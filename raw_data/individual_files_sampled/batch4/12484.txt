on Monday bloomberg reported that Facebook and Twitter and Microsoft have now decided to comply with the European Union's desire to crack down on terrorist communications they vowed to proactively shut down so-called hate speeches the report quote beyond national laws that criminalize hate speech there's a need to ensure such activity by Internet users is expeditiously reviewed by online intermediaries and social media platforms upon receipt of a valid notification in an appropriate time frame the companies in the European Commission said in a joint statement on Tuesday Twitter's head of public policy for Europe Karen White said we remain committed to letting the tweets flow however there is a clear distinction between freedom of expression and conducts that incites violence and hate now first things first okay these are private companies they have the right to decide in the marketplace what sort of speech they wish to provide a forum that said they don't have a right to commit fraud they can't tell people that they're for free speech and then reverse themselves by following certain politically correct rules about speech the distinction between quote freedom of expression and conduct that incites violence and hate is not as clear as white wants to make it for example a French Jewish group sued Facebook Twitter and Google and did so after notifying them about hate speech that they said promoted racism homophobia or anti-semitism and this begs two questions first who sets the standard of what promotes racism homophobia or anti-semitism second does all such speech actually constitute a threat to anyone the use of the term hate speech tends to gloss over these very serious questions Monica bickered who runs global policy management at Facebook she said there's no place for hate speech on Facebook but is it hate speech to cite Leviticus 18:22 about homosexuality is it hate speech to say that Michael Brown who is shot and killed by the cops in Ferguson was a thug according to the left probably is a hate speech to say that men can't become women and women can't be met become it well probably according to the left more importantly just because you don't like particular speech that doesn't make the speech dangerous there's a lot of speech people deem hateful that doesn't cross the line between being offensive and incitement to violence white conflates conduct that incites violence and hate that's too broad lots of speech incites hate but not very much speech actually incites violence there's a difference between Donald Trump saying provide a unique risk to national security and Isis giving specific orders to murder Jews the left uh tur confidence in its own ability to distinguish between quote unquote rightful speech and inappropriate speech for purposes of censorship should scare everybody listen I've been targeted routinely by anti-semitic speech in recent months I have never called for Twitter to ban those who practice such speech not only don't I even block them I generally follow Andrew Breitbart sould strategy of retweeting all the people who do this so the world can see them in their full glory it's one thing for online outlets to police actual law breaking activity it's another for them to pretend to represent free speech while they just curb speech they don't like I'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show tends to demonize people just don't care about your feelings we have returned and as usual every time we come back the world is a little bit crazier it's like the verse from deuteronomy you go to bed at night wishing it were the morning and you wake up in the morning wishing it were night again well we thought that it was gonna be crazy when we left and now it's so crazy that donald trump is answering questions about gorillas yes donald trump is answering question about apes not because there's an uprising and not because it's Planet of the Apes and we're gonna be beating our hands on the shores because the the Statue of Liberty is half buried in sand no he's answering questions about gorillas because the latest gorillas story that really must be told the latest in guerrilla warfare you might say is is over a Harambee the gorillas I don't know how to pronounce around BAE Harambee his Harambee the gorillas why don't we start with the actual tape of it's his clip too so here's the tape of Harambee the gorilla and in what has so a four year old boy I've heard reports three of her reports four does a matter of small kid falls into this enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo now I went to the zoo yesterday with my wife and purposefully tossed my kid in there she's being bad but I didn't actually do it but in any case at the Cincinnati Zoo apparently this mother lost track of her kid for five seconds anybody who's had a toddler knows there's always a moment literally once a day at least where you look around you go oh where did the kid go right there's always that moment where you look away for five seconds to glance down at your phone cuz somebody's calling and you look around and the kid is basically and the kid is by the stove turning on the flame putting their face in it like this is it every single day there's some thing like this and it doesn't matter how much I'm a real Hellcat like a real helicopter parent it doesn't matter how much of a helicopter parent you are kids are made for getting in trouble so his mother turns her back on the kid for one second and the kid is gone where'd the kid go the kid fell into the gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo which is funny but not really this is kind of scary so the kid falls down and it's apparently a 15-foot drop and just proving that kids are bouncy the kid doesn't get hurt but the kid falls down into this moat and Harambee the gorilla decides to intervene and so this 450 pound gorilla runs over to the kid now I'm gonna show you the tape of what this looks like people keep saying it's really super graphic it isn't super graphic I mean they don't this tape doesn't extend to the part where they actually do what they do to the gorilla which I'll tell you in a second but the girl that goes over and and this is the tape that's making the rounds and people are up in arms about it so here's what it looked like when Harambee seventeen-year-old 450 pound gorilla goes to this this four-year-old maybe 40 pound kid so you can see the kid the greatest standing in the former being favored the kids actually define the gorilla Oh or you can't see what happens past that so people that's waitin to subscribe so you can see what we're talking about this is one where the visual kind of is necessary so they end up what ends up happening is that then of shooting and killing the gorilla because the gorilla is agitated they don't know what the gorillas going to do and so they shoot and they kill the gorilla so number one it's a very sad story I mean the gorilla is on the gorillas fault I mean the gorilla is just sitting there in its own habitat and something there's a kid there and people are yelling at it it's a dummy animal I mean it's just it's it you don't expect a dumb animal to know what to do with the kid it doesn't look like he wants to hurt the kid if he wants to hurt the kid I mean he's 450 pound gorilla who can break a coconut with one hand so but that said you don't have a choice I mean once the kid is in the enclosure and the gorilla is now next to the kid if you hit the if you hit the gorilla with the tranq then the gorilla goes nuts and kills the kid if maybe if you if you don't do anything then the girl is standing around and even if the girl doesn't mean to the gorilla could just hold the kid underwater for a minute and kill the kid just just out of just by a just accidentally so Jack Hannah who's a who's one of the honour of directors of the Columbus Zoo a different zoo in the Ohio area um Jack Hanna who of course is famous for for kind of his Crocodile Hunter quasi routine he was on CNN he said of course you have to shoot the the gorilla you have no choice but to kill the gorilla I mean what could happen I've seen the gorillas a gorilla green coconut but you can either open with this sledgehammer I'm gonna take it push it like a marshmallow just like a marshmallow all he had to do is grab that child instead one hand there's so much damage like fatality for example in a split second you don't know for example doesn't like it like visitors that was their child in there what would they think okay and that's exactly right the zoo director held a press conference - lots of people were saying well why was how did this kid even get in there was it an unsafe enclosure okay I can tell anyone who's been to the zoo knows that no enclosure is entirely safe its designs keep the animals from jumping out it's not designed to prevent humans from jumping in cuz you have to be able to see the animals so much you're gonna build like giant glass screens around all of the cages the reality is that you're going to be in situations where you're in close proximity with the animals I mean wouldn't like we were by that they hit yesterday at the LA Zoo we were by the the hippo cage would not have been difficult for a kid to climb up and fall into the hippo cage not difficult at all and hippos are much more dangerous generally than silverback gorillas so the director of the zoo comes out and he's talking about this in here's what he had to say he had time to review what happens looking and they're in crisis mode at the time looking back would you make the same decision again yes looking back we would make the same decision I know that after it is over and the child is safe it's easy like a Monday Morning Quarterback to look at it and say wow wow wow don't we need to do this differently the people that say that I don't understand primate biology and silverback gorillas and the danger the child was in and B we're not there at an important time to make important decisions we said we stand by our decision we make the same call today okay so that's exactly right okay so there are been a bunch of reactions to this first of all this dominated the news over the weekend just dominated it was the only thing anyone was talking about cuz it's a bizarre story but more because there's a whole group of people who feel morally righteous about all they shouldn't have shot the gorillas Katie cuoco from from Big Bang Theory who obviously is an expert on treatment of gorillas she sounded I've said it's terrible they shot the gorilla bunch of celebrities that's awful they shot then definitely shouldn't have shot the gorilla okay anthropologists I'm sure that you know everything there is to know about gorilla treatment I'm gonna go with the people who spend their lives actually working with the gorillas by the way he knows the unhappiest person in the world about shooting that gorilla the zoo director I mean the zoo director first of all these things are endangered species he probably knew he probably knew something probably got to know the gorilla so this is not like all these people from afar going oh they're brutal they shot the gorilla shut up shut up but beyond that there's this tendency for people to have inordinate sympathy for animals that they don't have for human beings so the same people who are saying that his mother should be prosecuted for her kid falling into the enclosure these are the same people who if they if the mother just decided to kill the kid you know at nine months in the womb that would mean okay no problem that's cool that's totally fine the worship of animals in our society is just another evidence that our our practice of religion has gone downhill the notion that man is made in God's image but animals aren't right this this sort of notion religious notion that separates man from the animals once you wipe that away people start looking at okay well the gorillas more important than then the kid I mean after all is that kid gonna grow up to cure cancer is that kid gonna grow up to be anything special if he doesn't then look at that that animal bringing so much enjoyment to people and more than that he has every right to live on the planet there's a whole wing of the far-left environmentalist movement called the deep greens who really believe that man should be wiped off the planet in order to make room for all these Anik animals that kill and eat each other right it's it but this is there's a growing sentiment inside American society very easy moral tusks for people if you're a dog in a random human we're both drowning in a river which one do you save a huge percentage of Americans now say they'd saved the dog now there's certain people I wouldn't say because I know they're evil but if I was just a random person of course he saved the person it's not even a question you save the person in this case who do you save the gorilla or the four-year-old of course you saved the four-year-old isn't that even a question but we've become such an amoral society that we equate the four-year-old kid with the gorilla in fact not we actually treat the four-year-old with less value than we treat the gorilla because the girl is endangered there are lots of people on earth but there aren't that many silverback gorillas so scarcity means morality there's less gorillas therefore it's more important this is truly immoral behavior an animal is not a human being and if you fail to recognize that you end up by treating human beings as animals that's all that ends up happening human beings end up treated just like any other animal which is bad news altogether but people are going nuts over this the hashtag justice for Harambee trended I know what justice looks like where they want it electrocute somebody justice for Harambee and what insanity there's a makeshift vigil okay there are 250 people who are injured in an airstrike in Syria over the weekend hey this got 30 times more coverage than the airstrike in Syria that injured 250 people because it's easy to look at that tape and go oh the gorillas cute the girl is not doing anything wrong it's sad I'm sure there are a lot of cute kids who died in that airstrike but nobody seems to care about that I'm sorry to say Harambee just isn't that important I mean it's it's it's sad but on the scale of tragedy in the world this one ranks at about a three okay maybe that day I think that's on the upper end this one ranking in about a three this is not a massive tragedy that people should be getting super upset neither was Cecil the lion now somebody goes in hunts and kills a lion that got outed they went into the zimbabwean enclosure and forget about the fact that DuBose in Bob way and dictator has just right the country and the life expectancy in Zimbabwe is cut in half that doesn't matter but somebody killed him I knew who the sort of anthropomorphic worship of animals all these people who watched The Lion King and then they think lions are their friends or they watch Tarzan and then these watch this and they go oh my god they just killed Rosie O'Donnell's character in Tarzan wait I'm sorry this just isn't this important in the broad scheme of things and if you do think that this was that important then it's because you have a skewed sense of priorities then there's a bunch of people who are blaming the zoo and they got Piers Morgan whose IQ is slightly lower than that of Harambee tweeting out our IP Harambee a magnificent gorilla dies because a zoo failed to make its barriers safe first of all the zoo hasn't had anybody fall into it since this was created in 1978 the place is examined every single year more than once by the USDA and the National Zoo so it met all the safety standards it turns out the kids can get into pretty much anywhere and so this is it that's how then there are the people who say they should prank the gorillas we say this is dumb and finally there are the people who blame the mother and this includes people like Piers Morgan taking their eye off the ball no child should ever be able to crawl into a gorilla compound Ricky's gervase he says it seems some gorillas make better parents than some people highly doubtful since gorillas are actually known if I'm not mistaken for killing the stepchildren of the of their mates Oh mmm probably not but he says some gorillas make better parents listen as a helicopter parents I look at this and I go oh my god this parent is terrible and then I think for five seconds about what I told you before about the you turn your back thing with kids there's not a babysitter alive there's not a person alive who's babysitting a small toddler kids run around if you have more than one to watch it's very difficult it's very difficult and apparently shouldn't more than one to watch at the zoo so sometimes and this is an important point sometimes there's no one to blame when bad things happen sometimes bad things just happen in this case thank God the kid wasn't killed the kid wasn't really hurt but sometimes the world is just a bad place and bad things just happen and it doesn't have to be anybody's fault doesn't mean something terrible anybody did anything terrible but it's but but people are constantly looking because because they can't accept that the universe is unfair they they are constantly looking for somebody to blame in this case there really is nobody to blame and the people who value the apes over the humans it is just beyond me okay but no story would be complete in the same no story would be complete without Donald Trump sounding off on it so we now have the presidential candidate for the Republicans answering questions about gorillas the irony here of course is that national reviews Kevin Williamson labeled his original article about Donald Trump declaring witless a prides escalator so now Donald Trump is is talking about gorillas I have to say that the Donald Trump taught this probably is the highlight of the presidential season so far as Donald Trump being asked about gorillas somebody asked a question on CNN they said would Donald Trump is is a headline for this clip say would Donald Trump have killed gorillas the answer is no the gorilla would kill Donald Trump I mean put them in a cage match that sucker ain't close but here's Donald Trump talking about the the gorilla of it and to be fair this is I mean if we're really gonna go along with the jungle book analogies this is King Louie the the orange the orange talking about but I'll be talking about talking about the gorillas okay here we go there were moments with the gorillas the way he held that child it was almost like a mother holding a baby looks so beautiful and calm and there were moments where look pretty dangerous I don't think they had a choice I mean probably they didn't have a choice you have a child a young child is at stake and you know it's too bad there wasn't another way I thought it was so beautiful to watch that you know powerful almost 500-pound gorilla the way he dealt with that little boy but it just takes one second okay so what he's saying is right but just hearing Donald Trump do the play-by-play of amusing there's no way around it he's like a sports announcer and then look at that gorilla he's holding his hand and then boom he's gone okay all right so you know so Donald Trump continues to dominate the headlines and this is what Trump knows that Hillary Clinton doesn't Hillary Clinton so Donald Trump in a press conference which we'll get to in just a few minutes here Donald Trump dinner press conference and and he talked about veterans and giving money to veterans and he talked about guerrillas and he talked about various things Hillary Clinton has not done a press conference and I think for months been in a hundred and sixty days something like that that's why Trump is in the headlines and Hillary isn't because he'll he'll do press conferences Hawaiian during the press conferences but he'll do them Trump understands the media and we'll get back to that in just a second first we need to take a moment we need to we need to pay homage to the supposed third party that was going to rise in this election cycle and that is Libertarian Party so there's been a lot of talk about third parties because nobody likes Trump and nobody likes Hillary so maybe there will be a third party so Bill Kristol announced over the weekend that this Thursday he's going to announce a third party candidate who's very serious and he said that Trump is very upset about it he tweeted out I'm traveling so I hadn't realized that so upset real Donald Trump I'm sorry the mere mention of an independent candidate has so unnerved him and then ben Carson who's a trump campaign started get the worst campaign surrogate in history he came out he said there shouldn't there definitely should not be a third party candidate because it'll just destroy the Republican Party America right now it's like a cruise ship that is about to go off in Niagara Falls with tremendous carnage and death what you have to do first is recognize the problem stop the ship turn it around and then move in the other direction I'm hoping that whoever that third party candidate is will just stop for a moment and think about what the implications are of allowing Hillary Clinton or someone like her to get in there and they get two to four Supreme Court picks and completely change the nature of this country and destroy the prospects for their children and their grandchildren to have the same opportunities that they had okay so there it is and by the way if you're wondering why in this particular tape Steve Doocy looks really young that's because his son Peter Doocy sitting there on Fox and Friends but ben Carson well America is kind of like it's kind of like a ship and it's a ship that took a poop ship like one of those places where the septic system broke and the poop is flowing out of the various toilets and it's turned over it's almost over but the captain of the ship is has bailed out on the ship and it's turning over completely and and I think that all we can do right now is just say that America is beautiful okay so so ben Carson says we shouldn't have it we shouldn't have a third party all right so we shouldn't have a third party according to according to Ben Carson his case becomes somewhat stronger when you actually what happened at the Libertarian Party convention so the Wilbert Aryan party is is uh I consider myself when it comes to government largely libertarian because I think that the government is terrible at everything and I think that every time the government expands personal freedom contracts unfortunately the Libertarian Party is it appears almost entirely comprised of insane nutbag loon bag crazy people so here is a clip this guy is running for the part of the chair of the Libertarian Party and and here is how he decided to make his case to the libertarians that he ought to be the head of the Libertarian Party and folks this is what I'm telling you again you need to subscribe so you can see the visuals here I will try to narrate as this happens but this guy he does something unique his name is James lark and he does something to to talk he does something unique and we'll just watch it go ahead start it okay okay James lark is a large red bearded man he's wearing a he's wearing a black suit and another time and now he's danced around I'm still shocked and this is gonna go pretty much where you think it's the worst nightmares in the worst dimensions and the crystal proud and looks like a bunch of people literally spend all day be banished from playing Dungeons and Dragons here's this guy dancing around this is a business case this is his case for me to share before honey and although the suspenders and Lobos the time oh yes Lindsay oh yes Lindsay and now people are the crown covering their eyes there goes his shirt and this guy has larger best defenses the holiday shoulder he's taking off his pants and he's wearing a thong and it is horrifying so this is this is what a nine major party and somebody just ran by and put money in his thong so I don't know if he's making the case for that's how the government ought to raise money but if so we'll be broke pretty quickly that is horrifying so this is what happens at the Libertarian Party convention clearly this is a party to be reckoned with people who should take super seriously and my friend larry elder did a debate between the various libertarian party candidates and it just demonstrates what the libertarian party is that because such a bunch of purists and i'm listen i'm ideologically pure as people know i tend to be a purist but I voted for Mitt Romney I voted for John McCain even though I don't like them okay because I believe that sometimes half a loaf is better than no loaf at all I get that argument I believe in that argument is general rule the libertarian party doesn't believe that they're purists what's odd about them is they just nominated Gary Johnson who's actually a relatively large government guy he expanded the budget in New Mexico when he was governor he's somebody who is pro-choice he's somebody who believes in the in the in the government forcing Baker's to participate in same-sex weddings and such that's their new nominee but they debate larry elder who's a libertarian he he did the debate he moderated the debate and this just shows how out of touch they are they're asking questions about the 1964 Civil Rights Act last I checked it is now 2016 I was born I was born 20 years after the 64 Civil Rights Act nonetheless this is a major topic of contention at the Libertarian Party convention the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended discrimination in both the private sector and the public sector Senator Barry Goldwater voted against it for libertarian reasons he did not feel that was the government's job to tell a private business owner what to do senator Al Gore's senior voted against it because he opposed integration if you had been in the Senate how would you have voted I would have voted for it and he gets booted okay no elaboration nope you see have more time okay mr. Peterson repeat the question one more time it was kind of wide Civil Rights Act of 1964 into discrimination in both the private sector and the public sector senator Barry Goldwater voted against it for libertarian reasons feeling that it wasn't the government's job to tell a private owner what to do senator Al Gore senior voted against it because he imposed racial integration how would you have voted had you been in the Senate wait you just sorry you're asking whether or not I would have signed this civil rights legislation in you're wondering why the libertarians aren't able to pick up any steam yeah number one these are the sorts of questions that are taken seriously at the debates at number two everybody on the stage is apparently hi Gary Johnson who's a big pot advocate and his smoked pot publicly Gary Johnson is obviously wait so you're asking a question I just answered a second ago I'm sorry dude I just kind of drifted off there well I'm still here okay yes yes that guy's the nominee by the way the other people on the stage include John McAfee who invited who invented McAfee Antivirus and who I believe was was a suspect in a murder I think so he's so it's it's it's it's a group of oddballs but but okay so in any case be it by the way the answer on the 64 Civil Rights Act if you want to give their their multiple answers I say that the Civil Rights Act of 64 does go too far in terms of restricting private sector behavior they don't have any right to tell somebody in the private sector what they do with their business if somebody is a terrible discriminatory racist jackass then we ought to start a business across the street from them and run them out of business it's not the government's job to tell me who I can and cannot participate in business with okay that's my answer to that as far as what I assigned it in 64 my answer is probably yeah I would have signed it in 64 but then I would have looked to repeal the sections that have to do with the private sector right because it's more important to get of what the government is doing wrong and then we can minimize government later that would be the proper answer to that okay so but that's not the the end of the of the questions that make libertarians look insane Larry then asks them about driver's licenses here we go should someone have to have a government-issued license to drive a car hell no dr. Feldman a car is like a gun or anything else as long as you're using it right and not using it to hurt other people you should have a right to use it a license in a permit is just another way to get some money and inconvenience to be okay so nice tie from from this dude he he apparently got his tie over at the fireworks store but it's but okay so that so these are the questions that gas it at libertarian debate when was the last time Lindsey Mathis was the last time you guys chat around considering should we have driver's licenses or not in the pantheon of issues important to you in America should we have driver's licenses or not not really high ranking not something I think super important now on principle I'm a basically agree with the idea that driver's licenses don't really accomplish all that much because the fact is there are plenty of incompetent drivers on the road they're still killing people a lot of them don't have insurance we live in Southern California there are tons of people without insurance driving around there's nothing you can do about it but this is not high on the priority list right this is not a high priority okay and then if you thought that was too high priority for you not not high priority enough for you here is something that's really high priority would you have engaged in Worlds War one and two I almost couldn't I love Larry but I almost couldn't wait til he got to the War of the Roses what would your position have been on the War of the Roses would you've been for the Lancaster's or what have you have been for the York's like where where did you stand on that one but here the end the candidates being asked about World Wars one and two was it wrong for America to have intervened and fought in World War one was it wrong for America to have intervened and fought in World War two it was wrong to intervene in World War one because the sinking of Lusitania actually they found out that there were munitions so they were violating the law by sneaking munitions in past the embargo but when after we are attacked in World War two we have every right to defend ourselves but we would have never gotten involved if World War two if would have stayed the hell out of World War one standing out on World War one in isolationism there are a lot of bright people and I'm sure if they could find a way not to get into war they would have done it I don't have the egotism to try to say that I have a better idea to what I've done at that time it was a horrible situation and I don't know whether anything could have been done differently mr. MacAfee repeat the question please was it wrong for America to have intervene and fought in World War was the craze long for America to have intervened in fought in World War two well in World War two I mean our entire Pacific Fleet was destroyed we certainly have the right to defend ourselves what would have happened had we not gotten into the war in World War one a far more complex affair and way beyond my time I am sorry I do not have the information to answer yes by the way John McAfee ended up moving to Belize after after he spent a lifetime basically doing hard drugs then you found McAfee Antivirus and he blew all of his money and ended up in Belize and now he's back running for the Libertarian Party so very exciting Gary Johnson the guy in the center who doesn't know what question is being asked that guy ended up with the libertarian nomination on the second ballot yesterday so all very very exciting stuff the libertarian convention and this demonstrates gang why ideological purity well a nice thing is not the be-all end-all it turns out that you actually have to answer questions that are relevant to the last I don't know 80 years of American politics like a cut-off date you know the last eighty years I think would be a nice place to be you know asking about whether we would have gotten into war with the Kaiser is what we would have done with the Hun that seems a little bit odd to me but you know that's how good so yes the Libertarian Party as the legit third-party candidacy not so much okay meanwhile Donald Trump continues to to stump the press and I will say this there's if there's one thing I like about Donald Trump and I've said many things I do not like about Donald Trump but if there's one thing I like about Donald Trump is that he's always on the tack against the press all the time and they deserve it because for example Katie Couric the the former NBC news anchor she made a documentary about guns is very anti-gun documentary and there's part of the documentary where she inserted a break in the documentary she's having conversation with people she inserted a false pause to make it look like they didn't know the answer to her question to make them look stupid this came out and now she's out apologizing for it her documentary has now been pulled from epics which is one of these online channels here's correct apologizing if there are no background checks for gun purchasers how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun so then they they're gonna play the audio showing how this actually worked right so the audio was basically right away she asks the question they answered the question and now she's apologized okay fine so that's and that's Katie Couric she was a respected member of the media she's a liar Brian Williams over the weekend it was Memorial Day over the weekend and and President Obama gave what I thought was one of the most egregious speeches in American history in her Oshima he basically made the case that us dropping the bomb in Hiroshima was immoral that the only way to stop violence in the future is with moral relativism which is precisely the opposite of the truth if you want to insure another nuclear attack all you have to do is keep promoting the idea that all cultures are worthy all cultures are decent because they aren't but in any case Brian Williams cereal fabulous Brian Williams he's on MSNBC now because it's impossible to lose your job in the media and Brian Williams is asked about Hiroshima and here was his explanation of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki it is and that is still the threat that people worry about that this material will fall into the wrong hands if people have found the u.s. to be preachy in the years since Hiroshima and Nagasaki about the use of nuclear weapons it's because we're the only nation to have used them in anger sometimes I am amazed that the world has been without these weapons all the years since but it is a point of great pride by the people who've seen to it okay fine so so but we used it in anger okay we didn't use him in anger it was a considered decision to end World War two it did end world war two it probably saved a million American lives who would have had to storm the beaches of Japan and but what were the bad guys because we use it so the media lie all the time what this leads to is Donald from smacking the media so Donald Trump this is the thing that I like about Donald Trump Donald Trump makes a habit I was smacking the media this clip 26 Oh Donald Trump is is do heat a press conference today about the veteran so I'm gonna tell you one thing I like about Donald Trump right out that he smacks the media and then I'm gonna tell you it also sort of carries the seeds of one of the things I don't like about Donald Trump so here is here's Donald Trump yeah I think you've set a new bar today for being contentious with the press corps kind of calling us losers to our faces and all that is this no not all of you just many of you enough of us is this what is it is this what its gonna be like coloring you if you're president yeah let me have this guy okay yeah it is it's gonna be like this David if the press writes false stories like they did with this because you know half of you are amazed that I raised all of this money if the press writes false stories like they did where I wanted to keep a low profile I didn't want the credit for raising all this money for the vets I wasn't looking for the profit and by the way more money is coming in I wasn't looking for the credit but I had no choice but to do this because the press was saying I didn't raise any money for them not only did I raise it much of it was given a long time ago and there is a vetting process and I think you understand that but when I raise almost 6 million dollars and probably in the end will raise more than 6 because more is going to come in and is coming in but when I raise 5.6 million as of today more is coming in and I and and this is going to phenomenal groups and I have many of these people vetting the people that are getting the money and working hard and then we have to read store probably libelous stores or certainly close in the newspapers and the people know the stories are false I'm gonna continue to attack the press look I find the press to be extremely dishonest I find the political press to be unbelievably dishonest I will say that okay and then he calls one of them ABC's Tom llamas he calls him a stump a sleazebag doesn't a sleazy sleazy guys it sleazebag okay so I like the idea that he's gonna attack the press here is my end and I've said before I've I was attacking the press long before Donald Trump was attacking the press I've been saying for 10 years 15 years but the idea that anybody should be allowing George Stephanopoulos to get through a full interview without saying to him at the outset George you were in a Hillary Clinton's war room you have no credibility on this issue is ridiculous okay but but Trump is doing what I've said so he's taking my tactic he's attacking the press here's the thing I don't like about Donald Trump he's a liar so Donald Trump is taking their there they're building of their tower of lies and he's tearing it down great great he's doing a full King Kong he's tearing down the Tower of lies spectacular then he stands in the rubble of the lies and then he lies right so in this particular case this happens to be one of the rare cases one of the only cases that I know of where the media is actual honest so what happened is that Donald Trump you remember this Donald Trump skipped the Fox News debate where megyn kelly was moderating and he did his I'm gonna raise money for the veterans routine mainly because he didn't want to go up against megyn kelly and the other candidate so he does his I'm gonna raise money for the veterans routine and then he says that night we've raised six million dollars for the veterans and I myself have time to check for a million dollars to veterans groups he says it's back in January and that's the last you hear of it and but he keeps saying yeah I've raised so much money for the veterans I love the veterans I raised so much money for them I signed a million dollar check so Washington Post has a reporter named Jared David Farenthold and David Farenthold investigated and what he found is that there were zero veterans groups that had said that Trump and given them a million dollars so did he actually do it last week last week I remember now what the data is okay the date today is May 31st we're almost in June so it's almost been six months since Trump said this last week Donald Trump signed a million-dollar check to a veteran's group after these reports ran and then he turns around he calls the the media dishonest then he calls the media dishonest I agree the media's dishonest but in this case he was dishonest so this is the thing I love about Trump and also the thing I hate Trump has a habit of picking the right opponents and then doing all all the bad things his opponents do while tearing them down this is the part that I dislike about Trump and meanwhile the Republican Party is is getting behind Donald Trump force where they're getting behind him Foursquare so and tactically gladdy attacks the media but he's he's obviously somebody who doesn't tell the truth doesn't matter the Republican Party's gonna get behind him anyway I mean I heard a radio host this morning who shall remain nameless playing this clip of Trump going it's true that the political press is dishonest and then not mentioning any of the context that I just gave you so I'm honest enough to tell you the political press is dishonest that doesn't mean they're wrong and lying all the time sometimes Trump is wrong in lying also in any case Mitch McConnell so remember that remember that time it was I'm old enough to remember this I'm old enough to remember a time when Donald Trump was not an establishment guy right where he was anti-establishment who's gonna change the way politics worked Donald Trump was gonna go in there he's a living rebuke he was a human middle finger to Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan he was a human middle finger to the Mitt Romney's to the party a Mitch McConnell Senate Majority Leader he's now coming out and he's saying no no we can't have a third party a third party would just be completely disrespectful and terrible we can't do it so you have endorsed Donald Trump yeah and you're saying does that mean you approve of all that he's done well I mean let me put it this way we know what we get with Hillary Clinton four more years just like the last eight and we know the average American is about $3,000 you're worse off now than they were when President Obama came to office the country's yearning for a change and my view is four more years like the last eight is not good for the country he won the nomination Ference where he went out there and competed like everybody else you got the most votes and I think it's disrespectful of the Republican electorate to say I'm smarter than you are and I'm not going to support your choice so what have you said to Paul Ryan in regards to that then he still has not endorsed well you know Paul has his own view of this my view is the Republican primary voters have spoken I know what we get with Hillary Clinton and I'd rather take my chances on somebody new who I think particularly with regard to the Supreme Court is going to appoint people that I think would be better for the country okay so that's all wonderful except for the fact that he's now embracing everything that the Trump is so put that quote in the back here mind right Trump is gonna do all these great things Hillary's awful Obama's awful now listen McConnell here okay so McConnell is going to explain he's a spy QQ it is Trump going to change the nature of the Republican Party here's Mitch McConnell's answer well whether he has or not he's not going to change the Republican Party you know we've had nominees before who were not deeply into Republican politics and philosophies think of Eisenhower for example but Trump is not going to change the institution he's not going to change the basic philosophy of the party and I'm comfortable voting for him because on the big things that I think have the greatest impact on the future of the country at the top of the list of Supreme Court I think you respond okay so there it is okay you can't have it both ways you can't have it both ways you can't say the Donald Trump isn't gonna shape the party and then say I like Donald Trump I'm getting behind him Foursquare everything he does is hunky-dory with me you can't have it both ways this is the problem and for all those people who say that Mitch McConnell isn't gonna make deals with Trump he seems pretty sanguine about Donald Trump doesn't he for all the people who say that Trump isn't gonna cut deals with macomb McConnell seems kind of okay with all this doesn't so again all Trump is just a giant human inkblot he's a Rorschach test and so you can have people is he so you have Mitch McConnell saying Trump won't change the GOP and literally at the exact same time on TV you got Rudy Giuliani saying Trump is a demonstration that our politics can change he will change the GOP and without denigrating them in any way I think he's a real hope for us that our politics can finally change you and I both know Donald really well and we know he's a deal maker and I know that somehow people think that means compromising your principles I think that means accomplishing your principles I think that means if I believe in lower taxes maybe I can't get all the lower taxes I wanna deal I can get some if I believe in let's regulate maybe I can't get a little get rid of all the regulations but I sure as heck can get rid of most of them and if I believe in defeating the Ayatollah don't know what will happen okay so he says there the Trump is the hope that politics can change that Newt Gingrich saying that there will be Trump Americans they're not Republicans they're not Democrats they're Trump Americans and then we've got Mitch McConnell saying the party is gonna change so here is Sean Hannity and Newt Gingrich both vying for Donald Trump's VP slot here's Newt Gingrich explaining that there will be Trump Americans all over the world Trump Americans it'll all be Trump it'll all be trans like Gloria Swanson at the end of Sunset Boulevard and blazing lights everywhere it'll be Trump look I believe and you heard it here for the first time so you can keep this and play it later on the air just as there were once Reagan Democrats I think they're going to be Trump Americans and then actually people rush into side the Republican the next day but they're going to say look to make America great again I'm going to be for Donald Trump they're gonna be in all 50 states they're going to be in places you never expected and I think we're gonna have a new map as I said I'm blue because it's the old order replace replace red and blue it's the old order it's the Trump order now they'll be in places you never expected you'll open your baking closet and boom there's a Trump supporter you get up in the morning and out from the bed creeps a stubby orange hand and it's a Trump supporter okay so so you can't have it both ways gang either Trump's gonna transform the party or he's not if he's not he's going to keep people like Mitch McConnell in power because that's what Trump does if he is gonna transform the party he's gonna transform it into trumpism not into conservatism either way we don't have a particularly good solution to any of our problems all that said the good news for Donald Trump is that Hillary Clinton is worse at everything in every possible way it is possible to be terrible she is just a smoking garbage heap of the campaign I mean she is she's a she's the wreckage of the Death Star she's just glowing glowing bits of nothing floating off into space she's awful here's what she said today this is legit quote from Hillary Clinton she said she encountered people on rope lines who tell her quote I really admire you I really like you I just don't know if I can vote for a woman to be President these are things no one has ever said in the history of humanity and a rope on her own event people are going there just to tell her I can't vote for you cuz F giant a lady there's a leg really that's that's that's happening yeah they're good by the way Diane Feinstein who's a top Hillary ally she gave what I thought was the funniest comment to the weekend she was she was asked about Hillary Clinton server and Diane Feinstein who is D not California's two senators the stupidest woman in the history of American politics Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein she of the lifeless ids and Dianne Feinstein she of the knife feces was on I think there's ABC News and and she's asked about Hillary's email server listen to this answer it's amazing I think questions are asked and answers are sometimes taken out of context Hillary Clinton broke no law I read all 42 pages of the report the conclusion of the report does not say that what it says is that the department does not handle these electronic I perform operations well and needs to do better hillary herself has said yes I made a mistake if I had a chance to do it over again I'd do it differently I mean what do people want I say enough is enough let's get to the major problems facing this nation but mrs. Clinton has said that has been it was widely known that she was using her personal email but if you look at this report it says that when State Department staffers expressed concerns about the arrangement their supervisor quote instructed the staff never to speak of the Secretary's personal email system again that sure sounds like somebody trying to hide something oh wait a second I don't believe was trying to hide anything I've known Hillary for a quarter of a century let me tell you what I do think I think this is a woman who wants a little bit of a private life she wants to be able to communicate with husband with daughter and not have somebody looking over her shoulder into email so that's that's Hillary's defender is that Hillary wants a little bit of a private life so she can coordinate with bill what when she doesn't have to be home so the Energizer can come over a nail bill what yeah this is Hillary's defender yeah Hillary's got troubles getting and what it has some serious okay time for something I like and then something I don't like so a book that i'm that i just finished over the weekend is it's called who needs the Fed by John Tammany this is from encounter books they have a whole series of really good kind of shorter books that have coming out now about economics and basically it breaks down what exactly the Federal Reserve does and whether it's worthwhile and he makes a case which III don't really agree with him he makes the case that basically the stock market boom and the real estate boom are not due to Fed policy he says that that was basically due to governmental regulation and he makes the case that we don't need the Fed anymore you may have noticed a pattern on my economics reading George Gilder makes the same case now the Federal Reserve in my opinion is in a highly overrated Institute it doesn't doesn't accomplish any of the goals that it was set out to accomplish in the first place at least it doesn't accomplish anything that couldn't be accomplished equally in the private sector up to and including Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stuff you know if you go to the bank you have five hundred thousand in the bank the bank goes bust the feds reimburse you up to 250 you should be able to buy insurance for that through your bank right it shouldn't be you shouldn't have to have we don't have that in any other area of life why do you need it from the federal government here I mean I have car insurance right by it every dive home insurance so in any case it's it's an interesting book and it's a quick read so you should take a look at that okay things that I hate so there's this Democrat named Barbara Norton and and she's in the Louisiana State Legislature the Louisiana State Legislature took up a bill recently that would get students to recite a portion of the Declaration of Independence in schools Barbara Norton got up and here's what she had to say about the Declaration of Independence african-americans were slaves and for you too and for you bring a bill to request that our children will recite the Declaration I think it's a little bit unfair to us to have those children to recite something that's not the truth then you don't think that all men are created living you're saying that's true and for you to exile children to repeat the declaration stating that all means a free I think there's some fair okay was not even boy okay we can stop it there okay in 1776 dr. King was not even born yes this is factually true also true when Declaration of Independence is written as a highly aspirational document the founders originally had a provision that would have abolished slavery in the Declaration of Independence or at least condemned the British Empire for importing slavery into the colonies the South bucked at that if you wanted to have a free independent country you needed to have consensus so that you would actually not have a divided country at the very outset which is why slavery was sort of taken off the table in the Declaration of Independence but started to be phased out by the Constitution of the United States okay this idea that the Declaration of Independence this is like saying that that great things that happen in the Bible right in the Bible there's talk of slavery there is there's talk of slavery you capture people and more to keep them as slaves you not keep the mislaid there's a lot of talk in the Bible about this sort of thing this is like saying that when it says let my people go a phrase that dr. King was fond of using right that the Bible countenance slavery therefore we can't use it dr. King by the way fond of quoting the Declaration of Independence right fond of quoting the Declaration of Independence and saying that this was the the halcyon cry this was the this was what America was all about we weren't living up to our founding ideals unfortunately I think there's a tendency on the left to say that because American history was imperfect in their ugly areas of American history that means American founding principles are ingrained and wrong and therefore we have to overthrow the entire system as a whole that's scary stuff when you're talking about the creation of the greatest country in the history of mankind on the best ideals ever thought up by man or God by the way it's it's this is frightening stuff and it comes out of historical ignorant because the fact is again the Declaration of Independence was specifically phrased in the way that it was because the idea was that it was supposed to provide for the future freedom of all human beings not even humans relegated to the United States human beings everywhere okay well we'll be back tomorrow to talk a little bit more about that and other topics hopefully the the guerrilla warfare will have died down by that point and we can talk about other things aside from Harambee but i'm sure there will be plenty to talk about i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
