scientists across many fields have tackled this question they can't agree on one shape size or color but some suggest there are key traits no intelligent alien being can live without for example living on land in order to develop rocket technology binocular vision to judge distance eyes near the brain to minimize the time it takes the brain to receive and process signals at least two legs for mobility and hands with at least three fingers to firmly grip and manipulate tools when you put all these together aliens might look a lot like we do that's not a surprise according to the world leading expert on evolution Richard Dawkins Dawkins has said that the building blocks of biology like protein and DNA could be the same everywhere it does look as though protein has got some very very important properties that might have to be universal if that's the case then all life across the cosmos could evolve similarly to Earth's eventually creating beings that walked and even talked like Homo sapiens of course there are some who challenge this idea astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has argued that aliens are probably made of the same chemicals as us helium carbon and oxygen but that doesn't necessarily mean they have to resemble human form if anything is certain it is that life elsewhere in the universe intelligent or otherwise we'll look at least as exotic as some of Earth's own life forms who is right that's something only the aliens can answer
