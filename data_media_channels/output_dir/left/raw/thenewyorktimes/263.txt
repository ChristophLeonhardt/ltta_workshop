1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,185
“Ain’t no justice.”
“Ain't no justice.”

2
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:08,985
“We are the change.”
“We are the change.”

3
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:10,295
“I am exasperated

4
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:12,370
by what the Parkland
students had to endure.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,890
I am agitated that this is what
had to be done to unite us.“

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,050
“I think you should
arm us with books,

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,690
instead of arming us
with weapons.“

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,500
“I’m angry that I have to worry
about losing another brother

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,930
to gun violence.

10
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,460
I’m angry that as we
walk down the street,

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,800
we talk about it as if
it’s a regular thing,

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,220
but it’s not.“

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,730
"Every one of
us in here has experienced

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,860
violence in our community.

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,470
So how has this affected
us and our goals

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,660
and our hopes and our dreams."

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,960
"I lost my brother to a
shootout.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,750
And I’ve been in countless
occasions of just violence

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,240
about trying to be robbed.

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,460
Or just trying to get away 
from a dangerous situation."

21
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,270
"I know it’s different for me.

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,140
I come in here as
your teacher, but I’ve

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,630
lost three students
over the past years."

24
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,849
"You can go outside one day
and not know what's going to

25
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,050
happen to you.

26
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,410
Like you could be innocent
and all that other stuff.

27
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,400
You could be in the
middle of something

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,170
and just get shot."

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,930
"Thank you for engaging it.
This is a hard conversation.

30
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,240
I'm really proud of you."

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,000
He’s just 15 years old,

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,540
but Ke'Shon Newman has
had to grow up fast.

33
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,790
Two years ago, his brother
was shot and killed

34
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,324
around the corner
from his house.

35
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,750
"He was walking back from taking
his girlfriend to the bus stop.

36
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,140
And he was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

37
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,700
And there was a shootout down the block.

38
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,470
And he was shot.

39
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,490
He was shot nine times,
and was killed

40
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,720
at the hospital."

41
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,680
His brother
Randall was 16 years

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,390
old when he was killed.

43
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,150
"He didn’t even deserve to have
his life taken away.

44
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,830
I thought I would have had enough
time to still hang out

45
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,770
with him, still just
have fun, just grow up

46
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,150
with him. To have it cut

47
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,710
so short is a 
tragic thing."

48
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,570
The South Side
of Chicago

49
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,830
is a world away from
Parkland, Fla.,

50
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,450
where 17 people were killed
in a mass school shooting.

51
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,120
But young people here say
that the country is finally

52
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,990
waking up to a reality
they face every day:

53
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,990
Gun violence.

54
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,990
"In my school,

55
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,830
I don’t really think of it as
a place for a mass shooting

56
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,100
cause most — most stuff,
that happens outside of school.

57
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,910
But what I have in common
with the kids in Parkland

58
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,570
is that I know how
it feels to lose someone

59
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,640
that’s close to you."

60
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,040
Ke'Shon lives in the Auburn
Gresham neighborhood

61
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,870
of Chicago’s South Side.

62
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,040
It’s one of the city’s
most dangerous areas,

63
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,790
but there’s a strong
sense of community here.

64
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,820
The homicide rate in this
area is 10 times that

65
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,600
of the national average.

66
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,210
And gun violence
in this community

67
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,950
is mostly gang related.

68
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,390
"You will not hear about a kid
going into a Chicago high school

69
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,230
and shooting up a school.

70
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,730
That’s not our reality
of gun violence.

71
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,680
But they can leave school and 
on the block where they live,

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,160
and they can get caught in the crossfire
between rival gangs."

73
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,990
Lamar Johnson mentors Ke'Shon
and other kids at a violence

74
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,050
prevention program

75
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,210
he runs at St. Sabina,
a church in the area.

76
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,185
"It’s a jungle.

77
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:29,060
You have to be alert.

78
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,690
You have to be aware,
because there's a lot going on.

79
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,840
It’s a lot of good people here.

80
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,390
But at the same time,
it’s a lot of dangers as well."

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,940
"I have to make sure that
I’m not in the wrong place

82
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,090
at the wrong time because
a situation can come out

83
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,770
of nowhere just from
the wrong person, having

84
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,260
the — a terrible mindset to
actually want to kill someone

85
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,480
or to shoot down a block."

86
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,180
Lamar took some kids from
the South Side of Chicago

87
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,420
to Florida to meet with
the Parkland survivors.

88
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,470
They went to share their stories
and their collective grief.

89
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,510
"We was talking about
the differences

90
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,430
between how gun violence
has affected them

91
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,340
that day versus the
everyday reality.

92
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,380
So I was sitting there
with a smirk on my face

93
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,649
like, well, I was — I basically told them
I said, 'Well, no disrespect.

94
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,800
Welcome to our world.

95
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,500
And I mean this 
with true sincerity.'

96
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,010
And when I said that one of
the students was like, 'Well,

97
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,770
I want to apologize to
you because I understand

98
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,870
the reason why we
have this platform

99
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,170
is because we're privileged.'"

100
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,060
"So y'all, I can tell y'all alright,
y'all good?"

101
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,870
Ever since the Florida shooting,

102
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,460
he’s led his youth group through
some difficult conversations.

103
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,880
"First of all, let’s name
some of the similarities

104
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
and differences, we have apart.

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,190
Yeah."

106
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,240
"To the Parkland kids this
happened one time.

107
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,300
But to the people of
Chicago, here, this happens a lot."

108
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,220
"So if somebody you know 
got shot, and somebody they know

109
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,260
got shot, the feeling's going
to be the same."

110
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,910
"Regardless of how many
times you experience it,

111
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,670
if they experienced it one,
two times

112
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,550
they still going to feel
traumatized

113
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,430
because that was a
moment that happened."

114
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,310
"So let me ask,

115
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,220
do you feel we get the same
attention?"

116
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,490
"No. Not at all."

117
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,720
"So you think

118
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,600
Chicago doesn't get attention
for its gun violence?"

119
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,320
"That area was nice and
had, like, wealthy —

120
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,620
it was nice. It was
suburban."

121
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,210
"You wouldn't have
expected it."

122
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,910
"You’re not — you're not angry
at Parkland.

123
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,220
You want to know why?
Parkland is with us."

124
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,250
Young people like
Rie'onna

125
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,420
Holmon say that the threat
of violence is always around them.

126
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,140
"What happened in Florida
happens here every day

127
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,520
17, more than 17 people
die a year here.

128
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,990
More than 17 people
die a week here.

129
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,400
And I think now they understand
that connection is going on."

130
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,120
She’s 15 years old and says the
dangers in her community marked

131
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,360
her entire childhood.

132
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,770
"Growing up on the South Side of Chicago

133
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,630
is really fearful.

134
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,432
We can't go outside and just
sit on our porch, or just

135
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:58,390
ride around our
neighborhoods on our bikes

136
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,050
like they can in
different neighborhoods."

137
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,740
Rie'onna, Ke'Shon and others
are all heading to Washington

138
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,670
to take part in the national
march against gun violence.

139
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,790
"It's probably going to choke
me up.

140
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,370
I'm probably going to cry mostly
because it's a bunch of youth

141
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,070
all working together to
achieve one goal.

142
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,573
And that's never happened before."

143
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,070
Just a week
before the march,

144
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,230
a conversation born out of
tragedy between young people

145
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,270
more than a thousand miles
apart came to life.

146
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,920
Survivors from the
Parkland shooting

147
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,370
traveled to Chicago for a
chance to see firsthand what

148
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,470
life is like on the
South Side.

149
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,670
"When I’m with these other students
and people from Chicago,

150
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,950
I feel their pain."

151
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,110
"This isn’t just in schools.

152
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,790
This is anywhere and everywhere."

153
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,660
"There shouldn’t be no fear
inside someone's heart

154
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,660
just for them to live their
life every day."

155
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,230
"Pain is pain.

156
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,080
It doesn’t matter
what ethnicity you

157
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,310
are, where you come
from, where you live,

158
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,520
how much money you make.

159
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,990
What happened in Parkland,

160
00:07:07,990 --> 00:00:00,000
was injustice, and injustice
there is injustice here."
