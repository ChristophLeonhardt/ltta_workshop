the USA's constitutionally enshrined love affair with firearms has given it the highest levels of private gun ownership in the world and a truly staggering rate of gun related homicides but it isn't just the US that's felt the effects south of the border in Mexico Americans sourced weapons have played a deadly role in that country's drug wars Julianna Rufus has been to investigate you this is a shooting range in the southern United States here in Texas shooting is a popular and competitive sport okay you ready it's my first time shooting a gun magazine goes in make sure its shoulder correctly it's an assault rifle design for warfare they're sure to shot nine at five o'clock so I would have taken this person out you know she would be dead definitely today an estimated 270 million guns are privately owned in the United States shooting ranges and gun shops are everywhere and the arms industry is a multi-billion dollar business but only a few miles south across the border in Mexico US sauce firearms are having a deadly effect we have come to investigate how Mexican drug cartels exploit weak US gun laws to arm themselves with American weapons our journey begins in a hotel in the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas we have arranged to meet a group of people whose family members have gone missing it's not known whether they are living or dead the presence of drug cartels on the streets makes it too dangerous to meet them in an outside location well nombre de Mika is that indeed an option but the odds of finding a family member alive are low since 2004 well over 150 thousand people have been killed in Mexico's so-called war on drugs here in Tamaulipas the Gulf Cartel and the Los Zetas cartel are in a violent battle over the control of lucrative drug routes civilians are often forced to take sides or end up in the crossfire ie Medicine committee opposition to the current Emily's not was comments so most effective sooner and especially her CV eki Stein los loros hotels pero que I must know Santa Fe many bodies haven't yet been found because it's too dangerous for investigators to search the bodies that do get found end up here at the state attorney general's office in the forensic autopsy center so when did this body arrived it took what one watch a tsunami she broke out for this part of their math well the bullet traveled at such high speed it continued to move once inside the body it was fired from an assault rifle like the ak-47 or ar-15 the cartels favorite weapons faced with such deadly firepower the Mexican police have taken on a paramilitary appearance captain ed Guevara who are OSHA has agreed to show me what his officers have to deal with when battling heavily armed drug cartels we've arrived here at a peak in the violence since April 2017 close to 100 people have been killed in Tamaulipas including several police so they are on high alert is this how you normally travel in a convoy we never know when the streets look deceptively quiet but it's in transit where most attacks occur you can see normal people walking and you never know the impact of the cartels gun battles is clearly visible in residential areas you can see the bullets over there and the walls were but it was a class before the cartels were inside the police arrived and they started a the clash at that time there were like nine people killed the violence has pushed civilians from their homes those are like empty houses empty places were that then they have decided to leave because of the because of the violence they'd rather go to another state of the next guy Republic or the United States nor to keep a better life next that God takes us to the cities jail he wants to show us that the cartels weapons are everywhere barely two months before our visit the jail was home to a massive armed riot it's alleged that the weapons were smuggled in with the help of corrupt prison guards they had laid more than I I will say like a six thousand bullets inside a what weapons did the prisoners have long guns just like this so similar to the tally we could get some guns but fortunately we know that they're mini guns inside that we don't know where they're hey hearing you know during the raid seven people were killed four inmates but also three police officers from Edgar's team Santos wants a car 11 no problem you're saying they still have guns inside oh well but they won't be able to see us right now sir so we control this decide and who controls the other side we also control right now we also control there the other side he's in charge of the controller in our Mexico has very prescriptive gun laws and weapons such as these are only legal in the hands of security forces yet the cartels seem to face no shortage of do you sometimes feel that the cartels the other side is better equipped than you are these weapons have been collected by Mexican security forces from crime scenes the cartels obtain firearms from a number of sources including neighboring countries in China but out of the serial numbers submitted to American authorities for tracing 70% attract purchases from US gun shops to take them out of circulation the tamale past government organizes regular destructions the illegal flow of weapons across the border is a sensitive issue Mexico and the US are heavily invested in trade Victor Manuel sends the governor's chief of staff is in regular talks with his US colleagues and relation con el estado de Texas in particular yo hablo con la bajada Estados Unidos de Samos pedir que phangan mejor atencion altima de las armas overto la venta and specifically in what ways do you think the Americans could tighten their gun legislation to stop the flood of weapons coming across the border obviamente un plan we del desierto say vendor an armed assault o matic 'as case a vendor on sqc Amenti armas para o Deportivo difensa in in la familia / 106 territories a la venta de armas automatic is que se murio resource in 20 we leave to follow the gun smuggling route back north the authorities insists that we travel with an escort as the closer you get to the US the more dangerous it becomes we've just reached a border city of Reynosa and we've been told categorically that we can't film here the cartels are fighting each other and therefore with the security forces and then we reach the calm of the border queues on the other side it's another world here in the city of McAllen it's much more peaceful but suddenly gun stores are common sight there number nearly 5,000 the highest for any American state this is the real deal right here this is a fully automatic ak-47 it looks ugly it sounds ugly and scares people of course this is the gun that most of the bad people in Mexico like male red arrow is a federally licensed firearms or FFL dealer we're here to find out how traffickers managed to purchase weapons in Texan gun stores if somebody comes in and wants to buy a weapon from you what are you required to do by law when you are an FFL dealer you can only sell to people in your state they have to show some kind of proof of ID then you can fill out one of these okay this is called the 4473 and they're gonna ask you are you the actual buyer to the gun they're gonna ask you are you under indictment have you ever been convicted all these kind of questions can they lie yes they can it can lie in the form because buyers must show identification Mexican cartels often commissioned locals to buy weapons on their behalf it's called a straw purchase since 2011 gun dealers must notify the authorities of multiple sales of certain guns it's a regulation introduced by the Obama administration to make it easier to spot straw purchases if you buy rifles that are magazine-fed and above 22 in calibre you have to do a multiple sale for those two but since President Trump selection gun owners think tighter regulation is a thing of the past it's been very very slow I love Donald Trump okay I'll say right now I love Donald Trump but now that Trump won everybody's happy that guns are not gonna go away and no one is buying anything so we're in trouble now we want to hear the traffic aside and a law enforcement officer has put us in touch with a Mexican police informer this man used to work for the Gulf Cartel can you describe to me how the cartels are operating the weapons trafficking from the US and to Mexico is a much more passive person caminando Heelys Armand Vargas is our man Elon Musk London different this Bazaar was a Mexico what about the Mexican security forces do they make a big effort to stop all of this here on the scene Irma Thomas she doesn't point Mariska to Percy was Romero is he not the month was you know manometer not the familiar and US security simply has a different concern as American border forces are more focused on drugs coming in then weapons going out traffickers have adapted their business model oh he used all of us in Norma's poor glory case the motherfucking son official data about trafficking is hard to come by but some US gun sellers have come to attention such as this super store chain called Academy's sports it keeps coming up as a purchasing point of weapons that have been trafficked to Mexico US agencies are limited by law as to what data they can publish but in 2011 a spreadsheet was leaked with thousands of gun tracers an academy sports features very prominently academies sport comes up in nearly 100 tracers some linked to weapons recovered from the Zetas cartel now because the data is a bit old I've also gone through a recent court documents and Academy Sports has come up again as a place where US agencies have mounted an undercover investigation into the illegal sale of firearms Academy's sports didn't respond to our interview requests but has denied any wrongdoing in previous statements adding that they have removed tactical weapons from open display but the federal agency who investigated Academy Sports has agreed to see us hello hi it's called the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms or ATF agents frank ortega and we call strong work on cases that involve firearms trafficking that was seized in a recent investigation this gun was bought by two US citizens on behalf of a Mexican cartel the investigation revealed a whole straw purchasing Network but their charge was based on lying on the paperwork seven of them have been prosecuted in federal court for providing false statements on the fire transaction report so what you're prosecuting them for is the fact that they filled in the form wrongly correct there is currently no firearms trafficking statute that we can prosecute someone for in the absence of a targeted federal law traffickers get off with minimal or no punishment Nicole and Frank take us along the route where weapons are trafficked south there are 52 border crossings between the u.s. and Mexico used by thousands of people every day this one connects Brownsville with the city of Matamoros what we're looking at in terms of rework this is your frontline in spite of a massive drive to increase border security the ATF has seen a series of budget cuts and the number of agents has been substantially reduced President Trump wants to build a wall to keep refugees and migrants out of the you know it states do you think such a wall could ever stop the flood of American weapons going into Mexico that's not the trend that we're currently seeing is they don't focus and then we'll cross firearms by crossing the river they cross them in vehicles through the international bridges what does it take to stop the weapons crossing the border what we could really use is the firearms trafficking statute because that would allow us to go after not only the straw purchaser but the entire network of people that are getting these guns to arm the cartel but some legal gun sales take place virtually outside the law here in Texas so-called private sellers can sell weapons without any background checks many private sellers use specialist websites and I have made contact a former Texan law enforcement officer has agreed to help us since he still does private undercover work we're hiding his face went on to arms list there is actually somebody who is selling a Romanian a que 650 it's got the package it looks new the investigator takes over contact with the seller he will show us how easy it is to buy a weapon completely anonymously so you're texting with Tom now I told him that I was only interested in Romanian really the vendor has at least four other rifles for sale you replied to me he said the mag question mark it is a perfect condition not in a not in a package I will call you and not to set up a meeting place the seller wants to meet at this service station a busy and public place he's waiting with the ak-47 in the boot of his car we record the audio within minutes the deal is done later in a private place we meet to look at the purchase it's an ak-47 the cartels favorite weapon I find that pretty extraordinary I mean this is a weapon that was designed for war and it took you about five minutes to buy it did you add any point of time show identification did he ask anything about your second name know who you were it was just a cell right now was me experience law enforcement it could have been a cartel to make sure the weapon doesn't end up in the wrong hands we decide to destroy it so this Kalashnikov actually broke the machine but as really hot actually really hot but um nobody is gonna shoot this gun again that's for sure so what can American authorities do to keep track of firearms our next stop is a thousand miles north in West Virginia it is here that the Bureau of Tobacco and Firearms traces weapons found at crime scenes including those in Mexico we do trade us source firearms for in 2016 alone the ATF traced nearly 10,000 weapons found in Mexico back to dealers and owners in the US but American law stopped Neel from sharing details instead he takes us on a tour what you'll see are hallways and rows and rows of boxes u.s. laws only allow the agency to keep records from gun dealers who are no longer in business each month the ATF receives around 2 million paper documents we're simply prohibited from creating any kind of a searchable database lying it's just the way the legislation is written even records submitted by dealers in electronic format must be reversion guys here are the immediate conversion group we see the documents in electronic format what we do is take that and making the image so that that's not searchable anymore that means you're taking something that was easily searchable electronically searchable and you're making a search harder yes that's what happens if investigators want to trace a gun from a crime scene in Mexico or the u.s. ATF employees must navigate a mountain of paperwork you life is made so much more difficult but all these laws that restrict how you can actually do your work who's responsible for those laws US Congress is responsible for for any of the laws particularly the federal gun laws and it would be literally an act of Congress if that were to be changed Washington the place to find out who really shapes us gun laws a group of congressmen is bringing a bill which could further limit the ATF ability to investigate trafficking our interview request to them have gone unanswered so we try to find them in person congressman Aaron Jenkins is the sponsor of the proposed new law hi from al-jazeera I'm actually looking for congressman Jenkins his staff say they haven't received our emails and we are sent away we go in search of the co-sponsors of the bill sorry are you working with congressman Massey sorry do you know if congressman heights is around today we have records of our emails but it's the same answer everywhere okay we've put in a few requests we don't always get you know requests sometimes they don't come through to my email inbox like they go to a spam filter right so how as the press do we get in touch with you oh okay but cool we did without results finally we are in luck hi good morning congressman very well thank you we know that you're supporting this bill which cancels the multiple reporting requirement for assault rifles now the ATF is saying that's one of the few tools that they have to stop trafficking and school purchasing can you just tell us why you support this second amendment is very clear limitation on the government's ability to regulate firearms and I think Second Amendment speaks for itself I took an oath when I ran for Congress to preserve protect and defend the Constitution in this bill was one of the ways I'm doing it but it helps to prevent a crime it helps to stop trafficking and straw purchasing congressman Onion interested in stopping crime the Second Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees Americans the right to carry weapons we know the congressman is you at a meeting so we wait again congressman anything else be on the second amendment there is a bill here that's an anti trafficking bill would you vote in favor would you like to have can I show to you okay thank you very much we will do that we called congressman Ferran holds office several times thereafter he never did provide a response but Evan Jenkins the sponsor of the proposed law which would limit the ATF's investigative powers sent a written statement he says he wants to stop government intrusion into the lives of responsible gun owners with President Trump now in power laws that target trafficking have become much less likely to get passed here he is addressing the 2017 convention of the National Rifle Association who contributed over 30 million u.s. dollars to his campaign in the White House no longer will federal agencies be coming after law-abiding gun owners at rallies across the country Trump voters have urged him to construct a war between Mexico and the u.s. a promise president Trump has vowed to deliver that wall is going to help us very importantly with the deadly and heartbreaking consequences of illegal immigration the lost lives the drugs the gangs the cartels the crisis of smuggling and trafficking but do Trump and his supporters connect their freedom to buy guns with the destruction suffered by Mexico's people if America intends to keep drugs and migrants out it should get tougher on weapons going in for now the families of the disappeared are waiting for the violence to end they want to search for their loved ones to finally begin you
