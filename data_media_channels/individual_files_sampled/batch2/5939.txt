and the rewrite tonight is President Trump rewriting his position on guns believe me you put me in there we're going to save that Second Amendment we're going to save your guns they're not gonna take away your bullets they're not gonna shorten up your magazines they're not gonna do anything they're not gonna do anything the presidential candidate who said he would do absolutely nothing about gun laws had a meeting at the White House today about changing gun laws it was a televised Trump meeting with a bipartisan group of senators and congressmen invited to the White House and because it was a trump meeting it was filled with ridiculous trunk moments like when he said he wanted to seize guns from some people before there's any proof that those people should have guns number one you can take the guns away immediately from people that you can a judge easily are mentally ill like this guy you know that the police saw that it was a problem they didn't take any guns away now that could have been policing I think they should have taken him away anyway whether they had the right or not take away the guns everyone in that room Republicans and Democrats knows that the president is an ignoramus they know he does not comprehend a single sentence of the Constitution but none of them tried to correct the President on that point including the Democrats the Democrats acknowledged leaders on gun legislation Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut the Democrats clearly made a calculation before the meeting started to approach the meeting professionally in the hope of actually getting something done any one of the Democrats could have become a big media start tonight by repeatedly explaining to the president how wrong he is how ignorant he is and how much of a problem he and his party have been for gun legislation so every Democrat in the room resisted the urge to attack the president for his own position on gun policy after all previous mass murders because it was a meeting in which there was cause for some hope of strengthening background checks which everyone in the meeting including the president seemed to be in favor of and maybe theirs for something more than that I just like to ask Joe and pattern in your bill what are you doing about the 18 to 21 we didn't change that okay are you gonna leave that to everyone's surprise it was the president who brought up banning the sale of assault weapons to buyers under the age of 21 he said it doesn't make sense to sell assault weapons to people under the age of 21 but he did not say he was actually opposed to it and was going to support legislation outlawing it he mentioned that the NRA is opposed to that kind of legislation but he said quote it's something you have to think about now most Trump watchers are probably betting that the NRA will keep Donald Trump in line and not allow him or the Republicans to do much more than a minor strengthening of background check system if that but Democrats in that room today had a responsibility to spend their time in that room working as legislators and not critics because if they can help push through legislation no matter how minor it is it will be something where previously there has been absolutely nothing and when they finish with that those Democrats can go back to attacking the president for not doing more and go back to trying to do more but today was the day for Democrats to try to soften the ground for compromise and to teach the president things he does not know the assault-weapons legislation this is the number of incidents before and of incidents and of deaths this is when the ten year assault weapon ban was in how incidents and deaths drop when it ended you see it going on the president did declare his support today for a couple of bipartisan Senate bills that strengthen the background check system and that is a huge step for someone who campaigned on the idea of doing absolutely nothing of course we will believe it only when we see him sign the legislation but in the meantime Senate Democrats have to behave as if that is possible that didn't mean giving up on what they really want to achieve and so Senator Dianne Feinstein asked the president to consider her new bill banning assault weapons senator Murphy and 26 of us have co-sponsored a new bill I would be most honored if you would take a look at and we will get it to you and let us know what you what you think of it I will thank you thank you very much certify Stein knows that the president isn't going to support that bill she was just letting him know that if they do legislate something on background checks if they do legislate something to prohibit the sale of bump stocks for converting assault rifles into the equivalent of automatic weapons that she will be back that this is the cause of her life as a senator and a politician since the day she had to announce in San Francisco as a city council member that mayor George Moscone and city council member Harvey Milk had been assassinated because Donald Trump cannot keep track of what people are saying or keep track of what he's in favor of or what he's opposed to there was this moment where he actually appeared to endorse senator Feinstein's bill and suggested combining it with the background checks bills that he is in favor of the enemy cadet if you have also and I think you can into the bill Joe can you throw that fat can you add some of the things you dr.tofu have you helped well no I'll help but can you add what Amy and what Diane have can we add the mint and I know you can add what senator fight sides asking for the president's help because she knows that all successful legislation needs the president's help Dianne Feinstein has been through this before in a similar televised style meeting in the White House she got the president to agree to a standalone daca bill before Republicans in John Kelly pulled Donald Trump away from that Democratic position senator Feinstein is not naive she knows what is likely to happen but she also knows it is a senator's job to never give up to never give up hope that there can be some progress even minor progress even in the age of Trump the job of Senator done well is never easy but in the age of Trump the job of being a Democratic senator has never been more difficult never the easiest thing for Democratic senators to do in the room with the president today would be to attack him to show how much smarter they are than he is but the Democrats didn't do that they chose professionalism over grandstanding in the very slim hope that they might actually get Donald Trump to sign something the slim hope that Donald Trump might force the Republicans in the House and the Senate to take a baby step in the right direction and so Democratic congressman Ted Deutsch who represents parkland Florida where our most recent mass murder took place gave the president a wristband that memorializes the 17 dead and he asked the president for his help getting a bill passed Carson dodged surely has as much doubt about Donald Trump's ability to empathize as the rest of us do but today was the day for Ted Deutsch to try to think of ways to pull Donald Trump in his direction to get the president's signature on legislation for people who hate Donald Trump and wanted to see him attacked by those Democrats today it was probably a difficult meeting to watch but if you know what professionalism looks like in the Senate and in the house you know that what you saw today was Democrats whose oath of office obliges them to never give up hope and so representatives Ted Deutsch Elizabeth Esty and Stephanie Murphy and senators joe Manchin Amy Klobuchar Chris Murphy and Dianne Feinstein went into that meeting today with the political momentum created by the high school kids in parkland Florida to try to get something done for them to try to get something done for the country the kids of Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School haven't given up hope and those House members and those senators haven't given up hope either hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for
