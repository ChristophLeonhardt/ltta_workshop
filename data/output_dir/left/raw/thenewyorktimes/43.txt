1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
“I mean, we knew — they said
that this storm was coming.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,689
But I blew it off,
I swear I did.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,800
I would say, ‘Oh, you know,
we’ve heard this before.’

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,440
And then a tree fell
through my apartment.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,030
So I felt it real stupid
after saying that.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,220
It breaks my heart.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,710
It’s really heartbreaking
because I don’t really

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,940
have a home to go to now.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,830
I have keys
and my rent is paid,

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,840
but I don’t have a home.”

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,780
This is what’s left of
Douglas Smallwood’s home

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,880
after Hurricane Florence

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,900
ripped through Wilmington, N.C.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,370
“So we’ve
come back here.

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,620
You can see that
this tree here,

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,540
it hit the roof
of this building

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,940
and it just plummeted
to my apartment.

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,360
My apartment means
a lot to me

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,910
because I worked
very hard to get it.

20
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,160
You know, I saved
up a lot of money.

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,460
I stayed with my sister
for a little while —

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,250
was prepared to start
a new home.

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,990
I always say, I have
a great apartment.

24
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,060
It’s in the back.

25
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,150
It’s quiet.

26
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,380
But when you’re dealing
with a hurricane,

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,870
I was really concerned
about these trees and —

28
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,880
it’s just real sad.”

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,620
Douglas just moved
into this apartment

30
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,150
two months ago.

31
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,560
When he heard
about the hurricane,

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,600
he quickly evacuated
to his sister’s house

33
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,000
in the northwest of the city.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,340
But he wasn’t the only
one who was hit hard.

35
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,430
The entire city of
Wilmington was affected.

36
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,050
Record rainfall
and wind damage

37
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,180
downed trees and
flooded neighborhoods,

38
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,490
isolating many of Wilmington’s
roughly 119,000 residents.

39
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,260
Local and
out-of-state firefighters

40
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,930
rushed to rescue more
than 450 stranded people

41
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,240
from flash floods here.

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,640
The waters have now
receded, but there are still

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,710
more flash flood warnings,
and the river

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,870
may crest again.

45
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,870
“We’ve got a lot of trees

46
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,760
that are down
on houses,

47
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,180
around their driveways.

48
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,600
We can also tell where
there’s been

49
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,630
quite a bit of flooding
up into the yards

50
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,120
and even up to the houses.

51
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,330
A lot of these areas where
we’re pulling people out of,

52
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,480
they’ve lived there
for 20, 25 years.

53
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,389
They’ve never
seen it that high —

54
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,440
and they were always told it
would never get that high there,

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,470
but obviously it did.”

56
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,800
And even as the sun started to
peek back in the coastal city,

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,870
thousands of people
are still without power

58
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,420
or stranded by floodwaters.

59
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,460
For residents like Douglas,
that means cleanup

60
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,070
won’t begin for another few days.

61
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,630
“When you actually
see the damage

62
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,710
that’s done to the inside,
it’s mind-boggling.

63
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,420
Oh, the tree’s right there.

64
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,740
That’s the tree, right there.

65
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,860
So it fell in, right here
on top,

66
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:48,840
caved the window structure in,
completely broke it.”

67
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,280
For now, without
renter’s insurance

68
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,750
and more flood warnings
on the way, the hard work

69
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,730
for Douglas is just beginning.

70
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,160
“And nothing else in here
really I want to look at.

71
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,130
This is all just demolished —

72
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,200
all of my picture frames.

73
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,680
So, farewell apartment.

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,990
I’ll see ya.

75
00:03:06,990 --> 00:00:00,000
I probably won’t be back
in here no time soon.”
