stubs happening at the Olympics primarily people are winning medals we all know this however doping has been one of the bigger topics in past Olympics and this year Russia specifically has been penalized for past doping scandals so as a result Russian athletes are not allowed to fly the Russian flag their flag isn't shown in any of the Olympic imagery and you would think that some of these Russian athletes would be a little more careful with their doping this time around but so far two Russian athletes have tested positive for doping first there was a Russian curler who posts who tested positive and then the more recent case is the one that I particularly enjoy she is a Russian bobsledder her name is nadezhda serge Eva and she wore this wonderful shirt that says I don't do doping but then she tested positive for doping oops Russian bobsled Federation president Alexander Zhukov announced that she tested positive for a banned heart medication known as trimet the seen and that's not good so she does do doping she apparently likes the doping she she denies that she ever even took the medication but again she tested positive for it so I don't know what's going on there and the Russian bobsled Federation president announced it but nonetheless Trump denies it he says she strongly denies it she strongly denies it so there's so there must not be any I feel like the story's overblown no no it's it's just a fun little story but you can write like those poor Russians what do I I can't believe they're doing this to them anyway usually when people say I don't do doping they probably are it's like I feel like she thought that that shirt would protect her like if I just wear a shirt that says I don't do doping then no one will think that I'm doping I mean that is a classic case of I don't know if it's projection but it's a it says oldest Shakespeare methinks the lady doth protest too much right and and it's the same thing that trumped of a very stable genius wait was anybody questioning your stability I actually kind of that's and you're insecure about it that's why you're screaming on Twitter that you're a very stable genes I'm gonna get a shirt that says I don't fornicate well I might send the wrong message I have big hands so one more thing I disagree with you Anna on this very important story I think the funnier one is the Russian curler who did doping why what doping do you need like aggressively swept your home I never aggressively sweep without taking without doping I do I feel like you know if I really wanted to enhance my performance and sweeping my home I would take heart medication stop sweeping when my kids got in middle school but it was pretty hard work back in the day but there are so many jokes online on my Facebook page from other comedians about curlers I think they made me cry laughing it was just like it's come on man I mean if you do competitive weightlifting you're doing curling like this okay fine I get the doping but curly I know I know to us it looks silly but it's still an athletic thing to do and it's hot it's not easy I bet if you were up against other curlers you would really struggle yeah you know what make me like I can't I'm sure I couldn't make the American curling team but like don't make me go back to Turkey and become a Turkish Olympic curler the league where we're gonna find ice for you and those of you snarky self-righteous people that are like you're making fun of somebody who's in the Olympics I'm not making fun of somebody who worked really hard to get to the Olympics in a sport that they and respect I'm talking about somebody who took medication to beat somebody else at a sport that looks like sweeping the floor if you liked this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
