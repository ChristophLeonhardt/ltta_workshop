1
00:00:00,157 --> 00:00:02,559
IT WAS ONLY THERE TO SPY FOR

2
00:00:02,559 --> 00:00:04,161
POLITICAL REASONS AND TO HELP

3
00:00:04,161 --> 00:00:05,529
CRICKET HILLARY WHEN THAT, JUST

4
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:07,764
LIKE THEY DID TO BERNIE SANDERS,

5
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:09,099
WHO GOT DUPED.

6
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:09,733
CONGRESSMAN ANDY BIGS FROM

7
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:10,600
ARIZONA IS ONE OF THE HOUSE

8
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,203
REPUBLICANS CALLING FOR A SECOND

9
00:00:13,203 --> 00:00:15,138
SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE

10
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:16,340
THE FBI AND DOJ POSSIBLE

11
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:16,740
MISCONDUCT.

12
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,974
HE JOINS US NOW LIVE.

13
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:18,975
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US

14
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:19,543
TONIGHT.

15
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:20,577
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

16
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:22,179
>> Shannon: YOU PUT TOGETHER A

17
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:23,947
LENGTHY REVOLUTION WHICH I HAVE

18
00:00:23,947 --> 00:00:24,581
READ AND FOLKS CAN FIND IT

19
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:27,050
ONLINE, I THINK THEY WOULD FIND

20
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,851
IT INTERESTING TO GO THROUGH THE

21
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:28,652
FACTS YOU OUTLINED TO NOT ONLY

22
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:30,687
THE HILLARY CLINTON

23
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:32,155
INVESTIGATION BUT YOU MENTION

24
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:33,957
URANIUM ONE, THE CLINTON

25
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:34,658
FOUNDATION, HOW WILL THOSE

26
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:35,792
THINGS WERE ALL HANDLED.

27
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:37,527
AN INVESTIGATION TO

28
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:39,996
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE FISA

29
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:40,364
WARRANT.

30
00:00:40,364 --> 00:00:41,631
WRAP IT ALL UP BY SAYING IT

31
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:42,265
WARRANTS A SECOND SPECIAL

32
00:00:42,265 --> 00:00:42,599
COUNSEL.

33
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:44,568
ARE YOU GOING TO GET ONE?

34
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:46,570
>> I HOPE WE WILL.

35
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,771
THE PRESIDENT HAS ASKED FOR ONE.

36
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:49,272
BESIDES HIM, WE HAVE BEEN ASKING

37
00:00:49,272 --> 00:00:51,408
FOR TEN MONTHS.

38
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:52,576
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIAL

39
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:55,345
COMMITTEE, TREY GOWDY.

40
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:56,079
TWO MEMBERS OF OUR LEADERSHIP,

41
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,550
THE MAJORITY LEADER, KEVIN

42
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,352
McCARTHY, STEVE SCALISE, THE

43
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:02,786
MAJORITY WHIP.

44
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:04,554
EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE GETTING ON

45
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:05,889
THIS AND IT HAS TAKEN TEN

46
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:06,223
MONTHS.

47
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:07,257
SOME OF US GOT ON A LITTLE EARLY

48
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:09,459
BUT WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT

49
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:12,429
THIS UNRAVELS, IT'S LIKE IT

50
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:13,029
CHINESE GRIP TORTURE.

51
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:14,164
YOU FEEL IT AND WE ARE SEEING

52
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:16,566
SOMETHING NEW ALMOST EVERY WEEK

53
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:17,734
INCLUDING NOW THE SPYING AND

54
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:18,769
THAT TYPE OF THING.

55
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:19,903
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM

56
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:20,670
OF THIS.

57
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,973
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T TRUST

58
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:24,141
US ANYMORE.

59
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:25,742
MOST PEOPLE NOW BELIEVE IT WAS

60
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:26,543
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, AS I HAVE

61
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:28,345
FELT FROM THE BEGINNING.

62
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:29,479
THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE SPECIAL

63
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,348
COUNSEL APPOINTED.

64
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:32,082
>> Shannon: THIS THURSDAY WE

65
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:33,950
ARE TOLD THERE'S GOING TO BE A

66
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,552
MEETING THAT WILL INVOLVE SEVEN

67
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:36,553
DIFFERENT PLAYERS.

68
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:37,687
CHAIRMAN NUNES AND GERMAN GOT IT

69
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:38,555
WILL BE INVOLVED WE UNDERSTAND

70
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:40,557
ALONG WITH OFFICIALS FROM THE

71
00:01:40,557 --> 00:01:40,824
DOJ.

72
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:41,992
AND OTHERS WHO WILL GET TOGETHER

73
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:45,128
AND LOOK AT THIS INFORMATION

74
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:46,129
WITH RESPECT TO THE SOURCE FOR

75
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:47,931
THIS INDIVIDUAL OR THIS

76
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:48,298
INFORMANT.

77
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:50,534
HERE IS WHAT SENATE MINORITY

78
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:51,234
LEADER DEMOCRAT CHUCK SCHUMER

79
00:01:51,234 --> 00:01:51,935
HAD TO SAY TODAY ABOUT THOSE

80
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:54,004
KINDS OF MEETINGS.

81
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:58,141
>> A MAN LIKE DEVIN NUNES, WHO I

82
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,242
HEAR PRIVATELY FOR MY REPUBLICAN

83
00:01:59,242 --> 00:02:00,010
COLLEAGUES, THEY THINK HE'S OFF

84
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,312
THE DEEP END AND HE'S GOING TO

85
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:04,548
GET HOLD OF THIS?

86
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:05,882
AND WE THINK THAT'S FOR FAIR

87
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:07,117
UNBIASED OVERSIGHT?

88
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:11,354
GIVE ME A BREAK.

89
00:02:11,354 --> 00:02:13,156
IF SUCH A MEETING OCCURS, AND I

90
00:02:13,156 --> 00:02:15,492
DON'T BELIEVE IT SHOULD, BUT IF

91
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:18,929
IT OCCURS, IT MUST BE BIPARTISAN

92
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:19,830
IT OCCURS, IT MUST BE BIPARTISA

93
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,230
BIPARTISAN.

94
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,931
>> Shannon: WOULD YOU BE FOR

95
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:21,698
DEMOCRATS ATTENDING THAT MEETING

96
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:23,366
ON THURSDAY?

97
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:24,201
>> I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED

98
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:25,101
ABOUT DEMOCRATS GETTING IN THERE

99
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:25,535
TO BEGIN WITH.

100
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:27,504
FIRST OF ALL DEVON HAS TO SEE

101
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:29,072
WHAT'S GOING ON AND WE DON'T

102
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:31,174
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME

103
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:31,575
WITH.

104
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:32,676
THEY HAVE TOLD US TIME AND TIME

105
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:33,944
AGAIN WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU

106
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:34,778
SOMETHING AND THEN IT TURNS OUT

107
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:36,546
THEY WILL JUST SAY IT CONTAINS

108
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:38,048
THIS CORE CONTAINS THAT, OR THEY

109
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:38,748
GIVE US SOMETHING HEAVILY

110
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:40,951
REDACTED THAT DOESN'T MEAN

111
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:42,352
ANYTHING.

112
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:43,119
SO I THINK THAT THE DEMOCRATS

113
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,588
ARE IN THE DEEP END ON THIS ONE,

114
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:46,590
NOT DEVIN NUNES.

115
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,191
AND IF DEVIN FINDS THAT THERE

116
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:48,992
SOMETHING WARRANTED I HAVE NO

117
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:51,228
DOUBT THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL BE

118
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:52,629
INVOLVED AND BEGIN ON THE SAME

119
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:53,029
INFORMATION.

120
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:53,763
THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY GOING

121
00:02:53,763 --> 00:02:55,832
TO MAKE IT?

122
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:56,533
THEY'VE DONE SO IN THE PAST.

123
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:57,534
>> Shannon: YOU KNOW THEY

124
00:02:57,534 --> 00:02:58,969
WOULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT

125
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:01,338
THE REPUBLICANS, ESPECIALLY

126
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:03,406
ABOUT CHAIRMAN NUNES.

127
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:04,708
PLENTY OF LEAKS AROUND

128
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:09,279
WASHINGTON.

129
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,747
CONGRESSMAN SAYS THIS TODAY.

130
00:03:10,747 --> 00:03:11,715
WHEN THEIR CONSPIRACY THEORIES

131
00:03:11,715 --> 00:03:13,350
FALL APART THEY HAVE NO PLACE

132
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,384
ELSE TO TURN.

133
00:03:14,384 --> 00:03:15,785
THIS HAS BEEN THE MAJORITY'S GO

134
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:16,453
TO MOVE.

135
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:18,288
THIS RESOLUTION SHOWS A PROFOUND

136
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:19,022
MISUNDERSTANDING OF OUR CRIMINAL

137
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:19,990
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

138
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,958
YOU ARE A LAWYER.

139
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:22,993
IS THIS A PROFOUND

140
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:23,927
MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE CRIMINAL

141
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:24,394
JUSTICE SYSTEM?

142
00:03:24,394 --> 00:03:27,230
>> I JUST HEARD HIM SAY

143
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,265
YESTERDAY THAT MR. MUELLER IS A

144
00:03:28,265 --> 00:03:29,165
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.

145
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:29,966
THAT INDICATES THAT HE DOESN'T

146
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:33,136
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

147
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:33,970
MR. MUELLER IS NOT A SPECIAL

148
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,371
PROSECUTOR.

149
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:36,373
HE IS A SPECIAL COUNSEL.

150
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:37,774
HE IS APPOINTED AND HE'S GIVEN

151
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:38,241
SOME AUTHORITY.

152
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:38,842
IT'S LIMITED IN SCOPE.

153
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:40,577
THEY WILL TELL US WHAT'S IN THE

154
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:41,344
SCOPE.

155
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:42,178
THEY HAVE REDACTED THAT.

156
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,547
BUT WHAT THEY'VE DONE TODAY AS

157
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:44,214
THEY'VE ACTUALLY GONE AND

158
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:46,550
INSTEAD WE ARE NOT YOUR SPECIAL

159
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,685
COUNSEL, WE ARE EMPLOYEES OF THE

160
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:50,720
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, THE

161
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,189
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND GIVE

162
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:54,691
US SPECIAL PROSECUTOR STATUS,

163
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:55,659
AND WHY IS THAT?

164
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,160
IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO

165
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,361
BE LIMITED IN SCOPE TO WHAT THEY

166
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,597
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE, AND THAT IS

167
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:01,464
WAS THEIR LESSON COLLUSION TO

168
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:02,799
INFLUENCE THE ELECTION.

169
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,269
THEY ARE WAY BEYOND THAT AND HE

170
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:06,736
KNOWS THAT.

171
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:08,104
>> Shannon: A FEDERAL JUDGE

172
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:10,140
NOW HAS THAT SCOPE MEMO ON

173
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,507
REDACTED.

174
00:04:10,507 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WILL WATCH AND SEE IF YOU AS
