Vatican Catholic Church scandal and we'll see there are going to be new things that come out but I want to give you the basic outlook because the mainstream media are lying about this first of all there are very few things that are unprecedented in the history of the Catholic Church you know there have been multiple Empires Pope's being kidnapped by tyrants and invaders and this and then this is unprecedented a top Vatican official is accusing the Pope of covering up for an abusive priests and he's calling on that pope to resign this is utterly unprecedented and this poses serious questions not only for Francis's pontificate but for the state of Western Christianity and Western civilization I this the significance of this letter that came out from the Vatican's former representative to Washington at 11 page letter outlining all of this it cannot be overstated how significant this is so let's get through it very quickly because then we got to talk about election fraud and how the left is gonna steal the next election the the Cardinal to write this testimony is the former nun CEO to Washington - the Vatican's representative to the United States for some context the United States and Germany basically funds the Catholic Church and so this is the Vatican's rep to the United States that that's what the word nuncio means some people are pronouncing at Nunzio Nunzio is the name of my Italian uncle who lives in the Bronx nun Co is the the representative to the United States his name is Carlo Maria Vigano in his 11 page testimony he outlines abuse and he names names specifically we saw a guy named Cardinal McCarrick step down he was the first guy to step down from the College of Cardinals in almost a hundred years he stepped down just a couple of weeks ago amid allegations of abusing not only minors but a lot of seminarians and a lot of priests I've talked to priests friends about this I've talked to sources about this they say this was widely known not that he was abusing kids but that he was abusing seminarians and priests and was allowed to persist by bishops who were covering it up including his successors including his pals in the Catholic clergy including Cardinal Wuerl by the way so this is from this testimony which outlines all of the abuse quote Cardinal Wuerl well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed imposed on him by Pope Benedict transgressing the Pope's order also allowed him to reside at a Seminary in Washington DC in doing so he put other seminarians at risk so one thing that's being really misrepresented here in the mainstream media I think the Washington Post did this is they said that the according to this testimony both Pope Benedict and Pope Francis both of them knew about the abuse of Cardinal McCarrick and that's technically true what what is left out here the lie of omission is that Pope Benedict punished Cardinal McCarrick he sent this bad abusive Cardinal who abused a lot of priests and and some minors he sent him to into seclusion he you know put Benedict to defrocked a number of abusive priests pelea sized them took them out of the clergy and he said mckarrick has did not appear in public he can't live in the seminaries he needs to be punished well these things are being investigated when Pope Francis came to power he reinstated McCarrick he gave him all of his old privileges back and the Cardinal who replaced him allowed him to live at the seminaries where he had been abusing priests before this is high corruption rank corruption if this was reported also directly to Francis so the author of this testimony is saying I spoke to Francis directly I know that Francis knows about this I told it to him with my own lips so but one example here is this guy vegan oh it was speaking to Francis and Pope Francis apparently asked him what do you know about Cardinal carick vegan Oh said there's a dossier this thick on Cardinal McCarrick outlining his abuse of priests and seminarians again not not little boys but of other people in the clergy this big and you should know about that and when he left he later found out according to this testimony that Pope Francis knew McCarrick had spoken previously to mckarrick and perhaps was just trying to suss out what vegan Oh thought about mckarrick in order to figure out who to promote and who to demote but we do know that Francis ripp empowered McCarrick he let him go to China as a representative of the Vatican you let him go all over lemon seminaries and basically have free rein in the exact opposite of what Pope Benedict allowed him to do so the the issue here is that Pope Francis won't respond at the end of this papal of this testimony from Cardinal vegan oh he says the Pope should resign the Pope knew the Pope should resign and this is not some power play here because the Cardinal who wrote this is retired it's not he doesn't have anything personally to gain from this and he's been a top-level official for a long time including under Pope Francis and he just is a credible guy according to all of the other sources so what does Francis say to this nothing nothing he was asked by the press what he's going to say and respond to these calls for resignation unprecedented in the history of the church and Francis responds quote I read that statement this morning I read it and I will say sincerely and that I must say this to you and all of you who are interested read the document carefully and judge it for yourselves I will not say one word on this I think the statement speaks for itself and you have sufficient journalistic capacity to reach your own conclusions are you kidding me or are you kidding me this is utterly unacceptable these are serious allegations but made by a very serious person and he says posh pish posh I don't owe you an explanation no thanks and this is very much in keeping with the Francis pontificate he has done this time and again the theological undercurrent which is not really being reported on is that as Pope Francis has said things that seem to be in direct contradiction to 2,000 years of church doctrine there have been there were four including the considered conservative Cardinal Cardinal Raymond Burke who sent what are called a Dubya to Pope Francis five questions about statements he's made to clarify what he's saying and make sure that he's not promoting heresy again a serious document given respectfully hand-delivered to the papal residence Francis said I'm not going to respond wouldn't respond to this day does not respond in fact that those Dubya were only published two months after Francis refused to admit that he received them just know he just will not answer his critics this is very much in keeping and another aspect of the Francis pontificate is he has seemed to dismiss if not denigrate younger Catholics who are more serious about orthodoxy and more serious about traditional liturgies than he is he's denigrated them he says they're too rigid oh don't be too rigid why are you young people too rigid just dismissing and dismissing and dismissing them you know one wonders if Pope Francis will take his own advice here because he's called for transparency constantly we need transparency we need the end of clericalism he's always blaming this abuse on clericalism well clericalism referring to all of these corrupt bishops and taking their their offices you know and making idols of their offices and abusing their offices one wonders if he'll take this seriously - do we need transparency do we do we need are we going to have transparency from Pope Francis are we going to have an end to clericalism I don't know more on that in a second a lot of other people are implicated in this a lot of other Americans are implicated in this testimony one of whom is Cardinal cubish Cardinal cubish is Cardinal in Chicago he was he was appointed by mckarrick and Worrell to other guys who have been seriously corrupted who we know have been corrupted he was appointed apparently because of their influence another little bit for those of you who are not in the Catholic no Cardinal cubish is referred to in some quarters as Cardinal cupcake by by more conservative I certainly I wouldn't use that phrase it's so uncharitable but they do call him Cardinal cupcake and so anyway Cardinal cubish then responds to these allegations against him he said quote the former nun CEO is confused about the sequence of events this is astonishing Pope Francis has made it clear he wants pastoral bishops and I work each day to live up to that expectation in collaboration bla bla bla bla bla he just refused to do it and he says the annunzio is confused the new NCO doesn't seem to be confused if anybody is confused its Cardinal cubish who is time and time again confused Catholic doctrine and confused people by playing politics by leaning toward left ISM and by playing the press he you know he called for absolute clarity these are the words of Cardinal cubish absolute clarity that he would ban guns from churches and parishes well he's Archbishop but then he's a little less clear on other aspects when he was the Bishop of Rapid City he was less clear on abortion he said well you know we have to consider both sides and when there was an anti-abortion bill up to the legislature well we have to I don't know it's not that clear you know bla bla bla know it that are you kidding me that's a very very clear when he was the when he was the Bishop of Spokane he clearly prohibited the traditional liturgy traditional liturgical books he also was very clear when he said that priests and seminarians shouldn't protest against Planned Parenthood oh he's very clear about that but now he he seems very confused about things that matter he seems very confused he is unclear about same-sex marriage you saw well you know do it to do to do very very unclear I hope we get a little clarity because these people who seem to call for clarity all all the way up the Vatican hierarchy then seem to be very unclear when the light shines on them they seem to be a little unclear on doctrine too so I I hope this is a moment this has been a very challenging pontificate for the church because there have been so many confusing statements so many statements that seem to contradict Catholic doctrine and apparently now so many cover-ups of abuse so many cover-ups if you have to pontificates you have Pope Benedict responding to an abusive priests by punishing him well while he's being investigated and you have a nut in the next pope essentially promoting him those are two very different views and to stand there and say we need more transparency more or less clericalism or honesty while you're covering that up raises serious serious questions of integrity so the question is what to do because we've got to get to our interview but I know people are gonna be wondering not just Catholics but Christians generally what do we do about this the first answer is don't flee the church the church has been through a lot of bad things before a lot of speaking even to the Protestant denominations they've been through a lot of scandals before the answer isn't to leave the church you know whenever there's a big issue in politics or in the church I've noticed this week after week very often the reading from Scripture that week speaks directly to it call it Providence call it coincidence what have you this week on Sunday it was a reading from I think it's John 6 which is right after the Bread of Life sermon Christ says I'm the bread of life this is a hard saying you have to eat my flesh and drink my blood and he says to the disciples people leave him it's too it's too hard for them to hear this and he says will you leave too and Peter responds and says to whom shall we go to whom shall we go say will you leave the church now because of all these scandals will you leave this church or that church to whom shall we go to whom shall we go there's no this is if if this is the truth and we have to follow this we have to look toward Jesus you know in this actually another reading this week was from Ephesians and it was the reading now you know these days in some of the more liberal Catholic liturgies they omit the part about wives submitting to their husbands and they only include the part about husbands loving their wives the the reading says wives submit to your husband's husbands love your wives and you'll see in brackets on the first part now they'll say you don't have to read this no you don't know that's a little it might be a little touchy yeah it's a little touchy these are hard sayings but it you know the church is the Bride of Christ Christ is the bridegroom and an issue here if Francis wants to talk about clericalism is that people are not looking to their to their husband which is Christ they certainly need to do that what can you do in very practical terms you can vote with your wallet if you're a Catholic don't give to bishops collections the bishops appeal Catholic Relief Services organizations that are tied to the u.s. Council of caf Bishop's I once had a priest say to me that he liked my book reasons to vote for Democrats a comprehensive guide completely blank he said he was considering one called reasons to listen to the u.s. Council of Catholic Bishops so that's one ways you can vote with your wallet and I recommend you do the question that everyone's asking is should Francis resign the top diplomat Vatican's diplomat to the United States is calling on him to resign we need to find out if his testimony is true it's been corroborated by other people by other high-ranking Vatican officials who have said quote vegan oh is telling the truth that's all I'm going to say that seems true there is some precedence here where Francis said Pope Francis said in May that bishops should retire they shouldn't die in office including the Pope this was kind of a shock it seemed to that he might he might give up the pontificate willingly Pope Benedict did that before him he resigned the papacy under what circumstances were not sure but he did retire and so using Francis's own logic perhaps he should listen to his own words if it comes to that if these allegations are true if Francis really believes that the Pope can retire and should retire if he supports transparency if he supports an end to clericalism then this this will be very important I know I really wanted to go through this because I know to two Outsiders and even to Catholics the details of the Catholic Church and the Vatican and Catholic hierarchy are a little murky and a little strange and seem like they're out of you know the 7th century or something because often they are but the this event is earth-shattering I mean this is if I weren't told by Scripture that the church will exist until the end of the world I would I would be raising an eyebrow right now but the church will endure until the end of the world and if the church is the church the church will endure until the end of the world and we're going through a very very rocky period don't let anybody tell you that this is some minor question the Pope could resign over this and we'll see if that happens ok speaking of spiritual wickedness in high places let's talk about corruption in bureaucracies I spoke with Eric Eggers a terrific guy and the author of fraud had the left plans to steal the next election where he goes oh through all of the history of voter fraud and now we're told all the time by the left there's no such thing as voter fraud it's not real bla bla bla bla bla he lays it out this is an excellent book and here is what Eric has to say about how the left is gonna try to steal the midterms in 2020 Eric thank you so much for being here great Michael I'm glad to be here I loved this book I highly recommend that everybody reads it before Election Day and the midterms and 2020 and every other election because you know the Democrats like to vote early and vote often and what's shocking to me about this whole situation we're in is the Democrats say there is no election fraud it never happens we never try to steal elections and if you pass any laws to stop us we're gonna murder you we're gonna go in and kill you guys how extensive is this problem in reality well I think all you have to do is take a look at the reaction anyone guess anytime they suggest that voter fraud might be a problem as you noted you know I do steer a little clear of accusing anyone of outright murder in the book although that was that was an editorial decision you know at the end but at the end of the day know the stakes are very serious I mean it's it's not actual murder but it might as well be a professional murder because if you do do anything that might try to make elections more secure at the least you're gonna be called a racist and at the worst you'll be subject to never any lawsuits by Soros and DNC funded Hydra so it's an incredibly pervasive problem so like how widespread is it well how vigorous is the protestation and the effort to stop anyone from trying to do it look at what happened to Ohio recently you're still having a contested election there and imagine what would happen if the state of Ohio had been unsuccessful in its efforts to fight Soros funded efforts to do two things right make elections more secure by removing illegal voters from the voting rolls and requiring people to show a voter ID both those things are common sense if they had to fight for as many people every turn that's right and you know I want to go back to the racism accusation because this is what we hear we hear if you want to have voter ID laws you want people to show the same idea that they need to get a pack of cigarettes when they go vote that that's racist somehow it dis franchises black voters or something but you cite specific instances in the book did show that this is not true that these laws are not unpopular with minority voters and that it doesn't suppress the minority vote yet for whatever reason it's not considered racist to suggest that there's entire classes of people that are incapable of doing things that other classes of people are doing you know Michael if you wanted to buy an alcoholic beverage if you want to get on an airplane if you wanted to go to the Democratic National Convention and 26 you didn't needed you needed a driver's license I guess they're racist so no I mean in state of Alabama they passed the voter ID law before the recent election when Roy Moore was on the ballot they saw an increase in minority turnout the state of Ohio instead of Georgia I've seen similar things so the reality is there is no evidence to suggest that requiring an ID in any way suppresses or oppresses menorah turnout the Washington Post did their best to suggest that that was the case but they were actually rebuked very quickly after they published a study by academics from Ivy League institutions though there is no evidence to support it and in fact we've seen the opposite out that's right I think in the New York Times actually even admitted they said you know this surge in minority voting in Alabama does throw a wrench in our narrative basically and it's so absurd it's basically saying it's it's always white liberals and they're saying oh no no we black people can't get IDs we can't they can't we can't expect them to do that as though it's like another species of people black people are they're smart they're just as smart as you are they can go down and get their own ID and go you know buy a pack of cigarettes or a drink or vote or god forbid go to the Democrat National Convention and also the these voter ID laws are not unpopular with minority voters isn't that right no that's right the majority of people don't think that there's anything wrong with requiring that they should have to show an ID yeah I think this myth of voter ID being oppressive it's like the equivalent of you know kind of claiming the wrong height on your driver's license like I wish I was six feet tall but there's just no evidence that supported that's right so this it's exactly the same case with with anybody to claim that voter ID laws are unpopular or oppressive so the Democrats deny that voter fraud happens even though we've uncovered these these instances there was that precinct several precincts I think in Philadelphia in 2012 that recorded zero votes for Mitt Romney you've got other pretty dodgy instances of thousands of absentee ballots being written in the same hand showing up last-minute in races that are decided by a few hundred votes possibly so the people who deny that voter fraud happens now what did they say about all the past examples because you you take us in the book through this great journey of all of the wonderful methods and instances of voter fraud going back to America's earliest days thank you it's like the Oregon Trail and voter fraud and got the blurb I'm gonna tribute to you from my website no I think that there's a key thing you're touching on right and that's this that the left which is the Brennan Center and other Thoros funded groups they define voter fraud in very specific terms and they define it in what's called no an under inclusive way and so they define it only as an act of intentional impersonation on behalf of an illegal voter right who's impersonating a legal voter and there's evidence to say that that's actually quite easy to do but but the two instances that you just referenced the thanks to the 18 precincts in Philadelphia in which Mitt Romney received zero votes in the 2012 election which is a statistical anomaly it's impossible for that to happen even just through sheer error or the hundreds of ballots that had the same signatures actually hundreds of ballot request forms in which the supervisor of elections in South Florida was basically powerless and had to spend the ballots out for them Wow those are both actually those are actually both things that are legal and so they don't qualify or classify as voter fraud and and I think that really touches on an important point either what the Left considers to be voter fraud is that very narrow definition that I shared but what I think you or I or the majority of people that are watching this podcast or even just common sense Americans they would define voter fraud as anything that robs the true weight of an honest American vote and the the real crime of it is not and I try to lay this out in the book is that a vast majority those things are legal and so that's why these two sides were to speak past each other the Left says Oh voter fraud is very rare because they defined it so narrowly and the right would say well voter fraud is actually quite pervasive and and they're right because things that most people would consider to be a voter fraud does happen I mean I we talk about this in the book as well in a GI the Government Accountability Institute or whom I work we commissioned a study as part of the process of this book and we said all right let's take a look at actual ballots cast in the 2016 election we compiled all the publicly available voter rolls we could get we have 2,100 instances of double voting in the state of Florida alone I mean somebody kept you know 2,100 people cast the ballot in the state of Florida where I live and then cast the second ballot somewhere else so that's illegal but the left wouldn't consider that to be voter fraud there's nearly three million people by the way that are registered to vote in more than one state in this country up to 24 million voter registrations are highly inaccurate or completely wrong Supreme Court cited those stats recently so we've got major problems in the system right there's a million illegal immigrants to have driver's license in California there's 248 counties in this country with more registered voters than citizen to legal voting age so it's not a question of is the system flawed the left just tries to couch and get very cute in terms of well does that mean is it actual this impersonation and most people say listen where there's opportunities for fraud or where the errors occur and we know that there's errors all over of course and you see I mean there are so many instances now especially these motor voter laws where you can illegally register to vote and then legally vote right you're it's you should have never have been registered to vote in the first place but once you're registered then then you're registered then you can show up to the polls and vote or you can do it by absentee or whatever it's so you know the left wants to pretend that we've got that we're talking about when people break into an election place and go and stand in line there's so many other ways to do it you talk about 20 20 200 votes in Florida that could have thrown the 2000 presidential election multiple times several times over and and a lot of times by the way people might not know that they're ineligible to vote you talked about this in the book yeah it's a key point and this is another area where I think the left says one thing and it's sort of beggars belief like yeah they're right that there aren't millions of illegal immigrants like getting a bat signal somewhere from George Soros and running to the poll the Soros scandal true like I'm willing to admit that right but but it's absolutely true is that the vulnerability that the left fights to protect like every time they fight against the voter ID law for every time they fight to try to keep the voter rolls from having illegal voters removed they actually end up exploiting the population that they would claim to be wanting to protect it was actually leftist immigration attorneys that turned me on to this as part of the research for the book and I talked about several examples in the book of people that are you know these are non-citizens even in some instances work for polling places but they don't know that they're not supposed to be voting and the law prevents the DMV officials who is the only safeguard between the non citizen and the voter rolls that not the DMV officials not allowed to give any guidance and say well are you a citizen are you not a citizen you've got people whose command of English isn't terrific their command of civics probably could use a bit of scrubbing and so you get these people that they get up on the roll and then you've got and then so now they're a registered voter whether or not whether it should be voting or not and they shouldn't be and that's actually a crime for them to be a registered voter and then them registering to vote actually precludes them from ever becoming a naturalized citizen and in some cases may cause them to face deportation but then what's on the voter rolls now they're a target for these groups of politically motivated tourists funded people they're called bullet arrows in South Florida or politically rose and Texas and there's people that they get told that they should sell their vote and they say well I guess this is how it's done because in some cases they may come from countries in which that is the way it's done and and so absolutely you've got numerous examples of non-citizens they didn't realize they were violating the law and now we're caught up as the victims of an incredibly vulnerable electoral system that's right and to say nothing of another aspect that's built into this which is the census you know representation in Congress is based on the population of the state not the legal population of the state so already illegal aliens in the country or skewing the American electorate in the American vote just just by their virtue of being counted in the US Census yeah believe it's five electoral votes are considered to be given to non-citizens in California which basically makes non-citizens the equivalent of at least fourteen states from an electoral math standpoint and you know the tail on this there's two things like one you're absolutely right and the second piece of it is is that as we know Tom Perez in the head of the Democratic National Committee their whole goal is to expand non citizen voting rights and that's the thing could tell metell on this was when there was all this discussion about the census and whether or not we should include this question of non citizenship on the census what happened you saw Tom Perez invoke voter intimidation and violating the Voting Rights Act well what is inquiring about somebody's citizenship have to do with violating the Voting Rights Act and it's because and we seen this in San Francisco where illegal immigrants are now able to cast ballots in local and municipal elections Tom Perez to work for a group that is also on the tail end of responding called Casa de Maryland like an acorn and the Raza type group in the state of Maryland and their big push was to advocate for non citizen voting right Tom Perez his hometown if the Coma Park Maryland has been allowing voting right since 1992 for non citizens so it's sort of insane that was actually one of the things I was most floored by when I wrote the book it sounds like wow I I didn't realize non-citizens were able to legally cast ballots in this country I think luckily they're not able to cast ballots in federal elections but for the first time Democrats and you know Democrats believe that illegal immigrants who pay taxes should be able to vote in election right a majority of Democrats 53% of self-described liberal 54 percent of Democrats believe illegal aliens who pay taxes should be able to vote though this is clearly the future and yes it's only a matter of time before we start arguing about well why can't non citizen to vote in federal elections that's right it's a shocking number and of course you know the minute that anybody who happens to be here gets to vote then the whole idea of a nation disappears which is Soros's goal and you know I I think sometimes people even on the right but certainly people on the left they think that we're boogie Manning George Soros a little bit this sort of evil wicked guy coincidentally I actually when I was as a young actor in New York I was hired to be a sommelier at George Soros's wedding I kid you not so I actually got to see these speeches firsthand and and it was really pretty nefarious left-wing stuff got to see I got to see the man I was several feet away from him and so I have heard from from the guys own mouth I've heard the goals of the open society foundation I can't if they ever found out I was a Republican there I would have literally been torn and feathered you know or maybe ritually so you're a good actor right yeah it's true I guess I was wearing my pink hat you know and looking real cool I already have my Maddow glasses on and so I do want to ask just in the last few minutes here about the soros of it all where he's got his tentacles and what we have to look out for it before the next election right and it's a great question Michael so one of the things that people need to realize is the Soros funded groups do two things right they fight against any effort to increase election security so the state of Ohio which I mentioned previously they had to fight against you know mark Elias who's the Clinton campaign attorney ahead of 2016 filed a lawsuit to block Ohio's implementation of their voter ID law well he was filing that on behalf of he was actually paid by George Soros to file that lawsuit the state of Ohio also has had you fight against its efforts as a noted to remove illegal voters from their voting rolls well Soros was behind that as well Soros money so this is what they do so they fund organizations to fight against any effort to increase election security at the same time he then funds groups like la raza and acorn who then go out and roust up as many voters as possible and funnel these voters through the gaps that the other organizations fight to make sure still exists regardless of whether these voters are illegal or not right I mean why have a corner in the Raza actually changed their name because of how chronically affiliated they were with voter registration fraud or voter from that one of the groups one of the groups on behalf of mark Elias who was he was working for this Republic Ohio organizing collaborative they actually had an employee arrested and sent to jail for registering dead people to vote so it just speaks to sort of the the Nexus of the organizations in the effort and yeah so I think it's actually quite insidious and it's kind of intelligent if you weren't concerned about the ramifications for the car right well you know president Trump has made inroads and a lot of formerly Democratic demographics you know blue-collar workers and he's increased to support among the black vote and he's done very well maybe we can also get some of the dead vote too you know that's been a solid Democrat block for decades but who knows I mean the miracles seemed to be happening so well just to give you an idea of why the voter rolls like whether there's dead people on the roles or felons or people that no longer live in that state and I know if to go but just to give you a quick example of how easy those vulnerabilities and errors can be exploited by motivated political groups the city of New York then enter the state of New York actually send in undercover agent into New York City elections because they wanted to see all right we know there's problems here and so they said we want to see how easily these problems are manipulated so they send in undercover agents to vote on behalf of felons on behalf of people that are dead for behalf of people that no longer lived in the state and they tried to cast a total of 63 ballot sixty one of those 63 attempts were successful while and and one of the only this includes like a 26 year old undercover agent voting on behalf of somebody that's nearly 80 years old right so it's not like there's not real matchy-matchy but one of the only people that was stopped was trying to vote on behalf of a felon who shouldn't have been on the voter rolls I'm the only reason they couldn't vote is because the felons mother was actually working the polling right unbelievable so I mean I think that's be so so they keep the air is in place and then the errors are incredibly easily exploitable and that's basically the recipe for how it happened well people have to read the book because it gives a lot of hope in that the the law is on our side the history is on our side the public opinion is on our side and hope it looks like we can protect the integrity of our elections a lot better in the future but you got to know where the problem is so you got to read the book Eric I will let you go thank you so much for being here great thanks Michael it great to be here Eric Eggers very terrifying I highly recommend you read fraud it reads very quickly it's really easily

left is tears tumblr because also we're not going to let them steal the elections you'll need this otherwise she'll drown go to daily we're calm we'll be back to talk about John McCain and Alexandria Ocasio Cortes we're gonna find out one day that Alexandria Oh Cassio Cortez is actually constructed by Republican strategists to give us something to talk about I think give us something to make fun of to give us so you know my gosh she's got another one which is really great I'm gonna explain to her why her latest statement also proves she's not the expert she made one of the stupidest statements she's ever made before that let's talk about john mccain john mccain died he he you know american war hero he was shot down over vietnam he served his country he was held as a prisoner of war for years and years he refused early release he didn't want to jump the line he could have jumped the line because his father was a very important admiral and he didn't do that that alone is worthy of admiration even though people have political disagreements with john mccain conservatives do certainly but regardless that that alone is worthy of admiration we shouldn't lose sight of that the thing i want to talk about really john mccain doesn't need us to talk about him he's lived a very consequential life in american politics plaudits are flying in he's you know his service speaks for itself you know what what i do want to talk about is the mainstream media because the mainstream media or they are loving john mccain right now they are article after article attacking people for not saying enough about john mccain and i am reminded of how the mainstream media treated John McCain in 2008 do you remember this because I'm old enough to remember when John McCain was racist he was old he's senile he's stupid he's an adulterer he this was with the mainstream media said this is what the left said in 2008 now all of a sudden he's Saint John he's he's you know the greatest American who's ever lived and it's so awful all those unctuous mainstream media vultures who politicized this guy's death what should be said about John McCain is he has a distinguished record of service to the country he was a prisoner of war he chose to remain which was very courageous loved his country his record speaks for itself they just have to politicize everything attack Donald Trump or to attack John McCain when he posed a threat to them here is here's just an investigation a sort of special about John McCain that ran in 2008 when he was running for the president here's how CNN treated John McCain then McCain wrote on his memoir it began dating Cindy after he's separated from his wife Carol in fact his own divorce filings shows they dated for nine months while he was still living with Carol and records show he applied for a marriage license in Arizona before his divorce was final the chronology that has presented publicly doesn't necessarily match the chronology of the documents that you had applied for a marriage license in Arizona at a time when your divorce wasn't final yet dun dun dun the music that McCain revealed like this guy is the worst person who ever lived because he cheated on his wife mind you this is the cable news network that defended Bill Clinton vigorously during all of his sex scandals vigorously defended him but now bum-bum-bum we're gonna get John McCain revealed they were awful to this guy they savaged him Barack Obama aired a commercial that said McCain was too old to know how to use email and the network's ran with this story is too old he's senile he's racist he's an adulterer he picked Sarah Palin who's an idiot mind you Sarah Palin much more qualified to be president than Barack Obama much much more qualified to be President all of these things they they ruined this guy's life and reputation when he posed a threat to them and then when he stopped posing a threat and one when it was convenient politically for them to embrace him that's when they embraced him it's really disgusting I can't even I can't even think about it you know voxcom which is not the most honest media site out there at least they were honest about this they were honest about their their disdain for John McCain they said John McCain he he created Trump basically because he chose Sarah Palin as a running mate they say that because of that he advocated populism which allowed Trump to come in at least Fox was honest though because they don't they don't like John McCain they don't like Republicans to them you know if John McCain were still alive and running for president again they'd do the same thing they'd say he's a racist and sexist and all that kind of stuff and this is where I'd like to make an observation about the hysteria around Trump's response to McCain's death at least Trump was being sort of consistent here to John McCain sent out this tweet and his tweet said quote my deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain our hearts and prayers are with you and he's being pilloried because he didn't give a nice eulogy to John McCain or a panegyric or something if Donald Trump ran basically against John McCain he ran a John McCain opposed the Trump agenda Donald Trump said mean nasty things about John McCain he said he wasn't a war hero he just you know he's been running against him John McCain was the vote that killed the Obamacare repeal they've got a lot of bad blood between the two of them what was Donald Trump supposed to say as she was predicting weeks ago I said what are the odds that we get through the death of John McCain without a horrific offensive statement from Donald Trump what are the odds and then we did we made it through he said on my respecting condolences to the family perhaps this is just an aspect of me having low expectations what more do you want what more could we have asked for what if he said what if he came out and said John McCain is a great hero and he was a wonderful man and I love John McCain then what would the press be saying about him he's a liar he's a hypocrite how dare he talk about John McCain you're not fit to shine John McCain's shoes they anything he said they'd be ripping apart I thought as far as the potential responses that we could have gotten from President Trump this was pretty good Ben you didn't say anything mean about him he didn't rehash old battles he just said my respect and condolences go out to the family that's fine chalk it up as a win how should conservatives feel we're running out of time but we should talk about this how I should conservatives feel we didn't always agree with John McCain on very many important issues we disagreed it intensely with John McCain he he passed mccain feingold which was that campaign finance legislation that was then overturned by the Supreme Court because it was a violation of free speech he was always a maverick as he was styled in the media he wasn't a conservative he wouldn't have really called himself a hard-line conservative he would cross the aisle frequently he touted his relationships with Democrats in the Senate he I believe he wanted to choose Joe Lieberman to be his running mate in 2008 so sure conservatives don't agree with John McCain politically a lot of the time still the guy died the guy just died he served his country his war service alone should be enough to say he was a man who loved his country I didn't see eye to eye to it with him but he loved his country serve this country and rest in peace that's what conservatives should say we can relitigate certain policy differences later on especially as they become more important again these things always crop up but you know salute John McCain I realized technically he's not the first president I voted for because when I was 6 years old my mother let me go into the booth with her I convinced her to vote for Dole and she let me pull the lever so maybe I maybe I committed election fraud maybe I'm gonna be an Eric Edgar his next book but John McCain is the first guy I voted for when I turned 18 and I got two you know I got to actually do it myself and pull the lever so rest easy Senator McCain and before we go I guess we've just got a couple more minutes now Alexandria Ocasio Cortes she's back she's back the gift that keeps on giving Ocasio tweeted out this quote hashtag abolish ice means not having an agency that incarcerates children and sexually assaults women with impunity it does not mean abolish deportation also I have no problem saying white supremacy has no place in this country it's the GOP that struggles to say that GOP founded to free the slaves found in to free the slaves from the Democrats how many just a question for all the Republicans watching how many of you struggle to say that white supremacy is bad any zero zero people say that okay that's what I thought but I would I would like to make this point clear for Ocasio Cortes I know she watches this show I know she do she watches it every day religiously she is caught here because ice just deported an actual Nazi from the country immigration and customs enforcement went in and deported a Nazi war criminal back to Germany so yes does it like isn't some deportations are good aren't Oh cassia and she's saying no abolish ice does not mean abolish deportation so I'm gonna lay this out free ice stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement immigration enforcement means deporting people who have immigrated illegally who are in the country illegally therefore and see if you can stay with me abolishing immigration enforcement means abolishing the mechanism of immigration enforcement which is deportations QED qe that's the that's the all right is that fair I don't I feel like I'm a crazy person now because you've got a major star of the Democrat Party saying that that's not what it means that's clearly what it means this is a big loser issue she knows that she's saying these slogans because she doesn't know anything because she's not the expert to put it mildly and so they're saying abolish eyes only a quarter of Democrats want to abolish immigration enforcement and the only reason they want to do that is because they don't know they know even less than Ocasio does so she's got to walk this back but let's just be very clear I don't want to let her off the hook abolishing ice means abolishing deportations if you don't want to abolish deportations then you don't want to abolish ice if you do want to abolish ice you want to abolish deportations she should give an answer on this then we should hold her feet to the fire I don't know why she keeps going in public I don't know why she keeps going on television the race is hers just shut up and you'll win the race the more the only risk you have of not winning this race somehow is when you open your mouth but we should get an answer from her on that I hope she keeps opening her mouth because she's just a joy what a delight it's why I wake up in the morning Oh what did what did that little socialist lady say today guru-guru okay that's our show tuning we got a lot of good
