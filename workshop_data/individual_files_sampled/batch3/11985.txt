staying with all things football we're now joined live in the studio by Matthew Bart who's a co-founder of photography project goal click which documents football culture around the world including in Russia so tell us a bit more about your project just so we can get a good idea of what it's about so go click is a global football photography project we find people from every country in the world we give them disposable analog cameras and we ask them to tell a story about their country and through football so we're currently active in around 90 countries for Russia we decided to do a bigger project looking at the real Russia so we found 8 photographers from all over the country from nizhny novgorod to Yekaterinburg and Volgograd to kazan and we asked them to document the country through their own eyes ahead of the World Cup with this particular collaboration what Russian football story impressed you the most I think it would be the Ural Mountains it was a very unusual set of photos which really reveals grassroots football and Russian culture through through the game and the photos that we received from the Ural Mountains were fantastic really looking at how Soviet infrastructure and Soviet football infrastructure has developed into the 21st century now obviously Russia is hosting the World Cup right now one of the main reasons you're here I can only assume why is focusing on football at this time a good way to get to know the real Russia so I think that what this World Cup really was a chance for us to do was to tell some stories about as you say the real Russia and the ordinary people in Russian society and a lot of the focus quite rightly in the lead-up to the tournament is on the the stadiums the infrastructure and the teams and the World Cup itself what we want what we really wanted to do was was tell those untold stories and really give Russians a chance to give their own first-person perspective on their own country so that's that's a really important part of gold click bringing through those stories in an unfiltered way and you've run similar projects in other countries like you were listening there at the beginning ink in war zones have you noticed anything common in term of football stories to all of these places some sort of string that goes through everywhere yeah I think there is there's one thing I would say particularly about what the Russia project has surprised me with and that is how similar Russia is really to a lot of other countries I think there's a perception maybe that Russia is very different in some way to the rest of the world and particularly to Europe and I think one of the things that came through particularly was the divide between urban and rural town and countryside a lot of the same stories that we hear from around the world in Europe in in Asia in Russia there is that difference between you know investment into football in in urban areas versus kind of the rest of the country as you say we've been working in many many countries around the world our first photos were from Sierra Leone with the national amputee football association schlosser and our photographer their pastor Abraham bangura he documented the life of amputees as a result of the civil war in Sierra Leone integrating into society through football we've also covered projects in Iraqi Kurdistan Andrew and tackling alleged legacy of genocide and so what I think that all of these projects show in whatever country are in is that you really can understand a people through football I wouldn't say that there's a common cliche that football somehow unites everybody I'm not saying that for me actually shows the differences but it also is a way of people understanding what another culture looks like how another people act because when you tell it through the lens of football it's so much more relatable even when there's differences between you know the cities themselves the big cities in the rural areas do still find the love from football what can bring to a community even if it's just a couple of posts and an empty field that's not been mowed and however long I think that the other thing that comes through with the Russian photos we've we've captured is the passion for the game exists in Russia even though there might be a lot of cynicism around the game in Russia and that comes through as well there is still passion there and in almost all of our photos from wherever it is in the world the there's normally a positive message coming through even under sometimes tragic circumstances and the legacy of war the legacy of conflict most of the stories even if they come from that perspective they have a positive outlook and so I would definitely describe the passion as always being there Matthew Barrett thank you so much for joining us today co-founder of gold click is a beautiful story and beautiful pictures thank you so much you very much
