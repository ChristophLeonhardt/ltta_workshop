MUELLER.

13
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:13,203
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE FORMER 

14
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,437
DEPUTY CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN OF THE

FALSE STATEMENTS IN THE RUSSIA 

20
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:21,812
PROBE.

21
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,146
HE HAS BEEN INDICTED, CHARGED 

22
00:46:23,146 --> 00:46:25,315
WITH SEVERAL COUNTS OF FRAUD, 

23
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,683
CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE UNITED

00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,692
WANT TO GET ALL THE DETAILS NOW 

31
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,127
FROM OUR CHIEF JUSTICE 

32

CORRESPONDENT PIERRE THOMAS.

33
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:38,561
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.

34
00:46:38,561 --> 00:46:41,031
RICK GATES, FORMER DEPUTY 

35
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:42,165
CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR PRESIDENT 

36
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:43,466
TRUMP'S ELECTION BID, IS TODAY 

37
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:44,268
PLEADING GUILTY.

38
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,203
TWO COUNTS, FIRST HE'S PLEADING 

39
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:47,638
GUILTY FOR ENGAGING IN A 

40
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,105
CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD THE UNITED

41
00:46:49,105 --> 00:46:50,307
STATES GOVERNMENT BY NOT 

42
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,742
REPORTING FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS 

43
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,377
THAT COULD BE TAXED, AND FAILING

44
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,345
TO REGISTER AS A FOREIGN AGENT 

45
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,847
FOR WORK ON BEHALF OF UKRAINIAN 

46
00:46:57,847 --> 00:46:59,048
OFFICIALS WHO HAD CLOSE TIES TO 

47
00:46:59,048 --> 00:46:59,917
THE KREMLIN.

48
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,250
GATES IS ALSO PLEADING GUILTY TO

49
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,852
ONE COUNT OF LYING TO A SPECIAL 

50
00:47:02,852 --> 00:47:04,454
COUNSEL ABOUT THE NATURE OF WORK

51
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:05,956
DONE FOR THOSE UKRAINIAN 

52
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:06,323
OFFICIALS.

53
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,491
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL OFFICE 

54
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,793
CLAIMS THAT GATES ENGAGED IN 

55
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,362
THIS CONSPIRACY WITH PAUL 

56
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:12,895
MANAFORT, TRUMP'S FORMER 

57
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,397
CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN.

58
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:14,831
MANAFORT HAS PLEADED NOT GUILTY 

59
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,700
BUT NOW ONE OF HIS PRINCIPAL 

60
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,102
BUSINESS PARTNERS IS SET TO BE 

61
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:19,736
AND COOPERATING WITH THE SPECIAL

62
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:22,973
COUNSEL.

63
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:23,973
SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE 

64
00:47:23,973 --> 00:47:25,542
ENORMOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR 

65
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:25,809
MANAFORT.

66
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,210
>> UNDER THE DOZENS OF CHARGES 

67
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,811
HE WAS FACING BEFORE TODAY'S 

68
00:47:28,811 --> 00:47:29,846
PLEA AGREEMENT, HE COULD HAVE 

69
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:32,182
FACED YEARS AND YEARS IN PRISON.

70
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,216
WHAT SHOULD HE EXPECT NOW?

71
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:35,719
>> WELL, HE FACES AT LEAST UP TO

72
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,554
20 YEARS IN PRISON UNDER SOME OF

73
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:38,588
THOSE PREVIOUS CHARGES.

74
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:40,223
BUT BY OUR CALCULATIONS, HE'S 

75
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:42,926
LOOKING AT SOMEWHERE MAXIMUM OF 

76
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,261
BETWEEN FOUR AND SEVEN YEARS IN 

77
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:44,628
PRISON, GEORGE.

78
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:45,762
>> THAT'S THE MAXIMUM.

79
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,564
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE 

80
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:48,331
RECOMMENDATION OF THE SPECIAL 

81
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:49,466
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER.

82
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:49,766
>> EXACTLY.

83
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,468
WE EXPECT THAT HE'S GOING TO 

84
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:52,402
COOPERATE, GEORGE, AND THAT 

85
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:53,904
COULD GIVE HIM MUCH MORE LENIENT

86
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:54,538
TIME, AS WELL.

87
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,806
>> OKAY, PIERRE, THANKS VERY 

88
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:56,173
MUCH.

89
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,974
WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF LEGAL

90
00:47:57,974 --> 00:47:59,108
ANALYST DAN ABRAMS.

91
00:47:59,108 --> 00:48:00,277
RIGHT NOW THE BIG QUESTION WITH 

92
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:01,511
THIS AGREEMENT WHAT DID HE GIVE 

93
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,447
TO ROBERT MUELLER TO GET IT?

94
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:04,114
>> THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY 

95
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,214
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THIS DEAL 

96
00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:05,782
UNLESS THEY FELT GATES HAD 

97
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:06,349
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO 

98
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:08,151
OFFER THEM.

99
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:09,319
AND SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING OUT 

100
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:12,356
THERE, WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS IS 

101
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,124
SO THEY CAN HELP GET HIS FORMER 

102
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:14,324
BOSS.

103
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,360
BUT MUELLER ALREADY HAD -- 

104
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:16,560
RIGHT.

105
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,994
SO MUELLER MAY NOT HAVE NEEDED 

106
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:18,962
GATES FOR MANAFORT.

107
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,497
SO THAT'S WHAT LEADS TO THE 

108
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:21,698
REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION.

109
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,533
WHICH IS, WHAT ELSE MIGHT GATES 

110
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,602
BE ABLE TO OFFER?

111
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:26,770
HE WAS THERE.

112
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,470
LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION.

113
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:30,707
HE TLFS DURING THE TRANSITION.

114
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,409
HE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP MUELLER 

115
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,945
PUT SOME OF THESE PIECES 

116
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:38,348
TOGETHER, WITH REGARD TO THE 

117
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:39,449
COLLUSION THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL

118
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,217
PART OF THIS CASE.

119
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:41,852
>> NOW WE HAVE THREE TOP 

120
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:42,986
OFFICIALS, THREE OFFICIALS IN 

121
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:46,623
THE CAMPAIGN WHO'VE ALL GONE NOW

122
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,425
WITH ROBERT MUELLER.

123
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,626
MIKE FLYNN, GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS 

124
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:50,994
FOREIGN POLICY ADVISER, RICK 

125
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:53,864
GATES, DEPUTY CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN.

126
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:54,431
>> AND EACH ONE OF THEM ARE 

127
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,832
GOING TO BE OFFERING INFORMATION

128
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,801
THAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL FEELS 

129
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,903
IS IMPORTANT NOT IN SOME MINOR 

130
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,037
ISSUE, BUT YOU MAKE THESE KINDS 

131
00:49:01,037 --> 00:49:02,906
OF DEALS, BECAUSE THE SPECIAL 

132
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,507
COUNSEL THINKS THAT THEY CAN 

133
00:49:04,507 --> 00:49:06,309
OFFER INFORMATION.

134
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:07,344
THEY CAN TESTIFY AGAINST CERTAIN

135
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:07,711
PEOPLE.

136
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:10,647
THEY CAN OFFER TIMES, AND DATES,

137
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:12,015
AND PHONE CALLS, THAT ARE 

138
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:12,949
RELEVANT TO THIS INVESTIGATION.

139
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,317
AND SPEAKING OF THAT, I THINK 

140
00:49:14,317 --> 00:49:15,351
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ONE 

141
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:17,353
OF THE TWO COUNTS THAT GATES IS 

142
00:49:17,353 --> 00:49:19,656
PLEADING GUILTY TO IS A FALSE 

143
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:20,824
STATEMENT MADE THIS MONTH.

144
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:21,924
>> JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

145
00:49:21,924 --> 00:49:24,227
>> WHILE THEY WERE TRYING TO 

146
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:25,228
NEGOTIATE THIS DEAL.

147
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:26,529
WHICH SHOWS YOU THAT THEY ARE 

148
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:28,498
SAYING, HE WAS LYING TO US EVEN 

149
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,766
AS WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 

150
00:49:30,766 --> 00:49:30,967
THIS.

151
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,569
>> NOW THERE IS A MAJOR 

152
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:33,603
DEVELOPMENT IN THE RUSSIA 

153
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:33,936
INVESTIGATION.

154
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:34,637
MUCH MORE TONIGHT ON "WORLD NEWS

155

156
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,874
HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON.

157
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,409
>> THIS HAS BEEN A SPECIAL

00:49:39,409 --> 00:00:00,000
REPORT F
