now that Barack Obama's tenure as president is coming to an end the great man is beginning to wax philosophical for example in Wired magazine the president has written an article in which he says quote right now is the greatest time to be alive unquote and isn't that just so true right now is the greatest time to be alive because a person who isn't alive right now is dead and being dead is worse than being alive because worms eat you and you can't get HBO some people who aren't alive right now I've never even been born and that's a terrible thing because you have to hang around waiting for your parents to have sex which let's face it as disgusting even to contemplate then for nine months you're stuck inside your mother listening to her complain about how you're making her life miserable and you can't even get outside to show her just how miserable you can really make her when given half a chance Plus at any moment some psychopath from Planned Parenthood might start ripping you to pieces and selling your body parts whereupon the whole great time for the alive thing becomes sort of a moot point in another philosophical moment President Obama told an innovation conference that he wants to reign in what he called the wild wild west media all this freedom of information has gotten out of hand the president said any crank with a conspiracy theory can run around telling people that I used the IRS to target conservative groups or corrupted the Justice Department for political purposes who was born in Kenya it's absurd I was born in Hawaii this madness has got to stop it's not just a president who's grown reflective the media are also taking time to discuss what a great great leader Obama has been in an article in The New York Times a former newspaper opinion editor blithering for variation the third writes quote some people look around and see Obama care collapsing and the United States growing weaker and the world growing more dangerous and an over-regulated and overtaxed economy propped up by printed money and free credit in such a way that can only lead to a complete disaster but pessimists like that are only looking at reality they should read our paper instead none of those things is happening here and it's right here in these pages that Barack Obama is one of the greatest presidents who has ever lived The Times objective journalism editor during prevarication the third no relation agrees with the opinion editor was a totally different person just with a similar sounding name mister third says quote this is a country steeped in racism so it was a great day when we elected a black president to tell us how steeped in racism we are soon we'll have a woman president - tell us how steeped in sexes and we are and won't that be fun President Obama is so right this is a great time to be a liar or alive whatever unquote trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show you
