put aside Donald Trump's tweets and its media distractions and here is the policy that the Trump administration is rolling out today a broad and drastic cut to health organizations that are involved in pro-choice counseling and abortion that hits clinics it hits Planned Parenthood and critics say could endanger women's health and limit constitutionally protected medical choices the immediate result here is cuts of millions of dollars in federal funding to any group that provides referrals or even procedures related to abortions a policy broader than just limiting money for abortion itself which is already restricted under federal law this D funds groups that refer women to abortion providers and mandates physical separation between a clinic that gets taxpayer money from an abortion provider it also slashes over 280 million from clinics now Trump campaign by saying he would be good for women's health he said that women are helped by Planned Parenthood but then on the trail he also said he would defund it Planned Parenthood has done very good work for some for many many for millions of women we're not going to allow and we're not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood I'm gonna be really good for women I'm going to be good for women's health issues I would defund it because I'm pro-life but millions of women are helped by planned terror I am joined now by Elysee hog president of NARAL pro-choice America which works with Planned Parenthood and Wendy Davis a former Texas State Senator who made headlines holding a 13-hour filibuster trying to block abortion law that restricted access in her state of Texas in 2013 at least what does this mean well I mean re what I think it really means is that they're worried about the upcoming elections and they're trying to throw a bone to their extreme base but I think it's a terrible miscalculation we know that the majority of this country supports legal access to abortion supports Planned Parenthood and other providers and that our side has really fired up and they're they're hemorrhaging Women Voters from their party so I think it's a tragic miscalculation and it's gonna tragically revert women in the process wendy part of what is clearly on the table with donald trump here is a transactional or negotiated approach to this and we showed the clips that were all over the place i want to play for you Cecile Richards who you both know and I think have worked with the times describing her dealings with the Trump administration while she was head of very relevant lis Planned Parenthood take a listen what Jared Kushner said to me is if I can get a headline that says Planned Parenthood discontinues abortion services I could probably guarantee your funding and I said we will never do that Wendy what does that tell you I mean basically what's happening here Ari is that there are over four million women in this country low-income women women of color who rely on title ten funding for their reproductive care for their birth control for their preventive care and for their well woman care and they are at risk of losing that care and if you need to see what it looks like to actually carry through the kind of defunding that's being talked about at the federal level you need look no further than my state that happened here in 2011 over 80 clinics closed not all of them were Planned Parenthood's and none of them were providing abortion services and in the process yeah I want you to continue but just to be clear you're saying that a version of this at the local level acted to close 80 facilities that provided only health care and not actually abortions that's exactly right and the consequence of that in Texas which we know we're going to see at the federal level as well if this is carried out by the Trump administration we had an increase in teen pregnancy rates when right now in this country they're at an all-time low we had an increase in Medicaid births and the subsequent cost to taxpayers for those births and we had an increase in maternal mortality that same consequences being seen because of the global gag order that the Trump administration is now talking about putting in place domestically here so so Wendy let me let me ask and are gonna be her let me ask it this way because you're really laying out the actual microcosmic results of this in a place where it was tried there's a constitutional question about whether something that the Supreme Court says is a right in this country people can debate it there's a lot of debate about it but women have a right to this choice under the current law and that's one conversation the second is the actual impact and what you're what you're proposing for you and then Elise is well weigh in is that on the narrower question of the results this kind of thing can actually increase the number of teen pregnancies when applied no question because when you remove people's access to contraceptive care they have more unintended pregnancies it's just a natural consequence I'm sorry at least I didn't mean interrupt you when you can always interrupt me I think the third piece which we haven't yet talked about re but is equally important is that not only does this limit service and have devastating health care effects in fact counter to what they say their goal is but what should really send a chill up people's finds is that this is massive government overreaching into the kind of information that we can receive from our medical professionals and that is because they know if women have the truth about our options there are gender folds and we've seen them looking for ways to lie and deceive women every which way they can we've seen this scorched earth approach not only a windy in my home state of Texas but also under vice-president pence in Indiana where not only did team pregnancy go up when they closed all that health clinics but HIV rates went up and maternal outcomes went down so no price is too high for these people to play pay in their quest to end legal abortion and control women's lives it's it's very educational honestly listening to both of you I think people who might even disagree as we know there is disagreement round the country about some aspects of this issue would hear things tonight that would really give you pause to this kind of federal restriction which as we mentioned is one of most important stories in America tonight hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe
