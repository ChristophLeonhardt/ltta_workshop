there were early signs of a record high turnout that could favor the Opposition in preventing Hungary's ruling party Fidesz and Prime Minister Viktor Orban from winning a third consecutive two-thirds majority in parliament what's at stake well we've already said everything about that what's at stake is the future of Hungary it's not only parties a government or a prime minister that we're choosing for ourselves but a future as well voting a secret but I'll reveal that I voted for for this two votes for Fidesz because I thought that was the safest beer in the past Orban has altered the Constitution changing the electoral law and curbing media freedoms and he's promised to go further targeting NGOs and civil society possibly even the independence of the judiciary this is a country in which allegations of high-level corruption of rife in which public services like health and education are in desperate need of investment and yet state-run media is full of scare stories about Muslim migration and even an anti-semitic campaign aimed at the billionaire George Soros and his network of pro-democracy pro-american NGOs here he is surrounded by the opposition figures holding bolt cutters getting ready to tear down the fence that Viktor Orban built to keep the refugees out opposition figures say Hungary's future in Europe is at stake are 28 years after the change of regime this is the first election which has some not just political but historical consequence or ball hesitation between West and East who is other friends Berlin Paris London Rome or Moscow or Azerbaijan this is on the stake yet it is the same opposition figures whose failure to unite behind a single party makes it so hard to beat Fidesz and Orban the Prime Minister has used his power not just to undermine democratic values at home but also in building fences and rejecting refugee quotas to goad and test the European you in a wider sense therefore a win that is not a two-thirds majority win would amount to a substantial defeat Jonah hole al jazeera Budapest
