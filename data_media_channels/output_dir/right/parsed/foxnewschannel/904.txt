REPORT BECAUSE WE TOOK A LOT OF
PUSHBACK ON SOME OF THIS
REPORTING AND I'M GLAD TO SEE A
LOT OF IT WAS INDICATED.
>> Shannon: CATHERINE, GREAT
JOB.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
INSPECTOR GENERAL CONCLUDED TEXT
BETWEEN FBI AGENTS IMPLIED ONE
OF THEM "MIGHT BE WILLING TO
TAKE OFFICIAL ACTION AGAINST
THEN CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP YET
KEY PLAYERS ARE NOT OVER WHETHER
THAT MEANS THERE BIAS IMPACTED
THEIR INVESTIGATION.
>> THIS REPORT DID NOT FIND ANY
EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL BIAS OR
IMPROPER CONSIDERATIONS ACTUALLY
IMPACTING THE INVESTIGATION
UNDER REVIEW.
>> CHRIS WRAY, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE
WRONG.
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES.
THIS IS A BITTERLY DISAPPOINTING
REPORT.
>> Shannon: LET'S TURN TO
BRAND-NEW FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR
ANDREW McCARTHY.
HE'S BEEN TRACKING THIS A LONG
TIME WITH ALL THE MUELLER STUFF.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
>> GREAT TO BE HERE.
THANK YOU.
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK A
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT WE'VE
LEARNED TODAY.
I WANT TO START WITH THIS
COMMENT FROM CONGRESSMAN TREY
GOWDY EARLIER TONIGHT ON
"SPECIAL REPORT."
>> PETER STRZOK, THE FBI AGENT
WHO WAS ON HILLARY CLINTON'S
INVESTIGATION ARGUABLY THE LEAD
RUSSIA INVESTIGATOR, NOT ONLY
WANTED TO STOP HIS CAMPAIGN BUT
ONCE HE WON, GOT ON THE MUELLER
PROBE BECAUSE HE WANTED TO
IMPEACH HIM.
THAT'S A LEVEL OF ANIMUS AND
BIAS THAT EVERYONE SHOULD
REJECT.
>> Shannon: AND D, THE OVERALL
CONCLUSION OF THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL IS THAT IF
THERE WAS POLITICAL BIAS, THEY
DIDN'T SEE EVIDENCE IT THAT
FACTORED INTO ANY DECISIONS
MADE ON THE INVESTIGATION.
DOES THAT SETTLE IT FOR YOU?
>> NO, IT REALLY DOESN'T.
THINK ABOUT HOW CAREFULLY THEIR
WORDING THIS.
I REALLY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN THEY
SAY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE BECAUSE
THAT MEANS THERE IS NO
SUGGESTION IN THE RECORD THAT
BIAS COULD HAVE BEEN A FACTOR.
WHILE THEY ARE SAYING HERE AND
IT'S VERY CAREFULLY DONE IS THAT
WHILE THE IG WAS EVALUATING WAS
A SERIES OF JUDGMENT CALLS AND
THEY WERE NOT GOING TO
SECOND-GUESS PEOPLE'S
DISCRETIONARY JUDGMENT BECAUSE
THEIR METRIC WAS, WAS THE
DECISION MADE A RATIONAL, NOT
WHETHER THEY AGREED WITH FEDERAL
WHETHER IT WAS THE ONLY DECISION
THAT COULD'VE BEEN MADE
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
IF THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE COMING
FROM AND YOU'RE ALSO SAYING AT
THE SAME TIME THERE IS PERVASIVE
EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAD BIAS,
THEY CAN'T RULE OUT THE FACT
THAT BIAS MAY HAVE PLAYED IN AND
MAY HAVE BEEN DECISIVE.
WHAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY SAYING IS
WE DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE HERE FROM
WHICH WE CAN CONCLUDE FOR
CERTAINTY THAT BIAS WAS WHAT THE
DRIVING FACTOR WAS HERE.
BUT THEY CAN'T DISCOUNT IT.
FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO SAY
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT BIAS
PLAYED A ROLE HERE IS JUST
PREPOSTEROUS.
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE REPORT SAYS.
>> Shannon: WELL, IT FEELS A
LITTLE BIT LIKE THE DAVID JAMES
COMEY, THEN FBI DIRECTOR, CAME
OUT AND OUTLINED THIS ENTIRE
CASE WHAT HAPPENED WITH
HILLARY CLINTON AND THEN AT THE
END SAID BUT THERE'S NOTHING
PROSECUTABLE HERE.
WERE GOING TO DECLINE TO MOVE
FORWARD WITH ANY RECOMMENDATION
ALONG THAT LINE.
SOMETHING I LEARNED FOR THE
FIRST TIME TODAY HERE IS THAT
THERE WERE FIVE DIFFERENT FBI
EMPLOYEES THEY FOUND TEXT AND
MESSAGES THAT THEY WERE
CONCERNED ABOUT.
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT PETER STRZOK
AND LISA PAGE BUT THERE WERE
OTHER PEOPLE WE DON'T HAVE A
NAME YET FOUR.
DO YOU THINK WE WILL GET THOSE?
>> I THINK EVENTUALLY WILL GET A
LOT MORE INFORMATION THAN WE
HAVE NOT, PARTICULARLY IN THE
CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS.
AND I THINK WHERE WE WILL END UP
GETTING A LOT OF INFORMATION,
SHANNON, IS WHEN WE GET THE
OTHER HALF OF THE STORY.
I MEAN, IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED HERE.
THE FBI AND THIS IS EVIDENT FROM
THE TEXT MESSAGES OF STRZOK AND
PAGE, THEY CONSIDERED THE
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION AND
THE TRUMP RUSSIA INVESTIGATION
AS A SINGLE CONTINUUM TO THE
POINT THAT WHEN CREWS DROPPED
OUT OF THE RACE AND IT WAS CLEAR
TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE THE
NOMINEE, THE FIRST THING THESE
TO SAY IS, AND REACTING TO TRUMP
BEING THE NOMINEE, MAN, WE'VE
GOT TO GET THIS HILLARY CLINTON
EMAIL INVESTIGATION DONE.
RATCHETS UP THE PRESSURE TO AND
MADE YOUR EXAM, WHICH IS WHAT
THEY CALLED IT.
AND THE MINDS OF THE AGENTS,
THIS WAS ONE SERIES OF
INVESTIGATIONS TOGETHER THAT
IMPACTED THE ELECTION.
AND THE REASON THIS IS IMPORTANT
IS YOU CAN LOOK AT ALL THE
DIFFERENT DECISIONS THAT GOT
WAITED BY INSPECTOR GENERAL
HOROWITZ AND LOOK AT THEM IN THE
ISOLATION OF THE CLINTON EMAIL
CASE AND SAY YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THAT LOOKS REASONABLE.
MAYBE THAT'S REASONABLE.
MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE WHAT I
WOULD'VE DONE BUT OKAY.
BUT WHAT YOU DON'T GET IS
COMPARING HOW THEY HANDLED THE
EMAIL INVESTIGATION TO HOW THEY
HANDLED THE TRUMP-RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION.
SO IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT A
DECISION THAT THEY MAKE TO GIVE
A GUY IMMUNITY EVEN
THOUGH THEY HAD IRONCLAD
EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD LIED TO THE
FBI AND WAS INVOLVED IN THE
DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE, THEY
MAKE A CASE FOR WHY IT WAS
REASONABLE TO GIVE THE GUY
IMMUNITY.
IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT IN THE
ABSTRACT, YOU, YOU WOULD SAY
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE NOT WHAT I
WOULD'VE DONE BUT REASONABLE.
YOU DON'T GET TO COMPARE THAT TO
THE FIVE GUYS THAT MUELLER HAS
INVESTIGATED WHERE THE LIES THAT
WERE TOLD WERE NOT NEAR THE CORE
OF WHAT HE WAS INVESTIGATING,
AND YET HAVING THEM OVER THE
BARREL, HE PROSECUTED EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THEM FOR FALSE
STATEMENTS AND GOT THEM TO
