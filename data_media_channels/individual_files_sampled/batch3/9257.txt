CARAVAN. THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S ANGLE. YOU HAVE SEEN THESE PHOTOS. WELL, THE CURRENT SITUATION AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER, IS COMPLETELY OUT OF HAND. THAT CARAVAN OF CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS THAT STARTED DOWN TO ABOUT 200 PEOPLE OR SO, AND MANY OF THEM ARE CAMPED OUT AT JUST A STONE'S THROW FROM THE U.S. CUSTOMS CHECK POINT. NOW, AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING, THE ALIENS ARE BEING COACHED IN SOME CASES, BY AMERICAN LAWYERS, TRAVELING TO THE CARAVAN, AND TELLING THEM HOW TO QUALIFY FOR ASYLUM. THIS UNDOUBTEDLY INFURIATES MANY OF YOU, WHO WOULD ALSO LOVE FREE LEGAL ADVICE. WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE? THE PRESIDENT AS WELL IS TOTALLY FED UP. HE TWEETED THIS WEEK THE MIGRANT CARAVAN THAT IS OPENLY DEFYING OUR BORDER SHOWS HOW WEAK AND INEFFECTIVE U.S. IMMIGRATION LAWS ARE.
