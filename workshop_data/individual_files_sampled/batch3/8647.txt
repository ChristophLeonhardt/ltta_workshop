JUDGE JEANINE: I READ RECENTLY THAT KIM KARDASHIAN MAY BE TAKING A BREAK FROM TAKING SELFIES. BUT IT PUT ME IN A SELFIE FRAME OF MIND. NATIONAL SELFIE DAY I HIT THE STREETS WITH STREET JUSTICE. HERE I AM IN NEW YORK TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF NEW YORKERS ARE GOING TO GIVE UP DOING SELFIES SINCE KIM KARDASHIAN IS NO LONGER HIGH ON SELFIES. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WANT TO TAKE A SELFIE? KIM KARDASHIAN SAYS SHE IS NOT TAKING THEM THAT MUCH ANYMORE. THAT'S A LIE. JUDGE JEANINE: WHY? BECAUSE SHE IS SO SELF-ABSORBED SHE WANTS TO SEE HERSELF. DO PEOPLE SMILE, DO THEY SMOOCH? SMILE. JUDGE JEANINE: LET'S TAKE A SELFIE. KIM KARDASHIAN SAYS SHE IS NOT TAKING SELFIES THAT MUCH. DO YOU THINK SHE CAN GET THROUGH THE DAY WITHOUT TAKING PICTURES OF HERSELF. SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE TAKING PICTURES OF HER SHE DOESN'T NEED TO DO IT HERSELF. JUDGE JEANINE: DO YOU TAKE SELFIES? NO. JUDGE JEANINE: DO YOU KNOW WHAT A SELFIE IS? YES. JUDGE JEANINE: IT'S ON VIDEO. WATCH IT. KIM KARDASHIAN SAYS SHE IS NOT TAKING SELFIES ANYMORE. OH, PLEASE, NEVER. I WOULD NEVER BELIEVE THAT. I CAN'T IMAGINE HER STAYING OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT. JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT MAKES A GOOD SELFIE? GOING HIGHER THAN YOURSELF. JUDGE JEANINE: LIKE THIS? IT PROJECTS AMAZING LIGHT. JUDGE JEANINE: WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO LOOK BETTER THAN YOU LOOK IN PERSON, THEN WHEN PEOPLE MEET YOU THEY ARE DISAPPOINTED. YOU HIDE IN YOUR ROOM AND MAKE EVERYONE THINK YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL. JUDGE JEANINE: SHOULD YOU SMILE? A LOT OF GIRLS GO FOR THE DUCK FACE. JUDGE JEANINE: HOW MANY SELFIES DOES IT TAKE TO GET THE PERFECT SELFIE? AT LEAST 100. JUDGE JEANINE: DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY SELFIES IT TAKES TO GET A PERFECT SELFIE? WHO HAS THAT KIND OF TIME? HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN SELFIES? YES, BUT I DON'T SHARE THEM. JUDGE JEANINE: YOU MAKE THEM FOR YOURSELF? THAT'S A SELFIE.
