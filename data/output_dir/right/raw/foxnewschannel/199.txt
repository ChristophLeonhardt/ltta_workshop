00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,245
MARK: HELLO AMERICA, I'M MARK

3
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:06,745
LEVIN.

4
00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:08,380
THIS IS "LIFE, LIBERTY &

5
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:08,714
LEVIN."

6
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:12,017
WE HAVE A GREAT GUEST, GEORGE

7
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:13,552
GILDER, HOW ARE YOU?

8
00:00:13,553 --> 00:00:15,587
>> GREAT TO SEE YOU, MARK.

9
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:19,024
MARK: I'VE READ YOU FOR YEARS,

10
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:19,992
MARK, WE'VE NEVER MET.

11
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:20,959
YOU ATTENDED HARVARD AND YOU

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,694
STILL ARE SUCCESSFUL.

13
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:24,163
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

14
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:26,698
>> I WASN'T SUCCESSFUL AT

15
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:27,032
HARVARD.

16
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:29,034
MARK: YEAH, YOU PIONEERED THE

17
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:30,102
FORMULATION OF SUPPLY SIDE

18
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:33,672
ECONOMICS WHEN YOU SERVED AS

19
00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:35,207
CHAIRMAN OF THE INSTITUTE'S

20
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,208
ECONOMIC ROUNDTABLE.

21
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:37,576
PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE

22
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:40,012
MANHATTAN INSTITUTE, YOU'RE THE

23
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:42,815
AUTHOR OF MEN IN MARRIAGE.

24
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:43,582
VISIBLE MAN.

25
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,217
WEALTH AND POVERTY, WHICH WAS A

26
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:46,618
BIG BOOK THAT HAD A BIG

27
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:47,686
INFLUENCE ON ME.

28
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:53,659
THE SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE.

29
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,026
MICROCOSM.

30
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:54,393
TELECOSM.

31
00:00:54,394 --> 00:00:56,762
AND THE SILICON EYE.

32
00:00:56,763 --> 00:00:58,530
AND NOW YOUR NEWEST BECOME,

33
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:00,332
LIFE AFTER GOOGLE, THE FALL OF

34
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,068
BIG DATA AND THE RISE OF THE

35
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:03,836
BLOCKCHAIN ECONOMY.

36
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:06,004
A LOT TO UNRAVEL HERE.

37
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:10,075
LET'S GET STARTED THIS WAY.

38
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:13,812
CAPITALISM VERSUS SOCIALISM.

39
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:14,146
EXPLAIN.

40
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:17,616
>> WELL, CAPITALISM IS --

41
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:20,652
DERIVES FROM THE LATIN WORD FOR

42
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:23,755
HEAD, KAPUT, AND CAPITALISM IS

43
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:26,358
THE MIND-BASED SYSTEM AND THE

44
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:29,428
KEY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE HUMAN

45
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:31,730
MIND IS THAT WE'RE CREATIVE,

46
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:35,434
AND AS ALBERT HIRSCHMAN, THE

47
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:39,371
PRINCETON ECONOMIST ONCE PUT

48
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:42,407
IT, OF CREATIVITY ALWAYS COMES

49
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:46,879
AS A SURPRISE TO US, AND IF IT

50
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,516
DIDN'T, PLANNING WOULD PREVAIL

51
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:53,685
AND SOCIALISM WOULD WORK.

52
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:56,822
CREATIVITY IS THE FOUNDATION OF

53
00:01:56,823 --> 00:01:57,256
CAPITALISM.

54
00:01:57,257 --> 00:02:00,392
AND THIS IS -- AND SOCIALISM IS

55
00:02:00,393 --> 00:02:01,827
BASED ON PLANNING.

56
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:04,763
IT'S BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION

57
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:07,799
THAT WE'D ALREADY KNOW ALL WE

58
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,969
NEED TO KNOW IN ORDER TO PLAN

59
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,307
OUR FUTURE, AND SO IT LEADS TO

60
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:17,576
TYRANNY, AND THAT'S REALLY THE

61
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:17,976
DIFFERENCE.

62
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:19,912
LIBERTY VERSUS TYRANNY AS

63
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:21,847
SOMEONE ONCE PUT IT.

64
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:23,615
MARK: ISN'T THIS THE GENERAL

65
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,217
PROBLEM WITH PROGRESSIVISM,

66
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:26,485
ACROSS THE BOARD.

67
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:27,786
THAT IS THEY THINK THEY KNOW

68
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:29,788
ALL THEY NEED TO KNOW, AND NOW

69
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:31,590
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

70
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:32,991
REDISTRIBUTING IDEAS,

71
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:35,194
REDISTRIBUTING WEALTH,

72
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:35,661
REDISTRIBUTING.

73
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:36,628
ISN'T THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM,

74
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,363
THAT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE TO

75
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:39,231
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE FUTURE IS

76
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,300
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO

77
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:41,700
UNDERSTAND.

78
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:44,770
>> THE FUTURE IS UNPREDICTABLE

79
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:47,039
AND IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH IT

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,375
SUCCESSFULLY, YOU'LL HAVE TO

81
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:52,344
LEARN, AND LEARNING HAS A LOT

82
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:54,780
OF CONSTRAINTS.

83
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:57,449
ECONOMIC GROWTH IS THE INCREASE

84
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,352
OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE INCREASE

85
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:02,354
OF KNOWLEDGE IS LEARNING, AND

86
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:05,090
THE MOST WIDELY DOCUMENTED

87
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:06,925
PHENOMENON IN ALL BUSINESS IS

88
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:09,428
CALLED THE LEARNING CURVE, WITH

89
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:10,862
EVERY DOUBLING OF TOTAL SALES,

90
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:14,533
YOU GET A 20-30% DROP IN PRICES

91
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:17,569
OR IN COSTS.

92
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,373
AND THIS DROP IN COSTS IS

93
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:25,644
EVIDENT ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES.

94
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:26,645
DOCUMENTED BY -- OF THE BAIN

95
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:28,513
AND COMPANY AND THE BOSTON

96
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:31,750
CONSULTING GROUP AND ALL THESE

97
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:34,586
LEARNING CURVE-BASE

98
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:35,053
CONSULTANCIES.

99
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:36,054
LEARNING IS THE HEART OF

100
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:36,455
CAPITALISM.

101
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:37,856
LEARNING IS FINDING OUT THINGS

102
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:39,825
YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW.

103
00:03:39,826 --> 00:03:44,529
AND THAT DEPENDS ON OPENNESS TO

104
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,033
CREATIVITY, TO SURPRISE, AND

105
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:51,770
SURPRISE IS REALLY CRUCIAL TO

106
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:52,170
CAPITALISM.

107
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:57,309
YOU CAN'T PREDICT PRODUCTS OF A

108
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:57,943
REALLY CREATIVE PROCESS.

109
00:03:57,944 --> 00:03:59,111
MARK: SO WHEN THE GOVERNMENT

110
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:02,247
GETS IN THE BUSINESS OF

111
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:04,549
REGULATING THAT, OF

112
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,652
REDISTRIBUTING WEALTH, OF

113
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:08,987
PUNISHING SOME BUSINESSES,

114
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:11,089
SUBSIDIZING OTHER BUSINESSES,

115
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,924
AM I CORRECT IN HEARING WHAT

116
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:16,295
YOU'RE SAYING IS IT'S AN ATTACK

117
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:21,333
ON MANY THINGS BUT ESPECIALLY

118
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:21,700
KNOWLEDGE.

119
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:23,802
>> IF YOU -- A GOVERNMENT

120
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:26,838
GUARANTEE PROHIBITS LEARNING

121
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,008
AND THUS PROHIBITS ECONOMIC

122
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:30,342
GROWTH.

123
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:32,110
ALL ECONOMIC GROWTH IS

124
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:35,113
FUNDAMENTALLY LEARNING.

125
00:04:35,114 --> 00:04:38,850
ALL WEALTH IS FUNDAMENTALLY

126
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:41,420
KNOWLEDGE, AS THOMAS SOLE

127
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:43,922
OBSERVED, THE NEANDERTHAL IN

128
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:46,525
HIS CAVE HAD ALL THE PHYSICAL

129
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:48,093
RESOURCES WE HAVE TODAY.

130
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:50,228
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR AGE

131
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:53,231
AND THE STONE AGE IS ENTIRELY

132
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:55,334
THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE, AND

133
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:58,337
THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE IS

134
00:04:58,338 --> 00:04:59,738
LEARNING, AND THAT MEANS

135
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:02,307
ECONOMIC GROWTH IS PRIMARILY

136
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:05,644
LEARNING, AND LEARNING CAN'T BE

137
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:06,044
GUARANTEED.

138
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:09,314
LEARNING IS FINDING OUT THINGS

139
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:11,817
YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW.

140
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:15,020
SO ANY GUARANTEE PROHIBITS

141
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:17,089
LEARNING, AND THUS PROHIBITS

142
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,422
GROWTH.

143
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:19,524
MARK: IS NOT THE GRAND IRONY,

144
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:21,760
THEN, THAT THE PROGRESSIVE

145
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:24,963
MIND-SET CLAIMS THAT THEIR

146
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:28,033
DECISIONS ARE BASED ON SCIENCE

147
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:30,836
AND KNOWLEDGE, WHEN, IN FACT,

148
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:32,571
IT'S NOT BASED ON SCIENCE OR

149
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:35,140
KNOWLEDGE, IT'S BASED ON

150
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:35,540
IDEOLOGY?

151
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:39,444
>> DEFINITELY BASED ON

152
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:42,247
DOCTRINE, AND DOGMA.

153
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:44,483
IT'S REALLY -- IN MY NEW BOOK

154
00:05:44,484 --> 00:05:47,319
LIFE AFTER GOOGLE, I DO A

155
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,323
CRITICISM OF WHAT I CALL GOOGLE

156
00:05:51,324 --> 00:05:51,656
MARXISM.

157
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:54,226
MARK: WHAT IS GOOGLE MARXISM.

158
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:57,396
>> MARX, HIS GREAT ERROR, REAL

159
00:05:57,397 --> 00:05:58,296
MISTAKE, WAS TO IMAGINE THAT

160
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:00,065
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION OF

161
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:03,201
THE 19th CENTURY, ALL THOSE

162
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:08,740
RAILWAYS AND DARK SATANIC MILLS

163
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:10,876
AND TURBINES AND THE BEGINNING

164
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:12,778
OF ELECTRICITY REPRESENTED THE

165
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,814
FINAL HUMAN ACHIEVEMENT IN

166
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:16,248
PRODUCTIVITY.

167
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:17,749
SO IN THE FUTURE, WHAT WOULD

168
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,051
MATTER IS NOT THE CREATION OF

169
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:23,221
WEALTH BUT THE REDISTRIBUTION

170
00:06:23,222 --> 00:06:24,423
OF WEALTH.

171
00:06:24,424 --> 00:06:27,592
GOOGLE COMES BACK TODAY AND

172
00:06:27,593 --> 00:06:30,529
SAYS THAT IT'S SEARCH ENGINES,

173
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,731
IT'S MACHINE LEARNING, IT'S

174
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:34,900
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, IT'S

175
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:37,335
ROBOTICS, IT'S BIOTECH.

176
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:41,873
IT'S THE ULTIMATE HUMAN

177
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:42,941
ATTAINMENT, AND IN THE FUTURE,

178
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:46,144
MOST OF US WILL BE ABLE TO

179
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:51,316
RETIRE, TO BEACHES WHILE SERGEI

180
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:53,485
BRYNN AND LARRY PAGE OF GOOGLE

181
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:55,620
FLY OFF TO REMOTE PLANETS WITH

182
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:59,391
ELON MUSK IN A WINNER-TAKE-ALL

183
00:06:59,392 --> 00:06:59,791
UNIVERSE.

184
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:03,261
AND THIS IS A BELIEF THAT BILL

185
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:08,600
BUCKLEY USED TO CALL

186
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:12,070
IMMINENTIZING THE ESKATON,

187
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:15,707
FINAL THINGS, FINAL DAYS, AND

188
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:19,511
EACH GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGIES

189
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:20,545
IMAGINE THEIR TECHNOLOGICAL

190
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:22,547
VISION, WHETHER IT'S RAILROADS

191
00:07:22,548 --> 00:07:25,717
OR SPACEFLIGHT OR ARTIFICIAL

192
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:28,820
INTELLIGENCE IS THE FINAL

193
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:30,155
ATTAINMENT, AND THIS IS REALLY

194
00:07:30,156 --> 00:07:31,990
WHAT SOCIALISM IS ABOUT.

195
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:33,925
IT'S ABOUT SAYING THAT WHAT WE

196
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:36,695
HAVE NOW IS ALL WE'RE GOING TO

197
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:38,163
GET, THAT WE KNOW AS MUCH AS WE

198
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:42,501
NEED TO KNOW TO PLAN THE ENTIRE

199
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:43,401
FUTURE, AND THAT IS

200
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:48,773
FUNDAMENTALLY HOSTILE TO HUMAN

201
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:49,174
CREATIVITY.

202
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:50,609
MARK: THIS MIND-SET, THIS

203
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,611
GOOGLE MARXISM, IT CUTS ACROSS

204
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:55,213
ALL THESE PLATFORMS OR DOES IT?

205
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:56,848
FACEBOOK, TWITTER, HOW ABOUT

206
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,416
THE SILICON VALLEY?

207
00:07:58,417 --> 00:07:59,651
YOU'VE REFERENCED THAT IN THE

208
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:03,655
PAST AS, I THINK, SILICON

209
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:06,758
VALLEY MARXISM, ISN'T THAT

210
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,225
RIGHT?

211
00:08:07,226 --> 00:08:09,394
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF

212
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:11,029
PHILOSOPHERS AND PHILOSOPHER

213
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,130
KINGS IN SILICON VALLEY.

214
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:14,566
AND WHEN THEY PRONOUNCE ON

215
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:18,336
PUBLIC ISSUES, THEY IMAGINE

216
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:23,475
THAT THEIR TECHNOLOGY IS AN

217
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:26,311
ESCATTON, AN ULTIMATE THING AND

218
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:29,347
USURPS HUMAN MINDS.

219
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:33,118
MY FRIEND RAY KERSWHILE

220
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:35,120
INTRODUCED THE CONCEPT OF

221
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:37,689
SINGULARITY, THE MOMENT WHEN

222
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,723
OUR COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY WOULD

223
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:41,826
EXCEED HUMAN MINDS ON ALL

224
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:45,030
DIMENSIONS, AND AT THAT POINT,

225
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:46,464
THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD PRODUCE

226
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:49,768
NEW MACHINES IN A CASCADE OF

227
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:51,836
INVENTIONS THAT LEAVE HUMANS

228
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:52,704
FAR BEHIND.

229
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:53,705
MARK: IS THAT POSSIBLE?

230
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:55,206
>> NO.

231
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:57,008
MARK: WHY?

232
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:00,145
>> BECAUSE THIS ARTIFICIAL

233
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:02,147
INTELLIGENCE IS A MACHINE.

234
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:04,583
AND REMEMBER, I STRESSED

235
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:05,183
SURPRISE.

236
00:09:05,184 --> 00:09:06,618
MACHINES, IF MACHINES SURPRISED

237
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:11,222
YOU, THEY PROBABLY BREAKING

238
00:09:11,223 --> 00:09:11,856
DOWN.

239
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:15,226
MACHINES ARE REALLY

240
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:17,862
DETERMINISTIC ALMOST BY

241
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:19,497
DEFINITION, AND DETERMINISM IN

242
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:22,500
INFORMATION THEORY, WHICH

243
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,970
UNDERLIES ALL OF SILICON

244
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:26,404
VALLEY, INFORMATION IS WHAT'S

245
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:29,341
NOT DETERMINED BY THE MACHINE.

246
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:32,077
INFORMATION IS THE CREATIVITY

247
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:33,078
OF CAPITALISM.

248
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:35,547
MARK: SO MACHINES HAVE MASTERS

249
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:37,048
CALLED HUMAN BEINGS.

250
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:42,887
>> MACHINES HAVE MASTERS.

251
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:45,390
CURT GIRDLE PROVED IN 1951 THAT

252
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:47,592
ANY LOGICAL SCHEME, INCLUDING A

253
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:50,662
COMPUTER, ANYTHING, IS

254
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:53,932
NECESSARILY DEPENDENT UPON

255
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,534
AXIOMS OUTSIDE THE BOX.

256
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:58,370
WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOX IS THE

257
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:02,173
MACHINE, BUT ANY MACHINE IS

258
00:10:02,174 --> 00:10:05,844
NECESSARILY DEPENDENT ON WHAT

259
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:09,481
ALAN TURIN CALLED AN ORACLE.

260
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:13,752
A SOURCE OF CREATIVITY,

261
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:15,720
SURPRISE, OUTSIDE THE BOX.

262
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:17,756
MARK: CAN MACHINES HAVE

263
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:18,156
JUDGMENT?

264
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:22,093
>> NO, NOT REALLY.

265
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:25,764
THEY CAN REPEAT OR IMITATE

266
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:26,965
PROCESSES OF JUDGMENT SUPPLIED

267
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:31,302
TO THEM BY HUMAN BEINGS, BUT

268
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:33,905
EVERY SYMBOL THAT'S EMPLOYED IN

269
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:36,207
THE MACHINE HAS TO BE DEFINED

270
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:40,111
BY A HUMAN INTERPRETER, AND SO,

271
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:41,780
SO THE WHOLE IDEA THAT THESE

272
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:44,349
MACHINES SHUFFLING SYMBOLS

273
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,419
ACTUALLY HAVE MEANING WITHOUT

274
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,655
HUMAN PROVIDERS IS ITSELF

275
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:51,589
DELUSIONAL, AND I THINK IT'S

276
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,226
REALLY IRONIC THAT ALL THESE

277
00:10:55,227 --> 00:10:56,428
BRILLIANT COMPUTER SCIENTISTS

278
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,296
OF SILICON VALLEY HAVE LOST

279
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:01,700
TRAFFIC THE VERY ESSENCE OF

280
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:02,967
THEIR SCIENCE.

281
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:07,205
THE ESSENCE OF THEIR SCIENCE

282
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:11,142
WAS BEGUN BY TURIN AND GERTEL

283
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:13,611
AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

284
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:15,613
REFUTED THESE ORIGINAL INSIGHTS

285
00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:17,215
WHICH NECESSARILY MAKE

286
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:20,985
COMPUTERS DEPENDENT ON HUMAN

287
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:21,319
INPUTS.

288
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,120
MARK: SO IF WE UNDERSTAND

289
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:23,788
TECHNOLOGY, MACROTECHNOLOGY, WE

290
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:27,592
HAVE REALLY NOTHING TO FEAR, DO

291
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:27,926
WE?

292
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:29,794
>> NO, THIS IS JUST CONTINUED

293
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:31,663
EVOLUTION OF THE ECONOMY.

294
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:34,099
IT'S NOT AS BIG A CHANGE AT ALL

295
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,901
AS BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND

296
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:39,237
FACTORIES IN THE 19th CENTURY.

INTRODUCTION OF ROBOTICS, WHICH

303
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:55,754
IS JUST KIND OF AN EXTENSION OF

304
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:58,790
ALL THE EXISTING ROBOTS THAT

305
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:02,026
ARE -- RUN OUR EXISTING

00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:02,393
FACTORIES.

307
00:12:02,394 --> 00:12:05,029
IT JUST -- AND -- BUT, ON THE

308
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,066
OTHER HAND, IT ISN'T -- IT IS

309
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:09,734
EXCITING, THESE NEW MACHINES

310
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:12,637
THAT ARE BEING GENERATED, AND

311
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:17,342
THEY WILL, LIKE ALL PREVIOUS

312
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:19,077
MACHINES INCREASE EMPLOYMENT.

313
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:22,313
HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT EMPLOYED

314
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:24,015
BECAUSE THEY'RE UNPRODUCTIVE.

315
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:27,085
THEY'RE EMPLOYED BECAUSE THEY

316
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:28,653
ARE PRODUCTIVE.

317
00:12:28,654 --> 00:12:30,922
AND SO MACHINES THAT RENDER

318
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:35,226
HUMAN BEINGS MORE PRODUCTIVE

319
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:40,131
RENDER THEM MORE EMPLOYABLE,

320
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:41,566
NOT LESS EMPLOYABLE.

321
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:44,135
THE FALLACY THAT THE A.I. IS

322
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:45,336
