so what's the latest thing to get renamed due to the tear near political correctness would you believe a brand of snot rags just in case I happen to tear up I have my favorite tissue on standby Kleenex ultra soft even though once this box is depleted I don't think I'll be buying any more Kleenex products on a matter of principle you see the parent company of Kleenex Kimberly Clark has demonstrated that it has a backbone that's about as firm as well a wet Kleenex here's the deal in certain markets Kleenex sells an extra large variety of tissues called man-size it's been doing so for 60 years now but what was considered Jim Dandy in 1958 is today considered offensive and deeply sexist and blah blah blah blah blah I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that the original idea of calling extra-large tissues man-sized is because on average more or less males tend to be bigger than females if you have an issue with the size disparity folks please take that up with the man upstairs yet because we live in a society of the perpetually offended the newest caused as your is yes men's size Kleenex you know I think the worst part of kimberly-clark caving into the lunatic fringe is their statement regarding the alleged sexism of their tissues here's what Kimberly Clark said to Britain's Daily Telegraph namely that man size in no way suggests that both soft and strong was an exclusively masculine trait nor do we believe that the man size branding suggests or endorses gender inequality now the thing is that statement was on point and logical and then the company nevertheless acquiesced to the two or three people in the universe who lodged complaints and promptly name their man-sized tissue as extra-large hopefully nobody from the morbidly obese community complains but talk about mixed messages isn't the preferred template for a modern-day man supposed to be someone who's both soft and strong you know a whole lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger plus a little bit of Alan Alda a hybrid man one who's both macho and sensitive the kind of guy who can fix a flat tire no problem but will also shed a tear at the appropriate time like at the ending of Thelma & Louise so if this soft strong dude isn't the ideal man then who is yet the renaming is being hailed by Sam Smith she heads up a feminist group called the Fawcett Society quote rebranding man-sized tissues is not to be sneezed at removing sexist branding such as this is just sensible 21st century marketing but we still have a long way to go before using lazy stereotypes to sell products is a thing of the past hmm a long way to go eh so this is what passes for feminism these days looking for sexist brands to rename while turning a blind eye to oh I don't know female genital mutilation because campaigning against something like that might be a little culturally insensitive to certain people anywho I got to thinking what other products are now running afoul of the PC language police well how about this one Swanson hungry man dinner shouldn't that be hungry person dinner he who biased bastards and hey what about this Milano giant ladyfingers now how non-inclusive is this folks a giant ladyfinger not only discriminates against men but against small and medium sized ladies too right and finally there's this fisherman's friend cough drops I mean are you kidding me Fisher man did we not learn anything from Francesco sir Barra the Liberal MP for von Woodbridge recently on a family vacation of Boston at a conversation with someone who would love their fisherman wouldn't Fisher folks would love to have access to Europe like our Canadian fishermen do fisherfolks new excuse me that's right it's Fisher folks friend from now on okay sure Fisher folks is a made-up word that nobody uses but it is gender-neutral as for me enough is enough which is to say Kleenex it was nice blowing you from now on it's this Scotties little snot ease for my extra-large nose until I suppose the inevitable happens and the SJW said complain that Scotty is just a wee bit too Eurocentric for their liking for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's eyed Menzies hey folks the Breville has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you travel you
