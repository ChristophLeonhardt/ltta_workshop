00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
magicians of many artists still there

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,440
very good observers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of human behavior</font>

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:15,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of human perception and one of the</font>

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,690
main ways in which magicians are able to

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,689
manipulate their attention is basically

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,779
by getting us to multi-touch

7
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:26,939
multitasking is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mess we may seem that</font>

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,590
we're able to do several things at once

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,260
but the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that when we are</font>

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,960
dividing our attention we become<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,390
less<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective than if you were to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,879
just a single task at once at a time so

13
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,280
magicians take this divide<font color="#CCCCCC"> and conquer</font>

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,410
approach with attention typically

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,829
they're going to ask you to divide your

16
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,440
attention in many different locations

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,960
from space or even they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,940
generate an internal dialogue so that

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,440
you're having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conversation with</font>

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,809
yourself instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your head what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

21
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,510
happening is what was the situation

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,909
right now and what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving your</font>

23
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,580
attention inward or you're allocating it

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,729
in competing places you become a lot

25
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">less effective finding out the secret</font>

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:00:00,000
behind the magical effect
