when you look at things in hindsight like this decisions like that seem very easy of course I did this and so forth I was actually an intern at CNN Business News a hundred years ago Lou Dobbs is not an intimidating man and here he is saying you know you have this path to glory he's promoting you everything else the other thing I know from TV is that people are pigeon-holed it immediately that jump is often ridiculed from the production side people dream of that how could you do it so talk through that a little bit more was it that you had nothing to lose I think it was just that you know I I wanted to love what I do and I was loving what I mean this is what I wrote about in the book you must love what you do and you and the first law of my ten laws of enduring success is self-knowledge you need to understand and really know yourself and know what you can do and know where your heart is and what you love to do because I think in order to be successful you have to love what you do you have to wake up with a fire in your belly and just want to go at it that's the only way you'll be able to work really hard at it and I've had found what I was good at and what I love doing and that was being in the field interviewing people meeting people I was developing a great rolodex and you know I just I loved putting pieces together I didn't have any interest in going on the air I didn't even want to go on the air I loved my position as assignment editor I was you know coming up with story ideas writing the script and then handing it off to someone on camera who had presented but when he took me out of that role and and put me as a producer which was a higher position it took me out of the field and that means I was at my desk all day I was in the control room I was gonna be in the IFB and someone else's ear just putting a show together one hour show as opposed to being in the field and I had the courage thankfully to say to myself you know why I've done this and I know this is not what I love I know what I love it's being in the field it's learning new things every day meeting new people every day and building a great rolodex that when I have a story I do and I have a an issue in business I know exactly who to call and when he took me out of that I knew I needed to make a change and were you thinking at that point one of the most famous financial journalists in the world and ten years are you thinking I don't want to get fired I'm gonna go do my job and see how it works out you know I wasn't I wasn't thinking that much no I definitely did not have aspirations to become you know a leading financial journalist that's wasn't in my plan at all I just wanted to be happy in what I was doing it definitely took guts in retrospect because I had a great set up I was working at Turner Broadcasting for CNN you know during the Gulf War the first Gulf War it was exciting as heck and I loved what I was doing but as soon as I was taken out of the role that I loved so much and put in another role I was upset and I was crying and I remember thinking to myself this is not what I want to do and then I thought you know the only thing I can do at this point for my career is to try to be on camera because I've done all of these other jobs at CNN Business News so I've sort of hit a ceiling and so I figured I'm 25 what you know if it doesn't work out I'll hopefully bounce back and figure it out another way and did you ever have to bounce back along the way or was it just an incredible rocket ride to the top well you know I I would like to I'm trying to be as humble as I can it was an incredible rocket ride it really has
