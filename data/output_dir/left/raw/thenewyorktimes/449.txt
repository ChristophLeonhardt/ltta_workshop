00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:27,714
Here we are at AeroFarms. This is our ninth farm and 
the largest vertical farm in the world.

2
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:33,060
We define vertical farming as layer upon layer of plant growth.

00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:41,484
What we could grow in one acre, it takes a 130
acres to grow in the field.

4
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:47,384
We use 95 percent less water to grow a plant,
zero pesticides, herbicides, fungicides.

5
00:00:47,384 --> 00:00:53,784
We are building AeroFarms with the purpose 
of having a strong impact on the community we live in

6
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:55,524
as well as the environment.

7
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:00,000
Also, we're helping alleviate a food desert 
right here in the city of Newark.
