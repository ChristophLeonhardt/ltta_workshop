>> Trace: BACK TO FOX'S TOP
STORY.
THE US AND NORTH KOREA HOPE TO
GET PEACE TALKS BACK ON TRACK.
LET'S BRING IN JAMES JEFFERIES,
FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY
ADVISER TO GEORGE W. BUSH.
HE HELPED SUPERVISE THE LAST
NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.
THANKS FOR JOINING US, SIR.
I KNOW YOU'RE THE EXPERT HERE
BUT THIS FEELS MORE LIKE A
NEGOTIATION MORE THAN A
CANCELLATION.
YOUR TAKE?
>> EXACTLY.
FIRST OF ALL, THE STRONG
RHETORIC OUT OF NORTH KOREA WAS
NOT FROM KIM JONG-UN, THE LEADER
BUT ONE OF HIS SUBORDINATES.
IT WAS AIMED AT JOHN BOLTON.
THAT'S ONE SIGN.
BUT THE MORE SERIOUS SIGN AS
SECRETARY POMPEO POINTED OUT,
THE LACK OF RESPONSE FROM THE
NORTH KOREANS ABOUT SETTING UP
THE SUMMIT.
'S DONE 12 -- HELPED DO 12 FOR
FOUR PRESIDENTS.
YOU DON'T INTO THIS WITHOUT
KNOWING THE DETAILS.
THE NORTH KOREANS WERE SENDING A
SIGNAL THEY WEREN'T READY.
>> AND THERE SEEMED TO BE A
CHANGE IN TONE, AMBASSADOR, THE
SECOND TIME THAT KIM JONG-UN MET
WITH PRESIDENT XI IN CHINA.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THAT?
MAYBE YOU CAN GET MORE OUT OF
THIS IF YOU PUT MORE PRESSURE ON
PRESIDENT TRUMP?
>> THAT'S POSSIBLY THE CASE.
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS VISIT
TO BEIJING.
BUT WE SHOULDN'T ASSUME THAT
CHINA WANTS THIS WHOLE CRISIS
WITH NORTH KOREA END.
IT TIES DOWN MOST OF OUR FORCES
IN THE FAR EAST RATHER THAN
FOCUSING ON CHINA AND THE SOUTH
CHINA SEA AND MAKES CHINA AN
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MAYER.
WITHOUT CHINA, ECONOMIC
SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA WON'T
BE EFFECTIVE.
CHINA MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT A
WARMING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE
U.S., SOUTH KOREA AND NORTH
KOREA AND MAY HAVE PUT THE
BRAKES ON THEMSELVES VIA THE
NORTH KOREANS.
>> BEEN A LOT OF COVERAGE TODAY,
AMBASSADOR, ABOUT NORTH KOREA.
TAKING JOURNALISTS TO THE
NUCLEAR FACILITY AND BLOWING IT
UP.
THERE SEEMS TO BE A BIG
DIFFERENCE IN THE DEFINITION OF
DENUCLEARIZATION BETWEEN NORTH
KOREA AND THE UNITED STATES.
>> EXACTLY.
THE NORTH KOREANS WHO YOU'LL
REMEMBER IN THE MEETING WITH
PRESIDENT MOON A MONTH AGO
SIGNED UP TO A DOCUMENT THAT
SAYS COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION
OF THE PENINSULA.
BUT THEY TAKE THE NORTH KOREANS
DEFINITION THAT WOULD INCLUDE
U.S. FORCES THAT ARE BACKED BY
NUCLEAR FORCES AND VARIOUS OTHER
ARGUMENTS.
THE POINT IS, THE U.S. HAS TO
INSIST ON DENUCLEARIZATION.
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID IN TALKING
ABOUT THIS, THIS CAN BE A STEP
BY STEP PROCESS.
IN FACT, THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO
DO IT.
THE U.S. HAS TO KEEP UP THEIR
SIDE OR THIS WON'T GO FAR.
>> Trace: WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE
RIGHT NOW?
WHAT IS THE TIME FOR A COOLING
OFF?
WE KEEP TALKING TO THE NORTH
KOREANS AND THE SOUTH KOREANS
AND THE JAPANESE AND THE CHINESE
TO MAKE THIS WHOLE THING COME
TOGETHER AT SOME POINT IN TIME.
>> WE KEEP TALKING WITH OUR
ALLIES.
THERE'S SOME INDICATION THAT
THEY MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT
THE CHANGE.
THERE'S A CHANCE TO MAKE
PROGRESS.
KIM JONG-UN WANTS THIS OR HE
WOULDN'T HAVE RELEASED THE
PRISONERS
PRISONER
PRISONERS.
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT TO HAVE
PULLED OUT.
BUT THE PRESIDENT KEPT THE DOOR
OPEN.
THAT'S A VERY SMART WAY TO GO
FORWARD AT THIS POINT.
I THINK WE SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE
SEEING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
