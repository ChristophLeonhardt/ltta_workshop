HISTORIC CAREER.

5
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:09,054
ABBY: WHAT A CAREER SHE HAS HAD.

6
00:00:09,054 --> 00:00:10,856

AMERICAN STUDENTS GRADUATE

10
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:14,192
SCHOOL WITH A SENSE OF

11
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:16,328
ENTITLEMENT AND THE BEST WAY TO

12
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:18,196
FIGHT THAT IS WITH MANDATORY

13
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:19,765
MILITARY SERVICE.

14
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:21,700
GRIFF: OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS

15
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,734
STUDENTS, QUOTE, NEED TO BE

16
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:23,835
TAUGHT THAT THE WORLD OWES THEM

17
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:25,370
NOTHING, THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE

18
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,304
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR LIVES,

19
00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:27,339
AND I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER

20
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:29,775
WAY OF DOING THIS THAT

21
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:30,475
COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE

22
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:30,709
COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE.

23
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:31,443
PETE: THE AUTHOR OF THAT OP-ED

24
00:00:31,443 --> 00:00:34,045
IS ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE NEW

25
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:36,314
BOOK "THE REPUBLICAN WORKERS

26
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:36,648
PARTY."

27
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:38,183
FRANK BUCKLEY JOINS US NOW TO

28
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:38,550
EXPLAIN.

29
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,818
FRANK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

30
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:40,685
JOINING US THIS MORNING.

31
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:42,254
FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE YOUR

32
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:42,587
PREMISE.

33
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:43,388
I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING

34
00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:46,391
FROM ON THIS, BUT THEN THE

35
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:48,059
LOGISTICS OF A COUNTRY OF 300

36
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,963
MILLION PEOPLE GIVING ONE YEAR

37
00:00:51,963 --> 00:00:54,132
OF COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE,

38
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:57,903
WE SEE IT IN COUNTRIES LIKE

39
00:00:57,903 --> 00:00:59,137
ISRAEL THAT HAVE AN EXISTENTIAL

40
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:00,071
THREAT.

41
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:02,574
HOW WOULD YOU STOP IT FROM

42
00:01:02,574 --> 00:01:03,475
BALLOONING INTO A BEHEMOTH?

43
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:04,543
>> IT'S NOT JUST ISRAEL.

44
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:07,612
IT'S A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES AS

45
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:08,513
WELL, COUNTRIES THAT ARE FAIRLY

46
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:10,048
PACIFIC, AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

47
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:10,348
WAR.

48
00:01:10,348 --> 00:01:11,349
IT'S ABOUT REALLY ADDING AN

49
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:14,519
EXTRA YEAR OF EDUCATION.

50
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,120
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW IT'S

51
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,988
COMPULSORY EDUCATION, K TO 12, K

52
00:01:16,988 --> 00:01:19,758
TO AGE 16, AND I'M SAYING, OKAY,

53
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:22,260
WHAT IF WE ADDED ONE EXTRA YEAR?

54
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,529
BECAUSE WHAT THAT WOULD DO WOULD

55
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:26,765
BE TO TEACH OUR STUDENTS

56
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:27,532
SOMETHING THEY DON'T GET FROM

57
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:30,435
THEIR K-12 EDUCATION, WHICH IS A

58
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:33,205
SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY, A LOVE

59
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:35,373
OF THE COUNTRY, AND ALSO THE

60
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:37,242
IDEA THAT WE'RE ALL PART OF ONE

61
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:40,045
AMERICAN FAMILY, RIGHT?

62
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:41,613
I MEAN, ON MEMORIAL DAY, MAYBE

63
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:43,548
WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THE ONE

64
00:01:43,548 --> 00:01:46,952
THING WHICH REALLY SERVES TO

65
00:01:46,952 --> 00:01:47,886
UNIFY THE COUNTRY MORE THAN

66
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:48,620
ANYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN SERVICE

67
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,188
IN THE MILITARY.

68
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:51,356
PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY ARE --

69
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:52,858
HAVE BETTER VALUES AND A

70
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:54,626
STRONGER SENSE OF IDENTIFICATION

71
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:55,126
WITH THE COUNTRY.

72
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:59,764
AND ONE EXTRA YEAR OF

73
00:01:59,764 --> 00:02:00,832
EFFECTIVELY SCHOOLING IN THE

74
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,567
MILITARY WOULD NOT BE A BAD IDEA

75
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:02,801
THEN

76
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:03,034
THEN.

77
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:03,735
ABBY: LET'S GET BACK TO THE

78
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:04,469
ORIGINAL PROBLEM AND WHY YOU

79
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,972
WANTED TO WRITE THIS PIECE

80
00:02:06,972 --> 00:02:07,639
BECAUSE YOU SAY OTHER THAN

81
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,473
EDUCATION BEING THERE TO INFORM

82
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:10,775
PEOPLE AND EDUCATE THEM YOU SAY

83
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:12,577
IT WAS SUPPOSED INSTILL A LOVE

84
00:02:12,577 --> 00:02:14,112
OF OUR COUNTRY, YOU TALKED ABOUT

85
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:15,380
UNITE US TO BRING PEOPLE OF

86
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,549
EVERY RACE AND EVERY CLASS

87
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:17,916
TOGETHER.

88
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,184
YOU SAY EDUCATION IS NOT DOING

89
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:20,185
THAT SO TALK TO US ABOUT THE

90
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:22,254
ROOT OF THE PROBLEM AND IF IT

91
00:02:22,254 --> 00:02:24,789
ISN'T A DRAFT, BECAUSE THE

92
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:25,690
REALITY IS WE DON'T HAVE A DRAFT

93
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,859
WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO THAT

94
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:28,260
PROBLEM?

95
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,960
>> PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE SUPPOSED

96
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,694
TO DO A COUPLE THINGS.

97
00:02:29,694 --> 00:02:31,329
ONE IS EDUCATE OR KIDS.

98
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,598
THEY DON'T DO THAT VERY WELL.

99
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:34,699
I MEAN, WE'RE AN HONORARY MEMBER

100
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:35,700
OF THE THIRD WORLD AS FAR AS

101
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,904
THAT GOES, BUT THE OTHER STUFF

102
00:02:38,904 --> 00:02:40,705
IS THE STUFF THAT THEY USED TO

103
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:40,972
DO.

104
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:41,673
PUBLIC SCHOOL USED TO BE THE

105
00:02:41,673 --> 00:02:43,208
MOST AMERICAN THING ABOUT

106
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:43,541
AMERICA.

107
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,143
AND YOU'D GET OUT OF PUBLIC

108
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:49,447
SCHOOL LEARNING SOME PRETTY GOOD

109
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:49,781
VALUES.

110
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:51,316
AND NOW, THE TEACHING CORPS HAS

111
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:52,250
COMPLETELY ABANDONED THAT

112
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,184
MISSION.

113
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:55,387
WHERE YOU WOULD FIND IT WOULD BE

114
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:56,955
IN THE MILITARY.

115
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:59,257
SO I'M SAYING ONE EXTRA YEAR,

116
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:01,693
YOU KNOW, UP TO NOW IT'S AGE,

117
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:04,162
YOU KNOW, -- TO AGE 16, ADD

118
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:05,130
ANOTHER NEAR.

119
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,665
GRIFF: FRANK, IT'S A GREAT IDEA

120
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:08,500
AND, YOU KNOW, TO REALLY TEACH

121
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,267
THOSE WHO HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED

122
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,136
IN THE SERVICE WHAT IT'S ALL

123
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:12,604
ABOUT WOULD BE GREAT.

124
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:14,205
BUT DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE WITH

125
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:15,140
THE CULTURE OF OUR PUBLIC

126
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,474
SCHOOLS TODAY, THAT YOU'RE GOING

127
00:03:16,474 --> 00:03:18,209
TO HAVE THESE TEACHERS,

128
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,445
PARTICULARLY IN THE LATTER YEARS

129
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:22,314
ENCOURAGING THEIR STUDENTS TO

130
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:24,115
REALLY GET FIRED UP TO GO SERVE

131
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:25,717
THEIR NATION IN THE HISTORY IN

132
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:26,952
THIS CULTURE?

133
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:28,853
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

134
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:33,792
AND THAT'S THE POINT.

135
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:34,559
THE TEACHER CORPS, YOU KNOW, THE

136
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:35,293
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION

137
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:36,061
WILL BE COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO

138
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:36,628
THAT.

139
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:36,928
WHY?

140
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:38,830
BECAUSE IT WOULD TEACH A LOVE OF

141
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,065
AMERICA, IT WOULD TEACH PERSONAL

142
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:40,799
RESPONSIBILITY, ALL THE THINGS

143
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,967
THEY HATE.

144
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,601
SO, YEAH, ALL THE MORE REASON

145
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:44,836
WHY WE SHOULD DO IT.

146
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:46,304
THE ONLY PEOPLE I FEEL SORRY

147
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,141
ABOUT FOR IN ALL OF THIS WOULD

148
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:50,976
BE THE DRILL INSTRUCTORS.

149
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:51,343
[LAUGHTER]

150
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:52,877
PETE: YOU AND ME BOTH.

151
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:54,779
GO TO BASIC TRAINING, BASIC

152
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:55,680
MILITARY SERVICE NEAR WHERE THEY

153
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,148
LIVE, IS THAT THE CONCEPT?

154
00:03:57,148 --> 00:04:00,051
>> THAT'S DREADED BASICALLY, ONE

155
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:00,952
EXTRA YEAR

156
00:04:00,952 --> 00:04:01,186
EXTRA YEAR.

157
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:03,822
PETE: ONE X-RAY YEAR, INFUSE

158
00:04:03,822 --> 00:04:04,522
VALUES THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE

159
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:04,990
NOT DOING NOW.

160
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,091
ABBY: IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

161
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:07,225
JOIN THE MILITARY, GET TO KNOW

162
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:08,293
THESE MEN AND WOMEN, BECAUSE AS

163
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:09,027
YOU SAID THEY ARE OUTSTANDING

164
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:09,761
INDIVIDUALS AND THEY ARE WHAT

165
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,396
MAKES THIS COUNTRY SO GREAT.

166
00:04:11,396 --> 00:00:00,000
