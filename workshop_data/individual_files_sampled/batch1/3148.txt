Michael Newman here with us today from a fight sports and entertainment he's also an advocate professor at Columbia Michael is Tiger going to be tainted forever I was this going to blow over and as soon as the pga tourney starts well i think he'll forever be associated with this scandal but over time it's going to lessen like it has with other athletes and celebrities that have associated themselves with scandals that have happened you know Kobe Bryant's history michael vick is not in the news anymore exactly i think the most important thing right now is he has to take a position and be accountable for what happened and put himself in the public eye and make a statement and then lay low come back to the tour in 2010 and get back to doing what he's very good at and that's winning golf tournament and i think when he starts winning and he starts getting back into the into play i think a lot of this stuff is going to start to blow over so obviously he's made a public apology on his website do you think he needs to do more than that I mean this is like going on Oprah I absolutely think he needs to do more he does really need to take a position he needs to define himself he needs to let everybody know exactly how he's feeling and he is going to need some time away from from his fans and from the tour and also from from press as far as going on Oprah that's a possibility it really depends what his objectives are the one thing that I'm interested in learning is his PR and communications strategy I'm not really sure they still have a plan from what I heard they weren't quite sure exactly what information was still really out there so it's hard to create a strategy and a plan to really define yourself if you don't have all the facts well I mean their various I mean it's driven more traffic i think than michael jackson's death on yahoo so obviously the public is very interested there's a ton of stories out there I mean given what we have now what does he need to do and what is this time frame and I mean the PGA tournament starts or the tour starts in January what can you do from now until then well I think he needs to make a statement I think he needs to hold a press conference I think he needs to make a statement and I think he needs to not so much explain what he did but just come forward admit the mistakes and just ask everyone for some privacy now while he starts to work on rebuilding his image and potentially repairing this relationship with his wife I'm not really sure that he's going to be capable of doing that if you you know if you've read the newspapers a lot of the text messages and emails have talked about his level of unhappiness in his marriage that's got to be tough for his wife to hear of course in your opinion is it close to being the biggest or most publicized sports scandal well in my opinion a sports scandal is when the outcome impacts the game again so i look at the 1919 World Series I look at what major league baseball's dealing with right now with performance-enhancing drugs I think this is just shocking every single time someone else comes forward and announces a relationship with Tiger there's almost this shocked and awed reaction from the media and from fans if this were to happen to a neighbor of yours and we were to learn that this type of activity was happening and we had no idea what's happening I think we'd feel the same way this is all just heightened because we're talking about a curable iconic athlete like Tiger Woods great thank you you're welcome
