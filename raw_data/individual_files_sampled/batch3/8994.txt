♪ ♪ Laura: TODAY WE LEARNED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WILL REREESE THE REPORT ON THE DOJ AND THE FBI ONE WEEK FROM TODAY. THE IG WILL TESTIFY BEFORE THE SENATE ON THE 18th. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE REPORT WOULD COVER JUST THE FBI'S INVESTIGATION OF THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL SCANDAL BUT THE IG REPORT COULD BE MUCH BROADER. GRASSLEY TITLED IT EXAMINING THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S FIRST REPORT ON JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND FBI ACTION IN ADVANCE OF THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER. WITH DARRELL ISSA AND DANIEL GOLDMAN AND LEE SMITH. CONGRESSMAN, YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK ON THIS STUFF. WHAT GIVES? A BROADER REPORT? WHY WOULD GRASSLEY TITLE IT LIKE THAT? FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE MICHAEL HOROWITZ HAS BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND DONE A LOT OF INVESTIGATIONS OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN A PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION THAT WOULD NOT DEAL WITH THOSE PROBLEMS EVEN WITH REPORTED TO CONGRESS. HE WILL BE ASKED QUESTIONS WE KNOW FROM THE PAST HE CAN SPEAK ON. SECONDLY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INDEMIC MISCONDUCT OF COMEY INCLUDING THE APPLE SCANDAL WHERE HE CLAIMED YOU COULD NOT GET INFORMATION AND IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE TRUE OR HANDLING HILLARY CLINTON. IT GETS BROAD PRETTY QUICK. LOOKING AT OTHER DECISIONS INCLUDING THE FISA WARRANTS. Laura: LEE, LOTS OF THINGS ARE BUBBLING UP TO THE SURFACE. THIS LEAK YESTERDAY. TO SAY THAT COMEY WAS INSUBORDINATE IS THAT A BIG BOMBSHELL? MAYBE IT'S BEEN BUILT UP TOO MUCH. THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT TO COVER. THAT'S MAY ANSWER WITH SENATOR GRASSLEY TITLED THIS. THE PUBLIC IS KEEN AND KEEPS HEARING LEAKS AND THIS IS BEING PUSHED BACK AND THIS IS BEING BLOCKED. I THINK THEY ARE EITHER TO GET OUT A NUMBER OF THESE THINGS BEFORE IT INTERFERES TOO MUCH WITH THE ELECTION CYCLE. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES. Laura: ONE ISSUE THAT POPPED UPSHAW WITH PAPADOPOULOS. HIS WIFE SAID THEY WERE TRYING TO ENTRAP HIM AND USE HIM TO PUSH THIS INVESTIGATION FORWARD. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT? WELL, LEGALLY IT'S NOT ENTRAPMENT. IF THERE IS ANY INDICATION THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS WILLING TO DO WHATEVER THE CONDUCT IT. I THINK SHE IS USING ANOTHER DEFINITION OF ENTRAPMENT. GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS MADE SOME DRUNKEN COMMENT TO THE AUSTRALIANAMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. AND THAT SPURRED FURTHER CONVERSATIONS. Laura: INITIALLY IT WAS REPORTED THAT HE KNEW THERE WERE A LOT OF CLINTON EMAILS. THEN THEY BACKED OFF AND SAID THEY HAD DIRT ON HILLARY. THAT STORY SHIFTED. THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENT, SOMEONE HAS DIRT ON HILLARY AND SOMEONE KNEW EMAILS WERE HACKED AND WOULD BE RELEASED. HAVING SPENT 10 YEARS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND HAVING CASES REPORTED ON BY THE NEWS MEDIA, ABOUT 50% WAS RIGHT. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE JOURNALIST'S FAULT. SOMETIMES THE SOURCES ARE TOO FAR REMOVED. THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH AS THE INFORMATION AS YOU WOULD LIKE. LET'S NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. THERE WAS SOME INDICATION THAT PAPADOPOULOS NEW THAT RUSSIA HAD INFORMATION HE WAS TRYING TO GET ACCESS TO THAT. AT THAT POINT IT'S INCUMBENT ON THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE THAT TO SEE IF THERE IS A NATIONAL SECURITY RISK. Laura: YOU DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAPPENED BEFORE THAT PERIOD OF TIME? THE TEXT MESSAGES LOOKING AT TRUMP AND TALKING THE LURESED IN. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT. THAT ONE UNREDACTED TEXT. THAT'S WEIRD STUFF. MAYBE THAT'S INNOCENT. MAYBE THEY IS LURES ALL OVER THE PLACE. I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING FOR YOU ABOUT THE INFORMANTS. KEVIN WHO SUPERVISED THE REVITTING OF THE RULES FOR THE FBI JOINED US LAST WEEK. AN FBI CAN'T JUST OPEN A SOURCE AND GATHER INFORMATION. THEY HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE GUIDELINES. THE GUIDELINES ARE SPECIFIC IN COUNTER INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS AND WHEN YOU ARE DIRECTING YOUR SOURCE TOWARDS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. Laura: THE GUY WHO REWROTE THE RULES. WHEN YOU SAID IT'S INCUMBENT, THAT'S HOG WASH. THE FACT IS EVERY SINGLE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, THE SENATE, HOUSE, PRESIDENTIAL, THEY ARE ALL LOOKING FOR DIRT. THEY WANT IT WHEREVER THEY WILL GET. IT THEY PAY FOR IT. THEY HIRE ATTORNEYS. Laura: HILLARY PAID FOR THE DOSSIER. IF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE/FBI INVESTIGATED EVERY TIME THERE WAS A CREDIBLE ATTEMPT TO GET DIRT, YOU WOULD BE INVESTIGATING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS. COME ON. IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION IS A FOREIGN COUNTRY THAN IF THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION IS SOMEONE WITHIN THE COUNTRY. A VAGUE ALLEGATION THAT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WELL, WE HAVE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE. LET'S REMEMBER, IN THIS CASE. AT SOME POINT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE KNEW THAT THE DNC AND HILLARY CLINTON WERE PART OF THE SOURCE OF THAT. LONG BEFORE THE ELECTION. I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA THAT THE FBI IS RUNNING AN INVESTIGATION BASED ON WHAT A CAMPAIGN TEAM MEMBER SAID OVERHEARD IN A BAR. I THINK THAT'S PECULIAR. IF WE WENT TO A BAR AND HAD A CONVERSATION AND I AM ON A CAMPAIGN AND YOU ARE. THE FBI SAYS LET'S RUN AN INVESTIGATION ON THAT GUY, I THINK THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT. Laura: I SEE WHAT LEE IS SAYING THERE. ESPECIALLY DURING A CHARGED POLITICAL SEASON. THIS WAS GUY WAS LIKE A MINOR DUDE. EXACTLY. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE Laura: WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT STARTED. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TIMING. I WOULD BET MONEY WHEN THEY STARTED THIS INVESTIGATION, THEY HAD NO IDEA WHO WAS INVOLVED. THEY DIDN'T THINK AT THE BEGINNING IT WENT TO DONALD TRUMP OR THAT HIGH. THEY WERE FOLLOWING A LEAD OF A SUSPICIOUS AND SPECIFIC STATEMENT THAT GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS GAVE TO SOMEBODY ELSE. THEY WILL CHASE THAT DOWN AS YOU WOULD WANT THEM TO DO I THINK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON. Laura: THAT TRIP TO LONDON IN MAY OF 2016, DOES THAT SEEM IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THAT IS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF MECHANISM THAT WAS TRANSMITED TO THE FBI. THE IDEA IT CAME FROM THE STATE
