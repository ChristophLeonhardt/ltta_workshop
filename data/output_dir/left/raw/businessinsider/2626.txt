1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,040
- Weird orgies.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,430
Wild parties.

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,220
Roots in Hell.

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,430
How did marijuana get such a bad wrap?

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,687
The answer is simple.

6
00:00:09,687 --> 00:00:10,630
(record scratch)

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,463
Racism.

8
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:15,490
(digital music)

9
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,120
As early as the 1800s, there
were no federal restrictions

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,860
on the sale or possession
of cannabis in the US.

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,030
Hemp fiber from the plant was used to make

12
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,230
clothes, paper, and rope.

13
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,330
Sometimes it was used medicinally,

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,830
but as a recreational drug,
it wasn't that widespread.

15
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,110
A New York Times article
from 1876 even cites

16
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:40,080
the positive use of cannabis
to cure a patient's dropsy.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,000
Basically swelling from
an accumulation of fluid.

18
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,900
In the early 1900s an influx of

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,350
Mexican immigrants came to the US

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,180
fleeing political unrest
in their home country.

21
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,560
With them, they brought
the practice of smoking

22
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,550
cannabis recreationally.

23
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,520
And it took off.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,870
The Spanish word for the plant

25
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,020
started to be used more often too.

26
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,200
Marijuana.

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,180
Or as it was spelled at that
time, marihuana, with an H.

28
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,360
This is when the more
sensational headlines

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,910
about the drug began to appear.

30
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,040
In 1936, a propaganda film

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,790
called Reefer Madness was released.

32
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,960
In the movie, teenagers
smoke weed for the first time

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,760
and this leads to a
series of horrific events

34
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,278
involving hallucination,
attempted rape, and murder.

35
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:30,620
(gun shot)

36
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,110
Much of the media portrayed
it as a gateway drug.

37
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,050
- [Reporter] Marijuana,
a powerful excitant,

38
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,630
produces unpredictable emotional results.

39
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,770
But its greatest danger lies in the fact

40
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,150
that it is a stepping
stone to the harder drugs

41
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,860
such as morphine and heroine.

42
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,592
The following year in 1937,

43
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:48,156
the Marihuana Tax Act was passed.

44
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:51,190
Cannabis sales were now taxed.

45
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,900
Part of the reason this act was passed

46
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,002
was because of all the fear
mongering going on at the time.

47
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:59,585
(old timey dramatic music)

48
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:03,189
And a huge instigator
of that fear mongering

49
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,800
was the man behind the Marihuana Tax Act,

50
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,090
Harry Anslinger.

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,990
Anslinger was named the Commissioner

52
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,660
of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics

53
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,320
during the prohibition era.

54
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,339
But once national
prohibition ended in 1933,

55
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:20,720
Anslinger turned his focus to marijuana.

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,350
This is when racism and
xenophobia really kicked in.

57
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,240
Harry Anslinger took the
scientifically unsupported

58
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,780
idea of marijuana as a
violence inducing drug,

59
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,400
connected it to black and Hispanic people,

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,580
and created a perfect package of terror

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,670
to sell to the American media and public.

62
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,090
By emphasizing the Spanish word marihuana

63
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,620
instead of cannabis, he
created a strong association

64
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,020
between the drug and the newly
arrived Mexican immigrants

65
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,640
who helped popularize it in the States.

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,820
He also created a
narrative around the idea

67
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,310
that cannabis made black people

68
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,730
forget their place in society.

69
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,470
He pushed the idea that
jazz was evil music

70
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,650
created by people under
the influence of marijuana.

71
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,080
But these racist ideas
didn't just influence

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,610
the media's portrayal or the

73
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,910
public's perception of the drug,

74
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,390
the discrimination they encouraged

75
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,530
was evident in real numbers.

76
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,940
In the first full year after

77
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,230
the Marihuana Tax Act was passed,

78
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,990
black people were about
three times more likely

79
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,790
to be arrested for violating
narcotic drug laws than whites.

80
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,660
And Mexicans were nearly
nine times more likely `

81
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,695
to be arrested for the same charge.

82
00:03:28,695 --> 00:03:31,290
By 1952, the Boggs Act was passed.

83
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,620
This made sentencing for
drug convictions mandatory.

84
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,130
A first offense for possession

85
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,620
could land you two to five years in prison

86
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,990
and a fine up to $2,000.

87
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,340
Through the 1960s and 70s,

88
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,760
weed smoking took on a new perception

89
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,640
through the counter culture movement.

90
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,593
Young white people
resisted mainstream culture

91
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:53,080
and powerful institutions.

92
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,960
This was the era of hippies,
beatniks, and flower power.

93
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,030
But despite all the peace and love,

94
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,635
laws continued to emphasize
the severity of the drug.

95
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:05,474
The Controlled Substances Act of 1970

96
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:07,410
passed under President Nixon.

97
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,100
- America's public enemy number one.

98
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,910
- Repealed the Marihuana Tax Act

99
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,210
and instead made cannabis
a schedule I drug.

100
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,029
The most serious class.

101
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:18,049
Schedule I drugs are considered to have

102
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,195
a high potential for abuse and addiction.

103
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:23,000
With no medical use.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,010
Other examples of Schedule I drugs

105
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,210
are heroin, LSD, and ecstasy.

106
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,630
Classifying cannabis as a schedule I drug

107
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,457
has been highly debated since then.

108
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:34,770
- Marijuana is not a schedule I

109
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,810
any more than a hedgehog
is an apex predator.

110
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,490
- But to this day, it
remains in that category

111
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,010
and criminalization
still disproportionately

112
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,483
affects minority groups in the US.

113
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:48,396
The ACLU reported that in 2010,

114
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:50,980
black people were four times more likely

115
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,040
to be arrested for
marijuana than white people,

116
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,030
even though both groups consume marijuana

117
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,500
at about the same rate.

118
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,220
Some states have taken action to

119
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,670
reduce this type of criminalization.

120
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,350
Nine states and Washington DC

121
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,670
have legalized the
recreational use of cannabis.

122
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,190
And 29 states allow some
form of medical marijuana.

123
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,760
San Francisco recently dropped

124
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,370
thousands of marijuana
related convictions.

125
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,650
And Seattle plans to do the same.

126
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,540
But this doesn't change
the federal restrictions.

127
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,300
And Attorney General Jeff Sessions

128
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,250
seems Hell bent on enforcing
those federal rules.

129
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,440
- Good people don't smoke marijuana.

130
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,700
- Kansas State
Representative Steven Alford

131
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,980
made a case against legalizing cannabis

132
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,640
by referring to the racist rhetoric

133
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,990
of the Anslinger era.

134
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160
- And we're still seeing a lot of

135
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,220
anti-immigrant sentiment.

136
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,920
- They're bringing drugs,

137
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,440
they're bringing crime,

138
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,500
their rapists.

139
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,760
- So while some things have
changed on the state level,

140
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,100
some politicians are sticking
with the fear mongering

141
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,810
and racism playbook.

142
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,650
Even though Pew Research polls show that

143
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,570
61% of Americans now approve
of nationwide legalization.

144
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,420
Up from 16% about 30 years ago.

145
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,650
Popular opinion suggests it's high time

146
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,531
to reconsider federal laws.

147
00:06:24,531 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
