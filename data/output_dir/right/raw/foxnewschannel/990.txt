1
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:10,570
MAJORITY WHIP STEVE SCALISE SAYS

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,805
EVERYTHING IS DEPENDENT ON KIM

3
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:13,073
JONG-UN FOLLOWING STEPS.

4
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:16,376
NOW WE GO TO TARA MALLER.

5
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:17,544
THANK YOU, FIRST OF ALL.

6
00:00:17,544 --> 00:00:19,112
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

7
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:19,913
>> Shep: THE FIRST THING THAT

8
00:00:19,913 --> 00:00:22,482
HAPPENED IS WE LEARNED FROM THE

9
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:24,584
PARTIES ABOUT THE DISCUSSION IN

10
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:25,318
SINGAPORE THAT THE PRESIDENT

11
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:26,786
TOLD HIM YEAH, THE PROVOCATIVE

12
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:28,355
WAR GAMES ARE OVER.

13
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:30,323
MEANING THE DEFENSIVE DRILL

14
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:31,458
EXERCISES WON'T HAPPEN ANYMORE.

15
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,660
WE LEARNED THAT HE HADN'T TOLD

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,561
THE SOUTH KOREANS.

17
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,863
THEN WE KNEW THAT WOULD GET TO

18
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:37,264
WASHINGTON.

19
00:00:37,264 --> 00:00:39,099
THEN WE KNEW PEOPLE WOULD HAVE

20
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:40,934
TO START EXPLAINING, CONGRESS

21
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:42,202
EXPLAINING, WHAT IT WAS THAT THE

22
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:42,969
PRESIDENT HAD DONE.

23
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:44,804
NOW STEVE SCALISE IS APPARENTLY

24
00:00:44,804 --> 00:00:46,373
DOING A LITTLE CONGRESS

25
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:46,773
EXPLAINING.

26
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:48,408
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW, DO WE,

27
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:50,343
WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?

28
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:52,479
>> WE DON'T KNOW.

29
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,481
>> Shep: NO ONE KNOWS BUT THE

30
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:54,881
PRESIDENT.

31
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:56,583
>> IT'S NOT THAT UNUSUAL IN THE

32
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,585
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

33
00:00:58,585 --> 00:01:00,053
THAT YOU SEE OFFICIALS

34
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:00,854
SCRAMBLING AFTER THE FACT.

35
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:02,656
ONE OF THE TROUBLING THINGS

36
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,324
RELATED TO THE SUMMIT -- I WANT

37
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:05,458
TO PRAISE THE SUMMIT.

38
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,428
THE FACT THAT IT OCCURRED, YOU

39
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:11,831
HAVE DIPLOMACY IN PLAY, THAT'S

40
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:12,198
POSITIVE.

41
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,833
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, I THINK IT

42
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,735
WAS PROBLEMATIC THAT WE DON'T

43
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:17,370
HAVE A TRUE RECORD OF WHAT

44
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,805
TRANSPIRED BETWEEN THE TWO

45
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:19,873
LEADERS, PARTICULARLY --

46
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:21,374
>> Shep: WE DON'T HAVE ANY

47
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:22,342
RECORD OF WHAT HAPPENED.

48
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:23,176
>> NO RECORD OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

49
00:01:23,176 --> 00:01:24,311
THE ROOM, WHAT WAS SAID, WHAT

50
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:27,280
WAS PROMISED AND WHAT WASN'T

51
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,647
PROMISED.

52
00:01:27,647 --> 00:01:30,717
IN THE DISCUSSIONS AFTER,

53
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:32,152
THERE'S NO OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT

54
00:01:32,152 --> 00:01:34,554
OR DISCOVERY.

55
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:38,024
I JUST FIND THAT SOMEWHAT

56
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:38,458
PROBLEMATIC.

57
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,627
NOT JUST FROM THE --

58
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:41,761
>> Shep: SERIOUSLY?

59
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:43,596
YOU'RE STRAIGHTFORWARD USUALLY.

60
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:45,532
>> I THINK I UNDERSTAND THERE

61
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:46,533
ARE REASONS YOU WANT TO KEEP

62
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:49,602
SOME DISCUSSIONS PRIVATE.

63
00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:50,971
BE THERE NEEDS TO BE A REPORT

64
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,439
EVEN IF IT'S A SUMMARY.

65
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,140
PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS THE

66
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,476
LANGUAGE THAT WAS USED IS VERY

67
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:59,012
IMPRECISE IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT

68
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:00,647
BOTH SIDES SIGNED.

69
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:01,381
IT WAS VAGUE.

70
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,283
DIDN'T EVEN REALLY MEET THE BAR

71
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:07,087
OF PREVIOUS NEGOTIATIONS.

72
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:08,788
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LANGUAGE ISN'T

73
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,690
ALL THAT PRECISE ABOUT STOPPING

74
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,092
THE WAR GAMES, HALTING THE WAR

75
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:12,392
GAMES.

76
00:02:12,392 --> 00:02:14,394
THEY'RE SCHEDULED TWICE A YEAR

77
00:02:14,394 --> 00:02:17,163
WITH OTHER EXERCISES IN BETWEEN.

78
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:19,165
I'M NOT SAYING THAT SHOULD BE

79
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:19,833
OFF THE TABLE.

80
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,868
HAVING SAID THAT, THERE SHOULD

81
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:29,509
BE THE NORTH KOREANS NEED TO DO

82
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:29,626
X

83
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:31,011
X, Y AND Z BY THIS TIME FRAME

84
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:32,479
AND THEN WE'LL CHANGE AROUND THE

85
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,380
DRILLS.

86
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,581
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

87
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:39,019
THE PENTAGON WAS CAUGHT OFF

88
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:40,653
GUARD AND JAPANESE AND THE SOUTH

89
00:02:40,653 --> 00:02:40,987
KOREANS.

90
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:42,655
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE

91
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:45,392
SEE THE PRESIDENT WALK IT BACK

92
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:46,593
ONCE EVERYBODY SEES WHAT HAPPENS

93
00:02:46,593 --> 00:02:47,961
AND WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS WILL

94
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,029
DO GOING FORWARD.

95
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:50,397
>> Shep: AS YOU MENTIONED, THE

96
00:02:50,397 --> 00:02:52,065
PROCESS IS DIFFERENT THAN IT

97
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:52,599
USED TO BE.

98
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,902
IN THE WORLD YOU'RE DISCUSSING,

99
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:56,870
PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD LAY OUT

100
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,905
SOME SORT OF VAGUE IDEAS AND

101
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:00,240
MIKE POMPEO COULD GO IN THERE

102
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,376
AND REALLY GET SOME DIPLOMACY

103
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:05,011
GOING AND MAYBE MAKE SOME

104
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:06,479
PROGRESS, WHICH WOULD BE THE

105
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,215
BEST THING IMAGINABLE.

106
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:11,818
SO NOW IT'S UP TO MIKE POMPEO.

107
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:13,319
>> IT IS AND THE HARD WORK OF

108
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,522
INDIVIDUALS BEHIND THE SCENES AT

109
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:16,389
THE STATE DEPARTMENT IN THE

110
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:17,057
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

111
00:03:17,057 --> 00:03:18,792
ALL OF THESE RESOURCES NEED TO

112
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,060
COME INTO PLAY IN TERMS OF

113
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,395
LAYING OUT A STRUCTURED

114
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:24,397
TIMETABLE OF PHASED NEGOTIATION.

115
00:03:24,397 --> 00:03:25,899
WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE HERE IS

116
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:27,600
SOMETHING THAT LAYS OUT IF WE DO

117
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,769
X, THAT I FOLLOW WITH Y AND VICE

118
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:31,871
VERSA OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.

119
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,873
THAT'S HOW YOU BUILD CONFIDENCE

120
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:34,507
AND TRUST.

121
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:36,576
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME WHAT KIM

122
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,712
JONG-UN SAID TO TRUMP IN THIS

123
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:40,046
MEETING.

124
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:41,347
IT MATTERS WHETHER OR NOT HIS

125
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:43,316
ACTIONS ALIGN WITH THAT AND WE

126
00:03:43,316 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN VERIFY THAT.
