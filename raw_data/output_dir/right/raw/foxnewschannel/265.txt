00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:09,770
>> Harris: BREAKING NEWS,

2
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:11,305
KANYE WEST IN THE OVAL OFFICE,

3
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:11,939
WATCH.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,542
>> THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND GIVE

5
00:00:14,543 --> 00:00:14,942
OPPORTUNITY.

6
00:00:14,943 --> 00:00:15,810
A LOT OF TIMES IT'S JUST AN

7
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:18,979
OVERALL LACK OF PREPARATION AT

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,848
ANY GIVEN POINT.

9
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:24,919
WE SAY THIS IS RACIST, THIS IS

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,519
RACIST, THIS IS RACIST.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,557
WE HAD TO OPEN UP THE WHOLE

12
00:00:29,558 --> 00:00:30,324
CONVERSATION.

13
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:31,525
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOODS I LOVE

14
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:34,729
THAT LIBERALS TRY TO DO,

15
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,864
LIBERALS WILL TRY TO CONTROL A

16
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:37,298
BLACK

17
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:38,933
PERSON BECAUSE THEY KNOW

18
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:42,069
WE ARE VERY PROUD, EMOTIONAL

19
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,104
PEOPLE.

20
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:45,706
TO SOMEONE THAT'S LIBERAL, THEY

21
00:00:45,707 --> 00:00:48,309
WILL SAY "HE'S RACIST."

22
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,844
YOU THINK RACISM CAN CONTROL ME?

23
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:55,549
THAT'S AN INVISIBLE WALL.

24
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,986
YOU HAVE ONE QUESTION TO ANOTHER

25
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:01,322
QUESTION, I DON'T ANSWER

26
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:03,224
QUESTIONS FOR SOUND BITES, YOU

27
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:10,331
ARE TASTING A FINE WINE.

28
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:12,366
IT'S LIKE "MINORITY REPORT," IT

29
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,368
AIN'T THAT SIMPLE, IT'S COMP

30
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:14,668
LAST.

31
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:17,538
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD

32
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:18,272
LIKE TO ASK PRESIDENT TRUMP TO

33
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:22,009
DO FOR CHICAGO.

34
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,313
>> THE THING THAT THE HEAD OF

35
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:29,016
THE POLICE MET WITH ME LAST

36
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:33,154
NIGHT, IT DOES NOT HELP THE

37
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:33,954
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE CITY AND

38
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:37,425
EVERYONE THAT KNEW I WAS COMING

39
00:01:37,426 --> 00:01:39,660
HERE ASKED ABOUT STOP AND FRISK.

40
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:42,296
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING WE

41
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:45,733
ARE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION

42
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:46,534
ABOUT.

43
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:49,136
ANOTHER THING IS OPENING IT UP

44
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:51,038
IN THE STREETS, WE'VE GOT TO GET

45
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:54,542
SOME TAX BREAKS.

46
00:01:54,543 --> 00:01:58,679
THE SHOES ARE COSTING US $300,

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,782
WE NEED SOME PROTOTYPES HERE SO

48
00:02:01,783 --> 00:02:04,151
WE CAN GET PEOPLE BACK WORKING

49
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:06,887
SO CHINA CAN'T JUST BEAT US, THE

50
00:02:06,888 --> 00:02:08,289
GREATEST JEANS COMPANY IN THE

51
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,158
WORLD MAKING THEIR GENES IN

52
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:11,492
VIETNAM.

53
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:13,360
WERE GOING TO NEED TO GET A FEW

54
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:14,562
BREAKS TO HAVE SOME PLACES IN MY

55
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:20,167
HOMETOWN OF CHICAGO,

56
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:20,868
2.7 MILLION, 9 MILLION AROUND

57
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:22,136
THE SUBURBS TO CREATE SOME

58
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:22,937
FACTORIES.

59
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:25,539
I THINK IT WOULD BE COOL IF THEY

60
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,141
WERE TRUMP FACTORIES, BECAUSE

61
00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:28,142
HE'S A MASTER OF INDUSTRY, HE'S

62
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:30,478
A BUILDER.

63
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,914
A MIX OF EDUCATION THAT EMPOWERS

64
00:02:33,915 --> 00:02:37,718
PEOPLE AND GIVES THEM MODERN

65
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,352
INFORMATION.

66
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:40,087
SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS KID HAS

67
00:02:40,088 --> 00:02:45,459
A.D.D., THIS KID HAS A.D.D.

68
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,494
HE DOESN'T HAVE A.D.D., SCHOOL

69
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:48,963
IS BORING.

70
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:52,132
WE NEED TO MAKE IT MORE EXCITIN

71
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:52,566
EXCITING.

72
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:53,534
JUST LIKE BASKETBALL WHILE

73
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:55,569
YOU'RE DOING MATH, YOU LEARN

74
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,537
ABOUT MUSIC WHILE YOU MEDITATE

75
00:02:56,538 --> 00:03:01,408
IN THE MORNING.

76
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,379
MENTAL HEALTH AND ART PROGRAMS,

77
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,182
THOSE ARE -- AND ALSO, LARRY

78
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:08,516
HOOVER.

79
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:11,585
AN EXAMPLE OF A MAN TURNING HIS

80
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:15,256
LIFE AROUND, THEY HIT HIM WITH

81
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:15,923
SIX LIFE SENTENCES.

82
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:18,792
YOU SAY DON'T TEAR DOWN THE

83
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:21,529
STATUE, LARRY HOOPER IS A LIVING

84
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,367
STATUE, HE'S A BEACON FOR US.

85
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:27,635
YOU HAVE A BLOCK LEADER ON EVERY

86
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:30,971
SINGLE BLOCK, THEY WOULD ON THE

87
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:31,272
BLOCK.

88
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:33,240
IT'S SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM

89
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:35,743
JIM BROWN, WE NEED TO PUT

90
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:36,410
CURRICULUMS FOR PEOPLE WHO

91
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:38,178
REALLY CAME FROM THE STREETS,

92
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:39,213
NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST TRYING

93
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:42,283
TO SET US UP TO GO INTO A PRISON

94
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:43,250
SYSTEM THAT APPLIES TO WHAT

95
00:03:43,251 --> 00:03:44,919
PEOPLE ARE REALLY ONTO WHICH JIM

96
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:51,358
JIM BROWN HAS CREATED.

97
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:52,860
THE PROBLEM IS THE LEGAL GUNS,

98
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:55,129
THE LEGAL GUNS OF THE PROBLEM.

99
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:03,137
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

100
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:05,139
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID HE

101
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,807
FAVORS STOP AND FRISK, WILL YOU

102
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:08,142
BE DISCUSSING THAT?

103
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:09,977
>> I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT YOU ON

104
00:04:09,978 --> 00:04:10,678
THE SPOT.

105
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:14,949
WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT.

106
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,284
>> HE CAN SPEAK FOR ME ANYTIME

107
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:20,354
HE WANTS, GREAT GUY.

108
00:04:20,355 --> 00:04:20,788
SMART COOKIE.

109
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:22,957
HE GETS IT.

110
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,224
JIM BROWN, HE'S BEEN DOING THIS

111
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:29,330
FOR A LONG TIME.

112
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:35,803
COULD VERY WELL BE.

113
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:38,172
>> THE THING IS, LET'S STOP

114
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:39,173
WORRYING ABOUT THE FUTURE.

115
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:41,375
ALL WE REALLY HAVE IS TODAY.

116
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:43,978
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

117
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,747
THAT HEROES JOURNEY.

118
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:55,956
TRUMP IS ON HIS HEROES JOURNEY.

119
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:58,993
BUT BEST BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO

120
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:01,028
MAKE AMERICA GREAT.

121
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:04,298
ANOTHER THING IS BLACK PEOPLE

122
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:05,366
HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE WORD

123
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:08,669
AGAIN AND MY FEELINGS ON THAT,

124
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,972
I'M GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY.

125
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:13,674
ALL WE HAVE IS NOW, ALL WE HAVE

126
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:19,413
IS TODAY.

127
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:22,182
IT HURTS US BECAUSE WE NEED TO

128
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:26,654
FOCUS ON WHO WE ARE NOW.

129
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,791
I BROUGHT SOME HATS IN, A BIT OF

130
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:31,225
A TRANSITION.

131
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:35,062
I MADE A HAT THAT SAYS "MAKE

132
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:35,529
AMERICA GREAT."

133
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:41,468
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE AT THE

134
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:42,136
SUPER BOWL TRUMP WEARING THE

135
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:46,407
MAKE AMERICA GREAT HAT, COMMON

136
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:47,708
WEARING THE MAKE AMERICA GREAT

137
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:49,343
AND SHOWING WE CAN BEND A BIT ON

138
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:50,044
THIS SIDE, BEND A BIT ON THIS

139
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:56,784
SIDE AND LEARN HOW TO BE

140
00:05:56,785 --> 00:06:00,654
MALLEABLE, THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO

141
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:04,091
STICK -- WE ARE ONE UNIT, WE ARE

142
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:04,558
ONE COUNTRY.

143
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,160
WE ARE ONE MOMENT IN HISTORY AND

144
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:08,629
IN TIME.

145
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,365
THE GREATEST VALUE PEOPLE HAVE

146
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:17,271
OTHER PEOPLE AND WE CAN STOP.

147
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:18,739
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS QUESTION,

148
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,375
YOU'RE IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

149
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:23,177
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE IN THE

150
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:23,677
OVAL OFFICE.

151
00:06:23,678 --> 00:06:25,813
>> IT IS GOOD ENERGY.

152
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:27,948
>> JIM, HOW DO YOU FEEL?

153
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:32,186
>> I FEEL GOOD.

154
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:34,955
YOU ARE SO RESPECTED, WHAT KANYE

155
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:36,957
HAS BEEN DOING HAS BEEN

156
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,292
INCREDIBLE, ALL OVER THE WORLD

157
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:39,993
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS, I

158
00:06:39,994 --> 00:06:40,661
HAD IMPORTANT MEETINGS TODAY

159
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:44,098
WITH SENATORS, NOBODY CARED,

160
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:44,832
THEY WANTED THIS MEETING.

161
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:49,069
IS THAT RIGHT?

162
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,207
THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT.

163
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,374
IT'S MY HONOR, JIM.

164
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,510
I'VE BEEN A FAN OF YEARS FOR A

165
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,012
LONG TIME, A LONG TIME.

166
00:06:59,013 --> 00:06:59,747
NOBODY LIKE YOU.

167
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:02,983
NO ATHLETE LIKE YOU.

168
00:07:02,984 --> 00:07:10,758
>> I'M HERE TO SERVE.

169
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,826
>> THAT'S ALL THE     ALWAYS BEH

170
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:13,060
>> THAT'S ALL THE     ALWAYS BEE

171
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:17,965
WAY JIM HAS BEEN, A LONG TIME.

172
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:18,766
IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL.

173
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,901
JENNIFER, DID YOU HAVE A

174
00:07:20,902 --> 00:07:23,370
QUESTION?

175
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:24,371
I AM OPEN TO EVERYTHING.

176
00:07:24,372 --> 00:07:26,607
I THINK IT'S A SHAME WHAT'S

177
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:27,608
HAPPENING IN CHICAGO.

178
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:30,778
I'M IN CHICAGO A LOT, TOO.

179
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,613
I HAVE NICE THINGS IN CHICAGO,

180
00:07:32,614 --> 00:07:33,580
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

181
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:37,518
I HATE TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

182
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,919
THEY'RE HAVING NUMBERS, NUMBERS

183
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,991
OF PEOPLE BEING SHOT AND KILLED,

184
00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:45,592
IT'S NOT FOR THIS COUNTRY.

185
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:46,393
SO THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AND

186
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:50,030
I AM TOTALLY OPEN, WE CAN DO IT

187
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:52,399
A DIFFERENT WAY, I'M TOTALLY

188
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,000
OPEN.

189
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:54,168
WE ALL AGREE THEY HAVE TO DO

190
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:58,172
SOMETHING, THAT'S FOR SURE.

191
00:07:58,173 --> 00:07:59,773
MAYBE IT'S A COMBINATION OF

192
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:02,009
BOTH, I GUESS IT IS BUT I THINK

193
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,443
IT'S PROBABLY A COMBINATION OF

194
00:08:03,444 --> 00:08:05,312
BOTH AND ALSO IT'S A RESPECT

195
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:05,612
ISSUE.

196
00:08:05,613 --> 00:08:08,982
THEY RESPECT THIS GUY, THEY

197
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:11,084
RESPECT TO THIS GUY, IT'S A BIG

198
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:13,420
THING.

199
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:14,988
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE NOT

200
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:16,356
RESPECTING, LET'S SAY YOUR MAYOR

201
00:08:16,357 --> 00:08:18,025
OR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN CHICAGO,

202
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:19,793
CERTAINLY IT SHOULDN'T BE

203
00:08:19,794 --> 00:08:20,794
HAPPENING, WHAT'S GOING ON THERE

204
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:25,632
SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING.

205
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:27,000
HONESTLY, FROM OUR STANDPOINT,

206
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:27,968
THIS WAS JUST SET UP TO BE A

207
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,071
LUNCH OF TWO PEOPLE THAT I LIKE

208
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:32,172
AND I GUESS THEY LIKE ME AND WE

209
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:35,843
ARE GOING TO HAVE LUNCH AND TAL

210
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:36,143
TALK.

211
00:08:36,144 --> 00:08:38,178
>> YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.

212
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,313
>> I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU IN

213
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,781
THAT SPOT.

214
00:08:41,783 --> 00:08:44,318
>> I'M STANDING IN THAT SPOT, I

215
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:46,787
LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

216
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:50,991
I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

217
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:52,392
>> THAT'S REALLY NICE.

218
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:55,562
I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT YOU IN THAT

219
00:08:55,563 --> 00:08:55,929
POSITION.

220
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,630
BUT THAT'S FROM THE HEART,

221
00:08:56,631 --> 00:08:59,800
SPECIAL GUY.

222
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:00,500
THESE TWO ARE SPECIAL PEOPLE,

223
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:01,301
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR YOU DON'T

224
00:09:01,302 --> 00:00:00,000
LIKE IT, THEY ARE SPECIAL PEOPLE
