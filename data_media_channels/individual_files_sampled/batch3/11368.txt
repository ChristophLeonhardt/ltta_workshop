a group of US Republican congressman here in Moscow now what they describe as a mission to improve relations to see how sanctions have hit Russia in the last hour they wrapped up a meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov we can tell you it's good like we did a cognitive issue is there forests Medina how did that meeting go what do we know well the largest delegation of US Congressmen has flown to Moscow the largest delegation and quite a while to have an official meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and of course this all set the stage ahead of the official first one-on-one summit between the US and Russia presidents which is scheduled for July the 16th now right after this meeting was over we managed to ask the head of the delegation the u.s. senator from Alabama Richard shall be a few questions on how the meeting went I had a good meeting we discussed a lot of serious issues and mainly focused on the settlers we need we will be competitors but we don't need to be adversaries and maybe we will have a new day but we will have to wait and see do you think that the talks and Helsinki could be productive considering the domestic pressure on the US president not to be kind of friendly with Russia do you think it could be productive well I think that we have to look at Russia as a as a as a superpower and very competitor and not an adversary and we'll see what happens they'll have to go to their meeting and they will and I think they're both looking for a better day while the sanitary Schwartz do stands and quite a contrast with his a policy on Russia that he weighs voiced previously now on his website there is a statement which says that his office will continue to protect their homeland from Russian aggression while at the moment it does seem that both parties are calling for a productive dialogue and as for the US delegation well they do have quite a busy day ahead of them they do have a number of scheduled meetings were the different Russian politicians yeah I could do some talking going on dear the cops never thanks the update they're from central Moscow you
