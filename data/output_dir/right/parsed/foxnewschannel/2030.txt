FLYNN.
HE SHOWED NO SIGNS THAT HE WAS
LYING.
HERE NOW FOX NEWS SENIOR
TRADITIONAL ANALYST JUDGE
NAPOLITANO.
I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD TO THIS
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" PIECE.
IF THERE'S SOME VERY SENSITIVE
LANGUAGE AT PLAY IN ALL OF THIS.
WHAT HAS BEEN MADE CLEAR IS THAT
THE AGENT WHO INTERVIEWED
MICHAEL FLYNN, SAID HE SHOWED NO
SIGNS OF DECEPTION.
THAT'S BEING TAKEN TO UNDERSTOOD
AS THEY BELIEVE HE DIDN'T LIE.
>> AGENTS WELL TRAINED AND
LOOKING FOR SIGNS OF DECEPTION.
TURNED OUT HE DID LIE.
WE KNOW THAT.
IT PAINS ME TO SAY THIS.
LOT OF AFFECTION AND RESPECT FOR
THE CAREER OF GENERAL FLYNN.
I'M NOT SO SURE THAT I WOULD
HAVE INDICTED HIM IF I WAS
MUELLER.
WE KNOW HE LIED, THERE'S A
RECORDING OF THE CONVERSATION
AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN AN ELICIT
RECORDING.
IT'S A RECORDING.
WE KNOW IT OCCURRED.
WE KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT.
>> UNMASKED CONVERSATION?
>> CORRECT.
UNMASKED BY OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
IT WAS PUTTED IN "WASHINGTON
POST" IT WAS INTENDED TO
EMBARRASS THEN PRESIDENT-ELECT
TRUMP.
THE QUESTION IS WHY DID THEY
INDICT HIM FOR SUCH A MINOR
INSIGNIFICANT LIE?
I'M NOT DOWN PLAYING --
>> UNDERLYING CONVERSATION,
THERE'S A VERY GOOD ARGUMENT
THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH HIM
HAVING THAT CONVERSATION.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> THE PROBLEM WAS HE DISCUSSED
THE POTENTIAL FUTURE ACCORDING
TO THIS, OF WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION WILL BE OPEN TO
LIFTING SANCTIONS.
WHICH IS NORMAL CONVERSATION TO
HAVE.
>> UNDERLYING CONVERSATION WAS
NOT ONLY LAUREL -- LAWFUL AND
WHOLESOME.
I WANTED TO GET A HOOK IN
GENERAL FLYNN JUST LIKE A HOOK
IN PAPADOPOULOS AND SWEDISH
LAWYER.
THEY THINK THEY CAN GET
INFORMATION FROM THESE FOLKS.
IN RETURN FOR NOT GOING AFTER
GENERAL FLYNN FOR EVERYTHING
UNDER THE SUN, FAILING TO
REGISTER, THEY CUT A DEAL, YOU
HELP US OUT, PLEAD GUILTY TO
LYING.
MAX SIX MONTHS.
DID HE HELP THEM OUT WITH
ANYTHING.
WE DON'T KNOW.
DEPENDS ON WHO'S INDICTED.
>> THE OTHER THING THAT I FOUND
REALLY INTERESTING IN THIS
EDITORIAL TODAY.
IS THIS SECTION FROM ANDREW
McCABE.
TALKING ABOUT THE CASE.
WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT HERE IS THAT
THIS IS FROM THE HOUSE INTEL
REPORT.
INITIALLY THEY REDACT ALL OF
THIS STUFF.
THEN THEY RELEASED A NEW VERSION
AND YOU WOULD ASSUME, THEY
REDACTED THINGS THAT ARE
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
IT TURNS OUT WHAT THEY HAD
BLACKED OUT WAS STUFF THAT MADE
McCABE LOOK BAD.
>>   THIS IS WHAT DEVIN NUNES
HAS BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT LOUD
AND LONG.
THESE REDACTIONS ARE PROPORTEDLY
FOR NATIONAL SECURITY PURPOSES.
>> THAT'S WHAT -- WE PUT IT UP.
DEPUTY DIRECT McCABE
CONDITIONALLED THAT THE TWO
PEOPLE WHO INTERVIEWED FLYNN
DIDN'T THINK HE WAS LYING WHICH
WAS NOT A GREAT BEGINNING OF A
FALSE STATEMENT CASE.
WHY WOULD THAT BE REDACTED?
>> THE POWER TO REDACTS A
CORRUPT POWER.
IT SHOULDN'T BE IN THE HANDS OF
THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED THE
DOCUMENT.
IT SHOULD BE IN THE HANDS OF
SOME NEUTRAL ENTITY TO DECIDE
WHAT IS SO SENSITIVE THAT
CONGRESS CAN'T SEE IT.
WHAT WOULD CAUSE THE DEATH OF A
SOURCE.
WHAT WOULD CAUSE WITNESS TO FLEE
A DEFENDANT TO GET OUT OF THE
WAY
>> THAT MAKES THEM LOOK BAD.
>> MEANTIME, GENERAL FLYNN IS
STILL STUCK WITH THIS.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING
TO GO.
HE PLEADED GUILTY UNDER OATH.
HE CAN'T TAKE THAT BACK WITHOUT
ANOTHER CHARGE OF PERJURY.
>> WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE HANGING
