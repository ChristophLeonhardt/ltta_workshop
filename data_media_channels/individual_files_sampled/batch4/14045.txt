I'm as relevant with the rebel media it is now 3:15 in the afternoon here in London England we are at the Royal Courts of Justice a majestic building the courtroom itself was ornate the three judges presiding included the Lord Chief Justice of the United Kingdom himself Ian Burnett it was a very sober methodical proper hearing I have to say the way the appeal was conducted gave me encouragement Tommy Robinson had four lawyers in the room in the United Kingdom the profession is split between barristers and solicitors he had two of each and I think that's excellent because this is such an important case I kid I guess you could call it a bit of a dream team the barrister Jeremy Dean was very methodical the solicitor John Carson tough as nails I'm hoping I'm hoping they did an effective job on the other side was not a prosecutor or anyone that was necessarily antagonistic but rather a delegate from the attorney general's office his name was Louis Mabley and he was there called a friend of the court in America that would be called an amicus curiae to provides views on the law to help coach the court I think in some respects he was antagonistic to Tommy but he wasn't viscerally so I I didn't think he went too far I think if I had to read the tea leaves I'd say the Lord Chief Justice himself seems sympathetic to Tommy he really honed in on the strengths of Tommy's appeal and he pointed out some of the weaknesses and the counter arguments by mr. may blame so I found that very encouraging there were two secondary or associate justices they were less voluble than the Chief Justice and may be less supportive but if I had to tell you my guess it would be that Tommy Robinson will be released now at the end of today's hearing we're done by the way I thought it might proceed into tomorrow but we're done the judges said Chief Justice himself said that the three judges want to confirm and given how important this case is not just for Tommy and his supporters and not just for the incidents at hand but the precedent that that will this will set I mean this will create many precedents how journalists can treat trials how contempt of court is handled procedurally the kind of punishments that can mean mete it out to a contender that's a word I learned today that's someone in contempt so there's so much law that will be created in any given trial the precedent that said is not necessarily strong but when you have the Lord Chief Justice himself with two associate judges weighing in on a case as political as this it will cast a shadow for decades to come a precedent so it is wise and thoughtful for the Chief Justice to say give us some time to write this properly of course it is but what troubled me someone is that the justice said we might need the end of July well that's a long time for Tommy Robinson to have to continue to rot in solitary confinement I might have thought that the judges would have granted him bail while they take their sweet time in writing the appeal that did not happen now that said the judges could return any time they could come back tomorrow I don't think they will but when they say they want the rest of July that doesn't mean they need to take the rest of July I think that Tommy will get out of prison his lawyers asked for everything they asked for they criticized the length of the sentence but they also criticized his convictions not just the one in Leeds in May but the one in Canterbury last year if you recall that's a quite a dramatic reach but when you throw everything at the wall something might stick and I think Tommy just needs one of those things to stick and he's out if he appeals the sentence and the judges say yeah that's too long he's out if he gets the Leeds conviction quashed he's out because he's already served so much time if he gets the canterbury matter quashed well then surely the Leeds matter will be quite - I think Tommy may win one or two out of these three things and be set free it was an education for me as a Canadian to see how the British system works earlier today we spoke to will Chamberlain an American attorney he was flabbergasted not only by the procedure but by the lack of First Amendment freedom of speech and I have to agree with him the idea that a political journalist would be in prison for 13 months for reporting outside a rape gang trauma is shocking and it should shock Brits I don't know if it has I think too many Brits have passively accepted the Orwellian present in which they live but I would say today was an excellent day as you can see behind me there still lingering crowds of free Tommy activists many of them have been here since 8:00 9:00 in the morning that's when I first saw them they're still commiserating with each other sharing stories I suppose taking strength from the fact that there are other Tommy's supporters out there if you were to look at the mainstream media you would think the whole world despises Tommy Robinson I think that's not true just the opinion elites despise them I've been making a point of taking the black traditional taxi cabs and gently raising the issue of Tommy Robinson with cab drivers and once they know I'm not sort of hunting them for a politically correct gotcha moment they open up and in fact I have yet to meet a taxicab driver who is not a fan of Tommy and I say that I know that's anecdotal and maybe I've just encountered the four cabbies in town who like him but no I think it's a sign between the class divide the lovey's the toffs as they say the fancy pants as we might say the snobs versus the chavs folks who say oh eh bruv you know I've learned so many fun idioms from Tommy and my accents terrible but I think that there are several Britain's and the kind of folks who are represented behind me they love Tommy now that said there's a diversity of people here people of every race and religion and background you see an RAF vet with a chest full of medals very impressive I saw some traditionally dressed Orthodox Jews I saw a gentleman here from Iran I saw a Muslim fella a progressive Muslim we see working-class people we'd see people who've driven in from afar we see professionals who have jammed this in their day I should say that towards the end of the day several UK politicians presented including Gerard Battin the leader of the party himself as well as a fellow member of the European Parliament whose card I don't have on me and I'm she's great there we go Janis Atkinson she's been a real troublemaker lately so my kind of gal so yeah it's it's very interesting I'm so glad I'm out here let me close with a thank you to you our rebel viewers you really helped make this possible Tommy Robinson was not appealing he was not gonna peel this case but you provided the dough you crowdfunded the dough at save Tommy calm and as you know 100% of any surplus there will go to Tommy's family and you even crowdfunded my plane ticket and hotel affair to come here from Canada and I'm really glad I did you helped out at Tommy trial calm so thank you for chipping in twice so and by the way I met a lot of people here today who had chipped in also from the UK so this is a real grassroots rebellion even the journalism we're doing here well I've gone on quite too long but I'm just giving you the thoughts of the day I would say I'm optimistic cautiously optimistic I think the legal team did a good job I think it was nice to see a broad variety of support for Tommy Tommy himself looks sharp he looked alert he looked upbeat when he recognized someone on the video phone that he knew you could see his heart warm and he smiled and waved it was actually quite touching there were some family members of Tommy here today obviously they keep a very low profile for obvious reasons but I think they were touched as well and they expressed through me to you our viewers their gratitude for your help some I helped I mean I chipped in a little bit I suppose but a miniscule amount compared to what what our viewers have done so really this is your success and when Tommy is freed that will be your success as well on behalf of all of us at the rebel dot media both in Toronto here in London and around the world thanks for fighting for freedom and please keep in touch I'm here in London at Tommy's Court of Appeal hearing for all of my updates go to Tommy Trial calm you
