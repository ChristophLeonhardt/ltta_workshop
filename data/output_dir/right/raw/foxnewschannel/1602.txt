1
00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:05,911
SIGNS MIGHT BE YET TO COME.

2
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:06,312
MELISSA?

3
00:00:06,312 --> 00:00:07,012
>> Melissa: TRACE GALLAGHER,

00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:07,446
THANK YOU.

5
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:09,215
MY NEXT GUEST,

00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:10,282
UNFORTUNATELY, KNOW ALL TOO

7
00:00:10,282 --> 00:00:11,050
WELL WHAT THE VICTIMS OF

8
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:11,917
THESE FAMILIES ARE GOING

9
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:13,085
THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

10
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:14,553
ANDREW POLLACK'S DAUGHTER

11
00:00:14,553 --> 00:00:15,921
MEADOW WAS KILLED IN THE

12
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:17,123
PARKLAND, FLORIDA MASS

13
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:18,691
SHOOTING AT STONEMAN DOUGLAS

14
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:20,126
HIGH SCHOOL ON FEBRUARY 14TH

15
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:22,561
AND HE JOINS ME NOW.

16
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:23,496
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE

17
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:26,132
TIME TO BE WITH US TONIGHT.

18
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:26,565
WHAT WAS.

19
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:28,868
>> THANKS, MELISSA.

20
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:29,502
>> Melissa: WHAT WAS GOING

21
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:30,269
THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU

22
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:30,803
SAW THIS TODAY?

23
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:33,038
>> WELL, MY HEART SANK TO MY

24
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:34,406
STOMACH WHEN I FOUND OUT,

25
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:36,575
WHEN I STARTED THE -- THE

26
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:37,510
TEXT MESSAGES STARTED TO

27
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,910
COME IN.

28
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,811
YOU KNOW WHAT?

29
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,779
AS THE DAY GO WENT ON I'M

30
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:43,149
GETTING ANGRIER AND ANGRIER

31
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:44,083
HOW THIS HAPPENED AGAIN.

32
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,050
HOW MANY KIDS IN THIS

33
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,418
COUNTRY ARE WE GOING TO LET

34
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:47,820
GET MURDERED IN A SCHOOL.

35
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,088
LIKE WHEN IS SNUFF?

36
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:50,356
WHEN IS ENOUGH KIDS GOING TO

37
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:52,024
GET SHOT IN A SCHOOL WHERE

38
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:54,226
WE ACTUALLY -- WE ACTUALLY

39
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:55,461
SET UP A PERIMETER WITH

40
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:57,863
ENTRY POINTS AND METTLED

41
00:00:57,863 --> 00:00:58,497
DETECTORS?

42
00:00:58,497 --> 00:00:58,998
>> Melissa: YEAH.

43
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:01,066
IT'S RIDICULOUS ALREADY.

44
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:03,135
>> Melissa: I KNOW YOU ARE

45
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:04,670
AND ADVOCATE FOR SCHOOL

46
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,004
SAFETY.

47
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:05,738
IS THE PERIMETER AT THE TOP

48
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:06,872
OF YOUR LIST OF THINGS THAT

49
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:09,108
YOU THINK WE NEED?

50
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:10,309
>> WELL, LISTEN.

51
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:12,278
THIS IS OUR SOCIETY WHAT IS

52
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:12,878
DEALT TO US.

53
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:14,480
SO WE NEED TO HAVE SINGLE

54
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,015
POINT ENTRIES AND THERE

55
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:17,716
NEEDS TO BE METAL DETECTORS.

56
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:20,252
LOOK, YOU CAN'T GET ON A

57
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:21,687
PLANE WITH YOUR SHOES ON.

58
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:23,055
YOU HAVE GOT TO TAKE YOUR

59
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:24,290
SHOES OFF TO GET OFF A

60
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:24,590
PLANE.

61
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,491
YOU CAN'T GET IN A

62
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:25,891
COURTHOUSE.

63
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:27,359
YOU CAN'T GO INTO A FOOTBALL

64
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:27,693
STADIUM.

65
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:29,328
SO WHY IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO

66
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:30,663
KEEP LETTING OUR KIDS GET

67
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:32,264
SHOT IN A SCHOOL?

68
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:33,365
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

69
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:35,334
WE NEED METAL DETECTORS AT

70
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:37,069
OUR SCHOOLS AND THAT WILL

71
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:37,970
SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

72
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,139
OUR KIDS SHOULDN'T GO TO

73
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:41,373
SCHOOL AND FEEL THAT THEY'RE

74
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:43,242
NOT SAFE AND OUR TEACHERS,

75
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:43,509
TOO.

76
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,110
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE GOT TO FIX

77
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,377
IT.

78
00:01:45,377 --> 00:01:46,879
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO

79
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,281
DO THAT WE COULD DO THIS

80
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:49,648
WEEK.

81
00:01:49,648 --> 00:01:50,149
>> Melissa: YEAH.

82
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:51,483
A LOT OF PARENTS AT HOME

83
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:52,518
WATCHING THIS FEEL LIKE IT'S

84
00:01:52,518 --> 00:01:53,452
A SITUATION THAT'S OUT OF

85
00:01:53,452 --> 00:01:55,187
CONTROL AND THEY ARE

86
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:56,422
FRUSTRATED THE SAME WAY YOU

87
00:01:56,422 --> 00:01:57,389
ARE ABOUT NOTHING GETTING

88
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:57,690
DONE.

89
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,625
HELP THEM TAKE SOME ACTION.

90
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,893
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO IF THEY

91
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:02,861
GO TO THEIR KID'S SCHOOL ON

92
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:03,529
MONDAY, WHAT QUESTIONS

93
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:04,463
SHOULD THEY ASK?

94
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:05,631
WHAT SHOULD THEY LOOK FOR TO

95
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:07,233
TRY TO KEEP THEIR KIDS SAFE?

96
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:08,767
IT'S A FIRST STEP TO GO TO

97
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:09,335
THAT SCHOOL.

98
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:11,270
WHAT SHOULD THEY LOOK FOR?

99
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,672
>> THEY SHOULD GO THERE AND

100
00:02:13,672 --> 00:02:15,541
SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO GET IN

101
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,443
THE SCHOOL IN THE MORNING.

102
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:18,911
CAN ANYBODY WALK IN?

103
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:20,346
HOW MANY ENTRY POINTS ARE

104
00:02:20,346 --> 00:02:20,913
THERE?

105
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:21,947
DO THEY HAVE A SCHOOL

106
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:23,349
RESOURCE OFFICER?

107
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,417
THIS SCHOOL IN TEXAS, THEY

108
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:26,151
ACTUALLY THERE COULD HAVE

109
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:28,287
BEEN A LOT MORE FATALITIES.

110
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:30,489
I THINK HE HAD HAD TWO SRO

111
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:32,024
OFFICERS AT THAT SCHOOL.

112
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:33,025
SO YOU HAVE GOT TO LOOK AT

113
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:34,059
THE SCHOOL.

114
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:35,227
GO BACK AN HOUR LATER.

115
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:37,162
MAKE SURE THE GATES ARE

116
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:37,630
LOCKED.

117
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,764
SEE, YOU KNOW, GET INVOLVED

118
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:42,167
WITH YOUR SCHOOL BOARDS.

119
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:42,668
>> Melissa: YEAH.

120
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:44,203
>> ALSO PEOPLE ASK ME, I

121
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:45,638
JUST WANT TO MAKE A POINT,

122
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:47,072
WHAT COULD YOU SAY TO THESE

123
00:02:47,072 --> 00:02:49,375
FAMILIES THAT LOST THEIR

124
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:49,808
CHILDREN?

125
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:50,342
>> Melissa: UM-HUH.

126
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:51,777
>> THERE IS NOTHING THAT

127
00:02:51,777 --> 00:02:52,978
ANYONE COULD SAY TO A PARENT

128
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:54,380
THAT LOST A KID IN A SCHOOL

129
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,080
SHOOTING THAT'S GOING TO

130
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,148
MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER.

131
00:02:56,148 --> 00:02:57,383
YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT THE

132
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:59,051
WORLD TO KNOW THAT, THAT WE

133
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:01,553
HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUS AND

134
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:02,488
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WITH

135
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:04,056
LETTING OUR KIDS GET SHOT.

136
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:05,124
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NEVER

137
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:06,425
GOING TO BE THE SAME, THESE

138
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:06,759
PEOPLE.

139
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,694
AND IT ANGERS ME THAT THESE

140
00:03:08,694 --> 00:03:09,662
PARENTS NOW ARE GOING TO

141
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:11,997
FEEL LIKE I DO AND, BELIEVE

142
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:13,532
ME, IT'S NOT FUN.

143
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:15,401
I HAVEN'T FELT ANY BETTER

144
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:17,636
SINCE FEBRUARY 14TH.

145
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:18,337
IT'S 90 DAYS LATER.

146
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:20,105
AND I FEEL THE SAME PAIN AS

147
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:21,073
THE 14TH.

148
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:23,809
SO THERE'S NOTHING NOW --

149
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:25,044
NOW THESE PARENTS LICE ARE

150
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:26,478
CHANGED FOREVER.

151
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:27,179
>> Melissa: I KNOW THAT YOU

152
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:28,414
ARE SUING A NUMBER OF

153
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:29,214
PEOPLE.

154
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:30,015
INCLUDING NIKOLAS CRUZ'S

155
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:31,550
PARENTS FOR WRONGFUL DEATH

156
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,686
OR MOTHER, PARDON ME FOR

157
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:34,386
WRONGFUL DEATH.

158
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:35,921
IN THIS CASE WE ARE HEARING

159
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,089
AS WE ARE HEARING IN EARLY

160
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:38,257
REPORTS, THE GUN BELONGED TO

161
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:39,625
THE SHOOTER'S PARENTS MAY

162
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,460
NOT HAVE BEEN LOCKED UP.

163
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,961
WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THESE

164
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:43,295
DETAILS.

165
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:44,330
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

166
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,364
THAT AND DO YOU THINK THAT

167
00:03:45,364 --> 00:03:47,066
IN SOME CASES SOME OF THE

168
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:49,635
PARENTS NEED TO BE HELD

169
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:50,035
RESPONSIBLE?

170
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:51,570
>> I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD

171
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,039
REALLY LOOK INTO IT AND

172
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,708
BEING A RESPONSIBLE GUN

173
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,042
OWNER, YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR

174
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:58,143
GUNS LOCKED UP.

175
00:03:58,143 --> 00:04:00,112
YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM WHERE A

176
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:02,114
MINOR HAS ACCESSIBILITY TO

177
00:04:02,114 --> 00:04:04,283
BE ABLE TO GO GET YOUR GUN.

178
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:05,984
SO, I'M ALL FOR THAT I THINK

179
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:07,586
THE PARENTS SHOULD BE HELD

180
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:07,986
RESPONSIBLE.

181
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,288
YOU WILL SEE SOME THINGS

182
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:10,656
CHANGE IF YOU START HOLDING

183
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:14,159
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE.

184
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,227
AND THEY SHOULD LOOK INTO

185
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:16,495
THAT I REALLY THINK THEY

186
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:17,796
SHOULD HAVE HAD THOSE GUNS

187
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:20,466
LOCKED UP.

188
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:21,433
BEYOND THAT WALKED INTO A

189
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,668
SCHOOL WITH A SHOTGUN.

190
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:23,669
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T WALK

191
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:25,504
INTO THE COURTHOUSE SO WHY

192
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:26,839
IS IT ACCEPTABLE THAT THIS

193
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,540
KID TOOK A SHOTGUN AND

194
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,776
WALKED IN TO A SCHOOL AND

195
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:32,511
SHOT THESE KIDS?

196
00:04:32,511 --> 00:04:33,212
IT'S ENOUGH.

197
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:35,581
YOU KNOW, I KEEP GETTING

198
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:36,582
ANGRIER AS I THINK ABOUT

199
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:36,882
THIS.

200
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:38,217
AND I LOOK AT THE PICTURES

201
00:04:38,217 --> 00:04:39,785
WHILE I'M WAITING TO GET

202
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:40,886
INTERVIEWED, I'M LOOKING AT

203
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:41,920
PICTURES OF MY DAUGHTER AND

204
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,389
I'M SAYING NOW THERE IS 10

205
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:44,456
MORE FAMILIES THAT HAVE TO

206
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:48,560
LIVE LIKE I DO.

207
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,261
>> Melissa: DO YOU HAVE ANY

208
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:50,596
WORD FOR THEM TO GET THROUGH

209
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:50,863
YOU?

210
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:51,530
SAY THERE IS NOTHING THAT

211
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,865
YOU CAN SAY TO MAKE THEM

212
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:53,799
FEEL BETTER BECAUSE THEY

213
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:54,700
WON'T FEEL BETTER.

214
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,268
BUT PERHAPS IT'S ABOUT

215
00:04:56,268 --> 00:04:56,835
JOINING THE FIGHT?

216
00:04:56,835 --> 00:04:57,703
>> YES.

217
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:58,771
I WELCOME THEM TO REACH OUT

218
00:04:58,771 --> 00:04:59,805
TO ME.

219
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:01,240
I WOULD LOVE FOR THEM TO

220
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,740
CALL ME.

221
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,175
I WILL BE THERE FOR THEM.

222
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:04,877
THAT'S ALL I COULD DO FOR A

223
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:06,044
PARENT THAT LOST A KID IS

224
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:07,413
JUST BE THERE FOR THEM WHEN

225
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:08,147
THEY NEED YOU.

226
00:05:08,147 --> 00:05:09,081
THERE IS NOTHING YOU COULD

227
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:10,182
SAY THAT'S GOING TO TAKE

228
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:11,517
AWAY THE PAIN.

229
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:13,051
BUT LET'S MAKE SURE IT

230
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:14,052
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN, YOU

231
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:14,353
KNOW.

232
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:16,054
I'M GOING TO GO -- I THINK

233
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:17,156
I'M GOING TO GO TO TEXAS.

234
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:18,090
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE

235
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,425
NOW AND I WANT TO GO SEE

236
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:20,359
SOME OF THESE FAMILIES AND

237
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,794
JUST GIVE THEM A HUG AND LET

238
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:23,295
THEM KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, I

239
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:25,164
KNOW HOW THEY FEEL BECAUSE

240
00:05:25,164 --> 00:05:26,465
NO ONE ELSE KNOWS HOW YOU

241
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:28,667
FEEL UNTIL YOU LOSE A KID.

242
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:29,968
AND IT'S A HORRIBLE,

243
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:32,604
HORRIBLE FEELING, MELISSA.

244
00:05:32,604 --> 00:05:33,338
>> Melissa: YEAH, I HAVE NO

245
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:33,639
DOUBT.

246
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,606
OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU.

247
00:05:34,606 --> 00:00:00,000
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON
