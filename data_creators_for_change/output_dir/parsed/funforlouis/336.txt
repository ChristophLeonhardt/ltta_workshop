okay what what even is this
it's getting crazy now I feel like I'm
escaping jail right now we are following
a map but it's still pretty difficult
down here because it's all looks very
very similar so I think we're a little
bit lost right now keep in mind that
this up here is the road like there's
you're driving over top of us right now
this could be somebody's house people
are sleeping above us this is there's
like real life is going on up there and
all this exists under Paris whoa you
claustrophobic you do not want to try
and get through here okay I've heard to
take my backpack off because this is so
narrow
so many rooms oh my gosh it just keeps
going
well that is freaky guys and look how
freaky this is why is it a dolphin so
crazy what is going on on earth this is
the biggest open area of the catacombs
it's been turned into like tons of
different rooms I'm already a bit lost
and there's weird things like these
mannequins like hanging from the ceiling
and stuff this is freaky right
is this really freaky in there I'm just
talking to huge rooms of just just more
rooms and more rulers mad mad places
here yeah let's go
alright guys this one seems quite a bit
older than the other signs we've seen is
it the first 17 or nothing we've seen
seen quite a few 18 months hello this is
like 18 1875 and this one's is 1784 oh
you can go down right over here is where
the bones are the actual bones
all right here is this graveyard this is
where the tombs are
so if some of you may feel like we've
got a morbid fascination with the tombs
but it's more just that it's kind of
incredible to me that they chose to bury
people under here we're going down yeah
it's like sloping down isn't it it's the
first sign of a vein
all right just in the middle of the path
just walking seeing human remains well
you're just scattered on the floor well
they just kind of just scattered on the
floor with the mud this is like people
this is like this is a natural person
that was just like alive and had a life
and it's like walking around and stuff I
mean look what I'm in go through yeah
there's bones everywhere here man I hear
something you hear something no I rather
you come here sir mess what like a rat
literally climbing over bones themself
they visit us we have a brain right yes
this is kind of creepy boy wow this is
like this looks this looks like a hip
bone bro I found part of a skull their
skulls over there this is just like the
top of the skull maybe oh my goodness
oh my goodness there are so many bones
and I can't walk the path without
stepping on someone or multiple people
in just one walk it's unbelievable
this is the craziest experience of my
life I feel like the skull is quite
delicate so this is all probably part of
the same skull John I mean yeah
is this the first cutter can you beam it
this is the first true and probably the
only real catacomb I'll ever go on with
you no no tourists around me no guide
like a real-deal thing this is how you
feeling about the bones Berg it's an
experience I can't forget like I'm not
weirded out or anything by this because
other cultures they see these bones and
like oh that's normal to them like South
America and northern stuff so it's
interesting
this just doesn't compute in my my head
Louie this is just ice creeper of bones
what a skyscraper of human remains
it's just bones stacked on bones like
you would only see this in a movie how
did you even get up there I just crawled
in like a weird okay
what what even is this what guys as far
as I can see up there it's just bones
looking this is like a whole shaft full
of bones this is just insane
it's like climbing into a grave from
hundreds of years ago
he's mind-blowing I you're gonna you're
gonna freak out and get in there I'm
kind of just like yeah really weirded
out looking at all these skull fragments
the thing that fascinates me the most
like someone's mind was in here this is
the most intact of skull that we've seen
this is crazy this is like half a skull
and guys check this this is that just
part the jaw this is part of a jawbone
you can actually see where the teeth
went in here as well yes it's amazing so
unfortunately we have to leave now we've
been under here for over three hours and
we are we're gonna be late if you don't
get out soon forget back to the UK so
