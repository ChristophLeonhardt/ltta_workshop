I'M SANDRA SMITH AND JON SCOTT 
IS JOINING ME IN NEW YORK.
NIKKI HALEY OFFERING HER 
RESIGNATION AND HE SPOKE AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE MOMENTS AGO.
BOTH OF THEM TOOK AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.
IT COMES AS A SHOCK TO 
WASHINGTON INSIDERS, NO ONE 
KNEW LEADING UP TO THIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT.
SHE LET HER STAFF KNOW AS OF 
THIS MORNING.
THE PRESIDENT AND NIKKI HALEY 
MEETING INSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE.
BOTH SHARED THEIR THOUGHTS ON 
THIS BREAKING NEWS.
LET'S LISTEN.
>> President Trump: NORTH 
CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, 
TEXAS, PUERTO RICO, SO MANY 
PLACES.
WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE COMING, A 
BIG ONE.
MUCH BIGGER THAN THEY 
ANTICIPATED SEVEN DAYS AGO.
I HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THERE WAS A VERY SMALL DROP OF 
WEATHER THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS 
FORMING AND NOW IT'S PRETTY 
CLOSE TO A CATEGORY 3 IF IT IS 
NOT ALREADY A CATEGORY 3.
WE ARE VERY WELL PREPARED.
FEMA IS READY.
WE'RE ALL READY.
SPOKE WITH GOVERNOR SCOTT, 
SPOKE TO EVERYBODY THAT YOU 
HAVE TO SPEAK TO.
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET LUCKY.
MAYBE THAT WON'T HAPPEN.
BUT WE'RE PREPARED.
I WANTED TO DO THIS BECAUSE 
NIKKI HALEY, AMBASSADOR TO THE 
UNITED NATIONS, HAS BEEN VERY 
SPECIAL TO ME.
SHE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB.
SHE IS A FANTASTIC PERSON, VERY 
IMPORTANTLY, BUT SHE ALSO IS 
SOMEBODY THAT GETS IT.
SHE HAS BEEN AT THE UNITED 
NATIONS FROM THE BEGINNING AND 
WORKED WITH US ON THE CAMPAIGN.
IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME, VERY 
INTENSE AND SHE TOLD ME 
PROBABLY SIX MONTHS AGO SHE 
SAID MAYBE AT THE END OF A 
TWO-YEAR PERIOD, BUT TEND OF 
THE YEAR I WANT TO TAKE A 
LITTLE TIME OFF.
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK.
SHE HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL 
GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA, FOR 
EIGHT YEARS.
THEN SHE DID THIS AND THIS IS 
POSSIBLY EVEN MORE INTENSE WITH 
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD.
VERY DANGEROUS AND A LOT OF 
THINGS.
SHE HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB 
AND WE'VE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB 
TOGETHER.
WE'VE SOLVED A LOT OF PROBLEMS 
AND IN THE PROCESS OF SOLVING A 
LOT OF PROBLEMS.
AT THE BEGINNING NORTH KOREA 
WAS A MASSIVE PROBLEM.
NOW WE'RE MOVING ALONG REALLY 
NICELY.
I CAN SPEAK FOR SECRETARY OF 
STATE MIKE POMPEO, HE THINKS 
THE WORLD OF NICKI.
AND SO WE'RE ALL HAPPY FOR YOU 
IN ONE WAY BUT WE HATE TO LOSE 
YOU.
HOPEFULLY YOU WILL BE COMING 
BACK AT SOME POINT.
MAYBE A DIFFERENT CAPACITY.
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PICK.
BUT I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW 
AT THE END OF THE YEAR NIKKI 
WILL BE LEAVING AND WE'LL BE IN 
CONSTANT TOUCH.
YOU KNOW ALL THE PLAYERS.
THAT WAS THE THING I THINK SHE 
DID BEST AT THE UNITED NATIONS.
SHE GOT TO KNOW THE PLAYERS.
SHE GOT TO KNOW CHINA, RUSSIA, 
INDIA.
SHE KNOWS EVERYBODY ON A VERY 
FIRST NAME BASIS AND THEY LIKE 
HER EXCEPT FOR MAYBE A COUPLE 
WHICH IS NORMAL.
THEY REALLY LIKE HER.
I THINK MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY 
THEY RESPECT HER.
SO NIKKI, I WANT TO TELL YOU 
WE'LL MISS YOU.
WE'LL SPEAK OVER TIME AND WE'LL 
MISS YOU AND YOU HAVE DONE A 
FANTASTIC JOB AND I WANT TO 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I WANT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL I 
WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT FOR 
JUST ALLOWING US TO COME OUT 
AND TALK TO YOU THIS WAY.
IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR OF A 
LIFETIME.
I SAID I'M SUCH A LUCKY GIRL TO 
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEAD THE 
STATE THAT RAISED ME AND TO 
SERVE A COUNTRY I LOVE SO VERY 
MUCH HAS REALLY BEEN A BLESSING 
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
THAT.
BUT I'M MOST EXCITED.
LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN 
TWO YEARS WITH THE UNITED 
STATES ON NORTHERN POLICY.
COUNTRIES MAY NOT LIKE WHAT WE 
DO BUT THEY RESPECT WHAT WE DO.
IF WE SAY WE'LL DO SOMETHING WE 
FOLLOW IT THROUGH.
THE PRESIDENT PROVED THAT 
WHETHER IT WAS WITH THE 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA OR 
NATO OR THE TRADE DEALS.
THEY GET THE PRESIDENT MEANS 
BUSINESS AND THEY FOLLOW 
THROUGH WITH THAT.
BUT THEN IF YOU LOOK AT TWO 
YEARS AT THE U.N.
WE'VE GOT $1.3 BILLION IN THE 
U.N.'S BUDGET.
MADE IT STRONGER AND MORE 
EFFICIENT.
SOUTH SUDAN WE GOT AN ARMS 
EMBARGO.
THREE NORTH KOREAN PACKAGES 
DONE IN A WAY TO WORK TOWARD 
DENUCLEARIZING NORTH KOREA.
BRINGING IRAN AND SAYING YOU 
CAN'T OVERLOOK THE BAD THINGS 
THEY'RE DOING AND SEE THEM FOR 
THE THREAT THEY ARE.
THE ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS AND THE 
COURAGE THE PRESIDENT SHOWED IN 
MOVING THE EMBASSY AND SHOWING 
THE REST OF THE WORLD WE WILL 
PUT OUR EMBASSY WHERE WE WANT 
TO PUT OUR EMBASSY.
ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE MADE A 
HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE U.S. 
STANDING BUT I CAN TELL YOU 
THAT THE U.S. IS STRONG AGAIN.
THE U.S. IS  STRONG IN A WAY IT 
SHOULD MAKE ALL AMERICANS PROUD.
NOT JUST THE PRESIDENT I WANT 
TO THANK.
THE FAMILY IN GENERAL.
THE FIRST LADY HAS BEEN NOTHING 
BUT VERY KIND TO ME.
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS 
ABOUT JARED AND IVANKA.
JARED IS SUCH A HIDDEN GENIUS 
THAT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS.
TO REDO THE NAFTA DEAL THE WAY 
HE DID.
WHAT I'VE DONE WORKING WITH HIM 
ON THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PLAN 
IS SO UNBELIEVABLY WELL DONE.
IVANKA HAS BEEN A GREAT FRIEND 
AND THEY DO A LOT OF THINGS 
BEHIND THE SCENES THAT I WISH 
MORE PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT BECAUSE 
WE'RE A BETTER COUNTRY BECAUSE 
THEY'RE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION.
I ALSO JUST HAVE TO SAY 
CERTAINLY THANK YOU TO MY 
FAMILY, MICHAEL IS A SAINT AND 
MY TWO LITTLE ONES, I ADORE 
THEM AND TO TEAM US/UN.
THEY PUT A LOT OF TIME AND 
ENERGY INTO IT BUT THEY HAVE A 
LOT OF HEART AND REALLY WANTED 
TO MAKE AMERICA PROUD AND SO 
WITH THAT I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL 
THE END OF THE YEAR.
MY GOAL IS THAT WE MAKE SURE 
THAT EVERYTHING IS IN GOOD 
PLACE AND FOR THE NEXT 
AMBASSADOR TO COME IN BUT IT IS 
A GREAT DAY IN THE UNITED 
STATES AND I'M PROUD TO HAVE 
BEEN PART OF THE TEAM.
NOW I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SET 
ON WHERE I'M GOING TO GO.
I THINK THAT THE MAIN THING WAS 
I WAS GOVERNOR FOR SIX YEARS 
AND WE DEALT WITH A HURRICANE, 
A THOUSAND YEAR FOOD, A CHURCH 
SHOOTING, SCHOOL SHOOTING.
THEN TO COME IN FOR TWO YEARS 
AT THE U.N.
I'M A BELIEVER IN TERM LIMITS.
I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE SELFLESS 
ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN YOU STEP 
ASIDE AND ALLOW SOMEONE ELSE TO 
DO THE JOB.
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR OF A 
LIFETIME AND I WILL SAY THIS 
FOR ALL OF YOU THAT ARE GOING 
TO ASK ABOUT 2020, NO, I'M NOT 
RUNNING FOR 2020.
I CAN PROMISE YOU IS THAT I'LL 
BE CAMPAIGNING FOR THIS ONE.
I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING 
THE PRESIDENT IN THE NEXT 
ELECTION.
>> President Trump: THANK YOU.
>> WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO LEAVE 
IT BEHIND?
IS IT REALLY A PERSONAL 
DECISION BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN 
AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY?
>> MY FAMILY IS VERY SUPPORTIVE.
THERE IS NO PERSONAL REASONS.
I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
FOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO 
UNDERSTAND WHEN IT IS TIME TO 
STEP ASIDE.
AND I HAVE GIVEN EVERYTHING 
I'VE GOT THESE LAST EIGHT YEARS 
AND I DO THINK THAT SOMETIMES 
IT'S GOOD TO ROTATE IN OTHER 
PEOPLE WHO CAN PUT THAT SAME 
ENERGY AND POWER INTO IT.
SO THERE REALLY IS A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WILL WANT TO SAY THERE 
ARE A LOT OF REASONS WHY I'M 
LEAVING.
THE TRUTH IS I WANT TO MAKE 
SURE THIS ADMINISTRATION AND 
THE PRESIDENT HAS THE STRONGEST 
PERSON TO FIGHT.
IT WAS A BLESSING TO GO INTO 
THE U.N. WITH BODY ARMOR EVERY 
DAY AND DEFEND AMERICA.
I'LL ALWAYS DO THAT.
I WILL NEVER TRULY STEP ASIDE 
FROM FIGHTING FOR OUR COUNTRY 
BUT I WILL TELL YOU I THINK 
IT'S TIME.
>> WHY MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT 
NOW AS OPPOSED TO AFTER THE 
MID-TERMS?
>> President Trump: NICKI WILL 
BE STAYING UNTIL THE END OF THE 
YEAR, JUST ABOUT TWO YEARS.
AND I JUST THINK -- I WAS JUST 
-- AS NIKKI WAS SPEAKING WHEN 
WE CAME INTO OFFICE IT WAS 
ALMOST INEVITABLE IN THE MINDS 
OF MANY WE WERE GOING TO WAR 
WITH NORTH KOREA.
IF YOU ASKED PRESIDENT OBAMA 
THAT WAS HIS BIGGEST PROBLEM 
WHEN WE SAT AND MET RIGHT HERE.
BUT THAT LOOKED LIKE A REAL 
PROBLEM.
IRAN LOOKED LIKE A REAL PROBLEM.
IT WAS A QUESTION OF WHEN WOULD 
THEY TAKE OVER THE MIDDLE EAST 
PRIOR TO MY COMING HERE.
NOW IRAN IS FIGHTING FOR THEIR 
LIVES.
THEY HAVE RIOTS IN ALL THEIR 
CITIES, IT IS BLOWING UP.
INFLATION AND ECONOMY IS IN 
TATTERS.
AT SOME POINT THEY'LL PROBABLY 
COME AND WANT TO MAKE A REAL 
DEAL.
NOT THE RIDICULOUS DEAL THAT 
THEY MADE THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE 
TO ME AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
WHAT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IRAN 
WHEN WE FIRST CAME.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THE DAY 
BEFORE WE CAME, AND ALSO IF YOU 
LOOK AT NORTH KOREA.
THERE WAS A DEAL THAT THERE WAS 
SOMETHING THAT WAS DEVASTATING 
-- POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING 
PROBLEM.
NOW THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE VERY 
GOOD.
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 
JUST LEFT, HAD A GREAT MEETING 
ALSO WITH CHINA, ALSO SPOKE TO 
MANY OF THE ASIAN LEADERS OR 
WENT THERE AND HAD SOME GOOD 
MEETINGS BUT HAD A REALLY VERY 
GOOD MEETING WITH NORTH KOREA.
AND CHAIRMAN KIM.
WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS 
ON SO MANY OTHER FRONTS ALSO.
AS NIKKI SAID, THE WORLD IS 
RESPECTING THE UNITED STATES 
AGAIN.
WE'RE RESPECTED AGAIN, THAT I 
CAN TELL YOU, VERY MUCH 
RESPECTED AGAIN.
AND PEOPLE WANT TO BE ON OUR 
SIDE.
EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE VOTES 
IN THE UNITED NATIONS.
VOTES THAT WE WOULD GET NO 
VOTES WE'RE GETTING STRONG 
VOTES NOW.
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK NIKKI.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN 
APPROPRIATE WAY TO DO IT.
WHEN YOU WRITE IT ON A PIECE OF 
PAPER THAT AMBASSADOR HALEY 
WILL BE LEAVING AND YOU SAY 
NICE THINGS PEOPLE SAY WHAT IS 
GOING ON?
THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.
WHEN YOU REALLY THINK SOMEBODY 
HAS DONE A TERRIFIC JOB.
I FELT THIS WAS AN APPROPRIATE 
WAY OF DOING IT AND WE BOTH 
LIKED IT SO I JUST WANT TO 
THANK THE AMBASSADOR.
I JUST WANT TO THANK NIKKI.
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT 
WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO DO IT.
IT IS A GREAT POSITION AND 
NIKKI REALIZES THAT.
I THINK SHE HAS HELPED MAKE IT 
A MUCH BETTER POSITION IF YOU 
WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
I THINK IT HAS BECOME MAYBE A 
MORE GLAMOROUS POSITION THAN IT 
WAS TWO YEARS AGO.
MAYBE, I WONDER WHY, BUT IT IS.
SHE HAS MADE IT A VERY 
GLAMOROUS POSITION AND MADE IT 
A MORE IMPORTANT POSITION.
SO WE HAVE -- I CAN ALMOST SAY 
MANY PEOPLE THAT WANT TO DO IT 
AND THEY'RE VERY GOOD PEOPLE.
I'LL BE TALKING ALSO TO NIKKI 
ABOUT THAT AND TO THE GENERAL 
ABOUT THAT AND MY STAFF.
WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE 
VERY, VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN 
DOING IT.
>> President Trump: NOT ONLY AM 
I NOT FRUSTRATED.
I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT'S 
HAPPENING.
YOU TALKING ABOUT NORTH KOREA.
WHO ARE YOU WITH?
IT'S AMAZING THE WAY THE MEDIA 
SAYS FOR 80 YEARS THEY COULDN'T 
DO A THING AND WHAT ARE WE IN, 
THREE MONTHS OF NEGOTIATION?
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
AS I'VE SAID ABOUT A THOUSAND 
TIMES.
NO ROCKETS OR MISSILES FLYING 
OR NO NUCLEAR TESTING.
YOU HAVE NUCLEAR CLOSINGS.
THEY'RE CLOSING DIFFERENT AREAS 
OF NORTH KOREA, WE'RE GETTING 
THE REMAINS BACK.
IT'S ALREADY STARTED OF OUR 
GREAT HEROES.
WE GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK AND I 
DIDN'T PAY $1.8 BILLION LIKE 
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.
I PAID NOTHING.
BUT I HAVE AGREED TO MEET AND I 
HAVE AGREED TO SPEND TIME.
BUT HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE 
WE LEFT SINGAPORE?
THREE MONTHS OR SO AND PEOPLE 
SAY THAT'S THE MEDIA SAYING HOW 
CAN WE BE NEGATIVE?
HOW CAN WE BE NEGATIVE?
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED?
I THINK -- NO NUCLEAR TESTS, NO 
ROCKETS, AND WE HAVE A VERY 
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAIRMAN 
KIM WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT.
I LIKE HIM, HE LIKES ME, THE 
RELATIONSHIP IS GOOD.
MIKE POMPEO HAD A VERY GOOD 
MEETING.
I SPOKE TO HIM AT LENGTH 
YESTERDAY AND HE WILL BE COMING 
BACK.
HE WILL BE BACK TONIGHT.
AND SO JUST THE OPPOSITE.
I THINK WE'VE MADE INCREDIBLE 
PROGRESS.
BEYOND INCREDIBLE.
I DON'T THINK -- SOME OF THE 
PRESS REALLY COVERS IT 
ACCURATELY AND RIGHT.
BUT SOME OF THE PRESS REALLY 
DOESN'T.
>> DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS 
OPPORTUNRTUNITY WHEN YOUR NEXT 
MEETING WITH KIM WILL BE?
>> President Trump: IT IS 
HAPPENING NOW.
THEY ARE SETTING UP THE MEETING 
AND WE'LL BE ANNOUNCING THAT 
PROBABLY AT A DIFFERENT 
LOCATION.
SINGAPORE WAS FANTASTIC BUT 
WE'LL PROBABLY DO A DIFFERENT 
LOCATION.
>> MAR-A-LAGO?
>> HE WOULD PROBABLY LIKE THAT.
WE'LL SEE.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE OR 
FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.
TIMING WON'T BE TOO FAR AWAY.
WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS AND 
THIS MEETING -- PEOPLE DON'T 
REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 
FIRST MEETING.
WE SAID POINT NUMBER ONE 
DENUCLEARIZATION.
FOR SOME REASON THE PRESS 
DOESN'T PICK THAT UP.
THAT WAS POINT NUMBER ONE.
THEY'VE AGREED TO 
DENUCLEARIZATION AND THEY 
CONTINUE TO AGREE AND THEY 
CONTINUE.
NOW, WE HAVEN'T REMOVED 
SANCTIONS AS YOU KNOW.
PEOPLE SAID WHAT HAVE WE DONE?
WE HAVEN'T REMOVED SANCTIONS.
WE HAVE BIG SANCTIONS.
I WOULD LOVE TO REMOVE THEM BUT 
WE HAVE TO GET SOMETHING FOR 
DOING THAT.
>> President Trump: I DON'T 
WANT TO EMBARRASS ANYBODY BY 
ASKING.
I THINK EVENTUALLY WE'LL HAVE 
LOTS OF MEETINGS ON U.S. SOIL 
AND ON THEIR SOIL, BY THE WAY.
THAT'S A TWO-WAY STREET.
ON THEIR SOIL ALSO.
I THINK THAT THE COUNTRY OF 
NORTH KOREA IS GOING TO BE A 
VERY SUCCESSFUL COUNTRY.
I THINK IT WILL BE INCREDIBLY 
ECONOMICALLY SUCCESSFUL AND I 
WANT TO MAKE IT THAT WAY.
I THINK IT WILL BE GOOD.
OTHER COUNTRIES, OTHER PEOPLE, 
ENTREPRENEUR, BANKS, I WILL 
TELL YOU THEY ARE CALLING AND 
WANTING TO GO THERE AND WANTING 
TO INVEST AT SOME POINT WHEN 
CHAIRMAN KIM MAKES THAT 
DECISION.
I THINK HE WILL UNLEASH 
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 
SPECTACULAR, REALLY SPECTACULAR.
I THINK HE KNOWS IT AND I THINK 
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE 
HAVING VERY SUCCESSFUL 
CONVERSATIONS.
I THINK HE WANTS TO GET ON WITH 
IT.
>> President Trump: I WOULD SAY 
WE'LL NAME A SUCCESSOR -- I 
DON'T KNOW, WITHIN THE NEXT TWO 
OR THREE WEEKS.
MAYBE SOONER.
>> President Trump: I HAVE NOT, 
NO, I HAVEN'T.
BUT I WILL BE AT SOME POINT.
I KNOW NOTHING RIGHT NOW.
I KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE 
KNOWS, NOTHING.
>> 
>> President Trump: THAT'S WHY 
SHE LOST.
SHE DOESN'T GET IT.
SHE NEVER DID.
I KNEW THAT A LONG TIME AGO.
HILLARY NEVER GOT IT.
THAT'S WHY SHE LOST.
ANYTHING ELSE?
>> MID-TERMS ARE IN FOUR WEEKS.
WHAT IS YOUR --
>> President Trump: I THINK 
WE'LL DO WELL.
IF YOU SAW THERE WAS A 5% 
DROP-OFF YOU WOULD SAY THERE IS 
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE 
PRESIDENT YOU WOULD SAY.
I'M GOING TO IOWA TONIGHT.
WE HAVE A BIG CROWD.
GOING TO MAKE A BIG 
ANNOUNCEMENT TONIGHT IN IOWA.
WE'LL BE MAKING A VERY BIG 
ANNOUNCEMENT.
AND I HAVE TO SAY THE FARMERS 
ARE SO THRILLED WITH THE USMCA, 
THE NEW AGREEMENT.
I DON'T USE THE WORD NAFTA 
BECAUSE IT WAS A DISASTER FOR 
OUR COUNTRY.
WE LOST MILLIONS OF JOBS, 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF 
FACTORIES AND PLANTS AND BAD 
FOR FARMERS.
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.
FARMERS OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS 
HAVE ONLY GONE DOWN.
NOW THEY'LL GO UP.
WE JUST OPENED UP MEXICO, WE 
JUST OPENED UP CANADA, AND IT 
IS GREAT FOR OUR FARMERS.
BUT I AM GOING TO IOWA TONIGHT 
AND WE'LL BE TALKING A LITTLE 
ETHANOL TONIGHT.
AND HAVE SOME GREAT THINGS 
GOING.
SPEAKING OF THAT, I WILL SAY, 
IF YOU LOOK AT INDUSTRIES, THE 
STEEL INDUSTRY IN THIS COUNTRY 
IS BACK LIKE NOTHING I'VE EVER 
SEEN BEFORE.
IN A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS SINCE 
WE STARTED DOING WHAT I'M 
DOING, THE STEEL INDUSTRY HAS 
LITERALLY REVIVED.
U.S. STEEL IS OPENING UP EIGHT 
PLANTS.
NUCORE IS OPENING.
THE STEEL INDUSTRY IS HOT.
THAT'S GREAT.
I'LL BE GOING TO IOWA TONIGHT.
>> President Trump: VERY WELL.
WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA.
THEY TOOK OUT $500 BILLION OUT 
OF OUR COUNTRY FOR MANY YEARS 
EACH YEAR.
WE JUST CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TALKED 
ABOUT BY PEOPLE IN THIS CHAIR 
FOR MANY YEARS.
LOOK, FOR YEARS AND YEARS THEY 
WERE TAKING OUT 200, 300, 400, 
AND 500 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.
WE HELPED REBUILD CHINA.
IF WE DON'T DO THAT, CHINA IS 
NOT WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW 
AND THAT'S FINE WITH ME BUT WE 
AREN'T DOING IT ANY LONGER.
>> President Trump: ABSOLUTELY.
100%.
IF THEY DO THAT -- IF THEY 
RETALIATE.
THEY'VE ALREADY RETALIATED 
TAKEN OUT $500 BILLION.
I THINK THAT'S THE ULTIMATE 
RETALIATION.
NO, CHINA WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL 
AND I SAY THEY'RE NOT READY YET.
I SAY THEY'RE NOT READY YET.
WE'VE CANCELED A COUPLE OF 
MEETINGS BECAUSE I SAY THEY'RE 
NOT READY TO MAKE A DEAL.
WE CAN'T HAVE A ONE-WAY STREET.
IT HAS TO BE A TWO-WAY ST. IT 
HAS BEEN A ONE-WAY STREET FOR 
21 YEARS.
WE HAVE TO BENEFIT ALSO.
OKAY?
THANK YOU.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?
SO I JUST WANT TO FINISH 
BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY THE PURE 
REASON FOR THIS IS NIKKI.
YOU'VE BEEN FANTASTIC, YOU ARE 
MY FRIENDS.
ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTRY I WANT 
TO THANK YOU FOR A GREAT JOB.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.
>> Sandra: YOU'VE BEEN 
LISTENING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI 
HALEY, OFFERING HER ABRUPT 
RESIGNATION FROM HER DIPLOMATIC 
POST.
NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW INSIDE OF 
WASHINGTON
I'M SANDRA SMITH IN NEW YORK.
JON SCOTT JOINS US NOW.
THE PRESIDENT ACCEPTED HER 
RESIGNATION SAYING SHE CAME TO 
HIM ABOUT X
