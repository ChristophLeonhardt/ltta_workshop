1
00:00:00,711 --> 00:00:03,980
MORNING ON "FOX NEWS SUNDAY."

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:06,616
NOW TO MY OPENING STATEMENT.

3
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:09,819
YOU KNOW, AMERICANS ELECTED THE

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,921
OUTSIDER BUSINESSMAN PRESIDENT.

5
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:12,255
WHY?

6
00:00:12,256 --> 00:00:14,157
TO BORROW A PHRASE FROM THE MAN

7
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:14,624
HIMSELF.

8
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,192
WHAT DO WE HAVE TO LOSE?

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,267
FACTORIES WERE CLOSING DOWN,

10
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:26,236
JOBS AND MANUFACTURING WERE

11
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:28,605
BEING SHIPPED OVERSEAS, AND IN

12
00:00:28,606 --> 00:00:31,574
TRADE, CHINA WAS SUCKING US DRY.

13
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:34,310
THE OBAMA FOLKS CALLED IT A

14
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:36,613
HEALTHY ECONOMY BUT THERE WAS

15
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:38,915
BARELY A PULSE.

16
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:43,786
1% ANNUAL GDP GROWTH WAS THE NEW

17
00:00:43,787 --> 00:00:45,555
NORMAL AND PRESIDENT OBAMA

18
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:47,323
WARNED DONALD TRUMP'S ELECTION

19
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:48,525
WOULD RESULT IN ECONOMIC

20
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:50,927
DISASTER FOR ALL AMERICANS.

21
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:52,829
>> SOME OF THOSE JOBS OF THE

22
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,131
PAST ARE JUST NOT GOING TO COME

23
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:56,132
BACK.

24
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:59,903
AND WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS LIKE THE

25
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,205
PERSON YOU JUST MENTIONED WHO

26
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:04,407
I'M NOT GOING TO ADVERTISE FOR

27
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:05,942
THAT HE'S GOING TO BRING ALL

28
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:06,976
THESE JOBS BACK.

29
00:01:06,977 --> 00:01:08,778
HOW EXACTLY ARE YOU GOING TO DO

30
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:12,849
THERE IS NO ANSWER TO IT.

31
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,952
HE JUST SAYS I AM GOING TO

32
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:17,253
NEGOTIATE A BETTER DEAL.

33
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:23,626
WHAT MAGIC WAND DO YOU HAVE?

34
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:25,929
AND USUALLY THE ANSWER IS HE

35
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,564
DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER.

36
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:30,433
>> I WANT TO YOU TELL YOUR

37
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:37,307
FRIENDS, DON'T LET A FRIEND VOTE

38
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:38,308
TRUMP.

39
00:01:38,309 --> 00:01:40,410
SO HERE IS THE DEAL.

40
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:42,745
HE CAN'T ESCAPE THE MATH.

41
00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:44,814
MATH CAN BE KIND OF

42
00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:50,587
AND ECONOMISTS LEFT, RIGHT, IN

43
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:52,689
THE MIDDLE, ALL SAY THE SAME

44
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,323
THING.

45
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,558
THAT TRUMP'S POLICIES WOULD

46
00:02:04,902 --> 00:02:06,936
THAT WE HAVE HAD SINCE THE GREAT

47
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:07,370
RECESSION.

48
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:09,606
>> IN THE EVENT DONALD WINS I

49
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:11,507
HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THE

50
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:12,709
MARKETS TANK.

51
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,211
HIS TAX PLAN IN COMBINATION WITH

52
00:02:15,212 --> 00:02:17,380
HIS REFUSAL TO REFORM

53
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:19,248
ENTITLEMENTS AND HONESTLY

54
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:21,417
ADDRESS SPENDING WOULD BALLOON

55
00:02:21,418 --> 00:02:23,252
THE DEFICIT AND THE NATIONAL

56
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:24,120
DEBT.

57
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:27,290
SO EVEN THOUGH DONALD TRUMP IS

58
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,392
OFFERED VERY FEW SPECIFIC

59
00:02:29,393 --> 00:02:30,994
ECONOMIC PLANS, WHAT LITTLE HE

60
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:32,729
HAS SAID IS ENOUGH TO KNOW HE

61
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,764
WOULD BE VERY BAD FOR AMERICAN

62
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:38,434
WORKERS AND AMERICAN FAMILIES.

63
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:42,105
JUDGE JEANINE: THEN WAS PAUL

64
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:48,878
KRUGMAN, A NOBEL PRIZE WING

65
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,312
ECONOMIST.

66
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:51,714
HE SAID THE STOCK MARKET WILL

67
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:53,483
PLUMMET AND NEVER RECOVER FROM

68
00:02:53,484 --> 00:02:55,385
THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP.

69
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:57,487
SO WE ARE VERY PROBABLY LOOKING

70
00:02:57,488 --> 00:03:01,257
AT A GLOBAL RESPECIAL NO END IN

71
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:06,162
HATRED OF DONALD TRUMP, THEY

72
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:07,497
FORGET DECADES OF TRAINING IN

73
00:03:07,498 --> 00:03:08,831
THEIR OWN FIELD.

74
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:11,734
AS AMERICA SURGES FORWARD WITH

75
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:14,937
MORE JOBS THAN PEOPLE TO FILL

76
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:17,240
THEM, WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND

77
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:23,513
OFF FOOD STAMPS BECAUSE THEY

78
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:24,414
WANT TO WORK.

79
00:03:24,415 --> 00:03:27,817
THE LEFT, THEY RANT AND PROTEST

80
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:29,585
AND CREATE CHAOS.

81
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:30,453
THP.

82
00:03:30,454 --> 00:03:31,688
THEY THROW PEOPLE OUT OF

83
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:36,626
THEY EVEN GO TO CHURCH AND SAY

84
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:38,428
GOD SENT THEM TO DESTROY DONALD

85
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:43,533
ECONOMIC SUCCESS.

86
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:45,702
ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS MAKE

87
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:46,302
NOISE.

88
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:48,371
BUT IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN

89
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:49,605
BACKGROUND NOISE.

90
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:50,573
WHITE NOISE.

91
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:52,108
THE TRUTH?

92
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:53,643
NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO

93
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:54,544
THEM.

94
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:55,878
HIS NUMBERS CONTINUE TO INCREASE

95
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,647
AND HIS POPULARITY JUST KEEPS

96
00:03:57,648 --> 00:03:58,214
GOING UP.

97
00:03:58,215 --> 00:04:00,683
AFTER HE MET WITH PUTIN AND WAS

98
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:07,390
PUNISHABLE BY DEATH, HIS NUMBERS

99
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:13,129
THEIR YELLING AND SCREAMING IS

100
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,897
NOTHING BUT A DISTRACTION,

101
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:16,232
NOBODY CARES.

102
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,534
WE CARE ABOUT FOOD ON THE TABLE,

103
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:21,304
PAYING THE RENT, THE MORTGAGE,

104
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:23,406
PAYING FOR KIDS CLOTHING FOR

105
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:23,873
SCHOOL.

106
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:27,744
BUT NO, THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT

107
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:29,812
WHORES AND PORN STARS OR A

108
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:32,515
LAWYER THEY ARE SQUEEZING SO

109
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:34,984
TIGHT HE'LL CONFESS TO SINKING

110
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:42,358
WHACK-A-MOLE RUSSIA COLLUSION

111
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,193
NONSENSE AND THE HATERS CONTINUE

112
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:47,230
TO HATE, THE PRESIDENT HAS

113
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:54,537
THE 45th OUTSIDER PRESIDENT

114
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:55,872
OFTEN WORK WITHOUT THE SUPPORT

115
00:04:55,873 --> 00:04:59,108
OF HIS OWN PARTY HAS PRODUCED A

116
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:02,445
GDP THAT NO ONE THOUGHT

117
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:04,247
POSSIBLE, 4.1%.

118
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:07,316
AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO HIT THE

119
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:09,352
HIGHEST AVERAGE GROWTH RATE IN

120
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:10,453
OVER 13 YEARS.

121
00:05:10,454 --> 00:05:13,756
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY TO

122
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:16,292
THAT, BARACK, HILLARY AND ALL

123
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:18,194
YOU GENIUSES?

124
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:19,462
WE ARE FLYING FOLKS.

125
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,264
THIS IS THE AMERICA DONALD TRUMP

126
00:05:21,265 --> 00:00:00,000
HAD IN MIND WHEN HE ASKED US,
