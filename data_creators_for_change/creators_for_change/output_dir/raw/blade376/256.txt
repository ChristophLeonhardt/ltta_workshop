jazzy look you should try<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gordon I think</font>

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,179
it would see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well hello</font>

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,540
giving this opportunity my name is Miles

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,960
Dyer and I do indeed have a question for

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">you now being a part of an online</font>

8
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">community such as YouTube the greatest</font>

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,020
thing about it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the freedom of</font>

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,480
expression<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ideas of concepts and</font>

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,480
communities coming together with no fear

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you know the right thing to say but</font>

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,300
outside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front door out there in the</font>

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,850
real world as some call it there is

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,559
issues such as political correctness

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,290
which as I'm sure you are aware of has

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,230
become an increasingly more restrictive

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,750
issue over the past decade I find it

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,399
ironic that the increase of political

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,840
correctness throughout the years has

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,579
been used to help social liberties and

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,340
to protect people<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in fact it is</font>

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,530
restricted these things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> restricted</font>

24
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,570
freedom of speech so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question to you</font>

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,340
prime<font color="#E5E5E5"> minister is do you believe that</font>

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">freedom of speech has been restricted</font>

27
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,699
and political correctness has in fact

28
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,729
gone mad and if so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you think</font>

29
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,340
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done to improve this situation</font>

30
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,460
thank you

31
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,350

00:01:18,720 --> 00:00:00,000
you
