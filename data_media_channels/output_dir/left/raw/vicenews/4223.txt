1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,980
Bernie Sanders is out with a new book today

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,540
aimed at teaching young Americans
how to win in progressive politics.

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,920
And even though he himself didn’t win in 2016,

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,500
he’s leaving the door open to another run in 2020:

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,660
— Are you running again?

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,820
— Well, it’s a little bit early to be talking about that.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,080
Let’s focus on the issues
impacting the American people.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,440
— We’ll take that as a yes.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,900
— As Sanders looks towards that possibility,

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,980
he seems to be changing his strategy…

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,500
and his tone.

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,700
— In just over a year,

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,680
Bernie Sanders went from presidential primary loser

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,860
to the de-facto leader of the Democratic Party.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,480
— Let us welcome the senator from Vermont,

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,720
the Honorable Bernard Sanders!

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,400
— Recent polls show he’s the most
popular American politician.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,760
And he’s raising money without even trying—

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,180
bringing in $1.5 million in the first half of the year

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,460
by sending just four fundraising emails.

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,960
— I have been introduced on many occasions.

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,680
I can’t quite recall an introduction like that.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,520
Thank you very much.

24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,140
— He’s done this without actually
becoming a Democrat.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,720
— You are talking to the longest-serving
Independent in the history of the United States

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,820
— But he’s still sort-of embracing the
party.

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,820
— If you want to be critical of Democrats, I’m with you.

28
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,860
There’s a lot that we can criticize.

29
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,040
So the place that I am in right now is
to try to transform the Democratic Party—

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,860
to open it up to people like you!

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,100
— This is a shift from his much
more direct 2016 campaign rhetoric.

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,130
— What the system is designed to do,

33
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,320
what corporate media is designed to do,

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,600
is to tell you that we cannot achieve real change,

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,920
that the only thing you can accept
is incremental, tiny changes.

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,160
— Remember,

37
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:15,180
he’s the guy whose rabid fan-base almost derailed
last year’s Democratic National Convention.

38
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,240
Waging that campaign, divisive as it was,

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,560
earned Sanders a seat at the Democratic Party table.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,580
And he wants to keep it.

41
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,960
Even Ralph Nader,

42
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,600
an outsider presidential candidate in his own right,

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,800
understands why.

44
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,460
— I think he wants to win.

45
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,340
And short of winning,

46
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,900
to be strong enough inside the Democrat Party

47
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,200
to push them toward a more progressive agenda
and away from the Wall Street corporatist agenda.

48
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,100
— But that sort of undermines his image
as this Independent-reformer-outsider guy.

49
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,000
— No, I don’t think he’s compromised
his major agendas.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,240
I think that’s the way he lives with his conscience.

51
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
He said, “Yes, I’m on the inside.”

52
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,340
“I’m surrounded by corporate Democrats,”

53
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,280
but I’ve got a much bigger base
out there than they have,”

54
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,079
“and maybe I can push them in terms of their
own survival, in 2018 and 2020, in my direction.”

55
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,520
— There is a general national consensus

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,239
that the Democrat Party is beginning to move more

57
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,540
in our direction than in the other side’s direction.

58
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,620
— One way Sanders could pull the party in his direction

59
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,180
is by threatening to use his grassroots army
to primary challenge establishment Democrats—

60
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,220
something many of his supporters want.

61
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,220
— Do you think he should support primary challenges?

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,640
— Absolutely.

63
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,600
The primary challenges make our party better.

64
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,740
— Doesn’t that risk, though, alienating some
of the Democratic voters that he is courting?

65
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,520
— Yeah, I mean, I think what really
matters is supporting candidates

66
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,400
who are going to be in the right place on the issues.

67
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,620
— But on his biggest policy push,

68
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,999
Medicare for All,

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,220
Sanders isn’t ready to drive a wedge in the party.

70
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,600
— Would you back primary challenges to
Democrats who don’t support Medicare for All?

71
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,760
— Uh, that’s political gossip, which
I’m not particularly interested in.

72
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,540
— Well, how are you gonna move them forward?

73
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,100
— And when Sanders explains
his decision to play the long-game,

74
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,800
he now sounds more like
a politician than a revolutionary:

75
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,760
— You yourself admitted to NPR that

76
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,080
there’s no chance of it passing
with Republicans in control.

77
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,740
So why are you pushing a plan
that you think can’t pass?

78
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,660
— Now, that’s not the right question—

79
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,750
I mean, nothing that’s significant
if we want to pass,

80
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,980
and I hope and believe we will,
Medicare for All.

81
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,600
A good majority of the American people believe
we should expand Medicare to all people,

82
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,180
and we have got to organize effectively in
every state in this country to make that happen.

83
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,520
— Well, why talk about it
if you can’t get it done right now?

84
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,300
— Because that’s the way change always happens.

85
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,420
Why do you think the minimum wage now
all over this country is at $15 an hour?

86
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,840
Do you think that happened overnight?

87
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,240
People have been talking about it for a long time.

88
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,180
What about gay rights?

89
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,540
What about women’s rights?

90
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,260
Things don’t happen overnight.

91
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,100
And especially when you’re taking
on the entire political establishment,

92
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,240
you have to begin someplace.

93
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,860
And our job now is to mobilize people
to talk about the advantages,

94
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,860
the cost effectiveness,
the human right that health care is.

95
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,680
So you’ve gotta start someplace,
and that’s what we’re going to do.

96
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,180
Thank you.

97
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,860
— What do you say to Democrats
who say you’re gonna…?

98
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,120
— The thing is,

99
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,360
if Bernie is serious that he wants to get
priorities like Medicare for All done eventually,

100
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,520
he needs the Democratic Party
establishment to work with him.

101
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,580
So in April,

102
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,660
Sanders tried to appease them by joining
DNC Chairman Tom Perez on a “unity tour.”

103
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,640
It was partly designed to convince Sanders’s
supporters the DNC wasn’t totally evil.

104
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,020
It… didn’t work too well.

105
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,000
— Let me thank Tom Perez for his remarks.

106
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,220
— Boo!

107
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,020
— And Sanders can’t play too nice
with the party anyway—

108
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,690
because he built a movement railing against it.

109
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,740
He has to be careful not to lose that authenticity.

110
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,060
So just a month later,

111
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,260
when he spoke to a conference full Bernie diehards,

112
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,360
the Democratic Party was the enemy again:

113
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:58,080
— The current model and the current strategy
of the Democratic party is an absolute failure.

114
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,740
— This frenemy status drives
the party establishment crazy.

115
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,660
But Sanders knows they have to live with it…

116
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,440
— Alright, can I see that baby cow?

117
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,840
— …because the bloc he controls
is critical to their future,

118
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,540
at least through 2018.

119
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,680
— Oh my God!

120
00:06:13,880 --> 00:00:00,000
— Oh, he’s so tiny.
