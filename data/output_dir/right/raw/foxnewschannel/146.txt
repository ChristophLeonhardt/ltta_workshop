1
00:00:01,518 --> 00:00:03,052
>> IT WILL PUT MORE PRESSURE ON

2
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:04,787
THE PEOPLE GATHER AROUND THE

3
00:00:04,788 --> 00:00:05,120
TABLE.

4
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:06,422
I AM GOING TO ASK EACH OF YOU TO

5
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:14,129
COME BACK WITH A 5% BUDGET CUT

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,131
FROM YOUR DEPARTMENTS, WHETHER

7
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:18,334
IT'S THE SECRETARY           A S

8
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:18,367
IT'S THE SECRETARY           A C

9
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:18,400
IT'S THE SECRETARY           A E

10
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:18,434
IT'S THE SECRETARY           A A

11
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:18,467
IT'S THE SECRETARY           A Y

12
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:18,500
IT'S THE SECRETARY           A ,

13
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:18,534
IT'S THE SECRETARY           A A

14
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:19,101
IT'S THE SECRETARY           A N

15
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:19,702
ADMINISTRATOR, WHATEVER.

16
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:20,836
I'M GOING TO ASK EVERYBODY TO

17
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:23,539
COME BACK WITH A 5% CUT.

18
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,674
I THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO

19
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:26,976
IT.

20
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:29,178
THERE MAY BE A SPECIAL EXEMPTION

21
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:30,779
PERHAPS, I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT

22
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,313
EXEMPTION WOULD BE.

23
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:33,248
IF YOU CAN DO MORE THAN 5%, SOME

24
00:00:33,249 --> 00:00:34,917
OF YOU WILL SAY HEY, I CAN DO

25
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:37,119
MUCH MORE THAN 5%.

26
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,387
I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE PENNY

27
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:40,689
PLAN FOR 15 YEARS.

28
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,560
1 PENNY EVERY YEAR PER DOLLAR, 1

29
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:47,329
PENNY EVERY YEAR.

30
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,630
AFTER FOUR OR FIVE YEARS, THE

31
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,366
COUNTRY IS IN GOOD SHAPE.

32
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:53,135
I'M SAYING, LET'S NOT DO THE

33
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,004
PENNY PLAN, LET'S DO THE 5-PENNY

34
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:55,304
PLAN.

35
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,005
I THINK YOU CAN DO IT SO I'D

36
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:59,875
LIKE TO HAVE EVERYONE SITTING

37
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:00,943
AROUND THE TABLE, YOUR

38
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:03,812
INCREDIBLE DOMAINS YOU RESIDE

39
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,149
OVER, IN SOME CASES VERY WELL,

40
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,785
IN SOME CASES BRILLIANTLY, I

41
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:13,255
WOULD LIKE YOU TO COME BACK WITH

42
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:14,089
A 5% CUT.

43
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,893
GET RID OF THE FAT, GET RID OF

44
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:19,628
THE WAY STAND I'M SURE YOU CAN

45
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:20,729
DO IT, I'M SURE EVERYBODY IN THE

46
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,265
STAFF CAN DO IT.

47
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:24,867
IT WILL HAVE A HUGE IMPACT.

48
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:27,136
THE LAST BUDGET WE HAD TO GO

49
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:29,338
BECAUSE IT WAS MILITARY, WE HAD

50
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:29,938
TO FIX OUR MILITARY.

51
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,475
OUR MILITARY IS IN THE PROCESS

52
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:35,744
OF BEING FIXED, CHIPS ARE BEING

53
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:37,946
MADE, MISSILES, ROCKETS,

54
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:40,582
EVERYTHING.

55
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,784
OUR NUCLEAR IS BEING BROUGHT TO

56
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:43,318
A LEVEL THAT NOBODY ELSE CAN

57
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:43,752
EVEN IMAGINE.

58
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:45,721
PRAY GOD WE DON'T HAVE TO USE

59
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:47,389
IT, THAT THERE WILL BE NOTHING

60
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,924
LIKE WHAT WE HAVE, THERE IS

61
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,392
NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE HAVE AND

62
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:53,395
THAT'S WHY I DID THAT.

63
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:54,530
I MADE DEALS WITH THE DEVIL IN

64
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,666
ORDER TO GET THAT DONE BECAUSE

65
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,768
WE HAD TO IMPROVE OUR MILITARY,

66
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:00,502
OUR MILITARY WAS DEPLETED, IT

67
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,771
WAS IN BAD SHAPE.

68
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:05,641
GREAT PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY

69
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:06,375
HADN'T RECEIVED A WAGE INCREASE

70
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,144
IN MORE THAN TEN YEARS, NOW THEY

71
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:10,546
ARE GETTING AN INCREASE, FIRST

72
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,981
TIME IN MORE THAN TEN YEARS.

73
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:14,216
SO I WANTED TO DO THAT AND IN

74
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,853
ORDER TO GET THAT DONE, BECAUSE

75
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:19,354
THE DEMOCRATS WON'T VOTE FOR THE

76
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:22,024
MILITARY, THEY DON'T LIKE

77
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:23,926
LAW ENFORCEMENT, THEY DON'T LIKE

78
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:24,393
BORDERS.

79
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,994
WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE

80
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:27,329
BORDER, PEOPLE ARE COMING IN

81
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,330
OPEN CARAVANS AND WE HAD TO STOP

82
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:31,867
THEM EVEN THOUGH THE LAWS ARE

83
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:32,234
TERRIBLE.

84
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,001
OUR LAWS ARE TERRIBLE.

85
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:34,870
THEY ARE A LAUGHING STOCK ALL

86
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:36,371
OVER THE WORLD AND WE ARE

87
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:38,440
SUPPOSED TO STOP PEOPLE WITH

88
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:40,342
LAWS THAT AREN'T VERY GOOD BUT

89
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:41,310
WERE DOING BETTER THAN ANYBODY

90
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,246
ELSE COULD POSSIBLY EVEN THINK

91
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:44,513
OF.

92
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:45,481
I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO COME BACK

93
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:50,853
WITH A 5% CUT AND I THINK IF YOU

94
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:53,088
CAN DO MORE THAN THAT, I WILL BE

95
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:53,755
VERY HAPPY.

96
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,556
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE SITTING AT

97
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:57,759
THE TABLE, SOME PEOPLE THAT CAN

98
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,460
REALLY DO SUBSTANTIALLY MORE

99
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,762
THAN THAT.

100
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,431
BECAUSE NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR

101
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,600
MILITARY TAKEN CARE OF, WE HAVE

102
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,567
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT TAKEN CARE

103
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:07,169
OF, WE CAN DO THINGS WE WEREN'T

104
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,138
INTO IN A POSITION TO DO WHEN I

105
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,272
FIRST CAME.

106
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,207
I WILL SEE YOU AT THE NEXT

107
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:12,975
MEETING, I WILL SEE YOU MANY

108
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:16,945
TIMES BEFORE.

109
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,347
THAT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT

110
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:20,582
REQUEST I AM MAKING OF EVERYBODY

111
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,384
SITTING AROUND THIS TABLE.

112
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:23,986
IT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

113
00:03:23,987 --> 00:03:25,654
MONEY AND IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN

114
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:27,990
DO AND I BELIEVE WE CAN ACTUALLY

115
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:29,024
DO IT EASILY.

116
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:31,226
RATHER THAN GO BY THE PENNY

117
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:32,427
PLAN, CALL IT THE NICKEL PLAN.

118
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,830
IT WILL BE A ONE-YEAR NICKEL

119
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:36,431
PLAN, WE MAY DO ANOTHER NICKEL

120
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:39,168
PLAN NEXT YEAR, TOO.

121
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,669
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH, TO THE

122
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,871
PRESS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

123
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:46,575
WE KNOW WHAT THE NEW BUDGET IS,

124
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:50,312
IT WILL PROBABLY BE

125
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,949
$700 BILLION.

126
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,983
716, 700, THAT'S A VERY

127
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,854
SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER, IT'S VERY

128
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:00,556
IMPORTANT, WITHOUT DEFENSE,

129
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:02,090
MAYBE THE REST OF IT DOESN'T

130
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:02,558
MEAN VERY MUCH.

131
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,893
IF YOU KNOW IT WAS AT 520 A VERY

132
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:07,529
SHORT WHILE AGO AND THE REASON I

133
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,165
BROUGHT IT UP TO 70716 WAS TO

134
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,368
BUILD NEW SHIPS, BUILDING NEW

135
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:15,170
INCREDIBLE SUBMARINES, THE

136
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,471
FINEST IN THE WORLD, MOST

137
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:18,573
POWERFUL IN THE WORLD.

138
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:21,476
ANYWHERE EVER, DOING THINGS THAT

139
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:22,411
WE HAVE NEVER DONE ON THIS

140
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:25,047
SCALE.

141
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:28,617
THAT INCLUDED A LOT OF

142
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:30,552
REBUILDING OF OUR MILITARY.

143
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:32,554
DESPITE THAT, I AM GOING TO KEEP

144
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:36,124
THAT AT $700 BILLION, DEFENSE.

145
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:41,563
OKAY?

146
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:43,398
>> THEY ARE INVESTIGATING

147
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,166
THEMSELVES, ESSENTIALLY.

148
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,868
>> THEY ARE GREAT, VERY TALENTED

149
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,202
PEOPLE.

150
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:47,903
THEY'VE NOW BEEN HERE LONG

151
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:51,006
ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS,

152
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,175
THEY ARE -- IT'S A GREAT GROUP

153
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:54,209
AROUND THIS TABLE, IT'S A GREAT

154
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,511
GROUP AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DO

155
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:56,778
IT.

156
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:57,746
AND WHEN YOU ADD TO THIS AND

157
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:00,349
COUPLE THIS WITH WHAT LARRY

158
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,151
KUDLOW SAID ABOUT HOW WELL WERE

159
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:06,154
DOING -- WHERE IS LARRY?

160
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:06,622
>> HERE HE IS.

161
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:09,992
>> LARRY HAS TO BE VERY HAPPY,

162
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:10,993
YOU DIDN'T EVEN EXPECT THIS.

163
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:13,795
DID YOU EXPECT THIS?

164
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:14,663
>> IT'S HAPPENING BIGGER AND

165
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:17,099
FASTER THAN I THOUGHT.

166
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,967
>> THIS IS PART OF IT, THIS IS

167
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:20,402
ALL PART OF IT.

168
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,771
I COULDN'T DO IT LAST YEAR, I

169
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:24,139
HAD TO DO THE MILITARY.

170
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,340
OUR MILITARY WAS IN REALLY BAD

171
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:30,946
SHAPE, PLANES THAT COULDN'T FLY,

172
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:31,780
MILITARY THAT WAS IN A

173
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,549
RIDICULOUS SITUATION.

174
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,018
SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAD TO DO.

175
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,420
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS THEY ARE

176
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:38,954
DOING IT THEMSELVES.

177
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:45,994
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

178
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:47,496
>> YOU TOLD HIM YOU ARE NOT

179
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:47,896
READY YET.

180
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:48,797
>> I TOLD THEM THEY'RE NOT

181
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:52,968
READY.

182
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:54,336
WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA, JUST SO

183
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:54,970
YOU UNDERSTAND.

184
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:58,106
OUR COUNTRY HAS REBUILT CHINA,

185
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,575
WITH THEIR HARD WORK IN GENIUS,

186
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:00,876
