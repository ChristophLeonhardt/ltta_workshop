1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,470
There are two kinds of people in this world.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,500
Ones who see this painting and think: genius.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,900
And ones who think: how did Jackson Pollock
get so overrated?

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,900
Wait, a second Jackson.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,940
I am actually the first type.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,230
The type that really likes you.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,410
Don’t put that cigarette out in my eye.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,019
I love abstract expressionism and I love Pollock.

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,200
When I see Pollock in person, I am full on
Cameron in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,360
What time is it?

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,000
But even fans like me have to admit that Pollock
brings up questions.

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,450
Questions beyond snark about why Jackson Pollock’s
studio floor looks identical to his paintings.

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,060
Why is Pollock the one who gets his paintings
put under a microscope?

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,820
Why does Pollock get to be Ed Harris’s passion
project?

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,300
There’s one answer that’s beyond the paint.

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,800
This is artist Lee Krasner, Jackson Pollock’s
wife, and Jackson, enjoying time in Springs,

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,440
New York.

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:20,729
But it’s the man in between them who might
be the key to understanding how Jackson Pollock

19
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:21,980
became a legend.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,800
Here’s a young Jackson Pollock at his mentor,
Thomas Hart Benton’s, house.

21
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,060
Yep, he has a drink in his hand.

22
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,820
Most people agree Pollock’s big break came
in 1943, with “Mural,” which he painted

23
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:44,890
for heiress Peggy Guggenheim.

24
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,189
It’s got bold colors and motion.

25
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:53,740
Pollock later said it was like “a stampede
of every animal in the American West.”

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,060
Pollock’s birthplace of Cody, Wyoming helped
sell that.

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,700
Later he pioneered placing the canvas on the
ground and throwing paint down at it.

28
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,340
That helped him become a mainstream success,
with Life Magazine articles and Vogue fashion

29
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:17,310
shoots with his paintings in the background,
as well as the classic, icon-building Hans

30
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,550
Namuth film and photos that showed the brooding
cowboy artist at work.

31
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,980
“I usually paint on the floor.

32
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,860
I enjoy working on a large canvas.”

33
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,970
But here’s the problem.

34
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,930
If you don’t get Jackson Pollock, it's not that
straightforward.

35
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,380
Why was he the one who made it big in a crowded
field?

36
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:43,460
In 1951, Life Magazine published an article
about all the big art stars in America.

37
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,890
There are a lot of future museum staples in
there, like Mark Rothko, de Kooning, and Clyfford

38
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,440
Still.

39
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,300
But Pollock?

40
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,120
He’s in the middle.

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,140
To understand why, you’ve got to return
to the center of that other picture.

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,700
In 1933, Clement Greenberg — friends called
him Clem — was a necktie salesman.

43
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,792
He became the most influential art critic
of the 20th century.

44
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:21,269
In a small New York art scene where artists
and critics partied together, that made him

45
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,430
an eye on a hidden world.

46
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,190
It’s important to put into context how influential
Greenberg was thanks to articles in the Partisan

47
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,970
Review and the Nation.

48
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,569
Let’s use Ferris Bueller as example.

49
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:39,180
Millions of people know every scene of this
movie, but not as many know that it’s a

50
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,690
John Hughes movie.

51
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,280
Now any movie fan knows John Hughes was the
teen movie God.

52
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,890
But many movie watchers just don’t.

53
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,400
That’s a little like Clement Greenberg.

54
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,640
He was enormously influential in the art world,
but remains obscure to a wider audience.

55
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,450
He broke through with the 1939 essay “Avant
Garde and Kitsch,” in which he proposed

56
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,420
that art was a bulwark against mass culture.

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,238
He was a newbie to art - that Avant Garde
and Kitsch essay referenced a painting that

58
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,589
didn’t exist.

59
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:22,750
Later, in a famous mistake, he said this painting
had orange and purple in it.

60
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,420
It doesn't.

61
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:29,260
If you know that artist Piet Mondrian narrowed
himself to primary colors, the blooper is

62
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,430
even worse.

63
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,880
Still, some painters respected him.

64
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,840
Robert Motherwell said, “I disagreed with
him about many things but he had a painter's

65
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,340
eye.

66
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,000
And none of the other critics did; not one.

67
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,759
So as a direct intuition he got it right off
the bat."

68
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,070
That eye advanced an aggressive vision of
modern painting that said the buzz wasn’t

69
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,650
in Paris, but New York.

70
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,389
And the perfect American?

71
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:58,600
The cowboy who happened to look a lot like
Clement Greenberg.

72
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,200
OK, that’s a little unfair.

73
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,210
But seriously?

74
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,710
This is like that meme: “You Vs.

75
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,560
The Guy She Told You Not To Worry About.”

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,960
And it’s true that Greenberg’s abrasive,
American-centric, hypermasculine view of art

77
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,690
worked better with Pollock than with a Dutch
immigrant like de Kooning, who noodled over

78
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,350
his paintings obsessively.

79
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,740
In his essay “American Type Painting,”
Greenberg wrote that Pollock was “alone

80
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:35,000
in his power to assert a paint-strewn or paint-laden
surface as a single synoptic image.”

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,509
Pollock “pulverized” the canvas - when
he changed his mind, he made “violent repentance.”

82
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:46,740
Throughout the 1940s, Greenberg and Pollock
rose together, while slightly less renowned

83
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,350
critics popped up around them.

84
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,000
Greenberg was the brain, Pollock was the soul.

85
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,580
This cheerleading from 1947 was typical, in
which Greenberg called Pollock “radically

86
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,800
American,” and the most “Powerful painter
in contemporary America.”

87
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,250
That praise bubbled to the mainstream.

88
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,900
That Life magazine article from 1948, the
one that made Pollock as mainstream as the

89
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,600
cheese platter ad on the next page?

90
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,009
The entire basis for that article was a “formidably
high-brow New York critic.”

91
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:23,990
The New York art scene knew that Clement Greenberg.

92
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,120
But the rest of the country saw the new star
at the top of the page.

93
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:34,760
Helen Frankenthaler didn’t drip paint like
Jackson Pollock.

94
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:41,449
She soaked and stained her canvases, resulting
in haunting images like Mountains and Sea.

95
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:46,610
This is her in the middle, with Jackson Pollock,
Clement Greenberg, and Lee Krasner.

96
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,979
Greenberg and Frankenthaler saw each other
for about five years.

97
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:56,419
Frankenthaler later said that her dating Greenberg
was one of the reasons that he rarely wrote

98
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:57,880
about her work.

99
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,630
Greenberg helped make museum names out of
Clyfford Still, and Barnett Newman, and Mark

100
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,780
Rothko, but he missed many movements and artists.

101
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,600
That had consequences.

102
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,500
Frankenthaler is a legend, a mainstream name.

103
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,479
But she’s famous the way Clement Greenberg
is famous, not the way Jackson Pollock is.

104
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,789
And she is kind of a symbol for all the artists
whose careers Greenberg made — or overlooked.

105
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:29,410
One critic shaped how we look at a half-century
of painting.

106
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,910
If Pollock was overrated, Clement Greenberg
was the one doing it.

107
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,160
We just followed his lead.

108
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,650
So what is the correction here?

109
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:43,580
It’s not to discount Jackson Pollock, it’s
to give more attention to those other abstract

110
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,140
expressionists as well.

111
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,620
And to know the critic who decided which names
we’d learn.

112
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,720
With that in mind, maybe it’s possible to
come up with more than just Jackson Pollock’s

113
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,220
name.

114
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,080
“Anyone?

115
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,960
“Anyone?

116
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,900
Anyone?”

117
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,599
So, if you want to learn more about Clem,
I really recommend Florence Rubenfeld’s

118
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,599
book about him.

119
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,420
It gives you an entire new angle on a half
century of American art, and it features a

120
00:08:17,420 --> 00:00:00,000
surprising number of fist fights.
