labeling people is in fashion has been for the past couple of years in fact populist mainstream deplorable Lib Todd or when it comes to Syria and assadist like a sadist but who also supports the Syrian president at least that seems to be the logic behind an index of names recently clawed together I chose primarily this term rather than the narrower term pro-assad because some of the public figures in this list explicitly deny being pro-assad but still persistently repeat core lines of regime propaganda narratives Steve ban and Glenn Greenwald Boris Johnson norm Tomsky let's say the chances of coming across any other list banding these people together are slim you published an article full of lies because you're too lazy and or malicious to care that you're doing it I never defended the Assad regime in my life this is astonishing I mean a useful directory of people defending their sad regime what an absolute joke in fact the author was quite meticulous coming up with a 10-point quote-unquote scale of Assad ISM and having read through those I figured that maybe I should offer my humble assistance in completing this list as by no means does it look finished take this point implying the West has somehow supported al-nusrah or Isis I think we're backing people we have no idea who they are the rebels we call them the rebels the patriotic rebels we have no idea a lot of people think you that they're Isis another benchmark assuming that for minorities Assad and Islamic cutthroats are the same thing the former US vice president is among those who doesn't believe in a post-assad Thomas Jefferson we Americans think in every country in transition there's a Thomas Jefferson High DB sign hung with some rock or a James Madison Beyond once and you in Syria there was no moderate Navabi but this is small-caliber really so v added what only two people that brings it up to just 153 names and the index how about expanding it with the whole staff of the US State Department they denied entry to the leader of the white helmets over security concerns and after all being mean to them is a capital offense to any individual in any group suspected of ties or relations with extremist groups or that we have believed to be a security threat to the United States we've been act accordingly but as for those who are already on the list we've interviewed a couple of them document is is ridiculous in many ways but it's also deeply weighing and concerning but it is part of a witch-hunt against people who don't accept the government line on military intervention in the Middle East support is based on no facts whatsoever really it takes no account whatsoever of my actual views on Syria what we're looking at here just with this blacklist is something published by someone who we had never heard of before totally obscure figure this is just like comical level of research and it's being promoted by the same people who have been not only promoting Western intervention in Syria but who have been dedicated for the past two years to attacking and smearing anyone who gets in their way the author of the list was a bit of nobody before giving man birth to his catalog but as its popularity swells let the public shaming commence you
