when Donald Trump was on the campaign trail he pretended to be an economic populist and even for the few months of his presidency he kind of doubled down on that charade so I want to refresh everybody's memory about this let's take a look at the video so we're gonna turn things around we're gonna turn them around fast we're not gonna lose carrier Air Conditioning we're not gonna let that happen when people and countries take our companies and take our jobs they're gonna be consequences they're not gonna take them because we're not gonna let carrier come in make air conditioners in Mexico sell the air conditioners to us across a very strong border now without consequence and when we explained to the heads of carrier that here's the story either stay or if you want to go to Mexico we wish you a lot of luck but when you sell your air conditioners you're gonna pay a 35% tax as those air conditioners cross the border and you know what's gonna happen they're not gonna move they're not gonna move but we're not gonna let them just take our companies out fire everybody these are people with carrier for many many years we're not gonna let it happen so let me just say right off the bat here I you know that was strong rhetoric and I think that had a lot to do with why he won the election because all he had to do was chip away in the Rust Belt which he did he was over there talking about how NAFTA was terrible and all your jobs were shipped out and he really ran a strong economic populist campaign now he was lying as I'm about to get to in a second but that kind of rhetoric if he'd delivered on that kind of stuff he would have gotten guff let's say from the corporate Democrats non-stop but they would have been wrong because that's that's protectionism and we need a lot more of that because we keep outsourcing jobs everywhere else and they're building sweatshops and all that stuff but I want to refresh everybody's memory a little further so the hill explains here in December 2016 United Technologies announced it had reached a deal with then president-elect Trump to keep about 1,000 jobs at a carrier manufacturing plant in Indiana that were slated to move to Mexico the company also pledged to invest 16 million dollars in the plan the company received millions of dollars in breaks over ten years to keep the jobs in the US okay so you know here's where we're starting to see the charade fall apart because he's rolling out the red carpet and basically giving them giant subsidies in order for them to keep the jobs here well it gets even worse last July the plant laid off 300 workers at the Indianapolis facility and in November the company announced it would lay off more than 200 additional employees at the plant okay still not done with how bad it gets listen to this United Technologies was recently awarded a two point five billion dollar Department of Defense contract with no competition according to a new report so look at what happened here Trump got together with United Technologies and carrier behind closed doors and said listen how can we make it look like I'm an economic populist while me still giving you whatever you want so at the end of the day he made a deal with them where he said keep the jobs here for a few months maybe a year whatever when nobody's looking ship the jobs overseas and I'm gonna give you a giant subsidy a lot of taxpayer money and then I'm gonna give you a 2.5 billion dollar deal with the Pentagon so this is hose the taxpayers hose the workers all while pretending to be an economic populist so in other words he's a liar and he's a fake populist and if the Democrats run an actual populist against Donald Trump they'll win in a historic landslide so now I have given Donald Trump a little bit of credit on this when he initially announced the deal and I'll tell you why I am the credit and why I am completely retracting that now because you have to be open to facts and not just go with your prejudged opinions so I don't like Donald Trump I voted against them I fought against them tooth and nail during elections but when he said I'm gonna take away TPP I was like well I like that ya know and and he did and I said my guess is he'll bring it back and I say he'll negotiate a better deal and he just said that exactly okay so now but for the moment we don't have TPP if he kept that up we'd give him credit he slipped provisions of it into the renegotiation of NAFTA though the worst provisions of TPP slipped him right back into the renegotiations of NAFTA right now in the carrier deal when during the transition when he's about to come into office they announce the deal where he he they said they wouldn't keep the thousand jobs but what Trump did that the corporate Democrats and the media complained about was he said look you guys get a lot of government contracts maybe I don't give you those government contracts so you better keep those jobs here and everybody cried about that I was like no I like that yeah I want the president to be a tough guy I wish Obama had done that I want him to say hey you want government contracts then you better have US workers getting the jobs it's not that complicated I would do that in a second oh well technically this right but it turns out it was all a lie so those jobs are now gone but carrier got the tax breaks anyway and they do add an extra 16 million ounces they were supposed to as part of the deal invested in the facilities you know what they did there Oh CEO admits they invested it in automation which means cutting your jobs oh okay so the I mean you want to her about an insult to entry and then they ship your jobs abroad anyway and then on top of that Trump gave them a two and a half billion dollar defense contract a another insult to injury it was a no-bid contract so no free market no competition we have a crooked deal not to keep the workers here if they was Kyle and I would be in favor of it in fact we made videos in favor of it right but no the deal was you give Trump good marketing that's a lie and then later I'll let you fire anyone you like and give you a multi-billion dollar no big contract on top that is disgusting he's a liar that's what he is he's a liar he said repeatedly on the campaign trail and he tweeted about it non-stop I'm not gonna cut your Social Security Medicare I'm not gonna cut it Mike Huckabee stole that from me he's saying he's not gonna cut it I told you I'm not gonna cut it first I said it first well guess what he already proposed cutting it in the tax bill they already cut it so he's just a liar you need to get that through your head and the Democrats need to understand you can easily beat him if you just run a populist in 2020 yeah you know what if you're a progressive you don't have to lie about those things and one last thing you you've got the Republicans and a terrible right-wing Republican line Donald Trump who uses racism and bigotry and all that stuff adopting progressive positions to win the election he doesn't actually do it but he's at least smart enough to know and it doesn't take much to know it just read the polls they're overwhelmingly the country's overwhelmingly in favor of those progressive positions and the idiot corporate Democrats we gotta run to the right run to the right oh my god we're too progressive we gotta run to the right and they let him steal progressive positions right from underneath their nose and pretend to be a progressive and they never even called about on it yeah all they did was like Trump's a bad guy Trump's a bad guy well they argued no no they argued your your rhetoric is bad about cracking down on corporations for shipping jobs overseas when they should have been the ones making the argument no we are gonna do protectionism we are gonna keep your jobs here so they fall for the trap they're still falling for right now after Hillary Clinton's loss what did they say they said all Bernie pushed her too far to the left Oh perhaps of oestrus but Bernie was against the TPP and Hillary was for the TPP and a hundred other examples I can give you and it turns out they voted for the candidate who are gay who was against TPP and against those trade deals if you don't go populist left you will get populist right and that is the disaster we're living in right now fake populist right but yes if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network calm slash join and once you do you'll be saying get on like a smart person or you
