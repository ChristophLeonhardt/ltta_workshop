Israel has evacuated hundreds of members of the controversial white helmets group and their families to neighboring Jordan after Canada Britain and Germany reportedly agreed to accept at least some of them as refugees that's after Syrian government forces launched an offensive against militants in the south of the country where members of the group were located upon request of the US Canada and European states Israel has completed a humanitarian effort to rescue members of a Syrian civil organization the white helmets and families they were evacuated from the war zone in southern Syria to a neighboring country now the IDF has caught us to quote an exceptional humanitarian gesture it has said that it carried out this evacuation at the request of the United States and several European countries and that the requests already came several weeks ago activists belonging to D white helmets consider themselves rescuers who risk their lives to help save civilians but the organization remains controversial particularly over where its funding comes most of its funding is from the West and as such it is criticized as being an organization that promotes a Western interventionist agenda for example more than thirty two million dollars comes from the United States it also receives funding from the Netherlands from Denmark Germany Canada and New Zealand now we're still waiting for Russian reaction but when the first reports emerged a few days ago over this planned evacuation the Russian Foreign Ministry said that there was concern over so-called provocations that could happen during such a move but me she's in pharmacy according to the information we have the white helmets convoy arrived in the town of adlib and among the arrivals for several chemical experts missiles and missile parts were also unloaded we do not rule out the possibility that these shall we say souvenirs unloaded by the white helmets will be used as intended or even when is announced that this member so the white helmets have been evacuated from the region we cannot allow the possibility of large-scale provocation and pinning the blame for this prayer occasion on the Syrian government now with all these controversies surrounding the white helmets there certainly are risks and could be more risks around this evacuation in addition to the evacuation of the white helmets the area has seen hundreds of militants and their families moved to the rebel-held north the evacuation comes as the Syrian army advances along the country's southern border with Jordan the area has long been held by Western backed militants seeking to overthrow overthrow President Assad live now to Vanessa be Li who's an independent investigative journalist now Russia's foreign ministry suggested that the white helmets could be preparing a provocation in Syria's north have warnings like this been taken into consideration by Western countries do you think well I'm not sure they would exactly be taken into consideration unless of course they are being considered to protect the Western regime change operation inside Syria in that case they would be very clearly be taken into consideration as they were in hongcheon in April 2017 after Tillison had announced that Assad should stay I think within 24 hours the primarily British financed white helmets led the narrative on the alleged chemical attack in Honshu who and then later obviously in eastern gutter which was another liberation campaign by the Syrian army and its allies it was the white helmets who produced the now discredited chemical provocation in eastern Ghouta discredited of course by the interim OPCW report that has announced that no siren was used and only chlorinated elements that could have their origin and in household items so it the OPCW report has largely raised the question of the credibility of the white helmets reports from inside Syria why do you think the credibility that's been questioned by others is being ignored in this evacuation well I mean this is as though as the IDF of announce this is an exceptional evacuation it's an exceptional evacuation for an exceptional organization created by the Exceptionalist regimes in the United States and in the UK and in the EU the NATO member states but also supported by particularly Qatar and Saudi Arabia so what we've seen here is the evacuation of this alleged humanitarian group well of course the Israeli occupier of Palestine has recently murdered medics in Gaza and is continuing its ethnic cleansing program against Palestinian civilians however it gives an exceptional passage to the white helmets and and you know the numbers of 800 white helmets and their families seem very big considering the number of white helmets that would probably be in the South so how do we know that they are not evacuating armed fighters that we know who have been acting as custodial guardians of illegally annexed Israeli territory in that province in the southern province and that these militants are not simply donning a white helmet uniform or helmet in order to cross the border to safety in Jordan how many special forces NATO Special Forces are among those who are being exceptionally evacuated from the southern provinces before the Syrian Arab army fully liberated those areas we also saw this an Easter leper by the way and an Eastern Goethe we saw protests by the UN agencies or demand rather that the white helmets be evacuated and given priority in effect over civilians and that's what we're seeing now we're saying Syrian civilians being laughed at the border of Israel and the border of Jordan while the white helmets are again being given exceptional progress through those two countries and on to the countries that are supposedly going to host them now just to point out the reports that it was initially 800 white helmets members were evacuated that has now been reduced to just over 400 but you are right that we also have reports saying that in addition to them there's also hundreds of militants and their families being moved to the north well the international coalition continue to help allies that are losing ground in Syria then I think that's a that's a very good question I mean I think we've seen the majority of the militant and armed forces and those include of course nostra France al-qaeda and are a number of rebranding monikers that have been moved up to Edler we know that Ed Loeb is now shall we say largely ready for a liberation campaign as we've seen the evacuation of civilians from Caffe m4 in the last few days seven thousand civilians have left the besieged areas or villages of cafe m4 and we know that EDF is effectively sort of a terrorist central area or hub inside Syria and therefore there is an expected liberation campaign we saw the u.s. basically abandoned its military proxies in the south when the Syrian Arab army closed in to liberate those areas I suspect that they will probably do the same in Edler I cannot see the United States committing military forces or resources to those terrorist factions or militant factions in the northwest well we've just had Trump and Putin agreeing to work on delivering humanitarian aid to Syria to ease the country's crisis however do you think that conflicting views when it comes to Syria could hinder that aid delivery the two are likely to disagree on what's happening even today well I mean I think since the Russian intervention in September 2015 we've seen Russia consistently provide humanitarian aid broker the amnesty and reconciliation deals in the areas on deliberation such as Eastern go to East Aleppo and now the southern provinces I'm to guarantee cease fires - going - moving forward into reintegration of those artifacts back into Syrian society so I don't think there is any question over the Russian involvement in humanitarian aid inside Syria it's consistently been very successful however what we've seen of the US version of humanitarian aid has of course been demonstrated by the operation in Aleppo which led to the deaths of civilians the starvation of civilians and the continuing deaths of civilians with the with the issues with mines that were left behind by Isis when they fled the area so conflicting agendas inside Syria I yeah it's difficult to see Syria sorry Russia and the United States working cohesively on humanitarian projects inside Syria for the severely independent investigative journalists thank you so much for your time
