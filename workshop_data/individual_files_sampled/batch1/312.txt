Barbara Bush often dismissed their popularity saying it was simply because she looked like everybody's grandmother with her signature white here in peril necklace but she will be remembered as one of only two women in US history to be married to a president so help me God and the mother to one United States she was just 16 years old when she met George HW Bush at a Christmas dance both born to privilege she would later drop out of college and marry the young Navy pilot home from World War two they would settle down in Texas so he could make his fortune in the oil business but their growing family would soon face tragedy the three-year-old daughter died after a fight with leukemia she said she clung to her children even more after that four boys and another girl would grew up watching their father's political career which would ultimately lead to the White House leaving hard the rule of disciplinarian George is so you know anything they do is all right but someone has to be sure that the standards are kept and he he leads by example I lead by denying some things and I am the enforcer there's no question about it there is no question of her loyalty either anyone who did criticize her children but even washed her husband would quickly face her quick wit and icy stare she didn't want her husband or her son George to run for the presidency admits she didn't think they would win that she made news when speculation turned to another son Jeb no question in my mind that Jeb is the best qualified person to run for president but I hope he won't because I think he'll get all my enemies all his brothers all and there are other families I refuse to accept that this great country isn't raising other wonderful people thank you all for that warm welcome a reluctant matriarch of a political dynasty the first wife to speak at a political convention but beyond the campaign she wasn't known to give either her husband or son political advice in office she advocated for Family Literacy but mostly she prided herself on her family that she said was a true legacy I think they feel loved and I hope if I have a legacy other than being the enforcer that it will be the I raced along with George a great family a family that will be remembered along with the woman at the center of it
