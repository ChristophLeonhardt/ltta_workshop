00:00:07,393 --> 00:00:09,128
REPORTER AMY SPENT MORE TIME

3
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:09,895
COVERING HILLARY CLINTON

4
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:11,564
THAN ANY LIVING PERSON.

5
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:12,631
THROUGH TWO PRESIDENTIAL

6
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:13,933
CAMPAIGNS AND A DECADE SHE

7
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:15,668
HAS A NEW BOOK OUT CALLED

8
00:00:15,668 --> 00:00:16,936
CHASING HILLARY, 10 YEARS,

9
00:00:16,936 --> 00:00:20,539
TWO CAMPAIGNS ONE INTACT

10
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:21,840
GLASS CEILING DESCRIBE AS

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,442
LOT ABOUT HILLARY PROFANE

12
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:24,443
TIRADES AGAINST TRUMP.

13
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:26,178
WHOP DER HOW MANY MEN

14
00:00:26,178 --> 00:00:27,479
ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

15
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:29,882
SURROUNDED CLINTON.

16
00:00:29,882 --> 00:00:34,053
SHE SAYS SHE WAS BY HILLARY.

17
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:36,288
THANKS FOR COMING ON.

18
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:37,723
YOU HAVE TAKEN GRIEF FOR

19
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:38,457
THIS BOOK FROM THE RIGHT

20
00:00:38,457 --> 00:00:40,259
THAT SAYS YOU CONCEDE IN THE

21
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,694
BOOK THAT HAD YOU AFFINITY

22
00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:43,529
FOR HILLARY, YOU SHARE HER

23
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:43,896
POLITICS.

24
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:44,964
I WANT TO SAY AT THE OUTSET

25
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:46,065
I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU

26
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:48,267
WERE HONEST ABOUT IT UNLIKE

27
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:48,968
A LOT OF REPORTERS YOU HAVE

28
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:49,335
TO GUESS.

29
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:51,971
YOU WERE DIRECT AND I

30
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:54,306
APPRECIATE IT GIVEN THAT THE

31
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:55,107
MILLER PEOPLE ARE SNIPING

32
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:55,975
ABOUT YOU AND COMPLAINING

33
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:57,376
ABOUT YOU LIKE YOU ARE THE

34
00:00:57,376 --> 00:00:58,043
PROBLEM.

35
00:00:58,043 --> 00:00:58,377
WHY?

36
00:00:58,377 --> 00:00:59,645
SEEMS TO SAY A LOT ABOUT

37
00:00:59,645 --> 00:00:59,945
THEM.

38
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:00,946
>> EXACTLY.

39
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:01,747
APPARENTLY THIS IS THE BOOK

40
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:02,615
THAT THE CLINTONS DON'T WANT

41
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:03,382
YOU TO READ.

42
00:01:03,382 --> 00:01:05,618
AS YOU POINT OUT IT IS

43
00:01:05,618 --> 00:01:07,186
PARTLY SYMPATHETIC TO HER.

44
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:08,754
I ANTICIPATED THE BLOW BACK.

45
00:01:08,754 --> 00:01:10,222
PART OF WHAT I GET INTO IN

46
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:11,790
THE BOOK IS THAT THERE IS NO

47
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,958
GRAY AREA FOR HILLARY

48
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,361
CLINTON, YOU ARE EITHER

49
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:16,829
COMPLETELY DEVOTED TO HER OR

50
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:17,429
AN ENEMY.

51
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:18,998
A LOT OF THE TIME MY

52
00:01:18,998 --> 00:01:19,965
COVERAGE WAS IN BETWEEN.

53
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:21,200
AND SOMETIMES I WROTE SOME

54
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,700
TOUGH STORIES.

55
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,901
I WAS THE BEAT REPORTER

56
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:23,902
COVERING THIS CAMPAIGN DAY

57
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:24,937
IN AND DAY OUT.

58
00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:25,938
SO, YOU KNOW, THERE WASN'T A

59
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:26,972
LOT OF GRAY AREA.

60
00:01:26,972 --> 00:01:28,140
YOU WERE EITHER THE ENEMY OR

61
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,675
YOU WERE, YOU KNOW,

62
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:30,943
COMPLETELY DEVOTED.

63
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:31,844
>> Tucker: BUT I MEAN, HOW

64
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:32,811
SORT OF OUT OF IT DO YOU

65
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:36,649
HAVE TO BE AND I KNOW THE

66
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:38,117
CLINTON PEOPLE FEEL THIS WAY

67
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:39,084
THINK THE "NEW YORK TIMES"

68
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:40,319
IS TOO RIGHT WING TO COVER

69
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:40,986
HILLARY CLINTON.

70
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:42,154
THEY HAVE SAID THAT TO ME SO

71
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:43,155
I KNOW THEY ACTUALLY FEEL

72
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:44,123
THAT WAY.

73
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:45,658
WHAT PLANET ARE THEY ON.

74
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:47,126
>> THEY ARE ON PLANET

75
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:48,794
HILLARY WHICH I HAVE WRITTEN

76
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:50,629
ABOUT EXTENSIVELY.

77
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:51,664
ONE OF THE THEMES IN THE

78
00:01:51,664 --> 00:01:53,098
BOOK THAT YOUR VIEWERS WILL

79
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:54,667
FIND SURPRISING DECADES LONG

80
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:55,467
BATTLE BETWEEN THE "NEW YORK

81
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:57,269
TIMES" AND THE CLINTON CAMP,

82
00:01:57,269 --> 00:01:58,737
SOMETHING I WAS MY EABOUT

83
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:00,039
WHEN I WAS PUT ON THE BEAT

84
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:00,506
IN 2013.

85
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:01,840
I HADN'T ANTICIPATED THAT

86
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,075
HER AIDS WOULD ESSENTIALLY

87
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:05,344
BLAME ME FOR THE WHITE WATER

88
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:06,412
SCANDAL WHICH, TUCKER,

89
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:07,813
HAPPENED WHEN I WAS 12.

90
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:09,080
BUT THERE IS ALL THIS WHICH,

91
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,181
OF COURSE, THE "NEW YORK

92
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:11,550
TIMES" BROKE.

93
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,285
THERE IS ALL THIS BAD BLOOD

94
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:14,687
PASSED ON BETWEEN THE CLINTS

95
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:15,387
AND "NEW YORK TIMES" FROM

96
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:18,891
GENERATION TO GENERATION OF

97
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:20,526
WHICH I WAS A RECIPIENT PUT

98
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:21,827
ON HER 2016 CAMPAIGN.

99
00:02:21,827 --> 00:02:23,062
I THINK IT WOULD SURPRISE A

100
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:24,897
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THAT AN

101
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:26,165
NO,

102
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:26,198
AN,

103
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:29,401
ANIMOSITY EXISTS.

104
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:31,470
>> Tucker: CHELSEA IS MAD AT

105
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:31,904
AT YOU.

106
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:33,706
>> CHELSEA SENT 30 TWEETS IN

107
00:02:33,706 --> 00:02:35,140
THE PAST FEW DAYS

108
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,041
CRITICIZING SOME OF MY

109
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,376
REPORTING.

110
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:38,077
>> Tucker: LET ME ASK YOU A

111
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:38,444
QUESTION.

112
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:41,380
SO YOU SAID IN THE BOOK I

113
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,048
THINK I KNEW THIS

114
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:44,149
OVERWHELMING BEAT REPORTER

115
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:46,719
COVERING HILLARY WAS A

116
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,586
WOMEN.

117
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:48,153
HILLARY WAS RUNNING A

118
00:02:48,153 --> 00:02:52,124
CAMPAIGN IF SHE

119
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:52,157
CAMPAIGN SF SHE

120
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:52,358
CAMPAIGN SHESHE

121
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:52,391
CAMPAIGN SHE WE

122
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:57,196
CAMPAIGN SHE WAS A WOMAN:

123
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:58,197
YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF

124
00:02:58,197 --> 00:02:59,698
STACK AGO DECK A LITTLE BIT.

125
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:00,866
DO YOU SEE A PROBLEM WITH

126
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:01,467
THAT ARRANGEMENT?

127
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:02,468
>> THAT'S INTERESTING.

128
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:03,435
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS IN

129
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:04,603
THE BOOK THAT I POINTS OUT

130
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:06,038
IS LIKE HILLARY ACTUALLY

131
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:07,873
LIKED THE GUYS.

132
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:09,675
LIKE YOUR VERY OWN ED HENRY

133
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:10,943
WOULD GRILL HER ABOUT OTHER

134
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:12,478
EMAILS AND SHE KIND OF

135
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:14,480
LIKED -- SHE LIKED THE

136
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,280
BANTER WITH HIM.

137
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,582
SHE WAS FLIRTY WITH SOME OF

138
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:17,149
THE GUYS.

139
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:19,284
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A

140
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:20,419
PARTICULAR LIKE LOVE FEST

141
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:21,420
BECAUSE WOMEN WERE COVERING

142
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,687
HER.

143
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:22,688
IF ANYTHING, I THINK THERE

144
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:23,655
WAS THE PERCEPTION THAT

145
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:24,690
WOMEN MIGHT BE TOUGHER ON

146
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,325
HER TO KIND OF PROVE, YOU

147
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:28,060
KNOW, THE COUNTER TO YOUR

148
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,360
POINT.

149
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,529
TO PROVE WE WEREN'T IN THE

150
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:30,896
TANK.

151
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:32,598
>> Tucker: IS SHE THE FIRST

152
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:33,532
SELF-DESCRIBED FEMINIST YOU

153
00:03:33,532 --> 00:03:36,268
HAVE EVER MET HARDER ON

154
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:39,671
>> I CANNOT ANSWER THAT

155
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:40,105
QUESTION.

156
00:03:40,105 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: I THINK WE BOTH
