all right Alicia this is this is quite the nasty topic here I mean the details in this article what Schneiderman allegedly did to his former girlfriends it's it's it's horrifying they have pictures to substantiate it everything from slapping spitting to calling his brown girlfriend a slave and making her call him master it's disgusting disgusting is the extremely appropriate word and I have to wonder how long have these allegations been out there there have been other Democrats even though the mainstream media didn't talk about there's a D after him his name and he was elected as a Democrat for this position how many other Democrats were aware of this because there have been other Democrats within the Cuomo administration in the great state of New York that have had these kind of issues and sexual assault allegations against them Cuomo came out very publicly today saying that he is not about this and he asked a New York prosecutor to go ahead and investigate which the New York City prosecutor said that they will indeed do the New York Police Department said that they hadn't heard anything but they would be willing to investigate and push through any charges you know that they could find if these women decided to go ahead and press legal charges as you said two of those women spoke on the record and I mean I've spoken on the record about far far far far less offenses that have happened to me in my professional life and even then I've gotten blowback I cannot imagine the blowback that these women are getting or the fear and and the level of investigation and kind of coercing it took from Ronan Farrow and the New Yorker team to get them to come forward and I say good for them for doing this and and the role-playing thing is just really disgusting it is beyond to just say oh we were fifty Shades in it no it is unbelievable Carole Markowitz over at the New York Post even wrote today she said do you know to show you how disgusting and how too powerful he really was and that where he thought he could get away with this is is that at one point when one of the women fought back he said you can't hurt me it's a felony of his position right he said - he told these women he's like these career women cuz a lot of these women were divorcing women who had high-powered careers they had children from their previous marriages and he said career women who are single with no kids liked to be dominated you'd be surprised at how many women like to be treated like that the fact that your mind could be so twisted to think that someone would enjoy abuse I mean III don't even know that there's vocabulary words to describe the Lev just how gross this is the protectionism - from the Democratic Party I mean my heart broke for these women who I echo your sentiment I kudos to them for coming out talking about this it's not easy my heart broke reading about the woman who said listen when I told my friends I was encouraged not to talk about it publicly because it is natural right this is such a vulnerable position that could go that could go Republican if Schneiderman were bumped out of this role I mean it's unbelievable it is unbelievable and you know what shame on kirsten gillibrand who of course is coming out today saying this is a shame and then he needs to step aside because when Meghan McCain very accurately asked her on the view okay if you're gonna be offended about these kind of levels of sexual harassment where were you with Bill Clinton you know how come you're all chummy with him the hypocrisy is rife and the fact that he got away with this for so long and he was at the forefront of the me2 movement specifically in the state of New York is an atrocity and I think that the Democratic Party of New York should apologize and they really need to call their ranks and listen I'm I'm the person that's like shoe on other foot as well the Republican Party needs to continue to remain and hopefully will continue to call out idiots then remain above reproach here I mean listen I I didn't want to lose the seat in Alabama to a Democrat but I'd rather have a Democrat in there then give the Liberals a talking point about you know a child molester that had an R after their name for the next five or ten elections right no III agree with you 100% here and III think - it's it's it's funny in the political sense that President Trump actually called this he tweeted I want to show on his on the screen here I think it was from 2013 he talked about Schneiderman and he said what Schneiderman did compared to Anthony Weiner or Eliot Spitzer is so much worse so much worse and and he's right I mean I I don't really know what could be worse than someone using their political power like Schneiderman did to abuse people and telling them that he is the law and they have no recourse if they don't tolerate and enjoy his abuse here Alicia and I I'd be remiss if I don't bring this up to the media bias around this story when it was breaking news last night the Washington Post Axios CNN NBC the LA Times Politico none of these publications which are probably the primary publications that we all see on our breaking News Alerts on our phone none of them mentioned Schneiderman's political party affiliation when they sent out this breaking news alert none of them oh how interesting yet in the headlines about the Iran deal or you know Oliver North being named president of the NRA there's always like the worst part of their history or their Republican or conservative political affiliations that are mentioned by all of those mainstream media outlets this isn't the first time that we've seen this happen when you had Jim McGreevey when you had other incidences of Democratic politicians doing these same things the D so interestingly disappears from all media coverage right because when it's a Democrat according to the left it's an anomaly when it's a Republican it's typical Planned Parenthood to got in on this action they actually attacked Kellyanne Conway for calling out Eric Schneiderman I mean of all the issues in our country Alicia I don't understand why this isn't something that both parties get on board with and condemn and get rid of you know just ostracize these people from our society but Planned Parenthood has to make this political they said delete your account Kellyanne Conway when she said gotcha about catching Eric Schneiderman I I don't understand this why would they be harsher to a woman who's pro-life and conservative than a man who brutally beats for women oh because he's for their agenda he's for abortion he even admitted on Twitter a few weeks ago and a tweet that did not age well that you know a woman's body should be the thing that she controls the most and that's why after college she went to work at an abortion clinic so you know I mean that's a whole other topic for another day but obviously he doesn't really value or care about the feminine life if that's something that he chose to do so quickly out of college and then later in his adult years this is how he abuses women it's disgusting it is it's absolutely disgusting I I still can't get over some of these details like I said kudos to these women they certainly I know we don't of these women don't hold the same political views that I do but I have their back solidly as I'm sure Alicia do you and a lot of other conservative women even though we don't agree a woman on earth deserves to be treated this way whether it's an attorney general with an R or a D after their name and no woman should be afraid of any man in power and it just goes to show you I think this is another argument for the smaller the government the more transparent the government the less that's kind of crap is going to happen
