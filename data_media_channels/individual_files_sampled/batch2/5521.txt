Cobb told me is he do the right thing do you read that as the White House will then provide all of this or or not he also mentioned to me that tonight was the first time he'd seen your letter I'm not convinced the White House is gonna give me anything without a fight and I'm well ready to fight that fight so in this new book Russian Roulette there's the inside story of Putin's war and America and they talk about the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow a trek to Russia the birth of the bromance or was it something worse that would soon up and American politics and they write quotes scandalized Trump's presidency the authors are here now let me start with you David the Miss Universe pageant is something that many point to as an origin story and yet your book recounts how Donald Trump nervously seemed to question whether Putin would even show up is that in some way exculpatory to Trump no it shows that Trump had a obsessive desire to meet with Putin he had been tweeting about him coming to Miss Universe can't the Miss Universe contest and once he got there he kept asking everyone around him will he meet with me will he come to the contest who I hear from him it shows that he had but two things an aspirational affinity for this strongman leader but also a real concern to forge a bond with him because he was committed to this lifelong desire of building a tower in Moscow that was the whole point of Miss Universe it was acceptance tone of working with a billionaire oligarch who was sponsoring the pageant to build a tower and those guys we can we forged a bond with then were the ones who helped him make connections his campaign with the Kremlin in 2016 so it's all connected the business ties to the campaign association with Kremlin cutouts Michael what would you say in your view is the most significant revelation you've unearthed for the book well there's actually quite a few but I think just picking up on what David's saying the relationships with the aguillera offs eros aguillera off the billionaire Oh Oleg arc who's known by the way his Putin's builder his son Ammon then that publicist Rob Goldstone go back to what's the most significant one of the most significant certainly developments in the Russia investigation the Trump Tower meeting right in the notorious Trump Tower meeting where they offer derogatory information on on Hillary Clinton to the highest officials of the in the Trump campaign that was set up hi eman Aguilera his father aris Aguilera and gold stone who sends those who sends the the fateful emails to to Donald Trump jr. right we were just looking at some of that footage I mean you're right your point being these words there's any guys these were these were guys who Trump had a relationship with Trump personally going back to actually before Moscow Las Vegas when he first meets them and then they go out partying at this raunchy Las Vegas nightclub you know there was before that famous Trump Tower meeting there was an initial Trump Tower meeting in January 2015 which we disclosed and our David for the first time David let me ask you does your book show that the Obama administration was not strong enough in responding to this in real time chapter 14 it's my favorite chapter in the book re because it goes into the August and September of 2016 when the Obama White House gets his top secret intelligence indicating that Russia is behind this the attack on the on the election and they have to consider what to do there are people in the NSC staff the National Security Council staff who want to have strong countermeasures cyberattacks on Putin and his cronies and Russian news sites Obama is worrying about disruptions to the election and we've just learned in the last day that the same time they had intelligence indicating the Russians were probing and perhaps in a position to threaten the electrical grid and nuclear power plants in the United States and Europe and in those high-level meetings in the White House in the sit room Director of National Intelligence James clapper says if we if we strike back with cyber we could get into we could escalate into a cyber war and they might be able to take down our grid so lots of dilemmas I would commend people to read that chapter and think you know you're not answering a question i don't all Minh David and then Michael yes or no should they have done more in real time what I believe they should have done has been more public and forceful in their statements okay and tell the public early on what was like owning yes and as we report in the book there were people on the White House staff who believed very strongly that if you don't strike back in real time you're going to you're sending a signal that they can get away with it Michael Daniel the White House of cybersecurity coordinator developed these really creative options for going after the Russians shutting down their new sites dumping information information about Putin's corruption and the secret bank accounts in Latvia Susan Rice's nationals the Obama's national security director calls him in and says stand down knock it off we don't want to box the president in that was a fateful move that basically you know sent a signal and that's what wanted a more forceful that's what I thought the book did in fascinating detail it showed a road to Trump Russia that is pretty damning for the current administration but it also perhaps with the benefit of hindsight showed a lot of problems with the prior administration given what we know now hey there I'm Chris
