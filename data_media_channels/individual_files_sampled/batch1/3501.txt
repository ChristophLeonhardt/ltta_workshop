if you are a member of the working or middle class in the United States your life has not improved in the last 40 years we have taken hundreds and hundreds of millions of people out of poverty around the world over the course of the past decades the rise of China has been extraordinary 1.4 billion people would never seen anything like it that growth has occurred on the back of open borders and free trade no question but you have lost a lot of opportunities in the West you have created much greater structural inequality and it's not just about the economy but economy is a big piece of it if you are a member of the working or middle class in the United States your life has not improved in the last 40 years you feel like the American Dream no longer applies to you while the Chinese feel like the Chinese dream that's something that they can be a part of that obviously undermines the notion of liberal democracy if the majority of Americans don't think they're capitalist because they don't have capital then they're not going to support a capitalist system and they're particularly not going to support it if they think that the capitalists on top aren't doing anything for them if their infrastructure isn't being invested into if their schools aren't being invested into if their policing isn't being invested into if their health care is worse than it used to be we're not responding to a massive opioid crisis then they're not going to support these governments and by the way we're saying this at a time when the US economy is growing at a strong clip we're saying this at a time when the IMF has just upgraded their expectations for global growth in 2018 and 2019 23.9% the best the world economy has done since before the financial crisis if that's the case now what's gonna happen in the next recession what's gonna happen suddenly when we don't have a huge tax plan that benefits everyone and we're spending like crazy and increasing the deficit well it's gonna happen something with times get tighter and when the corporation's aren't hitting the profitability that they are right now I mean clearly this is a situation that is going to get worse we elected Trump in the United States some people think was an illegitimate but there's no question he got the Republican nomination over 16 other candidates and Ted Cruz was probably number two Bernie Sanders was clearly enormous ly popular on the Democratic side like whoever won the US election we've not seen in an election like this with this kind of anti-establishment sentiment in certainly not as long as I've been alive and in Europe the vote for brexit in Germany the support for the alternatives for Deutschland party for the first time a nationalist party in the German parliament since World War two given their history that's extraordinary in Italy the five star movement the northen League winning from the far left and the far right this is obviously not an accident
