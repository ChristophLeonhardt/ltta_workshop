what do you think it will take for tech investors to regain the optimism that they had before all this uncertainty around privacy and Tesla and what's going on right now so I think first of all the upcoming earnings season it kicks off this month we'll see all of these big companies report earnings and many not all of them will probably report very very strong earnings and if it's not earnings than at least its growth that is revenues the likes of Amazon with it in that latter category there are of course some that face a specific company related risks so Facebook obviously around data privacy and data protection an Tesla around some of the issues with autonomous driving and several other issues they're specific to that company so that tide may not lift all the boats as it were but I do think most of them will end up surprising now lowered earnings expectations for the first quarter and that's going to help stabilize their share prices and what do you think that look is for Amazon now that Trump has come off and tried is attacking them well I think for Amazon it probably doesn't really change much about that business model it is a model that is based on capturing market share and the largest and most important market in the world which is the consumers wallet they're well on their way to being able to do that they are paying state taxes it's not really an issue that that revolves around taxation and there's actually very little the federal government and in particular that the White House can do about those aspects of it so my sense this is that this is a sort of a sound and fury that will probably abate and be replaced by some other issue going forward and that although amazon will obviously have to be cognizant of events in washington has to obviously watch it steps there and certainly has to watch it at some point in the future around antitrust types of activity in general I think its business model looks intact you
