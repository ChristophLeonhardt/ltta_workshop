“Thousands of civilians
have fled parts of
Syria’s Daraa Province,
where the government
has stepped up its offensive.”
“Russian and regime forces
target hospitals
cynically and deliberately.”
“The country’s entire health
system has collapsed.”
“Some of those fleeing the
violence have nowhere to go,
and the Jordan-Syria
border remains closed.”
“Oh, oh, no, no no.”
“I’m sorry.
I’m sorry.”
“So Dr. Mohammed, do you
see the colon up here?
It’s plastered
onto the bowel.”
“No, this is bad —
this is a lot of
inflammation.”
“Hmm.”
“It’s really not
looking good at all.”
