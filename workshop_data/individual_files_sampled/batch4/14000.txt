the New York Times a former newspaper is reporting that a feud is broken out between President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell the story broke after anonymous sources within the Times told reporters within the times that editors within the Times would like stories about the Trump McConnell feud from anonymous sources within the Times according to these sources the feud began shortly after McConnell failed to secure a majority Republican vote for repealing Obamacare a furious President Trump responded by calling McConnell a turtle face new new head whereupon the disgruntled Senate Majority Leader struck back by writing Melania Trump's phone number on the wall of the Senate men's room incensed by the insult the President of the United States snuck up behind McConnell in the Capitol rotunda and harshly pulled the Kentucky Democrats Underpants up into his butt crack then quickly ran away while all the other senators laughed including the pretty girl senator who McConnell had been hoping to ask to the prom according to sources McConnell planned his revenge in secret for weeks and ultimately managed to rig a chain around the rear axle of limousine 1 so that when the presidential motorcade was heading out for a shake and a burger at Big Al's drive in the back tires of trumps car there suddenly yanked clean off it's a prank that will likely be remembered in the Senate until they're all voted out of offices they deserve a furious president responded by storming into the Senate and challenging McConnell to either meet him face to face in the Rose Garden or admit he's a yellow coward whereupon according to several witnesses McConnell's lower lip trembled and he had to turn away to keep the other guys from seeing that his eyes had filled up with tears according to sources the frighten McConnell considered running away from home until the kindly coach of the Senate Jim sat him down and gave him some wise advice about how sometimes a man has got to stand up and fight even though he's afraid inspired by this heart-to-heart the Majority Leader kept his appointment with the president in the Rose Garden and the two men started punching each other and ultimately rolled off behind a rosebush above which witnesses said they could only see a roiling cup of dust and several objects flying into the air including a red tie a pair of spectacles and some dentures CNN blame the president for the feud and said he was exhibiting childish behavior that ignored the good of the country at the president's next press conference CNN's Jim Acosta raised his hand and said quote look at me I'm Jim Acosta I can wiggle my ears and make rude noises with my armpits look at me look at me right now unquote a cost of them pulled down his pants and shook his naked backside at the president and ran away with an angry Trump laughter it's pretty much business as usual in Washington I'm Andrew Cleveland and this is the Andrew Clavin show we should bring back the little thing the ticker that yet sells how many days I've made it through without laughing oh boy the Clavin this weekend is here already I know it really zipped by there's a lot happening this week luckily luckily Michael Knowles and I are working around the clock on a cure for the Clavin this weekend we have our own podcast that we're doing in our spare time it's my new fantasy thriller I don't know what to call it I've kind of experimenting with a new genre thriller fantasy novel that Knowles is going to perform as a podcast we're gonna like let unleash this story soon and probably in September today we have dr. dr.

conference with the press now the press is lying to cover up the fact that they were destroyed right story I love the presses you know we've gotten so crazy did you hear the story about ESPN did you hear this Robert Lee I know that he's an asian-american and sports announcer named Robert Lee and he was going to announce the UVA game the University of Virginia game Charlottesville and so they took him off because his name was the same as the veteran general but they issued a clarification today they actually did issue a clarification saying the problem is that he actually is the confederate general he has been hiding out as a statue all this time and then came back to life as an Asian man to bring back the Confederacy with all Asians this time so it's really it was a master plot so luckily yes PA anyway so so yesterday right they I mean the day before yesterday Trump makes this incredible speech lashes out at the press just hammers them and the press falls apart they absolutely fall apart meanwhile the left is rioting in the streets after all this time of being told that no no no there's not violence on both sides the left is rioting in the streets here's CBS's report the next morning listen to who's to blame and by the way there were very very few Trump supporters out there it was just a protest let's let's listen to CBS good morning this is where thousands of protestors and Trump supporters were gathered before the rally they were very vocal but largely peaceful all of that changed however after the president spoke and a small group of protesters ignored police orders to lead a small group after he spoke it was only after he spoke it was like those words those evil words went out there they were throwing the words were throwing things that the police was terrible as a terrible scene Don Lemon who just made a complete ass of himself I mean if if he needed to do that he just went out and lied about what he said all day long the next day yesterday all day long he's saying like we didn't say Trump was crazy we didn't attack his men to listen to him listen to this he blows it off when people criticize and say oh well they're questioning the president's sanity and all of that they know better they're doing it just you know just because to make a political point of some sort yeah what could they have possibly seen play with Don Lemon said that day this is six he's unhinged it's embarrassing and I don't mean for us the media because he went after us but for the country this is who we elected president of the United States a man who is so pitted petty that he has to go after people who he deems to be his enemy like an imaginary friend of a six-year-old his speech was without thought it was without reason it was devoid of facts it was devoid of wisdom there was no gravitas there was no sanity there he was like a child blaming a sibling on something else he did it I didn't do it he certainly opened up the race wound from Charlotte's ville a man clearly wounded by the rational people who are abandoning him in droves meaning those business people and the people in Washington now who are questioning his fitness for office and whether he is stable but other than that he was completely objective and I also love the way the press just hammers this guy hammers hammers hammers I'm 90 something like 90 percent of their stories are negative and then how petty is he to strike back you know it you talk about says talk about it's like your it's like your kids sister like you know setting your toys on fire and then when you go after is like you see he's coming after me I'm just I'm just a girl you know the important ly after you get a terrific shave with that crazy razor you can then go out and eat we are clean shaven Omaha Steaks which aren't we you haven't been here my son is here Spencer you're going on Michael Moses show you poor guy I'm sorry and I don't know what I did well I think that the you know to

vistas I think he's getting no credit for you know he really is going after the VA you know the VA is terrible scandals that the VA these veterans who can't get their benefits and they're getting terrible health care I mean essentially what we're doing is we're condemning veterans to Obamacare were condemning veterans to government health care but he is making it possible to fire people so important and he's got this new veterans appeals improvement and Modernization Act which streamlines the process of veterans appealing claims over disability benefits so he goes out and he took a slightly different tone attend his Phoenix speech here's Trump it is time to heal the wounds that divide us and to seek a new unity based on the common values that unite us we are one people with one home and one great flag okay he went a little off script there after he had it for a minute there we had teleprompter Trump and then yeah I was just Godzilla destroyed but you know the thing that always gets me about Trump is like no matter what he does in there times when I love him at times when I hate him you know is all kind you know he's just that guy he's just this a huge personality huge flaws some really good things that he's done but but no matter what he does I look at the other side and they're just so bad I mean Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton has her new book coming out called what happened I mean that's that's what it says but you have to read you have to read in the right tone of voices and she's reading this thing about Trump standing in back of her which you know I was looking at different videos this must-have I soon this really happened because Hillary wouldn't lie would she come on you know I mean but every time I see him he its first in in front of him but he's behind his lectern he's exactly where he's supposed to be but this is her recounting how he stood in back of her during one of the debates this is not okay I thought it was the second presidential debate and Donald Trump was looming behind me two days before the world heard him brag about groping women now we were on a small stage and no matter where I walked he followed me closely staring at me making faces it was incredibly uncomfortable he was literally breathing down my neck my skin crawled it was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching well what would you do do you stay calm keep smiling and carry on as if he weren't repeatedly invading your space or do you turn look him in the eye and say loudly and clearly back up you creep get away from me I know you love to intimidate women but you can't intimidate me so back up I did not have sexual relations with that woman miss Lewinsky I never told anybody to lie not a single time never but she's right he is creepy oh wait that's not the same guy though I mean this is this is the thing that really gets me you know President Obama remained personally popular throughout his eight years who remained it personally popular president but everybody who supported and was voted out of office because he was a bad president he was bad at being president but he came across as a nice guy and I think he did terrible things but he was a nice guy but now you're acting like where is where is Trump who is not a nice guy doesn't come across you know comes across as a loose cannon he's actually done some really good things so far already and hopefully will do more when the Senate and Congress comes back to it you know was he sitting again but their their idolatry could we do we have the knucklehead Roshan we have to take a trip to knuckle head row at the New York Times knucklehead row the op-ed page of the new verse they have a piece today unbelievable it's by a woman named Carolyn Randall Williams who I think was a cookbook author she's this young lady and she writes this thing come back Obama and tell her explain to us what's going on she says President Obama now is the time to start talking I appreciate your instinct to hold back to follow the keep quiet about the new guy tradition of former presidents but these are not traditional times they're unprecedented and frankly unpresidential you deserve a break but we're out here in this hand best basket mr. Obama this mr. Obama you are the president who got up and sang Amazing Grace after the Charleston South Carolina killings you are the president who shed tears in public after Sandy Hook now we are a country troubled by the looming possibility of a constitutional crisis and hate groups are claiming the president as theirs we need your voice where are you Obama there is not a saner more trustworthy opinion that many of us would rather hear I'm not sure that's grammatical but anyway you know it's like that that is the left all over he sang Amazing Grace after the Charleston killings and he shed tears so he must have been a good president and this guy's such a blustering bumbling guy but you know it's like it's not like mr. Obama you corrupted the IRS you've set the Middle East on fire you withdrew from Iraq too soon you you gave Iran a nuclear weapon come back and tell us and she ends it she says my generation graduated from college and got our first job and became adults all while you were president we learned to experience politics through the lens of your eloquent presence in the White House in this respect you raised us so we are unaccustomed to all of this wildness just because we're grown-up doesn't mean we don't need to hear from the man who brought us up like this is the world we're living in like an Asian American broadcaster named Robert Lee is a erected Confederate General and Obama was a good president because he knew how to cry on camera and he did know how to cry on cue I have to I have to give him credit where credit is due he could you know it's all about like illusion for them it is all that because they live in the world of the media the media creates their world and we because we're on the other side of the media always have to question what the media is saying and it gets it brings you closer to reality speaking of which reality for me is a constant search for everything I own is a constant search for things I lost now for some of you if you guys are like me you might want to get tracker track or it's just the word track and are which they have they have a new one they invented this they really did have battle eight years ago they are the first you know private tracking device but now they have the track or pixel now I have a wife so I you know I don't have to do that I just keep saying where did I leave my keys where do I leave my phone where do I leave them and then when I regain consciousness then I go to my track are I actually do have it it's on my keys but the thing is I lose my keys sometimes but what Irene's might fall we're gonna try this on this is Darren if it doesn't work if it doesn't work it's because I'm an incompetent don't blame it but but the thing the thing is so cool about this is if you lose your keys you can find them with your phone but what happens if you lose your phone cuz that's what I do all the time and the thing is you press this before the show so it won't ring you know and like is but even if it shut off this tracker helps you find it it is so so cool it's the lightest bluetooth tracking device on the market you can put it on whatever you tend to lose keys wallets even your cat it's small enough to fit any good hair lecture I want to get that close to my cat when you misplace an item that has a tracker pixel attached you use your smartphone and a 90 decibel alert will help you find it in seconds it even has powerful LED lights so you can find anything even in the dark it's pretty it's pretty amazing stuff locate your item even if it's miles away cuz it's like you know that thing weighs where the everybody tells you what the traffic is ahead of you it's like that you can have a community of people having helping you find it and it's got a 30-day money-back guarantee so you truly have nothing to lose you've got you want to go to the tracker calm now I made a mistake last time I've left up the V because they don't run it together so it's V track RT R ACK are.com and then enter promo code kleavon k la vie it should be for tracker should be k la vie n but as fast as que la be a n and if you spell it right you get 20% off any order that's the tracker dot-com V tracker comm the tracker comm promo code Clavin 420 cent percent off the tracker dot-com promo code Clavin do we do we have dr. Piper oh great art bring him on let's start man dr. Piper I'm glad you're here dr. pipe dr. everett piper is the president of oklahoma Wesleyan University and the author of why I am a liberal and other conservative ideas his new book which I was reading over the last couple of days is not a daycare the devastating consequences of abandoning truth dr. Piper it's good of you to come on I appreciate it this is a fascinating book and I think the best way to introduce people to this book is for you to tell the story of how you read it because I read that story with my mouth hanging open about Corinthians it's an amazing tale well first of all thank you for having me on clave and I'm honored and briefly it was about two years ago at Oklahoma Wesleyan University where I serve as president that we have required Chapel on Wednesday and Friday just before Thanksgiving and the sermon for that particular day was on first Corinthians 13 for those who don't remember it's the quintessential love chapter of the Bible you've heard it read at a thousand weddings love his patient love is kind well we actually had a student at my conservative Christian liberal arts institution that came forward and it confronted the speaker after this particular homily and he said you offended me you singled me out you made me feel uncomfortable you victimized me so I'm serious from the lowest kind what was it what was this problem losses problems well apparent apparently he felt guilty he felt that we were wrong for making him feel guilty for not being loving enough so I had a response I challenged the young man and I said you know that feeling you had of discomfort during that sermon on love it's called your conscience and then I suggested you know at Oklahoma Wesleyan University as any good university should we're going to challenge you when we're gonna confront you we're not gonna coddle you and we're not gonna comfort you we actually expect you to grow up and become a man of character rather than sit around and be selfish and self-absorbed and narcissistic in your sin so if you feel guilty during a sermon or an altar call good confess what's wrong with you that rather than blaming everybody else is what I'm with about what's wrong with them and I concluded by saying my land this is a university it's not a daycare and that led to this book in this interview because the thing went viral I mean everybody was passing it around because it was you know because everybody's so tired of these they call them snowflakes but there's one you know you tell so many stories about them but we've all heard the stories no so what what is what is this coming from I mean this was not this was starting when I was a school which is a long time ago but has gotten to be you know he's gotten to be like a plague what is what is causing this I would argue it's my industry it's education we've created this monster and it's turning around to bite us for decades we've been teaching lousy ideas we've been teaching self absorption and self actualization and narcissism we've been teaching kids that it doesn't matter what you believe as long as it works for you you know Richard Weaver wrote a seminal work in 1948 and he titled it ideas have consequences and what was his point ideas have consequences ideas matter they always lead somewhere and if you teach bad ideas you get bad culture bad kids bad government bad corporations and bad community if you teach good ideas the big ideas the first things you get good culture good kids in a good community like your grandmother said garbage in and garbage out the chickens are coming home to roost we've been teaching terrible ideas for decades and now we're seeing terrible behavior in our campuses and in our campus cream there's no getting away from the fact that when you talk about these bad ideas these are leftist ideas I mean these are not the ideas that I hear on campus is none of them you know is from the right that's all from the left and the it's kind of a narrative on the right that the left made this March through our institutions that they very purposely took over the Academy took over Hollywood took over the news business did do you feel that this was an intentional assault on the Academy do you feel the left as a movement did this on purpose M Scott Peck called it the diabolical human mind I have a friend dr. Graham Walker calls it the pathology of the intellect in the guy in the Epistle to the Romans the Apostle Paul calls it the reprobate mind these are all references basically to this the smarter you are the more arrogant you become and you drink your own kool-aid and you believe your own lies so yes the Academy has is at fault was it intentional you could argue whether it is or isn't but the fact of the matter is we've been teaching these ideas these terrible ideas for decades and now we're suffering the consequences for it what you see today is ideological fascism rather than intellectual freedom a fascist was a Roman bundle of sticks bound together so tightly that it couldn't be broken it's out of that we get the word fascism and today if you don't comply if you don't submit if you're not one of us if you don't think like we think and believe like we believe we're gonna crush you we're gonna suppress you we're gonna sequester you we're gonna expel you you're verboten and you're unwelcome it's the opposite of intellectual Liberty classical liberalism its ideological fascism well we're talking about this book by dr. Everett Piper not a daycare the devastating consequences of abandoning truth now the book what Oklahoma Wesleyan University is a Christian school and right you talked a lot about Christ and teaching Christianity and and I've argued for a long time that we need a revival at the intellectual top rather than a tent revival we need one in our academies and our with our intelligence II which I actually believe is happening even as you and I are sitting here talking about it but but not every school is a Christian school and you know there are schools that are great schools Harvard Yale Princeton these are terrific schools or they used to be that would in some sense wouldn't they be betraying they're betraying their brief to be teaching Christianity as if it were the truth I mean is is that a problem actually no let me explain why in my view and this is the beauty of the Liberal Arts Academy you and I could debate that Harvard and I could debate that but Harvard in Dartmouth and Princeton and Yale and all of the Ivy League institutions with the exception of one were founded explicitly in a judeo-christian ethic Harvard for example had its original mission statement that said let to lay Christ at the bottom is the foundation of all learning so I'll use your word revival revival implies that you can revive return reform go back go back to what to a true north to Veritas Latin for truth which is still on Oxford shield some 1,000 years after it was founded so my question would be this do you believe what GK Chesterton said when he said you have no freedom without fences freedom does not suppose our presuppose our free-for-all freedom cannot be had without boundaries you can't play soccer if you don't understand the rules if there isn't a referee to blow the whistle if it all digresses to power and privilege you can't play the game so what would you rather have the French Revolution and the guillotine or the American Revolution and self-evident truths that are endowed to us by our Creator I think the proofs in the pudding as to which modeling paradigm gives you more intellectual and personal freedom well I certainly agree with that the last part of what you just said and the proof is in the pudding but the thinkers that led up to the French Revolution the Enlightenment thinkers some of the thinkers who came after who were anti religion you know thinkers like Nietzsche and and people like you know who basically opposed the entire idea of God would you not teach them oh no I would teach them robustly I want my students to understand each have better than anybody else I want my students to understand the debate to engage in it to have a robust argument to exchange ideas it's the beauty of conservative education as we conserve the time-tested truths that are endowed to us by our Creator it's the beauty of classical liberal education because you believe in liberty and liberation and freedom and justice and the truth like Christ said the truth shall set you free not your power or my privilege not your person not your pulpit now your podium not your priest not your pastor not the pedagogue not the politician truth will judge the debate and it's only within the context of those fences to go back to Chesterton that we can truly engage and what the Academy was established to do and that's pursue liberty and liberation that's grounded in a standard bigger and better than you and me let me let me challenge this to put forward a challenge it may not be what I would say personally but I know it's it is what people would argue on the other side we believe both both you and I believe that certain parts of the truth are just revealed to us they're not there are axioms they're things that as you say your self evident and as Jefferson said are self-evident but there are many people who simply do not accept the Bible as the truth these people going to be excluded are they is the other side of too much tolerance intolerance are the people who will not don't want to live a biblical life don't want to live according to what they see as basically the Fiat of of religion are those people to be excluded from education absolutely not in fact I would argue that somebody that disagrees with everything I've said on your program today would have more freedom on my campus than they would at Berkeley for example you can come to Bartlesville Oklahoma and engage in this discussion with me with with much greater liberty liberation of freedom to disagree with me at my campus then you would have it Berkley the proof is there Milo for example who might disagree with on a lot of things would enjoy more intellectual freedom here that does not presuppose or assume that I'll agree with them and in fact maybe we may disagree robustly but we can have that debate we can have that disagreement we can exchange ideas in a civil and tolerant fashion without saying I can't tolerate your intolerance and I hate you label people and I'm sure that nothing is sure and cut off the very branch upon which we set we actually believe there's an answer at the end of the day and the belief in that answer gives us the freedom to pursue it alright a couple more more practical questions one of the things that always puzzles me is why parents of basically conservative bent send their kids to these schools and I mean you know people shell out a lot of money for the school as I well know and you save up your whole life to be able to do it and sometimes these kids go into debt why do the parents keep doing it and how can you get them to stop they're crazy but stop your question is the perfect summary to this interview what in the world are you doing you'd spend 18 years of your life training up your child in the way he should go so that when he is old he will not depart him in the first 18 minutes as you drive away from your campus of choice they're taking pride in tearing his heart mind and soul out why would you do that why would you pay for that parents need to start paying - excuse me start voting with their pocketbook and their feet they need to stop singing they're in their kids off to these institutions that teach this pablum and send them to a school that actually believes that there's a right and wrong answer at the end of the day I'll close with this I don't give you in a degree in opinions at Oklahoma Wesleyan University I don't say you majored in an opinion I actually hope you learned something opinions lead to bondage and slavery Pol Pot had an opinion Mao had an opinion ropes Pierre had an opinion and it did not end well Christ said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free which paradigm do you want for your kid which one will lead to a freer culture and sphere Society well I think a lot of people are gonna feel I think you are the you know fighting against the tide but that doesn't mean you can't win not a day care the devastating consequences of abandoning truth by dr. Everett Piper dr. Piper thank you for coming on I appreciate it very honored thank you for having me thanks a lot you know I have to say I wrote it was right after Obama won again I wrote a piece that's still up on city journal as you can find it called the long game in which I said you know the Conservatives typically neglect the culture and the among the things that we have to do is we really have to start arguing for a revival at the intellectual top I mean this is this is the thing the the idea of relativism has played itself out it makes no sense the idea of multiculturalism was to screw on September 11th you know these things have fallen apart and we can make the argument but it's a tough argument to make because I think religion is obviously religion in the modern world is gonna look different than medieval religion you know the medieval people didn't know as much as we know we were talking Spencer I were talking before about CS Lewis's idea that the in the Middle Ages they saw the sky as the dome of a cathedral whereas we see it as infinite meaningless space but you can't stop seeing it as infinite space it is infinite space you can't stop seeing it you can't continue to believe that the sky is a dome once you've sent a rocket up through it so we're gonna have to make sure that our religion addresses a scientific world instead of you know closing our eyes to the things that science has taught us you know if you don't think this is a big deal I mean there's so much stuff going on on the left right now I think it's the thing that really gets me if Donald Trump is so evil if Donald Trump is so evil why is it only the left trying to silence people why is it only the left that assaults the Bill of Rights if Donald Trump is such an evil guy when was the last time Donald Trump did anything to get in the way of the practice of our religion after the free expression of our religion like Obama did when he sued the Little Sisters of the Poor of the I mean how much of a villain do you have to eat have to internal your mustache to go after the Little Sisters of the Poor to force them to pay for contribution I mean it's like when he did that I was like I thought gee if there were any media at all if we had any honest media they would be looking at the president United States saying you are using the power of the government to go after the Little Sisters of the Poor is I know mr. president don't make us paper yes you will pay for contraception Little Sisters of the boy really you will be or I'll tie you to the railroad track but I mean he got away with it cuz the press wouldn't do it if Donald Trump is so evil why are the only people who want to get rid of the right to free speech on the Left why is that I don't I do not understand it you know there was a review of a book interestingly enough there's a review of a book in The Wall Street Journal today called ijen why today's soup connected kids are growing up less rebellious more tolerant less happy and completely unprepared for adulthood and the interesting thing about it is it's by this woman gene twinge and I read that and I thought gee didn't we just talk about her on the show and in fact she had written an op-ed and this happens a lot because you want to promote your book you write an op-ed to sort of go along with it but she was writing about the fact that suicide is now the second cause of death among young adults which is a stunning stunning observational stunning fact a stunning stat and she writes this book this where she says tolerance is their religion this is the review of the book church-going and faith are in free fall among I generous so i Jenner's are like the next generation up their views on LGBTQ matters are more liberal than those of any previous generation so to their views of sex they're having less sex themselves but are less judgmental about the sexual habits of others which is really interesting because it's a failure to preach what you practice it means that you know that you should have a little self-control you know the promiscuity is bad but you don't to tell anybody you know you don't want to tell me you know let's keep it keep it to yourself and let them get syphilis to support they don't want to but but there's something that they are not tolerant about and that was what dr. Piper was saying it's deemed if it's an offense against tolerance itself because tolerance is their religion so members of ijen mist winds say are more likely than their predecessors to support restricting speech she found that more than one out of four students 28% agreed that a faculty member who on a single occasion says something racially insensitive in class should be fired while 16% believe a student who did the same thing once should be expelled in a rare moment of judgmentalism miss twinge adds this is the dark side of tolerance it begins with the good intentions of including everyone and not offending anyone but ends at best with a reluctance to explore deep issues and at worse with careers destroyed by a comment someone found offensive and the silencing of all alternative viewpoints I mean this is the problem this is the problem you can talk about Donald Trump's manners which are terrible you can talk about his bullying is the thing I find most offensive about you can talk about his personality being unbridled and you know uncontrolled and all the stuff but why is it if he is so evil why is it that the dear father Obama who we missed so much because he cried that his side of the only people violating openly trying to destroy the Bill of Rights yeah I don't understand that I do not understand why good manners Trump's actual destruction of our values and our the laws that have protected us for so long all right stuff I like and then we will leave you to the Clavin this weekend I'm afraid you know we you know we haven't talked about yet though I didn't say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube where they on us with us the whole time great good for you but you know what you know what we let you stay on but that means that's another reason why you should subscribe it's only a lousy 10 bucks a month what are you waiting for 10 bucks a month and you get to be on the mailbag if you yeah you can just subscribe for the month and be in the mailbag and we'll answer all your questions save your life change your life it'll be an amazing experience but if you subscribe for the year it's just a hundred bucks $99.99 and keep the penny and don't spend it all in one place plus the liberal tears mug it's double just tumblr the liberal tears tumblr is made of Valyrian small Aryan steel it cures baldness in some it's like it keeps your liberal tears warm or cold however you prefer them and it automatically refills every time Donald Trump makes a speech so this is it's an amazing thing it's and it doesn't have Stephen Crowder's name on I think Crowder's coming on next week yeah yeah all right I love Steve it's he's laughing we're gonna let him out of his padded cell and bring him over stuff I like I am NOT and have never been a Saturday Night Live fan I think it is a self-indulgent mostly unfunny show I think every six weeks they do something kind of amusing but there is one routine they did it's not that long ago called black jeopardy and they they had one thing with Tom I want to say Tom Hanks thanks I say Tom Cruise was Tom Hanks who was fantastic in it and the concept of black shepherd is obviously is black people playing jeopardy and they have these kind of weird you know categories like mm I don't know will be the category and the answer is what is I don't know what and so they have all the but one of the contestants turns out to be a trump supporting white guy with a beard played by Hanks and they so they start going down the line asking questions and here's just a bit of it it's so brilliant because basically it destroys identity politics right it's like it says it says there's no difference in the races it's all culture their culture is essentially the same it is a brilliant brilliant piece of satire with that we're going to leave you flying blind into the Cleveland this weekend I hate to do it at this point well we've got last week Ed's of violence people getting fired it's awful it's awful but but if you survive we will be here again on Monday and we will explain the devastation to you I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show and we'll see you then
