00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,370
I've learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many lessons launching</font>

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,350
Skinnygirl which is why I wrote a book

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,910
called I suck at relationships so you

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,740
don't have to because in my business

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,840
life I've learned way more from my

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,299
mistakes to ultimately achieve success

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,570
so I've made so many mistakes I have

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,880
checked off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong box in a way to be</font>

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,939
paid and I think I checked I had to be

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,420
an S corp vs an LLC or vice versa and it

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,340
ended up costing me millions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars</font>

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that you do that are just a</font>

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,000
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> checking off of a box can later</font>

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,640
really really burn you it's a lot of

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's about when I back when I didn't</font>

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,520
have any money and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I couldn't really</font>

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,920
afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the legal that I should</font>

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been able to afford so you better</font>

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,920
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your own contracts but</font>

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,530
by the same token I've made a lot of

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,930
great decisions I decided season<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font>

22
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,820
housewife when I got paid seven thousand

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,079
two hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and fifty dollars for the</font>

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,600
entire season my only thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted my</font>

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,610
contract was that everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did in my</font>

26
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,340
work was mine I was like Tina Turner I

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,260
own everything I just want my name and

28
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,180
when I ended up selling the small

29
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,430
portion of skinny girl that is cocktails

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,650
that ended up<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very good decision</font>

31
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,420
and they created the Bethenny clause

32
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,600
which is what all agents make their

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,520
clients sign because anyone who signs on

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,110
to reality television has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give a</font>

35
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,960
portion of their business<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the man</font>

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,909
except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was grandfathered in</font>

37
00:01:20,909 --> 00:00:00,000
because i am the bethany clause
