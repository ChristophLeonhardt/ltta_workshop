some new and very troubling information about Sean Hannity being outed as one of Michael Cohen's clients now I was a bit tough on Sean Hannity saying he should have disclosed that he had any type of legal conversation with Michael Cohen look I don't think he was required to do it I just think it's a matter of good policy when you're on air to do it I always disclose my relationships with people I have well relationships with outside the show that you linger who's running for congress I use him as an expert because he was a naval commander in CIA station chief but I am supporting and helping him with his congressional race in Pennsylvania and it's important for you to know that that you can trust me and know that I'm coming to you ethically when I bring Scott or other people with whom I engage off the show to you as experts you should know that I have an outside relationship with them it doesn't matter it's not gonna change how I interview them but it's just the right thing to do but I think Hannity probably knowing the magnitude of this situation and knowing that the mainstream media the left the Democrats were gonna seize on the tiniest tiniest thing to hammer him probably should have disclosed that I've been over that but there's a new and very troubling piece of information now when the judge wanted to know who the clients were the judge could have taken Hannah DS name under seal and the judge was willing to do that was willing to do that we're finding out now though is that CNN and the New York Times attorney a media lawyer immediately who represents among others the CNN and the New York Times was his name is is uh his Rob Balin of the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine this from a conservative review story and after judge Kimba wood was willing to accept Hannity's name under seal that had know the name the third clients name this attorney Rob Balin got up and successfully argued that the name should be disclosed in a public court setting now judge would probably should have sealed the whole proceeding I'll explain why a little bit later but she didn't she instead opted to have a public hearing on the matter in her courtroom which was her a righteous it's within her authority as judge but she outed she allowed this lawyer to successfully or else she didn't allow she felt this lawyer successfully argued an ADIZ name it went public it was reported then by the New York Times in CNN without disclosure they were supremely unethical in all this now Hannity maybe should have said he and Cohen discussed legal matters to cover his own but to ensure that he left the mainstream media the Democrats nowhere to go but for the New York Times in CNN and they got Hannity's name out in seconds and you remember when I reported on this I said well I wonder how the New York Times and CNN found out about it that quickly well their lawyer went in to argue there was a heads-up they were embedded in the court now we know it would have been embedded in the courtroom anyway but the deck was already stacked this is really bad and neither in the New York Times CNN or any other media outlet represented by this lawyer who benefited from that disclosure disclosed in their reporting that it was in fact their attorney who argued who publicly revealed Hannity's name it wasn't the judges own doing or the prosecutors who argued for it the prosecutors were fine with the name being given to the court under seal and the reason the name would be given is still a matter of legal question now many legal experts Mark Levin Andrew McCarthy over at National Review and many others feel the name never should have been disclosed but this highlights a bigger issue the media is now sending attorneys in to do the bidding of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats because I don't believe for a single millisecond that if it was one of Hillary Clinton's attorneys at the hearing who was the subject of a raid that the New York Times and The Washington Post would have ever said to Lauren they would have never sent a lawyer in to argue for the disclosed publicly disclosed names of others represented by this attorney because they knew that those names are gonna be people close to Hillary Clinton because in this case you know that CNN in the New York Times and their attorneys knew that the names disclosed were going to be people close the president Trump now Angie McCarthy and National Review wrote a scathing piece where he essentially excoriates the judge CNN the New York Times the prosecutors for going about it this way and when you read McCarthy's piece a former skilled highly skilled federal prosecutor you can't help you can't help but reinforce the belief for me anyway that this investigation is unethical biased and designed only to embarrass and subsequently impeach Donald Trump and I'm gonna be telling you all about McCarthy's article reading you excerpts from it on my longer show off-the-cuff Declassified today right here on the rebel
