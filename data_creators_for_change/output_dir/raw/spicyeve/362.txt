5
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,090

6
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,390
cuz i'm reading Dante 86 what oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

7
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,010

12
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,290
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> places that</font>

13
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,549
aren't directly north south east or west

14
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,390
any deviation from that is really

15
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,479
dangerous in terms of writing public

16
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,400
transportation so um thankfully he is
