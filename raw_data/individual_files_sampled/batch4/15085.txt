you I'm answer levan it's May 30th and you're watching battleground hello my friends and maybe a few enemies to welcome to battleground every day at 12:00 noon Eastern Time 5 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time 10 a.m. Alberta time 9:00 a.m. British Columbia time we talk for one hour live unscripted we have some video clips sometimes some news websites to show you but the primary aspect of these noontime chats are just that chat in fact google has something called super chat that they've invented as you can see on the right hand side of the screen hundreds of comments are being made by people I try to read as many of those as I can but if you want your comment to become a super chat comment for a couple of bucks a couple of pounds whatever currency you're in you can chip that in and your comment is put in bright highlighted colors and with a certain amount it's appended to the top of the screen by the way the rebel gets that dough so it helps us pay the bills over here it's fun it's live fun maybe it's not the word for the shows this week in past weeks we've talked about rather silly things in the media things that maybe aren't serious enough to merit coverage in my 8 p.m. show which is behind a paywall so we do lighter stuff it's almost like chatting about tweets or something but this week it has been heavy indeed we've been talking about the case of our former employee Tommy Robinson he left us a few months ago to go independent and then on Friday morning as all of you know he was whisked off the street by 7 police and within minutes well actually from being whisked off the street to sent to prison it was a matter of hours but he was taken to court not given access to his regular lawyer given a duty lawyer a public defender who did not know him did not over the know the law of contempt of court Tommy as we have now learned pled guilty it was a was bulldozed into it from what I can detect I'm certain of it and I'll make the case for that and he was sent off to Her Majesty's Prison Hull for 13 months what I'm gonna do today for those of you who haven't seen it I'm gonna play the video of his arrest just once I've shown that earlier this week but there may be some people who haven't seen it yet and it's important you know this one fact before tommy was arrested he had been live-streaming his commentary in front of the courthouse for more than an hour I know that because I was watching it I was curious I mean I still keep in touch with Tommy by watching his videos and we've chatted a little bit since he left us so I actually saw what he was doing before the police arrested him and he did was not causing a disturbance he was not revealing any confidences about the trial he was not on court property I just want to play you very briefly the clip of his arrest and I will not play that video again because I'm sure most people have seen it and I want to tell you what I have learned in the last 24 hours I want to put to you two reasons that I think Tommy's sentence should be set aside he should be granted bail the matter should be rescheduled for a more formal hearing with proper lawyers and I want to close today's show and I'm gonna try and do this all in the next 56 minutes I got a close today show by giving you a sample of my studies over the last day I've been going through contempt of court rulings from the UK I literally started with this month and I've been working my way back reading I've read a dozen contempt of court cases I'm reading more I want to give you one example to show you how disproportionate Tommy sentences in contrast with some others now I haven't done a full study of it I've only been poking around for a day but you can do it too and in fact I'll put the website that I am studying from in the comment section so you can do homemade poking around yourself I always recommend against being a homemade lawyer but you can read these decisions and see with your own eyes how rare it is to have a severe sentence like Tommy's in fact I have yet to find one and I'm working my way back in time before we let's let's start by playing this video just to set the table for those who haven't seen it I will review some of the super chats that have come in now I'll address those as soon as we're out of the video and then I want to make my case to you that there are two grounds upon which I believe Tommy should be released from prison granted bail a proper hearing scheduled and why the sentence he received was inappropriate and in fact it may be that no sense at all is appropriate so please this is this is ridiculous do you feel what we are doing I haven't said a word I think the side in fact someone laid their hand and assaulted me a strike or other people strengthened me about my mother and Here I am being arrested for saying nothing I'm not said anything about what arrest me former preacher please apparently I'm in sight in or more video can you please George huh there you have it we've all seen that before that's Tommy being whisked off the street by seven policemen we also have an image we showed you of the judge staring down from the courthouse at the hubbub and the streets now I should tell you and we'll just show that if we have that handy I'm sure we don't have that at our fingertips but I think you've seen it before it's the judge staring down at the window there was no hubbub down there Tommy Robinson was by himself in the street that's sort of the point he was very careful he did not step on court property he did not reveal any confidences when he read the names of the accused he was only doing so from the BBC story let me show you that BBC story we showed this yesterday the names of the 29 accused 27 of whom were men two were women Nessa Rafa Seine Irfan Ahmed Zubair Ahmed Mohammed Rizwan Aslam Mohammad camara Mohammad Nam and there's a lot of my I shouldn't laugh how is this anything funny at all but you see this is on the website right now this is on the BBC state broadcaster right now the Daily Mail has a similar story right now tommy was merely reading things that were already in the public domain and this is an important point I'm gonna come back to the later thanks Justin for showing these on-screen I just threw that at you with no notice I've got a hard-working team here Justin and Hannah they try and keep up with my stream of consciousness I try and give them in advance a clue of what I'm gonna mention but you never know what's gonna pop into my mind so what are we going to do today we are going to talk about the reasons why Tommy I don't think should be in prison and this is not these are not emotional reasons these are not reasons of personal affection these are not private reasons or subjective reasons I put it to you that I have two real legitimate legal reasons why Tommy should not be in jail before I do that though I'm going to read the four super tweets that came in super chats if you're kind enough to chip in a few bucks the least I can do is read your chat right I see one here I saw them come in let me just scroll down and find them in the comments for there we go Tom young John praying for God to help Tommy thank you Tom I think he does need help absolutely and you know the saying pray like it all depends on God but work like it all depends on you I think we need both in this case mr. ghost chipped in five pounds thank you and he says thank you for helping defend my freedom speech in the UK that's a shame we need outside help but we clearly need it I'm afraid that's true in fact my great feeling about this arrest of Tommy is god forbid he's away for 13 months god forbid worse things happen who would step into the breach who is the last lion out there Nigel Faraj did his tour of duty I think he's semi-retired frankly and that's fine he did amazing things for the UK but who would fill his shoes who would fight like Tommy I don't know I mean I don't know the UK well enough to say I know every activist and and fight her there but take Tommy out of the picture who's left another super chat from David Riza nurse says what's the latest with Tommy we need good news please well don't we isn't that the truth I have not had a personal communication with Tommy it is very difficult because he is in prison Primus 81 says for freedom yours and ours thank you very much okay I think I've caught up on all the super chats what I want to do today is I want to start with reading excerpts from the court on Friday I have been to the British judiciary website and in fact what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna I'm gonna put that website in the super chat panel there so you can poke around yourself there is a special page and I'm just gonna do this myself I haven't done this before but I think I'm smart enough I'm gonna paste the URL right there you see that it says rebel media with a little crown there judiciary gov dot you came and the link I just put there if you click on it will take you to the judgments for contempt of court in the United Kingdom the the judgment for Tommy's case is not yet there and I don't see the transcript of the court either now someone can find those send them to me and I'll read them the reason I mention that is because I'm relying instead on what scant reports there are in the UK media and I'm going to refer to an article in the BBC that's the state broadcaster of the United Kingdom Justin can you please put up the BBC article that has some quotes from the court hearing on Friday so remember this would have been subject to the publication ban until it was lifted yesterday do you see this article X ETL leader Tommy Robinson jailed at Leeds Court why do they keep calling him a neck CD a leader by the way he left the EDL and in fact he renounced it because he felt it was going racist that is not why Tommy is in jail he's not in jail for anything to do with the EDL at all they're just that's just the BBC the state broadcaster they have orders do that every time all right I'm going to quote we have two quotes I'm gonna highlight from the article that quote the judge on Friday and again I'm relying on the state broadcaster here because I cannot yet find the transcript of the full hearing can we put up the full quote so this is quoting from the BBC during Friday's hearing Matthew Harding defending so again this is the public defender the and I'm sure he's a good man I've got nothing against Matthew Harding I have no clue who he is but I do know two things about him number one he does not know Tommy or Tommy's history or torrent Tommy's complex legal situation number two I am most certain he is not an expert in the complicated and obscure field of contempt of court law so let me keep reading during Friday's hearing Matthew Harding good guy I'm sure but not the right man for the job defending claimed that his client had quote deep regret for what he had done so in other words he's basically pleading guilty but look at that what he had done we're gonna talk a lot more about that because what had he done and what did Matthew Harding think he had done and what did the judge think he had done deep regret for what he had done if someone comes up to you and says I'm sorry and you say for what well for what I have done well can you tell me what you what you did because maybe you've got a lot to be sorry for him maybe you have nothing to be sorry for oh I'm sorry man for what for what I've done okay put the put the text back up there he was mindful having spoken to others and taken advise not to say things that he thought would actually prejudice prejudice these proceedings mr. Harding said yes that is very relevant he did not try to cause difficulties for the court process yes that is that is true I believe that's true and I and I have a little bit of personal information about that because I was working with Tommy from here in Canada when he was arrested a year ago in Canterbury for contempt of court and and we spent an enormous amount of time effort and money getting out of prison he was briefly detained then and it was it was impressed on him most deeply to be careful not to be on court precincts with the camera not to say rapist if they're just an accused rapist not to violate privacy or prohibitions on publications and Tommy was very mindful of that so Harding got it right when he said Tommy had no intention but the law of contempt of court is is strict you don't have to prove in a regular criminal act you have to prove intent a quick example for those who are unfamiliar the Latin word is men's Raya mental guilt so if you accidentally brush up against someone in a narrow alley that is not assault or battery you accidentally brushed up against them in a crowded subway let's say that is not assault because there it may have been the actus Reyes the acts of an assault but if the mental element is not there right as opposed to purposefully punching someone Tommy Robinson clearly did not have the mental intent the mens rea are the guilty mind of committing the crime that was alleged of violating the contempt of court in a criminal matter in the criminal manner obviously Tommy did not have the mental aspect of mens rea a' but the thing about contempt of court it is a strict offense that does not require the mental element if you did it you did it and that's the problem here please put up the second quote from this story Judge Jeffrey Marcin QC that's the judge who put the prohibition man said and again I'm relying on the BBC because we don't have transcripts yet not only was it a very long video but I regard it as a serious aggravating feature that he was encouraging others to share it and it had been shared widely that is the nature of the contempt now there is another passage I don't think I have it here where the judge says I'll come up I'll refer to this one later where the judge indicates he did not watch the entire thing I don't have that quote here with me but you know that's true because the entire contempt of court hearing on Friday was very brief it was a matter of minutes yet Tommy's broadcasts that preceded that arrest by seven cops that I showed you was more than an hour I know because I watched it it was it was actually extremely long tommy was just killing time he was standing there standing standing standing standing standing standing and he was just fill-in the air time telling stories giving background giving his thought I mean it was I thought it was quite entertaining Tommy Tommy is gonna he's quite good at chatter he's loquacious but the fact that the judge did not watch the whole thing is extremely important so that's all the BBC reported and I could not find any other excerpts in other British papers and as yet I cannot find them online now look right underneath the story this is the third quote go ahead and put this up this is on the same page so right underneath it the BBC engages in a little bit of propaganda so they're trying to say Tommy's a bad man why contempt of court matters by dominica siani BBC Home Affairs corresponds so just in case you're thinking wrong thoughts people the BBC will tell you the right way to think about this let me quote this is not some new form of censorship directed at Robinson these are rules that apply to all of us equally all right I'm gonna come back to that because that it's not true if he is unsure about that he's now got time on his hands good one he's got time on his hands everybody oh yeah that's great that's great the BBC they're grading these are the rules that apply to all of us equally if he's unsure about that he's not got time on his hands to read a copy of his sense of law for journalists oh man oh the BBC they're great a yeah he's got that's a state broadcaster for yeah it's a government journalist laughing that Tommy's got time on his hands and maybe he should study the law well you know what I think in fact a lawyer should study the law and a judge who throws someone in prison for a video should probably watch the video first don't you think but no lectures from the BBC about judges being paid to spend time to read the law and watch the video upon which they condemn a man to 13 months in prison don't you think that's important and here's my point and I showed you that the BBC and I think we have a Daily Mail showing the same thing if we don't sound important every every medium in the UK reported these hot this Huddersfield a gang trial the name the 29 accused 27 men two women tommy was just reading that in public here's here's my two reasons why I think Tommy has legal grounds to be bailed to have a proper hearing and in the end to not serve a day and in fact to receive an apology I believe for wrongful imprisonment here's why number one he pled guilty is what it sounds like and I've heard that reported elsewhere the fact that he's full of regret you're full of regret that's what you say when you plead guilty you're asking for a sort of mercy from the court but pled guilty to what apologized for what for what he had done I showed you that that from the BBC but no one in that court knew what he had done other than Tommy himself the judge who threw Tommy in jail did not know what he had said the lawyer who defended Tommy may have watched the whole thing frankly I doubt he did because if he did he would have said you really didn't do anything wrong and maybe he would have said Your Honor we need some time to go through this because I believe there may be a defense here instead he was railroaded and Tommy remote you saw him remember the end of the clip call my lawyer George call my lawyer call my lawyer call my lawyer call my solicitors what they call it over the UK do you see my point he didn't get his solicitor he got some public defender and so he was unmoored Tommy knew he was in jeopardy because he had that suspended sentence from a year ago in Canterbury he was being railroaded the lawyer he was assigned didn't know him from Adam didn't understand Facebook life didn't know even I know Tommy's legal backstory part of it because I I was part of the project in Canterbury right so Tommy's regular lawyer would have known the history the lawyer who pled Tommy out probably didn't even know the full extent of Tommy's jeopardy because of the suspended sentence so you had a lawyer who was improperly briefed didn't know Tommy's background may not have even known about the Canterbury suspended sentence I don't think he actually watched the full 70 minute livestream on that improper basis obviously counseled Tommy who was stressed shocked surprised maybe even afraid counsel Tommy to plead guilty and I know enough about the law to know that when you plead guilty you expect some sort of a a magnanimous response from the court because you're pleading guilty you're accepting guilt you're expressing regret you're apologizing as Tommy did and maybe got a lenient sentence he did not he did not at all he got the most extreme sentence you can imagine I put it to you that we know for a fact the judge did not watch the whole thing he was looking out his window at Tommy he wasn't he wasn't watching the livestream the judge did not know what Tommy did before he sends him I put it to you the lawyer did not know what Tommy did before he advised him to plead guilty I put it to you the lawyer who counseled him to plead guilty likely in fact surely did not know the full extent of Tommy's past legal situation I know for a fact that the lawyer who represented Tommy on Friday was not part of our three-man legal dream team in Canterbury a year ago where we had outstanding top-notch lawyers with an expertise in this field I know for a fact that his duty counsel as public defender did not know the background did not know the history did not have the benefit of the legal memos and briefs that were produced a year ago in Canterbury that is tantamount to not having legal counsel if your legal counsel is not properly briefed if your legal counsel does not know your legal history and the particulars of your situation if the legal counsel does not have the benefit of legal advice that was paid forward and drafted for your benefit in the matters of contempt of court that is not effective legal advice that is not effective legal representation it's a it's a railroading and Tommy I know Tommy enough that he doesn't bend the knee to every cop or judge who presents Tommy knows that occasionally you're guilty but quite often you're not and I believe that if Tommy had in his hands it had with him rather a lawyer who was properly briefed and expert in the matter and had said you can fight it on this this or this ground or we'll argue in this way I'm sure Tommy would have taken that option I am quite sure in this case he was not given that option those are the two things and there's two reasons I put there number one the judge did not see all the facts in front of him he contemned he condemned Tommy for an innocuous video that contained nothing within it there was more contempt contemptuous of the court than anything published by the BBC or the mail online don't you see how important that is Tommy apologized for what did he apologize Tommy's not a lawyer you know the saying a man who represents himself has a fool for a client you ever heard that saying because you may think you're the best lawyer but you but you have blind spots about yourself you don't know what you look like you are too emotionally attached to this fact or that argument that someone with perspective can say no no that's not the issue here Tommy tommy was clearly led to believe in some way perhaps by his under-informed lawyer that he ought to plead guilty either that he had done something for which he must plead guilty or that if he pled guilty he would get some sort of leniency neither of those things happened the judge did not know what Tommy did when he called it contempt I put it to the tongue he's a lawyer did not know what he did when he when he recommended pleading guilty to contempt and even if what was in that seventy minute video was contemptuous of course even if and I put it to you and I've said to you all week that I do not believe that is a case but even if it was the case why was there this unseemly rush to judgment from arrest to prison five hours maybe the court hearing itself a matter of minutes what was so essential that we needed to race to to prison without a hearing that we couldn't do what we did in Canterbury a year ago which is Tommy's bailed on strict conditions and I remember when Tommy get got out of what Tommy was arrested at 4:00 a.m. he was taken to Canterbury he has first appearance we sent the lawyers up there Tommy was released they had to go back to court a week or two leader tommy was under strict instructions and we all really helped him stay by him don't say a word about this don't say a word about anything until we have the proper hearing why couldn't Tommy have been released on bail for a week or even for five days to have a proper defense and being told Tommy don't you do anything just go solid why couldn't the judge have said I will let you get proper representation meet with your regular lawyers and you will come back here sir and we'll have a proper hearing why was it so essential to rush to a judgement without a proper lawyer or proper time why was that why I put it to you that that the lack of a proper lawyer the fact of the judge in question here did not review the whole matter I put it to you that is grounds for setting aside the guilty plea to set aside a guilty plea and to have a proper hearing of the manner I want to show you some things that were brought to my attack and and read some read some super chats I think some have come up James brain says there was a photo of the judge from window as Tommy Robinson was being arrested this makes the judge a witness to tommy Robinson's arrest he should not have been the sentencing judge because of that well we talked about this year there's the picture there thanks very much Justin forgetting that well that's what's so weird about this and we talked about this at length in yesterday's show contempt of court the judge was angry the judge who is feels he has been treated with contempt is also the the judge of his own contempt do you see what I mean in any other normal situation you have the Pro and the con and a neutral decider the plaintiff the defendant the prosecution the accused not in contempt of court a judge who is offended gets to judge his own degree of offensive offended miss and gets to mete out judgment about his own case isn't that strange let me see if there's other super chats that I've missed I don't think there are I want to show you I may have one here let me just give me one second I if there's a super chat I don't want to miss it David R is there shipped in two dollars thank you says why would tommy plead guilty I don't believe that I do believe it because I know a man who was railroaded into pleading guilty for a very heavy matter because he was told what would happen to him if he didn't and he later applied to have that guilty plea set aside and it was miraculous he did get the guilty plea set aside and the entire case was dropped whenever you hear someone saying uh you know I didn't do it i pled guilty I didn't mean to there's a natural skepticism but I believe that Tommy was railroaded I believe he was told plead guilty and will be better for you if you don't it'll be much worse that's why I believe Tommy pled guilty and I also believe that Tommy didn't know what it was apologizing for you see what I mean the judge didn't know it's like three people having a conversation are you sorry for what you did yes I'm deeply sorry for what for what I did and each of them has a different idea of what they're talking about cuz no one actually erred facts kapa Dessau chipped in 22 that looks like Norwegian kroner Hugh the Borg resistance is not futile well it feels pretty few talent but I think we must resist mad but 3:10 p.m. cest gave the judge has decided the sharing in the court case was a contempt of court then surely his actions blowing this story up he is contempt of his own court well you know that's just layers upon layers isn't it this is a very strange situation I want to tell you some ideas that were first bruited by Jack Montgomery of Breitbart London I want to give him a shout out because I'm I've been thinking about some of his ideas so let's take it let's assume let's grant and I don't do this but just for the sake of argument that what Tommy did in that 70 minutes livestream was contemptuous of court I've said to you 5 times whoa I don't think that's the case he wasn't on court property he did not say they were convicted he just said they were alleged he did not reveal anything that was not in the public it's a turd said it said it was the last day in the trial etc but let's say the Tommy talking about a case that was before trial was contemptuous I dispute that this picture you might recognize this this is count dank EULA not his real name when he was on trial very recently for his training his girlfriend's dog to raise its paw what he said Heil Hitler it was a goofy goofy goofy joke do we have an image so hold this on the screen for a minute here so this is a mainstream media publication I think is a Daily Record man behind Nazi POG video told court Jewish comedians supported his joke Marc meek and that's the real name of counting kula said his video only caused offense because it was taken out of context so what is what are we talking about here we're showing the accused were describing what went on in court there was massive media coverage I don't think we have the image handy but I'm sure everyone is watching this has seen it of the court being jammed with reporters this is one case where the mainstream media didn't stay away they were on court property let me show you just a another example of Channel 4 show this channel for one this is channel 4 that's the news station made famous by Jordan Peters and I scroll down a little bit if you can because I want to show this picture do you see that they are on the court precinct there do you see there are on the sidewalk there's so many reporters there that they are literally pressed against the wall of the court that's what Tommy was arrested for in Canterbury that's why he was so careful not to be on the sidewalk he was in the street so when channel 4 does it and those 20 journalists do it it's cool but not Tommy and then one more example this is about a rape gang case and again Jack Montgomery Breitbart is the guy gave me this idea show the Coventry live here we go teenage girls says she was groomed before being raped by two men in court here's the girls police interview was played to a jury today this is completely normal court reportage in North America and in the UK so this was a rape gang trial I think this was in Coventry it's describing the goings-on in there this would be incendiary facts I suppose but completely lawful they were so contempt of court hearing here for those of you who watch Tommy's Facebook live you'll know that he did not even get into that detail Tommy did not actually describe the goings-on in the court and because Tommy wasn't in the court he was outside the court you see why I showed you these last three images number one count dank EULA being reported on before the verdict number two all those reporters crushed up against the wall and a story about it on channel 4 and then number three this Coventry story about a rape gang do you understand why I'm showing you those to show you that merely discussing the incendiary matters inside a court is not by definition contempt of court and I say again if you watch Tommy's Facebook live which the judge did not do Tommy did not talk about the particulars inside the courthouse he wouldn't know because he wasn't in there he was giving a general commentary about the phenomena of rape gangs in the UK do you understand how the importance of the fact that Tommy said I'm sorry but sorry for what the judge might have thought he did something else that he was apologizing for if the judge didn't know what he actually said because the judge was peering down from a brick wall behind the glass the judge didn't know what Tommy said someone might have whispered in the judges here always said this he said that instead of watching the 70 minute video the judge assumed the worst perhaps based on gossip and rumor and he said oh you've done something wrong and Tommy said well I'm sorry and they were both thinking of completely different things I don't even think it's lawyer watched in have I missed any of it missed any super chats one has come by let me redo them thank you by the way for these super chats they're they're a great way to make your chat stand out I'll I can't find it here my friends will email it to me and I'll read it oh I think I saw it there nerdy Dov with this and what happened with Alfie Evans and dank EULA the UK korie's I think you mean Tories seem completely corrupt well listen you're blaming this on one political party I tell you that politicians are just part of it you know Daniel Pipes of the Middle East for him he talks about the 5p professionals politicians the press police prosecutors and professors bike Winston say I'll start with a P it's a good way to remember them that's that's an it's a shorthand for the establishment and the entire establishment in the UK is complicit it's not just the the Tories and it's not just politicians the politicians couldn't do this without the complicity of the press and the prosecutors and the police and the judges pose and the professor's sometimes Daniel Pipes add another P priests because unfortunately sometimes even Christian priests are going along with this let me check the clock is twelve thirty five I want to show you a little bit of research that I've done and I don't know if you saw the link I posted there you can do more research of your own but can you put up on the screen a courts and tribunals judiciary publications yeah that's the one now friends we're gonna take a minute here and if you don't like it that won't hurt my feelings if you click away but if you want it if you want to learn a little bit about contempt of court rulings stay with me okay I'm going to spend about ten minutes on this you can find this in fact you know what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna post the link right in there okay I don't know if you saw that I just put the link to this ruling so you can follow along so what is this as you can see this is a website with every contempt of court ruling in the UK now they're not full full transcripts they're the rulings or the orders as they're called in this case it's sentencing remarks which is tantamount to an order so I was just going through a few of them and this one here was at Salisbury Wiltshire County Council versus Jake cook sentencing remarks we're going to go through the this is from last September not too long ago and why am I going through this you'll see soon it's someone who serially violated court orders and the will of the court on 24th of may 2017 the court made an order against Jay Cooke which included a provision forbidding him from entering an area bordered in red on an attached plan which included Sparrow Street the order was made without known as having given to Jay Cooke and a return date the order was personally served that same day with other documents do you see that so on so an order was made banning Jay Cooke from a certain place I don't know why but he was banned something Jay Cooke did on June 11th after having received the order on the third on the 30th Jake Cooke was arrested for attending a property at 19 Sparrow Street it was brought to court on June 12th the court was unable to deal with the matter that day yadda yadda point four so so so far we have a you're banned from going to a certain place you were served with that ban she knew about it then you went there and you were arrested he came to court okay so you're already breaking the rules you did something wrong to begin with you were banned from a place then you broke that ban are you with me so far I have no idea what this guy Jake Cooke did I'm just reading on the 28th of June 2017 Jake Cooke failed to answer his bail okay so he's out on bail and he didn't come back so what's this is this his third thing he's done wrong now District Judge Brooks then proceeded to hear evidence in the defendants absence and found that he the breach had been proved according to the criminal standard the judge adjourned the sentence until the defendant could be brought to court and he issued a warrant for the defense arrest cave been the next that then that judge retired and so there's a new judge I'm on point six now I'm almost done I've considered all that the defendant has said today in mitigation the defendant told the court that his mother died three and a half months ago in the last couple months he's been suffering with stress he explained the risks in the history with his kids and nine the dog ate his breakfast oh this is my favorite he has now found work it wants to pursue a career in the music industry well well that's a sure path to financial security and getting your life back on track isn't it so let me read paragraph 7 in sentencing the defendant today there are three objectives the first is punishment the second is to secure compliance the third is rehabilitation I take into account this is the first breach of the order on May 25th I'm satisfied the defendant knew that by attending Sparrow Street he would be breaching the order it is material of the breach occurred within 11 days of being served with the order as in he wouldn't have forgotten about it I'm satisfied that a custodial sentence is appropriate and that the sentence shall be one of 14 days imprisonment in order to secure compliance I considered its appropriate the sentence should be suspended consequently I intend to suspend the sentence until 25th of May 2018 the sentence is suspended on condition of there's no further breach of the order be done if there's a breach bla bla bla so you see so do you see what I'm talking about here jay cooke broke the law doing something wrong I don't know so he was ordered not to go to Sparrow Street I'm curious what's in Sparrow Street now aren't you he broke that violated it okay he was ordered to he was out on bail he broke his bail so he did something wrong in the first place he had a ban on going somewhere he broke that he was supposed to come to court he didn't he finally comes to court he has some Stobbs sob story about being stressed who the hell isn't stressed you don't think tommy is under stress and what happened here so gia how many breaches here is that three breaches would you agree with me there's three things you did wrong and did you understand the sentence here nothing 14 days in prison suspended really so you break the law three times and this judge says well you know he's stressed out and he's gonna have a great career in the music industry do you see why I give this example that's contempt of court when you're not Tommy Robinson I want to give you one more example and I'll post it on the screen so bear with me I want this this example is too good this example I'm gonna put it in the comment myself okay so if you want to follow along I just put it there you can see the rebel media it's got the check mark in the little crown business there it's 1241 this one's going to be of interest see I know it do you guys have that in the control room there yep look at that you recognize these names people in the High Court of Justice Queen's Bench division median communications list the honor roll mr. justice war be sitting in the Royal Courts of Justice this is fancy law people this ain't no Sparrow Street business in Salisbury this is fancy and look at that between George Galloway and Ayesha Ali can wow this is a little bit famous and met upon the application of the applicants dated February 20th so George Galloway and Aishah Ali Khan are fighting and there were two previous court orders you might see let me skip down skip down here it is let's skip ahead Pat I want to skip ahead okay I got to come back to the order can you go to the can you scroll down to where it says annex two application notice yes scroll down you see okay yeah perfect what I'm about to read and I'm not gonna read all of it I'm gonna read how many times miss Ali can breached her conditions and I'm just googling it here yet by the way just in case you're wondering Ayesha Ali Khan is a former aide to the George Galloway I'm gonna I'm just gonna post that in the in a thread also okay I just post a link there so you can read that on your own time so this is George Galloway fancy guy and Aishah Ali can very handsome young lady who was an aide and you'll see in that Times story she was at risk for going to jail for two years for insulting him on Twitter welcome to the UK not a lot of freedom of speech in the UK is there is there okay let's get back to how the court treated that okay so I just wanted to tell you who I shall II can it and all the Brits watching know who George Galloway is he's the crazy Hamas loving socialist Brit you see it says breach one miss Ali Khan breached undertakings she gave to the courts back in June 20th 2016 and you see it says breach one she published this on a blog she published that reached number two she published another blog I'm just scrolling I'm not gonna read all this breach number three she tweeted when I complained to my ex bar his mate for 30 years breech number 4 miss alekan breached the undertakings by tweeting breach 5 miss Ali can breached the undertakings breach 6 masala can breach it Scroll scroll breach 7 breach 8 breach 9 for each 10 keep scrolling breach 11 do you get to get my point here we're not even half done people breach 15 breathe 16 breach 20 scroll all the way down Scroll scroll Scroll scroll what am i showing you I am showing you that Asia Ally can George Galloway is former assistant broke a court order 26 times referring to litigation before the courts 26 times if you're bored you can read all of them ok now just to scroll all the way back to the top ok those were just the 26 examples so let's recap here you got George Galloway that crazy Hamas lovin politician you got is very pretty former aide I shall II can I'm sure which is a professional relationship they're embroiled in litigation as is always the case with Galloway I shall econ makes undertakings to the court on several occasions it appears not to talk about things in public you're with me so far it's a pretty simple case and you see the similarities with the case involving Tommy did she breach the undertaking yes she did 26 times not once not twice not 20 times 26 times as Abraham Lincoln would say six and and score he here's ago 26 breaches so let's go back to the top of that okay order for committal so this is when I shall accounts getting in trouble now I'm gonna read this whole thing cuz it's gorgeous upon the application of the applicant that's George Galloway and upon the court having adjourned the issue of what penalty to impose upon the respondent and upon having regard to the to court orders March 22nd and April 17th keeps going to go a little bit upon reading the respondents first affidavit and upon that undertaking by counsel to verify and upon hearing blabbity blah it has ordered that the response affidavit will be verified yada yada look at point three for her contempt the respondent stand committed to prison for a total period of 12 weeks you saw that Times story do you guys in the control room who need that time story I'll send it to you if you didn't quite see it there so so you got Aisha Aly can quarreling with Roger Galloway there are not one but two court orders saying to Aisha shush now this is a matter of litigation do not talk in public about this are you with me you got two famous people who happen to be left-wing Islamists in fact in the case of George Galloway he loves must 26 breaches not 126 and she gets 12 weeks in prison here show the story is for a second if you didn't see I shall I can former aide to George Galloway may face jail it's true it's true the former parliamentary systems George Galloway who once claimed that she had to buy underwear for him is facing a possible two years in jail for insulting him on Twitter the lengthy bitter and colorful feud between I shall account and the former MP returned to the High Court yesterday miss Ali Khan apologized in person to judge Warby for 26 contempt of court 26 contempt of court people for breaching the judge's order to stop making derogatory comments about mr. Galloway oh can I just read one more miss Ali can 36 became a Commons assistant in 2012 but they fell out when he accused her of trysts with the police these are the best people by the way I mean if for some reason I'm reminded of Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin they're just to be clear she didn't go to prison because she was insulting George Galloway she went to prison for 12 weeks my math tells me that's that's three months it's a fairly fair bit of time because she broke the judge's order 26 times so 26 breaches of two court orders yields 12 weeks in prison that 12 weeks in prison is not fun but it's a lot less than 13 months in prison ain't it and you notice one other things she had time to have a lawyer that a lot of lawyers the judge didn't think it was critical to send I shall the kind of prison within hours did it did he why was there some reason that she had to be put in jail before lunchtime in fact 26 breaches happened before she was even hauled in and how did I find this case I'm am familiar with George Galloway I was not familiar with I shall they can and I know George Galloway has a lot of things going on I just started working that link I put up beforehand you can read every single contempt of court case yourself if you're bored I encourage you to do it's very interesting reading funny cases I'm curious what was on that sparrow road and Salsbury this Ashish alekan story is very instructive because there were not one but two court orders against it high profile in violation of court orders to not talk about pending litigation in public she was convicted 12 weeks is not nothing but in ain't 13 months and she was allowed to get a lawyer and instruct the lawyer and prepare a case why wasn't Tommy why was it so imperative for Tommy Robinson to be thrown in prison immediately not even a phone call to his wife her family couldn't even chat with his lawyer who I understand was on a plane at the time why does I shot Ali Khan get 12 weeks I'm not saying that's nothing although I bet she was out early everyone gets out early coming and getting out early unless there's an appeal its 1251 I don't want to spend too much time because we only have nine minutes left I see there's another super chat as zuray says sorry to go off-topic Ezra but I was wondering if the rebel we're currently hiring is there somewhere I can fly for a position or sanding the resume yeah you can email us at careers or career at the rebel damn idiots on our it's on our website I think there's one more super chat let me find that french toast mafia says is it true that Tommy gave the judge of fake ad yes I have not heard that I don't think it's relevant even if it were true if it were true and we're speculating here and there's so many rumors out that I would not rely on that I know for a fact the tummy is in challenging situations because when his personal residence is anywhere publicized terrorists and would-be murderers literally come to his house so if he would have given the judge a different address where the judge there's it's not hard to find Tommy Robinson the police know exactly where he lives if Tommy didn't want to say in open court where his home address was I quite understand because he would then have to sell this house and move or worse god forbid his family would be in jeopardy there's one more Super chat let me see if I can find it quickly v6 rock on rabble as for you the best well thank you very much it's 1253 can i sum up what we talked about today we talked about two things we talked about what went on on Friday that should not have gone on and we talked about other sentences for contempt of court let me wrap up for those who join now Tommy Robinson was sentenced to contempt of court for what he said in a 70 minute Facebook live stream that the judge did not see so how does the judge know Tommy was in contempt of court if the judge did not see it or did not see all of it how is that even possible I also suggest that it's quite likely that the lawyer did not watch the full video we know for a fact that the lawyer did not know Tommy his background have access to Tommy's files on contempt of court and was surely not an expert in contempt of court so we know that Tommy did not have effective legal counsel sure he had someone standing there who was a barrister solicitor whichever on the Split profession he was I forget how it works in the UK sure was a lawyer but wasn't an informed lawyer wasn't a lawyer with the expertise was the lawyer who knew the client was a lawyer who had access to the clients files in the specific field of contempt of court law but somehow Tommy was convinced to plead guilty either because the lawyer at hand said you got to do it you or because you're so guilty or because the lawyer may have led Tommy to believe you he pled guilty there would be a lenient outcome neither of which happened so I put it to you number one Tommy had ineffective representation and his guilty plea should be withdrawn and the matter should be retried the second and obvious point is why the rush why was it essential to get this done so speedily that's another reason to set aside the sentence withdraw the guilty plea and have a proper hearing one of the things we spent our time today talking about but the second thing I think it's just as important would you not agree with me that I sha Ali can and George Galloway are high-profile people in a high-profile litigation it's different in character than a rape gang trial and lead Ziya grant you that but there was not one but two court orders against Ayesha alekan not to blab about it not to talk about it and she breached those two orders not one time about 26 times and unlike Tommy she obviously did so willfully tommy was trying his best to be very careful not to do so mmm can you explain for me why Tommy's in prison for 13 months for an inadvertent breach which I suggests was not actually a breach whereas I shall I can was sentenced to just 12 weeks and I know that's a sentence I don't know she served it all I doubt she did why the double standard I showed you the other case of was a Jake cook from Salisbury who did something wrong broke a court ordered ban on where to go broke a bail order and the judge says well you know give you a few days but I'm gonna suspend that sentence because you told me you're going to become a rock star and so you're really on your path again not a date not a date not a day for him it's obvious why it's obvious why by the way the rule of law means no one is above the law it also means no one is below the law it means if you're fancy you have to be held to the law but if you're unfair for working class if you're a Tommy Robinson if you're the people that everyone looks down the nose at you still have the same rights isn't that what the rule of law means I see a super chef from Cromwell one three six four nine if a political activist had been thrown in jail the press had been prevented from reporting it anywhere else in the world you'd see British politicians falling over themselves to condemn it oh yeah where's Amal Clooney you don't think I'm all Clooney would've been all over it oh I tell you she would where's Amnesty International their UK outfit aren't there maybe they were French or something where's amnesty where's Bono where's bono Oh he'd be all over it if it was some Lefty where's JK Rowling because you know she's big in a free expression being an author an artiste where's she where's she it's 1257 what we do every day at 12:00 noon Eastern Time 5 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time 9:00 a.m. on the west coast is we have this little chat I hope I've read all the super chats that game through I'm sorry I haven't had a chance to look at some of the others maybe I'll just close the show that way about 2 minutes conservative active he pleaded guilty because his dumb lawyer told him to I'm not going to call his lawyer dumb I'm going to call his lawyer in experienced in the area of contempt of court law most likely and completely unfamiliar with Tommy's background but so he's not dumb he's just completely ill-suited and he should have tried to get some sort of an adjournment he should certainly not have tried to convince Tommy to plead guilty that's my view Frank a.m. where's Nigel I wish British conservatives and I mean lowercase C not capital C stood with Tommy you and they can preface it by saying oh I don't agree with all his taxes yeah yeah we know that we know that but that's the thing about free speech you have to stand up for people even if you don't like them or agree with them because if you want free speech free stuff you have to stand up for for others as well I wish Nigel would engage here the current head of you you Kip Gerard batten I think his name has give him credit I read a couple more here test Tommy's IQ listen I don't know if Tommy's I don't know the full extent of his schooling but I don't think he had post-secondary education I can assure you he is one of the brightest people I've met extremely well-read his vocabulary is large yeah there's a lot of swearing in there too for punctuation but if you if for a second you don't think Tommy is bright you don't understand Tommy listen I went to university for seven years Tommy can hold his own with me on any subject and I am a student of his when it comes to the matter of Islam let me put it this way Tommy Robinson had the number one best-selling book in the UK several times including for his book and annotated Koran Tommy can go toe-to-toe with any scholar of theology there is it's almost 1:00 p.m. so we're gonna wrap up I feel like I covered some ground here I feel like we talked about something new which is precedence in the United Kingdom for contempt of court including political repeated brazen contempt of court in the case of Aishah Alec and would you agree with me on that would you agree with me that perhaps that is the better comparator then the case of Jay Cooke in Salisbury nine Sparrow Road would you agree with me that if someone breaks an order 26 times two orders and they get 12 weeks that it's insane for Tommy to get 13 months would you agree with me on that especially since I shall they can't had time to hire and instruct a proper lawyer I say again Tommy should have his guilty plea set aside he should be released from prison on bail he should have the right to a proper hearing it's 1:00 p.m. so I'm gonna sign off for those of you who are interested every day at 8 p.m. Eastern I have a show behind a paywall it's called the Ezra Levant show it's more scripted it's less rambling I don't take comments like this I read some letters at the end you to subscribe to that at the rebel dawn media slash shows for those of you who like the super chat format I'll be back tomorrow at 12 noon Eastern until then on behalf of all of us here at rubber World Headquarters keep fighting for freedom you
