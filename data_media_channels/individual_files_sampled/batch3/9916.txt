HOWIE: THE VITRIOL BEING UNLEASHED AGAINST SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS IS STUNG AND SAD. SHE AND HER FAMILY WERE KICKED OUT OF A RESTAURANT CALLED THE RED HEN FOR MORAL REASONS AND SO SHE LEFT. SHE TWEETED THAT HER ACTIONS SAY MORE ABOUT HER THAN ME. THE REACTION BY SOME TRUMP-BASHING PUNDITS, YEAH, RIGHT, SHE DESERVED IT. YOU MAKE CHOICES IN LIFE. AND THERE IS A COST TO BEING AN ACCOMPLICE TO THIS CRUEL, DECEITFUL ADMINISTRATION. HOWIE: MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR IN THE "WASHINGTON POST," IT'S NATURAL AND APPROPRIATE FOR DECENT HUMAN BEINGS TO SHAME AND SHUN THE PRACTITIONERS OF SUCH A POLICY. IF A BARACK OBAMA SPOKESMAN HAD BEEN BOOTED FROM A RESTAURANT. WHAT'S NEXT. IS IT OKAY TO PICKET PEOPLE'S HOUSES LIKE WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY AT KIRSTJEN NIELSEN'S TOWNHOUSE IN VIRGINIA.
