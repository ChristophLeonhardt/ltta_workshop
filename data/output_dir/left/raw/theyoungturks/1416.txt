1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,889
AN ALABAMA SHERIFF HAS BEEN
VOTED OUT OF OFFICE.

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:06,520
THIS WAS A SHERIFF WHO MADE
HEADLINES AFTER IT WAS

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,830
REPORTED THAT HE TOOK MONEY FROM
A PRISON FOOD FUND IN ORDER

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,460
TO FUND HIS OWN HOME.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,820
BY THE WAY, HE HAD MULTIPLE
HOMES.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,500
THIS IS TODD ENTREKIN.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:28,060
A 
REPUBLICAN HAS REPLACED HIM

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,060
AND

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,730
IT DOESN'T APPEAR HAS ANY
CHALLENGERS.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,730
THIS IS THE

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,960
PRIMARY ELECTION AND NO ONE
APPEARS TO BE CHALLENGING

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,470
JONATHAN HORTON BUT HE DID
CALL HIM OUT IN REGARD TO

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:51,000
STEALING THIS MONEY FROM THE
PRISON FOOD FUND.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,540
BY THE WAY CREDIT TO THE LOCAL
COMMUNITY BECAUSE THIS

15
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,470
REALLY DID RAISE SOME RED
FLAGS FOR THEM.

16
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,240
THEY NOTICED HE HAD MULTIPLE
HOMES AND THEY ARE LIKE YOU

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,730
ARE A SHERIFF, WHERE DID THIS
MONEY COME FROM?

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,720
GREAT JOB ON BREAKING THE
STORY OVERALL.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,920
HE IS LIKE THE 750 I TOOK FROM
THERE, AND THE MONEY I

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,690
SPENT FOR MY HOME, TOTAL
COINCIDENCE.

21
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,550
HE HAD GIVEN A PRESS
CONFERENCE AFTER THE STORY

22
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,430
BROKE AND THE PRESS CONFERENCE
WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

23
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,700
I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU THE
VIDEO TO REMIND YOU IF YOU

24
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,250
FORGOT OR HADN'T SEEN IT.

25
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,250
TAKE A LOOK.

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,880
OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, ME,
MY FAMILY, MY OFFICE, THE

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,980
CITIZENS OF OUR COUNTY
HAVE BEEN TARGETS OF

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,270
MISCELLANEOUS FAKE NEWS STORIES.

29
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,250
THIS IS A JAIL.

30
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,710
THIS IS NOT A BED-AND-BREAKFAST.

31
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,159
IF YOU ARE USED TO EATING
GRANDMA'S FRIED CHICKEN AND

32
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,490
ORDERING PIZZA SEVERAL TIMES A
WEEK YOU ARE NOT GOING TO

33
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,490
BE HAPPY.

34
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,490
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

35
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,320
IF IT IS WRONG, SOMEONE NEEDS TO
CHANGE THE LAW.

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,670
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT ALL TO
CHARITY SO THERE IS NO QUESTION?

37
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,490
THIS IS LIKE ANYBODY WHO GETS
HERE AND WORKS EVERY DAY AND

38
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,220
IT IS AT THE END OF THE DAY, IF
YOU MAKE A PROFIT, IT IS YOURS.

39
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,020
BUT THIS IS PUBLIC SERVICE.

40
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,949
I ASKED TO BE THE SHERIFF AND
IT CAME WITH THAT JOB.

41
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,660
I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU
HAPPY.

42
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,600
THAT IS AMAZING.

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,950
HE JUST TALKED ABOUT MAKING A
PROFIT AS SHERIFF.

44
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,060
HE SAYS, FRIED CHICKEN, YOU KNOW
WITH THE FOOD WAS?

45
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,000
IT WAS LITERALLY LABELED NOT FIT
FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,950
HE IS LIKE THAT SOUNDS GOOD,
WE'RE GOING TO SAVE SOME

47
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,150
MONEY AND I'M GOING TO POCKET
MY PROFIT.

48
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,520
I AM GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE EAT
FOOD NOT FIT FOR HUMAN

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,980
CONSUMPTION.

50
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,730
HE SAYS I DIDN'T NECESSARILY
SPEND IT ON MY HOUSE OR OTHER

51
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,730
THINGS.

52
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,791
ON THE CHECK THAT WAS
FOUND, ONE OF THE ITEMS WAS FOR

53
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:45,791
A KID WHO WAS

54
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:51,490
MOWING HIS LAWN AND ON THE CHECK
WERE PRINTED THE WORDS SHERIFF

55
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:57,130
TODD ENTREKIN'S FOOD PROVISION
ACCOUNT.

56
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,470
THAT IS WHAT HE KEPT TAKING FROM
INSTEAD OF GIVING IT TO THE

57
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,470
PRISONERS.

58
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,569
I WAS CURIOUS WHY WE HAD TO
WAIT UNTIL HE GOT ELECTED

59
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,070
OUT OF OFFICE, RIGHT?

60
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,100
I THOUGHT SHOULDN'T HE BE
PROSECUTED FOR THIS?

61
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,430
IT TURNS OUT HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T
BREAK THE LAW.

62
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,459
THAT IS THE THING THAT SHOULD
UPSET EVERYONE AND THE LAWS

63
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,750
NEED TO BE CHANGED BECAUSE THIS
IS A LAW PROTECTING HIM NOT

64
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,430
ONLY IN ALABAMA BUT IN SEVERAL
OTHER STATES AS WELL.

65
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,459
ALABAMA HAS A DEPRESSION ERA
LAW THAT ALLOWS SHERIFFS TO

66
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,470
KEEP AND RETAIN UNSPENT MONEY
FROM FOOD PROVISION ACCOUNTS.

67
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,270
SHERIFFS ACROSS THE STATE TAKE
EXCESS MONEY AS PERSONAL INCOME

68
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,360
AND IN THE EVENT OF A SHORTFALL
ARE PERSONAL LIABLE FOR COVERING

69
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,420
THE GAPS.

70
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,440
WHAT HE DID WAS HE
TOOK THAT MONEY FOR HIMSELF AND

71
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,959
THEN GAVE THE PRISONERS FOOD BUT
THAT FOOD WAS NOT FIT FOR

72
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,040
HUMAN CONSUMPTION SO A CASE
COULD BE MADE THAT WHAT HE DID

73
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,700
WAS UNLAWFUL BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
THERE WAS A SHORTFALL

74
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,930
WHICH LED TO THE PRISONERS
EATING FOOD THAT WAS NOT

75
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,459
SAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION BUT
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GO AFTER

76
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:00,160
HIM AND THESE LAWS NEED TO BE
WIPED OUT.

77
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,280
DEPRESSION ERA LAW SHOULD NOT BE
HERE ANYMORE.

78
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,550
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE ORIGINAL
PRIVATE PRISONS, RIGHT?

79
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,230
IF YOU GIVE A SHERIFF AN
INCENTIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT HE

80
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,740
DOES NOT TREAT HIS PRISONERS
DECENTLY AND HE CAN KEEP THE

81
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,129
PROFITS FROM THAT BAD TREATMENT,
THEN YOU INCENTIVIZE THEM

82
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:22,710
TO DO THAT TERRIBLE TREATMENT SO
HE CAN MAKE MORE MONEY AND

83
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,670
SO IT IS UNSURPRISING THAT YOU
HAVE THE SHERIFF DOING IT.

84
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,320
MAYBE HE IS DOING IT ON A HUGE
SCALE AND THAT IS WHY IT

85
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,089
STUCK OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB IN
THE MIDDLE OF ALABAMA, BUT

86
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:35,949
I BET YOU THIS IS ON THE BOOKS
IN A LOT OF THE STATES,

87
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:38,850
THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF
SHERIFFS ABUSING THEIR

88
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,900
DETAINEES SO THEY CAN MAKE
ABOUT.

89
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,669
THEY DON'T HAVE TO REPORT
THAT HIS INCOME SO IT IS

90
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,279
HARD TO TRACK HOW OFTEN AND HOW
MUCH THEY DO THIS.

91
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,870
IT IS RIDICULOUS THAT THEY
DON'T HAVE TO REPORT THAT

92
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,430
IS INCOME SO WE SHOULD BE
TRACKING THIS AND GETTING

93
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,710
ALL OF THESE LAWS OF THE BOOKS.

94
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,130
BY THE WAY, CREDITS OF THE
VOTERS AN ALABAMA DIET IS

95
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,379
NOT A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN
ISSUE, THEY REPLACED HIM

96
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:00,930
WITH THE REPUBLICAN BUT THEY
SAID YOU HAVE TO GO, THIS

97
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:10,400
IS TERRIBLE CORRUPTION 
AND THEY

98
00:05:10,400 --> 00:00:00,000
WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
