we have breaking news to report we learned just minutes ago that former President George Herbert Walker Bush has been hospitalized with an infection that has spread to his blood the former president has admitted to was admitted to Houston Methodist Hospital yesterday morning just one day after the funeral for his wife former first lady barbara Bush former bush president of Bush 43 a White House communications director Nicole Wallace joins us right now by phone to call this is amazing we didn't know what had happened until now that he's been in serious situation at the hospital yeah listen those who you know and love the Bush family it's another heartbreak but in some ways the conversation we've all been having since we learned about this yesterday is that it's sort of beautiful I mean you know you can still fly of a broken heart and if you think about the week that this man had he held his wife's hand while she died he went to the church where people the public went to greet Barbara Bush and she you know was there to welcome people that wasn't part of the plan he you know for the most part was stoic during the funeral and he's just had an unbelievably emotional week and he's not you know superb held himself so to hear that this week took a toll on his health is not is not a tremendous surprise but it's just you know I mean I you and I both covered with you know Saturday and you heard me say it it feels like the beginning of the end of an era and certainly on the heels of the loss of Barbara Bush to think about losing this beyond who whether you voted for never didn't vote for him his post-presidency has been everything that you hope for he's formed deep and meaningful bonds with the man who defeated him in Bill Clinton he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama so he's he's you know to to Republicans in exile he's everything that's good and great about you know party that we don't recognize anymore so it's a blow on some levels to hear that he's in Suffolk today just to give an update to everyone a recap of what you said yeah he apparently got through a Saturday night at with dinner with his family after the funeral and the burial but then when he awoke Sunday morning I guess emotionally was the first time we've been alone on this earth since the 40s that's a really really important thing to note and and you know you read about these things you read about what that blow can do to your physical health and that that might have been it he was taken to the hospital Sunday morning I understand yesterday was a more difficult day for him medically than today has been there's they're they're using words like stable but he's you know I think it's the family statement says he's in intensive care and those who love him are praying but it's not always clear what we're praying for I mean obviously spent 73 years with her and and it's hard not to think that at some level he he'd be happier and the agreement peace with his beloved wife but you know certainly that I could speak for his his kids weren't ready they didn't see this coming he got through the week looking well and looking strong and trying to support and cheer others of you is you have that footage of him at the church which was you know in in Secret Service lingo and OTR was supposed to go to the church the day before the official funeral which was only for invited guests and he saw it on TV and wanted to go he was going to be there five minutes he spent 20 so it was it was you know it would be a lot for you or me but I think for someone of his health and and you know Ted a 73 year love affair with Barbara Bush it may have been too much physically for him I call you were great on Saturday it was so great to hear you were exactly the service and I was so lucky to be a part of this very spiritual morning on Saturday thank you so much Nicole Wallace thank you right now sure thank you're joining us now is presidential historian Jon Meacham meets him you were also fantastic although as was a job who took a shot at you saying you were a bit too long on Saturday but I thought you were very sublime and uh tell us what you know about this emotional connection between the former president former first lady that apparently is that had affected him perhaps of physically and medically in the last 24 hours well this was Sunday morning was the first morning he woke up without her in his life since shortly after Pearl Harbor so I think we're they think it let's just pause for one second and think about that for much of the American Century they have been together they face the remarkable vicissitudes of political and familial life they raised a big wonderful family they lost a daughter to leukemia when they got married in January of 45 there was every expectation that he'd be headed back for the invasion of the home islands she as I was privileged to say on Saturday she was one of those American women who worked on an assembly line and who waited and watched in the in the long the long hours of the night for him I think all of us have in who have been lucky enough to observe that marriage and in fact the whole country has it's always been incredibly genuine and I think that he in the last years since he became he went into the wheelchair which has now been about six years ago as you know Chris he was the most active of men one of the great athletes who was ever president actually yeah was always moving he was 65 years ice to say he was 65 years old for 20 years hey there
