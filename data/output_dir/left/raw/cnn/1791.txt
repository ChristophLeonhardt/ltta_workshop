1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470
today President Trump went on the record
against Senator Paul tweeting this Rand

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,730
Paul is a friend of mine but he is such
a negative force when it comes to fixing

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,340
health care graham cassidy bill is great
ends Obama care Senator Rand Paul is

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,900
joining us now live from Capitol Hill so
let me get your response senator to what

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,460
the criticism you're receiving from the
president you know actually I still

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,300
think I'm a very positive force and
actually positively working with the

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,449
President on different ideas the idea
that I've been working with the

8
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,020
president for about six months on is
much better than Graham Cassady and that

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,760
would be allowing people to buy across
state lines insurance through a group so

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,360
if you're a carpenter or a plumber you
get to join a big Association and

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,230
through that association get cheaper
insurance and also get some of the

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,320
protections that people want from their
insurance and I continue to work with

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,520
the President on that I'm just not with
him on Graham Cassady because Graham

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,180
Cassady actually keeps most of the Obama
care spending and it just sort of

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,469
reshuffles it so instead of Obama care
funding going to California

16
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,750
it gets reshuffled to Republican states
and so I I think I see it really more as

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,040
sort of you know petty partisanship
hey let's reshuffle the deck and give

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,390
the money to the Republican states but
let's keep the Obama care spending my

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,360
concern is the debt we have a seven
hundred billion dollar debt how are we

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,040
gonna pay for all this but as you know
there's a deadline September 30th after

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,110
September 30th under the complex rules
of the US Senate you can't just get

22
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,130
anything passed with 50 votes you need
60 votes in other words you'll need

23
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,829
Democrats is the 52-48 Republican
majority in the US Senate and on some of

24
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,520
the other specific legislation that you
want like being able to buy health

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,049
insurance across state lines you
definitely need 60 votes for that do you

26
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,100
have is it realistic at all to think
you're going to be able to achieve what

27
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,119
you're calling for well the interesting
thing is is we've been working with the

28
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,570
Trump administration on this for six
months now we think they can do it

29
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,799
through presidential interpretation of
existing law so there was a law passed

30
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,299
the 1970s that allows groups to form
across state lines many corporations

31
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,440
already do this this is the one area of
the insurance market where premiums have

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,530
been relatively flat we think that the
administration

33
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,120
is going to in the next week or two
issue a ruling saying that guess what

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,690
individuals are going to be able to buy
across state lines we think they can do

35
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,459
it without any bill or legislation from
Congress and here's the thing my

36
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,930
proposal that I'm working on the
president with cost zero dollars the

37
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,540
Cassidy Graham bill is gonna spend a
trillion dollars

38
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,010
it keeps the Obama care spending but
just reshuffles who gets it that to my

39
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,850
mind is not what I promised the voters I
promised repeal I didn't promise I would

40
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,650
sort of keep most of it and just
reshuffle who gets the proceeds so when

41
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,790
I hear you saying a senator as if this
legislation doesn't pass the president

42
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,950
will begin using executive orders
executive decisions to change the

43
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,540
current Obamacare law is that what is
that what you're suggesting well not

44
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,120
really it's it's a little more
complicated than that because we don't

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,290
think it has anything to do with the
Obamacare law the Obamacare law did not

46
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,709
prevent people from buying across state
lines and forming associations like

47
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:16,920
buying co-ops it acts as a 1974 law nor
ERISA law so we think that the law has

48
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,519
been misinterpreted and could be
reinterpreted by the Trump

49
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,630
administration to allow many people they
may be you join a credit union

50
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,920
maybe you joined the Restaurant
Association and that may be people who

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,850
work in the fast food industry a lot of
whom don't have insurance now could

52
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,880
actually get it by buying it through one
of these coops because they can get

53
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,079
inexpensive insurance but my point is
I'm offering a free market plan where

54
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,700
you get freedom of choice Cassidy and
Graham are offering just a big

55
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,840
government variation of Obamacare that
sticks it to the Democrat states and

56
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,530
takes the money and gives it to
Republican states but really keeps most

57
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,359
of the Obamacare spending and that's not
something I'm for is there any wiggle

58
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:03,450
room at all in this legislation in this
this are graham cassidy bill are there

59
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,829
any changes that could potentially make
between now and a vote next week that

60
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:11,970
would result in a yay vote from you well
the interesting thing is there are

61
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,660
several things in it I would agree to if
they take the things that are good in it

62
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,829
we could keep expansion of the health
savings accounts getting rid of the

63
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,700
mandate taxes and penalties and the
Medicaid reform I'm for all three of

64
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,060
those I'm just not for the spending
proposal I'm not for

65
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,750
affirmative ly saying hey let's keep a
trillion dollars worth of Obama care

66
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,220
spending I'm not for the spending but
that's my main objection to the bill so

67
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,030
if they want to make it less about
spending and more about repealing I'm

68
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,930
for repeal the House Speaker Paul Ryan
says whatever the Senate passes the

69
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,340
house will pass next week without change
and send it to the president for his

70
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,630
signature what's your message to the
Speaker of the House Paul Ryan the

71
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,650
speaker's been wrong many times before
on counting votes I would have him ask

72
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,540
everybody in California every Republican
there 14 Republican Congressmen are they

73
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,710
happy with the fact that the new formula
will take 27 billion dollars from

74
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,070
California look there's a lot of
Republican Congressmen in New York and

75
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,000
California is about 25 of them they're
in very competitive districts are they

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,930
willing to go home to a competitive
district and say hey I just voted for a

77
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,350
bill that will take billions of dollars
from New York and California and give it

78
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,100
to North Dakota and Mississippi you know
that's what this is about it's a formula

79
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,780
fight it's a food fight over money so
we're gonna reshuffle the deck but it is

80
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,960
not a principle repeal of Obamacare but
you understand by your opposing graham

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,550
Cassidy and maybe you know let's say two
other Republicans also opposed it

82
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,410
Obamacare stays the law of the land
that's what it is angering the president

83
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,450
right now in effect you're supporting
Obamacare very quickly your response you

84
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,900
know what I would say is that I think
voters are pretty smart the Republicans

85
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,800
in my state know that nobody's been
louder voice for repealing this they

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,600
also know that seven Republicans who
said they would repeal voted for repeal

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,979
in 2015 and then changed their mind so
when I go home I don't expect people

88
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,370
gonna look at me they're gonna look to
the seven senators who actually worked

89
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,050
from Kentucky who were Republicans
promised to repeal voted once to repeal

90
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,710
and then switch their minds if anybody
wants to blame anybody I think there's a

91
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,180
lot of blame to go around there Senator
Rand Paul of Kentucky thanks so much for

92
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,590
joining us I should point out like
senator Cassidy you also are a physician

93
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,789
so I you've dealt your whole
professional career in these issues

94
00:06:32,789 --> 00:00:00,000
involving health care thanks very much
for joining us thank you
