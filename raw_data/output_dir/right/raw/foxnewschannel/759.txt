1
00:02:22,714 --> 00:02:24,816
SRCHGHTS IF YOU WANT A DEGREE,

2
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:28,353
YOU NEED TO STOPWATCHING SO MUCH

3
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:30,188
-- STOP   WATCHING SO MUCH TV.

4
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:31,956
WE'VE GOT TO BE MORE GENUINE,

5
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:33,291
SAY I WANT EVERYTHING THAT GOD

6
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:38,663
HAS FOR MY LIFE AND SO GOD WANTS

7
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:40,265
INCREDIBLE THINGS FOR YOUR LIFE.

8
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:42,400
IF YOU GO ALL-IN, GOD WILL GO

9
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,468
ALL OUT.

10
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:44,535
>> WHY ARE THE NUMBERS

11
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:45,737
CONTINUING TO GO DOWN?

12
00:02:45,737 --> 00:02:47,972
HOW DO WE AS A SOCIETY, AS A

13
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:48,673
COUNTRY, FIX THAT?

14
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:50,408
HOW DO WE SAY MORE OF US NEED TO

15
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:53,511
BELIEVE IN SOMETHING BIGGER THAN

16
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:53,912
OURSELVES?

17
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:55,113
>> ABSOLUTELY.

18
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:55,847
IT IS.

19
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:59,884
BACK IN THE '50s THEY WON'T

20
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:00,818
IMAGINE HAVING LITTLE LEAGUE AND

21
00:03:00,818 --> 00:03:02,553
OTHER THINGS ON SUNDAY BECAUSE

22
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:03,521
CHURCH WAS THAT IMPORTANT.

23
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:04,555
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S BECOME MORE

24
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:06,557
AND A MORE CASUAL AND SO WE KIND

25
00:03:06,557 --> 00:03:08,760
OF AA PREACH CHURCH AND --

26
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,929
APPROACH CHURCH AND GOD THE WAY

27
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:12,530
WE WANT TO APPROACH IT AND THE

28
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,166
INVOLVEMENT WE WANT AND SO LIFE

29
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:15,667
GETS BUSY.

30
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:16,567
THINGS GET BUSY.

31
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:17,535
I GET ALL THAT.

32
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:18,803
I REALLY DO.

33
00:03:18,803 --> 00:03:20,238
BUT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO STOP

34
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:21,839
AND SAY OKAY, GOD, IF YOU'RE A

35
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:23,474
GOD THAT LOVES US, YOU'RE A GOD

36
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:25,276
THAT WANTS THE ABSOLUTE BEST FOR

37
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:27,612
OUR LIVES, GOD, WE'VE GOT TO GO

38
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:27,946
ALL-IN.

39
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:29,580
AND THAT'S WHAT PASTORS -- I

40
00:03:29,580 --> 00:00:00,000
TALK TO A LOT OF PASTORS ACROSS
