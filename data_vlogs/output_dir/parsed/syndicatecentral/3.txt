just beat that one to win all right this
is some nice side men joggers you got
that good thanks Tom Thanks
wow that was a lot of buildup for
nothing winner stays on boom good game
okay captain - game - to be me versus
Sarah Sarah let you go first
I think you gotta get low to the ground
like you know he's doing it that's a
tactic try bounce by anybody I felt like
if it touches the back row it should be
done like real balls
and when you got close to it was so soft
I think you ever touch the back wall
shouldn't count left that's why you got
to get a nice a nice curvature yeah like
it both actually that's why you're gonna
walk that's winning or is it ok let's
the final go thanks to my clones are
like dividing a bit suicide this is
close because this one that mind winning
Simon Colin or more to a finish here
wait that one's that's perfectly even
I would now my final rival a lot both
Technica everything overall the tactic
is it explodes in the ground doesn't
move I think you two should play for
something like forfeit tomorrow as well
loser has to gather hustle no yes
charity loser has to gather hair for
charity for charity my niece eats a the
loser has to donate thousand pounds too
and 70 charity lose against the tweet of
the other person once we please get off

off my account
he's drawn on my face
stop doing mobile where you going to buy

hell he went for the over of like that's
the tactic right pull opinion this could
end badly and now the end is near and so
I face the final curtain cause you what

buggying and all that sort of stuff
which it did go and do and it was
awesome so you'll see that guys in
tomorrow's vlog book
I seem to apologize for today's vlog
even being late or whatever because when
I checked out the hotel again I thought
that clips it uploaded via Dropbox on my
phone and they didn't so I sent Byron
half the footage then deleted all the
footage then resented him and I'm
currently in a suite in a hotel with
another suite actually I can't leave the
hotel I just came from was a suite
booked in a new hotel with a new
destination and a new adventure awaiting
so can I tell you guys about that until
tomorrow however I can't say thank you
for tuning in for this if you were games
con in Middle East it was absolute
incredible I had such a good time
meeting people it was just insane to
think that I even have viewers out here
you know I bump into people around the
world but never thought I'd have this
many viewers in Abu Dhabi in the
slightest so thank you so much for
coming out it was incredible to meet so
many of you it was really cool to meet
people as well who were on holiday just
happened to be in Abu Dhabi or Dubai and
had traveled just to that event to meet
your safety or even from the UK all that
these people from Australian stuff
wallah just crazy that people had come
out of the way to just come and say hi
so I really really appreciate guys it's
incredible but I need to get showered

probably can't see it on my face but
I've got sand in my hair sand everywhere

what we can do either either way I'm
tired I need to get a shower I didn't
need to get this day rocking and rolling
I'm sending these clips as we speak to
Byron it says he's gonna take two hours

long-ass time to it to get the blog up

little bit but yeah I'm just exhausted
