DIDN’T. >> HE’S INCAPABLE OF CRITICAL

37
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:02,729
>> HE’S INCAPABLE OF CRITICAL SELF-REFLECTION, INCAPABLE OF A

38
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,831
SELF-REFLECTION, INCAPABLE OF A KIND OF SELF-ASSESSMENT WHICH

39
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:09,003
KIND OF SELF-ASSESSMENT WHICH WILL ALLOW HIM TO SAY WE MADE

40
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:10,304
WILL ALLOW HIM TO SAY WE MADE MISTAKES.

41
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:11,238
MISTAKES. MISTAKES

00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:12,339
MISTAKES. WHAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT THAT

44
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:13,774
WHAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR PRESSER IS HE DIDN’T

45
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,342
PARTICULAR PRESSER IS HE DIDN’T MENTION ONE PERSON WHO DIED, HE

46
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:17,411
MENTION ONE PERSON WHO DIED, HE DIDN’T SAY OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO

47
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:20,447
DIDN’T SAY OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THE 2,975 PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAD.

48
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,449
THE 2,975 PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAD. WE WANT -- HE DIDN’T SHOW ANY

49
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,650
WE WANT -- HE DIDN’T SHOW ANY SENSE OF EMPATHY.

50
00:01:23,652 --> 00:01:26,187
SENSE OF EMPATHY. AND THAT’S BECAUSE IN SOME

51
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:27,354
AND THAT’S BECAUSE IN SOME SIGNIFICANT WAY DONALD TRUMP IS

52
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:30,257
SIGNIFICANT WAY DONALD TRUMP IS A DEEPLY, MORALLY FLAWED HUMAN

53
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:30,557
A DEEPLY, MORALLY FLAWED HUMAN BEING.

54
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:32,326
BEING. I’VE CALLED HIM INDECENT.

55
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:34,762
I’VE CALLED HIM INDECENT. AND SO HIS RESPONSE TO THE

56
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:35,796
AND SO HIS RESPONSE TO THE TRAGEDY OF PUERTO RICO, AND

57
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:37,331
TRAGEDY OF PUERTO RICO, AND LET’S REMEMBER IT’S NOT JUST

58
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,766
LET’S REMEMBER IT’S NOT JUST SIMPLY HURRICANE MARIA,

59
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,235
SIMPLY HURRICANE MARIA, HURRICANE IRMA AND MARIA, WHAT

60
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,137
HURRICANE IRMA AND MARIA, WHAT IT DID TO THE VIRGIN ISLANDS,

61
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:44,739
IT DID TO THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, AND ST. THOMAS IS STILL

62
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,773
AND ST. THOMAS IS STILL STRUGGLING, AND THAT THEY DON’T

63
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:47,208
STRUGGLING, AND THAT THEY DON’T COME INTO VIEW, IT HAS SOMETHING

64
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:48,476
COME INTO VIEW, IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT HE IS

65
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:50,678
TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT HE IS SUCH A NARCISSIST, THAT IN THAT

66
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:51,979
SUCH A NARCISSIST, THAT IN THAT MOMENT HE CAN’T THINK OF ANYONE

67
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:52,279
MOMENT HE CAN’T THINK OF ANYONE ELSE.

68
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,014
ELSE. >> HE DOESN’T VIEW THEM AS OUR

69
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,783
>> HE DOESN’T VIEW THEM AS OUR FAMILY, HE VIEWS THEM AS OUR

70
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:56,183
FAMILY, HE VIEWS THEM AS OUR NEIGHBORS.

71
00:01:56,184 --> 00:00:00,000
NEIGHBORS. >> RIGHT, HE VIEWS THEM AS OUR
