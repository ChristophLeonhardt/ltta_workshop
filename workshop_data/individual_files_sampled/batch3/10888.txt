the doping scandal surrounding Team Russia has taken another twist just weeks before the Winter Olympics begin in South Korea Russian athletes will not be allowed to represent their country but can compete as neutrals however the International Olympic Committee still has to release an official list of competitors who will be allowed to compete at the games and it already looks bleak even for those athletes who've never tested positive for banned substances in their entire careers tensions in the sports world are hitting another high as the IOC has confirmed that the number of Russian athletes that are eligible to compete in the upcoming Winter Olympics is to be reduced now that has come unexpectedly and without explanation now the full list of who is eligible has not yet been released but the Russian Olympic Committee has disclosed a number of names that are thought to be who will be disqualified and that decision is ruffling feathers not only in Russia but abroad as well a french sports outlet has published a article online condemning the disqualification of two athletes in particular we will not be embarrassed to speak about a denial of justice supalen and still gov are banned from the Olympics because they participated in the Sochi games both have undergone hundreds of anti-doping controls since 2014 and dozens more in recent months controls carried out abroad controls carried out by independent bodies by federations and analyzed throughout Europe never in Russia the result over the last four years a biathlete has never tested positive Antonian is a biathlete who brought a gold home from Sochi and he and his teammates the FDA it was still Grove or leaders of Team Russia and were both two main hopefuls for winning medals in South Korea as well now they're both world champions and in all of their years competing neither has ever tested positive for doping and that's one of the reason the outlet sees the decision as an injustice the tone of this editorial will not please everyone that's obvious but there are still questions about the integrity of the decision makers since when can we condemn innocent sportsmen to punish the guilty is obvious to ban the Russians that doped also for the rest no the IOC has promised to publish the full list of eligible on Sunday just in our two weeks before the start of the games leaving an appeal unlikely and that means the number of Russian athletes who are still reeling from the fact that they will not be able to compete under their own flag will now be hit with another blow others said to be excluded from the list our prominent hockey players and figure skaters again all of whom have never tested positive for doping and yet they will now be forced to watch the games from the sidelines with 43 other other teammates who have been hit by bands earlier and another gold medalist who is also thought to be excluded is speed skater Viktor Ahn now he South Korean by birth which means that his dreams of competing in his home country are looking rather dim at this point and what condemnation of the decision has continued to flow in that's unlikely to change the IOC's mind well a number of international athletes as well as heads of Olympic Committee's have condemned the potential banning of clean up lights this is the head of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee saying that everyone who took illicit substances must be punished but that the measures taken against Russian athletes have been politically motivated meanwhile one French biathlete believes that the finger is being unfairly pointed at the whole country and the International biathlon Union head has claimed the organization has not been involved in the decision-making process well indeed Russian athletes from seven different disciplines are said to be missing from the list let's go through some it includes five prominent Russian short track speed skaters three biathlon champion and a two-time world champion cross country skier none have ever tested positive for doping a number of Russian ice hockey players stars as well baabs Lear's figure skaters bid didn't even compete at the Sochi 2015 games they're also missing however the IOC says it wanted to give way to a quote new clean generation the IOC wanted to give clean Russian athletes the opportunity to participate and give a young a new generation of clean Russian athletes the opportunity to be at the Olympic Games and be ambassadors for a new clean Russian sport well Ellis Cashmore a sociology professor at Austin University in the UK says aunty hysteria is ongoing and time is run out for the athletes to appeal the Olympic tournament itself is an invitation-only event and that means that the organisers have the power to exclude nations or individuals willy-nilly they can do it as they're pleased there is some kind of attempt to ostracize Russia Russia is the bad guy of sport at the moment has been for the past 12 or 18 months we know that it it isn't getting a fair shake we haven't seen evidence to support these allegations that there is state-sponsored doping but the world or most of the world at least seems to have accepted that there is some kind of systematic doping going on in Russia because of that reason I think that anyone who is associated with Russia is automatically lumped together with the nation that is collectively guilty of doping which is not to say of course that the rest of the world isn't taking dope too too hard to enhance their performances in sport because I think every other country is participating in some kind of doping but the point is that Russia has been stuck with that label and that stigma is going to be awfully difficult to erase in the years to come the closer it gets to the the start date it's a couple of weeks away now of course the more difficult it is to appeal this decision is going to be too late to go to the Court of Arbitration for sport it's unlikely to get a favorable decision from that court so in other words they've excluded them in the full knowledge that they won't be there in in career to compete
