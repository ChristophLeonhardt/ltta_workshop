1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,357
(electronic music)

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,340
It might look like we're
inside a spaceship,

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,956
but this is actually a farm.

4
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:11,789
(buzzing)

5
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:14,400
The crops here are
grown mostly by machines

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,490
with the help of just a few
humans, like this woman.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,370
Her life offers an early peek
at a new kind of farming.

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,216
It's a promising twist
to an ancient career,

9
00:00:25,216 --> 00:00:28,523
but only if the robots don't
replace her altogether.

10
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,071
(upbeat music)

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,450
As technology replaces old jobs,

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,870
it's also creating new ones.

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,640
I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,467
show you the jobs of the future.

15
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:45,050
(upbeat music)

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,570
My name is Katie Morich,
and I'm a vertical farmer.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,430
Katie works for a three year old

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,216
startup called Bowery.

19
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:02,570
(intercom buzzes)

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,377
Its farm is here, in this
industrial park in New Jersey.

21
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:07,400
How are you?

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,530
It's the last place you'd

23
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,553
expect to find any sign of life.

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,950
We take extra precaution
to make sure we're

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,490
not bringing any
contaminants into the farm,

26
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,430
so we're gonna wear
hairnets, and then this

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,823
is just gonna cover all
your street clothes.

28
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,842
Katie wears a clean uniform every day.

29
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:29,113
Visitors like me are handed
a non-negotiable jumpsuit.

30
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,623
Alright.

31
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,640
Step inside and you'll see a cross

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,673
between a factory and a lab.

33
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,769
(shimmering notes)

34
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,760
Trays of produce are vertically
stacked to save space,

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,714
and each of them is given
just the right amount of

36
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:54,360
light, water and nutrients at the

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,393
optimal temperature and humidity.

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,460
It's an incredible level of precision,

39
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,150
which is why Katie can
grow more faster with

40
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,482
less water and no pesticides.

41
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:07,530
(shimmering notes)

42
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,080
It's also what let's her grow things that

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,761
taste like nothing you've ever had before.

44
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:12,594
What's this?

45
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:14,314
This is the sorrel.

46
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:15,390
Mmm.

47
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,570
That tastes like candy apple.

48
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,732
Whoa!
That's good, right?

49
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:21,032
It's so sour.
I know.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,050
The majority of this
facility is automated.

51
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,967
(electronic notes)

52
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,590
The data is collected by sensors

53
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,280
and a computer controls growing
conditions for the crops.

54
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,730
For the things that the
machines can't do yet,

55
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,941
Katie and her fellow
human farmers fill in,

56
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:45,000
and even those tasks are dictated by

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,110
the software that runs
this whole operation.

58
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,810
It lets me know what I have to do,

59
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,241
what time I should be doing it by,

60
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:54,200
and that's how I get my day done.

61
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,790
Do you ever, like, rebel
against the computer's orders?

62
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,401
Uh, once in a while, if we're trying to do

63
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,910
a little experiment of
our own, we'll be like,

64
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,303
okay, is the system telling
us the correct things?

65
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:04,790
Most of the time it is.

66
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,173
All the time it's right. (laughs)

67
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,692
After a full day at the farm,

68
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:18,793
Katie likes to bring home
samples to her husband, Jase,

69
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:23,793
(blender whirrs)
and her cat, Burt.

70
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,410
(blender stops)

71
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,350
Salt, pepper?

72
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,570
Maybe a little more...
Garlic?

73
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,910
On the menu are two
items from Katie's farm.

74
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,603
Basil, for pesto pasta.

75
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:36,240
That's so good.

76
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,200
And mixed greens for a salad.

77
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,343
I'm terrified, everyone's judging.

78
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:41,863
Cheers, guys.

79
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:43,361
Cheers.
Cheers.

80
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:46,040
(bottles clink)

81
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,780
Katie fell in love with environmental

82
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,993
science in college, but after graduating

83
00:03:49,993 --> 00:03:53,253
she struggled to find a
full-time career in the field.

84
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,220
Jase had to deal with me a lot (laughs),

85
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,830
you know, coming home to me crying

86
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,263
and trying to figure out if
I'm making the right decisions.

87
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,253
And then, somehow,
online, Bowery popped up.

88
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,383
She told me about this
job, like, Bowery Farming,

89
00:04:14,383 --> 00:04:17,410
it's like an indoor, vertical
farm, and I was like,

90
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,000
alright, this sounds like total BS.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,780
So, I took my work truck
and I said, "You know,

92
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,970
let me swing around and see
what this is all about."

93
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,740
So I drove up to it,

94
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,830
doesn't look like there's
a farm in there at all.

95
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,460
So I called her and I was
like, "Listen, I know you're

96
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,397
psyched about this job, but
it seems super sketchy."

97
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,250
But I figured I'd go and
check it out for myself

98
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,060
and I pulled up and it was
exactly as how he described,

99
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,583
but I gave it a shot.

100
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,403
And so in 2017, Katie joined Bowery.

101
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,423
She became employee number nine.

102
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:54,800
(door shuts)

103
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,800
This is really my first real,
full-time, big-girl job.

104
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,500
(indistinct chatter)

105
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,650
And it was a little intimidating at first,

106
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,550
coming into this company
with people that have like,

107
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,798
their PHD and I don't
necessarily have that background,

108
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:13,190
so I constantly doubted myself when I

109
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,005
first started at Bowery.

110
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:18,457
I wasn't worried about
her at all, you know.

111
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:19,935
She said to us, "Can I do this?"

112
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:22,885
And I used to tell her to have
a little faith in herself.

113
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,300
Katie grew up in a
typical New Jersey suburb

114
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,963
with two working parents.

115
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,649
They've tried to stay away
from putting too much pressure

116
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:37,710
on their only child.

117
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,090
When we heard about what she was doing and

118
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,830
realized that this is
something that didn't exist

119
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,320
when we were younger and I
thought back from my generation,

120
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,290
you know, PC's came out
when I started working

121
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,950
and my parents probably
would've said I was crazy

122
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,910
if I went into an IT field at the time,

123
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,270
but now look what happened.

124
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,929
So, it's not a good idea
for us to try to tell her

125
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:03,783
what to do because it's a different world.

126
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:07,174
(beeping)

127
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,020
Bowery is backed by some of

128
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,470
Silicon Valley's top investors.

129
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,330
And with almost $30
million dollars of funding,

130
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,373
the startup is expanding fast.

131
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,130
And in May, after all that time
she spent doubting herself,

132
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,393
Katie got promoted to lead
a team of her own farmers.

133
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,970
The produce she grows supplies
a few nearby grocery stores

134
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,503
as well as this restaurant in Manhattan.

135
00:06:38,187 --> 00:06:39,020
(pan sizzles)

136
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,663
It's less than 10 miles
away from the Bowery farm.

137
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,204
What do you think?

138
00:06:49,204 --> 00:06:51,167
It's delicious! (both laugh)

139
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:52,890
You made that.

140
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,803
It's like, crazy to see
stuff I grew on a plate.

141
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,730
Alright, let me get some of...

142
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,910
But for Katie, it's not just about making

143
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,110
premium vegetables for
people who can afford them.

144
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,630
I want people to have the
purest produce imaginable,

145
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,173
and I want that to be
readily available to anybody.

146
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:13,049
(electronic music)

147
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,290
The world's population is set to reach

148
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,223
9.8 billion people by 2050.

149
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,993
Two-thirds will live in cities.

150
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,730
And we're gonna need all
kinds of new technology

151
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,463
to sustainably feed everyone.

152
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,730
The key to making that food affordable

153
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,663
is to continue to make
more with fewer farmers.

154
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,400
But no matter how high-tech all this gets,

155
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,850
Katie thinks there will
still be a place for her.

156
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:43,677
I just think there's something about the

157
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:45,640
human mind that you
can't really replicate.

158
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,230
So I think we could still
work closely with technology,

159
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,290
but I still think it's
nice to have a human there.

160
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,920
It'll also be pretty lonely for the robots

161
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,523
if they don't have anybody
to talk to. (laughs)

162
00:07:58,470 --> 00:00:00,000
(beeping)
