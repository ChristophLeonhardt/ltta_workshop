1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,750
Andrew Gillum’s surprise
win in the primary race

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,110
for Florida’s governor

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,380
is the latest in a series 
of breakthrough victories

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,210
for black Democratic
candidates,

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,730
which also includes 
Ben Jealous of Maryland

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,790
and Stacey Abrams of Georgia.

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,450
Gillum, the mayor
of Tallahassee,

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,284
played unapologetically
to the progressive left.

9
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,950
“How about running for
governor and being

10
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,040
the most progressive Democrat,
who would invest a billion dollars

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,770
in education, and create
Medicare for all?”

12
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,770
His strategy?

13
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,500
Appeal to voters
who have historically

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,700
skipped the midterms,

15
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,070
like young people
and minority voters.

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,500
And get them
to the polls.

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,610
“In order for a candidate
like me to win,

18
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,080
I’ve got to be
able to turn out

19
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,670
those voters who
are highly skeptical

20
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,170
of the political process.”

21
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,270
Stacey Abrams, Georgia’s 
Democratic nominee for governor,

22
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,940
is making a similar bet.

23
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,514
“My approach is, every
Democratic voter we can get,

24
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,820
especially those who
don’t think their voices matter,

25
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,544
and independent thinkers
who realize they are

26
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:52,810
heading down the wrong path

27
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,511
if they don’t vote
for a Democrat this time.

28
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,960
And there are enough 
of us to win an election.”

29
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,710
Both Gillum and Abrams

30
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,550
are running against
Trump-style conservatives.

31
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,530
Ron DeSantis in Florida.

32
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,500
“Ron loves playing with the kids.”

33
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,760
“Build the wall!”

34
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,610
And Brian Kemp in Georgia.

35
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,910
“I got a big truck, just
in case I need to round up

36
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,670
criminal illegals and take
them home myself.”

37
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,750
In Maryland, Ben Jealous,

38
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,140
former president of the N.A.A.C.P.,

39
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,150
beat out a crowded
field of candidates

40
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,940
to win the Democratic
nomination for governor.

41
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,010
Jealous faces long
odds to unseat

42
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,910
Larry Hogan, a popular
Republican incumbent,

43
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,640
but believes he has
a shot at turning out

44
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,440
enough left-leaning 
voters to win.

45
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,130
“Larry Hogan’s go-along
to get-along politics,

46
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,980
and his policies on
almost every issue,

47
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,180
stand in direct contrast

48
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,550
to those I laid out 
in this campaign.”

49
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,500
All three candidates
have also benefited

50
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,360
from the endorsement
of Vermont senator

51
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,020
and progressive standard-bearer

52
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,210
Bernie Sanders.

53
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,240
“We are going to elect this man

54
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,840
as the next governor
of this state.”

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
If they win,

56
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,340
Gillum and Jealous will be
the first black governors

57
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,420
in their states.

58
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,150
And Abrams, the first
black female governor

59
00:02:03,150 --> 00:00:00,000
in the nation.
