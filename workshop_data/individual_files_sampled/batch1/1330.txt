thousands of white workers staged a strike in South Africa the angry their employer is giving company shares exclusively to blacks they say that's racist discriminatory and unfair but what constitutes fairness in the post apartheid era this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I am Hashim Alberta for the first time in South Africa's history thousands of white union workers have staged a strike they're furious their employer one of the country's leading energy companies has introduced a new share scheme which is only available to black workers white workers say that's discriminatory and racially divisive but their bosses at sessle's say the moves been backed by shareholders and meets rules designed for black economic empowerment part of a drive to reverse decades of exclusion for blacks and apartheid the company wouldn't give us an interview but on its website says it remains committed to engaging with all trade union partners to our guests in a moment but first fabula Miller reports from secondo the new share scheme is infuriating sessle's white employees because it only benefits their black colleagues they don't say we judge you on your contribution of your skin these workers say they're being discriminated against Brian Fulton who's worked at Sasol for 30 years agrees we bought this company working shift works and doing night shift and 16-hour shifts you know and I think it's unfair that's what people to be disputed from from sources banners in Afrikaans read skin colour does not determine my worth but under apartheid skin colour did exactly that for decades excluding non-white workers from most jobs sasso says it's new chase game is not about workers benefits or pay it's about empowering black workers through a che scheme that would allow them 25% ownership but white workers here say the company is being racist and they want equality critics say that since 1995 only an elite group of blacks have benefited from economic empowerment the World Bank says South Africa is one of the most unequal countries in the world with poverty persistently high among black South Africans the trade union federation Cassata says it will fight any resistance to transforming the economy wake up a quarter of a century later and have these very same people we previously beneficiaries of the preservation aims there me lamenting about a policy that is trying to redress the imbalance of the past it's beyond mischievious and we think an organization like solidarity is ready showing its true colors leaders of the Solidarity trade union say the share scheme will only worsen divisions between workers and the union says if Sasol executives don't change their minds complaints will be made to South Africa's Human Rights Commission and the United Nations femida mela al jazeera Secunda south africa let's bring in our panel joining us in Johannesburg Dirk Herman who you just saw in the piece he is the CEO of the Solidarity trade union and from Cape Town via Skype Ralph Madiga lecturer at the University of Western Cape and author of llama poses turn can Cyril save South Africa also in Johannesburg Denis George general secretary of the Federation of unions of South Africa welcome to old mr. Herman what's wrong with satchels share scheme that has prompted your anger and the shutdown sassily the previous scheme in zalo in in Zola actually included all workers that scheme went underwater and then they created a new scheme and this schemes name is tanisha and can Lisa suddenly exclude the white workers so we sit here with a past of inclusion and then the future of exclusion and that frustrates the word workers that to frustrate them so that 89% of them voted in favor of a strike action they said well enough is enough we want our voice to be heard and then they come here out in the masses striking and sight to the world this is how we feel this is our frustrations the positive of this of course is that we are a democracy in making so this is bringing balance again in the debate suddenly we talk again because what we say is absolute exclusion simply on the base of the race can neither be the future of South Africa you've heard mr. Herman talking about the reason that prompted his trade union to start the strike solidarity insists the attempt to introduce the new share scheme is in violation of the mine charters that insist white workers should also be included in share skins yeah look let me state a few basics about what I think is happening it's a song and solidarity Spurs we need to be quite clear this is an affirmative action skin that you can generally characterized as a measure aimed at advancing the previously disadvantaged groups and from where solidarity step it does make sense that solidarity is actually raising questions by saying that suppose practice amount to unfair discrimination because it creates absolute exclusion of the wide from benefiting from this scheme and I believe from my reading here that solidarity is actually standing also not just on the mining charter but I think that they will have to stand also on the basis of section 9 of the Constitution the right to equality which says that no one can be unfairly discriminated against equally the very same section of equality in our Constitution which is section 9 also provide explicitly that measures may be taken by government to advance those who have been historically disadvantaged with the aim to actually bring them to a place where they can enjoy the right to equality so all of these are provided for in the Constitution what I think needs to be done on what I think is at the center of this it is actually the balance and the extent to which the measure that have been taken by us all actually violates the right of those who are being excluded a question it could be asked as to whether are there other means that have been attempted I see a bring about these policy goals before this measure can actually be undertaken that is the balance that need to be retained I will come back as to okay do I think about the decision will go into detail much throughout the show let me now include Dennis George mr. George you represent another trade union which is the federation of unions of south africa how do you see the share scheme yeah look from our point of view our Constitution is quite clear that the rights can be limited from certain groups who have benefited in a pass through job reservations to different kinds of advancement by the state which I of course are Africa to be one of the most unequal societies in the world we also find today that many of black people you know stole find himself in questioning the situation that's the reason why we support the measures that Assessor is taking to empower black workers and more companies should do so in the future because workers that have benefited in a path to discrimination against black people want now to shout the same language that they must benefit again and by that manner we never gonna address the inequalities in our country and for us the situation that's actually taking its correct measure and for us we believe that the situation of solidarity is totally on top out of order and out of wisdom mm-hmm mr. Herman I mean the counter argument to what you have been saying earlier is basically what the government or what's acid is trying to do is reverse a situation that has been prevailing for decades white workers benefited from the system in the 60s and the 70s millions of Africans suffered under apartheid it's about high time to address that situation yet you seem to be upset that's not in question yeah the fact of the matter is South Africa's imbalances because of the past pass that excluded the specific group of workers and that must be addressed and South Africa have several instruments in place to address that like for instance and affirmative action program that helps with promotions and also then appointments in the workplace it's also has a very aggressive affirmative action program and that brought about a lot of equality in the workplace and transformation within the workplace but this goes too far but because this is about share ownership and suddenly you say to a specific group of workers and this place your white working-class people if people in blue overalls that's not rich people that's not people in management expects actions and etc and you say to them you can't be part of the ownership of this and they were never part of ownership scheme at all in their lives what we said now in solidus stage we set with a share ownership scheme of top execs yesterday 106 million grant worth of share value options is awarded to the 15 top people in ansel and the interesting fact is and that is inclusive of all Rice's nobody is arguing that they exclude the white workers then they bring in the black workers as well as part of owners the only group in the whole of sussel it is the blue collar white workers are not part of subtle and that goes too far and that is what led to her feelings of alienation feeling that we are not owners and feelings of frustration Matenga interesting times in South Africa the outcry over the issue of the share ownership and also the debate which is ongoing about the land reform and the expropriation there has been advanced by the and see is this interconnected I do believe there are links because at the center of this I mean as a scholar where stand is that you cannot apply policy arbitrarily you cannot just apply policy on the basis that it satisfies the majority of course the essence of policy should be to satisfy the majority but we cannot arbitrarily actually violate the right of the minorities and the police implementation environment in South Africa is such that there are so much tensions within the policy that there seems to be an idea of majoritarianism and I think there is no willingness where stand to actually justify some of the policy prerogatives and I have to say that I mean I've looked at many of these cases involving affirmative action many of these cases such as the one in Seoul there was another interesting case in the past where government had actually shaped a pension scheme on the basis of race as well involving members of parliament in all these cases the biggest problem is that South Africa is not willing to have a conversation on affirmative action the problem is that you have two extremes there are those who are saying we must get rid of affirmative action and those who are saying that you must apply it we thought were being worried about how it affect the minorities so this does not work in there this principle and the spirit of the Constitution that we have government has to justify his policy and I have to say here after looking at many cases this is the first case that I'm seeing where actually a trade union before they go to court because most of these cases end up with affirmative action measures being challenged in court and I have to say 80% of the time government affirmative action programs fail in court because not because affirmative action is bad because they are poorly formulated because there is no concern on those policies mister mr. George I would like to ask you a question about whether the debater we see now in South Africa sheds light about the problems that the country faces particularly when it comes to the black economic empowerment what do you think should be done now by the government to trying to sort out these problems yeah you see this pin from the beginning after we have negotiated this agreement and legislation in net-like there has been massive resistance specifically in the private sector of not implementing the Employment Equity targets we've also seen that many excuses are finding and that is the reason why the trade unions in Annette like specifically producer we believe it is important that we need to get over this particular matter and that we must implement the Employment Equity legislation and the black economic empowerment because we per person look at the situation of black people in South Africa then we will also see that they are the most disadvantaged people in this country and it is very important for us to implement these legislations and to make sure that we address the massive issue of inequality in the country mm-hmm mr. Herman workers are workers in every company all over the world but we're talking about one of the most unequal societies in the world South Africa and you know that there is this need to try to redress a situation and particularly the wealth imbalance in South Africa so if you're not happy with the share ownership what do you think should be the option to try to solve this problem workers are workers you are quite correct about that in the inequalities in South Africa is not between the workers in South Africa in fact is the workers on ground floor level are equal people working with good good relationships and what happens here is the moment that you divide the workers that actually are equal as workers on bites of rice then you create new forms of tension you don't address inequalities by dividing the workers and this issue is actually resolved in humanity in the beginning in the draft mining charter of South Africa and the draft mining charter we had long long long discussions and on how to deal with this issue and the resolution was of all role players as other trade unions and that was government that was big business etc was that if it comes to share ownership scheme if it's about ownership then all workers must be included because workers are workers if you want to try to address inequality since South Africa then you must empower all workers then that will help but it doesn't help to create in inequalities between workers in South Africa because this is what's happening here we don't talk about the topics X and the y T Lydia we stand up for orderly blue collar workers Madiga the the need to address the disparities the imbalances the racial injustice in South Africa has been Cardinal for the ANC and particularly when it took power in 1994 but he said that it has failed to deliver all the promises that he has been making for quite some time is it possible that the ANC now and the South Africa and the Cyril Ramaphosa would be able to solve this social economic problems I don't believe the potential to solve the economic problems that we have in inequality deep inequalities I think that we will not achieve much if we throw ultimatums at each other and I'm talking about policy at we cannot go it is it up my way or the highway and those who are resisting some of the policies that are based on social justice also need to understand that it is an untenable for them to enjoy life in a society that is a very unequal mr. George I just like to include Jo's of this particular issue which is the black economic empowerment has been going on for quite some time but many say that it has benefited only a few portion of the affected society well what is the problem here is an issue of bureaucracy corruption or inefficiency from the from the part of the government yeah look the whole situation is this you must now understand that the total economy in South Africa before 1994 was totally controlled by the white people in South Africa and what the state is trying to do is through the procurement instruments is to procure from black people to make sure that we make black people part of the mainstream economy of the country I mean my father and I grew up under apartheid you know we could have brought somebody from Scotland or from Portugal and that person would have been allowed to open up a business in Cape Town in the main street of earthly street but when a black person wanted to open up a business the legislation in this country prohibited a full person myself who was never allowed to apply for any specific job because in the advertisement it specifically told you that job is for white people only and you're not even allowed to apply for a position and today when the democratically elected government won to affirm black people then you get lots of academics and people like mr. chairman that want to stand on the rooftops and want to shout it is unfair but unfortunately for them the constitution of the republic of africa makes provision for the empowerment and for positive discrimination in order to address the injustice of the past mr. Herman I mean in theory if you look at the whole rationale behind the share ownership land redistribution it basically says that if companies meet government quotas on black ownership if we can redistribute land to the poor that could boost the economy the same way it did for countries like Japan and South Africa and South and South Korea back in the 80s and the 70s so why wouldn't we implement the same model for a country like South Africa we are quite positive about the idea of empowering workers we are also positive about the idea of empowering black workers and to give them shades within the company we just can't understand why in that same logic you must say that white workers must be excluded to empower and include black workers are offset in the beginning a very important word and he used the word word balance and that is what we must seek in South Africa if you listen at everything the dana set of exclusion of a previous system then the answer for the new system is not exclusion again the fact of the matter is we must have new hands and approaches and if we look at the Constitution that you also referred to the Constitution make it also very clear through the words of the Human Rights Commission South Africa that equality can't be a race only system the Human Rights Commission of South Africa said just last weekend report what we need is a new hands approach we need to be context sensitive and we must not use race as an only criteria and the Human Rights Commission criticized the current race classification that is used in South Africa and whatsis all year is do do is absolutely right the pendulum swung too far in the social example and the protests of solidarity bring about balance back into the parameters of the Constitution ok mr. Motta gur how much of this whole debate about the the share scheme and also land redistribution is genuine how much of is politically motivated because on the other end of the debate you have people saying that Cyril Ramaphosa is using the issue to try to prevent his rival breakaway group the economic freedom fighters from winning the elections in the next year I think that this issues need to be thought about beyond the attention of the elections the elections the purity leading to the election do not really make a good environment for discussion of issues such as this which are a very very delicate and I do think that mr. Ramos's leadership you need to be thinking in a long term as to how do you actually consult with different groups in society when it comes to policy I'm okay I I fully understand where my two colleagues come from I do think however that the most important thing in South Africa is actually to reinstate the importance of conversation as a process of policymaking okay George so just do you think that amending the section 25 of the Constitution to pave the way for the expropriation of the land without compensation as has been now suggested by Cyril Ramaphosa could be the best option to try to sort out some of the simmering discontent in South Africa yeah look the situation is Parliament is currently with a committee busy with consulting barriers they go this out to address the situation and I think there's some come consensus emerging that it's not only just the amendment of the Constitution but it's also about practical measures our black emerging farmers should be supported and I must say that we are very encouraged by Agri South Africa that I've put forward you know proposals and also a split with government to put funding on the table so what we want to see is a much more stronger agricultural sector that can contribute towards the economy but also to ensure that more black people are part of the agricultural sector in South Africa and all that note we'll have to wrap up our show Denis George Ralph Mateo Herman thank you very much indeed for being present on the program today and thank you too for watching you can see the program again any time by visiting our website aljazeera.com for further discussion go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ Inside Story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at aj inside story from me Hashima Hubbell and the whole team here bye for now
