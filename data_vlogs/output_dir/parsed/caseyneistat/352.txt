it's what about 25 minutes into the
shower still sweating for my run this
morning I love the summer heat
two backpacks a boosted board a camera
and a smoothie I got this it's a lot of
stuff to carry I'm like a Porter mule
ooh nice Tesla
nice Tesla
okay so I have a podcast about New
Yorkers no way
it's a Casey Stamp dude Johnny I would
love I would love to be on your podcast
thank you for this case you stamp I'd
like to start off this Monday morning by
showing you the progress we've made over
in the new space I wanna do both
production and an illustrative working
here so I had to start with the disc
brakes out the space-like and then I'm
not exactly sure how this movie laid out
yet but just feel living and working in
New York City just how to really be
efficient in small spaces most important
about dates air conditioner in video
camera news I'm going to be switching
from the Canon 70d that's what I'm
shooting on here I'm gonna switch to an
ADB ready
that's the EDD you tell the difference
no probably not the battery keeps
falling out the trouble with these is
when this door accidentally opens it
cancels the shot whatever I get new gear
people always comment hey can I have
your old camera just because it's a
little broken doesn't mean I don't use
it I often need more than one camera and
I don't want to give this thing away
I think it's raining how's that possible
it's raining out I came down here for
well brought the drone down here been a
lot of comments lately saying why aren't
I using the drone
I love the drone I just keep forgetting
it and my often oh you got to be kidding
me I can fix this but I crapped the
glass and the lens of my drone he's yet
but I'm pretty sure you can fly these
things in the rain so I'm still gonna
send it up rain or shine
I don't think I could have picked a
worse time to fly the drone there's like
a crazy thunderstorm happening right now
it's raining on the lens of the drone I
have time trying to get it back to the
way that oh my god is starting to pour
outside
soaking wet everything's wet
going
wow this is a storm
I live that thing in the nick of time my
god it's a distant distant
wow this comes from that
it's so powerful I'm not kidding holy
 yeah look at this look at the water
I picked the worst days to go out like a
white squall or something I don't know
what to do I got all my stuff out here
no I'm not kidding I'm not making this
up I'm not powering the boosted board
right now this is the wind pushing me
let's never storms like this and the sea
was sunny out like ten minutes ago what
do I even take cover come out of nowhere
whoa no problem man it's done
whoa weird this door come from nowhere
out of nowhere Chile
I'm now in a fairly shady bathroom here
glorious I try to stay dry stop
recording here this is a vector
pardon the interruption it appears the
microphone here shorted out at some
point in time during the monsoon the
rest of this scene is going to have
subtitles
now before that whole type wouldn't
happen
I mentioned needing to figure out a
longer-term solution for the mail time
situation I need to figure out what to
do with all the mail time packages that
come I need a system for all that stuff
it's completely out of control
every letter that people send me a
catalog I save as you can see this is
not sustainable so I need to come up
with a longer term solution for what to
do all this great stuff that people send
me thanks for the shoes Nike so here's
what I'm thinking why don't I just give
away everyday or something like that the
stuff that companies send me then I
don't know what to do it like dear Casey
we have Brackett trot and really like
watching your videos or uh
we thought you'd find some uses for our
adventure gear okay look at all this
great stuff
they're like iPhone holder is a GoPro
attachments really nice them to send me
this stuff I don't know what to do with
this I don't need all this stuff
scooter somebody's sending so I'll start
there if you want this scooter just like
just like a hashtag yo Casey let me get
that dang scooter something like that
and we'll pick somebody and send it to
you you have to be a subscriber all
giveaways in this channel or for
subscribers only okay now I'm gonna see
what kind of damage was done to all my
gear in that storm thanks for watching I
think I fried this camera look I'm not
touching any buttons
I'm not touching the camera at all the
menus going eight
