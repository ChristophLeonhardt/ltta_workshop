Germany's President Frank Walter Steinmeier says his country is facing a situation not seen in 70 years Merkel's parties at a crossroads after negotiations to form a coalition government failed Stein Meyers urged all sides to form a coalition and not let down voters who cast their ballots in September's election we are now confronted by a situation that's not existed in the history of the German Federal Republic for 70 years this is a moment when all sides need to take stock and reconsider their conduct all parties elected to the Bundestag have a shared duty to serve their country I expect from all parties a willingness to make possible the formation of a government in the foreseeable future those who seek democratically given responsibility mustn't shirk away when they hold it in their hands a German president made his statement following the failure of coalition talks between Angela Merkel's CDU party and the Free Democrats the Free Democrats walked out of the talks because of opposing views on several key issues one stumbling block is the migrant issue in particular whether to limit the number of asylum seekers and whether to allow their family members to reunite with them artis Peter Oliver has more on the unfolding crisis well the reason that those coalition talks broke down was because Christian Lindner the head of the free Democratic Party pro-business liberal party here in Germany he walked out of those talks he did also give a statement on Monday saying that as he'd done that it wasn't a decision he made lightly but as we can hear from him just after he walked out of those talks Serna doesn't seem like he was coming to an agreement with anybody in that room anytime soon the event ones we will not abandon all voters for a policy with which we are not convinced it is better not to govern than to govern badly well the Green Party for their side who were also part of they said negotiation it was going on they've said that at the time the Free Democrats walked out they were close to a deal that in their words would have been an improvement for Refugees and say that didn't only didn't get signed because the free democrats walked out but what about the other big player in german politics the social democrats there was a chance they could come back in form a coalition with Angela Merkel as they had done before the the election and everything would be fine well their leader and former European Parliament president Martin Schulz has spoken to the cameras he said there will be no grand coalition as it's known with Angela Merkel he did say that if there were fresh elections that he would consider running again against Angela Merkel and in terms of the options that were available one option apart from fresh elections is a minority government with Angela Merkel as its head he said that simply wasn't the right move for Germany considering how weak it would make the government and what role Germany has to play on the world stage so where does this leave us either a coalition deal gets done a minority government is allowed to rule the Bundestag or we all call back for new elections that would probably take place early next year or in the spring at the latest are someone who might be able to shed more light on the situation now is mr. Frank will be a senior FDP party member and former ambassador thank you for joining us on the program sir now the president is calling for fresh negotiations how likely is it that they will lead to anything new do you think well it's a present I think that the coalition talks aiming at a Jamaica coalition's have definitely failed that does not exclude negotiations with all responsible parties concerned to consider some sort of core cooperation either by tolerating a minority government or by even forming some sort of coalition government that might eventually work mr. Albee why did your party walk out of negotiations what were the main sticking points there well my party has right from the beginning said that we are guided by principles we have been elected because we committed to modernize the country we entered into these negotiations with good faith and things went well in the first phase of the coalition talks we then run into difficulties and the main obstacle was caused by the Greens who unfortunately introduced decade old conflict between reales and funfun days into the talks and it was this conflict between the Greens themselves that never allowed for a meaning to achieve a meaningful result I think that was a main stumbling block and there was one point when we realized that the chances to have a Jamaica coalition would not really stand a fair chance anymore but then something happened in the last night that relate to the problem of the soli which is a special tax that was introduced in Germany after reunification and which means that all German taxpayers have to pay a certain amount of money for the reconstruction of the former GDR now the three Democrats wanted to abandon this tax and there was a stumbling block all of a sudden established and against promises that we had had from the CDU before this was no longer an option for us and I think that cost some anger in the last minute of negotiations well the Greens have said they're more than ready to negotiate they're eager in fact do you think your party the FDP might change its tune the point is when the green say that there are eager to act they would have to prove it they are split on the issue do you think that a minority I thought it would be my party would actually I'm not speaking for the party I'm just no senior member my party I think would be willing to resume talks if there is a meaningful outcome do you think that a minority government could be on the cards now and if so what would that mean for Chancellor Merkel well you know it depends if Chancellor Merkel would still be the candidate for the chancellorship it is the president who is according to our Constitution the person to suggest a candidate now this is cannot be taken for granted that it will be mrs. Merkel I understand that there is a strong opposition in our own party against being nominated if the coalition with the Jamaica partners would fail we've spoken to a few analysts throughout the day who've said that this could be the beginning of the end for Angela Merkel and her party is that a view that you share oh yes indeed and how likely is it you think that there'll be snap elections out in Germany that is a matter for the president to decide if new chancellor would be elected even as a head of a minority a government which would be possible in the third phase of the elections where the relative majority would be enough it's still his decision whether he is wishing to tolerate a minority government or whether he call snap elections if this son is as you think it could be the end of Merkel Merkel's party and her time as the Chancellor how do you see her future I must tell you I've never really thought about it okay let's turn to Martin Schulz shall we the SDP is Martin Schulz he's ruled out forming a coalition why do you think he's done that well you know I think that the Social Democrats have virtually suffered a lot in two grand coalition that they have been going through with the Christian Democrats and they didn't gain anything from being in a great coalition therefore I think it is the bitter experience that they have made an experience which was also shared as a coalition partner when the for the Free Democrats until 2013 I think it is this bitter experience that has prompted such a reaction not to be enthusiastic about one more it would have been the third round of grand coalition and I tell you quite frankly I think that the grand coalition is perverting democracy do you think that later this week we'll see and all parties return to the negotiating table yes or no well I think it will not necessarily be a return to a negotiating table but they have their own channels to communicate with each other and to investigate if they are proper means to return to a negotiating table in the final analysis for the time being I don't think that the same people will meet again within the next few days mr. Frank Elbe senior FDB party member and former ambassador thank you for sharing your thoughts and shedding some light on the situation there enjoy thank you
