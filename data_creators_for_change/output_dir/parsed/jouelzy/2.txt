-  Hey Guys!
Hopefully I'm not too orange.
I have orange curtains, but I'm probably
going to have to swap them out.
But I wanted to come and have
a quick discussion with you guys
about the midterm elections and
how to look forward, how I feel after
all the shenanigans and
the BS... Girl! (hmmph)
About that, so in 2016 when the whites
elected an orange popsicle
to the presidency,
I was clearly distraught and upset
and I did upload a video with
a very raw, emotions and feelings
towards what this, I'm remissed
to call him a president
what, the popsicle
Mussolini was going to mean
to us and our wellbeing, and I mean,
it is still a stressful
scenario, you know?
I think a lot of us, maybe
we just took for granted
that the Obama era did give
a lot of people a lot of hope
and a lot of, you know, a lot
of us became entrepreneurs,
a lot of us persuade businesses,
a lot of us just did things
because we felt like we could conquer
and I get that this is not new,
this is America at its core, I get that.
I just didn't necessarily want
to live through it at
this height, you know?
Like, it still doesn't feel good.
I wanted to come and talk
about the midterm elections
because I know that they
might not feel good either
because Beto O'Rourke didn't win
and we have contested elections in both
Georgia, with Stacey Abrams, and
then Florida, with Andrew Gillum,
and they have become some of the most
notable candidates running for office and
I have been consistent in saying
that local elections matter.
I have been very consistent
with that messaging.
This essentially was a local election
that got a lot of visibility
in the mainstream media.
Okay. So, for one, I just recently moved
from Dallas, Texas to
Charlotte, North Carolina.
I got to meet Beto
O'Rourke sometime around,
I feel like late 2016 or early 2017
because I was going to
Dallas Democrat meetings.
I was actually going to
Dallas Young Democrat meetings
and I was trying to find
a way to get more involved
in like, the political activism in Dallas
which, um, (clears throat) yeah, (grunts)
I ended up being very disheartened with
the state of the Democrats in Dallas
and so I started digging into the history
of like what is going on here because
the Democrat party in
Dallas is very old, white,
and I was like, you know there's
diversity here, why aren't there more,
particularly Latinos, where
are the black people at?
Like, I just didn't feel
like the constituency
of Dallas was really represented
in the Democrat meeting.
And, like, certain things that they did
just didn't make it very welcoming
or, like, something that you would want
to be a part of or invest time in.
And so, when I started to dig into it,
I was digging into the
political history of Texas
and realizing that, and
I've said this before,
even though Dallas and Houston and Austin
are considered blue dots in
a very red state, they are
actually homes to much of
the conservative movement
and the GOP and the
Republicans, over the years,
once they realized that they could not win
the presidency consistently,
you know there was
always gonna be this back and forth,
they switched their
energy in realizing that
they could never win the popular vote
for the presidency, but
that they would dismantle
a lot of federal regulations, by
controlling state and local governments
and therefore, essentially
dismantling the Democrat party.
Now, I know that there has
been this bubbling over
this conversation about not voting and
just not persuading the system
because a lot of us are frustrated
with this idea of only having
a two party system, but again
I always say this. Nothing
happens in a vacuum.
There is this large web of movement,
of pieces of a system that is built
to make sure that
capitalism and imperialism
always benefits the wealthy, but
if it's a small class of people.
Any sort of movement that we have had
towards civil rights towards opening up
the access and the equity towards,
largely via the government
during the Obama era,
was largely undone in
elements of government
that we as the public were
not paying attention to
because we came out and voted in 2008
and we elected a black man and
the Republicans went
into overdrive, right?
And a lot of us were just so happy
that black man got into office.
We thought that was gonna be the peak,
we thought it was gonna be great,
that we didn't pay attention to what
was happening on the
judiciary side of things, um
particularly within the supreme court,
with Citizens United, and I believe
it was another ruling with FEC,
I'm sorry if I'm talking so fast.
But, if you're wondering how I
even gather a lot of this information,
one of my favorite podcasts, and
I mention it often and people always like
"what's the name of the
podcast?" Girl! More Perfect.
More Perfect is actually
the name of the podcast
and I believe in season
two when they cover
Citizens United, is
there another FEC ruling?
I feel like (hmm) if there isn't,
it's all kind of covered in that episode
where they talk about
why that ruling mattered
and how it has an impact on our elections
and Texas is largely ground zero
for how Republicans went about
focusing on local and state elections
and how well they have been able to undo
the Democrat establishment
in the state of Texas
and that I can move to Texas
and try to get involved
as a younger person and just be entirely
turned off 'cause I'm
like what are y'all doing?
It just is very difficult. Now,
part of that is Texas has some
of the hardest voter
registration laws in the country.
It gets really murky because Texas,
being the ground zero for these
conservative movements and they're
not out somewhere in Jasper, Texas.
Like, these conservative
people are in Houston,
they're in Dallas and
they're in Austin. Right?
So, you have people like Crystal Mason
who went and filed a provisional vote
because her mother encouraged
her to go vote in the
presidential election
and she's like, "are you
sure? I just got out of jail".
So when she went to go vote and
she acknowledged that she wasn't
sure if she could vote or not,
she filled out a provisional ballot,
which basically means, until your vote
is verified as being valid,
your vote will not be counted.
She signed it and so technically
the caught her for voter fraud
and sent her to five years in
prison for mistakenly voting.
Now, another person in, I believe, in the
neighboring county,
probably somewhere in Plano,
is that still Tarrant or
is that Dallas County?
Another woman who had voted twice
as a Republican, got
probation for voter fraud.
We have to acknowledge what
Beto O'Rourke was overcoming.
Not only that, the biggest point is
Texas has one of the lowest turn out rates
for elections in the
country, hovering around 6%.
Ted Cruz's last election, he won
by like a 1.5 million margin,
so for Beto to lose by 200,000 votes
in a state where technically he
could not go register voters,
they can't run a campaign
to register voters, right?
It's very difficult, there's a lot of laws
around who can register, how to register,
like you can't even drive
people to the polls.
It's like, it's difficult, right?
For the spirit of his campaign,
to help motivate people on the ground,
not only to go vote, but
the amount of volunteers
and organizations that got
invested in Texas politics,
and to lose by that small of a margin,
without the support of superPACs,
like this was all money
donated from individuals.
That is a very huge deal in a state
that has been ground
zero for the Republicans'
strategy around local and state elections.
His campaign and this election cycle
did come with some smaller
victories down ballot,
in that down ballot politicians,
as in Colin Allred, who
ran for U.S. Congress,
against Pete Sessions, was able to
flip that seat in a
very Republican county.
Uh, we have the magistrate in Houston,
which is basically like the executive
who oversees the judges and someone
who was on track to
potentially run for governor,
lost his seat to a 27 year old.
Lina, fuck it up sis. Fuck it up!
I'm here for it. A 27
year old Hispanic woman.
Yas sis, eff it up for 'em. Be ethical.
We gone keep you on your nose.
We gone follow you. We
gone hold you accountable,
but sis, eff it up for them, alright?
Texas has a state
legislature that's basically
set up to ensure that even if you run,
and possibly win, it is very difficult
for you to hold that seat because
the state legislature meets for
five months out of the year, so
for five months out of the year,
you have to move to Austin for five months
and sit in the legislature
and then the governor
can call this legislature
whenever he wants.
So, even though they
meet from January to May,
if the governor decides, "oh, y'all aint
do something the way I like,
I wanna call y'all back,"
at any time he could call congress up
and y'all gotta come sit for a week.
So, basically you just
need to have a house,
a room, or a home. You
know for a lot of people,
economically, putting
yourself in this position
because you cannot take campaign monies
to fund yourself is very difficult.
That's why you will see
in Texas local elections,
particularly it's a lot of older,
even when it is black, they old,
they wealthy, and they out of touch.
We needa get the railroad
commissioner out of here.
That's the real gag in Texas.
That's tied to oil
and all the other stuff
and that's why can't get Amtrak
in the damn state anyways.
We're going off topic though, here.
But, what I wanna say to take
away from the Beto campaign
is that, like, to lose
by that small of a margin
is historic in its own right.
Like, Texas elections for Republicans are
won in margins of 2 million. Now, I see
a lot of people campaigning that
suggesting that he should
run for president in 2020
and I think that's interesting because
there is another senate election.
I don't think he has a chance
in Hell of beating John Cornyn, ooh girl.
That would be just such
an expensive election,
that I get why I'm seeing people say
he should run for
president because by time
we put all that money into
an election against Cornyn,
you might as well just run
for the presidency anyway,
but I really wish we could
get these Republicans
out of here and a lot
of that comes down to
registering for people to vote
and now that organizations and volunteers
have been motivated on the ground
because of Beto election, I think
we need to keep up that pace and
keep up participating, or volunteering
and knocking on doors and making calls
and helping people understand their rights
as citizens of this country and
getting people registered to vote.
And I think I was,
earlier, making this point
about the two party system,
its a function of capitalism.
It is very difficult to run
outside of the two parties
because part of how
you finance a campaign.
So, one of the other benefits
of Beto and his notoriety
was a lot of that money
helped down ballot politicians
in that a lot of smaller politicians
who might not get the sort of
mainstream visibility, it's been notable
for plenty of the bigger
politicians who run,
particularly Hilary Clinton,
both Abrams and Gillum
and Beto, that they have used
some of their monies to help finance
smaller campaigns for like school boards,
for state senate, state congress.
All these sort of movements help
members of those
communities be able to vie
to run for office and its not just about
individuals running for office,
it is that your are represented,
that your community and your
concerns are represented
because a lot of what
happens in the government,
focuses, there is no way to check out
from the United States
government and not be impacted.
You might think you gone
stop paying taxes, cool sis,
but the way you access healthcare,
obviously, when you
wanna buy a plane ticket
and why ticket costs, why it costs
so doggone much to fly
from Charlotte to Atlanta
like, basic stuff. Your ability
to get on the train and go some place.
How much you pay for your car.
The gas you put in your car.
The things you see on TV.
Your ability to log onto
the internet, the government
has a function in all of that.
So, it just behooves you to be
invested in not only voting,
but keeping your politicians accountable.
With Gillum and Abrams,
going into a recount,
I believe Abrams will
likely go into a re vote.
You just have to
understand, along with Beto,
these are now, you're
talking about black people
running for governor,
in southern states where
Texas might be ground zero, but Georgia
and Florida are right behind them, right?
In that the, you have Stacy Abrams
running against the man
who controls the elections.
Sis! Most of us would never even
put up that sort of fight and that
not only is she putting up the fight,
and I had the chance to meet Stacy.
Man, I really be like, I be forgetting
like how actively involved I be in stuff.
I met Stacy in 20, did
I meet her last year?
I feel like I met her last
year at a dinner in Atlanta.
And I had just gone to an Annie's List
and Annie's List is an organization,
a national organization, that gives women
training on how to run for office.
So, if you are interested
in running for office
or even just supporting
someone to run for office,
definitely check out Annie's List.
And I had gone to one of the meetings
in Dallas, up in Plano,
and one of the women
who had ran for school board was talking
about her election and particularly
the uniqueness of black
women running for office
and the sacrifice it is for us to run
and I'm just thinking, (clicks tongue)
she had made a comment about needing
a good support system and that
often times you need, and the importance
of, if you were in a relationship
to make sure that that person
is really gonna support you
and Stacey Abrams is
single and I definitely
asked Stacey about, that I feel like
either you see black women
run for office later in life,
like you have the Maxine
Water and the EBJs
and the Sheila Jacksons, but as in
they have older children. Their children
are at least in their teen years,
but you don't see necessarily
younger black women run
and if we are running
in child bearing age,
a lot of us are just
single while we're making
this sacrifice, especially
to run for higher offices
and now that I've gone through training
I'm just realizing that
a lot of that is because
of the odds that are stacked against us
and the sacrifices that it
takes for us to run for office
and that we really do
have to martyr ourselves.
So your entire life is exposed
people will dig into you, and most men
just aren't gonna stick around
for that because patriarchy
is gonna patriarchy
and they don't have to.
I don't remember exactly
how I phrased my question
'cause I feel like when I asked it,
I was realizing this
really aint a question,
this a statement, girl, and
I wanna talk to you about it
'cause I feel you and
Stacey had said to me,
"sis you right and it just is what it is".
She's like, you know, either
I'm gone be passionate
about this or I'm gone
be passionate about that
and, you know, maybe it'll come
and happen for me. Maybe
family and a relationship
will happen for me, but right now
I understand the sacrifice
that I wanted to make,
and I made it and I'm
going to push forward.
An I was like, you know what sis,
I'm very proud of you, (claps)
Okay? Stacy need to win the governorship
as far as I'm concerned. Eff Brian Kemp.
Somebody need to put him in jail.
He's a scab. He's a fraud
and I'm not here for it.
As much anxiety as watching that election
gave me on election night, and to watch
a white man just get away with
doing whatever he obscenely wants to,
I'm particularly proud to see
Stacy put up this fight and I want us
to understand how much
support she does need
because this is a great sacrifice.
It is a very unique place that she is in
as a black woman to put up the sacrifice
and largely, you know, she doesn't have
a spouse to go home to who supports her
the same way that maybe
Andrew Gillum's wife,
you know, supports him
and it's just different
the way that black women
have to approach things.
So, I'm here for it um, and it like
I am probably gonna get my behind
in the car and have to drive to Georgia
and knock on some doors
and put in some hard labor
to volunteer for sis
because she deserves it.
I hope we all pay more attention
to our local elections and volunteer
and get invested in the off season, right?
Because a lot of voter registration,
there's a lot of things happening
in our local legislatures,
especially about healthcare,
around housing, around fines
and fees with the courts
and bail, and different ways
for us to be involved in,
you can't just go vote and then check out,
you have to vote and
hold people accountable.
That's kind of pretty much how I feel
about this most recent midterm election.
Um, I do believe the whole system
needs to come crashing down, but
I continue to participate in the system
it's like living with a disease, right?
And I can improve my quality of life
by seeking treatment and
so I am the treatment.
My voting, my awareness,
my educating my audience,
my investment in this is
me treating the disease
until we find a way to
rip that shit out my body.
Right? Like can we remove this wholly
from the body and get rid of it
and redo it again and I also think that
in order to change a system, we have to
understand what the
system is as a plague`,
and so there is a lot of education
that needs to happen
for the general public
to understand what's happening
so that this huge change that we
wanna see happen can happen because
we're currently getting
a lot of resistance
from it because so many of us,
not just the white folks
that watch Fox News,
I mean Fox News won't
ruin it for all of us,
trust, you need Fox News as
a propaganda hole to Hell.
Alright? But there's plenty of us that are
getting our education from Facebook memes,
who are living in our own eco-chambers
and I'm just trying to encourage us all
to be more aware and invested and involved
and, you know, if the white people
need to be shipped off to Gilead,
we let them do that to
themselves, but, you know,
us over here, we gone
get it together, right?
We gone be ready to
dismantle this whole system
and improve it and not implement
the same ways of our oppressors
and call it liberation 'cause
that's not how that shit work. Alright?
(sigh)
It was a mouth full. I hope people
can understand what I talked about.
Alright. Thanks for
watching. But if any of you
live in Mississippi, please
tell me what is going on.
Please, let me know how I can help
'cause I might have to
drive out to Mississippi
and campaign for voter
registration out there too,
'cause people winning by 700,000 votes
in a state with 3 million people
is just beyond me, if
there was some success
in a local election near you,
please let us know down below and
if there is an organization
that you feel like
that you're aware of locally,
that's been helping folks,
let us know down below, like lets help us
get invested because sometimes, you know,
it's kind of hard sometimes because
everyone doesn't know how to
make themselves more visible
on the internet, so, you know,
you talking about what's happening
and you sharing that with other people
is a great way to get
people more involved.
Alright, comment down below
and I'll holla. Deuces!
