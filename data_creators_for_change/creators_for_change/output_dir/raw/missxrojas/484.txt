video response so military<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nelly</font>

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,570
uploaded a video on the live trade is

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,460
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life changes</font>

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,799
everything I just watch this morning it

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,960
is all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lies as the story that</font>

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">is Cinderella I can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> myself very lucky</font>

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,679
because one of my formative books was

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,170
royal dolls revolting rhymes which I

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,400
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have read but</font>

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,529
basically re-creates fairy stories in

11
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,140
either the traditional grim way or if

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,640
they're not Grimm fairy stories and he

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,070
just make some gross and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just</font>

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,109
brilliant that helps really they're so

15
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,699
funny they're not so centered on the

16
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,189
gays and that by that i mean the ga is

17
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,899
said eve i really wish i had in with me

18
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,399
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have them if you never read</font>

19
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,020
them and you're into children's books as

20
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,149
I am then revolting rhymes it's a great

21
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,309
purchase especially for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our friend this</font>

22
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:42,989
Christmas no one paid me g status and

23
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,700
otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure they'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be at your</font>

24
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,469
local library because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so</font>

25
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,719
funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also know the Grimm's tell</font>

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,399
versions very well and knew them from a

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,989
very young age so I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> no illusions</font>

28
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,820
another formative but for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> Harry</font>

29
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">Potter of course which I read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mistakes</font>

30
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:56,820
but let's not talk about that the famous

31
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,500
five books which I got for my fifth

32
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,180
birthday I think and we're also

33
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,309
incredibly forward to for me and they

34
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,660
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been in a kind of terrible</font>

35
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,549
way because the girl that I like the

36
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,229
most the youngest character a girl

37
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,600
called an who always like to make tea

38
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,560
was um kind of annoying in retrospect

39
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,170
she couldn't swim as fast as everyone

40
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,210
else because she was a girl and she

41
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't a tomboy enough like George she</font>

42
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,470
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give up her feminine side</font>

43
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,900
to become a boy favorite character from

44
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,610
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I don't know why remember</font>

45
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,020
occasions just thinking like just shut

46
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,329
up you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might Julian in many ways that's</font>

47
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,829
why I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm very fortunate to have</font>

48
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a job at a bookshop because it makes</font>

49
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,479
me even more aware of how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> reached a</font>

50
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">child is important because when you're</font>

51
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,320
that age is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like whatever is</font>

52
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,000
given to all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cubs in most</font>

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,500
interesting cover that you pick out the

54
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">library but we shall see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how messed up</font>

55
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,090
my children are and not a linear future

56
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,939
hopefully quite a way down the line<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

57
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's all for me on this video</font>
