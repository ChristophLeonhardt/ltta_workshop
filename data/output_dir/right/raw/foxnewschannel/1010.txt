SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY

88
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,822

SECRETARY POMPEO FOR SPECIFICS.

95
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:50,765

NEGOTIATE WITH THE MEDIA AND

97
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,634

FOOLED BEFORE, THERE'S NO DOUBT

102
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:00,308
ABOUT IT.

103
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:01,175
MANY PRESIDENTS PREVIOUSLY HAVE

104
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:02,777
SIGNED OFF ON PIECES OF PAPER

105
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:04,979
ONLY TO FIND THAT THE

NORTH KOREANS EITHER DIDN'T

107
00:03:06,414 --> 00:03:08,349
PROMISE WHAT WE THOUGHT THEY HAD

108
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:09,484
OR ACTUALLY RENEGED ON THEIR

109
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:11,319
PROMISES.

110
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,089
THE V MATTERS.

111
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:15,790
WE ARE GOING TO ENSURE THAT WE

112
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,926
SET UP A SYSTEM SUFFICIENTLY

113
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:20,161
ROBUST THAT WE ARE ABLE TO

114
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:21,095
VERIFY THESE OUTCOMES AND IT'S

115
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:24,699
ONLY ONCE THE V HAPPENS THAT WE

116
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,801
WILL PROCEED APACE.

117
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:30,271
>> Bret: HEARD THAT FROM A BUT

118
00:03:30,404 --> 00:03:31,873
ELISE, WE ARE TRYING TO GET

119
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:32,240
SPECIFICS.

120
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,208
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING

121
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,610
TO RESPOND EITHER WAY?

122
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,245
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT COUPLE

123
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:37,612

OF NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR

126
00:03:41,182 --> 00:03:41,649
FACILITIES ARE.

127
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:42,717
FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THERE

128
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:44,852
ARE A LOT OF SECRET SITES, WHAT

129
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:46,554
IS GOING ON UNDERGROUND.

130
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:49,590
RIGHT NOW NOT ONLY ARE OUTSIDE

NATION-STATES ABOUT WHAT'S GOING

135
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:58,032
ON NUCEARIZED IN NORTH KOREA.

136
00:03:58,032 --> 00:03:59,367
THERE IS GOING TO BE A PUSH TO

137
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:00,234
TRY TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF

138
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:03,237
WHERE EXACTLY ALL THE SITES ARE,

139
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:05,907
WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS THAT

140
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:06,607

IAEA INSPECTORS.

143
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,619
>> Bret: WAS ALL THE TROUBLES

144
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:19,320
WITH IRAN AND IRAQ AND ALL OF

145
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,987
THE VERIFICATION PROCESSES.

146
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:21,656
JOSH, THE ADMINISTRATION IS

147
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:22,590
SUGGESTING THEY ARE NOT GETTING

148
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,025
ENOUGH CREDIT FOR JUST BEING

149
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:24,725
HERE, THAT ALREADY THE CRITICS

150
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:27,461
ARE TURNING AND SAYING WHAT'S

151
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:29,163
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OUT OF THIS

152
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:30,831
MEETING AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IS

153
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:31,432
HAPPENING CURRENTLY.

154
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:33,100
>> THAT'S RIGHT, BUT ONE OF THE

155
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,835
THINGS THAT A LOT OF A LOT OF

156
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:35,636
LONGTIME NORTH KOREAN MARCHERS

157
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:36,804
HAVE POINTED OUT IS THAT THIS IS

158
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:38,439
A SUMMIT THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE

159
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,640
BEEN AVAILABLE TO ANY U.S.

160
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,408
PRESIDENT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

161
00:04:40,408 --> 00:04:42,076
DECADES THAT WANTED IT.

162
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:43,110
THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE BEEN VERY

163
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,581
EAGER TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF

164
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:47,515
MEETING, BUT PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS

165
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:48,249
THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS NOT WISE

166
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:50,851
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SEE THE

167
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:52,787
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE KIND OF

168
00:04:52,787 --> 00:04:53,521
CONCRETE PROGRESS EMANATE FROM

169
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:55,623
IT THAT THEY WANTED.

170
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:57,024
REALLY THE KEY QUESTION AS WE

171
00:04:57,024 --> 00:04:58,459
HEAD INTO THE SUMMIT IS WILL IT

172
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:59,093
BE MORE THAN A HANDSHAKE?

173
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:02,229
WILL THERE BE SOMETHING

174
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:03,030
SUBSTANTIVE, CONCRETE THAT

175
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,998
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABLE TO SHOW

176
00:05:03,998 --> 00:05:06,400
AND IF NOT, HOW DOES HE DEFEND

177
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,736
THE RISK THAT HE TOOK WITH DOING

178
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:09,036
THIS?

179
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:11,005
>> Bret: 30 SECONDS, WHAT IS

180
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:12,840
THE LEADING EARLY TELL US, DOES

181
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,742
IT TELL US ANYTHING?

182
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:16,010
>> I DON'T KNOW.

183
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:16,644
KIM JONG UN IS REPORTEDLY

184
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:17,578
LEAVING QUITE EARLY AS WELL TO

185
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:20,815
RETURN TO PYONGYANG SO THERE

186
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:21,449
COULD BE SOMETHING ABOUT

187
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:23,918
SIGNALING NOT TRYING TO LEAVE

188
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:25,920
TOO FAR AFTER KIM JONG UN LEADS,

189
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,955
SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE.

190
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:28,723
>> Bret: OBVIOUSLY HE DOESN'T

191
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:29,724
WANT TO BE OUT OF THE COUNTRY

192
00:05:29,724 --> 00:05:30,391
TOO LONG.

193
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:32,727
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT HIS OWN

194
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:33,794
STATUS.

195
00:05:33,794 --> 00:05:34,428
>> THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN

196
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:36,430
INDICATIONS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE

197
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,431
IS TRYING TO LOWER EXPECTATIONS

198
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:39,200
AS IT HAS HEADED INTO THIS.

199
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,934
GONE ARE THE TALKS FROM JUST A

200
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:41,602
FEW DAYS AGO THAT MAYBE WE COULD

201
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:43,137
STRIKE AN END TO THE KOREAN WAR,

202
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:44,772
MAYBE WE COULD ACTUALLY GET A

203
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:45,272
NUCLEAR DEAL HERE.

204
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:46,841
NOW WE ARE POMPEO SAYING

205
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:48,242
HOPEFULLY WE WILL GO INTO THIS

206
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:50,745
LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR MORE

207
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:51,479
FUTURE SUCCESSFUL MEETINGS, SO

208
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,781
THERE'S A SENSE THAT THE

209
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:54,448
ADMINISTRATION HAS A FEELING

210
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:56,550
THAT THIS MAY NOT BE AS BIG AS

211
00:05:56,550 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WANTED TO BE AND DOESN'T
