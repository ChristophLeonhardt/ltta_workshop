it's a unique sport its physical there's a lot of thinking and intelligence that goes into the game there's a whole level of competitiveness that you get in it my grandparents and my parents curled so I got in it through my family and just started curling probably when I was ten years old playing at the 2012 World Championships in Basel Switzerland so we had actually won the u.s. championship that year and got to play against all the best teams in the world first thing you do is you clean the bottom of the rock because if there's any debris on the bottom of the rock it'll pick or go off and a than a bad direction when you first get into the hack you're generally just kind of in a crouched position and you're getting yourself lined up so you pick your target bring your back hopefully if you do it right it ends right on the button you can actually make it travel farther by creating friction with this in front of it so it actually heats up the ice just just a tiny little bit and allows the rock to kind of glide a little bit farther and then the other thing it can do is it can keep it from curling so it'll actually straighten out the path beside the side of the rock is going oh well and that's pretty good you
