00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:23,424
GREG: DO YOU REMEMBER 1969 WEST

00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,960
MARK I DO SOME CALL IT THE GOOD

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,495
OLD DAYS BUT I DON'T.

8
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:28,329
IT SUCKED.

9
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,098
DOW JONES WAS AT 800 AND THE

10
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:31,933
AVERAGE INCOME A YEAR WAS UNDER

11
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:34,135
NINE GRAND AND SOMETHING CALLED

12
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:35,069
WOODSTOCK TOOK PLACE.

13
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:36,604
LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE.

14
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:37,872
YOU KNOW THEY SMELL BAD.

15
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,374
LIKE A FISH IS JOCKSTRAP.

16
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:39,741
[LAUGHTER]

17
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:41,075
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WERE THEM

18
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:41,643
BUT THEY COULD.

19
00:00:41,643 --> 00:00:43,645
WHAT ALSO STUNK WAS FASHION.

20
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:46,014
PEOPLE ACTUALLY WORE THE STUFF

21
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:48,883
OUTSIDE AND THEY WERE TO PELTED

22
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:49,917
WITH HOT GARBAGE.

23
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,587
BASICALLY, THE WORLD REEKED BUT

24
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,489
I COULDN'T DO A THING.

25
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,826
I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD AND HERE IS

26
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:00,595
A PICTURE.

27
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:10,738
[LAUGHTER]

28
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:14,509
[LAUGHTER]

29
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:15,043
I WAS ADORABLE.

30
00:01:15,043 --> 00:01:16,377
BUT I COULD DO NOTHING TO MAKE

31
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:18,813
THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE SO

32
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:21,616
INSTEAD I ATE AS MUCH PLATO AS

33
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:21,983
POSSIBLE.

34
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:23,918
THE POINT IS 1969 WAS A LONG

35
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,920
TIME AGO, 49 YEARS AGO AND YOU

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,856
HAVE TO GO BACK THAT FAR TO FIND

37
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,992
JOBLESS NUMBERS THAT ARE THIS

38
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:31,526
GOOD TODAY.

39
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,161
IT'S TRUE, APPLICATIONS FOR

40
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:35,630
UNAPPOINTED BENEFITS ARE NOW AT

41
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,831
A 49 YEAR LOW.

42
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:38,232
THAT'S ALMOST FIVE DECADES LONG

43
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,735
OF WHAT I CALL ONE EPISODE OF

44
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:41,169
THE VIEW.

45
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:41,536

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

47
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:42,503
EASY JOKE.

48
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:46,374
TRUMP JOB NUMBERS ARE SO GOOD

49
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:49,310
THAT TO MATCH IT YOU HAVE TO GO

50
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,313
BACK TO AN ERA WHEN NOT BATHING

51
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:53,448
WAS CONSIDERED AN ACHIEVEMENT.

52
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,283
THAT IS WHAT WE CALLED THE NEWS

53
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,719
AND HUMANS LIKE GOOD NEWS BUT

54
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,352
NOT ALL HUMANS.

55
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,354
>> HE JUST TWEETED THEY ARE

56
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:05,059
MEETING IN SINGAPORE ON JUNE 12

57
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:08,795
AND THEY WILL BOTH TRY TO MAKE A

58
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,497
SPECIAL MOMENT FOR WORLD PEACE.

59
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,332
>> GOOD FOR HIM.

60
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,267
IF IT WORKS, WERE HAPPY FOR HIM.

61
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:17,605
GREG: YOU COULD JUST FEEL JOY'S

62
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:21,075
PAIN WHEN SHE SAID THAT.

63
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,910
IT'S LIKE SHE REALIZED THAT

64
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,316
WASN'T A PART.

65
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:28,683
[LAUGHTER]

66
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,651
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF HUMANS

67
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,720
THAT DON'T LIKE GOOD NEWS.

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,294
THEY ARE CALLED WET BLANKETS.

69
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,529
>> THEIR RELEASE SHOULD NOT BE

70
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,196
EXALTED BUT EXPECTED.

71
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,998
IT IS NO GREATER ACCOMPLISHMENT

72
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,833
OF KIM JONG-UN TO DO THIS.

73
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,969
WHEN THE PRESIDENT DOES IT HE

74
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:59,881
WEAKENS AMERICAN FOREIGN-POLICY

75
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:04,852
WEAKENS AMERICAN FOREIGN-POLICY

76
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,120
AND PUTS AMERICANS AT RISK

77
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,621
AROUND THE WORLD.

78
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,489
GREG: TALK ABOUT THE OPPOSITE OF

79
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:08,990
FUN.

80
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,691
TO HIM THE GLASS IS HALF EMPTY

81
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,059
MUCH LIKE HIS SKULL.

83
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,962
SO, HERE WE HAVE GREAT NEWS BUT

84
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,597
MANY POLITICIANS IN MEDIA HACKS

85
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,332
ALL THEY SEE IS BAD.

86
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,636
IF ONLY THERE WERE A DRUG TO

87
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:22,370
HELP THEM.

88
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,671
>> UNEMPLOYMENT HIT 3.9% WHICH

89
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,107
IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN

90
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:26,440
WORKER.

DELIVER A FATAL BLOW TO ISIS.

93
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,413

198
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,473
THE STENCH OF THE SWAMP.

199

THAT STENCH AFFECTS BOTH TRUMP

200
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:21,942

210
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:40,828
HIDING IN THE HOTEL ROOM

211
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:43,230
WATCHING TV AND IS STUCK ON THE

212
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,697

213
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,800
IT'S WEIRD IT'S LIKE THE MEDIA

215
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:48,436

216
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:49,737

AND SO THEY HAVE FOLLOWED IN AND

224
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:02,049
THEY CAN'T GET UP.

225
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:05,686
I FEAR THAT IF SOMEONE DOESN'T

226
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,522
PULL THEM ON A PLATTER THEY WILL

227
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,124
END UP EATING EACH OTHER ALIVE.

GETTING STUFF DONE.

253
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,624
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

254
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,792
>> YEAH, THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE

255
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,294
ELECTED HIM TO DO.

256
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,896
HE WAS SAYING CRAZY STUFF AND

257
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,898
EVERYONE A KNOWLEDGE HE HAD THIS

258
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:26,133
CRAZY PAST BUT WE WERE LIKE, WE

259
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:29,303
WANT A GUY AND I DIDN'T VOTE FOR

260
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:32,139

TO GET THE JOB DONE.

263
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:39,146
IT'S HYSTERICAL WHEN YOU WATCH

264
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,215
THESE VIDEOS BECAUSE I THINK THE

265
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:43,083
MEDIA IS SO INVESTED IN HIS

266
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,151
DEMISE THAT THEY HAVE DECIDED

267
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,420
THAT THEY WENT ON RECORD AND

268
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,889
SAID THIS GUY WILL BE A BIG

269
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,157
FAILURE AND A BIG JOKE.

270
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,893
SO WHEN HE DOES WELL THEY LOOK

271
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:54,762
DUMB AND THEY LOOK LIKE THEY

272
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:55,729
WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION AND

273
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,631
THEIR PREDICTIONS ARE WRONG SO

274
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:58,999
THERE INVESTED IN HIM PEELING

275
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,402
AND THEY DON'T CARE THAT MAY

276
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,571
MEAN THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

277
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,673
MAY SUFFER THAT YOUR PAYCHECKS

278
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:07,007
WILL BE LOWER AND THAT OUR

279
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,375
NATIONAL SECURITY MIGHT BE

280
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,910
THREATENED WAS FASCINATING TO

281
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,278
WATCH BECAUSE SPECIFICALLY WITH

282
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,681
THE PRISONERS THAT WERE BROUGHT

283
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,349
BACK THAT WAS A STORY THAT

284
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:16,917
EVERYONE ACROSS THE AISLE, BOTH

285
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,853
SIDES OF THE AISLE HAD TO COME

286
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,456
FORWARD AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

287
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,924
THIS WAS A GOOD THING.

288
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,460
BUT THEY ARE SUFFERING WHEN YOU

289
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,061
WATCH THEM.

290
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,697
IT'S SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT LETS

EVERYBODY KNOW THAT EVERYONE HAS

292
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,034

294
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,904

401
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,013
WHEN THEY FINALLY TALKED ABOUT

402
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,616
