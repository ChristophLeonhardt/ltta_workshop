welcome back to KCDC we have brand new polling on president Trump's handling of Russia following his summit with Vladimir Putin an NBC News Wall Street Journal poll released tonight shows that just 26% of registered voters approve of the president's handling of the us-russia relationship fifty-one percent say they disapprove and one issue that received bipartisan outrage was the president's consideration of a plan that would have allowed the Kremlin to question US officials in exchange for making the 12 Russians recently indicted by robert muller available for questioning by the u.s. after leaving the question open the White House now says the president disagrees with that one American interest to Moscow's former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul here's where it gets scary there's something called interpol where they can go around in third countries and stop people like me mr. Browder his book is called red notice because that's what you put in the Interpol system and he has been harassed for years by the gushin government because they use the Interpol service for political purposes joining me now is bill Browder who we were just talking to about this time last sunday just hours before Vladimir Putin called him out by name during his news conference with President Trump mr. Browder it's great to have you back can I just ask you you know what was going through your head when you watch that news conference well well well the rest of the world was was shocked that that Putin was bringing up my name he's been bringing it up since 2012 since since the Magnitsky Act was passed in 2012 which shows named after my murdered Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky and it's sanctions human rights violators in Russia including very close cronies of Vladimir Putin and so from my perspective it was just more of the same in fact I'd even thought about tweeting out before the summit I wonder if Putin is gonna bring up my name but I thought that might be a little bit too self-centered turns out not apparently not indeed what was your take on what we saw unfold over the course of the past week I mean as somebody who is interacted with the Russian government in one way or the other for a long time and did the president get taken for a ride what happened well IIIi think he was hopefully unprepared I don't think he probably didn't know anything about me Sergei Magnitsky or any of that type of stuff and so he probably didn't have any idea how unbelievably evil and even considering Putin's Indecent Proposal of swapping me and others for a bunch of Russians was I think that that's my take on on on Donald Trump's situation he just didn't do his homework but the fact that it took him three days to basically reject Vladimir Putin's proposal is wholly unacceptable it took everybody else about 12 seconds to reject that proposal and it shouldn't have taken him three days what's your take on you know some of what we have seen out out of the the meeting the fact that that Putin is now apparently scheduled to come here to the United States well the last Sunday when I was on your show one of my main points before the summit was that there shouldn't have been a summit in Helsinki in the first place Vladimir Putin is a malign influence on the world he's been redrawing the borders and by invading Ukraine he's been bombing innocent women and children in Syria he's been cheating in the Olympics and meddling in the various elections this is a guy who needs to be contained not engaged and so there shouldn't have been a first summit and there absolutely should not be we shouldn't be dignifying Vladimir Putin with a state visit to Washington and makes no sense at all there was clearly quite a bit of discomfort in the Congress with how this all played out over the course of the past week although there were some mixed results as to exactly how aggressively the Senate was willing to push back on on various pieces of this what is it that Congress could do that would actually hit Putin in a way that would really make a difference to him is there anything they can do well there there is something that they have done and the Trump administration is done which is going after the richest oligarchs in Russia and sanctioning them sanctioning their assets and that was done by the Trump administration on April 6th were they added seven of the richest Russian oligarchs to the sanctions list and it was an absolute neutron bomb going off over Moscow and so there's a big schizophrenia going on right now in terms of the Trump administration and their policy towards Russia and Trump's own personal words about Vladimir Putin the Trump administration has been tough or tougher than the Obama administration on Russia the sanctions are in place there is offensive weapons going to Ukraine there's absolutely devastating consequences to Russian mercenaries in Syria who do the wrong thing what's strange and on taste distasteful is this unbelievable bonhomie or buddy-buddy stuff going on between Trump and Vladimir Putin where the effectively legitimizes Vladimir Putin as a person which should not be done by by the the the most powerful person in the free world till Browder thank you very much for your time tonight sir really appreciate it Thank You Phil and you Misha I'm going to get your taken your latest reporting on on where things stand with this potential summit for the fall because I mean as much as we talked about you know Dan coats his position his what he said that they could hurt his future he really came in he had no idea as a Director of National Intelligence that this meeting was coming down the pike it seems like that again is another example of the administration acting alone without necessarily mentioning it to the other pieces of a government yeah it's more like the president acting largely alone the way this meeting announcement came about Thursday was earlier in the week president Trump and President Putin discussed the likelihood of having additional meetings that they would get together again and I think that they even said so publicly but president Trump woke up Thursday morning he was upset with the news media coverage of his Helsinki summit and he called John Bolton his national security adviser with an order saying get this summit scheduled invite Putin to Moscow make it happen and within a few hours it did happen and Sarah Sanders the press secretary announced it over Twitter actually during the dan coates interview with Andrea Mitchell or that Putin was being invited to Washington yeah Michael Schmidt does this how does this play into the Muller investigation if at all I mean the one of the final questions of that news conference was you know to Putin and saying hey you know do you have something on this president is that a factor here the other thing that they raised was this idea of Muller's investigators going over there to present the evidence or to learn you know to sort of tell them what they had found about the the Russians I'm not sure that that really changes anything the thing about the Putin meeting that I find funny is that if Coates had a problem code said he thought it was unusual that the foreign minister and the Ambassador had met with Trump in the Oval Office in May and now you have Putin coming to the White House now given all the things that have come out after that you kind of wonder what Coates will do or say between now and the summit well he simply just allow it to happen or will he speak up again the way he did he already tried to backtrack and what he said at the end of the week yeah that would be President Trump is also in some ways very much he's very much digging in its heels he doesn't like the coverage but he wants to go it alone he wants to drive this train and as a result if he wants to bring Putin to the White House he's gonna do that dan coates releasing a statement basically saying I'm sorry if I if you took this the wrong way and I don't want to disrespect you kind of tells you that President Trump is leading this train and that people are very much trying to stay in his good graces in some ways even though Dan Coates is saying he was he felt led to correct the president when he initially said that he didn't know if Russia meddled in the election dan coates is still taking it's still walking even that back a little bit and saying hey at the end of the day this this interview might have looks bad and I want to make sure that you know that I'm on your side yeah I'm not sure he had any other choice hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to
