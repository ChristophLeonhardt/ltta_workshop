the Israeli Prime Minister's in Berlin on the first leg of his European trip where he's looking to push for the 2015 Iran nuclear deal to be dropped Benjamin Netanyahu and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have just finished their talks and have spoken to journalists there in the German capital let's go there live now our Europe correspondent Peter Oliver's there has mr. Netanyahu had any success in getting Angela Merkel on side well Benjamin Netanyahu certainly been trying on this first leg of his three-day European tour where he's been meeting or will be meeting with EU leaders to try and convince them to follow the United States's lead and move away from the Iran nuclear deal now mr. Netanyahu used his time at the podium to criticize the Iranian government that was a very bad deal because it gave Iran the capacity also to develop advanced centrifuges 40 times more effective in the intervening years so they could have an unlimited enrichment capacity in a few years that's not a good deal we see that Iran is devouring one country after the other Yemen Syria I'm talking about military presence and enhance their shipments of lethal weapons and obviously they continue to espouse our destruction and and the conquest of the Middle East so I think that the deal also released a lot of cash for Iran which helps them achieve these goals well if what was said by the leaders at the podiums anything to go by we can pretty much gather this Prime Minister Netanyahu's words to Angola Merkel fell on deaf deaf ears the German Chancellor using her time addressing the media to say that Germany and her self remain committed to trying to save the Iran deal although we have a different opinion here as to the usefulness of jcpoa and its effectiveness Germany did not cancel this agreement together with other European partners we stand by it but we were at one and saying that this issue of regional influence of Iran is a very worrying one particularly for the security of the State of Israel well this is a pretty tough sell for Benjamin Netanyahu obviously doesn't seem like he had any influence on Angela Merkel's ideas expect pretty much the same as he heads to London and to Paris that's because European leaders are upset at the move by the United States to pull out of the Iran deal they cite the years of diplomatic effort that went into getting the deal in the first place the economic value of the deal too many European career companies and the fact that a lot of the senior officials in Europe particularly Angela Merkel feel let down by the United States pulling out of this so we can really expect Benjamin Netanyahu to hear similar things as he heads off to London and to Paris the government regrets the decision of the US administration to withdraw from the deal what do we want to be vassals that would abate blindly to what Americans tell them we are insisting so much in keeping this agreement and we want to have economic relations with Iran acting already Union level to make sure that the nuclear agreement is preserved Trump has lost the battle ultimately no one followed his decisions and now we have to make good on fulfilling our obligations the work some concessions from Angela Merkel towards Benjamin Netanyahu she said that Germany would provide diplomatic assistance with dealing with what Benjamin Netanyahu called Iranian meddling in certain parts of the world but when it came to issues like the moving of the US Embassy to Jerusalem Angela Merkel said she didn't wasn't on side with that and also she condemned the violence that sprung up around that decision it was made by Donald Trump so Benjamin Netanyahu goes off to try his luck with Theresa May and Emmanuel Mac or next but he can well imagine a similar type of reception will be awaiting him in both London and in Paris as well she will one down two to go will be across those meetings as well for now though Peter Oliver in Berlin thanks for
