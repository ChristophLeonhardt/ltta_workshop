This is the first offshore wind
farm in the United States.
It's still small.
Only five turbines.
But can power about 17,000
homes on Block Island, 
about four miles away.
That guy in the orange helmet
is Paul Murphy.
He's a civil engineer who
helped design
the Block Island wind farm 
and does routine inspections,
like you see here.
He says this project could just
be the beginning 
of what's to come.
Onshore wind farm technician is
the fastest growing job
in the U.S., according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
And Mr. Murphy predicts the
trend will expand  
to offshore, sites as well 
and create thousands of jobs
as the industry grows.
For now, Block Island is the
testing ground
for the future of offshore
wind farming.
And working here, Mr. Murphy
says, comes with
one obvious perk.
My first thought is when I step
on the helideck
and you're 330 feet above the
sea looking at these turbines
it's a pretty awesome sight.
It's awesome because it's a
real engineering achievement.
And I think this is a real
environmental achievement.
