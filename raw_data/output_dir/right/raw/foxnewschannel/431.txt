00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:06,247
>> Shepard: 23 MINUTES BEFORE

2
00:00:06,247 --> 00:00:08,716

OWNERSHIP.

9
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:21,262
THE PRESIDENT LED AN EFFORT TO

10
00:00:21,262 --> 00:00:23,698
SILENCE STORMY DANIELS, AND SAID

11
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:25,800
HE WOULD PAY ALL THE LEGAL COSTS

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,534
INVOLVED.

13
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:28,736
ACCORDING TO THE REPORTING OF

14
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:29,437
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" BACK

15
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:30,972
IN FEBRUARY, PRESIDENT TRUMP

16
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:32,940
ORDERED HIS THEN LAWYER AND

STORMY DANIELS WITH HELP FROM

20
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:39,947
THE PRESIDENT'S SON, ERIC TRUMP.

21
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:43,051
THE JOURNAL REPORTS ERIC TRUMP

22
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:44,752
THEN GOT A TRUMP ORGANIZATION

23
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:46,354
LAWYER TO HELP WITH ALL THE

24
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:46,721

25
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:49,490
THE GOAL HERE, PREVENT STORMY

26
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,558
DANIELS FROM IGNORING A

27
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:51,259
NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT FROM

28

HER FROM TALKING ABOUT HER CLAIM

30
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,400
THAT SHE HAD WITH TRUMP A DECADE

31
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,502
BEFORE THAT, LONG BEFORE HE

32
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:01,870
BECAME PRESIDENT, BUT NOT LONG

33
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,304
AFTER HIS WIFE MILANI I BIRTH TO

34
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:07,509
THEIR SON.

35
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:08,343
NONE OF IT WORKED.

36
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:09,744
STORMY DANIELS DID GO PUBLIC AS

37
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:11,679
WE ALL KNOW AND DID AN INTERVIEW

38
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,348
WITH 60 MINUTES ON CBS.

39
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:15,917
MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE

40
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:16,251
WATCHED.

41
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:18,353
UNTOLD NUMBERS HAVE SEEN IT

42
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:19,154
SINCE ONLINE.

43
00:01:19,154 --> 00:01:19,921
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DENIED THAT

44
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:25,393
HE HAD WITH THAT PERSON, BUT HE

45
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:28,230
ADMITS REIMBURSING COHEN FOR THE

46
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,698
$130,000 THAT DANIELS RECEIVED

47
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,766
BEFORE THE ELECTION TO KEEP

48
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:32,334
QUIET.

49
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:34,135
MICHAEL: PLEADED GUILTY IN

50
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,337
AUGUST TO VIOLATING CAMPAIGN

51
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:36,371
FINANCE LAW AND COULD SPEND

52
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:38,073
YEARS IN PRISON.

53
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:40,942
HE SAID THAT TRUMP DIRECTED HIM,

54
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:39,975
TO ARRANGE THE PAYMENT TODAY ANT

55
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:46,348
THAT DONALD TRUMP DIRECTED HIM

56
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:46,948
TO ARRANGE THE PAYMENT TODAY ANO

57
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:48,116
DANIELS.

58
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:49,351
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYER, RUDY

59
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:50,418
GIULIANI, AS OF THAT MICHAEL

60
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:51,953
COHEN IS NOT CREDIBLE AND THAT

61
00:01:51,953 --> 00:01:52,654
NONE OF THE CHARGES INVOLVED

62
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:56,658
WRONGDOING BY THE PRESIDENT.

63
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,392
MOST OF THIS WE ALREADY KNEW,

64
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:59,327
BUT "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"

65
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,163
REPORTS IS A FIRST TIME THAT

66
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,764
WE'VE HEARD THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

67
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:04,733
HIMSELF WAS INVOLVED IN TRYING

68
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:06,735
TO SILENCE DANIELS, MUCH LESS

69
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:09,571
THAT HE LED THE WHOLE THING.

70
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:11,540
LET'S TURN TO MICHAEL ROTH

71
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,941
FIELD, AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER

72
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:13,742
WITH "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"

73
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:14,743
AND COWROTE TODAY'S PIECE.

74
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:18,347
NICE TO HAVE YOU.

75
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:18,814
SO HE LED THAT.

76
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:20,582
HOW DID YOU COME TO THAT THROUGH

77
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:22,851
YOUR REPORTING?

78
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,519
>> Michael: JUST TALKING TO

79
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,288
SOURCES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

80
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:27,289
WE INITIALLY REPORTED THAT A

81
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:29,324
TRUMP ORGANIZATION LAWYER WAS

82
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:30,025
INVOLVED IN THIS CONFIDENTIAL

83
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:30,893
ARBITRATION PROCEEDING THAT WAS

84
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:33,962
BACK IN MARCH, A MONTH AFTER

85
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:35,530
THAT HAPPENED, AND CONTINUING

86
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,531
REPORTING, WE LEARNED THAT IN

87
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,934
FACT THERE WERE TWO PHONE CALLS

88
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:41,103
THAT LED TO THAT WITH

89
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:41,870
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MICHAEL

90
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,170
COHEN.

91
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,407
ONE IN MID-FEBRUARY, FIRST WITH

92
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:47,342
THE PRESIDENT TOLD MICHAEL

93
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:49,745
COHEN, THEN HIS LAWYER, TO

94
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:50,779
COORDINATE WITH ERIC TRUMP, AND

95
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:52,748
HIS SON, AND WITH LAWRENCE

96
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:54,249
ROSEN, AN OUTSIDE LAWYER.

97
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:56,551
THEN A SECOND ONE A FEW DAYS

98
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,154
LATER IN ROSEN'S OFFICE.

99
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:00,856
TRUMP TOLD COHEN, I'LL TAKE CARE

100
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:02,358
OF EVERYTHING, MEANING THE

101
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:03,359
BILLS, AND JUST HANDLE THIS AND

102
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,761
MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T GO ON

103
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:06,762
TELEVISION.

104
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:07,763
>> Shepard: YOU SAID

105
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:08,564
COORDINATE WITH THEM.

106
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,465
COORDINATE WITH THEM IN THE

107
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:11,033
EFFORT TO MAKE SURE SHE HOLDS UP

108
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:15,504
HER END OF THE BARGAIN?

109
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:16,505
>> Michael: AND THAT SHE

110
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:19,308
DOESN'T TALK OR DO THIS IN AN

111
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:20,342
ARBITRATION HEARING BECAUSE IT

112
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:22,111
WOULD BE LIKE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

113
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:24,446
IN THE CONTRACT THAT YOU HAVE,

114
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:25,714
YOU GO SECRETLY INTO ARBITRATION

115
00:03:25,714 --> 00:03:27,916
AND TRY TO GET A DECISION.

116
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,853
BUT AS YOU NOTED, STORMY DANIELS

117
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:32,921
NOTED

118
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,957
IGNORED THAT INJUNCTION THAT

119
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:35,424
THEY ATTAINED.

120
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,191
>> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

121
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:37,359
DENIALS ON EVERY LEVEL OF THIS

122
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:40,229
HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS AND THOROUGH,

123
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,530
HAVE THEY NOT?

124
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,765
>> Michael: THAT'S RIGHT.

125
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,233
AT THE BEGINNING, AFTER WE

126
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,335
REPORTED THE EXISTENCE OF THIS

127
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:48,137
HUSH AGREEMENT, THE WHITE HOUSE

128
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:49,371
AND THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION, EVEN

129
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:50,773
MICHAEL COHEN, DISTANCE THE

130
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,975
PRESIDENT FROM THIS AND SAID

131
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:53,642
BASICALLY, THIS WAS MICHAEL

132
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:55,978
COHEN WHO DID THIS, YOU HAVE TO

133
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:57,179
TALK TO MICHAEL COHEN.

134
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:57,913
THE PRESIDENT DENIES EVERYTHING

135
00:03:57,913 --> 00:04:01,717
BUT IN FACT WE KNOW HE WAS

136
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:02,251
INTIMATELY INVOLVED.

137
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:04,854
>> Shepard: VIEWERS MAY HAVE A

138
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:05,588
MEMORY BECAUSE SOMETIMES

139
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:06,389
INFORMATION WILL TRIGGER A

140
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:08,324
MEMORY ON SUCH THINGS.

141
00:04:08,324 --> 00:04:09,258
REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT WAS ON

142
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:10,726
AIR FORCE ONE AND HE CAME BACK

143
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:12,161
TO WHERE THE PRESS WAS.

144
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:13,262
THE PRESS ASKED HIM ABOUT IT AND

145
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:15,565
HE SAID, YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK MY

146
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:19,000
LAWYER ABOUT THAT.

147
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,939
VEITH FIVE RIGHT, HE ACTED LIKE

148
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:24,574
HE NEVER KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

149
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:26,375
>> Shepard: THE IMPORTANCE OF

150
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,778
WHO LED THIS, IT REALLY CAN'T BE

151
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:31,247
OVERSTATED BECAUSE OF THE BIGGER

152
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:32,782
INVESTIGATION INVOLVED.

153
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:34,383
>> Michael: THAT'S RIGHT.

154
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:36,752
MICHAEL: PLEADED GUILTY IN

155
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:37,520
SETTING COURT THAT THE PRESIDENT

156
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,556
HAD DIRECTED HIM TO MAKE THIS

157
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:42,191
DEAL ON THE FIRST PLACE AND

158
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,960
ALSO COORDINATE ON KAREN

159
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,561
McDOUGALL, A "PLAYBOY" MODEL

160
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:48,130
THAT HAD BEEN PAID BY THE

161
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:48,865
"NATIONAL ENQUIRER" BEFORE THE

162
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:49,332
ELECTIONS.

163
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:51,968
THAT MAY STILL PLAY OUT IN OTHER

164
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:52,735
INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE ONGOING.

165
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:53,402
>> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT

166
00:04:53,402 --> 00:04:57,206
FURTHER MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT

167
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:57,840
KEEPING THINGS QUIET ABOUT

168
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,708
MATTERS OF THIS NATURE WAS DONE

169
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,912
FOR THE REASON OF PROTECTING HIS

170
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:03,246
FAMILY.

171
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:05,548
NOT TO HURT HIS CHILD AND HIS

172
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:07,016
WIFE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS

173
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:07,750
FAMILY.

174
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,385
THE BIGGER QUESTION IS, WHETHER

175
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:11,354
THIS WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO, OR

176
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:12,955
IF NOT DIRECTLY, OBSTRUCTION OF

177
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:15,458
JUSTICE IN THE FACE OF THE

178
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,759
INVESTIGATION.

179
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,161
>> Michael: WE HAVEN'T HEARD

180
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:18,461
THAT.

181
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,162
>> Shepard: THAT'S WHAT I'M

182
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:21,965
SAYING, THAT WOULD BE THE OPEN

183
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:22,332
QUESTION.

184
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:24,033
>> Michael: RIGHT, I DON'T

185
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:24,367
KNOW.

186
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,635
>> Shepard: NOR DO WE.

187
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:28,137
THE REASON THE PRESIDENT SAID

188
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:29,939
THEY KEPT SUCH THINGS QUIET WAS

189
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:30,640
BECAUSE OF HIS FAMILY.

190
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,208
THIS COULD VERY WELL BE A

191
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,443
PIVOTAL MATTER IF YOU ARE A MAN

192
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:37,380
WHO IS DOING THIS INVESTIGATION.

193
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,982
AND ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT WE

194
00:05:38,982 --> 00:05:40,917
NOW KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT

195
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:44,320
DIRECTED ALL OF THIS, IS THERE

196
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,021
ANYTHING NEW ABOUT THIS AFFAIR

197
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:48,124
FROM BEGINNING TO END?

198
00:05:48,124 --> 00:05:50,326
>> Michael: WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED

199
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:52,762
LESS ON -- WHILE YOU SAY AFFAIR,

200
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:53,963
YOU DON'T MEAN THE AFFAIR.

201
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:56,533
>> Shepard: I MEAN THE AFFAIR

202
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,567
AS A WHOLE WAS AS INVESTIGATED

203
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:57,934
ON.

204
00:05:57,934 --> 00:05:59,269
>> Michael: WE ARE LEARNING

205
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:01,171
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

206
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:03,840
INVOLVEMENT THROUGH COHEN'S

207
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,775
GUILTY PLEA AND LEARNING THAT HE

208
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:06,910
WAS MORE INVOLVED FROM BEGINNING

209
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,345
TO END IN ALL OF THIS.

210
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:11,181
WE HEARD A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, A

211
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,549
TAPE OF TRUMP TALKING TO MICHAEL

212
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:13,583
COHEN ABOUT THE KAREN

213
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,618
McDOUGALL PAYMENT DURING THE

214
00:06:14,618 --> 00:06:15,852
CAMPAIGN AND POTENTIALLY BUYING

215
00:06:15,852 --> 00:06:17,587
THE RIGHTS TO THAT.

216
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,222
WE LEARN FROM COHEN IN COURT

217
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:21,157
THAT TRUMP WAS INVOLVED IN BOTH

218
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:22,158
STORMY DANIELS AND KAREN

219
00:06:22,158 --> 00:06:23,360
McDOUGALL PAYMENTS AND NOW WE

220
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,562
ARE FINDING OUT THAT AFTER THE

221
00:06:25,562 --> 00:06:27,597
ELECTION OR AFTER WE REVEALED AT

222
00:06:27,597 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT TRUMP WAS CONTINUING TO TRY
