Here on Copacabana Beach
thousands of citizens called on
President Michel Temer to resign.
Recently an audio recording of
the president discussing plans
to obstruct an anti-corruption
drive has been released, causing uproar.
Temer has been president for
only a year since his
predecessor, Dilma Rousseff,
was herself impeached.
The protesters' slogan "Diretas JÃ¡!"
calls for direct elections
for Temer's replacement.
They are fed up with rampant corruption
scandals in their government.
The president's approval rating
is less than 10 percent.
So far he's resisted calls to
resign and instead temporarily
deployed the military against
the ongoing protests.
A panel of judges could invalidate his
presidency or he could be impeached.
If not, Temer could remain
president until 2018
when there will be fresh
elections.
