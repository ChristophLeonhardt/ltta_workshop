00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,969
and they say that it's a rescue

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,539
is a really difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> and painstaking</font>

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:25,830
task because you can imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,240
know if you can see behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> me but just</font>

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,150
balanced on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">simply slam to a stop when the bridge</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">rubble and concrete and that is what is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">making this rescue operation so</font>

20
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,410

<font color="#CCCCCC">workers are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having to use large</font>

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">they use their hands pickaxes really</font>

because as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours pass of course it</font>

27
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,979
will become more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult for</font>

perceived<font color="#E5E5E5"> the safety of the bridge</font>

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,670
in this city<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what's interesting is</font>

52
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,399
two years ago it was being renovated and

at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> several</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people raised the</font>

58
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the question now why was nothing done</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and what some people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are saying is was</font>

82
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:18,680
was something that the team felt today

83
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">as we were approaching this bridge again</font>

84

<font color="#E5E5E5">those bridges you do wonder is the</font>

structurally it's an enormous<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>
