1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,753
THAT, THEN NO ONE WOULD HAVE

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:03,887
3W4R50E6D HIM.

3
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:05,255
STEVE: HE AMPED IT UP.

4
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,391
MERCEDES SCHLAPP IS A SENIOR

5
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:08,492
WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS

6
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:10,261
DIRECTOR SHEET JOINS FROM

7
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,862
OUR NATION'S CAPITAL.

8
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:13,397
I'M SURE GOING ARE IN I'M

9
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:14,565
SURE THE WHITE HOUSE HAD

10
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:15,566
ADVICE FOR HIM.

11
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:16,967
WAS ONE OF THE PIECES OF

12
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:18,135
ADVICE YOU BETTER LOOK LIKE

13
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:18,869
YOU ARE FIGHTING?

14
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,104
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

15
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:20,938
I HAVE KNOWN BRETT KAVANAUGH

16
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,708
FOR A LONG TIME AND HE IS A

17
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:25,042
FIGHTER.

18
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:26,243
HE KNEW SO WELL THAT IT WAS

19
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:26,944
HIS MOMENT.

20
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,212
HIS MOMENT TO TELL THE WORLD

21
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:30,447
THAT HE WAS INNOCENT OF THIS

22
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:30,781
CHARGE.

23
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,815
THAT IT IS BECAUSE OF HIS

24
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:33,183
FINE REPUTATION, ONE WHERE

25
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:34,985
HE HAS SERVED OUR NATION

26
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:36,487
HONORABLY FOR OVER 25 YEARS

27
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:38,822
TO BE ABLE TO SHARE HIS

28
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:39,123
STORY.

29
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,824
AND THE MERE FACT THAT YOU

30
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:43,193
HAVE HAD THE DEMOCRATS

31
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:45,996
MISTREAT HIM IN A WAY,

32
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:49,199
MISHANDLE THIS PROCESS IS A

33
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:49,900
COMPLETE OUTRAGE.

34
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,669
THE MERE FACT THAT SENATOR

35
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:53,037
FEINSTEIN SAT ON THIS LETTER

36
00:00:53,037 --> 00:00:58,642
FOR OVER 60 DAYS AND DID

37
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,777
NOTHING SEWED NOTHING AND

38
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:00,911
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE

39
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:02,913
IS THIS LEAK THAT CAME OUT

40
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:03,947
RIGHT BEFORE THIS VOTE THAT

41
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:05,749
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN ON JUDGE

42
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:07,451
KAVANAUGH AND JUDGE

43
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:11,488
KAVANAUGH CAME WITH THE

44
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,523
FACTS HE OPENED HIS HEART

45
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:13,357
AND SPOKE THE TRUTH.

46
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:14,692
FROM THERE IT'S JUST SO

47
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:15,759
TELLING THE FACT THAT THIS

48
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,394
MAN DESERVES TO BE ON THE

49
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:17,895
SUPREME COURT.

50
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:18,462
BRIAN: WHAT WE HEARD

51
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:19,229
YESTERDAY OVER AND OVER

52
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,164
AGAIN TO BRETT KAVANAUGH AS

53
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,632
IF THEY HAD SHORT-TERM

54
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:23,100
MEMORY LOSS EVERY DEMOCRATIC

55
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,134
LAWMAKER, WHY DON'T YOU CALL

56
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:25,336
FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION?

57
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:28,105
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THE WHITE

58
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:29,240
HOUSE.

59
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,208
LOOK AT DON MCGAHN DICK

60
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,910
DURBIN SAID CALL FOR AN FBI

61
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,377
INVESTIGATION.

62
00:01:33,377 --> 00:01:33,878
WHY WOULDN'T YOU?

63
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:35,613
>> LET'S REMEMBER THE PEOPLE

64
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:36,247
CALLING FOR THE FBI

65
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:36,881
INVESTIGATION, THEY HAVE

66
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:37,882
ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MIND.

67
00:01:37,882 --> 00:01:39,216
THEY HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY

68
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:42,553
ARE VOTING NO ON BRETT

69
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:43,454
KAVANAUGH FROM DAY ONE SINCE

70
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:45,156
HE WAS NOMINATED THESE

71
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:46,424
DEMOCRATS CAME OUT IN FULL

72
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:47,224
FORCE.

73
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:48,292
THEY SAID THEY WOULD DO

74
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:48,993
EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING THEY

75
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:49,827
COULD TO STOP HIM.

76
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:50,561
AND THAT'S WHEN THEY

77
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:51,562
STEARATED TO DRAG HIS NAME

78
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:52,096
IN THE MUD.

79
00:01:52,096 --> 00:01:53,331
THAT'S WHEN THESE

80
00:01:53,331 --> 00:02:02,940
SACKIZATIONS CAME OUT I'M

81
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,243
VERY SYMPATHETIC TO DID

82
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:06,077
DR. FORD WITH THAT STEAD

83
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:10,281
THERE WAS A LACK OF FACTS.

84
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:11,616
AND HERE CAME JUDGE

85
00:02:11,616 --> 00:02:12,617
KAVANAUGH BEING ABLE TO TALK

86
00:02:12,617 --> 00:02:13,451
ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO

87
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:15,119
HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR ALL OF

88
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:16,387
HIS LIFE ABOUT HIS

89
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:16,754
CHARACTER.

90
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:18,556
THIS HAS BEEN A CHARACTER

91
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:19,157
ASSASSINATION BY THE

92
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:19,524
DEMOCRATS.

93
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:21,125
THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF

94
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,394
THEMSELVES ON WHAT THEY HAVE

95
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:25,596
DONE IN TERMS OF BELITTLING

96
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:28,232
THIS MAN, THIS FINE MAN WHO

97
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,935
HAS DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO

98
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:32,537
PUBLIC SERVICE WHO HAS BEEN

99
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:34,806
VERY GOOD FAMILY MAN, A GOOD

100
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:36,307
FRIEND TO SOME OF US.

101
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:37,475
AND HAS PROMOTED WOMEN

102
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:38,910
DURING HIS CAREER.

103
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,578
SO, IT'S JUST OUTSTANDING

104
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:41,779
THAT THE DEMOCRATS WOULD GO

105
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,381
SO LOW AND THAT WAS THE

106
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:44,716
DISPLAY THAT THEY SHOWED,

107
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:45,950
THE PUBLIC DISPLAY THAT THE

108
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,951
DEMOCRATS SHOWED YESTERDAY

109
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:48,686
WAS THE FACT THAT WE KNEW

110
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:50,321
THAT THIS WAS A POLITICAL

111
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:51,890
WITCH HUNTINGTON AGAINST

112
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,590
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

113
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,592
SO, TO SAY FOR THEM TO SAY

114
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,727
OH, LET'S GO WITH THE FBI

115
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:56,394
INVESTIGATION, WHY CAN'T WE

116
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:57,162
DO THAT?

117
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:57,428
NO.

118
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,997
THEY WANT TO BUY TIME.

119
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:01,099
THEY WANT TO BUY TWO MORE

120
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,935
MONTHS, GET THROUGH THIS

121
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:04,302
ELECTION.

122
00:03:04,302 --> 00:03:05,170
THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED AT

123
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,171
ALL ON THE CONCLUSIONS OR

124
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:07,038
THE RESULTS.

125
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:08,173
LET'S REMEMBER THAT THIS

126
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:09,607
COMMITTEE, SENATE COMMITTEE

127
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,875
HAS SORELY INVESTIGATED.

128
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,676
THEY HAVE DONE WHAT THEY

129
00:03:11,676 --> 00:03:13,945
COULD TO DEPOLITICIZE THIS

130
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,313
PROCESS AND THE REPUBLICANS

131
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:16,748
AS WELL HAVE DONE WHAT THEY

132
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:19,050
COULD TO REACH OUT TO

133
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:19,417
DR. FORD.

134
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:21,252
EVEN OFFERED TO GO OVER TO

135
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:22,387
CALIFORNIA AND SHE WASN'T

136
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:23,922
EVEN AWARE OF IT.

137
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:24,189
WHY?

138
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:27,325
BECAUSE HER LAWYERS ARE

139
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:28,960
PRO-DEMOCRAT POLITICAL

140
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,360
OPERATIVES.

141
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,296
OF COURSE, REFERRED TO BY

142
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,964
SENATOR FEINSTEIN.

143
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:33,631
AINSLEY: YOU KNOW, DID I

144
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,300
LIKE HOW THEY HELD THE

145
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,934
DEMOCRATS ACCOUNTABLE FOR

146
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:38,236
THINGS THEY HAD SAID IN THE

147
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:38,536
PAST.

148
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:39,204
LINDSEY GRAHAM LOOKED AT

149
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:40,672
THEM AND SAID YOU HAVE EVEN

150
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,506
SAID, SENATOR, THAT YOU

151
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:42,107
WANTED TO DELAY.

152
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:43,441
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM TO

153
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:43,842
GO THROUGH.

154
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:45,076
YOU WANT TO DELAY, DELAY,

155
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:46,411
DELAY AND THEN YOU WANT TO

156
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:47,846
WIN IN NOVEMBER.

157
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:48,980
KAVANAUGH ACTUALLY LOOKED AT

158
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,382
EACH OF THE DEMOCRATS AND

159
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:51,816
SAID THINGS ABOUT HIS

160
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:52,183
CHARACTER.

161
00:03:52,183 --> 00:03:53,351
HE SAID YOU CALLED ME EVIL

162
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:53,685
BEFORE.

163
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:54,786
HE SAID YOU ARE GOING TO

164
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:55,620
OPPOSE ME WITH EVERYTHING

165
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:55,987
YOU HAVE.

166
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,722
HE SAID THOSE WHO SUPPORT ME

167
00:03:57,722 --> 00:03:58,790
ARE COMPLICIT IN EVIL.

168
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,558
SOME OF YOU SAID THAT SOME

169
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:02,193
OF YOU CALLED ME YOUR WORST

170
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:02,560
NIGHTMARE.

171
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,962
HE SAID I'M A GUY WHO HAS

172
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:05,063
WORKED SO HARD MY ENTIRE

173
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:06,631
LIFE AND YOU ARE TAINTING MY

174
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:07,565
REPUTATION AND IT WILL NEVER

175
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:08,366
BE THE SAME.

176
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:09,667
>> HE IS RIGHT.

177
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,268
AINSLEY: WHAT WAS YOUR

178
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:12,003
REACTION WHEN HE WAS CALLING

179
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,038
PEOPLE OUT FACE TO FACE?

180
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:14,873
>> YOU KNOW, HE WAS SO

181
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:19,543
TRANSPARENT AND SO HONEST

182
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:20,545
AND SO RIGHT.

183
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:21,646
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ALL

184
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:22,681
NEEDED TO HEAR U WHICH IS

185
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:23,615
THE FACT THAT HE CALLED THE

186
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:24,449
DEMOCRATS OUT.

187
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,018
HE CALLED THE LIBERAL MEDIA

188
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:26,351
OUT.

189
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:26,685
WHY?

190
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:28,620
BECAUSE FOR 10 DAYS THERE

191
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,988
ARE THESE STORIES THAT HAVE

192
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:30,922
ACTUALLY BEEN OUT IN THE

193
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,457
MEDIA THAT HAVE BEEN

194
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:33,492
COMPLETELY FALSE, THAT THEY

195
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:36,061
JUST RUN WITH ON BRETT

196
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:36,428
KAVANAUGH.

197
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:37,896
GOING AS FAR AS AS BASICALLY

198
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:38,630
SAYING THAT HE IS RUNNING

199
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,465
SOME SORT OF GANG RAPE

200
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:43,201
CIRCLE IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS,

201
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:44,102
OUTRAGE JUS.

202
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:45,404
AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE HAD IS

203
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:46,905
SO MANY OF HIS FRIENDS WHO

204
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:48,106
KNEW HIM BACK THEN.

205
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:49,007
WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

206
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:50,375
THE FACT THAT DEMOCRATS ARE

207
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,778
TALKING ABOUT A HIGH SCHOOL

208
00:04:52,778 --> 00:04:54,246
YEARBOOK, ARE WE KIDDING

209
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:54,613
OURSELVES?

210
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:55,914
HOW FAR IS THIS GETTING?

211
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:57,182
AND SO FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH

212
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:59,151
TO BRING IT BACK TO WHAT

213
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:01,053
REALLY MATTERS, WHICH IS THE

214
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:05,490
SUPREME COURT, WHICH IS THIS

215
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,225
INSTITUTION OF RESPECT, OF

216
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:07,960
PROFESSIONALISM, OF THE FACT

217
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,362
THAT HE SAID THAT HE WILL BE

218
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:13,865
AN INDEPENDENT JUDGE, AND.

219
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:14,333
BRIAN: GOTCHA.

220
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,234
>> HE HAD ALL THE

221
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:16,135
QUALIFICATIONS FOR IT IT'S

222
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:17,136
HIS TIME AND TIME FOR THE

223
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:18,170
SENATE TO VOTE.

224
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,971
STEVE: WELL, AND IT LOOKS

225
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:20,139
LIKE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

226
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:21,407
IS GOING TO VOTE TODAY.

227
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:22,775
MERCEDES WE HAVE BREAKING

228
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:23,542
NEWS.

229
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:24,576
APPARENTLY FOX IS CONFIRMING

230
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:25,311
THAT THE HOUSE CONSERVATIVES

231
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:26,712
AND THE REPUBLICAN

232
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:27,446
LEADERSHIP HAVE REACHED A

233
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:29,014
DEAL TO BRING IN ROD

234
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:30,249
ROSENSTEIN TO QUESTION HIM

235
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:32,151
ABOUT THAT "NEW YORK TIMES"

236
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:32,484
ARTICLE.

237
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:33,986
NOT CLEAR IF ROSENSTEIN WILL

238
00:05:33,986 --> 00:05:35,187
RESPOND TO THE REQUEST BUT

239
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:37,489
FOX IS TOLD THE JUDICIARY

240
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:38,757
COMMITTEE AND/OR OVERSIGHT

241
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:40,326
COULD SUBPOENA HIM.

242
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:41,060
WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE

243
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,560
THINK OF THAT?

244
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,695
>> WELL, WE WILL SEE.

245
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:44,263
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE

246
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:45,998
TALKING WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN,

247
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:47,099
I BELIEVE, NEXT WEEK.

248
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,334
AND I DON'T WANT TO GET

249
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:49,868
AHEAD OF ANY OF THOSE

250
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:50,369
CONVERSATIONS.

251
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:51,103
BRIAN: THE PRESIDENT WILL BE

252
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:51,770
TALKING TO HIM NEXT WEEK?

253
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,972
>> I THINK THAT IS THE PLAN,

254
00:05:53,972 --> 00:05:54,373
YES.

255
00:05:54,373 --> 00:05:55,074
BRIAN: THEY SPOKE YESTERDAY?

256
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:56,775
>> I AM NOT AWARE.

257
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:57,743
STEVE: BUT THE PRESIDENT WAS

258
00:05:57,743 --> 00:05:58,711
BUSY WATCHING THE HEARING

259
00:05:58,711 --> 00:05:59,878
ALL DAY INSTEAD, RIGHT?

260
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:00,479
>> YES.

261
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,750
HE DID COME BACK FROM UNGLA

262
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,451
INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL TRIP

263
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,619
AND WATCHING THE HEARING.

264
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:08,287
THE PRESIDENT IS VERY PROUD

265
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:09,121
OF BRETT KAVANAUGH AS HE

266
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:10,589
MADE VERY CLEAR THIS WAS A

267
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,858
SEARCH AND DESTROY MISSION

268
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:14,026
BY THE DEMOCRATS.

269
00:06:14,026 --> 00:06:16,929
AND JUST WATCHING JUDGE JUDGE

270
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:18,064
KAVANAUGH'S POWERFUL

271
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:19,165
TESTIMONY SHARING THAT WITH

272
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:21,801
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

273
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:22,768
AINSLEY: WHAT WAS HIS

274
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:23,469
REACTION TO SENATOR GRAHAM?

275
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:24,303
DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

276
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:24,604
THAT.

277
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:26,005
>> I'M NOT AWARE.

278
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:26,973
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THE

279
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:27,340
PRESIDENT.

280
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,441
THERE WAS A MOMENT HERE

281
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:29,408
WHERE SENATOR GRAHAM REALLY

282
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:31,410
HIT A HOME RUN AND HE REALLY

283
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,345
EXPRESSED ALL THE OUTRAGE

284
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:33,846
THAT SO MANY OF US HAVE FELT

285
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:39,218
FOR SO LONG WATCHING THE

286
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:40,486
DEMOCRATS TREE TO DESTROY

287
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:40,853
KAVANAUGH.

288
00:06:40,853 --> 00:00:00,000
VERY PROUD OF WHAT SENATOR
