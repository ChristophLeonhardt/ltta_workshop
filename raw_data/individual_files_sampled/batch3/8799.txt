ROSENFELD LIVES. Reporter: THIS IS JUST A QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD. NEIGHBORS ARE SHOCKED TO HEAR THIS NEWS COME OUT ABOUT THEIR OWN NEIGHBOR, PAUL ROSENFELD. THIS IS WHERE FEDERAL PROSECUTORS SAY BETWEEN AUGUST AND OCTOBER HE WAS BUILDING A BOMB. THERE'S PUMPKINS ON THE STEPS. JUST A NORMAL NEIGHBORHOOD. THE FBI SAID HE PLANNED ON BLOWING HIMSELF UP AND OTHERS ON THE NATIONAL MALL WITH THAT BOMB IN WASHINGTON, D.C. ON ELECTION DAY 23406TH. PROSECUTORS SAY HE WANTED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO AN ALTERNATE POLITICAL THEORY. THE 56-YEAR-OLD ORDERED BLACK POWDER ONLINE AND HAD IT SHIPPED TO NEW JERSEY. HE DROVE EIGHT POUNDS OF THAT BLACK POWDER TO HIS NEW YORK BASEMENT. THAT'S WHERE HE BUILT THE BOMB OUT OF A PLYWOOD BOX. OTHER COMPONENTS WERE ADDED TO ENSURE THE BOMB WOULD KILL HIM WHEN IT EXPLODED. PROSECUTORS SAY IT APPEARED THE BOMB WAS FUNCTIONAL AND ROSENFELD TREATED HIS BASEMENT LIKE A BOMB FACTORY. HE CONDUCTED TESTS USING SMALLER BOMBS. WE SPOKE TO NEIGHBORS AND WE ALSO SPOKE TO ED, THE MAILMAN, WHO'S BEEN DELIVERING MAIL ON THIS ROUTE FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. I NEVER SUSPECTED THAT THERE WOULD BE A BOMB INSIDE THIS HOUSE. I WOULD HAVE NEVER SUSPECTED A NORMAL PLACE LIKE THIS ON A QUIET STREET WOULD BE HOME OF A MAD SCIENTIST. Reporter: ROSENFELD WAS CAUGHT, DANA, BECAUSE A PERSON WAS RECEIVING LETTERS AND TEXT MESSAGES FROM ROSENFELD. THAT PERSON SAID THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY IDEA WHO ROSENFELD WAS, BUT THAT HE WAS SENDING THEM DETAILS ABOUT THIS PLAN THAT HE WAS WANTING TO ENACT ON NOVEMBER 6TH.
