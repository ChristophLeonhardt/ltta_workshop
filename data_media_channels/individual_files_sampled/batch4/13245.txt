in a scathing 300-page report the House Oversight Committee has blasted the Obama administration and former corrupt Attorney General Eric Holder for their cover-up of The Fast and Furious gun-running scandal a scandal that was implicated in the death of an American law officer CNN responded to the report by calling for the impeachment of President Trump because he made an untoward remark to James Comey according to the house report holder and Obama's corrupt Justice Department did everything they could to withhold information from the family of Brian Terry the American lawman who was murdered by gangsters using guns which Obama's DOJ had allowed them to buy Holder regarded the grieving family of the murdered law officer as a quote nuisance even though they were grieving and the family of a law officer who was murdered by gangsters with guns that holder and Obama had allowed them to buy CNN journalists responded to the report by screaming for seven straight hours about the fact that President Trump at clumsily asked James Comey to let go of his investigation into Michael Flynn no law officers were killed in the conversation Eric Holder became the first corrupt Attorney General to ever be held in contempt of Congress for his refusal to turn over documents relating to the Fast & Furious scandal which as I may have mentioned was implicated in the murder of an American lawman who was fighting Mexican drug dealers who were using guns that Obama's DOJ had allowed to fall into their hands in the scandal that holder and Obama were covering up CNN reported on the house oversight committees finding saying quote unquote not only was Eric Holder found in contempt of Congress for his refusal to turn over documents relating to the Fast & Furious scandal a scandal which was implicated in the death of an American law officer but President Barack Obama granted holder executive privilege so that he wouldn't have to turn over documents Obama's actions served to further obstruct the investigation into the scandal which facilitated the buying of guns by Mexican gangsters who later killed an American law officer whose grieving family was deemed a nuisance by Eric Holder who was granted executive privilege by Obama so we wouldn't have to reveal the truth CNN commentators say that this amounts to obstruction of justice by Donald Trump because he made an inappropriate remark during which no one died because it was a remark not one of thousands of guns that had been sold to Mexican gangsters and then used in a shootout in which a law officer died which Eric Holder then covered up with Barack Obama's help according to CNN commentator Anderson live Face quote Donald Trump is clearly in violation of some sort of law or something and is a doodoo stinky dink who is worse than Watergate whatever that was unquote James Comey has now finished his public testimony about the Russian investigation and law officers are continuing not to die in that investigation the way they did die during fast and furious which Holder and Obama covered up this is not CNN trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right here we are

you know a lot of you are thinking about James Comey and his testimony and all that but more important than this long after James Comey will be forgotten is the fact that I mistakenly attributed to the poet William Butler Yeats yesterday a poem by WH Auden and this of course will go down in history is one of my rare rare errors but you know I was talking about Sigmund Freud and I said that Yeats had written a poem about Freud Auden wrote the poem about Freud and he also wrote an obituary poem about Yeats and that's why I got the two of them confused Auden one of the last great poets in the English language anyway I just wanted to make sure we got it all right so this is the day that the left has been waiting for right James Comey the fired FBI guy was going to get behind you know they were going to get behind the the stand in front of the Senate and he was going to testify and the Trump administration was going to be over shattered by scandal you know Trump reaping in his Oval Office before they came the police came and just lifted him out and took him away not so much of course we kind of knew this yesterday he released an opening statement that he didn't actually make in the in the Intel hearing room but he released a statement based police saying there are certain things one thing that the mainstream media got right and this is because now we know that Comey himself arranged for this to be leaked to the to the newspaper was that Comey did take a memo saying that Donald Trump had asked him for certain things he asked him for loyalty he asked him to go easy on Michael Flynn saying Michael Flynn was a good guy Michael Flynn had already been fired and basically this is you know before he had even taken off his name he's the same way I hope he can left this I hope you can let this go he didn't direct him to let it go and then I think he said it again a week or so into his presidency and but the thing that the mainstream media got wrong although it was the third thing he asked for he oh he asked for this was the big thing I think in Trump's mind he asked for Comey to go out and make a statement that he was not under investigation and this was what the mainstream media got wrong of course was that Trump said three times three times the FBI director Comey told him that he was not under any investing investigation and this turned out to be true CNN reported it wasn't true I think the Washington Post reported it wasn't true all their great anonymous sources telling other anonymous sources and then calling on the phone and reading memos over the phone all this stuff turned out not to be true Trump was right Comey told him he was not under investigation and you can you know think back remember this was right after the mainstream media who is the Democrat Party lost the election and they went insane and it was all because it had nothing to do with Hillary Clinton being a corrupt terrible candidate nothing to do with that nothing to do with a country it's sick and tired of Barack Obama's meaningless harmful policies nothing to do with any of that it all had to do with the Russians it was all about the Russian spies and they just hammered Trump with his collusion thing there was a story in The New York Times about how his his Trump's campaign people were constantly in contact with Russia Komine has now testified that that was largely untrue that they New York Times didn't know what they were talking about so all of that stuff is gone by the boards but this was the stuff it was driving Trump insane and he wanted Trump wanted Comey to come out as he had for Hillary Clinton come out and say I'm not you are not under investigation so here's the so Comey sits down for the for his testimony today and all of Washington and all of the left-wing is waiting on tenterhooks they've been waiting for weeks now Toofer Comey to dump Trump under the truck and say you tried to obstruct justice not so much play clip number two which basically put an end to the scandal director Comey did the president at any time ask you to stop the FBI investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 US elections not to my understanding now did any individual working for this administration including the Justice Department ask you to stop the Russian investigation no director when the president requested that you and I quote let Flynn go general Flynn had an unreported contact with the Russians which is a an offense and if press accounts are right there might have been discrepancies between facts and his FBI testimony in your estimation was general Flynn at that time in serious legal jeopardy and in addition to that do you sense that the president was trying to obstruct justice or just seek for a way from Mike Flynn to save face given he had already been fired the general fund at that point in time was in legal jeopardy there was an open FBI criminal investigation of his statements in connection with the Russian contacts and the contacts themselves and so that was my assessment at the time I don't think it's for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct I took it as a very disturbing thing very concerning but that's a conclusion I'm sure the Special Counsel will work towards to try and understand what the intention was there and whether that's an offense now this remember is the same guy Comey who declared that Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted something that was none of his business he declared that Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted because she had and to share classified material even though she did share classified material exposed classified material so he couldn't pronounce he can pronounce on Hillary Clinton's thinking but he couldn't pronounce on Donald Trump's thinking doesn't really matter look for the next few days as I told you yesterday for the next few days the left is going to scream and yell but this basically bursts their balloon there was that I mean he said that Donald Trump was not under investigation he said it several times he said today again Donald Trump was not under any criminal or intelligence investigation he was not implicated at all he didn't do anything he says that the special counsel can figure out whether he was trying to obstruct justice at one point he said I took this as an order but as Eric Trump is Trump's son tweeted today he said when my father orders you to do something you know you've been ordered I don't think any of us could question whether or not this is true you know I just want to give my take on this right away before we have to break we're gonna say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but before I do I just want to give my take on this because it's very rare that chris Christie speaks my mind but yesterday after the show I walked over to our new digs the new studio that's under construction and there was Michael Knowles and don't think that he was doing any construction work because the day that Michael knows does any work whatsoever will be a different day than this one but anyway he and he read me the basically the statement and everybody was talking at once and everybody was commenting and I didn't say anything but my reaction was almost exactly what Chris Christie's was here's chris Christie commenting on Donald Trump's relations and discussions with coaming so what people don't understand is that they elected an outsider president they elected someone who had never been inside government and quite frankly didn't spend a lot of time interacting with government except at the local level and so the idea of the way the tradition of these agencies is not something that he's ever been steeped in so you know I think over the course of time in the hits we could talk about different examples what you're seeing is a president who is now very publicly learning about the way people react to what he considers to be normal New York City conversation normal New York City conversation that was exactly what I thought see Trump is so used as a construction guy to dealing with New York City Democrats he didn't realize that you have to be subtle about your corruption in Washington DC because if you're a New York City Democrat you don't have to be subtle because there's no Republican Party so you just figured everyone was openly corrupt though all the officials were openly corrupt the way they are in New York this is a case of a blundering New York non-politician maneuvering with a very very slick in inside you know stiletto wielding political operative in James Comey that's what this is this is a very you know I don't mean to impugn Comey because I think it's been on the right there's been a lot of what a terrible terrible guy he is I don't think he's a terrible guy he's a political operative you don't get as high up in the government as he did without being a political operative he's a very subtle clever self-aware political operative Trump is a blundering New York guy used to working in a place where people talk a lot more bluntly than they do in the rest of the country I've had this experience with Trump number of times as a New Yorker where I thought like yeah that's kind of what I would say too but where the rest of the country goes in saying we're gonna have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but before we do we have to talk about five four and the five for Club you know we were talking earlier about looking good and guys looking good and I don't know about you but I am NOT a big shopping guy I mean I am
