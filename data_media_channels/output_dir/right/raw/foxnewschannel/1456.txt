1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,689
and get 2 months free.

2
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:23,911
>> WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO

3
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:24,311
JAMES COMEY?

4
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:24,978
>> President Trump: I WOULD

5
00:00:24,978 --> 00:00:25,679
SAY HOW IS HE GOING TO EXPLAIN

6
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,346
TO HIS GRANDCHILDREN ALL THE

7
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:27,047
LIES, DECEIT AND PROBLEMS HE'S

8
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:27,648
CAUSED IN THIS COUNTRY?

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,382
I THINK THE THINGS I'VE DONE FOR

10
00:00:28,382 --> 00:00:29,049
THIS COUNTRY, THE FIRING OF

11
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:29,816
JAMES COMEY IS GOING TO GO DOWN

12
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:30,617
AS A GOOD THING.

13
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:33,020
THE FBI IS GREAT, I KNOW SO MANY

14
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,055
PEOPLE IN THE FBI AND IT'S A

15
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:36,023
FANTASTIC INSTITUTION.

16
00:00:36,023 --> 00:00:38,425
BUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE AT THE

17
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:40,227
TOP FOR ROTTEN APPLES, JAMES

18
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:42,229
COMEY WAS ONE OF THEM.

19
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:43,397
I HAVE DONE GREAT SERVICE TO

20
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:45,766
THIS COUNTRY BY GETTING RID OF

21
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:46,333
HIM AND FIRING HIM.

22
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,436
>> SO YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM

23
00:00:49,436 --> 00:00:50,837
EXPLAINING THIS TO YOUR

24
00:00:50,837 --> 00:00:51,838
GRANDCHILDREN?

25
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:53,440
>> President Trump: NO.

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,442
THE ONE THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP

27
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:58,178
TALKING ABOUT JAMES COMEY.

28
00:00:58,178 --> 00:01:00,214
JOINING US NOW IS SEBASTIAN

29
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:04,251
GORKA, DAN BONGINO, AND

30
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,986
TAMMY BRUCE.

31
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:07,221
THE THREE OF YOU ARE GREAT

32
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:10,424
GUESTS, WE LOVE HAVING YOU ON.

33
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:13,026
BUT I WILL START WITH YOU,

34
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:15,629
BECAUSE WOMEN BEFORE MEN, YOU

35
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:16,830
UNDERSTAND THAT GUY IS.

36
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,298
SO WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG TO

37
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:22,436
GET THE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE

38
00:01:22,436 --> 00:01:23,237
TRYING TO GET?

39
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:24,838
>> THEY ARE STONEWALLING

40
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:25,305
EVERYONE.

41
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:26,840
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T HAND OVER

42
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,277
SOMETHING WHEN YOU WERE SUPPOSED

43
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:31,778
TO HAVE MORALLY SUPERIOR

44
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:32,479
FRAMEWORK.

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,047
LET'S REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT IS

46
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:39,052
THERE, IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE,

47
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:39,686
IT'S OBVIOUS.

48
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:40,787
INCLUDING ONE OF THE EARLIEST

49
00:01:40,787 --> 00:01:42,289
ONES WERE HE DECLARED THAT HIS

50
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:45,259
CAMPAIGN WAS BEING SPIED ON.

51
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,427
HE WAS MOCKED, RIDICULED AND

52
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:48,829
CLEARLY NOTE THAT NOW THAT HAS

53
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:50,230
BEEN CONFIRMED.

54
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,064
SO PEOPLE ARE UNDERESTIMATING

55
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:53,233
THE PRESIDENT, AND HE SAID

56
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,035
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND YOU

57
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:56,637
SHOULD BELIEVE HIM.

58
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:58,438
AND HE IS CORRECT.

59
00:01:58,438 --> 00:01:59,239
ESSENTIALLY THE LEAKING OF

60
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,441
MATERIAL THAT HE WROTE DOWN WITH

61
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,443
MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT, ALL

62
00:02:03,443 --> 00:02:06,046
OF THESE THINGS INDICATE A MAN

63
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:07,614
WHO HAD PROBLEMS.

64
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:09,282
I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT JOE

65
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:11,084
DIGENOVA HAS NOTED THAT THERE

66
00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:12,519
ARE INDIVIDUALS IN THE FBI WHO

67
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:15,022
WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING

68
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:16,523
ON AT THE FBI, AND THEY NEED TO

69
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:18,058
BE SUBPOENAED SO THEY HAVE

70
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:20,027
PROTECTIONS AGAINST THE AGENCY.

71
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:21,962
AND CONGRESS WILL PAY THEIR

72
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:22,362
LEGAL BILL.

73
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:26,867
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF

74
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:27,334
WHISTLE-BLOWERS.

75
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:28,568
>> Judge: SO SEBASTIAN GORKA,

76
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:30,070
CAN THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF BE

77
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,871
CLASSIFYING SOME OF THE

78
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:33,740
INFORMATION WE ARE TRYING TO GET

79
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,475
AND WILL THAT SHORT-CIRCUIT THE

80
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:36,576
WHOLE THING?

81
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:38,478
>> ABSOLUTELY.

82
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:40,080
HE HAS CLASSIFICATION AUTHORITY,

83
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,682
AND UNIQUELY HIS OWN

84
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:42,382
ADJUDICATING AGENCY AS WELL.

85
00:02:42,382 --> 00:02:46,320
WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO IS ORDER THE

86
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,387
DECLASSIFICATION OF EVERY

87
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:48,722
DOCUMENT RELATING TO THE

88
00:02:48,722 --> 00:02:49,823
CROSS FIRE HURRICANE OPERATION

89
00:02:49,823 --> 00:02:51,425
WHICH IS POLITICAL ESPIONAGE

90
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:52,125
AGAINST ANOTHER PARTY'S

91
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:52,626
CANDIDATE.

92
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:54,961
AND ON TOP OF THAT, THE MOST

93
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:57,030
IMPORTANT THING THAT HE CAN DO

94
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,032
RIGHT NOW AT THE STROKE OF A

95
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:03,236
PAN-COMPANY NEEDS TO PULL THE

96
00:03:03,236 --> 00:03:06,039
CLEARANCES OF CLAPPER, COMEY,

97
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,441
BRENNAN AND HILLARY.

98
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:10,210
WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE DOING

99
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,244
MAKING COMMENTS ON NATIONAL

100
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:13,880
TELEVISION WITH CLEARANCES AND

101
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,648
PICKING UP PAYCHECKS?

102
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:16,083
>> Judge: IF THESE PEOPLE ARE

103
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,485
NOT IN OFFICE ANYMORE AND HE

104
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:22,089
STILL HAD SECURITY CLEARANCES?

105
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:23,256
IS THAT FOR EVERYONE?

106
00:03:23,256 --> 00:03:26,693
WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE DOING WITH

107
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:29,730
CLEARANCES?

108
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,533
IS THERE A REQUIREMENT FOR A

109
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:33,934
REGULATION?

110
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:36,803
>> IT'S JUST A REGULATION.

111
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:40,941
>> Judge: SO TAKE THEIR

112
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:41,641
SECURITY CLEARANCE.

113
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:44,044
>> JUDGE, JIM TOLD ME HE IS IN A

114
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:44,644
WORLD OF TROUBLE.

115
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:46,413
HE HAS YET TO EXPLAIN WHAT I'M

116
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:47,447
CALLING PARAGRAPH ONE.

117
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,649
WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT?

118
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:51,651
WHEN I WAS A SECRET SERVICE

119
00:03:51,651 --> 00:03:53,053
AGENT I WROTE A CASE REPORT ON A

120
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:54,921
CASE IN PARAGRAPH ONE SET HOW

121
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:55,622
THAT CASE STARTED.

122
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:58,258
I RECEIVED A CALL ABOUT A STOLEN

123
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:00,460
CREDIT CARD, WHATEVER IT IS.

124
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,195
NO ONE HAS GIVEN US PARAGRAPH

125
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:05,132
ONE ON WHY THEY STARTED A

126
00:04:05,132 --> 00:04:06,233
INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION

127
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,033
AGAINST TRUMP.

128
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:10,203
POINT NUMBER TWO, THERE ARE

129
00:04:10,203 --> 00:04:12,239
FOUNDING LEAKS IN THIS CASE.

130
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,540
THERE WAS A LEAK TO

131
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,441
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" ABOUT THE

132
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,041
EXISTENCE OF THE CASE BEFORE

133
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,446
THEY CLOSED IT, AND A WEAK

134
00:04:19,446 --> 00:04:20,880
STOMACH CLICK TO

135
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,615
"THE WASHINGTON POST" ABOUT THE

136
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:23,049
INVESTIGATION BY MIKE FLYNN.

137
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:24,117
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THEY ARE

138
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:25,185
NOT THE CLASSIFYING OF A THING

139
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:27,654
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SERIOUS

140
00:04:27,654 --> 00:04:28,989
FELONY CASE AGAINST THE LEAKERS.

141
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:31,057
>> I THINK THE IRONY OF THIS IS

142
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:32,459
THEY THOUGHT THIS RUSSIAN

143
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,226
COMPLAINT WOULD BRING DOWN TRUMP

144
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:35,195
AND WHAT IT HAS DONE IS UNLOCKED

145
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:36,496
THE DOORS TO SHOW US A LEVEL OF

146
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:39,065
CORRUPTION THAT NONE OF US COULD

147
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:39,900
HAVE IMAGINED.

148
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,969
AND AGAIN, THIS IS THE RIGHT MAN

149
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:44,538
IF ANYONE HAS THE DISCIPLINE TO

150
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,339
SEE IT THROUGH TO FACE THESE

151
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:49,176
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD AN ENORMOUS

152
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:50,177
WORLDWIDE POWER, IT'S

153
00:04:50,177 --> 00:04:50,710
DONALD TRUMP.

154
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,312
SO THIS IS THE MAN NOT JUST OF

155
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:53,947
THE HOUR ABOUT A MAN OF FATE,

156
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:55,282
AND THIS IS THE TIME WHERE WE

157
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:56,783
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS

158
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:57,951
DONE.

159
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:00,120
IT'S BEING HANDED TO US.

160
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,456
AND THIS IS NONPARTISAN, EVERY

161
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:03,156
INDIVIDUAL HAS TO CARE

162
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:04,991
REGARDLESS OF YOUR PARTY

163
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:06,793
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU THINK OF

164
00:05:06,793 --> 00:05:07,227
THE PRESIDENT.

165
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:09,129
>> Judge: SEBASTIAN, I ONLY

166
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:10,397
HAVE 15 SECONDS LEFT.

167
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:13,867
IF THIS IS THE CASE AND IF THIS

168
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:15,502
THING WAS STARTED AND THEY HAVE

169
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:17,204
LIED -- WHILE I'M NOT GOING TO

170
00:05:17,204 --> 00:05:18,605
SAY THEY'VE LIED BUT THEY HAVE

171
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:19,606
SO MANY DIFFERENT STARTING

172
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:20,040
POINTS.

173
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,812
FIRST IT WAS JULY, THEN IT WAS

174
00:05:25,812 --> 00:05:26,146
SPRING.

175
00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:26,746
WHEN WILL THIS BE OVER?

176
00:05:26,746 --> 00:05:28,148
WILL THEY TRY TO GET IN IN

177
00:05:28,148 --> 00:05:29,983
NOVEMBER AND APPEASE THE

178
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,350
PRESIDENT?

179
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,418
>> I THINK ROBERT MUELLER WILL

180
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:32,819
TRY TO DROP A REPORT THAT WILL

181
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:35,589
BE USED AS A POLITICAL WEAPON IN

182
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:35,622
BE USED AS A POLITICAL WEAPON II

183
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:36,389
BE USED AS A POLITICAL WEAPON IN

184
00:05:36,389 --> 00:00:00,000
THE MIDTERM, ABSOLUTELY.
