the center-left social-democrats have been the biggest party in every Swedish election for a century true again this time but not by far and it's a relief it's been their worst result ever this is an election that seems support shift from the center to the extremes coalition building will be tough one big winner has been the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats though not as big as they'd hoped the story of the night is that while the far-right has become a force in Swedish politics they won't be taking over just yet what we've seen is the political earthquake rindu blocks the swedish political history and i think that the leaders of the two big parties the social democrats and the moderate party need to listen to this signal from the swedish people need to change the policies people want to see the rise of the far-right in Sweden meant voters took to the election with customary enthusiasm even if many harbored deep concerns terrible I just want to cry when I think about it they say awful things I mean yeah of course we have a lot of refugees here but we need to take care of them they come from terrible place terrible wars we can't just throw them out immigration and integration have been front and center in a divisive vote with this country's famous values of tolerance and openness at stake so Sweden isn't in danger of becoming a far-right State and nor are the Sweden Democrats even likely to make it into government no party at this stage will even talk to them but they are likely to continue to exert an indirect influence on the way ahead having already succeeded to the horror of many in putting nationalism and identity politics on the swedish agenda peter wolodarsky is editor in chief of one of Sweden's major daily newspapers the town has already changed it has changed a lot and I think the major change came in 2015 after the big refugee crisis a lot of refugees came in to Sweden in a very short time span and the systems here didn't work properly and a lot of people reacted to that and the Sweden Democrats are sort of logical consequences well they searched in the polls as a result of that crisis and they've stayed on that kind of result since some Swedes will tell you the rise of the far right is overblown that this country has never been happier or more prosperous but extreme politics are in Sweden to stay now and many other Suites see trouble ahead Jonah hull al-jazeera Stockholm
