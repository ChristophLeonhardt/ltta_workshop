>> Shannon: THANKS.
WE WILL FOCUS ON 3 KEY TIGHT
MID-TERM RACES WITH FOX NEWS
POLITICS EDITOR CHRIS AND THE
AUTHOR OF THE NEW BEST SELLER.
EVERY MAN A CROWN.
ARE YOU GOING TO SHOW UP IN A
CROWN?
>> I DO.
BUT THEY MAKE ME TAKE IT OFF.
YOU ARE THE ROYALTY HERE.
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT
NORTH CAROLINA.
DISTRICT 9.
>> NO QUESTION THAT YOU KNOW HOW
CLOSE THE REPUBLICAN CONTROL OF
THE HOUSE IS BEING.
IF THEY INVEST THIS MUCH EFFORT.
NORTH CAROLINA DOESN'T HAVE A
SENATE RACE.
THEY DON'T HAVE A GUBERNATORIAL
RACE.
IT'S 1 OF 435 HOUSE RACES.
YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT AND
VICE-PRESIDENT GOING DOWN TO
SAVE THIS SEAT.
ONE OF THE ARE THE THINGS ABOUT
THIS, JUST AS BARACK OBAMA
FOUND, YOU CAN'T GO EVERYWHERE.
THERE IS A LIMITED NUMBER OF
PLACES.
THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME FOR
DONALD TRUMP TO BE IN OHIO OR IN
PENNSYLVANIA.
HE TOOK A MOVE INTO PENNSYLVANIA
BEFORE.
HIS NUMBERS ARE LOW.
WHERE HE IS NOT SO POPULAR
ANYMORE.
NORTH CAROLINA WILL INCREASE
DEMOCRAT INTENSITY BUT THERE ARE
ENOUGH REPUBLICANS OUT THERE.
>> Shannon: LET'S TURN TO
FLORIDA.
THIS NEW POLL, THEY HAVE THIS IN
A DEAD HEAT.
THE SENATE RACE.
GOVERNOR SCOTT AND SENATOR
NELSON.
>> IN THE AVERAGE SENATOR NELSON
HAS BEEN AHEAD 5 TO 6 POINTS.
THIS IS THE FIRST POLL THAT WE
HAVE SEEN IN QUITE A WHILE THAT
HAS THE RACE CLOSE.
IT WAS CLOSE ONCE AND SCOTT HAD
AN ADVANTAGE IN THE EARLY GOING.
WE WILL WAIT AND SEE.
IS THIS POLL AN OUT LIER OR THE
BEGINNING OF A TREND?
FOR SCOTT HE NEEDS TO, TO BE
STARTING A TREND NOW.
WITH EARLY VOTING ALREADY GOING
ON.
THE TIME IS RUNNING OUT QUICKLY.
>> Shannon: THAT'S A STATE WHERE
THERE ARE BIG THINGS ON THE GAL
ON THE.
-- BALLOTS.
THE GOVERNOR'S RACE.
THAT FACTORS INTO WHO TURNS OUT.
>> AND A STATE THAT LIKES TO
DECIDE ELECTIONS NARROWLY.
>> Shannon: MICHIGAN AS WELL.
WE HAVE A 4-TERM INCUMBENT
THERE.
JOHN JAMES THIS BUSINESS OWNER
AND A MILITARY GUY.
HE WAS DOWN 33 POINTS IN
SEPTEMBER.
THIS NEW POINT SAYS 7.
IS THERE A SHOT FOR THE GOP?
>> THERE IS ALWAYS A SHOT.
BAYLOR DOWN 50 MIGHT HAVE WON.
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
THIS IS A POLL FOR THE DETROIT
NEWS.
THE RACES HAVE TIGHTENED.
BILL THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR
GOVERNOR.
BOTH RACES ARE CLOSE.
I WOULD TELL EVERYBODY THIS.
AS YOU GET CLOSER TO THE END,
UNDECIDED VOTERS LIE.
SOME PEOPLE FLATTER THEMSELVES
AND SAY I MIGHT CHANGE MY MIND.
NAME IDENTIFICATION FOR THE
CANDIDATES GO UP AND PEOPLE
RETURN TO THEIR PARTISAN ROOTS.
WHETHER OR NOT JAMES HAS ENOUGH
MOJO.
HE IS A VERY GOOD CANDIDATE.
A DYNAMIC CANDIDATE.
IN A DIFFERENT YEAR HE MIGHT BE
IN A BETTER CONDITION.
