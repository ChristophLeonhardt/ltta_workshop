Dave 407 of the Trump administration President Trump is at his Florida resort after a week of extraordinary turbulence that seems to signify a deepening crisis than some of the previous rocky weeks in this White House to begin the Russia investigation appears to have taken on a new kind of momentum today NBC News learned Robert Muller wants to know if Jared Kushner's business dealings with foreign nationals during the transition ended up influencing the administration's policies that comes amid other NBC news reports this week that the special counsel also wants to know what Donald Trump knew about the release of stolen DNC emails and that Muller is looking at criminal charges for Russians who carried out hacking and leaking of information to hurt the Democrats back in 2016 news that the Muller investigation may include determined focus on the president and the senior advisor who happens to be his son-in-law comes during what appears to be an implosion of the West Wing power center of Jared Kushner Ivanka Trump and White House communications director hope Hicks who of course resigned suddenly on Wednesday earlier today our colleague Nicole Wallace detailed the cascade of events involving Jared Kushner that set in motion his downfall witnessing Jared Kushner's two-week collapse has been like watching a play at least that's how Jim VandeHei from Axio sees it and the whole ordeal breaks it down into five acts first act one the kneecapping it all started when Kushner lost his top-secret security clearance a critical blow to someone with so many responsibilities back to the humiliation on Tuesday The Washington Post reported foreign governments discussed ways to manipulate Kushner then Act three The Godfather turns Kushner's mentor Rupert Murdoch tones The Wall Street Journal and on Wednesday their editorial board suggested the knives were out and that Kushner should step down Act four is called the plot that same day the New York Times reported Kushner's family businesses received loans after White House meetings then act 5 and this might be the most consequential when it comes to Kushner's job security Orchard Trump The Times reporting Trump is frustrated with Kushner who he now sees as a liability well further according to the Washington Post the president isn't happy about all the attention his son-in-law is getting and has raised questions about Jared and Ivanka's future the Post tells it this way the president quote also mused this week that everything might be better for them if they simply gave up their government jobs and returned to New York according to a White House official who has discussed it with him New York Times of course goes further reporting Trump has discussed their departure from the White House with the White House chief of staff and the president tries to navigate family issues he is also attempting to deal with policy issues of course at the same time among the more pressing what to do about gun violence in our country it's been more than two weeks now since the parklands shootings not only as the White House no closer to any new legislation on guns the president nearly sent his party into shock when he made these remarks earlier this week take the firearms first and then go to court that takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures I like taking the guns early take the guns first go through due process second he didn't stop there the very next day mr. Trump seemed to go against everything Republican party had preached about trade when he threatened sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum that is not the kind of thing you want to spring on the chairman of say the Senate Finance Committee especially when it happens to be Republican senator Orrin Hatch of Utah the people are going to have to pay these tariffs are going to be the Americans citizens and frankly we don't we don't win by assessing tariffs I don't know who's advising them but I I have a pretty good idea but the fact of the matter is it's the wrong advice so you see how that went it is almost impossible to know what next week will bring from this White House but earlier today in this very same studio on this network former CIA chief John Brennan shared this it's no secret to anybody that Donald Trump was ill prepared and an unexperienced in terms of dealing with matters that a head of state needs to do without a government and I think this is now coming to roost if we have somebody in the Oval Office who is unstable inept inexperienced and also unethical we really have rough waters ahead that gets your attention and for more let's bring in our leadoff panel on a Friday night Peter Baker chief White House correspondent for The New York Times and an MSNBC political analyst Julia Ainsley NBC News national security and justice reporter and david jolly former GOP member of congress from the great state of florida Peter I'd like to begin with you while stating clearly Mara Lago rules are now in effect and by that of course we mean the president enters the warm bath of family friends and paying guests who form the kind of tableau the backdrop and can sometimes inform his thinking and his Twitter habits no that's exactly right he's there tonight for one night only he's not staying the whole weekend he's coming back to Washington tomorrow for a different kind of dinner that dinner will be with the enemy of the American people the media the gridiron dinner each year he skipped it last year this year he's going to go and that's a gonna be interesting affair where the president knighted States is roasted by some of the members the media that he has engaged with in such an interesting way in the last year so it'll be fun well funs nothing rightward he'll be able to see how that goes having attended and escape that dinner I can report their motto is to singe and never burn so we'll see if they remain true to that when the president attends hey Julia can you run us through the kind of cheat sheet version of what we learned today along the lines of Muller and Kushner yeah that's right really what we're doing here is we're connecting two things were saying that Muller is now looking into this we've known for some time that Jared Kushner had some questionable overseas business dealings we've also known for some time that there was concern about how he was running business in the White House what we're saying today is that Muller is looking into whether or not those business dealings with people from for example Turkey and Qatar influence his decision-making in the White House and a chief example of that Brian that just kind of clears it all up and brings it home is the idea that he met with a man named is known as H BJ they met in December of 2016 during the presidential transition when Kushner was trying to secure financing for that very over-leveraged in debt six sixes Fifth Avenue real estate development that he had in New York and that deal went south hbj pulled out the financing and as a result the Qataris believe a Kushner then retaliated and he was behind they believe the decision of President Trump to then endorsed the blockade against Qatar by its Gulf Coast neighbors now of course Kushner would say that that is not why that policy went to place at all but there's obviously a belief that there's some sort of retaliation or favoritism going on from Jared Kushner influencing White House policy as a result of these business dealings and that's something that molar wants to look at him yeah John Heilemann was on this broadcast and with Nicole Wallace yesterday repeating that so much of this is going to in his view come down to this one address six six six Fifth Avenue in in Manhattan you could throw a stone at it from here but let's not congressman what looking back over the scope of this week which is not insignificant we're going to go into some detail later in the hour what was the most notable event to you the national security implications you know Brian it's easy to equate so many of these controversies but we have to look at the developments in the cushion or investigation and we can't overlook the statements by Vladimir Putin that just during this week the head of Russia suggested that he has been able to undermine nearly 30 years of American national security strategy and what did we hear from Donald Trump we saw him not respond to Russia but instead criticized Saturday Night Live and Alec Baldwin we saw him launch the initial volleys of a trade war we saw me privately with the NRA to walk back statements he's increasingly surrounding himself by staff under investigation or perhaps indictment including his own family his chief of staff has suggested he made a deal with the devil his economic adviser isn't sure much how much longer he can last as Attorney General has had to pledge his loyalty to the Constitution over the president you have a VA secretary and a HUD secretary who are under investigation for financial impropriety and it affirms Brennan's comments earlier today that has there probably has not ever been in modern presidential history so someone's so unprepared to take the reins of the office of the presidency and it matters because it has national security consequences and perhaps already has hey there are Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out
