PENINSULA. OUR OWN GREG PALKOT IS IN SEOUL WITH THE LATEST. HI, GREG. HI, ELIZABETH. IT IS THE DAY AFTER THAT HISTORIC INTERKOREAN SUMMIT THAT INVOLVED OF COURSE BETWEEN KIM JONG-UN AND SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON JAE-IN. PROBABLY MOST SIGNIFICANT WAS THE REACTION FROM THE NORTH. THERE WAS COVERAGE TODAY OF THE SUMMIT IN STATE-CONTROLLED TV AND IN NEWSPAPERS AND THEY INCLUDED MENTION OF NORTH KOREA'S PLEDGE TO GET RID OF ITS NUKES, THEY ACTUALLY USED THE WORLD TO THEIR PUBLIC, DENUCLEARIZATION. HERE IN SEOUL, CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM, ESPECIALLY THAT COMMITMENT TO SIGN A PEACE TREATY TO FORMALLY END THE KOREAN WAR, THAT'S GONE ON FOR SO MANY YEARS NOW AND OTHER MEASURES TO EASE THE TENSIONS ACROSS THE BORDER. THE MEETING ON FRIDAY WAS ALSO SEEN AS AN IMPORTANT WARM-UP FOR THE PLANNED SUMMIT BETWEEN KIM JONG-UN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE PRESIDENT TWEETED THIS TODAY, JUST HAD A LONG AND VERY GOOD TALK ABOUT PRESIDENT MOON IN SOUTH KOREA, THINGS ARE GOING VERY WELL, TIME AND LOCATION OF MEETINGS IS BEING SET. AND ALSO SPOKE TO PRIME MINISTER ABE OF JAPAN TO INFORM HIM OF ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS. HERE IS THE TAKE OF ONE ANALYST ABOUT THAT UPCOMING SUMMIT. TAKE A LISTEN. I SEE A GOOD POSSIBILITY OF GOOD CHEMISTRY BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN, THEY'RE UNCONVENTIONAL FIGURES AND PRIZE INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS SO I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE WHEN THEY GET IN THAT ROOM, DONALD TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN CAN MAKE A DEAL. WE WILL SEE. JUST IN THE PAST COUPLE OF MINUTES, ELIZABETH, WE'VE GOTTEN WORD THAT DEFENSE SECRETARY MATTIS HAS SPOKEN WITH HIS COUNTERPART IN SOUTH KOREA IN THE WAKE OF THE SUMMIT TALKING ABOUT A RANGE OF ISSUES. ONE MORE NOTE, ANALYST DOES GIVE A LOT OF CREDIT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR GETTING TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA TO THIS POINT, BUT HE WARNS, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE, JUST BEGINNING THE PROCESS AND THAT PROCESS, AT LEAST A FEW TIMES IN THE PAST, HAS GONE
