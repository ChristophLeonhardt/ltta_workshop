round-the-world cyclists couple who wrote of kind loving people in travel blog Jay Austin and Lauren gagin were sick of their office jobs and their normal American life so they decided to see the world in fact they wanted to see a part of the world that was frequented less often by Westerners and sees something completely different and new and as the New York Times explained they had a great experience they traveled to Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan one day a Kazakh man stopped his truck and handed them ice creams another day two girls met them at the top of a mountain and handed them bouquets of flowers this was the ideal ik life they wanted Jay even told the press that he didn't believe in evil he said people the narrative goes are not to be trusted people are bad people are evil I don't buy it evil is a make-believe concept we've invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own by and large humans are kind self-interested sometimes myopic sometimes but kind by and large yes but that doesn't mean all and those who aren't would fit into that evil category which he denied existed and perhaps their journey proves their theory up until the harsh truth about humanity hit home it was on July 20 9360 ninth day of their trip that the couple were cycling with a group of other tourists in Tajikistan a carload of men turned up he will have since been identified as Islamic state fanatics and rammed into the bikers and then stabbed them cellphone footage shows the driver speeding past these cyclists making a u-turn and ramming straight into them four people were killed including the American couple this is the harsh truth of humanity and the world this story is so tragic but it also serves as a lesson evil does exist in cultures are not all equal some cultures incurred the murder of innocent people some cultures encourage the punishment of murders so if these cultures are all equal then what is humanity this isn't the first time this has happened either there was the famous story of PIPA a performance artist who hitchhike from Italy to the Balkans and to the Middle East in an attempt to spread a message of peace she called it a marriage between different peoples and nations but she was soon raped and killed by a man who offered her a ride home these are the kinds of people who would tell us that profiling is racist and that closing our borders is discriminatory we're told so often that everyone is the same all cultures are equal and borders are arbitrary but with all the evidence the very real fact that Mexican drug cartels exist and that they frequently murder and rape innocent people the very real fact that Isis exists and murders non-believers without a moment of thought and the very real fact that many cultures out there hate the mere existence of the West I just don't buy that we are all equal world peace would be nice but we have to be realistic about it some people hate us and evil does exist if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
