00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,348

WHAT WE DO AS CRIMESTOPPERS WE 

94
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:40,820

IT HELPS THE COMMUNITY. 

101
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,896
ONE THING WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND 

102
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:54,934
IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE 

103
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,504
TO GET HER BACK TO GET THIS 

104
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,239
THING BEYOND OUR COMMUNITIES IF

106
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,309

115
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,624

WE DO NOT EXIST FOR THOSE

INCREDIBLE INVESTIGATION. 

187
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:45,838
IT'S LARGE, IT'S SOPHISTICATED, 

188
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:46,939
IT'S AGGRESSIVE AND THEY HAVE 

189
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,976
BEEN NOTHING BUT SENSITIVE TO 

190
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,076
OUR FAMILY AND TO SUGGEST 

191
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:51,844
OTHERWISE IS WRONG. 

192
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,246
BUT THEY ARE NOT SHARING 

193
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,280
INFORMATION WITH US BECAUSE 

194
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,581
THEY DON'T NEED TO SHARE 

195
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,382
INFORMATION WITH SOMEONE WHO 

196
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,552
MIGHT BE I AM INDICATED IN 

197
00:06:59,552 --> 00:06:59,752
THIS. 

198
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,988
THE OTHER PART IS YOU, THE 

199
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:02,255
MEDIA. 

200
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:02,755
YOU'VE BEEN WONDERFUL. 

201
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,590
YOU'VE TAKEN OUR STORY NATIONAL 

202
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,559
AND INTERNATIONAL AND TO KEEP 

203
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,630
THIS STORY AND THE PUBLIC 

204
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,497
CONSCIENCE IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE 

205
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,900
THIS IS GOING TO BE SOLVED BY 

206
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,669
SOMEONE COMING FORWARD WITH 

207
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,403
INFORMATION, EITHER INFORMATION 

208
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,739
THEY THINK IS TRIVIAL AND NOT 

209
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,339
WORTH SHARING OR INFORMATION 

210
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,874
THEY THINK IS GOING TO I AM 

211
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,111
INDICATE A LOVED ONE OR A 

212
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:25,745
FRIEND AND ARE AFRAID OF DOING 

213
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:26,579
THAT AND I'VE BEEN TELLING ALL 

214
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,782
OF YOU IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO 

215
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,750
HIDE YOU HAVE NOTHING FEAR SO 

216
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,021
COME FORWARD, SHARE THAT 

217
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:35,721
INFORMATION WITH THE 

218
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:36,989
AUTHORITIES AND LET'S BRING 

219
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:37,857
MOLLY HOME. 

220
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:41,394
AND THIS IS ANOTHER TOOL IN OUR 

221
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,663
ARSENAL PROVIDING THIS FUND TO 

222
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,197
PROVIDE SOME FINANCIAL 

223
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:47,600
INCENTIVE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS 

224
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,167
OTHERWISE RELUCTANT TO COME 

225
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,902
FORWARD AND IF YOU CAN GET THIS 

226
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,138
STORY OUT, THEN MAYBE WE CAN 

227
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,638
BRING MOLLIE HOME AND WE'LL ALL 

228
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:56,342
HAVE A HAPPY ENDING TO THIS. 

229
00:07:56,342 --> 00:08:00,179
>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT 

230
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,214
THAT SHE WENT FROM $2,000 TO-- 

231
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:06,319
>> I THINK IT'S A TESTAMENT TO 

232
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,388
ALL OF THE MEDIA AND YOUR 

233
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,289
ABILITY TO GET THIS OUT. 

234
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,459
IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE TO PARTNER 

235
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,496
WITH THE MEDIA TO GET THIS 

236
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,796
STORY OUT AND HUMANIZE MOLLIE. 

237
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:19,498
SHE ISN'T ALL THAT MORE 

238
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:22,868
DIFFERENT THAN YOUR DAUGHTERS 

239
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:24,403
OR SISTERS OR GIRLFRIEND. 

240
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,438
SHE'S JUST A WONDERFUL NORMAL 

241
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:32,578
TERRIFIC PERSON AND WE ALL CAN 

242
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:33,345
IDENTIFY WITH THAT. 

243
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:35,147
SO LET'S BRING HER HOME. 

244
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,451
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO KEEP 

245
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:43,589
THIS STORY IN THE PUBLIC 

246
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,423
CONSCIENCE IS ESSENTIAL. 

247
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:49,629
>> IS THERE A WAY TO DETERMINE 

248
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,630
THE FURTHEST DONATION FROM OVER 

249
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,896
SEAS? 

250
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:53,231
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THE AMOUNT 

251
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:54,200
IS ESSENTIAL. 

252
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,768
IT'S AS MUCH THE INCENTIVE IS 

253
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:59,271
ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE CAN USE 

254
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:05,511
ACROSS THE STREET FROM HERE THE 

255
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,044
COMMUNITY IS CREATING 

256
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,413
COLLATERAL T-SHIRTS, BUTTONS, 

257
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,882
PINS AND YARD SIGNS WITH THAT 

258
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,316
TIP NUMBER ON. 

259
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,351
AND SO WE CAN ONLY FIGHT THAT 

260
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:12,652
WAY. 

261
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,721
SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING. 

262
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,356
AND LAURA PUT TOGETHER THIS 

263
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:17,556
FUND. 

264
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:19,258
WE'VE BEEN ON A SUPPORT TRACK 

265
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,427
TRYING TO WORK WITH YOU TO HELP 

266
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,728
YOU GET THIS STORY OUT. 

267
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,966
SO WE WAKE UP EVERY DAY AT 2 OR 

268
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,568
3 IN THE MORNING TO FIGHT AND 

269
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:32,672
LAURA IS FIGHTING THE BOYS ARE 

270
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:32,939
FIGHTING. 

271
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:33,372
DALTON IS FIGHTING. 

272
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,006
EVERYBODY IN THIS COMMUNITY IS 

273
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:39,745
FIGHTING TO GET HER BACK AND 

274
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,649
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY HELPFUL. 

275
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,885
>> THE NEW SIGHTING JUST 

276
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,653
ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY, WHAT DOES 

277
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,854
THAT GET YOU AS A LEAD? 

278
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:53,859
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE 

279
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,628
TALKING ABOUT. 

280
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,396
>> THERE WAS A SIGHTING 

281
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:57,997
[INAUDIBLE] 

282
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,131
THERE WAS A SIGHTING IN 

283
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,766
MISSOURI THAT THEY THOUGHT 

284
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,901
COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE THAT 

285
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,369
MATCHED THE DESCRIPTION BUT WE 

286
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,404
ARE LEARNING THAT IT'S NOT HER. 

287
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,273
>> I THINK YOU RAISE A GOOD 

288
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:07,606
POINT. 

289
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,575
PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT BECAUSE 

290
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:13,879
THEY THINK IT'S IRRELEVANT OR 

291
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,146
TRIVIAL. 

292
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:14,679
NOTHING IS IRRELEVANT AND 

293
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,147
NOTHING IS TRIVIAL. 

294
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,083
THE AUTHORITIES HAVE TOLD US 

295
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,184
THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO SORT 

296
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:18,784
OUT WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S 

297
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,953
WRONG SO IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING 

298
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,322
THAT'S EITHER TRIVIAL OR 

299
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,091
SOMETHING THAT EITHER COULD 

300
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,258
POTENTIALLY I AM APPLICABLE ATE 

301
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,993
SOMEONE YOU KNOW OR LOVE COME 

302
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:28,927
FORWARD WITH THE INFORMATION. 

303
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:34,767
AUTHORITIES CAN SORT THAT OUT 

304
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,401
AND DO IT QUICKLY. 

305
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:41,674
>> WELL THE LAST ONE THAT WE 

306
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:47,012
PARTICIPATED IN WAS ACTUALLY 

307
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:47,813
OAKLAND BACK IN 2051. 

308
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,482
FORTUNATELY WE DON'T GET THIS 

309
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,549
OPPORTUNITY AND ALL OF THIS 

310
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:55,321
THEY WERE SAYING THAT THE MONEY 

311
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,623
CAN BE AN INCENTIVE FOR 

312
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,759
SOMEBODY TO STEP UP. 

313
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,728
ESPECIALLY POSSIBLY DOING SOME 

314
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,162
OTHER THINGS MONTELL. 

315
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:07,299
BUT THE KEY PART IS WE CAN 

316
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:07,933
GUARANTY THEIR IDENTITY. 

317
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,201
WHAT I EXPLAINED BEFORE WE 

318
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,636
COULDN'T TELL YOU WHO THEY WERE 

319
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,439
EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO TELL WHO 

320
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:13,739
THEY WERE. 

321
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:17,710
THAT'S CRUCIAL FROM AS FAR AS 

322
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,443
THE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE WHO 

323
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:20,713
DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED FEEL 

324
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:21,814
LIKE IF I SAY SOMETHING THEY 

325
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,883
ARE GOING TO TALK TO ME OR IN 

326
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,152
CASES IN THE PAST WHERE WE'VE 

327
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,720
HAD MOTHERS TURN IN SONS, 

328
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,688
FAMILY MEMBERS TURN IN OTHER 

329
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,222
FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY ARE 

330
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:30,855
OUT OF CONTROL. 

331
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:32,625
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT 

332
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,692
UNLESS THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY 

333
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,694
SURE THAT THEIR IDENTITY WOULD 

334
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,129
BE PROTECTED AND THAT'S A 

335
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,098
CRUCIAL PART WHAT CRIME STOPPER 

336
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:39,565
DOES. 

337
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,399
WE ARE THE SAFETY NET. 

338
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,967
LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES A GREAT 

339
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:42,167
JOB. 

340
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,269
MOST OF THE COMMUNITY, PUBLIC 

341
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,905
IS NOT AFRAID TO GET INVOLVED. 

342
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,139
WE EXIST FOR THAT SMALL 

343
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,644
MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC THAT 

344
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,214
WOULD NEVER PARTICIPATE UNLESS 

345
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,448
THEY WOULD GUARANTY THEIR 

346
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:56,715
IMMUNITY. 

347
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,851
>> HOW OFTEN ABOUT HAVE YOU 

348
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,886
SEEN THESE CASES TURN INTO A 

349
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,153
SUCCESS? 

350
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,223
>> WELL LOCALLY WE HAVEN'T HAD 

351
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,456
A LOT. 

352
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:06,058
I KNOW I SERVED ON THE BOARD 

353
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:06,658
NATIONALLY SEVERAL YEARS AGO 

354
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:09,161
AND THERE ARE STORIES ALL OVER 

355
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,797
THE PLACE WHERE THE AMOUNT OF 

356
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,766
MONEY DID GET SOMEBODY'S 

357
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,301
ATTENTION AND THEY DID COME 

358
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,302
FORWARD BECAUSE THEY WERE 

359
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,536
CONFIDENT THEY COULD COME 

360
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,638
FORWARD AND BE PROTECTED AND 

361
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,106
NOBODY WOULD KNOW WHO THEY ARE. 

362
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:23,408
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF 

363
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:24,910
DYNAMICS WE ARE GOING TO SHAKE 

364
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,444
THE TREE. 

365
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,946
WE WANT SOMEBODY TO COME 

366
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,380
FORWARD EVEN IF IT'S NOT REAL 

367
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,952
AT LEAST TO START A 

368
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:33,519
CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY. 

369
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,321
SOMEBODY MIGHT KNOW THAT SHE'S 

370
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,322
BEING HELD BY SOMEBODY BUT 

371
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,423
WOULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING 

372
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,057
BECAUSE IF THEY SAID SOMETHING 

373
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:41,260
THEY MAY THINK THAT THEIR LIFE 

374
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,162
MIGHT BE IN DANGER. 

375
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,297
WE CAN GUARANTY THAT WHOEVER 

376
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,199
GIVES THIS INFORMATION UP THEIR 

377
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,534
IDENTITY WILL BE PROTECTED. 

378
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,769
>> HOW WOULD THEY GET THE 

379
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,003
MONEY? 

380
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,504
>> THEY'LL GET--WHEN THEY PUT 

381
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:55,274
IN THE TIP THEY GET A RANDOM 

382
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,676
NUMBER THAT MATCHES THAT TIP SO 

383
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,745
IF YOU ARE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 THEY'D 

384
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,481
HAVE TO CONTACT US BACK AND SAY 

385
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,651
HEY I SAW IN THE MEDIA--WELL IN 

386
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,453
THIS CASE IF THEY GOT THEM I 

387
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,321
WANT TO LET HER GO AND THAT 

388
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,856
NEGOTIATION WILL BE DONE WITH 

389
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,759
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND A WHOLE 

390
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,094
NEW DYNAMIC WILL COME INTO PLAY 

391
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,828
AND WE HOPE THAT DYNAMIC COMES 

392
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:17,128
INTO PLAY. 

393
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:26,505
THAT'S WHY WE ARE DOING WHAT WE 

394
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,639
ARE DOING. 

395
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,944
>> TALK TO US ABOUT THE 

396
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:32,211
PROCESS. 

397
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,146
>> I WASN'T--EXCUSE ME. 

398
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,883
I WASN'T THE MAIN--IT WAS A 

399
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,151
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN 

400
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,220
STEVE RHODES AND I. AND I HAD 

401
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,122
BEEN GETTING E-MAILS I BELIEVE 

402
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,992
THROUGH THE BANK THAT THERE WAS 

403
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,525
MONEY SITTING OUT THERE. 

404
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:50,663
ROB AND I--ROB STILL LIVES IN 

405
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:50,963
CALIFORNIA. 

406
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,097
ROB AND I LIVED IN CALIFORNIA. 

407
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:59,038
WE HAVE A TON OF FRIENDS THERE 

408
00:13:59,038 --> 00:13:59,638
AND PEOPLE WERE GETTING ANGRY 

409
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,105
AS OF THREE DAYS AGO. 

410
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,841
STEVE AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING 

411
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,611
ON THIS ABOUT THREE DAYS AGO. 

412
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,312
WE HAVE MONEY, WE HAVE 

413
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:11,784
SUBSTANTIAL MONEY AND WE WANT 

414
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,084
TO HELP. 

415
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:15,754
SO THE REWARD FUND WAS EASY 

416
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,523
ENOUGH TO GET SET-UP BUT AS 

417
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,257
THROUGH ALL PROCESSES 

418
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:18,824
ESPECIALLY WHEN MONEY IS 

419
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:22,828
INVOLVED WE HAD TO WORK WITH 

420
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,196
LAWYERS AND JUST BE SURE 

421
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,831
EVERYTHING WAS WHERE IT SHOULD 

422
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:27,066
BE. 

423
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,635
BUT IT WAS JUST--IT WAS JUST 

424
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:31,804
FLYING BY THE SEAT OF YOUR 

425
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,772
PANTS BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SET-UP 

426
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,474
A REWARD FUND FOR MY DAUGHTER 

427
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,977
BEFORE AND IF IT WASN'T FOR 

428
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,812
STEVE, HE AND I WORKING 

429
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,214
TOGETHER, I COULDN'T HAVE DONE 

430
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:42,681
IT. 

431
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,483
SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, 

432
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:45,985
THEY'LL TAKE YOUR NEXT 

433
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:46,252
QUESTION. 

434
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,753
>> TWO WEEKS ON JUST TELL US 

435
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,487
HOW WE ARE GETTING BY DAY-TO-

436
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:53,692
DAY AND WHAT YOU ARE DOING 

437
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,660
MORNING, NOON AND NIGHT JUST TO 

438
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:01,033
LOOK FOR HER AND GET THROUGH 

439
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:01,366
THIS EMOTION. 

440
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:06,972
>> EVERY DAY I FEEL MOLLY'S 

441
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,507
PRESENCE AND SOMETIMES I FEEL 

442
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,644
HER SITTING ON MY SHOULDER. 

443
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,145
AND MOLLIE WAS AN INCREDIBLY 

444
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:14,612
STRONG YOUNG WOMAN. 

445
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:17,516
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE 

446
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:21,253
THE STRENGTH IN ME BUT MOLLIE'S 

447
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,621
LENDING ME HER STRENGTH EVERY 

448
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,924
DAY EVERY NIGHT AND YES I HAVE 

449
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:31,563
MY MOMENTS OF COMPLETE 

450
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:31,864
MELTDOWNS. 

451
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,265
BUT IT IS THROUGH THIS STRENGTH 

452
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:39,605
THAT SOMEHOW AND I DON'T KNOW 

453
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:46,679
HOW BEING BEING BE KNOWED UPON 

454
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,482
ME EVERY MORNING, EVERY NOON, 

455
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,616
EVERY NIGHT. 

456
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,318
>> IF NOBODY CLAIMS THE REWARD 

457
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:53,986
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FUND. 

458
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,821
>> WHAT WE PUT TOGETHER WAS 

459
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:56,989
THOSE FUNDS THAT OWNERS WOULD 

460
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,858
HAVE A CHASE THROUGH THE 

461
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,127
PROCESS TO MAKE IT THROUGH TO 

462
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:02,628
MAKE IT BACK. 

463
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,999
IF NOT THE FUNDS WOULD THEN 

464
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,666
ROLL INTO MOLLIE TIBBETTS 

465
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,667
FAMILY AND WITH CRIMESTOPPERS 

466
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,335
AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME A 

467
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:11,637
DECISION WOULD BE MADE WHETHER 

468
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,640
IT BE A MEMORIAL IF WE GOT TO 

469
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,710
THAT PLACE OR AN ON GOING DEAL. 

470
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,046
THERE'S A TWO YEAR LIMIT ON IT 

471
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:21,880
RIGHT NOW. 

472
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,581
THEY ACTUALLY WHEN WE PUT 

473
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,651
TOGETHER FOR THAT FAMILY AND 

474
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,751
FRIENDS GOT TO $150,000. 

475
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:29,388
WE STILL HAVE THAT SITTING IN A 

476
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,090
SIDE ACCOUNT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW 

477
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:38,730
THAT WAS SET-UP WAS TO ROLL 

478
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,230
INTO A GENERAL ACCOUNT. 

479
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,864
THIS WILL ROLL BACK INTO THE 

480
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:40,465
FAMILY AND CRIMESTOPPERS AND 

481
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:41,233
THEY'LL MAKE A DECISION TO DO 

482
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:41,399
IT. 

483
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,703
>> MY QUESTION IS FOR DALTON. 

484
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,437
THIS WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND OF THE 

485
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:53,612
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO 

486
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:54,646
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE-- 

487
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,580
>> YOU KNOW, IF THEY'RE 

488
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,616
LISTENING THEN I WOULD JUST 

489
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,384
LIKE THEM TO KNOW THAT IMAGINE 

490
00:16:59,384 --> 00:16:59,985
THIS WAS YOU. 

491
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,920
EVERYBODY HAS A MOLLIE IN THEIR 

492
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,687
LIFE, A PERSON THAT AFFECTED 

493
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:05,156
THEM IN A WAY THAT SHE AFFECTED 

494
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:06,325
EVERYBODY STANDING UP HERE 

495
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,594
RIGHT NOW AND IMAGINE IF THIS 

496
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,997
WAS YOU, SOMEBODY HAD TAKEN 

497
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:12,564
YOUR MOLLIE. 

498
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,999
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO HELP? 

499
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:14,967
WOULDN'T YOU WANT HER BACK? 

500
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:19,738
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL JUST DO THE 

501
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:28,446
RIGHT THING AND LET HER GO 

502
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:28,780
PRETTY MUCH. 

503
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,381
>> DID YOU SAY WHETHER OR NOT 

504
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,349
YOU THINK MOLLIE WAS ABDUCTED 

505
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:30,882
AT THIS POINT? 

506
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:33,519
>> I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE ON 

507
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,586
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HAVE 

508
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,721
HAPPENED BUT I DO THINK SHE'S 

509
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:42,694
OUT THERE AND I THINK WE CAN 

510
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,328
BRING HER HOME. 

511
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,596
AND IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS 

512
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,899
A COMMUNITY TO DO THAT, TO DO 

513
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,134
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN DO AND 

514
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,168
EVERYONE IN THE MEDIA IS DOING 

515
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:51,870
WHAT THEY CAN DO, REALLY 

516
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,203
FANTASTIC. 

517
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:53,238
FEELS GREAT TO OUR FAMILY. 

518
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,207
EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY IS 

519
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:55,474
DOING IT. 

520
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:59,545
AND SO I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE 

521
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,645
COUNTRY HAS ADOPTED MOLLIE. 

522
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:04,550
SO LET'S KEEP AT IT. 

523
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,318
LET'S GO GET HER. 

524
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,487
>> ONE THING TO ADD IS 

525
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:17,829
ADVERTISE SOME OF THE CRIME 

526
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:20,566
STOPPER INFORMATION ABOUT 200 

527
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,401

MUCH IMMEDIATELY TO 

529
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:24,570
AUTHORITIES. 

530
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,605
ANY TIME WE GET A TIP FROM 

531
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,239
CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA, MISSOURI 

532
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:31,476
WHEN THAT TIP COMES IN IT IS 

533
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:34,346
ROUTED TO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT 

534
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,013

00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:35,413
MUCH IMMEDIATELY. 

536
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:38,483
I DO HAVE THE STATEMENT THAT

LAURA HAD SHADE YOU WANTED A

HARD COPY OF IT TOO AND THEY'LL

BE UP HERE FOR YOU. 

540
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:03,308
>> ONE LAST AND-- 

541
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:03,942
>> WELL IT'S KIND OF A PARALLEL 

542
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:04,175
EFFORT. 

543
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:08,347
THIS WAS A FUND RAISING EFFORT. 

544
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,982
IF WE THROUGH RAISING FUNDS CAN 

545
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,750
GET OTHER INDIVIDUALS TO 

546
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,319

WITH THEM AND HAVING A STRATEGY 

551
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,327
THE FAMILY AND CRIMESTOPPERS WE 

552
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:26,498
