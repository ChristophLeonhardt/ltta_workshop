INVESTIGATE FORD'S ALLEGATIONS

73
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,692

TONIGHT THEY SHOULD TAKE ADVICE.

I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS,

81
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:52,840
SO WHAT HE SAID BACK IN 1991.

WORTH ANYTHING OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T

85
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:04,318
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

86
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,219

HE ACTUALLY THINKS THAT JUDGE

KAVANAUGH HAS TO PROVE HIS

98
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,650

VICTORY AT ALL COSTS, EVEN IF

113
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,352
THAT MEANS THROWING INALIENABLE

114

RIGHTS RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW.

115
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:20,861
SMEARING, SLANDER, DISBURSEMENT.

CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS, AND WE ARE

118
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:33,874
OKAY WITH NOT KNOWING WE MIGHT

119
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:38,979
PUT SOMEONE THAT IS -- LIKE THAT

00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:48,589
TESTIFY IN THE UNITED STATES

124
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:52,660

SHE HAS COME FORWARD

COURAGEOUSLY AND BRAVELY.

140
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,159
THINK SHE SHOULD BE BULLIED INTO

141
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,928
THE SCENARIO WHERE IT'S HE SAID,

142
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,864
SHE SAID IT, IT'S A SHAM

144
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:30,898
I DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD

147
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,038
THINK SHE'S CREDIBLE AND I THINK

WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS

149
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:42,076
FINISHED, AND WHEN SHE

00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:42,743
TESTIFIES, AND WHEN JUDGE

151
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,046
KAVANAUGH TESTIFIES, I THINK A

152
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:49,450
MAJORITY OF SENATORS WILL FIND

153
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:51,752

>> Tucker:          >> Sean: ME?

160
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,655
I BELIEVE THAT MEANS NO DUE

161
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,290
PROCESS OR PRESUMPTION OF

162
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:56,657
INNOCENCE.

163
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:57,758
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS ALSO FACING

164
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,761
AN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATION, A

165
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:01,662
TOTALLY UNCORROBORATED CLAIM

166
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,531
FROM A WOMAN NAMED DEBORAH

167
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:03,864
RAMIREZ.

168
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,967
SHE TOLD THE NEW YORK CURE IN

169
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:10,838
THE 1980s, 34 YEARS AGO

170
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,507
KAVANAUGH EXPOSED HIMSELF AT A

171
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:13,107
DRUNKEN COLLEGE PARTY.

172
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:16,678
AND GET THIS, RAMIREZ HERSELF

173
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:20,181
ISN'T EVEN TOTALLY SURE THAT

174
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,250
KAVANAUGH WAS A PERPETRATOR.

175
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,686
SHE SAID SHE BECAME "QUICKLY

176
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:25,853
INEBRIATED" AT THE PARTY.

177
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,889
SHE TOLD THE NEW YORKER, SHE WAS

178
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,691
A "FOGGY AND SLURRING HER

179
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:30,458
WORDS."

180
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,093
SHE EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES SHE HAS

181
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:34,028
SIGNIFICANT MEMORY GAPS FROM

182
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:37,365
THAT EVENING.

183
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:43,905
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" -- EVEN

184
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:46,074
ASKING IF SHE REMEMBERED THE

185

INCIDENT.

186
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:57,685
AND, WITH CONFIDENCE, IF THE

187
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:58,453
INCIDENT EVER OCCURRED WE WOULD

188
00:06:58,453 --> 00:07:01,222
HAVE SEEN OR HEARD ABOUT IT, AND

189
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:01,689
WE HAVE NOT.

190
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,758
THE BEHAVIOR SHE DESCRIBES WOULD

191
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:04,726
BE COMPLETELY OUT OF CHARACTER

192
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:14,535
FOR BRETT.

193
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,870
SHE ALSO THE NEW YORKER

194
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,871
INTERVIEWED RAMIREZ'S BEST

195
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,139
FRIEND AT THE TIME OF THE

196
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,441
INCIDENT, AND SHE ALSO IS

197
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:26,114
DENYING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE

198
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:26,447
CLAIMS.

199
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,583
I WAS NEVER TOLD THIS STORY BY

200
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,785
HER OR ANYONE ELSE.

201
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:35,056
IT NEVER CAME UP, I DIDN'T SEE

202
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:35,757
IT, AND "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

203
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:37,926
COULDN'T CORROBORATE THE STORY

204
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:39,260
IN ANY WAY.

205
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,128
THEY REFUSED TO PUBLISHED THE

206
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:42,931
CLAIMS AS PART OF HER REPORTING

207
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:49,637
AND SAID SHE SPENT WEEKS FINDING

208
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:50,505
ONE PERSON TO CORROBORATE IT.

209
00:07:50,505 --> 00:07:53,274
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY WILL NOT BE

210
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,676
CALLING MR. RAMIREZ TO TESTIFY.

211
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:56,644
STILL DESPITE THE LACK OF

212
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,213
EVIDENCE, THE LEFT OF COURSE

213
00:07:58,213 --> 00:07:59,948
RUSHING TO JUDGMENT AS THEY HAVE

214
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:04,819
IN SO MANY PRIOR OCCASIONS,

215
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:05,520
SMEARING JUDGE KAVANAUGH, NOT

216
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,722
EVEN WANTING TO HEAR HIS SIDE OF

217
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:08,857
IT.

218
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:10,458
AND RUSHING TO JUDGMENT AND

219
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,894
SAYING, I BELIEVE ONE PERSON.

220
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:15,063
THIS IS DANGEROUS FOR ANYONE IN

221
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:19,034
SOCIETY, WE SHOULD ALL BELIEVE

222
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:22,037
IT WOULD BE POLITICAL.

223
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:23,939
WE SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE

224
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,540
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE BUT

225
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,241
MANY DON'T.

226
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:26,741
WATCH THIS.

227
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:29,711
>> THIS IS A MONUMENTAL DEFINING

228
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:32,047
MOMENT THIS WEEK WHEN YOU HAVE

229
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:35,884
SOMEONE LIKE HIM GOING TO PRISON

230
00:08:35,884 --> 00:08:37,385
AND IN THE SAME BREATH,

231
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,186
KAVANAUGH POSSIBLY GOING TO THE

232
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:41,256
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND.

233
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:42,924
>> WE WANT AMERICA TO BELIEVE

234
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:44,426
THAT THE ONLY THING HE DID UNTIL

235
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:45,527
WELL INTO HIS COLLEGE YEARS WAS

236
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:48,864
EFFECTIVELY KISS OR WRENCH KISS

237
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:49,231
A WOMAN.

238
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:52,167
IS THAT WHAT HE WANTS AMERICA TO

239
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:52,500
BELIEVE?

240
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,936
>> AND TO BE HONEST THAT'S VERY

241
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:57,906
MUCH A WHITE MALE REPUBLICAN

242
00:08:57,906 --> 00:08:58,240
DEFENSE.

243
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,608
>> IF THEY GO THROUGH A SENATE

244
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:02,144
HEARING, AND IT BECOMES A SEAT,

245
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:03,579
CIRCUS, THEY PUSH IT THROUGH AND

246
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:07,082
IT PASSES, THERE WILL BE AS WE

247
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:09,151
SAID LAST WEEK AN ASTERISK THAT

248
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:11,687
IS THERE AS LONG AS HE'S THERE.

249
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:13,155
>> SO IF NANCY PELOSI,

OF, WHAT IS THE DEMOCRATIC

286
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:06,903
PLAYBOOK?

287
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:07,904
WE SEEN THESE CONFRONTATIONS

288
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:10,673

00:13:57,274 --> 00:14:03,046
SO WHILE ALL OF THIS IS GOING O

372
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:09,886
ON, THE PRESIDENT, WHO IS IN

373
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:10,487
NEW YORK AT THE TIME AND

374
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:11,188
LITERALLY PUSHING HIS AMERICA

375
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:11,922
FIRST AGENDA MOVING FORWARD WITH

376
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:12,623
HISTORIC SUCCESS, AND TODAY AT

377
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:13,323
THE U.N., HE STOOD UP SOLIDLY

378
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:13,857
FOR AMERICA FIRST.

379
00:14:13,857 --> 00:14:15,292
IN FRONT OF THE WORLD STAGE.

380
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,194
I THINK ONE OF HIS BEST SPEECHES

381
00:14:17,194 --> 00:14:29,306
TO DATE, TAKE A LISTEN.

382
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:30,007
IT'S ALMOST ANY ADMINISTRATION

383
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:35,746
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

384
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:38,983
AMERICA IS SO TRUE.

385
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:40,117
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT REACTION

386
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:49,260
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

387
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,494
AMERICA'S ECONOMY IS BOOMING

388
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:56,767
LIKE NEVER BEFORE.

389
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,469
THE STOCK MARKET IS AT AN

390
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:02,139
ALL-TIME HIGH IN HISTORY AND

391
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:05,042
JOBLESS CLAIMS ARE AT A 50 YEAR

392
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:05,442
LOW.

393
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:06,577
>> Sean: THAT'S A GREAT

394
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:07,478
SUCCESS FOR THE FORGOTTEN MEN

395
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:10,314
AND WOMEN THAT CAME OUT TO VOTE

396
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:10,648
IN 2016.

397
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:12,716
ARE YOU GOING TO GO OUT AND VOTE

398
00:15:12,716 --> 00:15:14,685

00:15:21,091 --> 00:15:28,265
AND, WE DO HAVE RECORD LOW

402
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:28,699
UNEMPLOYMENT.

403
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:30,101
HISPANIC AMERICANS,

00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,102
ASIAN-AMERICANS AND 65 YEAR LOW

FOR WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE IN

406
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:38,109
AMERICA.

407
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:39,877
FOR A MILLION FEWER PEOPLE ON

408
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:43,380
FOOD STAMPS, 4 MILLION MORE

409
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,915
AMERICANS WORKING, BREAKING

410
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:46,250
RECORDS IN THE STOCK MARKET,

411
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,618
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE HITTING AN

18 YEAR HIGH, AND IT NOW, A BLUE

413
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:51,222
WAVE.

414
00:15:51,222 --> 00:15:53,390
GUESS WHAT, TONIGHT IT MAY NOT

415
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,060
BE SO CERTAIN IS THAT MEDIA HAS

416
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,263
BEEN PEDDLING TO EVERYBODY.

417
00:15:59,263 --> 00:15:59,930
REPUBLICAN FAVORABILITY OUT

418
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,569
TODAY HAS NOW HIT A SEVEN YEAR

419
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:07,105
HIGH.

420
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:08,306
AMERICANS LITERALLY SPENT MORE

421
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:11,376
ON TAXES IN THE YEARS 2013

422
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:13,945
THROUGH 2016 THAN THEY DID ON

423
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:14,512
FOOD AND CLOTHING.

424
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:16,915
BY THE WAY, THE DEMOCRATS WANT

425
00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:17,415
THEIR CRIMES BACK.

426
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:20,285
IT'S NO SECRET OF THE

427
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:21,286
PRESIDENT'S SUCCESS.

428
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:22,854
HE DOESN'T GO ON APOLOGY TOUR

429
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:25,857
IS, HE PUTS AMERICA FIRST AND IT

430
00:16:25,857 --> 00:16:27,692
WORKS.

431
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:28,860
>> President Trump: AMERICA

432
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,328
WILL ALWAYS CHOOSE INDEPENDENCE

433
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:31,896
AND COOPERATION OVER GLOBAL

434
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:35,867
GOVERNMENTS, CONTROL AND

435
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:41,439
DOMINATION.

436
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:42,507
I ENCOURAGE EVERY DENOMINATION

437
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:44,676
IN THIS ROOM TO PURSUE ITS OWN

438
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:45,543
CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS.

439
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:46,311
THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT TELL

440
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:50,315
YOU HOW TO LIVE OR WORK OR

441
00:16:50,315 --> 00:16:51,816
WORSHIP.

442
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:54,119
WE ONLY ASK THAT YOU HONOR OUR

443
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:54,919
SOVEREIGNTY IN RETURN.

444
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:02,293
WE DO NOT ALLOW OUR CITIZENS TO

445
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:04,162
BE VICTIMIZED, OUR WORKERS TO BE

446
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:05,497
CHEATED AND OUR WEALTH TO BE

447
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:09,101
PLUNDERED OR TRANSFERRED.

448
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:09,867
AMERICA WILL NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR

449
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:13,204
PROTECTING ITS CITIZENS AND WE

450
00:17:13,204 --> 00:17:14,439
WILL NEVER SURRENDER AMERICA'S

451
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,974
SOVEREIGNTY TO AN UNELECTED,

452
00:17:16,974 --> 00:17:19,578
UNACCOUNTABLE, GLOBAL

453
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:21,546
BUREAUCRACY.

454
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:24,583
AMERICA IS GOVERNED BY AMERICAN

455
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,218
AMERICANS.

456
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:29,121
AND WE REJECT THE IDEOLOGY OF

457
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:33,492
GLOBALISM AND EMBRACE THE

458
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:34,493
DOCTRINE OF PATRIOTISM.

459
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:36,962
>> AND 42 DAYS YOU GET TO DECIDE

460
00:17:36,962 --> 00:17:38,063
IF THIS CONTINUES.

461
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:41,533
THE CLOIS TO MAKE A CHOICE IS

462
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,602
NOT CLEAR FOR THE AMERICAN

463
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:45,470
PEOPLE.

464
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,309
IT'S VERSUS THE PARTY FIRST.

465
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:51,977
THEY FORCE THE PRINCIPALS, LAW

466
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:56,315
AND ORDER.

467
00:17:56,315 --> 00:17:58,483
THAT IS VERSUS THE PARTY OF

468
00:17:58,483 --> 00:18:00,552
ECONOMIC GROWTH, LESS BURDENS OF

469
00:18:00,552 --> 00:18:03,822
REGULATIONS, LOWER TAXES, ENERGY

470
00:18:03,822 --> 00:00:00,000
AND, 42 DAYS, THEIR LIFE IS
