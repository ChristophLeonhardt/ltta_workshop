TAYLOR SWIFT HAS WON THE CASE
AGAINST HER AND HAS WON THE CASE
AGAINST THE DJ WHO SUED HER IN
THE FIRST PLACE.
WHAT IS THE FULL STORY?
THERE IS A DJ NAMED DAVID
MUELLER FROM COLORADO.
TAYLOR WAS DOING A MEET AND
GREET AND THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN.
NOW, ACCORDING TO TAYLOR AND NOW
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, IN THIS
PHOTO THE MAN, PICTURED ON
THE RIGHT, WAS REACHING
UNDERNEATH TAYLOR SKIRT AND
GRABBING HER BUNS.
THE PRESENT ON THE LEFT IS THAT
GUYS EX-GIRLFRIEND WHO UPON
LEARNING ALL THIS DUMPED HIM.
AS A RESULT, TAYLOR TOLD HER MOM
THAT THIS HAPPENED, WHO IS
HER MANAGER AND HER MAN TOLD
THE PERSON WHO DOES ALL THE
RADIO MEETING SET UP.
THEY TOLD THE GUYS EMPLOYER AND
THEY FIRED HIM.
AS A RESULT, THAT MAN SUE
TAYLOR.
IT BECAME A BIG STORY IN THE
MEDIA.
TAYLOR SUIT BACK FOR ONE DOLLAR,
SAYING THAT THIS GUY GROUPS
MY BUTT AND SHE JUST
WON THAT CASE.
THEY FOUND IN HER FAVOR AND NOW
HE HAS TO PAY HER ONE DOLLAR.
THIS WAS OF COURSE SYMBOLIC.
WHAT DID SHE SAY AFTERWARD?
SHE SAID I AM IN A POSITION
ESSENTIALLY RIGHT INTO THIS
LAWSUIT WHEN SOMEONE SEXUALLY
ASSAULT ME.
OTHER PEOPLE AREN'T AND IF YOU
DIDN'T LOVE TAYLOR SWIFT BUT FOR
NOW YOU HAVE TO.
IT IS THE LAW.
I AM NOT SURE THAT IS WHAT
THE RULING SAYS.
I WILL WRITE THAT DOWN.
MY FAVORITE PART OF THE STORY
WAS, REMEMBER, SHE DIDN'T SUE HIM
FIRST, HE STRUCK FIRST AND HE IS
LIKE OH MY GOD, SHE COST ME MY
JOB AND OF COURSE HE CLAIMS HE
DIDN'T GRAB HER ASS.
THE JUDGE DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM AND
IMMEDIATELY THREW OUT HIS LAWSUIT.
THERE LIKE LET'S GET STARTED,
YOUR LAWSUIT IS NONSENSE, GONE.
NOW LET'S HEAR TAYLOR SWIFT.
DON'T GET ME WRONG, I'M KIDDING
AROUND.
OF COURSE HE HEARD IT THROUGH AND
MADE THE DECISION.
HE THREW OUT THE PART
WHERE TAYLOR WAS POTENTIALLY TO
BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR FUTURE
LOST WAGES AGAINST HIM.
THE JUDGE TO SAID LISTEN, TAYLOR
JUST TOLD HER MOM YOU TOUCHED HER
BUTT AND AFTER THAT, IT WENT DOWN
TO YOUR EMPLOYER THAT YOU WOULD
DO THIS AND EMBARRASS YOUR RADIO
STATION IN THIS WAY AND SO THE
JUDGE THREW OUT THE CASE SAYING FOR
$300,000, THE REMAINDER OF THAT
GUYS CONTRACT WAS STILL UP FOR
ESSENTIALLY TO BE DECIDED AND
THEY DECIDED NO, NO ONE IS AS
POSSIBLE FOR THAT.
WHAT WAS HIS CONTRACT?
THE REMAINDER OF HIS CONTRACT
WAS UP TO $300,000.
IT WAS 150 A YEAR FOR TWO YEARS.
HE GOT FIRED EARLY FOR
MISCONDUCT.
USUALLY THEY HAVE A MORALS
CLAUSE IN THOSE KINDS OF
THINGS.
BUT WAIT, DID I MAKE TERRIBLE
MISTAKES IN MY LIFE?
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
HOW DOES SOME RANDO DJ IN COLORADO GET
AN INSANE CONTRACT FOR THE
REMAINDER OF HIS CONTRACT IS
$300,000?
THE REMAINDER OF HIS CONTRACT.
ANYWAY, SORRY.
THAT WAS SHOCKING INFORMATION.
BY THE WAY, JUST TO GIVE YOU
GUYS A LITTLE MORE,
$300,000, MORE DETAILS IN THE
STORY, THIS INFORMATION
TRAVEL TO HIS EMPLOYER AND HIS
EMPLOYER DIDN'T JUST DECIDE
TO FIRE HIM IMMEDIATELY.
THEY DID HIS FULL INVESTIGATION
AND THE DJ KEPT CHANGING A
STORIES AND FINALLY THERE WERE
LIKE WE'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT
BEING HONEST WITH US WE'RE GOING
TO LET YOU GO DIET I THINK
THE JUDGE RULED THE RIGHT WAY IN
THIS CASE AND TAYLOR SWIFT
AND GO OUT OF HER WAY
TO DESTROY HIS LIFE.
SHE DID GO TO THE AUTHORITIES
WHICH THERE IS A CASE TO BE MADE
THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE, JUST DON'T
GRAB PEOPLE'S ASSES IF YOU WANT
TO KEEP YOUR JOB.
RECOVERED IT WHEN THIS
LAWSUIT FIRST CAME ABOUT.
IF YOU HAVE ANY SYMPATHY FOR HIM
BECAUSE YOU LIKE HOW CAN THEY
TELL?
FIRST OF ALL THAT'S WHY THEY DID
TRIALS.
THEY DID A TRIAL DECIDED HE DID
DO IT AT THE JURY DECIDED THAT.
AND SECONDARILY, WHEN THEY ASKED
HIM CAN WE GET THAT RECORDING OF
YOU TALKING TO YOUR EMPLOYERS
ABOUT THE INCIDENT BECAUSE THAT
WILL BE GREAT EVIDENCE AND YOU
SAY YOU ARE RIGHT, SO THAT WOULD
BE GREAT AND HE IS LIKE I
SPILLED COFFEE ON MY LAPTOP AND
THEY ARE LIKE BUT THERE IS A
HARD DRIVE THIS SHOULD ALSO HAVE
IT.
OH MAN, I LOST THE HARD DRIVE.
BUT YOUR PHONE ALSO RECORDED
IT.
I THREW THAT ONE IN THE GARBAGE.
COME ON.
THERE WERE WITNESSES
WHO SAW HIM GRAB HER ASS.
THAT IS WHY THEY CAME TO THIS
CONCLUSION.
MY FAVORITE ARE HER RESPONSES
TO HIS LAWYER WHEN THEY WERE
DOING THIS LAWSUIT.
VULTURE DID AN EXPOS…, THE BEST
COMEBACKS FROM TAYLOR SWIFT.
HERE'S SOME EXCERPTS.
SHE IS 
THE BEST.
I LOVE HER, AND FINALLY:
SHEíS SO GOOD.
BY THE WAY, THE BODYGUARD DID
SEE FROM THE SIDE THAT HE
GRABBED HER ASS.
THE ONLY THING THE BODYGUARD
SAID WAS, I DON'T KNOW IF HE
TOUCHED BARE SKIN, WHICH TAYLOR
SAYS THAT HE DID.
THIS GUY WAS SO BRAZEN HE WENT
UNDER THE SKIRT AND INSIDE HER
UNDERWEAR.
WHILE HIS GIRLFRIEND IS ALSO
POSING IN THE PHOTO WITH HIM.
AND THEN HE HAD THE TEMERITY
TO SUE HER FOR THAT.
SO RIDICULOUS.
ALL RIGHT THAT HEAVILY
CENTERPIECE?
I'M GOING TO WRITE AN EMAIL
SAYING HOW GREAT SHE IS AND
SEND IT TO MYSELF SO
I CAN READ IT.
