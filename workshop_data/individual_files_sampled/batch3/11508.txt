absolutely shocking that's how a group of US Republican Congressmen have reacted after seeing a new top secret intelligence document they believe it details the abuse of surveillance powers under the Obama administration I had that same shock feeling I was like wait a minute this actually happened from our Justice Department and this FBI that's how serious this is there has been a real attempt to undermine this president as the type of information that we need all Americans to see immediately the American people deserve they must they want to know what's in this document sadly much of the mainstream media will not be covering this today but in this house on this day let us know that indeed we are still one nation under God and willing to protect life the content of this secret document is obviously unknown and it's still unclear whether or not it will even be released but judging from the comments made by the Republicans it is thought it could potentially outline serious political bias within the FBI and the Department of Justice during investigations in the so called the whole Trump Russia Kaluga claims now a Democrats also were quick to reaction on the memo denouncing well all of its contents they call the document a profoundly misleading set of talking points which attacks the FBI and gives a distorted view of the bureau a TV host and political commentator Steve mult spoke things the Democrats have a very good reason for wanting to hide the memo from the public I think it's going to put a bigger cloud than already exists there has been a lot of talk that some members of the Obama administration illegally and without any reason or rhyme went and got FISA warrants against the American civilians who were affiliated with Trump with absolutely no reason to have those obtained you think Obama didn't know about any of this this was his Justice Department his FBI they were trying to get Hillary elected I think this is going to go right to the top and by the way if this is such a bunch of nothing and it's bad talking points blah blah blah blah blah from Adam Schiff and the Democrats on the committee then why not vote to release it so you could clear all this up let everybody see it the Democrats want to hide this document and we better get to the bottom of it and we all need to see it
