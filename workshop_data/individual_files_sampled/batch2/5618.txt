with fewer than five months before the midterm election Speaker Paul Ryan has a tough job trying to hold on to the House of Representatives for Republicans while conservatives in the House are making that all the more difficult on Wednesday Ryan showed some distance from President Trump when he said he agrees with a representative trey Gowdy on Spygate here's what trey gowdy said and paul ryan's reaction i am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got do you agree would trey gowdy yet normally I don't like to comment on classified briefings let me say it this way I think chairman Gowdy's initial assessment is accurate I have seen no evidence to the contrary of the initial assessment that chairman Gowdy has made that night on Fox News one of Donald Trump's most loyal supporters issued this threat to Paul Ryan I run in the more conservative circles of the house and I have never uppon to this point heard a single person talk about removing Speaker Ryan from the speakership today for the first time I I was hearing colleagues say well you know if speaker Ryan won't stand with us in this fight over the essentials of our of our democracy do we need to look at other choices Wow yesterday morning Paul Ryan tacked back towards Trump let me see one more point in all of us in any of this there has been no evidence that there's any collusion between the Trump campaign and the President Trump in Russia let's just make that really clear there's no evidence of collusion this is about Russia and what they did and making sure they don't do it again hmm making matters more complicated for Republicans and the NBC news/wall Street Journal poll 48% of registered voters say they're more likely to support a candidate who promised who promises to be a check on Trump versus 23% who are less likely that is a 25 point difference Democrats are also favored to control Congress by 10 points 50% favored Democrats while 40% back Republicans now do you want to know what President Trump said about Paul Ryan today that's next this week Paul Ryan displayed a little bit of independence from President Trump when he said he agreed with trey Gowdy who said he's convinced that the FBI did what Americans would want them to do during its investigation of the Trump campaign now here is what Donald Trump had to say today about that what Paul Ryan saying it didn't come out that way the fact is they had people in our campaign they had people doing things that have never been done in the history of this country and it really is a disgrace back with us for Neera tanden and Jennifer Rubin Jennifer Paul Ryan didn't say what he meant to say that's not what he meant to say at all that's what the president says you know it's really remarkable no matter how many times this is disproven by how many people the president will repeat the same lie after lie after lie there is no evidence there was no spy planted on the campaign maybe she should go talk to trey Gowdy who apparently saw the documents and got the briefing I would also say his continual claim of no collusion no collusion is also false we know for example about george papadapolis reaching out to a russian source to get dirt on hillary we know about the Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016 in which their promised Iran Hillary and they meet if you think that collusion is seeking from a foreign power information something of value to help you win in an election yes we have evidence of that already the question is how extensive it was and who all was involved in it Jennifer just laid out all the points Neera why is Paul Ryan who somebody who is retiring in in January why would he stake his reputation going out and saying something like there's been no evidence whatsoever of any collusion nothing to see here what is going on with Paul Ryan well I think with the poll polling shows and the NBC Wall Street Journal poll shows is that Paul Ryan is between a rock and a hard place so obviously that that rock is Donald Trump and the stranglehold he has on Republican base voters he Paul Ryan and the rest of the Republican Party are desperate to ensure that they turnout for a public in Congress that is not that popular and and the hard places independent voters obviously Democrats but really the strong majority of independent voters who would like the who are basically tired of the insanity that we're dealing with every day from Donald Trump and want a check on it and wants a check on it by a very strong margin and I think that's really the basic problem for for Paul Ryan who has demonstrated no conviction obviously did basically a 180 within the course of a day because I'm sure someone at the White House explained that the president had some disfavor about what he said and so he came up with live this statement which is absolutely patently false we it's it is Jennifer's a hundred percent correct we know there's been collusion the question is whether it's criminal collusion but there has actually been determined facts that the Trump campaign itself was colluding with Russia to ensure Hillary lost and Donald Trump won and does that explain though the rock and the hard place is that explain and the desire to maintain control in Congress does that explain what Mitt Romney said about Donald Trump I believe this was today I think President Trump will be renown nated by my party easily and I think he'll be re-elected solidly I think that not just because of the strong economy and because people are increasingly seeing rising wages but I think it's also true because I think our Democrat friends are likely to nominate someone who is really out of the mainstream of American thought this is Mitt Romney who went to a stage during the campaign in 2016 in Utah and said Donald Trump was a con he was a fraud he was a fake he was very very not smart and who mocked him for all of his failed businesses what is going on with Mitt Romney Jennifer Rubin I think he had a spasm of conscience during the campaign and that quickly passed and he is now back to the finger in the wind routine this is of course what many of us who were formerly in the Republican Party predicted that Donald Trump has had an utterly corrosive corrupting influence on just about everyone in the Republican Party whether it's Paul Ryan whether it's Mitt Romney apparently the only Republicans who see fit to challenge him in any fashion are those who not only want to retire but they want to run for president in 2020 or if you're a governor of Ohio other than that the Republicans are essentially rolling over and playing dead time and time again and it's pathetic it really is the profiles encouraged are also the profiles in retreat near what do you make of this though if you look at a if you look at what voters want would you vote for a candidate who promises to be a check on Trump 48% says they say they are more likely to do that 23% say they are less likely these are just registered voters in general it's not it's not down to party well so I think this is what first I would say about Mitt Romney is that Mitt Romney is running for for Senate in Utah and he actually in the state party nominating process he had a real threat from a hardline conservative and I think he's trying to prove just like a lot of Republicans but particularly because he was critical of Donald Trump in the past he's trying to prove that his conservative bonafide he's we can't forget that a a House member this week was almost almost lost her seat because she was critical a Republican House member was critical of Donald Trump a year and a half ago and she's facing it she faced a threat and is forced into a runoff say Donald Trump is is obviously a deep threat to any Republican who is willing to step up and say he's done you know criticize him in any way they face deep political consequences but I think what your poll shows deep political consequences with Republicans but with the poll shows is that a strong majority of Americans need and just for sanity sake I'd say at this point need a check on the kind of constant barrage the culture of corruption the day in and day out news we have five instances of Pruitt's corruption a day these days you know people want some accountability and Republicans enforce that they can't do that and a president who says that he can pardon himself if he wants there's also that near attended Jennifer Rubin happy Friday thank you so
