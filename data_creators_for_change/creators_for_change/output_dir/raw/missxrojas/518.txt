we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make proper length it is</font>

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,309
about the names<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were mentioned in</font>

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:15,719
the video before so this video might be

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,880
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> random could I be saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,100
word way too much but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to</font>

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to some friends of mine</font>

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:33,989
first we have Eve<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuck you guys you</font>

12
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,290
voted<font color="#CCCCCC"> no it's just how casually open</font>

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,879
with a green light conveniently there

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,950
who's this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is josh hartnett it's</font>

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,110
Janice's josh hartnett hey as you can

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,809
see the eve character is incredibly shy

17
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,449
she has been likened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mischa barton of</font>

18
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,329
the AC and God her facebook page says

19
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,640
that she likes wagamama<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like wagamama</font>

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,710
this might be why we're friends but I

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,590
doubt it Eve also has a particularly

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,329
nice collection of shoes but because my

23
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,280
feet are the size of the clowns I can't

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,140
fit into them<font color="#E5E5E5"> Georgia actually has a</font>

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,640
her out<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoop invert all joking and</font>

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,470

ask her very inappropriate things but

46
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,710
she's also a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> creative than I am</font>

going through people's videos that you

85
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,780
