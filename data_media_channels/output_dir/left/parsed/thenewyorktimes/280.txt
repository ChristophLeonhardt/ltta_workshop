I consider myself an artist, and
I’m inspired by other artists.
By people who make stuff.
One of my greatest
inspirations is my grandfather
who was an artist throughout
his life and made stuff until,
like, literally the last week
he spent on planet Earth.
You know, at 94 years old,
he was still painting.
Gramps left over 100
sketchbooks and 2,500 paintings.
And in talking with my dad who’s
been trying to sift through it all
I didn’t realize just how much
stuff I hadn’t seen before.
“Do you have the — 
his story of his life?
Have you seen that?”
No.
No.
“It’s Gramps’s memory book.
Did I give that to you?”
So apparently, Gramps kept
a log of random memories
in a sketchbook.
Hundreds of pages of
writing and illustrations.
He’ll have a memory
about a geography test
he took in seventh
grade, butted up
against a memory of
surviving a plane crash,
which 15 pages
later he’ll revisit
to describe in more detail.
He talks about seeing
the original “Frankenstein”
with his father in 1931 and his
experiences in World War II,
but throughout there are
accounts of the stuff
he was making.
This is a really small drawing,
but it grabbed my attention.
Apparently, he bought
this Chevy for 50 bucks
and it didn’t come with windows.
And so instead, as a joke,
he fashioned his own.
“It was the time of
the Chicago gangsters
and in the empty
window slots,
I made cardboard 
cut-outs of mobsters.”
Wait, empty window slots?
So it was just open?
“Yeah.”
No glass?
“Yeah, but you could roll,
but nothing would roll up.
So he made these things
that would be underneath,
but you’d roll them up,
and that’s what you’d see.”
 No way!
My grandfather was a man who
got a crazy idea in his head
and just ran with it.
And this is something
I want to be more like.
When I was going
through the memory book,
I came across a couple
of memories of Gramps
creating something that
actually involved my dad,
and I wanted to see
whether or not he
remembered these same events.
“He always talked about when
he was little at the dentist,
he was looking at
a magazine that
had a bicycle with wings on it.
And I think the
front of the bicycle,
the wheel was up in the air.
I don’t know what, but it
sparked his imagination
and he had mentioned
a few times.
Anyway, he built
these things and they
were cardboard two or three
ply that he had taped together,
and then he put some
little propellers
from his model airplanes.
We went to Audubon
Park to ride it.
But I guess, you know, I
knew I wasn’t going to fly,
but I sort of had the impression
that the front wheel
would come up.
You know, I just
thought it would
be an experience other than just
riding around with these wings on.
And of course, nothing happened
and I was really disappointed.”
There were so many
pages of memories.
So many stories I hadn’t heard.
And I find myself
reflecting on this moment
on the phone talking to my
dad about his dad,
connected by something that was
made specifically for us.
“Yeah. Well, the thing that was really
neat in his last few years,
he would just pull
these off the shelf
and, like,
live his life again.
And then he’d stop
when he saw an image,
and he would paint it.
You know?”
“Look on page 42 …”
Wow, yeah … I see it.
How old is he at that point?
“… look at this one. 
This is good. Page 38 …”
So incredible.
“36. Page 36 …
Oh, that’s 1914 … ”
The stuff my
grandfather made seemed
to help him interpret
and chronicle
the journey of his life.
I’d like to make
stuff like that too,
and this seems like a
decent place to start.
Thanks, Dad.
“O.K.”
Have a good weekend.
“O.K. Same to you.”
All right. See you.
“Bye bye.”
