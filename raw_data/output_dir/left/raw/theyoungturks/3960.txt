1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,569
DEMOCRAT TIM RYAN OF OHIO HAS
BROKEN WITH HIS PARTY AND IS

2
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:08,420
PUSHING FOR SOME TAX POLICY
IDEAS THAT DON'T SEEM TOO FAR

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,070
OFF OF SOME OF THE RHETORIC
COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,639
THESE DAYS.

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,469
HERE'S HIM
EXPLAINING.

6
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:17,490
TO BE COMPETITIVE GLOBALLY WE
HAVE TO REDUCE THE CORPORATE TAX

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,490
RATE.

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,520
WE ARE JUST NOT
COMPETITIVE GLOBALLY BECAUSE OF

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,520
THAT.

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,359
THE GOAL FOR US, AND I KNOW THE
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, PEOPLE

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,480
ARE AGAINST IT, IS TO CREATE THE
NEW MODEL.

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,111
WE CAN'T JUST BE A PARTY OF
REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH, WE

13
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:37,340
NEED TO BE THE PARTY OF THE
CREATION OF WEALTH IN

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,860
COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY.

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,070
NOT JUST SILICON VALLEY

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,830
OR WALL STREET, ALL OVER.

17
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,300
I'VE BEEN TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND
IOWA BUT IF ALSO BEEN TO SOUTH

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,600
CAROLINA AND BIRMINGHAM,
ALABAMA, I WILL BE UP IN

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,730
INDIANA, I WILL BE IN KENTUCKY
-- TO GO TO THESE PLACES AND SEE

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,320
THE KIND OF GROWTH MESSAGE,
OPPORTUNITY MESSAGE, NOT

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,980
COMPLETELY ANTIBUSINESS MESSAGE,
NOT BEING HOSTILE TO BUSINESS,

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,000
PLAY IN DEMOCRATIC CROWDS IN
COMMUNITIES THAT KNOW THEY NEED

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,830
INVESTMENT AND KNOW THEY NEED
GROWTH, KNOW THEY NEED SOMEBODY

24
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,500
TO HIRE THE WORKERS WE KEEP
TALKING ABOUT, IF WE COULD

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,580
FIGURE OUT THE ECONOMIC QUESTION
WHICH IS HOW DO WE GET MONEY OUT

26
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,170
OF THE COASTS AND INTO THE
INDUSTRIAL MIDWEST AND CREATE

27
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:27,450
JOBS IN PLACES LIKE THE ONES I
REPRESENT, THAT'S A GAME

28
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,850
CHANGER FOR ME.

29
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,770
TWO THINGS RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
FIRST THAT HE EVEN USED THE TERM

30
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,090
REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH -- STOP
FRAMING THINGS THE WAY

31
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,000
CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS
WANT YOU TO, THAT'S INSANE.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
COME

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
UP WITH SOME OTHER TERM.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,050
EVEN IF
I DISAGREE WITH YOUR POLICIES

35
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,570
YOU CAN TRY TO COME UP WITH A
WAY TO EXPRESS IT THAT DOESN'T

36
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,180
IMMEDIATELY CONFIRM EVERYTHING
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN SAYING.

37
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,550
AND SECOND, WITH THIS AS HIS
ECONOMIC CORE MESSAGE, HE'S

38
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,860
GOING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA?

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,980
YOU COULD PROBABLY SAVE YOURSELF

40
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,799
THOSE STOPS BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY
DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING FROM THE

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,240
LAST ELECTION.

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,870
IF HE'S TAKING
ABOUT 2020 AND THIS IS THE CORE

43
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,870
MESSAGE?

44
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,870
GOOD LUCK.

45
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,410
THAT SEEMS QUESTIONABLE.

46
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,730
THAT WAS PATHETIC.

47
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,950
I DON'T
CARE IF HE'S A FRIEND OF THE

48
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,060
SHOW, I DON'T CARE IF HE'S BEEN
A GUEST A BILLION TIMES, THAT

49
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,560
WAS A RIDICULOUS ARGUMENT.

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,840
HE SAID TAKE THE WEALTH OUT
OF THE COASTS.

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,310
NOT MAKE SURE BOTH ARE DOING
WELL, TAKE IT OUT OF THE COASTS.

52
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,950
THAT IS REPUBLICAN FRAMING, I
DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S COMING

53
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,500
FROM OR TRYING TO GO --

54
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
WE KNOW.

55
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,540
HE'S TRYING TO APPEASE
CORPORATE DONORS, BUT IF YOU ARE

56
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,530
GENUINELY CONCERNED ABOUT MIDDLE
AMERICA AND MAKING SURE THEY

57
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,480
HAVE JOBS AND DECENT WAGES, WHY
DON'T YOU DO SOME THING ABOUT

58
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,000
AUTOMATION, OR THE FACT THAT THE
PRESIDENT JUST APPLIED FOR MORE

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,120
FOREIGN WORKERS TO COME INTO THE
COUNTRY AND TAKE LOW-LEVEL JOBS

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,780
AWAY FROM AMERICANS?

61
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,560
DO
SOMETHING TO PROTECT ACCESSIBLE

62
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
EDUCATION.

63
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,270
DO A BILLION THINGS
THAT COULD HELP PEOPLE IN

64
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,989
AMERICA ACTUALLY SUCCEED.

65
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,640
WHY
DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING TO

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,230
PENALIZE THE COMPANIES THAT
OUTSOURCE THESE JOBS?

67
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,230
REALLY,

68
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,160
YOU ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
CUTTING TAXES BECAUSE THAT'S

69
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,420
WORKED OUT SO WELL SO FAR?

70
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,380
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE
LIKELY PUSH TO SLASH TAXES, HOW

71
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,489
SOME DEMOCRATS WILL ALMOST
CERTAINLY SIGN ON TO IT, THAT'S

72
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,459
BAD BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE
CHANCES IT WILL GET PASSED, AND

73
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,569
THEY CAN ALSO SAY IT'S
BIPARTISAN TAX REFORM, IS IT

74
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,910
POSSIBLE HE WILL BE ONE OF
THOSE?

75
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,879
YOU DON'T ENTER INTO THE

76
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,040
NEGOTIATIONS ALREADY HAVING
SURRENDERED SO MUCH.

77
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
ON THE

78
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,410
OTHER HAND, NANCY PELOSI
ADDRESSED TRUMP'S PROPOSED TAX

79
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:57,510
PLAN BY SAYING THIS --

80
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,569
YOU HAVE TO SAY MORE, BUT
THAT IS THE FIRST BLOW AGAINST

81
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:03,000
THE TAX PLAN, THAT IT IS FIRST
AND FOREMOST AND ONLY FOR

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
BILLIONAIRES.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,990
NOT THAT IT'S THE PATH TO
COMPETITIVENESS GLOBALLY

84
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,010
FOR AMERICAN CORPORATIONS.

85
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,380
I HAVE TO JUMP IN ONE MORE
TIME AND GET IT OUT OF MY

86
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,668
SYSTEM, THEN YOU CAN RAGE -- HOW
MANY CORPORATIONS, HOW MANY

87
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:20,458
BANKS, PAY NOTHING IN FEDERAL
TAXES?

88
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,459
NOTHING?

89
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,060
IN FACT, THEY

90
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,259
GET A TAX REBATE.

91
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,259
HOW MANY OF
YOU MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS,

92
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:29,919
WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS, HAVE TO
PAY FEDERAL TAXES?

93
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,029
AND IF YOU

94
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:34,379
DON'T YOU WILL HAVE THE IRS
BREATHING DOWN YOUR NECK, NICKEL

95
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,479
AND DIMING YOU.

96
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,020
BUT ALL THESE
GIANT TELECOMMUNICATIONS

97
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:50,180
COMPANIES AND BANKS THAT PROFIT
-- THE EFFECTIVE CORPORATE TAX

98
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,050
RATE, THEY PAY LESS TAXES THAN
WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS AND THIS

99
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,080
ASSHOLE HAS THE AUDACITY TO
STAND THERE AND SAY THEY WILL

100
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,189
CREATE JOBS.

101
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:04,009
WHAT THEY DO IS
CONTINUALLY CUT JOBS, OUTSOURCE

102
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:07,050
THEM, AUTOMATE THEM, AND
BASICALLY SCREW US OVER.

103
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,180
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

104
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,139
JOHN AND ANA MENTIONED ABOUT
FRIEND OF THE SHOW, AND ALL

105
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,139
THIS.

106
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,139
WAS, I GUESS.

107
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:21,869
A LONG TIME
AGO, IN A PLACE FAR FAR AWAY, ON

108
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:25,819
WILSHIRE, WHEN WE DID THIS SHOW
AND HAVE A LOT MORE GUESTS, IT

109
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:29,839
WAS A THREE-HOUR SHOW, RADIO AND
ONLINE, TIM RYAN WAS PROBABLY

110
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,819
THE CONGRESSMAN WHO MOST CAME ON
THE YOUNG TURKS.

111
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:33,819
WE APPRECIATED

112
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:38,969
THAT, I LIKED HIM PERSONALLY, I
WENT OUT A COUPLE TIMES IN DC

113
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:44,320
WITH THEM, ETC., BUT THIS TO ME
IS NOT PERSONAL, THIS STATEMENT

114
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,550
OF HIS, AND THIS IDEA, IS 100%
WRONG.

115
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,089
AND THIS HAPPENS TO

116
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,089
PEOPLE, MAN.

117
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:53,599
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HIS INTENTIONS WERE WHEN HE

118
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:58,770
FIRST CAME IN, HE WAS VERY YOUNG
WHEN HE DID, HE WENT AGAINST AN

119
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,379
INCUMBENT, BEAT HIM, ETC., BUT I
DO KNOW THAT WASHINGTON SEEPS

120
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:08,039
IN, AND I'M SO GLAD WE DIDN'T
BASE THIS SHOW IN WASHINGTON,

121
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:14,529
DC, BECAUSE IT'S TOXIC AND GETS
INTO YOUR SYSTEM.

122
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:15,529
YOU CAN PUT

123
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,960
ASIDE HIS INTENTIONS OR WHAT
HAPPENS TO HIM, JUST JUDGE HIM

124
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
ON THE POLICY.

125
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,439
AND THE POLICY IS
DISASTROUS.

126
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,500
AND THE FRAMING IS

127
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,879
DISASTROUS, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT.

128
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,879
WHEN YOU HAVE A DEMOCRAT

129
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,110
SAYING WE SHOULD STOP
REDISTRIBUTING WEALTH, YOU JUST

130
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,330
HANDED REPUBLICANS A GIANT GIFT.

131
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,409
YOU TOLD THEM DEMOCRATS ARE THE
BAD GUYS WHO REDISTRIBUTE

132
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:36,409
WEALTH.

133
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:42,729
CAN WE START IT BEFORE WE STOP
IT?

134
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:46,559
IF YOU WANT TO DO THE RIGHT
FRAMING, AND IT'S NOT JUST

135
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:50,469
FRAMING, IT'S REALITY, THERE IS
A PARTY HERE IN AMERICA THAT HAS

136
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:58,849
REDISTRIBUTED WEALTH, IT'S THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

137
00:06:58,849 --> 00:06:59,849
CORPORATIONS

138
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:03,219
USE TO PAY ABOUT 35% OF THE
TAXES IN AMERICA, NOW THEY PAY

139
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:04,969
11% OF THE TAXES IN AMERICA.

140
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:08,309
FROM 1952 TO 2015, THAT'S THE

141
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:09,779
DIFFERENCE.

142
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,279
WHERE DID THEY
REDISTRIBUTE THOSE TAXES TO?

143
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,279
TO

144
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,929
THE PAYROLL TAX, WHICH IS PAID
BY MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS, THAT

145
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:18,710
WENT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
FROM AROUND 10% TO AROUND ONE

146
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,369
THIRD OF ALL OUR TAXES.

147
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:23,710
CORPORATIONS REDISTRIBUTED THE

148
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,149
WEALTH SO THEY GOT TO PUT IT IN
THEIR POCKET AND THEY MADE YOU

149
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:30,990
PAY FOR IT. AND INSTEAD OF
MAKING THAT CLAIM, WHICH IS

150
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,960
BASED IN FACT, HE HELPS THE
REPUBLICAN TALKING POINTS BY

151
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,050
PRETENDING THE DEMOCRATS ARE
DOING REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH.

152
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,259
I CAN SHOW YOU EXACTLY HOW TAXES
HAVE GONE DOWN PRECIPITOUSLY,

153
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:46,860
THE EFFECTIVE CORPORATE TAX
RATE, AND TAXES FOR THE RICHEST

154
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,530
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY.

155
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,159
IN WHAT
REPUBLICANS CALL THE GOLDEN ERA,

156
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,679
OF THE 1950S AND 60S, THE
HIGHEST MARGINAL TAX RATE WAS

157
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,679
91%.

158
00:07:56,679 --> 00:08:00,729
THAT'S NOT 91% OF ALL YOUR
MONEY, IT WAS AFTER A CERTAIN

159
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:04,209
AMOUNT, IN TODAY'S DOLLARS AND
MIGHT BE AFTER 10 MILLION THEY

160
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:07,249
START TAXING YOU AT THAT RATE.

161
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:10,779
WE HAD A BOOMING ECONOMY, WAGES

162
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:15,139
WERE GOING UP ALONG WITH
PRODUCTIVITY.

163
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:16,139
INSTEAD NOW WE

164
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,439
HAVE IS A UNILATERAL SURRENDER.

165
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,560
AND IT'S NOT SURRENDERING TO THE

166
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,089
REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT'S
SURRENDERING TO THE DONORS

167
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:27,740
BECAUSE THE DONORS PAY FOR
REALLY STRONG REPUBLICANS WHO

168
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,270
PUSH THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM TO
THE RIGHT, AND REALLY WEAK,

169
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:37,179
COMPLIANT DEMOCRATS WHO GO THE
REPUBLICANS ARE SO RIGHT.

170
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,179
THOSE

171
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:41,829
DEMOCRATS, THEY JUST KEEP TAKING
FROM THE POOR RICH, THOSE POOR

172
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,870
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS WHO
JUST CAN'T SEEM TO CATCH A

173
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,870
BREAK.

174
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,160
AND WHAT ON GOD'S GREEN
EARTH ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

175
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,900
TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE COASTS
AND PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE OF

176
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,900
THE COUNTRY?

177
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,040
IF YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT JOB CREATION, THAT'S

178
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,740
GREAT, WE ARE ALL IN FAVOR OF
THAT.

179
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,440
HERE, BE IN FAVOR OF MAYBE

180
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,030
A $2 TRILLION INFRASTRUCTURE
PACKAGE, WHY DON'T YOU INTRODUCE

181
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,130
THAT PACKAGE?

182
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:10,040
WHICH CREATES
ROADS, BRIDGES, CLEAN WATER

183
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,970
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND WOULD
CREATE JOBS ALL ACROSS THE

184
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,890
COUNTRY, WITHOUT PUNISHING THE
COASTS.

185
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,490
YOU SOUND LIKE A

186
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,560
WEAKSAUCE REPUBLICAN, WHICH IS
EXACTLY WHAT THE DONORS LOVE.

187
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,600
AND LAST THING, THIS GUY
CHALLENGED NANCY PELOSI, AND I

188
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,120
HAVE NO LOVE FOR NANCY PELOSI, I
THINK SHE IS WAY PAST HER TIME,

189
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,780
BUT ON THIS ISSUE SHE IS EXACTLY
RIGHT, SHE HAS THE RIGHT

190
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,480
FRAMING, AND YOU THOUGHT IT'S A
YOUNG UPSTART CHALLENGING NANCY

191
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,540
PELOSI, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT RYAN
WAS GOING IN THIS DIRECTION,

192
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,430
MAYBE THAT'S A GREAT THING --
NO, FORGET IT.

193
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,430
YOU'RE TELLING ME

194
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:53,750
YOUR GENIUS IDEA IS TO CHALLENGE
THAT THE PELOSI FROM THE RIGHT?

195
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,930
LOOK AT WHAT CONGRESSMAN RYAN
SAID THERE -- I'VE BEEN TO IOWA

196
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,500
AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT I ALSO
WENT TO SOUTH CAROLINA.

197
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
THAT'S

198
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
THE THIRD VOTING STATE IN THE
PRIMARIES.

199
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,960
THAT'S NOT AN ALSO,

200
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,110
THAT'S NOT A BUT, THAT'S AN AND.

201
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,860
YOU WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT AS A

202
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,220
FRESH FACE AND YOUR FRESH IDEA
IS TO DO THE SAME THING

203
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,740
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN DOING FOR 40
YEARS, BOWING TO REPUBLICANS AND

204
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,310
CORPORATE DONORS?

205
00:10:23,310 --> 00:00:00,000
SAD, SAD END
TO A ONCE PROMISING CAREER.
