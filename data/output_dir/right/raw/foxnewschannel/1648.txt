1
00:00:01,193 --> 00:00:02,428
A CAMPAIGN.

2
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:04,296
THE CHIEF OF THAT IS RUNNING FOR

3
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,297
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

4
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,065
STATES.

5
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:07,232
MOLLIE, THANKS VERY MUCH.

6
00:00:07,232 --> 00:00:08,333
>> THANK YOU.

7
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:11,437
>> Neil: AND HE'S IS PRESIDENT

8
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:12,638
NOW AND NOW HE'S TALKING TRADE

9
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:13,639
WERE THE CHINESE.

10
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,107
THE PRESIDENT WILL MEET WITH THE

11
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:16,308
HEAD DELEGATION FROM CHINA.

12
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,976
AHEAD OF THAT, HE HAD A LOT TO

13
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:18,610
SAY ON IT.

14
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,180
TAKE A LOOK.

15
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,716
>> HAVE YOU EVER EVEN SEEN A

16
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:24,717
NEGOTIATING IN TRADE?

17
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:26,618
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN OUR COUNTRY

18
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:27,352
NEGOTIATE ON TRADE.

19
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:29,555
TRADE WITH CHINA AND WITH OTHER

20
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:30,022
COUNTRIES.

21
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:31,256
I'M NOT JUST BLAMING CHINA.

22
00:00:31,256 --> 00:00:32,458
CHINA IS THE BIGGEST.

23
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:36,028
BUT TRADE IS A TOTAL ONE-WAY

24
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:36,462
STREET.

25
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:37,429
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

26
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:38,697
OHIO REPUBLICAN SENATOR ROB

27
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:39,431
PORTMAN HERE.

28
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:40,833
HE'S A MEMBER OF THE SENATE

29
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,367
FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE.

30
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,236
SENATOR ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU.

31
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:47,673
WHAT DO YOU MAKE, SIR, OF THESE

32
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,175
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS ON THE TRADE

33
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,977
FRONT, YOU KNOW, SOME DIVISION

34
00:00:51,977 --> 00:00:53,145
WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE WE'RE

35
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:57,216
TOLD AMONG GOING REALLY TOUGH,

36
00:00:57,216 --> 00:01:00,352
SORT OF THE NAVARRO ROUTE OR

37
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,286
MAINSTREAM MNUCHIN ROUTE?

38
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:02,688
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

39
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,256
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS

40
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,825
RIGHT TO FOCUS ON CHINA.

41
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:08,293
HE'S RIGHT TO SAY THAT THE

42
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:10,395
IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND

43
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:11,997
CHINA HAS GROWN OVER TIME.

44
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:14,233
AND BY THE WAY, OF THE $500

45
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:16,335
BILLION TRADE DEFICIT WE HAVE,

46
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:18,403
$370 BILLION IS WITH CHINA.

47
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:19,872
SO NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

48
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,474
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HE'S

49
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:24,610
FOCUSED ON WAS INTELLECTUAL

50
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:24,977
PROPERTY.

51
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:26,311
THE FACT THAT THEY TAKE OUR

52
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,247
SECRETS AND USE THEM.

53
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:29,615
SO IT'S REAL AND IT'S GOOD THAT

54
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:31,216
HE IS FINALLY SORT OF STANDING

55
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,017
UP TO IT.

56
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:33,752
NOT FINALLY HIM BUT FINALLY AN

57
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:35,120
AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION IS DOING

58
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,420
THAT.

59
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,122
BUT NEIL, YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

60
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:38,190
HOW YOU DO IT.

61
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,692
>> Neil: IN DOING SO, SENATOR,

62
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:43,929
HE'S WILLING TO OFFER AN OLIVE

63
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,697
BRANCH TO ZTE WHO HAS BEEN

64
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:47,733
STEALING SECRETS, DOING ALL THE

65
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,169
THINGS YOU JUST MENTIONED IN

66
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:52,371
ORDER TO EXTRACT A TRADE DEAL.

67
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:53,605
IT DOES SEEM WEIRD.

68
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:54,540
>> IT DOES SEEM WEIRD.

69
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,275
BECAUSE ZTE IS A COMPANY THAT

70
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:58,076
MAKES PHONES AND EVEN THE FBI

71
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,312
DIRECTOR, WRAY, THE NEW

72
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:01,814
DIRECTOR, TESTIFIED THIS WEEK

73
00:02:01,814 --> 00:02:02,915
THAT HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT

74
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,016
COUNTRIES THAT DON'T SHARE OUR

75
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:05,717
VALUES HAVING COMPANIES HERE IN

76
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:07,486
THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK.

77
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:10,255
SO THAT IS SORT OF INCONSISTENT

78
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,690
WITH WHAT I THINK WE'RE TRYING

79
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,792
TO DO WITH CHINA, WHICH IS TO

80
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:16,829
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE RECIPROCITY

81
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:19,398
AND A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD

82
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:20,833
WHICH WOULD INCLUDE

83
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,434
TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER

84
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,435
SOPHISTICATED KINDS OF

85
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:23,836
TECHNOLOGY.

86
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:25,404
I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

87
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:26,772
IF YOU GO TOO FAR, WHAT SOME

88
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,007
PEOPLE ARE SAYING, YOU MENTIONED

89
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,476
STEVE MNUCHIN, YOU WILL END UP

90
00:02:31,476 --> 00:02:32,778
SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT IF

91
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:37,216
YOU DO IN FACT HAVE THE CHINESE

92
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:38,217
RETAILATING AGAINST OUR

93
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:39,551
PROPERTIES AND WATER NOT GETTING

94
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:41,386
MORE ENTRY INTO THEIR MARKETS.

95
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:43,055
WE HAVE A BIGGER MARKET.

96
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:44,723
WE HAVE THE TRADE DEFICIT.

97
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:46,859
IN OTHER WORDS, ONLY SO MUCH

98
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:49,494
THEY CAN DO TO HURT OUR TRADE

99
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:51,730
BECAUSE THEY'RE SELLING US MORE

100
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,032
THAN WE'RE SELLING THEM.

101
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:55,334
>> Neil: BUT WHAT -- THE

102
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:56,835
PRESIDENT IS MEETING WITH CHINA

103
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:57,669
RIGHT NOW.

104
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:59,104
THE VICE PREMIER THIS HOUR.

105
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:01,039
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS COME

106
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,674
UP IS THIS HOW FAR DO WE PUSH

107
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:03,709
THE CHINESE?

108
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,510
PETER NAVARRO IS SAYING WE PUSH

109
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,013
THEM A LOT AND WE DO DO ANYTHING

110
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:10,082
WITH COMPANIES LIKE ZTE.

111
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,250
MNUCHIN, THE TREASURY SECRETARY,

112
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,652
SEEMS TO BE PART OF THAT MORE

113
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,821
TRADITIONAL APPROACH

114
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,855
INCREMENTALLY WE GET CONCESSIONS

115
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:17,489
FROM THEM.

116
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,291
EVEN IF IT MEANS MAKING A DEAL

117
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,226
ON ZTE, THE END JUSTIFY THE

118
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:21,560
MEANS.

119
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,228
WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS?

120
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:25,697
>> YEAH, FIRST OF ALL, ZTE IS A

121
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:26,498
SEPARATE ISSUE.

122
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,566
IT'S A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE.

123
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:29,701
>> Neil: I KNOW THAT.

124
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:31,637
THE PRESIDENT HAS LINKED IT.

125
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:33,739
>> THAT'S WHY -- YOU USED THE

126
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,208
WORD "WEIRD."

127
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,410
THESE A GOOD WAY TO PUT IT.

128
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,178
IT DOESN'T CONNECT WITH THE

129
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:40,779
TRADE ISSUE.

130
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:42,781
LET'S TALK ABOUT ZTE IS HANDLED

131
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:44,950
ON MERITS.

132
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,618
LET'S SAY THERE'S A NATIONAL

133
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:48,120
SECURITY CONCERN FROM WHAT WE

134
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,322
KNOW AND WHAT DIRECTOR WRAY

135
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:50,622
SAID.

136
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:51,957
BUT WITH REGARD TO TRADE,

137
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:54,559
THERE'S A BIG MIDDLE GROUND

138
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:54,860
HERE.

139
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,798
WITH REGARD TO CHINA, WE'RE

140
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:02,668
LOOKING FOR A LEVEL PLAYING

141
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:05,871
FIELD.

142
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:06,438
ORGANIZATION.

143
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:07,539
YOU HAVE TO LIVE BUT THEIR

144
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:07,839
RULES.

145
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:11,009
ONE OF THE ISSUES OF INVESTMENT,

146
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:12,377
THE CHINESE REQUIRE THERE'S

147
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,679
CHINESE OWNERSHIP.

148
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,579
THAT'S ONE THING THE PRESIDENT

149
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,548
HAS FOCUSED ON APPROPRIATELY.

150
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,817
ONE OF THE ISSUES, THE CHINESE,

151
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,786
51% OWNERS TAKE THE INTELLECTUAL

152
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:23,722
PROPERTY AND USE IT FOR ANOTHER

153
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,657
CHINESE COMPANY OR OTHERWISE

154
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:27,359
HAVE IT BE USED ON THE CHINESE

155
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:27,659
SIDE.

156
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:29,294
>> Neil: IT CAN BE MURKY.

157
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:30,362
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.

158
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:32,030
>> THAT'S APPROPRIATE TO GO

159
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,331
INTO.

160
00:04:32,331 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE'S A BILL MIDDLE GROUND
