America but us too I genuinely think

16
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,789
we've made the world a less safe place

by our recent interventions what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,969
Trump campaign is bringing in people

24
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,589
you've never voted in their lives the

25
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,689
problem he's got is he's also losing

26
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,810
people whose big Republican staff at

if Trump doesn't win what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,369
will happen I think if we're frank about

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,670
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trump isn't really a Republican</font>

32
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,159
candidate I mean almost nobody of the

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,500
Republican hierarchy is supposing it

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,450
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a it's a political</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> movement I think</font>

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,450
the hopes that he's put in the hearts of

disenfranchised that's not going to go

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,409
away and there'll be a battle if the

39
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,390
trumpets don't take it over that I I

40
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,280
think actually it may be genuinely

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,500
possible that we had a serious third
