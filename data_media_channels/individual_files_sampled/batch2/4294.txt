this is not a drill and this is not a normal news alert what I am reporting tonight what you may have heard about because it broke today is evidence of a potential crime committed by the president in plain sight the top story tonight and in many ways for the Russia probe the only story is public presidential conduct that would be unthinkable in any other era president Trump doing in public what got Richard Nixon in so much trouble when he did it in private something that would make any citizen without regard to party very concerned tonight allegedly abusing the power of office to try to shut down a probe into his own White House words that apply to Nixon and undid his presidency and words that are advanced tonight so let's get into this story you may know if you watch this news program we don't typically treat Donald Trump's tweets as news stories because most of them are not news many of them are not factual some of them are outright lies and a great many of them are ploys designed to hijack the conversation distract the media or troll the nation so let me explain upfront why we're doing something different tonight president Trump is telling the Attorney General to shut down the Moller probe he's stating it in public and in writing that Jeff Sessions quote should stop the probe now and to be clear if Donald Trump made that order in a private meeting with Jeff Sessions or on a phone call to DOJ or held a big press conference on the White House law the White House lawn and demanded it if any President did that it would be huge news it would be potential evidence of obstruction so here we do begin with this part of this story Donald Trump this is how he made the basic order writing the sessions who is of course recused from the Russia investigation under the guidance from the DOJ should quote stop it right now the top House Democrat investigating Russia responding by says this is quote an attempt to obstruct justice in plain sight and this comes just days after we learned that Bob Miller was looking at whether these other things that Trump does and says whether they occur on Twitter or wherever they occur are part of the elements of the case of obstruction of justice which according to at least past congresses is something that again I don't usually refer to out loud on this show but something the past congresses have found to be an impeachable offense so that is all the big news tonight what is Donald Trump's team doing about it well they're saying these words which I just reported which you can read which are out in the open aren't really what they say they are he used the word should he didn't use the word must and there was no presidential directive that followed it did in direct him he didn't direct him to do it that's all obstruction of justice thing it's nonsense he wanted to obstruct it it obstructed it it comes after Rudy Giuliani the president's lawyer on this probe has argued that when Trump does something on Twitter with 54 million people watching it happen that can't be bad first of all you know obstruction by tweet is not something that I think works real well generally obstruction is a secret its clandestine it's corrupt this is something we've reported on as well previously on this program the defense that something done in public would be sneakier done in private he's not a defense to the conduct it's just sort of a weird after the fact rationalization the idea that Trump shouldn't according to Giuliani have legal exposure for any mistakes or any crimes potential crimes that one commits in public and this obviously would be helpful to Donald Trump because of many things that he has done that are in question about this investigation have occurred in public he publicly admitted that he fired Comey with Russia on his mind he publicly suggested he could fire sessions for the same goals and he publicly asked a foreign government as we all now remember as an issue in this open case to hack his political rival Russia if you're listening I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing just because you do something that sounds bad looks bad or is potentially criminal out in the open on camera on Twitter wherever does not mean as a legal matter you can't be held accountable for it I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters okay it's like Donald Trump made that claim a sort of rhetorical gambit about a hypothetical murder with the idea that even that would be something his supporters would stand by that isn't usually a positive thing to say about other people and we don't know whether his supporters would stand by it what we do know in the matter of law is that kind of thing is not something that federal investigations will allow now in a moment I'm gonna be joined by Richard painter an ethics lawyer from the Bush administration who has a lot of thoughts about this but I begin with former federal prosecutor Cynthia ox Nia and Christian farias a legal writer for New York Magazine Cynthia this does seem significant is it an element of potential obstruction I don't think it's an element of obstruction I think it's something that goes in an obstruction indictment I think it's a statement of the president which is admissible I think it shows consciousness not only this but all the other tweets are show different levels of consciousness of guilt and they show and they're important for the proof of intent but they're no it's not I don't think it's a separate count and I say that because I think starting out real loyally when I say element I mean does it go to part of the obstruction evidence and the case of his intent and his goals I didn't say count oh sure I think it goes to I think it goes to intent and his goals I think there's plenty of obstruction evidence and there will be even more obstruction evidence good old-fashioned bread-and-butter obstruction evidence and then this will be part of the indictment and part of the evidence that is given to either a jury or in the in an impeachment trial but standing alone I don't think it's a count right I mean I know who cares whether it's a count you think it goes to let me bring Christian in I mean the question is whether this adds to the case against the president for potential obstruction of justice what would happen if a barack obama or george w bush or any other press out of the blue hood up in public in whatever medium on whatever way and said to their recused Attorney General shut down immediately the probe into my campaign people will be calling for his head we know that because we've seen it when he'd mentioned some things about the Hillary Clinton investigation and people's heads collectively exploded but here more importantly as a prosecutor was saying this is one piece of a larger puzzle that shows that there is certainly a consciousness of guilt this goes to the question of whether what's bothering the president so much that on the very same day that one of his former campaign chairman is going on trial he has the presence of mind to say these things it shut down the pro completely well as you say on the very week that the campaign chair is on child's the first trial that Moeller has has reached exactly and the fact that this has happened in the context of this and it's not even the main trial that Muller will be handling we know that there's a separate DC trial that where the stakes are much higher but that this is happening as all of these revelations are coming up during trial as prosecutors are in court preparing their arguments there's certainly something there that he is issue in this order to the Department of Justice which has control oversight over other prosecutors that certainly strengthen the case of obstruction I want you to vote to stay with me as promised I'm bringing in Richard painter chief White House Ethics lawyer and a Republican administration he is now running as a Democrat for the US Senate in Minnesota I go to you sir on this central question does this statement a count as evidence or an element of potential obstruction by Donald Trump well it's certainly evidence of obstruction of justice and first we really have to worry about the metal stability of our president when he is incriminating himself on Twitter and this is a very very damaging very incriminating tweet it's part of a long pattern of obstruction of justice he fired James Comey he has repeatedly tried to pressure jeff sessions to Unruh cues and fire robert muller and the prosecutor will find evidence of obstruction inside the White House I'm sure but you know the House and Senate Judiciary Committee should be investigating this we're way past the table we were 1973 with their investigating Richard Nixon and I'm shocked that there is no investigation for obstruction of justice abuse of power inators why do you think that tonight we're in a place that is past where we were with Nixon regarding presidential obstruction what what supports your view on that I think we were past that point when he fired James called me it was quite clear he fired James Comey in order to obstruct the Russia investigation and he admitted to that in front of the Russian ambassador in several TV interviews and we should have had hearings of the House and Senate Judiciary Committee at the same time that Robert Muller was hired and that's the way it was not in the Nixon days they had the House and Senate actually doing their jobs and investigating this is that a husband evidence of obstruction of justice court all the way back to the comedy firing at least it's shameful it's not being investigated he ought to be a he ought to be out of office by now hmm and I know that you speak as someone who's running for a Senate seat so we're getting a window into what you would do if in that body Cynthia take a listen to how Donald Trump used to say he would deal with these type of matters I said on the Department of Justice I would stay uninvolved now I may get involved at some point if it gets worse what does it say to you about the case against him if he is now getting more involved in the week of his campaign Chairman's trial you know I think there's a couple of reasons and they're they're pretty interesting legally one is the Giuliani dropped this little gem in his unhinged interview that they had sent a proposal to Muller's office in which the president would agree to testify and they had a proposal and it's been 11 days and they've heard nothing and I think that's freaking them out because what we know is of course that when a person moves from the subject of an investigation to the target of an investigation we don't send we don't subpoena them anymore and I think they're afraid that that's what's going on in now let's slow down even on that very important point we're making just so everyone's staying with you you're saying that the fact that Bob Muller's team is potentially no longer in active negotiations for an interview could suggest that their posture has changed from gathering information from the president as a subject which is bad but middle bad to not seeking his testimony because they view him as a target which is bad super bad exactly and I mean I think in addition I think they're playing with his head and Giuliani's head which isn't apparently that hard but by just not responding I think that has upped the pressure and the tension and then not only the fact of the mana fork trial but what happens in the course in the right before these trials is witness statements are turned over now Giuliani probably knows because the mana fort lawyers have given it to him he knows all kinds of information about what Gates is saying and that has also made him unhinged and then when he becomes unhinged his client becomes unhinged and the two of them behave in a very unprofessional and slightly ridiculous way right and you're putting your finger on that which goes to all the rumors that Giuliani started about this pre meeting that he claims didn't happen but he wanted to talk about anyway Christian which here on the beat with our legal experts we've referred to as a dinner that didn't occur but where sushi was served which is which is that paradoxical it's it's the legal version of an MC escher staircase and sort of Cynthia's point how much of this obvious freakout in your view from your reporting and your understanding is a product of recent things that Trump and Giuliani have learned that make them scared one thing that Trump team has learned is that bat mole or not just in Virginia but also in DC has put a lot of pressure a lot of trial tactics that should truly freak them out metaphor just dropped an appeal before the DC Circuit that shows that truly his lawyers are weary that his lawyers perhaps are getting tired by all this pressure that Muller is putting on them and ultimately of course Trump is verifiably freaked out that he might flip he was there at that time you think you think that sign here is were new flippin cuz we've been told many times well that's that's not in the cards don't called experts right even yesterday mana force lawyer said that no there's no way I'm cooperating with the special counsel and if anything all this just sticking to your guns if mana Ford's team shows that who knows maybe he's waiting for that little olive branch for Trump perhaps to suck to happen later and you've never heard mana for say anything bad about Trump at all whereas all these other witnesses and people who have flipped or who have pleaded guilty obviously are not in the president's graces anymore and it's very unlikely he'll pardon them but mana for he's still hanging on tight and that tells me something that perhaps Trump doesn't want him to do something that might incriminate him right brother hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see
