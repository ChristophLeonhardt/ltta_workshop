the BBC's comedy Commissioner has had a run-in with some of the broadcaster's legendary performers after saying that the days of sketches dominated by white male and elite educated comedians and now over suggesting that 70s hits like Monty Python wouldn't make it to the screen in today's Britain the BBC's unveiled a string of new shows fronted by female and ethnic minority comedians if you're going to assemble a team now it's not going to be six Oxbridge white blokes it's going to be a diverse range of people who reflect the modern world it's about how original the voice you have rather than what school you went to in the late 60s and 70s Monty Python attracted as many as 10 million British viewers per program known for their surreal humour their movies were even banned in several countries they've been called The Beatles of comedy and their influence reverberates even today what you want I want to come in and steal a few things madam you know madam I'm a burglar burgle people you're so me encyclopedias I just want to come in ransack the flat honestly none at all Python original John please head back at the BBC in his own idiosyncratic style BBC's head of comedy puts monty python's lack of originality down to a surfeit of education and racist bias unfair we're remarkably diverse for our time we had free grammar school boys wanna put and gilliam though not actually black was a Yank and no slave owners or we've asked people in London if they've thought Monty Python had a place in today's world younger generation that grew up in a completely different time looking back in judging old comedy by today's standards I think you can really do that and it's such classic TV that and the likes of Fawlty Towers you've got all those classics that we've had in the eighties and the seventies they want to keep going because there are timeless pieces of artwork if you go back and listen to old Monty Python it's I mean even now I would find some of it shocking it's you know we are losing the sort of really edgy shock humor that we used to have I guess it's about driving up fine balance between you know what's funny and what could potentially offend someone you
