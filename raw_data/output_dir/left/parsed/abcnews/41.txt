TODAY WE'VE INTERVIEWED BETWEEN 
THE FBI, THE BROWARD SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE AND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT 
OF INVESTIGATORS FROM MANY OTHER
AGENCIES, A LOT OF LOCAL LAW 
ENFORCEMENT.
SO OVER 2,000 PEOPLE WERE 
INTERVIEWED AND WE CONTINUE.
THIS WAS A FLUID INVESTIGATION.
WE HAVE SO MANY FACTS COMING IN.
SOME TRUE, SOME UNSUBSTANTIATED.
SOME RUMORS.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TIME
TO SIFT THROUGH WHAT'S ACCURATE 
AND WHAT'S NOT.
I WANTED TO HONOR DECEASED 
VICTIMS OF THIS HORRIFIC 
KILLING.
I'M GOING TO DO MY BEST TO 
PRONOUNCE THE NAMES ACCURATELY.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF I DON'T 
PRONOUNCE THE NAMES EXACTLY HOW 
THE FAMILIES DO BUT I THOUGHT 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
I WANT TO PAY HOMAGE TO THE 
FAMILIES AND THE VICTIMS.
CARMEN, MEADOW POLLAK.

THE FIREARMS.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
ON BEHALF OF THE MEN AND WOMEN, 
I WANT TO EXTEND MY CONDOLENCES 
TO THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS 
AND THE PEOPLE OF THE COMMUNITY.
AND YOU'LL KEEP IN YOUR PRAYERS 
THE FIRST RESPONDERS.
I CAN TELL YOU IT WAS A 
DIFFICULT ONE.
THE FIREARM THAT WAS UTALIZED IN
THIS EVENT WAS PURCHASED 
LAWFULLY JUST SHORT OF A YEAR 
AGO BY THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS 
CHARGED WITH THIS CRIME.
WE'RE HERE TO HELP THE BROWARD 
COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE TO 
FOLLOW UP ON ANY LEADS THAT MAY 
PERTAIN TO THE FIREARM AND I ASK
THAT YOU KEEP THE FAMILIES AND 
VICTIMS IN YOUR THOUGHTS AND 
PRAYERS AS WE GET THROUGH THESE 
DIFFICULT DAYS.
THANK YOU.
>> SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE ASKED
ABOUT TIPS RECEIVED REGARDING 
THE SUSPECT.
MR. LASKY'S GOING TO EXPOUND ON 
SOME OF THAT INFORMATION.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE
TIP WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS MORNING.
ON SEPTEMBER 25TH, 2017, THE FBI
FIELD OFFICE OF JACKSON, 
MISSISSIPPI RECEIVED A TIP ABOUT
A COMMENT POSTED TO A YOUTUBE 
ACCOUNT BY SOMEONE WITH A USER 
NAME, NICOLAS CRUZ SPELLED, 
N-I-K-O IS C-U-R-Z.
IT SAID I'M GOING TO BE A 
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL SHOOTDER.
THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PARTICULAR
TIME, INFORMATION OR FURTHER 
IDENTIFIERS ABOUT THE PERSON WHO
POSTED THE COMMENT.
THE COMPLAINANT HAD HAD PROVIDED
THE SAME INFORMATION TO YOUTUBE.
YOUTUBE REMOVED THE COMMENTS.
AFTER RECEIVING THIS 
INFORMATION, FBI JACKSON DID NOT
DO AN INTERVIEW OF THE PERSON 
WHO MADE THE COMPLAINT.
THIS PERSON LIVES IN 
MISSISSIPPI.
HAS NO CONNECTION TO SOUTH 
FLORIDA.
AND HAS NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE 
PERSON WHO POSTED THE COMMENT.
THE FBI ALSO CONDUCTED IFTERNAL 
DATA BASE REVIEWS AND OPEN 
SOURCE CHECKS.
NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS 
FOUND TO POSITIVELY IDENTIFY THE
PERSON WHO POSTED THIS COMMENT.
THERE WAS NO CONNECTION FOUND TO
SOUTH FLORIDA.
MOVING FORWARD, WE WILL CONTINUE
TO GATHER ARE HAD INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE SUBJECT AS WE TRY TO 
IDENTIFY HIS MOTIVES, HIS HAD 
ASSOCIATES AND HIS ACTIONS 
LEADING UP TO YESTERDAY'S 
EVENTS.
WE ARE LOOKING INTO HIS SOCIAL 
MEDIA POSTS, HIS HAD MOVEMENTS, 
HIS CONVERSATIONS LEADING UP TO 
THE SHOOTING AS WELL AS ANY 
OTHER INDICATORS THAT MAY BE OUT
THERE.
AGAIN MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE 
VICTIMS, THE FAMILIES AND THE 
FRIENDS AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO 
SUFFERED BY THIS COWARDLY AND 
HORRIFIC ACT.
SHERIFF.
>> I WANT TO TAKE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO THANK THIS 
AMAZING GROUP OF PEOPLE FLANKING
ME, YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO 
CAME FROM PLACES AS FAR AS 
WASHINGTON D.C., TALLAHASSEE AND
JUST CAME DOWN HERE.
IT CALLS I RECEIVED FROM 
CONGRESSMAN WAUSERMAN SCHULTZ, 
AND ARE ON AND ON AND ON, I 
CAN'T THANK THEM ENOUGH.
THEY JUST WANT TO SEE SAFETY IN 
BROWARD COUNTY.
TO ALL OF YOU, THANK YOU.
WE WILL BE GOING OVER -- I WILL 
BE GOING OVER AT 6:00 TONIGHT TO
A VIGIL FOR THOSE THAT PASSED 
AWAY.
I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE GOING TO 
HEED MY REMARKS AND I KNOW SOME 
OF YOU ARE NOT.
BUT I'M GOING TO SAY THEM 
ANYWAY.
YOU NEED TO RESPECT THE PRIVACY 
OF THESE FAMILIES.
THESE FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH
THE MOST HORRIFIC TIME ENTHEIR 
LIVES AND IF THEY SAY THEY DON'T
WANT TO TALK TO YOU, RESPECT 
THEM, DON'T MOVE FORWARD WITH 
YOUR CAMERA, YOUR MICROPHONE.
LET THESE FAMILIES HEAL, PLEASE 
HONOR THEM.
MANY HAVE CALLED ME AND ASKED ME
TO TRANSFER THIS MESSAGE AND I 
HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER LISTENING.
SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT.
PLEASE RESPECT THESE FAMILIES.
THEY LOST CHILDREN.
THEY LOST LOVED ONES.
COULD YOU IMAGINE WHAT THEY'RE 
GOING THROUGH?
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
ANY QUESTIONS?
>> DID HE BELONG TO A WHITE 
NATIONALIST GROUP -- 
>> WE'VE HEARD THAT, WE'RE 
LOOKING INTO THAT.
AND WE'LL JUST KEEP FOLLOWING 
ON.
>> . 
>> HE MIGHT HAVE.
I DON'T KNOW AT THIS TIME.
>> HOW DOES THAT FIT IN THE 
NARRATIVE?
>> IT FITS IN PERFECTLY.
HE COULD HAVE SHOT THEM, HE 
COULD HAVE BEEN WITHIN THE 
SCHOOL, THEY COULD HAVE BEEN 
OUTSIDE.
THIS IS A POWERFUL RIFLE AND 
COULD HAVE EASILY GONE THROUGH A
DOOR OR SHOT WHILE THE DOOR WAS 
OPEN.
SO WE'RE STILL EXAMINING VIDEO.
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE ASKED 
OURSELVES.
WITHIN A DAY OR TWO WE'LL HAVE 
THE EXACT ANSWER FOR THAT.
>> IT CERTAINLY COULD.
>> YES.
HE BROUGHT A WEAPON IN CARL 
SPRINGS AT A DEALERSHIP CALLED 
SUNRISE TACTICAL.
I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT RELEASING 
ANY VIDEO.
WE MIGHT RELEASE INFORMATION 
I'LL CAPTURE OR RECOVER FROM THE
VIDEO.
BUT AT THIS TIME I HAVE NO PLANS
TO RELEASE ANY TYPE OF 
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.
AND I WANT TO -- I'M JUST GOING 
TO GIVE WAY TO THE MIKE TO 
SUPERINTENDANT AND THEN I'LL 
COME BACK TO THE MICROPHONE.
>> LET ME FIRST SAY ON BEHALF OF
THE SCHOOLBOARD MEMBERS AND 
MYSELF, OUR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS
HERE TODAY JUST REITERATING WHAT
THE SHERIFF HAS SAID PLEASE 
RESPECT THE PRIVACY OF THE 
FAMILIES AS THEY GO THROUGH THIS
HORRIFIC SITUATION.
WE CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH.
IF YOU COULD HONOR THEM AND 
RESPECT THEM DURING THESE 
CRITICAL TIMES.
WE'VE HAD HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE 
TODAY THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH 
CRISIS SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDED
AT SEVERAL LOCATIONS, TWO HERE 
IN PARKLAND.
TWO IN CARL SPRINGS.
WE'LL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THOSE 
AS NECESSARY.
AGAIN THE SCHOOL IS CLOSED FROM 
NOW THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND.
WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING THE 
NEXT COUPLE DAYS FIGURING OUT 
WHAT THE PATH IS AND WHAT TYPE 
OF LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES 
RELATIVE TO WHAT'S ON BUILDING 
12 ON THE SITE.
WE WILL BE PROVIDING IT OUT TO 
THE PARENTS AND FAMILIES IN THE 
COMMUNITY AND MEDIA AS WELL.
THANK YOU FOR RESPECTING OUR 
FAMILIES.
GIVE THEM THE SPACE AND 25TIME  
GREAVE AND GET THROUGH THIS VERY
DIFFICULT SPACE IN TIME.
>> HAVE YOU FOUND ANY REASON FOR
THEM?
>> THAT'S WHAT OUR DETECTIVES 
AND THE FBI ARE DOING.
WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO HIM AND 
GATHERING THAT INFORMATION.
BUT I CAN'T ENLIGHTEN YOU ON 
THAT RIGHT NOW.
WELL, HE WAS DROPPED OFF BY AN 
UBER VEHICLE AND LET ME SAY THIS
AT THIS POINT THE DRIVER IS NOT 
COMPLICIT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR 
FORM.
THE DRIVER JUST SIMPLY PECKED UP
A FAIR AND DROPPED THE FAIR 
OFF -- 
>> Reporter: THAT WAS THE 
SHERIFF HERE IN BROWARD COUNTY 
ADDRESSING REPORTERS MOMENTS AGO
AND DESCRIBING IN GREAT DETAIL 
HOW THIS SUSPECT METHODICALLY 
WENT THROUGH THAT HIGH SCHOOL IN
PARKLAND, FOUR SEPARATE 
CLASSROOMS.
SOMETIMES REPEATING HIMSELF BY 
GOING BACK THOCLASSROOM.
LET'S REJOIN IT SHERIFF.
>> AT THIS POINT THERE ARE OTHER
PEOPLE WE WANT TO CERTAINLY TALK
TO, PEOPLE OF INTEREST THAT 
MIGHT ENLIGHTEN US AS TO WHY HE 
DID WHAT HE DID.
BUT AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO 
ACCOMPLICE OR ANYBODY ELSE WE'RE
LOOKING AT FROM THAT 
PERSPECTIVE.
>> I'M SORRY.
>> WEARING A GAS MASK AND 
THERE'S NO MENTION OF THAT -- 
CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING MORE 
ABOUT THAT?
>> I HAVE NO REASON -- I HAVEN'T
SEEN THE VIDEOS YET.
I'M GOING TO BE BRIEFED TOMORROW
ON THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT HE
HAD ON A MASK AT ANY TIME.
>> -- FEAR OF THE TEACHERS HE 
MIGHT BRING A WEAPON IN THE 
SCHOOL?
>> I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE.
>> . 
>> ARE HAD THE VICTIMS ARE AT 
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE 
AND RIGHT NOW THE MEDICAL 
EXAMINER IS DOING A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION.
WE WANT TO RELEASE THE VICTIMS 
TO THEIR FAMILIES.
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SABTH IS 
TOMORROW AND WE'RE VERY 
COGNIZANT OF THAT BUT THE MAIN 
THING WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE
THERE'S A SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION
AND WE WANT TO GO AS FAST AS WE 
CAN BUT ACCURATE IS BETTER THAN 
SPEED.
THE SCHOOL IS A CRIME SCENE AND 
WE'RE EXAMINING THE CRIME SCENE.
THANK YOU.
THAT I READ OUT?
NO.
FOR ARE ADULTS ON THE LIST AS 
WELL.
>> THE FAMILY YOU'RE STAYING 
WITH, DID THEY NOTICE ANYTHING 
LIKE THAT?
>> I'M NOT SURE AT THIS TIME.
>> I'VE NEVER HEARD -- THE FIRST
GENTLEMAN YOU NAMED, I'VE 
NEVERURD HEARD HIS NAME BEFORE.
>> THAT IS THE BROWARD COUNTY 
SHERIFF ADDRESSING REPORTERS 
AGAIN TODAY.
THEY'VE NOW REVEALED IN 
PARKLAND, FLORIDA, THE TIMELINE 
AND MORE ABOUT NIKOLAS CRUZ D 
SCRIBING HOW HE ARRIVED TO 
SCHOOL IN AN UBER AND TARGETING 
FOUR CLASSROOMS, SOMETIMES 
FIRING INTO THE CLASSROOM, 
RETURNING AND FIRING AGAIN, 
GOING TO THE STAIR WELL AND 
ANOTHER CLASSROOM, 1234, THEY 
KNOW EACH OF THESE ROOMS 
SPECIFICALLY BEFORE HITTING 
ANOTHER STAIR WELL AND LOOEVING 
THE BUILDING.
THEY DESCRIBED HOW HE TRIED TO 
LEAVE AND BLEND IN WITH THE 
OTHER STUDENTS EVACUATING.
THIS IS A SCHOOL THAT HAD HAD 
JUST DONE DRILLS AND HAD A FIRE 
ALARM EARLIER IN THE DAY.
IT'S BELIEVED THAT SECOND FIRE 
ALARM WADS TRIGGERED BY THE 
SUSPECT.
AND DOWN HERE IN FLORIDA 
COVERING THIS FROM THE START FOR
US.
WE KNOW NIKOLAS CRUZ WAS IN 
COURT TODAY AND WE LEARNED QUITE
A BIT NOT ONLY FROM HOW FEW 
WORDS HE SPOKE BUT FROM THE 
AFFIDAVIT OF HIS COURT 
APPEARANCE.
.
>> ACCORDING TO AN AFFIDAVIT, 
WE'VE SEEN THAT ACCORDING TO 
INVESTIGATORS AFTER HE WAS READ 
HIS MIRANDA RIGHTS ONCE HE WAS 
ARRESTED HE ALLEGEDLY CONFESSED 
TO KILLING ALL 17 OF THOSE 
PEOPLE AT THAT HIGH SCHOOL.
AS YOU MENTIONED TODAY WE DID 
SEE HIM HAD IN COURT EARLIER.
WE LEARNED FROM HIS ATTORNEY 
THAT HE IS NOW ON SUICIDE WATCH.
SO HE'S BEING MONITORED VERY 
CLOSELY BY POLICE.
EARLIER TODAY I WENT TO THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD IN SOUTH FLORIDA 
WHERE HE SPENT MORE THAN 10 
YEARS AND IT'S A VERY NORMAL 
NEIGHBORHOOD.
BUT NEIGHBOR AFTER NEIGHBOR SAID
THE ONE THING THAT WAS ABNORMAL 
WAS NICKEROUS RR CRUZ.
A VERY NICE NEIGHBORHOOD.
BUT ONE NEIGHBOR WHO LIVED JUST 
A FEW DOORS DOWN WHO GREW UP 
WITH NIKOLAS CRUZ, A TEENAGER 
TOLD ME HE DESCRIBED NIKOLAS 
THIS WAY AGGRESSIVE, CRAZY, 
WEIRD, A PSYCHO.
AS A LITTLE BOY HE CORNERED A 
SQUIRREL AND WAS TRYING TO KILL 
IT WITH ROCKS.
ANOTHER NEIGHBOR TOLD ME HE 
WOULD TAKE A PELLET GUN AND TRY 
TO KILL CHICKENS.
HE WOULD ROAM THE STREETS IN A 
CAMOUFLAGE JACKET FROM A CHILD 
TO HIS TEEN AGE YEARS.
HE ALWAYS STOOD OUT.
THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING JUST 
OFF ABOUT HIM. 
>> Reporter: THERE SEEMS TO BE 
SO MANY TROUBLING WARNING SIGNS 
ALONG THE WAY.
LOST HIS FATHER EARLY, LOST HIS 
MOTHER TO THE FLU LATE LAST 
YEAR.
A LOT OF TRAUMA LEADING TO ALL 
OF THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT WARNING
SIGNS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 
MISSED ALONG THE WAY.
YOU HEARD THE SHERIFF SAY 
MOMENTS AGO THAT THIS WEAPON WAS
BOUGHT HERE IN FLORIDA LEGALLY 
IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THINK ABOUT ARE HAD TOM 
DESCRIBED ABOUT HOW UNUSUAL THIS
MAN WAS, ABOUT ALL IT WARNING 
SIGNS KNOWN AT THE SCHOOL AND 
CONFIRMED OUT RIGHT THAT HE 
BOUGHT THAT GUN LEGALLY AT A GUN
STORE IN BROWARD COUNTY.
WENT IN NO CRIMINAL RECORD TO 
SPEAK OF, BOUGHT IT GUN AND WAS 
ABLE TO DO ALL THAT CARNAGE, 
DAVID.
>> WITH NO BACKGROUND CHECK 
SHOWING UP ANY KIND OF MENTAL 
HEALTH ISSUES IN THE PAST.
GUNS.
>> AND HE DID NOT ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION ABOUT GUN CONTROL IF 
NOW IS THE TIME TO START TALKING
ABOUT THAT.
MENTAL HEALTH SEEMS TO BE THE 
FOCUS FOR THIS PRESIDENT, RATHER
AT THIS HOUR.
HE IS CALLING THE SHOOTER 
MENTALLY DISTURBED.
WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
MAKING PLANS TO VISIT PARKLAND, 
TEXAS, IT'S UNCLEAR WHEN, IT 
COULD BE THIS WEEKEND, WHEN 
WE'RE TOLD THAT HE IS SCHEDULED 
TO GO TO MAR-A-LAGO.
BUT WHILE THE PRESIDENT IS NOT 
RIGHT NOW ANSWERING QUESTIONS, 
DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT GUN 
CONTROL, THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS
OFTEN IN THE WAKE OF THESE OTHER
SHOOTINGS, THESE OTHER TRAGEDIES
WE'VE SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY, THEY
SAID IT IS TOO SOON TO TALK 
ABOUT THOSE ISSUES, BUT WE ARE 
HEARING FROM FAMILY MEMBERS ON 
THE GROUND THERE IN PARKLAND, 
WHERE YOU ARE, GUT-WRENCHING 
STORIES, CALLS FOR HELP, AND 
DIRECT CRIES AND DEMANDS, 
FRANKLY, OF THIS WHITE HOUSE TO 
DO SOMETHING.
ONE MOTHER OF A 14-YEAR-OLD 
YOUNG GIRL KILLED IN THAT 
SHOOTING THERE, DAVID, HER 
MOTHER TELLS PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DIRECTLY, YOU CAN DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT THIS.
SO, THOSE ARE THE CRIES WE ARE 
HEARING FROM DOWN THERE, DAVID.
WE'LL SEE WHAT THIS WHITE HOUSE 
DOES, HOW THEY ANSWER THOSE.
>> ALL RIGHT, CECILIA VEGA LIVE 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR US.
CECILIA, THANK YOU.
AND ONE MORE POWERFUL MOMENT, 
JUST MOMENTS AGO HERE, THE 
SHERIFF GOING DOWN THE LIST, THE
17 NAMES.
AND WE HAVE SOME OF THOSE IMAGES
TONIGHT.
A REMINDER OF REALLY WHY WE'RE 
HERE.
17 FAMILIES WHOSE LIVES HAVE 
BEEN CHANGED FOREVER.
LOSING THEIR LOVED ONES.
13 OF THE FACES RIGHT THERE ON 
YOUR SCREEN.
THE SHERIFF GOING DOWN THEIR 
NAMES, ONE BY ONE HERE.
A REMINDER ABOUT WHY THIS 
COUNTRY IS BEING PUSHED BY MANY 
OF THE FAMILIES HERE, MANY OF 
THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMUNITY, 
AS CECILIA POINTED OUT, TO ACT 
AND DO SOMETHING.
WE'LL HAVE TEAM COVERAGE ON 
"WORLD NEWS TONIGHT" LIVE FROM 
PARKLAND, FLORIDA, TONIGHT.
IN THE MEANTIME, I'M DAVID MUIR.
GOOD DAY.
>> THIS HAS BEEN A SPECIAL 
REPORT FROM ABC NEWS.
