OF PROSPERITY.
WE FINALLY HAVE A PRESIDENT IN
THE WHITE HOUSE WHO BELIEVES IN
THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY.
LELAND: McMASTER'S OPPONENT JOHN
WARREN JOINS US FROM THE STREETS
OF MYRTLE BEACH, SOUTH CAROLINA.
APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US,
SIR, THANK YOU.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, GLAD TO BE
HERE.
LELAND: AFTERNOON TO YOU.
I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THIS,
THE PRESIDENT'S GOT LONG
COATTAILS IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
IT WAS HIS TWEET THAT HELPED
KNOCK OFF A SITTING U.S.
CONGRESSMAN IN A PRIMARY
ELECTION.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO COMBAT THE
VICE-PRESIDENT AND THE
PRESIDENT, AIR FORCE ONE MAKES
AN AWFUL LOT OF NOISE WHEN IT
COMES TO TOWN.
STUMPING FOR YOUR OPPONENT?
>> WELL, THE PRESIDENT IS VERY
POPULAR IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND I
CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS NOT
A REFERENDUM ON HIM.
SOUTH CAROLINA SUPPORTS THE
PRESIDENT.
I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT.
BUT THIS IS A REFERENDUM ON
GOVERNOR McMASTER AND HIS FAILED
LEADERSHIP.
HE'S BEEN PARTNERED TO A
CRIMINAL FOR 30 YEARS IN RICHARD
QUINN, WHO IS A CHIEF
CONSULTANT.
WE'RE READY FOR A CHANGE HERE.
WE'RE READY FOR SOMEONE WITH
COMPETENCE WHO IS GOING TO
REPRESENT THE TAXPAYER AND
THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING.
LELAND: I'VE HEARD THAT
ACCUSATION BEFORE AND IN ONE OF
YOUR SOUND BITES AND A LOT OF
YOUR INTERVIEWS YOU SAY PEOPLE
ARE TIRED OF THE CORRUPTION.
THAT'S A PRETTY SERIOUS CHARGE.
ARE YOU ACTUALLY SAYING THE
GOVERNOR HIMSELF IS CORRUPT?
AND IF SO, WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU
HAVE?
>> I'M SAYING THAT A LOT OF
PEOPLE THAT SURROUND THEMSELVES
WITH THE GOVERNOR ARE CORRUPT.
WE'VE HAD FOUR LEGISLATORS SINCE
2014 INDICTED WHO HAVE RESIGNED
IN DISGRACE.
THREE OF THE FOUR SHARE THE
EXACT SAME CHIEF POLITICAL
CONSULTANT AS THE GOVERNOR, AND
WE HAVE A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN.
SO WE'VE GOT TO HAVE NEW BLOOD.
WE NEED A BUSINESSMAN, A
IN THERE AND CHANGE SOUTH
CAROLINA FOR THE BETTER.
LELAND: LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF
THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO DEAL WITH.
ONE THING THAT AFFECTS SOUTH
CAROLINA, PERHAPS
DISPROPORTIONATELY IS TARIFFS
AND THE RECIPROCAL TARIFFS BEING
PLACED BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S POLICIES.
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO
STAND UP TO THE PRESIDENT AND
SAY, THE TARIFFS MIGHT BE GOOD
FOR HIM, BUT THEY'RE NOT GOOD
FOR SOUTH CAROLINA?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S DONE
AN AMAZING JOB WITH TAX REFORM,
WITH GETTING A SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE, WITH WINNING THE COLD
WAR IN KOREA.
ONE AREA I WOULD DISAGREE WITH
THE PRESIDENT ON IS TARIFFS AND
GOVERNOR McMASTER HAS DISAGREED
WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THAT
ISSUE.
AND WE HAVE SO MUCH INDUSTRY.
I WITH AS IN SOMERVILLE AND THEY
IMPORT STEEL BECAUSE THE
AMERICAN STEEL INDUSTRY IS NOT
UP TO CODE AND NOT UP TO PAR AND
TARIFFS HURT PEOPLE IN SOUTH
CAROLINA.
LELAND: AS YOU NOTED, GOVERNOR
McMASTER WHO CALLS HIMSELF A
FRIEND TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING THERE
TO STUMP FOR HIM, WASN'T ENOUGH
TO CHANGE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
MIND.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY TO
PROTECT PEOPLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA
FROM THE TARIFFS YOU JUST SAID
WERE NO DAMAGING?
>> WELL, I MEAN, HE LOOK FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP
COME JANUARY, WHEN I'M GOVERNOR,
AND I THINK I'LL HAVE A GREAT
WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.
LELAND: OKAY.
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT MY--
WHEN YOU LOOK AT MY RESUME' WITH
COMPARED TO GOVERNOR McMASTER,
I'M THE BUSINESSMAN, HE'S THE
CAREER POLITICIAN, THIS IS HIS
EIGHTH STATEWIDE RACE.
LELAND: MR. WARREN, I APPRECIATE
THAT, BUT WHAT ARGUMENTS ARE YOU
GOING TO TAKE TO THE PRESIDENT
THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE
ARGUMENTS THAT MR. McMASTER,
QUOTE, UNQUOTE, HIS FRIEND TOOK,
AND WHY SHOULD THE PRESIDENT
THEN LISTEN TO YOU?
>> WELL, I THINK WHAT I'LL DO,
I'LL TRY TO SHOW PRESIDENT TRUMP
THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE AFFECTED
WITH THE TARIFFS.
I EXPECT TO HAVE A GREAT
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM AND THAT'S
WHAT LEADERS DO.
THEY SHARE IDEAS, THEY ACTUALLY
SHOW EVIDENCE AND THAT'S WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO AS GOVERNOR.
LELAND: ALL RIGHT, MR. WARREN,
WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US.
I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG,
HOT SLOG TO THE FINISH LINE ON
TUESDAYMENT WE WISH YOU LUCK AND
