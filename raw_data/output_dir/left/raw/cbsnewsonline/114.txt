1
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:08,441
MEET WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN? 

2
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:10,110
BUT I THINK THAT YOU ASKED TWO 

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,377
QUESTIONS AND IT IS YES TO EACH 

4
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:12,378
OF THEM THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH 

5
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:13,613
THAT AND MEET WITH LESS-THAN-

6
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,414
PERFECT CITIZENS OF THE WORLD 

7
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,715
AND MOVE THE BALL IN THE RIGHT 

8
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,050
DIRECTION BUT I THINK IT WAS 

9
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,884
MORE THAN APPROPRIATE THAT THE 

10
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:18,785
PRESIDENT MEET WITH VLADIMIR 

11
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:19,085
PUTIN. 

12
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,320
>> MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION IS 

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,120
THAT WE NEED TO DE-ESCALATE 

14
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,155
SOME OF THE PARTISAN TENSIONS 

15
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,356
IN OUR COUNTRY I LOOK TOWARDS 

16
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,390
WAYS THAT WE CAN HAVE 

17
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,991
DISCUSSIONS WITH FOREIGN 

18
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,559
LEADERS AND NOT BE SO 

19
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,159
SIMPLISTIC THAT SOMEHOW THEY 

20
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,228
HAVE TO HAVE A PERFECT RECORD 

21
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,862
OR THAT WE HAVE TO SHOUT AND 

22
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:36,402
SCREAM. I THINK THAT BACK TO 

23
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:37,570
REAGAN TALKING TO GORBACHEV, HE 

24
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,805
SAID TEAR DOWN THE WALL AND 

25
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:39,639
CALL THEM AN EVIL EMPIRE. 

26
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:40,840
I DO NOT IMAGINE HIM SITTING 

27
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,841
DOWN AND YELLING AND SHAKING 

28
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,143
HIS FIST AND SAYING MURDERER 

29
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:47,947
AND A THUG AND RESTATE RECITING 

30
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:48,848
THE STALL IN'S HUMAN RIGHTS 

31
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,383
ABUSES BUT I THINK THERE IS A 

32
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,284
DIFFERENCE FOR ANYBODY THAT HAS 

33
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,018
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS BETWEEN 

34
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,319
SITTING DOWN AND HOW DIPLOMACY 

35
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:53,953
WOULD OCCUR BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS 

36
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,054
AND RECITING A LITANY OF HUMAN 

37
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:55,688
RIGHTS ABUSES.  

38
00:00:55,688 --> 00:01:00,326
IN THAT VEIN, I THINK THAT 

39
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,062
THERE IS A -- THERE SEEMS TO BE 

40
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,163
A LIMITLESS APPETITE FOR MORE 

41
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:03,463
SANCTIONS. 

42
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,129
MAYBE INSUFFICIENT INTEREST IN 

43
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:04,797
DESCRIBING WHAT ACTIONS ARE 

44
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:17,877
NEEDED TO REMOVE SANCTIONS. 

45
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:18,611
SO SENATOR RUBIO MENTIONED THIS 

46
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,245
DETER ACT. 

47
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,647
I GUESS MY CONCERN WAS SOME OF 

48
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,948
THIS -- WITH SOME OF THIS IS 

49
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:22,882
THAT THE DEFINITION OF WHO 

50
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:23,983
MIGHT BE MEDDLING IN AN 

51
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,118
ELECTION IN OUR COUNTRY IS NOT 

52
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,119
LIMITED TO JUST RUSSIA. 

53
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,120
IT COULD INCLUDE ALLIES THAT 

54
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,254
SPEND MONEY ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN 

55
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,489
OUR COUNTRY BUT IT DOES NOT 

56
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,189
SEEM TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN 

57
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:31,191
SOCIAL MEDIA AND ACTUALLY 

58
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,091
HACKING INTO OUR ELECTORAL 

59
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,226
SYSTEM AND CHANGING THOUSANDS 

60
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:55,615
OF VOTES. 

61
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,983
IT TAKES THE POWER AWAY FROM 

62
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,017
THE PRESIDENT AND GIVES IT TO 

63
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,018
THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 

64
00:01:59,018 --> 00:01:59,351
INTELLIGENCE. 

65
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:00,553
THIS IS THE DETER ACT WE WERE 

66
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:00,920
TALKING ABOUT. 

67
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,288
I KNOW THAT YOU INDICATED THAT 

68
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,289
SANCTIONS ARE A GOOD IDEA TO 

69
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:03,690
DETER THEM. 

70
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,525
TO THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO 

71
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,859
TAKE THE SANCTION POWER, GIVE 

72
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,228
IT TO THE DAY AND I AND THEN 

73
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,195
THE SANCTIONS HAVE TO REMAIN IN 

74
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,597
PLACE FOR 8 HOURS WITH THE 

75
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,431
PRESIDENT NOT HAVING ANY 

76
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,632
ABILITY TO DECIDE IF THERE HAS 

77
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,700
BEEN SOME KIND OF CHANGE IN 

78
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,701
BEHAVIOR BY THE MALEFACTORS? 

79
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,501
>> WITHOUT HAVING SEEN THE 

80
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,536
LEGISLATION, I DO NOT THINK 

81
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,704
THAT IS A GOOD IDEA. 

82
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:18,838
>> I LIKE YOUR STATEMENT WHERE 

83
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:19,739
YOU SAID, THE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

84
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:20,974
BELIEVES THAT NOW IS THE TIME 

85
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,008
FOR DIRECT COMMUNICATION IN OUR 

86
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,209
RELATIONSHIP IN ORDER TO MAKE 

87
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,010
CLEAR TO PRESIDENT PUTIN THAT 

88
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,245
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY TO 

89
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,246
REVERSE THE NEGATIVE COURSE OF 

90
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,347
OUR RELATIONSHIP I THINK BACK 

91
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,581
AT THE HEART OF WHY WE HAVE 

92
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,014
THESE DISCUSSIONS. 

93
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:30,316
IF YOU KEEP SANCTIONS ON A 

94
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,551
CONGRESS PUTS THEM ON AND THEY 

95
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,752
HAVE TO STAY ON FOR EIGHT YEARS 

96
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,187
AND NEVER COME UP, IF THERE IS 

97
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,722
NO OFF-RAMP, IF THERE IS NO 

98
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:36,322
DISCUSSION, THAT IS WHAT 

99
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,323
DIPLOMACY IS SUPPOSED TO BE 

100
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,525
ABOUT THE I COMMEND YOU FOR 

101
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,325
TALKING TO KIM JONG-UN. 

102
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,693
ARE WE HERE TO EXTOL HIS RECORD 

103
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:41,794
ON HUMAN RIGHTS? 

104
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:42,161
OBVIOUSLY NOT. 

105
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,429
AT THE SAME TIME FOR SANCTIONS 

106
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,931
TO HAVE AN EFFECT, YOU HAVE TO 

107
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:45,331
HAVE NEGOTIATION. 

108
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,399
I WOULD SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES 

109
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,400
THAT HAVE BEEN ALL OVER 

110
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,301
TELEVISION, SAYING THAT THERE 

111
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,435
SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MEETING. 

112
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,470
THINK AGAIN JUST KEEPING THE 

113
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,671
SANCTIONS ON AND YOU DO NOT 

114
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,872
WANT TO THE AUTHORITY TO TALK 

115
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,274
TO THE ADVERSARY ABOUT HOW WE 

116
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,307
WOULD ACTUALLY REMOVE THE 

117
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:59,045
SANCTIONS BEHAVIOR CHANGES. 

118
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,279
YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE 

119
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:00,646
COMMUNICATIONS. 

120
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:01,781
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT WE 

121
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,815
HAVE AIRPLANES FLYING WITHIN A 

122
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,983
MILE OR WITHIN 100 YARDS OF 

123
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,184
EACH OTHER IN SYRIA. 

124
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,485
WE HAVE TO HAVE OPEN LINES OF 

125
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:09,122
COMMUNICATION. 

126
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,857
WHAT I WOULD ASK IS THAT WE TRY 

127
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,591
TO DE-ESCALATE THE PARTISANSHIP 

128
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,226
IN OUR COUNTRY SO THAT WE CAN, 

129
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,927
ONCE AGAIN, BE OPEN TO SOME 

130
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:16,429
KIND OF DIPLOMACY. 

131
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,630
I HAVE ONE QUESTION WITH REGARD 

132
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,165
TO IRAN AND YOU AND I DIFFER ON 

133
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,332
THE IRANIAN POSSIBILITY OF 

134
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:28,508
FURTHER IRANIAN AGREEMENT. 

135
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,809
I THINK THAT IS ACTUALLY MUCH 

136
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,044
MORE DIFFICULT I HAD MY OWN 

137
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,678
CRITICISMS OF THE NUCLEAR 

138
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:31,978
AGREEMENT. 

139
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,279
I DID NOT THINK IT WAS PERFECT 

140
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,981
AND YET I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO 

141
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,015
HAVE BUILT UPON IT RATHER THAN 

142
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:36,449
DESTROY IT. 

143
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,950
WE HAD A LOT OF MONEY AT THE 

144
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:52,999
TIME AND THAT WAS A CARROT TO 

145
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,233
BRING IRAN TO THE TABLE. 

146
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,501
NOW WE HAVE INSTEAD OF ONE 

147
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,269
ISSUE, INSTEAD OF A SMALLER 

148
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,570
GROUP OF ISSUES, WE HAVE A 

149
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,271
BIGGER GROUP OF ISSUES. 

150
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,472
THE NUCLEAR ISSUES ARE BACK ON 

151
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,707
THE TABLE IF WE HAVE TO 

152
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,507
RENEGOTIATE AND THE BALLISTIC 

153
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,008
MISSILE ISSUE. 

154
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,343
THE POINT THAT I THINK THAT WE 

155
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,544
NEED TO THINK THROUGH IN 

156
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,778
DISCUSSIONS WITH IRAN IS THAT I 

157
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:06,612
THINK THAT IRAN, FROM THEIR 

158
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:07,446
PERSPECTIVE WOULD SEE GETTING 

159
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:08,514
RID OF THEIR BALLISTIC MISSILE 

160
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,415
PROGRAM IS BASICALLY UNILATERAL 

161
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:09,848
OR SURRENDER. 

162
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:10,650
IT IS NOT MY VIEWPOINT. 

163
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,856
IT IS WHAT I BELIEVE IS THERE 

164
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:17,156
VIEWPOINT. 

165
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,190
THEY SEE SAUDI ARABIA AS AN 

166
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,192
ADVERSARY AND ISRAEL AS A 

167
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,493
POTENTIAL ADVERSARY SO I DO NOT 

168
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,793
THINK UNLESS -- IT WOULD BE 

169
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:23,262
GREAT IF YOU GOT ALL THREE TO 

170
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,530
COME TOGETHER AND HAVE A 

171
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,197
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON NOT 

172
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:25,764
DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

173
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:27,200
I DO NOT TO THE OTHER TWO 

174
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,967
COMING TO THE TABLE, FRANKLY, 

175
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:36,242
TO DO THAT. 

176
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,677
I THINK THAT IN MOVING FORWARD, 

177
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,878
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT 

178
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:39,979
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT 

179
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:40,813
GOING TO BE EASY. 

180
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:41,848
THE FIRT IRAN AGREEMENT ALSO 

181
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:42,749
WAS A MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT. 

182
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:43,449
YOU HAD MULTILATERAL SANCTIONS. 

183
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,584
YOU NOW HAVE MORE UNILATERAL 

184
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:44,884
SANCTIONS. 

185
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:45,585
YOU WILL HAVE A UNILATERAL 

186
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,619
AGREEMENT THAT IS YOUR OWN 

187
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:46,919
AGREEMENT. 

188
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,421
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE 

189
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,455
SO OPTIMISTIC BUT I WOULD LIKE 

190
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,091
TO HEAR FROM YOU. 

191
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,526
HOW DO YOU -- WHAT MAKES YOU 

192
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,961
BELIEVE THAT IRAN WILL COME TO 

193
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,761
THE TABLE TO DISCUSS BALLISTIC 

194
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:56,162
MISSILES? 

195
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,363
>> CENTER, I AM UNDER NO 

196
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,697
ILLUSIONS ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT I 

197
00:04:58,697 --> 00:04:59,398
RAN IT VIEWS ITS BALLISTIC 

198
00:04:59,398 --> 00:04:59,932
MISSILE PROGRAM. 

199
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:00,867
I AGREE WITH YOU THERE. 

200
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:20,620
THE QUESTION FOR PRESIDENT 

201
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,854
TRUMP WAS WAS AT THIS GOOD 

202
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:22,087
ENOUGH? 

203
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:23,189
HE CONCLUDED IT WAS NOT 

204
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,656
REMOTELY GOOD ENOUGH. 

205
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,224
HE SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST 

206
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:25,992
DEALS IN HISTORY. 

207
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,226
I DO NOT WANT TO GET THE 

208
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:27,626
LANGUAGE WRONG. 

209
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:28,661
HE CONCLUDED WE WOULD FIND 

210
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,662
OURSELVES IN A BETTER PLACE 

211
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,696
WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT 

212
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:32,065
ALL OF THESE ISSUES, THE BROAD 

213
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,232
SPECTRUM OF ISSUES AND NOT JUST 

214
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,167
THE NUCLEAR PORTFOLIO BUT THE 

215
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,068
MISSILE PROGRAM AND MALIGN 

216
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:35,802
ACTIVITY AROUND THE WORLD. 

217
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,404
ALL OF THEM IN A PACKAGE. 

218
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,471
IT DID ACCEPT THE UNDERSTANDING 

219
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:40,640
THAT THERE WOULD BE THOSE THAT 

220
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,841
WOULD NOT COME ALONGSIDE OF US, 

221
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,875
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT 

222
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,676
THERE'S A COALITION. 

223
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,710
IT IS NOT AMERICA AND AMERICA 

224
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,111
ALONE. 

225
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:45,912
WE HAVE OTHERS THAT BELIEVE 

226
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,146
THAT THIS WAS THE RIGHT 

227
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:47,413
DECISION. 

228
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,047
THE ISRAELIS, SAUDIS, AND 

229
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:48,781
VARIETIES, BAHRAINIS AND OTHER 

230
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,415
SMALLER EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS. 

231
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,383
NOT -- THEY ARE COALESCING 

232
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,417
AROUND UNDERSTANDING HOW WE CAN 

233
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,318
APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO IRAN 

234
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,653
TO TAKE DOWN THE NUCLEAR ARREST 

235
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,854
TO THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS 

236
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,888
THE RISK FROM OTHER MALIGN 

237
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:56,188
ACTIVITIES. 

238
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:56,889

POMPEO, FOR YOUR SERVICE. 

242
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,629
WE HAVE QUITE THE RECORD OF 

243
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,031
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BUSINESS 

244
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:12,104
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. 

245
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:12,939
EXTENSIVE REPORTING AND PUBLIC 

246
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,240
RECORDS SHOW A LARGE AMOUNT OF 

247
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,374
MONEY FROM FORMER SOVIET STATES 

248
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,043
AND RUSSIA IN THE DONALD TRUMP 

249
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,947
PROJECTS. 

250
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:21,681
TRUMP INTERNATIONAL TOWER AND 

251

HOTEL IN PANAMA. 

253
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:29,789
THE TRUMP PROJECT IN SOHO AND 

254
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,491
NEW YORK CITY ARE A FEW OF THE 

255
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:31,824
BIG EXAMPLES. 

256
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:32,625
HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. 

257
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,559
A RUSSIAN OLIGARCH BOUGHT A 

258
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,727
PROPERTY FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP 

259
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:45,037

261
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,073
BEFORE, FOR $95 MILLION IN 

262
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,273
2008. 

263
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,242
THAT WAS LESS THAN FOUR YEARS 

264
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:58,050
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP PAID $41 

265
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,051
MILLION, SO MORE THAN DOUBLING 

266
00:06:59,051 --> 00:06:59,552
HIS MONEY. 

267
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,486

END QUOTE. 

274
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:08,394
DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO BUILD A 

275
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,896
TRUMP TOWER IN MOSCOW FOR 30 

276
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:10,129
YEARS. 

277
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,631
HE EVEN TWEETED IN 2013, TRUMP 

278
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:16,536
TOWER MOSCOW IS NEXT. 

279
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,169
THAT IS IN QUOTES. 

280
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,237
IN 2015, ANSWERING A QUESTION 

281
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:18,971

MADE CLEAR HIS DESIRES WITH 

285
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,386
RUSSIA, STATING I WOULD GET 

286
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,186
ALONG WELL WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN 

287
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:35,821
AND I DO NOT THINK THAT WE NEED 

288
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:36,322
THE SANCTIONS. 

289
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,256

PUTIN.

HE SEEMS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT

00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,364
HELSINKI AND WHAT HAPPENED 

297
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,832
THERE THAN THE SENATE FOREIGN

RELATIONS COMMITTEE. 

299
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,885
AS WE SAW IN HELSINKI AND 

300
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:06,519
THROUGHOUT HIS PRESIDENCY IN 

301
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,520
THE CAMPAIGN, THIS PRESIDENT IS

<font color="#0000FF"><u>XTREMELY SYMPATHETIC TO THE </u></font>

303
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,288
VERY RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT THAT

00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:09,956
ATTACKED AND CONTINUES TO 

305
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:10,957
ATTACK OUR DEMOCRACY AND THOSE 

306
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:11,624
OF OUR ALLIES. 

307
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,192
IT IS A FACT OF POLITICAL LIFE 

308
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:13,993
TODAY THAT MANY AMERICANS ARE 

309
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,727
CONCERNED ABOUT THE 

310
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:15,561
UNTHINKABLE, THAT A U.S. 

311
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,228
PRESIDENT COULD HAVE A 

312
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:17,330
COMPROMISED -- A COMPROMISING

RELATIONSHIP WITH A FOREIGN 

314
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:18,497
POWER. 

315
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:19,798
PRESIDENT CAN CLEAR THIS ALL UP 

316
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:20,332
IN THREE SIMPLE WAYS. 

317
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:21,334
RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS AND 

318
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:28,207
THOSE OF THE DONALD TRUMP 

319
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,408
ORGANIZATION AND THE TAXES FROM 

320
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,309
THE VARIOUS FAMILY BUSINESSES, 

321
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,544
SOME OF WHICH WE DO NOT EVEN 

322
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,078
KNOW ABOUT. 

323
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:32,912
AFTER HELSINKI, DO YOU THINK 

324
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:33,712
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

325
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,114
DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT IS IN 

326
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:35,748
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS 

327
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,416
AND BUSINESS INTERESTS THAT ARE 

328
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:44,056
INTERTWINED WITH RUSSIA? 

329
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,691
>> SENATOR, I'M GOING TO TRY TO 

330
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,726
STAY OUT OF THE SAME POLITICAL 

331
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,327
CIRCUS THAT YOU AND I ENDED UP 

332
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,562
IN LAST TIME THAT I WAS SITTING 

333
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:49,762

SIMPLY RESPONDING BY SAYING, 

335
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,698
THIS IS SAME PRESIDENT WITH 

336
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,866
WHICH YOU SEEM TO EXPRESS SUCH 

337
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,670
A DEEP CONCERN IS ENGAGED IN A 

338
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,704
MASSIVE DEFENSE BUILDUP WHICH 

339
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,941
THREATENED VLADIMIR PUTIN'S

REGIME.  

341
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:03,375
HE INSTRUCTED US TO PUT

TOGETHER A NUCLEAR POSTURE 

343
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:21,327
REVIEW THAT HAS SET VLADIMIR 

344
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,828
PUTIN ON HIS EAR BECAUSE OF THE 

345
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:23,362
ROBUSTNESS AND THE

00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,062
RECAPITALIZATION OF THE NUCLEAR

QUESTION. 

355
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:32,305
LET ME TRY IT A LITTLE 

356
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:32,672
DIFFERENT WAY. 

357
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,906

INTERESTS OLIGARCHS AND OTHERS  

364
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,296
ARE PART OF THE DECISION-MAKING

UNDERSTAND WHAT WENT ON? 

369
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:01,801

380
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:10,809
DIFFERENTLY.

I THINK IT WAS IN APRIL. 

518
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:47,726

00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,247
THAT WE ARE GOING IN A PATH 

526
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,481

SINGAPORE SUMMIT WITH PRESIDENT 

555
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,025
TRUMP AND THE CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-

556
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:53,259
UN? 

557
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:53,759
>> IT WAS. 

558
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,995
>> IT WAS BROUGHT UP THAT THOSE 

559
00:14:55,995 --> 00:15:06,205
ARE THE -- WHY WAS IT NOT IN 

560
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:06,638
THE COMMUNICATION? 

561
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:07,272
FOLLOWING THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT? 

562
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:08,574
MECH I WOULD RATHER NOT TALK 

563
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,575
ABOUT THE COURSE OF THE 

564
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,409
NEGOTIATIONS AND HOW WE ARRIVED 

565
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,944
AT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE DID. 

566
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:12,945
>>> IS NORTH KOREA STILL MAKING 

567
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:13,478
ADVANCEMENTS UNDERTAKING 

568
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:14,179
NUCLEAR PROGRAM? 

569
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,015
>> MAY I ANSWER THAT QUESTION 

570
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:27,993
IN A DIFFERENT SETTING? 

571
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,094
>> YOU CANNOT ANSWER THAT 

572
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:29,494
QUESTION HERE? 

573
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:29,794
MECH YEAH. 

574
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:30,729
I WOULD PREFER NOT TO. 

575
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,031
>> WE WOULD LOVE TO PROVIDE 

576
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,265
THAT SETTING FOR YOU SOON HAPPY 

577
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,633
TO DO IT IF WE NEED TO. 

578
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,667
I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT. 

579
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,069
SENATOR, I AM NOT TRYING TO BE 

580
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:37,436
CUTE. 

581
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,437
WE ARE ENGAGED IN A COMPLEX 

582
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,905
NEGOTIATION WITH A DIFFICULT 

583
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:53,452
ADVERSARY, AND EACH OF THE 

584
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,486
ACTIVITIES THAT WE UNDERTAKE IS 

585
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,687
NOT GOING TO BE FULLY APPARENT 

586
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:57,322
TO THE WORLD AT THE MOMENT THAT 

587
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:57,689
IS UNDERTAKEN. 

588
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:58,657
THERE WILL BE PROCESSES AND 

589
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,625
DISCUSSIONS THAT WILL BE HAD 

590
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,960
THAT IMPORTANT THAT THEY NOT BE 

591
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,460
REAL-TIME DISCLOSED. 

592
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,594
AS I ANSWER ONE QUESTION AND 

593
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,429
THEN CHOOSE NOT TO ANSWER 

594
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,330
ANOTHER, IT BECOMES PATENTLY 

595
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,464
OBVIOUS WHY I CHOSE NOT TO 

596
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,665
ANSWER ONE OR THE OTHER. 

597
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,900
THEREFORE, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT 

598
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,934
A BLANKET BAN ON GOING DOWN 

599
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,569
THAT PATH  IS THE ONLY WAY TO 

600
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:11,537
ENSURE THAT I HAVE THE 

601
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,571
OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATE THIS 

602
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,972
THING IN A WAY THAT IS NOT 

603
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,007
BEING DONE IN THE WASHINGTON 

604
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:15,808
POST AND NEW YORK TIMES. 

605
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,809
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT. 

606
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,278
I THINK IT IS A VERY PORT -- 

607
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:19,979
IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT WE 

608
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,113
GET TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT, 

609
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:21,914
NORTH KOREA IS OVERTLY, 

610
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:22,815
COVERTLY, HOWEVER THEY ARE 

611
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,716
DOING IT, MAKING ADVANCEMENTS 

612
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,553
IN THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM OR STILL 

613
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,922
CONTINUING  THE MEASURE OF 

614
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:30,722
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. 

615
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:31,457
I FORGET IT'S IMPORTANT. 

616
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,658
>> I ANSWERED A QUESTION THAT 

617
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,091
TOUCHES ON THAT. 

618
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:34,293
I ANSWER THE QUESTION FROM 

619
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,027
SENATOR MARQUIS ABOUT WHETHER 

620
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,328
THEY ARE CONTINUING  TO CREATE 

621
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,329
MATERIAL AND I ANSWERED THAT, 

622
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,197
INDEED, THEY ARE. 

623
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:46,405
>> THE GOAL ORIGINALLY, I THINK 

624
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:46,972
WAS COMPLETE VERIFIABLE 

625
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:47,572
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION 

626
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:48,607
BY THE END OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

627
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,008
FIRST TERM. 

628
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,776
DOES THAT REMAIN THE GOAL? 

629
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:59,584
>> YES. 

630
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:00,118
>> MORE QUICKLY POSSIBLE. 

631
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:01,520
>> WHEN WILL WE KNOW IF NORTH 

632
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,321
KOREA IS MOVING TOWARDS 

633
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:02,721
DENUCLEARIZATION? 

634
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,322
CONCRETE, VERIFIABLE STEPS? 

635
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,756
>> I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO 

636
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:05,057
THAT. 

637
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,592
I COULD NOT TELL YOU WHAT DAY 

638
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,459
AND I'M GUESSING THAT THIS 

639
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,527
GROUP WOULD DISAGREE ABOUT WHEN 

640
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,228
THAT MOMENT TOOK PLACE. 

641
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,462
THAT IS A PROCESS FOR SURE. 

642
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,864
SOME WILL FIND THAT THE FIRST 

643
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,865
STEP ALONG THE WAY 

644
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,699
DEMONSTRATION OF I THINK YOU 

645
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,433
SAID SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS BUT 

646
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,634
OTHERS MAY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL 

647
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,902
WE ARE ALMOST DONE TO DECLARE 

648
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:17,603
SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS BUT I 

649
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,270
CANNOT ANSWER THAT. 

650
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:32,317
IT IS DEFINITELY A PROCESS. 

651
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,218
WE WILL DEFINITELY TAKE TIME. 

652
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,620
>>> WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON 

653
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,053
STRATEGIC PATIENTS. 

654
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:35,954
THE STATEMENT THAT YOU USED 

655
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:36,487
USES PATIENT DIPLOMACY. 

656
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:37,489
AS THE U.S. DOCTRINE TOWARDS 

657
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,490
NORTH KOREA STILL ONE OF 

658
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:38,991
MAXIMUM PRESSURE? 

659
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:39,591
>> IT IS. 

660
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,726
I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE 

661
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,727
DIFFERENCE IS A LITTLE BIT 

662
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,162
SUBTLE AND PERHAPS I DO NOT 

663
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:43,962
WANT TO OVERSTATE THE 

664
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:44,997
DIFFERENCE IN THE LANGUAGE BUT 

665
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:45,797
HERE IS WHAT IS DEFENSE. 

666
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:46,632
STRATEGIC OPERATIONS IN OUR 

667
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,465
JUDGMENT WAS HOPING THAT 

668
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:48,233
SOMETHING WORKED RIGHT. 

669
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,600
HERE WE HAVE A STRATEGIC 

670
00:17:49,600 --> 00:18:02,447
OBJECTIVE. 

671
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:03,682
BACKED UP WITH A DIPLOMATIC AND 

672
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,583
ECONOMIC PRESSURE WHICH WE 

673
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,717
BELIEVE GIVES US A PATHWAY TO 

674
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:06,718
ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE AND ALSO 

675
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:07,920
AN OFF-RAMP IN THE EVENT THAT 

676
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,254
WE CONCLUDE THAT IT DOES NOT 

677
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,255
WORK TO GO ANOTHER DIRECTION, 

678
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,289
TO ACHIEVE THE DEMILITARIZATION 

679
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:11,656
OF NORTH KOREA. 

680
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:12,624

SANCTIONS POLICY ENHANCEMENT 

682
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:14,026
ACT WHICH REQUIRES THE 

683
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:14,959
PRESIDENT TO INITIATE 

684
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:15,560
INVESTIGATIONS INTO POSSIBLE

INTO THE PERSONS UPON EVIDENCE

PROLIFERATING ACTIVITIES SO 

689
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,130
THAT WE CAN APPLY ADDITIONAL 

690
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:19,430
SANCTIONS. 

691
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,332
COMMON INVESTIGATIONS INTO NEW 

692
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,266
DESIGNATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE 

693
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:21,566
RIGHT NOW? 

694
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:37,382
>> I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUT

QUESTION IN ANOTHER WAY AND SEE 

697
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:40,552
IF THIS MEETS IT. 

698
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,653
THIS IS THE CASE THAT THE 

699
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:42,521
MINISTRATION IS CONTINUING TO 

700
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,555

ARE ADDITIONAL NORTH KOREAN AND

CHINESE ENTITIES THAT COULD BE

IDENTIFIED FOR ADDITIONAL

SANCTIONS. 

718
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:02,674
IS THAT CORRECT? 

719
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,175
>> YES. 

720
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,409

WAY THAT WE THINK INCREASES THE

LIKELIHOOD THAT KIM JONG-UN 

726
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:09,881
FULFILLS THE COMMITMENT. 

727
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,116
>>> WHY HAVE WE NOT SEEN 

728
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:11,616
DESIGNATIONS RECENTLY? 

729
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:12,551
>> I CANNOT ANSWER THAT 

730
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:12,818
QUESTION. 

731
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,952
>> I WOULD LIKE TO GET AN

00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,653
ANSWER FOR THAT IF WE COULD. 

733
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:17,822
HAS SOUTH KOREA MADE ADDITIONAL 

734
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:20,459
REQUESTS TO THE UNITED STATES 

735
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,359
FOR SANCTIONS RELIEF? 

736
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:30,636
>> AS IT RELATES TO ADDITIONAL 

737
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,270
ACTIVITIES WITH NORTH KOREA. 

738
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,638

THAT SOUTH KOREA HAS MADE OUR 

740
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,474
PUBLIC, AND THEY HAVE OCCURRED 

741
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,008
THROUGH THE COMMITTEE UP AT THE 

742
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:37,643
UNITED NATIONS. 

743
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,977
SO I THINK THAT THE LIST OF 

744
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:39,610
THINGS THAT THE SOUTH KOREANS 

745
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,681
ARE REQUESTING IN TERMS OF 

746
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,915
EITHER MAKING SURE THAT THE 

747
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:45,183
ACTIVITY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 

748
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:51,823
SANCTIONS REGIME. THERE ARE 

749
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:52,356
HUMANITARIAN EXCEPTIONS. 

750
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:53,358
>> IS THE U.S. CONSIDERING OR 

751
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:53,959
GRANTING THOSE? 

752
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,527
>> WE ARE REVIEWING THE 

753
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:55,794
REQUEST. 

754
00:19:55,794 --> 00:20:01,733
WE APPROVED ONE. 

755
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,434
>> SOUTH KOREA. 

756
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:02,934
>>> I'M SORRY. 

757
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:03,335
SOUTH KOREA. 

758
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:03,535
YES. 

759
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,137
WE HAD ONE THAT HAD TO DEAL 

760
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,238
WITH A MILITARY TO MILITARY 

761
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,206
COMMUNICATION CHANNEL AND THE 

762
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,072
OTHERS ARE UNDER REVIEW. 

763
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:17,416
>> IF WE COULD GET AN 

764
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,250
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT SOME OF 

765
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,251
THOSE MEASURES ARE, THAT WOULD 

766
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:19,618
BE GREAT. 

767
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,153
YOU GAVE A VERY GOOD SPEECH ON 

768
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,187
JULY 22, ON THE IRAN POLICY, 

769
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,488
THE REAGAN LIBRARY, AS YOU 

770
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:23,788
MENTIONED. 

771
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:24,656
IF YOU WERE TO SUBSTITUTE THE 

772
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,958
WORD OUT, I RAN OUT AND 

773
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:26,958
SUBSTITUTE NORTH KOREA, WITH 

774
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:27,592
THE SPEECH ACCURATELY DESCRIBE 

775
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:28,694
THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN NORTH 

776
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:28,994
KOREA? 

777
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,628
>> THAT WAS A LONG SPEECH, 

778
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:33,165
SENATOR. 

779
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:33,799
>> BASICALLY THEY -- 

780
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,334
>> I THINK THAT IN LARGE PART, 

781
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,234
IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT.  

782
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:39,271
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. 

783
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,839
IN TERMS OF THEIR OPERATIONAL 

784
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,707
CAPACITY FOR THE NUCLEAR 

785
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:49,981
PROGRAM. 

786
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:50,849
BUT THE NATURE OF THE TWO 

787
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:51,316
REGIMES IS SIMILAR. 

788
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,784
>>> I AM OUT OF TIME, MR. 

789
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:53,050
CHAIRMAN. 

790
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,585
THANK YOU. 

791
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,720
>>> BEFORE TURNING IT OVER, I 

792
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,121
WILL USE A LITTLE BIT OF MY 

793
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:56,321
TIME. 

794
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,055
YOU OBVIOUSLY ACQUIT YOURSELF 

795
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:57,355
VERY WELL. 

796
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:03,228
THOSE OF US THAT KNOW YOU AND 

797
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,463
WORK WITH YOU HAVE MOSTLY -- 

798
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,064
MANY OF US, INCLUDING ME, AND I 

799
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,567
WILL SAY MOST OF US, ACTUALLY --

800
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,135
WE HAVE TREMENDOUS FAITH IN 

801
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:18,777
YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE THINGS 

802
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,978
HAPPEN, AND WE THANK YOU FOR 

803
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,313
ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU ARE 

804
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,314
TAKING ON, BUILDING A GREAT 

805
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,148
CULTURE IN THE STATE 

806
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,182
DEPARTMENT, BRING ON PEOPLE 

807
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:24,782
THAT ARE TRULY EXEMPLARY. 

808
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:26,618
WE FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT 

809
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,855
SECRETARY MATTIS. 

810
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,056
THE WAY THAT HE CONDUCTS 

811
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,290
HIMSELF AND WHAT HE DOES BUT I 

812
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,592
THINK THAT THERE IS TREMENDOUS 

813
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,526
FAITH ON BOTH SIDES OF THE 

814
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,527
AISLE AND HIS ABILITIES AND 

815
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:43,902
WHAT HE DOES. 

816
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:44,970
MUCH OF WHAT YOU ARE HEARING 

817
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,904
TODAY HAS NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO 

818
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:46,705
DO WITH YOU. 

819
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,040
I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE 

820
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,241
POLICIES THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN 

821
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,375
PLACE AND IN MANY CASES, ARE 

822
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,376
STRONGER THAN THEY HAVE EVER 

823
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,277
BEEN PUT IN PLACE. 

824
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,211
I AGREE WITH YOU. 

825
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,212
IT IS THE PRESIDENT THAT CAUSES 

826
00:21:54,212 --> 00:22:00,719
PEOPLE TO HAVE CONCERNS. 

827
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,154
AND I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOME 

828
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,455
INSIGHTS INTO YOU AS TO -- FOR 

829
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,189
INSTANCE, AT THE HELSINKI 

830
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,123
CONFERENCE, THE EQUIVALENCE 

831
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:05,790
BETWEEN OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 

832
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,892
AND WHAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS 

833
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:07,459
SAYING, THAT SHOCKS PEOPLE. 

834
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:13,131
YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU SAW DAN 

835
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:13,932
COATS RESPONDED AFTERWARDS AND 

836
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,167
TODAY, THIS WAS RELATED TO WHAT 

837
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,538
HE SAID AT HELSINKI. 

838
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,405
THE NOTION OF EVEN THINKING 

839
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,139
ABOUT EXCHANGING DIPLOMATS? 

840
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,473
SENDING DIPLOMATS OVER TO THE 

841
00:22:22,473 --> 00:22:32,217
INTENT -- TO BE INTERROGATED BY 

842
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:32,617
VLADIMIR PUTIN? 

843
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,919
TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND TO LET 

844
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,253
THAT BE SET OUT OF THE WHITE 

845
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,254
HOUSE AS AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT? 

846
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,489
THIS IS MY OPINION AND I 

847
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,490
BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT, TO 

848
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,324
PURPOSELY CAUSE THE AMERICAN 

849
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,892
PEOPLE TO MISUNDERSTAND ABOUT 

850
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,561
THE NATO CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO 

851
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,995
CAUSE THEM TO DOUBT NATO AND TO 

852
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,497
REALLY DRIVE PUBLIC OPINION 

853
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,432
AGAINST THE NATO -- THAT, TO 

854
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,034
ME, WAS PURPOSEFUL, NOT UNLIKE 

855
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,735
WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER 

856
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:51,135
CHARLOTTESVILLE. 

857
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:53,772
AND THEN ARTICLE 5. TO GO ON 

858
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,174
TELEVISION AND SAY, WELL, WHY 

859
00:22:56,174 --> 00:23:08,453
WOULD WE HONOR THEY -- I AM 

860
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,654
PARAPHRASING, BUT WHY WOULD WE 

861
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:10,589
HONOR ARTICLE 5 AND MONTENEGRO? 

862
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,823
WE PASSED A LAW TO SEND THEM 

863
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:12,524
INTO NATO.  

864
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:13,024
HE SIGNED IT. 

865
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:17,195
IT WOULD BE A DERELICTION IF HE 

866
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,397
CAUSED IT TO BE THE CASE. 

867
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,598
WHY DOES HE DO THE CASE. 

868
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:30,308
IS THERE SOME STRATEGY ON BOTH 

869
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,476
SIDES OF THE AISLE? 

870
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:32,143
DOUBT IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS 

871
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:33,144
TO WHAT HIS MOTIVATIONS ARE, 

872
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:34,145
WHEN, IN FACT, WE HAVE 

873
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:34,980
TREMENDOUS FAITH IN YOU. 

874
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,115
TREMENDOUS FAITH IN MATTIS. 

875
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:47,225
BUT IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S 

876
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,260
ACTIONS THAT CREATE CEMENT -- 

877
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,060
TREMENDOUS DISTRUST IN OUR 

878
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,794
NATION, AMONG OUR ALLIES. 

879
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:50,395
IT IS PALPABLE. 

880
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:51,663
WE MEET AND TALK WITH THEM. 

881
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,831
IS THERE A STRATEGY TO THIS? 

882
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,065
WHAT IS IT THAT CAUSES THE 

883
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,300
PRESIDENT TO PURPOSELY CREATE 

884
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,134
DISTRUST IN THESE INSTITUTIONS? 

885
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,337
WHAT WE ARE DOING. 

886
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,273
>> SENATOR, I DISAGREE WITH 

887
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,407
MOST OF WHAT YOU SAID. 

888
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,477
YOU SOMEHOW DISCONNECT THE 

889
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,480
ADMINISTRATIONS ACTIVITIES FROM 

890
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,514
THE ACTIONS. 

891
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:15,387
THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME. 

892
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,821
EVERY SANCTION THAT WAS PUT IN 

893
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:17,956
PLACE WAS SIGNED OFF BY THE 

894
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,356
PRESIDENT OF 

895
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,959
THE UNITED STATES, EVERY SPY 

896
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,092
REMOVED.

897
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:41,346
>> HE'S HAPPY TO MAKE CHANGES 

898
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,046
AND CHANGED THE COURSE. 

899
00:24:42,046 --> 00:24:49,854
YOU WILL BE THERE AND HE WILL 

900
00:24:49,854 --> 00:24:52,223
BE THEIR TOUGHEST ENEMY. I 

901
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:56,294
THINK I CAN PROVE THAT IS THE 

902
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,028
CASE. 

903
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,163
I THINK I HAVE. 

904
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,031
SOMEHOW THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT 

905
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:00,831
THE ADMINISTRATION IS FREELY 

906
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:01,132
FLOATING. 

907
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,500
IT'S PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 

908
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,701
ADMINISTRATION AND MAKE NO 

909
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,436
MISTAKE WHO IS FULLY IN CHARGE 

910
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:06,271
OF THIS AND DIRECTING EACH 

911
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:06,871
ACIVITY THAT CAUSED RUSSIAN 

912
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:07,672
PRESIDENT VLADAMIR PUTIN TO BE 

913
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:12,076
IN A VERY DIFFICULT PLACE, 

914
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:12,477
TODAY. 

915
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:15,647
>> YOU'VE HANDLED OURSELVES THE 

916
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,548
WAY YOU SHOULD, IN MY OPINION, 

917
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:19,450
AS IT RELATES TO COMMENTS. 

918
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,020
I NOTICED THAT YOU ARE NOT 

919
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,422
RESPONDING TO WHAT I'M SAYING. 

920
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,858
>> I THINK I RESPONDED TO 

921
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,325
EVERYTHING, SENATOR. 

922
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:27,792
>> YOU DIDN'T. 

923
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:28,860
YOU JUST DIDN'T, OKAY? 

924
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,229
>> WE DISAGREE. 

925
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:37,301
>> IT'S IN THE TRANSCRIPT IF 

926
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:38,636
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. 

927
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:39,638
>> WE WILL LET THE WORLD 

928
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:39,871
DECIDE. 

929
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,805
>> IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S PUBLIC 

930
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:41,439
STATEMENTS THAT CREATE CONCERN 

931
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,907
AMONG SENATORS ON BOTH SIDES OF 

932
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:46,511
THE AISLE. 

933
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,579
I WAS ASKING YOU IF, IN FACT, 

934
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:51,282
THERE WAS SOME RHYME OR REASON 

935
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:54,252
THAT THIS TYPE OF DISCORD WOULD 

936
00:25:54,252 --> 00:26:02,027
BE CREATED. I KNOW YOU ARE NOT 

937
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,028
GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. 

938
00:26:04,028 --> 00:26:05,863
I'M TRYING TO MAKE A POINT. 

939
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:07,464
>> I KNOW YOU ARE. 

940
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:10,168
>> WHY THE OPEN COMMENTS ON THE 

941
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,569
QUESTIONS AND THE ENERGY BEHIND 

942
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,871
HIS HEARING, IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU 

943
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,271
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT GENERAL 

944
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:16,574
MATTERS AND WHAT WE ARE DOING 

945
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,842
ON THE GROUND. 

946
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:18,977
>> SENATOR, YOU WENT THROUGH A 

947
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:19,978
LITANY OF STATEMENTS BUT, FIRST 

948
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:24,282
OF ALL, I WILL TELL YOU THAT 

949
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,483
I'VE TALKED TO THE SAME ALLIES 

950
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:26,484
YOU DO AND I'VE SPOKEN TO THE 

951
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:26,917
FOREIGN MINISTERS. 

952
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:28,086
IT IS THE CASE THEY ARE 

953
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,553
BEHAVING DIFFERENTLY. 

954
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:34,425
THEY ARE NOW SCRAMBLING TO 

955
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:36,962
FIGURE OUT HOW THEY ARE FULLY 

956
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,129
PART OF NATO AND SOME OF THAT 

957
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,063
IS A RESULT OF THE STATEMENTS 

958
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:41,099
YOU'VE REFERRED TO, SENATOR. 

959
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,634
SOME OF THAT IS IDENTIFYING THE 

960
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:47,472
NORTH --

961
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,073
>> I'VE SAID THAT. 

962
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:49,607
>> THERE YOU GO. 

963
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:54,045
I WILL LET THE RECORD REFLECT 

964
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:55,547
IT. 

965
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,349
>> SOME OF THESE STATEMENTS 

966
00:26:58,349 --> 00:26:58,949
ACTUALLY ACHIEVED IMPORTANT 

967
00:26:58,949 --> 00:26:59,651
POLICY OUTCOMES FOR THE U.S. 

968
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,919
>> SOME OF THEM WERE VERY 

969
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:01,820
DAMAGING. 

970
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:09,594
>> THANK YOU MR. SECRETARY. 

971
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,796
IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR 

972
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,598
BARRASSO'S QUESTION ON NEW 

973
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,666
START, I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP. 

974
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:16,868
THE U.S. AND RUSSIA CAME INTO 

975
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:17,602
COMPLIANCE IN FEBRUARY 2018 AND 

976
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:18,803
MET THE DEADLINE ON DEPLOYED 

977
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,974
NUCLEAR WARHEADS. 

978
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:23,574
MY IMPRESSION, FROM YOUR 

979
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:24,476
DIALOGUE, WAS THE U.S. DOES NOT 

980
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:29,647
YET HAVE A POSITION ON WEATHER 

981
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,349
TO WORK TO EXTEND THE NEW START 

982
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:31,849
AGREEMENT PAST 2021. 

983
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:38,322
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 

984
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:39,924
WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN 

985
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:40,257
ACHIEVE THIS. 

986
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:46,598
WE VIEW THESE AS INDIVIDUAL 

987
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,199
AGREEMENTS, AS A LEGAL MATTER 

988
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,267
AND THEY CAN BE WORKED ON 

989
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:49,967
INDEPENDENTLY BUT THE DETERRENT 

990
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:50,802
MODEL, THE UNDERPINNING IN THE 

991
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:56,241
FRAMEWORK OF THESE AGREEMENTS 

992
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,743
THAT ARE CONNECTED, WHETHER IT 

993
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,945
BE COVERED BY NEW START OR THE 

994
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,847
INF TREATY OR OTHER PRECISION 

995
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,582
-- PROVISIONS, IT IS THE CASE 

996
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,651
THAT AS WE EVALUATE THIS 

997
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,087
APPROACH, WE TRY TO DO IT IN A 

998
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:09,487
HOLISTIC WAY. 

999
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,422
>> I CAN ANTICIPATE THAT THIS 

1000
00:28:11,422 --> 00:28:13,458
IS SOMETHING YOU AND YOUR TEAM 

1001
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,226
WILL BE WORKING ON IN THE YEAR 

1002
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:15,893
AHEAD, SETTING THE GROUNDWORK 

1003
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:16,827
FOR THE OPTIONS. 

1004
00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:18,796
THANK YOU. 

1005
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:19,564
RUSSIAN OIL TANKERS REPORTEDLY 

1006
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,766
SUPPLIED FUEL TO NORTH KOREA 

1007
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:25,770
SEVERAL TIMES IN 2017. 

1008
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,805
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP MADE A 

1009
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,039
REFERENCE IN WHICH HE TALKED 

1010
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:37,315
ABOUT SAYING THAT WHAT CHINA IS 

1011
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,651
HELPING US WITH, RUSSIA IS 

1012
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,118
DENTING AND HE SAID, 

1013
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:40,852
SPECIFICALLY, RUSSIA IS NOT 

1014
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,186
HELPING US AT ALL WITH NORTH 

1015
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:43,488
KOREA. 

1016
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:46,658
DID THIS ISSUE OF RUSSIA 

1017
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:52,096
BYPASSING THE U.N. SANCTIONS 

1018
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,963
COME UP IN THE CONVERSATION 

1019
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:53,530
BETWEEN RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 

1020
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,465
VLADAMIR PUTIN AND PRESIDENT 

1021
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:58,670
DONALD TRUMP? 

1022
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,071
>> I THINK I CAN ANSWER THAT. 

1023
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:00,638
I BELIEVE PRESIDENT DONALD 

1024
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:01,673
TRUMP HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS. 

1025
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,508
IN FACT, RUSSIA'S COMMITMENT TO 

1026
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:07,445
HELP US ACHIEVE 

1027
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,246
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA 

1028
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,413
DID COME UP IN THEY DISCUSSED 

1029
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:16,855
THIS. 

1030
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,690
CONTINUING TO ENFORCE THE 

1031
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,824
SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS, 

1032
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,826
RESOLUTIONS THE RUSSIANS VOTED 

1033
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:22,961
FOR, WERE RAISED BETWEEN THE 

1034
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:23,561
TWO OF THEM. 

1035
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,428
I HEARD IN A SUBSEQUENT MEETING 

1036
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:24,929
WHERE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 

1037
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,729
VLADAMIR PUTIN REITERATED 

1038
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:26,397
COMMITMENT TO DOING EACH OF 

1039
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:30,268
THOSE TWO THINGS. 

1040
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,335
>> TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR 

1041
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:32,303
CONVERSATION WITH TIM CAIN 

1042
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,038
ABOUT THE COMMUNIQUCFROM THE 

1043
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:41,045
SINGAPORE SUMMIT AND THE 

1044
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,548
DETAILS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED 

1045
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,116
OUT IN REGARD TO HAVING A 

1046
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,151
SURVEY, TO THE STARTING POINT 

1047
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:46,718
OF THE DETAILED NUCLEAR 

1048
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:51,456
AGREEMENT, WHEN YOU HAVE AN 

1049
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,891
AGREEMENT REGARDING THE DETAILS 

1050
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,959
OF HOW SUCH A SURVEY OF NORTH 

1051
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:55,627
KOREAN MISSILES AND MATERIALS 

1052
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,594
AND SO FORTH, WHEN YOU HAVE 

1053
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:57,462
THAT AGREEMENT, WILL YOU BRIEF 

1054
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:03,268
THIS COMMITTEE ON THAT? 

1055
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,136
>> SIR, I'M SURE WE WILL BE 

1056
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:05,970
ABLE TO SHARE SOME ELEMENTS OF 

1057
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,470
THAT WITH YOU. 

1058
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:12,977
I'M HARKENING BACK TO THE 

1059
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:13,578
AGREEMENT IN WHICH THEY 

1060
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,846
PROVIDED A DECLARATION THAT WAS 

1061
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:22,654
KNOWINGLY FALSE AND THAT IS, THE

1062
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,022
ADMINISTRATION KNEW IT DID NOT 

1063
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,790
REFLECT ACCURATELY, THE HISTORY 

1064
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,958
OF THE IRANIAN WEAPONS PROGRAM. 

1065
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,327
I PROMISE YOU I WON'T DO THAT. 

1066
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,995
I PROMISE I WON'T LIE ABOUT THE 

1067
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,529
CONTENTS OF THE DECLARATION IT. 

1068
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:35,500
IF WE DISAGREE OR THINK THEY ARE

1069
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,935
WRONG, WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 

1070
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,269
BUT I WILL HAVE TO THINK 

1071
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,338
THROUGH PRECISELY HOW, AND IN 

1072
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,940
THE APPROPRIATE WAY, WE WOULD 

1073
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,974
SHARE THAT INFORMATION. 

1074
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,376
YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT NOT TO 

1075
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,644
ALLOW A FALSE DECLARATION TO 

1076
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,212
FORM A FUNDAMENTAL PILLAR OF A 

1077
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:50,715
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT AND THE WAY 

1078
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:51,316
IT DID. 

1079
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,519
>> WE ALL HAD PRIVY NOT JUST TO 

1080
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,153
THE BRIEFING, BUT THE ACTUAL 

1081
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:57,221
DOCUMENT AND DETAILS AND WE 

1082
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:58,622
HAVE THAT STANDARD. 

1083
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:00,792
IN FACT, THOSE WERE MADE 

1084
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:01,725
PUBLIC, AS WELL. 

1085
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:03,795
WOULD YOU EXPECT TO MEET THOSE 

1086
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,595
TWO STANDARDS, EVENTUALLY? 

1087
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:08,165
>> WHEN THE AGREEMENT IS 

1088
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:08,532
COMPLETE, YES. 

1089
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:09,099
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING 

1090
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:09,968
ABOUT DRAWING UP THE PROCESS. 

1091
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,704
I BELIEVE THE DOCUMENTS WERE 

1092
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,038
MADE PUBLIC WHEN THE AGREEMENT 

1093
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:14,338
WAS FINAL. 

1094
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:15,473
WE HOPE TO BRING THE AGREEMENT 

1095
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:16,975
TO CONGRESS AND OF COURSE, IT 

1096
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,142
IS THE CASE THAT YOU WOULD NEED 

1097
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:18,976
TO SEE THE UNDERPINNINGS OF 

1098
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:23,548
THAT AGREEMENT AND PART OF IT 

1099
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,382
WOULD BE THE SERIES OF 

1100
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:27,452
DECLARATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH 

1101
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:27,618
IT. 

1102
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:29,554
>> I TELL YOU, IT DID BOTHER ME 

1103
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,355
BECAUSE THOSE DETAILS HADN'T 

1104
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,289
BEEN WORKED OUT YET AND THE 

1105
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,357
PRESIDENT HAD CONCEDED TO 

1106
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:36,461
SETTING ASIDE THE JOINT 

1107
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,061
EXERCISES WITH SOUTH KOREA. 

1108
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:37,961
ONE OF THE SOUTH KOREAN LEADERS 

1109
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:39,097
BRIEFED IN ADVANCE OF THAT 

1110
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:44,702
ANNOUNCEMENT WAS -- >> I WILL 

1111
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:47,839
LEAVE THAT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF 

1112
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,106
DEFENSE. 

1113
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,808
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN MILITARY 

1114
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,542
CHANNELS. 

1115
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,109
>> PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

1116
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:52,776
BLAMED POOR RELATIONS WITH 

1117
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:53,811
RUSSIA ON U.S. FOOLISHNESS AND 

1118
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:54,411
I'M SURPRISED HE BLAMED U.S. 

1119
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:55,580
FOOLISHNESS RATHER THAN RUSSIA 

1120
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:03,354
ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA AND THE 

1121
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,422
OCCUPATION OF EASTERN UKRAINE 

1122
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,390
AND THEIR ATTACKS ON 

1123
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,991
INDIVIDUALS IN BRITAIN AND THE 

1124
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,659
SUPPORT OF THE SYRIAN 

1125
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:10,995
GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY WERE USING 

1126
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,131
BARREL BOMBS AND GAS ON THEIR 

1127
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:13,464
OWN PEOPLE. 

1128
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:14,298
AND, GIVEN THAT RUSSIA'S 

1129
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:14,998
SIGNIFICANT CYBER ATTACK ON OUR 

1130
00:32:14,998 --> 00:32:20,371
ELECTIONS, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT 

1131
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,373
THE POOR RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA 

1132
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,741
IS A RESULT OF U.S. 

1133
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:24,074
FOOLISHNESS? 

1134
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:24,675
>> SENATOR, I THINK THERE ARE 

1135
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:25,442
COUNTLESS REASONS. 

1136
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:29,813
YOU IDENTIFIED SEVERAL. 

1137
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:32,150
I COULD GO ON ABOUT THE REASON 

1138
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,451
WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS PLACE 

1139
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,118
WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADAMIR 

1140
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,954
PUTIN AND HIS REGIME, TODAY, 

1141
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,021
NOT A GOOD PLACE, TO BE SURE. 

1142
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:43,661
A PLACE THE PRESIDENT IS WORKING

1143
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,229
TO TRY TO RECONFIGURE, AT LEAST 

1144
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,864
OF THE LEVEL OF MAKING SURE THE 

1145
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,400
LEADERS UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER, 

1146
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,967
AND KNOW HOW EACH OTHER ARE 

1147
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:50,634
THINKING ABOUT THE PROBLEM SET. 

1148
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:52,370
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AND 

1149
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,207
APPROPRIATE AND -- HOPEFULLY, 

1150
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,408
HE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. 

1151
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,076
>> IT IS A NICE ESSAY. 

1152
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:00,811
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION, 

1153
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:02,579
BUT I WILL GO ON. 

1154
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:03,514
THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE IS NO 

1155
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:04,582
LONGER A NUCLEAR THREAT FROM 

1156
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,384
NORTH KOREA AND WE CAN ALL 

1157
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:06,684
SLEEP WELL. 

1158
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:07,718
GIVEN THAT WE DON'T YET HAVE AN 

1159
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:10,154
AGREEMENT ON EVEN SURVEYING 

1160
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:10,988
STOCKPILE OF WHAT NORTH KOREA 

1161
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:13,724
HAS OR AN AGREEMENT ON NEW 

1162
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:14,625
WEAPONS OR MISSILES, OR AN 

1163
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,094
AGREEMENT ON VERIFICATION 

1164
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:22,066
STRATEGIES, SHOULDN'T WE MORE 

1165
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:27,939
ACCURATELY HAVE THE VIEWPOINT 

1166
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,072
THAT THERE STILL IS A NUCLEAR 

1167
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:30,908
THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA? 

1168
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,410
THE PRESIDENT IS WORKING TO 

1169
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,112
ELIMINATE IT, BUT IT IS STILL A 

1170
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,146
NUCLEAR THREAT AS OF TODAY? 

1171
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:37,381
>> YES. I 

1172
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:38,816
THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD AGREE 

1173
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,917
THAT THE PRIMARY SYSTEMS THAT 

1174
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,152
HAVE THREATENED AMERICA 

1175
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,787
CONTINUE TO EXIST. 

1176
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,856
WHAT HIS COMMENT WAS, I THINK, 

1177
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,923
WAS THAT TENSION HAD BEEN 

1178
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:46,323
GREATLY REDUCED. 

1179
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:47,391
>> I WILL TAKE THAT 

1180
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:47,724
DESCRIPTION. 

1181
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:49,794
I'VE GOT 20 SECONDS AND I WANT 

1182
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,928
TO ASK YOU ONE LESS QUESTION ON 

1183
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,763
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TOPIC. 

1184
00:33:52,763 --> 00:33:59,303
45 HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS TRIEBOLD 

1185
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,771
-- TRAVELED TO BURMA AND HAD 

1186
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:01,439
DEVASTATING ATROCITIES. 

1187
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,574
WE HAVE THE REPORT THAT OUR 

1188
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:09,213
AMBASSADOR IS MAKING A 

1189
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:09,513
STATEMENT. 

1190
00:34:09,513 --> 00:34:16,754
IS A TIME FOR THE SENATE TO ACT 

1191
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,054
ON THESE SANCTIONS AGAINST THE 

1192
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:19,322
BURMESE MILITARY THAT WE PASSED 

1193
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:20,791
OUT OF THE SENATE FOREIGN 

1194
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:21,257
RELATIONS COMMITTEE? 

1195
00:34:21,257 --> 00:34:22,326
>> I WILL LEAVE THE SENATORS TO 

1196
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,929
DECIDE IF IT IS TIME FOR THE 

1197
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:25,795
SENATE TO ACT. I 

1198
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:27,465
CAN SEE THE UNDERPINNINGS YOU 

1199
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:28,766
DESCRIBED, THE ATROCITIES, THEY 

1200
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,368
ARE VERY REAL. 

1201
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,638
>> I WOULD SAY THIS IS THE TYPE 

1202
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,039
OF THING WHERE EXECUTIVE 

1203
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,139
LEADERSHIP MAKES A DIFFERENCE 

1204
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,440
AND GIVING DIRECTION TO THIS 

1205
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,042
BODY. 

1206
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,645
I WAS SEEKING YOURS AND THE 

1207
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,411
PRESIDENT'S OPINION ON WHETHER 

1208
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:43,748
IT IS TIME TO SEND A STRONG 

1209
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,248
MISSION AGAINST ETHNIC 

1210
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,819
CLEANSING AND GENOCIDE. 

1211
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:50,288
CAN WE EXPECT SUCH LEADERSHIP 

1212
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,356
FROM THE PRESIDENT OR YOURSELF? 

1213
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,025
>> I REMEMBER WHAT SECRETARY 

1214
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,327
TILLERSON DID BEFORE ME ON THIS 

1215
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:56,560
ISSUE. 

1216
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,631
YOU CAN BE SURE THAT WE WILL BE 

1217
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,700
SERIOUS AND LEAD ON THIS 

1218
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,367
IMPORTANT ISSUE. 

1219
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,301
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR. 

1220
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:05,236
>> MR. SECRETARY, THANK YOU. 

1221
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,703
I APPRECIATE YOUR STAMINA. 

1222
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:09,941
YOU BEEN HERE QUITE A WELL AND 

1223
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,443
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW HOW MUCH 

1224
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,244
I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP, 

1225
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,645
AS YOU'VE FILLED THIS ROLE 

1226
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:19,684
DURING THIS TUMULTUOUS PERIOD 

1227
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,152
IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. 

1228
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,820
I HAVE TO SAY THAT SINCE YOU'VE 

1229
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,388
TAKEN THIS POSITION, THE 

1230
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,490
INTERACTION OUR OFFICE HAS HAD 

1231
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:29,193
WITH MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT 

1232
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,895
OF STATE AND WITH YOU, 

1233
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,364
INDIVIDUALLY, HAS REALLY 

1234
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,464
MARKEDLY IMPROVED. 

1235
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:35,199
I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THAT. 

1236
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,200
ONE OF THE AXIOMS OF DIPLOMATIC 

1237
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,471
OR MILITARY STRATEGY, IS THAT 

1238
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,174
YOU WANT TO UNITE YOUR ALLIES 

1239
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,241
AND DIVIDE YOUR ENEMIES. 

1240
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:48,346
AS I SEE IT, THIS IS ONE OF THE 

1241
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,413
THINGS THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS 

1242
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,681
BEEN SUCCEEDING IN DOING. 

1243
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:51,581
HE SEEKS TO DIVIDE AND WEAKEN 

1244
00:35:51,581 --> 00:35:52,650
NATO, FOR EXAMPLE AND HE WANTS 

1245
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,917
TO DIVIDE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

1246
00:35:53,917 --> 00:36:02,426
THE WAR -- THE MORE WE MAKE THE 

1247
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,995
RUSSIAN MEDDLING A PARTISAN 

1248
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,497
ISSUE, THE MORE WE PLAY INTO 

1249
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,131
PUT IN'S HANDS. 

1250
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:07,732
THE INTELLIENCE COMMUNITY HAS 

1251
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:08,532
BEEN FAIR AND CONSISTENT THAT 

1252
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:14,905
RUSSIA DID INDEED MEDDLE IN THE 

1253
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:15,205
ELECTIONS. 

1254
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:16,474
WE NEED TO STAND TOGETHER AS 

1255
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,409
AMERICANS, NOT REPUBLICANS OR 

1256
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,245
DEMOCRATS, WITH RESPECT TO THIS 

1257
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:21,646
ISSUE. 

1258
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,714
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS 

1259
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,349
MATTER, MR. SECRETARY? 

1260
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,751
>> SENATOR, I THINK IT IS THE 

1261
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:27,752
CASE THAT THE SOVIET UNION AND 

1262
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:32,790
RUSSIA WITH THE EFFORTS TO 

1263
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,423
UNDERMINE WESTERN DEMOCRACY ARE 

1264
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:34,125
LONG AND CONTINUOUS AND 

1265
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:34,892
OCCURRED IN 2016 AND I'M 

1266
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,227
CONFIDENT THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE 

1267
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:41,198
ENDEAVORING TO DIVIDE AND 

1268
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:42,833
SEPARATE US FROM OUR ALLIES, TO 

1269
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,668
CREATE SPACE AND TO FIND 

1270
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:44,335
PARTNERS FOR THEMSELVES AROUND 

1271
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:45,603
THE WORLD, IN THE SAME WAY WE 

1272
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,337
WOULD GO OUT AND WORK 

1273
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,239
DILIGENTLY WITH OUR ALLIES. 

1274
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,507
I ALWAYS THINK THAT HAVING A 

1275
00:36:50,507 --> 00:37:01,819
UNITED DATES PROCESS, WHERE WE 

1276
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,454
HAVE A SHARED GOAL THAT WILL 

1277
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,455
INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF 

1278
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,022
AMERICA PREVAILING AGAINST 

1279
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:05,422
THESE CHALLENGES. 

1280
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:06,590
>> I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH YOU. 

1281
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:11,462
I HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND I 

1282
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:18,602
WILL ADOPT A TONE AND APPROACH 

1283
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:19,537
TO THIS VERY SERIOUS ISSUE THAT 

1284
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,039
IMPACTS ALL AMERICANS, AND 

1285
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:28,011
RECOGNITION OF EVERYTHING YOU 

1286
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:29,713
JUST SAID. 

1287
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:30,715
MR. SECRETARY, ABOUT ONE HOUR 

1288
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:31,282
AGO, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

1289
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:31,782
CONVENED A JOINT PRESS 

1290
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:32,416
CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT 

1291
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,685
OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

1292
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:35,152
JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER. 

1293
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,187
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, THE 

1294
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,290
PRESIDENT AND BOTH PRESIDENTS 

1295
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,491
ANNOUNCED THEY WOULD LAUNCH A 

1296
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:50,701
BILATERAL U.S.-EU SET OF 

1297
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,535
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOAL OF 

1298
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:52,202
REDUCING TERRORISTS, INCREASING 

1299
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:52,803
ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN 

1300
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:59,310
THE EU AND THE UNITED STATES AND

1301
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,379
WORKING TOGETHER TO COUNTER THE 

1302
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:01,979
PREDATORY ECONOMIC PRACTICES 

1303
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,514
THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM COUNTRIES 

1304
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:03,847
LIKE CHINA. 

1305
00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:04,715
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW ENCOURAGED 

1306
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:05,282
I AM BY THIS. 

1307
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:11,822
I THINK WITH OUR COLLECTIVE 

1308
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,090
LEVERAGE BROUGHT TO BEAR, 

1309
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:13,757
PERHAPS ULTIMATELY PULLING IN 

1310
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:14,625
OTHER G-7 COUNTRIES LIKE THE 

1311
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,960
JAPANESE, WE HAVE A REAL 

1312
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:25,336
POSSIBILITY OF REDUCING THE 

1313
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,003
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT AND 

1314
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:26,703
REDUCING THE INCIDENCES OF 

1315
00:38:26,703 --> 00:38:27,738
FORCED TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER WITH 

1316
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:32,709
STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES DUMPING 

1317
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:33,476
THINGS IN OUR OWN ECONOMY, 

1318
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:33,978
PRECISELY WHAT THE 

1319
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,879
ADMINISTRATION HAS FOUR 

1320
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:40,284
OBJECTIVES. 

1321
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,820
DO YOU AGREE THAT THE U.S., 

1322
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,387
MOVING FORWARD, HAS TO 

1323
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:44,155
PRIORITIZE A TRADE DIALOGUE 

1324
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:44,921
WITH THE EU TO ELIMINATE 

1325
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:49,660
CURRENT RETALIATORY TARIFFS ON 

1326
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,494
FARMERS AND MANUFACTURERS IN 

1327
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,228
PLACES LIKE INDIANA, AS WELL IS 

1328
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:56,867
TO EFFECTIVELY COMBAT CHINA'S 

1329
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:57,334
NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES? 

1330
00:38:57,334 --> 00:38:58,034
>> DON'T FORGET KANSAS FARMERS, 

1331
00:38:58,034 --> 00:39:02,606
TOO. 

1332
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,208
I DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF 

1333
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,009
HAVING SEEN THE PRESS 

1334
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:05,810
CONFERENCE BECAUSE I WAS 

1335
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,713
SITTING HERE AND DID NOT SEE THE

1336
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:09,980
ANNOUNCEMENT. I 

1337
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,881
KNOW THIS WAS ONE OF THE THINGS 

1338
00:39:11,881 --> 00:39:12,716
THAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS 

1339
00:39:12,716 --> 00:39:14,284
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN HIS 

1340
00:39:14,284 --> 00:39:15,586
CONVERSATIONS WITH JEAN-CLAUDE 

1341
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,955
JUNCKER AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY 

1342
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,124
MADE SOME PROGRESS AND THAT 

1343
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:20,858
REGARD. 

1344
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,660
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CLEAR 

1345
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,894
WITH RESPECT TO TRADE POLICY. 

1346
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:24,895
EUROPEANS WON'T ACCEPT OUR 

1347
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:25,729
POLICIES AND IF OTHER MARKETS 

1348
00:39:25,729 --> 00:39:26,497
AREN'T OPEN, HE WILL DRIVE 

1349
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,464
TOWARD ZERO TARIFFS, ZERO 

1350
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:34,205
NONTARIFF BARRIERS AND ZERO 

1351
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:34,805
SUBSIDIES. 

1352
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,140
THAT IS THE PLACE HE IS TRYING 

1353
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,241
TO GET TO FOR THE WHOLE WORLD 

1354
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:40,878
AND HE IS CONFIDENT THAT WHEN WE

1355
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,012
GOT THERE, AMERICANS WILL 

1356
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,513
OUTCOMPETE THE REST OF THE 

1357
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:43,747
WORLD. 

1358
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:45,349
WEATHER MANUFACTURERS OR 

1359
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,217
INNOVATORS OR FARMERS OR ALL OF 

1360
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,017
THE ABOVE, THEY WILL ULTIMATELY 

1361
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,319
BE SUCCESSFUL AND THERE WILL BE 

1362
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:57,161
ENORMOUS COOPERATION. 

1363
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,796
>> I FIND THIS EFFORT OF 

1364
00:39:58,796 --> 00:39:59,530
WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH THE 

1365
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,497
EU AND OTHER MAJOR ECONOMIES AS 

1366
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:03,000
COHERENT AND WORKABLE, IF WE 

1367
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,935
ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE 

1368
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:07,304
GREATEST CHALLENGES, THOSE SEEN 

1369
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:10,508
BY THE STATE CAPITALIST 

1370
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:10,808
COUNTRIES. 

1371
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:16,647
CHINA IS THE WORST OFFENDER. 

1372
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,215
I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH CLARITY 

1373
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,617
WITH RESPECT TO TRADE STRATEGY 

1374
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,685
AS I WOULD LIKE TO AND THAT'S 

1375
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:22,820
ONE OF THE REASONS I KEEP 

1376
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,523
EMPHASIZING THAT WE NEED TO 

1377
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,258
HAVE A WRITTEN ONE, JUST AS WE 

1378
00:40:28,258 --> 00:40:30,326
HAVE A NATIONAL SECURITY 

1379
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:31,028
STRATEGY. 

1380
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:31,695
I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF 

1381
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,130
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 

1382
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,065
ANNOUNCEMENT, TODAY. 

1383
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:35,866
LASTLY, MR. SECRETARY, MY HOME 

1384
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:36,766
STATE OF INDIANA IS HOME TO 

1385
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:40,304
23,000 BURMESE AMERICANS. AS I 

1386
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,338
TRAVEL THE STATE AND LISTEN TO 

1387
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,040
SO MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS THAT 

1388
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,343
ARE BURMESE AMERICANS, THEY 

1389
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:50,881
REALLY RATE -- THEY REITERATE 

1390
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,616
THAT THEY HAVE GRAVE CONCERN 

1391
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:59,690
REGARDING THE BURMESE MILITARY'S

1392
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,292
ATROCITIES AGAINST THE ROHAN GOT

1393
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,394
AND THEY WANT THOSE 

1394
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,461
PERPETRATORS BROUGHT TO 

1395
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:04,728
JUSTICE. 

1396
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:05,462
NUMBER TWO, THEY REITERATE A 

1397
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:06,397
DESIRE TO EXPAND TIES BETWEEN 

1398
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:14,271
BURMA AND THE UNITED STATES. 

1399
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,572
THEY EXPRESS CONCERN REGARDING 

1400
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:18,042
THE TREATMENT OF CHIN 

1401
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,743
CHRISTIANS IN BURMA. 

1402
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,513
I KNOW YOU ARE HOSTING THE 

1403
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,013
MINISTERIAL TO ADVANCE 

1404
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:23,714
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOCUSED ON 

1405
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:24,348
COMBATING RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION 

1406
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:25,049
AND DISCRIMINATION AND AS WE 

1407
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:25,649
APPROPRIATELY ADDRESS WITHIN 

1408
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:34,258
THAT FORUM, THE CRISIS IN 

1409
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,091
ROHINGYA, WE WANT ALL RELIGIOUS 

1410
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:41,799
MINORITIES INCLUDING CHRISTIANS 

1411
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,801
TO BE RESPECTED. 

1412
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:44,501
MR. SECRETARY, WILL THE 

1413
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:46,003
DEPARTMENT OF STATE WORK WITH 

1414
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,005
MY OFFICE TO NOT ONLY CONTINUE 

1415
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,274
THE JOINT EFFORTS RELATED TO THE

1416
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,075
ROHINGYA, WHICH I SUPPORT BUT 

1417
00:41:52,075 --> 00:41:54,177
ALSO TO ENCOURAGE THE BURMESE 

1418
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:55,578
GOVERNMENT TO END ANY POLICIES 

1419
00:41:55,578 --> 00:41:56,379
THAT TREAT CHRISTIANS AS SECOND-

1420
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:56,746
CLASS CITIZENS. 

1421
00:41:56,746 --> 00:41:57,615
>> YES, SENATOR, I WILL. 

1422
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:04,788
>> THANK YOU. 

1423
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:05,890

1424
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,224
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 

1425
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,525
MR. SECRETARY, FOR BEING HERE. 

1426
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:09,893
I ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH MANY OF 

1427
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:14,765
THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE 

1428
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:15,399
CHAIRMAN AND THE 

1429
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:15,766
ADMINISTRATION. 

1430
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:16,600
THE PRESIDENT IS MAKING UP 

1431
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,470
FOREIGN-POLICY ON A DAY BY DAY 

1432
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,371
BASIS. I 

1433
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,172
THINK YOU'VE GOT A TIGER BY THE 

1434
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,474
TAIL WITH A DIFFICULT AND 

1435
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,375
ENVIABLE JOB AND I APPRECIATE 

1436
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,676
YOU SPENDING TIME WITH US THIS 

1437
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:29,013
MORNING. 

1438
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:31,014
WE FOCUS ON WORDS FROM THE 

1439
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:32,816
PRESIDENT BECAUSE OUR ALLIES 

1440
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,118
AND ADVERSARIES LISTEN TO THOSE 

1441
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:34,685
WORDS AND CALIBRATE ACTIONS 

1442
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:35,219
BASED UPON THOSE WORDS. 

1443
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,119
WHILE YOU ARE RIGHT THAT THE 

1444
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:43,560
PRESIDENT -- 20-30 HOURS LATER 

1445
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,562
-- HE CORRECTED HIMSELF AFTER 

1446
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:46,296
THE HELSINKI SUMMIT TO SAY THAT 

1447
00:42:46,296 --> 00:42:47,464
HE DID, INDEED, AGREE WITH U.S. 

1448
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:48,064
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND NOT 

1449
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:50,367
WITH FOOD AND. 

1450
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:51,735
FIVE DAYS LATER, HE WENT BACK 

1451
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:56,974
ON TWITTER. 

1452
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,443
HE SAID THIS -- SO, PRESIDENT 

1453
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,879
OBAMA KNEW ABOUT RUSSIA BEFORE 

1454
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:02,212
THE ELECTION. 

1455
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,014
WHY DIDN'T HE DO SOMETHING 

1456
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:04,281
ABOUT IT? 

1457
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,249
WHY DIDN'T HE TELL OUR 

1458
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:05,516
CAMPAIGN? 

1459
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,817
BECAUSE, IT IS ALL A BIG HOAX, 

1460
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:13,323
THAT'S WHY. 

1461
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:15,325
THAT IS THE MOST RECENT 

1462
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:15,992
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT, 

1463
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:16,627
ú 

1464
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,394
INTERFERENCE OF THE ELECTION IS 

1465
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:21,732
ALL A BIG HOAX. 

1466
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:22,599
MY QUESTION IS, WHY SHOULDN'T 

1467
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:23,434
WE ACCEPT THIS MOST RECENT 

1468
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:29,506
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT AS 

1469
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:30,340
U.S. POLICY, RATHER THAN THE 

1470
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:30,974
STATEMENT THAT YOU REFERENCED 

1471
00:43:30,974 --> 00:43:31,708
ON JULY 17? 

1472
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:35,445
>> SENATOR, I CAN'T GO THROUGH 

1473
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:37,347
THE LITANY OF ALL THE 

1474
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:37,981
STATEMENTS YOU JUST GAVE. 

1475
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:39,183
I HAVE A LIST FROM JANUARY 17, 

1476
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:47,157
JUNE 17, AGAIN IN JULY AND I'M 

1477
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,359
HAPPY TO GO THROUGH THEM. 

1478
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,994
IN EACH OF THEM, THE PRESIDENT 

1479
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:52,462
CONFIRMED HE UNDERSTOOD THAT 

1480
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:53,230
RUSSIANS HAD MEDDLED IN THE 

1481
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,598
ELECTION AND ALTHOUGH I 

1482
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:55,866
COULDN'T RECOUNT THEM, I COULD 

1483
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,836
TELL YOU NUMBERS OF TIMES WHEN 

1484
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,170
I WAS PERSONALLY WITH HIM WHERE 

1485
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,472
HE TOLD ME DIRECTLY THAT HE 

1486
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,039
UNDERSTOOD THAT. 

1487
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,643
AND, INDEED COSMA , PROVIDED 

1488
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:14,151
GUIDANCE FOR PUSHING BACK ON 

1489
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,119
THIS INTERFERENCE. 

1490
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,255
I HAVE A CATALOG OF ITEMS TO DO 

1491
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:19,323
JUST THAT. 

1492
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,792
>> WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE MOST 

1493
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,192
RECENT STATEMENT? 

1494
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,827
>> YOU CAN SPECULATE AND DRAW 

1495
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,661
YOUR INFERENCES FOR WHATEVER 

1496
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:26,563
PURPOSES YOU CHOOSE BUT WHAT I 

1497
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,263
CAN TELL YOU -- 

1498
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,632
>> THERE IS NO INFERENCE. 

1499
00:44:29,632 --> 00:44:31,235
IT'S A STATEMENT FROM THE 

1500
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,770
PRESIDENT IN WHICH HE SAYS THE 

1501
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:33,370
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 

1502
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,439
U.S. ELECTION IS A HOAX FROM 

1503
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:36,073
JULY 22ND. 

1504
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,675
THERE IS NO INFERENCE I NEED TO 

1505
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:39,543
DRAW FROM THAT. 

1506
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,878
IT IS A SENATOR'S STATEMENT. 

1507
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:43,079
>> SENATOR, YOU'RE CERTAINLY 

1508
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,848
TRYING TO DRAW INFERENCES ABOUT 

1509
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,316
THE AMERICAN POLICY AND I'M 

1510
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,685
LAYING OUT FOR YOU AMERICAN 

1511
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:49,453
POLICY. 

1512
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,488
LET ME TALK TO ABOUT WHAT WE'VE 

1513
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:52,222
DONE ON ELECTION INTERFERENCE, 

1514
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,023
IF I MIGHT. 

1515
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,893
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DRAW A 

1516
00:44:56,893 --> 00:44:58,295
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE 

1517
00:44:58,295 --> 00:44:59,029
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS AND U.S. 

1518
00:44:59,029 --> 00:44:59,262
POLICY. 

1519
00:44:59,262 --> 00:45:00,030
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SUGGEST IS 

1520
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,265
THAT WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS IS 

1521
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:07,171
U.S. POLICY -- BECAUSE 

1522
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:07,905
ADERSARIES AND ALLIES MAKE 

1523
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:08,672
DECISIONS BASED ON THOSE 

1524
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:15,746
COMMENTS -- LET ME DRILL DOWN 

1525
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,614
ON A SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT 

1526
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,382
SENATOR CORKER RAISED. 

1527
00:45:19,382 --> 00:45:20,250
THOSE ARE THE COMMENTS MADE 

1528
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:20,951
REGARDING THE POTENTIAL DEFENSE 

1529
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:21,952
OR NONDEFENSE OF MONTENEGRO. 

1530
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:27,758
TUCKER CARLSON ASKED THAT 

1531
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,360
MONTENEGRO MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO 

1532
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,495
A SMALL TO BE DEFENDED AND THE 

1533
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,096
PRESIDENT UNDERSTAND DID -- 

1534
00:45:33,096 --> 00:45:34,198
SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THAT 

1535
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:35,799
MONTENEGRO WAS A TINY COUNTRY 

1536
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,033
WAS STRONG PEOPLE. 

1537
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:38,869
I KNOW YOU WILL TELL ME THAT 

1538
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:39,903
THE OFFICIAL POLICY OF THE U.S. 

1539
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,837
IS TO DEFEND MONTENEGRO AND 

1540
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:44,908
DEFEND OUR NATO ALLIES. 

1541
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,344
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHY WE WOULD 

1542
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,878
BE CONCERNED THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1543
00:45:48,878 --> 00:45:50,848
WOULD DRAW A QUESTION AS TO 

1544
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,482
WHETHER WE WOULD DEFEND 

1545
00:45:52,482 --> 00:45:52,815
MONTENEGRO? 

1546
00:45:52,815 --> 00:45:54,318
IN THE END, THAT IS A 

1547
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,219
COMMUNICATION OF RUSSIAN 

1548
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,286
PRESIDENT VLADAMIR PUTIN ABOUT 

1549
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,120
WHETHER THE PRESIDENT IS GOING 

1550
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,122
TO COME TO NATO'S DEFENSE. 

1551
00:45:59,122 --> 00:46:01,325
AS YOU KNOW, AN ATTACK ON NATO 

1552
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:02,392
WON'T BE A RUSSIAN ARMY MOVING 

1553
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:03,360
ACROSS THE BORDER, IT WILL BE A 

1554
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,298
CYBER ATTACK OR THERE SHOULD BE 

1555
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,100
QUESTIONED WEATHER THE U.S. 

1556
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,335
SHOULD RESPOND, OR NOT. 

1557
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,637
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHY WE MIGHT 

1558
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:14,437
BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESENT 

1559
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:15,305
RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THE 

1560
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,909
UTILITY OF THE UNITED STATES 

1561
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,945
DEFENDING MONTENEGRO? 

1562
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,247
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS 

1563
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,081
BEEN UNAMBIGUOUSLY CLEAR AND I 

1564
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:28,451
CAN READ YOU HIS POLICIES. 

1565
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:30,753
>> HIS POLICIES OR THE SEPARATE 

1566
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:31,321
STATEMENTS? 

1567
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:32,923
I'M ASKING ABOUT THIS 

1568
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:33,657
STATEMENT. 

1569
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,325
EXPLAIN IT TO US. 

1570
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,827
WHAT DID HE MEAN? 

1571
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,962
>> SENATOR, THE POLICIES ARE, 

1572
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,432
THEMSELVES, STATEMENTS, AS 

1573
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:42,632
WELL. 

1574
00:46:42,632 --> 00:46:43,800
INDEED, THE MOST IMPORTANT 

1575
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,835
STATEMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION 

1576
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:45,068
MAKES. 

1577
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,670
>> POLICIES ARE STATEMENTS AND 

1578
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,637
STATEMENTS ARE POLICIES? 

1579
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:50,374
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. I

1580
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,142
MAKE LOTS OF STATEMENTS THAT 

1581
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:52,843
AREN'T U.S. POLICY. 

1582
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:53,543
THE PRESIDENT MAKES COMMENTS IN 

1583
00:46:53,543 --> 00:46:54,211
CERTAIN PLACES AND WE MEET AND 

1584
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,947
LAYOUT STRATEGIES AND DEVELOP 

1585
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:57,347
POLICIES, RIGHT? 

1586
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:08,592
>> HOW I KNOW -- HOW WOULD I 

1587
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:10,193
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE? 

1588
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:13,430
>> SENATOR, HERE'S WHAT YOU 

1589
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,264
SHOULD LOOK AT. 

1590
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,031
COMPARE THE FOLLOWING -- BARACK 

1591
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:15,865
OBAMA SPEAKING TOUGH ON RUSSIA 

1592
00:47:15,865 --> 00:47:16,466
AND DOING NOTHING. 

1593
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:20,270
>> THAT ISN'T TRUE. 

1594
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:20,937
>> IT IS TRUE. 

1595
00:47:20,937 --> 00:47:21,905
>> A UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO 

1596
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:26,076
REWRITE THE OBAMA RUSSIAN 

1597
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,344
POLICY. 

1598
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,646
>> THERE IS A COMPREHENSIVE SET 

1599
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,514
OF SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA. 

1600
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:34,017
>> THE MAN SAID HE WOULD HAVE 

1601
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,118
MORE FLEXIBILITY AFTER. 

1602
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,286
>> MY QUESTION ISN'T A BOAT 

1603
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:36,486
THAT. 

1604
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,654
>> I JUST WANT TO LOOK AT THE 

1605
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:38,422
FACTS. 

1606
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:44,194
I'M TRYING TO GET TO U.S. 

1607
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:44,594
POLICY. 

1608
00:47:44,594 --> 00:47:44,961
IT'S WHAT I DO. 

1609
00:47:44,961 --> 00:47:45,561
I'M AMERICA'S CHIEF DIPLOMAT 

1610
00:47:45,561 --> 00:47:46,128
IMPLEMENTING U.S. POLICY. 

1611
00:47:46,128 --> 00:47:48,732
>> I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN DEALT 

1612
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,133
A TOUGH HAND AND YOU'VE DONE AN 

1613
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,502
INCREDIBLE JOB WITH IT. 

1614
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:53,904
LET ME ASK A LESS ADVERSARIAL 

1615
00:47:53,904 --> 00:48:02,512
QUESTION TO END WITH. 

1616
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,781
YOU SAID TWO VERY IMPORTANT 

1617
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,916
THINGS ON NORTH KOREA. 

1618
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:08,919
YOU SAID THEY HAVE AGREED TO 

1619
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:09,586
DENUCLEARIZE AND THAT THEY 

1620
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,588
UNDERSTAND OUR DEFINITION OF 

1621
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:12,356
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

1622
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,056
>> THAT'S CORRECT. 

1623
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:17,461
>> WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS 

1624
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,563
THAT THOSE STATEMENTS A LINK, 

1625
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,331
AND THEY HAVE AGREED TO 

1626
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,299
DENUCLEARIZE ACCORDING TO OUR 

1627
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,033
DEFINITION OF DENUCLEARIZATION. 

1628
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:23,666
IS THAT YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY? 

1629
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:24,467
>> THE DEFINITION WAS SET 

1630
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:29,906
FORWARD AND DENUCLEARIZATION 

1631
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:30,473
WAS AGREED TO. 

1632
00:48:30,473 --> 00:48:32,009
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE -- I 

1633
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,643
DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO SAY IT. 

1634
00:48:33,643 --> 00:48:37,114
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO GIVE YOU A 

1635
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:37,414
HARD TIME. 

1636
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,149
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND 

1637
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:39,316
IT. 

1638
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,351
>> I'M TRYING TO ARTICULATE 

1639
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,885
WHAT WAS AGREED TO. 

1640
00:48:42,885 --> 00:48:45,389
WE MADE CLEAR WHAT WE VIEWED AS
