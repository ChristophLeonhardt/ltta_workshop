1
00:00:01,404 --> 00:00:02,138
KAVANAUGH, A MAN WITH IMPECCABLE

2
00:00:02,138 --> 00:00:02,805
SERVICE AND A 40 YEAR TRACK

3
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:03,439
RECORD, THEY CAN TAKE DOWN

4
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:03,773
ANYBODY.

5
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:04,507
ANY CONSERVATIVE, ANY POLITICIAN

6
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:05,241
FOR ANY REASON ON ANY ALLEGATION

7
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:05,808
WITH ZERO PROOF, EVER.

8
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:06,442
THE SENATE CANNOT LET THIS

9
00:00:06,442 --> 00:00:06,776
HAPPEN.

10
00:00:06,776 --> 00:00:07,377
THEY CANNOT REWARD THIS

11
00:00:07,377 --> 00:00:07,744
BEHAVIOR.

12
00:00:07,744 --> 00:00:08,511
JOINING US NOW, SOUTH CAROLINA

13
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:09,112
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM.

14
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:10,713
SENATOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU,

15
00:00:10,713 --> 00:00:11,080
THANK YOU.

16
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,050
I'VE KNOWN YOU A LONG TIME.

17
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:14,951
>> 20 YEARS.

18
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:16,119
>> Sean: AS IT WAS HAPPENING

19
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:18,021
OF HIS LIFE ON MY RADIO SHOW AND

20
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:20,723
ON MY NEXT BREAK, I DON'T THINK

21
00:00:20,723 --> 00:00:22,659
YOU EVER HAD A MORE POWERFUL

22
00:00:22,659 --> 00:00:24,928
MOMENT IN YOUR CAREER.

23
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:25,962
>> Senator Graham: I JUST TOLD

24
00:00:25,962 --> 00:00:26,362
THE TRUTH.

25
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:28,531
IT'S NOT ABOUT FINDING THE TRUTH

26
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:29,432
BETWEEN DR. FORD AND BRETT

27
00:00:29,432 --> 00:00:31,301
KAVANAUGH, IS ABOUT DELAYING THE

28
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:32,702
HEARING TO GET PAST THE

29
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:33,770
MIDTERMS, I HOPE THEY PICK UP

30
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,271
THE SENATE AND DENYING THE SEAT

31
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:38,742
TO BE FILLED BY DONALD TRUMP.

32
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,343
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FBI, AND IF

33
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:41,911
YOU REALLY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT

34
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:43,046
THE FBI THOUGHT ABOUT THIS, YOU

35
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:44,547
WOULD COME FORWARD WHEN HE FIRST

36
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:46,016
KNEW ABOUT IT.

37
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:47,550
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT ABOUT

38
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,318
PROTECTING DR. FORD.

39
00:00:48,318 --> 00:00:49,252
THE ONE THING I LEARNED BEYOND

40
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:52,722
ANY DOUBT TODAY, ANY DOUBT, IS

41
00:00:52,722 --> 00:00:55,959
YOU NEVER INTENDED TO PROTECT

42
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:56,326
DR. FORD.

43
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:57,794
EVERYTHING I BELIEVED I KNEW

44
00:00:57,794 --> 00:00:58,895
ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH, I AM MORE

45
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:02,232
CONVINCED THAN EVER THAT HE

46
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:03,333
DIDN'T DO IT.

47
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,334
HE IS THE RIGHT GUY TO BE ON THE

48
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:05,635
COURT.

49
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:07,337
MS. FORD HAS A PROBLEM AND

50
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:08,004
DESTROYING JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S

51
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:10,140
LIFE WON'T FIX HER PROBLEM.

52
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,109
AND IF WE LEGITIMIZE THIS, GOD

53
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:12,843
HELP US ALL BECAUSE BOTH SIDES

54
00:01:12,843 --> 00:01:15,378
CAN DO THIS TO MY FRIENDS ON THE

55
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:16,046
OTHER SIDE.

56
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:16,880
I WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THIS TO

57
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,784
ONE OF YOUR NOMINEES.

58
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:23,954
YOU VOTED FOR PEOPLE THAT I

59
00:01:23,954 --> 00:01:27,324
KNOW -- >> Sean: YOU SHARED

60
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:31,161
YOUR JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY.

61
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:32,796
'S BEFORE IT USED TO BE IF YOU

62
00:01:32,796 --> 00:01:37,100
ARE QUALIFIED, ELECTIONS MATTER.

63
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,402
NOW WHEN WE WIN, OR DONALD TRUMP

64
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:44,107
WINS, THERE ARE NO RULES OR

65
00:01:44,107 --> 00:01:46,843
BOUNDARIES.

66
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:49,112
NOT ONLY IS HE THAT INCREDIBLY

67
00:01:49,112 --> 00:01:50,547
QUALIFIED JUDGE, OR AN

68
00:01:50,547 --> 00:01:52,315
INCREDIBLY DECENT MAN, HE AND

69
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:53,984
HIS WIFE ARE THE PARENTS OF THE

70
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:54,351
YEAR.

71
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,219
IF THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE AN

72
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,287
AWARD FOR PARENTING, I WOULD

73
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:59,122
GIVE TO ASHLEY AND BRETT BASED

74
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:01,058
ON WHAT HIS DAUGHTER SAID ABOUT

75
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:02,192
WHO TO PAY FOR.

76
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:04,227
SO I'M HONORED TO HELP HIM.

77
00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:05,529
IF I HELPED HIM TODAY, IT'S ONE

78
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:07,865
OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY CAREER.

79
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:09,466
AND TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES,

80
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:11,768
IF THIS GUY GOES DOWN, THEN WE

81
00:02:11,768 --> 00:02:14,538
DON'T DESERVE TO STAY IN POWER,

82
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:16,173
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT POWER TO

83
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:16,440
ME.

84
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,711
IT IS ABOUT THE PROCESS.

85
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:22,946
JOE MANCHIN, I LIKED HIM A LOT.

86
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:25,549
JOE, YOU CAN'T FIGURE THIS OUT,

87
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:26,950
TRUMP WON BY 40 POINTS.

88
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,952
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT BRETT

89
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:29,953
KAVANAUGH IS A SERIAL?

90
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:33,323
DO YOU BELIEVE ANY OF THIS

91
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:34,358
GARBAGE?

92
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:35,159
I'M SORRY THAT DR. FORD WENT

93
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,693
THROUGH THIS, SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE

94
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:38,162
HAD TO GO THROUGH IT BUT I'M

95
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:39,196
CONVINCED BEYOND ANY SHADOW OF A

96
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:39,997
DOUBT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH IS

97
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:41,498
NOT THE MAN THAT THEY ARE TRYING

98
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:43,834
TO MAKE HIM AND THIS IS ALL

99
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:44,201
POLITICAL.

100
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:48,172
SO JOE I HOPE YOU STEP UP.

101
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:50,340
HEIDI, I HOPE LIKE YOU A LOT.

102
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,810
JOE DONNELLY, GREAT GUY.

103
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,144
WHY CAN'T YOU TALK ABOUT WHETHER

104
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:57,381
OR NOT WE MET THE BURDEN HERE?

105
00:02:57,381 --> 00:02:58,916
IF HE HAD TO PROVE HE WAS

106
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:03,954
INNOCENT, HE DID IT FOR ME, BUT

107
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:04,488
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

108
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,290
>> Sean: REPUBLICANS MET IN

109
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,560
CONFERENCE TONIGHT AND, BRING US

110
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,695
INSIDE THE MEETING IS MUCH AS

111
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:15,132
YOU ARE ABLE TO SHARE.

112
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:17,068
>> I WAS BLOWN AWAY.

113
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:20,738
CAN YOU IMAGINE DOING WHAT HE

114
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:21,138
DID TODAY?

115
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:23,941
YOUR LIFE IS RIPPED APART,

116
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:25,176
YOU'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS FOR

117
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:26,377
WEEKS AND THEY SPRING IT OUT YOU

118
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:29,246
OUT ON THE, AND THEN MICHAEL

119
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:34,218
AVENATTI COMES OUT AND SAYS YOU

120
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:35,353
ASSAULT WOMEN AND YOUR WHOLE

121
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:38,155
LIFE IS ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED?

122
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:38,889
I THINK REPUBLICANS TODAY FELT

123
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:41,692
LIKE BRETT KAVANAUGH NOT ONLY

124
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:48,532
MET THE TEST AND PASS THE TEST,

125
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:52,703
AND I WILL BE BROKENHEARTED.

126
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:55,206
IF THE SENATE REJECTS THIS GOOD

127
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:56,340
MAN.

128
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,742
>> Sean: BOB CORKER SAID YES,

129
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:58,776
JEFF FLAKE OFF-CAMERA SAID THIS

130
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:01,512
IS A TOUGH ONE.

131
00:04:01,512 --> 00:04:02,747
>> Senator Graham: I WOULD SAY

132
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:03,347
IT IS TOUGH.

133
00:04:03,347 --> 00:04:04,982
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO

134
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:06,283
DR. FORD BUT I'VE BEEN A LAWYER

135
00:04:06,283 --> 00:04:08,619
ALL MY LIFE, I USE TO DO THIS

136
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:09,520
FOR A LIVING.

137
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,188
YOU COULD GET A WARRANT.

138
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:12,957
SHE CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE IT

139
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:15,760
HAPPENED OR WHAT HAPPENED, IT'S

140
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,560
NOT HE SAID, SHE SAID, IT'S THEY

141
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,630
SAID AND THEY SAID.

142
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,798
ALL PEOPLE NAMES THAT IT DIDN'T

143
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:21,332
HAPPENED.

144
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:23,000
AND YOU CAN'T GET THE DATE OR

145
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,401
THE TIME.

146
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:26,337
MY GOD, HE WENT THROUGH A

147
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:28,039
COUNTER OF 1982, THIS IS THE

148
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,340
MOST SQUARED AWAY GUY THAT I'VE

149
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:29,940
EVER MET MY LIFE.

150
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,977
I WAS HONORED TO BE IN HIS

151
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:33,511
PRESENCE.

152
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:34,579
I'VE NEVER SEEN A MAN COMMANDED

153
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:35,880
A ROOM LIKE HE DID, I'VE NEVER

154
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,752
SEEN ANYONE MORE HE IS ABUSE

155
00:04:40,752 --> 00:04:46,524
THAN HE WAS.

156
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:47,392
>> Sean: I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN

157
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:48,092
QUOTING SUSAN COLLINS BECAUSE

158
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:48,760
SHE IS THE ONE THAT RIGHTLY

159
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,763
POINTED OUT FROM THE BEGINNING,

160
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:52,664
THIS HAS BEEN UNFAIR TO BOTH

161
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:53,498
SIDES HERE.

162
00:04:53,498 --> 00:04:55,800
AND SHE'S BEEN RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

163
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,501
>> Senator Graham: WHAT I

164
00:04:56,501 --> 00:05:00,271
WOULD TELL SUSAN IS, IF YOU ARE

165
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:01,806
THE WAY THEY SAY BRETT IS, HE

166
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:02,941
WOULDN'T HAVE THE LIFE BRETT HAS

167
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:03,341
LIVED.

168
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:05,777
HE WOULDN'T HAVE 65 WOMEN COMING

169
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:07,712
FORWARD, WE WOULDN'T HAVE SIX

170
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:08,580
FBI INVESTIGATIONS THAT FOUND

171
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,381
NOTHING, YOU WOULDN'T BE IN THIS

172
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:10,882
PROFILE OF A JOB.

173
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:12,984
HE'S BEEN IN THE HIGHEST LEVELS

174
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:15,487
OF GOVERNMENT, A TARGET FOR 26

175
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:15,987
YEARS.

176
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:17,789
HE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AFTER THE

177
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:18,490
HEARING WAS OVER, THEY KNEW

178
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,525
ABOUT IT AND THEY SAT ON IT,

179
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:22,894
THERE IS NO CORROBORATION.

180
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:24,562
AND THE MICHAEL AVENATTI THING

181
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:25,930
TELLS YOU WHERE THEY ARE HEADED

182
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,564
WITH HIM.

183
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:27,765
IF THEY DELAY THIS, THERE WILL

184
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,434
BE MORE COMING AND HE DOESN'T

185
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:30,568
DESERVE THAT.

186
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:32,771
IT'S TIME TO VOTE.

187
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:33,538

QUALIFIED AND CAPABLE AND I WILL

00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:46,484

196
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:48,420
HAPPENED HERE IN THE

197
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,287
CONFIRMATION PROCESS.

198
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:51,022
IF THIS IS THE NEW NORM, GOD

00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:52,824
HELP US ALL.

200
00:05:52,824 --> 00:05:54,359
I HOPE JEFF CAN GET THERE.

201
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:56,361
I WOULD JUST STRESS AGAIN, THIS

202
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:58,496
MAN HAS LED AN INCREDIBLE LIFE

203
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:00,065
AND EVERYTHING THEY ARE SAYING

204
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:01,600
ABOUT HIM IS MADE UP AND IT

205
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,470
COMES OUT OF THE LEFT FIELD.

206
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,038
IT'S NOT CORROBORATED.

207
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:08,173
PLEASE DON'T TAKE AWAY

208
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:10,008
EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE.

209
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:12,611
HE'S NUMBER ONE IN HIS CLASS,

210
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:13,745
EVER SINCE HE'S DONE ANYTHING.

211
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:16,615
IF WE GO TO THE FLOOR OF THE

212
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:19,485
SENATE, -- IF YOU LIVE IN THESE

213
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:25,157
TRUMP STATES, GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

214
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:27,659
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE EMOTION OF

215
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:31,163
TODAY, AND ALL THAT HAPPENED, --

216
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:32,965
MY BEST FRIEND FROM THIRD GRADE,

217
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:34,533
HIS NAME IS JOHN GOMEZ AND HE

218
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,767
CALLED ME YESTERDAY.

219
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,970
HE SAID HANNITY, YOU ALWAYS SAY

220
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,405
EVERY 2-4 YEARS, REPUBLICANS ARE

221
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:41,874
RACIST AND SEXIST AND MY WHOLE

222
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:43,542
LIST AS HE CALLS LATE.

223
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:44,309
I THINK I UNDERSTAND A LITTLE

224
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:47,946
MORE NOW BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY

225
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:48,647
THESE HORRIBLE THINGS, AND NOW

226
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:51,216
WE HAVE GOTTEN USED TO IT, WE

227
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:53,752
EXPECT IT, IT'S LIKE MY FATHER

228
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:56,855
WAS KILLED ALL OVER AGAIN.

229
00:06:56,989 --> 00:06:55,988
CHURCHES WILL BURN OUR     OR CO

230
00:06:55,988 --> 00:07:01,593
ELECT REPUBLICANS AND BLACK

231
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:01,960
CHURCHES WILL BURN OUR     OR CS

232
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,162
WILL BURN.

233
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:05,130
REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO COUNT

234
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,565
AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE CENSUS,

235
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:07,766
AL GORE SAID.

236
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,735
THIS HAS TO STOP, SENATOR.

237
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:10,402
>> Senator Graham: THESE ARE

238
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:12,771
POLITICAL ARGUMENTS THAT WE CAN

239
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:15,941
HANDLE AND WE DON'T LIKE THAT

240
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:17,776
BUT THIS IS DESTROYING SOMEBODY.

241
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:18,444
>> Sean: YES.

242
00:07:18,444 --> 00:07:19,245
>> Senator Graham: I WOULD

243
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,613
HOPE AND PRAY THAT I NEVER GET

244
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:21,714
THIS DESPERATE AS A POLITICAL

245
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:23,949
PERSON TO DESTROY SOMEBODY.

246
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,317
THIS WAS A WHOLESALE EFFORT TO

247
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:27,019
TAKE A GOOD MAN AND RUIN HIS

248
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:28,988
LIFE AND IT BACKFIRED ON HIM.

249
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:30,356
THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICAL

250
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:31,223
ARGUMENTS, THIS IS NOT ABOUT

251
00:07:31,223 --> 00:07:34,226
WHAT THEY WILL DO OR WE WILL DO,

252
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:36,429
THIS IS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE

253
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:37,363
WERE WILLING TO SET A MAN UP AND

254
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:43,569
DESTROY HIS LIFE.

255
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:46,172
>> Sean: IT WAS HARD TO WATCH.

256
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:46,872
>> Senator Graham: IT WAS HARD

257
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:47,940
TO WATCH AND WHEN HE TALKED

258
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,775
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER -- LET'S PRAY

259
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:50,977
FOR THE LADY, TOO.

260
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:54,180
THIS IS A GOOD MAN, PLEASE VOTE

261
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,580
FOR HIM.

262
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,481
>> Sean: SENATOR I THINK THE

263
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:56,882
REASON YOUR MOMENT WAS SO

264
00:07:56,882 --> 00:08:00,286
POWERFUL IS IT WAS RAW, REAL AND

265
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:01,153
UNPLANNED.

266
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:01,787
>> Senator Graham: IT WAS

267
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:03,990
TOTALLY REAL.

268
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,925
US BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT GOT ME

269
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:07,360
WAS, WHY WON'T YOU AGREE TO THE

270
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,162
FBI INVESTIGATION, WHAT DO YOU

271
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:10,396
HAVE TO HIDE?

272
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:11,130
THESE OF THE SAME PEOPLE THAT

273
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,732
MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO DO

274
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:14,367
AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE IT

275
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:14,901
WOULDN'T HELP US.

276
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:16,803
THEY KNEW IT FOR WEEKS, PLANNED

277
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:18,604
WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND

278
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:19,205
INTENTIONALLY, AND I AM

279
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:20,573
CONVINCED TO COME OUT AT

280
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:22,975
DR. FORD FOR THE PUTTER, WE SAW

281
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:25,211
TODAY AND IT BLEW UP IN THEIR

282
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:26,179
FACE.

283
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:26,913
AND I HOPE AMERICA UNDERSTANDS

284
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:28,681
THAT IF THIS IS THE NEW WAY OF

285
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:32,385
DOING BUSINESS, WE ARE GOING IN

286
00:08:32,385 --> 00:00:00,000
THE WRONG DIRECTION.
