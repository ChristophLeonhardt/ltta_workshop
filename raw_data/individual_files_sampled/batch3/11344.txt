in Germany tens of thousands of now signed a petition against a website where students are encouraged to report politically biased teachers the online portal neutral schools was first launched by the anti-immigration alternative for Germany AFD party it was designed to try to assess whether or not teachers were breaking neutrality rules by revealing their political tendencies but critics say actually it's echoing one of the country's darkest chapters as Anisha Sethi explains under pressure to perform in the classroom nervous about being picked on I'm not talking about students here but teachers themselves because in Germany teachers political peers can now be reported on by students anonymously the anti immigrants alternative for Germany party launched a website in Berlin to monitor what they call political neutrality and they plan to expand it across the country we found that quite a lot of teachers obviously not all teachers but quite a lot of teachers they tend to convey a bias against our party to their pupils and students school should be a neutral place our Constitution wants it to be in your own face and it should not be a biased place against one party or another according to the eighth day examples of suppose the defense's includes educators criticizing the air base platform wearing t-shirts with anti party slogans or encouraging children to take part in an TFA protest to prove their point the largest opposition party in the Bundestag or even publishing concerns of disgruntled students claiming their conservative reviews may affect their grade a student who like me needs very good grades is better off not expressing himself politically in school in Germany a student with conservative views is muzzled since its launch the portal has received a huge response from teachers but an unexpected one because someone to be blacklisted voluntarily we will inform our students when members and officials of your party run racist anti-semitic or anti-democratic activities that endanger our peaceful coexistence in society we would be honored if you could our names on their list of denunciations the country's Justice Minister has condemned the practice comparing it to the methods of the notorious former secret police in East Germany the party says it's merely advocating Germany's pre-existing neutrality law but others say it raises suspicion for putting the rulebook aside is the classroom really a place for politics well if they don't seem to think so we don't want to harm any teacher we want to create trouble we don't want to make life horrible for them but we want schools to be a neutral place I don't think the political party should be launching such an online portal I think that they don't want teachers to speak openly about Nazi history of German and they want to stop that they want their version of political history to be taught in classrooms throughout Germany you
