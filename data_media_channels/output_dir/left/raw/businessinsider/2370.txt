have we borrowed ourselves to death are

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,880
we headed for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two decade long period</font>

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,830
of economic hell like Japan which is

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,199
also borrowing up the wazoo our guest

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,090
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> John Mauldin you've been very</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">vocal about saying that we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,380
headed down a dangerous course long term

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,029
not near term but long term with the

9
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,600
borrowing may not well the real<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,850
is that when you take all the

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,950
mathematical equations and so savings

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,660
equals investments so when the

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">government is dis saving that means you</font>

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,110
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and businesses and foreigners and</font>

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kindness of strangers have to make</font>

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,739
up so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have something for</font>

17
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,180
investment because you've got to have

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,860
investments from<font color="#E5E5E5"> / into private</font>

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,300
companies that's where the jobs come

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,920
from and even that sort of what the

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,270
government is trying to do with our

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,410
Achilles money in it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> short-term</font>

23
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">government spending will increase GDP</font>

24
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,799
but in the long term it has it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">a multiplier effect so what we need is</font>

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,680
private industry investing and that's

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,390
where the real jobs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> growth comes</font>

28
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,180
from so that's when the Keynesian<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,830
in and argue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well we need some</font>

30
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,270
stimulus to make up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the drop of</font>

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,939
consumption<font color="#E5E5E5"> there correct but it doesn't</font>

32
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">help long term and long term if you keep</font>

33
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">running trillion-dollar deficits or as</font>

34
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,799
more realistic assessments it goes back

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,060
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 2 trillion by the end of this</font>

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,670
decade you suck all of the air out of

37
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,040
the room that's why Japan has had no job

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,850
creation for 20 years their nominal GDP

39
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,000
is where it was 17 years ago and we run

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,170
the same danger what we got to do is to

41
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,140
get the deficit down and put incentives

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,899
in for private businesses to create jobs

43
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,340
so I got to ask whether we're going to

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,630
become Japan<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounds horrible</font>

45
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">but first so when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to kill</font>

46
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,119
us we have we got a lot of debt now but

47
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,890
Japan had a lot of debt 15 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

48
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,920
japan japan had fifteen percent savings

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,960
rates and they sucked all the savings

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,000
into the end of the government system we

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,470
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifteen percent savings right</font>

52
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,730
now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go up to seven or</font>

53
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,670
eight but

54
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,140
we don't want all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that money going</font>

55
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,580
into government debt the answer is we're

56
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,319
never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to that two trillion</font>

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,319
dollar deficit because we can't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

58
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,930
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too big the markets won't fund</font>

59
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,170
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so some time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

60
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,410
when a year two years three years if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

61
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,890
don't show a credible plan to get back

62
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,690
to manageable debts the markets just

63
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to jerk our chain rates go up we</font>

64
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,269
have another crisis will if we haven't

65
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:44,590
fixed our too big to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fail banks will</font>

66
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,510
have banks too big to fail again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

67
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,600
you know will be forced to act

68
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,549
rationally we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hyper</font>

69
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,810
inflate goals not going to 50,000 but

70
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,000
we're gonna we could have a problem now

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,180
if on the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand we stand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up and say</font>

72
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,209
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is too much debt this is</font>

73
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,410
too much deficit we're going to have a

74
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,959
credible path and and pull a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number out</font>

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,850
of the air 150 billion a year we're

76
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,590
going to reduce the deficit by for the

77
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,170
next you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years and we're</font>

78
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,900
they're going to reduce it by growing or

79
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,470
by increasing taxes if you want to or by

80
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,230
actually cutting spending something that

81
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,570
you know is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see inconceivable</font>

82
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,470
but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do that otherwise the</font>

will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> forced into a crisis decision</font>

86
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,410
here it's not something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the elephant in the room for</font>

15 years no no we didn't you can't fund

89
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,310
15 trillion dollars in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next eight or</font>

90
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,500
nine years there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not out there I</font>

91
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean you can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find more than a hundred</font>

92

percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of GDP the world's going to give</font>

93
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,150
us about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 300 billion dollars a year</font>

94
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,350
that's what they're doing now because

95
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,690
that's what we're buying other stuff I

96
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,609
they turn around and conveniently put it
