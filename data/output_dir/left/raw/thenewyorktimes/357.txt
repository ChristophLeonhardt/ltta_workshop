1
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:20,080
The process you see is actually using
indigenous Mars materials or materials

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,309
available elsewhere in the
solar system combined

3
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:24,560
with materials that can be recycled

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,810
from what's already onboard a
spaceship, so that you can carry as

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,929
little weight with you to construct
a structure in space.

6
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,210
The big point of it all is
carrying weight into space is

7
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,039
extraordinarily expensive. I think the
figure used to be something like,

8
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,369
you know, $10 million a
pound. Because the fuel

9
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:45,409
that you'll need to burn to
actually get that into orbit

10
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:46,880
is just absolutely insane,

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,849
and the size of the spacecraft you
need to actually handle that.

12
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,509
The idea is to take as little
with you as possible,

13
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:55,358
and to use whatever is available
â€” whatever you're already taking

14
00:00:55,358 --> 00:00:58,448
with you in the form of the spacecraft â€”
and then whatever you can find.

15
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,909
We're using about 80 pounds
of material for that dome compared

16
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:10,989
to four or five hundred for
the concrete domes,

17
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:15,579
and yet achieve comparable strength
to a fully cured concrete mixture

18
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:18,518
without having to wait 30 days for
the cure, without having to deal

19
00:01:18,518 --> 00:01:22,538
with water, which is going to be very
difficult on a place like Mars

20
00:01:22,538 --> 00:01:25,637
where your daily surface temperature
could be as high as 70 degrees,

21
00:01:25,637 --> 00:00:00,000
but as low as negative
190 degrees Fahrenheit.
