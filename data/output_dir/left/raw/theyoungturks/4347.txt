1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,620
HEALTHCARE IS IN THE DUMPER.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,620
WHAT'S NEXT?

3
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,830
TAX REFORM IT SEEMS.

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,450
THERE
IS A PUSH NOW THAT HEALTHCARE

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,219
IS OUT-OF-THE-WAY TO FOCUS ON
ONE OF THE MAIN PROMISES OF

6
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:14,160
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WHICH
IS A TAX REFORM INITIATIVE.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,180
THERE IS A NEW EVENT, IN CASE
YOU WANT TO PUT ON YOUR

8
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,570
CALENDARS FOR MONDAY.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,000
IT IS
HOSTED BY THE KOCH BROTHERS

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,690
AND THEIR AFFILIATE
ORGANIZATIONS.

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,910
WHO'S THERE?

12
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,720
TREASURY SECRETARY
STEVEN MNUCHIN ACCORDING TO

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,720
GRAPHIC

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,480
16, STEVEN MNUCHIN AND
WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,730
LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS MARC SHORT
ARE SLATED TO SPEAK ON A PANEL

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,870
AT THE NEWSEUM EVENT,
ALONG WITH FREEDOM PARTNERS

17
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,910
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE EXECUTIVE
VICE PRESIDENT JAMES DAVIS

18
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,120
AND AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY
PRESIDENT TIM PHILLIPS.

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,829
FREEDOM PARTNERS AND AFP ARE
BOTH BACKED BY WEALTHY GOP

20
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,890
DONORS THE KOCH BROTHERS.

21
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,890
WHAT ARE THEY GOING AFTER?

22
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,050
THE KOCH NETWORK HAS COMMITTED
TO SPEND MILLIONS OF

23
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,480
DOLLARS ON ITS EFFORTS TO
CHAMPION TAX REFORM THAT

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,160
FOLLOWS FIVE PRINCIPLES:
SIMPLICITY, EFFICIENCY,

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,159
EQUITABILITY, PREDICTABILITY,
AND NO NEW BURDENS ON TAXPAYERS.

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:16,310
HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING.

27
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,670
THIS IS THE MAIN THING THAT
REPUBLICAN DONORS WANTED.

28
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,610
IN FACT, PAUL RYAN ADMITS THAT
THE WHOLE HEALTHCARE PLAN

29
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,320
WAS TO GET TAX CUTS FOR THE
RICH.

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,340
WE TOLD YOU THAT MONDAY.

31
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,280
TRUMP
LIKES TO PRETEND

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,610
THESE ARE HONORABLE GENTLEMEN
WITH IDEAS ON HOW TO

33
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,610
IMPROVE HEALTHCARE.

34
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,600
NO, PAUL RYAN EXPLAINED THAT
DOING SO, GETTING RID OF

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,420
OBAMACARE WOULD REMOVE THE LAW'S
RELATED TAXES AND ALLOW THE

36
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,770
GOP TO LOWER TAX RATES EVEN MORE
DRAMATICALLY.

37
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,790
THAT WAS WHY THEY WERE TRYING TO
GET RID OF OBAMACARE.

38
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,560
THEY FAILED THERE.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,899
NOW THEY'RE MOVING ON AND GOING
COME

40
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:56,979
ON, SCREW IT, WE'LL JUST GET THE
TAX CUTS BY THEMSELVES.

41
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:01,810
WE WERE HOPING TO DO
HEALTHCARE AND THEN THE GIANT

42
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,400
TAX CUTS, I GUESS WE WILL JUST
HAVE TO DO THE GIANT TAX CUTS.

43
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:13,500
PAUL RYAN HAD PROPOSED TO LEVEL
THE FIELD A LITTLE BIT MORE BY

44
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,830
DOING AN IMPORT TAX BASICALLY,
AND HE WAS SAYING, WE'RE GOING

45
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,330
TO CREATE A GIANT DEFICIT WHEN
WE CLAIM WE CARE ABOUT DEFICITS.

46
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,000
LET'S MAKE THAT GIANT DEFICIT
JUST A TINY BIT SMALLER BY

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,670
ALWAYS BRINGING IN SOME REVENUE
FROM AN IMPORT TAX AND THE

48
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,940
KOCH BROTHERS SAID NO.

49
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,190
WE IMPORT THINGS, I DON'T WANT
TO PAY THAT TAX.

50
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,190
WHAT

51
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,300
PART OF MY LEGALIZED BRIBE DID
YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,500
AND IT IS GONE.

53
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,310
NOW THERE IS NO CHECK, THERE IS
NO BALANCE, NO EXTRA REVENUE.

54
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,030
THIS IS A MULTI- TRILLION DOLLAR
GIVEAWAY TO THE RICH AND

55
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,530
THE CORPORATIONS.

56
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,210
THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA.

57
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,310
I WANT TO LAY IT OUT FOR YOU
GUYS.

58
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:58,650
THIS IS THE ONE THING PEOPLE
DEFINITELY PASS UNDER TRUMP, SO

59
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,060
TRUMP CAN FAIL AT EVERYTHING
UNDER THE MOON AND THE SKY, AND

60
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,180
HEALTHCARE THEY COULD'VE WON
ON, BUT THEY BUNGLED IT BECAUSE

61
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,980
THE RICH REALLY WANTED THAT TAX
CUT WITH THE REPEALING OF

62
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,490
OBAMACARE, BUT HE COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DEAL.

63
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,950
HE IS SO STUPID.

64
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,120
ANYWAY, FOR THE TAX CUTS THOUGH,
THERE IS NO NEGOTIATION HERE.

65
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,540
I TOLD YOU BEFORE THE SHOW, I
HAVE RECORDS FROM THE

66
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,400
DONORS WHO HAVE COME OUT FROM
BEHIND THE CURTAIN AND

67
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,870
SAID, I WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR.

68
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,740
THIS IS DO OR DIE.

69
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,470
YOU EITHER PASS THIS OR THEY
SAID, LITERALLY THERE WAS A

70
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,290
QUOTE SAYING, WE'RE GOING TO
TURN OFF THE PIGGY BANK.

71
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,470
REPUBLICANS, YOU MUST PASS THIS,
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS

72
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,470
WITH THEIR VOTERS.

73
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,420
YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO GET A
DIME FROM US AGAIN.

74
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,880
THE WHOLE POINT OF OUR LEGALIZED
BRIBES FOR YOU GUYS WAS TO

75
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,460
GET THIS IN RETURN.

76
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,460
AND THEY WILL.

77
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,450
NOT ONLY WILL THEY, I WILL
GO FURTHER WITH MY PREDICTION.

78
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,370
THEY WILL GET SOME DEMOCRATIC
VOTES TOO.

79
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,190
THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT ISN'T
NEARLY AS SENSATIONAL AS

80
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,190
HEALTHCARE.

81
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,550
IT DOESN'T AFFECT
PEOPLE IN THE IMMEDIATE LIKE

82
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,700
HEALTHCARE DOES, AND I HOPE WE
WILL SEE THE SAME AMOUNT OF

83
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,480
AMAZING RESISTANCE WITH THIS.

84
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
AS
MUCH AS WE

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,300
TALKED ABOUT MCCAIN, IT REALLY
IS OWED TO THE MOVEMENTS OF

86
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,650
THE PEOPLE WHO SAT IN, AND ALL
THE ORGANIZATIONS I KNOW

87
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,660
TYT COVERED AND TALKED
ABOUT, BUT THIS IS ONE THAT

88
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,020
IS HARDER TO RALLY AROUND.

89
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,020
ARE
YOU GOING TO CALL YOUR

90
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,579
SENATORS AND CONGRESSPEOPLE
ABOUT THIS?

91
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,720
WE SHOULD, BECAUSE THIS IS GOING
TO HIT US JUST AS HARD.

92
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,710
IT REQUIRES EASILY Ã±

93
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,950
HEALTHCARE, RIDICULOUSLY
COMPLICATED, BUT WAS ABLE

94
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,070
TO GET BOILED DOWN TO A FEW KEY
TERMS THAT EVERYONE COULD

95
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,400
IDENTIFY VERY EASILY, LIKE, 15
MILLION LOSE HEALTH INSURANCE.

96
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,960
30 MILLION LOSE HEALTH
INSURANCE.

97
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,940
PREMIUMS CHANGE THIS MUCH.

98
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,940
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.

99
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,840
THOSE ARE THE MARKERS THAT NEED
TO BE LAID OUT IMMEDIATELY

100
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,760
TO IDENTIFY WHAT IS OFF-LIMITS
THAT PEOPLE CAN REALLY

101
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,060
IDENTIFY WITH AND IT IS GOING TO
BE TOO BECAUSE ALL OF THIS

102
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,410
IS GOING TO BE PUT IN TERMS OF
THIS SAVES MILLIONS OF

103
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,410
DOLLARS FROM BUSINESSES.

104
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,470
I CAN
HIRE PEOPLE.

105
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,510
THEY WILL SAY

106
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,590
EVEN THOUGH, HE TALKED ABOUT
THIS IN THE SHOW YESTERDAY,

107
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,330
THAT TAX PLAN DOES NOT WORK.

108
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,270
WE HAD A GREAT EXAMPLE OF IT IN
KANSAS.

109
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,270
LOOK AS, BOTTOM

110
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,080
LINE IS, FRANCESCA AND BRETT ARE
EXACTLY RIGHT.

111
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,440
THIS IS A SLOW-MOTION ROBBERY
AND WHAT HAPPENS, YOU MIGHT

112
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,600
NOT SEE IT ON DAY ONE, BUT IT
ESTIMATES THE REST OF THE

113
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,350
BUDGET BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING
LEFT AND THEN REPUBLICANS

114
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,050
WILL TURN AROUND, AND YOU'VE
SEEN IT HAPPEN ON YOUR TV

115
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,000
FOR DECADES, WE DON'T HAVE ANY
MONEY.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,450
OH MY GOD, BERNIE SANDERS WANTS
TO DO FOR COLLEGE FOR YOUR

117
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,620
KIDS YOU CANNOT BE AMERICAN
DREAM?

118
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,690
SORRY, WE RAN OUT OF MONEY FOR
THE MIDDLE CLASS.

119
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,129
SORRY, WE RUN OUT OF MONEY FOR
YOUR HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION,

120
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:38,580
FOR ANYTHING THAT WAS ACTUALLY
GOING TO HELP YOUR FAMILY.

121
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,580
WHY?

122
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,130
THEY NEVER TELL YOU IT'S BECAUSE
OF THE TRILLION DOLLAR TAX

123
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,690
CUTS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO
PASS, AND THEY WILL.

124
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,520
UNFORTUNATELY, LOOK, YOU BITE
EVERY DAY AND WE WILL WE WILL

125
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,950
SEE THE REALITY OF IT AND WE
WILL PRESSURE YOUR CONGRESSMAN

126
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,910
AND SENATORS DIVIDED IF THEY
VOTE FOR IT, MAKE SURE YOU VOTE

127
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,350
THEM OUT OF OFFICE, BUT ON
THIS ONE, I DON'T KNOW WHEN

128
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,630
TRUMP LEAVES OFFICE AND I
DON'T KNOW IF HE WINS ON ANY

129
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,660
OTHER ISSUE, BUT ON THIS ISSUE,
HE IS VERY LIKELY TO WIN BECAUSE

130
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,380
THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE
DONORS GIVING ALL OF THIS MONEY.

131
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,970
THEY GAVE A COMBINED BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS IN DONATIONS AND

132
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,320
LOBBYIST MONEY BUT THE KID BACK
TRILLIONS IN TAX CUTS.

133
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,180
THEY'RE NOT STUPID, THEY'RE NOT
GIVING AWAY THAT MONEY FOR

134
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,410
THEIR OR YOUR HELP.

135
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,610
THERE GIVING IT FOR THEIR WELL
SO THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY

136
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,220
AND THIS IS HOW THEY GET THEIR
RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND

137
00:06:30,220 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WILL GET IT.
