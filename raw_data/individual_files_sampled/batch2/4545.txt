a large margin want to see the Muller probe continue its work now get these number 72 percent of registered voters believe that Robert Muller should be allowed to finish the investigation well only 11 percent one out of 10 believe you should be fired now breaking down those numbers really actually gets more interesting eighty-three percent of Democrats of course want the the probe to continue to the end seventy six of Independence want the probe to continue to the end and get this fifty-seven percent of Republicans believe that Robert Mahler should be allowed to finish his investigation and they're only twenty five percent of Republicans believe that he should be fired John Heilemann that is what the kids might call a sea-change where Republicans now we're starting to see the indictments of all the Russians starting to see all the indictments and all the cooperating witnesses from Donald Trump's own administration and we're starting to say okay well we don't know exactly whether the president's guilty or not but we want to see this play out to the end that certainly shows and we've seen this trend for some time that the public support of robert muller just continues to grow yeah and look i think that's a you know almost no one in our political life and then robert muller would say he's not part of our political life he's he's just doing his job as a as a prosecutor a lawyer but he is a he is maybe the most important political figure in the country now besides donald trump he there's no in our political life who has numbers like that you know eighty percent support among among democrats of is seventy five percent support among among independents and and norton seven points north of fifty percent among republicans so that's an extraordinary degree almost unprecedented american life where we see that in a polarized country you see that kind of support and his support is growing i think as people as you say Joe as more of the evidence comes down as more of the indictments are issued people want to know where this is going to lead and I think that one of the things that Muller is tapped into here is the sense that there are obviously partisans on both sides fierce loyalists to the president fierce critics of the president but for most Americans there's some degree of unease and and some the doubts have been raised questions in their mind right things they want to know about even if they still sort of root on some level they they don't want to see the country in crisis they don't want to see a constitutional breakdown they don't want to see an impeachment but they want to know the truth about what happened in 2016 and they want to have the questions that they have in their minds resolved and they're putting their faith in Muller in a very solid way to be the guy who will deliver them in the end the truth and the facts about that well and so some questions are obviously being raised about Donald Trump about Facebook if you look at the numbers Facebook's numbers are falling precipitously now we have Cambridge analytic coming in there I think Americans want to know the truth and at the end of the day Republicans and Democrats alike the majority of them actually believe that no man or woman is above the law so right now if you look at these numbers the merest numbers and compare them to other political figures other public figures in America it looks right now like Robert Muller if if he's not the most trusted man in America in American life he's one of the most trusted men in American life yeah Jo Jo Jo I'll just just quickly say if you're Donald Trump if we've all been talking about now for weeks if not months and you're thinking I want to fire this guy Bob Muller if you're Donald Trump and you're just being a purely political actor you looked at at those poll numbers and you recognized the political jeopardy that you would be in if you tried to make a very clear obvious move against Muller you realize the kind of political headwinds you'd be facing if you were Donald Trump coming up on Morning Joe our chief legal correspondent Ari Melba reacts to our interview with Michael avenatti the attorney for stormy Daniels we'll be right back with more Morning Joe thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
