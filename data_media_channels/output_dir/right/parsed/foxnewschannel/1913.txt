TODD: DONALD TRUMP GREETING
NEWLY FREED AMERICAN HOSTAGES
BACK TO THE US AFTER MONTHS OF
IMPRISONMENT IN NORTH KOREA.
IT HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE
MORNING.
HERE'S ASIA ANALYST AND AUTHOR
OF NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN, GORDON
CHANG.
NO ONE BETTER TO HAVE ONSET THIS
MORNING.
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS WHAT WE JUST
SAW?
>> IT IS EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT
LARGELY BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO
BE JUST WEEKS BEFORE OUR
PRESIDENT SITS DOWN WITH KIM
JONG UN.
THE FIRST TIME A SITTING NORTH
KOREAN LEADER AND SITTING
AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAVE GOTTEN
TOGETHER.
THE ISSUES ARE CONSEQUENTIAL.
YOU NOT ONLY HAVE THE NUKES BUT
BALLISTIC MISSILES, THE JAPANESE
-- MAYBE THERE IS A FOURTH
ALL SORTS OF THINGS WE HAVE GOT
TO TALK ABOUT.
TODD: WHAT DOES THIS PORTEND FOR
THE NUCLEAR DISCUSSION THAT WILL
HAPPEN IN SINGAPORE IN JUNE?
>> IT IS A GOOD SIGN BECAUSE
THESE THREE WERE IN GOOD HEALTH,
ABLE TO WALK ON THE PLANE BY
THEMSELVES, THIS IS IN CONTRAST
TO AUTO WARMBIER WHO WAS
RELEASED JUNE OF LAST YEAR, IN
EXTREMELY POOR CONDITION,
VEGETATIVE STATE, DIED SHORTLY
AFTER RETURNING TO THE US, THE
NORTH KOREANS DIDN'T LIKE US.
NOW THE NORTH KOREANS WANT TO
CREATE GOODWILL SO THEY KEPT
THESE GUYS IN GOOD CONDITION.
>> YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT --
WHAT KIM JONG UN IS WILLING TO
GIVE UP?
>> THE ONLY THING WE ARE WILLING
TO ACCEPT HIS COMPLETE
DISARMAMENT OF NORTH KOREA AND
THAT IS CRITICAL.
OUR ALLIES DEPENDS ON IT, AND IT
DEPENDS ON DISARMING NORTH
KOREA.
THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF WHAT
KIM ONE TOS.
SHORT OF USE OF FORCE TO DISARM
THE NORTH KOREANS, WHETHER THEY
WERE WILLING TO DO THOSE THINGS.
AND HE THINKS KIM JONG UN WANTS
TO ENTER THE REAL WORLD.
>> HE WANTED TO ENTER THE REAL
WORLD WITH HIS NUKES.
WE CAN TIGHTEN THE SANCTIONS ON
NORTH KOREA, WE CAN GO AFTER
THEIR MAJOR POWER BACKERS,
RUSSIA AND CHINA WHO ARE
SUPPORTING NORTH KOREA TO
VARYING DEGREES.
YOU GO BACK TWO MONTH, CHINA HAS
MARKEDLY DETERIORATED.
THESE ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO.
THAT DOESN'T MATTER IF NORTH
KOREA GIVES UP ITS NUKES BUT IF
IT DOESN'T WE HAVE TO PUSH THE
CHINESE AROUND.
>> A FOURTH DETAINEE GOT LOST IN
ALL THE EXCITING NEWS AND OF
COURSE THE AUTO WARMBIER
SITUATION.
TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT.
>> IN 2004 IN MYSTERIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CHINESE
POLICE REPORTS ARE OBVIOUS
FABRICATIONS, AND HE TAUGHT
ENGLISH TO KIM JONG UN.
THERE IS ONE REPORT OF DAVID
STEDMAN BEING CITED IN NORTH
KOREA, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW.
BUT A CONFIRMATION FROM THE
NORTH KOREA, AND THIS IS JUST
LIKE THE JAPANESE TAKEN BY NORTH
KOREA FOR LANGUAGE OBSTRUCTION.
>> DOES THIS GUM UP THE WORKS ON
THE JUNE SUMMIT?
>> IT IS SOMETHING WE CAN
FORGET.
THIS IS ANOTHER AMERICAN WHO MAY
