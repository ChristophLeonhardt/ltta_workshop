00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,319
hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so although I've talked</font>

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:02,429
about this before it's something that

3
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:03,990
people always always ask me to talk

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,609
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's something</font>

5
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,379
that people just constantly revisit in

6
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,970
their life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's reading way</font>

7
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,410
treating yourself to read making the

8
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,509
time to read and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people ask me how</font>

9
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,490
I find that time to read my old answer

10
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,379
my stable<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer was you just have to</font>

11
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,740
make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you just have to just make</font>

12
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,570
time in reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> this over simplifies</font>

13
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,920
things and to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a lot</font>

14
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,449
easier making time to read when I was

15
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,310
still a student but as now for whatever

16
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,380
reason I really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have to</font>

17
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,939
make the time like I have to structure

18
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,729
it into my day I<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely romanticize</font>

19
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,250
my nature with books for me it exists on

20
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,469
another plane and my desire<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read is</font>

21
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,600
tied into that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> every now and</font>

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,250
then I do catch myself saying what I've

23
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,350
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been so busy tears don't have time</font>

24
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,180
to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that I love and that's</font>

25
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yes it would be okay if I were</font>

26
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,620
being honest with myself is in reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

27
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,480
know that i might have spent my evening

28
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,309
in a less productive way laying out

29
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,199
favorite lines from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hills but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,730
that's the whole thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought you're</font>

31
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,649
making an effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Spencer and Athena</font>

32
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,059
but then he pulled stuff like you did

33
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,219
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> night he's a sucky person he's a</font>

34
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,860
sucky person Lauren I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like Spencer</font>

35
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,420
I'm never like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so that was a really</font>

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">messed up thing he did last night it</font>

37
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,479
seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of you probably</font>

38
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,280
do this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well like he's found at a</font>

39
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,290
time on tumblr or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend your time on</font>

40
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,210
top of it saying that you hate tumblr

41
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,560
where you spend a little bit too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

42
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,900
time categorizing your emails by labels

43
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,850
and label color or instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reading</font>

44
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,530
when your break<font color="#E5E5E5"> you stare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the abyss</font>

49
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that romanticizing our</font>

50
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,799
relationships with books can harm us

51
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,659
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than help us the experience once</font>

52
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,130

54
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,729
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> will give ourselves enough</font>

55
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,590
credit for the physical decision to pick

56

<font color="#E5E5E5">lie to ourselves and say that we didn't</font>

time to read that's not an abstract

thing or lofty thing or<font color="#E5E5E5"> romanticized</font>

68
