hello I am jello and I was hyperbole
there was this
I think study period our teacher decided
not to teach us during that time and
give us free cut for us to study and as
I was studying people began laughing at
my back later on that night in our
Facebook group someone began uploading
photos well at first it was nothing out
of ordinary selfish portraits and this
one photo that stood out
it's a photo of vodka it was then that I
realized that it was mine and the people
at my back took that photo during the
study period it was very very
embarrassed before maybe for some people
it was funny but for me it's not then
comments began appearing like seeing a
bottle
Kadir in a man you piggy bank something
like that well the next day was worse
someone printed out the photo of my butt
crack and stuck it in the chair
I don't know what to do I froze all I
remember was people were laughing at me
they were all looking at me and then I
went back home that they then opened my
facebook and lo and behold they already
made my photo the photo of a crack as
the cover of our Facebook group
I was really frustrated they don't know
what to do I remember crying I was
helpless
straighted that was depressed no I was
never able to resolve it
I was embarrassed I was helpless can't
even tell my parents and teachers I
wasn't able to change the way people
look at me but I was able to change the
way I look at myself I learned how to
love myself more and by that I was able
to love the people around me better
you
