1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:06,970
Personal data doesn’t get much more personal
than this- that’s your DNA.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,500
Consumer testing companies promise that in
exchange for a vial of spit and a fee, they’ll

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,230
reveal your heritage and clues to your health.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:19,070
Called direct-to-consumer genetic testing,
the industry has grown in popularity- sales

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,700
are projected to triple in the next five years.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,040
But watch out.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,090
After the test is done, those companies still
have your genetic data, and there are few

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,040
limits to what they can do with it.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,050
If you read the privacy and the terms of use
policies for any of these genetic testing

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,860
companies, they actually outline for you very
clearly all the reasons you might want to

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,350
really think hard before you participate in
them// Recently 23andMe struck a deal with

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,620
GlaxoSmithKline to provide them data to develop
drugs// that is a huge part of the business.

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,210
These agreements, which consumers must sign,
also say the companies may have to share data

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,860
with law enforcement if compelled by a court
order.

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:07,440
They haven’t yet complied with any requests,
but they may not need to: Police in Sacramento

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,940
County, California, believe they cracked the
long-cold case of the Golden State Killer

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,860
by matching DNA from a crime scene to one
of his relatives through an open-source genealogy

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,860
website.

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,820
In 2008, Congress passed GINA - or The Genetic
Information Nondiscrimination Act -- which

20
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,750
is meant to bar employers and health insurers
from using people’s genetic information

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,750
against them.

22
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,590
But there are some loopholes in that law.

23
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,390
For example, life insurers could use your
genetic information to decide whether to offer

24
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,850
you a policy or not.

25
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,950
But at least the products do what they advertise,
right?

26
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,840
Welllllll, yes and no.

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,729
Brown: One thing that they can definitely
100 percent tell you, is other people that

28
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:50,990
you're closely related to// But after that
you get declining accuracy for basically every

29
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,520
other application of genetic testing

30
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,340
For example, breast cancer.

31
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,440
You get a test result back that says you're
negative for one kind of breast cancer, but,

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,670
maybe you are at risk for other kinds of breast
cancers, cause there's thousands of markers

33
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,890
for these conditions and they're not all well
understood.

34
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,288
Some consumer DNA companies also claim to
be able to give you further health insights.

35
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:17,139
The science is just not there in those roles
to effectively say how you should be exercising

36
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:22,249
or eating or what skin care products you should
be using based on your DNA.

37
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:26,819
Even if you decide a DNA test isn’t for
you, you might want to convince your relatives,

38
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,019
as well: Their DNA could inadvertently reveal
a lot about you, too..

39
00:02:31,019 --> 00:00:00,000
So remember before spitting into that tube:
It’s not just personal, it’s familial.
