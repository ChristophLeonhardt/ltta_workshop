kim jeong-hoon has offered donald trump and an invitation to meet and in that invitation he also indicated that he will halt all nuclear missile testing now this is an interesting development we do know that South Korea and North Korea have been engaged in diplomatic talks and that happened prior to the Olympics and I guess those talks have continued but this is a good sign however I I feel skeptical about all of this we'll see how this all turns out apparently Trump made the announcement and his staff was caught off guard which which is typical Trump fashion exactly like they're probably know wait wait hold on we should think about what our responsive up their egos okay now should Trump pull a Rodman and go to hook then he's not gonna go to North Korea but should they actually meet I don't know look I I don't there's there's two different sides here one is I don't trust anything the North Koreans say they're trumpian they they say one thing the next day they say the next and it's all a bunch of stupid games and it's really annoying and and they're not remotely trust where the North Korean government obviously on the other hand I believe in talking to your enemies so the preposterous idea of and and neo-cons always said this and they still say it about Iran we shouldn't talk to our enemies well okay but we could talk to our friends all day long that's not gonna help resolve any conflict that's right or do herself accompli got it our dear enemy so I yeah I guess I would say do it but with a lot of reservations and safeguards in place well the thing that concerns me is that we're talking about Trump and he's not he's the type of person who admittedly is not interested in national security briefings or briefings in general and so he doesn't strike me as someone who is knowledgeable on the nuances of this very important foreign policy issue but with that said I do think that this is a considerable step up from what he was doing before which was tweeting juvenile tweets and making fun of Kim Jong Un's wait yeah I want to feel calm man to his face but you know I actually Anna I hadn't thought about it that way and that is a counterpoint to meeting because if the North Koreans are savvy all they'd have to do bees Oh mr. Trump we did not realize how stunningly handsome you are in person that's exactly what I mean I I feel like Trump softens toward people who say nice things to him who complement him who boost his ego and Kim jong-un is a terrible person but he strikes me as a little smarter than Trump but that's a really low bar a super low bar and so if they come in and go mr. president your hands are awfully large he might continue with that nuclear testing big beautiful nuclear tests he might literally come and go look on the nuclear testing he denied it he strongly denied it right and so I think there's some good people there's some bad people there but there's some good people in the North Korean government I mean they've got some bad concentration camps and I've got some good concentration camps so you know what actually a lot of the rest of the world might be missing an opportunity here it is actually incredibly easy to look Donald Trump right and so even with the issue of Israel for instance and building the settlements so one day he's 100% pro-israel I'm gonna name Jerusalem the capital of Israel boom it's done and then the next day he'll criticize Netanyahu over the settlements yeah and so he it really depends on who he's communicating with on any given day or in any given hour or any mood that he has and you he could if he was smart he could use that as a negotiation strategy he has no strategy so Israel bare government it led by Netanyahu apparently is very corrupt unsurprising he's terribly right-wing got no interest in him but he is a savvy guys nobody thinks he's stupid and so he does the smart thing which unfortunately a lot of countries could do if they had bad intent in negotiating with us whenever Trump says something that Netanyahu likes oh you want to move the embassy he'll done thank you all right and he says something they don't like you should get rid of the settlements sueda man wait till tomorrow and he'll forget about it and then whenever he says something you're like I'll take it okay so I hope the North Koreans don't do that to them but at a bare minimum at least we're talking and it's an interesting offer if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
