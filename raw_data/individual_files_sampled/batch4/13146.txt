today's opening monologue has been redacted by the Justice Department with blanks left where words were edited out many Americans are beginning to feel that the Obama administration is not being honest about the threat to Americans posed by blank a perception has grown up that any link between terrorism and blank or violence and blank or the mistreatment of women and blank is being hidden from the public possibly the administration feels that by not mentioning blank when there's an act of blank terrorism it can keep the public from thinking about blank or connecting the dots between a rising tide of worldwide chaos and blank whenever a terrorist shouts blank blank before setting off a suicide bomb or swears allegiance to blank or says that there is no god but blank and blank is his prophet before spraying a room of innocent people with bullets the administration edits out the references to blank and immediately tries to reassure people that there's no more violence caused by blank than there is by Christianity after all as President Obama and Hillary Clinton have repeatedly told us it's guns that cause violence and just the fact that the guns are so often in the hands of a blank there's no more reason to condemn blank then there is to point out that many hateful people are Christians are Republicans or Christian Republicans or conservative Christians or conservative Christian Republicans who go around spreading bigotry against blank like the hate-filled conservative Christian Republicans they are we here at the Andrew Clavin show however feel that the administration's position doesn't make sense we can't help noticing that wherever a decisive number of blanks profess faith in blank and his prophet blank as taught in the blank they always blank things up and turn everything to blanking blank in fact some of these blanking blanks might ask themselves if blank in his blank in the blank are really the hot blank these blanking blanks with their blanking blanks think they are and another thing why is it all right to link Republicans or Christians or conservatives to violence which they almost never commit but the black won't mention the blanks who plank up every blanking thing they touch now of course we don't want to condemn all blanks and we suppose we should blither the blah blah blah blather about blank blank and blank but these blank blank the blank every time a blank goes blank and the blah blah blah about the blank blank blank seems like a lot of blank in the end we feel that the administration is dishonest misrepresentation of blank only serves to make people even more suspicious of blanks and may even stoke fears that Obama and his cronies are themselves a bunch of blanks not to mention Muslims just barely just question its mailbag mailbag day we really do and so you should subscribe so you can be in next week's mailbag day because you already clinging to your lousy you've already missed the chance to be in today's mailbag day but we do have a question about breaking up during the monologue so address that important issue so we're gonna talk about brexit not just not just brexit from the british points of view because who cares you know every time I see my lowly innopolis and that other guy that appear what's his name yeah didn't we fight a war to keep you guys everything country you telling telling is what we should be doing so I don't want to tell the British what they should be doing I want to talk about this as it relates to us brexit of course is a portmanteau word we all know what a portmanteau word is right well let's just talk about importance brexit a portmanteau is a kind of suitcase that opens into two pieces so a portmanteau word is a word that's been smooshed together from two words like brunch is breakfast it's two two is not that much matter so so brunch is a portmanteau a word right because it's breakfast and lunch motel and Motor Hotel is a portmanteau my favorite my personal favorite portmanteau word is gerrymander which comes from a guy named Jerry you divided up the congressional districts in such a twisty way to keep all his people in it that it looked like a salamander so a gerrymander that's okay so this is Britain and exit they want to exit the EU and the reason this comes up is because in a desperate reelection campaign in 2015 the Prime Minister David Cameron promised his disaffected conservative base who wanted to get out of the European Union's he promised them an up-and-down vote on whether they could stay and and this is pretty shocking because it really is like a Texan it's like if Texas had a vote on whether to leave the this Union you know so it's very although obviously this union is has only been something that's come up after the war and it's much more modern but still there's a very there's a lot of similarity the EU Britain Britain has some certain outs certain ways that they're not part of the EU that kept the pound they still have some control over their borders but the EU is this massive bureaucratic institution they elect their Parliament that the Parliament is really the tools of the bureaucracy and this bureaucracy is churning out laws that the British are supposed to follow that everybody's supposed to follow that law has come out of Brussels but everybody's supposed to follow them and one of the big complaints about the that the British have is that the British of people who follow rules so when Brussels sends laws to attack to Italy that's like the laughs you know I haven't had a government since Caesar got murdered on the fire it's a little cold tonight but the British you know like you tell them that your potato chips have to have this much salt in it and so help me that those are the kinds of laws that come down from the EU you know they had they had it one of them was about the curve and a banana you know like the British and the British will like melt down their bananas dannaker kill the British follow the rules and so this is one of the things it's very it's very you it's a knob it's a knee a burden on the British that it's not on other people it's also economically it doesn't make a lot of sense in a lot of ways because when you make everybody's currency the same that means the Germans who work like dogs you know and they work and they're businessmen and they're you know have a lot of you know they have a lot of industry and all this stuff their money is worth the same as the Greeks who again you know since this just came home from Troy they haven't worked a full eight hours a day no I think and they're going and they're striking because they're not getting charity they're not getting entitlements so it's it's really a so it's a really weird Union because they are even more different from one another than we are I mean the Italians and the British are a lot more different even than Texans and New Yorkers who are very different also so it's very much like some of the stuff that's going on here so let's listen here's Cameron he's trying to keep people in the Union let's hear his argument Brits don't quit we get involved we take a lead we make a difference we get things done if we left if we left our neighbours would go on meeting and making decisions that profoundly affect us affect our country affect our jobs but we wouldn't be there they would be making decisions about us but without us I know Europe isn't perfect believe me I understand and I see those frustrations I feel them myself that's why we negotiated and enhanced our special status out of the euro keeping our borders not involved in ever closer Union we have the best of both worlds so as you take this decision whether to remain or leave do think about the hopes and dreams of your children and grandchildren they know their chances to work to travel to build the sort of open and successful society they want to live in rests on this outcome if I felt that remaining in the European Union diminished us I would recommend that we voted to leave but it doesn't it amplifies our power when were in these organizations we become an even bigger force in the world with a bigger influence in the world so two things that you noticed he said that they had opted out of the European Union's moved to become ever closer this is a move with in Brussels that is very unpopular in Britain but it's really unpopular in a lot of places throughout Europe to to essentially become one country to essentially become the United States of Europe but Britain is kind of holding back from that and has been holding back and the other thing you heard him do was appeal to people about their children and their grandchildren and the reason for that is because young people in Britain think of themselves as European so the young people the polls on this are completely the vote is from tomorrow and the polls have them divided 47 percent to 47 percent and the polls in Britain are classically unreliable they had Cameron losing the last election and there you see there he is and and you know I personally feel there's always a lot more power to inertia to stayin put and they're trying to panic people and tell them that the economy is gonna tank but what he is he's talking to people about their children and grandchildren because the young people basically this is all they've ever known they all they've known as themselves as part of Europe it's the older people who were saying gee England is in England anymore and if you go to London now you don't hear a British accent you if you're in the center of London you do not hear a British accent you have to start getting out to the outskirts and then you start to get into the where the English are and so people are just disturbed by that they feel they're they're losing the nature of their country which they love and the younger people are much more cosmopolitan much more worldly so that's why is it feel so here's Dan Hannon now we love then Hannah and he's our conservative guy over there you hear him on Hannity a lot and all this like I met him on the NRO cruise very very intelligent fellow I like him because he quote Shakespeare all the time but Hannon is a European MP who is against the EU so he made this ad hello I'm Daniel Hannan Conservative member of the European Parliament and I'm inviting you to fire me on the 23rd of June for five reasons first because leaving is the modern choice the European Union is a relic of the 1950s a leftover from an era when regional bloc's looked like the future but that world has been overtaken by technological change second because it's the cheaper choice instead of handing Brussels twenty billion pounds a year gross ten billion net will have our money to spend on our priorities third it's the Democratic choice we will take back the sublime right to hire and fire our own lawmakers fourth it's the safer choice in a necessarily uncertain world we will have taken back control to mitigate any risks ourselves instead of passing power to people who may not have our interests at heart and fifth because it's their confident choice we are a merchant maritime global nation the fifth largest economy on the planet the fourth military power one of five permanent seat holders on the UN Security Council we have the world's most widely studied language the world's greatest city how much bigger do we have to be before we're able to run our own affairs in our own interests trading and cooperating with friends and allies on every continent including Europe then living under our own laws now you'll notice it looks a little different than an American commercial like you know which is like you know Hillary Clinton's going to kill everybody drop is the worst present you know they actually come out and reason with people and they really do their politics is a lot more civilized a lot more articulate than ours so you hear the arguments he's making the obvious arguments we want control of our own country we can still be great that's very important to the British the British lost their empire within living memory you know so they actually don't it's not like when you go to Amsterdam and they had an empire once they could care less they they just think that they are still the moral center of the universe but the British the British myst's that kind of importance is they're all linked to us everything is linked to us they're very sensitive about our president coming in and bullying their you know p.m. and all this so he's saying we can still be a powerful nation without linking ourselves dear and control ourselves now there this every now and again I want to come in and say something and just before I'm about to somebody writes a column that says exactly what I was going to say and it's always Jonah Goldberg and I've I've yelled at him about this I told him to stop but somehow it's like but he makes the point that I was going to make that they are having you know I'm always very slow to tell other countries to express opinions about what other countries should do and the reason for that is I've lived in Britain I've lived overseas and until you live someplace you do not know that place at all when you hear Bernie Sanders talking about scan the net he doesn't know jack about those countries you don't know how they work he doesn't know what's failed there he doesn't know what they're arguing about he just sees like some looks like universal health care so we should have that here and it all works because they're all nice white people with yellow hair so everything is great you know and that's that's really the way people are thinking about other countries but you know personally I have an instinctive feeling that Britain should get out Britain has exempted itself from the foibles of Europe throughout its history you know they didn't have the Inquisition while the rest of Europe had the Inquisition they didn't get involved in the 30 Years War this bloody war that just completely it was mostly fought in Germany but all every country in Europe was killing everybody else in Germany and the British just stayed out of that you know they didn't have the French Revolution they stayed non revolutionary and developed toward freedom and a much more majestic and quiet and slowly paced way and they of course didn't have Hitler they alone while the French were going like it's another because you can choose what a good idea you know British the British were like yeah you know come and get us you know so they where they have stood up in in many many ways and my instinct is they should do that again now but of course it's something for them to decide but the thing is they're having the exact same problem with Brussels that we are having with Washington and here is the way that Jonah Goldberg puts it he says for generations American elites particularly on the left side of the aisle have insisted that democracy gets in the way of optimal decision-making what they what they like is they like expert you know Jonah goes on to quote Democrats for since FDR who basically say our problems are now too complex for the people to solve we need experts and you remember Obama once said if I could just sit down you know for a few hours with the experts we could solve all the problems but unfortunately we have to go through the Constitution and that's so he he says this attitude this love of expertise virtually defines the Obama administration's approach to everything from climate change it was the Environmental Protection Agency not Congress that destroyed the coal agency to immigration even President Obama admitted his executive orders would be unconstitutional then went through with them anyway Hillary Clinton's disdain for the rules regarding her server and email whether criminal or not have the distinct stench of aloof aristocratic arrogance as does her family's foundation the thing about the rule of unaccountable rulers is that people will defer to them so long as they feel things are moving in the right direction economically and otherwise but when their incompetence and self dealing seems to come at the expense of the public the deference ends see the problem with rule by experts is that experts don't know anything this is really the problem an expert telling you how you should you know make your bananas how you should run your garage doesn't know what you know there's a wonderful movie ever seen back to school with Rodney Dangerfield and back to school Rodney Dangerfield is a businessman a rich businessman who goes back to school because his son is having problems it goes back to college and here's a scene where the expert in college was never started a business never done anything is explaining to the class how you start a business and Dangerfield interrupts him just the material and construction costs was also the architects fees and the costs of land servicing oh you left out a bunch of stuff oh really like what for instance well first of all you're gonna have to grease the local politicians for the sudden zoning problems that always come up that is the kickback to the carpenters and if you plan on using any cement this building's I'm sure the Teamsters like have a little chat with you and that will cost you oh and I've got a little something for the building inspectors then there's a long term course such as waste disposal I don't know if you're familiar with who runs that business but I assure you it's not the Boy Scouts that'll be quite enough mr. melon maybe bribes and kickbacks and mafia payoffs are how you do business but they are not part of the legitimate business world and they're certainly not part of anything I am teaching in this class do I make myself clear sorry just trying to help you got to pay off the mob if you want if you want the construction stuff so you know yesterday Hillary Clinton launched her big attack on Trump for his business failures and one of her funny lines plays Hillary - the second Hillary Clinton I think Donald Trump has said he's qualified to be President because of his business record a few days ago he said and I quote I'm going to do for the country what I did for my business so let's take a look at what he did for his business he's written a lot of books about business they all seem to end at chapter 11 hey you know good line I guess for a politician but the but the thing is you know in business you fail in business failing is part of your success you fail because you try things out on the public and the public doesn't like me and you change true in show business you make a movie the public doesn't show up you make a different movie you change the things that you do in government you never are held accountable you know you can turn Libya into a flaming mess and you're still Secretary of State you can you can leave people to die in Benghazi and then come back and lie about it and as long as you can keep lying as long as you can keep convincing people to vote for you you never are held to account so a businessman is held to account yesterday not yesterday was Monday that hacker goose' 42.0 released some documents that he had gotten from the DNC where they were assessing what they called Clinton Foundation vulnerabilities things that Clinton may be hit on and these are not new things these have all been put out in that book Clinton cash in other words just let me read I'm just gonna read a list that was in Breitbart the Clinton Foundation received donations from individuals tied to Saudi Arabia while Clinton served as Secretary of State Indian politician amar Singh who had donated at least one millions of the Clinton Foundation met with Hillary Clinton in September 2008 to discuss an India u.s. civil nuclear agreement billionaire steel executive and members of the Foreign Investment Council on Kazakhstan Lakshmi Mittal gave 1 million dollars to five million dollars to the Clinton Foundation before Clinton became Secretary of State soon after Secretary Clinton left the State Department the Clinton Foundation received a large donation from a conglomerate run by a member of China's National People's Congress on and on and on and on so you know this is this is like an unaccountable woman this is a woman who does not hold herself to account and of course we just saw from the Federal Election Commission Trump is basically paying himself to run for president so he's you know his record is not that good either our ruling class for lack of a better phrase our ruling class has failed us they have failed us utterly and we in our desperation to bring in outsiders have according to the irony of God brought in the two dirtiest insiders we could have thought of and Trump versus Hillary and that's the thing so we should be thinking too the way the British are thinking maybe it's time for a new federalism which is really what I would like to talk more and more about as this show goes on we need a rebirth of federalism at every level political economic and moral we need to refashion our look or localities our churches our towns our states in in defiance of Washington and recreate the America we want in our hometowns alright we'll talk more about that as the time goes on it's time for the mailbag all right first question from David my wife and I loved your episode 140 intro monologue that's the one about good and evil and men and women that was pretty funny did you do it in one take if not are there any outtakes that you could share with your viewers we don't have outtakes but let me let me tell you that for about a week I could not get through a monologue in one take and we're still taping we haven't gone live yet and it's so it's important that I get it down but and the problem was this really was the problem they shifted the lights so suddenly we're before everybody was back there in the dark I couldn't see them but now I can see them so I've kind of adjusted until today when I blew I'm just gonna have to fight my way through because we will be going live eventually pretty soon I think in the next couple of weeks and so there's nothing I can do that one I did get through in one because I just I just adjusted my mind to the fact that I could see everybody before they were all in darkness so if they didn't laugh out loud they didn't crack me up but when I could see them I could see them kind of trying not to laugh and in program alright from Alisha I'm sorry from Dane I'll get to Alisha from Dane I'm currently reading your book werewolf cop I love it oh thanks although I was curious did you base any of the characters on people from reality I couldn't help but notice that at the beginning of the book your description of the police chief seemed to resemble Hillary Clinton was that on purpose or am i nuts well hopefully you're not nuts I can't answer that part of the question but no it wasn't based on Hillary Clinton the way I build characters is i-i've seen a lot of characters I know the kinds of people that they are I create them and then I take a little bit from somebody I know or maybe a couple of people I know and use it as 11 the same way you put yeast into bread and that brings them to life but sometimes the person I'm using is totally different than the person you see and if you write a character who looks like somebody they think it's them but a lot of times it just looks like them but it's actually got somebody else in their heart so I use a little bit of real people but not so much from from TV I use people that I've met and experience in life and certainly it wasn't Hillary Clinton from Alisha why is America two-party system wouldn't Americans benefit from having more candidates to choose from not in my opinion the two-party system for all it is a tremendous pain in the neck it keeps radicalism at bay you know basically the country is divided into two halves people who want to leave other people alone and people who don't and those are our two parties we have the Democrats want to tell everybody what to do and we have the Republicans who pretty much want more federalism and more freedom and insofar as those parties represent that I think that's the right way to go because a lot of this out you know when you have more and more parties they tend to represent smaller and smaller niches smaller and smarter smaller segments of the population more and more radical ideas and while yes every now and again a revolutionary idea comes along that is salvific that saves you most revolutionary rights yes are very very bad and most revolutions go very very wrong John we love your podcast keep up the good work my friend and I are dying to know what your wife thinks about your podcast remarks on feminism I'm not gonna answer that question because my wife is a tremendously private personally all know my wife here she is a a lovely elegant person you can listen we we have had you actually I hope you get my memoir my memoir is called the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ you can pre-order now it won't come till September but it is virtually a love letter to my wife it describes our marriage in detail and what it is about our marriage that is really spectacular Occulus it really is an amazing marriage and you can imagine just from listening to the show that anybody who is an amazing marriage with me must be an incredibly patient person so as much as I can say because she really likes to be left out of my public life and I don't blame her and I don't want to drag her into it if if I can help it all right from Rebecca how far should Christians take the command of Judge not oh man I love this that this question I could talk for hours on this question it seems to me the Christians these days have abandoned all discernment in favor of accepting all sin for fear of being called unloving the Bible states that darkness will hate the light but we want to appear dark so as not to offend the dark where is the correct balance between loving and discerning that is a great question and a deep question and I obviously can't answer it deeply right this minute but let me tell you this Jesus meant it when he said judge not lest you be judged and the way you can tell Jesus meant it it is the one thing he said that everybody tries to get out of every Christian tries to get out of Jesus never said a word about homosexuality I'm not arguing that he approved of homosexuality all I'm saying is that he never said a word about it yet everybody seems to know exactly what he thought and exactly what he meant on that issue but he said judge not lest you be judged half a dozen times he said let he was without sin throw the first stone meaning nobody he said don't look in the speck in somebody else else's eye look at the plank in your own eye and yet everybody when they hear that suddenly turns into a lawyer you know everybody's looking for a loophole on the judge not and all I can tell you is this that first of all you know to understand what Jesus means you have to know him you have to get to know one same thing with me when I talk about feminism and I make jokes about women and never get attacked by feminists oddly enough and the reason is it's very obvious that my respect for women runs deep and that I consider them half the world and their viewpoint half the world they have taken care of me since I've been an adult women have taken care of me and run my life since I've been an adult so so everybody who knows me knows that I'm not saying anything anti women and the same thing is true with Jesus you have to know him to understand what he's saying he's obviously not saying that you should forgive crime that you should look at a society that oppresses women or you know commits acts of violence and say oh well it's just as good as our society judge not do you know just you know obviously we judge crime because it's something that happens between man and man the things that happen between man and man we are perfectly capable of judging the things that happen between man and God we have no capability of judging we have no capability of looking at a person and I'm talking in the extreme you know even if he's evil we have no capability of knowing with the state of this soul with God we just don't know it and so we should just keep our opinion to ourselves and turn to the state of our own soil if you are in a church and you look around you what you will see every single face that you see every single person that you see is full of anxiety is full of guilt is full of sin they have done things in their lives and think things every day that they are so ashamed of so ashamed of that they can't even face their shame they've actually reconstructed their entire moral universe to hide their shame from themselves when you realize that it's all those people but you suddenly realize is it's you - and the question you should be asking is how are you're doing that you know how are you how are you modifying your moral world to keep from facing your own shame and that's what Jesus is talking about look you know you can have all the opinions you want I've worked on a lot of hotlines suicide hotlines and people call in and they say they've done terrible things and they say they are terrible things I mean things like people call and say they're Satanists you know and if do you think it helps them do you think it saves them do you think it keeps them alive to say like ooh Satanism that's wrong I know lucky we we both know we all know what Satanism is we know it's there but that's not what they're looking for what they're looking for is love and and if that if you're going to help them it's going to be by loving them and taking them in and accepting through them and seen to them and if that's not gonna work nothing's gonna work if that's not gonna save them nothing's gonna save them all I will follow end with this I will end with this when Jesus tells you something hard like judge not because it's really hard all I can tell you is if you tried more you do it the more joyous you become the more you leave people to their lives the more joyous you become the more less you worry about what how other what other people are doing in their bedrooms how other people are eating how they're drinking what they're thinking the happier you will become and you only have to look at the left and how miserable they've made themselves trying to tell everybody what they should eat what they should think who they should love what they should what their opinion should be who they should serve in their restaurants then look how how miserable they make themselves to know that if you let go if you let go of other people's lives and stop trying to coerce them to be good you will become more joyous and and more wise as well so anyway it's not to tell you not to have opinions it's not to tell you not to judge the actions of one person to another it is to tell you that you are not the judge of people God has got that and you've got to trust him to have it do you out of time there were a couple of really great questions maybe we'll come back to him next week don't lose them I like you know I've been talking I'm kind of out of time but stuff I like I wanted to talk about this book house of leaves and I'm not recommending house of leaves it's by a guy named Mark Danielewski it's a ghost story it's really big and it's really really difficult read it's a very difficult read it's a postmodern book it's about a guy who finds an academic study of a movie that may or may not exist okay and the movie is about a family in a haunted house and so it's all these college professors speaking in this College speak this academic speak about this haunted house about this movie about this once it happens and the reason I love this book it was I found it really entertaining but it is a very it's an intellectual exercise it's not like a big emotional book but the thing I loved about it is that the heart of this story is just a love story between a brave man and a loving woman it is a man who has the courage to walk into the darkness and a woman who has the love to follow him and help him out you know and that and and what the book sort of says is that everything we talk about everything we talk about all the academics all the nonsense all the politics everything at the center of it is that at the center of that is at the center of our lives is whether a man is brave enough to do what has to be done and whether a woman loves him enough to do what she has to do as well and when I talk about the logic of stories you know some one of the questions that came in that I didn't get a chance to answer was why don't I do stuff I hate like if the question comes from Benz or maybe it's from Shapiro but it says why don't you do things I hate segments and the reason is there are no things I hate I don't hate works of art some of them I think are bad I think they don't do what they're supposed to do but they don't bother me they don't even bother me if they're selling leftism because I realized that just as God will speak to the sinner in us and stories will speak to the heart in truth even if people try to lie if people try to lie the story will fall apart if the story reaches people it will reach them in truth even if the artist was trying to sell propaganda and lie so I don't you know I forget stories that don't work and I love the stories of the do work and I just have no great list of things that I don't like I would do the mailbag every day but I'm not allowed so so so please subscribe so you can be part of the mailbag ask some questions we will end the week my gosh this week just flew by it's already time for the Cleveland this weekend so that sounds bad for Britain I think you know we'll hope they survive I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show come back tomorrow and we will wrap the week up
