1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
“Wind back the clock.”

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,680
“Wind back the clock.
Until you get

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,370
a universe born from
a black hole exploding.”

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,270
“We learn to listen.”

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,110
Stephen Hawking, one of
the greatest physicists of our time,

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,720
didn't let a rare motor neurone 
illness that bound him

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,980
to a wheelchair stop him
from roaming everywhere else.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,810
Despite being told,
age 22, that he had only

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,110
a few years left to live,

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,510
he went on to live
for decades more,

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,370
his mind traveling 
through the cosmos,

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,780
making breakthroughs
in scientific theories

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,950
on black holes and relativity,

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,970
capturing the imagination
of millions around the world.

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,070
And he didn’t stop there.

16
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,900
“Don’t feel bad, Lisa.

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,270
Sometimes the
smartest of us can be

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,290
the most childish.”

19
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,280
“Even you?”

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,220
“No. Not me.”

21
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,830
He also broke through 
onto our screens and radios.

22
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,630
“You guys were never
even on Futurama.

23
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,250
I was on three times.”

24
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,090
With cameos on TV shows —

25
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,910
“You made an arithmetic 
mistake on page 2.”

26
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,560
— in advertisements
and in songs,

27
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,300
becoming a pop culture icon —

28
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,050
“If you are looking
for trouble, you found it.”

29
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,850
“Yeah, just try me, you ... ow!”

30
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,300
— displaying a wicked sense 
of humor as he went.

31
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,120
“It’s a little hard to read
your tone of voice.

32
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,690
When you say that, 
are you being sarcastic?”

33
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,690
“Yes.”

34
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,750
“I thought so.”

35
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,130
His familiar synthesized voice
graced Pink Floyd songs

36
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,090
and TV commercials.

37
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,270
“Mankind’s greatest achievements 
have come about by talking.”

38
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,360
“Seconds after the Big Bang,
called inflation,

39
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,660
in which the ... [scream]!”

40
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,130
He ran over rival physicists,
and had other celebrities

41
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,370
pandering to him
in comedy sketches.

42
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,460
“Time to find my new voice.”

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,460
“Surely it has to be me?

44
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,180
Listen to my voice.

45
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,350
It’s got a tinge of physics.”

46
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,410
He offered sound advice
to the next generation.

47
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,200
“What do you think is
the cosmological effect

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,570
of Zayn leaving
[pop music band] One Direction?”

49
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,470
“Finally, a question about
something important.

50
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,950
My advice to any
heartbroken young girl

51
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,829
is to pay loads of attention to
the study of theoretical physics.”

52
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:14,300
And in 2014, his extraordinary
life was immortalized

53
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,120
in a film titled "The
Theory Of Everything."

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,710
“All the way back,
to see what happened

55
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,341
at the beginning of time itself.”

56
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,960
While Hawking may have
left planet Earth,

57
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,710
his many fans can be sure
that his legacy remains.

58
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,270
“I could have gone on and on.

59
00:02:31,270 --> 00:00:00,000
Space, here I come.”
