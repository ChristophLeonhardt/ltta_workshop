1
00:00:02,092 --> 00:00:05,763
I'm Kim Bhasin, luxury
reporter at Bloomberg.

2
00:00:05,763 --> 00:00:07,896
Here to invite you to the most exclusive

3
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:10,026
realms of luxury retail.

4
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:12,369
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:15,127
This is invitation Only.

6
00:00:15,127 --> 00:00:16,315
(playful music)

7
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:19,223
Today I'm in the Upper East Side.

8
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:22,109
It's the poshest
neighborhood in Manhattan.

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,649
Four out of five fancy dogs agree.

10
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,654
(dog panting)

11
00:00:26,654 --> 00:00:28,691
Who loves wealthy neighborhoods?

12
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:30,212
You do!

13
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:31,936
Yes you do!

14
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:33,647
Yes you do!

15
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:35,630
Here, you'll find some of the most opulent

16
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,213
homes in the world.

17
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:39,939
Look at these places!

18
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,163
(playful music)

19
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:44,176
Now, if you have a fancy home,

20
00:00:44,176 --> 00:00:47,494
you need to fill it with
cool and weird stuff.

21
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:49,195
And there's no better
place for that than here,

22
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:52,278
at the Upper East Side's Creel & Gow.

23
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,161
(techno music)

24
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,411
(knocking)

25
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:00,751
Kim, welcome.

26
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:01,857
Jamie, what's up?

27
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:04,964
Hey, welcome to Creel & Gow.

28
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,797
What is this store, how
would you describe it to

29
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:09,375
someone who knows nothing about it?

30
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,670
Especially in the beginning,
I'd describe it to people

31
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,819
as a cabinet of curiosities.

32
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:15,783
A place where people can
find gifts or things for

33
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:19,282
their home, which are one
of a kind and we've sourced

34
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:22,849
around the world and brought
back here tho New York.

35
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,157
We have taxidermy, that's
usually the thing that people

36
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:29,180
are not used to seeing
here in New York City.

37
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,705
We have minerals, primal
art, we have craftsman

38
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:34,898
that are making things for us in Morocco

39
00:01:34,898 --> 00:01:38,716
and in Egypt, and even
here in the United States.

40
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:41,083
This is a, probably, 20 to 30 million

41
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,524
year old turtle shell.

42
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:43,632
Turtle shell fossil?

43
00:01:43,632 --> 00:01:45,010
Fossil, mounted.

44
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,009
These are these coconuts
which were carved in

45
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:51,236
the Caribbean in the 19th century by

46
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,098
French prisoners of war.

47
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:55,583
These are Chinese theater headdresses,

48
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,631
so they're from Chinese operas.

49
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,601
And they range in date
from the early 20th century

50
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:02,751
to mid-20th century.

51
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:06,378
This is the famous Park Avenue pot plant.

52
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:09,578
It's metal, so you can't smoke it, but...

53
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:12,521
I guess you could, if
you like shave it up.

54
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:13,522
It would be painful.

55
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:14,556
No, it would be kind of tough to do that.

56
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:15,389
Yeah, don't do that.

57
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:16,472
Don't do that at all.

58
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:18,101
(soft music)

59
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:21,158
Before I opened the store,
I spent a huge portion

60
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:24,305
of my years traveling and finding things

61
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:27,805
and now I'm finding it here for the store.

62
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:31,077
Where does that interest come from?

63
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:34,223
I've had a passion for
travel since I was a kid.

64
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:35,864
My family's from Long Island.

65
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,722
My grandmother and my great uncle were

66
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:39,994
the owners of Gardiner's
Island, which is out

67
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,146
on the end of Long Island.

68
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:42,598
It's been in my family for, I don't know,

69
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:44,646
400 years, or something.

70
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:48,887
When I was 15, my parents
sent me to Kenya for 3 months

71
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:52,585
and the last part of the
trip we were in Nairobi

72
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:55,619
and I didn't realize
that to them, blue jeans,

73
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:58,202
Levi's jeans were the gold standard.

74
00:02:58,202 --> 00:03:00,626
It was amazing to them.

75
00:03:00,626 --> 00:03:03,592
So I just went into the
markets and traded my jeans

76
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:07,150
for baskets and things
that were made by locals.

77
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,157
To me, that stuff was amazing and to them

78
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,090
they wanted my blue jeans,
which I knew I could go back

79
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,183
to New York and get another pair.

80
00:03:17,183 --> 00:03:21,024
And ever since then I've
had this passion for travel.

81
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:24,048
I was doing this for myself
up until right before

82
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:26,495
I opened this door and now
I'm doing it for the stores.

83
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:29,044
So it's just kind of part of my life.

84
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:30,902
It's traveling and finding things.

85
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:31,843
(sirens)

86
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:32,690
And police cars.

87
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,523
Police cars.

88
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:34,356
And ambulances.

89
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:35,300
(laughter)

90
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,154
Don't arrest me!

91
00:03:36,154 --> 00:03:37,514
(laughter)

92
00:03:37,514 --> 00:03:39,931
(calm music)

93
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:45,145
So tell me about the business
model here at Creel & Gow.

94
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:49,135
I'm not really following any
traditional business model,

95
00:03:49,135 --> 00:03:50,302
I have to say.

96
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:53,743
When I opened this, a lot
of my friends who have

97
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:56,024
businesses on Madison
Avenue and other places,

98
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:57,495
they're like "you're
crazy, to be opening a

99
00:03:57,495 --> 00:03:59,828
curiosity shop in New York."

100
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,581
But I thought well, I'm
doing something completely

101
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:05,194
different than everybody
else, and it's something

102
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:07,027
I really wanted to do.

103
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:11,040
We have plans to open,
eventually, a store in Harris,

104
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,717
and then the idea was to maybe
open out in San Francisco

105
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:15,329
at some point, too.

106
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:16,591
(upbeat music)

107
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,081
Is this store profitable?

108
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:20,065
Yeah, we make money, yeah.

109
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:20,919
Weirdly.

110
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,285
(laughter)

111
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:24,952
We're not Apple. But yes we are.

112
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:28,066
I think what we have
is something you really

113
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:31,320
kind of have to come and see what's here.

114
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,898
I hear this almost every single day here,

115
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,650
"wow, this is like a
museum, this is incredible."

116
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,236
It's an experience, they like that.

117
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,970
They like having an experience.

118
00:04:40,970 --> 00:00:00,000
And this is not work to
me, this is just fun.
