new reports say there has been no progress on the Kinder Morgan trans mountain pipeline in the nearly two months since Justin Trudeau bought the thing for far more than what it was worth according to Kinder Morgan there has been minimal spending from the federal government in the nearly two months since the federal government agreed to purchase the existing pipeline and then pushed forward with the construction of the trans mountain pipeline expansion through to Burnaby according to Kinder Morgan the project would be ramping up to spend 300 to 400 million dollars per month right now but again according to Kinder Morgan only 41 million was spent in June on construction and there are no figures available from the federal government for spending in July when Justin Trudeau paid too much for this 70 year old pipeline he assured Canada that the purchase of the pipeline was absolutely necessary to push construction through and yet no real construction is actually happening and we're coming up on the two-month mark since the purchase announcement for the pipeline and we are also rapidly running out of summer construction season time is growing short so we have no construction but what about opposition Justin Trudeau assured us that if we slapped a sticker of his smiling face on the side of this pipeline all opposition would suddenly disappear in British Columbia well as the city of Burnaby orders the eviction of trans mountain protestors at their infestation at Camp cloud on Burnaby Mountain a camp occupant squatter hobo I don't know the right word to use here anyway the person's name is candy Lee and according to Global News candy who's a he raised concerns that an attempt at an eviction at Camp cloud could follow in the footsteps of historical conflicts between police and indigenous protesters such as the oka crisis or the gustafson Lake standoff if you pray say a prayer for the Burnaby RCMP tonight because not only have they been under attack this entire time that the protest has been going on several cops have been hurt or even kicked in the head while dealing with the Mad Men and wackos at Camp cloud but when these people broach the subject of oka we need to really really be concerned that they are a filthy stinking flea-bitten powder keg just waiting to go off some of you out there might not be old enough to remember what happened at oka or maybe it's just been so long ago that you have forgotten it took place in 1990 in oka Quebec the oka crisis began as a land dispute over a golf course expansion the local Mohawks laid claim to the land and then their land claim was rejected by the Office of native land claims protest by Mohawks and then a blockade ensued after a court decision said that the golf course construction could proceed after a summer standoff a shot fired by a protestor with an ak-47 rifle killed police corporal Marcel LeMay in 1990 a coroner's inquest into the shooting found that the ak-47 was held by a Mohawk warrior whose intention was to kill corporal LeMay that day at least six protesters in the woods around oka had ak-47s that could have fired the shot but unfortunately the coroner was unable to identify the lone shooter and so no one was ever held responsible for the murder of corporal LeMay who left behind a pregnant wife now that didn't end the standoff at oka the military had to eventually be called in to end that standoff so when do these kook's a camp cloud are raising the specter of oka they are telling us that they are willing to kill police officers to make their anti-oil point as they flop around in the ditches on Burnaby Mountain so the camp cloud protesters are threatening violence maybe even murder and no construction has been started and where is Alberta premier Rachel Notley in all of this she was so eager to celebrate the purchase of trans Mountain even agreeing to backstop the construction and cost overruns with Alberta tax dollars which is also crazy by the way but why isn't Notley calling for peace calling for everybody to obey the rule of law to reject violence and why isn't Rachel Notley calling Justin Trudeau and asking him why a shovel hasn't hit the ground on his expensive pipeline project yet for the revolt media I'm Sheila Gunn read what you just saw there is the daily video that I do here at the rebel but did you know they also have my own weekly full-length show it's aptly called the gun show we talk about issues facing Canadian families but to get access to my show and the rest of our incredible premium content you should treat yourself to a rebel subscription today it is worth every single penny
