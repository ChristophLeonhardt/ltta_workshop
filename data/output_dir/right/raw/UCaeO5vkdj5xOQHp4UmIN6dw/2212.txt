00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
Barack Obama's farewell address began

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,170
last night and by now it may well be

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,960
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know it made me think a lot</font>

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">of times over the years I've made fun of</font>

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,880
Obama as a sissified anti-american

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,980
narcissus no nothing whose ignorance of

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way life works is matched only the</font>

8
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,730
by the Titanic arrogance of his

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,070
delusional self-importance which masks

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,420
an essential weakness and lack of

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,340
fortitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes him seem less like</font>

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,500
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful world leader and more like a</font>

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,599
whining sniveling little girl<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't</font>

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,670
invited<font color="#CCCCCC"> to her popular friend's birthday</font>

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">party sorry my mind drifted back to</font>

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,219
Barack Obama I've made fun of them a lot

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,140
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the years as a gormless left this</font>

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,059
buffoon who was being mindlessly cheered

19
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,370
on by a group of media and academic

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,140
elites who when asked to locate their

21
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,550
buttocks with two hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a flashlight</font>

22
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,010
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked to be excused and then ran</font>

23
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,250
away but now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama administration is</font>

24
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,260
coming to an end<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as we helplessly</font>

25
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,480
weep in gratitude I feel it's time to

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,250
soften our tone a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to</font>

27
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,800
overlook some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those all too human</font>

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,109
flaws that sometimes made Obama's

29
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,910
presence feel something like a cross

30
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,280
between a herpes sore and shingles<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,470
instead we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should take a more generous</font>

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,689
look at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the accomplishments for</font>

33
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,130
which this administration will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

remembered<font color="#E5E5E5"> long after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

35
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,600
forgotten you might not recall it now

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,009
except for the fact that Obama is

37
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,810
constantly reminding you but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

38

president<font color="#E5E5E5"> first took office this country</font>

39
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,500
was in the depths<font color="#CCCCCC"> of one of the worst</font>

40
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,689
crises since the Great Depression the

41
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,850
Democrat policy of forcing banks to make

42
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,470
home loans to people who couldn't repay

43
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,409
them had sent our economy spiraling crap

44
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,200
words and Obama saved the day by bailing

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,970
out irresponsible institutions and

46
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,860
funneling cheap money into wall street

47
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,900
while saddling job creators with

48
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,880
suffocating regulations that ensured

49
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,799
only the wealthy would prosper while the

50
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,049
poor became mired in dependency and the

51
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,450
middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> class virtually disappeared now</font>

52
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,119
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you may say well wait all he did</font>

53
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,189
was prop up fat cats while mortgaging

54
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:54,540
our children's future the debt<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

55
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,030
inflation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking personally my</font>

56
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">children have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always kind of annoyed me</font>

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,210
and if they're saddled by massive debt

58
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,189
and inflation I'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone anyway so</font>

59
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,439
tough and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the world stage</font>

60
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,299
when Obama took office the Russian

61
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,250
threat had been largely contained in the

62
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,869
Middle East was subsiding into peace

63
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,150
after years of warfare let's face it it

64
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,870
was boring

65
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,250
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

66
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,599
soldiers we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sitting around</font>

67
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,549
playing video games wasting their time

68
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,549
but happily thanks to obama<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world is</font>

69
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,709
once again completely in flames and that

70
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,150
means there'll be lots more of those

71
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,640
wonderful<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube videos of military men</font>

72
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">and women surprising their families by</font>

73
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,810
coming home unexpectedly from the

74
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,299
intolerable hell of war I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

75

want to leave you<font color="#CCCCCC"> hanging you know part</font>

177
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,970
of it was that Trump had gone to a

Russian hotel and hung<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with russian</font>

179
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,920

180
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,320
he had paid them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch them urinate</font>

181
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,060
on each other and all this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

182
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally am absolutely delighted to</font>

183
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,170
hear that there is some sexual

184
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,060
perversion that the left doesn't approve

185
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,990
of because almost the time if you're a

186
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,940
man who<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinks he's a woman sleeping</font>

00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,480
then that's a problem but you know again

193
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,670
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally unsubstantiated the</font>

194
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,040
Trump addresses this in his presser and

195
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,420
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't heard these clips yet so I'm</font>

196
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,410
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be hearing them with you</font>

197
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,060
because it's happening right now but

198
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,770
what did he have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say about all this</font>

199
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,690
these meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you know are</font>

200
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,000
confidential classified so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

201
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,680
allowed to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what went on in a</font>

202
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,170
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we had many witnesses in</font>

203
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,100
that meeting many of them with us and I

204
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,510
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> say again I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a disgrace</font>

205
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,920
that information would be let out I saw

206
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,330
the information I read the information

207
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,090
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that meeting it's all fake</font>

208
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,180
news it's phony stuff it didn't happen

209
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,990
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten by opponents of ours</font>

210
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,660
as you know because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> reported it and</font>

211
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,510
so did many of the other people it was a

212
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,430
group of opponents that got together

213
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,340
sick people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they put that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crap</font>

214
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,280
together so i will tell you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

215
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,930
within the meeting but outside of the

216
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,580
meeting somebody released it it should

217
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,720
never have been number one shouldn't

218
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,820
have even entered paper but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it should</font>

219
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,740
never have been released<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i read what</font>

220
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,110
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> released and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's a disgrace</font>

221

<font color="#E5E5E5">i think it's an absolute disgraced okay</font>

222
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,789
so let's let's address we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

223
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,049
address this from several different

224
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,810
angles i should add by the way that part

225
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,000
of this report<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that like Trump a</font>

226

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,040
went to Prague and met with the Russians

229

all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Cohen tweeted out his</font>

never been to Prague in his life and

233
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">that should be easy that's that's the</font>

234
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,290
kind of lie you tell that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font>

235
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,960
be too easy to check let's there a

236
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,420
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> extremely</font>

237
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,790
disturbing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them is we have</font>

newspaper The New York Times and they

241
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,459

have always erred on the side of

284
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,459
publishing in this case the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

285
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:45,839
in wide circulation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the highest</font>

levels of American government and media

287
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,320
it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lie behind a set of vague</font>

288
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,029
allegations from the Senate Majority

report that intelligence agencies have

delivered to the president and president

elect as we noted in our story there are

293
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,450
serious reason to doubt the allegations

294
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,790
publishing this document was not an easy

295
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,709
or simple call and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people of goodwill</font>

296

298
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,670
reflects how we see our job with

reporter as reporters and basically he

300
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,029
went on to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he wanted people us</font>

301
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:17,649
to be able to see the documents we could

302
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:20,560
make up our own mind and think about the

303
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,149
absurdity of that how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you supposed</font>

304

<font color="#E5E5E5">to make up your own mind what</font>

sure that something they're saying has

308
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,050
waited sources behind it waiting source

309
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,579
they can't always tell whether it's true

310

but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have got to have you know this</font>

it is just appalling that the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> ump</font>

313
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,850
hysteria has reached this level that

314
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,019
people would degrade themselves

315
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:46,990
especially at CNN that you know which is

316
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,970
supposed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most trusted name in</font>

317

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,649
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is appalling that the press</font>

319
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,149
would run with a story<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this and</font>

320
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,410
make it breathless while these hearings

321

are going on it's all it is all very

322
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">suspicious timing now let's talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

323
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,510
the weather or not Trump is a Russian

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,959
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you know my question is what</font>

326
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,880
would he do if he were a Russian spy

327
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,589
would he for instance let the Russians

328
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:17,230
get undue influence in Syria and make

329
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,250

all that stuff Obama has let the

336
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,630
Russians walk all over him so you know

337
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,720
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this question about Trump's</font>

338

[Music]

339
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,589
flattering talk about Vladimir Putin we

340
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:43,510
heard this flattering talk from<font color="#CCCCCC"> George W</font>

341
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bush</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember I looked into his soul</font>

342
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,310
which must have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a very very ugly</font>

343
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,199
experience we got it from Barack Obama

344
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,850
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reset</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our relationships</font>

345
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,949
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Russians and now we get it from</font>

346
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:56,410
Donald Trump who is basically saying I

347
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,209
want good relations with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russians</font>

348
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,120
here he is it the presser today likes

349
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,970
Donald Trump I consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an asset</font>

350
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">not a liability because we have a</font>

351
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:08,260
horrible relationship with Russia Russia

352
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,449
can help us fight Isis which by the way

353
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:13,569
is number one tricky I mean if you look

354
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:16,390
this administration created Isis by

355
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,520
leaving at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong time</font>

356
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,160
the void was created Isis was formed if

357
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,640
Putin likes Donald Trump guess what

358
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,920
folks that's called an asset not a

359
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,200
liability now I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

360
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,840
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get along with Vladimir Putin I</font>

361
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,480
hope I do but there's a good chance I

362
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,180
won't and if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do you honestly</font>

363
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,000
believe that Hillary would be tougher

364
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,190
when Putin than me does anybody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

365
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,140
room really believe that give me a break

366
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,700
it was pretty good<font color="#CCCCCC"> response and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

367
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,930
president of President Obama himself

368
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:59,770
weighed in on this too cuz he's a lame

369
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,450
duck yeah now Rex Tillerson who is

370
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,840
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the CEO of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Exxon Mobil and</font>

371
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,780

372
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,910
questioned he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of business</font>

373
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,230
with Russia and they're questioning him

374
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,730
on whether he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be soft with</font>

375
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,380
Russia here is Marco Rubio<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real Hawk</font>

376
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,150
giving you to him pretty solidly his

377
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,210
vitami<font color="#CCCCCC"> route in the war criminal I would</font>

378
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,490
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> use that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> term well let me describe</font>

379
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the situation in Aleppo and perhaps that</font>

380
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,170
will help you reach that conclusion in

381
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,270
Aleppo mr. Putin has directed his

382
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,070
military to conduct a devastating

383
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,380
campaign he's targeted schools mark it's

384
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,910
not just assisted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Syrians in doing</font>

385
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,070
it his military has targeted schools and

386
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,780
markets and other civilian

387
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,670
infrastructure it's resulted in the

388
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,010
death of thousands of civilians this is

389
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,840
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mr. Putin is involved</font>

390
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,520
in campaigns of this kind and what's

391
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,810
publicly in the record about what's

392
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,070
happened in aleppo on the Russian

393
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,290
military you are still not prepared to

394
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,910
say that Vladimir Putin<font color="#CCCCCC"> his military</font>

395
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">have violated the rules of war and have</font>

396
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,910
conducted war crimes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aleppo those are</font>

397
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,970
very very serious charges to make and I

398
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,200
would want to have much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more information</font>

399
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
before reaching a conclusion I

400
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,490
understand there is a body of record in

401
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the public domain I'm sure there's a</font>

402
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">body of record in the classified domain</font>

403
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,940
and I think in order in order to deal

404
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,100
with a serious question like this

405
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,560
citizen<font color="#CCCCCC"> power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level is in the pub</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

406
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the videos in the pictures of</font>

408
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,960
president well I encourage you there's

409
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,280
so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it there is so much</font>

410
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">information out there</font>

411
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,500
what's happening in the local leaving

412
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,210
the Chechen issue aside what happened

413
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,680
there is clearly documented as well

414
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,840
there's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much information out there it</font>

415
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,030
should not be hard to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Vladimir</font>

416
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,770
Putin's military has conducted war

417
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,480
crimes in Aleppo because it is never

418
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,400
acceptable you would agree for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

419
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,080
military to specifically target

420
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,820
civilians which is what's happened there

421
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,400
through the Russian<font color="#CCCCCC"> military and you</font>

422
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,960
