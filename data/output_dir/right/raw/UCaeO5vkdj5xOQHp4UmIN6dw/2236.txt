<font color="#CCCCCC">i was a kid and that that when that was</font>

165
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,900
i was a kid there were three men who

166
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,870
represented what an American<font color="#E5E5E5"> man was to</font>

167
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,550
me which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important because if</font>

168
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,110
you read my memoir you'll see I didn't

169
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,030
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of male role models that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

170
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,130
could appreciate and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed people to</font>

171
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,510
guide me I looked in literature and I'll

172
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously looked in pop culture and the</font>

173
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,200
three were Mickey Mantle who was the

174
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,850
senator great center fielder<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the New</font>

175
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,070
York Yankees John F Kennedy who was the

176
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,600
president so we all admire him

177
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,450
enormously<font color="#E5E5E5"> and John Glenn who was the</font>

178
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,880
hero of the age I mean he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you</font>

179
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,280
know beyond imagining it's it's it's

180
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,960
impossible to describe what a great hero

181
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,940
he was and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I got older and</font>

182
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,340
the news media started to tell more of

183
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,780
the truth about people's lives it turned

184
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,510
out that both JFK and Mickey Mantle were

185
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,180
not what they were cut out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be I mean</font>

186
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,170
JFK was a philanderer and very very

187
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,510
sinister in some ways politician I'm not

188
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,740
saying he was the worst president ever

189
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,320
he wasn't that he's the worst president

190
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,270
ever is about to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave office but JFK</font>

191
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,830
was you know he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good guy he</font>

192
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,370
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good person and</font>

193
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,110
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh and certainly Mickey Mantle who</font>

194
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,699
probably was a nice person was a

195
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,460
terrible drunk he said very movingly

196
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,169
before he died when it came down with

197
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:47,610
liver cancer he said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

198
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">being a role model I'm a role model</font>

199
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,270
don't do what I did I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean so he was so</font>

200
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,610
these way John Glenn was who he seemed

201
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,050
to be and that doesn't mean he was

202
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,910
perfect you know the press likes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

203
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,199
us think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if a guy isn't perfect</font>

204
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,850
he's terrible you know it has nothing to

205
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,560
do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> being perfect but he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a great</font>

206
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,080
hero if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you read Tom Wolfe's the right</font>

207
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,880
stuff he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the epitome of the right</font>

208
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,590
stuff a guy whose heart beat didn't even

209
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,630
speed up when he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was launched into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font>

210
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,750
he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> married to the woman he met in</font>

211
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,729
his crib virtually I think she<font color="#E5E5E5"> was two</font>

212
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,470
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old when he married annie my</font>

213
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,900
favorite story about him is that Annie

214
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,539
had famously had this terrible terrible

215
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,610
stutter she could barely speak and when

216
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,500
Lyndon Johnson then the vice president

217
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,729
wanted to meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> with her in front of the</font>

218
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:28,380
camera she panics she said she<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't</font>

219
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,690
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and John Glenn basically told the</font>

220
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,969
vice president to get stuff that he said

221
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:34,799
like he said they aren't he said Annie

222
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,539
if you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vice president in</font>

223
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,000
your house he is not coming in the house

224
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,880
and the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I just love about her</font>

225
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,099
it was apparently one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the great</font>

226
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,339
marriages and she in the 70s I think

227
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe the 80s they developed a new</font>

228
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,630
technique for improving stutters and she

229
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">went into this program and she came back</font>

230
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,860
and she was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak better and she</font>

231
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,020
said she said to John Glenn there's

232
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,160
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been wanting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font>

233
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,050
for years pick up your socks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is if</font>

234
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,700
my wife was kept silent for years that

235
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be the first thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she said to me</font>

236
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,089
too anyway a great hero when here you

237
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:12,000
know when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are what they seem to</font>

238
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">be when heroes are what they seem to be</font>

239
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,230
you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that people would love</font>

240
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,420
this but they don't you know one of the

241
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,610
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw John Glenn in person when</font>

242
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,050
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was running for president and he was</font>

243
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,610
boring<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was not like it</font>

244
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,980
because he was a real person people want

245
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,420
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that their heroes have feet of</font>

246
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,240
clay they would much rather adore and

247
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,690
worship some rock star slag because she

248
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't hold them up to any standard</font>

249
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,650
higher than their own they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

250
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,060
time they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> drunk and wake up with</font>

251
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody that they don't know they can</font>

252
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:42,360
say well you know Madonna does it so

253
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,910
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay with me when you have a real</font>

254
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,339
hero like George Washington or John

255
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,589
Glenn and they really live up to those

256
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,150
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it basically says to you can be</font>

257
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,900
better

258
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,730
and nobody wants to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and nobody</font>

259
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,320
wants to hear that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can actually be</font>

260
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,540
who they pretend they are they would

261
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,310
much rather be who they you know can

262
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,110
laugh about with their<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends and while</font>

263
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,760
they destroy their and other people's

264
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,700
lives great but great men call us to a

265
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,190
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> level John Glenn did that Godspeed</font>

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,890
but they didn't release that information

313
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,440
whereas the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RNC says we had the FBI in</font>

314
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,620
here to explore our computers and they

315
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,840
were not act at all so the source is

316
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,780
already questionable this story is crap

317
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,070
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they're aiming</font>

318
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,600
at eyes I really do<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that they're</font>

319
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,950
aiming a little bit at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> electoral</font>

320
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">college hoping some of these electors or</font>

321
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,820
faithless electors which by the way we

322
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,490
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the send the country up in smoke if</font>

323
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,040
this somehow the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Electoral College</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font>

324
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,690
this election around and they thought if

325
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,340
they think that Hillary Clinton is going

326
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,220
to be installed by a deus ex machina

327
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,470
that's not going to happen now listen

328
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,930
again it's it's important if the

329
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,640
Russians are hacking computers we want

330
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,960
to know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not saying that but</font>

331
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,540
this story<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular story is crap</font>

332
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,430
and i have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say and of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

333
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,650
first let's take it from the Democratic

334
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,140
talking points of view the Democrats are

335
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,940
calling for an investigation Claire

336
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,190
McCaskill was the spokeswoman this

337
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,830
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be not only about protecting us</font>

338
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,170
going forward but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a form of</font>

339
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,310
warfare for Vladimir Putin who is a thug

340
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,830
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bully and has the friends around</font>

341
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,480
the globe that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font>

342
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,820
friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> with for him to be trying to</font>

343
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,940
impact our elections that we have to

344
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,710
there has to be has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> held</font>

345
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,110
accountable and that's why this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

346
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,090
well that's that's some of that's

347
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,090
classified I believe and I don't think

348
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's something that we can discuss on TV</font>

349
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,070
but I've had briefings just this last

350
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,280
week that indicate that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a very</font>

351
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,560
serious issue for the American people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

352
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,080
understand and for Donald Trump to

353
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,900
dismiss out of hand the intelligence

354
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,280
community's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact-gathering is frankly</font>

355
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,600
doesn't bode well<font color="#CCCCCC"> for him protecting our</font>

356
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,640
country I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to not</font>

357
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,520
immediately react and wait until<font color="#CCCCCC"> he gets</font>

358
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,550
all the facts so the irony here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

359
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,430
endless I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say of course John</font>

360
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">McCain and Lindsey Graham the two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

361
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,100
useful idiots in the Senate you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

362
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">Democrat useful idiots immediately said</font>

363
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,240
yes we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bipartisan investigation</font>

364
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,800
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know it's like it is walking</font>

365
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">into this thing and of course you have</font>

366
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,870
to investigate

367
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,529
the Russian involvement but you know the

368
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:23,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Democrats who have been</font>

369
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,400
cozying up they've been they have been

370
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,480
run blind Vladimir Putin has run circles

371
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,070
around Barack Obama he has made him look

372
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,110
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a child let's not go back to the</font>

373
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,160
Russian we don't even have to talk about

374
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,380
the Russian reset or remember Obama

375
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,910
getting caught on the hot mic saying

376
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,070
tell Vladimir I'll have more flexibility

377
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,140
after I I get reelected and all this

378
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,380
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it and all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

379
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,089
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> all and the other thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the CIA is</font>

380
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:49,700
basically accusing the Russians of doing

381
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,370
the media's job for them they're getting

382
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,560
the news that the media<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't get but</font>

383
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,779
you know the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is the sudden</font>

384
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:59,930
confidence in our CIA and our

385
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,720
intelligence service who are the ones as

386
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,820
Trump was quick to point out who are the

387
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,279
ones who told us that Saddam Hussein had

388
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,710
weapons of mass destruction you know

389
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,660
these these are also theirs is the wall

390
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,620
street journal let me read just one

391
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,760
quick paragraph from The Wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> Street</font>

392
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,800
Journal if the CIA really does have high

393
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,740
confidence about mr. Putin's motives how

394
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,020
they would know that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but</font>

395
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">this would also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first time in</font>

396
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,709
recent history these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the same seers</font>

397
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,480
who missed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russian invasion of</font>

398
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,459
Crimea missed the incursion into

399
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,920
southern Ukraine and missed mr. Putin's

400
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,080
foray into Syria the intelligence

401
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,790
community also claimed high confidence

402
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,430
in 2008 for its judgment that Iran had

403
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,080
suspended its nuclear weapons program

404
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,779
that judgment conveniently shut down any

405
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,670
further Bush administration action

406
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,589
against Iran but<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year later in the</font>

407
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:47,420
Obama administration are highly

408
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,580
confident spooks disclosed<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iran's secret</font>

409
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,850
photo underground facility so I mean you

410
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,190
know it's like they what they do what

411
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">they do with Trump now well let's let's</font>

412
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,640
listen to Trump's reaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump just</font>

413
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,529
blew this off in a very refreshing way

414
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:02,270
as far as I'm concerned I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

415
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,860
ridiculous i think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just another</font>

416
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,700
excuse I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I don't know</font>

417
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,940
why and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's just you know they</font>

418
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,760
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things every</font>

419
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,350
week it's another excuse we had a

420
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,140
massive landslide victory as you know in

421
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> electoral college</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess the final</font>

422
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">numbers are now at 30 sixth and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she's</font>

423
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,670
you know down to a very low number no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

424
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,350
don't believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at all you say you</font>

425
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know why do you think that the CIA</font>

426
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">is trying to overturn the result</font>

427
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,960
no your<font color="#E5E5E5"> life as Sarah's on how to to</font>

428
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,820
weaken you in office well if you look at

429
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> story and you take a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

430
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">they said there's great confusion nobody</font>

431
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,970
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows and hacking is very</font>

432
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,610
interesting once they hack if you don't

433
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,780
catch them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the act you're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

434
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">to catch him they have no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of its</font>

435
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,580
Russia or China or somebody it could be

436
