JUDGE JEANINE: LIBERTY UNIVERSITY IN LYNCH BURKE, VIRGINIA IS A NON-PROFIT CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY WHERE STUDENTS AND FACULTY PRACTICE WHAT THEY PREACH. I HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT AND GOT A FIRST-HAND TOUR FROM ITS PRESIDENT, JERRY FALWELL, JR. HOW IS IT THIS UNIVERSITY IN PARTICULAR IS ABLE TO GET SO MANY STUDENTS WHO WERE SO CHRISTIAN ORIENTED, CONSTITUTION ORIENTED, WHO BELIEVE IN THIS COUNTRY AND ARE SO ENERGIZED BY WHAT'S GOING ON? I CALL LIBERTY THE FOX NEWS NETWORK. THE CHRONICLE SAID THE SUCCESS OF LIBERTY UNIVERSITY IS ROOTED IN THE FACT THAT LIBERTY DOESN'T TRY TO BE LIKE EVERY OTHER UNIVERSITY. WE TRY TO EMPHASIZE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. WE TRY TO KEEP EDUCATION AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. THE TOWER IS THE SCHOOL OF DIFFICULT VINITY. IT'S 270 FEET HIGH. THERE IS A CLASSROOM ON EVERY FLOOR. UNDER THE LAW THERE ARE THREE BASKETBALL COURTS WHERE THE BASKETBALL TEAM PRACTICES. THOSE ARE THE NEWER DORMS UP ON THE HILL. A LOT OF NEW CONSTRUCTION GOING ON STILL.

THIS IS THE ON GRANDBABY WE HAVE. JUDGE JEANINE: SHE'LL BE A STUDENT HERE? IT WILL BE UP TO HER. JUDGE JEANINE: WITH THE MID TERMS COMING UP, DO YOU THINK THOSE ON THE LEFT ARE NOT JUST OUT OF CONTROL, BUT THEY ARE JUST IN TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THE STUDENTS HERE? I THINK THE COUNTRY HAS NEVER BEEN MORE POLARIZED. WHEN I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL IN THE 80s I WOULD TRAVEL WITH MY FAR IT AND STUDENTS WOULD BOO AND HISS BECAUSE HE WAS A CONSERVATIVE. LIBERALS WOULD SAY I MAY NOT AGREE WITH YOU, BUT I AGREE WITH YOUR RIGHT TO SAY IT. BUT NOW THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO SAY IT. THEY HAVE BECOME FASCISTS IN MY OPINION. I THINK IT' YEARS AND YEARS OF SCHOOLS CONTROLLED BY THE TEACHERS' UNIONS. ALL THE PROFESSORS BELIEVE THE SAME WAY. 98% SUPPORTED OBAMA AT THE IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS. JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT CAN LIBERTY DO TO CHANGE THAT. THAT'S WHY WE EXIST IN IS AN
