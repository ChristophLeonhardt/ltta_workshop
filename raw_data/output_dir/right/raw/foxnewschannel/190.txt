1
00:00:00,355 --> 00:00:01,355
IT WILL BE HERE BEFORE YOU KNOW

2
00:00:01,356 --> 00:00:04,591
IT, BACK TO YOU.

3
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:05,392
>> Harris: KEVIN CORKE,

4
00:00:05,393 --> 00:00:06,793
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

5
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:08,562
LET'S BRING IN RONNA McDANIEL,

6
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:09,763
GREAT TO SEE YOU ALWAYS.

7
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:12,766
THE LAST TIME WE TALKED WE WERE

8
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:14,835
SPEAKING ABOUT THE NUMBERS, THE

9
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:17,037
RECORD FUND-RAISING THE RNC HAS

10
00:00:17,038 --> 00:00:17,571
DONE.

11
00:00:17,572 --> 00:00:19,039
THERE HAS BEEN EVEN MORE

12
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,875
MOVEMENT AS YOU MOVE UP TO THE

13
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:22,409
MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

14
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,212
>> WE RAISED OVER $252 MILLION

15
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:28,582
AND WHAT THAT TRANSLATES TO HIS

16
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,817
BOOTS ON THE GROUND, 25,000

17
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:33,020
FIELD ORGANIZERS, FIVE TIMES

18
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:35,989
MORE THAN WE HAD GOING INTO

19
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,658
2016, 540 STAFF ON THE GROUND IN

20
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:39,393
28 STATES.

21
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:40,927
WE ARE ALL ENERGIZED TO TURN OUT

22
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:43,997
OUR VOTE BUT WE HAD THE

23
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:44,965
INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE THOSE

24
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:47,167
LAST-MINUTE DOORKNOBS, MAKE THE

25
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:48,769
CASE OF RESULTS VERSUS

26
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,536
RESISTANCE AND SHARE WHAT VOTERS

27
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:50,270
AND REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE TO

28
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:52,406
MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER.

29
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:53,974
>> Harris: THERE IS TYPICALLY

30
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:54,941
A HEADWIND, SOMETIMES UPWARDS OF

31
00:00:54,942 --> 00:01:00,781
30 SEATS, BARACK OBAMA LOST

32
00:01:00,782 --> 00:01:03,150
NORTH OF 60 IN HIS FIRST MIDTERM

33
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:03,950
ELECTION.

34
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:04,951
WHAT HAS MADE THE DIFFERENCE TO

35
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:06,019
TURN THE HEADWIND A LITTLE MORE

36
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,055
WIND AT YOUR BACK RIGHT NOW?

37
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:10,957
>> THE CHOICE IS VERY CLEAR.

38
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,459
AS DEMOCRATS HAVE OBSTRUCTED

39
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,294
THIS PRESIDENT EVERY STEP OF THE

40
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:16,897
WAY AND THE CULMINATION OF THE

41
00:01:16,898 --> 00:01:19,032
KAVANAUGH HEARING, SEEING THE

42
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:20,233
INTERRUPTIONS, THE PAID

43
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:21,601
PROTESTERS, THAT THEY WOULD DO

44
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:22,836
ANYTHING THEY COULD TO STOP

45
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:24,571
BRETT KAVANAUGH FROM SERVING ON

46
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:26,173
THE BENCH AND YOU CONTRAST THAT

47
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:28,208
WITH THE RESULTS OF WHAT

48
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:29,676
REPUBLICANS HAVE PUT FORWARD FOR

49
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:31,511
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, HIGHER

50
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:32,746
WAGES, 4 MILLION NEW JOBS, HIDE

51
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:34,015
THE

52
00:01:39,353 --> 00:01:42,222
HIGH GDP, IT'S A CLEAR CONTRAST

53
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:44,191
AND IF VOTERS -- THE ONLY WAY

54
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,992
VOTERS WILL GET THIS DEMOCRACY

55
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:48,695
WORKING AGAIN IS TO READ RESIST

56
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:49,629
THE PLAYBOOK DEMOCRATS HAVE

57
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,566
COUNTED ON FOR THE PAST TWO

58
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:52,866
YEARS.

59
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:55,435
>> Harris: IT ALL KIND OF TIES

60
00:01:55,436 --> 00:01:56,870
IN, A NUMBER OF CANDIDATES SAY

61
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:58,505
THEY WOULD LIKE THE PRESIDENT TO

62
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:00,974
SHOW UP ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

63
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:06,480
YOU HAVE GIVEN THE ENDORSEMENT

64
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:09,483
LEVEL A SECOND TERM.

65
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:12,853
WHEN THE PRESIDENT ENDORSES YOU,

66
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:14,354
I'D LIKE TO SEE HOW MANY HANDS

67
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:18,358
WILL GO AGAINST THAT.

68
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:19,860
>> I'M SO HONORED THAT THE

69
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:20,861
PRESIDENT CHOSE ME TO BE ONLY

70
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:24,564
THE SECOND WOMAN TO RUN THE

71
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:25,565
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE,

72
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:28,502
IT SHOWS HOW MUCH HE VALUES

73
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:30,570
WOMEN.

74
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,271
I WAS ELECTED UNANIMOUSLY AND

75
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:34,708
I'M HONORED TO HAVE HIS SUPPORT

76
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:35,709
AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

77
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,179
SUPPORTING HIM IN THE REELECT.

78
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,180
>> Harris: HAVE YOU HAD A

79
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:42,382
CHANCE TO TALK THE WINNING

80
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:43,083
MESSAGE AND WHAT'S WORKING?

81
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:45,986
>> THE MESSAGE HAS TO BE THE

82
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:47,287
CONTRAST, THE PRESIDENT AND I

83
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:48,388
HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT.

84
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:50,824
YOU HAVE TO PUT FORWARD TO

85
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,592
VOTERS WHAT'S HAPPENING, WHAT WE

86
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:53,593
CAN ACHIEVE IS A COUNTRY AND

87
00:02:53,594 --> 00:02:56,263
WHAT WE WILL LOSE IF WE TURN

88
00:02:56,264 --> 00:03:01,601
BACK THE CLOCK TO THE

89
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:02,335
NANCY PELOSI-CHUCK SCHUMER DARK

90
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:02,636
AGES.

91
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:04,838
WE RESTORED OUR COUNTRY AS A

92
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:07,174
GLOBAL LEADER, THERE IS IT SO

93
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:09,276
MANY GOOD THINGS HAPPENING FOR

94
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:09,943
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, LOWEST

95
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:12,746
UNEMPLOYMENT IN HISTORY FOR THE

96
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:14,714
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC

97
00:03:14,715 --> 00:03:16,249
COMMUNITIES.

98
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,587
DEMOCRATS ARE OFFERING NOTHING.

99
00:03:20,588 --> 00:03:22,022
THEY'VE DONE NOTHING BUT RESIST

100
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:22,722
AND ABSTRACT.

101
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:23,957
THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE CASE TO

102
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,992
THE VOTERS, WHAT'S AT STAKE TO

103
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:28,962
LOSE AND WHAT HAPPENS IF THE

104
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,230
DEMOCRATS TAKE THE MAJORITY.

105
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:31,231
>> Harris: IT'S SO

106
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:32,265
INTERESTING, I KNOW THE

107
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,800
PRESIDENT IS GETTING READY TO GO

108
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:35,402
TO SOME PLACES WHERE YOU MIGHT

109
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:38,205
NOT OF THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE

110
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:39,072
CONTENTION LIKE ARIZONA, YOU'RE

111
00:03:39,073 --> 00:00:00,000
SEEING CHANGE.
