we have this wildcard oh by the way a massive investigation into the administration and the presidency of the man who's now going to put up his second name for the court it's going to be an incredible calendar to watch it really is I mean this and our summer just got a whole lot crazier thanks for pointing out a trick easy enough no vacation time for you Brian yeah but this is the reason why I think this is going to be such a seminal moment in his presidency is Supreme Court fights for Republicans are such a part of their political culture it is engrained in the right in a way that it is not in the left it's a part of their DNA they understand the importance of a court seat much more than liberals do liberals have a much less cohesive ideology the right on the other hand they still feel the sting of Bork of Breyer I'm sorry of Souter of the use Souter as a verb they do yes exactly to get su turd so they in and Clarence Thomas by the way too these these Supreme Court fights were such climactic moments in their political identity and of course it all stops at abortion the culture wars they have been losing in the Supreme Court in the culture wars for a generation this is now a time where they hope they can reverse that and I really do think that this could be a galvanizing moment for them going into the midterm elections when they've just come off a victory with nominating confirming a Supreme Court justice that they're very happy with and that could give them some momentum going into November hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
