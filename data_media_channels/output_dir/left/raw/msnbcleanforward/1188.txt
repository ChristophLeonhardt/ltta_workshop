WOULD HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO DIDN’T KNOW

33
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:36,597
UNITED STATES WHO DIDN’T KNOW ONE OF LIFE’S BASIC RULES, NEVER

00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,332
ONE OF LIFE’S BASIC RULES, NEVER GOOGLE YOURSELF.

35
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,468
GOOGLE YOURSELF. >> I HAVE AN IDEA THAT MIGHT

37
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,571
HELP HIM A LITTLE BIT, THAT IS SAY DON’T DECIDE OR FIGHT TAKING

SO THE RESULTS REFLECT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AND

44
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:58,386
HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AND THERE’S SOMETHING VERY HEALTHY

45
00:01:58,387 --> 00:01:59,487
THERE’S SOMETHING VERY HEALTHY ABOUT WATCHING THESE TECH

46
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:07,829
ABOUT WATCHING THESE TECH COMPANIES IN THE WAY THAT THEY

47
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:11,666
COMPANIES IN THE WAY THAT THEY COLLATE HOW THINGS WILL BE TAKEN

48
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:11,899
COLLATE HOW THINGS WILL BE TAKEN IN.

00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:16,637
DISAGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE POWER, THE UNCHECKED POWER OF

52
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:18,873
POWER, THE UNCHECKED POWER OF THINGS LIKE FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE.

53
00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:22,410
THINGS LIKE FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE. TWITTER, STUFF LIKE THAT.

54
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:23,878
TWITTER, STUFF LIKE THAT. BUT ARE YOU SITTING DOWN THERE

55
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,679
BUT ARE YOU SITTING DOWN THERE WHERE YOU ARE?

HOUSE. LISTEN TO THIS.

62
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:35,923
LISTEN TO THIS. >> I THINK GOOGLE IS REALLY

63
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:37,158
>> I THINK GOOGLE IS REALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A LOT OF

64
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:38,693
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND I THINK THAT’S A

65
00:02:38,694 --> 00:02:41,195
PEOPLE, AND I THINK THAT’S A VERY SERIOUS THING, AND IT’S A

66
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:42,229
VERY SERIOUS THING, AND IT’S A VERY SERIOUS CHARGE.

67
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:43,831
VERY SERIOUS CHARGE. I THINK WHAT GOOGLE AND OTHERS

68
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,533
I THINK WHAT GOOGLE AND OTHERS ARE DOING, IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT’S

69
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:48,236
ARE DOING, IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT’S GOING ON AT TWITTER AND

70
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:49,704
GOING ON AT TWITTER AND FACEBOOK, THEY BETTER BE

71
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:50,605
FACEBOOK, THEY BETTER BE CAREFUL, BECAUSE YOU CAN’T DO

72
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:51,439
CAREFUL, BECAUSE YOU CAN’T DO THAT TO PEOPLE.

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,907
THAT TO PEOPLE. YOU CAN’T DO IT.

74
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:54,308
YOU CAN’T DO IT. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS -- WE HAVE

75
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,610
WE HAVE TREMENDOUS -- WE HAVE LITERALLY THOUSANDS AND

76
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:57,645
LITERALLY THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS COMING

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:57,912
THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS COMING IN.

78
00:02:57,947 --> 00:02:59,414
IN. AND YOU JUST CAN’T DO THAT.

79
00:02:59,415 --> 00:03:02,450
AND YOU JUST CAN’T DO THAT. SO I THINK THAT GOOGLE AND

80
00:03:02,451 --> 00:03:03,952
SO I THINK THAT GOOGLE AND TWITTER AND FACEBOOK, THEY’RE

81
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:05,987
TWITTER AND FACEBOOK, THEY’RE REALLY TREADING ON VERY, VERY

82
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:07,656
REALLY TREADING ON VERY, VERY TROUBLED TERRITORY, AND YOU HAVE

83
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:08,623
TROUBLED TERRITORY, AND YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

84
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,357
TO BE CAREFUL. IT’S NOT FAIR TO LARGE PORTIONS

85
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:10,959
IT’S NOT FAIR TO LARGE PORTIONS OF THE POPULATION.

86
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:12,727
OF THE POPULATION. >> SO JIM, COULD YOU DEAL WITH

87
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:15,163
>> SO JIM, COULD YOU DEAL WITH THAT WHILE THE REST OF MY HEAD

88
00:03:15,198 --> 00:03:15,530
THAT WHILE THE REST OF MY HEAD EXPLODES?

89
00:03:15,564 --> 00:03:17,465
EXPLODES? >> WELL, I’LL BE REALLY

90
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:19,033
>> WELL, I’LL BE REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT THE --

91
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:20,936
INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT THE -- WHAT REGULATORY STEPS THE WHITE

92
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:22,771
WHAT REGULATORY STEPS THE WHITE HOUSE AND ALLIES ON THE HILL

93
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:23,105
HOUSE AND ALLIES ON THE HILL PROPOSE.

94
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,073
PROPOSE. I ALSO WONDER HOW REPUBLICAN

95
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:27,809
I ALSO WONDER HOW REPUBLICAN RANK AND FILE WILL FEEL ABOUT

96
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:31,546
RANK AND FILE WILL FEEL ABOUT REGULATING SPEECH.

97
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:33,948
REGULATING SPEECH. BUT IT’S AN ASTOUNDING MOMENT.

98
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,983
BUT IT’S AN ASTOUNDING MOMENT. FASCINATING, IF YOU THINK ABOUT

99
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:36,852
FASCINATING, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, TWITTER MADE PRESIDENT

100
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:38,387
IT, TWITTER MADE PRESIDENT TRUMP’S CANDIDACY.

101
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:40,389
TRUMP’S CANDIDACY. IT’S WHAT HE KIND OF REALLY

102
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,557
IT’S WHAT HE KIND OF REALLY COMMUNICATES THROUGH.

103
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,893
COMMUNICATES THROUGH. YET HE’S HSALSO TAPPING INTO

104
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:47,028
YET HE’S HSALSO TAPPING INTO SUSPICION OF THE TECH GIANTS,

105
00:03:47,063 --> 00:03:49,164
SUSPICION OF THE TECH GIANTS, SOME OF WHICH GO TO BOTH SIDES

106
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:49,965
SOME OF WHICH GO TO BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.

107
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:52,000
OF THE AISLE. SO IT’S JUST -- I’M GOING TO

108
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,402
SO IT’S JUST -- I’M GOING TO HAVE TO SIT AND THINK THROUGH

00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:56,438
HAVE TO SIT AND THINK THROUGH THIS ONE, AS WELL, MAYBE WITH A

110
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:56,871
THIS ONE, AS WELL, MAYBE WITH A CALCULATOR.

111
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:57,706
CALCULATOR. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

112
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:59,608
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK? >> MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE STRATEGY

113
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:02,177
>> MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE STRATEGY AND BEHAVIOR IS CALLED

114
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:02,577
AND BEHAVIOR IS CALLED VICTIMOLOGY.

115
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,580
VICTIMOLOGY. HIS DEFENSE IS GOING TO BE,

116
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:05,314
HIS DEFENSE IS GOING TO BE, THEY’RE FRAMING ME.

117
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:06,148
THEY’RE FRAMING ME. I’M A VICTIM.

118
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:07,616
I’M A VICTIM. THE COURTS ARE OUT TO GET ME.

DOJ IS OUT TO GET ME. THE FBI IS OUT TO GET ME.

121
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:11,620
THE FBI IS OUT TO GET ME. THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THE

SOCIAL MEDIA ARE ALL OUT TO GET ME.

125
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:19,728
ME. IF THAT’S THE BEST HE CAN DO IN

126
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,531
IF THAT’S THE BEST HE CAN DO IN HIS DEFENSE, THEN WE’RE GOING TO

127
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:22,898
HIS DEFENSE, THEN WE’RE GOING TO BE OKAY.

128
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:24,233
BE OKAY. BUT HERE’S THE PROBLEM AND THE

129
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:25,000
BUT HERE’S THE PROBLEM AND THE SERIOUS PART OF THIS.

130
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:27,202
SERIOUS PART OF THIS. WHILE HE’S TALKING ABOUT GOOGLE

131
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:28,637
WHILE HE’S TALKING ABOUT GOOGLE BEING BIASED AGAINST HIM, THE

132
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:30,405
BEING BIASED AGAINST HIM, THE REALITY IS THAT THE RUSSIAN BOTS

133
00:04:30,407 --> 00:04:32,541
REALITY IS THAT THE RUSSIAN BOTS ARE STILL OUT THERE, TRYING TO

134
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:34,243
ARE STILL OUT THERE, TRYING TO INFLUENCE SEARCH ENGINES, TRYING

TO INFLUENCE TWITTER, FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS, AND MESSAGES.

137
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:39,315
ACCOUNTS, AND MESSAGES. SO HE’S RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS IT’S

138
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:39,648
SO HE’S RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS IT’S RIGGED.

139
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,350
RIGGED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT’S RIGGED

140
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:42,852
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT’S RIGGED IN HIS FAVOR, BECAUSE THE

141
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:44,120
IN HIS FAVOR, BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS ARE STILL OUT THERE

142
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:44,753
RUSSIANS ARE STILL OUT THERE DOING THIS.

143
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:47,956
DOING THIS. >> MICHAEL, DO YOU WANT TO RUSH

144
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,658
>> MICHAEL, DO YOU WANT TO RUSH UP TO THE HILL TO TELL THE

145
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:52,060
UP TO THE HILL TO TELL THE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE SENATE

146
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:53,829
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE SENATE THAT FRANK JUST POINTED OUT THE

150
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,374
THEY OBVIOUS HI DON’T.LY DON’T. TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY THAT

151
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:07,743
TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY THAT IS DRIVEL.

152
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:09,778
IS DRIVEL. THE IDEA THAT HE LOOKED AT

153
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,681
THE IDEA THAT HE LOOKED AT GOOGLE AND CONSIDERS IT RIGGED

154
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:13,282
GOOGLE AND CONSIDERS IT RIGGED AGAINST HIM, BECAUSE AGAIN, IT’S

155
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:15,284
AGAINST HIM, BECAUSE AGAIN, IT’S ALL ABOUT HIM, NOT THE FACT THAT

156
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:20,089
ALL ABOUT HIM, NOT THE FACT THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SEARCH FOOGGO

157
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,257
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SEARCH FOOGGO AND GET ALL KINDS OF

158
