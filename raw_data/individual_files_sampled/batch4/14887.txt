Azra I'm not surprised but I'm infuriated and I think a lot of my rage goes to any female prisoners that now have to be bunk mates with a fully functioning male both in strength and in terms of genitalia and also not the bureaucrats at Corrections Canada who don't do the heavy lifting the prison guards that now have to you know accommodate this I mean why are we going down this road in the first place yeah one of the things that I found most distressing is that these prisoners can now choose if they want a male or a female prison guard to strip-search them a male or a female prison guard to surveil them and I mean this is so absurd that I have to do this but let me define four different words for you sex when you're born you're either a boy or a girl that there's there's no spectrum there's no like and it's a science thing it you have X X chromosome or X Y chromosome it's a science so that's sex gender is a word that sort of do you appear female or a peer female so for example what gender is that shirt is that a shirt that a man will wear or a woman would wear it's obviously not genetic it's a it's a cultural fashion thing so there's sex which is immutable there's gender which is how things look but we're so far beyond that here there's gender expression mmm that means how you present yourself to the world and then there's gender identity that's how you think you are in your own mind and can you believe it gender identity is now what they're basing that on and the reason I took you through those four silly well now those four basic definitions is we're not talking about an inmate who actually has his you know wedding tackle cut off and his like like even that to put such a man in with the women would be but what would be wrong we're talking about a guy who simply says I am a woman now yeah it doesn't have to be his genuine belief no means test theirs he doesn't have to like you could just simply say I identify as a woman today and therefore and and here's my point it it's not an immutable characteristic I'm not even talking about if someone's gay or not yeah I'm talking about someone just saying I am a woman today therefore transfer me to the women's facility I want to be strip searched by a woman oh and and I'm not gonna even speak in a high voice or shave myself or put on lipstick I'm just telling you I'm a woman and I demand this entire justice and and correctional system to jump and who are we talking about here David we were talking about the 4,800 hard-core murderers and rapists that are serving life sentences in canada we're not talking about some confused young team you might be going we're talking about the paul Barnardo's to give criminals the right to say i want to be in with the girls is insane hey that was an excerpt from my weekly show rebel roundup in which we highlight the best stories of the week with your favorite rebels if you want to see the full show please sign up to become a Premium Member you
