WELCOME. IF YOU'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THE NEWS RECENTLY, MANY OF THE BIG STORIES REVOLVE AROUND QUESTIONS OF RACE. INCREASINGLY IN THIS COUNTRY RACE IS THE HEADLINE. JUST THIS WEEK ROSEANNE BARR AND HER SHOW CANCELED ON ABC AFTER TWEETING AN ATTACK ON VALERIE JARRETT THAT MANY DESCRIBED AS RACIST. STARBUCKS, THE COFFEE RETAILER, CLOSED MORE THAN 8,000 RETAIL STORES IN ORDER TO EDUCATE WHITE EMPLOYEES ABOUT THEIR UNCONSCIOUS RACISM. MEANWHILE A BAR IN PORTLAND, HOSTED A REPARATION HOUR, WHERE NONWHITE PATRONS BANK FOR FREE. NONWHITE PATRONS BANK FOR FREE. THE GENTRIFIERS OF TODAY ARE SAYING, OH, THERE'S SO MANY OLIVE GARDENS I CAN GO TO, SO I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE CITY, GET MY LIFE IN THE CITY, BUT I NEED MY HOT YOGA STUDIO, MY POTTERY STUDIO, MY STUFF REPRESENTED. IF YOU INTRUDE ON THAT, I WILL THEN CALL THE POLICE. MORE AND MORE IT FEELS LIKE RACIAL DIVISION IS THE SUBTEXT OF VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING IN THIS COUNTRY, EVEN TOPICS THAT SEEM UNRELATED TO ETHNICITY SUDDENLY ARE RACIALLY FRAUGHT. THE EFFECT IS A DEEPLY ANGRY AND DIVIDED NATION, BUT ALSO YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED A TERRIFIED ONE. MANY AMERICANS ARE SCARED TO SAY JUST ABOUT ANYTHING. ONE FALSE WORD AND YOU COULD BE DENOUNCED ON TWITTER AND LOSE YOUR LIVELIHOOD. IT HAPPENS. WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME. BEST IS TO SMILE AND NOD AND HOPE THE WITCH-HUNT PASSES. HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO LIVE THIS WAY? HOW DID WE GET HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? JOINING US A LAWYER WHO SERVES ON THE U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS, WRITTEN A NEW THRILLER, CALLED "SECOND STRIKE," WHICH I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND IS EXCELLENT. PETER, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE GOING ON. EVEN AS THE COUNTRY BECOMES MUCH MORE DIVERSE, SOMETHING WE WERE PROMISED WOULD MAKE THE COUNTRY MORE HARMONIOUS, THE COUNTRY SEEMS MORE ON EDGE ABOUT QUESTIONS OF RACE. WHAT'S GOING ON? SEVERAL THINGS ARE GOING ON, BUT THE OVERRIDING THING IS A POLITICAL NARRATIVE TO ENHANCE AN ARGUMENT OR ONE PARTICULAR SIDE, AND HAS ITS GENESIS IN TWO THINGS. FIRST IS THE POLITICAL ELECTED CHIEFLY, AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF THIS DIVISION ON THE BASIS OF RACE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS ANYMORE. IF YOU LISTEN VERY CLOSELY, YOU DON'T HEAR ANY WORKABLE POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS, OR VERY FEW WORKABLE POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS, BUT WHAT YOU HEAR A LOT OF IT IS IDENTITY POLITICS. IN 17 YEARS, WE HAVEN'T HAD MORE LUCID CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RACE OR IDENTITY. THEY'VE GOTTEN INCREASINGLY SOPHOMORIC, OPAQUE, DRIVEN BY AN AHISTORICAL NARRATIVE THAT HAS LITTLE BEARING THAT TRULY HAPPENED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. LOOK, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT IN MY LIFETIME MATTERS OF RACE AND DISCRIMINATION HAS GOTTEN DEMONSTRABLY BETTER, IN WAYS THAT WE COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED. IF YOU LOOK AT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS OF VARIOUS RACES TODAY THEY'VE NEVER BEEN BETTER. INDIVIDUALS OF RACES. WHEN YOU COME TO THE INTERACTION BETWEEN GROUPS, IT'S BECOME HOSTILE AND TOXIC, AND IT'S A FUNCTION OF TRYING TO GET CERTAIN GROUPS TO HAVE AN ALLEGIANCE TO A CERTAIN MOVEMENT OR CERTAIN PARTY FOR POLITICAL IMPERATIVE. MAY I STEP IN THERE AND BACK UP FOR A SECOND TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID THAT I NEVER THOUGHT OF. THE CONVERSATION IS INCREASINGLY GENERAL AND LESS SPECIFIC. SO WHEREAS 30 YEARS AGO PEOPLE MIGHT SAY, IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN STANDARD ICED TESTING, WE NEED TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO HEAD START, FOR EXAMPLE. NOW THE CONVERSATION IS THIS GROUP IS BAD, IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN BAD, IT WILL NEVER GET BETTER. WHY ARE WE HEARING FEWER SOLUTIONS THAN WE USED TO HEAR? WELL, I THINK FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. ONE AGAIN IS THAT POLITICAL IMPERATIVE, BECAUSE SOLUTIONS GO AGAINST HAVING A POLITICAL ADVANTAGE. I THINK IT'S ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S A TENDENCY ON THE PART OF SOME TO SHUT DOWN OTHERS, TO CAST OTHERS AS THE OTHER. AGAIN, THAT'S FOR POLITICAL IMPERATIVE. RIGHT. BUT YOU'RE AFRAID TO SAY THINGS THAT ARE DEMONSTRABLY TRUE. TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE HAD A HEARING AT THE U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS, ALL-DAY HEARING, EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD WAS THERE, THE USUAL GROUPS WERE THERE. IT WAS A HEARING ON HATE CRIMES BECAUSE OF THE SPIKE IN HATE CRIMES SINCE TRUMP HAS BEEN ELECTED. BUT FACTS ARE STUBBORN THINGS. WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE DATA, AND WHEN I ASKED QUESTIONS OF THIS, AFTER EVERYONE MADE THESE GRAND PRONOUNCEMENTS ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE AND HORRIFIC THE SPIKE IN HATE CRIMES IS, WE HAD NO HARD EVIDENCE OF SUCH SPIKE. THE BEST DATA ON THIS COMES FROM THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE STATISTICS. WHAT IT'S SHOWN FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS, THERE'S BEEN A DECLINE IN HATE CRIMES. THERE'S BEEN A DECLINE IN ALL MANNER OF DISCRIMINATION FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS. YET WE HAVE GREATER SENSITIVITY, HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY, AND YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF THIS, WHY THIS IS THE CASE. I THINK TO SOME EXTENT IT'S BECAUSE IT HELPS THE AGENDA OF CERTAIN GROUPS OF CERTAIN PARTIES, CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS. SO YOU KEEP HEARING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ON RACE. I'M ALWAYS FOR CONVERSATIONS, PARTICULARLY FOR HONEST ONES. I WONDER AFTER ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS IF THE COUNTRY IS BECOMING MORE DIVIDED. MAYBE THAT'S EVIDENCE IT'S NOT WORKING. DO WE NEED TO TALK LESS ABOUT RACE OR MORE ABOUT RACE? DOES THE CONVERSATION IDEA HOLD UP TO SCRUTINY? TWO THINGS. TUCKER, I DISAGREE WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS. WE ALWAYS HEAR WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION, BUT WHAT WE GET IS ALWAYS HARANGUES, COMING FROM ONE SIDE, AND MOST DECENT PEOPLE DUCK THEIR HEADS AND WATCH FOR INCOMING FIRE. THEY DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT IN CROSSFIRE. YOU KNOW IF YOU GO TO COLLEGES, LAW SCHOOLS, ALMOST ANY INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING, FRANKLY K-12, THERE ARE ONLY CERTAIN ACCEPTABLE OPINIONS THEY CAN HAVE, AND STUDENTS ARE PUNISHED FOR THIS, AND THEY KNOW HOW TO REACT IN THE CONTEXT OF A CLASSROOM DEBATE OSTENSIBLY ON RACE. THERE'S ONLY ONE ACCEPTABLE OPINION, AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO OFFER OTHER OPINIONS. THAT DOESN'T FURTHER THE CONVERSATION. ONE OTHER POINT NO. IT DOESN'T HELP ANYBODY. I CAN SEE WHY THEY TRY TO SHUT
