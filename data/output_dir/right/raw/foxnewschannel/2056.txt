VERY ISSUE WARNS IT OFFERS THE

14
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:28,753
FEWEST DISADVANTAGES.

MR. SECRETARY, MAKE YOUR CASE BY

20
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,528
STAYING IN THIS DEAL, THAT YOU

21
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:38,763
EVEN TOLD US IS FLAWED.

22
00:00:38,763 --> 00:00:39,697
>> IT IS.

23
00:00:39,697 --> 00:00:41,632
OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT

24
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:44,035
TO SEE FLAWS IN IT.

25
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:45,636
HE SET A VERY REASONABLE

26
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:46,471
CHALLENGE TO THE WORLD.

27
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,706
LOOK, IRAN IS BEHAVING BADLY.

28
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:54,879
IRAN HAS A TENDENCY TO DEVELOP

29
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,513
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC

30
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:55,880
MISSILES.

31
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,982
WE HAVE TO PUSH BACK WHAT IRAN

32
00:00:57,982 --> 00:00:59,283
IS DOING IN THE REGION.

33
00:00:59,283 --> 00:01:00,852
WE HAVE TO BE TOUGHER ON IRAN.

34
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,386
WE HAVE TO FIX THE FLAWS IN THE

35
00:01:02,386 --> 00:01:02,820
DEAL.

36
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,955
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IS

37
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:06,057
THIS SUNSET CLAUSE WHICH MEANS

38
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:09,327
THAT AFTER 2025 IT ALLOWS, THE

39
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:12,363
CURRENT DEAL ALLOWS TO GO

40
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,065
FORWARD FAST WITH ENRICHMENT

41
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:15,466
PROGRAMS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A

42
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:18,035
NUCLEAR WEAPON.

43
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:19,770
NOW, NO SANCTIONS GO BACK ON.

44
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,873
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY OF FIXING

45
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,407
THAT AND THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

46
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:25,443
RIGHT TO CALL ATTENTION TO IT.

47
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:26,911
BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT

48
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:28,846
JUST THROWING THE BABY OUT WITH

49
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:30,815
THE BATH WATER.

50
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:31,682
WITHOUT SCRAPPING THE WHOLE

51
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:31,983
THING.

52
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:33,384
IF YOU DO THAT YOU HAVE TO

53
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,386
ANSWER THE QUESTION, WHAT NEXT?

54
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,823
WHAT IF THE IRANIANS RUSH TO A

55
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:40,224
NUCLEAR WEAPON?

56
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:42,093
ARE WE SERIOUSLY SAYING THAT

57
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:48,165
WE'LL BOMB THE FACILITIES AT

58
00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:51,569
FORDA AND NATANZ?

59
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,471
OR WE WORK WITH WHAT WE GOT AND

60
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:53,838
PUSH BACK.

61
00:01:53,838 --> 00:01:55,573

HE DOESN'T LIKE THE DEAL BUT

65
00:01:59,143 --> 00:02:00,545
WHAT REPLACES IT.

66
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:03,247

TOGETHER WITH YOUR CONCERNS AND

70
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:08,786
PUT AN OVERLAY ON IT?

71
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:10,454
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS, IRAN

72
00:02:10,454 --> 00:02:12,223
DOES NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING.

73
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:13,591
IRAN SIGHS I'M STICKING STICKIN

00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:13,624

THIS DEAL.

77
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,494
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A NEW

78
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:16,794
DEAL.

79
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:17,728
>> THAT IS RIGHT.

80
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,596
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

81
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,332
SO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO, YOU'VE

82
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:23,568
GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE HEART

83
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:26,437
OF THE OLD DEAL, THE EXISTING

84
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:30,107
DEAL IS THAT IT GIVES IRAN SOME

85
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:32,276
REASON TO HOPE THAT THEY WILL

86
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:33,978
HAVE ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN THE

87
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:34,845
LONG RUN.

88
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:36,113
ACTUALLY THEY HAVEN'T HAD MUCH

89
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:38,382
IN THE LAST FEW YEAR.

90
00:02:38,382 --> 00:02:40,685
IN RETURN FOR WHICH THEY DON'T

91
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:42,086
EQUIP THEMSELVES WITH A NUCLEAR

92
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:42,486
WEAPON.

93
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:45,489
LET ME JUST REMIND YOU IF THEY

94
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:47,491
DO GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON YOU WILL

95
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:48,459
GET AN ARMS RACE IN THE

96
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:48,859
MIDDLE EAST.
