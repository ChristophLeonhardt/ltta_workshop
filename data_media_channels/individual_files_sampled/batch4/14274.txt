Greyhound is closing down because the government made doing business in Canada just a little too expensive but that is not stopping environment and climate change Canada from starting up their own shuttle bus service you will not believe the hypocritical way Environment Minister Catherine McKenna wants to spend your money now according to this a federal government request for tender environment and climate change Canada and the National Capital Region require the services of shuttle bus drivers to supplement existing department capacity to transport environment and climate change Canada and other federal government employees to and from their respective offices using Environment Canada supplied vehicles now we got our hot little hands on the longer procurement document that lays out exactly what the federal government would like to purchase from the private sector to shuttle buses will operate for nine and a half hours per day on an ongoing basis one van and one larger 15 passenger van fuel will be paid for by environment and climate change Canada now here on page 28 the government says they want these vans to run every 10 minutes between two Gatineau addresses every 10 minutes whether there are people in them or not back and forth and back and forth and back and forth all day long for 251 days per year in fact now I did the math at 9 and a half hours per day each van is making 57 trips per day and there are two vans that's a hundred and fourteen trips per day but wait the contract is 250 days long that's nearly 29,000 trips they're rolling a lot of coal for a department whose job it is to keep the rest of us off fossil fuels won't someone think of the earth or something and those two Gatineau addresses well they're approximately four kilometres apart that's a leisurely bike ride when you need to make the trip but to drive it religious every ten minutes well that works out to be one hundred eleven thousand five hundred kilometers and way down here on page 32 of those very same documents we find out the shuttle buses use gasoline under number six Environment Canada shuttle driving directives make sure your shuttle is filled with gasoline before leaving for the day especially when leaving it for a co-worker to use for a shame environment and climate change Canada you didn't even think about electric or hybrid vans before you created your own private shuttle service that runs every ten minutes and here I thought making sure everybody was forced to take the low-carbon option was a Catherine McKenna directive Environment Minister Catherine McKenna keeps telling us that we need to move to a low-carbon future and yet she's ordering gasoline-powered shuttle buses to run every ten minutes between two really close GATS new offices and those buses will run whether they are empty or not I guess McKenna really didn't mean all those photos of her pretending to ride a bike in a dress and high heels to and from work now did she I mean we all knew at the time those photos were staged but I guess here's the proof and I guess Catherine McKenna really really doesn't think that fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions are going to kill all of us and and life as we know it because she doesn't seem to be taking her own vehicle use all that seriously now does she see she's certainly not treating cars as the catastrophic poison emitters she tells us they are and this is vehicular use that is completely under Catherine McKenna's control McKenna needs fossil fuels just as much as the rest of us do to get back and forth to work actually it sounds like McKenna needs them a little more than a normal person what was the twenty nine thousand trips in nine months and all looks to me like environment and climate change runs on gasoline and a lot of it it's fall to both the environment and the economy according to McKenna for her to spend millions of dollars on a vanity bus shuttle service that spews tons of co2 into the environment if you care about those sorts of things and I hear Catherine McKenna does she keeps telling me that she does she actually won't shut up about it Catherine because Vanguard should really be the one setting the example and bike and walk and take public transportation with the rest of us peasants in another investigation we did here at the rebel we discovered that the federal government already has electric car charging stations literally all over the place and they don't get used at all and others get used very very minimally does anybody really think this new program is going to be any more utilized than that electric car charger program I certainly don't think so so I've got a petition that I'd love for you to sign against Catherine McKenna's political perk that's according to her bad for both the economy and the environment that's again according to her and not me for me I think this political perk is bad for my tax bill and it's hypocritical it's typical progressive do as I say not as I do baloney go to Carbon catherine com2 sign my petition calling on Catherine McKenna to put a stop to her carbon intensive shuttle bus program and lead the way by asking her employees to ride their bikes walk or take the bus to and from their offices that's carbon Kathryn comm it's time for the Liberals to live the way they are asking us to for the Rebelde media I'm Sheila Gunn read environment and climate change Minister Catherine McKenna wants her own private shuttle bus service I say it's time for her to live like how she wants the rest of us to she can walk she can ride her bike or she can take public transportation like the rest of us to sign my petition to Environment Minister Catherine McKenna go to Carbon Catherine calm
