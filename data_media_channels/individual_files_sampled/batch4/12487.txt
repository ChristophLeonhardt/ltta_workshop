you know for years the right has been complaining about the culture Andrew Breitbart used to say politics is downstream from culture and that is absolutely true just about everything you see that's happening started 20 years ago with the culture but now Donald Trump a figure created by the culture is actually fighting a war for the culture fighting back for the right in the culture and the right has suddenly left the building conservative film critic Christian Toto of Hollywood in toto will be here just to discuss it all with me but first every now and again I like to do my little part to bring our divided country together by building bridges between conservatives like myself and the Communist jerk weeds on the other side today and that spirit of bright goodwill I'd like to examine some of the major issues from both political perspectives the right and the one with all the knuckleheads let's start with health care reform we on the right believe it's inherently dangerous to put government in control of health care the tragic problems at the VA are proof we think it violates the freedom of medical personnel to require them to work for government determine wages and we think it strips freedom-loving Americans of the right and responsibility to decide how to take care of themselves on the Left they believe it was so sad when Jimmy Kimmel cried because he's so funny when he pretends to feud with Matt Damon and Jimmy and matters so cool and Donald Trump is so mean that we should just make everything free like they do in Scandinavia or someplace so those are the healthcare arguments but what about the issue of climate change we on the right believe a conscious care for our environment needn't involve hysterical government overreach or business killing regulations capitalist innovation and public education have made great strides in reducing harmful emissions and there's no reason to socialize a major sector of the energy economy because a group of consistently unreliable computer models predict disaster and a left-wing media spreads panic in order to allow the government to seize even more power on the Left they believe that 97% someone or other says that Al Gore is right and the world is going to end three years ago and even if the Paris Accord does nothing it shows how virtuous we are so yay Obama and anyone who doesn't believe that started the Holocaust so that's climate change on the subject of free speech the right believes free speech is the central pillar of Liberty and must be protected even at the cost of hearing things we don't like the left believe shut up shut up shut up and puts its fingers in its ears and whistles Dixie and then says Dixie is racist and then hits you with a stick so I think we're beginning to see that when we compare right-wing arguments to left-wing arguments it helps to unite us all in ridiculing left-wing arguments and isn't that what America is all about god I hope so trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show stop the hammering I'm sorry we should be get a little excited here we have to calm down we need a little some of that single nostril breathing I think but you know

comm slash Cleveland alright so you know there's news today I mean there's there's all kinds of breaking news the North Korean Foreign Minister declared that we are at war with them they said he's read one of trumps tweets saying they're not gonna be around for long and he decided that was a declaration of war and they now have the right to shoot our aircraft out of the sky I did try that that's gonna end really really well for North Korea you now when you fly over North Korea at night it's dark because they don't have electricity because they all they put all their energy into this stupid dictator if they do that you'll go over and just be a flaming red hole where North Korea and the healthcare bill the gram Cassidy bill it looks like it may be doomed Rand Paul John McCain and Susan Collins are all against it right now so that's gonna be a hard thing to pass why do I want to go back to the NFL for a couple of seconds I have to go back to the NFL and I will tell you why I mean first let's just catch up the NFL controversy kind of extended a little bit there was Monday Night Football which I didn't watch because these creeps keep disrespecting the flag but the Dallas Dallas Cowboys came out and they knelt before the national anthem and then Anvik audience booed and then they stood up for the national anthem which fine I'm fine with that you know in other words they were saying we have the team we're unified together but we respect the flag fine there's all little Complex at this point but it's mine the one that was kind of weird was Alejandro Villanueva who was the one of the veteran Steeler a bump sir he was a veteran his Army Ranger with three tours overseas and he was the Pittsburgh Steeler who came out alone and saluted the flag he apologized and what he said was that the idea was the Steelers were gonna stand just with in the locker room gateway and they were gonna salute the flag in there but he walked out ahead of them by mistake and it now became his famous picture of him standing alone saluting the flag those veterans saluting the flag his jersey became the most popular jersey and now he comes out and apologizes listen to this I've made coach Tomlin look bad and and that is my fault and that is my fault only I've made my teammates look bad and that is my fault and my fault only and I made the Steelers also look bad and that is my fault and my fault only so unwillingly I have I've made a mistake and so you know I've talked to my teammates about the situation hopefully they understand it if they don't I still have to live with because the nature of this debate is is is causing a lot of very heated reactions from from fans from players and and it's undeserving to all the players and coaches from his organization so I mean some people said oh he must have been bullied into doing this I'm how do you bully an Army Ranger who was like an offensive lineman you know like what's exactly what's the technique there now I think he felt like probably he's telling the truth probably he didn't mean it to come out like that but the very fact that it made them look bad should tell them something the very fact that he made them look bad by standing there even if he did it accidentally should tell them something well it obviously the left knows the left knows they have been caught with their foot in the ring earlier because because Trump does this over and over again he takes a popular opinion he says he he pronounces it he speaks for it in the most garish violent way possible the left ovary acts and they wind up supporting Kim Jong hoon and dissing the flag and they know they got caught they know they got caught so now they're going to the race card play the race card it's all about the race card here is you got here this this is perfect Wolf Blitzer talking to Cornell Brooke of the n-double a-c-p and Blitzer was doing this all day long with every guest he had especially if the guest was black okay he's he said he's the setup question this t-ball question call Trump a racist here it is oh the sub morning the president tweeted this and I'll put it up on the screen the issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race it is about respect for our country flag and national anthem NFL must respect this what's your response to that Cornell the breath unfortunately it pains me to say this that the president's tweets and comments had nothing to do with the flag and everything to do with race when the president refers to Colin Kaepernick in Alabama as a son of the B word is Rachel Cove for the N word across America and in Alabama and this I just play this as a sample this is all over the news it's all about races all and this is what the left does it's always about race and there now they put this in their their backpack and they carry it around so anytime they mentioned Donald Trump it's going to be about race Hillary Clinton tied it and she was not alone in doing this she tied it to the Charlottesville thing she well listen to what she says olan he attacks black athletes as he did starting with his rally in Alabama continued on Twitter and he attacks them for protesting peacefully for equality for standing up for what they believe and he does it once again to dog-whistle to his base and to try to detract attention from other things that are going on but it's quite telling that he is willing to attack black athletes he never says anything of an insulting manner toward white supremacist or neo-nazis or Ku Klux Klan errs or Vladimir Putin right you know she looks a little tense she could probably use some single nostril breathing but you know you do hold and you breathe through one and you hold it and then you exhale through the other and you keep going he's like a convict you know they say about your guards say about convicts how do you know in a convict is lying his mouth is moving that's like all this stuff you know he never attacks you know Trump never attacks white supremacy he does again and again and again he never said there were good people among the white supremacist and all this stuff the point the point I'm making here is the left knows this matters the left knows this is where American culture is fought it is fought on reality TV it's fought on television as well in the movies it's fought in sports this is the culture now here's the thing I've been fighting this fight now I don't know it's got to be 15 years when I suddenly noticed that the culture was where all this stuff takes place and I would go and make speeches and I used to describe it I used to say it was like telling my wife that when you buy something on sale it still cost money and when you say that to my wife she looks at you like you're a cute guy and I know something is coming out of your mouth but I have got no idea what you're talking about that's when you talk to conservatives about the culture that's what it's like I come on and I make jokes and I do an opening routine sometimes you go onto Facebook the comments are coming in why is he making jokes why is he being show us things are serious why isn't you know and then they think like well why don't we have a daily show why isn't there a conservative debt that's why that's why you're not laughing that is why and they say like why is there sex and violence and TV in movies because movies and TV are about sex and violence that's what stories are about watch the operas watch Shakespeare that's what it's about you're not gonna win any points I got nothing against like happy-go-lucky Christian films although they seem to me to have nothing to do with Christianity but that's that's fine you want to make those movies go ahead but you know the culture is violent the cultured art is violent from the iliad on it's violent it's sexy it's got all this stuff if you're gonna talk to people in the words in the in terms of culture you got to talk to him like that and this is the thing you know I remember I was invited honored to be invited to Laura Bush's one of Laura Bush's book things right and I got up and gave a reading a big tent and you're on the Washington Mall and I got up and gave a reading from my book Empire of Lies which has basically turned me from a guy who got 300 got reviewed in like 300 venues to a guy who got reviewed in one venue you know the minute I wrote this book I knew boy oh boy this is gonna I'm gonna take a hit for this because as a conservative hero a conservative Christian hero and openly conservative politically conservative Christian hero so I just read some of the book and afterwards they had questions and the first question I got was how does it feel when you have to embody a character like this why do you know is it awful the as I said it's just feel and I said I love the guy I love the guy and the woman looked at me like she had no idea what you know what I was talking about I went and saw this picture over the weekend Logan lucky and it's just a heist movie featuring hillbillies and by Steven Soderbergh who made the Ocean's eleven of the story and he said you know he read hillbilly elegy a really good book about hillbillies and all this stuff and so he just wanted to make a movie about it the movie is fun it's a fun heist movie but there's no reno theme no point no purpose he just wanted to see these people that he never knew existed doesn't understand and even in the movie they can only deal with them in terms of their dysfunction in terms of their being unemployed in terms of their being not well educated in terms of them living in trailers not that they're not sympathetic characters it's just that's the only way he can deal with them you know so so what I'm saying is this is the fight for the culture Donald Trump is fighting the fight for the culture and you know people I'm not even gonna name them because I like them conservatives I like and respect and whose ideas I respect and whose personality and lives I respect are saying like why is he doing this this is dumb why is he doing this well he's doing it this is where the fight takes place 20 years from now it's gonna matter whether we believe the fight over the national anthem is a fight over whether we believe that America is a country like all countries with problems that can be fixed through the American Way or we believe America is irredeemable that America is the problem right like Barack Obama was always scolding America you know it's not that it's not that we who are consider ourselves patriotic think America is perfect nobody wins dumb nobody thinks America is perfect it's got people in it you can have a perfect country you have a country with people in it you can't have both but this is the question the question that is being asked is do we honor our country and solve our problems as Americans through the American Way or is the country itself the problems the country itself a white supremacist evil slave based country right that's the that's the question Trump is actually fighting that issue in his own belligerent and I you know I'm not the biggest Donald Trump fan I don't even like the guy personally that much but he's doing what Trump does he is a different kind of president and he's doing this thing and I'll get back and talk about show you how some of this is really important but first we have

solved I mean pretty cheap all right we got we got Christian todo coming up but first I just want to continue this thought for just a minute before we go over there you know there's this fight in Alabama for the guy who's going to replace Jeff Sessions who's now the Attorney General so they need somebody to replace Jeff Sessions in the Senate and two Republicans Luther strange is that yeah Luther strange a judge Roy Moore are fighting for this and it's weird because Roy Moore is considered the more trumpian candidate where Moore is the guy remember he was thrown off the the bench he was a judge top judge and he was thrown off the bench because he wouldn't remove even after a federal order he wouldn't remove the Ten Commandments from the courthouse just stupid thing to order in the first place but he wouldn't do it then he got back his judgeship and he was thrown off again because he wouldn't sanction gay marriage even after the feds said you had to sanction gay marriage so the weird thing about this is Trump is supporting the guy he calls big Luther because Luther Strange who is the Mitch McConnell candidate he's kind of the establishment candidate all the old Trump ian's like Steve Bannon are down there fighting for Roy Moore they're fighting for him because they think he is the insurgent so this is the vote is going on today and then the question is of course if Roy Moore gets it because remoras ahead in the polls will he beat the Democrat doug jones and there's all kinds of local stuff here because Luther strange was investigating he was the I can't remember the Attorney General he was investigating the governor the governor had this big scandal because he had an affair and he started doing favors for his mistress and all this stuff and so he was an unskilled I who was investigating him to the Senate to fill in Jeff Sessions so he's kind of tainted so that may be skewing this as well I just want to play you a couple of cuts of this guy Roy Moore because you do not hear people like this in the mainstream at all this is judge Roy Moore cut number eight talking at a a rally yesterday before the vote today we've forgotten the gracious hand preserved us in peace and multiplied enriched and strengthened and veinly imagined in the deceitfulness of Rouen hearts that all of these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of her own intoxicating the unbroken success we've become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace too proud to pray to the God who made us we've got to go back to God we've got to go back to kill more faith now you don't hear that kind of speech in Washington DC you don't hear it on the mainstream media it's the thing that gets made fun of in the movies that guy if this guy's a character in the movies he makes fun of it and you want to see something that really had to live the Liberals hair on fire he then goes on and talked about the fact that he was accused of not supporting the Second Amendment watch this if you're watching you got to see this if you don't I'll describe it afterwards good very hard for my wife and myself to Wizard to nearly three months of negative ads that we couldn't answer with money because we didn't have it a heads it was completely false and I don't believe in the Second Amendment I believe in the second he pulls a gun it's pocket he's given a politician giving his speech for the Senate I mean there's something so American about that you know you can see that happening like an 1872 terrific moment all I'm saying here is these people the people he's speaking to are forgotten they're forgotten on the East Coast that forgotten in the movies they're forgotten on TV there's no comedian on TV speaking to them they're forgotten in this spot when the guy goes out and this is the flag what do you think those people are thinking about him they are forgotten and we don't speak formally the intellectual right doesn't speak for him the the right who is so horrified by Donald Trump and listen I'm part of that you know I am part of that group I look at Donald Trump and there's something about him that goes up my spine these you know he's born she's bullying and all this stuff but he is speaking for those people and those people are part of our base and part of our movement and they deserve a piece of the culture and he is giving it to them and I just think that matters let's bring on Christian Toto and talk about this more Christian toto is a friend he's an award-winning journalist film critic and podcaster he's the founder of Hollywood in Toto comm one of the only places where you can read about the movies from a right-wing perspective from a guy who actually knows something about the movies I mean right-wingers are always writing about the movies but they don't really know anything about the movies you can find him on Twitter at Hollywood in Toto tio tio at Hollywood in total how you doing Christians good to see it I'm great oh good to see you yeah I want to have some those steaks if you can I know they're so good you wrote a piece recently in which they'd actually had me in it where you asked about boycotting whether it's right to boycott films let's be being why did you write the piece what brought that into your mind at the time it was before Trump talked about boycotting the NFL yeah you know it's something that I never would have imagined writing two years ago or maybe even one year ago but it's like that the landscape is changing and shifting and I think that for years Hollywood conservatives have been basically fighting like the the Marquis of Queensbury rules where we're all kind of doing this and following with the rules and doing what we're supposed to do and the other side is is slinging mud and kicking our shins and rabbit punching us and I get the sense that people are just fed up you know I Kurt Schlichter is a guy on Twitter who's often just really aggressive and hardcore and I think in the past I would say Oh tone it down Kurt you're a great guy I love you now I'm almost cheering him on when he kind of goes on his diatribes and I I just think that we can't keep playing the same way we've been on the right and so I want to reach out to a bunch of prominent people like yourself to find out what they're thinking and and I got a variety of responses but again I don't think those responses would be the same as maybe a year ago I think people understand there's something significant going on in the culture and the same-old same-old is not working it's not changing things it's not helping our cause and that's that's why I wanted to investigate you know I mean I when I read the piece I'm in it and been Shapiro's in it I think Kurt isn't it - and and you know we all have I think this reluctance I know I do I mean I don't I'm a I'm a political person but I'm also a novelist I've written films most of my novels are I won't call them a political but they're thriller novels they're meant to be entertaining and you know gripping and all this stuff and I would hate to have you know I have been hate bombed by people where they put bad reviews up for you on Amazon and all this stuff and it does seem unfair to me and I'd hate to respond to them this way but and I this is the big but when I look at the landscape and I see no late-night comedians who are on the right when I see no movies that are on the right when I see nobody stand up at the Emmys or the Oscars and say hey let's give the whole Trump a chance you know stop dissing your audience all the time it changes your mind I mean I think that at least a boycott is some kind of cultural statement isn't it yeah you know I almost think you could just do the opposite and just say hey you know Dwayne Johnson doesn't shove his politics in my face Kevin Hart doesn't do that Jeff Bridges is kind of magnanimous when it comes to Donald Trump maybe I support there maybe it's sort of a reverse move where you put more attend more more dollars into their coffers and say hey I like them I like their approach I'm gonna do it because I think what we've seen over the weekend with the NFL is we're exhausted where everything is political where we have no escape there is no more way to kind of just check out and put the politics aside and say hey I want to watch a football game I want to watch the x-files but now I've got David Duchovny on a knee sharing a video of a picture of that on Instagram and social media I'm exhausted my fellow conservatives are exhausted we need a break and the fact that all the powers that be don't realize that it staggers me well I think I think it's indicative of two different attitudes the the right feels that the arts sports and and the culture should be somehow above politics at some level but the left feels like no no no you know every minute of every day you need to be reminded that America is racist you're a racist you're a homophobic every day I mean I you know I started to watch Stephen King and I'm a big King fan I started to watch Stephen King's the mist and and in the first five minutes there were like three lectures on tolerance to a transgender you know gay people and and by the way I feel quite very tolerant toward gay people certainly and you know I'm not I'm not opposed to people being transgendered I just don't want to be lectured I just want to see a monster in the mist kill somebody you know so it's like you say you say we are weary of it but they never stop no and and lecture is the opposite of entertainment that's right it takes you out of this situation it puts you in a different place and it's not storytelling I mean at the core of it you know I always refer to Jerry Romero from Dawn of the Dead he wanted to comment about consumerism and he's got zombies lurking in it in a mall and there wasn't a speech it was a visual and you could take away oh look there's zombies in the mall or think boy that's just like my uncle and a hint when they're kind of you know walking through the mall looking for something to buy bored I mean it let the viewer make the interpretation where they can sort of dictate how they wanted to appreciate it and it works on multiple levels and I think that's smart and I have no problem with that and I have no problem with an actor saying I want to vote for Hillary or Obama it's the lecture it's the it's the condescension and it's the hate and we're seeing a lot of hate right now no question did you see Logan lucky I did I was I was amused by it I I think I expected more getting the cast and given the talent behind the scenes you know Soderbergh basically said that he just suddenly realized that these people exists and he basically you know remade Ocean's eleven with them in it you know with Hillbillies in it do you think Trump is causing any kind of awakening at all I mean I notice on TV SEAL team is coming on and there's some things about you know more military shows I know that some of the people on these shows I know personally are left wingers but still they're you know I mean at least they're paying tribute to the military paying tribute to America you assume a show about SEAL team it's gonna have some patriotism in it do you think Trump has caused any kind of awakening with these folks at all if it is it's minor there were some lip service paid to that the head of it ABC mentioned you know we need to respect the election look at our programming and see who we are addressing who's the subject of our stories but I haven't seen much synth in and actually once that person said that they went out and canceled Last Man Standing one of the few shows with Tim Allen that spoke to another side of America so I don't think so I think the hatred is all-consuming and where you've got people who are genuinely talented and who could do the right thing or at least tell stories that are more inclusive they're shutting down their the tantrum we're seeing from Hollywood has not abated it in fact it may be getting stronger so yeah I think that was a great opportunity to say hey let us reevaluate let us look at our programming in ourselves and the stories were telling and you know I'll give I don't think that Logan lucky is a good film or a great film but at least he had that wherewithal to say there are more people that are unlike me out there I'm going to address them I'm gonna treat them with a modicum of respect and I'm gonna branch out my storytelling and so a for effort even if the movies not a classic yeah and I could I could hear like I could hear liberals on podcasts kind of saying why why did he make this why are these people there you know why yet and you know it has NASCAR in it and all these things and I thought I thought like yeah a NASCAR fan could go to this movie and enjoy people that he maybe you know who maybe live around him watch them kind of rip off the man it's kind of fun and in some way he's yeah you know we I always feel that conservatives are in this defensive posture with the culture they make the movies the left makes the movies left what makes the TV shows the left writes the novels and publishes the novels we criticize we say oh that's not good that's where can how do you feel I mean I have ideas on this myself but how do you feel we can start to make a contribution besides attacking and boycotting them well I think we do it in part on social media because it takes regular citizens to fight back and to expose the hypocrisy in lies and I think that that's done I mean I give my fellow conservatives a lot of credit I think what they do on social media is outstanding and I think it holds people to account for what they say but we're still I mean you and I had this conversation every every year or two we're still not saying the influx of programming the content and you know the bar for programming is so low now where you can have a YouTube channel you could have a small indie film made for a half a million dollars I mean I think that's where we have to kind of start making inroads you know it's not gonna be a hundred million dollar big-budget film we don't have that capacity yet but we do have the capacity to make smaller films to make documentaries and work our way into the into the space and I think that's the steps that need to be taken and I think there are some moments there and some some feints but we're not there yet yeah that's really I mean when I see the reaction to Trump on the football thing and the right saying why is he doing this why you know my I feel like the Joker and Batman why so serious you know this is this is where the this is the field to play this is where the culture takes place Christian Toto go to Hollywood in toto dot-com you know we need these voices we need voices like yours Christian and people have to come off come and see what you're doing at Hollywood in toto calm or find him on Twitter at Hollywood in Toto tio tio Christian we'll talk to you again soon oh thanks so much thanks a lot like let me let me just go back for a minute to the health care thing that's happening okay john mccain comes out and he says i can't support this is this is this graham cassidy thing and it's not perfect i'm not saying it is it's some kind of strike back it moves some of the funding out to the states a little bit more federalism and all this stuff john mccain comes out and he says i can't support this because it's not bipartisan now you tell me i'm an imaginative guy i can't imagine a buy some bipartisan solution to this the left isn't gonna go for anything so basically I actually suspect deep down that John McCain is just sticking it to Donald Trump he doesn't want him to do anything you know and he just is giving it to him they bring John McCain on 60 minutes first take a look at Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel has been crusading for this he doesn't do a monologue anymore he just gets up there and he just lectures people and hammers people and this is and he's allowed you know it's like the network doesn't say to him Jimmy you know be funny we hired you to be funny be funny he is allowed to use their air which is public air it is regulated by the FCC at his public air he is allowed to use this to push his agenda here's his reaction to news that this graham Cassidy may die I went on TV I spoke out and we may have stopped Cassidy grim I still can't believe we pulled it off but we did it's amazing isn't it patting himself on the back teaching his audience to applaud you know it's like that it's the it's like they're training monkeys they are training monkeys to be left-wing McCain then goes on 60 minutes I they call it an interview it was more like a sex act I mean I'm not gonna get explicit but Lesley Stahl I mean was all over this guy and listen to McCain who loves this he lives for this he lives to see himself praised in the New York Times a former newspaper on CBS my god and listen to him creating his character for Lesley Stahl I don't know what he's gonna do to so or say tomorrow he changes his statements almost on a daily basis so for me to spend my time trying to analyze what he says I don't know did he ever apologize for saying you're not a hero no if the president wanted to have a rough proche mom with you would you be receptive of course of course I've supported him on national security as a personal friend a man sure I'd be glad to converse with him but I also understand that we're very different people different upbringing different life experiences what do you mean by that and what what does it make you think about he is in the business of making money and he has been successful both on television as well as Miss America and others I raised in a military family I was raised in the concept and belief that duty honor country is the is the lodestar for the behavior that we have to exhibit every single day you know if I were in a political fight and I heard the words coming out of my mouth well he makes money and I'm for honor and duty and country I would ask myself am I just kidding myself I mean we're all we're all like you know coming from someplace we all have personal things that we're doing but this idea that he that McCain just loves to go on CBS and portray himself as being for honor duty and country where evil Donald Trump is for just for making money you know just for making money a lot of good has been done in this country by people who make money and a lot of bad has been done by people who conceive of themselves as the emblems of Honor duty and country my point is only this McCain is playing to the culture McCain is a creation of the culture McCain is a creature of the culture and Trump knows how to fight back Trump fought back by tweeting this montage of McCain during his campaigns repeal and replace Obamacare and repeal and replace Obamacare with all this euphoria that's going on it's inside the beltway champagne toasting and all that outside the Beltway the American people are very angry and they don't like it and they're gonna and we're going to try to repeal this and we are going to have a very spirited campaign coming up between now and November and there will be a very heavy price to pay for it also the first time that on a pure partisan basis a major piece of legislation has been passed and it's gonna be historic because it's going to be repealed every place you need to have a vote on it because we promised the people we would you know I told you yesterday I get attacked from every side you can go on my blog you can even go on the comments for this show and you will see people calling me a trump supporter you'll see them calling me anti Trump you will see them calling me a secret liberal you'll see bentham calling me a right-wing fascist I get it from every single side and I you know I have all kinds of reservations and misgivings about Donald Trump but the one thing that I appreciate about him is that he has that he is a voice for people whose voice has been stripped away but a voice for people who have lost every access to mainstream communications and I think we have to give him credit for that and we have to give him credit and at least listen even if you don't like Trump even if you don't like Donald Trump you got to listen to the people that he was that who sent him to Washington because they're us they're part of America you know we listen you know all these all these ballplayers keep saying we have no other way to make a protest there on national TV they're on national TV being watched by tens of millions of people you know a guy in in his home a factory worker an out-of-work guy he has no audience he has no audience Donald Trump has his audience and Donald Trump is speaking in his voice and we ought to listen and we ought to not make fun of him when he's doing it because he's doing it for a reason sexual follies just thing where he falls off this she falls off the end all right here is a in the New York Times which you may have heard used to be a newspaper right marriage which used to be the default way to form a family in the United States regardless of income or education has become yet another part of American life reserved for those who are most privileged now let's think about that for a minute is marriage reserved for those who are most privileged is that a truth is that a true story I mean is it is there something if you show up at up Justice of the Peace and say this is my girlfriend I'd like to marry her does he say ah you know you just want to rest you just not you don't have that thing I don't like your accent you know you don't have enough money I mean what does it cost to get married 50 bucks you know I don't know this is that's an amazing lead okay so it's a question of privilege you now have to feel guilty about being married okay fewer Americans are marrying overall and whether they do so is more tied to socioeconomic status than ever before in recent years marriage has sharply declined among people without college degrees while staying steady among college graduates with higher incomes this is just reaching the New York Times we all knew this before but is just reaching them currently 26 percent of poor adults 39% of working-class adults and 56% of middle and upper-class adults ages 18 to 55 are married according to a research brief published from two think-tanks the American Enterprise Institute and opportunity America when thinking about how to make families more statement in other words after the 60s what happened to us after the 60s we were told you know marriage was no good the family was no good the suburbs were no good America was no good and all this stuff as always with these elite things these come from the top they come from the people who were raised in suburbs were raised by nice families and all this and they rebel and they make these speeches and the press picks it up and the poor follow them the poor follow these this advice and gets screwed and the rich say yeah you know what that wasn't such a good idea and they start to get married again the rich go to church the rich work hard the rich know not to have babies out of wedlock because you know because there they they are the leaders they're the thought leaders but they don't go back and say to the poor oops you know oops we made a mistake now our television shows are gonna tell you that it's good to be married now our TV shows and our spokesman are movie stars are gonna stop getting divorced six times they're gonna start to tell you that it's a good thing to be married they don't correct their errors the article goes on when thinking about how to make families more stable researchers debate whether the decline in marriage is an economic issue or a cultural one those on the Left usually say it's economic and could be reversed if there were more and better jobs for men without college degrees those on the right are more likely to say it's because of a deterioration of cultural values well I've talked about this before the some of this is in fact economic but these guys don't want to admit the cultural side of it because they did it they're guilty it's like it's not it's not the fault of the right that the economy sometimes goes bad it is the fault of the elect that of the left that the culture has gone bad I mean there were stories I just clipped one out 2011 I think this is from the New York Times former newspaper right men who needs them men who needs them the term mammal is based on an objective analysis of shared traits the genus name for human beings Homo reflects an 18th century masculine bias in science that bias however is becoming harder to sustain as men become less relevant to both reproduction and parenting good thinking New York Times you know this is 60 years of men being rundown 60 years of marriage being rundown 60 years of women being told they don't have to know how to make a home they don't have to know how to cook they don't have to bring anything to the marriage all they bring to the marriage is privilege all the men man brings his responsibility funny why aren't people getting married you know why aren't people getting married that it would be another interesting thing to see how many of the upper-class women are actually staying home and taking care of their children which at least makes them valuable to the husband because it means he can go out and provide for them sexual thoughts play that thing again I got to end at least with a laugh nevermind I table so I find it amusing alright the mailbag is tomorrow get your questions in now yeah we can have an actual live
