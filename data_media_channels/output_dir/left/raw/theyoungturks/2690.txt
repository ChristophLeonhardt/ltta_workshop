1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:02,590
WE WERE EXPECTING TO COME IN
TODAY AND TALK ABOUT THE

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,629
THIRD DAY OF THE SHUTDOWN OF
GOVERNMENT, BUT INSTEAD WE

3
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:07,129
HAVE SOMETHING ELSE.

4
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:08,600
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE WORSE.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,940
A DEAL HAS APPARENTLY BEEN
REACHED BETWEEN REPUBLICANS

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,590
AND MOST BUT NOT ALL OF THE
DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE AND

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:21,050
MOST RECENTLY, RIGHT BEFORE WE
WENT LIVE, IN THE HOUSE AS WELL.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,539
BOTH CHUCK SCHUMER WHO WAS
INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS AND

9
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:25,750
MITCH MCCONNELL HAD STATEMENTS.

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,641
MITCH MCCONNELL SAID THIS: I
HOPE AND INTEND THAT WE CAN

11
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:31,720
REACH A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION ON
ISSUES SUCH AS MILITARY

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,789
SPENDING, IMMIGRATION, AND
BORDER SECURITY AND DISASTER

13
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:37,300
RELIEF BEFORE THE FEBRUARY 8 THE
DEADLINE, AND A DEADLINE THEY

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,289
ARE SETTING UP, THEY ARE GOING
TO FUND THE GOVERNMENTAL

15
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,489
UNTIL THEN.

16
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:43,230
HE SAYS SHOULD THESE ISSUES NOT
BE RESOLVED BY THE TIME THE

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,269
FUNDING BILL BEFORE IT EXPIRES,
SO LONG AS THE GOVERNMENT

18
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:49,479
REMAINS OPEN, IT WOULD BE MY
INTENTION TO TAKE UP LEGISLATION

19
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,179
HERE IN THE SENATE THAT WOULD
ADDRESS DACA, BORDER SECURITY

20
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,749
AND RELATED ISSUES.

21
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:55,339
HE
FURTHER PROMISED THAT THE FUTURE

22
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:58,340
IMMIGRATION DEBATE WOULD HAVE A
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WERE

23
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,129
SENATORS FROM BOTH PARTIES COULD
OFFER AMENDMENTS WHICH CERTAINLY

24
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,340
WOULD BE SOMETHING NEW IN THE
SENATE THESE DAYS AND SO

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,890
CHUCK SCHUMER IS GETTING A LOT
OF HEAT OVER THIS.

26
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,520
HE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC AND I KNOW
THAT SOME PEOPLE, I WAS

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,670
LISTENING TO ANGUS KING, EXCITED
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT

28
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,670
THIS COULD WORK OUT IN THE LONG
RUN, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE

29
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,549
ARE INCREDIBLY CRITICAL BECAUSE
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

30
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,479
PILLARS OF THIS IS THAT YOU
NEED TO SORT OF TRUST

31
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,110
MITCH MCCONNELL WHO YOU
SHOULDN'T TRUST ON FAITH

32
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,870
ALONE AND CERTAINLY ON PAST
RECENT EXPERIENCE.

33
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,150
TALK TO SUSAN COLLINS ABOUT HOW
MUCH YOU SHOULD TRUST MITCH

34
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,890
MCCONNELL AND WE ARE BEING ASKED
TO TRUST HIM.

35
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,659
MCCONNELL PROMISED LAST YEAR
FOR VOTES ON HEALTHCARE

36
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,829
WHERE THE DEMOCRATS WOULD BE
ABLE TO DO AMENDMENTS AND

37
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:49,070
IMMIGRATION, STILL WAITING.

38
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,650
LOOK, THE MINUTE SOMEBODY SAYS
MITCH MCCONNELL PROMISES, THE

39
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:58,409
CORRECT ANSWER IS LOL, NOT
LIKE OH, MITCH IS PROMISING IT,

40
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,210
THAT WILL PROBABLY COME TO
FRUITION.

41
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,400
HAVING SAID THAT, THIS DEAL HAS
UPSIDES AND DOWNSIDES.

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,370
YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO HEAR
THAT FROM ME BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS

43
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:16,150
YELLING AT THE DEMOCRATS TO
TOUGHEN UP AND NOT TAKE CONSTANT

44
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,150
COMPROMISES.

45
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,790
THERE IS A LOT OF THAT IN THIS
DEAL, BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME

46
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,430
UPSIDES TOO SO I WANT TO GIVE
YOU BOTH POINTS OF VIEW.

47
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,380
I'M GOING TO LET JOHN CONTINUE
HERE AND THEN WE WILL BREAK

48
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,250
DOWN WHY IT MAKES SENSE AND WHY
IT DOES NOT.

49
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,250
GOOD POINT.

50
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,450
AS I WAS SAYING, A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE PROSPECT

51
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,220
THAT MITCH MCCONNELL'S WORD IS
GOING TO BE SORT OF THE

52
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,390
IMPORTANT PART IN THIS AND THE
NUMBER OF THE SENATORS WHO

53
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,010
VOTED AGAINST IT, PREDOMINANTLY
DEMOCRATS ALTHOUGH THERE

54
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,670
WERE A COUPLE OF REPUBLICANS
BUT IN STATEMENTS, A LOT OF

55
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,190
THEM ECHOING THIS.

56
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,590
ONE AS AN EXAMPLE IS KAMALA
HARRIS WHO SAID:

57
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,190
THE MAJORITY LEADERS COMMENTS
ARE SHORT OF THE IRONCLAD

58
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,780
GUARANTEE.

59
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,180
I REFUSE TO PUT THE LIVES OF
700,000 YOUNG PEOPLE,

60
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,800
REFERRING TO THE DACA PROGRAM,
IN THE HANDS OF SOMEONE WHO HAS

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,110
REPEATEDLY GONE BACK ON HIS
WORD.

62
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,420
YOU CAN FIND SIMILAR
QUOTES LIKE

63
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,220
THAT FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
SENATORS AND WE WANT TO

64
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,411
SHOW YOU THE LIST OF THOSE WHO
DID ACTUALLY VOTE NO ON THIS.

65
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:11,870
THIS IS THE FIRST SET RIGHT
HERE.

66
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,030
IF YOU BRIEFLY THAT GLAZE OVER
THIS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME

67
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,910
STANDOUTS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT OF
EXPECTED BUT THEN SOME THAT, IF

68
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,930
YOU ARE LOOKING AHEAD TO 2020
SORT OF MAKE SENSE OF SOME OF

69
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,570
THEM WERE BE THERE AND IF WE GO
AHEAD, A FEW MORE THERE.

70
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,570
CHRIS MURPHY, NICE.

71
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,360
AND THEN YOU HAVE MIKE LEE AND
RAND PAUL AS WELL BUT

72
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,400
PROBABLY FOR THE NOT FOR THE
RIGHT REASONS.

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON THAT.

74
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,980
LET'S KEEP IT REAL.

75
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,920
1ST OF ALL, ANY VOTE THAT IS A
PROGRESSIVE VOTE, I WILL

76
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
TAKE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

77
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,780
I WHILE WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT
THAT ARE SOME OF THE 2020

78
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,400
CANDIDATES MAKING SURE THAT THEY
ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,110
THE PROGRESSIVE BASE YEAR?

80
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,990
OF COURSE.

81
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,870
OF COURSE.

82
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,870
AND GOOD, WONDERFUL.

83
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,130
THERE ARE REAL PROGRESSIVES ON
THE LIST, THERE ARE PEOPLE

84
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,860
WHO ARE TRYING TO PLEASE
PROGRESSIVES THAT ARE

85
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,210
LISTED BY THE WAY, IN WASHINGTON
THAT IS FROWNED UPON, THEY

86
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,600
HAD ABOUT THAT WAY.

87
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,820
THERE'S LITERATURE TO THAT THAT
OTHERWISE THEY PROBABLY

88
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,030
WOULDN'T HAVE.

89
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,360
AND IT'S YOU GUYS MAKING THEM
VOTE THAT WAY.

90
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,170
GOOD, PUT ON MORE PRESSURE.

91
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,589
AND THE THIRD PART OF THAT
LIST IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE

92
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,958
PRIMARIES COMING UP.

93
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,780
DIANE FEINSTEIN IS ONE OF THE
MOST CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS

94
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,470
IN THE COUNTRY.

95
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,870
SHE VOTED FOR BUSH'S TAX CUTS
WHEN NOBODY WAS PAYING

96
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,390
ATTENTION, TO REPEAL THE ESTATE
TAX WHEN NO ONE IS PAYING

97
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,120
ATTENTION, THE IRAQ WAR, THE
LIST GOES ON AND ON TO ALL

98
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,840
THIS AND SHE IS IN A PRIMARY IN
CALIFORNIA WHERE THE DREAM

99
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,430
ACT IS PRETTY RELEVANCE AND
HER PRIMARY OPPONENTS ARE

100
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,650
PUTTING HEAT ON HER AND SHE'S
LIKE NO DREAM ACT?

101
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,010
THEN I SAY NO.

102
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,740
GLAD TO SEE YOU WOKE UP BUT THAT
IS PART OF THE MOTIVATION HERE.

103
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,170
ALL GOOD BOTH, I WILL TAKE THEM,
BLESS THEIR HEARTS ARE

104
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,600
A BY THE WAY IT'S ENOUGH TO
MAKE YOU THINK THAT WE

105
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,700
SHOULD HAVE MORE THESE PRIMARIES
A.

106
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,370
MAYBE LONG-TERM IS A GOOD THING
FOR THE PARTY.

107
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,190
GEEZ I WONDER IF THAT'S HOW
POLITICS WORKS?

108
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,470
BEFORE WE GET INTO SOME OF
THE NITTY-GRITTY OF WHAT

109
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,960
CHUCK SCHUMER WAS ABLE TO GET
AND WHAT HE REALLY WAS NOT AND

110
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,560
MAY NOT BE CONCERNED ENOUGH
ABOUT, DONALD TRUMP HAD A

111
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:32,990
STATEMENT SAYING I AM PLEASED,
GET READY FOR 

112
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:39,730
THE SPIN.

113
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,991
IF YOU BELIEVE THE UPCOMING
DEAL, OR MEMBER THIS IS

114
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:46,030
COMING FROM A PRESIDENT WHO IS
SAYING WHATEVER YOU GUYS

115
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,020
GIVE ME APPLE SIGNED UP TO COVER
THAT TWO WEEKS AGO THAT HE

116
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,020
NOW SPENDS AT THE ENTIRE
DISCUSSION IS ABOUT HOW

117
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,990
UNFAIR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS.

118
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,530
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN FOR THE
FUTURE RIGHT THERE AND BY THE

119
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,021
WAY, WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF
SHUTDOWNS LIKE THIS AS IN 2013

120
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:06,770
WHEN THE DEMOCRATS PUT OUT A
SEPARATE BILL BEFORE THE

121
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,460
SHUTDOWN TO MAKE SURE THAT
MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY GOT

122
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,740
PAID DURING THE SHUTDOWN WHICH
DIDN'T NECESSARILY BE THE

123
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,800
WAY THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN.

124
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,710
THEY TRIED TO DO THE SAME THING
HERE BUT THE REPUBLICANS

125
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,800
WOULD ALLOW ANOTHER SPINNING AS
THE DEMOCRATS TRYING TO

126
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,990
STOP MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY
FROM BEING PAID.

127
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,490
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY
IN THIS.

128
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,620
WE HAVE A CONTINUING RESOLUTION
THAT FUNDS THE GOVERNMENT

129
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,260
FOR THREE WEEKS WHICH IS
DEFINITELY HOW THE MOST

130
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,230
POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD SHOULD CONTINUE

131
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,360
TO FUNCTION, BEING FUNDED AND
THREE WE CAN COMMENCE.

132
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,320
IF WE DON'T HAVE A DEAL ON
DOCK AT THE MEANTIME MITCH

133
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,130
MCCONNELL SAYS THAT HE WILL
BRING IT UP FOR A VOTE ON

134
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,740
THE SENATE ALTHOUGH WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT THAT BILL THAT WILL

135
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,160
BE BROUGHT UP WILL BE AND PAUL
RYAN ISN'T BOUND TO DO ANYTHING

136
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,610
IN THE HOUSE AND WE DON'T KNOW
IF TRUMP IS OR IS NOT GOING

137
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,760
TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT DEBATE OR
WHAT HIS POSITION MIGHT BE

138
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,430
THAT I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT
HIS POSITION MIGHT BE.

139
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,620
THE PLUS SIDE I GUESS AT LEAST
IS THAT IN NO PART OF THE DEAL

140
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,900
DID THEY MAKE ANY, DID THEY GIVE
AWAY THE WALL FUNDING OR CHANGES

141
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,120
FOR LEGAL IMMIGRATION OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE PLUS

142
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,570
SIDE, THE ONE GOOD THING IS THAT
THEY DID GET SIX YEARS OF

143
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,790
FUNDING FOR CHIP.

144
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,650
WE'VE BEEN WAITING MONTHS FOR
THIS DIVE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE

145
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,600
THAT THEIR KIDS ARE ON CHIP AND
THEY ARE WORRIED THEY'RE

146
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,290
GOING TO BE TURN OFF THEIR
INSURANCE.

147
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,790
NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO GET A
FUNDED ONE MONTH AT A TIME

148
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,790
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

149
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,240
6 YEARS OF FUNDING WHICH IS
SIGNIFICANT.

150
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
IT IS.

151
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,960
LOOK, I KNOW A LOT OF
PROGRESSIVES ARE UPSET

152
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,550
ABOUT INEZ USUAL, TO NOT INCLUDE
THE DREAM ACT.

153
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,180
I'M GUESS I'M NOT AS UPSET AS
OTHER PEOPLE IS BECAUSE I'M

154
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,169
NOT SURPRISED.

155
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,290
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A LOT MORE
HOPE THAN I DO.

156
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,850
THEY'RE LIKE I REALLY THINK
CHUCK SCHUMER IS GOING TO

157
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,850
DELIVER.

158
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,860
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

159
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,460
BUT TO BE FAIR TO CHUCK SCHUMER
AND THE OTHER NEGOTIATORS HERE,

160
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,520
IT IS ONLY A THREE WEEK
EXTENSION AND AT LEAST CHIP IS

161
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,729
OFF THE TABLE.

162
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:57,840
NOW I AM NOT UNAWARE OF HOW WE
GOT HERE.

163
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,140
BACK IN SEPTEMBER THE
REPUBLICANS TOOK TWO HOSTAGES.

164
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,330
ONE WAS CHIP.

165
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,340
IT WAS BIPARTISAN SINCE ITS
CREATION IN 1997.

166
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,229
IN FACT ONE OF ITS CREATORS IS
ORRIN HATCH OF ALL PEOPLE.

167
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:11,870
TED KENNEDY AND ORRIN HATCH.

168
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,180
AND CHIP HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY
SUCCESSFUL.

169
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,419
NOW CHILDREN ON CHIP HAVE AS
GOOD AS INSURANCE IF NOT

170
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,400
BETTER THAN THE PRIVATE MARKET
AND IT HAS REDUCED SICKNESS

171
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,710
AMONG CHILDREN.

172
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,710
IT IS WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF
GOVERNMENT SUCCESS.

173
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,790
THAT IS WHERE THE REPUBLICANS
TURN AROUND AND GO WE MUST THINK

174
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,769
ABOUT KILLING IT.

175
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:35,339
INCLUDING ORRIN HATCH.

176
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,740
NOW THE TIMES OF GOTTEN MUCH
MORE VICIOUS AND WHETHER THEY

177
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,519
WANTED TO KILL IT OR NOT,
ULTIMATELY, THIS IS THE

178
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:45,350
BEGINNING OF THAT PROCESS, THE
MORE IMPORTANT THING SHORT TERM

179
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,741
WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE SO THAT WHEN
YOU GIVE IT BACK TO THE REPUBLIC

180
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:52,180
THE DEMOCRATS COUPLE MONTHLY TO
GIVE YOU THE WHOLE BUDGET AND

181
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,050
THE OTHER HOSTAS THEY TOOK WITH
DOCTOR SO TRUMP SAID THAT'S IT,

182
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,290
WERE NOT PROTECTING THE DREAMERS
ANYMORE, WE MADE THAT DECISION

183
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,470
UNILATERALLY AND SINCE SEPTEMBER
THOSE TWO THINGS THAT WERE

184
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,990
BIPARTISAN AND WERE APPROVED ALL
ALONG FOR ALL OF THESE YEARS ALL

185
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,470
OF A SUDDEN BECAME PART OF THE
NEGOTIATION SO NOW THE DEMOCRATS

186
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,230
ARE FIGHTING LIKE HELL TO TRY TO
GET BACK TO THE STATUS QUO OF

187
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,730
SEPTEMBER 2017 WHEN TRUMP WAS
ALREADY IN CHARGE.

188
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,360
THIS IS HOW THE REPUBLICANS PLAY
THE GAME.

189
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,060
ONE HOSTAGE AFTER ANOTHER.

190
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,100
CHILDREN MIGHT LOSE THEIR HEALTH
INSURANCE?

191
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,399
THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS
REACTION TO THAT.

192
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,550
WAY, IS A DONOR CHILDREN?

193
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,700
NO?

194
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,480
THEY DON'T CARE.

195
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,779
DREAMERS.

196
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:44,160
YOUNG KIDS WHO ARE DOING WELL
IN AMERICA WHO DO NOT EVEN

197
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,189
KNOW THE COUNTRY THEY CAME FROM.

198
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:48,519
WHAT DO THE REPUBLICANS CARE?

199
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,630
THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THAT AT
ALL.

200
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,370
THAT IS WHY THEY DON'T MEAN
TAKING HOSTAGES WHEREAS A LOT OF

201
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,709
DEMOCRATS DO MINDED THAT'S WHY
THE REPUBLICANS KEEP DOING IT.

202
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,740
THE WAY THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO
WORK AS THE MANY THEY TAKE

203
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,689
THE HOSTAGE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING
TO WORK AT AND GO LOOK AT

204
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:07,779
THESE MONSTERS WHO JUST ENDED
THIS INSURANCE PROGRAM FOR KIDS.

205
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,180
LOOK AT HOW SUCCESSFUL IT WAS
NATION FOR LITTLE KIDS TO

206
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,009
HAVE CHIP THAT ARE NO LONGER
GOING TO GET HEALTH

207
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:14,389
INSURANCE AND THAT MIGHT DIE.

208
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:18,970
INSTEAD, DEMOCRATS DO NOTHING,
PLEASE GIVE IT BACK TO US.

209
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,649
NOW I'M ACTUALLY A LITTLE
EXCITED WE GOT CHIP BACK

210
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:26,420
AND FOR JUST A THREE WEEK
EXTENSION.

211
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,829
WE GOT HALF THE HOSTAGES BACK.

212
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,350
UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS DAY AND
AGE THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS

213
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,509
DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP CAN DO.

214
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:38,790
LOOK OVERALL, AFTER SPENDING
THE DAY GETTING UPDATES ON THIS

215
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,360
AND FINDING OUT, IS ELECTION
GOING TO PASS AS ORIGINALLY THAT

216
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,569
WHITE HOUSE WAS AGAINST IT AND
THEY WERE FOR IT, NOW IT LOOKS

217
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:48,279
LIKE IT PASSED THE HOUSE DUST I
HATE THE HOT TAKES.

218
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,540
HIT THE UNINFORMED KNEE-JERK
HOT TAKES THAT THERE WERE

219
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,980
PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO DECLARE
VICTORY WHEN THEY SOUGHT

220
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,980
REGARDLESS OF THE DETAILS.

221
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,100
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING
TO DAMN IT REGARDLESS OF THE

222
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
DETAILS.

223
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,600
BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DOES
ORBIT, I THINK THESE PLUSES

224
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,319
ARE GOOD, BUT, I THINK THAT THE
DEAL LOOKS BAD AND IS BAD

225
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:07,329
WHICH ARE DIFFERENT THINGS FOR
BOTH OF THEM ARE BAD.

226
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:09,540
I DON'T THINK THEY THAT THEY
SHOULD'VE DONE THIS EVEN THOUGH

227
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,110
THERE ARE SOME GOOD THINGS IN
HERE, I THINK THAT CHUCK SCHUMER

228
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,300
AND SOME OF THE OTHER DEMOCRATS
EITHER HAD SO LITTLE RESPECT FOR

229
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,829
THEIR OWN ABILITY TO FOR
SOMETHING BETTER OR JUST A FEAR

230
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:22,741
THAT AN ONGOING SHUTDOWN WOULD
MAKE THEM LOOK BAD THAT THEY

231
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,189
FELT THE NEED TO BLINK AND I
DON'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO MAKE

232
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:28,459
THEM LOOK BAD, I THINK THEY
COULD'VE HELD OUT FOR LONGER AND

233
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,970
LOOK, BEST CASE SCENARIO, MIXED
IN WITH WORST-CASE SCENARIO SO

234
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,269
REGULAR SCENARIO, AND THREE
WEEKS, WE MIGHT GET DOCK A

235
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:39,680
OR IN LESS THAN THREE WEEKS.

236
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,149
THAT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE REALLY
HAVE TO WAIT AND FIND OUT

237
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,030
THAT ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY KNOW
FOR SURE THE MONTH WHERE WE

238
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,470
ARE GOING TO BE IS LENGTHY
BECAUSE NOBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS.

239
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,970
DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T KNOW, CHUCK
SCHUMER DOESN'T KNOW THAT

240
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,070
WE HAVE TO SEE.

241
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,331
THIS COULD'VE BEEN WORSE BUT IT
COULD'VE BEEN BETTER AND I

242
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:55,649
THINK THAT THIS IS THE SORT OF
THING THAT CHUCK SCHUMER

243
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,880
AND THE OTHER DEMOCRATS IN
LEADERSHIP DO IT, DOES IT

244
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,740
JUST HAD THEM NOW, LINGERING
HURT BECAUSE WHETHER IT IS

245
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,860
IN THREE WEEKS A TRUCK, IT LOOKS
LIKE A BETRAYAL RIGHT NOW.

246
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,440
I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT
THIS.

247
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,910
AS I JUST TOLD YOU, I THINK IT
IS THE BEST THAT DEMOCRATIC

248
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,439
LEADERSHIP CAN DO.

249
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:18,259
IT IS NOT THE BEST WE CAN GET,
NOT EVEN MILES FROM THAT.

250
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:23,040
SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY SHOULD
HAVE DONE, I AGREE WITH JOHN.

251
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,810
DACA PULLS ANYWHERE BETWEEN 70
AND 80% DEPENDING ON THE WHEN

252
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,809
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A 20

253
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,790
POINT GAP ON WHO PEOPLE WOULD
BLAME, THEY WOULD BEEN

254
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,420
BLAMED THERE PUBLICANS AND TRUMP
THAT YOU CAN'T ANSWER BUT A

255
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,110
SITUATION AND THAT POLITICALLY.

256
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:45,110
WHERE THE EXCUSES THE DEMOCRATS
USED WAS THAT WE HAVE A 14 POINT

257
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,179
LEAD GOING INTO THE 2018

258
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:53,970
ELECTIONS ON GENERIC BALLOTSÖ
BUT, THAT'S IN AND.

259
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,360
BECAUSE WHEN THEY ARE DOWN, I'VE
BEEN COVERING IT FOR OVER

260
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,209
20 YEARS, THE DEMOCRATS GO, BUT
WE CAN'T BECAUSE WE'RE DOWN

261
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:00,889
IN THE POLLS AND THIS WILL MAKE
US LOOK BAD.

262
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:04,209
IF YOU ARE DOWN IN THE POLLS YOU
CAN'T FIGHT, IF YOU ARE UP

263
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:06,050
IN THE POLLS YOU CAN'T FIGHT.

264
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,070
WHEN DO YOU FIGHT?

265
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:12,290
AND THE ANSWER WITH DEMOCRATIC
LEADERSHIP IS ALMOST ALWAYS,

266
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,870
NEVER.

267
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,540
RESISTANCE IN THEIR CASE
APPARENTLY IS FUTILE.

268
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,910
IT IS TINY,
MICROSCOPIC RESISTANCE.

269
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,300
THE CORRECT THING TO DO WOULD
BE, I DON'T THEY HEARD US.

270
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,769
TRUMP LIKES TO SHOUT, OKAY, WE
CAN SHOUT BACK, BUT WE

271
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:31,850
DIDN'T STUTTER.

272
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,319
NO DREAM ACT, NO BUDGET.

273
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:34,319
WE'RE DONE.

274
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:37,050
AND SO THAT IS THE CONVERSATION
WE'RE HAVING WE'RE NOT GOING

275
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,490
BACK TO THE TABLE SO YOU CAN GO
SCREAM ALL YOU WANT, YOU CAN

276
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,799
CALL OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER
PEOPLE ANY NAME YOU LIKE BUT WE

277
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,550
ARE NOT, THERE'S NO DEAL BECAUSE
WE ACTUALLY FIGHT FOR VOTERS.

278
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,690
HOW WOULD THAT BE OR WE FIGHT
FOR AMERICANS, WE FIGHT FOR

279
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,100
OUR SIDE.

280
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,199
HOW GREAT WOULD THAT BE.

281
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,929
BUT THE DEMOCRATS NEVER HAVE
THAT COURAGE BECAUSE THEY VIEW

282
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:02,139
THEIR CONSTITUENTS IS NOT THERE
VOTERS BUT THEIR DONORS SO

283
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:04,239
WHY DOES CHUCK SCHUMER ACTUALLY
PANIC?

284
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:08,489
HE IS ON THE PHONE 4 TO 5 HOURS
A DAY RAISING MONEY.

285
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:11,110
ALMOST EVERYONE HE IS ON THE
PHONE WITH IS A MILLIONAIRE.

286
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,199
ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE A LOT OF
MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET.

287
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:18,699
ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE PROBABLY
TELLING HIM, HEY, WRAP THIS UP.

288
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:22,239
IF THIS HURTS THE MARKETS, IT
HURTS ME WHICH HURTS YOU.

289
00:14:22,239 --> 00:00:00,000
WRAP IT UP ALREADY.
