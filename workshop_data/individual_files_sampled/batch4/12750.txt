well as an example of this one of these students gets up and starts hammering Rubio on taking NRA donations and Rubio won't commit to not take me on our intonation because why the hell should he the NRA is a legal body he's taken like nine thousand dollars in the last election cycle I can a relative nothing but they're asking him to disassociate from a fully legal Second Amendment pushing organization of law-abiding Americans six million strong and he refuses to do it but this of course makes him a villain because it's the NRA responsible for the shootings not the sheriff who blew it not the FBI that blew it not the shooter not the school the people responsible for all of this are of course people who have nothing to do with it far away who own guns and have an NRA membership card here's the student hammering Ruby on an array of donations clip 22 senator Rubio can you tell me right now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA so number one the positions I hold on these issues of the Second Amendment I've held since the day I entered office in the City of West Miami is an elected official number two no the answer is the question is that people buy into my agenda and I do support the Second Amendment and I also support the right of you and everyone here to be able to go to school and be safe and I do support any law that would keep guns out of the hands of a deranged killer and that's why I support the things that I have stood for and fought for during my time I there that is the wrong way to look first of all the answer is people buy into my agenda you give second well I saw I influenced about any group with him here all night the influence of these groups comes not from money the influence comes from the millions of people that agree with the agenda so millions of American to support the NRA and we support gun rights center in the name of 17 people you cannot ask the NRA to keep their money out of your campaign I think in the name of 17 people I can pledge to you that I will support any law that will prevent a killer like this no but I'm getting money but ultimately look the first thing I look at this disgusting display okay again this is the the leading questions that is like in tappers just sitting there I like Jake but Jake is just sitting there and he's allowing this kid to browbeat the senator with a bunch of loaded questions that have nothing then he's not even moving to try and quiet the crowds the Rubio can answer the questions if you're gonna let the kid just go off like this which is fine you want to do that that's fine Rubio put himself there at least tell the crowd to shut up okay at presidential debates they tell the crowd to shut up all the time why is this any different hey why is it different I understand there are a lot of people in there who suffered a lot of people who are upset but if you don't want it to turn into devolve into the Orwellian two minutes of hate then this is not the way to do it it's not the way to do it I mean Rubio can't even answer the question because people are too busy yelling at him
