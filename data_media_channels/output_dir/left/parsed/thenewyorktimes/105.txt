Trump’s attorney, former
New York City mayor –
I’ve been sitting here looking
at the federal code trying
to find collusion as a crime.
It’s not. Collusion
is not a crime.
He tape recorded
conversations of his clients.
He was shaking people down for
money. Like George Washington
didn’t know that Benedict
Arnold was a traitor.
Like Iago betrayed Othello. And Brutus put
the last knife into Caesar.
So you say it
cuts off abruptly and
you think that’s
a smoking gun.
We’ve already heard the – 
I don’t know that it’s smoking gun,
I just know that you
don’t do that with a tape,
and expect that it’s going to 
be admitted into evidence.
But that’s not doctored; that’s
a tape recorder turning off.
Hold that thought, Mr. Mayor.
No, no,
I’m going to leave after this.
What, we’ve scared you away?
Oh yeah, you scared me away.
I looked really scared.
No. It’s starting to get useless.
No.
This conversation is getting really, really, 
really petty and silly.
