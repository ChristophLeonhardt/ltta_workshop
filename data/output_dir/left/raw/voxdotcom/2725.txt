1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,360
These are my assistants, Coleman and Phil.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,000
They're both around the same height, weight,
and consequently,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,620
they have the same Body Mass Index — or BMI.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,640
But if you split them open Damien Hirst style
or just compare the results of their body

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,850
scans you can see a slight difference.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,650
Phil has more body fat than Coleman, and Coleman
has more muscle than Phil.

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,510
Although BMI is a popular measure to assess
if a person’s weight might be putting them

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,460
at risk for obesity-related diseases,
its results can be pretty misleading and less

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,420
nuanced than we’d like.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,180
So the BMI is an index that looks at somebody's

11
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:49,370
body weight divided by their height. So the formula is the body weight

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,820
in kilograms divided by the height in square meters.

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:00,850
18.5 and below is underweight, 18.5 to 24.9
is your healthy range, 25 to 29.9 is overweight,

14
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,099
and a BMI over 30 is classified as obese.

15
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,810
With the idea being that the taller somebody is,
the more they should weigh.

16
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,009
Kinda weird how a single decimal point can
separate being overweight from being obese.

17
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,990
The major problem with using BMI as a marker

18
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:25,649
of health when it comes to body weight, because
it penalizes you if you have a lot of muscle

19
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:26,860
and you're healthier.

20
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,969
Let’s use professional athlete Marshawn
Lynch as an example.

21
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:36,260
He’s 5’11, 215 lbs, and his BMI is 30.

22
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,010
He’d be categorized as obese.

23
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,470
That is because BMI doesn't distinguish muscle
from fat.

24
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:47,369
We are really concentrating on how much
muscle does somebody have, because muscle it's

25
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,689
the metabolic engine it's the thing that burns
calories and the more muscle you have the

26
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:59,380
easier it is for you to stay at a lower and
more healthy body fat percentage not necessarily

27
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,380
a BMI.

28
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,560
In this way, BMI’s reliability as an indicator
of health breaks down for athletes like Lynch.

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,030
There are several more variables that can
influence the interpretation of BMI.

30
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,700
Things like age, gender, and ethnicity.

31
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,250
While BMI is a useful health measure for a
large population study, for example, to compare

32
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,540
relative obesity rates from state to state;
it becomes more problematic when you use it

33
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,959
to determine an individual’s health.

34
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,010
The body mass index was introduced in the
early 19th century.

35
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,290
The guy who created the formula — I’m
so sorry, I’m gonna butcher his name,

36
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,270
Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet — wasn’t
even a physician.

37
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,080
Quetelet was a Belgian mathematician.

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,709
And his reason for creating the formula was
to study the “normal man”, not obesity.

39
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:49,440
Its use shifted to study obesity because of
Ancel Keys.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,420
In 1972, Keys used the formula in his "Indices
of Relative Weight and Obesity” study, renamed

41
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,480
the formula to body mass index, and
from there the “new” measure caught on

42
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,810
among researchers.

43
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,720
Over the years, its use in the health professional
field grew and it’s pretty much stuck around

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
since.

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,520
It's easy to use, cheap, fast, and its right about 80% of the time.

46
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,760
So even though BMI has stuck around for more than 200 years,

47
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,870
it's not the be-all and end-all indicator.

48
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,950
There are others ways to assess to body
composition, and overall health.

49
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,560
Hydrostatic weighing, or underwater weighing, is an option.

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,000
Along with MRI scans,

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,400
and waist-to-hip ratio.

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,160
Medical tests like checking blood pressure,

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,080
your glucose levels,

54
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,300
resting metabolic rate,

55
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,680
can further give a picture of overall health.

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,240
I went to George Washington University, and lab director Todd Miller showed me another way,

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,540
using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
or DEXA image.

58
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:53,420
It measures total body composition, including fat mass, lean body mass, and bone density.

59
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,680
So the green is the areas where the
body is very lean.

60
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,290
The yellow areas of moderate fat.

61
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,180
And the red areas of high fat.

62
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,940
So this person was here July 3rd she
had 72 pounds of fat and 109 pounds of muscle.

63
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:16,420
And in December 27th of this year she had
at thirty seven pounds of fat in 115 pounds

64
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,420
of muscle.

65
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:23,730
Using this chart you can see if this person stepped on a scale, they'd only see they lost 29 pounds.

66
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,120
What the scale wouldn't say is that they gained six pounds of muscles,

67
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,380
and BMI wouldn't say that either.

68
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,420
So even if two people have similar BMIs,

69
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,860
that one number will never truly give either of them

70
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,320
the full picture of their overall wellbeing.

71
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,120
BMI is an indirect measurement of one aspect of an individual's health.

72
00:04:43,520 --> 00:00:00,000
So while it can be helpful, it shouldn't be the only way to understand the human body.
