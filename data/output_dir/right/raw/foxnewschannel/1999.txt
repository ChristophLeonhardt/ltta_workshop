1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,697
OTHER NATIONS INCLUDING THE

2
00:00:01,697 --> 00:00:02,131
UNITED STATES.

3
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:04,467
BUT CHUCK SCHUMER VOTED AGAINST

4
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:07,670
IT SO IT DOESN'T JIVE WITH WHERE

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,005
HE WAS THEN WITH WHAT HE SAYING

6
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:12,208
NOW.

7
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,911
BUT LET'S GET A REACTION OUT

8
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,479
FROM THE LOUISIANA SENATOR.

9
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:18,180
>> IN TERMS OF WHAT SCHUMER SAID

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,883
IT, I AGREE WITH YOUR POINT

11
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:21,551
ABOUT HIS INCONSISTENCY.

12
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:23,119
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,121
IS DOING, THE PRESIDENT IS

14
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:26,522
MAKING THE CALCULUS.

15
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:29,525
SINCE THE SANCTIONS ARE RELAXED,

16
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,160
IRAN HAS INCREASED THEIR

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,928
ACTIVITIES TO DESTABILIZE

18
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:33,829
SAUDI ARABIA AND ATTACK ISRAEL.

19
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:35,731
IT APPEARS THAT HE HAS MADE THE

20
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:36,732
CALCULUS THAT IF WE REIMPOSE

21
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:37,533
SANCTIONS THEY ARE LESS LIKELY

22
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:41,137
TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE FOREIGN

23
00:00:41,137 --> 00:00:44,073
ADVENTURES THAT HAVE DESTABILIZE

24
00:00:44,073 --> 00:00:46,275
THE REGION AND IT TAKES THE RISK

25
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:47,176
WITH THEM RESTARTING THEIR

26
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:49,712
NUCLEAR PROGRAM SOONER, NOT

27
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:50,012
LATER.

28
00:00:50,012 --> 00:00:51,180
>> Shepard: DO YOU BY WHAT

29
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,716
SOMEONE SAID, AND I KNOW THIS

30
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:54,717
WASN'T FORMALLY A TREATY BUT IT

31
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:57,153
DOES CALL INTO QUESTION WHETHER

32
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:58,921
YOU

33
00:00:58,921 --> 00:00:59,922
THE UNITED STATES CAN BE TRUSTED

34
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:04,860
ON AGREEMENTS OF ANY SORT IF THE

35
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,628
PRESIDENT COMES IN AND RIPS THEM

36
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:06,862
UP.

37
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:08,798
>> TYPICALLY THE PRESIDENT COMES

38
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:10,099
IN AND MAKES BIG CHANGES.

39
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:13,202
PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE BIG CHANGES

40
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:20,109
ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S POLICIES.

41
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:21,510
HE SHOULDN'T DO WHAT A

42
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,478
PRESIDENT OBAMA DOES AND KIND OF

43
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:24,113
PUSHES IT THROUGH IN A WAY WHICH

44
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:25,381
IS NOT A TREATY, BECAUSE ONCE

45
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,782
YOU GET THE TREAT OF THAT

46
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:28,985
REFLECTS AS THE CONSENSUS OF THE

47
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:29,318
COUNTRY.

48
00:01:29,318 --> 00:01:32,221
IF YOU TRY TO DO IT WITH A PEN

49
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:33,723
AND A PHONE, ITS EFFECTS ARE

50
00:01:33,723 --> 00:01:36,325
LESS LONG-LASTING.

51
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:37,727
>> Shepard: THE SECRETARY OF

52
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:39,528
THE STATE HAS BEEN IN ITALY AND

53
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:44,066
MUCH OF EUROPE THIS WEEK AND

54
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:47,803
TODAY, MANY PEOPLE SAID HE WAS

55
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:48,904
BEHIND THE SCENES WORKING TO GET

56
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:50,306
FOREIGN LEADERS TO SORT OF

57
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:50,673
PUSHBACK.

58
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:54,110
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

59
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,711
>> CARRIE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS.

60
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:57,880
THE FACT IS THAT DOES HAVE

61
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,614
LIMITED INFLUENCE UPON TRUMP,

62
00:01:58,614 --> 00:02:01,584
AND I THINK TRUMP       TRUMP I

63
00:02:01,584 --> 00:02:01,617
AND I THINK TRUMP       TRUMP IA

64
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:01,651
AND I THINK TRUMP       TRUMP II

65
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:01,684
AND I THINK TRUMP       TRUMP IG

66
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:01,717
AND I THINK TRUMP       TRUMP IT

67
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:03,653
AND I THINK TRUMP       TRUMP IE

68
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:06,322
CALCULUS.

69
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:08,124
OBVIOUSLY IN SYRIA, OBVIOUSLY IN

70
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:09,892
YEMEN, STIRRING UP LOTS OF

71
00:02:09,892 --> 00:00:00,000
TROUBLE.
