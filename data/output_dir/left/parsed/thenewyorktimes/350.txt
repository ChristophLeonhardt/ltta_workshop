This was something that was
online for less than 24 hours,
and it has dominated my
life for three months.
“There’s this online
spreadsheet of men in media.”
“What they’re accused of
doing, who they work for.”
“It’s unverified, anonymous …” “It does raise
these questions …” “Smearing someone …”
I actively tried to avoid
this.
I’m a very private person.
“How do they get their reputation back?”
I did not want this kind
of attention to be on me.
I did not want to be a
person who was sitting down
with The New York Times.
“Are you a little nervous right now?”
Yeah! I created a Google
spreadsheet called
“Shitty Media Men” that could be
shared and anonymously edited.
The idea was that
women could use
it to name somebody
who had behaved badly
towards them, whether through
sexual assault, or rape,
or harassment.
I shared it with
some women colleagues
and friends in my industry
whom I knew had stories.
And then from
there, they sent it
to people they knew had
stories, and they sent it
to people they knew had stories.
And by the time I was
forced to take it down,
which is about 12 hours
after I created it,
there were more
than 70 men named,
and 14 had their
names highlighted
in red to denote that there
were more than one woman who
were accusing that
particular person
of violent physical
assault. Some of the incidents
that were described
there gave me nightmares.
Some of them were
really very violent.
When I was watching
the spreadsheet fill up,
it became clear to
me that a problem
I had already understood as
widespread was, in fact, much,
much broader.
I didn’t really know what to do.
I was overwhelmed.
I was terrified.
“What was your biggest fear
about your name becoming known?”
There is a long history
of violence against women,
and it’s particularly acute
for women who speak out
against misogyny and sexism.
There are things like, I used
to, like a lot of New Yorkers,
just walk around with
headphones in all the time.
And I can’t do that
anymore because I
have to be more aware
of my surroundings
and who might see me
or be following me.
If you are accepting this
as just the way things are,
then you’re sort of
accepting that you’re
going to be treated
badly, and your colleagues
are going to be treated badly.
And, you know, women
you’ve never met
are going to be treated badly.
And I didn’t want to
accept that anymore.
So I decided to
make a first attempt
at trying something else.
Listen, I made the decision
to create this spreadsheet,
so its flaws are my fault.
But there was this obstacle
because the conventional
reporting avenues for women
who have experienced sexual
harassment, or assault, or rape
are really not good ones.
The document that I made
was designed to be private,
but it very quickly went viral.
I want to emphasize,
though, that I don’t even
know who saw it, or who
had it, added to it.
Those women are
anonymous to me as well.
But at the same
time, I could see
that what was going on on
this spreadsheet was also
this act of real solidarity
and community among the women
who work in this industry
to attempt to keep one
another safe. So much
of the conversation
after the spreadsheet
was made public
was about the methodology
of the spreadsheet
and sort of the tactics
that anonymous women were
using to try and
keep each other safe.
People were more worried
about a hypothetical man
whose reputation might be
damaged than real women who
were really raped.
“It’s not a
hypothetical man, right?
There were men who were
named on this who had
to suffer repercussions
in their real life.”
Some companies decided to
conduct investigations.
Not all, but some
of them did result
in men leaving
their jobs or being
fired because they were found
to have committed wrongdoing.
I think it’s their
responsibility
that they acted that way.
Harassment, assault, rape.
These things don’t
happen like the weather.
You know, they don’t
happen by accident.
They happen because people
make a choice to do that
to someone else.
There are a lot of conversations
to be had about sex.
We’re not done
talking about sex.
“Hey hey, ho ho,
sexual violence has got to go.”
There’s #MeToo in
2017, 2018.
In 2014, there was
#YesAllWomen.
And in 1991, there
was “I believe Anita.”
“I thought he respected
my work and that he
trusted my judgment.”
So it can feel like
we’ve been defeated,
right? Because if anybody
had listened to us
the first time we wouldn’t
have to say it again.
But I think that every
time we get a little louder,
and we get a little closer
to making the changes that
actually need to be made.
What I think is next is a
lot of hard work for us all.
