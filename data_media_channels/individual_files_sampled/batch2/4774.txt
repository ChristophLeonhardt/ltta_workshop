leading off our discussion now John Holliman national affairs analyst for NBC News and MSNBC Jennifer Rubin conservative opinion writer at The Washington Post in an MSNBC contributor and Jed Sugarman professor of law at Fordham University and professor Sherman I want to start with you on this simple matter that the National Enquirer found its way finally and very very late in the game to doing the only thing that made sense for today which is dropped this case in the civil case involving Karen McDougal that doesn't do anything to slow down the federal criminal investigation which has already been provoked by all of this but at least they got out of the way of this civil case that could put them into revealing things publicly in the civil case that they're gonna have to reveal in the criminal case Donald Trump Michael Cohen continued to make this same mistake on their side of it they haven't dropped their civil case against stormy Daniels which they should have done a long time ago right and I think the big thing that I think is happening is you have a series of federal and state crimes happening in parallel so Michael Cohen is facing what I list as ten different areas of state crimes and state crimes are unaffected by federal presidential pardons and President Trump cannot fire state prosecutors so right now Cohen is fate when I when I hear the story about the Trump lawyer Goldberg I think it's it's it's obvious any lawyer would tell Michael Cohen there is no pardon no firing that can save you because whether it's the stormy Daniels that raises the bank fraud or false statements or whether it's New York election law or New York obstruction of justice law there's a top-10 list that a New York prosecutor can start with and Michael Cohen is facing many years in state prison not just federal President gentleman the White House confirms that the president well basically probably while the Kimble would presided over hearing was going on on Friday picks up the phone called his most trusted lawyer of his life Jay Goldberg and Jay Goldberg tells us that he told the president Michael Cohen will not stand up for you I don't care what Michael says yeah look Lawrence I think the one heartening thing about this is that Jay Goldberg represents the notion that at some point in his life Donald Trump hired actual lawyers who had actual brains in their heads and could make basic legal and strategic assumptions before the period when he switched to hiring clowns like Michael Cohen who don't really qualify as lawyers in any meaningful way Jay Goldberg is making the most obvious observation in the world it is the as you pointed out it's the same observation that Michael happen at E who-who I've been spending a lot of time with this week as we get ready to our second episode of the circus on Showtime I've been spendin like that bit with him for the last three days and he's he's convinced as Goldberg is that Michael Cohen who Donald Trump did not take with him to Washington DC what Michael Kohn wanted to go that that that Michael Cohen who's who's gonna be looking at significant jail time in a vanadis view and apparently in Goldberg's view that this man is going to stare down jail time and and not and stand up for Donald Trump and say I'm gonna go to prison rather than a roll over on Donald Trump who has not treated me particularly well has not stood up for me in this case has done a series of things that screwed me over in this case and didn't even want to take me with him to Washington DC left me behind the notion that Cohen is gonna is gonna be a tough guy here and take the prison time is ludicrous and Goldberg is making that point it's a point that Donald Trump obviously should take seriously when you have your former lawyer as Donald Trump and your most fierce opponent agreeing on a matter it's probably true Jennifer Rubin president Trump is surrounded by lawyers all day he's got Ty Cobb he's got the lawyers who have already been engaged to handle the special prosecutors investigation what's left of them anyway he even has his White House Counsel but he picks up the phone on Friday when there is this extraordinary evidentiary hearing in federal court in New York City provoked by Michael Cohen in the raid on Michael Cohen and he wants to talk to Jay Goldberg and Jay Goldberg tells him michael cohen not only will not stand up for you michael cohen might wear a wire to entrap you so j goldberg who knows these players is saying something in stronger terms then michael avenatti has ever used I think Michael a Vinod he's watching Michael Kohn from a similar distance of the rest of us and doesn't know him the way Jay Goldberg knows this situation Donald Trump made that call because he values that advice and now Donald Trump has to consider that advice as he goes forward I think you should pick up the phone and call somebody else Jade Goldberg should not have been blabbing to the Wall Street Journal about the advice he gave his client that actually is attorney-client privilege so Goldberg in my book is not behaving like a sane and sensible lawyer secondly he need Trump the world's worst advice suggesting that he could choose not to sit down with special prosecutor Robert Mullen that is false it's not a choice you can decide he doesn't want to cooperate but eventually he'll get a subpoena and eventually he'll have to go talk to him so I'm not sure what mr. Goldberg's game is other than getting his name in the Wall Street Journal but Donald Trump should go out and get a real real lawyer now it's good now as far as the advice for mr. Cohen I think it is inconceivable that Cohen doesn't know things that are going to help both the New York prosecutor and the special counsel remember Michael Cohen is the one who with filk Seder was pursuing the Trump Tower in Moscow Jill Phillips Seder is the one who lived in the building and who helped fund at Donald Trump's projects Michael Cohen is the one who has the connection both to Russia and to the women he's the one nexus for both of these parallel scandals that are going on and I totally agree with John on this point there is no way in heck that Michael Cohen is going to jail for anybody so to the extent that he knows both things that are going to be of interest to the special prosecutor as well as things that may be of use to the New York prosecutors he is a fairly important character Donald Trump you forgot to mention of course who spoke to Michael Cohen on Friday another dumb move because what is he doing talking to a key witness is really according to White House sources everything we know has got Donald Trump absolutely panicked judge triggermen what we do know that the president did take Jay Goldberg's advice about getting solid New York lawyers to handle this he has and the president now has Joanna Hendon handling the case very very capable former federal prosecutor herself but to Michael Abba noddies point which is now echoed by Jay Goldberg that Michael Cohen will probably face charges in this is that an assessment that you can almost bet on because of just how high the bar is in getting search warrants to go after a lawyer it's really remarkable that the search warrant that they had to be able to go through attorney-client privilege and get what they had but I would also say given the news reports just about the campaign finance I mean it was so clear that he Michael that Michael Cohen was left under the bus was thrown under the bus for a campaign finance violation but we know that this investigation was going on before that admission and also there's a lot of reporting about Michael Cohen's background over a decade and all of the work he was doing behind the scenes it wouldn't be surprising that it was much more than campaign finance violations that prosecutors had solid probable cause for John Heilemann go ahead well yeah I mean I think that's exactly right I mean Jennifer just alluded to the reality here in the period of time that Michael Cohen has worked for Donald Trump and the Trump Organization it's the period of time where the Trump Organization was on it's a global expansion spree and they were trying to slap the Trump name on two buildings around the world we've read a lot about the fact that that that that Michael Cohen had was the one who engineered the letter of intent to put up a Trump Tower in Moscow as late as October of 2015 when Donald Trump was an active presidential candidate but that is just the tip of the iceberg Donald Trump's tentacles were trying to be spread all over the world in a lot of shady countries doing business a lot of shady people some of them connected to organized crime some of them connected to money laundering some of them connected to Oleg arcs of various stripes and of various nationalities this is the stuff that Michael Cohen was doing he was a biz dev lawyer for Donald Trump in some of the worst parts of the world so is it likely in the period that period of time that Michael Kahn was engaged in activity that is maybe criminal or edges up to the line of criminality that that is it's certainly worthy of Investigation and of serious criminal probing that's undoubtedly true and so the campaign finance violations of has been the camels nose under the tent it opened the door here related to the stormy Daniels case but now we're in a whole different world and the problems that the president's facing is because of those issues that are now being raised as as prosecutors go through on whatever basis the the privilege issues are resolved they are going to see a lot of stuff related to a lot of really really really nefarious again I can't judge criminal because I don't see the I don't have the evidence in front of me but a lot of very shady activity hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
