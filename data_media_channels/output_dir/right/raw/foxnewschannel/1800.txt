JERUSALEM.

9
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:16,018
THE MOVE COMES AMID HIGH

10
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:16,986
TENSIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND

00:00:16,986 --> 00:00:17,286
IRAN.

12
00:00:17,286 --> 00:00:19,822
MORE ON THE IRANIAN SIDE IN A

13
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:20,156
MINUTE.

14
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:21,123
THIS OF COURSE MARKS COMPLETION

15
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:23,092
OF A MAJOR CAMPAIGN PROMISE FOR

16
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:25,027
THE PRESIDENT AND CLEARLY A SHOW

17
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:27,963
OF SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL BY THE

18
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:28,431
ADMINISTRATION.

19
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:30,166
WITH THAT, DAVID KING, SPOKESMAN

20
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:34,303
FOR PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN

21
00:00:34,303 --> 00:00:34,970
NETANYAHU.

22
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:35,738
24 HOURS IN THE BIG CELEBRATION.

23
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:38,507
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

24
00:00:38,507 --> 00:00:39,809
LET'S LOOK BEYOND TOMORROW.

25
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:40,943
BIG CELEBRATION PLANNED BY THE

26
00:00:40,943 --> 00:00:43,579
PRIME MINISTER AND THE ISRAELIS

27
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:44,246
OR PALESTINIANS AREN'T HAPPY

28
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:45,681
ABOUT IT.

29
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:48,918
THEY PLAN MAJOR PROTESTS.

30
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:51,020
LET'S LOOK TOWARDS TUESDAY AT

31
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,353
FORWARD.

32
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:55,658
HOW DOES THIS CHANGE THINGS?

33
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:57,626
>> WELL, CHANGES THINGS IN TWO

34
00:00:57,626 --> 00:00:58,894
FUNDAMENTAL WAYS.

35
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:00,930
IT RESTORES THE BALANCE OF TRUTH

36
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,465
TO THE REGION AND RECOGNIZES ONE

37
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:03,199
OF THE MOST ANCIENT AND OBVIOUS

38
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,167
TRUTHS THERE EVER WAS IN

39
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:07,837
JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF

40
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:09,071
ISRAEL V. JEWISH PEOPLE FOR 3000

41
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:12,374
YEARS AND CAPITAL OF THE STATE

42
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:13,142
FOR 70 YEARS AND IT'S HIGH TIME

43
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:13,876
THE REST OF THE WORLD RECOGNIZE

44
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:14,443
IT AS WELL.

45
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:18,114
IT ALSO ADVANCES PEACE IN A VERY

46
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:19,515
MAJOR WAY BECAUSE PEACE CANNOT

47
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:21,584
BE BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF

48
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:21,884
LIES.

49
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:22,518
HE'S HAS TO BE BUILT ON A

50
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:24,420
FOUNDATION OF TRUTH AND THIS IS

51
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,122
THE FIRST TIME IN A VERY LONG

52
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:29,258
TIME WHERE WE ARE STUDYING WHAT

53
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:31,293
THE TRUTH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT

54
00:01:31,293 --> 00:01:32,695
JERUSALEM, ISRAEL, THIS REGION

55
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:35,097
AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHY IT IS A

56
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:39,301
WONDERFUL STEP.

57
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,069
LELAND: THAT IS AN ANALYSIS THAT

58
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:41,337
I HAVE NOT QUITE HEARD FROM

59
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:44,073
SHALL WE SAY THE PALESTINIAN

60
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:44,473
SIDE.

61
00:01:44,473 --> 00:01:45,441
THEY ARE GOING TO WALK AWAY

62
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:48,777
ESSENTIALLY FROM THE NEGOTIATING

63
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,246
TABLE AND RETURN, SOME WOULD

64
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:50,746
CALL OF VIOLENCE.

65
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:53,349
OTHERS WOULD CALL A PROTEST,

66
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:54,016
WHETHER IT BE IN GAZA OR THE

67
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:55,518
WEST BANK.

68
00:01:55,518 --> 00:01:57,086
THE IDF IS READY FOR WHATEVER

69
00:01:57,086 --> 00:02:01,190
COMES THIS WEEK THEY SAY.

70
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,957
DOES THEM WALK GOING AWAY REALLY

71
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:06,061
MATTER TO YOUR GOVERNMENT?

72
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:06,595
>> SURE IT MATTERS.

73
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:08,030
IT MAKES IT A LOT HARDER TO

74
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,364
OBTAIN.

75
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:10,598
PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP HAS

76
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,034
WALKED AWAY A LONG TIME AGO.

77
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:13,669
THEY SAID NO TO EVERY SINGLE ONE

78
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:16,238
OF OUR OVERTURES FOR

79
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:16,672
NEGOTIATIONS.

80
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:17,907
INSTEAD THEY PAY HUNDREDS OF

81
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:19,508
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO

82
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:20,176
TERRORISTS AND MURDERERS AND

83
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:22,978
FAMILIES OF TERRORIST.

84
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:25,748
ONE EXAMPLE, WHO MURDERED ALMOST

85
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:26,982
AN ENTIRE FAMILY IS BEING PAID

86
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:27,683
$2 MILLION OVER THE COURSE OF

87
00:02:27,683 --> 00:02:30,186
HIS LIFETIME.

88
00:02:30,186 --> 00:02:32,087
IMAGINE A $2 MILLION TO DO IF IT

89
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:32,988
WENT TO PEACE INSTEAD OF

90
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:33,389
TERRORISTS.

91
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:35,491
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THE

92
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:36,358
PALACE AND INTERCEDE NO.

93
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,460
WE HOPE THEY SAY YES BECAUSE THE

94
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,095
DIALOGUE AND DISCUSSION AND

95
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:44,800
COMPROMISE.

96
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,568
>> BUT DAVID, IF THERE ARE

97
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:46,302
EVENTS THAT HAPPENED THAT YOUR

98
00:02:46,302 --> 00:02:49,071
GOVERNMENT PUSHED FOR, WHICH WAS

99
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:50,906
DISMISSED FROM TEL AVIV TO

100
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:54,243
JERUSALEM AND NOW YOU SAY

101
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:55,411
BECAUSE OF THIS MOVE THE

102
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:56,145
PALESTINIANS HAVE DONE SOMETHING

103
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:58,247
THAT MAKES PEACE HARDER TO COME

104
00:02:58,247 --> 00:02:58,514
BY.

105
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:00,449
HOW CAN YOU HAVE IT BOTH WAYS?

106
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,117
>> IT'S NOT BOTH WAYS.

107
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:03,819
THEY SAID NO LONG BEFORE IT WAS

108
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,590
MOVED TO JERUSALEM.

109
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,526
LELAND: HOW DO YOU MAKE THINGS

110
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:10,926
EASIER?

111
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:11,627
>> IT MAKES IT EASIER BECAUSE

112
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:12,394
THE REST OF THE WORLD CAN SAY TO

113
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:14,897
THE PALESTINIANS AT TIME TO GET

114
00:03:14,897 --> 00:03:15,664
REAL.

115
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:17,166
THIS IS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL

116
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:17,900
AND ITS NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

117
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,635
IT WILL BE THE CAPITAL OF

118
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:19,969
ISRAEL.

119
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:22,037
SO ONE OF THE WORLD IN THE

120
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:24,006
PALACE INDIANS ENTERTAIN

121
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:25,774
FANTASIES, MAYBE IT'S NOT IN

122
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:26,141
JERUSALEM.

123
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:29,345
RIGHT BEHIND ME IS THE KNESSET,

124
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:30,346

FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN A

129
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:38,420
LONG TIME, IT TELLS THE REST OF

130
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,722
THE WORLD THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE

131
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:40,189
THE CAPITAL IS.

132
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,125
IT'S TIME TO GET REAL.

133
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,527
>> I STOOD WHERE YOU ARE MANY

134
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:46,262
TIMES ANY APPRECIATE YOU STAYING

135
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:48,364
FOCUSED WITH THE SOUNDS OF WHAT

136
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:49,031
A SUNDAY NIGHT IN JERUSALEM

137
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:51,600
BEHIND YOU.

138
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,836
BY WAY OF EXPLANATION, DO OUR

139
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:55,971
VIEWERS KNOW BY NOW TO THE ISSUE

140
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:56,405
OF IRAN?

141
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:58,707
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT PEACE

142
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:00,209
WITH ANYBODY BE AT THE ATTACK ON

143
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,812
ISRAEL FROM SYRIA A COUPLE DAYS

144
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:04,113
AGO.

145
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:05,281
OR CHANTING DEATH TO AMERICA IN

146
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:07,583
THE STREETS ON FRIDAY.

147
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,751
LISTEN TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE

148
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:11,954
ON "FOX NEWS SUNDAY" TO GET YOUR

149
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:12,388
REACTION.

150
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:15,858
>> I THINK HASSAN ROUHANI NEEDS

151
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:18,127
TO EXPLAIN WHY IS THE CASE THAT

152
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:18,894
WHILE THE AGREEMENT WAS IN PLACE

153
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:19,795
IRAN CONTINUED ACROSS THE MIDDLE

154
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:20,095
EAST.

155
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,434
LELAND: HOW CONCERNED IS YOUR

156
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:30,139
COUNTRY WOULD YOU PLAN TO DO

157
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,040
ABOUT IT?

158
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,740
>> ARRANGE A SHOT 20 MISSILES

159
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,742
INTO ISRAEL.

160
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:35,077
IRAN HAS MOVED ITS ARMY A

161
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:35,611
THOUSAND MILES WEST.

162
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:37,846
WHAT ON EARTH IS HE DOING AT

163
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:39,982
ISRAEL'S BORDER?

164
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:41,817
TO GET THE ANSWER TO THAT

165
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:42,584
QUESTION COME YOU HAVE TO LISTEN

166
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:45,020
TO WHAT THE LEADERSHIP SAYS.

167
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,722
THEY ARE NOT JUST SHOUTING DEATH

168
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:47,289
TO ISRAEL.

169
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:48,257
THEY ARE SHOUTING DEATH TO

170
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:50,225
AMERICA AND THEY SAID OVER AND

171
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:52,361
OVER AGAIN WE WILL ANNIHILATE

172
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:52,928
THE STATE OF ISRAEL.

173
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:54,997
A FEW DAYS AGO THE PRIME

174
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:56,999
MINISTER EXPOSED OVER 100,000

175
00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:00,736
SECRET DOCUMENTS FROM IRAN,

176
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:01,770
SECRET NUCLEAR ARCHIVE WHICH

177
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,838
PROVES BEYOND A SHADOW OF A

178
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:04,807
DOUBT THAT IRAN HAD A

179
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:06,575
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO BUILD A

180
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:07,309
NUCLEAR WEAPON IN THE IRANIAN

181
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:08,777
LEADERSHIP WAS LYING THROUGH ITS

182
00:05:08,777 --> 00:05:11,780
TEETH ARE JUST A FEW DAYS AGO

183
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,481
THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID WE

184
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:15,250
NEVER WANTED TO BUILD A BOMB

185
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:15,951
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THEY

186
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:19,054
HAD AN ENTIRE METHODICALLY

187
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:24,727
CATALOGED ARSENAL -- ARCHIVE.

188
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:26,595
LELAND: DAVID, THIS BRINGS UP AN

189
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:27,663
IMPORTANT POINT AND THAT IS

190
00:05:27,663 --> 00:05:28,364
REASONABLE PEOPLE COULD AGREE

191
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:31,467
THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF LOVE LOST

192
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:35,804
BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND YOUR

193
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:36,472
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU AND

194
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:37,373
SOME FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENTS

195
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:40,142
ABOUT IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

196
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:41,377
WHAT IS IT LIKE NOW TO HAVE AN

197
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:43,011
ADMINISTRATION THAT IS SO

198
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:45,514
SUPPORTIVE OF ISRAEL, SO

199
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:48,083
SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR ACTIONS

200
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:53,622
AGAINST IRAN AND IN LOCKSTEP?

201
00:05:53,622 --> 00:05:54,790
>> WELL, LET ME SAY THE

202
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,524
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED

203
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:57,960
STATES OF AMERICA AND ISRAEL HAS

204
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,363
NEVER BEEN STRONGER THAN IT IS

205
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:01,663
TODAY.

206
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:02,498
THIS IS A PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT

207
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:02,798
WEEK.

208
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:06,201
THE RECOGNITION OF JERUSALEM,

209
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,736
THE MOVING OF THE EMBASSY AND

210
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:08,470
THE ENDING OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR

211
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,539
DEAL, WHICH PUT IRAN ON THE PATH

212
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,776
TOWARDS AN ARSENAL OF NUCLEAR

213
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:15,177
WEAPONS AND HAD IDEAL BEEN

214
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:15,811
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE, IRAN

215
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:17,679
WOULD'VE BEEN WELL PLACED TO

216
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:19,681
HAVE A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF

217
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:22,885
ENRICHED URANIUM FOR ONE

218
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:23,385
SINGULAR PURPOSE.

219
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:24,386
THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL.

220
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:26,288
I KNOW THAT AMERICA IS SUCH A

221
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:27,890
STRONG ALLY AND THEY COULDN'T

222
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,160
STAND BY AND LET THAT HAPPEN.

223
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,095
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS

224
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:33,862
CONVERGENCE NOT JUST OF INTEREST

225
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:35,464
AND OF VALUES, BUT A WAY OF

226
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:37,633
SEEING THE MIDDLE EAST TODAY AND

227
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:38,367
IT'S NO DOUBT THAT IRAN REMAINS

228
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:41,770
THE BIGGEST THREAT IN THE ENTIRE

229
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,838
MIDDLE EAST AND IT'S IMPORTANT

230
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:46,675
ENTIRE WORLD AND EVERYBODY WAS

00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:47,342
PEACE AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND

232
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:49,878
JUSTICE WORK TO CHANGE THE

233
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:50,546
POLICIES OF THIS DANGEROUS

234
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:54,616
REGIME IN TEHRAN.

235
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:55,584
>> NOTEWORTHY NOW, THERE ARE SO

236
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:56,385
MANY ARAB COUNTRIES THAT AGREE

237
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:59,188
WITH THE SENTIMENT THAT IRAN NOW

238
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,956
IS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO PEACE,

239
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:01,757
WHETHER IT BE THE SAUDI'S ARE

240
00:07:01,757 --> 00:00:00,000
SOME OF THE GULF STATES AS WELL.
