1
00:00:00,347 --> 00:00:01,482
>> Shannon: HE ACTUALLY FLEW

2
00:00:01,482 --> 00:00:02,182
INSTEAD OF TAKING A SPECIAL

3
00:00:02,182 --> 00:00:04,585
TRAIN THIS TIME.

4
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:05,152
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

5
00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:07,554
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

6
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:08,255
FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA

7
00:00:08,255 --> 00:00:10,691
HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT

8
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:11,492
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECISION TO

9
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:12,693
PULL THE U.S. OUT OF THE IRAN

10
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:14,895
DEAL.

11
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:16,697
"LEAVING THE AGREEMENT COULD

12
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:18,532
EMBOLDEN AN ALREADY DANGEROUS

13
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:19,199
REGIME, THREATEN OUR FRIENDS

14
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,235
WITH DESTRUCTION, POSE

15
00:00:21,235 --> 00:00:23,070
UNACCEPTABLE DANGEROUS TO

16
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,072
AMERICA'S SECURITY AND TRIGGER

17
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:27,307
AN ARMS RACE IN THE WORLD'S MOST

18
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:28,308
DANGEROUS REGION."

19
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:29,576
LET'S GET REACTION FROM

20
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:30,210
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN AND

21
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,213
VETERAN FROM FLORIDA BRIAN MATZ,

22
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:33,914
ON A HOUSE FOREIGN RELATIONS

23
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,616
COMMITTEE AMONG OTHER THINGS.

24
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:39,853
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WANT.

25
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:40,621
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT WHAT

26
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:42,322
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID?

27
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:43,323
>> I THINK THEY WERE JUST

28
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:44,024
FLAT-OUT WRONG.

29
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:45,492
YOU LOOK AT THE LAST EIGHT

30
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:45,793
YEARS.

31
00:00:45,793 --> 00:00:46,760
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION,

32
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,562
IT'S LIKE THEY SUFFERED FROM

33
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:50,564
SOME CHAMBERLAIN SYNDROME WHERE

34
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:52,332
IF THEY COULD IGNORE OR A P.R.

35
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:55,135
ENEMIES ENOUGH THAT SOMEHOW OUR

36
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:56,270
ENEMIES WOULD DISAPPEAR OR GO

37
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,671
AWAY AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

38
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:59,273
AFTER THAT THEY WERE EMBOLDENED.

39
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:01,441
YOU SAW THE IRANIAN

40
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:02,209
REVOLUTIONARY GUARD ON THE BANKS

41
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:03,377
OF ISRAEL.

42
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:05,712
YOU SEE WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN

43
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:07,080
YEMEN ATTACKING OUR NAVY

44
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,415
VESSELS, TAKING OUR SAILORS

45
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:08,749
HOSTAGE.

46
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:09,516
YOU'VE SEEN THE THINGS THAT HAVE

47
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:11,218
GONE ON SINCE THEN, THEY'VE

48
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:12,085
BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN.

49
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:12,820
>> Shannon: WHAT YOU MAKE OF

50
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,120
THIS?

51
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,721
I KNOW THAT YOU AND YOUR TIME IN

52
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:16,223
THE ARMY AMONG OTHER THINGS YOU

53
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:17,658
WERE A BOMB ATTACK BUT YOU ALSO

54
00:01:17,658 --> 00:01:18,525
WERE TRAINED WITH REGARD TO

55
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:21,862
NUCLEAR WEAPONRY.

56
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:22,362
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

57
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:23,096
>> Shannon: WHAT DO YOU MAKE

58
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:24,765
ABOUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

59
00:01:24,765 --> 00:01:25,499
SAYS AND WHAT FORMER SECRETARY

60
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:26,466
OF STATE JOHN KERRY HAS BEEN NOT

61
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:28,168
SAYING THIS GUARD RAILS ON THEM

62
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:29,903
TO STOP THEM FROM MOVING FORWARD

63
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:31,471
AND TAKING AWAY THE DEAL TAKES

64
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:32,339
AWAY THOSE PROTECTIONS?

65
00:01:32,339 --> 00:01:34,374
>> THAT'S NOT THE REALITY OF THE

66
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:35,075
SITUATION.

67
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:36,476
THEY NEEDED THREE THINGS TO

68
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:37,311
DEVELOP A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

69
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:39,780
THE MATERIAL TO DO IT, A

70
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,915
DELIVERY SYSTEM, AN ICBM OR

71
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:42,816
WHATEVER DELIVERY SYSTEM TO

72
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:43,917
DELIVER WHEREVER THEY WANT AND

73
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:46,053
THEY NEEDED THE MONEY TO DO IT.

74
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:46,954
PEOPLE SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES WHY

75
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:49,857
IS IT THAT THIS IS TECHNOLOGY

76
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:50,490
THAT THE UNITED STATES OF

77
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,459
AMERICA WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP IN

78
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,328
THE 1940s, THE DELIVERY

79
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:55,896
SYSTEMS BY THE '50s AND 60s

80
00:01:55,896 --> 00:01:56,897
AND IRAN STILL HASN'T DEVELOPED

81
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:57,698
IT TO THIS DAY?

82
00:01:57,698 --> 00:01:59,533
THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE MATERIALS

83
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:00,033
THAT THEY NEEDED.

84
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:01,902
THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE TECHNOLOGY,

85
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:02,636
THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE MONEY THAT

86
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:04,705
THEY NEEDED TO GO OUT THERE AND

87
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:05,906
DEVELOP THESE SYSTEMS.

88
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:07,341
WE LOOSEN THE RESTRICTIONS ON

89
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:09,576
THEM TO DEVELOP THOSE DELIVERY

90
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:11,278
SYSTEMS, THOSE BALLISTIC MISSILE

91
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:11,612
SYSTEMS.

92
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:13,180
WE ALLOW THEM ACCESS TO THE

93
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,481
WORLD STAGE IN TERMS OF BEING

94
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:15,682
OUT THERE TO GO AND SELL THEIR

95
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:17,084
OIL IN THE WORLD STAGE.

96
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:18,919
WE ALLOW THEM TO COLONIZE THE

97
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,686
MIDDLE EAST AND EXPLOIT THE

98
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:20,621
RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE REGION.

99
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:21,555
WE ARE GIVING THEM ALL THE TOOLS

100
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:23,757
THAT THEY NEED AND NOW THE LAST

101
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:24,925
PIECE THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO THEM

102
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:26,426
WAS ALL I HAVE TO DO IS WAIT OUT

103
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:28,795
ENOUGH TIME AND THEY WILL HAVE

104
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:29,997
ALL THE MATERIAL THEY NEED TO GO

105
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:31,398
OUT THERE AND PUT IT ON THE END

106
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:31,865
OF THE WARHEAD.

107
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:33,300
>> Shannon: TODAY REACTION

108
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,303
FROM IRANIAN PRESIDENT SAINT --

109
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:38,305
QUOTED AS SAYING THIS ON STATE

110
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,307
TELEVISION THERE SAYING HE HAD

111
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:42,075
ORDERED IRAN'S ATOMIC ENERGY

112
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:43,277
ORGANIZATION TO PREPARE FOR

113
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:44,311
UNLIMITED URANIUM ENRICHMENT IN

114
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:45,412
THE EVENT THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES

115
00:02:45,412 --> 00:02:47,080
TO WITHDRAW FROM THE PACK.

116
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,582
THEY SAY THE EUROPEANS ARE STILL

117
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:49,917
PART OF THIS, WE ARE NOT LEAVING

118
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:51,318
THE PACT, BUT IF WE DECIDE TO WE

119
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:52,686
ARE READY TO FIRE THE STUFF

120
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:53,287
RIGHT BACK UP.

121
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:54,221
>> THAT'S WHAT WE'VE KNOWN FROM

122
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:56,723
THE VERY BEGINNING.

123
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:57,925
ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THE

124
00:02:57,925 --> 00:02:59,126
PRIME MINISTER PUT OUT THERE,

125
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:00,494
THAT THE IRANIANS WERE CHEATING

126
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:01,695
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

127
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:02,829
THEY WEREN'T AN HONEST BROKER

128
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:03,563
WHEN THEY WERE NEGOTIATING THIS

129
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:05,899
WITH CARRIE, THEY WEREN'T

130
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:07,167
UPFRONT ABOUT WHAT THEIR TRUE

131
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:08,669
INTENTIONS WERE WITHIN NUCLEAR

132
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:10,537
PROGRAM.

133
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:12,272
OUT THERE AND THAT INFORMATION

134
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:12,873
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS

135
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:13,840
REFERENCING, SO WE KNOW THEY ARE

136
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,509
READY TO FIRE THIS PROGRAM UP

137
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:16,910
AND THEY WERE READY TO CHEAT ON

138
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,680
THE PROGRAM WHILE THEY WEREN'T

139
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,849
LETTING INSPECTORS INTO THEIR

140
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:25,619
FACILITIES WHERE WE KNEW THEY

141
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:27,087
WOULD PROBABLY BE DEVELOPING THE

142
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:27,421
SYSTEMS.

143
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:28,555
>> Shannon: MANY OF OUR

144
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:29,556
EUROPEAN ALLIES HAVE URGED THE

145
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:31,491
PRESIDENT TO STAY, TRY TO BETTER

146
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:33,527
IT FROM BEING STILL ENGAGED WITH

147
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:33,894
IT.

148
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:35,095
EMMANUEL MACRON'S TWEET TODAY

149
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:37,531
SAYS FRANCE, GERMANY AND THE

150
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:40,100
U.K. REGRET THE U.S. DECISION TO

151
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,501
LEAVE THE AGREEMENT.

152
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:42,636
THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION

153
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:44,104
REGIME IS AT STAKE.

154
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:44,838
WHAT DOES THIS DO FOR OUR

155
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:46,873
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ALLIES NOW

156
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:47,274
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ALLIES NO

157
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:47,541
NOW?

158
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,508
>> IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE

159
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:49,109
TENUOUS.

160
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:50,677
I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD DENY

161
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:52,379
THAT, BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

162
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,180
COME TO A REALIZATION THAT YOU

163
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,349
DON'T MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR

164
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:55,682
ENEMIES.

165
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,484
YOU NEGOTIATE PEACE WITH FORMER

166
00:03:57,484 --> 00:03:58,986
ENEMIES AND IRAN IS NOT ANY KIND

167
00:03:58,986 --> 00:03:59,586
OF FORMER ENEMY.

168
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,788
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN MAKING

169
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:03,090
THAT KIND OF NEGOTIATION WITH A

170
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,157
NATION THAT'S WILLING TO GO OUT

171
00:04:04,157 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE AND ATTACK OUR SERVICE
