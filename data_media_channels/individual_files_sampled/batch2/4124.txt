according to the individuals familiar with his thinking so far at least five names all of them federal appeals court judges have emerged from the president's shortlist for more I'm joined by Robert Costa national political reporter for The Washington Post Zerlina Maxwell director of progressive programming for Sirius XM and Susan Dell / Co a Republican strategist oil or MSNBC political analyst Robert Kosta let me start with you we got the reporting the president once Harvard or Yale perhaps on this but there's a number of names that are out there what is your sense of this is this a pic work the White House kind of knows where it wants to go how much of this is a potential for a surprise here there's still potential for to surprise the process is fluid talking to White House officials and senior Republicans all day it's evident that at this point at end of day Monday that Judge Cavanaugh and Judge Coney Barrett are widely seen in the president's circle is probably the top two candidates but judge Catholic and judge the PAR and judge Pryor and several others are very much still in the mix the president wants to meet them see if they have a rapport and also see the public response to these reported meetings you mentioned a brick Cavanaugh Amy Kony Barrett those are the two Robert Koster they're suggesting maybe getting the most conversation Susan let me ask you if this is going to go down a Republican at least one of them would have to vote against this so Susan Collins has now stepped forward and has suggested that she could be that Republican and the issue in that case would be Roe versus Wade says if somebody expresses hostility she could be a no vote I'm looking at a senator though in Susan Collins who's voted for Sam Alito she voted for John Roberts and she voted for Neal gorsek so if that's the standard of who she's willing to find acceptable or any of these names we're talking about now going to plausibly reach unacceptable to her probably not because if it is party line votes she doesn't want her legacy to be that of something she cares about the woman who led to the overturn of roe v wade that being said however I don't think that it's going to fall strictly on party lines I think that we will see a couple of Democrats probably go over like Joe Manchin or O'Donnell or Donnelly excuse me sorry about that and maybe even Jones from from Alabama I mean he's got heat from the that will end up giving her cover to potentially do ANOVA but just to follow up on on what Robert said I think it's completely possible to see a wild card that we never saw coming trump has really been out there kind of running his own shop lately and the idea that he would look for someone who would be a loyalist to him knowing that Muller is coming down the pike I think is very much well in the realm of possibility is ralina from the standpoint of democrats who are looking to stop this thing and looking to find a Republican vote there how much hope do you think they can or should take from what susan collins is saying look I don't think that we got to put our hopes on hope just for lack of a better expression because I think that in this particular moment with so many things on the line voting rights women's rights workers rights affirmative action you have to fight even if you know you ultimately will lose and so I think that it's not just about getting that one Republican it's really calling those Democrats they're in moderate states like doug jones and joe Manchin and also making sure to call Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and ensure that they are going to vote against this particular person or at least delayed until after the midterm elections going by space on the Mitch McConnell rule and not just because Mitch McConnell set this precedent but also because there are two additional arguments that I think are pretty persuasive one you are replacing Kennedy who is the swing vote it's not Antonin Scalia like previously when you had Merrick garland sitting there and Mitch McConnell not even having a hearing you're not replacing a conservative with a conservative placing or a swing vote who is conservative with you know potentially a very extreme or conservative person his list is all people who we we have an understanding are in opposition to Roe you know Amy Barnett is a went to Notre Dame she is very Catholic she had a famous moment with former senator Al Franken during her hearings about how she spoke essentially to a hate group but without really under standing the full context there but additionally as Robert said the president is under investigation and so this particular judge that he is nominating to have a hearing in the Senate is someone that's going to determine his fate in the legal context and so I think Democrats are not just fighting about all of the different rights workers rights gay rights women's rights they also need to focus on the fact that this is replacing the swing vote and the president is under investigation and this person is going to determine his fate well in terms of the emerging Democratic opposition or the strategy at least in an op-ed in today's New York Times Chuck Schumer the minority leader in the Senate made the Democratic case against a potential Trump nominee quote if you do not want a Supreme Court justice who will overturn Roe vs. Wade and undo the Affordable Care Act tell your senators they should not vote for a candidate from mr. Trump's preordained list meanwhile on Sunday senator Maria Cantwell of Washington state warned her colleagues about the stakes of a Supreme Court vote I think that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know that this vote could be a one of the key votes of their entire career and they know that no matter what spin comes out of the White House if they vote for somebody who's going to change precedent it could be a career-ending move it Susan I'm trying to figure out how the the Democratic base and we heard in the clips there we heard Zerlina go through the issues that most animate the Democratic base now and then I think it's illogical to assume are going to lead the vast majority of Senate Democrats to vote against this but then you've got that group of Democrats you were mentioning them before a Joe Manchin in West Virginia Donnelly in Indiana height camp out in North Dakota the incentives the political incentives for them might work differently well and it that's true and they may also realize it's an interesting problem for the demos Democrats because yes they want to keep their jobs but they're also supposed to represent their constituency many of the ones you just mentioned are red states that Donald Trump won so that will be that's also something to take into consideration and any chance that the Democrats have of taking the Senate relies on those three getting reelected so it depends really how how the Democrats kind of treat each other they're gonna have to duke this out Robert Costa what is your sense of in terms of what the White House is ultimately looking here that the considerations driving this I've seen suggestions you know that Trump thinks of the evangelical Christian base that stuck with him in 2016 thinks of this as an issue of particular importance to them wants to deliver to them we've talked here about the possibility of some kind of wildcard well where is his mind is it on how easy it would be to confirm the person and make sure you get Susan Collins in line for this where do you think the priority Falls there you're looking at someone with an extensive judicial record because they want to make sure that this nominee could be confirmed before the midterm elections important news today to pay attention to the White House announced it's going to set up a war room Don McGann the White House Counsel Raja spokesmen they're starting to already assemble the coming political war over this confirmation and you have Dom McGann reaching out to people like Senator Mike Lee on Capitol Hill who's another possible wildcard pick but really when you look at Kavanagh Koni Barrett those federal judges are the kind of people the White House believes could both excite the base because of their judicial positions but also be able to sail through relatively easy but as I was reporting today's Steve the Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has expressed concerns to his associates privately in his advisers the Kavanagh may not hit win his support he hasn't taken a public position but because of Cavanaugh's writings on the Affordable Care Act these kind of issues are already coming up beyond just the issues with Senator Collins and senator Mitch McConnell meanwhile the Republican leader in the Senate he is calling for a vote on trumps yet a name pick by this fall last week Politico reported the Senate number two Republican John Cornyn was calling for a vote after Labor Day the article noted that quote the Supreme Court the Supreme Court nominee since the Ford administration spent an average of 67 days between their nomination and final confirmation and I think it was somewhere in the 60s for Gorsuch last year Republicans ended up killing off the filibuster to get him through but Zelena in terms of an outcome here for if Republicans have the votes on paper and they've got those Democrats in those Trump State seats that who voted for corsets we already saw three haven't vote for Gorsuch last year is the best case in your mind for Democrats here manat going to get Republicans to flip over E is the best case that it fires up their base enough to help them in November to somehow flip the Senate after that yes absolutely and I think that that's the calculation I think you fight even though even if you don't win and the base is with you what we saw over the weekend I mean it's not getting as much attention as I thought it would but there were massive protests over the weekend the base keeps coming out into the streets and they're gonna continue to do that I think it's a good predictor in terms of them going out in and voting because if you're if you're willing to you know whatever is going on in your life your kids your job all of that but you're taking the time on a Saturday or a Sunday to go outside and express your opposition to this administration then you're very likely to also go outside and vote in November and just one thing to add is Millennials have never had to see this as an issue right in their lifetime especially roe v wade so we don't know what they're going to do we know that they've definitely have a horrible view of the Republican Party so if there's a way of tapping into that and actually if they are as motivated as we think they are that could prove the conservative base that we took so much about the enthusiasm gap or we've seen Democrats coming out in these elections we've seen Democrats protesting you know we know the administration was actually hoping Democrats would start talking about impeachment why to get that conservative base mobilized if you've got a court fight here could it have that same mobilizing effect here's the problem you look at that argument the Republican base turns out they know what the numbers are so Republicans have been focused on this is the number I need to win that on the Democratic side and we saw this in New York in the primaries with more than one seat when you don't know who's showing up to vote it doesn't pull the same and you can get a much wider diverse turnout than you can ever expect we've seen it in 2017 we've seen numbers thirty forty percent in districts County exec races here in New York increase on the Democratic side so that's what's the unpredictable part the Republican side is very predictable when they're not good they're not going to appeal to
