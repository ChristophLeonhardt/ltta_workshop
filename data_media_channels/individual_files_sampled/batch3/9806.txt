I TALKED TO THE OTTO WARMBIER FAMILY YESTERDAY. OTTO WAS ON OUR MINDS. THESE THREE WERE COMING HOME. HE SAID WE ARE HAPPY FOR THE HOSTAGES AND THEIR FAMILY AND HE SAID WE MISS OTTO. Neil: HAD TO BE BITTERSWEET FOR OTTO'S PARENTS LOOKING AT THIS AND THE THREE HOSTAGES THAT DID RUSH HEALTHY, HAPPY AND RELIEVED. THE WOMAN THAT TALKED TO THEM, THE CO HOST OF "FOX AND FRIENDS," AINSLEY EARHARDT. TAKING ABOUT INSPIRATIONAL, IT'S DOMINATING THE BEST SELLER LIST. CONGRATULATIONS. THANKS, NEIL. YOU'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED MY CAREER. Neil: GRUDGINGLY. I'M SO JEALOUS. ONE THING ABOUT THE BOOK. I WANTED TO READ IT, BUT HOW FREELY AND HAPPY YOU ARE TO TALK ABOUT GOD, TO TALK ABOUT RELIGION, TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FAITH. THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE FORBIDDEN TODAY. WHEN THEY APPROACHED ME ABOUT WRITING THIS BOOK, THEY SAID DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FAITH? THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HEAR OFTEN. I HAD TO SAY YES TO THAT. DID DID TWO CHILDRENS BOOKS. I WAS GOING TO TAKE A VACATION. I NEED TO BREATHE A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I'M A MOTHER AND WORKING FULL TIME AND AN AUTHOR. THE BOOK TOUR IS WONDERFUL BECAUSE YOU GET TO MEET YOUR THE PEOPLE THAT WATCH US EVERY DAY AND PUT FOOD ON OUR TABLE AND WE HUG THEM AND SAY THANK YOU. BUT IT CAN BE EXHAUSTING AT TIMES. I FELT LIKE I HAD TO SAY YES TO THAT. HOW CAN YOU SAY NO TO GOD? TELL YOUR STORY ABOUT GOD. OKAY. Neil: YOU KEPT THAT YOU RIGHT AWAY YOU SAY I DEDICATE THIS BOOK TO MY LORD AND SAVE YOUR JESUS CHRIST. I KNOW I'LL HAVE AN ETERNAL LIFE WITH CHRIST. ALMOST EVERY CHAPTER YOU TAKE A PAGE FROM THE BIBLE. AGAIN AND AGAIN, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THIS ROUGH AND TUMBLE WORLD OF JOURNALISM AND SAY NASTY THINGS. YOU DON'T FOLLOW THAT TEMPTATION. I FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN THIS WEIGHT ON MY HEART THROUGH THIS LATEST POLITICAL CHALLENGE. IF YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEONE ELSE, YOU'RE HATED. SO I DON'T LIKE THAT. I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT IS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY. I FEEL LIKE THE MAJORITY WANTS TO BE HAPPY AND POSITIVE AND I THINK THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A BOOK LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT DOES REMIND YOU THAT GOD IS IN CONTROL AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE BLACK OR WHITE OR A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN OR Neil: BUT YOU SAID, LIKE WOW, THIS IS REALLY I WANT TO SAY, I LOVE YOU AROUND YOUR GOD'S CHILD. WHOEVER IS WRITING THIS ARTICLE DIDN'T REACH OUT TO ME. IF THEY DID, I KNEW IT WOULD BE A NEGATIVE ARTICLE. WE GET ATTACKED ALL THE TIME. SO I WANT TO SAY Neil: IT'S THE OTHERS. I WANT TO SAY, YOU DON'T KNOW US. IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE TO THROW STONES. WE ALL HAVE OUR ISSUES AND DOING THE BEST WE CAN. WE WANT TO SEND OUR KIDS TO COLLEGE. WE WANT TO PROVIDE A NICE LIFE FOR OUR CHILDREN. A SAFE LIFE. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU VOTE. Neil: I'M NOT LEAVING ANYTHING TO THE KIDS. I THINK THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN AND THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT. WE DIDN'T GROW UP WITH MUCH. Neil: YOU MENTIONED GROWING UP. YOUR DAD WAS VERY CHEAP IS NOT THE WORD BUT HE WATCHED EVERY PENNY. DIDN'T HAVE A CREDIT CARD. YOU GREW UP LIKE THAT. I DID. I AM GRATEFUL. AT THE TIME I LOOKED AT MY FRIENDS THAT HAD EVERYTHING. I WANTED THAT. BUT I'M SO GRATEFUL. MY DAD WORKED SO HARD, SOMETIMES THREE JOBS. WRITING THANK YOU NOTES TO HIS CUSTOMERS IN THE MIDNIGHT. HE GAVE UP HIS COACHING CAREER SO HE COULD SELL JANITORIAL SUPPLIES. TOILET PAPER. OUR SOAP IS ONE OF THE BRANDS THAT HE USED TO SELL. IT'S SUCH I REMEMBER COMING TO FOX AND SEEING THAT SANI SOAP AND THINKING, MY DAD SOLD THIS SO I COULD COME HERE. TOILET PAPER, CARPETS, ANYTHING AND TO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. WHEN YOU GO THE SCHOOLS AND THE BATHROOM, MY DAD SOLD THAT IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA. MY MOM WENT TO WORK EVERY DAY. SHE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE A STAY AT HOME MOM AND RAISE THREE KIDS. Neil: BUT YOU LOOK NOW, YOU SAY HEY, OUR FRIENDS ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU IN THE MORNING AND ON "FOX AND FRIENDS." NOW "FOX AND FRIENDS," PROBABLY THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SHOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE VERY BIG VIEWER. WE DO. Neil: HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? WE OPEN THE BOOK SAYING, YOU KNOW, MY FRIENDS ARE SAYING YOU'RE FAMOUS. I KNOW, IT'S SO WEIRD, MOM. Neil: DOES THAT PUT PRESSURE WHEN YOU TALK TO THE PRESIDENT? NO. I'M GOING TO BE MYSELF NO MATTER WHAT. I WANT TO BE GRACIOUS TO EVERY VIEWER, EVERY PERSON ON OUR SHOW. I REALIZE THEY'RE WAKING UP EARLY TO BE ON OUR SHOW. I WANT TO BE GRACIOUS BUT I WANT TO ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW, BE A JOURNALIST AS WELL. THAT PHRASE HAS CHANGED. A TV HOST. BUT I STILL WANT TO ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS. Neil: I WAS THINKING OF YOU, TOO. RIGHT AWAY YOU GET INTO THIS, ROGER AILES, OUR CHAIRMAN. YOU MENTIONED HIM IN YOUR BOOK. YOU SAID ROGER'S FALL REMINDS YOU HOW FRAGILE LIFE IS. NOT JUST PHYSICAL EXISTENCE BUT OUR INTEGRITY AND REPUTATION. AND MANY PUT DOWN PRESIDENT PENCE BECAUSE WHEN HE DOESN'T GO OUT TO EAT. YOU SAID HE DOES PUT WALLS AROUND HIS INTEGRITY TO GUARD HIMSELF AGAINST THE APPEARANCE OF EVIL. IF WE CHANGE OURSELVES, IT CONTINUES TODAY. FOR THE BETTER. I'M RAISING A DAUGHTER. I WANT US TO CHANGE AND EVOLVE FROM WHERE WE WERE. DID IT BREAK ANY HEART WHEN ROGER PASSED AWAY? YES. I FEEL LIKE THAT SIN ERODED AND CORRUPTED HIS LIFE AND CHANGED HIS LIFE AND TOOK HIS LIFE. YOU NEVER EXPERIENCED THAT. I NEVER EXPERIENCED THAT. MY STORY IS DIFFERENT FROM THESE WOMEN. I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I HEARD THIS. OUR WORLD WAS TURNED UPSIDE-DOWN HERE AT FOX. HE DID PUT FOOD ON MY TABLE. HE HIRED ME. HE ALLOWED MY DREAMS TO COME TRUE. THEN I HEAR STORIES THAT INVOLVE MY FRIENDS HERE AT FAX. I WAS APPALLED. IT WAS WRONG. BUT YOU KNOW, I DID FEEL SORRY FOR HIS FAMILY AND IT ULTIMATELY KILLED HIM. Neil: AND YOU MOVED ON.
