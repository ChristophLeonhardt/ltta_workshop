so today is Saturday and I haven't
spared intellect since Wednesday raise
Jana and I are meeting in the middle and
we haven't spoken since Wednesday and
it's now Saturday and I am taking my big
fancy camera let's do this
Alexa Mize middle is in Tooting it's the
Tooting Broadway station so it's here I
actually grew up over this side which is
where Alex is coming from I went to
school there and everything but I now
live over East London side and West Town
play around here as well so we're gonna
walk for a while then I read up on the
cheap the first but it's a good bite
dishonor because of the ways that would
just be wrong
goodbye lies on earth so that we go it's
a beautiful day but probably not for
long I'm going to walk to the station
and then I'm going to capture train and
then I think I'm gonna walk the rest of
the way unless I'm horribly late
feel like Bill and Ben the flag woman
right now so far it's all been pretty
familiar because I sometimes run down as
nothing like it I live in a walking City
and for a transfer city so for like I
have covered quite a lot ground
they always have great new installations
and things like that
let's just keep going from that
it
such a people of the theater my favorite
been winding
I guess the joke would be to that you're
never going to be able to know all of it
which is fun
don't you everything to put on light
loads of nice talk to shops instead I'm
just rushing the whole time now I'm on
time
plenty of time to get there my work so
now I have to film and not be in danger
of being really late
because I'm a really naturally anxious
person I'm convinced that rosianna will
forgotten and won't show up those who
haven't spoken a few days
yeah sure she'll be very impressed I
don't know why because I'm showering up
oh yeah don't know it just feels weird
and risky sorry I'm kind of had to let
go a bit the next station is Pennington
got a little bit ahead of time I think
me that early maybe I should slow down I
hate will conserve it
boy oh break
I'm gonna ask our
I'm gonna be early if I keep walking so
I sat down on a bench
this is the middle
to the minister
to bat for the star
flex is already
now we can go I'm like oddly nervous
which is really where doesn't make any
sense
it would be so hilarious and dumb if
after waiting to make sure I wasn't
early I was late final minute
feels really creepy watching for someone
else blog I don't know when she's gonna
notice me but there she is I'm gonna
creep up on her
I'd like it's a weird feeling that you
were going to do that to me
did you know when you let in Starbucks
up now I won't walked all the way from
sorry
no I didn't I am Golf the Train like to
tube stops up and walked this statue is
that a wizard was it
Venga we have each other
