These tents represent the
first camp of its kind:
a temporary facility used
to house unaccompanied
migrant children between
the ages of 13 and 17.
The tent camp
wasn’t always here.
It was set up in June at this
facility, right on the U.S. side
of the border with Mexico.
No reporters have been inside.
A bipartisan group of mayors
who gathered at the facility
were also denied access.
But by looking at
aerial imagery,
this is what we found out:
The small tent camp is
located within a port
of entry facility in Tornillo,
Tex., which opened in 2014.
The facility is surrounded
by a barbed-wire fence.
Beyond that are vast fields.
The small town of Tornillo
is four miles away.
El Paso is 40 miles
to the northwest.
It’s not the first
time migrants
have been housed here.
A temporary holding
facility for families
was set up here in 
November 2016
as seen on 
these satellite images.
It was removed in April 2017.
New tents first appeared
on June 10 this year.
There are now 32 tents total.
One small tent holds 10
bunk beds — 18 of these tents
are set up here to house
up to 360 teenagers.
Temperatures can reach
over 100 degrees,
so the tents are
air-conditioned.
There are mobile bathrooms,
a food hall, a medical tent
and other support structures.
By June 20,
a soccer field was set up.
Otherwise, there’s not much
for the detainees to do.
It costs more than twice as
much to care for children
at temporary shelters
like the one in Tornillo
than at permanent shelters.
But these makeshift facilities
could become more common
if a zero tolerance
policy continues
to be enforced at the border.
