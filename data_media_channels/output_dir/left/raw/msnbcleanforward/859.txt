IN THE TWO HURRICANES THAT HIT PUERTO RICO.

19
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:32,999
PUERTO RICO. WHEN I LEFT THE ISLAND, AFTER

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,667
WHEN I LEFT THE ISLAND, AFTER THE STORM HAD HIT, THEY HAD

21
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:37,604
THE STORM HAD HIT, THEY HAD ANYWHERE FROM 6 TO 18 DEATHS.

22
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:39,172
ANYWHERE FROM 6 TO 18 DEATHS. AS TIME WENT BY, IT DID NOT GO

23
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:40,173
AS TIME WENT BY, IT DID NOT GO UP BY MUCH.

24
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:42,475
UP BY MUCH. THEN, A LONG TIME LATER, THEY

25
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:44,778
THEN, A LONG TIME LATER, THEY STARTED TO REPORT REALLY LARGE

26
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,913
STARTED TO REPORT REALLY LARGE NUMBERS, LIKE 3,000.

27
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:48,782
NUMBERS, LIKE 3,000. THE PRESIDENT BLAMED DEMOCRATS

THE PRESIDENT BLAMED DEMOCRATS WHO YOU SAID WANTED TO, QUOTE,

29
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,821
WHO YOU SAID WANTED TO, QUOTE, MAKE ME LOOK BAD AS POSSIBLE

30
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,590
MAKE ME LOOK BAD AS POSSIBLE WHEN I WAS SUCCESSFULLY RAISING

31
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,326
WHEN I WAS SUCCESSFULLY RAISING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HELP

32
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,460
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HELP REBUILD PUERTO RICO.

33
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:02,095
REBUILD PUERTO RICO. IF A PERSON DIED FOR ANY REASON

34
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:04,832
IF A PERSON DIED FOR ANY REASON LIKE OLD AGE, ADD THEM ON TO

35
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:05,365
LIKE OLD AGE, ADD THEM ON TO THAT LIST.

36
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,500
THAT LIST. WE SHOULD EXPLAIN THAT NUMBER

37
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,036
WE SHOULD EXPLAIN THAT NUMBER CAME OUT AFTER RESEARCHERS, NOT

38
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,871
CAME OUT AFTER RESEARCHERS, NOT POLITICIANS, RESEARCHERS, LOOKED

39
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,039
POLITICIANS, RESEARCHERS, LOOKED AT THE PUERTO RICAN POPULATION

40
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,908
AT THE PUERTO RICAN POPULATION BEFORE AND AFTER THE STORM.

41
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,944
BEFORE AND AFTER THE STORM. USING HISTORICAL MODELS, THEY

42
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:18,612
USING HISTORICAL MODELS, THEY ACCOUNTED FOR PEOPLE THAT DIED

43
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:20,147
ACCOUNTED FOR PEOPLE THAT DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES AND FOR PEOPLE

44
00:01:20,182 --> 00:01:21,482
OF NATURAL CAUSES AND FOR PEOPLE THAT FLOOD THE ISLAND.

45
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:25,152
THAT FLOOD THE ISLAND. THAT LEFT THEM WITH AN ESTIMATED

46
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:26,954
THAT LEFT THEM WITH AN ESTIMATED 2,975 DEATHS THAT RESEARCHERS

47
00:01:26,988 --> 00:01:27,988
2,975 DEATHS THAT RESEARCHERS NOW BELIEVE COULD HAVE BEEN

48
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:29,757
NOW BELIEVE COULD HAVE BEEN LINKED TO THE STORM.

49
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,826
LINKED TO THE STORM. BY THE WAY, THE REPORT, AS I

50
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,327
BY THE WAY, THE REPORT, AS I MENTIONED, WAS NOT THE WORK OF

51
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:33,661
MENTIONED, WAS NOT THE WORK OF DEMOCRATS.

52
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:35,730
DEMOCRATS. IT WAS CONDUCTED BY PEOPLE FROM

00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:42,164
COVERS THIS MORNING? IT’S PURE IGNORANCE TO SAY THE

HAVE PEOPLE DRINKING WATER FROM CONTAMINATED STREAMS.

103
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:59,514
CONTAMINATED STREAMS. THE PRESIDENT COULD TIP HIS HAT

104
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:01,049
THE PRESIDENT COULD TIP HIS HAT SAYING FEMA WAS HANDING OUT

105
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,150

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,931
THERE’S A RESIGNATION INSIDE OF THIS WEST WING.

114
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,366
THIS WEST WING. THE TOP ECHELONS OF THE

00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,000
THE TOP ECHELONS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

116
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:21,036
REPUBLICAN PARTY. THAT NO ONE CAN PUSH PRESIDENT

117
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:22,370
THAT NO ONE CAN PUSH PRESIDENT TRUMP TOWARDS THE REALITY OF

00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:23,504
TRUMP TOWARDS THE REALITY OF WHAT’S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND

119
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,839
WHAT’S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND AND HE ONLY SEES THINGS THROUGH

00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:32,080
AND HE ONLY SEES THINGS THROUGH THE PRISON OF HIMSELF.

121
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:32,847
THE PRISON OF HIMSELF. ADVISERS HAVE MOSTLY GIVEN UP IN

122
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:33,882
ADVISERS HAVE MOSTLY GIVEN UP IN TRYING TO PULL HIM BACK FROM

123
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:36,017
TRYING TO PULL HIM BACK FROM THESE KINDS OF OUTBURSTS.

124
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:37,552
THESE KINDS OF OUTBURSTS. >> THE PRESIDENT’S BASE MIGHT

125
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:39,254
>> THE PRESIDENT’S BASE MIGHT SAY WHO CARES ABOUT PUERTO RICO,

126
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:40,956
SAY WHO CARES ABOUT PUERTO RICO, THEY’RE OUR NEIGHBOR.

127
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:46,261
THEY’RE OUR NEIGHBOR. I THINK SANTORUM CALLING PUERTO

128
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:46,895
I THINK SANTORUM CALLING PUERTO RICO A COUNTRY WHEN IT’S

129
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:47,896
RICO A COUNTRY WHEN IT’S HUMILIATEING FOR HIM TO SAY IT’S

130
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,964
HUMILIATEING FOR HIM TO SAY IT’S A COUNTRY WHEN WE KNOW IT’S A

131
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:50,399
A COUNTRY WHEN WE KNOW IT’S A U.S. TERRITORY.

132
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:54,236
U.S. TERRITORY. FROM A POPULARITY PERSPECTIVE,

133
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,904
FROM A POPULARITY PERSPECTIVE, BESIDES HIS CORE BASE WHO’S

134
00:03:55,938 --> 00:03:57,572
BESIDES HIS CORE BASE WHO’S SAYING, WELL, IT DOESN’T HELP ME

135
00:03:57,607 --> 00:03:58,874
SAYING, WELL, IT DOESN’T HELP ME OR MY NEIGHBORS.

136
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,108
OR MY NEIGHBORS. WHO ON EARTH HEARS PRESIDENT

137
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:01,576
WHO ON EARTH HEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAY THAT AND GETS BEHIND

138
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:01,877
TRUMP SAY THAT AND GETS BEHIND HIM?

139
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:02,978
HIM? WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

140
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,780
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. EVEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE

141
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:06,515
EVEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO FLED

142
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:07,716
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO FLED PUERTO RICO AND MOVED TO PLACES

143
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:09,518
PUERTO RICO AND MOVED TO PLACES LIKE FLORIDA, TEXAS AND

144
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:09,985
LIKE FLORIDA, TEXAS AND NEW YORK.

145
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:13,388
NEW YORK. THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

146
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:15,090
THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT FROM

147
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:16,892
VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT FROM PUERTO RICO BUT THEY CAN WHEN

148
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:17,525
PUERTO RICO BUT THEY CAN WHEN THEY LIVE HERE.

149
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:18,494
THEY LIVE HERE. >> THEY’RE AMERICANS.

150
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:20,829
>> THEY’RE AMERICANS. THEY’RE HUMAN BEINGS.

151
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,732
THEY’RE HUMAN BEINGS. THERE’S PLATEA POLITICAL COST HE

152
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,100
THERE’S PLATEA POLITICAL COST HE A GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATED NOT

153
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:26,835
A GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATED NOT JUST HOW IT HANDLES THE STORM

154
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,704
JUST HOW IT HANDLES THE STORM BUT HOW IT HANDLES THE MESSAGE

155
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:30,105
BUT HOW IT HANDLES THE MESSAGE DURING THE STORM.

156
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:32,207
DURING THE STORM. IS THE PRESIDENT SHOWING

157
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:32,541
IS THE PRESIDENT SHOWING EMPATHY?

158
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:34,710
EMPATHY? IS HE SHOWING ASSERTIVENESS IN

159
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:35,644
IS HE SHOWING ASSERTIVENESS IN HANDLING THE SITUATION?

160
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:37,713
HANDLING THE SITUATION? YOU HAVE SUBURBAN VOTERS ACROSS

161
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:38,847
YOU HAVE SUBURBAN VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WATCHING THIS VERY

162
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:39,148
THE COUNTRY WATCHING THIS VERY CLOSELY.

163
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:40,616
CLOSELY. THE STORM MAY NOT BE HITTING

164
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,650
