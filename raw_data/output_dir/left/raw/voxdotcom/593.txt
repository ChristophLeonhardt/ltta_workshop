1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,970
Your body is a temple, but it’s also a museum
of natural history.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,300
Look closely and you’ll see parts that aren’t
there because you need them

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,690
but because your animal ancestors did.
No longer serving their previous function

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:19,090
but not costly enough to have disappeared,
these remnants of our deep history only make

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,290
sense within the framework of evolution by
natural selection.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,619
With your arm on a flat surface, push your
thumb against your pinky and tip your hand

7
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,000
slightly up.
If you see a raised band in the middle of

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,719
the wrist, you’ve got a vestigial muscle
in your forearm.

9
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,530
That tendon you see connects to the palmaris
longus,

10
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,070
a muscle that around 10-15% of people are missing
on one or both of their arms.

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,670
It doesn’t make them any weaker though.
There’s no difference in grip strength.

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,809
In fact, it’s one of the first tendons that
surgeons will take out so they can use it

13
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:00,920
in reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries.
You can find the palmaris longus across mammal

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,650
species, but it’s most developed among those
that use their forelimbs to move around.

15
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:11,000
In primates, that means the muscle is longer
in lemurs and monkeys and shorter in chimps,

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,270
gorillas, and other apes that don’t do a
lot of scrambling through trees.

17
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,640
It’s not the only leftover muscle that we've got. Look
at the three that are attached to our outer

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,240
ear.
We can’t get much movement out of these

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,280
muscles, especially compared to some of our
mammal relatives who use them to locate the

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,250
sources of sounds.
Presumably this would have been quite helpful

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,850
for early nocturnal mammals.
In humans, you can still detect the remnants

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,970
of this adaptation with electrodes.
In one study researchers recorded a spike

23
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:43,020
of activity in the ear muscle cells in response
to a sudden sound. Not enough to move the

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,350
ear, but detectable.
And you can probably guess the location of

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,000
the sound based on the results - it came from
a speaker to the left of the study subjects.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,100
So this is their left ear subconsciously trying
(and failing) to pivot toward the sound.

27
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,550
You can see another futile effort by our vestigial
body parts when you get goosebumps.

28
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,230
When we’re cold, tiny muscles attached to
our body hairs contract, pulling the hair

29
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,439
upright which causes the surrounding skin
to form a bump.

30
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,599
For our furry mammal relatives, the raised
hair increases the amount of space for insulation,

31
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,780
helping them stay warm.
Birds can do this too. you’ve probably seen

32
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,230
a puffy pigeon on a cold day.
Adrenaline is one of the hormones involved

33
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,519
in the body’s response to cold temperatures,
and it’s also part of the fight or flight

34
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,489
response.
So it helps some animals appear larger when

35
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:34,269
they’re threatened.
And it may be why surprising and emotional

36
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:39,480
turns in music can give some people goosebumps.
And then there’s our tail. At the end of

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,010
our spine are a set of fused vertebrae - some
people have 3, some have 5. We call it the

38
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,799
tailbone.
It now serves as an anchor for some pelvic

39
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:51,879
muscles but it’s also what’s left of our
ancestors’ tails.

40
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,939
Every one of us actually had a tail at one
point. When the basic body plan is being laid

41
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:01,480
out at around 4 weeks of gestation, humans
embryos closely resemble embryos of other

42
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,019
vertebrates.
And that includes a tail with 10-12 developing

43
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,010
vertebrae.
In many other animals it continues to develop

44
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,609
into a proper tail.
But in humans and other apes, the cells in

45
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,730
the tail are programmed to die a few weeks
after they appear.

46
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,359
Vary rarely though, a mutation allows the
ancestral blueprint to prevail and a human

47
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:25,719
baby will be born with a true vestigial tail.

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,280
The most adorable vestigial behavior is the

49
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,680
palmar grasp reflex, where infants up until
they’re about 6 months old have this incredible

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,900
grasp on whatever you put in their hand. There’s
a similar reflex for their feet. I wanted

51
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,370
to show you this great piece of footage from
the 1930s where they demonstrated this behavior.

52
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,480
These babies are only 1 month old and you
can see that their inner monkey can support

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:00:00,000
their entire weight.
