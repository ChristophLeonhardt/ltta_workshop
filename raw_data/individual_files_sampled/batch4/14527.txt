because I'm in this comic book world on the internet I saw an adult comic series and they came out with Batman nude and they showed his parts and it's quite distinctive I'm not sure if I can show this on YouTube but I'll try to do my best maybe blurt out a little pit but you get the idea just check this out I mean I don't even know why this is a thing who wants this who wants to see cartoon penis Batman's penis I mean they started out with nipples on his suit and now they're just stripping him down and and this is real I mean this is real this is what's happening I don't know wants to see this I mean don't boys look at comic books why the heck do guys want to see that III don't know I don't know who's looking at this and girls I don't know girls are reading this or looking at this but I mean really and it's really funny because they say that comic skaters are sexist because they draw beautiful women and the left are trying to say that it's sexist and misogynistic but yet they're doing stuff like this and then another article says that reports of Batman's penis have been greatly overhyped this week marks the launch of Batman damned number one from master story tells Brian Azzarello and liebe armejo in the lead-up to the release the comics community was buzzing over one major element of the issue the full frontal nudity the full frontal bat nudity let's make some things clear I'm not disparaging Batman's penis as it appears in Batman damned number one as an aspect of character design I have no problems here in regards to length girth or shape what I am criticizing in my full professional capacity as comics editor of polygons is the presentation of Batman's penis I reached the end of Batman number one expectantly waiting for the Batman's penis panel and had to turn right around and look for it again when I was done okay so they're not saying they were disappointed in the penis they were just saying it was subtly there that they barely even noticed it and had to go back and look at it and I must admit when I saw the image I didn't really notice it either I had to keep looking at it and go oh I see and let's be clear Batman surely swings far right that man's penis is on display and three panels of Batman damn number one in which Batman is flipped from behind his features heavily in shadow in each panel a faint gentle line of Lieber may hose pen gives us just the barest silhouette outline of Batman's penis it is clearly to be seen so long as you are really looking for it specifically and not just you know reading the comic like The Dark Knight himself crouched on some rain-swept gargoyle or looming in the dark corners of a crime scene his penises depicted almost entirely hidden in shadow so as it turns out distinctive penises are all the rage in the news right now from our president to Batman which could possibly be the same thing let me know what you guys think in the comments is this news if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
