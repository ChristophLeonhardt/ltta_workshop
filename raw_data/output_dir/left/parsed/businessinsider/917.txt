sleep has different stages if you do an
eg of a person there are four stages of
sleep and then there is a separate sleep
called a REM sleep rapid eye movement
sleep and the dreaming happens in the
rapid eye movement sleep okay and it's
that portion of the sleep where you sort
of go into paralysis and if you wouldn't
go into paralysis you would be acting on
your dream you'll be jumping around
doing things people who use marijuana
they tend to suppress REM sleep they
have less REM sleep and when they have
less REM sleep you're going to have less
drinks because dreams only happen during
REM sleep so for a long time people
didn't recognize this but once people
stopped smoking
certainly there's a rebound phenomena
where people can have quite vivid dreams
