1
00:00:01,317 --> 00:00:03,753
OTHER LAME LINE OF ATTACK

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:06,055
AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS

3
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:07,423
HOPEFUL VERY OPTIMISTIC

4
00:00:07,423 --> 00:00:07,824
SUPPORTERS.

5
00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:10,326
AND THAT'S THE ANGLE.

6
00:00:10,326 --> 00:00:12,895
JOINING ME NOW TO REACT RIGHT

7
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:15,932
HERE ON FOX NEWS, HOWARD CURT

8
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,767
AND DICK MORRIS.

9
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,035
I'M BEEN DYING TO TALK TO ALL I

10
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:20,970
DON'T HAVE YOU GUYS TODAY ABOUT

11
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,271
THIS BECAUSE WHEN I STARTED

12
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:23,873
HEARING THIS MEME THIS WEEK,

13
00:00:23,873 --> 00:00:26,309
"OH, IT'S THE CULT OF TRUMP,"

14
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,044
THEY TRIED TO SAY HE WAS DUMB,

15
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:29,245
HE HAD DEMENTIA.

16
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:30,847
REMEMBER THAT LAST YEAR?

17
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:33,583
THEY NEEDED TO REMOVE HIM FROM

18
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:33,950
OFFICE.

19
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,520
LIKE THE CABINET HAD TO BE

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,223
ACTIVATED.

21
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:51,167
DICK MORRIS, YOU'VE SEEN THE --

22
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,201
>>I THINK HIS POLICY IS

23
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:52,568
CRUCIAL.

24
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:54,537
BUT I THINK THE THING ABOUT HIS

25
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:56,572
PERSONALITY THAT IS CAPTURING

26
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:58,975
PEOPLE IS THAT HE'S CONGRUENT

27
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,777
WITH WHAT PEOPLE WANT.

28
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:04,212
WE WANT THE PRESIDENT TO GET

29
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:06,916
STUFF DONE WITHOUT WAFFLING OR

30
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:07,717
WITH WINDS BLOWING.

31
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:08,618
AND TRUMP IS A BUILDER.

32
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:10,720
HE'S A DEVELOPER.

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,188
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

34
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:14,123
HE GETS IT BUILT.

35
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:16,259
AND WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT KOREA OR

36
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,827
THE ECONOMY, THE CRITICS ALL SAY

37
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,363
HE CAN'T DO IT, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

38
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:22,031
BUT THEN HE GETS IT DONE.

39
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:23,633
HE IMPLEMENTS IT.

40
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,201
EVEN AFTER IT'S DONE, THEY STILL

41
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,336
SAY HE DIDN'T DO IT OR IT'LL

42
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:28,204
COME APART.

43
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:32,875
AND THAT CREATES A REAL SENSE

44
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,677
THAT THIS GUY IS SOMEONE TO

45
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,914
FOLLOW BECAUSE HE GETS IT DONE.

46
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:40,716
IT'S THE SAME CONCEPT THAT

47
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:43,052
INSPIRED REAGAN AND EVEN

48
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:46,155
CHURCHILL SUPPORTERS, THAT WE

49
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:47,690
DON'T CARE IF HE LEFT OR RIGHT,

50
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,926
WE LOVE THE WAY HE ACTS, THE WAY

51
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:54,397
HE GETS IT DONE AND EXPRESSES

52
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:56,599
OUR INNERMOST DESIRES ABOUT WHAT

53
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,634
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO FOR US.

54
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:01,637
>>  HE'S UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT HIS

55
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:04,340
DESIRE AND IMPATIENCE FOR CHANGE

56
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,441
FOR AMERICAN WORKERS.

57
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:07,710
THAT'S JUST REFRESHING.

58
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,610
YOU'VE BEEN AROUND WASHINGTON

59
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:15,117
FOR SONG.

60
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:17,653
IT'S REFRESHING TO HEAR SOMEONE

61
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:17,954
TODAY.

62
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:20,256
WHAT DID HE SPEND, LIKE 45

63
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:25,261
MINUTES WITH ANSWERING QUESTIONS

64
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,462
JUST OUT IN THE DRIVEWAY.

65
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:27,597
I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.

66
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:31,601
BUT YOU JUST WROTE A PIECE ABOUT

67
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:35,037
THE SUPPOSED CULT PHENOMENON.

68
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:38,574
SO TELL US YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT

69
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:47,316
WHERE THE REAL CULT ME  --

70
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,855
>>THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD FOLLOW

71
00:02:52,855 --> 00:02:56,459
SUCH A LEADER ARE MINDLESS,

72
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,094
DELUSIONAL WHACK JOBS.

73
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:03,399
THERE'S A SENSE HERE, IT'S ONLY

74
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:06,669
ABOUT 15 SECONDS ON THE GOOGLE

75
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,771
TO FIND NEW YORK TIMES EDITORIAL

76
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,642
LAST WEEK, THE CULT OF TRUMP.

77
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:13,943
NATIONAL JOURNAL LAST YEAR.

78
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,846
I GET THE IDEA THAT THIS IS

79
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:17,914
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN

80
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:18,381
PARTY.

81
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:20,016
AND WHETHER OUT OF LOYALTY OR

82
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:21,817
OUT OF FEAR, MANY REPUBLICANS

83
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:22,685
ARE FALLING INTO LINE.

84
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:26,856
BUT TO CALL IT A CULT, AND NO

85
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:28,824
ONE GETS UPSET ABOUT IT.

86
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:31,627
THEY STILL DON'T QUITE GRASP

87
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:32,295
TRUMP'S APPEAL.

88
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,931
>>  IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO ME THAT

89
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,566
NOW A YEAR AND A HALF INTO THIS,

90
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:40,636
HIS NUMBERS ARE GOING UP,

91
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:42,538
MUELLER'S ARE GOING DOWN.

92
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:45,174
ALL THE MEASURES THAT WE TALKED

93
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:45,608
ABOUT.

94
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:50,513
CONFIDENCE IS UP, A POSSIBLE

95
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:56,886
DENUCLEARIZED KOREA.

96
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:58,321
I JUST HAD TO PLAY SOMETHING

97
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,390
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO

98
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,793
LOVE THIS.

99
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:05,995
LINDSEY GRAHAM TODAY WAS BEING

100
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,296
CRITICIZED FOR ACTUALLY WORKING

101
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,798
WITH TRUMP.

102
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:09,565
LET'S WATCH.

103
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:11,233
>>  I LIKE THE PRESIDENT.

104
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:14,837
I TRUST HIM IN TERMS OF TRYING

105
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,505
TO DO THINGS THAT ARE BIG AND

106
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:17,839
MATTER.

107
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,810
>>  BUT PEOPLE SAY THIS IS

108
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,177
TWO-FACED.

109
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,077
WHERE AT THE GRAHAM OF STANDING

110
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:22,678
UP TO DONALD TRUMP.

111
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:24,380
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

112
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,948
>>  WHEN I WORKED WITH PRESIDENT

113
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:27,350
OBAMA, AND I DID ON OCCASION, I

114
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,250
WAS A HERO.

115
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,953
NOW WHEN I WORK WITH TRUMP, I'M

116
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:31,320
TWO-FACED.

117
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,922
I KNOW HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED.

118
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:34,457
IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME WORKING

119
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:36,158
WITH TRUMP TO MAKE THE WORLD A

120
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:43,833
BETTER PLACE, I DON'T GIVE A

121
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,467
[BLEEP].

122
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,735
>>THEY'RE TRYING EVERYTHING BUT

123
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:46,936
NONE OF IT IS STICKING.

124
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:48,971
I'M TELLING YOU, I THINK THEY'RE

125
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:51,273
OUT OF POLITICAL AMMO HERE.

126
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:52,641
CLOSE IT OUT FOR US.

127
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:54,643
>>  I THINK THERE ARE TWO

128
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:55,044
THINGS.

129
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,980
I THINK FIRST PEOPLE -- THE

130
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,183
DEMOCRATS BET ON IMPEACHMENT.

131
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:03,252
THEY BET ON RUSSIAGATE.

132
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:04,220
AND THAT'S FALLING APART AND

133
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,988
THEY HAVE NO B PLAN.

134
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:09,558
AND SECONDLY ON POLICY, IT'S SO

135
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:12,328
CLEAR WE'RE OPPOSED TO TRUMP'S

136
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:15,197
ECONOMY, TRUMP IS HORRIBLE, THAT

137
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:17,099
WHEN HE ACCOMPLISHES SOMETHING,

138
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,834
THEY CAN'T SHARE THE SPOTLIGHT.

139
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:21,971
THEY CAN'T SHARE THE CREDIT.

140
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:23,706
REPUBLICANS COULD SHARE

141
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,207
CLINTON'S CREDIT FOR HEALTHCARE

142
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:28,511
REFORM AND THE BALANCED BUDGET.

143
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:29,779
>>  THEY'RE FRESH OUT OF IDEAS.

144
00:05:29,779 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S SHOWING.
