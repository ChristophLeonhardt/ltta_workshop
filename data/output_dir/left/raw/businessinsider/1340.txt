00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
I have a strong bias for outsiders I

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,790
think the insiders are often much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,690
polished<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're talented pollens but a</font>

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,240
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what they do does feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me like</font>

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,820
rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic

6
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,899
do you see this election as anything

7
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,670
more than a contest to see will be who

8
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,789
be the next captain of the Titanic well

9
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:48,979
i hope i hope not I worry about the

10
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:52,210
decline I take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it very seriously and and</font>

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,710
one of the things i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think i would have</font>

12
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,589
liked to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a race between Trump and</font>

13
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:00,070
Sanders because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> both of them</font>

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,059
viscerally felt the decline and

15
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:05,059
viscerally we very much disagreed about

16
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:07,070
what caused it what to do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,030
that would have been a very different

18
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,340
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> debate what we have is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a debate</font>

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,350
between you know one candidate who says

20
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,880
everything's more or less fine or it's

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,549
as good as it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then another</font>

22
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:18,140
one who says you know that we're on the

23
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,000
Titanic it's about to sink and so I

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:00:00,000
prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> second one</font>
