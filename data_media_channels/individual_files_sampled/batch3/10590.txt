a former police officer in the US state of North Carolina has been charged with assaulting a black man accused of jaywalking the incident happened last August him was captured on the officers body cam a 33 year-old Johnny rush here was on his way home when two officers stopped him and accused him of crossing an empty street illegally officer Chris Hickman can later be seen punching and tasering rush you might find the following video disturbing well that clip there was leaked six months after the incident took place anti-police brutality activist michelle gross says the police department's refusal to act on the video until it's leaked is alarming the video was held by the police department all this time and all of this time they could have taken action against officer Hickman an officer Ruby Airy and they chose not to you know supervisors look at that footage right away or at least they're supposed to and clearly he had no fear of any kinds of accountability related to that conduct this must be standard operating procedure in that particular Police Department and frankly it is in many police departments these videos must always be made public we have no way to monitor police conduct and to understand how our police are operating if we can't watch those videos that they themselves collect on their own activities well in response the Asheville Police Department has condemned the officer's actions saying that they are contrary to the progress we have made in the last several years in improving community trust however the incident is just the latest in the series of police brutality cases that have been captured by body cams over the past three years good on your stomach down
