all right Mary says hey Ben you answered one of my questions last week about the first site you go to when you wake up my follow-up question is of those you follow on Twitter which sites do you trust the most um it's more which journalists I trust the most and I follow a wide variety because the way that I gain trust is not in particular people but in people from various sides of the aisle reporting on the same issue so the way that I tend to look for what I think is factual is I find somebody on the left and then I find so many on the right and then what they are saying that's in common is the fact and everything else is their opinion so if I'm reading a piece from the New York Times and then I see a counter from Andrew McCarthy at National Review then that gives me a good perspective on what are the two views on a particular set of facts and it allows me to draw out what exactly was the set what exactly was factual and what exactly was opinion driven
