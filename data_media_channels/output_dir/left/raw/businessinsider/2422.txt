1
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,960
you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case where we're</font>

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,549
actually really<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud of what what we</font>

3
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,110
did in this case which is basically

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,480
reinvented the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> from scratch</font>

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,919
essentially took the cash and the people

6
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:22,869
and the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically did a</font>

7
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:24,490
restart as a public company<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,109
basically a whole new company called off

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,449
swear within the context of the previous

10
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:30,519
company and then ultimately sold it for

11
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,198
<font color="#E5E5E5">two billion dollars i mean tremendously</font>

12
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,510
successful over a period of years going

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,890
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that moment though there are</font>

14
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,000
lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies that just fail</font>

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,980
completely all of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> competitors are as</font>

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,719
loud cloud all of our competitors is

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,040
likely what bankrupt head except for us

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so did you stop the burn earlier no</font>

19
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,480
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crash earlier what was we have</font>

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,320
to give we we sold with a magic deal we

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,370
pulled out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> magic deal which was we</font>

22
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,870
sold our managed services business dds

23
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,460
now which actually turned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">great fit for edius because of what was</font>

25
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening on their own business and they</font>

26
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,629
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a big and successful company</font>

27
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:02,590
at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage and have the wherewithal</font>

28
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,910
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically make an</font>

29
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,170
investment like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at a time when a</font>

30
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,270
lot of other people couldn't but we

31
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,440
pulled off a deal with EDS where we

32
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,360
basically sold EDS our services business

33
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,160
and all the associated assets and the

34
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,840
burn rate and everything but also all of

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">our revenue all of our customers and</font>

36
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,490
actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of our people went over</font>

37
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,050
and sort of that deal safe that deal

38
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,990
save the company EDS did that in part

39
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,160
because they wanted that business but

40
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">also in part because they wanted us to</font>

41
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:26,560
actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps work because they</font>

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,849
wanted to become a major customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of I</font>

43
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:28,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">swear because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they wanted it for their</font>

44
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:30,459
own business and so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a case</font>

45
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:31,660
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right deal at the right time</font>

46
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,550
essentially saved the company so that

47
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">put us in a position where we could</font>

48
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:36,280
restart but then we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually</font>

49
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,819
build basically a whole nother<font color="#CCCCCC"> startup</font>

50
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:41,739
and you know we we enjoyed that process

51
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:43,750
like you know it's be less fun more fun

52
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,130
and not have to do it under the gun it

53
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,209
seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me because there I've seen</font>

54
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,649
other companies go through that that

55
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,810
there's core just ability to be flexible

56
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,420
and change if things are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going well</font>

57
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,209
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very core to success see a</font>

58
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:56,590
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what happens in the valley anyway</font>

59
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,479
if you look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> history of the major</font>

60
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology franchise's most of them</font>

61
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,690
started off doing something very

62
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">different than what they ultimately were</font>

63
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,450
successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Intel started out</font>

64
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,129
doing memory chips ended up doing CPUs

65
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,780
Microsoft started out doing programming

66
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,250
tools ended up doing operating systems

67
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple started out doing the Apple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

68
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,430
ended up becoming most successful for

69
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,900
the mac which had no bearing on the

70
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple no relationship available to</font>

71
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,930
Silicon Graphics started my part

72
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,730
Jim's company start out making graphics

73
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,469
cards for mainframes ended up making

74
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:25,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">super computers somebody's the other day</font>

75
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,319
said that trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

76
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,269
going to happen how a tech company tech

77
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:31,859
startup is going to be successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

78
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,269
little bit like looking at a sonogram

79
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:34,560
and then trying to predict the baby's

80
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,019
hair color it's like the it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

81
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,780
incredibly hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell and so the idea</font>

82
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,639
of really matters and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the products</font>

83
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">really matter and that all matters but</font>

84
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little about the adventure</font>

85
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:46,409
that you're undertaking at the time when

86
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're starting a new tech company that</font>

87
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,709
you in our view you have to assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

88
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:50,939
things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to change and you have</font>

89
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:52,409
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to change as you get the data</font>

90
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,120
and so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really goes back to that leap</font>

91
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,590
of faith and just maintaining

92
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,120
flexibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trying to plan</font>

93
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,849
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> for years ahead you have to</font>

94
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,459
have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> healthy awareness of the fog</font>

95
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">of war is basically the term that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font>

96
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:05,519
is basically like you have to have a

97
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,659
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> healthy awareness for what you</font>

98
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,459
don't know and it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of a</font>

99
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,099
paradox because the tech industry you

100
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,169
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move quickly you can't you can't</font>

101
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:14,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">move slow you have to move fast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

102
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,530
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very decisive but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same</font>

103
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,939
time you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be super flexible and</font>

104
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:19,500
able and willing to reverse yourself and

105
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,659
you get new information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's a</font>

106
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,129
whole class of decisions you want to

107
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,049
either you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> either be able to</font>

108
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:26,940
reverse your cell phone or postpone

109
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,769
making for as long as possible but you

110
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:29,849
have to know which decisions to make

111
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,560
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and which ones to defer a delay</font>

112
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,019
and that's a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the the art</font>

113
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it is like a super uncertain process</font>

114
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,319
the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's almost</font>

115
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,909
impossible to disentangle the role of

116
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:40,769
luck right the amount of this that's

117
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,870
just sheer random chance I think we have

118
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">no idea like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much of this is just</font>

119
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,040
sheer luck like why I'm sitting here and

120
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,299
not somebody else and why I'm not

121
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,549
working you know an organic mildew well

122
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:51,569
I'm not working to grocery store today

123
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,759
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I'm sure</font>

124
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,870
a big part of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was luck I don't know</font>

125
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,699
exactly how much but<font color="#CCCCCC"> for sure you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

126
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:57,930
to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of humility around what</font>

127
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,220
you actually know because you probably

128
00:03:59,220 --> 00:00:00,000
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>
