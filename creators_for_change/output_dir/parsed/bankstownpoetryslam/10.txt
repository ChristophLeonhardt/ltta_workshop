it's my
I'm fresh out of the yeah I struggled
with the hi I like my syllables
accounted odd my likely to be
comprehensive new music confuses me from
college to kadhi be rash evidence Whaley
and little R and little john little pop
little Johnny screwed screwed
silver chain and brandy and that's just
not cool anymore way it's gotta be
everybody little googly just screaming
to be free that's right a tea drinking
of very dairy food right have a spell
satellite a better place that tighten up
right for that teachers who whatever
does gently accelerates at Green - bank
account
mindfully exercises the inviting right
hash tag style of Khmer Bank gently
moves pop plants into the sunlight
you notice how beautiful life and maybe
that's not cool to me
