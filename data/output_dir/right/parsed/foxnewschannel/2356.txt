KEVIN CORKE IS LIVE AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
WHAT IS THE REACTION AT THE
WHITE HOUSE OF THE MEETING?
>> BOTH ON AND OFF THE RECORD
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS TELL YOU
THEY ARE VERY PLEASED BUT ALSO
CLEARLY CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.
ESPECIALLY CAUTIOUS.
LET ME TAKE YOU BACK TO TWITTER.
YOU SHOWED A TWEET THE
PRESIDENT HAD.
HE HAS HAD SEVERAL TWEETS THIS
MORNING.
EVERY TIME I HAVE A SCRIPT TO
TURN IN HE HAS ANOTHER TWEET
AND I HAVE TO ADJUST THE SCRIPT.
LET ME SHARE THIS ONE.
THE PRESIDENT SAYING AFTER A
FURIOUS YEAR OF MISSILE
LAUNCHES AND NUCLEAR TESTING A
HISTORIC MEETING BETWEEN NORTH
KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA IS
PLACING PLACE.
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING BUT
ONLY TIME WILL TELL.
EMPHASIS ON CAUTION.
THE HISTORIC GATHERING COMING
AHEAD OF PROPOSED TALKS BETWEEN
THE U.S. AND NORTH KOREA SET TO
TAKE PLACE IN LATE MAY OR EARLY
JUNE.
>> LET'S TALK TOGETHER BY
UNITEING OUR MINDS, EFFORTS AND
WISDOM TOGETHER FOR THE FUTURE
WHERE A NEW ERA, NEW DREAMS AND
HOPES ARE WAITING.
>> WE TAKE YOU BACK TO TWITTER.
IT'S SARAH SANDERS, THE WHITE
HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SAID THIS.
THIS, OF COURSE, ON THE HEELS
OF YESTERDAY'S CONFIRMATION OF
THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE
POMPEO.
GREAT TO HAVE SECRETARY POMPEO
CONFIRMED.
HE WILL DO AN EXCELLENT JOB
LEAD EFFORTS TO DENUCLEARIZE
THE KOREAN PENINSULA.
HE HAS PREVIOUSLY MET WITH THE
LEADER FROM PYONGYANG.
POTUS THANKING CHINA'S
PRESIDENT XI SAYING WITHOUT HIM
EVEN GETTING TO THIS POINT
WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH TOUGHER
AND LONGER PROCESS.
RICK.
>> Rick: GOOD JOB CHANGING YOUR
SCRIPT ON THE FLY THERE, KEVIN.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE
GERMAN CHANCELLOR'S VISIT TO
THE WHITE HOUSE THIS MORNING?
>> THIS HAS BEEN A WEEK OF
DIPLOMACY AND DISCUSSIONS AND
CLEARLY WHEN ANGELA MERKEL
COMES IT IS NOT THE
CONVERSATION YOU MIGHT EXPECT
BUT TARIFFS AND TRADE AND
NUCLEAR DEAL AND A RANGE OF
SECURITY ISSUES IN THE U.S. AND
GERMANY AND OTHER ALLIES IN
EUROPE WOULD LIKE THE TRY TO
TACKLE AND UNLIKE THE
OVERWHELMINGLY WARM RECEPTION
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR
PRESIDENT MACRON WHERE THEY
SEEMED TO JUST BE BFFs, HE HAS
HAD A FROSTY RELATIONSHIP WITH
ANGELA MERKEL.
SHE HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE, A
WORKING RELATIONSHIP.
ONE WE WOULD EXPECT TO BE SORT
OF LIKE WHAT WE'LL SEE AGAIN
THIS WEEK WHEN THE TWO LEADERS
HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET.
KELLYANNE CONWAY WAS ASKED
ABOUT THE FROSTY RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THESE TWO LEADERS.
HERE IS WHAT SHE SAID EARLIER
TODAY.
>> I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
COMPARE, FRANCE AND GERMANY ARE
GREAT ALLIES.
THERE ARE ISSUES THAT AFFECT
ALL OF US AT THE SAME TIME.
I THINK EVERY LEADER IS
DIFFERENT AND EVERY
RELATIONSHIP IS DIFFERENT.
THE IMPORTANT PART IS THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
COUNTRIES AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY
THAT ANGELA MERKEL IS MAKING
ANOTHER TRIP HERE TO THE UNITED
STATES.
>> THIS IS A WORKING VISIT SO
YOU WON'T HAVE ALL THE POMP AND
