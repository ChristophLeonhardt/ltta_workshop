thanks to tonight's breaking news report in The Washington Post we now know to a reasonable certainty why the president's lawyers leaked the list that they wrote of questions that Robert Muller and his investigators want to ask the President of the United States the Trump legal team which was in sole custody of that list leaked the list of the special prosecutors questions so that the president could attack the special prosecutor of course the Washington Post reports tonight that the president and several advisers now plan to point to the list as evidence that Muller has strayed beyond his mandate and is overreaching it now seems clear that the list of questions was written by the president's lawyers so that they could leak the list I mean surely they wrote the list for their own internal purposes and to show it to the president but also so they could leakin Robert ballers team did not put the questions in writing for the president's lawyers they simply told the president's chief criminal defense lawyer John Dowd what the questions would be and John Dowd then had those questions put in written form and tonight the Washington Post tells us that it was Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow who compiled a list of 49 questions that the team believed the president would be asked it was Jay Sekulow list that was handed to the New York Times and the New York Times says they got the list from quote a person outside mr. Trump's legal team and that makes John Dowd suspect number one in this leak because he is now outside mr. Trump's legal team in fact John Dowd quit the Trump legal team within a week and a half of getting those questions from the special prosecutor the special prosecutor's office could not possibly have leaked the document because they don't have the written list of questions that was created by John Dowd and Jay Sekulow John Dowd has denied today that he leaked those questions but John dabbe can now fairly be described by the New York Times or anyone else as a person outside of trumps legal team John Dowd is also the star of a dramatic scene delivered as the lead of Washington Post report tonight complete with the terrible dialogue of a terrible Hollywood screenwriter that John Dowd has told NBC News he thinks is an accurate representation of the scene and that means of course it is a scene that makes John Dowd a hero at least for Trump supporting readers in a tense meeting in early March with the special council president Trump's lawyers insisted that he had no obligation to talk with federal investigators probing Russia's interference in 2016 presidential campaigns but special counsel Robert a smaller the third responded that he had another option if Trump declined he could issue a subpoena for the president to appear before a grand jury according to four people familiar with the encounter Muller is warning the first time he is known to have mentioned a possible subpoena to Trump's legal team spurred a sharp retort from John Dowd then the president's lead lawyer this isn't some game dad said according to two people with knowledge of his comments you are screwing with the work of the President of the United States John Dobbs line is something you could come up with only if you know absolutely nothing about the law and John Dodds work for the president has been as unimpressive as any lawyers work for any president has ever been he was actually overheard violating attorney-client privilege and a Washington restaurant by reporter Ken Vogel who took notes and reported on the conversation that's never happened before that's John Dodds unique contribution to defending a president john dad's public unprofessionalism as a lawyer makes it conceivable certainly to me that he could have said something so childish and so silly to robert muller you're screwing with the work of the President of the United States everyone knows and by everyone I include high school students who've done a minimal amount of reading about presidents in trouble everyone knows that that is not a legal argument for stopping legal process against the President of the United States for investigations of violations of criminal or civil law rich Nixon was investigated by congressional committees and a special prosecutor during wartime Richard Nixon was managing and losing the Vietnam War every day that he was investigated and he couldn't stop the investigations by saying you are screwing with the work of the President of the United States Bill Clinton was sued while he was president of the United States and had to submit to all of the legal processes of that lawsuit while he was also being investigated by a special prosecutor for violations of criminal law including violations of law related to the lawsuit and Bill Clinton was of course impeached by the house representatives and he never got to say you are screwing with the work of the President of the United States there is absolutely no description or adjective offered in that scene in The Washington Post about how Robert Muller conducted himself in that room at that moment and that please pay attention to this that is always the journalistic tell about which side this story is coming from no one in the Mahler investigation leaked any of this and that could not be more clear if you know how to read these reports Robert Muller is nothing but a backboard off of which John Dowd gets to dramatically bounce his childish and legally empty line that I for one don't believe he ever said to Robert Muller because I'm giving John Dodd credit for being at least at least smart enough not to humiliate himself with that kind of legal shallowness and utter childishness in the face of serious and accomplished legal practitioners like Robert Muller and his team Rudy Giuliani is quoted in tonight's Washington Post report and so we know that Rudy Giuliani did talk to the reporters which means he might be also one of the sources of that fake traumatic John Dodd scene usually when people like Giuliani talked to reporters there are things they're willing to say on the record with their names attached and quotation marks and then there are other things that they say that appear the very same article with attributions like according to two people with knowledge of the Elm his comments what Rudy Giuliani did say on the record to the Washington Post completely and humiliatingly contradicts Rudy Giuliani and tonight's Washington Post report Giuliani says this about the possibility of the president agreeing to an interview with the special prosecutor quote I still have a totally open mind on what the right strategy is which will develop in the next few weeks the next few weeks according to Giuliani when he entered this case it was supposed to be over this week right now in Giuliani's first public comments in his new role as the lead Trump criminal defense strategist and leading public spokesperson for the Trump defense team and no doubt one of the league-leading secretly curzon the Trump team Rudy Giuliani said 12 days ago I don't think it's gonna take more than a week or two to get a resolution they're almost there so anyone seriously following this case and Rudy Giuliani's career was duly warned on the first day of his involvement in this case do not do not believe a word that Rudy Giuliani says a week or two and here we are at the end of a week or two and Rudy Giuliani is telling the Washington Post tonight that the legal team will now begin developing a strategy for Howard who approached the possibility of the president being interviewed by the special prosecutor and Rudy Giuliani says the strategy will be developed in the next few weeks first it was all going to be over in a week or two now they'll have a strategy about what to do next in a few weeks the president has never needed Rudy Giuliani to advise him on his strategy because the president's strategy has been consistent from the start to lie and to lie about the investigators and the investigation today the president tweeted his reaction to his own lawyers written versions of the questions the special prosecutor want to ask him these are the questions the president has known about for well over a month now and today the president tweeted so disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian witch-hunt were leaked to the media no questions on collusion oh I see you have a made-up phony crime collusion that never existed an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information nice exclamation point and it would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened witch-hunt hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube
