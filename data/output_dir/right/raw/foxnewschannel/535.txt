1
00:00:02,363 --> 00:00:04,498
GO AHEAD.

2
00:00:04,498 --> 00:00:05,366
>> Reporter: THANK YOU VERY

3
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:06,100
MUCH.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,602
IF YOU DON'T MIND, AFTER I AM

5
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:11,672
FINISHED, IF ONE OF OUR FEMALE

6
00:00:11,672 --> 00:00:13,207
COLLEAGUES TO GO AFTER ME, THAT

7
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:14,875
WOULD BE GREAT.

8
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,911
MR. PRESIDENT, JUST A FOLLOW-UP

9
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:17,511
ON THESE ALLEGATIONS --

10
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:19,146
>> President Trump: WHAT DOES

11
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:20,281
HE MEAN BY THAT?

12
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,749
EXPLAIN.

13
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:23,984
>> Reporter: FEMALE REPORTER.

14
00:00:23,984 --> 00:00:25,419
>> President Trump: WHAT DOES

15
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:26,120
IT MEAN?

16
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,621
>> Reporter: THAT A FEMALE

17
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:29,023
REPORTER WOULD ASK YOU ABOUT

18
00:00:29,023 --> 00:00:29,423
THIS ISSUE.

19
00:00:29,423 --> 00:00:30,157
>> President Trump: I WOULDN'T

20
00:00:30,157 --> 00:00:31,692
MIND THAT AT ALL.

21
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:32,893
IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE

22
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:33,894
TO ME.

23
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:34,495
GO AHEAD.

24
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:35,095
>> Reporter: IF I COULD

25
00:00:35,095 --> 00:00:37,898
FOLLOW-UP AND ON JOHN'S

26
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:39,233
QUESTION, WHY IS IT THAT YOU

27
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:42,469
ALWAYS SEEM TO SIDE WITH THE

28
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:43,871
ACCUSED AND NOT THE ACCUSER.

29
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:45,906
YOU HAVE THREE WOMEN HERE WHO

30
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:46,807
ARE ALL MAKING ALLEGATIONS, WHO

31
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:49,944
ARE ALL ASKING THAT THEIR

32
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:50,477
STORIES BE HEARD.

33
00:00:50,477 --> 00:00:52,513
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CASE OF

34
00:00:52,513 --> 00:00:53,280
ROY MOORE.

35
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,216
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CASE OF ONE

36
00:00:55,216 --> 00:00:57,918
OF YOUR STAFFERS, YOU SEEM TO,

37
00:00:57,918 --> 00:00:59,320
TIME AND AGAIN, SIDE WITH THE

38
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,055
ACCUSED ARE NOT THE ACCUSER.

39
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:02,790
IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE MANY

40
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,525
ALLEGATIONS THAT YOU HAVE HAD

41
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:06,126
MADE AGAINST YOU?

42
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:07,328
>> President Trump: FIRST OF

43
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,896
ALL, I WASN'T HAPPY WITH

44
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:09,496
ROY MOORE.

45
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:12,199
LET'S GET THAT STRAIGHT.

46
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:13,734
ROY MOORE WAS A REPUBLICAN

47
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:15,102
CANDIDATE, AND I WOULD HAVE

48
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:17,905
RATHER HAD A REPUBLICAN

49
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:19,073
CANDIDATE.

50
00:01:19,073 --> 00:01:20,708
I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH LUTHER

51
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,443
STRANGE, WHO IS A TERRIFIC MAN

52
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:22,876
FROM ALABAMA.

53
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:26,247
LUTHER STRANGE HAD A LOT OF

54
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:26,880
THINGS GOING AGAINST HIM.

55
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,551
AS FAR AS WOMEN, WHETHER IT'S A

56
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:33,287
MAN OR A WOMAN, THESE ARE, YOU

57
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:34,488
KNOW, IT CAN HAPPEN THE OTHER

58
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:34,755
WAY.

59
00:01:34,755 --> 00:01:36,323
ALLEGATIONS CAN HAPPEN THE OTHER

60
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:36,690
WAY ALSO.

61
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,925
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.

62
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:40,227
WHETHER IT WAS A MAN OR WOMAN,

63
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:42,263
30 YEARS AGO, 36 YEARS AGO, IN

64
00:01:42,263 --> 00:01:43,931
FACT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW

65
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:45,165
MANY YEARS AGO BECAUSE NOBODY

66
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:46,967
KNOWS WHAT THE TIME IS.

67
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:47,534
THAT'S A LONG TIME.

68
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:49,903
I COULD PICK AS AN EXAMPLE,

69
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:52,206
HOPEFULLY I WON'T HAVE TO DO IT

70
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:53,073
AS A REPLACEMENT BECAUSE

71
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:54,375
HOPEFULLY THIS IS GOING TO GO

72
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,409
VERY WELL ON THURSDAY AND IT'S

73
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,077
GOING TO GO VERY WELL ON MONDAY

74
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:58,412
OR SATURDAY OR SUNDAY OR

75
00:01:58,412 --> 00:01:59,780
WHENEVER THEY VOTE.

76
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:19,833
BUT I COULD PICK A WOMAN, AND

77
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:20,567
SHE COULD HAVE CHARGES MADE FROM

78
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:21,101
MANY YEARS AGO ALSO.

79
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:21,702
AND I WOULD LOOK AT THE

80
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:22,369
CHARACTER -- WHAT I HAVE TO

81
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:22,670
DO --

82
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,370
>> Reporter: RELUCTANT TO COME

83
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,704
FORWARD.

84
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:24,438
YOU'VE RAISED DOUBTS ABOUT THESE

85
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:24,805
ACCUSERS.

86
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:25,472
>> President Trump: I DON'T

87
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:26,173
THINK PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT TO

88
00:02:26,173 --> 00:02:26,607
COME FORWARD.

89
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:27,341
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE

90
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:27,708
TO SPEAK.

91
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,375
THEY HAVE A MAJOR CHANCE TO

92
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,110
SPEAK, AND IT WILL BE TOMORROW,

93
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,078
I ASSUME.

94
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:33,547
WE HAVE DELAYED THIS, MEANING

95
00:02:33,547 --> 00:02:36,317
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS, NOT ME.

96
00:02:36,317 --> 00:02:38,118
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE

97
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:40,087
DELAYED THIS FOR WEEKS NOW.

98
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:43,090
THEY ARE GIVING THE WOMEN A

99
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,491
MAJOR CHANCE TO SPEAK.

100
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:45,492
IT'S POSSIBLE I WILL HEAR THAT

101
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:48,696
AND I WILL SAY HEY, I AM

102
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:49,196
CHANGING MY MIND.

103
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:50,331
THAT IS POSSIBLE.

104
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:54,101
WE WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO

105
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:54,401
SPEAK.

106
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:54,968
AND THEY ARE GIVEN --

107
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:55,769
>> Reporter: TO THINK ALL

108
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:57,137
THREE SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE?

109
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:58,005
>> President Trump: WHOEVER IS

110
00:02:58,005 --> 00:02:59,106
GIVEN A CHANCE.

111
00:02:59,106 --> 00:03:00,607
WE HAVE DELETED A LONG TIME.

112
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:02,176
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIG

113
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:03,243
SHOT AT SPEAKING AND MAKING

114
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:03,811
THEIR CASE.

115
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:05,379
YOU KNOW WHAT, I COULD BE

116
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:09,483
PERSUADED ALSO.

117
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:11,385
YES, PLEASE, GO AHEAD.

118
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:14,288
YES, GO AHEAD PLEASE.

119
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:16,323
>> Reporter: THANK YOU,

120
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:16,757
MR. PRESIDENT.

121
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:17,691
A COUPLE QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW UP

122
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:18,625
ON SOME ANSWERS I DIDN'T QUITE

123
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,494
HEAR FROM YOU, IF YOU WOULD

124
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:21,528
ALLOW ME A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

125
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,497
FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU THINK THESE

126
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:26,934
WOMEN, ALL THREE OF THEM, ARE

127
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:27,234
LIARS?

128
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:28,702
>> President Trump: HAVE THEY

129
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:29,103
BEEN WATCH?

130
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:31,105
>> Reporter: HAVE THEY BEEN

131
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:31,405
LIARS?

132
00:03:31,405 --> 00:03:32,106
>> President Trump: I CAN'T

133
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:33,107
TELL YOU.

134
00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:34,708
I HAVE TO LISTEN TOMORROW.

135
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,243
I CAN TELL YOU HER LAWYER IS A

136
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:36,944
LOW LIFE.

137
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:38,445
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT

138
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:39,646
THEY ARE LIARS UNTIL I HEAR

139
00:03:39,646 --> 00:03:39,947
THEM.

140
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:42,149
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY

141
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:43,717
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VERY BUSY

142
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:45,319
WITH JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, CHINA

143
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,187
AND SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES, AS

144
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:47,921
YOU KNOW.

145
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:48,956
AND I CHAIRED THE SECURITY

146
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:49,523
COUNCIL.

147
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:51,425
SO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TODAY'S

148
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:53,827
PERSON THAT CAME FORWARD.

149
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:55,229
I DO KNOW ABOUT THE LAWYER.

150
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:57,431
YOU DON'T GET MUCH WORSE.

151
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,532
BAD REPUTATION.

152
00:03:58,532 --> 00:03:59,933
TAKE A LOOK AT HIS PAST.

153
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,835
AS FAR AS THE OTHER WOMEN ARE

154
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:03,103
CONCERNED, I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT

155
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:03,604
HAPPENS TOMORROW.

156
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:06,707
I'M GOING TO BE WATCHING.

157
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:09,676
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I'M GOING TO

158
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:10,944
SEE WHAT IS SAID.

159
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:12,713
IT'S POSSIBLE THEY WILL BE

160
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:13,514
CONVINCING.

161
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:17,517
NOW, WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID,

162
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:18,719
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN,

163
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:21,088
FOR MANY YEARS, ONE OF THE MOST

164
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:22,489
RESPECTED PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON.

165
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:24,425
HE'S BEEN ON, I GUESS YOU'D CALL

166
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:27,394
IT THE SECOND HIGHEST COURT.

167
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:29,897
EVERY SINGLE PERSON KNOWS HIM.

168
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:33,100
A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW HIM WELL.

169
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,435
AND THOSE PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE

170
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:36,136
WHAT'S GOING ON.

171
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:37,171
I CAN ALWAYS BE CONVINCED.

172
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:38,372
I HAVE TO HEAR IT.

173
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:39,506
>> Reporter: IT SOUNDS LIKE

174
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:40,607
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THERE IS

175
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:43,444
A SCENARIO UNDER WHICH YOU WOULD

176
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:44,511
WITHDRAW BRETT KAVANAUGH'S

177
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:44,912
NOMINATION.

178
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:47,514
IS THAT CORRECT >> President

179
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:49,116
Trump: IF I THOUGHT HE WAS

180
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,784
GUILTY OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

181
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:51,118
SURE.

182
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:52,019
>> Reporter: AND YOU WILL WAIT

183
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:54,321
UNTIL TOMORROW TO MAKE UP YOUR

184
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:54,688
MIND.

185
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:55,389
>> President Trump: I WILL

186
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:55,689
WATCH.

187
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:56,924
I HOPE I CAN SEE.

188
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:58,492
I WILL BE MEETING WITH A LOT OF

189
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:00,227
COUNTRIES TOMORROW BUT I AM

190
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:01,028
HOPING TO WASH.

191
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:09,970
I'M RELYING ON VERY FAIR AND

192
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,671
TALENTED REPUBLICAN SENATORS.

193
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:11,405
IF WE BROUGHT GEORGE WASHINGTON

194
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:12,005
HERE AND WE SAID WE HAVE

195
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:13,307
GEORGE WASHINGTON, THE DEMOCRATS

196
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:15,275
WOULD VOTE AGAINST HIM, JUST SO

197
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:15,742
YOU UNDERSTAND.

198
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:18,111
HE MAY HAVE HAD A BAD PASS.

199
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:18,479
WHO KNOWS?

200
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,915
HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME I THINK

201
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:22,483
ACCUSATIONS MADE.

202
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:25,719
DIDN'T HE HAVE A COUPLE THINGS

203
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:26,720
IN HIS PAST?

204
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,721
GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD BE VOTED

205
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,723
AGAINST 100% BY SCHUMER AND THE

206
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:30,724
CON ARTIST.

207
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:32,125
100%.

208
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,294
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER FROM

209
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:34,962
THIS.

210
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:37,231
WHEN JOHN ASKED ABOUT THE FBI,

211
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,533
IF THE FBI DID THE MOST THOROUGH

212
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:40,434
INVESTIGATION IN THE HISTORY OF

213
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:43,504
THE FBI THEY FOUND IT TO BE 100%

214
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:45,706
PERFECT, HE WOULD LOSE EVERY

215
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:46,340
SINGLE VOTE.

216
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,307
IF THE REPUBLICANS WIN BACK

217
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:48,308
TOMORROW, I THINK YOU'RE GOING

218
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:49,910
TO GET SOME QUOTES FROM THE

219
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,277
DEMOCRATS.

220
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:51,111
YOU KNOW WHY?

221
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:52,913
WE ALL KNOW WHY.

222
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:53,714
IT'S CALLED POLITICS.

223
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:54,781
THEN YOU'LL PROBABLY GET SOME

224
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:55,082
VOTES.

225
00:05:55,082 --> 00:05:57,117
ONE MORE QUESTION.

226
00:05:57,117 --> 00:05:58,652
SHE SAYS -- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK

227
00:05:58,652 --> 00:05:59,553
THREE QUESTIONS.

228
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:00,954
NOT REALLY FAIR TO EVERYONE

229
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:01,288
ELSE.

230
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:04,525
SHOULD I LET HER ASK ANOTHER

231
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:05,359
QUESTION?

232
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,126
GO AHEAD.

233
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:06,393
SEE?

234
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:10,764
>> Reporter: FOLLOWING UP,

235
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:15,102
THAT YOU HAD GIVEN THE BENEFIT

236
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:16,937
OF THE DOUBT TO ALL MEN.

237
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:18,939
HAS THERE EVER BEEN AN INSTANCE

238
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:21,074
WHEN YOU'VE GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF

239
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:21,942
THE DOUBT --

240
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:22,910
>> President Trump: I'VE KNOWN

241
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,144
THEM FOR A LONG TIME, A LOT OF

242
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:25,245
THESE PEOPLE.

243
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:27,915
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

244
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:28,815
SOME I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED

245
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:29,550
WITH.

246
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,284
I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH

247
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:32,953
SOME OTHERS, THERE ARE CHARGES

248
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:34,755
THAT ARE PRETTY WEAK, BUT I'VE

249
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:35,556
KNOWN PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME.

250
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:36,757
I NEVER SAW THEM DO ANYTHING

251
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:37,357
WRONG.

252
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:39,159
I NEVER SAW THEM DO ANYTHING

253
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,459
WRONG.

254
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:40,661
THERE ARE SOME THAT PROBABLY I

255
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:40,961
AGREE.

256
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:43,330
I CAN TELL YOU I AGREE THERE ARE

257
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,365
SOME THAT I'VE BEEN WATCHING FOR

258
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:46,567
A LONG TIME.

259
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,569
IN A COUPLE CASES, THEY WORKED

260
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:48,969
REPUBLICANS.

261
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:50,537
IN A LOT OF CASES THEY WERE NOT.

262
00:06:50,537 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WERE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE
