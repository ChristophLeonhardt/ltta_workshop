ROB: ALL RIGHT, ALL EYES REMAIN ON PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO NOW HEADS TO BRUSSELS LATER TODAY WHERE HE WILL COME FACE TO FACE WITH NATO LEADERS AFTER PUTTING THEM ON NOTICE. I WILL SEE NATO AND I'M GOING TELL NATO, YOU HAVE TO START PAYING BILLS. THE UNITED STATES IS NOT GOING TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. CARLEY: SO IS THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW, JOINING US UK FORMER LEADER NIGEL FARAGE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US THIS MORNING FROM SUNNY BERMUDA TO SAY THE LEAST. ROB: NICE. GET THEM TO COUGH UP MORE MONEY ON DEFENSE SPENDING, WHY DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT TO BE TOUGH ON THE ISSUE? THE PRESIDENT IS NOT BEING TOUGH ON THE ISSUE, THE NATO YOU HAVE TO SPEND 2% OF YOUR GDP ON DEFENSE. THE FACT IS THERE ARE 29 MEMBERS OF MEMBERS AND ONLY SIX OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY PAYING THE MEMBERSHIP FEE, SO THE ARGUMENT IS, WHY SHOULD AMERICA PROTECT I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE ARGUMENT BUT IT'S AGAINST HAVE TO PAY 1ER. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS ARE VARIOUS EUROPEAN LEADERS SAYING TRUMP IS THREATENING THE SECURITY OF PEOPLE IN EUROPE, THE TRUTH IS IT'S THE AMBITIONS OF THE EUROPEAN PROJECT THAT'S DOING IT AND I BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE VERY FIRM, INDEED. ROB: IT'S CRAZY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS BECAUSE YOU SEE THE UNITED STATES AT ABOUT 3 AND A HALF PERCENT, YOU GUYS HIT THE MARKET AT 2.12, WE BOTH HAVE BIG ECONOMY, WE ARE TALKING ON A BIG SCALE, 3 AND A HALF AND 2%, YOU HAVE SMALLER COUNTRIES WHO ARE GETTING THE DEAL OF A LIFETIME PAYING MAYBE 1% OF A VERY TINNY GDP TO JOIN A CLUB THAT GETS YOU THE BACKING OF MILITARIES THAT ARE WORTH TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS, I MEAN, WHAT A SWEET DEAL AND HOW COULD ANYBODY NOT CALL THEM OUT IS WHAT I'M SAYING? YEAH, NO, ABSOLUTELY. IT'S FREE LOADING, ISN'T IT? IT'S NOT JUST SMALL EUROPEAN BIGGEST COUNTRY IN EUROPE AND GERMANY IS ONLY PAYING 1.2% AND I THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND ANGELA MERKEL NEED TO HAVE A VERY FRANK DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT, OTHERWISE AS I SAY, EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE FREE ISN'T GOING TO RUFFLE ANY FEATHERS AT THE MEETING BECAUSE HE'S MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN WELL, LOOK, YOU KNOW, THE LIKE PUTIN OR NOT, THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT TRUMP STRATEGY IS YOU GO OUT THERE AND MEET RELATIONSHIP AND THAT MAKES THINGS BETTER. I THE THERE ARE MANY EUROPE, ABOUT PUTIN AND ABOUT RUSSIA. I THINK THE TRUTH OF IT IS IT'S THE UKRAINE, IT'S THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE UKRAINE AND CRIMEA THAT LED TO SUCH DETERIORATION OF CONDITIONS BUT DO I THINK THE ONE THING THAT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO DO IS HE NEEDS TO GET A PUBLIC ASSURANCE FROM PUTIN THAT RUSSIA WILL NOT MEDDLE IN AND THAT, I THINK, IS VERY IMPORTANT. ROB: ABSOLUTELY. EVERYBODY LOOKING FOR THAT. GOING TO YOUR COUNTRY, TURMOIL IN ENGLAND AS A COUPLE OF BREXITERS, BORIS JOHNSON QUIT YESTERDAY AND NOW EVERYBODY IS WORKS AND WHY THERESA MAY IS AT REMAINING SIDE. THAT WAS ADD CHOICE TO BECOME THE PRIME MINISTER, SHE PROMISED CABINET ON FRIDAY FRANKLY AMOUNTED TO A BETRAYAL OF MANY OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PROMISED EVEN IN HER OWN GENERAL MANIFESTO, SO THERE'S AN ISSUE BORIS JOHNSON AND DAVID DAVIS HAVE RESIGNED. I BELIEVE THEY ARE RIGHT TO DO SO AND I'M NOW AS THE VIEW THAT IF SHE STAYS PRIME MINISTER, WE WILL NOT GET THE BREXIT WE VOTED FOR AND NOT BE ABLE TO SIGN TRADE DEAL WITH AMERICA AND OTHER BIG COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND WHAT IT NOW NEEDS 48 CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT TO SIGN A LETTER OF NO CONFIDENCE AND THAT WOULD WHETHER SHE CAN CONTINUE OR NOT. MY GUESS, RIGHT NOW MY GUESS IS THAT THE TIDE IS NOW MOVING AGAINST HER AND I THINK, LITTLE CHANCE THAT SHE WILL SURVIVE MORE THAN A FEW WEEKS. ROB: THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD WANT, YOU WOULD LOVE HER OUT. THE BRITISH PUBLIC OVER BREXIT AND I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I THINK SHE'S THE WORST PRIME MINISTER WE'VE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFETIME. CARLEY: AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO HEADING TO LONDON VERY SOON. HE'S GOING TO BE HEADING THERE
