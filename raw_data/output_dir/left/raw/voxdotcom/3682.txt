1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,529
In late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina was moving its way across the Gulf coast.

2
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:08,580
It was classified as a Category 3 storm.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,250
Dangerous, but in a region with a long history
of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes, it wasn’t

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,179
expected to be the most intense.

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,180
Katrina was only one day away from the Louisiana
coast when the mayor of New Orleans issued

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,630
an evacuation order.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,750
Unfortunately, it was too late.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,410
The sea level had already risen in a phenomenon
called storm surge.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,330
Water rapidly rose up against the city's levees,
a series of walls designed to keep the area

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,330
from flooding.

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,260
Before Katrina made landfall, the levees broke.

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,240
A wall of water rushed into the city, trapping
thousands.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,120
What followed was one of the worst natural disasters in US history.

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,700
"We're expecting storm surge of 20 to 30 feet high"

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,900
"Flood waters are drenching city streets

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,900
"A levee broke during the height of the storm"

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,000
"There are bodies...uh... floating in the water there."

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,330
Storm surge was the main cause of death during
Hurricane Katrina.

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,960
In fact it can be the most dangerous part
of any hurricane.

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,780
It occurs when strong winds from an approaching
hurricane push water into the shore.

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,070
As the sea rises, a bulge of water sweeps
over coastal areas, causing destruction along

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,070
the way.

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,409
These are the normal astronomical tides at
Dauphin Island to the east of New Orleans.

24
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,049
When you compare them to the water levels
during hurricane Katrina — you can see the

25
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,050
dramatic rise.

26
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,659
That’s the storm surge.

27
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:24,420
What makes this rise dangerous is that it
starts to build up before the hurricane makes

28
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,460
landfall

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,170
So the coastal flooding from it can make evacuation
procedures and the impact of a hurricane much

30
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,170
worse.

31
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,630
In 2008, hurricane Ike caused a big storm
surge around Galveston, TX a day before landfall.

32
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,200
The rising water cut off evacuation routes
stranding hundreds.

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,290
More recently, the National Hurricane Center
issued dire warnings for the storm surge accompanying

34
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,580
Hurricane Irma, the most powerful storm to ever rage through the Atlantic Ocean.

35
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,119
A storm surge can also be unpredictable.

36
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,119
Rising sea levels caused by global warming
increase the risk of storm surge.

37
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,909
But there are many factors that can change
its size and strength.

38
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,080
For example, the largest one recorded before
Katrina was about 22 feet, during Hurricane

39
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,560
Camille in 1969.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,299
But Camille was a category 5 storm with 190
mph winds.

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,299
Katrina was only a category 3 with 130 mph
winds, but it had a storm surge of about 28

42
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:25,769
Katrina had slower winds than Camille but
it was twice as wide, which dramatically increased

43
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:31,400
the storm surge.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,430
These calculations help forecasters warn communities
at risk.

45
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,019
But they’re often not enough to prevent
damage on the ground.

46
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:40,680
This map shows the highest storm surge events
worldwide since 1880.

47
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,260
In the US, the eastern and southeastern coastlines
are among the most vulnerable areas for storm

48
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,790
surges in the world.

49
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,170
Along the east coast, hurricane Sandy got
its strength from a massive storm surge in

50
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,170
2012.

51
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,029
On the Gulf Coast side, places like Texas
and South Florida have seen multiple hurricanes

52
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:59,819
so they've built infrastructure to help defend
against excessive flooding.

53
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,599
Levees and seawalls are designed to stop or
redirect rising water away from cities.

54
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,529
But even those can be inadequate, as seen
during hurricanes Katrina and more recently,

55
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:09,529
Harvey.

56
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:14,150
What really concerns experts, though, are
places that don’t experience a lot of hurricanes

57
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,930
but are still vulnerable to storm surge.

58
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,349
This map shows that in the event of a big
hurricane, based on the characteristics of

59
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,560
the shoreline, the coasts of Northwest Florida
and Georgia would be at comparable risk to

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,150
the Gulf Coast.

61
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,450
These areas have shallow water, which means
sea level can rise faster and water can reach

62
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,870
further inland making the flooding worse.

63
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,670
But they’ve seen fewer hurricanes than the
Gulf Coast and they are likely to be less

64
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,670
prepared.

65
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,029
So when a major hurricane like Irma hits low-lying
areas like these, the storm surge can be the

66
00:03:40,029 --> 00:00:00,000
first and deadliest thing headed their way.
