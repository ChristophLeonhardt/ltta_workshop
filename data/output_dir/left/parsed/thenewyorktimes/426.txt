It's just amazing, like 
I can see everything,
like Central Park all the way down 
to the World Trade Center.
It's just me, my partner 
and the window, that's it.
Up there you don't hear nothing,
it's just when you go down, 
all the way down,
that you hear the commotion of the 
cars and horns, you know all that stuff.
The firefighters, ambulance 
and stuff like that.
But once you're up there 
you don't hear nothing.
People think I'm crazy but,
I prefer to be in there looking at 
people working in the office,
than me working in the office, because I 
don't stay there on the computer all day.
And it's not that scary, you know,
roller coasters are scarier than that.
