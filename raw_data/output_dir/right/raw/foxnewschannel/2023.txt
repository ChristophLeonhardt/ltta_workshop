1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,182
I HAVE NEVER ENGAGED IN

2
00:00:02,182 --> 00:00:08,855
NONCONSENSUAL SEX WHICH IS A

3
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:10,690
LINE IT WOULD NOT CROSS."

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,893
ALSO DEVELOPING TONIGHT, AND THE

5
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:16,296
WEALTHY ENCLAVE OF BELHAVEN AND

6
00:00:16,296 --> 00:00:17,797
GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT, A

7
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:18,932
15-YEAR-OLD GIRL'S BODY WAS

8
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:20,467
FOUND UNDER A PINE TREE.

9
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:22,402
SHE HAD BEEN HIT SO HARD WITH A

10
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:23,937
GOLF CLUB THAT IT BROKE THE CLUB

11
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:27,273
IN HALF.

12
00:00:27,273 --> 00:00:30,043
THE BLUNT END WAS USED TO STAB

13
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:30,543
HER IN THE NECK.

14
00:00:30,543 --> 00:00:33,113
EARLIER THAT NIGHT SHE HAD BEEN

15
00:00:33,113 --> 00:00:35,448
AT THE SCHEDULE HOUSE.

16
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:37,083
THE KENNEDYS WERE KNOWN FOR

17
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:37,650
HAVING A LITTLE ADULT

18
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,451
SUPERVISION AFTER THE PASSING OF

19
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:40,620
THEIR YOUNG MOTHER.

20
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,391
THEN IN THE GARAGE LIKE TYPICAL

21
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,059
TEENAGERS AND WHAT HAPPENED

22
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,927
NEXT, ONLY THOSE WHO WERE THERE

23
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:49,395
REALLY NO.

24
00:00:49,395 --> 00:00:52,499
WAS SHE KILLED BY THE TUTOR CAN

25
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:54,734
LITTLETON GMAC OR ONE OF THE

26
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:57,904
BOYS, MICHAEL OR TOMMY?

27
00:00:57,904 --> 00:00:59,038
MICHAEL SPENT TEN YEARS IN

28
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:01,808
PRISON BEFORE HIS GUILTY VERDICT

29
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:02,809
WAS OVERTURNED AND THEN

30
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:04,878
REINSTATED AND THEN TURNED OVER

31
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:06,045
AGAIN THIS PAST FRIDAY.

32
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:07,580
JOINING ME NOW WITH THE FAMILY'S

33
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,049
REACTION IS MARTHA'S BROTHER

34
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:10,450
JOHN MOXLEY.

35
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,952
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING

36
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:13,319
HERE.

37
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,688
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

38
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:16,422
YOU AND YOUR MOTHER HAVE STOOD

39
00:01:16,422 --> 00:01:18,258
UP FOR YOUR SISTER AND WHAT

40
00:01:18,258 --> 00:01:20,093
HAPPENED TO HER ALL THESE YEARS

41
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:20,894
AND SAT THROUGH ALL THESE

42
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:21,227
TRIALS.

43
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:22,929
WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN

44
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:26,466
THIS GOT OVERTURNED AGAIN ON

45
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:26,800
FRIDAY?

46
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,500
>> IT'S FRUSTRATING AT BEST,

47
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,736
BECAUSE AS YOU'VE SAID WE SAT

48
00:01:29,736 --> 00:01:30,470
THROUGH, I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU

49
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,272
HOW MANY TRIALS.

50
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:35,108
WE'VE BEEN IN FRONT OF THE

51
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:35,942
CONNECTICUT STATE SUPREME COURT

52
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,010
A FEW TIMES AND EVERY TIME THEY

53
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,913
HAVE RULED IN OUR FAVOR OR THEY

54
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:42,248
DIDN'T BUY INTO THE ARGUMENTS

55
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:44,217
AND I WAS AT THE TRIAL EVERY DAY

56
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:48,621
AND THIS IS THE WEAKEST ARGUMENT

57
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:49,355
AND THIS IS THE WEAKEST ARGUMEN

58
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:49,989
ARGUMENT, THE INEFFECTIVE

59
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:52,659
COUNSEL THAT THEY HAD.

60
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,063
THE MEMBERS OF THE COURT CHANGED

61
00:01:57,063 --> 00:01:58,832
THE JUDGE THAT WROTE THE

62
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:02,135
MAJORITY OPINION RETIRED, JUDGE

63
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:07,540
PALMER THAT WROTE THE DISSENT I

64
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,675
THINK WAITED.

65
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:10,342
IF THEY WERE ASKED TO

66
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:11,311
RECONSIDER.

67
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,713
THEY JUST MADE A DECISION WHY

68
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:14,480
THEY NEED TO RECONSIDER.

69
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,015
BUT THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE

70
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:17,050
COURT CHANGED EVERYTHING.

71
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,484
>> Martha: WHO DO BELIEVE

72
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:19,886
KILLED MARTHA?

73
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:20,286
>> MICHAEL.

74
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:21,321
I'M ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED OF IT.

75
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:22,889
I SAT THROUGH THE TRIAL EVERY

76
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:23,156
DAY.

77
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:24,691
I HEARD ALL THE EVIDENCE.

78
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:25,658
THE ONLY THING THAT I DON'T KNOW

79
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:28,528
THAT I SUSPECT IS THAT HIS

80
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:32,298
BROTHER TOMMY AND PERHAPS HIS

81
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:33,299
COUSIN JIMMY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

82
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:34,601
I DON'T THINK HIS YOUNGER

83
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:35,869
BROTHERS KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

84
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:37,270
I THINK THEY WERE INNOCENT.

85
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,905
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE STANDING BY

86
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:39,639
HIM TODAY BUT YOU NEVER SEE ANY

87
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,041
OF HIS OLDER SIBLINGS.

88
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,076
>> Martha: AS YOU LOOK BACK ON

89
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:45,845
THIS WHOLE THING AND YOU THINK

90
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:47,280
ABOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE

91
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,647
FAMILIES.

92
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:48,648
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A FAMILY THAT

93
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:51,451
HAS A REPUTATION FOR CIRCLING

94
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:52,418
THE WAGONS AND PROTECTING EACH

95
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:52,719
OTHER.

96
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,954
HOW MUCH OF THAT CAME INTO PLAY

97
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:55,722
HERE?

98
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:59,259
>> A LOT OF THE FAMILY WASN'T

99
00:02:59,259 --> 00:02:59,726
THERE.

100
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:01,761
THERE WERE SOME STAUNCH

101
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:08,835
SUPPORTERS.

102
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:09,502
THEIR BROTHER, THEIR COUSIN.

103
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:10,236
IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO STAND UP

104
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:10,904
FOR YOUR FAMILY, WHO ARE YOU

105
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:11,471
GOING TO STAND UP FOR?

106
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:12,205
BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF

107
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:12,572
PRACTICE.

108
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:13,239
>> Martha: YOU BELIEVE THAT

109
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:14,274
TOMMY MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED?

110
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:14,607
>> YES.

111
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:15,575
>> Martha: WHAT ARE YOU GOING

112
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:16,075
TO DO NOW?

113
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:17,176
WHAT IS YOUR NEXT STEP NOW THAT

114
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:21,581
THIS IS BEEN OVERTURNED?

115
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:25,718
>> AS I UNDERSTAND IT, NOW THAT

116
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:26,719
THE COURT HAS REVERSED THEIR

117
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,454
DECISION AND MADE A DECISION,

118
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:29,222
THE STATE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

119
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:33,860
LOOK AT THE DECISION AND SEE IF

120
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,295
THERE'S ROOM TO MANEUVER, AND I

121
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:36,195
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

122
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:39,499
I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY.

123
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:42,068
IT'S THE STATE'S TURN TO LOOK AT

124
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:42,936
THAT DECISION AND DECIDE WHETHER

125
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:46,372
OR NOT TO APPEAL OR NOT.

126
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:49,175
>> Martha: PUT THIS TO REST IN

127
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:50,877
MY >> IT WILL NEVER BE TO REST.

128
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:51,678
IT WILL NEVER BE.

129
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:53,179
IT'S JUST PART OF OUR LIFE AND

130
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:55,481
WE GO ON WITH IT ON A DAY-TO-DAY

131
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:55,782
BASIS.

132
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:57,884
WE TRY TO HAVE A POSITIVE

133
00:03:57,884 --> 00:03:58,217
OUTLOOK.

134
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:00,553
THERE'S NO HATE IN OUR HEARTS,

135
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:02,689
IT'S JUST TOO HEAVY OF A BURDEN

136
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:05,892
TO BEAR, BUT IT'S JUST THE LIFE

137
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:08,161
WE KNOW.

138
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:09,562
THE ROLLER COASTER OF ALL OF

139
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:12,131
THESE DECISIONS.

140
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:15,501
IT'S AMAZING THAT SINCE 2002 --

141
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:17,670
BEFORE 2002, ALL OF THE ONE-MAN

142
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,672
GRAND JURY, ALL OF THE

143
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:20,873
PRELIMINARY TRIALS, ALL OF THE

144
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:22,942
INVESTIGATION, ALL OF THE FALSE

145
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:25,044
LEADS, EVERYTHING LED BACK TO

146
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:25,511
MICHAEL.

147
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,313
AND THROUGH HIS OWN DEEDS IN HIS

148
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:29,549
OWN WORDS PUTS HIMSELF AT THE

149
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:32,685
PLACE AT THE TIME AND EXPLAINS

150
00:04:32,685 --> 00:00:00,000
WHY THEY WOULD BE PHYSICAL
