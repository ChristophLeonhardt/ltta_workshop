SCANDAL. I'VE GOT TO RUN. THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOD BLESS YOU. THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US. MEANWHILE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS EARLIER WROTE MAJOR NEWS ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SOME TO SUMMIT. TAKE A LISTEN. I CAN TELL YOU THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN RECEIVING DAILY BRIEFINGS ON NORTH KOREA FROM HIS NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM AND I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THE SCHEDULE FOR TENTATIVELY THAT FIRST MEETING WILL BE ON JUNE 12TH AT 9:00 A.M. SINGAPORE TIME AND TAKE PLACE AT JUNE 11TH, 9:00 P.M. EAST COAST TIME. NO MATTER WHAT YOU CALL IT, ITS MAXIMUM PRESSURE THAT SEALED THE POLICY IN NORTH KOREA? THE POLICY HAS NOT CHANGED. AS THE PRESIDENT STATED, WE HAVE SANCTIONS ON, VERY POWERFUL, AND WILL NOT TAKE THE SANCTIONS OFF UNLESS NORTH KOREA AGREES WITH US. Sean: HERE WITH THE REACTION IS WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS. GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU, ALWAYS, FOR BEING BACK WITH US. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS REALLY SIMPLE ABOUT NORTH KOREA. SO FAR, WE KNOW THAT ONE NUCLEAR TEST SITE IS SHUT DOWN. WE KNOW THAT HE ACROSS THE DMZ, RELEASE THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES. WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THE DENUCLEARIZATION. AND AS FAR AS I KNOW, THE UNITED STATES AND THE PRESIDENT HAVE NOT PAID A DIME FOR ANY OF THAT. TRUE? TRUE. LOOK, THE PRESIDENT HAS CONCEDED NOTHING. AND THE SANCTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ON-SITE WILL WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON PLACE. AS THE PRESIDENT SAID ON FRIDAY, THIS IS PART OF THE DISCUSSION, AND HE LOOKS FORWARD TO THIS MEETING. HE THINKS IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY GOOD AND PRODUCTIVE MEETING AND IT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS, BUT HE CERTAINLY THINGS THAT JUNE 12TH IS GOING TO BE A GOOD MEETING AND HE CERTAINLY IS LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING THAT HERE IN THE NEXT WEEK. Sean: I THINK THE PRESIDENT ALSO IS VERY SMART IN TRYING TO MANAGE EXPECTATIONS. NOTHING IS GOING TO BE SIGNED IT NEXT WEEK, THIS WILL GO AS FAST OR SLOW AS NORTH KOREA WANTS. THE SANCTIONS REMAIN IN PLACE. IF THERE WAS ANOTHER MISSILE FIRED, WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT WILL PROBABLY SEND OR STRIKE FORCES RIGHT BACK ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, IF NEED BE. IT SEEMS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PRESIDENT PULLED OUT FOR A PERIOD, HE MEANS WHAT HE SAYS. HE'S WILLING TO WALK AWAY AT ANY TIME. 100%. THE PRESIDENT IS EXTREMELY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS PROCESS. ULTIMATELY, HE WANTS TO SEE THE NEW REALIZATION OF THE PENINSULA. THAT IS THE TOP GOAL HERE, THAT'S WHAT HE'S FOCUSED WITH THE TALKS WAS UNDER ON. THIS MAY TAKE TIME. THIS MAY NOT TAKE TIME OVER THE COURSE OF ONE MEETING BUT SEVERAL MEETINGS. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THAT DIALOGUE. THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE A COMMITTED AND FIRM TO IT. HE HAS A GOOD FEELING OF HOW THIS FIRST MEETING WILL GO. Sean: I UNDERSTAND HOW THE MEDIA IS, SO THE PRESIDENT HAS KEPT ALL OF HIS PROMISES OF GETTING RID OF BURDENSOME REGULATION, BIGGEST TAX CUTS AND HISTORIES, MOVING THE COUNTRY TOWARDS ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. YOU CAN SEE THE PRESIDENT IS FIGHTING ON ALL ISSUES REGARDING THE BORDER AND THE WALL. I KNOW IT'S 500 DAYS IN. HE KEPT HIS WORD ON JERUSALEM, THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL, PULLING OUT OF THE RADIANT DEAL IF YOU'RE NOBODY REALLY EXPECTED, STARTED OUT AS LITTLE ROCKET MAN STARTED OUT AS LITTLE ROCKET MA, STARTED OUT AS LITTLE ROCKET MAT STARTED OUT AS LITTLE ROCKET MAI STARTED OUT AS LITTLE ROCKET MAS STARTED OUT AS LITTLE ROCKET MA. I WATCH YOU EVERY DAY AND I WATCHED TODAY, ALL THE FOCUS IS, YOU TOLD US IN 2017 THE PRESIDENT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COMMENTS OF DON JR., I'M THINKING THAT EVERY REPORT SHOWS THAT WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID, THAT THE FACT THAT THE MEETING WAS ALL ABOUT ALL THE EMAILS PROVING TO BE ABOUT TALKING ABOUT ADOPTION, THE FACT IS THAT AT THE END OF THE REPORT, THEY TOLD THE TRUTH. ISN'T THAT THE BIGGER PICTURE THAT IS MISSED TONIGHT? CERTAINLY THAT IS ONE OF THE BIG THINGS MISSED TONIGHT, BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST STORY BEING MISSED TONIGHT, AND I SAW TODAY IN THE ROOM, THEY ASKED ME 100 QUESTIONS ON THE FAKE WITCH HUNT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FIXATED ON THESE LAST 500 DAYS, BUT THEY FORGOT TO MENTION THAT DON'T LIKE ABOUT THINGS AMERICANS CARE ABOUT LIKE THE BOOMING ECONOMY. WE HAVE THE BEST ECONOMY WE'VE HAD SINCE WORLD WAR II. THEY HAVE REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THE STOCK MARKET IS GROWING. PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE JOBS. PEOPLE WHO NEED JOBS AND WANTS JOBS CAN GET THEM. I MEAN, THE FACT THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT, THAT WASN'T BROUGHT UP, THAT WAS TOTALLY IGNORED, THE FACT THAT ISIS IS ON THE RUN AND BEING DEFEATED DAY AFTER DAY AND WE ARE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION THAN EVER BEFORE WHEN IT COMES TO THAT BATTLE, THE FACT THE PRESIDENT HAS COMPLETELY REMADE THE JUDICIARY, THE FACT THAT WE ARE BECOMING AN ENERGY INDEPENDENT AND ENERGY DOMINANT COUNTRY UNDER THIS RESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, THEY IGNORE ALL THE SUCCESSES OF THIS PRESIDENT AND IT'S TO THEIR DETRIMENT. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT AND THAT IS WHY THE
