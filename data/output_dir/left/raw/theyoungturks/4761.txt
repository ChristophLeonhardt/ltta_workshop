1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,819
TUNNEL TRUMP GAVE A SPEECH IN
REGARD TO OUR POLICY WITH CUBA,

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:08,670
AND OF COURSE IN HIS EFFORT TO
ROLL BACK ANYTHING THAT OBAMA

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,019
DID, HE HAS DECIDED THAT, NO,
LIFTING THE EMBARGO ON CUBA

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,660
ISN'T A GOOD IDEA.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,830
HE GIVES INTERESTING REASONS AS
TO WHY HE THINKS THAT'S THE

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,930
CASE, LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,900
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY ON
CANCELING THE LAST

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:31,800
ADMINISTRATION'S COMPLETELY
ONE-SIDED DEAL WITH CUBA.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,200
OUR NEW POLICY BEGINS WITH
STRICTLY ENFORCING U.S. LAW.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
WE

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,130
WILL NOT LIFT SANCTIONS ON THE
CUBAN REGIME UNTIL ALL POLITICAL

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:51,790
PRINTERS ARE FREED, FREEDOMS OF
ASSEMBLY AND EXPRESSION ARE

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:01:03,040
RESPECTED, ALL POLITICAL PARTIES
ARE LEGALIZED, AND FREE AND

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,600
INTERNATIONALLY SUPERVISED
ELECTIONS ARE SCHEDULED.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
WE WILL

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,170
VERY STRONGLY RESTRICT AMERICAN
DOLLARS FLOWING TO THE MILITARY,

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,950
SECURITY, AND INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES THAT ARE THE CORE OF

18
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,829
THE CASTRO REGIME.

19
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:25,090
THEY WILL BE
RESTRICTED.

20
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,270
WE WILL ENFORCE THE

21
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,799
BAN ON TOURISM.

22
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:33,039
WE WILL ENFORCE
THE EMBARGO.

23
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,039
WE WILL TAKE

24
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:39,600
CONCRETE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT
INVESTMENTS FLOW DIRECTLY TO THE

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,179
PEOPLE, SO THEY CAN OPEN PRIVATE
BUSINESSES AND BEGIN TO BUILD

26
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:49,990
THEIR COUNTRY'S GREAT, GREAT
FUTURE, A COUNTRY OF GREAT

27
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,409
POTENTIAL.

28
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:57,520
IT'S FASCINATING, BECAUSE HE
THINKS WE CAN'T DO BUSINESS WITH

29
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
CUBA.

30
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,740
I MEAN, THEY DON'T RESPECT
THEIR PEOPLE.

31
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,740
THERE ARE ALL

32
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,999
THESE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND
VIOLATIONS, WE CAN'T HAVE ANY OF

33
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:04,999
IT.

34
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,210
NO, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT, IT'S ALL ABOUT

35
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,250
PANDERING TO CUBAN VOTERS IN
FLORIDA SPECIFICALLY, AND TO

36
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,190
GIVE YOU QUICK STATS ON THAT, IN
FLORIDA CUBANS WERE ABOUT TWICE

37
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,220
AS LIKELY AS NON-CUBAN LATINOS
TO VOTE FOR TRUMP, MORE THAN

38
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,180
HALF SUPPORTED HIM DURING THIS
LAST ELECTION.

39
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,180
HE'S PANDERING TO

40
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,310
THEM, IF HE REALLY CARED ABOUT
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES THEIR OTHER

41
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,700
COUNTRIES HE'S DEFINITELY OKAY
DOING BUSINESS WITH.

42
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
LIKE TEXAS.

43
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,989
RIGHT, THAT ARE MUCH WORSE
WHEN IT COMES TO HUMAN RIGHTS

44
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:35,299
ISSUES.

45
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:37,110
SAUDI ARABIA, FOR
INSTANCE, WHICH WE KEEP BRINGING

46
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,831
UP, IS TERRIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO
HUMAN RIGHTS, AND IF YOU WANT TO

47
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:44,700
FOCUS ON WHAT THEY'VE DONE ON AN
INTERNATIONAL SCALE, FOCUS ON

48
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,069
YEMEN.

49
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:48,379
SAUDI ARABIA HAS
COMMITTED NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS OF

50
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:53,829
INTERNATIONAL LAW SINCE
COALITION AIRSTRIKE BEGAN.

51
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:58,409
CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND
WOUNDED, AIRSTRIKES ARE THE

52
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:03,689
SINGLE LARGEST CAUSE OF CIVILIAN
CASUALTIES IN YEMEN.

53
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:04,689
AND IN

54
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:06,310
THEIR OWN COUNTRY, THE
BEHEADINGS.

55
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,439
BABY HAD PEOPLE FOR

56
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,469
NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES, FOR
INSTANCE.

57
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:10,469
BUT THAT'S NOT A HUMAN

58
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:14,030
RIGHTS ISSUE, HE'S NOT CONCERNED
ABOUT THAT, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE

59
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,609
PROFITS FROM BUSINESS EELS WITH
SAUDI ARABIA.

60
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:17,609
IT'S NOT ABOUT

61
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:18,609
HUMAN RIGHTS.

62
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,370
I'M NOT GOING TO
SIT HERE AND PRETEND CUBA IS

63
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,269
PERFECT, THEY DON'T HAVE A
DEMOCRACY OR ALLOW ELECTIONS,

64
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:31,079
THERE ARE PEOPLE SUFFERING UNDER
THE CASTRO START BACK BUT I ALSO

65
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,840
KNOW THAT THE EMBARGO DID NOT
WORK, AND IF YOU WANT ACTUAL

66
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,760
CHANGE IN CUBA YOU DON'T DO IT
BY SHUTTING THEM OUT AND

67
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,340
THINKING THAT'S GOING TO
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

68
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,459
OBVIOUSLY WE HAD THE EMBARGO
FOR DECADES AND IT MADE NO

69
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:43,459
DIFFERENCE.

70
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,280
THE EMBARGO JUST NEEDED TIME.

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,299
IF YOU JUST HAD A LITTLE
PATIENCE, THAT THING I

72
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:51,129
THINK WAS ABOUT TO KICK IN.

73
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:52,620
THE PANDERING IS UNBEARABLE.

74
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,310
I
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WORSE, THIS

75
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,209
PANDERING OR THE HOT SAUCE IN MY
PURSE PANDERING THAT HILLARY

76
00:03:58,209 --> 00:03:59,209
DID.

77
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,290
BUT THE PANDERING DRIVES ME
CRAZY REGARDLESS OF WHO DID IT.

78
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,670
I UNDERSTAND, YOU AND I WERE
ON THE SAME PAGE REGARDING

79
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,420
HILLARY -- BUT THE HOT SAUCE
PANDERING IS JUST STUPID.

80
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,420
THIS

81
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,450
IS AMERICAN POLICY, THIS ROLLS
BACK ACTUAL PROGRESS.

82
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,450
ALTHOUGH

83
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,459
SIGNIFICANTLY, BECAUSE IT'S
TRUMP, IT'S MOSTLY A LIE.

84
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,459
FIRST

85
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,630
OF ALL WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT
INVESTMENTS AND MAKE SURE THEY

86
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,630
GO TO THE PEOPLE?

87
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,130
THAT MEANS WE
WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW

88
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,530
INVESTMENTS, BECAUSE ALL THEY
HAVE TO DO IS SAY IT WILL GO TO

89
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,850
THE PEOPLE.

90
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,270
CRUISE LINES,
AIRLINES, NOT AFFECTED BY THIS,

91
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,490
BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY SET UP.

92
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,220
THEY AREN'T GOING TO MAKE THEM

93
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,320
-- IT WON'T -- BE
CUBAN-AMERICANS GETTING TO GO

94
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,200
BACK AND FORTH AND WE ALREADY
KNOW FROM THE CUBAN AMERICAN

95
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,000
NATIONAL FOUNDATION AND ONE
CUBAN-AMERICAN LAWMAKER, HE SAID

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,910
THE POLICY WON'T BE ANYTHING
NEW, IT'S PRETTY WEAK AND THERE

97
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,440
WILL BE MANY IN MIAMI WHO DON'T
THINK IT WENT FAR ENOUGH.

98
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
BUT HE

99
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,690
HAD TO START A SPEECH, I AM
ENDING THE OBAMA -- YOU DIDN'T,

100
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,350
YOU ENDED ABOUT 21% OF IT.

101
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,120
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO, BECAUSE

102
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,040
IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

103
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,170
AND I'M
SURE EVERYONE ELSE, ESPECIALLY

104
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,760
THE FEW PROFESSIONALS IN THE
STATE DEPARTMENT WHO HAVE ANY

105
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,580
POWER NOW, ARE LIKE, NO, THIS IS
A TERRIBLE IDEA.

106
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,580
AND THE OBAMA

107
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:25,030
POLICY WAS MARGINAL, AND
SIGNIFICANTLY HAVANA'S EMBASSY

108
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,000
IN WASHINGTON AND OURS IN
HAVANA, THEY STAYED.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,140
IF YOU WANT TO ROLL BACK THE
POLICY YOU SHUT DOWN THE EMCEES.

110
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,140
IT'S ALL PANDERING.

111
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:42,670
AND IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO GET US
TO STOP TALKING ABOUT THE

112
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,840
OTHER STUFF.

113
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,450
HE'S TRYING TO APPEAL TO A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THE CUBAN

114
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,510
POPULATION IN FLORIDA THAT'S
VERY CONSERVATIVE, AND THAT HOLD

115
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,360
A GRUDGE FROM THE CASTROS.

116
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,950
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

117
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,880
DONALD TRUMP CAN TALK ALL HE
WANTS -- HILTON HOTELS, CASINO

118
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,610
GAMBLING COMPANIES, CRUISE
SHIPS, AIRLINES, THEY ARE

119
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,550
LOOKING AT HIM LIKE, WOULD YOU
SHUT UP?

120
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,480
WE ARE DIVIDING UP CUBA

121
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,740
TO SEE HOW WE ARE GOING TO MAKE
THE MONEY, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO

122
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,150
GET IN THE WAY OF THIS.

123
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,610
DONALD
TRUMP CARES ABOUT PRISONERS

124
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,840
BECAUSE HE COULD BECOME ONE ON
ANY DAY.

125
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,210
HE'S LIKE, WE'VE GOT TO

126
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,010
MAKE SURE WE ARE NICE TO
PRISONERS BECAUSE I COULD END

127
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,130
UP IN THERE WITH THEM.

128
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,130
ANOTHER
THING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CUBA

129
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,500
AND COMMUNISM -- ALL IT WILL
TAKE IS A PHONE CALL FROM PUTIN.

130
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,130
HEY, DID I TELL YOU TO DO THAT?

131
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,090
THEN HE WOULD SAY, I'M SORRY.

132
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,320
IT'S NOT JUST PANDERING, THIS
ADMINISTRATION -- IT WAS THE

133
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,250
SAME THING WITH COMEY, WHEN THE
INITIAL STORY CAME OUT, THEY

134
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,320
WERE PROTECTING HILLARY'S --
THEY AREN'T EVEN BOTHERING TO

135
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,100
TRY TO LIE ANYMORE.

136
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,090
THAT USED TO
BE MORE CREATIVE AND PUT EFFORT

137
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,090
INTO IT.

138
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,260
HE'S A SLOPPY LIAR.

139
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,350
THIS ISN'T EVEN A GOOD TRY.

140
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,030
LIKE YOU SAID, BEN, THE MOMENT

141
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,760
HE SAID WE ARE STILL GOING TO
ALLOW THE INVESTMENTS BECAUSE

142
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,090
ALL THE CORPORATIONS SAID YOU
BETTER BELIEVE WE WILL ALLOW THE

143
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,090
INVESTMENTS --

144
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,180
MARRIOTT ALREADY HAS A HOTEL
THERE, THAT'S UNAFFECTED.

145
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,510
AND CUBA USED TO BE THE SPOT.

146
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,640
CUBA USED TO BE THE HOTSPOT TO

147
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,410
GO TO GAMBLE, HANG OUT, AND THEY
WANT TO BUILD THAT AGAIN.

148
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,650
OF COURSE THEY DO.

149
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,280
THE
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS

150
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,380
WANTED TO DICTATE WHAT GOES ON
IN CUBA.

151
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,380
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

152
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,740
WE ALLOWED AMNESTY FOR CUBANS
WAS BECAUSE THE AMERICAN

153
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,690
GOVERNMENT WAS HUFFING AND
PUFFING THAT THEY DIDN'T GET TO

154
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,960
HAVE BATISTA EMPOWER ANYMORE OR
HAVE A SAY OVER WHO WAS IN

155
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,420
CHARGE IN CUBA ANYMORE.

156
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,811
AND THE
WHOLE CUBAN AMNESTY THING, THINK

157
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:54,360
ABOUT THE DOUBLE STANDARD THERE.

158
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,470
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU COME

159
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,290
FROM A COUNTRY LIKE MEXICO WHERE
YOU ARE ALSO BEING PERSECUTED,

160
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,260
OR COMING FROM SYRIA WHERE THERE
IS EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT

161
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,890
TARGETING INNOCENT CIVILIANS
INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN --

162
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,670
DOESN'T MATTER, CUBANS GET
AMNESTY BECAUSE WE HAD

163
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,670
COMMUNISM.

164
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,780
BUT EVERYONE ELSE
BEING PERSECUTED AND WHOSE LIVES

165
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,230
ARE AT RISK DOESN'T MATTER.

166
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,770
BY
THE WAY, I LOVE CUBANS, THIS HAS

167
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,260
NOTHING TO DO WITH I DON'T LIKE
CUBANS AND THEY SHOULDN'T GET

168
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,170
AMNESTY, I'M JUST SAYING THE
DOUBLE STANDARD WAS RIDICULOUS

169
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,300
AND THE REASON IT WAS PUT IN
PLACE IS BECAUSE THE UNITED

170
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,890
STATES WANTED TO DICTATE WHAT
WAS GOING ON IN THAT

171
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,710
COUNTRY, AND THAT'S IT.

172
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,630
BATISTA WAS A TERRIBLE GUY.

173
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,229
THAT SAID, I WENT TO CUBA IN

174
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:42,419
1998, MY DAD WROTE A BOOK ABOUT
CASTRO, HE WAS THERE FOR A LONG

175
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,340
TIME AND THOUGHT WE
MISREPRESENTED CASTRO IN MANY

176
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,130
WAYS -- THAT SAID, HE'S A
COMMUNIST DICTATOR.

177
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,130
YOU WALK

178
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,200
AROUND AND ON THE STREET CORNERS
IN 1998 AND 99 WHEN I WENT,

179
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,310
THERE WERE GUYS WITH BERETS AND
MILITARY UNIFORMS HOLDING

180
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,110
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

181
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,630
I COULD
DO WHATEVER I WANT, I'M A

182
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,150
FOREIGNER -- I COULD STAY IN THE
NICEST HOTELS, I CAN GO OUT TO

183
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,440
BARS AND DRINK, THEY DON'T CARE.

184
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,560
THEY ARE WATCHING THEIR OWN

185
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
PEOPLE.

186
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,330
IT WAS SPOOKY.

187
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,821
BUT THEY
ARE 90 MILES FROM HERE, FROM THE

188
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,561
UNITED STATES, AND OBVIOUSLY
THIS IS A COUNTRY -- IF YOU

189
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:22,800
THINK WE ARE A POWER, THIS IS IN
OUR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE, WE

190
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,810
SHOULD TRY TO EXACT SOME
INFLUENCE.

191
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,810
THAT'S WHAT THIS

192
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:31,250
POLICY WOULD HAVE DONE AFTER 57
YEARS OF THE DUMBEST, MOST

193
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,650
INEFFECTIVE POLICY.

194
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,250
IF IT
WORKED, IF THE EMBARGO HAD

195
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,870
WORKED AND IN 19 CITY SEVEN CUBA
WAS LIKE, WE CAN'T DO IT WITH

196
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,360
THE SOVIETS, WE ARE COMING
ABOARD, WE ARE SWITCHING -- BUT

197
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,370
IT DIDN'T EVEN WORK AFTER THE
SOVIETS FELL.

198
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,370
WE WERE TOO DUMB

199
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,110
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FALL OF
COMMUNISM.

200
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,190
THE WHOLE COUNTRY

201
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,830
DESPERATELY NEEDS A COAT OF
PAINT, IT GOT PAINTED IN 1959

202
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,650
AND NEVER AGAIN, THE PEOPLE WHO
SHOULD BE DYING TO GET IN OUR

203
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,650
SHERWIN-WILLIAMS.

204
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,450
THEY COULD
MAKE MILLIONS THERE.

205
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,830
THE CASINO BUSINESS WANTS TO
GO IN, AND IF THERE IS ONE

206
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,650
BUSINESS THAT WON'T BE BOTHERED
WITH DONALD TRUMP, IT'S THE

207
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,950
CASINO BUSINESS.

208
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:14,320
WE GAVE YOU A
CHANCE --

209
00:10:14,320 --> 00:00:00,000
HOW DID YOU MESS THAT UP?
