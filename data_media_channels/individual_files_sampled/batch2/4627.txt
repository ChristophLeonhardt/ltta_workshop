yes one of the greatest parades I've ever seen and to a large extent because of what I witnessed we make do something like that on July 4th why she's down well he didn't get the military parade on the 4th of July this year so the White House started looking at a special Veterans Day parade but now that's not happening either the president canceled the parade today citing the expense which reports noted could cost more than 90 million dollars here with me now is john sulston Iraq war veteran and the chairman of vote vets a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of veterans and Sam cedar MSNBC contributor and host of the majority report gents good to have you here John let me start with you what are your thoughts on the an even if I want to give you space to talk about your thoughts on the parade it was a stupid idea but what do you thought what are your thoughts on the cancellation of the parade thank god there's no reason than all of our troops who serving overseas have to march down the parade or march down Constitution Avenue to appease Donald Trump's ego cost a lot of money it affects training and affects readiness and it's reminiscent of this you know dick type dictator type environment that Donald Trump's established where it's similar to the stuff we'd see in North Korea it's why he likes country and yes but it's of no benefit for a military we're proud to see it canceled in fact we even applied next year on Veterans Day to have a 5k run to benefit veterans homelessness in DC on the exact same time as you you've appointed to be on the mall in a year from now on Veterans Day so that they get a parade absolutely to benefit veterans homelessness so we can show Donald Trump you know what Veterans Day should be all about which is helping veterans and not his own ego all right look there are about me correct me if I'm wrong there probably about 40,000 homeless veterans around the country veterans are experiencing very high suicide rates 22 percent higher for the veteran community than for the community at large opioid addiction is higher amongst veterans I mean if you got money to spend on anything military they're a better place is suspended than on a parade yeah I think that not the money number crushed him in the end but there's there's been a lot of people inside the Armed Forces that didn't support the parade there's a lot of tension with the Pentagon in the White House there's a lot of tension with veterans groups the white house and I think in the end this thing just got too far down the line where it cost so much money that Trump didn't want to really own it any longer and I don't think the Pentagon really wanted to do it we've been you know pounding it vote that's opposing the parade from day one just because it's a ridiculous preposterous idea the public didn't want it and in the ends you know he found a way to do what he always does which is lose but try to turn it into a win let me just ask you this Sam we were just talking to congressman Raskin about what the to-do list for Democrats would be if they won the house I you know I don't he did want to jinx it by saying that was going to happen but the 538 forecast model says Republicans have a one in four chance of retaining the house better odds than Donald Trump had to win the election that's true that's true but it's also better odds for the Democrats than you might have imagined it may be sixteen months ago I mean I think you know who's to say but we're going to get a better sense particularly as we get it further into September when we get a sense of who the electorate it is and everything that we've seen up to this point is that Democrats are far more energized and so which is not typically the case though historically Republicans have shown out in midterms more than Democrats I mean a greater proportion political scientists will tell you that the party that's out of power will tend to show up more Democrats less so underperform that a little bit but there's just a tremendous amount of energy on on the Left and there's really I don't know that there's really much that can change between now and Election Day that will change that dynamic let's talk about these this this parade business again the VA has it's a massive Department it's it's bigger than most people think yeah in the in the division of the VA that deals with health care they have 33,000 vacancies right I mean what does President Trump get out of this parade nonsense self-gratification I think it makes him feel important you know I guess theoretically everybody would be saluting him when they walk by I mean even the conversation about he said well now we're not gonna have a parade so we can buy more jets that's actually not the problem right now with the US military we're not short of jets we were the doctors we were sort of treatment we just added 10 percent to the military budget out of thin air seventy billion dollars we have a massive massive military budget it doesn't it doesn't need to be half the size we are so much and the rest of the world combined that it's ridiculous I mean so the idea that we would buy more jets this is just him making excuses I don't even think the 92 million jet for you no no of course let me ask you this John there you guys are public has a story about how the VA is not really being run by anybody it's being run by a bunch of Trump cronies without any particular accountability and vote vets is actually suing the Veterans Administration over this someone has to do something and there's a lot of people that have been looking at the VA including vote that's fine a lot of information either they're trying to figure out who's in charge why was Shokan fire why is privatization being pushed so hard by this administration ProPublica got the story that is great they exposed the fact that some you know multi millionaires like Perlmutter from Marvel Comics books is running the VA from our logo that's great what our suit does what democracy forward is it basically says stop this is a violation of the law you can't just have your kitchen cabinet running the the Department of Veterans Affairs from people that are in your club because there's all these laws and rules that dictate who's allowed to be on a committee that advises an agency like the Department of Veterans Affairs so basically what we're asking for is we're gonna take this out of the dark we're gonna bring into light and we're gonna put veterans into the conversation and it basically is a stop this right now and tell us everything that's happens and we pushed it over to the courts in a wait for a decision from a judge veterans should be at the front of any conversation that has the word military in it in this country absolutely earlier than jets guys thanks very much John salts and Sam cedar thanks for being here hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to
