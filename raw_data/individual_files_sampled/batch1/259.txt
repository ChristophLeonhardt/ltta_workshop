on April 7th at least 70 Syrian residents of the rebel-held town of Duma were killed in a suspected chemical weapons attack and hundreds more injured the Syrian government is once again accused of carrying out the attack and there's once again denied any responsibility for it but Donald Trump who now calls Bashar al-assad a gas killing animal wants to take matters into his own hands so will military action by the United States deter the future use of banned chemical weapons or is the u.s. president dragging the West into a new war would not just Assad but with Russia and Iran joining me in the arena to debate this are Eli Lake a columnist for Bloomberg view who specializes in national security matters and Glenn Greenwald the Pulitzer Prize winning author and co-founder of the intercept thank you both for joining me on upfront Glenn let me start with you when chemical weapons are repeatedly deployed in Syria the international community led by the United States can't sit back and do nothing can it right so this idea that the United States or its allies have to engage in military actions for humanitarian purposes was a major part of the case of the Iraq war obviously there were other arguments but the idea that Saddam had gassed his own people that he was suppressing his own people that we were coming to liberate the Iraqis that was an important part of the arguments lots of people were making back in 2002 2003 and I don't think that turned out very well for the people we were supposedly trying to help the same is true when it came time for the intervention in Libya we claimed that we were gonna help the Libyan people by freeing them from Qaddafi we killed Gaddafi and then paid very little attention to what happened in Libya in the aftermath which was even worse suffering worse chaos militia rule the return of the slave trade so I think the record of people who claimed that the United States are going to drop bombs in order to bring happiness or protect people in the world is an extremely poor one that's generally the excuse that's used for geopolitical motives that are really driving the war and not actually the real reason that it's being done which in turn means that the results are often quite poor but Glenn a lot of Syrians who are opposed to Assad would say we tried it your way we tried the no us no-fly zone no US assault on Assad and hundreds of thousands of people are dead so there's no point comparing it to Libya or other interventions because the interventionists still resulted in hundreds of thousands of dead Syrians yeah I mean that's always you know a problem is that you can take a problem in the world that's really horrendous as this year as the civil war in Syria to any decent person obviously is and then just immediately assume that you as a foreign country thousands of miles away are capable with your military of improving that situation because that's something that you want to believe but oftentimes all you can do the only options available to you are ones that make it worse why doesn't that's wrong I think there are plenty of examples of times when American led airpower such as the no-fly zone in northern Iraq between the two Gulf Wars that and that first of all stopped a horrible slaughter of the Kurds and second of all it created the space for the creation of the Kurdistan Regional Government now I wouldn't compare the Kurdistan Regional Government today in northern Iraq to Switzerland or France but it's certainly better than almost all of the other alternatives in the region and that was only possible because American airpower was protecting that region from Saddam Hussein second of all the comparison is a little bit off that Glenn makes in my view because you know the lead-up to the 2003 war was really about in for I'm sorry the Iraq war from 2003 was really about enforcing the ceasefire that ended the 1991 Gulf War which required Saddam Hussein to account for and dispose of his weapons of mass destruction and part of the X but part of the justification was that in the end of the iran-iraq war in 1989 Saddam Hussein had used chemical weapons against Kurds yet again in Halabja but at the time the US policy was that Saddam Hussein was largely an ally and still sold grain credits to the Saddam Hussein so there really wasn't much of a moral like to stand on this is responding in the moment to a chemical weapons attack it is not an isolated incident it's not a one-off we've seen chemical agent used in screw Paul in the UK we have seen kim jeong-hoon use it to kill his half-brother it is becoming unfortunately to use an important term of the moment normalised if you want to reverse that trend bashar al-assad must pay a very heavy price ideally I would like him to stand trial for his crimes against the Syrian people in a Revolutionary Tribunal after you know a glory but if that doesn't necessarily happen someone needs to step in because if it is perceived someone is the United States well who else is it going to be the United States is the the still remains the leader of the world if Glenn Greenwald would not like that anymore that's fine but if the United States does not do this no one will well that's all scale in Greenwald so first of all I think it's an important point that was raised which is that you know Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons at the time that he was an ally of the United States and yet the United States didn't go in punish Sodom Hussein for doing that because the United States isn't driven by humanitarianism they're not driven by opposition to chemical weapons they're driven by geopolitical interest and what we have here in the case of Eli in the case of lots of people are inside the trunk government the reality is is that they have a geopolitical side in the Middle East and that geopolitical side is on the side of Israel and the side of Saudi Arabia their new ally the new allies of the Israelis and against Iran and against Hezbollah and therefore taking out Assad is a way of putting the scale the finger on the scale of the side that Eli is really on which is the side of Israel on the side of Saudi Arabia and hurting Iran and humanitarianism is the pretext for doing that also other examples like creating a no-fly zone in the in in northern Iraq for the Kurds in this case what we have is a country where there is a very serious military presence on the ground of a nuclear-armed country called Russia so that if we start doing the sort of thing that would be necessary to cripple Assad's airforce or in any way harm Assad we're going to be not only bombing Russian Syrian military installations but killing lots of Russians as well so what you're talking about is a serious risk of an actual hot war between two countries that have very deep-seated animosities going back decades and thousands of missiles pointed at one in other cities with nuclear tips and archaic cold war systems ready to be triggered at any it's extraordinarily dangerous the kind of thing that Eli is talking about even though he's using very moderate tones to do it the risks are enormous in terms of having this kind of turned into a conflagration that nobody is anticipating put the cuffs on me I'm against the Iranians Glenn is correct on that and I fully would say one of the reasons I'm against Iran and I'm against Russia at this point is because they have enabled funded and supported this gastly humanitarian crisis which can't be compared to anything that Israel or Saudi Arabia or CC and Egypt has done and yes their of course their M&A compared to Yemen it's like it can't even really be Yemen in terms of the total cost and how long it's been the use of chemical weapons and everything else but more importantly the alternative to the US getting involved it's not going to be they'll just play it out and it'll be fine it's going to be a wider regional war which we're already seeing the Israelis do not want the Iranians to set up a base in Syria and they're well within their rights neither does crown prince of Saudi Arabia neither the Saudis neither the Emiratis so if you if you the the one thing that maybe could prevent an even wider conflagration at this point would be an American presence in Syria at least it is there already to stay and to stop and to push back against the Iranians and the Russians the question I have for you is Glenn is that why aren't you against them as well why do you think that they are equal belligerents in this particular contest with israel in the united states when i don't think that there's an argument there at all the problem is you I is that I don't think the message that you're claiming is going to be sent by having the u.s. attack the Assad government in this devastating way that would be necessary to really send the kind of message you're talking about I don't think the message is gonna be that's gonna be received in the world is the message that you're claiming is going to be sent everybody knows that the US has supported regimes in the past that use chemical weapons everybody knows that the US right now is supporting Israel as they slaughter journalists and peaceful protesters on the border with Gaza which is also a violation of the laws of war that you don't seem very interested in sending a message that people aren't allowed to do that everybody knows that Saudi Arabia is deliberately bombing civilians and blocking medical care and medical aid to suffering children of all kinds of hideous diseases and starvation in Yemen because we don't care about that because that's our ally doing that and that's the message that's going to be sent everybody understands outside the United States that the real reason for this military strike will be that assad is an enemy of Israel and the u.s. found an excuse to go and attack him that's the only message today we're risking a huge war in order to go do that with a person who is that who is commanding the Armed Forces who people have spent the last year saying is unstable is mentally unfit has the onset of dementia is purely driven by ego has no moral limits that's the person that we're going to be empowering to lead this extremely dangerous war with very little benefit in sight and that's why just deal with the charge that Elie made earlier I just want to get your response to that that you're soft on Iran and Russia why was his question I don't have a soft spot for Iran in Russia I think that the governments of Iran and Russia are extremely authoritarian I have nothing but bad things to say about both of those governments but there are a lot of bad governments all over the world including the closest allies at the United States and I don't think we should go to war against countries because their governments are authoritarian otherwise we'd be at war with most of our own allies and let me put Glenn's point back to you long before we finish Saudi Arabia has volunteered to be part of a coalition to help punish Assad while it's also starving blockading bombing innocent people in Yemen do you not see a problem with that in the US Commerce well I think the US should and can use its influence with Saudi Arabia as an ally and more effectively to try to mitigate that situation second of all I don't think that you can necessarily equate the rampage of the Iranians in the region or for that matter Russia which is acted like a nuclear-armed rogue now really going on more than a decade to American allies as imperfect and flawed as they are and finally I just don't think that the argument I think what this is really like you're being described is one of the biggest humanitarian crises when they say you know perfect and flawed it sounds like it's a little imperfection it's like a typo you know it says the Saudis aren't perfect that's all they're just not they have some flaws a big difference here is that in terms of raw a reality that the Iranians are responsible for the roadside bombs that have maimed and killed in excess of 2,000 Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan they are a sworn enemy they had a rogue nuclear program what were the Saudis wait a second what what would the Americans doing in Iraq what were the Americans doing in our training and Army protecting a governor write a constitution I mean I'm sorry Glenn you know try that on someone else you're basically saying that America because of its flaws because those flaws of its allies does not have any justification to ever act I think that Syria is the refutation of that because that is we're watching the consequences of non-intervention there because we feel bad that was we made mistakes before and I just don't think we're through with that we have to move on Glenn last word very briefly the United States hasn't had a policy of non-intervention in Syria it has armed the Syrian rebels to the tune of a billion dollars a year not enough to overthrow Assad but just enough to keep the war going so the United States has played a big role in the events in Syria that's far I don't think they're gonna solve the problem under Trump we'll have to leave it there Glenn Greenwald Eli Lake thank you so much for joining me in the arena you
