>>DONALD TRUMP'S ICE HOTLINE,
ESSENTIALLY AN 800-NUMBER WHERE
YOU CAN CALL TO HAVE PEOPLE
DEPORTED, IT'S CALLED VOICE, NOT
TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE VOICE, A
SHOW ON NBC, THIS IS VICTIMS OF
IMMIGRANT CRIME ENGAGEMENT, THEY
WANTED TO CALL IT VOICE FOR THEY
CAME UP WITH THE LETTERS, PEOPLE
ARE USING IT TO DEPORT HER
IN-LAWS.
ORIGINALLY IT SEEMS
LIKE IT WAS SET UP TO REPORT
VIOLENT CRIMES, BUT PEOPLE ARE
USING IT TO DEPORT THEIR
IN-LAWS.
BOING BOING REPORTS A
STUDY DONE FROM THE FREEDOM OF
INFORMATION ACT, AND HERE ARE
SOME CALLS --
>>THE NEXT ONE 
IS --
>>THAT LAST ONE IS KIND OF
TERRIFYING.
>>THIS IS A TERRIBLE USE OF THE
HOTLINE.
THE HOTLINE SHOULDN'T
EXIST, BECAUSE THIS IS A FORM OF
VIGILANTE JUSTICE AND WE AREN'T
SUPPOSED TO HAVE VIGILANTE
JUSTICE, BUT LET'S SAY SOMEONE
THAT WE REALLY DISLIKE, LIKE
SEAN HANNITY, WE FIND OUT HE'S
REALLY NOT A U.S. CITIZEN, HE
OVERSTAYED HIS VISA.
WOULD YOU
USE THIS HOTLINE?
>>YES.
>>SAME.
I'M KIND OF A HYPOCRITE.
>>EVEN ITS INTENDED USE, ONCE
IT WAS ANNOUNCED, I WAS LIKE,
THIS ISN'T GOING TO GO WELL.
IT'S INTENDED SO YOU CAN BE --
IT JUST INVITES PEOPLE TO GO,
LIKE, THAT GUY HAS GOT A MEXICO
ACCENT.
>>THAT IS TOTALLY A STATEMENT
TRUMP WOULD MAKE.
A MEXICO
ACCENT.
HE WAS SPEAKING MEXICAN.
>>I LISTEN TO THIS STUFF, IT'S
LIKE I KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WATCH ME
HERE THEY ARE LIKE EVERYTHING
HAS HAPPENED TO AIDA --
EVERYTHING HAS.
THAT'S WHY I'M A
COMEDIAN SO I CAN COPE WITH MY
TRAGEDY, MY FATHER WAS DEPORTED
THREE TIMES AND IS PROBABLY ONE
OF THE LEAST -- HE'S PROBABLY
ONE OF THE MOST HARMLESS PEOPLE
ON THE PLANET.
IT'S JUST THE
ABUSE TO CONTINUOUSLY HOLD
PEOPLE DOWN.
THESE ARE PEOPLE
THAT ARE RELATED TO YOU IN SOME
WAY, HAVE BEEN RELATED TO YOU.
YOU HAVE A CHILD.
THIS IS THE
KIND OF STUFF THAT IS BEING FED,
AN INFECTION THAT KEEPS
SPREADING.
IT WAS HERE, WE SAW
IT WHEN BARACK OBAMA WAS
PRESIDENT, TRUMP JUST BUSTED IT
WIDE OPEN AND NOW THE INFECTION
IS SPREADING ALL OVER THE PLACE,
BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF
THAT HAS CAUSED SO MUCH DIVISION
IN THIS COUNTRY, AND IT'S SO
HATEFUL.
THAT SOUNDS REALLY
HATEFUL.
SO IMAGINE IF ALL
MINORITIES GOT THEIR WHITE
FRIENDS AND SAID LISTEN, BECKY,
EVERY TIME I SEE A WHITE GUY WHO
LOOKS SUSPICIOUS WITH A BACKPACK
I WANT YOU TO CALL THE POLICE
AND REPORT HIM.
>>IT'S A FORM OF MCCARTHYISM.
AND THAT IS PROBLEMATIC, TO SAY
THE LEAST.
PROFILING PEOPLE,
GIVING AMERICANS THE GREEN LIGHT
TO GO AFTER INDIVIDUALS AND
THREATEN THEIR WELL-BEING --
IT'S NOT WHAT A LEADER IN THE
GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO DO.
AGAIN, THE GOVERNMENT IS
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT US.
AND
WHETHER YOU ARE HERE AS A U.S.
CITIZEN OR AN UNDOCUMENTED
IMMIGRANT, EVERYONE IN THE
COUNTRY IS PROTECTED BY THE
CONSTITUTION.
IT PROTECTS ALL OF
US, AND THAT IS SOMETHING A LOT
OF AMERICANS I FEEL LIKE DON'T
KNOW.
AND IF THEY DO FIND OUT
ABOUT IT THEY HAVE A HARD TIME
GRAPPLING WITH IT.
BUT THERE
HAVE BEEN SEVERAL SUPREME COURT
RULINGS INDICATING THAT
REGARDLESS OF YOUR LEGAL STATUS
THE CONSTITUTION PROTECTS YOU,
AND WE SHOULD HAVE COMMON SENSE,
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
INSTEAD OF LETTING PEOPLE LIKE
DONALD TRUMP CONTINUE TO
DIVIDE THE COUNTRY.
