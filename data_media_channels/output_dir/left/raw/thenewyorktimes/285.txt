1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,850
“If it remains a hashtag
and it remains a movement,

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,360
then it’s going to die.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,130
It’s got to become
a part of our lives —

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,490
that women should
no longer be in silence

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,010
about sexual assault.
It’s a crime.”

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,490
“This is a really unusual
moment in our history.”

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,150
“There’s sort of a magic
in the air,

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,360
that’s pushing systemic change.”

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,680
“I think that the Academy
can bring a little

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,310
pressure to bear
on agencies and studios.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,775
You know, I don’t know
who else really can.”

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,950
“Tonight will be a continued
message, a voice.”

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,020
“Hollywood sets a standard
and it helps raise the bar.

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,770
And it has trickled out
into other fields.

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,030
But I think the focus
has to shift at this point.”

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,590
“I’ve been a feminist for years,

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,640
and we fought for many rights.

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,580
But slowly it moves.”

19
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,480
“As long as we continue to
support each other as women,

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,890
Time’s Up will never go away.

21
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,760
And as long as the
consequences remain,

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,300
you know, people will stop
doing what they’re doing.”

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,160
“As I become more
and more of a producer,

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,830
it’s very important
for me to continue

25
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,850
to make sure that
we hire not only

26
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,930
women in front of the
camera and as directors

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,670
but women as
cinematographers

28
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,990
and all the other
positions as well.

29
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,490
And I think we just have to do that

30
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,520
until we don’t have to do
it anymore. Until it’s equal.”

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,180
“You know, generally we need
to broaden the conversation.

32
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,180
So white, straight men
are asked to comment

33
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,560
on this on the red carpet.

34
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,970
You know, sometimes
it works out where

35
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,190
men talk about the craft,
women talk about the issues.

36
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,010
And I think men should be forced
to interrogate their identity.

37
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,050
I’m constantly interrogating
what it means to be a woman.

38
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,030
I’m constantly asked to figure out
what it means to be black.

39
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,530
I’m constantly asked to interrogate
what it means to be a lesbian.”

40
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,890
“If you study ancient civilizations
that have lasted a long time —

41
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,530
it’s because they put
women up in the society.

42
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,740
We held women up.

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,420
And I think that is something
that we can learn from.

44
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,050
And I think it’s a beautiful
thing, you know?

45
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,100
I love my mama.”

46
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,990
“It makes me very excited
for the new generations.

47
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,790
And I hope they don’t forget,

48
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,230
so they can appreciate the opportunities,

49
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:04,130
and they work harder than ever
so that we can be proven right.

50
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,918
That the female force,
it’s an untapped potential

51
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:11,450
that can really make
a difference everywhere.”

52
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,610
“There’s probably a lot of things
wrong about Hollywood,

53
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,253
but I stay away from that part.

54
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:18,050
And I don’t allow myself
to be in places I shouldn’t.

55
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,670
That’s how you fix it.

56
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,003
Know your surroundings.

57
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:22,956
And if you don’t know,
wear a chastity belt.”

58
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:24,910
“Legislation needs
to be passed;

59
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,320
people need to be
held accountable

60
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,460
for what they’ve done.”

61
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,720
“I can’t think of what the
legislative way would be.

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,570
But I always think of
same-sex marriage

63
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,330
as, like, that was a really —
they changed the law.

64
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,470
And I don’t know
what came first,

65
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,410
but the thinking
and the law changed,

66
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,300
and the world really
changed around that.

67
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,960
I hope #MeToo has
the same effect.”

68
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,270
“If we can continue
to find purpose —

69
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,390
and me at my
particular age —

70
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,540
purpose in
what we do.

71
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,690
That purpose, we carry that
translated into another way,

72
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,230
in which we deal
with ordinary citizens

73
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,240
and young actors
and young producers

74
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,700
and young directors

75
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,740
and young actresses
who are coming up.”

76
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,820
“Thank you so much.”

77
00:03:01,820 --> 00:00:00,000
“Have a great night.”
