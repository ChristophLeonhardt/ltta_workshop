tonight the rebel goes to the conservative convention in Halifax it's August 24th and you're watching the Ezra Levin show why should others go to jail on your a biggest carbon consumer i know theres 8500 customers here and you won't give them an answer here once a year with the sign and you feel morally superior welcome from Halifax what a gorgeous day a little bit overcast 26 degrees we are in town for the Conservative Party convention leader Andrew Shearer started the convention with a bang not fired from him but at him by Maxine Burnie a Mexican Bernie a lost Andrew Shearer in the leadership race 15 months ago by about 1% and Andrew sure never managed to absorb Maxine Bernie a property probably in the party that there really is job 1 for any new leader in a contest is to do his best to mollify his rivals and if possible make them part of the team I think of Stephen Harper and how he fused stock weld aides and his team of course you can go further back in time to see how Jean chr√©tien took Paul Martin and made him an important asset at least for 10 years till their date aunt fell apart unfortunately Andrew Shearer did not or could not or would not do that with Maxine Bernie a and Bernie ain't quit the party the day before the convention announcing at a press conference in Ottawa that he was going to start his own party here take a quick look if we want conservative principles to win the bottle of ideas we have to defend them openly with passion and with conviction that is what I want to do and this is why as of today I am no longer a member of the Conservative Party of Canada I want to do politics differently I will find another way to give a voice to million of Canadians and I will continue to fight for freedom responsibility fairness and respect yes see well as you know I am sympathetic to Maxime Bernier for a number of reasons I find him charming and charismatic I like the fact that he has courage especially on the subjects that so many other conservatives are afraid of whether it's extreme multiculturalism open borders immigration or of course Supply Management which is the sanitized name for quotas for Canada's dairy cartels Maxime did not win though and it was not his place to set key policy he was demoted earlier this year by Andrew Shearer and it looked like he was heading for a firing but he fired himself and my first thought was that's a bad idea if your goal was promote your policies do so within the infrastructure of the party do so at the convention do so at the policy debates do so in the votes for little executives in this writing or that put your own people in place and come to terms with the current leader Andrew Shearer to be a deputy of some sort of deputy in charge of Quebec deaf committee in charge of dairy cartels or whatever if you can't if you can convince him and how would that be a proposition that Maxime Bernie could lose by because if Andrew Shearer won the next election that would likely rely on a strong showing in Quebec which would be to Maxine Bernie's credit and the very least he would be a senior cabinet minister ends if as many people think and Russia will not win the next election scheduled for last year then Maxime Bernier would be the heir apparent even more so right now he's the obvious only other rival in the party for the leadership if he spent one year investing in the party promoting it promoting its ideas he would be there to catch the prize when Andrew sure drops it now neither of those things will happen a lot of his policy energy has been taken away from the party his supporters are disheartened because he's abandoned the party and we'll split the right and of course the idea of setting up his own party infrastructure is not only a daunting task but it's a zero-sum game I put it to you every vote he gets will likely be taken away from the Conservative Party so that's the big headline there are other little details at this policy convention alas we're not there to cover the trivial my new ship from within the party itself because after Shearer and his wisdom has banned the rebel but only the rebel from reporting from inside the conference I've told you about this before it's really bizarre we have our disagreements with Andrew Shearer as we do with Maxime Bernie as we did with Stephen Harper as we do with any leader on the right obviously there are far fewer disagreements we have with politicians on the right than we do with those on the left or the weird left like Justin Trudeau yet we've never been kicked out of an event by the Liberals I should say Sheila GaN Reid was briefly kicked out of the Alberta legislature by an armed sheriff but they back down after the NDP was humiliated for their censorship remember this clip we already spoke to Darcy Henson he said there should be no problem that's a bizarre pattern or precedent a role model for Andrew Shearer to follow even more bizarre given Andrew sheers public statements that he deeply truly cares about freedom of speech this is a video he put out just this week I believe freedom of speech is coming under attack because sometimes it is inconvenient to certain people you know certain people have a political agenda don't even want there to be a debate about certain things sometimes things are said that others disagree with them sometimes it is maybe a offensive it hurts other people's feelings but that doesn't mean that we can justify that to to to curtail or limit or infringe upon such a fundamental freedoms it doesn't hurt my feelings particularly much to be kept out from meeting rooms where excruciating ly boring seminars are held in fact I put it to you that most members of the party lounge around in the corridor skip it sing with each other there are some exciting policy moments on debates and there will be some keynote speeches but it it's more the bizarreness of keeping the rebel out of the conference it would be akin to the Republican Party banning Fox News because of some trivial disagreement the excuses are ever-changing on one time the party said is because we criticize them in 2017 another time they said it's because we're an activist group well there are 24 activist groups that are registered at the convention I say we're activists journalists but in any event that excuse doesn't watch but it's not actually about the excuses it's about a party that has its priorities wrong and that's the central thesis of my monologue today that I'm doing on the pier here in Halifax without notes is that the key job for Andrew Shearer over the past 15 months was to unify the party behind him a party that he just squeaked into the leadership of with less than 1% March and/or he got he got 51% rather that was his key job and he did not do it what was bizarre to me about Maxine Bernier statements at his press conference this week was that Andrew Shearer hadn't even talked to him in well over a week despite daily eruptions between Bernier and other MPs I think that Andrew Shearer is risk averse and he's passive and he lacks the kind of courage to make brutal decisions that are sometimes necessary and when I mean brutal I mean demanding discipline from his own MPs hiring firing promoting he lacked the courage to deal with the Bernier matter until Bernier took himself out I don't think that Andrew Shearer is any stronger he may have a tighter grip on the conservative party today but it is a smaller conservative party Stephen Harper spent years to unite the right Andrew Shearer and Maxine Bernier with their combined errors have divided the right but I think the fact that Andrew Shearer has banned the rebel and the fact that he mishandled Maxine Burnie and I say again Burnie I made the wrong decision in my mind for several points of view but the fact that Andrew she let it come to pass and the fact that he banned us I believe they are different manifestations of the same problem they both diagnosed the same ailment and it's that Andrew Shearer is not yet the leader he needs to be and I want to give you a bizarre example and it's from the media like I said we're here at the convention we're meeting hundreds of our fans and friends we're saying hi to anyone we want it's it's a love-in for us like it was at the last conservative convention we're having a hospitality party tonight where we're inviting hundreds of people of RSVP'd we see MPs we see senators we see staff I'll tell you one quick anecdote before I get to my main point I bumped into a candidate from the Lower Mainland in BC who said he was getting so much flak from his grassroots members about the ban on the rebel and he showed me his phone that had all these messages he said Ezra can I please have a selfie picture with you to send to my constituents to prove to them that I don't hate the rebel like Andrew here does it was a funny exchange in yes of course they did pose with them even Andrew sheers some of Andrews own personal staff had a friendly hello to us and we spoke at great length and they don't understand it either but I want to show you what's going on I'm gonna read to you from a story in The Globe and Mail that was posted today and it was called by The Globe and Mail a top story so this wasn't a little trivial story this was not a little colorful anecdote The Globe and Mail literally called this a top story and I'm gonna read it to you and it goes to both the banning of the rebel and the larger problem in the Conservative Party and you tell me if I'm right or wrong the story was written by one of the global males political columnist but I really think she's more a gossip columnist her name is Laura Stone and here's the headline you just got I love this top conservative aide seen speaking to rebel media who are banned from party convention that that's it it's it's like oh who did you pass a note to in gym class this is like childish grade school gossip but let me read a little bit more because I'm coming to my point here conservative leader Andrew sheers national campaign manager was seen speaking with members of rebel media outside of the party's convention in Halifax even though the far-right website is barred from covering the event for being an activist group we're not barred from covering the event we're covering it quite well we're just part from coming in there their meetings Hamish Marshall who will spearhead the Conservative Party's federal election efforts was spotted speaking to members of the outlets known for its anti-muslim rhetoric on a restaurant patio as the party's convention kicked off on Thursday The Globe and Mail was provided with photographs of actually was it was it surveillance footage who did you hire private I we were we were sitting on a patio or the right-wing outlet is banned from covering the convention no we're not we're covering it we're covering it more in more fairness and more detail than the globe is banned from covering the convention but some of its representatives including founder Ezreal events he's terrible are in Halifax I have been spotted here and will be hosting a party that's the worst off-site on Friday night mister Marshall was seen speaking with contributor Sheila gun Reid and two others but not mister lavance this goes on for hundreds and hundreds of words quote we don't give media accreditation to activist groups conservative party spokesman Corey Hahn said well that's that's just not true here's a list of 24 activist groups they've given accreditation to including a group that promoted the m103 Islamophobia censorship motion so that this is not true and that's his third excuse in or but it's not about the excuses I'm gonna get back to why his excuses is so funny in a minute mister Marshall was once listed as a director of the conservative news outlet but has since been removed no one removed him he left he left to go work for Anders here and said he was severing ties with the organization he also shared Toronto office space with the company during the tory leadership race although he said he never discussed campaign matters that's true when asked why he was speaking with members of the outlets mr. Marshall said he simply stopped by to say hello and they quote him ready I just said hi to somebody on the street mr. Marshall told the globe when asked if he thinks the group should be able to cover the convention mr. Marshall said he's not involved in the media accreditation process and and I'm I'm not gonna go on it goes on and on and on and on and this was a top story that Hamish literally said hi to Sheila on the street this was a top story here's here's why this story makes me laugh and makes me cry at the same time and here's why this story is more than just a vanity name-check of me or just a goofy little colorful anecdote here's why this story is important first of all it shows the bad faith of the media this is allegedly Canada's newspaper of record the Mighty Globe and Mail and they think a little hey hi hi on the street between the rebel and and our friend our former director and an ally and buddy is a top story I've that that's fake news at its core I mean it is accurate they did say hi but to call that a top story isn't that the definition of fake news who's covering the conservative conference better I grant you they've got the hey hi beat covered better than we do that is correct the the true policies and ideologies not so much the globe so they're giving that the top story billing they're actually not covering news that is actually not news that is them attempting to D platform us D person us make it so that anyone in the party is tariff of saying hello to us that they're gonna have to do a lot more top stories because we yesterday we had dinner outside the convention center just as a Mexican restaurant I was I mean you know me I like to snack a teeny bit I was on my feet probably a hundred times it's the most exercise that's the first meal I've ever had where I lost weights because I was up and down and up and down and up and down saying hi a hundred people coming over to say hi there were even some hugs that's a top story for you my point is that is not a real news story it is not real news that I said hello it's an attempt to terrify politically the conservative party from talking to people who they think of the wrong opinions it is not news that Sheila said hi to Hamish their former colleagues they're friendly enough there's no even if they weren't it's civil to say hello it is not a top news story to report that but the purpose was not news the purpose was to say we're watching you conservatives and if you dare consort with a are competitors at the rebel and be our ideological competitors we will shame you and name you so it's not even news but here's the second point and this goes did the problem with Andrew Scheer why did Corey Hahn senior communication staffer and why did Hamish Marshall himself feel the need to dignify this stupid fake news story with an answer at all why wasn't there answer f off or if they were being more communications professionals that's a ridiculous question I'm busy or probably the best answer is not even to reply why did they feel the need to answer such an obviously bad faith non news gossip innuendo question why did they feel the need to come up with talking points and to justify well we kept them out because they're an activist or I swear I was only saying hi please don't be mad at me why did Hamish who's a friend of mine and Corey who I why did they feel the need to oblige such a stupid question from the media party and therein you find Andrew sheers chief problem Andrew sheers worst enemy in the 2019 election will not be Justin Trudeau possibly the laziest man in Canadian politics possibly the least articulate man when he's off a teleprompter possibly the most thin-skinned man you seen him last shout at that grandma the other week in Quebec you've seen him swear in Parliament you've seen him elbow an MP Justin Trudeau himself is actually a weak candidate and his stick dancing the selfies the costume is wearing thin on Canadians Justin Trudeau is not Andrew sheers opponent the media party is that's what Maxine Bernier got right last week calling CBC fake news calling rosemary Barton despicable and that's what Hamish and Cory got wrong in this stupid front page non story in The Globe and Mail Sheila said hi and Hamish said hey oh I swear I swear that's all we said I'm so sorry master I won't do it again anyone who submits to the Global Mail the CBC the CTV or the rest of the media party is assuring that they will not win the next election because not only are they giving oxygen to those Liars in the mainstream media they're allowing their mind to be colonized by them and they're allowing the friends and enemies their causes and platforms to be governed by them the day that Hamish and Korey and Andrew Shearer himself can look the CBC in the eyes can look The Globe and Mail in the eyes and say go to hell you fake news liars is the first step on their victory in the election and if they continue to hide under the bed and do what they're told they will lose covering the conservative convention from Halifax I'm as real levan and you stay with us because we've got a couple of interesting interviews by our Sheila gunnery Moorhead well we're out here in Halifax on the Atlantic coast but we have lots of friends from the entire country here especially from the West Sheila caught up with Prem Singh to see what she's up to in terms of grassroots conservative activism so joining me right now is Alberta conservative activist Prem Singh now Prem you're a longtime conservative activist but you're not just an activist you're sort of starting influential movements where you see a void for example you helped found Alberta count weight which started the Jason Kenney juggernaut you started having those conversations before even he did before we knew that he would be the guy and you also were influential and starting saved Calgary so which is Phil's an amazing void where I think there's a real deficit of accountability in municipal politics where conservatives have sort of walked off the field but you're starting something new yes we are what we learned from Alberta can't wait was look both the party and the party establishments were against unity and sometimes you have to go against what establishment wants and you have to break that up and that's what we did we facilitated and started that structural change and now we have the UCP and with respect to save Calgary yeah it's it's a municipal grassroots watchdog and so I thought what we need to do is have a federal grassroots movement and we're a pretty diverse Bunch I'm the oldest person and it's our job and what we'd like to do is train young young people and we had our initial training program where it was very we trained them in political theory but also practical training they've learned about nation builder they're all nation builders certified they've learned about social media and just advocacy what we would like to do is educate across the board regardless of their partisanship on issues that they do want to learn and talk about education electricity the energy are our resources our forestry all of these issues talk about borders talk about immigration all the issues that people on the street everyday people want to talk about this whole you know maybe our Prime Minister is half right when he says diversity is strength but he's missing the boat on something it's diversity of thoughts is our strength and we can't suppress ideas and we can't surround our parties with sycophants we need to be able to have new ideas fresh ideas break up the establishment let the next generation come in and these politicians and our parties they don't they work for us and we seem to have it the opposite so it's up to us as grassroots to unite become educated become engaged it doesn't matter what party or what stripe you are but we all have to get active in and be engaged and hold our politicians and these parties to account I do think that when you have fresh you new ideas and you're able to talk about them instead of suppressing them the best always rises to the top and that's how we're going to be able to create change and have bold ideas and bold policies so we're also doing a speaker series and we'll have special guests from across the world we're excited about our first one it's gonna be Tucker Carlson on September 22nd so we're pretty excited and we will have guests from all across the spectrum we'll probably have for a year and yes our biggest thing in sorry I forgot to mention what it's called Canadians for democracy and prosperity because I do believe that Canadians from all walks of life all want democracy and we all want prosperity for everybody so we think it's important to have the grassroots involved and I think it's important for this to be a self-sustaining endeavor it might take us a bit of time to get there but that is our goal now but I really hope that your organization does is it as a conservative I hope it changes the fact that within this convention today there are the official conservative types that think that there are things that we cannot talk about that we simply cannot talk about like immigration levels like Supply Management to punch back against this idea that diversity of color is our strength as opposed to diversity of ideas do you think that you'll be able to sort of reset the concern the official conservative types when you do this because you do have a history of sort of forcing official conservatives to hit the reset button that is our goal I don't think that we need to be afraid to speak our mind within reason we're not out here just because I have a different thought than you that doesn't make me a racist or a xenophobe or everything else that no from your your white supremacists so you know we have to get over that hump we have to stop apologizing and being afraid because right now we've created our language is a minefield and whatever we say we're afraid that we're going to say something wrong that's going to upset somebody and then we're apologizing we need to stop as Canadians apologizing stop apologizing for our resources we need to stand up for ourselves we we have to we're at a crossroads our country is and we do have to make a change if we are going to be competitive in the world and we have to look out for our own security our own economy we can't leave it up to the politicians we have to demand these things so Prem how do people get in touch with you how do they support your new endeavor and how do they get to go to Tucker Carlson well they could email us at info at democracy and prosperity dot CA and otherwise you can get a hold of me through Alberta can't wait or save Calgary great thanks so much for him good luck thank you well one of the policy issues that has divided the Conservative Party and in fact was the chief issue cited by Maxine Bernier when he quit the party was Andrew Shearer support for the dairy cartel in Canada which has a sanitized name it goes by Supply Management's Sheila GaN reads spoke with Clinton DeVoe about that issue it's the very first afternoon of the Conservative Party convention here in Halifax and I found someone who wants to end supply management where are you from and why can't you stand supply management well I'm from the Halifax area and I split my time between Ottawa and Halifax for work and I I'm not connected in politics as far as a career goes but why why are you against supply management so I'm opposed to Supply Management because it charges as a consumer we face inflated prices on basic food items like eggs milk poultry it limits our choice that's available on the grocery shelf and for those reasons it's just not conservative it's a terrible policy that was brought in by Pierre Elliot Trudeau in 1972 and no real conservative in good conscience can support supply management so I see that you've been giving out buttons what is the reception been like for you as you stand outside this conference where it is official policy of the Conservative Party to support supply management well the reception has been absolutely phenomenal so there's there's two types of reception the first one is from the general membership of the party I've actually emptied out three bags like this one this is my fourth one and we're just a couple hours into it with just a couple hours into this and anyone that's connected to the party structure I like to call the elites of the party they just snub your nose and and don't want to look at you and ignore you and what about the regular people regular people love it they've been buying they've been not buying they've been taking the button they've been putting them on their jackets their backpacks just running around with them they really really love them so there is a motion about Supply Management that may or may not make it to the floor what have you heard about what's going on with that motion well the feeling that I've been hearing from the regular members is that the process unfortunately sounds like it might be a fixed process because they only allow ten policy resolutions to come to the floor and Supply Management is number 26 or 27 on the list and they give you a maximum of three hours to debate policy which means there's a good chance that the clock will be run out and supply management won't even make it to the floor so we just heard this afternoon that max Bernier the biggest I guess the biggest activists within caucus against Supply Management has left the conservative caucus and it sounds like so far he'll sit as an independent what effect do you think that's going to have on the movement both within the party and outside the party to end Supply Management well I think that the grassroots membership is ready to end Supply Management the problem is is the party for whatever reason doesn't want to end it and what I see the effect of that is it's going to tear the party apart and I think that it's becoming more and more likely that we are going to see a new Conservative Party that's most likely going to be created as more and more members from Newfoundland to British Columbia give up if the party is not prepared to move on these basic conservative ideas you know as an Alberta I would really hate to see that we just spent ten years wandering in the wilderness with a fractured Conservative Party do you feel like there is something that could have been done before today to prevent supply management from becoming such a divisive thing both within caucus but even in our trade deals with our friends in the United States most definitely so in regards to the United States they've made it very clear that unless Canada phases out apply management over five years there will be no NAFTA deal and you're from Alberta Alberta and Saskatchewan energy business depends on trade if we start seeing a tightening of the border and trade agreements being thrown out the window because of egg and milk farmers that is going to do great harm to Saskatchewan and Alberta energy sector most of the membership of the Conservative Party as far as elected representatives not all but a lot of them are cowards and they're afraid to speak out and unfortunately the membership has to accept a party that wants to give corporate welfare to General Motors corporate welfare to Bambara J wants to protect the cartel like Supply Management they want to endanger things like NAFTA so if you're a small government free-market conservative it doesn't leave you with a lot of places to call a home with the three old line parties and so it might be time to start looking at creating a new party if on a policy front there's nowhere to call home you know I I understand your point but I hope that there are enough conservative members from within and maybe some conservative party MPs that are emboldened enough to listen to the grassroots to make some change and I want to thank you so much for taking the time to discuss supply management with me today thank you very much I appreciate that
