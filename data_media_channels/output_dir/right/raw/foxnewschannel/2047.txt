AS THE REPUBLICANS TRY TO HOLD

9
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:19,526
ON TO THE MAJORITIES IN

10
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:20,060
CONGRESS.

11
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,262
JOINING ME NOW, CHRIS

12
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:25,832
STIREWALT, EDITOR OF "HALFTIME

13
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:26,199
REPORT."

14
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,168
SIX DAYS AGO FOX NEWS HOSTED A

15
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:29,202
DEBATE IN WEST VIRGINIA FOR

16
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:31,905
THE REPUBLICANS TWO ARE VYING

17
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:33,039
TO TAKE ON JOE MANCHIN, THE

18
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,575
DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT SENATOR.

19
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:37,143
AND TELL ME ABOUT WHAT HAS

20
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:37,977
HAPPENED SINCE THEN.

21
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:39,479
ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS MORNING

22
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,914
WE GET A TWEET FROM PRESIDENT

23
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:41,848
TRUMP THAT SAYS TO THE GREAT

24
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:43,550
PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA, WE

25
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,884
HAVE TOGETHER A REALLY GREAT

26
00:00:44,884 --> 00:00:46,553
CHANCE TO KEEP MAKING A BIG

27
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:47,354
DIFFERENCE.

28
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:48,621
THE PROBLEM IS DON BLANKENSHIP

29
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:50,056
CURRENTLY RUNNING FOR SENATE

30
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:51,558
CAN'T WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION

31
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:53,259
IN YOUR STATE.

32
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,261
NO WAY.

33
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:56,463
REMEMBER ALABAMA.

34
00:00:56,463 --> 00:00:58,298
VOTE REPRESENTATIVE JENKINS OR

35
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:02,802
ATTORNEY GENERAL MORRISEY!"

36
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:04,904
HE WEIGHED IN.

37
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:06,639
>> HE HALFWAY DID.

38
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:08,007
I WAS CAUSED TO THINK ABOUT

39
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:09,342
WHAT PEOPLE LIKE ROMNEY AND SO

40
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:10,844
MANY OTHERS DID WITH TRUMP IN

41
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:11,911
2016 WHEN THEY SAID WHATEVER

42
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,947
YOU DO, DON'T VOTE FOR THIS

43
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:14,280
GUY.

44
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,482
FOR WHOM SHOULD WE VOTE?

45
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:16,149
I DON'T CARE.

46
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:17,050
JUST NOT HIM.

47
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,952
YOU KNOW HOW THAT WORKED OUT.

48
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:19,519
>> Dana: MM-HMM.

49
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,553
>> IF THE PRESIDENT WAS

50
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:22,555
SERIOUS ABOUT WANTING TO STOP

51
00:01:22,555 --> 00:01:23,423
BLANKENSHIP HE PROBABLY SHOULD

52
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:24,724
HAVE PICKED, RIGHT?

53
00:01:24,724 --> 00:01:25,792
HE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SAID.

54
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,227
HE KNEW HE DIDN'T WANT TO PICK

55
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:29,262
BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH FLAWED

56
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:31,564
IN THEIR OWN WAYS.

57
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:33,767
JENKINS IS PROBABLY A BETTER

58
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:35,769
GENERAL ELECTION CANDIDATE

59
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:39,272
THAT MORRISEY BUT HE IS MORE

60
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:39,906
ESTABLISHMENTARIAN FIGURE

61
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:41,007
WHICH WOULD UPSET FOLKS.

62
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:44,144
MORRISEY LOOKING LIKE HE HAS A

63
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:45,712
TOUGHER POLL AGAINST JENKINS

64
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:46,546
AGAINST MANCHIN.

65
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:48,181
DIFFICULT CHOICE SO HE IS

66
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:49,449
CHOSE NOT TO CHOOSE.

67
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:50,517
AS A CONSEQUENCE BLANKENSHIP

68
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:52,051
IS PROBABLY HELPED IN THAT IF

69
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:53,553
THE SUPPORT DRIVES OFF IN BOTH

70
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:55,455
DIRECTIONS AND BLANKENSHIP CAN

71
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:56,723
KEEP HIS SOLID CORE, MAYBE HE

72
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:58,625
CAN PULL IT OFF.

73
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,759
>> Dana: THEN WHAT, YOU

74
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,861
KNOW, THE PRESIDENT SAYS,

75
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:03,163
"REMEMBER ALABAMA."

76
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:04,764
CERTAINLY, BLANKENSHIP MIGHT

77
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:05,398
REMEMBER ALABAMA.

78
00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:06,466
AND THAT ROY MOORE WAS

79
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,901
EXPECTED NOT TO BE ABLE TO WIN

80
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:08,668
THAT PRIMARY.

81
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:09,869
OR THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE

82
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,540
WANTED HIM NOT TO, BUT HE DID

83
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:13,973
ANYWAY.

84
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:15,208
PRESIDENT IN A CONTROVERSIAL

85
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,509
MOVE WE HAVE ALL TALKED ABOUT

86
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,545
FOR A LONG TIME ENDORSES ROY

87
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:18,945
MOORE.

88
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:20,313
AND ROY MOORE ENDS UP LOSING.

89
00:02:20,313 --> 00:02:21,414
SO THE PRESIDENT COULD CHANGE

90
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:23,049
HIS MIND AND PERHAPS PEOPLE

91
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:26,319
THAT SUPPORT BLANKENSHIP WHO

92
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,220
WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO GO

93
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,354
IN THERE AND FIRE UP

94
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:28,755
WASHINGTON.

95
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:29,856
MAY REALIZE THE PRESIDENT WILL

96
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:31,424
COME AROUND IF HE HAS TO.

97
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:32,358
>> I'M SURE HE WOULD.

98
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:34,360
I'M SURE IF THEY NOMINATED

99
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,361
BLANKENSHIP THAT THE

100
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:36,229
REPUBLICANS -- LOOK, IF THE

101
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:37,864
REPUBLICANS COULD GET BEHIND

102
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:39,566
SOMEBODY WHO WAS CREDIBLY

103
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:41,034
ACCUSED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS

104
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:43,136
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT TOWARD

105
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:44,971
TEENAGER GIRLS I ASSUME THEY

106
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:46,272
COULD FIND IT WITHIN

107
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:47,474
THEMSELVES TO COME AROUND FOR

108
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:49,976
A FELLOW WHO WAS CONVICTED OF

109
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:52,178
WHITE COLLAR CRIMES.

110
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:53,980
THOUGH THEY WERE CONNECTED

111
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,148
ULTIMATELY TO VERY TRAGIC

112
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:55,515
INCIDENT.

113
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:57,083
I SUPPOSE IF THEY COME AROUND

114
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,219
FOR ROY MOORE THEY COULD COME

115
00:02:59,219 --> 00:02:59,819
AROUND FOR BLANKENSHIP.

116
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,621
THE OTHER THING HERE, THIS IS

117
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:02,455
UNFAIR COMPARISON.

118
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:03,623
BLANKENSHIP IS NOT ROY MOORE.

119
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:04,257
>> Dana: RIGHT.

120
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:05,291
>> ROY MOORE COULDN'T WIN AS

121
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,826
IT TURNS OUT THE ALABAMA

122
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:08,661
GENERAL ELECTION.

123
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:10,296
THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK

124
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:11,865
DON BLANKENSHIP WOULD DO

125
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:12,832
SUBSTANTIALLY WORSE THAN

126
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:14,067
EITHER OF THE OTHER TWO.

127
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,502
I DON'T THINK EITHER OF THE

128
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:17,637
OTHER TWO MADE A CONCLUSIVE

129
00:03:17,637 --> 00:03:18,705
CASE THEY ARE THE BEST NOMINEE

130
00:03:18,705 --> 00:03:19,506
FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION.

131
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:20,874
I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE HERE

132
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:22,509
IS OVERCOOKING THE BROTH A

133
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:22,909
LITTLE BIT.

134
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,210
MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF TO

135
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,979
LET IT PLAY OUT ON ITS OWN.

136
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:26,646
>> Dana: TAKE US TO NORTH

137
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:27,013
CAROLINA.

138
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:31,684
I WANT TO READ YOU A QUOTE

139
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:33,520
FROM STEVE BANNON.

140
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,721
HE IS SAYING ABOUT THE

141
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:35,822
MID-TERM ELECTIONS YOU HAVE TO

142
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:37,924
MAKE IT UP OR DOWN VOTE

143
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:38,324
NOVEMBER 6.

144
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:39,392
YOU WANT TRUMP ON THE TICKET

145
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,393
IN EVERY DISTRICT.

146
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:41,628
YOU HAVE TO PUT TRUMP ON THE

147
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:42,061
TICKET.

148
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:43,763
YOU ARE NOT VOTING FOR

149
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:44,130
CONGRESS.

150
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,665
YOU ARE VOTING FOR DONALD

151
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:45,999
TRUMP.

152
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,867
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

153
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:48,968
PRESIDENTS IN FIRST MIDTERM

154
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:50,370
TRY TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES TO

155
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,205
SAY THIS IS NOT A REFERENDUM

156
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:52,705
ON THE PRESIDENT.

157
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:54,240
THIS IS A REFERENDUM ON

158
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,774
CONGRESS.

159
00:03:54,774 --> 00:03:56,409
BUT BANNON IS SUGGESTING THE

160
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,010
EXACT OPPOSITE.

161
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,479
GOOD STRATEGY OR NO?

162
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,115
>> I ASSUME COMMENTS LIKE THAT

163
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:03,349
IS WHY STEVE BANNON IS MAKING

164
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,952
THE PHONE CALL FROM AN INDIES

165
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:07,687
CLOSED LOCATION -- UNDISCLOSED

166
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:09,756
LOCATION DEEP IN THE POLITICAL

167
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:10,156
WILDERNESS.

168
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,758
YOU CAN'T TRUMP THE DECIDING

169
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:12,659
ISSUE IN EVERY RACE.

170
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:13,493
SOME DISTRICTS THE REPUBLICANS

171
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:14,561
DO WANT TO MAKE IT ABOUT

172
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:14,894
TRUMP.

173
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:17,262
IF YOU ARE IN WEST VIRGINIA

174
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:18,164
WHERE THE PRESIDENT PROBABLY

175
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:20,033
HAS 70% JOB APPROVAL RATING

176
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,567
YOU WANT A REFERENDUM ON

177
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:21,935
TRUMP.

178
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:23,436
BUT A LOT OF THE DISTRICTS,

179
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:25,371
PARTICULARLIES THE DOZENS OF

180
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:26,306
DISTRICTS WHERE THE PRESIDENT

181
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:27,941
IS NOT PARTICULARLY POPULAR

182
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:28,741
AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE

183
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:29,909
FIGHTING CONTROL OF THE HOUSE,

184
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:31,144
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT TAX

185
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:31,511
CUTS.

186
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:32,679
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT

187
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:33,046
ISSUES.

188
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:34,547
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THOSE

189
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:35,081
THINGS.

190
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,783
THEY DON'T WANT IT TO BE A

191
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:37,417
REFERENDUM ON TRUMP.

192
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,619
