44
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,910

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,400
her because if I want to straighten it I

46
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,220
can or if I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a compact</font>

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,790

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,989
was surprised that it really wasn't that

57
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,860
short I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I underestimated how</font>

58
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,739
fast my hair could grow but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I catch</font>

59
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,569
my attention for like almost a year

60
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:22,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 months I realized it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was time to quit</font>

61
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,900
relax in my hair when I relaxed that it

62
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,560

65
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,280
just too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much of a hassle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Olin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

66
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,280
I didn't see any hair grow and I started

67
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,859
seeing her grow when I had braids when I

68
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,239

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,849
liked it really works it's not like it's

83
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:22,160
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an oil base it's like a cream and</font>

recommended by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eve wouldn't say that</font>

91
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,610
being natural is easier than being

92
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,919
relaxed because it does take a lot of

93
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,319
upkeep<font color="#E5E5E5"> right out the fact that I can</font>

94
