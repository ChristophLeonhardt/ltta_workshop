00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:18,249
NOVEMBER 7 AND THE DEMOCRATS HAD

18
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,183
GAINED CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF

KAVANAUGH.

24
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:31,896
>> IT WAS HEARTBREAKING, BUT I

25
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:34,565
THINK WOMEN ARE NOT GOING TO

26
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,334
RECEDE, WOMEN ARE GOING TO

27
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:38,435
CONTINUE TO CONFRONT WHAT TOOK

28
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:39,203
PLACE IN THAT CONFIRMATION.

29
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:41,038
AND HIM.

30
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,473
AND HE WON'T REST EASY IN HIS

31
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:44,074
JOB.

32
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:46,577

34
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:50,781
HE WON'T REST EASY?

35
00:00:50,782 --> 00:00:53,617
SOUNDS LIKE AN IMPLICIT THREAT.

36
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:55,186
OR DOES SHE MEAN IMPEACHMENT?

37
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:56,654
THE JUSTICE IS GOING TO BE

38
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:58,322
CONFRONTED IN HIS HOME AND

39
00:00:58,323 --> 00:00:59,857
PUBLIC LIFE, PUBLIC PLACES?

40
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:01,692
IS IT SOME KIND OF DOG WHISTLE

41
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:03,260
TO GO AFTER KAVANAUGH?

42
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,596
SIMILAR TO HER EARLIER CALL TO

COMMITTEE.

53
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,117
SHE FACED THREE ETHICS

54
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:28,919
VIOLATIONS FOR SETTING UP A

55
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,455

SHE KEEPS ON MAKING THREATS.

60
00:01:37,996 --> 00:01:40,431
>> I'M GOING TO KEEP SAYING THAT

61
00:01:40,432 --> 00:01:42,366
WE NEED TO IMPEACH HIM.

62
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:46,470
JOIN WITH ME, LET'S IMPEACH 45!

63
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:50,107
IF HE THINKS HE CAN STOP ME,

00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:52,343
FROM TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHING

65
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:53,010
45, HE HAS ANOTHER THOUGHT

66
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,111

I ALWAYS WANT TO AVOID IT.

71
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:06,557
AND THIS IS ANOTHER MAN WHO

72
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:08,259
SHARES MAXINE'S IMPEACHMENT

73
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,158
FANTASY.

74
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,930
IF THE DEMOCRATS SWEEP TO POWER,

75
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:13,897
JERRY NADLER WOULD BECOME

76
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:15,199

00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,276
PERJURY AND OTHER THINGS THAT

INTO BEFORE.

85
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:30,314
IF HE IS ON THE SUPREME COURT,

86
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:32,216
AND THE SENATE HASN'T

87
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:32,916
INVESTIGATED, THEN THE HOUSE

88
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:34,351

MILLIONS AND ACHIEVE ZIPPO.

139
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:15,419
THEY WOULD SERVE THE DEMOCRATS'

SOCIAL PROGRAM SHE DIDN'T LIKE.

165
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:00,798
