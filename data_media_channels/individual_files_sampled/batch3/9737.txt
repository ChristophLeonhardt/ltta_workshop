THERE'S LOTS OF THEM. TRACE GALLAGHER HAS THEM. HI, TRACE. HI, SHEP. THERE WERE LOTS OF ADS SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP AND BERNIE SANDERS AND NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS THEM SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON. IT APPEARS THE GOAL WAS TO STIR UP RACIAL AND POLITICAL DIVISIONS. MOST OF THE ADS WERE ISSUED BASED LIKE IMMIGRATION AND GUN CONTROL. THANKS TO FACEBOOK'S TARGETING TOOLS, THE RUSSIANS WERE ABLE TO DELIVER PHONY INFORMATION TO SPECIFIC GROUPS, WHITE, BLACK, HISPANIC, LGBTQ, EVEN VIEWERS THAT WATCH FOX NEWS OR MSNBC. AND THE NEXT WAS TO ENTICE VOTERS TO WATCHING ADDING AND GETTING REAL TIME FEEDBACK. LIKE A BORN LIBERAL AD THAT GOT 50,000 VIEWS AND SHARED. THIS MAKE BELIEVE AD FOR A MADE-UP BLACK ACTIVIST GROUP GOT 10,000 HITS. OTHER ADS GET A FEW LIKES OR VIEWS. THE POPULAR ADS MAYBE THEIR WAY INTO FACEBOOK NEWS FEEDS AND GOT MORE EXPOSURE. THE UNSUCCESSFUL ADS WERE TAKEN DOWN, SHEP. Shepard: AS LONG AS THEY HAVE THE TARGETING TOOLS, HOW CAN YOU STOP THIS? IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH. SOME OF THE ADS WERE BOUGHT AFTER THE ELECTION AND WELL INTO 2017 CAUSING SOME LAWMAKERS TO BELIEVE THE RUSSIANS MIGHT STILL BE AT IT. TODAY FACEBOOK RELEASED A STATEMENT READING THIS WILL NEVER BE A SOLVED PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'RE UP AGAINST DETERMINED CREATIVE AROUND WELL-FUNDED ADVERSARIES, BUT WE'RE MAKING STEADY PROGRESS. ON THAT NOTE, FACEBOOK HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF OVERSIGHT MEASURES. IN HINDSIGHT, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE ADS WERE DEAD GIVE-AWAY AND THEY WERE BOUGHT WITH RUBLES AND THE LANGUAGE WAS POOR. ONE AD SAID THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE PROVED TO DESERVE TO STAY IN THE AD. A PRO BLACK LIVES MATTER. NOT THE BEST CONTEXT. LAWMAKERS PUT THIS INFORMATION OUT THERE SO WE CAN SEE IT AND HOPEFULLY DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF GUARDING OURSELVES THE NEXT
