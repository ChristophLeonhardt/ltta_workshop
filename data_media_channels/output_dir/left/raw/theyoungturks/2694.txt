1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,759
SO WE TOLD YOU HERE ON THE YOUNG
TURKS THAT THE TAX BILL WAS FOR

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,250
THE RICH AND FOR LARGE
CORPORATIONS.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:16,160
84% OF THE BENEFITS WENT
TO THE TOP 4%.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,770
BUT THE POWERFUL WHO GIVE
DONATIONS TO POLITICIANS.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,300
LET'S MAKE IT DOUBLY CLEAR.

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:34,900
THEY TALK ABOUT THE CORRUPTION
BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF THAT.

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,850
BUYING OTHERS SEE THE ADS WORK
FOR THE KOCH BROTHERS AND THE

8
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,579
MERCERS.

9
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,640
SO WHAT WILL THEY DO?

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:56,809
JUST TO THEIR CORRUPTION
OUT 

11
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:59,750
IN THE OPEN.

12
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:10,200
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,900
IBTIMES REPORTS.

14
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:26,250
I LIKE HOW THEY
DIDN'T BOTHER WAITING.

15
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,690
I'M SORRY HERE IN AMERICA WE
HAVE LEGALIZED BRIBES SO NONE

16
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,939
OF THIS IS ILLEGAL.

17
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:42,729
THE KOCH BROTHERS CAN GIVEAS
MUCH AS THEY WANT.

18
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:49,280
BUT THIS THEY WANT TO RUB IN
YOUR FACE A LITTLE BIT.

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:02:02,079
WE ARE NOT ANYWHERE NEAR DONE
WITH THIS STORY.

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,348
LET'S GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS.

21
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:22,569
IN THE PAUL RYAN PACK ALSO GIVES
MONEY TO POLITICIANS AS WELL.

22
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:24,370
WHAT DO THE KOCH BROTHERS WANT?

23
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,890
THE TWO BROTHERS HAVE A COMBINED
$100 BILLION.

24
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,280
IF ALL THEY DID WAS RECEIVE 1% 単

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,400
ON CORPORATE TAXES ALONE IT
IS A GIANT SAVINGS.

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,310
THEN YOU HAVE YOUR INCOME TAX
AND THE PASS-THROUGHS.

27
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,930
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE
ESTATE TAX.

28
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,870
SO $500,000 TO BUY PAUL RYAN IS
LIKE NOTHING TO THEM.

29
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,170
THIS IS HOW THEY BUY ALL THE
POLITICIANS.

30
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,170
IT IS GROSS.

31
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,760
GET ALL THE MONEY OUT.

32
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
WOLF 単 PAC.COM.

33
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,030
NONPARTISAN, GET THE LEFT WING
YOUNG MONEY OUT, THE RIGHT

34
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,129
WING MONEY OUT, ALL OF IT.

35
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:59,850
IF WE ALLOW PRIVATE FINANCING
THEY WILL WORK FOR PRIVATE

36
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,850
INTERESTS.

37
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,000
DO PUBLIC FINANCING SO THEY WORK
FOR PUBLIC INTERESTS.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
BROTHERS
ARE?

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
OIL AND GAS INVESTING.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,319
DO YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE MAIN
LINES OF WORK FOR THE KOCH THEY

41
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,680
ARE LAUGHING AT YOU.

42
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,750
WE ARE NOT DONE.

43
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,250
THERE'S A LOT MORE WHERE THAT
CAME FROM, ALL THE RICH

44
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,250
FAMILIES.

45
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:33,840
THE FIRST TIME THAT A
BILLIONAIRE OR CORPORATION GIVES

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:04:35,389
MONEY TO A POLITICIAN YOU CAN
STAY THEY COULD JUST TAKE

47
00:04:35,389 --> 00:05:07,180
THEIR MONEY AND VOTE
THE 

48
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:17,669
OTHER WAY.

49
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:23,270
THE SECOND TIME IT CORPORATION
GIVES MONEY TO A POLITICIAN,

50
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,629
THAT MEANS THEY GOT A GOOD
RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

51
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,689
THAT MEANS THAT GUY IS NOW
WORKING FOR US.

52
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:31,729
GIVE HIM MORE MONEY SO HE GIVES
US BILLIONS IN RETURN.

53
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:34,350
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT
PAUL RYAN IS.

54
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:42,689
HE IS A PATHETIC ERRAND
BOY FOR THE RICH.

55
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:56,740
SORRY FOR THE TERRIBLE
PRONUNCIATION THERE.

56
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:13,569
SO THE BROTHERS AT LEAST WAITED
13 DAYS.

57
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:20,840
THE MEDIA NEVER REPORTS ON
THIS IN ITS ENTIRETY.

58
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:35,300
ALSO YOU TO 
THE MONEY AS IF IT

59
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,080
IS SOMETHING GOOD.

60
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,990
PAUL RYAN IS DOING TERRIBLY AND
GOT BRIBED $5 MILLION.

61
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,479
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE QUARTERED
THE MARKET ON THIS CORRUPTION.

62
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,500
TALK ABOUT A RIGGED SYSTEM 単 ONE
MORE LITTLE THING TO RUB IT IN.

63
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,649
HE SAYS UNDOUBTEDLY WITH A SMILE
ON HIS FACE, SMALL BUSINESS

64
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:52,649
OWNERS 単

65
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:55,149
KOCH INDUSTRIES IS THE LARGEST
PRIVATE INDUSTRY THERE IS.

66
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,959
CHARLES AND DAVID KOCH JUST TWO
PEOPLE HAVE $100 BILLION.

67
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,400
WHAT SMALL BUSINESS ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

68
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,240
LET'S GO TO THE PROPAGANDA REAL
QUICK.

69
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,910
THEY SPENT ALL THIS MONEY TO
EDUCATE THE MASSES.

70
00:07:05,910 --> 00:09:21,529
BUT THEY CAN JUST RELY ON NOT
ONLY BUYING TELEVISION ADS BUT

71
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:26,430
THROUGH THOSE ADS GETTING THE
HOST TO SHUT UP.

72
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:39,560
THEY USED TO HAVE A LOCKDOWN
ON THAT STUFF AND THE USE TO

73
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:48,380
BE FRUSTRATED.

74
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,529
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HATE THIS
BILL SO WHAT DO THEY NEED?

75
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:59,490
MORE EDUCATION IN OTHER WORDS
BRAINWASHING.

76
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:18,620
LOT OF TIME 
THEY 

77
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,050
TAKE THOSE
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND THEY

78
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,020
BUY MORE AND MORE ADS.

79
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,490
THEY KNOW THAT OVER 80% OF THE
BENEFITS ARE GOING TO THE TOP

80
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,180
1%.

81
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:38,579
THE 
REPUBLICANS HAVE THEIR BEST

82
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:39,850
INTEREST IN MIND.

83
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,670
THAT IS HOW THIS GAME IS PLAYED
AND THAT IS HOW THEY RIP ALL

84
00:10:43,670 --> 00:00:00,000
OF US OFF.
