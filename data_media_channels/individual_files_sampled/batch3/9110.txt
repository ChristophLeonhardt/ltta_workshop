Greg: TUESDAY, 18 REPUBLICAN HOUSE MEMBERS NOMINATED TRUMP FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE. SHOULD TRUMP SHARE THE AWARD IF INDEED HE WINS? WE HEAR ABOUT KIM, PRESIDENT XI, MOON. WHAT ABOUT THE WORM? DENNIS RODMAN CLAIMS KIM JONG UN DIDN'T UNDERSTAND TRUMP UNTIL RODMAN GAVE HIM "THE ART OF THE DEAL" LAST YEAR. THE BOOK LED TO A CHANGE OF HEART. I THINK HIS IMPRESSION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. Greg: TRUMP IS GOING TO MEET WITH KIM AND MAY BE AMERICAN HOSTAGES MIGHT BE RELEASED. IT'S PRETTY AMAZING NEWS. WE WENT TO CNN AND MSNBC FOR RESPONSE. NO, PLEASE. PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT. Greg: THEY HATE ANY GOOD NEWS ABOUT TRUMP. RODMAN MAY BE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S MOST SUCCESSFUL DIPLOMAT. MAKES YOU WONDER, SHOULD OBAMA HAVE SENT PEYTON MANNING TO TALK TO PUTIN? ALEX RODRIGUEZ TO CHINA, JOHNNY MANDEL TO TEHRAN? ANYTHING COULD'VE WORKED. AS LONG AS THEY HAD A COPY OF THE BOOK. THEY WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER THAN HILLARY AND SAMANTHA POWER. AS FAR AS THOSE THREE HOSTAGES, WHO IS A BETTER NEGOTIATOR? OBAMA AND HILLARY OR TRUMP AND RODMAN. WE ALL KNOW I HAVE AS MUCH CHANCE OF WINNING THAT AS TRUMP DOES. THE EXACT QUALITIES THAT TURN OFF LARS IN OSLO. NO MATTER WHAT, TRUMP AND RODMAN HAS GOTTEN US FURTHER WITH THE NUCLEAR THREAT THAN ALL OF THE BELTWAY DABBLERS OUT THERE. MAYBE THEY SHOULD READ THE BOOK TOO. DANA, YOU ARE AT THE TABLE WHEN I CALLED DENNIS RODMAN A LITTLE B WORD BECAUSE HE WENT TO NORTH KOREA. MY MEA CULPA. I THINK I WAS WRONG, AND I SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO DENNIS RODMAN. HE'S AN AMERICAN HERO. Dana: I THINK YOU SHOULD RESERVE YOUR JUDGMENT. I WONDER HOW JOHN KERRY ESCAPED THE MONOLOGUE. Greg: HE MOVES VERY SLOW. HE BLENDED INTO THE WOODEN BACKGROUND THAT I DIDN'T SEE HIM BACKGROUND THAT I DIDN'T SEE HI HIM. Dana: WHO DID HE TAKE ON? JAMES TAYLOR TO PARIS. Greg: AMERICA WAS HAPPY BECAUSE JAMES TAYLOR WAS NOT IN THE COUNTRY FOR A FEW DAYS. Dana: I THINK IF IN THE LONG RUN WE ACTUALLY DO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION HERE, WHICH THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO, THEN OF COURSE PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD BE GRANTED, WARDEN, EXCUSE ME. THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. I ALSO THINK ONE OF THE BIG THINGS AND THE REASON I DON'T THINK DENNIS RODMAN DESERVE SO MUCH CREDIT IS THE STRATEGIC PLAN TO SQUEEZE CHINA AND GET CHINA TO GET LITTLE ROCKET MAN TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THAT'S THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS WHOLE PLAN. Greg: WHO STARTED THAT, KIMBERLY? A MAN NAMED DONALD TRUMP. Kimberly: THE ART OF THE DEAL. FOLLOWING THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT, DENMAN THIS DENNIS RODMAN WAS ABLE TO CHANGE THE MIND-SET OF KIM JONG UN. OPEN TO THE CHARMS OF POTUS AND HE THEREFORE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GOING TO STOP BEING A BAD ACTOR AND I'M GOING TO GET IT TOGETHER. AND I'M GOING TO SHAKE HANDS AND WORK WITH SOUTH KOREA, AND I'M GOING TO RELEASE HOSTAGES, AND I'M GOING TO STOP RUNNING AROUND BEING LITTLE ROCKET MAN. Greg: I WAS THINKING, JUAN, YOU SHOULD GO TO IRAN WITH MY BOOK AND I THINK THAT WOULD SOLVE EVERYTHING. Jesse: MIGHT NOT EVER COME BACK. IS THAT YOUR IDEA? Greg: IT IS A WIN-WIN EITHER WAY. Juan: OH, MY GOD. IT COULD WORK. ANYTHING FOR GREG, YOU KNOW THAT ANYTHING FOR GREG, YOU KNOW THA THAT. Jesse: ANOTHER HOSTAGES WERE GOING TO HAVE TO GET. Dana: WE WILL GET RIGHT ON IT. Juan: JESSE CAN BE MY SEAL. Jesse: YOU ARE NEVER GETTING OUT THEN. Juan: STRUCK BY DENNIS RODMAN. I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL. I THINK YOU ARE HAVING FUN. Kimberly: HE IS SERIOUS. Juan: WHAT YOU SAID IS SERIOUS, KIMBERLY. Greg: WE TALK ABOUT HOW BOOK CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE. Dana: WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THE BOOK AND NOW? HE ACTUALLY GOT NUCLEAR WEAPONS. Greg: WELL, THAT IS THE ART OF THE DEAL. NEGOTIATION. THE ART OF THE DEAL IS RIGHT UP THERE. A FEW YEARS AGO YOU WOULD'VE SAID DONALD TRUMP AND DENNIS RODMAN, WITH THE SUPPORT OF KANYE WEST, WERE ENDING THE KOREAN WAR, I WOULD'VE DROPPED DEAD. IT'S INCREDIBLE. Kimberly: CHECK YOUR PULSE. Jesse: THE MIDDLE EAST, SEND RODMAN. MAYBE THEY CAN SHARE THE PEACE PRIZE. EVERYTHING IS HAPPENING FOR A REASON. Greg: ON A SERIOUS POINT, WE HEAR OF THE IMMINENT RELEASE OF THESE HOSTAGES. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? MIKE POMPEO WHEN HE WAS THERE AND HE MET WITH KIM JONG UN, IT WAS PROBABLY A CONDITION, AND ALSO JOHN BOLTON, THE NEW NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR. WE ARE NOT REMEMBER BOWE BERGDAHL AND THE TRADE? NOT A GOOD TRADE. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS ADMINISTRATION. THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD BE WILLING TO MEET WITH SOMEBODY WHO WAS HOLDING AMERICANS HOSTAGE IN A LABOR CAMP. IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN, THEY HAVE TO BE RELEASED. TWO OF THEM WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE IN 2017, ONE BEFORE THAT, I THINK 2015. APPARENTLY THEY ARE AT A HOTEL NOW. THEY HAVE BEEN MOVED FROM THE CAMP TO A HOTEL. WHEN WE MEET THEM. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING AND IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE YEARS TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION. IMAGINE WHAT WE MIGHT LEARN FROM THEM ABOUT HOW KIM JONG UN ACTUALLY WORKS. I WANT TO TAP THE BRAKES ON THIS IDEA THAT KIM JONG UN SHOULD SHARE IN A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. HE'S A HORRIBLE PIECE IN. Juan: WE HAD RELEASES IN '09 WITH BILL CLINTON AND UP ' '10. THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE AT STATE AND OTHERS SAY, IT'S PART OF HIS BEHAVIOR. THIS IS HOW HE PLAYS THE GAME. HE MAKES OFFERS. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT OUR STRATEGY IS, GOING IN. I SEE SOME PEOPLE WANT TO CELEBRATE EARLY.
