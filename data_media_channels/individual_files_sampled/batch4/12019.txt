so the Democrats obviously have their priorities straight while Democrats spent the night jabbering about abortion and $15 minimum wage and climate change jihadists stormed into a church in Santa Fe on to prove Rae in Normandy France and proceeded to behead an 86 year old priest while shouting Jesus lives just joking they were yelling out with Akbar but you probably knew that this is the fifth jihadist attack in Europe in 11 days so how many times the Democrats mentioned Isis last night yesterday there are 61 speakers 0 times that's right 61 speakers 0 mentions for Isis but the Democrats did find time to put an illegal immigrant on stage also in irritating a comic actress who uses her spare time to auction sanitary napkins Sarah Silverman they also found time to take down offensive Mississippi State flags and wave Palestinian ones on the floor of the convention they found time for another actress who claimed that the border crossed her family and a video from JJ Abrams about that queen of mystery and light Hillary Clinton the Democrats know their priorities defeating Isis isn't one of them they're too busy cheering lustily for a 74 year old loon bag preaching discredited evils responsible for the murder of a hundred million people in the 20th century to worry about another evil murdering priests in Normandy fireworks Watchers and nice gay nightclub goers in Orlando and children in Jerusalem sure it was just night one of the convention but to disconnect on the issue kind of says volumes Republicans worry about terrorism and crime Democrats worry about whether men who think they're ladies can go peepee next to the women last week the media complained that Donald Trump's RNC convention speech was to quote-unquote dark perhaps it was dark because the Democrats have created a rather dark world for us to occupy even as they blindly refused to acknowledge it I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show to demonize people who don't care about your feelings so

so frame bridge calm again promo code Ben okay so lots going on in the world none of it good for Hillary Clinton so the big disconnect last night was that Hillary Clinton's convention is off to a crap start I mean it is just a garbaggio it's it's it's a mess it's a disaster area and it's a disaster area in the best possible way meaning the way that makes me laugh and we need a little bit of laugh stirring selection somebody said the other day they can't wait for the election to be over except that then Obama at least you won't be president anymore but then one of these other two people will be so we just have to enjoy the circus well at last at least that's fun so yesterday at the convention Hillary's named the Bernie Sanders supporters are super ticked off and they have a reason to be super ticked the Democratic National Convention basically the committee rigged the the primaries for Hillary Clinton they were on Hillary side the whole time they're pushing out narratives against Bernie Sanders from the DNC which they're not supposed to be doing and so the Bernie Sanders supporters were understandably pretty ticked here is Hillary's name being mentioned at the convention and here's what it looked like yesterday and we have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine gets boom this is awkward where is my pudding brothers and sisters brothers and sisters this is this is the real world that we live in this is the real world that we live in they're going wait Bernie you've been telling us we live in the fantasy of the unicorns ask for the last several years so what are you talking about the real world you just told us we got free college and free health care and free everything because unicorns fart gold and now you're telling me that this is the real world and I have to back Hillary claims it yes unicorns do Farkle but you also must vote for Lady Godiva top that unicorn Hillary Clinton okay so he gets booed Bernie Sanders gets booed by the Bernese people then Stinney Hoyer who's the House Minority Whip he gets booed he says we're here to nominate Hillary and things go wildly wrong he's on the floor of the convention we're here to nominate Hillary Clinton because of her he gets because because of her ability her experience and her vision I'm gonna yell at you now for our country we're gonna nominate Hillary Clinton because if I don't come out here nominate her I'll be found in Fort Marcy Park with a hole in my face okay so little Vince Foster humor there for you he wasn't actually murdered gang he committed suicide okay so then they gave the DNC invocation and this is pretty funny so they're invoking it first of all any time God gets invoked at the DNC everybody starts booing because this is a pagan Club so they're not gonna they're not gonna cheer for God obviously I was at the DNC in 2012 when they literally turned God like literally they wanted to put God back into the into the platform and the Democrats have she booted so now the invocation gets booed through as soon as the speaker mentions Hillary's name we have an opportunity Oh God to give undeniable evidence of our commitment to justice and equality by nominating Hillary Rodham Clinton and she gets booze just really trying to find people who are caring and as our candidate for the highest office in the land god you have given us wisdom now give us courage okay the facing of this and they're chanting for me right now look at these guys we've already raised over there and then you got the women chanting Hillary versus Hillary buddy which is the greatest unite us all God in one party mighty name that we pray okay you guys threw me a party a long time ago he has no interest in walking through that door okay so that's not even how great it was so the Bernie bros so you remember after the Republican convention the entire media were saying that it was just awful just awful that Republicans were chanting lock her up about Hillary Clinton just terrible that they were cheering lock er up about Hillary Clinton turns out the Bernie people also want Hillary to go to jail so the Bernie will take two nomination so here is one of the Bernie bros basically wearing a field of burn insurance saying yeah I was chanting lock her up she should be locked up she's a criminal I did not hear chance of lock her up although there have been reports of that did you chant lock her up at that event today well earlier a night in uh the breakfast meeting we did we did chant that a little bit I mean at this point it's that's what she is and that's what the rights gonna do right so we need to get that exposed now is that the super-deluxe understand that the poll numbers are what the poll numbers really are and we don't want Hillary nominate it because we do not want Trump to win and are you gonna watch her speech on Thursday night I don't know we'll see what happens it's gonna be it's definitely gonna hurt the ear so if we do if we do stay on top so you know there's some people that may to be thinking about leaving you can't call them shrill because he's a leftist that's the way this works if you're a leftist you can call Hillary a shrill witch who rides around on a broom if you're a right-wing learned you say that then that means you're a sexist so I love this the Bernie Sanders supporters are openly saying he'll no we're not gonna vote for Hillary Clinton here's a few more of them saying this and they're chanting Elmo's ENC we won't vote for Hillary which is pretty spectacular and by the way that the polls show that a lot of the mone vote for Hillary Clinton at least 10% of the Democrats are talking about not voting for Hillary Clinton and it might be more than that remember 40% of Democrats voted for Bernie Sanders in the primaries and about 30% of those 30% of those rest of a 12% total of the Democratic Party 12% is saying yeah we may not show up and they haven't shown up in the past because Bernie was bringing some new people to the polls so the Bernie Sanders supporters are actually a threat to Hillary Clinton so if you're not noticing the theme here the theme is that the Democratic Party is divided and it is the Republican Party significantly more United around Trump than the Democratic Party is around Hillary Clinton and that's just a description I'm one of the people who's not united behind Trump but I'm just telling you can the amount of pressure that's brought to bear on people like me by not only elites within the party but he leads in this business to back Trump he's extraordinary when it comes to Bernie Sanders they're not getting the same kind of pressure they're not getting the same kind of pressure and so what you're getting instead is this vast gap in the Democratic Party and these Bernie people don't care I mean they can always just go home and smoke pot and if Hillary Clinton you know ends up being the President of the United States they don't lose that much cuz Hillary's gonna be a leftist and if Trump ends up being presidents of the United States and then ou lose that much cuz trump ain't that far right so he's pretty amusing I mean Trump is actually further to the left on trade than Hillary is he mirrors Bernie Sanders his position so it got even it got even better I mean it's just it's better and better it's wonderful here are the delegates cheering the announcement of debbie Wasserman Schultz's resignation she of course resigned yesterday she's the Democratic DNC chairwoman who resigned and then she had to negotiate a flight back to Florida because they said well you don't work for us anymore so we're not gonna pay for your flight and she said pretty please and he said well fine but you have to have a middle seat so here is Bernie Sanders announcing this in his own crowd cheering the ouster of the DNC chairwoman is I think all of you know Debbie wasserman-schultz resigned yesterday her resignation opens up the possibility of new leadership at the top of the Democratic Party that will stand with working people and that will open the doors of the party to those people who want real change okay so it's it's so everybody is is tearing each other apart and you can see this morning apparently there was a there was a shouting match between Bernie and Hillary supporters this is yesterday actually at the start of the DNC a shouting match between the two sides they're yelling at each other in the convention hall he mentioned name tillery's maybe the good news is the solution the good news is Hillary has a solution to all of this she's just gonna have her operatives go around and take away people's signs this was actually happening in the arena yesterday you'll see people holding up Bernie signs and DNC operatives going around and ripping down the signs out of the burning people's hands he's doing he's collecting this guy here is collecting all of the Bernie signs shortly before that he was actually taking them out of people's hands and those people were trying to resist which is pretty amusing and the Bernie Sanders people are right there beside themselves they're absolutely beside themselves so the best thing yesterday of all was the crying Bernie Sanders supporters this equipped 30 there's a there's a the Bernie Sanders supporters are just they've lost their minds I mean they didn't have much of minds to begin with considering they were supporting a socialist loon bag who's eighty-seven thousand years old look at them weeping yeah it's very sad I love you get in the Peter Pan hat he's my personal favorite I love the music tragedy strikes there's a lot of people who are working behind your local counter at the Starbucks who are very very upset about Bernie going down in flames okay so they're they're really really upset about this and then and they've a right to be upset I mean he was gypped and he was he was cheated out of this and everybody knows that he was cheated out of this and so this whole thing is really delicious the Democrats are trying to bring this whole thing together Sarah Silverman who as I mentioned before one of the least funny people in the United States all she does is do things in a cutesy voice and then and then talk about poop and pee and sex and vaginas so Sarah Silverman she goes out there and she does her routine on stage huh god I can't even look at her she's so charming us and she and she says she's a Bernie Sanders supporter and she says the Bernie people are being crazy so I tell you this I will vote for Hillary with gusto as I continue to be inspired and moved to action by the ideals set forth by Bernie who will never stop fighting for us I am proud to be a part of Bernie's movement and a vital part of that movement is making absolutely sure that Hillary Clinton is our next president of the United States yeah city she hours that was pretty good Sara Hilary the birdie can I just say to the Bernie or bust people you're being ridiculous she's so upset and this is okay selling point something out okay so she's she's obviously very upset now what the reason she's upset is not because the the Bernier bus people are being ridiculous she's upset because she's been shamed I choose a leading Bernie supporter and there she is on stage and Bernie Sanders is on stage too and they're both up there doing this routine where now everybody's behind Hillary Clinton and the burning people are making her feel bad about herself you can see it in that clip she feels bad about herself that she's backing Hillary Clinton now she feels like a sellout and she feels like a trainer and she should and she said she feels that way and she feels that she's being that she's betraying her principles by doing it so she has to try and shame everybody on the Bernie side into getting behind Hillary so all this is all this is rolling out it's delicious I want to talk about the media response to this because this just tells you the whole story where the media are because it's truly amazing and there will be Chris Matthews impersonations galore so you'll but you'll have to go to Daley wire.com for because our Facebook live has come unfortunately to a crashing halt so

y'all okay so so every time we play that cube so this is so the media so all this goes down right and it's chaos it's chaos and Democrats feel terrible terrible about themselves and Sarah Silverman doesn't know what to do with herself is she's supposed to auctions he used sanitary napkins for abortion what does she supposed it she did that by the way in Texas is she supposed to what is she what does she do with herself she can't make cutesy poop jokes up there when people are yelling at her it's awesome Saturday haha okay and then here's how the media covered this thing so I wish we had the cue from I wish we had the cue from from peer peer gynt by by Greg the UH with it would be with the nice music they always see with like the the animated picture of the deer eating in a meadow because that's what's going on in the media's head right the da-da-da-da-da because that's so that's what's going on in their heads right now okay so NBC News here is Andrea Mitchell watching all this house right watching this break out into the open here's the Andrea Mitchell saying that everything is just magnificent it's just great passion and purpose at the Democratic National Convention the Knights main speaker Bernie Sanders getting an emotional prolonged ovation moving some of his followers to tears Emeril Sanders closed the night throwing his support to his former adversary it was Michelle Obama we stole the show taking veiled shots at Donald Trump without mentioning his name but for all of the discord in the City of Brotherly Love there was also plenty of celebration sure Paul Simon to Philly favorites boys to men and Eva Longoria but reminding a divided we can stop there so if you didn't watch any of the convention the impression that you would get from this media coverage is that it was just a wild raucous fun events no bad blood everything was just great you know you got that deer eating from a little drinking from a little stream over here and the birds fluttering in the background everything is just spectacular Chris Matthews all right I'm gonna say man it comes a show that's beautiful hey humble it's unbelievable there see anything like this I've never seen anything like this I've seen many things my entire life I've never seen anything quite like this and I've seen so many things I mean I have seen a monkey climb a tree I have seen it at the zoo and let me tell you about this do I love the zoo over one time I almost fell into the pit and Harambee almost dragged me around but it was great but in any case I've seen so many things so many wonderful things let's talk about what happened over the Democratic National Convention we could go I think the most important speech tonight was Bernie Sanders I know they'll be more they'll be the roll call they'll be more rhetoric but I have to tell you I think the Democrats first night may turn out to be more successful than the Republicans last night I thought it had a lot of charm and happiness it had al franken's humor perhaps a bit but too sophisticated for some people but it was brilliant and I just thought the whole night was a sluggish row of wonderful sentiments from the high esteem that the first lady's received to the to the passionate of the progressives to the I had to say good sportsmanship and better of Bernie Sanders he really laid it in there for Hillary Clinton tonight and if his flowers don't fall in that's their call but you can't ask more than what he said tonight so overall for putting things together for what we call in politics fence-mending a 10 strike everybody's running Peter Pan hats at this convention Robin Hood oh thank you ok I thought it was Peter Pan that makes more sense but they do live in Neverland so yeah but I loved that I was it doesn't thrilling I mean it's just so beautiful from beginning to end I feel a thrill going up my leg of the back of my thigh up my buttocks all the way up the top my shoulders around the top of my head back down again through my nose up my larynx throw my intestines and out my butt that's how thrilled I am it was just unbelievable unbelievable in every way thank you Michael Isikoff okay so and then MSNBC goes further they say that what Sarah Silverman said you just watched it right she looks awkward and she doesn't understand why she's there and MSNBC says it was important and significant with Sarah Silverman Zed - the Bernier most people you're being ridiculous Sarah Silverman of the great state of New Hampshire to dismiss her as a comedian speaking to this convention would I think dismiss the potential of a real moment there that was important that was a an important speech and a really important outlet yeah times the way I was greeted and what it meant ours are our friends were watching with us what you think well you know we're waiting for the political heavy hitters Jane was this moment obvious no no that this heavy hitting lineup that's coming later in the evening that could have been the most significant speech of a comedian who works blue said that the Bernie supporter should cut it out that was a significant moment I love Brian Williams sitting there in toning like a serious journalist he had just flown in straight from Iraq after having strafe to column of enemy troops and he sat down and he explained how significant that moment was and then CNN and MSNBC they loved Cory Booker's speech Cory Booker's speech was just magnificent according to CNN CNN loved it it was so great Jake that was a powerful powerful speech of introduction to the American people from all he was on Hillary Clinton's shortlist to be think even though he's not the keynote speaker of this convention Elizabeth Warren is that might as well have been the keynote address that was a crowd-pleaser like no speech I have seen at the convention since a young state senator named Barack Obama in 2004 that was that the hell of a speech it was a long speech delivered with the ton of energy and that last page of it that last five or six paragraphs that was what you call wind up yeah well you know what it was more like instead of like a homerun hit her getting his at-bat that was like batting practice over the fence over the fence over the fence it's reminiscent of the Barack Obama speech in 2004 I mean this is the first one out of the gate that is a really really powerful speech Wow I can't do it I can't I can't do it okay the those be important mention for people who are listening and out watching is because Bill Clinton suddenly appears on screen clapping and kind of staring off into space and I don't know why I'm here but there are some images behind my eyes that are not pg-rated okay so the media obviously they turn this entire night and we don't have to belabor the point the media turn this entire night into it's just a massive win so if you've noticed the first 10 minutes of the show we played all the audio from what actually happened at the convention and then you get the the media and the media oh my god what a beautiful event it was like a wedding it was like a wedding so you watched the first part and it's Kosovo and then the media come back and it's just I mean my goodness it was like they were making beautiful loft one enough it on the convention floor it's it's incredible so that's point number one I want to make the media have an agenda here okay the Republicans demonstrated that they were not unified at the RNC and then Trump made a speech that was very popular that's the story of the RNC the story of the DNC is the DNC chairwoman is fired from her job on day one and thrown out of the place without a plane ticket and the Bernie Sanders people are shouting lock her up about their own nominee and the speakers are yelling at the Bernie Sanders people so what's the coverage the coverage tonight wanted to convention at the Republican convention was floor battles Melania Trump plagiarizes from Michelle Obama the media coverage last night was yeah there was some enthusiasm but nothing really important happened they were booing their nominee yeah something a little important happened last night that has ramifications beyond just the convention that's point number one point number two you keep hearing from the media that the Republicans are just this extreme terribly extreme party my big problem with the Republican Party now is that the Republican Party is not conservative I mean Donald Trump is not conservative they trotted out that I think the raziel mentions of abortion except for maybe Ted Cruz mentioning it once during his speech at the Republican National Convention there's no talk about same-sex marriage there is no talk about about limited government or constitutional Liberty there's a big government convention for the Republicans they tried it out Peter Thiel to say that the the culture wars didn't matter at all the extreme party in America right now is not the Republican Party I mean they're fighting just to remain conservative and relevant the Democratic Party is wildly extreme will show you how extreme they are so here's what happened the the Democrats were doing the pledge of allegiance Dinesh D'Souza was standing outside where they were doing the pledge of allegiance and here is a picture do we have a picture of Dinesh SOTA Nash whose new movie is Hillary's America by the way which you should go see he they they were they printed the text of the of the Pledge of Allegiance and they scrolled it above him right I mean this is during the convention I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation indivisible when they got to under God not there so a bunch of people just skipped under God in the Pledge of Allegiance because this is how it works at the Democratic National Convention then there's Eva Longoria right Eva Longoria who you saw mentioned she speaks it like every DNC now even though she hasn't been relevant since she was hot and Desperate Housewives and now she's starting to look a little bit more dumpy and Eva Longoria she shows up and she speaks but she says she's a ninth generation American but she's not really an American she's really a Mexican and here's what she says Texas used to be part of Mexico now I'm ninth generation American my family never crossed a border the border crossed us still Mexico when Donald Trump calls us criminals and rapists he's insulting American families my father is not a criminal or rapist in fact he's a United States veteran okay we can stop it there so Eva Longoria doing this routine first of all Donald Trump was talking about illegal immigrants he's talking about illegal immigrants and he wasn't talking about all illegal immigrants but this is how extreme they are you've got them using actual La Raza slogans that's a la raza slogan that we never cross the border the border crossed us and usually the next consequent thought in that chain of logic is that it's still Mexican territory right we didn't move the border moved and therefore this really is Mexican territory okay how extreme are they so you have an illegal immigrant speaking at the Democratic National Convention this woman is not in the United States legally her name is Astrid Silva she's 28 years old her brother was born here but she was and she came when she was four and here she is talking about how she deserves to be here even though she's here illegally when I was four years old my mother and I climbed into a raft and we crossed the river to join my father in America in search of a better life all I had was a little doll I grew up like an ordinary girl my dad worked as a landscaper and my mom stayed at home one for my brother and I but while my friends did ordinary things I couldn't because my parents were afraid that someone might discover I was undocumented my family believes no one she's standing on the stage at a Democratic National Convention the president's wife is in the audience okay is she really living in fear of being deported I'm gonna go no there and there is something mildly troubling about having somebody who's actually here in the country illegally speaking on the stage at a major convention she's not a United States citizen does that mean she should never become one no that's not my case the case I'm making is that the Democrats are so extreme they will put an actual illegal immigrant on the stage how extreme it Democrats they've got Bill Clinton is a picture of Bill Clinton with Cecile Richards okay so Bill Clinton is standing easy sitting next to Cecile Richards and he's whispering something to her presumably some sweet nothings but Cecile Richards is the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood okay that organization is responsible for the killing of 300,000 babies a year in the United States and she's in the president's box and that's how it stream the Democrats are so before you talk about how extreme the Republicans are start with the fact that the Democrats have an illegal immigrants on stage have a speaker who gets up there and says that the border crossed us and by the way tonight you know who's speaking tonight who's speaking tonight they have the mothers of the movement where the mothers of the movement I've mentioned this before this is the mothers of Michael Brown is the mothers of Trayvon Martin this is the mothers of Sandra bland as the mothers of Eric garner okay Michael Brown tried to take a gun and murder a cop and he was shot his mother is speaking at the Democratic National Convention and we're having cops murdered all around the country right now and the Democrats first response to that is let's have to the convention members of the black lives matter movement who are responsible for who are responsible for at least incentivization of rioting and we're going to have these mothers come in whose sons were involved in criminal activity like Michael Brown and we're going to and we're going to make them heroes I mean that's that's pretty extreme stuff and again yesterday there are 61 speakers that the Democrats didn't mention Isis one time you can tell what their priorities are okay so now to the actual speeches a little bit so the the Michelle Obama got the biggest plaudits of the night to understand what Michelle Obama did last night first a quick flashback this is Michelle Obama in 2008 okay this is her speaking in 2008 when her hubby was running for president for the first time and here's what she had to say about America back then hope is making a comeback it is making a comeback and let me tell you something for the first time in my adult lifetime I'm proud of my country and not just because Barack is done well but because I think people are hungry for change is the first time in 2008 she's ever been proud as an adult of her country okay clip 25 here's here's Michelle Obama last night because of Hillary Clinton my daughters and all our sons and daughters now take for granted that a woman can be President of the United States this Carini container so don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great that somehow we need to make it bring it again because this right now is the greatest country on Earth Sonny knows about that so let's let's do a thought experiment what changed in the last eight years eight years ago she said that she wasn't she'd is the first time she'd ever been proud of her country now it's the greatest country on Earth don't let anybody anybody even me eight years ago tell you that America isn't a wonderful place what's changed the answer is nothing's changed except her husband was president and she got to live in this Versailles Palace in Washington DC that's all that's changed so one of two things is true either she's the most self-centered person on earth and the end what happens to her is how the country is right she gets to be first lady so the country is great now or alternatively she's out there defending her husband's record and so they have to pretend the country is wonderful because hubby runs it even though hubby's done a terrible terrible job in President Obama's a garbage president like a really garbage president so the media we're all over this oh what a wonderful uplifting optimistic speech it's not gonna help the Democrats that speech the reason it's not gonna help the Democrats is because Americans are not in an optimistic mood we're looking around the world and again this morning an 86 year old priest was beheaded beheaded in the middle of France in Normandy he's been headed by a couple of Isis guys and that's the fifth terrorist attack in Europe in the last 11 days and we're supposed to feel optimistic we're supposed to feel good we're seeing cops who are being shot in massacres in the United States we're supposed to feel good about the state of the country the economy's been basically stagnant for the last seven years we're supposed to feel great about all of this we're supposed to feel really optimistic listen I think America is the greatest country on the face of the earth but I've been saying that forever I'm not I'm not a newbie on this America is the greatest country on the face of the earth in spite of the left's attempts to destroy it is her husband who is saying the country had to be fundamentally transformed and what makes the country the greatest country on earth is the founding principles not Michelle Obama saying that Hillary Clinton's a woman and she can be President America was the greatest country on the planet long before Hillary Clinton was born and will be the greatest country on Earth if counting principles are restored long after Hillary Clinton is gone the idea that but this is how Democrats operate right if we're in charge America's great if Republicans are in are in charge America sucks Democrats are in charge right now in America is great it is a great country but only because of the founding principles and they're running it off the rails that's the reality so she gives this speech and everybody's all happy about it but that just dumb traits that for the Democrats whether America's great or not ISM is a matter of the moment whether America is great or not just depends on who's the president at the time if Clinton's President America's great if Obama's President America's great if George W as President America's terrible okay then Elizabeth Warren gets up there Elizabeth crazy McCann's Warren and she gets up there and she basically gets booed by the crowd because she's because she was supposed to be the stalwart in favor of the socialist principles right she was supposed to be the person ripping on Hillary's corruption and her incestuous relationship with the big banks and Goldman Sachs and instead she gets up there and now she's pumping Hillary pretty hard so here is Elizabeth Warren pumping and Hillary pretty hard when we turn on each other we can't unite to fight back against a rigged system okay she says if we turn on each other we can fight back we can't fight back against a rigged system the rigged system she believes is apparently the economy right the economy's rigged but the system is actually rigged like her DNC was actually rigged for Bernie against Bernie Sanders for Hillary Clinton so this bit this carries no weight and the crowd knows that it carries no weight so she keeps speaking and a certain point the crowd starts chanting and you'll you'll hear what they're chanting for me this choice is personal it's about who we are as a people it's about what kind of a country we want to be I grew up in Oklahoma my daddy ended up as a maintenance man and my mom worked a minimum-wage job speaking right through the guy so she the people there are chanting we trusted you right yeah does this look like a party that's divided or a party that's coming together you know and then by the way you should never trust socialists gang they're out for your money well I love when she talks about free college tuition how much money she was paid as a professor at Harvard Law when I was there I mean I knew it was ahthe Lauren she's paid four hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars a year as a professor at Harvard University Law School right that's that's what she was paid while she was there ironically she actually taught property while she was there so I guess that she was going to take everybody else's property so that was that was Elizabeth Warren speeches big highlight of the night was not Michelle Obama despite the media's accolades for her she'll be running for office and what time is it a couple of minutes but the big the big bombshell tonight was of course Bernie Sanders so first you we just have to point out Bernie Sanders is an amusing fellow here's what it looked like before Bernie Sanders went onstage he's tearing his speech and he drops it then he looks all confused and weird and yeah that's Bernie Sanders that's here that's that's the guy who's gonna save America gang that's the the the ninety eight year-old socialist who honeymooned in the Soviet Union and was too lazy for a commune legitimately in the 1960s who's thrown out of a communist itting around talking Marxist politics instead of doing work he was thrown out of the communes out his own actions are not communist stick so that's so he gets up there and he receives this massive standing ovation I mean the biggest ovation is from Vermont thank you there go thank you is like this thank you thank you all very much where am I everyone is cheering Bojo I haven't felt this good since I lasted the shower six and a half thank you did somebody thank you tygo it is they're cheering this guy wildly this a man who's never done anything with his life I mean anything he's actively made the world a worse place by backing communist dictators all across the planet he's gonna standing OH at the Democratic National Convention and then look how tepid the support is when he says that he was backing Hillary Clinton he says to the supporters this election isn't about Hillary Clinton and and people are less than enthused this election is not about and has never been about Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders or any of the other candidates who sought the presidency this election is not about political gossip it's not about polls it's not about campaign strategy it's not about fundraising it is not about all the things that the media spends so much time discussing this election is about and must be about the needs of the American people and the kind of future we create our children and our grandchildren okay so that is the Democratic convention in a nutshell is absolute chaos and punctuated by wild leftism and tonight we can look forward to president Bill Clinton is speaking where he will repudiate everything good he ever did during the 1990s at the best of his wife they'll say he was wrong about crime he wasn't he'll say he was wrong about lowering the capital gains tax rate he wasn't he'll say that he was wrong about welfare reform he wasn't and then he'll go out and he'll talk about a Hillary Clinton look Clinton I love you I haven't seen you in at least 37 years but I don't know if you knew in the lace so that'll be that'll be very inspiring I'm sure and it'll come right after the mothers of the movement what a what a horror show this convention is I'm not sure that Hillary gets a bump from this convention the reason I say that is because in the end it's gonna come down to Hillary speaking on Thursday night and she's the most charmless person I mean here's the thing about Trump most people in America haven't been watching this election cycle that closely you and I have because we're here every single day but most people are just tuning in now when the first they saw of Trump was Trump bellowing into a microphone for 75 minutes but bellowing about issues that they actually care about the first time they see Hillary is gonna be on Thursday night and it's not the first time they've seen her they've seen her for 25-30 years right and they're gonna look at her and they're gonna go oh her again seriously really people like she's got no upward mobility in these in these polling numbers all she can do really is tear down Trump presumably she'll try to do that a little bit the problem is she's so corrupt that every attack on Trump if he's if he's rubber and she's glue then you know the rest so in any case he I don't see a big bump coming out of this convention for Hillary I think it's gonna be tight for a little while events are clearly driving this election cycle it's almost beyond the points of personality normally personality dictates elections right now because Hillary and Trump are both so disliked events are dictating the nature of the election cycle so if there's a terrorist attack it helps Trump if there is a if there's a acomplish it's a black guy it helps Hillary in it's an ugly politics when your ideas are basically not relevant anymore it's just how you react on a moment-to-moment level to the things going on around you but that's what our politics has been turned into and that's that's unfortunate but this this convention has not been going well for the Democrats don't believe what the media have to tell you and the fact that they keep saying it's going well should be proof positive that they should never be trusted ever again okay time for things I like and then some and then a thing I hate okay so thing I like we're doing Russians as the villains in in film this week because of the Russians the Democrats say that the Russians hacks the DNC and passed out all these emails so the yesterday we did Eastern Promises today it's The Hunt for Red October so I will say this this is it unpopular opinion but hey that's what I do for a living so unpopular opinion Alec Baldwin is a better Jack Ryan than Harrison Ford can they play the same part I love Harrison Ford in some things but he's not as good a Jack Ryan as as Alec Baldwin because Alec Baldwin it may be utterly untrue but he can at least give the impression of intelligence on-screen Harrison Ford is too much fun to be Jack Ryan Jack Ryan supposed to be kind of a serious character with a little bit of a brooding dark side and Alec Baldwin does that better because he's leaving terrible messages on his ex-wife's phone message machine so so here is here is Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery the weirdest Russian in the world in in the Hunt for Red October which is a great movie Alec Baldwin Sam Neill Scott Glenn the Hunt for Red October I'm telling you he wants to defect sighs shake the man loose right full rudder can turn a crazy idea so it's a lot of images so you can't see it which is why you need to subscribe it daily wire but the hunt for October really really good movie if you've never seen it it's a lot of fun it's the best of the Tom Clancy flicks after this they did there there's actually a couple that are really good clear and present danger is is really good and has one of my favorite lines and movie history so we'll have to save that for another time but but the hunt for October is the best of the Jack Ryan films okay time for some things that I hate so quick detail on this isis attack in normandy apparently i six you know kills this this priest they walk into a church and they just slaughter the guy he's 86 years old and they slaughter him literally on the altar according to sister danielle de la fast she was able to escape the attack before she fled she told the station she witnessed the perpetrators who are filming the attacks gather around the church altar and performs some sort of religious raishin in arabic before forcing Hamill to his knees and placing a knife to his neck the congregants pled with the attackers to stop she said okay the police apparently had an electronic tag on the guy and that wasn't enough so he went and he killed the priest anyway again religion of peace religion of peace it's always the religion of peace that's involved in these sorts of things and it's it's really it's really quite terrible the you know first of all if you know the city the reason you know the cities because you know you World War two history but the but the the cathedral itself the church in which took place a beautiful beautiful place and obviously the murder of the priest is pretty is pretty incredible and I hope that it will jog the Europeans and to further awareness that it is not a smart idea to bring in unvetted unvetted Muslim immigrants to to their continent because it's going to continue to be a problem okay final thing I want to discuss today Michael Jordan has now decided that he has to sound off about the police and black people so he released a statement in Michael Jordan he's been kind of studiously non-political for years and there's this tendency in the because the sports media tend to be left also and are very strongly left they're constantly trying to push athletes into making statements of conscience because they think that this makes a big deal here's what Michael Jordan just wrote you are it as a proud American a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence and a black man I've been deeply troubled by the deaths of African Americans at the hands of law enforcement and by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers I grieve with the families who have lost loved ones I know their pain all too well I was raised by parents who taught me to love and respect people regardless of their race or background so I'm saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late I know this country is better than that I can no longer stay silent we need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment and that police officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all I respected and supported and then he talks about the dedication of law enforcement officers and he says he has respect for their sacrifice and service and then he says I also recognize for many people of color their experiences with law enforcement have been different than mine I decided to speak out in the hope we can come together as Americans through peaceful dialogue in education achieve constructive change so here's my problem my problem is not obviously these praising the cops my problem is that there is this false notion that every time you talk about the cops you have to say well I've had good experiences with the police but black people all over the United States are being targeted by the cops Michael Jordan's father was killed by a couple of black guys he's murdered by a couple of black guys and their race is irrelevant except for the fact that the vast majority of met black men who are killed in the United States are killed by other black people the idea that the police are targeting black folks Jordan could have done better than this Jordan could have said look my experience with police has been fantastic I think the police are doing a really hard job and I would call on more black Americans to think about how we lower the crime rate in our communities rather than suggesting that the cops are responsible for all of our problems you know this is this is really I wish that there weren't such pressure for so many people you know to hop on the moral equivalence bandwagon the police shooting black people and people shooting the police it's not the same thing okay final thing Sean Spicer of the RNC just issued this statement he was asked about David Duke you know we mentioned yesterday that David Duke is now running for Senate in Louisiana and because it's a top to runoff system in Louisiana there's a very good shot that David Duke ends up in the top two Sean Spicer is the is the spokesperson for the RNC who's asked if party control of the Senate were up for grabs and the Supreme Court with the RNC back Duke he said at some point you have to stand up for some kind of principle David Duke does not speak for where the Republican Party is so where should they draw the line he says what was the Supreme Court ruling on limiting free speech and you know what you see it I mean at some point when you're a white supremacist that's a white and black issue there's no grace as Sean Spicer okay if if the only place that you can draw the line if the only place that you can draw the line is the David Duke I would suggest your drawing your lines in the wrong place and that that goes for everyone across the political spectrum find your principle stick by our principle principles won't fail you people will so stick with your principles okay folks that brings us to the end of today's show I'm sure there will be more fun and games at the DNC tonight particularly when they decide to bring forth the black lives matter movement which is what the Democratic Party is going to do tonight we'll bring you all of the updates and then on Thursday we'll be broadcasting from Washington DC except to speak at a young America's Foundation dinner over there but we will be live nonetheless and we will make sure that you are there to see it I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show you
