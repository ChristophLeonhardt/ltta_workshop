1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,670
If the US or North Korea had a Facebook page,
each country would change their status to

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,670
“it's complicated” now.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:11,320
It's not what we had as recently as 2017 when
Trump was threatening to go to war over and

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,959
over again with North Korea.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,580
They will be met with fire and fury like the
world has never seen.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,540
Now they are not only on speaking terms but
literally sitting in a room with each other.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,320
We will have a terrific relationship.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,500
I have no doubt.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,629
Chairman Kim and I just signed a joint statement
in which he reaffirmed his unwavering commitment

10
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:40,190
to complete denuclearization.

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,739
The problem with this is that Trump and North
Korea have very different views about what

12
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:48,620
should be accomplished when you denuclearize
the Korean Peninsula.

13
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,379
The US wants North Korea to give up its nuclear
weapons.

14
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:00,059
North Korea wants the United States to stop
isolating it diplomatically and stop cutting

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,840
it off from international markets.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,140
In theory, there is the makings of a deal
there.

17
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,300
For Trump, denuclearization means something
called CVID: complete, verifiable, irreversible

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,210
denuclearization of North Korea.

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,300
They give up their nuclear weapons and the
US will always be able to make sure that they

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,680
have gone away.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,660
However, for North Korea, denuclearization
of the Korean peninsula mean something completely

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,160
different.

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,940
It means, sure, North Korea gets rid of its
nukes, but the US also withdrawals all its troops

24
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,780
from the Korean Peninsula and ends its
alliance with South Korea.

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,290
This has been unacceptable to every American
president in the past.

26
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,810
We will be stopping the war games, which will
save us a tremendous amount of money, unless

27
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:47,920
and until we see that the future negotiation
is not going along like it should.

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,040
What seems really good for North Korea is
really bad by American standards.

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,159
There's just not a great middle ground that
could actually roll back North Korea's nuclear

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,860
program.

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,200
No country with a nuclear program as advanced
as North Korea's has ever denuclearized.

32
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,360
A 2017 estimate from the Defense Intelligence
Agency concluded that North Korea probably

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,440
has up to 60 nuclear weapons.

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,510
It also has ballistic missiles that could potentially
hit the American homeland and potentially

35
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,500
a nuclear weapon small enough to fit on one
of those rockets.

36
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,580
National security adviser John Bolton floated
an idea for dealing with North Korea that

37
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,300
he called,

38
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,300
the Libya model.

39
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,240
So this is to reference an agreement struck
with the Bush administration by then Libyan

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,920
dictator Muammar Qaddafi to give up his nuclear
program.

41
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,930
However, Qaddafi's program was way more limited.

42
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,900
He wasn't really even close to a bomb.

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,300
And, perhaps more to the point, about eight
years after this agreement was struck in 2011

44
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,780
the US backed an uprising against Qaddafi
which killed him.

45
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,300
To Kim, Libya is an example of what happens
if you trust the United States too much.

46
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,250
It's an example of what happens if you give
up your nuclear weapons.

47
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,020
The main reason they want them is to deter an
attack.

48
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,750
Ideally, they want to deter any war from starting
by making the war seem really scary and really

49
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,640
dangerous and really bloody.

50
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,800
Normalizing relations is something that I
would expect to do, I would hope to do, when

51
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,820
everything is complete.

52
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,540
Normalization is a prize from North Korea's
point of view.

53
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:23,260
It would mean a US embassy in Pyongyang, a
North Korean embassy in Washington, ambassadors,

54
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,560
formal diplomatic receptions.

55
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,280
And like I'm saying this and you're probably
imagining that sounds ridiculous and you're

56
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,780
right.

57
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,140
Because it's North Korea.

58
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,200
Unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearization

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,319
of the Korean peninsula. This is the document

60
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,319
that we just signed.

61
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,680
It's hard to imagine the endgame being some
kind of big big deal.

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,270
What's more likely is nothing changes or things
get worse again.

63
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,819
I think he’s going to do these things.

64
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:53,819
I may be wrong.

65
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,300
I mean I may stand before you in 6 months
and say, ‘Hey, I was wrong.’

66
00:03:58,300 --> 00:00:00,000
I don’t know that I’ll ever admit that, but
I’ll find some kind of an excuse.
