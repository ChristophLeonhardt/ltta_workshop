My name is Brad Peyton.
I’m the director of “Rampage."
All right.
What you see here
is a C-17 starting
to crash on the outside.
That’s the largest military
plane in the US military.
Inside you have
Davis and Kate trying
to figure out what to do
now that they’ve knocked
George, the gorilla who
was rampaging on the plane,
unconscious.
The challenge here
was on the outside
we basically did an aerial unit,
but on the inside everything
was shot on a
sound stage and you
have Dwayne Johnson
and Naomie Harris
actually on these
rigs, these wire rigs,
so that you could have the
sense they were falling.
We had these massive
wind machines.
Like there, you see Jeffrey
Dean Morgan and these guys
flying around.
We actually had plane engines
that were blowing wind
through the whole set.
All the fire and
the black smoke,
everything dangerous,
was added in post.
But there were a
lot of real stunts.
Like, you’ll see
here in a second.
There you go.
You see Naomie lets
go and flies out.
We really pulled her at the
back of a plane on a sound stage
and then hooked her up
with a digital double
when she came outside.
There’s George, and George
is actually waking up,
and this stunt’s real.
This is Dwayne leaping back
to get to Jeffrey Dean Morgan
because he realizes
at this point
that he can’t leave Jeffrey and
has to get him off this plane
as well.
Everything is shot
in the direction
there where you see George,
the gorilla, was just a plate
and we added George
and the forklift
and the fire and
all that in post.
But this stuff, with the real
cast, is all shot for real.
And this is a really
interesting shot
because it actually takes two
completely different shots
and puts them
together, the first one
being on the plane and the
second one being skydivers.
And of course, they
would never let
us have Jeffrey Dean Morgan and
Dwayne actually skydive, so we
have real skydivers
being photographed,
and then we take a face
replacement process in post
to put them into
the scene and focus
on the emotion of the scene
And what you see here in the
last couple of angles of Dwayne
is something that I was
interested in doing because you
just don’t see movies shot
this way, where we mounted
a camera on the skydiver.
So you felt really
grounded and real.
And then in post, again, we
did a facial capture session
with Dwayne to get
the emotion right.
And this is actually a real
shot with real skydivers
and then we just
added the explosion.
