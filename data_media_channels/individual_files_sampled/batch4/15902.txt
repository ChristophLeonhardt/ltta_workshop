it's day three of our trip here to Israel and today we're in the town of sir rote we're in a playground that was built with the help of the Jewish National Fund now this is an indoor playground and it also serves as a bomb shelter because stir oat is just one kilometer away from the Gaza Strip which means the people here live with the constant threat of bomb attacks and because of that this has become the bomb shelter capital of the world in this indoor playground there are bomb shelters all around the exterior it's a whole different way of raising kids here in stroke we're playing outside can be deadly if your child can't get to a bomb shelter within that 15 seconds it's counterintuitive to the way I raise my kids in Canada shuffling them outside to get fresh air the dangers of living so close to Gaza have left the children of stir oat with 70% of them exhibiting some form of PTSD symptoms for the rebel media I'm Shiela gun Reid it's day three of our trip here to Israel and we're in the town of stroke but to see all of our coverage of our trip here to Israel go to rebel Israel calm
