1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
president Trump's former campaign
chairman Paul Manafort at this hour

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,629
calling on investigators to release any
intercepts of his phone calls or other

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,990
communications he says put it out there
in a statement Manta Ford spokesman

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,860
writes mr. man affort requests that the
Department of Justice released any

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,150
intercepts involving him in any non
Americans so interested parties can come

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,560
to the same conclusion as the DOJ there
is nothing there

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,710
Pamela Brown is out front in Washington
tonight and Pamela you first broke the

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,070
news at mana fort was wiretapped and
obviously his team is angry about that

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,000
and so they're saying release the
records that's right this is the first

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,309
time that pop mana Ford is responding to
our exclusive reporting that he was

11
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,300
being surveilled by the US government
under a FISA warrant under a secret

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,280
court order at least two times and as
you pointed out mana Ford is now calling

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,600
for the Justice Department to release
any intercepts these conversations that

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,910
he had involving him to the public he's
asking DOJ to do that claiming that

15
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,110
there is nothing there and he wants the
public to judge and as I pointed out

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,159
this is the first time that he is
actually making his voice heard in the

17
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,119
wake of this reporting that he was under
surveillance by the US government both

18
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,100
before and after the election and during
that time frame he spoke to President

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,610
Trump he was his former campaign
chairman he spoke to him on the phone

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,280
and the same time frame that he was
under surveillance according to our

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,939
sources it's unclear at those
conversations were ever picked up as

22
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,500
part of this surveillance and also in
this statement errand man affort says

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,490
that the US Department of Justice's
Inspector General should conduct an

24
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,970
investigation into these leaks and
examine the motivations behind the

25
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,229
previous administration's efforts to
surveil a political opponent that is

26
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,280
also a line we have heard from the
current administration calling for leak

27
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,540
investigations manda fort was initially
put under surveillance for his ties to a

28
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,799
pro-russian regime in Ukraine and then
later for the FBI's investigation into

29
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,869
Trump campaigns associates and Russians
and any possible collusion today we

30
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,710
should note Aaron that Senator Grassley
of the Judiciary Committee told my

31
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,690
colleague Manu Raju on camera that mana
Ford has not been cooperating with his

32
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,410
committee he also said Manta Ford may
not meet with the Judiciary Committee

33
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,060
because
he was told he was facing indictment

34
00:02:15,060 --> 00:00:00,000
during a raid on his Virginia home in
July Aaron
