1
00:00:01,984 --> 00:00:02,685
JONG-UN.

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:04,820
>> Rick: GREG, WHAT CAME OUT OF

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,988
TODAY'S SUMMIT?

4
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:08,090
>> RICK AND SANDRA, NO MORE WAR.

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,959
I THINK THAT WAS THE HEADLINE

6
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:12,061
THAT CAME OUT OF TODAY'S SUMMIT.

7
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:15,598
A BIT LIGHT ON DETAIL BUT VERY

8
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,199
STRONG ON MESSAGE.

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,367
KIM JONG-UN BECOMING THE FIRST

10
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:22,037
NORTH KOREAN LEADER SINCE THE

11
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:24,173
KOREAN WAR TO STEP FOOT INSIDE

12
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:27,243
OF SOUTH KOREA DOING IT AT THE

13
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:30,713
DMZ TO GREET PRESIDENT MOON

14
00:00:30,713 --> 00:00:32,848
JAE-IN THROUGH A CAREFULLY

15
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:33,782
CHOREOGRAPHED THREE.

16
00:00:33,782 --> 00:00:35,417
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER HANDLED

17
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:36,352
HIMSELF WELL ACCORDING TO

18
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,519
EXPERTS WE SPOKE TO HIM.

19
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:41,390
THE FIRST TIME FOR HIM ON THE

20
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,791
INTERNATIONAL LIVE STAGE.

21
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,628
AT THE END OF SEVERAL LONG

22
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,963
SESSIONS THE TWO LEADERS CALLED

23
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:49,431
FOR COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION

24
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:51,467
BUT NO REALTIME FRAME GIVEN AND

25
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:52,434
NO SPECIFICS.

26
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:54,770
LIKEWISE A DRAMATIC CALL FOR A

27
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,639
PEACE TREATY MAYBE THIS YEAR

28
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,340
WHICH COULD FORMALLY END THE

29
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,974
KOREAN WAR.

30
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:03,646
BUT AGAIN IN THE PAST THAT HAS

31
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,780
INVOLVED HAGGLING.

32
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,916
AFTER LAST YEAR'S MISSILES AND

33
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,050
NUKES, A SUMMIT THAT TALKS

34
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,818
ABOUT A NEW ERA OF PEACE,

35
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:11,120
THAT'S NOT BAD, RICK.

36
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,988
>> Rick: WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT

37
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:14,156
HAS HIS OWN PLANNED SUMMIT WITH

38
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:15,791
KIM IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

39
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:19,295
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THAT

40
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:19,662
SUMMIT?

41
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,096
>> ACCORDING TO THE EXPERTS

42
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:22,731
THAT WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO

43
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:26,468
HERE, THIS WAS REALLY NOT A BAD

44
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:26,969
WARM-UP.

45
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,338
AGAIN, NO DETAILS WERE SPELLED

46
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:35,244
OUT ABOUT THAT DENUCLEARIZATION

47
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:36,812
SO PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN CUT TO

48
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:37,279
THE CHASE.

49
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:39,181
HOW, WHEN, WHERE IT WILL HAPPEN.

50
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,582
LIKEWISE THE WHITE HOUSE NO

51
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:44,219
DOUBT GOT A SENSE OF THIS YOUNG

52
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:45,154
LEADER.

53
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:46,422
PROBABLY GOT THE SAME

54
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:49,625
IMPRESSION MANY HERE GOT.

55
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,428
A BIT MORE FLEXIBLE THAN

56
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:52,895
EXPECTED.

57
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:54,997
AFTER STUDYING KIM JONG-UN I

58
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:56,398
ASKED ONE OBSERVER IS THIS A

59
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:59,301
GUY THAT DONALD TRUMP CAN DO

60
00:01:59,301 --> 00:01:59,768
BUSINESS WITH?

61
00:01:59,768 --> 00:00:00,000
I WAS TOLD YES BUT WITH A
