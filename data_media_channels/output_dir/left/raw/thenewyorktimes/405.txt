1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,020
I drove along the straw-colored
cliffs of the Columbia River

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,100
before climbing on to dry high
desert plateaus winding,

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,990
along wild rivers and passing
through pine forests.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,380
As soon as I saw the Wallowa Valley,
I understood how someone

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,950
might get hooked.

6
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,380
It reminded me of the placid
beauty of the Great Plains.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,229
Awed by our surroundings,
my husband, Tim, and I huddled

8
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,420
in blankets by the fireside, then
snuck into the Pendleton wool blankets

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,620
that topped each tepee bed
for a night of rest.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,339
The next day was bright and clear. 
The wind from the previous evening

11
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,840
had cleared the smoke and as we 
drove down the rimrock ridge

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,799
the air grew warm.

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,539
My distaste for heights had kept me from
the Wallowa Lake Tramway, built in 1970.

14
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:05,519
The 15 minute gondola ride
is near 4,000 foot vertical

15
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,149
descent from the summit of
Mount Howard peaking at 8,150 feet.

16
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:15,199
For me, the tram was less of a
draw than a dare.

17
00:01:15,199 --> 00:00:00,000
One that I was determined to accept.
