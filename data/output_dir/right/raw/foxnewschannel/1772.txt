1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:01,195
THAT DEATH COUNT RISE.

2
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:02,130
IT'S BEEN A BIG DAY HERE WITH

3
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,401
THE OPENING OF THE EMBASSY.

4
00:00:06,401 --> 00:00:07,502
NEIL?

5
00:00:07,502 --> 00:00:10,438
>> Neil: THANKS VERY MUCH,

6
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:10,805
BENJAMIN.

7
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:13,641
OIL PRICES MOVING UP ON

8
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:14,876
CONCERNSES THAT THERE'S ANGST

9
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:19,480
OVER THIS AND ON THE IRAN DEAL.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,149
THE READ NOW FROM FLORIDA'S

11
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,253
ATTORNEY GENERAL, PAM BONDI.

12
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:28,489
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS?

13
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:31,693
OUTSIDE OF GUATEMALA AND

14
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:33,161
PARAGUAY, THERE WASN'T A CONGO

15
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:34,595
LINE OF COUNTRIES FOLLOWING SUIT

16
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:34,996
HERE?

17
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:36,698
>> IT SHOWS THAT WE'RE THE

18
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:39,367
STRONGEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD,

19
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:39,667
NEIL.

20
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,336
OUR PRESIDENT DOES WHAT HE SAYS

21
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:44,305
HE'S GOING TO DO.

22
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:46,841
I THINK IT'S A STRONG NOT ONLY

23
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:50,745
SHOW OF STRENGTH BUT ALSO UNITY.

24
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:52,246
ISRAEL WAS OUR GREATEST ALLY IN

25
00:00:52,246 --> 00:00:53,014
THE WORLD.

26
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:55,350
I'M SO PROUD OF WHAT HAPPENED

27
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,650
TODAY.

28
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,319
I'VE BEEN TO ISRAEL TWICE AS

29
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:59,287
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

30
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:01,923
JERUSALEM IS THE CAPITOL OF

31
00:01:01,923 --> 00:01:02,256
ISRAEL.

32
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:03,691
>> Neil: AS YOU KNOW WITH THESE

33
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:05,226
PALESTINIAN PROTESTS, THE FEARS

34
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:07,195
ARE THAT IT'S AGITATE AGO LOT OF

35
00:01:07,195 --> 00:01:08,296
THE VIOLENCE.

36
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:12,100
ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS THAT THE

37
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,236
PALESTINIANS LOOK FORWARD TO A

38
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:16,004
HOMELAND OF THEIR OWN.

39
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:17,605
THE KEY TO THAT WOULD BE MAKING

40
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:18,673
JERUSALEM ITS CAPITOL.

41
00:01:18,673 --> 00:01:22,276
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY NOW.

42
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:25,480
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE?

43
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,616
>> THE U.S. WAS IN THE FINAL

44
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:30,785
STAGES OF FINALIZING OUR PEACE

45
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:33,755
PLAN WITH ISRAEL AND PALESTINE

46
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:36,357
AND JARED KUSHNER.

47
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:39,394
HE'S AN AMAZING PERSON.

48
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:41,329
HE'S A GREAT NEGOTIATOR AS WELL

49
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:43,131
AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

50
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:43,464
STATES.

51
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:45,566
I FEEL THAT -- I THINK THIS

52
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:46,367
SHOWS STRENGTH.

53
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,503
IT SAYS THAT WE MEAN WHAT WE

54
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:48,803
SAY.

55
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:50,605
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALWAYS SAID,

56
00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:52,507
JERUSALEM IS THE CAPITOL AND IT

57
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:55,076
IS NOW FIRMLY THE CAPITOL.

58
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:56,644
AND WE DIDN'T WAIT YEARS, WE

59
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:57,812
DIDN'T SPEND A BILLION DOLLARS

60
00:01:57,812 --> 00:01:58,579
TO DO IT.

61
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:00,515
THE PRESIDENT SAID IT WAS GOING

62
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:02,784
TO HAPPEN AND IT HAPPENED.

63
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:04,585
SO HE'S NOT CONCEDING OTHER

64
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:04,919
THINGS.

65
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:07,155
WE'RE SAYING THAT THIS IS GOING

66
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:09,690
TO BE A NEGOTIATION.

67
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,292
NOTHING ELSE HAS BEEN FINALIZED

68
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:13,061
REGARDING BORDERS AND OTHER

69
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:14,429
ISSUES.

70
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:16,097
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP

71
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:17,999
FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL.

72
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:18,900
>> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AN

73
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,003
IMPORTANT STEP, I WANT TO TALK

74
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:24,972
ABOUT THE NOTION THAT THERE'S

75
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:26,641
ANGST IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND

76
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,176
IRAN GOING IT ALONE.

77
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:31,679
SO FAR PULLING AWAY FROM THE

78
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,713
AGREEMENT, DO YOU WORRY THAT

79
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:33,881
WHATEVER OUR CAUSE AND WHETHER

80
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:35,983
IT'S JUST OR NOT, THE FACT THAT

81
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:39,520
WE'RE LARGELY ALONE COULD BE A

82
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:39,987
PROBLEM?

83
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:42,757
>> NO, AGAIN, WE'RE ALONE BUT

84
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:43,458
WE'RE BRAVE.

85
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,093
THAT SHOWS STRENGTH.

86
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:48,429
PULLING OUT OF THE JCPOA WAS

87
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,465
PROBABLY ONE OF THE SMARTEST

88
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:51,799
THINGS WE COULD DO.

89
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,134
IRAN HAS LIED TO US FOR YEARS

90
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:54,702
ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

91
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:56,437
THERE WERE NO INSPECTIONS GOING

92
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:56,737
ON.

93
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:57,939
THAT HAS TO STOP.

94
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:58,706
THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENT

95
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:00,174
TRUMP, KNOWS HOW TO HIT THEM.

96
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:01,275
WE SAW THAT WITH CHINA.

97
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:04,212
HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO, HOW TO HIT

98
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:05,746
THEM WITH TRADE, THE FINANCIAL

99
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:06,080
MARKET.

100
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,881
THE ECONOMY.

101
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:09,083
EVERYTHING HE CAN DO TO IMPACT

102
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,384
THEM TO STOP MAKING THESE

103
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:12,620
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND PROVIDING

104
00:03:12,620 --> 00:00:00,000
TOOLS TO HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH.
