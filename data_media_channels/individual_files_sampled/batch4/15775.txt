guardians of the galaxy are now the guardians of their former director not coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel some of my fellow rebels last week told you about the James gun guardians of the galaxy Disney debacle but if you haven't heard James Gunn who has been the director of the guardians of the galaxy franchise he was let go from Disney and the third installment of the franchise Disney a company known for content that caters to children they fired him after past comments on social media revealed some pretty ugly things just the name of U he joked about rape pedophilia aids 911 and the Holocaust so to give you some scope these are a few of his comments I like when little boys touch me in my silly place and another the best thing about being raped is when you're done being raped and it's like whoo this feels great not being raped so yeah pretty gross no I am NOT going to debate the merits of the decision to fire him of course I believe in freedom of speech especially when it comes to comedy and clearly his sick humor I guess is what enabled him to think that what he was saying was humorous I personally don't find it funny at all but when you have a company like Disney who puts out children's movies I think Disney has every right to fire him in light of the fact that their content and his humor do not coincide after firing him Disney released this statement the offensive attitude and statements discovered on James's Twitter feed are indefensible and inconsistent with our studio's values and we have severed our business relationship with him and now the cast of guardians of the galaxy have released a statement of their own via actor Chris Pratt the statement says this it's very long but I'm just gonna read a little paragraph we were all shocked by his abrupt firing last week and have intentionally waited these 10 days to respond in order to think pray listen and discuss in that time we've been encouraged by the outpouring of support from fans and members of the media who wished to see James reinstated as director of volume 3 as well as discouraged by those who so easily who were so easily duped into believing the many outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding him bad move Guardians bad news outlandish conspiracy theories his own comments are there in black and white no one needs to conspire against him because he has put the destructive and deplorable comments out there for everyone to see and if you're talking about the theory the content and sheer volume of these types of comments could lead one to believe that there is a psychological problem relating to Pella pedophilia that theory is not what he was fired for he was fired for the comment and I used to really like Chris Pratt he's a family man or he was he divorced his wife Anna Faris but they have kids together he's a Christian and seems to be a pretty decent guy but the fact that he's a part of this I think is going to cause a lot of his fans to think twice and not just specifically fans of his fans of the franchise I think will not be too happy about this statement and the fact that the cast is vying for James Gunn's reinstatement truthfully I didn't see the first two movies but I definitely won't see the third one I don't really think that I'm alone in this but I'm curious what you think were you a fan of the franchise all along and will you continue to stick by them or are you gonna dump it let us know in the comments thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at WWWE need for words last shows make sure you're following us on Facebook and Twitter for all of our latest news and download our new app for the rebel media on the App Store that way you will have instant and easy access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
