excellent to these three incredible people they are really three incredible people he was nice in letting him go before the meeting I mean frankly we didn't think this was going to happen and it did Donald Trump this week welcome back welcome back three Americans who had been detained in North Korea and praised the dictator who had held them captive in the first place hours later the White House announced that trumps anticipated meeting with Kim jong-un will take place June 12th in Singapore joining me now is Joe Cirincione president of the Ploughshares fund and Christine on founder of women cross dmz thank you both for being here I want to start with you miss on and thank you very much for being the show welcome to the show and what did you make of Donald Trump's statement that kim jeong-hoon had been nice and praising him him have he having taken these three Americans prisoner in the first place what did you make of that phrase well I thought he was setting the tones for the upcoming summit with Kim jong-un in Singapore and a huge obstacle towards improve relations had been removed by the freeing of the three prisoners and so I just think Donald Trump was trying to return you know the positive gesture that North Korea put forward ahead of the talks by freeing the American prisoners and Joseph in Sione it's quite a difference in the way that Donald Trump talks about Kim Jong or now then he used to let me play just a little compendium of his prior version of his remarks about the North Korean leader Rocketman is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime Rocketman should have been handled a long time these massive tax cuts will be rocket fuel little Rocket Man Rocket feel for the American economy what do you make of this shift on Joseph in Sione because he started with ridicule and then he's moved over to extreme praise yeah well for Donald Trump this is part of his playbook right this is the way he thinks you gain negotiating leverage excessive threats followed by excessive praise he thinks he's running the show here I think the Korean leaders both president moon of South Korea and Kim jong-un and North Korea are actually setting the stage or actually the driving dynamic here and for for president Trump this is all about him well as everything is and so the release of these prisoners it was a big show about him their families weren't there at Andrews Air Force Base they're their friends weren't there it was all about Donald Trump about his ratings you know President Obama released 11 North Korean prisoners won the release of 11 North Korean prisoners during his term he never did anything like this so this unfortunately is the kind of president we have now and you know Christine you have Donald Trump whose new Secretary of State wasn't aware that you don't refer to Kim jong-un as chairman own as he pronounced as you come back from North Korea got that wrong you've got a president that isn't much of a study but he does now seem to be doing things that are very much in the favor of Kim jong-il and things he's wanted to put himself on par with the American president Donald Trump's coming to his region so he doesn't have to travel very far I can get on a train and go to Singapore it does feel like Donald Trump is doing all the gestures you know although there is something back I'm looking at a press release here this morning from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from North Korea saying that the the North Korea is going to they're going to dismantle some of their nuclear testing grounds I wonder if you want if you can tell who is winning this sort of game of day Todd well I mean to build on what Joe said I would agree with him absolutely that the two Korean leaders are driving this but if we look at the real game-changing moment that ultimately led to a diplomatic breakthrough was the candlelight revolution in South Korea it was the people's movements that unseated that Elstad Park geun-hye the former president of South Korea who is now sitting in prison for her political corruption and it was one in three South Koreans taking to the streets demanding that they have a shift in who is in office and that also very much drove the hard-line policies of Park geun-hye and they swept in moon jae-in this is a human rights lawyer who came from a pro-democracy movement and he came into office pledging to see through a peace treaty if North Korea committed to denuclearization and that's what we're seeing now I think it's a huge win for the people of Korea and what we saw with the Panmunjom declaration was I think an unprecedented agreement that said we are declaring an end to the Korean War this is a new era for peace for the Korean Peninsula and this is the will of the people I mean moon jae-in is the most popular leader in the world in the free world he has 85 percent approval ratings for his diplomatic work with with the North Korean so I think this is a win for pieces is a win for the Korean people but this is a win for world peace I think it's a really significant moment we shouldn't poopoo this this is a 70 year conflict and this means that millions of Korean families could be reunified this means that potentially 5,000 remains of American POWs m.i.a s that still exists in North Korea could be settled it means that there can be an improvement in human rights the the head of the World Food Program just came back from North Korea and he said if there is a peace agreement it will improve the daily conditions of the North Korean people so this is a big win I think for everybody and you know just presenter I think that is in a very important point is that shouldn't we be ascribing the success to really a historic presidency by moon jae-in I mean he really has driven the diplomacy Trump wants the Nobel Prize but moon jae-in has got to be the most significant leader of South Korea that we see the least in my lifetime absolutely I can completely agree with Christine and this is very difficult for especially frost here in Washington a lot of my Democratic colleagues are very skeptical of this summit trying to get to the right of Donald Trump on this but we have to take our feelings about Donald Trump and put them a little bit of a side in some ways as Christians pointing out he is the least important figure in this drama that's unfolding things are in motion on the Korean Peninsula that are extremely important it's time to be cautiously optimistic and supportive of this summit some historic things can indeed happen indeed I think if this works out I would be shocked if if a president moon jae-in did not wind up with the Nobel Peace Prize it is very historic indeed joseon soon and christine on thank you very much
