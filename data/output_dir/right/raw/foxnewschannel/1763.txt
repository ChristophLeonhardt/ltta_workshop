BUT.

29
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:48,270
>> WHAT THEY REALLY SAID WAS

30
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:48,938
THAT CONGRESS DOESN'T HAVE

31
00:00:48,938 --> 00:00:52,074
THE RIGHT TO TELL STATE

32
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:52,975
LEGISLATORS WHAT TO DO.

33
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:54,677
THAT SHOULD BE UP TO

34
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:55,811
LEGISLATORS AND THE VOTERS.

35
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:58,280

AFFRONT TO STATE SOVEREIGNTY

42
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:09,825

43
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:11,193
JUSTICE GINSBURG WRITING THE

44
00:01:11,193 --> 00:01:12,261
DISSENT ARGUED THE COURT

45
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:14,230
COULD HAVE USED RESTRAINT IN

46
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,030
NULLIFYING THE FEDERAL LAW

47
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,066
RATHER THAN, QUOTE:  DEPLOY

48
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:18,601
A WRECKING BALL.

49
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:20,302
ADDING WHEN A STATUTE

50
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:21,437
REVEALS A CONSTITUTIONAL

51
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:23,205
FLAW, THE COURT ORDINARILY

52
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:25,307
ENGAGES IN A SALVAGE RATHER

53
00:01:25,307 --> 00:01:29,211
THAN A DEMOLITION OPERATION.

54
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:30,846
THOUSAND PLAYS OUT WITH

55
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:31,280

59
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:36,552
MOVE QUICKLY WITH THE

60
00:01:36,552 --> 00:01:37,486
LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK

61
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:38,888
ALREADY IN PLACE AT THE

62
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:39,688
STATE LEVEL.

63
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:41,824
GAMING ANALYSTS EXPECT AS

64
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:43,859
MANY AS 32 STATES TO OFFER

65
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:44,693
LEGAL BETTING WITHIN THE

66
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:45,528
NEXT FIVE YEARS.

67
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:46,862
THERE IS A FEDERAL LAW IN

68
00:01:46,862 --> 00:01:48,797
PLACE THAT APPEARS TO BAN

69
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:50,699
GAMBLING ACROSS STATE LINES.

70
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:51,967
MEANING STATES THAT DO MOVE

71
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,536
FORWARD WITH LEGALIZED

72
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,004
GAMBLING WILL HAVE TO TACKLE

73
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,605
THE ISSUE OF POLICING THEIR

74
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:58,073
OWN CYBER BORDERS.

75
00:01:58,073 --> 00:02:00,709
WITH TODAY'S OPINION TO

76
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,444
CLEARLY BACKING STATES'

77
00:02:02,444 --> 00:02:03,679
RIGHTS SOME EXPECT OTHER

78
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:04,380
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES COULD

79
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,614
SOON BE RIPE FOR THE

80
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:05,948
PICKING.

81
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:06,882
>> THIS COULD IMPACT

82
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:08,417
ANYTHING FROM MARIJUANA, GUN

83
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:10,452
LAWS, REALLY WHAT THE COURT

84
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:13,856
AFFIRMED WAS CONGRESS CANNOT

85
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:15,224
COME MEN DEER THE STATES.

86
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:16,725
>> WE ARE STILL AWAITING

87
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:17,993
DECISIONS IN SEVERAL HIGH

88
00:02:17,993 --> 00:02:19,795
PROFILE CASES INCLUDING
