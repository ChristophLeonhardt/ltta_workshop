hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter labelled serious years long catastrophe is coming to a close foreign backing of opposition and terrorist forces are in retreat and face eradication but the struggle is far from over the war is essentially won the winning a lasting peace will be no easy task crosstalking syria i'm joined by my guest adele darwish in london he is a political commentator and author of the book the edge of war in Beirut we have camel wasnae he is a political analyst and founder of the center of American true strategic studies in Beirut and in Damascus we have Danny Maki he is a Syria commentator and co-founder of Syrian digital media group all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in any time you want and I always appreciate it Adel let me go to you the best dressed man in television love the bowtie of course Adel you know we over the last few days we've seen a whole series of diplomatic activity trying to bring some kind of closure to this very long and bloody and destructive conflict in Syria it's being spearheaded by the Russians and the Iranians and the Turks they've been in consultation with other players in the region including Israel and also a telephone call between Putin and Trump are the pieces falling into place go ahead Adel well let's hope so we have always put things in historical context without the Russian rule these two major developments in the region would have more achieved one is the celebrated and now controversial America the Iranian control over the nuclear program and second the ending of the war in Syria by defeating terrorism it could have ended in an indifferent way the Russians the main objective as I concede is to keep the geographical integrity at one country of Syria which is on the objectives of the others as was was quite important what happened between that the phone call between mr. Trump and mr. Putin is very important they are superpowers because this ramp can actually pull the strings on regional powers that might have a different agenda I don't want to second guess what the agenda is but it's very actually important that all the power come thirdly you mentioned Iran and Turkey they are the neighbors right there in the region and obviously this controversial rule for Iran so let's hope again some Russian diplomacy would kick them into shape come on let me go to you in Beirut reflect upon what Adel said because you know it looks like it is is there gonna be the political will and I thought it was very interesting was the conversation between Putin Trump here can Trump fulfill any kind of obligation that he would like because his administration is very divided and how to approach the the the closure of this conflict in Syria we still hear this lingering Assad must go I worry about that the political will on the West I think that Putin wouldn't have come out with the the Iranians and the Turks if he didn't think he had something more or less nailed down with of course Assad going along with it go ahead come on in Beirut well obviously the American you cannot count on them in this end because in the beginning they declared the war in Dodge and these takfiri and those terrorist organization and they didn't fill fulfill any commitment of the opposite they helped these these entity to the last minute and that in the war and Abu Kamal that we we know for a fact that they've been helping ganach escape as a certain route so here you really count what is taking place on the ground on the ground there is a victorious here a power this emerge from the confrontation against - basically the camp headed by by by by by Syrian by the Russian by the Iranian they were able to move surgically and remove - at least militarily from from Syria obviously there's a security end of it and there is the big question well the American on Raqqa was draw their forces because the government of President Bashar Assad declare him as a legal entity so far if the American do not deal with that issue that mean they are actually they don't want the war the end as is supposed to be and they don't want the political process to and they don't want the political process to continue as it's supposed to so there is a lot of doubt when it comes to Americans especially when it comes to Donald Trump really you cannot trust what Donald Trump say to today because he could change the dynamic of his tone but in the end I don't think a lot of people on the ground taking the American as seriously they work in to the actually to the end to make sure that first they liberate all Syria and then they go into another venue where they start the dialogue to have a political discussion you know Danny III fear that even if we do get to some kind of peace process the the Trump administration will somehow take credit for it but what I do worry about here and Adele mentioned it in his opening comments is this approach to have a sovereign cereal hole Syria but at the same time we have the Pentagon coming out and saying they're not leaving militarily anytime soon that is another huge barrier to having some kind of peace process go ahead Danny I mean absolutely but if you look at the group's the u.s. is working with and relying on to have their presence in Syria and that is the the SDF and the Kurds the Kurds actually have quite a consistent recent history of giving back territory to the Syrian government and I'm sure that in in wake of what is a quite victorious Syrian military in his blood owner and in the Russians and the Iranians the Kurds will definitely think twice about keeping some of these areas which will in the future continue to jeopardize the u.s. is his presence within Syria I can't see the u.s. having forces in Syria for a long time because the if you look at the trajectory of the crisis now and the nature of how the Syrian forces were victorious the u.s. really has nothing to leave their troops in for because yeah the majority of terrorism is almost on the way of being defeated and I think the US are just doing this just to save face because yeah you discussed Donald Trump Donald Trump bombed a Syrian military a base which was you know 20 30 kilometers away from Isis right so he's not someone who's who's for terrorism successfully within Syria and what they're doing at the moment is just literally attempting to show the world that they have some sort of symbolic presence because after the Russians intervened in September 2015 they complete the the balance of powers on the ground in Syria has seen drastically began to change if you look back at the previous years in the situation in which the country and the government were actually in it was diabolical the half of the country was lost it was it was defeat after defeat after us plans for intervention and arming rebels and helping them and and now you look at the situation it's it's a complete whitewash because yeah you've got one force on the ground in the Syrian military which is now continuing to make advances and actually find some sort of military solution in its crisis well no Danny no one thought that was no one thought it was possible let me go to Adel here because I think you know if you look at Western mainstream media the United States is crushing Isis in Syria there's no mention of you know Iran there's no mention of Hezbollah and if it is it's always negative there's a very little mention of Russia or of course they probably committed a human rights violation it's really remarkable how this is being spun in Western media go ahead Adel yes quite I'm laughable actually it's shameful because that much a part of this Western media but I think it's a important issue to focus on a and until recently the Americans specifically under Obama the weren't quite serious about fighting terrorism were fighting ISIL in fact the questions in the Congress that some of the funding found its way and some of the weapons found it's out of the were to isolate and the terrorists had a lot large of the weapons and and we never found out who financed that they oughta pick up tracks and sentiments itself but we're here now what's important now really the Americans hopefully would have learned the lesson of Iraq yes he pulled out of Iraq but look at Iraq now yeah so the important thing is to you must work with the Russian because the other main force there in order to have reconciliation between different forces of course isolate the Islamic terrorists they should have been left I agree with Danny that the Kurds keeping territory for exchange for other political gains because they do not want to upset the Russian Americans the Syrian President Assad and the Turks obviously the Turks always suspicious of the cut so they will give back the territory definitely for exchange of some political security and role to play and the here comes the lesson of Iraq which is now descended into almost civil war and the Kurds who defeated ISIL about to fight with the Shia controlled government there in Baghdad so we do not want that to happen in Syria quick reconciliation our thing is doing great job the conference is there and regardless what we think of the negative American rules well at least better Kingdom in the tense yeah maybe outside one of the thing we go to go back to Beirut here one of the things that really bothers me one of the last time we even had something remotely close to this there was a ceasefire that had been agreed to and then the the u.s. attacked Syrian forces I mean completely turned everything upside down all the gains that were gained up to that point were destroyed and more mutual suspicions and even hostility here are you worried something like this else could happen because the u.s. is staying in there they gonna have to do something or leave go ahead basically my my estimate that the Syrian so far declared that the the forces American forces are illegal in Syria and in Raqqa declared is still an incubi and so that's by itself it's an obstacle to what the American basically tried to say they want to stay there they'd I mean they make it an obstacle to the peace process the Syrian actually insists in liberating or their land and having all their land under there's jurisdiction my estimate that the American wanted a piece of the pie and they don't want to leave easily from Syria there they're probably there their approach and their tactic had fail had failed in Kurdistan because probably they Bush the poorest on to declare independent they didn't come to his backing right and I'm my estimate here they can push the curve in Syria and they can make a like gain in the Russian I have to jump in here we're gonna have to go to a hard break and after that hard break we'll continue our discussion on sirius stay with our team okay dan let me go back to you in Damascus okay we've already talked about that the Russian Iranian Turkish initiative here but let's turn it upside down the other side as it were here Saudi Arabia are they going to go along with this this is real good to go along with this I don't think so these are the other obstacles here go ahead damming I completely agree I mean I mean we keep we have to separate the Israeli interest from the Saudi Arabian interest but Saudi Arabia will continue to have an intransigent stalled stance towards the crisis in Syria as it has done throughout because Syria for Saudi Arabia is it's an issue of national security and the huge failures in Saudi Arabian foreign policy in Syria have actually reflected so negatively on the state that it's now beginning to lash out regionally its bidding to lash out in the media it's even its turn to complete you know the Arab Spring Peter if you look at it it was stopped in Syria if if they are spring managed to get rid of the Syrian government this would have continued on until we had a completely new Middle East but it was stopped in his tracks in Syria and that was always the aim I mean Syria was always such an important country regionally from a geopolitical level it was it was you know a gateway to Iran it was it had a huge strategic significance because of its border with Israel and influence in Lebanon so Saudi Arabia won't stop until we it it considers it's completely bankrupt and spent in terms of the Syria crisis whereas Israelis for example they have very I would actually say precise aims within Syria and that is to continue this this kind of semi conflict on the borders between the jihadist and the Syrian military and continue to target his bullet targets within within Syria but I don't think the Israelis want more intervention I just think that they want to have a clear view point of what's happening on the Syrian side from the sense that Hezbollah is their main enemy but Saudi Arabia will turn no stone until it completely seeks the destruction of Assad even though it's lost and that's the issue here Saudi Arabia has failed diplomatically because its had no faith in diplomacy if it would have at the start of the crisis had a peace process or a negotiation or a dialogue with Assad or the Iranians this wouldn't have even happened but they chose this pathway and in the end it's ended in an absolutely stunning and embarrassing defeat for Saudi Arabia right and its allies in the region which is why this proximity with Israel is is present at the moment and that is to attempt to undercut the Iranian influence in the region okay you mentioned you met you mentioned Iran let me go to Adel cuz it always goes back to Iran here okay so let's what are the pieces on the board here we have the American military that says it's going to maintain its presence and it's not given a real justification except for to keep make sure there isn't Isis 2.0 okay fine well being there might create it okay that's what usually happens okay and also we have the the Israelis which I would say at the very least want to see a destabilized Syria they can capitalize on that and we have the Saudis that will not leave any stone unturned here and then we have someone like Donald Trump that's already been said on the program you might change his mind after his golf game we don't know okay I find this Adel to be extremely dangerous even though we have I think the piece is coming together to cede some light at the end of the tunnel but there are some people that want to keep the darkness there go ahead and doe careful not to second-guess because we in the media unless really we have a whole picture sometimes we'll get leaked information that's really no that's fair this is real here now I probably slightly disagree with that wait we're with Danny on the Saudi Arabia so Arabia which wasn't in their interest for the so-called Arab Spring which I don't call it that way anyway to continue because they are stable monarchies they don't actually means like that so stopping and serious and very interests now let's look into the American presence American process she is not sanctioned by the UN unlike the Russian which was invited by the legal UN recognized government of Syria so the Americans are on a weak legal point there let's look into the Saudi King visit to Russia and meeting with President Putin what actually was agreed there something very interesting Syria must have been discussed sure the mutual interests of the two the more destructive rule was more Qatar who were actually punching about the weight rather than Saudi Arabia as well yes I agree I remember once an Israeli officer taking me to the border was level and said this is our frontline with Iran so they have they always have this insecurity they always has in the back of their mind rightly or wrongly that Hezbollah wants the total destruction so their interest is slightly different from Syria from Saudi Arabia who have seen Iranian intervention because let's not forget the the Islamic Revolution was for export the three circles who many wanted so the second circle is exporting it to the Arab countries whether she are minority there get a Shia to apprise we have the during the 12 Grammys problem so slightly different problems there as seen from Syria point of view and I'm almost certain this issue was discussed when infamously Arabia visited Moscow and there's some agreement mustard in the reach okay I agree with you there let me go - camel in inve Road okay go ahead jump in Danny that's the point of the program go ahead just really quickly but but but in the sense of you if you look at it regionally look Saudi Arabia's arch-nemesis is Iran Iran's best ally in the region is Syria by by a huge distance by a huge miles so it's definitely in Saudi Arabia Arabia's interest from the inception of the so-called Arab Spring to make sure that this country has huge problems and isn't in a period of absolute instability because it's crucial for it for its own national interest in its prolonged regional war with Iran so I would absolutely 100 percent rest by the fact that salary were wanted an Arab Spring in Syria because if they didn't have that spring then Iranian influence would be even stronger than it already is I see I see Adele disagreeing I think we're all we have maybe different different definitions of Arab Spring here let me go to camel here in in Beirut I'm really glad that Adele brought up the the the visit of the the Saudi King to Moscow and obviously they talked about Syria here I guess what really interests me is it when one you recognize what your interests are pragmatically but then you see an opportunity and you want to throw the dice I think that's what bothers me because as Danny is pointed out I mean if you look at the Saudi foreign policy in the last few years it goes from one blunder from one catastrophe to another and there doesn't seem to be stopping even though they understand that that they have these national interest visa vie Hezbollah and and Syria here is Saudi Arabia does such a trustworthy enough partner go ahead in Beirut well obviously the the Saudi are not happy about what is taking place there there's they feel that they lost that the Battle of this big battle for seven years they've been supporting the Opposition in Syria they've been supporting the opposition or whatever the activity that was taking place in in in in in Iraq so now you have you have that the road that a lot of these country were afraid that goes from Tehran to Lebanon can go through with with the with a victory because of the surgical operation that was done that was supported by by the Iranian by liberating by liberal liberating Iraq and basically defeating - in Iraq and now we have a major victory in Syria so how much society can do about this not very much they already put a big fight for it and basically they didn't know did not win that fight so basically all they can do is just maybe go to Lebanon they try to do medal and inside the borders of Lebanon and they were not successful either I think the point for the Saudi is to make a compromise and start well you know it would be really nice to take a war in Yemen and any idea the bus thank you can for for them absolutely I'm glad you mentioned Yemen Adel okay we're rapidly running out of time I want to ask all three of you what about the future of Assad because if you look at some of the communicates coming out I guess we're from Sochi there is good to be political reform what does it mean to you because I'm sure it means something else to the Americans go ahead Adel yeah it's an interesting point actually the future of Assad historically countries who wanted to play a regional many superpower they never interested in destabilizing enable because that destabilization I'll have refugees coming to the on problems etc but they might want to install a regime that actually can pull the strings so they wanted a ruler or regime that support and further an interest rather than destabilizing it and here comes the point about the peace process again if we look from a Moscow point of view they do not support Assad per se the woman's stability agree annuity carry the integrity agree geographical integrity of Syria peace and obviously the legitimate Russian interests because the American the opinion expansion leaves only one base for the Russian fleet which is in Toulouse and Latakia that has to be respected as sphere of influence in okay gentlemen we're rapidly time I don't want to ask all three did any same question political reform what does it mean to you it's an absolute must you could have more political parties you've got to have a more liberal nature of of the ideology of the governing party here but at the same time Assad's in a great position because he can play the Kurds off with the Turks Viktor he won he won I mean that he can play that card more or less you know we don't want to jinx it but he has essentially won and it's been pretty it's been convincing as well so what what I would like to see as a Syrian is more political reforms is more of a freer media and free speech and this to happen gradually in the sense that we see some of this happening because people haven't fought for seven years they fun for something this type of political room exactly a Kamali I'm gonna give you the last 40 seconds in Beirut the political reformer does it mean to you forty seconds basically this is a political process a democratic about democratic process I think we'll leave it to the people of Syria I think that mr. Assad has the upper hand because he he has proven that he has the interest of the country and I think he preserved the country as the war continued and basically I hope that their settlement political settlement will sit down well Jim well gentlemen after so many years the Syrian people should finally be given a voice and finally given a chance to have peace here I want to thank my guests in London Beirut and in Damascus and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember Rostock rules
