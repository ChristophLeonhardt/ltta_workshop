1
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,820
Our chimes go off at 9 oâ€™clock 
every day,

2
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,770
9 a.m. and 9 p.m. to commemorate
the Emanuel nine.

3
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,700
So I think a lot of times 
people will look

4
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,590
and begin to say well surely
maybe after year two

5
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,599
they should be fine, year three 
they should be fine.

6
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,330
It's going to take some time.

7
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,520
You don't want to forget.

8
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,650
Early on even when I was
assigned here,

9
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,670
several people wanted
to remodel down here

10
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,850
to just kind of change
the scenery so to speak.

11
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,400
When you begin to think about
mass casualty,

12
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,770
when you begin to think about
murdering

13
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,590
taking place in a sacred place,
I think in actuality

14
00:01:41,590 --> 00:00:00,000
what happens is each day
you find new strength.
