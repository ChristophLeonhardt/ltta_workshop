JOE: THE PENINSULA ECONOMY,

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,495
SILICON VALLEY'S GROWTH ADDING

11
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:31,564

TURKEY ARE MORE STABLE THAN

00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,307
ONE OF THE WORST DAYS WE CAN

00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:26,619
MATT: IF YOU LOOK AT MYLAN,

00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,857
NEGATIVE PUBLICITY BUILDING FOR

31
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,293
THE AMOUNT OF CHARGES FOR ITS

00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,195

33
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:41,534
WE HAVE ONE PRODUCER THAT NEEDS

34
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,368
AN EPIPEN ALL THE TIME BECAUSE

35
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,604

00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,471
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT, YOU CAN

38
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:51,811
SO MYLAN HAS BEEN ABLE TO RAISE

39
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:56,149
THE PRICE TO $600.

40
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,552
IN 2007, THE EPIPEN WAS $57, SO

41
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,386
THEY HAVE RAISED THE PRICE QUITE

42
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,722
A BIT.

43
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:03,523
HILLARY CLINTON AND CONGRESS

00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,579

53
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,515
HERE ARE SOME 30 YEAR YIELDS.

YOU WANT SOME YIELD?

55
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,821
HERE ARE SOME.

56
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,722
THERE'S THE CONCERN ABOUT THE

57
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:39,225
FINANCE MINISTER, HE IS IN

58
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,362

59
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,596
KIND OF LEGAL ISSUES HE COULD

00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,667

61
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,638
YIELDS ARE SHOOTING UP.

62
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:55,575
MEANWHILE, YIELDS ARE HIGHER IN

63
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,944
THE WEST TODAY, BUT ON A SMALLER

64
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:58,311

65
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,413
A MODEST TAKE HIGHER, 1.56 ON

00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:00,880

00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:10,422
TURKISH LIRA.

69
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:11,190
TURKEY LAUNCHED ITS BIGGEST

70
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,425
MILITARY OPERATION IN SYRIA TO

71
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:17,830
FIGHT BACK AGAINST ISIS.

72
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,836
THE CURRENCY DID PARENTS LOSSES

73
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:24,637
AFTER JOE BIDEN VOICED SUPPORT

74
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:30,042
FOR TURKEY DURING A VISIT.

75
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,412
NORTH KOREA LAUNCHED A BALLISTIC

00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,079
MISSILE, SO A LOT OF

77
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,813
GEOPOLITICAL CONCERNS HERE.

78
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,749
THE WEAKNESS IN THE WON IS A

79
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,052
RELIEF TO THE GOVERNMENT.

80
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,386
OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS, THE

81
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,990

82
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,992
PERFORMERS.

83
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,994
THAT IS PAINFUL FOR THE NATION'S

84
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:48,962
WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO THE YEN.

85
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:53,099
JOE: OIL HAS BEEN SWINGING

86
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,669
BACK-AND-FORTH, BUT HAS NOT HAD

00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,072

88
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,075
IT HAD RALLIED EARLIER IN THE

00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,278
WEEK ON THE HOPES THAT

90
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,045
OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES WOULD

91
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,447
COME TOGETHER.

00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,381
LET'S CHECK OUT GOLD, WHICH ALSO

93
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,150

SLAMMED, DOWN BY 1.4%.

96
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:21,527
THE THEME OF THE DAY BETWEEN

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,545
IT IS SEEN AS THE MOST SENSITIVE

104
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,615
PAIR.

105
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,250
THIS IS VOLATILITY FOR

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,552
DOLLAR-YEN.

107
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,521
VOLATILITY FOR ONE MONTH, YOUR

WHITE LINE, IS SPIKING PASS THE

109
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,724
THREE MONTH, THE BLUE LINE.

110
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,894
WHY IS THAT?

111
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,596
THE ONE-MONTH CAPTURES THE BOJ

112
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,565
MEETING, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT

113
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:05,238
SPIKE ON MONDAY, THE FIRST DAY

114
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,005
THE BOJ MEETING FELL IN LINE

115
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:10,843
WITH THE CALENDAR.

116
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:15,715
THE ONE WEEK, THE PURPLE LINE,

117
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,718
IS FAIRLY LOW, WHICH PROVES THAT

118
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:19,519
TRADERS ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT

119
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,722
THE BOJ MEETING THAN JANET

120
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,389
YELLEN IN JACKSON HOLE.

121
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,927
JOE: YOU CAN ISOLATE WHAT

122
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:28,594
TRADERS ARE LOOKING AT.

123
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:29,729
IT WILL BE FUN TO LOOK AT THESE

124
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,531
AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE ELECTION

125
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,867
.

126
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,036
I MENTIONED EARLIER OIL

127
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:37,803
SWINGING, AND I SAW THIS GREAT

128
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:41,841
CHART THAT I WANTED TO SHOW.

129
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,377
THESE ARE THE DIFFERENT BEAR AND

130
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,211
BULL MARKETS FOR OIL IN THE LAST

131
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,846

132
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,814
ONE YEAR AGO, A BULL MARKET, 25%

133
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:53,920
IN AUGUST, THEN THIS BIG RED

134
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,822
BAR, A 48% PLUNGE THROUGH

135
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,958
JANUARY, THEN AN 88% RALLY FROM

136
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:03,729
JANUARY TO THE PEAK IN JUNE, AND

137
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,832
A 20% BEAR MARKET FROM JUNE TO

138
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:07,600
EARLY AUGUST, AND NOW ANOTHER

139
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,171
BULL MARKET, 21% UP.

140
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,041
YOU DON'T SEE THAT MANY BULL AND

141
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:15,808
BEAR MARKETS WITHIN ONE YEAR,

142
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:16,842
BUT IT SPEAKS TO HOW DRAMATIC

143
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:21,214
THE SWINGS AND OIL HAVE BEEN.

144
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:28,287

FORECAST IS BELOW WHERE WE ARE,

149
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,231
SO WALL STREET STRATEGISTS

150
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,935
TYPICALLY ARE MORE BULLISH THAN

151
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:48,407
ANY TIME NEAR THE PRESENT, AND

152
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,108
WE ARE TRADING AT 2170 AND

153
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,444

174
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,113

JOE: FOR MORE ON TODAY'S MARKET

190
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:02,007
ACTION, I WANT TO BLING AND --

191
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,477
BRING IN MICHAEL REGAN.

192
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,211
WHAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU?

193
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:10,216
>> THIS TRADING RANGE WE HAVE

194
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,250
BEEN STUCK IN FOREVER IS HOLDING

195
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,220
FIRM, A LITTLE SELLOFF TODAY,

196
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,290
BUT WHILE WE HAVE BEEN STUCK IN

197
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,393
THIS FLAT NARROW TRADING RANGE,

198
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,294
THERE HAS REALLY BEEN A ROTATION

199
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:23,963
GOING ON OVER THE PAST MONTH

200
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:30,436
INTO MORE CYCLICAL INDUSTRIES,

201
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,438
TECHNOLOGY, FINANCIALS,

202
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,205
INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES LEADING,

203
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,740
AND NOT SO MUCH UTILITIES,

204
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,809
CONSUMER STAPLES, HIGH DIVIDEND

205
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,445
STOCKS, SO IT BEGS THE QUESTION.

206
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,580
IS THIS A ROTATION FROM ONE

207
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:50,756
LEADERSHIP TO ANOTHER?

208
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,092
THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE ALL

209
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:53,859
YEAR WITH STRONG CYCLICALS IN

210
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,561
THE LEAD.

211
00:09:55,561 --> 00:10:01,400
MATT: SINCE 1958, S&P 500

212
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,437
DIVIDEND YIELD IS THE HIGHEST IT

213
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:06,405
HAS BEEN RELATIVE TO THE 10 YEAR

214
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,708
YIELD SINCE 1958, THAT WAS

215
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:14,012
BEFORE ANY OF US WERE BORN.

216
00:10:14,012 --> 00:10:17,783
>> IS THE LOWEST THE TREASURY

217
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,319
YIELD HAS BEEN.

218
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,521
MATT: THAT'S TRUE.

219
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:31,630
>> THERE IS THE ANIMAL SPIRITS

220
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,766
OF CHARISMA ABOUT THE ECONOMY.

221
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:38,037
I HAVE BEEN A PESSIMIST.

222
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:38,804
I FELT THESE HIGH VALUATIONS

223
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,040
WOULD MAKE IT TOUGH FOR THE

224
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,774
MARKET TO KEEP RALLYING FROM

225
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,143
HERE.

226
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:44,977
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU

227
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,646
CAN LOOK AT AND SAY THE ECONOMY

228
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,715
IS IMPROVING.

229
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,084
ONE OF THE THINGS IS THE ATLANTA

230
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:52,651
FED GDP FORECAST.

231
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,687
SCARLET: IT SHOT UP RECENTLY.

232
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:59,859
>> YEAH, 3.6% NOW.

233
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:04,964
GROWTH IN THE SECOND QUARTER WAS

234
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:05,731
HAMSTRUNG A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE

235
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,434
OF INVENTORIES.

236
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,268
SO MAYBE THIS IS A BOUNCE BACK

237
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,972
FROM THAT.

238
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,608
IT IS SURPRISING TO SEE THAT

239
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,408
STRONG GROWTH FORECAST FROM THE

240
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:16,842
ATLANTA FED.

241
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:21,213
MATT: HOW ACCURATE IS THE

242
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:21,981
ATLANTA GDP FED AS A PREDICTOR

243
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:22,448
OF REAL GDP?

244
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,150
>> THE CONSENSUS WE TRACK IS

245
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,921
LESS THAN HALF OF THAT, SO WE

246
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:29,722
WILL HAVE TO SEE WHO IS RIGHT,

247
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:30,756
BUT THE LATEST REPORTS BEING

248
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:35,094
THAT STRONG, TO HAVE THAT

249
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:35,828
INDICATOR LOOK AT HEALTHY.

250
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:40,666
MATT: SINCE IT IS PART OF THE

251
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,500
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK SYSTEM, DO

252
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,368
THEY HAVE TO BE MORE OPTIMISTIC?

253
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,538
SCARLET: DO THEY HAVE TO ATTACH

254
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:47,172
MORE WEIGHT TO IT?

255
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:51,710
>> IT'S BASED MORE ON THE DATA

256
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,013
AS IT COMES IN RATHER THAN A

257
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,981
CENTRAL BANKER MAKING A

258
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,316
FORECAST.

259
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,719
IT HAS SHOWN A MORE PLASTIC VIEW

260
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,022
-- MORE PESSIMISTIC VIEW IN

261
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:03,756
OTHER TIMES IN THE CYCLE.

262
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:08,427
SCARLET: THIS IS MORE AN

263
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,462
INDICATOR OF THE OVERALL ECONOMY

264
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:11,330
BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JOB

265
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:11,830
GROWTH THERE.

266
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,264
>> I AGREE.

267
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,401
THIS REPORT YESTERDAY IS

268
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,469
FASCINATING FOR SEVERAL REASONS.

269
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:22,908
HOME SALES JUMPED 12%,

270
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,512
HIGHEST SINCE 2007.

271
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,581
TO ME IT IS A REASON TO BE VERY

272
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:32,051
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE ECONOMY,

273
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,919
NOT JUST HOMEBUILDERS, BUT THE

274
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,820
OVERALL ECONOMY IN GENERAL.

275
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,689
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HOME

276
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:41,861
OWNERSHIP RATE, IT'S LOWEST

277
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,728
SINCE 1965.

278
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,864

281
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,904
IT IS ALL DEMOGRAPHIC.

282
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:55,774
I LOOKED UP THE AVERAGE HOME --

283
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,508
FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYER AGE, 33

284
00:12:56,508 --> 00:13:00,246
YEARS OLD.

285
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,046
IRONICALLY THAT WAS THE AGE I

286
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:05,818
BOUGHT MY FIRST HOME AT.

287
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:11,123

UNATTENDED CONSEQUENCE.

377

COUNTRY TOGETHER, THE OPPOSITION

381
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,542

383
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,813
IMPACT ON THE MARKET.

384
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,283
AT THE SAME TIME, THE ECONOMY IN

00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,217
TURKEY IS NOT THAT BAD.

386
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:18,556

388
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:24,129
RESPONSIBLE FISCALLY.

389
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,598
IT'S NOT A SURPRISE THAT WE HAVE

402
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,538
THE BALANCE JUST RIGHT?

403
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:11,443
THE FISCAL STORY IS IMPORTING,

404
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,445
AND THE IMPACT OF THE COUP ON

405
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,212

MONTHS, A FEW WEEKS AGO, VERY

425
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:08,633
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE RULING

426
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,202
ANC.

427
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,004
IT COULD GO EITHER WAY.

428
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:18,977
MUCH MORE CONCILIATORY OR DOUBLE

429
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,014

430
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,283
CHOSEN THE LATTER, AND THAT TO

431
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:28,353
ME IS A DANGEROUS PATH.

SCARLET: THE FINANCE MINISTER

433
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:35,327
MIGHT BE KEY TO EVERYTHING HERE.

434
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:43,669
ANOTHER FINANCE MINISTER HAS

435
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,536
MADE A COMMENT SAYING HIS ARREST

436
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,606
COULD BE MORE DAMAGING.

437
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:48,440
IT COULD DESTROY THE ECONOMY.

438
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,309
JOE: COULD IT BE THAT BAD?

439
00:21:51,309 --> 00:22:00,185
>> DRAMATIC, BUT NONETHELESS THE

440
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,152
ANCHOR HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE

00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:02,521
AUTONOMY OF THE FISCAL

IF YOU START PLAYING WITH THAT,

444
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:06,591
THAT BECOMES A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

445
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:11,096

WE HAVE UPDATED IT.

HAVING SAID THAT, IT IS CLEAR TO

00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,238
ME THE MARKET HAS RUN OUT OF

476
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:43,842

477
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,576
THE RALLY IN THE EMERGING

THE MARKET IS STARTING TO FEEL

483
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:05,263
THAT TECHNICALLY IT IS NOT AS

484
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:08,433
SUPPORTIVE AS BEFORE.

485
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,870
DO WE THINK THE RALLY HAS LEGS

486
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,641
HERE AFTER CONSOLIDATION?

487
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,643
I THINK THE CONTEXT FOR EMERGING

00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,379

AT ETF'S ON THE BLOOMBERG.

494
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:36,728
I LOOKED AT THE EMERGING MARKET

495
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,863
ETF'S, COVERING EVERYTHING FROM

496
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:45,170

501
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,247
IT SEEM LIKE A NO-BRAINER AT THE

00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,048
BEGINNING OF THIS RALLY TO GET

503
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,651

504
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,586
WE HAD ALL BANKS ON THE SELL

SIDE ADVISING CLIENTS TO DO

506
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,654
THAT.

507
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,722
IS THAT ALSO A NO-BRAINER TO

508
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:05,790
TAKE SOME MONEY OFF THE TABLE AT

509
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,692
THIS POINT?

510
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,695
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

511
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,898
WE AS THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS ARE

00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,834

COMFORTABLE WITH THAT POSITION

514
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,105

516
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,076

THEY HAVE PRODUCED ONLY MORE

00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,696
MORE JOBLESSNESS, AND BROKEN

617
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,377
THERE IS A LACK OF OF AFFORDABLE

618
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,144
HOUSING IN PALO ALTO DRIVING

619
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:33,811
RESIDENTS AWAY.

FRANCISCO BAY AREA COMMUNITY HAS

622
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,051
THE WORST HOUSING POLICY IN THE

623
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:48,425
U.S. 

624
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:49,193
THANK YOU FOR JOINING AS.

625
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,029
YOU RECENTLY RESIGNED AND

626
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:56,467
DECIDED TO LEAVE PALO ALTO

627
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,301
BECAUSE OF YOUR $6,200 A MONTH

628
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,169
SHARED RENT.

629
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:02,273
WHY IS THE CITY UNWILLING TO

630
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:02,840
ADDRESS THE ISSUE?

631
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,745
>> OUR PROBLEM WITH HOUSING IS

632
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,179
THAT WE HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY

633
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,414
ADDED FAR MORE JOBS THAN HOUSING

634
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:11,581
FOR DECADES.

635
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:12,449
WE HAVE THE LARGEST IMBALANCE IN

636
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:17,855
THE NATION WITH THREE JOBS FOR

637
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:18,656
EVERY HOUSING UNIT IN PALO ALTO.

638
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:22,760
BECAUSE OF THE IMBALANCE AND

639
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,594
REGIONAL SHORTAGE IN THE AREA,

640
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,563
HOUSING PRICES SPIRALING OUT OF

641
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:25,996
CONTROL.

642
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:28,232
SCARLET: WHAT I FOUND

643
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,402
FASCINATING IS THE PALO ALTO

644
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,036
MAYOR'S COMMENTS.

645
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,371
WE ARE LOOKING TO INCREASE THEIR

646
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:36,340
RATE OF HOUSING GROWTH, BUT

647
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,708
DECREASE THE RATE OF JOB GROWTH.

648
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,244
THIS DOES NOT MEAN WE WANT NO

649
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:45,750
JOB GROWTH.

650
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,516
WE WANT ME TO JOB GROWTH AND

651
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:47,652
METERED HOUSING GROWTH.

652
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:54,257
JOE: IS THAT A REASONABLE POINT,

653
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,860
THAT EVEN IF YOU WERE TO ADD

654
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,628
MORE HOUSING IN PALO ALTO THAT

655
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,630
IT WOULD CREATE A HUGE'S STRESS

656
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,668
ON THAT TRANSPORTATION

657
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:04,969
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE PROBLEM

658
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:05,770
WOULD SHOW UP A DIFFERENT WAY?

659
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,773
>> YOU NEED TO DO BOTH, AT

660
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,741
HOUSING AND INVEST IN PUBLIC

661
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,309
TRANSPORTATION.

662
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:16,681
MATT: IT IS ODD TO HEAR A MAYOR

663
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:17,515
SUGGESTED THAT HE WANTS TO LIMIT

664
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,117
JOB GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY HE

665
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,919
RUNS.

666
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:26,090
I DON'T THINK I HAVE EVER HEARD

667
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:26,891
ANY OTHER POLITICIANS SAY THEY

668
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:30,128
WANT TO HOLD JOB GROWTH BACK.

669
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,962
ON THE OTHER HAND, I CAN

670
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:33,497
UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD NOT WANT

671
00:35:33,497 --> 00:35:34,098
TO PUT STRESS ON THE

672
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:35,299
INFRASTRUCTURE.

673
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,903
IS TRAFFIC VERY HEAVY?

674
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:39,670
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO GET

675
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,371
AROUND IF YOU ADDED MORE

676
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:40,738
HOUSING?

677
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:44,775
>> I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT

678
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,577
IT TAKES SMART PLANNING AND A

679
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:49,480
DESIRE TO MAKE THOSE PLANS.

680
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,381
LOOK AT WHO IS ON OUR CITY

681
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:54,218
COUNCIL.

682
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,787
THEY ARE EITHER INDEPENDENTLY

683
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,588
WEALTHY AND DON'T NEED TO WORK

684
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:58,289
OR RETIRED.

685
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,024
YOU HAVE A MAYOR WHO BOUGHT A

686
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:03,094
HOUSE FOR LESS THAN $500,000,

687
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,128
BUT NOW IT'S WORTH MORE THAN $4

688
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,296
MILLION.

689
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,698
THEY DON'T NEED JOBS ANYMORE.

690
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:08,332
THEY ARE RICH ENOUGH.

691
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,568
JOE: THIS IS THE POINT I WANTED

692
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,404
TO ASK YOU ABOUT.

693
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,974
FROM YOUR TIME ON THE PLANNING

694
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:17,675
COMMISSION, WHAT IS THEIR

695
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,376
MOTIVATION FOR THE LACK OF

696
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,610
HOUSING?

697
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,780
IS IT JUST PERSONAL AND TRYSTS,

698
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,547
THAT THEIR REAL ESTATE VALUES

699
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:24,649
HAVE SURGE?

700
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,151
OR IS THERE TALK ABOUT

701
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:27,952
PRESERVING THE STATE OF THE

702
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,553
COMMUNITY AND NOT CHANGING MUCH,

703
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:32,290
DOES THAT HOLD WATER?

704
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,090
WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ABOUT THEIR

705
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:33,758
REAL MOTIVATION HERE?

706
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,827
>> I THINK THE FIRST ONE IS AS

707
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:42,333
YOU HAVE OUT LINE, THE HOUSING

708
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,167
SHORTAGE PROPS UP PEOPLE'S

709
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:43,667
HOUSING PRICES.

710
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:45,903
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT

711
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,973
HOUSES FOR $100,000 AND THEY'RE

712
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:53,144
NOW WORTH MORE THAN $3 MILLION

713
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,245
OR $4 MILLION.

714
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:58,416
THEY DID NOT EARN THAT MONEY.

715
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,250
THEY BOUGHT INTO THAT MARKET AND

716
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,152
ENACTED THE POLICIES TO KEEP

717
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,722
THOSE PRICES HIGH.

718
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,489
WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD DO

719
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:10,060
SOMETHING ABOUT IT, DEFINITELY.

720
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,895
MOST OF PALO ALTO IS ONE STORY

721
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,530
OR TWO-STORY STRUCTURES.

722
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,431
WE HAVE PARKING LOTS, STRIP

723
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,735
MALLS.

724
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,569
THERE ARE PLACES TO GROW AND GO

725
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,805
NEAR EXISTING PUBLIC TRANSIT

726
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,307
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO GROW IN A

727
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,074
WAY THAT WOULD HAVE THE LEAST

728
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:25,876
HARMFUL IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY,

729
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,512
BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE DOING IT

730
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:29,213
BECAUSE IT IS PROPPING UP

731
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:32,750
HOUSING PRICES, AND NUMBER TWO,

732
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,551
THEY WANT TO KEEP LIVING IN THE

733
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:33,918
SUBURB.

734
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,585
GO AHEAD.

735
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:42,393
MATT: IS IT OK FOR A COMMUNITY

736
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,260
TO COLLECTIVELY SAY WE DON'T

737
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,362
WANT TO GET ANY BIGGER, WE DON'T

738
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:47,331
WANT TO INCREASE OUR POPULATION,

739
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,632
WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A MORE

740
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:49,099
DENSE AREA?

741
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:53,037
>> I THINK IT IS FAIR FOR A

742
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:53,771
COMMUNITY THAT IS NOT A JOB

743
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,740
CENTER.

744
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,042
I DON'T THINK IT IS FAIR FOR A

745
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:02,480
COMMUNITY THAT HAS PURPOSELY

746
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,115
INVITED LOTS OF FORTUNE 500

747
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:04,782
COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH

748
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,016
HEADQUARTERS IN THEIR CITY AND

749
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:06,851
THEN TO SAY WE WILL TAKE THE TAX

750
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:10,087
REVENUE, BUT WOULD NOT DO

751
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:10,921
ANYTHING TO HOUSE YOUR WORKERS.

752
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:15,026
JOE: HERE IS SOME PUSHBACK.

753
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:20,931
SCARLET: A BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTOR

754
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:25,135
WRITES "MOST CITIES DON'T HAVE A

755
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:26,270
SHORTAGE OF HOUSING, JUST IN

756
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,071
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE

757
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,073
WANT TO LIVE.

758
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:34,178
POLICY THAT CAN CONSTRAIN

759
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:34,845
DEVELOPMENT AND THE MORE

760
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,180
DEVELOPED PARTS OF CITIES CAN

761
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,981
FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT IN LESS

762
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:42,486
DEVELOPED NEIGHBORHOODS."

763
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:48,392
JOE: IS IT POSSIBLE THAT PALO

764
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,961
ALTO'S REFUSAL TO BUILD MORE

765
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,396
HOUSING IS A DE FACTO SUBSIDY TO

766
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,230
HELP OTHER AREAS GROW THAT NEED

767
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:53,931
THAT KIND OF GROWTH AND

768
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:54,832
POPULATION INFLOW?

769
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:59,336
>> I WOULD NOT SEE IT AS A

770
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,504
SUBSIDY.

771
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,674
I WOULD SEE IT AS A COST.

772
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,441
WE ARE A TECH OF IN SILICON

773
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:06,243
VALLEY.

774
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:12,316
-- TECH HUB IN SILICON VALLEY.

775
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:16,053
IT MAKES SINCE TO LOCATE NEXT TO

776
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:16,654
A RESEARCH UNIVERSITY,

777
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,389
INVESTORS.

778
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,491
WHEN PEOPLE ARE PUSHED INTO

779
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,393
AREAS THAT ARE NOT HUBS IN THAT

780
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,595
WAY, IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

781
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:28,132
COMPANIES TO SET UP SHOP, GROW,

782
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,301
FIND INVESTORS, FIND EMPLOYEES,

783
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,571
SO WHEN YOU PUSH OUT PEOPLE AND

784
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,773
CONSEQUENCES PUSH COMPANIES AWAY

785
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,540
FROM THAT ECOSYSTEM THAT MAKES

786
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,977
THEM THRIVE, EVERY ONE OF THOSE

787
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:40,778
COMPANIES IS THAT MUCH HARDER TO

788
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:41,612
START.

789
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:45,215
THAT MEANS IT'S HARDER TO START

790
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:46,050
NEW COMPANIES AND HARDER TO ADD

791
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,483
MORE JOBS.

792
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:50,755
JOE: DO YOU HAVE ANY OPTIMISM

793
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,456
THAT ANYWHERE IN THE BAY AREA

794
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,692
THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO IMPROVE

795
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,726
OR IS YOUR VIEW THAT THIS FIGHT

796
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,861
WILL GO ON FOREVER WITHOUT ANY

797
00:39:57,861 --> 00:39:58,462
MEANINGFUL CHANGE?

798
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:02,633
>> THE ONLY MEANINGFUL CHANGE WE

799
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,001
CAN HOPE FOR IS THAT THE STATE

800
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,237
AND FEDERAL LEVEL.

801
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,071
EVERY CITY WILL CONTINUE TO ADD

802
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,574
MORE JOBS BECAUSE IT TAXES --

803
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,842
INCREASES TAX REVENUE.

804
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:15,879
JOE: THANK YOU.

805
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:16,413
FASCINATING STORY.

806
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:20,918
SCARLET: COMING UP, NIGEL FARAGE

807
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,921
WILL APPEAR ON STAGE TONIGHT

808
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:29,759
WITH THE DONALD TRUMP.

809
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:30,628
WE EXAMINE BREXIT AND THE DONALD

810
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:31,228
TRUMP CONNECTION.

811
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:31,762
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

812
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,029
â™ª

813
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:54,838
SCARLET: OF GAMESTOP HAVE RISEN

814
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,841
MORE THAN 20% SINCE JUNE.

815
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:00,844
THE NUMBERS TELL A DIFFERENT

816
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:06,150
STORY A BIG REASON IS POKEMON

817
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:13,490
GO.

818
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,358
GAMESTOP IS CAPITALIZING ON THAT

819
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,593
CRAZE WITH MORE THAN 400 STORES

820
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:18,996
YOUR MARK AS STOPS.

821
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:28,738
SALES WERE HIGHER -- YEAR MARCH

822
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:29,473
WITH SONY, MICROSOFT, AND

823
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:34,077
NINTENDO READY TO RELEASE NEW

824
00:43:34,077 --> 00:43:35,846
CONSULS, LOOK FOR A PICKUP IN

825
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:41,351
DEVELOPERS.

826
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:43,520
IN THE MEANTIME, GAMESTOP IS

827
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,288
OFFSETTING A DECLINE IN NEW

828
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:49,259
VIDEO GAME SALES BY DIVERSE --

829
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:57,600
DIVERSIFYING.

830
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,506
GAMESTOP HAS MANAGED TO AVOID

831
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:03,440
 AVOID CONSECUTIVE

832
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:10,880
DECLINES.

833
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,682
NOT EVERYONE BELIEVES THAT NEW

834
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:15,018
CONSULS, VIRTUAL-REALITY, AND A

835
00:44:15,018 --> 00:44:16,453
CONNECTION TO AT&T COULD TURN

836
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,756
THE TIDE.

837
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:19,723
GAMESTOP WAS THE MOST SHORTED

838
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:24,028
STOCK LAST YEAR.

839
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:24,795
IT REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST

840
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:25,529
SHORTED STOCKS.

841
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:29,199
WE WILL WATCH HOW THESE TRENDS

842
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,234
PLAY OUT AFTER RESULTS ON

843
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:30,701
THURSDAY.

844
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,569
MATT: "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"

845
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:36,707
AT A RALLY IN TAMPA, FLORIDA,

846
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:41,445
DONALD TRUMP SLAMMED HILLARY

847
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:42,246
CLINTON FOR THE CONTROVERSY

848
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:43,013
SURROUNDING HER FAMILY'S

849
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:43,714
FOUNDATION.

850
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,116
HE ACCUSED HER OF COVERING UP A

851
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:46,717
PAY FOR PLAY SCHEME.

852
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:50,020
>> WE ARE GOING TO END THE

853
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,789
GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION.

854
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,924
HILLARY CLINTON RAN THE STATE

855
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,692
DEPARTMENT LIKE A FAILED LEADER

856
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,061
IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY.

857
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,129
SHE SOLD FAVORS.

858
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,266
SHE SOLD ACCESS.

859
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,268
AND WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE WHAT IS

860
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,970
REVEALED, ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE.

861
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,072
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE 50% OF THE

862
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:12,109
PEOPLE WHO SAW HER MADE

863
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:12,843
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CLINTON

864
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:13,343
FOUNDATION.

865
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:19,182
MATT: JOINING US WITH MORE,

866
00:45:19,182 --> 00:45:19,950
MARGARET, DONALD TRUMP WILL IN

867
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,719
THE GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION --

868
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,656
THAT IS A WEIGHT OFF MY CHEST --

869
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:26,390
HOW IS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN

870
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:26,790
REACTING?

871
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,427
>> THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AFTER

872
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:31,094
TAKING ITS TIME TO GET A

873
00:45:31,094 --> 00:45:34,131
STATEMENT TOGETHER CAME OUT WITH

874
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,866
A STRONG STATEMENT SAYING THAT

875
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:38,268
THE STORY DONALD TRUMP IS

876
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:42,539
REFERRING TO, THE ONE THAT

877
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,273
ALLEGES HALF OF HER MEETINGS

878
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:46,577
WERE WITH FOUNDATION DONORS,

879
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,179
RELIES ON UTTERLY FLAWED DATA

880
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,013
AND CHERRY PICKS FROM A LIMITED

881
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:50,814
SUBSET OF INFORMATION ABOUT HER

882
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,984
MEETINGS.

883
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:54,851
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS GONE ON

884
00:45:54,851 --> 00:45:57,521
TO SAY THAT SHE MET WITH CLOSE

885
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:00,657
TO 2000 FOLKS CONNECTED WITH

886
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:04,594
VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AND

887
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:05,362
THOSE NUMBERS WERE NOT COUNTED

888
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:09,333
AS PART OF THE REPORT.

889
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,100
OTHERS DEFENDING THE CLINTON

890
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,968
FOUNDATION SAYING THE FOUNDATION

891
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:14,772
HAS THOUSANDS OF DONORS AND ONLY

892
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,907
SEVERAL DOZEN OF THEM GOT

893
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:17,708
MEETINGS WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS

894
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:18,275
SECRETARY OF STATE.

895
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:22,879
THEY ARE PUSHING BACK, BUT A LOT

896
00:46:22,879 --> 00:46:23,781
OF HER PROBLEMS WITH TRUSTING

897
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,750
CREDIBILITY ARE BAKED IN THE

898
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,153
CAKE, AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS

899
00:46:30,153 --> 00:46:30,954
HOPING TO DO IS TAKE ADVANTAGE

900
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,924
OF THAT AND LET VOTERS GET LOST

901
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,793
IN THE DETAILS.

902
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,363
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS,

903
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:40,263
BUT HERE'S ANOTHER REASON NOT TO

904
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:40,664
TRUST HER.

905
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:45,335
JOE: I WANTED TO  ASK

906
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,170
EXACTLY ABOUT THAT.

907
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,106
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DETAILS, IS

908
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,507
THERE ANYTHING THAT SHE DID THAT

909
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:51,174
LOOKS LIKE PAY TO PLAY?

910
00:46:51,174 --> 00:46:58,915
>> THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

911
00:46:58,915 --> 00:46:59,549
E-MAILS THAT THE STATE

912
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:00,283
DEPARTMENT IS GOING OVER AND

913
00:47:00,283 --> 00:47:01,051
WILL BE RELEASED BETWEEN NOW AND

914
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:04,821
NOVEMBER, BUT THE RECENT BATCH

915
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:11,395
SHOWS THE APPEARANCE OF ACCESS.

916
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,129
IF YOU ARE ACTIVE WITH THE

917
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,564
CLINTON FOUNDATION, THEN THERE

918
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:17,100
WERE TOP-LEVEL CLINTON AIDES

919
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,702
TALKING TO EACH OTHER SAYING

920
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:19,503
MAYBE THIS PERSON WOULD LIKE TO

921
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,871
MEET WITH HER.

922
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:21,705
BUT DID THAT ACCESS TRANSLATE

923
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:26,743
INTO FAVORS OVER IS THAT THE OLD

924
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:29,646
WASHINGTON STAND BY, TO HAVE AN

925
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,715
EAR TO GET THEIR FOOT IN THE

926
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,418
DOOR, NOT THAT EITHER ONE OF

927
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:34,951
THEM IS GREAT.

928
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:40,590
MATT: AT THIS POINT, IT IS AN

929
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,158
IMPORTANT POINT.

930
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,794
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

931
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:50,167
ACCESS AND ACTUAL FAVORS, WHICH

932
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:50,934
WOULD BE THE ETHICAL PROBLEM.

933
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:57,374
THERE IS NOT AN ETHICAL PROBLEM

934
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,041
WITH GETTING TO MEET THE

935
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:58,809
SECRETARY OF STATE, IS THERE?

936
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,944
>> THE PROBLEM FOR HILLARY

937
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,713
CLINTON IS THAT EVERY MINUTE SHE

938
00:48:03,713 --> 00:48:05,382
AND HER CAMPAIGN DEFEND THIS ART

939
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:16,393
TRY DECIDE -- TRY 2-D SIDE

940
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,294
WHETHER TO DEFEND IT, THAT'S A

941
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:22,866
LOST OPPORTUNITY.

942
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,568
THE HEAT IS OFF OF HIM AS LONG

943
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,671
AS HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT THIS.

944
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:32,209
LET'S TALK ABOUT NIGEL FARAGE.

945
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:32,976
HE WILL BE VISITING A RALLY IN

946
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:36,680
MISSISSIPPI.

947
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,414
HE IS THE LEADER OF THE UK

948
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,216
INDEPENDENCE PARTY THAT PUSH FOR

949
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:42,052
BREXIT.

950
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:45,455
SHOULD WE EXPECT AN ENDORSEMENT?

951
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:50,961
>> EXPECTATION IS HE WILL STOP

952
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,163
SHORT OF AN ENDORSEMENT.

953
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:56,032
HE TOLD THE LOCAL STATION IN

954
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:56,967
MISSISSIPPI THAT YOU COULD NOT

955
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,369
PAY HIM TO VOTE FOR HILLARY

956
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:02,639
CLINTON, WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE

957
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,340
HE SHOULD PROBABLY NOT BE

958
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,442
CASTING VOTES.

959
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:10,881
BECAUSE HE HIMSELF IS THE ONE

960
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:11,681
MAKING THIS POINT TO THE LOCAL

961
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:14,217
STATIONS, NOT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

962
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,585
, SOME CONFUSION FROM THE TRUNK

963
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,521
CAMPAIGN WHETHER THIS WAS

964
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:18,321
HAPPENING AND THEY WOULD APPEAR

965
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:18,989
TOGETHER.

966
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:19,823
WE WILL SEE MORE IN THE HOURS TO

967
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:20,223
COME.

968
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,626
JOE: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

969
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,863
SCARLET: SHOPPERS IN HONG KONG

970
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:27,664
WERE WAITING FOR UP TO TWO HOURS

971
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,667
IN LINE FOR A PERSONALIZED JAR

972

OF NEW TELE-.

973
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:34,938
HOW DOES IS HELP SLUMPING SALES

974
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:35,438
IN THE CITY?

975
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:35,972
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

976
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:36,239
â™ª

977
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,214
SCARLET: I AM SCARLET FU.

978
00:51:58,214 --> 00:52:01,885
"WHAT'D YOU MISS?"

979
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:02,585
WAITING FOR TWO HOURS FOR

980
00:52:02,585 --> 00:52:09,559
CUSTOMIZED JARS OF NUTELLA.

981
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,062
SALES HAVE DECLINED, SO POP-UP

982
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:12,862
STORES ARE TRYING TO BRING BACK

983
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:17,634
FOOT TRAFFIC, AND THE LURE OF A

984
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:21,738
BOTTLE OF NUTELLA IS ATTRACTING

985
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,940
CUSTOMERS.

986
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,776
YOU USED TO LIVE IN HONG KONG.

987
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:32,048
>> PANIC AND THAT FEELING OF

988
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:34,885
MISSING OUT SPREADS REALLY

989
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,987
QUICKLY IN THE HARBOR CITY OF

990
00:52:37,987 --> 00:52:41,424
HONG KONG.

991
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:42,959
POP-UP STORES HAVE BECOME AN

992
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:44,894
INTERESTING WAY FOR RETAILERS IN

993
00:52:44,894 --> 00:52:49,499
HONG KONG TO GENERATE THAT FEAR

994
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,167
OF MISSING OUT AND GENERATE

995
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:54,437
SALES TO MATCH.

996
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:55,271
NUTELLA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF

997
00:52:55,271 --> 00:52:58,308
THAT.

998
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,543
NIKE AND OTHER BRANDS HAVE

999
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,378
STARTED TO DO THIS BECAUSE SALES

1000
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:05,548
HAVE SLUMPED 416 STRAIGHT

1001
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:06,583
MONTHS.

1002
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,318
WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH POP-UP

1003
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:12,922
STORES, BUT THAT IS NOT A

1004
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:14,524
CONCEPT IN HONG KONG OR PARTS OF

1005
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,693
ASIA, SO THIS IS JUST BECOMING

1006
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:17,193
SOMETHING NEW.

1007
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:23,099
SCARLET: THAT'S BECAUSE ALL THE

1008
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:23,867
MALLS ARE STOCKED WITH LUXURY

1009
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:24,534
NAMEBRAND PRODUCTS.

1010
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,672
>> FALLING MAINLAND TOURIST

1011
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:32,475
NUMBERS HAVE MADE IT SO THAT

1012
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,243
THOSE STORES HAVE CLOSED UP

1013
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:36,379
BRANCHES, SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF

1014
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,080
VACANCIES AT THESE MALLS.

1015
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,817
>> THE MALLS HAVE DONE BETTER

1016
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:43,653
THAN THE STREET, THE STORES ON

1017
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:46,523
THE HONG KONG STREET, BUT THERE

1018
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:50,093
IS SUFFERING ALL AROUND.

1019
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:50,927
YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.

1020
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:55,899
CHINESE TOURISTS, AS SIGNIFICANT

1021
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,935
DECLINE, DOWN 11% IN THE FIRST

1022
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:03,973
HALF OF THE YEAR, SO THESE

1023
00:54:03,973 --> 00:54:05,208
MAINLANDERS WHO LIKE LUXURY

1024
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:05,975
BRANDS AND BUY THEM HAVE BEEN

1025
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:06,876
MISSING FROM THE ECONOMY.

1026
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:12,348
JOE: I'VE JUST MADE THIS CHART

1027
00:54:12,348 --> 00:54:13,149
THAT SHOWS THE ISSUE, THE WHITE

1028
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:18,455
LINE IS THE YUAN VERSUS THE HONG

1029
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:18,988
KONG DOLLAR.

1030
00:54:18,988 --> 00:54:23,293
THERE HAS BEEN A BIG LUNCH --

1031
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:29,432
BIG PLUNGE.

1032
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:34,938
IF YOU HAVE A BIG TICKET SPLURGE

1033
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,173
, IT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO GO

1034
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,476
TO EUROPE THAN HONG KONG IF YOU

1035
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:40,210
ARE GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF

1036
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:40,610
MONEY.

1037
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:45,381
>> WE DID SEE AFTER BREXIT THAT

1038
00:54:45,381 --> 00:54:49,486
THE NUMBER OF CHINESE CLICKING

1039
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:52,522
ONLINE SURGED BECAUSE THEY WERE

1040
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:58,261
ALL THINKING I CAN GO TO EUROPE

1041
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,662
NOW OR THE U.K. AND BUY GOODS

1042
00:54:59,662 --> 00:55:00,196
FOR 20% CHEAPER.

1043
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:03,500
SCARLET: WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS

1044
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,636
NEW TELE-STORY, I THOUGHT OF

1045
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,606
COURSE IT IS IN HONG KONG.

1046
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:14,511
-- THIS NUTELLA STORY, I THOUGHT

1047
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,914
IT IS AND HANG KONG.

1048
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:24,520
YOU LIVED IN HONG KONG.

1049
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,288
REMEMBER WHEN BAKERIES WOULD

1050
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:26,089
FACE A RUN ON COUPONS BECAUSE

1051
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:27,757
THEY THOUGHT THE BAKERY WAS

1052
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:28,291
GOING TO CLOSE?

1053
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,793
>> MY FAVORITE STORY WAS

1054
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:41,137
PORTUGUESE EGG CARDS -- CARTS.

1055
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:41,938
I REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE WOULD

1056
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,641
LINEUP AROUND BLOCKS TO GET

1057
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:49,979
THEIR HANDS ON THESE PORTUGUESE

1058
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:59,054
TARTS.

1059
00:55:59,054 --> 00:56:05,962
MATT: WE HEAR MORE ABOUT THESE

1060
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:06,796
FANS TAKING OFF AND GAINING SO

1061
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,798
MUCH STEAM, THEN JUST DROPPING

1062
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,900
IN HONG KONG, CHINA.

1063
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:15,038
>> CUPCAKE.

1064
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:19,175
MATT: I'M NOT A FAN.

1065
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:19,876
I LIKE THE WHOLE CAKE.

1066
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,078
