1
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:08,782
>> Laura: IMAGINE THIS FLYING

2
00:00:08,783 --> 00:00:09,749
ANYWHERE ELSE.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,151
LAST NIGHT DON LEMON THOUGHT IT

4
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:13,186
WAS HILARIOUS WHEN GUESTS ON HIS

5
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:15,989
SHOW MARKED KANYE WEST'S

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,225
INTELLIGENCE AHEAD OF THE

7
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:18,992
RAPPERS MEETING WITH

8
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:20,193
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THURSDAY,

9
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:20,594
TOMORROW.

10
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:22,229
AND IT WAS DONE IN THE MOST

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,133
OFFENSIVE WAY POSSIBLE.

12
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:27,167
WATCH.

13
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:28,201
>> KANYE WEST IS WHAT HAPPENS

14
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:30,170
WHEN THEY DON'T READ IT, AND WE

15
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:31,671
HAVE THIS NOW AND NOW

16
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:32,372
DONALD TRUMP WILL USE IT AND

17
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:34,808
PERVERTED AND HE WILL HAVE

18
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:37,577
SOMEONE THAT CAN STAND WITH HIM

19
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:38,578
AND TAKE PICTURES.

20
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,981
>> AND HE IS AN ATTENTION OR

21
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:41,982
LIKE THE PRESIDENT.

22
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:43,216
HE'S ALL OF A SUDDEN A MODEL

23
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:46,219
SPOKESPERSON, HE IS THE TOKEN OF

24
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,787
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

25
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:48,755
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

26
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:50,390
NO ONE SHOULD BE TAKING

27
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:52,025
KANYE WEST SERIOUSLY.

28
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:54,127
HE CLEARLY HAS ISSUES, HE'S

29
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:55,962
ALREADY BEEN HOSPITALIZED.

30
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:57,597
>> Laura: IS JOINING ME WITH

31
00:00:57,598 --> 00:01:00,967
THE REACTION OWENS, AND IT

32
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:03,937
REALLY TURNS OUT THAT THEY

33
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,106
CANNOT ACCEPT ANYONE WHO

34
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:10,577
DISAGREES WITH THEM WHO HAS ANY

35
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:12,179
AFFINITY FOR OR ANY AGREEMENT

36
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,046
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

37
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:16,983
WHO IS THE INTOLERANT ONE NOW,

38
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:17,317
CANDACE?

39
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:19,986
>> IF THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY

40
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:20,387
INTOLERANT.

41
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:21,788
BUT MOST ESPECIALLY TO ADD TO

42
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,790
YOUR STATEMENT, MOST ESPECIALLY

43
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:24,291
BLACK PEOPLE.

44
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,593
THE DEMOCRATS RELY ON OUR VOTE.

45
00:01:26,594 --> 00:01:28,828
IF THEY SECURED 85% OF OUR VOTE,

46
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,764
THEY WOULD LOSE.

47
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:31,831
THEY WOULD ACHIEVE MORE THAN 85%

48
00:01:31,832 --> 00:01:35,702
OF THE BLACK VOTE TO SUSTAIN

49
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:39,773
THEIR PARTY, AND WHAT THEY SAID

50
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:42,342
LAST NIGHT WAS NOT ONLY RACIST

51
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:43,009
BUT ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE.

52
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,646
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WOULD BE

53
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:47,714
ALLOWED ON ANY NETWORK, LEAST OF

54
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:50,383
ALL HAVE A HOST OF LAUGHING AS

55
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:50,850
IF IT'S FUNNY.

56
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:52,185
>> Laura: THE ENTIRE PANEL

57
00:01:52,186 --> 00:01:54,221
KIND OF WENT ON WITH THAT.

58
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:55,388
IMAGINE IF A CONSERVATIVE HOST

59
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:56,590
HAD A GUEST ON THAT SAID

60
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:58,825
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND LEFT?

61
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:00,193
THERE WOULD BE CALLS FOR

62
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:00,660
BOYCOTTS.

63
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:03,997
I GOT IN TROUBLE WITH LeBRON

64
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,365
JAMES, I WAS JUST TEASING HIM,

65
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:07,767
AND HE SAID, YOU CAN'T SAY --

66
00:02:07,768 --> 00:02:08,735
IT'S LIKE YOU CAN'T JOKE BUT

67
00:02:08,735 --> 00:02:10,636
THEY CAN SAY THE MOST HORRIFIC

68
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:13,974
THINGS POSSIBLE AND, YOU ARE

69
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:14,808
SHUT DOWN.

70
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:17,544
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, THOUGH, FOR

71
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:19,179
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY?

72
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,381
I THINK THEY ARE WORRIED, ARE

73
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:22,749
THEY NOT, CANDACE?

74
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,017
YOU'VE BROKEN THROUGH IN YOUR

75
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,652
OWN WAY IN POLITICS, YOU HAVE

76
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:28,388
KIND OF COME ONTO THE SCENE, AND

77
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:31,958
THERE ARE OTHERS COMING FORWARD

78
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:32,759
SAYING, THE DEMONIZATION OF

79
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,994
DONALD TRUMP AND THE

80
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:35,028
REPUBLICANS, THE ECONOMY IS

81
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,162
DOING WELL -- OF THE MARKET IS

82
00:02:36,163 --> 00:02:38,198
DOWN TODAY BUT THIS KIND OF

83
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,632
THING HAPPENS.

84
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,200
BUT THINGS ARE GOING WELL AND

85
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,067
PEOPLE SEEM REALLY ANGRY ALL THE

86
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:43,336
TIME AND IT KIND OF DOESN'T

87
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,237
COMPUTE AT SOME POINT.

88
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:47,040
>> THE ANGER IS MASKING THEIR

89
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,241
INSECURITY, THEY ARE TERRIFIED.

90
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:49,042
THEY WERE NOT PREDICTING THIS

91
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,411
AND THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE

92
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:51,945
WAS ANY CHANCE THAT

93
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:53,647
CONSERVATIVES MIGHT COME AFTER

94
00:02:53,648 --> 00:02:54,447
THE CULTURAL WAR.

95
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:56,249
THEY WON THE CULTURAL WORE A

96
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:56,850
LONG TIME AGO.

97
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,885
SO FOR KANYE WEST TO STAND UP

98
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:00,954
AND SAY I SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP,

99
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:02,055
THAT TERRIFIES THEM.

100
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,256
SO THEY WILL SAY WHATEVER THEY

101
00:03:03,257 --> 00:03:04,491
CAN TO SMEAR HIM TO MAKE SURE

102
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:05,859
THAT NO OTHER BLACK PEOPLE WAKE

103
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,661
UP AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT HAS

104
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:09,663
BEEN THE LEFT THAT HAS HARMED

105
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:10,297
OUR COMMUNITY.

106
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:12,399
IT HAS BEEN DEMOCRAT POLICIES

107
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,333
THAT HAVE RENDERED OUR

108
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:14,267
COMMUNITIES INITIATE THAT THEY

109
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:19,205
ARE IN TODAY, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

110
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:19,906
CHICAGO, PHILADELPHIA, AND ALL

111
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:20,807
THE THINGS THAT HAVE RUN DOWN.

112
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:22,776
BLACK PEOPLE ARE HAVING A

113
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:25,779
MASSIVE AWAKENING AND KANYE WEST

114
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,413
IS ONE REASON WHY.

115
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,180
>> Laura: YOU'VE MET

116
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:28,615
KANYE WEST AND I GUESS YOU WILL

117
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:29,983
MEET HIM TOMORROW BEFORE HIS

118
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:31,818
LUNCH WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

119
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:32,819
STRIKE UP SOMETHING ABOUT

120
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,219
FRIENDSHIP.

121
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,022
WHAT IS IT WITH HIM AND TRUMP?

122
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:38,491
ARE THEY PALS OR IS THERE A PAST

123
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:39,826
TOWARDS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM

124
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:41,227
OR PRISON REFORM, OTHER WORK

125
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:44,230
THEY MIGHT DO TO GET KIDS OUT OF

126
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,298
GANGS?

127
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,900
WHAT'S A COLLABORATION THERE?

128
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,802
>> I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR

129
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:51,404
HIM, BUT I WILL TELL YOU MY

130
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:52,972
ASSESSMENT AFTER HAVING SEVERAL

131
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:53,973
CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM.

132
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:55,208
FIRST AND FOREMOST, CONNIE IS

133
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,976
EDUCATED ABOUT THE DEMOCRAT

134
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:58,778
PARTY AND THE HISTORY OF THE

135
00:03:58,779 --> 00:03:59,446
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

136
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,014
BEYOND THAT, KANYE WEST BELIEVES

137
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,649
IN UNITED BOTH SIDES AND GOING

138
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,283
FORWARD.

139
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,385
WE KNOW THE LEFT, WE WANT TO

140
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:06,152
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS SEPARATE

141
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:10,490
AND THEY WANT TO KEEP THE FEARS

142
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:12,592
OF RACISM AND FEARMONGERING

143
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:13,159
ALIVE.

144
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,860
KANYE WEST DOESN'T WANT THOSE

145
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:14,194
THINGS.

146
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,695
HE WANTS THE WORLD TO BE BETTER

147
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:17,430
THAN IT WAS YESTERDAY AND HE

148
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,198
SEES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY IN

149
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,999
DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE SEES

150
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,101
THAT OUR PRESIDENT IS COURAGEOUS

151
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:23,803
AND WILLING TO SAY THE THINGS

152
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:25,004
THAT WOULDN'T BE SAID.

153
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:26,172
WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT CERTAINLY

154
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:27,807
THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WHILE

155
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,075
BARACK OBAMA WAS IN OFFICE.

156
00:04:29,076 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Laura: I THINK THEY ARE
