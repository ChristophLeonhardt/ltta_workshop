bra makers makers of lingerie brassieres

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,600
if you will those sorts of products I

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,270
hate nude bras because they aren't nude

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,660
for me and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a good majority</font>

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,340
of the population they aren't nude

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,640
they're beige for a good majority you

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,640
know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to reiterate that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

from this nude bra it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> beige for</font>

18
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,220
lack of a better word or like peach feel

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,720

Crayola has a color for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,460
called peach I don't know anyway my

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,820
point being I wish that some type of bra

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,939

00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:58,979
Styles you know little push-up you want

31
00:01:58,979 --> 00:01:59,490

do you want to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to</font>

33
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,420
do and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start looking at all the</font>

34
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,610
different colors and it's fun what if

35
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,098
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> came up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bra line that was</font>

36
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,940
just called the nude bra and it had

37
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,150
maybe like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know not too many</font>

38
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,620
shades because you don't want to get to

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,260
pc like don't get too crazy pc but maybe

40
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,000
like five to ten shades of different

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,250
color skin tones to cater to a much more

42
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,590
diverse market on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the subject because</font>

43
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,510
don't we know as we all know the whole

44
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,100
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a nude bra is that it would</font>

45
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,720
blend in with your skin tone and

46
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,709
therefore will more or less be less

47
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,450
noticeable depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what you're</font>

48
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,840
wearing so the whole idea of a nude bras

49
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,430
for me to be able to put this on and

50
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,239
then maybe we're like a thinly knit

51
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,120
white shirt and it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because you</font>

52
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't see you know the outlines in my</font>

53
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,950
bra if that's not what I want to go for

54
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,739
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put this on with a white shirt</font>

55
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:07,380
you will see this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> my skin is so</font>

56
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">much darker than this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that bothers</font>

57
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I think of wanting to wear</font>

58
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,720
something where my bra isn't seen I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

59
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,030
to go with black which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually so</font>

60
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,950
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually have nude black and white</font>

61
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,840
those are like always the three they're

62
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">at their definition their definition of</font>

63
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,480
nude black and white that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually what</font>

64
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,989
they do I feel like it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very limiting</font>

65
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:32,870
and thinking from a business perspective

66
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,250
