okay so here we are on our Facebook live and I because I run the show I get to do it I won so I'm having on one of my best friend's Derek gray derek has been my personal trainer since 2013 he's also one of my best friends we've been working out several times a week so that's why beneath this insignificant-looking exterior lies the the body of a Greek god that's only because of Derek gray Derek can brag to you I'm sure endlessly about how buff I am and how I'm chiseled but I want to talk to Derek not about how wonderful I am but how good is a new book is he has a new book called how to stop being lazy and start living healthy Derek's a really interesting fellow because the way he got into personal training is kind of unique Derek welcome to the show and let's just start with this where did you what what got you in a personal training I know the story but no one else does so how did you get into personal training in the beginning pretty amazing story first of all thanks for having me Ben yeah it is a pretty amazing story you see I was kind of scared straight going I was a financial consultant before this but I knew I wouldn't last long in that profession my grandfather my father and my brother all died of heart attacks before the age of 50 I am now 54 and just recently became the first person in my mail the first mail in three generations to hit 50 I had to be different than those before me and the only way I knew how to do that was live a healthy life and personal training was the answer for me and one more the things that I love about working with Derek is that one night when we actually work out there changes up to workout a lot but he's really creative and how he approaches fitness the book again is how to stop being lazy and start living healthy I have a particularly appreciation for it because I wrote the foreword so it's magnificent but Derek is but Derek Kenny can you give it people you know some hints it's to where you start because you talk a lot about working up but you also talk about nutrition what would you say may be your top three lessons on on how to get off your butt and actually start working Ben this book is really an extension of my first book my memoir as I prefaced earlier about being the first male in my family to reach 50 and this is kind of a formula for success on how to maintain your relationship and what I try to do in the book is mend people's relationship with fitness because we all deal with Fitness differently similarly to dealing with death we all deal with death differently but if I can answer that question you have to really want it the power is in our hands as you know unfortunately people grab time as the number one reason why they can't do it I know your schedule and I know you show up three four times a week look there's 86,400 seconds in a day how you spend it is up to you these people need to focus on grabbing that power that they can do it short term goals is a big way don't look at the big thing at the big rainbow at the end with the pot of gold find whatever motivation you have for me it was my family history of heart disease and wanting to live for others some women it may be as simple as wanting to fit into their skinny jeans whatever it is we all have a motivation but the common denominator Bend is fear because we all need to live and live a healthy life and so one of the things that's been fun about working out with Derek for so long is not only getting know him as a person but as I say that the creativity that Derek brings to the nutrition game into the into the fitness game is is really astounding we changed up the workout pretty much every day and I think that's a big one that the Derek talks about in the book is this idea that when you go and workout it's easy to become very bored with what you're doing if you go ahead on the treadmill every single day within a month you're gonna be bored beyond imagination but if you're mixing it up a lot then I know for me that's been a big thing that gets me out working with Derek every day if I hadn't actually set an appointment time or actually have to show up at a certain time and we can change it up every time we work out I'd get very bored very easily I think Derek is really creative about that so talk about a little bit your nutritional strategy because Derek you you've basically been eating clean for years because of fear of heart disease what's the kind of stuff that you eat because I was a year 54 yeah but you look like you're in there 35 thank you you know you I you watch shows all the time they own they talk about different diets and and and diets come and they go and it's it's what I try to propose in the book is a way of life getting foods that you find healthy something that you can pick out of the ground pick out of the ground or pull off of a tree eat as clean as you can what I propose is a way of life not a diet a diet is only temporary and people need to learn a way to eat to be able to sustain it and that's what I try to talk about in the book so you go and every should go and check out the book it's it's a great way of getting started and fitness derrick also does do personal training sessions in LA so if you're in LA no one workout there it's a great person to talk to but his book is called how to stop being lazy and start living healthy that's the second book his first one was his memoir when we were five the diary of an American family that they're both really worth reading and and congratulations to you Derek because the Yankees just got better they
