DANA PERINO AND GREG GUTFELD. IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY AND THIS IS "THE FIVE" ." YET ANOTHER STORM IN WASHINGTON OVER ONE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINEES. THIS TIME, GINA HASPEL UNDER THE MICROSCOPE AT HER CONFIRMATION HEARING WEDNESDAY. THE CIA DIRECTOR NOMINEE APPEARED ON THE HILL TODAY TO MEET WITH SENATORS IN ADVANCE OF THE HEARING. ADMINISTRATION SOURCES CONFIRM GINA HASPEL IS WILLING TO WITHDRAW ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY OF HER ROLE IN THE CIA'S CONTROVERSIAL INTERROGATION PROGRAM. THE WHITE HOUSE IS FIRMLY STANDING BEHIND HER. SHE DESERVES QUICK CONFIRMATION WITHOUT PARTISAN THEATRICS. THE BOTTOM LINE, ACTING DIRECTOR HASPEL HAS AN UNPARALLELED UNDERSTANDING OF THE CIA AND IS THE RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD THEM DURING THESE DANGEROUS TIMES. SHE WANTS TO DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO MAKE SURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE CIA REMAINS INTACT, ISN'T UNNECESSARILY ATTACKED, AND IF SHE FELT THAT HER NOMINATION WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM FOR THEM FOR THE AGENCY, THEN SHE WANTED TO DO EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO PROTECT THE AGENCY. AT THE SAME TIME, SHE WANTS TO DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO PROTECT THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF AMERICANS, WHICH IS WHY SHE IS 100% COMMITTED TO GOING THROUGH THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS. Kimberly: THE PRESIDENT TWEETED HIS SUPPORT EARLIER. "MY HIGHLY RESPECTED NOMINEE FOR CIA DIRECTOR, GINA HASPEL, HAS COME UNDER FIRE BECAUSE SHE WAS TOO TOUGH ON TERRORISTS. THINK OF THAT, IN THESE VERY DANGEROUS TIMES, WE HAVE THE MOST QUALIFIED PERSON, A WOMAN, WHO DEMOCRATS WANT OUT BECAUSE SHE IS TOO TOUGH ON TERROR. WIN GINA!" EVEN PEOPLE WHO USED TOLD US ROLE THINK SHE'S THE RIGHT FIT FOR THE JOB. WITH A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T ALWAYS ATTACH HIS DECISIONS TO THE REAL WORLD, TO DATA, EVIDENCE, GINA HASPEL IS THE ONE WOMAN I WANT IN THAT ROOM WHEN EVERYONE ELSE WILL BE GOING INTO SAYING YOU ARE RIGHT, BOSS. GINA HASPEL WON'T. Kimberly: COMING OUT IN STRONG SUPPORT OF GINA HASPEL SAYING THIS IS THE EXACT PERSON YOU WANT IN THE ROOM AND MAKING THE DECISIONS IN THESE TOUGH TIMES, DEALING WITH TERROR. Greg: I WOULD CALL THAT A BACKHANDED COMPLIMENT. WE NEED TO HAVE HER BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS CRAZY IS BASICALLY WHAT HE SAID. I WONDER, WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS WANT? THEY NEVER WANT AN ADULT. WHO DO THEY WANT? DR. PHIL. APPARENTLY THEY DON'T THINK A WOMAN WHO CAN DO THE JOB. IF THEY CAN DO THAT TO REPUBLICANS, REPUBLICANS CAN DO THAT BACK. THIS IS A BYPRODUCT OF TEAM SPORT POLITICS. THE OTHER TEAM CANNOT MAKE IT EASY FOR YOUR NOMINATIONS TO GET THROUGH. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERTISE OR TALENT. THEY HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT ON THE SAME TEAM. THE OTHER THING, THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF STUFF LIKE THIS, YOU WILL BE PUNISHED IN THE FUTURE FOR THE BRAVE CHOICES YOU MAKE IN THE PAST. HOW WILL IT INFLUENCE PRESENT-DAY PATRIOTS WHEN THEY HAVE TO DO WITH REALLY, REALLY TOUGH CHOICES IN TERMS OF PEOPLE BEING THREATENED OR IT COULD BE AN IMPENDING ATTACK AND YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WELL, AM I GOING TO SACRIFICE MY FUTURE AND MAKE A DECISION THAT COULD BE LOOKED UPON LATER AS ILLEGAL? OR DO I JUST NOT DO THAT AND JUST MAKE THE WORLD LESS SAFE NOW? THAT'S THE THING THAT SCARES NAME. Kimberly: SO TRUE. WHAT ARE THEY EXPECTING, THE DEMOCRATS. GOING TO MAKE A CHOICE THAT PERHAPS THEY THINK IS OKAY BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO IS PUT IN CHARGE OF TERRORISM AND MAKING SURE WE KEEP AMERICA SAFE SEEMS TOO TOUGH ON TERRORISTS? Dana: I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE OF WERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ON THIS. WE HAVE PROVEN THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN, BEING TOUGH ON TERROR. JOHN BRENNAN, WHO WAS A SUPERIOR TO GINA HASPEL, WAS CONFIRMED TO BE CIA DIRECTOR, AND HE DID NOT GO THROUGH THIS KIND OF SCRUTINY. ON SO THE FACT THAT SHE HAS COME UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES LEAVE A LOT OF ROOM FOR QUESTIONS AND HOMES OF THE STRATEGY POLITICALLY. JUST A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT HER. AFTER 9/11, SHE WAS ONE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT WERE ASKED TO DO REALLY TOUGH THINGS. SHE WASN'T THE LAWYER. SHE WAS THE INTELLIGENCE OPERATOR. THE LAWYERS AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DELIBERATE OVER ALL OF THIS, AND THEY SAY HERE'S WHERE THE LAW IS. I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO EMPOWER TERRORISTS THAN TO TAKE OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN INTELLIGENCE, WHAT GREG WAS SAYING, BASICALLY MAKE THEM SECOND-GUESS THEMSELVES. SHOULD I, CAN I, WHAT I? THEY HAD THE LEGAL CLEARANCE. THEY DID REALLY TOUGH THINGS. THEY CAUGHT PEOPLE, I DON'T WANT TO CALL THEM TERRORISTS, LIKE COLLEGIATE MOHAMMED. THERE WERE THREE TERRORISTS WHO WENT THROUGH THE WATERBOARDING. IT'S NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO BE USED UNLESS THIS PRESIDENT OR THIS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR CONGRESS DECIDES TO CHANGE IT. THE SENATOR FROM OREGON SAID WHY HER? SO MANY WOMEN WHO COULD DO THIS JOB. ACTUALLY, EXACTLY HER. 33 YEARS DEDICATED TO PUBLIC SERVICE. SHE ASKED TO BE TRANSFERRED TO COUNTERINTELLIGENCE. SHE WAS TRANSFERRED ON SEPTEMBER SHE WAS TRANSFERRED ON SEPTEMBE1 SHE WAS TRANSFERRED ON SEPTEMBE, SHE WAS TRANSFERRED ON SEPTEMBE2 SHE WAS TRANSFERRED ON SEPTEMBE0 SHE WAS TRANSFERRED ON SEPTEMBE. DOUBTS HER FIRST DAY ON THE JOB. I THINK THEY DESERVE A LOT MORE OF OUR SUPPORT THAN THIS CONDEMNATION DECADES LATER. I DO THINK SHE WILL BE CONFIRMED. THE DEMOCRATS ARE CHOOSING A REALLY UNFORTUNATE REASON TO TRY TO PUT HER THROUGH THE RINGER. LET HER GET THROUGH. SHE IS GOING TO BE CONFIRMED. STEVE THAT IT'S A GOOD POINT YOU MAKE. SHE SHOULD BE RESPECTED, CHOSEN, BASED ON THE MAJORITY OF HER BODY MORE, PROTECTING THE COUNTRY, WORKING AT AND UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS. Dana: I HOPE I CAN ADD ONE MORE THING. I DON'T USUALLY LIKE TO SAY THIS BUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR WOMEN WORKING IN GOVERNMENT FOR HER TO STICK TO IT, TAKE THE SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT, GO FORWARD AND BE CONFIRMED IS SO IMPORTANT. SHE SPENT 33 YEARS THERE. IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR WOMEN IN GOVERNMENT TO GET TO THESE POSITIONS BUT GOVERNMENT IS WHERE WOMEN CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN LEADERSHIP. HER GOING FORWARD, STANDING TALL. SHE HAS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF. SHE HAS EVERYTHING TO BE PROUD OF. IT MEANS A LOT FOR WOMEN BEHIND YOU COMING UP THROUGH THE RANKS IF YOU GO THROUGH THIS CONFIRMATION. Kimberly: I DEDICATED I DEDICATED CAREER. THEY DON'T GET PAID MUCH. THEY WORK VERY HARD, MAKE SACRIFICES. SHE SHOULD BE CHOSEN NOT BECAUSE SHE IS A WOMAN BUT BECAUSE SHE IS THE BEST CHOICE IN CANDIDATE. Brian: PRESIDENT OBAMA COMES IN. ERIC HOLDER SAYS WE'RE GOING TO GO AFTER THE ENHANCED INTERROGATION. LEON PANETTA SAYS BACK OFF. THEN PEOPLE SAY WAIT A SECOND. DOING SOMETHING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ALLOWED ME TO DO TO STOP THE NEXT ATTACK. IF YOU READ JOSE RODRIGUEZ'S BOOK, YOU READ WHAT THE CIA MEN AND WOMEN DID. NO DOUBT THEY STOPPED THE NEXT ATTACK. NOT ONLY DO I HOPE SHE EMBRACES HER ROLE IN THE BLACK SITES AND ENHANCED INTERROGATION. I THINK SHE SHOULD DO IT WITH PRIDE. I THINK SHE SHOULD INVITE PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS DIALOGUE. I DID WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. I AM PROUD OF WHAT I DID AS AN AMERICAN. I FOLLOW THE LAW. I AM VERY PROUD OF IT. FOR 32 YEARS, TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE I AM DEPUTY, NOW ACTING. IF YOU WANT TO GIVE ME THE JOB, DO IT. IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT I DID, HE SHOULD'VE STOPPED, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ALLOWED US TO DO THE PROGRAM BECAUSE IT WAS SIGNED OFF BY EVERYONE. IT COMES DOWN TO VOTES. RAND PAUL, HE WAS AN EYE DOCTOR AT THE TIME. PERFECTLY QUALIFIED TO COMMENT ON THIS. HE DOESN'T WANT TO VOTE FOR HER. IF THE OTHERS HAVE ANY HOPE OF HOLDING ONTO THEIR SEATS IN RED STATES, THEY BETTER VOTE FOR HER. FOR HER TO SAY I DON'T WANT TO BE RONNY JACKSON ON WEDNESDAY AND THEN HAVE TO RUN TO THE CIA TO SAY COME ON BACK, WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR YOU. IT SHOWS ME THE WHITE HOUSE WAS SLOW TO BACK HER. THEY DID NOT GET THE CAMPAIGN GOING. IF POMPEO COULDN'T GET 60 VOTES, SHE IS SAYING WHY DO I WANT TO NOT ONLY NOT GET THE JOB AT ROOM AND MY REPUTATION AT THE SAME TIME. I AM HORRIFIED AND EMBARRASSED FOR LAWMAKERS WHO WILL NOT RUN TO HER DEFENSE RIGHT NOW. Kimberly: YOU ARE RIGHT. SHE SHOULD BE CELEBRATED, SAY WHAT A STRONG, OUTSTANDING CHOICE THE PRESIDENT MADE, AND SHE IS WILLING TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THE COUNTRY FAITHFULLY DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF THOSE TRYING TO BESMIRCH HER REPUTATION. Brian: SHE STOPPED THE NEXT ATTACK. SHE WAS PART OF BLACK SITES. Kimberly: WOMEN AND YOUNG GIRLS GROWING UP SHOULD LOOK UP TO SOMEONE LIKE THIS TO SAY I CAN BE ANYTHING I WANT IN LIFE. LOOK AT THE STRENGTH WHO HAVE COME BEFORE ME. Brian: IF I COULD ADD ONE MORE THING, OF ALL THE ACTING DIRECTOR'S BACTERIA. BRENNAN, CLAPPER. LEON PANETTA, HAYDEN, McGLOCKLIN. Kimberly: LET'S SEE IF SENATOR RAND PAUL AND McCASKILL WILL COME FORWARD. Juan: I THINK YOU SHOULD GET POM-POM'S. YOU COULD BE THE CHEERING SQUAD. LACKS COHERENCE BECAUSE YOU HAVE MILITARY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID WE OPPOSE GINA HASPEL. WHY WOULD 100 OF OUR AMERICAN MILITARY PERSONNEL OPPOSE GINA HASPEL WHEN ALL THE INSIDERS, PEOPLE I KNOW IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMONIZED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, NOW EVERYBODY IS PRO-CIA. THE INSIDERS LOVE GINA HASPEL, TRUST OR COME THINK SHE'S COMPETENT, DENSER DRYWALL. BUT WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO THIS ISSUE, IT'S NOT ABOUT HAVING EVERYBODY ON THE INSIDE SAY YEAH, WE LIKE OUR FELLOW INSIDER. IT'S ABOUT AMERICAN VALUES. IN TERMS OF AMERICAN VALUES, SOMEONE LIKE JOHN McCAIN, WHO WAS TORTURED, SAYS I CAN'T DO THAT. DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO IS DEFINITELY A WOMAN INDEFINITELY OPEN TO HAVING A WOMAN, FIRST WOMAN RUN CIA SAYS THE MORE I READ, THE MORE DISTURBED I AM. Brian: WHERE WAS SHE WHEN THIS WAS HAPPENING? Juan: LET ME JUST FINISH UP. WHAT YOU HAVE IS A SITUATION WHERE MARC SHORT AND SARAH
