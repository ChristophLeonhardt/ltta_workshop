♪ ♪ Tucker: THE FAA HAS FOR DECADES BEEN ONE OF THE MOST TRUSTED INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT AND FOR GOOD REASON. COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL HAS BEEN THE SAFEST IN THE WORLD IN PART BECAUSE OF THE FAA'S HIGH STANDARDS. BUT UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT BEGAN TO CHANGE RADICALLY WITHOUT ANYBODY PAYING ATTENTION. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PRESSURED THE FAA TO MEET ABSTRACT DIVERSITY GOALS. NOBODY BOTHERED TO EXPLAIN WHY DIVERSITY IS A RELEVANT CRITERION FOR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS. NO ONE WILL EXPLAIN IT NOW. WE CALLED THE FAA TODAY AND WE GOT SILENCE WHEN WE ASK THAT QUESTION, WHICH IS THE MOST BASIC QUESTION. BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER. STARTING IN 2014 THEY ADDED A BIOGRAPHICAL QUESTIONNAIRE TO THE APPLICATION PROCESS. APPLICANTS WITH A LOWER APTITUDE IN SCIENCE GOT PREFERENCE OVER APPLICANTS WHO HAD SCORED EXCELLENT IN SCIENCE. APPLICANTS WHO HAD BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR THE PREVIOUS THREE YEARS GOT MORE POINTS AND LICENSED PILOT SCOTT. IN OTHER WORDS, THE FAA ACTIVELY SEARCHED FOR UNQUALIFIED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS. THAT IS INSANE AND THEY KNEW IT WAS INSANE WHEN THEY DID IT BUT THEY DID IT ANYWAY. TODAY WE OBTAINED NEW INFORMATION, AND INTERNAL EMAIL WRITTEN BY AN EXECUTIVE AT THE FIRM THAT DEVISED THE QUESTIONNAIRE. IN THAT EMAIL THE EXECUTIVE ADMITS THAT THE TEST HE DEVISED HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FINDING THE BEST AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS. IF YOU WANT GOOD AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS, FIND PEOPLE WITH EXPERIENCE, THAT WAS HIS ADVICE. THE FAA IGNORED THIS AND USED THE BIOGRAPHICAL SCREEN ANYWAY. THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT FINDING THE BEST AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS THE BEST AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER CONTROLLERS. COMPARED TO DIVERSITY, YOUR SAFETY MEANT NOTHING TO THEM. WE REACHED OUT TO GREG MARTIN, THE FAA'S TOP SPOKESMAN. WE WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE FAA WOULD EVER USE TOTALLY IRRELEVANT CRITERIA SUCH AS WHAT PEOPLE LOOK LIKE IN ORDER TO HIRE FOR A JOB AS VITAL AS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL. WE COULDN'T GET AN ANSWER. WE ALSO ASKED THE ACTING FAA ADMINISTRATOR DANIEL EWELL TO COME ON THIS SHOW AND EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WHY HE WAS TOO COWARDLY TO APPEAR. THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION MICHAEL WHERE TO, THE ONE WHO ORIGINALLY SIGNED OFF ON THE POLICY. HE'S ALSO A COWARD. BUT WE ARE GOING TO KEEP PUSHING UNTIL WE GET AN ANSWER. IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE JOINED BY FORMER AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER MICHAEL PEARSON, WHO IS ALSO A LAWYER AND IS SUING THE FAA OVER ALL OF THIS. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON. Tucker: I WANT TO BE CERTAIN I DIDN'T MISSTATE THAT. THE BIOGRAPHICAL SCREEN, DEVISED UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FOR THE REASONS I EXPLAINED WAS CREATED BY A COMPANY THAT ADMITTED THAT IT WAS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO FIND THE MOST TALENTED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS BUT THE FAA KEPT IT IN ANY WAY, IS THAT CORRECT? THAT'S CORRECT. YOU DIDN'T MISSTATE IT. YOU UNDERSTATED WHAT OCCURRED. TO PUT THIS STORY IN A NUTSHELL, IN LATE 2011, EARLY 2012, MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL BLACK CONTROLLERS ASSOCIATION HAD A MEETING WITH THE RAINBOW PUSH COALITION, JESSE JACKSON AND SOME HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS, PART OF THOSE MEETINGS BY THE WAY. RIGHT AFTER THAT MEETING THEY PUT AN IMMEDIATE HOLD ON HIRING. THEY STOPPED HIRING. THEY HAVE USED IT EXCUSES LIKE SEQUESTERING, BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT HAPPENED. BASICALLY THEY SHUT DOWN THE PROCESS EVEN THOUGH THE NATION NEEDED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS. LOTS WERE RETIRING. THE SYSTEM WAS NEEDING NEW TRAINEES TO GO THROUGH THE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME TO GET THROUGH, BUT THEY DID THAT CONSCIOUSLY. THEN, THE PURGE OF THE 2600 OR MORE QUALIFIED CTI STUDENTS IN GRADUATE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING A TRADITIONALLY BLACK AND DISADVANTAGED COLLEGES WERE WIPED OFF A LIST AND BY THE WAY, THAT LIST, THE 2600 FOLKS INCLUDED A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF FEMALE AND MINORITY APPLICANTS WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS. Tucker: PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO SCHOOL FOR IT BASICALLY GOING TO SCHOOL FOR IT BASICALL BASICALLY. PRIOR MILITARY EXPERIENCE IN THE AREA, PILOTS, SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE MORE QUALIFIED CERTAINLY THAN I WAS WHEN I STARTED. THEN AFTER THAT THEY DESIGNED A TEST TO HER SPEAKING ABOUT, IF BIOGRAPHICAL ASSESSMENT, BIOGRAPHICAL QUESTIONNAIRE. THIS ONE IS CALLED A BIOGRAPHICAL ASSESSMENT THAT WAS MADE FOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE AS YOU STATED. IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE USED THE WAY IT WAS ACTUALLY THE CREATOR ACTUALLY NOTIFIED THEM OF THAT. IN EFFECT THAT TEST PUNISHED PEOPLE WITH AVIATION KNOWLEDGE, ANY AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL EXPERIENCE, ANY AVIATION EXPERIENCE, ANY SCIENCE EXPERIENCE AND THEN THEY CAME OUT AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD ONE INDIVIDUAL, PUBLIC RELATIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST REGION PUBLISH THAT IT WAS FOR DIVERSITY. THAT WAS PULLED BACK IMMEDIATELY AND THEY STATED IT WAS FOR THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST CANDIDATES. Tucker: THIS IS SO ROTTEN AND CORRUPT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE YOU CAN'T TRUST AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL BECAUSE THEY ARE SO DOGMATICALLY IDEOLOGICAL THAT THEY ARE INTENTIONALLY SEEKING THE WORST CANDIDATES. IT'S INSANE. VERY QUICKLY, WHAT ABOUT ALL THE UNIONS AND ALL THE PILOTS GROUPS, PRIVATE COMMERCIAL PILOTS GROUPS. WHAT ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE IN AVIATION WORLD WHO KNEW THIS WAS GOING ON, WHY DID NOBODY SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT? I THINK CERTAIN GROUPS TO TRY TO SAY SOMETHING BUT QUITE FRANKLY THERE WASN'T ENOUGH PRESS COVERAGE ON IT AND BECAUSE OF OTHER POLITICAL REASONS IT DIDN'T COME TO THE FOREFRONT. THE BIGGER QUESTION IS AFTER THE STUDENTS WERE PURGED, THE FAA LITERALLY KNEW THAT THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN CHEATING TO PASS THE NEW BIOGRAPHICAL ASSESSMENT, SO THEY WIPED THE STUDENTS OFF THE LIST, THEY ALLOWED A GROUP TO THEN ENGAGE IN INTENTIONAL TREATING, GAVE BASICALLY THE SUBGROUP, THE BLACK COALITION OF AVIATION EMPLOYEES, THE ANSWERS TO THE TEST. THAT'S AS BIG A STORY AS ANYTHING ELSE. Tucker: UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE OUT OF TIME BUT THIS WILL NOT BE THE LAST TIME WE ADDRESS THIS. THIS IS A THREAT TO THE COUNTRY, IT'S TOTALLY WRONG AND IT CAN ONLY HAPPEN IN SECRECY AND WE
