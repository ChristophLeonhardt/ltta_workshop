LET'S LISTEN IN. 

17
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:19,986
>> WE DO KNOW THAT THEY WERE

00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,021
ACTIVE ON THEIR CELL PHONES 

19
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,557

GIVE US A CALL AT 518-630-1700. 

25
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,637
I WILL OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS 

26
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:38,838
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS 

27
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:39,539
IS AN ONGOING CRIMINAL 

28
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,974
INVESTIGATION AT THIS POINT.  

29
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,408
>> WILL YOU TELL US WHETHER OR 

30
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:43,409
NOT THAT VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE 

31
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:44,344
BEEN ON THE ROAD? 

32
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,478
NOW THAT YOU SAY THE DRIVER 

33
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,147
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A FORMAL 

34
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:51,584
LICENSE TO OPERATE. 

35
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:52,886
>> WELL, THE DRIVER DIDN'T HAVE 

36
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,920
THE FORMAL LICENSE TO OPERATE 

37
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,021
SO NO, IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN 

38
00:00:55,021 --> 00:01:00,693
ON THE ROAD. 

39
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:01,361
THE VEHICLE. 

40
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:01,828
WAS IT OUTDATED? 

41
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:02,629
WAS IT IMPROPERLY FIT? 

42
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,863
>> THE COMPANY AND VEHICLE HAVE 

43
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:04,864
BEEN UNDER SCRUTINY WITH THE 

44
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:05,632
D.O.T. 

45
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,935
IN THE PAST. 

46
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,069
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT 

47
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:10,302
THAT. 

48
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,437
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS 

49
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:12,572
NEGLIGENCE ON SOMEONE TO ALLOW 

50
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,373
THIS ON THE ROAD? 

51
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,307
>> THAT'S PART OF THE 

52
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:14,674
INVESTIGATION. 

53
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,009
>> DO YOU MEAN THE DRIVER IN

DRIVING HISTORY IN TERMS OF 

56
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:18,477
PREVIOUS ACCIDENTS? 

57
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:21,347
>> WE ARE NOT SAYING ANY 

58
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:21,848
INFORMATION. 

59
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,683

60
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:23,950
VEHICLES? 

61
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:35,929
>> YES, WE SEIZE THE VEHICLES 

62
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,963
BASED ON A SEARCH WARRANT 

63
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:37,296
>> HOW MANY? 

64
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:38,698
>> THREE IN ADDITION TO THE ONE 

65
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:39,098
THAT CRASHED. 

66
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,633
>> AND ASK LANE WHAT KIND OF 

67
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,334
VEHICLES THEY WERE? 

68
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:41,968
WERE THEY STRETCH LIMOS? 

69
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,436
>> I BELIEVE TWO WERE TOWN CAR 

70
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,037
STRETCH LIMOS. 

71
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,071
I'M NOT SURE OF THE THIRD. 

72
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,172
>> WHAT SEEMS REMARKABLE IS IN 

73
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,607
THIS CASE, YOU HAVE ALL OF THE 

74
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,875
PEOPLE IN THE LIMO AND TWO 

75
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,642
BYSTANDERS WHO ARE NOW 

76
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,944
DECEASED, WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN I 

77
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,677
IMAGINE PRETTY GOOD WITNESSES 

78
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:53,113
TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING PRIOR TO 

79
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:53,513
THE CRASH. 

80
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,447
YOU TALK ABOUT TEXT MESSAGES. 

81
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,482
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN REPORTS THAT 

82
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,583
PEOPLE ON THE LIMO WERE SENDING 

83
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,383
OUT TEXT MESSAGES, POTENTIALLY 

84
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,818
TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT 

85
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,319
WAS VERY LOUD, IT SEEMED 

86
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,489
UNKEMPT. 

87
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:04,891
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE 

88
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:05,925
LEARNING FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE 

89
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,327
STEPPING FORWARD OFFERING YOU 

90
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:07,727
THAT INFORMATION? 

91
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,761
AND, HOW CRITICAL IS THAT TO 

92
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,330
PUTTING THE PIECES OF THIS 

93
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,032
TOGETHER WITHOUT REVEALING 

94
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:13,332
WITNESSES? 

95
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:15,101
>> ALL OF THAT IS CRITICAL. 

96
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:23,042
THE BLACK BOX INFORMATION, THE 

97
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:23,609

INTERVIEWS, TEXT MESSAGES,

PHOTOS. 

100
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,611
ANYTHING WE CAN FIND WILL PUT 

101
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:26,646
TOGETHER THE FULL PICTURE TO 

102
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,947
FIND OUT IF THERE IS ANY 

103
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:28,414
CRIMINAL CULPABILITY. 

104
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,282
>> WERE PEOPLE COMPLAINING THE 

105
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,583
OF THESE TEXTS THAT YOU HAVE 

106
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,618
SEEN THAT SOMETHING WAS NOT 

107
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,218
RIGHT ABOUT THIS? 

108
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,187
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO 

109
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,688
THIS. 

110
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:36,789
>> HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS TOLD YOU 

111
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,091
AT THIS POINT THAT THE VICTIMS 

112
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,792
HAD SOUGHT A BUS RATHER THAN A 

113
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:40,460
LIMO? 

114
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,195
>> I BELIEVE THEY TRIED TO HIRE 

115
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:42,895
A DIFFERENT VEHICLE BUT IT 

116
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:46,132
CANCELED FOR SOME REASON. 

117
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,467
SO, THE SUBJECT IN CHARGE OF 

118
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,368
THIS EXCURSION SCRAMBLED AND 

119
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,003
FOUND THIS COMPANY TO SATISFY 

120
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:55,241
THEIR NEEDS. 

121
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,676
>> DID YOU SEE THE BUS OR 

122
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,076
SOMETHING LARGER? 

123
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:57,977
>> I DON'T KNOW. 

124
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,145
>> WAS IT THE SAME COMPANY? 

125
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,346
>> NO, IT WAS NOT. 

126
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:01,581
HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH THE OWNER 

127
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,181
OF THE COMPANY? 

128
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:02,782
>> EXCUSE ME? 

129
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:07,253
>> HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH OLD -- 

130
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,087
OWNER OF THE COMPANY? 

131
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,688
>> WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE 

132
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:10,290
OWNER. 

133
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,324
CAN YOU CONFIRM THE NAME? 

134
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:11,824
>> YES. 

135
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:15,595
>> ONE AT A TIME, GUYS. 

136
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,397
>> IS THIS THE SAME MAN WHO WAS 

137
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:21,100
INVOLVED IN THE ALBANY CASE IN 

138
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,467
2004? 

139
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,168
>> AXES ME? 

140
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:27,540
>> HIS MR. HUSSEIN THE SAME MAN 

141
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,641
WHO TESTIFIED IN THE CASE 

142
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,676
AGAINST THE ALBANY PIZZA SHOP? 

143
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:34,581
>> I WOULD REFER YOU TO THE FBI.

144
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,915
>> AND YOU TELL ME ANYTHING 

145
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:36,916
ABOUT WHETHER THE DRIVER WAS 

146
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:37,183
TEXTING? 

147
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,451
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT 

148
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:38,651
YET? 

149
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,386
>> THAT WILL BE PART OF THE 

150
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,822
INVESTIGATION. 

151
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,123
>> TO BE CLEAR, GOVERNOR CUOMO 

152
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,358
SAID THAT THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN 

153
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,559
INSPECTED LAST MONTH BY THE 

154
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:46,993
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 

155
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:47,960
TRANSPORTATION, AND FAILED 

156
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,829
INSPECTION. 

157
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,130
SO DO YOU KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE 

158
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,531
OR NOT? 

159
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,565
>> THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN 

160
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,766
INSPECTED IN THE PAST AND HAS 

161
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:54,233
FAILED INSPECTIONS. 

162
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,601
>> CAN YOU SAY WHAT THAT WAS 

163
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:56,402
AND WHY IT FAILED? 

164
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,904
>> YOU WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO 

165
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,204
THE D.O.T. 

166
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:08,214
>> CAN YOU VERIFY THE OWNER IS 

167
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,215
STILL OUT OF THE COUNTRY? 

168
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,016
>> YES HE IS. 

169
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,050
>> DOES HE FACE CRIMINAL 

170
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,350
CHARGES? 

171
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,852
>> THAT WILL BE PART OF THE 

172
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:13,219
INVESTIGATION. 

173
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,220
WE WILL DETERMINE IF THERE IS 

174
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,088
ANY CRIMINAL CULPABILITY ON THE 

175
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,558
PART OF ANYONE. 

176
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,759
IF THERE IS, WE WILL HOLD HIM 

177
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,259
ACCOUNTABLE. 

178
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,094
>> I'M WONERING HOW THE 

179
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,095
AUTOPSIES, THE MEDICAL STAFF IS 

180
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,229
DOING, AS THEY EMBARK ON THIS. 

181
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,630
ARE YOU IN TOUCH WITH THEM? 

182
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,465
AND HOW IS THAT GOING? 

183
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,465
>> IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT 

184
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:27,600
INVESTIGATION FOR US TO DO. 

185
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,301
WE INVESTIGATE FATAL CRASHES 

186
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,134
ALL THE TIME, YEAR-ROUND. 

187
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:35,375
BUT THIS ONE, THE MAGNITUDE OF 

188
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,609
THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT FOR US. 

189
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,610
>> HOW ABOUT THE ROAD? 

190
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,078
IT COMES DOWN A BIG HILL. 

191
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,079
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT THE 

192
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,913
DANGEROUSNESS OF THAT HILL?

00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,150
INVESTIGATION. 

195
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,685
>> HOW DANGEROUS WAS IT TO PUT 

196
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:51,357
A CAR LIKE THIS ON THE ROAD? 

197
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:51,857
KNOWING THE PROBLEMS? 

198
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:53,192
>> WE WILL DETERMINE THAT. 

199
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,894
AND IF IT'S CRIMINAL, WE'LL

00:04:54,894 --> 00:05:02,635
PROSECUTE. 

201
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,970
>> HOW CAN A MODIFIED VEHICLE 

202
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,437
LIKE THIS -- 

203
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,037
>> THE NTSB? 

204
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,472
>> YEAH, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE 

205
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:06,672

206
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:07,974

207
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,675
NEW YORK STATE POLICE GIVING AS

00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:19,485
AN UPDATE ON THE ONGOING 

209
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,286
INVESTIGATION INTO THE DEADLY 

210
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,821
CRASH THAT KILLED 20 PEOPLE ON

00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,455
SATURDAY IN SCHOHARIE, NEW 

212
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:22,655
YORK. 

213
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,856
WE JUST HEARD THE MAJOR SAY 

214
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,991
THAT THE DRIVER OF THE 

215
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,858
LIMOUSINE SHOULD NEVER HAVE 

216
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,327
BEEN ON THE ROAD,  THAT VEHICLE 

217
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,528
SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ON THE 

218
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:28,728
ROAD. 

219
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,662
IT HAD FAILED INSPECTIONS JUST 

220
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:29,929
RECENTLY. 

221
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,564
HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT ALL OF 

222
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,398
THE PASSENGERS INSIDE THE 

223
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,299
LIMOUSINE, THEY WERE ACTIVE ON 

224
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,133
SOCIAL MEDIA JUST MOMENTS 

225
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,935
BEFORE THAT DEADLY CRASH. 

226
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:36,769
THEY ARE USING THAT 

227
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,537
INFORMATION, LOOKING AT THE 

228
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,272
TEXT MESSAGES AND THEIR POSTS 

229
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,075
TO SEE IF THEY CAN PIECE ALL OF 

230
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:47,413
THIS TOGETHER. 

231
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,648
THE MAJOR WAS ALSO ASKED ABOUT 

232
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,949
THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY AND IF 

233
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:50,883
HE WILL FACE CRIMINAL 

234
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:51,884
PROSECUTION IF THEY FIND THAT 

235
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,720
HE IS AT FAULT, THEY WILL 

236
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,287
PROCEED WITH THAT. 

237
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,254
AGAIN, IT'S AN ONGOING CRIMINAL 

238
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,055
INVESTIGATION AT THIS POINT. 

239
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,724
20 PEOPLE WERE KILLED, AMONG 

240
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:01,327
THOSE PASSENGERS, FOUR SISTERS 

241
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:01,960
AND TWO NEWLYWEDS.
