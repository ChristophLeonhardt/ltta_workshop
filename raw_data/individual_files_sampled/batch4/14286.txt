I watched Sacha Baron Cohen's show last night and I thought that maybe in my previous video I was wrong about him that he didn't go after the left enough because this video it started out with him doing an interview with Bernie Sanders as a character named Billy Wayne Ruddock jr. and he was kind of making fun of him about how to redistribute everyone's wealth in America to the 1% though I thought that I was wrong it seems that it was a really weak attempt to sprinkle in a Democrat to appear fair his second skit was naira Kane d-dan I guess sali√≥ a parody of a bleeding-heart liberal who meets with two Trump voters and attempts to heal the divide but mostly he just talked about his wife's ongoing affair with a dolphin again I thought this was going to be exactly what I wanted him to do and I was criticizing him for not doing in my previous video but he took home that character and brought it to Trump supporters instead of showing how the left would actually buy into all this and how far he can push that and honestly the Trump supporters seemed quite tolerant of it his third character Rick Sherman a recently released convict turn artist who mostly talks to a gallery owner about his bodily fluids again I was quite happy to see him really go after the arts community because this is exactly what I also talked about in a previous video about how ridiculous the arts world is and how you can literally put on a canvas and people will think it's art but in the end I think that she was actually in on the whole skit and it was sprinkled in there to fill a void until the last segment with Aaron Marant impersonating an Israeli weapons expert trying to get the NRA Republicans to say absolutely ridiculous things obviously Phillip Van Cleave was absolutely out of line I don't know what he was thinking going along with all that stuff with the teddy bears and the guns oh my god it's just like super cringy and it's exactly what Cohen wanted but Joel Walsh explained on CNN how he was duped the psychological programming involved he was invited to DC for an award because he was a supporter of Israel he presented the award as one of Israel's greatest friends they provided a hotel a limo they did this like whole interview in a studio about Israel then talked about a story involving a terrorist coming into a school where a four year old grabbed the terrorists gun and kept him at bay they explained some innovative products and asked him to read off a teleprompter after all that immersive experience it's like neuro-linguistic programming at that point his whole reality was like shifted and you know you're put into this situation and you kind of can get pushed if anyone knows what neuro-linguistic programming is about NLP you can really get persuaded to do the most ridiculous things and by the time the words came out of his mouth reading the teleprompter it was too late he can't take it back and they already had the footage and there was nothing they could do about it I mean you could tell that they were reading off a teleprompter they were tricked through psychology they felt they owed something to them by being presented with an award being told about some horrific story involving children and Israel and defending themselves and then made to read off this teleprompter I mean that poor old man you can't really blame him for not knowing what cardi B is or Wiz Khalifa vina I barely know what these people are I mean it's like this old man of course he can get mixed up with saying these things wall mixed to get in with psychological programming he gets them to say stupid things by lying to them yes there was one Republican that they showed who did not fall for the trick however he was still a useful tool to Cohen Matt Gaetz a staunch Trump supporter said you want me to say on television that I support three and four year olds with firearms is that what you're asking me typically members of Congress don't just hear story about a program and indicate whether they support it or not this was still useful to Cohen because Gates showed how ridiculous it is that on TV you support three and four-year-olds with firearms and saying that no congressmen would actually support this or say something like that and then they cut two congressmen and politicians endorsing it and saying that so I think it was quite effective for Cohen to actually include that it made the final scene totally perfect and it was a great setup however I am really proud that he didn't fall for it I mean it was incredible props to him however Cohen still found a way to make it extremely effective for himself the Atlantic said this is a problem that Cohen faced in some of his later films particularly Bruno that tricky balance between being provocative and just being mean it's too easy for the audience that cyntha they used to shift towards his targets particularly when Cohen isn't making a bigger point after all there is no grand idea behind Schurman convincing a gallery owner to surrender her pubic hair so that it could be added to his paintbrush it's just an egotistical display of Cohn's ability to talk anyone into anything is who is America really about America's overall gullible Ness or is it about flaunting Cohen's continued skill with candid camera stunts who is America is making America more divided then there is the stolen valor story Sarah Palin and others duped by Sasha expressed disappointment that Sasha dressed up as a disabled War veteran she said mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want if that let's do sleep at night but how dare you mock those who have fought and served in our military Showtime and Cohen are pushing back saying that there has been widespread misinformation over the past week about the character of Billy Wayne Roddick jr. PhD performed by Sacha Baron Cohen on the Showtime comedy series who is America Baron Cohen did not represent himself as a disabled veteran and viewers nationwide who watched the premiere on Sunday can now attest to that well obviously they can a cut that part altogether out of the show and be not even mention it during the interview will imply it just as he tricked NRA Republicans about the Israeli award it seems very much in line with how Cohen dupes people he presents a situation off-camera only to then dupe them on camera and then edit it a certain way to make it look absolutely ridiculous it's not that far-fetched to assume that Cohen could possibly have presented himself as a war veteran to Palin in order to really get her to commit to this interview because she has the utmost respect for veterans and such people like that and then trap her with that commitment and then dupe her and then present it on camera like oh no we never said we were war veteran see a friend of mine street artist named Sabo in LA has been plastering Hollywood with stolen valor billboards as they push back to all this he is known for calling out Hollywood's crap he told me quote with someone please remind Sasha Baron Cohen that his own country of England is falling apart maybe he can carry his back there where he can Lampoon all the craziness that's going on there I still stand by my statement that Cohen could go after the left even harder his mild attempts to seem fair by including Sanders was absolutely weak he used a character that I imagine he can use with the Republican couple and I imagine he can use that on the far left by really showing how they can be endorsing things like let's say bestiality like with that whole dolphin wife thing or maybe even pedophilia rights I mean this is a real thing that he could really go after left-wing politicians what he did with the gun supporters he could easily have done with far-left politicians and congressmen and having them endorse some absolutely vile and crazy things I know that the far-left congressmen or politicians could be tricked just the same way to endorse pedophilia rights if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
