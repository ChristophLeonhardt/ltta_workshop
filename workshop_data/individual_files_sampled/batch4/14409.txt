we have the Comey memos they have been Declassified and released please read them yourselves but what do you need to know right now well as Molly Hemingway has pointed out just today in her excellent new piece it was all a setup James Comey wrote memos about his confidential meetings with the president memos that were secret that were classified which he leaked to the press during his meetings with the president he told the president that he's not a target of the Russia collusion investigation and that the allegations from the so-called steel dossier were salacious and on the very find quote-unquote a statement that he would repeat in front of Congress the fact that they were lies in fact Russian propaganda paid for by Hillary Clinton that didn't stop James Comey committing felonies by releasing the allegations the unfounded unverified allegations to the press so what do we have we have real collusion we have conspiracy but not by the President or his campaign but by former FBI director James Comey by former Director of National Intelligence clapper by the former Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe and others these individuals lied to the American people and lie to the president the president asked James Comey to publicly make a statement that he is not the subject of the rostra investigation Comey did no such thing instead he illegally leaked the salacious unverified propaganda material from the dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton why would you do that if you know that they're lies for one reason and one reason alone as James Comey has made painfully obvious in the series of embarrassing interviews he's given in the last week he did not want to work for President Trump he may be a Republican but he didn't wish to work for a Republican president especially Donald J Trump he thought Hillary was going to win that's why he exonerated her from his prior investigation on to her felonious use of an unclassified unsecured server for her emails this is just the beginning ladies and gentlemen today we have the Inspector General of the Department of Justice recommend the prosecution for felony offenses of Andrew McCabe who is James James commis former deputy this is a cabal this is a conspiracy this is something that is fundamentally unamerican but have patience it's taken 15 months to get to the truth there is no Russia collusion between the president and his team but there is collusion in the DNC and the highest levels of the Obama administration this is just the beginning people will be charged people will be prosecuted and if we have rule of law in America people will go to prison thank you for watching the Gawker briefing if you like this video please check out the rebel media YouTube channel follow me on Twitter at said Gawker that's Seb ji o RK a and share these videos on Facebook and Twitter because with your help we can push back on the fake news industrial complex and finally get the truth out god bless
