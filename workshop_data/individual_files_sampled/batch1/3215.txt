a lot of reasons people can be bumped from flights where's the one we're all hearing about in the news right now is when lights are oversold there's also involuntary bumping or denied boarding for reasons that are not anything to do with overselling the flight and those reasons could be operational sometimes we have a aircraft that has 200 seats last-minute they find out there might be a mechanical issue so they switch out that aircraft for a smaller aircraft name it has 180 seats and unfortunately just to keep the operation going it would take too long to bring in another plane they're going to have to bump 20 people safety reasons security reasons or healthcare comfort reasons as people are boarding we're on the lookout for possible reasons why a passenger should not be on that flight if we do see something that seems like it shouldn't be on the aircraft Reverend safety and security we would call the captain and we would call security personnel airline crews that need to be repositioned we call it deadheading and that often happens very last-minute very rare but unfortunately if that happens the crew members will be I guess allowed priority boarding and once in a while passengers are bumped for that reason so a couple things I always tell people whenever they're afraid they might give bounces and you know I asked them okay well how did you find your ticket search engines like it's Vidya and kayak.com are great for finding good deals but my comes to buying the ticket I really recommend going to the airline's website if you can go to the airline's website and communicate directly with that company to purchase your ticket that's the best best idea some of the general areas that they look for are the lowest fare tickets those who checked in last not a fun double ticket tickets that are bought through a third party website check in 24 hours ahead of time right at 24 hours as soon as you can folks who have not checked in and have no seat assignments maybe some of the first to be bump you're not the gates often within 10 minutes of departure time that's when they start giving away seats to whoever's on the standby list maybe folks who have been bumped from a previous flight and this is general it's not specific to every single airline
