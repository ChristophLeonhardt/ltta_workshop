44
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:02,753
IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY CARE

45
00:01:02,753 --> 00:01:03,688
ABOUT OUR SCHOOLS.

46
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:04,822
IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY CARE

47
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:05,823
ABOUT OUR BUSINESS CLIMATE

48
00:01:05,823 --> 00:01:07,291

CARE ABOUT HOW MUCH TRAFFIC

50
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,194

00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:20,905
IN FLORIDA HAVE ALL BEEN

59
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:21,305
REPUBLICANS.

60
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:22,974
JEB BUSH, CHARLIE CRIST AND

61
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:23,841
RICK SCOTT.

62
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:24,875
THE STATE IS ALSO HOME TO

63
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,612
THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF

64
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:28,579

THEY CAN RETIRE AND HAVE

68
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,984
GOVERNMENT OFF THEIR BACK.

69
00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:36,354
SO A LOT OF THESE VOTERS

71
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,023
TO COME OUT WHEN THEY VOTE

72
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:41,692
IN HIGHER NUMBERS.

73
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:43,461
>> CONGRESSMAN RON DESANTIS

74
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:44,929
HAS NEVER WON A STATEWIDE

75
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:46,297

THE COMEYS ACCOUNTABLE.

84
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,376
>> AND DOING THAT CAUGHT

85
00:01:58,376 --> 00:01:59,210
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTENTION.

86
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,911
HE TWEETED TODAY CONGRESSMAN

OF FLORIDA.

92
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,718
RON IS STRONG ON BORDERS.

LOVES OUR MILITARY AND OUR

96
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:11,922
VETS.

97
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:13,324
HE WILL BE A GREAT GOVERNOR

98
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:15,293
AND HAS MY FULL ENDORSEMENT.

99
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:16,727
>> AS GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA,

100
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:17,662
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

101
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:18,496
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

102
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:18,929
WHITE HOUSE.

103
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:19,997
WE HAVE A HURRICANE

104
00:02:19,997 --> 00:02:21,499
HOPEFULLY NOT, WE NEED AID,

105
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:23,401
I CALL THE PRESIDENT

106
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:23,768
DROCKETLY.

107
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,902
HE IS GOING TO TAKE MY CALL.

108
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:27,071
>> PUTNAM SUPPORTS 2RU6R7,

109
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:28,172
TOO.

110
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:30,107
BUT DOUBTS DESANTIS CAN USE

111
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:31,909
D.C. CONNECTIONS TO WIN.

112
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:33,444
>> THIS IS A FLORIDA BASED

113
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:33,744
RACE.

114
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:34,612
AND WASHINGTON IS NOT GOING

115
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,680
TO GET IT DONE.

116
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,148
AND DIALING IN A

117
00:02:37,148 --> 00:02:38,115
GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN FROM

118
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:39,784
OUT OF STATE LONG DISTANCE

119
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,352
ISN'T GOING TO GET IT DONE.

120
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:43,888
>> ULTIMATELY THIS RACE'S

121
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:46,057
RESULT MAY CAUSE A RIPPLE

122
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:47,658
EFFECT FELT FAR FROM

123
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:48,059
TALLAHASSEE.

124
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:49,960
>> AS FLORIDA GOES SO DOES

125
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,961
THE NATION GOES.

126
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:51,762
WE ARE A SWING STATE AND

127
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:52,663
IMPORTANT STATE.

128
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:53,731
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK WE SET

129
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:55,232
THE POLICY HERE IF FOR THE

130
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:56,767
REST OF THE STATE.

131
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:57,902
>> FLORIDA WINDS UP BEING

132
00:02:57,902 --> 00:02:59,570
THE BACK DROP FOR MAJOR

133
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,671
POLITICAL NEWS THAN ANYWHERE

134
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:02,306
ELSE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

135
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:03,107
THE PRESIDENT'S MAR-A-LAGO

136
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:04,241
ESTATE IS HIS INVOLVEMENT IN

137
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:05,643
THIS RACE COULD MAKE A BIG

138
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,777
DIFFERENCE AS REPUBLICAN

139
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:08,079
PRIMARY VOTERS THERE GIVE

140
00:03:08,079 --> 00:00:00,000
HIM A SKY HIGH 86% APPROVAL
