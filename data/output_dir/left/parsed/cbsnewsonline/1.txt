MARKINGS TO TRY TO TRACK THIS
BACK TO A PARTICULAR FACILITY.
AND THEN THEY'LL BE WORK
BACKWARDS FROM THAT.
I DID TALK TO A FRIEND, YOU
KNOW, TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE
DIAGNOSTICS GOING ON IN QUANTICO
NOW.
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THAT
WILL BE GOING AROUND THE CLOCK
DOWN IN QUANTICO.
THEY WILL BE TRYING TO LOOK AT
THESE TEN DEVICES THAT HAVE BEEN
COLLECTED SO FAR AND THE
PACKAGING THAT WENT WITH THEM IN
GREAT DETAIL.
YOU KNOW, REALLY IN A TEAM
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE DNA
SPECIALIST WILL BE TALKING TO
THE FINGERPRINT FOLKS, WILL BE
TALKING TO THE FIREARMS AND
MARKS FOLKS TO SEE WHO HAS THE
BEST OPPORTUNITY TO RECOVER
SOMETHING VALUABLE THAT MAY LEAD
THEM TO THE PERSON WHO BUILT
THESE DEVICES.
AND TO TAKE THE BEST SHOT WITH
THE PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE
THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO
RECOVER SOMETHING.
AND I THINK THAT WE CAN EXPECT
TO HEAR SOME MEANINGFUL RESULTS
OUT OF THOSE EXAMINATIONS.
PROBABLY WITHIN THE NEXT FEW
DAYS.
>> WELL LET'S HOPE.
>> THAT PROCESS IS NOT GOING TO
STOP.
>> LET'S HOPE.
RON, I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
I JUST WANT TO READ SOME
INFORMATION THAT I'VE JUST
RECEIVED FROM THE NEW YORK
POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS TOLD OUR
AFFILIATE IN NEW YORK WCBS AND
ALSO TO BRING OUR VIEWERS UP TO
SPEED.
THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE
DEPARTMENT SAYS JUST BEFORE
8:00 P.M.
THE NYPD GOT A CALL
ABOUT A SUSPICIOUS ITEM PACKAGE
ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE TIME
WARNER CENTER.
ESU RESPONDED AND EVACUATED THE
THIRD AND SECOND FLOORS.
THE FIRST FLOOR IS CURRENTLY
BEING EVACUATED.
THE ENTIRE BUILDING IS NOT
EVACUATED.
SO THAT TELLS US SOMETHING ABOUT
THEIR LEVEL OF CONCERN.
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT THIS SITUATION, BUT NOT
CONCERNED ENOUGH TO EVACUATE THE
ENTIRE BUILDING AS THEY DID
YESTERDAY.
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S
IMPORTANT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT
HERE LOOKING AT THESE DEVICES IF
ADDITIONAL ONES ARE DISCOVERED
NOT MISCALCULATE AND BY THAT I
MEAN, NOT SAY, LOOK, TEN OF THEM
HAVE BEEN RECOVERED SO FAR, THEY
DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY WERE READY
TO DETONATE.
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE
THE MECHANISM TO BE VICTIM
DETONATED OR VICTIM ACT WAITED.
LET'S LOWER OUR GUARD.
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S GOING
INTO THE CALCULUS THAT IS
ALLOWING THEM TO REMAIN
POPULATED.
THE BUILDING POPULATED.
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'VE DECIDED
NOT TO EVACUATE THE ENTIRE
BUILDING BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING
YOU JUST MENTIONED.
>> I THINK THAT.
AND IF IN A SCENARIO, LET'S SAY
IT'S A WORST CASE SCENARIO, THAT
THAT DEVICE IS PACKED WITH
EXPLOSIVE POWDER, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE HEARING.
IT MAY BE POWDER.
IT MAY BE BLACK POWDER.
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY FOR SURE.
IT MAY BE INERT.
BUT LET'S SAY IT'S PACKED WITH
THAT.
A DEVICE OF THAT SIZE AND
DIMENSION, HOW MUCH DAMAGE COULD
IT POTENTIALLY DO?
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO
WIPE OUT A MAIN COLUMN OR PILLAR
OF A BUILDING.
IT'S NOT GOING TO WIPE OUT AN
ENTIRE FLOOR OF THE BUILDING.
WE HAVE CONCRETE ABOVE AND
CONCRETE BELOW.
WE DON'T NEED TO EVACUATE THE
WHOLE STRUCTURE.
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS CLEAR OUT A
COUPLE FLOORS.
I THINK THOSE JUDGMENTS ARE
BEING MADE BASED ON WHAT THEY
KNOW SO FAR.
>> WE HAVE A TWEET FROM THE NEW
YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT.
AS A PRECAUTION THE NYPD IS
CURRENTLY EVALUATING A PAIR OF
UNATTENDED PACKAGES AT THE TIME
WARNER CENTER MALL.
MORE INFORMATION WILL BE
RELEASED AS SOON AS IT BECOMES
AVAILABLE.
NOW WE'RE HEARING A PAIR OF
UNATTENDED PACKAGES.
WE THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS A
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE ON THE THIRD
FLOOR.
NOW IT APPEARS THERE ARE TWOCHLT
NOW, THE FACT THAT -- TWO.
NOW, THE FACT THAT THESE ARE
UNATTENDED PACKAGES, RON, DOES
THAT TELL YOU THEY'RE DIFFERENT
THAN THE PACKAGES FOUND IN THE
MAIL?
>> WELL, WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY
GOT THERE.
WERE THEY PLACED THERE THROUGH
THE MAIL AND SOMEBODY INTERNALLY
DELIVERED THEM AND WEREN'T
PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING
ON IN THE NEWS AND THEY'RE
RELATED?
OR IS IT COMPLETELY, YOU KNOW,
OUT OF A SENSE OF SOMEBODY SEES
SOMETHING UNATTENDED IN THIS
TIME IN THIS LOCATION IN NEW
YORK CITY AND THEY CALL 911.
IT'S AN UNATTENDED PACKAGE.
SO WE HAVEN'T HEARD IN ANY SORT
OF DETAIL THE DESCRIPTION OF THE
PACKAGE.
THIS MAY BE AN ABUNDANCE OF
CAUTION BY SOMEBODY WHO SEES A
BACKPACK OR SOMETHING SITTING
UNATTENDED AND LIKE WE ARE
EXPECTED TO DO IN AN AIRPORT OR
RAILWAY TRANSIT, HEY, LET
SOMEBODY KNOW ABOUT THAT.
LET THE PROFESSIONALS COME AND
ADDRESS IT.
IF IT'S NOTHING, IT'S NOTHING.
YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD A MINOR
INCONVENIENCE.
IF IT'S SOMETHING, WELL, THAT'S
IMPORTANT TOO.
SO IT COULD BE TOTALLY
UNRELATED.
IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WHEN
IT'S DELIVERED A COUPLE DAYS AGO
AND IT'S BEEN SITTING AND
NOBODY'S NOTICED UNTIL NOW.
>> MY PRODUCERS SAY THE
SUBBASEMENT AND WHOLE FOODS ARE
ALSO FULLY EVACUATED.
PAUL, ARE YOU STILL WITH US?
>> YES, I AM.
>> I'D LOVE TO ASK YOU AS WELL
WHAT YOU THINK IN A CITY LIKE
NEW YORK WHERE, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A DELICATE BALANCE THAT
NEEDS TO BE STRUCK BETWEEN
PROTECTING THE CITIZENS AND THE
TOURIST SXSZ ALL THE PEOPLE ON
THE STREET -- TOURISTS, AND ALL
THE PEOPLE ON THE STREET WHICH
IS, OF COURSE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S
PRIORITY.
BUT IT ALSO HAS TO CONSIDER THIS
IS A CITY THAT NEEDS TO KEEP
MOVING, RIGHT?
I MEAN THE TRAFFIC NEEDS TO KEEP
MOVING.
BUSINESS NEEDS TO COPE
HAPPENING.
YOU KNOW -- TO KEEP HAPPENING.
YOU KNOW, IT CAN'T BE
INDEFINITELY SHUT DOWN.
WHERE DO THEY STRIKE THAT
BALANCE?
>> THAT'S JUST IT.
RON PUT UP THE BEST ANALOGY YOU
COULD HAVE COMPARING IT TO AN
AIRPORT.
TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF ANALOGY,
WHEN WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN
FORT LAUDERDALE, YOU DIDN'T SHUT
DOWN THE AIRPORT, YOU SHUT DOWN
A TERMINAL.
THIS THIS PARTICULAR CASE -- IN
THIS PARTICULAR CASE AND IN THIS
CITY OF NEW YORK, WHAT'S UNIQUE
IS THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS.
AND THEY WORK IN CONJUNCTION
WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
CONSISTENTLY.
SO AS THAT RELATES TO TRAINING
THEY INTEGRATE THEIR TRAINING IN
SCENARIOS SUCH AS THIS IN
EVACUATION SCENARIOS.
THIS IS NOTHING NEW.
THEY REALIZE THAT.
THAT TIME WARNER CENTER NEEDS TO
STAY OPEN EXCEPT FOREVER THE
AREAS THAT -- FOR THE AREAS THAT
NEED TO BE RESTRICTED.
IT CAN BE ANY BUILDING.
SO THERE IS THAT BALANCE.
BALANCE IS BASED ON WHAT THE
PRONLT OF RISK IS -- PROBABILITY
OF RISK IS, WHAT THE IDENTITY OF
RISK IS, AND HOW BOTH GROUPS
HAVE TRAINED IN REGARD TO THE
THREAT AND HOW TO EVACUATE
EXPEDITIONLY.
-- EXPEDITIOUSLY.
A LOT OF TRAINING GOES INTO
THIS.
>> I'M SO GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO
MAKE THAT CALL AND I'M GLAD THE
EXPERTS ARE MAKING IT.
THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON THEIR
KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF
THE SITUATION.
I WILL POINT OUT THAT WE ARE
CONTINUING, THOUGH, TO SEE
GROUPS OF NYPD, YOU KNOW,
POURING INTO THE BUILDING WITH
LOTS AND LOTS OF EQUIPMENT.
>> SURE.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL OF THIS
EQUIPMENT IS.
OF COURSE WE SAW THE BOK SQUAD
EARLIER.
MAYBE YOU -- BOMB SQUAD EARLIER.
MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN THIS TO
US.
>> THE NYPD IS 36,000 STRONG.
THE LARGEST POLICE DEPARTMENT IN
THE UNITED STATES.
AND VERY WELL FUNDED.
THEY DO HAVE EQUIPMENT THAT MOST
DEPARTMENTS CLEARLY DO NOT.
AND THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IS
SUPPRESSION EQUIPMENT.
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
IF THERE'S A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE
AT ANY PARTICULAR BUILDING,
WE'LL USE TIME WARNER, AND IT'S
IDENTIFIED AS A SUSPICIOUS
PACKAGE, THE DEPARTMENT'S
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO CONTAIN
THAT.
WE'RE TALKING EXPLOSIVE DEVICES,
AS RON POINTED OUT BLACK POWDER.
THE DIFFERENCE HERE BEING THAT
IF THAT PACKAGE APPEARED TO HAVE
WHITE POWDER OR POTENTIALLY
ANTHRAX THEY'LL HAVE TO SHUT
DOWN THE HVAC SYSTEM TO THE
WHOLE BUILDING.
SO THE EQUIPMENT THAT'S GOING TO
BE BROUGHT IN IS GOING TO BE
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S BEING
OBSERVED BY FIRST RESPS.
THEY NEED TO VALIDATE THE RISK
BEFORE THEY REMOVE THE ITEM.
ANOTHER GREAT POINT RON POINTED
OUT, THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO REVAC
WAIT WHERE THEY HAVE TO.
-- EVACUATE WHERE THEY HAVE TO.
AND THAT'S THE KEY PART.
SO THAT'S THE WINT YOU'RE GOING
TO SEE BROUGHT -- THE EQUIPMENT
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE BROUGHT IN.
THE OVERALL INVOLVEMENT FOR THE
ENTIRE AREA.
>> TELL US ABOUT THE STRUCTURE
OF A BUILDING LIKE THE TIME
WARNER CENTER.
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS ON ONE
FLOOR, IT WON'T NECESSARILY
AFFECT ANOTHER FLOOR.
IT IS THAT RIGHT?
>> -- IT THAT RIGHT?
>> -- IS THAT RIGHT?
>> THE TIME WARNER BUILDING LIKE
MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN
RETROFITTED IN THE POST-9/11
WORLD.
I CAN TELL YOU THESE BUILDINGS
ARE NOT DESIGNED TO LEAN
FORWARD.
SO GOD FORBID SOMETHING HAPPENS,
THEY'RE DESIGNED TO COME
STRAIGHT DOWN.
>> LIKE THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
BUILDING.
>> THEY WORK WITH ENGINEERS TO
UNDERSTAND WHERE STRESS POINTS
ARE.
THESE ARE THE PARTS THAT NEED TO
BE PROTECTED MORE THAN ANYTHING
ELSE.
>> THAT WOULD FACTOR INTO THE
DECISION RIGHT NOW TO NOT
EVACUATE ALL THE FLOORS OF THE
TIME WARNER TOWER.
>> CORRECT.
AND REMEMBER IT'S WHAT THEY'VE
SEEN, TANYA.
I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH
PACKAGES THAT ARE BEING
IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.
AND THANK GOD NONE HAVE
DETONATED, BUT THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE LOOKING AT.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT
COULD HAVE BEEN A BIOLOGICAL
AGENT.
IF WE SEE THAT I CAN TELL YOU
AND ASSURE YOU THAT HVAC SYSTEM
WILL SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY AND
THEY WILL EVACUATE THE BUILDING.
YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED AT
THE POST OFFICE IN THE D.C.
AREA, ONE SPORE, JUST ONE SPORE
OF ANTHRAX CAN GET THROUGH THAT
BUILDING THIS A MATTER OF
MINUTES WITH REGARDS TO THE HVAC
SYSTEM.
IF THAT HAPPENS YOU'LL SEE AN
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PROTOCOL.
>> THANKFULLY WE HAVEN'T HAD
ANYMORE INCIDENTS WITH ANTHRAX
AFTER THAT.
IS THAT RIGHT?
I MEAN.
>> WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY MAJOR
SINCE THAT PARTICULAR TIMEFRAME.
THANK GOD, WE HAVEN'T.
BUT CREDITS TO JOHNS HOPKINS APL
BECAUSE THEY DID A LOT OF
RESEARCH THAT PROVIDED SOME
GREAT EDUCATION TO IDENTIFY AND
MITIGATE THINGS EARLY.
SO CREDIT TO THEM.
NO, WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING
MAJOR SINCE THAT POINT IN TIME.
>> I WANT TO UPDATE FOR
VIEWERS.
A PAIR OF SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES
WERE DISCOVERED BY THE NYPD ON
THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE TIME
WARNER CENTER.
AND AS IT NOW STANDS THOSE
PACKAGES ARE BEING INVESTIGATED.
WE'VE SEEN THE BOMB SQUAD ENTER.
WE'VE SEEN ALL KINDS OF NEW YORK
POLICE DEPARTMENT TEAMS WITH
VARIOUS VERY SOPHISTICATED
EQUIPMENT ENTERING THE BUILDING.
THE SUBBASEMENT, THE FIRST
FLOOR, THE SECOND FLOOR, THE
THIRD FLOOR HAVE ALL BEEN
EVACUATED.
THE REST OF THE BUILDING HAS NOT
BEEN EVACUATED.
BUT THIS IS CLEARLY AN ONGOING
SITUATION.
RON, ARE YOU STILL WITH US?
>> I AM.
>> SO RON, YOU PROBABLY ARE
SEEING THE SAME IMAGES THAT WE
ARE OF ALL OF THIS EQUIPMENT
ENTERING THE BUILDING.
DOES THIS TELL YOU THEN THAT LAW
ENFORCEMENT HAS A HANDLE ON
THESE PACKAGES?
SORT OF K-9 OF CAN UNDERSTAND --
KIND OF CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY
ARE AND IS GOING TO DETONATE
THEM SAFELY OR SEE IF THEY'RE
GOING TO BE DETONATED?
>> I HAVE TO BELIEVE BY NOW THAT
LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOWS WHAT'S
BEEN PLACED IN THESE PACKAGES
THAT ARE DOWN AT QUANTICO.
THAT THEY HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING
OF THAT AND THAT INTELLIGENCE IS
GOING BACK TO THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT.
AND THE NEW YORK POLICE
DEPARTMENT SHARED WITH THE FBI,
SHARED WITH THE SECRET SERVICE
AND THE OTHER COMPONENTS
INVOLVED IN THE JTTF RESPONSE NO
MATTER WHAT CITY.
BUT EVEN IF THAT WAS TO BE THE
SUSPECTED EXPLOSIVE, TURNED OUT
TO BE INERT.
I I THINK THEY HAVE TO RESPOND
IN A MUSCLED UP WAY PARTICULARLY
IN THE TIME WARNER CENTER.
PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE'S A
SUSPICIOUS DEVICE AROUND ANY
FUTURE LIKELY RECIPIENT.
THEY HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE
WHAT IF THIS PERSON -- LET'S SEE
THESE FIRST TEN DEVICES WERE ALL
INERT.
AND HE DECIDED, HEY, THEY DROP
THEIR GUARD.
THE 11TH ONE IS GOING TO
EXPLODE.
>> RIGHT.
>> SO I THINK UNTIL THEY HAVE
SOMEBODY IN HANDCUFFS, THEY'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO RESPON
AGGRESSIVELY, FULLY, AND
CERTAINFULLY A PLACE WHERE A
DEVICE -- CERTAINLY IN A PLACE
WHERE A DEVICE HAS BEEN SENT IN
THE PAST.
AND THAT WOULD BE THE TIME
WARNER CENTER.
>> WE HEARD THE MAYOR TODAY
SAYING YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY
SOMETHING.
CALL POLICE.
YOU KNOW, SO WE CAN PROBABLY
EXPECT AT LEAST IN THE NEAR
FUTURE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF
PEOPLE REPORTING A LOT OF
THINGS.
SOME OF WHICH WILL PAN OUT TO
NOT BE WORRISOME.
BUT IT'S BETTER TO REPORT THAN
NOT REPORT.
BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
I THINK WE ARE MORE LIKELY IN
THE COMING DAYS TO SEE FALSE
ALARMS MUSCLED UP POLICE
RESPONSES THAT TURN OUT TO BE
NOTHING.
THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S OKAY.
I THINK THE COMMISSIONER WAS
INVITING THEM, NEW YORK CITY,
LET'S GUESS RIGHT.
LET'S NOT GUESS WRONG.
>> HE DID SAY THERE'S NO CURRENT
INTELLIGENCE TO SUGGEST THAT
THERE IS ANY IMMINENT DANGER
FACING THE CITY, BUT THIS JUST
GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT
INTELLIGENCE OR NOT ANYTHING
COULD HAPPEN AT ANY TIME.
>> THAT'S VERY TRUE.
AND WE CANNOT FORECLOSE THE
POSSIBILITY THAT SOME COPYCAT
OUT THERE WANTS TO HAVE A LITTLE
BIT OF FUN WITH US AND SEE WHAT
KIND OF INFLUENCE HE CAN HAVE
BOTH ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
COMPONENTS AND ON THE MEDIA.
BECAUSE AS PAUL MENTIONED
EARLIER, SOME OF THIS IS ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, COMMANDING ATTENTION
AND POWER.
AND THE GRATIFICATION OF
WATCHING THIS RESPONSE.
LOOK WHAT I CAN DO.
LOOK HOW I CAN MANIPULATE.
THAT MAY WELL BE IN THIS
OFFENDER'S HEAD.
YOU KNOW, WE HEAR OF THESE
REPORTS WITH ARSON ITSELVES
SOMETIMES.
THEY LIGHT THE -- ARSONISTS
SOMETIMES.
THEY LIGHT THE FIRE AND THEY SIT
BACK AND WATCH IT.
THEY LIKE THAT.
THEY CONTROL THAT.
IS THAT A FACTOR HERE?
THAT MAY WELL BE.
LOOK AT THE MEDIA COVERAGE THAT
THIS PERSON HAS COMMANDED SO
FAR.
>> IT'S SO UNFORTUNATE THAT THE
PARTICULAR PSYCHOLOGY OF THE
CRIMINAL MIND THAT FEEDS ON THE
ATTENTION AND COVERAGE THAT HIS
OR HER ACTS GET.
I'M WONDERING IF TONY WHO'S
THERE ON THE SCENE IS STILL WITH
US.
OH, WE DO NOT HAVE TONY ANY
LONGER.
PAUL, I WONDER WHAT YOU CAN ADD
TO THE SORT OF -- THE IDEA THAT
THIS COULD BE A COPYCAT OR
SOMEBODY THAT SORT OF IS JUST
PIGGYBACKING ON THE -- ALL THE
EXCITEMENT AND, YOU KNOW, DANGER
THAT WAS IN THE AREA YESTERDAY
AND SAID HEY, WOULDN'T IT BE A
GAS IF I GOT EVERYBODY RILED UP
AGAIN?
>> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK IT'S
HIGHLY PROBABLE.
AND FOR THE SAME THING WE COVER
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, WORKPLACE
SHOOTINGS YOU SEE IN A CERTAIN
PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THAT
ANOTHER INCIDENT BECAUSE THEY
RECOGNIZE THE ATTENTION THE
PREVIOUS PERSON GOT.
I THINK IT'S HIGHLY PROBABLE.
THE OTHER POINT TOO THAT RON
RAISED A GREAT POINT AS FAR AS
THE NOTORIETY HERE.
REMEMBER, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS
CRIME SCENE, AND ONE THING I
THINK OUR VIEWERS WOULD FIND
INTERESTING IS THE FACT THAT
RIGHT NOW YOU CAN EXPECT NYPD
PLAIN CLOTHES DETECTIVES WALKING
THROUGH THE CROWDS BEHIND THE
TAPE TAKING A LOOK AND JUST
OBSERVING AND RECOGNIZING, YOU
KNOW, THE VARIOUS PEOPLE THAT
ARE IN THAT CROWD BECAUSE AS RON
POINTED OUT ABOUT AN ARSONIST,
IT'S HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT PERSON
COULD BE IN THIS CROWD ENJOYING
AND WATCHING THE POLICE
RESPONSE.
>> I WANT TO ADD TO WHAT YOU
SAID ABOUT THIS PERSON POSSIBLY
BEING IN THE CROWD.
I WANT TO POINT OUT THERE ARE
CAMERAS EVERYWHERE PROBABLY IN
THE TIME WARNER CENTER.
>> EXACTLY.
>> IF SOMEONE ASSUMES THAT THEY
PUT TWO SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES ON
THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE TIME
WARNER CENTER WITH NO ONE SEEING
THEM, I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY
MISTAKEN.
>> LOOK AT THE BEHAVIORAL
PROFILE OF A GUY LIKE THIS.
BELIEVES HE CAN HIDE IN PLAIN
SIGHT.
SO BY STANDING IN THE MIDST OF A
LARGE CROWD AND ASSIMILATING
INTO THE AREA, HE'S REAPING
ENJOYMENT.
HE'S WATCHING EVERYONE RUN
AROUND AND SCURRY AROUND BECAUSE
.
YOU KNOW, THE DEVICE HE PUT
SOMEWHERE.
>> IN TERMS OF INTERNAL
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS IN THE TIME
WARNER BUILDING, IS IT SAFE TO
ASSUME THEY ARE PROBABLY
EVERYWHERE?
>> THAT'S A FACT.
IT'S A CERTAINTY.
LET'S LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S OCTOBER 25TH.
SO PEOPLE ARE WALKING AROUND
THIS COATS.
THEY HAVE HATS.
PEOPLE HAVE BACKPACKS.
AND IF YOU'RE NOT LOOKING UP,
THE CAMERA'S GOING TO SEE THE
TOP OF YOUR HEAD.
AND THIS INDIVIDUAL IS SMART
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT.
HE'S SENT 11 DEVICES AND NOTHING
HAS BEEN DETONATED.
HE'S NOT STUPID.
>> IF IT'S THE -- THAT'S A BIG
LEAP, IF IT'S THE SAME
INDIVIDUAL.
>> IF IT'S THE SAME INDIVIDUAL,
RIGHT.
IF IT'S THE SAME INDIVIDUAL.
BUT IF IT'S NOT, IT'S SEVERAL
INDIVIDUALS.
AND YOU KNOW, WE STILL HAVE
NOTHING THAT'S DETONATING.
THIS INDIVIDUAL BY PLACING
SOMETHING IN TIME WARNER TONIGHT
IT'S SUCH A LARGE VENUE.
IT'S SUCH A LARGE VENUE.
THAT TO WALK INSIDE WITH A COAT
AND HAT TO PLACE A BACKPACK DOWN
AND TO WALK AWAY AS CROWDED AS
IT IS ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME,
IT'S ESPECIALLY ON A NIGHT LIKE
TONIGHT IT'S NOT UNLIKELY A
CAMERA WOULDN'T PICK HIM UP ON
THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SIDE.
>> I WANT TO POINT OUT WE CAN'T
CONFIRM THIS PACKAGE WAS HAND
DELIVERED AND LEFT ON THE FLOOR.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOT IN.
IT COULD HAVE VERY WELL BEEN
SOMETHING DELIVERED TO ONE OF
THESE STORES THROUGH THE MAIL AS
WELL.
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHETHER
AN INDIVIDUAL ACTUALLY PLACED
THESE TWO PACKAGES INSIDE THE
TIME WARNER CENTER.
>> AND IF IT CAME THROUGH THE
MAIL IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY
CONSISTENT WITH EVERYTHING ELSE.
>> EXACTLY.
EXACTLY
SO THAT IS A LITTLE MISSING
PIECE OF INFORMATION.
A LOT OF MISSING PIECES OF
INFORMATION RIGHT NOW.
BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY KEEPING ON
THIS STORY THAT IT CONTINUES TO
DEVELOP.
I MEAN, IT IS NOT -- THERE'S NO
INDICATION OR SIGNS YET THAT THE
POLICE ARE WRAPPING UP THEIR
WORK HERE.
>> NO.
AND AGAIN, THE THING THAT PEOPLE
NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND NOT JUST
IN NEW YORK.
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT.
THIS IS NOT A NEW YORK THING.
THIS IS A NATIONAL THING.
SO IT'S TO BE EXPECTED IN THE
DAYS TO COME AND NOT TO PANIC
OVER IT THAT VERY POSSIBLY A
BUILDING MAY REQUIRE AN
EVACUATION BECAUSE OF A
HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF ALERT THAT'S
BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN BUILDING
SECURITY PROTOCOLS BASED ON MAIL
SCREENING.
AND IT'S PROBABLE.
SO FOR PEOPLE NOT TO PANIC AND
CALMLY EVACUATE.
>> THERE COULD BE A LOT OF FALSE
ALARMS IN THE DAYS AHEAD AS RON
SAID.
RON, HOW LONG -- RON OR PAUL,
WHOEVER'S WITH US, HOW LONG
WOULD YOU EXPECT THIS PORTION OF
THE INVESTIGATION OR THE -- IF
THEY HAVE TO DETONATE SOMETHING
OR IF THEY HAVE TO REMOVE IT
FROM THE BUILDING, HOW LONG WILL
THIS PROCESS TAKE?
>> WELL, PART OF THAT'S GOING TO
DEPEND ON HOW CLOSE THE BOMB
SQUAD IS AND THEIR AVAILABILITY.
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY HAVE
CONTAINMENT VESSELS SCATTERED
AROUND THE BOROUGHS OF NEW YORK.
THEY CERTAINLY HAVE BOMB
TECHNICIANS SCATTERED AROUND THE
DIFFERENT BOROUGHS OF NEW YORK
EVEN THOUGH IT'S EVENING IT'S
NYPD, RIGHT?
NOBODY SLEEPS.
SO THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
COVERAGE.
IT'S A MATTER OF GETTING THROUGH
TRAFFIC.
GETTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE THERE.
ASSESSING THE PACKAGE.
THIS IS NOT A BEAT COP WALKING
UP WITH A NIGHT STICK AND POKING
AT IT SAYING LOOKS OKAY TO ME.
YOU REALLY WANT TO GET
PROFESSIONALS IN.
THOSE ARE TRAINED BOMB
TECHNICIANS WITH THE TOOLS, THE
DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, TO GET UP
THERE VERY OFTEN TO PUT AN X-RAY
ON IT, TAKE A LOOK AT THE X-RAY.
THE FIRST ONE DOESN'T WORK, TAKE
ANOTHER X-RAY.
GO BACK TO, YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT
DIAGNOSTICS WITH MULTIPLE
PEOPLE.
THIS COULD TAKE AN HOUR OR TWO
UNTIL SOME SORT OF ALL CLEAR IS
GIVEN OR THEY MAKE A DECISION
LET'S TAKE IT OUT AND RENDER IT
SAFE IF WE HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT
IT'S POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE,
LET'S GET THE CONTAINMENT
VESSEL, WALK IT DOWN, PUT IT ON
THE LOADING DOCK.
IF THEY CAN MOVE IT, THEY MAY
DECIDE WE NEED A ROBOT BECAUSE
THIS THING IS A LITTLE BIT MORE
CURIOUS TO US OR WE'RE MORE
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT
BE.
LET'S GET A ROBOT IN TO DO THAT
RATHER THAN A HUMAN BEING IN A
BOMB SUIT.
SO ALL OF THAT AND JUST REALLY
THE TRANSPORTATION AND GETTING
THROUGH TRAFFIC MAY BE THE
BIGGEST DELAY.
THE DIAGNOSTICS WILL TAKE A
LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND IT COULD
BE THE ALL CLEAR IS GIVEN OR
THEY'RE HAULING IT OUT IN THE
NEXT 40 MINUTES.
>> THE TRAFFIC IN A CITY LIKE
THIS ONE WILL COME INTO PLAY.
WHAT DOES ILL TELL YOU, THOUGH,
ABOUT THE -- IT TELL YOU,
THOUGH, ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY
HAVEN'T SHUT DOWN THE STREETS OR
EVACUATED THE WHOLE BUILDING?
AND POLICE SEEM TO BE SOMEWHAT
LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THE
SITUATION.
DOES THAT -- WHAT DOES THAT TELL
YOU?
>> WELL, THAT'S KIND OF THE VIBE
I'VE BEEN GETTING EVEN WHILE
WE'RE ON THE PHONE.
THE POLICE DON'T SEEM TO BE TOO
AMPED UP ABOUT THIS.
THAT TELLS ME THEY'VE MADE SOME
SORT OF PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT.
THEY'RE TELLING EACH OTHER,
LET'S TAKE A DEEP BREATH, SLOW
IT DOWN, DON'T GET ANYBODY HURT
GETTING HERE.
PRESUMABLY THE INITIAL
ASSESSMENT IS A GOOD ONE AND
THEY CAN LET PEOPLE BACK IN.
>> THAT'S CERTAINLY GOOD NEWS,
RON.
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR.
>> THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AND PAUL, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO ADD TO THAT?
IS THAT THE SENSE YOU'RE GETTING
AS WELL?
THIS IS SOMETHING THEY HAVE A
HANDLE ON AT THIS POINT?
>> I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH RON.
THAT'S THE EXCLAMATION POINT.
WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS
CAPPING THINGS UP.
YOU CAN SEE AS WE'RE WATCHING ON
THE CBSN SCENE, YOU CAN START TO
SEE WHERE NYPD OFFICERS ARE
WALKING OUT WITH DUFFEL BAGS AND
THINGS OF THAT NATURE.
I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH RON.
IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THIS IS
STARTING TO GET WRAPPED UP.
>> ALL RIGHT.
WELL RON HOSKO, PAUL VIOLAS,
THANKS FOR STICKING WITH US AND
GIVING US YOUR INSIGHT.
I WANT TO RECAP FOR OUR VIEWERS,
PART OF THE TIME WARNER CENTER
IN NEW YORK CITY HAS BEEN
EVACUATED.
POLICE SAY TWO SUSPICIOUS
PACKAGES WERE FOUND ON THE THIRD
FLOOR OF THE BUILDING WHICH DOES
HOUSE CNN'S NEW YORK
HEADQUARTERS.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK
BREAK NOW.
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THIS AND
THE REST OF THE DAY'S NEWS IN A
FEW MOMENTS.
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
STAY WITH US.
>>> ACCUSATIONS OF VOTER
SUPPRESSION DOMINATED GEORGIA'S
GOVERNOR DEBATE TUESDAY.
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND
CURRENT GEORGIA SECRETARY OF
STATE BRIAN KEMP IS ACCUSED OF
BLOCKING ABOUT 53,000
VOTER APPLICATIONS, MOST OF
WHICH ARE FROM MINORITIES.
THOSE VOTES COULD BE CRUCIAL
FOR STACEY ABRAMS LOOKING TO BE
THE FIRST FEMALE BLACK GOVERNOR
IN U.S. HISTORY.
THE TWO CANDIDATES ARE NECK AND
NECK IN THE POLLS.
FOR MORE ON THIS THE
ECONOMIST'S WASHINGTON
CORRESPONDENT JOHN BASSMAN
JOINS ME NOW ON SET.
HE'S BEEN FOLLOWING THIS ISSUE
CLOSELY.
JOHN, A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU
WITH US HERE.
SO, YOU KNOW, LET'S BREAK THIS
DOWN EXACTLY.
WHY IS VOTER SUPPRESSION SUCH A
BIG ISSUE IN THIS ELECTION?
>> WELL, THE BET THAT STACEY
ABRAMS HAS MADE T THEORY OF THE
ELECTORATE SHE'S USING IS
SIMILAR TO THE ONE ANDREW GILLUM
IS USING IN FLORIDA.
FOR THE LAST COUPLE CYCLES
GEORGIA DEMOCRATS HAVE NOMINATED
FA
