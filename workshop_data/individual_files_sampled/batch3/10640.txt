to the UK now we're an independent British press watchdog is encouraging 2500 newspapers and websites in the country to display a new logo that it has designed the mark is to show that it deems the outlets reputable and that they're not producing fake or misleading news I strongly believe that IPS owe membership helps our publishers distinguish themselves from the unregulated thereby demonstrating that they choose to hold themselves accountable to higher standards however some of the publications that are affiliated with epsilon which will be eligible to use the seal of approval have pretty dubious reporting records they deal email for instance back in had to publish a retraction after releasing an article suggesting Donald Trump's wife was working for an escort service and the Sun newspaper has also had to admit to publishing factually inaccurate articles in the past one story which it ran which drew controversy came that one in five British Muslims sympathized with Islamic state that was fine to be false by regulators stating that the article was significantly misleading political activist George barter says these examples are just the tip of the iceberg it's very much up for grabs in so many ways what what is the truth these days now what I would say from my point of view is that there is still a role for you know media organizations that have some kind of framework around them some kind of resources behind them that can do it to proper investigations and you know reveal important things Daily Telegraph for instance which is signed up to tip so the self-regulation body is responsible in my opinion for enormous amounts of fake news over the last few years and about climate change and many other things that are hugely important issues we end up with this ridiculous situation where newspapers like the Sun the Daily Mail etc and that many of us on the progressive side have spent decades critiquing and essentially trying to expose the manipulations of are now holding themselves up with this nice new a brand about press freedom and responsibility as the truth it seems
