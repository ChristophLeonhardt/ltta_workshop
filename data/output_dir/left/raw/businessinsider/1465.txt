00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
as a businessman and real estate

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">developer I have legally used a tax laws</font>

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:13,889
to my benefit Donald's father<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fred made</font>

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,440
his fortune his very large fortune in

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,750
real estate<font color="#CCCCCC"> development in brooklyn and</font>

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">queens never saw a loophole or an</font>

abatement or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any possible</font>

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,189
advantage that he didn't run<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

9
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,640
through he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very famous for being</font>

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,729
very aggressive about pushing every

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,440
possible way that he could have

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,050
government support it's not illegal but

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,309
he absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushed it to the limit and</font>

14
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,950
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> one time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually he had to testify</font>

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,829
in congress over his windfall profits

16
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,050
that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> got out of these federal housing</font>

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,120
subsidy programs where he had to

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,010
estimate the cost and then what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

19
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,780
know he would<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in way under and he</font>

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,030
would get to keep what was left out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,000
those subsidies sound familiar he did

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">very well with that and he had to</font>

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,539
testify in congress<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this and he</font>

24
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">said you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know essentially what's wrong</font>

25
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,369
with making a profit and you know yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

26
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,049
did push everything and what's the

27
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,439
matter with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,530
and that's a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of model for how</font>

29
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,960
Donald has operated his businesses of

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,530
every time there was an abatement a

31
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,770
possibility of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of tax</font>

32
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,030
forgiveness or you know in some way that

33
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,060
government funds could be used in the

34
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,340
course of building his<font color="#CCCCCC"> real estate</font>

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,340
empire<font color="#E5E5E5"> used it he was extremely</font>

36
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,130
aggressive about that I have brilliantly

37
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,830
used those laws we of course speak of

38
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,200
this as if Donald Trump was sitting

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,940
there with an adding machine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a paper</font>

40
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,620
and pencil and figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> his tax</font>

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,410
returns of course not oh I did all the

42
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,460
tax preparation he never saw the product

43
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,440
until it was presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him for</font>

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,210
signature one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

45
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,400
done that his father did they paid a lot

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">of attention to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hiring good lawyers a</font>

47
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,010
legal team that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pursue</font>

48
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,920
very often seemingly arcane matters

49
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,020
about zoning law and abatements and tax

50
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,700
issues and things that seem highly you

51
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,800
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weeds kind of stuff that in</font>

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,810
fact or the kind you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

53
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,690
make a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money and he has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been very</font>

54
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,989
careful to lawyer himself up if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

55
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a verb out of an accountant himself</font>

56
00:02:43,580 --> 00:00:00,000
up and his father<font color="#E5E5E5"> did likewise</font>
