THE CONTEXT OF HEAVY DRINKING. AND THERE IS -- IT MAY SUGGEST

102
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:26,408

IT’S NOT UNUSUAL FOR HIGH SCHOOL IN 1983.

IN 1983. IT’S NOT UNUSUAL FOR HIGH SCHOOL

THERE’S CLEARLY A CULTURE THERE HE IS TRYING TO DENY.

119
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,900
HE IS TRYING TO DENY. I THINK IT DOES RAISE ISSUES

00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,368
I THINK IT DOES RAISE ISSUES ABOUT HIS CREDIBILITY.

121
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,438

MINDS OF 17 YEAR OLD BOYS WHO WRITE SUCH THINGS BUT THE

WRITE SUCH THINGS BUT THE INSINUATION IS HORRIBLE, HURTFUL

138
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,360
INSINUATION IS HORRIBLE, HURTFUL AND SIMPLY UNTRUE.

139
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:21,396
AND SIMPLY UNTRUE. I PRAY THEIR DAUGHTERS ARE NEVER

I PRAY THEIR DAUGHTERS ARE NEVER TREATED THIS WAY.

141
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:24,266
TREATED THIS WAY. DOES THIS TO YOU GO BEYOND BOYS

142
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:25,200
DOES THIS TO YOU GO BEYOND BOYS BEING BOYS?

143
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:27,102
BEING BOYS? AND I’LL ASK YOU, YOU KNOW,

144
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,403
AND I’LL ASK YOU, YOU KNOW, AGAIN YOU WEREN’T THERE, I

AGAIN YOU WEREN’T THERE, I WASN’T THERE.

146
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:33,509
WASN’T THERE. BUT DOES IT SOUND CREDIBLE TO

147
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:35,277
BUT DOES IT SOUND CREDIBLE TO YOU THAT HIS LAWYER WOULD SAY,

148
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:37,112
YOU THAT HIS LAWYER WOULD SAY, LOOK, THIS IS JUST ABOUT

149
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:38,814
LOOK, THIS IS JUST ABOUT SOMEBODY HE KNEW?

150
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:40,249
SOMEBODY HE KNEW? IT DOESN’T MEAN ANYTHING MORE

151
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:42,084
IT DOESN’T MEAN ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT?

152
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:45,020
THAN THAT? >> I THINK THAT’S FAR TOO

153
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:48,390
>> I THINK THAT’S FAR TOO GENEROUS OF AN ASSESSMENT FOR

154
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:48,724
GENEROUS OF AN ASSESSMENT FOR KAVANAUGH.

155
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:50,292
KAVANAUGH. THE REALITY IS THIS IS NOT JUST

156
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:51,127
THE REALITY IS THIS IS NOT JUST BOYS BEING BOYS.

157
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:53,729
BOYS BEING BOYS. THESE ARE ALLEGATIONS OF A

158
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:54,029
THESE ARE ALLEGATIONS OF A CRIME.

159
00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:55,031

00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:56,399
I THINK THE FEAR AMONG BE REPUBLICANS GOING INTO THURSDAY

00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,733
REPUBLICANS GOING INTO THURSDAY IS ALL OF THIS BEGINS TO

162
00:04:57,768 --> 00:04:58,067
IS ALL OF THIS BEGINS TO UNRAVEL.

163
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:00,035
UNRAVEL. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS EVEN IF

164
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:02,204
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS EVEN IF WE BEGIN TO DISCUSS KAVANAUGH’S

165
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:03,939
WE BEGIN TO DISCUSS KAVANAUGH’S SEXUAL PROCLIVITY AND WHETHER OR

166
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:05,441
SEXUAL PROCLIVITY AND WHETHER OR NOT A CRIME OCCURRED, DEMOCRATS

167
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:06,375
NOT A CRIME OCCURRED, DEMOCRATS ARE ALSO GOING TO HAVE THE

168
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,443
ARE ALSO GOING TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT THIS

169
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:09,078
OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT THIS ENTIRE CULTURE THROUGH WHICH

170
00:05:09,112 --> 00:05:10,245
ENTIRE CULTURE THROUGH WHICH KAVANAUGH EMERGED.

171
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:12,848
KAVANAUGH EMERGED. IN PARTICULAR, DRINKING, HEAVILY

172
00:05:12,883 --> 00:05:13,949
IN PARTICULAR, DRINKING, HEAVILY DRINKING AND GAMBLING.

173
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:15,385
DRINKING AND GAMBLING. SO GRASSLEY’S GOING TO HAVE TO

174
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,452
SO GRASSLEY’S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.

175
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:17,987
MAKE A DECISION. DOES HE CUT OFF THAT TYPE OF

176
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:18,354
DOES HE CUT OFF THAT TYPE OF QUESTION?

177
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:19,355
QUESTION? DOES HE LIMIT QUESTIONING JUST

178
00:05:19,356 --> 00:05:21,057
DOES HE LIMIT QUESTIONING JUST TO THE MATTERS OF DR. FORD?

179
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:22,892
TO THE MATTERS OF DR. FORD? OR ARE DEMOCRATS ALLOWED TO

180
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:24,360
OR ARE DEMOCRATS ALLOWED TO BRING IN THIS LONGER STORY OF

181
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:25,428
BRING IN THIS LONGER STORY OF MARK JUDGE AND KAVANAUGH AND

182
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:26,329
MARK JUDGE AND KAVANAUGH AND THIS CULTURE?

183
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,764
THIS CULTURE? IT’S WHY WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT IN

184
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:29,633
IT’S WHY WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST SEGMENT REPUBLICANS

185
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,767
THE LAST SEGMENT REPUBLICANS PUSHING THIS VERY QUICKLY, I

186
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,002
PUSHING THIS VERY QUICKLY, I THINK IT’S LESS RESOLVE THAT

187
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:33,469
THINK IT’S LESS RESOLVE THAT WE’RE SEEING FROM REPUBLICANS

188
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:34,470
WE’RE SEEING FROM REPUBLICANS AND MORE PANIC.

189
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:35,872
AND MORE PANIC. BECAUSE THEY KNOW THIS CAN GET

190
00:05:35,906 --> 00:05:38,007
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THIS CAN GET OUT OF CONTROL VERY QUICKLY IF

191
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:40,276
OUT OF CONTROL VERY QUICKLY IF YOU’RE A REPUBLICAN.

192
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:42,145
YOU’RE A REPUBLICAN. >> WHAT’S YOUR EXPECTATION,

193
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:42,445
>> WHAT’S YOUR EXPECTATION, DAVID?

194
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:43,746
DAVID? WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO

195
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,448
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN ON THURSDAY?

196
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,950
HAPPEN ON THURSDAY? WHEN YOU RAISE THESE QUESTIONS,

197
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:48,785
WHEN YOU RAISE THESE QUESTIONS, YOU KNOW THE KIND OF PRESSURE

198
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,020
YOU KNOW THE KIND OF PRESSURE THAT CHUCK GRASSLEY IS UNDER.

199
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:51,588
THAT CHUCK GRASSLEY IS UNDER. WHAT DO YOU SEE HAPPENING?

200
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,189
WHAT DO YOU SEE HAPPENING? YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PLAYERS.

201
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:54,591
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PLAYERS. >> I THINK THE FIX IS IN.

202
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,727
>> I THINK THE FIX IS IN. I MEAN, I THINK MITCH McCONNELL

203
00:05:57,761 --> 00:05:59,495
I MEAN, I THINK MITCH McCONNELL KNOWS JUST AS HE ORCHESTRATED

204
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:01,264
KNOWS JUST AS HE ORCHESTRATED THE MERRICK GARLAND HOLDOUT, HE

205
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:02,699
THE MERRICK GARLAND HOLDOUT, HE IS GOING TO MAKE SURE KAVANAUGH

206
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,466
IS GOING TO MAKE SURE KAVANAUGH GETS PUSHED THROUGH.

207
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,368
GETS PUSHED THROUGH. THE ONLY THING THAT STOPPED THIS

208
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:06,703
THE ONLY THING THAT STOPPED THIS IS NOT WHO MEMBERS OF THE

209
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:08,471
IS NOT WHO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHOOSE TO BELIEVE,

210
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:10,006
COMMITTEE CHOOSE TO BELIEVE, IT’S IF IT BECOMES SO

211
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,974
IT’S IF IT BECOMES SO POLITICALLY UNTENABLE.

212
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:12,208
POLITICALLY UNTENABLE. THE PERSON I WANT TO WATCH IS

213
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:12,875
THE PERSON I WANT TO WATCH IS JEFF FLAKE.

214
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,178
JEFF FLAKE. WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT COLLINS AND

215
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:15,779
WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT COLLINS AND MURKOWSKI.

216
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,713
MURKOWSKI. FRANKLY, REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE

217
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:18,181
FRANKLY, REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE ASHAMED IF WE ONLY LOOK TO

218
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:19,015
ASHAMED IF WE ONLY LOOK TO FEMALE REPUBLICANS TO STAND UP

219
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,550
FEMALE REPUBLICANS TO STAND UP IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS.

220
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:22,319
IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS. JEFF FLAKE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

221
00:06:22,353 --> 00:06:23,453
JEFF FLAKE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE HIS McCAIN MOMENT.

222
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,388
HAVE HIS McCAIN MOMENT. HIS DEFINING LEGACY MOMENT.

223
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,924
HIS DEFINING LEGACY MOMENT. AND HONESTLY PEOPLE ARE TALKING

224
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:31,161
AND HONESTLY PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT JEFF FLAKE

225
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:32,595
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT JEFF FLAKE AS AN INDEPENDENT.

226
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:34,331
AS AN INDEPENDENT. IF HE IS CONSIDERING THAT, HE

227
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:35,666
IF HE IS CONSIDERING THAT, HE HAS TO VOTE NO ON KAVANAUGH.

228
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,000
HAS TO VOTE NO ON KAVANAUGH. HE CANNOT SUPPORT KAVANAUGH.

229
00:06:37,001 --> 00:00:00,000
HE CANNOT SUPPORT KAVANAUGH. I THINK HE COULD BE THE FIRST
