for the past two months Frances trade union leaders have led protests like this one in Paris against the president's planned public sector reforms the unions are here to support public sector workers and send a message that the politics of favoring 10% of the population to the detriment of the other 90% must stop the government says that streamlining the public sector and cutting thousands of jobs will help reduce debt and create new opportunities but workers say the reforms will destroy their rights the government says it won't back down but it always say that so if people keep fighting and protesting before the government is hurting public services so we are fighting not just for ourselves but for France's vital public services for decades Frances trade unions have been a fearsome force in 1995 nationwide strikes compelled the conservative leadership to scrap a raft of reforms it was the biggest social movement since May 1968 when workers and students nearly brought down the government but it seems that history is not about to repeat itself when these protests began two months ago many people said they could be a man all my calls biggest test good the French president when his battle against the trade unions while lots of people have turned out for this protest but there is no doubt it seems that momentum is actually on Michaels side the number of protesters has been dwindling opinion polls suggest public support for the strikers is low and many people accept that Mac Hall was elected as a reformer some analysts also say that the trade unions are much weaker than in the past 60 years ago a third of the workforce was unionized but today it's a different picture for France's unions have a very low rate of membership it's around 10 percent of staff it's a very French thing that traditionally the unions are very visible so you think they're very powerful but actually they're very small so it's difficult to try and mobilize lots of people with such small numbers Macra has already passed key reforms including a new work law his reform at the National Railway is in the Senate this week have already cleared the National Assembly he seems to be on track to win this fight and if he does some say the glory days of Frances unions could be over Natasha Butler al Jazeera Paris
