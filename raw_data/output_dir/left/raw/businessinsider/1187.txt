00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
I'm asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a simple question does</font>

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,330
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> president-elect accept the consensus</font>

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,039
and that's what John Brennan said it was

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">the consensus of the Intel community</font>

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,480
about Russian interference and its

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,350
intent

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:39,590
[Music]

8
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,030
does the president elect accept the

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,309
consensus of the Intel community well I

10
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">think a lot of these things though Chris</font>

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,430
are coming through third parties I mean

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,710
we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard from call me when when</font>

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,629
collapse<font color="#CCCCCC"> what CIA director Brennan you</font>

14
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,339
think he's lying<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what Jim call me</font>

15
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:58,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">think no I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think he is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

16
00:00:58,769 --> 00:00:59,970
it sure would be nice to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,500
everybody I mean if there is this

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,650
conclusive opinion among all of these

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,940
intelligence agencies than they should

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,740
issue a report or they should stand in

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,720
front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a camera and make the case I'm</font>

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,210
asking you a simple question does the

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,110
president-elect accept the consensus and

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,729
that's what John Brennan said it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

25
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,429
consensus of the Intel community about

26
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:22,679
Russian interference and its intent I

27
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:25,740
think he<font color="#E5E5E5"> would accept the conclusion if</font>

28
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,380
these intelligence professionals would

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,950
get together put out a report show the

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,300
American People that are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

31
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,030
same page as opposed to third parties

32
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,800
through the Washington Post third party

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,970
right but John you haven't heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

34
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,619
class right but we haven't we haven't

35
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,150
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> from call me does president Trump</font>

36
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,310
accept or trust the intelligence

37
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,049
community this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the CIA director</font>

38
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,119
saying that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a third party or does</font>

39
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,329
he trust the Russian denials look III

40
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,659
think that they're almost there except

41
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,189
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that they haven't been</font>

42
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,189
totally upfront and transparent in their

43
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,829
opinion as to who what where and how

44
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,930
this all happened and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they'll</font>

45
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,389
get there and when they do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can hear</font>

46
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,769
from the president-elect and get his

47
00:02:10,769 --> 00:00:00,000
opinion
