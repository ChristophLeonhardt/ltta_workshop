When that tornado
warning goes off,

00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,326
it’s like a drug to
take away your pain.

Oh buddy.

16
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,572
I get the test
results in a few days.

17
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:40,502
Maybe — maybe nothing happened.

18
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:42,967
You know, maybe I got lucky.

19
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:43,953

[music]

21
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,990
Fourteen, fifteen… 
alcohol came into my life,

22
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,860
and that pretty
much destroyed it.

23
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,910
Went all the way
through high school,

24
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,930
then I got in a little
bit of trouble drinking

25
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,390
and I went in the service.

26
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,780
And then my mental
illness hit.

27
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,910
And then I spent the
next 20 years

28
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,670
in and out
of institutions.

29
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:26,640
I had 10 years sobriety,
basically ended up here

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,800
because I relapsed.

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,040

You know, I’m not the only

37

and I won’t be the last.

38
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:46,835
But you’ve just got to get
up every day and battle.

39
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,576
Storm chasing was
on my bucket list.

40
00:02:55,576 --> 00:03:02,230
And … I’ve definitely got to
see a tornado this summer,

41
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,237
before it’s over with.

42
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:08,840
Because if it’s
bad news

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,380
I might die in a week or two
weeks, or a month.

44
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:18,370
There’s only a few
short months in there

45
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,740
that you can really chase.

46
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,794
Once that’s over
with, it’s over.

47
00:03:24,794 --> 00:03:28,430

Could be the last
chase of the year.

I told a friend I was going to
get in one of those van tours

64
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,399
down south and
chase tornadoes.

65
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,529
And he said, I think I
can do you one better.

00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,820
He has a nephew that does it.

67
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,309
He hooked Mike and I up and we
hit it off, right off the bat.

go for the southern one.

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,896
Yeah, all we can do now is hope 
this storm produces a tornado.

This forecast is too good.

We’re going to do this.

132
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:25,300
And I was just like,
well, they’re either going

133
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,870
to fire me or they’re not.

00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:40,360
So I’m either getting fired
and we’re seeing no tornado,

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,207
or I’m getting fired and
we’re getting a tornado.

Or I’m not getting fired
and we’re getting a tornado.

00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,404
It’s important.

a couple of years

stop chasing, right?

151

You know that couple that
got married and chased.

00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,190
Yeah, that would be —

153
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,580
There’s a couple couples
that got married and chased.

154
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,010
That would be a dream
scenario, is to find a —

155
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,230
find a girl that’s
into the weather

156
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,690
and wants to hit the road
with me whenever it’s time.

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,220
And that would be awesome.

So right now, we are sitting
in southeast Wyoming.

It’s 1:21 PM local time.

170
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,820
And I couldn’t be
any more excited

171
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,360
and nervous at the same time.

172
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,310
I’m nervous because,
like, failing today

173
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:23,510
would be just an
absolute stab to the heart.

174
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,990
So it’s like, if I were
to play in the Super Bowl,

175
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,490
I can imagine this
is kind of what

176
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,380
it feels like before
that game takes off.

177
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,290
Not sure what
it’s going to do.

178
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,570
We got one sort of
lame storm there.

179
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,983
It’s still only 4:30
and we have time left.

180
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:13,448
But at the moment, I
am a little worried.

181
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,350
So I think I’m going
to stop

182
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,940
and see what Tony
wants to do.

183
00:11:30,795 --> 00:11:32,280
I really wish I had …

184
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:38,205
But there’s next year. I hope.

185
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,075
Hopefully, I’ll be alive,
kicking and chasing and —

186
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:04,810
When they do the PET scan,
you know, what do you

187
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,400
want the results to —

188
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,860
how does that dictate
what you do this winter?

189
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,532
Well, they could tell me that —
it’s from my head to the toe.

190
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:15,492
Yeah.

191
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:21,990
And it tells, from the
last one to this one,

192
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:27,954
if the cancer is gone or
little pebbles formed up

193
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:30,440
and made new cancer.

194
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,550
What if that’s the case?

195
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,947
Fuck it.

196
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:34,430
You’re not going
to do anything?

197
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,319
Nope.

198
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:38,350
I’m going to say, ”How long do
I got if I don’t do anything?”

199
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,320
Are you saying Wednesday,
they could tell you,

200
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,280
like, something bad?

201
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,150
Yeah.

202
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,690
Really?

203
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,860
And then you just
wouldn’t even have to —

204
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,610
you wouldn’t work?

205
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,260
You wouldn’t —

206
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,766
I don’t want to go
through that shit again.

207
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:03,070
Hey, Mom.

208
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,220
We’re out in Bumfuck
South Dakota chasing,

209
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,180
and we probably won’t
know until 2:00 or 3:00.

210
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,645
So if you try to call me
later, you might not get me.

211
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:19,575
Yup. Well, we’re on —

212
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:20,575
Holy shit.

213
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:22,060
That place exploded.

214
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,765
I go for a test tomorrow.

215
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:24,765
[car revving]

216
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,000
Yep.

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,980
Look at the bomb
in front of us.

218
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,255
O.K. I got to go.

219
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:33,940
It’s already got
a hook on radar.

220
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,920
9:45.

221
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,395
We got initiation here.

222
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:41,360
So we got a storm
we’re following.

223
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,860
Woo.

224
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,335
It’s firing up,
so I got to go.

225
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:46,315
O.K.

226
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:48,725
You have a good night.
Bye.

227
00:13:49,285 --> 00:13:51,780
You can see, Mark,
what’s happened

228
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,900
in the last few minutes.

229
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,400
Yeah.

230
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,030
Wow.

231
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,761
See it there?

232
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:55,546
Yep.

233
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:57,840
We’re going to core
punch like we always do.

234
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,382
It’s just a baby.

235
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:13,366
Pretty soon, there’ll be bolts
of lightning going crazy.

236
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:16,354
This is where you get excited.

237
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:19,342
This is amazing radar, guys.

238
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:21,334
Like, 15 minutes.

239
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:22,287
We just got to go.

240
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:22,828
We got to go.

241
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:23,824
We got to go.

242
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:25,816
Oh, it’s the
last one of the year.

243
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:28,804
Let him be.

244
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:31,294
Yee-haw.

245
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:36,772
We got hail and wind and
heavy rain straight ahead.

246
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:38,764
Got to punch through it.

250
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,194

[shattering glass]

253
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,770

It’s going to be a big one.

“— oftentimes outpacing cars.”

00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:17,746
Mark, can you see it?

260
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:19,245
“— to the path of
the oncoming storm.”

261
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:20,265
Shit.

“The best choice is to get into
a nearby shelter or building.”

263
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:25,233
What are we going to do?

264
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:26,231
How does that happen?

265
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:27,228
How does the road end?

267
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:30,223

supposed to end.

this, and I need to go south.

Yep.

Do you see it?

It’s happening.

Our instinct may be to run.

To retreat and avoid
the fear and the pain.

begins within us.

Isn’t it though?
