I'm here today to show my utter contempt
discussed and the government's decision
to once again attack in the Middle East
stop push and I can think of no better
way of doing that and by relinquishing
these talking's of militarism my name is
Daniel Lennard my trial live my life not
having to deal with the consequences of
war in those why I pray these medals
back boy if every soldier past and
present did this
Vinnie times are desperate
you
