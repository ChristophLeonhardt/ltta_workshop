kids bring mini punching today's
military parade will show off the
powerful status of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea as long as
hostile policies from the US continue
the mission of the Korean People's Army
can never change
the United States of America will
continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder
in our effort to bring maximum pressure
to bear on North Korea until that time
comes when they finally and permanently
and irreversibly abandon their nuclear
and ballistic missile ambitions
