Donald Trump loves to play golf he was very critical about Obama when he was playing golf during his presidency but during the Trump presidency a term it seems as though golfing is a permanent fixture of his strategy in fact according to reports he has spent at least 91 days of his presidency at golf courses amazing and has been confirmed golfing at least 35 times now the reason why there's a distinction there is because the White House is very tight-lipped about the fact that he golf so much so they won't confirm each and every time he does it in fact there was that story from last week where they literally got a big truck white box truck to block reporters view of him golfing now the question is all right well he said that Obama was super lazy for constantly golfing he's already beaten Obama in the amount of time he's golfed in his first year of his presidency so what does that mean does that mean he's being lazy Sarah Huckabee Sanders thinks no he's actually being incredibly productive take a look you tell me the biggest single thing the president has accomplished for the American people during his time on the golf course I think it would certainly be developing deeper and better relationships with members of Congress in which those relationships have helped push forward the President's agenda specifically when it comes to helping get the tax reform and tax cuts passed a lot of that I think and that success of that came from the strong relationships that the president has and he's played golf with a number of senators and used that time certainly to accomplish that will take so much has been accomplished during this time there seems to be a bit of a transparency issue with his time on the golf course we don't always get confirmation of what he's doing there despite a lot of requests there was this incident with the box truck why does it seem as though the White House is a little self has some kind of issue about this time on the corner I think it's the press that has an issue at this time on the course the president is extremely proud of the accomplishments we had during 2017 okay so she thinks that hey he's he's holding very important meetings with members of Congress on the golf course and they're they're having discussions about legislation and what they need to do to pass that legislation I'm sure you know he really gets into the weeds of that legislation yeah on the golf course because you know having a meeting in Washington where all the congressmen are that would be unproductive having meetings either with a lot of congressmen at once unproductive or hey four at a time for 15 minutes each or half an hour each that would be unproductive what would be productive is spending an entire day with just three other people on a golf course over and over and over again and some of those people are not most of them are not congressmen by the way a lot of them are friends which is understandable because he's lazy and only wants to do his golf and remember they have to give him information and tweet sighs because like what he's our the White House is not working anyways we there's a report that he's watching 48 hours of television mainly Fox and just kvetching all day in his bathroom so he figures what the hell not working on the White House anyway I might as well go have fun and play golf but a lot of the people on the Golf Course are also his funders his donors so he's out there raising money for Republicans are raising money for himself and doing the corrupt thing that that he claimed and he was against but but even if you don't get into that serious stuff about the corruption and the donors the tweets that he get had against Obama golfing wicious we're so over the top they were over the top they were vicious and for some reason it was totally okay to pass judgment on Obama when he was golfing but when he's doing it it's not that's the only reason why this is a story in my eyes like I don't I don't care the Trump golf's in fact I would prefer that he golf's 356 days out of the week 365 days out of the week I the out of the year you guys know what I mean every day every day I want a golfing every day I want him away from Twitter I want him away from his phone I want him away from Congress I want him away go away go golf right but it's just this like weird like self-important you know I'm above everyone and everything attitude that he has that annoys the crap out of me because he has no problem passing judgment while simultaneously doing the exact same thing so let's just think about it in any other context because I haven't gone golfing 91 times in my life and I we run it - I run a talk show here arguably not are you believe obviously not anywhere near as important as being president not 1% of 1% of 1% right and I care I care deeply I work in the weekends I work non-stop right this guy doesn't care at all he is the most important job in the world 91 days think about if let's forget take the lower number imagine if someone had done 35 days of something else like going to a movie could you imagine if the President had gone to a movie 35 times in one year 35 movies you're like oh my god Jesus what's with the movies right and imagine if the movie took all day okay so you'd be like what that's great imagine if you went the movies what are you doing good work you just put that in in in a context that blew my mind right because I want everyone to just think about your life okay think about your life for a second you're not president you're not you're just living your life have you ever in any given year gone to the movies 91 times 91 I've no way I don't think I've gone to the movies 91 times in my entire life right and this homeboys at a golf course 91 days out of the first year of his presidency that is absurd that is absurd it's literally a quarter of the days of the year amazing that's amazing so he just doesn't care to do the job to him it's an exercise in ego and and making money he's making money I mean he's slang in his businesses left and right right I mean no one gives a crap about the conflicts of interest no one cares about the fact that he's you know slanging those memberships tomorrow Lago and all that you know and part of the reason why he's constantly at mar-a-lago or one of his resorts and why he's constantly publicizing that is because it drives up memberships its promotional you know Ivanka Trump running around in the clothing that she sells I mean come on it's it's a big business strategy for them and nothing more look III play pitching part right the three-part nine whole thing I like it it's fun it and a lot of Americans love golf but I don't but the elites and their obsession with golf drives me crazy so remember George Bush with the okay it's really serious we got to go fight the terrace now watch this tee shot right but to bushes credit he stopped playing golf during the Iraq war cuz he at least understood the optics looks so bad right I can't believe there's something that makes it look good I know right means but I thought Obama played too much golf it's nonstop with the golf the golf the golf right so but now Trump is blowing them out of water but like if you take it and apply anything else I was thinking okay we talked about the movies the movies take a couple hours golf takes all day imagine if they had a different habit like if they had if the president bowled all day long you'd be like what the president spent 91 days all day long bowling it what hate you but like he spends 91 days all day golfing and every psyched well not everybody but at least half the country's like well graph course he's got to relax it's gonna you know clear his mind a little bit you know you just go and spend the whole day golfing and instead of working I mean a quarter of the day's most important job in the world none of us have ever spent 91 days having fun out of any given week unless we were kids maybe we're retired yeah but he like he's retired he's an old guy who watches Fox News all day long and does not stop golfing and covet just to his friends hay goes down to Florida all the time he's retired except he has the most important job in the world if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
