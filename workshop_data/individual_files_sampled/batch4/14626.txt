I'm as levan it's May 11th and you're watching battleground well you almost caught me off guard there is a we start right on time when we are alive as we are every weekday 12 noon Eastern Time to 1 p.m. Eastern Time it's an experiment we've been doing for two weeks now it is a live chit chat show there's a word for called super Chad that is how Google calls it as you can see on the right hand side of the screen you can make a regular comment and it shows up regularly I do my best to keep up to them but for folks who want to really get my attention and ensure that everyone else sees their comment - you can do what's called a super chat for a couple bucks or some people even ship in 5 or 10 I saw someone earlier chipped in 50 bucks you can pay and your comment stays in a fluorescent color for a period of time proportionate to the amount of money you get and we get that dough here at the rebel so it helps us keep the lights on and pay for other things that we have to pay for as you know we're 100 percent if you were supported unlike say oh I don't know the state broadcaster the CBC which gets 1.5 billion dollars a year um so what we do for this hour everyday well Monday to Thursdays I go through just a few video clips it slightly produces salt like my 8:00 p.m. show which is behind a paywall very produce very scripted this is just chitchat and fridays we started this tradition last week is sort of a Friday free-for-all where I'm just gonna really focus on as many comments as possible that said just while we build up a few more viewers as people log in I am gonna cover a little bit of news while we get a few more folks watching um as you know Canada has an open borders crisis then you might be thinking how could that possibly be Canada only has a border with the United States on the 49th parallel and with Alaska and how's that a problem I mean if a lot of North Dakotans want to come up north good people yeah come on up stay if you want but that's not how it's working what's what's happening is in direct contradiction and sort of a passive-aggressive reaction to Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigrants and his executive order limiting migration from Muslim majority terrorist countries not all of which are Muslim by the way they put North Korea on the list Justin Trudeau put out a tweet that's been retweeted in length hundreds of thousands of times saying everyone's welcome in Canada and so what's happened is that all the people who were going to be deported by Donald Trump or I don't know self-deport to Mexico instead say let's go north I mean that fool up there's willing to take us let's go there our odds are better up there than they are in America welfare is fatter Healthcare is fatter and you got this dopey prime minister who makes open borders a thing and so we've had tens of thousands and they're not Americans they're not Americans at all they're people who are about to be deported from America either because in some cases they're criminals in other cases they were in America for a short period of time for example Haitians after the Haiti earthquake were allowed to stay in the United States for a number of years it's been a number of years now and that is running out so just Haitians just go to Montreal why not they speak French next up of course are the Salvadorians the ms-13 we did a story the other day about how Canada's national crime Intelligence Agency is telling local police yeah the ms-13 games are coming so we're getting the worst of the worst but I want to read you some related stories about what is it what's really going it's just incredible I want to start with a story from Global News could we put that up for a second Nigerian sex-offender wanted in Texas slips into Canada so just the same way Donald Trump says Mexico's not sending its best America's not sending its best up here we're not getting you know the bright bright-eyed bushy-tailed you know millennial programmers or engineers or doctors we're getting the folks in this case a Nigerian sex criminal from Texas I mean it's not fun to be a sex criminal in Texas I'm not sure if they still have capital punishment down there it's not friendly but up here it's super friendly and he just walked right in and even though if you have a bogus refugee application your odds of it being approved are only about 50% which by the way is far too large it should be zero percent because no one coming from the United States can by definition be a refugee you're in America it's not a hostile place um it takes about two years to get your hearing so you have a 100% chance of staying in Canada until your immigration hearing and of course while you're in Canada you're free to move around so what's the odds that a criminal or a bogus migrant who knows he's here in a false way he's gonna actually show up for his hearing in two years and if he does show up and he loses the hearing who what's to why on earth would you think he's gonna go so I want to read another story that's in some ways even more infuriating and it's the next one in spy mark Borkowski of the Ottawa secretin up here costs growing for feds open-door border and here's a migrant who comes to Canada illegally of course and let me just read that let me read that headline there what to make of the case of Taha el da an illegal who entered Canada through the backdoor of the now infamous unmanned border crossing in Quebec and discovered days later that he had terminal stage four cancer he had no idea guys he had no idea and he just discovered that he came across a Canada and he goes to the front of the queue he goes to the front of the line and of course you know Canadians who've been paying into the system our whole lives they can take a they can take a back seat to this fella our own poor our own homeless our own groups of Canadian society with great health problems aboriginal Canadians for example whose life expectancy is more than 10 years shorter than other Canadians you know they're not as important politically as months of migrants sneaking in illegally from the United States to take I don't know a quarter million dollars worth of health care in their final months why not do it here we're suckers but look how our state broadcaster turns these people into heroes asylum seeker makes it across the Canadian border only to find out he is stage-four cancer wha wha wha wha who knew and he's a real hero and tiled haha is fighting to bring his family to Canada to be by his side while he undergoes treatment so it's not just him bring the whole bunch of them he's here illegally he's here illegally he came in illegally and an illegal border crossing his very first act was to defy police and break the law so obviously he's a hero because he's an illegal Muslim migrant who's about to take quarter million half a million bucks and he wants to bring the rest of the Klan in and the CBC is thrilled so that's that's Canada it's not just the United States and Canada has never thought of ourselves as having to have a strong border I mind you God we have a border with the United States the longest undefended border in the world it's something of great pride you know once the why you gotta watch those don't the codons but you know it's been it's nothing I mean a few decades ago they were migrant traffickers who would bring boatloads of folks from sri lanka and that was a bit of a challenge but it was the occasional boat with a few hundred people these are tens of thousands and like i say they are the worst of the worst of the tricksters the hucksters and in that one case a Nigerian sex offender yeah all right well we have over a hundred folks online right now so I'm going to do what we say we do and make Friday a free for all Friday I am just going I'm gonna check I don't see any super chats in there yet super chats work if you want your comment to be in the highlighted color chip in a couple bucks I'm just gonna go through some stuff uh someone named Lauren southern I think that's a male version of Lauer in this southern says after your show yesterday I couldn't stop saying El Chupacabra you know what I have not yet looked up that word it might be it might be a naughty word you know I didn't know what despedido meant until much later that's not a naughty word but El Chupacabra thank you um insurgents on a stick says el Muslim cobbler if anyone knows what chupacabra means let me know because it's such a great word Marcin wonder what says could you us polls how you respect us because US government is fake now right they don't quite understand that but I've done a variety of shows on Poland including I think it was Donald Trump's big speech there in Poland which I thought was beautiful talking about freedom and Poland has saved the world on three occasions Poland led the army that smashed the siege of Vienna in 1683 and basically saved the West from the Turks we would probably all be praying to Mecca now were it not for the poles saving humanity that's not the first time Karol Wojtyla who became Pope John Paul the second I believe he as much as Reagan or Thatcher was responsible for the fall of the Berlin Wall when he went back from Rome to Poland during the Cold War and he said be not afraid and he had that massive open air mass what a million poles or was a three million I don't know and he and what was his message be not afraid he said to the post don't be afraid anymore and he he worked in concert with Wes Valenza of solidarity I believe Pope John Paul helped save the world just like yen sobieski helped save 300 years ago so that's my thoughts on Poland and I think Donald Trump has similar affection and I should say the Poland because it's only a generation removed from Soviet domination still values its freedom much more so than Western European countries and advises its freedom against the threat to freedom today what sure is partly from Vladimir Putin who in some ways wishes to rebuild the Soviet empire but I think it's more from Islamic mass migration and the cultural changes that come there from and I think Poland like Hungary is very much on guard for that somebody thoughts on Poland that's what a free-for-all Fridays about I let's take a look at some more comments she Lagaan well I know Sheila says it's like a Mexican werewolf you talk about Chef macabre it's a Mexican werewolf or vampire that creature that eats goats and sheep and people it means goat sucker a goat sucker well now I finally understand my high school nickname okay um user unknown have you had any interactions with David Suzuki lately well you know what I haven't seen the man believe it or not since I encountered him on the street in Toronto that one day a few years ago you can still find that video on YouTube when I was with Sun News and I accosted Suzuki on the street and he hid in his Chevy Volt you can find that on YouTube pretty quick I don't know can we call that up Hanna I wouldn't mind playing can you find that that clip it'll take us min to find it Suzuki was sitting in a Chevy Volts actually he was standing outside he saw me coming he ran in the Chevy and then I put on my most irritating boys right okay then I started knocking on his window I'll just show you a clip of that well we'll take us a minute to find it but yeah that was last time I had physical contact with him because he lives you know on an elite Street in Vancouver Point great road and he has five homes so you never know where he is he's got a home in Australia is three homes in the Vancouver area is it's a very very wealthy man I don't fly in his circles okay let me this should be it and I let me just say in advance I know that my voice here was irritating and that was sort of half on purpose half accidental I was just trying to be super friendly so here I am I costing David Suzuki Taylor can I talk to you for a minute David can I talk to you for a minute could I talk to you later I thought you had this event right now I thought you had an event here right now are you running away from me Jeff a minute to talk you were talking with them is how come you don't want to talk with me is it because I asked skeptical questions well tell me the truth what's the truth what's the truth what's the truth David what truth are we not saying what truth are we not saying David I kept knocking because you know maybe he forgot I was there so I had to keep knocking in case you forgot I was there and yes I know I know that was my irritating voice that's why that's my social justice for his voice we raised the end of every sentence no matter what I've never met Dion views but I imagine that he ends his sentences like that okay so yeah so that's the last time I had a physical encounter with David Suzuki uh but who knows he's gonna be an M inton at University of Alberta my alma mater I'm a graduate of that school on June 7th maybe we'll have a chance to have a reunion hey man it's Ezra that um hmm rebel media is making a fortnight clone I know there's an illusion here that are that I'm missing I'm just pretty square I would like to interrupt the David Suzuki event with a dozen Suzuki two-stroke dirt bikes well there you go yeah don't let David Suzuki give Suzuki a bad name there's many outstanding industrial things made by Suzuki to burn a lot of fossil fuels so if every you're really mad at the Suzuki's of the world think of nice Suzuki's like dirt bikes um no miracle he talks like Catherine McKenna yeah you know what and let me say this sometimes people have a foreign accent and as as wise people always say if someone speaking with a foreign accent that means they speak one more language than you so don't be mean right and there's a lot of truth there and say someone has a speech impediment a stutter or a stammer or a lisp don't make fun there but for the grace of God go you but the way and can we call up can we call up the vocal fry clip thank you for working hard you guys will I just make demands on you um Catherine McKenna does not have an accent she was born in Canada I think she does not have a medical problem she does not have a lisp or a stutter she has an affectation I like Madonna Madonna Chacon born in New York but she has this fake mid-atlantic accent because she's trying to be classy same thing with Catherine McKenna Canada's global warming minister she talks like a Kardashian and that is not an illness that is a weird weird choice and as well I can't do vocal fry you know vocal for it said it's over raspy oh I can't do it I can't do it I'll let you know when the clip is ready and I'll show you what it is ready mmm oh we got it thanks Farah for the quick work guys play a little bit of Kim Kardashian mckennon there's a sense there's a sense as fans the business that's that's our Kardashian minister and that is spot on where Justin Trudeau is in terms of intellectual heft I think that vocal fry' actually helped Catherine McKenna get the job how we doing for time is 12 17 oh my gosh were almost rob was the third on the show and we haven't even started really I just for those who are joining in what we do every weekday from 12:00 noon til 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time is we kibbutz it's called super chat you can make comments along the side if you want me to read yours for sure you can ship in a couple bucks and puts it in highlight and we get the dough which helps us out here I showed you some crazy quick crazy news stories about criminals and catastrophic the ill people just walking into Canada and jumping the queue because of Justin Trudeau's ugly borders I have two more stories for you as well but I seen a a comments it's not a super chat comments just a regular comment says d-did views really apologize to Sheila he claims he did on his Twitter account well I should tell you and that's from real men fish that is not Deon views real Twitter account on Twitter of course there are impersonations and parody accounts all over the place as you surely know that was originally why the blue checkmark was brought in to distinguished genuine accounts from fake accounts as far as I know Dion views that is not his real account I know for a fact at least in my conversations with Sheila as recently as yesterday that to date Dion views has not submitted as it's not apologize does not in any way taken responsibility um I don't know if you saw our video clip at Dion busicom and I encourage you to check it out you can see the whole court ruling there you can see the original video tape of his punching of Sheila and I also show in my video briefly a letter of offer that Sheila's lawyer sent to Dion views saying if you just admit what you did and we have the tape idiots just admit what's on tape say sorry and then take a thousand bucks and give it to a women's shelter a charity give a thousand dollars to charity by the way you get a tax credit for it then we're done then the lawsuits over Dion views refused to do that he literally refused to acknowledge what he did he literally refused to pay a thousand dollars to a women's shelter instead he fought the whole trial was dragged down and he lost of course he lost us all in the video that's Giambi's he's the opposite of apologetic here's a comment from Jimin track in super Chad Jim thanks for chipping in for ninety nine she says I think Trudeau and his ilk are bent on destroying the middle class the poor and the country at large he is rich taxes and fees don't bother him there's a deeper truth theorem the Jim I think if you were to ask Justin Trudeau if that's his motivation he would say no of course not and and I think you'd have to be an awfully evil person to actually want to hurt the middle class of the poor and and I don't think Trudeau is deeply evil rather I think he's oblivious to real life remember he's a trust-fund kid son of a trust fund it grants his the last Trudeau who worked for a living was Justin Trudeau's grandfather who passed away long before Justin Trudeau was was even born so Justin Trudeau grew up under Pierre Trudeau who lived an exotic and bizarre and louche lifestyle Trudeau doesn't know any differently there's nothing in his life he's ever had to work for other than as a dilettante that's why he was a substitute teacher that's why he started taking some environmental degree and quit when it got boring that's why he loved the little odd jobs did you know that according to Trudeau boasting in some Iranian newspaper he has visited 90 countries as sort of like a backpacker frat boy dancing and drinking his way around the world I mean that's the lifestyle he's had and whenever there was a bill daddy's lawyers and accountants just took care of it I mean the very first time I met Justin Trudeau believe it or not I was having lunch with Andrew Coyne this is 15 years ago at a very fancy pants restaurant in Yorkville in Toronto called Sassafrass and there was Justin Trudeau who is related to coin by marriage and it was you know I wish I had sort of captured that moment in some way because it was Trudeau sort of in full date mode full trust fund throw money around hold court I felt like I there was this little moment of you know this air there was inherited wealth this aristocrat wealth without responsibility entitlement without responsibility it's tough to be the son of a famous and wealthy man I just have to live up to the name Trudeau didn't even try is what I'm saying Trudeau didn't even try and to watch him and watch him interact with Andrew Coyne who introduced us and just to see him there he was a Playboy until he was 40 and then he said oh I guess I better have a job and everyone around me says I'm their ticket to power so I guess I'm gonna okay I guess my first drop should be MP and then Prime Minister that's what he's like and my long point here is um I don't think Justin Trudeau is actually malicious towards regular people let alone poor people I think he just has no clue what it's like so for example when he would go and give a speech to a charity and he gave a speech to a lot of charities including his mother's favorite charity a mental health care journey he would charge some 20,000 or 30,000 dollars not because he needed the money he's a Multi multi multimillionaire his car alone is worth more than a million dollars um it's just that well of course because money comes to Justin Trudeau Justin Trudeau doesn't send money help money comes to him affection comes to him deference comes to him attention comes to him and if there's a fail well what a daddy slaughters takes care of it so he just is so detached from how real life is someone's always picked up the tab for him either someone in you know the public some public trough some tax payer or just someone who was paid to walk behind Justin Trudeau and clean up all his messes to pay all his bills and dance so I so for example of course when he became prime minister he canceled child tax credits for you know regular people but of course of course of course of course he hired not one but two nannies like he's Angelina Jolie or something on the public time and and that of course that's how it is because he's Trudeau and that's how I was of course he went to billionaires island with the AG economy duh that's what rich people are for what how can they serve Justin Trudeau and my long points here is that he's a mooch but I don't even think he knows he's a mooch because everyone around him has been happy to indulge that mooch enos just so they get to bask in his true donors that's my psychological theory about Justin Trudeau let's look at some more chit chat oh I think I missed the super chata what's going on for so long a pepper 5 to 435 said Ezra how many subscribers does the rebel have well there's two different ways of there's a few different ways of measuring one is on YouTube and as you can see in that little orange rectangle we have nine hundred and seven thousand YouTube subscribers um and that's why I'm slightly confused by the fact that we generally don't get more than five hundred people watching this super channel I'm wondering said the time of day is that the notifications we're doing wrong is Google throttling us that's absolutely possible I know they've demonetized us is it me I mean too boring is it the time zones of our people or did they sign up for other talent on the rebel I don't know but I would like to grow that now in fairness to what we're doing here we've only been doing this super chat thing this is our second week we have a really promoter that we sent one email out if I look at the kind of traffic that for example ben shapiro gets and he's such a big name in the united states he gets about two or three thousand following him on his live chats on youtube so you know four four or five hundred and our height i don't feel bad given it's our second week i believe that on the internet and sometimes people that say ask me for advice ezra how do I break through as a video personality my number one piece of advice is do it every day every single day so you get the discipline and the practice of it and so people can sort of count on the fact that the yeah there's gonna be some new video content from you it's like 7-eleven we just go to a 7-eleven or a max store because we know they're open all the time you don't have to sort of guess is it open you know then and that's my theory about successful people on the internet is if they have something every day then you're probably gonna be more likely to go there and of course you'll get better from practice um someone with a very long unpronounceable name says we don't get notifications well that's something maybe you should look into or we should look into are you clicking the bell are you clicking the notifications I'm not sure if we're doing it right because we do about I don't know 10 or 15 videos a day maybe you were you know maybe it's too many notifications maybe people think there's too many notifications if we're doing 10 videos a day do you want 10 notifications from us I don't know that's something to look into Eva CX oh I 2.0 says mr. Levin I signed up for notification but I am NOT getting YouTube alerts for your live show if that helps okay you're the second person who just said that so thank you for that tip we should look into it yeah cuz I think of nine hundred and seven thousand people got a notification that we were having a chat I think we'd get more than 200 people showing up I would like to think even if there's haters that's half the fun I think it's more fun reading hate me other than family don't you think uh Frank jalapeno says you're relevant not popular okay it could be true mr. Dallas 4/20 says Ezra just stream snipe ice Poseidon you'll have tons of viewers after that I gotta tell you I don't know what that is that's how old I am I don't know what's my body's Poseidon is if I weren't on live right now I would Google that so I would see much savvy er than I do oh there's a new super chat any chance rebel could check with chat with Bill Whittle that's from v6 I love Bill Whittle and I've and I've chatted not with I've actually met him like once or twice I don't even know if he would remember I think he is so smart I don't know if he would come on as a guest but I would I let me take that under advisement I'd like to have him you know can I tell you my favorite bill Whittle video average you know what I'm talking about um I think he's based in LA let me just check what timings before I go on too long he's tall Tony we have to have but let me make this story shorter than when I bumped into Justin's through though that one day I've met him I met Trudeau since then I ran my fingers through his hair but that's another story we'll talk about that later and he was awake by the way bill Whittle he has a video you gotta find it in fact can you find it Hannah while I'm chatting I think he call us at the three day channel the channel challenge or the 72 hour challenge or something he says I mean I think it's just a thought experiment I don't think he actually wants it to happen but he said imagine if everyone were sent out into the wilderness for three days like 1% of your year just on your own no benefits of high tech no electricity no no power tools no car just for 1% of your year just to remember how amazing and valuable civilization is and all these anti industry anti-capitalist anti-violent anti gas crazy leftist would first of all get a reminder of how amazing capitalist industry is how safe how clean how comfortable it is people sometimes think that the natural state of nature is somehow preferable to nature that is developed by people it's a five and a half minute video of course we're not gonna show all of it but Hannah can you just go forward so - when he announces his thesis I would just like to show people Bill Whittle in his own words so not only so we'll see that video of folks in one second but not only would it remind people of how important industrial society is but it would also I think be a refreshing reminder to individual people and I put myself in this category of how our parents and more likely our grandparents aren't that great-grandparents they actually knew how to do stuff they actually knew how to fix stuff maybe they could make a fire without matches you know Boy Scout stuff tie a rope make a lean-to I guess what I'm saying is Bill whittles idea and I don't think he would actually like to command everyone to leave the city for three days but it was a great thought experiment to make people connect to reality and remind them that what we have and our lifestyle is not an accident and it's not normal it's actually the result of generations of people working and challenging and struggling to give their descendants a better life we should not take it for granted and we should not regard it as normal and then let me know when you've got a clip and it doesn't have to be a kiki clip I just want to show people who Bill Whittle is if they don't know and just give them a minute of that talk well we're while we're lining that up let me read a little bit more Tegan bee says is there a way to only get notifications from certain rebel content creators like Sheila there are too many notifications for the videos I don't care about like Hollywood gossip and movie reviews you know what let me think about that some more because I am I can see where you're coming from we have a diversity of contributors we've got I don't know I haven't counted but maybe we got ten people contributing and if you don't want to hear from everybody let me think about that because I would like it if it was easier for people to get just what they want maybe more people would sign up anyways I was rambling on about Bill Whittle and our team here has found the clip you give us we don't play the whole thing but maybe give us 30 or 60 seconds of that bill Whittle clip just to show people or talk about and during those three and a half days I would force everyone to live out in the woods in a cabin I wouldn't make anyone chop wood if you want to shiver through three nights that's your business I'd make people carry their own water up from the river hey if you don't want to go to the trouble to boil it be my guest recovering from amoebic dysentery will be part of your education I think everybody grow and harvest their own food or dig up roots or collect berries or not it can sit and complain about it and not eat for three and a half days if you'd prefer and like most modern Americans I have a soft spot for little furry animals but I would make people trap and kill and skin them in order to stay alive that goes for chickens and fish as well you see in reality it can be ugly and bloody and horrible and that's something that those protesters have been protected from their entire lives but not anymore playtime is over now now I think that after three and a half days they spent working hard gathering food chopping wood and carrying water night times spent with no iPad no smartphone no Wi-Fi no DVDs or Xboxes I think that would be just enough to make people like this apprec the fact that there are people out there who will do these things for you I think three and a half days out there every year for 50 years would make you very grateful that there are groups of people willing to pump and purify your water provide endless and affordable electrical power so you can be 72° all the time that there are people who will kill clean cook package and deliver food so that you don't have to see the blood or the dirt all of those things and that these groups of people who provide these services are called corporations who feed their own selves and their own families by doing these ugly difficult unpleasant things for you and charging more than it costs isn't that the truth a it's the a great communicator I like the sound of his voice I like his look he's he's a great presenter that video is a few years old but I have watched it several times um and I think it's a thought experiment I really don't think bill really would put everyone out in a cabin for three days but you know people used to voluntarily go out into cabins Boy Scouts I mean I was in the Boy Scouts it was you know it was learning things it was learning skills learning how to tie knots learning how to try and light I mean it was a very uncomfortable kind of fun though sometimes the the fondest memories are being uncomfortable doing something and with other people together but it is a reminder that the life of urban luxury we live is not the normal state of affairs I haven't been to an ant oil protest in in a while and I'm not including my knocking on a David Suzuki David that was too much fun but I go to whatever last time I was at an NGO protest was Queen's Park in Toronto and I would go up to the protesters and I would just go from head to toe from their sunglasses to their backpacks to their iPhones and their cameras and I would just ask them about all the different things they were wearing and holding that could only be made from plastic which comes from petrochemicals nylon lasting so many things any kind of metal and and I say and I use this analogy a lot and I invite you to use this analogy I find it effective or at least it's a bit of a revelation and I always remind myself for their occasion I encounter vegetarians in my life and I'd like to think of myself as a tolerant person I don't like to be you know I like your people to benefit of the doubt if I were very tolerant workplace we have a vegetarian here and no one's mean to her my point is if someone's a vegetarian if there's a if they're a PETA activist which is even deeper and they're trying to convince you to be vegetarian trying to convince you not to wear leather fur alright I have never seen a PETA activist who while they're telling me not to eat meat or wear fur leather is chomping on a drumstick right chomping on a hamburger no because they're living in fact that's sort of the joke about vegans how do you know if someone's vegan oh they'll tell you and that's the thing is there's a consistency there they may be wrong but they're living it right they're walking the talk and let me put the shoe on the other foot now and this leads us to one of our stories today when was the last time you saw an anti oil anti industrial anti-fracking activists living it while doing it when was the last time you saw a protester with only natural fibers not using an Apple iPhone to tweet something from a McDonald's Wi-Fi and what a good segue to talk about another subject let me check the clock it's at 12:36 Al Gore Al Gore I saw his Inconvenient Truth when it came out half of its him in business class in a jet flying around while working on his Mac that's the anti-oil activist can we put up Al Gore's tweet this was just yesterday Al Gore who has several homes jets around he's actually on the board of Apple talk about a huge industrial company and this is what he wrote the Kinder Morgan pipeline is a pipeline in British Columbia for our American viewers he said the Kinder Morgan pipeline carrying dirty tar sands oil would be a step backward in our efforts to solve the climate crisis I stand with a Horgan that's the premier BC Mayor Gregor that's a mayor Vancouver and all of the Canadians including the first nations who are fighting to stop this destructive pipeline stop Kinder Morgan just hold that up there for a bit dirty tar sands well um there's no dirt in the oil there's oil in the oil like it's oh it's oily but it's not dirt and and it's not tar tar is chemically different so you've got an ignoramus here but he's using all the bait words dirty tar there is no turning it there is no tar in it it's bituminous oil it's heavy oil similar to the heavy oil that is the heaviest oil in the world in terms of viscosity and density but you know oil has different names you can take the tweet down now it's different you've heard of West Texas Intermediate North Sea Brent those are different kinds of oil and the intermediate it refers to how heavy it is you know the heaviest oil is in the world in terms of viscosity and density and Carboniferous this it's called California heavy it's from California where Apple is located where one of Al Gore's many homes is so Al Gore one of us he has a home in Tennessee is a home in California's a lot of homes he's always jetting around but let's just talk about California home the heaviest oil in the world comes from California California does not produce enough oil for his own needs so it imports its oil half of its oils you know where it imports are from from Saudi Arabia obviously look at the map American imports oil from Saudi Arabia for California's use can you remember the last time Al Gore criticized Saudi Arabia Iran Iraq Venezuela Nigeria United Arab Emirates Kuwait I'm just listing OPEC countries every single OPEC country is either a full-out dictatorship or an authoritarian regime Nigeria's sort of democracy ish that's the closest you're gonna get to a democracy and OPEC I think it was the last time that Al Gore criticized a pipeline in a conflict oil country see the thing is the daily global demand for oil is about a hundred million barrels every single day and the oil sands maybe makes about two and a bit million so about two percent of the world's all come from the oil says 98 percent comes from elsewhere ten million barrels a day from Saudi Arabia 10 million barrels a day from Russia when was the last time Al Gore took a rail took a run in Saudi oil to run an OPEC well it took a run in Russia I can't recall it I don't recall it why does he only go after ethical oil from Canada instead of conflict oil from OPEC well I know the answer I know the answer and I think you do too maybe you know this Al Gore used to have a failing TV nation and a TV station and when I say failing I'm not just being Trumpy and giving him a mean nickname it was a disaster in terms of rating I think it's called Current TV or something and he sold it to Al Jazeera which is the state broadcaster of Qatar which is not only an oil-rich OPEC dictatorship it's one of the sponsors Qatar as you know is one of the sponsors of Isis another awful terrorist they paid more than a hundred million dollars for this money-losing nobody watches a Current TV and Al Gore personally made 70 million US dollars it's almost 100 million Canadian from Qatar because that was the cable package so basically when Al Jazeera came to America they didn't need Al Gore's crummy studios you can build a studio for a few million bucks that's nothing to an Arab oil tycoon what they wanted was his cable deals in this distribution so they were sneaking into American homes al Jazeera wanted to get the propaganda into American homes al Jazeera I mean that's sort of like Russia today is for Putin al Jazeera is for the royal family of Qatar Al Gore this anti oil activist who did an inconvenient truth enriched himself by at least 70 million dollars of oil money by the way he turned down an inquiry from Glenn Beck who wanted to buy it because Al Gore literally prefers tyrannical authoritarian dictatorships in the Middle East to a mere conservative in America who's a liberal you know liberal in terms of beliefs and freedoms Al Gore chose a foreign dictatorship over a four fellow American so it's a bit of hooks but it's been a hoods but Al Gore telling us not to have our dirty oil it's not dirty it's not there's no tar in it it's less heavy than California oil and it's more ethical and moral than Saudi oil that he prefers like I say it would be like a PETA activist chomping on a big drumstick saying no Joey don't you wear a leather it's bad for animals while he's eating a big drumstick hey it's 12:42 and I've been talking on stop I want to tell you about an event we got coming up on June 2nd for those in Ontario oh and we've got some more announcement some more talent I'm gonna save those announcements to Monday but let me show you an ad here's and it has some highlights from last year's event including our friend Jordan Peterson take a look we're gonna discuss topics that the political elites in the media party don't want us to discuss political correctness be damned not principally diaper world by perhaps be our in better touch with the pulse of the country we are in this fight with you and you're all in this fight together in over the last few years has been this populist movement going around the world that's the status of the left at this point is I don't know if you're the onion or the New York time most modernism is a sophisticated philosophically wrong but it's deeply wrong we're simply people with another point of view hey welcome back that's just a little sneak peek at rebel live.com it's coming up on June 2nd while that ad was running I was skimming some more comments John Zeeland says rebels should start putting some videos on other platforms I agree we do put some of them up on Facebook and we do embed some on Twitter natively twitter has some limits on it but one of the things we were talking about doing is this live broadcast streaming it in three platforms simultaneously if we can do that I think we can on YouTube on Facebook and even on periscope which is affiliated with Twitter so I think that's one way we're going to tweak this I'm still thinking about the time of day I'm not sure if that's the best I don't know what time would be better let me ask our production team if they can scare up the raw video of deon views at the Women's March in 2017 and we were chatting a little bit about Giambi's and some people might have thought well who's that what Sam it's we had some good news this week we sued a male feminist alt left fuck it's a lot of adjectives but each one of them is true his name was Dion views and he's got a lip ring it when you have a lip ring on a fella I think you know pretty much 90% about what you need to know just from the lip ring would you agree with me would you agree with me so this fellow with a lip ring was that the women's March day he's a guy at a women's March but that's how male feminists work Jian Ghomeshi was a Women's Studies major obviously for access to women and as sort of a preemptive strike against anyone who said you're a crazy sexist wife beater or your girlfriend beater same thing with Eric's tournament the disgraced Attorney General from New York who just resigned for beating the women he was he was such a feminist in public so that he could attract women and if he when he punched his girlfriend's you'd say I'm a feminist Joyce Reeves donated 20 bucks in the super chat thank you for that same with Harvey Weinstein who I think has been credibly accused of actual rape super feminists would attend all the feminist events said he was and any of this Dion B use male feminist goes to the women's March in Edmonton and encounters our Alberta bureau chief Sheila GaN Reed who is talking to people about the women's March and just asking questions and Dion views identifies that she's with the rebel and doesn't like that and let me show you about a minute and a half of footage that follow this is raw footage this is what happened that the women's March you got a woman's price you see all those pink pussy hats they're there for women's rights a they literally observe a man punch a woman and what do they do did they assist today in any way comfort or assist Sheila knowed they comforted they patted Dion views did you see that they comforted and consult him whisked him away and blocked Sheila from accessing him Ezra's first two regulars chips in two pounds keep up the good work after Chad opened all thank you no not a word or a squawk or not no assistance for Sheila no condemnation for that thug they helped him scurry away no one called security she went shield went against security herself this was that as a women's March a man punched a woman at a women's March but because he was a male feminist and she was conservative they helped him get away now that guy is so stupid know about with the camera rolling as you may know we put that video online and find the thug calm we offered a thousand dollar reward within minutes people turned him in because he's not well-liked even by his friends it was his friends who turned to me and I should tell you many of them many of them we we had a lot of people so that's Deon views Giambi's was found and was charged with a crime and he was convicted but through a procedural hiccup that should not have happened Sheila was not advised of the court date so Sheila was not there to give evidence the video you just saw was not presented to the judge Sheila did not have a chance to make a victim impact statement and so that little thug there got off without any jail time and he just had to do 30 hours of community service for punching a woman in the face at the woman's munch so we sued him in civil court so the criminal court we didn't get enough justice so we sued him in civil court for assault and battery and the trial was held about a month ago to the trial and the judge found for Sheila now he's getting punched in the face you're not gonna get a million dollars for that but Sheila got a few thousand dollars in damages and what's called punitive damages because his conduct was in the words of the judge reprehensible and the judge took specific pains to say that this was an attack on journalism and free speech and Sheila's right to cover was a very good ruling and the judge also specifically mentioned that justice was not done in the Criminal Court because Sheila wasn't there in the video wasn't seen now Dion views has not yet paid his damages to Sheila and I don't know if that if he will he's still in resistance mode like I say we offered to 2d on views if he simply apologized and made a donation to a women's shelter we would have dropped the the Sheila would have dropped the suit but he's certainly in resistance he thinks fighting against Sheila and punishing girls is his way of fighting against Donald Trump or something I don't know but if you want to read the court case I encourage you to go to Dion boos commie damn rights I bought the URL for his name and for the rest of his life or at least until he apologizes and said things says things right for the rest of his life his name Dion beers di onp EWS calm will have the story of his crime punching Sheila you can read the full court judgment there and if you want to help us pay for our lawyers cuz you know what it costs us thirty six grands assume we had an excellent lawyer and his fees were reasonable but I'm afraid that's how much it costs to to file a statement of claim and go to the pre-trial hearings and run a two day trial and we still have to collect from him so if you want to help out Sheila please go to Sheila how about a thrilling with our legal fees but Sheila we were delighted to help her it was an act of loyalty I think to defend her against the side wouldn't you and don't you think it we had to sue him don't you think can you imagine letting that go can you imagine just letting some guy punch a woman at a woman's watch because she was conservative unthinkable and what's so gross about this I think it's the grossest part not a word from any feminist organization in the country not one word I just saw true the organizer the women's March had a word she denied it even happen she said it it was all made up not a word from any journalistic organization Canadian journalists for free expression Canadian Association of journalists Canadian Civil Liberties Association not a word do you think that if a left-wing reporter a woman were punched in the face by some alt-right violent thug do you think that would be ignored or do you think rather that would be the top of the news forever and a national teachable moment and you think the victim of that punch would be given some free speech prize and be made some honorary professor of journalism and some school do you doubt that if it had been a left-wing journalist punched by a right-wing thug that everyone in Canada would know the name of the and the victim but because the shoes on the other foot because it was Sheila a conservative with the rebel who was punched and it was that little fug Dion view's who did the punching in the name of social justice or whatever the name of feminists I don't know what not a peep well you know what justice is required whether or not the fancy people wanted and I feel like we got some justice again I encourage you to go to Dion views calm to read the ruling it is 12:53 you know Ellen take a short break because I we have another ad and we're eminently our first documentary is gonna be for sale in DVD and video on demand I don't know if it's for sale immediately as in today it might be next week but let me show an ad of what I'm talking about take a look even though your little motion planet Galilee moon hey welcome back I was just leaving through the comments I'm not sure if I mentioned Joyce Reeves was kind enough to chip in 20 bucks through supergiant I appreciate that um you know what we say Friday's is sort of open forum Fridays so let me just read a few more here Mac WM says Canada has been sliding left for decades it's more than dispiriting you're right I think the Harper years sort of stopped the slide to the left but it didn't reverse much did it it just sort of gave us a pause Tammy patents as an Bell says Kinsey research responsible for depraved sex ed curriculum being pushed by UN well in the case of Ontario it was by Ben Levin who was the Deputy Minister of Education who oversaw the process of the new sex ed curriculum and shockingly he was prosecuted and convicted for child pornography and trying to lure young children to meet with him to be molested just shocking shocking andrea Hetherington said Dion views can't pay his fines because he spends all the time virtue signaling and punching conservatives well we'll see if he pays and I think he's I mean I'm stubborn I actually admire stubbornness as a as a personality trait in many cases I think I think more of us should be stubborn and few of us should be compliant or at least we shouldn't always be complaining but how can you be stubborn in the face of that videotape a criminal conviction and now a civil court conviction how can you be so stubborn Sheila offered him if he just admitted what he did said sorry and gave a thousand bunch to a women's shelter he could go how can you be so stubborn to turn that down and say now I want a two-day trial I'm fighting this thing fighting this thing we saw you on tape punch her after threatening to punch her at a women's March you know what I don't know if he's gonna paint the I think it's 3500 4500 that he owes I imagine that if he resisted well I mean there's a way to enforce a judgment in the lie can collect I mean he's a luthier which means he makes handmade guitars I guess Sheela will own his guitar company if he doesn't pay cash I don't know why maybe it's good for you know a fireplace I'm guessing that word burns very nicely um its 1257 hunky monkey says it went viral to catch the kisser I don't know what you're talking about there Gavin Giants has put him the NIC and see how long he lasts I think you're talking about putting Dion views in prison I think you're right I don't think he would do well in there maybe they have it also a diet though cuz I don't think he's a meat-eater speaking of vegans um Daniel grant said Harper would have kept us safe I didn't agree with everything he did but he kept us safe there's some truth there there's some truth there although they were turret terrorist attacks on his watch I don't blame Stephen Harper for that I mean the terrorists attacked by an isis-inspired terrorists on Parliament Hill that killed constable sorry corporal Nathan Cirillo that was when Stephen Harper was prime minister but you're right he didn't open up the borders and bring in tens of thousands of unvetted Muslim migrants from Syria um true Brit says the globalists are days away from starting World War three the Middle East so why do we still talk about trivial things all I'm seeing is the military taking control of the food and water draft or cannibalism don't quite understand all of that I agree with you that things are on the move I don't think we're on the brink of World War three in fact I think that probably you know that union of Sciences or something used to have the Doomsday Clock how many minutes to midnight and they would move that our handle is a minute hand depending on world tensions North Korea is having a sit-down with the whole Trump but next month in Singapore Iran deal is Iran's being marginalized I actually think the likelihood of World War three is lower now at any time over the last decade that's just my own views folks it's at 12:59 the hour goes by so quickly I thank you for joining us we'll be back on Monday we're gonna get keep trying it at this noon hour slot I would like your advice if there's a different time slot we're gonna try and add Facebook and Twitter too I just wanna just maybe there's a notifications thing I just think with nine hundred and seven thousand subscribers maybe those folks aren't being notified or maybe we send out too many notifications about too many videos I don't know we'll try and figure that out I mean I like doing it it's a nice way to spend an hour and obviously the folks who are here find it rewarding enough I would just like to get our viewership up tenfold maybe I'm you know maybe two weeks innocence early and is it's too early to make that judgement so I'll see you on Monday and if you're a subscriber to my show please tune in tonight at 8 p.m. Eastern where we will talk to two people on the ground in Israel about what's going on with Iran and the embassy move and I think you'll like my monologue tonight - it's about environmental extremists in Vancouver that's it for today have a
