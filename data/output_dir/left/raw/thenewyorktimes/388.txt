1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810


2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,700
He runs one of the most
enigmatic countries

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,196
on the planet, a nuclear-armed
police state all but sealed off

4
00:00:06,196 --> 00:00:07,320
from the rest of the world.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,300


6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,870
Kim Jong Un is only 33, but
since taking power after his

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,070
father Kim Jong Il died in 2011,
he's asserted himself using

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,550
missile tests, ruthless
purges of top advisers,

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,260
and a war of words
with the rest.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,250
Like other dictators before
him, he rules the country with

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,140
an iron fist.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,240
Dissent doesn't
exist in North Korea.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,060
And its citizens are fed a
steady stream of propaganda

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,450
designed to prop up Kim's
cult of personality.

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,600
Kim is often seen presiding
over vast military parades

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,190
or missile tests.

17
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,830
In one of the odder moments
on the international stage,

18
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,670
he appears palling around with
former NBA player Dennis Rodman

19
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,110
in Pyongyang.

20
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,550
The athlete even serenaded
the leader for his birthday.

21
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,883
(SINGING) Happy birthday to you.

22
00:00:56,883 --> 00:01:00,880
Happy birthday dear [INAUDIBLE].

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,230
Gauging Kim's
intentions is difficult.

24
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,490
Many experts say he's a rational
leader whose sole purpose is

25
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,720
staying in power.

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,600
They think he uses his missile
arsenal and nuclear ambitions

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,900
to quell dissent internally, but
also to ward off any attempts

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,540
by other nations to try and
topple him or call for his

29
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,160
ouster.

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,220
In a public address, broadcast
live inside North Korea

31
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,060
in 2012, he pledged to continue
his father's military-first

32
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,150
strategy, demonstrating
his commitment to expanding

33
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,410
the country's nuclear program.

34
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:48,020


35
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,220
Observers have long pointed
out that Kim Jong Un's rotund

36
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,770
appearance and wide smile signal
his attempts to channel his

37
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,970
grandfather, Kim Il Sung,
the country's founder.

38
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,430
The international community
has tried to put the squeeze

39
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,260
on North Korea's
nuclear program,

40
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,240
using everything from
sanctions to threats.

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,820


42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,257
But like his grandfather
and father before him,

43
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:15,590
Kim Jong Un tends to meet
pressure with pressure when it

44
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,610
comes to rhetoric or weapons.

45
00:02:18,610 --> 00:00:00,000
