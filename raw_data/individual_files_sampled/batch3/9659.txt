Jon: CATHERINE HERRIDGE IS IN WASHINGTON WITH MORE DETAILS. THANK YOU, JON. GOOD MORNING. RUDY GIULIANI CONFIRMING TO FOX NEWS THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL TOLD THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ABOUT SECRETLY RECORDING THE PRESIDENT AFTER FIRING JAMES COMEY LAST YEAR WAS SARCASTIC. HE ALSO SAID THE PRESIDENT DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL INVOKING THE 25TH AMENDMENT TO REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE. RUDY GIULIANI NOTED THAT JEFF SESSIONS MONDAY THIS WEEK, ROSENSTEIN WENT THERE IN HE PHONED INTO "FOX AND FRIENDS" AND QUESTION WHY HE DID NOT GO TO THE HEALTH TO TELL HIS SIDE OF THE STORY. I WAS SURPRISED AT THAT. I WOULD THINK THAT HE WOULD. HE MENTIONED CERTAIN THINGS TO ME THAT ARE VERY POSITIVE ABOUT THAT EVENT, AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT HE WOULD WANT TO PUT THAT ON. FRANKLY, WHETHER YOU ARE UNDER OATH OR NOT, BUT HE SAID SOME THINGS TO ME THAT I WOULD THINK WOULD BE FUN FOR HIM TO TESTIFY. SO I AM A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT HE WOULDN'T DO IT. HE WORKED UNDER DIRECTOR COMEY, HE BELIEVES THAT HE SAID HE THOUGHT THAT THE COMMENTS WERE SERIOUS. ANOTHER WITNESS THAT IS AT ODDS WITH THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ACCOUNT. THE SESSION TODAY, THERE WAS REALLY AN IMPACT, SOME LAWMAKERS PUSHING FOR A TRANSCRIBED INTERVIEW UNDER OATH BECAUSE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ROSENSTEIN ARE SO SERIOUS. A BRIEFING OR MORE INFORMAL
