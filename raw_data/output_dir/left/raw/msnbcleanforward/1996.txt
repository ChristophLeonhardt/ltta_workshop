ON THIS. REPUBLICANS SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN

12
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,778
REPUBLICANS SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN THE SIGNAL THAT IF THE MEDIA IS

13
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:22,612
THE SIGNAL THAT IF THE MEDIA IS ATTACKING DONALD TRUMP, DIG IN

00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,147
ATTACKING DONALD TRUMP, DIG IN THEIR HEELS, DON’T WORRY, THE

THEIR HEELS, DON’T WORRY, THE POLL NUMBERS WILL GO UP.

16
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,649
POLL NUMBERS WILL GO UP. THE SAME THING HAPPENED DURING

17
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,217
THE SAME THING HAPPENED DURING THE ELECTION.

18
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,486
THE ELECTION. WHENEVER THE REPORTERS OR THE

19
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,489
WHENEVER THE REPORTERS OR THE MEDIA WAS CRITICIZING DONALD

20
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:33,323
MEDIA WAS CRITICIZING DONALD TRUMP FOR SOMETHING THAT HE DID

21
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,025
TRUMP FOR SOMETHING THAT HE DID WAS INAPPROPRIATE AT THE TIME,

22
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,994
WAS INAPPROPRIATE AT THE TIME, GOING AFTER A GOLD STAR FAMILY,

23
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,196
GOING AFTER A GOLD STAR FAMILY, WHATEVER, JUDGE CURIEL, IT FELT

24
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,597
WHATEVER, JUDGE CURIEL, IT FELT LIKE DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS

25
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,032
LIKE DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS WOULD DIG IN THEIR HEELS AND HIS

26
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,433
WOULD DIG IN THEIR HEELS AND HIS POLL NUMBERS WOULD GO UP.

27
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:43,967
POLL NUMBERS WOULD GO UP. >> YEAH.

28
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,236
>> YEAH. THAT IS THE PATTERN.

29
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,308
THAT IS THE PATTERN. I MEAN YOU HAVE TRIBALISM,

30
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,942
I MEAN YOU HAVE TRIBALISM, TRANSACTIONISM,

31
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:52,810
TRANSACTIONISM, ANTI-ANTI-TRUMPISM, ALL OF THOSE

32
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:53,544
ANTI-ANTI-TRUMPISM, ALL OF THOSE THINGS PLAYING IN.

33
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,846
THINGS PLAYING IN. THE HARDER HE GETS PUSHED, THE

34
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,347
THE HARDER HE GETS PUSHED, THE MORE HIS SUPPORTERS DECIDE THEY

35
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:59,549
MORE HIS SUPPORTERS DECIDE THEY HAVE TO STAND BY THEIR MAN.

36
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,051
HAVE TO STAND BY THEIR MAN. AND AGAIN, IT IS INTERESTING.

37
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,619
AND AGAIN, IT IS INTERESTING. I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THE

38
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:03,854
I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS A LITTLE BIT MORE

39
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,856
NUMBERS A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSELY, THOUGH, BECAUSE HIS

40
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,858
CLOSELY, THOUGH, BECAUSE HIS SUPPORT AMONG SELF-DESCRIBED

41
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,693
SUPPORT AMONG SELF-DESCRIBED INDEPENDENTS, YOU KNOW, IS VERY,

42
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:10,461
INDEPENDENTS, YOU KNOW, IS VERY, VERY SOFT.

43
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,330
VERY SOFT. SO YOU KIND OF WONDER WHETHER OR

44
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:14,431
SO YOU KIND OF WONDER WHETHER OR NOT THESE NUMBERS ARE PERHAPS

45
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:15,832
NOT THESE NUMBERS ARE PERHAPS SLIGHTLY SKEWED BY THE NUMBER OF

46
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:17,768
SLIGHTLY SKEWED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO GO, OKAY, IF THIS IS

47
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,336
PEOPLE WHO GO, OKAY, IF THIS IS WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STANDS

48
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,938
WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STANDS FOR, THEN I’M OUT AND,

49
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,039
FOR, THEN I’M OUT AND, THEREFORE, THEY DON’T

50
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:22,473
THEREFORE, THEY DON’T SELF-IDENTIFY.

51
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,674
SELF-IDENTIFY. BUT THERE’S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT

52
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:24,808
BUT THERE’S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT THAT THE BASE IS STICKING WITH

53
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,844
THAT THE BASE IS STICKING WITH HIM AND THAT OBVIOUSLY EXPLAINS

54
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,979
HIM AND THAT OBVIOUSLY EXPLAINS WHY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE ALSO

55
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:33,016
WHY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE ALSO STICKING WITH HIM AND RELUCTANT

56
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,684
STICKING WITH HIM AND RELUCTANT TO TAKE ANY STRONG ACTION.

57
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,386
TO TAKE ANY STRONG ACTION. >> IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO

58
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,687
>> IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPLAY THIS SOUND BITE FROM THE

59
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,689
REPLAY THIS SOUND BITE FROM THE CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS NOW

60
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:39,857
CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS NOW OFFICIALLY TWO AND A HALF YEARS

61
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,859
OFFICIALLY TWO AND A HALF YEARS OLD TODAY.

62
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:42,960
OLD TODAY. LISTEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.

63
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,196
LISTEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. >> MY PEOPLE ARE SO SMART.

64
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,297
>> MY PEOPLE ARE SO SMART. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY SAY

65
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:47,865
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY SAY ABOUT MY PEOPLE, THE POLLS?

66
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,500
ABOUT MY PEOPLE, THE POLLS? THEY SAY I HAVE THE MOST LOYAL

67
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,067
THEY SAY I HAVE THE MOST LOYAL PEOPLE.

68
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,202
PEOPLE. DID YOU EVER SEE THAT?

69
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:53,571
DID YOU EVER SEE THAT? I COULD STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF

70
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,306
I COULD STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF FIFTH AVENUE AND SHOOT SOMEBODY

71
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,774
FIFTH AVENUE AND SHOOT SOMEBODY AND I WOULDN’T LOSE ANY VOTERS.

72
00:01:56,817 --> 00:02:00,411
AND I WOULDN’T LOSE ANY VOTERS. IT’S LIKE INCREDIBLE.

73
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:05,316
IT’S LIKE INCREDIBLE. >> CHARLIE, DOES THAT STILL RING

74
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:05,616
>> CHARLIE, DOES THAT STILL RING TRUE?

75
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,451
TRUE? >> YES, OBVIOUSLY IT DOES.

76
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:08,819
>> YES, OBVIOUSLY IT DOES. WE’RE SEEING THIS PLAYED OUT ON

77
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,020
WE’RE SEEING THIS PLAYED OUT ON A WEEKLY BASIS.

78
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:11,489
A WEEKLY BASIS. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE HAD THIS

79
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:11,923
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION.

80
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:12,924
CONVERSATION. IS THIS THE STRAW?

81
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,993
IS THIS THE STRAW? WILL THIS BE THE TURNING POINT?

82
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:18,529
WILL THIS BE THE TURNING POINT? WILL THIS FINALLY BREAK THIS

83
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,831
WILL THIS FINALLY BREAK THIS LOCK-STEP REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR

84
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:21,700
LOCK-STEP REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP?

85
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,434
DONALD TRUMP? AND NOTHING DOES AT THIS POINT.

86
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:24,869
AND NOTHING DOES AT THIS POINT. SO THE EXTRAORDINARY THING IS

87
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,103
SO THE EXTRAORDINARY THING IS NOT THAT DONALD TRUMP TURNED OUT

88
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:27,839
NOT THAT DONALD TRUMP TURNED OUT TO BE WHO WE THOUGHT HE WAS, THE

89
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,241
TO BE WHO WE THOUGHT HE WAS, THE EXTRAORDINARY THING HAS BEEN THE

90
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,142
EXTRAORDINARY THING HAS BEEN THE DEGREE TO WHICH CONSERVATIVES

91
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,543
DEGREE TO WHICH CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS HAVE ADJUSTED

92
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:33,944
AND REPUBLICANS HAVE ADJUSTED AND ADAPTED THEMSELVES AND THEIR

93
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:36,080
AND ADAPTED THEMSELVES AND THEIR STANDARDS AND FRANKLY THEIR

94
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,048
STANDARDS AND FRANKLY THEIR MORALITY TO DONALD TRUMP.

95
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:40,351
MORALITY TO DONALD TRUMP. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE

96
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,619
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE SPECULATE, WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR

97
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,154
SPECULATE, WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR THEM TO BREAK WITH DONALD TRUMP,

98
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,355
THEM TO BREAK WITH DONALD TRUMP, IT’S PROBABLY ALREADY HAPPENED.

99
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:45,656
IT’S PROBABLY ALREADY HAPPENED. >> LOOK AT JEFF FLAKE.

100
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,259
>> LOOK AT JEFF FLAKE. HE COMES OUT AND CRITICIZES THE

101
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,893
HE COMES OUT AND CRITICIZES THE PRESIDENT.

102
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:50,128
PRESIDENT. CRITICIZES THE PRESIDENT FOR

103
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:51,129
CRITICIZES THE PRESIDENT FOR THAT MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN

104
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:52,363
THAT MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN THE OTHER DAY.

105
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:53,731
THE OTHER DAY. HE’S BEEN ONE OF THE MORE

106
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,166
HE’S BEEN ONE OF THE MORE OUTSPOKEN PEOPLE ALONG WITH JOHN

107
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,635
OUTSPOKEN PEOPLE ALONG WITH JOHN McCAIN AND OTHERS.

108
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,470
McCAIN AND OTHERS. WHEN YOU ASK JEFF FLAKE WHAT IS

109
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,939
WHEN YOU ASK JEFF FLAKE WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT, HOLD UP

110
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,775
HE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT, HOLD UP JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS, AS HE DID

111
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:06,478
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS, AS HE DID FOR TARIFFS, JEFF FLAKE SAYS NO.

112
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,514
FOR TARIFFS, JEFF FLAKE SAYS NO. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, NICK?

113
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:10,148
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, NICK? CHARLIE, GO AHEAD.

114
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,250
CHARLIE, GO AHEAD. >> I AM FASCINATED BY THESE

115
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,451
>> I AM FASCINATED BY THESE MANTRAS OF IMPOTENCE THAT WE GET

116
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:14,452
MANTRAS OF IMPOTENCE THAT WE GET FROM MEMBERS OF THE UNITED

117
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:15,186
FROM MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE.

118
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:18,756
STATES SENATE. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL

119
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:20,992
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AUGUST BODIES IN THE BORLDWORLD

120
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:21,392
AUGUST BODIES IN THE BORLDWORLD LEGISLATIVE.

121
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:22,794
LEGISLATIVE. THE CONSTITUTION ENDOWED

122
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,530
THE CONSTITUTION ENDOWED CONGRESS WITH INCREDIBLE POWER,

123
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:27,098
CONGRESS WITH INCREDIBLE POWER, WHETHER IT IS TO LEGISLATE, TO

124
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:28,733
WHETHER IT IS TO LEGISLATE, TO CONFIRM, TO CONSULT, TO HOLD

125
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:29,100
CONFIRM, TO CONSULT, TO HOLD HEARINGS.

126
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:30,435
HEARINGS. ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

127
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,304
ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AND YET YOU TALK TO MEMBERS OF

128
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:33,572
AND YET YOU TALK TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS RIGHT NOW AND IT’S

129
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:35,807
CONGRESS RIGHT NOW AND IT’S LIKE, WELL, WE CAN’T DO ANYTHING

130
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:36,308
LIKE, WELL, WE CAN’T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

131
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:37,676
ABOUT IT. WE ARE COMPLETELY POWERLESS.

132
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:38,577
WE ARE COMPLETELY POWERLESS. WHETHER OR NOT IT’S ABOUT

133
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:39,778
WHETHER OR NOT IT’S ABOUT POLITICAL COURAGE OR NOT, ISN’T

134
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:41,213
POLITICAL COURAGE OR NOT, ISN’T THIS EXACTLY WHY WE HAD A SYSTEM

135
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:43,615
THIS EXACTLY WHY WE HAD A SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES?

136
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,417
OF CHECKS AND BALANCES? ISN’T THIS EXACTLY WHAT JAMES

137
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,818
ISN’T THIS EXACTLY WHAT JAMES MADISON TALKED ABOUT IN THE

138
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:47,986
MADISON TALKED ABOUT IN THE FEDERALIST PAPERS?

139
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,521
FEDERALIST PAPERS? BEING A UNITED STATES SENATOR OR

140
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:50,989
BEING A UNITED STATES SENATOR OR CHAIRING A MAJOR COMMITTEE LIKE

141
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,024
CHAIRING A MAJOR COMMITTEE LIKE THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE

142
00:03:52,034 --> 00:00:00,000
THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND DECIDING, YEAH, YOU KNOW
