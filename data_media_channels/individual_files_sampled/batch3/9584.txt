JUNE 12TH WE WILL BE IN SINGAPORE. IT'LL BE A BEGINNING, I DON'T SAY AND I NEVER SAID IT HAPPENS IN ONE MEETING. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YEARS OF HOSTILE MY, YEARS OF PROBLEMS. THERE'S REALLY HATRED BETWEEN SO MANY DIFFERENT NATIONS BUT I THINK YOU'LL HAVE A VERY POSITIVE RESULT IN THE END. PAUL: THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP FRIDAY ANNOUNCING THAT THE JUNE 12TH SUMMIT WITH PRESIDENT KIM JONG UN IS BACK ON AFTER MEETINGS THIS WEEK WITH SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO AND A TOP NORTH KOREAN OFFICIAL. THOSE MEETINGS TAPPED OFF BY VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSE FRIDAY WHERE NORTH KOREAN DELEGATION DELIVERED A LETTER FROM KIM JONG UN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. EARLIER I SPOKE WITH REFIRED FOUR-STAR GENERAL JACK KEANE ABOUT THE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE JUNE 12TH MEETING. SO WE HAVE THE REPORT OF A LETTER FROM KIM JONG UN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, APPARENTLY SAYING I WANT TO HAVE THE MEETING, BUT NO DEMANDS AND NO CONCESSIONS, IS THAT ENOUGH TO GO AHEAD WITH A SUMMIT? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THAT THE LETTER IS IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LETTER TO KIM JONG UN AND HE ENDED HIS LETTER WHEN HE WAS TERMINATING THE SUMMIT, GET BACK TO ME IF YOU WANT TO GO FORWARD. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THIS IS. WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT MUCH MORE THAN THAT. WE HAVE TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT SECRETARY POMPEO IS SAYING. WHILE HE SAYS ON THE ONE HAND WE MAKE GREAT PROGRESS, ON THE OTHER HAND, SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND DIFFERENCES AND I THINK WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO AS IN HIS WORDS SET THE CONDITIONS. RESOLVE DIFFERENCES SO WE CAN SET UP AT LEAST THE FIRST SUMMIT BECAUSE LIKELY TO BE MORE THAN THAT WHERE THERE CAN BE SOME SUCCESS, WHERE THEY CAN AT LEAST AGREE ON A FRAMEWORK GOING FORWARD. THE PRESIDENT IS REALLY HOLDING ALL THE CARDS HERE, PAUL, I MEAN, HE DOESN'T NEED THE SUMMIT AS MUCH AS THE NORTH KOREANS NEED IT AND THIS PERIOD RIGHT NOW, WE ARE GETTING UP CLOSE TO THE SUMMIT, HE STILL HAS SIGNIFICAN LEVERAGE AND I'M SURE HE'S USING LEVERAGE TO THE FULLEST WITH POMPEO AND ALSO KIM SUNG OVER IN NORTH KOREA. PAUL: SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THERE'S JUST A MEET AND GREET SUMMIT, NO TANGIBLE MOVEMENT ON THE NORTH KOREAN SIDE TOWARDS DENUCLEARIZATION, THAT'S A VICTORY FOR KIM JONG UN BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE SAT ON THE STAGE WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND TURNED OUT TO BE KIND OF A MEET AND GREET, WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT? I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT. IF THAT'S ALL THERE IS, THEN THE PRESIDENT AT A MINIMUM SHOULD DELAY THE SUMMIT AND APPLY MORE PRESSURE TO TRY TO GET THESE DIFFERENCES TO CLOSE A LITTLE BIT AND IF HE CAN'T, HE'S JUST GOT TO BACK AWAY. HE CANNOT GO IN THERE AND JUST COME OUT WITH A FRAMEWORK FOR A PEACE TREATY ENDING THE WAR AND BRING BACK THE FAMILIES FROM THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AND REUNITE THEM AND AGREE IN GENERAL THAT THE SECURITY OF NORTH KOREA IS PARAMOUNT TO THE UNITED STATES, THAT WOULD BE UNSATISFACTORY SOLUTION. PAUL: OKAY, THERE'S A MERGING HERE ON DIFFERENCE ON PACE OF DENUCLEARIZATION, THE UNITED STATES SAYING IT MUST BE COMPLETE, VERIFIABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE AND THE NORTH KOREANS SUGGESTING THAT, WELL, WE WANT THIS TO BE IN A FAZED FORM, WE WANT TO YOU DO ONE THING AND WE WILL DO SOMETHING. IS THAT WHAT YOU SEE AS THE BIGGEST GAP THAT HAS TO CLOSE? IT CERTAINLY IS AND THEY WANT TO DO THIS OVER A PERIOD OF MANY YEARS, CERTAINLY THEY WANT OUTLAST TRUMP'S FIRST TERM BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW IF HE WILL HAVE A SECOND ONE, I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT ON THE MARK WHEN HE'S SAYING, I WANT TO GET THIS DONE DURING MY PRESIDENCY, DURING MY FIRST TERM, TWO PLUS YEARS IS SUFFICIENT TIME TO GET IT DONE. WE CAN FAZE IT DURING THOSE TWO YEARS, I'M NOT GOING TO PASS THIS PROBLEM ONTO SUCCESS OR AS IT'S BEEN PASSED ONTO ME AND I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE GOAL TO HAVE AND WE SHOULD STICK TO IT. PAUL: AS WE KNOW, WE HAVE DONE TWICE BEFORE, PROMISE OF DENUCLEARIZATION OVER STAGES AND BOTH TIMES THE NORTH KOREANS RENEGED, STOPPED, KICKED OUT INSPECTORS, SO, I MEAN, IT'S A BIT OF A GAMBLE WITH THE UNITED STATES, WITH ANY PRESIDENT TAKING THEIR WORD FOR IT AGAIN. I TOTALLY AGREE. RUSSIANS AND CHINESE ARE BOTH ADVISING KIM JONG UN TO TO THE FAZED OPERATION AND PUSH IT OUT OVER MANY YEARS FOR THE VERY REASON THAT THE NORTH KOREANS ARE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF US IN THE PAST. IT'S A PROMISE THAT IS NOT KEPT AND THAT'S CLEARLY THE PATH THAT WE WOULD BE ON IF WE BUY INTO IT. PAUL: CAN THE U.S. PRESIDENT PUT THE STATUS OF U.S. FORCES IN SOUTH KOREA ON THE TABLE TO NEGOTIATE IN RETURN FOR SOME PROMISE OF DENUCLEARIZATION? YES, I THINK HE CAN. THAT WOULD REALLY UNNERVE THE JAPANESE QUITE A BIT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OR COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL. THAT COULD BE DONE OVER TIME AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL AT ONCE. IT COULD BE A GRADUAL WITHDRAWAL OF THOSE FORCES. LISTEN, IF WE HAVE A PEACE TREATY AND THE WAR HAS ENDED AND KIM JONG UN IS DENUCLEARIZING AND TAKING SYSTEMS, THE REASON TROOPS WOULD BE GOING AWAY, BE ABLE TO PULL ARMIES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER IN THE DMZ. THAT'S SORT OF A HAPPY SOLUTION AND UNLIKELY TO GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I BELIEVE, BUT NONETHELESS, IT WOULD DELEGITIMIZE THE PRESENCE OF 28,000 TROOPS. I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS IN THE BACK OF HIS MIND, NOT INITIALLY BUT EVENTUALLY HE WOULD PUT THOSE TROOPS ON THE TABLE TO GET A FINAL COMPLETION OF DENUCLEARIZATION. PAUL: WHAT ABOUT SECURITY GUARANTIES THAT THE NORTH KOREANS ARE TALKING ABOUT HAVE TALKED ABOUT FOR KIM JONG UN? IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN REALLY PROMISE KIM? HOW CAN WE GUARANTY HIS CONTINUATION IN POWER PARTICULARLY IF THEY OPEN UP TO THE WORLD AND PEOPLE SEE JUST HOW THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE ARE? WELL, IT IS THEIR NUMBER ONE ISSUE, ECONOMICS, PROSPERITY IS NOT THEIR NUMBER ONE ISSUE. THIS IS THE ISSUE, IT'S THE REASON THEY HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND IT'S THE REASON WHY THEY ARE NUCLEAR THEY ARE WEPONIZING ICBM'S BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AT RISK TO GUARANTY THE PRESERVATION OF THE REGIME. WE WILL NEVER GET A DEAL WITH THEM EVEN ON THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO CONVINCE THEM THAT WE ARE PROVIDING A GRANTOR OF THEIR INDEFINITE SECURITY. KIM IS A YOUNG MAN AND HE'S CLEARLY GOT THAT IN MIND AS HE LOOKS TO DECADES AHEAD.
