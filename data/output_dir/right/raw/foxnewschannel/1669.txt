1
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:07,350
>> Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:07,984
WELCOME TO "TUCKER CARLSON

3
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:08,351
TONIGHT."

4
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:08,951
LAST YEAR CONGRESSIONAL

5
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:11,320
REPUBLICANS YOU REMEMBER PAST A

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,555
MAJOR TAX REFORM BILL.

7
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:13,723
IT ACCOMPLISHED A BIG GOAL FOR

8
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:16,459
THEM AND MANY OF THEIR DONORS.

9
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:17,326
A TAX REFORM WASN'T WHAT

10
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:19,929
REPUBLICANS RAN ON IN 2016.

11
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:21,264
POPULAR AS IT MAY BE NOW.

12
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:22,365
AT THE TIME THEY RAN YOU WILL

13
00:00:22,365 --> 00:00:25,334
REMEMBER ON IMMIGRATION AND A

14
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:26,202
PROMISE TO TREAT AMERICA'S

15
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:27,937
BORDERS LIKE THEY ARE ACTUAL

16
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:28,738
BORDERS AND MATTER, LIKE THIS

17
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,940
WAS A REAL COUNTRY.

18
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,542
SOME REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS

19
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:33,376
THINK CONGRESS WANT TO BETRAY

20
00:00:33,376 --> 00:00:35,378
THAT PLEDGE IN THE MOST DRAMATIC

21
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:35,812
POSSIBLE WAY.

22
00:00:35,812 --> 00:00:38,881
THEY'RE WORKING TONIGHT TO PASS

23
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:39,682
A SO-CALLED DISCHARGE PETITION

24
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:41,017
IN THE HOUSE.

25
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:42,018
IT WOULD FORCE BOATS ON A SLEW

26
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:43,119
OF IMMIGRATION MATTERS,

27
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,522
INCLUDING SOME THAT WOULD GIVE

28
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:48,324
AMNESTY TO MILLIONS OF

29
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:48,858
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

30
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:49,358
HOW MANY?

31
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:50,560
WE CAN'T SAY BECAUSE WHEN YOU

32
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,594
PUSH ON THE NUMBERS A LITTLE BIT

33
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:52,829
IT TURNS OUT THAT NOBODY

34
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,864
ACTUALLY KNOWS HOW MANY ILLEGAL

35
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:56,332
IMMIGRANTS LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY.

36
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:57,400
AND WHEN WHEN WE SAY IT NOBODY

37
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,535
KNOWS, WE MEAN NOBODY KNOWS TO

38
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:00,970
WITHIN LIKE 10 MILLION.

39
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,340
THE ESTIMATE YOU HERE FOR ALMOST

40
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,775
EVERYONE IS 11 MILLION.

41
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:06,742
11 MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS LIVING

42
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:07,243
IN THIS COUNTRY.

43
00:01:07,243 --> 00:01:10,880
THAT NUMBER COMES FROM PEW.

44
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,881
IT HASN'T CHANGED IN A DECADE

45
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:13,950
AND THAT SHOULD BE A TIP-OFF

46
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,551
BECAUSE OVER THE LAST DECADE

47
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:16,419
ILLEGAL ARRIVALS HAVE CONTINUED

48
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:19,288
AND NOW STATES ARE ACTIVELY

49
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,323
SABOTAGING DEPORTATION EFFORTS.

50
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:22,325
THE REAL FIGURE IT TURNS OUT IS

51
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:25,595
MUCH, MUCH HIGHER.

52
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:27,964
ICE DIRECTOR ADMITTED THAT MUCH

53
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:28,331
LAST YEAR.

54
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:29,465
WE KNOW 11 MILLION IS NOT

55
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:29,799
CORRECT.

56
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,535
SO WHAT'S THE REAL NUMBER?

57
00:01:32,535 --> 00:01:34,437
AN UNPUBLISHED PAPER BY GALE,

58
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:35,972
THREE PROFESSORS THEIR ESTIMATES

59
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:37,607
THERE COULD BE 23 MILLION

60
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:38,708
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE

61
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,743
UNITED STATES.

62
00:01:40,743 --> 00:01:42,445
THEIR LOW-END ESTIMATE IS

63
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:42,845
17 MILLION.

64
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:46,148
EVEN BACK IN 2005, THE REAL

65
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:49,318
NUMBER WAS PROBABLY 20 MILLION

66
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:49,652
OR MORE.

67
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:51,554
AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE DON'T

68
00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:52,755
KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY ARE HERE

69
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:54,524
BUT SOME MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE

70
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:55,791
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS THINK IT IS A

71
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,026
GOOD IDEA TO GIVE AMNESTY TO

72
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:59,328
SOME OF THEM, OR MAYBE ALL OF

73
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,162
THEM.

74
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,864
IT'S NOT WITH THE VOTERS WANTED,

75
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:04,333
BUT THEY APPARENTLY DON'T CARE.

76
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,035
CONGRESSMAN JEFF DENHAM IS A

77
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:06,636
REPUBLICAN REPRESENTING

78
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:07,303
CALIFORNIA AND HE JOINS US

79
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:07,637
TONIGHT.

80
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:08,538
THANKS FOR COMING OUT.

81
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,573
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK

82
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:11,340
AGAIN.

83
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,041
>> Tucker: SHOULDN'T WE FIGURE

84
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,976
OUT HOW MANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

85
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:17,046
ARE IN THIS COUNTRY BEFORE WE

86
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:19,148
ENCOURAGE MORE TO COME?

87
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:20,316
>> WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS ACTUALLY

88
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:21,517
SECURE OUR BORDER AND THE ONLY

89
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,553
WAY WE WILL GET THE BORDER

90
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:24,687
SECURED IS ACTUALLY WORKING

91
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:25,788
TOGETHER TO PASS SOMETHING OFF

92
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:26,756
THE FLOOR.

93
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:28,758
THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO TALK

94
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:31,527
ABOUT 25 MILLION AND SECURE

95
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:32,361
BORDER MAKING SURE THESE

96
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,663
CARAVANS AREN'T COMING ACROSS,

97
00:02:33,663 --> 00:02:34,564
THE CATCH AND RELEASE PROGRAM.

98
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:35,431
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE ACTUALLY

99
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,733
BRING UP A DEBATE AND ACTUALLY

100
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,602
PUT SOMETHING ON THE PRESIDENT'S

101
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:40,369
DESK.

102
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,171
>> Tucker: WAIT A SECOND.

103
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:43,739
GIVING AMNESTY TO PEOPLE

104
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:44,974
ENCOURAGES MORE PEOPLE TO COME

105
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:45,575
HERE ILLEGALLY.

106
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:48,411
IT WAS TRIED IN 1986 AND THAT

107
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:49,378
WAS ITS EFFECT.

108
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,313
IT'S THE EFFECT EVERY SINGLE

109
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:50,746
TIME.

110
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:53,549
BEFORE WE GET MORE PEOPLE COMING

111
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,051
ACROSS AN BORDER SECURITY NOBODY

112
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:55,718
TAKES SERIOUSLY BECAUSE IT'S

113
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:56,385
ALWAYS BEEN A JOKE, WHY

114
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,386
SHOULDN'T WE KNOW HOW MANY ARE

115
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,156
HERE AND WHY DOESN'T CONGRESS

116
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:01,324
DETERMINED TO FIND OUT HOW MANY

117
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:01,691
ARE HERE?

118
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:03,926
IT SEEMS LIKE KIND OF A BASELINE

119
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:04,226
ISSUE.

120
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,561
>> RATHER THAN JUST DOING A

121
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,329
CENSUS TO FIGURE HOW MANY PEOPLE

122
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:07,196
HERE, WHY DON'T WE STOP THEM

123
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:08,998
FROM COMING HERE IN THE FIRST

124
00:03:08,998 --> 00:03:09,398
PLACE?

125
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,133
DOING NOTHING MEANS ANOTHER

126
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,802
500,000 PEOPLE WILL CROSS OUR

127
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:13,803
BORDER EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

128
00:03:13,803 --> 00:03:14,770
I'VE BEEN IN THE MAJORITY NOW

129
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,172
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

130
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:16,973
THAT'S 4 MILLION PEOPLE.

131
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:19,375
SHOULDN'T WE STOP RIGHT NOW AND

132
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,142
ACTUALLY DO WITH THE

133
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:22,078
PRESIDENT IS ASKING US FOR?

134
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,579
EVEN SOMETHING THE DEMOCRATS HAD

135
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,047
PROPOSED A FEW YEARS AGO AND

136
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:26,949
ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE FUNDING,

137
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:28,484
BUILD THE BORDER SECURITY, DO

138
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:29,986
THE SURVEILLANCE, MAKE SURE THAT

139
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:32,221
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A GUARANTEE TO

140
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:33,422
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT WE'VE

141
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,791
STOPPED THIS INFLUX ACROSS OUR

142
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,258
SOUTHERN BORDER.

143
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,927
>> Tucker: HOW ABOUT THIS,

144
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,696
WOULD YOU SUPPORT PUNISHING ANY

145
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:42,932
EMPLOYER CAUGHT EMPLOYING AN

146
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:43,366
ILLEGAL ALIEN?

147
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,201
REALLY PUNISHING THEM.

148
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:47,203
CHECKING EVERY EMPLOYEE IN

149
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:49,772
AMERICA AND MAKING SURE THAT

150
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:50,873
NOBODY IS EMPLOYING ILLEGAL

151
00:03:50,873 --> 00:03:51,707
ALIENS IN LIEU OF AMERICAN

152
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:52,041
WORKERS.

153
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,143
WHY NOT DO THAT STARTING, I

154
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:55,378
DON'T KNOW, TOMORROW?

155
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:57,546
>> AS YOU KNOW, AND A GOVERNMENT

156
00:03:57,546 --> 00:03:58,981
PROGRAM, ESPECIALLY A NEW

157
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:00,383
GOVERNMENT PROGRAM THAT NEEDS

158
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:02,018
TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T START

159
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:02,385
TOMORROW.

160
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:03,786
I DO SUPPORT E-VERIFY.

161
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:07,256
I DO SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE --

162
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:09,458
>> Tucker: UNIVERSAL E-VERIFY?

163
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,159
>> ABSOLUTELY.

164
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,094
BUT WE HAVE TO FIX THE REST OF

165
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:15,164
OUR IMMIGRATION PROCESS FIRST.

166
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:15,865
REPUBLICANS HAVE SET FOR QUITE

167
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:18,166
SOME TIME NOW WE WILL NOT PASS A

168
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:18,834
COMPREHENSIVE BILL, BUT YET

169
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:22,171
THAT'S WHAT      THAT'S WHAT'S B

170
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:22,204
THAT'S WHAT      THAT'S WHAT'S I

171
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:22,571
THAT'S WHAT      THAT'S WHAT'S G

172
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,039
PROPOSED TODAY.

173
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:24,206
THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT

174
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:25,574
DEALING WITH BORDER SECURITY,

175
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:26,609
DEALING WITH OUR DREAMERS RIGHT

176
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:28,611
NOW BECAUSE THEY ARE IN A

177
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:29,545
DIFFERENT SITUATION AFTER

178
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:30,946
FOLLOWING THEIR GOVERNMENT AND

179
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:31,747
SIGNING UP FOR DACA.

180
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:34,950
WE NEED TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE.

181
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,985
>> Tucker: FOLLOWING OUR

182
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:36,385
GOVERNMENT?

183
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:38,254
WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME HERE

184
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:39,155
ILLEGALLY WITH THEIR PARENTS?

185
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,556
>> NO.

186
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:41,757
IF WE HAD A PRESIDENT THAT

187
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:43,659
PASSED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER, WHICH

188
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,094
I DISAGREED WITH, BUT

189
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:45,795
NEVERTHELESS THE PRESIDENT OF

190
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:48,531
THE UNITED STATES PASSED AN

191
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:49,765
EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT ALLOWED

192
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,367
DACA RECIPIENTS TO STEP FORWARD.

193
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:52,535
THESE KIDS WHO HAVE GRADUATED

194
00:04:52,535 --> 00:04:53,769
FROM OUR HIGH SCHOOLS, WHO HAVE

195
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:54,970
GROWN UP IN THIS COUNTRY, WHO

196
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,473
KNOW OF NO OTHER COUNTRY OR NO

197
00:04:57,473 --> 00:04:58,841
OTHER HOME, THEY'VE DONE WITH

198
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,109
THEIR COUNTRY HAS ASKED THEM TO

199
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:02,378
DO AND THEY'VE SIGNED UP FOR

200
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:03,946
THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER UNDER DACA.

201
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:05,381
>> Tucker: THEY ARE NOT

202
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:06,015
CITIZENS.

203
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:06,348
OKAY.

204
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,683
LET'S JUST BACK UP.

205
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,985
>> THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR DECADES

206
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:10,653
>> THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR DECADE

207
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:14,090
DECADES.

208
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,590
>> Tucker: RIGHT.

209
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,991
I'M JUST SAYING IN A WORLD WHERE

210
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:16,792
THERE ARE A LOT OF PRIORITIES,

211
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,994
WHY IS THIS YOUR NUMBER ONE

212
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:19,795
PRIORITY?

213
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:21,464
IN YOUR STATE YOU GOT MORE THAN

214
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:23,966
100,000 PEOPLE LIVING ON THE

215
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:24,767
SIDEWALK, THOSE ARE AMERICAN

216
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:25,134
CITIZENS.

217
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:26,802
WHY DON'T YOU DEAL WITH A

218
00:05:26,802 --> 00:05:28,070
PROBLEM LIKE THAT FIRST BEFORE

219
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,205
YOU START PASSING OUT

220
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:30,773
CITIZENSHIP TO PEOPLE HERE

221
00:05:30,773 --> 00:05:31,574
ILLEGALLY?

222
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:32,374
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

223
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,442
>> THE KIND OF AN ARGUMENT THAT

224
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:35,377
I GET FROM SOME OF THE LIBERAL

225
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,746
NETWORKS, WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A

226
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:38,380
PRIORITY OR THIS PRIORITY?

227
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,782
I BELIEVE ON ADDRESSING A NUMBER

228
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:41,951
OF DIFFERENT ISSUES AT THE SAME

229
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:45,488
TIME.

230
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:49,158
>> Tucker: LOOK, GIVING

231
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:49,959
CITIZENSHIP AND VOTING RIGHTS TO

232
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,561
PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY IS

233
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,796
NOT A WAY OF SECURING OUR

234
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:54,497
BORDER, SO WHY WOULDN'T YOU

235
00:05:54,497 --> 00:05:57,366
SECURE THE BORDER FIRST?

236
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:58,267
>> WE HAVE TWO ISSUES THAT THE

237
00:05:58,267 --> 00:05:59,769
PRESIDENT HAS ASKED FOR,

238
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:00,770
INCLUDING HIS FOUR PILLARS, BUT

239
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,938
THE MAIN THING HE CONTINUES TO

240
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:05,407
TALK ABOUT, THE PRESIDENT ASKS

241
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,376
FOR A SOLUTION ON DACA AND FOR

242
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:07,843
BORDER SECURITY.

243
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:10,479
I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GIVE HIM

244
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:10,780
BOTH.

245
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,783
>> Tucker: OKAY.

246
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:15,050
LET'S LEAVE THE PRESIDENT OUT OF

247
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,351
THIS.

248
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:17,553
IT JUST AS SOMEONE WHO IS HIRED

249
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:18,788
TO REPRESENT AMERICAN CITIZENS,

250
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:20,356
SPEAK SLOWLY SO I CAN

251
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:21,957
UNDERSTAND, WHY WOULD WE GIVE

252
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:22,958
CITIZENSHIP TO ANYBODY HERE

253
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:23,759
ILLEGALLY, GIVE VOTING RIGHTS TO

254
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,364
ANYONE WHOSE FAMILY CAME HERE

255
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:30,132
ILLEGALLY BEFORE NOT A SINGLE

256
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:32,101
NEW PERSON CROSSING THE BORDER

257
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:32,468
ILLEGALLY?

258
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:34,103
UNTIL YOU CAN LOOK YOUR VOTERS

259
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,404
IN THE FACE AND SAY OUR BORDER

260
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:38,374
IS SECURE, NOW WE CAN MAYBE GIVE

261
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:39,575
CITIZENSHIP TO ILLEGALS.

262
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:40,776
>> THAT DYNAMIC CHANGED UNDER

263
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:41,377
THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT.

264
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:43,946
FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T BELIEVE IN

265
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:44,547
GIVING ANYBODY ANYTHING.

266
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:46,015
THIS WILL BE AN EARNED PATHWAY.

267
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,049
BY ALL OF THE DIFFERENT BILLS IT

268
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:50,152
WOULD BE AT LEAST A 10-12 YEAR

269
00:06:50,152 --> 00:06:50,553
PROCESS.

270
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:51,854
FIRST SIGNED UP FOR FIVE YEARS

271
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:53,956
OF A TEMPORARY GREEN CARD THAT

272
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,491
WOULD ALLOW YOU TO WORK OR GO TO

273
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,226
SCHOOL OR SIGN UP FOR THE

274
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:58,761
MILITARY AND AT THE END OF FIVE

275
00:06:58,761 --> 00:06:59,395
YEARS, AFTER YOU PASS THE

276
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,764
BACKGROUND CHECK, YOU HAVE PAID

277
00:07:01,764 --> 00:07:03,199
YOUR FINE AND YOUR FEE, YOU'VE

278
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,900
ACTUALLY PROVEN THAT YOU ARE NOT

279
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,068
ON GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES AND YOU

280
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:07,570
ARE OUT THERE WORKING OR GOING

281
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,171
TO SCHOOL OR SERVING YOUR

282
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,573
COUNTRY AT THE END OF FIVE

283
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:11,006
YEARS.

284
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:12,508
>> Tucker: NONE OF THAT'S

285
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:15,377
REAL.

286
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:18,347
>> WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IS

287
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:19,348
ANOTHER FIVE YEARS, DOING IT ALL

288
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:21,584
OVER AGAIN, SO IT'S A 12 YEAR

289
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:22,284
PROCESS, TEN YEARS BEFORE HE

290
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:24,153
WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET A

291
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:27,356
LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENT CARD.

292
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:29,558
>> Tucker: MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

293
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:30,960
WANT TO COME HERE.

294
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,361
WHY WOULD YOU GIVE A PATH TO

295
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:34,363
CITIZENSHIP FOR PEOPLE HERE

296
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:35,764
ILLEGALLY AHEAD OF PEOPLE WHO

297
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:37,867
ARE WAITING IN LINE, OBEYING OUR

298
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:38,167
LAWS?

299
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,969
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

300
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,170
I'M CONFUSED I GUESS.

301
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,138
>> IT'S A 12 YEAR PROCESS AND I

302
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:45,140
BELIEVE THAT THIS EARNED PATHWAY

303
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,875
BELIEVE THAT THIS EARNED PATHWA

304
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:46,609
PATHWAY, THIS EARNED 12 YEAR

305
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:47,576
PROCESS WOULD PUT YOU AT THE

306
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:48,878
BACK OF THE LINE BUT CERTAINLY

307
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:50,546
SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN HERE, WHO'S

308
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:51,313
GRADUATED FROM OUR SCHOOLS THAT

309
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:54,116
HAS BEEN IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT

310
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:57,253
HAS FOLLOWED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER

311
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:59,321
UNDER OBAMA SHOULD HAVE THAT

312
00:07:59,321 --> 00:07:59,722
OPPORTUNITY.

313
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:02,591
>> Tucker: OKAY I GUESS.

314
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:03,359
>> I DON'T GET AN OPPORTUNITY

315
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,561
JUST TO SIT BACK AND WAIT AND

316
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:06,562
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

317
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:07,963
>> Tucker: AS A CONGRESSMAN

318
00:08:07,963 --> 00:08:08,697
REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA YOU GOT

319
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,167
A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

320
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,168
>> CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT OF

321
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:13,769
PROBLEMS.

322
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:14,169
YES.

323
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:15,371
>> Tucker: YEAH, YOU DO.

324
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,672
SO LIKE WHY WOULD THIS BE

325
00:08:16,672 --> 00:08:18,073
ANYWHERE NEAR THE TOP OF YOUR

326
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:19,174
PRIORITY LIST?

327
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:21,076
I'M JUST COMPLETELY CONFUSED.

328
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:23,545
THESE ARE NOT AMERICAN CITIZENS.

329
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,147
TENS OF MILLIONS OF HURTING

330
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:25,814
AMERICAN CITIZENS IN YOUR

331
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:27,149
PUTTING THESE PEOPLE HAD OF THEM

332
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:28,584
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

333
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:29,985
>> YOU ARE ELECTED TO LEAD AND

334
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:32,054
WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ON THE

335
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,087
PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNED ON BORDER

336
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:33,455
SECURITY.

337
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:35,190
THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO GET

338
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,491
THAT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE RULES

339
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:38,227
OF THIS HOUSE AND THE SENATE,

340
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,695
YOU'VE GOT TO GET 60 VOTES.

341
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:42,364
THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL GET THE 60

342
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:44,066
MEMBERS ON A BIPARTISAN BORDER

343
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:44,833
SECURITY BILL IS WITH A SOLUTION

344
00:08:44,833 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT
