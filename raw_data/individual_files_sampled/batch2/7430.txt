new allegations of sexual harassment assault and misconduct have been raised against actor Kevin Spacey this time coming from the set of house of cards in a detailed report by CNN people that worked on the set with Kevin Spacey witnesses have all come forward speaking out against his misconduct all eight people each of whom spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional repercussions for speaking out described Spacey's behavior as predatory saying it included non-consensual touching and crude comments and targeted production staffers who were typically young and male now following the allegations released by actor Anthony Rapp Spacey said through his publicist on Wednesday that he was seeking unspecified treatment now since that even came out that publicist Stacy Wolfe said she and creative arts agency were parting ways with the actor production of season six of the series was shut down this week Netflix the production company media rights capital issued a joint statement Tuesday to say that they are reviewing the situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew Spacey is also one of the show's executive producer now the report goes into a lot of detail of allegations people coming forward and speaking on the record though again anonymous and in part what they echo is the following quote I have no doubt that this type of predatory behavior was routine for him and that my experience was one of many and that Kevin had few if any qualms about exploiting his status and position this is coming from a crew member who drove him to set it was a toxic environment for young men who had to interact with him at all in the crew cast background actors the other people who worked on house of cards with whom CNN spoke all supported the idea that the set could be toxic for young men because of Spacey a crew member who worked on the show for all six seasons said that Spacey routinely harassed and touched him Netflix and MRC have sort of scrambled to issue statements with these new allegations coming forward Netflix is saying that they were just made aware of an incident that occurred five years ago on the set of house of cards and they're trying to figure out if it was if it was resolved swiftly which they said they were informed that it was MRC the production company behind house of cards issued a separate statement on Thursday saying quote we have consistently reinforced the importance of employees reporting any incident without fear of retaliation and we have investigated and taken appropriate actions following any complaints for example during our first year production in 2012 someone on the cruise shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey immediate action was taken following our review of the situation and we are confident the issue is resolved promptly through the satisfaction of all involved mr. Spacey willingly participated in a training process and since that time MRC has not been made aware of any other complaints involving mr. spacey now this specifically really doesn't hold up that because obviously there are a whole bunch of people coming forward saying that allegations had that situations had come out following this incident in 2012 and but I didn't I thought they said they hadn't been reported though now that they've been spoken to by other people on the crew so obviously these people didn't it didn't sound like they were actually comfortable to come forward for fear of losing their job which was something that a lot of people are saying one crew member says quote who is going to believe crew members you're going to get fired another person said it was very known that Kevin was inappropriate and males I work with complain to me about how they felt uncomfortable so Ben I'm just gonna toss over to you because you're the you know you're the movie guy what was your response to all these accusations I guess of the TV show and how Netflix handled it MRC I don't know we you know we don't know how they handled it yet they said they handled it one five years ago people hadn't come to them if they hadn't come to them then theoretically there's nothing they could have done although you would think after one incident then what we're seeing now you would go and have a staff wide meeting and say hey anybody with any complaint you don't have anything to fear and you come to us and it does not appear they did that so you know we're living in a different world now and I'm it feels like that that world is never gonna go backwards it feels like this is a signatory to a tipping point that seemed obvious even before Kevin Spacey the allegations against Kevin Spacey came about you know I hope they deal with this swiftly I'm curious I would love to have seen because all these companies NPR as well as the MRC and and and Netflix they all claim that they addressed these issues with these powerful people that uh in at each of these institutions I would like to have seen how those were addressed right I don't imagine I've just I have no way of knowing I'm just I doubt Kevin Spacey got a real dressing down right he's executive for sure the show the show the show is his Kevin space certainly was five years ago right I mean you couldn't have gone on the show wouldn't now they could probably go on without him they could probably get another season which they say is their last thing is probably if they got rid of him they might be able to get two or three seasons out of it but back then they couldn't so I'm curious when they say they dealt with it swiftly and Kevin participated like III would love to know exactly what that man and that they they say you know that they felt that they had dealt with in a way that was comprehensive but it obviously that didn't really bleed down to the lower ranks of people working on the show they still felt that they could only confide in other people that were of that same level because again you're talking about relaying against the executive producer of the show you went up a level because there a couple instances there well there one like a PA would say something to an ad in the ad would say Amen you know this is that this is what it's like you know buy a coffee it was an unknown culture of that Sh right so I don't know we don't know what they did we don't know whether that's sufficient of course these are private matters so the whole point is is that you wouldn't have announced to the show the Kevin Spacey had been charged we had been accused to something but you would think that maybe at least now we know that if somebody comes forward you gotta go to the whole company and say hey you guys need to feel comfortable coming forward and please do uh but they have ceded that that doesn't appear to be in the case five years ago there wasn't case five all right so you know I mean the mistake of checking the comments on one of our other sexual harassment videos and yeah look guys you know back in the good old days of YouTube and you could actually look at the comments and get something out of it even if it was a critique but oh okay that's an interesting point now of course there's lots of craziness going on there but so a lot of the guys were not all and I remember the trolls are a tiny tiny percentage of the audience but a lot of them were like oh man now you can polish people for crude comments that's not a favor no look it's it it's several different things going on here one is if you got a crude comment of two different citizens that ran across each other at a bar that's one thing it's another one someone can control your job and keeps making crude comments at you an effort to hit on you that's sexual harassment in the workplace and then on and that's the least of it here you've got non-consensual touching gone gone you can't have that that's crazy let alone by the boss right and and then it's not one person it's a people and then there's the underage people that Spacey in a different context is alleged to have yeah and I do think an important component of the story too is his predatory behavior was predominantly expressed towards men and men are as we know statistically far less likely to come forward with their allegations of abuse because there's such a stigma against sexual abuse and men and there's a there's a I didn't know that just check out I was reading in preparation for this story just go to head on to rain org Rai and an organ you can read about the statistics of men who are under report any sexual abuse so I think that's a component in this story as well along with the power dynamic that was at play when again I just can't get over the fact that how are you gonna complain about the misconduct of the executive producer and lead actor Academy award-winning Emmy winning behavior who I think you make a great point Ben he was the show house of cards was Kevin Spacey you tuned in because it was a Kevin Spacey project and and so III empathize I sympathize so much with the men coming forward the people coming forward because they must have felt so incredibly powerless yeah and and i think that i'm what i'm trying to get beyond probably needlessly so is people who think like i come on guys you know in the old days there's a big star the big star hits on the actresses on the cetera in this case the guys on the set that's just life right well it depends it depends on the power dynamic he's the executive producer he could fire you so that's not a come on if you don't sleep with me maybe i admire you and if he doesn't have to say that to what the bosses and could be an implicit threat and and so it's much harder to complain about the boss so it's not come on anything and this is a business somebody wrote about this today and I apologize for not recalling who it was but why we're at least now reading about so much of this in the entertainment industry is because it's a particularly vulnerable subset of people you know the overwhelming majority of people in the Screen Actors Guild they're not gonna make a dollar this year right you know these jobs are enormous ly hard to get and they're hard to get in production - and you're in this business and you get a job and you get a job on a successful show that appears to run Netflix is throwing money around you're like oh my god I can't believe I'm on this show the show could run seven years I could I could relax I could take a deep breath I'm gonna make at least 40 grand from these run of this show this year and maybe I'm gonna have to get another gig and so yeah and under that given that situation you think well I'm not gonna rock the boat so then it becomes incumbent on Netflix and MRC to have stepped forward in a way to make this the Dakota they didn't do but I don't think anybody hardly meant in each of the cases I don't know whether anybody did in the cases we're reading about companies haven't moved with the speed which way they are moving now in the wake it's you know it's only been four weeks since the New York Times broke the first Weinstein story yes some wore wings and that's we've seen a total change in in how this is dealt with and and and that obviously each day is a different revelation we we've changed the time-space continuum mister things are moving so fast Harvey Weinstein feels like years ago right if you like this clip of The Young Turks you know there's a whole live two-hour show 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern every day and you could download it or stream in and watch it without ads if you become a member TYT Network comm /join
