FIVE-YEAR PRISON TERMS. MIKE. Mike: TRACE GALLAGHER ON THE IMMIGRATION BEAT IN OUR LOS ANGELES NEWSROOM. MANY THANKS. ARKANSAS G.O.P. GOVERNOR HUTCHINSON WAS ONE OF THE GOVERNOR 'S DINING WITH THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT. BORDER SECURITY WAS ON THE MENU. HE JOINS US NOW. GOOD EVENING. GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. Mike: YOUR READ OUT OF DINNER TONIGHT WITH THE PRESIDENT? HE WAS IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS. HE HAD WORKED HARD ALL DAY TODAY WITH A LOT OF NEWS HAPPENING. WE TALKED ABOUT BORDER SECURITY WITH A HANDFUL OF GOVERNORS, SOME OF THEM COMING FROM BORDER STATES AND WE WERE ABLE TO ANSWER THE PRESIDENT'S CALL FOR THE STATES FOR NATIONAL GUARD RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR SECURITY EFFORTS. I THINK THIS IS A WAY FOR THE PRESIDENT TO THANK SOME OF THOSE GOVERNORS. I WAS DELIGHTED TO BE THERE TONIGHT. CLEARLY WE HAD AN INCREASE IN ILLEGAL CROSSINGS. I SEE THIS AS A SEARCH OPPORTUNITY TO GET A BETTER HANDLE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T SPIKE OR CONTINUE TO GO UP AND THOSE ILLEGAL CROSSINGS. Mike: THE REPORTS UNACCOMPANIED MINORS COULD BE HOUSED AT LITTLE ROCK AIR FORCE BASE, HERE'S HOW KIRSTJEN NIELSEN EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM. IF YOU BREAK THE LAW AND YOU HAPPEN TO BE A PARENT YOU WILL BE INCARCERATED. IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU WILL BE SEPARATED. THAT'S NOT SO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE DO IN THE UNITED STATES EVERY DAY. Mike: YOUR REACTION TO PERHAPS SOME UNACCOMPANIED MINORS BEING HOUSED AT A BASE IN YOUR STATE POSSIBLY? I KNOW THEY HAVE PUT ON A LIST OF NUMBER OF MILITARY INSTALLATIONS OR POSSIBLY HOUSING UNACCOMPANIED MINORS. WE DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION BUT LITTLE ROCK AIR FORCE BASE IS ON THAT LIST AND WE ARE ANXIOUS TO COOPERATE AND GET MORE DETAILS ON THAT. CLEARLY, AND I'VE BEEN AT HOMELAND SECURITY AND I'VE LOOKED AT THAT BORDER AND HERE YOU'VE GOT A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF UNACCOMPANIED MINORS COMING ACROSS AND YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR THEM, YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR THEM AND IF MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IS AN APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR THAT THAN I UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNMENT LOOKING AT THOSE. STILL AWAIT MORE INFORMATION ON ADDRESSING THAT VERY CHALLENGING ME THAT WE HAVE. Mike: YOU MADE REFERENCE TO YOUR PERSONAL BIOGRAPHY, FORMER UNDERSECRETARY OF DHS AND ALSO A DEA BACKGROUND. TALK TO US A BIT ABOUT THE BORDER SITUATION. FOR SOME NEW IDEAS DISCUSSED AT DINNER TONIGHT OR DO YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS FROM BEING OUTSIDE THE WASHINGTON BUBBLE OF THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING? SECRETARY NIELSEN WAS THERE AS WELL. GREAT CONVERSATION ON THE CHALLENGES OF BORDER SECURITY. THERE'S A LOT OF TOOLS THAT ARE NEEDED THAT CONGRESS HAS NOT PROVIDED OUR BORDER AGENTS AND OUR IMMIGRATION JUDGES SO THAT WE CAN DIS- INCENTIVIZE ILLEGAL CROSSINGS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE ARE SO MANY INCENTIVES THAT IF YOU GET ACROSS THAT BORDER AND YOU WIND UP IN COURT AND YOU COULD BE RELEASED, YOU COULD FADE INTO THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE. YOU DON'T APPEAR IN COURT. THOSE OF THE KIND OF THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE CORRECTED. AS LONG AS THERE IS AN INCENTIVE FOR THOSE TO COME ACROSS ILLEGALLY, THAT MAGNET IS GOING TO DRAW THEM. WE HAVE TO DIS- INCENTIVIZE THAT WE HAVE TO DIS- INCENTIVIZE THA THAT. THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS CONCENTRATING ON AND IT'S SOMETHING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORT. Mike: DESCRIBED THE PRESIDENT BEING IN GOOD SPIRITS BUT HE SEEMS REALLY KIND OF STRESSED ABOUT THE WHOLE PORTER SITUATION. DID YOU GET A SENSE OF THAT ALTERNATE? ABSOLUTELY. HE'S INTENSE ON IT. HE'S FRUSTRATED BECAUSE OF THE OBSTACLES AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE CAMPAIGNED ON, SOMETHING THAT HE BELIEVES IN INHERENTLY AND WE ALL BELIEVE IN IMMIGRANT FLOW TO OUR COUNTRY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY AND OUR FUTURE BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE LEGAL PATH. YOU'VE GOT TO CONTROL THE BORDER. HE FEELS VERY INSTINCTIVE ABOUT THAT, VERY COMMITTED TO IT AND PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. Mike: 50 GOVERNORS IN THE COUNTRY, YOU WERE ONE OF THEM INVITED TO DINNER TONIGHT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR YOU PERSONALLY? IT MEANT A LOT. PERSONAL TIME WITH THE PRESIDENT, IT WAS WITH SOME OTHER GOOD GOVERNORS TALKING ABOUT SOME VERY SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES, PEOPLE OF ARKANSAS, WE HAVE INCREDIBLE VALUE IN THE RULE OF LAW SO WE APPRECIATE THE PRESIDENT BEING COMMITTED TO IT. IT WAS A GREAT EVENING AND I APPRECIATE THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL SUPPORT OF OUR NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS AS THEY
