just a super quick update the nice that
family has been doing an incredible job
of murdering this gigantic bucket of
Nutella here not bad not bad that's a
significant gap right there we will have
that thing empty by the end of the week
I've kind of been freaking out a little
bit because work work is my life it's
like my lifeline it's like my energy
source my happiness source work is my
everything and since we got to Los
Angeles there's just been so many
variables like getting situated and the
house and Candis has been sick the baby
has been sick oh and just got here I
haven't been as productive as I normally
am productivity equals happiness a lack
of productivity for me equals I don't
know somewhere between absolute
frustration and rage since I've been in
Los Angeles I've been hovering somewhere
between the two
but that's going to change this morning
I'm on my way right now to meet a friend
of mine named Ryan holiday you should
look him up and I are meeting to discuss
this really big ambitious project that
we are just now embarking on how you
doing thank you very much
yeah welcome to Los Angeles
ma'am do you think we have to ask
permission to sit here we have
commandeered this very private
almost cabana style area at this fancy
hotel for our business meeting I realize
I'm being a little bit sketchy about not
saying we're actually doing but it's
gonna be big and it's gonna be exciting
and this is Ryan
you feel good about good walking out
right now I'll walk out of you dude
awesome to see you see you I'll see you
tomorrow morning
yeah run alright later Ryan
guys are awesome what are you guys doing
out here
god I feel so much better so it's a
really just stimulating fantastic
conversation that really contextualized
the project that he and I are about to
do there's one thing that I wrote down
which Ryan has said to me before and
this is like a known and that people say
but never let perfect be the enemy of
good enough that principle really
articulates what these vlogs are for me
prior to vlogging I used to put out
maybe a movie a month or something like
that and my excuse for not being more
prolific was always that I want what I
make to be perfect and I guess if you're
Stanley Kubrick or Quinton turned you
know there is validity in that argument
but in retrospect that argument was just
an excuse for me to not make more by no
longer letting myself embrace that
excuse I've forced myself to be more
prolific and it was via that
proliferation via that increased output
of my own medium his movies then I found
my voice and I found I think a renewed
passion for what has been my craft great
eating there's like this
who you is AP right we saw that
gamescape bit that's testing you from
central go back now you're dancing you
answer back again lovable mother good
