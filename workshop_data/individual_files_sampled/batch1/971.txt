in the ceremonial heart of Beijing China's political season is about to start but it'll be different this year delegates to the National People's Congress are being asked to do something they've never had to before approve a change to the Constitution that restricts presidents to two terms dissenting voices are rare in today's China yet in the run-up to this NPC there's been token criticism over the proposed amendment most of the modern countries in the world adopt this two-term presidency that's why people find it unbelievable that as she is going to stay in power more than two terms President Xi is likely to get his way the NPC is viewed as a largely rubber-stamp body controlled by the ruling Communist Party and has never voted down a proposal from party leaders the change will further consolidate Xi's power as he's also party chief and head of the military and in October his name was enshrined in the Constitution elevating him to the status of Chairman Mao like President Trump Xi Jingping wants to make his country great again and he often talks about the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation he now believes he's the only leader that can make that happen there are no opinion polls in China so it's not possible to gauge what the public thinks about all of this a few people in Beijing though were willing to share their views and surprisingly they weren't all positive this hasn't happened in China or other countries before if he changed the Constitution like this then it's back to the old days we're moving backwards he should be prison for more than two terms even he serves six I would support him China today is a one-party state dominated now by one man Adrian Brown al-jazeera Beijing
