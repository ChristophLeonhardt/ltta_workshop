I hate to say it but summer is drawing to a close and that means we only have a few days left to panic over nothing and blame Donald Trump you see summer is that lovely time of year when government business comes to a halt and the news slows down so journalists finally have some time in which they can really dig deep into meaningless incidents in order to scare us and make us hate one another and then blame Trump remember remember the whole Trump is a Russian spy thing yeah neither do i but if you look back at some of your favorite family snapshots you may catch a picture of two or two of your liberal aunt Cecile watching CNN and muttering oh my god the Russians hacked our elections and even though I don't even know what that means and even though I if I took the time to do a little research I discover that nothing even remotely like that ever happened I'm in a total panic about it I'm sure that Donald Trump is in league with Vladimir Putin whoever he is and now our country's in thrall to Russia like Keith Olbermann says whoever he is hi yes panicking over Russia those with some days of summer fun weren't they there were demands that Trump should be impeached for some reason and serious-looking commentators claiming that even though nobody was hacked and none of the votes were affected we should all be very concerned because something something something and during all that panic over absolutely nothing the Justice Department got conned into appointing a special counsel who is sure to get to the bottom of who didn't hack anything and who exactly is responsible for the fact that the vote was accurate good times my friend good times it's too bad autumns on the way and they'll be real news taking place and we'll just be too busy to blame Trump for something that never happened which he wasn't involved in any way but who will ever forget our fond summer memories of Charlottesville when somehow the media called us into panicking over the fact that about 17 of the 323 million people in our country are white supremacists dirtbags who lure you in with tiki torches and then won't even serve you a poopoo platter I can't even remember how they got us to think but Nazi and fascist leftist punching each other in killing people with somehow donald trump's fault but she sure was a swell old time wasn't it i hate to think that come September we'll have to leave this sort of nonsensical fun behind and get back down to the business of reading and thinking about things that actually affect our lives as a nation but you know even though these lazy hazy crazy panicking crazies stupid empty meaningless crazy lazy days of summer will be over you can be sure that they'll still be stupid stuff to send us into a frenzy of hating one another and blaming trump all you'll have to do is turn on CNN or read the New York Times and it will be just like summer never ended trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show well that was a Clavin

go to the post office again alright there's never too much we can say about a hurricane I mean the only thing is of course is a lot of toxic masculinity out there of guys rescuing people and it's it's always the only thing to remember is you do see these pictures and I don't want to sentimentalize it but it is true these are people of all colors who are in trouble and the people of all colors who are going out there to help them that's the real story that's actually happening day after day after day in America that is what America is Fox News said it takes what do you say takes a catastrophe to bring us back together no it doesn't just turn takes turning off the news you know it's just turning off CNN and suddenly you realize we don't hate each other that is not what's going on you know which is a good reason I want to start with this video that was taken of James Madison Secretary of Defense he was touring some overseas bases talking to the military you know getting out there and greeting the guys and they don't know exactly where this was he was in Jordan he was in Turkey he was in a bunch of places but I've been to you know places like this I was in Afghanistan and the places like this and the guys are out there and they are people same thing all different colors all different places different politics you know people always think that the military is conservative maybe it's more conservative than the population I don't know but the people I met you know Democrats Republicans are all out there serving the country and and he gave them a talk about this about the difference between the collaboration and togetherness that you find in the military where you're working for a mission and our country which unemployment is non-existent racism let's face it institutional racism is gone racism in fact is nothing like what it used to be ever it's nothing close you know we're rich we're basically at peace even though we're fighting these small kind of imperial type wars and Empire type Wars and the in the distance you know the country is actually okay and the only it's only the people who were fighting with each other and he talks about this a little bit this is James Madison to the Troops I know you can all be going to college he young people or you could be back on the block just grateful the only way the only way this great big experiment you call it you and I call America better survive so we got tough hombres like you and you remember some of you two young hopeful one but on 9/11 we racked up against an enemy that's not if you heard us you can scare us we don't frickin scare at the bottom line a lot here we'll fight alongside our friends and allies and we're going to keep right on fighting until they're sick of us leave us alone and they're buying time you're a great example for our country it's got problems that we won't we don't have in the military and you did you just hold the line my finding soldiers sailors airmen oh just hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other and showing it being friendly to one another you know that Americans owe to one another we're so doggone lucky to be Americans we got two powers power of inspirations you'll get the power of inspiration back you got the power of intimidation and that's you if someone wants to screw with our families and our country our allies okay so thanks so much for being out of here right completely by surprise that's good keep you okay like me guessing the only reason I came back off it's a very moving talking about the fact that they are holding the line while we get things together they're keeping the enemy at bay while we learn not to be enemies among ourselves and we're divided at every level I mean obviously the left and right are divided we're gonna bring on knowles michael knowles from the michael nor show to talk about that was happening in berkeley and the just the ferocious attempt of the far left us to shut down the right Knowles by the way we'll come on after we leave Facebook and YouTube so you will have to come over to the Daily wire calm and listen to it if you want to watch the whole thing you subscribe it's a lousy ten bucks a month I mean come on said ten bucks a month you can watch the whole show and if you subscribe for the year it's a hundred bucks for the whole year and you get the leftist tears tumblr my friend come on it keeps your left is tears hot it keeps them cold it keeps them stocked because it refills automatically every time Donald Trump makes a speech so you'll want to do that but you know we're divided every level so this is the right and the left but then you know this Trump and basically the Republican Party are not so the Republican Party is divided between the Trump supporters and the people who are not so sure of Trump and even some who don't like it and you know there's all there's divisions in the administration where the Bannen people have been are being forced out and we don't really know like are these are the people who are remaining are they Democrats like Ivanka you know is that gonna be what the Trump administration morphs into so we saw all of this with the you know the pardon of Joe Arpaio went on and like I said this would be that this would be the big story I mean this would be the screaming yelling story and our pay Oh obviously the sheriff who was in Arizona who was very very tough on illegal immigrants and was stopping people if they looked like there were illegal immigrants and he was accused of racial profiling he was accused of brutality in his prisons he had a he had so many people he actually had a tenth prison at one point he dressed people up in pink wasn't that one of the things he did and and well here let's just listen he was on Hannity moments after his accusation the thing that was he was a big big Trump ally he supported Trump all the way still supports him and supported Trump when he was doing that nonsense about the birtherism you know where was where was Obama born which I saw differently than everybody else everybody left to call that racist which I never I never thought it was racist I I thought that was two trolls fighting it was the Obama troll Obama was a great great troll he drove the right crazy I mean you have to give credit where credit is due Obama drove us crazy and he knew he was doing it and he knew how to do it and he knew how to set us off and Trump just called his bluff he went after him and said basically you've been trolling us by not showing us this thing I don't believe you I don't believe you're actually you're actually born in American every said racist races races which was the knee-jerk reaction to the left to any criticism of Barack Obama but I just thought it was troll versus troll remember Mad Magazine use of spy versus spy this was a troll versus troll and RPO supported Trump in that craziness and here he is celebrating his his part it's great I love that president he supports law enforcement very humble if you recall two years ago I supported him and I said publicly recently pardon or no pardon I will be with it to the end and I'm going to have a news conference early next week and get to the bottom of this until the abuse of the judicial system and politics I'm not going down without trying to defend myself to all those people that don't like what I've done so the hurricane forced a lot of this to second place but of course everybody who has any kind of political ambitions for the presidency next time out immediately rushed forward to either condemn or praise it Joe Biden who still is living under the delusion that someday somebody might be foolish enough to vote for him for press this big article how we're fighting over the soul of the country and this just shows what a racist his Kasich Ohio the Ohio Governor John Kasich he is always out there thinking he's got he is another guy I mean he just stayed in those primaries forever because he just can't get over the daydream that somebody's gonna elect this guy president and he went out and attacked Trump for this pardon I actually have the power of pardoning in my state we do clemencies overtime but we make sure that people did proper restitution I wouldn't have done it this way and it's not it is absolutely should be out of bounds for somebody to use that as some sort of a political wedge it appears as though that's what it what it was it's not the way I operate here with the power to be able to give people second chance that the president has that power I don't agree with what he did it's not the way I operate I can't be anymore you know anymore loud and what I have to say than to tell you what I do because my actions reflect the way I feel so I'm gonna tell you what I think about this in a minute but I want to let all the different sides speak John McCain Jeff Flake the senators from Arizona they went after Trump to McCain said the president has the authority to make this pardon but doing so at this time undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law as Mr Ohio has shown no remorse for his actions just just to be clear he was ordered by a federal court to stop basically targeting Hispanic people I think that that would be the best way to say it he told them he was doing it but he didn't he continued his policies and they held him in contempt of court so Steve King a big big strong border advocate he went out and he attacked flake in McCain he struck back Congressman Steve King struck back against the flake in McCain well I would think I probably spent more time with you or a pyro than either one of them but you know these they're they have been essentially for open borders they don't want to see in our immigration laws of course they don't want to build a wall you don't want to secure the border they want amnesty they've been for amnesty for all of their political life and so you often see people take a position this consistent was what they hope gets accomplished with regard to their policies that they favor rather than an objective look and I just I just watched this political person and take place under the Obama administration and when they pulled the 287g program from Maricopa County at that time it was conclusive to me that it was that it was an effort to prohibit him from enforcing the law and they wanted to punish Joe Arpaio because they wanted to a barter so what king says there's basically true that people you know ascribe qualities to these guys according to their belief system so if you believe in strong borders then you were going to think that or payos of that a good guy if you believe in open borders like flake and McCain you're gonna believe he's a bad guy here's what I think I think I believe in in strong borders very much I still think he's a bad guy I think he beat people up I think people were mistreated in his prisons I think once a guy is in prison he is under control and you have no right to make his life hell even if you hate him dressing people up humiliating them you know it's like that's I don't want to say it's unamerican I think it's inhuman I think it's wrong you know I don't think that we have to celebrate that even as we fight for strong borders the problem is however the policy of the federal government toward our borders under Obama and even under george w bush was insane it was insane you cannot have open borders or if you're gonna have open borders make it a law we have no borders our borders are open anyone can come in you cannot say that it's illegal to come across our borders but if you do it welcome you know that that's that's nuts and the thing about this is this has never been a big issue for me I was never the guy who stood up and cheered when he said I'm gonna build him with Trump so I'm gonna build a wall it's not the point he said oh it's a rule of law question once the rule of law collapses once the federal government says oh we we're not obeying the law we're not going to enforce the law then a guy like our payout naturally becomes a hero you know you think back remember Joe the Plumber Obama candidate Obama is out there and Joe the Plumber says what's with this you know spread the wealth socialism stuff basically and Obama embarrassed himself by revealing that in fact he was a socialist he was a proto socialist and the press went after the guy who ask the question it was insane it was horrible it was just an abuse of the power of the press it's why the press has no credibility is why we hate them it's why watching Trump beat them up in Phoenix the other day was such a pleasure it's because they stink that badly that doesn't make Joe the Plumber a wise man that doesn't make him worth hiring to do commentary he was just a guy you know he had the right to say what he said I'm not saying he's a bad guy or a good guy I'm just saying to make him into some kind of icon because the press mistreated him is is what we're always doing were always reacting were always saying oh if they hate him he must be great or if he agrees with us he must be great it's entirely possible for people to agree with us you know and for us to say like it's nuts not to enforce the border that's what a country is a country is its border and for the guy who enforces them to still be a bad guy I okay you know I'm gonna break I'm gonna talk about the Sebastian gorko was the other big story cuz he left the administration these things are just getting blown away by the hurricane but we'll talk about him in a minute but first I have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube and let me say before you go to those of you who do subscribe to The Daily wire

the sword in the stone and we give you the leftist tears down below so please subscribe if you're not doing it if you want to hear the rest of the show come on over to the daily wire.com all right so Sebastian Gorka you know obviously Sebastian Gorky was on our show and he is a friend of the show he's a fan of the show and he's contacted me a couple of times and so one of the things that happened was gorko was absolutely lynched as a pro-nazi because he wore a ribbon from a he's you know he's of Hungarian descent and he wore a medal from what was called the Vitesse ear end and everybody said oh this is a pro-nazi organization well what it was was a Hungarian during before the war in World War two and during the war it was a Hungarian military order of people being celebrated for their service to the country once the Germans you know all this stuff about blaming all the other countries of course there were anti-semites throughout Europe but the death the Holocaust followed the Germans the Holocaust followed the Germans there's a book called the war against the Jews that this describes in very very close recorded terms the data showing that where the Germans went that's where the Jews were persecuted they started calling Gorka a proven anti-semite and Nazi and all the sins because he was a fan of the show and because he was you know occasionally saying a good word to me on Facebook I thought I better figure out who this guy is and do some research because I don't want to be friendly to a Nazi it's total bunk it's complete garbage Gorka at one point said I dare anybody anybody to find a single anti-semitic sentence I've ever written no one has ever found it the reason is his father was in that order his father was anti-nazi fought the Nazis and then was tortured by the Communists and sometimes as he engages in this fight which for him a lot of it is about radical Islamist extremism and trying to stop these people from killing people the same kind of these guys are the same kind of tyrants as the Communists and the same kind of tyrants as the Nazis and in his fight against them he honors his father by wearing that metal and they tagged him for it it was just a lynching but he says that the that his it's very unclear whether he was forced out of resigned he says he resigned I believe him you know but but there may have been a sort of in also that John Kelly the chief of staff pulled his security clearance and that he may just have said well you know you can't fire me I quit basically so it may have been something in between but he says this is the Mogga camp the make America great camp with it was represented and led by Steve ban and being forced out and there is some talk that Sebastian is gonna go over to Breitbart media which Bannon is now running again and he says that that mega mega policy is on the ropes in the White House he said I'm gonna fix the economy build the wall and defeat Isis that's that's Magga that's what making America great again really means and unfortunately I don't want to go into the you know palace intrigue stuff and had too much of that but the fact is the forces of Magha that make America great again faces the policy people like Steve Bannon my old boss inside the White House have been systematically undermined many of them fired from the NSC and I realize after the President's speech this week on Afghanistan that the be is not being well served that speech was written by people for the president in direct contravention of everything that we voted for November the 8th it is not clear why were in Afghanistan it doesn't explain why we're going to continue to potentially expand American lives and and American money in that nation and the most important thing that it didn't mention once once the phrase radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism so divisions at every level divisions in the administration itself this is now going to become the Breitbart sites are now going to become a you know kind of front for that for that agenda that they wanted to push that they feel has been pushed out of the administration there's divisions between Trump and you know and the legislature of the GOP legislators divisions obviously between left and right all the stuff that happening in the midst of what is essentially prosperity peace and prosperity so it's really it really is a spiritual problem and I've said this before I believe that Barack Obama and Donald Trump are the end of something you know Jeremy boring who is the god king of The Daily wire gave a speech recently we have to call him the god-king because he gets upset if we don't you know ugly gets ugly but he gave a speech recently in in Houston I think it was it was in Texas somewhere maybe Dallas anyway he gave a speech and he said that what really happened was the baby boomers finally released their grip on power and allowed essentially the child of baby boomers Barack Obama to take power and they realized the baby boomers that they had done a bad job raising their children Obama had never earned anything he'd never learned anything he thought he knew stuff but all he knew was left-wing palaver and he thought it was true and he didn't know what he didn't know and so we've seized the baby boomers have seized it back with Trump and Hillary basically saying no no we've raised these terrible children but eventually we're gonna have to let go and what's happening now is we're at the end of something that as I've said before the gravity has gone from the room the furniture is floating around everywhere and nobody knows where it's gonna land and that is causing all these fights even in the midst of prosperity let's bring in Knowles low to talk about Berkley because this is really something else Knowles what a Clavin last weekend that was was brutal was it not Michael rolls the host of the Michael Noel's show which had a Spencer Clavin no relation when he's related to Richard Spencer at least he says there's no relation I value and also we re you and I are working around the clock to cure the Clavin this weekend this has been requested for years now and I think we've got it we'll finally I think have the way to avoid the pitfalls and catastrophes of the Clavin last weekend we have had a breakthrough we are recording a podcast of my new novel another Kingdom and you are before I wrote it you're performing it you play this kind of Hollywood guy right well that's the story of my life it's this failed Hollywood guy thank you you know can't catch a break and you know ever since my blank book I think this is the last role I'll ever get in Hollywood so we really got to make this one count it's this is an important role for you this is but but you're actually I mean I I hate to say this on-air band if if anyone repeats it I'll kill them but you are actually very fine actor I've I've seen I've seen you play check off and you're doing a great job on this and basically this guy is a nobody and one day he walks through a door and finds himself in it not only in another Kingdom this kind of fantasy Kingdom filled with ogres and ghouls and all this but he's also accused of murder he's accused he finds himself on trial for murder he there it's a world with ogres and rat-faced ladies and British accents and kings and queens and and he's also this schlub from Hollywood you know so in this other world when he goes through the other portal he's just a reader at a studio in Hollywood and the question and I can really attest to the seriousness of this question living here is which world is more surreal which were through he's coming back to Hollywood really coming back to reality alright let's talk about Berkeley I mean this is was there a well what exactly tell it what what happened over the weekend so there were two these are being conflated but there were two marches and protests that had been planned by right-wingers there one on Saturday in San Francisco was called Patriot Prayer you may go that's very threatening okay yeah but you might as well call it like the Girl Scout bake sale protest as unobjectionable as you can get and then the other event at Berkeley that on Sunday should have been as unobjectionable and it said no Marxism in America no to Marxism in America now in Tifa the anti-fascists that have been around since the 80s and they're ironically anti-fascists because they themselves are fascists right yeah they sent death threats I mean they sent these very violent threats to the organizers to everybody in the neighborhood to the police and so not only on Saturday did the right-wingers cancel their event but on Sunday too so there was officially no right-wing protest okay so either Saturday or Sunday nothing was there only left wingers in this party that's right and now some straggly nobody showed up on Saturday and nevertheless there were big left-wing organizers there but it didn't turn that violent Sunday in Berkeley they were not so lucky there were a handful of right-wingers who showed up even knowing the event was canceled they just wanted to engage the counter protesters see what was going on and so the head of the sad they protest the patriot prayer Joey Gibson found himself surrounded by these guys pepper sprayed immediately he actually had to run to the cops something those cops finally protected him there this is what these guys were chanting I think we have it on clip 13 no mall no USA at all at least these guys are honest yeah that's really that's true they're right out there the mainstream Democrats they've kind of gussy it up in nice language when they want to erase the USA but these guys are very straightforward and so the question was where were the cops where were the cops here and we know in Charlottesville there were reports that the cops stood down that they didn't do as much as they could have here they admitted to it the head of the Berkeley police Andrew Greenwood said that they police made a strategic decision to allow the anarchists to enter the park what was the strategy well the strategy was that they would beat up all the right wingers are the Berkeley police cowards or collaborators and then that's a real question clearly there's an order coming from somewhere it's at least coming from the police chief and the question is where else is it coming from we know the politics of Berkeley we know the people who run that town so there's a real question where is the desire not to shut these criminals and thugs down coming from and by the way the real miracle over the weekend is is that the mainstream media came around and realized maybe it's not the best idea to have these guys in our camp well they have been very you know I mean this really bothers me because if a guy in a white hood white sheet burns a cross on a lawn and says I'm for equality do we believe him no why because he's wearing a white sheet and burning a cross on the lawn a guy in a black mask beats up somebody he disagrees with and says I'm against fascism do we believe him no because he's wearing a black mask and beats people up but the press has basically fallen for the guy they're literally black shirts right yeah that's right and so but shockingly yeah fine by the way ante foe has been around for a long time they've been creating trouble very prominently for years now okay and Washington Post ran a headline today black-clad and Tifa members attack peaceful right-wing demonstrators in Berkeley Wow that's in waffle I think it's a sign of the Apocalypse the rapture a three-headed calf was also New York Magazine had the headline and Tifa beats up Trump supporters comma fuels right-wingers so they can look at their little jab in there but they're being really honest and they're explaining in their headline why they're upset that aunty Fay is beating up Trump supporters because it because it's not that they're doing something wrong it's that they might energize the right that's exactly right and the New York Times engaged I mean the New York Times which you had lightly call a former newspaper engaged in some of its finest fake news this weekend they they said in an article about a antifa quote an Tifa is the backlash to the backlash a defensive unbelievable a defensive response to the growing presence of right-wing extremism and tief has been around in the United States since the 80s they've been organizing under that name since the 90s but they've been beating up Trump supporters and right-wingers very publicly for years never but two years now they then go on in the article see no Trump got in trouble because he said there is their bad foot people on both sides we should condemn both sides he was excoriated for this particularly by the New York Times and then in their article they say so far there is a fearful symmetry between the far right and the antifa so they just mimic did you say the same thing yeah man I mean and look these are they're all the same people you know everybody keeps writing to me and saying it's not fair to call the white supremacist right-wingers which I agree with because of the people I know I mean everybody who believes that racism is is an a bad like you should not treat people according to their race every person who believes that is on the right right there there there are no people on the Left ISM is racism leftism is identity politics it's racism it basically lumps people together according to race so all the non races are on the right but but they identify as right they say they're right and they voted for Trump so I mean I think we have to like at least take an extra moment to kick him down the stairs to make sure we're kicking them out they don't get up they don't get out of the house I agree entirely and they clearly they identify as right I suppose we have to take them at their word for what it's worth right but it's worth remembering to these people obviously share left-wing premises the I with the white identity that racial identity politics but they are an aberration on the right they are clearly a break from the mainstream of right-wing thought and everyone focuses on the violence that neo-nazi killed that woman in Charlottesville and ran over nineteen more right and the these lefties these anti feh are macing people they're beating them up they're sending them to the hospital but forget the violence the violence is almost secondary what's worth pointing out here is that an Tifa is the logical conclusion of mainstream left-wing thought that's I agree with that I think that's a suppression of speech it's the suppression of free ideas and and the intimidation by coercion it's Google basically and that's exactly right right right down the street from Berkeley yeah you know Google with it and within the last three days has launched the crackdown on right-wing right-wingers on YouTube is this is a real thing is a real thing happening they I met with them about two months ago I went out there was me Crowder some Breitbart guys of Heritage Foundation a lot of right-wingers went to this meeting and they told us to her face that this would happen the way that they described it was that there were videos of Isis on YouTube and so they wanted to stop it as a recruiting tool and they were gonna work with groups to redirect people from those videos we now know they're working with the ADL they're working with the Southern Poverty Law solutely hack filled left-wing organization in in activism and they are going to redirect people so you search for a video let's say you search for I don't know the Michael Nolt show for instance or some daily wire video and they theoretically could redirect you to a left-wing video that would debunk the claims made in the extremists really so they wait so you you will search for one thing but they will give you what they want you to know and and the question so Willie so they're gonna make it very damn a dit difficult to find right-wing video yeah but can't walk or Google's general counsel said that what they're going to do is try to get rid of quote inflammatory religious or supremacist content now the question is what's the religion what's the content if we win by supremacism so for videos that meet that criteria and they are those criteria rather they won't be able to run ads or have comments posted they won't appear in the recommended lists that come up on the side when you watch a YouTube video and kind of leads you down a YouTube rabbit hole there will be a warning screen that appears before the video plays and you won't be able to play the video in embedded web sites so if the video is embedded on anywhere else on Twitter or on your own website you won't be able to play it now which religion which supremacist content are we talking about all you need to know is the Dennis Prager video series on the 10 commandments has been restricted by YouTube that is amazing that is I mean Jeff Sessions should respond to this with a an anti-monopoly so they should really go really I'm so hesitant to use the force of the government that way yeah but there there isn't any other YouTube and clearly that's right they've gone to war with conservatives here I mean these guys at this level at this level this is not business this is a business with the power of government I mean there is nothing wrong but there's never anything wrong the whole point of government is to stop the mighty from hurting the small you know that's the whole that's the whole role that's all they have to do if they can just do that and defend the country which is the same thing they've done their job and I think Google is way way out of line and I wish anybody could be hearing this right now because that's right now when you search for me you'll get my mother alright Michael Knowles the host of the excellent Michael Knowles show and our new podcast coming in September I hope another Kingdom another Kingdom hi it's good to see Mike ceedric all right it's time for our crappy culture this is my favorite part of these things you know I don't even want anxious I just like that I just like the graphics you know so you know talking about the the racial divisions in our country and how many of them are real and how many of them are just stuff that the you know that the news media chins up and and why the news media turns up we're gonna talk about that Chanelle helm who is the organizer one of the big organizers of black lives matter in Kentucky has issued on Facebook a decree of what she wants white people to do what she thinks 10 demands that she has of white people I'm just I'm not gonna read them all but I think that this is it really speaks to something in the in the black lives matter movement and in black culture you know let me let me start this before I get to this I've been watching kind of bit by bit this Showtime video I show time documentary on Whitney Houston the reason I'm watching this is because when Whitney Houston appeared in the scene back in the 80s I had never seen a woman so beautiful I mean I thought that she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen she must have been like 19 20 years old and I was much younger and I and I and she had this incredible instrument of a voice I never liked her music much it was very pop for me but she was just unbelievable and I remember standing in a gym in a hotel in Atlanta and watching her on try on some kind of court case where her boyfriend her husband had beaten her up yet again and she was obviously a drugged-out very you know very damaged person and I just remember thinking like what does it take to make people happy I mean here she is beautiful she has a talent that came right from God you know just to delivered right from God she had all the success in the world she broke every record every you know she had that that hit movie The Bodyguard and still is a miserable person who basically ended up killing herself with drugs and I was watching this documentary and some of these people were blaming it on the fact that they tried to make her white when she was black and she got her feelings were hurt because she felt the black community rejected her and I just just think well first of all all of that is garbage once you start taking drugs you're dead I mean that's that's basically it she was taking drugs when she arrived on the music scene once you're in the music scene the drugs will kill you you know so she was already on that but I was just thinking about this I was thinking like you know does she have just because she comes from Newark does she have to sing soul music I mean is that the way is that the way it is now I mean is it like basically you can't have a personality that appeals to a wider audience and all this stuff and this division that is you know so much of this seems to us white people now to be generated from the black community so here is Chanelle helm of the black lives matter her demands white people if you don't have any descendants will your property to a black or brown family preferably one that lives in generational poverty to white people if you're inheriting property you intend to sell upon acceptance give it to a black or brown family you're bound to make that money in some other white privileged way cuz you know it's just just people throw money at me walking down the street they say white man take my money you're white man white people if you can afford to downsize give up the home you own to a black or brown family preferably a family from generational poverty white here's my favorite one white people especially white women because this is your specialty nosy Jenny and meddling Kathy get a racist fired you all know what what the f they be saying you are complicit when you ignore them get your boss fired because they races to on and on and on just the all these what it racial slurs their racial slurs I mean that's what that is that's it's a racial slur that you know that people are racist just and and we sit there and we say well you know I'm not bothering you I don't feel that way I was hot you know we tire right we would like you it you know and all this stuff that how can we react to this and all that racism that you were fighting in the past is gone Shelby Steele one of the most brilliant men in the country and that guy who just doesn't write enough as far as I'm concerned every now and again he has a piece in The Wall Street Journal he wrote a piece saying will the left ever let go of this stuff and he says he pipiens is America racist it used to be that racism meant the actual enforcement of bigotry the routine implementation of racial inequality everywhere in public and private life racism was a tyranny and an oppression that dehumanized Animalize the other it was a social malignancy and it carried the authority of natural laws if God himself had dispassionately ordained it today Americans know that active racism is no longer the greatest barrier to black and minority advancement since the 1960s other pathologies even if originally generated by racism have supplanted it white racism did not shoot more than four thousand people last year in Chicago to the contrary America for decades now with much genuine remorse has been recoiling from the practice of racism and has gained a firm intolerance for what it wants indulged but he goes on to say America this is Shelby Steele one of the really top thinkers in the country but Americans don't really trust the truth of this it sounds to self exonerating talk of structural and systemic racism conditions people to think of it as inexorable predestined so we want Redemption he says because we don't trust that America has been cleansed of the sin we want redemption he says redemption paying off the nation's sins became the moral imperative of a new political and cultural liberalism and that's what this woman is talking about give up your property I mean you work so hard all of us we work so hard to have our family in a nice house to give our kids good schooling to give him a chance in life and she wants us to turn around and give this up because you know boohoo you know if something something something something you know and what he says what Shelby Steele says is she essentially and the left are selling innocence they're telling you that they will redeem your sin if you agree with them America's Mara moral fall in the 60s made innocence of the past and obsession thus liberalism invited people to internalize innocence to become synonymous with it even to fight for it as they would for an ideology but to be innocent there must be an evil from which to be free the liberal identity must have racism listed lose innocence and the power it conveys the great problem for conservatives is that they lack the moral glibness to compete with liberalism's innocence but today there are signs of what I have called race fatigue people are becoming openly cynical toward the Left moral muscling with racism add to this liberalism's monumental failure to come even close to realizing any of its beautiful ideals as idealisms was the left political left political edge realism shouldn't realism be the Wrights reality is the vision and no more wrestling with innocence let me just end by playing this one piece that King was on NPR this is a guy named William Weaver who is now the Chief of Surgery at a facility in North Carolina William Weaver if you can't see him he's a black guy and he went was sent to school in Tennessee as a sophomore to integrate this school he was one of the first black kids into this school listen to his story you know he's now an older man listen to the story of what it was like to integrate a school in Tennessee as soon as we got into the school the principal was calling the roll he said Bill Weaver and I said my name is William and he said oh you're a smart in word I've been in school maybe 30 minutes and he suspended me I don't remember a day that a teacher did not tell me that I didn't belong we'd have a test and they'd stand over me and then to snatch the paper after - at times up the first report card I got all FS including phys ed so I've gone from being a good student to starting to think well maybe I don't belong maybe I am done so so think about this in real terms for just a minute this is he's a sophomore so he's 15 years old it's a 15 year old child in a school the teacher calling him the n-word teachers standing over him snatching his you know what is that it's psychosis it's madness that's something that is psychopathology but it doesn't look like psychopathology it doesn't look like the guy's psycho because he's living in a racist society he's living in a society where it made sense to a grown-up a teacher to call a fifteen-year-old those names and try to prevent him from gaining an education that made sense to those people because they were living in a psycho society just like these people who are teaching their children to be transgender or living in a psychopathology that surrounds them and so they are being psycho the thing about this kind of thing we saw this in the generation of Jews after the Holocaust is it creates trauma it traumatizes people and it can traumatize an entire people just like psychosis can make an entire group of people psychotic I mean you go to Brooklyn New York now and talk to people about transgenderism they say words come out of their mouths that are nuts you know and the same thing was true about these in this school where all these teachers were trying to prevent this child from getting the education that turned him into a dr. evil the way evil works is it turns its victims into itself child abusers children who are abused innocent children who are abused grow up oftentimes and become child abusers let me put that in a more exact way most child abusers were once abused children let's put it that way because not all abused children become child abusers but almost all child abusers were once abused children evil turns its victims into itself what we're dealing with in this country is trauma and when they left always says to us we need a conversation about race what they mean is they're going to browbeat us and tell us that we all have to be leftist in order to solve these problems which is nonsense but what the real conversation should be is how do you get over trauma we had a trauma I get it it's a real thing we had a trauma giving people property is not gonna get make that go away giving people money is not gonna go away people who were traumatized repeat the trauma over and over again that is what happens to people who are traumatized if you were traumatized by a mean mother you're gonna go out and find mean women if you were traumatized by an abusive father you're gonna go out and find abusive men people who are traumatized do the same thing over and over again and that's the conversation about race we should be happening having in our crappy culture can we see the crappy culture thing all right but remember please with all the trauma with all the stuff that's in the news the stuff that doesn't get in the news is that people are out there helping each other in Texas and everywhere else everywhere else where there are police officers black police officers protecting white you know supremacist protesters wear their white bullet police officers protecting black lives matter this is happening all the time these are the majority of the people and these that is the people that we are both on the left and the right remember you know doing these things that are the good things that keep the world running every day and we need to remember it because they are selling us hatred of one another and when guys like Jim Mathis matter sir there and those troops are out there defending us he's right we owe it to one another to remember that we are not enemies but friends I'm Andrew Clavin this is the end reclaimer show we have Steve Crowder coming on all right that should be that should be interesting get to pad the room please we'll pad the room so he doesn't hurt himself and we'll see you then be here too Peter
