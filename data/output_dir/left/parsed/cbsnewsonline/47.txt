ADDRESS THE ASSEMBLY.
YOU HAVE THE FLOOR, SIR.
>> MADAM PRESIDENT, MR.
SECRETARY GENERAL, WORLD
LEADERS, AMBASSADORS, AND
EXTINGUISHED DELEGATES.
ONE YEAR AGO I STOOD BEFORE YOU
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS GRAND
HALL.
I ADDRESSED THE THREATS FACING
OUR WORLD AND I PRESENTED A
VISION TO ACHIEVE A BRIGHTER
FUTURE FOR ALL OF HUMANITY.
TODAY I STAND BEFORE THE UNITED
NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO
SHARE THE EXTRA ORDINARY
PROGRESS WE'VE MADE.
IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS MY
ADMINISTRATION HAS ACCOMPLISHED
MORE THAN ALMOST ANY
ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF
OUR COUNTRY.
AMERICA'S SO TRUE.
DIDN'T EXPECT THAT REACTION, BUT
THAT'S OKAY.
AMERICA'S ECONOMY IS BOOMING
LIKE NEVER BEFORE.
SINCE MY ELECTION, WE'VE ADDED
$10 MILLION IN WEALTH.
THE STOCK MARKET IS AT AN
ALL-TIME HIGH IN HISTORY AND
JOBLESS CLAIMS ARE AT A 50-YEAR
LOW.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN,
HISPANIC-AMERICAN, AND OTHERS
HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR LOWEST
LEVELS RECORDED.
WE'VE ADDED FOUR MILLION NEW
JOBS, INCLUDING HALF A MILLION
MANUFACTURING JOBS.
WE HAVE PASSED THE BIGGEST TAX
CUTS AND REFORMS IN AMERICAN
HISTORY.
WE'VE STARTED THE CONSTRUCTION
OF A MAJOR BORDER WALL AND WE
HAVE GREAT STRENGTHENED BORDER
SECURITY.
WE HAVE SECURED RECORD FUNDING
FOR OUR MILITARY.
$700 BILLION THIS YEAR, AND
$716 BILLION NEXT YEAR.
OUR MILITARY WILL SOON BE MORE
POWERFUL THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN
BEFORE.
IN OTHER WORDS, THE UNITED
STATES IS STRONGER, SAFER, AND A
RICHER COUNTRY THAN IT WAS WHEN
I ASSUMED OFFICE LESS THAN TWO
YEARS ALTHOUGH.
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR AMERICA,
AND FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND
WE ARE ALSO STANDING UP FOR THE
WORLD.
THIS IS GREAT NEWS FOR OUR
CITIZENS.
AND FOR PEACE-LOVING PEOPLE
EVERYWHERE.
WE BELIEVE WHEN NATIONS RESPECT
THE RIGHTS OF THEIR NEIGHBORS
AND DEFEND THE INTEREST OF THEIR
PEOPLE, THEY CAN BETTER WORK
TOGETHER TO SECURE THE BLESSINGS
SAFETY, PROSPERITY AND PEACE.
EACH OF US HERE TODAY IS THE
ADVERSARY OF A RICH CULTURE, AND
PEOPLE BOUND TOGETHER BY TIES OF
MEMORY, TRADITION, AND THE
VALUES THAT MAKE OUR HOMELANDS
LIKE NOWHERE ELSE ON EARTH.
THAT IS WHY AMERICA WILL ALWAYS
CHOOSE INDEPENDENCE OVER GLOBAL
GOVERNANCE.
I HONOR EVERY NATION TO PURSUE
ITS OWN CUSTOMS, BELIEFS AND
TRADITIONS.
THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT TELL
YOU HOW TO LIVE OR WORK OR
WORSHIP.
WE ONLY ASK THAT YOU HONOR OUR
SOVEREIGNTY IN RETURN, FROM
WARSAW, TO BRUSSELS, TO TOKYO,
TO SINGAPORE, IT HAS BEEN MY
HIGHEST HONOR TO REPRESENT THE
UNITED STATES ABROAD.
I HAVE FORGED CLOSE
RELATIONSHIPS AND FRIENDSHIPS
AND STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE
LEADERS OF MANY NATIONS IN THIS
ROOM AND OUR APPROACH HAS ALWAYS
YIELDED INCREDIBLE CHANGE.
WE SUPPORT MANY COUNTRIES TODAY
AND HAVE ENGAGED IN W NORTH
KOREA TO REPLACE THE INSPECTOR
OF CONTICKET WITH A BOLD AND NEW
PUSH FOR PEACE.
IN JUNE I TRAVELED TO SINGAPORE
TO MEET FACE-TO-FACE WITH NORTH
KOREA'S LEADER, KIM JONG-UN.
WE HAD HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE
CONVERSATIONS AND MEETINGS.
AND WE AGREED THAT IT WAS IN
BOTH COUNTRIES' INTEREST TO
PURSUE THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF
THE KOREAN PENINSULA.
SINCE THAT MEETING WE'VE ALREADY
SEEN A NUMBER OF ENCOURAGING
MEASURES THAT FEW COULD HAVE
IMAGINED ONLY A SHORT TIME AGO.
THE MISSILES AND BEING ROETS ARE
NO LONGER FLYING IN EVERY
DIRECTION.
NUCLEAR TESTING HAS STOPPED,
SOME MILITARY FACILITIES ARE
ALREADY BEING DISMANTLED.
OUR HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN RELEASED
AND AS PROMISED, THE REMAINS OF
OUR FALLEN REROWS ARE BEING
RETURNED HOME, TO LAY AT REST IN
AMERICAN SOIL.
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK CHAIRMAN
KIM FOR HIS COURAGE AND THE
STEPS HE'S TAKEN.
THOUGH MUCH WORK NEEDS TO BE
DONE.
THE SANCTIONS WILL STAY IN PLACE
UNTIL THE DENUCLEARIZATION
OCCURS.
I WANT TO HELP THOSE WHO HAVE
REACHED US REACH THIS MOMENT, A
MOMENT THAT IS FAR GREATER THAN
PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND.
FAR GREATER.
BUT FOR ALSO THEIR SUPPORT AND
THE CRITICAL SUPPORT THAT WE
WILL ALL NEED GOING FORWARD.
SPECIAL THANKS TO PRESIDENT MOON
OF SOUTH KOREA, PRIME MINISTER
ABE OF JAPAN, AND PRESIDENT XI
OF CHINA.
IN THE MIDDLE EAST OUR NEW
APPROACH IS YIELDING GREAT
STRIDES AND VERY HISTORIC
CHANGE.
FOLLOW BE MY TRIP TO SAUDI
ARABIA LAST YEAR, THE GULF
COUNTRIES OPENED A NEW CENTER TO
TARGET TERRORISTS FINANCING.
SAY THAT ARE ENFORCING NEW
SANCTIONS WORKING WITH US TO
IDENTIFY AND TRACK TERRORIST
NETWORKS AND TAKING MORE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR FIGHTING
TERRORISM AND EXTREMISM IN THEIR
OWN REGION.
THE UAE, SAUDI ARABIA, AND QATAR
HAVE PLEDGED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
TO AID THE PEOPLE OF SYRIA AND
YEMEN.
AND THEY ARE PURSUING MULTIPLE
AVENUES TO ENDING YEMEN'S
HORRIBLE, HORRIFIC CIVIL WAR.
ULTIMATELY, IT IS UP TO THE
NATIONS OF THE REGION TO DECIDE
WHAT KIND OF FUTURE THEY WANT
FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR
CHILDREN.
FOR THAT REASON THE UNITED
STATES IS WORKING WITH THE GULF
CORPORATION COUNCIL, JORDAN AND
EGYPT TO ESTABLISH A REGIONAL
STRATEGIC ALLIANCE SO MIDDLE
EASTERN NATIONS CAN ADVANCE
STABILITY AND SECURITY ACROSS
THEIR HOME REJION.
THANK YOU TO THE UNITED STATES
MILITARY AND OUR PARTNERSHIP
WITH MANY OF YOUR NATIONS, I AM
PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THE BLOOD
THIRSTY KILLERS KNOWN AS ISIS
HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OUT FROM THE
TERRITORY THEY ONCE HELD IN IRAQ
AND SYRIA.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH
FRIENDS AND ALLIES TO DENY
RADICAL ISLAMIC TERARISTS,
FUNDING, TERRITORY OR SUPPORT OR
ANY MEANS OF INFILTRATING OUR
BORDERS.
THE ONGOING TRAGEDY IN SYRIA IS
HEARTBREAKING.
OUR SHARED GOALS MUST BE THE
DEESCALATION OF MILITARY
CONFLICT, ALONG WITH A POLITICAL
SOLUTION THAT HONORS THE WILL OF
THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.
IN THIS VAIN, WE URGE THE UNITED
NATIONS LED PEACE PROCESS BE
REINVIGORATED BUT REV ASSURED
THE UNITED STATES WILL
RESPOND -- REST ASSURED THE
UNITED STATES WILL RESPOND IF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE DEPLOYED BY
THE BASHAR AL-ASSAD REGIME.
I COMMAND OTHER COUNTRIES FOR
HOSTING REFUGEES FROM THIS VERY
BRUTAL CIVIL WAR.
AS WE SEE IN JORDAN, THE MOST
COMPASSIONATE POLICY IS TO PLACE
REFUGEES AS CLOSE TO THEIR HOMES
AS POSSIBLE, TO EASE THEIR
EVENTUAL RETURN TO BE PART OF
THE REBUILDING PROCESS.
THIS APPROACH ALSO STRETCHES
FINITE RESOURCES TO HELP FAR
MORE PEOPLE INCREASING THE
IMPACT OF EVERY DOLLAR SPENT.
EVERY SOLUTION TO THE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN SYRIA
MUST INCLUDE A STRATEGY TO
ADDRESS THE BRUTAL REGIME THAT
IS FUELED AND FINANCED IT.
THE CORRUPT DICTATORSHIP IN
IRAN.
IRAN'S LEADERS SAW CHAOS, DEATH,
AND DESTRUCTION.
THEY DO NOT RESPECT THEIR
NEIGHBORS OR BORDERS OR THE
SOVEREIGN RIGHTS OF NATIONS.
INSTEAD, IRAN'S LEADERS
PLUNDERED THE NATION'S RESOURES
TO ENRICH THEMSELVES AND TO
SPREAD MAYHEM ACROSS THE MIDDLE
EAST AND FAR BEYOND.
THE IRANIAN PEOPLE ARE RIGHTLY
OUTRAGED THEIR LEADERS EMBEZZLED
BILLIONS FROM IRAN'S TREASURE,
SEIZED VALUE PORTIONS OF THE
INCOME AND LOOTED THE PEOPLE'S
RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTES ALL TO
WAGE WAR ON THEIR PROXIES.
NOT GOOD.
IRAN'S NEIGHBORS HAVE PAID A
HEAVY TOLL FOR THE REGION'S
AGENDA OF AGGRESSION AND
EXPANSION.
THAT IS WHY SO MANY COUNTRIES IN
THE MIDDLE EAST STRONGLY
SUPPORTED MY DECISION TO
WITHDRAW UNITED STATES FROM THE
HORRIBLE 2015 IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL
AND REIMPOSE NUCLEAR SANCTIONS.
THE IRAN DEAL WAS A WIN FALL FOR
IRAN'S LEADERS.
IN THE YEARS SINCE THE DEAL WAS
REACHED, IRAN'S MILITARY BUDGET
GREW NEARLY 40%.
THE DICTATOR FUNDS USED TO BUILD
MISSILES, INCREASE INTERNAL
REPRESSION, FINANCE TERRORISM
AND FUND HAVOC AND SLAUGHTER IN
SYRIA AND YEMEN.
THE UNITED STATES HAS LAUNCHED A
CAMPAIGN OF ECONOMIC OPPRESSION
TO REMY THE FUNDS NEEDS TO
ADVANCE ITS BLOODY AGENDA.
LAST MONTH WE BEGAN REIMPOSING
HARD-HITTING NUCLEAR SANCTIONS
THAT HAVE BEEN LIFTED UNDER THE
IRAN DEAL.
ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS WILL RESUME
NOVEMBER 5th AND MORE WILL
FOLLOW AND WE ARE WORKING WITH
COUNTRIES THAT IMPORT IRANIAN
CRUDE OIL TO CUT THEIR PURCHASES
SUBSTANTIALLY.
WE CANNOT ALLOW THE WORLD'S
LEADING SPONSOR OF TERRORISM TO
POSSESS THE PLANET'S MOST
DANGEROUS WEAPONS.
WE CANNOT ALLOW A REGIME THE
CHANCED UP TO AMERICA AND THAT
THREATENED ISRAEL WITH
ANNIHILATION, TO POSSESS THE
MEANS TO DELIVER A NUCLEAR
WARHEAD TO ANY CITY ON EARTH,
JUST CAN'T DO IT.
WE ASK ALL NATIONS TO ISOLATE
IRAN'S REGIME AS LONGER AS ITS
AGGRESSION CONTINUES AND WE ASK
ALL NATIONS TO SUPPORT IRAN'S
PEOPLE AS THEY STRUGGLE TO
RECLAIM, THEIR RELIGIOUS AND
RIGHTEOUS DESTINY.
.
YEAR, WE ALSO TOOK ANOTHER
SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD IN THE
MIDDLE EAST IN RECOGNITION OF
EVERY SOVEREIGN STATE TO
DETERMINE ITS OWN CAPITAL, I
MOVED THE U.S. EMBASSY IN ISRAEL
TO JERUSALEM.
THE UNITED STATES HAS COMMITTED
TO A FUTURE OF PEACE AND
CIVILITY IN THE REGION,
INCLUDING PEACE BETWEEN THE
ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS.
THAT AIM IS ADVANCED NOT HARMED
BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE OBVIOUS
FACTS.
AMERICA'S POLICY OF PRINCIPLE TO
REALISM MUST MEAN WE CANNOT BE
HELD HOSTAGE TO IDEOLOGIES, AND
DOG MAS, PROVEN OVER THE YEARS
TIME AND TIME AGAIN.
THIS IS TRUE NOT ONLY IN MATTERS
OF PEACE, BUT IN MATTERS OF
PROSPERITY.
WE BELIEVE THAT TRADE MUST BE
FAIR AND RECIPROCAL.
THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT BE
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF ANY LONGER.
FOR DECADES, THE UNITED STATES
OPENED ITS ECONOMY.
THE LARGEST BY FAR ON EARTH WITH
FEW CONDITIONS.
WE ALLOWED FOREIGN GOODS FROM
ALL OVER THE WORLD TO FLOW
FREELY ACROSS OUR BORDERS, YET
OTHER COUNTRIES DID NOT GRANT US
FAIR AND RECIPROCAL ACCESS TO
THEIR MARKETS IN RETURN.
EVEN WORSE, SOME COUNTRIES
ABUSED THEIR OPENNESS TO DUMP
THEIR PRODUCTS, TARGET OUR
INDUSTRIES, AND MANIPULATE THEIR
CURRENCIES TO GAIN UNFAIR
ADVANTAGE OVER OUR COUNTRY.
AS A RESULT, OUR TRADE DEFICIT
BALLOONED TO NEARLY $800 BILLION
A YEAR.
FOR THIS REASON WE ARE
SYSTEMATICALLY RENEGIATIONING
BROKEN AND BAD TRADE DEALS.
LAST MONTH WE ANNOUNCED A
GROUNDBREAKING U.S.-MEXICO TRADE
AGREEMENT AND JUST YET I STOOD
WITH PRESIDENT MOON TO ANNOUNCE
THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE
BRAND-NEW U.S.-KOREA TRADE DEAL.
AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.
MANY NATIONS IN THIS HALL WILL
AGREE THAT THE WORLD TRADING
SYSTEM IS IN DIRE NEED OF
CHANGE.
FOR EXAMPLE, COUNTRIES WERE
ADMITTED TO THE WORLD TRADE
ORGANIZATION THEY VIOLATE EVERY
SINGLE PRINCIPAL ON WHICH THE
ORGANIZATION IS BASED.
WHILE THE UNITED STATES AND MANY
OTHER NATIONS PLAY BY THE RULES
THESE COUNTRIES USE
GOVERNMENT-RUN INDUSTRIAL
PLANNING AND STATE-OWNED
ENTERPRISES TO RIG THE SYSTEM IN
THEIR FAVOR.
THEY ENGAGE IN RELENTLESS
PRODUCT DUMPING, FORCED
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, AND THE
THEFT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
THE UNITED STATES LOST OVER 3
MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS,
NEARLY A QUARTER OF ALL STEEL
JOBS, AND 60,000 FACTORIES AFTER
CHINA JOINED THE WTO.
AND WE HAVE RACKED UP
$13 TRILLION IN TRADE DEFICITS
OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES.
BUT THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.
WE WILL NO LONGER TOLERATE SUCH
ABUSE.
WE WILL NOT ALLOW OUR WORKERS TO
BE VICTIMIZED, OUR COMPANIES TO
BE CHEATED, AND OUR WEALTH TO BE
PLUNDERED AND TRANSFERRED.
AMERICA WILL NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR
PROTECTING ITS CITIZENS.
THE UNITED STATES HAS JUST
ANNOUNCED TARIFFS ON ANOTHER
$200 BILLION IN CHINESE-MADE
GOODS FOR A TOTAL SO FAR OF
$250 BILLION.
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT AND
AFFECTION FOR MY FRIEND
PRESIDENT XI, BUT OUR TRADE
IMBALANCE, I HAVE MADE CLEAR, IS
JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE.
CHINA'S MARKED DISTORTIONS AND
THE WAY THEY DEAL CANNOT BE
TOLERATED.
AS MY ADMINISTRATION HAS
DEMONSTRATED, AMERICA WILL
ALWAYS ACT IN OUR NATIONAL
INTERESTS.
I SPOKE BEFORE THIS BODY LAST
YEAR AND WARNED THAT THE U.N.
HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL HAD BECOME
A GRAVE EMBARRASSMENT TO THIS
CONSTITUTION, SHIELDING
EGREGIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSERS
WHILE BASHING AMERICA AND ITS
MANY FRIENDS.
OUR AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITE
WOULD NATIONS, NIKKI HALEY, LAID
OUT A CLEAR AGENDA FOR REFORM,
BUT DESPITE REPORTED AND
REPEATED WARNINGS, NO ACTION AT
ALL WAS TAKEN.
SO THE UNITED STATES TOOK THE
ONLY RESPONSIBLE COURSE AND
WITHDREW FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS
COUNCIL AND WE WILL NOT RETURN
UNTIL REAL REFORM IS ENACTED.
FOR SIMILAR REASONS, THE UNITED
STATES WILL PROVIDE NO SUPPORT
IN RECOGNITION TO THE
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT.
AS FAR AS AMERICA IS CONCERNED,
THE ICC HAS NEW JURISDICTION, NO
LEGITIMACY, AND NO AUTHORITY.
THE ICC CLAIMS UNIVERSAL
JURISDICTION OVER THE CITIZENS
OF EVERY COUNTRY VIOLATING
PRINCIPLES OF FAIRNESS, JUSTICE,
AND DUE PROCESS.
WE WILL NEVER SUBDUE AMERICA'S
SOVEREIGNTY TO A GLOBAL
BUREAUCRACY.
AMERICA IS GOVERNED BY
AMERICANS.
WE REJECTED IDEOLOGY OF
GLOBALISM AND EMBRACE THE
DOCTRINE OF PATRIOTISM AROUND
THE WORLD, RESPONSIBLE NATIONS
MUST DEFEND AGAINST THREATS TO
SOVEREIGNTY NOT JUST FROM
DOMINATION.
WE BELIEVE STRONGLY IN ENERGY
SECURITY FOR OURSELVES AND FOR
OUR ALLIES.
WE HAVE BECOME THE LARGEST
ENERGY PRODUCER ANYWHERE ON THE
FACE OF THE EARTH THE UNITED
STATES STANDS READY TO EXPORT
OUR ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF OIL,
CLEAN COAL AND NATURAL GAS.
OPEC AND OPEC NATIONS ARE AS
USUAL RIPPING OFF THE REST OF
THE WORLD AND I
. 
>>> NOT GOOD.    
WE WANT THEM TO STOP RAISING 
PRICES, WE WANT THEM TO START 
LOWERING PRICES AND MUST 
CONTRIBUTE SUBSTANTIALLY TO 
MILITARY PROTECTION FROM NOW 
ON.      
WE'RE NOT GOING TO  PUT UP WITH 
IT    THESE HONORABLE PRICES 
MUCH LONGER.    
RELIANCE ON A SINGLE FOREIGN 
SUPPLIER CAN LEAVE A NATION 
VULNERABLE TO EXTORTION AND 
INTIMIDATION.  
THAT IS WHY WE CONGRATULATE 
EUROPEAN STATES SUCH AS POLAND 
FOR LEADING THE CONSTRUCTION OF 
A PIPELINE SO THAT NATIONS ARE 
NOT DEPENDENT ON RUSSIA TO MEET 
THEIR ENERGY NEEDS.        
IT HAS BEEN THE FORMAL POLICY 
OF OUR COUNTRY SINCE PRESIDENT 
MONROE THAT WE REJECT THE 
INTERFERENCE OF FOREIGN NATIONS 
IN THIS HEMISPHERE AND IN OUR 
OWN AFFAIRS.      
THE UNITED STATES HAS RECENTLY 
STRENGTHEN IT HAD OR LAWS TO 
BETTER SCREEN FOREIGN 
INVESTMENTS,  IN OUR COUNTRY 
FOR NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS.  
AND WE WELCOME COOPERATION  
WITH COUNTRIES IN THIS REGION  
AND AROUND THE WORLD  THAT WISH 
TO DO  THE SAME.     
YOU NEED TO DO IT FOR YOUR OWN 
PROTECTION.       
THE UNITED STATES IS ALSO 
WORKING WITH  PARTNERS IN LATIN 
AMERICA TO CONFRONT THREATS  TO 
-- FROM UNCONTROLLED MIGRATION, 
TOLERANCE FOR HUMAN STRUGGLING, 
AND HUMAN  SMUGGLING  AND 
TRAFFICKING  IS NOT HUMANE.     
IT'S A HONORABLE THING THAT'S 
GOING ON  AT LEVELS THAT NOBODY 
IS EVER  SEEN BEFORE.      
IT'S VERY, VERY CRUEL.      
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION FUNDS 
CRIMINAL NETWORKS, RUTHLESS 
GANG AND THE FLOW OF DEADLY 
DRUGS. 
ILLEGALIMMIGRATION EXPLOITS AS 
A RULE OTHER VALUABLE 
POPULATIONS, HURTS HARD WORKING 
CITIZENS AND HAS PRODUCED A 
VICIOUS CYCLE OF CRIME, 
VIOLENCE AND POINT OF  POVERTY. 
ONLY BY UPHOLDING NATIONAL 
BORDERS, DESTROYING CRIMINAL 
GANGS CAN WE BREAK THIS CYCLE 
AND ESTABLISH A REAL FOUNDATION 
FOR PROSPERITY.     
WE RECOGNIZE  THE RIGHT OF 
EVERY NATION IN THIS ROOM  TO 
SET ITS OWN IMMIGRATION POLICY 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS NATIONAL 
INTERESTS. 
JUST AS WEASK OTHER COUNTRIES 
TO RESPECT OUR OWN RIGHT TO DO 
THE SAME WHICH WE ARE DOING. 
THAT IS ONEREASON THE UNITED 
STATES WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN 
THE NEW GLOBAL COMPACT ON 
MIGRATION.     
MY GRADUATION SHOULD NOT BE 
GOVERNED BY AN INTERNATIONAL 
BODY UNACCOUNTABLE TO OUR OWN 
CITIZENS.      
ULTIMATELY THE ONLY LONG-TERM 
SOLUTION TO THE MIGRATION 
CRISIS  IS TO HELP PEOPLE BUILD 
MORE HOPEFUL FUTURES IN THEIR 
HOME  COUNTRIES.      
MAKE  THEIR COUNTRIES GREAT 
AGAIN.       
CURRENTLY WE ARE WITNESSING A 
HUMAN TRAGEDY  AS AN EXAMPLE, 
IN VENEZUELA, MORE THAN 2 
MILLION PEOPLE HAVE FLED THE 
ANGUISH INFLICTED BY THE 
SOCIALIST REGIME AND ITS CUBAN 
SPONSORS. 
NOT LONG AGO CONVENIENCE WALL 
LAW WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST 
COUNTRIES ON EARTH. 
TODAYSOCIAL LIMIT HAS BANK 
ERUPTED THE OIL RICH NATION AND 
DRIVEN ITS PEOPLE  INTO ABJECT 
POVERTY. 
VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERESOCIAL 
LIMIT OR COMMUNISM HAS BEEN 
TRIED. 
SOCIAL LIMITSTHIRST FOR POWER 
LEADS TO EXPANSION AND 
OPPRESSION.       
ALL NATIONS OF THE WORLD SHOULD 
RESIST SOCIAL I'M AND THE 
MISERY THAT IT BRINGS TO 
EVERYONE. 
IN THATSPIRIT, WE ASK THE 
NATIONS GATHERED HERE TO JOIN 
US IN CALLING FOR THE 
RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN 
VENEZUELA.    
TODAY WE'RE ANNOUNCING 
ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST  
THE REPRESS SIEVE REGIME.    
TARGETING THE INNER CIRCLE AND 
CLOSE ADVISERS. 
WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF THE 
WORK THE UNITED NATIONS DOES 
AROUND THE WORLD TO HELP PEOPLE 
BUILD BETTER LIVES FOR 
THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES.  
THE UNITED STATES IS THE 
WORLD'S LARGEST GIVER IN THE 
WORLD BY FAR,  OF FOREIGN AID.  
BUT FEW GIVE ANYTHING TO US , 
THAT IS WHY WE'RE TAKING A HARD 
LOOK AT U.S. FOREIGN 
ASSISTANCE.      
THAT WILL BE HEADED UP BY THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO. 
WE WILL EXAMINE WHAT IS 
WORKING, WHAT IS NOT WORKING,  
AND WHETHER THE  COUNTRIES  WHO 
RECEIVE OUR DOLLARS  AND OUR 
PROTECTION  ALSO HAVE OUR 
INTERESTS AT HEART.      
MOVING FORWARD,  WE'RE ONLY 
GOING TO GIVE FOREIGN AID TO 
THOSE WHO RESPECT US  AND 
FRANKLY  ARE  OUR FRIENDS.      
AND WE EXPECT  OTHER COUNTRIES  
TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE  FOR  
THE COST OF THEIR DEFENSE.      
THE UNITED STATES IS COMMITTED 
TO MAKING THE UNITED NATIONS 
MORE EFFECTIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE. 
I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES  THAT 
THE UNITE NATIONS HAS ULIMITED 
POTENTIAL  AS PART OF OUR 
REFORM EFFORT I HAVE TOLD  OUR 
NEGOTIATORS THAT THE UNITED 
STATES  WILL NOT PAY  MORE THAN 
25% OF THE UN PEACEKEEPING 
BUDGET. 
THIS WILLENCOURAGE OTHER 
COUNTRIES TO STEP UP, GET 
INVOLVED AND ALSO SHARE IN THIS 
VERY LARGE BURDEN.      
WE ARE WORKING TO SHIFT MORE OF 
OUR FUNDING FROM ASSESSED 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO VOLUNTARILY SO 
THAT WE CAN TARGET AMERICAN 
RESOURCES TO THE PROGRAMS WITH 
THE BEST  RECORD OF SUCCESS.    
ONLY WHEN EACH OF US DOES OUR 
PART,  AND CONTRIBUTES OUR 
SHARE,  CAN WE REALIZE THE UN'S 
HIGHEST  ASPIRATIONS.      
WE MUST PURSUE PEACE WITHOUT 
FEAR,  HOPE WITHOUT DESPAIR AND 
SECURITY WITHOUT APOLOGY.      
LOOKING AROUND THIS HALL WHERE 
SO MUCH HISTORY HAS TRANSPIRED 
WE THINK OF THE MANY BEFORE US  
WHO HAVE COME HERE  TO ADDRESS 
THE CHALLENGES OF THEIR NATIONS 
AND OF THEIR TIMES.     
AND OUR THOUGHTS TURN TO THE 
SAME QUESTION THAT RAN THROUGH 
ALL THEIR SPEECHES AND 
RESOLUTIONS  THROUGH EVERY 
WORD, AND EVERY HOPE. 
IT IS THE QUESTIONOF WHAT KIND 
OF WORLD  WILL WE LEAVE FOR OUR 
CHILDREN? 
ANDWHAT KIND OF NATIONS  THEY 
WILL INHERIT ?  THE DREAMSTHAT 
FILL THIS HAUL TODAY ARE AS 
DIVERSE AS THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
STOOD AT THIS PODIUM  AND AS 
VARIED AS THE COUNTRIES  
REPRESENTED RIGHT HERE  IN THIS 
BODY ARE. 
IT REALLY ISSOMETHING.     
IT REALLY IS GREAT, GREAT 
HISTORY.     
THERE IS INDIA, A FREE SOCIETY 
OVER  A BILLION PEOPLE,  
SUCCESSFULLY LIFTING COUNTLESS 
MILLIONS OUT OF POVERTY AND 
INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS. 
THERE ISSAUDI ARABIA WHERE THE 
KING AND CROWN PRINCE ARE 
PURSUING REFORMS, ISRAEL 
PROUDLY CELEBRATING ITS 70TH 
ANNIVERSARY AS A THRIVING 
DEMOCRACY. 
INPOLAND PEOPLE ARE STANDING UP 
FOR THEIR INDEPENDENCE, THEIR 
SECURITY AND SOFT SEVERE TEE. 
MANY COUNTRIES ARE PURSUING 
THEIR OWN UNIQUE VISIONS 
BUILDING THEIR OWN HOPEFUL 
FUTURES AND CHASING THEIR OWN 
WONDERFUL DREAMS OF DESTINY, 
LEGACY, AND OF  A HOME.     
THE WHOLE WORLD IS RICHER.      
HUMANITY IS BETTER.    
BECAUSE OF THIS BEAUTIFUL  
CONSTELLATION OF NATIONS  EACH 
VERY SPECIAL,  EACH VERY 
UNIQUE, AND EACH  SHINING 
BRIGHTLY  IN ITS PART  OF THE 
WORLD.      
AND EACH ONE WE SEE AWESOME 
PROMISE OF A PEOPLE BOUND 
TOGETHER BY A SHARED PAST  AND 
WORKING TOWARD A COMMON FUTURE. 
AS FOR AMERICANS WE KNOW  WHAT 
KIND OF FUTURE WE WANT FOR 
OURSELVES.      
WE KNOW WHAT KIND OF A NATION  
AMERICA MUST ALWAYS BE.       
IN AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN THE 
MAJORITY OF FREEDOM AND THE 
DIGNITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL. 
WEBELIEVE IN SELF-GOVERNMENT 
AND THE RULE OF LAW.    
AND WE PRIZE THE CULTURE THAT 
SUSTAINS OUR LIBERTY, A CULTURE 
BUILT ON STRONG FAMILIES,  DEEP 
FAITH,  AND FIERCE 
INDEPENDENCE. 
WE CELEBRATE OURHEROES, 
TREASURE OUR TRADITIONS, AND 
ABOVE ALL, WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. 
INSIDE EVERYONE IN THIS GREAT 
CHAMBER TODAY AND EVERYONE 
LISTENING ALL AROUND THE GLOBE  
THERE IS THE HEART  OF A 
PATRIOT  THAT FEELS THE SAME 
POWERFUL LOVE FOR YOUR NATION , 
THE SAME INTENSE LOYALTY  TO 
YOUR HOME LAND.      
THE PASSION THAT BURNS  IN THE 
HEARTS OF PATRIOTS  AND THE 
SOULS OF NATIONS HAS INSPIRED 
REFORM AND REVOLUTION SACRIFICE 
AND SELFLESSNESS, SCIENTIFIC 
BREAKTHROUGHS AND MAGNIFICENT 
WORKS OF ART.      
OUR TASK  IS NOT TO ERASE IT, 
BUT TO EMBRACE IT.     
TO BUILD WITH IT, TO DRAW ON 
ITS ANCIENT WISDOM AND FIND 
WITHIN IT THE WILL TO MAKE OUR 
NATIONS GREATER, REGIONS SAFER 
AND THE WORLD  BETTER.       
TO UNLEASH THIS INCREDIBLE 
POTENTIAL IN OUR PEOPLE WE MUST 
DEFEND THE FOUNDATION THAT MAKE 
IT ALL POSSIBLE, SOVEREIGN AND 
INDEPENDENT NATIONS ARE THE 
ONLY VEHICLE WHERE FREEDOM HAS 
EVER SURVIVED. 
DEMOCRACY HAS EVERENDURED OR 
PEACE  HAS EVER PROSPERED.     
AND SO WE MUST PROTECT OUR 
SOVEREIGNTY AND OUR CHERISHED 
INDEPENDENCE ABOVE ALL.      
WHEN  WE DO,  WE WILL FIND NEW 
AVENUES FOR COOPERATION, 
UNFOLDING BEFORE US. 
WE WILL FIND NEWPASSION FOR 
PEACE-MAKING RISING WITHIN US. 
WE WILL FIND NEWPURPOSE, NEW 
RESOLVE AND NEW SPIRIT 
FLOURISHING ALL AROUND US.     
AND MAKING THIS A MORE 
BEAUTIFUL WORLD IN WHICH TO 
LIVE.      
SO TOGETHER LET US CHOOSE A 
FUTURE OF PATRIOTISM  
PROSPERITY AND PRIDE, LET US 
CHOOSE PEACE AND FREEDOM OVER 
DOMINATION AND DEFEAT. 
AND LETUS COME HERE TO THIS 
PLACE  TO STAND FOR OUR PEOPLE 
AND THEIR NATIONS.     
FOREVER STRONG, FOREVER 
SOVEREIGN, FOREVER JUST AND 
FOREVER THANKFUL FOR THE GRACE 
AND THE GOODNESS  AND THE GLORY 
OF GOD.       
THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU, AND 
GOD BLESS THE NATIONS OF THE 
WORLD. 
THANK YOU VERYMUCH.     
THANK YOU.        
. 
>> ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY I WISH TO THANK THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA FOR STATEMENT JUST 
MADE. 
MAY I REQUESTREPRESENTATIVES TO 
REMAIN SEATED WHILE WE --. 
>> ALL RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO 
PULL AWAY FROM THE UNITED 
NATIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSING THE 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR A LITTLE 
LESS THAN AN HOUR OR SO. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> WELCOME. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
>>  ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE
WERE SORT OF TALKING ABOUT AS 
WE WERE LISTENING IS, YOU KNOW, 
A LOT OF WHAT WE HEARD FROM HIM 
WE EXPECTED TO HEAR.    
BUT DID ANYTHING JUMP OUT AT 
YOU  AS NOVEL, DIFFERENT, NEW 
AT ALL? 
>> IN TERMS OF WHAT HE CITED 
FOR PROGRESS FOR THE UNITED 
STATES, YOU SAW AT THE TOP WHEN 
HE SPOKE ABOUT THE U.S. HAVING 
UM, ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN ANY 
OTHER ADMINISTRATION IN THIS 
YEAR AND THEN THERE WAS 
RESOUNDING LAUGHTER. 
>> YES. 
>>  I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT, BUT
OKAY. 
>> IT'S TRUE. 
>>  EXACTLY. 
THEN HE TRIED TOMOVE ON AND 
TALK ABOUT WHAT PROGRESS THE 
ADMINISTRATION HAS ACCOMPLISHED 
IN THE PAST YEAR. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> AND NORTH KOREA WAS ON THE 
TOP OF THE LIST. 
HE SPOKE ABOUTKIM JONG-uN AND 
THE CURRENTLY  AND THE STEPS 
THAT HE HAS TAKEN. 
HE SPOKE ABOUTENCOURAGING 
MEASURES IN TERMS OF U.S., 
NORTH KOREA TALKS AND THAT'S 
ALL TRUE TO A DEGREE, RIGHT? 
>> RIGHT. 
>> WE'VE SEEN THE 2 MEET IN 
SINGAPORE. 
WE HAVEN'T SEEN MUCHFOLLOW-UP 
AND TRUMP STAYED PRETTY FAR 
AWAY FROM THAT. 
THESE WERE SOME VERY, UM, NICE 
WORDS ABOUT KIM JONG-uN, BUT 
THIS WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF 
OTHER SUBSTANCE OTHER THAN 
ROLLING OUT THESE NEW 
SANCTIONS.     
. 
>> YOU KNOW, IT STRUCK ME THAT 
THE  SPEECH HAD A LOT OF STEVEN 
MILLER'S FINGER PRINTS ON IT 
THERE WAS A LOT OF PATRIOTISM 
AND THE PRESIDENT SAYING GLOBALI
GLOBALISM IS A GOOD THING.      
 
TO POLICIES THAT HAD LONG BEEN 
SORT OF DONE AWAY WITH IN THIS 
COUNTRY. 
>> GOVERNING FROM THAT 
STANDPOINT AND STANDING WHERE 
HE'S STANDING AT THE 
HEADQUARTERS OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS, RIGHT? 
>> RIGHT. 
>> THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL 
BODY CREATED AFTER WORLD WAR II 
TO AVOID INTERNATIONAL 
CONFLICT, TO COME TOGETHER, 
LOOK AT ISSUES TOGETHER TO 
BRING ALL THESE COUNTRIES 
TOWARDS A MORE PEACEFUL WORLD. 
TRUMP ISBASICALLY SAYING YOU DO 
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, WE'LL DO 
WHAT WE WANT TO DO, LET'S 
PROTECT SOVEREIGNTY AND PUSH ON 
THAT AS THE WAY FORWARD, RATHER 
THAN COLLECTIVE ACTION 
ALTOGETHER. 
>> THAT'S SUCH A GOOD POINT. 
AGAIN, IT'S NOT -- I MEAN, YOU 
KNOW, PATRIOTISM IS A WONDERFUL 
THING AND ALL OF US HERE AT 
THIS TABLE AND THIS COUNTRY ARE 
PATRIOTS AND LOVE OUR COUNTRY 
AS DO THE PEOPLE IN THAT BODY. 
YOUR POINT IS A GOOD ONE WHICH 
WAS IN THE WAKE OF WORLD WAR II 
WHERE IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT 
THE NATIONS HAD NOT BEEN ABLE 
TO COME TO AGREEMENTS WHERE 
THEY CAN CREATE PEACE THAT'S 
WHY THIS BODY WAS CREATED. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> IT FAILED AFTER WORLD WAR I. 
SO THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 
SUGGESTING WE'RE GOING TO DO 
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, YOU DO 
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND LET'S 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
>>  RIGHT, INDEPENDENCE OVER
GLOBAL CONTROL AND DOMINATION 
THAT'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT 
HE'S ALSO REFERENCING PAST U.S. 
FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVES THAT  
THIS ADMINISTRATION  DOESN'T 
ADHERE TO. 
HE SAID THATTHEY'RE NOT GOING 
TO BE HELD HOSTAGE TO THE OLD 
DOINGMAS OF THE PAST AND HE'S 
SHOWN A LIGHT ON THE MOVING OF 
THE U.S. EMBASSY IN ISRAEL. 
HE SPOKEABOUT THE TRADE 
CONFLICT THAT HE'S GOTTEN THE 
U.S. INTO. 
BASICALLY TRYING TO ASSERT  UM, 
THE U.S. POSITION THIS 
ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION ONTO 
FOREIGN POLICY IN A WAY THAT WE 
HAVEN'T SEEN IN THE PAST. 
>> THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING. 
STAND BY.     
WE'RE JOINED FROM THE UNITED 
NATIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. 
SO, UM, IGUESS I'LL FIRST GET 
YOUR OVERVIEW. 
WE WERE SORT OFDISCUSSING THE 
SPEECH AND KIND OF YOU KNOW, 
REMARKING THERE WAS NOTHING 
THAT JUMPED OUT AS REMARKABLE. 
BASICALLY WHAT WEHAD EXPECTED. 
WHAT'S YOUR TAKEON THE SPEECH 
THAW HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT? 
>> I THINK THE 3 OF Y'ALL HIT 
IT ON THE HEAD WHICH IS 
EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD FLEW IN 
THE FACE OF THE SPIRIT OF THE 
UN HERE. 
HE'SBEEN CRITICAL OF THE UN IN 
THE PAST. 
IN FACT, HE POSTED AVIDEO 
MESSAGE SAYING HE WAS SURPRISED 
THE UN COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH 
MORE THAN IT HAS, THAT IT HAS 
POTENTIAL. 
SO THISIS EXACTLY WHAT WE 
EXPECTED IN TERMS OF DELIVERING 
YET ANOTHER AMERICA FIRST 
MESSAGE, BUT I WILL SAY  WE 
WERE EXPECTING MORE OF A TALE 
OF 2 NUCLEAR AMBITIONS FROM MR. 
TRUMP. 
HOWEVER, IT WAS AN ABRIDGED 
VERSION, RIGHT, EVEN THOUGH HE 
THANKED KIM JONG-uN, HE ALSO 
ACKNOWLEDGED THERE WAS STILL A 
LOT OF WORK LEFT TO DO IN TERMS 
OF REACHING THAT GOAL TO DENZEL 
AND AS EXPECTED HE TALKED ABOUT 
IRAN OF COURSE THE CURRENT 
SITUATIONS FOR BOTH HE BELIEVED 
ARE DEPENDENT ON THEIR 
WILLINGNESS TO COME TO THE 
NEGOTIATING TABLE WITH THE U.S. 
BUT THE SLAMMING IRAN WAS NO 
SURPRISE, PAINTING THAT PICTURE 
AS DIRE AS ONE THAT IS NOT 
COOPERATIVE AND SORT OF, YOU 
KNOW, CRITICIZING THE REGIME. 
HE DIDN'T MENTION, HOWEVER, THE 
FACT THAT OVERNIGHT ALL OF THE 
OTHER COUNTRIES  THAT ARE STILL 
PART OF THAT AGREEMENT  
RECOGNIZED THAT  THE CURRENT 
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL IS WORKING. 
OF COURSE, THEPRESIDENT SAID 
THE SAME THING THAT EVEN THOUGH 
THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT 
REIMPOSING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS 
WOULD BE A STRATEGY TO PUT 
PRESSURE ON IRAN, IT'S NO . AND 
SO THE BURDEN IS ON PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TO EXPLAIN HIS STRATEGY 
AND WHY HE BELIEVES PULLING OUT 
OF THAT DEAL REMAINS THE BEST 
WAY FORWARD AND HE DID NOT TALK 
ABOUT THAT. 
>>YEAH, I -- 
>> DURING THE SPEECH. 
>>  I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY
INTERESTING THAT HE DIDN'T TALK 
ABOUT THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT 
SIGNED ONTO THAT DEAL AT ALL 
REALLY.       
 
SORT OF ATTACKING IRAN. 
>>YEAH. 
>> YEAH. 
>> THE OTHER THING HE DIDN'T 
MENTION IS HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT 
RUSSIA. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
YES. 
>>  YEAH. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> WHAT RUSSIA IS CURRENTLY 
DOING IN MEDDLING IN ELECTIONS 
WAS THAT SURPRISING. 
>>  I PUT IT IN ALL CAPS IN 
INTO NOTES BECAUSE RUSSIA 
QUESTION MARK, QUESTION MARK. 
BECAUSE HEUSED A WARNING TO 
SYRIA AS A SEGUE TO IRAN. 
HE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW, THE 
CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD PLAY 
OUT IF THERE WERE MORE CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS ATTACKS ON THE CIVILIAN 
THERE AND SAID, YOU KNOW, IT'S 
NOT ONLY SYRIA THAT HAS TO BE 
HELD ACCOUNTABLE HERE BUT ALSO 
THOSE FORCES BEHIND SYRIA THAT 
ARE FUNDING  YOU KNOW WHAT'S 
HAPPENING THERE AND ALLOWING IT 
TO HAPPEN THEN WENT RIGHT INTO 
IRAN'S PART, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, 
IN THAT MOMENT, I EXPECTED HIM 
TO ALSO MENTION RUSSIA.    
AND HE HAS TO BE FAIR IN THE 
PAST EVEN RECENTLY WARNED 
RUNNING BACK AND IRAN TO STOP 
THEIR PART IN THE SYRIAN 
CONFLICT OTHERWISE THEY WOULD 
FACE CONSEQUENCES AS WELL. 
BUTYOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT HE 
DID NOT DO THAT. 
SO HERE WE AREAGAIN ON ANOTHER 
MASSIVE GLOBAL STAGE WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO POINT THE FINGER AT MOSCOW 
AND HE DID NOT. 
>> RIGHT -- 
>>  
THAT'S EXACTLY -- 
>> RIGHT. 
>> YEAH, HE SAID -- HE WARNED 
GERMANY ON BECOMING DEPENDENT 
ON RUSSIAN ENERGY. 
BUT HE DIDN'TSPECIFICALLY 
TARGET RUSSIA AT ALL. 
>> NO, HE DIDN'T. 
HE ALSOTALKED ABOUT IMMIGRATION 
AND WE HAVE SOME SOUND OF WHAT 
HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THAT. 
LET'S TAKE ALISTEN.       
IT'S THERE, I SWEAR. 
>> WE RECOGNIZE THE RIGHT OF 
EVERY NATION IN THIS ROOM TO 
SET ITS OWN IMMIGRATION POLICY 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS NATIONAL 
INTEREST JUST AS WE ASK OTHER 
COUNTRIES TO RESPECT OUR OWN 
RIGHT TO DO THE SAME WHICH WE 
ARE DOING.    
THAT IS ONE REASON THE UNITED 
STATES WILL NOT PARTICIPATE  IN 
THE NEW  GLOBAL COMPACT ON 
MIGRATION.      
MY GRADUATION SHOULD NOT BE 
GOVERNED BY AN INTERNATIONAL 
BODY,  UNACCOUNTABLE TO OUR OWN 
CITIZENS.    
ULTIMATELY THE ONLY LONG-TERM 
SOLUTION TO THE MIGRATION 
CRISIS  IS TO HELP PEOPLE BUILD 
MORE HOPEFUL FUTURES IN THEIR 
HOME  COUNTRIES.      
MAKE THEIR COUNTRIES  GREAT 
AGAIN.     
. 
>> THERE YOU GO. 
GOT THAT LINEIN THERE. 
UM, THIS IS SOMETHINGWE HEARD 
FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
RECENTLY WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 
ALL THAT AMERICA DOES FOR 
MIGRANTS AND BASICALLY SAID 
OVER THERE. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> WHERE THEY'RE AT. 
AND THEPRESIDENT REITERATING 
THIS. 
IWAS ASKING ABOUT THE GLOBAL 
COMPACT ON MIGRATION.    
WHAT IS IT? 
. 
>>  YEAH, THE COMPACT ON
MIGRATION IS ALL THESE 
COUNTRIES COMING TOGETHER TO 
TRY AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO 
MAKE MIGRATION BETTER, TO WORK 
ON IT ALTOGETHER. 
THE U.S. ISSTEPPING AWAY FROM 
THAT. 
IMEAN, WE SAW JUST LAST WEEK 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT ROLL OUT A 
30 30,000 REFUGEE CAP, THE 
LOWEST IN HISTORY SINCE THE 
PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN 1980. 
SO WE DIDN'THEAR ANY COUNTRIES 
COMING FORWARD AND SUPPORTING 
THE U.S. FOR THAT DECISION. 
THAT ISREALLY IMPORTANT. 
YOU KNOW, WEEXPECT IT, 
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO 
COME OUT AGAINST THE U.S. BUT 
WE DIDN'T EXPECT SUCH A 
CALMNESS, SUCH A LACK OF 
COMMENTARY FROM FOREIGN NATIONS 
WHO ARE THE ONES THAT ARE 
ACTUALLY  YOU KNOW, PUTTING UP 
THEIR HOUSES , THEIR COUNTRIES 
TO SUPPORT THESE REFUGEES 
BECAUSE THE U.S. IS CLOSING THE 
DOOR. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>>   I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY 
ABOUT NORTH KOREA. 
LET'SPLAY A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. 
. 
>> ROCKETS ARE NO LONGER FLYING 
IN EVERY DIRECTION.    
NUCLEAR TESTING HAS STOPPED,    
SOME MILITARY FACILITIES  ARE 
ALREADY BEING DISMANTLED.    
OUR HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN RELEASED 
AND HAS PROMISED THE REMAINS OF 
OUR FALLEN HEROES ARE BEING 
RETURNED HOME. 
TO LAY AT REST ONAMERICAN SOIL. 
I WOULD LIKE TOTHANK CHAIRMAN 
KIM FOR HIS COURAGE AND FOR THE 
STEPS HE HAS TAKEN, THOUGH MUCH 
WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE.       
THE SANCTIONS WILL STAY IN 
PLACE  UNTIL  DENUCLEARIZATION 
OCCURS.   
. 
>> THAT'S AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE. 
>>  IT IS. 
ALTHOUGH I WONDER,THE CIA 
DIRECTOR HAS REMAINED 
DISCREPANT CAL ABOUT THE MOVES 
THAT NORTH KOREA IS MAKING  
SEEMINGLY TO CONTRAST THE 
PRESIDENT'S OPTIMISM. 
>> RIGHT. 
HERE'S WHY:  ALL THOSE THINGS 
THAT THE PRESIDENT JUST LISTED 
WERE THINGS THAT  WERE ALSO 
TRUE  ABOUT A MONTH AGO WHEN HE 
CANCELLED SECRETARY POP PAY I 
DON'T'S TRIP TO NORTH KOREA 
CITING A LACK OF PROGRESS. 
SO WHAT HAPPENEDBETWEEN THEN 
AND NOW? 
WELL, KIMJONG-uN SENT HIM A 
LETTER REQUESTING A SECOND 
MEETING. 
HEALSO HAD A MILITARY PARADE 
THAT DID NOT SHOWCASE  THE 
MISSILES AS HE DID IN THE PAST. 
THAT'S REALLY IT. 
BUT IN TERMSOF CONCRETE 
DELIVERABLES OR ANY KIND OF 
PLANS THAT SHOWS HE'S COMMITTED 
TO TAKING STEPS FORWARD WE 
DON'T HAVE THAT. 
THAT'S WHY THE SKEPTICISM IS 
THERE AND WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS 
YET TO ANSWER WHY HE HAS THIS 
RENEWED OPTIMISM ONE MONTH 
LATER AFTER CANCELLING THAT 
TRIP. 
SOMETHING THE ADMINISTRATION 
HAS NOT ANSWERED IS EVEN THOUGH 
THEY SAY THAT YOU KNOW, A 
SECOND SUMMIT IS ON THE BRINK 
AND YOU KNOW, BELIEVE IT WILL 
HAPPEN IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT 
FUTURE THEY HAVEN'T ANSWERED 
HOW IS THE STRATEGY GOING TO BE 
DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST 
SUMMIT, AND WHAT ARE THEY GOING 
TO HOPE TO LEAVE WITH IN TERMS 
OF WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED AFTER 
THE FIRST ONE? 
BECAUSE HERE WE ARE AGAIN THEN 
HAVING TO SAY AND ACKNOWLEDGE 
THAT THEY STILL HAVE A LOT OF 
WORK TO DO.      
UM, AND SO, I THINK, THE 
PRESIDENT WAS LISTENING, I 
THINK KIM JONG-uN WAS LISTENING 
AND KIM GOT AGAIN, WHAT HE 
ALWAYS WANTED WHICH WAS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES STANDING 
HERE THANKING HIM  IN THIS WAY 
AND SHOWING OPTIMISM ALL WEEK . 
MEANWHILE SAYING BY THEWAY, THE 
SANCTIONS ARE GOING TO STAY IN 
POLICE. 
SO IF ANYTHINGHE COULD SAY IN 
THIS TALE OF 2 NUCLEAR POWERS 
THAT ACTUALLY  UM, NORTH 
KOREA'S NOT GETTING MUCH. 
SO WHY WOULD IRANCOME TO THE 
BARGAINING TABLE WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT IS NOT MAKING ANY 
KIND OF CONCESSIONS DO YOU 
REMEMBER THIS NEGOTIATING 
PROCESS. 
AND SO EVEN THOUGH THEPRESIDENT 
TOOK A MILD VICTORY LAP, IT 
WASN'T AS MUCH AS I EXPECTED, 
ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO THIS 
TIME LAST YEAR WHEN HE COINED 
THE PHRASE LITTLE ROCKET MAN 
AND SAID HE WAS GOING TO 
TOTALLY DESTROY NORTH KOREA. 
>>YEAH, I WANT TO POINT OUT THE 
NORTH KOREANS ARE PLAYING HARD 
TO GET WITH THE U.S. THIS WEEK. 
MIKE POMPEO HAS EXTENDED AN 
INVITE TO MEET WITH THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER AND THEY HAVEN'T HEARD 
BACK YET. 
>>  THAT'S INTERESTING. 
>> GOSH. 
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOUEXPECT TO 
PUT YOUR HAND OUT AS A GESTURE 
AND THE NRTH KOREANS HAVEN'T 
GOTTEN BACK TO THEM, THAT 
DOESN'T LOOK SO GOOD FOR THE 
UNITED STATES HERE. 
IT'SSOMETHING THEY'RE KNOWN TO 
DO. 
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY FOLLOW 
THROUGH ON ALL OF THEIR PLANS. 
BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT 
THAT TRUMP REFERENCED NORTH 
KOREA DESTROYING SOME OF ITS 
MISSILE TEST LAUNCH SITES. 
HEWASN'T ABLE TO CITE ANY OF 
THE NUCLEAR TEST SITES THEY ARE 
DISMANTLING. 
IN FACT NORTHKOREA SAID DURING 
THEIR MEETING LAST WEEK 
 
U.S. TOOK  
MEASURES. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> THAT'S WHY IT WAS 
SIGNIFICANT THAT HE SAID THE 
SANCTIONS ARE GOING TO STAY IN 
PLACE. 
>>  EXACTLY. 
>> WHATEVER MESSAGE YOU'RE 
SENDING TO NORTH KOREA THAT'S 
ALL THEY CARE ABOUT, THAT LAST 
LINE THERE. 
>>  YES. 
>> AND CRITICS ARE SAYING WHY 
SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH KIM 
JONG-uN AGAIN WHEN YOU DON'T 
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT. 
THEOTHER SORT OF POINT THAT I 
WANT TO GET REACTION TO IS THE 
PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT 
IMMIGRATION. 
I'M NOT SURE IF WEHAVE SOME 
SOUND FROM THAT. 
DOWE HAVE SOUND OF THE 
PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT 
IMMIGRATION? 
>> I THINK IT MIGHT -- 
>> OKAY. 
>> WHAT SPECIFICALLY WERE YOU 
THINKING OF? 
>> I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT HE 
SAID WHERE HE SAID ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION FUELS CRIME, 
VIOLENCE AND POVERTY 
REITERATING A THEME THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS WHETHER AT ONE OF 
HIS RALLIES OR REMARKS TO THE 
PRESS.      
. 
>> WHAT STANDS OUT IS THAT HE 
JUST LIKE WHEN THE CHAOS WAS 
UNFOLDING AT OUR OWN BORDER 
HERE HE DOES NOT MAKE THE 
DISTINCTION, UM, FOR REFUGEES 
FOR PEOPLE FLEEING THEIR HOME 
COUNTRIES.    
BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE 
HAD NO CHOICE BECAUSE THEY FEEL 
LIKE THEY'RE. 
       
WHO IS TRYING TO LEAVE THEIR 
COUNTRY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. 
AND ITHINK THAT'S WHERE HE 
MAKES A MISTAKE  
AT THIS INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
YOU KNOW, IN A IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION AND, 
AGAIN,     
HIS ARGUMENT THAT HE MAKES  
MORE SO FOR HIS BASE I WOULD 
SAY, UM, THAN ANY OTHER. 
YOU KNOW, SHOWS THAT IN HIS 
MIND HE ALWAYS KNOWS HIS 
AUDIENCE AND NOT NECESSARILY 
THE AUDIENCE SITTING RIGHT 
BEFORE HIM. 
>> ALL RIGHT.      
AT THE UN THANK YOU AS ALWAYS 
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
WE'LLTALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT 
LATER. 
YOU'RE STICKING AROUND. 
SOLET'S TALK ABOUT CHINA. 
LET'SPLAY WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
HAD TO SAY ABOUT CHINA AND GET 
YOUR REACTION.       
. 
>> GO TO SOUND ON CHINA IN THE 
TRADE. 
>> THE UNITED STATES HAS JUST 
ANNOUNCED TARIFFS ON ANOTHER 2 
$200 BILLION IN CHINESE MADE 
GOODS FOR A TOTAL SO FAR OF 
$250 BILLION.    
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT AND 
AFFECTION FOR MY FELONY, BUT 
I'VE MADE CLEAR OUR TRADE 
IMBASS IS YOU FELT JUST NOT 
ACCEPTABLE. 
CHINA'SMARKET DISTORTIONS AND 
THEY WAY THEY DEAL CANNOT BE 
TOLERATED. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 
WALKING THE FINE LINE BETWEEN 
CRITICIZING THE CHINESE BUT 
ALSO TALKING ABOUT HOW HE'S GOT 
GREAT RESPECT. 
>> UM-HUM. 
EARLIER IN THESPEECH HE PRAISED 
CHINA FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE WITH 
NORTH KOREA. 
>> YEAH. 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ITHINK 
HIGHLIGHT WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS 
SAYING ABOUT CHINA BECAUSE ON 
ONE HAND YOU DO HAVE TO WALK 
THE FINE LINE, CHINA IS A 
MASSIVE SOUP POWER AND THERE 
ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY CHINA 
MANAGES ITS ECONOMY. 
THEQUESTION, OF COURSE, IS SOME 
CASES FOR EXAMPLE IT'S HURTING 
AMERICAN FARMERS AND 
MANUFACTURERS. 
>>  YEAH. 
>> THAT'S THE LINE THAT HE'S 
TRYING TO THREAD. 
>> AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS 
TO SUBSIDIZE THESE DECISIONS 
THEY'VE MADE ON TRADE TO BACK 
UP THEIR ACTIONS BECAUSE 
THEY'RE HURTING AMERICAN 
FARMERS AND THESE FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES AREN'T STUPID. 
THEY'RE GOING TO COMEBACK AT 
THE U.S. AND ARGET CITIES AND 
TARGET STATES  THAT ARE KNOWN 
TO HAVE TRUMP SUPPORTERS. 
WE'RE COMING UP ONTHE MID-TERMS 
RIGHT NOW. 
SOTHEY WANT TO GO BACK AT THE 
U.S. AND HURT TRUMP WHERE IT 
HURTS THE MOST. 
IT'S ALSO A LITTLEBIT CONFUSING 
BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN AS YOU 
SAID TRUMP SAY THAT CHINA HAS 
BEEN HELPFUL ON NORTH KOREA, 
BUT ACTUALLY  THEY HAVEN'T BEEN 
ALL THAT HELPFUL ON NORTH 
KOREA. 
THEY'RE THE ONESTHAT ARE STILL 
FUELLING NORTH KOREA'S ECONOMY 
AND THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN 
ALLOWING CERTAIN THINGS TO GO 
ACROSS A BORDER CONTINUALLY. 
>>  RIGHT. 
>> I WONDER -- LET'S TALK MORE 
ABOUT THIS IDEA OF SOVEREIGNTY 
AND FOCUSSING INWARD AND LESS 
GO AGREEING AND COMING TO THE 
TABLE WITH PARTNERS AND ALLIES 
AROUND THE WORLD. 
I WONDER THERE ARE ALOT OF 
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT 
LIKE THIS COURSE. 
THEYTHINK THE U.S. HAS BEEN 
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. 
I GUESS MYQUESTION IS TAKING A 
STEP BACK: THE IDEA THAT IN 
SOME INSTANCES THE UNITED 
STATES MAY NOT GET EVERYTHING 
THAT IT WANTS BUT IT DOES GET 
PEACE IN  ALL PARTS OF THE 
WORLD WHERE  COUNTRIES KNOW 
THAT IF THEY ATTEMPT  AND -- IF 
THEY ATTEMPT TO  COMMIT GENERAL 
SIDE ON THEIR OWN PEOPLE THAT 
THE UNITED STATES WILL BE THERE 
TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. 
BY THE PRESIDENT SAYING LOOK, 
DO WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO WITHIN 
YOUR OWN BORDERS, WE'RE GOING 
TO DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO, COULD 
BE DETRIMENTAL IN THE LONG-
TERM, NOT FOR US, PEOPLE IN 
COUNTRIES WHERE GOVERNMENTS DO 
NOT TAKE ANY HINTS OR ADVICE 
FROM COUNTRIES LIKE THE UNITED 
STATES AND SAY I'M NOT GOING TO 
GET INVOLVED. 
>> RIGHT. 
AND A LOT OF TIMESFOREIGN 
POLICY AND AID IS STRATEGIC. 
THEY'RE THINKINGABOUT THE LONG 
GAME.    
AND SO WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SAID IN THIS SPEECH IS, YOU 
KNOW, IF THE U.S. IS GOING TO 
BE GIVING AID  
RESPECT US, THAT'S A LITTLE BIT 
OF A DIFFERENT TAKE ON WHAT 
U.S. FOREIGN POLICY HAS 
TRADITIONALLY FOLLOWED IN THE 
PAST. 
YOU KNOW,EGYPT IS NOT 
NECESSARILY A COUNTRY THAT 
ALWAYS RESPECTS THE UNITED 
STATES  THEY'RE ONE OF OUR 
LARGEST RECIPIENTS OF FOREIGN 
AID AND THERE'S A REASON FOR 
THAT. %
>> YEAH. 
>> BECAUSE THEY ARE A PILLAR OF 
STABILITY IN AN AREA WHERE THE 
U.S. WANTS TO SEE A STABLE 
MIDDLE EAST. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> SORRY -- 
>> GO AHEAD. 
>> THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY 
IS THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES: 
IF THE UNITED STATES IS SEEDING 
AND SAYING WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS 
WITHIN MORE OF OUR OWN NATIONAL 
INTERESTS AND BORDERS, THEN 
THAT LEAVES A VACUUM AND WHO IS 
LEFT TO FILL THAT VACUUM SO TO 
YOUR POINT ABOUT NOT WORRYING 
ABOUT THE ELECTIONS, WORRYING 
ABOUT THE BASE IN 10 OR 15 
YEARS WHEN -- WHAT IT WAS 
BECAUSE OF CHINA SEEING THAT 
VACUUM AND SORT OF FILLING IT. 
I SEEN THATIN AFRICA FOR 
EXAMPLE. 
>> I THINK IT'S ALREADY BEEN 
HAPPENING. 
WE'VE SEEN CHINAWITH ITS 
ECONOMIC INFLUENCE ACROSS THE 
GLOBE. 
AND WE'RESEEING OTHER COUNTRIES 
-- EXACTLY. 
>>YEAH, YOU KNOW, WHAT I WANTED 
TO PIVOT BACK TO IS THE IRAN 
DEAL.  
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE SOUND 
I WANTED TO PLAY AND TALK TO 
YOU ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS SAID BEFORE HE'D 
BE OPEN TO MEETING WITH THE 
PRESIDENT. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> LET'S JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HE 
HAD TO SAY. 
>> IRAN'S LEADERS -- 
 
DEATH AND DESTRUCTION. 
THEY DONOT RESPECT THEIR 
NEIGHBORS OR BORDERS OR THE 
SOVEREIGN RIGHTS OF NATIONS. 
INSTEAD,  IRAN'SEADERS 
PLUNDER THE NATION'S RESOURCES 
TO ENRICH THEMSELVES AND TO 
SEPARATED MAYHEM ACROSS THE 
MIDDLE EAST  AND FAR BEYOND.    
THAT IS WHY SO MANY  COUNTRIES 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST     STRONGLY 
SUPPORTED MY DECISION TO 
WITHDRAW THE UNITED STATES  
FROM THE HONORABLE 2015 IRAN 
NUCLEAR DEAL.     
AND REIMPOSE NUCLEAR SANCTIONS. 
. 
>> SO WHAT I THOUGHT WAS SORT 
OF INTERESTING ABOUT THOSE 
WORDS IS THAT IT WAS REALLY 
PERM ATTACK ON THE LEADERSHIP. 
I KNOW WE'VEBEEN HEARING THAT 
FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE. 
YOU KNOW,YOU'VE HEARD HIM OFTEN 
SAY IF THE PEOPLE OF IRON DON'T 
LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING THEY 
SHOULD PROBABLY ADDRESS IT WITH 
THEIR LEADERSHIP. 
I HEARD A REINFORCEAM OF THAT.  
. 
>> I MEAN, AND TRUTH BE TOLD WE 
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING 
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND BACK 
CHANNELS. 
LAST YEAR AT THE UNGENERAL 
ASSEMBLY IT WAS THE U.S. THAT 
WENT TO THE FRENCH AND ASK IF 
HE'D SIT DOWN WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND THE IRANIAN AS SAID 
NO. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> BECAUSE THEY'RE FLOATING 
THAT OUT BECAUSE THEY REALLY DO 
WANT A MEETING TO HAPPEN BUT 
DON'T WANT TO BE EMBARRASSED ON 
THE PUBLIC WORLD STAGE, RIGHT? 
WHENWE LOOK AT IRAN WE'RE GOING 
TO HAVE A LOT MORE TOMORROW 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS 
HOSTING THE U.N. SECURITY 
COUNCIL MEETING AND THE U.S. 
WANTS IRAN TO BE THE FOCUS OF 
THAT.     
SO TRUMP IS PROBABLY GOING TO 
FACE SOME BLOW BACK FROM HIS 
ALLIES HONOR NOT SO SUPPORTIVE 
OF WHAT THE U.S. HAS DONE WITH 
REGARD TO PULLING OUT OF THE 
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. 
>> ALWAYS GRADE TO HAVE YOUR 
ANALYSIS AND YOUR REPORTING. 
THANK YOU FOR SPENDING SOME 
TIME WITH US. 
WE APPRECIATE IT.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
STICK AROUND WE'RE GOINGTO GET 
BACK TO YOU JUST AFTER THIS 
BREAK.
