cynical Democrat politicians who failed at every level to prevent the high school shooting in parkland Florida are now excusing everybody who had anything to do with preventing the shooting and placing all of the blame on the NRA which is a civil rights organization that had absolutely nothing to do with the shooting this is par for the course for Democrats who have long pushed gun control to oppress black people and other minorities and really just all the rest of us we will analyze the racist history of gun control and the real purpose of the Second Amendment I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Noel's show this show might as well just be retitled the NRA is great and a wonderful beautiful thing a 40 minute defense of the NRA but before we get to that before we get to them this is one of my favorite topics I have been glued to Twitter all weekend because I've just been defending the NRA and the right to keep and bear arms because as Ronald Reagan pointed out it's not that our liberal friends are ignorant it's just they know so many things that aren't so they have this issue completely backwards exactly upside down as they as they frequently do before we get to

deal do it okay the nra is under fire and these kids you know the kids from florida who are being prostituted by CNN they are pushing this very very hard and it isn't working by the way but it's working for somebody's working for the nra my entire Twitter feed for the past several days has been people posting pictures that they're signing up for the NRA I'm already a life member of the NRA if I were I'd be I could be a double life member if I were a cat I'd get eight more life memberships I hope the NRA is giving CNN a cut here because they're clearly cleaning up and the CNN keeps pushing these kids they keep prostituting these kids I think their 15 minutes is running out I kind of feel bad for them when I they're 17 years old when I was 17 like David hog I thought and said a lot of very stupid things unlike David hog the adults in my life didn't prostitute me on CNN and a really problem screw up my professional future and some of my personal life there but for the grace of God go high I really do kind of feel for these kids even though they're very annoying and they don't know anything and they keep calling people murderers and they're really saying terrible things on television I do feel for them their idiot kids they donate II n'ajjer says stupid things all the time that's the definition of a teenager now that the main kid that you see the telegenic one David hog he's he's now moving on to push education or something I think cuz he knows his 15 minutes are up he just sent out a tweet he said here's a radical idea how about we don't spend money on arming teachers we spend it instead educating students in stem so people can do more cool stuff and we'll be able to create jobs and renewable clean and independent American energy like wind and solar I don't know I don't know what he's gonna throw it next we will start talking about abortion or something yesterday his mission was to make school safe now it's to increase science funding which by the way isn't in either or you can you know he's just moving on it's the slate of Democrat talking points because he wants to squeeze out another minute on television he clearly likes the camry wants to be on camera who can blame him you know he's like he wants to be on camera that's true for a lot of people but this is really backfiring he's now blaming the NRA a lot of these other kids are blaming the NRA Republican politicians who defend the civil liberties through the shooting they're implying that they're murderers this is overreaching and it's really wearing thin I don't want to criticize these teenagers they're just idiot teenagers that's why I don't care I do criticize CNN for prostituting them and the adults in their lives for prostituting them it's really wearing thin guys so I don't know I guess keep it up I guess keep it up it'll only help conservatives we we're told now as by these kids and by CNN by all everyone else that we don't need guns ourselves because law enforcement will protect us but of course in this case law enforcement failed at every level here it failed all the way as high as the FBI which received tips didn't follow up and it certainly failed at the sheriff's level where deputies waited well this crazy shooter was blowing people to bits and he was waiting outside with a gun because he was too cowardly to go in here is the sheriff sheriff Scott Israel avoiding all blame whatsoever Jake I could only take responsibility for what I knew about ie exercises my due diligence I've given amazing leadership to this aging leaders I've work amazing leadership I also love he says I can only take responsibility for what I knew about you should have known about more there were how many completely dozens of complaints about these kids he said why I didn't know right you didn't know because you're a terrible sheriff you didn't know because you're awful at running your Sheriff's Office that's the prayer that's all I can Oh like if I didn't know I can't take responsibility you can take responsibility for negligence at least negligence maybe more and I got to tell you if you haven't seen that whole Jake Tapper review it's worth watching I'm very mean to Jake Tapper because Jake Tapper has become a mean girl who carries water for Democrats he did that awful Town Hall the other night and he allowed those teenagers to call Marco Rubio a mass murderer that was really awful but this tapper was great this was the good old tapper I don't know where that guy's been but when when Jake Tapper wants to be he can be a journalist and I wish he would do this more often the interview was very good this brings us to the really bizarre point lefties are comparing gun control gun control to the civil rights movement they are opposing the NRA an organization whose sole purpose is to defend civil rights they're calling that the civil rights movement here's Oprah it's a proud moment it's an evolving moment for our country the same thing happened as you know back in the 50s and 60s for the civil rights movement young people said we will not tolerate what our ancestors have tolerated we have had enough and we're willing to fight for it and willing to do march in the streets for it and if necessary die for it the activist Ruby Hall agrees Ruby Hall said when I think about our babies today and them not being safe in school I think that should be the next civil rights movement you know is to ban the assault weapons so that our babies can be safe inigo montoya your reaction if gives you Cynthia forth I don't think I miss what you're thinking miss that's a great point in ego that is a great point if they keep using the phrase civil rights but what they really mean is they want to deprive us of our civil rights they're saying we support civil rights and and we were supportive all right so much then we're gonna take away one of your memo basic civil rights we should clear this up this is a civil rights issue but Oprah is on the wrong side of the civil rights issue if this were the 1960s she would be on the side of George Wallace she would be on the side if this were the 1860s should be on the side of the Democrats then to the ones wearing the hoods this is a civil rights issue the right to keep and bear arms is a civil right as it cut it is a constitutionally protected civil right and it's a civil right that throughout history has been denied black people so that White's could oppress them this has happened for centuries the NRA exists to protect that civil right against all sorts of tyranny and especially to protect minorities who for centuries have regularly seen their civil rights trampled on the NRA here's just a brief history of the NRA a brief history of the racist gun control laws in this country and why anybody who's concerned with civil rights anybody who's concerned with racial equality should vehemently oppose gun control the NRA was founded in 1871 it is the oldest continuously operating civil rights organization and the largest and best funded lobbying organization in the United States now it's well funded why is it well funded because people like our civil rights we like our civil rights there's this insane a suggestion now on the left because they realize Americans like our guns and we like our freedom so they say well the NRA they don't really represent gun owners they don't really represent civil rights advocates they just represent the gun makers as though that's as though there's a difference I have news for you the gun makers and the gun owners have a few things in common we like guns we like freedom and we don't like gun control that we're on the same side of this thing it isn't those those darn gun makers they keep making guns that I like and buy those are those monster that I hate they're lobby we're on the same side it's the same lobby we we have the same agenda here which is to protect civil rights by the way even if we're talking about the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s gun control has been the single most important tool of white supremacists for centuries the first gun control law in American history was passed not in the 20th century not in the 19th century but in the 17th century in virgin in 1640 that gun control law specifically prohibited blacks from owning guns that was it and not just slaves you might say well slaves couldn't own guns because they didn't have a lot of other rights it also prevented freedmen men who were not slaves from owning guns as well because the whites in Virginia in 1640 did not want to tolerate blacks having guns what would happen if they had guns who knows after NAT Turner's slave rebellion in Virginia in 1931 that state prohibited even free blacks to keep or carry any firelock of any kind any military weapon or any powder or lead now even before that was passed into law in after before the nat turner rebellion in 1831 even before that a free black family was found possessing a lead shot which was using a scale weights this family didn't have any gunpowder it didn't have any weapons whatsoever nevertheless Virginian mobs descended on this family and they debated executing the owner of just the lead just being used for scale weights excuse me in 1834 the Tennessee legislature amended its state constitution the state constitution previously had said the freemen of this state have a right to keep in to bear arms for their common defense they then changed that provision of the state constitution to say the free white men of this state ever right to keep and bear arms for their common defense just a just a subtle linguistic shift but it deprived a huge percentage of the population from keeping arms now we get to the Dred Scott decision the Dred Scott decision occurred in 1857 Dred Scott determined that any black person whose ancestors were slaves could not be an American citizen this is one of the regularly cited as the worst if and certainly one of the worst decisions in American history that decision hinged on the question of gun ownership so it obviously was a predate of the Civil War only by three years but the Chief Justice in the Dred Scott decision wrote it would give them the full Liberty to keep and carry arms wherever they went this was a major aspect of Dred Scott if if if they were just promising citizenship it's two black Americans without without that provision to actually protect them maybe the Dred Scott decision would have gone a different way but it isn't just words words words which can be trampled over by a powerful and armed government that citizenship in the United States also gives you the right to protect yourself in many in many cases uniquely or in a uniquely American way after the Confederates surrender in 1865 after the Civil War was over defeated southerners very quickly rounded up all the guns from freed blacks Frederick Douglass a good Republican implored the federal government to stop the state and local governments from infringing on the right of the people to keep and bear arms state and local governments would just round all of these up and this is an important distinction which we're going to talk about tomorrow when we analyze the second amendment who has the right to keep and bear arms is that the state is the federal government is it the people the the amendment is clear and that distinction really matters Frederick Douglass actually insisted though that until blacks were able to keep guns the work of the abolitionists was not finished consider that now we're being told by lightly educated people and people with a nefarious political agenda and anti civil rights political agenda on television that it's a racial equality issue to take away all of their guns Frederick Douglass who was not lightly educated Frederick Douglass who was a genius and a new much better he knew is exactly the opposite in the Texas Supreme Court case Cockrum versus state 1959 the court recognized the right to carry defensive arms both in the Second Amendment and in the Texas Bill of Rights an individual right to keep your guns they recognize this in I'm sorry 1859 yet just a handful of years later in 1872 the Texas Supreme Court denied that there was any right to carry any weapon for self-defense in either Constitution and either the Federal Constitution or in the state constitution and you know how they defended that decision they didn't they offered absolutely no explanation whatsoever I wonder what changed between 1859 and 1872 1859 one year before the Civil War in eighteen seventy two seven years after the Civil War what what what what changed about the ability to keep and bear arms so the NRA how was it founded was founded in 1871 by Union soldiers not by those nefarious racists by the people who fought a bloody bloody war to free the slaves I was first charted in New York in 1871 the first president of the NRA was the Union general Ambrose Burnside fresh off of freeing all the slaves and reuniting the Union the NRA s 8th president was u.s. grant ulysses s grant president of both the United States and the NRA and a great defender of civil rights and defeater of southern secessionists slavers the NRA was founded at actually not initially just to lobby Congress or Lobby for good gun laws because gun control was a regional issue that clearly at this time was used mostly to oppress blacks it was actually founded because the Union troops were terrible shots so the Union troops were firing something like a thousand rifle rounds for each Confederate they hit they weren't very good at shooting so it was founded to give people like the Union troops who defended ordered Liberty and defended human dignity better training now that there is this a crazy aspect since the shooting in Florida people are saying what we need to do is have mandatory training so they want all these things they want to ban certain guns they want to raise the age they basically just want fewer people to have guns they say we need mandatory gun training this doesn't make any sense at all what you're saying is that the way to prevent a mass shooting like we saw in Florida is to train the people to be better shots they want to Train mass shooters to be better at shooting guns it doesn't make any sense and first of all the NRA already offers training and it has for 150 years why would mandatory training be the solution to mass shooters mandatory training for a lot of other people giving guns to more people allowing guns to be easier to be had and having the good guys trained to use guns that would be good but really we should borrow the bad guys from from training in general it's a total deflection though it's just one of these empty points it's they throw spaghetti at the wall because they don't like guns they don't want you to have guns and they're gonna use any argument no matter how tenuous it is to try to take guns away from you do you remember Democrats who rode around in white sheets lynching the blacks they were able to do that because white Democrats had already taken the guns away from blacks the special report of the Paris anti-slavery Conference of 1867 found as much they concluded the freedmen in the South quote were forbidden to own or bear firearms and thus were rendered defenseless against assault speaking of very important Supreme Court decisions Albion tourgee a the civil rights attorney who represented Plessy in Plessy v Ferguson in 1896 Plessy v Ferguson you remember upheld segregation as separate but equal that attorney tor J pointed out that where the KKK took control quote almost universally the first thing done was to disarm the Negroes and leave them defenseless we see this by the way in totalitarian regimes around the world it's it's almost cliche to refer to Hitler in this regard but it's true if totalitarian regimes everywhere they take away the guns that's the first thing they do because the Second Amendment exists to protect the First Amendment the Second Amendment exists to protect all of the other rights because ultimately if people are going to trample on your rights you've got to defend them and you've got to defend yourself fortunately despite the Democrats and the KKK running roughshod over the Civil Rights particularly of black people Republicans came to the defense of civil rights they passed the Freedmen's Bureau bill of 1865 to protect the rights of free blacks they passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1870 which guaranteed everybody the right of self-defense then that brings us to the anti Klan act of 1871 but you're telling me I got to go I got a thing about a Facebook in YouTube so what I have to bet awful I already said goodbye to YouTube I've already said my goodbyes to YouTube a long time ago but we have to say goodbye we have to say goodbye to Facebook and if you if somehow you made it and are seeing us on YouTube please stick around too please try to figure out a way to let everybody else in and then shut down the censors at YouTube who are not allowing anybody to watch this show this this awful show this bigoted show that talks about civil rights and the history of legislation of the United States how awful of course they have to censor it if you're on Facebook you got to go to Daley wired.com right now we have so much more to talk about the Klan and more Democrat atrocities happened in history but if you want to do that you got to go to Delhi why're you calm it's $10 a month or $100 for an annual membership you get me you get the Andrew flavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get the conversation next time is going to have the big boss Ben Shapiro you can ask him whatever questions you want if you remember everybody can watch few can ask questions many are called few are chosen you get to ask all of us questions in the mailbag and we're gonna be doing that on Thursdays to get your questions in but again none of that matters nobody's here for that what you're all here for is this because every time Democrats prostitute some child on television and every time they recite the same tired incoherent anti-american anti-constitutional lines to take away our guns and another person joins the NRA another person joins the NRA and I get another delicious eight ounces of salty leftist tears and they are so good I was on I was gorging myself this weekend I was truly a glutton I probably should go to confession for it thankfully I have a lot of these leftist tears Tumblr's the only fda-approved vessel to store salty and delicious leftist tears go to daily wired.com to get it we'll be right back where were we we were on the antique clan act it's a good place to come in thank you again Republicans the original draft of the anti clan Act of 1871 which Republican president and NRA president u.s. grant shepherded through Congress made it a federal felony to deprive any citizen of the United States of any arms he possessed for the defense of his person his family or his property not any white person like the Democrats wanted any person that was shepherded by NRA president ulysses s grant and and Republican president Kansas senator Samuel Pomeroy described three indispensable quotes safeguards of Liberty under our form of government that's the sanctity of the home the right to vote and the right to bear arms there was this guy on Twitter Stephen Metz who referred to me and all of my fellow defenders of the Second Amendment as gun fetishists okay do do we also have vote fetishists those people who think we should keep the right to vote or those vote fetishists or their free speech fetishists also what he really means the civil rights advocates but he's trying to turn it and make it seem like all we want to do is we just like the technical aspects of guns technical aspects of guns are great freedom is better they are there to protect our freedom racist Democrats now kept getting around gun control laws which technically had to be race neutral after the Civil War they could have the 14th amendment these gun laws had to be race neutral so those Democrats got craftier they would frequently ban inexpensive guns while allowing guns that whites already owned so there's poor blacks who had recently been freed just couldn't afford the guns and it was practically impossible for them an Ohio Supreme Court justice acknowledged that these laws were intended to quote entirely disarmed the negro and it wasn't just blacks who were targets and victims of Democrats gun control policies and it didn't just happen in the South in 1840 in 1920 the Ohio Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a Mexican man for concealed carry of a handgun now that's fine I suppose if you want to convict him for that the trouble was that the Mexican man was asleep in his bed during the time of the alleged infraction it's just wanted to a residence guy Brad a gun basically anybody in Ohio could have been arrested for this because I guess he was concealed carrying in his dreams or something Jim Crow law has became the foundation of modern gun control in America we free we now think there were books that the left rights are the new Jim Crow and they decry all of these good things for freedom and they don't talk about how Jim Crow is the foundation of gun control it started in the south but it spread north in the early 20th century in in New York it was aimed at Italians and Jews and I will say as someone of Italian heritage in America fair enough that's fair that's fair I gave the Italians they did use guns a little loose in New York so okay fair enough they also aim these laws at labor agitators in California and at blacks who defended themselves in race riots in Missouri and Michigan as Ann Coulter described it in 2012 the NRA was the sole organization to come to the defense of Roger F Williams Roger F Williams was a world war two marine veteran who returned to his hometown of Monroe North Carolina to fight a Klan they've found the Ku Klux Klan riding high so the NRA granted him a charter to start a chapter when he got back there the Klan was truly terrorizing blacks in Monroe he asks the NRA to start a chapter the NRA grants it he founded the black armed guard and guess what happened the Klan cut it out the Klan lost its stranglehold on the town so weird when you give victims guns all of a sudden the victimizers I get a little bit more careful before they start running you know and they're stupid capes and and sheets John Salter a professor and the chief organizer of the n-double a-c-p Jackson movement during the early 1960s wrote quote no one knows what kind of massive racist retaliation would have been directed against grass roots black people had the black community not had a healthy measure of firearms within it no one knows that's not some wicked white conservative man in 2018 that's a major civil rights leader on the eve of the n-double a-c-p 's 1959 national convention the group resolved quote we do not deny but reaffirm the right of individual and collective self-defense against unlawful assault no less a peace activist and Martin Luther King jr. agreed to that he actually went so far as to support violence exercised in self-defense which he called moral and legal in all societies and he pointed out that it was not even opposed by Gandhi so this is an example of the left perverting history and values beyond recognition they always said but but how more luther king couldn't possibly have advocated self-defense he all you'd like just like peace why did they forget that he he clearly did in 1959 yeah they point out that jesus said turn the other cheek they seemed to forget all of the other aspects of scripture where our Lord told his apostles to sell their cloaks and buy swords they forget that he whipped money changers in the temple that wasn't just metaphorical he took out whips the the logos made flesh he whipped them who in the temple they forget these defenses of self-defense now for centuries for centuries Democrats have run roughshod over over civil liberties and particularly over the the civil right to gun ownership without giving any reasons why you know it always comes down to emotional pleas with them that's what it's always a bad emotion the the think think of what the blacks would do if they had guns say well but the Constitution says they have to have guns no but think of what they would do think of the white women think of the children it's all the same fact free demagoguery they don't actually point to the realities of gun ownership they don't point to the legalities of gun ownership they say oh but think of this they what are you a monster what you don't like white women what you don't like the little children that we're pimping out on CNN we're gonna cover tomorrow the nuts and bolts of the Second Amendment itself we have an excellent guest on to discuss it should i no i won't i won't spoil the surprise but a really a nationwide leader to discuss this we will explain the history of the amendment we will explain the history of the rights that it protects to keep and bear arms why the second amendment is not about shooting deer with ar-15s actually you shouldn't shoot deer where they are 15 s anyway that's not very humane it's not powerful enough to hunt deer and multiple wives us an individual right I want to leave you with this the left has no argument here there is no or the Democrats have no or it is the same fact free emotional plea and demagoguery that they had been using for centuries they vilified blacks for exercising their rights they vilified Italians and Jews for doing it they vilified Mexicans for doing it all the while they were defended those people were defended the victims were defended by civil rights supporters like members of the NRA now the much-maligned NRA again by Democrats now their vilifying civil rights defenders themselves imagine what they could do if these Democrats did succeed at disarming you we actually know what they could do because they did it to all of those groups that I just mentioned for centuries and it wasn't pretty to use a further historical example a further back historical example the Persian King Xerxes demanded that the Spartans surrender their their weapons and King Leonidas responded Malone LaVey come and take him the violent bloody history of gun control should teach us to defend our constitutionally protected civil right to self-defense with precisely the same seriousness and urgency come and take them come and take I'm gonna come and take those delicious leftist tears and put them on my tumblr because the news cycles have just gotten more and more outrageous and they are Luka they're not going to get it they are not going to get it on this it's such a childish discussion that's why they use children to do it okay we will analyze the the Second Amendment itself tomorrow in the meantime I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Knoll show come back tomorrow we'll do it all again the Michael Dole show is a daily
