special election out in Ohio last night the last special election before the November midterms and it strongly suggests that blue wave Republicans fear it may well be building now the race officially remains too close to call Republicans Roybal derson he is clinging to a lead right there you see if 1564 votes over Danny O'Connor the Democrat of course the backdrop a district here that president Trump won by 11 points in 2016 there are still ballots being counted also a piece of news we can tell you about just a couple of hours ago Franklin County the largest part of this district officials there said that a counting error will drop bald ursins lead by a hundred and ninety votes when we're talking about something this small that is potentially significant there that certainly increases the possibility of a recount in this district now despite potentially averting a disaster there in Ohio for his party president Trump today tried to take a victory lap writing on Twitter as long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates within reason they will win if I find the time which I must we will have a giant red wave Trump also claimed his 11th hour appearance over the weekend in the district was the golden ticket in the race riding when I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Ball derson he was down in early voting 64 to 36 that was not good after my speech on Saturday night there was a big turn for the better now not everybody agrees with that assessment Republican pollster Frank Luntz noting I'm sure Republicans will celebrate tonight but a one-point victory in that district is nothing to commend the GOP have to do something really significant in September if they want to keep the house in November for more I'm joined by Michelle Goldberg columnist for The New York Times Noelle Nick poor Republican strategist and Philip Rucker White House bureau chief for The Washington Post thanks to all of you for being with us and well let me just ask you this the Trump factor right he came to the district and there's a revolt afoot against Donald Trump in the suburbs of that district and I think a lot of the suburbs of this country there's also a lot of affection for him in the rural areas and there's some talk that maybe he did help Republicans there that's a conundrum for Republican candidates this fall isn't it right you know what and something you brought up - my point is fact that when President Trump came in who's to say that it didn't push the opponent's numbers up because of people that don't like Donald Trump so they feel more energized to get out and vote against the backlash right sure so it's cuz what do you do here if you're a Republican candidate you're in one of these competitive races the president said hey I want to come to your district this fall what do you tell him it's the same catch-22 as when Obama was trying to do some campaigning with with people that were running on the Democratic ticket that were like he I don't want him to come campaign for me the same thing when Bush was getting out of office and we had a lot of surrogates running and people are like would you like you know george w bush to come they're like well we do not so i think it depends on where you are what's really interesting about Ohio is the fact that it is usually red red red and the fact that we have not moved the needle with big numbers that's scary and although you know I know President Trump and Republican Party everybody's taking a victory lap I don't think that I agree with Frank Luntz on this you don't need to take a full-out pop the champagne huge celebration on this because we need to look at these numbers we need to look at the candidate and see where if there is a fail within the candidate specifically or we need to look at what's behind this and see are we in trouble and I think that we're ona Romney McDaniels when she came out and said you know this is a victory and this is great we're celebration I think that's great and I love her I think she's great but I think that one of the things this was a great opportunity to use her platform and say listen Republicans we can't have things as closed although we're going to celebrate a victory maybe we need to make sure we get up this boat thinking of getting out the vote the thing that jumped out at me Michelle looking at these results last night it was the suburbs it was right it was in Columbus in immediately outside of it O'Connor won 65% of the vote and had astronomical term if you just looked at that part of the district he said it's over the Democrat wins there was a lot of rural support for the Republican but that told me the enthusiasm is on the Democratic side here right and I've seen it all over the country you know you every single place I've been in this country over the last year and a half you meet these women who had always voted before but had never canvassed you know who now I've met women who back at work to devote themselves to anti-trump activism I mean people who wake up in the morning and think what can I do to flip this district you know whose husband's kind of barely recognize them and you can see it in the numbers right you can see the complete collapse of college-educated white women in the Republican Party they're also underwater now with college-educated white men although less so and I mean there I think there are people all over this country who would crawl and over broken glass that's a vote against that is that the message for the Democrat Party just anti-trump I don't think it has to be the message and I don't think that I think most of these candidates have most these candidates don't even have to talk about Trump that much because it's implicit the candidates are out there talking about health care or talking about higher minimum wages talking about economic issues and they barely need to mention Trump because there's all of these activists out there for whom it's implicit well in speaking of mentioning Trump that that name did happen to come up last night at the Republican they said it's a victory celebration they're claiming a victory treybal derson had a plenty of gratitude to go around let's listen to what he said I'd like to thank President Trump I'd also like to take the time to thank vice president pence there's many others I could just keep going on and on over the next three months I'm going to do everything I can to keep America great again notably there though ball derson did not think the governor of Ohio the former congressman from that district John Kasich who came through with a key endorsement of ball derson late in that campaign but of course Kasich criticized the decision of Trump to come in there and campaign at the end and in Phillip let me bring you in on that the president trying to take credit for this the role he's gonna be playing when we get into September October very early November how active is he going to be going into these districts Steve he wants to be very active the White House advisors that I've talked to in recent weeks say the president's hungry to get out there he wants to play in all these races there's a clear effort by his advisers as well as by the congressional leaders to keep him focused on places where he adds value on the trail go to some of those those red states with with Senate races like Montana like North Dakota like West Virginia get him to West Virginia all the time but they don't really want in campaigning in some of these suburban districts the president on the other hand thinks that he's added value anywhere he goes he wants to be out there he wants these Republican candidates to run under his banner he wants the midterms to be about him and I think he's going to be active both on the trail but also you know expressing his thoughts on Twitter about these campaigns as they heat up in Phillip in terms of Republicans the Republicans there in DC trying to save the house have they come up with any kind of a strategy for how they're gonna integrate Trump into their effort how they're gonna sort of just deal with the volatility of what's he gonna tweet this morning well they can't control what he's kind of tweet I think they wish they could and they definitely can't look they're gonna try to find some places where he can go they're actually using vice president Pence a lot on the House races he's see for months now has been doing a lot of campaigning in some of these House districts as well as raising money for some of the House candidates and some of the other other groups but look the president is going to go where he wants to go he wants to be campaigning and I think the White House is trying to keep him focused on the Senate Michelle I mean there's the school of thought and I tend to subscribe to it that when you're the opposition party in the midterm you almost don't need a message the message is just hey if you have any issue with the president use us as a check use this as a vehicle I'm looking at that pattern and we get some numbers will show later though with such concentrated Democratic strength right there around Columbus is there a longer term issue for Democrats here that support just being too concentrated around you know cities in an immediate metro areas well I think that it's you know because it's not just metro areas right it's also Metro suburbs so if you start winning say the suburbs of like Houston and some of these other big cities that that's a governing majority right you can kind of live without the hardest core rural areas I think that eventually there might be some tension in that you have because the opposition to Trump is so broad and it's kind of a big tense you know you have candidates in Orange County who are sort of fiscally conservative socially moderate then you have some of these economic populace in Michigan for example that might cause tension later on but I think that those things about those are luxury problems to have a party that's too big and that stuff can be resolved in time after the midterms hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
