1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,936
-- 

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,938
>>> WE WILL BREAK INTO THAT 

3
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,506
STORY TO BRING YOU SECRETARY OF 

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:10,443
STATE MIKE POMPEO SPEAKING 

5
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:10,743
RIGHT NOW. 

6
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:11,144
LET'S DIP IN. 

7
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,480
>> COUNTERPARTS, WE MADE CLEAR 

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,614
TO THEM THAT WE TAKE THIS 

9
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:21,721
MATTER WITH RESPECT TO JAMAL 

10
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:22,389
KHASHOGGI VERY SERIOUSLY. 

11
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,623
THEY MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY 

12
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,423
UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUS NATURE 

13
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:26,292
OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF  JAMAL 

14
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:26,592
KHASHOGGI. 

15
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:27,694
THEY ASSURED ME THAT THEY WILL 

16
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,095
CONDUCT A COMPLETE AND THOROUGH 

17
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,264
INVESTIGATION OF ALL OF THE 

18
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:34,634
FACTS SURROUNDING JAMAL 

19
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:35,835
KHASHOGGI AND THEY WILL DO SO 

20
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:38,371
IN A TIMELY FASHION AND  THE 

21
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,205
REPORT WILL BE TRANSPARENT FOR 

22
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,273
EVERYONE TO SEE AND ASK 

23
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,808
QUESTIONS ABOUT AND TO INQUIRE 

24
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:46,279
WITH RESPECT TO ITS 

25
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:46,679
THOROUGHNESS. 

26
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:47,814
I TOLD PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT WE 

27
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,315
OUGHT TO GIVE THEM A FEW MORE 

28
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,917
DAYS TO COMPLETE THAT SO THAT 

29
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,585
WE TO COULD HAVE A COMPLETE 

30
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:53,586
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTS 

31
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,521
SURROUNDING THAT AT WHICH POINT 

32
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,089
WE COULD TAKE DECISIONS ABOUT 

33
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,793
HOW TO RESPOND TO THE INCIDENTS 

34
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,429
SURROUNDING JAMAL KHASHOGGI.  

35
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,631
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO THAT 

36
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:06,832
WE HAVE A LONG STRATEGIC 

37
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:07,667
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KINGDOM 

38
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,535
OF SAUDI ARABIA. 

39
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:13,406
THEY CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT 

40
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,140
COUNTERTERRORISM PARTNERS AND 

41
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,141
THEY HAVE CUSTODY OF THE TWO 

42
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,042
HOLY SITES. 

43
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:20,513
THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC 

44
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:21,681
ALLIANCE AND WE NEED TO BE 

45
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:22,649
MINDFUL OF THAT AS WELL. 

46
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,586
WHEN I TRAVELED AND MET WITH 

47
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,255
THE TURKISH PRESIDENT, THEY 

48
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,457
TOLD ME ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND 

49
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,824
SAID THEY WERE CONDUCTING THEIR 

50
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,259
ON INVESTIGATION. 

51
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,727
WE HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH 

52
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:35,929
SOME OF THE TEAM INVOLVED WITH 

53
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,129
THAT. 

54
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,297
HE ASSURED ME THAT THEY WOULD 

55
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,433
SHARE THE RESULTS WITH THE 

56
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,167
SAUDI GOVERNMENT AS WELL. 

57
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,002
WE BELIEVE THAT BETWEEN THE TWO 

58
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:48,241
EFFORTS, COMPLETE PICTURE WILL 

59
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,108
EMERGE FOR WHAT ACTUALLY 

60
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:49,408
TRANSPIRED. 

61
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:50,476
WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS THAT AND 

62
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:51,477
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT 

63
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:52,812
WRAPPING UP QUICKLY AND WE 

64
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,547
EXPECT IT WILL BE DONE IN THAT 

65
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,148
WAY. 

66
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,182
>> WHY SHOULD SAUDI ARABIA BE 

67
00:01:57,182 --> 00:02:00,720
TRUSTED WHEN THEY ARE ACCUSED 

68
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,661
OF THE DISAPPEARANCE? 

69
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,229
>> WE WILL ALL GET TO SEE THE 

70
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,630
WORK BROUGHT. 

71
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,931
WE WILL SEE THE RESPONSE THAT 

72
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,500
THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA 

73
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,537
TAKES WITH US. 

74
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,005
WHEN WE SEE THAT, WE WILL ALL 

75
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,240
GET A CHANCE TO MAKE A 

76
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,040
DETERMINATION WITH RESPECT TO 

77
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,041
THE CREDIBILITY AND WORK THAT 

78
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:22,642
WENT INTO THAT. 

79
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,710
WHETHER IT IS TRULY ACCURATE 

80
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,278
AND FAIR OR TRANSPARENT IN THE 

81
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,112
WAY THEY MADE A COMMITMENT TO 

82
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,046
ME AND THE CROWN PRINCE 

83
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,148
MEDICAMENT TO THE PRESIDENT I 

84
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,716
BELIEVE IT WAS THE LATE -- THE 

85
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,150
NIGHT BEFORE LAST. 

86
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,153
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF STORIES 

87
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:38,258
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. 

88
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,492
>> THERE ARE LOTS OF -- 

89
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,726
>> CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING? 

90
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:41,894
>> THERE ARE LOTS OF STORIES 

91
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:42,562
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. 

92
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,896
WE ARE JUST GOING TO ALLOW THE 

93
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:47,800
PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD. 

94
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,102
ALLOW THE FACTS TO UNFOLD AND 

95
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,503
AS THEY UNFOLD AND WE MAKE A 

96
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,204
DETERMINATION FOR OURSELVES 

97
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,105
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BASED ON 

98
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,039
THE FACTS THAT ARE PRESENTED, 

99
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,940
THE UNITED STATES WILL 

100
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,807
DETERMINE WHAT THE APPROPRIATE 

101
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,375
RESPONSE MAY BE. 

102
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,644
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME 

103
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,146
TODAY. 

104
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,081
>> JUST HEARING FROM THE 

105
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,151
SECRETARY OF STATE, IT WAS A 

106
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,452
PRETTY BRIEF MEETING WITH THE 

107
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,689
PRESS TO BRING US UP TO SPEED 

108
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,324
AFTER HIS TRIP TO SAUDI ARABIA, 

109
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,159
AND TURKEY. 

110
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,128
AND WE HEARD HE GOT A PERSONAL 

111
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:20,599
COMMITMENT FROM SAUDI ARABIA 

112
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,601
THAT THERE WOULD BE A THOROUGH 

113
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,335
INVESTIGATION AND THE REPORT 

114
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,569
WOULD BE TRANSPARENT AND WE 

115
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:24,537
WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WENT ON 

116
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,938
AS THEY SEARCH TO GET TO THE 

117
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,874
BOTTOM OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS 

118
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,811
SAUDI JOURNALIST WAS MURDERED 

119
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,079
INSIDE A SAUDI CONSULATE IN 

120
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:42,488
ISTANBUL. 

121
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,823
>> TWO KEY POINTS CAME OUT, ONE 

122
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,425
IS THAT HE IS SAYING THAT THE 

123
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,459
U.S. WANTS TO GIVE SAUDI ARABIA 

124
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,994
A FEW MORE DAYS, A FEW MORE 

125
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,329
DAYS FOR THEM TO COMPLETE THEIR 

126
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:49,996
INVESTIGATION AND PRESENT THEIR 

127
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,231
SIDE OF THE STORY AND ONLY 

128
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,198
UNTIL THEY PRESENT THEIR SIDE 

129
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:57,170
OF THE STORY WILL THE UNITED 

130
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,137
STATES DECIDE HOW IT WILL 

131
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:58,403
RESPOND. 

132
00:03:58,403 --> 00:03:59,372
THEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE 

133
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,673
MADE THE POINT TO SAY THAT THE 

134
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:01,708
UNITED STATES HAS AN IMPORTANT 

135
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,609
STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH SAUDI 

136
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,743
ARABIA DATING BACK DECADES AND 

137
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,880
THAT THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED 

138
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,048
AND PUT INTO CONTEXT AS WELL. 

139
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,151
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ARMS 

140
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,086
DEAL AND INFLUENCING THE REGION 

141
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,120
AND TALKING ABOUT HELPING IN 

142
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,757
IRAQ AND YEMEN. 

143
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:19,992
THE SECRETARY OF STATE WAS KEEN 

144
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:21,594
TO MAKE THAT POINT AS HE WAS 

145
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:26,899
NOT READY TO MAKE TOO MANY 

146
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:27,166
DETAILS. 

147
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,435
>> HE TALKED ABOUT HIS TRIP TO 

148
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:33,273
TURKEY AND HE SPOKE TO THE 

149
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,207
PRESIDENT, AND THE TURKISH 

150
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:34,941
OFFICIALS ARE INVESTIGATING 

151
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,408
THIS AS WELL. 

152
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,277
IT HAPPENED IN TURKEY ALTHOUGH 

153
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:39,379
IT HAPPENED IN THE SAUDI 

154
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,113
CONSULATE. 

155
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,147
IT MEANS THAT TURKISH 

156
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,482
AUTHORITIES HAVE A LOT OF 

157
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:48,488
LEEWAY TO INVESTIGATE THIS. 

158
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,288
THEY ARE REALLY THE LEAD 

159
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:50,456
INVESTIGATIVE FORCE, AND SO HE 

160
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,591
ALSO SAID THAT WHEN HE TALKED 

161
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,859
TO THE PRESIDENT, HE MET WITH 

162
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:53,493
MEMBERS OF THE INVESTIGATIVE 

163
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,228
TEAM AND THEY SAID THAT THEY 

164
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,729
WOULD SHARE THE OUTCOMES OF THE 

165
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,464
INVESTIGATION WITH SAUDI 

166
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:58,765
ARABIA. 

167
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:04,604
THE HOPES ARE THAT WITH TWO OF 

168
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,571
THE INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON AND 

169
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,572
ALL OF THE INFORMATION BEING 

170
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,507
MADE TRANSPARENT, SOMEHOW, WE 

171
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,175
WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT 

172
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:15,348
HAPPENED. 

173
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,150
>> HE SAID GIVE IT A FEW MORE 

174
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,350
DAYS. 

175
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,351
>> WE HAVE A GREAT DISCUSSION 

176
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,786
WITH AN EXPERT IN THIS AREA TO 

177
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,020
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF WHAT 

178
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,321
IS TURNING OUT TO BE A LITTLE 

179
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,423
BIT OF A POLITICAL CRISIS 

180
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,223
BETWEEN THE THREE COUNTRIES. 

181
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,725
AND A LITTLE BIT MORE 

182
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,729
INFORMATION ABOUT JAMAL 

183
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,298
KHASHOGGI, JUST WHO HE WAS AND  

184
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,766
WHY HE WOULD BE ON THE RADAR 

185
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,201
FOR THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT AND 

186
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,836
WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT TO KILL 

187
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,605
HIM. 

188
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,907
>> EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR THE 

189
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:41,507
TANGIBLE EVIDENCE THAT 

190
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,642
DETERMINES WHAT HAPPENED TO 

191
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:42,942
HIM. 

192
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,410
>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 

193
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,278

WE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH 

197
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:47,393
CONGRESSMAN MARINO. 

198
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,928
>> THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT IS 

199
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,528
OUT OF CONTROL. 

200
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,563
IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW, 

201
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,063
PEOPLE DIE. 

202
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,465

WE ARE GOING TO TAKE IT VERY 

208
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:03,209
SERIOUSLY. 

209
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,243
>> THEY ARE JUST DRUG DEALERS 

210
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,211
AND LAB COATS. 

211
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,146

236
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,726

SAUDI CONSULATE 16 DAYS AGO,  

238
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:58,998
BUT SOME REPORTS SUGGESTED HIS 

239
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,532

SAUDI ARABIA'S CROWN PRINCE IS 

250
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,453
CULPABLE IN KHASHOGGI'S 

251
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:20,820

GRISLY NEW DETAILS ABOUT THAT

00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:44,543
AUDIO RECORDING THAT TURKISH

KHASHOGGI WAS TORTURED AND HIS 

268
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:55,888
BODY LATER DISMEMBERED.  

269
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,056

TO KHASHOGGI WILL EMERGE.  

275
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,000
>> GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. 

276
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,438
I HAD A CHANCE TO BRIEF THE 

277
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,339
PRESIDENT ON THE TRAVEL I

00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,882
RIYADH WITH THE KING, WITH THE 

281
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:23,816
CROWN PRINCE, WITH THE FOREIGN

ALL OF THE UNITED STATES 

284
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:29,789
COUNTERPARTS THERE. 

285
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,523
WE MADE CLEAR TO THEM THAT WE 

286
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:32,458
TAKE THIS MATTER, WITH RESPECT 

287
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,626
TO MISTER KHASHOGGI, VERY 

288
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,094
SERIOUSLY.  

289
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,796
THEY MADE IT CLEAR TO ME THAT 

290
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:37,930
THEY, TOO, UNDERSTAND THE 

291
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:42,234
SERIOUS NATURE OF THE 

292
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,035
DISAPPEARANCE OF MISTER 

293
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:43,335
KHASHOGGI. 

294
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,036
THEY ASSURED ME THEY WILL 

295
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,437
CONDUCT A COMPLETE AND THOROUGH 

296
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:47,206
INVESTIGATION  OF ALL OF THE 

297
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:47,739
FACTS SURROUNDING MISTER 

298
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:51,744
KHASHOGGI AND DO SO  IN A 

299
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,845
TIMELY FASHION AND THAT THIS 

300
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:53,479
REPORT ITSELF WILL BE 

301
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,180
TRANSPARENT FOR EVERYONE TO 

302
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,015
SEE, TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT AND 

303
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:02,087
TO INQUIRE. WITH RESPECT TO 

304
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:02,888
FAIRNESS, I TOLD PRESIDENT 

305
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,823
TRUMP THIS MORNING THAT WE 

306
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,224
OUGHT TO GIVE THEM A FEW MORE 

307
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,358
DAYS TO COMPLETE THAT, SO WE 

308
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,960
HAVE A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING 

309
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:15,334
OF THE FACTS,  AT WHICH POINT 

310
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,069
WE CAN MAKE A DECISION HOW OR 

311
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:17,736
IF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD 

312
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,537
RESPOND TO THE INCIDENT 

313
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,171
SURROUNDING MISTER KHASHOGGI. 

314
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,973
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT  FOR US 

315
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,641
ALL TO REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE A 

316
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,609
LONG, SINCE 1932, LONG 

317
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,643
STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 

318
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,680
KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA. 

319
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,914
THEY HAVE CUSTODY OF THE TWO 

320
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,415
HOLY SITES. 

321
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,986
THEY ARE A IMPORTANT -- THEY 

322
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:34,987
ARE AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC ALLY 

323
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,821
AND WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF 

324
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:39,058
THAT. 

325
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,092
WHEN I TRAVELED AND MET WITH 

326
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,160
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN, HE TALKED TO 

327
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,731
ME ABOUT THE INCIDENT.  

328
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:46,899
HE TOLD ME THEY WERE CONDUCTING 

329
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,499
THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION. 

330
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:48,968
WE HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH 

331
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,536
SOME OF THE TEAM INVOLVED WITH 

332
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:54,506
THAT. 

333
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:55,841
HE ASSURED ME THAT THEY WOULD 

334
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:56,909
SHARE THEIR RESULTS WITH THE 

335
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:57,342
SAUDIS AS WELL. 

336
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,044
WE DO BELIEVE THAT THROUGH 

337
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:04,249
THESE TWO EFFORTS, A COMPLETE 

338
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,251
PICTURE WILL EMERGE OF WHAT 

339
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:05,718
ACTUALLY TRANSPIRED. 

340
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,685
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT 

341
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,820
WRAPPING UP QUICKLY AND WE 

342
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,121
EXPECT ITWILL BE DONE IN THAT 

343
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,521
WAY. 

344
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:09,821
YES SIR. 

345
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:10,756
>> WHY SHOULD THE SAUDI 

346
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:14,627
ARABIANS BE TRUSTED? 

347
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,662
>> WE ARE ALL GOING TO GET TO 

348
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:22,268
SEE THE WORK PRODUCT. 

349
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,569
WE WILL ALL GET TO SEE THE 

350
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,204
RESPONSE THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI 

351
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:29,141
ARABIA TAKES. 

352
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,643
WHEN WE SEE THAT, ALL OF US 

353
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,077
WILL GET A CHANCE TO MAKE A 

354
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:32,711
DETERMINATION WITH RESPECT TO 

355
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,712
THE CREDIBILITY AND WORK THAT 

356
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:34,313
WENT INTO THAT. 

357
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,749
WHETHER IT IS FAIR AND 

358
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,816
TRANSPARENT IN THE WAY THEY 

359
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,084
MADE A PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO 

360
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,452
ME AND THE CROWN PRINCE ALSO 

361
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,522
MADE A PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO 

362
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,490
THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE SPOKE TO 

363
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,225
HIM, I BELIEVE THE NIGHT BEFORE 

364
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,126
LAST. 

365
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,861
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF STORIES 

366
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:50,562
OUT RIGHT NOW ABOUT WHAT 

367
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:50,829
HAPPENED. 

368
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,132
CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING? 

369
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,800
>> THERE ARE LOTS OF STORIES 

370
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,434
OUT THERE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. 

371
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,571
WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE 

372
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,505
PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD. 

373
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,073
ALLOWING THE FAXED ONE FOLD. 

374
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,543
AS THEY UNFOLD, AS WE MAKE A 

375
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,210
DETERMINATION FOR OURSELVES ON 

376
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,745
WHAT HAPPENED, THE UNITED 

377
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,248
STATES WILL DETERMINE WHAT THE 

378
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,182
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE WILL BE. 

379
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,717
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME 

380
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,719
TODAY. 

381
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:18,390
>>> MUSTAPHA IS A SENIOR FELLOW 

382
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,925
AT THE CATO INSTITUTE AND JOINS 

383
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,660
US NOW VIA WEBCAM FROM 

384
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:21,960
WASHINGTON. 

385
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:30,703
I WANT TO GET YOUR SENSE OF 

386
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,603
THESE REPORTS THAT ARE EMERGING 

387
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:33,105
THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A 

388
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:33,739
MUTUALLY AGREEABLE DEFINITION 

389
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,541
OF WHAT HAPPENED TO KHASHOGGI 

390
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,242
THAT DOES NOT IMPLICATE THE 

391
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:40,145
CROWN PRINCE.  

392
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,547
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT AND 

393
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,683
WHAT MIGHT THIS MIDDLEGROUND BE?

394
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,052
>> TRUTH SHOULD BE ABOUT 

395
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:52,324
POLITICS -- SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT 

396
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:52,591
POLITICS. 

397
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,593
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN WHAT 

398
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:58,430
HAPPENED. 

399
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,631
THE ROGUE ELEMENT GOES ALL THE 

400
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:04,003
WAY UP TO THE CROWN PRINCE. 

401
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:04,903
IF THERE IS A POLITICAL 

402
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:05,537
SOLUTION, WHITEWASHING THE 

403
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:12,211
POPLE AT THE TOP AND FINDING 

404
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,545
BLAME AT THE LOWER LEVELS, THAT 

405
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:20,552
WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY MANY 

406
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:20,785
PEOPLE. 

407
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:21,987
I THINK THE U.S. SHOULD SEARCH 

408
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:22,588
FOR THE TRUTH. 

409
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:27,659
>> TURKEY HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVE, 

410
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,094
AT LEAST IT LOOKS LIKE THEY 

411
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:29,895
HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE WITH THIS 

412
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:30,262
INVESTIGATION. 

413
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,130
THEY HAVE SEARCHED THE SAUDI 

414
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,530
CONSULATE. 

415
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,431
THEY SEARCHED THE SAUDI 

416
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:32,931
COUNSEL'S RESIDENCE. 

417
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:37,136
A LOT OF THE GRUESOME DETAILS 

418
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,604
WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE CASE 

419
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,508
OR THE ALLEGATIONS ANYWAY HAVE 

420
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,509
COME FROM THE TURKISH SIDE. 

421
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:48,280
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON TURKEY AND 

422
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,315
HOW AGGRESSIVE THE EFFORTS ARE? 

423
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,416
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE SINCERE 

424
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,051
AND WANT TO GET TO THE TRUTH? 

425
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,386
>> I THINK THEY WANT TO. 

426
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:57,356
TURKEY IS NOT A BEACON OF PRESS 

427
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,024
FREEDOM. 

428
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:02,828
BUT JAMAL KHASHOGGI WAS SOMEONE 

429
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,129
WHO HAD GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE 

430
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,400
CURRENT  LEADERS IN TURKEY. 

431
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,568
SO I THINK THEY FEEL FOR HIM 

432
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:13,806
AND THEY FEEL THAT THIS WAS ONE 

433
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,974
OF THEIRS THAT THE SAUDI'S 

434
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,207
KILLED. 

435
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,042
PLUS THERE ARE BIG TENSIONS 

436
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,478
BETWEEN TURKEY AND SAUDI ARABIA 

437
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,079
ON VARIOUS ISSUES. 

438
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,849
I THINK TURKEY IS SINCERE. 

439
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:24,850
THEY HAVE TO DO ONE THING. 

440
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,218
THEY CLAIM TO HAVE THIS 

441
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,821
AUDIOTAPE. 

442
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,255
THEY HAVE TO AT LEAST SHOW IT 

443
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:30,856
TO SOME PEOPLE. 

444
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,057
THEY SHOULD SHOW IT TO 

445
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,759
WASHINGTON POST, U.S. OFFICIALS

446
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,026
, OR OTHER PEOPLE, THIRD 

447
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:38,864
PARTIES THE WORLD CAN TRUST. 

448
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:39,998
UNTIL THEY DO THAT, THERE WILL 

449
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:40,832
BE SOME QUESTION MARKS. 

450
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:46,572
UNTIL THEN, IT IS CLEAR THAT 

451
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,306
THEY DID DO SOMETHING TERRIBLE 

452
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,007
TO JAMAL KHASHOGGI. 

453
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:53,045
THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE 

454
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,813
SAUDI'S.  

455
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,248
IF HE WAS LOST IN THE MIDDLE OF 

456
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,449
THE STREET, THEY WOULD BE 

457
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,083
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY, 

458
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,585
BUT HE WAS LOST IN A SAUDI 

459
00:16:59,585 --> 00:16:59,885
CONSULATE. 

460
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,220
IT IS CLEAR AND PROVEN THAT A 

461
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,056
TEAM CAME TO ARREST HIM. 

462
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,190
WHAT EXACTLY DID THEY DO TO 

463
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,590
HIM? 

464
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,791
STILL UNCLEAR, BUT IT IS CLEAR 

465
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,027
THAT THERE WAS A CRIME 

466
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:09,728
COMMITTED AGAINST A PROMINENT 

467
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,230
SAUDI JOURNALIST BY HIS OWN 

468
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,732
COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT. 

469
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:14,967
>> DESPITE THAT, IT HAS BEEN 

470
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,734
MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AND THE 

471
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:19,805
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS 

472
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:20,606
EFFECTIVELY SAID THEY ARE 

473
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,240
RELUCTANT TO TERMINATE THE 

474
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,241
<font color="#00FF00"><u>URRENT ARMS DEAL AND THERE </u></font>

475
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,976
REALLY HASN'T BEEN MUCH SAID 

476
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:24,777
ABOUT THE PROTECTIONS OF 

477
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,877
JOURNALISM AND PRESS FREEDOM. 

478
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:33,518
WHEN YOU READ JAMAL KHASHOGGI'S 

479
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:34,620
FINAL, WHAT WE EXPECT TO BE 

480
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,554
FINAL, OP-ED IN THE WASHINGTON 

481
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:43,562
POST,  HE PROMOTES THE FREE 

482
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,396
JOURNALISTIC PURSUIT IN ARAB 

483
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:44,629
STATES. 

484
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:45,597
I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK THE 

485
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,832
IMPACT IS ALREADY BEEN AS FAR 

486
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,733
AS THE INTERNATIONAL STANDING 

487
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,102
OF THE U.S. SEND THIS ALMOST 

488
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,403
SILENCE ON WHAT WE ALL BELIEVE 

489
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,404
HAPPENED OR FEEL IS MOST 

490
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:52,637
LIKELY? 

491
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:58,010
>> IT HAS NOT BEEN GOOD. 

492
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,511
WE ALL KNOW THAT THE U.S. HAS 

493
00:17:59,511 --> 00:17:59,944
BUSINESS INTERESTS. 

494
00:17:59,944 --> 00:18:01,079
EVERY COUNTRY HAS THOSE 

495
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,582
INTEREST. 

496
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,883
BUT IF THAT IS THE ONLY THING 

497
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,118
WERE THE FIRST THING THAT COMES 

498
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,519
TO YOUR MIND AND THE THING THAT 

499
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,054
YOU EMPHASIZE MOST, THEN PEOPLE 

500
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:15,360
WHO HAVE REALLY COMMITTED CRIME 

501
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,495
WILL SAY, OKAY, THE U.S. WILL 

502
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,162
TOLERATE US. 

503
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,563
SO EVERY COUNTRY HAS TO THINK 

504
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:20,199
ABOUT STRATEGIC INTERESTS AND 

505
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,402
SO ON AND SO FORTH. 

506
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,836
>> DO YOU THINK THE CROWN 

507
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:26,037
PRINCE HAD THAT IN HIS 

508
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:30,275
CALCULATION IF HE IS FOUND OUT 

509
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,076
TO BE BEHIND THIS? 

510
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:31,910
THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

511
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,778
WOULD DEAL? 

512
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,181
>> I THINK THE GOOD IMAGE HE 

513
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,518
CREATED IN THE WEST WITH 

514
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,552
COSMETIC REFORMS, THOSE ARE 

515
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,653
GOOD REFORMS, BUT HE DID THIS 

516
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,088
TO WIN SOME BROWNIE POINTS IN 

517
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,323
THE U.S. AND GET MORE POWER AT 

518
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,057
HOME. 

519
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,860
I THINK HE RELIED ON THOSE 

520
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,961
THINGS AND THOUGHT THIS WOULD 

521
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,662
NOT BACKFIRE THIS MONTH. 

522
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,029
-- THIS MUCH. 

523
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:56,535
HE IS OBVIOUSLY CALCULATING. 

524
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,536
IT DIDN'T WORK FOR HIM, EITHER. 

525
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,472
I THINK THE U.S. GOVERNMENT 

526
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,207
SHOULD DO A BETTER JOB OF 

527
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:10,415
STANDING TOUGH ON THIS ISSUE. 

528
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,383
AS OTHER COMPANIES AND 

529
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,351
NEWSPAPERS HAVE DONE BY PULLING 

530
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,352
OUT OF THIS BIG MEETING AND 

531
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,252
SAUDI ARABIA. 

532
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:15,854
>> THE CROWN PRINCE, LIKE YOU 

533
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,022
MENTIONED, HAS CREATED AN 

534
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:23,295
IMPRESSION OF BEING A 

535
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:23,896
PROGRESSIVE PERSON. 

536
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:24,730
WE HAVE SEEN HIM LIFT 

537
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,734
RESTRICTIONS, BUT WE HAVE ALSO 

538
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,035
SEEN HOW HEAVY-HANDED HE CAN 

539
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:30,335
BE. 

540
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,370
WE HAVE SEEN HIM IMPRISONED 

541
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,437
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN FAMILY IN 

542
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,807
THE RITZ HOTEL. 

543
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,009
WE SAW HIM CREATE A DIPLOMATIC 

544
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,310
SPAT OVER A TWEET FROM A 

545
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,077
CANADIAN OFFICIAL. 

546
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,780
OF COURSE, WHAT IS GOING ON IN 

547
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,914
YEMEN AND THE BLOCKADE. 

548
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:44,249
WE KNOW HE CAN BE HEAVY-HANDED. 

549
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,651
ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE BEEN 

550
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:50,022
WONDERING, WHY CHOOSE JAMAL 

551
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:50,322
KHASHOGGI? 

552
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,323
THERE ARE OTHER CRITICS OF THE 

553
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,091
ROYAL FAMILY AND THE 

554
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,093
GOVERNMENT.  

555
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,728
WHY DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE 

556
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,429
CHOSEN TO BE MURDERED, IF 

557
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,230
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED? 

558
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:04,169
>> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK IT IS 

559
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,137
NOT ONLY JAMAL KHASHOGGI THAT 

560
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,705
HE AND HIS PEOPLE ARE GOING 

561
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:06,938
AFTER. 

562
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:11,944
TODAY THE WASHINGTON POST  

563
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:12,678
PUBLISHED AN INTERESTING STORY. 

564
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,979
A SAUDI IN CANADA WAS VISITED 

565
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,080
BY OFFICIALS AND SAID COME BACK 

566
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,914
HOME, OTHERWISE YOUR FAMILY 

567
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,150
WOULD BE IN DANGER. 

568
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,584
THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS TO 

569
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:20,419
OTHER DISSIDENTS. 

570
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:25,257
BUT I THINK JAMAL KHASHOGGI WAS 

571
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,091
IMPORTANT FOR TWO THINGS. 

572
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,592
HE WAS THE MOST VOCAL ONE, 

573
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:29,228
WRITING IN THE WASHINGTON POST. 

574
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,529
THE VERY CIRCLES THAT THE 

575
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,530
PRINCE WANTED TO IMPRESS AND 

576
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,465
MAKE FRIENDS OUT OF. 

577
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:33,999
THAT IS ONE THING. 

578
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,400
SECONDLY, PEOPLE LIKE JAMAL 

579
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,906
KHASHOGGI  WHO ARE NOT OUTRIGHT 

580
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,707
ENEMIES AND FANATIC, EXTREME 

581
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,342
VOICES, BUT WHO ARE ACTUALLY 

582
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,577
QUITE MAINSTREAM AND HAVE A 

583
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,478
FOLLOWING AND RESPECT AMONG THE 

584
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,412
MAINSTREAM PEOPLE, THAT IS A 

585
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,213
BIGGER PROBLEM FOR THE 

586
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:53,752
DICTATORS, BECAUSE THAT 

587
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,920
DISTURBS THE NARRATIVE THEY AIM 

588
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,220
TO CREATE. 

589
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,622
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY MEANT TO 

590
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,991
KILL HIM RIGHT AWAY, BUT 

591
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:00,692
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED. 

592
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,027
IT IS VERY PROBABLE HE LOST HIS 

593
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,395
LIFE AT THIS POINT, THE VERY 

594
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:03,762
FIRST DAY. 

595
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,230
THIS IS SOMETHING THE WORLD 

596
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,698
SHOULD NOT LET GO AND SHOULD 

597
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,000
NOT BE FORGOTTEN AND THE U.S. 

598
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,301
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD TAKE A 

599
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,702
TOUGHER STANCE. 

600
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:15,107
>> RIGHT AFTER THIS HAPPENED, 

601
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,041
NOT RIGHT AFTER IT HAPPENED, 

602
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,775
BUT AFTER IT BECAME A NATIONAL 

603
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:22,247
STORY, I THOUGHT IT WAS 

604
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:22,580
INTERESTING. 

605
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,749
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS 

606
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:24,983
ON THE CROWN PRINCE AND THE 

607
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:29,254
DECISIONS HE HAS BEEN MAKING, 

608
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,655
BOTH THE PRESIDENTS OF THE U.S. 

609
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:31,289
AND TURKEY BOTH IMMEDIATELY 

610
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,657
TALKED ABOUT BEING IN CONTACT 

611
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:35,427
WITH THE KING, NOT THE CROWN 

612
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:35,727
PRINCE. 

613
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:36,762
DO YOU THINK THE CROWN PRINCES 

614
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:42,668
POSITION COULD BE IN JEOPARDY? 

615
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,902
>> THAT COULD BE A WAY OUT. 

616
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,504
HERE THERE IS NO LOGIC TO SAUDI 

617
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,304
ARABIA AS A WHOLE COUNTRY. 

618
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:52,611
THERE IS THIS YOUNG PRINCE WHO 

619
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,745
FOUND ABSOLUTE POWER AT THE AGE 

620
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:54,946
OF 33 AND IS APPARENTLY AN 

621
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:55,647
AMBITIOUS MAN AND GOT 

622
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,481
INTOXICATED BY ALL THAT. 

623
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,682
IT IS POSSIBLE HE ORDERED THIS, 

624
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,251
BUT HIS OLD, 82-YEAR-OLD FATHER 

625
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,352
THE KING, MAYBE HE HAS NOT 

626
00:22:01,352 --> 00:22:04,389
AWARE. 

627
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:08,660
-- MAYBE HE WAS NOT AWARE. 

628
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,461
NOW SOME ARE SUGGESTING THAT 

629
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,229
MAYBE THE KING COULD CHANGE THE 

630
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,266
CROWN PRINCE. 

631
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,400
HE COULD GO AND BE REPLACED. 

632
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,001
THIS IS POSSIBLE. 

633
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,035
MAYBE THAT IS WHAT THE 

634
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,203
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD 

635
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,039
PUSH FOR, ONCE IT IS PROVEN, 

636
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,707
AND IT IS VERY LIKELY AT THIS 

637
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:25,944
POINT, THAT THE CROWN PRINCE 

638
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,245
WAS BEHIND THIS TERRIBLE CRIME 

639
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,113
COMMITTED AGAINST JAMAL 

640
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,080
KHASHOGGI.  

641
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,182
>> WHAT YOU THINK IS THE MOST 

642
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,017
LIKELY OUTCOME AT THIS STAGE IF 

643
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,451
THE SAUDI'S STICK TO THEIR 

644
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,854
STORY? 

645
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,189
>> I THINK THE NEXT STEP WILL 

646
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,623
BE TURKEY EITHER FINDING BODY 

647
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,092
PARTS -- THEY ARE SEARCHING 

648
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:44,596
DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND TURKISH 

649
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,198
POLICE ARE SEARCHING A FARM 

650
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:52,637
OUTSIDE ISTANBUL, EITHER THAT, 

651
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:53,572
OR THEY SHOW THE TAPE TO 

652
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:58,410
CREDIBLE THIRD PARTIES. 

653
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,945
IN THAT CASE, IT WILL BE PROVEN 

654
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:00,946
THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED 

655
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,081
AND THEN GO ALL THE WAY UP THE 

656
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,216
SAUDI HIERARCHY AND PROVE THIS 

657
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,417
WAS THE ACT OF THE CROWN 

658
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:05,650
PRINCE. 

659
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,286
AFTER THAT, THE CROWN PRINCE 

660
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,588
SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTED AS A 

661
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:17,195
LEGITIMATE ACTOR. 

662
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,530
LIKE THE U.S. SAID TO OTHER 

663
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,364
DICTATORS, THIS GUY SHOULD GO. 

664
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,365
I AM HAPPY LINDSEY GRAHAM 

665
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,600
ALREADY SAID THAT AND I THINK 

666
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,301
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE IN WESTERN 

667
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,069
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD TAKE THAT 

668
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,070
STANCE, ONCE IT BECOMES PROVEN 

669
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,671
AND I THINK IT WILL BE, IN THE 

670
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,839
DAYS AHEAD. 

671
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,408
>> TURKISH OFFICIALS SAY THEIR 

672
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,675
INVESTIGATION WILL BE WRAPPING 

673
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,345
UP SOON. 

674
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,579
MUSTAFA AKYOL, THANK YOU FOR 

675
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,515

ALREADY SWOLLEN LAKES AND RIVERS

681
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:48,894
TO RECORD LEVELS. 

682
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,128

730
