00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,350
hi guys happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Earth Day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of an</font>

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,210
environmentalist maybe more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font>

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,010
maybe more so in college when I was

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,630
president of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> students for an</font>

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,540
environmentally active campus student

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,490
organization so I'm a big fan of Earth

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,220
Day<font color="#E5E5E5"> or earth week or earth month or just</font>

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,260
earth everything so today I want to talk

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,850
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things I'm doing it something</font>

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,980
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try just a little bit</font>

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,529
lighter on our planet by now things like

12
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,510
using reusable water bottles and

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,490
recycling have become pretty standard

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,529
although if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing them you</font>

15
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,090
showed now it's time to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,100
things just a step<font color="#CCCCCC"> further shall I kind</font>

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,870
of think our focus on recycling is kind

18
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,489
of to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the detriment of real progress</font>

19
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,649
because we feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we did</font>

20
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,840
something we're done but in the cycle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,660
reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> reuse recycle they kind of come</font>

22
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,210
in order of priority so recycling does

23
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,430
the least while we're using something is

24
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,350
even better and reducing is the best of

25
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">all so it's earth day I want to recommit</font>

26
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,120
myself to reducing in order to decrease

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,699
my environmental impact first I'm going

28
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">to reduce driving i drive to work</font>

29
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyday and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right now that's kind of my</font>

30
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,519
solution just because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">parking spot at home so it's like a</font>

32
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,930
place to put my car during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day but</font>

33
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,640
other than that I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

34
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,830
decrease my driving to pretty much zero

35
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,890
I'm lucky to live downtown where there's

36
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,509
a lot of stuff within walking distance

37
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,340
and now it's beautiful weather too so if

38
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">I ever need to buy anything or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

39
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,270
grocery shopping or even go visit my

40
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,850
parents who live maybe two miles three

41
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,979
miles<font color="#E5E5E5"> away I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and get</font>

42
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,680
there either by walking or biking number

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,960
two I need to cut down<font color="#CCCCCC"> on buying stuff</font>

44
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,119
which goes hand in hand with my kind of

45
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,860
minimalist bent I've been kind of on a

46
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,900
spree lately of shopping for stuff and

47
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,520
let me just<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you the results of that</font>

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
you come home with your shopping<font color="#E5E5E5"> bag</font>

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,440
tissue paper inside and

50
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,870
you get receipts and tags and things and

51
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,420
even worse is shopping online or like

52
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,520
three of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these little bag things from</font>

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,930
lush and they're pretty actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

54
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,460
about their environmental packaging but

55
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,310
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's wrapped in plastic and then</font>

56
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,710
you have the catalog and the packing

57
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,260
slip and the packing peanuts and the box

58
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,180
and you just multiply that out with

59
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,460
every package I received because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do a</font>

60
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,530
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my shopping online and that's a</font>

61
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,750
lot of waste not to mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the fuel</font>

62
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,310
it takes to ship it from one place to

63
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,950
another so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cool it with</font>

64
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,290
shopping online maybe I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to step</font>

65
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,380
back to light one order a month and even

66
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,610
that's going to be kind of tricky for me

67
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,740
but I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it I gotta focus and</font>

68
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,480
finally I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to try and reduce the</font>

69
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,850
waste associated with my food buying

70
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,730
fewer processed packaged foods so I

71
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,890
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw away all the boxes</font>

72
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,930
bags at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end and being realistic</font>

73
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,700
about how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> produce i'm going to use</font>

74
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,350
it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy fruit and vegetables</font>

75
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,610
but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> great for the environment</font>

76
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,380
when you end up throwing stuff away

77
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,480
because it's gone bad and now that the

78
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,280
farmers market has started back up for

79
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the summer buying more food locally</font>

80
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,650
which means awesome produce and honey

81
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,920
and cheese and bread and austin 2 gud

82
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,290
stuff that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> traveled a much shorter</font>

83
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,720
distance to get to me alright so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

84
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,760
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to step up and start</font>

85
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,620
reducing my environmental impact once

86
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,390
again tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me in the comments what you</font>

87
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,850
do to be environmentally friendly or how

88
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,950
you're celebrating Earth Day and I will

89
00:03:10,950 --> 00:00:00,000
see you tomorrow bye
