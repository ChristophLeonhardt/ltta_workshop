1
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,272

00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:12,475
NOW BEEN CAUGHT UP IN DEMOCRAT'S

3
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:14,044
WITCH-HUNT AND IT HAS COST HIM

4
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:16,111
DEALER AND PERSONALLY, MICHAEL

5
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:16,446
CAPUTO.

6
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:18,281
HE'S HAD TO SELL HIS HOME TO PAY

7
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:20,050
FOR LEGAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,552
THE RUSSIA PROBE AND HE'S NOW

9
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:23,853
FEARFUL THAT HIS KIDS' FUTURES

10
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:28,558
ARE IN JEOPARDY OVER THIS.

11
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:33,430
THIS WEEK CAPUTO HAD HARSH

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,797
WORDS.

13
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:35,865
WHAT AMERICA NEEDS IS AN

14
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:36,466
INVESTIGATION OF THE

15
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:36,900
INVESTIGATORS.

16
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,169
I WANT TO KNOW WHO WITH'S

17
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,037
SPAYING FOR THIS?

18
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:42,705
I WANT TO KNOW WHO COST US SO

19
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:44,674
MUCH MONEY, WHO CRUSHED OUR

20
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:46,910
KIDS, FORCED US OUT OF OUR HOME

21
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,311
ALL BECAUSE YOU LOST AN

22
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:48,778
ELECTION.

23
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:54,617
I WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE, WELL,

24
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:56,553
G-D YOU TO HELL.

25
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:57,620
MICHAEL CAPUTO JOINS US NOW.

26
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,622
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.

27
00:00:59,622 --> 00:01:01,324
YOU SAID WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

28
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:01,724
FEEL.

29
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:03,393
I SAID THIS TO RUDY GIULIANI THE

30
00:01:03,393 --> 00:01:05,595
OTHER NIGHT.

31
00:01:05,595 --> 00:01:07,831
I WATCHED FROM DAY ONE IN THE

32
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:09,232
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

33
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:11,501
I'M GUESSING -- I DON'T KNOW FOR

34
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:11,801
SURE.

35
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:13,269
SHE PROBABLY SPENT MORE LEGAL

36
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:14,237
FEES THAN SHE WAS PAID LAST

37
00:01:14,237 --> 00:01:14,537
YEAR.

38
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:16,773
AND I THINK THAT'S THE CASE FOR

39
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:18,174
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

40
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:20,176
EXPLAIN HOW THIS IMPACTS YOU AND

41
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:21,344
YOUR FAMILY.

42
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:23,113
>>  WELL, IT ALL STARTED --

43
00:01:23,113 --> 00:01:24,881
WELL, THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

44
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:27,717
BUT IT ALL STARTED ON MARCH 20TH

45
00:01:27,717 --> 00:01:31,687
OF 2017 WHEN THE HOUSE

46
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:33,189
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAD A

47
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:35,191
PUBLIC HEARING WHERE

48
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:36,025
REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE SPEIER

49
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:37,927
BROUGHT MY AND MY WIFE'S NAME UP

50
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:40,029
IN THE HEARING AND CALLED ME

51
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:41,564
PUTIN'S IMAGE MAKER.

52
00:01:41,564 --> 00:01:43,633
THE THREATS TO OUR FAMILY CAME

53
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:45,968
JUST ONE AFTER THE OTHER.

54
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:47,503
DEATH THREAT AFTER DEATH THREAT.

55
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:49,372
ONE GUY CALLED ME AFTER THAT

56
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:51,007
HEARING ON THE PHONE AND SAID,

57
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:52,742
"I KNOW YOU'RE NOT HOME.

58
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:54,010
WE'RE GOING TO BURN YOUR HOUSE

59
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,913
DOWN WITH YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN

60
00:01:56,913 --> 00:01:57,380
INSIDE."

61
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,781
THESE THREATS HAVEN'T STOPPED.

62
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:01,184
I HAD TO LAWYER UP WHEN IT

63
00:02:01,184 --> 00:02:03,152
BECAME CLEAR I WAS GOING TO BE

64
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:04,420
PULLED INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL

65
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:04,887
INVESTIGATIONS.

66
00:02:04,887 --> 00:02:06,889
AND SINCE THEN, AFTER A

67
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:07,990
COMMITTEE INTELLIGENCE HEARING

68
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,894
IN 2017 AND THEN A SENATE

69
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:13,830
COMMITTEE HEARING ON TUESDAY AND

70
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,631
NOW SITTING BEFORE THE MUELLER

71
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:17,533
TEAM ON WEDNESDAY, WE'RE AT

72
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:18,901
ABOUT $125,000.

73
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,870
I WANT TO TELL YOU, WE WERE ON

74
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,573
OUR WAY OUT OF OUR HOME, SEAN,

75
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:24,707
ON OUR WAY OUT BECAUSE WE

76
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:26,742
COULDN'T HAVE A HOME LIKE WE HAD

77
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:28,077
AND MAKE BUFFALO MONEY.

78
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:30,046
WE HAD TO MOVE TO WASHINGTON TO

79
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:31,480
MAKE WASHINGTON MONEY SO I COULD

80
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,151
PAY THE DEBT THAT I HAD -- THESE

81
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:37,486
$125,000 IS MORE THAN I MAKE IN

82
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:46,262
A YEAR HERE IN EAST  AURORA, NEW

83
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:46,796
YORK.

84
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:49,265
WE DON'T MAKE THAT MUCH OUT

85
00:02:49,265 --> 00:00:00,000
HERE.
