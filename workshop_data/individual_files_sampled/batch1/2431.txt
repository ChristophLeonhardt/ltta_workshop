my name is Maya gazelle I'm 18 years old and I'm from Damascus Syria I love Damascus when I was 15 years old in 2015 when I first arrived to the UK I arrived to Birmingham and I stayed there for two years in there I went to college and I found that that city it was very diverse it had different and many nationalities from all around the world with speaking different languages and having different cultures I wasn't the only one who was new in that country I wasn't the only one who was struggling in English and that really helped I met my friend and she's Ruthenian and she also like we started improving our English together and we helped each other at maths and we carried on like with our engineering course and until this point we still support each other in terms of people living in the UK I've never faced someone who wasn't opening for refugees I was lucky enough that everyone who I faced I talked to everyone was understanding they knew what our reasons and why we needed to leave it wasn't something that we chose to it wasn't something that we wanted really just to leave our country everything we've built our own language just to start from zero not many people want that not too many people are capable to do that really trying hard and we don't want to stay at home not work and just be lonely your employ lists it totally understands the haters equals it's just that maybe they don't see the bigger picture or maybe they do maybe they just don't see our picture or from our angle and point of view I have seen some not very nice comments around either being talking about my religion or being races or so but I just don't put myself down for them these comments give me more a push forward that well I need to prove them wrong and I need to prove them well I am somewhat that swarthy and I can be as good as the person who wrote that comment be for me I really want to be an example that well I do volunteer work and I really want to give something back to the community that will company to the place that put me into education into University some people has really achieved a lot and I really want to be considered as one of them later on
