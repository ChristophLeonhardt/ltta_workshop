EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE VICTIMS.

01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:17,772
AS THEY WALKED OUT THIS MORNING,

45
01:16:17,772 --> 01:16:18,406
THEY CAME OUT TO APPLAUSE.

THE COMMUNITY IS OUT HERE AS

01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:20,342

48
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:21,409
THEY WANTED TO LET THEM KNOW 

49
01:16:21,409 --> 01:16:22,644

WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS WHO SAY 

54
01:16:30,151 --> 01:16:31,720
THEY WANTED TO MAKE THEIR WAY 

55
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:32,954
OFF CAMPUS THINKING THEY WOULD

01:16:32,954 --> 01:16:35,457
GET BETTER EXPOSURE, GET THEIR 

57
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:37,592

THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS OUT HERE,

80
01:17:18,032 --> 01:17:18,700
MIX RIGHT THERE?

81
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:19,467
>> YES, HE IS. 

82
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:20,668
>> WHY DID YOU WANT TO BE OUT 

83
01:17:20,668 --> 01:17:21,570
HERE THIS MORNING?

84
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,738
>> BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A VERY 

85
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:24,940
EMOTIONAL TIME FOR ALL OF US AND

86
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,042
IT'S PART OF OUR HEALING AND I'M

01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:27,909
JUST SO PROUD OF THE STUDENTS 

88
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:30,578

01:17:30,578 --> 01:17:31,179
ACCOMPLISH IN CREATING CHANGE 

90
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:32,981
FOR GUN LAWS.

91
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,416
>> AND THAT'S THE BIG THING THAT

92
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,484
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO TODAY.

93
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,885
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN ONE BILL THAT

94
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:39,588
HAS BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR,

95
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:42,257
A GUN AND SCHOOL SAFETY BILL, 

96
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:42,891
BUT NOW THEY'RE LOOKING TO MAKE 

97
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:44,192
SOME MORE CHANGE.

98
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:44,993
SPECIFICALLY, WHAT HAVE YOU 

99
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,161

IT COMES TO THE RALLY TODAY?

101
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,298
>> WELL, HONESTLY, WE HAVEN'T 

102
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:51,232
SPOKEN TOO MUCH ABOUT THE RALLY 

103
01:17:51,232 --> 01:17:52,534
BUT HE IS SUPPORTIVE AND HE DOES

01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:54,369
WANT TO GO TO WASHINGTON TO 

105
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:54,636
PROTEST. 

106
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:56,037

01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:04,212
GOVERNOR DID SIGN ONE BILL, A 

113
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:05,446
GUN AND SCHOOL SAFETY BILL, BUT 

114
01:18:05,446 --> 01:18:06,848
THE KIDS ARE DEMANDING MORE GUN 

115
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:07,082
CONTROL.

116
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,617
THEY WANT AN ALL OUT BAN ON 

117
01:18:09,617 --> 01:18:11,886

DEFINITELY MAKE SCHOOLS SAFER.

157
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:11,179
WE CAN DEFINITELY CHANGE SOME OF

158
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:12,113
THE GUN LAWS AND MAKE THEM A 

159
01:19:12,113 --> 01:19:12,713
LITTLE MORE STRICT.

160
01:19:12,713 --> 01:19:13,915
THAT'S A BIG PUSH THAT WE NEED

>> YOU GUYS ARE MAKING A 

192
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:01,896
DIFFERENCE.

193
01:20:01,896 --> 01:20:03,965
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY OWN KIDS' 

194
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:04,332
SCHOOLS.

195
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:05,233
GOOD LUCK FOR THE REST OF THE 

196
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:05,399
DAY.

197
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:06,768
GO BACK OUT THERE WITH YOUR 

198
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:07,368

>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

200
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,704
>> THOSE STUDENTS IN PARKLAND 

201
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:11,539
TAKING THAT CALL FOR GUN CONTROL

202
01:20:11,539 --> 01:20:12,774
ALL THE WAY TO WASHINGTON WHERE 

203
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:17,879
IT APPEARS RIGHT NOW THAT ISSUE 

204
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:18,446
IS STALLED AND ON THE BACK 

205
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:18,679
BURNER.

206
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:20,148
LET'S GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE NOW 

207
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,751
WHERE THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS FROM

208
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:25,053
SCHOOLS IN THAT AREA ARE 

209
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,621
GATHERING OUTSIDE THE WHITE 

210
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:28,856
HOUSE TO PROTEST AND THAT'S 

211
01:20:28,856 --> 01:20:31,392
WHERE OUR DAVID KERLEY IS FOR A 

212
01:20:31,392 --> 01:20:33,628
MOMENT OF SILENCE AND THEN, 

213
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:35,863
DAVID, THEY HEAD TO THE CAPITOL.

214
01:20:35,863 --> 01:20:36,864
>> Reporter: MANY MOMENTS OF 

215
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,233
SILENCE, CECILIA.

216
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:39,634
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE SCENE HERE.

217
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:40,769
I'D SAY AT LEAST 2,000 STUDENTS 

218
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:41,903
ARE HERE.

219
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:43,171
MANY OF THEM HAVE SAT DOWN IN 

220
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:44,239
THEIR SILENCE.

221
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,874
IF YOU LOOK IN THE BACK, YOU CAN

222
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:46,841
ACTUALLY SEE SOME MOVEMENT.

223
01:20:46,841 --> 01:20:48,343
THESE ARE MORE STUDENTS THAT ARE

224
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:49,010
ARRIVING HERE.

225
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:54,248
THEY WERE CHANTING AND TURNED 

226
01:20:54,248 --> 01:20:55,283
AROUND AND SAT DOWN WITH THEIR 

227
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:56,117
BACKS TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

228
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:57,953
THERE'S THE WHITE HOUSE TO THIS 

229
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:00,322
SIDE, AND THESE STUDENTS, 

230
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,290
HONESTLY, ARE NOW SEVEN, EIGHT 

231
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:03,891
MINUTES INTO THIS 17 MINUTES OF 

232
01:21:03,891 --> 01:21:06,828
SILENCE THAT THEY PLANNED TO 

233
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:08,897
HAVE HERE.

234
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,698
THEY WERE QUITE BOISTEROUS AND 

235
01:21:10,698 --> 01:21:13,134
LOUD AHEAD OF TIME WITH CHANTS 

236
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:16,337
THAT THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH, IT'S 

237
01:21:16,337 --> 01:21:18,006
TIME FOR CHANGE AGAINST THE NRA.

238
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:19,440
I'VE ASKED A COUPLE OF STUDENTS 

239
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,008
HERE IF THEY WOULD MIND FOR OUR 

240
01:21:21,008 --> 01:21:23,445
NATIONAL AUDIENCE, IF THEY WOULD

241
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:24,412
JUST BREAK THIS MOMENT OF 

242
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:25,713
SILENCE FOR JUST A SECOND TO 

243
01:21:25,713 --> 01:21:26,982

I APPRECIATE YOU BREAKING THIS 

248
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:36,924
MOMENT OF SILENCE THAT YOUR 

249
01:21:36,924 --> 01:21:40,829
FELLOW STUDENTS ARE TAKING PART 

250
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:41,062
IN.

251
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:42,197
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO BE HERE?

252
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:43,531
>> WE NEED TO GET THE VOICE OUT.

253
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:45,099
A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE AREN'T ABLE

WE'RE HERE FOR EVERYONE TO HAVE 

257
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:49,937
A VOICE AND THIS IS OUR WAY OF 

258
01:21:49,937 --> 01:21:52,474
EXPRESSING IT.

259
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:55,410
WE JUST WANT TO ASK TO BE HEARD.

260
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,078
>> YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF FRIENDS 

261
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:57,345
HERE.

262
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:58,246
HAVE YOU GUYS HAD A STRONG 

263
01:21:58,246 --> 01:21:59,013
FEELING ABOUT GUNS BEFORE?

264
01:21:59,013 --> 01:22:00,315
WAS IT PARKLAND?

265
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:01,082
TELL ME WHY YOU CAME. 

266
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:03,351
>> IT REALLY STARTED WITH SANDY 

267
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:03,584
HOOK.

268
01:22:03,584 --> 01:22:05,053
WE JUST FELT THAT WE DON'T FEEL 

269
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:06,354
SAFE IN SCHOOL ANYMORE AND THIS 

270
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:07,389
IS A PROBLEM.

271
01:22:07,389 --> 01:22:08,489
SCHOOL IS A PLACE WHERE WE 

272
01:22:08,489 --> 01:22:09,724
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO AND FEEL 

273
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:12,393
SAFE AND LEARN AND NOT HAVE TO 

274
01:22:12,393 --> 01:22:13,395
FEAR THAT SOMETHING MIGHT 

275
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:13,762
HAPPEN.

276
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:14,629
WE SHOULDN'T BE SCARED WHEN 

277
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:16,464
THERE'S A FIRE DRILL THAT 

278
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:17,031
SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN. 

279
01:22:17,031 --> 01:22:17,998
>> THE PRESIDENT IS NOT HERE IN 

280
01:22:17,998 --> 01:22:19,200
THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY.

281
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,068
DO YOU THINK YOUR MESSAGE WILL 

282
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:20,835
STILL BE HEARD?

283
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:22,637
>> YEAH, I THINK OUR VOICES WILL

284
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:24,338
BE HEARD AND THEY NEED TO BE 

285
01:22:24,338 --> 01:22:24,605
HEARD. 

286
01:22:24,605 --> 01:22:26,774

MARYLAND AND THE VIRGINIA AREAS 

291
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,016
AS YOU MENTIONED, AND AFTERWARDS

292
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:37,084
THEY PLAN TO STAY HERE FOR A 

293
01:22:37,084 --> 01:22:37,619
LITTLE BIT.

294
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:38,686
I HAD ANOTHER STUDENT TO TALK TO

295
01:22:38,686 --> 01:22:42,289
BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO 

296
01:22:42,289 --> 01:22:44,358
AHEAD AND SEND IT -- LET ME GET 

297
01:22:44,358 --> 01:22:45,893

WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO COME 

299
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:47,996
TODAY?

300
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:49,864
>> TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE 

301
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:50,565
STRICTER GUN LAWS. 

302
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:52,600
>> DO YOU THINK YOUR VOICE WILL 

303
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,534
BE HEARD EVEN THOUGH THE 

304
01:22:53,534 --> 01:22:55,002
PRESIDENT ISN'T HERE TODAY. 

305
01:22:55,002 --> 01:22:56,738
>> I'M PRETTY SURE IT WOULD.

306
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:58,973
THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE -- EVEN

307
01:22:58,973 --> 01:23:00,374
IF I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE IT, 

308
01:23:00,374 --> 01:23:00,841
OTHERS WILL. 

309
01:23:00,841 --> 01:23:01,843
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.

310
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:02,610

THIS PROTEST GOING TO 10:17 AND 

312
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,082
THEN WE WILL HEAR THE CHANTS 

313
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:07,315
AGAIN. 

314
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:08,016
>> DAVID, THANK YOU.

315
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:10,451
WE SHOULD NEVER AS A NATION GET 

316
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:11,619
COMFORTABLE HEARING CHILDREN SAY

317
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:12,787
THEY DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN SCHOOL.

318
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:13,754
>> HARD TO BELIEVE.

319
01:23:13,754 --> 01:23:16,124

HER NAME IS LISA MEDFORD.

342
01:23:47,688 --> 01:23:49,357
SHE'S GOT TO LEAVE US IN A FEW 

343
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,825
SECONDS BECAUSE SHE HAS A FEW 

344
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:52,827

WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE A STAFF AND

01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:09,477
DEKALB SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT

356
01:24:10,144 --> 01:24:11,245

BEING A STUDENT MOVEMENT AND WE 

362
01:24:17,418 --> 01:24:19,687
WERE TALKING EARLIER, MUCH LIKE 

363
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:22,256
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT OF THE

01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:32,667
OUR ENTIRE LIVES WE HAVE 

373
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:34,335
WITNESSED SCHOOL SHOOTING AFTER 

374
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:35,436
SCHOOL SHOOTING AND WE ARE 

375
01:24:35,436 --> 01:24:38,072
MAKING PARKLAND THAT LAST ONE.

376
01:24:38,072 --> 01:24:39,007
WE ARE STEPPING UP.

377
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:40,541
WE ARE MAKING OUR VOICES HEARD 

378
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:42,076
EVEN WHEN THOSE NOT EVEN OLD 

379
01:24:42,076 --> 01:24:43,478
ENOUGH TO VOTE.

380
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:44,579
WE ARE OUT HERE.

381
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,514
WE ARE TELLING LOCAL AND 

382
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:48,316
NATIONAL POLITICIANS THAT THIS 

383
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:49,217
NEEDS TO END.

384
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:52,320
YOU NEED TO PASS LEGISLATION AND

385
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,020
COMMON SENSE GUN CONTROL THAT 

386
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:56,057
WILL ENABLE OUR SAFETY TO BE A 

387
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:56,658
PRIORITY WITHIN THIS NATION. 

388
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:58,059
>> YOU GUYS ARE REGISTERING 

389
01:24:58,059 --> 01:24:59,527
SENIORS TO VOTE TODAY, TOO?

390
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:00,161
>> YES.

391
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:05,800
AFTER THIS EVENT IN OUR LIBRARY 

392
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,401
WE ARE HAVING ALL SERNIORS AND 

393
01:25:07,401 --> 01:25:09,437

395
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:10,672
>> THANK YOU FOR BEING US.

396
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:11,973
WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE 

397
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:14,976
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON TALKING

398
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:15,276
TO STUDENTS.

399
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:15,610
BACK TO YOU. 

400
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,277
>> STEVE, BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU, 

401
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:17,078
YOU MENTIONED THAT SOME 

402
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:18,246
DISTRICTS ARE NOT ALLOWING THE 

403
01:25:18,246 --> 01:25:19,680
STUDENTS TO PROTEST BUT STUDENTS

404
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,283
ARE DEFYING THAT AS WELL?

405
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:24,085
>> Reporter: WE WERE TOLD THAT 

406
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:26,788
THERE WERE SOME SCHOOLS WHERE 

407
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,489
THE STUDENTS WERE INTENDING TO 

408
01:25:28,489 --> 01:25:31,058
WALK OUT ANYWAY, SO THAT IS 

409
01:25:31,058 --> 01:25:32,227
HAPPENING NOW.

410
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:33,694
WE EXPECT TO SEE SOME OF THIS 

411
01:25:33,694 --> 01:25:35,662
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN SCHOOL 

412
01:25:35,662 --> 01:25:36,664
DISTRICTS THAT AREN'T ALLOWING 

413
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:39,901
STUDENTS TO DEMONSTRATE, THOSE 

414
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:40,835
STUDENTS ACTUALLY DO SO ANYWAY. 

415
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:43,571
>> STEVE OSUNSAMI, THANKS VERY 

416
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:43,771
MUCH. 

417
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:44,405
>> THESE STUDENTS ARE SO 

418
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:46,474
PASSIONATE AND COMMITTED TO 

419
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:48,409
CHANGE AND THESE WALK-OFFS ARE 

420
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:49,410
GOING TO HAPPEN ON THE WEST 

421
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:50,678
COAST LATER I'M SURE BUT THEY'RE

422
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:51,412
HAPPENING ON THE EAST COAST 

423
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:51,879
RIGHT NOW.

424
01:25:51,879 --> 01:25:53,581
HERE IN NEW YORK MORE THAN 1500 

425
01:25:53,581 --> 01:26:00,622
STUDENTS ARE WALKING OUT OF JOHN

426
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:06,127
F. KENNEDY HIGH AND ABC'S 

427
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:06,728
LINLINZIE

428
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:08,195
JANIS IS THERE. 

429
01:26:08,195 --> 01:26:09,163
>> Reporter: YOU CAN SEE 

430
01:26:09,163 --> 01:26:11,532
HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS GATHERING 

431
01:26:11,532 --> 01:26:12,700
BEHIND ME.

432
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,902
ONE STUDENT CAME OUT AND STARTED

433
01:26:14,902 --> 01:26:15,870
WITH, IF OUR LEADERS AREN'T 

434
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,504
GOING TO PROTECT US AGAINST 

435
01:26:17,504 --> 01:26:18,840
VIOLENCE, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

436
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,774
STAND UP FOR OURSELVES.

437
01:26:19,774 --> 01:26:20,474
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A MOMENT 

438
01:26:20,474 --> 01:26:21,342
OF SILENCE.

439
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:22,276
THEY'VE ALSO BEEN READING 

440
01:26:22,276 --> 01:26:23,811
THROUGH EACH OF THE NAMES OF THE

441
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:25,280
17 AND TELLING YOU A LITTLE BIT 

442
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,180
ABOUT EACH OF THE VICTIMS.

443
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:32,520
THEY ALSO READ A POEM FROM ALEX 

444
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:32,853
S

445
01:26:32,853 --> 01:26:35,222
SHACKTER, ONE OF THE VICTIMS 

446
01:26:35,222 --> 01:26:36,824
FROM STONEMAN DOUGLAS.

447
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:38,259
IT'S CALLED "LIFE IS LIKE A 

448
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:40,662
ROLLER COASTER."

449
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:42,597
HIS WORDS WISE BEYOND HIS YEARS.

450
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:43,831
THIS IS A MEMORIAL SERVICE.

451
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:44,665
THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE AGREED 

452
01:26:44,665 --> 01:26:46,401
WITH THEIR SCHOOL BUT WE'RE TOLD

453
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:47,735
BY A LOT OF THE STUDENTS HERE 

454
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:49,671
THIS IS ALSO ABOUT PROTEST FOR 

455
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:49,871
THEM.

456
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:50,772
MICHAEL.

457
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:52,106

01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:54,008

YOU WENT TO PARKLAND RIGHT AFTER

01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:57,645
THE SHOOTING, SPENT A LOT OF 

462
01:26:57,645 --> 01:26:58,780
TIME WITH THOSE STUDENTS.

463
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:00,214
WE COULD HEAR AT THE BEGINNING 

464
01:27:00,214 --> 01:27:01,282
OF THIS BROADCAST WHAT A 

465
01:27:01,282 --> 01:27:02,183
DIFFERENCE THEY HOPED TO MAKE, 

466
01:27:02,183 --> 01:27:03,651
THE KIND OF CONNECTIONS THEY 

467
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:06,521
HOPED TO FORGE WITH STUDENTS ALL

468
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:06,954
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 

469
01:27:06,954 --> 01:27:08,089
>> Reporter: THEY CERTAINLY DO, 

470
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:08,322
GEORGE.

471
01:27:08,322 --> 01:27:09,957
WHAT STRUCK ME BEING IN PARKLAND

01:27:09,957 --> 01:27:11,692
SO SOON AFTER THE SHOOTING IS 

473
01:27:11,692 --> 01:27:14,762
HOW QUICKLY THESE YOUNG STUDENTS

474
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:16,497
ORGANIZED, HOW QUICKLY THEY 

475
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:18,266
LEARNED ABOUT GUN LAWS.

476
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:22,103
THEY WERE SO ELOQUENT AND SO 

477
01:27:22,103 --> 01:27:24,472
COMPOSED AND MATURE BEYOND THEIR

478
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:24,839
YEARS.

479
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:27,075
ONE YOUNG WOMAN, LAUREN HUCK, 14

THIS EPIDEMIC OF SCHOOL
