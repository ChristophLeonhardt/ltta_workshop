well back in 1991 Nike was under pressure from activists to change the terrible conditions in its factories in Indonesia it was forced to make changes or lose customers and investors and consumers are increasingly searching for ways to find out just how ethical brands really are ethical watchdogs say that companies from big tech to Big Oil need to drastically improve transparency on their environmental and social impact as awareness about these issues grows so too is interested something called ethical investing what ethical investigates no longer just about avoiding the so-called sin stocks gambling alcohol and guns monitoring the social environmental and governments of companies is a growing trend but Kinsey is estimated that a quarter of the 88 trillion dollars of assets under management globally is now invested in these kinds of assets Norway has the biggest sovereign wealth fund in the world and it's signed up but does doing good in your investment portfolio improve your bank balance we don't know yet as there isn't enough information and all investments have risks but increasingly activist investors are putting pressure on companies to adopt ESG practices in order to improve long-term performance and company culture at a future generation of investors is paying attention Triodos Bank says that nearly half of 18 to 34 year olds in the UK planned to invest in a socially responsible investment fund joining us now from London Patrick Connelly Patrick is a chartered financial planner with Chase Tevere an independent financial advice company good to have you with us sir Patrick first of all what exactly do we mean by ethical or responsible investment that's that's a really good question an ethical investing is on a journey the first ethical fund was launched by Friends Provident in 1984 at the time it was probably unfairly dubbed the Brazil fund because the argument was that you'd have to be nuts to want to invest into it traditional ethical investing is about excluding sectors which which are deemed to do harm so set such as weapons manufacturing alcohol gambling tobacco the idea being that if you invested in those you are missing out on some high-growth areas and if you're missing out high-growth areas then it's probably not a very good investment proposition now what's happened in recent times is the concept of ethical investing has changed and is largely being replaced by something called ESG now ESG stands for environmental social and governance and what companies do is look to invest in firms that make a positive contribution to the environment to society and have strong governance measures things like diversification and equality so we're on a journey now from excluding sectors we don't like to investing in companies that we do like and who are adopting the right approaches which is seem to be a more positive a positive approach now back in the 1980s of course greed was good is that still the case here in in 2018 or have investors developed a conscience can they can they actually make money out of ESG investments and that is a key question because traditionally ethical investments were deemed to be a compromise between your principles on one side and the profits you want to make on the other that again has changed and the argument with the SG is that if you're investing in companies that are adopting the right practices then in the longer term they will be the more successful companies the proof of the pudding is that yeah see we don't yet know how that plays itself out but people can now invest in these companies in it and in these funds without the starting point that actually they're probably going to lose out by doing so so so Vivi and the answer is yes hope hopefully there is more scope one to invest with your principles but also two to invest in a profitable way and do we know who is investing in these ESG funds and companies is it just Millennials or or are in in older investors getting on board too Millennials seem to be the main area where there was interest in this sector it does seem that the youth of the day perhaps are more conscious about a lot of issues that the than people who were older unfortunately it's older people that tend to have more money so is older people who have more influence in terms of inflows we do see certain sectors of society in terms of older people who are investing more for example the company I work for run a service for the medical profession and we get lots of doctors who are interested in investing CLE now that may well be because of the old true istic nature of what they do the harm that they see that gambling or tobacco or alcohol dozens and so a lot of doctors for example do invest ethically that's not really as yet transmitting itself through older investors and so while there is more interest in ethical investing the Millennials as they build wealth going forwards you would hope and expect to see that actually translated into more money being invested what about corporate culture itself it is is that changing due to the fact that people are now essentially talking with their money and holding companies to account they want to be able to trust the companies that they're investing in yeah it's not changing yet or at least not to any great degree it's gradually changing what we are seeing is investment companies being more activist they're going out there and demanding the companies act in the right way we see that a lot in the news with things like um executive pay and and bonuses and the like where shareholders now are standing up and objecting to that that is a trend that should continue it's a trend it looks very likely to continue for two reasons one as you alluded to as more money goes into these funds as Millennials gain more wealth then shareholders and group shareholders will have more influence also number two is with traditional ethical investments people have accent had to make an active decision to invest in them they've had to decide I want to invest ethically whereas would the SG firms are now starting to adopt ESG in their general investment process and so investors can be investing in the SG perhaps without realizing it but what that means is there's more money behind that approach and more influence that these companies will have when they're dealing with with the companies they're investing into so how important is it Patrick for investors to understand that the different nuances of the that they're investing in do we really know what we're buying with with ESG assets we really don't with regard to ethical investments it was pretty clear you knew you were avoiding weapons manufacturers and alcohol in tobacco in gambling and all these things ESG is far more subjective different companies are adopting entirely different approaches to error and also in terms of the strictness as well so it's all well and good for investment firms to say yes we take account of ESG in our investment process but do they take account of it and use it or do they take account of it and ignore it and the only way that you can be sure that isn't is either one by doing your research or two by using an investment professional who'll do that research for you but at the moment is gray at the moment is subjective at the moment is quite new and and so we need to see more developments in that area fascinating Patrick many thanks indeed for being with us on counting the cost no problem at all
