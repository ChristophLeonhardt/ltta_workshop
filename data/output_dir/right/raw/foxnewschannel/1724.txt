UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE TO

46
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,712
THE UNITED STATES THAT WE

00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:37,480
CONDUCT THESE JOINT EXERCISES,

48
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,082

AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME

60
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,937
POSITIVE SIGNS THAT WE HAVE SEEN

61

00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:18,454
INSTANCE ON DENUCLEARIZATION,

70
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:20,657

AT THE SUMMIT, THEY ONLY OFFER

75
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:30,366
PHASED DISARMAMENT TO THE

76
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:32,902

79
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:39,008
