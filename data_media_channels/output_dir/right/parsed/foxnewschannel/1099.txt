PROTECTIONS ON OPEN VENUES
LIKE CONCERTS AND SPORTING
EVENTS.
THEY ARE KEEPING AN EYE NOW
ON THE SKY.
BRIAN?
INTERESTING WEEK OF PRIMARY
RESULTS MAINLY IN
CALIFORNIA.
14 DISTRICTS WITH HOUSE
SEATS.
THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD FLIP
THEM.
SOME MIGHT.
SEVEN OF THOSE WERE CARRIED
BY HILLARY IN 2016.
DESPITE DEMOCRATS TARGETING
THESE SEATS.
SO FAR THEY FAILED TO
ACHIEVE THE SO-CALLED BLUE
WAVE OR BIG BLUE SHUTOUT
BECAUSE OF THE SO-CALLED
JUNGLE PRIMARY AND ALL SEVEN
OF THE PRIMARIES A
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE HAS
COME OUT AHEAD AND HAS A
CHANCE TO WIN IN NOE.
WHAT CAN WE LEARN MOVING
FORWARD ABOUT THE ISSUES AND
THE RESULTS?
HERE TO DISCUSS IT IS FINE
POLSTER PANEL WE HAVE LEE
CARTER PLAYING OUTSIDE
RIGHT.
PLAYING IN THE SHAMANSKY AND
PARTNERS.
IN THE MIDDLE.
DAVID BILL O'REILLY HERE
CHIEF ELECTION ANALYST FOR
THE "WEEKLY STANDARD."
GIVE ME THE TWO MOST POPULAR
CANDIDATES REGARDLESS OF THE
PARTY.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS?
>> THE RESULTS WERE NOT I
THINK WHAT THE DEMOCRATS
HOPES THEM TO BE.
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS HELD
STRONG WHERE THEY NEEDED TO
AND THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T DO
AS WELL AS THEY HAD HOPED TO
DO THAT'S IN LARGE PART
BECAUSE THERE WAS A BIG
DIVIDE BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATS
I DON'T THINK WE SAW THE
ALIGNMENT THEY WERE HOPING
TO HAVE.
ULTIMATELY I THINK IN
CALIFORNIA THEY ARE NOT
QUITE AS LEFT AS PEOPLE HAD
THOUGHT.
THERE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE
REALLY APPEALING ON THE
REPUBLICAN SIDE AND THOSE
ISSUES COME DOWN TO HOW THEY
LOOK AT TRADE, SANCTUARY
CITIES AND IMMIGRATION.
REALLY HOPING IN CALIFORNIA
FOR BIPARTISAN IMMIGRATION
LEGISLATION.
THREE OUT OF FOUR FOLKS ARE
SAYING THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT
TO SEE.
>> THINK WANT TO SEE SOME
TYPE OF DEAL MADE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> BOTH PARTIES ARE AFRAID
TO DO A DEAL, AREN'T THEY,
ADAM?
>> FIRST OF ALL, TO GO BACK
TO THE JUNGLE PRIMARY FOR A
SECOND.
I THINK THE JUNGLE PRIMARIES
ARE A TERRIBLE IDEA.
CYNICAL ATTEMPT TO KIND OF
RIG THE SYSTEM ALMOST, YOU
KNOW, YOU TAKE A VERY
DEMOCRATIC STATE LIKE
CALIFORNIA, SURE.
THEY WOULD LOVE A JUNGLE
PRIMARY.
THEY WOULD LOVE TWO
DEMOCRATS TO RUN AGAINST
EACH OTHER IN A GENERAL.
CUTTING OUT CHOICE, OKAY.
AND IT'S JUST BETWEEN TWO
DEMOCRATS NOW AND THERE IS
NO REAL REPUBLICAN
REPRESENTATION.
BRIAN: JUST MOVING ON
THOUGH?
>> MOVING ON THOUGH, I HAVE
GOT TO TELL YOU THOUGH, I
THINK REPUBLICANS ARE
ENERGIZED.
THE PROBLEM IS JUST ONE OF
NUMBERS.
IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA,
YOU KNOW, REPUBLICANS ARE
JUST LIMITED.
HAVE YOU GOT TO ATTRACT ALL
THESE INDEPENDENT VOTERS WHO
ARE NOW REGISTERING.
BRIAN: LOOK AT ROHRABACHER'S
SEAT AND ED ROYCE'S SEAT.
THEY SHOULD BE RED.
EVEN THOUGH THE STATE IS
BLUE.
RIGHT?
>> RIGHT A LOT OF THESE
SEATS ARE MID TRANSITION.
DEFERRING RACIALLY AND
ETHNICALLY AND AT THE SAME
TIME THE DEMOCRATS BECOMING
MORE URBANIZED PARTY.
HAVE YOU THOSE TREND LINES
POINTING IN THE DEMOCRATS'
DIRECTION.
OPPOSITE TREND LINES
ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.
OVERALL MY TAKE ON TUESDAY'S
RESULTS IS THAT IT DIDN'T
TELL US ANYTHING WE DIDN'T
KNOW BY LOOKING AT THE
GENERIC BALLOT POLLS.
PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL AND
SOME OF THESE OTHER NATIONAL
INDICATORS.
BRIAN: LEE, TELL ME WHAT
DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE SAYING
IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO
HELP THEM LOCK THE SEAT AND
WHAT THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD
BE SAYING TO HELP THEM LOCK
THE SEAT.
>> DEMOCRATS HAVE TO RUN TO
THE MIDDLE NOT RESIST AT ALL
COST.
GAVIN NEWSOM RESIST WITH
RESULTS, NOT ONE THAT IS
GOING TO APPEAL.
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE
COMPROMISE AND ISSUES HAPPEN
THAT ARE MORE IN THE MIDDLE.
CONOR LAMB WAS A GOOD
BLUEPRINT FOR WHAT A
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE SHOULD
LOOK LIKE IF THEY ARE GOING
TO WIN IN THEIR DISTRICT.
BRIAN: DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING
STOP SAYING IMPEACH, RIGHT?
PRESIDENT IS SAYING BRING IT
UP.
>> WE SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
APPROVAL RATING CLIMBING,
CLIMBING, CLIMBING.
THE ECONOMY GROWING.
AT SOME POINT THIS
IMPEACHMENT IS FALLING ON
DEAF EARS.
ONLY APPEALING TO THE MOST
PARTISAN PROGRESSIVE LIBERAL
RESISTER.
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
BRIAN: DAVID, TIMELY, WHAT'S
YOUR TAKE AWAY?
>> FROM THE JUNE 5TH RHYME
MARRIES?
AGAIN, IT'S MOSTLY WHAT WE
HAVE SEEN BEFORE.
THE PARTY ESTABLISHMENT ON
BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN GETTING
THE CANDIDATES WHAT THEY
WANTED.
YOU HAVE A DEMOCRATIC
ADVANTAGE IN THE GENERIC
BALLOT.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HOUSE
VOTES, IT SORT OF SHAKES OUT
IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE
WITH THAT.
A LOT HAS CHANGED OVER THE
LAST SIX MONTHS I WOULD SAY.
NOT A LOT HAS NECESSARILY
CHANGED BETWEEN TUESDAY AND
TODAY AND HOW I WOULD SAY
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE
MID TERMS.
BRIAN: YEAH.
CIRCUMSTANCES WILL DICTATE
WHO WINS THE NEXT SIX
MONTHS.
IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S STILL
0-0.
>> IT'S A JUMP BALL.
THE GENERIC IS TIGHTENING
UP.
THE PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL
RATING IS GOING UP.
IT'S A JUMP BALL.
>> A LITTLE DEMOCRATIC
TILTED.
BRIAN: BECAUSE OF
ENTHUSIASM.
>> AND SOME OF THESE HIGH
TURNOUT CONTESTS HAVE YOU
SEEN REALLY BIG DEMOCRATIC
OVERPERFORMANCES AND THE
GENERIC BALLOT IT'S D PLUS
