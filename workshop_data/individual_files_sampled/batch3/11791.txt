hello and welcome to Sophie and Co I'm Sophie Shevardnadze the hidden language of trumps presidential campaign is affecting American Muslims who find themselves increasingly on the receiving end of rising hate crime year into Trump's Presidency how will the president's words and decisions affect the country's Islamic minority well my guest today is treat a Parsi former informal advisor to Obama administration and the head of the National Iranian American Council Muslims in America find themselves in the crosshairs once again with President Trump blamed to the tastes of his right-wing base hate crime against those who look Middle Eastern is once again on the rise as verbal attacks become physical will America's fear of terrorism have tragic consequences for the country's Islamic minority how can American Muslims fend off the attacks against them and what can be done to change the climate of hatred tweet a Parsi welcome to the show it's great to have you on our program so it's been a year since Donald Trump was elected during his campaign he made quite a lot of anti Islam comments but so far none of this have really been acted on was it all just a ploy to fire up his base or does he really hold some kind of grudge against Muslims I think it's incorrect to say that it's not been acted upon because it only took him about roughly 10 days to put into place the first Muslim ban which ended up of course being deemed unconstitutional in the court it went all the way up to the Supreme Court but then Donald Trump himself pulled it and presented a new version of that ban which is also now being blocked and will probably end up going to the Supreme Court so I think it's he clearly has acted on it I think that he does so largely because he has a base that has been fed some of this Islamophobia and wants to see it acted upon but we haven't seen him necessarily do anything concrete in the region yet short of of course de certifying the Iran deal making the future of the Iran deal very uncertain as well as what is now happening with the alliance with Saudi Arabia in which Trump so far has backed everything Saudi Arabia is doing yeah we're gonna talk in detail about the Rondon a bit later but before that the Council on american-islamic relations has noted an almost 100 percent increase in anti-muslim hate crimes in the first half of 2017 compared to 2016 why is this happening well I think it's quite clear that this is not something that is coming from the bottom up but it's actually being promoted from the top even during the Bush era after 9/11 there was an increase in anti-muslim hate crime but it didn't actually really start to rise up until during the Obama years when you had a Republican Party that was very much using a language of Islamophobia now you have a president who got elected on a platform of Islamophobia so it is quite predictable that when you have leaders using language of that kind and essentially giving a green light for these types of bigoted sentiments that that is going to lead to these types of crimes in society but obviously a lot of people has accused Trump of spurring anti-muslim sentiment across the country but research from the Pew Research Center shows that a growing number of Americans are actually becoming more sympathetic towards Muslims as Muslim discrimination a part of the US mainstream media's hysteria or is Tom Santa Aslam rhetoric simply I don't know maybe having a reverse effect I think it is having a reverse effect because a lot of people are starting to see that discrimination against Muslims in the United States or people from Middle Eastern background a lot of the people that are being discriminated against are actually not Muslims but they're being perceived to be Middle Easterners and Muslims there's a lot of people who started to realize that that's no different from the discrimination that earlier and continuously is taking a place against the african-american community or other communities and as a result it should be opposed in that same way but while the number of people who are opposed to Islamophobia have increased it doesn't mean that Islamophobic attacks and crimes will not increase that small minority that hold those views feel emboldened and empowered by the rhetoric and by the policy initiatives of the Trump administration I think that's the reason why we're seeing an increasing number of such crimes so we are now witnessing a rise of the extreme right in America why it's supremacist groups fueled by our racial tensions do you think this standoff is going to be strictly left versus right on Tifa versus neo-nazi or are Muslims in danger as well well I think we first have to recognize that while there is a minority that is perpetrating some of these crimes and while there is a political element essentially the white house itself that is to certain extent allowing this to happen and even promoting it through their policy initiatives the United States as a whole as your own statistics showed is actually starting to unite against these types of crimes we saw how people were protesting at the airport's when this was happening we saw how the courts have shot down president Trump's efforts to institutionalize discrimination against Muslims and Middle Easterners through the travel and the Muslim bound forces so I think the elements inside of the American society that that actually can battle this and I can bring about a much more tolerant society definitely are there I think actually they are having momentum on their side but the reason why we're seeing this is because they don't have the presidency on their side right now and then there's the other side of Islamophobia the fact that it is brought up anytime someone says anything critical about Islam do you feel that the non-muslim majority's concerns and fears aren't being addressed properly since people who raised our voices are branded bigots instantly I'm not sure if that's the case I don't know if I agree with your premise but I do believe that you have a scenario in which if you want to raise question marks etc there's a way to do it and there's a way to do it if you are essentially putting all 1 billion people in the same category or you're essentially treating Isis as if it's a representative of 1 billion Muslims since clearly people are going to be raising concerns about bigotry and quite correctly so if there's an academic conversation about a theological conversation where Islam that would be a completely different thing that's not what we're seeing what we're seeing is that if there is an attack by someone who's been radicalized in the United States which was the case with a terrorist act in Manhattan a two or so weeks ago that immediately the political establishment under Trump pushes for new immigration measures that are completely unfounded but when you have a gentleman go in and Massacre people in churches we cannot have any conversation about gun control I think you've seen that this is a political problem this is not an issue in which people are shutting down debate or that we cannot have a conversation about Islam those conversations that can be had but not if they are put in the language of bigotry then that's completely self-defeating for those people raising it like you're saying there isn't terror attack in New York was conducted by an Uzbek radicalized in the United States it's her knives Boston bombers as well as the son Bernard aber attackers were US citizens so was the latest terror attacks haven't been done by homegrown terrorists tell me why are American Muslims radicalizing well your question right there is false you say why are American Muslims radicalizing you're speaking as if every American Muslim is radicalized that's not the case you have examples of people being radicalized in the Muslim community you have examples of people being radicalized in non-muslim communities and we saw an entire March of neo-nazis in Charlottesville those were not Muslims who had been radicalized in the United States so when you mentioned that you know we can't talk about Islam without being finger pointed up being bigots well if you phrase the question that way that you just did and that is not a fair way of asking that question that is frankly a bigoted way of asking that question okay exactly the moderate Muslims American Muslims are trying hard to spread the message that Islam is a religion of peace however the actions of radicals the radical people are hundred times stronger in persuading the public otherwise can you blame Americans were feeling scared of Muslims first of all I'm myself not a Muslim and I think this question is actually not about Islam per se we're not having a theological conversation in the United States about this I think if media is presenting perpetrators of terrorist attacks as representatives of an entire community or an entire religion then eventually you're going to have politicians who will try to benefit and further advance these bigoted notions and use it as a political platform for themselves that can get them to the presidency that's exactly what has happened if we don't want to see these things happening it should also start with the media having a much more neutral and much more academic and correct view looking at these things because you cannot on the one hand promote the notion that any act that is taking place is a representative an entire community and then be surprised that people might become scared of that community that there's a very logical link in between those two the question is are there networks out there there are deliberately promoting these types of views and then there's always also the use of war terrorism Saturday's use them cautiously I believe towards Muslims because the racially motivated shootings done by neo-nazis in America aren't classified as terrorism by the authorities white supremacist rams a car into a crowd and then the president blames both sides but a similar attack done by a Muslim is immediately branded terrorism which it undoubtedly is of course but why the discrepancy it's a great question why is it that if so even in some cases in which there has been America Muslims who have been radicalized in the United States or in some cases may not actually have been radicalized but may be suffering from completely different other issues and then just use Isis as a way of justifying their horrible acts that they're doing even then we're very quick to call that terrorism whereas when we have examples in which someone even walks into a church and expresses political motives which is what happened in the south of the United States not this recent attack in Texas but the previous one in which he said that he wanted to have a racial war he expressed clear political motives it was still not categorized as an act of terror in fact as the police arrested him they made sure that they can stop by at Burger King and make and feed him before they continued on to the prison these are clear discrepancies and these are some of the things that are causing a lot of people a lot of concern about whether the law is being treated equally we'll take a short break right now and when we're back we'll talk about the future of the Iran nuclear deal with tweeter Parsi who was the Obama administration's informal Iran adviser during those historic talks stay with us and we're back with treati Parsi had of the National Iranian American Council who was also an informal advisor to the Obama administration during nuclear talks with Iran discussing president Trump's Middle Eastern policies but first I still want to ask you a few questions about the Manhattan attacks Manhattan attacker said he was radicalized in response to US bombings in Iraq last year the ER londa club shooter said his attack was in response to US bombings in Afghanistan I mean the logic of terrorists is of course hard to explain but is it maybe not too daring to think that there would be fewer terrorist attacks in the u.s. if yours didn't bomb all those places in the Middle East certainly their views inside of the US government itself you even saw some leaked memos which former bush officials made it quite clear that they believe that their campaign is producing more terrorists than actually eliminating terrorists so there's definitely an element there that is difficult to get around which is that all of these foreign interventions nevertheless tend to radicalize people and as a result bring some of that terror all the way back to the United States but there are other elements as well such as the US has support for Saudi Arabia and essentially turning a blind eye to the tremendous amount of funding and other forms of ideological and logistical support has been provided by Saudi Arabia to terrorist networks and because the Saudis are allies of the United States the u.s. essentially has continuously turned a blind eye to that talking about double standards how can Trump say whatever it is that he's saying about Islam and Muslims and then you know go on trips to Saudi Arabia and do like great business with them you're no stranger to diplomacy tell me are things like this just being mitigated by diplomatic language certainly not I think we this is a double standard this is something that a lot of people here in Washington are also quite concerned about that the United States currently under the Trump administration have essentially written the Saudis a captive launch in which they can do almost anything they want and they can count on us support what is happening right now in Lebanon is causing a lot of concern because it appears to be such that the Saudis are preparing for a military confrontation in some form of coordination with Israelis and whether they have received the green light from the United States or not they appear to believe that they have it or that they will get it and I don't see how that actually is advancing stability in the region nor do I see how that is advancing US interests in the region the US and Saudi Arabia have recently scalded Iran for helping the Houthi rebels in Yemen Antrim is really friendly with the Saudi leadership to sea view Iran through Saudi glasses I think Trump had almost no perspective on Iran be prior to running for office and at this moment it seems that his perspective is almost exclusively one that is informed by the Saudis when it comes to Iran and again it's not to make the argument that the Saudis don't have legitimate concerns they do and so do the Iranians the question is where is the u.s. perspective in all of this the United States is not and cannot be a proxy of the Saudis because they have their own interest and they're pursuing them right now so I can understand why the Saudis perhaps thought that this is a good moment to escalate tensions I don't understand why that would be a good thing from the US perspective and that's where a lot of concern is coming in which is is Donald Trump pursuing US interests here or is he essentially just being led around by the Saudis on this issue and of course the Iran nuclear deal yes big topic Trump is now looking to sabotage and it seems to work it seemed to work okay under Obama and the US didn't get a nuclear Iran Iran got the sanctions lifted why is this White House teams so hell-bent on scuttling this deal isn't it good for the u.s. I certainly think it's good for the US you have the Secretary of State the Secretary of Defense the chairman of the Chiefs choice of staff I believe even mcmaster all recognizing that it lies in the interest of the United States to continue with the nuclear deal they may have some concerns about certain aspects of it but that does not mean that a complete sabotage of the deal or a killing of it is in the interests of the US this is entirely driven by Trump himself and his motivations are not entirely clear there are a couple of contending factors they may be mutually may not be mutually exclusive such as the fact that he simply opposes anything that Obama has achieved and as a result he is adamantly against his nuclear deal for no other reason that it has Obama's name on it you have the Israeli and the Saudi factor again the Saudis and the Israelis want the United States to come back into the region as a strong military dominant military power and re-establish the balance of power that existed in the region prior to 2003 that necessitates no diplomacy with Iran no deal with Iran because any deal with Iran would actually resolve some of those tensions between the u.s. and Iran and the Saudis don't want to see that happening they want the u.s. to come back in and provide Saudi Arabia with security and balance Saudi Arabia's own rivals in the region that is part of the reason I would say the main reason as to why the Saudis have been so adamantly against a nuclear deal so what do you think will happen I mean Trump never hid his feelings about the Iran deal but he never openly vowed to scrap it he said the deal needs to be actually would Iranians go for it he actually said no one will go for a renegotiation the Russians will not go for a renegotiation the Chinese dear on ian's and the Europeans made it very clear during their visit here in Washington this week they will not go for any renegotiation and Trump said at his press conference that he wants to see Congress changed the terms of the deal if Congress doesn't do so he said he will terminate the deal himself that's the words he used he said he will terminate it so how far he the chief no dance how far will he go to kill it he can go the full distance he could in December decide not to renew the waivers the US sanctions have not actually been lifted they have been waived which means that every 90 or 120 days they need to be reweighed the next deadline for that is in December mid of December if he doesn't do and then then the United States is in clear violation of the deal and were one significant step closer towards seeing the deal being killed so what level of hostile action is it going to take for it on to consider the deal cancelled and renew its nuclear program if Trump does not renew the waivers and if it leads to a lot of companies not entering the Iranian market or potentially even leaving the Iranian market then the benefits for Iran to be compliant with the deal which they currently are will essentially have been evaporated and at that moment I fear that we may see the Iranians taking the first steps towards restarting the nuclear program which will only further ratchet up tensions and further increase the risk of war that's the big danger here this is not just about killing the nuclear deal this is automatically putting the United States on a path towards a military confrontation in the region well like you wrote when Obama was trying to make a deal with Iran he had a choice of nuclear Iran or war since Trump now wants to cancel the deal does that mean he wants war if he cancels the nuclear deal he will likely end up only facing two options war or accepting a nuclear Iran since it's clear he doesn't want to have a nuclear Iran one has to ask oneself is he doing it because he wants to drive things towards a war from a security standpoint with us involved in Iraq and Afghanistan want a war with Iran be a disaster for those two campaigns how's it going to be better for American security situation it will be a disaster for the United States it will be a disaster for most of the region it will be a disaster for the Iranians obviously the instability will spread elsewhere potentially all the way to Russia I think the only one who calculate that this could be beneficial to them as Israelis and the Saudis who believe that Iran has become too powerful they themselves are not capable of pushing back Iran or reducing Iran's influence so they want the United States to do it for them and Trump seems to be more than willing to play along with that game but besides these two countries and potentially the UAE I have a hard time seeing anyone calculating that this will be to their benefit I also happen to believe that the Israelis and the Saudis and the u ue are miscalculated I think it's gonna end up being a disaster for them as well I don't see any winners in this war tell me and show me the logic what is behind the American establishments disdain of Iran I mean American Gulf allies have no fewer human rights problems or foreign policy mishaps than Tehran letting alone like you yet have to show me like a Shia Muslim terrorist who has blown up something lately everyone who blows something up lately are from the other side yet it's Iranians who are seen as the face of evil it seems quite irrational to me why is it happening who benefits from this you mentioned something we looked at the State Department's list of terrorist organization recently and 40-plus of all of the organizations on that list are Sunni or Wahhabi organizations with one connection or another to Saudi Arabia only to have direct links to the Iranian government yet as you mentioned all of the focuses on Iran and we're doing everything we can to turn a blind eye on the very very negative activities of the Saudis why is that well you know Washington is a city that is susceptible to a lot of foreign influence and clearly there has been a lot of Saudi foreign influence in the city we you saw under Obama that there was a deliberate effort to be able to reduce America's dependence on Saudi Arabia now we're going in the opposite direction but I do believe that obviously there are historical reasons for the Iranians and the Americans to have bad relations and it goes both ways there's a lot of people inside of the Iranian government that still cannot let go over the United States as an enemy but what we're seeing now is a deliberate effort to ratchet these tensions up ratchet up these images you've hit it on the nail and tell me briefly America's distrust of Iran is mutual like you said Iranian leaders are also saying that America is Iran's number one enemy etc etc is any sort of deal between these two nations just an illusion briefly please no on the on the contrary we had a deal we had a nuclear deal it was put together by the US Iran and five other countries it was a tremendous success up until this point there's been eight reports by the IAEA who have stated clear that the Iranians are complying with the deal if that diplomacy had been built upon if it had been continued we could have also seen a reduction of tensions in other areas I don't think the United States in Iran ever would become partners or allies at least not under the current government in Iran but they could lose each other as enemies they could tactically and strategically collaborate in areas of common interest and then compete with each others in areas where they don't have common interest but it wouldn't be a characterize and a relationship characterized by enmity it would be simply a much more complex relationship that opportunity to lose each other as enemies is the opportunity that Donald Trump is destroying by going down the path of killing the Iran deal all right thank you very much for this interesting insight treati Parsi we were talking to happy national Iranian American Council and Obama's administration informal advisor during talks with Iran discussing president Trump's Middle Eastern policies and the future of the Iran deal and that's it for this latest edition of sofiane coil see you next time thank you you
