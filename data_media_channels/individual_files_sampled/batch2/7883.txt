these guys are on real political reporting tonight that's why I'm doing a live video here that the Senate Democrats have given up again oh this is way worse than last time because last time they said well it's just a three-week extension and and so we're not including docker in it that means the dreamers that we pretend to be fighting for is not going to be part of the budget but it's okay because the budget only got excited for three weeks and we got chip as part of this deal and the next time we'll get darker that was the claim now they're say yep just kidding not gonna get daca we're given up on the dreamers another massive unreal cave-in so these are the Senate Democrats apparently the House Democrats some of them want to fight well let's hope to god that's true so the House and Senate Democrats apparently for the moment being do not agree so dick Durbin patty Murray the people quoted in the article they're saying well look the budget we really need to approve it why because oh we don't want the markets shaking they don't say that part the daughter's tell us that they're there love the markets going up they don't want them to go down they don't tell you that part that's why they're doing it that's why they're doing their Craven they're unbelievably Craven so they're gonna surrender again and that is their go-to plan but that's okay because they say no we're doing two separate tracks one is the budget and that and then afterwards we're gonna do daca separately but come on is anyone really that stupid the budget is your only leverage they need your votes to pass a budget because you need 60 votes in the Senate if you give up your leverage what do you have left nothing nothing there so they went back to the well they said no no it's okay Mitch McConnell promised that not a three-week accession but if we just give him the whole budget then afterwards he'll bring up the dreamers look the last time you read that stupid deal the Republicans turn around afterwards it was just a three-week accession and they rubbed it in your face Trump and the others said oh surrender by the Democrats they lost we won you think those guys are gonna take up oh well you know what you guys we're good guys are bad yeah we'll bring up daca voluntarily No Oh what they're gonna do is they're gonna come out the next day and Spike the bongo idiot losers we win you lose we're never breaking up the dreamers and you and we just got everything we wanted and you got nothing that's what's gonna happen these are the worst losers in American history and looking at dick durbin face right now the political article gonna just pathetic man go home clean up go home what are you doing so these guys are never gonna fight for you they're donors they will fight for tooth and nail you guys never by the way I'm gonna have all the details tomorrow on the show and I'll give you the quotes I'll give you the numbers but on top of everything else they gave the Republicans more in defense spending than Trump had asked for Politico described it as a huge increase much more than Trump had asked for boy master negotiators they are the worst of the worst at least the Republicans you see coming from in front of you these Democrats come from behind you and then they give the Republicans everything what I just they sicken me
