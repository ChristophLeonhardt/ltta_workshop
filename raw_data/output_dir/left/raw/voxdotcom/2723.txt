1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,480
The census is the catalyst of American
public policy.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,340
It shapes voting districts

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,540
and it determines how your public
schools will get funded. Because this

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,550
data is used in myriad democratic and
economic functions it's critical that we

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,690
get it right.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,109
Unfortunately the 2020 edition might be

7
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,490
in trouble, which has caused concern
among experts for the integrity of the

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,460
country's most authoritative dataset.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,080
The census is centuries old, but this
story starts at the conclusion of the

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,940
2010 census. The Bureau had shot past
cost estimates on its way to the most

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,910
expensive census per capita of all time.
So in 1970 it cost $16 to count each

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,000
housing unit and in 2010 it cost around
92 dollars to count each housing unit.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is all in 2020 dollars. That's
Robert Goldenkoff.

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,059
His office redid the

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,180
2020 census on its list of government
initiatives at a high risk of failure.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,080
A key reason? The funding just isn't there.

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,939
Congress limited the budget for the 2020

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,100
census to the amount spent on the 2010
census.

19
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,640
The nation is getting more

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,170
complex and less willing to participate
in the census and because the

21
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,110
Constitution requires a complete count,
the Census Bureau has to do more work in

22
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,580
order to obtain that complete count.

23
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,560
So why might it cost more to count certain groups?

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,360
This scene from an episode of
Master Of None gives some clues.

25
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,820
It follows a cab driver back to his
apartment, where he's living with at

26
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,560
least three other adult men. So this one
apartment contains four distinct

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,940
households in New York City, a region of
notoriously hard to count tracts.

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,860
Census tracts are designated "hard to
count" for many reasons.

29
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,460
They could be

30
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:02,560
full of renters or they could have an
abundant homeless population.

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,979
Topographically complex regions are hard
to count, as are tracts with limited

32
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,560
access to broadband internet.

33
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,460
It's the people at the margins of society.

34
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,760
More impoverished don't speak the language.
Then we have procedures to try to

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,140
compensate for that. Mr. Prewitt would know
about the challenges in taking a census.

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,020
He was director during the year 2000
count. The last 2 to 3 percent of the

37
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,600
census is very expensive.

38
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,940
Further complicating matters, a new proposal to

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,860
change the census could further increase
costs and effect response rates.

40
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,360
The Department of Justice requested that the
bureau add a question about citizenship

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,620
to the short-form decennial census.

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,540
The argument in the letter is that the

43
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:53,959
Justice Department wants better data on
where citizens are in the country,

44
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,740
in order to enforce the voting rights laws.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,079
The citizenship question already appears

46
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,410
in the American Community Survey which
collects data annually.

47
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,669
It just goes to a much smaller portion
of the country. I can only do

48
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:11,299
consequences and I can say the
consequences of acting as if you need

49
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:15,049
this for the Voting Rights Act is
inconsistent with the fact that it

50
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:16,160
already exists.

51
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,320
A more complete dataset
on citizenship could give the Department

52
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:24,500
of Justice more granular data to work
with, but that would depend on an

53
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,300
adequate response rate and the national
political climate might make that more difficult.

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,700
Some people have expressed
fear that the government might use

55
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,120
census data to aid deportations or
otherwise harm the communities.

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,800
We have experienced in American history where
being counted in the census did

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,000
result in painful consequences for the
Japanese, who were interned.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,200
Americans today have a historically low level of
trust with their government. That fact

59
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,000
paints an unsettling portrait.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,359
Certainly today's environment, if you told the

61
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:59,940
authorities where
a lot of undocumented people live, the

62
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,910
authorities would I think take advantage
of that piece of information. That's

63
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,740
their job.

64
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:10,950
I think the chances of having anything like a complete census, if we

65
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,160
have the citizenship question is simply
not the case.

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,640
There are proponents who favor a
mainstream citizenship question. The

67
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,630
general argument is that census data are
used to apportion seats in Congress and

68
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,260
distribute funds, but the Constitution
requires the census to count for all

69
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,690
persons. That's because the census is a
survey of an economy that includes the

70
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,100
contributions of residents who aren't
citizens. The stakes are whether we care

71
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,000
about about a representative democracy.
The inequality's, already economic

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,440
inequalities are severe if you duplicate
economic inequalities with political

73
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,860
inequalities, then you simply have a
different kind of society and it's not

74
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,620
a democracy.

75
00:05:02,600 --> 00:00:00,000
you
