and you know where I come from in the UK feminists compete to see who can be the most ugly and there is a stiff competition for that kind of thing like the uglier you are the bigger the feminist you are that's how it works back in my neck of the woods and there's some very ugly women where I come from so I'm so thrilled to be here in Israel I feel like it's kind of my natural home and that I've actually been here before and I happen it's my ambition to be Jewish I know so a cab driver the other day or yesterday whenever the hell I got here said are you Jewish and I was like yeah yes I am and then realized I didn't speak a word of anything that might support that I was like no I'm not I got the nose but I didn't get the Jewish bit that so I'm hopeful to become Jewish all of my friends are Jewish I'm hoping that I'll just get it by osmosis if I just rub up against them enough I ask my girlfriend like what's the one thing I don't do over here two things not to piss people off because I think you know it's easy for me I don't have a filter I'll upset someone and she was like well number one don't get your tits out in Jerusalem I fight okay well I wasn't massively planning on doing that anyway number two if a guy's got a hat on or long hair don't go rubbing your groin on him I wasn't planning on doing that either but anyway in the country that I come from as you'll appreciate things are going downhill pretty fast many thanks to our Muslim Mayor Sadiq Khan do we get a boom and I am not a short-girl but he is nipple height nipple height nipple height is not a height you want to be I ran into him the other day and he was that nipple height was that I shouted at him he is a really annoying man and he has sent our country down the tube my big message to Israel is if you hear anything said by Sadiq Khan know that that is not what regular British people think he does not speak for Britain I don't speak for Britain nobody speaks for Britain the good British people speak for Britain but Sadiq Khan does not speak for Britain no sir thank you very much indeed under Sadiq Khan we have now got the highest murder rate for decades we have a higher murder rate oh I say the emergency lighting has arrived if someone having a baby Jesus Christ well just point it somewhere darling but not at me so under Sadiq Khan our murder rate is oh that would be nice for everyone a little projection of my phone sorry for that you've now got a shadow of my pubic zone how nice for you under Sadiq Khan our murder rate has gone sky-high it's higher than New York's right now as 78 people so far have been killed by stabbing this year I'm sorry sorry 79 79 one just went down and that is what's going on in my country our people are being attacked by acid being attacked by people with machetes on mopeds and being attacked by terrorists and what do our politicians say they say let's make heart-shape gestures at the sky well big news heart shaped gestures at the sky aren't going to cure anything they're not going to saw anything and they're not going to stop the problems that we've got so if you hear anything from Sadiq Khan a big message from me do not listen to a word that little man set now being pro-israel in the UK has got me into quite a lot of trouble I used to have a radio show on LBC a talk-show it was a nice show I loved it it was the fastest-growing show on commercial radio blacks on that radio show I once had a little rant about BB who is down to be husband number six but he doesn't know it yet and I said I love Benjamin Netanyahu if only we had the same policies as BB if you launch a rocket at my house I not only will blow up your house I will blow up the houses of your family and your friends too and that's what BB doesn't just build a wall above ground BB doesn't just build an iron dome no BB builds walls underground as well to stop these little bastards getting to you I love Benjamin Netanyahu so I went off on one in that manner at 10:00 a.m. on Sunday in London on the radio and guess what I got a government warning from Ofcom the regulator for being too pro-israeli so I didn't get away with that so being pro-israeli in the UK is not seen as a popular decision and it's not seen as something you're allowed to be and I think that's one of the things we suffer from we suffer from a media that's dictated that you're not allowed to be pro-israeli even though we have that hezbollah flags waved down the center of London because Sadiq Khan the Muslim mayor said that was acceptable how is that possible in the UK today when I'm not allowed to be pro-israeli on the radio I wanted to say something about jihad ease in the UK as well Oh government allowed 462 jihadi is back to the UK our government welcomed them back it gave them it said you know welcome back to the UK we will reintegrate you as serving jihadis and we gave them school places and we gave them a homes and we put them on programs to try to reintegrate them to make them feel better that's how we treat jihadis in the UK but it had me wondering you know three dummy well foot well that too it had me wondering about returning jihadists because that's a little bit of a misnomer right there isn't it returning jihadi like your job was to go and blow yourself the hell up and so what you are actually is a failure you are a failed jihadi because you didn't even managed to do your goddamn job and if you're a failure you don't have any place in my country the other thing that's failing crap about jihad ease and jihadi families they don't allow their boys to study biology or girls bits at school because it's rude so my question to jihad is its if you're going to get your 72 virgins what the bloody hell are you going to do with them if you've never learned what to do anyway people like me as seen as a bit of the enemy in the UK an enemy of the state very much like Tommy Robinson who was put in prison for third pick up I was very much hoping that the World Cup in Russia someone would get a grip of that in a stand it would have been epic wouldn't it on the England some of the England games that someone have managed to get that going if I had all the money in the world I would have paid to make that happen but yeah the poor man imprisoned for 13 months in under five hours for trying to report on the grooming gangs they call them and of course those is that clever language right there isn't it rape squads for reporting on rape squads in the UK he was imprisoned for that well they call them Asians but their favourite term actually for the last squad that we are allowed to talk about because the court case has finished before I get taking them so they called them Oxford men Oxford men all the learned men of Oxford raping those eleven year old Oxford men that's what the BBC called them I mean seriously this ability of the media to use language against us has been truly horrific but one of the great things is that we are starting to fight back we have worked out that we will not be spoon-fed this from the media anymore I apologise to my mother for swearing we will not sit down and because this stuff about Israel anymore and there are many people just like me in the UK who are huge supporters of Israel and everything you are know that people blow that Israel should have its own place its own country its own identity to defend and if you're an arab nation you've already got 22 goddamn countries so leave israel the hell alone we're very clear and one of the glorious things that happened in my little lifetime of twenty years is that trump finally got into power in the USA so we have trouble one of the most brilliant things trump has succeeded in this last couple days is to get a travel ban implemented in the United for you all what is more useless is it a comp flavored lollipop or the ninth circuit's ninth circuit I'm a little worried for the people that know what the lollipop tastes like a sort of San Francisco okay I'll let you off you know all about it sweetie people okay so anyway um I think that might go on the offensive list yes anyway the point rather being is the truck the travel ban is now in place and people try to call it a Muslim ban it's not a goddamn Muslim ban if you want to hurt the country that you are entering yes you're going to be banned if that makes you a Muslim then you've got the issues not Trump second great thing that trumps done in the last week is got the USA the hell out of the United Nations ha hallelujah for too long Israel has been the target and the victim of the UNHCR HRC for too long every single meeting item 7 on the agenda Israel how is that possibly justified or fair the United Nations Human Rights Council is essentially like putting pedophiles in charge of kiddie care it is that bad it is full of the wrong type of people Saudi Arabia sit there with a tea towel on their goddamn head throwing gays off of buildings chopping the arms and legs off of people who stole and stuff you've got the Congo there Venezuela you know they're eating their own cats and somehow they make Israel the issue Trump has led the way and got the hell out of that place and in a final move widely supported by people in the UK he has moved your embassy back to it right for that in the UK but so much support that's not reported because we're not allowed to talk about it because it's Israel you guys so much support for that embassy move and so much support for what Trump has done so please know that those are silenced voices in the UK but they really are right behind you right behind Trump and right behind Israel those voices are there you just can't hear them right now see gladder as a me did someone say you want me to speak louder teenagers from the north don't say Israeli Arabs like they would say Oh Julie thank you for that teenagers from the north if I marry anybody else my father says I'm out of the will I'm not allowed although you know we have quite a lot in common here Israel and I like I can't bloody stand my neighbors at home either it really pissed me off I don't like any of them they throw over my fence as well like we got the same problems going on and Prince William has been here I think he followed me obviously he said he wants lasting peace you know why because he's just had a new baby and his brothers just married an absolute lunatic so he's had to do a runner to Israel to get some goddamn lasting peace that's why he's here I'm glad he's here and I feel like I'm really glad that he's starting to come around to this idea that lasting peace matters and he said that the relationship between the UK and Israel has never been stronger so let's start hearing some of that in the press for a change he spoke about the technology that we share the ideation that we share the security that we share he talked about our shared understanding of the world and I think that's also a really important step for us I had the gift today of being taken up to Judea and Samaria thank you it's a very beautiful place to be and I can say it's utterly thrilling to be in a place that so truly Israeli homes Israeli Oh University and an Israeli place that's really the heart of everything you're about which is making life better for a whole bunch of people and I was blessed to be there and I thank you very much for sharing that with me naturally me being me we were in the cab on the way back to the hotel I will be finishing soon for questions I promise I know it's really hot we were in the cab on the way back to the hotel and the taxi driver said okay we're getting up to the security checkpoint nothing nothing say nothing say nothing Shalom Shalom Shalom Shalom Shalom so we're in the back of the car there's me and Oliver my brilliant brilliant cameraman here it's not mine but I try and own him thank you everyone Oliver Oliver dresses like a lunatic but he's actually relatively sane I was like yeah I had to cut the sleeves off my jacket to get it on I think no one will notice Oliver it's all fine anyway because of Oliver looking look slightly like a reprobate and because of me with my stupid hair we wind down the window of the taxi as a taxi driver came up to the security checkpoint and we went along for so long Oliver overdid the salute went a little bit sky-high and then we've got pulled over the whole Shillong didn't work at all and then she comes in the back and she goes have you got your passport now I haven't so anyway eventually we got through our taxi driver wasn't best pleased but my message is I'm probably not the person to send through a checkpoint if you want to get anywhere fast and I will wrap up I will pass out two questions please know that you can ask me anything you want at all I am truly impossible to defend the job that I see that I have now that I've decided I have is to defend our shared judeo-christian culture that matters so we are now in a fight for Western civilization this is a battle that is on and I am up for that fight every single day every single minute every single hour and I stand with you and there are positive signs there is hope out there I promise you I could bring you all the stories of doom and gloom but that's not what this evening is about across Europe now there is sign of hope in Hungary we have Viktor Orban who's doing a terrific job in Austria we have a brave guy a young guy I love him he's husband number 8 he doesn't know that yet either do you mind being quiet behind the bar or I'm going to come back there and take you out from the kneecaps that wind it in in Germany the opposition the main opposition party now is the alternative food Deutschland and they are fighting back for Germans and the right for Jews in Germany to have a safe place to call home and that safe place is being eroded fast and in Italy finally they are turning back the way they have turned back the boats this wave of Hope is spreading and I feel it and I feel it in the UK too because I feel this huge silent force of people just waiting to pour out in support when change happens I feel it's happening so I do feel that there's hope out there so as I leave this conversation I make some promises to you I promise to keep telling the truths that matter and to keep telling the truth I promise to keep standing with Israel and your right to have your state that is just your fan you love the world you have a friend in Donald Trump you have a friend in Australia where's Australia you have a friend in South Africa you have a friend from the UK you have a friend from South America hey you have a friend from near Gaza that's here what other countries do we have here but Moscow most of all and above all of that maybe not above all of that you totally got a friend in me I love you all very much thank you very much I'm here with the team from rebel media and we are bringing you the truths that the mainstream media won't tell you about Israel right here on the border of the Gaza Strip if you want to hear more about our journalism please do join us at rebel is real calm you
