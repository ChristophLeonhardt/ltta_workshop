move over Serena Williams it's time for Christine Blasi Ford to play the victim card due to an offensive editorial cartoon check out this genuinely hilarious and spot-on cartoon that is now being condemned by the usual suspects for being not just offensive but wildly offensive who the cartoon depicts Ford making a series of ridiculous demands to the Senate Judiciary Committee this includes her request for roses sparkling water and a bowl of green M&Ms the news peg of course was based on Ford's conditions a while back many of them outrageous in terms of having her testify against US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh according to that paragon of virtue known as vice the outcry to the cartoon was Swift readers and Twitter users called out the indie star for its insensitive depiction while others decried its misogyny and won't even express sympathy for the female journalists who work at the Indy star yeah apparently this cartoon is misogynistic because it makes fun of a sexual abuse victim even though none of Ford's allegations have been proven in a court of law even though Ford has no evidence no corroboration no witnesses but she does have hurt feelings predictably the Indy star served up a groveling apology for the cartoon stating that it quote did not meet our high standards end quote the Indy star also pointed out that the Ford cartoon was run next to another cartoon that quote presented an opposing view end quote oh but that's the rub isn't it folks as much as the left adores diversity they don't very much care for diversity of thought so even presenting both sides of a story is off side well so much for that First Amendment thingy alas throwing their editorial cartoonists under the bus stands in sharp contrast to how the melbourne-australia base herald-sun handled outrage in certain quarters over its supposedly offensive cartoon depicting the Serena Williams meltdown last month at the US Open naturally because the subject matter was both female and black this cartoon was decried as being not only misogynist but racist as well check out this suite of outrage from Reverend Jesse Jackson who stated quote this despicable cartoon tried and failed to diminish the greatness and grace of Serena Williams racism in any form is unacceptable end quote yeah this coming from a huckster who once referred to New York City as Hymie town but not only did the herald-sun defend the cartoon and its cartoonists they actually reprinted the illustration as part of a collage on the front page a few days later take that snowflakes clearly The Herald Sun unlike the indie star has a measure of testicular fortitude and this paper Down Under realizes that the editorial cartoon has forever existed as a medium that exaggerated sand yes pushes the envelope but in acquiescing to the SJW mob the indie star is perpetuating the philosophy of the lunatic fringe of the me2 movement namely that if a woman is making an accusation against a man he must be considered guilty until proven innocent and pity the delusional cartoonist in 2018 who dares to mock such an accuser for he or she shall be forced to walk the editorial plank at the very first signs of discontent for the rebel media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
