day 498 of the Trump administration and the president said today the June 12th North Korea nuclear summit is back on he had cancelled it just a few days back and there's more The Wall Street Journal reports tonight the White House is planning for yet another potential summit this one between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin but more on that in just a moment first today's announcement on the nuclear summit came after the president met with the top North Korean official for over an hour in the Oval Office something historic in and of itself kim yeongcheol is the North Korean leaders right-hand man former Intel chief and top nuclear weapons negotiator and as the New York Times points out he's the first North Korean official to set foot in the White House since the year 2000 only the second ever to meet with a sitting American president after the meeting President Trump spoke to reporters about denuclearization but listen carefully as he also here sets expectations mr. president what's your sense of what the North Koreans are willing to do on the issue of denuclearization I know they want to do that they want other things along the line they want to develop as a country that's going to happen I have no doubt gonna be June 12th we'll be in Singapore it'll be a beginning I don't say and I've never said it happens in one meeting you're talking about years of hostility years of problems it was a really hatred between so many different nations but I think you're gonna have a very positive result in the end president Trump also said sanctions were a topic in today's meeting adding that for now no new penalties will be imposed on the north one thing I did do and whose very important we had hundreds of new sanctions ready to go on and he did not the director did not ask but I said I'm not gonna put them on until such time as the talks break down we have very significant sanctions on that but we had hundreds we have hundreds that are ready to go but I said I'm not gonna but why would I do that when we're talking so nicely today's news of course follows a rollercoaster ride of mixed signals Peter Baker of the New York Times wrote today quote the on-again off-again summit meeting scheduling had all the earmarks of a TV cliffhanger from a president who made a name for himself hosting a reality show on NBC for 14 years only this time there were deadly serious consequences essentially mr. Trump and mr. Kim are right back to where they were shortly before the president abruptly canceled the meeting eight days ago back to conciliatory language with no clearer understanding of what an actual agreement would look like but with more scar tissue from a week of suspense that's important right there we'll get back to it also during today's meeting President Trump was given a personal letter from Kim jong-un and the topic of this letter gave us one of the all-time great verbal u-turns of this still young presidency as the president describes the letter then says he hasn't opened the letter in two statements that were minutes apart a letter was given to me by Kim Jong Un's and that letter was very nice letter Oh would you like to see what was in that letter how much how much how much it was a very interesting letter at some point that maybe it may be appropriate and maybe I'll be able to give it to your belly did you send anything back no I didn't I haven't seen the letter yet I purposely didn't open the letter I haven't opened it I didn't open it in front of the director I said would you want me to open it you said you can read it later I may be in for a big surprise folks here at long last is a picture of the letter it is a giant letter in a giant novelty birthday card sized envelope prior to the president handling it it was tested for contaminants a subtle reminder of the kind of people we're dealing with here meanwhile defense secretary James Madison in Singapore today for a security summit with US allies in the region NBC News Pentagon correspondent Hans Nichols is there tonight part of our advance team on the ground he has an update on preparations for the North Korea summit and the defense Secretary's trip Ryan Singapore woke up this morning the very reality that there's going to be a summit here in just 10 days and that means there's some urgent tasks namely figuring out the logistics just where this summit is going to take place now there have been reports and local presses about the North Korean team and the US team shuttling around town there's speculation about where it might be the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino is just over here that's owned by Sheldon Adelson some of the speculation is centered on that hotel but beyond the logistics there the deliverables and I think what's important about that meeting between President trumpet is North Korean and Walker is just how long it took and then the speed with which mr. Trump made the decision to put that summit back on the velocity there was barely any time for costume consultations if this is a hurry-up city this is a no-huddle offense by the president he is clearly calling audibles the entire way now one consensually he potentially made was saying that you could have a formal peace treaty between North and South Korea and all the parties who were involved remember there was a UN mandate back in the 50s during the Korean War the issue there is that's something the South Koreans have desperately wanted as well as the North Koreans Trump didn't talk about complete and verifiable denuclearization and he went out of his way to say that you could take in the North Koreans could take their time my suspicion on this brine is that this backdrop is going to be a familiar scene we could have multiple summits and the urgent task now for everyone else is to figure out how to put both sides in a position to get to a deal whether that's on the 12th or going on one other note secretary Madison speaking this morning he likely had to scrub any reference to maximum pressure that's the idea that you had sanctions you had military assets that forced Kim Jungman to the table President Trump today saying that he no longer wanted to use that term although he did say sanctions are still in place and if talks go south they can always ratchet those up Brian need a scorecard to keep it all straight Hans Hans Nichols our NBC News Pentagon correspondent reporting for us from Singapore tonight with all that let's bring in our leadoff panel on a Friday night Jeremy bash back with us former chief of staff at the CIA and Pentagon also former counsel to House Intel Catherine Lucy's back with us White House reporter for The Associated Press and also Brian Bennett returns to the broadcast senior White House correspondent for Time magazine good evening and welcome to you all and Jeremy I'm going to begin with you is it still your first of all what's going on here subset question one is it still your contention that getting talks at all with the American president is baseline victory for the north and when the president talks about these talks maybe not being over in one session maybe several maybe weeks is that the kind of talks that should precede presidents sitting down at the table he always become clear today Brian if it wasn't clear before is that our president is an enormous ly ineffective negotiator he has made massive concessions even on the road to Singapore putting aside what he's actually gonna give up at the table across the table from kim jeong-hoon so first Brian he's caved twice on the idea of the summit first accepting the invitation outright initially without any consultations and without winning any concession and then once he canceled the summit he came the second time and they re accepted the invitation that was brought to him today to the Oval Office second is he said that the era of maximum pressure is over and as Hans noted in the setup piece that's caused the Pentagon to scrub all plans to put pressure on Korea and reassure our allies and third is he's he preys on the North Koreans he's called them honorable people he said doesn't want to speak ill of them at all this is a murderous thuggish regime and they have won a massive concession just by being in the Oval Office which hasn't happened in 20 years by standing next to the president we're gonna see more of that in spades next week in Singapore a regime where we always point out citizens have been forced to eat dirt while so much of the GNP goes into the development of a nuclear arms program hey Catherine you're very good at getting people to talk to you in this West Wing has anyone though admitted to you anyone of any rank and stature that the fear is we the president has already given too much and this is a slippery slope into Singapore I think the thing that we heard some going into the the last sort of roller coaster negotiations is there was concern with a lot of people on the president that expectations have been set very high for this meeting that you know the the the chatter about Nobel Prizes and the historic nature of the meeting and so I think some of what you were seeing today with the meeting back on is really an effort by the President to manage expectations you know is saying it's not gonna get fixed in one meeting there there may have to be more sessions you know that this this is a get-to-know-you plus and he said today so I think they are trying to set a tone you know to try to try and sort of ratchet down what can be done Brian in the moments it took me to walk into the studio one of our producers caught you on the phone and transcribed a line you told them which I'm sure you won't mind me reading aloud it was amazing for me to see a guy who recently was the head of the North Korean spy service walk out of the Oval Office and pose for pictures with the American president you said that as having been there today and witnessed it talk a little bit about that for members of our audience who may not be as struck as we are by the history of this and who this guy is well I just wanted yes step back for a moment to think about what happened today you had the number two ranking officials North Korea walk into the Oval Office spend more than an hour there with President from and this is a guy who was linked to a murderous attack on a a South Korean naval ship in 2010 that killed more than 40 South Korean sailors he was running the intelligence apparatus for one of the most if not the most oppressive regime in the entire world right now and and president Trump was even asked afterwards after the meeting after he shook hands with him if he had brought up human rights in their meeting president Trump said no and President Trump in the world walk up to this summit has repeatedly said that he doesn't want to challenge Kim Jong Un's ability to stay in power he solely focused on kim jong hoon giving up his nuclear weapons and that is just a very fascinating position for the american president to be in and we're gonna have to see how that plays out and how President Trump can use this leverage inside the negotiating room I know that aides are concerned that whatever preparations are made before Trump goes into that meeting that President Trump in order to get to a deal might be willing to give give up more than aides around him have prepared him for hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to
