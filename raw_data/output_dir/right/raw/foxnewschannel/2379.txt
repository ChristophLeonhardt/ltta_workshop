00:00:09,411 --> 00:00:10,706
FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES

3
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:11,864
COMEY IN AN INTERVIEW HERE

4
00:00:11,864 --> 00:00:12,708
ON "SPECIAL REPORT."

5
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,566
LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL

6
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:15,519
CATHERINE HERRIDGE FOX NEWS

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,133
CHIEF INTELLIGENCE

8
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:17,568
CORRESPONDENT.

9
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:18,169
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY SENIOR

10
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:19,572
EDITOR AT THE FEDERAL LIST.

11
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:21,400
MARLA LIASSON "NATIONAL

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,274

00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,223
DIGENOVA FORMER U.S.

14
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:24,620
ATTORNEY.

15
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,621
CATHERINE, FIRST TO YOU, YOU

16
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:26,877
HAVE COVERED THIS FOR A LONG

17
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:27,177
TIME.

18
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:27,823
WHAT STUCK OUT WITH YOU.

19
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:29,500
>> THE AMAZING EXCHANGE TO

20
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,134
ME IS WHEN YOU HAD DIRECTOR

21
00:00:31,134 --> 00:00:33,254
COMEY CONFIRM THAT HE SHARED

22
00:00:33,254 --> 00:00:35,357
THOSE MEMOS DOCUMENTING

23
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:35,936
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

24
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:36,788
PRESIDENT WITH THREE OTHER

25
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:38,039
PEOPLE SO THE COLUMBIA

26
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,235
PROFESSOR, THAT'S WHAT HE

27
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:41,242
TESTIFIED TO ALSO WHAT HE

28
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,693
DESCRIBED AS HIS PERSONAL

29
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:43,539
ATTORNEY PATRICK FITZGERALD

30
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:44,695
AND THEN THIS OTHER

31
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:45,047
ATTORNEY.

32
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:45,841
WHAT'S KEY HERE IS THAT HE

33
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:47,798
TOLD YOU, BRET, THAT THOSE

34
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,500
MEMOS WERE RETURNED TO THE

35
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,946
FBI AFTER THEY FOUND

36
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:52,047
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

37
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:53,649
HE CAN CALL IT WHATEVER HE

38
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:53,949
WANTS.

39
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:55,951
THAT IS A CLASSIFIED SPILL

40
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:56,707
OF INFORMATION.

41
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:57,507
DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THEY

42
00:00:57,507 --> 00:00:58,554
HAVE CLEARANCES.

43
00:00:58,554 --> 00:00:59,560
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY

44
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,261
TO SECURE THAT INFORMATION.

45
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:02,713
>> Bret: JOE?

46
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:04,714
>> I WAS AMAZED -- I THOUGHT

47
00:01:04,714 --> 00:01:07,569
IT WAS BREATH-TAKING

48
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,119
DUPLICITY.

49
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:08,741
AMERICA'S DIRTY COP

50
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:10,421
CONTINUES TO AMAZE ME WITH

51
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:11,767
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE

52
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,174
INSTITUTION THAT HE USED TO

53
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:13,626
LEAD.

54
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:15,777
AND WHAT CATHERINE HAS JUST

55
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:16,847
SAID IS STUNNING.

56
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:18,574
IT'S NOT HIS DECISION.

57
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:19,682
HE'S SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT'S

58
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:20,103
CLASSIFIED.

59
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:22,283
HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO

60
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:23,278
CLASSIFY UNDER THE LAW.

61
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:24,786
AND, YET, HE MAINTAINS THAT

62
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:26,582
HE DID NOT GIVE AWAY

63
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:27,282
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

64
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:28,440
HE LEAKED CLASSIFIED

65
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,167
INFORMATION TO THE "NEW YORK

66
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:29,485
TIMES."

67
00:01:29,485 --> 00:01:31,387
THAT'S A CRIME.

68
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:31,793
>> Bret: MARA?

69
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:33,342
>> I THINK THAT THE

70
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:34,390
DIFFICULTY THAT COMEY IS

71
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,491
HAVING IS THAT HE IS NOW IN

72
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:37,147
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ROLE.

73
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:39,149
AND HE CAN'T BE IN TWO ROLES

74
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:39,751
AT THE SAME TIME.

75
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,398
THE COMPLETELY IMPARTIAL LAW

76
00:01:42,398 --> 00:01:44,400
MAN WHO BELIEVES IN SERVING

77
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,578
THE PRESIDENCY AND THE

78
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:46,829
INSTITUTIONS AND NOW A

79
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:47,509
PARTISAN ACTOR.

80
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,061
AND THAT'S, I THINK, WHERE

81
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:51,128
THERE IS A LOT OF CONFLICT.

82
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:51,607
>> Bret: MOLLIE?

83
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:52,631
>> I THOUGHT HIS MOST

84
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:53,315
INTERESTING ANSWER IS WHEN

85
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:54,365
YOU ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD

86
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:55,817
STILL BE AT THE FBI IF HE

87
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:56,367
HADN'T BEEN FIRED.

88
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:57,687
HE SAID HE WOULD BE AND

89
00:01:57,687 --> 00:01:58,714
BECAUSE HE BELIEVED HIS JOB

90
00:01:58,714 --> 00:01:59,871
WAS TO PROTECT THE FBI.

91
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,316
I THINK THAT'S A VERY

92
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:01,940
TELLING STATEMENT THAT

93
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,773
SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS

94
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:04,276
SOMETHING OTHER THAN JUSTICE

95
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:06,021
THAT WAS HIS HIGH CONCERN

96
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:07,496
AND WHEN YOU WERE ASKING HIM

97
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:09,180
ABOUT WHY HE DIDN'T REVEAL

98
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,157
INFORMATION TO THE PRESIDENT

99
00:02:10,157 --> 00:02:11,433
ABOUT WHO FUNDED THE

100
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:13,482
DOSSIER, HE SEEMED TO BE

101
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:14,329
SHOCKINGLY UNINFORMED ABOUT

102
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:15,831
WHO FUNDED THE DOSSIER.

103
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:18,934
HE DID NOT -- HE, IN FACT,

104
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:20,440
ATTEMPTED TO DENY.

105
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,236
>> Bret: I WANT TO PLAY THE

106
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:22,337
SOUND BITE BECAUSE I WAS

107
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:23,839
PREPARED TO GO DOWN A

108
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:24,640
DIFFERENT ROAD AND THEN HE

109
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,444
SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW.

110
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:27,775
>> WHEN DID YOU LEARN THAT

111
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:29,099
THE DNC AND HILLARY CLINTON

112
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,300
CAMPAIGN HAD FUNDED

113
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,046
CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S WORK?

114
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:32,705
>> YEAH, I STILL DON'T KNOW

115
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:33,425
THAT FOR A FACT.

116
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:34,750
I KNEW IT WAS FUNDED FIRST

117
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,985
BY REPUBLICANS.

118
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:38,558
>> Bret: BUT THAT'S NOT

119
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:38,858
TRUE.

120
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:39,758
>> I'M SORRY?

121
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:40,656
>> Bret: THAT'S NOT TRUE THE

122
00:02:40,656 --> 00:02:41,812
DOSSIER THAT CHRISTOPHER

123
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:42,865
STEELE WORKED ON WAS FUNDED

124
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:43,487
BY REPUBLICANS.

125
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:44,560
>> MY UNDERSTANDING THE

126
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,566
ACTIVITY WAS BEGUN THAT

127
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,062
STEELE WAS HIRED TO LOOK

128
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:48,864
INTO WAS FIRST FUNDED BY

129
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:50,265
REPUBLICANS AND THEN PICKED

130
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:51,102
UP -- IMPORTANT THING WAS

131
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:52,367
PICKED UP BY DEMOCRATS

132
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:54,927
OPPOSED TO DONALD TRUMP.

133
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:55,471
>> Bret: CATHERINE?

134
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,597
>> ONE OF THE BASICS OF

135
00:02:56,597 --> 00:02:58,373
JOURNALISM AND ANY

136
00:02:58,373 --> 00:02:59,230
INVESTIGATION IS

137
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,132
UNDERSTANDING THE

138
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:00,776
CREDIBILITY OF THE SOURCE

139
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:02,377
AND THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T

140
00:03:02,377 --> 00:03:03,879
HAVE HIS ARMS AROUND WHAT

141
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,356
THE SOURCE WAS FROM THE

142
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:06,982
DOSSIER WAS REALLY KIND OF

143
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:07,583
CONFUSING TO ME.

144
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,240
AND THEN, JUST AS A FINAL

145
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,141
POINT, WHEN YOU ASKED HIM

146
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:12,744
ABOUT THAT BEING THE BASIS.

147
00:03:12,744 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Bret: FOR THE FIGHT
