the Harvey Weinstein scandal is an absolute Hollywood disgrace in the old days of Hollywood disgustingly corrupt producers use their positions to lure young actresses onto casting couches for sex in today's Hollywood disgustingly corrupt producers use their positions to lure young actresses into watching them take showers and play with themselves this shows what a decline there's been in the quality of disgustingly corrupt producers even worse Weinstein's perverse shenanigans indicate there is something wrong with the entire Democrat Party he supported before this we thought Democrats were just ordinary people trying to eviscerate the Constitution in the name of creeping socialism by buying the people's freedoms one by one with entitlement programs that crippled whole communities with dependency to a corrupt and incompetent government but now it turns out a nice girl can't be in a room along with them either for instance serial sex abuser Harvey Weinstein was a major donor to Hillary Clinton who has been married for more than 40 years to serial sex abuser Bill Clinton and his best friends with the wife of serial sex abuser Anthony Weiner none of these men was ever exposed by Hillary Clinton and there's even good reason to believe she helped cover up some of their crimes this means that all those loudmouth hysterical nasty women wearing stupid pink hats and protesting the fact that Donald Trump used to get handsy with beauty contestants were out there voting for Hillary the rapists small in my book this doesn't speak well for loudmouth hysterical nasty women wearing stupid pink hats in fact I think it's fair to say we should all stop listening to what loudmouth hysterical nasty women wearing stupid pink hats say to us but then that would put an end to the entire feminist movement speaking of feminists the feminists are saying that the Harvey Weinstein scandal shows what a terrible problem there is with men there's a good reason they say that the reason is that everything feminists say is wrong Harvey Weinstein is not a man he's a creep men do their best to protect women sometimes they do this by punching creeps like Harvey Weinstein if you teach your sons not to be manly there will be no one left to punch creeps like Harvey Weinstein or Bill Clinton or Anthony Weiner then what are you left with that's right the Democrat Party and believe me no one wants that trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and you can watch the Andrew Clavin show right here at the Daily wire Monday through Thursday
