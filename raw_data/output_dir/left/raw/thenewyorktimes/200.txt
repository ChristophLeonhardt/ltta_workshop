00:00:00,561 --> 00:00:01,060
Hi.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,070
My name’s David Leitch.

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,040
I’m the director
of “Deadpool 2."

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,750
So here we have a scene where
Deadpool has joined the X-Men.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,270
It’s sort of a pivotal
point in the film,

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,190
a lot of story arcs
coming together,

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,050
and he’s with his new crew.

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,260
And you can see him
in his trainee jersey.

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,240
That was sort of
a choice we made.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,600
Instead of giving
him an X-Men suit.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,610
Actually, he’s got
some learning to do

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,190
on the processes of
what the X-Men do

13
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,650
and what he thinks the X-Men do.

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,362
"— like Beyonce says, 'please,
please stop cheating on me.'"

15
00:00:36,362 --> 00:00:36,960
"Hey!"

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,670
You might think some
of this is improv,

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,930
but it really comes from a
well-crafted script, written

18
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,040
by Rhett Reese, Paul
Wernick and Ryan Reynolds.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,200
And you really just sort
of have to be precise

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,080
and true to that bible
as you’re doing this.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,700
"I’ll ask the questions.

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,030
Let me talk to the kid.

23
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,730
You stay here with your
weird secret sex lips."

24
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,319
Julian Dennison becomes sort
of the key part of the plot.

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,150
And it’s going to be his
relationship with Deadpool that

26
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,660
sort of drives the engine
of the movie moving forward.

27
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,790
"Hi, there."

28
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,117
"Stay back or Justin Bieber dies."

29
00:01:17,117 --> 00:01:17,616
"Ha!

30
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:18,370
Justin Bieber.

31
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,010
He called you Justin Bieber."

32
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,590
We do set up some conflict
between their styles

33
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,390
and how Deadpool approaches
fighting justice,

34
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,720
and the X-Men fight justice.

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,580
"Firefist?

36
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,179
Ooh, that’s a great name.

37
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:33,970
Where does it burn?

38
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,980
Just the fist, or all
the way up to the elbow?"

39
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,057
I work closely with my
cinematographer, Jonathan Sela,

40
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:42,640
to block these scenes, because
there’s so much stuff going on.

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,590
I mean, you have
visual effects, you

42
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,676
have comedic tone
you’re dealing with,

43
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:48,550
you have a dramatic tone
you’re dealing with.

44
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,580
I think blocking is
a key part of this.

45
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,410
It’s a pretty good example of
Deadpool process in a nutshell.

46
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,510
[grunting]

47
00:02:00,910 --> 00:00:00,000
"Oh."
