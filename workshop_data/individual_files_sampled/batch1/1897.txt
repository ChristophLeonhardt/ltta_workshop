dubai is identified as a real-estate money-laundering hub a new report says it's a haven for war pop tears financiers of terror and drug traffickers despite US sanctions so what's the government doing about it and what's the security risk for devised neighbors this is inside story hello and welcome to the program today with me Peter Dhabi now with its skyscrapers luxury villas and a high concentration of millionaires and billionaires Dubai's rise to global city and business hub captured the world's attention it's one of seven emirates that make up the united arab emirates an absolute monarchy long ruled by the Al Maktoum family Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum its ruler is the driving force behind the rapid development of the city making it one of the fastest growing economies in the world Dubai maintained its importance as a main trade route particularly for gold through the 70s and 80s and as an oil-rich city didn't rely only on its revenues but diversified its economy the service and tourism sectors helped accelerate its growth Dubai is now famous for its huge property projects and world sporting events so what's behind Dubai is real estate boom while the washington-based Center for Advanced Defense studies which goes under the acronym c4 ATS has obtained leaked property data from the city-state and it's found that those who make money out of war financed terror or who are involved in drug trafficking used to bias real estate market as a haven for money laundering its report identified around 100 million dollars in what it's described as suspicious purchases of apartments including million-dollar villas on the Palm Jumeirah and the Burj Khalifa the center says Dubai has what it calls 8 lakhs regulatory environment where secrecy and anonymity are prized above all else among individuals named in the report are Rami Makhlouf a cousin of the Syrian President Bashar al-assad and a Lebanese businessman Kamel and Assam AM has sanctioned by the u.s. in 2014 for helping Hezbollah it also identified some 21 million dollars in real estate held by individuals associated with the Althoff Kanani money laundering organization a Pakistani ring that aided drug traffickers and groups like Al Qaeda through its currency exchange houses okay let's bring in our guests here on Inside Story from Berlin we're going to be joined by Casey Kelso advocacy director at Transparency International who also co leads the global antic corruption consortium from London Andrea's Creek assistant professor at the defense studies department at King's College London and from Copenhagen on skype Laurent lambier senior policy analyst for the Social and Economic Survey Research Institute at Qatar University thank you and welcome to all of you for joining us Casey coming to you first just paint us a fiscal picture legal or illegal of how they do what they do in Dubai well it's very interesting to read the revelations that came out of the leak that Seifer ABS had received the organized crime and corruption reporting project this journalist networks sent in a journalist to find out how exactly does it work what is the mechanisms they found that they preferred cash in suitcases if you want or wired that most of the real estate agents said that there was no checks there was no need to do any sort of filling out of paperwork that take care of that for them that in particular they did not disclose need to disclose their owner of a beneficial owner of the the company that would buy so you could use a shell company to buy rather than in your individual names you could hide who it was that was buying some of the property so the leak was quite important some fifty eight thousand properties a hundred and twenty nine thousand people from a hundred and eighty four countries they went through with a fine-tooth comb and found different people who had an unsavory background have bought multimillion-dollar properties do we know who leaked the information and why they wanted to leak the information we don't know why the information was leaked but we do know that from many times like in the Panama papers it can be people who want to stop the the merry-go-round from going further in particular the OCC RP this journalist network had sent in someone that said that they were sick and tired of watching what happened with these failed deals in one case in particular you transfer in you buy four buildings then you cancel one week later and then the money is then laundered because it's gone through the central bank it's now clean money and everyone gets a cut and money is returned back and the buildings are not sold this property real estate dealer said he was just really tired of watching this sort of fiddling going on with a business of selling real estate andreas in London is part of the issue here that there's never been a correctly built system of juda legions when it comes to the different financial aspects of dealing with these large amounts of money that that's kind of reported upwards that there's no umbrella organization here yes exactly and that's the problem I mean this is a problem of the globalized world that we that we live in Dubai has marketed itself as a global hub a global city within glue which is at the center of a lot of global networks that spend the entire the entire world so we have gemstones and and and diamond dealers who are linked in to West Africa who launder their money there we have drug and narcotics dealers from Latin America who launder their money there we have people from the Middle East all over the Middle East of whether there are regimes part of both return regimes or other non-state actors are laundering money there this is an 8 this is the nature of the globalized world where we have networked societies and global networks that all come together in one single hub and the hub in this case is Dubai very difficult to actually clamp down on it and this is some of the issues we've had in the past with terror financing in the Gulf all relate to the same issue that it's very difficult that there is not one enforcement mechanism globally that actually clamp down on it but what's important to note here is that if sanctions are in place and they're on place on many of these individuals that appear in this report it's important that nation-states enforce these sanctions coherently and if one city-state such as Dubai decides not to do that it creates a loophole where a lot of these individuals now can go and can go to and launder their money whereby other doors in other countries might have been shut and and I think this is the problem because it undermines the nature of an international sanctions regime and it somewhat undermines the the clamp down that there exists in other countries on these kind of illicit networks for the most part being a listed at networks because they can just go somewhere else and if one door opens they all flood to that one door and this one door has for very long time has been divided Laura Lambie in Copenhagen it's perhaps worth mentioning at this point in the program that the officially the government of Dubai has said nothing about this we don't know if they will at some point in the future or not have any individuals as far as you're concerned Laurent or as far as you have heard have any individuals or separate companies been charged with anything here and if they have what was the tariff I mean what do they have to pay what what do they have to go through I'm not sure if I understood correctly your question but if you're asking whether some people have been charged for money laundering in the United Arab Emirates we do not have as far as I know any case where people from let's say Central Asia from where for the last two decades there has been money laundering from drugs for instance we don't have any strong case of people who have been in dicted who have been arrested or who the money has been frozen for money laundering money in Dubai other united arab emirates we have cases of people arrested for terrorism charges of terrorism but not generally related to the real estate the real estate is sort of a case a part of the rest once in Dubai you're not dealing with the national security of the United Arab Emirates generally this is a very very liberal economy and there are very very few our stations unless there is a clear mandate coming from Interpol that says these people will land in the United Arab Emirates I don't foresee any arrest technician related to money laundering in the real estate of do I or the United Arab Emirates for that matter Casey it seems like a very complex almost like a three-dimensional spider's web here because it goes to mexico it goes to pakistan it goes to Afghanistan we've got the report that I read today was talking about to golfing projects that bear the logo of the Trump Organization there was also talk about a carrousel scheme a few years involving London and Switzerland the banking sector in Switzerland as well are we saying that everyone involved in this is consciously corrupt I mean one of the reports talks about wealthy Russians literally getting off a plane with bags of cash buying apartments they never live in the apartments they seldom see them then they get on an Emirates flight and they fly out of Dubai are we saying that every individual is corrupt or are they unknowingly taking part in this I think it's really hard to say who is corrupt and who is not I think that that the the difficulty is that with the terrible or that the really enormous secrecy that's given in Dubai as long as well as the the permissiveness that rules that are good on paper are not enforced as diligently as you'd want it's hard to untangle and a lot of the grand corruption cases that transparency international sees have their tracks that go into Dubai and then it's a black box you can't get much action there in terms of asset freezes for example so while London used to be a capital of corrupt corruption it used to take a lot of the dirty money as London has then adopted like a public beneficial ownership register that says that people who come in and do business there and have companies they have to have an actual physical human name attached to each of those companies then the the dirty money goes elsewhere and it looks like Dubai will profit from what from London tightening up its own money Lonnie regulations so whether it's the former Prime Minister of Thailand or the former president of South Africa or the former first lady of Zimbabwe they all have their houses there now is that dirty money it's hard to tell unless you can go in and have the authorities there start doing investigations of where did the money come from was this a suspicious suspicious transaction was there a actual physical cash that was delivered there that's something for the do by authorities to answer andreas just some of this go back as a tipping points 2002 when the government decided you can buy a freehold property so instead of buying a leasehold property were you in effect by 99 years of a box of air which is occupied by an apartment say you're actually buying the freehold you own the land on which the villa sits so in terms of what the paperwork says when you sign it that makes it easier for you if you want to do bad things with lots of money yes and I agree with my previous speakers he I mean London has a similar reputation has a similar problem that people who make money especially Russia and in other countries and they feel there or in China and feel that their money is not safe in their home country they go and park it relatively safely in in London it doesn't necessarily mean that this money is dirty or not but that's a different story in in Dubai similar mechanism the the difference to London though is that in Dubai the entire business model has been built on being a free port being a free hub attracting business attracting investments and interacting attracting investments no matter where they come from and that has been a business model that goes back to the 19th century into Byway it was the first free port in this part of the world in the Gulf and knowingly Dubai has been always a trading hub unlike Abu Dhabi and other Emirates and other states in the region Dubai was never really rich in oil and gas so it was never the a very lucrative rentee estate in the same way that Abu Dhabi was for example so Dubai very early on invested into building a service economy tried to build trying to diversify away from the hydrocarbons and one way of doing this is becoming a trading hub attracting investments into the country no matter where they came from and by being so open about this they were able to attract funds that other countries were not able to attract because there was no due diligence there was no monitoring and there still is no monitoring and to be honest the the very integrity and of the economy of Dubai and the the resilience of Dubai if you will depends to a great deal on attracting these kind of investments because for the rest I mean the Dubai is very much dependent on money coming from Abu Dhabi and so for Dubai to survive this business model has to survive and we shouldn't forget the the Al Maktoum family is profiting from this as well the the ruling family of Dubai and they've been a lot of there's a lot of evidence for example that the Emirates Postal Service and their own exchange Burroughs for example a currency exchange Burroughs were involved in kind of money laundering schemes and that was happening right under the nose of those rulers of Dubai and that in many ways has gone against the interest of the aliens who are ruling the United Arab Emirates and ruling up with a be so policy knob with a be and policy in Dubai are not always the same thing and they go in this case into opposite direction particular when we see how Abu Dhabi's clamping down on my own finances coming from Iran whereby Dubai is the hub for the Iranian regime to basically circumvent the sanctions of the of recent years and for individuals that are sanctioned in Iran are doing business and parking their money in Dubai although Abu Dhabi has a very anti Iranian policy so there's a bit of this bipolarity in the United Arab Emirates clearly Lauren Lam bear in Copenhagen the regulatory system as it stands at the moment needs to get better at doing what it does I mean officially since 2002 I think twice the government said we are going to do that we are going to get better at this but within that chain what is the weakest link so if you wanted to launder money what would be the thing you would do or the regulatory part of the system that you would go to to get what you want well it really depends on which kind of investment we're speaking about if we are speaking about you know someone who is investing some little money doesn't seem to be a big corporation investing millions of pounds you don't need to go for the same kind of checking's that if you really have millions of pounds coming and especially they are coming in cash you know obviously regulations as to the transport transportation of money and large sums of money as it was said before you have and this has been an ongoing for decades you have to Dubai planes coming with mallets full of cash this is something that should not be acceptable there should be more inspections it's not perfect but in Europe for instance airports and especially private airports have a responsibility to investigate some of the flights which can seem to be a bit bizarre landing at night leaving just a few hours after these kind of flights which can by the way smuggle weapons drugs or human you know trafficking these are the kind of flights which are not so much investigated as long as the people have apparently money to buy the willingness of the bankers and the authorities they might even have political support it's not so difficult to have residency in Dubai once you have money so it can become very easy for someone who tries to money launderer money from a number of places including South Asia very importantly but also Central Asia Iran and a number of places it's pretty easy to get a residency as long as they have enough money and there is not enough investigation and here I would like to highlight a paradox Dubai has a very sophisticated a government platform is doing very well international ranking for its online platforms and it's easier vs. so there is on one hand a very sophisticated government portal and there is on the other hand a problem a create problem as it has been noticed rated by this report with regards to investigating where the money comes from and so we cannot say that this is a small country a developing country because on one hand it has the resources and it has resources also for policy matters and also to to crash its internal political opposition it should be said so the same kind of resources is never used to investigate the origin of the funding as long as the money is invested in the real estate this is a key concern not many report that could be de that could be done first and foremost regulations as to how the money can enter the country this is very important point Casey I think you wanted to come in there oh just to say that the key point as well is I think that what the speaker is saying is is correct that looking at if you're looking for loopholes in your question one of the things that it is the money coming in but it's for real estate what we've seen is a pattern of real estate being quite key in money laundering time and time again if you're going to try to get a profit off of the money if you're going to park it somewhere if you want to keep its value whether it's Russians or its people from China who are fleeing and trying to take out their assets they're trying to put it into real estate and that combination as the speaker said that you can actually get a visa a residency in in Dubai and then if I be able then to have that ability to reside there and escape law it's the real estate in particular that is a key thing and it's not just Dubai tea I had done before a review of how the UK Australia Canada and the United Kingdom each had this flaw a fatal flaw on the real estate sector in particular so you can regulate the banks you might be able to regulate then the airports but you have to try to get the people who are selling the properties to be able to have a fit and proper test to make sure they know what is their money laundering responsibilities to report a suspicious transaction so as it sits the key part is the real estate agents in particular property that it sold understand that let's just put that point to andreas andreas if you put together the fact that there are 5000 multinational companies now registered in Dubai with the e platform issues that Lauren Lambie R was talking about there do you have to get Dubai to move to a situation like they have in the UK where they have a national intelligence agency that takes an overarching responsibility for all the individual bits of the jigsaw that would end up with due diligence hmm absolutely but I think it's agree with the the speaker from Denmark here it is an it's not an issue of capacity and capability or resources it is a problem of willingness as I said before this is a business model and it is the business model that works very well for Dubai so I don't think there is the willingness to actually clamp down on this and create this because we don't let's not forget the United Arab Emirates are a surveillance state in many ways they have superior monitoring capabilities about money going in money money coming at going out where it comes from who is it coming from you know they have clamped down on all kinds of threats domestically what they consider to be terrorism but the way they consider and define terrorism is always in reference to their own national security they don't always abide by international standards and because they're very selective so if people bring in money people like the Marlow family for example which very much help the Assad families stay afloat financially if they park their money in Dubai this is something and they don't clamp down on because it's not a threat to national security so it's really about the monitoring and the UAE are very very good if you in on monitoring if you come to Dubai and by the time you leave to buy you probably being filmed by over a thousand security cameras so they have they have all kinds of profiling for people coming in and the intelligence services work very very well when it's served their national security interests they're very quick in arresting people and putting people away or denying people entry into the country you know they've been loads of academics for example wanted to come to Dubai but they have said something bad about the UAE before they were not allowed to enter so if you have a willingness to clamp down they can do it the problem here is I don't think there is the willingness to do it very briefly because we are coming to the end of the program Laura lambier what are the chances that they introduce into by another monitoring system say for example such as they have in America if you and I are Americans and I give you more than one cent more than ten thousand US dollars that blips on somebody's radar and I have to fill in a piece of paperwork online that says why I'm doing it what are the chances they bring that in well it's very unlikely in the near future it's very honest I don't foresee it in the near future because they are depending on the knowing oil economy to keep on increasing because they are completely running out of oil they used to have little they have almost nothing left there are net importers of natural gas their energy security is a key concern now I would like to be fair with Dubai Dubai as it was said is not the only country which has problems with money laundering the real place tank and there is another problem is that the real estate has also many salt across the planet by the way you can find it in France in Europe in the United States and so on the real estate is generally a sector sort of protected at least by the governments which turn a blind eye on for instance moonlighting people who are illegal residents but who work in the construction sector in this feeding the construction industry and be real estate so I would like to say that this is a broader problem Dubai of course is a key case in point in terms of turning a blonde eyed on money laundering sometimes of coming from drugs and tourism but I would like to say that this is a broad problem and this needs to be addressed because we don't know also what are the conditions of building this real estate and we don't know a lot of things about that and I think increased transparency in Dubai and elsewhere is very much something we need to see coming in the years to come gentlemen an interesting
