1
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:03,002
HIMSELF BUT MAYBE PRIMARILY FOR 

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:03,335
HIS BROTHERS. 

3
00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:05,171
>> DOUG, LET'S TALK A LITTLE 

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:05,805
BIT ABOUT THAT. 

5
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:09,242
FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT KNOW 

6
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:13,513
HIS STORY, YOU KNOW, HE COMES 

7
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,514
FROM A MILITARY FAMILY. 

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,849
AND HE GRADUATED FROM THE 

9
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,784
MILITARY ACADEMY ALMOST AT THE 

10
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:18,952
BOTTOM OF HIS CLASS. 

11
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,320
HE WASN'T A STELLAR STUDENT AT 

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,489
ALL BUT WHEN HE WENT TO VIETNAM 

13
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,091
HE WASN'T THERE VERY LONG 

14
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,693
BEFORE HE CHEATED DEATH ONCE 

15
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,128
VERY QUICKLY AND THEN SHORTLY 

16
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,596
AFTER THAT BECAME A PRISONER OF 

17
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:29,796
WAR. 

18
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,833
CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 

19
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,100
THAT? 

20
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,367
>> YEAH. 

21
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,935
THERE WAS NO GUARANTY THAT ANY 

22
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:40,507
OF THOSE MEN WERE GOING TO 

23
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:40,707
LIVE. 

24
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,942
AND YOU'LL REMEMBER JEREMIAH 

25
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,278
DENTON WHEN THEY WERE SHOWING 

26
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:49,382
THESE PROPAGANDA MOVIES TO THE 

27
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,583
WORLD THEY WERE DENYING TORTURE 

28
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,186
AND JEREMIAH DENTON BLINKED 

29
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,522
WITH HIS EYES IN MORSE CODE 

30
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,157
TORTURE AND THAT VIDEO WAS 

31
00:00:58,157 --> 00:00:59,525
QUIETLY SHOWN IN EMBASSIES 

32
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:02,896
AROUND THE WORLD THAT THE 

33
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:03,530
VIETNAMESE WERE INDEED 

34
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,596
TORTURING THESE MEN. 

35
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:07,367
IF YOU READ THE PASSING OF THE 

36
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,335
NIGHT THE RANDOM HOUSE BOOK BY 

37
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,470
GENERAL ROBINSON RISER TO GIVE 

38
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,772
YOU AN IDEA OF THE DEPTH OF THE 

39
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,641
TYPE OF TORTURE THEY WENT 

40
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,909
THROUGH AND THERE WAS EVERY 

41
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,310
LIKELIHOOD THAT JOHN MCCAIN WAS 

42
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,645
GOING TO DIE THERE FAR AWAY 

43
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,680
FROM THE PEOPLE THAT HE LOVED. 

44
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,849
IT WAS A REAL MIRACLE HOW THE 

45
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,817
WAR ENDED AND THOSE PRISONERS 

46
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:26,820
OF WAR WERE RESCUED AND THEY 

47
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,153
DIDN'T KNOW. 

48
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,521
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE 

49
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,522
AMERICANS STILL CARED ABOUT 

50
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,926
THEM AND WERE WORKING TO BRING 

51
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,293
THEM HOME. 

52
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,528
SO IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT 

53
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,932
THEY WENT THROUGH BUT IT'S A 

54
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,233
GREAT STORY OF A VERY 

55
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:40,600
COURAGEOUS MAN. 

56
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,734
>> I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE OF 

57
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,870
WHAT WE ARE WATCHING RIGHT 

58
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,070
HERE. 

59
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,572
THE SENATOR'S BODY HAS LEFT THE 

60
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,474
CAPITAL BUILDING IN PHOENIX AND 

61
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,810
IS HEADING TO THE NORTH PHOENIX 

62
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,911
BAPTIST CHURCH WHERE THERE WILL 

63
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,180
BE A CEREMONY A LITTLE BIT 

64
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,447
LATER ON. 

65
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,416
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WILL 

66
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,485
BE SPEAKING AT THAT CEREMONY 

67
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:03,056
ALONG WITH LARRY FITZGERALD AND 

68
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:03,756
ARIZONA CARDINALS PLAYER. 

69
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:04,490
BUT ALSO VICE PRESIDENT DAN 

70
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,526
QUAIL WILL BE THERE 24 SITTING 

71
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,627
SENATORS WILL BE THERE AS WELL 

72
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,596
AS FOUR FORMER SENATORS AND OF 

73
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:14,133
COURSE FAMILY MEMBERS AND 

74
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:14,868
FRIENDS OF THE MCCAIN FAMILY. 

75
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:19,339
AFTER THAT THE BODY WILL BE 

76
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:19,705
MOVING ON. 

77
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:21,641
HE'LL BE TRANSPORTED HEADING TO 

78
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,942
WASHINGTON D.C. BUT THIS IS AN 

79
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,110
OPPORTUNITY OVER THE PAST 

80
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,312
COUPLE OF DAYS FOR THE STATE OF 

81
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:30,950
ARIZONA TO SAY THEIR FINAL 

82
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,784
GOODBYES TO THEIR SENATOR. 

83
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:36,723
HE HAS REPRESENTED THEIR STATE 

84
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:37,056
FOR DECADES. 

85
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,392
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LINED UP. 

86
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,728
WE ARE GETTING A NUMBER BETWEEN 

87
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:42,728
1 AND 15,000 PEOPLE WALKING 

88
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:47,000
PAST HIS BODY IN THE CAPITAL 

89
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,267
BUILDING. 

90
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,868
JUST TO SAY GOODBYE BUT ALSO TO 

91
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,303
SHARE STORIES WITH EACH OTHER 

92
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,672
AND AT ONE POINT SOME OF HIS 

93
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,339
CHILDREN ARRIVED AND THEY WERE 

94
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,541
ABLE TO SAY THANK YOU TO HIS 

95
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,776
CHILDREN AND TALK ABOUT JUST 

96
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,646
HOW IMPORTANT HE WAS TO THE 

97
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,113
STATE OF ARIZONA BUT ALSO TO 

98
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:01,648
THEM PERSONALLY. 

99
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,551
SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE WATCHING 

100
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:04,851
RIGHT NOW. 

101
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,952
THE MOTORCADE TRANSPORTING THE 

102
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,989
BODY OF JOHN MCCAIN TO THE 

103
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:10,823
NORTH PHOENIX BAPTIST CHURCH. 

104
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,992
AND I'M TALKING TO DOUG WEED, 

105
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,261
HISTORIAN ABOUT THE LEGACY OF 

106
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:15,895
THIS GREAT MAN. 

107
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,263
I JUST--YOU KNOW, WHEN I THINK 

108
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,066
OF HIM I JUST THINK OF SORT OF 

109
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,536
THE BEST DEFINITION OF WHAT WE 

110
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,837
EXPECT AN AMERICAN TO BE. 

111
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,739
YOU KNOW, YOU TALKED ABOUT WHEN 

112
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,942
HE WAS A PRISONER OF WAR. 

113
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:31,477
HE HAD LEFT BEHIND A NEW WIFE, 

114
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,812
A YOUNG DAUGHTER AT THE TIME 

115
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,481
AND HE DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY 

116
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,283
TO JUMP IN FRONT OF OTHER 

117
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,585
AMERICANS AND COME HOME BEFORE 

118
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:42,755
THEM AND HE SAID NO. 

119
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:43,256
>> YEAH. 

120
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,791
HE DIDN'T DO IT. 

121
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,627
THAT'S A PRETTY AMAZING MOMENT 

122
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,262
AND ANNE-MARIE REMEMBER, I 

123
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,430
REITERATE THIS POINT. 

124
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,765
WHEN HE MADE THAT DECISION, 

125
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,533
THERE WAS EVERY LIKELIHOOD THAT 

126
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:56,202
HE WAS SIGNING HIS OWN DEATH 

127
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,104
WARRANT AT THE TIME AND HE KNEW 

128
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,841
IT BUT HE WOULDN'T GIVE THE 

129
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,476
NORTH VIETNAMESE EVEN THAT 

130
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,043
SMALL PROPAGANDA VICTORY. 

131
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,713
AND I THINK PART OF THAT WAS 

132
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:11,584
THE EXPERIENCE HE HAD WITH HIS 

133
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,519
FATHER AND GRANDFATHER. 

134
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,421
IT WAS A MOMENT, A TRANSCENDENT 

135
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,789
MOMENT WHERE HE SUDDENLY BECAME 

136
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,524
EVERY BIT AS GOOD AND AS GREAT 

137
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,858
AS THE MEN THAT HE HAD HEARD 

138
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,563
ABOUT ALL HIS LIFE AS A LITTLE 

139
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:23,763
BOY. 

140
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,833
>> YEAH THIS WAS A FAMILY THAT 

141
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,901
FOR THIS FAMILY'S SERVICE TO 

142
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,739
COUNTRY BUT SERVICE TO OTHERS 

143
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,606
WAS SORT OF THE HIGHEST 

144
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,341
ACHIEVEMENT THAT'S PART OF WHAT 

145
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,076
MILITARY SERVICE WAS FOR JOHN 

146
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,747
MCCAIN BUT THEN WHEN THERE WAS 

147
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:41,814
NO LONGER MILITARY SERVICE, HE 

148
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,917
CHOSE TO SERVE THIS COUNTRY AS 

149
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:45,385
A POLITICIAN. 

150
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,121
CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 

151
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:52,158
WHAT SERVICE MEANT TO HIM 

152
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,793
BECAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE 

153
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,461
ENTERPOLITICS FOR ALL SORTS OF 

154
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,697
REASONS NOW SOME OF THEM NOT SO 

155
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,866
HONORABLE BUT IT CERTAINLY 

156
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,067
SEEMS LIKE JOHN MCCAIN WAS 

157
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,870
DRIVEN BY A DESIRE TO IMPROVE 

158
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,438
THOSE AROUND HIM, IMPROVE THE 

159
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,839
LIVES OF THOSE AROUND HIM. 

160
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,342
>> YEAH I DON'T WANT TO 

161
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,310
EXAGGERATE THAT BECAUSE HE WAS 

162
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,112
A SUPERB POLITICIAN AND LIKE 

163
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,948
ALL POLITICIANS TO SURVIVE IN 

164
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,484
WASHINGTON D.C., HE HAD HIS 

165
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,285
FAVORITE. 

166
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,120
THE FAVORITE CORPORATIONS AND 

167
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,488
THE FAVORITE LOBBYISTS THAT HE 

168
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:26,092
WORKED WITH BUT HE WOULD OFTEN 

169
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,427
GO AGAINST THE GRAIN AND 

170
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:31,931
TOTALLY DEFY THEM AND TAKE A 

171
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,401
DIFFERENT TACK IN THAT SENSE 

172
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,203
HIS INTEGRITY WOULD TRIUMPH 

173
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,572
OVER A VERY USEFUL POLITICAL 

174
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,842
CHANCE TO IMPROVE HIS OWN 

175
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,142
STANDING. 

176
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:47,580
SO IT'S SOMETHING OF A 

177
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,016
PHENOMENON HOW HE ROSE TO THE 

178
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,884
TOP AND RAN FOR PRESIDENT TWICE 

179
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,553
AND ALMOST WON. 

180
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,022
ALMOST BECAME A PRESIDENT. 

181
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,289
>> YEAH. 

182
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,390
YOU MENTIONED THE KEETING FIVE. 

183
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,125
WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIS LONG 

184
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,593
CAREER AS A POLITICIAN THERE'S 

185
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,094
TWO AREAS THAT JUMP OUT AS 

186
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:04,364
PERHAPS AREAS THAT HE MIGHT 

187
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,631
HAVE THOUGHT WERE MISS STEPS. 

188
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,468
THE SAVING AND LOAN SCANDAL 

189
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,670
WITH THE KEETING FIVE AND THE 

190
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,072
CHOICE OF SARAH PALIN AS A VICE 

191
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,909
PRESIDENT RUNNING MATE BUT HE 

192
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:24,183
LEARNED A LOT. 

193
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:28,254
HE WAS INVESTIGATED AND HE WAS 

194
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:28,687
JUDGED POLITICALLY. 

195
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:29,689
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT 

196
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,290
CHAPTER OF HIS CAREER MEANT TO 

197
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,459
HIM AND WHAT HE LEARNED FROM 

198
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:33,893
IT. 

199
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,528
>> ANNE-MARIE THAT'S SUCH A 

200
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,663
DRAMATIC MOVING STORY TO ME 

201
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,499
THAT I ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT IT 

202
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,500
TO MY CHILDREN AND MY 

203
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:41,867
GRANDCHILDREN. 

204
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:46,506
I USE IT AS A LIFE EXPERIENCE 

205
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,439
FOR THEM BECAUSE THE KEETING 

206
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,010
FIVE WENT TO THE PRISON OF THE 

207
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,145
FIVE SENATORS THREE OF THEIR 

208
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,079
CAREERS WERE ABSOLUTELY CUT 

209
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,780
SHORT TWO OTHERS AND ONE OF 

210
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,849
THEM BEING MCCAIN CONTINUED TO 

211
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,318
SURVIVE AND HAVE A CAREER BUT 

212
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,686
HIS NAME WAS BLACKENED. 

213
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,054
THIS WAS FRAUD. 

214
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,089
THIS WAS A GREAT CONTROVERSY. 

215
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:11,531
IT RUINED THE CAREERS OF MANY 

216
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,066
PEOPLE ALL AROUND CREATING. 

217
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,067
JOHN MCCAIN CAREFULLY 

218
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,303
LABORIOUSLY TEDIOUSLY DAY BY 

219
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:21,774
DAY, STEP BY STEP REBUILT HIS 

220
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:26,145
LIFE BACK FROM THE KEETING FIVE 

221
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:26,946
VANDAL TO BECOME KNOWN TO 

222
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,981
BECOME FAMOUS AS A PERSON OF 

223
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,284
INTEGRITY TO THE POINT THEY 

224
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,852
CALLED HIS BUS DURING THE 

225
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,020
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN THE 

226
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,755
STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS TO THE 

227
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,089
POINT THAT HE REACHED ACROSS 

228
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,791
THE AISLE AND WAS THE ONLY ONE 

229
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,594
ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE THAT 

230
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,062
COULD HELP THE DEMOCRATS COME 

231
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:47,333
UP WITH A PROGRAM TO REFORM 

232
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:47,733
CAMPAIGN FINANCE. 

233
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:48,568
THAT IS A MARVELOUS MOMENT AND 

234
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,437
I TELL MY CHILDREN AND I TELL 

235
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,605
MY GRANDCHILDREN WHEN SOMETHING-

236
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,540
-WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG OR 

237
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,210
SOMETHING HURTS YOU OR YOU ARE 

238
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,544
PERCEIVED TO HAVE DONE 

239
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,779
SOMETHING WRONG IT ISN'T FATAL. 

240
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,448
IF YOU ARE NOT DEAD IT'S NOT 

241
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,051
FATAL AND THE GREAT EXAMPLE OF 

242
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,386
THAT IS JOHN MCCAIN WHO BECAME 

243
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,422
THE VERY OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE 

244
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,524
STORY OF THE CREATING FIVE 

245
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,692
SEEMED TO SAY. 

246
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,893
>> DEFINITELY TRUE. 

247
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,428
WE PLAYED AN INTERVIEW WITH 

248
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,965
LINDSAY GRAHAM A LITTLE BIT 

249
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:19,632
EARLIER TODAY. 

250
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,700
JOHN DICKERSON DID. 

251
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,668
AND JOHN ASKED HIM, LINDSAY 

252
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,235
GRAHAM WHAT SENATOR MCCAIN 

253
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:25,071
WOULD BE SAYING TO HIM RIGHT 

254
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,473
NOW AND HE SAID SENATOR MCCAIN 

255
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,708
WOULD BE SAYING BUCK UP, RIGHT? 

256
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:39,217
THAT--AND ALSO THAT YOU ARE 

257
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:39,751
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF. 

258
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:43,523
ASKS ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE 

259
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,658
SAY THAT IS REFRESHING AS A 

260
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,960
POLITICIAN IS TO SAY I MADE A 

261
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,528
MISTAKE AND DID SOMETHING WRONG 

262
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,596
AND ATTEMPT TO CORRECT IT. 

263
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:54,266
I WONDER HOW HE FELT ABOUT 

264
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,535
THESE--NOT THAT THESE PROBABLY 

265
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,037
GO TOGETHER POTENTICALLY BUT 

266
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,372
HIS TWO ATTEMPTS TO BECOME THE 

267
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,675
PRESIDENT FIRST BEATEN AT THE 

268
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:15,621
PRIMARY LEVEL BY GEORGE ATTEMPT 

269
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,089
BECOME THE PRESIDENT MEANT TO 

270
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,157
HIM, EVEN IN THOSE LOSSES? 

271
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:22,828
>> I NEVER TALKED TO HIM ABOUT 

272
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,264
THAT, BUT I KNOW HOW BIRTHER 

273
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,999
POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS CAN BE. 

274
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,234
-- HOW BITTER POLITICAL 

275
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:28,634
CAMPAIGNS CAN BE. 

276
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,435
AND YOU'LL REMEMBER GEORGE BUSH 

277
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:32,071
WHO'S GOING TO BE HERE AT THE 

278
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,606
FUNERAL, YOU KNOW THAT GEORGE 

279
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,273
BUSH'S CAMPAIGN AMBUSHED HIM IN 

280
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:34,640
SOUTH CAROLINA. 

281
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:34,907
>> YES. 

282
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,544
>> SAID HE WAS THE FATHER OF A 

283
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,680
BLACK CHILD, SAID THAT HE WAS A 

284
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:40,947
TRAITOR. 

285
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,782
TRIED TO PULL OUT OF CONTEXT 

286
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,983
THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN NORTH 

287
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:49,789
VIETNAM, AND THAT WAS JUST LIKE 

288
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,457
KICKING JOHN MCCAIN IN THE 

289
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:51,724
STOMACH. 

290
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,259
IT'S ONE THING TO TAKE TORTURE 

291
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,561
FROM COMMUNISTS IN VIETNAM FAR 

292
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:59,131
FROM HOME WHO BELIEVE YOU'VE 

293
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,733
INVADED THEIR COUNTRY AND TO BE 

294
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,135
HURT AND HAVE YOUR BONES BROKEN 

295
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,870
AND BE TORTURED BY THEM, 

296
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,871
SOMETHING ELSE TO HAVE A FELLOW 

297
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,674
IN THE SAME POLITICAL PARTY 

298
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,043
KICK YOU IN THE STOMACH LIKE 

299
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:11,577
THAT. 

300
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:15,114
BUT, LOOK WHO'S SPEAKING AT HIS 

301
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,415
FUNERAL IS GEORGE W. BUSH. 

302
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,050
SO JOHN MCCAIN HAD THE ABILITY 

303
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,252
TO FORGIVE HIMSELF AFTER 

304
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,622
KEATING FIVE AND REBUILD A 

305
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,691
CAREER THAT PROVED THAT AS AN 

306
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,026
ABORRATION, AND HE HAD THE 

307
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:29,395
ABILITY TO FORGIVE PEOPLE WHO 

308
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,097
HURT HIM IN ORDER TO CONTINUE 

309
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,064
TO DO GOOD THINGS FOR AMERICA. 

310
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:35,468
>> YEAH, SO MUCH TO LEARN FROM 

311
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,368
THE WAY THE SENATOR LIVED HIS 

312
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:36,569
LIFE. 

313
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,337
DOUG WHEAT, I WANT TO THANK YOU 

314
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,405

THE MAN WHO REPRESENTED THIS 

339
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,150
STATE FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS. 

340
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,888

350
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,274

IS PERSONALLY MEANINGFUL TO

00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:52,777
JOHN MCCAIN HIMSELF. 

354
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:53,679
HE HAND SELECTED EVERYONE HE

369
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:18,637
WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD AN 

370
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,773
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM THE 

371
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,407
McCAIN CHILDREN YET. 

372
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,777
WE SAW THEM OF COURSE AT THAT 

373
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,378
VERY SOLEMN CEREMONY AT THE 

374
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,513
ARIZONA STATE CAPITOL 

375
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:27,813
YESTERDAY. 

376
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,215
CLEARLY THIS IS A FAMILY THAT 

377
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,016
IS GRIEVING, AND THAT'S WHY IT 

378
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,919
WAS SO SURPRISING TO SEE FOUR 

379
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,020
OF THE McCAIN CHILDREN COME 

380
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,323
BACK TO THE CAPITOL LATE LAST 

381
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,025
NIGHT AND THANK PEOPLE WHO HAD 

382
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,493
COME TO STAND IN LINE TO SEE 

383
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:44,797
McCAIN AS HE WAS LYING IN STATE 

384
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,232
IN THE ROTUNDA OF THE ARIZONA 

385
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:46,599
STATE CAPITOL. 

386
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,067
AND HE JUST SHOOK HANDS AND 

387
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,502
SAID HELLO TO PEOPLE WHO WERE 

388
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:52,605
VERY SURPRISED WHEN ONE OF 

389
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,205
McCAIN'S SON, SAID, OH, WELL, 

390
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,340
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, IT'S GREAT 

391
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,041
TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK OF HIM 

392
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,476
BECAUSE I'M HIS SON. 

393
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,646
AND, YOU KNOW, WAS SORT OF 

394
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,147
HEARTWARMING FOR EVERYONE, I 

395
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,349
THINK, A VOTE FOR THE 

396
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:03,949
CONSTITUENTS WHO WERE QUITE 

397
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,017
MOVED BY THE EXPERIENCE AND 

398
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,553
ALSO FOR THE MEMBERS OF HIS 

399
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,620
FAMILY WHO WERE SURELY 

400
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,655
COMFORTED BY THE FACT THAT 

401
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,023
THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE 

402
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:15,794
WHO LOVED HIM THE WAY THAT THEY 

403
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,629
DID. 

404
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,929
>> INDEED. 

405
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,132
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WILL 

406
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:20,799
BE SPEAKING. 

407
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,201
HE KNEW THE SENATOR VERY WELL. 

408
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:25,971
ANY HINT AS TO WHAT THE FORMER 

409
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,473
VICE PRESIDENT WILL BE SAYING 

410
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,039
IN HIS REMARKS? 

411
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:28,773
>>REPORTER:  YOU KNOW, IT'S 

412
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:30,375
ALWAYS HARD TO PREDICT EXACTLY 

413
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,112
WHAT JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO SAY, 

414
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,080
AND I THINK THAT THIS IS NO 

415
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,514
EXCEPTION. 

416
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,283
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THEIR 

417
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,018
RELATIONSHIP IS THAT THEY HAVE 

418
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,021
BEEN FRIENDS SINCE THEY WERE 

419
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,924
BOTH YOUNG MEN, SINCE BEFORE 

420
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,293
JOHN MCCAIN EVEN ENTERED THE 

421
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:47,526
SENATE. 

422
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:51,530
HE WAS THE NAVAL LIAISON TO THE 

423
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,967
SENATE, AND IN THAT CAPACITY HE 

424
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,869
HELPED, WORKED WITH A YOUNG 

425
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,338
SENATOR FROM DELAWARE NAMED JOE 

426
00:13:59,338 --> 00:13:59,571
BIDEN. 

427
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,407
AND THEY ACTUALLY TRAVELED THE 

428
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,241
WORLD TOGETHER ON MILITARY 

429
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,376
DELEGATIONS, AND THAT'S HOW 

430
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,377
THEY FIRST GOT TO KNOW ONE 

431
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:05,644
ANOTHER. 

432
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,579
AND THEN OF COURSE JOHN MCCAIN 

433
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:08,614
MARRIED HIS WIFE GINNED, MOVED 

434
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,783
TO HER HOME STATE -- CINDY, AND 

435
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,284
MOVED TO HER HOME STATE OF 

436
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,185
ARIZONA, EMEDDED UP RUNNING IN 

437
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,453
PRETTY SHORT ORDER FOR THE 

438
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,521
HOUSE AND A FEW YEARS LATER FOR 

439
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:17,990
THE SENATE WHERE HE THEN 

440
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,392
REJOINED HIS FRIEND JOE BIDEN 

441
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,960
AS A COLLEAGUE. 

442
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,661
AND THEY SPENT DECADES 

443
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,362
TOGETHER, AGAIN, TRAVELING, 

444
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,198
DUKING IT OUT ON THE SENATE 

445
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,499
FLOOR, PRAISING EACH OTHER ON 

446
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,300
THE SENATE FLOOR. 

447
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,804
THESE ARE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

448
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,072
NEVER HAD A PROBLEM MAKING 

449
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:33,839
FRIENDSHIPS THAT CROSSED PARTY 

450
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,072
LINES. 

451
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:36,408
AND SO I THINK THEY HAD A 

452
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,110
SIMILAR SENSE OF HUMOR, THEY 

453
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,013
WERE BOTH VERY GREGARIOUS, THEY 

454
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,414
BOTH LIKED TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. 

455
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,382
THEY BOTH LOVED TO TALK, AND 

456
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,284
I'M SURE THAT THEY HAD A LOT OF 

457
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,353
TIME TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ú 

458
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:51,223
SO I THINK WE'LL HEAR SOME VERY 

459
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,558
INTERESTING STORIES FROM JOE 

460
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,493
BIDEN TODAY ABOUT THEIR TIME 

461
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:54,827
TOGETHER. 

462
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,395
>> AND ALSO SOMEBODY ELSE 

463
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:56,928
SPEAKING TODAY, LARRY 

464
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:57,229
FITZGERALD. 

465
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,530
AND I THINK MANY PEOPLE MIGHT 

466
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,467
BE SURPRISED BECAUSE IT SEEMS 

467
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,001
LIKE AN UNLIKELY CHOICE. 

468
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:04,303
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT. 

469
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:04,936
>>REPORTER:  THAT'S RIGHT. 

470
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:06,238
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, JOHN MCCAIN, 

471
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,173
WHAT'S SO INTERESTING ABOUT HIM 

472
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,008
IS THAT HE HAD FRIENDS FROM 

473
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:11,476
ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM 

474
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:13,312
AND FRIENDS WHO HAD NOTHING 

475
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,946
WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH POLITICS. 

476
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:16,514
LARRY FITZGERALD, WIDE RECEIVER 

477
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:18,150
FOR THE ARIZONA CARDINALS FOR 

478
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,753
13 SEASONS, JOHN MCCAIN WAS A 

479
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,921
BIG SPORTS FAN HERE IN ARIZONA. 

480
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,290
HE WENT TO GAMES ALL THE TIME, 

481
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,626
AND SO HE ASKED LARRY MONTHS 

482
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:31,597
AGO IF HE WOULD SPEAK AT THIS 

483
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:31,864
SERVICE. 

484
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,234
ANOTHER INTERESTING APPEARANCE 

485
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:41,473
AT THE SERVICE TODAY IS A 

486
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,775
NAVAJO FLUTIST, HIS NAME IS 

487
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,275
JONAH LITTLE. 

488
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,476
HE ALWAYS SPOKE FOR THE NATIVE 

489
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,744
AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND WE SAW 

490
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,045
NATIVE AMERICANS COMING OUT IN 

491
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:48,213
FORCE AT THE STATE CAPITOL 

492
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,381
YESTERDAY TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS 

493
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,549
FOR THAT VERY REASON. 

494
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,884
HE WAS ON THE INDIAN AFFAIRS 

495
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,988
COMMITTEE, AND SO THIS WAS 

496
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,625
ANOTHER ONE OF HIS REQUESTS 

497
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,226
THAT NATIVE AMERICAN VIEWS AND 

498
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,927
PERFORMANCES BE INCORPORATED 

499
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:03,795
INTO HIS MEMORIAL SERVICES THIS 

500
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:04,196
WEEK. 

501
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,564
SO THAT SHOULD BE PRETTY 

502
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,365
MEANINGFUL AS WELL. 

503
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,199
>> THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING. 

504
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,300
YOU KNOW, JUST SORT OF BRIEFLY 

505
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,170
FOR A MOMENT, THE VIDEO FEED 

506
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,137
THAT HAS BEEN SET UP INSIDE THE 

507
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,273
CHURCH WAS RUNNING, AND I THINK 

508
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,375
WE MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FLUTIST 

509
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,378
PLAYING, AND THEN SHORTLY AFTER 

510
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,880
THAT, A GENTLEMAN WITH 

511
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,415
BAGPIPES, COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 

512
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:23,848
STYLE OF MUSIC. 

513
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:25,517
>>REPORTER:  HE LOVED HIS 

514
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:25,851
BAGPIPES. 

515
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,952
>> HE DID. 

516
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,655
>>REPORTER:  HE LOVED HIS 

517
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:29,922
BAGPIPES. 

518
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,689
JOHN MCCAIN LOVED BAGPIPES. 

519
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:33,125
HE LOVED STANDARDS. 

520
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:33,993
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR "MY WAY" 

521
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,427
FROM FRANK SINATRA AT THE END 

522
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,229
OF THE MEMORIAL SERVICE TODAY 

523
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,198
AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE A REPEAT 

524
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,366
PERFORMANCE OF THOSE BAGPIPES 

525
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,400
AT THE NATIONAL CATHEDRA ON 

526
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,000
SATURDAY. 

527
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,270
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HE MADE 

528
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,404
SURE WAS IN THIS PROGRAM. 

529
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:48,006
SO, YOU KNOW, FOR ANYONE WHO 

530
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,908
KNEW JOHN MCCAIN AND KNEW HIM 

531
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,644
WELL, THERE ARE GOING TO BE A 

532
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,779
LOT OF PERSONAL TOUCHES IN THIS 

533
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:54,046
CEREMONY. 

534
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,380
AND I THINK IN MANY WAYS IT'S 

535
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,983
GOING TO BE A LIGHTER CEREMONY 

536
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,618
THAN WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY, 

537
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,686
CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE TEARS 

538
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,488
AND THERE WILL BE TOUGH 

539
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:02,788
MOMENTS. 

540
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,521
BUT I SPOKE TO ONE OF HIS 

541
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:07,192
FRIENDS, GRANT WOODS WHO WAS 

542
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,630
THE FIRST CHIEF OF STAFF TO A 

543
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,396
VERY YOUNG CONGRESSMAN McGAIN 

544
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:14,066
BACK IN THE EARLY 1980s -- 

545
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,099
McCAIN BACK IN THE 1980s. 

546
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,568
HE WENT ON TO BE THE ARIZONA 

547
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,669
STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, HE'S A 

548
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,570
LAWYER HERE IN PHOENIX, HE'S 

549
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,171
GOING TO BE SPEAKING TODAY. 

550
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:21,807
AND HE HAS HAD A LOT OF TIME TO 

551
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,375
THINK ABOUT WHAT HE WAS GOING 

552
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,210
TO SAY BECAUSE HE TOO WAS ASKED 

553
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,377
BACK IN MARCH IF HE WOULD BE 

554
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:28,380
WILLING TO SPEAK WHEN THE TIME 

555
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:28,580
CAME. 

556
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,984
AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, THERE 

557
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,118
ARE SOME INAPPROPRIATE STORIES 

558
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,486
AND I'VE BEEN GOING BACK AND 

559
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,188
FORTH ABOUT WHETHER TO SHARE 

560
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,689
THEM AND I FINALLY FIGURED, 

561
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:38,623
HEY, THAT'S WHAT JOHN McCAIN 

562
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:39,024
WOULD WANT. 

563
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,593
HE WOULD WANT ME TO TELL THOSE 

564
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,060
STORIES. 

565
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,695
AND, SO, YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN 

566
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,931
TALKING A LOT ABOUT JOHN McCAIN 

567
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,534
THE MILITARY HERO THIS WEEK, 

568
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,167
JOHN McCAIN THE SENATOR. 

569
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,503
BUT THERE'S ALSO JOHN McCAIN 

570
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,905
THE JOKESTER AND THE STRAIGHT 

571
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,272
TALKER. 

572
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,306
YOU HEARD LINDSEY GRAHAM THE 

573
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:58,444
OTHER DAY SAY THAT IF HE WAS 

574
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,778
JOHN McCAIN'S WINGMAN, HIS CODE 

575
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,246
NAME WAS LITTLE JERK, THAT'S 

576
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:05,150
WHAT McCAIN LIKED TO CALL HIM. 

577
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,885
SO THIS WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS 

578
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,320
SAR CASTIC AND HAD A GREAT 

579
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,622
SENSE OF HUMOR AND LOVED TO PUT 

580
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,422
OTHERS DOWN, PUT HIMSELF DOWN 

581
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:13,959
IN GEST, AND I THINK YOU'RE 

582
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,994
GOING TO GET A FLAVOR OF THAT 

583
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:16,728
TODAY AT THIS MEMORIAL SERVICE. 

584
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,931
>> AND, NANCY, I BELIEVE YOU 

585
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,698
SPOKE TO ONE OF HIS OTHER 

586
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,868
FRIENDS, YOU CAN CORRECTME IF 

587
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:23,635
I'M WRONG, TOMMY ESPINOZA, DID 

588
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,636
YOU SPEAK TO HIM AS WELL? 

589
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,473
>>REPORTER:  I DID SPEAK TO HIM 

590
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:27,806
AS WELL. 

591
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,807
ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS 

592
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,577
FORGED DECADES AGO, ANOTHER 

593
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,012
UNLIKELY FRIENDSHIP SOME WOULD 

594
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:34,212
SAY. 

595
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,048
HERE YOU HAD A YOUNG REPUBLICAN 

596
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,282
CONGRESSMAN AND A YOUNG LATINO 

597
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,685
ACTIVIST FROM A TIME BACK IN 

598
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,887
THE 1980s WHEN THE LATINO 

599
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:45,390
POPULATION WAS NOT AS LARGE AND 

600
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,159
INFLUENTIAL IN ARIZONA AS IT IS 

601
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:47,392
TODAY. 

602
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,161
SO AS ESPINOZA PUT IT IN OUR 

603
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,529
CONVERSATION, THERE REALLY 

604
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,431
WASN'T A HUGE UPSIDE FOR McCAIN 

605
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,800
BACK THEN TO BEFRIEND AN 

606
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,135
ACTIVIST IN THE LATINO 

607
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:57,435
COMMUNITY. 

608
00:18:57,435 --> 00:18:58,937
BUT THEY JUST HAD A SIMILAR 

609
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,872
SENSIBILITY, THEY HAD SIMILAR 

610
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:03,775
INTERESTS IN MAKING SURE THAT 

611
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:04,910
THE LATINO COMMUNITY WAS WELL 

612
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,113
SERVED, AND SO THEY HIT IT OFF 

613
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,148
IN THE EARLY '80s, AND THEY DID 

614
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:13,017
COUNTLESS TOWN HALLS TOGETHER, 

615
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:13,852
THEY TRAVELED THE STATE 

616
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:14,119
TOGETHER. 

617
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,621
ESPINOZA TOLD ME THAT ONE OF 

618
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,789
THE REASONS THEY BECAME FRIENDS 

619
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,525
SO QUICKLY WAS THAT McCAIN 

620
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,629
ASKED HIM IF HE'D LIKE TO HAVE 

621
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,796
DINNER AND ESPINOZA SAID SURE, 

622
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:24,996
SURE. 

623
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,598
I'VE HEARD MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 

624
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,267
SAY BEFORE THEY LIKE TO GET 

625
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,434
TOGETHER, IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY 

626
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:29,667
HAPPEN. 

627
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:33,171
BUT IN THIS CASE THEY ACTUALLY 

628
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:33,605
SET A DATE. 

629
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,973
AND ESPINOZA SAID, OKAY, WHY 

630
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,843
DON'T YOU COME TO MY HOUSE FOR 

631
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,646
DINNER AND I'LL GRILL SOME 

632
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:40,879
STEAKS. 

633
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:41,914
RIGHT BEFORE HE SHOWED UP, 

634
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,015
ESPINOZA FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS 

635
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:44,349
HIS BIRTHDAY. 

636
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,183
AND McCAIN WAS KEEPING HIS 

637
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:48,053
PROMISE EVEN THOUGH HE WAS 

638
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,689
LEAVING A FAMILY CELEBRATION TO 

639
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,423
DO SO. 

640
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,291
SO ESPINOZA VERY QUICKLY RANG 

641
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,393
UP A MARIACHI BAND AND GOT THEM 

642
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:58,396
TO COME OVER TO HIS HOUSE SO 

643
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,565
THEY COULD SERENADE JOHN MCCAIN 

644
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,266
AND CINDY McCAIN AS THEY WALKED 

645
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,134
THROUGH THE DOOR AND SANG. 

646
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,869
AND McCAIN GOT SUCH A KICK OUT 

647
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,005
OF THAT AND HAD SUCH A GREAT 

648
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,273
TIME THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY 

649
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,374
CLEARLY -- THEY HIT IT OFF, 

650
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,709
THEY HAD THE SAME SENSE OF 

651
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,244
HUMOR AND THEY WERE VERY GOOD 

652
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,245
FRIENDS RIGHT UP UNTIL HIS 

653
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:13,478
DEATH. 

654
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,679
>> THAT'S A GREAT STORY. 

655
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,550
I SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A MUSICAL 

656
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,117
THEME. 

657
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,084
WE TALKED ABOUT THE NATIVE 

658
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:20,852
AMERICAN PERFORMER, THE 

659
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,622
BAGPIPES, THIS STORY, AND I WAS 

660
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,589
JUST TALKING TO DOUG WHEAT, HIS 

661
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:26,625
STORIAN, AND THE STORY THAT HE 

662
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,028
TOLD ME ABOUT McCAIN WAS HIM 

663
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,364
DANCING TO SORT OF MILITARY 

664
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,498
STANDARDS AND BEING CAUGHT UP 

665
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,801
IN A MILITARY BAND, AND IT 

666
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,636
REMINDED ME OF HOW MUCH THE 

667
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,136
MILITARY MEANT TO HIM. 

668
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:41,106
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TALK A 

669
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,307
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT? 

670
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,309
>>REPORTER:  OH, ABSOLUTELY. 

671
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,679
I MEAN, LOOK, HE COMES FROM A 

672
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,181
LONG LINE OF NAVY ADMIRALS, AS 

673
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:50,448
YOU KNOW. 

674
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:52,984
IT WAS SORT OF PREORDAINED THAT 

675
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:55,287
HE WAS GOING TO GO TO THE NAVAL 

676
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:55,786
ACADEMY HIMSELF. 

677
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:56,588
HE SEEMED TO STRUGGLE WITH THAT 

678
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,489
PERSONALLY AT FIRST, IT MIGHT 

679
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,624
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE 

680
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:01,159
FACT THAT HE FINISHED, AS HE 

681
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,094
LOVED TO TELL EVERYONE, FIFTH 

682
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,297
FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS CLASS AT 

683
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,499
THE NAVAL ACADEMY, WORE THE 

684
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,134
BADGE OF HONOR FOR THE REST OF 

685
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,502
HIS LIFE, PROBABLY THOUGHT HE 

686
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,536
WAS THE BLACK SHEEP OF THE 

687
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,471
FAMILY, WASN'T GOING TO AMOUNT 

688
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,607
TO MUCH AT THAT POINT IN HIS 

689
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:21,113
LIFE, AND CERTAINLY HE PROVED 

690
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,547
HIMSELF WRONG ABOUT THAT. LY -

691
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,016
YOU KNOW, EVEN AFTER HE WAS 

692
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:27,953
RELEASED FROM IMPRISONMENT IN 

693
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,021
VIETNAM AND CAME BACK TO THE 

694
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:31,923
UNITED STATES, HE MAINTAINED A 

695
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,225
COMMITMENT TO THE MILITARY THAT 

696
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,459
LASTED HIS ENTIRE LIFE. 

697
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,961
HE WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 

698
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,095
ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE IN THE 

699
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,498
SENATE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS 

700
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,967
OF HIS LIFE. 

701
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,669
HE SERVED ON THE ARMED SERVICES 

702
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:45,269
COMMITTEE FOR DECADES. 

703
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:45,937
THE LAST DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION 

704
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,673
ACT WHICH WAS SIGNED JUST A 

705
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:51,610
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WAS NAMED 

706
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,110
AFTER HIM. 

707
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,579
HE IS SOMEONE WHO FOUGHT TO 

708
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,982
MAKE SURE THAT THE MILITARY HAD 

709
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,850
THE RESOURCES THAT IT NEEDED, 

710
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,818
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME FIGHTING 

711
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,420
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WASN'T 

712
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,691
WASTING MONEY ON THINGS THAT IT 

713
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:07,024
DIDN'T NEED. 

714
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:09,861
HE'S SOMEONE WHO TRAVELED THE 

715
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,330
GLOBE NOT TO FANCY ANY EXCITING 

716
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,400
PLACES, BUT TO HOT SPOTS AND 

717
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,735
WAR ZONES AND AREAS WHERE 

718
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,204
PEOPLE WERE SUFFERING BECAUSE 

719
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:24,009
HE KNEW THAT HE WAS SOMEONE WHO 

720
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,410
WAS RECOGNIZABLE AROUND THE 

721
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,680
WORLD AS A SYMBOL OF FREEDOM, 

722
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,748
AS A SYMBOL OF AMERICAN 

723
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,048
DEMOCRACY. 

724
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,816
AND EVEN IF THERE WASN'T 

725
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:32,984
SOMETHING THAT HE PERSONALLY 

726
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,021
COULD DO TO IMPROVE THE 

727
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,889
SITUATION, HE KNEW THAT GOING 

728
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,291
TO THESE PLACES GAVE PEOPLE 

729
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,060
HOPE AND GAVE THEM A SENSE THAT 

730
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,962
THE UNITED STATES HAD NOT 

731
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:44,496
FORGOTTEN ABOUT THEM. 

732
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:44,763

915
00:49:28,264 --> 00:49:29,800
AND ABOUT ONE MINUTE LATER WE 

916
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:35,505
WENT RIGHT BACK BY BECAUSE HE'D 

917
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,774
GONE THE WRONG WAY OF COURSE, 

918
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:38,708
WAVED AGAIN. 

919
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:42,446
AND I JUST SAY THAT TWO HOURS 

920
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:43,814
KIND OF EPITOMIZED THE NEXT 35 

921
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,182
YEARS OF ME WITH JOHN MCCAIN. 

922
00:49:46,182 --> 00:49:47,183
IT WAS ONCE A LITTLE BIT 

923
00:49:47,183 --> 00:49:48,685
HARROWING, A LITTLE BIT WILD, A 

924
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:52,322
LITTLE BIT CRAZY BUT A LOT OF 

925
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,390
FUN AND THE GREATEST HONOR OF 

926
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:53,657
MY LIFE. 

927
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,825
I HAVE PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE 

928
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,827
TIME DID YOU EVER KNOW IN THOSE 

929
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,629
EARLY YEARS, DID YOU HAVE A 

930
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,765
FEELING YOU HAD SOMEONE SO 

931
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:02,132
SPECIAL THERE. 

932
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,768
AND MY ANSWER IS, YES, 

933
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:05,068
ABSOLUTELY. 

934
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:06,102
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. 

935
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:07,336
AND I'LL TELL YOU THE FIRST 

936
00:50:07,336 --> 00:50:10,307
TIME, IT WAS A DECEMBER, AND IT 

937
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:13,209
WAS OVER IN MY HOMETOWN OF 

938
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:13,576
MESA, ARIZONA. 

939
00:50:13,576 --> 00:50:15,579
WE'RE AT A ROTARY CLUB, AND I 

940
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,647
THINK IT WAS ALL MEN AT THAT 

941
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:17,847
TIME. 

942
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:19,583
AND, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE TOUGH 

943
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,251
GUYS AND KIND OF CYNICAL ABOUT 

944
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,720
THINGS, AND HERE'S THIS NEW GUY 

945
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:23,987
IN TOWN. 

946
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:26,590
AND ONE OF THEM ASKED HIM SINCE 

947
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,992
IT WAS DECEMBER, HE ASKED HIM 

948
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,393
WHAT ABOUT CHRISTMAS IN PRISON? 

949
00:50:30,393 --> 00:50:34,397
AND HE TOLD THEM A COUPLE OF 

950
00:50:34,397 --> 00:50:34,664
STORIES. 

951
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,032
HE TOLD THEM ABOUT ONE NIGHT 

952
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,435
WHEN HE WAS BEING INTERROGATED 

953
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:41,605
FOR QUITE A LONG TIME AND IT 

954
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,874
DIDN'T GO TOO WELL FOR HIS 

955
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:44,141
CAPTORS. 

956
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:45,074
THEY WERE UPSET WITH HIM. 

957
00:50:45,074 --> 00:50:46,742
AND SO THEY TIED HIM UP AND 

958
00:50:46,742 --> 00:50:48,144
THEY TIED THE ROPES TIGHT, AND 

959
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:52,849
IT WAS VERY PAINFUL AND THEY 

960
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:53,683
LEFT HIM THERE FOR THE NIGHT. 

961
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:57,187
AND SOME GUARD CAME IN WHO HE 

962
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,522
DID NOT KNOW AND NEVER HAD 

963
00:50:58,522 --> 00:50:59,355
SPOKEN TO. 

964
00:50:59,355 --> 00:51:02,425
AND AT 10:00 P.M. 

965
00:51:02,425 --> 00:51:04,528
THE GUARD WALKED IN AND UNLOOSE 

966
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:05,695
HEENED THE ROPE -- UNLOOSENED 

967
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:05,995
THE ROPES. 

968
00:51:05,995 --> 00:51:07,898
AND AT ABOUT 4:00 A.M. 

969
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,899
THE GUARD COME BACK AND 

970
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,567
TIGHTENED THEM UP AGAIN SO THAT 

971
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,867
HE WOULDN'T GET IN TROUBLE. 

972
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:13,170
AND JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHY THAT 

973
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,572
HAPPENED, BUT HE FOUND OUT A 

974
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,740
LITTLE CLUE A COUPLE WEEKS 

975
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,542
LATER RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS 

976
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:19,809
WHEN HE WAS STANDING IN THE 

977
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:21,411
DIRT YARD AND THAT GUARD JUST 

978
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,479
WALKED UP NEXT TO HIM. 

979
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:31,188
AND THE GUARD DIDN'T SAY A 

980
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,990
WORD, BUT WITH HIS SANDAL HE 

981
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,327
DREW A CROSS IN THE DIRT, AND 

982
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:39,896
THEY LOOKED AT IT FOR A MINUTE, 

983
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,866
AND THEN THE GUARD RUBBED IT 

984
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,401
OUT AND WENT ON HIS WAY. 

985
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:47,937
AND IT WAS QUIET IN THAT ROOM 

986
00:51:47,937 --> 00:51:50,540
WHEN JOHN TOLD THAT. 

987
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,411
AND THEN HE SAID, YOU KNOW, ON 

988
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:57,981
CHRISTMAS EVE WE CELEBRATED, 

989
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:00,383
AND WE GOT TOGETHER UNDER THIS 

990
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:04,387
BARE LIGHT BULB AND WE SANG 

991
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:05,822
CHRISTMAS CAROLS, AND WE QUOTED 

992
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,624
BIBLE VERSES THAT WE COULD 

993
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,859
REMEMBER, AND WE TOLD THE 

994
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:12,295
GOSPEL STORY TO EACH OTHER. 

995
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:19,135
AND I GUESS JUST THAT IMAGE OF 

996
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:23,507
THIS BAND OF BROTHERS TOGETHER 

997
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,376
IN THIS GOD-FORSAKEN PLACE 

998
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:31,014
SINGING TO EACH OTHER, AND 

999
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:34,384
THERE AT THE FRONT OUR GUY, 

1000
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:40,390
JOHN McCAIN BEATEN UP BUT NOT 

1001
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,625
DOWN SINGING HIS FAVORITE 

1002
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,526
CHRISTMAS CAROL "SILENT NIGHT" 

1003
00:52:43,526 --> 00:52:47,564
HOLY NIGHT, ALL IS CALM, ALL IS 

1004
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:47,797
BRIGHT. 

1005
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:50,667
ROUND YON VIRGIN, MOTHER AND 

1006
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,002
CHILD, HOLY INFANT, SO TENDER 

1007
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:52,535
AND MILD. 

1008
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:53,470
THE WORDS SEEMED SO FAR AWAY 

1009
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,572
FROM THAT PLACE, BUT THEY LEAN 

1010
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,807
ON THE FAITH OF THEIR -- LEANED 

1011
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,276
ON THE FAITH OF THEIR FATHERS 

1012
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,478
AND THEIR FAITH IN EACH OTHER, 

1013
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,146
AND THEIR FAITH IN THEIR 

1014
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:04,547
COUNTRY AND THEIR FAITH IN GOD. 

1015
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:06,516
I LOOKED OUT INTO THAT AUDIENCE 

1016
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,118
THERE IN MY HOMETOWN, AND THOSE 

1017
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:13,957
WERE SOME OF MY PEERS AND THE 

1018
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,492
PEERS OF MY PARENTS. 

1019
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:19,562
THOSE ARE TOUGH INDEPENDENT 

1020
00:53:19,562 --> 00:53:19,762
GUYS. 

1021
00:53:19,762 --> 00:53:21,664
THEY ARE RANCHERS AND FARMERS. 

1022
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:24,901
THERE'S SOME COWBOYS, 

1023
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,002
BUSINESSMEN, ENTREPRENEURS, AND 

1024
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,036
THEY WERE CRYING BECAUSE THEY 

1025
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:29,506
SAW IN JOHN McCAIN A LITTLE BIT 

1026
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:33,743
OF WHAT THEY HOPED TO SEE IN 

1027
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,612
THEMSELVES. 

1028
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,614
THEY SAW IN JOHN McCAIN THE 

1029
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:41,818
EMBODIMENT OF VALUES THAT THEY 

1030
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,854
HOPED TO SEE FOR THEIR COUNTRY. 

1031
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:46,956
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND 

1032
00:53:46,956 --> 00:53:49,292
YEARS JOHN GOT TO KNOW THIS 

1033
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:54,931
PLACE, AND HE FELL IN LOVE WITH 

1034
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:55,532
ARIZONA. 

1035
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,601
HE LOVED THE PEOPLE, OUR 

1036
00:53:58,601 --> 00:54:01,638
DIVERSITY, OUR NATIVE AMERICAN 

1037
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:04,274
COMMUNITY, OUR HISPANIC CULTURE 

1038
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,142
AND HE LOVED THE PLACE, IN 

1039
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:07,978
PARTICULAR THE GRAND CANYON, 

1040
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:08,411
THE COLORADO RIVER. 

1041
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,212
WE FLOATED DOWN THAT TWICE 

1042
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:11,581
TOGETHER, AND THEN HE KEPT 

1043
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,284
GOING BACK AND BACK. 

1044
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:14,717
HE LOVED IT. 

1045
00:54:14,717 --> 00:54:18,021
HE HIKED THE CANYON WITH JACK 

1046
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:21,391
NOT THAT LONG AGO, RIM TO RIM. 

1047
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:22,058
HE LOVED SEDONA. 

1048
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:22,725
HE LOVED THIS PLACE. 

1049
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:24,861
AND IF JOHN McCAIN FELL IN LOVE 

1050
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:30,166
WITH ARIZONA, ARIZONA FELL IN 

1051
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,267
LOVE WITH JOHN MCCAIN JOHN Mc. 

1052
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:35,338
WE RAN A LOT OF RACES HERE, A 

1053
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,340
LOT OF ELECTIONS. 

1054
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,909
HE NEVER LOST, NEVER REALLY 

1055
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,044
VERY CLOSE. 

1056
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:42,478
ARIZONA LOVED HIM. 

1057
00:54:42,478 --> 00:54:45,582
WE HAD ONE LITTLE BLIP ONE TIME 

1058
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,584
WHEN HE RAN FOR THE SENATE THE 

1059
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:47,884
FIRST TIME. 

1060
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:48,885
HE CALLED ME ON THE PHONE. 

1061
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,721
HE GOES, WELL, BOY, I THINK I 

1062
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:52,388

1063
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:52,722
I GO WHY? 

1064
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:55,091

HE SAYS, WELL, IT'S BECAUSE YOU 

1072
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,242

00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,515
WAS ABOUT A 90-YEAR-OLD GUY IN 

1095
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:57,087
A GOLF CART RIGHT THERE, AND HE 

1096
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:57,920
WAS GIVING US THE FINGER. 

1097
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,121
[ LAUGHTER  ] 

1098
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:01,925
>> AND LITTLE DID HE KNOW WE 

1099
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:02,959
BOTH SAID THAT'S GREAT. 

1100
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:03,326
WE LOVED THAT. 

1101
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,995
AND JOHN WAS, LIKE, HEY, GOOD 

1102
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:06,328
TO SEE YOU. 

1103
00:56:06,328 --> 00:56:08,264
GOOD TO SEE YOU, PAL. 

1104
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:09,132
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. 

1105
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:11,034
SO HE WENT IN. 

1106
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,770
HE SAID, OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT, 

1107
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,271
AND WENT TO WORK. 

1108
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,272
AND GUESS WHAT. 

1109
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:20,877
I THINK HE WON THAT ABOUT 85/15 

1110
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,579
IN THAT ELECTION IN THAT 

1111
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:23,446
PRECINCT. 

1112
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:26,549
SO WE'RE GOING TO MISS SO MANY 

1113
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,885
THINGS ABOUT HIM HERE IN OUR 

1114
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,119
STATE, HIS LEADERSHIP HERE ON 

1115
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:30,754
THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. 

1116
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,722
WE'RE GOING TO MISS HIS SENSE 

1117
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,155
OF HUMOR. 

1118
00:56:33,155 --> 00:56:37,794
WE'RE GOING TO MISS HIS LOVE OF 

1119
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:38,294
SPORTS. 

1120
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:40,430
HE LOVED THE TEAMS, ALL OF OUR 

1121
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:40,930
TEAMS. 

1122
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,332
I MEAN BY LOVE THEM, I MEAN 

1123
00:56:43,332 --> 00:56:47,237
LOVE THEM, LIKE NONSTOP, OKAY? 

1124
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,305
AND HE LOVED YOU GUYS, GONZO 

1125
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:50,406
AND SHANE, HE REALLY DID. 

1126
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:50,973
NOT A COINCIDENCE. 

1127
00:56:50,973 --> 00:56:52,575
HE DIDN'T BECOME FRIENDS JUST 

1128
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:59,315
WITH THE BEST PLAYERS, BUT WITH 

1129
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:00,850
THE BEST PEOPLE. 

1130
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:01,684
AND HE LOVED YOU GUYS. 

1131
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,020
BUT I THINK WE ALSO WORRIED 

1132
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,323
HERE IN ARIZONA ABOUT A BIGGER 

1133
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:07,623
PICTURE. 

1134
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:11,427
AND I HOPE THAT WHAT HE STOOD 

1135
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,763
FOR WILL MAYBE GET RENEWED LOOK 

1136
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,530
IN OUR COUNTRY. 

1137
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:15,498
THAT'S WHAT HE WOULD WANT. 

1138
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:18,101
HE WOULD WANT US TO -- OKAY, WE 

1139
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,401
RECOGNIZE HIM NOW, BUT NOW 

1140
00:57:19,401 --> 00:57:20,036
LET'S GET TO WORK. 

1141
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:21,604
AND I'M SURE THE VICE PRESIDENT 

1142
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,607
WILL TALK ABOUT JOHN AND 

1143
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,274
BIPARTISANSHIP, BUT HE BELIEVED 

1144
00:57:25,274 --> 00:57:27,710
SO MUCH THAT THIS IN THE END, 

1145
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,845
WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE, 

1146
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,280
THIS REPUBLICAN/DEMOCRAT THING 

1147
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,814
IS NOT THAT IMPORTANT, IS IT? 

1148
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:32,882
WE'RE ALL AMERICAN, AND YOU 

1149
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:37,720
GOTTA GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE 

1150
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,454
CAN WORK TOGETHE AS AMERICANS. 

1151
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:40,223
HIS SUPPORT OF THE MILITARY, I 

1152
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,292
HOPE YOU MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 

1153
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,493
WILL KEEP THAT STRONG. 

1154
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:48,398
IT WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE HAD 

1155
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:48,731
THEIR BACKS. 

1156
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:49,966
AND ONE OTHER THING, JOHN 

1157
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:50,800
MCCAIN BELIEVED IN OUR 

1158
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,934
CONSTITUTION, AND HE STOOD UP 

1159
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:52,168
FOR IT. 

1160
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:54,504
HE FOUGHT FOR IT EVERY STEP OF 

1161
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:54,770
THE WAY. 

1162
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,540
SO HE WOULD NOT STAND BY AS 

1163
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,310
PEOPLE TRIED TO TRAMPLE THE 

1164
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,946
CONSTITUTION OR THE BILL OF 

1165
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:03,513
RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE FIRST 

1166
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:03,813
AMENDMENT. 

1167
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,782
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1168
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,484
HE BELIEVED IN THE DECLARATION 

1169
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,384
OF INDEPENDENCE. 

1170
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:10,820
WHEN WE PROCLAIM TO THE WORLD 

1171
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,722
THAT EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING 

1172
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,457
IS IMPORTANT, EVERY SINGLE 

1173
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:15,491
HUMAN BEING IS PRECIOUS, EVERY 

1174
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:19,095
SINGLE PERSON IN THIS WORLD HAS 

1175
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:21,898
THE RIGHT TO LIVE FREE, NOT 

1176
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:24,267
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS SO, 

1177
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:26,369
BUT BECAUSE GOD GAVE US THAT 

1178
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:26,636
RIGHT. 

1179
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:28,972
SO JOHN MCCAIN HIS ENTIRE LIFE 

1180
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:32,308
STOOD BY THE FREEDOM FIGHTERS 

1181
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:33,509
ACROSS THE WORLD. 

1182
00:58:33,509 --> 00:58:33,943
HE WAS THERE. 

1183
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:37,279
HE WAS THERE FIGURATIVELY AND 

1184
00:58:37,279 --> 00:58:39,482
LITERALLY BY THEIR SIDE, 

1185
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:44,687
WHEREVER THEY WERE, 

1186
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,688
ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR RIGHT TO 

1187
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,589
LIVE FREE. 

1188
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:49,659
IT'S A LONG AND WINDING ROAD 

1189
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:52,562
THAT TOOK HIM FROM THAT DIRT 

1190
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:57,700
YARD IN HANOI TO THE DIRT BACK 

1191
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,502
ROADS OF HIDDEN VALLEY. 

1192
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,839
BUT THROUGH IT ALL HE WAS RES 

1193
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:03,339
LEUTZ. 

1194
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:04,507
HE WAS COURAGEOUS -- HE WAS 

1195
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:05,108
RESOLUTE. 

1196
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,343
HE WAS COURAGEOUS EVERY STEP OF 

1197
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:07,609
THE WAY. 

1198
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:11,581
AND IN ARIZONA HE WAS OUR HERO. 

1199
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:18,121
I THINK YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS 

1200
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:21,991
OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT AND LOVE 

1201
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:29,365
FOR JOHN MCCAIN THAT HE WAS 

1202
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:29,732
AMERICA'S HERO. 

1203
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:32,101
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN FROM 

1204
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:39,008
ARIZONA, HE SERVED HIS COUNTRY 

1205
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:39,308
WITH HONOR. 

1206
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:49,551
HE FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT. 

1207
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:51,954
HE FINISHED THE RACE. 

1208
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:59,162
HE KEPT THE FAITH. 

1209
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:05,134
NOW, MY FRIEND, WE CAN FINISH 

1210
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:06,102
THE SONG. 

1211
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:06,635
SLEEP IN HEAVENLY PEACE. 

1212
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:11,507
SLEEP IN HEAVENLY PEACE. 

1213
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:11,707
AMEN. 

1214
01:00:11,707 --> 01:00:27,490
[ APPLAUSE  ] 

1215
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:34,797
>> WELL, I HAD THE GREAT 

1216
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,966
OPPORTUNITY OF MEETING 

1217
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,434
CONGRESSMAN JOHN McCAIN IN 

1218
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,002
WASHINGTON, SEE HOW IT WAS BACK 

1219
01:00:40,002 --> 01:00:44,741
THERE VISITING, AND HE SAID YOU 

1220
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:47,510
NEED TO MEET THIS CONGRESSMAN, 

1221
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,413
THIS YOUNG MAVERICK, FULL OF 

1222
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:50,646
ENERGY. 

1223
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:52,014
AND I SAID, OH, YEAH? 

1224
01:00:52,014 --> 01:00:52,581
HE SAID, BESIDES THAT, HE'S 

1225
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:53,349
GOING TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF 

1226
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:54,984
THE UNITED STATES ONE DAY AND 

1227
01:00:54,984 --> 01:01:00,289
HE SAYS YOU NEED TO MEET HIM. 

1228
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,424
I SAID OKAY. 

1229
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:09,398
SO WE MET IN VIRGINIA AT -- MY 

1230
01:01:09,398 --> 01:01:09,698
APOLOGIES. 

1231
01:01:09,698 --> 01:01:10,967
IT WAS ROUGH GETTING UP HERE. 

1232
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:11,601
ALEXANDRIA. 

1233
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:14,070
CINDY AND CEEAI AND MYSELF, WE 

1234
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,071
HAD DINNER IN THIS NICE LITTLE 

1235
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:17,140
RESTAURANT, AND WE CHATTED FOR 

1236
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,909
A WHILE, AND THEN ALL OF A 

1237
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:21,210
SUDDEN WITH JOHN MCCAIN, HE 

1238
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:21,510
JUST BOND. 

1239
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:22,979
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIS 

1240
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:25,682
ENERGY LEVEL THAT GOES UP, HE 

1241
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,650
STARTS TALKING, STARTS ASKING 

1242
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,784
ME ABOUT MY BACKGROUND. 

1243
01:01:28,784 --> 01:01:30,119
OF COURSE NOT KNOWING HIM THAT 

1244
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,286
WELL, ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS. 

1245
01:01:31,286 --> 01:01:33,322
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT, WE FELT 

1246
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:34,757
VERY COMFORTABLE WITH EACH 

1247
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:36,259
OTHER GOING BACK AND FORTH. 

1248
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:39,862
SO THEN I GOT ENOUGH NERVE TO 

1249
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:44,967
ASK HIM, I SAID, CONGRESSMAN, 

1250
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,103
WHAT WAS IT THAT ALLOWED YOU TO 

1251
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:51,808
BE IN A PRISONER OF WAR CAMP, I 

1252
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:53,075
MEAN, WHAT KEPT YOU TOGETHER? 

1253
01:01:53,075 --> 01:01:54,911
AND HE SAID, WELL, HE GOES, YOU 

1254
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:58,581
KNOW, MOST PEOPLE ASKED ME HOW 

1255
01:01:58,581 --> 01:01:59,849
THEY TREATED ME, OBVIOUSLY THEY 

1256
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:00,750
TREATED ME PRETTY BAD. 

1257
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:05,154
HE GOES, BUT -- HE SAID ONE IS 

1258
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:08,991
MY FAITH IN GOD, MY LOVE FOR MY 

1259
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:15,598
FAMILY, AND MY FAITH IN MY 

1260
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:15,865
COUNTRY. 

1261
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:17,300
HE SAID THOSE THINGS KEPT ME 

1262
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:17,767
TOGETHER. 

1263
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:22,772
SO WE KEPT TALKING THAT 

1264
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:23,039
EVENING. 

1265
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,209
AND AS I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT 

1266
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:30,079
DISCUSSION AND FOR THIS TALK, I 

1267
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,550
WANTED TO REFLECT WITH YOU A 

1268
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:40,756
READING FROM CORINTHIANS 13 

1269
01:02:40,756 --> 01:02:41,557
WHICH I THINK CAPTURES SENATOR 

1270
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:41,891
JOHN McCAIN. 

1271
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,526
CORINTHIANS 13, THOUGH I SHOULD 

1272
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:47,129

1296
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,239

1320
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,383

01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:32,600
SO JOHN KIND OF PUT ME OUT ON 

1451
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,836
THE NATIONAL SCENE, AND I MUST 

1452
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,272
CONFESS HE DID A NUMBER OF 

1453
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,841
THINGS THAT I COULD STAND HERE 

1454
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,743
ALL DAY AND SHARE WITH YOU 

1455
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:41,377
DIFFERENT STORIES. 

1456
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:43,479
I WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT ONE 

1457
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,613
TIME WHEN WE MET IS WHEN MEGHAN 

1458
01:09:45,613 --> 01:09:47,683
WAS ON THE TV PROGRAM, AND I 

1459
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,818
DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE NAME OF 

1460
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:51,252
THE TV PROGRAM, MEGHAN, BUT HE 

1461
01:09:51,252 --> 01:09:53,488
SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW MEGHAN IS 

1462
01:09:53,488 --> 01:09:57,793
ON TV NOW AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. 

1463
01:09:57,793 --> 01:09:58,494
I GO OKAY. 

1464
01:09:58,494 --> 01:09:58,994
DO YOU SEE HER? 

1465
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:01,563
NO, SENATOR, I DON'T WATCH TV 

1466
01:10:01,563 --> 01:10:02,464
THAT MUCH. 

1467
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:05,134
WELL, YOU START WATCHING HER. 

1468
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,168
[ LAUGHTER  ] 

1469
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:06,635
>> OKAY. 

1470
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:08,870
SO THAT WAS OUR GREAT SENATOR. 

1471
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:13,509
AS WE WERE WALK OUT, HE ASKED 

1472
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:15,477
MY WIFE, HE SAYS, VEDA, I GOT A 

1473
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:17,479
QUESTION FOR YOU, IF I PUT A 

1474
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,948
WOMAN ON OUR TICKET AS VICE 

1475
01:10:19,948 --> 01:10:20,849
PRESIDENT, WHAT DO YOU THINK 

1476
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:22,818
ABOUT THAT? 

1477
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:26,155
WELL, MY WIFE ISN'T THE TYPE 

1478
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:26,855
THAT HOLDS BACK. 

1479
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:27,689
SHE'S A MEXICAN FROM MEXICO 

1480
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:30,425
CITY, AND THEY HAVE A TENDENCY 

1481
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:32,728
OF JUST TELLING YOU HOW IT IS 

1482
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,530
AND OF COURSE THE SENATOR LIKED 

1483
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:34,763
THAT. 

1484
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:35,698
SO SHE TURNS, AND SHE SAYS, 

1485
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:37,266
WELL, I REALLY DON'T CARE IF 

1486
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:38,333
IT'S A MAN OR A WOMAN. 

1487
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:39,601
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU, I 

1488
01:10:39,601 --> 01:10:41,837
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PERSON 

1489
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:42,304
CAN RUN THE COUNTRY. 

1490
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:44,840
SO JOHN LOOKED AT HER AND SAYS 

1491
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,040
OKAY. 

1492
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,744
HE LOOKED AT HER, IT'S TWO 

1493
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,080
GUYS, AND OF COURSE WE WALKED 

1494
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:51,313
OUT. 

1495
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:54,116
NEEDLESS TO SAY LATER WE HEARD 

1496
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:55,416
WHO HE HAD ELECTED. 

1497
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:57,486
REGARDLESS, THERE WAS THE 

1498
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:58,786
SENATOR AGAIN TAKING THE RISK 

1499
01:10:58,786 --> 01:11:05,427
OF PUTTING FORTH A WOMAN FOR 

1500
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,762
VICE PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT 

1501
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:07,162
COUNTRY OF OURS. 

1502
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:08,129
SO IT'S OF NO SURPRISE. 

1503
01:11:08,129 --> 01:11:11,467
IT'S OF NO SURPRISE ALSO THAT 

1504
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:15,104
HE GOT TOGETHER WITH KENNEDY TO 

1505
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:15,704
PUSH FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM 

1506
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:16,338
BECAUSE WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 

1507
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:17,205
IMMIGRATION, IT WASN'T SO MUCH 

1508
01:11:17,205 --> 01:11:18,840
THE POLITIC OF IT. 

1509
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,109
HE WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1510
01:11:21,109 --> 01:11:23,479
I CAN'T BELIEVE THESE FAMILIES 

1511
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:27,049
THAT COME FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY, 

1512
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:30,085
FROM MEXICO, FROM CENTRAL 

1513
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:32,688
AMERICA TO WORK CUTTING OUR 

1514
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,390
GRASS, FEEDING US, BRINGING IN 

1515
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:37,860
THE LABOR FORCE THAT WE NEED 

1516
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:38,861
AND NOW WE TURN ON THEM? 

1517
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:42,164
THAT REALLY STRUCK AT THE HEART 

1518
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:45,667
OF WHAT HE THOUGHT OUR GREAT 

1519
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:47,503
COUNTRY WAS ABOUT. 

1520
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:49,605
I BELIEVE IT COST HIM A 

1521
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:50,105
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. 

1522
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:53,976
SO TO ME IT'S VERY DEAR WHAT 

1523
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,510
THE SENATOR IS ABOUT. 

1524
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:59,181
TO ME JOHN REALLY DID REFLECT 

1525
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:02,384
OUR COUNTRY IN ITS TRUE FORM. 

1526
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:04,953
MY FATHER IS A MARINE, PASSED 

1527
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:06,088
AWAY IN FEBRUARY. 

1528
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:11,126
ONCE A MARINE, ALWAYS A MARINE 

1529
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:12,628
HE'D SAY. 

1530
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:15,030
GOT WOUNDED IN GUAM, PURPLE 

1531
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:15,263
HEART. 

1532
01:12:15,263 --> 01:12:18,867
WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT JOHN 

1533
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:21,136
McCAIN, HE SAID HE UNDERSTANDS 

1534
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:21,703
US. 

1535
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:23,305
HE UNDERSTANDS US. 

1536
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:25,474
AND I MUST CONFESS HE DID 

1537
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:25,841
UNDERSTAND US. 

1538
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:29,545
HE UNDERSTOOD ALL OF US WHETHER 

1539
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:31,914
IT WAS WHITE, BLACK, BROWN, 

1540
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:32,147
ASIAN. 

1541
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:34,383
TO HIM IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY 

1542
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:34,683
DIFFERENCE. 

1543
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:39,955
WHAT HE KNEW IS THAT WE ALL 

1544
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:40,689
MAKE AMERICA GREAT. 

1545
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:45,160
WE ALL MAKE AMERICA GREAT. 

1546
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:51,600
SO I HOPE THAT IN HIS LEGACY 

1547
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,003
THE SENATORS, GOVERNORS, 

1548
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:59,475
MAYORS, CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, 

1549
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:00,542
ELECTED OFFICIALS EMBRACE THE 

1550
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:03,645
THOUGHT OF LOVE BECAUSE JOHN 

1551
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,882
REFLECTED LOVE AND LOVE OF A 

1552
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:11,620
STRONG MAN, AND THAT IS 

1553
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,421
NOWADAYS HARD TO COME BY. 

1554
01:13:13,421 --> 01:13:17,892
SO HIS LEGACY WILL GO ON FOR 

1555
01:13:17,892 --> 01:13:18,560
GENERATIONS BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL 

1556
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,164

1557
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:26,301

1559

DEPART. 

1565
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:52,261

01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:32,774
OF BOUNDS. 

1630
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:33,942
[ LAUGHTER  ] 

1631
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:36,011
>> HE WAS THE EPITOME OF 

1632
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:40,682
TOUGHNESS, AND I DO EVERYTHING 

1633
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,650
I CAN TO AVOID CONTACT. 

1634
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:45,320
I HAVE FLOWING LOCKS, AND, 

1635
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,321
WELL, HE DIDN'T. 

1636
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:47,555
[ LAUGHTER  ] 

1637
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:50,992
>> HOW DOES THIS UNLIKELY PAIR 

1638
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:51,359
BECOME FRIENDS? 

1639
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:52,494
I'VE ASKED MYSELF THIS SAME 

1640
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:52,961
QUESTION. 

1641
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:55,630
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER 

1642
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:55,796
IS? 

1643
01:18:55,796 --> 01:18:56,832
THAT'S JUST WHO HE IS. 

1644
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:59,501
OVER THE SEVERAL YEARS I HAD 

1645
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:00,602
THE PRIVILEGE OF SPENDING TIME 

1646
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:02,304
WITH SENATOR McCAIN, SOMETIMES 

1647
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:03,872
IT WAS JUST A VISIT TO OUR 

1648
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:05,841
PRACTICES, OTHER TIMES IT WAS 

1649
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:09,678
HIM TEXTING AND SAYING YOU NEED 

1650
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:12,948
TO PICK IT UP THIS SUNDAY. 

1651
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:14,149
[ LAUGHTER  ] I'M THANKFUL THAT 

1652
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:15,450
THROUGH THESE MOMENTS THE 

1653
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:19,454
OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAD TO 

1654
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:20,989
SHARE OUR LIVES AND MORE 

1655
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:22,023
IMPORTANTLY OUR STORIES WHILE 

1656
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,125
FROM VERY DIFFERENT WORLDS WE 

1657
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,060
DEVELOPED A MEANINGFUL 

1658
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:25,360
FRIENDSHIP. 

1659
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,429
AND THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE VERY 

1660
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,730
RARE AND VERY SPECIAL QUALITIES 

1661
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,765
OF SENATOR McCAIN THAT I CAME 

1662
01:19:30,765 --> 01:19:31,500
TO DEEPLY ADMIRE. 

1663
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,502
HE DIDN'T JUDGE INDIVIDUALS 

1664
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:36,471
BASED ON THE COLOR OF THEIR 

1665
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:39,341
SKIN, THEIR GENDER, THEIR 

1666
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:39,941
BACKGROUNDS, THEIR POLITICAL 

1667
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:40,575
AFFILIATIONS OR THEIR BANK 

1668
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:40,942
ACCOUNTS. 

1669
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:44,379
HE EVALUATED THEM ON THE MERITS 

1670
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:46,114
OF THEIR CHARACTER AND THE 

1671
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:46,714
COUNTENANCE OF THEIR HEARTS. 

1672
01:19:46,714 --> 01:19:48,416
HE JUDGED THEM ON THE WORK THEY 

1673
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:51,319
PUT IN AND THE PRINCIPLES THEY 

1674
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:51,586
LIVED BY. 

1675
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:53,388
IT WAS THIS APPROACH TO 

1676
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:55,690
HUMANITY THAT MADE SENATOR JOHN 

1677
01:19:55,690 --> 01:20:00,362
McCAIN SO RESPECTED BY 

1678
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:01,595
COUNTLESS PEOPLE AROUND THE 

1679
01:20:01,595 --> 01:20:03,364
WORLD, INCLUDING ME. 

1680
01:20:03,364 --> 01:20:06,101
HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE MANY, 

1681
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:09,805
U.S. SENATOR, PRESIDENTIAL 

1682
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,007
CANDIDATE, STATESMAN, WARRIOR 

1683
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:12,440
AND HERO. 

1684
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,474
HIS WORK ETHIC TIRELESS. 

1685
01:20:13,474 --> 01:20:13,942
HIS FIGHT LEGENDARY. 

1686
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:16,545
BUT WHAT MADE SENATOR McCAIN SO 

1687
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,446
SPECIAL WAS THAT HE CARED ABOUT 

1688
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:20,949
THE SUBSTANCE OF MY HEART, MORE 

1689
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:22,851
SO THAN WHERE I CAME FROM. 

1690
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,219
WHILE SOME MIGHT FIND OUR 

1691
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:27,355
FRIENDSHIP OUT OF THE ORDINARY, 

1692
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:30,025
IT WAS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF 

1693
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,192
WHAT MADE HIM AN ICONIC FIGURE 

1694
01:20:31,192 --> 01:20:35,130
OF AMERICAN POLITICS AND 

1695
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:36,131
SERVICE TO FELLOW MAN. 

1696
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:38,199
HE CELEBRATED DIFFERENCES. 

1697
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:39,234
HE EMBRACED HUMANITY, 

1698
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:41,469
CHAMPIONED WHAT WAS TRUE AND 

1699
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:44,839
JUST AND SAW PEOPLE FOR WHO 

1700
01:20:44,839 --> 01:20:45,139
THEY WERE. 

1701
01:20:45,139 --> 01:20:47,475
YES, OURS WAS AN UNLIKELY 

1702
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:49,744
FRIENDSHIP, BUT IT'S ONE THAT I 

1703
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:50,277
WILL ALWAYS CHERISH. 

1704
01:20:50,277 --> 01:20:52,814
I'VE HAD THE HONOR OF ATTENDING 

1705
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:56,585
SEVERAL OF THE SEDONA FORUMS 

1706
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:58,219
HOSTED BY SENATOR McCAIN AND 

1707
01:20:58,219 --> 01:20:59,621
HIS REMARKABLE WIFE CINDY. 

1708
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:01,289
THERE WERE WORLD LEADERS IN 

1709
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:02,891
POLITICS, BUSINESS, SCIENCE AND 

1710
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:05,460
EDUCATION TO DISCUSS THE MOST 

1711
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:08,530
PRESSING MATTERS OF OUR TIME, 

1712
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,498
ISSUES LIKE HEALTHCARE, GLOBAL 

1713
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,334
WARMING, TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN 

1714
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:12,667
TRAFFICKING. 

1715
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,436
THESE LEADERS GATHERED TO FIND 

1716
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:15,170
REAL SOLUTIONS, AND THEY 

1717
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:18,073
GATHERED BECAUSE SENATOR McCAIN 

1718
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:19,341
ASKED THEM TO BE THERE. 

1719
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:21,309
HIS DEVOTION TO MAKING ARIZONA 

1720
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:23,378
THE UNITED STATES AND THE WHOLE 

1721
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,613
WORLD A BETTER PLACE FOR 

1722
01:21:25,613 --> 01:21:27,615
EVERYONE HAS INSPIRED COUNTLESS 

1723
01:21:27,615 --> 01:21:28,850
LEADERS, LIKE THOSE AT THE 

1724
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:29,217
SEDONA FORUMS. 

1725
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:30,652
I'M CONFIDENT HIS LEGACY OF 

1726
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:32,454
DEVOTION AND TO THE COMMON GOOD 

1727
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:37,392
WILL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE PEOPLE 

1728
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:38,026
AROUND THE WORLD LONG AFTER 

1729
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:38,259
TODAY. 

1730
01:21:38,259 --> 01:21:39,461
A FEW YEARS AGO HE WAS KIND 

1731
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:41,362
ENOUGH TO TAKE ME ON A PERM 

1732
01:21:41,362 --> 01:21:43,031
TOUR OF THE U.S. -- PERSONAL 

1733
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,465
TOUR OF THE U.S. SENATE. 

1734
01:21:44,465 --> 01:21:48,203
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT SENATOR 

1735
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:49,069
McCAIN WAS HIGHLY REGARDED. 

1736
01:21:49,069 --> 01:21:51,973
HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT AND WAS 

1737
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:52,674
GOOD REGARDLESS OF WHICH 

1738
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:54,843
POLITICAL SIDE OF THE AISLE HIS 

1739
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:55,543
OPINION FELL ON. 

1740
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:58,346
I SAW HOW RESPECTED HE WAS AND 

1741
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:00,615
HOW MUCH ADMIRATION HE 

1742
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:03,018
COMMANDED FROM PEOPLE FROM 

1743
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:04,185
ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. 

1744
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:04,818
BUT THAT ADMIRATION WASN'T 

1745
01:22:04,818 --> 01:22:07,055
SURPRISING BECAUSE SENATOR 

1746
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:10,225
McCAIN WAS KNOWN AS A MAN OF 

1747
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:11,626
INTEGRITY AND CONVICTION, A MAN 

1748
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:14,429
WHO AT TIMES JUST AS HE 

1749
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:15,663
SACRIFICED HIMSELF FOR HIS 

1750
01:22:15,663 --> 01:22:16,831
FELLOW POWs IN VIETNAM 

1751
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:17,699
WILLINGLY CHOSE TO SACRIFICE 

1752
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:19,567
HIS OWN POLITICAL GAINS IN 

1753
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:20,869
ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT HE 

1754
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,570
BELIEVED WAS BEST FOR ALL. 

1755
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:24,506
AS A RESULT OF THIS TYPE OF 

1756
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:25,707
SACRIFICE, HE MAY HAVE LOST THE 

1757
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:27,575
SUPPORT OF A POLITICAL ALLY 

1758
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:31,146
HERE AND THERE, BUT HE GAINED 

1759
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:32,547
THE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION OF 

1760
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:33,181
AN ENTIRE NATION. 

1761
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:34,983
IN CLOSING, I'D LIKE TO HONOR 

1762
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:37,852
THE LOVE I SAW IN SENATOR 

1763
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:38,520
McCAIN. 

1764
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,489
HE LOVED THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA, 

1765
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:42,657
SERVING THEM PASSIONATELY AND 

1766
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:43,224
DILIGENTLY FOR DECADES. 

1767
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:45,326
HE TOOK THAT SAME LOVE TO 

1768
01:22:45,326 --> 01:22:46,528
WASHINGTON AND BOLDLY ADVOCATED 

1769
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:49,864
FOR FREEDOMS AND LIBERTIES HE 

1770
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,533
HAD GROWN TO LOVE AS A YOUNG 

1771
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:51,866
NAVY PILOT. 

1772
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:55,270
BUT THE LOVE I SAW MOST WAS THE 

1773
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:57,972
LOVE HE HAD FOR HIS WIFE CINDY 

1774
01:22:57,972 --> 01:22:58,539
AND HIS CHILDREN. 

1775
01:22:58,539 --> 01:23:01,042
I HEARD HIM SPEAK ABOUT THEM 

1776
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:04,813
OFTEN AND THE LOVE ALWAYS CAME 

1777
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,114
POURING THROUGH IN EVERY WORD. 

1778
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,749
SENATOR McCAIN, IT'S BEEN A 

1779
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:14,089
TRUE HONOR TO CALL YOU FRIEND. 

1780
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:14,956
YOUR TOUGHNESS AND BRAVERY 

1781
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:16,891
INSPIRED US, YOUR SACRIFICE AND 

1782
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:17,692
RISK OUR LIVES. 

1783
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:20,095
YOUR DEVOTION TO THE PEOPLE OF 

1784
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:21,763
ARIZONA, OUR NATION AND YOUR 

1785
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:23,498
CONVICTIONS WON OUR ADMIRATION. 

1786
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:26,267
YOUR LOVE SET AN EXAMPLE FOR 

1787
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:27,635
ALL OF US TO FOLLOW. 

1788
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:28,302
JACKIE ROBINSON ONCE SAID THAT 

1789
01:23:28,302 --> 01:23:30,171
LIFE IS NOT IMPORTANT EXCEPT IN 

1790
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:34,542
THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS ON OTHER 

1791
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:34,775
LIVES. 

1792
01:23:34,775 --> 01:23:35,409
SENATOR McCAIN, WE WILL MISS 

1793
01:23:35,409 --> 01:23:38,213
THE BLESSINGS OF BEING IN YOUR 

1794
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:39,180
PRESENCE, BUT WE WILL NEVER 

1795
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,248
FORGET THE IMPACT YOU HAD ON 

1796
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:43,618
THE WORLD, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY 

1797
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:45,687
ON EACH OF THE LIVES THAT YOU 

1798
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:46,387
TOUCHED. 

1799
01:23:46,387 --> 01:23:50,825
WE ARE ALL BETTER FOR HAVING 

1800
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:51,726
KNOWN YOU. 

1801
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:59,601
REST IN PEACE, MY FRIEND. 

1802
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:08,943
[ APPLAUSE  ] 

1803
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:15,049
>>> MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN. 

1804
01:24:15,049 --> 01:24:20,221
[ LAUGHTER  ] 

1805
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:23,825
>> I'M A DEMOCRAT. 

1806
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:27,629
[ LAUGHTER  ] AND I LOVED JOHN 

1807
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:28,897
McCAIN. 

1808
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:37,572
I HAVE HAD THE DUBIOUS HONOR 

1809
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,340
OVER THE YEARS OF GIVING SOME 

1810
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:45,313
EULOGIES FOR FINE WOMEN AND MEN 

1811
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:49,684
THAT I'VE ADMIRED, BUT, 

1812
01:24:49,684 --> 01:24:50,685
LINDSEY, THIS ONE IS HARD. 

1813
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:54,756
THE THREE MEN WHO SPOKE BEFORE 

1814
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:56,224
ME I THINK CAPTURED JOHN, 

1815
01:24:56,224 --> 01:25:00,695
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF JOHN IN A 

1816
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:06,267
WAY THAT ONLY SOMEONE CLOSE TO 

1817
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:07,168
HIM COULD UNDERSTAND. 

1818
01:25:07,168 --> 01:25:11,339
BUT THE WAY I LOOK AT IT, THE 

1819
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:15,477
WAY I THOUGHT ABOUT IT WAS I 

1820
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:17,712
ALWAYS THOUGHT OF JOHN AS A 

1821
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:22,317
BROTHER, WE HAD A HELL OF A LOT 

1822
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:23,451
OF FAMILY FIGHTS. 

1823
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:25,353
WE GO BACK A LONG WAY. 

1824
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:28,021
I WAS A YOUNG UNITED STATES 

1825
01:25:28,021 --> 01:25:28,288
SENATOR. 

1826
01:25:28,288 --> 01:25:30,091
I GT ELECTED WHEN I WAS 29, 

1827
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:31,392
AND I HAD THE DUBIOUS 

1828
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:35,163
DISTINCTION OF BEING PUT ON THE 

1829
01:25:35,163 --> 01:25:35,829
FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE 

1830
01:25:35,829 --> 01:25:43,671
WHICH THE NEXT YOUNGEST PERSON 

1831
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:46,073
WAS 14 YEARS OLDER THAN ME. 

1832
01:25:46,073 --> 01:25:50,845
AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME 

1833
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:52,347
TRAVELING THE WORLD BECAUSE I 

1834
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:53,448
WAS ASSIGNED A RESPONSIBILITY 

1835
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:55,183
MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE 

1836
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:57,285
KNOW, I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE 

1837
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:57,952
EUROPEAN AFFAIRS SUBCOMMITTEE, 

1838
01:25:57,952 --> 01:26:02,724
SO I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON 

1839
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:04,525
NATO AND THEN THE SOVIET UNION. 

1840
01:26:04,525 --> 01:26:07,595
AND ALONG CAME A GUY A COUPLE 

1841
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:12,767
YEARS LATER, A GUY I KNEW OF, 

1842
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:14,269
ADMIRED FROM AFAR, YOUR HUSBAND 

1843
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:19,841
WHO HAD BEEN A PRISONER OF WAR, 

1844
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:26,748
WHO HAD ENDURED ENORMOUS, 

1845
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:32,287
ENORMOUS PAIN AND SUFFERING AND 

1846
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:33,588
DEMONSTRATED THE CODE, THE 

1847
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:34,822
McCAIN CODE. 

1848
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:36,491
PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT IT 

1849
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:39,093
MUCH TODAY, BUT IMAGINE HAVING 

1850
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:41,229
ALREADY KNOWN THE PAIN YOU WERE 

1851
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:44,932
LIKELY TO ENDURE AND BEING 

1852
01:26:44,932 --> 01:26:48,769
OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO 

1853
01:26:48,769 --> 01:26:49,403
HOME BUT SAY NO. 

1854
01:26:49,403 --> 01:26:51,573
AS THE SON CAN TELL YOU IN THE 

1855
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:55,977
NAVY, THE LAST ONE IN, THE LAST 

1856
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:56,878
ONE OUT. 

1857
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,345
SO I KNEW OF JOHN. 

1858
01:26:58,345 --> 01:27:02,684
AND JOHN BECAME THE NAVY 

1859
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:03,785
LIAISON OFFICER IN THE UNITED 

1860
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:04,252
STATES SENATE. 

1861
01:27:04,252 --> 01:27:07,288
THERE WAS AN OFFICE -- THEN IT 

1862
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:09,190
USED TO BE ON THE BASEMENT 

1863
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:12,293
FLOOR OF MEMBERS OF THE 

1864
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:13,260
MILITARY WHO ARE ASSIGNED TO 

1865
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,495
SENATORS WHEN THEY TRAVEL 

1866
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:21,069
ABROAD TO MEET WITH HEADS OF 

1867
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:22,003
STATE OR OTHER FOREIGN 

1868
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:22,503
DIGNITARIES. 

1869
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:26,641
AND JOHN HAD BEEN RECENTLY 

1870
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:30,078
RELEASED FROM THE HANOI HILTON, 

1871
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,447
A GENUINE HERO AND BECAME THE 

1872
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:32,780
NAVY LIAISON. 

1873
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:38,219
FOR SOME REASON WE HIT IT OFF 

1874
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:41,222
FROM THE BEGINNING. 

1875
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:44,525
WE WERE BOTH FULL OF DREAMS AND 

1876
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:44,825
AMBITIONS. 

1877
01:27:44,825 --> 01:27:49,564
AND AN OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO 

1878
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:51,332
MAKE THE TIME WE HAD THERE 

1879
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:53,601
WORTHWHILE, TO DO THE RIGHT 

1880
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:55,069
THING, TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE 

1881
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:59,807
COULD MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR 

1882
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:01,241
THE COUNTRY WE LOVED SO MUCH. 

1883
01:28:01,241 --> 01:28:03,678
AND JOHN AND I ENDED UP 

1884
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:05,213
TRAVELING EVERY TIME I WENT 

1885
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:06,814
ANYWHERE, I TOOK JOHN WITH ME 

1886
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:10,285
OR JOHN TOOK ME WITH HIM, AND 

1887
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,519
WE WERE IN CHINA, JAPAN, 

1888
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:12,186
RUSSIA, GERMANY, FRANCE, 

1889
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:17,291
ENGLAND, TURKEY, ALL OVER THE 

1890
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:20,094
WORLD, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 

1891
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:22,530
MILES, AND WE WOULD SIT ON THAT 

1892
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:23,965
PLANE, AND LATE IN THE NIGHT 

1893
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:27,435
WHEN EVERYONE ELSE WAS ASLEEP 

1894
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:29,671
AND JUST TALK, GETTING TO KNOW 

1895
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:30,004
ONE ANOTHER. 

1896
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:30,704
WE'D TALK ABOUT FAMILY. 

1897
01:28:30,704 --> 01:28:35,409
WE'D TALK ABOUT POLITICS. 

1898
01:28:35,409 --> 01:28:36,844
WE'D TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL 

1899
01:28:36,844 --> 01:28:37,144
RELATIONS. 

1900
01:28:37,144 --> 01:28:40,748
WE'D TALK ABOUT PROMISE, THE 

1901
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:43,117
PROMISE OF AMERICA BECAUSE WE 

1902
01:28:43,117 --> 01:28:44,352
BOTH ARE COCKEYED OPTIMISTS AND 

1903
01:28:44,352 --> 01:28:45,453
REALLY BELIEVE THERE'S NOT A 

1904
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:46,454
SINGLE THING BEYOND THE 

1905
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:52,393
CAPACITY OF THIS COUNTRY, I 

1906
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:54,729
MEAN, FOR REAL, NOT A SINGLE 

1907
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:56,731
THING, AND WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW 

1908
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:58,366
ANOTHER WOMAN OR MAN, YOU GET 

1909
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:00,501
TO KNOW THEIR HOPES AND THEIR 

1910
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:01,903
FEARS, YOU GET TO KNOW THEIR 

1911
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:03,171
FAMILY EVEN BEFORE YOU MEET 

1912
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:06,174
THEM, YOU GET TO KNOW HOW THEY 

1913
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,743
FEEL ABOUT REALLY IMPORTANT -- 

1914
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:10,278
WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING 

1915
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:12,013
EXCEPT CAPTIVITY AND THE LOSS 

1916
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:13,848
OF MY FAMILY WHICH HAD JUST 

1917
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:19,620
OCCURRED, MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER, 

1918
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,655
ONLY TWO THINGS WE DIDN'T TALK 

1919
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:20,888
ABOUT. 

1920
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:24,826
BUT I FOUND THAT IT WASN'T TOO 

1921
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:27,695
LONG INTO JOHN'S DUTIES THAT 

1922
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:31,399
JILL AND I GOT MARRIED, AND 

1923
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:34,268
JILL IS WITH ME HERE TODAY. 

1924
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:37,338
FIVE YEARS I HAD BEEN A SINGLE 

1925
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:40,775
DAD, AND NO MAN DESERVES ONE 

1926
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:45,346
GREAT LOVE, LET ALONE TWO, AND 

1927
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:46,080
I MET JILL. 

1928
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:46,480
CHANGED MY LIFE. 

1929
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:51,786
AND SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM 

1930
01:29:51,786 --> 01:29:53,120
AND HE WITH HER. 

1931
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,590
HE'D ALWAYS CALL HER, AS 

1932
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:56,924
LINDSEY WOULD LATER TRAVEL WITH 

1933
01:29:56,924 --> 01:29:59,460
US, CALL HER JILLY. 

1934
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:00,561
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHEN 

1935
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:03,564
THEY'D GET BORED BEING WITH ME 

1936
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:05,199
ON THESE TRIPS, I REMEMBER 

1937
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,734
GOING TO SEE GREECE AND I SAID 

1938
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,537
WHY DON'T I JUST TAKE YOU ALL 

1939
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:11,705
TO DINNER. 

1940
01:30:11,705 --> 01:30:13,274
I LATER LEARNED THEY'RE DOWN IN 

1941
01:30:13,274 --> 01:30:16,010
A CAFE AT THE PORT, AND HE HAS 

1942
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:27,989
HER DANCING ON TOP OF A CEMENT 

1943
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:28,589
TABLE DRINKING NEWZO. 

1944
01:30:28,589 --> 01:30:28,889
NOT A JOKE. 

1945
01:30:28,889 --> 01:30:29,122
JILLY. 

1946
01:30:29,122 --> 01:30:29,490
RIGHT, JILLY? 

1947
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:31,793
SO -- BUT WE GOT TO KNOW EACH 

1948
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:35,062
OTHER WELL AND HE LOVED MY SON 

1949
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:35,663
BEAU AND MY SON HUNT. 

1950
01:30:35,663 --> 01:30:40,902
AS A YOUNG MAN, HE CAME UP TO 

1951
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:43,171
MY HOUSE, HE'D COME UP TO 

1952
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:46,541
WILMINGTON, AND OUT OF THIS 

1953
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:51,479
GREW A GREAT FRIENDSHIP THAT 

1954
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:52,446
TRANSCENDED WHATEVER POLITICAL 

1955
01:30:52,446 --> 01:30:57,585
DIFFERENCES WE HAD OR LATER 

1956
01:30:57,585 --> 01:30:59,287
DEVELOPED BECAUSE ABOVE ALL, 

1957
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:02,957
ABOVE ALL WE UNDERSTOOD THE 

1958
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:04,291
SAME THING, ALL POLITICS IS 

1959
01:31:04,291 --> 01:31:04,692
PERSONAL. 

1960
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:05,859
IT'S ALL ABOUT TRUST. 

1961
01:31:05,859 --> 01:31:07,128
I TRUSTED JOHN WITH MY LIFE, 

1962
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:11,165
AND I WOULD, AND I THINK HE 

1963
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:14,602
WOULD TRUST ME WITH HIS. 

1964
01:31:14,602 --> 01:31:18,205
WE BOTH KNEW THEN FROM OUR 

1965
01:31:18,205 --> 01:31:19,273
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES THAT -- 

1966
01:31:19,273 --> 01:31:21,375
AND AS I PROGRESSED WE LEARNED 

1967
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:24,211
EVEN MORE, THAT THERE ARE TIMES 

1968
01:31:24,211 --> 01:31:30,985
WHEN LIFE CAN BE SO CRUEL, PAIN 

1969
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:34,956
SO BLINDING IT'S HARD TO SEE 

1970
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:35,323
ANYTHING ELSE. 

1971
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:36,724
THE DISEASE THAT TOOK JOHN'S 

1972
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:38,459
LIFE TOOK OUR MUTUAL FRIEND 

1973
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:39,894
TEDDY'S LIFE, THE EXACT SAME 

1974
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:41,696
DISEASE NINE YEARS AGO A COUPLE 

1975
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:46,133
DAYS AGO, AND THREE YEARS AGO 

1976
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:51,872
IT TOOK MY BEAUTIFUL SON BEAU'S 

1977
01:31:51,872 --> 01:31:52,072
LIFE. 

1978
01:31:52,072 --> 01:31:52,406
IT'S BRUTAL. 

1979
01:31:52,406 --> 01:31:53,107
IT'S RELENTLESS, IT'S 

1980
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:53,440
UNFORGIVING. 

1981
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,309
AND IT TAKES SO MUCH FROM THOSE 

1982
01:31:55,309 --> 01:31:58,012
WE LOVE AND FROM THE FAMILIES 

1983
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:05,119
WHO LOVE THEM THAT IN ORDER TO 

1984
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,890
SURVIVE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HOW 

1985
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:09,757

1991
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:27,308

LOOKING AT YOU. 

2007

OR WHEN YOU SAW THE SHEER JOY 

2008
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,284
THAT CROSSED HIS FACE THE 

2009
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:12,186
MOMENT HE THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT 

2010
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:17,591
TO GET UP ON THE SENATE FLOOR 

2011
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:18,459
AND START A FIGHT. 

2012
01:33:18,459 --> 01:33:19,226

MRS. McCAIN, WE KNOW HOW 

2019
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:36,243
DIFFICULT IT IS TO BURY A

IT'S LIKE BEING SUCKED INTO A

BLACK HOLE INSIDE YOUR CHEST, 

2030
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,869
AND IT'S FRIGHTENING. 

2031
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:02,870
BUT I KNOW SOMETHING ELSE, 

2032
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:03,537
UNFORTUNATELY, FROM EXPERIENCE 

2033
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:06,107
THAT THERE'S NOTHING ANYONE CAN 

2034
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:11,579
SAY OR DO TO EASE THE PAIN 

2035
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:12,813

2036
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:16,851

SOME COMFORT KNOWING THAT 

2038
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:23,357

BUT PART OF -- PART OF IT WAS 

2048

AND I'VE GOTTEN CALLS NOT JUST 

2054
01:35:04,932 --> 01:35:06,267
BECAUSE PEOPLE KNEW WE WERE 

2055

2056
01:35:10,604 --> 01:35:15,476

2062
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:40,701
JOHN HAD CHARACTER. 

2063
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:45,573
WHILE OTHERS WILL MISS HIS 

2064
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:46,273
LEADERSHIP AND HIS PASSION, 

2065
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:52,446
EVEN HIS STUBBORNNESS, YOU'RE 

2066
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:56,183

FOR YOU. 

2073
01:36:09,363 --> 01:36:12,266
AND FOR THAT THERE'S NO BOMB 

2074

BECAUSE AS THEY LOOKED AT HIM, 

2111
01:37:48,228 --> 01:37:49,363
IN ONE SENSE THEY ADMIRED HIM, 

2112

JOHN CAME FROM ANOTHER AGE THAT 

2116
01:37:59,606 --> 01:38:04,979
LIVED BY A DIFFERENT CODE, AN

2141
01:39:32,565 --> 01:39:37,504
THEY LOOK AT US A LITTLE NAIVE. 

2142
01:39:37,504 --> 01:39:40,140
WE ARE SO FAIR AND DECENT. 

2143
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:41,675
WE ARE THE NAIVE AMERICANS.

THAT'S WHO WE ARE. 

2145
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:48,081
THAT'S WHO JOHN WAS. 

2146
01:39:48,081 --> 01:39:54,321
HE COULD NOT STAND THE ABUSE OF

ARE PART OF SOMETHING MUCH 

2157
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:20,280
BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. 

2158
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:23,484
WITH JOHN IT WAS A VALUE SET 

2159
01:40:23,484 --> 01:40:30,324
THAT WAS NEITHER SELFISH NOR 

2160
01:40:30,324 --> 01:40:30,657

FIRST AND FOREMOST AN IDEA. 

2163
01:40:39,466 --> 01:40:45,806
RISKY, ORGANIZED AROUND NOT 

2164
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:46,906
TRIBE BUT AROUND IDEALS. 

2165
01:40:46,906 --> 01:40:50,310
THINK OF HOW HE APPROACHED 

2166
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:50,911
EVERY ISSUE. 

2167
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:52,112
THE IDEALS THAT AMERICANS HAVE 

2168
01:40:52,112 --> 01:40:57,317
RALLY ADD ROUND FOR OVER200 

2169
01:40:57,317 --> 01:40:58,251
YEARS HAS PREPARED YOU. 

2170
01:40:58,251 --> 01:41:04,657
AN IDEA IN THE CONSTITUTION. 

2171
01:41:04,657 --> 01:41:05,759
SOUNDS CORNY. 

2172
01:41:05,759 --> 01:41:06,827
WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS 

2173
01:41:06,827 --> 01:41:11,698
SELFEVIDENT THAT ALL MEN ARE 

2174
01:41:11,698 --> 01:41:14,835
CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR 

2175
01:41:14,835 --> 01:41:16,369
YETOR WITH CERTAIN RIGHTS. 

2176
01:41:16,369 --> 01:41:19,339
TO JOHN THOSE WORDS HAD MEANING 

2177
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:22,910
AS THEY HAVE FOR EVERY GREAT 

2178
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:27,581
PATRIOT THAT HAS EVER SERVED 

2179
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:28,181
THIS COUNTRY. 

2180
01:41:28,181 --> 01:41:30,950
WE BOTH LOVED THE SENATE. 

2181
01:41:30,950 --> 01:41:32,953
PROUDEST YEARS OF MY LIFE FOR 

2182
01:41:32,953 --> 01:41:34,620
BEING A UNITED STATES SENATOR. 

2183
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:37,758
I WAS HONORED TO BE VICE 

2184
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:39,059
PRESIDENT. 

2185
01:41:39,059 --> 01:41:40,360
BEING A UNITED STATES STATES 

2186
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:44,765
SENATOR AND WE BOTH LAMENTED 

2187
01:41:44,765 --> 01:41:45,565
WATCHING IT CHANGE. 

2188
01:41:45,565 --> 01:41:47,935
DURING LONG DEBATES IN THE 80'S 

2189
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:49,303
AND 90s SOME OF THE COLLEAGUE 

2190
01:41:49,303 --> 01:41:51,105
AROUND THEN WOULD KNOW I WOULD 

2191
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:53,307
GO OVER AND SIT NEXT TO JOHN. 

2192
01:41:53,307 --> 01:41:54,007
NEXT TO HIS SEAT. 

2193
01:41:54,007 --> 01:41:55,476
HE WOULD COME OVER ON THE 

2194
01:41:55,476 --> 01:42:00,013
DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND SIT NEXT TO 

2195
01:42:00,013 --> 01:42:00,213
ME. 

2196
01:42:00,213 --> 01:42:00,513
NOT JOKING. 

2197
01:42:00,513 --> 01:42:04,017
WE WOULD SIT THERE AND TALK TO 

2198
01:42:04,017 --> 01:42:04,350
EACH OTHER. 

2199
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:07,621
I CAN REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN I 

2200
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:13,260
CAME OUT TO SEE JOHN. 

2201
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:13,826
WE TALKED ABOUT IT. 

2202
01:42:13,826 --> 01:42:19,566
WE WERE ABOUT  -- ALL THE 

2203
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:22,336
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS HAVE LUNCH 

2204
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:23,136
AND ALL THE REPUBLICAN 

2205
01:42:23,136 --> 01:42:23,570
SENATORS. 

2206
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:26,707
WE BOTH WENT IN OUR CAUCUS AND 

2207
01:42:26,707 --> 01:42:29,443
WE WERE APPROACHED BY OUR 

2208
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:31,311
LEADERS WITH THE SAME THING. 

2209
01:42:31,311 --> 01:42:32,145
IT RAISED THE DISCUSSION. 

2210
01:42:32,145 --> 01:42:34,314
JOE IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD, YOU 

2211
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:37,517
SITTING NEXT TO JOHN ALL THE 

2212
01:42:37,517 --> 01:42:37,717
TIME. 

2213
01:42:37,717 --> 01:42:39,620
I SWEAR TO GOD. 

2214
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:43,657
SAME THING WAS SAID TO JOHN. 

2215
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:46,360
THAT IS WHEN THINGS STARTED TO 

2216
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:49,463
CHANGE FOR THE WORST IN AMERICA 

2217
01:42:49,463 --> 01:42:53,600
IN THE SENATE. 

2218
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,134
THAT'S WHEN IT CHANGED. 

2219
01:42:55,134 --> 01:42:59,940
WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT THOSE 

2220
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:01,875
TIMES, IT WAS ALWAYS 

2221
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:04,544
APPROPRIATE TO CHALLENGE 

2222
01:43:04,544 --> 01:43:05,746
ANOTHER SENATOR'S JUDGEMENT BUT 

2223
01:43:05,746 --> 01:43:07,781
NOT THEIR MOTIVE. 

2224
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:09,549
WHEN YOU CHALLENGE THEIR MOTIVE 

2225
01:43:09,549 --> 01:43:11,718
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET TO GO. 

2226
01:43:11,718 --> 01:43:13,587
IF I SAY YOU ARE DOING THIS 

2227
01:43:13,587 --> 01:43:14,454
BECAUSE YOU ARE BEING PAID OFF, 

2228
01:43:14,454 --> 01:43:15,856
IF I SAY YOU ARE DOING THIS 

2229
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:16,857
BECAUSE ARE YOU NOT A GOOD 

2230
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:18,191
CHRISTIAN F I SAY YOU ARE DOING 

2231
01:43:18,191 --> 01:43:20,460
THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE THIS THAT 

2232
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:23,864
OR THE OTHER THING IT'S 

2233
01:43:23,864 --> 01:43:24,865
IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH CONSENSUS. 

2234
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:31,904
THINK ABOUT IN YOUR PERSONAL 

2235
01:43:31,904 --> 01:43:32,239
LIVES. 

2236
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:35,842
ALL WE DO TODAY IS A TACK THE 

2237
01:43:35,842 --> 01:43:41,448
OPPOSITIONS OF BOTH PARTIES. 

2238
01:43:41,448 --> 01:43:41,815
THEIR MOTIVES. 

2239
01:43:41,815 --> 01:43:47,587
NOT THE SUBSTANCE OF THEIR 

2240
01:43:47,587 --> 01:43:47,854
ARGUMENT. 

2241
01:43:47,854 --> 01:43:48,955
THIS IS THE MID90'S. 

2242
01:43:48,955 --> 01:43:54,460
WILL IT BEGIN TO GO DOWNHILL 

2243
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:54,794
FROM THERE? 

2244
01:43:54,794 --> 01:43:59,499
THE LAST DAY JOHN WAS ON THE 

2245
01:43:59,499 --> 01:44:01,101
SENATE FLOOR WHAT WAS HE 

2246
01:44:01,101 --> 01:44:02,268
FIGHTING TO DO? 

2247
01:44:02,268 --> 01:44:07,474
HE WAS FIGHTING TO RESTORE  

2248
01:44:07,474 --> 01:44:09,276
WHATWE CALL REGULAR ORDER, TO 

2249
01:44:09,276 --> 01:44:11,445
START TO TREAT ONE ANOTHER 

2250
01:44:11,445 --> 01:44:12,745
AGAIN LIKE WE USED TO. 

2251
01:44:12,745 --> 01:44:14,181
SENATE WAS NEVER PERFECT, JOHN, 

2252
01:44:14,181 --> 01:44:14,581
YOU KNOW THAT. 

2253
01:44:14,581 --> 01:44:17,884
WE WERE THERE A LONG TIME 

2254
01:44:17,884 --> 01:44:18,285
TOGETHER. 

2255
01:44:18,285 --> 01:44:20,187
I WOULD WATCH TEDDY KENNEDY AND 

2256
01:44:20,187 --> 01:44:21,388
JAMES EASTLAND FIGHT LIKE HELL 

2257
01:44:21,388 --> 01:44:30,263
ON CIVIL RIGHTS AND THEN GO 

2258
01:44:30,263 --> 01:44:32,265
HAVE LUNCH TOGETHER. 

2259
01:44:32,265 --> 01:44:35,202
JOHN WANTED TO SEE REGULAR 

2260
01:44:35,202 --> 01:44:40,274
ORDER WRIT LARGE, GET TO KNOW 

2261
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:40,607
ONE ANOTHER. 

2262
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:46,179
YOU KNOW JOHN AND I WERE BOTH 

2263
01:44:46,179 --> 01:44:51,251
AMU SED WHERE WE GOT TWO AWARDS 

2264
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:55,522
THE LAST YEAR I WAS VICE 

2265
01:44:55,522 --> 01:44:59,092
PRESIDENT AND THEN ONE 

2266
01:44:59,092 --> 01:45:00,193
IMMEDIATELY AFTER FOR OUR 

2267
01:45:00,193 --> 01:45:01,928
DIGNITY AND RESPECT WE SHOWED 

2268
01:45:01,928 --> 01:45:04,163
TO ONE ANOTHER. 

2269
01:45:04,163 --> 01:45:08,235
WE RECEIVED AN AWARD FOR 

2270
01:45:08,235 --> 01:45:09,770
CILIVITY IN PUBLIC LIFE. 

2271
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:12,239
IT WAS A COLLEGE THAT PUTS OUT 

2272
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:18,078
THIS AWARD EVERY YEAR FOR 

2273
01:45:18,078 --> 01:45:18,378
BIPARTISAN. 

2274
01:45:18,378 --> 01:45:22,482
WE SAID WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? 

2275
01:45:22,482 --> 01:45:23,083
NOT A JOKE. 

2276
01:45:23,083 --> 01:45:24,484
I SAID TO SENATOR FLAKE THAT'S 

2277
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:26,285
HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. 

2278
01:45:26,285 --> 01:45:31,124
YOU ARE GETTING AN AWARD? 

2279
01:45:31,124 --> 01:45:32,191
I'M SERIOUS. 

2280
01:45:32,191 --> 01:45:35,529
THINK ABOUT THIS. 

2281
01:45:35,529 --> 01:45:38,799
GETTING AN AWARD FOR YOUR 

2282
01:45:38,799 --> 01:45:39,599
CIVILITY. 

2283
01:45:39,599 --> 01:45:44,471
GETTING AN AWARD FOR BEING 

2284
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:44,771
BIPARTISAN. 

2285
01:45:44,771 --> 01:45:45,772
CLASSIC JOHN, ONE AT ALLEGANY 

2286
01:45:45,772 --> 01:45:46,372
COLLEGE, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE 

2287
01:45:46,372 --> 01:45:48,408
THERE AND WE GOT THE AWARD AND 

2288
01:45:48,408 --> 01:45:51,411
JOHN -- THE SENATE WAS IN 

2289
01:45:51,411 --> 01:45:52,412
SESSION AND HE SPOKE FIRST. 

2290
01:45:52,412 --> 01:45:54,181
AS HE WALKED OFF THE STAGE AND 

2291
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:55,982
I WALKED ON HE LOOKED AT ME AND 

2292
01:45:55,982 --> 01:45:57,184
SAID JOE, DON'T TAKE IT 

2293
01:45:57,184 --> 01:45:58,085
PERSONALLY BUT I JUST DON'T 

2294
01:45:58,085 --> 01:46:01,421
WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE HELL YOU 

2295
01:46:01,421 --> 01:46:12,599
HAVE TO SAY AND HE LEFT. 

2296
01:46:15,235 --> 01:46:16,103
ONE OF HIS MAJOR CAMPAIGN 

2297
01:46:16,103 --> 01:46:18,405
PEOPLE IS NOW WITH THE SENATE, 

2298
01:46:18,405 --> 01:46:20,507
WITH THE GOVERNOR OF OHIO WAS 

2299
01:46:20,507 --> 01:46:25,379
ON THIS MORNING AND I HAPPENED 

2300
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:25,979
TO WATCH IT. 

2301
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:27,981
HE SAID THAT BIDEN AND McCAIN 

2302
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:28,982
HAD THIS STRANGE RELATIONSHIP. 

2303
01:46:28,982 --> 01:46:31,818
THEY ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE EACH 

2304
01:46:31,818 --> 01:46:32,151
OTHER'S BACK. 

2305
01:46:32,151 --> 01:46:35,922
WHEN I WAS IN TROUBLE JOHN WAS 

2306
01:46:35,922 --> 01:46:37,557
THE FIRST GUY THERE. 

2307
01:46:37,557 --> 01:46:41,328
I HOPE I WAS THERE FOR HIM. 

2308
01:46:41,328 --> 01:46:42,929
WE NEVER HESITATED TO GIVE EACH 

2309
01:46:42,929 --> 01:46:43,262
OTHER ADVICE. 

2310
01:46:43,262 --> 01:46:44,531
HE CALLED ME IN THE MIDDLE OF 

2311
01:46:44,531 --> 01:46:47,434
CAMPAIGN AND SAID WHAT THE HELL 

2312
01:46:47,434 --> 01:46:49,035
DID YOU SAY THAT FOR? 

2313
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:51,705
WASN'T ON AN ISSUE, LIKE YOU 

2314
01:46:51,705 --> 01:46:55,108
JUST SCREWED UP, JOE. 

2315
01:46:55,108 --> 01:46:56,710
I WOULD SOMETIMES CALL HIM. 

2316
01:46:56,710 --> 01:46:58,644
LOOK, I HAVE BEEN THINKING THIS 

2317
01:46:58,644 --> 01:47:02,249
WEEK ABOUT WHY JOHN'S DEATH HAS 

2318
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:03,216
HIT THE COUNTRY SO HARD. 

2319
01:47:03,216 --> 01:47:06,286
YES, HE WAS A LONG SERVING 

2320
01:47:06,286 --> 01:47:07,253
SENATOR WITH A REMARKABLE 

2321
01:47:07,253 --> 01:47:07,554
RECORD. 

2322
01:47:07,554 --> 01:47:09,856
YES, HE WAS A TWO TIME 

2323
01:47:09,856 --> 01:47:11,358
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO 

2324
01:47:11,358 --> 01:47:13,627
CAPTURED THE SUPPORT AND 

2325
01:47:13,627 --> 01:47:14,461
IMAGINATION OF THE AMERICAN 

2326
01:47:14,461 --> 01:47:14,694
PEOPLE. 

2327
01:47:14,694 --> 01:47:17,731
YES, JOHN WAS A WAR HERO AND 

2328
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:18,331
DEMONSTRATED EXTRAORDINARY 

2329
01:47:18,331 --> 01:47:22,435
COURAGE I THINK OF JOHN AND MY 

2330
01:47:22,435 --> 01:47:25,138
SON WHEN I THINK OF INGORSOLL'S 

2331
01:47:25,138 --> 01:47:27,307
WORDS, WHEN DUTY THROWS A 

2332
01:47:27,307 --> 01:47:28,708
GAUNTLET DOWN TO FATE. 

2333
01:47:28,708 --> 01:47:31,478
WHEN HONOR SCORNS TO COMPROMISE 

2334
01:47:31,478 --> 01:47:35,515
WITH DEATH, THAT IS HEROISM. 

2335
01:47:35,515 --> 01:47:37,017
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT ABOUT 

2336
01:47:37,017 --> 01:47:38,451
JOHN. 

2337
01:47:38,451 --> 01:47:41,955
I DON'T THINK IT FULLY EXPLAINS 

2338
01:47:41,955 --> 01:47:46,660
WHY THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SO 

2339
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,694
TAKEN BY JOHN'S PASSING. 

2340
01:47:48,694 --> 01:47:51,498
I THINK ITS SOMETHING MORE 

2341
01:47:51,498 --> 01:47:52,866
INTANG IB LE. 

2342
01:47:52,866 --> 01:47:56,869
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY KNEW 

2343
01:47:56,869 --> 01:47:58,338
JOHN BELIEVED SO DEEPLY AND 

2344
01:47:58,338 --> 01:48:02,809
WITH SO MUCH PASSION IN THE 

2345
01:48:02,809 --> 01:48:07,481
SOUL OF AMERICA THAT HE MADE IT 

2346
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:11,684
EASIER FOR THEM TO HAVE 

2347
01:48:11,684 --> 01:48:13,553
CONFIDENCE AND FAITH IN 

2348
01:48:13,553 --> 01:48:14,688
AMERICA. 

2349
01:48:14,688 --> 01:48:19,693
HIS FAITH IN THE CORE VALUES OF 

2350
01:48:19,693 --> 01:48:27,267
THIS NATION MADE THEM SOMEHOW 

2351
01:48:27,267 --> 01:48:28,168
FEEL IT MORE THEMSELVES. 

2352
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:31,338
HIS CONVICTION THAT WE AS A 

2353
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:32,939
COUNTRY WOULD NEVER WALK AWAY 

2354
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:34,674
FROM THE SACRIFICES GENERATIONS 

2355
01:48:34,674 --> 01:48:36,242
OF AMERICANS HAVE MADE TO 

2356
01:48:36,242 --> 01:48:39,546
DEFEND LIBERTY AND FREEDOM AND 

2357
01:48:39,546 --> 01:48:41,681
HUMAN DIGNITY AROUND THE WORLD. 

2358
01:48:41,681 --> 01:48:46,286
IT MADE AVERAGE AMERICANS PROUD 

2359
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:48,388
OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR 

2360
01:48:48,388 --> 01:48:48,655
COUNTRY. 

2361
01:48:48,655 --> 01:48:52,959
HIS BELIEF AND IT WAS DEEP THAT 

2362
01:48:52,959 --> 01:48:57,897
AMERICANS CAN DO ANYTHING ; 

2363
01:48:57,897 --> 01:49:00,200
WITH STAND ANYTHING, ACHIEVE 

2364
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,067
ANYTHING. 

2365
01:49:01,067 --> 01:49:02,469
IT WAS BOTH UNFLAGGING AND 

2366
01:49:02,469 --> 01:49:07,474
REASSURING THAT THIS MAN 

2367
01:49:07,474 --> 01:49:09,142
BELIEVED THAT SO STRONGLY. 

2368
01:49:09,142 --> 01:49:11,144
HIS CAPACITY THAT WE ARE THE 

2369
01:49:11,144 --> 01:49:12,746
WORLD'S LAST BEST HOPE. 

2370
01:49:12,746 --> 01:49:15,048
THAT WE ARE THE BEACON TO THE 

2371
01:49:15,048 --> 01:49:16,249
WORLD, THAT THERE ARE 

2372
01:49:16,249 --> 01:49:16,983
PRINCIPLES AND IDEALS GREATER 

2373
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:20,887
THAN OURSELVES AND WE ARE 

2374
01:49:20,887 --> 01:49:24,491
SUFFERING, SACRIFICING FOR AND 

2375
01:49:24,491 --> 01:49:25,392
IF NECESSARY DYING FOR. 

2376
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:30,296
AMERICANS SAW HOW HE LIVED HIS 

2377
01:49:30,296 --> 01:49:30,764
LIFE THAT WAY. 

2378
01:49:30,764 --> 01:49:34,067
THEY KNEW THE TRUTH OF WHAT HE 

2379
01:49:34,067 --> 01:49:34,367
WAS SAYING. 

2380
01:49:34,367 --> 01:49:43,343
I JUST THINK HE GAVE AMERICANS 

2381
01:49:43,343 --> 01:49:43,643
CONFIDENCE. 

2382
01:49:43,643 --> 01:49:46,479
JOHN WAS A HERO. 

2383
01:49:46,479 --> 01:49:49,449
HIS CHARACTER, COURAGE, HONOR, 

2384
01:49:49,449 --> 01:49:49,749
INTEGRITY. 

2385
01:49:49,749 --> 01:49:53,587
I THINK THE THINGS UNDERSTATED 

2386
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:56,388
THE MOST IS HIS OPTIMISM. 

2387
01:49:56,388 --> 01:49:58,325
THAT'S WHAT MADE JOHN SPECIAL. 

2388
01:49:58,325 --> 01:50:02,095
MADE JOHN A GIANT AMONG ALL OF 

2389
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:02,261
US. 

2390
01:50:02,261 --> 01:50:03,296
IN MY VIEW JOHN DIDN'T BELIEVE 

2391
01:50:03,296 --> 01:50:10,537
THAT AMERICA'S FUTURE AND FATE 

2392
01:50:10,537 --> 01:50:10,937
RESTED ON HEROS. 

2393
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:12,405
WE USED TO TALK AND KNOW MOST 

2394
01:50:12,405 --> 01:50:13,473
ABOUT HIM, WHAT HE UNDERSTOOD 

2395
01:50:13,473 --> 01:50:18,078
WHAT I HOPE WE ALL REMEMBER. 

2396
01:50:18,078 --> 01:50:19,179
HEROS DIDN'T BUILD THIS 

2397
01:50:19,179 --> 01:50:19,479
COUNTRY. 

2398
01:50:19,479 --> 01:50:20,981
ORDINARY PEOPLE BEING GIVEN 

2399
01:50:20,981 --> 01:50:28,521
HALF A CHANCE ARE CAPABLE OF 

2400
01:50:28,521 --> 01:50:29,555
DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. 

2401
01:50:29,555 --> 01:50:30,022
EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. 

2402
01:50:30,022 --> 01:50:30,623
JOHN KNEW ORDINARY AMERICANS 

2403
01:50:30,623 --> 01:50:35,528
KNEW THAT EACH OF US HAD A DUTY 

2404
01:50:35,528 --> 01:50:39,232
TO DEFEND THE BIRTH RIGHT OF 

2405
01:50:39,232 --> 01:50:40,266
EVERY CHILD THEY CARRIED. 

2406
01:50:40,266 --> 01:50:42,202
THAT GOOD COMMUNITIES ARE BUILT 

2407
01:50:42,202 --> 01:50:45,472
BY THOUSANDS OF SMALL ACTS OF 

2408
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:46,706
DECENCY, THAT AMERICA AS I 

2409
01:50:46,706 --> 01:50:50,610
SPEAK TODAY SHOWS EACH OTHER 

2410
01:50:50,610 --> 01:50:51,478
EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT BURIED 

2411
01:50:51,478 --> 01:50:54,581
DEEP IN THE DNA OF THIS 

2412
01:50:54,581 --> 01:50:55,982
NATION'S SOUL LIES THE FLAME 

2413
01:50:55,982 --> 01:50:58,618
THAT WAS LIT OVER 200 YEARS 

2414
01:50:58,618 --> 01:50:58,818
AGO. 

2415
01:50:58,818 --> 01:51:00,954
THAT EACH OF US CARRY WAS US 

2416
01:51:00,954 --> 01:51:04,457
AND EACH US HAS THE CAPACITY, 

2417
01:51:04,457 --> 01:51:06,526
THE RESPONSIBILITY AND WE CAN 

2418
01:51:06,526 --> 01:51:08,628
SCREW UP THE COURAGE TO ENSURE 

2419
01:51:08,628 --> 01:51:11,531
IT'S NOT PUT OUT AND IT'S A 

2420
01:51:11,531 --> 01:51:14,434
THOUSAND LITTLE THINGS THAT 

2421
01:51:14,434 --> 01:51:15,802
MAKE US DIFFERENT. 

2422
01:51:15,802 --> 01:51:18,972
THE BOTTOM LINE WAS I THINK 

2423
01:51:18,972 --> 01:51:19,973
JOHN BELIEVED IN US. 

2424
01:51:19,973 --> 01:51:23,076
I THINK HE BELIEVED IN THE 

2425
01:51:23,076 --> 01:51:28,214
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

2426
01:51:28,214 --> 01:51:30,150
NOT JUST ALL THE PREAMBLES. 

2427
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:32,952
HE BELIEVED IN THE AMERICAN 

2428
01:51:32,952 --> 01:51:33,185
PEOPLE. 

2429
01:51:33,185 --> 01:51:34,020
ALL 325 MILLION OF US. 

2430
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:35,522
EVEN THOUGH JOHN IS NO LONGER 

2431
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:39,926
WITH US HE LEFT US PRETTY CLEAR 

2432
01:51:39,926 --> 01:51:40,259
INSTRUCTIONS. 

2433
01:51:40,259 --> 01:51:43,530
QUOTE, BELIEVE ALWAYS IN THE 

2434
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:47,500
PROMISE AND GREATNESS OF 

2435
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:49,636
AMERICA BECAUSE NOTHING IS 

2436
01:51:49,636 --> 01:51:50,536
INEVITABLE HERE. 

2437
01:51:50,536 --> 01:51:52,672
CLOSE TO THE LAST THING JOHN 

2438
01:51:52,672 --> 01:51:54,073
SAID TOOK THE WHOLE NATION AS 

2439
01:51:54,073 --> 01:51:59,579
HE KNEW HE WAS ABOUT TO DEPART. 

2440
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:03,483
THAT IS WHAT HE WANTED AMERICA 

2441
01:52:03,483 --> 01:52:04,017
TO UNDERSTAND. 

2442
01:52:04,017 --> 01:52:05,751
NOT TO BUILD HIS LEGACY. 

2443
01:52:05,751 --> 01:52:10,723
HE WANTED AMERICAN TO REMIND 

2444
01:52:10,723 --> 01:52:11,324
AND TO UNDERSTAND. 

2445
01:52:11,324 --> 01:52:13,226
I THINK JOHN'S LEGACY WILL 

2446
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:15,528
CONTINUE TO INSPIRE AND 

2447
01:52:15,528 --> 01:52:17,330
CHALLENGE GENERATIONS OF 

2448
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:19,232
LEADERS AS THEY STEP FORWARD 

2449
01:52:19,232 --> 01:52:22,735
AND JOHN McCAIN'S IMPACT ON 

2450
01:52:22,735 --> 01:52:24,704
AMERICA IS NOT OVER. 

2451
01:52:24,704 --> 01:52:25,605
IT'S NOT OVER. 

2452
01:52:25,605 --> 01:52:28,207
I TONIGHT THINK IT'S EVEN 

2453
01:52:28,207 --> 01:52:28,441
CLOSE. 

2454
01:52:28,441 --> 01:52:31,010
CINDY, JOHN OWED SO MUCH OF 

2455
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:33,846
WHAT HE WAS TO YOU. 

2456
01:52:33,846 --> 01:52:34,646
YOU WERE HIS BALLAST. 

2457
01:52:34,646 --> 01:52:36,015
WHEN I WAS WITH YOU BOTH I 

2458
01:52:36,015 --> 01:52:38,718
COULD JUST SEE HOW HE LOOKED AT 

2459
01:52:38,718 --> 01:52:38,918
YOU. 

2460
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:41,020
JILL IS THE ONE WHEN WE WERE IN 

2461
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:43,056
HAWAII AND HE FIRST MET YOU 

2462
01:52:43,056 --> 01:52:43,289
THERE. 

2463
01:52:43,289 --> 01:52:44,324
HE KEPT LOOKING AT YOU AND JILL 

2464
01:52:44,324 --> 01:52:53,633
SAID GO UP AND TALK TO HER. 

2465
01:52:53,633 --> 01:52:55,635
YOU MAY NOT HAVE HAD YOUR 

2466
01:52:55,635 --> 01:52:58,104
FATHER AS LONG AS YOU WOULD 

2467
01:52:58,104 --> 01:53:01,174
HAVE LIKED BUT YOU GOT FROM HIM 

2468
01:53:01,174 --> 01:53:04,076
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO PURSUE 

2469
01:53:04,076 --> 01:53:05,812
YOUR OWN DREAMS. 

2470
01:53:05,812 --> 01:53:09,082
TO FOLLOW THE COURSE OF YOUR 

2471
01:53:09,082 --> 01:53:10,383
OWN SPIRIT. 

2472
01:53:10,383 --> 01:53:12,151
YOU ARE A LIVING LEGACY. 

2473
01:53:12,151 --> 01:53:19,359
YOU ARE A LIVING LEGACY AND 

2474
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:21,461
PROOF OF JOHN McCAIN'S  

2475
01:53:21,461 --> 01:53:23,630
SUCCESS. 

2476
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:26,165
NOW JOHN WILL TAKE HIS RIGHTFUL 

2477
01:53:26,165 --> 01:53:28,735
PLACE IN THE LONG LINE OF 

2478
01:53:28,735 --> 01:53:29,535

2482
01:53:38,211 --> 01:53:43,316
MADE THE AMERICAN STORY THE

01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,556
I KNOW JOHN SAID HE HOPED HE 

2486
01:53:50,556 --> 01:53:54,761
PLAYED A SMALL PART IN THAT

2488
01:53:54,994 --> 01:54:04,404

02:11:06,258 --> 02:11:11,029
BUT THROUGH IT ALL, WHEN THERE 

2703
02:11:11,029 --> 02:11:17,436
WAS DOUBT I ENDED UP AND SPIT 

2704
02:11:17,436 --> 02:11:17,903
IT OUT. 

2705
02:11:17,903 --> 02:11:25,477
I FACED IT ALL AND I STOOD TALL 

2706
02:11:25,477 --> 02:11:33,452
AND DID IT MY WAY. 

2707
02:11:33,452 --> 02:11:37,422
I'VE LOVED, I'VE LAUGHED AND 

2708
02:11:37,422 --> 02:11:37,655
CRIED. 

2709
02:11:37,655 --> 02:11:46,231
I'VE HAD MY FILL, MY SHARE OF 

2710
02:11:46,231 --> 02:11:46,464
LOSING. 

2711
02:11:46,464 --> 02:11:54,106
AND NOW, AS TEARS SUBSIDE, I 

2712
02:11:54,106 --> 02:11:58,610
FIND IT ALL SO AMUSING TO THINK 

2713
02:11:58,610 --> 02:12:01,513
I DID ALL THAT AND MAY I SAY. 

2714
02:12:01,513 --> 02:12:03,815
>>  CAN'T IMAGINE A MORE 

2715
02:12:03,815 --> 02:12:05,517
FITTING END TO THIS MEMORIAL 

2716
02:12:05,517 --> 02:12:08,353
SERVICE IN ARIZONA AT THE NORTH 

2717
02:12:08,353 --> 02:12:09,254
PHOENIX BAPTIST CHURCH. 

2718
02:12:09,254 --> 02:12:11,656
WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING INTO 

2719
02:12:11,656 --> 02:12:15,226
ABOUT A 90 MINUTE SERVICE BY 

2720
02:12:15,226 --> 02:12:16,628
FRIENDS AND FAMILY HONORING THE 

2721
02:12:16,628 --> 02:12:18,730
LATE SENATOR AND HIS LIFE. 

2722
02:12:18,730 --> 02:12:20,866
IT WAS A CEREMONY WITH TEARS 

2723
02:12:20,866 --> 02:12:23,468
AND WITH A GREAT DEAL OF 

2724
02:12:23,468 --> 02:12:24,402
LAUGHTER AND LOVING MEMORIES. 

2725
02:12:24,402 --> 02:12:27,406
>>> I WANT TO BRING IN NANCY 

2726
02:12:27,406 --> 02:12:31,343
CORD IS WHO IS JUST OUTSIDE THE 

2727
02:12:31,343 --> 02:12:31,676
PHOENIX AREA. 

2728
02:12:31,676 --> 02:12:32,577
BOY WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY. 

2729
02:12:32,577 --> 02:12:33,011
I HAVE TO SAY. 

2730
02:12:33,011 --> 02:12:36,314
I THINK IT WAS THE LAST TIME WE 

2731
02:12:36,314 --> 02:12:38,082
HONORED THE LIFE OF MOHAMMED 

2732
02:12:38,082 --> 02:12:38,517
ALI. 

2733
02:12:38,517 --> 02:12:41,820
A FUNERAL THAT WAS SO EMBRACING 

2734
02:12:41,820 --> 02:12:43,388
SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE. 

2735
02:12:43,388 --> 02:12:45,523
STRUCK ALSO BY JOE BIDEN'S 

2736
02:12:45,523 --> 02:12:45,790
REMARKS. 

2737
02:12:45,790 --> 02:12:46,258
>>  YEAH. 

2738
02:12:46,258 --> 02:12:48,160
I THINK SOMETHING THAT YOU 

2739
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:49,428
HEARD FROM BIDEN AND REALLY 

2740
02:12:49,428 --> 02:12:51,963
EVERY PERSON WHO SPOKE IN THIS 

2741
02:12:51,963 --> 02:12:53,265
REMARKABLE MEMORIAL SERVICE WAS 

2742
02:12:53,265 --> 02:12:54,966
THE FACT THAT THEY STRUCK WITH 

2743
02:12:54,966 --> 02:12:57,736
-- WHAT MAY HAVE SEEMED AT THE 

2744
02:12:57,736 --> 02:12:59,571
BEGINNING LIKE AN UNLIKELY 

2745
02:12:59,571 --> 02:13:00,939
FRIENDSHIP WITH JOHN McCAIN, 

2746
02:13:00,939 --> 02:13:04,343
JOE BIDEN A BIG DEMOCRAT, JOHN 

2747
02:13:04,343 --> 02:13:05,110
McCAIN WAS REPUBLICAN. 

2748
02:13:05,110 --> 02:13:05,811
LARRY FITZGERALD STAR ATHLETE 

2749
02:13:05,811 --> 02:13:07,345
TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WAS BLACK 

2750
02:13:07,345 --> 02:13:10,015
AND JOHN McCAIN WAS WHITE. 

2751
02:13:10,015 --> 02:13:14,052
HE WAS YOUNG, JOHN McCAIN WAS 

2752
02:13:14,052 --> 02:13:14,252
OLD. 

2753
02:13:14,252 --> 02:13:16,955
TOMMY ESPINOZA TALKED ABOUT THE 

2754
02:13:16,955 --> 02:13:17,856
FACT THAT McCAIN REPEATEDLY 

2755
02:13:17,856 --> 02:13:20,258
ASKED HIM TO STAND BY HIM, 

2756
02:13:20,258 --> 02:13:22,060
ASKED HIM TO CO CHAIR HIS 

2757
02:13:22,060 --> 02:13:23,361
SENATE CAMPAIGN, ASKED HIM TO 

2758
02:13:23,361 --> 02:13:26,131
SPEAK FOR HIM AT THE GOP 

2759
02:13:26,131 --> 02:13:26,698
PRESIDENTIAL CONVENTION AND 

2760
02:13:26,698 --> 02:13:28,567
EACH TIME HE SAID TO HIM YOU 

2761
02:13:28,567 --> 02:13:29,801
KNOW I'M A DEMOCRAT RIGHT? 

2762
02:13:29,801 --> 02:13:33,338
DON'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE A 

2763
02:13:33,338 --> 02:13:34,439
PROBLEM? 

2764
02:13:34,439 --> 02:13:35,741
YET, THEY ALL STRUCK THESE 

2765
02:13:35,741 --> 02:13:36,641
FRIENDSHIPS WITH HIM AND RIGHT 

2766
02:13:36,641 --> 02:13:39,411
NOW BEHIND ME AS YOU CAN SEE 

2767
02:13:39,411 --> 02:13:41,012
THE CASKET IS BEING BROUGHT OUT 

2768
02:13:41,012 --> 02:13:43,949
TO THE HEARSE BY THE HONOR 

2769
02:13:43,949 --> 02:13:44,182
GUARD. 

2770
02:13:44,182 --> 02:13:46,218
THEY SAID THAT THEY STRUCK UP 

2771
02:13:46,218 --> 02:13:47,052
THESE RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE 

2772
02:13:47,052 --> 02:13:49,855
WHILE POLITICS WAS IMPORTANT TO 

2773
02:13:49,855 --> 02:13:52,657
HIM, CHARACTER AND VALUES AND 

2774
02:13:52,657 --> 02:13:53,858
FUN WERE MORE IMPORTANT. 

2775
02:13:53,858 --> 02:13:56,461
YOU KNOW JUST REMARKABLE TO 

2776
02:13:56,461 --> 02:13:58,363
HEAR FROM THESE MEN AND WOMEN 

2777
02:13:58,363 --> 02:14:00,065
WHO HAD THESE VERY, VERY CLOSE 

2778
02:14:00,065 --> 02:14:01,566
FRIENDSHIPS WITH HIM FOR 

2779
02:14:01,566 --> 02:14:02,067
DECADES. 

2780
02:14:02,067 --> 02:14:05,303
>>  WE ARE SEEING NOW BRIDGETT 

2781
02:14:05,303 --> 02:14:10,742
AND THE CHILDREN OF JOHN McCAIN 

2782
02:14:10,742 --> 02:14:11,008
ENTERING. 

2783
02:14:11,008 --> 02:14:11,509
YOU HAVE INTERVIEWED. 

2784
02:14:11,509 --> 02:14:16,348
TELL US WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU. 

2785
02:14:16,348 --> 02:14:18,750
>>  FIRST OF ALL HOW ACCESSIBLE 

2786
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:22,987
HE WAS TO US WHICH IS ALWAYS 

2787
02:14:22,987 --> 02:14:23,521
SOMETHING REPORTERS LOVE. 

2788
02:14:23,521 --> 02:14:25,891
HE NEVER --  YOU KNOW SHIED 

2789
02:14:25,891 --> 02:14:26,224
AWAY FROM US. 

2790
02:14:26,224 --> 02:14:27,292
ALWAYS STOPPED TO TALK EVEN IF 

2791
02:14:27,292 --> 02:14:28,860
IT WAS JUST FOR A MOMENT. 

2792
02:14:28,860 --> 02:14:30,795
EVEN IF IT WAS JUST TO CRACK A 

2793
02:14:30,795 --> 02:14:31,163
JOKE. 

2794
02:14:31,163 --> 02:14:32,364
HE WANTED US TO KNOW HOW HE 

2795
02:14:32,364 --> 02:14:36,200
FELT ABOUT A VARIETY OF ISSUES. 

2796
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:37,769
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MORE HE 

2797
02:14:37,769 --> 02:14:38,937
TALKED ABOUT HIS POINT OF VIEW 

2798
02:14:38,937 --> 02:14:40,338
AND SOMETIME ITSELF WAS A VERY 

2799
02:14:40,338 --> 02:14:42,240
LONELY POINT OF VIEW IN HIS 

2800
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:43,942
PARTY, THE MORE HE SPOKE TO US 

2801
02:14:43,942 --> 02:14:47,746
THE EASY TERRACE FOR HIM TO GET 

2802
02:14:47,746 --> 02:14:49,480
HIS MESSAGE OUT THERE. 

2803
02:14:49,480 --> 02:14:52,050
EVEN WHEN HE GOT SICK AND HE 

2804
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:54,085
CLEARLY COULDN'T SPEAK AS WELL 

2805
02:14:54,085 --> 02:14:55,754
AS HE HAD BEFORE, AT ONE POINT 

2806
02:14:55,754 --> 02:14:58,189
HE WAS BOUND TO A WHEELCHAIR. 

2807
02:14:58,189 --> 02:14:58,590
HE HAD SURGERY. 

2808
02:14:58,590 --> 02:15:00,759
YOU COULD TELL HE WAS IN PAIN. 

2809
02:15:00,759 --> 02:15:02,060
HE STILL STOPPED AND WOULD JOKE 

2810
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:04,595
AND SAY I'M LIVING THE DREAM. 

2811
02:15:04,595 --> 02:15:07,599
I'M LIVING THE DREAM AND GO ON. 

2812
02:15:07,599 --> 02:15:09,434
HE HAD A LOT OF AFFECTION FOR 

2813
02:15:09,434 --> 02:15:11,369
REPORTERS AND YOU COULD -- PART 

2814
02:15:11,369 --> 02:15:14,039
OF THE REASON AS YOU HEARD JOE 

2815
02:15:14,039 --> 02:15:17,342
BIDEN DESCRIBE SO WELL IN HIS 

2816
02:15:17,342 --> 02:15:20,445
SPEECH IS THAT -- IS THAT JOHN 

2817
02:15:20,445 --> 02:15:22,948
McCAIN HATED ABUSE OF POWER IN 

2818
02:15:22,948 --> 02:15:24,216
ANY FORM, IN ANY COUNTRY AROUND 

2819
02:15:24,216 --> 02:15:27,786
THE WORLD AND HE VIEWED THE 

2820
02:15:27,786 --> 02:15:29,287
FREE PRESS AS AN ANTIDOTE TO 

2821
02:15:29,287 --> 02:15:29,788
THAT. 

2822
02:15:29,788 --> 02:15:30,554
>>  I'M JUST CURIOUS. 

2823
02:15:30,554 --> 02:15:33,291
FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AS A 

2824
02:15:33,291 --> 02:15:34,292
PRISONER OF WAR. 

2825
02:15:34,292 --> 02:15:34,826
BATTLING BRAIN CANCER. 

2826
02:15:34,826 --> 02:15:35,694
YOU DESCRIBED HIS LAST 

2827
02:15:35,694 --> 02:15:36,995
CONDITIONS IN THE LAST FEW 

2828
02:15:36,995 --> 02:15:37,595
WEEKS OF HIS LIFE. 

2829
02:15:37,595 --> 02:15:40,499
HOW WAS IT THAT HE WAS ABLE TO 

2830
02:15:40,499 --> 02:15:42,300
MAINTAIN SO MUCH OPTIMISM 

2831
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:42,801
THROUGH IT ALL? 

2832
02:15:42,801 --> 02:15:45,470
>>  FIRST OF ALL I THINK HE 

2833
02:15:45,470 --> 02:15:48,173
JUST HAD A VERY UNIQUE ENERGY 

2834
02:15:48,173 --> 02:15:51,843
LEVEL THAT MOST OF US CAN'T 

2835
02:15:51,843 --> 02:15:52,810
HOPE TO MATCH. 

2836
02:15:52,810 --> 02:15:53,945
WHEN THE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN 

2837
02:15:53,945 --> 02:15:55,046
WAS SAYING THEY WOULD TALK IN 

2838
02:15:55,046 --> 02:15:57,149
TO THE NIGHT WHEN EVERYBODY 

2839
02:15:57,149 --> 02:15:58,983
ELSE HAD GONE TO SLEEP. 

2840
02:15:58,983 --> 02:16:00,685
WE HAVE HEARD STOREYS LINDSEY 

2841
02:16:00,685 --> 02:16:02,988
GRAHAM AND OTHERS OF THOSE TWO 

2842
02:16:02,988 --> 02:16:05,390
JUST TALKING AND TALKING AND, 

2843
02:16:05,390 --> 02:16:07,259
YOU NEGOTIATION HE HAD A 

2844
02:16:07,259 --> 02:16:11,496
CAPACITY FOR A CONVERSATION.  

2845
02:16:17,135 --> 02:16:18,570
HE WAS ABLE TO GET MORE DONE 

2846
02:16:18,570 --> 02:16:19,270
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T FLAG. 

2847
02:16:19,270 --> 02:16:21,273
YOU THINK ABOUT THIS IS NOT 

2848
02:16:21,273 --> 02:16:26,177
ONLY A MAN WHOSE ARMS WERE 

2849
02:16:26,177 --> 02:16:27,879
BROKEN, WHO ENDURED TERRIBLE 

2850
02:16:27,879 --> 02:16:29,681
CONDITIONS AS A PRISONER OF WAR 

2851
02:16:29,681 --> 02:16:31,650
IN VIETNAM FOR SO MANY YEARS 

2852
02:16:31,650 --> 02:16:33,050
BUT ALSO BATTLED SKIN CANCER 

2853
02:16:33,050 --> 02:16:35,587
BEFORE HE GOT THE BRAIN CANCER 

2854
02:16:35,587 --> 02:16:35,887
DIAGNOSIS. 

2855
02:16:35,887 --> 02:16:37,522
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO THROUGHOUT 

2856
02:16:37,522 --> 02:16:39,991
HIS LIFE HAD TO DEAL WITH ANY 

2857
02:16:39,991 --> 02:16:41,425
NUMBER OF MEDICAL CHALLENGES 

2858
02:16:41,425 --> 02:16:42,894
AND WHEN I SPOKE TO GRANT WOODS 

2859
02:16:42,894 --> 02:16:45,230
THE OTHER DAY HE -- HE IS THE 

2860
02:16:45,230 --> 02:16:45,897
FORMER ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL 

2861
02:16:45,897 --> 02:16:47,299
WHO TALKED RIGHT AT THE START 

2862
02:16:47,299 --> 02:16:48,400
OF THE SERVICE AND HAD THAT 

2863
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:50,101
GREAT STORY ABOUT WHAT A 

2864
02:16:50,101 --> 02:16:52,671
TERRIBLE DRIVER McCAIN WAS BUT 

2865
02:16:52,671 --> 02:16:54,371
HE INSISTED ON DRIVING ANY WAY 

2866
02:16:54,371 --> 02:16:56,407
AND THAT WOODS WAS AFRAID FOR 

2867
02:16:56,407 --> 02:16:58,677
HIS LIFE BECAUSE WHEN McCAIN 

2868
02:16:58,677 --> 02:17:00,679
WOULD GET DISTRACTED THE CAR 

2869
02:17:00,679 --> 02:17:00,978
WOULD VEER. 

2870
02:17:00,978 --> 02:17:04,082
HE SAID DISPITT ALL OF THOSE 

2871
02:17:04,082 --> 02:17:06,251
INJURIES McCAIN JUST NEVER 

2872
02:17:06,251 --> 02:17:07,485
REALLY SLOWED DOWN. 

2873
02:17:07,485 --> 02:17:08,887
HE -- HE IGNORED THEM. 

2874
02:17:08,887 --> 02:17:11,222
HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY FOR 

2875
02:17:11,222 --> 02:17:12,891
EXAMPLE TO RIDE FIRST CLASS 

2876
02:17:12,891 --> 02:17:15,627
WHEN HE WENT BACK AND FORTH 

2877
02:17:15,627 --> 02:17:17,929
BETWEEN ARIZONA AND WASHINGTON 

2878
02:17:17,929 --> 02:17:18,129
DC. 

2879
02:17:18,129 --> 02:17:19,831
OF COURSE, WHEN YOU SEE A WAR 

2880
02:17:19,831 --> 02:17:21,398
HERO AND A SENATOR GETTING ON 

2881
02:17:21,398 --> 02:17:22,800
THE PLANE THE AIRLINE IS LIKELY 

2882
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:24,368
TO BUMP YOU UP TO FIRST CLASS. 

2883
02:17:24,368 --> 02:17:26,204
HE DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY THAT 

2884
02:17:26,204 --> 02:17:26,504
WOULD LOOK. 

2885
02:17:26,504 --> 02:17:28,206
SO HE WOULD SQUEEZE HIMSELF 

2886
02:17:28,206 --> 02:17:30,208
INTO AN ECONOMY SEAT WHICH OF 

2887
02:17:30,208 --> 02:17:31,509
COURSE HAD TO BE MUCH LESS 

2888
02:17:31,509 --> 02:17:32,777
COMFORTABLE FOR HIM THAN IT 

2889
02:17:32,777 --> 02:17:34,679
WOULD BE TO SIT IN THE FIRST 

2890
02:17:34,679 --> 02:17:35,379
CLASS SEAT. 

2891
02:17:35,379 --> 02:17:36,513
YOU KNOW WOODS AND OTHERS HAVE 

2892
02:17:36,513 --> 02:17:40,018
SAID THAT'S JUST NOT WHO HE 

2893
02:17:40,018 --> 02:17:40,251
WAS. 

2894
02:17:40,251 --> 02:17:42,387
>>  INCREDIBLE MOMENT. 

2895
02:17:42,387 --> 02:17:42,820
INCREDIBLE MEMORY. 

2896
02:17:42,820 --> 02:17:44,923
ON THE GROUND THERE OUTSIDE OF 

2897
02:17:44,923 --> 02:17:47,025
NORTH PHOENIX BAPTIST CHURCH.

02:17:47,025 --> 02:17:47,791
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

2899
02:17:47,791 --> 02:17:49,326

2900
02:17:49,326 --> 02:17:51,529

CHURCH. 

2904
02:17:56,267 --> 02:17:58,270
IT'LL MAKE ITS WAY TO THE 

2905
02:17:58,270 --> 02:18:00,805
AIRPORT WHERE IT'LL LEAVE LATER 

2906
02:18:00,805 --> 02:18:02,607
THIS AFTERNOON FOR WASHINGTON 

2907
02:18:02,607 --> 02:18:07,077
DC WHERE THE MEMORIES AND THE 

2908
02:18:07,077 --> 02:18:07,577
TRIBUTES WILL CONTINUE. 

2909
02:18:07,577 --> 02:18:09,214
THE FORMER SENATOR WILL LIE IN 

2910
02:18:09,214 --> 02:18:10,482
STATE AT THE CAPITOL AND 

2911
02:18:10,482 --> 02:18:13,218
FOLLOWED BY A SERVICE ON 

2912
02:18:13,218 --> 02:18:17,922
SATURDAY AT THE NATIONAL 

2913
02:18:17,922 --> 02:18:18,389
CATHEDRAL. 

2914
02:18:18,389 --> 02:18:22,861
>>> JOINING ME NOW IS DOUG 

2915
02:18:22,861 --> 02:18:23,061
WEED. 

2916
02:18:23,061 --> 02:18:24,895
I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS. 

2917
02:18:24,895 --> 02:18:27,264
DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE LEGACY 

2918
02:18:27,264 --> 02:18:30,067
OF JOHN McCAIN THAT PEOPLE 

2919
02:18:30,067 --> 02:18:31,835
REMEMBER THE MOST? 

2920
02:18:31,835 --> 02:18:36,007
>>  HIS BIPARTISAN AND REACHING 

2921
02:18:36,007 --> 02:18:37,108
OUT ACROSS THE AISLE. 

2922
02:18:37,108 --> 02:18:39,209
HIS INTEGRITY BECAUSE IT ALL 

2923
02:18:39,209 --> 02:18:40,712
STARTED THE KEATING FIVE AND 

2924
02:18:40,712 --> 02:18:42,746
THAT'S WHAT HE BUILT. 

2925
02:18:42,746 --> 02:18:45,517
WHAT STRUCK ME WATCHING THIS 

2926
02:18:45,517 --> 02:18:47,018
SERVICE WAS NOBODY TALKS ABOUT 

2927
02:18:47,018 --> 02:18:51,055
THIS BUT HE HAD A QUICK TEMPER 

2928
02:18:51,055 --> 02:18:52,790
AND JUST AS QUICKLY WOULD ASK 

2929
02:18:52,790 --> 02:18:53,958
YOU TO FORGIVE HIM. 

2930
02:18:53,958 --> 02:18:55,826
I HAD A FRIEND WHO -- HE MADE A 

2931
02:18:55,826 --> 02:18:56,093
MISTAKE. 

2932
02:18:56,093 --> 02:18:57,962
HE SAID THE WRONG THING ACT 

2933
02:18:57,962 --> 02:18:58,162
HER. 

2934
02:18:58,162 --> 02:19:01,433
HE APOLOGIZED AND HE SENT HER 

2935
02:19:01,433 --> 02:19:01,766
FLOWERS. 

2936
02:19:01,766 --> 02:19:03,034
HE WENT TO HEAR AND SAID I 

2937
02:19:03,034 --> 02:19:05,136
CAN'T KNEEL BECAUSE OF MY 

2938
02:19:05,136 --> 02:19:06,805
INJURIES BUT INSIDE I'M 

2939
02:19:06,805 --> 02:19:08,306
KNEELING ASKING YOU TO PLEASE 

2940
02:19:08,306 --> 02:19:10,508
FORGIVE ME AND THERE'S A STORY 

2941
02:19:10,508 --> 02:19:12,309
THAT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF 

2942
02:19:12,309 --> 02:19:14,245
GEORGE W BUSH TELLS SATURDAY 

2943
02:19:14,245 --> 02:19:16,114
THAT BACKSTAGE AT THE 

2944
02:19:16,114 --> 02:19:17,415
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IN DES 

2945
02:19:17,415 --> 02:19:19,017
MOINES THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY 

2946
02:19:19,017 --> 02:19:22,853
WHO WAS DYING OF BRAIN CANCER 

2947
02:19:22,853 --> 02:19:23,655
AND HE WANTED AUTOGRAPHS AND 

2948
02:19:23,655 --> 02:19:25,957
GEORGE W BUSH DID IT BUT HIS 

2949
02:19:25,957 --> 02:19:27,659
REAL HERO WAS JOHN McCAIN 

2950
02:19:27,659 --> 02:19:30,261
BECAUSE HIS OWN FATHER WAS A 

2951
02:19:30,261 --> 02:19:30,561
NAVY SEAL. 

2952
02:19:30,561 --> 02:19:35,767
AT THE TIME SENATOR McCAIN WAS 

2953
02:19:35,767 --> 02:19:37,067
VERY UPSET, THE DEBATE HADN'T 

2954
02:19:37,067 --> 02:19:37,936
GONE WELL. 

2955
02:19:37,936 --> 02:19:38,936
HE WAS RUSHING TO GET OUT OF 

2956
02:19:38,936 --> 02:19:40,839
THERE BACKSTAGE AND THE FATHER 

2957
02:19:40,839 --> 02:19:42,707
OF THIS BOY RAISED DOWN THE 

2958
02:19:42,707 --> 02:19:45,744
CORRIDOR, TAPPED HIM ON THE 

2959
02:19:45,744 --> 02:19:48,046
BACK AND McCAIN TURNED AROUND 

2960
02:19:48,046 --> 02:19:49,914
IN ANGER, WHAT'S GOING ON? 

2961
02:19:49,914 --> 02:19:51,816
CINDY TOUCHED HIM TO CALM DOWN 

2962
02:19:51,816 --> 02:19:54,686
AND THEY EXPLAINED THIS BOY 

2963
02:19:54,686 --> 02:19:57,755
WANTED AUTOGRAPH AND McCAIN 

2964
02:19:57,755 --> 02:19:58,055
JUST BROKE. 

2965
02:19:58,055 --> 02:19:59,891
HE SAID I'M SO SORRY AND HE 

2966
02:19:59,891 --> 02:20:00,859
SIGNED THIS LONG AUTOGRAPH. 

2967
02:20:00,859 --> 02:20:03,862
I THOUGHT OF THAT AS I WATCHED 

2968
02:20:03,862 --> 02:20:05,964
THE SERVICE BECAUSE JOHN McCAIN 

2969
02:20:05,964 --> 02:20:07,565
DIED OF BRAIN CANCER THOSE MANY 

2970
02:20:07,565 --> 02:20:07,898
YEARS LATER. 

2971
02:20:07,898 --> 02:20:09,868
>>  YOU TALK ABOUT BRAIN 

2972
02:20:09,868 --> 02:20:11,202
CANCER. 

2973
02:20:11,202 --> 02:20:13,538
IT WAS SO MANY PEOPLE 

2974
02:20:13,538 --> 02:20:16,341
MENTIONING ABOUT TED KENNEDY 

2975
02:20:16,341 --> 02:20:17,742
ALSO ABOUT JOE BIDEN'S SON, ALL 

2976
02:20:17,742 --> 02:20:19,477
-- ENDED UP DYING FROM BRAIN 

2977
02:20:19,477 --> 02:20:21,446
CANCER AS WELL. 

2978
02:20:21,446 --> 02:20:24,148
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS -- HIS 

2979
02:20:24,148 --> 02:20:26,484
FIGHT REALLY AT THE END, THE 

2980
02:20:26,484 --> 02:20:26,917
LAST FEW MONTHS. 

2981
02:20:26,917 --> 02:20:27,351
THEY WERE NOT EASY. 

2982
02:20:27,351 --> 02:20:31,189
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT SAYS ABOUT 

2983
02:20:31,189 --> 02:20:33,792
HIS TEMPERMENT AND ABILITY TO 

2984
02:20:33,792 --> 02:20:35,493
STAY OPTIMISTIC DESPITE IT ALL? 

2985
02:20:35,493 --> 02:20:37,695
>>  ISN'T THAT SOMETHING? 

2986
02:20:37,695 --> 02:20:40,698
IT'S A GREAT LESSON FOR LIFE 

2987
02:20:40,698 --> 02:20:42,066
FOR ALL OF US. 

2988
02:20:42,066 --> 02:20:43,201
HE DID NOT IMMERSE HIMSELF IN 

2989
02:20:43,201 --> 02:20:45,570
THE BAD LUCK OF WHAT HE WAS 

2990
02:20:45,570 --> 02:20:45,803
FACING. 

2991
02:20:45,803 --> 02:20:46,904
I LOVE THE WORDS. 

2992
02:20:46,904 --> 02:20:51,576
HE TOOK TIME TO THINK THIS 

2993
02:20:51,576 --> 02:20:52,009
THROUGH OBVIOUSLY. 

2994
02:20:52,009 --> 02:20:53,077
HE LEFT US WITH THESE WONDERFUL 

2995
02:20:53,077 --> 02:20:56,080
THOUGHTS OF THE LAST WEEKS OF 

2996
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:56,481
HIS LIFE. 

2997
02:20:56,481 --> 02:21:04,923
THAT WAS ONE OF THEM THAT HE 

2998
02:21:04,923 --> 02:21:05,456
DOESN'T REGRET ANYTHING. 

2999
02:21:05,456 --> 02:21:10,328
TEDDY ROOSEVELT USED TO SAY TO 

3000
02:21:10,328 --> 02:21:12,430
HIS KIDS LIFE IS GLORIOUS AND 

3001
02:21:12,430 --> 02:21:14,332
HERE IS JOHN McCAIN WITH THE 

3002
02:21:14,332 --> 02:21:14,765
SAME THING. 

3003
02:21:14,765 --> 02:21:16,835
>>  HE HAD SO MUCH INFLUENCE 

3004
02:21:16,835 --> 02:21:18,636
AND INPUT OVER HOW THIS FUNERAL 

3005
02:21:18,636 --> 02:21:19,169
WOULD BE. 

3006
02:21:19,169 --> 02:21:23,708
THE MEMORIAL SERVICES, FIVE 

3007
02:21:23,708 --> 02:21:24,308
DAYS OF HONORING HIM. 

3008
02:21:24,308 --> 02:21:27,412
WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS IMPORTANT 

3009
02:21:27,412 --> 02:21:28,245
FOR HIM TO CONVEY? 

3010
02:21:28,245 --> 02:21:30,348
>>  ISN'T THAT AMAZING TO SEE 

3011
02:21:30,348 --> 02:21:32,717
WHAT WE ARE WATCHING AND 

3012
02:21:32,717 --> 02:21:32,984
HEARING. 

3013
02:21:32,984 --> 02:21:33,317
HE PLANNED. 

3014
02:21:33,317 --> 02:21:35,253
HE IS TALKING TO US THE MESSAGE 

3015
02:21:35,253 --> 02:21:37,956
THAT HE WANTED AND OF COURSE 

3016
02:21:37,956 --> 02:21:40,658
THE BATTLE NOW IS FOR HIS 

3017
02:21:40,658 --> 02:21:46,030
LEGACY AND THAT'S KIND OF LIKE 

3018
02:21:46,030 --> 02:21:46,831
A SLAM DUNK. 

3019
02:21:46,831 --> 02:21:48,365
HE IS STILL SPEAKING TO US 

3020
02:21:48,365 --> 02:21:51,603
THROUGH THE GRAVE AND THROUGH 

3021
02:21:51,603 --> 02:21:54,104
THESE EVENTS HE HAS PLANNED. 

3022
02:21:54,104 --> 02:21:57,742
HE HAS DUB IT WELL. 

3023
02:21:57,742 --> 02:21:58,509
HE HAS DONE IT WELL. 

3024
02:21:58,509 --> 02:22:00,912
>>  WE HAVE A LIVE LOOK OF THE 

3025
02:22:00,912 --> 02:22:04,716
HEARSE AND YOU SEE THE 

3026
02:22:04,716 --> 02:22:05,016
MOTORCADE. 

3027
02:22:05,016 --> 02:22:07,018
THE POLICE TRAVELING WITH THE 

3028
02:22:07,018 --> 02:22:08,453
BODY AS IT'LL MAKE ITS WAY TO 

3029
02:22:08,453 --> 02:22:10,655
THE AIRPORT AND HEAD OVER TO 

3030
02:22:10,655 --> 02:22:11,022
WASHINGTON DC. 

3031
02:22:11,022 --> 02:22:13,958
YOU CAN TELL US WHY THE SENATOR 

3032
02:22:13,958 --> 02:22:16,661
DECIDED TO BE BURIED AT THE 

3033
02:22:16,661 --> 02:22:19,063
NAVAL ACADEMY INSTEAD OF 

3034
02:22:19,063 --> 02:22:19,363
ARLINGTON? 

3035
02:22:19,363 --> 02:22:19,630
>>  YEAH. 

3036
02:22:19,630 --> 02:22:22,667
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY BUT I KNOW 

3037
02:22:22,667 --> 02:22:24,369
HOW HE LOVED THE MILITARY AND 

3038
02:22:24,369 --> 02:22:28,406
THE NAVY AND I MENTIONED 

3039
02:22:28,406 --> 02:22:30,341
EARLIER HOW I WAS BACKSTAGE 

3040
02:22:30,341 --> 02:22:31,342
WITH HIM WHEN THEY STARTED 

3041
02:22:31,342 --> 02:22:34,145
PLAYING THE ANTHEMS AND HE 

3042
02:22:34,145 --> 02:22:36,114
STOOD UP LIKE A 9-YEAR-OLD 

3043
02:22:36,114 --> 02:22:37,849
CHILD AND MARCHED AROUND THE 

3044
02:22:37,849 --> 02:22:40,318
LITTLE TRAILER BACKSTAGE WHERE 

3045
02:22:40,318 --> 02:22:40,651
WE WERE. 

3046
02:22:40,651 --> 02:22:43,388
THE SPEAKERS WERE AND IT WAS 

3047
02:22:43,388 --> 02:22:44,656
VERY MUCH INTO IT. 

3048
02:22:44,656 --> 02:22:47,358
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HIS FATHER 

3049
02:22:47,358 --> 02:22:48,960
WAS AN ADMIRALS HIS GRANDFATHER 

3050
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,394
WAS, THAT WAS THE TRADITION. 

3051
02:22:50,394 --> 02:22:51,629
HE GREW UP IN THAT. 

3052
02:22:51,629 --> 02:22:53,765
THAT WAS STEEPED IN HIM. 

3053
02:22:53,765 --> 02:22:54,698
I KNEW YOUR FATHER. 

3054
02:22:54,698 --> 02:22:55,666
I KNEW YOUR GRANDFATHER. 

3055
02:22:55,666 --> 02:22:57,869
HE WAS A HERO AND HE WAS 

3056
02:22:57,869 --> 02:22:59,470
HEARING ALL OF THESE STORIES. 

3057
02:22:59,470 --> 02:23:02,540
NOW HEAR HE COMES BACK HOME 

3058
02:23:02,540 --> 02:23:05,643
REALLY TO NO LONGER IN THE 

3059
02:23:05,643 --> 02:23:06,644
SHADOWS, NOW A GREAT FIGURE OF 

3060
02:23:06,644 --> 02:23:09,347
HISTORY AND AS YOU KNOW THEY 

3061
02:23:09,347 --> 02:23:12,050
ARE TALKING ABOUT NAMING ONE OF 

3062
02:23:12,050 --> 02:23:13,651
THE BUILDINGS AFTER HIM. 

3063
02:23:13,651 --> 02:23:14,084
THAT'S SOMETHING. 

3064
02:23:14,084 --> 02:23:15,787
THERE ARE ONLY FOUR OUR FIVE 

3065
02:23:15,787 --> 02:23:18,056
SENATORS WHO COULD GET THAT. 

3066
02:23:18,056 --> 02:23:19,490
THAT'S AN AMAZING MOMENT FOR US 

3067
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:21,859
TO SEE HIS -- THE PASSING OF A 

3068
02:23:21,859 --> 02:23:22,159
GREAT MAN. 

3069
02:23:22,159 --> 02:23:26,965
>>  AND JUST HOW ACROSS THE 

3070
02:23:26,965 --> 02:23:28,232
AISLE HOW LOVED. 

3071
02:23:28,232 --> 02:23:29,867
WE SHOULD NOTE THERE ARE 24 

3072
02:23:29,867 --> 02:23:30,768
CURRENT OR PAST SENATORS WHO 

3073
02:23:30,768 --> 02:23:33,371
ACTUALLY MADE THE TRIP OUT TO 

3074
02:23:33,371 --> 02:23:36,974
ARIZONA TO HONOR AND REMEMBER 

3075
02:23:36,974 --> 02:23:37,842
HIM. 

3076
02:23:37,842 --> 02:23:38,876
ONE OF THEM, JOE BIDEN. 

3077
02:23:38,876 --> 02:23:40,044
HE STARTS OFF. 

3078
02:23:40,044 --> 02:23:41,579
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY. 

3079
02:23:41,579 --> 02:23:43,481
HE SAID MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN, 

3080
02:23:43,481 --> 02:23:48,286
I'M A DEMOCRAT AND I LOVE JOHN 

3081
02:23:48,286 --> 02:23:48,519
McCAIN. 

3082
02:23:48,519 --> 02:23:49,387
>>  YEAH.

3083
02:23:49,387 --> 02:23:49,720
THAT'S RIGHT. 

3084
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:51,089
THIS IS -- BIPARTISAN. 

3085
02:23:51,089 --> 02:23:53,024
IT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

3086
02:23:53,024 --> 02:23:56,227
LONG FOR AND WOULD LOVE TO SEE 

3087
02:23:56,227 --> 02:23:59,397
AND YET IT'S SUCH A BITTER 

3088
02:23:59,397 --> 02:23:59,597
TIME. 

3089
02:23:59,597 --> 02:24:02,800
IT TAKES UNUSUAL PEOPLE TO 

3090
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:05,103
REACH ACROSS THE AISLE AND TO 

3091
02:24:05,103 --> 02:24:05,503
CLOSE THAT GULF. 

3092
02:24:05,503 --> 02:24:05,937
IT'S INTERESTING. 

3093
02:24:05,937 --> 02:24:07,571
WHEN YOU GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES 

3094
02:24:07,571 --> 02:24:10,675
AND YOU LOOK BACK ON AMERICA WE 

3095
02:24:10,675 --> 02:24:12,777
ARE SO MUCH ALIKE COMPARED TO 

3096
02:24:12,777 --> 02:24:15,580
POLITICAL PARTIES IN OTHER 

3097
02:24:15,580 --> 02:24:16,814
COUNTRIES THAT REALLY DEBATE 

3098
02:24:16,814 --> 02:24:17,114
OPPOSITES. 

3099
02:24:17,114 --> 02:24:18,983
YOU GET HOME AND IT'S JUST LIKE 

3100
02:24:18,983 --> 02:24:20,818
COUSINS OR A FIGHT WITH IN THE 

3101
02:24:20,818 --> 02:24:21,052
FAMILY. 

3102
02:24:21,052 --> 02:24:23,421
IT CAN BE SO BITTER, THE CLOSER 

3103
02:24:23,421 --> 02:24:26,157
WE ARE THE MORE BITTER 

3104
02:24:26,157 --> 02:24:28,292
SOMETIMES THE FIGHT CAN BE. 

3105
02:24:28,292 --> 02:24:32,029
THIS TIME OF MOURNING, OF JOHN 

3106
02:24:32,029 --> 02:24:33,431
McCAIN CERTAINLY GIVES US THE 

3107
02:24:33,431 --> 02:24:34,666
FEELING OF HOW WONDERFUL IT 

3108
02:24:34,666 --> 02:24:36,534
WOULD BE IF WE COULD WORK 

3109
02:24:36,534 --> 02:24:37,301
TOGETHER ONCE AGAIN. 

3110
02:24:37,301 --> 02:24:38,735
>>  HE WASN'T ALSO AFRAID TO 

3111
02:24:38,735 --> 02:24:40,805
SORT OF STAND UP EVEN IF IT 

3112
02:24:40,805 --> 02:24:43,107
MEANT WITH IN HIS OWN PARTY. 

3113
02:24:43,107 --> 02:24:44,976
I REMEMBER BACK TO THE IRAQ WAR 

3114
02:24:44,976 --> 02:24:49,180
WITH PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH IF 

3115
02:24:49,180 --> 02:24:51,115
IT WAS TORTURE, THE WAR, HE 

3116
02:24:51,115 --> 02:24:52,817
WASN'T AFRAID TO HOLD THE 

3117
02:24:52,817 --> 02:24:53,684
ADMINISTRATION RESPONSIBLE NO 

3118
02:24:53,684 --> 02:24:54,051
MATTER WHAT. 

3119
02:24:54,051 --> 02:24:56,721
WHY -- HE WAS A VOICE THAT 

3120
02:24:56,721 --> 02:24:58,022
PEOPLE REALLY HELD IN HIGH 

3121
02:24:58,022 --> 02:24:59,957
REGARD BECAUSE OF HIS TIME 

3122
02:24:59,957 --> 02:25:01,225
OVERSEAS AND AS A POW. 

3123
02:25:01,225 --> 02:25:03,227
WHY DID YOU THINK IT IS WHEN 

3124
02:25:03,227 --> 02:25:05,997
YOU TALK OF WAR AND HIS TIME ON 

3125
02:25:05,997 --> 02:25:06,564
THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES 

3126
02:25:06,564 --> 02:25:06,864
COMMITTEE. 

3127
02:25:06,864 --> 02:25:09,033
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT HE 

3128
02:25:09,033 --> 02:25:11,169
WANTS PEOPLE TO REMEMBER ABOUT 

3129
02:25:11,169 --> 02:25:15,706
LIFE ABROAD SERVING YOUR  

3130
02:25:15,706 --> 02:25:15,973
COUNTRY? 

3131
02:25:15,973 --> 02:25:16,507
>>  YEAH. 

3132
02:25:16,507 --> 02:25:17,709
WELL, AGAIN HANOI HILTON SHAPED 

3133
02:25:17,709 --> 02:25:20,611
HIS LIFE AND AMONG OTHER THINGS 

3134
02:25:20,611 --> 02:25:23,314
TOOK THE FEAR AWAY. 

3135
02:25:23,314 --> 02:25:24,415
LINCOLN TALKED ABOUT THAT. 

3136
02:25:24,415 --> 02:25:26,117
LINCOLN AFTER THE LOSS OF HIS 

3137
02:25:26,117 --> 02:25:28,052
SON -- HE TOLD HIS LAW PARTNER 

3138
02:25:28,052 --> 02:25:28,853
I CAN'T GO HOME. 

3139
02:25:28,853 --> 02:25:33,858
EVERY ROOM I GO INTO I SEE MY 

3140
02:25:33,858 --> 02:25:35,359
LITTLE BOY AND HE WENT INTO 

3141
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:40,264
PUBLIC LIFE TO BE ALONE, TO 

3142
02:25:40,264 --> 02:25:40,831
ESCAPE HOME AND MARY WHO 

3143
02:25:40,831 --> 02:25:43,434
REMINDED HIM OF THE LOSS HE 

3144
02:25:43,434 --> 02:25:43,634
HAD. 

3145
02:25:43,634 --> 02:25:45,503
HE WENT INTO PUBLIC LIFE ALL 

3146
02:25:45,503 --> 02:25:46,637
THESE PEOPLE TO BE ALONE. 

3147
02:25:46,637 --> 02:25:49,640
I THINK A PART OF JOHN McCAIN, 

3148
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:51,809
HE SUFFERED SO MUCH IN THAT WAR 

3149
02:25:51,809 --> 02:25:53,911
IT WAS LIKE -- WHAT MORE CAN 

3150
02:25:53,911 --> 02:25:54,144
HAPPEN? 

3151
02:25:54,144 --> 02:25:57,548
HE SAW HOW BAD IT CAN GET AND 

3152
02:25:57,548 --> 02:26:00,618
THAT'S WHAT MADE LIFE AND 

3153
02:26:00,618 --> 02:26:01,218
LIVING GLORIOUS FOR HIM AND 

3154
02:26:01,218 --> 02:26:02,753
WHAT HELPED HIM DO WHAT YOU 

3155
02:26:02,753 --> 02:26:05,756
SAID, TO SPEAK UP ON SOME OF 

3156
02:26:05,756 --> 02:26:06,657
THESE ISSUES, WHAT CAN HAPPEN 

3157
02:26:06,657 --> 02:26:08,759
TO ME ANY WORSE THAN WHAT I 

3158
02:26:08,759 --> 02:26:09,493
HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED? 

3159
02:26:09,493 --> 02:26:11,729
>>  WE ARE WATCHING THE HEARSE 

3160
02:26:11,729 --> 02:26:15,566
MAKE ITS WAY IN TO THE AIRPORT 

3161
02:26:15,566 --> 02:26:16,868
AND TRAVEL ONTO WASHINGTON DC. 

3162
02:26:16,868 --> 02:26:18,002
WATCHING THAT BEAUTIFUL 

3163
02:26:18,002 --> 02:26:19,337
CEREMONY AT NORTH PHOENIX 

3164
02:26:19,337 --> 02:26:19,704
BAPTIST CHURCH. 

3165
02:26:19,704 --> 02:26:21,339
I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT JOHN 

3166
02:26:21,339 --> 02:26:21,806
McCAIN'S OWN FAITH. 

3167
02:26:21,806 --> 02:26:23,140
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT IT? 

3168
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:25,042
>>  WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT HE 

3169
02:26:25,042 --> 02:26:27,845
HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF THIS 

3170
02:26:27,845 --> 02:26:28,779
CHURCH FOR MANY YEARS. 

3171
02:26:28,779 --> 02:26:30,181
FOR MUCH OF HIS LIFE. 

3172
02:26:30,181 --> 02:26:33,851
SO, AND YOU CAN TELL BY THE 

3173
02:26:33,851 --> 02:26:37,088
CHOICE OF THE SPEAKERS AND THE 

3174
02:26:37,088 --> 02:26:37,621
SCRIPTURES THAT HE USED. 

3175
02:26:37,621 --> 02:26:40,291
IT WAS A PERSONAL AND PRIVATE 

3176
02:26:40,291 --> 02:26:40,992
PART OF HIS LIFE. 

3177
02:26:40,992 --> 02:26:45,897
HE UNDERSTOOD AND KNEW, I HAD A 

3178
02:26:45,897 --> 02:26:49,300
CONVERSATION WITH HIM ABOUT THE 

3179
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:50,601
ANTIPATHY IN THE MEDIA TOWARD 

3180
02:26:50,601 --> 02:26:52,570
PEOPLE OF FAITH AND HE DIDN'T 

3181
02:26:52,570 --> 02:26:54,372
CARRY THAT ON HIS SLEEVE FOR 

3182
02:26:54,372 --> 02:26:57,575
HIS OWN POLITICAL PURPOSES AND 

3183
02:26:57,575 --> 02:26:58,075
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER. 

3184
02:26:58,075 --> 02:26:59,844
YOU CAN SEE WHEN YOU FACE 

3185
02:26:59,844 --> 02:27:03,681
ISSUES OF LIFE AND DEATH PEOPLE 

3186
02:27:03,681 --> 02:27:06,984
HAVE THESE VERY DEEPLY HELD 

3187
02:27:06,984 --> 02:27:09,120
POSITIONS AND BELIEFS AND IDEAS 

3188
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:11,389
AND HERE THEY ARE ON FULL 

3189
02:27:11,389 --> 02:27:11,656
DISPLAY. 

3190
02:27:11,656 --> 02:27:19,430
HE IS EMBRACING HIS FAITH FOR 

3191
02:27:19,430 --> 02:27:23,767
HIS FAMILY IN THIS CEREMONY. 

3192
02:27:23,767 --> 02:27:26,570
>>  I WAS READING ABOUT HIS 

3193
02:27:26,570 --> 02:27:30,575
LIFE AND ONE OF HIS FRIENDS, 

3194
02:27:30,575 --> 02:27:31,676
TOMMY ESPINOZA TELLS THIS GREAT 

3195
02:27:31,676 --> 02:27:34,679
STORY ABOUT WHEN McCAIN ASKED 

3196
02:27:34,679 --> 02:27:35,512
HIM TO BE HIS GODFATHER. 

3197
02:27:35,512 --> 02:27:37,582
TOMMY SAID YOU KNOW I'M A 

3198
02:27:37,582 --> 02:27:41,218
CATHOLIC, I'M NOT BAPTIST AND 

3199
02:27:41,218 --> 02:27:42,452
McCAIN SAID THAT'S OKAY. 

3200
02:27:42,452 --> 02:27:45,956
OKAY I WILL BE THE GOOD FATHER. 

3201
02:27:45,956 --> 02:27:46,490
HE INCLUDED EVERYBODY. 

3202
02:27:46,490 --> 02:27:47,358
IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT THE 

3203
02:27:47,358 --> 02:27:49,693
FUNERAL BUT ABOUT HIS LIFE. 

3204
02:27:49,693 --> 02:27:50,828
>>  YEAH. 

3205
02:27:50,828 --> 02:27:54,532
THAT HAPPENS OFTEN TO  

3206
02:27:54,532 --> 02:27:54,865
POLITICIANS. 

3207
02:27:54,865 --> 02:27:59,570
THEY -- THEY CRITICIZE SOME OF 

3208
02:27:59,570 --> 02:28:00,705
THESE POLITICIANS, HARING WITH 

3209
02:28:00,705 --> 02:28:02,773
HIS CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH 

3210
02:28:02,773 --> 02:28:03,708
CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS AND THEY 

3211
02:28:03,708 --> 02:28:06,210
CRITICIZE THEM BECAUSE THEY 

3212
02:28:06,210 --> 02:28:07,178
FEEL THEY DON'T REMAIN ORTHODOX 

3213
02:28:07,178 --> 02:28:07,611
TO THEIR FAITH. 

3214
02:28:07,611 --> 02:28:08,879
BY THE TIME YOU ARE ELECTED 

3215
02:28:08,879 --> 02:28:10,381
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

3216
02:28:10,381 --> 02:28:12,016
OR YOU HAVE A PUBLIC CAREER 

3217
02:28:12,016 --> 02:28:15,519
LIKE JOHN McCAIN YOU HAVE 

3218
02:28:15,519 --> 02:28:17,455
RUBBED SHOULDERS WITH PEOPLE 

3219
02:28:17,455 --> 02:28:19,590
FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT POCKETS 

3220
02:28:19,590 --> 02:28:22,226
THAT YOU KIND OF DEVELOP YOUR 

3221
02:28:22,226 --> 02:28:24,395
OWN VERSION OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE 

3222
02:28:24,395 --> 02:28:25,595
AND WHY YOU BELIEVE IT. 

3223
02:28:25,595 --> 02:28:29,567
IT HAS TO BE MORE INCLUDING 

3224
02:28:29,567 --> 02:28:30,901
THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD BE. 

3225
02:28:30,901 --> 02:28:33,204
IT'S GREAT WHEN YOU LIVE IN THE 

3226
02:28:33,204 --> 02:28:34,438
PROVINCE AND YOU CAN BELIEVE 

3227
02:28:34,438 --> 02:28:36,207
WHAT YOU WHAT YOU BELIEVE UNTIL 

3228
02:28:36,207 --> 02:28:36,907
THE MOMENT YOU DIE. 

3229
02:28:36,907 --> 02:28:39,510
YOU GET OUT IN THE PUBLIC LIFE 

3230
02:28:39,510 --> 02:28:41,912
AND YOU MEET PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE 

3231
02:28:41,912 --> 02:28:43,214
THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY 

3232
02:28:43,214 --> 02:28:45,116
AND YOU DEVELOP A TOLERANCE YOU 

3233
02:28:45,116 --> 02:28:45,649
WOULDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE. 

3234
02:28:45,649 --> 02:28:46,950
>>  ALSO IN THE PUBLIC LIGHT 

3235
02:28:46,950 --> 02:28:49,553
THIS WEEK THE STATE OF ARIZONA. 

3236
02:28:49,553 --> 02:28:50,454
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT HE 

3237
02:28:50,454 --> 02:28:52,656
WAS ONCE LABELED WHEN HE RAN 

3238
02:28:52,656 --> 02:28:54,292
FOR SENATOR A CARPET BAGGER 

3239
02:28:54,292 --> 02:28:58,262
BECAUSE HE WASN'T FROM ARIZONA 

3240
02:28:58,262 --> 02:28:58,562
ORIGINALLY. 

3241
02:28:58,562 --> 02:28:59,429
HARD TO IMAGINE. 

3242
02:28:59,429 --> 02:29:03,501
>>  NOW HE EMBRACES ARIZONA AND 

3243
02:29:03,501 --> 02:29:03,968
ARIZONA EMBRACES HIM. 

3244
02:29:03,968 --> 02:29:05,870
THAT HARKENS BACK TO THE 

3245
02:29:05,870 --> 02:29:06,370
KEATING FIVE THING. 

3246
02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:07,904
IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT HE 

3247
02:29:07,904 --> 02:29:10,041
EXPERIENCED IN LIFE AND IT'S A 

3248
02:29:10,041 --> 02:29:12,243
LESSON I KEEP TEACHING MY 

3249
02:29:12,243 --> 02:29:13,277
CHILDREN AND MY GRANDCHILDREN. 

3250
02:29:13,277 --> 02:29:14,945
NONE OF THESE SET BACKS, NONE 

3251
02:29:14,945 --> 02:29:16,446
OF THESE HURTS, NONE OF THESE 

3252
02:29:16,446 --> 02:29:21,786
ACCUSATIONS, NONE OF THESE 

3253
02:29:21,786 --> 02:29:22,519
CRITICISMS ARE FATAL. 

3254
02:29:22,519 --> 02:29:23,120
DEATH IS FATAL. 

3255
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:24,288
ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN COME BACK 

3256
02:29:24,288 --> 02:29:26,790
FROM AND HE DID THAT. 

3257
02:29:26,790 --> 02:29:28,259
HE BECAME THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT 

3258
02:29:28,259 --> 02:29:31,796
HAD HAPPENED TO HIM IN THE 

3259
02:29:31,796 --> 02:29:33,764
KEATING FIVE AND HE WIPED OUT 

3260
02:29:33,764 --> 02:29:36,400
ALL CONCERNS ABOUT IF HE WAS A 

3261
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:38,869
TRUE ARIZONA RESIDENT OR NOT. 

3262
02:29:38,869 --> 02:29:41,539
MOST ARIZONA RESIDENTS WERE NOT 

3263
02:29:41,539 --> 02:29:43,140
BORN IN ARIZONA. 

3264
02:29:43,140 --> 02:29:44,241
>>  THAT'S A GOOD POINT. 

3265
02:29:44,241 --> 02:29:46,343
I WANT TO YOU CAN ABOUT THE 

3266
02:29:46,343 --> 02:29:46,844
NEXT FEW DAYS. 

3267
02:29:46,844 --> 02:29:49,447
WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA 

3268
02:29:49,447 --> 02:29:52,149
AND PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH 

3269
02:29:52,149 --> 02:29:52,749
WILL SPEAK IN WASHINGTON. 

3270
02:29:52,749 --> 02:29:54,385
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT AND 

3271
02:29:54,385 --> 02:29:56,287
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE TWO 

3272
02:29:56,287 --> 02:29:57,588
FORMER PRESIDENTS WHO HE ONCE 

3273
02:29:57,588 --> 02:29:58,889
FACED OFF WITH FOR THE HIGHEST 

3274
02:29:58,889 --> 02:29:59,190
OFFICE? 

3275
02:29:59,190 --> 02:30:00,791
>>  I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 

3276
02:30:00,791 --> 02:30:04,995
WHAT THEY ARE PLANNING TO SAY 

3277
02:30:04,995 --> 02:30:05,962
OR DO. 

3278
02:30:05,962 --> 02:30:07,998
I KNOW. 

3279
02:30:07,998 --> 02:30:08,331
RELATIONSHIP? 

3280
02:30:08,331 --> 02:30:09,966
>>  WE KNOW HOW DEEPLY BITTER 

3281
02:30:09,966 --> 02:30:11,869
THE RELATIONSHIP WAS WITH 

3282
02:30:11,869 --> 02:30:13,671
GEORGE W BUSH BUT HE HAS AN 

3283
02:30:13,671 --> 02:30:15,973
ABILITY TO FOR GIVEN AND JOHN 

3284
02:30:15,973 --> 02:30:18,075
McCAIN AS I SAID EARLIER HAS AN 

3285
02:30:18,075 --> 02:30:20,978
ABILITY TO FORGIVE AND OFTEN 

3286
02:30:20,978 --> 02:30:21,178
DID. 

3287
02:30:21,178 --> 02:30:22,680
HE WOULD LOOSE HIS TEMPER, BE 

3288
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:26,183
MAD AND REGRET IT, WOE GO BACK 

3289
02:30:26,183 --> 02:30:30,988
AND BEG FOR FORGIVENESS. 

3290
02:30:30,988 --> 02:30:32,390
IT WAS HIS PERSONALITY AND 

3291
02:30:32,390 --> 02:30:35,092
OBAMA, WHAT -- IT MUST MELT 

3292
02:30:35,092 --> 02:30:36,694
OBAMA'S HEART EVERY TIME HE 

3293
02:30:36,694 --> 02:30:37,995
SEES THAT VIDEO WHERE McCAIN IS 

3294
02:30:37,995 --> 02:30:41,765
STANDING UP FOR HIM AS A FAMILY 

3295
02:30:41,765 --> 02:30:41,999
 

3296
02:30:41,999 --> 02:30:44,502
McCAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT 

3297
02:30:44,502 --> 02:30:44,902
BITTER CAMPAIGN. 

3298
02:30:44,902 --> 02:30:46,670
HE HAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS 

3299
02:30:46,670 --> 02:30:49,473
IS A MOMENT OF HISTORY AND 

3300
02:30:49,473 --> 02:30:50,374
AFRICAN AMERICAN THAT COULD BE 

3301
02:30:50,374 --> 02:30:52,176
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

3302
02:30:52,176 --> 02:30:52,877
STATES. 

3303
02:30:52,877 --> 02:30:54,278
>>  ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE 

3304
02:30:54,278 --> 02:30:55,846
MOMENT WHERE SOMEONE SAID HE IS 

3305
02:30:55,846 --> 02:30:59,383
ARAB AND HE SAID NO, HE IS A 

3306
02:30:59,383 --> 02:30:59,583
MAN. 

3307
02:30:59,583 --> 02:31:01,018
>>  THAT'S WHAT WE SAID. 

3308
02:31:01,018 --> 02:31:05,756
IS HE A GOOD MAN AND A FAMILY 

3309
02:31:05,756 --> 02:31:05,956
MAN. 

3310
02:31:05,956 --> 02:31:06,924
IT'S SO INTERESTING THAT OBAMA 

3311
02:31:06,924 --> 02:31:08,526
WAS SUCH A FAMILY MAN WHETHER 

3312
02:31:08,526 --> 02:31:10,427
YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT OR 

3313
02:31:10,427 --> 02:31:10,727
REPUBLICAN. 

3314
02:31:10,727 --> 02:31:12,429
McCAIN HAD TO SAY THIS IS A MAN 

3315
02:31:12,429 --> 02:31:14,832
WHO HAS BEEN GOOD TO HIS WIFE 

3316
02:31:14,832 --> 02:31:16,801
AND GOODTO HIS CHILDREN AND 

3317
02:31:16,801 --> 02:31:19,603
HAD THE NICE COMBINATION A LOT 

3318
02:31:19,603 --> 02:31:20,504
OF PRESIDENTS SPOIL THEIR 

3319
02:31:20,504 --> 02:31:22,907
CHILDREN BUT THERE WAS A NICE 

3320
02:31:22,907 --> 02:31:24,575
MIX OF LOVE AND DISCIPLINE ON 

3321
02:31:24,575 --> 02:31:27,611
THE McCAIN -- ON THE OBAMA 

3322
02:31:27,611 --> 02:31:28,379
FAMILY AND McCAIN RECOGNIZED 

3323
02:31:28,379 --> 02:31:30,981
THAT AND GAVE CREDIT WHERE IT 

3324
02:31:30,981 --> 02:31:31,482
WAS DUE. 

3325
02:31:31,482 --> 02:31:33,484
>>  WE ARE WATCHING AGAIN THE 

3326
02:31:33,484 --> 02:31:34,551
BODY OF JOHN McCAIN HEADING 

3327
02:31:34,551 --> 02:31:36,820
TOWARD THE AIRPORT AS HE WILL 

3328
02:31:36,820 --> 02:31:39,356
HEAD TO WASHINGTON DC AND BE 

3329
02:31:39,356 --> 02:31:41,258
HONORED BY HIS COLLEAGUES ON 

3330
02:31:41,258 --> 02:31:43,727
CAPITOL HILL AS WELL AS FORMER 

3331
02:31:43,727 --> 02:31:44,294
PRESIDENTS'S WE MENTIONED. 

3332
02:31:44,294 --> 02:31:46,530
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LIFE AND 

3333
02:31:46,530 --> 02:31:48,298
THE LEGACY OF JOHN McCAIN WE 

3334
02:31:48,298 --> 02:31:50,600
TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT HOW HE 

3335
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:50,834
LIVED. 

3336
02:31:50,834 --> 02:31:52,503
I JUST THINK IT'S FASCINATING 

3337
02:31:52,503 --> 02:31:54,505
ALSO HOW HE CHOSE TO DIE. 

3338
02:31:54,505 --> 02:31:58,008
PLANNING OUT HIS FUNERAL IN THE 

3339
02:31:58,008 --> 02:32:00,211
COMFORT OF HIS HOME STATE AND 

3340
02:32:00,211 --> 02:32:01,344
ALSO REALLY PUTTING IN THE 

3341
02:32:01,344 --> 02:32:02,546
SPOTLIGHT BRAIN CANCER. 

3342
02:32:02,546 --> 02:32:03,914
I HAVE BEEN READING A GREAT 

3343
02:32:03,914 --> 02:32:05,116
DEAL ABOUT BRAIN CANCER AND HOW 

3344
02:32:05,116 --> 02:32:06,317
IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR HIM TO 

3345
02:32:06,317 --> 02:32:10,387
SHRINE A LIGHT ON THAT AS WELL. 

3346
02:32:10,387 --> 02:32:14,858
>>  WHAT HAPPENED TO BEAU AND 

3347
02:32:14,858 --> 02:32:15,792
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH BIDEN. 

3348
02:32:15,792 --> 02:32:16,460
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS HOW 

3349
02:32:16,460 --> 02:32:18,295
QUICKLY THIS HAPPENED ONCE HE 

3350
02:32:18,295 --> 02:32:19,363
WENT OFF THE MEDICATION. 

3351
02:32:19,363 --> 02:32:22,766
IT'S ALMOST LIKE TURNING OFF 

3352
02:32:22,766 --> 02:32:23,367
THE LIGHT SWITCH. 

3353
02:32:23,367 --> 02:32:25,069
LIKE I GOT EVERYTHING SET AND 

3354
02:32:25,069 --> 02:32:26,903
DONE AND NOW HERE WE GO. 

3355
02:32:26,903 --> 02:32:28,239
IT'S LIKE EVERY OTHER PART OF 

3356
02:32:28,239 --> 02:32:31,475
HIS LIFE SEEMED LIKE HE WAS IN 

3357
02:32:31,475 --> 02:32:32,442
CONTROL THERE TOO. 

3358
02:32:32,442 --> 02:32:32,943
>>  YEAH. 

3359
02:32:32,943 --> 02:32:35,346
IT'S JUST HARD TO IGNORE AT THE 

3360
02:32:35,346 --> 02:32:37,648
END OF THAT MEMORIAL SERVICE 

3361
02:32:37,648 --> 02:32:39,216
HOW FRANK SINATRA PLAYED 

3362
02:32:39,216 --> 02:32:43,119
THROUGH THE CROWD AT THE END MY 

3363
02:32:43,119 --> 02:32:43,320
WAY. 

3364
02:32:43,320 --> 02:32:47,191
>>  I DID IT MY WAY. 

3365
02:32:47,191 --> 02:32:49,793
I HAVE LIVED THAT LIFE, YEAH. 

3366
02:32:49,793 --> 02:32:50,127
NO ACCIDENT. 

3367
02:32:50,127 --> 02:32:51,295
MAKES ME CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT 

3368
02:32:51,295 --> 02:32:53,497
MORE WILL UNFOLD AS WE 

3369
02:32:53,497 --> 02:32:54,864
CELEBRATE HIS LIFE ON SATURDAY. 

3370
02:32:54,864 --> 02:32:55,366
>>  YEAH. 

3371
02:32:55,366 --> 02:32:58,569
YOU KNOW WE TALKED SO MUCH 

3372
02:32:58,569 --> 02:33:00,137
ABOUT HIS LEGACY BUT IS THERE 

3373
02:33:00,137 --> 02:33:03,474
SOMEONE RIGHT NOW ON CAPITOL 

3374
02:33:03,474 --> 02:33:05,442
HILL OR POSSIBLY ENTERING 

3375
02:33:05,442 --> 02:33:07,378
CAPTAIN HILL WHO COULD BE A 

3376
02:33:07,378 --> 02:33:07,845
FUTURE JOHN McCAIN? 

3377
02:33:07,845 --> 02:33:10,547
>>  THERE MUST BE BUT I DON'T 

3378
02:33:10,547 --> 02:33:11,482
KNOW WHO IT IS. 

3379
02:33:11,482 --> 02:33:14,084
RIGHT NOW I MEAN NAMING A 

3380
02:33:14,084 --> 02:33:15,986
BUILDING AFTER HIM, POSSIBLY 

3381
02:33:15,986 --> 02:33:17,288
WHICH THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT 

3382
02:33:17,288 --> 02:33:21,392
AND A NAMING A BUILDING THAT'S 

3383
02:33:21,392 --> 02:33:22,993
NAMED AFTER A DEMOCRAT SENATOR 

3384
02:33:22,993 --> 02:33:24,328
-- A REPUBLICAN SENATOR, THAT'S 

3385
02:33:24,328 --> 02:33:25,161
A BIT UNUSUAL. 

3386
02:33:25,161 --> 02:33:27,498
YOU HAVE TO PUT HIM IN THE 

3387
02:33:27,498 --> 02:33:30,301
CATEGORY WITH DANIEL WEBSTER 

3388
02:33:30,301 --> 02:33:32,603
AND WITH HENRY CLAY AND WITH 

3389
02:33:32,603 --> 02:33:37,174
EVER RECEIPT DIRKSON AND BOY I 

3390
02:33:37,174 --> 02:33:37,908
MISS HIM, AND ROBERT TAFT. 

3391
02:33:37,908 --> 02:33:41,679
HE HAS TO BE AMONG A HANDFUL OF 

3392
02:33:41,679 --> 02:33:43,147
THE GREATIST SENATORS IN 

3393
02:33:43,147 --> 02:33:45,983
AMERICAN HISTORY AND IT'S GOING 

3394
02:33:45,983 --> 02:33:47,251
TO BE HARD FOR SOMEONE 

3395
02:33:47,251 --> 02:33:47,818
OVERNIGHT TO MATCH THAT. 

3396
02:33:47,818 --> 02:33:50,020
>>  CERTAINLY WILL BE NO MATTER 

3397
02:33:50,020 --> 02:33:50,220
WHAT. 

3398
02:33:50,220 --> 02:33:52,022
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS? 

3399
02:33:52,022 --> 02:33:53,123
YOU HAVE HAD TIME TO INTERVIEW 

3400
02:33:53,123 --> 02:33:54,825
AND SIT DOWN WITH HIM AND MEET 

3401
02:33:54,825 --> 02:33:55,225
WITH HIM. 

3402
02:33:55,225 --> 02:34:00,531
WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU ABOUT 

3403
02:34:00,531 --> 02:34:00,864
JOHN McCAIN? 

3404
02:34:00,864 --> 02:34:03,066
>>  YOU KNOW ITS INTERESTING. 

3405
02:34:03,066 --> 02:34:03,934
I HAVE INTERVIEWED SIX 

3406
02:34:03,934 --> 02:34:05,636
PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED 

3407
02:34:05,636 --> 02:34:06,370
STATES. 

3408
02:34:06,370 --> 02:34:08,238
SOME OF THEM MANY, MANY HOURS. 

3409
02:34:08,238 --> 02:34:10,307
WHAT SURPRISES ME THE MOST 

3410
02:34:10,307 --> 02:34:15,846
ABOUT JOHN McCAIN IS HIS SENSE 

3411
02:34:15,846 --> 02:34:17,380
OF HUMOR AND HIS SARCASM. 

3412
02:34:17,380 --> 02:34:19,116
HE JUST DIDN'T TAKE HIMSELF OR 

3413
02:34:19,116 --> 02:34:20,517
LIFE OR THE ISSUES THAT 

3414
02:34:20,517 --> 02:34:21,451
SERIOUSLY. 

3415
02:34:21,451 --> 02:34:24,054
HE COULD TALK TO THE ISSUES BUT 

3416
02:34:24,054 --> 02:34:26,056
THERE WOULD BE THIS SLY GRIN ON 

3417
02:34:26,056 --> 02:34:29,760
HIS FACE AND HE WOULD COME UP 

3418
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:32,963
WITH SOME HUMOR IN IT SOMEWHERE 

3419
02:34:32,963 --> 02:34:34,365
AND I LOVED THAT ABOUT HIM AND 

3420
02:34:34,365 --> 02:34:36,066
THAT SETTINGS HIM APART FROM 

3421
02:34:36,066 --> 02:34:38,369
MANY OF THE OTHER VERY SERIOUS 

3422
02:34:38,369 --> 02:34:41,505
PEOPLE THAT I INTERVIEWED WHO 

3423
02:34:41,505 --> 02:34:42,606
TAKE THEMSELVES AND TAKE LIFE 

3424
02:34:42,606 --> 02:34:43,507
VERY SERIOUSLY. 

3425
02:34:43,507 --> 02:34:45,709
>>  A LONG WAY ESPECIALLY IN 

3426
02:34:45,709 --> 02:34:47,111
POLITICS WON'T IT? 

3427
02:34:47,111 --> 02:34:47,544
>>  THAT'S RIGHT. 

3428
02:34:47,544 --> 02:34:47,845
ABSOLUTELY. 

3429
02:34:47,845 --> 02:34:48,278
YOU NEED IT. 

3430
02:34:48,278 --> 02:34:51,582
>>  YOU DEFINITELY NEED IT 

3431
02:34:51,582 --> 02:34:52,148
WITHOUT A DOUBT. 

3432
02:34:52,148 --> 02:34:53,617
AS WE ARE WATCHING THIS -- THE 

3433
02:34:53,617 --> 02:34:55,986
BODY OF JOHN McCAIN AND HIS 

3434
02:34:55,986 --> 02:34:57,755
CASKE, T WILL ARRIVE HERE AT 

3435
02:34:57,755 --> 02:34:58,956
THE AIRPORT AND BE TAKEN ON 

3436
02:34:58,956 --> 02:35:01,759
BOARD THIS PLANE YOU ARE SEEING 

3437
02:35:01,759 --> 02:35:02,660
HERE TO WASHINGTON DC. 

3438
02:35:02,660 --> 02:35:03,961
IN FACT IT'LL HEAD FIRST TO 

3439
02:35:03,961 --> 02:35:06,663
JOINT BASE ANDREWS AND THEN 

3440
02:35:06,663 --> 02:35:09,466
MAKING ITS WAY EVENTUALLY TO 

3441
02:35:09,466 --> 02:35:09,999
THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL. 

3442
02:35:09,999 --> 02:35:12,369
AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 

3443
02:35:12,369 --> 02:35:13,203
LIFE AND LEGACY. 

3444
02:35:13,203 --> 02:35:14,538
WHAT I DIDN'T SAY EARLIER -- WE 

3445
02:35:14,538 --> 02:35:15,639
COULDN'T SEE THE SHOT. 

3446
02:35:15,639 --> 02:35:17,041
THERE WERE ABOUT A THOUSAND 

3447
02:35:17,041 --> 02:35:18,475
PEOPLE WHO CHOSE TO GATHER 

3448
02:35:18,475 --> 02:35:20,277
OUTSIDE OF THIS CHURCH WHO WERE 

3449
02:35:20,277 --> 02:35:21,645
ALLOWED -- THE PUBLIC ALLOWED 

3450
02:35:21,645 --> 02:35:23,580
TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS. 

3451
02:35:23,580 --> 02:35:25,649
I SHOULD SAY THEY BRAVED ALMOST 

3452
02:35:25,649 --> 02:35:27,985
100-DEGREE TEMPERATURES TO 

3453
02:35:27,985 --> 02:35:29,386
STAND OUTSIDE FOR HOURS. 

3454
02:35:29,386 --> 02:35:30,453
THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED IN. 

3455
02:35:30,453 --> 02:35:33,390
THE CAPACITY AT THE CHURCH WAS 

3456
02:35:33,390 --> 02:35:35,525
2,000 ONLY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE 

3457
02:35:35,525 --> 02:35:38,295
WITH THIS LEVEL OF SECURITY AND 

3458
02:35:38,295 --> 02:35:38,595
VIP. 

3459
02:35:38,595 --> 02:35:40,998
A THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED 

3460
02:35:40,998 --> 02:35:42,599
TO GATHER OUTSIDE AND IN THE 

3461
02:35:42,599 --> 02:35:45,502
HEAT TO SAY GOOD-BYE AND PAY 

3462
02:35:45,502 --> 02:35:45,869
THEIR RESPECTS. 

3463
02:35:45,869 --> 02:35:46,970
WHAT DOES IT MAP FOR PEOPLE IN 

3464
02:35:46,970 --> 02:35:49,473
ARIZONA WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A 

3465
02:35:49,473 --> 02:35:51,475
MAN WHO SERVED 35 YEARS 

3466
02:35:51,475 --> 02:35:52,475
REPRESENTING THE STATE? 

3467
02:35:52,475 --> 02:35:52,742
>>  YEAH.

3468
02:35:52,742 --> 02:35:56,747
AND YOU KNOW -- MOST OF THE 

3469
02:35:56,747 --> 02:35:58,582
PEOPLE IN ARIZONA ARE IN 

3470
02:35:58,582 --> 02:35:59,082
CALIFORNIA THIS MONTH. 

3471
02:35:59,082 --> 02:36:00,450
>>  THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S SO HOT. 

3472
02:36:00,450 --> 02:36:02,452
>>  IT'S VERY, VERY HOT. 

3473
02:36:02,452 --> 02:36:04,888
I WAS SO SURPRISED BY THE 

3474
02:36:04,888 --> 02:36:06,390
NUMBERS BUT I HAVE TALKED TO 

3475
02:36:06,390 --> 02:36:08,025
MANY OF MY FRIENDS IN ARIZONA 

3476
02:36:08,025 --> 02:36:09,593
AND ASKED THEM THAT SAME 

3477
02:36:09,593 --> 02:36:11,695
QUESTION AND BEEN AMAZED AT 

3478
02:36:11,695 --> 02:36:13,931
FRIENDS WHO -- I WOULDN'T USE 

3479
02:36:13,931 --> 02:36:16,400
THE WORD HATE BUT HAD GREAT 

3480
02:36:16,400 --> 02:36:17,301
ANGER TOWARD JOHN McCAIN 

3481
02:36:17,301 --> 02:36:19,603
BECAUSE IT WAS A HIGH WIRE ACT 

3482
02:36:19,603 --> 02:36:22,372
FOR HIM TO APPEAL TO THE MEDIA 

3483
02:36:22,372 --> 02:36:24,374
AND TO APPEAL TO DEMOCRATS AND 

3484
02:36:24,374 --> 02:36:25,976
BUILD HIS CAREER DOING THAT 

3485
02:36:25,976 --> 02:36:28,278
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE 

3486
02:36:28,278 --> 02:36:29,780
REPRESENTING THIS VERY -- AT 

3487
02:36:29,780 --> 02:36:30,981
THE TIME CONSERVATIVE STATE IN 

3488
02:36:30,981 --> 02:36:32,883
ARIZONA AND TO DO THAT AND GET 

3489
02:36:32,883 --> 02:36:34,384
AWAY WITH IT YOU SEE THE 

3490
02:36:34,384 --> 02:36:35,319
POLITICAL CAREER OF JEFF FLAKE 

3491
02:36:35,319 --> 02:36:37,054
AND YOU GET AN IDEA OF HOW HARD 

3492
02:36:37,054 --> 02:36:41,625
IT IS TO PULL THAT OFF.  

3493
02:36:47,764 --> 02:36:49,933
IT'S USUALLY BASED ON WHAT THEY 

3494
02:36:49,933 --> 02:36:51,300
TOLD YOU ABOUT EARLIER. 

3495
02:36:51,300 --> 02:36:53,203
HIS ABILITY OR HIS DESIRE TO 

3496
02:36:53,203 --> 02:36:55,004
SEEK FORGIVENESS WHEN HE WOULD 

3497
02:36:55,004 --> 02:36:58,475
MAKE A MISTAKE OR SAY IT THE 

3498
02:36:58,475 --> 02:36:58,875
WRONG WAY. 

3499
02:36:58,875 --> 02:37:00,444
HE WOULD SEEK OUT THAT PERSON 

3500
02:37:00,444 --> 02:37:02,478
AND SAY THAT WAS WRONG OF ME. 

3501
02:37:02,478 --> 02:37:03,514
I'M SORRY. 

3502
02:37:03,514 --> 02:37:04,480
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME? 

3503
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:06,383
THAT IS SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL 

3504
02:37:06,383 --> 02:37:06,883
IN POLITICS. 

3505
02:37:06,883 --> 02:37:08,485
>>  VERY UNUSUAL. 

3506
02:37:08,485 --> 02:37:08,785
I'M SORRY. 

3507
02:37:08,785 --> 02:37:10,053
IT IS THE HARDEST WORD FOR SO 

3508
02:37:10,053 --> 02:37:11,622
MANY OF US TO SAY. 

3509
02:37:11,622 --> 02:37:13,757
I WANT TO ASK YOU DID YOU EVER 

3510
02:37:13,757 --> 02:37:17,160
GET A CHANCE TO INTERVIEW HIS 

3511
02:37:17,160 --> 02:37:20,263
-- WHO IS NOW 106, HIS MOTHER? 

3512
02:37:20,263 --> 02:37:20,631
>>  NO. 

3513
02:37:20,631 --> 02:37:22,132
I NEVER DID. 

3514
02:37:22,132 --> 02:37:28,839
>>  I'M JUST FASCINATED BY 

3515
02:37:28,839 --> 02:37:30,040
SEEING HER. 

3516
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:30,240
106. 

3517
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:30,574
>>  AMAZING. 

3518
02:37:30,574 --> 02:37:32,409
>>  SHE WILL I BELIEVE BE 

3519
02:37:32,409 --> 02:37:34,611
ATTENDING THE SERVICE AT THE 

3520
02:37:34,611 --> 02:37:36,446
NATIONAL CATHETRAL AT THE DC 

3521
02:37:36,446 --> 02:37:38,615
AND THE BURIAL THAT WILL HAPPEN 

3522
02:37:38,615 --> 02:37:40,350
AT THE UNITED STATES NAVAL 

3523
02:37:40,350 --> 02:37:41,784
ACADEMY ON SUNDAY. 

3524
02:37:41,784 --> 02:37:44,288
JOE BIDEN, I THINK IT WAS 

3525
02:37:44,288 --> 02:37:46,056
POIGNANT TALKED ABOUT HOW 

3526
02:37:46,056 --> 02:37:48,091
NOBODY SHOULD BE AROUND TO BURY 

3527
02:37:48,091 --> 02:37:48,558
THEIR OWN CHILD. 

3528
02:37:48,558 --> 02:37:48,959
>>  YEAH. 

3529
02:37:48,959 --> 02:37:50,661
>>  OF COURSE HIS OWN SON 

3530
02:37:50,661 --> 02:37:51,461
PASSING. 

3531
02:37:51,461 --> 02:37:52,763
>>  TWO I SHOULD SAY. 

3532
02:37:52,763 --> 02:37:54,765
>>  WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS 

3533
02:37:54,765 --> 02:37:58,468
SO MANY MANY OF THESE GREAT MEN 

3534
02:37:58,468 --> 02:38:03,240
AND PRESIDENTS AND CANDIDATES 

3535
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:05,242
ARE MOMMA'S BOYS AND THEY HAVE 

3536
02:38:05,242 --> 02:38:06,276
AN ABSENT FATHER. 

3537
02:38:06,276 --> 02:38:09,446
THAT WAS TRUE OF GEORGE W BUSH. 

3538
02:38:09,446 --> 02:38:10,948
THEY SAID TO GEORGE HW BUSH I 

3539
02:38:10,948 --> 02:38:12,449
BET YOU ARE PROUD OF HIM. 

3540
02:38:12,449 --> 02:38:15,586
HOW DID YOU RAISE HIM AND HE 

3541
02:38:15,586 --> 02:38:16,319
SAID I WASN'T THERE. 

3542
02:38:16,319 --> 02:38:17,988
BARBARA RAISED HIM AND OBAMA'S 

3543
02:38:17,988 --> 02:38:18,621
FATHER WAS ABSENT. 

3544
02:38:18,621 --> 02:38:20,591
IT'S THE SAME STORY OFFER AND 

3545
02:38:20,591 --> 02:38:23,293
OVER STARTING GEORGE WASHINGTON 

3546
02:38:23,293 --> 02:38:25,061
ALL THE WAY THROUGH HISTORY. 

3547
02:38:25,061 --> 02:38:26,496
DEFINITELY WITH JOHN McCAIN 

3548
02:38:26,496 --> 02:38:26,797
TOO. 

3549
02:38:26,797 --> 02:38:29,900
AN ABSENT FATHER BUT A VERY 

3550
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:31,602
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH A 

3551
02:38:31,602 --> 02:38:31,835
MOTHER. 

3552
02:38:31,835 --> 02:38:34,271
>>  WE ARE WATCHING THE HEARSE 

3553
02:38:34,271 --> 02:38:38,475
PULL IN TO THE AIRPORT HERE IN 

3554
02:38:38,475 --> 02:38:38,875
ARIZONA, PHOENIX. 

3555
02:38:38,875 --> 02:38:40,010
YOU KNOW I WAS ALSO STRUCK 

3556
02:38:40,010 --> 02:38:41,612
ABOUT DURING THIS MEMORIAL 

3557
02:38:41,612 --> 02:38:43,280
SERVICE ABOUT THE ATTENTION HE 

3558
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:47,884
ALSO HAD A FLUTIST FROM THE 

3559
02:38:47,884 --> 02:38:48,317
NAVAJO COMMUNITY. 

3560
02:38:48,317 --> 02:38:50,320
HOW HE WANTED THIS TO NOT JUST 

3561
02:38:50,320 --> 02:38:51,421
BE DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, 

3562
02:38:51,421 --> 02:38:53,223
INCLUDING THE CULTURE THERE AS 

3563
02:38:53,223 --> 02:38:54,324
WELL. 

3564
02:38:54,324 --> 02:38:54,591
>>  YEAH. 

3565
02:38:54,591 --> 02:38:55,993
HE IS SHOWING OFF ARIZONA. 

3566
02:38:55,993 --> 02:38:58,128
>>  HE DID LOVE THAT STATE. 

3567
02:38:58,128 --> 02:39:01,732
>>  SUCH A DIVERSE STATE AND 

3568
02:39:01,732 --> 02:39:02,032
THAT MUSIC. 

3569
02:39:02,032 --> 02:39:03,667
THERE WERE MOMENTS THAT HE WAS 

3570
02:39:03,667 --> 02:39:06,503
MOVED IN LIFE AND HE WANTED US 

3571
02:39:06,503 --> 02:39:09,406
TO FEEL THEM AND -- TO HEAR 

3572
02:39:09,406 --> 02:39:12,376
THEM AND SEE THEM SO EVERYTHING 

3573
02:39:12,376 --> 02:39:14,611
WAS THERE IN THIS CELEBRATION 

3574
02:39:14,611 --> 02:39:16,213
AND USUALLY WHEN SOMETHING LIKE 

3575
02:39:16,213 --> 02:39:17,514
THIS HAPPENS YOU THINK, IF THEY 

3576
02:39:17,514 --> 02:39:20,017
COULD ONLY BA LIVE TO SEE THIS 

3577
02:39:20,017 --> 02:39:20,917
THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE 

3578
02:39:20,917 --> 02:39:21,852
SURPRISED. 

3579
02:39:21,852 --> 02:39:26,490
I HAVE A FEELING THAT JOHN 

3580
02:39:26,490 --> 02:39:27,023
McCAIN IS NOT SURPRISED. 

3581
02:39:27,023 --> 02:39:27,557
>>  ABSOLUTELY. 

3582
02:39:27,557 --> 02:39:30,427
>>  HIS DIRECTING OF EVENTS 

3583
02:39:30,427 --> 02:39:32,295
BEYOND THE GRAVE. 

3584
02:39:32,295 --> 02:39:33,363
>>  ABSOLUTELY. 

3585
02:39:33,363 --> 02:39:35,065
THE CASKET HAS MADE A SIX MILE 

3586
02:39:35,065 --> 02:39:37,367
TRIP FROM INITIALLY THIS 

3587
02:39:37,367 --> 02:39:38,869

TODAY. 

3592
02:39:43,339 --> 02:39:45,242
THE MEMORIAL SERVICES I SHOULD 

3593
02:39:45,242 --> 02:39:47,477
SAY FOR THE LATE SENATOR. 

3594
02:39:47,477 --> 02:39:49,246

02:39:50,747 --> 02:39:51,948
STANDS OUT TO YOU? 

3597
02:39:51,948 --> 02:39:57,087
>>  I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH 

3598
02:39:57,087 --> 02:39:58,188
GRANT WOODS SPEECH THAT JUST 

3599
02:39:58,188 --> 02:39:58,488
STRUCK ME. 

3600
02:39:58,488 --> 02:39:59,589
>>  WHAT WAS IT? 

3601
02:39:59,589 --> 02:40:01,425
>>  SO WELL DONE. 

3602
02:40:01,425 --> 02:40:05,128
IT WAS JUST SO BALANCED. 

3603
02:40:05,128 --> 02:40:06,697
THE HUMOR AND HE JUST CAPTURED 

3604
02:40:06,697 --> 02:40:08,198
JOHN McCAIN SO WELL. 

3605
02:40:08,198 --> 02:40:10,600
I THOUGHT IT WAS SUCHA AN HONOR 

3606
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:15,472
THAT HE WOULD SPEND THE TIME 

3607
02:40:15,472 --> 02:40:17,174
AND THOUGHT THE ATTORNEY 

3608
02:40:17,174 --> 02:40:18,775
GENERAL TO DELIVER SUCH A GREAT 

3609
02:40:18,775 --> 02:40:20,277
AND WONDERFUL TESTIMONY TO HIM. 

3610
02:40:20,277 --> 02:40:23,080
I WAS DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THAT. 

3611
02:40:23,080 --> 02:40:24,748
>>  YOU KNOW IT SAYS SOMETHING 

3612
02:40:24,748 --> 02:40:26,382
TOO THAT SO MANY FORMER FOLKS 

3613
02:40:26,382 --> 02:40:30,320
WHO WORKED ON HIS CAMPAIGN WHO 

3614
02:40:30,320 --> 02:40:32,689
ADVISED HIM HAVE BEEN SUCH AN 

3615
02:40:32,689 --> 02:40:34,691
IMPORTANT PART OF THE PUBLIC 

3616
02:40:34,691 --> 02:40:37,094
IMAGE OF JOHN McCAIN AND 

3617
02:40:37,094 --> 02:40:40,130
RETELLING THE STORIES OF HIM 

3618
02:40:40,130 --> 02:40:40,797
BEHIND THE SCENES. 

3619
02:40:40,797 --> 02:40:44,401
>>  I'M SURPRISED BY THAT. 

3620
02:40:44,401 --> 02:40:46,470
I'M SURPRISED MOSTLY BY THE 

3621
02:40:46,470 --> 02:40:48,271
PEOPLE WHO OPPOSED HIM AND 

3622
02:40:48,271 --> 02:40:50,073
WRITE ALL OF THESE HATEFUL 

3623
02:40:50,073 --> 02:40:51,975
THINGS AND COMMENTS ON YOUTUBE 

3624
02:40:51,975 --> 02:40:53,076
AND TWEETS. 

3625
02:40:53,076 --> 02:40:55,311
I HAVE TALKED TO SOME OF THOSE 

3626
02:40:55,311 --> 02:40:57,247
PEOPLE AND THEY WILL BE THE 

3627
02:40:57,247 --> 02:41:00,183
FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE 

3628
02:41:00,183 --> 02:41:01,685
WAS A GREAT SENATOR AND THEY 

3629
02:41:01,685 --> 02:41:04,321
RESPECT HIM FOR WHAT HE 

3630
02:41:04,321 --> 02:41:06,423
ACCOMPLISHED WHAT HE DID AND 

3631
02:41:06,423 --> 02:41:07,324
WHO HE WAS. 

3632
02:41:07,324 --> 02:41:09,426
>>  ONE TIME FORMER UNITED 

3633
02:41:09,426 --> 02:41:10,059
STATES NAVY PILOT. 

3634
02:41:10,059 --> 02:41:13,697
HEN TOURED FIVE AND A HALF 

3635
02:41:13,697 --> 02:41:17,801
YEARS AS A POW IN VIETNAM. 

3636
02:41:17,801 --> 02:41:21,972
VERY CELEBRATED CAREER ON 

3637
02:41:21,972 --> 02:41:22,305
CAPITOL HILL. 

3638
02:41:22,305 --> 02:41:23,673
THE STATE OF ARIZONA SAYS GOOD-

3639
02:41:23,673 --> 02:41:26,176
BYE TO HIM AS HIS BODY WILL 

3640
02:41:26,176 --> 02:41:32,783
HEAD TO WASHINGTON DC TO THE 

3641
02:41:32,783 --> 02:41:33,183
NATION'S CAPITOL. 

3642
02:41:33,183 --> 02:41:35,819
>>> MISSING, THE FORMER 

3643
02:41:35,819 --> 02:41:40,023
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE'S FORMER 

3644
02:41:40,023 --> 02:41:41,658
RUNNING MATE, SARAH PALIN. 

3645
02:41:41,658 --> 02:41:42,125
WHY IS THAT? 

3646
02:41:42,125 --> 02:41:43,593
WHAT WAS THEIR REP LIKE AFTER 

3647
02:41:43,593 --> 02:41:43,893
THAT RUN? 

3648
02:41:43,893 --> 02:41:48,031
>>  THAT'S A VERY COMPLICATED 

3649
02:41:48,031 --> 02:41:51,601
STORY BUT JOHN McCAIN WAS NOT A 

3650
02:41:51,601 --> 02:41:52,535
PERFECT POLITICIAN. 

3651
02:41:52,535 --> 02:41:56,073
HE WENT LATE INTO THAT CAMPAIGN 

3652
02:41:56,073 --> 02:41:57,707
WITHOUT SECURING HIS CHRISTIAN 

3653
02:41:57,707 --> 02:41:57,907
BASE. 

3654
02:41:57,907 --> 02:41:58,575
YOU CAN SEE HE ATTENDED A 

3655
02:41:58,575 --> 02:42:00,743
CHURCH AND WAS A MEMBER OF IT 

3656
02:42:00,743 --> 02:42:02,679
FOR MANY YEARS, HAD MET WITH 

3657
02:42:02,679 --> 02:42:05,182
SOME OF THE LEADERS BUT HE 

3658
02:42:05,182 --> 02:42:07,784
WAITED TOO LATE TO SECURE HIS 

3659
02:42:07,784 --> 02:42:08,318
BASE. 

3660
02:42:08,318 --> 02:42:11,521
OBAMA WHO IS A FANTASTIC 

3661
02:42:11,521 --> 02:42:12,021
POLITICIAN, SPOTTED IT. 

3662
02:42:12,021 --> 02:42:13,523
HE LAUNCHED WHAT WAS CALLED 

3663
02:42:13,523 --> 02:42:14,891
OPERATION JOSHUA THAT WENT OVER 

3664
02:42:14,891 --> 02:42:18,128
THE HEADS OF THE NATIONAL 

3665
02:42:18,128 --> 02:42:18,428
IMMEDIATEY. 

3666
02:42:18,428 --> 02:42:21,231
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT HE 

3667
02:42:21,231 --> 02:42:22,098
WAS RAIDING McCAIN'S CHRISTIAN 

3668
02:42:22,098 --> 02:42:25,235
BASE, WHITE VOTERS AND THE 

3669
02:42:25,235 --> 02:42:26,369
McCAIN CAMPAIGN PANICKED. 

3670
02:42:26,369 --> 02:42:27,604
THEY TRIED A FEW THINGS THAT 

3671
02:42:27,604 --> 02:42:29,806
BACK FIRED THE PASTOR FROM OHIO 

3672
02:42:29,806 --> 02:42:31,575
AND TEXAS, GOT THEM IN WORSE 

3673
02:42:31,575 --> 02:42:33,176
TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY WERE 

3674
02:42:33,176 --> 02:42:34,878
STARTING TOO LATE AND SARAH 

3675
02:42:34,878 --> 02:42:36,446
PALIN WAS THE PERFECT MISSING 

3676
02:42:36,446 --> 02:42:38,582
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THAT SOLVED 

3677
02:42:38,582 --> 02:42:38,882
IT. 

3678
02:42:38,882 --> 02:42:40,684
THERE WAS ABOUT A WEEK WHERE 

3679
02:42:40,684 --> 02:42:42,419
THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN WAS STUNNED 

3680
02:42:42,419 --> 02:42:45,255
LIKE A DEER CAUGHT IN 

3681
02:42:45,255 --> 02:42:46,757
HEADLIGHTS WHERE THEY THOUGHT 

3682
02:42:46,757 --> 02:42:57,133
OH NO, HE OF HE FIGURED IT OUT 

3683
02:42:57,133 --> 02:42:57,900
BUT SARAH PALIN IMPLODED. 

3684
02:42:57,900 --> 02:42:59,603
SHE WASN'T PREPARED AND I THINK 

3685
02:42:59,603 --> 02:43:01,404
THIS WAS -- BY NOT INVITING HER 

3686
02:43:01,404 --> 02:43:03,607
TO THE FUNERAL I THINK THIS WAS 

3687
02:43:03,607 --> 02:43:06,109
THE TIP TO THE NATIONAL MEDIA 

3688
02:43:06,109 --> 02:43:07,477
ALL HIS LIFE. 

3689
02:43:07,477 --> 02:43:09,980
HE LEANED TOWARD THEM ON EVENTS 

3690
02:43:09,980 --> 02:43:12,382
AND ON DECISIONS ABOUT TRUMP, 

3691
02:43:12,382 --> 02:43:13,616
EVEN THE SAME THING. 

3692
02:43:13,616 --> 02:43:15,852
I THINK THIS WAS HIM SAYING 

3693
02:43:15,852 --> 02:43:21,858
THAT Y I KNOW I MADE A MISTAKE 

3694
02:43:21,858 --> 02:43:23,960
WITH LETTER AND IT -- IT IS 

3695
02:43:23,960 --> 02:43:25,128
WHAT IT IS. 

3696
02:43:25,128 --> 02:43:26,996
HE LOST THAT CAMPAIGN. 

3697
02:43:26,996 --> 02:43:29,432
IT WAS A CLOSE CAMPAIGN BUT 

3698
02:43:29,432 --> 02:43:32,435
PALIN SOLVED IT BRIEFLY BUT SHE 

3699
02:43:32,435 --> 02:43:33,069
WASN'T QUITE READY. 

3700
02:43:33,069 --> 02:43:34,905
>>  SO MUCH OF THESE NEXT FEW 

3701
02:43:34,905 --> 02:43:36,506
DAYS IN THE MEMORIAL IN 

3702
02:43:36,506 --> 02:43:38,308
WASHINGTON DC WILL HAVE TO DO 

3703
02:43:38,308 --> 02:43:40,811
ALSO ABOUT WHAT WE DID NOT LIKE 

3704
02:43:40,811 --> 02:43:41,211
ABOUT POLITICS. 

3705
02:43:41,211 --> 02:43:42,279
WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT, 

3706
02:43:42,279 --> 02:43:43,914
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NOT BE 

3707
02:43:43,914 --> 02:43:45,015
INVITED, WHAT WAS THE MESSAGE 

3708
02:43:45,015 --> 02:43:45,916
YOU THINK JOHN McCAIN WAS 

3709
02:43:45,916 --> 02:43:48,051
TRYING TO SAY WITH THAT? 

3710
02:43:48,051 --> 02:43:52,555
>>  I THINK THAT'S OBVIOUS, 

3711
02:43:52,555 --> 02:43:56,059
AGAIN, HE -- THEY GOT INTO A 

3712
02:43:56,059 --> 02:43:56,292
FIGHT. 

3713
02:43:56,292 --> 02:43:58,662
IN FAIRNESS IT'S NOT OFTEN 

3714
02:43:58,662 --> 02:44:00,964
COVERED, JOHN McCAIN SHOT OFF 

3715
02:44:00,964 --> 02:44:01,264
FIRST. 

3716
02:44:01,264 --> 02:44:04,600
HE SAID THEY ARE CRAZIES. 

3717
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:05,068
HE WAS EMBARRASSED. 

3718
02:44:05,068 --> 02:44:07,570
HERE WERE 10,000 PEOPLE THAT 

3719
02:44:07,570 --> 02:44:08,705
SHOWED UP TO GREET TRUMP. 

3720
02:44:08,705 --> 02:44:11,241
THEY SHOWED UP AT THE 

3721
02:44:11,241 --> 02:44:12,309
CONVENTION CENTER IN PHOENIX. 

3722
02:44:12,309 --> 02:44:14,044
THIS BIG CROWD AND McCAIN WAS 

3723
02:44:14,044 --> 02:44:16,813
PULLING 200 PEOPLE AT HIS TOWN 

3724
02:44:16,813 --> 02:44:19,549
HALL MEETING AND HERE THIS 

3725
02:44:19,549 --> 02:44:21,151
OUTSIDER TRUMP PULLED 10,000 

3726
02:44:21,151 --> 02:44:21,384
PEOPLE. 

3727
02:44:21,384 --> 02:44:22,752
HE CALLED THEM CRAZIES BUT THEY 

3728
02:44:22,752 --> 02:44:26,456
WERE PEOPLE FROM HIS OWN STATE 

3729
02:44:26,456 --> 02:44:26,823
OF ARIZONA. 

3730
02:44:26,823 --> 02:44:27,457
TRUMP FIRED BACK. 

3731
02:44:27,457 --> 02:44:29,059
I LIKE MY HEROES THAT WEREN'T 

3732
02:44:29,059 --> 02:44:35,365
CAPTURED AND SO HERE WENT THIS 

3733
02:44:35,365 --> 02:44:36,599
PUBLIC, OPEN FIGHT EMBARRASSING 

3734
02:44:36,599 --> 02:44:38,668
FUED BETWEEN THE TWO AND McCAIN 

3735
02:44:38,668 --> 02:44:41,738
HAS EVER RIGHT TO DECIDE WHO HE 

3736
02:44:41,738 --> 02:44:45,008
WANTS TO HONOR AND WHY IN THIS 

3737
02:44:45,008 --> 02:44:46,843
CELEBRATION OF HIS OWN LIFE. 

3738
02:44:46,843 --> 02:44:49,045
I THINK HIS MESSAGE IS WE HAVE 

3739
02:44:49,045 --> 02:44:50,346
TO BE INCLUDING. 

3740
02:44:50,346 --> 02:44:53,149
WE HAVE TO GET ALONG TOGETHER 

3741
02:44:53,149 --> 02:44:54,917
AND -- NOBODY WILL BULLY ME. 

3742
02:44:54,917 --> 02:44:55,951
I THINK THAT'S HIS MESSAGE. 

3743
02:44:55,951 --> 02:44:57,354
>>  WE ARE SEEING THE LIVING 

3744
02:44:57,354 --> 02:44:59,389
IMAGES RIGHT NOW OF THE McCAIN 

3745
02:44:59,389 --> 02:45:01,691
FAMILY ON THE TARMAC THERE AS 

3746
02:45:01,691 --> 02:45:02,859
THE CASKET WILL BE REMOVE FROM 

3747
02:45:02,859 --> 02:45:04,260
THE CAR AND PLACED ON TO THE 

3748
02:45:04,260 --> 02:45:08,565
PLANE TO HEAD TO WASHINGTON DC. 

3749
02:45:08,565 --> 02:45:10,467
WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT MEGAN 

3750
02:45:10,467 --> 02:45:12,402
McCAIN GIVING A HUG TO HER 

3751
02:45:12,402 --> 02:45:13,770
SISTER BRIDGETT ON THE FAR 

3752
02:45:13,770 --> 02:45:14,037
LEFT. 

3753
02:45:14,037 --> 02:45:16,940
YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST SO HARD TO 

3754
02:45:16,940 --> 02:45:19,442
WATCH MEGAN McCAIN PLACING A 

3755
02:45:19,442 --> 02:45:20,376
KISS ON THE CASKET YESTERDAY AT 

3756
02:45:20,376 --> 02:45:23,146
THE STATE HOUSE WHEN THE BODY 

3757
02:45:23,146 --> 02:45:25,348
ARRIVED, JUST THE GRIEF OF JUST 

3758
02:45:25,348 --> 02:45:27,884
SO VISIBLE AND HARD TO IGNORE. 

3759
02:45:27,884 --> 02:45:29,486
>>  YEAH. 

3760
02:45:29,486 --> 02:45:32,489
I THINK MEGAN HAS DONE MORE FOR 

3761
02:45:32,489 --> 02:45:33,690
HER FATHER TO HUMANIZE HIM AND 

3762
02:45:33,690 --> 02:45:37,394
TO REMIND US THAT HE IS A DAD 

3763
02:45:37,394 --> 02:45:40,296
AND THAT SIDE OF HIM IN THE 

3764
02:45:40,296 --> 02:45:42,331
LAST FEW YEARS HER APTS ON TV, 

3765
02:45:42,331 --> 02:45:44,701
I THINK IT'S -- IT'S HAD A BIG 

3766
02:45:44,701 --> 02:45:46,469
IMPACT AND THAT IS OFTEN BEEN 

3767
02:45:46,469 --> 02:45:47,537
THE CASE. 

3768
02:45:47,537 --> 02:45:50,040
THAT'S THE CASE WITH JENNA BUSH 

3769
02:45:50,040 --> 02:45:52,242
TOO FOR GEORGE W BUSH. 

3770
02:45:52,242 --> 02:45:55,078
IT'S THE CASE OF IVANKA TRUMP 

3771
02:45:55,078 --> 02:46:00,050
WITH DONALD TRUMP FOR MANY 

3772
02:46:00,050 --> 02:46:00,350
PEOPLE. 

3773
02:46:00,350 --> 02:46:01,384
IT'S PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER 

3774

3775
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:05,221

3776
02:46:05,221 --> 02:46:09,893
WITH LINCOLN WHEN HE LOST 

3777
02:46:09,893 --> 02:46:10,193
WILLIE. 

3778
02:46:10,193 --> 02:46:13,196
AND HE AND HIS WIFE WERE 

3779
02:46:13,196 --> 02:46:15,398
TRANSFORMED AND LINCOLN COULD 

3780
02:46:15,398 --> 02:46:16,700
UNDERSTAND THE MANY FAMILIES 

3781
02:46:16,700 --> 02:46:18,401
WHO HAD EXPERIENCED SO MUCH 

3782
02:46:18,401 --> 02:46:20,303
LOSS DURING THE CIVIL WAR. 

3783
02:46:20,303 --> 02:46:22,872
ALL OF THAT WAS CHANGED BY THIS 

3784
02:46:22,872 --> 02:46:23,339
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. 

3785
02:46:23,339 --> 02:46:25,375

THINK THEIR CHILDREN WILL LOOK 

3954
03:04:09,538 --> 03:04:11,907
UP TO SENATOR McCAIN AND THAT 

3955
03:04:11,907 --> 03:04:13,509
THEY TAUGHT HIM -- THEM ALL SO 

3956
03:04:13,509 --> 03:04:16,311
MUCH ABOUT HOW TO BE A GOOD 

3957
03:04:16,311 --> 03:04:16,544
PERSON. 

3958
03:04:16,544 --> 03:04:17,613
SOME OF HIS CHILDREN ACTUALLY 

3959
03:04:17,613 --> 03:04:20,616
CAME OUT IN TO THE ROTU NDA 

3960
03:04:20,616 --> 03:04:22,117

3962
03:04:24,319 --> 03:04:24,986
STORIES ABOUT THEIR FATHER. 

3963
03:04:24,986 --> 03:04:25,687
WHAT TOUCHED THE CHILDREN IS 

3964
03:04:25,687 --> 03:04:27,623
THAT YOU COULD HEAR ON SOME OF 

3965
03:04:27,623 --> 03:04:29,157
THE AUDIO BECAUSE THERE WERE 

3966
03:04:29,157 --> 03:04:30,459
CAMERAS AROUND, WAS THAT THEY 

3967
03:04:30,459 --> 03:04:32,294
KEPT SAYING YOUR DAD WAS A 

3968
03:04:32,294 --> 03:04:32,594
GREAT MAN. 

3969
03:04:32,594 --> 03:04:33,762
THE CHILDREN WOULD SAY THANK 

3970
03:04:33,762 --> 03:04:34,229
YOU FOR COMING OUT. 

3971
03:04:34,229 --> 03:04:35,597
WE KNOW THAT IT'S VERY HOT AND 

3972
03:04:35,597 --> 03:04:37,866
THEY WOULD SAY OF COURSE WE 

3973
03:04:37,866 --> 03:04:39,768
WOULD DO THIS BECAUSE OF THE 

3974
03:04:39,768 --> 03:04:40,769
LEGACY OF YOUR FATHER. 

3975
03:04:40,769 --> 03:04:42,337
THAT THEY WERE JUST SO TOUCHED 

3976
03:04:42,337 --> 03:04:42,570
BY HIM. 

3977
03:04:42,570 --> 03:04:45,841
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I 

3978
03:04:45,841 --> 03:04:46,441
THINK THERE'S BEEN A 

3979
03:04:46,441 --> 03:04:46,741
OUTPOURING. 

3980
03:04:46,741 --> 03:04:47,476
SENATOR McCAIN WAS NOT BORN 

3981
03:04:47,476 --> 03:04:50,546

3982
03:04:50,546 --> 03:04:51,847

3984
03:04:54,183 --> 03:04:56,485
MEANT TO THE PEOPLE HERE. 

3985
03:04:56,485 --> 03:04:57,285

3988
03:05:00,089 --> 03:05:00,989

3993
03:05:07,362 --> 03:05:09,098

3996
03:05:12,367 --> 03:05:15,571
>>  HE UNDERSTOOD ALL OF US 

3997
03:05:15,571 --> 03:05:17,973
WHETHER IT WAS WHITE, BLACK, 

3998
03:05:17,973 --> 03:05:20,576
BROWN, ASIAN, TO HIM IT DIDN'T 

3999
03:05:20,576 --> 03:05:21,777
MAKE A DIFFERENCE. 

4000
03:05:21,777 --> 03:05:27,583
WHAT HE KNEW IS THAT WE ALL 

4001
03:05:27,583 --> 03:05:29,251

4002
03:05:29,251 --> 03:05:30,418
WE ALL MAKE AMERICA GREAT.
