you look at what's happening with
Lockheed we cut approximately 600
million dollars off the f-35 fighter and
there's only a mass 290 plane at a close
to 3,000
you

you
I appreciate Boeing for coming in and
competing and now they'll be competing
during the process for the rest of the
planes because there were thousands of
planes coming I appreciate Lockheed
Martin for being so responsive and that
will be appreciated very much
