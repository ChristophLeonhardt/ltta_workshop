actually nice good goats my pink sweater
love you too
my mommy
this morning I'm just asking the Lord
for wisdom how to move forward I have
like three different ways I could go I'm
juggling a few different occupations I'm
trying to figure out which one to put my
stock in one thing that I know that is
like my calling is about being a family
man being a husband and a father
it's like most important and that's the
thing that I feel like I guess men we
are rocks they're settling points well
what do you think you right there
all right and so we are the other rocks
for our wives we the foundation for our
children and the pillars in our
community and so as I'm kind of like
juggling you know which way to go is my
occupation I get a little unsettled
because I'm kind of one of those tools
for like a jack-of-all-trades so I've
been rapping for a while I'm kind of an
artist I draw write poetry I do these
videos you know I can speak and so as I
have all these different things to
juggle for me I put on your pants and
pee let me help you let me help you you
know pee on your brother
nah you can't pee on your brother man
come here oh you farted deal
I know pass gas right in my face no you
can't step on the Pete no come on
oh yeah so as I'm trying to figure out
my vocation and like which way to go
praying is something that me kind of the
first place I should go
prayer is the first place I should go
when I'm juggling these type of thoughts
but my first inclination is to give very
anxious and think to myself and then go
to my friends and then go to a family
and just ask a bunch of people who I
feel like should be able to help me but
I never go to God for some up here right
now spend some time with God in just fun
piece about like which way to heading so
my prayers like just for in asking him
it's not like whatever job I choose is
going to be something that won't give
him glory so I feel like God is it's
open-ended like I'm not sitting here
like god what should I do
I just want peace about my decision I
already know which way I'm leaning
but my heart is very anxious but I know
what I should do but when I get there I
don't want to be regretting it and
thinking about where else I could be I
just want to be focused you know I'm
saying thing that he wants me to do and
wants me to do only and he's gonna be
mad at me if I do something else I
cannot believe that I think God it's
like yo go wherever you want to go and
I'll be there with you you know
understand but when I mixed it when I
make this decision I just wanted to be
like certainly I haven't even brushed my
teeth or anything like that this morning
that's like my prayer that's what I'm
asking God right now to give me peace
upon my decision what is that another
