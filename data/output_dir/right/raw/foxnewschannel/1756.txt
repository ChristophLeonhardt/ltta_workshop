00:00:06,554 --> 00:00:07,188
UPSTREAM THIS SYSTEM.

00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:09,357

ISSUE OF THE NEW YORKER MAGAZINE

8
00:00:10,124 --> 00:00:12,126
IS RELEASED.

9
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:13,761
IT SHOWS PRESIDENT TRUMP TRYING

10
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:15,296
TO CHIP HIS WAY OUT OF A VERY

11
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:17,565
DEEP SWAMP THAT IS FULL OF

12
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:20,735
SNAKES AND INSIDE THE ISSUE THE

13
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:22,136
ARTICLE IS TITLED TRUMP VERSUS

HE WAS ON MSNBC EARLIER TODAY.

21
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,151
>> WHAT THIS PRESIDENT

22
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:38,586
UNDERSTANDS IS THAT HE'S GOING

23
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:39,621
TO TRY TO GET THINGS DONE

24
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:40,955
PERSONALLY AND EVENTUALLY HE'S

25
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:44,292
HAD TO TRY TO REORDER, RESHUFFLE

26
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:46,160
AND REALLY CHANGE THE NATURE OF

27
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,395
GOVERNANCE SO THAT THE VOICES

28
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:48,263

29
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:50,298

AND THAT DISSENT AND DEBATE WILL

31
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:53,735
BE SIDELINED.

00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:55,236

DAVID BOSSIE, TRUMP 2016 DEPUTY

00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:03,978
AUTHOR OF THE BOOK.

00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:05,013
CONTRIBUTOR'S.

40
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:06,814
GOOD TO SEE YOU, THANKS FOR

41
00:01:06,814 --> 00:01:07,749
BEING HERE.

42
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:08,483
DAVID, YOU HAVE WORKED CLOSELY

43
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:10,385
WITH THIS PRESIDENT.

44
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:12,754
IN THE WAY THAT THE AUTHOR

45
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:14,255
DESCRIBES LOYALISTS, AND WE HAVE

46
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:15,523
SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE JETTISON

47
00:01:15,523 --> 00:01:17,559
FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION, IS HE

48
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:18,960
RIGHT?

49
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,994
>> THIS PRESIDENT RAN ON

50
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:20,528
DRAINING THE SWAMP.

51
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:21,296
THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN TENETS

52
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:24,599
OF OUR CAMPAIGN, TO CHANGE

53
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,266
WASHINGTON AND HE'S TRULY AN

54
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,468
OUTSIDER AND A BELIEF IN HIS

55
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:30,338
SAID THERE ARE NEARLY 80,000

56
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:32,941
FEWER FEDERAL EMPLOYEES TODAY

57
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,309
THAN THERE WERE ONE

58
00:01:34,309 --> 00:01:35,043
PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME IN OFFICE

59
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:36,544
15 MONTHS AGO.

60
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:39,747
THAT IS AN UNBELIEVABLE --

61
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:40,481
>> Martha: THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN

62
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:42,350
AROUND TO FILLING SPOTS.

63
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,218
YOU ARE SAYING THEY HAVE NO

64
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:44,852
INTENTION OF FILLING THOSE

65
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:45,553
SPOTS?

66
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:46,354
>> THESE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING,

67
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:47,355
THEY ARE FLEEING THE SHIP

68
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:48,089
BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS ATTRACTIVE

69
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:50,224
AS IT ONCE WAS IN THE ECONOMY IS

70
00:01:50,224 --> 00:01:52,760
MUCH BETTER.

71
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,028
THIS PRESIDENT IS FOCUSED ON THE

72
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:54,596
DECONSTRUCTION OF THE

73
00:01:54,596 --> 00:01:56,965
ADMINISTRATIVE STATE.

74
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:57,899
THAT'S WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT

75
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,334
DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND THAT'S

76
00:01:59,334 --> 00:02:00,602
WHAT HE'S DOING TODAY.

77
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:02,804
>> Martha: AND DOES A LOT OF

78
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:03,371
PUSHBACK, OBVIOUSLY.

79
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:04,772
THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS ARE

80
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:05,473
REALLY LIKE LIVING IN THAT

81
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:07,542
ADMINISTRATIVE STATE.

82
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:09,776
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND SO

83
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:10,945
INTERESTING, JASON CHAFFETZ, IS

84
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:12,213
THE AREA IN AND AROUND

85
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:13,281
WASHINGTON, D.C., AS ONE OF THE

86
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:14,349
WEALTHIEST AREAS IN THE COUNTRY,

87
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,118
WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER, RIGHT?

88
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:18,019
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING FOR

89
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:19,354
THE GOVERNMENT WILL LIVE IN THAT

90
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:21,155
AREA AND IT HAS GROWN AND GROWN

91
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:22,557
AND GROWN AND GROWN AND GROWN

92
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:24,592
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES.

93
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:26,761
DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

94
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:27,428
HAVING ANY SUCCESS TRYING TO

95
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:31,966
TURN THE SWAMP?

96
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:33,034
>> THE PEOPLE IN THE DEEP STATE,

97
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:37,071
THEY DO NOT LIKE TRANSPARENCY.

98
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:39,340
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED ON

99
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,409
THE MAT AND WHEN THEY      A DIS

100
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:41,442
THE MAT AND WHEN THEY      A DIU

101
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:41,476
THE MAT AND WHEN THEY      A DIT

102
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:41,509
THE MAT AND WHEN THEY      A DIV

103
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,776
THE MAT AND WHEN THEY      A DIE

104
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:42,610
PERSONALITY LIKE DONALD TRUMP

105
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,745
AND HIS TEAM COME ALONG THEY

106
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:44,278
WANT TO FLEE.

107
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:45,480
THEY DON'T LIKE THE SUNSHINE,

108
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,948
THEY DON'T LIKE THAT.

109
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:49,784
I DO THINK HE'S MAKING PROGRESS.

110
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:50,652
BUT REMEMBER, WASHINGTON, D.C.,

111
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:51,719
IF YOU SPEND A MILLION DOLLARS A

112
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,355
DAY EVERY DAY IT WOULD TAKE YOU

113
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:55,390
ABOUT 3,000 YEARS TO GET TO

114
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,790
1 TRILLION.

115
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,326
THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS

116
00:02:58,326 --> 00:02:59,594
$4 TRILLION EVERY 12 MONTHS OF

117
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:00,328
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE GETTING

118
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:02,196
RICH ALONG THE WAY.

119
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:04,365
>> Martha: THE AUTHOR OF THIS

120
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:05,433
PIECE, DAVID, TALKS ABOUT WHAT

121
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:08,703
HE SEES AS THE POSITIVE THINGS

122
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:10,505
THAT GOVERNMENT CAN DO.

123
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:11,172
HE TALKS ABOUT PRESCRIPTION

124
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:14,976
DRUGS AND REGULATING ASPECTS OF

125
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:16,711
THE LIVES OF SENIOR CITIZENS,

126
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:17,445
MAKING SURE PEOPLE DON'T FALL

127
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:18,780
THROUGH THE CRACKS AND HE SEES

128
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,514
THIS AS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY

129
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:22,016
MUCH WORTH PROTECTING AND HE

130
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:22,717
SEES PRESIDENT TRUMP AS TRYING

131
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:24,419
TO DISMANTLE IT.

132
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,955
WE ALL REMEMBER STEPHEN BANNON

133
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:29,957
TALKING ABOUT DISMANTLING THE

134
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:30,625
ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, WHICH

135
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,560
PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS SCARY.

136
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,361
THIS GUY SEEMS TO THINK IT'S

137
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:36,064
WORTH SAVING.

138
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,099
>> LET'S NOT FORGET THAT

139
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,435
NEWT GINGRICH 20 PLUS YEARS AGO,

140
00:03:40,435 --> 00:03:41,335
23 YEARS AGO, IT RAN THE

141
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:43,538
CONTRACT FOR AMERICA, AND PART

142
00:03:43,538 --> 00:03:48,342
OF THAT CONTRACT WAS ELIMINATING

143
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:50,144
FEDERAL AGENCIES AND GOVERNMENT

144
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,778
BUREAUCRACY.

145
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:51,446
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A

146
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:52,814
LONG TIME.

147
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:54,749
WAS AT THE TIP OF THE SPEAR ON

148
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:56,451
THIS STUFF.

149
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:57,118
DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES IN THE

150
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:59,187
SAFETY NET.

151
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:00,555
HE BELIEVES IN GOOD GOVERNMENT,

152
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:01,589
HE JUST DOESN'T BELIEVE IN

153
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:03,357
BLOATED GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S

154
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:05,159
WHERE WE ARE.

155
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,427
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE

156
00:04:06,427 --> 00:04:09,564
LEARNED AND PRESIDENT TRUMP

157
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:10,798
LEARNED IN SIGNING THIS REALLY

158
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:13,201
BAD BILL IS HE'S NOT GOING TO DO

159
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,302
IT AGAIN AND I THINK THE MEMBERS

160
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:15,436
OF CONGRESS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

161
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:17,071
BRING HIM A BILL THAT'S MUCH

162
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:18,238
MORE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE NEXT

163
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:18,539
TIME.

164
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:19,807
>> Martha: THAT'S GOING TO BE

165
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:20,774
INTERESTING BECAUSE WE WILL SEE

166
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:21,541
THAT HAPPEN IN THE FALL AND THEN

167
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,945
AGAIN IN DECEMBER.

168
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:25,446
OPPORTUNITIES TO ACTUALLY HAVE A

169
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:26,981
BUDGET AND DO NOT DO THESE

170
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:27,982
CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS THAT JUST

171
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:28,716
KEEP GOING ON AND ON AND ON AND

172
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:31,786
ON IN THE GOVERNMENT.

173
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:33,554
THE EVEN DARKER SIDE OF THIS,

174
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:35,723
JASON CHAFFETZ, IS WHAT THE

175
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:37,458
ADMINISTRATION SEES AS THE

176
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,659
EFFORT TO UNDERMINE THEM WITH

177
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,360
THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION AND

178
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,128
THAT ALL OF IT GOES BACK TO THAT

179
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:43,965
OF THEIR MOUTH STOMACH MOST

180
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:45,833
POWERFUL TOOL TO PREVENT THE ADM

181
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:45,867
POWERFUL TOOL TO PREVENT THE ADN

182
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:45,900
POWERFUL TOOL TO PREVENT THE ADS

183
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:45,933
POWERFUL TOOL TO PREVENT THE ADR

184
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:45,967
POWERFUL TOOL TO PREVENT THE ADT

185
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:46,000
POWERFUL TOOL TO PREVENT THE ADO

186
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:47,168
FROM DOING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO,

187
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:50,972
WHICH IS TO SAY MAYBE WE DON'T

188
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:51,706
