The process you see is actually using
indigenous Mars materials or materials
available elsewhere in the
solar system combined
with materials that can be recycled
from what's already onboard a
spaceship, so that you can carry as
little weight with you to construct
a structure in space.
The big point of it all is
carrying weight into space is
extraordinarily expensive. I think the
figure used to be something like,
you know, $10 million a
pound. Because the fuel
that you'll need to burn to
actually get that into orbit
is just absolutely insane,
and the size of the spacecraft you
need to actually handle that.
The idea is to take as little
with you as possible,
and to use whatever is available
— whatever you're already taking
with you in the form of the spacecraft —
and then whatever you can find.
We're using about 80 pounds
of material for that dome compared
to four or five hundred for
the concrete domes,
and yet achieve comparable strength
to a fully cured concrete mixture
without having to wait 30 days for
the cure, without having to deal
with water, which is going to be very
difficult on a place like Mars
where your daily surface temperature
could be as high as 70 degrees,
but as low as negative
190 degrees Fahrenheit.
