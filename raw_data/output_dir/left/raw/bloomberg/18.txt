1
00:00:01,463 --> 00:00:05,216
I'm Kim Bhasin, luxury
reporter at Bloomberg,

2
00:00:05,216 --> 00:00:08,175
here to invite you into
the most exclusive realms

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,703
of luxury retail.

4
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:14,463
This is Invitation Only.

5
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:19,710
Today, I'm a train ride
away from Manhattan

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,902
on Long Island's North Shore.

7
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:24,323
This is a super wealthy community.

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,197
This is old money.

9
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:30,542
I'm talkin' the Vanderbilt's, the Astor's,

10
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:34,405
the Whitney's, J.P. Morgan,

11
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:35,748
and when you're this rich,

12
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:37,491
you don't have time to go into Manhattan

13
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:41,258
to buy a new outfit for the
yacht club or a polo match

14
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:44,753
or one of those weird
eyes wide shut parties.

15
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:47,684
You just go down the street

16
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:50,961
to the fanciest shopping center around,

17
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:52,843
Americana Manhasset.

18
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,270
(rhythmic beat)

19
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,014
To understand extravagance
of this scale in breadth,

20
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:01,262
I needed to speak to someone

21
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:04,248
who knew the Manhasset inside and out

22
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:06,893
so I met with Deidre Costa Major,

23
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:08,993
the president of the property.

24
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:13,630
What is Americana Manhasset?

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,921
How would you describe this mall?

26
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:18,011
First I would tell you we're not a mall,

27
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,622
we're a shopping center.

28
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,352
We're a shopping destination.

29
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:22,393
It looks like a mall.

30
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:23,597
There's a bunch of stores.

31
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:27,410
Peter Marino, our master
architect, does not do malls

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,423
so it's only a shopping center.

33
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:35,511
The makeup is to have two
streets, one on either side.

34
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:39,003
So we have, on the north
side, the luxury brands.

35
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:43,903
On the south side, the
contemporary brands.

36
00:01:45,924 --> 00:01:47,095
Well, it's much smaller

37
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:50,056
than your traditional suburban mall.

38
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:52,350
We're a small footprint

39
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,153
and so we only have the best of the best.

40
00:01:56,204 --> 00:01:58,177
Now, if you're lookin' to do some shopping

41
00:01:58,177 --> 00:02:01,135
at one of the best of the best in luxury,

42
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:04,961
but you're far too lazy
to do it all by yourself,

43
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:06,419
you'll want to head to the Manhasset's

44
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,114
personal shopping service,

45
00:02:08,114 --> 00:02:10,098
where someone like Lucianna Giambrone

46
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:13,690
could do all that hard work for you.

47
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,011
So a lot of our clients

48
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,480
don't necessarily always have the time

49
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,710
to shop at their convenience

50
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,600
so we wanna make it easy for them.

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,669
We have two assistants that help us

52
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,940
set up the room for our clients.

53
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,979
I like to always be involved.

54
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:29,989
I have to see what's out
there, what I think can work.

55
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:32,600
Do people come in not knowing anything

56
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,801
about what they want

57
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:36,810
and just need some style
advice and redo their wardrobe?

58
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,976
Yes, that happens all the time

59
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:40,928
and we do closet consultations, as well.

60
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,231
So before we start adding
things in your closet

61
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,720
that I'm not really sure
that you exactly need,

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,408
I will go to the home, we'll
schedule an appointment,

63
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:50,901
and we'll purge some items

64
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,793
that I don't think will
work in your closet anymore.

65
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:54,086
Purge 'em, get 'em out of there.

66
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:56,014
And then we'll add new pieces

67
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:58,117
that can work with the
existing pieces that you have

68
00:02:58,117 --> 00:02:59,965
so you're not just buying in bulk

69
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:03,294
and then feel like you still
don't have anything to wear.

70
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:06,371
Lucianna has more than 100 clients,

71
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:10,510
from normals like you and
me to A-list celebrities.

72
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,088
What do celebrities like
about this kind of space?

73
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:15,486
We're very fortunate to be privately owned

74
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,685
so celebrities feel more at home here,

75
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:20,217
it's quiet, we're under the radar,

76
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:22,751
and they are allowed to shop the center

77
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:25,563
without feeling like
people are on top of them.

78
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:27,127
So they can go out and walk the center

79
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:28,167
and not get harassed here?

80
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,196
Absolutely, yep.

81
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:30,719
You like, stop photographers,

82
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,837
the paparazzi at the gate or something?

83
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,980
Yes, exactly.
There you go.

84
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,173
That's what we do.

85
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,363
Since I knew the pap
wouldn't be all over me,

86
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:42,874
I felt like it was time to shop

87
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:45,082
so I headed to Hirsh Leifers,

88
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:46,503
a high-end department store

89
00:03:46,503 --> 00:03:49,800
and one of the Manhasset's original shops.

90
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,743
Hi.
Hi.

91
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:52,198
Welcome to Hirsh Leifers.

92
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,920
All right, so what is this place?

93
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,759
We're a luxury specialty store

94
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:00,280
that's been here in
the Americana Manhasset

95
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,193
for over 60 years.

96
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:06,404
We were one of the original tenants

97
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:08,320
and actually one of the first tenants

98
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,433
to bring luxury out to the center.

99
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,151
60 years ago it was nothing like that.

100
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:17,558
There was a supermarket, a movie theater,

101
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,763
I think there was a great fondue place.

102
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,894
The luxury market has changed
dramatically over the years

103
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:29,592
and certainly accelerated over
the past three to five years.

104
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:32,016
Our Chanel client is
wearing Air Force Ones

105
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:35,939
with their $12,000 Chanel
blazers and vice versa.

106
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:39,952
You know, I think the
convergence of luxury and street,

107
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:44,093
it's a marriage and
it's not going anywhere.

108
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:48,084
How often are you moving stuff around,

109
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:51,560
and renovating, and changing
things in the store?

110
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,890
We're under constant change.

111
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,612
Constant change, constant
drops, constant events.

112
00:04:57,612 --> 00:04:59,751
We all know what's
going on now, certainly.

113
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:01,559
Department stores are an having issue.

114
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:05,670
Online has certainly done
things to the industry,

115
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,956
but, you know, for us,

116
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:10,569
we can continue to expand,
and evolve, and flourish,

117
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:13,010
but not without a lot of focus

118
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,045
and a lot of change constantly.

119
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:18,712
(rhythmic beat)

120
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:23,044
In an age when many traditional retailers

121
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:24,756
are struggling,

122
00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:27,607
Americana Manhasset is doing quite well,

123
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:29,620
especially as a mall.

124
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,070
Wait.

125
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,135
Sorry, shopping center.

126
00:05:33,135 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a shopping center.
