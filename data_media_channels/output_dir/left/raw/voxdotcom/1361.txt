1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,520
In most of the world, this is a strange sight.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,890
It’s a TV commercial for a prescription drug.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,099
These ads are illegal in most countries.

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,220
but in the US, they’re everywhere.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,220
On average, 80 of them air every hour on American television.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,640
"Ask your doctor."

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,000
"...my doctor told me..."

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,280
"Ask your doctor."

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,180
The American Medical Association, a major group of doctors, has called for a

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,190
ban on these direct-to-consumer ads.

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,400
But there’s a case to be made for them too.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,440
So today we’ll take a look at both sides.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,160
First, a little background.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,220
Before the 1980s, prescription drug commercials were unheard of in the US.

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,600
Drug companies focused their marketing solely on doctors, and they didn’t want to hurt

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,090
those relationships.

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,590
When asked by Congress in 1984, if direct-to-consumer advertising should be allowed, one pharmaceutical

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,050
executive said:

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,780
And an executive at Schering-Plough, which is now part of Merck, said:

20
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,870
Needless to say, they changed their minds.

21
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,070
At the time there was a larger cultural shift
in health care toward empowering patients

22
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,110
to make decisions rather than just listening
to their doctors.

23
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,600
And advertisements fit with that trend.

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,800
Drug Ads started appearing in print publications, but there was still another thing keeping them off TV,

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,860
and that was FDA’s regulations at the
time.

26
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,280
They were interpreted as requiring ads to
include all of the information about the drug’s

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,320
risks and side effects, which simply wasn’t feasible to do in

28
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,020
a tv or radio commercial the way it was in
a magazine.

29
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,170
There was a bizarre loophole though: The ads didn’t have to mention the drug’s risks,

30
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,450
if they also didn’t mention the disease
or condition that the drug was supposed to treat.

31
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,860
Here’s what that looked like — in an ad
for Claritin back before it was available

32
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,000
over the counter: "It’s time."

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,140
"It’s time!"

34
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,360
"Don’t wait another minute with Claritin."

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,320
"Claritin."

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,520
"I’ll ask my doctor!"

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,580
"It’s time to see your doctor."

38
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,320
"Mr. Wilkin, the doctor will see you now."

39
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,880
"At last, a clear day is here."

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,140
Confused?

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,660
Yeah, everyone was.

42
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,000
So in 1997, the FDA clarified that the industry could run the full drug ads and wouldn’t

43
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,930
have to give ALL the risk information from
the label, as long as they included the major

44
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,540
side effects and referred viewers to another source for the rest.

45
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,240
That’s why the commercials direct us to
phone numbers or print ads.

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,560
Come for the pharmaceutical fine print — stay for “the secret to crisp contact in soggy conditions”

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,140
That new FDA guidance removed the main barrier

48
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,319
keeping drugs off of television.

49
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,699
and you can guess what happened next...

50
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,120
spending on ads quadrupled by 2004. And now, we know the names of prescription drugs like

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,320
we know the names of cars and clothing brands.

52
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,140
"Lunesta, Xanax, Celebrex, Flomax, and HGH."

53
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,400
"And as of Thursday, Lipitor."

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,440
"Oh and if you have trouble sleeping, Marla has Ambien. I prefer Lunesta."

55
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,340
"Lipitor, Baby Aspirin... Flomax."

56
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,740
"Flomax?"

57
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,520
"…and some Cialis!

58
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,270
I’m just assuming."

59
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,770
So that’s how we got here.

60
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,980
Drug ads are now the most frequent form of health communication that most Americans see.

61
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,410
So what does that mean for public health?

62
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,660
Are those prescriptions going to the right
people?

63
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,170
Or are they going to people who probably won’t benefit from the drug — people for whom the potential

64
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,110
risks outweigh the potential benefits?

65
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,680
Well, the answer seems to be: both.

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,900
A clever experiment in 2005 tested this by
sending actors to real primary care doctors.

67
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,360
Dr. Richard Kravitz: We helped them make appointments.

68
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,810
In half of the visits, the actors reported
symptoms of depression.

69
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,940
In the other half of the visits, the actors
said they were feeling down

70
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,400
after becoming unemployed.

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,480
The study authors called this an “adjustment disorder.”

72
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:31,300
In some visits, the actors mentioned seeing
an advertisement for Paxil on TV,

73
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,580
that's an antidepressant.

74
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,409
In others, they didn’t bring up medication
at all.

75
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:40,470
And the doctors seemed to take patients more seriously if they mentioned seeing the Paxil commercial.

76
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,479
They were more likely to refer patients to
a mental health consultation,

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,360
And much more likely to prescribe an antidepressant.

78
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,490
That may be a good thing for those with major depression, who might benefit from an medication.

79
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,800
But it’s more questionable for those with
a more temporary condition.

80
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,841
This study, and others, have shown that doctors can be persuaded to broaden the scope of who

81
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:08,919
gets treated with drugs.

82
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,270
And advertisements often seem designed to encourage that.

83
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,099
Take Androgel — it was approved to treat men with hypogonadism: that’s extremely low

84
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:20,680
testosterone levels due to injury or disease.

85
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,460
But here’s how it was promoted by Abbott:
"Millions of men 45 and older just don’t

86
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,900
feel like they used to.

87
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,889
Are you one of them?

88
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,839
Remember when you had more energy for 18 holes with your buddies?

89
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,759
More passion for the one you love."

90
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,260
Some middle aged men don’t feel like they
used to?

91
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,340
You don’t say.

92
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,160
A study looking back at 10 years of testosterone prescriptions found that only half had been

93
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,800
diagnosed with hypogonadism in the previous year.

94
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,560
Drug ads give the industry an incentive to
make healthy people feel unhealthy.

95
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,560
“Latisse is the only FDA approved prescription treatment for inadequate, or not enough lashes.”

96
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,249
And they contribute to unrealistic expectations about what pharmaceuticals can do.

97
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:04,999
So what’s wrong with that?

98
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,720
Well, every single drug comes with risks.

99
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,009
Big ad campaigns are usually for newer drugs, for which not all the risks may be known yet.

100
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:18,740
In the case of the painkiller Vioxx, a massive ad campaign led millions of people with arthritis

101
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,520
to switch to Vioxx instead of sticking with
older drugs like Ibuprofen.

102
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,439
“It’s a beautiful morning…ask your doctor
today about Vioxx, and find out what Vioxx

103
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,939
can do for you."

104
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:31,180
Vioxx was more expensive and not actually

105
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,440
more effective, and...

106
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,040
“The manufacturer of Vioxx have just recently pulled this popular arthritis drug from the

107
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,279
market over health concerns."

108
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,439
Merck withdrew the drug after it became clear

109
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,130
that it increased the risk of heart attacks
and stroke.

110
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,550
A Kaiser Permanente study later confirmed
that ad exposure was linked to inappropriate

111
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,139
prescribing of Vioxx and a similar drug called Celebrex.

112
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,859
So that’s a worst case scenario.

113
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,860
But there is also an argument that these ads can be good for public health.

114
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,280
Sidney Taurel: “There are many diseases for which people don’t seek treatment.

115
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:10,860
So if you can educate through direct-to-consumer
about the fact that this can be treated, you

116
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,860
will get a better outcome for everyone.”

117
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,700
In their view, more communication with your

118
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,839
doctor is always a good thing.

119
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,189
And it’s up to the doctor to make the right
prescribing decisions.

120
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:24,499
Surveys of the public have confirmed that
drug ads prompt people to visit their doctor,

121
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:28,969
in some cases for diabetes, hypertension, depression — these are conditions that are thought to

122
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:30,720
be under treated.

123
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,180
In the case of the HPV vaccine, that's now recommended for all pre-teens to prevent cervical and

124
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,860
other cancers, Merck’s ad blitz for Gardasil
probably reached more people than a government

125
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,999
communications effort could.

126
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:47,240
And whatever you think of erectile dysfunction drugs, they got men to see their doctors and

127
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,000
undergo the required heart screening, potentially catching problems not yet treated.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,189
But the strongest argument in favor of drug
ads may be the legal one.

129
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:00,710
The Supreme Court ruled in favor of prescription drug advertising back in the 1970s, when the

130
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,260
state of Virginia tried to prohibit pharmacists from advertising their prices.

131
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,700
Harry Blackmun: “We further hold that so called commercial speech is not wholly outside the protection

132
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,080
of the 1st and 14th amendments.

133
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,279
The individual consumer and society in general may have strong interests in the free flow

134
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,949
of commercial information.”

135
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,169
It was the first time that the Court said
advertisements were entitled to

136
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,980
free speech protections.

137
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,229
There was only one dissenting Justice at the time: William Rehnquist — who Ronald Reagan

138
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:34,510
would later appoint Chief Justice —
In his dissent, Rehnquist wrote a kind of

139
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,650
uncanny prediction of the type of commercials that would come decades later:

140
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,140
"Don't spend another sleepless night.

141
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,000
Ask your doctor to prescribe Seconal without delay."

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,210
Rehnquist worried that ads would “generate patient pressure on physicians to prescribe”

143
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,090
drugs; and that they’d end up being “advertised on television.”

144
00:08:53,090 --> 00:00:00,000
And as we know now, for better or for worse, that’s exactly what happened.
