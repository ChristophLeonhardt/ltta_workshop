WHETHER TRUMP'S
BASE STAYS LOYAL TO HIM, I THINK
IT'S A MORE PRESSING QUESTION TO
CONSIDER WHETHER THE HOUSE WILL
STAY LOYAL TO HIM.
OBVIOUSLY
IT'S CONTROLLED BY THE
REPUBLICANS WHICH MEANS THEY CAN
ACCOMPLISH PRETTY MUCH WHATEVER
THEY WANT, AT LEAST IN THE
HOUSE, AND MOSTLY THE SENATE AS
WELL.
AND WHILE THE SENATE
COULDN'T PASS A VERSION OF
TRUMPCARE, THE HOUSE ACTUALLY
DID IT.
THEY EVENTUALLY PUSH
SOMETHING THROUGH THAT YOU HAVE
TO BET SOMEDAY IS GOING TO BITE
THEM ON THE ASS WHEN IT COMES TO
CAMPAIGN ADS BEING RUN AGAINST
THEM BECAUSE IT WOULD KICK TENS
OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OFF HEALTH
INSURANCE.
BUT THEY DID IT, AND
THEY DID IT WITH THE ASSURANCES
THAT IT WOULD PAY OFF BECAUSE
THE SENATE WOULD EVENTUALLY DO
IT, THE WHOLE PARTY WOULD BE
TOGETHER, AND THEY COULD SAY THE
ACCOMPANIST SOMETHING.
BUT IT
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT WILL
HAPPEN, WHICH MEANS THAT THOSE
HOUSE REPUBLICANS PUT THEIR ASS
ON THE LINE, AND THEY ARE JUST
GOING TO GET THE NEGATIVE FOR
IT.
THEY WILL BE ATTACKED,
POTENTIALLY PRIMARIED --
>>GOOD.
>>I THINK IT'S GOOD, BUT FROM
THEIR POINT OF VIEW PROBABLY
NOT.
IT TURNS OUT THEY ARE
PISSED THAT DONALD TRUMP.
>>ARE YOU NOT TAKING PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WAY YOU
VOTED?
AW.
LET'S HEAR FROM THEM.
>>WE WILL HEAR FROM THE POOR
BABIES.
REPRESENTATIVE MARK
AMODEI OF NEVADA SAID --
>>AND THE 
WAY IT'S DESCRIBED IS
--
>>OH.
OKAY, SO YOU'RE UPSET -- I
LOVE HOW HE IS BELITTLING THE
INTELLIGENCE OF MEMBERS OF THE
SENATE WHILE HE COMPLAINS ABOUT
VOTING FOR LEGISLATION THAT HE
MAYBE DIDN'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE
IN, BECAUSE HE WANTED TO APPEASE
THE EMPEROR.
WHO IS THE DUMB ONE
IN THIS SCENARIO?
>>I THINK EVERYBODY.
>>OKAY, THAT'S FAIR, BUT I WOULD
ARGUE THAT MODERATE REPUBLICANS
WHO ACTUALLY TOOK A PRINCIPLED
STAND AND SAID NO, MY
CONSTITUENTS ARE IN FAVOR OF
THIS, I WILL REPRESENT THEM AND
NOT CAVE TO SOMEONE LIKE TRUMP,
I THINK THEY ARE A LITTLE
SMARTER.
I KNOW YOU ARE A LITTLE
UPSET BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT
PRINTABLE IN ANY WAY AND YOU
FEEL LIKE THIS WILL NEGATIVELY
IMPACT YOU, BUT IT SHOULD
NEGATIVELY IMPACT YOU.
>>IT WASN'T JUST HIM, WE ALSO
HAVE DARRELL ISSA WHO SAID --
>>WELL, THEY CAME UP WITH
SCRIBBLES AT THE VERY LEAST.
THAT COULD BE FUN. AND THERE
WERE OTHER REPRESENTATIVES NOT
WILLING TO GO ON THE RECORD
EXPRESSING HOW MAD THEY WERE.
I
DON'T COVER THIS BECAUSE I CARE
ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS, I REALLY
DON'T, BUT IT'S INTERESTING FROM
THE POINT OF VIEW OF A TRUMP
DEFENDER, WILL TRUMP BE ABLE TO
COUNT ON THE HOUSE TO PASS
CONTROVERSIAL LEGISLATION THAT
COULD POTENTIALLY DAMAGE THEM
AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE?
AFTER
TRYING IT ONCE AND BEING BURNED,
ARE THEY GOING TO BE THERE?
THE
WHOLE FOR ME ONCE, CAN'T GET
FOOLED AGAIN -- MAYBE THEY
CAN'T GET FOOLED AGAIN.
WE WILL HAVE TO FIND OUT.
>>THEY WILL DO IT AGAIN, THEY
WILL DO IT EVERY TIME.
THE ONE
WHO WAS THE MOST SCATHING OF
THOSE ANONYMOUS CONGRESSIONAL
MEMBERS, MAD ABOUT THE WAY THIS
CAME FORWARD, HE SAID IN ORDER
TO SPEAK CANDIDLY ABOUT IT I
WOULD LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND LAY
INTO HIM SO DON'T GIVE THEM MY
NAME.
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
EVERY ASPECT OF THE WAY THESE
POLITICIANS WORK.
DON'T SAY MY
NAME, BECAUSE WHAT I'M ABOUT TO
SAY WILL GET ME IN TROUBLE.
SO
DO YOU MEAN IT?
IF YOU SAY WHAT
YOU REALLY MEAN IS A POLITICIAN,
YOU WON'T BE A POLITICIAN
ANYMORE.
THINK ABOUT THE NATURE
OF THE SYSTEM, I CAN'T SAY WHO I
AM BECAUSE THEY WILL KILL ME IF
THEY HEAR WHAT I REALLY FEEL
ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING.
THEY KNOW
HOW BAD EVERYTHING IS, HOW BAD
THE LEGISLATION THEY PUT FORWARD
IS, THEY KNOW THEY WILL GET A OF
CAMPAIGN ADS AGAINST THEM,
BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW BAD IT IS.
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DOING
THEIR JOB.
IT HAS TO DO WITH
KEEPING THEIR JOB.
AND CONTINUE TO DECEIVE THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
