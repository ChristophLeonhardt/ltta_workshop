1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,940
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI IS NOW
DONALD TRUMP'S NEW

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,470
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, AND IN
THIS VIDEO WE WILL BREAK DOWN

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,009
SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF HOW HE HAS
COMMUNICATED OVER THE PAST FEW

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,139
YEARS, STARTING WITH THIS.

5
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:14,400
THE PRESIDENT IS THE MOST
COMPETITIVE PERSON I'VE EVER

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,400
MET.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,532
I'VE SEEN THIS GUY THROW --

8
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:21,020
I'M MOVING AROUND PAPER RIGHT
NOW, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,330
HACK POLITICIAN.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,980
ARE YOU CALLING DONALD TRUMP A
HACK?

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,220
HE WILL PROBABLY MAKE
ELIZABETH WARREN IS VICE

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,560
PRESIDENT OF NOMINEE WITH
COMMENTS LIKE THAT.

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
IT'S

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,560
ANTI-AMERICAN, IT'S DIVISIVE.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,500
I
TELL YOU WHO WILL BE PRESIDENT

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,540
OF, YOU CAN TELL HIM I SAID IT,
THE QUEENS COUNTY BULLIES

17
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,260
ASSOCIATION.

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,220
CUT IT OUT AND STOP THIS CRAZY
RHETORIC.

19
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,670
I LIKE YOU SAY THAT NOW, BUT
I'VE HAD A PROBLEM WITH HOW

20
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,340
HE TALKED ABOUT WOMEN FOR YEARS.

21
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,780
I DON'T LIKE HOW HE TALKS
ABOUT WOMEN, ABOUT OUR FRIEND

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,420
MEGYN KELLY, THE POLITICIANS
DON'T WANT TO GO AT TRUMP

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,130
BECAUSE HE HAS A BIG MOUTH, THEY
ARE AFRAID HE WILL WRITE THEM UP

24
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,640
ON FOX NEWS, BUT I'M NOT A
POLITICIAN.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,619
BRING IT.

26
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:10,280
WHY IS HE RESONATING?

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,719
YOU ARE AN INHERITED MONEY
DUDE FROM QUEENS COUNTY.

28
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,719
BRING

29
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,719
IT, DONALD.

30
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,719
BLAMING THE HEDGE
FUND COMMUNITY IS RIGHT OUT OF

31
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:25,909
ELIZABETH WARREN'S PLAYBOOK.

32
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,450
STAND HERE AND PROVE YOU AREN'T

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,859
A PLANT FOR THE DEMOCRATS.

34
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,420
THIS IS RIGHT OUT OF THE
OBAMA, WARREN, CLINTON PLAYBOOK.

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,320
LET'S SHOW THE EVIDENCE TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE, HE'S A

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,649
CLASS DIVIDER.

37
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:43,180
GIVE HIM CREDIT, DONALD TRUMP
HAS REDUCED JEB BUSH, SCOTT

38
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,090
WALKER, AND MARCO RUBIO ALMOST
TO THE RELEVANCE.

39
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,289
FOR NOW.

40
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:53,290
THEIR INTERNAL POLLS ARE
SHOWING -- BEFORE THE INTERNAL

41
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,249
POLLS SHOWED THAT --

42
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,249
I'M

43
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:01,020
HEARING RAP IN MY EAR BUT I
DON'T WANT A RAP, THIS NONSENSE

44
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,079
WILL END AND I PREDICT IT WILL
END BEFORE THINGS GIVING.

45
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,929
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI ON THE
RECORD ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.

46
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,319
HAVE THERE EVER BEEN TO PEOPLE
ON A PANEL WHO WANTED TO TALK TO

47
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,569
EACH OTHER LESS?

48
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,430
HE WAS NOT
HAVING THAT GUY WHO KEPT

49
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,019
INTERRUPTING HIM OVER AND OVER.

50
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,560
THAT WAS THAT GUY GOING I SAID
THAT TOO.

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,959
EVERY DAY THAT WAS ME AND CENK
IN 2004 AND 2005, TRUST ME.

52
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,629
THAT WAS PRETTY BRUTAL.

53
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:34,930
THAT WAS.

54
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,019
I WILL HAVE SOME TWEETS IN A
SECOND.

55
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:42,790
SCARAMUCCI -- I'M SURE A VERY
SMART GUY, FIRST OF ALL TO GET

56
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,770
FIRED AT -- NOT AT LEHMAN
BROTHERS BUT AT -- WHERE IS

57
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,560
EVERYONE AT?

58
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,590
NOW OR THEN?

59
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,489
GOLDMAN SACHS?

60
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,920
HE GOT FIRED AND REHIRED AT
GOLDMAN SACHS.

61
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,630
HE'S CLEARLY IMPRESSIVE.

62
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,760
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS FIRED.

63
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,299
THAT HE BROKE OFF, HE STARTED
A FUND THAT ADVISED OTHER FUNDS

64
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:19,680
-- HE'S THINKING, SO HE'S A
SMARTER GUY I SUSPECT THAN MOST

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
PEOPLE IN THAT ADMINISTRATION.

66
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,409
BUT THIS GUY JUST COMPARED THE

67
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:28,590
OBAMA, WARREN, HILLARY CLINTON
PLAYBOOK ON WALL STREET -- THOSE

68
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,409
THREE PEOPLE COULDN'T BE FURTHER
APART ON WALL STREET.

69
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:33,409
OBAMA

70
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:37,200
PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN
WARREN AND HILLARY CLINTON, BUT

71
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,670
THOSE THREE PEOPLE DON'T OPERATE
ON THE SAME PLAYBOOK.

72
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,959
IN 2010 AT

73
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,909
THE TOWN HALL, BECAUSE HE WENT
TO LAW SCHOOL WITH OBAMA AT

74
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:47,670
HARVARD, HE ASKED OBAMA IN A
TOWN HALL, FIRST QUESTION, WHEN

75
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,560
ARE WE GOING TO STOP WHACKING AT
THE WALL STREET PI—ATA?

76
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
HE ASKED

77
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
OBAMA.

78
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,680
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT.

79
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,290
IN THEIR MINDS, THE BIGGEST
PROBLEM WITH BARACK OBAMA,

80
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,390
TOO TOUGH ON WALL STREET.

81
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,709
WHICH IS CRAZY.

82
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,420
I FELT THAT.

83
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,420
EXACTLY.

84
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,780
OH NO, NOBODY WENT TO
PRISON.

85
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,120
THAT WAS THE JUSTICE

86
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,829
DEPARTMENT, BUT IF OBAMA HAD
SAID LET'S GO -- THERE ARE A LOT

87
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:22,029
OF COMPLICATED REASONS ABOUT WHY
PROSECUTORS GOT SO TIMID WITH

88
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,730
PROSECUTING PEOPLE ON WALL
STREET, INTERESTING BOOK OUT NOW

89
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,730
ON THAT, OR COMING OUT SOON,
DAVID SIROTA HAD THE GUY ON --

90
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,340
BUT NONETHELESS THEY DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING.

91
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,340
IN THE NOTION THAT

92
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:41,070
DODD-FRANK WAS WHACKING AT THE
WALL STREET PI—ATA -- SO AGAIN,

93
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,280
IF YOU THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP
IS GOING TO COME IN AND GET

94
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,340
TOUGH AND DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS
AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF WALL

95
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,330
STREET, YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR
EFFIN' MIND.

96
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,580
WE ALREADY KNEW

97
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,580
THAT.

98
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,010
I LOVE THAT IN THAT METAPHOR
WALL STREET IS A PI—ATA, WHICH

99
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,060
IS LIKE A SHALLOW OBJECT THAT'S
BEEN STUFFED FULL OF STUFF IT

100
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,580
NEVER EARNED -- AND THAT'S HIS
ANALOGY.

101
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,580
THAT VIDEO WAS GOOD BUT

102
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,201
THERE'S OTHER STUFF AS WELL THAT
WILL SOON BE PAPERED OVER, IN

103
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:14,950
FACT MANY OF THESE TWEETS HAVE
SINCE BEEN DELETED, BUT HE

104
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,950
TWEETED --

105
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:26,190
I BET HE DOESN'T DELETE ANY
OF THEM.

106
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,630
HE ALREADY HAS DELETED THEM.

107
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,160
I BET HE DELETES THOSE.

108
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,910
I REALLY LIKE THIS NEXT ONE --
WALLS DON'T WORK, NEVER HAVE,

109
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:35,910
NEVER WILL.

110
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,210
THE BERLIN WALL,
DON'T FALL FOR ONE IT.

111
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,070
THAT WALL WORKED FOR 28 YEARS.

112
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,250
ANOTHER ONE --

113
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:56,410
HE 
RAISED MONEY FOR OBAMA IN

114
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,450
2008.

115
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:05,510
ANOTHER ONE --

116
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,110
EXCEPT WHEN MY BOSS DOES IT, I
DON'T MIND THAT SO MUCH.

117
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,110
I DON'T

118
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,110
KNOW IF THAT ONE IS DELETED.

119
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,110
HE
ALSO HAD AN INTERESTING

120
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,690
EVOLUTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE, AS
PEOPLE DO AS THEY GET OLDER.

121
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,690
AT

122
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,380
ONE POINT HE SAID CLIMATE
SCIENCE WAS INDISPUTABLE, HE

123
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,400
LATER WENT ON TO SAY I'M NOT A
SCIENTIST, AND HE EVOLVED

124
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,070
BETWEEN JUNE AND DECEMBER OF
LAST YEAR.

125
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,180
HERE IS THE THING, WE

126
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,590
UNDERSTAND THAT IN BLOOD I GUESS
MAYBE IT'S TO TRUMP'S CREDIT

127
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,030
THAT HE BRINGS IN PEOPLE WHO
ONCE CRITICIZED HIM, BUT IT'S

128
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,280
THE FAKENESS, AND THE PAID
PERJUROR.

129
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,310
ON HIS FIRST DAY,

130
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:53,540
SCARAMUCCI SAID THIS --

131
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,751
HE CHANGED HIS POSITION ON
CLIMATE CHANGE, HE WILL CHANGE

132
00:06:55,751 --> 00:07:00,260
HIS POSITION ON GUNS, HE ONCE
SPOKE CRITICALLY OF THE WAY

133
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,730
TRUMP SPOKE ABOUT ISLAM AND
TRIED TO PORTRAY IT AS A

134
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,850
RELIGION OF VIOLENCE, BUT ALL OF
THAT, ALL OF WHAT MAKES A PERSON

135
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,360
THE PERSON THEY ARE, THE VALUES
THEY HAVE, GO OUT THE DOOR ONCE

136
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,720
YOU ARE STANDING AT THAT PODIUM.

137
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,180
THAT'S ONE THING THE PEOPLE HATE
ABOUT POLITICS THAT TRUMP

138
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,040
WAS SUPPOSED TO CHANGE, BUT IT'S
JUST ANOTHER ITERATION OF IT.

139
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,180
HE WANTED THIS POSITION OF
POWER, OBVIOUSLY HE DOESN'T NEED

140
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:33,590
THE MONEY, HE'S RICH BEYOND
ANYONE'S WILDEST DREAMS.

141
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,660
OF COURSE YOU COULD HAVE SAID
THAT ABOUT TRUMP.

142
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,200
HE WANTS IT BECAUSE HE WANTS
POWER.

143
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
SCARAMUCCI, GIVEN THOSE

144
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,780
THINGS, IF HE HAD SAID THE
DEMOCRATS ARE A DEAD PARTY AND

145
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,500
THEY ARE TOO TOUGH ON WALL
STREET, SCARAMUCCI COULD HAVE

146
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,280
SAID I'M THROWING MY SUPPORT
BEHIND JOHN KASICH AND I HOPE HE

147
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,710
RUNS.

148
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,940
THAT WOULD BE FAIRLY
PRINCIPLED.

149
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:05,200
HE CHECKED HIS PRINCIPLES AT
THE DOOR.

150
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,740
IT'S THE WORST OF US,

151
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,950
IT'S POLITICS FOR POLITICS SAKE,
AND MAYBE THEY GET THEIR HEAD TO

152
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,051
SOMEPLACE WHERE THEY SAY IT'S
ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT, SOME

153
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:17,210
SORT OF MODEST LEGISLATIVE
ACHIEVEMENT, I DON'T HOW THEY

154
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,510
GET THEIR HEADS AROUND.

155
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,920
ITS
DESPICABLE.

156
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,590
IN THE NATION, THEY SAID SEAN
SPICER AIDED AND ABETTED THE

157
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,940
WORST OF DONALD TRUMP.

158
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,940
IF YOU
ARE IN CHARGE OF THE MESSAGING

159
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,059
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE LIKELY TO
HAVE TO DO.

160
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,009
LET'S PLAY ONE MORE CLIP.

161
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,490
IF
YOU BELIEVE THAT ANTHONY

162
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,020
SCARAMUCCI MIGHT TELL THE TRUTH
IN A WAY WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN IN

163
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,690
THE PAST, LISTEN TO THIS CLIP
FROM TODAY WHEN ASKED IF DONALD

164
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,840
TRUMP IS FEELING UNDER SIEGE.

165
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,170
HE'S THE MOST COMPETITIVE
PERSON I'VE EVER MET.

166
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,170
I'VE SEEN

167
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,370
THIS GUY THROW A DEAD SPIRAL
THROUGH A TIRE.

168
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,790
I SEEN HIM AT

169
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,390
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, WITH A
TOPCOAT ON, HITTING FOUL SHOTS.

170
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,380
HE SINKS THREE-FOOT PUTTS.

171
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,110
I
DON'T SEE HIM UNDER SIEGE, THIS

172
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,180
IS A COMPETITIVE PERSON,
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF

173
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:23,560
INCOMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT
THE PRESIDENT IS A WINNER

174
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,480
AND WE WILL DO A LOT OF WINNING.

175
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,900
THAT HE HAD THAT HALF-COURT
SHOT IN A TOPCOAT FOR A $50,000

176
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
CHECK?

177
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
THAT'S HOW HE GOT HIS MONEY.

178
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,200
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IN
A PRESIDENT, GUY WHO CAN THROW A

179
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
SPIRAL THROUGH A TIRE.

180
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,070
BY THE
WAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE ON TWITTER

181
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,850
WERE LIKE, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

182
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:45,230
HE'S TRYING TO PORTRAY THIS
GUY WHO IS LAZY AS THIS SPORTS

183
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,230
HERO.

184
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,840
BUT EVEN I, I'M NOT HUGE
ON SPORTS -- HE SAID HE THREW A

185
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,390
SPIRAL THROUGH A TIRE, HE DIDN'T
SAY FROM HOW FAR AWAY.

186
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,390
HE HIT

187
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,390
FREE THROWS.

188
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,390
OKAY.

189
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,090
AND A
THREE-FOOT PUTT?

190
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,440
HOW MUCH

191
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,890
SHORTER COULD A PUTT BE?

192
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:09,780
MAYBE
HE WAS INSULTING HIM.

193
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,960
KIM-JONG
IL SHOT A 38 UNDER PAR.

194
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,080
GREAT LEADERS DO GREAT SPORTS.

195
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,130
STEPH CURRY/TOM BRADY FOR
PRESIDENT APPARENTLY.

196
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,480
CALVIN MURPHY.

197
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:32,820
A GUY WHO CAN WORK TO THE
HOOP.

198
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,260
PRESIDENT RICK BARRY.

199
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,870
THE TIRE
IS HERE -- WE COULD ALL THROW A

200
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:44,090
SPIRAL THROUGH IT.

201
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,810
I ONCE SAW HIM HIT A BALL RIGHT
OFF OF A TEE, IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

202
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:54,720
IT'S THE SAME MACHO BULLSHIT
TRUMP HAS, THAT'S HOW THEY BOND.

203
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,410
THEY ALSO BOND OVER BIG MONEY,
AND CLEARLY THEY BOND OVER

204
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,780
NOT CARING ABOUT ANYTHING THAT
MATTERS TO THIS COUNTRY.

205
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,740
SCARAMUCCI CRITICIZED MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS BECAUSE THEY WERE

206
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,250
GUYS WHO DIDN'T HAVE ANY REAL
MONEY.

207
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,740
AGAIN, WE HAVE AN ELITE,

208
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,550
OUT OF TOUCH GOVERNMENT UNDER
THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT

209
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,700
WE FOUND A WAY TO MAKE IT
CONSIDERABLY WORSE.

210
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,700
BOTTOM LINE

211
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,340
ON SCARAMUCCI IS, GUYS WITH
GOOD HAIR WHO GRADUATED FROM

212
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,560
TUFTS UNIVERSITY SHOULDN'T BE
TRUSTED.

213
00:11:31,560 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS A NEW RULE HERE FROM
TYT.
