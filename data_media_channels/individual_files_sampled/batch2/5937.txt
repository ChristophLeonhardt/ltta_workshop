it's so bizarre to see foreign leaders trying to talk to the president the way Newt Gingrich and Chris Christie do on TV yeah well he's smart to do that I mean I think McCrone has figured out how to manage Trump McCrone figured they figured out how to do that and you know he he listened to that I think he also liked the parade well he loved the parade and so look yes love the wife she was in great shape so you know he's playing him just the way but sure you're knee-deep in sort of our place in the world and the threats we face right now from Russia I mean I mean frankly McCrone and the French were stronger and keeping the Russians out of their democracy than we've been just you know you're a nap later and ours yes and they were smart because they actually listened to what was going on that they that the Russians had invaded us had attacked us and they took precautions and they actually you know did some jujitsu on the Russians were able to throw back some fake news back to them and and we're able to keep to preserve the integrity of their elections this president has not wanted to do anything in terms of securing the elections for whatever reasons whether he feels it makes them a legitimate or there are actual real ties to Russia which we will find out as time goes by is is astounding it's just astounded something else that's astounding to a lot of people is the idea that one this is the president's first state dinner I think George W Bush invited the leader of Mexico by the first summer of his presidency you covered the Bush administration I was at the funeral for Barbara Bush over the weekend and Melania Trump is every bit a traditional first lady representing this country at home and on the world stage but don't watch what not so much know the one traditional thing they're doing they're having it in the State Dining Room it's going to be much smaller than the dinners were under Democratic administrations when the Obamas would have a well I think the Republicans in general have smaller state dinners that I think the W's had smaller dinners invited only Republicans I mean even though there so that's a chart it's a shock to have no Democratic leaders of Congress no members of the media at all no no's years I can't I don't know if there we haven't heard yet if they're movie stars or you know cultural figures but it would be really rare I mean and quite insulting not to have the Democratic leaders of Congress what do you think well in part you have to think about what the symbolism of this isn't general you're bringing somebody on to United States turf the conversation shifts a little bit and just that he knows how to communicate with the president on Fox News he also knows how to communicate with this president because he's had a little bit of experience here and from the optimistic point of view think several world leaders that the president has interacted with on may be awkward way is there conflict with the more they start to have this kind of engagement and particularly here where there's a lot of symbolism involved and hopefully advisers are giving him the right advice of the right types of things that you should be talking about what you want to project us you're sort of a good ally that would be something positive to come out no but the fact that you pointed out that there are no Democrats there there are no members of the media there this is a president and I tweeted this today I mean he basically was not wanted the Kennedy Center Honors he is embarrassed and frightened to go to the White House Correspondents Dinner and he was not invited to a funeral of a first lady this is a president who can't show up at places and he's representing us on the world stage it's crazy he wasn't there mrs. mrs. Trump was very much welcome but but you pick up this this thread of sort of you know we might a little long and I don't think that we're guilty of normalizing anybody here is guilty of normalizing anything but but the Robert does meet the road when a portable heater comes to our country has to go in Fox News Sunday to convey a message I mean normally talks about the Iran deal happen in bilats where you sit next to your national security advisor they sit next to theirs and you have these serious conversations and whether there's agreement or disagreement that's how you communicate it is truly unprecedented to see a world leaders first sort of face pop up on Fox News well look at the infrastructure the National Security Council or the State Department or you know who are the interlocutors that President McConnell would deal with if you not Chris Wallace I mean that's the way to reach the president I mean who's he going to talk to at the State Department who's going to have the president's ear it's a really good question I said I think sometimes we stare at the wrong shot that you know we talked about state-run media I think it's a media run state I think you know I think we're sharing yeah we're staring at the wrong end of the looking glass hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
