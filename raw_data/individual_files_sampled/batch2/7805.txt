TYT is partnering with participant media to help solve the climate crisis will not be great now look you got to check out our series 10 days of action to learn more about what you can do to make a difference and go see any inconvenience equal truth to power in theaters in New York and LA on July 28th and nationwide August 4th following Donald Trump's decision to randomly and surprisingly ban transgender individuals from the military through a series of tweets people started questioning the medical cost that taxpayers essentially have to pay for when it comes to members of our military and also veterans and so Trump's argument was it's gonna be too expensive to take care of the medical procedures for these trans veterans when in reality it's only going to be a tiny tiny tiny fraction of what the Pentagon pays in health care costs and then people brought up the example of erectile dysfunction drugs and how the Pentagon actually does spend a considerable amount of money on that so just to give you the exact numbers the Pentagon's annual spending on erectile dysfunction medications is about 84 million dollars a year when it comes to transition-related health care for trans military members the rand Institute estimated that at most it would be 8.4 million dollars so again it's a tiny fraction of what they spend on erectile dysfunction drugs let alone what they spend on health care overall for our military members now keep in mind that they also have spent a whopping 294 million dollars on viagra cialis and other such medication since 2011 so so we're look we're spending a lot of money on making sure that you know our vets and our military get the stiffies that they need which is fine I actually have no problem with that okay because a lot of our members a lot of military members suffer from PTSD that leads to erectile dysfunction look we need to do right by our soldiers okay I think that's the right thing to do and I'm not gonna get in there and be like hey what are you doing are you taking a reptile dysfunction drugs am i paying for it right I don't want to get involved in their lives like that but you know the right does so yeah so just give me some perspective here look I believe in the troops rights to stand a post or to raise the flag and so I'm not trying to take that away from them but you can't complain about how expensive it is to provide health care for trans soldiers and then say something that's completely optional I mean I I know what you're thinking if you're a guy like I don't know the sex is optional eight okay I hear you brother but it's not life-saving it's not part of your identity and it's etc so I'm not trying to take it away from you yes it costs 10 times more right so it is not about the cost and and look that goes to the idea that that people bring up which is that yeah most of the lawmakers are our males so when it comes to viagra and all that stuff they just don't question it on like a of course of course we need erections no but this is monstrous person wouldn't want me to be able to get medication and pay for it that allows me to have babies but then when you turn around and Rush Limbaugh says if you want birth control you're a slut yeah why should why should health insurance have to pick up birth control which is a super tangential to Rush Limbaugh and whatever bills he pays for health care right right and look to be quite honest with you we put our soldiers through so much multiple deployments you know taking them away from their friends and their families multiple times just so they can go to these senseless wars in the Middle East and so they go through a lot not only physically but psychologically and so when it comes to you know psychological issues that they face of course PTSD is one of the biggest issues that in my opinion continues to go untreated they're still not being given the the resources necessary to combat that but hey you know what private contractors there's no problem signing contracts with them and making them wealthy while we you know essentially put our soldiers at risk just to give you numbers I want to read this because it's unbelievable so there was a study in 2014 by the Armed Forces health surveillance branch and they found that one hundred thousand two hundred forty two cases of erectile dysfunction function were diagnosed among active service members between 2004 and 2013 with annual incidence rates more than doubling in that time period so interesting so we've been escalating war you know in the Middle East and it's having a negative impact on them so look I'm saying all this because I again I don't want to get involved in their lives I don't want to tell them what drugs they can and can't take which should be covered which shouldn't be covered but I think the same type of respect should be extended to the trans community as well especially if they're gonna put their lives on the line to defend the country and one last stat for you guys in Donald Trump's just first 80 days okay not all the way through his administration the expenses that the American taxpayer had to pick up for just his optional trips to Mara Lago so that he can golf on the weekends something in credit credit sighs President Obama for was twenty million dollars so what about two and a half times what it takes to call to cover all trans people in the military all their health care needs so if you actually cared about saving taxpayers money if all you had to do is miss a couple of golf golfing outlets trips and then we'd be covered he doesn't care about the costs when it comes to him going and doing free as for mar-a-lago and golfing he doesn't he couldn't care less this is to discriminate and to get rile up his base and to do distraction it is the most obvious thing in the world so wait look we all know that it's not really about the cost but it seemed completely out of nowhere that he tweeted these things right and and we suspected that it was a distraction but I realized something last night after the show look he is aggressively attacking Jeff Sessions his Attorney General and the reality is the right-wing loves Jeff Sessions they love the fact that he's against immigration he's against amnesty he's just you know right-wing 101 he is the embodiment of what the right-wing loves and so if he's attacking Jeff Sessions this aggressively that might turn off his base a little bit right mm-hmm so how does he appeal to his base again he starts with the demagoguery again he starts talking about all these violent and dangerous immigrants he I don't know if you covered it but he recently did a speech about undocumented immigrants and he talked about ms-13 beheading people and just fear-mongering about them again he's appealing to his base by doing this nonsense it has nothing to do with cost it has nothing to do with policy he didn't even really think it through before tweeting it about it they say the Democrats do identity politics what is this this is identity politics don't worry I'll protect you from the scary trans community and and look if you're a trump supporter even you know it does not do what the cost you you know it for a fact and right now you're going yeah I know but those people shouldn't serve it's a distraction I don't want him in the foxhole but you know it's not about the cost and you know the Trump is lying about that
