bystanders watched in horror as a rented van was driven at speed from a busy street onto a sidewalk full of people shoppers commuters students and residents were among the victims he just went on the sidewalk he just started hitting everybody man he had every single person on the sidewalk anybody in his lady would I just think the Starks and I saw there's a white truck just go to the side sidewalk had so many people just shouting stop the car but he didn't just keep moving in this cellphone video alone policeman confronts the driver who waves an object perhaps pretending it's a gun he's heard to shout kill me kill me but the armed policeman didn't shoot and made an arrest in front of the van used to cause so much harm we are all collaborating and we're all putting our our pieces together to see exactly what we have and at this particular point in time there's nothing that does affect the national security footprint we are looking very strongly to what the exact motive or motivation was for this particular incident to take place and at the end of the day we will have a fulsome answer and we'll have a fulsome account as to what the conclusion if this is police say the suspect is a 25 year old student called Alec Minassian from north of Toronto he has no criminal record and it's not believed he's part of any larger plot involving national security Toronto's mayor is calling for unity and healing I hope that we will as a city remind ourselves of the fact that we are admired around the world for being inclusive and for being accepting and understanding and considerate and that we are united in standing in solidarity especially with those who have fallen victim to this terrible tragedy today a huge police investigation involving national security officials and other government agencies has begun a clearer picture of this attack may emerge soon but for now this is a city mourning the unexpected bloodshed that marred a beautiful day in the spring Daniel al-jazeera Toronto
