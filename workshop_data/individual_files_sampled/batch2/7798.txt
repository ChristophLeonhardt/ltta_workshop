SCOTT PRUITT'S WEEK OF SCANDALS DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE GETTING BETTER, SO THE QUESTION WE ARE LEFT WITH, WILL HE BE THIS WEEK'S 6 PM WEST COAST FIRING FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? WE CAN'T GO BACK THROUGH ALL THE SCANDALS BECAUSE APPARENTLY EVERYONE AROUND HIM WHO HAS DIRT ON HIM HAS DECIDED TO FLOOD THE MARKETPLACE WITH IT, BUT WE WILL TOUCH ON SOME OF THE BIG ONES SO THEY COULD PERHAPS LOOK INTO THAT. AND THERE ARE SO MANY, THERE'S THE FACT THAT HE'S GETTING THIS MASSIVELY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FROM SOMEONE WHERE HE'S PUSHING FOR THEIR CLIENTS, IT'S A HUGE QUID PRO QUO, A SHADY REAL ESTATE DEAL, HIS INSANE EXPENSES ON FIRST CLASS AIR TRAVEL SEEMINGLY FOR THINGS NOT RELATED TO HIS JOB, HE HAS MORE SECURITY THAN LEADERS OF MOST COUNTRIES, SOUNDPROOF PHONE BOOTHS AND OPPOSITION RESEARCHERS FOR THE MEDIA, ALL OF THIS STUFF. IT'S CAUSING A LOT OF PROBLEMS FOR HIM. NOW, HE DOES HAVE SOMEONE WHO APPARENTLY WANTS TO CLEAR THE WHOLE THING UP AND GET RID OF HIM THAT WAS EARLIER, AND SINCE THEN DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY TWEETED IN SUPPORT OF SCOTT PRUITT, SAYING I HAVE A BELIEF, MAYBE IT'S CRAZY, I THINK SOMEONE IN YOUR ADMINISTRATION TALKED TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY AS CORRUPT AS THE WHOLE THING IS. I DON'T THINK THEY MADE IT UP. SO KELLY WANTS HIM OUT AND TRUMP APPARENTLY DOESN'T WANT HIM TO GO SO IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A DISAGREEMENT AND PERHAPS THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT, THIS IS A REPORT AGAIN FROM SOURCES INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE THAT IS A TRIED AND TRUE STRATEGIES OF FIVE-YEAR-OLDS AROUND THE COUNTRY. BUT WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THAT IS THAT HE HAS SAID THAT THE CHIEF OF STAFF, AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT POSITION INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE, TRUMP DOESN'T WANT IT, HE WANTS TO ELIMINATE THAT AND DO THAT JOB HIMSELF, WHICH IS LITERALLY A SUBPLOT OF THE OFFICE. THAT'S WHAT DWIGHT DOES, HE BECOMES HIS OWN NUMBER TWO. DONALD TRUMP IS WATCHING TOO MUCH NETFLIX. EVERYONE SAYS WE WANT BUSINESS PEOPLE TO RUN THE GOVERNMENT, BUT IN DONALD TRUMP'S WORLD RUNNING A BUSINESS JUST MEANS DOING WHATEVER YOU WANT AND HAVING NO ONE WHO IS GOING TO CHECK YOU IN ANY WAY, NOT HAVING ANY KIND OF LEGISLATORS, ANY TYPES OF RULES THAT ARE GOING TO STOP YOU, BUT TO ME WHAT'S MORE FRUSTRATING ABOUT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY SCOTT PRUITT IS CORRUPT I KEEP WANTING TO CURSE AND THEN I REALIZE I CAN'T BUT IT'S ALL MOST LAUGHABLE HOW BAD HE IS, BUT IN THE MEANTIME HIS EPA HAS BEEN TRAINED TO PUSH THROUGH 22 WAYS OF DEREGULATING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS. SO THERE IS ACTUAL DAMAGE BEING DONE BY THE PERSON IN THIS POSITION, AND WHAT WE ARE SO FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY ABOUT AND THE REASON HE MIGHT GET KICKED OUT IS BECAUSE HE IS CORRUPT AND HE'S GETTING KICKBACKS ON HIS RENT. AND IN THE MEANTIME THOSE ARE GOING TO BE LIFE-THREATENING EFFECTS FROM THAT DEREGULATION. BUT ISN'T THIS JUST, YOU KNOW, SAME AS USUAL? GOING THROUGH THIS POLITICAL PROCESS EVEN FROM THE BEGINNING, WE SEE THE CORRUPTION OF MONEY EVEN JUST AS A CANDIDATE. IT STARTS THERE. OUR ENTIRE GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW, MOST OF THEM, AND I WILL SAY THIS VERY BOLDLY, I BELIEVE THEY ARE BOUGHT AND PAID FOR. I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING DOWN THE LINE, I'M SEEING IT EVEN WITH THE PEOPLE I'M RUNNING AGAINST. THEY HAVE TAKEN MONEY FROM CORPORATIONS AND THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DEFENDERS OF CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND CERTAIN INITIATIVES BUT YET THEY ARE TAKING MONEY FROM EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE, AND WE SEE THAT WITH PRUITT, EVEN IN SOME OF THE THINGS HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF. AND I SAY THIS REALLY IS STARTING JUST EVEN FROM THE BASIS OF OUR GOVERNMENT, AND THAT'S THE BASIC ELECTED OFFICIAL ON UP, AND WE ARE SEEING THAT. AND UNTIL WE START CHANGING THAT I THINK WE ARE CRAVING AN ENVIRONMENT FOR MORE JOHN KELLYS. IT REMINDED ME OF ONE LAST LITTLE ANECDOTE WHEN I WAS REMINDED OF HOW HE WANTED THE SIRENS PUT ON HIS CAR SO HE COULD SPEED THROUGH TRAFFIC FASTER, THAT REMINDS ME OF RUSSIA IN KIND OF THE 90S AND EARLY 2000 BECAUSE OF HER MEMBER ALL THE TIME GOING AS A KID TO VISIT FAMILY, YOU SEE ALL THESE BLACK CARS GOING BY WITH THE BLUE SIRENS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN DO IN A CORRUPT COUNTRY LIKE THAT, YOU THROW THE THING ON AND PASS EVERYONE BY. WHICH LEADS ME TO MY POINT, I WAS SURPRISED WHEN SCOTT PRUITT WAS IN TROUBLE FOR SO-CALLED CORRUPTION WHEN THAT IS CHILD'S PLAY COMPARED TO WHAT TRUMP DOES. NOT ONLY DOES HE OF COURSE SUPPORT PRUITT'S ACTIONS IN NOT BATTLING CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY, ETC., BUT THE $50 A NIGHT CORRUPTION WHERE HE'S STAYING IS NOTHING COMPARED TO TRUMP UNIVERSITY. AND AS WE REPORTED EARLIER IN THE WEEK IT'S OBVIOUS SOMEONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO PUT A HATCHET IN PRUITT'S BACK, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WAS TRUMP SO WHEN THE SPOKESPERSON CAME OUT YESTERDAY AND SAID WE ARE EVALUATING HIM AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, THAT'S WHEN I THOUGHT HE WAS DONE BECAUSE I THOUGHT TRUMP SENT HIM OUT TO GIVE HIM THE OLD SENDOFF, WE ARE EVALUATING, NOT SURE ABOUT IT, BUT IT TURNS OUT, NO, GUYS LIKE JOHN KELLY CLEARLY WANTED TO GET RID OF HIM, THEY WERE SOURCES FOR FOX NEWS, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, THE ONES CLEARLY THROWING ALL THIS DIRT ON HIM, BUT TRUMP APPARENTLY NOT INVOLVED. IN BY THE WAY IT'S TRUMP, HE COULD CHANGE HIS MIND EIGHT TIMES LATER TODAY. HE MIGHT BE LIKE HE'S GOOD, HE'S TERRIBLE, THEN ONE DAY HE WILL JUST BLURT OUT HE'S FIRED, AND HE WILL BE GONE. OR HE WON'T. MY GUESS IS THAT KNOWING TRUMP'S CHARACTER AND PRUITT'S CHARACTER, THEY PROBABLY GET ALONG WELL AND THAT'S WHY PRUITT WAS TRYING TO MOVE UP THE RANKS AND GET AN EVEN HIGHER POST IN THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT'S WHAT MADE OTHER PEOPLE ANGRY AND THAT'S WHY THEY LEAKED ALL THESE THINGS AGAINST HIM, BUT TRUMP MIGHT LIKE THAT. HE LIKES PEOPLE BATTLING AND PUNCHING EACH OTHER IN THE FACE AND DOING UNTOLD DAMAGE TO ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE HE'S AMUSED BY IT, HE'S KING JOFFREY. THE CULTURE IS SET AT THE TOP, AND ANY ORGANIZATION. IF YOU SET THAT TONE THAT'S HOW THE PEOPLE WORKING FOR YOU, WORKING WITH YOU, THAT'S HOW THEY ARE GOING TO ACT. WHEN HE SAYS SOMETHING, THERE IS SO MANY LAYERS TO IT. LIKE, HE SAYS HE HAS MY SUPPORT OKAY, THOSE ARE THE LAST WORDS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN YOUR ADMINISTRATION HEARD THE FOUR THEY WERE BOOTED, USUALLY WHILE ON THE TOILET. BUT I DO KNOW THIS, WHEN HE LASHES OUT AT THE MEDIA AND SAYS A STORY IS UNTRUE, YOU CAN BET EVERY CENT IT'S TRUE. MAYBE HE GETS THROWN OUT OF THE EPA, MAYBE HE DOESN'T, BUT I CAN SAY THIS, HE DEFINITELY WANTS HIM TO BECOME THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, THAT IS OBVIOUSLY HIS GOAL HERE. HE'S HATED SESSIONS IN THAT POSITION FOR A LONG TIME, EVERY MONTH OR SO HE REMEMBERS TO TAKE HIM OUT INTO THE PUBLIC SQUARE AND FLOG HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM IN THAT POSITION AND THIS TWEET IS PROOF OF THAT. WITH THE TOP ADMINISTRATION IT'S THE DEVIL YOU KNOW. THAT'S THE SCARY PART, SCOTT PRUITT LEAVES HERE, WHO MIGHT POP UP NEXT? HE ALREADY GOT JOHN BOLTON AS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR WHICH TO ME IS THE MOST TERRIFYING DEVELOPMENT WE'VE SEEN, SO WHO COULD POSSIBLY COME AFTER SCOTT PRUITT? FINALLY I WANT TO TURN TO JOHN KELLY BECAUSE I THINK IN TODAY'S NEWS THAT'S THE MOST INTERESTING PART, APPARENTLY HE ALONG WITH SESSIONS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WANT PRUITT OUT BECAUSE PRUITT IS TRYING TO MOVE UP AND CREATE ALL THIS DRAMA AND CAUSING TROUBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION, A SMART MOVE BY KELLY TO TRY TO GET RID OF THIS GUY BEFORE HE BLEW UP ON THEM, WHICH HE DID THIS WEEK. BUT THE MACHINATIONS AGAINST KELLY ARE MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE HE'S CHIEF OF STAFF, IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT POSITION ARGUABLY, THAT'S WHO DETERMINES WHO GETS TO SEE THE PRESIDENT AND WHO DOESN'T, THERE ARE A LOT OF KNIVES OUT FOR HIM BECAUSE HE'S BEEN BLOCKING QUESTIONER AND IVANKA TO SOME DEGREE, AND COREY LEWANDOWSKI, SO THEY ARE ALL AGAINST HIM. SO THE PRESIDENT DOING THIS CHILDISH THING OF I'M NOT GOING TO PUT YOU IN THE MEETINGS, THERE IS A TARIFF, I DIDN'T TELL YOU JOFFREY-LIKE, IT DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR KELLY. KELLY'S ALLIES ARE TELLING CBS NEWS THAT HIS RETREAT IS STRATEGIC. NO IT'S NOT, HE'S GETTING SIDELINED AND HE'S HUMILIATED AND EMBARRASSED. AS HE SHOULD BE, AS SHOULD ANYONE WHO IS WILLING TO WORK FOR THIS PRESIDENT. AND JOHN KELLY APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO ALLIES IS HOPING TO JUST MAKE IT ONE YEAR AND THAT WOULD BE IN JULY, I'M NOT SURE HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT. AND I THINK THAT KELLY IS IN BIGGER TROUBLE THAN PRUITT BECAUSE TRUMP DOES NOT LIKE NO. HE DOES NOT LIKE BEING TOLD THAT HE IS AN IDIOT. KELLY DOES NOT SAY THAT WAY BECAUSE HE IS A SMART GUY, HE GOES MR.PRESIDENT, THAT IS A SMART IDEA, BUT... AND HE PHRASES IT IN A MATURE WAY, BUT TRUMP DOES NOT LIKE THAT. HE JUST WANT TO GET RID OF HIM SO HE CAN GO BACK TO MAKE THE MESS THAT HE ENJOYS. HE IS LIKE, WHERE IS MY PLAY-DOH? SO KELLY'S DAYS ARE PROBABLY NUMBERED. IT IS AMAZING HOW EACH PERSON THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO SOME OF THESE VERY IMPORTANT POSITIONS, WHETHER IT'S EDUCATION, HOUSING, ON TOP OF THE ENVIRONMENT, EACH ONE HAS ALWAYS BEEN PUT IN THERE TO TOTALLY DISMANTLE IT FROM THE BEGINNING. THAT HAS BEEN THE AGENDA. I DO NOT THINK ANY OF THIS SHOULD BE A SURPRISE TO ANY OF US BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN HIS AGENDA FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, IT'S A TOTAL PRO CORPORATE STANCE AND THAT IS WHY WE EVEN SEE A LARGE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS ON BILLS THAT I AM ASTONISHED THAT WE HAVE ANY DEMOCRATS VOTING YES ON, THAT ARE VOTING YES ON THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING SURE THAT THOSE BILLS GET PASSED BECAUSE IT SUITS THE AGENDA OF WHAT WE HAVE NOW IN OUR HOUSE, AND ARE SENATE. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE IN AMERICA.
