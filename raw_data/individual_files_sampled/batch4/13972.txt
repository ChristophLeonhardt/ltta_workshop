so I wrote last week about the emptiness in our culture and in the hearts of many people in our culture which I think is at the root of our current suicide epidemic it also it's at the root of of pretty much all of our problems in our country we have we have fled from God we fled from meaning we've fled from purpose and we've embraced this kind of nihilism although we don't call it nihilism nobody would actually call it that anymore we use other words and phrases to kind of soften it up a little bit so we'll say things like you only live once and live your truth and those sorts of things but they all mean to communicate a nihilistic perspective on life people are told that there's only one life only one reality it has no meaning aside from what you assign to it and then the question is well what happens when you stop assigning meaning to it what happens when you stop finding meaning in it well our culture says if you don't assign it if you don't find it then it's not there because there is no objective meaning it's only what you find now after writing that piece I was on the plane home from home from Denver or I was speaking at the Western conservative summit which is a great event by the way and I was reading a collection of soldier isten writings this book right here which is a great book by the way I definitely picked this up and I flipped to a speech that he gave in 1993 this is after I just so happened to write on this subject and I was I was reading through this book and I flipped through a speech they wrote in 1993 I wanted to just pull this up because it speaks exactly to what we were what about what I was writing about what we've been talking about now it's not a coincidence that I happened to find that theme written about in a solider distant book because this is a theme that he talked about throughout his whole life that he kept going back to but the the the speech that he gave in 1993 who did he give this speech - okay he gave this to the International Academy of Philosophy and a speech is called we have ceased to see the purpose we have ceased to see the purpose I want to read a little bit from because I think it's really powerful he says we have allowed our wants to grow unchecked and are now at a loss where to direct them and with the obliging assistance of commercial enterprises newer and yet newer wants are concocted some wholly artificial and we chase after them in mass but find no fulfillment and we never shall the endless accumulation of possessions that will not bring fulfillment either modern Transportation has flung the world wide open to people in the West even without it modern man can all but leap out beyond the confines of his being through the eyes of television he is present throughout the whole planet all at the same time yet it turns out that from this spasmodic pace of techno soundtrack progress from the oceans of superficial information and cheap spectacles the human soul does not grow but instead grows more shallow and spiritual life is only reduced our culture accordingly grows poorer and dimmer no matter how it tries to drown out its decline with the din of empty novelties as creature comforts continue to improve for the average person so spiritual development grows stagnant Comfort brings with it a nagging sadness of the heart as we sense that the whirlpool of pleasures does not bring satisfaction and that before long it may suffocate us no all hope cannot be pinned on science technology or economic growth the victory of technological civilization has also instilled in us a spiritual insecurity it gets gifts enriched but enslave us as well all is interests we must not neglect our interests all is a struggle for material things but an inner voice tells us that we have lost something pure elevated and fragile we have ceased to see the purpose let us admit let us admit even if in a whisper and only to ourselves in the hustle of life at breakneck speed what are we living for so I guess I should just end it right there because soldier distance art is spoken so I can't really I can't really add to that and say anything more profound than what he already said but this is really the problem the problem is is is well it's twofold I think first we don't know ourselves okay we don't know who we are and second we don't know our purpose and I think a person has to know both of those things or he will be in despair and if we have a culture a country a nation a civilization of people who are confused on both of those points then you will have a civilization of despair and I think that we're living in a civilization of despair because we have a crisis of identity and a crisis of meaning I don't mean to keep throwing books at you but as I was thinking about this I wanted to do a video on it and then I remembered another book Kierkegaard the sickness unto death which is a very difficult one to it's not exactly a you know cover to cover Beach read type of book it's it's pretty heavy stuff but um the sickness unto death and carry already talked about he explains in the introduction that from the Christian perspective from the Christian understanding even a sickness that kills you does not really lead to death it is not a sickness unto death because death is only the sort of gateway into eternal life but if we reject this and if we see ourselves as only temporal then that is the sickness that leads to death to despair to destruction on the first page of the first chapters book jerker guard says a human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite of the temporal and the eternal of freedom and necessity and he goes on I won't read more than that but he goes on to say that basically argue that a man is in despair when he denies or rejects or gives up on one aspect of that synthesis so when when when we give up on the eternal and infinite and truly free aspects of our being and we don't see ourselves as spirit anymore you know we don't see we don't recognize that that part of the synthesis of our being then that's when we fall into despair because a man like that doesn't know himself and thus doesn't know his purpose and so he's in despair know yourself and know your purpose that's the point here I think as a culture we tend to fail on both counts so I want to let's just look at this one at a time so first know yourself know your identity it's no coincidence that the discussion of you know things like gender identity have have gripped ahold of the nation at the same time that the suicide rate clams through the roof it's no coincidence that trans quote-unquote transgender people have such an astronomically high rate of suicide I believe that for transgender people attempt suicide at a rate of about forty percent now the rate for the rate for the entire nation is climbing but the general rate for everybody is like four or five percent which is still high forty percent is just a shocking figure why why would you have 40% of people in a particular demographic cook attempt suicide it's not enough to say well you know I know I know the claim that what leftist will say is well it's because they're bullied now that I'm sorry that doesn't explain it there have been many groups of people who have fared much much much worse in society than modern-day quote transgenders do and yet they never attempted suicide anywhere near that rate I mean think about black people up until civil rights think about black people during slavery they certainly had it worse in terms of their liberties and their treatment in society than quote-unquote transgender people do yet actually what you find usually among persecuted groups in any country throughout history is you find actually the reverse effect you find that the suicide rate will actually go down most of the time in face in the face of real harsh persecution because there's this kind of resilience that is sparked but that's with transgenders 40% why well because I think Kierkegaard was on to something there's a profound despair that comes with not knowing who you are with not knowing your identity without Reckitt without when you don't recognize the synthesis there's a despair that comes and it seems like a lot of us are very confused on this point a lot of us don't know who we are even if we don't identify as a sex opposite from our physical one it seems like a lot of us still struggle with we don't know who we are and from there you get everything from gender identity to plastic surgery and and beyond I mean think even of the people who are I mean this manifests itself in so many ways think about the people who are obsessed with fashion trends and they have they have no identity of their own they they have no sense of themselves they just wear what everybody else wears they say what everyone else says they develop the same interests as everybody else they kind of fade into the collective and and the trends and the fashions everything it's more like camouflage for them because it's meant to blend them into their surroundings or think of all the people who call themselves super fans of sports teams or superheroes or sci-fi franchises or what have you I'm not talking about regular fans I mean I mean people who are utterly obsessed with some form of entertainment it's just it's their whole life it's the primary thing they care about and if you say anything critical of it around them they will lose their minds they there was a there was a national review writer a year or two ago who wrote a critical column about Star Wars and she got death threats for for insulting Star Wars now think about the kind of people that would send death threats because you don't like the fantasy make-believe movie that they like these are people who have no identity so they have just found one in this make-believe story think of you know to think of the proliferation of communities like everything is a community these days what whether it's your sexual fetish then if there's there's there's a there's a community for every sexual fetish there's a community for every obsession for every enthusiasm for every interest for every hobby no matter what it is you're part of a community of people who share that with you people look for their identity and their shared love for things and experiences and entertainments and then there's probably the worst symptom of our identity crisis as a culture maybe not the worst but still pretty bad one those who identify themselves primarily and mostly mainly first and foremost as Republican or Democrat now that there's anything necessarily wrong with having a party affiliation although I mean increasingly I do think there's something wrong with it actually but I'm not really talking about that I'm talking about people who have tailored their whole identity everything they think and believe according to what the party says or to what a politician says there's a very common phenomenon these days on both sides of the spectrum of people who you know they'll say one thing one day they'll say the next thing I'd totally opposite thing the next they're their principles change by the minute it seems according to what their party says to what their politicians say to what they're talking heads say they've lost all identity they are now nothing but a letter R or D they have no capacity to think or a reason beyond that you now this is all wrong I think I think if any chance at being a well-rounded happy person I need to have a clear understanding of myself of Who I am I need to have an identity that's rooted in something solid and unchanging so I have to know first that I'm a human being and that I'm a man this is the most basic physical form of identity that's my most basic physical identity and I've got to know that that's the starting point if I can't even get past that then there's just that there's no hope of me forming any kind of identity whatsoever so I've got to know that and then I have to know my identity it's sort of a deeper kind of level I have to know that I'm a child of God and then I'm a husband I'm a father all of these things this is really my idea that's my true identity it's that's really Who I am so if you were to ask me who are you what's your identity that's what I should say before I say anything else that and that's kind of the the trunk and those are the roots of my identity that's the roots in the trunk and then from there all the little branches and twigs and leaves and everything those are all the kind of superficial things that are also part of who I am but they don't matter that much so I'm a Ravens fan I like to read books written by dead Russian guys okay I make a mean pot of chili but I like five guys it's the best fast-food restaurant that's not gonna be debated by the way I'll do a separate video on that some other time so those are all things right those are all those are all in a sense part of who I am but they don't matter that much and you those are the branches the lit the leaves the twig you could come and chop those off those could fall off they could they could change you know they and it doesn't matter it won't change who I am I'll continue along being the same sort of person because my identity is rooted in something more solid more real more eternal than just my interests in my affiliations and my proclivities I think a lot of people today are they don't have roots and they don't have a trunk they're just a bunch of branches and twigs and leaves I think there are a lot of leaves being blown around detached and weightless and helpless because they have no identity a person who identifies themselves first and foremost by some interest of theirs or some proclivity that's just a leaf that person is nothing they've reduced themselves to just a leaf laying on the ground and they can easily be blown away second thing so we need to know who we are and then we need to know our purpose you know we need purpose some idea as to why we are here even if I Know Who I am now I need to know why I am and we're on going and this deep desire for purpose and for meaning that's what separates us from animals your cat doesn't consider these questions your cat never sits around thinking what what am i why am I where's all this headed the cat doesn't think that cat doesn't think anything you just can't just wants to eat use the litter box whatever knock your drinks over that's all your cat wants to do doesn't think about anything else that's what separates us from in it's also what separates us from machines I know atheists will talk about people as if we're just a bunch of biological machines they'll talk about us as if we are computers covered in skin basically but even the most advanced computer in the world doesn't desire meaning even the most advanced computer in the world could never want to be anything more than a computer they can't conceive of anything else computer has no desires whatsoever and can never develop them I know science fiction we like to think about what what if a computer ever becomes self-aware it will never happen it's impossible it cannot happen now we we want to be something more than flesh and bone and I think even some of this struggle with some of the struggles with identity people wanting to change their gender and so forth some of that I think is rooted in a real true and healthy desire that we all have to be more than what we physically are it's just that they have missed or they have wildly misdirected those desires but there is a fundamental desire there CS Lewis points to this as proof of God he points out that nature would never on its own create in itself a desire for something beyond itself if we are nothing but the result of natural processes we never would have developed the ability to think about those processes or analyze them or be skeptical of them or question them or pine for something beyond them you CS Lewis says that your the fact that I that I desire something beyond this world means that I was made for something beyond this world if there really is no God in the universe I never would have found out that there is no God because I wouldn't have the consciousness to know that there is no God so there's clearly some other component to the human person there there's something else in us something immaterial something that can't be grasped something that can't be seen and thus could never be transferred or programmed into a computer and that thing is consciousness self-awareness the capacity to make moral choices the ability to recognize and appreciate beauty the ability to love our souls in other words that's the thing that's the that's the the extra component that we have we have eternal souls and it's our souls that crave for truth and meaning and purpose beyond just this physical life our culture may tell us well live in the moment you got to just live in a moment enjoy the moment but nobody lives at the moment nobody just enjoys the moment nobody can in fact the only people who really live in the moment are the people who are in absolute despair and are on the edge of suicide a person right before committing suicide that is a person living in the moment that's what living in the moment looks like it looks like dying because that's what it is so really live in a moment is to despair of anything else but this moment you but those of us were not at that point we know that there's more to life than that we have always this sensation of movement know that we're rushing towards something Ford's tomorrow you know there's always another night always another morning just around the corner then a year and then ten years and we know that we're just barreling we're barreling at breakneck speed towards something towards death and then something so yeah we should enjoy the journey but our enjoyment of the journey really hinges quite significantly on what we are journeying towards doesn't I remember when when our twins were born and there were our first kids and they were born premature and there were health complications and they had some breathing trouble so they had to immediately be whisked away up to the the NICU and I remember when the nurses came down to get me and bring me up to the NICU to meet our children and I remember everything about that moment I remember walking through the hallway I remember the hallway I remember the elevator I remember the sights and sounds and smells I remember everything I remember even how it what it felt like the temperature in the building and I'm there was joy mixed with a lot of fear and anxiety and everything else but looking back on it now it's all joy to me now I remember it as as joy even that walk down the hallway I remember that walk down the hallway as moment of joy there was a kind of very short journey to my new life as a parent my point is that the journey was joyful was joy because the end was joined because I was going towards something joyful I was heading towards a new life but what if I'd been walking down a hospital hallway you what if instead of walking down a hospital hallway to greet my newborn children what if I was walking down that hallway to say goodbye to a dying child could you tell me to enjoy that journey tell me to live in that moment no I don't want to live my moment I'd rather die in that moment but you can't say that because I know where the journey ends in that case I know where it's leading and it's leading to despair and death and just emotional ruin so there's no way to enjoy that journey there's no way to live in that moment without dying in it the point is that our ability to enjoy the moment and to enjoy the journey depends very much on the end on the destination if we believe or we've told ourselves that the destination is eternal nothingness if we believe that we're hurtling towards obliteration and the cessation of our being then what joy can there really be in life how could you possibly enjoy life especially a life that unavoidably is going to involve so much suffering and sadness and suddenly in that case it all becomes a cruel joke our consciousness our ability to understand the joke is itself the worst joke of all nature in that case has put all the creatures on the earth on a path to decay and and final death and the obliteration of their beings and their essence but then it gave human beings the knowledge of this fact if that's the case then we got the raw deal didn't we we should look with envy on beasts and bugs because at least they can just live their lives and not think about it but this idea that nature created consciousness in a human being just so that we could spend our lives dwelling on the nothingness and pointlessness of the very existence that it granted us I mean that is that view of life is just it's it's it is pure unadulterated black despair that's what that is that's what that view of life is and if you look at life that way you know you look at bugs and dogs and cats and you might think I'd like to be one of them but you can never be them but it's very hard for us to live with with with the knowledge of the futility of our existence and the pointlessness of it and so then we begin to think that maybe the second best alternative is just to get it over with already that's the result of a life lived without a sense of purpose or destination but if we embrace our true purpose to believe in that destination and the God who created us for it um if we know our meaning and our purpose and our identity and our substance then we've opened ourselves up so for joy and hope that's the only way that's the only way to live as a person it's also the only way to function as a society and as a culture is with that sense of meaning and purpose and the great thing is that to have this sense of identity and purpose it not only is the best path to joy it's also the only path to truth it's also true it's even I would say self-evidently true that there is more to life than just there's more to me than just this the very fact that I can contemplate this and wonder about it for something more is proof that there is more because nature would not create a desire which is doomed to just be eternally frustrated that doesn't make any sense that that's not in keeping with the Darwinian theory of things so it's best we become more functional and more joyful when we have identity and purpose and it's also true that we have identity and purpose so that's that's I think the really good news here that is the good news right in the entire universe that's the good news is that there's more there's more than this alright thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed
