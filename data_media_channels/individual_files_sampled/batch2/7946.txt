The Wall Street Journal is reporting that a Trump lawyer had arranged a whopping $130,000 payment to a former adult film star who had what's alleged to be a sexual relationship with Donald Trump back in 2006 now this payment was meant to be hush money however Donald Trump's camp the administration is completely denying it they're saying this is old news it's completely false we'll give you the details and you can decide for yourself now again this was reported by The Wall Street Journal Wall Street Journal at least its editorial board has been rather pleasant to Donald Trump so this isn't you know some liberal news organization trying to mess up trump's administration but apparently there were two leakers or there were leakers i don't know exactly how many who spoke on the condition of anonymity these are individuals who knew about the deal that took place who knew about the payment and settlement that took place and here are the details that we know so far Michael Cohen who spent nearly a decade as a top attorney at the Trump Organization arranged this payment to the tune of $130,000 to the woman Stephanie Clifford in October of 2016 after her lawyer negotiated the non-disclosure agreement with mr. Cohen the alleged relationship took place back in 2006 and in an effort to squash any opportunity that she might have to go public with this information they decided to allegedly pay her this money this hush money very close to the election one month before the election so her stage name is stormy Daniels and according to The Wall Street Journal stormy Daniels has privately alleged the account the encounter with mr. Trump took place after they met at a July 2006 celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe Trump actually had married Melania Trump in 2005 and this alleged relationship occurred soon after she gave birth to their son mr. Cohen didn't address the $130,000 payment but said of the alleged sexual encounter that quote President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has Miss Daniels now this is different from other allegations that were lodged against Trump during his election remember there were a number of women who came forward and said that there was a non-consensual sexual misconduct happening and those accusations unfortunately just got brushed under the rug in this case they're alleging that there was a consensual sexual encounter between MS Clifford and Donald Trump honest with you guys when it comes to adults engaged in a consensual situation I don't care about infidelity that's none of my business none of my business right if it's not impacting me in any way why should I care why should I get involved but for me the reason why this is relevant is because there seems to be a pattern right of let me pay this person off hush money hush money and I'm concerned about possible bribery that could happen a possible extortion that could happen with other you know foreign governments and things like that you know what I'm saying like I feel like this is a character flaw that should be considered well it wasn't this also something that he held against Hillary Clinton for Bill Clinton's adventure he accused him of extortion and and giving hush money to other women that he was in consensual relationships with as well so again this comes calling back the same thing that accuses somebody else he himself has done before so I think that to me is you know the most minded not yours yeah yeah the action and you know it's become so commonplace with Trump in this administration that when hypocrisy happens I mean we're desensitized to it they have normalized it and so yeah you're right I remember you know during the election the stuff going around Bill Clinton being a rapist mind you you know not soon after that there were the accusations against Trump and the sexual misconduct there was the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged about groping women and so and then and yeah and Jessica Drake saying at the same exact event he forced himself on her kissed her without her consent and she can come forward to receive any amount of money she just did it because she felt like she needed to to expose him and also like the irony that Ivanka Trump would retweet oh yeah times up to say yeah let's come together and fight this and fight the basis of this movement in this campaign to eradicate sexual harassment gender inequity she could just like turn her head and find the first person to start like I brought the kid I don't know why Ivanka Trump keeps putting herself in that situation because is it because she lacks any and all self-awareness I don't know but I feel like much like her father she doesn't stop to think about the ramifications or the response that she's gonna get in regard to those types of tweets anyway so Trump says so many things that contradict each other you project some kind of sense on to it no vodka says so little yeah that you project some kind of cohesive meaning to it all like that's what I have no idea what she's like I want to like her because I need someone in that family who's a voice of reason for my own sanity that's that's the difficult thing with Ivanka it drove me crazy when I saw the me to thing it's just like well times I'll tell your dad yeah exactly another example is how Melania Trump's you know mission is to combat bullying and so it just shows a lack of self-awareness and I don't mean that Melania Trump is a bully actually to be quite honest with you Melania Trump has been the winner in in this presidency and mostly because she doesn't want any part of it so I think she's just kind of staying it makes sense if stormy Daniels paid Trump a hundred and thirty thousand dollars not to brag about having sex with her don't tell anyone I say near you you're aggro see I don't get it but like with these these non-disclosure agreements I'm part of me goes like stormy Daniels you get your money if even if you came out at that time in that way you two having a consensual relationship is way better sadly then the actors Hollywood tape which we all did see and didn't end up with right right but the reason right but then you have to ask yourself why did his lawyer who called himself I'm the mix mr. Fixit guy you decide that it was imperative to pay her off and to pay her off that amount months before the election what type of tidal wave that could start right I mean because she she knows if he likes the pp oh geez okay just saying I don't know it's just so if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
