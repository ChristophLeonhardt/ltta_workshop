Michael Newman here with us today<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

2
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">fight sports and entertainment he's also</font>

3
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,760
an advocate professor at Columbia

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Michael is Tiger going to be tainted</font>

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,180
forever I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> this going to blow over</font>

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and as soon as the pga tourney starts</font>

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,859
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think he'll forever be associated</font>

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,830
with this scandal but over time it's

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,679
going to lessen like it has with other

10
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,520
athletes and celebrities that have

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,649
associated themselves with scandals that

12
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,050
have happened you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kobe Bryant's</font>

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,329
history<font color="#CCCCCC"> michael vick is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not in the news</font>

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,190
anymore exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the most</font>

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,379
important thing right now is he has to

16
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,590
take a position and be accountable for

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">what happened and put himself in the</font>

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">public eye and make a statement and then</font>

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,980
lay low come back to the tour in 2010

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,260
and get back to doing what he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,670
good at and that's winning golf

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,199
tournament and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he starts</font>

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,420
winning and he starts getting back into

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the into play i think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of this</font>

25
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,650
stuff is going to start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> blow over so</font>

26
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,150
obviously he's made a public apology on

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,710
his website do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think he needs to do</font>

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,119
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mean this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like going</font>

29
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,700
on Oprah I absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> think he needs to</font>

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">do more he does really need to take a</font>

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,409
position he needs to define himself he

32
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,619
needs to let everybody know exactly how

33
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,390
he's feeling and he is going to need

34
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">some time away from from his fans and</font>

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,909
from the tour and also from from press

36
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,509
as far as going on Oprah that's a

37
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,250
possibility it really depends what his

38
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,049
objectives are the one thing that I'm

39
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,960
interested in learning is his PR and

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,960
communications strategy I'm not really

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,630
sure they still have a plan from what I

42
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,939
heard they weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite sure exactly</font>

43
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,280
what information was still really out

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,110
there so it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create a strategy</font>

45
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,420
and a plan to really define yourself if

46
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,700
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have all the facts well I mean</font>

47
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">their various I mean it's driven more</font>

48
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,509
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think than michael jackson's</font>

49
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,399
death on yahoo so obviously the public

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,899
is very interested there's a ton of

51
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,170
stories out there I mean given what we

52
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,360
have now what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> he need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and</font>

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,860
what is this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame and I mean the</font>

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,569
PGA

55
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,519
tournament starts or the tour starts in

56
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:16,129
January what can you do from now until

57
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:19,370
then well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

58
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">statement I think he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold a</font>

59
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:22,400
press conference I think he<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to</font>

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a statement and I think he needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

61
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,530
not so much explain what he did but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

62
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,810
come forward admit the mistakes and just

63
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask everyone for some privacy now while</font>

64
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,750
he starts to work on rebuilding his

65
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,819
image and potentially repairing this

66
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,500
relationship with his wife I'm not

67
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,499
really sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's going to be</font>

68
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:44,629
capable<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing that if you you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

69
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,790
you've read the newspapers a lot of the

70
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,250
text messages and emails have talked

71
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">about his level of unhappiness in his</font>

72
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">marriage that's got to be tough for his</font>

73
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:56,810
wife to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear of course in your opinion</font>

74
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it close to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being the biggest or most</font>

75
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:03,680
publicized sports scandal well in my

76
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">opinion a sports scandal is when the</font>

77
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:08,810
outcome impacts the game again so i look

78
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,030
at the 1919 World Series I look at what

79
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,799
major league baseball's dealing with

80
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:14,000
right now with performance-enhancing

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,409
drugs I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just shocking</font>

82
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:20,090
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else comes</font>

83
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,009
forward and announces a relationship

84
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:24,560
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tiger there's almost this shocked</font>

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,620
and awed reaction from the media and

86
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,790
from fans if this were<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen to a</font>

87
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,799
neighbor of yours and we were to learn

88
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,109
that this type of activity was happening

89
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:38,150
and we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> no idea what's happening I</font>

90
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,189
think we'd feel the same way this is all

91
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:41,629
just heightened because we're talking

92
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:44,479
about a curable iconic athlete like

93
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,699
Tiger Woods great thank you you're

94
00:03:46,699 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">welcome</font>
