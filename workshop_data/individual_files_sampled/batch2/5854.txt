do you and the president's attorneys believe the president has the power to pardon himself he is not but he probably does he has no intention of pardoning himself but he probably can't well here Rudy Giuliani is back on TV today making some interesting claims about his bosses pardoning power back with me are EJ Dionne Jennifer Rubin and Michael Steele I don't know if you could see my face after laughter that side but what is your reaction to that that the president's lawyer and I just wouldn't be specific television lawyer is out there saying the president's not talking about pardoning himself who says he can't what kind of talk is this Wow coherence I mean this is maybe he's working on his you know insufficient legal defense argument for the retrial or for the appeal but this is all over the lot and I think we in the media need to stop taking Rudy Giuliani either literally or seriously he says whatever he comes into his head or whatever the president suggests he says to throw up dirt and to pump up his wackadoodle base and this is of the peace listen if the president could pardon himself if the president could dismiss every officer of the executive branch he could commit murderer even before he got to the White House and get away with it so this is not the system we had this was the system King George had but that's not what the system that the American huh Michael yeah it's not the system we had and I agree with that but I I I've went on the record earlier this week and said that a lot of this what we're seeing with these pardons in the way the president's playing this out that's the ultimate end game here for this president so I don't dismiss what Rudy says lightly I don't laugh at it I don't scoff at it because if you haven't learned anything about Donald Trump you probably should have learned this that he doesn't give a damn about convention he's not prepared to follow your rules yeah so who says he kitten if he couldn't at the if he gets in that crucible moment where it's him or you know tradition and what the law says or doesn't say you know who's gonna side with so I got to take it seriously and I think look at it in a way that if you want to disrupt the system you won't disrupt it any better than the president taking that type of an action and throwing the country into a constitutional crisis as he moves on to something else right that's exactly that's exactly that is exactly it as long as you remember that President Trump thinks of himself as Donald Trump not President Donald tranq'd then everything he that has happened and will happen will make sense EJ know that's exactly right and that's what's genuinely scary about this a lot of us have been talking about his autocratic tendencies and the dangers that he is going to take powers that others other presidents didn't think of including by the way Richard Nixon among them and if you look at that letter from his earlier pre TV Giuliani lawyer lawyers what you see is a claim of presidential power that's staggering it's as if Donald Trump can do anything he wants to push one investigation along stop another and then the other thing about Giuliani today is he basically said yeah that story the administration put out on the meaning of that Donald Trump jr. meeting yeah that wasn't true I mean you have a lie that's useful earlier that's discarded later and we're not even supposed to pay attention to the fact that what happened earlier was a straight out lie this is really troubling right go ahead Jennifer and then we're in a place that more importantly about that EJ is right that is absolutely key and the reason is is that they have now confessed to obstruction of justice they said not only was there a false cover story but that the president dictated it so now we have a fully presented issue do you believe the president can obstruct by coming up with a phony cover story to put out to defend his son who is currently part of an investigation that is obstruction and I don't know what legal theory they're using or what strategy they're doing but I think Muller is going to use that and I think there is a point at which it really does not matter what his base says I think Muller is working in his basement methodically clearly he's going to come out I there with a recommendation for impeachment or he's going to recommend that the operative OLC memos not really apply and try to indict him so at some point you run out these TV options and there is a little reality there one part of the strategy is whether the president should sit down and talk with special counsel Muller let's take a listen to what Rudy Giuliani had to say about that so you're still recommending he does not sit down to the interview Jay and I want to keep an open mind and I have to just be honest I mean with leaning toward not they want to keep an open mind seriously they don't want him to sit down well this is all this is all theater right now right Michael it's total theater its total theater there's no way in hell president Trump sits down with anyone related to the Moller team especially not Muller himself to have a conversation about his words and actions during the campaign and subsequently as president it's not happening don't don't go down that rabbit hole folks and start believing that you know the president's trying to be honorable and aboveboard about this the president may articulate he wants to do it because he thinks he's smarter than everybody in the room and can handle it but everybody else in the room who knows him then you can't handle this so what happened Oh a lawyer doesn't worry about his or her client walking into a perjury trap unless they are worried that their client will commit perjury and that's what that's all about and everything else I think is just commentary right so EJ Jennifer let me come to you with this if you know the answer to this question what happens if we get to a situation where the president doesn't sit down with Muller and Muller ends up subpoenaing him are we in uncharted territory at that point not quite because this did happen with Richard Nixon they remember the tapes were subpoenaed and that's how the case got to the Supreme Court was whether the President had to comply in that case it wasn't for a deposition or an interview it was for production of evidence and the Supreme Court said you know what the president does not have a unlimited executive privilege he does have to cooperate there was a unanimous decision conservatives liberals on the court and they held and they handed that down now Richard Nixon complied with that order the question is if that happens again will trump comply with a order of the Supreme Court I think at that point he has to where we really are into impeachment zones but I think ultimately this does wind up in the courts I think I am less sanguine than his lawyers and a lot of his defenders that he has any defense here but the combination of the Nixon case and the Paula Jones case made it very clear that the president has to submit to a criminal ongoing criminal justice probe if he has evidence and he certainly does because his lawyer just admitted that he did a statement a lying about a meeting in Trump Tower what Michael to Jennifer's point given what you said said earlier and what I agreed with which is you know they attend on 'old Trump is all about Donald Trump if the Supreme Court comes down with it orders as mr. president you have to honor this subpoena and he says no because he has actually had the gumption to say no to the Supreme Court Donald Trump yes I think he would and I think you'd find a lot of his sycophants around him scrambling to justify his saying no that that then gets to the to the nub of this which is where Republicans in the certainly in the house don't want it to go is it that it then goes to Capitol Hill and Republicans on the hill have to decide at that moment do you stand with the Constitution of the United States so do you stand with Donald Trump equation and as things stand right right now do those folks on Capitol Hill have enough guts to stand up for the Constitution as opposed to the president of their own party to vote them out my bed as you look there look at that 86% number that we talked about in the last hour and they go I'm gonna hang in this corner as long as it's possible and that's the unfortunate part about all of this EJ and the worst separation of powers can cover a multitude of sins and I am sure they would do a lot around that and a gentle lawyer and I'm not but in terms of litigation of this it was litigated on the tape I don't think we've ever actually had a straight-up case of sue peening Tara testimony because Clinton got a kind of around that by making a deal with Ken Starr in the civil case there I think Jenner I'm inclined to agree with Jennifer's conclusion that the two are logically linked but it would be very interesting to see what a conservative Supreme Court does with a case like this and you know what we're gonna have to leave that question for another day in another panel but you guys are saying with
