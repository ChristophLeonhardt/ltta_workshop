Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in New York and for decades it stood in the shadows of the World Trade Towers until September 11th 2001 when the towers fell the debris crushed the church we stood there frozen paralyzed and crying Saint Nicholas was the only place of worship destroyed on 9/11 the whole history of hundred years records icons other archives but also the memories of those that were christened there those that were martyred there those that were visited the church the Greek archdiocese vowed to rebuild st. Nicholas at the very World Trade Center site and this video animation shows their big plans a new church and towering shrine made from marble and glass inspired by the Byzantine churches of Istanbul famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava was hired to design the new church he also designed the oculus structure at the World Trade Center site and then something happened work on the project suddenly stopped so the question becomes why the budget balloons to nearly 80 million dollars double what the archdiocese had raised now there's simply no money left to finish the project a plastic tarp now covers the construction site there are no signs of workers and no signs of the doors opening anytime soon the cost reduction stopped because the original cost unfortunately were not accurate we had a huge cost overarm but as tourists visit the 9/11 memorial site off to the side most are oblivious to the construction site of the church the grand she remains unfinished with nobody able to say for how much longer Gabriel is Ando al Jazeera New York
