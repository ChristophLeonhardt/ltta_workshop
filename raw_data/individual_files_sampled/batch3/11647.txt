worried butchers have sent a letter to the French president Emmanuel macron in a bid to prevent more violence this is a civil war this can go on mr. president should our workers take up arms to defend themselves and their businesses meanwhile butchers have already gained some support from officials with the head of the Republican Party saying 200,000 euros in compensation will be paid out to those affected so we got reaction from both sides of this clash there aren't see me old very meta no the incident happened around 3:00 in the morning I came down and saw that the door had been hit in three places they also painted its top species here on the aluminium I took pictures immediately here oh the police arrived I will show you what it okay that yeah here is the picture of the damage do these are the marks on the aluminum aluminum and here's where it says stop speciesism and these are the rocks they used to smash the glass yeah I believe these people should be punished why don't they attack large corporations obviously they only attack small businesses people will continue eat why does everybody have us start eating vegetables only because these activists want them everyone has their own preferences and we must respect the choices legality more risky though these activists think that animal rights must be protected similarly to human rights that is why they believe it's immoral to kill animals for food so it's not surprising that they attack slaughterhouses and butchers shops they think that morality is more important than obeying the law if the law authorizes immoral acts then they think what they do is justified in terms of morality anything that may stop the killing of animals for meat is acceptable but I am not sure whether illegal actions are the best way to promote animal rights the question we should ask ourselves is whether it is an effective way to raise awareness about animal suffering and animal rights if it's a good strategy then we should do it but I am not sure about it at all you
