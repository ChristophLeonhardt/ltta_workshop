COMES IN THE WAKE OF SEVERAL MAJOR LEAKS THAT IF WHITE HOUSE HARD AND SENT THEM SCRAMBLING ON DEFENSE TO PUT AN END TO THIS FLOW. A MAN JOINING ME NOW, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER. ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE UPCOMING BOOK, THE BRIEFING, WHICH WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO TALKING TO HIM ABOUT AS WELL. WHILE MATT, SEAN. PEOPLE USING THE MEDIA TO SHE SHIV SHIV EACH OTHER. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME PEOPLE WHO WILL GET FIRED. MIGHT ONCE HAVE STARTED TO HEAL SO I FEEL PRETTY GOOD. SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IT'S AN ABSOLUTE HONOR TO BE ABLE TO WORK AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND SERVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HELP IMPLEMENT THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA AND ANYBODY WHO GOES THERE AND LEAKS REALLY UNDERMINES BOTH THE HONOR THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BESTOWED UPON THEM AND THE AGENDA THAT THE PRESIDENT IS PURSUING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I THINK KELLY ANNA'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. ANY UNAUTHORIZED LEAKS INFORMATION Martha: THIS IS LIKE A YEAR AND A HALF. ALL THE CYCLES OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT AND THEN JOHN KELLY WAS BROUGHT IN. THIS WAS GOING TO STOP THE LEAKS. ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI SAID HE WAS GOING TO STOP THE LEAKS. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? HOW TOUGH IS IT TO RUN A TIGHTER OPERATION? PEOPLE HAVE VERY INGENIOUS WAYS THESE DAYS, ENCRYPTED APPS, ET CETERA TO GO AFTER EACH OTHER BUT I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU'VE GOT A MEDIA THAT'S WILLING TO TAKE ANY STORY THAT COMES FROM ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO AS KELLY AND PUT IT, SHIV THEIR FELLOW EMPLOYEES SO THAT THERE IS A WILLING AUDIENCE TO GET RETRIBUTION OR UNDERMINE SOMEONE ELSE'S AGENDA AND SCORE POLITICAL PETTY POLITICAL POINTS IF THEY DON'T WANT TO UNDERMINES MODELS ON THE TEAM. I THINK THAT'S SAD, THAT'S WRONG AND I THINK KELLY AND AS I MENTIONED IS RIGHT. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CAUGHT DOING THAT UNDERMINE WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS WORKING HARD TO DO AND DISTRACT FROM HIS ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT AND DRIVE A MESSAGE THAT CARES ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. Martha: THE BIG ONE THIS WEEK WAS THIS WOMAN AND WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT JOHN McCAIN, VERY HEARTLESS COMMENTS AND I GUESS SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T LIKE HER SHIVVED HER AS KELLY AND SAID. WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAPPEN TO HER? I'M NOT PRIVY TO THE INFORMATION THAT HAPPENED OR EXACTLY WHAT DID BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS, SENATOR MCCAIN AND ANYBODY WHO HAS SUFFERED FROM ANY OF THESE HORRIFIC DISEASES SHOULD HAVE OUR UTMOST SYMPATHY AND PRAYERS. REGARDLESS OF THE CONTEXT THAT IT SET IN, I BELIEVE AS A CATHOLIC THAT IF WE MAKE A MISTAKE, WE ASK FOR FORGIVENESS AND WE FORGIVE. IF IT WAS SET I WOULD IMPLORE HER TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS AND THOSE WHO WERE HURT BY THAT, TO EQUALLY GIVE THE FORGIVENESS. BUT RIGHT NOW OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH SENATOR MCCAIN AND ALL THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM DISEASES THAT ARE TAKING AWAY FROM THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE A NORMAL AND HEALTHY LIFE. AND SO I WISH WE COULD GET OVER THIS IN A WAY THAT HONORS SENATOR MCCAIN AND EXPRESSES OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY. Martha: I HEAR YOU. I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT. THIS IS JOHN KELLY, THE CHIEF OF STAFF, ON NPR. IN RETROSPECT, I WISH I HAD BEEN HERE FROM DAY ONE. HOW SO? IN TERMS OF STAFFING OR SERVING THE PRESIDENT, THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WAS PRETTY CHAOTIC. THERE WERE PEOPLE HIRED THAT MAYBE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIRED. IT'S NOT THAT THINGS WERE A DISASTER THAT FIRST SIX MONTHS, BUT I BELIEVE THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. Martha: DO YOU THINK, TAKE THAT PERSONALLY I GUESS IS THE FIRST QUESTION AND DO YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF HE HAD BEEN THERE FROM THE BEGINNING? I HAVE A TON OF RESPECT FOR GENERAL KELLY KELLY AND HS GENERAL KELLY KELLY AND HR GENERAL KELLY KELLY AND HI GENERAL KELLY KELLY AND HE GENERAL KELLY KELLY AND HT GENERAL KELLY KELLY AND HO OUR COUNTRY. I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND JUST SAY THAT THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WE HAD A DISRUPTER COMING INTO THIS WHITE HOUSE WHO HADN'T SERVED IN POLITICS BEFORE. HE WASN'T A POLITICIAN. HE BROUGHT IN A TEAM THAT REALLY WAS ABLE TO SHAKE THINGS UP AND WE HAD SOME BUMPY ROADS BUT WE DID A LOT TO SUCCEED FOR THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS AGENDA. I'M PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE DID OVER THOSE SIX MONTHS AND I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD STOP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST AND FOCUS ON THE FUTURE AND WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE AND MAKE EVERYONE LIVE A BETTER, HEALTHIER AND MORE PROSPEROUS LIFE. Martha: WITH REGARD TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF, GENERAL KELLY, HE'S OFF ON THE SUBJECT OF LEAKS, ABOUT THINGS HE SAID AND THEN HE HAS TO APOLOGIZE FOR THEM. WHO IS AFTER HIM IN THE WHITE HOUSE? WHO IS PUTTING THIS OUT THERE? I WILL TELL YOU THIS, I GENERALLY I WOULDN'T WANT TO CROSS A MARINE, NEVER MIND A FOUR STAR REMAIN. I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOT THE GUTS TO DO THAT BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT A SMART MOVE BECAUSE THEY THINK OF GENERAL KELLY FOUND OUT THEY WOULD LAST ABOUT TWO SECONDS OF THE WHITE HOUSE. I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING PEOPLE WHO WEEK ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOSING AN ARGUMENT OR WANT TO UNDERMINE THE PERSON THAT'S WINNING THE ARGUMENT OR UNDERMINE THEIR AUTHORITY SO I THINK GENERAL KELLY WAS BROUGHT IN TO BRING SOME DISCIPLINE AND ORDER TO A WHITE HOUSE AND I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE PROCESS THAT HE HAS LAID OUT ARE PROBABLY TRYING TO UNDERMINE THAT. Martha: DO YOU HOPE HE STAYS? I HOPE THAT IF THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS, BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY I WANT THE PRESIDENT THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA TO SUCCEED. I THINK GENERAL KELLY HAS DONE A GREAT JOB AS CHIEF OF STAFF AND IF YOU DO PRESIDENT AND HE WANT TO KEEP GOING TOGETHER THAT'S GREAT. THEY ARE TOUGH JOBS. IT'S EXTREMELY INTENSE AND I THINK IT'S A MUTUAL DECISION THAT BOTH OF THEM HAVE TO HAVE GOING FORWARD BUT AS LONG AS THE PRESIDENT WANTS HIM AND HE WANTS TO STAY I THINK IT'S A GREAT COMBINATION SO FAR. Martha: YOU BEEN WRITING A BOOK ABOUT YOUR TIME, THE BRIEFING. I ASKED YOU WHEN YOU WERE IN THE BREAK IF YOU HAD NEED PTSD WHEN YOU WERE WRITING THE BOOK AND
