hi black people did you ever wonder why some white people have become your allies in the fight against white privilege and are helping you in your attempts to repair past and justices well it's because they despise you and don't care if you have unhappy lives as long as they feel good about themselves trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is what yes black people in the news media on college campuses in government and all the other bastions of insincerity and self aggrandizement across America you can find white allies pinkish lis coloured creepiness Gumby's wearing found faces to show you just how much they mind their white privilege means gormless numpty dumps want to tilt the playing field of life in your favor because they look down on you and want to feel virtuous while making sure you won't be able to compete with them or their children think about it logically well pretend you're not a Democrat now think logically if these stinky cheese chuckleheads respected you as equals they would expect you to compete against their own best efforts in spite of any residual bigotry just as every other race has done in American history instead white allies condescend to you as if you were cripples or children not because they're hypocritical racists oh no wait that is why sorry wait allies pay elaborate respect to destructive groups like black lives matter and blithering posers like Cornel West and by elevating these individual whiners to success they ensure the failure of all the black people who follow them BLM and West use murky racist generalizations to suggest that people of color are helplessly crushed beneath white oppression in modern America and therefore require entitlements and special race-based treatment in order to compete such seemingly charitable solutions allow quite a nice to feel compassionate while blacks descend into continual dependency perpetual outrage and perennial bitterness a certain recipe for a crap life white allies in the press aided race activists as they relentlessly vilified tough policing techniques that made black neighborhoods safer allies in government help perpetuate the fiction of anti-black mortgage redlining a fiction which led to subprime loans and a financial crash that were especially disastrous for african-americans white allies in academia defend black uv's when they dress like prison thugs or listen to music that encourages violence and degrades women as if the color of their skin made such demeaning behaviors obligatory what would a real white Ally of black people look like let's put on our imagination caps and find out hey that looks like nevermind let's listen in hey black people stop complaining no one's gonna give up his privilege for you even if they put on a sad I'm so privileged face and pretend they will no one can erase the sins of the past or remove their effects on the present there is no race-based policy or idea that will improve your life not one your equal to anyone so tough as it is ask only to be treated as an individual responsible for yourself you'll be well and your kids will do even better Wow so that's what a real white Ally would look like I'm Andrew Clavin with live wire
