I'LL BE MEETING WITH KIM JONG UN IN THE COMING WEEKS. Harris: LOVE FROM SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA. GREG. NO MORE WAR WITH ONE OF THE HEADLINES COMING OUT OF FRIDAY'S SUMMIT. FRANKLY, IT WAS A LITTLE LIGHT ON DETAIL BUT VERY STRONG ON MESSAGE. KIM JONG UN BECOMING THE FIRST NORTH KOREAN LEADER SINCE THE KOREAN WAR TO STEP FOOT IN SOUTH KOREA. RUSHING OVER THE DMZ TO GREET HIS POST, SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON JAE-IN. AT THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS WE SPOKE TO IN OUR OWN OBSERVATION, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SHE'S BEEN ON THE INTERNATIONAL, LIVE STAGE. AT THE END OF SEVERAL LONG SESSIONS, THE TWO LEADERS ENDED UP CALLING FOR A COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION. STILL, THERE WAS NO REAL TIME FRAME FOR THIS OR OTHER SPECIFICS. LIKEWISE, THERE WAS A DRAMATIC CALL FOR A PEACE TREATY FORMALLY END THE KOREAN WAR. AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST, THAT COULD INVOLVE A LOT OF HAGGLING. THIS IS ALL A VERY GOOD WARM-UP FOR THE TRUMP-KIM MEETING. NOT SPELLING OUT THE DETAILS BUT STATING THE GOALS, AND MAY BE ALLOWING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO CUT TO THE CHASE. THE WHITE HOUSE, LIKE A WEEK, GOT A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT THIS GUY IS ABOUT. I ASKED ONE OF THE EXPERTS, IS KIM JONG UN SOMEBODY THAT DONALD TRUMP COULD DO BUSINESS WITH? I WAS TOLD "YES," MAYBE, HARRIS, WITH A BIG CAVEAT. WITH A BIG "BUYER BEWARE." Harris: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAUGHT IT, SOMEWHAT OF THE DELAY, SENATOR TIM SCOTT IN SOUTH CAROLINA SAID YEAH, WE CAN'T TRUST THESE PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO GET THEIR DEFINITIONS
