This is Australia — 
beautiful, majestic,
with its gorgeous
beaches, lush rain forest,
stunning deserts,
and snow fields.
I know what you’re thinking —
we’ve got all
those in America.
That’s true.
But in our ones,
you won’t get shot.
Australia only recently
became a not-getting-shot
destination.
For years we had relaxed
gun control and heaps
of mass shootings.
So it wasn’t really
worth visiting Australia
because it was pretty
much the same as the U.S.
But after the ’96
Port Arthur Massacre,
when 35 people died, Australia
saw a tourism opportunity
in people not dying.
So they brought in
tighter gun control
and banned
semiautomatic weapons
instead of just thinking
and praying a lot.
Not getting shot really
adds to the magic
of visiting Australia.
So you can come to places
like this and still be alive.
I’m not getting shot —
not getting shot here.
In America, there’s more
than 300 million guns.
That’s roughly one
for every person.
But here, I’m
not getting shot.
Not a sniper in
sight — no one’s
shooting at me here,
or here.
Come cuddle this little
fella without the risk
of getting shot.
It’s not just
about the sights.
It’s about the culture.
We’ve got Australian cinema.
What was your favorite part?
Definitely not getting shot.
In your United
States, on average
there’s a mass shooting
nine out of every 10 days.
But here in Australia,
we just go to the beach
without getting shot.
And if you love
Australia, it’s
a great place to
raise your kids, who
can graduate from school
without getting killed.
So come to beautiful
Australia
and don’t get shot.
“Ah!"
You tell them about all the
animals that’ll kill them?
 no.
