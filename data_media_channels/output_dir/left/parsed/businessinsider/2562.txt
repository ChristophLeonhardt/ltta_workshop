- When we think about power,
we often think about it
in terms of traditional,
twentieth century indices,
like for example, gross national product
or capacity for technological innovation.
Russia's definitely not a great power
by either of those measures.
away from those more objective things
to more subjective things like feelings,
like fear, like anxiety.
When we turn our own attention
away from the real world,
the three-dimensional world,
and we pay more attention
to the internet and to what
feels good or bad to us,
in effect, we're making
life easier for Russia.
What they can mobilize very
efficiently, very economically
actually, are psychological
resources over cyber.
They choose that because
it's easy for them.
They have a plan for the world.
They have a plan for Europe.
They have a plan for us.
But, it's not about imposing
some kind of positive vision.
It's about bringing us
back to where they are.
What President Putin does is
he replaces domestic policy
of which you can't have
any, with foreign policy.
He can't have domestic policy
because he's an oligarch
at the head of an oligarchical clan,
and he's running a country which
can't have the rule of law.
Hence, Russia is locked into place
for the foreseeable future where it is.
But, if he can convince
Europeans and Americans
that oligarchy is normal,
that the rule of law is a joke,
that democracy is fake,
and so on, he can bring us
to where Russia is.
And if he can do that,
then Russians will look
around the world and say,
"It's all just a joke.
"Everything's corrupt, everywhere.
"So, why don't we just
prefer our own corruption
"to other people's corruption?"
So, this is a strategy.
And, it's at work; it's
what we're up against, now.
There's a very important
difference, I think,
between a nationalism,
which always turns you back
on yourself, and a patriotism, which says,
"I wanna hold my country up to
a certain set of standards."
Nationalism will generally say,
"We have always been innocent.
"We are always the innocent victims."
So, for example, if you're Russia
and you're the biggest
country in the world,
nevertheless, you've somehow
always been on the defensive.
If you attack Ukraine,
nevertheless, this is somehow
a defensive rather than
an offensive operation.
Nationalism will say it's
always somebody else's fault.
The way it works politically is
that you do things like this.
You attack Ukraine.
You support the far right in Europe.
You support a presidential
candidate in the United States.
Eventually, there's gonna
be some kind of reaction.
That reaction comes.
Then, you say to your
people, "Well yes, look,
"this just proves that we were the victim.
"We were always the victim."
