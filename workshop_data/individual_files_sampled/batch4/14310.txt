we'll find out by June if the odds-on favorite to win the Stanley Cup this year the Toronto Maple Leafs will prevail but in the meantime hog towns beleaguered hockey club will surely win the championship for having the most diverse head office and pro hockey in the offseason diversity apparently for the sake of diversity found its way to the front office of the Toronto Maple Leafs that's because the club hired Hayley Wiccan Heiser as the team's assistant director of player development Wiccan Heiser was a star female hockey player competing for more than two decades on Canada's national teams and if she indeed has the qualifications to serve as an executive in the Leafs front office I have no problem with a woman being there as always I am beholden to the prime directive of merit when it comes to hiring for any position but the question beckons is Wiccan highs are there due to a PR stunt kind of like when the Tampa Bay Lightning invited men on Ray ohm to try out for their club in 1992 a female gumpa resulted in tons of press coverage for a hockey team forever in the shadow of other sports teams based in Florida even though minoan never stood it snowball's chance in Hades I'm making the club anyway among today's progressives some of whom are apparently even writing for the sport section of newspapers the idea of having a diverse front office and pro hockey seems to be crucially important for whatever reason for example last weekend in the Toronto Sun of all places there was an extensive Q&A with rookie Leafs general manager Kyle dubis it was one of those typical who's on first stories you see just as the regular season is about to kick off yet check out this query which is downright out of left field if you ask me question in looking at your hiring of Hayley Wiccan Heiser and player development and similar moves are you trying hard to be a 21st century team staying in tune with changes in society and dooba says quote we want to hire the best people regardless of their background gender sexual orientation or race end quote now if dubis stop talking there that would be a most appropriate answer but he goes on quote the more diverse they are going back to the player side of things then the more diverse the opinions in your group come from bring it together the right way and it's only going to help your team end quote really now if Haley recognizer had the very best credentials of all hockey people currently looking to get a job in a front office of an NHL team then good for her but if she was promoted over others simply due to her sex that's wrong and it actually does wicken Heiser herself a disservice and that it makes her hiring a token appointment in the meantime wouldn't be great if this hockey team got it it's probably already is an order which is to say I think if you polled Lee fans be they male or female black or white straight or gay Christian or Muslim I'll bet you a donut all of them would say they could not care less about beliefs having a diverse front office what they do care about is this franchise winning a Stanley Cup something that was last accomplished when the Beatles were still recording tunes for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
