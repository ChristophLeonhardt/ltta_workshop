1
00:00:00,485 --> 00:00:03,402
(mysterious music)

2
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:26,504
- My father was a Freemason.

3
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:31,048
My grandfather was so I
asked to join and they

4
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:32,420
they were delighted and

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,736
I had to have an informal interview.

6
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:39,891
Got asked a few questions
and then the date was set

7
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:41,727
for when I joined.

8
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:46,218
I had my joining ceremony
and then the rest is history.

9
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:48,452
That was 20 years ago now
but I still remember it

10
00:00:48,452 --> 00:00:49,812
like it was yesterday.

11
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:52,203
- My interest in Freemasonry
was very much sparked

12
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:53,278
at an early age.

13
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:55,735
I remember seeing my father
and grandfather going off to

14
00:00:55,735 --> 00:00:59,130
meetings and very much
enjoying their Freemasonry.

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,843
I've become very much
attracted to the history and

16
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:04,288
mysticism surrounding Freemasonry.

17
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:06,858
At the same time I was
very much, heavily involved

18
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,422
with scouting before going
to university and Freemasonry

19
00:01:10,422 --> 00:01:12,846
for me very much followed on from that.

20
00:01:12,846 --> 00:01:15,108
- So I joined masonry for a few reasons.

21
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:20,033
The main one being to
extend my circle of friends.

22
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:22,933
Secondly because I had an
inquisitive mind, I wanted

23
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,199
to know a bit more about
the history of Freemasonry.

24
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:27,783
I was asked to join by
a good friend of mine.

25
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:31,245
My next door neighbour and
at the time he asked me

26
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:35,338
to put a letter into the
lodge that I was interested

27
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:38,794
in joining and what I could
offer the lodge as a man

28
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:43,794
and the things I could bring
so once that was approved

29
00:01:43,823 --> 00:01:46,731
that letter I went in
for a short interview

30
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,993
met some of the guys and
I was happily approved

31
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:52,326
which was great.

32
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:01,432
- When I joined Freemasonry
I thought I was just

33
00:02:01,432 --> 00:02:03,131
joining a single lodge.

34
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:05,822
But actually I've joined
a much larger community.

35
00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:09,228
I've made very good lifelong
friends from a number of

36
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:10,378
different lodges.

37
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,466
We now have a young masons club
called the Essex Cornerstone

38
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,844
Club which provides an
opportunity for like-minded

39
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:19,717
individuals to come together
and take part in social

40
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:21,528
and charitable activities
throughout the year.

41
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:23,501
- So in Freemasonry we
sometimes have to stand up and

42
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:26,712
do some talking and the good
thing about that is that

43
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:29,457
I can take that back to
my work environment as

44
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:33,286
a transferable skill so being
able to have that confidence

45
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,818
and stand up and talk to
people almost with authority

46
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:39,578
gives me a good standing at work.

47
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:42,878
- First of all it's enabled
me to meet people from various

48
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,054
backgrounds that I don't
think I would've had the

49
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:47,927
opportunity of meeting before.

50
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:51,614
I travel for work quite a
lot so whether that's local

51
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:55,132
or international I've got
a great connection across

52
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:55,965
the world.

53
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:59,768
Secondly it's given me great life skills.

54
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:02,370
In our lodge meetings we
stand up and we present and we

55
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,011
talk and that's great.

56
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:07,670
We do the same at work so it
gives me confidence at work.

57
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,725
Then I think the other thing
is coming to our meetings is

58
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:15,058
a good space away from the
busyness of life and work

59
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:16,880
in general.

60
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,052
- My initiation was
actually very exciting.

61
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:29,915
Although initially it
appeared quite daunting.

62
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:33,741
The actual ceremony itself was
very personal and comforting

63
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:36,275
and something I will remember
and treasure forever.

64
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:39,852
- I was in a room with
lots of people that I knew.

65
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,723
Lots of people that I didn't know.

66
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:43,763
It was a warm friendly environment.

67
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:45,549
It was a fantastic story.

68
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,290
It really was which continues
throughout your masonic

69
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,669
journey and then after the
meeting we had a lovely meal

70
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:56,076
and a few drinks and
that's what it's all about.

71
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:58,560
- My initiation ceremony is
quite special and it's special

72
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,713
to every Freemason that joins.

73
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:03,239
What I was blown away by was
the amount of work that went

74
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,611
in for that ceremony by lots
of people that I've never

75
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,837
met before and people that
came up to you afterwards.

76
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:12,683
You almost feel like a
superstar afterwards because

77
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:16,426
everyone is there for you and
for your initiation and you'll

78
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:20,130
automatically have these
great friends around you and

79
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,547
friends for life.

80
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:39,706
- The ceremonies are things
which take us back to our roots

81
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:43,627
of medieval stonemasons but
also bring in some aspects of

82
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:46,311
learning and personal development.

83
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:49,016
There's three ceremonies
that we do quite often.

84
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:51,240
The first is the ceremony of initiation.

85
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,027
That brings a candidate into
Freemasonry and it really

86
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:58,448
allows that candidate to
reflect on who they are on the

87
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:01,352
fact that when everybody comes
into this world they come

88
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:02,674
in as equals

89
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:06,076
and as life progresses sometimes
people do better than other

90
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:09,703
people and it teaches us
that we need to be mindful of

91
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:12,279
that and see what we can
personally do to help out those

92
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,571
people who are less well off than us.

93
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:18,534
The second ceremony or the
second degree that teaches us

94
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:21,672
to better ourselves to
reflect on who we are.

95
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:23,188
How we fit into the world.

96
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:26,691
How we can make ourselves
better people through education.

97
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:29,728
Then the final ceremony the
third degree that teaches

98
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:33,526
us that perhaps we only have
so long on this world that

99
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:36,157
we're all mortal and that we
really need to make the most

100
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:37,636
of our time here.

101
00:05:37,636 --> 00:00:00,000
