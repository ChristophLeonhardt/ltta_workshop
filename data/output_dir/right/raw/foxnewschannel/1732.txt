WATCH THAT STORY.

00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:07,414
15 NOW PAST THE HOUR.

4
00:00:07,414 --> 00:00:10,684
>> AS I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY,

5
00:00:10,684 --> 00:00:14,621
MY FELLOW HOOSIERS, I SAY WITH

6
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:17,857
ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE JOBS ARE

7
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:19,025
COMING BACK.

8
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:23,296
CONFIDENCE IS BACK.

9
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,764
AND UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD

10
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:26,800
TRUMP AMERICA IS BACK AND WE'RE

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,367
JUST GETTING STARTED.

12
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:28,969
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

13
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:30,637
>> Sandra: THAT'S VICE

14
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:31,571
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE

15
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:32,973
CAMPAIGNING FOR MAKE BRAUN WHO

16
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:34,407
WON THE SENATE PRIMARY IN

17
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:35,108
INDIANA LAST WEEK.

18
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:36,509
NOW WE'RE LEARNING OF A NEW

19
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:37,811
ADDITION TO THE VICE

20
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:39,579
PRESIDENT'S POLITICAL ACTION

21
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:40,280
COMMITTEE.

22
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,815
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER

23
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:43,083
CAMPAIGN MANAGER, COREY

24
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:43,550
LEWANDOWSKI.

25
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,319
LET'S BRING IN DAVID BOSSIE WHO

26
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:50,457
WROTE "LET TRUMP BE TRUMP" WITH

27
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:50,857
LEWANDOWSKI.

28
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:52,492
YOU ARE FRIENDS YOU AND COREY,

29
00:00:52,492 --> 00:00:53,293
RIGHT?

30
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:53,860
>> YEAH.

31
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,161
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER QUITE A

32
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:55,629
FEW YEARS, YES.

33
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:57,764
>> Sandra: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

34
00:00:57,764 --> 00:01:01,901
THIS MOVE BY HIM TO JOIN VICE

35
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:02,502
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE'S

36
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:03,603
POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE?

37
00:01:03,603 --> 00:01:05,171
>> THIS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME IN

38
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:07,540
THE MAKING AND TALKED ABOUT NOW

39
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,475
INTERNALLY FOR THE LAST COUPLE

40
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:08,942
MONTHS.

41
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:11,011
SO THIS IS NO SURPRISE TO ME.

42
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:13,580
IT IS JUST A GREAT ADDITION TO

43
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,318
MAKE SURE THAT THIS TEAM, THE

44
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:19,719
SYMMETRY OF THIS TEAM IS ALL

45
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,588
MOVING FORWARD AND ON THE SAME

46
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:22,055
PAGE.

47
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:23,923
THIS IS A VERY GOOD SIGNAL TO

48
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:26,059
ALL OF THE TRUMP VOTERS OUT

49
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:27,460
THERE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THAT

50
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,395
WE'RE PUTTING THE TEAM BACK

51
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:28,862
TOGETHER.

52
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:30,630
>> Sandra: IS HE TAKING THE JOB

53
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,332
WITH THE PRESIDENT'S BLESSING?

54
00:01:32,332 --> 00:01:34,267
>> WELL, OF COURSE.

55
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:36,136
THE PRESIDENT AND COREY SPOKE

56
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:37,771
ABOUT THIS BEFORE HE DECIDED TO

57
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:38,505
DO IT.

58
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:41,541
IT'S A GREAT PLACE FOR COREY TO

59
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,310
BE ABLE TO MAKE MOVES FOR THE

60
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,312
PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT.

61
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:47,047
THIS IS JUST PART OF THE TEAM.

62
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:48,682
IT IS NOT ONE TEAM OR THE

63
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:50,083
OTHER, IT IS ONE TEAM.

64
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,351
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO

65
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:53,586
TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

66
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:55,922
>> Sandra: IS IT A GOOD MOVE AS

67
00:01:55,922 --> 00:01:57,524
IT PERTAINS TO PRESIDENT TRUMP?

68
00:01:57,524 --> 00:02:00,360
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" RAN THIS

69
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,163
HEADLINE, PENCE IS TRYING TO

70
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:05,065
CONTROL REPUBLICAN POLITICS.

71
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:07,167
TRUMP AIDES ARE NOT HAPPY.

72
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:08,801
IN THAT PARTICULAR PIECE THEY

73
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:10,370
WRITE ABOUT WORD OF INTERNAL

74
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,171
TENSIONS GETTING OUT BEYOND THE

75
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:13,740
WALLS OF THE WHITE HOUSE,

76
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,674
COMPLAINTS OF HIGH-RANKING

77
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:15,709
TRUMP OFFICIALS STARTING TO

78
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,010
CIRCULATE AT CAPITOL HILL.

79
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,378
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WITH THE

80
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:19,679
PRESIDENT AND SPENDING TIME

81
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:22,182
WITH HIM RECENTLY, RIGHT?

82
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:22,916
>> YES, SANDRA.

83
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,051
THIS IS ALL THE FAKE NEWS THAT

84
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,920
IS FIT TO PRINT THERE IN THE

85
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,487
GREAT LADY.

86
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:30,190
IT IS PATHETIC THAT THEY HAVE

87
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,259
TO CONTINUOUSLY TRY TO CREATE

88
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:34,661
DISSENSION AND SEW SEEDS OF

89
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:35,128
DOUBT INSIDE.

90
00:02:35,128 --> 00:02:36,429
THIS IS THE FURTHEST THING FROM

91
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:37,497
THE TRUTH.

92
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:38,431
THIS IS A TREMENDOUS MOVE.

93
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:39,933
IT HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR

94
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,568
WELL OVER A MONTH.

95
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:44,571
FOR COREY TO JOIN.

96
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:45,972
THIS IS A TREMENDOUS

97
00:02:45,972 --> 00:02:46,673
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRESIDENT

98
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:48,775
AND VICE PRESIDENT TO MOVE

99
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:49,476
FORWARD TOGETHER.

100
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:52,278
THERE IS NO PENCE AND TRUMP

101
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:52,746
TEAMS.

102
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:54,414
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT

103
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:56,750
THIS, IF THEY ARE TRULY TRUMP

104
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,884
PEOPLE, JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

105
00:02:57,884 --> 00:02:58,752
HOW THE PRESIDENT AND VICE

106
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:00,320
PRESIDENT OPERATE.

107
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,188
>> Sandra: THE PENCE COMMITTEE

108
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:04,991
DONATED MORE THAN $150,000 TO

109
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:06,393
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL

110
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:08,027
CANDIDATES IN FEBRUARY.

111
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:09,929
DOES THIS MAKE LEWANDOWSKI A

112
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:12,532
MAJOR PLAYER IN THE MID-TERMS?

113
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:15,568
>> WELL, COREY IS A MAJOR

114
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:17,904
PLAYER IN THE MID-TERMS BEFORE

115
00:03:17,904 --> 00:03:18,838
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY.

116
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:21,775
AND HE IS NOW GOING TO BE SEEN

117
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:24,477
AS THE PRESIDENT'S AND VICE

118
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:25,645
PRESIDENT'S EYES AND EARS

119
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:28,581
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

120
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:29,883
I'LL BE HAPPY TO HELP AND

121
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:30,583
SUPPORT HIM IN THAT EFFORT.

122
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,752
>> Sandra: I HAVE TO ASK YOU

123
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:33,620
ABOUT THE LEAKS COMING OUT OF

124
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,087
THE WHITE HOUSE.

125
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:35,522
YOU KNOW THE WHITE HOUSE INSIDE

126
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:35,855
AND OUT.

127
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:37,223
YOU KNOW IT WELL.

128
00:03:37,223 --> 00:03:39,225
WHO IS DOING THIS?

129
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:41,327
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST A

130
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:42,295
CONTINUATION OF A SAD STORY

131
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:43,463
THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON.

132
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:45,665
IT IS PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THERE

133
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:46,733
FOR THE RIGHT REASON.

134
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,835
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT, SANDRA,

135
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:50,203
THEY'RE THERE FOR THEMSELVES,

136
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:51,805
NOT THERE FOR THE PRESIDENT.

137
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:52,939
AND THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA.

138
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,674
SO THEY GET WORRIED AND THEY

139
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:57,277
THINK THEY KNOW BETTER THAN

140
00:03:57,277 --> 00:03:59,446
SOMEBODY WHO GOT 60 PLUS

141
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:02,348
MILLION VOTES AND IT IS THIS

142
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:04,384
PRESIDENT'S AGENDA, COREY AND I

143
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:06,486
AND OTHERS ARE ON THAT AGENDA

144
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:08,621
AND WE ARE TRYING TO EVERY DAY

145
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:09,456
MOVE THAT AGENDA FORWARD

146
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:11,090
WHETHER IT'S IN THE HOUSE OR

147
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,592
SENATE, WHETHER IT'S THROUGH

148
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:13,893
THE ELECTIONS AND PRIMARIES AND

149
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:15,028
IN THE UPCOMING MID-TERMS.

150
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:16,362
THAT'S WHAT WE DO AND WE'VE

151
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:19,165
BEEN DOING IT EVERY DAY.

152
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:20,333
THESE FOLKS ARE UNFORTUNATELY

153
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,334
IN IT FOR THEMSELVES AND I

154
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,669
THINK THAT THEY WANT TO BE

155
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,337
IMPORTANT TO MEMBERS OF THE

156
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:25,972
MEDIA THAT THEY KNOW AND I

157
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:27,640
THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO SERVE

158
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,242
JUSTICE IN THEIR MINDS ON OTHER

159
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:31,377
STAFFERS WHO ARE NOT DOING

160
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:33,947
THINGS THEIR WAY.

161
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:34,881
IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THIS

162
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:37,484
IS THE PRESIDENT'S WHITE HOUSE.

163
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,152
YOU SERVE AT THE PLEASURE OF

164
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:39,586
THE PRESIDENT.

165
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:42,422
IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE THERE,

166
00:04:42,422 --> 00:04:44,057
GO AND FIND ANOTHER JOB

167
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:44,424
SOMEWHERE.

168
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:45,558
THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE, MANY

169
00:04:45,558 --> 00:04:50,296
OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE IN

170
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:52,732
THOSE INCREDIBLY COVETED JOBS.

171
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:55,768
>> Sandra: WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN

172
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:56,703
WITH KELLY?

173
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,606
>> I THINK SHE APOLOGIZED FOR

174
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:00,974
WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER A REMARK

175
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:04,644
THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN MADE

176
00:05:04,644 --> 00:05:07,847
WHETHER IT WAS IN JEST OR NOT.

177
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:08,948
WHAT I RECOGNIZE FROM THAT --

178
00:05:08,948 --> 00:05:10,350
>> Sandra: DO YOU THINK SHE

179
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,251
SHOULD GO?

180
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,119
>> I THINK THE PEOPLE ON HER

181
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:15,688
STAFF, ON THE STAFF THAT SHE

182
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:18,258
WORKS WITH WHO LEAKED THAT ON

183
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:20,159
HER, THAT'S AS TROUBLING AS THE

184
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:20,660
STATEMENT ITSELF.

185
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,095
I THINK THERE IS PLENTY OF

186
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:23,196
BLAME TO GO AROUND.

187
00:05:23,196 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Sandra: INTERESTING STUFF.
