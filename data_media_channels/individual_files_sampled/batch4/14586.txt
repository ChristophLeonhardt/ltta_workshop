hold on to your wallets people because Finance Minister Bill Morneau has just announced that he is willing to hand over a taxpayer money to Kinder Morgan to offset financial losses caused by his government Finance Minister Bill Morneau has just announced that the federal government is willing to directly compensate Kinder Morgan's investors for any financial losses due to british columbia's law fair and obstructionism directed at the company's trans mountain pipeline expansion project now Morneau said and I quote the indemnification would allow Kinder Morgan to finish what they started what they received federal and BC approval to do more no also said as a government we need to ensure that the rule of law is respected and that investors have the certainty needed to complete the trans mountain pipeline expansion project because it's in the national interest to do so Morneau would not indicate if there were some sort of cap on how much of our money the government was willing to just hand over to Kinder Morgan investors and Morneau also said that if Kinder Morgan does walk away from the Trans Mountain pipeline that the Canadian government would then offer financial compensation to any other company that could potentially take the pipeline over the Liberals solution to allowing a shantytown of violent hippies and an unelected NDP premier in DC to hold the entire economy hostage is to just throw money in all directions and hope some unfortunate company stops to pick it up then Warren o went on to bragged that there are plenty of other investors out there willing to pick up the pieces of trans mountain if Kinder Morgan does announced that they will walk away from their pipeline at their self-imposed May 31st deadline just two short weeks away lots of other companies really are willing to get involved really bill why didn't Morneau name one why aren't these companies naming selves what other company would bother getting involved in what should be the simplest of energy infrastructure projects a Kinder Morgan trans mountain pipeline expansion is a simple twinning of a project that has operated for nearly seven decades without any sort of problem in the existing pipeline easement it's a laughable that Morneau would suggest after TransCanada gave up on energy East and after Northern Gateway was cancelled that any self-respecting pipeline would be lining up to do business in Canada especially if they have to do that business with the Liberal Party of Canada and Rachel Notley as their business partners and meanwhile in trumps America both our largest oil customer and newest competitor they're drilling so much that they can't build pipelines out of the Permian Basin fast enough but at least they are building them what a difference a pro-business administration makes now why are Canadian taxpayers the majority of which are pro pipeline on the hook for the actions of British Columbia's government and the Liberals in action why aren't the Liberals making BCB financially accountable for their actions where are the consequences for British Columbia why are we paying for B C's bad acts why do we even have a federal government if not to resolve issues between provinces using the rules we have already laid out for them I'm getting really tired of not only not having energy infrastructure but I'm also getting really tired of the prospect of having to pay companies because we don't allow energy infrastructure to go ahead in reality we won't really be paying to reimburse companies for their projects being indefinitely delayed we're actually going to be paying so that Trudeau never has to accept the political fallout of being the party of no Trudeau by throwing our cash at the problems he's making gets to be the leader of the party of oh well we tried but the mean and greedy capitalist companies pulled out anyway while simultaneously allowing obstructionism to choke out our industry which is really what Trudeau wants you don't stack your team with activists like Gerald Butz and Zoe Karen if you want to get pipelines built you just don't do it if you want pipelines built you marginalize anti oil activists as unreasonable in anti Canadian you don't hire them and legitimize their ideas using the full force of the federal government Canada we aren't even a real country anymore we're just a collection of Baltic states and the colony of Alberta with some centralized taxation in Ottawa 150 years and Trudeau has broken the economic union that held us together for so long and anyone cheering for the government being involved in this project and taking it over is cheering to give Trudeau the noose by which to strangle us all remember what happened last time a Trudeau with a visceral dislike for Alberta took over our oil industry yeah me too for the rebel media I'm Shiela gun Reid so what you just saw right there it was my daily video that I do here at the rebel but I also do a
