what is the toughest environment to find your way using nature the answer I give is always the same it's if any wooded environment with an overcast sky my name is Tristan gully I'm the author of how to read water clues and patterns from puddles to the sea I get asked a lot what is the toughest environment to find your way using nature and people expect me to say desert sandy ones or icy ones but actually the answer I give is always the same if any wooded environment with an overcast sky if the Sun Moon or stars are out it's pretty straightforward if you're an open country there are Clues all around you but once you get into dense woodland and it's cloudy above you have to use a whole new set of techniques we're relying on storm damage because light winds don't make it into the heart of dense woodland so what we need to do is look for trees have been blown down by storm and we will find a trend that then the detective work begins because we've got to work out which way these trees have come down we might be lucky and catch a glimpse of the Sun and that helps us work out hat all the trees have been blown down from southwest and northeast but also trees that have fallen down hundreds of years ago and rotted can still help us if you've been walking in the woods and you suddenly notice it gets all bumpy there are sort of mounds and then it dips that's a sign there's a storm hundreds of years ago and again if we can work out the trend all you have to do is stand on the mound stand on the high bit face towards today that's where the roots have been pulled out and you're facing in the direction that that storms wind came from so once you work that out using any of the hundreds of natural navigation techniques all of those bumps in a woodland will help you
