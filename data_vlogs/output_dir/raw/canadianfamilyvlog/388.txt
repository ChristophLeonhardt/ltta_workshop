00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,690
of fun and yeah it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a great outing</font>

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,030
and the kids enjoyed it and every time

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,590
in the car is so funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the three</font>

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,090
of them were in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">summer like turned a corner they were</font>

23
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,879
like whoa whoa so they had a great time

24
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,039
together so I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did it even</font>

25
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,850
though it was so hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get all the car</font>

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,250
seats in so thankfully two of them are

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,400
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> booster seats so it was a lot easier</font>

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">to put the three in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the back I wouldn't</font>

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it post all car seats</font>

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,100
there's no way and then I totally forgot

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,140
to tell you guys but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

32
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,700
really funny I can laugh at it now but

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,380
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning was really frustrating but</font>

34
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,970
I couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> find the middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seat belt I</font>

35
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,049
had no clue where it was like I'm never

36
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,729
gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in before so I know they came</font>

37
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,159
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ceiling and I was looking</font>

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,960
everywhere I had to help the whole seats

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,750
taken apart and like like peeking in

40
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,280
between the little cracks and stuff

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,439
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find it and at the hardest</font>

42
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,509
time and I finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I called Nick at</font>

43
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,280
work and I asked him and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like no</font>

44
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,049
it's a seven seater van it should be

45
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,549
there and like the buckle for it was

46
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,009
there so he's suggested calling the

47
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,390
dealership and asking them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said</font>

48
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">check the ceiling so I did again I went</font>

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,899
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and check the ceiling I didn't see</font>

50
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,880
anything so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like really</font>

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,290
frustrating I was like oh there's no

52
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,939
seat belt how we're supposed to go so I

53
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,409
called the dealership and then they say

54
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,409
oh you have to you have to combine like

55
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,969
well I can't come by because I have no

56
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:07,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">one to watch the kids like doesn't make</font>

57
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,008
any sense so then I called our neighbors

58
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,780
we work to our cousins that live just

59
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,890
down the street from us

60
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,170
and her and a friend came over shout out

61
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,470
to Jessa and today and um they came over

62
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,530
and watch the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kids while well sorry</font>

63
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,390
Jessa watch the kids while she and I

64
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,220
went out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the van to look for the</font>

65
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,930
seatbelt see the second set of eyes

66
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,790
might help so we're out there for like

67
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,470
20 minutes and we couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> find it at</font>

68
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,790
all we were like tearing the whole place

69
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,740
apart we could find it so finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

70
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,970
like okay well if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mind</font>

71
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,440
watching the kids I'm just going to whip

72
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,060
over the dealership and get their help

73
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,760
so she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh yeah no problem so I go</font>

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I go to close the trunk as I'm</font>

75
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,450
closing the truck from<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking up I'm</font>

76
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,970
like you got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kidding me so like on</font>

77
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,830
the ceiling of like the trunk not the

78
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,600
ceiling like where the seat is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trunk</font>

80
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,970
like no strap or anything it's a strap

81
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that comes out from the ceiling buckles</font>

82
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,320
into the actual seat buckle and then

83
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,140
buckles again so so frustrating but I
