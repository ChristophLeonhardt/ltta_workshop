talking about apple and first I want to start the two big takeaways here is that Apple we think is going to become more of a services business over the next several years that's going to take a big shift in terms of how they approach the market a negative impact on profitability but ultimately a longer impact on growth and visibility second is we think that there are two big markets that they can go after which is augmented reality and also auto so there is hope around future market segments one big misconception is that Apple is missing everything and they're just not growing and part of this comes from investors looking at the growth rates and it's been pretty low over the last couple years if you look at the market cap of applets down four percent in the last two years where Google is up forty-two percent and Facebook is of fifty two percent and that kind of fuels disbelief there is one thing that Apple has missed which is the low on phone market and I think the key takeaway there is that we think that they can approach that market with more of a services first approach moving to the iphone at sixty-six percent of revenue is seventy-three percent of earnings ultimately this is a big segment for obvious reasons in terms of the growth rate it stepped up with the iphone 6 and as thirty-seven percent its dropped back off with its down ten percent more recently we do expect that the iphone to try to lower often terms or steady off in terms of growth rate at ten percent in part because the upgrade cycle we think ultimately is going to be more powerful the lag between upgrades has been extending and people are holding on to their phones longer it's now 33 months versus before it was 28 months SPS on the iPhone jumped up with the iphone 6 but they've been kind of all over the place in the last two years moving forward to the near-term one of the reasons why we're optimistic about the iphone is that everyone still wants an iphone it's not about a big feature it's just in general tie on the wish list our consumer teams show that seven percent of people want an iPhone this holiday versus five percent a year ago that's the highest ranked product of any product that's on the wish list for the holiday the number two is the ipad or the mac at two percent and the number three is the xbox at one percent and so this whole scene that apple doesn't have exciting products isn't necessarily resonating with consumers and they think about things that they're going to invest in unfortunate you're going to have to wait for that iphone because the lead times are a couple weeks one of the other reasons why we're positive about the iphone more longer term is this massive wave of upgrades that's coming the longer the people hold on to their iPhones the bigger the base of the upgrades and we can go through and model that out and that base is going to reach around 300 million units in the next few years to put that 300 million units into perspective is that Apple has at their peak in the iphone 6 they did 235 million so in other words is this big base of old iPhones essentially should carry the iphone growth for the next couple years in terms of the iPhone 10 there's a lot of focus on what the expectations obviously OLED which would be a wraparound screen and would look more futuristic VR and AR as another piece Apple's been talking more about AR recently and we think that they can shift from their typical playbook of being a fast follower to actually innovating around AR with the iPhone 10 the AR the device of choice is going to be the phone for the next five years eventually it moves to a wearable but right now with the iphone 7 plus the dual camera there's depth mapping so they can do more with AR but look for that to be one of the key differentiating features not just it looks a little bit different but the whole AR theme with the iPhone 10 shifting to services this is really our big takeaway is that services right now is twelve percent of revenue it's going to be a 28 billion dollar business next year that compares to Facebook which is expected to be a 36 billion dollar business the primary part of the services business is the App Store and sixty percent the other is iTunes and then the balance 25% of iCloud applecare and Google that's the google search revenue Apple pay is in there but it's so small it really doesn't add up the growth rates are particularly impressive around services even though the numbers are getting higher and more difficult to complicating more difficult the growth rate has been accelerating we're modeling forward to go from 17 to twelve percent next year but that's pretty conservative i think that there's reason that this can be a much bigger business as we talked about there's a little boost that the services business is going to get on December 15th with Super Mario run which will be a ten-dollar app there are also being more aggressive in terms of buying apps and trying to sell you different services here's one for a 240 dollar year option for cloud storage but overall apps are just generally getting more expensive if you look at the top selling apps on desktop right now there's a $300 for final cut $200 Logic Pro Dropbox has a 750 dollar pro option it's an annual subscription apple takes fifteen percent of that so just over a hundred dollars and that's pure margin on the phone side it tends to be more gaming just looking at pokemon you can buy pokemon coins from a dollar package to honor dollar packages but the concept of how people are spending in the mouth of their spending is increasing the key takeaway from today's presentation is what we're suggesting Apple do not the fact that they're going to do this but to shift to a services model right now apples profit first which means they try to make a lot of money when they cell phone that's resulted in small market share in the world for their phones but they have the majority of the global hardware profits overall they have a 20-percent operating margin profit first is very different than the right approach which is product first that's basically what Google and Facebook do and in a product first approach they try to build user bases examples would be what's app and google maps and by doing that it yields much higher margins so when you put this together we think is Apple focuses more on services that can be a more profitable business today we think it has a 40-percent operating margin about fifty percent higher than the overall apple business so how could they actually do this and one thing is that they could grow their current 1 billion active devices and the thirty seven dollars a year per user and the way they do that is by reducing the price of the iphone potentially doubling the market share of the iphone this would cause their current stronghold in the US and Western Europe to expand to Latin America Eastern Europe and Asia and ultimately we think this is going to be a more profitable more sustainable business that investors will reward quickly moving to the Mac it's ten percent of business at third largest market the growth has been declining for the last couple years but now with a new versions of the max book it should jump up for next year one impressive stat around the madness for the last 15 years asp's have been astonishingly resilient they're down fourteen percent during that time which is a surprise the ipad now nine percent of revenue the growth has been all over the board it's bottomed out last year in 2015 at down twenty two percent it's a little bit better in 2016 but we're still expecting to be down about ten percent this year the ASP saw bump up with the iPad pro but they're still all over the board the takeaway from the ipad is that this is probably not really a growing business longer term it's just certainly going to be flat but it is an important part of the story because when we think about the services approach it's an important part of how people interact with the web moving to the watch we're expecting 18 million units next year or nine billion dollars that means that the business compares to Fitbit which is about two and a half million so this is a big business that's basically three percent of Apple hidden within Apple their key focus today is activity but ultimately we think that they're going to shift more of a wellness product we would expect more health care providers to start to issue watches to people for better wellness an apple TV if you would have asked me five years ago if I would be looking at this slide today I would find that hard to believe in fact it is just a hockey puck but they have a nice play here in terms of how they're selling content and specifically is that the top three grossing apps on appletv are HBO netflix and hulu so this is part of that broader ecosystem in general we think they've sold about 40 million Apple TVs over the last nine years and quickly on Apple pay it doesn't really matter in terms of the size of the the apples business but it's important in terms of the experience Apple pay in September was at five hundred percent year of year the number of transactions the number of transactions in the month of September equaled the previous 12 months combined and now it's available in in browser so you can use it in your desktop there's several hundred thousand of those websites that allow you to do it in desktop and here I'm buying a pair of socks I want to note that once you select the size of the socks a Buy button comes up immediately you don't even deal with a check out or an Express Checkout it's right there retailers don't want you to abandon and they want you to purchase as soon as you're in that mode that total transaction took 10 seconds paypal is in trouble is we look at the top 100 retailers we've seen those retailers starting to shift away from paypal and starting to emphasize this better experience for iOS and just quickly in terms of the future we know that they go through products where they start small and get very big fun to think back that the ipod one day was fifty percent of business today it's one percent but the three key areas of focus is there going to be ramping up their R&D spend apples growing R&D faster than their revenue they're going to spend about 10 billion in R&D versus Google at about 13 billion and the three areas that they're going to be focused on we think for new categories one is foldable phones the ideas are bendable glass today by putting a charge through it you can make it strong eventually your phone and your tablet it replaces some sort of foldable device several years AR is a huge deal next version of AR for five years is your phone eventually it's going to be a wearable this is important because the way we interface with machines is changing its going beyond a crude interface of a text of a touchscreen to more intuitive voice your gesture a gaze even your thoughts to drive that and lastly is auto a topic we approached with some hesitation of our lessons in the past because apples investment in something doesn't mean that it's going to see the light of day but it is a big market and just point out the real market here isn't the opportunity for Tesla to sell 500,000 vehicles in 2018 the real market is a change in terms of how people are using transportation surveymonkey estimates was 20 million monthly subscribers for uber and lyft and that is the opportunity were eventually transportation is going to go to the ride sharing and they obviously have this letter that was released last week that the Wall Street Journal is reporting on there's a debate are they going to build a car are they going to be the brains behind we lean to they're going to build a car because they still want to do a lot of the hardware and the software so that's Apple on the route let's hear it for gene
