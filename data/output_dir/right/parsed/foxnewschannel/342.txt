IMPORTANCE OF THE MIDTERM
ELECTIONS NOW JUST FOUR WEEKS
AWAY.
>> I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY, ON
THE HEELS OF A TREMENDOUS
VICTORY FOR OUR NATION, OUR
PEOPLE.
AND OUR BELOVED CONSTITUTION.
OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, EVERY
AMERICAN HAS NOW SEEN THE
PROFOUND STAKES IN THE UPCOMING
ELECTION.
MARIA: JOINED MURINO REPUBLICAN
CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN, DEVIN
NUNES, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE, GOOD MORNING MR.
CHAIRMAN.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> GREAT TO BE HERE AGAIN.
MARIA: BRETT KAVANAUGH WILL
START HIS NEW JOB PRETTY SOON,
NEXT WEEK ON THE SUPREME COURT.
YOUR REACTION TO WHAT HAS TAKEN
PLACE THIS WEEKEND?
>> I WILL TELL YOU, IT REALLY
SHOWS THE DIVIDE BETWEEN WHAT
YOU HAVE IN WASHINGTON D.C. AND
NEW YORK CITY AND THE BELTWAY
AND THE BIG CITIES IN AMERICA
WHO HAVE BEEN BUYING INTO THIS
MOB LIKE MENTALITY OF OPPOSING
A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NOMINEE
FOR APPARENTLY NO REASON.
IN CONTRAST, MARIA, I'VE BEEN
OUT HERE IN THE RURAL PART OF
CALIFORNIA MY DISTRICT FOR THE
LAST WEEK.
I CANNOT GO ANYWHERE, TO ANY
COFFEESHOP, GROCERY STORE,
ANYWHERE, WITHOUT SOMEONE
BRINGING UP JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND
HOW UPSET THEY ARE.
NOT ONLY BY WHAT THEY ARE DOING
TO HIM IN THE FAMILY BUT BY THE
BEHAVIOR OF POLITICIANS.
IT LOOKS LIKE TOTAL CHAOS IN
WASHINGTON D.C. WHEN REALLY,
THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.
WE HAVE NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD IN
THIS COUNTRY.
MARIA: WE LOOK AT THE OUTCOMES
OF THE PRESIDENTS HAVE HAD,
THEY'VE BEEN VERY POSITIVE FROM
ECONOMIC TO OBVIOUSLY, THE
JUDGE NAMING IS, JUDICIAL AS
WELL AS THE SUPREME COURT.
IT IS INTERESTING TO SAY THE
HATE COMING FROM THE LEFT.
SUSAN COLLINS, VOTED OBVIOUS
BECOME A VERY IMPORTANT TO GET
HER VOTE TO CONFIRM KAVANAUGH.
SHE HAS BEEN FLOODED WITH
ABUSIVE TWEETS.
THREATENING DEATHS, VIOLENCE,
FOR SUSAN COLLINS, WE SEE THE
PROTESTERS CONTINUING.
WHERE DO THINGS GO FROM HERE,
CONGRESSMAN?
GIVEN THE LEVEL OF HATE AND
UPSET ON THE LEFT AND THE
SHAMING TACTICS?
>> I THINK THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST TWO
YEARS.
IT IS BEEN DONE TO THE
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES.
A BUNCH OF BILLIONAIRES WORKING
WITH THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA AND
DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO BRING UP A
HOAX, FAKE NEWS STORY, THEY
RILE UP THE BASE AND I HAVE A
BUNCH OF AMERICANS OUT THERE
WHO BELIEVE THINGS THAT JUST
ARE NOT TRUE.
YOU COUPLE THAT WITH WHAT YOU
HAVE SEEN WITH ALL THESE CRAZY
PROTESTS AND WHEN YOU ASK, WHAT
ARE YOU PROTESTING ABOUT?
THEY CANNOT ANSWER THE
QUESTION.
RIGHT?
YOU COVER THIS EVERY DAY ON
YOUR SHOW.
THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL, THE
MILITARY IS BEING REBUILT,
TRADE AGREEMENT GETTING DONE.
WHAT DO YOU SEE, WHAT OTHER
PROTESTING?
NOBODY UNDERSTANDS.
THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE LIKE,
WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON
THERE?
THAT IS WHY I SAY, WHAT YOU SAW
HAPPEN, REALLY, I WILL SUBMIT
DOWN TO THIS.
YOU SO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING,
TO THE PRESIDENT, WITH
PROTESTS, BLOCKING STREETS,
VIOLENCE.
YOU NOW SAW THAT DOWN TO NUMBER
ONE, A FEDERAL JUDGE.
AND NOW, UNITED STATES
SENATORS.
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
HAVE WOKE UP TO THE FACT THAT
THIS IS NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR FOR
PEOPLE TO BE DOING IN THIS
COUNTRY.
MARIA: THAT IS WHAT WE SAW LAST
WEEK.
A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WE WANT TO
SHOW.
BECAUSE A NEW STRATEGY OF
GETTING IN YOUR FACE WAS REALLY
RAMPED UP AS THE CONFIRMATION
PROCESS TOOK PLACE LAST WEEK.
WATCH THIS.
>> WHY ARE YOU PUTTING YOUR
HANDS ON HER?
>> DON'T YOU WAVE YOUR HAND AT
ME!
MARIA: NOT TO MENTION, THE
SO-CALLED -- WHERE AN INTERN
FOR SHEILA JACKSON, A DEMOCRAT,
SHEILA JACKSON AS WELL AS
BARBARA BOXER.
THE INTRO WAS ARRESTED BY
PUTTING INFORMATION, ADDRESSES,
PHONE NUMBERS OF LINDSEY
GRAHAM, MIKE LEE AND ORRIN
HATCH ON THE INTERNET.
>> YEAH, THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE
SEEING, MARIA.
THIS IS WAS HAPPENING ALL OF
AMERICA.
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION, IF MYSELF FOR
TREY GOWDY WOULD HAVE STARTED
ASKING QUESTIONS OF TOP DOJ
OFFICIALS, WE WOULD HAVE
BROUGHT OUT THE YEARBOOK AND
STARTED PAGING THROUGH THEIR
HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOKS.
AND STARTED ASKING THEM
QUESTIONS.
OKAY?
TWO YEARS AGO, YEAR AND AND A
HALF AGO, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN
LAUGHED AT, MOCKED.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST
JOKE.
AND BY THE WAY IT IS THE
BIGGEST JOKE.
MARIA: DO THINK THAT THIS IS
CHANGE THE DYNAMICS GOING INTO
THE MIDTERMS FOUR WEEKS AWAY?
>> I DO.
MOST AMERICANS KNOW IT IS
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS TO HAVE
UNITED STATES SENATORS ASKING A
FEDERAL JUDGE ABOUT HIS
YEARBOOK ENTRY.
IT IS RIDICULOUS!
I HOPE THAT YOU HAD TENS OF
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PAYING
ATTENTION TO THIS.
I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW,
