[music]

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,969
What you just saw
is a re-creation

3
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,000
of an asteroid hitting the
Earth. If the asteroid were

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,160
the size of a pea
and it was slamming

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,590
into a tiny piece of the Earth.

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,640
It also shows a surprising
way huge amounts of water

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,670
could have reached our planet.

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,470
That’s important.

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,530
Earth has a lot of water.

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,920
About 70% of its surface
is covered with it.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,190
But where did it come from?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,690
There are different
ideas about how

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,730
to account for Earth’s water.

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,350
It could have been
here from the start

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,430
or arrived via comets
or interplanetary dust.

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,740
And then there are asteroids.

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,550
Unlike comets that are
essentially frozen dust balls,

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,780
asteroids carry molecules of
water bound up with their rock.

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,810
Four-plus billion
years ago, the Earth

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,700
was pummeled by asteroids
in a time called

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,910
the “late bombardment."

22
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,640
It was thought that the
water in the asteroids

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,210
would be lost during the
intense heat of the impacts,

24
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,340
but that may not be so.

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,180
Scientists used
NASA’s vertical gun —

26
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,710
an apparatus three
stories high —

27
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,500
to mimic the process with
much, much smaller objects.

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,350
They shot a
pea-sized bit of rock

29
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,490
called “antigorite,” composed
partly of water, into a tiny bit

30
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,680
of pumice with no water.

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,730
The tiny rock projectile
only goes about 10 feet,

32
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,990
but at more than
11,000 miles per hour.

33
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,350
Scientists found that despite
extreme temperatures on impact,

34
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,620
up to 30% of the
pebble asteroid’s water

35
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,080
was trapped in melted rock.

36
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,770
As the stand-in
asteroid made contact,

37
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,030
the pumice melted
and fused together

38
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,550
with tiny bits of the
projectile in a substance

39
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,890
called “breccia."

40
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,530
Vaporized water molecules
were trapped in the breccia,

41
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,350
some of which you can see here.

42
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,440
For real asteroids
hitting the Earth,

43
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,400
that could be a lot of water.

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,770
And it could be released
later, for example,

45
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,350
in steam from lava flows.

46
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,690
So asteroids could
conceivably have

47
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,260
delivered enormous amounts
of water to the planet

48
00:02:15,260 --> 00:00:00,000
and helped make life
on Earth possible.
