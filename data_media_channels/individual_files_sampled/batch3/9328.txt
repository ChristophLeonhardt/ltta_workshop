Shannon: HE ACTUALLY FLEW INSTEAD OF TAKING A SPECIAL TRAIN THIS TIME. SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECISION TO PULL THE U.S. OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL. "LEAVING THE AGREEMENT COULD EMBOLDEN AN ALREADY DANGEROUS REGIME, THREATEN OUR FRIENDS WITH DESTRUCTION, POSE UNACCEPTABLE DANGEROUS TO AMERICA'S SECURITY AND TRIGGER AN ARMS RACE IN THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS REGION." LET'S GET REACTION FROM REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN AND VETERAN FROM FLORIDA BRIAN MATZ, ON A HOUSE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AMONG OTHER THINGS. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WANT. WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID? I THINK THEY WERE JUST FLAT-OUT WRONG. YOU LOOK AT THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION, IT'S LIKE THEY SUFFERED FROM SOME CHAMBERLAIN SYNDROME WHERE IF THEY COULD IGNORE OR A P.R. ENEMIES ENOUGH THAT SOMEHOW OUR ENEMIES WOULD DISAPPEAR OR GO AWAY AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE. AFTER THAT THEY WERE EMBOLDENED. YOU SAW THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD ON THE BANKS OF ISRAEL. YOU SEE WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN YEMEN ATTACKING OUR NAVY VESSELS, TAKING OUR SAILORS HOSTAGE. YOU'VE SEEN THE THINGS THAT HAVE GONE ON SINCE THEN, THEY'VE BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN. Shannon: WHAT YOU MAKE OF THIS? I KNOW THAT YOU AND YOUR TIME IN THE ARMY AMONG OTHER THINGS YOU WERE A BOMB ATTACK BUT YOU ALSO WERE TRAINED WITH REGARD TO NUCLEAR WEAPONRY. THAT'S RIGHT. Shannon: WHAT DO YOU MAKE ABOUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAYS AND WHAT FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY HAS BEEN NOT SAYING THIS GUARD RAILS ON THEM TO STOP THEM FROM MOVING FORWARD AND TAKING AWAY THE DEAL TAKES AWAY THOSE PROTECTIONS? THAT'S NOT THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION. THEY NEEDED THREE THINGS TO DEVELOP A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THE MATERIAL TO DO IT, A DELIVERY SYSTEM, AN ICBM OR WHATEVER DELIVERY SYSTEM TO DELIVER WHEREVER THEY WANT AND THEY NEEDED THE MONEY TO DO IT. PEOPLE SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES WHY IS IT THAT THIS IS TECHNOLOGY THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP IN THE 1940s, THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS BY THE '50s AND 60s AND IRAN STILL HASN'T DEVELOPED IT TO THIS DAY? THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE MATERIALS THAT THEY NEEDED. THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE TECHNOLOGY, THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE MONEY THAT THEY NEEDED TO GO OUT THERE AND DEVELOP THESE SYSTEMS. WE LOOSEN THE RESTRICTIONS ON THEM TO DEVELOP THOSE DELIVERY SYSTEMS, THOSE BALLISTIC MISSILE SYSTEMS. WE ALLOW THEM ACCESS TO THE WORLD STAGE IN TERMS OF BEING OUT THERE TO GO AND SELL THEIR OIL IN THE WORLD STAGE. WE ALLOW THEM TO COLONIZE THE MIDDLE EAST AND EXPLOIT THE RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE REGION. WE ARE GIVING THEM ALL THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED AND NOW THE LAST PIECE THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO THEM WAS ALL I HAVE TO DO IS WAIT OUT ENOUGH TIME AND THEY WILL HAVE ALL THE MATERIAL THEY NEED TO GO OUT THERE AND PUT IT ON THE END OF THE WARHEAD. Shannon: TODAY REACTION FROM IRANIAN PRESIDENT SAINT QUOTED AS SAYING THIS ON STATE TELEVISION THERE SAYING HE HAD ORDERED IRAN'S ATOMIC ENERGY ORGANIZATION TO PREPARE FOR UNLIMITED URANIUM ENRICHMENT IN THE EVENT THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO WITHDRAW FROM THE PACK. THEY SAY THE EUROPEANS ARE STILL PART OF THIS, WE ARE NOT LEAVING THE PACT, BUT IF WE DECIDE TO WE ARE READY TO FIRE THE STUFF RIGHT BACK UP. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE KNOWN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THE PRIME MINISTER PUT OUT THERE, THAT THE IRANIANS WERE CHEATING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THEY WEREN'T AN HONEST BROKER WHEN THEY WERE NEGOTIATING THIS WITH CARRIE, THEY WEREN'T UPFRONT ABOUT WHAT THEIR TRUE INTENTIONS WERE WITHIN NUCLEAR PROGRAM. OUT THERE AND THAT INFORMATION THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS REFERENCING, SO WE KNOW THEY ARE READY TO FIRE THIS PROGRAM UP AND THEY WERE READY TO CHEAT ON THE PROGRAM WHILE THEY WEREN'T LETTING INSPECTORS INTO THEIR FACILITIES WHERE WE KNEW THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE DEVELOPING THE SYSTEMS. Shannon: MANY OF OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES HAVE URGED THE PRESIDENT TO STAY, TRY TO BETTER IT FROM BEING STILL ENGAGED WITH IT. EMMANUEL MACRON'S TWEET TODAY SAYS FRANCE, GERMANY AND THE U.K. REGRET THE U.S. DECISION TO LEAVE THE AGREEMENT. THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION REGIME IS AT STAKE. WHAT DOES THIS DO FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ALLIES NOW RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ALLIES NO NOW? IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE TENUOUS. I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD DENY THAT, BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COME TO A REALIZATION THAT YOU DON'T MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR ENEMIES. YOU NEGOTIATE PEACE WITH FORMER ENEMIES AND IRAN IS NOT ANY KIND OF FORMER ENEMY. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN MAKING THAT KIND OF NEGOTIATION WITH A NATION THAT'S WILLING TO GO OUT THERE AND ATTACK OUR SERVICE
