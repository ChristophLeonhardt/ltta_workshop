whatever you think of him there's no denying that the Vladimir Putin has made Russia important again here he was in 2004 winning a second term as president against a field as hopeless as the one this year back then Russia's opinion on world affairs didn't count for much but as he said during this campaign people are listening now his long leadership has been designed to guarantee a continued direction for Russia down a very definite path making sure there is a voice in the world as loud as that of the United States at home his admirers say his achievements have been enormous come I mean public order coalesced yeah when Putin came to power it was hard for us to understand that in our government American advisers were working why were they telling us what to do nobody was talking to Russia about solving global problems our country is Putin's life and therefore Russia's life is our president actions which in recent years made Russia's presence felts have been utterly polarizing the annexation of Crimea turning the Syrian war to the advantage of the Assad regime cost Russia heavily Putin never looked comfortable at g8 meetings at the best of times now Russia is out Western sanctions and the total mismanagement of Russia's oil and gas wealth left most of the world's biggest country impoverished while a small clique in Moscow grabbed all the money it is striking how Putin's popularity is very often at his strongest in places which have seen almost no material benefits from his nearly twenty years in power it only goes to show how potent identity politics and nationalism can be and they remain Putin's strongest cards and so the people who run Russia are coming up against a problem Putin's presented as the only man to keep Russia great but after this term his time supposed to be up so what who comes next yes if you're a reporter than you could I avoid already was one option is that after 2024 he changes the constitution as they did in Kazakhstan and China and he stays on as long as he is capable or in the next two or three years he will pass power on to someone acceptable unless he decides to stay on forever Putin will have to use this last term to cement a legacy from the look of it it will lean heavily towards militarism and even greater hostility to the West it is after all what Putin does best Lawrence Lee al Jazeera Moscow
