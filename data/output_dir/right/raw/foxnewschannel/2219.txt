1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:02,009
AND FLIPPED THE SENATE SEAT FROM

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:02,677
BLUE TO RED.

3
00:00:02,677 --> 00:00:04,645
LET’S GET BACK TO THE QUESTIONS.

4
00:00:04,645 --> 00:00:05,680
>> Bret: GENTLEMEN, IF YOU

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,715
WOULD, WELCOME BACK, IF YOU

6
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:09,851
WOULD PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND IF

7
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:11,753
YOU WOULD SUPPORT MITCH

8
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:12,387
McCONNELL FOR REPUBLICAN

9
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:17,292
LEADER IN THE SENATE.

10
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:20,528
[LAUGHTER]

11
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:24,666
[APPLAUSE]

12
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:31,139
>> Bret: WE NOTED YOUR .

13
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:35,076
WE GOT THAT.

14
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:38,814
YOU’VE BEEN A BENEFICIARY OF

15
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:40,415
GROUPS, WHY WOULDN’T YOU

16
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:40,782
SUPPORTED?

17
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:42,617
>> MITCH McCONNELL HAS AN EVEN

18
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:43,685
ASK FOR MY SUPPORT.

19
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:46,288
I THINK IT’S WAY TOO PREMATURE.

20
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:47,856
I THINK CANDIDLY MITCH

21
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:48,557
McCONNELL DESERVES A DEBT OF

22
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:51,860
GRATITUDE FOR BEING ABLE TO HOLD

23
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,762
A SUPREME COURT SEAT OPEN SO

24
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:54,696
NEIL GORSUCH COULD BE ON THE

25
00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:56,999
SUPREME COURT TODAY.

26
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:58,233
WHAT I’M INTERESTED IN DOING IS

27
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:01,070
GETTING THROUGH THE NOVEMBER

28
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,838
ELECTION BRINGING A MUCH-NEEDED

29
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:03,605
REPUBLICAN VOTE TO THE

30
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,406
UNITED STATES SENATE AND THEN WE

31
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:06,008
WILL SEE WHO’S RUNNING FOR

32
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:07,209
SENATE.

33
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:09,011
I’M NOT RULING ANYBODY END, I’M

34
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:10,813
NOT RULING ANYBODY OUT.

35
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:12,615
NOBODY HAS ASKED FOR MY SUPPORT.

36
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,016
WHAT I WOULD DO IS MAKE A

37
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:16,085
DECISION ON WHO IS GOING TO LEAD

38
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:18,854
THE SENATE TO SUPPORT THE

39
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:19,455
PRESIDENT TRUMP AGENDA.

40
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:20,156
>> Bret: I’M NOTICING YOU ARE

41
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:23,192
NOT RAISING YOUR HAND EITHER.

42
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:24,527
>> I’M NOT THE PRODUCT OF THE

43
00:01:24,527 --> 00:01:25,828
LIBERAL ESTABLISHMENT.

44
00:01:25,828 --> 00:01:28,064
I THINK THAT’S WHY YOU ARE

45
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,731
SAYING ALL THE CONSERVATIVES

46
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:29,432
COME OUT FOR ME.

47
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:31,200
I’M GOING TO MAKE THE RIGHT

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,901
DECISION AFTER WE GET THROUGH

49
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:34,403
THE GENERAL ELECTION, BUT I WILL

50
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:36,038
TELL YOU THIS, I WAS THE ONE

51
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:39,542
RECRUITED BY THE LIBERAL

52
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:40,243
ESTABLISHMENT BECAUSE OF HIS

53
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:41,411
VERY QUESTIONABLE RECORD.

54
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:43,980
ONCE AGAIN, OBAMACARE SUPPORT,

55
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,214
CAP AND TRADE SUPPORT.

56
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:47,817
DONATING TO JOE MANSON HOLDING A

57
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:48,818
FUND-RAISER AT HIS HOUSE.

58
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,221
THAT’S NOT THE WEST VIRGINIA

59
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:51,821
VALUES.

60
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:53,556
WE NEED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP IN

61
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:53,990
WASHINGTON.

62
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,959
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

63
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,659
B1 LET ME STAY WITH YOU FOR A

64
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:56,760
MOMENT

65
00:02:01,064 --> 00:02:02,999
>> THANK YOU.

66
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:03,733
UNFORTUNATELY PATRICK MORRISEY

67
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:06,469
CONTINUES TO SPEW HIS ALLIES AND

68
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:07,003
MISREPRESENTATIONS.

69
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:07,938
THEY SAID DON’T BRING OUT ANY

70
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:09,072
PAPERS.

71
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:12,709
WE HAD POLITIFACT AND ALL THE

72
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:13,443
THINGS THAT PATRICK IS SAYING,

73
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:17,114
SUPPORTING HILLARY, PLANNED

74
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:18,882
PARENTHOOD, CAP AND TRADE.

75
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:19,716
POLITIFACT WENT THROUGH EACH AND

76
00:02:19,716 --> 00:02:21,551
EVERY ALLEGATION AND SAID FALSE,

77
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:26,089
FALSE, FALSE, FALSE AND

78
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:27,024
UNFORTUNATELY PATRICK THINKS IF

79
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:29,526
YOU KEEP SAYING IT TIME AND TIME

80
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:32,129
AGAIN PEOPLE WILL THINK IT’S

81
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:32,429
TRUE.

82
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:33,497
PATRICK MORRISEY, POLITIFACT,

83
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:37,601
EVERYBODY HAS DEBUNKED

84
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:38,335
EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAID.

85
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:39,636
YOU STOOD NEXT TO ME AND ADORES

86
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:40,671
ME THREE YEARS AGO AND SAID I

87
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:42,106
WAS RIGHT FOR WEST VIRGINIA.

88
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:50,714
WHAT’S DIFFERENT NOW?

89
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:51,415
>> EVAN, I DIDN’T KNOW AT THE

90
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:54,218
TIME THAT YOU WERE WILLING TO

91
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:55,119
LIE SO MUCH AND AS MERGERS OR

92
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:57,221
WEARABLE BACKGROUND.

93
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:57,621
[BOOS]

94
00:02:57,621 --> 00:02:58,956
I WON’T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

95
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:02,927
>> Martha: MOVING RIGHT ALONG,

96
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:03,561
AN ENDORSEMENT FROM STEVE

97
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:04,895
BANNON.

98
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:09,400
PRESIDENT TRUMP RECENTLY SAID --

99
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,335
>> MY LOVE TO SPEAK ABOUT

100
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:11,702
McCONNELL?

101
00:03:11,702 --> 00:03:12,236
>> Martha: YOU WILL.

102
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:14,806
HE SAID WHEN HE WAS FIRED HE NOT

103
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:16,607
ONLY LOST HIS JOB, HE LOST HIS

104
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:17,475
MIND.

105
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:18,743
THE LAST PERSON THAT STEVE

106
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:19,844
BANNON ENDORSED WAS ROY MOORE.

107
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:20,511
IS THIS AN ASSOCIATION THAT

108
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:22,547
YOU’RE PROUD OF?

109
00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:25,750
>> I SAID AT THE TIME THAT IT

110
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,417
HAPPENED WHEN HE WENT AFTER

111
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,419
TRUMP I THOUGHT IT WAS

112
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:28,887
REPREHENSIBLE.

113
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:32,624
YOU DON’T GO AFTER FAMILY

114
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:32,957
MEMBERS.

115
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:34,325
YOU JUST DON’T DO THAT.

116
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:36,361
THOSE ARE JUST NOT WEST VIRGINIA

117
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:37,696
VALUES.

118
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:40,265
AND WHAT I WOULD ARGUE IS THAT

119
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:43,602
WE HAVE A BROAD ARRAY OF SUPPORT

120
00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:45,036
SPECTRUM.

121
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:46,838
SENATOR TED CRUZ,

122
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:47,339
SENATOR RAND PAUL.

123
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:48,006
WE HAVE WEST VIRGINIANS FOR

124
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:48,306
LIFE.

125
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:51,443
WE HAVE ALL THE PRINCIPAL

126
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:52,377
CONSERVATIVE LEADERS PACKING MY

127
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:53,278
CANDIDACY BECAUSE THEY KNOW

128
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:55,046
THERE’S A HUGE DIFFERENCE

129
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:57,149
BETWEEN MY RECORD GOING AFTER

130
00:03:57,149 --> 00:03:58,450
OBAMA’S OVERREACH AND HIS RECORD

131
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,587
AND THIS IS A FACT, RALLYING FOR

132
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:02,254
HILLARY CLINTON AND WORKING

133
00:04:02,254 --> 00:04:04,423
SIDE-BY-SIDE ON THE OBAMA TEAM.

134
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:06,425
IT TOOK HIM FIVE YEARS TO GET

135
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:09,428
OFF THE BARACK OBAMA TEAM.

136
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:11,797
THAT’S OPPORTUNISM, NOT

137
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:12,164
PRINCIPLE.

138
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,433
>> Bret: WE WILL GET THERE.

139
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,267
CONGRESSMAN JENKINS, DO YOU WANT

140
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:16,702
TO RESPOND AND WHO DID YOU VOTE

141
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:18,437
FOR IN 2008?

142
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:19,238
>> I WILL TELL YOU I DID NOT

143
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,473
VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.

144
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:23,943
I AM PROUD TO REPORT THE

145
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:25,077
REPUBLICAN.

146
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:26,645
THEY WENT BACK AND FACT-CHECKED

147
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:28,547
AND LOOK AT EVERY COMMENT I EVER

148
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:29,248
MADE AND SAID PATRICK MORRISEY

149
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:31,417
IS LYING.

150
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:32,151
THE PROBLEM IS PATRICK MORRISEY

151
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:34,553
WON’T LOOK AT THE CAMERA, WON’T

152
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:35,121
LOOK AT THE PEOPLE OF

153
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:38,758
WEST VIRGINIA AND SAY WHY HE DID

154
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:39,725
NOT VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP FOR

155
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:42,762
PRESIDENT IN THE MAY PRIMARIES.

156
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:45,998
HE’S THE ONE WHO SAID PUBLICLY

157
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:47,233
DONALD TRUMP WASN’T MY FIRST

158
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:47,567
CHOICE.

159
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:50,036
WHO WAS YOUR FIRST CHOICE?

160
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:51,070
>> LET ME BE CLEAR, AND THIS IS

161
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,439
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

162
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,173
THEN THE ONLY CANDIDATE ON THE

163
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:58,444
STAGE WHO NOT ONLY HAS VOTED FOR

164
00:04:58,444 --> 00:04:59,245
DONALD TRUMP AT THE CONVENTION

165
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:00,213
AND IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

166
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:01,614
WE SAID WE COULDN’T BRING PAPER

167
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:04,217
UP BUT I WAS ONE OF ONLY FIVE

168
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:04,951
PEOPLE IN WEST VIRGINIA TO BE

169
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:07,253
PART OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

170
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:08,421
PEOPLE THAT ARE TRUSTED TO

171
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:10,290
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT GET TO BE

172
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,392
IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

173
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:15,862
BUT EVAN JENKINS, WE KNOW IN

174
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:16,896
2008, IN 2007 ACTUALLY HE

175
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:19,633
RALLIED FOR HILLARY CLINTON.

176
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:20,533
HE SUPPORTED JOHN KERRY FOR

177
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:20,901
PRESIDENT.

178
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,569
IT’S A VERY LIBERAL BACKGROUND

179
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,771
AND YOU SAID YOUR PHILOSOPHY WAS

180
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:28,508
PROGRESSIVE MAINSTREAM BACK IN

181
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:28,809
2003.

182
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:32,079
WHAT CHANGED WITH YOU?

183
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,247
>> WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR IN THE

184
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:35,449
MAY PRIMARY IN WEST VIRGINIA?

185
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:36,249
I ENDORSED AND VOTED FOR

186
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:36,683
DONALD TRUMP.

187
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:39,052
WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR?

188
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:39,853
>> I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT AND

189
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:43,423
THAT’S WHY JUST A FEW WEEKS

190
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:44,491
AGO -- JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN

191
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:46,393
I SAT NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT AND

192
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:49,663
EVAN WAS THERE AS WELL, THAT WE

193
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:50,631
HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.

194
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:51,131
WE WORK TOGETHER.

195
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:54,201
I WAS PROUD TO RUN ADS WITH THE

196
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:54,935
PRESIDENT AND SUPPORTED HIM AT

197
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:56,270
THE CONVENTION.

198
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,839
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE --

199
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,773
EVAN SUPPORTED HIM THE DAY

200
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:03,444
BEFORE THE PRIMARY.

201
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:04,812
THAT’S NO PROFOUND COURAGE.

202
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:09,417
>> Bret: TO YOUR WISH YOUR.

203
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,252
>> CAN I GO AHEAD AND COMMENT

204
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:11,786
ABOUT SOMETHING?

205
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:13,854
>> YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT MITCH

206
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:15,256
McCONNELL?

207
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:16,557
>> THEY TALKED ABOUT IT ENOUGH

208
00:06:16,557 --> 00:06:20,061
THAT I THINK I CAN CLARIFY.

209
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:20,862
>> Bret: BOTH THESE GENTLEMEN

210
00:06:20,862 --> 00:06:22,230
MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE RULES

211
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,165
THAT YOU COULDN’T BRING PAPER,

212
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:24,465
PROPS.

213
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:25,533
YOU ARE GOING TO BRING PROPS AND

214
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:28,336
WE HAD TO KIND OF TAKE THEM AWA

215
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:28,636
AWAY.

216
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:33,441
YOU HAD THESE HATS THAT SAID

217
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:33,875
DITCH MITCH.

218
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:34,576
HE WANTED TO WEAR ONE OF THESE

219
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:34,876
HATS.

220
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:36,110
IT WAS AGAINST THE RULES.

221
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,946
SO WE SAID NO TO THAT, BUT YOU

222
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:39,847
HAVE CALLED THE SENATE MAJORITY

223
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:41,249
LEADER A HOST OF DIFFERENT

224
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,819
NAMES, INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY

225
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,955
COCAINE MITCH, IN REFERENCE TO

226
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:47,822
AN ALLEGATION THAT DRUGS WERE

227
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:50,625
FOUND ON THE SHIP IN 2014 OWNED

228
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,660
BY HIS FATHER-IN-LAW.

229
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,095
HERE’S THE QUESTION.

230
00:06:53,095 --> 00:06:54,029
IF YOU ARE ELECTED TO THE U.S.

231
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:55,730
SENATE AND MITCH McCONNELL IS

232
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,333
THE MAJORITY LEADER, HOW WILL

233
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,035
YOU GET ANYTHING DONE FOR

234
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:00,469
WEST VIRGINIA?

235
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:01,703
>> HE WILL BE THE MAJORITY

236
00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:02,237
LEADER.

237
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:03,205
LET ME CLARIFY THAT BOTH OF

238
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:04,005
THESE GUYS ARE RIGHT.

239
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:08,443
THEY ARE BOTH LYING.

240
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:09,911
ANYBODY THAT TELLS YOU THAT THEY

241
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:10,979
ARE GOING TO GO TO

242
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:11,847
WASHINGTON, D.C., AND DRAIN THE

243
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:12,881
SWAMP AND DON’T KNOW WHETHER

244
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:13,515
THEY WILL VOTE FOR MITCH

245
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:16,018
McCONNELL ARE NOT IS NOT

246
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,286
TELLING YOU THE TRUTH BECAUSE

247
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:19,321
McCONNELL HAS TO GO TO DRAIN

248
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:20,255
THE SWAMP.

249
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:22,357
WHEN HE WENT TO D.C. 35 YEARS

250
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:23,959
AGO THE NATIONAL DEBT WAS

251
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,029
$2 TRILLION AND NOW THE NATIONAL

252
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,432
DEBT IS $22 TRILLION.

253
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:31,033
$20 TRILLION WHILE MITCH

254
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,901
McCONNELL HAS BEEN THERE.

255
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:33,569
HE HAS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

256
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:36,238
WITH CHINA.

257
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:37,940
HIS FAMILY IS VERY POWERFUL IN

258
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,275
CHINA AND VERY POWERFUL IN THE

259
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:40,075
UNITED STATES.

260
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,443
ONE OF THE FATE OF THE

261
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:43,879
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO FACE

262
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,613
IS ECONOMIC DEALINGS WITH CHINA

263
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:49,051
WHERE THEY NOW HAVE THE

264
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,319
$358 BILLION SURPLUS OVER US AND

265
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:50,820
TRADE.

266
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,988
HE’S ALSO GOING TO FACE ISSUES

267
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:53,823
ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AND A WHOLE

268
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:54,490
SOURCE OF OTHER THINGS.

269
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,559
MITCH McCONNELL WAS ONE OF THE

270
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,428
FEW SENATORS THAT VOTED AFTER

271
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:00,730
TIANANMEN SQUARE NOT TO HAVE

272
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,433
PUNITIVE ACTIONS AGAINST CHINA

273
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:04,634
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

274
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:07,103
THEY KILLED 500,000         500T

275
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:07,637
TIANANMEN SQUARE.

276
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,505
YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHAT HE’S

277
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:09,806
DOING.

278
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:14,210
IF HE WANTS SOMETHING ELSE

279
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,045
COMING HE INTERFERES WITH

280
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:16,913
ELECTIONS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY.

281
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,648
HE IS INTERFERING WITH THIS

282
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:19,916
ELECTION.

283
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,518
HOW ARE THESE GUYS GOING TO

284
00:08:21,518 --> 00:08:23,620
STAND UP WHEN HE TELLS THEM TO

285
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,122
SIT DOWN WHEN SCHUMER TELLS JOE

286
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:27,457
MANCHIN TO SIT DOWN, WHEN THEY

287
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:29,793
ARE GOING TO BE HOLDING FOR HIM

288
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:30,860
FOR HAVING ELECTED THEM.

289
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,629
THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE SO

290
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:34,831
MUCH POWER IS THEY CONTROL THESE

291
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:36,600
SUPER PACS AND IF THESE SUPER

292
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,034
PACS THAT THESE GUYS ARE AFRAID

293
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:39,034
OF AND THAT’S WHAT JOE MANCHIN

294
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:41,037
PROBABLY MEANS WHEN HE SAYS THAT

295
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:42,139
SCHUMER IS TOO POWERFUL.

296
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,874
McCONNELL IS NO DIFFERENT.

297
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:44,741
IF THEY TELL YOU THEY’RE GOING

298
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:45,575
TO DRAIN THE SWAMP BUT THEY

299
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:47,344
DON’T KNOW IF THEY WILL VOTE FOR

300
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:49,246
McCONNELL OR NOT, CAN’T BE

301
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:49,546
TRUE.

302
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:52,583
>> Bret: LET ME JUST CLARIFY

303
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:52,916
HERE --

304
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,283
[APPLAUSE]

305
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,451
>> Bret: LET ME JUST CLARIFY.

306
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,086
WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MITCH

307
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:56,753
McCONNELL’S FAMILY YOU ARE

308
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,623
TALKING ABOUT THE FATHER OF THE

309
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,425
CURRENT SECRETARY OF

310
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:02,259
TRANSPORTATION,

311
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:05,863
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S SECRETARY OF

312
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:06,730
TRANSPORTATION, THE FATHER WHO

313
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,700
YOU CALLED A CHINA PERSON.

314
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,235
SHE IS A KEY DECIDER IN

315
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:12,436
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WHICH

316
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:13,604
MIGHT BE A BIG DEAL IN

317
00:09:13,604 --> 00:09:14,038
WEST VIRGINIA.

318
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:16,040
HOW DO YOU GET ALONG AND GET

319
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,441
THINGS DONE BY SLINGING INSULTS

320
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:18,042
LIKE THAT?

321
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,577
>> I’M NOT GOING TO D.C. TO GET

322
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:22,213
ALONG, SO THAT WILL BE A FAILURE

323
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:23,447
BECAUSE I DON’T INTEND TO GET

324
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:23,781
ALONG.

325
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:25,883
I INTEND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

326
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:26,384
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

327
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:29,920
THIS IDEA THAT CALLING SOMEONE A

328
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,956
CHINA PERSON -- I’M AN AMERICAN

329
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:33,057
PERSON.

330
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:34,959
I DON’T SEE THIS INSINUATION BY

331
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,227
THE PRESS THAT THERE’S SOMETHING

332
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:37,662
RACIST ABOUT SAYING CHINA

333
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:38,262
PERSON.

334
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:40,264
SOME PEOPLE ARE KOREAN PERSONS

335
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:41,666
SOME OF THEM ARE AFRICAN

336
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,033
PERSONS.

337
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:43,668
IT’S NOT ANY SLANDER THERE.

338
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:44,802
BUT BOTH FAMILIES ARE VERY

339
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:47,839
POWERFUL IN BOTH COUNTRIES.

340
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,040
I’VE PREVIOUSLY BEEN ON THE

341
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,875
BOARD OF FOUR OR FIVE MAJOR

342
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,076
CORPORATIONS.

343
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:53,678
YOU DO NOT SEND FAMILY MEMBERS

344
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:54,579
OUT TO NEGOTIATE PURCHASES AND

345
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:57,248
DEALS WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS.

346
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:57,882
IT’S CALLED A CONFLICT OF

347
00:09:57,882 --> 00:09:59,284
INTEREST.

348
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:00,485
>> Martha: WE WANT TO GET A

349
00:10:00,485 --> 00:10:01,252
QUICK ANSWER IF WE CAN FROM EACH

350
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:04,089
ONE OF YOU ON THIS.

351
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:04,823
RIGHT NOW THERE IS A BIPARTISAN

352
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:07,492
BILL IN CONGRESS TO PREVENT

353
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:09,027
PRESIDENT FROM BEING ABLE TO

354
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:11,263
FIRE ROBERT MUELLER, THE SPECIAL

355
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:12,497
COUNSEL IN THE INVESTIGATION.

356
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:13,164
IN OTHER WORDS, SHOULD THE

357
00:10:13,164 --> 00:10:16,067
PRESIDENT HAVE THE RIGHT TO FIRE

358
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,070
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL?

359
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:18,870
MR. MORRISSEY FIRST.

360
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,838
>> THE PRESIDENT IS THE HEAD OF

361
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:21,506
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND I DO

362
00:10:21,506 --> 00:10:24,743
THINK HE HAS A LOT OF SAY OVER

363
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:26,244
WHO WAS IN HIS JUSTICE

364
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:26,678
DEPARTMENT.

365
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:28,080
WITH RESPECT TO THE MUELLER

366
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,147
INVESTIGATION, I THINK IT NEEDS

367
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:30,449
TO COME TO AN END.

368
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:31,483
IT’S A WITCH HUNT.

369
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:32,985
WE NEED TO STOP THAT.

370
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:34,386
>> Martha: DO THINK THE

371
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:35,654
PRESIDENT SHOULD FIRE ROBERT

372
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:35,988
MUELLER?

373
00:10:35,988 --> 00:10:36,922
>> I THINK THIS SHOULD COME TO

374
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:37,289
AN END.

375
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:39,358
IF IT CAME TO AN END VERY

376
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:41,260
QUICKLY THAT WE WOULDN’T HAVE TO

377
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,261
DEAL WITH ALL THIS ENDLESS

378
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:45,064
STRING OF ACCUSATIONS.

379
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:45,664
IT’S DISTRACTING TO THE

380
00:10:45,664 --> 00:10:46,465
PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT HAS

381
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:47,800
DONE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD THINGS

382
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,836
FOR WEST VIRGINIA AND OUR

383
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:52,438
COUNTRY.

384
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:54,039
DEREGULATING THE ECONOMY, GOOD

385
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,640
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

386
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,409
HE’S DOING A LOT OF POSITIVE

387
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:56,742
THINGS.

388
00:10:56,742 --> 00:10:58,044
I THINK THAT’S A SIDESHOW AND IT

389
00:10:58,044 --> 00:10:59,712
SHOULD COME TO AN END.

390
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:00,880
>> Martha: PFISTER TRINKETS,

391
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,981
BIPARTISAN GROUP THAT GOT

392
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:02,715
TOGETHER, THEY WOULD LIKE TO

393
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:03,449
RESTRICT THE PRESIDENT ON THIS,

394
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:06,652
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

395
00:11:06,652 --> 00:11:08,854
>> I AM VERY CLEAR, AND THIS

396
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:14,460
INVESTIGATION NOW.

397
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,195
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

398
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:21,034
I’VE SEEN THE DOCUMENTS, I’VE

399
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:22,869
SEEN COMEY’S OUTRAGEOUS LEAKS.

400
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:25,538
I HAVE SEEN THE WITCH HUNT THAT

401
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:27,407
HAS GONE AFTER THIS

402
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:28,842
ADMINISTRATION.

403
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:30,276
THE DEMOCRATS CAN’T GIVE UP ON

404
00:11:30,276 --> 00:11:33,246
THE RESULTS OF 2016.

405
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:33,847
THEY ARE FIGHTING THIS

406
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:36,349
ADMINISTRATION EACH AND EVERY

407
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:36,616
DAY.

408
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:40,453
AND THIS INVESTIGATION NOW.

409
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:42,789
>> Martha: MR. BLANKENSHIP?

410
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:43,924
>> I HAD A LITTLE PERSONAL

411
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:44,624
EXPERIENCE WITH THE DEPARTMENT

412
00:11:44,624 --> 00:11:48,061
OF JUSTICE.

413
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:51,031
[LAUGHTER]

414
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:54,434
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

415
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:55,569
>> THEY LIE A LOT TOO.

416
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:57,404
IT’S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE

417
00:11:57,404 --> 00:11:59,339
WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY GOES

418
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,441
ON IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

419
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:03,043
YOU WONDER WHERE THIS COUNTRY IS

420
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:04,044
GOING, IT’S REALLY CRAZY.

421
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:06,346
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION,

422
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:07,347
HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE ENDED

423
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:09,049
BEFORE I GET THERE IN JANUARY,

424
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:10,451
SO IT SHOULD BE OKAY.

425
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:12,653
>> Bret: TO EVERYONE ON THE

426
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:13,854
STAGER, ASK A QUESTION TO

427
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:14,655
EVERYONE, THIS IS ON THE ISSUE

428
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:17,491
OF COAL.

429
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:18,659
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN IS WORKING

430
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:19,827
WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

431
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:21,629
TRYING TO PROTECT THE COAL

432
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:22,663
INDUSTRY BY INVOKING A NATIONAL

433
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:24,164
SECURITY LAW DECADES-OLD MUCH

434
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:26,300
LIKE THEY HAVE DONE FOR THE

435
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,668
STEEL AND ALUMINUM INDUSTRIES.

436
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:30,104
DO YOU AGREE WITH THE SENATOR ON

437
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:31,072
THAT?

438
00:12:31,072 --> 00:12:32,673
MR. BLANKENSHIP?

439
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:33,307
>> ON THE TERRACE?

440
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:35,176
>> Bret: TRYING TO PROTECT THE

441
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:37,211
COAL INDUSTRY USING THAT SAME

442
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:38,679
WALL.

443
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,413
>> I THINK THAT THE PROTECTION

444
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:42,350
HAS TO BE USED VERY CAREFULLY.

445
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,453
I DO AGREE WITH IT IN THIS CASE.

446
00:12:45,453 --> 00:12:46,587
WE GOT SO MANY PRODUCTS COMING

447
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:48,289
IN THE U.S., WHETHER IT’S STEEL,

448
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:49,490
COAL, WHATEVER.

449
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,894
THE HUMAN RIGHT VIOLATIONS WITH

450
00:12:52,894 --> 00:12:54,662
PEOPLE THAT AREN’T BEING PAID

451
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:55,797
INTO A GREAT EXTENT THIS COUNTRY

452
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:57,265
HAS BEEN A VICTIM OF THAT.

453
00:12:57,265 --> 00:12:59,267
ALL THE WORKERS IN THE

454
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:00,869
UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN VICTIMS

455
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:07,909
PURCHASES DO NOT PAY ANY TAXES

456
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:10,645
FOR THE ROADS, THEY DO NOT PAY

457
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:11,479
TAXES FOR SOCIAL SECURITY.

458
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:12,647
THEY DO NOT PAY TAXES FOR YOUR

459
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:14,683
MEDICAL CARE SO WHEN YOU BUY

460
00:13:14,683 --> 00:13:16,651
THAT PRODUCT IT LOOKS

461
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:17,352
INEXPENSIVE BUT IT’S ACTUALLY

462
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:19,688
VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE IF THOSE

463
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:20,789
PRODUCTS WERE BEING MADE BY

464
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:22,357
AMERICAN WORKERS THEY WOULD BE

465
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:23,458
PAYING TAXES THAT WOULD HELP

466
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,061
BALANCE THE BUDGET, HELP PROVIDE

467
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:27,395
MEDICAL CARE, HELP GET PEOPLE

468
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:28,797
OFF THE STREET AND FIX THE

469
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:31,466
OPIOID EPIDEMIC.

470
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:32,868
IT’S A VERY DANGEROUS, SLIPPERY

471
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:34,169
SLOPE TO GO DOWN AND THAT NEEDS

472
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:35,270
TO BE DONE ANALYTICALLY AND IT

473
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,472
NEEDS TO BE A SITUATION WHERE

474
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:38,240
ALL 132 COUNTRIES ARE LOOKED AT

475
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,108
IN TERMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS

476
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:41,944
VIOLATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL

477
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:43,278
STEWARDSHIP AND WHATEVER ELSE

478
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:45,481
YOU WANT TO CONSIDER END OF THE

479
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:47,483
PRODUCTS NEED TO BE LOOKED AT

480
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:49,184
INDIVIDUALLY AND WE NEED TO TAX

481
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:51,053
THE PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN MAKE

482
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:52,087
COST-EFFECTIVELY HERE AND

483
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:55,324
PROVIDE AMERICAN JOBS.

484
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:55,858
>> Bret: [APPLAUSE]

485
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:55,958
ON THE

486
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,262
SAME THING --

487
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:01,463
>> I THINK WE NEED TO DO

488
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:02,798
EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE TO BRING

489
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:03,165
COAL BACK.

490
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:05,468
HERE’S WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE

491
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:05,968
LAST EIGHT YEARS.

492
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:07,503
UNDER BARACK OBAMA HE HAD AN

493
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:08,237
ABSOLUTE ASSAULT ON COAL MINERS

494
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:10,606
JOBS AND WHEN I GOT IN IN 2013 I

495
00:14:10,606 --> 00:14:15,244
SUED THE EPA.

496
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:17,513
BY 2016 WE HAVE THAT HISTORIC

497
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:18,881
SUPREME COURT WIN STOPPING

498
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:19,448
PRESIDENT OBAMA’S TOP

499
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:20,783
INITIATIVE.

500
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:21,484
THAT WAS A BIG WIN.

501
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:24,554
WE SAVED THOUSANDS OF COAL MINER

502
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:24,854
JOBS.

503
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:25,621
A LOT OF DAMAGE WAS DONE BY THE

504
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:27,457
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

505
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:28,257
THEY BASICALLY TRY TO FORCE

506
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:31,260
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UTILITIES TO

507
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,162
FORCE UTILITIES TO CLOSE DOWN,

508
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:34,130
STOP BURNING AS MUCH COAL.

509
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,667
I DO THINK WHETHER IT’S LOOKING

510
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,469
AT ISSUES OF NATIONAL SECURITY

511
00:14:39,469 --> 00:14:40,403
OR MY RECENT PROPOSAL, WHICH IS

512
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:45,475
GOING TO JURY RIG, SPIT UP THE

513
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:46,342
AMOUNT OF THAT COAL PRODUCTION

514
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:47,610
IN OUR COUNTRY BY RELIEVING THEM

515
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,045
OF SOME OF THE REGULATORY

516
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:51,014
BURDENS IN PLACE AT THE EPA, WE

517
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:53,650
SHOULD DO ALL OF THE ABOVE TO

518
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,852
MAKE SURE THAT WEST VIRGINIA HAS

519
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,354
A CHANCE TO RECOUP BECAUSE IT

520
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,722
WAS A WAR ON WEST VIRGINIA.

521
00:14:58,722 --> 00:14:59,422
>> Bret: LET ME ASK YOU THIS

522
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:01,658
JUST QUICKLY.

523
00:15:01,658 --> 00:15:03,393
IF YOU DID THAT, HOW DOES THAT

524
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:06,163
MATCH UP WITH YOUR SMALL

525
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:08,198
CONSERVATIVE VALUES, SMALLER

526
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,466
GOVERNMENT?

527
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:11,468
WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING HERE.

528
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:12,369
DO YOU THINK SENATOR TED CRUZ

529
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,670
ARE CENTERED AROUND PAUL WOULD

530
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,272
BE FOR DOING WHAT YOU ARE

531
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:15,639
PROPOSING?

532
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:18,041
>> I THINK THAT ALL OF THIS IS

533
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,276
CONSISTENT WITH GETTING BACK TO

534
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:20,744
A PLACE -- ONE BARACK OBAMA SAYS

535
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:23,080
HE’S GOING TO PUT A WHOLE

536
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,981
INDUSTRY AND COAL MINERS OUT OF

537
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:25,683
BUSINESS, ALL WE ARE TRYING TO

538
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:27,451
DO IS GET BACK TO SOME LEVEL

539
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:28,986
PLAYING FIELD TO BE ABLE TO

540
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:32,256
ALLOW COAL MINERS TO MIND AGAIN.

541
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:33,190
I THINK IT TAKES ENSURING THAT

542
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,927
THERE WILL BE MARKETS.

543
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:38,062
I’M THE MOST FREE-MARKET GUY

544
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,897
HERE ON THE STAGE BUT I WOULD

545
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,631
SAY THIS, WHEN YOU HAVE DAMAGE

546
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:42,933
THAT IS INFLICTED THAT IS SO

547
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:44,969
SEVERE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

548
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:46,203
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN MINE

549
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:51,275
AND SELL COAL AGAIN.

550
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:51,976
>> I THINK YOU ARE GIVING JOE

551
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:56,013
MANCHIN WAY TOO MUCH CREDIT.

552
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:56,747
YOU ARE REPEATING EXACTLY WHAT

553
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,015
HE WOULD LIKE TO THINK.

554
00:15:58,015 --> 00:15:58,749
THE PROBLEM IS JOE IS NOT A

555
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,718
FIGHTER FOR COAL.

556
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:03,187
HE SAYS ONE THING AND HE DOES

557
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:03,521
ANOTHER.

558
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:05,189
JOE MANCHIN SUPPORTED

559
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:06,524
BARACK OBAMA.

560
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:08,860
JOE MANCHIN FOUGHT HARD TO ELECT

561
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,396
HILLARY CLINTON.

562
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:15,867
HE IS CAUSING OUR PAIN.

563
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:19,104
I STOOD THERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE

564
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:23,475
SIGNED THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION

565
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:24,342
