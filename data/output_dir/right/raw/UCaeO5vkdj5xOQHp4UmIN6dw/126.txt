1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,480
- Uh, so I'm Robert,

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,770
I'm one of the Coastal
Liberals as you'd say.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,320
I've been watching you for years now,

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,570
and I read your book on the arguments

5
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,400
to fight against people like me

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,020
and I feel bad, cause
like for the most part,

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,720
the people have been
arguing against you aren't

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,113
nearly as eloquent as they should be.

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,023
But I would just like to ask,

10
00:00:18,023 --> 00:00:21,260
so one of your points you
very strongly make is that

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,310
it's unfair for people
like me to label you

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,490
as like a racist or a bigot
just as like a smear tactic,

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,820
but have you ever acknowledged that like

14
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,130
maybe its not a smear tactic,

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,410
but it's based on things you've said.

16
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,970
So like, for example, on the
Israel-Palestine conflict,

17
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,530
you know you called the Arabs,

18
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,063
yeah, you already know what I'm gonna say.

19
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:39,031
(audience laughs)

20
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:40,610
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I
don't mean to presume...

21
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,055
Yeah, so, but you say...

22
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:43,030
- [Guest Speaker] I've written several

23
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,740
full columns about it.

24
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,080
I've talked about how people

25
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,940
don't read the follow-up tweets.

26
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,870
I wrote a column.

27
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,703
- I've read some of the tweets,

28
00:00:49,703 --> 00:00:50,900
and the tweets were just as bad,

29
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,160
I mean you say a lot of things
that are like racist, right,

30
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
but then if I call you a
racist you defend it by saying

31
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,730
like, I didn't read enough, right?

32
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,770
So what I was going to say before.

33
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,280
- Okay, fine. So give me my
racist tweets in context.

34
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,608
- Okay, well.

35
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:06,140
- [Guest Speaker] You came prepared,

36
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,473
so great, go, go, do it.

37
00:01:07,473 --> 00:01:10,420
- So you said that Arabs like to bomb crap

38
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,450
and live in open sewage.

39
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,283
It's not a difficult day.

40
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:14,991
Oh, before that you said
Israeli's like to build.

41
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,358
- [Guest Speaker] Okay now the follow up,

42
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:18,603
cause you said the follow ups
didn't make it any better.

43
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,021
- There is separate things that you said

44
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:21,854
that were also pretty bad.

45
00:01:21,854 --> 00:01:22,687
- [Guest Speaker] No,
no I want the follow ups

46
00:01:22,687 --> 00:01:23,553
to that one, though.

47
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:24,386
Would you like me to get them?

48
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:25,219
I'll get them for you.

49
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,834
- [Robert] If you have them, sure.

50
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:28,881
- What was that?

51
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,539
- Do you mind if I
continue while you do that?

52
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:31,372
- [Guest Speaker] Well, I'd
like to take them one by one,

53
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:32,205
so if you.
- Sure.

54
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:33,038
- Why don't we do this,

55
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:34,875
why don't we delay that one until the end

56
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,344
while I look this up from the
podium in front of 600 people.

57
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:41,177
(audience applauding)
- Okay,

58
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,570
so on that particular issue, you also said

59
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,056
that the Arab-Palestine populist is

60
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:51,230
by and large constitutes
the most evil population

61
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,180
on the face of the planet.

62
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,880
Before you said that you
never brought up religion

63
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,330
when it comes to abortion,
but I don't think that you've

64
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,550
avoided religion when it
comes to the Israeli conflict

65
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,800
and I don't know that you
can be completely unbiased

66
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,130
on the issue, given that you know, you're.

67
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,320
- Well, I can be unbiased on
the subject that Palestinians

68
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,860
have elected three terrorist governments

69
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,020
to form a unity government
with the stated goal

70
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,240
of the destruction of the state of Israel

71
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,509
and the murder of all Jews in the area.

72
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,640
So that I can be relatively unbiased on.

73
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,395
As far as the idea that
the Palestinian population

74
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:17,562
(audience applauding)

75
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,760
As far as the idea that
the Palestinians population

76
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,330
is more evil than other populations,

77
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,720
they certainly hold more evil views

78
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,700
than other populations by poll statistics,

79
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,840
by how many Palestinians
approve of terror attacks,

80
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,120
by how many Palestinians voted for

81
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,350
an actual terror group, Hamas,

82
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,560
and another actual terror
group, Palestinian Authority,

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,250
and another actual terrorist
group, the Islamic Jihad.

84
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,390
Okay, so I don't think
that all views are equal

85
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,590
and I don't think that
people who hold evil views

86
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,843
are necessarily good.

87
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,210
I mean I'm sorry if the polls
don't support the idea that

88
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,980
everyone is equally wonderful,

89
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,706
but everyone is not equally wonderful.

90
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,830
Okay so I'm looking up
the statements now, so

91
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,378
if you'd like to give me a second.

92
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:57,083
- Yeah, you deny secular Zionism and you.

93
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,504
- [Guest Speaker] Quote,
okay so here, I've got them

94
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:00,337
- Okay, go ahead with that.

95
00:03:00,337 --> 00:03:01,470
- Let's finish that one
and then we can move.

96
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,460
There are many, many
Christian and Muslim Arabs

97
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,700
who are wonderful people,
just not the ones who oppose

98
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,120
Israeli-Israel Arab conflict.

99
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,460
That would be the response,

100
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,700
within the same twitter thread.

101
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,020
Okay, in the post re: Israelis
vs Arabs, I wrote about

102
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,030
Arabs who take part in
the Israelis-Arab conflict

103
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,836
as anyone who can read knows, #dumbasses.

104
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:22,900
(audience laughing)

105
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,850
Quote, "I think it has much
more to do with the fact

106
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,920
that Palestinian leadership
supported by the Palestinian

107
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,550
population uses millions for terror.

108
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,750
I should have been more specific.

109
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,380
Arabs who actively seek
Israel's destruction".

110
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,920
Those would be the follow-up tweets.

111
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,850
Does that sounds like a
genocidal maniac to you,

112
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,470
or does it sound like
I'm specifically labeling

113
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,620
a group of people who have
called for Israel's destruction?

114
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,540
- I'd like to point out
that you're not a racist,

115
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,029
but they're dumbasses and
you're allowed to insult them.

116
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:46,750
- [Guest Speaker] Yes, because
someone calls me a racist

117
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,411
without evidence they are
definitionally a dumbass.

118
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:50,887
- What is Genocide, wait,

119
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:52,184
(audience applauds)

120
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:55,594
I'll try to finish, I'll
try to finish it up.

121
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:58,240
It's hard when everyone keeps
clapping to what he says.

122
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,384
Uh, what is genocide, like
the ah, after, you said

123
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:04,320
you want to be like Churchill, right,

124
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,560
and after the allies when
they moved the German-speaking

125
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,730
Polish out of Poland,

126
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,791
- So now you're talking
about a comment I wrote

127
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,509
when I was 19 years old
that I, that I actually

128
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:16,509
morally abhorred and denounced
myself, I think 6 years ago?

129
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,270
And have repeatedly said was
a bad column that I wrote

130
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,693
when I was 19 years old?

131
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:26,620
- Okay, so next.

132
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,700
- I wish I had more
time, like, do you wanna,

133
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,460
do you wanna get a drink sometime,

134
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,710
like a non-alcoholic beverage?

135
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,543
- [Guest Speaker] What was
that, say one more time?

136
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:34,349
- Do you wanna get a
non-alcoholic drink sometime?

137
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:35,638
cause I got a lot here.

138
00:04:35,638 --> 00:04:36,471
I really do.

139
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:37,410
(cross-talk drowns out speaker)

140
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,380
Let me just say this,

141
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,030
for everything that you are going to say.

142
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,710
I've addressed literally
every one of those points.

143
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,470
I have a column that I put out,

144
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,380
probably, only a few months ago,

145
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,517
and the literal title of it is

146
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:47,750
"So here's a giant list of

147
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,240
all the dumb stuff I've ever done".

148
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,500
Don't worry I'll keep updating it.

149
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,970
- I didn't get that one in my research,

150
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,641
so I do apologize if I've
misrepresented, like,

151
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,416
my research wasn't, it
will be so thorough,

152
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,280
cause it was pretty much
a last minute decision

153
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,910
to start, like really
going and trying to ask you

154
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,172
a question.

155
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:02,005
- And again, that's totally fine,

156
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:02,860
and I appreciate you coming,

157
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,430
and I appreciate you
asking me the questions,

158
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,360
but if the notion is that I'm a racist

159
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,900
before you actually read
all my responses today

160
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,240
- Not, not I mean,
racist is just one part,

161
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,660
I also like the transgender,

162
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,051
like you don't believe
in transgenders, and like

163
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:13,884
(cross-talk drowns out speaker)

164
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:15,572
- Well, I don't know what that means,

165
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:16,920
don't believe in transgenders, I mean.

166
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,233
Transgender people exist.

167
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:21,887
(audience laughing)

168
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:24,330
- Yeah, you've said gender
and sex are the same thing.

169
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,980
You think they're synonymous.

170
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,130
- I said gender and sex are linked,

171
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,000
I said femininity and masculinity

172
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,520
are linked to male and female

173
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,440
- [Robert] Just before you said it there.

174
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,430
- Right, there are two genders.

175
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,900
I don't believe there are 1000 genders

176
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,620
and if I think that you're defining gender

177
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,520
as just a random series
of societal constructs,

178
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,353
then there aren't two genders,

179
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:40,670
there are infinite numbers of genders

180
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,470
because everybody is a mix
of feminine and masculine

181
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,790
so why restrict it to 70 genders,
make it 6 billion genders

182
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,987
since we all have our unique mix

183
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:50,133
of what male and female constitute.

184
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:53,800
And yes, I don think that
there can be such a thing

185
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,422
as a male a in female's body.

186
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:58,220
I don't think that there's a
female in a male's body and

187
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,940
I find the logic to support that

188
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,120
and the science to support
that utterly lacking.

189
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,080
- [Robert] Yeah, so, again...

190
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,820
- I'd be happy to get a
non-alcoholic beverage with you

191
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,164
and discuss it more fully.

192
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:08,997
(audience laughing)

193
00:06:08,997 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Guest Speaker] Thank you for coming.
