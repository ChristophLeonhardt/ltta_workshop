1
00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:09,985
KNEEL KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF

2
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:11,152
THIS IS EXACTLY WORTHY OF A

3
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:12,354
FOX NEWS ALERT.

4
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:13,722
BUT A FOX NEWS POLL THAT

5
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,090
REALLY ISN'T TOO JOLTING BUT

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,425
COULD BE A SORT OF A WIND AT

7
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:18,426
THE PRESIDENT'S BACK TWO OUT

8
00:00:18,426 --> 00:00:21,196
OF THREE OF AMERICANS

9
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:22,030
SUPPORT SUMMIT IS HE GOING

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,198
TO BE HAVING WITH KIM JONG

11
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:23,465
UN.

12
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:25,500
THE U.S. AND NORTH KOREA, IF

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,768
THEY ACTUALLY COME AWAY FROM

14
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:30,405
THIS WITH SOMETHING, EVEN IF

15
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,141
IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE

16
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:33,875
HIGH-POPPING PROGRESS BUT

17
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:34,809
SOMETHING, THEN IT COULD

18
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:35,510
CHANGE EVERYTHING.

19
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,945
NOW, OF COURSE, WHAT WOULD

20
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,246
SOMETHING BE?

21
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,448
THE AUTHOR OF THE OPERATOR,

22
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,716
FORMER NAVY SEAL ROB O'NEILL

23
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:42,584
WITH ME.

24
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,385
ROB, GOOD TO HAVE YOU.

25
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:45,620
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME,

26
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:45,987
NEIL.

27
00:00:45,987 --> 00:00:47,188
>> Neil: ONE EVER THE COMMON

28
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:49,658
PHRASES WE HEAR, ROB IS

29
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:50,792
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

30
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:51,393
KOREAN PENINSULA.

31
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:53,128
BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT'S AN

32
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:53,628
INTEGRAL ISSUE.

33
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:54,963
WE HAVE VERY BIG DIFFERENCES

34
00:00:54,963 --> 00:00:55,630
ON THE TIMETABLE.

35
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,665
WE WANT IT FAST.

36
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:57,899
THE NORTH KOREANS NOT SO

37
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:58,199
FAST.

38
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,234
>> THERE ARE SO MANY

39
00:00:59,234 --> 00:00:59,868
ARGUMENTS WITH THAT.

40
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:01,069
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING

41
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:02,203
THAT KIM JONG UN IS SORT OF

42
00:01:02,203 --> 00:01:03,405
PLAYING ALONG, KNOWING THAT

43
00:01:03,405 --> 00:01:04,272
PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD BE OUT

44
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,840
IN A FEW YEARS, SEVEN YEARS

45
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,374
AT THE MOST.

46
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:07,742
AND THEN HE COULD PLAY THE

47
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:08,710
NEXT ADMINISTRATION, WHICH

48
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,448
IS GRANDFATHERED KIM --

49
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,115
>> Neil: HOW LIKELY DO YOU

50
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:14,582
THINK THAT IS.

51
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:15,250
>> I DON'T THINK IT IS.

52
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,218
I THINK WITH A LOT OF THE

53
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:18,153
TECHNOLOGY COMING UP, KIM

54
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:19,454
JONG UN WANTS TO MAINTAIN

55
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:19,754
POWER.

56
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:20,955
THE WAY HE MAINTAINS POWER

57
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,257
IS WITHOUT AN INVASION OF

58
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:22,991
HIS COUNTRY.

59
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:24,859
HE REALLY WANTS TO AVOID AN

60
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:25,226
INVASION.

61
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:25,927
THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS

62
00:01:25,927 --> 00:01:28,363
THAT HE WAS SAYING IN THE

63
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:29,064
DEMILITARIZED ZONE AND IN

64
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:30,231
SOUTH KOREA IF WE CAN

65
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:31,666
GUARANTEE THE U.S. WILL NOT

66
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:32,567
INVADE WHICH WE DON'T HAVE

67
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,102
INTEREST IN DOING, HE GETS

68
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:35,503
TO SORT OF MAINTAIN POWER

69
00:01:35,503 --> 00:01:36,838
AND THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT

70
00:01:36,838 --> 00:01:38,440
BALL OF WAX ONCE THEY GET

71
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,774
THE TECHNOLOGY IN THERE IF

72
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:41,376
HE GETS TO KEEP POWER WITH

73
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,676
NUKES.

74
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:42,577
HE KNOWS THAT IS A

75
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:42,944
DETERRENT.

76
00:01:42,944 --> 00:01:44,713
IF HE CAN GET RID OF THEM,

77
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:46,314
HOPEFULLY RELEASING SOME OF

78
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,916
THE -- SOME OF THE PRESSURE

79
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:48,817
OF THE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS,

80
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,218
HE GETS MORE STUFF IN THERE,

81
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:51,186
HIS PEOPLE, NOT THAT HE

82
00:01:51,186 --> 00:01:52,287
REALLY CARES ABOUT HIS

83
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:54,122
PEOPLE, IF THEY GET FED,

84
00:01:54,122 --> 00:01:55,790
THAT, AGAIN, WILL WILL COME

85
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,025
WITH HIM MAINTAINING POWER.

86
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,927
JUST TO GET A FACE TO FACE

87
00:01:58,927 --> 00:01:59,861
WITH THE LEADER OF THE FREE

88
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:01,262
WORLD WHICH NO ONE IN NORTH

89
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:02,363
KOREA EVER HAS, THAT'S A

90
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:03,398
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

91
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:04,833
CAN HE HEAR FACE TO FACE,

92
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,701
ALONG WITH AN INVITE TO

93
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:07,435
MAR-A-LAGO OR THE WHITE

94
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:07,736
HOUSE.

95
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:09,336
HE WANTS TO BE LEGITIMIZED

96
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:10,205
AND KEEP HIS POWER.

97
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:11,339
THIS IS DEFINITELY A STEP IN

98
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,173
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

99
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,908
EVEN IF NOTHING COMES OUT OF

100
00:02:13,908 --> 00:02:14,876
IT, THEY HAVE ALREADY

101
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:15,710
STARTED NEGOTIATING ONCE

102
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,778
THEY CALLED IT OFF AND PUT

103
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:18,079
IT BACK ON, PRESIDENT TRUMP

104
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,215
IS GOING TO LEAVE THE G-7

105
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:21,649
SUMMIT TOMORROW TO GET THERE

106
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:22,183
EARLY.

107
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,451
THIS IS GREAT STEP IN

108
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:25,153
FOREIGN POLICY.

109
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:25,754
>> Neil: YOU NEVER LIKE

110
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:26,855
BEING CALLED A HERO THE

111
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,759
TAKEDOWN OF USAMA BIN LADEN.

112
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,761
YOU CATEGORIZE THAT IN MY

113
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:33,294
BOOK.

114
00:02:33,294 --> 00:02:35,263
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF WE DO

115
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:36,231
NORMALIZE RELATIONS AND DOWN

116
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:37,198
THE ROAD THERE IS KIM JONG

117
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,133
UN AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH

118
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:38,833
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

119
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,167
STATES?

120
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,068
>> IT'S A TOUGH ONE.

121
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:41,369
I MEAN PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

122
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,137
INVITED VLADIMIR PUTIN, TOO.

123
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:43,338
A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE LEFT

124
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:45,140
ARE SAYING, YOU KNOW, YOU

125
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,674
BRING -- YOU KNOW, HE IS A

126
00:02:46,674 --> 00:02:48,810
GUY THAT TORTURES HIS OWN

127
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,210
PEOPLE.

128
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:49,878
>> Neil: WE CAN'T PICK AND

129
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,912
CHOOSE THE LEADERS MUCH THE

130
00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:52,046
COUNTRIES HE WANTS TO GO TO.

131
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,148
>> LOOK AT SOME OF THE

132
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:54,983
PEOPLE WHO CALL OUR ALLIES I

133
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:55,884
WOULD RATHER BE STABBED IN

134
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:56,851
THE FRONT THAN THE BACK.

135
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:57,952
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT IT IS.

136
00:02:57,952 --> 00:02:59,087
MAYBE HE COMES AROUND.

137
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:00,188
LOOK AT PAKISTAN.

138
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:02,090
OKAY, WE GIVE THEM MILLIONS

139
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,525
AND MILLIONS, HUNDREDS OF

140
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:04,959
MILLIONS IN AID.

141
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,461
THEY HID BIN LADEN ON US.

142
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:08,897
THEY HIDE THE HAQQANI

143
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,230
NETWORK.

144
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,834
DO WE JUST IGNORE?

145
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:13,701
>> Neil: FDR COULDN'T PICK

146
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:14,602
AND CHOOSE THE LEADER OF

147
00:03:14,602 --> 00:03:15,670
RUSSIA WHICH HE WAS TALKING

148
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,271
TO STALIN.

149
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,873
>> THEY WERE CALLING HIM

150
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:19,440
UNCLE JOE AT THE TIME.

151
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,708
HE TURNED OUT NOT TO BE A

152
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,776
GREAT GUY.

153
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:23,344
HE KILLED MILLIONS OF

154
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:23,745
PEOPLE.

155
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,445
>> Neil: LEAVING THAT OUT OF

156
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:26,748
THE ARGUMENT HERE.

157
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,549
THE NORTH KOREAN NEEDS

158
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:28,283
SOMETHING OUT OF IT.

159
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:29,284
A LOT MORE THAN WE DO.

160
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:30,385
>> YEAH.

161
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:31,352
>> Neil: WHAT DO WE OFFER IN

162
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:32,153
EXCHANGE THAT DOESN'T LOOK

163
00:03:32,153 --> 00:03:33,655
LIKE WE EVER CAVING AND THAT

164
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:36,624
WAS THE WRAP AGAINST BILL

165
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:37,158
CLINTON.

166
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:38,526
NOT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP.

167
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:39,661
>> WE ARE OFFERING RELIEF.

168
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:40,762
HE LIKES HIS MONEY.

169
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,464
HE WANTS TO BE SEEN AS A

170
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,198
WORLD LEADER.

171
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:44,032
HE LOVES PRESTIGE.

172
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:45,733
IT SEEMS TO ME, EVEN I SAID

173
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:46,835
HE WAS CRAZY BEFORE ON

174
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:47,235
TELEVISION.

175
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:48,369
HE MIGHT NOT BE AS CRAZY AS

176
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:49,204
WE THOUGHT.

177
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:50,605
BUT, YOU KNOW, HE WANTS TO

178
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:54,075
BE WILL HE LEGITIMIZED AND

179
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:55,276
HOPEFULLY THEY SEE WHAT KIND

180
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,679
OF -- LOOK AT THE WEALTH IN

181
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,346
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA COMPARED

182
00:03:58,346 --> 00:03:58,913
TO PYONGYANG.

183
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:00,148
THEY GOT A LOT OF THAT

184
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:01,449
BECAUSE OF CAPITALISM AND

185
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,350
COOPERATING WITH THE WORLD.

186
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,318
THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD

187
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:03,618
STUFF.

188
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,619
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE TRADING

189
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,154
MAINLY WITH CHINA AND SOME

190
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:07,689
WITH SINGAPORE WHICH IS WHY

191
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:08,957
ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY

192
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,325
THE SUMMIT IS GOING TO BE IN

193
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:10,692
SINGAPORE.

194
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:11,726
IF THEY CAN TRADE WITH MORE

195
00:04:11,726 --> 00:04:12,661
PEOPLE AND NOT NECESSARILY

196
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:13,762
UNDER THE THUMB OF THE

197
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:14,462
CHINESE THAT COULD BE IN

198
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,630
THEIR INTEREST.

199
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,765
YOU HAVE GOT TO FIGURE SINCE

200
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:19,668
THE EARLY 1950S PEOPLE BEING

201
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:20,567
LIED TO AND HIS FAMILY ARE

202
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:22,304
GOD AND TAKE A LOT TO BRING

203
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,305
THEM AROUND.

204
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,205
>> Neil: COULD YOU UNIFY THE

205
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:24,472
TWO?

206
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,341
>> HOPEFULLY.

207
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:27,409
>> Neil: THERE WOULD BE NO

208
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:29,044
NORTH OR SOUTH KOREA, THERE

209
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:30,111
WOULD BE ONE KOREA.

210
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:31,313
>> HE PROBABLY DIDN'T

211
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,180
IMAGINE HIS GRANDSON WOULD

212
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,281
BE HOLDING HANDS AND

213
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:35,116
SKIPPING ACROSS THE

214
00:04:35,116 --> 00:04:35,817
DEMILITARIZED ZONE WITH THE

215
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,418
LEADER OF SOUTH KOREA.

216
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:37,752
I MEAN, IT'S VERY

217
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:39,321
INTERESTING TO SAY THE

218
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:39,621
LEAST.

219
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:41,289
AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

220
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:41,623
IT.

221
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:42,157
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

222
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,491
IT IS GOING TO BE PAY PER

223
00:04:43,491 --> 00:00:00,000
VIEW WATCHING.
