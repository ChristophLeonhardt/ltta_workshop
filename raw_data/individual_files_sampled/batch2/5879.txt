we're just talking about the protests out in Sacramento that are going on right now last week in Washington around the country it was the March for our lives there was the women's March last year you go back a couple years there were all those tea party marches those Tea Party protests sometimes it can feel like we are living in an era of protest well guess what there are some numbers out there that back that up rand-new NBC Wall Street Journal survey on activism and protest in America right now how about this for a question we asked folks we said is there something that upsets you right now in America enough to carry a protest sign to go out there and join those crowds look at this 57% of Americans say yeah sign me up I'm ready to go protest there is a partisan split on this it's interesting Democrats and Republicans are both ready to protest Democrats though right now they are more ready 69% of Democrats say ready to hit the streets Republicans still it's a small majority but it's a majority they're at 50% they're saying yes 48% saying no so what is firing them up what's firing up Democrats what's firing up Republicans because they're not going to be protesting for the same reasons well we gave them in this survey a menu of choices could it be this cause or that cause or that cause a whole bunch of options here are the most common answers for each party these are interesting check this out for Republicans they would be ready to protest for protecting borders and limiting immigration that was their top choice also maintaining the right to purchase firearms those are the two top issues that Republicans say would get them out they're protesting for Democrats increasing racial equality and addressing climate change racial equality and climate change according to this survey those are the most animating issues on both sides of the divide right now a couple other things we found in this poll that are interesting we want to point out to you first of all there's this question of this is the story of our times the demographics of this country they are changing they are changing fast that increasing diversity how do the two parties feel about let me just read the wording of this to you because it's a little complicated I want you to understand what we asked them we asked do you agree or not are you comfortable or not with this I feel comfortable with these changes in our society because what makes the country special is taking the very best from people of different experiences and backgrounds in creating a country that thrives in its diversity 74% of Democrats said they agree with that statement 29% of Republicans the statement that Republicans were more likely to agree with is that I feel uneasy with these changes because what makes the country special is our uniquely American experience speaking English in a shared background that brings us all together that was more resonant with Republicans so a big split there and that is sort of I thought we had one after that but we didn't but there you go you get a real sense here that both sides of the aisle right now they are very very animated in this moment for different reasons though some interesting findings there from our new NBC news/wall Street Journal poll hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
