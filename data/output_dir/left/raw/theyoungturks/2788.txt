1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,270
WALMART HAS ANNOUNCED A WAGE
INCREASE FOR ITS EMPLOYEES.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,491
THEY ARE INCREASING THE RATES
FROM $10 AND ALLOW OUR TO

3
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:12,200
$11 AN HOUR AND THEY ARE CITING
TAX REFORM AS THE REASON

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,769
FOR WHY THEY ARE DOING SO.

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:14,769
THERE IS A CATCH.

6
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:17,520
I WILL GET TO THAT IN A MINUTE
BUT FIRST LOOK GET TO THE

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,210
GOOD STUFF.

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:29,680
AMONG THE THINGS THEY'RE GOING
TO IMPLEMENT INCLUDE:

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,590
FOR MATERNITY LEAVE,
THEY'RE OFFERING 10

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,370
WEEKS OF PAID MATERNITY LEAVE
FOR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES IN

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,940
SIX WEEKS OF PATERNITY LEAVE
FOR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES AND

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,530
AGAIN, THIS WILL BE PAID SO THAT
IS GREAT NEWS.

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,829
THEY ARE ALSO OFFERING A
ONE-TIME CASH BONUS FOR ELIGIBLE

14
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,720
ASSOCIATES.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,720
THAT CASH BONUS
WILL DEPEND ON HOW LONG THE

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,829
EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN WITH THE
COMPANY.

17
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:56,760
SO IF THEY'VE BEEN WITH THE
COMMITTEE FOR 20

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,850
YEARS, THEY ARE LIKELY TO GET
MORE.

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:07,680
THAT IS THE LEAST INTERESTING
PART ABOUT IT.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,430
IT'S THE ONE GETTING THE MOST
PRESS BECAUSE IT IS THE

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,710
TRICK THAT WILL ALLOW THESE
COMETH, AT&T, COMCAST,

22
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,970
AMERICAN AIRLINES HAVE BEEN
DOING THAT THE WORSE THEIR

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,650
CUSTOMER SERVICE IS, THE MORE
THEY ARE INCLINED TO DISTRICT.

24
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,900
IT IS A WHO'S WHO OF MISERABLE
CUSTOMER SERVICE.

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,580
WALMART SAYS UP TO $1000.

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,880
IF YOU SERVE 20 YEARS OR MORE.

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,600
IT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE GUY
WHO'S BEEN WORKING WOMAN FOR TWO

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,790
YEARS AS AN GOING TO GET ANY BUT
HE IS NOT GOING TO GET $1000.

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,580
DON'T GET TRICKED BYÃ– OTHER TWO
PARTS I DO REALLY LIKE THAT.

30
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,870
THAT IS A GENERALIST PAID
MATERNITY AND PATERNITY LEAVE.

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:48,049
I WISH IT WAS EQUAL TO ANOTHER
THE IDEAS THAT MEN DON'T DO

32
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,341
THE CHILDCARE AS MUCH AS WOMEN
DO BUT I THINK THAT IS

33
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:53,950
CHANGING AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
EQUALIZE A LITTLE BIT.

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,520
WITH THAT SAID, IT IS IMPORTANT
TO KEEP IN MIND THAT BECAUSE OF

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,130
THE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY AND
FOR THESE CORPORATIONS, WALMART

36
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,330
STANDS TO INCREASE THEIR REVENUE
OR THEIR PROFIT I WOULD SAY BY

37
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,399
$2 BILLION THIS YEAR ALONE.

38
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,630
YES, SOME OF THAT MONEY SHOULD
GO TOWARD ITS EMPLOYEES AND

39
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,170
I'M GLAD THEY ARE DOING THAT
HOWEVER, THERE IS A CATCH.

40
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,620
LET'S GO TO GRAPHIC 63.

41
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:31,650
BY THE WAY, THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
THEY'RE PLANNING ON DOING,

42
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,129
THEY HAVE ALREADY CLOSED
SOME OF THE STORES WITHOUT

43
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:48,459
NOTIFYING 
THE EMPLOYEES.

44
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,489
YOU WILL BE GETTING A BONUS AND
ARRAYS INCREASE IF WE HAVEN'T

45
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:55,319
ALREADY FIRED YOU, SO IT'S
WEIRD HOW THEY LEFT IT ON THE

46
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,180
PRESS RELEASE THE THOUSANDS OF
EMPLOYEES THEY JUST FIRED.

47
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,989
WHAT HAPPENED, ABOUT THE TAX
CUTS WERE SUPPOSED TO

48
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:02,040
CREATE JOBS?

49
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,770
TURNS OUT, NOT SO MUCH.

50
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,019
AS I SAID IN THE PAST ABOUT
THIS ISSUE, I AM NOT IN THE

51
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:10,739
BUSINESS OF TELLING WALMART HOW
TO RUN THEIR BUSINESS.

52
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,830
IF THEY THINK THE SAM'S CLUB'S
ARE NOT MAKING MONEY THAN

53
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,900
THEY AREN'T AND THEY HAVE TO
CLOSES DOWN, BUT DON'T COME

54
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,430
AND PRETEND THE TAX CUTS YOU ARE
GOING TO TAKE HOME TO THE

55
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,591
TUNE OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
MAINLY GOING TO YOUR

56
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:24,980
EXECUTIVES AND SHAREHOLDERS ARE
SOMEHOW FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE

57
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,180
EMPLOYEES THAT YOU FIRED OR THAT
IT IS GOING TO CREATE MORE JOBS.

58
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,770
THAT IS WHAT ALL THOSE BUSINESS
GROUPS SAID AND WE TOLD YOU

59
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,970
AND WE DIDN'T INVESTIGATE AND'S
ON IT AT UNC INVESTIGATE

60
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,970
SHOWED YOU.

61
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,270
KNOW IT IS NOT GOING TO CREATE
JOBS.

62
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,810
BUT THERE IS FAIR, I LOVE THAT
THEY MOVED THE WAGES UP TO $11.

63
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,090
THAT IS ONE OF THE TOP PROBLEMS
ARE NOT THE TOP PROBLEM IN THE

64
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,629
COUNTRIES THAT HER WAGES ARE SO
LOW IT'S RIDICULOUS AND WALMART

65
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,220
IS A GIANT EMPLOYER IN THE
COUNTRY BECAUSE THEIR STORES ARE

66
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,480
HERE, THEY CAN'T OUTSOURCE OR
START STORE IN THE MIDDLE OF

67
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,720
ARKANSAS SO THOSE ARE JOBS AND
THOSE GUYS ADDING PAID $11

68
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,840
RATHER THAN SOME OF THE
PLACES IT WAS $7.25,

69
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,370
WAS THE MINIMUM WAGE NATIONALLY.

70
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,780
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE IN YOUR

71
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,780
LIFE.

72
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,980
WAS IT BECAUSE OF TAX
REFORM?

73
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,500
NOT

74
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,750
THEY WERE GETTING TREMENDOUS
PRESSURE TO MOVE OUT THOSE

75
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,478
WAGES WHICH WAS GREAT.

76
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:21,688
FOR EXAMPLE, TARGET MOVED UP
THEIR WAGES IN THE FALL,

77
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:22,900
BEFORE TAX REFORM.

78
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,099
I'VE SOME DETAILS ON THAT
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS FASCINATING.

79
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:31,130
IN SEPTEMBER 2017 TARGET DID
DECIDE TO INCREASE ITS

80
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,880
WAGES AND THEY PUT OUT A
PRESS RELEASE LIKE MOST

81
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,210
CORPORATIONS WOULD AND THEY
STATED THAT THEY WANT TO BE

82
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,879
COMPETITIVE IN A WAGES SO THEY
CAN ATTRACT MORE EMPLOYEES

83
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,139
AND WHO DO YOU THINK THEIR
COMPETITOR IS?

84
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,229
TAKE NAME STORES LIKE WALMART
AND SO THEY'VE BEEN KIND OF

85
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:53,860
ENGAGING IN A LITTLE BIT OF A
WAGE WAR FOR A WHILE AND SO

86
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,289
LOOK, SAM'S CLUB, WALMART,
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM,

87
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:00,819
THEY ALREADY HAD THEIR WAGES AT
$10 AN HOUR FOR FULL-TIME

88
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:05,749
EMPLOYEES AND YEAH, ADDING ONE
MORE DOLLAR IS GREAT, BUT I

89
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:09,610
DON'T THINK THAT IT NEARLY HAD
TO DO WITH TAX REFORM OR

90
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,610
TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY.

91
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,330
I THINK THEY WERE ALREADY
ENGAGED WITH THIS WAGE WAR

92
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,699
WITH TARGET AND THAT PLAYED INTO
THEIR DECISION TO DO THIS.

93
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,419
I WANT TO GIVE CREDIT TO ALL
THE PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT ON THIS.

94
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:26,300
EVERYONE FROM GUYS ON PICKET
LINES OR JUST PROTESTING TO

95
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,300
GET HIGHER WAGES.

96
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,240
I ALWAYS REMEMBER NICK SMITH
FROM WESTERN VIRGINIA THAT

97
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,690
WE INTERVIEWED DURING THE
ELECTION, WORKED AT A WAFFLE

98
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:38,119
HOUSE LOOKING FOR A $15 MINIMUM
WAGE, TO ROBERT GREENWALD WHO

99
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:40,899
RUNS BRAVE NEW FILMS, ALL THE
PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE, THEY DID

100
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:45,149
THE MOVIE ABOUT WALMART, HIGH
COST OF LOW PRICES THAT BROUGHT

101
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:48,460
SO MUCH ATTENTION TO THIS, THAT
KIND OF PRESSURE WORKS AND

102
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,149
TO PROGRESSIVES LIKE BERNIE
SANDERS WHO KEPT SAYING $15.

103
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:54,919
YOU KNOW THAT OBAMA AND THE
BEGINNING, WAS HERE FROM $15?

104
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,339
HE IS NOT EVEN FOR NOW AS FOR AS
I KNOW DONE THE BEGINNING,

105
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,339
WHAT WAS THE FOUR?

106
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,839
FOR NINE DOLLARS AND THEN HE
RAISED HIS PROPOSAL FROM

107
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,999
NINE DOLLARS TO $10.10

108
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:09,309
AND THEN THE NUMBER WENT TO,
FINALLY WENT TO $12.

109
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:12,960
IF WE HADN'T PUSHED OBAMA, HE
WOULD'VE STATED NINE DOLLARS.

110
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,029
DO YOU THINK WALMART WOULD'VE
GONE TO $11 WHEN OBAMA WHO

111
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:20,119
THEY CALL A SOCIALIST WAS DOWN
AT NINE DOLLARS?

112
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:23,469
KNOW, WE PUSHED AND WE PUSHED
AND WE PUSHED.

113
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:28,619
WE PUSHED FOR $15 SO WE CAN
GET WALMART UP TO $11 THE

114
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:31,990
CORPORATE DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY OF
NO, ASKED FOR A QUARTER OF

115
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,910
A LOAF, ANCHOR KNIT MENTALISM IS
NOT THE CORRECT STRATEGY.

116
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,659
IT'S A LOSING STRATEGY.

117
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,909
INSTEAD WE PUSHED FOR HIGHER
WAGES AND LO AND BEHOLD,

118
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:45,619
EVEN WALMART JUST GAVE US HIGHER
WAGES.

119
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:47,589
IS A HIGH ENOUGH?

120
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:48,589
NOT NEARLY.

121
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:52,229
11 BUCKS AN HOUR FOR A FULL-TIME
JOB GETS YOU ABOUT $22,000

122
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,150
OR SO A YEAR.

123
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,330
THAT IS INCREDIBLY LOW WAGES BUT
AT LEAST WE ARE MAKING SOME

124
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,400
PROGRESS.

125
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,090
SO FOR ALL OF THE BERNIE SANDERS
THAI PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT SO

126
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,580
HARD FOR THIS, AND ALL THE
PROGRESSIVES WHO FOUGHT IN THE

127
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,979
TRENCHES FOR THIS AND FOR THEIR
COMPETITION LIKE TARGET PUSHING

128
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:15,389
THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND
FINALLY, YES, TO WALMART.

129
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,439
BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN THEY DO
SOMETHING RIGHT, GIVE THEM

130
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,610
CREDIT AND SO THEY ARE FIRING
THOSE GUYS ARE SAMS.

131
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,689
IT IS A MIXED BAG BUT THE
MATERNITY AND PATERNITY LEAVE

132
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:27,319
LEAVE IS A GOOD THING AND MOVING
UP TO $11 IS A GOOD THING.

133
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,580
AT LEAST IS HIGHER THAN IT USED
TO BE AND LET'S KEEP ON

134
00:07:30,580 --> 00:00:00,000
PUSHING TO GET TO AT LEAST $15.
