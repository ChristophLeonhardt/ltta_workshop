AND I SAID WOULD YOU DO ME A
FAVOR?
THE REMAINS OF THESE GREAT
FALLEN HEROES, CAN WE DO
SOMETHING?
HE AGREED TO IT IMMEDIATELY.
>> Martha: PRESIDENT FROM
PROVIDING NEW HOPE TO FAMILIES
OF VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN
WAITING FOR MORE THAN 60 YEARS
FOR THEIR LOVED ONES TO BE
RETURNED FROM THE KOREAN WAR.
MORE THAN 7700 AMERICAN TROOPS
ARE STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR.
MY NEXT TWO GUESTS HAVE BEEN
FIGHTING FOR MOST OF THEIR LIVES
FOR THE RETURN OF THEIR FAMILY
MEMBERS.
FIRST LIEUTENANT ROBERT SCHMIDT
PUSHED THROUGH INJURIES TO FIGHT
IN ONE OF THE BLOODIEST BATTLES
OF THE KOREAN WAR AND WAS KILLED
IN ACTION.
JOHN HENRY ZIMMERLI IS AN
AIR FORCE CAPTAIN WHO WENT OUT
ON A MISSION IN KOREA IN 1952 IN
HIS PLANE WITH FOUR OTHERS AND
NEVER RETURNED.
JOAN MORRIS IS THE NIECE OF
FIRST ROBERT SCHMIDT, WHO SHE
KNOWS AS UNCLE BOBBY AND THE SON
OF JOHN HENRY ZIMMERLI.
THANK YOU SO MUCH BOTH OF YOU
FOR BEING WITH US TODAY.
I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A HUGE
PART OF YOUR LIFE, COMMITTED TO
BRINGING HIM HOME.
YOUR UNCLE BOBBY.
WHAT WOULD THIS MEAN TO YOU IF
YOU COULD DO THAT?
>> IT WOULD MEAN CLOSURE FOR OUR
FAMILY, IN PARTICULAR IT WOULD
MEAN THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED THAT
SOMETHING OUR GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS
WANTED US TO DO, AND THAT WAS TO
BRING OUR UNCLE BOBBY HOME TO
NORTH DAKOTA.
SO WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED BY
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND IT WOULD
MEAN THE WORLD TO US TO HAVE HIM
HOME.
>> Martha: THERE WAS A
HEADLINE IN AP AFTER THE SUMMIT,
AND THIS IS WHAT IT RED.
"TRUMP RETREATS FROM U.S. MORAL
LEADERSHIP STANCE."
GIVEN FROM WHERE YOU ARE COMING
FROM IN ALL OF THIS, DO YOU
THINK THAT'S TRUE?
>> YES, I THINK IT'S TRUE, BUT I
THINK IN OUR PARTICULAR CASE,
THIS IS THE FIRST MOTION, THE
FIRST MEETING AND IT'S GETTING
AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF ATTENTION
AND WE EXPECT AN AMAZING AMOUNT
OF ATTENTION FROM IT.
>> Martha: YOU LEARN ABOUT THE
THOUSANDS, THE REMAINS THAT ARE
IN HAWAII SOMEWHERE AND I KNOW
NONE OF YOU KNOW THE WHEREABOUTS
OF THESE REMAINS AND YOU SPENT
SO MUCH OF YOUR LIFETIME WORKING
ON THIS, SO TELL ME ABOUT HOW
YOU FEEL ABOUT IT AND WHETHER OR
NOT, WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT
THE PRESIDENT SAID IN THAT
SOUND BITE AT THE BEGINNING.
>> WE ARE AMAZED.
THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND
PRESIDENT IN HISTORY THAT HAS
EVER GIVEN OUR CASE ANY
ATTENTION AT ALL.
WE ARE ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED.
WE THINK IT'S THE FIRST STEP IN
MAKING A LOT OF HEADWAY TOWARDS
FINDING INFORMATION ABOUT OUR
LOVED ONES.
THE REMAINS THAT THEY WANT TO
BRING BACK TO US WILL IDENTIFY A
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND SOME
OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD HAVE
MAYBE NOT KNOWN TO BE KILLED IN
ACTION.
THEY WOULD JUST BE M.I.A. LIKE
MY FATHER'S CASE, WE ARE SIMPLY
MISSING HIM, WE DON'T KNOW IF HE
DIED IN A BATTLE FIELD, IF HE
WAS A P.O.W. OR JUST WHAT
HAPPENED.
SO BY DOING DNA ANALYSIS ON ALL
THESE REMAINS WE WILL BE ABLE TO
UNCOVER GOOD INFORMATION ON A
NUMBER OF THESE CASES.
FOR INSTANCE, IF MY FATHER, IF
ANY OF MY FATHER SCREW WANT TO
BE IDENTIFIED THEN WE WOULD
ASSUME THE PLANE TO CRASH AND
PROBABLY ALL OF THEM DIED.
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED.
>> Martha: IT MUST BE SO HARD
LIVING WITH THAT, JOHN.
ALL THESE YEARS.
>> IT CERTAINLY IS.
AS A YOUNG PERSON FOUR AND FIVE
YEARS OLD, THE MILITARY TOLD MY
FAMILY, MYSELF AND MY MOTHER
THAT IF THEY FOUND ANYTHING,
THEY WOULD CONTINUE LOOKING FOR
IT, IF THEY FIND ANYTHING AT ALL
THAT WOULD NOTIFY US
IMMEDIATELY.
I WAS THE PERSON IN THE FAMILY
THAT WENT TO THE MAILBOX EVERY
DAY LOOKING FOR THAT INFORMATION
DAY LOOKING FOR THAT INFORMATIO
INFORMATION.
AND NEVER RECEIVED IT.
IN 1995 THEY SENT ME A POSTCARD
SAYING THAT THEY ARE WILLING NOW
TO LOOK INTO THESE CASES AND SO
I FLEW UP TO D.C. TO MEET WITH
THE NEW DEPARTMENT AND I WAS NOT
EXACTLY PLEASED WITH WHAT THEY
INTENDED TO DO SO I STARTED
DOING MY OWN RESEARCH IN 1995.
>> Martha: I KNOW IT'S BEEN
EXTENSIVE.
JOAN, IN TERMS OF YOUR REACTION
TO WHAT YOU SAW PLAY OUT IN THIS
SUMMIT THAT WE WATCHED OVER THE
LAST 48 HOURS, WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR MIND EVEN YOUR
FAMILY'S OWN CONNECTION TO THIS
WAR?
I'M SORRY, THAT WAS FOR JOAN.
>> WE WERE JUST SO GRATEFUL THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK THE TIME
DURING THE SUMMIT TO ADDRESS THE
FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY
MISSING SOLDIERS FROM THE KOREAN
WAR.
IT WAS VERY HEARTWARMING TO SEE
THAT THERE WAS CAIR THERE
FORGETTING OUR SOLDIERS BACK
HOME.
>> Martha: THEY TOLD      CALLED
>> Martha: THEY TOLD      CALLET
>> Martha: THEY TOLD      CALLEE
FORGOTTEN WAR, AND IT IS NOT
FORGOTTEN AND YOUR FAMILIES AND
YOU CARRY THE MEMORIES OF THESE
INDIVIDUALS AND YOU LOOK AT THE
PICTURES THAT WE JUST DID, FULL
OF SPIRIT AND FULL OF LIFE.
THESE YOUNG MEN WHO LOST THEIR
LIVES.
WE WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW YOUR
STORY AND WE WOULD LOVE YOU TO
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH US AND LET US
KNOW IF YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH
THE FOLLOW-THROUGH HERE, BECAUSE
IF YOU ARE NOT WE WANT TO KNOW
