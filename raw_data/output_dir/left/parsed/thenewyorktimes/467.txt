You know I don't want to come.
I didn't want to come back,
but when I heard about
the conveyor belt of death
that the politicians were
trying to set in motion.
I guess I knew that I wouldn't
be able to live with myself
if I didn't come back and try
to do something.
You know, if I were to
just sit around
and let these
people be killed.
I would have to think about
that for the rest of my life.
Thank you, guys,
you know.
I felt the need to
come down here.
I don't know any of the
individuals personally,
but I know what they're going
through of course because I
spent time on H-Unit death row,
down in McAlester, Oklahoma.
and I was actually there for
12 and a half years,
16 and a half
overall.
And you also have a
personal plea from
an exonerated death row inmate
that was put on death row at
the age of 19 and spent 16
and a half years for a crime
I did not commit. I plead for
empathy for those seven souls.
OK. Thank you.
You're welcome.
And your name?
My name is
Paris L. Powell.
Hi, Paris.
I came to this state just for
this reason, to ask for empathy.
Is the governor considering
granting clemency?
The governor is continuing
to review the clemency
application, he hasn't
made any decisions yet.
Do you know when
he'll make a decision?
I do not.
