America is a very different kind of country in fact it's unique and even after tragedies such as the recent one we must remember just how special this nation is and how it was born already we are hearing calls from the left for new laws banning this gun banning that gun confiscation all of them miss the absolute truth of these kinds of events and all misuse of weapons guns are misused by three types of people usually first common criminals the bank robber or the mugger there is no law that will stop them because they're already breaking of the law secondly there are terrorists likewise they don't care what laws you bring they will access weapons illegally and if they don't access weapons they'll create them look what happened in the UK look what happened in Germany vehicles being used to kill scores of people in one attack or look at Boston a pressure cooker created turned into an improvised explosive device the last category are the mentally unstable it is already illegal for somebody such as the recent killer to acquire a weapon if you have psychiatric problems however current laws are not being properly implemented and in many cases the consequences of the left-wing decisions of the 1970s it makes adjudicating an American citizen mentally incompetent almost impossible and likewise it very very difficult to institutionalize somebody against their will means that these kinds of tragedies will happen again and again and again until we take mental health seriously but what has this got to do with the nature of America everything we have a second amendment and I'm going to repeat it because it has to be repeated in the face of the cause we are hearing today the Second Amendment to the US Constitution has nothing to do with hunting whitetails it has nothing to do with personal protection from criminal violence it exists because of dictatorship it exists because of unrepresentative government whether it's King George two plus centuries ago or whether it's a modern dictator a fascist or a communist because America is the only nation that was born of an idea it wasn't created because of some dynasty some ethnic group or happenstance of geography it was birthed based upon the idea of liberty and freedom and a representative Republic the founding fathers understood that the last guarantee for any kind of government that wishes to take your rights away is the use of force but citizens against that regime it is no accident that the deadliest dictators in history be it Hitler made Stalin biet Mao the first thing they did was to disarm their populace why because a disarmed populace is not made up of citizens it is made up of subjects of prisoners America is the greatest nation on God's earth in part because it was created on the basis of individual liberty and freedom inanimate objects aren't evil men and women can use inanimate objects to do evil but guns are your last protection against those who wish to take your rights away from you America it's special for a reason thank you for watching the Gawker briefing if you like this video please check out the rebel media YouTube channel follow me on Twitter at Seb Gorka that's Seb ji o RK a and share these videos on Facebook and Twitter because with your help we can push back on the fake news industrial complex and finally get the truth out god bless
