1
00:00:00,854 --> 00:00:02,923
WE NEED THE DOCUMENTS RELEASED.

2
00:00:02,923 --> 00:00:04,991
THEY'RE DEMANDING TO SEE IT.

3
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:06,793
A LOT TO COVER.

4
00:00:06,793 --> 00:00:09,863
TONIGHT'S BREAKING NEWS OPENING

5
00:00:09,863 --> 00:00:10,230
MONOLOGUE.

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,798
WE START WITH ANOTHER STINGING

7
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:14,801
SETBACK FOR THE SPECIAL COUNSEL,

8
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:16,103
ROBERT MUELLER.

9
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:18,138
RUDY GULIANI IS SAYING TONIGHT

10
00:00:18,138 --> 00:00:19,005
THAT ROBERT MUELLER WILL NOT

11
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:20,874
SEEK A PRESIDENTIAL INDICT.

12
00:00:20,874 --> 00:00:23,076
IT'S OBVIOUS WHY MUELLER WON'T

13
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:24,845
EVEN TRY BECAUSE AS WE HAVE BEEN

14
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:27,380
TELLING YOU, HE NEVER HAD A

15
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,615
LEGAL LEG TO STAND ON.

16
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:30,617
DOJ GUIDELINES CLEARLY STATE

17
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:32,319
THAT A SITTING PRESIDENT CANNOT

18
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:33,253
BE INDICTED.

19
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:34,788
NOT TO MENTION MUELLER DOESN'T

20
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:36,389
HAVE A REASON TO DO SO IN THE

21
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:37,390
FIRST PLACE.

22
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,860
MUELLER HAS ZERO EVIDENCE OF

23
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,161
COLLUSION, HAS ONLY BEEN FOCUSED

24
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:44,331
ON THE VAULT CRIMES OF THE

25
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:46,266
PRESIDENT AND IT'S NOT A CRIME

26
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:47,134
TO HAVE THOUGHTS.

27
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,301
RUDY GULIANI REACTING TO

28
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,970
TOMORROW BEING THE ONE-YEAR

29
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,373
ANNIVERSARY OF MUELLER'S CORRUPT

30
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:53,807
INVESTIGATION.

31
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:57,010
HERE'S PART OF THE INTERVIEW

32
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,445
THAT WILL AIR WITH LAURA.

33
00:00:58,445 --> 00:00:59,913
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

34
00:00:59,913 --> 00:01:01,581
>> WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR THIS

35
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:02,048
TO WRAP UP?

36
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:03,884
>> THEY SHOULD DO IT TODAY.

37
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:04,851
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

38
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:06,987
THAT I HAVE THE FACTS TO WRITE

39
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:07,954
THEIR REPORT.

40
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:09,456
YOU CAN WRITE A FAIR REPORT,

41
00:01:09,456 --> 00:01:10,757
FINE.

42
00:01:10,757 --> 00:01:12,492
IF YOU CAN WRITE AN UNFAIR

43
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:13,894
REPORT, WRITE IT AROUND WE'LL

44
00:01:13,894 --> 00:01:14,828
COMBAT IT.

45
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:16,163
WE'RE READY.

46
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:17,831
>> THE FORMER NEW YORK CITY

47
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:19,132
MAYOR IS RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

48
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:20,800
HE TOLD LAURA INGRAHAM ABOUT THE

49
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,569
DAMAGE THAT THIS INVESTIGATION

50
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:24,437
IS DOING TO THIS COUNTRY.

51
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:26,306
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.

52
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:28,675
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FLASH

53
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:29,843
POINTS, THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING,

54
00:01:29,843 --> 00:01:32,445
THE STORMY DANIELS PAYMENT, THE

55
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:37,450
RAID ON MANAFORT, THE RAIN ON

56
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,585
COHEN, IS THERE ONE PART OF THAT

57
00:01:38,585 --> 00:01:40,387
THAT CONCERNS THE OTHER PARTS?

58
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:41,988
>> YEAH, THEIR INABILITY TO

59
00:01:41,988 --> 00:01:43,623
REACH A CONCLUSION THAT IS

60
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:46,393
OBVIOUS AND INWILLINGNESS TO

61
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:47,294
RECOGNIZE THE DAMAGE THIS DOES

62
00:01:47,294 --> 00:01:48,195
TO OUR COUNTRY.

63
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:50,630
THIS WAS ENGINEERED BY COMEY.

64
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,767
>> Sean: WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS

65
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:56,503
WITH JOE AND LAURA'S FILL

66
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:58,505
INTERVIEW WITH RUDY THAT AIRS

67
00:01:58,505 --> 00:01:59,506
AFTER THIS PROGRAM.

68
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:01,474
ON THE FOREIGN POLICY FRONT,

69
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:02,842
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT BLINKING

70
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:04,077
IN THE STANDOFF WITH KIM JONG-UN

71
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:05,245
AND NORTH KOREA.

72
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:07,914
REMEMBER, KIM JONG-UN IS NOW

73
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:10,650
TRYING TO ACT TOUGH AS HE EGO

74
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,553
HAS BEEN BRUISED.

75
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:16,489
HE'S THREATENING TO WITHDRAW

76
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:18,258
FROM THE SUMMIT.

77
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:20,327
HE SAID DENUCLEARIZATION IS NOT

78
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:22,195
ON THE TABLE.

79
00:02:22,195 --> 00:02:23,396
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HIS PEACE

80
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:26,233
THROUGH STRENGTH POLICY

81
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:26,633
CONTINUES.

82
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,702
TAKE A LOOK.

83
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:32,672
>> WE'LL HAVE TO SAY.

84
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:34,207
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING.

85
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:36,009
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.

86
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:38,878
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

87
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:40,547
WHATEVER IT IS --

88
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:41,815
>> Sean: OBVIOUSLY THE LIBERAL

89
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:43,750
MEDIA IN A FRENZY OVER THIS

90
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,150
DEVELOPMENT.

91
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,186
THINK ABOUT IT, FOR THEM TO

92
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:47,287
SUCCEED AND THE PRESIDENT TO

93
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:47,587
FAIL.

94
00:02:47,587 --> 00:02:49,656
FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO SUCCEED IS

95
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:51,024
THE PRESIDENT TO FAIL.

96
00:02:51,024 --> 00:02:53,693
THE PRESIDENT IS STANDING FIRM

97
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:56,463
ON DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

98
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:57,397
KOREAN PENINSULA.

99
00:02:57,397 --> 00:02:59,532
JOHN BOLTON SAYS THIS IS PART OF

100
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:01,301
THE GAME THAT NORTH KOREA ALWAYS

101
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,035
PLAYS.

102
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:05,572
UNLIKE CLINTON, WE'RE NOT TRYING

103
00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:07,340
TO BRIBE THE GUY.

104
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,143
>> THE QUESTION IS IF THIS IS

105
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:11,745
REALLY A SIGN THIS THEY'RE NOT

106
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:14,981
TAKING DENUCLEARIZATION

107
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:15,582
SERIOUSLY.

108
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:17,417
KIM JONG-UN TOLD SOUTH KOREAN

109
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,386
PRESIDENT AT THE APRIL 27 SUMMIT

110
00:03:19,386 --> 00:03:22,322
THAT HE AGREED TO

111
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:22,822
DENUCLEARIZATION.

112
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:24,891
SO IF THEY'RE WALKING BACK FROM

113
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:26,626
IT, WE'LL FIND OUT.

114
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:28,395
SARAH SANDERS SAID THIS MORNING

115
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:29,663
PRETTY MUCH WHAT THE PRESIDENT

116
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:30,397
IS THINKING.

117
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:31,931
IF THEY'RE READY TO MEET, WE'RE

118
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:32,932
READY TO MEET.

119
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:34,934
IF THEY'RE NOT READY, THEN WE

120
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:36,036
WON'T MEET.

121
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:39,439
>> Sean: WE HAVE THE THREE

122
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,440
HOSTAGES BACK.

123
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,009
HE'S NOT FIRING MISSILES, SO FAR

124
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:44,577
A WIN.

125
00:03:44,577 --> 00:03:47,981
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE, TRUST

126
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:49,516
BUT VERIFY.

127
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,451
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT GIVING UP

128
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:51,818
ANYTHING.

129
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:52,952
KIM JONG-UN HAS MADE EVERY

130
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:54,654
CONCESSION, HE GAVE UP THE

131
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:55,021
HOSTAGES.

132
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:56,956
WE DON'T HAVE TO APPEASE HIM

133
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:58,758
WITH A PLANE LOAD OF CASH AND

134
00:03:58,758 --> 00:04:00,994
CURRENCIES AND $150 BILLION LIKE

135
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:02,028
OBAMA DID WITH IRAN.

136
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:03,463
SO THE BALL IS IN KIM JONG-UN'S

137
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:03,763
COURT.

138
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:05,632
HE WANTS TO TALK, HE WANTS A

139
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:08,134
DEAL, HE WANTS A BETTER LIFE FOR

140
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:09,903
HIS PEOPLE, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

141
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:10,937
READY TO LISTEN.

142
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:12,539
NORTH KOREA WON'T BE ALLOWED TO

143
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:13,873
BUILD NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

144
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:15,308
THAT'S A FACT.

145
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:15,608
THE.

146
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,476
HAS MADE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR.

147
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:19,112
WE'RE GETTING CLARITY ON ANOTHER

148
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:19,879
MAJOR STORY.

149
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,180
REMEMBER HOW THE PAST YEAR THE

150
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,718
LEFT WING MEDIA, THE DEMOCRATS

151
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:26,720
PROMISING THAT TRUMP TOWER

152
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,522
MEETING WAS SOMEHOW THE BIG

153
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:31,491
SMOKING GUN OF RUSSIA COLLUSION?

154
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:32,992
TONIGHT IN SPEED OF MEDIA

155
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:34,327
REPORTS, WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE

156
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:35,962
THAT IT WAS A TOTAL DUD.

157
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:37,864
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

158
00:04:37,864 --> 00:04:39,366
RELEASED THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF

159
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:39,733
TESTIMONY.

160
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:41,601
SEVERAL KEY PLAYERS AT THE

161
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:41,935
MEETING.

162
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:43,403
THE MAKE TAKE-AWAY IS THIS.

163
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:45,105
THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS A WASTE

164
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:46,106
OF THEIR TIME.

165
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:50,543
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT

166
00:04:50,543 --> 00:04:50,910
ADOPTION.

167
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,545
NO DIRT ON HILLARY CLINTON CAME

168
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:52,879
THROUGH.

169
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,514
IF IT DID, IT WOULDN'T BE

170
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:54,948
ILLEGAL.

171
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:56,116
WE'LL EXPLAIN THAT TONIGHT.

172
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:57,917
FROM ALL ACCOUNTS, THIS MEETING

173
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:00,086
WENT OFF THE RAILS AND FOCUSSED

174
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:01,621
IN ON TOPICS LIKE RUSSIAN

175
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:03,089
ADOPTION AND RUSSIAN ADOPTION.

176
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:04,524
IT'S A NOTHING BURGER.

177
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:06,426
THE MEDIA HAVE BEEN HYPING THIS

178
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:08,928
AS A CRUISE MISSILE THAT WAS

179
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:10,663
GOING TO TAKE DOWN THE TRUMP

180
00:05:10,663 --> 00:05:11,197
ADMINISTRATION.

181
00:05:11,197 --> 00:05:12,532
DONALD TRUMP JR., HE TESTIFIED.

182
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:14,367
HE WAS SKEPTICAL GOING INTO THE

183
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,736
MEETING AND THAT HIS SUSPICIONS

184
00:05:16,736 --> 00:05:19,072
WERE QUICKLY JUSTIFIED.

185
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:20,540
DONALD TRUMP JR. ALSO SAID THAT

186
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,142
HIS FATHER, PRESIDENT TRUMP, HAD

187
00:05:22,142 --> 00:05:24,744
NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH IT IN

188
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:26,846
ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.

189
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:29,082
DESPITE ALL OF THIS WILD AND

190
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:31,151
FALSE SPECULATION, IT'S NOTHING.

191
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:32,652
THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING IS NOT

192
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:34,154
THE ONLY BREAKING NEWS STORY

193
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:37,424
THAT IS EMBARRASSING TO THE

194
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:39,926
DESTROY TRUMP MEDIA.

195
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:40,760
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," THEY HATE

196
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,294
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

197
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:43,696
THEY'RE NOW BASICALLY TONIGHT

198
00:05:43,696 --> 00:05:44,898
CONFIRMING EVERYTHING WE HAVE

199
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:49,068
BEEN TELLING YOU REGARDING THE

200
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:51,671
HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY.

201
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:58,912
IT'S NOT A MAYA CULPA, IT'S

202
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:00,947
PROBABLY INADVERTENT.

203
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:03,516
THIS WAS THEIR ORIGINAL HEADLINE

204
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:03,817
TODAY.

205
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:05,718
A SECRET MISSION, A CODE NAME

206
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:07,587
AND ANXIETY INSIDE THE EARLY

207
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:10,457
DAYS OF THE FBI'S TRUMP

208
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:10,890
INVESTIGATION.

209
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,926
THEY CHANGED THE HEADLINE.

210
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:14,461
CODE NAME CROSSFIRE HURRICANE.

211
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:17,363
THE SECRET ORIGINS OF THE TRUMP

212
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:17,897
ADMINISTRATION.

213
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:20,033
GREAT TO KNOW SOMEBODY IN THE

214
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:22,035
FBI LIKE THE ROLLING STONES.

215
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:23,369
WHY WOULD THEY CHANGE IT?

216
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:24,404
LET ME EXPLAIN.

217
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:25,738
IT'S A LONG ARTICLE.

218
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:29,742
THE TIMES EXPLAINS HOW THE FBI

219
00:06:29,742 --> 00:06:32,512
OPENED A TOP SECRET OPERATION

220
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:33,680
INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

221
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,216
BY THE WAY, ONLY DAYS AFTER THEY

222
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:37,817
RIGGED THE INVESTIGATION INTO

223
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:39,352
HILLARY AND THE SAME EXACT

224
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:40,053
PLAYERS.

225
00:06:40,053 --> 00:06:41,955
NOW, THE DETAILS WERE CLOSELY

226
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:44,290
GUARDED BY FBI OFFICIALS.

227
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,926
THIS ALL HAPPENED DAYS JUST DAYS

228
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:49,896
AFTER THE SAME PEOPLE PUT THE

229
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:52,699
FIX IN WITH THE EXONERATION OF

230
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:57,437
HILLARY CLINTON, RIGGING IT

231
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,906
AND OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

232
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:01,140
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN EXPOSING.

233
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,843
TO BREAK IT DOWN THIS WAY, IN

234
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:13,386
THE SUMMER OF 2016, THEY

235
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:15,722
INTERVIEWED ALEXANDER DOWNER.

236
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:17,891
HE'S THE GUY THAT GOT DRUNK ONE

237
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:19,792
NIGHT WITH SOME GUY.

238
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:21,127
I THOUGHT I KNEW EVERYBODY IN

239
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:22,428
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

240
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:23,463
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS.

241
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:25,265
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

242
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:28,234
THE TRUMP ADVISER THAT HEARD OF.

243
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:31,437
WHILE DRINKING, THEY GOSSIPED

244
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:33,006
LIKE MEAN GIRLS AND DIRT ON

245
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:33,873
HILLARY CLINTON.

246
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:35,842
DOWNER ALERTED THE AUSTRALIAN

247
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:37,810
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY THAT TOLD

248
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,613
THEIR U.S. COUNTER PARTS.

249
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:41,447
FOUR-WAY HEARSAY.

250
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:42,482
THIS IS MASSIVE.

251
00:07:42,482 --> 00:07:44,751
THE TIMES IS CONFIRMING THAT THE

252
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:47,387
FBI USED FOUR-WAY HEARSAY TO

253
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:48,521
LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION LIKE

254
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:50,857
WE'VE BEEN TELLING YOU ON THE

255
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:51,190
PROGRAM.

256
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,092
THEIR TIMELINE DOESN'T MATCH UP

257
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:55,461
AND HEARSAY IS NEVER ADMISSIBLE

258
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:56,896
NEVER MIND FOUR-WAY HEARSAY IN A

259
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:57,997
COURT OF LAW.

260
00:07:57,997 --> 00:07:59,465
SO WHAT "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS

261
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:01,501
PROVING IS WE'VE BEEN RIGHT THE

262
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:02,969
ENTIRE TIME AND IN THE PROCESS

263
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:04,704
OF TRYING TO COVER UP FOR THEIR

264
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:06,906
DEEP STATE FRIENDS AND MAKING

265
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:07,874
EXCUSES, THEY'RE EXPOSING THEM.

266
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:09,442
THE TIMES AND THE REST OF THE

267
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:10,743
MEDIA HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET

268
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:12,812
AHEAD OF WHAT IS A MASSIVE

269
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:15,648
SCANDAL AND PROTECT THE LIKES OF

270
00:08:15,648 --> 00:08:16,883
COMEY AND SOMEBODY CAKE AND

271
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:18,751
STRZOK AND LYNCH AND PAGE AND

272
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:19,319
EVERYONE ELSE.

273
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,620
BUT THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THE

274
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,121
FACTS, THE EVIDENCE, THE TRUTH

275
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,556

00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:25,658
WE HAVE BEEN PROMISING YOU THIS.

277
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:27,026
SO FAR WHAT WE'VE BEEN

278
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:28,394
UNCOVERING IS ONLY THE

279
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:28,761
BEGINNING.

280
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:30,697
THIS IS GOING TO GET WORSE FOR

281
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:32,365
ALL OF THESE DEEP STATE ACTORS

282
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:33,433
BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.

283
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:37,035
TAKE A LOOK AT THE SIDE OF YOUR

284
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:37,804
SCREEN.

285
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:39,772
JAMES COMEY, ANDREW McCABE,

286
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:41,407
LORETTA LYNCH, PETER STRZOK,

287
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:44,010
LISA PAGE, ALL AT THE CENTER OF

288
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,745
THIS SCANDAL.

289
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:49,649
COMEY IS A LIAR AND LEAKER.

290
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:53,953
McCABE LIED UNDER OATH MULTIPLE

291
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:54,253
TIMES.

292
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:54,988
LORETTA LYNCH TRIED TO

293
00:08:54,988 --> 00:08:56,756
COMPROMISE THE CLINTON E-MAIL

294
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:57,957
INVESTIGATION AND COMEY TO SAY

00:08:57,957 --> 00:08:59,225
IT'S NOTICE AN INVESTIGATION.

296
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:00,259
IT'S ONLY A MATTER.

297
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:03,796
THEN YOU HAVE THE FBI ANTI-TRUMP

298
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:05,531
LOVEBIRDS, STRZOK AND PAGE.

299
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:07,533
THEY ABUSED THE PRESIDENT

300
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:09,168
VERBALLY, ATTACKING HIM IN

301
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:09,469
TEXTS.

302
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:11,838
AND STRZOK'S FINGERPRINTS ARE

303
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:13,139
ALL OVER EVERYTHING.

304
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,440
MORE ON THAT IN A SECOND.

305
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,808
ANOTHER BIG STORY FIRST TO TELL

306
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:16,542
YOU ABOUT.

307
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:19,178
THE DOJ'S ATTEMPT TO SLOW WALK,

308
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:20,513
STONE WALL, OBSTRUCT CONGRESS

309
00:09:20,513 --> 00:09:23,182
FROM EVER SEEING OVER 1.2

310
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:24,517
MILLION DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE

311
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:26,953
CLINTON E-MAIL SERVER

312
00:09:26,953 --> 00:09:27,754
INVESTIGATION AND THE RUSSIA

313
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:30,189
WITCH HUNT, WHICH SHOULD BE

314
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:32,425
COMING TO AN END.

315
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:34,227
THEY'RE NOW ASKING THE PRESIDENT

316
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:36,663
TO USE HIS EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY

317
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:37,797
AND INSTRUCT THE ATTORNEY

318
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:39,332
GENERAL, JEFF SESSIONS WHO

319
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,834
SHOULD BE DOING IT ON HIS OWN TO

320
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:42,869
IMMEDIATELY TURN OVER ALL

321
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:45,104
DOCUMENTS THAT CONGRESS HAS

322
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:46,606
SUBPOENAED AND HAS A

323
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:47,940
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT CO-EQUAL

324
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,410
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND A

325
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,411
RIGHT TO OVERSIGHT AND

326
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:52,779
SEPARATION OF POWERS.

327
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:53,613
IT'S UNSANE.

328
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:55,581
IT'S UNFAIR TO YOU, THE AMERICAN

329
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:58,317
PEOPLE, THAT IT HAS COME TO THIS

330
00:09:58,317 --> 00:09:59,786
AS CONGRESS HAS THE

331
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:00,887
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY AS PART

332
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:02,855
OF THEIR CHECKS AND BALANCES.

333
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:05,825
ROD ROSENSTEIN, HE'S BEEN

334
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:07,260
CONCEALING INFORMATION AND THEN

335
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,761
NEEDLESSLY REDACTING KEY PARTS

336
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:11,764
OF THESE THINGS IN THE NAME OF

337
00:10:11,764 --> 00:10:13,166
NATIONAL SECURITY THAT GETS

338
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,300
PROVEN LATER NOT TO HAVE

339
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,935
ANYTHING TO DO WITH NATIONAL

340
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,436
SECURITY.

341
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:17,804
ROSENSTEIN CLAIMS THAT, BUT IT'S

342
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:18,771
NOT TRUE.

343
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:20,373
WE'VE SEEN THIS LIE PLAY OUT.

344
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:22,742
IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING ALL OF HIS

345
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:23,543
FRIENDS.

346
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:24,777
MEANWHILE, HE'S CONFLICTED FROM

347
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:26,279
THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS.

348
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,981
BY THE WAY, WAS A NO-SHOW FOR A

349
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:29,949
CLOSED DOOR HEARING WITH THE

350
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:31,417
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

351
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:31,818
TODAY.

352
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:33,019
I WONDER WHY.

353
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:34,520
SEVERAL OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

354
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,723
OFFICIALS, THEY WERE QUOTED BUT

355
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:37,657
COMEY DODGED THE ENTIRE THING.

356
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:38,624
THAT'S TELLING.

357
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:40,226
THINK ABOUT THIS.

358
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:43,429
CONGRESSMAN JORDAN AND DESANTIS

359
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:44,864
WILL JOIN US IN A MINUTE, A

360
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:46,733
MAJOR FOLLOW UP ON THE FORMER

361
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,935
OBAMA OFFICIAL THAT AT ONE POINT

362
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:52,672
VOTED FOR THE COMMUNIST FOR

363
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:53,039
PRESIDENT.

364
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,042
HOW HE BECAME A CIA DIRECTOR IS

365
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:56,476
BREATHTAKING.

366
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:58,511
JONATHAN BRENNAN.

367
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:05,318
PAUL SPERRY REPORTEDLY

368
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:07,019
THREATENED THE PRESIDENT AND IS

369
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,821
NOW BEING EXPOSED BY A LIAR.

370
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:11,758
LAST MAY THE FORMER CIA DIRECTOR

371
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,693
TESTIFIED UNDER OATH THAT THE

372
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:15,862
DOSSIER DIDN'T FACTOR INTO THE

373
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:17,296
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY'S

374
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:18,965
ASSESSMENT OF RUSSIA ELECTION

375
00:11:18,965 --> 00:11:19,332
MEDDLING.

376
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:20,566
