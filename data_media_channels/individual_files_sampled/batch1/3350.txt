I am joined today by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella who has a notebook new book titled hit refresh Satya thank you for joining us thank you for having me of course so you are the third CEO in Microsoft's 40 year history what advice did Steve amar Bill Gates have for you when you took over Ravana the best pieces of advice I have ever gotten was from Steve which was be bold be right and it is a great metaphor because he said look if you're not balding aren't gonna do anything big and if you're not right you're not gonna be alive so therefore so in some sense be bold be right and I think it captures the essence of leadership how did you change that and how do you manage company one of the things I write about in the book is when you're successful as an organization what happens is you get this virtuous cycle between the product on the concept that's a hit the capability you have as an organization and your culture right really all three of them are in this beautiful virtuous LOC but then you know what happens with any great success you you know it tapers off you need a new concept you need a new growth factor that needs new capability and that's where culture becomes important because you can't be beholden to your past but your culture needs to let go of the past and invent new things and for us at Microsoft we quite frankly have gotten it more right than wrong I mean there's no way we would be sitting here 43 years into our existence competing with a whole set of new people who were not there when we work started if we had not done that it was recapturing that having grown up inside the company for 25 years I've observed where when are the times we have gotten it right when were will be able to break free of our past habits so that we can invent new things and that's what we really try to do take the you know I joined Microsoft in 1992 when we were just beginning Windows NT what ultimately became even our server business and client-server participation and you can trace it straight line to our cloud but when I joined the company most people thought that if there was no way Microsoft a PC company can ever build a server or succeed in the server business but we persisted we changed we in fact brought lots of new people including people like me into the company we grew new capability we went after this new market called the data center and change the rules so to me that was a great way to learn what we are capable of in terms of really building both a new culture a new capability and a new concept I mean one of the things that I've definitely come to realize as a CEO is what a multi constituent job it is in other words it's not just about customers or partners or shareholders or employees or governments it's about all of them all the time and so that thing about trying to say well let's compartmentalize it and let's try and plan and schedule each one or to high precision it's probably not going to work because it's dynamic so that's where I think what matters at least what I'm learning matters is judgment and there's a temporal nature to it right now I'm on the road I'm spending time with some customers in media and obviously you know in the coming weeks I'll probably spend more time on the products in engineering and the ability to figure out how to balance things out so that you are in touch with the multi to constitute world is what I think I see or pretty much any leader in today's fast-changing world has to do when you were here in your wife to come to America you had a green card and you were encouraged to actually go back to an h-1b visa to bring it to the country can you talk a little bit about that and one of the things that I always say is I'm a product of two amazing American things which is both American technology reaching me where I was growing up and the enlightened I'm an immigration policy that allowed me to not only the dream the dream but live the dream after coming here and in the context of the immigration policy it turns out that if you have a green card it's harder for your spouse to join you whereas it's not with h-1b so it is a very straightforward trade-off for me I got good advice from at that time an immigration lawyer and Microsoft that's what I write in the book but the broader question for me is in the immigration policy of this country is our competitive advantage we are able to attract people from all over the world to come contribute to our economy and to our companies but we also are the beacon of hope for those who needed the most so I think that America is exceptional in what we have created here and it's something that we should preserve again I go back and say you know before we talk about any change to our immigration policy we should recognize that it is already one of the biggest competitive strengths we have where else would a story like mine be possible nowhere else so let's start there so I'm actually both thankful for the immigration policy and also recognize the exceptional you know policy that we have is it does it have issues of course daca is a clear example of it we have been very clear I think there's we should show our humanity people who are you know on daca here are great participants in our economy in fact Microsoft as many of them they are you know doing a great job in contributing to our economy and we should make sure that we treat that with care talk about immigration without mentioning the president you agreed to serve on his Advisory Council here's first elected what to you are Microsoft get from being on the Advisory Council with the President and do you think he listens to what you saying I've had the chance to meet President Trump twice once before he was sworn in and once in the White House in both times with many of my other industry colleagues and we had conversations about immigration about infrastructure the need for the government to invest in digital technology so that the taxpayer money is well spent and these are conversations that we've had with even previous administrations and mirror the same in the in fact the conversations I have with heads of state all over are very similar so I think engaging and making sure that we are able to bring technology which is what we have expertise in to bear on some of the pressing societal and public sector challenges is an important piece and at the same time we'll take principled stance like we have done on daca or on immigration or like we did even with the previous administration around secure national security and the need for privacy these are all places where I think we will be guided by the enduring values and principles with any administration I think it is important for companies like ours to have a set of principle that governs some of the most important things like privacy and security and our immigration and take a stance ultimately we also should recognize that they are not the elected officials we don't have some mandate from the people of this country and so therefore both the legislative process and the framework of laws that come out should govern us all but when there isn't that structure in place it is up to us as companies and leaders to take principled stance what would you recommend the privacy and data loss of that number means can get what they need but people feel safe and secure I think the real burden here is to make sure that there is due process and there's transparency all around the first and foremost we want to protect the privacy of the individual and that like in the past with new medium like the Telegraph and they had to deal with wire fraud they came up with a set of laws that allowed them us to really go after wire fraud without sacrificing the Telegraph I think similarly we will have to look at what are the mechanisms that governments have what is the transparency around that so that there is a set of due process that can be followed especially in with courts so that people's privacy is protected because that's paramount do you think I think in like all places there is a certain amount of education that is required with any new technology this is not new our you know democratic processes have dealt with technological change in the past it's true that the pace of change is such that maybe we will need more speed in our legislative process and for sure that I think is something we should demand of our representatives and I think for liberal democracies to continue to make progress that's going to be crucial and this past spring customers were surprised to learn that government stockpile these cyber weapons and vulnerabilities and don't actually tell you about them what do you think governments should be doing instead of just think they should disclose them to the companies so that we can fix these bugs I think it's a terrible thing to do to stockpile anything because as we know that these just can be used in unintended ways by people who can get access to them so I think the most important thing for us around security is to recognize the shared responsibility we have especially in times the this web digital technology is so pervasive in all walks of life and infrastructure and parts of our economy that we all come together to make sure that security and operational security yet all times is in being improved and stockpiling of any zero-day issues is not going to be helpful were you surprised when it happened I mean we of course knew of this particular one because it was disclosed and therefore we had fixed it and the reality was there was a patch for it on Windows 10 the issue with some of these things is where we need to make sure that everybody is updated and patched because one weak link in one area can propagate especially in a connected world like ours so that's why I think of this as even a shared responsibility of governments first responders like us as tech companies and even our customers and partners I mean this is where I think there's multiple things that need to happen one is to say that this trust in that this updates and patches are in fact one keeping them secure that's a communications that challenge the second thing is that customers are going to evaluate that based on the those patches to not only secure them but make sure that their apps are not broken and they continue to improve and so this is place where we've invested a lot when we think about Windows 10 as a service this is one of the foundational changes we have made where now instead of thinking of these is massive upgrades it's a continuous service that manages to keep you productive and secure and with artificial intelligence robotics to get it right I mean first of all I think AI is a technology that first can help empower people that's clearly where we're focused on when I look at seeing AI which is an application we just launched for anybody with visual impairment they can go download this app that uses latest cutting-edge computer vision technology in our cloud to give anyone the ability to see and in fact Angela Mills was a colleague of mine was just telling me about how it's changed her life inside of Microsoft she can go into our cafeteria or order food using this app with conference walk into conference rooms with confidence because she knows she's walking into the right conference room or what we've done with our OneNote and word learning tools anyone who has dyslexia can now use AI to be able to read better the latest release of Windows 10 has this capability called I gaze which is something that we learned working with Steve Gleason and the ALS patients to saying if you all you have is the eye muscle and the gaze can you help you type so I think technology and in particular AI can in fact bring more empowerment more inclusiveness and at the same time we should be clear-eyed about displacement clear-eyed about unintended consequences like any other technology and work both skilling so that you know people can find the jobs of the future create new jobs and lastly I think have a set of policy decisions that really help people as they go through this change and you talked a little about the apps and technologies that help people and there's been a big push by Microsoft it seems to create tech that is accessible to everybody yeah I mean I think as I was mentioning with some of the examples I do believe computers and computing and breakthroughs like AI can absolutely bring more people to fully participate in our society in our economy I'm personally very passionate about it and be informed by even my own son's experience who's got cerebral palsy and so that's something that I believe I care deeply about and I see designers engineers and all professionals inside of Microsoft come together with some of these breakthroughs when we do this annual reek of hackathon and I'm amazed to see what all comes out of these because people come together because every family is touched by someone who needs technology so that they can fully participate and they have more of their accessibility needs met and it's fantastic to see some of the innovation that's coming out not only is this innovation helping everybody but in particular those who need the most you know it's always hard to pick your favorite but I've written in the book about three technologies that we are hard at work on and I think they're all big fundamental shifts mixed reality this is what we started with hololens and now even the windows mixed reality headsets that are gonna come out this holiday the combination of these are gonna make it possible for people to collaborate in ways that are going to be completely life-changing in fact Ford is using some of this technology to change the way they bring designers manufacturing and sales people together so mixed reality I think is one a I we already talked about how a AI is really bringing about all of you know whether it's Cortana and how it saves me every day by reminding me of the commitments I've made an email or learning tools in one no does the seeing AI application or and in fact I'm also excited about what quantum computing could mean we're reaching the limits of physics with the Moore's law we do need some fundamental breakthroughs because for all of the progress we've made there are some unsolved problems how do you find a catalyst that can absorb the carbon so that we can tackle global warming it's an unsolved computational problem and I think in order to be able to solve that problem we need new computing power and something like the quantum computer can in fact definitely be an answer I in fact to help me explain it I had to get a Fields Medal winner in math and two physicists and one computer scientists all onstage with me just earlier this week but the if you think about the corn maze and you said let's solve that problem of finding a through a corn maze and used a classical computer you essentially brute-force your way which is you start down a path and you hit a block you retrace and you start down on another path what if instead of trying to trace each path at one time you could trace all of the paths that are in front of you simultaneously in parallel that's I think the intuition the simple intuition behind behind quantum it is the ultimate parallel computer where it's not about a bit being 1 or 0 but they can be 1 and 0 and that I think creates computational power that grows exponentially not linearly one of the things that we are working a lot with is a lot of the auto companies that are all you know working on their own self-driving programs we are partnered very deeply with many of them providing some of the core cloud technology it's amazing to see that cars now are gonna probably be the modern big computers on wheels because they're gonna have more GPU power than any desktop computer and so to me to see that happening broadly you know we were working with manufacturing companies that are putting all kinds of sensors and cameras and automating manufacturing processes so there's not a part of our economy that is now not digital or not software driven so I'm excited about being able to now have what we do participate and in fact have great feedback cycles with them when you look at Apple now I'm definitely not going to speak to our apples you know innovation agenda but we are happy to partner with Apple we are happy to partner with any other company Facebook and others who are doing innovation and find places where we can both address customer needs we have thrilled to have all our software on iOS and I hope you download them as well and in the book you actually gave a story about some flak you took at a conference for women when you said if you wanna raise you'll get a raise and you shouldn't speak up and you kind of caught some flak for that and in a way you were going to realize that you had a bias you didn't know you have can you explain a little how you came to realize that yeah I mean the answer I gave in retrospect was completely wrong in fact Maria Clara was kind enough to even explain it to me on stage which is I was talking I was taking the question literally an answering based on my experience that is not the context of the question the context of the question at a Women's Conference was what are you as a CEO doing to help women make progress in they carrier understand the bias in the system as opposed to talk about trusting the system and that's the realization coming back even talking to all of the may amazingly accomplished women at Microsoft in my own leadership team I was able to really get in touch with how we can do a lot more to help women make more progress not only do we need to bring more women and ethnic minorities into Microsoft but then how do you make sure that they're able to do their best work feeling cluded make carrier progress and so that's definitely a huge agenda for us and we continue to push on it I know when you're on stir you mention that you just said whatever your mentor told you how do you spread that what people might be learning is actually wrong and they need to listen I mean one of the things that we definitely look to do is to make sure that things like these unconscious bias training are not just checkbox items for people but are really learning moments because in some sense life's experience is what helps us develop increasing levels of empathy and empathy is not just a nice thing to have it's an existential thing for us because we are in the business of meeting unmet unarticulated needs or customers we are not going to be able to do that if we don't first represent our customers across the globe or all the ethnicities all of the genders and we need to be then really go after that with an open mind and so I think that making sure that this is not viewed some kind of an extracurricular activity we're at the core of our business but at the same time using this as a teaching moment in the learning moment is how we are approaching it do you worry about those biases being pre-programmed I think it's one of the more important issues for us to make sure that things like training data are not biased and one of the best ways to ensure that what you do in whether it's the programs the algorithms the training regimen are not biased is to make sure you have diversity of engineers who are designing that that's one of the great ways we in fact used to make sure that we're testing these products for that you know diversity and lack of bias okay I get up put on my running shoes get on a treadmill and you know at least get a half-hour in that's the way I get to the energy I need I try definitely not do emails on the treadmill but the best way to start the day as I said is the first thing is a cup of coffee it had the treadmill and what about your evening the last thing I do before going to bed is read my OneNote notes for the meetings next day
