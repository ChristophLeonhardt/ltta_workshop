Laura: TIME NOW FOR THE SEEN AND THE UNSEEN SEGMENT WHERE WE EXPOSE WHAT IS BEHIND THE BIG CULTURAL STORIES OF THE DAY. WHY FACEBOOK WANTS YOU TO SEND THEM YOUR NUDE PHOTOS. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE DOING THIS SEGMENT. HERE TO EXPLAIN THIS IS THE "NEW YORK TIMES" BEST SELLING AUTHOR OF THE CHILDREN SERIES AND THE FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. RAYMOND, WHAT IS THE STORY? FACEBOOK WANTS YOUR NUDE PHOTOS? THEY WANT YOUR NUDE PHOTOS. PREEMPTIVELY. Laura: WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE NUDE PHOTOS? THAT IS A BIGGER QUESTION. THEY WANT TO FIGHT REVENGE PORN WHERE PEOPLE IN RELATIONSHIPS POST NUDE PICTURES OF THE PARTNER WHEN THE RELATIONSHIP ENDS. Laura: WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? I BET WE COULD NAME A FEW BUT WE WON'T. THEY WANT YOU TO SUBMIT YOUR PHOTOS, THE MOST SECRETIVE PHOTOS YOU HAVE TO FACEBOOK. THEY THEN ENCRYPT THEM, THEY TAKE WHAT THEY CALL A FINGERPRINT OF THE PICTURE SO NOT THE PICTURE THEMSELVES. THEY SAY THEY DON'T STORE IT. IT WILL BE OFF THE SERVER IN A FEW DAYS AND THEY WILL BLOCK THAT IMAGE EVER POSTED ON FACEBOOK. HERE IS THE PROBLEM, LAURA. WHO IS LOOKING AT THESE IMAGES? HOW LONG ARE THEY ON THE SERVER? THE BIGGER QUESTION FACEBOOK HAD A 50 MILLION PERSON BREACH LAST YEAR THEY ADMITTED TO. IN MARCH. THEY ADMITTED TO THIS. HOW SURE ARE WE THEY CAN PROTECT THE IMAGES AND THAT THE EMPLOYERS ARE NOT CATCHPYING THEM COPYING THEM? Laura: WHAT IF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE OTHER NUDE PHOTOS. THIS WHOLE THING IS FORGET "SEEN AND UNSEEN." WE'LL CALL THIS THE END OF THE CIVILIZATION SEGMENT. TOMMY, MAKE A NEW GRAPHIC. TOMMY IS LIKE I DON'T MAKE GRAPHICS. WE SHOULD MOVE ON. Laura: A NEW YORK MAN WHO IS 30 YEARS OLD. MY GOSH. Laura: SUED HIS PARENTS OR SUED BY HIS PARENTS. WE CALL THESE PEOPLE BOOMERANG BATS. YOU THROW THEM OUT TO THE WORLD AND THEN THEY COME BACK AND STAY AT HOME. A 30-YEAR-OLD WHO SAYS LOOK, I'M TRYING TO BE A FATHER. HE HAS A CHILD OF HIS OWN. I'M TRYING TO BE A FATHER AND I NEED TO LIVE WITH MOM AND DAD. THEY GAVE HIM FIVE NOTICES TO GET OUT. FIVE EVICTION NOTICES. THEY DEPRIVED HIM OF FOOD. IS THAT HIM? HE SAT WITH ANOTHER NETWORK AND SAID THIS. Laura: DO WE HAVE THE AUDIO? WHY COULDN'T YOU GUYS RESOLVE THIS WITHOUT THE COURT? I WOULD CONSIDER MUCH OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING TO TRY TO GET ME OUT AS ATTACKS. A THIRD OF MILLENNIALS ARE AT HOME WITH THE PARENTS. Laura: ATTACKS? HOW ABOUT GET A HAIRCUT? IT LOOKS LIKE COUSIN IT. THAT WAS SCARY. HERE IS THE SCARY THING. A THIRD OF THE MILLENNIALS ARE Laura: LOOK AT HIM. THIS HAS GONE UP FROM 25% TO 34%. Laura: HE IS STROKING HIS HAIR. HE DOESN'T HAVE MONEY FOR HAIRCUT. TOUGH TIMES. Laura: IF YOUR KID IS THREATENING TO COME HOME AFTER HE WENT TO COLLEGE OR SOMETHING TURN THE ROOM TO A HOME GYM WITH NO COUCHES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THEN THE JUDGE ORDERED THEM THE JUDGE RULED THAT THE KID HAS TO VACATE, THE MAN HAS TO VACATE. AND THEY ARE CALLING FOR AN INVESTIGATION BY ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. I HOPE THAT IS FOR THE PARENT AND NOT FOR THE SON. NOW THE BIG STORY OF THE NIGHT. Laura: STORMY DANIELS IS GETTING A KEY TO WHAT? NO, TODAY SHE GOT THE KEY TO THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD. THIS IS THE MAYOR JOHN DURAN. LISTEN. AS YOU KNOW, LADY GODIVA RODE NAKED THROUGH STREETS OF ENGLAND TO PROTEST INJUSTICE IN TAXES AND WE HAVE OUR OWN LADY GODIVA IN THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD. SHE HELD HER HEAD UP WITH DIGNITY AND SHE FOUGHT BACK. WHEN SHE FOUGHTS BACK AND MR. AVENATTI FIGHTS BACK, THEY ARE FIGHTING BACK FOR ALL OF US TO GET THE COUNTRY BACK INTO OUR HANDS. Laura: DID HE USE THE WORD "DIGNITY"? DO YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN WEST HOLLYWOOD? THEY HAVE ASKED FOR IMPEACHMENT FOR TRUMP. Laura: IMPEACH THE MAYOR. NOTHING SAYS YOU ARE HONORED LIKE GETTING THE KEY TO THE CITY IN FRONT OF A SEX SHOP OWNED BY A DRAG QUEEN PORN DIRECTOR. THIS IS THE LEVEL OF HONOR BESTOWED ON STORMY DANIELS STAND GREAT STAR RE AND THE GREAT STAR REACTED THIS WAY. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE KEY OPENS, I'M HOPING IT'S THE WINE CELLAR. THIS COMMUNITY HAS A HISTORY OF STANDING UP TO BULLIES AND SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER. I'M SO VERY, VERY LUCKY TO BE PART OF IT. YOU KNOW, THEY SAID SHE WAS A PROFILE IN COURAGE. SHE IS A PROFILE IN CLEAVAGE. I HOPE THE KEY OPENS THE DOOR TO TALBOTS SO WE HAVE FULL COVERAGE. Laura: I THREW MY BLUE CARD IN THE AIR. WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE NFL POLICY. NO KNEELING, $20,000 PENALTY IF A PLAYER DOES IT FOR THE CLUB.
