so Axios with a really interesting new report out about Donald Trump once again thinking about firing the special counsel robert muller i'm gonna get to that in a second let's give you some background first recently a russian politician v Ashla slovnik on off a member of the duma that's the ruling assembly in russia said on live TV that US quote intelligence missed it when Russian intelligence stole the President of the United States interesting and and so where there is smoke sometimes there is fire but look it's okay we have an investigation whether there's smoke or fire they're going to determine and and so if if they were investigating my connections to Russia I wouldn't be worried at all because I love any method connection to Russia or Kazakhstan or anywhere else right so Axios report so Muller is borrowing in hard to the obstruction of justice angle so that's on the issue of Trump firing Comey to block the Russian investigation which he admitted to on national television kind of an amazing moment I told you he's too stupid to do a cover-up anyway they point out also that Republicans that's not Democrats that's Republicans close to the White House say every signed by Muller from his hiring of mafia and money laundering experts to his aggressive pursuit of witnesses and evidence is that he's going for the kill damn so one of the things that Muller is focusing on is Trump originally wrote an explanation why Comey was fired so let's go to that portion they say the angry meandering draft White House justification for firing Comey which was never released but obtained by Muller could be used as evidence of Trump's unvarnished thinking when venting to staff so if he if Trump himself wrote a memo saying I got to get rid of Comey because of the Russian investigation he's doing on me in its textbook obstruction of justice I mean there's the angle of why does he want to obstruct justice so badly probably because he did it okay and that's a whole separate part of but the obstruction of justice itself is a significant crime and when you say oh I'm going to fire a prosecutor because he might prosecute me it doesn't get a body for obstruction of justice than that so now latest reports is actually oh so saying that Trump Associates tell me that's Mike alpha and Mike Allen and Jonathan Swain attack SEOs tell me Trump mused about firing Muller so he's back to thinking this guy's getting close is it time to fire the next prosecutor which by the way would be further obstruction of justice why don't you write a memo about that or safety on national TV again you knucklehead okay but now one associate said the damage would be as horrendous as firing the Pope okay that's right and the only reason you would even contemplate such a thing is if you did it and you think he's gonna find out you did it and unlike a lot of your staffers and a lot of the Republican colleagues of yours you know you did it so two very important petitioners here we started this one earlier saying that if Donald Trump pardons anyone that was involved in this campaign or his administration he should be immediately impeached so I'm not saying do impeachment now let the investigation go and let them find out I have no problem with Muller coming back and if he says look man whether he did it or not we just don't have enough evidence well that's sad day for us and that would be I think that all Trump's danger to the world but I it doesn't mean because I don't like the president or I don't agree with the president or I think he's dangerous that we get to remove him from office that's not how it works there has to be a crime but if you are pardoning people in order to cover up for your crime that's obstruction of justice if you're firing prosecutors or special counsels to cover up for your crime that's obstruction of justice that is a crime and that would be a impeachable offense so we did that one earlier that was TYT Network comm slash porn but today I also want to start this because he's apparently trying to block this investigation every way possible so we're saying if the Ahnold Trump fires Muller he should be impeached for obstruction of justice so these are very straightforward very clear TYT Network comm / obstruction to sign a petition but the reason we have to do these petitions and from time to time they do work as we see with Medicare for all is that yes put pressure on politicians they naturally lead from behind they are they are not bold leaders as a bunch you have to tell them hey listen we greatly object to the president clearly breaking the law if he pardons people who broke the law in order to cover up an event an investigation of himself he should be impeached if he fires a prosecutor looking into his own investigation he should be impeached not before but if he does do it that is textbook obstruction of justice that is a crime and he you have to precede the impeachment because if you don't then then he's above the law and we don't have a present anymore we have a dictator and you're giving him carte blanche sub blanch to break any law and then pardoned himself his family members his administration his campaign officials and and then to fire any prosecutor who dares to investigate him that is where you must draw the line so I hope both Democrats and Republicans get all the pressure in the world to realize that we are a country of laws not of men and that we cannot allow this man to run amuck if he fires smaller impeachment proceedings should start the very next day if
