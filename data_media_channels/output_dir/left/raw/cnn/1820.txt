00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:04,859
there's nowhere that you can see or feel
the pain of this crisis more than at

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,480
this hospital we're seeing rojan joke
men women and children who tell us that

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,769
they have lost their families running
for their lives there's nothing left of

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,480
their home and the ones who are here are
the most badly injured I spoke to a

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,680
doctor who tells me that he is seeing
victims with gunshot wounds he has seen

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,630
landmine injuries I spoke to one woman
she's 30 years old she says that she was

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,800
shot while she was trying to escape
trying to run to safety from Myanmar to

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,570
Bangladesh her two young children were
shot and killed at her side in total she

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,010
lost five members of her family a 13
year old girl talks about the fact that

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,090
she was trying to escape on foot for ten
days she was half an hour from the

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,520
safety of Bangladesh when she was shot
her mother took three bullets another

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,899
man who is the victim of a landmine
explosion has lost parts of both of his

13
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,949
legs police see him here at the hospital
he keeps pointing to his face he's

14
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,100
saying something
and the doctor translated he tells us

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,049
that this man is is pointing to his eyes
and saying that he can't see he's gone

16
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,610
blind there more than a hundred rohesia
refugees were now being treated at this

17
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,689
hospital at more than 370 thousand row
hinges have crossed the border into

18
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,920
Bangladesh from Myanmar since violence
broke out in Myanmar toward the end of

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,159
August the government there says they're
conducting a clearance operation

20
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,330
targeting militants but the refugees
that I'm speaking to here say that they

21
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,340
have come under attack from a military
that has set fire to their villages set

22
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,479
fire to their homes and shot at them
while they're trying to run with their

23
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,720
families for their lives they're here
right now trying to heal they're being

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,710
treated by doctors but once they leave
here they tell me they don't know where

25
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,579
they're going their best guess is that
they will be sent back to overcrowded

26
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:53,399
and under prepared refugee camps where
surviving members of their families may

27
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,880
have ended up by now that's the best
hope that they tell me that they have

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:00:00,000
for now Alexandra field CNN Chittagong
