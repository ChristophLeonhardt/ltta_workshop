somehow as things go on because we've
become so partisan but our standards for
what's normal have changed and and
Donald Trump says stuff every day that
used to be considered as disqualifying
for being president and yet because he
says it over and over and over again the
press just gives up and they just say
what I you know okay well yet they just
stop I was opposed to the war in Iraq
well actually he wasn't but they just
accepted so so the bottom line is is
that we cannot afford suddenly to treat
this like a reality show
