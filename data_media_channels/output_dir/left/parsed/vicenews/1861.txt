we're in suburban New Jersey and it's
not exactly the place you'd expect to
have to come to in order to meet a
Guantanamo detainee but there's a law
student here who's agreed to help us
connect with one of the former detainees
he's gonna put us in touch via Skype
Khalid Mehmood works with attorney mark
Denbo and representing former detainee
look Phoebe nalli did we introduce Simon
to you
he's the interviewer I'm the journalist
Tom Optus since he was released
Luke B has taken up painting he's been
barred from travel and doesn't speak
Russian so there isn't much for him to
do we got acrylics 6 and we got brushes
because I want to do something big
send some boxes for America's most
wanted man you're a really nice guy
Denbo has purchased all these clothes
and supplies for look fee because he
essentially has nothing he was dropped
off in Eastern Kazakhstan in the dead of
winter handcuffed and wearing this his
orange Guantanamo prison jumpsuit a
whole wardrobe abaca like tokyo cameras
ready light blues that oh huh
we flew to Kazakhstan to report on Luke
these new circumstances
Khalid came with us and brought a duffel
bag full of gifts for the exiled
detainee not long after we entered
Lucy's apartment we had company members
of the local Red Crescent and the
migration police came to check our
documents and demanded we leave
Golub hadn't gotten a chance to hand
over his gifts so we asked if we could
film the gift-giving as a compromise it
didn't exactly go smoothly so basically
we come to some kind of an interim
agreement where we're allowed to film
Gollop transferring the gifts that he
brought from America here and then after
that they want us to leave they're very
insistent about it so I think we should
go through with it give the gifts under
the watchful eye of the authorities and
see what happens for sunset okay you
know okay
can we sit down you submit or gonna
leave or I'm not gonna sleep here okay
he's gonna eat and we're gonna leave and
we'll see you tomorrow
eleven o'clock I'll be the first guy
that we're going to charge the phone
it's fast yeah you're agitated
they're saying you're not a free man you
were their client and you don't have
rights no no it's the that's
what they said no no you must try it
I'll give me give me a prisoner document
see tiny we're gonna see them tomorrow I
love it I think let's let's break
anything for today okay see them
tomorrow okay have a good night I hope
you get to eat I'm hungry too I wish we
could eat together I know I know he made
us good but we won't have a chance to do
this now I think we have to go though
