1
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,231
>> Laura: PROSECUTORS,

2
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:14,965
POLITICS, AND PERSONAL AMBITION.

3
00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:16,667
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

4
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:20,003
ANGLE.

5
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:22,072
AS A FORMER CRIMINAL DEFENSE

6
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:24,007
ATTORNEY, I SAW MY SHARE OF

7
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:26,109
INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES CAUGHT

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,744
IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF GOVERNMENT

9
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:29,980
INVESTIGATORS WHO DESPERATELY

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,415
WANTED A TROPHY ON THE WALL.

11
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:34,785
WE KNOW THE SCENES.

12
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,987
A CEO ARRESTED AND CUFFED AT HIS

13
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:38,588
OR HER OFFICE FOR ALL THE

14
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:40,857
EMPLOYEES TO SEE FOR MAXIMUM

15
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:42,159
HUMILIATION.

16
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,794
A PROSECUTOR HOLDING A PRESS

17
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,530
CONFERENCE CLAIMING THE EVIDENCE

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,897
WILL SHOW THAT SOME HIGH PROFILE

19
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:51,101
PERSON IS GUILTY OF MYRIAD

20
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:51,801
CRIMES.

21
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,304
MEANING JAIL FOR THE REST OF HIS

22
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,405
ADULT LIFE.

23
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:56,005
TALL HIGH DRAMA.

24
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:56,806
IT'S ALL LIKE AN EPISODE OF LAW

25
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,609
& ORDER.

26
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:00,777
NOW OF COURSE WE NEED

27
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:02,378
PROSECUTORS TO HELP LOCK UP THE

28
00:01:02,378 --> 00:01:04,747
BAD GUYS, WHETHER THEY ARE

29
00:01:04,747 --> 00:01:05,381
WHITE-COLLAR CRIMINALS OR

30
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:08,785
VIOLENT OFFENDERS.

31
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:09,986
WHEN THEY ARE OPERATING

32
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:10,787
PROFESSIONALLY, TALKING ABOUT

33
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:13,189
PROSECUTORS, AND IN GOOD FAITH,

34
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:13,890
THEY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED FOR

35
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,993
THE PUBLIC SERVICE THEY PROVIDE.

36
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,394
BUT LONG BEFORE TODAY'S IG

37
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:20,396
REPORT WAS RELEASED, COME ON,

38
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:21,798
MOST OF US KNEW THE FBI'S

39
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:25,134
HANDLING OF THE CLINTON EMAIL

40
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:26,969
EXAMPLES OF HOW CASES SHOULD NOT

41
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,372
BE HANDLED.

42
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:30,440
OF COURSE, THE USUAL SUSPECTS

43
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,875
SPENT MOST OF THE DAY

44
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,877
DOWNPLAYING THE FINDINGS OF THE

45
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:36,012
IG.

46
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,381
THE IG FOUND NO POLITICAL BIAS.

47
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:39,115
NO, IT IS JUST RUN-OF-THE-MILL

48
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:42,185
INSUBORDINATION HERE.

49
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,287
>> WE JUST GOT THE SAME KIND OF

50
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:45,588
HAMMER YOU USED TO ANNEAL IN A

51
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:47,156
PAINTING ON THE WALL.

52
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:48,257
THE HILLARY CASE WAS PROPERLY

53
00:01:48,257 --> 00:01:51,594
DECIDED ON THE LAW.

54
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:53,029
THAT'S HEADLINE NUMBER ONE.

55
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,164
NUMBER TWO, NO INDICATION OR

56
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:56,899
EVIDENCE THAT POLITICAL BIASES.

57
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:59,769
>> DEEPLY DISTURBING THE

58
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:02,238
REPUBLICANS REMAIN OBSESSED WITH

59
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:04,373
UNDERMINING OUR INTELLIGENCE AND

60
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:05,007
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

61
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:06,909
>> Laura: OKAY, NICE TRY,

62
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:07,209
NANCY.

63
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,176
THE IG'S FINDINGS SHOW THE

64
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:08,577
OPPOSITE.

65
00:02:08,577 --> 00:02:10,846
AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER, THE

66
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:15,184
EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT FBI DIRECTOR

67
00:02:15,184 --> 00:02:16,218
JIM COMEY OPERATED ACCORDING TO

68
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:17,219
HIS OWN SET OF RULES IN THE

69
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,824
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION.

70
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,592
"COMEY ADMITTED HE CONCEALED HIS

71
00:02:23,592 --> 00:02:25,227
INTENTIONS FROM THE DOJ UNTIL

72
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:26,795
THE MORNING OF HIS PRESS

73
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:27,996
CONFERENCE ON JULY 5, AND

74
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:31,767
INSTRUCTED HIS STAFF TO DO THE

75
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:32,367
SAME.

76
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,403
WE FOUND IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY

77
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:35,804
AND INSUBORDINATE FOR COMEY TO

78
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:36,405
DO SO.

79
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:39,007
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COMEY FACED

80
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:40,776
DIFFICULT CHOICES IN LATE

81
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,010
OCTOBER 2016.

82
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,979
HOWEVER, WE FOUND IT

83
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:44,579
EXTRAORDINARY THAT COMEY

84
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:47,382
ASSESSED THAT IT WAS VESTED THAT

85
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:49,618
THE FBI DIRECTOR NOT SPEAK

86
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:50,352
DIRECTLY WITH THE

87
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,387
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE DEPUTY

88
00:02:52,387 --> 00:02:53,021
ATTORNEY GENERAL."

89
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,190
LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS

90
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,392
TOWN, HE THOUGHT, JIM COMEY,

91
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:59,995
THAT HIS TITLE GAVE HIM A

92
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:00,595
LICENSE TO IGNORE BASIC

93
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:03,598
PROSECUTORIAL PROTOCOL.

94
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:05,100
NO WONDER HE WASN'T ALL THAT

95
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,468
KEEN ON PURSUING HILLARY'S USE

96
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:08,837
OF AN UNSECURED SERVER GIVEN THE

97
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:10,071
FACT THAT WE FOUND OUT TODAY

98
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:15,010
THAT HE HIMSELF WAS USING A

99
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,044
PERSONAL GMAIL ACCOUNT TO

100
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:18,980
CONDUCT GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.

101
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,081
EVEN HILLARY REFERENCED VAT IN A

102
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:21,416
TWEET TODAY.

103
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,184
AND IF YOU, LIKE I, THOUGHT

104
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:25,387
COMEY CAME OFF AS INCURIOUS IN

105
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:26,621
TELEVISION INTERVIEWS FOR THAT

106
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,723
STUPID BOOK OF HIS, CHECK OUT

107
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:29,424
THIS TWEET.

108
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:31,292
HE SAID TODAY IN A TWEET "I

109
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:34,195
RESPECT THE DOJ.

110
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:35,997
IG OFFICE WHICH IS WHY I URGE

111
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:38,032
THEM TO DO THIS REVIEW.

112
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:38,967
THE CONCLUSIONS ARE REASONABLE

113
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:41,169
EVEN THOUGH I DISAGREE WITH THEM

114
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:41,669
EVEN THOUGH I DISAGREE WITH THE

115
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:42,203
THEM.

116
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:45,106
PEOPLE OF GOOD FAITH CAN SEE AN

117
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:47,608
UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION

118
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:48,376
DIFFERENTLY.

119
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:51,312
I PRAY NO DIRECTOR FACES IT

120
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:51,612
AGAIN.

121
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:53,181
THANKS TO IG'S PEOPLE FOR HARD

122
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:53,981
WORK."

123
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:55,683
HE LOST ME AT "PEOPLE OF GOOD

124
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:56,584
FAITH."

125
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:57,618
NOTICE BY THE WAY HOW HE MAKES

126
00:03:57,618 --> 00:04:00,088
HIMSELF OUT TO BE THE VICTIM

127
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:00,388
HERE.

128
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:02,423
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

129
00:04:02,423 --> 00:04:05,560
COMEY SHOULD CHANGE HIS MIDDLE

130
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,395
NAME TO HUBRIS.

131
00:04:07,395 --> 00:04:09,197
THE MAN HAS LEARNED ABSOLUTELY

132
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:10,565
NOTHING FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.

133
00:04:10,565 --> 00:04:12,366
AND REMEMBER, BY THE WAY, THIS

134
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:15,670
IS THE GUY WHO SIGNED OFF ON

135
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,803
THREE FISA APPLICATIONS AND

136
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:20,208
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARY TO

137
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,509
TELL THE FISA COURT THAT HILLARY

138
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:24,412
PAID FOR THE STEELE DOSSIER.

139
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:26,247
THIS IS THE SAME MAN WHO ALLOWED

140
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:28,582
PETER STRZOK, THE FBI AGENT, TO

141
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:30,184
CHANGE THE DESCRIPTION OF

142
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:32,386
MRS. CLINTON'S USE OF THE

143
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:35,790
PRIVATE SERVER FROM GROSSLY

144
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,924
NEGLIGENT TO MERELY EXTREMELY

145
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:37,391
CARELESS.

146
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:38,893
SO AS NOT TO TRIGGER THE

147
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:42,797
UNDERLYING CRIMINAL STATUTE.

148
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:44,331
BUT OF COURSE THERE WAS THIS

149
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:45,066
BREAKING NEWS TO COMPETE WITH

150
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:48,235
THE IG RELEASE TODAY.

151
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:50,004
>> THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL

152
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:52,006
HAD JUST ANNOUNCED A LAWSUIT

ALLEGING THAT THE DONALD J.

TRUMP FOUNDATION WAS ACTUALLY AN

159
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:05,152
EMPTY SHELL.

160
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:07,020

THE LAWSUIT.

168
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:21,401
COME ON.

169
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:23,003
AGAINST THE TRUMP FOUNDATION.

170
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:23,804
IT'S BEYOND SUSPICIOUS.

171
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:25,238
REMEMBER, IT COMES FROM THE

172
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:26,707
NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

173

REMEMBER SENT OUT A FUND-RAISING

179
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:38,218
EMAIL RIGHT AFTER THE

180
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:38,819
INVESTIGATION INTO THE

181
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:41,588
FOUNDATION WAS OPENED.

182
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:44,991
HE IS A TRULY ODIOUS FIGURE WHO

183
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:46,393
ABUSED AND HUMILIATED HIS FEMALE

184
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:48,995
VICTIMS AND THEN USED HIS OFFICE

185
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:50,997
AND HIS POSITION TO THREATEN

186
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:51,631
THEM INTO SILENCE.

187
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:52,165
MARK MY WORDS.

188
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:54,801
WE HAVEN'T HEARD THE LAST OF

189

WHAT HE DID TO HIS VICTIMS.

190
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:59,205

191
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:00,473
CRUSADE, BARBARA UNDERWOOD, WHO

192
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:03,610
SET UP ON TAKING OVER FOR

193
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,179
SCHNEIDERMAN, "I BELIEVE THIS

194
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:07,680
JOB AT THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY IS

195
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,484
THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB I HAVE

196
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:13,586
EVER HAD."

197
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,188
YEAH, LITTLE SUBTLETY THERE.

198
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:17,790
THINK ABOUT IT.

199
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,491
DONALD TRUMP OPERATED A

200
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,794
FOUNDATION THAT HAD ZERO

201
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:22,462
OVERHEAD, NO ADMINISTRATIVE

202
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:27,366
COSTS, AND GAVE AWAY MORE THAN

203
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:28,568
$19 MILLION TO A VARIETY OF

204
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:29,602
CHARITABLE CAUSES.

205
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,370
TRUMP AND HIS COMPANIES

206
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,939
PERSONALLY PORT $8 MILLION INTO

207
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:35,775
THE FOUNDATION.

208
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,643
NOW THERE WAS A MISTAKE AND

209
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:39,178
CONTRIBUTION MADE TO PAT BONDI'S

210
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:39,979
CAMPAIGN BUT IT WAS RECTIFIED

211
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:40,813
ONCE IT WAS DISCOVERED.

212
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:43,649
IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS A

213
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:44,817
PENNY-ANTE STUFF THAT WOULD

214
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:48,054
NEVER BE PURSUED BY THE

215
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:51,190
NEW YORK STATE OF

216
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,224
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IF

217
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:54,393
DONALD TRUMP HADN'T GOTTEN INTO

218
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:54,760
POLITICS.

219
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,595
IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF

220
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:56,629
POLITICIZED LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND

221
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:57,630
ABUSE OF PROCESS.

222
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,431
THIS TIME IT WAS THROUGH A CIVIL

223
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:02,201
ACTION ON THE STATE LEVEL.

224
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:03,903
WHERE WERE THEY, BY THE WAY COME

225
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,237
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHEN THE

226
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:07,206
CLINTON FOUNDATION WAS ACCEPTING

227
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:08,207
FUNDS FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS

228
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:10,176
WHILE HILLARY WAS SECRETARY OF

229
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:10,609
STATE?

230
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:12,244
SOME OF THEM WANTS TO GET

231
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:14,213
MEETINGS WITH HILLARY.

232
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:15,080
MEANWHILE, COMEY AND HIS

233
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,184
POLITICAL ACTIVISTS POSING AS

234
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:19,952
AGENTS VENT THE LEGAL STANDARDS

235
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:20,653
FOR HILLARY CLINTON, ALLOWING

236
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,588
HER TO WALK FREE.

237
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:23,589
AND THEY ASSUMED THAT SHE WAS

238
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:25,491
GOING TO BE GOING INTO THE

239
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:25,891
WHITE HOUSE.

240
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:28,127
LET'S NOT FORGET.

241
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:30,129
CLINTON IS SETTING UP THAT

242
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:33,399
PRIVATE SERVER, MADE UP HER OWN

243
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,733
RULES, JUSTICE COMEY DID IN

244
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,835
CLEARING HER OF ANY CRIMINAL

245
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:37,803
WRONGDOING.

246
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:40,205
MY FRIENDS, THIS IS ALL A

247
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:45,811
HIDEOUS PERVERSION OF JUSTICE.

248
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:47,246
NOW FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER

249
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:48,747
WRAY IS INSISTING THE IG REPORT

250
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:50,949
CLEARS THE FBI, THOUGH, OF

251
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:54,586
STRUCTURAL RESPONSIBILITY.

252
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:57,723
>> NOTHING, NOTHING IN THIS

253
00:07:57,723 --> 00:08:00,992
REPORT IMPUGNS THE INTEGRITY OF

254
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:02,394
OUR WORKFORCE AS A WHOLE.

255
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:03,028
>> I'M SORRY.

256
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:04,596
YOU ARE WRONG.

257
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:05,630
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES.

258
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,132
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE THAT YOUR

259
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:07,866
FELLOW CITIZENS QUESTION WHETHER

260
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:10,602
OR NOT THEY CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE

261
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:11,169
IN THE WORLD'S PREMIER

262
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:14,005
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.

263
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:16,208
>> Laura: REMEMBER WHEN JIM

264
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:16,708
COMEY SAID THIS?

265
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,777
>> IT MAKES ME MILDLY NAUSEOUS

266
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:21,046
TO THINK WE MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME

267
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:22,447
IMPACT ON THE ELECTION.

268
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:22,948
>> Laura: [LAUGHS]

269
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:27,185
IT MAKES ME WILDLY NAUSEOUS

270
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:29,788
READING THIS IG REPORT AND

271
00:08:29,788 --> 00:00:00,000
LEARNING HOW COMEY AND HIS
