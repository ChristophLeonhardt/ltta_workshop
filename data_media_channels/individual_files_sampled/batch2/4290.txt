we begin today with the Russia recusal brand new reporting reveals that the president personally demanded Attorney General Jeff Sessions reverse his decision to step aside in the Russia investigation did the president cross the legal line we're gonna get into all of that with my panel but first I want to explain exactly what we're talking about this all comes back to what the president sees as sessions original sin recusing himself from the Russia probe remember most legal experts say that was the right thing to do but guess who was furious the president according to new reporting this morning the time says after sessions made the announcement mr. Trump would not take his calls and refuse to speak to him even about policy he got the quote presidential silent treatment so sessions he flew down to mar-a-lago think about that on the government's time to see the president face-to-face at that point the New York Times says quote mr. Trump who had told aides that he needed a loyalist overseeing the inquiry berated mr. sessions and told him he should reverse his decision an unusual and potentially inappropriate request mr. sessions refused we should mention that Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani told The Times he has not discussed sessions recusal with mr. Trump but Giuliani felt it was a reasonable request within the president's authority this morning Oversight Committee Chairman Republican trey Gowdy said the president's actions were understandable given the circumstances if I were the president and I pick someone to be the country's chief law enforcement officer and they told me later oh by the way I'm not going to be able to participate and the most important case in the office I would be frustrated too that's how I read that is senator sessions why didn't you tell me this before I picked you the president actually quoted congressman Gowdy this morning who said he could have picked someone else and the president added quote I wish did but when give him the chance to fire Jeff Sessions the president he's chosen not to remember after rod Rosenstein appointed Muller in May mr. Trump reportedly insulted Jeff Sessions and accused him of disloyalty sessions actually offered to quit but the president he refused to accept it and back in July mister trunk reportedly told then chief of staff Ryan's previous to force sessions to resign but neither previous nor the president followed through why does all of this matter two reasons number one it could add more fuel to Muller's case for obstruction of justice both in relation to Jeff Sessions and Jim Comey number two the relationship between the president and the Attorney General has real-world consequences according to The Times current and former White House officials say the two men still do not get along and barely speak outside of cabinet meetings that is despite the fact that sessions he has been the driving force behind the president's immigration policies a huge part of mr. Trump's first term and if you're talking about actually putting policy in place Jeff Sessions may be the most effective member of the president's entire cabinet and yet because of his refusal sessions has been on the outs with the president for over a year that's a lot to get through I want to ring my panel and Matt Miller he served as chief spokesperson for the Justice Department Eddie Glaude Princeton University professor Phil Rucker in the house we rarely get him in New York he of course is the White House bureau chief for the Washington Post a Navy Stoddard associate editor and columnist for Real Clear Politics Matt I've got to go to you first I haven't seen you on Twitter this morning but no doubt you're in Fuego New York Times says the president's demand that sessions reverse his recusal was quote unusual and potentially inappropriate but was it illegal couldn't the president make the argument I want to have the Attorney General that I like yeah he could make that argument but the only reason he would care that who is supervising this investigation because let's remember when he went sessions were accused it went to another Trump point d-rod Rosenstein the only reason reason he should really care is if he wants the investigation shut down if he wants the investigation ended and look we can come up with these kind of theoretical arguments about maybe the president just wants his Attorney General to oversee the most important case but that flies in the face of the facts that we look at all the time which is that the president wants this investigation shut down he wanted Jim Comey to shut down the investigation into Mike Flint he fired him when you wouldn't back off the Russian investigation he's tweeted over and over we see reports of him trying to shut the investigation down privately so it's a little bit of absurd to kind of create this theoretical construct when there's a bunch of evidence of what the president's intentions are staring us right in the face witch hunt I just need to remind the audience there have been 20 indictments five guilty pleas and the lawyer from Skadden Arps is currently in jail okay a B do you see this as potentially significant when it comes to Bob Miller's investigation well Rudy Giuliani wants us to not think so because he said that the president did not demand that he unrep used he just which were to bury the investigation he did that demanding the ton recuse does not necessarily mean burying the investigation which means that he did ask him and it means that sessions is much more of a consequential player in this probe than we understood before there could be many more discussions like this that have yet to have been reported how deep it goes into obstruction of justice and I'm not a lawyer will obviously depend on underlying crime so if they come up with if they say there's you know collusions not a crime that's one thing obstruction of justice it'll be argued by the president's counsel that it's within his authority to do these things to make these demands and and and ask his surrogates his officials employees to do this or that that it's perfectly legal if they come up with underlying crimes like financial crimes then they will need to speak to the president about whether or not there was corrupt intent willful intent and that will make the obstruction of justice charge look a lot different than it might right now okay Phil under any circumstances Jeff Sessions would be the shining star in Trump's cabinet Trump's immigration plans policy that's what he hangs his hat on that's all jeff Sessions if you think about what a conservative is really happy about they're thrilled about all the judges who are put in place yet Jeff Sessions is persona non grata with au Presidente and he was the star of the cabinet until the day he recused himself from arrest investigation without a minute into the administration but he was poised to be a real leader he was ideologically in sync with President Trump he was a loyal campaign surrogate he helped staff the whole government during the transition all of a sudden he makes this recusal on the Russia case which by the way was his really his duty as Attorney General to recuse himself because of his personal conflict of interest in that investigation and Trump wants to get rid of them of course Trump won't pull the trigger and actually get rid of him because doing so would create all sorts of legal peril for the president potentially well the president continues to obsess over this narrative calling as I said calling the investigation a witch-hunt now this term that has no fact behind it Spygate and I want to share what he said last night in Nashville so how do you like the fact they had people infiltrating our campaign can you imagine can you can you imagine people infiltrating our campaign is there anybody in this big beautiful arena right now that's infiltrating our campaign would you please raise your hand that would take courage no sir I can't believe that in you know who else can't Republicans and conservatives we're seeing more and more come out in support of the FBI and specifically Bob Miller watch president Trump himself in the Comey memo said if anyone connected with my campaign was working with Russia I want you to investigate it and it sounds to me like that is exactly what the FBI did to call the investigation rig than illegitimate illegitimate its ratified by six federal judges it's quite legitimate I think it's reaching too far when he attacks its legitimacy Eddie do you think when you hear a trey Gowdy or an Andrew Napolitano that's going to affect Trump's narrative with his supporters absolutely not absolutely not what we're seeing I think with some Republicans and conservative commentators and Republican lawmakers is that there's some bit of distance some gap some light between Trump and them they see the blue wave coming they're thinking about their own survival and so now they have some moment to be critical of Trump strategy strategies and tactics but with regards to his base with regards to those folks who will support him if he shot somebody on Fifth Avenue right there this is this strategy of distraction and deliverable D legitimation of the legitimation will work is working right and what's interesting about this is we don't remember at least we seem to forget Obama administration the Obama administration wiretapped my campaign unmasking now Spygate we can list there all of these rabbit holes that he sends us down and then we follow him and the next thing you know we're looking over here while he's trying to cover up what's really it's all going to work with that base until China starts buying all of their soy beans from Brazil until trickle-down economics doesn't trickle down to that middle of American worker because that is what so many people are hoping for and they're willing to stomach this noise because they think he's going to offer them a different life Phil is Spygate president Trump's get-out-of-jail-free card he thinks it is I talked to Rudy Giuliani a few days ago who said Trump is convinced this it's working he feels like his polling is improving he feels like he's put Muller in this partisan box so that anybody who agrees with Trump therefore thinks Muller's investigation is a Republican he is a Republican but but they're creating this political frame around a Russian investigation that when it began a majority of Americans thought was the right investigation thought was appropriate thought mower was honest and okay then if Trump thinks Spygate is just get out of jail free card what is the rest of the Republican Party think trey gowdy has come out where's Mitch McConnell where's Paul Ryan well Mitch McConnell to his credit after these briefings last week did say that he found nothing surprising and they still defended the Miller investigation in an interview on Fox News so that was actually that was notable trey Gowdy has been attacked by Lou Dobbs within the last few days as being a phony Marco Rubio over the weekend said that these two individuals that were being tracked by our law enforcement agencies because they had basically wrong for all intents and purposes Russian agents a cargo page had been on our radar screen since 2013 had nothing to do the Trump campaign he was been targeted by Breitbart so Republicans are watching the Republicans who step up get attacked by the alright and the Trump media and it's really hard if you're not retiring like trey gowdy or source senator flake to stand up and say these kinds of things but if you speak to them privately they know it's true they listen to Andrew Napolitano the judge described why it's not illegitimate and they want to stay as quiet as possible but if you if you look at who has the authority who's seen the most intelligence mark Meadows the Congress in North Carolina of the freedom caucus or trey Gowdy Devin Nunez has deferred to trey Gowdy to be the expert in this area but still they want to create an alternative narrative hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for
