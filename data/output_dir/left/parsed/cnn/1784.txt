as Hillary Clinton was toasted with
cheers for her new book she roasted
Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the
grave offense called manspreading
men spreading the practice whereby a man
adopts a sitting position with his legs
wide apart he would man spread and there
are plenty of pictures to prove it
though it could have been worse do you
think maybe you could close your legs a
bit no I'm good now we already knew
about Putin's provocative posture he's
got that kind of slouch
looking like the bored kid in the back
of the classroom Hillary has also said
Putin wouldn't look at her and of his
manspreading she wrote it was as if to
say I take what I want and I have so
little respect for you that I'm going to
act as if I'm at home lounging in my
bathrobe big surprise after all Putin is
used to lounging in public bare chested
and he seems to man spread with everyone
actually many male leaders from
President Trump to Israel's prime
minister man spread right back Hillary
didn't just call Putin out
she acted it out every time I met with
him it would be but in her attempt to
mimic me and spreading she spread only
her arms too modest a man spread all the
way oh for god sakes
