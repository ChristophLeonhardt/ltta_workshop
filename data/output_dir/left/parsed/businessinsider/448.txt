I think it is important for companies
like ours to have a set of principle
that governs some of the most important
things like privacy and security and our
immigration and take a stance ultimately
we also should recognize that they are
not the elected officials we don't have
some mandate from the people of this
country and so therefore both the
legislative process and the framework of
laws that come out should govern us all
but when there isn't that structure in
place it is up to us as companies and
leaders to take principled stance
