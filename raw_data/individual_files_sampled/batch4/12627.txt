michael moore colluded with the russians or at least he was a useful idiot exploited by the russians and we have photographic evidence none of this should surprise us however as the american left has been working with moscow for over a century to undermine American institutions and culture we will analyze this latest episode and the long history of Democrats colluding with Russia then on this day in history what we conservatives can learn from American colonists adopting the Indians practice of scalping to fight against them I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show it's a nice way to start a Tuesday is to talk about scalping to talk about the advantages of scalping and it actually was a very nice way to start a Tuesday yes I you know I wake up in the morning I've have a little cough fa in my cup I think I had a little extra cough every day and I look at the news and what do I see but Michael Moore colluded with Russia after 18 months of Democrats telling us the Donald Trump colluded with Russia colluded with Russia we now find out that actually was the Democrats who I guess sort of colluded with Russia and really nobody technically colluded with Russia so I should I should take that back about Michael more technically he didn't collude I guess the indictments last week the Malheur indictments showed us that there were a lot of Russians in the United States masquerading as Americans so they might have said okay we've got this dirt on Trump or this dirt on Hillary and the people talking to them would have thought that those were Americans they might have talked to campaign volunteers they might have been on Facebook buying advertising or whatever but ironically one of the big news stories that came out of the indictments last week is that apparently nobody actually colluded with Russia they just talked to people who they thought were Americans now this is this would not be the same by the way for someone like Democrat congressman Adam Schiff who thought that he was talking to the Russians about compromising things from Donald Trump thought that he was talking to the Ukrainians but he wasn't really that was just a big hoax so actually that would be collusion even though there was nothing there and with the Russians even though there might have been something there that isn't collusion now there's a lot of collusion we've known on the American right that for a long time that this story was total nonsense Van Jones also admitted that and called it a nothing burger Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein also knew that she admitted we didn't don't have any evidence for Trump colluding with Russia none of this though should surprise us whatsoever that the American left has been duped by the Russians or has been working alongside the Russians because American lefties have allowed themselves to be used by Russia for a very very long time in the case of more more attended an anti Trump rally organized by Russians just days after the 2016 election and this was apparently part of the strategy Russia has been in trophy in our elections for a very long time since the Russian Revolution in the early 20th century and I suppose this year was no different so they appeared to have run ads for candidates like Donald Trump or say Bernie Sanders and then after President Trump won they started pushing these rallies for Hillary Clinton and for saying that Donald Trump is not my president they actually held one on November 12th that was explicitly called Trump is not my president more attendent it he posted on Facebook quote at today's Trump Tower protest he couldn't come down he wouldn't come down here's my facebook live coverage so he was broadcasting from the event he was a central figure there that said Michael Moore tends to be a central figure wherever he goes in this case he was also a central figure the Malheur indictment makes crystal clear that this rally was organized by Russians more you'll also recall performed a one-man show on Broadway against Donald Trump last year so he I think was at the Belasco theater in New York not even the Russians could prop up that theatrical atrocity there it got terrible reviews that fell short of its projected ticket sales and it's gross no surprise at all but Michael Moore has been working this angle for a long time and the Russians have been happy to use him for it so by all available evidence it was Democrats working with Russians on this election President Obama knew about apparent Russian interference but he did his best to quiet any allegations as president from tweeted this morning quote there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections there's no evidence that this has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so I'd invite mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes this is all Trump's tweet Trump's tweet goes on the President Obama quote just before the election that's because he thought crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn't want to rock the boat when I easily won the electoral college the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems absolutely right I am so glad that Twitter exists I know it's shadow banning conservatives from shadow banning me but at least Donald Trump can skip the mainstream media get his message out to many more people than read the New York Times this is exactly right if the Obama administration knew about Russian interference knew about this ahead time the only reason that he wouldn't talk about it is so that he wouldn't deal Ajith amis president Hillary Clinton's first year in office the Clinton administration he was hoping that Hillary Clinton would just be elected they wouldn't have to deal with this at all and it could keep this Russia stuff under wraps because there's a lot of Russia nonsense to go around but we also shouldn't be surprised by that Barack Obama has actually colluded with Russia on camera on microphone and we caught him here is so that was Barack Obama talking 2012 to Russian puppet leader Medvedev it was close ally of Vladimir Putin a puppet of Vladimir Putin and he whispers to him on what he thought was a private conversation though he had a hot mic on him he said I will have more flexibility after my election now to translate that for you that means I am going to lie to the American people about my intentions with regard to Russia but I will do something different than what I say that I'm going to do with regards to Russia I will have more flexibility I have to pretend to hold one policy view toward Russia during the election but then I will change my view after I am elected to which Medvedev responds like boris and Natasha he says davia transmits this information to Vladimir Dada I want to your blood so we know that that is actual collusion President Obama didn't think he was talking to an American but it was secretly a Russian President Obama didn't think this was a public forum where he was saying one the same thing to the American people as to the Russian leader he was lying to the American people speaking secretly to the Russian leader and trying to get through his final election we know according to an FBI informant that during the Obama administration Moscow sent millions of dollars to the US with the expectation that it would go into Bill Clinton's slush fund well Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and oversaw the reset in Russian relations including the sale of American uranium reserves to Russians even that shouldn't surprise us the American Left has been working alongside Russia to undermine American institutions and culture for a very very long time for 100 years here is a quick historical retrospective to begin right after the Russian Revolution in 1919 just two years after the left-wing American journalist Lincoln Steffens accompanied William bullit a State Department official on a three-week trip to the Soviet Union Stephan's admitted that the revolution appeared quote confusing and difficult but he insisted that the Soviet Russia was quote a revolutionary government with an evolutionary plan now those revolutionaries were the Bolsheviks their plan involved taking the royal family Russian royal family into their basement and shooting them dead that was I think on July 18th sometime in July 1918 Tsar Nicholas his wife Alexandra and their five children aged 22 21 19 1713 murdering 13 year-old innocent girls that and killing the leaders of your country that's that was the the plan that they had Stephan's made excuses for these Bolshevik Horrors by explaining that the Bolsheviks required quote a temporary condition of evil which is made tolerable by hope and a plan here's that plan again they've always got a plan this is this is a characteristic of the utopian left don't worry about the reality around you think about our theoretical plan who cares if it works in practice does it work in theory so when Stephan's returned to the US and lobbied for taxpayer funds to help the Communists to help the Soviets he gushed I have seen the future and it works this line by the way this early just as early as it could possibly be leftist American collusion with Russia was really the beginning of the modern American conservative movement William F Buckley Jr when he founded the National Review used this line he said we a conservative as one who stands with word history yelling stuff people have wondered what that means we're trying to stop history we're trying to do this for that it's a direct response to the Lincoln Steffens line I've seen the future and it works Bill Buckley says I've seen that future I don't like the way it works I notice it involves a lot of dead people and starving people and no Liberty whatsoever I want to stand with word history yelling stop conservatives should be doing precisely the same thing today but it was at that point to a facet a central facet of American fusionist conservatism the creation of Bill Buckley that we could unite traditionalists and libertarians because both of them were opposed to Soviet Communism that was there was the central aspect there which is why the conservative movement after the Cold War and in this new era is going to look different than it did during the Buckley erage it simply has to the central premise of the American political Coalition for conservatives and no longer exists so it now has to pivot a little bit Stephan's was a typical American journalist who railed against business profit Christianity in the church he regularly railed against all of these things is it any wonder that the American Left more broadly found common cause with communist thugs is it any wonder that that kinship persists today Lincoln Steffens could work for CNN Lincoln Steffens could work for the New York Times there isn't much of a change you see all of the snide remarks that he made about the church and Christianity and profit and capitalism and economic freedom you see that on CNN and the New York Times all the time it's a hundred years later they've learned nothing moving on from Lenin to Stalin and from one morally idiotic lefty journalist to another we get to New York Times reporter Walter durante it had to come back to the New York Times Walter a Pulitzer Prize winning New York Times reported won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for his reporting on Soviet Russia he he wanted because he lived in Soviet Russia for 14 years after the Bolshevik seized power so unlike Stephan's who was just there for a little bit of time a couple weeks this guy lived there for 14 years during that time Walter Durant a New York Times Walter Durant II covered up Stalin's most heinous crimes including the hallo domme war the the famine in Ukraine now you might say well it was an innocent error he was an idiot he was a dummy not so Walter Durante attacked journalists like British reporter Gareth Jones who were actually reporting on those famines who were actually reporting on the crimes of Stalin Jones had seen firsthand the starvation in Ukraine he wasn't trying to guess anything he saw it firsthand he reported about it elected Walter durante right durante Road quote in the middle of the diplomatic fuel diplomatic fuel in the middle of the diplomatic duel between Great Britain and the Soviet Union over the accused British engineers there appears from a British source that would be our guy Gareth a big scare story in the American press about famine in the Soviet Union with quote thousands already dead and millions menaced by death from starvation any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda the food's shortage however which has affected the whole population in the last year and particularly in the grain producing provinces Ukraine North Caucasus and the lower Volga has however caused heavy loss of life yeah okay so some people have died there's no famine there's no come on don't there's no famine this was all nonsense as scholars from across the political spectrum now agree the famine was caused by the government stealing private property by the government collectivizing farms but you could see this today you would see this today on mainstream news reports we see oh you know the North Korean dictator Asst the North Korean dragon lady isn't she so lovely oh we just don't understand them we Americans think of North Korea as a backwards communist hellhole that enslaves and tortures and murders and terrorizes all of its citizens all the time but you know it's a it's a nice place they've got a nice face of North Korea these are almost verbatim quotes from CNN and the coverage at the Olympics they're doing exactly the same thing it's so easy now they look back even lefty journalists now say ah Durante probably got it a little bit wrong didn't he but they don't realize they are getting it wrong every single day the more they cover up for China the crimes by China the more they cover up for crimes in god-awful leftie socialist states like Venezuela in the Americas throughout the Americas throughout the 60s 70s 80s today they covered up for communists and socialists in the Caribbean and in in Latin America they still do it they love Hugo Chavez's American celebrities American journalists go down and hang out with shop as they did until he died no back to durante durante reported stent Stalin's propaganda directly just as the lefties report propaganda from today durante reported Stalin's propaganda not only while he lived in Moscow he reported Stalin's propaganda directly after he left Moscow he even defended the purges he defended Stalin's show trials of 1938 in which Stalin murdered his political enemies on mass he defended those as a legitimate it isn't just that I know what you're thinking Michael Walter Durant he worked for the New York Times he was a big dummy who didn't know anything that actually isn't even true I mean he was a dummy and he did work for the New York Times he knew he was lying this is New York Times reporter pule a surprise winning New York Times reporter elite total gloss of credibility you know a global elite who he knows what's better he probably was well educated Walter Durant he confided with friends that he knew the scale of death and devastation but he just didn't want to report him son lefties who can't come to grips with the fact that Walter Durant II covered up the the crimes of the Soviet Union that he might have just been a committed communist he might have just supported the Soviet enterprise there are now suggesting maybe they had some dirt on it maybe they were blackmailing him there's really no evidence of that if they were it's still awful cowardice but there's really no evidence of that I think as we see today I don't think that the lefty thugs around the world are blackmailing Anderson Cooper or blackmailing brian Stelter or blackmailing all these other people at CNN in the New York Times I think their fellow travelers I think they have an ideological agreement with them I don't think they were blocked blackmailing Walter Cronkite when Walter Cronkite single-handedly ended the war in Vietnam as we were winning it declare defeat as we were winning the war as Walter Cronkite was giving speeches for the world Federalist conferences around the world saying that we need a single government to govern the entire world I think they were fellow travelers they too ideological CIMMYT similarities by the way the Pulitzer committee still hasn't revoked Durante's prize walter Durante flatly knowingly denied a major famine major crimes of stalin in print and a lambasted journalists who were reporting the truth and they still won't resent his Pulitzer Prize because that's the way mainstream journalism works folks so moving on to the mid 20th century in 1948 the Soviet Communist Party set up the euphemistically named World Peace Council to promote Soviet interests abroad and campaign against nuclear weapons since at the time only the u.s. possessed them so they were they didn't campaign against nuclear weapons once the Soviets got those weapons by the way it was just they would only campaign and agitate for US disarmament so useful idiots on the American left who joined the Soviet backed propaganda machine who were they they didn't they didn't really get anybody did they they get a lot of high-profile people WB Dubois the civil rights activist he joined the Soviet backed propaganda shop the musician Paul Robeson the novelist and screenwriter Howard fast many prominent Americans gave them cover as a subsidiary organizations under the WPC included the Christian Peace Conference the International Organization of Journalists the International Union of Students the World Federation of Democrat youth the World Federation of Scientific workers the World Federation of trade unions and the World Peace Esperanto movement which should be no surprise they were I know a little bit of Esperanto this is this made-up language that was supposed to be it was made up by utopians to be the universal second language and I learned a good bit of it when I was in high school because I thought it was funny you can learn the whole language in about 10 days so one time I was up for an acting job so I thought was an acting job I go in for it and they say what language do you speak what languages I said okay these languages oh and a little bit of Esperanto they said oh that's good client number one speaks Esperanto I said this is an event for George Soros said how did you know that I said George Soros is the only guy in the world who speaks Esperanto and the long and short of that is I ended up being they hired actors to be sommelier at George Soros's wedding so I actually was in attendance at George Soros's wedding it's pretty wild I know it was shocking sometimes I don't even believe it but I was there I did see it happen as a sommelier a very very funny of course George Soros supports the World Peace Esperanto movement of course George Soros supports these things these were ways to break down and not only national borders but to break down the culture and the global leadership of the United States it is still happening today during his wedding people were giving speech very prominent people were giving speeches about George's love of Esperanto how he's always propping up Esperanto groups which nobody speaks again George Soros and I are two of the only people who speak any Esperanto the face of the earth Soviets back to the Soviets that's just that's just to show you that this thing is still persisting today this influence is still persisting today even after the end of the Cold War Soviets formed or influenced countless organizations to undermine American institutions that includes the Abraham Lincoln Brigade wait I think the last soldier and that died a year or two ago that was this brigade basically of Communists that were recruited from America to go fight in the Spanish Civil War the American Youth Congress the American youth Congress received ample support from First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt that was another front for communists another front for Soviet Communism the CPUSA the Communist Party USA obviously the Socialist Workers Party in the United world Federalists one of which were organization Walter Cronkite which later speak at much of the opposition to the Vietnam War and other domestic unrest throughout the US during those years was funded and initiated by the Soviets but that isn't where it ends it was executed it was carried out by the American left this this persisted throughout those decades a lot of the domestic unrest that we look at had agitation had sources in Moscow and was just carried out by the dummies who were convinced by totalitarian thugs in the United States now fast forward a little bit in nineteen eighty drunk-driving man-slaughtering Senator Ted Kennedy twice attempted to collude with Russia with the Soviets to gain a leg up in the presidential election he used Democrat Senator John Tunney to request KGB help in sabotaging Jimmy Carter so when we're talking about Donald Trump we're saying that this election was totally unfair we need to redo the 2016 election it was stolen because some Russians might have run Facebook ads making fun of what a terrible candidate Hillary Clinton is meanwhile 1980 a major Democrat senator from an incredibly important American political family is requesting help from the KGB the Russian Secret Service to sabotage President Jimmy Carter because he wanted to primary him and and become president even though he'd killed that girl in 1983 Kennedy again solicited Soviet help in trying to undermine Ronald Reagan offering to set up TV interviews in the u.s. to make the Soviets come across as peaceful so wasn't enough in 1980 apparently the Soviets didn't do well enough by our pal in 1980 so next go-around he says hey let's call their Soviets up again let's see if they can help me out on this race now I don't want you to feel too bad for Jimmy Carter here because in 1980 while Ted Kennedy was trying to use the Soviets to defeat Jimmy Carter Jimmy Carter was reaching out to the Soviets to undermine Ronald Reagan it is actually a little bit like today when you say wait he was colluding with this Russian and he with this Russian this and that it's not exactly cut and dry but we do have examples of these two Democrats fighting with each other to ultimately take down Ronald Reagan the only guy here who wasn't colluding with the Russians was Ronald Reagan who defeated them and destroyed their empire eight years later in 1984 Democrat Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill requested that the Russians interfere in the American presidential election to defeat Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan getting the brunt of all these attacks from the Soviets but Reagan wasn't trying to undermine Walter Mondale Reagan wasn't trying to undermine his opponents by using the KGB but all of the Democrats seem to keep doing this is a running theme he told the Soviet ambassador to the US on atole Dobrynin it was in everyone's best interests if the Soviets would help the Democrats keep that demagogue Reagan from being reelected this is another theme that we're seeing so you have Tip O'Neill there we're working behind the scenes with our greatest geopolitical foe the greatest geopolitical foe the United States has ever had for the longest time it's ever had one and he's working behind the scenes saying we have to get rid of Reagan you need to help us subvert the American system to get rid of Reagan because he's a demagogue that's what you hear that you hear this all the time with Trump well we can subvert the Constitution we can subvert the constitutional order because you know he's a demagogue he's a demagogue these aren't normal times these are abnormal times we need to use abnormal means extraordinary times extraordinary meme we have to subvert our legal system to get rid of this guy because he's a demagogue fortunately Donald Trump just relied not on extraordinary means but on extraordinary memes to destroy Hillary Clinton and it works pretty well in 1996 Bill Clinton privately and off-the-record agreed to use the US government to interfere in the Russian presidential election backing boris yeltsin's reelection bid if Yeltsin cleared up a trade dispute that disproportionately affected Clinton's home state of Arkansas and more importantly than his home state of Arkansas but Clinton's main political donors from that home state of Arkansas so then finally you have Bill Clinton using the government to interfere in Russian elections to meddle in their elections as as the buzzword seems to be to get political favors not even for his country just for himself a few concluding points on this as we wrap up not just as we on this episode wrap up this Russian nonsense but as the country begins to wrap it up it seems that Muller's investigation is winding down the American left has never apologized for its support of the Soviet Union it's almost persistent support of the Soviet Union its help to the Soviet Union witting and unwilling in direct contact and in the proxy wars that we fought against one another during the Cold War they've never apologized they have to they have no credibility on Russia they shouldn't say peep on Russia they've been wrong about Russia for a century they don't get an opinion their opinion is not worth anything oh and when they accuse us of doing things we shouldn't listen to them we should laugh in their face and go on and continue sipping the delicious leftist tears the left has had a love affair with Soviet Russia since the beginning and for a couple reasons one because it was a communist state it was the leader of international communism on the other hand it wasn't America and the American Left hates its own country they hate their country and so the adversaries of their country become their friends they don't like American culture they don't like their countrymen they don't like America's policies around the world they live in the freest most just most prosperous most charitable country that has ever existed but they just seem unaware of that they don't like their country they shivers go up their spine when they see an American flag waving or a flag pin you heard Democrats for decade including Barack Obama saying I don't want to wear the flag pin I don't want to do this I'm a citizen of the world from all of the major leaders of American industry and all of the journalists we now hear I'm a citizen of the world I'm not a citizen of I don't have any pesky national ties that any of that pesky disgusting uncivilized patriotism that unsophisticated patriotism I'm a citizen of the world that's another reason why they persist in helping wittingly and unwillingly our adversaries today we know from the very beginning the major culture makers were communists in Hollywood we now make fun of McCarthyism and the house on American Affairs Committee but the guys were right there what maybe McCarthy didn't have a briefcase full of names but there were communists there were subversive figures in the State Department and obviously in Hollywood I don't think there were non subversive people in Hollywood I think all the non suppressive people in Hollywood are in this studio basically that this is amazing to me and people say oh that's just McCarthyism oh that's just you're hunting for communists well there were communists of course fine I mean maybe in some ways Joe McCarthy harmed his own cause because he was such an imperfect vessel of it he had so many personal flaws that in many ways he hurt anti-communism but the premise was right there were communists or communist throughout American institutions this is a classic example of projection from the left Trump's critics on the right say that he needs to come down harder on Russia they're saying well there I don't think there was Russian collusion he's come down really hard he needs sanctions he needs to come down hard on Russia no he doesn't no he doesn't to do that is to accept their ridiculous premise that Donald Trump the man we've known for four decades is a secret Manchurian Candidate of Moscow it's an absurd premise we don't need to give it the time of day we don't play defense we don't play defense for those jerks for those Russia loving communists loving jerks for a century we don't have to deal with their premises and respond to them as they want to be responded to no thank you Keep Calm and Kofi Fay move on ignore their nonsense it is so so rich lefties and Trump critics on the right are saying that Reagan would be ashamed if he saw these musicians about Russian Republicans cozying up to Russia Ronald Reagan would only be ashamed that we're so gullible that we're willing to buy it the left is accusing us the Democrats are accusing us of doing the very thing that they have been doing for a hundred years and we play defense we say no we're not it's ridiculous don't no you do not have to deal with them this way you do not have to accept their premises you do not have to play defense for even one second you don't know those people one single explanation on this point they owe you a hundred years of explanations and the next time they bring up Trump and Russia demand a hundred years of explanations from them demand explanations from Lincoln Steffens all the way up to the Barack Obama administration see what they say you'll at least have a long time to think of your retort because they'll have a century of explaining to do all right we've got to get to this day in history do we have to say goodbye to Facebook in YouTube yes we do that's awful this is a really good this day in history you seem a little fired up today I clearly have a little more confetti pumping through my veins we're gonna be talking about scalping we're going to have a defense of scalping and why why scalping is it is important for us as we look at this current political climate but if you are not on daily wirey calm you're not gonna be able to see it I want you to be able to see it we have we have some gory pictures they're not that gory but you know they're fun to watch if you're not unduly worried I can't do it if you are on Facebook please go to daily wire EECOM if you're on YouTube how did you find us on YouTube I don't know I've been trying to find us on YouTube for weeks now what I all I notice is they censor us and they promote CNN and The Young Turks and they fund the Young Turks but then they censor anything that I say because apparently a history of Americans Russian relations is too saucy for YouTube so there they can't you can't have any of that nasty little history getting out no no that would be too dangerous if Americans too learned anything about history so if you're on Facebook please come over what do you get it's $10 a month $100 for an annual membership you get me you get the inter Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get the conversation which annex will feature the big boss himself Ben you just flew out to DC to go to CPAC I'm very very envious I love going to see back if you're at CPAC right now have a good time it is super fun hopefully I'll be able to come Nick she or some of the time he didn't work but it is a lot of fun if you

those wonderful things at daily wire.com and you're gonna need this folks the left is tears tumblr you're especially gonna need it after I defend scalping in this damn history so make sure you go to daily wire comm we'll be right back okay let's do it this day in history on this day in history in 1725 Americans scalped a bunch of Indians not the most pleasant topic to talk about not the most pleasant event in American history but it is a surprisingly relevant one and that is it by the way basically just a group of New Hampshire colonists came across a band of Indians and they scalped ten of them and the colonists received a bounty of 100 pounds for a scalp from colonial authorities in Britain for those who don't know scalping is a native practice where you grab the the the Indians would grab the hair of their adversary and chop away at it in a semi-circle with some sharp device and then they would shake it loose and rip the top of the head right off of their enemies this wasn't the first time colonists adopted the grisly native practice though this was a major early example of it another major early example of cultural appropriation people didn't have as much trouble with the cultural appropriation at the time I'm sure the Indians didn't enjoy it very much but it wasn't such a cultural taboo as it is now now in the Americas Indians for millennia practiced this technique they used the sharp instrument they ripped the scalp right off of their victims scalping isn't fatal in itself though usually the only people who would stick around long enough to be scalped had already been inflicted with grave wounds or they were already dead so practically speaking it was fatal were it only related to dead people I promise you if someone's of sound mind and body and someone grabs your head with a little axe you're probably gonna run away pretty fast Americans and Europeans regularly referred to the Indians scalping knives you know you see this in a lot of literature the Indians had specific scalping knives but that isn't true the Indians just used regular old knives to scalp one day they'd go up to a colonist and scalp him and then they'd go home and eat their dinner and they'd used the same knife all the time there wasn't a specific a tool for that but the scalp of course became a war trophy so you'd come back with tent-like the colonists didn't they came back with ten scalps this is fairly fearsome and it's a trophy of your of your kill now Indians didn't just scalp combatants in the Americas the pawnees the shoe the sooo the Cheyenne they regularly scalped women and children this was considered by the way it wasn't considered dishonorable to scalp women and children it was considered especially honorable to scalp women and children because if you got the scalp of a woman or a little child or a baby that meant that you as a warrior had entered into the heart of enemy territory you didn't just grab one on the outskirts you went all the way in and chopped off these scalps of women and children now Indians practiced scalping in the Americas through the end of the 19th century this wasn't a long long time ago we're talking about a little over a hundred years ago 90% of scalped bar of dead bodies at the crow Creek Massacre site were scalped The Crow Creek Massacre site that's where a brutal brutal massacre took place among Indian tribes around the year 1325 we don't have a lot of records of this but sometimes seven or eight hundred years ago there was this major massacre and 90% almost all of the bodies were scalped other atrocities they're found at that site included tongue removal decapitation dismemberment based on standard Aboriginal butchering practices that were used on large game animals 1725 was not the first time that colonists scalped Indians there had been cases of colonists scalping Indians well back from this 17th century when they came to North America scalping by the way was not only practiced in the Americas it's not just that American Indians invented it Herodotus describes Scythian warriors scalping enemies in battle the Visigoths did it even as late as 1036 in England King Harold was apparently quite happy to scalp his enemies but after that barbaric practice fell out of fashion and civilized Europe it didn't fall out of fashion in other parts of the world why am I talking about this vicious grisly awful disgusting practice of scalping because we can take some lessons from it from modern political operations Saul Alinsky the Godfather of the modern left he rules for radicals he was a friend and mentor of Hillary Clinton he was admired by Barack Obama he was the patron saint the patron demon of community organizing in Chicago go he said that you need to make your enemies live up to their own book of rules so this is why you hear lefties all the time they say he that guy's such a hypocrite oh what a hypocrite you know when some Republicans senator who opposes the redefinition of marriage is caught having a little tryst with a fella in an airport bathroom they say see was such a hypocrite this point is meaningless because he's such a hypocrite because if the left didn't have double standards that have no standards at all the only they don't have it they don't have any principles of themselves so the only the only sin it according to the left is hypocrisy if you if you say that there's a standard and then fail to live up to it that's much worse in their minds than not having any standards at all which is which is what they practice and rush Foucault has a good line on this he says that hypocrisy is the tribute that Vice pays to virtue so I might say you know I want to give a lot of money to charity and then maybe I don't give a lot of money to charity or I take a little bit or I'm a little corrupt about it but that doesn't mean that it's wrong to give to charity and that's that's the virtue of the hypocrisy of not doing it it only highlights all the more the virtue of the thing that you failed to do this is the case in a lot of aspects of politics colonists in early America quickly learned that living up to their high polished European sophisticated standards was not going to work in a barren wilderness with hostile natives Carol Swain pointed this out yesterday we had Carol Swain on the law professor and political scientist she said I don't know if you caught this because she kind of buried it in one of her answers she said we should learn from the left and put into practice against them those tactics that we don't find morally repugnant we should read Saul Alinsky and all the things that we don't find morally repugnant we should do we shouldn't do the things that we find morally repugnant that would be becoming the left if we start if we compromise our own moral selves if we really compromise them and start being vicious and I don't know murdering babies or whatever it is they do that isn't good but the tactics that they use that we don't find morally repugnant we might find them aesthetically repugnant we might find them impolite we might find them not very nice not luxurious not befitting a nice salon with a glass of port or something like that but the ones that aren't morally repugnant that are only aesthetically repugnant we should take on we're finally beginning to see this on the right after losing the culture for decades and decades and decades were seeing this we're fighting back with humor we're fighting back with media savvy after being decimated by the media for decades and we're fighting in the culture we're not just saying we need to adjust this tax rate or adjust this this entitlement program a little bit what we're saying is we need to fight the culture because politics is downstream of culture and the way it's happening President khofifah is a great example of this he's a good avatar of this because he isn't pretty he isn't nice he isn't polished he isn't sophisticated doing these things that Carol Swain suggests we won't feel nice and polished we won't feel like we fit in at cocktail parties sipping Chardonnay but we don't always have the luxury of doing those things sometimes we need to fight hard we need to play hard not not immorally but hard especially against opponents that won't play by our more refined rules that's it I think that's I think that is the most that any person in politics is defended scalping in a few hundred years I hope that can be helpful we will be back tomorrow so make sure you come back there then get your
