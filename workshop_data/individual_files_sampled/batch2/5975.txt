is this memo basically the playbook for what Trump's defense is gonna be because again it was leaked to the New York Times Rudy Giuliani said Muller never responded to it and the New York Times who Trump seems to think is failing I hope not well because it's it's factually not very persuasive I don't think it's actually his defense to the charges although there's a lot of that in there what they're really trying to do here is argue as many defense lawyers do that he should not have to sit for an interview the problem is twofold one they rely on bad legal arguments and so that's on the one hand the second hand is once you start making factual arguments which they do hear a prosecutor reads those factual arguments that says gee thanks very much but I actually know more than you do so I'm gonna make my own conclusions about the facts here and here we are in June and this letter was sent in January and we're still talking about whether he's going to be interviewed so we can safely assume that Bob Muller and his team did not buy this argument okay congressman jolly I want to reread I mentioned in a moment ago what Giuliani told The Huffington Post I think it's extraordinary he said in no case can the president be subpoenaed or indicted no matter what it is he said that was even the case if he shot James Comey you tweeted yesterday there should be a much easier way to indict a sitting president they said look Giuliani is wrong but what you are seeing a couple things big picture clearly Donald Trump's attorneys think Bob Miller has the goods on him clearly there they are laying out everything if you are innocent you would simply your cooperate yes right so they are laying out a legal defense and from a legal defense perspective that's what that's what lawyers do and then the prosecutors get to respond I think politically though and and if there's any reassurance to people on this if the president United States is talking about pardoning himself about not being indicted you have to look at what the political environment would be what what political environment would be created by that we're really talking about the end of his presidency if you're talking about the president States saying I'm going to pardon myself even if Republicans started to protect him you're talking about the collapse in many ways of the institutions of this Republic so if we're at a moment where he's talking and actually acts on pardoning himself it is the end of his presidency okay congressman the president just tweeted the appointment of special counsel is totally unconstitutional despite that we play the game because I unlike the Democrats have done nothing wrong I want you to respond to this and please help me understand because you sit with them every day what are Republicans who are in Congress who we barely heard a peep out of sang about all this that's the key point and this is why I disagree with David a little bit who is an excellent tweeter who knew in high school right that it's going to be a life skill but look here's the point is they are pursuing the Nixon playbook and we're all looking at and saying why would you do that and the reason is because it's not Republicans in the Congress it's Republicans in the Senate and what they have concluded and here's where I agree with David is that they are gonna drag this thing out kick and scream run the clock as much as they can but what they're doing in the meantime he's maintaining the political base of support to say it's politics then the Nixon playbook is you might get impeached in the house because they think they're gonna lose it to us this fall but they can hold one third of the Senate and then they win and that is the difference between now and 1974 because then their own Republicans had some had some shame and they said it's wrong with the president's doing and we're going to impeach you sir you have to resign they don't think that's gonna happen this time and they might be right and that's what's terrifying is that that's why they float these outrageous scenarios flying in the face of everything we think we know about what is okay for a president to do because if they can hold one third of the Senate they're in office I think it's a brilliant move because if Republicans can run the clock here because if you ask Americans they care about the Muller investigation they believe it but what they care more when they go to vote is about taxes immigration jobs and if the economy chugs along could that get them through November and then they don't have to worry about sure Republican base voters care about this issue whatsoever in fact if if they care about it it's because they're defending their president and there's one thing that we have not yet seen among Republicans and it's almost the closing argument I was on the hill during the Clinton impeachment and one of the closing arguments by the Democrats David bonheur was the Minority Leader at the time the second Democrat in the House and he took to the House floor and he said look this is all about the special counsel trying to invalidate and take away what Democrats voted for to give us Bill Clinton and this is about them trying to rip away the presidency from us you're going to see Republicans make that final argument and when we get there we probably are on the heels of impeachment you're gonna say you're gonna see Republicans saying they're trying to take away our president but here's the point and if I can just put a finer point on it it is that it's the pump the problem for them is not impeachment it's it's it's being convicted in the Senate in other words I think they're building in impeachment what their what they're saying is is that you cannot get us out of office the way you couldn't get Bill Clinton out of office okay and that's the key because if you look at the data right now he has the highest approval among his own party of any president except George W Bush after 9/11 85 percent of Republican voters support him he cannot be in he cannot be convicted in the Senate if that stays true and all the rest of this is a dog and pony show and on sets like this we're going to impeach him 18 times but it won't matter even if it goes to the house if he can hold the Senate well I'm not an Adama which is a no pardon him shut it out right he should keep his mouth shut right now do what every client does and let the attorneys handle it when he when he flies off the handle on Twitter and sense of the world I can pardon myself he but that's a negotiation like every seasons I just think that's a negotiation like everything with Trump what he's doing is he's trying to soften them up to agree to some weak interview one thing to think about and you guys are the politicians but I'm curious about this too is right now Giuliani and Trump have the entire Stratus public stratosphere to themselves Bob mother is not saying anything at some point when we get to impeachment before we get to impeachment we are going to learn everything that Bob Muller knows and at that point that's when you wonder whether the poles start changing and whether the general you know views of the American public start to change because he's been silent all along it's a one-sided argument right now but I guarantee you that well if and when we get to impeachment it will no longer be one-sided and it will be strong and persuasive and damn Nate alright I want to stay on a Pietschmann because congressman Maloney you mentioned Bill Clinton our colleague Craig Melvin interviewed Bill Clinton yesterday and specifically asked about his brush with impeachment if you were president now in 2018 with with everything that's that's going on with the me2 movement how would you have approached the accusations differently well I don't think it would be an issue because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts if the facts are the same today I wouldn't a lot of the facts have been conveniently omitted to make the story work but I think partly because they're frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don't seem to care I think I did the right thing and defended the Constitution what do you make of that not as best interview those aren't those aren't those answers aren't good enough and I have a lot of respect for the former president I think he's right about one thing which is that which is that I'm not sure if the same level of tolerance for outrageous conduct in the presidency existed today he would have to resign either I do think that's not the standard some of us want you know maybe 20 years ago he was defending the Constitution I was there I was with him every day during that impeachment process it was a political trumped-up thing for sure he also had some real wrongdoing that he had to take accountability for he paid the hell of a price for it by the way he wasn't peached he was disbarred you know I mean there were real consequences to that that's absolutely the point and that's why you're right and and I think what what some of us hope is that now all these years later the credit to Craig moment for asking the tough questions that the president could have said yeah you know I should have said I'm sorry I'm sorry and and I and I can't say it enough that's all he had to say hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just
