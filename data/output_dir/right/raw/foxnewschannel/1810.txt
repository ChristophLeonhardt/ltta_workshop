00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:37,894
FRANCE BEFORE THIS HAPPEN, I

20
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:39,129

REGISTERING HIS COMPLAINT ABOUT

00:00:41,364 --> 00:00:42,899
THE PRESIDENT PULLING OUT OF THE

IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

25
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,768
AND THE MESSAGE FROM THE

26
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,102
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN WE'VE GOT TO

27
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:48,471
GET SERIOUS ABOUT IRAN NUCLEAR

28
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:50,473
THREAT, WE GOT TO GET SERIOUS

29
00:00:50,473 --> 00:00:52,275
ABOUT THE ISLAMIC TERROR THREAT

30
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:53,176
AROUND THE WORLD, AND JUST HOURS

31
00:00:53,176 --> 00:00:55,378
LATER, LOOK AT THIS, ALL OVER

32
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:55,678
AGAIN.

33
00:00:55,678 --> 00:00:57,881
>> HERE'S THE POINT, OF COURSE,

34
00:00:57,881 --> 00:01:01,084
THAT THE REGIME THERE IN TEHRAN,

35
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:04,754
WHICH HAS BEEN THERE SINCE 1979

36
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:06,289
IS AN EXTREME RADICAL JIHADIST

37
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:07,057
REGIME, AND THEY OF COURSE WANT

38
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:08,158
TO SPREAD THEIR IDEOLOGY, NOT

39
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:10,393
JUST TO THE MIDDLE EAST, BUT

40
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:12,862
ACROSS THE WHOLE WORLD.

41
00:01:12,862 --> 00:01:15,065
SO ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO

42
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:16,366
BRING THAT REGIME DOWN RATHER

43
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:18,568
THAN PROP IT UP MUST, IT SEEMS

44
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:20,870
TO ME, BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

45
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,173
ED: NIGEL, INSIDE FRANCE, THOUGH

46
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:24,474
YOU'VE GOT OVER 200 DEATHS AT

47
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:27,243
THE HANDS OF ISIS IN 2015.

48
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:28,812
WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE?

49
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:30,413
DO THEY HAVE THEIR HANDS AROUND

50
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:30,980
THIS AT ALL?

51
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,282
>> WELL, LOOK.

52
00:01:32,282 --> 00:01:33,516
THIS PARTICULAR ATTACK WAS

53
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:35,051
CONDUCTED BY SOMEBODY WHO CAME

54
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:38,788
TO FRANCE AS A CHILD REFUGEE, SO

55
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:41,024
THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO SAY

56
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:41,958
IS WHILST WE WANT TO BE

57
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:42,892
COMPASSIONATE HUMAN BEINGS, WE

58
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:44,494
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO WE

59
00:01:44,494 --> 00:01:46,629
GRANT REFUGEE STATUS TO, WHO WE

60
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:48,164
LET INTO OUR COUNTRIES.

61
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:50,066
BUT THE SECOND POINT, AND THE

62
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,334
REALLY IMPORTANT THING, IS HE

63
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:52,535
WAS ALREADY ON A SUSPECT LIST,

64
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:54,471
HE WAS ON A LIST OF SOMEBODY WHO

65
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:56,072
WAS A POTENTIAL DANGER TO THE

66
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:58,508
FRENCH STATE.

67
00:01:58,508 --> 00:01:59,809
AND HERE'S THE PROBLEM: THERE

68
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:03,179
ARE 40,000 PEOPLE IN FRANCE ON

69
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:05,048
THAT SUSPECTED TERRORIST OR

70
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:05,748
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS LIST.

71
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:08,818
SO FRANCE HAS A MASSIVE PROBLEM,

72
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:09,719
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU INCREASE AND

73
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,255
BOOST SECURITY, POLICING AND ALL

74
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:14,457
THE REST OF IT, HOW ON EARTH DO

75
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:17,260
YOU FOLLOW OR MONITOR 40,000

76
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:17,894
PEOPLE?

77
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:19,162
SO THE ONE THING WE CAN SAY WITH

78
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:20,363
ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IS WE WILL

79
00:02:20,363 --> 00:02:21,264
SEE MORE OF THESE ATTACKS

80
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:21,498
SEE MORE OF THESE ATTACKS.

81
00:02:21,498 --> 00:02:21,898
ABBY: YEAH.

82
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:22,966
AND IT'S NOT JUST IN FRANCE.

83
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:25,635
IT'S RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE AS WELL

84
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:25,902
IT'S RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE AS

85
00:02:25,902 --> 00:02:26,202
WELL.

86
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:26,970
IT'S RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY

87
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,303
AS WELL.

88
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:28,037
THE BRIDGE I'M LOOKING BEHIND

89
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:30,340
YOU HOW RECENTLY THAT ATTACK WAS

90
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:30,607
YOU HOW RECENTLY THAT ATTACK

91
00:02:30,607 --> 00:02:31,341
WAS.

92
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:32,876
AND THE KNIFE, THE STABBINGS

93
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:34,110
THAT HAVE GONE ON IN LONDON,

94
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,279
TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE AND THE

95
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:36,646
POLICIES.

96
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:37,247
>> YES.

97
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:38,748
LET'S DRAW A DISTINCTION HERE,

98
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:40,383
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN TERRORISM AND

99
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:41,751
THE KNIFE ATTACKS.

100
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:45,388
NOW, LONDON CRIME ITSELF, WHAT

101
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:46,623
WE'VE SEEN IS A 44% INCREASE

102
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:49,125
YEAR ON YEAR IN THE MURDER RATE

103
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,294
GOING ON IN THIS CAPITAL.

104
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:53,830
IT'S MOSTLY KNIFE CRIME.

105
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,698
IT'S MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH

106
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:55,999
GANGS.

107
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:57,300
IT IS MOSTLY BLACK ON BLACK

108
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,435
CRIME, ALTHOUGH NOBODY HAS GOT

109
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:00,670
THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AND SAY

110
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,206
THAT FOR FEAR OF BEING THOUGHT

111
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:04,774
TO BE RACIST.

112
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:06,376
AND OUR POLICE FORCE, WHICH USED

113
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:08,811
TO, IN AREAS OF HIGH CRIME,

114
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:10,713
CARRY OUT STOP AND SEARCH, IT

115
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:13,183
WOULD STOP PEOPLE, FRISK THEM

116
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:14,117
DOWN, SEE WHETHER THEY HAD

117
00:03:14,117 --> 00:03:15,385
KNIVES ON THEM.

118
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:16,686
UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE EVEN BACKED

119
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:18,188
AWAY FROM DOING THAT.

120
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:19,189
AGAIN, FOR FEAR OF BEING

121
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:21,291
CRITICIZED AS BEING RACIST.

122
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,194
AND THE MAYOR OF LONDON, SADIQ

123
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:26,629
KHAN, WHO SPENDS MUCH OF HIS

124
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:29,432
TIME ATTACKING DONALD TRUMP OR

125
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:32,268
TELLING US WE SHOULDN'T EAT

126
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:33,336
BURGERS AND OTHER POLITICALLY

127
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:34,437
CORRECT THINGS.

128
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:35,371
YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT THIS.

129
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:37,006
OVER 60 PEOPLE KILLED IN THIS

130
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:40,043
CAPITAL ALREADY THIS YEAR, AND

131
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:40,710
THE MAYOR OF LONDON HAS NOT

132
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,113
VISITED A SINGLE ONE OF THE

133
00:03:44,113 --> 00:03:45,682
CRIME SCENES AND HAS NOT SPOKEN

134
00:03:45,682 --> 00:03:46,282
TO ANY OF THE FAMILIES.

135
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:48,885
AND I THINK, FRANKLY, WHAT WE'VE

136
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:51,921
GOT TO DO HERE WITH CRIME IN

137
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:53,556
LONDON IS THE POLICE HAVE GOT TO

138
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:55,425
GET TOUGHER, AND THE MAYOR NEEDS

139
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:57,393
TO RETHINK HIS PRIORITIES.

140
00:03:57,393 --> 00:03:57,894
ED: YES.

141
00:03:57,894 --> 00:03:58,828
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS TWEET FROM

142
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:04,100
THE MAYOR TO YOUR POINT:  "CHILD

143
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,702
OBESITY, A PROBLEM IN LONDON IN

144
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:06,636
THE UNITED STATES.

145
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:07,370
LONDON HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST

146
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,007
OBESITY RATES IN EUROPE, 4% OF

147
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:13,810
CHILDREN AGE 10 AND OVER ARE

148
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,444
OVERWEIGHT.

149
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:16,946
AS PART OF A NEW STRATEGY WE'RE

150
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:20,649
BANNING HARMFUL JUNK FOOD ADS

151
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:21,451
FROM THE LONDON NETWORK."

152
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:22,885
>>NO MORE HAMBURGERS ON THE

153
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:23,219
SUBWAY.

154
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:24,153
ED: HE'S FOCUSING ON TRANSIT ADS

155
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:25,989
FOR JUNK FOOD, NOT ON THE

156
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:26,923
STABBING DEATHS?

157
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:28,191
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

158
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,759
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT IS

159
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,362
ABOUT PRIORITIES, AND, AS I SAY,

160
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:33,329
HE'S ALSO BUSY CRITICIZING

161
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:34,430
DONALD TRUMP AND SAYING HE'S NOT

162
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,665
WELCOME IN LONDON AND ALL THE

163
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:37,667
REST OF IT, BUT HE'S NOT -- YOU

164
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,135
KNOW, HE'S NOT GRIPPED IT.

165
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:40,136
AND AGAIN YOU SEE, ONE OF THE

166
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:43,172
PROBLEMS, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

167
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:46,009
THAT WE'VE HAD WITH ISLAMIC

168
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:46,976
TERRORISM IS THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY

169
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,578
BEEN FRIGHTENED OF DEALING WITH

170
00:04:48,578 --> 00:04:49,445
PROBLEMS WITHIN THESE

171
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:50,046
COMMUNITIES.

172
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:51,681
AGAIN, IT'S THIS FEAR THAT IF

173
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:53,516
YOU TACKLE A PROBLEM HEAD ON,

174
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:55,418
YOU GET CALLED RACIST FOR DOING

175
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:56,552
SO.

176
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:58,888
WE'VE GOT TO BURY THIS RUBBISH.

177
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:00,923
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING, ACTUALLY,

178
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:01,924
ON CRIME IN LONDON THE BEGOT

179
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:03,159
TOUGHER WITH THE OFFENDERS, IT'S

180
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:04,427
BLACK LIVES WE'D SAVE.

181
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:06,629
SO WE GOT TO CUT THIS NONSENSE,

182
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:07,964
CUT THIS OFFENSIVE, AND WE GOT

183
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:10,066
GET ON DOING THE JOB AND GIVING

184
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:11,401
THE POLICE REAL POWERS.
