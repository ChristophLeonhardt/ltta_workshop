WITH. IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE I DON'T GIVE A . CONGRESSMAN, THIS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME EFFORT ON YOUR PART TO GET TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT. I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE. OVER 500 PAGES. I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO READ IT ALL, BUT I WILL BEFORE MY SHOW TOMORROW NIGHT. YOUR TAKE, CONGRESSMAN? WHAT IT'S DONE, IT'S VINDICATED TRUMP ON BOTH PRONGS OF THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. YOU HAVE A DEMOCRAT INSPECTOR GENERAL SAYING COMEY SHOULD BE FIRED. I THAT SAID AND YOU BELIEVE THAT. THE IDEA YOU WILL HAVE AN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE TRUMP FIRED THE FBI DIRECTOR WHO THE IG ACKNOWLEDGED HAD NO BUSINESS BEING THE FBI DIRECTOR IS A FARCE. AND THIS SO-CALLED COLLUSION NARRATIVE, THEY DIDN'T GIVE THAT TEXT MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS WHEN WE ASKED WHERE STRZOK SAID WE WILL STOP TRUMP FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT. 6 DAYS EARLIER HE OPENED UP A COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION AGAINST TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN. THIS WHOLE THING IS AFFECTED WITH BIAS AND IT NEEDS TO STOP. CONGRESSMAN GATES, WITH RESPECT TO WHAT HE SAID, ONE OF THE DAMNING TEXT MESSAGES HAD TO DO WITH STRZOK SAYING DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE WILL STOP IT WHEN ASKED DO YOU THINK HE WILL EVER BE ELECTED PRESIDENT? THAT INFORMATION WAS NOT GIVEN TO CONGRESS. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DO ABOUT IT BESIDES GET ON A SHOW AND COMPLAIN ABOUT IT? FRANKLY, I THINK WE NEED TO IMPEACH ROB ROSENSTEIN. THESE TEXT MESSAGES THAT SHOWED THERE WAS AN EFFORT NOT ONLY TO REFLECT BIAS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT BUT TO MANIFEST THAT BIAS IN A WAY THAT IMPACTED PEOPLE'S OFFICIALACS AS GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES IS REPREHENSIBLE. THIS WAS BACKFIELD OUT. BLACKED OUT. IT WAS EMBARRASSING TO THE FBI THEY HAD SWAMP ALLIGATORS DOING EVERYTHING TO BE DESTRUCTIVE. WHAT IS FRUSTRATING WHEN THE VIEWERS WATCH THIS AND LAST NIGHT I WAS ON SEAN HANNITY'S SHOW WHEN HE WAS HOSTING. IT'S SO SAD. I ALWAYS BELIEVED IN THE SYSTEM. CAN AMERICANS BELIEVE IN THE FBI BASE UPON ON THE FACT IT SEEMS LONG-TERM DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE TO THE INSTITUTION? I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT. IT'S NOT JUST STRZOK AND PAGE. THERE WERE OTHER FBI AGENTS. ONE SAID AFTER TRUMP WON WHO WAS PART OF THE HILLARY INVESTIGATION AND PART OF THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, HE SAID, VIVA LARESISTANCE. THIS IS A GUY WORKING WITH MUELLER? GIVE ME A BREAK. YOU ALSO HAVE ALL OF THE LEAKING IN THE REPORT. SHOWING THE CASCADE OF LEAKS. YOU HAVE AGENTS GETTING GIFTS FROM REPORTERS. THERE ARE BROAD PROBLEMS IN THE HEADQUARTERS THERE. EVERYONE IS FRUSTRATED. WE KNOW IT'S WRONG. WE KNOW JOE WOULD BE IN JAIL. BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING. HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY. THE TEXT MESSAGE. EITHER ROB ROSENSTEIN KNEW THAT TEXT MESSAGE HAD NOT BEEN PRODUCED. IF THAT'S THE CASE HE NEEDS TO GO. OR HE WAS NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED. HE SHOULD GO. ALL RIGHT. AND CONGRESSMAN GATES, I HEARD EVERYBODY SAY ROSENSTEIN SHOULD BE GOING. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? WE NEED TO FILE ARTICLES OF IMPPEACHMENT. THIS IS THE SAME ROB ROSENSTEIN WHO SAID. WHEN? IMMEDIATELY. WHAT DO YOU NEED? 218 VOTES IN THE CONGRESS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AGAINST THE DEEP STATE THAT IS WORKING AGAINST OUR PRESIDENT TODAY. WHAT DOES PETER STRZOK STILL HAVE A JOB? STILL AN ALLIGATOR CRAWLING AROUND IN THE SWAMP OF WASHINGTON, D.C.? WE HAVE TO GET RID OF HIM. THE FACT WE HAVE NOT SHOWS A LOCK OF LEADERSHIP FOR THE FBI AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. HE MIGHT BE COOPERATING? BUT I SAY TO MYSELF, WHO IS HE COOPERATING WITH? EXACTLY. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT. I WOULD SAY YOU HOLD THESE PEOPLE IN CONTEMPT. IF THEY DON'T PRODUCE WHAT WE WANT YOU MOVE TO IMPEACH THEM AND REMOVE THEM FROM OFFICE. IF WE ARE NOT GOING TO USE THAT POWER, WE WILL HAVE THE SAME STUFF WHEN WE COME ON YOUR SHOW AND COMPLAIN AND DON'T GET ANY RESULTS. WE HAVE TO USE THE POWER WE HAVE. CONGRESSMAN, WHAT GATES JUST SAID WAS WE NEED OVER 200 VOTES FOR AN ACTUAL IMPEACHMENT OF ROSENSTEIN. EVERY TIME SOMETHING COMES OUT WE SAY THIS IS ANOTHER REASON TO IMPEACH HIM. IF YOU HAVE A SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE EXERCISING LEADERSHIP AND THE MAJORITY LEADER AND THEY SAY ROSENSTEIN HAS TO GO, THEY COULD MARSHALL THE SUPPORT OF THE CONGRESS. IT WOULD NOT COME TO AN IMPEACHMENT. WHEN YOU LOSE THE SUPPORT OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP IN A POSITION LIKE THAT, YOU CAN'T GO. IF WE PUT A RESOLUTION ON THE FLOOR SAYING ROSENSTEIN SHOULD GO AND THAT PASSED HE WOULD BE DONE. WE NEED PEOPLE TO EXERCISE LEADERSHIP. WHY ISN'T PAUL RYAN DOING THIS? HAVE HIM ON YOUR SHOW. I WILL CALL HIM TOMORROW NIGHT. FINAL QUESTION, IN TERMS OF THE FBI, DOUBLE THAT CHRISTOPHER WRAY WHO WATCHED THIS AND DIDN'T TAKE TAKE A WRECK WRAY WHO WATCHED THIS AND DIDN'T TAKE A WREC TAKE A DAEC TAKE A DAMA TAKE A DAMAGE TAKE A DAMAGE D TAKE A DAMAGE DON TAKE A DAMAGE DONE TAKE A DAMAGE DONE B TAKE A DAMAGE DONE BY TAKE A DAMAGE DONE BY CO TAKE A DAMAGE DONE BY COME TAKE A DAMAGE DONE BY COMEY. CHRISTOPHER WRAY NEEDS TO IMMEDIATELY FIRE PETER STRZOK AND TAKE SWIFTER ACTION. I BELIEVE CHRISTOPHER WRAY UNDERSTANDS HOW DAMAGING THE ACT OF THE ANTI-TRUMP PEOPLE WERE TO THE FBI. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DOCUMENTS THAT GET TO THE ROOT OF THIS. THE ROOT IS RUSSIA. THEY WANTED TO GET RID OF THE HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION. THEY WANTED TO LAUNCH A PHONEY RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. I DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN ANYBODY UNTIL THE DOCUMENTS ARE TURNED OVER. THE PROBLEM WITH NOT GETTING RID OF STRZOK, IF HE IS
