00:00:04,183 --> 00:00:09,188
SECRETARY HOGAN GIDLEY, DARRELL

00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:15,627
HUCK -- MIKE

4
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:17,162
HUCKABEE.

5
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:18,897
AS OUR PRESIDENT IS GETTING

6
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:21,900
CLOSE TO DOING SOMETHING IN

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,336
NORTH KOREA THAT NO OTHER

8
00:00:24,336 --> 00:00:26,738
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO.

9
00:00:26,738 --> 00:00:29,074
THERE ARE MANY IN THE MAINSTREAM

10
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:30,609
MEDIA WHO ARE ROOTING FOR HIM TO

11
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:31,043
FAIL.

12
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:34,313
HATE IS THEIR DAILY FARE.

13
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:36,949
THEY HATE HIM SO MUCH, THEY WANT

14
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:39,351
HIM TO FAIL.

15
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:40,452
PEACE BE DAMNED.

16
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:42,588
IF HE DOESN'T GET CREDIT FOR

17
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:44,289
BEING ONE OF THE SMARTEST, MOST

18
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:46,458
OF CLEVER AND SUCCESSFUL

19
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,327
NEGOTIATOR PRESIDENTS OF ALL

20
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:50,329
TIME, THEN WE'LL KNOW FOR SURE

21
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:51,964
WHAT IT'S ABOUT AND WHO THEY

22
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:52,231
ARE.

23
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:54,433
THEY ARE NOT JUST HATERS, AND

24
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:57,302
THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST

25
00:00:57,302 --> 00:00:57,836
POLITICS.

26
00:00:57,836 --> 00:01:00,372
THEY ARE ROOTING FOR AMERICA'S

27
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:03,842
FAILURE, AND THAT IS YOU BE

28
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:04,209
AMERICAN.

29
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,578
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEY REACTED

30
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:08,914
A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN THE

31
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:12,618
PRESIDENT SENT A LETTER TO THE

32
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:16,455
NORTH KOREAN LEADER CANCELING

33
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:17,723
THE SUMMIT.

34
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:20,859
HE BLIND SIDES HIS ALLIES, HE

35
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:21,727
DOESN'T CONSULT WITH CONGRESS.

36
00:01:21,727 --> 00:01:23,629
AS FAR AS WE KNOW HE DIDN'T

37
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:26,431
CONSULT WITH HIS OWN NATIONAL

38
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,300
SECURITY COUNCIL.

39
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,502
HE DICTATES THIS BIZARRE

40
00:01:30,502 --> 00:01:31,036
EMBARRASSING LETTER.

41
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:33,505
>> IT WAS ALWAYS HARD TO BELIEVE

42
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:35,240
DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE THE FIRST

43
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,576
AMERICAN PRESIDENT EVER TO MEET

44
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:39,244
A DICTATOR OF NORTH KOREA.

45
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:41,813
THE EFFORT TO BRING THAT ABOUT

46
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:44,349
HAS BEEN DISORGANIZED AND NONS

47
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:45,250
SENSICAL FROM THE START.

48
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,186
>> THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM TURNED

49
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:51,556
OUT TO BE AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM.

50
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:56,261
PRESIDENT TRUMP CANCELED THE

51
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:58,664
SUMMIT ACCORDING TO NBC NEWS HE

52
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:02,567
WAS AFRAID THEY WERE GOING TO

53
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,136
CANCEL AND HE WANTED TO BEAT

54
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:06,505
THEM TO IT.

55
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:08,907
JUDGE JEANINE: WE GET THREE

56
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:10,776
AMERICAN HOSTAGES BACK, THE

57
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:12,477
PRESIDENT HASN'T LIFTED ANY

58
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:15,113
SANCTIONS, AND IS PREPARED TIME

59
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:17,115
POSE NEW DEBILITATING ECONOMIC

60
00:02:17,115 --> 00:02:18,884
SANCTIONS PENDING THE OUTCOME OF

61
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:20,285
THE SUMMIT.

62
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:22,187
COMPARE THIS TO OUR LAST FAILURE

63
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:24,456
OF A PRESIDENT WHO SENT LOVE

64
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:26,758
LETTERS TO THE AYATOLLAH BEGGING

65
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:29,394
IRAN TO COME BACK, THEN PAID

66
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:32,230
THEM OFF WITH TONS OF CASH AND

67
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:39,771
USE OHS ON PALETTES IN UNMARKED

68
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:40,305
PLANES.

69
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:43,475
HOW DOES ONE  * REACT WHEN THE

70
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:45,577
PRESIDENT PULLS OUT OF THE SUM?

71
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:47,045
IT HE CRAWLED BACK IN FRONT OF

72
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:50,949
THE WORLD AND ASKS THE SUMMIT TO

73
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:58,090
BE BACK ON.

74
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,292
THE THEY HAVE BEEN BUILDING UP

75
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:03,128
NUCLEAR WEAPONS SINCE BUILT

76
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:06,164
CLINTON DAYS WHEN HE WANTED TO

77
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:10,168
GIVE KIM JONG-UN WADS OF CASH.

78
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:13,672
AND WHEN HE PARADED AROUND

79
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:17,542
BUILDING ICBMs WHEN OBAMA WAS

80
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:18,777
PRESIDENT, THEY DID NOTHING,

81
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:21,380
NOTHING THAT MATTERS.

82
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,549
AS THIS PRESIDENT OPENLY

83
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,184
NEGOTIATES FOR THE SAFETY AND

84
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:29,521
SECURITY OF THIS NATION, EVEN

85
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:36,128
HAS OUR MILITARY STRENGTH AND

86
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:37,462
ANNOY LATE ISIS.

87
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:43,168
THIS IS THE COVER OF "THE

88
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:43,568
ECONOMIST."

89
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:46,104
THE WRECKING BALL THE PRESIDENT

90
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:52,744
IS SWING ON IS THE PLANET.

91
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:54,613
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER TWEETED

92
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:56,381
THIS.

93
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:59,851
WITH ICBMs AND NUCLEAR

94
00:03:59,851 --> 00:04:01,286
WARHEADS IN THE HANDS OF NORTH

95
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:04,122
KOREA, THE SITUATION IS FAR TOO

96
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:08,126
DANGEROUS FOR SEAT OF THE PANTS

97
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:08,894
NEGOTIATING.

98
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:13,165
CHUCK, IT WAS YOUR PARTY THAT

99
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:13,932
SECURITY THIS UP.

100
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:16,134
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH WORK

101
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:19,370
HAS BEEN DONE.

102
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,704
YOU SIMPLY CAN'T CONNELL

103
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:24,276
PREBEHIND THE JEAN -- YOU CAN'T

104
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:26,378
COMPREHEND THE GENIUS OF DONALD

105
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:29,114
TRUMP UNLESS YOU WERE LOOK FOR A

106
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:32,217
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION.

107
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:34,419
BUT THAT WAS BACK THEN.

108
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,122
YOU CAN'T COMPREHEND MIKE

109
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:37,489
POMPEO.

110
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:40,258
OUR PRESIDENT HAS NO FEAR.

111
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:42,427
ACCORDING TO PRESIDENT ABE OF

112
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:44,529
JAPAN WHO SAID IT BEST.

113
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:47,032
A MAJOR STEP FORWARD BUSINESS TO

114
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:48,733
BE TAKEN.

115
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:49,501
PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU ARE ABOUT

116
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:53,672
TO MAKE A NEW HISTORY.

117
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:55,474
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS

118
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:56,942
STRONGLY LOOKING FORWARD FOR THE

119
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:59,711
UNITED STATES-NORTH KOREAN

120
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:02,981
SUMMIT TO OPEN DOORS TOWARD

121
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:05,350
PEACE AND STABILITY OF THE

122
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,585
NORTHEAST I YEAH.

123
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:09,121
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN LIBERALS

124
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:11,223
WERE GENEROUS SOULS FIGHTING FOR

125
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:13,225
THE COMMON MAN TO ASSURE HIS

126
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:14,259
SUCCESS AND SAFETY.

127
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:16,161
BUT NOW THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED

128
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:16,895
IN SUCCESS.

129
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:19,397
THEY ARE JUST ANGRY.

130
00:05:19,397 --> 00:05:22,134
IN FACT, THEY ARE FURIOUS.

131
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:25,170
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO

132
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,038
STEAMROLLS THE ECONOMY TO

133
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:29,040
HISTORIC HEIGHTS.

134
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,543
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AT AN

135
00:05:31,543 --> 00:05:32,010
18-YEAR HIGH.

136
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,312
TAX CUTS FOR EVERYONE.

137
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:36,748
AND UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOT JUST

138
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:38,583
DOWN, THERE ARE ACTUALLY MORE

139
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,052
JOBS THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE TO

140
00:05:41,052 --> 00:05:42,687
FILL THEM.

141
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:44,890
DID YOU HEAR WAY JUST SAID?

142
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,491
MORE JOBS AVAILABLE THAN THERE

143
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:49,027
ARE PEOPLE TO FILL THEM.

144
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:50,262
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT IS

145
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:52,497
AT ITS LOWEST IN THE HISTORY OF

146
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:53,698
THIS COUNTRY.

147
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,467
AND THEN THE SAME WITH

148
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:55,901
HISPANICS.

149
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:57,936
OUR BUSINESSES WILL BE ABLE TO

150
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:01,206
COMPETE AGAIN AS WE GET OUR MOJO

151
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:04,209
BACK ON THE WORLD STAGE.

152
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:06,511
TAKE A LOOK AGENT THESE PICTURES

153
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:08,813
FROM THE G-7.

154
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:10,482
OUR PRESIDENT TONIGHT MIDDLE OF

155
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:11,283
EVERY PHOTO.

156
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:13,552
THE MAN IS CENTER STAGE.

157
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:15,554
WORLD LEADERS ARE ALL OVER HIM.

158
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:17,222
THE QUESTIONS ARE TO HIM.

159
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:19,925
HE IS DOMINATING THE G-7.

160
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,927
AMERICA IS BACK, FOLKS.

161
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:26,331
THE TRUTH, HOWEVER, IS A FAR CRY

162
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:29,067
FROM WHAT STUMBLING NANCY SAID

163
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,469
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO.

164
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:34,439
>> THIS TAKES PREPARATION.

165
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,540
THIS TAKES KNOWLEDGE.

166
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,075
THIS TAKES JUDGMENT.

167
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:39,611
AND CLEARLY IT TAKES PREPARATION

168
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:41,613
WHICH THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T MAKE.

169
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:42,948
IT'S CLEAR HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

170
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:45,350
HE WAS GETTING INTO.

171
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,918
JUDGE JEANINE: SWEETHEART, AS

172
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:48,587
THE PRESIDENT SAID HIMSELF, HE

173
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:50,555
HAS BEEN PREPARING FOR HIS HIS

174
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:51,756
WHOLE LIFE.

175
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,525
AND NOT PREPARED?

176
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:55,560
YOU CAN'T BEGIN TO COMPREHEND

177
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,529
THE SUCCESS AND BENEFITS WE'LL

178
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:59,831
REAP FROM THE MEETING WE HAVE

179
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:01,533
BEEN WAITING A LIFETIME FOR.

180
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:04,803
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN AMERICA

181
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:06,438
CELEBRATED SUCCESSES TOGETHER.

182
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:09,608
WE WE CAME OUT WITH OUR KIDS ON

183
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:11,676
THE STREETS WITH PARADES, WAVING

184
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:13,878
OUR FLAGS AND TEACHING OUR

185
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:15,547
CHILDREN THE IMPORTANCE OF

186
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:16,314
PATRIOTISM.

187
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:18,216
DONALD TRUMP IS BRINGING AMERICA

188
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:20,518
BACK IN FRONT OUR EYES.

189
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:22,287
AND IT'S TIME FOR THE

190
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:25,423
