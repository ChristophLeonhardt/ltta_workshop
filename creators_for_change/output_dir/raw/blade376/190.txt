00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the charts in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube at</font>

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,529
the most discussed it makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder</font>

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,720
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> does discussed actually mean</font>

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,610
because let's face it when I see people

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,160
post comments on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube videos I always</font>

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">see it as a bi-directional form of</font>

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,299
communication and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not multi-directional</font>

8
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,640
so what do I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were you</font>

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,590
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> my video right now you're going</font>

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,050
to post a comment and I might reply but

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,180
how well do you know these people that

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,250
are watching this video<font color="#E5E5E5"> alongside you</font>

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,750
perhaps I've called this wrong and you

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,310
actually know everyone very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well but I</font>

15
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,289
highly doubt that I guess a comparison

16
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,880
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point is a teacher in a</font>

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,250
classroom they will talk about something

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,050
which is provocative and then a member

19
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,879
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the class will speak their mind but</font>

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,469
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the teacher will say well</font>

21
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's have a class discussion and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

22
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,920
children would speak among themselves

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,510
and they'll actually gained a lot more

24
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,129
out of the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience so therefore</font>

25
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm just putting it out to you in this</font>
