IN THE ELECTION.
>>> THIS MEMORIAL DAY WE
REMEMBER THOSE WHO MADE THE
ULTIMATE SACRIFICE FOR OUR
COUNTRY.
TRAVIS WAS KILLED BY AN
TRAVIS WAS KILLED WY AN
TRAVIS WAS KILLED WHIAN
TRAVIS WAS KILLED WHILE SAVING
HIS GROUP.
>> HERE PRESIDENT OF TRAVIS
MANYAN FOUNDATION.
REMINDED OUR AUDIENCE WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT AND HOWP YOU HOPE THEY
SPEND THIS HOLIDAY.
>> YES.
FOR US, I HOPE THAT EVERYBODY
SPENDS IT WITH FAMILY AND
I HOPE THAT EVERYBODY HAS AN
ENJOYABLE WEEKEND.
I ALWAYS SAY THAT I HOPE THAT
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY TAKE
A FEW MINUTES TO RECOGNIZE WHAT
MEMORIAL DAY SIGNIFY TO THIS
COUNTRY AND THAT WE ARE ENJOYING
OURSELVES BECAUSE OF THE
SACRIFICES THAT THESE MEN AND
WOMEN MADE.
>> TELL US WHY RYAN WAS SO
SPECIAL TO YOU AND EVERYBODY.
>> HE WAS MY BROTHER AND BEST
FRIEND.
BUT TRAVIS SAID SOMETHING BEFORE
LEAVING FOR HIS SECONDDY
EMPLOYMENT TO IRAQ.
AND MY HUSBAND ASKED HIM WHY HE
HAD TO GO BACK AND HE SAID FIVE
WORDS, IT'S NOT ME, THEN WHO.
AND THOSE FIVE WORDS HAVE BECOME
A MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT THIS
ENTIRE COUNTRY.
AND I THINK IT RESONATES.
NOT JUST WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN
WHO SERVE, THEY'RE ALL EXAMPLES
OF THIS IDEA OF LIVING THIS
IDEAL BUT ALSO BEING ABLE TO
PASS IT DOWN TO THE NEXT
GENERATION.
>> THE FOUNDATION PARTICIPATED
IN A LOT OF RACES AND HONORED TO
BE A PART OF HAS HAD A CHARACTER
STRENGTHENING PROGRAM.
CHARACTER DOES MATTER.
TELL US WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH
THAT.
>> REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO
DO WITH THE FOUNDATION IS UNITE
COMMUNITIES BY STRENGTHENING OUR
NATIONAL CHARACTER.
AND WE BELIEVE THAT MEN AND
WOMEN WHO SERVE ARE THE CATALYST
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
WE GO OUT AND TRAIN VETERANS AND
FAMILIES OF THE FALLEN TO
DELIVER CHARACTER EDUCATION TO
OUR NATION'S YOUTH.
>> AND IN THAT PROGRAM, LET ME
GET THE NUMBERS OUT, LAST YEAR
YOU WORKED WITH 40,000 YOUTH?
>> SLOWTLY,
>> ALOWTLY,
>> ABSWTLY,
>> ABSOLLY,
>> ABSOLUT,
>> ABSOLUTELY.
55% OF THEM WERE AT-RISK YOUTH.
THEY ARE THE CATALYST TO
CHANGING THE CHARACTERSHIP NP
OUR COUNTRY.
>> YOUR DAD HAS WRITTEN AN
AMAZING BOOK ABOUT TRAVIS' LIFE.
IT IS AN AMAZING STORY.
YOU SEE PHOTOS OF HIM AND HE'S
SO FULL OF LIFE.
HE SEEMED SO HAPPY AND HONORED
TO BE SERVING THIS COUNTRY.
IF HE WERE HERE TODAY, WHAT
MESSAGE WOULD HE GIVE THE
MILITARY, THOSE WHO ARE IN THE
POSITION THAT HE WAS THAT ARE
SERVING.
>> I THINK WHEN I TALK ABOUT
BRENDON AND TRAVIS AND WHAT THEY
REPRESENT.
TO ME, TRAVIS WAS MY BROTHER,
BRENDAN WAS MY FRIEND, THEY WERE
BEST FRIENDS, AMAZING
INDIVIDUALS.
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THEY
REPRESENT THIS GENERATION OF MEN
AND WOMEN WHO HAVE STEPPED UP TO
SELFLESSLY SERVE.
TO THANK THEIR NAME AND USE THEM
AS AN EXAMPLE TO REPRESENT ALL
OF THE MEN AND WOMEN IS THE WAY
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO BRIDGE
THE DIVIDE, MAKE SURE THAT
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE SERVICE
AND THE SACRIFICE OF THESE MEN
AND WOMEN.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S COOL
ABOUT THE FOUNDATION IS YOU'RE
GOING RIGHT AT THE HEART OF THE
BIG ISSUES WITH OUR COUNTRY BUT
DOING IT WITH EVERY INDIVIDUAL
AT A TIME.
IF OUR SCHOOLS AREN'T DOING IT,
YOU'RE SAYING WE BETTER TRAIN
VETS AND MILITARY FAMILY MEMBER
TO DO IT AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING AFTER.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
NOT ONLY THAT BUT THEY WANT TO
DO IT
THE VETERANS ARE RETURNING AND
THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO GIVE
BACK.
THEY'RE TAKING OFF THE UNIFORM
BUT THEY'RE NOT NOT READY TO
SERVE.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE
GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY.
>> THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU FAMILY
HAS DONE FOR THIS NATION AND
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY.
>> AND YOU'RE ATORNADOABLE.
