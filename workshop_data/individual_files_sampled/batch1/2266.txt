axis doesn't mean a damn thing Ted let me ask you a question sure is every American entitled that I underlined that word to healthcare as a right of being an American yes no you know I'm glad you asked that you know right is a word you use a lot you know what the Declaration of Independence said we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness so what is a right is access to health care what is a right is choosing your own doctor and if you believe health care's are right why on earth did you help right Obamacare that cost six million people to have their health insurance canceled that had them lose their doctors and have people like LaRhonda who can't get health insurance can't afford for you scarred you're denying her what you say is her right well two things you didn't answer of course although I interpret your questioning to be the LaRhonda does not have a right now that's not what care is access but your doctor so Ron do you have access right now go out get a really great health insurance program oh you can't do it because you can't afford it all right that's what he's saying access to what you want to buy what of Donald Trump's mansions you have access to do that as well oh you can't afford five million dollars for ours sorry access doesn't mean a damn thing what it means is whether people can afford it can get the health care that they need and they can't say Obama care sack of the wall let's some people have problems no question about am i logging with you on that said but don't argue with me when I tell you that twenty million more people did get health insurance all right
