1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE
HAS DEALT WITH A NUMBER OF

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,649
OBSTACLES, PROTESTERS,
REGULATIONS, PEOPLE WHO DO

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,000
NOT WANT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE
PIPELINE TO CONTINUE.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,190
AS YOU CAN REMEMBER AT THE END
OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,150
THE TRANS CANADA WHICH IS THE
COMPANY, THE CORPORATION BEHIND

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,420
THE KEYSTONE NEXTEL PIPELINE DID
EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,290
GET OBAMA TO APPROVE THE PERMITS
TO FURTHER CONSTRUCTION.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,699
OBAMA SAID NO, TRUMP COMES IN
AND SAYS YES, YOU CAN

9
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:30,480
CONTINUE WITH CONSTRUCTION AND
NOW IT TURNS OUT, DUE TO

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,210
SIMPLE ECONOMICS, YOU MIGHT NOT
EVEN HAPPEN.

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,080
THEY MIGHT EVEN BUILD THE REST
OF THE PIPELINE.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,100
LIMIT ME THE DETAILS ON THIS.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,240
THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT
FOR TRANS CANADA HAD A CALL

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,580
WITH INVESTORS AND HE IS LIKE
YO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,510
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE PRICE
OF OIL IS PRETTY LOW,

16
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,770
PRODUCING OIL IS PRETTY HIGH.

17
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,680
MAYBE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
TOGETHER WITH THIS PROJECT

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,710
AFTER ALL.

19
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,380
LOW OIL PRICES AND THE HIGH COST
OF EXTRACTING CANADIAN CRUDE

20
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,540
FROM OIL SANDS ARE CASTING NEW
DOUBTS ON KEYSTONE XL AS

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,190
EXECUTIVES WITH THE CANADIAN
COMPANY THAT WANTS TO BUILD

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,650
A FACE THE FINAL REGULAR
REGULATORY HURDLE NEXT WEEK

23
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,650
IN NEBRASKA.

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,510
KEEP IN MIND THAT NEBRASKA'S
ONLY STATE THAT HAS AN

25
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,710
APPROVED IT JUST YET, AND THAT
IS BECAUSE THE FARMERS IN

26
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,500
THE STATE THAT ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT THEIR CROPS.

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,360
THE PIPELINE WOULD ESSENTIALLY
GO TO THEIR PROPERTY AND IT

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,580
COULD BE DAMAGING FOR THEIR
BUSINESS, FOR THEIR

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,530
AGRICULTURE AND SO TRANS CANADA,
AND A TRANSCANADA EXECUTIVE

30
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,320
RAISED EYEBROWS IN THE INDUSTRY
LAST WEEK

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,890
WHEN HE SUGGESTED THAT THE
PIPELINE DEVELOPER DOESN'T

32
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,920
KNOW WHETHER IT WILL MOVE
FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT.

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,090
PAUL MILLER, AND EXECUTIVE VICE
PRESIDENT WHO IS EVERYTHING

34
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,050
THE PROJECT, TOLD AN INVESTOR
CALL THE COMPANY OFFICIALS

35
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,200
WILL DECIDE UNTIL LATE NOVEMBER
OR EARLY DECEMBER WHETHER

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,940
TO START CONSTRUCTION.

37
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,530
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW
MUCH THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE

38
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,750
THEY BEGAN CONSTRUCTION, CRUDE
OIL WAS TRADING AT AROUND $49.50

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,410
A BARREL ON WEDNESDAY THIS WEEK,
AND THAT IS DOWN FROM THE

40
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,470
HIGHS OF MORE THAN $100 IN 2014.

41
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,549
AGAIN, PRICES HAS DIPPED
CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR LIKE

42
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,229
WE DON'T KNOW THAT UP ANYMORE.

43
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,229
MARCUS?

44
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,260
HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM PREMARKET
QUEST OF THIS IS REPORT FOR

45
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,990
A NUMBER OF REASONS.

46
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,470
PERSONAS IMMEDIATE ISSUE.

47
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,780
THE CRUDE OIL THAT COMES
FROM CANADA IS THE MOST

48
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,340
EXPENSIVE KIND OF OIL TO
EXTRACT.

49
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,130
THEY BEGAN THESE PROJECTS WHEN
OIL PRICES WERE REALLY HIGH

50
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,800
AND WHEN OIL PRICES ARE REALLY
HIGH THEN IT IS WORTH GOING

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,780
THROUGH THAT EXPENSE TO EXTRACT
IT.

52
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,770
IS ALSO SOME OF THE DIRTIEST
FOSSIL FUEL THERE IS ON THE

53
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,770
PLANET.

54
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,310
THERE IS MORE CARBON THAT GOES
IN THE AIR BECAUSE OF THIS TYPE

55
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,740
OF OIL THAT IS IN CANADA.

56
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,290
IT IS
NOT THE ONLY PLACE IT IS IN

57
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,300
BUT CANADA HAS A HUGE RESERVOIR
OF IT.

58
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,420
SO IF OIL PRICES ARE HIGH THEN
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A HUGE

59
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,440
ECONOMIC INCENTIVE.

60
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,160
WHICH IS MAKE UP NUMBERS TO KEEP
IT SIMPLE THOUGHT IT COST YOU

61
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,569
50 BUCKS TO GET THE OIL OUT OF
THE GROUND, BUT THE OIL IS

62
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,720
TRADING AT 100 BUCKS, EVEN
WITH THE TRANSPORTATION AND

63
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,209
DISTRIBUTION AND ALL THAT STUFF,
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE

64
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,290
A HEALTHY PROFIT MARGIN.

65
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,400
BUT IS NOW ALL THE SUDDEN THE
PRICES ARE $50, THAT IS THE

66
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,270
PRICE TO EXTRACTED.

67
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,290
IT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO MAKE ANYMORE.

68
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,739
TO GO FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT.

69
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,349
ONE OF THE REASONS OIL PRICES
ARE GOING DOWN IS BECAUSE

70
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,320
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER SOURCES
OF ENERGY NOW WHICH DIDN'T

71
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,720
EXIST AND WE HAD INCREDIBLY HIGH
OIL PRICES EARLIER ON.

72
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,599
SOME OF WHICH EXISTED BUT WERE
AT A MUCH LOWER LEVEL.

73
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,270
SOME ARE GROWING EXPONENTIALLY
NOW.

74
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,830
KEEPING IT REAL, IT IS NOT JUST
RENEWABLE ENERGY.

75
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,319
FRACKING IS KILLING OIL.

76
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:41,180
FRACKING IS A REALLY INTERESTING
TOPIC AND IT HAS BIG UPSIDES,

77
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,630
BUT POTENTIALLY MUCH BIGGER
DOWNSIDES BUT ONE OF THE UPSIDES

78
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,480
IS THAT AT LEAST IT BRINGS DOWN
THE PRICE BECAUSE THERE IS MORE

79
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:56,019
SUPPLY FOR REAL ECONOMIST, YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT SUPPLY AND

80
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:59,510
DEMAND IS UNLIKE RICK PERRY WHO
THINKS SUPPLY AND DEMAND

81
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,480
WORKS, IF YOU MORE SUPPLY YOU
HAVE MORE DEMAND.

82
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,970
THAT SOMEHOW WORKS AT ALL.

83
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,840
THIS IS ALSO GREAT NEWS FOR THE
FUTURE ON A BIGGER SCALE BECAUSE

84
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,850
FRACKING HAS A LOT OF DOWNSIDES
BUT RENEWABLE ENERGY DOES NOT

85
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,419
HAVE VERY MANY DOWNSIDES AND IT
IS ALSO GROWING EXPONENTIALLY.

86
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:26,979
WHEN IT DOES, IT BECOMES CHEAPER
TO MAKE BECAUSE YOU HAVE

87
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:30,949
ADVANTAGES IN TECHNOLOGY THAT
YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT

88
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:33,890
YOU HAVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE YOU
COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AND SO

89
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,629
THE BIGGER RENEWABLE ENERGY
GETS, THE LOWER ITS COST IS AND

90
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,780
THAT IT COMPETES WITH OIL AND
THERE IS A CERTAIN POINT AT

91
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:50,520
WHICH EXTRACTING CRUDE OIL NO
LOVING OR MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE.

92
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,680
THIS IS HOW A FREE MARKET IS
SUPPOSED TO WORK.

93
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,530
WHERE YOU HAVE COMPETITION FROM
COMPETING INDUSTRIES, COMPETING

94
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,009
SOURCE OF ENERGY AND YOU DON'T
HAVE THE OIL INDUSTRY OR THE

95
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:06,210
COAL INDUSTRY OR ANY INDUSTRY
HAVING A MONOPOLY ON THE

96
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,389
WAY ENERGY IS PRODUCED IN THE
UNITED STATES BECAUSE THAT

97
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,759
IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT IS BEEN
HAPPENING FOR VERY LONG OF TIME.

98
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,889
YOU HAVE LOBBYISTS WORKING FOR
BIG OIL, WORKING WITH

99
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:19,840
POLITICIANS, FUNDING POLITICIANS
IN ORDER TO PREVENT ANY TYPE OF

100
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,550
INVESTMENT TOWARD RENEWABLE
ENERGY OTHER ENERGY.

101
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,699
WE'VE HAD CRONY CAPITALISM IN
THIS REGARD FOR A VERY LONG

102
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,789
TIME AND IT IS NICE TO SEE THAT
EVEN THOUGH WE STILL HAVE

103
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,930
CRONY CAPITALISM, THERE ARE
FORCES THAT ARE FIGHTING

104
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,639
AGAINST IT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN
DEFEAT SOME OF THE DIRTIER

105
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,360
FORMS OF ENERGY THAT WE ARE
REDUCING.

106
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,400
AND YOU GUYS SAY LOOK, WHY
DON'T YOU JUST LET THE FREE

107
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
MARKET DECIDE.

108
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,850
DO COAL COME ALL THIS STUFF AND
THEN MAYBE YOUR RENEWABLE

109
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,810
ENERGY WILL WIN OUT IN THE END.

110
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,409
IS LIVING OUT RIGHT NOW, BUT
THERE ARE ALSO COSTS YOU

111
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,449
ARE NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT.

112
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:00,599
WHEN THEY TAKE THE FOSSIL FUELS
OUT OF THE GROUND, THEY DON'T

113
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:04,629
PAY THE COST OF THE COMMON THAT
GOES INTO THE SKY AND THE CARBON

114
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,430
IN THE AIR IS A COST THAT IS
PAID BY ALL OF US.

115
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,749
WHEN YOU GET TO PRIVATIZE THE
GAINS AND SOCIALIZE THE LOSSES?

116
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,970
THAT IS NOT FREE MARKET EITHER.

117
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,559
IT IS PERFECTLY RATIONAL TO SAY
THAT IN TERMS OF THE CARBON COST

118
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:25,680
OF THIS CRUDE OIL IS NOT WORTH
IT TO CANADA, THE CITIZENS

119
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,990
OF CANADA OR AMERICA THE WORLD
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO

120
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,469
THAT I'M WE'RE GOING TO SAY IT'S
OKAY BECAUSE RENEWABLE ENERGY

121
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:34,659
IS GOING TO COME UP ANYWAY AND
IT TURNS OUT WE WERE RIGHT.

122
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,270
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO THIS KIND OF
FOSSIL FUEL.

123
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,280
ALL IT DID WAS HURT THE PLANET
AND THEY NEVER PROPERLY

124
00:06:39,280 --> 00:00:00,000
PAID FOR ITS COST.
