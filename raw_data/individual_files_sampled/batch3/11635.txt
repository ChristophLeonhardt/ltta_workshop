Donald Trump's latest speech to the military in the US has stirred the imagination of sci-fi fans he's announced a new frontier for America outer space on this special space force to go with it but as Artie's haneish Isetta explains while some had a field day with theme jokes on the Internet others are warning of the dangers of space militarization the Army Navy and Air Forces aren't enough in the battle for world dominance it's time for new developments and Donald Trump isn't short of ideas space is a war fighting domain just like the land air and sea we may even have a space force develop another one space force we have the air force while the space force we have the army the Navy trans comments have captured the imagination of Twitter users with many wondering whether he'll become the guardian of the galaxy or will he be training an army of Power Rangers or storm troopers ready to fire lasers at any extraterrestrial threats even some of the president's general seem to be on the same page or planets there is no war in space just as there is no war in cyberspace there is only war and war can extend into any domain not a new idea it's been proposed many times in the past and it's always been rejected but it is something that people have been promoting again recently I think that would be a very negative move actually because it would create a constituency whose natural interest then is to further the weaponization of space and create a greater danger of actual war in space but not although both the u.s. defense and air force secretaries have labeled the space plan as a necessary bureaucratic and costly and their house in fact been a space command for over thirty years as part of the US Air Force and carries out intelligence operations and make sure space isn't militarized then there's also the 1967 Outer Space Treaty no small obstacle to any American ambitions to put weapons in orbit it was created to stop the setup of military bases in out of space and address other cosmic concerns although the US has previously blocked or abstained from the UN efforts to regulate space weapons since at least the past 20 years if not beyond that the United States has had no interest in any discussion of space arms control say although it's hard to tell how sincere Trump is at this point one thing is for sure Trump feels the force is with him
