recently many of you may have heard journalists and commentators using the expression deep state you may have heard them say the deep state is threatening our democracy or the deep state is conspiring against the President or help help agents of the deep state are coming to and then a high-pitched scream followed by a horrific gurgling noise and an ominous silence you may have found yourself asking what is the deep state you may have then found yourself vanishing off the face of the earth leaving nothing but a pair of eyeglasses a gold tooth and a trail of blood well today I'd like to explain to you the meaning of the term deep state the deep state is that group of influential people in bureaucratic agencies intelligence services and the military who tend to remain in positions of power no matter who gets elected the deep state is not a conspiracy in the sense of faceless evildoers gathering in secret locations to thwart any threat against their interests most of them do have faces although they like to hang back in the shadows making their faces difficult to see mostly however they simply go about the business of making regulations gathering information and arranging the mysterious deaths of anyone who opposes them now we all need government regulations and intelligence but the deep state can get out of control during the Obama administration for instance there were so many new and restrictive regulations that they increased our energy and medical costs hampered small businesses reduced internet innovation and ultimately cost taxpayers a stupendous hundred billion dollars every year here's how it works let's say Congress constitutionally passes a clean water law making it illegal to dump toxic chemicals into public waterways the Environmental Protection Agency then issues a regulation declaring your toilet a public waterway and forbidding you to go to the bathroom for the rest of your life if you sue the EPA because you need to use the bathroom the courts will cite the Chevron rule which says only the pa can decide if the EPA is violating the rules of the EPA if you say wait what that's crazy then videos of your online sex with a 16 year old girl named starlight who's really a 47 year old fat man named Schlomo will inexplicably turn up on HBO if you cancel your HBO in protest you could then be fined $100,000 a day until the fine reaches 14 million dollars or you disappear without a trace whichever comes first leftists and the media but I repeat myself tend to love the deep state because it empowers elites like themselves to outlaw the life choices of all those annoying We the People types in the flyover States therefore if a president comes into office who threatens to oppose the deep state that deep state may retaliate by leaking his secrets to a compliant press who will then spin them into hysterical conspiracy theories allowing intelligence agencies to tangle him in useless investigations fortunately I can tell you that that can't happen here I can't tell you that it can happen here because then I'd be killed trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right well this is probably the last Andrew Clavin chosen though just my shoes will be left after I attack the deep state so here's what I want to talk about today I want to talk about we were talking about yesterday Trump's attack on the culture and how important I think that is and how I think he's really doing a good thing even though there sometimes this conflict between what he says and what he does I mean yesterday was a great Trump day Trump had a terrific day made a great appointment we'll talk about all that but whenever I go out I very rarely go out and give speeches and the reason for that is I'm a writer I write at my desk if I have to leave my desk it cost me time it cost me money it cost me production so I don't like to do it unless they pay me thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars which they never do for some reason but whenever I do go out and give a speech especially if I'm giving a speech about the culture I always begin it with three quotes and the quotes of these one is from Percy by Shelley who is one of the great Romantic poets the great British Romantic poets he wrote poets are the unacknowledged ledges legislators of the world so Shelley was writing when poetry was the best-selling form of fiction you know you know if you wanted to be a famous person you would probably write poetry the Sir Walter Scott had best-selling poems Byron was the most famous literary figure of the time so he's saying poets and the unacknowledged legislators of the world they write the laws though nobody knows it poets write the laws James Joyce was a novelist at the time when novelists were the best-selling form of fiction they were just giving way to the movies and he wrote in a novel about a novelist thing about it called portrait of the artist as a young man and at the end the young man Stephen Daedalus has this revelation where he realizes he's going to go off and become a novelist and he says I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race and what he's saying is an artist I go and I like encounter reality and I turn it in the factory of my soul I turn it into the things that form my races conscience and my racist consciousness so he again is saying that artists form people's consciousness and the final quote is a quote I don't know where it comes from but my friend Andrew Breitbart used to say it all the time he used to love to say politics is downstream of culture meaning that by the time you get in to the voting booth your mind has been shaped by a thousand pieces of information flowing into your head art the movies that you watch the stories that you read the stories that are being told the sentiments that are expressed all around you and these become a form of thinking so powerful that you don't even know they've shaped you you don't even know they've shaped you the example I always give is George Washington the father of American liberty who could not understand why his slaves didn't work hard he couldn't understand why they would escape why they would want to be free it took him a long time to figure that out because the narrative around him was so powerfully accepting of slavery that he couldn't see it and that's why I think what Donald Trump is doing is actually kind of history-making and amazing and and positive you know there's there's politics I see everything in these two kind of catchment areas there's politics so we can take you know this decision and that decision say yes this is good we like this this is bad you know he's gonna do things I think he has certain left-wing tendencies he's probably gonna do things I don't like and I'll say that you know I don't like that policy but what he's doing in the culture weirdly enough I think is the most important thing he has done so far that thing he did with that press conference which he followed up with a speech in Florida it it changed everything it changed everything these guys were crawling all over him like the Lilliputians over Gulliver they were tying him down with nonsense about the Russian conspiracy and look hey later if it turns out they get some facts about a Russian conspiracy I'll say hey they had it they got the story but they don't have the story now and that hasn't stopped them from running front page stories trying to imply the Trump is somehow indebted to the Russians that he's somehow working with the Russians but what is really happening when you look at what's really happening it is a very different story before we get to news.the the McCalister appointment and all this stuff let's just go back and look at the speech that he made in Florida after after this press conference where he hammered this home talking about the press and going directly to the people this is the first Trump cut the dishonest media which has published one full story after another with no sources even though they pretend they have them they make them up in many cases they just don't want to report the truth and they've been calling us wrong now for two years they don't get it but they're starting to get it I can tell you that they've become a big part of the problem they are part of the corrupt system Thomas Jefferson Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out often times on their lives when the media lies to people I will never ever let them get away with it I will do whatever I can that they don't get they have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda now I'm a First Amendment absolutists short of crying fire in a crowded theater I believe that everybody should be able to say anything there should be no restriction on the press don't forget don't forget it was Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and the Democrats who wanted to shut down the press who wanted to stop david bossy from putting out his film against against hillary clinton who are complaining about the spending which remember money in the political arena is speech so Donald Trump has done exactly diddly nothing to restrict speech or spy on reporters which Barack Obama also did he has done nothing to hold up foi a Freedom of Information Act requests he may do that later but he hasn't done it yet all he has done is struck back and that is revolutionary because he's a Republican and because you know you notice you notice Congress is doing absolutely nothing why because they're so afraid of the press that they're hiding under the desks so the thing is the thing is this of course scribes the press crazy because it's never happened to them before they've never gotten a slap they so richly deserve and I wanted to put in a cut Reince Priebus and chris wallace going at each other because chris wallace is an honest guy he's an honest reporter he works for Fox News there's no way you can say he's part of the left-wing conspiracy but but the media is so left-wing it's so left-wing that even an honest man becomes a sort of tool of the dishonesty so here he is fighting with write-ins Priebus as previous explains why they don't like the covered but you get about ten percent coverage unaffected yet a very successful meeting with Bibi Netanyahu the the Prime Minister of the UK the Prime Minister of Canada covered all the hospitals conferences everybody dead right sure yeah for about yeah right but then as soon as it was over the next twenty hours is all about Russian spies but you don't want to tell us what to do nothing's happening you don't get to tell us what to do anymore than Barack Obama did Rock Barack Obama whined about Fox News all the time but I gotta say he never said that we were an enemy of the people let me tell you something he said a lot of things about Fox News Chris I think you ought to go check the tape he blamed you for a lot of things and I'm surprised that someone from Fox that you'd forget all the shots that he took no and we didn't like it and frankly we don't like this either because you know he'd but he never went as far as president Trump has and that's what's concerning because it seems like he crosses a line when he talks about that were an enemy of the people see it's just not true Obama went far far beyond that I didn't like the phrase enemy of the people either although I think truth to it with our news media but that I didn't like that line but that doesn't matter I mean Obama went so much further in you know subpoenaing phone records and trying to criminalize James Rosen's job you know trying to say that he had committed essentially committed treason they were awful the Obama administration was awful all this guy has done is struck back and when Chris Wallace says you don't get to tell us what to do like a two-year-old child that doesn't mean a thing nobody's telling him what to do all he's telling him was what he has done all Priebus is saying is what you've done he's not saying what he has done what he has to do he's saying what he's done now and let me show you why let me I just want to show you why this is so that the thing about the media is it's not this story it's not that story it's an entire atmosphere as Trump himself said it's a tone okay do you we've talked a lot about how all this stuff about all this nonsense about Russia they forget about the fact that Barack Obama leaned over to the Russian president and told him to send a less a the outgoing Russian president told him to send a message to Vladimir Putin the incoming Russian president that after the final his final election Obama said I'll have a lot more flexibility and he was referring to missile defenses to stopping the missile defenses from being arrayed in Europe okay serious serious stuff I mean I'm not calling it treason but it was that was a serious serious thing to do nothing like the Trump administration has been found out to have done nothing anywhere close to this here is MSNBC's Katie tor who is on Twitter all the time talking about how reporters are like firemen they run to a story like a fireman runs to the fire here's Katie tor interviewing Florida congressman Frances Rooney and Rooney brings this up listen to Katie's reaction you seem to have a lot of confidence so that he is going to treat Russia in as tough away as his predecessors did I do and I think you'll treat it I'm just wondering where that comes from well he's got a lot of conservative people in the government and and you know he's a business guy so he might have spoken a little less nuanced than very trained generals and State Department leaders might but I think he knows that as he said all through the campaign we're going to keep America strong we're going to keep America safe both the both at home and abroad and you can't do that without dealing with Russia he also has a number of people that were at least in his administration until last week who were friendly with Russia General Mike Flynn being one of them his former campaign CEO was Paul Manafort who's got ties to Russia his Secretary of State was given them medal of friendship by Russia so you say there's a lot of conservatives who are going to push back in Russia but I see a lot of folks within Donald Trump's administration who have a friendlier view of Russia that maybe past administrations dead well I think it was Obama that leaned over to Putin and said I'll have a little more flexibility to give you what you want after the reelection I'm sorry I don't know what you're referring to congressman she could have said it was not Putin who was medvisit be dead you did but but it was the former guy but he said to send the message to boonies ah yes I tell Vladimir I will pass this on to Vladimir that you will give over Europe to our clutches you know I have no idea what you're talking about congressman that is the problem that's this thing the Obama administration it was scandal-free it was scandal-free this is the problem and it's because the the left and then that means the media that because the media is ensconced in its own narrative they don't even know they're lying even guys like Chris Wallace are defending a dishonest organ of information because he doesn't know they are stuck in the narrative and so up until now have we been stuck into the in the narrative and Trump has really started to shatter that I think it is a positive thing in and of itself with this his appointments with the judge the pick for the Supreme Court with his rearranging our relationships with Israel I think it is a positive good in and of itself I'm gonna talk about some of the dangers I think he's facing but you got to come over to the Daily wire calm and hear that if you're listening on facebook or youtube
