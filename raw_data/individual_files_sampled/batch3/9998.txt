THEIR FUTURE HAS IN STORE. ERIC: THANKS SO MUCH. A LOT OF ANTICIPATION. ARTHEL: JOINING ME ON ALL OF HIS IS JOHN PARK. DR. PARK, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE. I WANT TO JUMP RIGHT IN. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS NORTH KOREA'S STRATEGY. AND IS KIM JONG-UN TO BE TRUSTED THAT HE'LL OPERATE IN GOOD FAITH? WE ARE LOOKING AT THE TRANSPORTATION OF THE TOTALITY OF THE NORTH KOREAN LEADERSHIP RE ZWREEM SINGAPORE. THIS ISN'T JUST PURELY FOR THE OPTICS ASPECT OF IT. THIS IS A BIG PART OF THE POTENTIAL LAUNCH OF A PROCESS THAT COULD LEAD TO A LOT OF DETAILS THAT COULD LEAD TO THE END OF A KOREAN WAR. WHAT WOULD A DENUCLEARIZATION PROCESS LOOK LIKE. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS. THERE IS DEEP DISTRUST ON BOTH SIDES. BUT THESE TWO LEADERS ARE CLEARLY UNCONVENTIONAL BY THE STANDARD OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES. SO THERE IS A STREAMLINED APPROACH FOR THESE TWO LEADERS TO ENGAGE TO LAUNCH THIS PROCESS GOING FORWARD. ARTHEL: PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE THAN A PHOTO-OP. WHAT SHOULD PRESIDENT TRUMP SAY TO KIM JONG-UN IN THIS MEETING. A LOT OF THE THINGS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SAID. WE HAVE SEEN A UNIQUE ARRAY OF PERSONNEL. WE ARE NOW POTENTIALLY SEEING THE BEGINNING OF A ROBUST PROCESS GOING FORWARD. THERE WILL BE A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS IN THAT PROCESS. BUT AS THE UNDER CASE OF THE FORD MOVEMENT. SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO IS A CRITICAL PLAYER. WE HAVE HAD CUNNING *'S MAIN ADVISOR KIM YONG CHOL IN THE WHITE HOUSE. ARTHEL: THERE IS A LOT OF GROUND WORK COVERED. SHOULD THE U.S. STAND STEADFAST, DENUCLEARIZATION OR BUST? THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT MOVING PIECES. THERE IS A COMPONENT THAT IN MANY RESPECTS THE LARGER GAME PLAN IS THIS IDEA HOW DO WE LINK THE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS. THE SOUTH KOREANS HAVE HAD THEIR BIG SUMMIT. THEY LAID OUT A DECLARATION. THE BIG PART ABOUT MOVING FORD, DEVELOPING AN ECONOMY, THE EARLY LISTING WILL BE DONE BY SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA. BUT IN ORDER TO GET THERE, THERE HAS TO BE PROGRESS ON THE DENUCLEARIZATION PIECE. ARTHEL: IS THAT A YES. IS IT DENUCLEARIZATION OR BUST OR NOT? IT WILL BE A KEY COMPONENT. BUT THE MANAGING OF THE EXPECTATIONS IS WHO DOES WHAT WHEN AND HOW. IT'S THE CORE ELEMENT BUT IT'S HOW IT'S DONE THAT IS THE BASIS OF HOW WE SEE THE FORWARD MOVEMENT. THEY WILL WERE PRESIDENT TRUMP RELYING ON HIS GUT IN RELYING ON HIS GUT DN RELYING ON HIS GUT D GUT INSTINCTS. ' HE SAID HE CAN READ KIM JONG-UN WITHIN A MINUTE OF MEETING HIM. IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE FOOTAGE. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BEFORE JUST A FEW MONTHS, HE WAS AN ENIGMA. WE HAD SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO MEET WITH KIM JONG-UN. PREVIOUS AMERICAN SIT EVEN WHO MET WITH KIM JONG-UN WAS DENNIS RODMAN. BUT HE'S VERY MEASURES IN HIS MEETINGS. WITH THE WORDS AND DIALOGUE ON THE NORTH KOREAN SIDE WILL BE MEASURED. ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SIDE THE ENGAGE, CAN I MAKE THE DEALS GOING FORWARD. AND IT'S NO EASY FEAT. IT'S THIS IDEA IN STARTING THIS THERE WILL BE A LOT OF CONTENTIOUS ISSUES COMING UP ALONG THE WAY. ARTHEL: HOW KEY ARE THEY? YOU HAVE TWO LARGER THAN LIFE PLAYERS. YOU LAID OUT THE ROAD LEADING UP TO THIS IN TERMS OF THE GROUND WORK TAKING PLACE. WHAT ABOUT THESE TWO LEADERS THEMSELVES. DOES THE BUCK STOP WITH THEM? IT LOOKS LIKE WITH THE TWO STRUCTURES WE ARE SEEING A STREAMLINING OF PROCESSES THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S THE CASE. IT'S UNPRECEDENTED HOW WE HAVE SOONER THE TOP-DOWN APPROACH. THE TWO LEADERS AGREED TOP MOVE FORWARD AND DELEGATED KEY INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. MIDDLE LEVEL WORKING GROUPS, THEN YOU ESCALATE HIGHER UP AS YOU SEE MORE PROGRESS. THEY ARE YOU NEXT SENSE THIS IS HAVE MUCH ABOUT DEAL MAKING. THE IDEA OF THE TRADITIONAL MODEL IN THE WAY NEGOTIATIONS HAVE COMMON THE PAST, THEY FACTOR IN. IT'S VERY SPECIFICALLY ON THESE INDIVIDUALS AND HOW THEY SEE THE PATH AHEAD. ARTHEL: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ROLES PLAYED BY DIFFERENT NATIONS. I LIKE TO DESCRIBE AS PRESIDENT MOON SCRAPED OFF THE PLAQUE OFF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS. IF YOU RECALL THE HE VERNLTS JUST BEFORE THE DECLARATION, WE SAW DIPLOMATIC BREAKTHROUGHS. THE USE OF THE WINTER OLYMPICS IN SOUTH KOREA WAS THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS. BUT PRESIDENT MOON ON THE SOUTH KOREAN SIDE TOOK THE EARLY RISK. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SOUTH KOREAN ROLE, THEY WILL SEEK TO CLOSE GAPS. WHEN THERE WAS AN EARLY GAP BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CHAIRMAN KIM, PRESIDENT MOON DID A LOT TO TRY TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS. AND HE HAS THAT UNIQUE ROLE TOP PLAY GOING FORWARD. ARTHEL: WHAT ABOUT CHINA AND RUSSIA AND JAPAN. EVEN SOME OF THE HIGH-PROFILE EVENTS WE HAVE SEEN HAVE BECOME BACKGROUND NOISE. KIM JONG-UN HAS MET WITH XI JINPING TWICE NOW. IT'S REMARKABLE THE HELP THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING FROM THE CHINESE SIDE. KIM JONG-UN ARRIVED IN SINGAPORE ON A CHINESE AIRCRAFT. THERE IS A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT THE SUPPORT COMING FROM THE CHINESE SIDE. RUSSIA IS STILL IN THE BACKGROUND. THIS IDEA OF TRYING TO ESTABLISH A DIRECT CONNECTION. CHAIRMAN KIM HASN'T MET WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN YET. PRIME MINISTER ABE IS TRYING TO GET THAT KIND OF CONNECTION. IF WE SEE THE BROADER MOVEMENT IN THESE MECHANISMS THERE COULD BE A STATE. BUT GETTING THE DENUCLEARIZATION PROCESS UNDER WAY WOULD CREATE THE SPACE FOR OTHER MECHANISMS UNDER WAY. WE ARE PUTTING A LOT OF FOCUS ON THIS MEETING IN SINGAPORE. ARTHEL: AS REPRESENTED IN THIS PHOTO POSTED BY GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL'S CAMP. THERE WAS CLEARLY SOME CONTENTIOUS MOMENTS. NOW YOU HAVE THIS TWITTER FEUD WITH CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. DOES THIS AFFECT LEVERAGE ON THE LEVEL GOING INTO THE SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG-UN? IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE U.S. TEAM TO MAKE THAT DIFFERENTIATION. THERE IS ALSO SOME ISSUES IN BETWEEN THE BILATERAL RIPS BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE RESPECTED EUROPEAN LEADERS. BUT THIS ALL NEW. IN ONE SENSE THE COMPARISON IS MULTI LADD LATERAL. AND THIS IDEA HE'S IN CONTROL. IN THAT DYNAMIC IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHIFT THE FOCUS AND APPRECIATE THIS IS A DIFFERENT SETTING. THEY WILL THERE ARE EVERYONE IS HOPEFUL FOR A POSITIVE OUTCOME. WHERE ARE THE CONSEQUENTIAL PITFALLS? IN NORTH KOREA'S FIELD, IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES DOING DIFFERENT THINGS. BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR. I THINK THIS IDEA OF A JOINT LAYING OUT THE KEY GOALS OF THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES HERE, THE UNITED STATES LOOK AT REDUCING THIS THREAT FROM THE NORTH KOREANS AND MOVING FORD WITH DENUCLEARIZATION. THE POTENTIAL ELIMINATION OF A POLICY AND SECURITY GUARANTEE WOULD LEAD TO THE BASIS OF THE OFFICIAL LAUNCH. THESE ARE THE AREAS A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE. RATHER THAN GOING TO THE TABLE AND NEGOTIATING FROM SCRATCH, THIS IDEA OF REVIEWING WHAT HAS BEEN PEAF CHEEFD UP UNTIL NOW AND MAKING THIS DECISION OF THE OFFICIAL LAUNCH OF THE DENUCLEARIZATION PROCESS. ARTHEL: I WANT TO ASK YOU, WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE CONSIDERED REAL 60s EXPECTATIONS COMING OUT OF THIS MEETING? WE HAVE SEEN THE MANAGING EXPECTATIONS. BUT THE REALISTIC STEPS FORD, I CAN APPROACH IT FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE. A LOT HAS BEEN DONE BELOW THE SURFACE. WE'LL SEE MORE OF IT AFTER THE SUMMIT. BUT THE FACT IT'S BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR A WHILE. THAT'S A PIECE OF IT I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEAT ANNOUNCEMENT OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MORE OR LESS AGREED TO. ARTHEL: WE ARE GOING TO CALL
