if you if you look at look at things over a broad span of time the things that that are less important kind of fall away and if you look at things from the broadest possible span of time as it relates to life itself primitive life things started around 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago and what are the important steps in the evolution of life and obviously there was the advent of single celled life there was a differentiation to plants and animals there was life going from the oceans to land was mammals consciousness and I would argue also on that scale should fit life becoming multiplanetary and in fact I think consciousness it is it's the next step actually because you really kind of need consciousness to design vehicles that can transport life over hundreds of millions of miles of irradiated space to an environment that they did not evolve to exist in there it would be very convenient of course if there was another planet just like Earth nearby but but that's unlikely and and as it turns out not the case I think if one could make a reasonable argument that something is important enough to fit on the scale of evolution then it's important and may be worth a little bit of our resources you
