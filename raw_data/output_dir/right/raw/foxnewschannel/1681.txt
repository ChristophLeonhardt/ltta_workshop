1
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:08,204
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

2
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:09,505
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE UNITED

3
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:10,540
STATES CAPITOL RIGHT NOW.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,642
A LOT OF PEOPLE ANTICIPATING

5
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:13,743
THAT AFTER NOVEMBER, THAT COULD

6
00:00:13,743 --> 00:00:15,878
BE LOOKING LIKE A VERY DIFFERENT

7
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:17,113
PLACE, THAT THIS BLUE WAVE THAT

8
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:19,415
EVERYBODY ENVISIONS COMING IS

9
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:21,217
GOING TO MEAN DEMOCRATS WILL AT

10
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:22,685
LEAST CONTROL THE HOUSE OF

11
00:00:22,685 --> 00:00:23,152
REPRESENTATIVES.

12
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:24,453
THEY'RE GUNNING FOR THE SENATE

13
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:25,521
AS WELL.

14
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:27,857
THAT MIGHT BE A DICEYER MOVE.

15
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:29,659
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DEMOCRATIC

16
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:30,893
CAUCUS, A NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN,

17
00:00:30,893 --> 00:00:31,994
JOE CROWLEY.

18
00:00:31,994 --> 00:00:33,396
CONGRESSMAN, VERY GOOD TO HAVE

19
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:33,663
YOU.

20
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:34,197
>> THANKS, NEIL.

21
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:35,364
GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.

22
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:37,900
>> Neil: I REMEMBER LAST TIME WE

23
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,669
CHATTED, YOU TAKE NOTHING FOR

24
00:00:39,669 --> 00:00:41,137
GRANTED.

25
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,905
SHOULD TAKE THINGS FOR GRANTED

26
00:00:42,905 --> 00:00:47,877
BUT MANY INSIST A BLUE WAVE IS

27
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:48,511
COMING.

28
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,413
THAT IS A CONSENSUS.

29
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:52,715
DO YOU THINK THAT'S JUSTIFIED?

30
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:55,051
>> WELL, I'D MUCH RATHER BEEN IN

31
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:57,019
OPPOSITION THAN THE MAJORITY'S

32
00:00:57,019 --> 00:00:57,386
POSITION.

33
00:00:57,386 --> 00:01:00,656
I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE POISED TO

34
00:01:00,656 --> 00:01:02,391
WIN BACK THE HOUSE.

35
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:05,428
IT'S ABOUT THE MESSAGE.

36
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:06,562
PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW THAT

37
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:08,197
DEMOCRATS OFFER A BETTER DEAL.

38
00:01:08,197 --> 00:01:10,166
BETTER JOBS, BETTER WAGES AND A

39
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:10,766
BETTER FUTURE.

40
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:13,236
THAT'S WHY WE'LL BE SUCCESSFUL

41
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:13,869
IN NOVEMBER.

42
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:15,338
>> Neil: I NOTICE MANY OF THE

43
00:01:15,338 --> 00:01:17,340
REPUBLICANS THAT WON,

44
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,507
CONGRESSMAN, HAVE BEEN MAKING

45
00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:20,610
NANCY PELOSI THE ISSUE OR

46
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,379
COMMENTS ON CRUMBS WHEN IT COMES

47
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:27,450
TO TAX CUTS, YOU KNOW, REPEALING

48
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,718
THOSE TAX CUTS IF THE DEMOCRATS

49
00:01:28,718 --> 00:01:29,552
GOT BACK IN.

50
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:32,355
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?

51
00:01:32,355 --> 00:01:34,657
>> MY THOUGHTS ARE -- I HAVE

52
00:01:34,657 --> 00:01:35,825
VERY STRONG THOUGHTS ON THAT.

53
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:37,026
THE REPUBLICANS ARE BANKRUPT

54
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:38,761
WHEN IT COMES TO IDEAS.

55
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,830
RUNNING AGAINST NANCY PELOSI AND

56
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,198
THESE DISTRICTS IS JUST FALLING

57
00:01:42,198 --> 00:01:42,498
FLAT.

58
00:01:42,498 --> 00:01:44,600
IT'S NOT HAVING THE EFFECT THAT

59
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:46,202
I DO THINK THAT THE REPUBLICANS

60
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:48,271
NEED TO FOCUS ON IDEAS ABOUT HOW

61
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:49,505
THEY'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE

62
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:50,439
LIVES OF AMERICANS.

63
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,608
I'M NOT HERE TO GIVE THEM ADVICE

64
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:53,876
QUITE FRANKLY.

65
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:55,711
I'D RATHER THEN GO ON THEIR OWN

66
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,679
RECORD --

67
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:58,047
>> Neil: BUT THEY HAVE COME UP

68
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:00,483
WITH IDEAS, CONGRESSMAN.

69
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:02,451
THEIR TAX CUT IS WORKING.

70
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:04,253
THE ECONOMY IS PROVING.

71
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:05,488
SENTIMENTS SURVEYED SEEMS TO

72
00:02:05,488 --> 00:02:06,622
INDEPENDENT CASE THAT.

73
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:09,458
OTHERS SAID WE HIT A CEILING.

74
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,526
WE MAY BE RIGHT.

75
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:12,461
THE PRESIDENT'S POLL NUMBERS ARE

76
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:13,162
TICKING UP.

77
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:15,731
DO YOU WORRY WHEN YOU SEE THAT?

78
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:17,099
>> I'M SKEPTICAL HOW WELL THE

79
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,534
TAX BILL IS PLAYING IN TERMS OF

80
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:19,902
THE REPUBLICANS GAME PLAN.

81
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:21,470
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

82
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,606
>> Neil: ARE YOU FOR REPEALING

83
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:23,873
IT?

84
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:26,609
>> I AM FOR ADDRESSING THE

85
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:28,978
OUTSTANDING ISSUES LIKE SALT

86
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:30,146
PROVISIONS THAT HURT NEW YORK,

87
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:31,380
NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA, WHICH

88
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,616
IS A POLITICAL ONSLAUGHT ON BLUE

89
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:36,986
STATES, WHICH IS REPREHENSIBLE.

90
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:39,722
>> Neil: VALID CRITICISM --

91
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:40,690
SOUNDS LIKE NANCY PELOSI SAID

92
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,358
REASON THE WHOLE THING UP.

93
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:45,027
>> WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES

94
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:45,928
IN IT.

95
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:47,963
NOT EVERY PROVISION IS BAD.

96
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:49,799
I DON'T THINK CORPORATIONS WERE

97
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,033
EXPECTING A 21% RATE.

98
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:52,535
I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD GET

99
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:53,436
BELOW 25%.

100
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:55,538
THERE'S THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO

101
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:58,040
MAKE IT MORE FOCUSED ON THE

102
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,108
MIDDLE CLOSE --

103
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:00,476
>> Neil: WOULD YOU RAISE THE

104
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:02,278
CORPORATE RATE FROM THE 21% --

105
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:03,546
>> I THINK THAT IS ONE AFTER

106
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:04,680
THAT WE CAN LOOK AT.

107
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,882
WE CAN LOOK AT THE FACT THAT

108
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:08,684
THEY LOWERED THE MARGINAL RATE

109
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:13,989
FROM THE WEALTHIEST FROM 39% TO

110
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:14,256
37%.

111
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:16,025
WE CAN ADDRESS TAX REFORM AND AT

112
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:17,727
THE SAME TIME ADDRESS ISSUES OF

113
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:20,062
THE NEEDS OF WORKING PEOPLE IN

114
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:21,664
OUR COUNTRY.

115
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:24,100
LARGELY -- IT WAS FORGOTTEN IN

116
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,035
THIS PARTICULAR BILL.

117
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:27,670
>> Neil: IF DEMOCRATS DID TAKE

118
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,871
OVER, CONGRESSMAN, YOU THINK

119
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:30,306
IT'S TIME FOR NEW LEADERSHIP,

120
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:33,175
THAT THE LEADERSHIP IN THERE IS

121
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:34,343
TOO OLD?

122
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:37,613
>> I THINK THAT OUR CAUCUS IS

123
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:38,681
FULL OF WISDOM.

124
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:39,281
NANCY PELOSI --

125
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:41,050
>> Neil: YOU'RE A MUCH YOUNGER

126
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,350
GUY.

127
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,052
YOU'RE FULL OF WISDOM.

128
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:44,353
YOU'RE YOUNGER THAN ME.

129
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:47,289
>> AND ANYMORE THE HOUSE

130
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:49,425
LEADERSHIP SO SO I RECOGNIZE

131
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:49,725
THAT.

132
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:52,294
BUT I THINK ALL BOATS RISE IN A

133
00:03:52,294 --> 00:03:53,396
VICTORY AND WINNING BACK THE

134
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:55,231
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

135
00:03:55,231 --> 00:04:00,202
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

136
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:01,103
FOCUSED ON.

137
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:02,304
>> Neil: SO IF NANCY PELOSI

138
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:04,006
WANTED TO BE LEADER, YOU'D VOTE

139
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:04,407
FOR HIM?

140
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:06,842
>> I HAVE SAID, I DON'T THINK --

141
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:09,011
OTHER THAN SUPPORTIVE OF

142
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:09,812
PELOSI.

143
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:10,479
>> Neil: REALLY?

144
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,113
>> YEAH.

145
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:13,749
THE REALITY IS, DEMOCRATS THAT

146
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:17,119
WIN BACK THE HOUSE, BUT IT'S NOT

147
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,954
GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU DISCUSS

148
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:19,688
PALACE INTRIGUE.

149
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:21,490
IT HAS A PLACE HERE IN

150
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,458
WASHINGTON AND A LITTLE BIT

151
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,459
BEYOND IT AS WELL.

152
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:26,429
WE'RE FOCUSED ON NANCY, STENY

153
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:28,431
AND MYSELF AND THE ENTIRE

154
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:29,231
LEADERSHIP --

155
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:31,967
>> Neil: YOUR YOUNGER THAN THOSE

156
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:32,268
GUYS.

157
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:33,602
SO IF THEY CAME TO YOU,

158
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:36,238
CONGRESSMAN AND SAID, YOU KNOW,

159
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:37,807
WE LIKE TO SEE YOU ON THESE

160
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:38,140
THINGS.

161
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,809
WE LIKE THE WAY YOU CAN RELATE

162
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:41,043
TO PEOPLE.

163
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:41,510
WE WANT YOU.

164
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,311
YOU WOULD SAY?

165
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:45,247
>> I'M HONORED THAT I HAVE

166
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:46,749
ELECTED ME OF THE DEMOCRATIC

167
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:47,316
CAUCUS --

168
00:04:47,316 --> 00:04:48,517
>> Neil: YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

169
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:49,285
ANSWER MY QUESTION.

170
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:50,853
>> I'M ENJOY THE ROLE I'M IN

171
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:51,353
RIGHT NOW.

172
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:53,589
>> Neil: STEPPING BACK, SIR, IS

173
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:56,292
IT YOUR SENSE THE ECONOMY -- YOU

174
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:57,860
LOOK AT THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW.

175
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,129
BY ALMOST ALL MEASUREMENTS, IT'S

176
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:01,397
PICKED UP STEAM.

177
00:05:01,397 --> 00:05:02,965
YOU THINK SO?

178
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:05,234
>> THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN AN

179
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:05,568
UPTICK.

180
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:07,503
WE LOOK AT THE JOBLESS FIGURES.

181
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:10,272
AT THE SAME TIME WE LOOK AT THE

182
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:11,740
STAGNATION OF WAGES.

183
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,109
THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT FEELING AS

184
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:15,678
GOOD AS THEMSELVES AS WE WOULD

185
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:16,178
LIKE TO.

186
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:17,480
THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT WE NEED

187
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,648
TO ADDRESS.

188
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:21,951
INSTEAD OF TAPPED INTO THE

189
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:23,652
NATION'S DEBT OF $2.7 TRILLION

190
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:25,120
ON THIS TAX CUT AND REALLY I

191
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,189
THINK -- AGAIN, GOING TOWARDS

192
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:30,125
THE WEALTHIEST 1% AND THE

193
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,861
LARGEST CORPORATION IN THE

194
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:33,295
HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND THE

195
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:35,397
RICHEST, WE COULD HAVE BEEN

196
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:36,232
INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE.

197
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:39,735
THAT'S WHAT WE STILL NEED TO DO.

198
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:42,204
DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL, WE WILL

199
00:05:42,204 --> 00:05:44,039
INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE --

200
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,708
>> Neil: DO YOU FIND IT ODD -- I

201
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,176
KNOW YOU TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS

202
00:05:47,176 --> 00:05:49,478
AND THE MONEY THAT GOES OUT.

203
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:51,180
FOR ANY DEMOCRAT TO LECTURE A

204
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,114
REPUBLICAN ON DEBT.

205
00:05:52,114 --> 00:05:53,549
>> I'M SORRY?

206
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:55,384
>> Neil: DO YOU THINK IT ODD

207
00:05:55,384 --> 00:05:56,719
THAT ANY DEMOCRAT LECTURE

208
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:58,420
REPUBLICANS ON PILING UP DEBT?

209
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,756
>> WHAT I THINK IS ODD IS MY

210
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:02,191
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN THE

211
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:03,926
HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE

212
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:08,163
THAT JUST SPENT $2.7 TRILLION

213
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:09,298
WITH INTEREST SAYING THEY'VE

214
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:10,666
BEEN DOING SOUL SEARCHING AND

215
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,701
NOW THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS THE

216
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:14,136
ISSUE OF THE NATION'S DEBT --

217
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:15,471
>> Neil: WHY IS THE EXTRA MONEY

218
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,840
FOR THE TAX CUT A BIG ISSUE TO

219
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,575
YOU BUT NOT THE EIGHT TO TEN

220
00:06:19,575 --> 00:06:21,043
TRILLION IN ADDED SPENDING NOT

221
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:21,844
AN ISSUE?

222
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:23,178
>> THERE'S MUCH THE BLAME TO GO

223
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:24,613
AROUND ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

224
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:24,914
ISLE.

225
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:26,649
THAT WON'T FIX THE ISSUE ITSELF

226
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:27,016
RIGHT NOW.

227
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:28,517
WE LOOK AT THE TWO WARS THAT

228
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:29,919
WERE UNPAID FOR.

229
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,720
THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE PART

230
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,054
D.

231
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:33,556
WE LOOK AT OTHER THINGS.

232
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:37,960
I'LL REMIND YOU, THE AFFORDABLE

233
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,330
CARE ABLE WAS PAID FOR WHEN

234
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,698
DEMOCRATS WERE IN CONTROL.

235
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:44,266
>> Neil: THAT'S BECAUSE OF

236
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,368
ANTICIPATED EVENTS THAT CHANGED

237
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:46,835
THAT.

238
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:48,304
>> AT THE SAME TIME, THEY OUGHT

239
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:50,439
TO HAVE BEEN PAID FOR.

240
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,308
ALMOST 20 YEARS LATER AND WE

241
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:53,642
HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THAT ISSUE.

242
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:54,543
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

243
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:55,678
HAVE TO DO.

244
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:58,113
WE CAN'T DO IT ON THE BACKS OF

245
00:06:58,113 --> 00:06:59,515
WORKING MEN AND WOMEN.

246
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:00,983
LIKE WE'VE DONE WITH THIS TAX

247
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:01,283
BILL.

248
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:03,185
WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING THAT

249
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:06,255
REALLY FORTIFIES, GIVES A WAGE

250
00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:08,057
INCREASE FOR THE PEOPLE

251
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:08,457
STRUGGLING.

252
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:09,592
>> Neil: I'LL PUT YOU DOWN AS A

253
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:10,993
MAYBE ON THE TAX CUT.

254
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:12,294
>> GOT YOU, NEIL.

255
00:07:12,294 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Neil: THANKS, JOE CROWLEY.
