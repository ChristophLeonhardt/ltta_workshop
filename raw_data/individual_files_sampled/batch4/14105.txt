so one week and two apologies later one of the most important issues of our time continues to roil namely did pastor Charles Ellis touch Ariana Grande's breasts the video evidence says yes but was this contact intentional common sense indicates that it does not appear to be so at all so just call it brass Kade no I do not speak of the infamous Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction at super-bold numeral xxx VIII that was Nipplegate rather I speak of the fallout from the Aretha Franklin funeral incredibly more than a week later so many people are still obsessing about Pastor Charles Ellis and his so-called groping of ariana grande but then again we now reside in the zero tolerance realm of the me - times up era in which the most notable casualty is that which is known as the benefit of the doubt now granted there was indeed contact made visa vie the preacher's hand and the singer's boob at least that's what the video replay would suggest I've got to apologize because I have to brush up my 28-year daughter tells me dad you are old at 16 when I saw ariana grande on the program I thought that was a new something at Taco Bell girl let me give you all your respect did y'all enjoy this icon she's an icon herself come on make a feel of it greater grace temple the City of David so yes it does appear that two of Reverend else's fingers made contact with miss Grande's breasts but I'm betting the farm here that Ellis was oblivious that his digits had entered into a new fly zone and I based this hunch on logic and common sense which is to say if Ellis really were a predator he's clearly not following the standard modus operandi embraced by creeps molesters do not get on a stage in front of hundreds of people to grope someone especially during a funeral service know the perverts out there tend to molest far away from prying eyes and attentive ears they prefer the shadows over the limelight just ask our very own feminist prime minister about his infamous kokanee grope I do not feel that I acted inappropriately in any way suffice to say unintentional contact between two people who are in close proximity can and does happen check out any packed subway train at rush hour it's not a reason to call the cops speaking of which this obsession about the unintentional breasts contact brings to mind the Naked Gun flicks such as that classic scene in which detective Frank Drebin is carefully in navigating an escape via window ledge only to have this happen and then it happened again to Drebin in the supermarket you know folks I can't tell you how many times that's happened to me down at the local law laws anyway pastor Ellis has apologized actually it was a double apology he had to serve up a Mia culpa for that generally funny Taco Bell joke too given that we live in an age in which equip about a mexican-themed fast-food restaurant is deemed to be offensive due to oh I don't know cultural appropriation so in the aftermath can we just kindly move on pastor Ellis has suffered enough embarrassment surely as well for all the trolls out there who can't live without being offended over something fear not guys I'm sure you'll find another innocent man to crucify for no reason whatsoever any second now for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the Breville has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go
