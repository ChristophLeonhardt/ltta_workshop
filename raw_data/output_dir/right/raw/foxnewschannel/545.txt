1
00:00:00,465 --> 00:00:00,966
KAVANAUGH BATTLE.

2
00:00:00,966 --> 00:00:02,767
THAT IS THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

3
00:00:02,767 --> 00:00:07,372
"ANGLE."

4
00:00:07,372 --> 00:00:09,608
THE PRESIDENT GAVE REPUBLICANS A

5
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:10,275
MASTER CLASS IN RETALIATING

6
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:12,777
AGAINST THE TACTICS OF THE LEFT

7
00:00:12,777 --> 00:00:13,645
TODAY.

8
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:15,947
UNDOUBTABLY WEARY OF WATCHING

9
00:00:15,947 --> 00:00:17,849
THE DAILY SMEAR STORM BUFFETING

10
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:19,417
A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, BRETT

11
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:20,252
KAVANAUGH, PRESIDENT TRUMP

12
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:20,986
DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO DO WHAT

13
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:24,990
HE DOES BEST, FIGHT BACK.

14
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,324
>> THE DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING A

15
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:27,659
CON GAME.

16
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:30,629
A CON GAME.

17
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,631
THEY KNOW IT'S A CON GAME.

18
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:34,032
THEY KNOW HE'S HIGH QUALITY.

19
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:35,333
AND THEY WINK AT EACH OTHER.

20
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,403
THEY ARE WINKING.

21
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:39,771
THEY KNOW IT'S A CON GAME.

22
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:40,806
>> Laura: DONALD TRUMP IS

23
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:42,841
NEVER GOING TO BE CONTENT TO

24
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:44,609
HANG BACK AND PLAY DEFENSE WHEN

25
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,311
HE SEES HIS AGENDA IN JEOPARDY.

26
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:48,346
HE TRIED THAT A LITTLE BIT A FEW

27
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:51,083
DAYS LAST WEEK WHEN THIS PIECE

28
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,018
OF AN ALLEGATION WAS DROPPED AND

29
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:54,386
HE WON PRAISE FOR BEING MEASURED

30
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:56,822
AND PRESIDENTIAL.

31
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:59,191
THAT IS NICE BUT MEANWHILE HIS

32
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:01,259
NOMINEE WAS UNDER MASSIVE

33
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:02,361
LEFT-WING ASSAULT.

34
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:04,396
AS REPUBLICANS ON THE COMMITTEE

35
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:05,797
WERE BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO

36
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:08,033
ACCOMMODATE THE ACCUSER'S

37
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:10,202
DEMANDS FOR DELAYS AND VARIOUS

38
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:10,602
CONDITIONS.

39
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:11,603
WELL, TRUMP IS BACK AND NOT A

40
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:13,772
MOMENT TOO SOON.

41
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,140
>> IS A SHAME THAT YOU CAN DO

42
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,774
THIS TO A PERSON'S LIFE.

43
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:19,411
I WILL TELL YOU, MAYBE EVEN MORE

44
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:21,680
IMPORTANT, WHO IS GOING TO WANT

45
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,048
TO GO BEFORE THIS SYSTEM TO BE A

46
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:24,883
SUPREME COURT JUDGE OR TO BE A

47
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:27,219
JUDGE OR TO EVEN BE A

48
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:27,619
POLITICIAN?

49
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:29,121
>> Laura: THAT'S A GREAT

50
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:29,421
POINT.

51
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:30,789
YOU NOTICE HOW HE BOILS IT ALL

52
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,592
DOWN TO A STARK SET OF FACTS?

53
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:34,326
FACTS THAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD BY

54
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:37,229
ALL AMERICANS.

55
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,397
HE'S UNAFRAID -- WHEN EVERYONE

56
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:39,665
ELSE IS TELLING THEM DON'T DO

57
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:42,634
IT, DON'T DO IT -- WHEN

58
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:43,802
NECESSARY, TO COUNTERPUNCH.

59
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:46,038
>> 36 YEARS AGO, NOBODY EVER

60
00:01:46,038 --> 00:01:47,406
KNEW ABOUT IT, NOBODY EVER HEARD

61
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:49,675
ABOUT IT, AND NOW A NEW CHARGE

62
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:50,876
COMES UP, AND SHE SAID, IT MIGHT

63
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:52,277
NOT BE HIM.

64
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:54,413
IT COULD HAVE BEEN HIM, MAYBE

65
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:54,780
NOT.

66
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,384
SHE ADMITS THAT SHE WAS DRUNK.

67
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,351
SHE ADMITS TIME LAPSES.

68
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:02,855
THERE WERE TIME LAPSES.

69
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:04,223
>> Laura: AND HE'S TAKING THE

70
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:05,791
SAME APPROACH ON THE WORLD

71
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:06,592
STAGE.

72
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:08,360
AT THE U.N. TODAY, AT THE GLOBAL

73
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,829
ELITES SHIFTED IN THEIR CHAIRS

74
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:12,197
UNCOMFORTABLY, HE DELIVERED A

75
00:02:12,197 --> 00:02:13,065
FIERCELY PRO-AMERICAN,

76
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:16,402
PRO-SOVEREIGNTY MESSAGE.

77
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,369
>> WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER

78
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:19,805
AMERICA'S SOVEREIGNTY TO AN

79
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:24,043
UNELECTED, UNACCOUNTABLE GLOBAL

80
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,580
BUREAUCRACY.

81
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,748
AMERICA IS GOVERNED BY

82
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:30,115
AMERICANS.

83
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:32,484
WE REJECT THE IDEOLOGY OF

84
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:33,886
GLOBALISM AND WE EMBRACE THE

85
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:37,957
DOCTRINE OF PATRIOTISM.

86
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,158
>> Laura: HE IS DEFIANT.

87
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,759
HE'S AN APOLOGETIC PARADE CLEAR.

88
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,828
WE NEED MORE, NOT LESS OF THAT

89
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:43,128
TODAY.

90
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:45,831
I WANT TO GET BACK TO KAVANAUGH

91
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:48,067
BECAUSE LAST WEEK WITH TRUMP ON

92
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:48,901
THE SIDELINES, SENATE

93
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:49,835
REPUBLICANS WALKED RIGHT INTO

94
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:52,872
THE TRAP SET BY THE LEFT-WING

95
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:53,806
SMEAR SQUAD.

96
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,641
SO FOLKS LIKE SENATOR FLAKE,

97
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:57,076
COLLINS, AND MARKOWSKI, THEY

98
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:00,212
FELT PRESSURED TO GIVE INTO

99
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:00,913
THE ME TOO MILITANTS, FORCING

100
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:03,983
SENATE JUDICIARY CHAIR CHUCK

101
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:04,617
GRASSLEY TO POSTPONE LAST

102
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,019
THURSDAY'S KAVANAUGH VOTE.

103
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,254
WHEN THE DEMOCRATS, THOUGH, WERE

104
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,456
GIVEN AN END, THEY TOOK A MILE,

105
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,525
AND THEY BEGAN TO SLOWLY TAKE TE

106
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,428
CONFIRMATION PROCESS HOSTAGE.

107
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,128
WHAT DID REPUBLICANS GOOD FOR

108
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:19,298
ALL OF THEIR COOPERATION AND

109
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:19,899
SENSITIVITY?

110
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:26,305
AN EXTENDED, VICIOUS.

111
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:26,939
>> I'VE HEARD MANY, MANY

112
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,374
PREDATORS SAY AND REFUTE

113
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,008
ALLEGATIONS.

114
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,209
>> SHE HAS NOTHING TO GAIN AND

115
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,447
EVERYTHING TO LOSE, THAT HE WAS

116
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:38,618
A DRUNKEN, ALMOST RAPIST.

117
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,620
>> THEY ARE WILLING TO PUT

118
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,287
SOMEONE ON THE SUPREME COURT

119
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,657
SOMEONE WHO MAY VERY WELL BE A

120
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,625
PREDATOR.

121
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,527
>> Laura: A MOB LIKE CIRCUS IN

122
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,596
THE HALLWAYS OF THE SENATE

123
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:52,598
OFFICES, AND TO NOW

124
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:53,232
ANTI-KAVANAUGH NASTIES ARE

125
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,768
TARGETING AND TRYING TO

126
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:56,469
HUMILIATE REPUBLICAN SENATORS

127
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:02,775
WHEN THEY ARE OUT IN PUBLIC.

128
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,911
OPEN [CHANTING "WE BELIEVE

129
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:15,021
SURVIVORS"]

130
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,322
>> Laura: I THINK MOST

131
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,791
AMERICANS BRISTLE AT THIS STUFF.

132
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,826
THESE UNCIVIL TACTICS AND SLIMY

133
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:27,367
SPHERES AGAINST GOOD PEOPLE I

134
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,034
THINK ARE EXPOSING JUST HOW

135
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:28,735
RADICALIZED, HOW CONTEMPTIBLE

136
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,335
SOME STRAINS OF TODAY'S

137
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,403
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BECOME.

138
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,537
BUT I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING

139
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,572
POSITIVE THAT HAS EMERGED IN ALL

140
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,440
OF THIS.

141
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,409
REPUBLICANS ARE BEGINNING TO SEE

142
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,043
WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF

143
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,278
ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHING WHEN THEY

144
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,981
WORK TOGETHER.

145
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,283
WITHOUT THE INTERPARTY FIGHTS,

146
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,951
THE WARFARE, THEY CAN ACTUALLY

147
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,686
DO A GOOD DEAL OF GOOD.

148
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:50,189
I AM TOLD THAT

149
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,024
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH IS

150
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,393
MAKING CALLS ON KAVANAUGH'S

151
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,627
BEHALF.

152
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,428
IT WAS VERY ENCOURAGING TO SEE

153
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,664
McCONNELL STAND FIRM.

154
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:03,870
>> JUSTICE MATTERS.

155
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,640
EVIDENCE MATTERS.

156
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,612
FACTS MATTER.

157
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,614
VAGUE, UNSUBSTANTIATED, AND

158
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,216
UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATIONS OF 30

159
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:21,588
PLUS-YEAR-OLD MISCONDUCT, WHERE

160
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:22,922
ALL THE SUPPOSED WITNESSES

161
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:23,623
EITHER TOTALLY DENY IT CAN'T

162
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,960
CONFIRM IT, IS NOWHERE NEAR

163
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,629
GROUNDS TO NULLIFY SOMEONE'S

164
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,631
CAREER OR DESTROY THEIR GOOD

165
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,066
NAME.

166
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:33,833
>> Laura: AMEN.

167
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,202
AND IT'S ABOUT TIME ALL

168
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,303
REPUBLICANS CALLED THIS OUT,

169
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,571
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO BRETT

170
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,939
KAVANAUGH FOR WHAT IT IS.

171
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,976
IT'S A TOTAL DISGRACE.

172
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:43,977
BUT THE DEMOCRATS COME OF

173
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,145
COURSE, CONVENIENTLY LOOK THE

174
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,446
OTHER WAY WHEN THEIR HEROES ARE

175
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:50,583
ACCUSED OF RAPE, ABUSE OF

176
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,618
INTERNS, AND EVEN WHEN THEY

177
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,053
LEAVE A WOMAN TO DIE IN 5 FEET

178
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:53,420
OF WATER.

179
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,556
BRETT KAVANAUGH, WITH NO

180
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,858
CRIMINAL RECORD, AND NO PATTERN

181
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,226
OF ABUSIVE CONDUCT, MUST BE

182
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,395
DESTROYED AT ALL COST.

183
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,166
A LARGER VIEW MAY NOT KNOW THAT

184
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,367
TEXAS SENATE CANDIDATE BETO

185
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,269
O'ROURKE, THE NEW DARLING OF

186
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,504
THE LEFT, ACTUALLY HAS A

187
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,938
CRIMINAL RECORD, INCLUDING A DWI

188
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,874
A DWI END OF BURGLARY ARREST BUT

189
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,042
NO BIG DEAL.

190
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:16,409
[LAUGHS]

191
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:16,710
OKAY.

192
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,544
COME ON.

193
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,612
AT LEAST HE CONDEMNED WHAT

194
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,413
HAPPENED TO TED CRUZ LAST NIGHT.

195
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:23,016
THAT WAS NICE.

196
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:23,784
NEGOTIATING WITH TERRORISTS.

197
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,886
WE HEAR THAT IT'S ALWAYS A BAD

198
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:26,820
IDEA.

199
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,254
ALMOST ALWAYS.

200
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,089
BY DOING SO, WHAT DO YOU GET?

201
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,159
YOU GET MORE TERRORISM.

202
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,360
IT IS GOOD THAT THE G.O.P. HAS

203
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,998
NOT GIVEN INTO THIS RAPID MOB

204
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,400
MENTALITY BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD

205
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,268
HAVE ONLY EMBOLDENED THE WORST

206
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,571
INSTINCTS OF THE LEFT.

207
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,772
SENATOR GRASSLEY DECISION TO

208
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,840
SCHEDULE THE KAVANAUGH COMMITTEE

209
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,009
VOTE THIS FRIDAY IN THE MORNING

210
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,744
IS ANOTHER POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT

211
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,478
TONIGHT.

212
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,581
IF THE G.O.P. CONTINUES TO FIGHT

213
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,849
FOR FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE IN THE

214
00:06:55,849 --> 00:00:00,000
WAY THAT TRUMP HAS ON ISSUE
