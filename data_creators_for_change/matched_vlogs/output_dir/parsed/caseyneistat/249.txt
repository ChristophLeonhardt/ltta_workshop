pretty excited about this Matthew
McConaughey tribute good to see I mean
he insists on this these kinds of
couches he travels with these couches
it's part of this rider it just seems
like it's gonna be more fun up here not
trying to cause any trouble
he's awesome like he's telling but I
didn't know he was awesome so it's so
good dose of a tall guy
he's also extremely handsome he's as
handsome in person as he is in the
movies and charming incredibly charming
guy I wanted those friends of them right
now I get older they stay the same
wasn't he awesome you don't mind being

get a water use the restroom boost it
maybe a snack we have a tiny there's a
little bit of a break Wow
a little bit of a break between that
Matthew McConaughey thing then they're
doing this shorts part of the festival
which is always my favorite part
Jr no yeah I offered him a ride on the
boosted board
you do something incredible here officer
Yatta Yatta Roscoe you got it faster you
just need to go faster okay you almost
have an old school move there's an old
school skateboarding move that you can
do even if you're not a good
skateboarder if you just kind of jump
and if there's like a hanging piece of
chain or one of these you jump over the
thing and you land back on your board
and I said oh great I can this is a rare
opportunity to try that move and then I
looked at it was a little higher than I
thought I mean it's too high to jump you
can do it I can get a skateboard so this
is just a break in between film
screenings in the fear of that we've
been exploring this campus
it's a veteran's home the largest
veterans home in the United States so
one of the veterans told me an Oscar and
I have been skating around and we've
like been meeting veterans and I met a
really nice guy who was super super
psyched about my drone told me a story
about flying a drone in
home hitting the ceiling then it landing
on him and you met a guy named Ralphie
boy Ralphie boy whoo I think I was
trying to connect with by talking about
how my father grew up in a military
background and then I think he was like
oh wait this guy's a hardcore military
dude because he said he could never have
fought even though he served so there
was a nice way of connecting with
different people yeah
great though just great like I think we
want to try it again
I never doubted you for a second Oscar
that's it that finishes the shorts part
like they just showed like six short
movies in a row they were great bye guys
