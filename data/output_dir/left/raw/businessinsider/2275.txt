you've had an extraordinary career we've

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,780
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the New York Times to</font>

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,310
wall street two founding your own

private equity firm to being a key

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,060
member of the Obama administration

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,220
shortly after you left the Obama

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,500
administration you were and still are

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,289
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a scandal with respect to</font>

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:29,910
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened when you were at</font>

quadrangle talk about that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,899
what's going on it's it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

12
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,520
very it's the most painful<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that's</font>

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,380
ever happened to me professionally by a

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,840
wide margin because i've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been criticized</font>

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,460
party there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,230
sure who don't like me who disagree with

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">me that's business i get that if you</font>

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we've made a mistake on how we</font>

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,579
handled chrysler that's fair and it's

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly fair to question my integrity</font>

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,239
it's just unbelievably painful because i

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,340
have been in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working world now for</font>

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,670
35 years without ever having that happen

24
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,170
and so to have it happen is

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,170
extraordinarily painful and it's just

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,519
something you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get behind you but</font>

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,600
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,400
timing of and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can certainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> relate to</font>

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,350
this having had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a similar thing happened</font>

30
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,869
myself and it was personally devastating

31
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,490
and obviously nobody feels sorry for you

32
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,320
they feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had it coming in some</font>

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,600
way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth but as you look</font>

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">back without getting into the details</font>

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,960
are there things you would have done

36
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,520
differently in this particular situation

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,950
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly probably in almost any</font>

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,689
situation that leads to enormous

39
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">personal pain one would say yes there</font>

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,200
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably things I would do</font>

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,509
differently whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel like I had to</font>

42
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:34,590
have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> them differently or simply</font>

43
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,579
should have done them differently or

44
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:36,930
simply life would be more pleasant if I

45
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,869
had done differently<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously nobody if</font>

46
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,159
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> could look forward on any</font>

47
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,509
decision and say this is where it's

48
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,579
going to lead<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I would think you if</font>

49
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:45,509
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead to something like</font>

50
00:01:45,509 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">this you would do things differently</font>
