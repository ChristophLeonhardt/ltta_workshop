1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,890
- Thank you for taking my question.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,430
This question's pretty much for anyone

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,720
who's opposed to abortion.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,070
I'm going to use the
number that I always hear,

5
00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:14,450
that Planned Parenthood has
aborted, is it 50 or 60 million?

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,870
- [Panel Member] All of them.

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,950
- You get my point, high number.

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,213
So my question is, so I am pro-choice,

9
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:25,560
and I think I've heard Ben
say that abortion is evil,

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,430
but my question is when
is it a necessary evil

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,990
for population control,
and my opinion is that

12
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:38,797
we're already at 325
million people right now,

13
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:42,110
I think wages are stagnant,
I think jobs are scarce,

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,177
because simply we are
overpopulated, so what is--

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,180
- [Panel Member] What statistic
can you provide to show

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,320
that wages are stagnant or
that we've run out of jobs?

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,922
- [Audience Member] I mean
people are struggling,

18
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,150
people are struggling,
and I'm seeing everyone--

19
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,620
- So you should kill a
whole lot of other people?

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,180
I'm not tracking your logic.

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,069
- Okay, so my question is
primarily do you guys think

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,070
we would better off with an
additional 60 million people

23
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:16,360
in this country right now
versus had we aborted them?

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,830
- Yeah, so there's this
other thing that happened

25
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,920
in the mid-20th century
where several million people

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,020
were killed in Europe,
and I think the world

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,477
would be better off with
them, what do you guys think?

28
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:28,405
- You can solve an awful lot
of problems by killing people.

29
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:30,860
It's kind of where you
sort of draw the line.

30
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,110
If you don't draw the
line at killing people,

31
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,970
you could solve the problem
of not liking your wife,

32
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,060
you could solve the problem
some guy has the job you want.

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,890
You could solve all those
problems by killing people.

34
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,170
The thing is though there are
seven million unfilled jobs

35
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,840
in this country, seven
million unfilled jobs,

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,890
so we could actually use some population,

37
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,400
and wages are actually not stagnating

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,400
because there are so many
transfers the money people have,

39
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,070
the value of the money people
have is so much further

40
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,360
than it used to be, a poor person today

41
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,760
is living at the level of a
middle-class person in the '80s,

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,180
which is not that long ago,

43
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,540
so we're actually doing
quite well in that regard,

44
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,240
but even if we weren't, I'm
not sure that killing people

45
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,560
is my first go-to.

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,170
- Malthusian Theory, Malthusian economics,

47
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,320
has basically been disproved
over the past 50 years.

48
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,624
Paul Ehrlich was one of the main exponents

49
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:27,070
of Malthusian population control theories.

50
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,750
He wrote a book called The Population Bomb

51
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,420
back in the 1960s in which he predicted

52
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,380
that within 15 years, there
would be mass starvation,

53
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,650
hundreds of millions of
people dying from starvation,

54
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,380
and in the mid '80s he made a bet

55
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,330
with another social
scientist named Julian Simon.

56
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,930
Julian Simon said to him
pick any five commodities,

57
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,060
any five, and tell me that
the price is going to go up,

58
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,640
meaning that we're going
to hit scarcity levels

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,180
because of overpopulation,
and Ehrlich picked five,

60
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,690
and Simon says I don't
care which five you pick,

61
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,220
the price will go down over
time because human ingenuity

62
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,690
is so much more powerful
than population forces.

63
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,210
Simon won the bet, Ehrlich lost the bet,

64
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,270
Ehrlich still teaches at Berkeley.

65
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,340
So it doesn't seem to matter who's right

66
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,000
and who's wrong in this particular debate,

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,140
the fact is that the
population now sustained

68
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,060
on planet Earth is well
over seven billion.

69
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,120
A century ago, it was significantly
less than half of that,

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,400
but we are now living more prosperously

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,180
across virtually every area of the world,

72
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,270
specifically because human
ingenuity is so grand and great,

73
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,120
and killing off incipient human life,

74
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,350
forget about the moral problem
of killing human beings,

75
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,380
killing off the creativity of 60 million

76
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,110
additional human beings
means killing our own future.

77
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,910
- [Panel Member] I used
to be in favor of abortion

78
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,349
when I was young and
irresponsible and stupid.

79
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:37,628
- Before we forced him into
marriage and childbearing.

80
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:40,010
- Forced into living more morally,

81
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,600
so I actually do see this point

82
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,130
and I remember the point at
which my mind was opened,

83
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,350
which is that one has to recognize,

84
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,540
without going into all
the moral questions,

85
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,010
that it is a human life, and as Drew said,

86
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,140
you can solve a lot of
problems by killing people,

87
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,320
so I'll give you the
question that Diana Shaw,

88
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,920
a bioethicist asked me, which is (laughs),

89
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,420
which is if you wanna
control economic problems

90
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,110
or political problems,
other than unborn babies,

91
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,863
which group of Americans
would you be willing to kill?

92
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,380
- [Audience Member] So, can you hear me?

93
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,270
- [Panel] Yes.

94
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,240
- [Audience Member] So I
think there's a significant

95
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,920
difference between a life
that hasn't been born

96
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,190
versus human lives that
are already living,

97
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,980
breathing, eating, et cetera.

98
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,710
- [Panel Member] So where's
your point of viability then?

99
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,320
If you're going to make
the viability argument,

100
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,910
where is your point of viability?

101
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,743
You recognize that it's a human.

102
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,610
- Most like, I'm not exactly
sure how I'm gonna answer.

103
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,693
- Are you a parent?

104
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,910
I think your opinion will
change when you become a parent.

105
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,600
I think your opinion
will change when you hear

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,860
the most beautiful sound
on the face of the planet

107
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,620
which is your child's heartbeat

108
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,320
when it is in your partner's womb.

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,380
I think your opinion will
change when a blood test

110
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,340
at eight weeks shows that
it is a boy or a girl,

111
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,080
and then you can come back to me

112
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,890
and try to make an argument
to kill a human being

113
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,740
because you are making a argument

114
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,960
to value one life more than another,

115
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,315
and I just don't think that's an argument

116
00:05:07,315 --> 00:00:00,000
that's your right to make.
