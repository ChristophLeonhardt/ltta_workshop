I think anything that I've done for the country the firing of James Comey is going to go down as a very good thing FBI is great I know so many people in the FBI the FBI is a fantastic institution but some of the people at the top were rotten apples James Comey was one of them I've done a great service for this country by getting rid of them by firing him see that was president Truong today firing another shot in his fight to discredit the Russia investigation and in his seemingly never-ending war against the FBI director he fired Republican strategist Steve Schmidt characterized the president's actions this way to us earlier today what's increasingly clear whether the target is James Comey whether it's director Muller the Special Counsel the the reality is is this president will burn everything to the ground to protect himself to protect himself from this investigation moving closer to the Oval Office joining us now Jeremy Peters political reporter for The New York Times and Jonathan Allen NBC News national political reporter it's a pleasure to have you both do you agree with that he's gonna burn everything to the ground that threatens him he's making some progress Steve as usual is totally understand but I think you know it's interesting I spoke to some veterans of the Watergate era this week about these issues Richard benveniste who worked in the Special Counsel office back then and John Dean who was the White House Counsel with President Nixon and both of them said that there's a real concern here that the president is weaponizing the tools of government to undermine the model or investigation for his own benefit that and you know Dean actually said there are echoes of Watergate here you know I think there's a lot of deep deep concern among institutionalists and now I don't mean this in an establishment way I just people who care about the institutions of our government about what's going on with President Trump right now I've heard some of their analysis I mean where are they today you know if you talk to them this week where do they think the president has has delivered us with this fake scandal this this manufactured tale of a spy which was never true there was a counterintelligence investigation underway because there were people in the Trump campaign who were so close to Russians that they were under surveillance ostensibly to protect the country to protect the campaign and they kept that secret so there was there was absolutely no political overlay what is their level of concern with the latest twists and turns in all this I think there's a lot of concern I it's interesting because each individual Act may be legal and then of itself you know you can look at it as a lawyer would and they're both lawyers you look at it and say this particular Act may be legal but it also could be part of a chain of obstruction of justice later and so regardless of the legality I think the disruption of norms here is of enormous concern to people who have watched our government Teeter on the breath of crisis before an obstruction of justice is the thing that even the president's allies worry he may have stumbled into inadvertently with his MO that when he as a businessman he was not a by-the-book kind of guy shall we say and and and the defense of Donald Trump from his pals goes like this he was too loose lipped and unorganized if colluded with the Russians but an obstruction yeah he could have some exposure do you think that's behind the character assassination of Jim Comey I think that there's been a brewing effort for a long time now one that we haven't seen because it hasn't come to fruition until now to push Rosen Stein out to discredit the investigation and the investigators even more so than was happening earlier on in the process when Trump was trashing Comey on a daily basis and threatening to fire Jeff Sessions yes so this has been I know from talking to people close to the situation a long time coming the guardrails have finally come off right now that Rudy Giuliani is there now that doubt is gone now that Cobb is gone and the attitude of cooperation is totally out the window so this is what you're seeing you're seeing this kind of this this pent-up aggression finally unleashed and let me ask you are you surprised I got no guardrails I mean a net flood is an establishment Republican attorney are you surprised that someone like flood doesn't have the power or the Moxie or the instinct to walk into the president's office and say hey lighten up on the Comey trashing he is a central witness in the Moller investigation into you and obstruction of justice but ultimately the president is his own chief communications officer chief strategist chief legal counsel and this is with just how he's going to behave there is nothing any advisor can do to stop the president from behaving the way he is and that's why so many of them have quit and going back to what John was saying earlier about the the institutions being trashed here President Trump will stop at nothing to discredit the institutions that are meant to keep leaders honest that includes not only law enforcement but Congress and their investigative power the media most especially which he's come at just incredible Veneman yeah honesty and you know what other institution is in real peril here the Republican Party because they have sat by complicit in all of this most of them not all of them but most of them everyone who's not retiring unless I'm missing anybody you guys have depressed me even further but
