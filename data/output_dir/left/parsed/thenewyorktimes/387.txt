MICHAEL MOORE: Can a Broadway
show bring down a sitting
president?
It was a theory I
had, a question.
I thought.
well, why not?
Let's give it a try.
We've tried everything
else since January.
Here's hair and makeup.
OK.
I'm done.
"The Terms of my Surrender"
is a one-man show.
It's a piece of theater that
I've written that I wanted
to perform live.
A lot of things I talk about
are necessarily about Trump,
per se.
I don't think there's
anything really new to say,
at this point.
I think we get the drill.
But I do have a lot to say about
us and how I think we ended up
with him, and maybe how to
prevent something like this
from ever happening again.
I'm not going
through it in 2018.
I'm not going
through it in 2020.
So you have to join me here.
To do it in the city where
the Clinton campaign was,
where so much of liberal America
has its base, it's like I,
as a Midwesterner, want
to say to the base, here,
come out of the bubble.
We can win.
We can do this.
But you've got to understand
what's going on between
the Hudson River and
La Cienega Boulevard.
You know?
I-- it's-- there's a
lot going on out there.
It's a daily 
show hitting us, right?
Like a firehose of
 every day,
just one piece of 
after another, coming.
Did I say every day?
Every hour!
Filming takes a while, and the
show is happening right now,
as you see it.
There's no editor.
The producers, even though
they may be in the house,
they can't edit me or tell
me what to say or whatever.
- Did he ask for-- is
this a new question now?
MICHAEL MOORE: Any time I'm let
loose, every night at 8:03 PM--
- Let me fact-check it quickly.
MICHAEL MOORE: You know,
anything could happen here.
That makes a lot of
people nervous here.
But-- but it'll be fine.
It's-- so far, no one has died.
What's the latest today?
That Steven Bannon is thinking
of-- he's trying to convince
to name that Stephen Miller
guy from Mars as the new White
House communications director.
I enjoy the conversation
with my fellow Americans.
I'm-- it's a privilege
to live in this country.
But the rights I have
are not privileges.
They come to me by the very
power and the very fact that I
am an American.
And I have these rights
to speak my mind,
to encourage others to rise
up to either take this country
back or take us into
a better direction.
And I have a lot of faith that
my fellow Americans who feel
the same way are
going to do that.
Are you with me?
Who's going to do
the ??
