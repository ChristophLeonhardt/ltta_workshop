1
00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:02,269
ARE WORKING HARD TRYING TO

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,204
PROVIDE YOU GOOD INFORMATION

3
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:04,705
AND TRYING TO PROVIDE THAT

4
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:05,706
SAME GOOD INFORMATION TO THE

5
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:06,240
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

6
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,874
>> Harris: YOU KNOW,

7
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,209
SPEAKER, THERE HAS BEEN TALK

8
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:10,211
RECENTLY ABOUT WHETHER WE EVEN

9
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:11,278
NEED WHITE HOUSE PRESS

10
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,680
BRIEFINGS EVERY DAY.

11
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,014
THAT MAYBE SOME OF THEM SHOULD

12
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,082
BE IN AN OFFICE AND NOT ALL

13
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:16,884
TELEVISED BECAUSE IT LOOKS

14
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,419
LIKE SOME OF THE REPORTERS

15
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:19,854
MIGHT BE DOING GRANDSTANDING.

16
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,122
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THAT.

17
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,892
>> Newt: LOOK, I ADVOCATED

18
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:25,993
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

19
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:26,827
ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY GET

20
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,963
RID OF THE WHOLE THING.

21
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:29,797
>> Harris: REALLY?

22
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:31,098
NOT EVEN OFF THE RECORD?

23
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,400
I WAS DRIPPING WITH SARCASM

24
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,735
WHEN I SAID I COULDN'T IMAGINE

25
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:35,236
IT.

26
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,403
>> Newt: HERE IS WHAT I MEAN

27
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,705
TO GET RID OF THE WHOLE THING.

28
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,908
YOU HAVE A RELATIVELY SMALL

29
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,443
NUMBER OF REPORTERS WHO ARE

30
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:43,310
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ARE IN

31
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,777
THE WHITE HOUSE.

32
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:44,512
THEY ARE PRESSURE.

33
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:45,579
THEY SIT AROUND AND TALK TO

34
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,680
EACH OTHER ALL DAY.

35
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,482
DEEP DOWN THEY RESENT THE FACT

36
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:49,884
THAT THEY ARE VOYEURS.

37
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,819
THEY ARE AT THE BECKON CALL OF

38
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:52,620
THE PRESIDENT.

39
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,854
>> Harris: HAS IT ALWAYS

40
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,222
EXISTED OR JUST NOW?

41
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,157
>> Newt: EXISTED SINCE AT

42
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,092
LEAST KENNEDY.

43
00:00:58,092 --> 00:00:59,226
THE RISE OF TELEVISION.

44
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,861
MY POINT IS JUST THERE ARE A

45
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:01,862
THOUSAND WAYS TO COMMUNICATE

46
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,598
WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

47
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,133
YOU DON'T OWE THE AMERICAN

48
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,935
PEOPLE HAVING 50 OR 60 -- YOU

49
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,236
HAVE THREE OR FOUR CLOWNS WHO

50
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,638
INSIST ON GETTING IN FIGHTS

51
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:11,372
WITH HER.

52
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:12,606
AND THEY ARE ONLY IMPORTANT

53
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,475
BECAUSE THEY GET IN FIGHTS

54
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:15,476
WITH HER.

55
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:16,210
>> Harris: CLICK BAIT ON

56
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,378
SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE THEY CAN

57
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,680
CLIP THAT PIECE OF VIDEO AND

58
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,681
IT'S CLICK BAIT.

59
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:21,582
LOOK, IF ANYBODY DOESN'T THINK

60
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,783
THAT IS HAPPENING CHECK OUT

61
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:26,921
THE TWITTER FEEDS.

62
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:27,555
>> Kennedy: I UNDERSTAND

63
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,756
THAT EVERY POLITICIAN WANTS TO

64
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,057
GET THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY

65
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:30,424
OUT.

66
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,326
THAT IS A NATURAL INCLINATION.

67
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,128
I ROLLED MY EYES WHEN HILLARY

68
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:34,695
CLINTON DID IT.

69
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:35,930
I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY

70
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,631
HERE TO HAVE A WEBSITE FOR

71
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:37,965
THAT.

72
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,466
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY

73
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,301
ADEPT AT USING TWITTER FOR

74
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,769
THAT.

75
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,572
HE HAS OVER 50 MILLION TWITTER

76
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,273
FOLLOWERS AND HE DIRECTS THE

77
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,441
MEDIA WHERE HE WANTS THEM TO

78
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:47,775
GO.

79
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,109
I LIKE THE EXCHANGES.

80
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,678
I LIKE ANY SORT OF AN OPEN

81
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:51,946
FORUM WHERE THE IDEA CAN GET

82
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:52,580
OUT.

83
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,781
I ALSO LIKE -- I THINK SARAH

84
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,983
SANDERS DOES A VERY GOOD JOB

85
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,685
AT KEEPING THINGS TIGHT AND

86
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:58,419
SWATTING PEOPLE DOWN.

87
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:02,990
SHE HAS GOT AN INCREDIBLY

88
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,091
DIFFICULT JOB AND IT IS EASY

89
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,326
FOR PEOPLE IN THE ROOM TO GANG

90
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,461
UP ON HER.

91
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,829
HER COMPORTMENT IS BETTER THAN

92
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,663
SOME OF PEOPLE WHO PRECEDED

93
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:10,997
HER.

94
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,132
NOT JUST IN THIS

95
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,601
ADMINISTRATION BUT OTHERS.

96
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,635
>> Abby: THE REASON SHE IS

97
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,836
THERE THAT LONG SPEAKS TO HOW

98
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:16,637
GOOD SHE HAS BEEN.

99
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,605
THE REPORTERS HAVE EVERY RIGHT

100
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:18,806
TO ASK ABOUT CERTAIN QUESTIONS

101
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,174
LIKE THE DON JUNIOR MEETING.

102
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,575
WHY WERE THEY DISHONEST FROM

103
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,209
THE BEGINNING?

104
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,577
I THINK THE CHECKS AND THE

105
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,511
BALANCES IS AN IMPORTANT

106
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:24,845
THING.

107
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,013
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE

108
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,081
GOING ON AND YOU MAKE THAT

109
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:27,781
POINT, SPEAKER.

110
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,883
THEY ARE IN SUCH A RUSH TO

111
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,118
FIND THE NEGATIVE THAT THE

112
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:31,685
PRESIDENT IS DOING.

113
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,087
THE PERFECT EXAMPLE IS APRIL

114
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:33,721
RYAN YESTERDAY.

115
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,422
THEY THREW THIS BIRTHDAY BASH

116
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,391
WHEN THE EAGLES, WHEN HE

117
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,359
DISINVITED THEM FROM THE WHITE

118
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,226
HOUSE ON THE SOUTH LAWN.

119
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,628
SHE TWEETED OUT THERE WERE A

120
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:41,929
BUNCH OF BOOS TO THE PRESIDENT

121
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:44,665
AND SHE HAD TO DELETE THE

122
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,466
TWEET BECAUSE IT WASN'T

123
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:45,866
ACCURATE.

124
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,635
BUT THE MOMENT THAT THE TWEET

125
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,169
WAS UP THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF

126
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,104
RETWEETS BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT

127
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:51,171
TO BELIEVE THE NARRATIVE.

128
00:02:51,171 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING
