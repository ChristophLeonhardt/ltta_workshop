the next story is from the UK charlie rally and don sturgis allegedly handled an item containing the poison nova chuck which may sound familiar because it's one of the deadliest nerve agents ever created and was used allegedly by the russian government to assassinate a former russian spy in the UK in March now it does not appear that the item that they or that rather that the two people who were poisoned were targeted it seems that they just picked up the item and we're poisoned inadvertently but the fact that there is poison floating around the UK again allegedly from Russia has startled a lot of people in the UK this is what the UK Home Secretary had to say when he called on Russia to explain what's going on it is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on let me be clear we do not have a quarrel with the Russian people rather it is the actions of the Russian government that this that continue to undermine our security and that of the international community we will stand up to the actions that threaten our security and the security of our partners it is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets all for our streets our parks our towns to be dumping grounds for poison we will continue with our investigations as a matter of urgency and I will keep the house and the public updated on any significant developments now unsurprisingly Russia has denied that they had anything to do with this NTV not MTV NTV which is a Russian television channel that used to be critical of the Putin administration and then the owner was arrested and the government took over the channel and gave it to the state oil company which is kind of how Russia works now anyway they on that channel they called it Groundhog Day and they said that the allegation was baseless and that they'd been hearing about this poison forever and that it was totally ridiculous when you know every every intelligence community and and I mean we know it's Russia it's alleged but but we know this is how they operate what's the most likely single source we don't know for sure they're gonna investigate it as they did the last ones we can't say for sure because we don't know right theoretically anyone could have had access to it I believe that with that particular nerve agent the only group that is known to have access to it is the Russian government it's not impossible these are allegations at this point that obvious so they're gonna look into but I also know that this is the sort of story that for whatever reason for about a year now if anything bad happens and it can be connected in any way to Russia you're supposed to ignore it because if you don't if you don't ignore it then you're a McCarthyite or something from people who have no idea what that actually means and that's weird so we're gonna do the responsible thing which is report on the news and then say that these are allegations that are being investigated that's the situation I think so I mean I was born in the former USSR my family aspo contunue you know essentially how how the russian intelligence and and government has has operated and if you look at the past year russia has gotten away much last year the past five years russia has gotten away with more and more and more i mean we talk about russia a lot but that's because russia has done a lot I mean we could say they allegedly have poisoned a Russian spy and and now these people have you know gotten involved in that they shot down a civilian plane nothing happened they annexed Crimea nothing happened they've meddled in our election and ostensibly elected a very pro-russian president who by the way I remembered this today still hasn't implemented sanctions that he is required by Congress to implement there is so much that that they're doing that there is no accountability for and now with Donald Trump in office making NATO weaker making the EU weaker it's kind of terrifying to realize that the forces that came together after after World War Two and during the Cold War to oppose Russia to prevent it from from you know invading and destroying other countries is at its weakest point ever right now so they with no accountability and no defense I'm kind of terrified to see what Russia is planning great um this I want to go back to it because you were talking about state-owned TV the state-owned Russian TV channel Russia one suggested it might have been staged by the British government out of spite over the fabulous World Cup hosted by Russia and I just thought by golly gee whiz this sounds so familiar fabulous I'm pretty sure that's not what happened does that sound so familiar it does it does maybe the UK government staged it but if they did it wasn't because of the World Cup I think we can all agree on that it just sounds like just jealous interesting tweets that oh by some somebody I guess we remain nameless for yet just again it'll be investigated we'll know more at some point most people won't accept the final results of the investigation but it will be investigated two easy ways follow Young Turks want
