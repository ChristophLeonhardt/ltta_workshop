BE REPLANTED VERY SOON.
SO NO DRAMA THERE.
ROB: THAT'S WHAT I WAS WONDERING
MIKE POMP BOW WRAPPING UP TRIP
TO MIDDLE EAST AFTER SENDING
WARNING TO IRAN THAT THE U.S. IS
READY TO PULL OUT OF THE NUCLEAR
DEAL.
AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TEAM SENDING A
STERN MESSAGE TO NATIONS AROUND
THE WORLD.
>> IF, IN FACT, KIM HAS MADE A
STRATEGIC DECISION TO GIVE UP
PROGRAM, THEN I THINK DECIDING
ON THE PLACE AND DATE SHOULD BE
FAIRLY EASY.
>> WE REMAIN CONCERN OF CONCERNS
OF ESCALATION OF THREATS AND
IRAN AMBITIONS TO DOMINATE
MIDDLE EAST REMAINS.
ROB: IS THIS THE FOREIGN POLICY
THAT AMERICA NEEDS RIGHT NOW?
HERE TO DEBATE MEDIA RON MYER
AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGISTS
ANTOINE, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON
THIS MORNING.
>> GOOD MORNING.
ROB: RON, WE WILL START WITH
YOU, AFTER 8 YEARS OF RELATIVE
SOFTNESS AS FAR AS FOREIGN
POLICY AND PREDICTILITY, I
THINK, THIS IS COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT.
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE PRESIDENT
IS GOING TO DO AT ANY GIVEN TIME
AND HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE SHY
ABOUT STARTING A FIGHT, WHAT DO
YOU SAY?
>> WELL, WHETHER YOU LOOK AT
TRADE OR DIFFERENT NEGOTIATIONS
LIKE TRYING TO REOPEN THE IRAN
DEAL, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE
ARE GOING TO BE IN A BETTER
POSITION AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THE IRAN DEAL OBVIOUSLY WASN'T
THE BEST DEAL FOR THE UNITED
STATES AND I THINK EUROPE IS
GOING TO BE OPEN TO LOOKING AT
IT IN TRYING TO SEE IF IT COULD
BE MADE STRONGER AND HOW IS THAT
NOT BETTER FOR THE UNITED
STATES?
IF YOU LOOK AT TRADE, OBVIOUSLY
THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE ONLY GONE
OUR WAY, YES, THERE WERE TARIFFS
AND COSTS IN THE SHORT TERM BUT
COUNTRIES LIKE SOUTH KOREA HAVE
CHANGED TRADE LAWS TO BE
FRIENDLIER TO THE UNITED STATES
AND WE HEAR ABOUT CHINA AND
THOSE NEGOTIATIONS.
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WITH
NORTH KOREA, THINGS ARE MORE
HOPEFUL THAN THEY HAVE EVER
BEEN, WHEN YOU HAVE POMPEO AND
BOLTON WHO ARE HAWKS, IT PUTS
YOU IN GREAT NEGOTIATING
POSITION.
ROB: REPUBLICANS ARE QUICK TO
TAKE A LOT OF CREDIT AND THE
PRESIDENT TO TAKE A LOT OF
CREDIT WHERE WE ARE IN THE
NEGOTIATION, DEMOCRATS SAY WE
HAVE BEEN PROMISED BEFORE AND
HAD THE RUG PULLED OUT FROM ALL
OF US BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME
PROGRESS MADE, KIM JONG UN IS AT
THE TABLE AND WALKED ACROSS THE
DMZ LAST NIGHT THAT WAS
SOMETHING.
>> IT'S BEEN PROGRESS MADE BUT
WE ARE NOT ACROSS THE FINISH
LINE YET AND THE PRESIDENT WANTS
TO RAISE HAND IN VICTORY BEFORE
WE GET FINISH LINE AND WE HAVE
TO BE STRATEGIC AND THINK
LONG-TERM WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUE
OF FOREIGN POLICY BECAUSE THIS
WAS SUPERCEDE TRUMP, THIS WILL
SUPERCEDE HIS ADMINISTRATION,
THIS WILL SUPERCEDE A
REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED CONGRESS,
THIS WILL SUPERCEDE PARTISAN
POLITICS IN THE COUNTRY.
WE HAVE TO BE STRATEGIC AND
SMART ABOUT ANY FOREIGN POLICY
DECISION GOING FORWARD.
ROB: AS FAR AS IRAN GOES, YOU
HAVE DEMOCRATS LIKE WE HAVE
CHRIS COONS ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY
WITH CHRIS WALLACE SAYING THAT
THERE IS AN IDEA FOR A BETTER
DEAL ON THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL,
DEMOCRATS ADMITTING THAT THAT
DEAL WASN'T THAT GREAT, THAT WE
COULD MAKE THAT A LOT BETTER.
>> OF COURSE, WE COULD HAVE MADE
IT A LOT BETTER BUT I THINK WE
HAVE TO GET OUT THIS NOTION OF
THE REDO AND UNDO POLICIES,
SOUND BITE AND TWEET PURPOSES,
WE HAVE TO REALLY THINK
LONG-TERM AND BE STRATEGIC ABOUT
WHAT WE DO.
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
DOUBT THAT ADDING STRINGS
ATTACHED, WE SHOULD HAVE REAL
INSPECTORS INSTEAD OF IRAN
TELLING US TED CRUZ OKAY.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GOING
TO WORK GREAT OR NOT, THE
COUNTRY SHOULD BE GENUINELY
EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
IF WE SOLVE THE KOREAN CONFLICT,
IF THIS ADMINISTRATION SOLVES
THE KOREAN CONFLICT THAT WOULD
BE MONUMENTAL AND HISTORIC
CONTRIBUTION.
WE SHOULD BE ROOTING FOR THIS --
ROB: LET ME CUT THAT OFF.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MEDIA, THE
DEMOCRATS GIVING THE PRESIDENT
CREDIT AS FAR AS SOME
ACCOMPLISHMENTS HE HAS HAD.
ANTONE YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT
GETS IN HIS OWN WAY.
>> AS SOON AS IT'S TIME FOR HIM
TO GET CREDIT WHERE HE'S
PARTIALLY DUE HE GETS DISTRACTED
BY A TWEET AND OTHER MATTER AND
THE ATTENTION GETS AWAY FROM
WHERE HE EARNS CREDIT.  I'M NOT
ONE THAT YOU SHOULD GET CREDIT
FOR AN ASSIGNMENT UNTIL IT'S
COMPLETE AND THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY AND RIGHT-WING MEDIA WANTS
TO DO THAT, I'VE NEVER LIVED BY
THAT CONCEPT.
ROB: RON, THE PRESIDENT'S PERMIT
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN BE A LOT
TO DIGEST BUT THERE HAVE BEEN
GREAT STRIDES MADE, A LOT OF
PEOPLE LOVE THE IDEA OF TAKING
BACK SOME RIGHTS IN TRADE DEALS
AND MAKING THE DEALS FAIR, IT'S
VERY REFLESHING AFTER ALL THESE
YEARS OF LOSING IN SOME OF THE
DEALS, RIGHT?
>> IT'S SO FUNNY, THE DEMOCRATS
ATTACKED -- THEY CAN'T ATTACK
THE POLICY BECAUSE TAX CUTS ARE
WORKING --
>> TAX CUTS ARE NOT WORKING,
RON.
>> THEY ATTACK PERSONALITY WHEN
THE PERSONALITY IS ACTUALLY
HELPING ON POLICY, THERE'S NO
DOUBT PERSONALITY THAT'S THE
ARE WITH NORTH KOREA, THEY ARE
AFRAID OF TRUMP AND THAT'S ONE
OF THE REASONS THEY ARE COMING
TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.
SAME THING ON TRADE.
WITHOUT THE PERSONALITY AND THIS
APPROACH, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT
WE COULD NOT BE WHERE WE ARE
WITHOUT THIS STYLE OF
PRESIDENCY.
>> RON, NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN
HERE BEFORE LET'S NOT BE FOOLED
THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE THE
POSITION THEY'VE TAKEN BEFORE
WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS
POSITION BEFORE.
ROB WILL BE WE DON'T KNOW.
WE HAVE TO WRAP IT UP THERE, WE
ARE CERTAINLY TAKING A DIFFERENT
