1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:07,030
WELL, AS AN EX-GIRLFRIEND OF
MINE ONCE SAID ñ

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,379
WE GOT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ON
THE RUN.

3
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:11,249
I DO NOT MEAN THEY ARE RUNNING
FROM OFFICE, I MEAN THEY ARE

4
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:13,110
RUNNING FROM OFFICE.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,711
THE LATEST CASUALTY ñ RODNEY
FRELINGHUYSEN FROM THE STATE OF

6
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:20,810
NEW JERSEY, HE GOT WATCHED AND

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,340
CRUNCHED IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:40,650
LET'S EXPLAIN HIS DISTRICT AND
WHY HE IS NO LONGER RUNNING.

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,610
IF TRUMP ONLY ONE YOUR DISTRICT
BY ONE POINT IN 2016, YOU KNOW

10
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,610
WHAT THAT MEANS?

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:52,690
THE NUMBERS
HAVE MOVED COMPLETELY.

12
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,670
NOW A GENERIC DEMOCRAT BEATS A
GENERIC REPUBLICAN IN

13
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:06,140
CONGRESSIONAL RACES AMONG LIKELY
VOTERS WITH AN ASTOUNDING 14%.

14
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:18,710
THEY ARE IN A WORLD 
OF TROUBLE.

15
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,090
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS LESS
POPULAR WAS THEIR HEALTHCARE

16
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,190
PROPOSAL WHICH PULLED AT 17%.

17
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,260
I WOULD SAY THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IS COMING FOR THEM EXCEPT

18
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,350
THEY DO.

19
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:40,770
I WILL GIVE YOU THE SENSE OF HOW
BIG THAT WAVE IS IN A SECOND.

20
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,690
BUT THERE IS ONE OTHER THING
GOING AGAINST THIS PARTICULAR

21
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,770
CONGRESSMAN, HE VOTED AGAINST
THE TAX CUTS.

22
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,580
HE DID IT FOR A VERY GOOD
REASON, IN HIS DISTRICT IN NEW

23
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,670
JERSEY TAXES ARE GOING TO GO UP
BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT WAS

24
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,880
STRUCTURED AND PUNISHES BLUE

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,490
STATES MORE AND TAKES IT OUT ON
THEIR REAL ESTATE ñ

26
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,470
SO IT HURTS HIS DISTRICT.

27
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,229
THAT IS PARTLY BECAUSE HE HAS
MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE IN IT.

28
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,810
SO HE VOTED AGAINST IT BUT THAT
MAKES THE BASE REALLY ANGRY

29
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,270
AND HENCE THE- CRUTCH.

30
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,350
HERE IS AN EXPLANATION.

31
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,180
THE
CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE

32
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,660
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ñ

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:39,190
THAT IS A GIANT JOB, A REALLY
POWERFUL POSITION.

34
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:48,800
REPUBLICANS HAVE INSTITUTED TERM
LIMITS FOR THEMSELVES.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,780
HE WAS NOWHERE NEAR THE
TERM LIMIT.

36
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:59,810
BUT HE SEES WITH HIS BASE GONE,
WITH MOST OF HIS VOTERS IN THE

37
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:14,450
DISTRICT ñ EVEN IF YOU MIGHT
LOSE A COMMITTEE ANYWAY.

38
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,709
LET'S GIVE YOU A SENSE OF
CONTEXT.

39
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,610
35 PEOPLE, THAT IS A RECORD.

40
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:28,720
AND WE ARE NOT ANYWHERE NEAR
THE ELECTION YET.

41
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,120
EVEN THE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR
OTHER OFFICE, FOR EXAMPLE A

42
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,700
REPRESENTATIVE IN ARIZONA NOW

43
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,909
RUNNING FOR THE SENATE.

44
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:44,300
SHE IS GETTING KILLED IN
HER OWN DISTRICT.

45
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,360
THE ONLY WAY SHE WINCES
MAYBE STATEWIDE.

46
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,790
A LOT OF THEM HAVE RESIGNED OR
RETIRED BECAUSE THEY REALIZE

47
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,790
THEY HAVE NO CHANCE OF WINNING.

48
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:06,300
BIG REPUBLICAN STALWARTS LIKE
DARRELL ISSA, GONE.

49
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,430
IF YOU FOLLOW POLITICS, NINE
COMMITTEE CHAIRS, AND FOR

50
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,488
IMPORTANT POSITIONS.

51
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:19,658
THE ONLY LEAVE WHEN THEY
HAVE NO CHOICE.

52
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,800
WE ARE JUST IN JANUARY 2018.

53
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:34,180
THAT BLUE WAVE, OR BLUE WEDDING
COULD BE ENORMOUS IN 2018.

54
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,939
IT'LL BE A GREAT DAY IN AMERICA
IF ON THAT NIGHT WE GET TO

55
00:04:37,939 --> 00:00:00,000
CONCLUDE OUR BROADCAST WITH
PROGRESSIVES SEND THEIR REGARDS.
