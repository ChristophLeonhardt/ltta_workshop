>> Martha: HOMELESSNESS IN
SEATTLE IS A BIG PROBLEM, BUT
AMAZON CRIED UNCLE WHEN THEY
WERE ASKED TO FOOT THE BILL.
WEEKS AFTER THE CITY PASSED WHAT
IS CALLED A HEAD TAX, THE
CITY COUNCIL NOW SAYING
NEVER MIND AFTER AMAZON
THREATENED TO LEAVE THE CITY.
THE BILL WOULD HAVE FORCED
BUSINESSES THAT PULL IN OVER
$20 MILLION TO PAY $275 PER
EMPLOYEE.
FOR AMAZON, THE CITY'S LARGEST
EMPLOYER, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE THAN $12 MILLION A YEAR,
BUT SMALLER BUSINESSES WITH
TIGHTER MARGINS WOULD HAVE FELT
EVEN MORE.
BILL BENNETT THE HOST OF THE
BILL BENNETT PODCAST AND A
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND STEVE
HILTON, HOST OF THE NEXT
REVOLUTION HERE ON FNC.
BILL, YOU TAKE THE FIRST CRACK
ON THIS, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?
>> THIS IS A KIND OF A LIBERAL
SHOCK OF RECOGNITION.
AMAZON AND STARBUCKS FIGURED OUT
THEIR COMPANIES, THEIR
BUSINESSES.
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW BAD THINGS
MUST BE IF AMAZON AND STARBUCKS
ARE THREATENING TO LEAVE
SEATTLE?
TALK ABOUT A MOTHERSHIP, A
LIBERAL COMMUNITY, BUT THERE
THEY WERE.
THEY FLEXED THEIR BUSINESS
MODEL, REMINDED PEOPLE THAT THEY
ARE A BUSINESS IN THE
CITY COUNCIL TURNED AROUND ON A
DIME.
>> Martha: IT SO INTERESTING,
STEVE.
AS BILL HAS JUST POINTED OUT, TO
WATCH THIS DYNAMIC AT PLAY,
BECAUSE ITS TAXATION, TAXATION,
TAXATION AND THEY FINALLY SAID
NO.
I LOVE THIS QUOTE FROM AMAZON
VICE PRESIDENT AND SPOKESMAN
DREW HERKIMER WHO SAID THE CITY
DOES NOT HAVE A REVENUE PROBLEM,
IT HAS A SPENDING EFFICIENCY
PROBLEM.
THAT PRETTY MUCH SAYS IT ALL,
DOESN'T IT?
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT, AND I
THINK THAT FRANKLY NOBODY COMES
OUT OF THIS WELL.
WHAT A RIDICULOUS WAY OF TRYING
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF
HOMELESSNESS WITH THIS STUPID
TAX.
THE REASON THAT YOU GOT THIS
HOMELESS PROBLEM IS BECAUSE OF
THEIR STUPID POLICIES THAT MAKE
HOUSING SO EXPENSIVE, THE
REGULATIONS THAT MAKE IT SO
EXPENSIVE TO BUILD A HOUSE.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS,
THE ZONING REGULATIONS, IT'S
CONTRIBUTE TO HOMELESSNESS.
THE IDEA OF SLAPPING ATTACKS ON
AMAZON -- BUT FRANKLY DON'T
REALLY LIKE THE WAY THEY SAY YOU
MAY WANT TO TAX US BUT WE DECIDE
WHAT TAXES WE PAY, NOT YOU.
I THINK EVERYBODY COMES OUT OF
THIS BAD.
>> Martha: CHOOSE A DIFFERENT
STATE IF THEY THINK THAT STATE
IS GOING TO BE BETTER FOR THEM.
I DO WANT TO SQUEEZE IN THIS
STORY ABOUT CHICKEN SHAMING.
WE HEARD ABOUT FAT SHAMING.
POOR JACK DORSEY, THE TWITTER
AND SQUARE CEO TOOK A PICTURE OF
THIS CASHBACK PROGRAM HE GOT AT
CHICK-FIL-A AND BOY DID HE GET
POUNCED ON BECAUSE THE CEO OF
CHICK-FIL-A IN THE PAST HAS SAID
THAT HE IS NOT IN FAVOR OF
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, SO THEN
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN JUMPED IN AND
SAID THIS IS AN INTERESTING
COMPANY TO BOOST DURING PRIDE
MONTH.
JACK QUICKLY CAME BACK AND SAID
OF HIS TWEET, I'M SO SORRY, YOU
ARE RIGHT.
I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THEIR
BACKGROUND.
PHIL.
>> THE PRESIDENT OF TWITTER
INADVERTENTLY CAME ON THE TRUTH,
WHICH IS THAT CHICK-FIL-A IS A
GREAT THING.
IT'S A GREAT MEAL.
THE ONLY TIME YOU APOLOGIZE OR
SAY YOU'RE SORRY FOR HAVING
CHICK-FIL-A IS IF YOU FIND A
BONE IN IT, WHICH HAS NEVER
HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY.
>> Martha: ITS BONELESS.
>> GO TO ATLANTA AIRPORT.
GO TO SHOPPING CENTERS, WE GO UP
AND DOWN INTERSTATE 95.
WHERE IS THE LONGEST LINE?
CHICK-FIL-A.
I DON'T MUCH APPROVE OF AMAZON'S
POLITICS EITHER.
LIKE STEVE WAS SAYING.
BUT I SURE USE THEM.
THIS IS JUST CRAZY.
IT TELLS YOU ABOUT THE SAME TIME
THE BULLYING ASPECT THAT STEVE
REFERRED TO, BUT ALSO HOW THEY
CAN BE INTIMIDATED BY FORCES OF
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.
THIS CRAVEN BEHAVIOR IS REALLY
SHAMEFUL.
>> Martha: YOU CAN SEND A
TWEET AND THE FORCES JUST COME
IN AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU
WERE SPINNING YOUR WAY OUT OF
IT.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
>> I FOUND OUT SOMETHING VERY
INTERESTING THE DAY BEFORE THIS
TWEET BY JACK DORSEY THAT
BROUGHT DOWN THE WRATH OF THE
HEAT PUMP, HE ALSO SENT OUT
ANOTHER TWEET.
NOT THAT LONG AGO THE DALAI LAMA
SAID THIS ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE,
WHICH IS THE REASON FOR
CHICK-FIL-A.
THEY WANT ME TO CONDONE
HOMOSEXUALITY.
I AM A BUDDHIST.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO MEN
IS WRONG.
MORE RECENTLY HE SAID PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BELIEF OR HAVE SPECIAL
TRADITIONS AND YOU SHALL FOLLOW
ACCORDING TO YOUR TRADITION.
I DIDN'T NOTICE THE TWITTER HATE
MOB FROM THE LOONY LEFT TO SEND
ON JACK DORSEY FOR RE-TWEETING
THE DALAI LAMA DESPITE HIS VIEWS
ON HOMOSEXUALITY AND IT MUST
MAKE YOU THINK THIS IS NOT
REALLY ABOUT DEFENDING
TRADITIONAL VIEWS OF MARRIAGE,
IT'S REALLY ABOUT BEING
ANTI-CHRISTIAN.
THAT'S WHAT WE USED TO CALL
BIGOTRY.
>> Martha: QUICK THOUGHT,
BILL.
>> JACK DORSEY MAY NEXT NEED TO
BE CAREFUL.
HE MAY ORDER A CAKE FROM THE
