National Defense Authorization Act and based on what we know about this bill so far the defense bill it would give the Defense Department 717 billion dollars for fiscal year 2019 now there are specific details that I want to get to and then we have a few clips of the speech that he gave in you know celebrating the signing of the NDAA now this year's National Defense Authorization Act authorizes about 639 billion dollars for the base budget of the Pentagon and defense programs of the Energy Department it also allows for another sixty nine billion dollars for a war fund known as the overseas contingency operations account now CNBC also reported that there is an additional twenty one point nine billion dollars for nuclear weapons programs under the Energy Department okay so this it fulfills the administration's priorities to bulk up the military including adding fifteen thousand six hundred troops across the Army Navy Air Force and Marine Corps so everything that's being done under this NDAA makes it abundantly clear that there will be more funding for war efforts essentially bulking up our armed forces in in case of military action or increased Wars and it is also of course as we can expect a huge hand out to private military contractors including Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman those are the two major private industries or companies I should say that will profit the most from this NDAA and I'll tell you how in just a minute okay and Trump has goofy quotes we'll get to that in a second as well they're always amusing and dispiriting to watch because he's the president god help us okay but before we do that let me be clear this is impractical we can't afford it and no one has ever bothered to explain how the united states government running trillions of dollars in in debt and in fact now the deficits back up to over a trillion dollars as every republican president brings it to a trillion dollars bush did now Trump is every Democratic president lowers it every a Republican president increases it would they tell us it's impractical to get health care for the average American to get better wages for the average American but when they spend like drunken sailors or in the Defense Department everybody's like yeah Bravo Robert Trump brag how easy it was to pass this bill in fact Congress added things Trump didn't even one why because they don't get bribed they get legally bribed by the defense contractors who take almost all the money so I am opposed to parts of this budget that are a portion for a war because it is I'm afraid they're going to use it and I am I objected that morally and strategically for this country I think it'll be a nightmare but even if they didn't allocate money for war and I know what they say oh it's just in case of emergency like when we're Australian to say we're gonna bomb Iran within a month and just in case wink whatever even if you believe that but I also object to the heart of the defense spending so does that mean we should have no defense spending no what a preposterous thing mainstream media they drive me crazy man whenever it's something that helps you impractical no way whatever it's the defense is like black and white world oh so you want our enemies to just come into the country and kill us all no I want to suspend a reasonable amount of money on defense we out spend the top eight other countries combined in military spending right why do we have to do that we don't have to do that we choose to do that to enrich those defense contractors that bribe almost all of our politicians yes that's exactly right and as I mentioned before and I'll say it again Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman those are the two corporations that will profit the most from this bill that Trump just signed so the bill follows the administration's request for 77 f-35 fighter jets and goes beyond the administration's request for Navy ships authorizing a total of 13 new vessels it's unclear whether or not these new vessels will cost as much as Betsy divorces yachts but we do know that they are pricey and they will profit these private corporations now the bill also gives troops this is the good part a 2.6 percent pay raise and that is the highest in nine years I am happy they're getting a pay raise very often there's a lot of talk about helping our troops or helping our vets and usually nothing really gets done on their behalf in this case there's a small pay raise I wish it was more but yeah yeah so first we are fair on this show and we deal in facts so that's the highest pay raise in nine years great that I do not object to that portion of the defense bill at all in fact I would quadruple it I would do a ten percent pay raise for our troops you want to support the troops don't put a ribbon on your car give him a real pay raise like all Americans they are way under pain you know how much people come in to Armed Forces and get paid a lot of the people are coming to the Armed Forces again initially $19,000 oh my god okay that's it they've never risking their lives you want to give them a 10% pay raise I'm all in you want to build nonsense of weapons we're never ever going to use so that executives that defense contractors get rich get a thousand times bigger salary probably even more than the actual troops that risk their lives do any of those executives resterilize know they cash the checks so you want to apportion us up a bit more for the troops and less for the defense companies great but they're never gonna do that because the troops don't bribe people those executives do now Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in Fort Drum New York in front of members of the military there were members of Congress there as well and there were portions of his speech that stood out to me personally that I wanted to share with you all in case you hadn't seen it with that said let's take a look at the first clip the National Defense Authorization Act is the most significant investment in our military and our warfighters in modern history and i am very proud to be a big big part of it it was not very hard you know I went to Congress I said let's do it we got to do it we're going to strengthen our military like never ever before and that's what we did I love that part because yeah of course of course Congress had no problem with it these these corporations Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman fund our politicians like crazy of course they're going to be in favor of it yeah I mean look he's such a fool so it was easy like he says it like it was he was so good at making a deal why do you think it was easy you schmuck and what are you bragging about it was easy because they all get donations from these guys that's why it was easy so I went there and it turns out it was easy yeah so no but there's more there's more okay just one more thing Anna story the second part is we built the military like it's never been before no our military has been number one for what it's worth and since I've been alive right so it's not like over the poor US military we just weren't spending enough on it but now because of Donald Trump now yes he's kicked it up a notch a totally unnecessary notch that totally wastes our taxpayer dollars as Eisenhower said be careful the military-industrial complex every dollar you spend on weapons is a dollar you don't spend on your kids education or food for your family that's what Eisenhower a Republican president that won World War two said Trump said it was easy I built it like it's never been built before loser idiot okay so in the next clip he brags about our military capability including our weapons the National Defense Authorization Act paves the way for another 1,700 listen to this now so we've been trying to get money they never gave us money for the military for years and years and it was depleted we got 700 billion dollars and next year already approved we have 716 billion dollars to give you the finest planes and ships and tanks and missiles anywhere on earth nobody makes them like we do and very very far distant in this case jobs are very important in all cases but in this case military might is more important than even jobs so I want to just give you a little more context into his talking points regarding jobs so there was a lot of bragging about how he's increased you know jobs in America even though jobs have been increasing over the last nine years meaning that it started under Obama but nonetheless I don't want to get into all that I'm like why does he keep talking about jobs jobs jobs jobs and I noticed it was subtle he was referencing the jobs that will be created by building more weapons new weapons updated weapons I mean that's a huge part of the US economy we have this dependence on perpetual war because perpetual war means that we have to keep spending our hard-earned taxpayer money on this war machine on the military-industrial complex the thing is other other presidents don't mention that in speeches or at least they're way more subtle about it Trump can't help himself he's like yeah we're gonna create more jobs yeah more war more jobs it's kind of incredible and it's not just more war for us it's more war across the world which we encourage and incentivize because it makes us more money so he apparently went talking to other countries he does very little homework this is another story out today in the news but the one thing that he'll ask about is how much they spend in buying our weapons okay so if you're Saudi Arabia you can destroy Yemen create the worst humanitarian crisis that the world has seen certainly right now it's the worst there is and trumple help you and Trump will brag about yes but I was sadder Arabia bought a lot of our weapons yeah but what did they do with them they murdered this civilians with them yeah but they we made money me and my friends made money oh it's so so final part of this speech that I want to show you guys had to do with Trump's juvenile behavior he can't help himself when it comes to that either after bragging about the low unemployment rate in the United States here's what he had to say we've created almost four million new jobs since the election a number that the media in the back would never have said would be possible if during the campaign I'm so proud of myself I didn't call him the fake news media I didn't call I said to myself I will not today in front of our great armed forces call them fake news we know the real truth but we won't say it today you just said it like eight I know I know I mean but that's what he meant to do it's just like what a child yeah what an unbelievable child so this buffoon is the President of the United States but to be fair two things to be fair one is on this show we have said the economy in terms of the unemployment numbers is doing well it's slowing down a little bit but overall it has maintained the trend that was started 93 months ago okay so anyone who tells you that Trump started is a liar period period he didn't start it but he also didn't crash it now I think yet I think he unfortunately is creating a stock market boat but that doesn't happen yet and if it doesn't happen then I'll say at the end of four years hey man he maintained the the low unemployment numbers and that's real and that's a big deal now I think wages are too low but they were to outlaw under Obama so I'm being fair about that part of the record ok but when it comes to you know the his antics he just you know a can't help himself by attacking the media one bit that isn't it theoretically this press conference is supposed to be about our troops right but it's got to be about Trump it's got to be about Trump and and so it's deeply frustrating and and the reality is that news media applauds you think that they are against you on the defense budget no I just read an analysis that shows the media has reported negatively on Donald Trump overwhelmingly why I think it's because he totally deserves it okay but the one area where the press by a margin of four to one gave him positive coverage was when he bombed Syria that's right then they were all fawning like Oh Bravo Donald Trump way to potentially start another war launch bombs Bravo no so they're gonna tell you the same they did it with this budget who's going around are any anchors on cable news going can we afford this can we afford this every time a progressive goes on air can we afford higher wages for real Americans you know how dare you can we afford the American dream your kids getting college education not one anchor asking if they we can afford this chink look to be fair the military is there to keep us safe from national security risks and threats so we can die here in the United States with a lack of health care coverage you know I mean like really think about that for a second the whole point of the military is to protect the country what good is it to protect the country if Americans don't have what's necessary to stay alive and thrive yes so if you're looking to protect our lives for God's sake give us health care
