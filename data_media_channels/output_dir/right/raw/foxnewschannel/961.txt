THE JOURNALIST.

>> IT MAY HAVE COST ME THE

00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:50,247
ELECTION BUT I STAND BY EVERY

21
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:52,315
ONE OF THOSE DECISIONS TO

22
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:56,720
DISAGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT.

23
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,888

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,360
WELCOME.

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,295
MARK SANFORD HAS NEVER LOST AN

27
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:05,762
ELECTION BEFORE.

28
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:09,066
>> THAT IS RIGHT.

29
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:09,933
>> Shannon: THIS GUY HAS BEEN

30
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:12,936
A WINNER THROUGH ALL KINDS OF

31
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:13,437
TUMULTUOUS THINGS.

32
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:16,139
>> HE WAS A WINNER AFTER A

33
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:18,275
PERIOD AFTER HE WENT DARK,

34
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:19,743
STEPPED BACK FROM PUBLIC LIFE

35
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:21,878
AFTER HE RESIGNED THE

36
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:23,080
GOVERNORSHIP.

37
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,980
BLOW UP SOUTH CAROLINA POLITICS.

38
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,782
THIS WAS A GUY ON TRACK TO RUN

39
00:01:25,782 --> 00:01:26,450
FOR PRESIDENT.

40
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,885
HE WOULD'VE BEEN A GREAT PICK IF

41
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:32,122
YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE FIELD

42
00:01:32,122 --> 00:01:32,556
FOR 2012.

43
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:34,925
HE WOULD'VE BEEN A GREAT PICK

44
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:35,726
UNTIL HE EXPLODED HIS CAREER.

45
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:38,795
THEN HE CAME BACK WITH A LOT OF

46
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:40,530
HUMILITY, A LOT OF DEFERENCE AND

47
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,598
SINCERE APOLOGY.

48
00:01:41,598 --> 00:01:42,966
VOTERS GAVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE.

49
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:44,768
WHAT HE FOUND OUT WAS HE HAD A

50
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:45,569
SHORT LEASH.

51
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:48,171
THAT MEANT ANY CRITICISM OF THE

52
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:49,539
PRESIDENT, ANY BUCKING THE PARTY

53
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:52,576
LINE, THIS IS A GUY WHO'S VERY

54
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:53,009
CONSERVATIVE.

55
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,145
MEGA CONSERVATIVE.

56
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:56,146
THE GUYS ON THE FREEDOM CAUCUS

57
00:01:56,146 --> 00:02:00,383
LIKE HIM.

58
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:01,418
THE LIBERTARIAN LEADERS LIKE

59
00:02:01,418 --> 00:02:01,685
HIM.

60
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:05,455
THE VERDICT HERE WAS BECAUSE OF

61
00:02:05,455 --> 00:02:07,657
HIS BAGGAGE, AND SHE WENT RIGHT

62
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:09,493
AFTER HIS BAGGAGE AND HER ADS,

63
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:10,494
MADE A LOT OF HIS AFFAIR AND

64
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:11,161
SCANDAL.

65
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:12,496
SHE WENT AFTER THAT IN ADDITION

66
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:15,532
TO THE POINTS HE'S DISAGREED

67
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:16,967
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

68
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:17,734
>> Shannon: PRESIDENT TRUMP

69
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:19,102
FIGURED INTO A RACE IN VIRGINIA

70
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:20,036
WERE COREY STEWART, IT LOOKS

71
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:24,341
LIKE, GOING TO BE THE G.O.P.

72
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:27,878
NOMINEE AGAINST TIM KAINE IN THE

73
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:28,178
FALL.

74
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:29,980
THE AP DESCRIBED COREY STEWART

75
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,414
"HE CAMPAIGNED LAST YEAR ON

76
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:33,316

IMMIGRANT HARD-LINER.

79

"THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO

80
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:42,559
LOVE HIM.

81
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,260
THAT'S WHY THEY VOTED FOR HIM.

82
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,763
THIS LINES UP WITH WHERE THE

83
00:02:46,763 --> 00:02:47,164
PRESIDENT'S.

84
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:48,198
HE'S BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE

85
00:02:48,198 --> 00:02:48,765
PRESIDENT.

86
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:50,367
HE GOT IN TROUBLE WHEN HE WAS

87
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:52,402
COCHAIRING THE STATE CAMPAIGN.

88
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:55,739
HE DECIDED TO HAVE THE

DEMONSTRATION IN FRONT OF THE

90
00:02:57,741 --> 00:03:02,345
RNC OFFICE.

91
00:03:02,345 --> 00:03:04,414
FOLKS SAYING THEY WONDER HOW

92
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:06,183
IT'S GONNA PLAY BROADLY.

93
00:03:06,183 --> 00:03:07,150
AND DOWN TO GET IN VIRGINIA.

94
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,954
>> REPUBLICAN TURNOUT IN

95
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:12,055
VIRGINIA WAS SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW

96
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:13,957
WHERE IT WAS LAST YEAR THE

97
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:14,958
PRIMARY.

98
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:15,859
COREY STEWART WAS TRYING TO TAKE

99
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:18,929
ON ED GILLESPIE.

100
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:20,063
COREY STEWART ISN'T GOING TO BE

00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:22,432
A BIG PART OF HELPING TURN

102

VIRGINIA BLUE.

103
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:26,570
IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE HIS SUPPORT

104
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,371
CAME FROM, HOW FEW PEOPLE TURNED

105
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:30,173
OUT TO VOTE, AND IF YOU LOOK AT

106
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:32,375
HIS MESSAGE AND YOU LOOK AT HIS

107
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,109
PERFORMANCE IN THESE NORTHERN

108
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:35,345
COUNTIES IN VIRGINIA, HE IS OUT

109
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:35,745
OF STEP.

110
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:36,479
WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO TRY

111
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,950
TO DO.

112
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,817
THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE

113

COREY STEWART THE FACE OF THE

114
00:03:43,687 --> 00:03:44,521
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

115
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:48,892
THAT WILL PUT THE NATIONAL

116
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:49,292
REPUBLICANS.

117
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:51,494
THERE WILL BE A SPLIT.

118
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:53,029
THEY DON'T WANT TO SAY THEY

119
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:56,132
DISAVOW COREY STEWART BUT AT THE

120
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:57,400

DO YOU THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN?

124
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:03,373
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING

125
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:04,007
TO HAPPEN.

126
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:05,575
I WOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU HE WAS

127
00:04:05,575 --> 00:00:00,000
GOING TO HAVE A BILATERAL SUMMIT
