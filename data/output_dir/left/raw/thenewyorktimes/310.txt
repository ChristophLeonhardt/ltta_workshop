1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,609
“Five quads planned.

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:05,650
He will be opening
with the quad flip.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,620
He’s going to do a
second quad flip here.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,890
Here’s a quad toe,
it looks like.

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,280
Another one.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:11,990
Why not?

7
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,860
Number five.

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,570
Yes.”

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,060
“I will have to literally
do my dream program,

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,270
be super, super clean,
hit all of my quads.

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,860
You just have to
set your mind right.

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,420
You have to make sure that you
know what you’re attempting.

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,128
And then you also need
to know how you’re

14
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:36,694
going to do it perfectly.”

15
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,700
“Nathan Chen’s body type
is ideal for quads.

16
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,100
He’s very slim from head to toe.

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,380
He’s got a great
bounce to his knee,

18
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,240
and his hips are very closed.

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,640
So he’s not overly
flexible simply

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,540
because if you think
about aerodynamics,

21
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,420
the sewing needle
is going to spin

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,988
a lot faster than a pumpkin.”

23
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,580
“When he burst onto the scene
to the masses just a couple

24
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,250
of seasons ago, people
were really down on him

25
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,060
for his artistry.

26
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,270
And I always found his
carriage, his arm positioning,

27
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,150
the way that he emotes and
presents to an audience,

28
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,810
to be very balletic,
very classically trained.”

29
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,380
“As I kind of
progressed into ballet,

30
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,750
I started to understand
the concept of the art

31
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,710
and how pretty and beautiful
all the movement is.

32
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,430
And that definitely
correlates to figure

33
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,410
skating in terms of where you
need to position your body,

34
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,880
how are you going to
position lines, how you’re

35
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,213
going to make yourself look
good, while making it sort of

36
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:07,220
look effortless.”

37
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,180
“This is a sport that has all
these wonderful technical

38
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,510
elements.

39
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,620
But they’re performed to music.

40
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,570
They’re done as an
entire composition.

41
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:22,606
So it really is artistry on
ice with athletic feats within.”

42
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,177
“It really is like a moment of
zen when I’m doing my program.

43
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,260
There’s a hush in my body.

44
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,176
I don’t hear anything.

45
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:44,170
I don’t really feel much.

46
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,560
Occasionally I’ll just notice
certain colors or smells.

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,542
I just let myself kind
of go on auto drive.

48
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,610
If I do make a
mistake in my program,

49
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,060
I can really quickly
calculate how much

50
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,670
energy that I have to
redo a certain element.

51
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,320
For instance, if I
fall on a quad lutz,

52
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,090
do I have the energy to
do another quad lutz later

53
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,630
in the program?

54
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,588
Do I have an energy to
replace that with a toe?

55
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:09,204
Do I have the energy to
just let all that go and do

56
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:10,120
a triple lutz instead?”

57
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,680
“It’s all very complicated.

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,990
But bottom line is
that the judging system

59
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,760
has gone so far into
‘mathletics’ and adding up

60
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,520
all of the elements that you’re
doing that the art of figure

61
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,730
skating is lost.

62
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,900
But if Nathan Chen
does five or six quads,

63
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,960
blows the roof off the
arena in Pyeongchang,

64
00:04:39,960 --> 00:00:00,000
who knows what can happen?”
