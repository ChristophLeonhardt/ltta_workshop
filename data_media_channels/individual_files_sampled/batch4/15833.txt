what do you think of that question there I say again it's being asked of a foreign citizen who the first actus can come to Canada illegally and this is just in the same couple of weeks as illegal refugees who come in and terror in Canada Omar Sharif and just last week a Canadian terrorist pled guilty to a plot in New York so yeah illegal border crossers deliberately breaking the law non-citizens I feel good that someone is at least asking some questions even if they're not backed up with any teeth even if no one's deported even if it's all a sham at least someone is pretending can I hang off of that well no actually the screaming headline in the Toronto Star today RCMP officers scream Quebec border crossers on religion and values question air shows and then if you see the headline a sub-headline there and RCMP guide for screening asylum seekers includes several questions that appear to target Muslims when asked about the questionnaire the spokesman spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told the Starr the RCMP had suspended its use well you should note that the word Muslim appears nowhere in the questionnaire it just doesn't I read it the word Islamic does but only because that's part of the name Islamic state the world's leading terrorist group that's what they call themselves the Arabic language words I use word to describe face obscuring the cabs and his jabs those aren't prescribed by the Koran they're just Arabic words for those garments they're actually not even essential to Islam they're a political expression of radical Islam and the questionnaire just ask people their views on them and if they accept Canada's liberal values of equality for women Muslims can say yes to that or they can say no aren't you curious what kind were importing so what though doesn't Justin Trudeau drone on every single day about what a feminist he is but is that only to lecture Canadians like you and me and to accuse us subtly of being sexist shouldn't we tell new Canadians would be Canadians especially lawbreakers that's what we're about because no one is you know no one's telling them remember this Syrian refugee so famous that a documentary was made about him when he was convicted of beating his wife for half an hour with a hockey stick in Atlantic Canada literally told the court that no one in Justin Trudeau's Canada ever told him the beating your wife with a stick was against the law here and I actually believe him on that that feminist lecturing is only for folks like you and me not like by barians not for barbarians like him Ralph Goodale ripped up the questionnaire says the star and I believe them here's what his assistant wrote to the newspaper quote the minute we became aware of the interview guide we were immediately concerned and contacted the RCMP largely wrote some of the questions were inappropriate and inconsistent with government policy really is it inappropriate to talk about the Equality of men and women Justin Trudeau won't shut up about it a view like that sign up for my show every day click on the screen to subscribe you
