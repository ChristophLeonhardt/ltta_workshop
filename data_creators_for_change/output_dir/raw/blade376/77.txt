1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,429
I got a haircut naturally curly I had

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:04,380
band practice that is why my voice might

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,839
sound a bit hoarse there's no horse

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,970
there today no pun when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I first started</font>

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,099
using Twitter I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my profile</font>

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,320
page to be a neat list of tweets but

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,509
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not how it works I'm using it</font>

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,310
like crazy now so if you ever have

9
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,199
anything you want to ask me directly at

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,420
miles Dyer is it water or vodka vodka

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,150
anyway today I want to talk about ideas

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,820
especially ones we believe are good

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,460
because it's these ideas that we tell

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,620
others you may find you sometimes come

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,719
across people who like to well not

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,360
necessarily like<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it can be</font>

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,579
unintentional but people who just

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,579
discouraged and there's a particular

19
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,260
phrase I've heard throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life</font>

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">what if it was a good idea we'd be doing</font>

21
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,829
it already I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just find that really</font>

22
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,500
unhelpful and in this video I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,820
tell you exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> why that is</font>

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,760
so why do I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> this phrase is</font>

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,970
unhelpful well firstly and this is an

26
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,060
obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> one it's not constructive at all</font>

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,000
how is anyone going to get anything out

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,480
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> phrase other than feeling</font>

29
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">disheartened about suggesting that idea</font>

30
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,470
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two really clear</font>

31
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,200
examples of why this phrase is redundant

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
the first is about when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I studied</font>

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,650
psychology at<font color="#E5E5E5"> University during one of</font>

34
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,950
our courses we learnt<font color="#E5E5E5"> about human</font>

35
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,900
attention span and that if we were ever

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,050
to efficiently learn information that we

37
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,180
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it in 20 to 30 minute</font>

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,940
blocks our lectures were two hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font>

39
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,369
so what am I getting at well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

40
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,040
understand why psychology lecturers

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,690
don't practice what they preach if

42
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,400
they're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about this</font>

43
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,650
legitimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> research why don't they break</font>

44
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,110
up lectures into<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 30 minute segments</font>

45
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,410
with short breaks in between they'll get

46
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,570
more out of their students they'll get

47
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,270
better results and they look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

48
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,909
hypocrites really but this is an example

49
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,950
of a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that hasn't been done yet</font>

50
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the second example I want to talk</font>

51
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,090
about is my experiences with my job of

52
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,880
being a<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube marketing Jedi okay so</font>

53
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,800
where I work we have a sales team and

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,140
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go out to advertisers and</font>

55
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,450
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make them run their adverts</font>

56
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,180
across our network and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube as a</font>

57
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,820
whole as pre-roll and<font color="#E5E5E5"> true view we say</font>

58
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,980
look we can run your advert across the

59
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,340
web cross<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube and guarantee for</font>

60
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,620
example a million<font color="#E5E5E5"> views guarantee a</font>

61
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,410
million views have it aimed at a

62
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,420
particular demographic whether it's

63
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,549
based on keywords and interests whether

64
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:46,620
it's based on gender whether it's based

65
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,610
on age or geographical location we can

66
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,700
do all that and have much better

67
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,880
engagement than<font color="#E5E5E5"> television ads where</font>

68
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,680
people usually go make a cup of tea when

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,620
the adverts are on or skip it and it

70
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be cheaper than running the ads on</font>

71
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,349
TV and with all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind they'll</font>

72
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:10,230
go now which go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to TV and there's even</font>

73
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that say what companies are</font>

74
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,280
was motivated by the profit<font color="#CCCCCC"> margin well</font>

75
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously not because they would have</font>

76
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,210
made more profit and had better

77
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,580
efficiency doing it this way but they

78
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,860
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> go with that good idea because</font>

79
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">they haven't evolved with the culture</font>

80
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">yet you know online video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

81
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,660
monetization on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube is still pretty</font>

82
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,090
new so<font color="#E5E5E5"> once again a good idea that in</font>

83
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,190
many cases hasn't been done yet well if

84
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,630
it was a good idea we'd be doing it

85
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,910
already can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine how backwards</font>

86
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,510
society would be today if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we lived by</font>

87
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,940
that rhetoric I mean imagine a caveman

88
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,370
who first came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with fire I'm being</font>

89
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,980
really cartoony here and yeah it's not

90
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,900
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best example but bear with me he</font>

91
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be like oh look I found fire which</font>

92
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,000
can cook food which can keep us warm and

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,460
some other caveman would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well to</font>

94
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">be quite frank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think if that was a</font>

95
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,480
good idea we would be doing it already I

96
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,210
suggest you put that fire out<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be pure</font>

97
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,580
insanity so finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

98
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,560
ever come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas and you hear</font>

99
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,110
people throw that rhetoric your way if

100
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,450
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not constructive don't be</font>

101
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,180
disheartened keep going and share your

102
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,779
ideas with those that actually will give

103
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,550
you decent feedback as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you learn</font>

104
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,280
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it can lead to bigger and better</font>

105
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,070
things and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd always keep the faith</font>

106
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,500
and always keep striving for learning

107
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,419
more and sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas with others</font>

108
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,910
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how society will continue</font>

109
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,660
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow and prosper say thank you for</font>

110
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,310
watching I look forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hearing your</font>

111
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,470
thoughts and your ideas if you have any

112
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,490
to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a ds2 next time</font>

113
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:54,729
I had an idea which didn't turn out too

114
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:57,039
well not only has it not been hung

115
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,130
properly in this example but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a</font>

116
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,199
reflection from the light it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

117
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">work so if you want to help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

118
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:07,180
wall look cool I have a p.o box which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

119
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,039
linked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the description please send me</font>

120
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,060
any artwork you have made that

121
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,860
communicates how you feel about my

122
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,590
videos and what you have learnt and I'd

123
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">love to put it up so look forward to</font>

124
