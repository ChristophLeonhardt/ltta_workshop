Neil: WE ARE GETTING WORD, I KID YOU NOT, THAT NBA STAR TURNED KIM JONG UN SOULMATE DENNIS RODMAN WILL BE IN SINGAPORE AHEAD OF THE PRESIDENT SUMMIT WITH THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR. IN FACT, HE MIGHT BE PART OF THIS ONGOING PROCESS. WHEN I THINK OF WHO COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HECK THIS MEANS, I GO TO MY BUDDY, MY GOOD FRIEND FOR SO MANY YEARS, CHARLES PAYNE FOR SO MANY YEARS, CHARLES PAYN CHARLES PAYNE. WHAT THE HECK? PETER NAVARRO IS OUT OR WILBUR ROSS. NOW WE KNOW WE HAVE A DEAL. SOUNDS LIKE A PUBLICITY STUNT. BETTER WAY TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON THAT BUT IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE IS HAVING A GOOD TIME. HE'S GOING TO GET A LOT OF PUBLICITY. MAYBE IF HE IS WEARING A PAIR OF SKETCHERS. Neil: ONE OF THE FEW AMERICANS WHO HAS AN ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG UN. PRESIDENT PROBABLY CAN USE ALL THE PRESS HE CAN GET. THE PRESSURE IS ON, THE TIMETABLE IS ON. IT'S ONE DAY. KIM JONG UN WENT TO SCHOOL IN THE WEST. HE OBVIOUSLY ADMIRED WESTERN CULTURE INCLUDING BASKETBALL. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THE OLYMPICS A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THE OLYMPIC OLYMPICS, GOING AND WATCHING WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAYBE, JUST MAYBE HE DOES WANT SOMETHING FOR HIS PEOPLE. I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BELIEVE THAT ALL SOULS BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE THESE OVERTURES ABOUT HARDWORKING NORTH KOREANS, ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO POUR IN FROM CHINA, JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA. HE'S MADE HIS OVERTURE MANY TIMES. MAYBE SOMEONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE BELIEVES ALSO IT'S ANOTHER STRONG NEGOTIATING POINT. Neil: WHAT YOU SAID IS DEEP AND PROFOUND. WHAT YOU ARE MISSING IS MAYBE HE JUST WANTS SOME FAST FOOD OUT OF IT. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS. YOU CAN GET DONALD'S, KFC, YOU CAN GET IT ALL. GET YOU A STARBUCKS. WE CAN THROW IT ALL IN THERE. BUT WAIT. THERE'S MORE. Neil: THE OWNER STILL SEEMED TO BE HONEST TO PROVIDE A LOT OF MONEY. THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY MADE CLEAR, AND LOWERED EXPECTATIONS. DON'T EXPECT US TO SORT OF BEADY SUGAR DADDY DADDY HERE. BUT I AM WONDERING WHAT WE WOULD OFFER FOR THE KINGDOM TO START DENUCLEARIZING. I HAVE ASKED THAT QUESTION OF ALL THE EXPERTS AND NOT HAVE GIVE ME AN ANSWER. THERE IS NO DOUBT THE NUKES ARE NORTH KOREANS, THEIR CURRENTLY THEY HAVE. THEY MAKE A FEW BUCKS FAKING BRONZE STATUES FOR OTHER DICTATORS BUT BESIDES THAT, IT'S THE ONLY CURRENCY THEY HAVE TO GIVE THAT UP YOU NEED A COMBINATION OF A GUARANTEED SAFETY AND MAJOR ECONOMIC INCENTIVES. IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG NUMBER. I THINK THE WORLD WOULD SAY THE NUMBER CAN'T BE TOO BIG IF YOU GET RID OF THE DANGEROUS WEAPONS. Neil: OFFERING TO BUY UP AGRICULTURAL GOODS FROM US, NOT MUCH REACTION. THAT WOULD BE QUITE A COUP FOR THE PRESIDENT FOR IT TO PASS. I THINK A LOT OF OTHER PRESIDENTS WOULD'VE TAKEN IT, RAN WITH THE BALL, AND DECLARE VICTORY. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PLAYING A STRONG, TOUGH GAME. I THINK IT'S A GOOD OVERTURE AND I THINK HE THREW OUT SOME LARGER NUMBERS BUT 70 BILLION IS HUGE. MAYBE IT WILL WORK ON THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HEAR SOME SORT OF MEMBER OF $100 BILLION TALKED ABOUT, PROBABLY A COMBINATION OF LOWER TARIFFS AND THE ABILITY TO OPEN UP THEIR MARKETS. YOU NEED SOMETHING ON THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE.
