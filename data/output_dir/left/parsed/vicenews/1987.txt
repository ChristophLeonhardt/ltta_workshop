I'm Simon Ostrovsky in this week on the
line we're discussing Europe's migrant
crisis in the Mediterranean tens of
thousands of people are trying to leave
Africa shores to get to the European
Union and a lot of them are drowning on
the way one American millionaire is
trying to do something about it so we're
gonna be discussing whether it's up to
private individuals or governments to
rescue people at sea with the
government's not doing anything private
individuals are coming into the picture
and they're already planning their
expansion if you have a question for us
send it via twitter with the hashtag on
the line or send vice news a skype video
