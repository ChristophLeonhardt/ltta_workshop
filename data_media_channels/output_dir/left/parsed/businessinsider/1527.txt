gennifer flowers will not be attending
the debate tomorrow night and Donald

really to mock effort by Hillary Clinton
in her campaign to really distract
attention from worthy of people are the
American people are going to be focused
tomorrow night we would frown upon mr.
Cuban being in front row if his purpose
is to somehow disrupt the debate
likewise if mr. Trump was going to put
something in the front row to try to
impact things
