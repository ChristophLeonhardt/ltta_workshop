1
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:09,975
>> THE DISGRACE, WHAT THIS

2
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:10,609
MAN HAS DONE.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,444
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:12,778
TEXAS --

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,246
>> I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,317
MANY TIMES DID YOU LOOK SO

7
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,952
INNOCENT INTO YOUR WIFE'S

8
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,987
EYE AND LIE TO HER ABOUT

9
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:22,354
LISA PAGE.

10
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,758
>> OH, MR. CHAIRMAN, IT'S

11
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:26,158
OUTRAGEOUS.

12
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,294
>> SHAME ON YOU,

13
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:28,694
MR. GOHMERT.

14
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,532
>> THIS SIN TOLERABLE

15
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,199
HARASSMENT OF THE WITNESS.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,267
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT

17
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,936
YOU NEED YOUR MEDICATION.

18
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,772
A LITTLE BIT LATER

19
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,472
CONGRESSMAN GOHMERT DID SAY

20
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,874
HE DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THIS.

21
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,242
HE LOST HIS TEMPER WHEN HE

22
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,443
SAW THE LOOK ON HIS FACES A

23
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,945
IF HE WAS PUTTING SOMETHING

24
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,646
OVER ON ALL THE CONGRESSMAN

25
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:51,951
MEN AND WOMEN.

00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:52,851
STEVE: DIAMOND AND SILK

27
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:53,786
TRUMP SUPPORTERS.

28
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,621
THEY JOIN US EVERY FRIDAY

29
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,522
FROM DIAMOND AND SILK

30
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:56,956
HEADQUARTERS.

31
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,958
LADIES, WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF

32
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,560
LOUIE GOHMERT'S COMMENT?

33
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,928
WAS HE OVER THE LINE WITH

34
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,430
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID HE

35
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:04,763
WAS.

36
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:05,831
WHAT DID YOU THINK GENERALLY

37
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,600
OF YESTERDAY'S 10-HOUR

38
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:07,967
GRILLING.

39
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,435
>> I THINK HIS COMMENT WAS

40
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:09,835
APPROPRIATE.

41
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:10,169
>> YES.

42
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,670
>> LISTEN, WE ARE TRYING TO

43
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:12,538
GET DOWN TO ANSWERS TO

44
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:12,838
FACTS.

45
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:13,939
WE WANT TO KNOW DOES THIS

46
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,740
MAN HAVE BIAS.

47
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,475
WERE YOU TRYING TO TAKE DOWN

48
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,810
A SITTING PRESIDENT OR WERE

49
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:21,213
PRESIDENT.

50
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,214
THIS RUSSIA COLLUSION STORY

51
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,382
THAT WAS MANUFACTURED BY YOU

52
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,183
WAS A LIE.

53
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,186
YESTERDAY, I THOUGHT THAT

54
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,287
PETER STRZOK SHOULD HAVE

55
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,722
BEEN TAKEN OUT IN HANDCUFFS.

56
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:31,423
THEY SHOULD HAVE ARRESTED

57
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:31,690
HIM.

58
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:35,728
YOU KNOW IF THIS WAS DONE TO

59
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:36,895
OBAMA OUR SYSTEM WOULD HAVE

60
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:37,696
BROKE LOOSE.

61
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,165
I WONDER IF DEMOCRATS WOULD

62
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,434
BE SINGING HIS PRAISES IF

63
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,335
PETER STRZOK HAD DONE THIS

64
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:45,871
ANSWERS NOW.

65
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,206
>> IF THIS WAS SO PERSONAL

66
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,108
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE ON

67
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,709
A PERSONAL PHONE AND NOT A

68
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,946
CONSERVATIVES WERE NOT HAPPY

69
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,813
WITH HIM YESTERDAY THAT WAS

70
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,782
CLEAR IN HIS QUESTIONING.

71
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,850
DEMOCRATS, MANY OF THEM WERE

72
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,951
DEFENDING HIM.

73
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,586
ONE EVEN SAID HE DESERVES A

74
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,186
PURPLE HEART.

75
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:01,820
LISTEN TO.

76
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,322
THIS I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO

77
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,556
YOU FOR THE WAY YOU HAVE

78
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:05,591
BEEN TREATED BY THIS

79
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:05,958
COMMITTEE.

80
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,863
THEIR SIDE, THEY RESORT TO

81
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:11,530
ATTACKING LAW ENFORCEMENT.

82
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,998
THAT'S WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING

83
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:13,399
NOW.

84
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,669
>> THIS INVESTIGATION IS A

85
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:16,969
JOKE.

86
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,174
COURT.

87
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,811
IT IS A THREE RING CIRCUS.

88
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,413
>> WE SHOULD BE HONORING YOU

89
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,480
FOR THE WORK HAVE YOU DONE

90
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,218
>> IF I COULD GIVE YOU A

91
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,787
PURPLE HEART, I WOULD.

92
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,623
YOU DESERVE ONE.

93
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,525
AINSLEY: DIAMOND AND SILK,

94
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,893
WHO IS RIGHT IN THIS?

95
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,428
>> FIRST OF ALL, I FIND THE

96
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,829
HYPOCRISY ON THE LEFT IS

97
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,263
UNBELIEVABLE.

98
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:44,596
>> YEAH.

99
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:45,798
>> LET ME TELL YOU

100
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:46,699
SOMETHING, THIS MAN TEXTS

101
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,100
HOW HE WANTED TO TAKE DOWN

102
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,103
DONALD TRUMP.

103
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,638
HAD YOU HE WANTED TO STOP

104
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,905
HIM.

105
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,640
WE ARE SITTING UP IN THERE

106
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,541
TRYING TO PRAISE HIM FOR

107
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,742
THAT I FIND IT APPALLING.

108
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,643
TO SAY ALL OF THE DEMOCRATS,

109
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,944
THOSE LAWMAKERS, ESPECIALLY

110
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,179
THOSE BLACK ONES, I HAVE A

111
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,814
PROBLEM WITH WHAT THEY ARE

112
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:02,147
SAYING.

113
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,182
YOU KNOW, THEY ALWAYS

114
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,917
COMPLAIN ABOUT THE INJUSTICE

115
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:09,188
OF BLACK MEN BEING

116
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,923
RAILROADED, WE HAVE A

117
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,257
SITTING PRESIDENT BEING

118
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,692
RAILROADED BY THIS FBI AGENT

119
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,160
AND BY SOME IN THE FBI AND

120
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,763
THEY ARE SITTING UP HIM I

121
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,264
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT AND

122
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,165
I'M SURE MOST AMERICANS HAVE

123
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,333
A PROBLEM WITH THAT PETER

124
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,167
STRZOK SHOULD HAVE BEEN

125
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,103
TAKEN OUT AND STEEL AROUND

126
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:24,737
HIS WRISTS.

127
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,804
EVIDENCE SHOULD BE GOING TO

128
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:26,105
JAIL.

129
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:30,576
IS HE A CRIMINAL.

130
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,243
BRIAN: HE HAD TO DENOUNCE

131
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,779
HIS OWN WORDS AND MAKE

132
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,713
EVERYONE HE DIDN'T BELIEVE

133
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,116
SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON IN

134
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:37,649
CAPITOL HILL.

135
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:45,924
YES, A CONGRESSMAN POO

136
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,359
YES, A CONGRESSMAN POCAN HAS

137
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,962
A PLAN TO ABOLISH ICE.

138
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,563
PAUL RYAN SAID THAT'S

139
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:51,964
INTERESTING.

140
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,166
LET DEMOCRATS AND

141
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,534
REPUBLICANS VOTE ON

142
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,335
ABOLISHING ICE.

143
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,469
GUESS WHAT THE CONGRESSMAN

144
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,871
GOES OH, THIS IS A TRAP.

145
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,239
YOU PUT THAT FORWARD, I'M

146
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,574
GOING TO VOTE AGAINST MY OWN

147
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:02,875
PLAN.

148
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:03,442
I DON'T GET IT.

149
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:08,914
DO YOU?

150
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,216
>> WE REALLY DON'T GET IT

151
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,251
THE DEMOCRATS DOES THIS A

152
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:12,718
WHOLE LOT.

153
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,752
THEY SAY A LOT OF THINGS

154
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,987
THEY WANT TO DO.

155
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:15,854
REALLY THEY DON'T WANT TO DO

156
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:16,121
IT.

157
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,723
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS PLAY

158
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,559
THE DEMOCRATS TALK ABOUT HOW

159
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,127
THEY WANT TO ABOLISH ICE BUT

160
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,998
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO ABOLISH

161
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:26,331
SLAVERY.

162
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,633
DEMOCRATS IS A BIG JOKE AND

163
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,534
IT'S TIME TO VOTE ALL OF

164
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,168
THEM OUT.

165
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,502
>> VOTE THEM OUT.

166
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,137
BRIAN: HAVE A CHANCE TO GET

167
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,472
A VOTE AND TURNING IT DOWN

168
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,344
NOT WANT TO ABOLISH ICE.

169
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:39,978
STEVE: LADIES, BEFORE DID

170
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:40,646
YOU GO, WHAT DID YOU THINK

171
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,581
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT -- IS HE

172
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,582
HALFWAY THROUGH HIS WORLD

173
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,583
DESTRUCTION TOUR.

174
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,854
TO GET SOME.

175
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,423
HE HAD HARSH WORDS FOR

176
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,931
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND FOR

177
00:04:58,932 --> 00:04:59,264
AMERICA.

178
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,499
WE ARE NOT WANT TO BE USED

179
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,834
AS THE CRUTCH ANYMORE.

180
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,268
AMERICA IS NOT THE WORLD'S

181
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:03,602
CRUTCH.

182
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,570
THEY HAVE TO STAND UP ON

183
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:08,540
THEIR FAIR SHARE.

184
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,409
>> OUR FIRST LADY

185
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,343
REPRESENTED AMERICA

186
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:11,743
BEAUTIFULLY.

187
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,513
SHE LOOKED AMAZING, VERY

188
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,447
STUNNING.

189
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,148
AINSLEY: THE YELLOW DRESS

190
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,216
WAS BEAUTIFUL.

191
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,617
WHAT ABOUT HIS NOMINEE FOR

192
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,152
THE SUPREME COURT ON MONDAY?

193
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,521
>> OH, WE'RE ABSOLUTELY JUST
