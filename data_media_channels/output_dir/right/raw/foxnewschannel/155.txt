1
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:05,331
THE STRONGEST SECRETARIES OF

2
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:06,532
STATE WE'VE HAD.

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:08,501
ACCORDING TO NEWS REPORTS,

4
00:00:08,502 --> 00:00:10,837
PASTOR BRONSON IS THAT 19TH

5
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:12,338
PRISONER -- PERHAPS HOSTAGES THE

6
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:14,340
RIGHT WORD FREED BY THE TRUMP

7
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:15,107
ADMINISTRATION.

8
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:16,709
HERE HE IS PRAYING WITH THE

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,677
PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE

10
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:21,914
OVER THE WEEKEND -- TAKE A LOOK.

11
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:25,284
>> I ASK THAT YOU POUR OUT YOUR

12
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:26,018
HOLY SPIRIT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP,

13
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,888
YOU GIVE HIM SUPERNATURAL WISDOM

14
00:00:28,889 --> 00:00:30,056
TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THE PLANS YOU

15
00:00:30,057 --> 00:00:34,260
HAVE FOR THIS COUNTRY.

16
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:38,498
I ASK THAT YOU GET SOME WISDOM

17
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:39,966
NOT

18
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:41,934
TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY INTO

19
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:42,368
RIGHTEOUSNESS.

20
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:43,870
>> Sean: JOINING US NOW IS

21
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:45,438
PASTOR BRONSON HIMSELF.

22
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,909
I KNOW HOW MANY WORKED ON YOUR

23
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,511
BEHALF -- YOU ARE HELD FOR 1818

24
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:54,747
MONTHS AND HAD NO REASON, NO

25
00:00:54,748 --> 00:00:55,481
UNDERSTANDING OF WHY AND WERE

26
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:58,150
HELD IN A CELL DESIGNED FOR 8

27
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:00,653
AND THERE WERE 21 PEOPLE.

28
00:01:00,654 --> 00:01:02,522
CORRECT?

29
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:05,291
>> PART OF THAT GAME IT WAS VERY

30
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:09,262
CROWDED IN THAT CELL.

31
00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:13,699
IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME.

32
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,568
I WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE I HAD

33
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:16,936
NEVER CONSIDERED PRISON AS A

34
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:18,704
POSSIBILITY AND THE COSTS FOR

35
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:19,105
THAT.

36
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:21,908
>> Sean: HOW WERE YOU TREATED?

37
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:22,909
>> I WAS TREATED WELL BY THE

38
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,945
PRISONERS I WAS WITH.

39
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:27,680
>> Sean: THEY WERE NOT OF YOUR

40
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:27,980
FAITH.

41
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:29,415
>> THEY WEREN'T AND THAT WAS ONE

42
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:32,518
OF THE DIFFICULT THINGS.

43
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,521
I WAS ISOLATED BY CULTURE AND BY

44
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:36,722
LANGUAGE BUT ESPECIALLY BY

45
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:37,089
RELIGION.

46
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:37,890
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO BE THE

47
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:40,693
ONLY CHRISTIAN AMONG THEM.

48
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:41,360
>> Sean: WHEN YOU FOUND OUT

49
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:42,795
WHAT YOU WERE BEING HELD FOR

50
00:01:42,796 --> 00:01:43,829
WHICH WAS YOUR FAITH, WHAT DID

51
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,533
YOU THINK?

52
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:48,834
>> WHAT WAS SURPRISING IS THAT

53
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:51,938
THEY TOLD ME I WAS BEING HELD

54
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:52,805
FOR TERRORISM AND FOR TRYING TO

55
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:54,907
OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT.

56
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:57,009
THE TRUTH IS IF WE HAD BEEN

57
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,113
PREACHING JESUS CHRIST -- THAT'S

58
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:03,149
WHY WE WERE IN TURKEY -- IS TO

59
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,117
SHARE THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST

60
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:05,518
WITH TURKS.

61
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,153
WE DID THAT OPENLY AND NEVER HAD

62
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:07,720
A PROBLEM.

63
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:09,055
IT WAS VERY SHOCKING TO BE

64
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:13,292
ACCUSED OF TERRORISM.

65
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:15,428
>> AND IT CAME DOWN TO YOUR

66
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:17,496
CHRISTIAN FAITH IN MANY WAYS.

67
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:18,831
I THOUGHT YOUR PRAYER WAS

68
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:19,532
EXTRAORDINARILY TOUCHING WITH

69
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:20,666
THE PRESIDENT.

70
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:23,302
WHAT WAS YOUR WORST MOMENT?

71
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:25,705
I CAN IMAGINE WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR

72
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:26,372
FREEDOM YOU LOSE EVERYTHING

73
00:02:26,373 --> 00:02:29,709
ESPECIALLY IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY,

74
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,777
NOT KNOWING WHY YOU'RE BEING

75
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:33,512
HELD.

76
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:34,914
NOT HAVING ANYONE TO SHARE YOUR

77
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:36,115
FAITH, YOUR VALUES WITH YOU,

78
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:40,519
WHAT WAS YOUR LOWEST MOMENT?

79
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,588
>> WHEN I WAS ARRESTED AND IT

80
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:44,657
KEPT GOING ON AND ON, IT SEEMED

81
00:02:44,658 --> 00:02:47,560
THAT THERE WAS NO WAY OUT.

82
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:51,330
I LOST A LOT OF HOPE.

83
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:53,599
I BEGAN TO SEE THERE WAS VALUE

84
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,767
IN MY SUFFERING ESPECIALLY AS

85
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:55,735
TIME WENT ON.

86
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:57,436
I SAW THAT MANY PEOPLE AROUND

87
00:02:57,437 --> 00:02:58,437
THE WORLD BEGAN PRAYING FOR ME

88
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:03,009
AND I BEGAN TO SEE --

89
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,211
>> Sean: HOW DID YOU HEAR

90
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:05,711
ABOUT THAT?

91
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:07,713
>> MY WIFE, SHE WAS THE ONLY

92
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:08,914
CONTACT I HAD WITH THE OUTSIDE

93
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:09,215
WORLD.

94
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:11,417
SHE COULD VISIT ME FOR ABOUT

95
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:14,053
HALF AN HOUR EVERY WEEK SPEAKING

96
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:15,688
ON THE PHONE AND SHE WOULD BRING

97
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:16,656
ENCOURAGEMENT TO ME AND TELL ME

98
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:20,292
THAT PEOPLE WERE PRAYING FOR ME.

99
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:21,694
AS I LEARNED THAT, I BEGAN TO

100
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:23,095
SEE THAT GOD WAS INVOLVED IN US

101
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:23,929
AND HE WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING

102
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,565
WITH MY SUFFERING.

103
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:30,369
>> Sean: WHY DID YOU SAY IT

104
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,038
AND THIS MORNING THAT I WAS ONE

105
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,706
OF THE MOST HATED MAN IN TURKEY?

106
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:34,807
>> I WAS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO

107
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:38,511
OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT, OF

108
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:41,247
BEING ALIGNED WITH THE TERRORIST

109
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:42,481
MOVEMENT, ALSO BEING PART OF THE

110
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:46,519
PKK WHICH IS A GUERRILLA TERROR

111
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,287
MOVEMENT.

112
00:03:48,288 --> 00:03:50,356
I WAS PLANED FOR ECONOMIC

113
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:50,923
PROBLEMS TURKEY HAD.

114
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:52,291
IF THERE ARE PROBABLY AREN'T TOO

115
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:54,694
MANY PEOPLE WHO LIKE ME RIGHT

116
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:55,027
NOW.

117
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,095
>> Sean: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

118
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:57,329
MOMENT THAT TOUCHED A LOT OF

119
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,499
PEOPLE, YOU'RE A MAN OF GREAT

120
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,034
FAITH AND OBVIOUSLY A STRONG

121
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:03,235
CHRISTIAN AND YOU PRAYED FOR THE

122
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:03,936
PRESIDENT -- LET'S TALK ABOUT

123
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:06,672
THAT MOMENT.

124
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:09,208
>> IT'S SOMETHING WE HAD HOPED

125
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,111
TO BE ABLE TO DO.

126
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:14,113
MY WIFE FOR AT SOME TIME WANTED

127
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:15,715
TO PRAY SOME VERSES OVER HIM

128
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:17,416
FROM ISAIAH, JUST ASKING FOR THE

129
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,285
SPIRIT OF GOD TO COME UPON HIM.

130
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:22,388
BEFORE WE WENT TO MEET HIM, WE

131
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:23,322
LEARNED WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

132
00:04:23,323 --> 00:04:26,292
VISIT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WE ASK

133
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:27,593
GOD TO GIVE A SET OPPORTUNITY TO

134
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:29,695
PRAY FOR THE PRESIDENT.

135
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:30,896
IT'S A GREAT PRIVILEGE I THINK

136
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:33,399
MANY PASTORS WOULD LOVE TO DO I

137
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,666
IT.

138
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:36,302
OUR PRESIDENT NEEDS PRAYER.

139
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:38,304
>> Sean: WE ARE GLAD YOU'RE

140
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:39,872
HOME, IT WAS A VERY TOUCHING

141
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:40,206
MOMENT.

142
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:42,942
I THINK ALL OF US COULD USE MORE

143
00:04:42,943 --> 00:04:46,212
GOD IN OUR LIVES AND I THINK YOU

144
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:47,480

>> I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
