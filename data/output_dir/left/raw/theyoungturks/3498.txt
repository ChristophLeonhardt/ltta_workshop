1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,800
I WAS THINKING THOUGH, YOU
HAVE THE NORMALIZATION COMING

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,200
FROM SOME ON THE RIGHT, AN
ORGANIZATION LIKE MEDIA MATTERS,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,469
YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF, YOU
HAD A LONG SPAN WHERE OBAMA WAS

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,950
PRESIDENT, NOW YOU HAVE THIS
YEAR WITH TRUMP, WHAT IS YOUR

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,330
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
NOW?

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:26,400
>> THE CORE CRITIQUE IS THE
SAME, MISINFORMATION IS BAD, AND

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,980
SPECIFICALLY THAT IT ISN'T JUST
THAT MISINFORMATION IS AN

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,729
ACCIDENT, FOR A WHILE ORIGINALLY
AND FOR MUCH OF OUR MISSION IT

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,239
WAS ABOUT THAT THERE WAS AN
INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO MISINFORM,

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,370
TO POISON THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA,
AND IT USED TO BE A JUST A BUNCH

11
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:47,720
OF RIGHT-WING ACTORS, THEY WOULD
BULLY THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA INTO

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,340
PICKING UP THEIR SLANT.

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,500
THAT'S
THE PART THAT'S RADICALLY

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,510
DIFFERENT IS THAT IT'S MORE
COMPLICATED AND CONFUSING, YOU

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,160
HAVE RUSSIAN ACTIVE MEASURES
PARTICIPATING TO SOME EXTENT,

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,490
AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT STORY
GETS OVERBLOWN IN TERMS OF WHEN

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,259
IT GETS REPORTED ON THEY AREN'T
GETTING TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF

18
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:10,409
IT, BUT TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND
IT PLAIN HOW IT FITS TOGETHER IS

19
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,710
WE DID A LOT EARLY ON TO LOOK AT
WHAT IS THE FAKE NEWS PROBLEM,

20
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,500
WHAT DO THEY MEAN WHEN THEY TALK
ABOUT THAT?

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
I THERE IS A

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:24,659
FRAMEWORK THAT HELPS UNDERSTAND,
A LOT OF IT IS COMING TO THESE

23
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:31,759
ONLINE COMMUNITIES LIKE 4CHAN,
THEY ARE CREATING AND DRIVING A

24
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,159
LOT OF WHAT BECOME NARRATIVES,
THEN A SECOND LAYER OF

25
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,329
STORYTELLERS WHICH ARE LARGELY
WEBSITES NOT DESIGNED FOR

26
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:44,899
IDEOLOGICAL PURPOSES BUT JUST TO
GET VIRAL TRAFFIC, AND WE FOUND

27
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:50,890
AN ASYMMETRY COME ON FACEBOOK
ALONE CONSERVATIVE LEANING SITES

28
00:01:50,890 --> 00:02:01,060
ARE 2.5 TIMES THE SIZE OF LEFT
LEANING ONES.

29
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,060
IF YOU THINK ABOUT

30
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,320
HOW SOME OF THAT FITS INTO THE
FAKE NEWS PROBLEM, THAT'S HOW

31
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,840
YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF THESE
STORIES GO VIRAL AND HAVE THE

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,389
SATURATION THEY DO, IS BECAUSE
THERE'S THIS CONSTELLATION OF

33
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,830
IDEOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES, AND IF
YOU LOOK AT THAT FRAMEWORK IT

34
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,830
DOESN'T JUST EXPLAIN HOW THE
FAKE NEWS PROBLEM CAME IN, THEN

35
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,920
YOU CAN SEE WHERE BOTS AND OTHER
FORMS OF MANIPULATION ARE A

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,070
FACTOR.

37
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,760
SO FOR ME THE MISSION IS
HOW DO WE MONITOR THIS IN A WAY

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,230
THAT'S JUST CHASING EVERY FACT,
IT'S 10% NOT 12%, BUT WHAT CORE

39
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,320
NARRATIVES ARE COMING OUT AND
HOW DO THEY INFLUENCE THE

40
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,460
BROADER CONVERSATION?

41
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,410
AND LASTLY
WHAT KINDS OF DATA AND

42
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,600
INFORMATION DO WE NEED TO GIVE
TO PLATFORMS TO GET THEM TO ONE

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,870
RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM AND START
TO PUT IN PLACE SOLUTIONS THAT

44
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,211
AREN'T CENSORSHIP DRIVEN BUT
RATHER LOOKING AT, SAY, THE

45
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:54,200
CHEATING AND THE MANIPULATIONS,
THAT'S REALLY THE BIGGEST SHIFT

46
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,270
IS SPENDING MORE TIME ON MESSAGE
BOARDS THAN SAY FOX NEWS IN A

47
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,550
WAY, BUT IT MATTERS MORE.

48
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,190
IF YOU
GO BACK, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW

49
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,410
MANY TIMES YOU CAN TRACE
SPECIFIC FOX NEWS SEGMENTS OR

50
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,460
EVEN DONALD TRUMP TWEETS TO A
4CHAN THREAD FROM TWO DAYS AGO.

51
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,230
>>IT DISSEMINATES FOR A COUPLE
DAYS, AND THEN IT HITS.

52
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,930
>>EXACTLY, TUCKER CARLSON AND
PEOPLE LIKE THAT SOLICIT

53
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,500
SEGMENTS FROM THEM.

54
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
IT USED TO
BE THE CASE THAT THESE

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,650
RIGHT-WING PLACES ARE THE
VANGUARD BUT NOW THEY ARE JUST

56
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,810
REPACKAGING THESE STORIES FOR AN
AUDIENCE THAT ISN'T USING 4CHAN.

57
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,740
>> ARE THESE THE PLACES WHERE
THERE IS A REVERBERATION OF

58
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,120
THESE MESSAGES -- IS IT MORE
POWERFUL THAN FOX NEWS, CNN,

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
MSNBC PUT TOGETHER?

60
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,200
>>WITHOUT A DOUBT, AND IT'S
REFLECTED IN EVERYTHING A

61
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
METRIC.

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,240
IN THE LAST CYCLE
STARTING IN THE SUMMERTIME FOR

63
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,040
THE FIRST TIME EVER THE
AGGREGATE CONSUMPTION OF THIS

64
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,120
HYPER IDEOLOGICAL AND FABRICATED
STORIES EXCEEDED THE TOTAL

65
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,590
CONSUMPTION ON SOCIAL MEDIA FROM
ALL OF THE MAINSTREAM SITES

66
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,590
COMBINED.

67
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,160
AND WE HAD TO BE
GENEROUS IN THAT ANALYSIS AND

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,190
INCLUDE PLACES LIKE PEOPLE JUST
SO IT WASN'T SO DEPRESSING THAT

69
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,520
WE ALL WANT TO QUIT.

70
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,960
THAT THE
LANDSCAPE, THEY ARE INCREDIBLY

71
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,230
POWERFUL FORCES, AND THAT'S NOT
TO SAY THEY ARE ALL BAD, THIS

72
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:21,510
TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS FOR NEW
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AS WELL,

73
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,710
THERE ARE HUGE ADVANTAGES, BUT
THAT ASYMMETRY IS A PROBLEM.

74
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,710
AND

75
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,110
ONE LAST PIECE I THINK IS MOST
STARTLING OF ALL, IN THE LAST

76
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,620
CYCLE THOSE THAT IDENTIFIED IS
LEFT OF CENTER, ALMOST 1 OUT OF

77
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,470
EVERY TWO PEOPLE THAT IDENTIFIED
LEFT OF CENTER DID NOT POST A

78
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,310
SINGLE THING RELATED TO POLITICS
OR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT ON THEIR

79
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,740
SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS, THAT NUMBER
IS ONLY 8% ON THE CONSERVATIVE

80
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,170
SIDE.

81
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,470
WHICH IS A TESTAMENT TO
WIN SOMETHING ON THE LEFT GOES

82
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,930
VIRAL OR THEY DO HAVE AN
AUDIENCE, IT SHOWS THEY ARE

83
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,500
OVERCOMING NOT JUST THE
DISTRIBUTION ASYMMETRY BUT A PER

84
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,500
DISSIPATION GAP. AND FOR ME OUR
MISSION NOW IS AS MUCH ABOUT

85
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,160
UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS HAPPENING
WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES AND

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,910
LANDSCAPES AND THE STRUCTURAL
PIECES AROUND IT AS IT IS ABOUT

87
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,070
SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT THAT
ONE STAT, BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE

88
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,330
ASSUMPTION ABOUT GETTING BACK TO
POWER, ABOUT POLITICAL

89
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,670
ORGANIZING, IS BASED ON THE IDEA
THAT IF THEY JUST HAD THE RIGHT

90
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,500
MESSAGE OR THE BEST DIGITAL
STRATEGY THEY WILL FIND THE

91
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,840
PEOPLE.

92
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,270
AND IF MORE AND MORE OF
THOSE PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY AS

93
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,450
LEFT OF CENTER ARE TUNING OUT,
HOW DO YOU GET THEM BACK INCOME

94
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,500
HOW DO YOU MARKET TO THEM OR
PULL THEM IN IF THEY ARE

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,060
DISENGAGING, BECAUSE THEY JUST
DON'T WANT TO BE ABUSED BECAUSE

96
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,060
OF THE LANDSCAPE --

97
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,140
>>I WOULDN'T HAVE GUESSED IT WAS
THAT HIGH.

98
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:35,610
>>IT'S A SCARY STATISTIC, AND I
SEE THAT IS A BIG PIECE OF OUR

99
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,580
CORE MISSION IS AS MUCH ABOUT
UNDERSTANDING IT AND WHAT IS

100
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,250
GOING INTO THESE COMMUNITIES AND
HOW THEY ARE SORT OF CREATING

101
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,100
NOT JUST THE ASYMMETRY BETWEEN
THE DISSED ABUSE AND PLATFORMS

102
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,770
BUT EVEN BETWEEN PARTICIPATION,
AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO

103
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,880
START TO DEAL WITH IT?

104
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,060
>>THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

105
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,830
WE HAVE
A LOT OF STUFF TO DO --

106
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,650
>> THE STEREOTYPE IS THAT
EVERYBODY JUST WANTS TO GET OUT,

107
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,530
THEY ARE TALKING AND ALL THAT,
BUT THAT'S A HUGE GAP BETWEEN

108
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:14,740
PROGRESSIVES 
AND

109
00:06:14,740 --> 00:00:00,000
NON-PROGRESSIVES.
