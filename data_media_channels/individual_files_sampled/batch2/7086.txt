there's an apparent injustice occurring as we speak and it has to do with a police officer that many are calling a hero based on his actions during the pulse a nightclub shooting and the aftermath this is Omar Delgado was one of the first officers at the club in the early hours of June 12th 2016 after gunmen killed 49 people and injured dozens in what then was the deadliest mass shooting in US history but US history moves fast so we have exceeded that since Delgado who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of witnessing the carnage scoured through bodies that littered the ground and helped survivors get to safety now before I tell you the unfortunate turn take a look at this video showing Omar Delgado talking to in the hospital one of the people that he saved that night are you an angel good my name is officer Omar Delgado I'm one of the ones that helped you get out of harm's way I need a big house anyway and I appreciate it thank you doing good enough so so glad you're alive man show your family was bigger than I did you alive so look we point out very often there are a lot of bad cops in this country who have terrible beliefs about the people in the areas that they're policing who do terrible things break laws brutalize people over the Delgado was one of the first people who rushed into an unimaginably dangerous situation before there was much backup at the risk of his own life did that and has been affected mentally scarred by that experience he's also scarred by this the department is terminating Delgado from the force at the end of the month an extra six months on the job he's been there for almost ten years it would have allowed Delgado to receive 64 percent of his salary with benefits for life basically his pension since he's gonna leave the force unwillingly before making it to ten years he will receive 42 percent of his earnings he was not making a ton of money being just a copy but that is a significant portion of what he would then be living on and he has medical expenses due to the PTSD and just six months before he would be able to to get that pension they're kicking him out he's been working on desk duty since the attack and the department said they need to replace him because of his PTSD that's they're not saying that openly but that's what he's saying they said to him and because they need an additional officer on patrol a job he could no longer perform okay he asked them to just let him stay to six months so cops have a union and in the case of the cops sometimes that you you know over is a little overzealous in defending them no matter what they did and who they shot how quickly they shot them but the union has up sides and so that's why sometimes Republicans hate unions because they organize they get you a good salary in this case he has a whopping salary of thirty-eight thousand five hundred dollars yeah so it's not ten years on the force yeah so if you know I just sometimes I direct the video the right-wingers because I feel like they're out there going oh man yeah you probably got a big salary and if why should would of taxpayers pay 64 percent of the settle 42 percent it's 30 $1500 and he risked his life I mean this is exactly the kind of guy that you should love he risked his life to run in there and he was talking about it like he wakes up having nightmares all the time when he's combing through the dead bodies which he saw an experience and Omar Martine by the way a Muslim radical terrorist right in his nightmares he starts shooting again etc so it's like he was in a war zone and he kind of was yeah and and I want to read you what angel : the guy you saw in the hospital said he said about Delgado he was my hero he saved my life and for them to just do what they're doing to him in front of my face is a slap to my face as well he did his job that night on June 12 so they should have his back a hundred percent totally and just be there for whatever he needs so he goes and saves these people's lives I mean that is the best of us the best of the cops the best of their protectiveness serve exactly right so you can't have him do decks desk duty for another six months months no no no I got a cut cost I got to be brutal I got to get him out of there even though he's literally among the most heroic cops in the country how many other cops are there a lot of them risk their lives don't get me wrong but that had risked their lives in a massacre to save people and done it right and now but we got no no because of money money money money rules everything so we got to crush this guy and we got to crush his soul and his retirement money because we have to save a little extra a couple of bucks here in there if you don't stand up for this cop who do you stand up for if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
