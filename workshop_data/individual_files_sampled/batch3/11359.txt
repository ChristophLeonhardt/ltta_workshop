u.s. defense contractor Lockheed Martin has felt the wrath of the internet when a twitter marketing stunt on world photo day backfired spectacularly let's go live now to our T's heal up my pen for the details hi there Caleb so what did the Lockheed Martin social media team do to get Twitter users so riled well it was kind of a gimmick the idea was that for world photo day they encouraged people to post what they called amazing photos of their products now Lockheed Martin is a weapons manufacturing military contractor it's probably one of them it's probably the biggest if if not the biggest one of the biggest defense contractors of the Pentagon it's tied in with NATO countries aerospace weapons etc now it has signed multi-million dollar deals with Saudi Arabia to produce weapons and on its website Lockheed Martin actually brags about its relationship with Riyadh the fact that it is selling lots of weapons and military equipment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia so when they went forward and had this idea that they would have people tweet at them images of their products some people were quite aware that Saudi Arabia is supplying weapons that the Lockheed Martin is supplying Saudi Arabia with weapons that are being used in the conflict in Saudi Arabia in Yemen now Lockheed Martin reportedly apparently was supplied some of the weapons that were used in a recent airstrike let's take a listen so the request for photos from Lockheed Martin seems to have backfired as many were aware of the fact that Lockheed Martin is supplying the weapons being used by Saudi Arabia against Yemen let's take a look at how their request seems to have exploded in their face dear Lockheed Martin you asked people to tweet amazing photos of one of your products here it is this is a fragment of your bomb a laser-guided MK 82 which Saudi Arabia used to kill 40 children in Yemen last week here is the product of your products the fact that Lockheed Martin has a generic happy little corporate Twitter is wild to me so it appears that in response to the number of tweets and responses about their involvement in Yemen and their supplying of weapons to Saudi Arabia for use against Yemen that they then deleted the tweet calling for photographs so it remains to be seen if in the future they will ever carry out any other social media publicity stunts of this kind you
