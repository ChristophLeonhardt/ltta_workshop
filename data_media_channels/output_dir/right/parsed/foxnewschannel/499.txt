YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FAIR
PROCESS, YOU CAME TO THE WRONG
TOWN AT THE WRONG TIME, MY
FRIEND.
PETE: SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM
DECIDED TO TAKE HIS TIME FROM
MISS MITCHELL, THE ARIZONA
PROSECUTOR, AND GO AHEAD AND LET
EVERYONE KNOW WHAT HE THOUGHT OF
THIS PROCESS.
SENATOR, DID YOU KNOW YOU WERE
GOING TO SAY THAT?
>> KNOW.
I KNEW I FELT THAT.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING
TO DO.
I THOUGHT MISS MITCHELL DID A
GOOD JOB.
THE WHOLE GOAL FOR ME IS TO GET
DOCTOR FORD, WALK HER THROUGH
HER TESTIMONY, WHAT YOU CAN'T
SAY, SHE IS 100% CONFIDENT BUT
LET ME TELL YOU I'M 100%
CONFIDENT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH,
SOMETHING DID HAPPEN TO MISS
FORD BUT AFTER HER TESTIMONY, I
DON'T KNOW WHO TOOK HER TO THE
PARTY, I DON'T KNOW WHO DROVE
HER BACK BUT SOMEBODY DID.
I DO KNOW THIS.
WE OFFERED TO TAKE HER TESTIMONY
IN PRIVATE IN CALIFORNIA AND IF
HER LAWYERS DIDN'T TELL HER
THAT, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM.
I KNOW HER LETTER WAS GIVEN TO 3
GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND THE PERSON
WHO LEAKED IT TO THE PRESS
INTENDED FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.
IT WAS A POLITICAL DECISION BY
SOMEBODY TO BETRAY HER TRUST, TO
SLOW DOWN THIS NOMINATION,
DESTROY BRETT KAVANAUGH AND TRY
TO HOLD HIS SEAT OPEN.
AINSLEY: WHY DID YOU DO IT?
YOU SAID WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
WANTED TO SAY BUT HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO SAY.
>> THERE WAS A LINE OF
QUESTIONING, WHY DON'T YOU TURN
TO DON THE GONE -- MCGAHN SO THE
FBI CAN DO A THOROUGH JOB AND
HERE'S WHAT GOT ME.
HOW DARE YOU ASK THIS MAN IF HE
IS INNOCENT, TO DO ANYTHING.
HE IS BEFORE YOU, DENYING IT IN
EVERY DETAIL, WE STILL DON'T
KNOW THE DATE, THE LOCATION.
IT IS NOT HE SAID SHE SAID, SHE
SAID, THEY SAID.
IT WAS AN EFFORT POLITICALLY TO
DELAY THE HEARING, TO PUT THE
BURDEN ON HIM, TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE HE MUST BE GUILTY IF HE
DOESN'T WANT TO DELAY THIS
HEARING PAST THE MIDTERMS.
I HAD IT WITH THIS PROCESS.
THE PERSON WHO LEAKED THIS
LETTER DID IT ON PURPOSE TO
CREATE A POLITICAL PROBLEM, TO
SLOW DOWN THE HEARING, TO START
A NARRATIVE, TO DESTROY BRETT
CAVANAGH, THEY COULD GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT DOCTOR FORD.
IF SHE WAS NOT TOLD WE WERE
WILLING TO GO TO CALIFORNIA, I
FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.
PETE: YOUR COLLEAGUE DIANE
FEINSTEIN WAS QUERIED BY JOHN
CORNYN, DID YOU LEAK IT?
SHE SAID NO I DIDN'T.
BUT I HAVEN'T ASKED HIM, I TRUST
HIM.
THE PAST STAFF SAID WE DIDN'T DO
IT AND SHE SAID PROBABLY CAME
FROM ONE OF DOCTOR FORD'S
FRIENDS.
DO YOU BUY THAT?
>> KNOW.
I BY DIANE FEINSTEIN, I LIKE HER
AND TRUST HER.
SOMEBODY DID IT IN THE CIRCLE OF
THE CALIFORNIA CONGRESSWOMAN IN
HER OFFICE, DIANE FEINSTEIN'S
OFFICE, THE LAWYERS, THE LAWYERS
WERE RECOMMENDED BY FEINSTEIN.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE SHE IS
COMING FROM, SHE IS NOT EXACTLY
APOLITICAL.
SOMEBODY LEAKED THIS ANONYMOUS
ALLEGATION FOR THE VERY PURPOSE
WE SEE TODAY, TO DELAY THIS
HEARING TO DESTROY BRETT
KAVANAUGH'S LIFE AND THEY NEVER
INTENDED TO PROTECT MISS FORD.
>> USED UP FOR YOURSELF, LOOKED
AT THE DEMOCRATS AND SAID YOU
ARE FRIENDS AND YOU ACTUALLY
SAID YOU WANTED TO LAY THIS AND
THEN YOU WANT TO WIN, WHAT IS
YOUR MESSAGE FOR YOUR FRIENDS
THAT ARE REPUBLICANS?
>> IF YOU LEGITIMIZE THIS BY
VOTING KNOW YOU ARE SETTING UP
THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL FUTURE
NOMINEES, YOU'RE DENYING A GOOD
MAN, HIGHLY QUALIFIED WHO LED AN
INCREDIBLE LIFE, THE CHANCE TO
SERVE THE COUNTRY IN THE
POSITION HE IS QUALIFIED FOR,
LEGITIMIZING THE POLITICS OF
DESTRUCTION.
YOU ARE MISSING A LOT IF YOU
DON'T SEE THIS AS A POLITICAL
HIT JOB.
THE ACCUSATIONS OF FALL APART.
IF HE HAS TO PROVE HIMSELF
INNOCENT, HE DID FOR ME, WHAT
STANDARD WOULD WE USE IN THE
FUTURE FOR A REPUBLICAN, IF YOU
LEGITIMIZE THIS, OUR PARTY IS
GOING TO LOOK AT YOU AS HAVING
LOST YOUR WAY AND IF YOU
LEGITIMIZE THIS I DON'T KNOW,
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HIS
DAUGHTERS YOU I CANNOT DO THAT.
>> WHAT ABOUT SENATOR
WHITEHOUSE?
IF HE DOES GET CONFIRMED BY
TUESDAY THEY WILL START
IMPEACHING.
THEY WILL LOOK TO IMPEACH HIM.
>> HE BROUGHT TO ME THE
ALLEGATION ABOUT THE INCIDENT IN
RHODE ISLAND AND WE WENT
TOGETHER TO THE FBI AND THE GUY
WITHDREW THE ACCUSATION.
IT WAS FALSE.
HE DID THE RIGHT THING.
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT COULD
HAPPEN.
THERE IS NO STATUTE OF
LIMITATIONS AND MARYLAND FOR
SEXUAL ASSAULT.
I WOULD TELL SENATOR WHITEHOUSE
AND EVERYBODY ELSE IF THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT OR ANY OTHER AGENCY
OPENS THIS CASE AND THERE IS A
CONVICTION I WILL GLADLY REOPEN
THIS MATTER BUT I WILL BE IN THE
NBA BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.
I DON'T LIKE MY CHANCES.
PETE: YESTERDAY YOU WERE SO
PASSIONATE.
>> I WAS PISSED.
BRIAN: IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE YOU
HAD IT UP TO HERE WITH HOW
THINGS ARE WORKING IN THAT ROOM.
>> I HAD IT UP TO HERE BECAUSE I
VOTED FOR SOTOMAYOR AND KAGAN,
SOME ACCUSED HER OF BEING A
RACIST BECAUSE OF A SINGLE
SPEECH OR KAGAN BEING
UN-AMERICAN BECAUSE SHE
SUPPORTED KICKING THE ROTC UNIT
OUT OF HARVARD.
THAT IS AT HARVARD.
THEY ARE GOOD LIBERAL JUDGES,
GOOD WOMEN AND I CAN'T IMAGINE I
WOULD HAVE DONE THIS TO THEM AND
WHAT WAS DONE TO BRETT CAVANAGH
WAS PLANNED, ORCHESTRATED,
POLITICS AT ITS WORST, THE
ACCUSATIONS OFFENDS MY
SENSIBILITY.
I WANT WOMEN TO BE HEARD BUT I
WILL NOT BE PLAYED AND I WILL
NOT HAVE MY INTELLIGENCE
INSULTED.
AINSLEY: I REMEMBER WHEN YOU
VOTED FOR KAGAN AND SOTOMAYOR
AND SOME IN YOUR STATE -- TO YOU
THINK NOW IS PAYING OFF?
YOUR MESSAGE TO THE DEMOCRATS,
THIS GUY IS QUALIFIED, YOU
BETTER VOTE FOR HIM?
>> THEY ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE
FOR HIM.
>> YOU DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM
WILL?
>> STROM THURMOND VOTED FOR
GINSBURG.
SHE IS HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND VERY
LIBERAL, 96 PEOPLE VOTED FOR
SCALIA.
TRYING TO BE THE WAY IT USED TO
BE, ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES,
HONOR THE RESULTS BUT WHEN IT
COMES TO TRUMP THE ELECTION
DIDN'T HAPPEN.
WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS UNDERMINING
THE ELECTION, NO HOLDS BARRED
POLITICS, THE POLITICS OF
DESTRUCTION AND DELAY, NOT
ADVISE AND CONSENT.
IF HE LOSES, IF BRETT KAVANAUGH
LOSES, WE WILL BE ON TO THE NEXT
GROUP TO COME FORWARD.
>> WHAT WAS YOUR CONVERSATION
WITH THE PRESIDENT LIKE LAST
NIGHT?
>> IT WAS LONG.
I SAID I HAVE A NEW NUMBER.
YOU DIDN'T GIVE THIS NUMBER OUT.
I GOT A NEW NUMBER AND A BUNCH
OF PEOPLE BEATING ON MY DOOR
LAST NIGHT.
PETE: YOU HAVE BEEN TALKED.
YOU AND SENATOR HATCH.
>> I TOLD THE PRESIDENT I'M
GOING TO GIVE YOU MY NUMBER, THE
NEW ONE.
HE WAS VERY COMPLEMENTARY AND HE
SAID MILANIA SAID, PLEASE TELL
ME SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF THE
FACT THAT I PUSH BACK AND STAND
UP FOR THIS GOOD MAN AND THAT
MEANT A LOT TO ME THAT THE FIRST
LADY FELT THAT WAY.
PETE: SOMEBODY USING A
CONGRESSIONAL COMPUTER PUT YOUR
PERSONAL INFORMATION ON
WIKIPEDIA SO PEOPLE COULD CALL
YOU.
I IMAGINE THERE WILL BE AN
INQUIRY INTO WHERE THAT
PARTICULAR MACHINE IS.
>> I TELL YOU WHAT.
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPUTERS I'M
THE PERFECT GUY TO ASK ABOUT
THEM BECAUSE I DON'T USE THEM A
LOT.
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT.
IF PEOPLE THINK I HAVE BRETT
KAVANAUGH, I AM PROUD HE
DESERVED TO BE HELPED.
THIS IS ABOUT HIM.
HE HAS LED A LIFE I COULDN'T
BEGIN TO IMAGINE IN TERMS OF WHO
HE IS COMING IN TERMS OF
INTELLECT AND HIS GOODNESS.
I NEVER MET A MORE CAPABLE, GOOD
PERSON.
I HAVE KNOWN THE GUY FOR 20
YEARS AND I AM IN A BUSINESS
WHERE YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT
TO SAY, I AM FAIR GAME BUT THIS
GUY DID NOT DESERVE THIS.
HIS TWO DAUGHTERS IF NOTHING
ELSE IT SHOULD BE THE PARENTS OF
THE YEAR, THAT 10-YEAR-OLD, SHE
HAS IT WITHIN HER ABILITY TO
PRAY FOR THE LADY AND THEY
RAISED A FINE YOUNG LADY.
AINSLEY: HIS PARENTS SITTING
BEHIND HIM.
>> BROKE MY HEART BUT IT IS WHAT
IT IS.
WE ARE GOING TO WIN.
