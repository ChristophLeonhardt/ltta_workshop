JOURNALIST WILLING TO PROTECT RESOURCES AND GO TO JAIL? YOU HAVE THE LAW THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PROTECT SOURCES. WE HAVE THE ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT. THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR. Martha: NOW THAT AVENATTI'S INTEGRITY IS BEING QUESTIONED BY SOME, HE IS THREATENING THOSE WHO ARE DIGGING AROUND IN HIS BACKGROUND, INCLUDING "THE DAILY CALLER," WHERE THIS ARTICLE WAS POSTED. "AVENATTI IN THE SPOTLIGHT HIS NEXT MY NEXT GUEST IS ALSO THE SUBJECT OF AVENATTI'S FIRE. LONGTIME CLINTON ADVISOR MIKE PENN RECENTLY WROTE A VERY TOUGH PIECE FOR THE HILL. WHO IS PAYING MICHAEL AVENATTI? SUGGESTING THE REAL MOTIVATIONS MIGHT BE POLITICAL. HERE NOW IS MIKE PENN AND FORMER ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. YOU SAY IN YOUR PIECE AVENATTI IS ACTING LESS LIKE AN ATTORNEY AND MORE LIKE A JOURNALIST OR SOMEONE DOING OPERA RESEARCH FOR A DEMOCRATIC PARTY. EXACTLY WHO IS HE YOU SAY? A LAWYER, AND OPPOSITION OR CAMPAIGN OPERATIVE? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT AND WHERE THAT IS 100 INTERVIEWS ON CNN AND TELLS THEIR CLIENT TO IGNORE A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT. IT RAISED A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND ALL I DID WAS REALLY QUESTION WHERE IS HE BEING PAID? IT SAYS HE'S GOT A CROWD SOURCED FUNDING BUT THAT WAS NOT SET UP UNTIL HE WAS REPRESENTING HER FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. IF SO WHERE IS THAT $500,000 THAT HE HAS RAISED GOING? NO ACCOUNTING TO THAT. WHERE DID HE GET THESE BANK RECORDS THAT MAYBE THE TREASURY AND PROSECUTORS WOULD HAVE? IS AT WORK PRODUCT. HE'S DISCLOSED IT. HE'S WAIVED ANY PRIVILEGE BY DISCLOSING. IF THESE ARGUMENTS ARE NONSENSE. HE'S OUT GIVING 100 INTERVIEWS AND LET ME TELL YOU, HE'S NOT HELPING DEMOCRATS BECAUSE SINCE HE WENT OUT THERE WITH STORMY DANIELS, DEMOCRATS HAVE TANKS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS PRESIDENT TRUMP TO TALK ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST TO END NORTH KOREA AND DEMOCRATS ARE SITTING THERE WITH STORMY DANIELS. I DON'T THINK WE WANT A REPEAT OF 1998 AND SURELY THIS GUY IS NOT THE GUY WE WANT SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF DEMOCRATS FOR SURE. Martha: IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY WORKED FOR BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON, A LONGTIME DEMOCRAT AND GET YOU TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITH THE PIECES THAT YOU ARE WRITING, YOU HAVE BEEN SORT OF STICKING UP FOR THE ARGUMENT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MAKING HERE, IS THAT WHAT DRIVES YOU? THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD AGAIN? THAT YOU FEEL LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN 1998 WAS A TRAVESTY? EXACTLY. I SPENT A YEAR FIGHTING AGAINST KEN START AND WE DECIDED AS A COUNTRY, LOOK, THESE PERSONAL ACTIONS, WE CAN'T HAVE PERJURY TRAPS AND OTHER WAYS OF TRAPPING PEOPLE INTO VIOLATIONS OVER YOUR THAT WE HOLD UP THE WHOLE COUNTRY FOR. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND THE EFFORTS CASE, IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE IN THE CLINTON CASE AND I WISH MORE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WOULD GET TOGETHER AND SAY LET'S FIGHT IT OUT ON THE ISSUES, LET'S VOTE PEOPLE OUT WE DON'T LIKE, LET'S NOT TRY TO CRIMINALIZE EVERYTHING AND YOU BET I THINK IT WAS WRONG IN '98 AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S WRONG NOW AND I THINK MORE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT ON THAT. Martha: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO MICHAEL AVENATTI? IS TWEETING ABOUT YOU. TOO BAD HE DIDN'T DO ANY BASIC RESEARCH FOR HIS RIDICULOUS PIECE IN THE HILL. HE GOES ON TO SAY WE DID NOTHING WRONG. AS I SAID, HE SET THIS UP SOMETIME LATER AFTER HE GOT QUESTIONS FROM JOURNALISTS AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WHERE'S THE MONEY AND IN THE QUESTION IS WHERE DID HE GET THESE DOCUMENTS AND WHAT THEIR AUTHENTICITY AND WAS SOMETHING DONE ILLEGALLY AND IS THERE ANOTHER OPERA RESEARCH SET UP. BEHIND HIM THAT'S BEING PAID BY DONORS. IT GOT TO READ HIS STATEMENTS VERY CAREFULLY. HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DENY EVERYTHING HE SAYS HE IS DENIED
