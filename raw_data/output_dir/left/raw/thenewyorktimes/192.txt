1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,501
So if you can go into
the Civitan and play,

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:04,500
people would know you in
the streets of Saginaw.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,300
So your name will
start to ring.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,991
O.K., we got this 
little guy over here

5
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:08,990
named Draymond Green.

6
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,010
They call him Day Day.

7
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,910
Oh, he can ball with
the best of them.

8
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,950
It was just like a
relief valve, you know?

9
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,060
Kids being off the streets,
talking to other kids,

10
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,630
growing up with other
kids at the Civitan.

11
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,040
It was always packed,
always packed.

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,180
Wood floor, fiberglass rims.

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,550
The gym was great,
and so that’s

14
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,224
why we miss the Civitan now.

15
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:31,140
[inaudible] Yeah, that
was away he got the —

16
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,639
[chuckles]

17
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:33,530
— he got the
attitude built in.

18
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,630
I would try to make
him cry, but that’s

19
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,975
where he learned how to —

20
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:39,160
his, like, no-quit attitude.

21
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,840
It was just very
intense, very intense.

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,560
And I was trying to push
him to the level of,

23
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,770
where is your breaking point?

24
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,380
So I knew how to make him
mad, but I didn’t know

25
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,760
what would make him quit.

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,060
Everything Draymond does on
the court right now started

27
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,770
when he first started playing.

28
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,050
What you see, what
he doing on TV,

29
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:00,000
is what he’s been
doing all his life.
