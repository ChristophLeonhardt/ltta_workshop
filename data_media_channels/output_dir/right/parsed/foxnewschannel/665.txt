JESSE: DURING HIS MONTANA RALLY
THURSDAY HE LAUNCHED HIS LATEST
ATTACK ON ELIZABETH WASHEN.
HE CALLS HER POCAHONTAS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: WHEN I
ANNOUNCED THEY ARE GOING TO
ENDORSE ME, SHOULD I LOSE OR IF
I DON'T RUN, THEY ARE OUT OF
BUSINESS.
ARE THEY GOING TO COVER BERNIE?
THEY ARE GOING TO COVER LIKE
SLEEPY JOE BIDEN?
THEY ARE GOING TO COVER
POCAHONTAS?
THINK OF IT.
WHAT TRIBE IS IT.
LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT ONE.
SHE BASED HER LIFE ON BEING A
MINORITY.
POCAHONTAS.
THEY ALWAYS WANT ME TO APOLOGIZE
FOR SAYING IT.
I HEREBY.
POCAHONTAS I APOLOGIZE TO YOU.
I APOLOGIZE.
TO YOU I APOLOGIZE.
IT'S CAUSING HER PROBLEMS.
BECAUSE NOW EVEN THE LIBERALS
ARE SAYING TAKE A TEST.
TAKE A TEST.
YOU KNOW, I TELL YOU -- I
SHOULDN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE I
LIKE NOT TO GIVE AWAY SECRETS.
LET'S SAY I'M DEBATING
POCAHONTAS.
I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO THIS.
YOU KNOW THOSE LITTLE KITS THEY
SELL ON TELEVISION FOR $2?
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEBATE WHEN
SHE PROCLAIMS THAT SHE IS OF
INDIAN HERITAGE BECAUSE HER
EVIDENCE, THAT HER MOTHER SAID
SHE HAD HIGH CHEEKBONES.
WE'LL GENTLY TAKE THAT KIT AND
SLOWLY TOSS IT, HOPING IT
DOESN'T HIT HER AND INJURE HER
ARM.
I WILL GIVE YOU A MILLION
DOLLARS YOUR FAVORITE CHARITY
PAID FOR BY TRUMP IF YOU TAKE
JESSE: THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST
PERFORMANCES I HAVE SEEN THE
PRESIDENT DELIVER IN A WHILE.
DO YOU THINK POCAHONTAS IS GOING
TO TAKE THE TEST?
>> SHE SHOULD COME CLEAN.
SHE SHOULD COME CLEAN ABOUT HER
HERITAGE AND ALSO COME CLEAN
INSTEAD OF BLAMING PRESIDENT
TRUMP SHE NEEDS TO COME CLEAN
AND LET EVERYBODY KNOW HOW THEY
WERE BEING HYPOCRITES.
SHE DID NOT PROTEST AGAINST
OBAMA AND HIS ADMINISTRATION
WHEN HE HAD CHILDREN LOCKED UP
IN CAGES.
JESSE: THAT'S TRUE.
I DON'T MEAN TO DISPARAGE HER
WHEN I CALL HER POCAHONTAS.
HERSELF AND SHE COULD BRIT TO AN
END BUT I DON'T THINK SHE'LL
TAKE THE TEST.
MAXINE WATERS.
I.Q. INDIVIDUAL.
MAXINE WATERS.
SHE IS SOMEWHERE IN THE MID
60s.
HE'LL BE IMPEACHED.
I WILL IMPEACH HIM.
EVEN THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING,
HOW ARE YOU SAYING THAT?
THEY DON'T WANT TO USE THAT WORD
BECAUSE IT GETS THE REPUBLICANS
OUT TO VOTE.
THEY SAY STAY AWAY FROM THAT
WORD.
JESSE: MAXINE IS IN A BIT OF A
BEEF WITH TOP DEMOCRATS.
CHUCK SCHUMER TOLD HER TO PIPE
NOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING
SIDE.
>> YES, IT IS.
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.
MAXINE WATERS I.Q. IS VERY LOW.
WE LOOK AT HER AS A DOMESTIC
TERRORIST.
SHE IS TELLING AMERICANS TO
ATTACK OTHER AMERICANS.
MAXINE WATERS AND HER RHETORIC
IS THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING
TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE
SHE REPRESENTS THE PARTY OF
DIVISIVENESS.
JESSE: I WOULDN'T GO SO FAR AS
TO CALL HER A DOMESTIC
TERRORIST.
THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE OVER THE
LINE, BUT LASTLY, REMEMBER
SINBAD FROM BACK IN THE DAY?
>> YES, WE DO.
JESSE: I THINK HE POPPED OUT OF
THE PIRATE SHIP AND REEMERGED ON
SOME CABLE NEWS STATION AND TOOK
A SHOT AT THE PRESIDENT'S
TWITTER HABITS.
TO FACE.
>> ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT NOT
UNLIKE DRAKE'S OBSERVATION
PEOPLE WITH TWITTER FINGERS
AREN'T AS HARD-CORE WHEN YOU
KEYBOARD.
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH SINBAD,
BUT LOOK AT HIS OWN STUFF.
HE'S STILL LIVING IN A DIFFERENT
WORLD OR ANOTHER WORLD.
LISTEN, WE DON'T LOOK AT HIM AS
A COMEDIAN.
WE LOOK AT HIM AS NOTHING BUT A
