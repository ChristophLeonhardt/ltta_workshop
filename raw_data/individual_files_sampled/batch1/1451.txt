hi I'm sorry okay in little over week Afghanistan's capital Kabul has been hit by four major attacks killing almost 150 people and pushing an already angry despair after more than 16 years of violence and political turmoil why does the war look no closer to ending we'll speak with a panel of Afghans to ask that question I'm Malika balada and here in this stream live on al Jazeera a on YouTube be sure to send us your comments and questions and we'll try to get them into today's show but before we start the conversation take a look at this video from our colleagues at aj+ enough said she suffered in did not patent society Georgia tomorrow dr. Muhammad I'm shooting so long which is poor honesty as you just saw there Afghan civilians are often the victims when bombs go off in Kabul and elsewhere the war in Afghanistan is complex attacks are carried out by groups including the Taliban and ISIL Afghan officials often blame Pakistan's intelligence services for the violence u.s. President Donald Trump has stepped up air raids talks are off the table and in fighting in Afghanistan's government divides its attention caught in the middle of this ordinary Afghan people are putting increasing pressure on all of the players to end the conflict but how realistic a prospect is that here with us to discuss omar summit is a former senior advisor to the chief executive of Afghanistan's and unity government dr. Abdullah Abdullah he's also the former Afghan ambassador to France and Canada on skype in San Francisco California Haroon our salah is an independent journalist and the founder of documenting afghanistan that is an online platform for Afghans to share their own stories Suleiman Suleiman kill is the co-founder and deputy CEO of hope education and leadership in Afghanistan or Heller for short a youth NGO promoting student leadership in Afghanistan and he lives in Kabul but joins us today from The Hague in the Netherlands and in Doha Qatar streamer Kazi is an online producer for aljazeera.com she often reports on Afghanistan and Pakistan welcome everybody you may remember at the end of that little video from aj+ it said what is going on in the country Haroon for your perspective a simple breakdown what's going on well I mean I just said that there's no incentive peace right now whether that's the the Taliban I is KP or or even that people join you the AMA so the short version is just that sooner man this is your home this is somewhere that's very dear to your heart if you were trying to explain to somebody outside of Afghanistan this last few weeks of extreme violence how would you tell them what was happening why is happening well it is a fuse that everyone is very sad about what has happened in Afghanistan but there is something that needs to be saved to the world and that it is that the world has finally come to a conclusion and they now know who to be playing who is to be blamed for all these things and who is to be named for all the things that happened in the country and now the world and the international community knows how to solve the problem and how to overcome this issue and that is something hopeful for us so I hear the hope in your voice but online people are not so sure Omar I'll direct the sweet to you this is from Issa and Rhys who says for most Afghans their primary desire is to live and not to die for that to happen the war needs to end the war continues because there's no understanding that we're in a stalemate both sides hang on to a delusional fiction that military victory is possible this is a stalemate according to this person what would you say about that from a military point of view it's a stalemate from a political point of view I think that we have reached a new stage in the political process that involves not only Afghanistan and Afghans internally but also the region around Afghanistan in the countries that feel that they have a big stake at what is happening in a forest on and then globally with the big powers like the US China Russia and many others who also consider themselves as stakeholders some like the u.s. NATO or are very deeply entrenched in Afghanistan have been for the last 17 years we have seen ups and downs and the Afghan people obviously at hopes that have not materialized so far and what needs to happen is to realize that we need we are at the defining moment meaning that we have to put the finger on what the cause the root cause of the problem is and then we need to pull together and find creative and realistic solutions to the problems that exist whether they are again political security economic even and political as well my you just stated the obvious well the obvious is not easy to deal with I may have stated the obvious but we need creativity listen seventeen years we've tried almost everything in the book nothing has really materialized Afghans are suffering more than ever before did you remember the last 3040 years we have suffered heavily during the Soviet occupation during Taliban the majority in every phase has had its own blood bath period right now the hopes that people had or being tested and I think that we need to rekindle hope in optimism in Afghanistan instead of you know trying to deal with abstractions and things that are real Trina I was checking out your Twitter feed from the weekend this let out at me could not catch up with the death toll when reporting on the suicide attack in Kabul today it was rising at a blazing speed every minute chilling how are you telling this story to an audience that have been following it for 17 years I think this time around the situation in Afghanistan is not just it's not just about the attacks it's also about how young people in Afghanistan are actually feeling that they're gonna die any moment I mean it for me as a journalist it's so shocking to be covering an event when something like there it's a pattern whenever I see whether it's in the summer or in the winter if we look at the recent years attacks like this happen one after the other one hundreds killed it's a pattern same thing happened last week a lot of people were killed in this attack before that intercontinental was under attack and I could not catch up with the numbers I was in touch with officials and they were giving numbers and I was like for me when it's so difficult to catch up on these numbers how would Afghans in Kabul who are actually facing the attacks are dealing with it so it's been happening it's been happening for a while now right now what's really sad is that the ovens are feeling that we're gonna die any moment and we need to be protected who is going to protect us trust the government yeah soon when do you feel that way III didn't feel that I was in Doha last week and then I was in Kabul for one day and when I was in Kabul I definitely felt the the situation there was not as normal as it was before nothing was normal there the people the people who were very sad and I couldn't see a smile a single smile on the face of anyone but let's deal with it wisely and the the wise way is to think about the solution that could be actual and I and by this I mean that this is not only a national issue this is not a an issue that Afghanistan can solve it but this is an issue that the international community jointly should solve it and that's why I said the word hope I know that there are fear I know that there the people are not happy I know that the people are going through a very bad situation and so I am and so other young Afghans are going through the situation but I see that there is progress I see that the international community is taking the right path I want to hear what that progress is give us one example yeah so one of the biggest examples of the progress could be the u.s. strategy United States strategy for Southeast Southeast Asia and also Afghanistan I mean in the country inside the country I am very involved with young people have very involved with the activities that carries young people in and all of them are very optimist about the new strategy all of them are very happy about that because in the new strategy that supports Afghanistan and that that could be the start of a change that could be the start of an end to this terrorism and you people are very disappointed with the United States I mean it's been you know next to 17 years here there's been you know nearly trillion dollars spent you could have paved the roads and gold and none of that stuff has happened right like there's no incentive like I was mentioning earlier for youth to not join armed groups whether that's the AMA the Taliban or is KP there is not some widespread kind of system being built to try to you know reach into the villages and how people go with education or just basic needs so they're not on the street begging and picking up garbage for a living so people are flooding out of this country right why why do we have so many people flooding in and out of this country right now who are all trying to get to the EU if things are going so great there absolutely I agree with the Haroon on that because the attacks that we've been witnessing as journalists and Afghans living in the country I think it underscores the fertility of sixteen year united states military campaign and I mean despite the fact that they've been fighting the Taliban for so long my question here to mr. Omer here is that if we're if we have to be creative about getting a solution to end this war what would it be I think we haven't tried talking to the Taliban yet Trump just recently said we're not going to have a conversation with the Taliban we I think in any case u.s. is not winning I think it's a good question let me first say that I think reality is lies somewhere between what both haruna Suliban said I think reality means that a lot of work has been done in Afghanistan we have seen progress in so many fields it's been reported everybody knows about it security has been one challenge and there is a reason for that the reason is that there are groups that have harnessed all that keep on fighting and those groups enjoy sanctuaries outside of Afghanistan but they also are there's this as fact dissatisfaction within the country and then there are there is weaknesses there are weaknesses institutional weaknesses corruption governance weaknesses as we talked and then poetic rifts that exist in society if you put all of this together it's a black-and-white picture but the reality is gray now coming up can I can I interrupt for a moment and ask you well okay so for the last 16 17 years we've all known that what's going on inside of Pakistan and that their funding and arming and you know helping with operations of militant activity inside of a LAN it's done this is everybody's known this you know anybody from a farmer to even you know the president has told in the United States that this is going on so it's been 16 years here so within the 16 years the United States paid billions upon billions to Pakistan so how is it that the United States didn't know this was going on the entire time when we told them directly so now so now we all know that the policy is changing we are in the middle of a transition in policy it's a five six month old policy it will take time I believe for it to be a problem for us and now we're going back to them to solve it for us this is a little bit strange to know well I mean I don't I don't think the United States can be blamed for 911 I don't think the United States can be blamed for creating this problem I think that there are regional players and regional dynamics that are at play i've horriston is a victim of his geography and that means geo political movements in dynamics play a huge role and have an impact on what is happening inside a harness or if you look at as a harness on history it's all about its geography now if I come back to Serena Serena's yeah question creative means that we have to set up an end goal the end goal is peace the end goal is stability and security therefore it means that we how do we reach that goal so far we have tried as I said before a lot of different options have been put under mr. Bush as under mr. Obama and now a new set of options with mr. Trump how do I guess we we have a live online community as well in this conversation so just pause for a moment so I can bring them back in Malika are you mentioned the end goal being peace and of course before we get to peace so there are people living their daily lives and struggling with that and so we wanted to check in with them on how they're going about that we got this comment via YouTube someone is watching live Pranava says clearly the military can't solve the problem people should take action to overcome their challenges rather than just hoping things will get better clearly also this is someone who is not in Afghanistan but people who are are doing things they're taking action in the way that they can this is a piece that you wrote shereena in case I die it's entitled why Afghans keep notes in their pockets and you spoke to several people residents of Kabul who are doing things like this they're writing their names on notes I have pulled up one on my screen here he writes his name where he was born his age so that what Sharia so if you look at the situation in Afghanistan right now it's not just the attacks that the Afghans are being killed in it's also the drones I have spoken to a lot of people a lot of ovens saying that their babies were killed in drones besides that they're also killed in protests by the police this happened in the summer on June 2nd when the when the protesters were demonstrating against the attacks in Kabul so it's not just it's not just the attacks conducted by ISIL or the Taliban they don't feel safe in the country they think that any moment we will step out of the house and we can get killed we can either get shot in a protest we can either get killed in a drone or we'll get killed by an ISIL or a Taliban attack so when I was talking to them about what the situation is in Kabul in Afghanistan in general and I was very shocked about the fact when they said we've started carrying a piece of papers now with us in case something happens to us our families it would be easy for our families to know where we are and find out if they need blood they'll be able to find blood for us if we're injured the reason they said that was because there were many bodies in the recent attack on the on the diplomatic area that were burned and they could not identify them so they the up ones are actually scared about the fact that if we die they it's gonna take them a lot of days to identify our bodies so we might as well just keep a few papers that can say who we are in our pockets in our purses in our jerseys in places like that where they know where they would know who we are so they're kind of feeling the sense of death in the country which is very which is very sad and it's and it's a bit shameful as well that they don't feel any sort of protection from the government or from the troops in the huntress arena so um she was yes you've just given us a reality check here for what it is like to live in Kabul to live in Afghanistan and live through those attacks let me show you this Oman because you picked up a story that we've been sharing on al-jazeera amazing story of courage you call it how can they be helped it's about a little fourteen-year-old boy this is a story that we reported on in December it's on Facebook on al-jazeera right now have a look now we said well you know but I recently spoke with a new personality I would different solution I was out taking the oil Padrino you see the number of people they're displaced by this conflict people online are pointing the fingers at some of those geopolitical actors that you talked about a little bit earlier Omar this is a tweet we got from Deepak he says the perpetrators of terror attacks in Afghanistan are mostly harbored and nurtured by Pakistan more precisely the Pakistan Army punitive sanctions on the Pakistan generals and businesses run by that military can significantly reduce terror attacks in Afghanistan that's one person's claim on the other decide though we had this tweet from Easton who you heard from a little bit earlier who says the US should learn from Pakistan how the peace can be brought to the conflict zone u.s. continuous desire to invade transoceanic countries is irresponsible destabilizing behavior and that Muhsin so someone's pointing the finger at Pakistan another person is pointing the finger at the u.s. haroon what do you make of those two comments okay well no I wouldn't say it's all of them it's not just the United States and Russia or United States and Pakistan or you know so we have China we have Iran we have all these surrounding countries that are involved there Saudi Arabia included they're all funny they're there you know their favorite villains but there's very few heroes enough honest on left they mostly died and were martyred so what we have left are people who who made it through and these are you know the people who are be but who were able to be bought people who were not bought by the United States or somebody else didn't really have back backing to stand their ground and continue to be the strongmen or whatever they are so right now what you're saying is the president my shivani trying to push out some of these people who were still remnants of these kind of past days but we have all these different actors all these different countries playing their games instead of all honest on with our blood I think we cannot blame the US for for the last year yes I agree that we should blame the u.s. and the international community for the past 16 years but for the last one year their role has been significant their contribution has been very important we cannot just stay discipline state disappointed we cannot continue disappointment and that's not the right Donald Trump is often fascist right so if we had guns believe him to have our best interest in mind we're very delusional is other is other the other thing that he has done we're talking about the the interest of Afghanistan you know so one is that we don't have friends in the international community once we believe this once understand this we're gonna have to work on our own be self-determined these type of things right create self sustainability we don't have those kind of so we do get it why did you sort of get away from this blame game and looking at this issue from a black-and-white perspective you know there are those who are trying to help and I think the f1 people know who's there to help you're those who are trying to hurt and I think they are fun people know who's there to hurt over all these years we have learned our lessons and there are those who make mistakes so the f1 people also know who's making a mistake and so we have learned you have to learn from this I shoulda said something earlier that I want to put in perspective no one has drawn the city no one has used a drone specifically on purpose against civilians civilians have been killed by drone attacks on occasion in certain parts of Afghanistan but it's immersed in the pool when the trolls are actually Airport the drones actually have been used specifically against terrorist outfits along the border with Pakistan if you look at the record and I urge everyone to look at the record you see that drones are being used and mistakes have been made but drawers not be used against terrorist outfits right at the end of this show what was that one point you were trying to make a head first what are you saying is that that are the United States hasn't killed people inside of Kabul that's not accurate this just happens because just a year ago I did a report on how the drones were the drones actually attacked a civilian area and Allah kids were killed in that area not a single terrorist was killed and I had actually investigated that absolutely everyone knows that the mistakes I've been here I mean let's move beyond what we were trying to call isolated incidents because they're not obviously Ashura and her work has shown that this is a pattern but you were mentioning the good guy yes hold tight for a minute we're literally right at the end of the show hold tight because we're going to have to take this conversation online and Malika how people reacting to our discussion it will end with this tweet from Jalal who says the only solution to peace in Afghanistan is talks with the Taliban and of course that is controversial it's also I know that's that would lead to a whole other topic I mean this this conflict is been going on for 17 years there's no way in 25 minutes we can address all of the points but Thank You Omar Haroon Suleiman and Shriner for bringing your best efforts and helping us understand it a little bit more from what of your perspectives now al jazeera's ongoing coverage of afghanistan is on a dedicated page to go to aljazeera.com and search for al jazeera Afghanistan thank you so much our conversation always continues at hashtag eight a stream week and I will see you there take everybody you
