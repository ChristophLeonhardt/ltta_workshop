FOR THE PRESIDENT AND HIS
ADMINISTRATION BUT TRUMP
SUPPORTERS AS WELL AS WE
REVEALED IN THIS TEXT MESSAGES.
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE
PROGRAM.
THE BAD NEWS FOR THE FBI DOES
NOT END THERE.
THE AGENCY WAS ARRESTED BY
LAWMAKERS, AND AT TIMES BY THE
DOJ INSPECTOR GENERAL DURING A
FIERY SENATE HEARING EARLIER
TODAY.
>> THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM
WITH THE CULTURE AT FBI
HEADQUARTERS.
>> IT JUST SEEMED TO BE A
CULTURE OF IMPUNITY, WHERE THE
RULES DID NOT APPLY.
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS
HAPPENED TO MY FBI.
>> I CAN'T THINK OF SOMETHING
MORE CONCERNING WHEN A
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER
SUGGESTING OR THEY WERE GOING TO
USE THEIR POWERS TO AFFECT AN
ELECTION.
>> JOHN SUMMERS, COMMUNICATION
DIRECTORS FOR
SENATOR HARRY REID.
BYRON, YOU AND I HAVE SPOKEN A
LOT LEADING UP TO THAT HEARING
TODAY, WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT
CULTURE OF THE FBI?
>> NOW YOU HAD REPUBLICANS
MAKING THEIR CASE THAT AND THAT
YOU ARE DISCUSSING THAT WITH
CONGRESSMAN RADCLIFFE.
CLINGING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
MICHAEL HOROWITZ DID SAY THAT HE
DID NOT SEE ANY DOCUMENTARY OR
TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE OF BIAS IN
THE SPECIFIC DECISION, WHETHER
OR NOT TO PROSECUTE
HILLARY CLINTON.
BUT BASICALLY, HOROWITZ DID SAY
THERE WERE TONS OF TONS OF BIAS
HERE AND REPUBLICANS TOOK IT
FROM THERE.
>> Sandra: JOHN, THIS IS THE
FBI.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOOK ON FROM
THIS AND IF THEY WANT TO HAVE
FULL CONFIDENCE IN THE FBI.
THAT NEEDS TO BE RESTORED TO
COME UP WILL IT?
>> I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.
FIRST WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, IT'S A
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE NOT THE ENTIRE
AGENCY OF 37000.
IT'S SAD TO SEE THIS DEPARTMENT
HAVING THE BABY THROWN OUT WITH
THE BATHWATER ON THIS ONE
BECAUSE, AS BYRON JUST SAID,
MOST PEOPLE ARE HARDWORKING
PEOPLE WHO WORK TO KEEP THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE.
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD
CONSIDER THE FBI A   AND ABOLISH
CONSIDER THE FBI A   AND ABOLISE
CONSIDER THE FBI A   AND ABOLIST
OF LIBERALISM.
IN FACT IF YOU ASK ANYONE AROUND
WHO THEY ARE VOTING FOR, THEY
WILL TELL YOU IT'S TRUMP.
SO WHILE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A
CULTURE ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE
INVESTIGATED, THAT'S NOT
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE APPLIED
TO THE ENTIRE FBI.
IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT CAME
OUT OF THIS HEARING, IT IS THAT
THERE WAS NO DEEP STATE
CONSPIRACY ORTH PLOT AGAINST THE
PRESIDENT OR HIS CAMPAIGN.
AND I'M SORRY THAT REPUBLICANS
DON'T LIKE IT.
BUT CONCLUSIONS DO MATTER.
IF WE ARE GOING TO TRUST THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL WHO IS
SUPPOSED TO TAKE THIS NONBIASED
APPROACH, THEN WHO DO WE TRUST?
>> Sandra: I WANT TO GET BYRON
TO RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE I
KNOW WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU
EARLIER.
EARLIER, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
PETER STRZOK AND WHETHER OR NOT
HE WAS OFFICIALLY GOING TO
TESTIFY.
NOW NOT ONLY TO SEE PETER STRZOK
UP THERE AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS
TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, BUT
FINALLY HEAR THE STORIES.
I MEAN THIS COULD BE VERY
REVEALING TESTIMONY.
>> EXACTLY.
FIRST ON THE ISSUE OF IT BEING A
HANDFUL TO THE PEOPLE IN
EVOLVED, MAYBE THERE WAS A
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE BUT
UNFORTUNATELY THEY INCLUDED THE
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI, AND THAT
THE DIRECTOR OF THE     FBI ANDT
THE DIRECTOR OF THE     FBI ANDE
THE DIRECTOR OF THE     FBI ANDL
THE DIRECTOR OF THE     FBI ANDA
THE DIRECTOR OF THE     FBI ANDD
INVESTIGATOR.
VERY IMPORTANT HANDFUL.
NOW LAWMAKERS HAVE BEEN TRYING
FOR MONTHS TO GET THIS TO
HAPPEN.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT
MORE THAN JUST BIASED QUESTIONS
ABOUT PETER STRZOK.
REMEMBER, HE ACTUALLY LED THE
TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION WHEN
IT WAS IN JULY OF 2016 ALL THE
WAY THROUGH MAY 2017, WHEN HE
JOINED THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION
JOINED THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION M
JOINED THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION E
JOINED THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION L
JOINED THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION R
INVESTIGATION.
SOME LAWMAKERS WILL SAY, WE KNOW
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE TRUMP.
HOW DID THIS INVESTIGATIONS
START?
TRIAL, I CAN TELL ABOUT GEORGE
PAPADOPOULOS.
TELL US ABOUT THE TRUMP EMPLOYEE
SEEKING INFORMATION.
TELL US ABOUT SEEKING
INFORMANTS.
THERE'S A LOT THAT LAWMAKERS
WANT TO KNOW THEM.
>> Sandra: HIS LAWYER SAID HE
IS WILLING TO TESTIFY, HE WILL
NOT PLEAD THE FIFTH.
DO YOU EXPECT HIS FINAL WORD TO
YOU, JOHN COME TO BE REVEALING?
>> I HOPE THE ONE OF THE FIRST
THINGS HE DOES WHEN HE GETS UP
THERE IS PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND AN
APOLOGY FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE
ABOUT CRACK CASTING THE SHADOW
ON THE FBI.
THE REALITY IS, YOU CAN TALK
ABOUT BIAS AND WHAT LED UP TO
THE INVESTIGATION STARTING, AND,
YOU HAVE TO TRUST THAT HE'S
DOING THE RIGHT THING.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, EVIDENCE
MATTERS.
LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT
THAT 13 RUSSIANS WERE INDICTED
AS A RESULT OF THIS PROCESS SO
THIS INVESTIGATION MATTERS, IT'S
IMPORTANT AND WE SHOULD LET IT
GO ON.
>> I THINK THAT EVIDENCE IS WHAT
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TALKED
ABOUT TODAY.
