1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
The State of the
Union address has

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,260
been televised since Harry
Truman was president.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,180
“What we do or fail to do 
at home affects

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,010
not only ourselves, 
but millions throughout the world.”

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,470
But it was Ronald
Reagan who understood

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,410
how to make the event
appeal to a wider audience.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,180
His secret weapon: 
Lenny Skutnik.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,200
On a freezing January
day in 1982,

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,360
Lenny Skutnik dived
into the Potomac River

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,610
to save a survivor
of a plane crash.

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,240
Television cameras immortalized
the heroic act.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,410
About a month later,

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,770
Skutnik sat in Congress
next to the first lady

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,350
and Reagan pointed him out
for those watching his State

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,940
of the Union address from home.

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,790
“Just two weeks ago,

17
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,630
in the midst 
of a terrible tragedy

18
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,630
on the Potomac,

19
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,780
we saw again, 
the spirit of American

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,280
heroism at its finest.”

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,780
Skutnik was an everyman.
People could relate to him.

22
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,820
And his dramatic rescue also
satisfied America’s hunger

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,620
for storytelling.

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,410
His fame soon faded,
but his legacy endures.

25
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,019
Reagan
successors continue

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,990
to invite unsung heroes
to their addresses.

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,060
These special
guests, often called

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,510
‘Lenny Skutniks,’ have ranged
from civil rights advocates ...

29
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,150
“When a woman named
Rosa Parks sat

30
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,890
down on a bus in Alabama.”

31
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,830
... to everyday heroes.

32
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,890
“Jackie Bray

33
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,340
is a single mom from North
Carolina who was laid off

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,810
from her job as a mechanic.”

35
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,150
But in recent years
guests have taken

36
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,470
a more partisan role like former
Afghan interim leader Hamid

37
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,510
Karzai in 2002.

38
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,820
Or an empty seat left 
for victims of gun violence in 2016.

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
As with most things in
Washington, who will be invited

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,790
is steeped in politics
as presidents sometimes

41
00:01:44,790 --> 00:00:00,000
use guests as symbols
of their own policies.
