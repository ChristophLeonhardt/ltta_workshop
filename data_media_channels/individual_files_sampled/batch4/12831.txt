more and more universities are signing on to speech codes to make sure college is a safe place where people can hear new ideas without ever hearing any new ideas students have to be able to learn how to have free and open discussions without discussing things and a free and open way in this manner we can educate our young to get to the truth without ever saying anything that would offend anyone like the truth for instance one visiting assistant professor at a Mercer University journalism school says we should stop using the word terrorism because it might imply that an act of violence that just happened to be committed by a Muslim in the name of Allah in the cause of jihad was somehow connected to any particular religion using the T word might make em word students feel they were no longer welcome to walk into the local pizzeria say and relax with friends by shouting a word a word and then blowing themselves to F word H word according to a handout from the University of California you should be careful not to say to an asian student why are you so quiet this is tantamount demanding that the asian student assimilate to the dominant culture you might have hurt the asian person's feelings and yet you would never know it because he won't tell you because he's so dead quiet it's almost impossible to figure out what those people are thinking they're just inscrutable so be careful what you say to them also don't turn your back on them a guidebook from the University of New Hampshire says students should not describe someone as healthy but should instead say that he's a non disabled individual in the same way you might refer to people who can see is non blind and too tall people as non short this way non disabled individuals won't offend any gimpy midgets who accidentally bump into them because they're not non blind the same guidebook also advises student students to avoid quote gendering a non gender activity for example and this is a real example they should not refer to their parents as mother and father because that suggests one of them impregnated the other and the other carried the child to term for nine months in his or her womb and then delivered it through his or her vagina in the future students should simply refer to their parents as people being ripped off for too much tuition to have their children turned into idiots at Smith College the student newspaper decided it should no longer use the word crazy because it privileged people who didn't happen to think that their breakfast cereal formed the face that was secretly laughing at them every time they turned away to drink their orange juice which it obviously was doing the newspaper staff agreed it would no longer use crazy or any other word or phrase that would represent the world as it actually is from now on the newspaper staff decided it will only use phrasing intended to deceive their audience into believing the editors personal political opinions represent reality after making this decision the staff was immediately hired by ABC News trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Klavan show not shortly exactly like not non-disabled I mean that well that's a thing now is it oh the world has gone mad and I have to say that you know what we're going to talk about this we're going to talk about the craziness of the left today and tomorrow's mail bag day so after you have your 15 minutes of Facebook time come to the daily wire and then watch and as you're listening to us subscribe and as you subscribe you can then put

wrote a piece a few days ago a guy named George Freeman in geopolitical futures com it was called not much as new in this election and he says as usual each candidate and their partisans are predicting total catastrophe of the other wins there are also claims that there has never been an election like this in history as is normally the case the candidate of the party out of power is claiming that the United States has reached a catastrophic point because of the current government the other candidate is saying that the country is not collapsing but that it will collapse if the opposition's candidate is elected this is pretty normal stuff including the belief by much of the public that there has never been such an election before but that is wrong there have been others with much more at stake the point I am making is that the impression that there has never been an election like this one is common in every election cycle and charges that one of the candidates is a criminal and the other is psychotic have been standard fare in American elections my standard is whether a lectin either candidate will cause a civil war short of that it is safe to conclude that the Republic will survive either of them and the one elected whoever it is might surprise us now that you know that's a really interesting take and it's actually my take through most of history most of my life I sit and think you know this is that before we'll get through it and i think and i definitely think we'll get through this i don't think this is the end necessarily of the Republic I do think however that it is true that these two people are a criminal and a psychotic I mean I think these are the two worst people that I've ever seen I mean I've seen a lot of elections and I've never seen two people like this who are truly damaged individuals and it says something about the country and the state of the country that they're the nominees and it says something about the process it says something about us that we would nominate them but there was a piece in The New York Times yesterday I think just saying that nine percent of the people had had it you know had a voice in this nine percent of the people had nominated these people people maybe that's what it comes down to it really comes down to the fact that somehow we've developed this process where so few people are participating and you know it's funny conservatives are fond of pointing out that this is not supposed to be democracy it's supposed to be a republic there's supposed to be a lot of checkpoints between the people and power and that logic fell apart almost immediately you know that fell apart really when the founding fathers passed as they started to pass from the scene Andrew Jackson was elected and Andrew Jackson you know John Quincy Adams looked at that was a or Samuel I'm sorry were the John Adams son looked at that and said this is insane this guy is allowed you know this is a terrible thing to elevate this guy and a lot of people have compared him to Donald Trump which I find absurd because Andrew Jackson was in fact a guy who basically won the Indian Wars at the Battle of shubh end and fought off the British of course in the Battle of New Orleans and so he had actually accomplished a lot of heroic stuff and the people there was a reason for the people to elevate and the point that they did these people are nuts these two people I gotta say that I the stuff that happened over the weekend and that is still going on is frankly appalling you know so this this thing with Trump is still reverberating the media now think they've got him you know there's been all this all these moments in the Trump campaign when the media said this is it he called the judge a Mexican we've got him you know is that he made fun of a reporter for being handy yet we've got we've got him now and he keeps you know he keeps slipping away he's like the guy in the cartoon you know with one leap the Dirk was free you know I truck this bit like that he keeps getting out of these these coils but this time see he's not dealing with nine percent of the people he's now dealing with everybody and people are starting to pay attention and what he did was pretty bad now he's blaming the preso he have Trump comes out and he talks about how the presses mistreated them is the first trunk up the biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media we have a media that is so dishonest that no matter what makes no difference but these are among the most dishonest people you'll ever ever meet these people you know I've had days where I said boy this was a great day I look forward to seeing you tonight or tomorrow and it's brutal I say what happened but we're gonna punch through the media we have to the New York Times is totally dishonest totally dishonest Washington Post's been a little bit better lately but not good by the way New York Times which is failing really failing badly which i call it the failing New York Times every story they right is a hit job I could do the greatest thing in the history of the world I could come up with a cure for the most horrible disease in the world and they give me a front-page horrible horrible story the New York Times very dishonest but it'll be out of business soon I all right fat check true the New York Times has become a terrible newspaper when I call in the former newspaper I'm not kidding they used to be a great paper I mean conservatives always complained about the new york times whenever they did a real study you know back in the old days we're talking about the sixties and seventies you know whenever they did a real study of their bias they came out pretty fairly this is not they op-ed page this is the front page now Trump is absolutely right they score I mean it's almost comic it's like a it's like a broadsheet that some lefty is handing out anti-trump so that's one thing he said that was true and the other one was this he was talking about Bernie Sanders conceding to Hillary Clinton he made this comment if he would have just not done anything just go home go to sleep relax he would have been a hero but he made a deal with the devil she's the devil he made a deal with the fact check true that's all but here's the thing I mean not only do they hate Trump but they also cover for Hillary Clinton I mean only all the coverage this stuff is getting put but the chart up about how much coverage but this is how much coverage Patricia Smith speech got about her son who died at Benghazi versus how much coverage you know Kaiser con got for his son who died in Iraq and it's obvious the difference I mean this is these this media is incredibly dishonest and but but the problem is just because the media is are dishonest doesn't mean the Trump is not a skunk I mean this was a horrible thing to say and this thing that he said you know let me read to you a little bit of Bret Stevens column this morning and Stevens is making what will call the Shapiro case that basically this guy is so bad that to sign on with him at all even if it means you know beating Hillary Clinton is basically to condemn yourself and the Republican Party to Perdition forever and here's Stephens making this argument he says there's an old saying that in politics there are no permanent victories and no permanent defeats Barry Goldwater was crushed in 1964 but the ideas that animated his Candace candidacy found new life in the reagan revolution of 1980 Bill Clinton declared the era of big government was over in 1996 and 14 years later we got Obamacare the inevitable turning of the policy wheel should comfort conservatives unnerved by the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency liberals overreach statist solutions fail voters tire of one-party rule to govern is to own and the next president will own the next recession the next foreign policy fiasco the next Veterans Affairs scandal if mrs. Clinton is everything Republicans say she is an opportunistic dishonest incompetent left-wing ideologue they can at least look forward to a one-term presidency I know I do and I know many people by the way who say that she won't even make it through one term that if the Republicans hold on to Congress they will impeach her they'll get rid of her and and the press will actually turn on her they will not do what they did for Barack Obama because of this pathology we have about race that the first black president had to be a saint even if he was a scandal-ridden you know demagogue he had to be a saint because he was black they will not do that with the first female president because it's just not the same thing women have not been treated in this country the way blacks were in fact treated and so there she's not going to have that kind of cover and they don't like her personally Stevens goes on to say but to say there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics doesn't mean there is no permanent dishonor Huey Long Charles Coughlin Alger Hiss Joe McCarthy and Bull Connor are the foul names of America's 20th century and always will be and those who supported and excuse them will always be tainted by association and he goes on to talk about what you know what it meant when Trump in that obvious tick he obviously couldn't stop himself when after mrs. Khan for not saying anything in see he was suggesting I felt very obviously that because she was Muslim she was being silenced and that that ugly little thing he did where he said you know a lot of people have said this is just me like I I'd like I've like a list I'd like a list of names you know and and so the you do get polluted I mean we've talked about this a lot that one of the reasons I was so desperate for Trump not to be nominated is because he is what the MSM says we are he is what Democrats always say we are he is a blundering you know kind of bigoted you know demagogue he is that guy that they always said if they said mitt romney was and we keep saying well yeah you said the same thing about Mitt Romney right but the even in the story of the boy who cries wolf the wolf does show up and that's the problem with Donald Trump you know take a look for a minute this is what happens to people when they attach themselves to a human being instead of principle okay especially if it's a bad human being like Donald Trump Mike Pence vice presidential candidate gives a he has a campaign event and a military mom stands up to speak and she asks a question Thank You mr. Pence's time and time again Trump has disrespected our nation's armed forces and veterans and is disrespect for mr. Khan and his family's dismissive okay how do you talk see here's this woman got up at a public event a campaign event and she asked a question she asked it in a civilized way she had she's obviously not a trump supporter she's a military mom and now these guide her like she's a villain in a pantomime you know that's how you get that's what it looks like to be corrupted by following a person instead of a principle and listen to pence respond with genuine decency well I thank you for the question it's all right it's all right folks that's what that's what freedom looks like and that's a freedom sounds line okay let me just say first I want to honor your son service to the country and your families let me say I know this has been much in the news of late in the last few days but as I said last night as Donald Trump said with Saturday night captain Kahn is an American hero and we honor him and honored his family as we do all the things we can stop it there and he basically comes around he talks about the heroic death of captain camera shot apparently was genuinely heroic chasing people away from a car a cab before it blew up what's so sad about this I mean you see pence bringing people back to their better selves you know reminding them that this is this course this is what freedom looks like it looks like people asking questions that are uncomfortable we don't have to boo them down we want to shout them down he's perfectly capable of answering the question for himself he goes on to talk about Trump's dedication to the military and do the vice presidential thing that he does but what's really disturbing about this is this used to be normal discourse this used to be what we expected what they used to be I'm talking about four years ago this used to be what we expected of our politicians is it phony as a hypocritical who cares this is what civilized people behave with one another you know part of hypocrisy in what do they call it the tribute that vice pays to virtue you know it's it's the thing that you do because you showing people how we are supposed to behave and that's what Pence is doing and good on in but Trump is incapable of doing that that was just an example of how people get corrupted by following you know by following a person instead of a principle it happened on the other side as well you know Robbie Mook the camp oh I forgot to say goodbye to Facebook so farewell Facebook come today lee weyer and hear the rest so you know Robbie look was the campaign director of the Clinton campaign he's dealing with the fact that Hillary Clinton lied again when asked about her emails and just just the same it was the same thing just the same way the Trump because he's got this sociopathic need to fight back against his critics she lies by nature she cannot help herself she just does it and here's Mook being corrupted by that because he now has to follow those lies he can't go out and say to his boss is you know was lying that was stupid what you know what a dope he's talking to chuck Scarborough here and he's humiliated basically what director Comey said was that he believes there was no basis for her to believe that the emails in question that you're referring to that she had any reason to believe that that they were classified upset he said a reasonable person in her position should have known they were classified even if they weren't marked well but that's leaving out the fact that these emails were coming from hundreds of State Department employees these are long time tenured State Department professionals work for different administrations this isn't you know these these folks are not partisan they were the one sending her the emails she he in his mind but he had no real that position though because they had no other outlet to communicate with her so you can't really put the blame on State Department professionals if the leader of their organization is staying email us at this address this is all the only option you have well classified information is sent over a completely separate system so it was their decision to send oh yeah i know that i worked at the state well there you go neither sadness it even worse though she was forcing everybody that wanted to communicate with her to move out of the classified realm where you send classified information and then put it on their own servers consented to well isn't that even worse well and you to understand this that's simply not true you do just don't send classified information over the unclassified system and they know that did you would you would under yeah you would understand this the FBI director said she did I mean it really is despicable not just to continue the lie but to blame the people of the State Department most of whom were just civil service workers you know to blame them for sending the she first and now he is blaming them for sending the emails to the only address they had to send them to you know they had to send him to her private emails now she's blaming them for doing that yeah how could they how could they be so stupid as to send those secret classified documents to my private email which was the only way they could reach me you know it's not is it not as if she was Secretary of State at the time she was you know this is it's awful and now this guy is blue so here here is Ron Fournier who's a Clinton supporter and he wrote a piece called why can't Hillary stop lying in the Atlantic because because I see a lot of people doing this with Trump to a lot of people are saying gee yeah you know what's your name oh I can't remember a name FN but like many Trump supporters are saying why won't he just concentrate laura ingram laura ingram was saying why can t just concentrate on Hillary's record if he could just stick to her record and stop these personal stupid attacks he would win why Kenny and here's Ron Fournier wondering the same thing about Hillary Clinton she did violate policy we know that she did expose us secrets on a rogue sir Ron White as we know it another way wait wait why did she lie when she knew she was lying and she knew that everybody knew that she was like why didn't she just brush it off and say I made mistakes I'm terribly sorry I've been chasing by the FBI director I didn't break any laws but sometimes I have to hold myself to a higher standard I won't make the same a second why can't you say that her own supporters are asking that question I don't know that's been a mystery now for what has been 18 months that I think she'd put the selection away a long time ago as she had come clean on email now all she's got to do especially after last week look she had a great convention a very aspirational message and nicely tucking in the argument that Trump is not fit to be President argument that I really agree with that a lot of Democrats a lot of independence even a lot of Republicans agree with that he would be a bad man to be President so all she's got to do now is get out of her own way why why why underscore what the one thing is it's holding her back from being president which is how dishonest she's been about the scandal it's because that's who she is she can't do it any more than Trumpkin stopped I mean these are two pathological people and despite what the fellow was saying that they we've had these people and there's always one who's being called a criminal and one who's being called a psychotic these before actually pathologically criminal and pathologically social you know a sociopath I mean they really are these people and I'm not saying it's the end of the Republic but I will say this i will say this to my fellow conservatives and to my fellow Republicans you know all these years all these years people have been saying to me they lie the mainstream media lies our university professors lie are you know our entertainment media lie they do and they do and why do we let them why don't we lie back why they fight why don't we fight back and the reason is because we are the good guys you can't beat the bad guys by lying you the bad guys lie because that's their the bad guys you know we have to win with the truth we have to win with the truth because it's all we've got it's all we got and yes does that mean you know this this truth get kicked around does it get beaten up does it get crucified yes it does but it always comes back and it does occasionally win and when it wins you can have like when Reagan one you can have like 25 good years just by turning the ship in that direction it took them a long time it took several presidencies to turn the ship back around in this destructive direction all you need is to win with the truth you know if we win with Trump we haven't won we haven't won anything you'll say oh we've saved the Supreme Court maybe maybe we have but as Stephen says you know these victories don't last as long things can surprise you you know we have to we have to fight with the truth and win with the truth or die with it we have nothing else on our side so let's talk about the culture some more you know I want to talk more about the culture because I feel that that's where the I feel that Hillary Clinton gonna win at this point that's the way it looks or poles are really good I don't see how Trump comes back from this I could be wrong I'm not predicting anything I'm just saying that's the way it looks right now that means that our fight is in the culture and actually that's true whether Hillary winds are not because even if Trump wins the fight for conservatism by which I mean freedom by which I mean freedom in small government limited government to let the individual be free is going to take place in the culture so I want to talk about the thing one of the things that conservatives do is they're always condemning movies that people love because they have bad things in them and they sell bad values and I was talking yesterday about Bonnie and Clyde a movie that romanticizes violence and takes these two hideous murderous thugs and turns them into beautiful romantic characters and what do you do how do you respond to a work of art that is a work of art that is a beautiful movie that does certain bad things and I was talking about the fact that in my journey to becoming a Christian one of the things that turned me away from atheism was reading the Marquis de saw this hideous pornographic sadistic philosopher of genius who who put forward and a an argument for atheism that I thought was the only argument for atheism I've ever heard that actually held together now somebody on the comments section of the podcast was attacking me for saying he says I used this one crazy dude as the spokesman for all atheists ideals and I didn't do that at all it was in a course of reading a lot of atheist philosophers and picking them apart because their theories didn't hold together that I came upon sod and realized oh yeah this guy holds together and he's evil yet home and this and this atheistic philosophy journeys into evil if you follow it logically by the way when people put comments saying that I say stupid somebody said you say keep saying stupid things and then he says something that I didn't actually say I just think me you know you're hearing stupid things and that's a very different different problem so that but that experience which I outlined in my memoir the great good thing that experience gives me has given me a lot of patience with great works that seem evil to us and that's why I don't condemn things and call for censorship and all this stuff because I fine feel that if something is a great work of art even if it's a good work of art there is a path to truth in it but you are responsible for finding it because the artist may be a jackass talent is blind you know the artist may be evil and as desaad was an evil guy so you know so I was thinking about this idea of violence and I love violence stories i write violence stories I mean I'm the thriller writer i write stories we're with tough guys and and bad women who do terrible things to one another and they're exciting and all this stuff and it's how to react to violence as a metaphor because we see this you know one of the i worked in the tough guy genre i still work kind of in the tough guy genre and and it started the tough guy genre that started with like Sam Spade Dashiell Hammett's detective Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Raymond Chandler's great novels about Philip Marlowe was really an attempt to rebuild the moral logic of the West after World War one after World War one it seemed like what was this culture about that would just wipe out a generation of men over nothing you know and Christianity came into disrepute at that point and the entire ideas of the West Cayman and that's when the left really started its destructive rise because they were filling in this gap you know there was this continent in ruins this generation laid waste for nothing and so some of these writers were trying to rebuild a moral framework which the left had had through Christianity and which was now gone and Sam Spade was an existentialist who brought justice because it was just kind of the thing to do but Raymond Chandler was different Raymond Chandler had within himself the ideal of the night the chivalrous idea of the night that he contained within himself even in the corrupt Los Angeles in which he worked and that was the idea of the tough guy but since all ideas become more themselves over time the tough guy ultimately became a really violent justice Springer in the form of this is the stuff I like Mickey Spillane who wrote the famous Mike Hammer novels which were among the biggest best sellers of their time I think at one point he had seven novels on the bestseller list and his hero was Mike Hammer and his first novel was I the jury and it's a brilliant brilliant tough-guy novel but extremely violent and Mike Hammer is not like a gentleman like Philip Marlowe he's not even a thinking man like Sam Spade he is just a brute and he comes in and he questions a guy and if the guy doesn't give him answer he done answer he grabs him by the crotch and he doesn't like send he doesn't send you know people to prison he just blows them away and we know this character we know him we've seen him in death wish what you know woman's love them in Thelma and Louise and that violence you think about Thelma and Louise if you ever go back and watch that they kill a rapist in that movie who's already put his hands up he's unarmed he's put his hands up and they blow him away and women cheer women cheer well are they really cheering for that with a cheer for that happened in real life some of them would probably but not but not all of them not a lot of them I think most civilized people would say now the guy puts his hand up you gotta arrest him you got to bring him in so the violence becomes a metaphor and what does it become a metaphor becomes a metaphor for justice it becomes a metaphor for morale and that is the point above the Mike Hammer stories he has a lot of stories where he acts as the judge jury and executioner so the titles were things like I the jury vengeance is mine my gun is quick those were the titles of them and it was about the fact that no he was not going to live in the world as if there was no moral order he was going to bring moral order to the world that he lived in the postwar world that he lived in and now his post World War 2 by that by that time I Rand was a big fan of Mike Hammer of Mickey Spillane and in one of her cruelest acts I think she published a comparison of a paragraph of Mickey Spillane who was despised that the left hated Mickey Spillane that the Intelligencia they aided him and so she published a paragraph of his next to their famous their favorite writer who who had this very florid style and they both were describing New York in the rain and she just posted the two of them together and spelling was obviously the better writer he was obviously the better writer so I the jury take a look at it it's a violent tough mean story but it uses violence as a metaphor and a lot of times when people do that is a lot of argument in the newspapers in the press about are we supporting vigilantism no we're supporting morality and in the violence in the story is a metaphor and they have to read it that way in order to understand what the guy is talking about and it if we don't approach the arts that way then we wind up always as what I call grandpa smukke fuddy-duddy we always wind up going to that's not going to watch that I'm gonna watch the movies on Turner classics Doris Day and John Wayne who's were movie sucked and you just make yourself irrelevant to the culture as it is and some there's some great work being produced in the culture alright we're going to talk more about that tomorrow and more about this insane situation we're in the ship is sinking but we're going to walk on water this is a true Clavin and this is the Andrew Klavan show see you tomorrow
