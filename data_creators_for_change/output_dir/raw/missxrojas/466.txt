00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009
after launching my video<font color="#E5E5E5"> project sorry</font>

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't drive the inevitable question</font>

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,160
emerged why have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you never learned how</font>

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,379
to drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> why do you seem not to want to</font>

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,849
learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to drive there are lots of</font>

6
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,440
different reasons as to why I don't want

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,429
to learn to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive so I'm just going to</font>

8
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,840
speak about a few of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them today but a</font>

9
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,490
big one is money it's incredibly

10
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,049
expensive to learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drive you have</font>

11
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,789
to pay for drives lessons there isn't a

12
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,529
car I can practice on at home so i would

13
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to either buy one for cheap or just</font>

14
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,430
practice using the instructors car which

15
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,199
would be more expensive and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

16
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,760
pay to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take the test you have to pay for</font>

17
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,859
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory materials</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and once you get</font>

18
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,570
your license you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to pay for road</font>

19
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,308
tax if you do decide to get a car you

20
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,200
have to pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> insurance for petrol and</font>

21
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,520
all these other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm sure</font>

22
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,260
haven't been thought about yet secondly

23
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">a big thing is obviously the environment</font>

24
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,399
I have a big environmental concern even

25
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">though certainly hypocritically know</font>

26
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,210
incredibly hypocritically I'm flying

27
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,579
basically everywhere oh and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm taking</font>

28
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,530
lots of coaches and things I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

29
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,170
keep my environmental carbon footprint

30
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,030
down to minimum and I wouldn't be able

31
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,829
to afford a car like a hybrid or like an

32
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,870
electric car because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'd just be so so</font>

33
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,280
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more expensive it would be very</font>

34
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,500
easy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to just say the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why I</font>

35
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,300
don't drive is because I live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> London</font>

36
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,890
and that's a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of it I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lived</font>

37
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,390
in London my whole life apart from

38
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">university I probably will end up living</font>

39
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,470
there because I love it to pieces and i

40
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,380
love how well-connected it is even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if i</font>

41
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't end up settling down in london on</font>

42
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably settle down in europe in</font>

43
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,729
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love the feeling that trains</font>

44
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,619
just connect you everywhere I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

45
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,330
public transport is so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love that</font>

46
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can cycle everywhere I love these</font>

47
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">things and i love that in some ways</font>

48
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,040
they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> better even though</font>

49
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,750
public transport costs are going up and

50
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,360
up and up the joy of public transport<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

51
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,860
something that I believe comes from a

52
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,930
hybrid of my parents my dad has always

53
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,970
loved trains I didn't always understand

54
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,950
why that was he's given away quite a few

55
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them now but he's have all these like</font>

56
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,610
model tracks and things we had a little

57
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,710
kids one behind me down from my<font color="#E5E5E5"> sisters</font>

58
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,659
to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> where my dad first brought</font>

59
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,119
home Harry Potter when I was six I was

60
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">very skeptical because I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought the</font>

61
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,360
reason why he bought it and to this day

62
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,799
I still really the reason why he bought

63
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,689
it was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the UK edition of</font>

64
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:55,799
harry potter and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the philosopher's stone</font>

65
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,869
has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> trainer cover now I've learned to</font>

66
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:58,920
really really love trains that

67
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,270
experience was kind of rushing through

68
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,219
the country and seeing these beautiful

69
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,049
landscapes kind of unfold around you and

70
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,549
the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of that is to do with my</font>

71
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,020
mother who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an incredibly social</font>

72
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,300
person and has<font color="#E5E5E5"> always told me never to</font>

73
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,770
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid to start up a conversation</font>

74
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,210
with

75
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,680
one last people about their lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

76
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,600
ask people<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions almost cross that</font>

77
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,480
personal space area that the UK so loves

78
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,950
this lovely<font color="#CCCCCC"> school has stood me in</font>

79
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,390
really good stead and this was never

80
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,830
more obvious than when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to San</font>

81
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,960
Diego two summers ago I stayed with some

82
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,550
aunts and uncles who live in San Diego

83
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,960
they lived kind of on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outskirts so</font>

84
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,970
you had to get a bus and then at ram

85
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,830
into the actual city where i was going

86
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,110
to for comic-con on that tram<font color="#CCCCCC"> i met so</font>

87
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,670
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> i met people who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worked for</font>

88
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,170
comic con people who'd lived in san

91
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,060
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stories that they were</font>

92
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">just bursting to tell someone it's the</font>

same in<font color="#CCCCCC"> london it's not just an american</font>

94
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,980
thing if you sit next to an old lady on

95
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,570
the bus chances are she's gonna start

96
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,130
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about her life and it's quite</font>

97
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,900
it's really great<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wish you had more of</font>

98
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,310
it but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you definitely don't</font>

99
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,470
get by driving car now this might be the

100
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">most telling factor when I was very</font>

101
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,920
little I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to always run upstairs to</font>

102
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,170
my parents rubes very kind of hysterical

103
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,940
and terrified because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought there</font>

104
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,560
was an intruder I can be quite anxious

105
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,300
sometimes and it's not a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

106
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,370
quality not having<font color="#CCCCCC"> control over all the</font>

107
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,170
other drivers on the road does make me

108
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,180
very anxious some people use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that notion</font>

109
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,680
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have control of all the</font>

110
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,180
others drivers on the road to give them

111
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,710
a sense of peace once you're able to

112
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,300
accept that you can't control<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

113
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,190
I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely healthy but I</font>

114
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,070
haven't quite got here I'm close

115
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,900
probably but<font color="#CCCCCC"> not quite there yet so I</font>

116
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,520
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I ever want to learn to</font>

117
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">drive I'd we like I said I didn't like</font>

118
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,810
getting list for my friends particularly

119
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,550
in the wee hours of the morning when

120
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,440
it's extremely cold and rather than

121
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,120
having to wait it a cold<font color="#CCCCCC"> winter's</font>

122

<font color="#CCCCCC">Bostock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would rather get a lift back</font>

123
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,810
from a friend but for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font>

124
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,430
driving doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

125
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,960
when you're traveling<font color="#E5E5E5"> and exploring a</font>

126
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,940
country public transport however limited

127
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,120
is a really fun way to travel and to get

128
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,950
to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even if no one from that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">place uses the public transport so</font>

130
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,000
there's review of my reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if i</font>

00:03:53,000 --> 00:00:00,000
rambled a bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more videos soon</font>
