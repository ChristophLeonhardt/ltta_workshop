1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,500
“The image that I want of this country
is an immigration system

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,210
that secures our borders
and upholds our humanitarian ideals.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,740
Congress needs to fix it.”

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,750
That’s Homeland Security
Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,219
She’s trying to deflect criticism
aimed at the Trump administration

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,250
for separating families who crossed
the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,590
Critics say it’s a
heartless tactic.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,660
Nielsen has tried to
argue that they’re simply

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,190
following the law.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,680
It’s not the first time that
she’s been in the cross hairs.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,360
She was close to
resigning in May

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,549
after Trump berated her
at a cabinet meeting

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,800
because he thought she
wasn’t adequately securing

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,300
the nation’s borders.

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,590
“Good afternoon.”

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,570
In a press briefing soon after,
Sarah Huckabee Sanders

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,390
was asked about
Nielsen’s rumored desire

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,055
to resign.

19
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:46,085
“Does the president have confidence
in Secretary Nielsen?”

20
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:47,850
“As we’ve said
many times before,

21
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,980
if the president no longer
has confidence in a

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,920
cabinet member, he’ll let you know.”

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,900
So how did Nielsen get here?

24
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,980
She joined the newly formed
Transportation Security Administration

25
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,110
after 9/11 and devised
national response plans

26
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,910
for things like
terrorist incidents

27
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,550
and extreme weather events.

28
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,860
Fast forward to the
Trump administration.

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,300
She worked under
John Kelly when

30
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,010
he headed homeland security.

31
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,020
And then again, when he
moved to the White House

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,090
to be chief of staff.

33
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,090
Nielsen was known was the

34
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,010
as the gatekeeper
to the gatekeeper,

35
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,920
a no-nonsense policy wonk
who helped instill discipline

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,050
in the chaotic West Wing.

37
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,700
Nielsen‘s November
confirmation hearing

38
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,790
to take over D.H.S.
was mostly deferential,

39
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,520
but there were some bumps.

40
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,030
“I believe in reuniting

41
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,540
children with their families.

42
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,689
If their families are not
here — ”

43
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:34,689
“Then are you saying you

44
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:36,480
would deport those
children to reunite them

45
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,250
with their families
who have actually

46
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,965
put those children in a
process of fleeing violence,

47
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:44,850
and they want those children
to be safe and in the United States?”

48
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,381
“Well, in that case,
I would certainly

49
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:48,060
want to work with you
to understand more

50
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,370
about the implications.”

51
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,200
“Thank you.”

52
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,350
That’s an issue she’s back 
to dealing with today,

53
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,700
though now she’s

54
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,370
less conciliatory.

55
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,670
“Here is the bottom line.

56
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,870
D.H.S. is no longer
ignoring the law.

57
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,160
We are enforcing the laws
as they exist on the books.

58
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,610
As long as illegal entry
remains a criminal offense,

59
00:02:05,610 --> 00:00:00,000
D.H.S. will not look
the other way.”
