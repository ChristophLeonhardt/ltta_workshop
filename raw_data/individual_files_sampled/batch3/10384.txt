there are plenty of excuses and embarrassment swirling among some of the world's wealthiest people and companies in the wake of the leaking of a massive trove of financial files the Paradise Papers have exposed where the richest are hiding their money and swerving around the tax system now it's millions of files and a lot of people in firmus you won't have heard of but a whole range of famous faces mentioned here's a lineup you don't normally see from the Queen of Britain and the Commonwealth through to the Queen of Pop Madonna these are implicated in the Paradise Papers big corporations feature heavily to now it's not just about the money for the mainstream media they've been scanning the files to get a political skip another member of the Trump White House is now under scrutiny for his ties to Russia there ought to be hearings and if he fails to provide a convincing and compelling explanation he ought to resign I probably won't surprise you that a lot of news outlets have been searching out some keywords among the millions of paradise papers files to link named and shamed businesses to potential Russian interference Daniel Hawkins looks at how they've been trying to put the pieces together it's one of the biggest leaks of private documents in the world revealing the financial dealings of the super wealthy and powerful from royal families to global corporations but for most media the focus has been east Putin's cronies Kremlin meddling team Trump's ties to Putin's family all the elements to grab the reader's attention so let's break it down meet Wilbur Ross US Commerce Secretary and investor now he has interests in a shipping company called navigator and one of that company's clients is Russian energy firm Seymour now two of the shareholders there are officially under US sanctions with another claim to be Putin's son-in-law and those alleged twice that the Russian president and his family could create a conflict of interest for Ross now the Commerce Secretary himself left Navigators board back in 2014 having joined two years before that he's adamant he's done nothing wrong well I think the media has made a lot more out of it than it deserves I had nothing to do with the negotiation of the deal I don't know any of those individuals never met them now it's important to note see Bohr as a company is not subject to sanctions and it's been left pretty baffled by the reaction and cyborg itself was not then sanctioned is not now sanctioned so there's nothing wrong with the fact that it happens to be called a Russian company doesn't that mean that there's any evil in it Seba expresses it surprised at the politically charged interpretation in certain media publications of regular commercial activities over many years which from the outset were reflected in the companies published accounts now if all this sounds complicated and confusing it's meant to be offshore dealings through third parties offer name to avoid regulation and taxes but that's not the main thing find a connection any connection to Russia and you have a catchy headline now if you're still with me the evidence of Russian influence goes even further from these headlines one might think the Kremlin all but owns these social media Giants but again let's take a closer look two banks controlled by the Kremlin provide the cash to third parties or investment vehicles to buy stakes in some of the world's biggest companies Russian tech investor Yuri Milner is a key link in these operations now Milner also invested in cadre that's a startup founded by Jared Kushner Donald Trump's son-in-law surely they're The Smoking Gun on Russian meddling here's what the protagonists in this conspiracy have to say themselves we announced via an August 2011 blog post that DST global led a round of investments in Twitter they have since divested their interest from Twitter in May 2014 it is worth noting that as a passive investor DST themselves had no voting rights or board seat the investment was made eight years ago and DST global has since sold all their holdings in Facebook their stake ended five years ago when we went public DST global divested its position in Facebook in twenty 13 and in Twitter in 2014 shortly after each of those companies initial public offerings and well before the 2016 US elections and if Russians apparently influence your social media do they also control your music tastes and your holiday bookings DST Global's investments in Facebook and Twitter were just two of the more than 30 internet companies around the world that DST Global's funds have invested in including Airbnb Spotify JD com zalando and Alibaba offshore financial machinations are seen by many as morally questionable at best this doesn't stop the wealthy an influential from engaging in them but money has the final say business is business unless you have any link to Russia then it's political Daniel Hogan's there how this sensational revelations made enough of a noise for the US Democrats to call for an inquiry into Wilbur Ross's business dealings British economist Keith boy field told us he believes the mainstream media would draw their own conclusions no matter what's revealed certain newspapers and media outlets are trying to blow this story out of proportion for their own ends they get very anxious about
