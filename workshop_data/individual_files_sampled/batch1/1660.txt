in Kentucky thousands of teachers stormed the State Capitol we are here today to rally for our schools the scene was much the same in Oklahoma where teachers call a recent six thousand dollar pay hike their first in a decade too little too late I'm not walking out on my children or my students I'm walking out for my students across America from West Virginia to Arizona teachers are in open revolt walking off the job demanding not only better pay and pensions but more funding for classrooms in the u.s. teacher salaries and pensions are mostly funded through a combination of state and local taxes but since the recession tighter government budgets have kept a lid on teacher wages we have our own limits and we have other people who are also in desperate need of funding when it comes to teacher salaries the u.s. is actually one of the best paying nations Luxembourg is at the top paying roughly one hundred thirteen thousand US dollars for teachers with roughly 15 years of experience Latvia is at the bottom paying only about nine thousand dollars but despite wage differences teachers worldwide have one thing in common they make on average about 20 percent less than other professions with similar training that could make teacher recruitment harder in the future we have seen reductions in the number of teachers in the number of college students who are exiting who are graduating from college with a teaching certificate and so there have been declines over the last ten years or so that people have raised warning flags about losing losing teachers to other professions teachers in Oklahoma say they'll stay off the job at least another day hoping their demands will inspire change in their state and possibly others as well Diane Estabrook al Jazeera Washington
