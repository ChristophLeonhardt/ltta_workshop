AS PART OF THE $5 MILLION
PROGRAM TO OUR MODERATE FORCES
TO FIGHT ISIS.
THE COMMANDER SAYS THEY WERE
TOLD INCONSISTENCIES AND IN
COMPETENCIES.
>> THE CONGRESSMAN TRYING TO
UNSEEDED DEMOCRATIC SEN. JUST
FAILED TO VICTORY IN THE
PENNSYLVANIA PRIMARIES.
AND SCORING THE REPUBLICAN WIN
IN THE KEY SWING STATE, WHAT
ELSE DOES THAT MEAN FOR
NOVEMBER.
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST THAT RYAN
AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST
RICHARD GOODSTEIN, THANKS FOR
COMING ON THIS MORNING.
LOU BARLETTA CLEANED HOUSE, 63%
TO 36%.
I WANT TO START WITH YOU.
THIS IS STILL A TOUGH SEAT TO
PICK UP.
>> WE ARE ALL VERY REALISTIC,
LOU BARLETTA WON LESLIE, VERY
LEGITIMATE CANDIDATE, STRONG
CANDIDATE IN THE FALL,
PENNSYLVANIA WILL BE A TOUGH
PICK UP FOR GOP IN THE SENATE.
WISCONSIN, MISSOURI AND MONTANA,
BETTER PICK UP OPPORTUNITIES
REPUBLICANS, IF HE RUNS A GREAT
RACE AND MAKES DEMOCRATS PLAY
DEFENSE IN PENNSYLVANIA, NEVER
SAY NEVER, THE FACT TRUMP WON
PENNSYLVANIA, THINGS ARE
POSSIBLE.
REPUBLICANS HAVE TO BE MORE
FOCUSED ON WEST VIRGINIA WITH
PATRICK MORRISSEY.
ROSENDAHL WILL TAKE OUT TESTER
IN MONTANA.
I AM VERY REALISTIC, LONGSHOT
PENNSYLVANIA IS A BETTER
OPPORTUNITY.
HEATHER: YOU ARE FROM
PENNSYLVANIA, YOUR TERRITORY.
IT WILL BE A TOUGH PICK UP.
BARLETTA IS AN ESTATE THE PRES.
WON.
IT WAS TIGHT BUT THE PRES. DID
WIN PENNSYLVANIA AND IS STILL
VERY POPULAR WITH A LOT OF
CORNERS.
>> HE IS NOT ALL THAT POPULAR.
THE NEXT PAUL HAD HIS
FAVORABILITY AT 39, 55 OPPOSED.
WHEN YOU ARE SEEING IN
PENNSYLVANIA A LOT OF STATES,
YOU SAW IT IN VIRGINIA IN THE
GOVERNOR'S RACE, THE BOY MORE
RACE, DESPERATE FOR A DO OVER.
DEMOCRATS NOMINATED SEVERAL
WOMEN TO RUN FOR CONGRESSIONAL
SEATS IN PENNSYLVANIA, THEY BEAT
BERNIE SANDERS ON ONE HAND AND
PEOPLE SYMPATHETIC TO DONALD
TRUMP ON THE OTHER AND UP AND
DOWN THE BALLOT THROUGHOUT THE
STATE IN PENNSYLVANIA YOU GOT
VERY FEISTY FORMER VETERANS,
HIGH-POWERED LAWYERS, RUNNING
FOR HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
DEMOCRATS NEED TO PICK UP 23,
AND CAPTURED NOMINATIONS,
DISTRICT HILLARY CLINTON WON.
DONALD TRUMP WON BY LESS THEN A
POINT BUT IS NOT VERY POPULAR.
>> THE DONNELLY SEAT IN INDIANA,
LET'S GO TO THE SECOND TOPIC,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PENDING
WAVE THAT HAS BEEN ALL THE TALK
IN NOVEMBER.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE
LEFT THAT ARE VERY ANTI-TRUMP
BUT THE MESSAGING FROM THE
DEMOCRATS HAS BEEN LACKING A LOT
OF WAYS, PEOPLE DON'T LIKE
THINGS THAT ARE NEGATIVE, I HATE
TRUMP IS NOT SOMETHING PEOPLE
VOTE FOR.
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE WILL SEE IN
NOVEMBER?
>> A COUPLE THINGS I'M WATCHING
TAKE PLACE ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE,
AND RUNNING ON SOMETHING IN 2018
AND THE MESSAGE WITH NANCY
PELOSI AS WE WILL RAISE YOUR
TAXES, DISCUSSION ABOUT
IMPEACHMENT, A REAL DRIVE IN
SOME PARTS OF THE DEMOCRAT
CAUCUS FOR IMPEACHMENT TO TAKE
THE MAJORITY BACK, WE WILL BAN
YOUR GUNS, LOOK AT THE ISSUES
DEMOCRATS ARE WANTING TO RUN ON
ARE NOT WINNING ISSUES FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MORE THAN
CONGRESSIONAL GENERIC FULL
DEMOCRATS ARE UP DOUBLE DIGITS
INTO THIS YEAR AND REUTERS A FEW
DAYS AGO UP BY ONE.
THIS IS NOT LOOKING LIKE A
MASSIVE BLUE WAVE, MORE LIKE A
BLUE TRICKLE.
IT IS DOWN TO THE QUALITY OF
CANDIDATES, HOW WELL DO THEY
RUN?
DO THEY DO THE RIGHT THINGS
PUTTING TOGETHER A GOOD CAMPAIGN
AND THE RIGHT MESSAGE BUT
DEMOCRATS PICK UP SOME SEATS BUT
NOT TAKING BACK THE HOUSE.
>> A 5% LEAD FOR DEMOCRATS IN
NOVEMBER.
A LOT OF LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC
ANALYSTS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS
WOULD BE HIGHER AT THIS POINT.
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
THE FACT IS A RECORD NUMBER OF
REPUBLICAN RETIREMENTS BECAUSE
REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES DON'T LIKE BEING
IN THE MINORITY, DOZENS OF
DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGERS OUT
RAISING REPUBLICAN INCUMBENTS.
THESE NUMBERS,
RAISING REPUBLICAN INCUMBENTS.
THESE NUMBERS, SPECIAL ELECTION
BY 21.
AND 15 OR 16 OR LESS LAST TIME,
OVER 100 AND ONLY TOOK 23 HAS TO
