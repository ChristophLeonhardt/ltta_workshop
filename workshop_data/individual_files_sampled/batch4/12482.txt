the Donald Trump organization has announced it is opening up a new Trump Tower inside the head of the editor of the New York Times a spokesman for the Trump Organization said Donald Trump already owned the real estate in the editors head and while the space was narrow there there was still plenty of room in it since there seemed to be nothing else in there besides thoughts of Donald Trump early blueprints of the tower show that the foundation will be laid in the seething froth of hysterical bias located at the base of the editors brainstem and the tower should rise unimpeded through the top of the editor's head since the top of his head exploded directly after Trump won the election Times editor blithering prevarication the third said he welcomed the construction of the new Trump Tower inside his head since it would give him a place to neatly store all the blithering prevarication Trump headlines that are now littering the front page of the former newspaper itself these headlines include some say many fields sources report experts pick Donald Trump as worst president ever celebrity stylists say Trump's hair reveals ties to fascism observers wonder why they never see Donald Trump and Steve Bannon at the same time and why stupid Americans stupidly voted for stupid Donald Trump because they're so stupid at a joint press conference mr. prevarication held with his psychiatrist the editor of the former newspaper addressed an empty room full of imaginary reporters saying quote many people say I have become obsessed with Donald Trump and that I think every news story should be about Trump and that I even think Trump is hacking my dreams and broadcasting Trump thoughts directly into my Trump head through the Trump fillings in my Trump teeth Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump unquote mr. provocation went on to assure the reporters these accusations are entirely untrue a spokesman for the Trump Organization said the new Trump Tower inside the editors head would include some never-before-seen innovations like a gigantic photograph of Donald Trump's face on every wall a recording of Trump's inaugural address playing at full volume on a loop in F and of course large gold letters spelling Trump to be used instead of furniture and fixtures the spokesman said this decor was meant to blend in with the decor that was already in the times editor's head so they would not cause much of a change to commemorate the construction of the new tower the New York Times issued a special edition with the headline Trump to build new Trump Tower Trump Trump Trump Trump the entire article consisted of Trump's name written again and again after writing the article The Times editor chased his wife through the house with an ax shouting here's Johnny before returning to live in the Trump Tower inside his head where he will continue to edit new editions of the New York Trump Trump Trump trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show

the mirror there's just like oh now I get it it's because I don't subscribe to the deli bar all right some news coming down the pike even as we go on the air Betsy DeVos was just confirmed there's Education Secretary this is excellent excellent news a couple of silly Republicans ducking out because I guess they were afraid of the teachers unions but Mike Pence broke the tie that is a first in history that a cabinet member was needed the Vice President to break the tie someone on TV last night called it very unique which you will never hear anyone in this room ever say and survived because of the unique means one of a kind so you can't be very one of a kind you can only be unique we're not unique but anyway Betsy divided these are important these are the things we talk about here Betsy deposited there was a piece I think was in The Washington Post commemorating Ronald Reagan's 106 birthday which was yesterday comparing Donald Trump to Ronald Reagan which normally would not be even interesting except for the brilliant guy who was writing the article and for the fact that he has been right about everything so we're gonna get to that later on in the show first let's just cover some of the news of course Trump's order to temporarily ban refugees and to ban people coming in from seven countries that the Obama administration deemed as dangerous so they can check on their vetting procedures that has been suspended by a Seattle Judge James Robart because he said kind of ridiculously he said that it was bound to be overturned so I'm suspending it which is he's actually allowed to do that like if he thinks is a likely case that who will be suspended but why he thinks that nobody knows and whether he actually whether a Seattle judge actually has the right to do that I'm not sure Donald Trump of course responded with the tweet calling him a so-called judge and the hearts of the medias broke in Twain for the feelings of this judge you got to watch this this is an incredible George snuffleupagus former Democrat hack currently a Democrat hack portraying a journalist on TV set it says to Mike Pence like aren't you aren't you concerned listen to the the lovelorn voice of this guy is it right for the president to say so-called judge doesn't that undermine the separation of powers in the Constitution written right next door well I don't think it does I think the American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind and speaking very straight with him and it's very frustrating when when scholars on the left and the right people as distinguished as Jonathan Turley of George Washington University have said while he doesn't agree with the executive order he recognizes the president has the full authority to put the security of the homeland first in determining who comes in to judge actually suspend that order across the country this is a judge who is nominated by President Bush 99 to nothing confirmed how is he a so-called judge well again there's there's simply no question under the Constitution and frankly under federal law that the President of the United States has the authority in the interest of national security to determine who has the right to come into this country really like Mike Pence and Shawn Spencer if the hardest jobs in the country right now is liking the Trump whispers or the guys who tell you what Trump really meant when you say something but I just love I love the bleeding sadness of George snuffleupagus as he like says Oh like you know isn't it what about the separation of powers I mean it does my heart good to see left-wing hacks suddenly worried about the separation of powers where were they for eight years they didn't but it's great I mean it's terrific we should we should have had Trump in there a long time ago here's Andrew Napolitano the legal authority at Fox News good guy talking about just the fact that does absolutely have the right to do what he did whether you think this is wise or not whether you think it's disruptive or not whether you think it's fair to stop everybody including people with hardship cases in order to keep a few bit people out that is a decision for the President of the United States and the President of the United States only the statues job correct the statute couldn't be clearer it's a 1952 statute that expressly says the President of the United States on his own may suspend the immigration of any person class or group of people for public health public safety or national security and so you know I just want to remind that you know the thing is we have to find we have to find our way here because it's so frustrating and so frustrating the level of the sterian I'm gonna get back to that in a minute that level of a stereo with which he's being Trump is being covered that there is this tendency to say well you never did this with Obama you never did this with Obama without judging Trump on its own what he says on its own merits I mean here it let's just to remind you here is Obama at the State of the Union hurling what is an absolute untruth into the faces of the Supreme Court they had just done this the you know the case that oh my gosh I forgot that the one that Hillary Clinton was always yelling about where they said that a corporation retains its rights to free speech and this drove this drove the left crazy and they've been trying to destroy it ever since and he hurls it back they're sitting there and he hurls it back in their face now listen to this with all due deference to separation of powers last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests including foreign corporations to spend without limit in our elections so so you can see Alito sitting there shaking his head glue what the hell is he talking about I just reverse any law I mean they basically just said as I've explained to I've explained this to left-wingers again and again all they said was that if you form a corporation you don't lose your rights to free speech so you know this that clear clear attempt to intimidate the Supreme Court from the bully pulpit of the presidency when virtually without notice in the mainstream media you didn't see snuffleupagus crying then I mean that's only now that the guy is suddenly oh my goodness oh my goodness he called him a so-called judge you know I mean if you think if you think that Trump has not made the left hysterical I've got it I've got a couple of cuts to play that are just hilarious I mean what is happening now is that demonstrators have gathered outside Chuck Schumer's house right top Democrat in the Senate they've gathered outside his house and they're screaming you know do resistance resistance again and they have these four-letter words and all this stuff so these guys are waking up every day looking out their window and seeing these people who are telling them you know you have to resist everything Donald Trump does and meanwhile there are Republicans who now have to go out in the next midterm election and have to go out to these Republican states that voted for Trump by well over 55% and run for office so if they if there's nothing but hysterical hysterical resistance you know they're gonna lose they're they're gonna lose their seats if you don't think that Donald Trump has built his latest Trump Tower inside the Democrats head listen to Nancy Pelosi talk about the fact that she can't support anything he does listen carefully to what she says while it's only a couple of weeks since the inauguration there's complete evidence there's practice we've seen nothing that we can work but I can work with President Bush on and I'm disappointed because I thought that there might be some interest because of what he said in the campaign which turns out to be not true a hoax and really dangerous to the economic stability of America's working families President Bush President Bush hello granny I think what administration they are so is there she can't even remember the name of the president you can see Maxine Waters standing in back but give this look through the guy I think that's not this president any or is it is that the still the president I'm not sure it's just completely hysterical and it is right here this is my favorite this is my favorite here is Katie tor now we're gonna get back to this idea of of the Russians and all this stuff but Katie tor reacts to on she's on MSNBC and this is her reaction to Trump's statement that you know O'Reilly asked him if he respected Putin Putin's a killer Trump says oh well we have plenty of killers too and here's Katie tor interviewing a senator and listen to the question she asked senator the junior senator in your state senator Ben Sasse came out pretty strongly over the weekend condemning Donald Trump's assertion that we are just as bad as Russia when he said that you know America does bad and terrible things too when Bill O'Reilly asked him if Vladimir Putin was a killer why what is your sense of why this president is going above and beyond bending over backwards if you will to stay away from criticizing the Russian president and it's almost give him an excuse as we know there's since 2000 been a couple dozen suspicious deaths of journalists in Russia who came out against the government there Donald Trump has made no secret about going after journalists and then his distaste for any news that doesn't agree with him here do you find that this is a dangerous path he is heading down is now assassinating journalists there I mean the journalists they're running covers in Europe of trumpet with a you know target on his head and running actual articles saying should we what do you think should let's discuss should we do assassinate him but she's afraid the Trump is gonna assassinate that he doesn't have to assassinate him they're shooting themselves in the foot every single day and not only are they shooting themselves in the foot their foot is in their mouth so it's really dangerous it is just absolutely amazing this the level of hysteria they have reached and I just want to play before we we're gonna have to cut away from Facebook but before we do I just want to play this very funny imitation of Sean Spicer the spokesman Melissa McCarthy on Saturday Night Live and the reason I want to play it is this is what the media are seen this is what I mean this is what they see is happening to them here is Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer so this is what they hear you know they're like we were just sitting here trying to destroy your administration and now everybody's picking on us what's going on here 7% the last number I heard 7% of American journalists or Republicans 7% and still when you ask them if they're biased or like biased what bias they're tweeting how do we bring this man down how do we destroy this administration and then they go on the air we go you know our objective report here we you know and they think they think they're not bias all right we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but come on over to the Daily wire calm you can hear the rest if you subscribe you can watch the rest and you can get your question in the mailbag and turn your miserable existence for a up to come on over
