1
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,950
I’ll visualize a run the way
that I want to see it done.

2
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,940
I usually do this off to the side
away from everybody, sort of

3
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,200
in my own quiet space.

4
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:24,340
When you’re in the
gate, and you’re

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,990
standing there
getting ready to drop,

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,530
it is the most present,
hyper-focused moment

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,990
of my entire life.

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,520
I’ve just buckled
my snowboard on.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,885
I can feel the pressure of

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,720
my straps on my ankles.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,520
Is it snowing, or is it sunny?

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,239
Is there wind on my face?

13
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:42,280
I reach over to the gate.

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,660
I make sure the handles are
adjusted to the right height.

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,760
I’m looking at the
top of the start gate,

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,930
just waiting for it to move.

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,260
Trying to feel what
that adrenaline’s like.

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,560
The gate opens.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,270
I can hear it.

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,460
It makes an audible click.

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,962
I imagine the
exhale of my breath,

22
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:05,420
because you’re
holding your breath.

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,929
And when you pull, you’re
pulling as hard as you can

24
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:09,470
and trying to generate
as much speed.

25
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,430
And so it’s like this
exhale and react.

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,180
I have to move really quickly
over the first two features.

27
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,350
It’s real target shoot.

28
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,420
You really have to barely
pick your feet up and over.

29
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,120
Can hear the wind going
through my goggles,

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,250
and I can sort of
feel it on my eyes.

31
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,675
Going probably 40 miles
an hour through there.

32
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:32,150
I’m jockeying for position,
making sure that my body

33
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,110
position’s really good.

34
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,070
I know people are going to
be trying to crowd my space.

35
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,240
If you’re driving a car, and you
have a five-lane road and six

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,729
cars, and you’re all trying
to fight to go the fastest,

37
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,020
you’re going to hit each other.

38
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,250
You’re going to bump
against each other.

39
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,570
You’re going to trade paint.

40
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,470
Rubbing is racing.

41
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,320
Being close to each
other, that’s the chaos.

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,300
If you slip up in
the first corner,

43
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,750
your day could be done just
first round, first run.

44
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,020
I always imagine taking a
pretty big deep breath at about

45
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,000
halfway through the course.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,620
A lot of times you
can hear an edge

47
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,689
running through the
snow or somebody coming

48
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:06,370
up short on a jump.

49
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,956
My heart rate’s going
through my roof.

50
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:09,580
If there’s a competitor
in front of me,

51
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,070
I’m staying right on their
tail and breaking off

52
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,514
to the left just
at the last second

53
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:16,180
before I go through
the last two rollers

54
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,686
and across the finish line.

55
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,060
Even when I’m just
visualizing it

56
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,726
right now, when I
cross the finish line,

57
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:22,540
it’s this huge relief.

58
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,190
It’s like, O.K., I
made it down safe.

59
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,320
I’m going on to the next round.

60
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,420
Let’s do this again.

61
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,570
I’m not out there knitting
sweaters, you know?

62
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,710
I’m racing boardercross
because it makes me feel alive

63
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,490
and because I love it.

64
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,890
It’s gnarly.

65
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,037
Goddamn, it’s
probably — yeah, it’s

66
00:02:39,037 --> 00:02:40,870
the best drug you’re
going to be able to do.

67
00:02:40,870 --> 00:00:00,000
So, it’s good.
