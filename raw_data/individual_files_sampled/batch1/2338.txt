mr. president your FBI nominee said if someone in a campaign got an email about Russia like the one that your son Don jr. received that they should alert the FBI rather than accept that meeting is he wrong as far as my son is concerned my son is a wonderful young man he took a meeting with a Russian lawyer not a government lawyer but a Russian lawyer it was a short meeting it was a meeting that went very very quickly very fast to other people in the room they I guess one of them left almost immediately and the other one was not really focused in the meeting I do think this I think from a practical standpoint most people would have taken that meeting it's called opposition research or even research into your opponent I've had many people I have only been in politics for two years but I've had many people call up oh gee we have information on this factor or this person or frankly Hillary that's very standard in politics politics is not the nicest business in the world but it's very standard where they have information and you take the information I have a son who's a great young man he's a fine person stick a meeting with a lawyer from Russia it lasted for a very short period and nothing came of the meeting and I think it's a meeting that most people in politics probably would have taken
