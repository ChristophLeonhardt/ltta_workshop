from prison off war to presidential candidate in 2008 John McCain mounted a challenge against Barack Obama but lost in a landslide my friends we have we have come to the end of a long journey the American people have spoken and they have spoken clearly he returned to the Senate where he'd served a senator for Arizona more than 30 years this in the Trump election a man with whom McCain had a prickly relationship in the past which did not improve Senator McCain emerged as a conscience of the Republican Party in pushing back against several actions of a president who was the party's new voice on the Trump travel ban I think the effect will probably in some areas give Isis some more propaganda we don't want fake news on threats against the media when you look at history the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press and I'm not saying that that's that that President Trump is trying to be a dictator I'm just saying we need to learn the lessons of history on the likely reaction of past leaders to claims of alternative facts they would be alarmed by the growing inability and even unwillingness to separate truth from lies Senator McCain served in the Vietnam War his aircraft shot down over Hanoi he broke his leg and arms suffered torture and spent more than five years as a prisoner of war before returning to the US as a war hero a description he humorously undercut during this visit to the Libyan city of Benghazi in 2011 they also served in the United States Navy for many years I was a pilot but had a very good plan that I was shut down diagnosed with cancer and recovering from head surgery John McCain received a standing ovation when he returned to the hill for a crucial Senate vote and the motion is agreed to he followed the Republican line in voting to open a debate on repealing the Affordable Care Act but in his speech was deeply critical of a Senate that he described as or partisan and more tribal than ever before let's trust each other let's return to regular order we've been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle and a few days later in the early hours of the morning John McCain put principle before party defying immense Republican pressure to support a bill repealing Barack Obama's health legislation he's back and in that moment he rose above the Senate mired in endless squabble offering the hope that governance by consensus rather than by command could still be possible at times John McCain could be wrong but on this dramatic night he demonstrated truth to himself and to the country he devoted his life to serving
