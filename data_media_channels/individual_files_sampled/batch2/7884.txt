lawmakers are planning on focusing specifically on tax overhaul or tax reform and Republicans in Congress realize that in order to be successful they probably have to appeal to some Democrats so there is a strategy in place and if you are angry at establishment Democrats this story will probably infuriate you even more now White House officials have been wooing 15 to 20 centrist House Democrats since early summer that's according to reporting by Politico and they have some specific names that I will share with you in just a minute now keep in mind that at a mid-june dinner at the White House with four centrist House Democrats President Donald Trump expressed interest in a bipartisan package combining tax reform with infrastructure spending and that's according to multiple sources that spoke to Politico and so there are two organizations that Republican lawmakers and White House officials are specifically focusing on it's the Blue Dog Coalition these are the centrist Democrats Blue Dog Democrats and also the problem-solvers caucus which also consists of individuals who don't really solve problems again their centrist Democrats now mark short who is the White House director of legislative affairs says we prefer bipartisan support for the tax plan we still think we can earn the support of Democrats on the tax package now keep in mind look I'm not I'm not against working together you know negotiating debating figuring out which policies make the most sense for the American people but these are specifically Democrats who are in favor of further tax cuts for the top one percent and so that's the issue here right and and Republicans know hey we didn't have much success when it came to repealing the Affordable Care Act because we didn't get any of the Democrats on board but when it comes to wealthy donors well we can probably get some Democrats to work with us on tax breaks for the wealthy so look are we against working together no of course it depends on the issues so for example if you're talking about infrastructure spending and I thought that it was a smart populist idea by Steve been talked about spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure and it's not just a smart political idea it's a great idea in reality because it would create jobs and it would give us better infrastructure and and and it would stimulate the economy etc but and here comes some huge butts you dive into the plan of infrastructure spending that the Trump administration is proposing and you go out there privatizing the roads it's not just it's not we're not paying in taxes and then we get better rose by pew that which is good that's what taxes should go to better roads better bridges make sure they don't fall down plus it creates jobs no no it gets privately financed and then we have to pay tolls on those roads forever and they're going to make a profit off of that so if you say all I don't want more taxes to make sure the bridges don't fall down well you're gonna tech get text more because they got to make a profit on top that's right so no I don't agree to that plan and I and so that's a terrible plan the devil in this case maybe literally is in the details now that's the better side of the plan the hideous side of the plan is giant tax giveaways for the rich and for corporations they call it tax reform that is a lie so let me break down three different things that words that are used here that are not true tax reform would entail potentially raising taxes reform doesn't mean cutting or raising theoretically that word doesn't mean it right is there any chance that Donald Trump when the Republicans are going to raise taxes on the rich and corporations no there is a zero percent chance so it is not tax reform and by the way journalists be honest about what it is don't listen to their propaganda it's tax cuts and you know it and by the way the Republicans have now publicly said that it is not going to be revenue neutral so there's no excuse left it's tax cuts call it by its name saying of all the problem solver caucus the only eight problems that they solve is for their own donors so then I try to solve problems for the middle class how does a yet another tax cut for rich and and for multinational corporations help anybody in the country I know go down nonsense we've been doing that for 40 years and it's destroyed our wages okay and then certainly they are not centrist Democrats they might be centrist in Washington where the spectrum is insanely right-wing but I don't say this because I'm a progressive and I don't say it from my gut I say based on polling 63% of Americans want to raise taxes on the rich 67% of Americans want to raise taxes on corporations they don't want to cut them if you hear that in Washington you're hearing propaganda that is paid for lies so by the way if you're a so-called reporter and you're talking about what the American people want or Joaquin said this centrist Democrat said that who gives a damn what they said what's the reality and the reality is Americans don't want this they want the opposite and those Blue Dog Democrats are gonna go and serve up these tax cuts for their their donor friends so let's give names let's name names representative Josh got heimer Democrat of New Jersey in New Jersey he should be fired immediately by his voters they should write him out of town but you're gonna give more tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America you're gonna do a pull of chris Christie in New Jersey he should be primary and ridden out of town okay representative Curt straighter Democratic of Oregon's so-called Democrat of Oregon in Oregon he said the following he says the door is open and this should be a bipartisan issue I hope they consider us oh look at this my god in Oregon you got a guy who's going as a Democrat I hope Trump considers us oh please get serious I want to come tax my daughters do please please get serious get the you got to get him out get him out get him out get him out well look I think this past election should have been a wake-up call for Democrats in office period regardless of whether or not they identify a centrist or liberal Democrats the reality is working-class Americans feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and now they feel like they're better represented by Republicans that should tell you something right and look the only reason why they like they're better represented by Republicans is because you had someone like Donald Trump pretending like he cared about the economic issues that a lot of working-class Americans are dealing with right now he's seriously one person outside of Bernie Sanders I'm just talking about the general election only one person and that was Donald Trump who focused on the issue of jobs bringing them back to the to the United States wages things like that I mean was he actually being genuine or sincere does he actually care about those issues no he's already proven that he doesn't care about it but again Democrats don't focus on that enough and their actions go completely against what they claim they want to do which is take care of the the working class in the middle class so look Trump was lied about it but at least he was savvy enough to lie he said not only that he was gonna do infrastructure and create jobs hey Democrats why don't you try that you idiots you're supposed to be the party of creating jobs why don't you say hey we're gonna do infrastructure we're not gonna privatize your roads we're not gonna make you pay tolls for the rest of your life we're actually going to do the thing that he promised in the campaign but we're actually secondly he said he would raise taxes on the rich we forget that he said he was gonna take away that loophole that hedge funds and private equity had another grotesque lie but at least he was smart enough to lie about it and Democrats are like oh no we got to protect our boys on Wall Street oh yeah you know what more money in politics is fantastic and how could you say we did something for Wall Street what this is what you're doing and Blue Dog Democrats you told us it was the practical thing to do hey you had about four dozen Blue Dog Democrats in the house you know what happened they all started to loose and now you're down there like what eighteen members how'd you lose 30 members you know how you lost them because you don't win elections people hate you they don't like wouldn't you represent your donors they don't like that you represent the financial industry they don't like you what part of this don't you understand it's not practical to sell out to your donors it isn't practical it's a losing terrible strategy and I do want to read a quote from one of these Democrats representative dan Lipinski from Illinois he says centrist Democrats are more focused on doing what can be done to lower the corporate rates and the rates for small business small business Gallup is you gotta go he's in Illinois gotta go gotta go yeah look man just Democrats are trying to run against these guys nah it's not personal I don't know lepenski I don't know these guys I don't want to know them right I just want them out of office because they're doing great damage yes to the Democratic Party but much more importantly to progressive ideology and to the country you gotta get them out look I don't even know to be honest there's ten guys running ten people running for it's just Democrats it's not enough we got to get more money otherwise these we should primary every one of these guys and if we don't do what somebody else should do it because you have Democrats begging to work with Trump to cut taxes which is against two-thirds of not Democrats of the entire country's wishes so whether it's just as Democrats are calm slash win by god help there but any organization our revolution anything to get these guys out because it is not practical all it does is lead to disastrous results and this is what got Trump elected in the first place helped us build an independent media together come join us TYT Network comm slash join
