Laura: THE MAN WHO IS REALLY LEAD AND GALVANIZE THE G.O.P.'S EFFORTS TO RALLY BEHIND JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S LINDSEY GRAHAM. ONE WEEK AFTER HIS FIERY CALL TO ARMS, I LOVED IT! THE SENATOR IS FEELING MORE CONFIDENT THAN AFTER AFTER READING THE FBI REPORT ON BRETT KAVANAUGH. SENATOR GRAHAM JOINS US HOW TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND WHAT IS NEXT, SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WHAT OTHER GAMES CAN WE EXPECT FROM THE DEMOCRATS BEFORE THIS THING GOES TO THE FINAL VOTE? THEY WILL DO IT. IF THEY COULD WRITE A BOOK ABOUT OVERPLAYING THEIR HANDS IN POLITICS, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST CHAPTER. THE FBI REPORTS, THE BACKGROUND INTERVIEWED NINE PEOPLE. THEY FOLLOW THE DIRECTION OF THE THREE SENATORS WHO ASKED FOR MORE INVESTIGATION. IT CAME BACK VERY GOOD FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND NOW I WOULD EXPECT HE SENATORS TO VOTE YES. I HOPE THEY WILL BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY ASKED FOR. Laura: THE COMPLAINT FROM THE LEFT. THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM. WE HAVE A FEW SENATORS, A FEW OF YOUR FRIENDS AND OTHERS WHO COMMENTED TODAY. LET'S WATCH. IT IS OBVIOUSLY A COVER-UP. THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE WORKING WITH THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE SENATE HAVE DELIBERATELY CIRCUMSCRIBED THIS INVESTIGATION. THEY'RE MAKING A MOCKERY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLIMATE. SPEAK UP THAT IS NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION IT IS A INVESTIGATION. Laura: THEY DIDN'T INTERVIEW HER COUSIN SECOND TWICE REMOVED. THIS IS YOUR VIEW OF THE SENATE'S ROLE IS TO TAKE A GOOD MAN'S LIFE AND TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN, BETRAY DR. FORD'S TRUST. DO EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD TO DESTROY HIM. THAT DOES NOT ADVISE CONSENTS THAT IS DESPICABLE. IT IS GOING TO BLOW UP IN YOUR FACE. I HOPE IT DOES BECAUSE IF IT GOES WRONG HE WILL GET ON THE COURT. THEY HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT THE FBI SUPPLEMENTED INVESTIGATION WAS ABOUT. THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO VOTE NO BEFORE ANYONE SAID NO. HEAR WHAT THEY ASKED FOR, THEY ASKED THAT THE PEOPLE WHO NAMED HER GOT INTERVIEWED AND MISS RAMIREZ BE INTERVIEWED. THAT WAS DONE PLUS FOUR, FIVE OTHER WITNESSES. THE RESULTS ARE IN. SENATOR COLLINS AND SENATOR FLAKE BUT IT WAS THOROUGH. THE THOUGHT IT WAS FAIR. THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE MY FRIENDS AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY TALK ABOUT. Laura: SENATOR SCHUMER TALKED ABOUT THE EMOTION THAT DROVE CHRISTINE FORD IN THE COUNTRY RALLYING BEHIND HER, IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS TAKEN THIS IN A MIDTERM POSE. LET'S WATCH. DR. FORD CAME FORWARD AND ONE AMERICA'S HEARTS. A REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WERE UPSET THAT THAT MIGHT DERAIL THEIR HEADLONG RUSH TO PUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH ON THE SUPREME COURT. Laura: THE HEADLONG RUSH? YOU'RE RUSHING THIS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO GET IT DONE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. THIS WAS EMOTIONALLY BASED AND USED BY THOSE PROTESTERS TODAY ON CAPITOL HILL, A LOT OF WOMEN. THEY TOOK OVER THE OFFICE BUILDING FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG. THEY PROMISE THAT THEY WERE GONNA KEEP DOING THIS. THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP TACKLING YOU GUYS IN ELEVATORS AND QUARTERING YOU IN THE HALLS. THE PROTEST CULTURE IS GOING TO CONTINUE. IT WON'T WORK FOR ME. I THINK MY COLLEAGUES FEEL OFFENDED AS DOES SENATOR SCHUMER. I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE DISAPPOINTED IN YOU AND YOUR PARTY. SHE REQUESTED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS, IT WAS SOMEBODY ON YOUR SIDE WHO LEAKED IT TO THE PRESS FOR POLITICAL PURPOSE. HER OWN LAWYERS WHO WERE ADVISED TO BE APPOINTED BY SENATOR FEINSTEIN, THE MOST CLINICALLY ACTIVE PERSON APPARENTLY NEVER TOLD DR. FORD THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CALIFORNIA TO AVOID ANY EMBARRASSMENT. PLEASE DON'T USE AND ABUSE HIS WOMAN ANYMORE. HER ACCUSATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN COOPERATED. WE DON'T KNOW ANYMORE THAN WE DID BEFORE. THE PEOPLE SHE NAMED, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT. IT REALLY OFFENDS ME THAT SENATOR SCHUMER WOULD CONTINUE TO ABUSE DR. FORD. THEY ARE THE ONES WERE PLAYING POLITICS. I VOTED, NEVER THOUGHT TWICE ABOUT IT. I TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, THIS IS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR THE 2018 ELECTION. THIS IS UNFAIR. Laura: LET'S TALK ABOUT REPERCUSSIONS FOR WHAT HAPPENS. HE DID THE FILING OF FALSE EVIDENCE, THAT CAN BE PROVED. WHAT ABOUT TO THIS LEAKING ISSUE, WE TALK ABOUT ON THE SHO SHOW. IT SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE IS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH HERE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THE SENATE'S SIDE. DO YOU THINK WHAT DIANE FEINSTEIN SAID WHEN SHE SAID, I DIDN'T ASK ANYBODY AND THEN SHE SAID, OH, NO, THEY TELL ME I DID ASK THEM. NO ONE ON MY STAFF LEAKS IT. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? I BELIEVE THAT SHE DIDN'T ONLY GET BETTER KNOW ABOUT HER STAFF. I DO KNOW THIS, OR STAFF RECOMMENDED TO DR. FORD WHO HATES TRUMP AND IS A POLITICALLY ACTIVIST LAWYER, APPARENTLY DR. FORD WAS NOT TOLD BY HER LEGAL TEAM. SOMEBODY ON THEIR SIDE LEAKED ANONYMOUS LETTER WITHOUT Laura: SO ARE NOT SECURE THE EMAILS ON THEIR TAX? HERE IS WHAT I'M GONNA DO. ANYBODY WHO DID THIS IS GOING TO PAY A PRICE. THE PEOPLE WHO EXPOSED MY NAME, SENATOR HATCH. THAT PERSON IS GOING TO PAY A PRICE. MY GOAL IF I AM CHAIRMAN IS TO MAKE SURE NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN IS TO PUNISH THOSE WHO DID IT. Laura: WHAT LESSON YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD TAKE OUT OF ALL THIS? THIS WAS A MOMENT, THE PARTY GOT UNIFIED. THE ECONOMY IS ON FIRE. GREAT JUDGES. NAFTA WAS RENEGOTIATED. WHAT IS NEXT? THE PRESIDENT SHOULD TAKE THE FOLLOWING, IF YOU APPOINT A GOOD PERSON WHO GETS DESTROYED IN A DESPICABLE MANNER AND YOU FIGHT FOR HIM, PEOPLE WILL LIKE YOU MORE. WHETHER YOU ARE TRUMP REPUBLICAN OR BUSH REPUBLICAN, LIBERTARIAN OR VEGETARIAN REPUBLICAN. WE ARE ALL TOGETHER NOW THANKS TO THIS DESPICABLE ATTACK ON A GOOD MAN. HERE'S WHAT I WANT THE PRESIDENT TO KNOW. DO THE RIGHT THING AND FIGHT FOR IT AND YOU WILL GET REWARDED. CAVANAGH WILL BE ON THE BENCH. THOSE WHO TRY TO DESTROY HIM ARE GOING TO BE LOOKED AT AND THEY ARE GOING TO PAY A PRICE. I THINK THIS IS GOING TO HELP US IN THE MIDTERMS. I HATE THAT THIS IS WHAT IT TOOK TO HELP REPUBLICANS. TO THE OTHER SIDE, YOU MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE. TO TO THE THREE REPUBLICANS, YO TO TO THE THREE REPUBLICANS, YU WERE ALL FRIENDS OF MINE, PLEASE BE GUESSED NOW. EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM, JUDGE KAVANAUGH HE IS A GOOD MAN. SEVEN FBI INVESTIGATIONS. HUNDRED AND 56 PEOPLE. ALL OF THE STUFF IS GARBAGE. Laura: YOUR MANAGER BACK IN 1998, I REMEMBER IT WELL, DEMOCRATS ARE PLEDGING THAT IF THEY TAKE THE HOUSE THEY COULD VERY WELL MOVE TO IMPEACH BRETT KAVANAUGH. GETTING HIM CONVICTED WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DO, DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN IF REPUBLICANS LOSE THE HOUSE AND KEEP THIS SAGA GOING? I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY RATIONALITY, HATRED IS THERE ONLY PLATFORM. IT IS NOT ABOUT WHO THEY LIKE IT IS ABOUT WHO THEY HATE. THE THOUGHT THAT YOU ARE GUILTY JUST BY THE ACCUSATION. IF A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WERE TREATED BY THE REPUBLICANS AS BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS TREATED BY THE DEMOCRATS, EVERYONE BE UP IN ARMS. JOE MANCHIN, WILL HE VOTE YES? IF YOU LISTENS TO THE PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA HE WILL. BRETT DESERVES YOUR VOTE JOE. HE IS MY FRIEND, I'VE KNOWN HIM
