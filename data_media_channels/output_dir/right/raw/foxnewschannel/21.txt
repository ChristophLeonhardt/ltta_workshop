00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:13,730

GREAT TO HAVE ALL OF YOU WITH

00:00:29,647 --> 00:00:30,113
US.

21
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:31,848
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.

22
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:33,550
PICKLE THANKS FOR US ON.

23
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:34,551
>> Shannon: I HAVE BEEN

24
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:36,519
FOLLOWING YOUR CASE FOR YEARS AS

25
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,489
THIS IS BEEN GOING ON.

26
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,557
WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET INTO

27
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:42,292
ALL THE TWISTS AND TURNS BUT YOU

28
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,493
DID LOSE YOUR BUSINESS.

29
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:44,294
YOU'VE GOT A BIG FAMILY.

30
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:49,065
HOW ARE YOU ALL FARING NOW?

31
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:53,436
>> AARON IS WORKING AT A JOB.

32
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:55,405
HE'S PAYING THE BILLS.

33
00:00:55,406 --> 00:00:56,873
>> Shannon: YOU GUYS ARE

34
00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:57,674
SURVIVING.

35
00:00:57,675 --> 00:00:58,408
DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD MAKE IT

36
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:00,143
TO THE SUPREME COURT?

37
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,211
NOW THE JUSTICES WILL HAVE TO

38
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:02,579
VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO CAKE T

39
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:02,612
VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO CAKE K

40
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:04,481
VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO CAKE E

41
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:05,148
YOUR CASE BUT IT'S POSSIBLE

42
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,349
THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL END UP.

43
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,484
>> WE REALLY HOPE SO.

44
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:09,586
>> WE ARE HOPING THEY WILL TAKE

45
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:10,053
THE CASE.

46
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:10,887
>> Shannon: YOU ARE LEADING

47
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:11,288
THE EFFORT.

48
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:12,122
I WANT TO READ SOMETHING THAT

49
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:17,127
YOU PUT IN THE PETITION.

50
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:17,727
YOU SAID THEY SERVED ALL

51
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:18,328
CUSTOMERS REGARDLESS OF

52
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:19,462
ORIENTATION, THIS WAS AN

53
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:21,231
EXPRESSION OF THEIR FAITH, WHICH

54
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:21,898
TEACHES THAT ALL PERSONS ARE

55
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:24,601
MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD AND ARE

56
00:01:24,602 --> 00:01:25,335
THEREFORE DESERVING OF DIGNITY.

57
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,670
WE KNOW THE CLIENTS HAVE SERVED

58
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,071
THIS COUPLE BEFORE, BUT IT

59
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:29,306
WASN'T UNTIL THEY CAME FOR A

60
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:31,274
CUSTOM WEDDING CAKE THAT THE

61
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:32,709
RELIGIOUS ISSUE CAME TO THE

62
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,277
FOREFRONT AND I KNOW THAT YOU

63
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:35,812
WERE REALLY HAMMERING ON FREE

64
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:36,613
SPEECH ISSUES AS WELL AND HOPING

65
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:38,982
TO GET THE COURTS TO TAKE THIS

66
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:39,883
CASE.

67
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:40,317
>> ABSOLUTELY.

68
00:01:40,318 --> 00:01:42,052
THIS SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO ANY

69
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:42,852
AMERICAN.

70
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,789
THEY'VE BEEN FINED $135,000, HAD

71
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,623
THEIR BUSINESS CLOSED.

72
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:48,091
IF THERE ACTUALLY WAS A GAG

73
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:49,726
ORDER TELLING THEM NOT TO SPEAK

74
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:51,861
PUBLICLY THEIR BELIEFS ABOUT

75
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:52,862
MARRIAGE.

76
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,131
AND THIS IS A GREAT CASE FOR THE

77
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:56,566
COURT TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE

78
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:57,300
AND REALLY DISPOSE OF IT FOR THE

79
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:58,902
WHOLE COUNTRY.

80
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:01,237
THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER WE HAVE

81
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:02,472
FREE SPEECH OR WHETHER THE

82
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:03,640
GOVERNMENT CAN COME TO PEOPLE

83
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:04,941
AND SAY YOU WILL SPEAK OUR

84
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:06,643
MESSAGE THAT WE WANT YOU TO

85
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:09,179
SPEAK OR WE WILL SHUT DOWN YOUR

86
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,879
BUSINESS.

87
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,315
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER SET OF

88
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,049
FACTS WITH WHAT'S HAPPENED TO

89
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,252
MELISSA AND AARON AND I WANT

90
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:17,454
PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING US TO

91
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:19,222
REALIZE THIS IS NOT JUST MELISSA

92
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:19,622
AND AARON.

93
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:20,724
IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO THIS TO

94
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,692
THEM, THEY CAN DO THIS TO YOU.

95
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:25,695
I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO

96
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:27,063
REALLY BE PRAYING FOR AARON AND

97
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:27,397
MELISSA.

98
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,666
GO TO FirstLiberty.org.

99
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,468
YOU CAN PRAY FOR THEM, YOU CAN

100
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:32,102
FOLLOW THEIR CASE.

101
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:33,169
BUT THIS IS A GREAT CASE FOR THE

102
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,604
COURT TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE

103
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:36,740
AND HOPEFULLY PROTECT ALL

104
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:37,307
AMERICANS.

105
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:38,008
>> Shannon: WE KNOW THE LAST

106
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:41,811
BIG CASE BEFORE JUSTICE KENNEDY

107
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:42,912
ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT REALLY

108
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:43,646
DIDN'T RESOLVE THE QUESTION BUT

109
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:44,447
YOU KNOW FOLKS ON THE LEFT AND I

110
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:46,716
GOT A STACK OF QUOTES AND

111
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:47,684
ARTICLES FOR PEOPLE WHO SAY WHAT

112
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,219
YOU ARE ASKING FOR IS A LICENSE

113
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,153
FOR PEOPLE TO DISCRIMINATE BY

114
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:53,656
USING THEIR RELIGION.

115
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:54,457
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

116
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,292
AS YOU MENTIONED, THEY SERVE AT

117
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:56,659
EVERYBODY.

118
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,727
THEY SERVED THIS COUPLE.

119
00:02:57,728 --> 00:03:00,463
IT'S ONLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE BEING

120
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:01,097
ASKED OR FORCED BY THE

121
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,866
GOVERNMENT TO EXPRESS A MESSAGE

122
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:04,901
THAT THEY CAN'T IN THEIR OWN

123
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:05,635
CONSCIENCE EXPRESS THAT THERE'S

124
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:06,936
A CONFLICT.

125
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,072
AND WE'VE ALREADY BELIEVED THAT

126
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:10,006
THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T FORCE

127
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:11,474
PEOPLE TO SAY THINGS THEY DON'T

128
00:03:11,475 --> 00:03:11,908
BELIEVE.

129
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,309
IF WE EVER GIVE THE GOVERNMENT

130
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,611
THAT POWER, GOD FORBID WHAT

131
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:16,079
HAPPENS TO OUR FREEDOMS IN THIS

132
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,913
COUNTRIES.

133
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:17,781
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CASE

134
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:19,549
FOR EVERY AMERICAN.

135
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,085
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT BELIEFS ON

136
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:22,786
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BUT I THINK

137
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,288
WHAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS

138
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,490
PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE

139
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,224
DIFFERENT BELIEFS ON SAME-SEX

140
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:28,892
MARRIAGE.

141
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:29,659
>> Shannon: WOULD YOU DO THIS

142
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,393
AGAIN HAD YOU KNOW WHERE THIS

143
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:33,296
WOULD TAKE YOU?

144
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,264
>> AGAIN, THIS IS NOTHING WE

145
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:35,565
WOULD EVER WANT TO HURT ANYBODY

146
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:36,132
WITH.

147
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,300
WE NEVER WANTED TO BE IN THIS

148
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,401
SITUATION BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT

149
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:40,270
DON'T TAKE IT BACK.

150
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:42,038
WE HAVE TO LIVE OUT OUR

151
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,739
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND THAT'S

152
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,574
WHAT WE AIM TO DO.

153
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:45,842
>> Shannon: THIS WILL SOON GO

154
00:03:45,843 --> 00:00:00,000
TO THE JUSTICES FOR A PRIVATE
