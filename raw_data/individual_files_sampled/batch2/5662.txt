bringing now a member of the Judiciary Committee Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island on Saturday senator Whitehouse served as a pallbearer at the memorial for Senator John McCain senator good morning it's great to have you with us want to talk to you about that moving day on Saturday but first you are on the Judiciary Committee your reaction to the president's tweet the latest reminder that he views the Justice Department as an institution there to protect him well you've got to remember this is a guy whose campaign began with mob champs of lock her up so they got off to a really bad start with respect to how the justice system is supposed to work and this is just another I guess ominous whiff of the generalissimo justice that this guy seems to like in which the justice system is not blind and does not go forward based on evidence but goes forward based on politics and the welfare and wishes of the president United States it's just to uh to any former prosecutor it's just disgusting do you see senator in that tweet obstruction of justice well you'd need to actually move to a proceeding that was being obstructed I certainly think that it could be evidence of obstruction of justice once you've got to defining which entity of the justice system was being obstructed so senator you also obviously will be seated in just a couple of hours now and hearing the initial hearing for judge Kavanagh Brett Kavanaugh president's appointee for the Supreme Court what's the first question you'd like to ask him well I don't want to Telegraph that but I do think that what you're gonna see is is a lot of boiling mad Democrats on the Judiciary Committee there has been a real banana republic process that has gotten here those of us who are lawyers think that the obvious comparison is to the discovery process and a trial imagine one party in a trial telling the other party while you do all this discovery but we only can give you about 10 or 15 percent of it and we're gonna make up a rule that says you can't talk about that publicly and now they've claimed this completely phony executive privilege it's not even a proper assertion of executive privilege and night after the close of business on the last day of a holiday weekend we got a document dump of 42,000 pages of documents the idea that any judge in the United States would go forward to the trial the day after a document dump like that is preposterous and yet here we are going ahead because they're so desperate to jam this guy onto the court so the ultimate question to go back to where we started the ultimate question here is why are they so desperate to jam this guy onto the court well senator why would Democrats even show up at a hearing that you talk about a banana republic ID sorry if they dumped 42,000 documents on you on Labor Day when they know you're not going to be able to review them after you all have been asking for those documents for weeks you've been asking for full transparency for weeks you know that the Republicans in the Senate have been doing everything they can to muddy up the process as much as possible why do you not why do Democrats even show up today why do it seems to me it's a better fund America Americans Americans would understand if you say you know what we just got these documents we will show up on Wednesday we're going to read the documents and not let you roll steamroll over us that's one way to go at it I think for most of us the feeling is that this is an opportunity to make the case people have not been paying attention to this so far about what's going on they've been paying attention to the ceremony is honoring John McCain they've been paying attention to the president's tweets this is a chance for us to really make that case hard at a moment when the American public is looking at this botched process so Casey senator to pick up on Joe's point you said you call this a Banana Republic process I mean that's a pretty it's a pretty serious allegation I mean would you view his position on the court as illegitimate if he is confirmed well we need to go through the hearings but I think that you know he is a person who could stop all this nonsense in a minute by saying I'm not gonna take the oath of office if I don't go through a legitimate process as a judge I know he's never tried a case but he's still been the judge and he ought to know something about discovery he ought to know that these last-minute document are wrong you ought to know as a lawyer that there is no such thing under the committee rules as committee confidential you ought to know that the people who are responsible for providing discovery don't get to give 10% of it or 12% of it and keep the rest and he ought to be sending a signal as somebody who's supposed to represent justice on the court look I'm not gonna put up with this this is being done for my benefit I'm blowing the whistle on it so the fact that he is complicit in it in this way I think it's gonna be a lasting taint on him Sam Stein the senator if there is no such thing as committee confidential if you believe that this is an illegitimate process why not just put out the four to two thousand documents yourself you have access to them you could post them online don't the public deserve to see the same documents well that's one way we could proceed I think that so far the decision has been made to not release at all at this point but we may very well do that so I don't understand I can just walk me through because I hear from a lot of very frustrated progressives who do follow this very closely they hear you guys say this is illegitimate they hear you guys note that the president is under a CO an unnamed co-conspirator in a crime that there's an investigation going on this shouldn't proceed and yet the Democrats who are on the committee are not taking the most aggressive steps they're not stepping out of the hearing as Joe Illustrated they're not releasing the documents that are supposedly committee confidential what is the disconnect here why are you guys not fighting this more aggressively if you think this is such an existential threat because I think that I can't speak for others but I think that the committee process is the best place to make these points I don't think Americans frankly respect people very much who walk out of their jobs when there's a fight to be had and I think it's important that we take this forum and have that fight other people disagree and and I think that's a very fair disagreement I'm not criticizing them but my feeling is when there's a fight in front of you go have it all right Sheldon Whitehouse thank you so much greatly appreciate you being with us good luck you know Sam I want to go back to you on that point I don't understand why the Democrats are even showing up they've been talking about this the lack of transparency from the very beginning if I were on a committee with that one of the most important things that came before my committee in my career which is this Kavanagh appointment which could fundamentally alter the balance of the Supreme Court for the next generation and the Republicans refused to be transparent about it you know I would certainly recommend everybody around me not show up for the hearing because as they said you know if they think it's like a banana republic if they think they've been lied to if they think that that these documents have been kept from them I mean they did a document dump on Labor Day 42,000 documents don't you don't participate in a process that is that flawed you review the documents and say we're going to review the documents and we will see you on Wednesday or Thursday oh yeah it's not just the 42,000 there was a hundred thousand documents that were held for presidential privilege and that was announced on Friday of Labor Day weekend which was conspicuously time news stump as well you know it just goes to the fact that when it comes to judicial nominations in the federal courts the two parties are playing entirely different ball games here Republicans as everyone will recall just didn't take a hearing on Merrick garland they refused to meet with him they didn't hold the hearing they said we will wait eight months they even floated the idea of holding the Supreme Court seat open having eight members of Supreme Court for Hillary Clinton's presidency this was a thing that was discussed it wasn't just Ted Cruz John McCain actually discussed the idea for a while and Democrats you know you can say to their credit or to their detriment and depending on your vantage point you just play different just play differently they are engaging through a respecting the norms and they feel like they should go at this through those processes and there's a huge brewing frustration among progresses over the fact that they are not more aggressively adjudicating this they're not more aggressively attacking kavanah and that they are going to sit in that hearing room today and tomorrow asking pointed questions that ultimately let the process move forward so Gene Robinson when these documents were dumped last night the 42,000 documents Chuck Schumer the Democrat from New York suggested delaying the earrings and we can't possibly process all this and be prepared to question judge Kavanaugh that's not going to happen the hearings gonna start in about two hours from now and at the end of the day despite all this despite the announcement on Friday of Labor Day weekend that the White House would withhold documents during Judge Cavanaugh's time in the bush White House over executive privilege Republicans have the votes here yeah they have the votes and they're gonna they're gonna cram this through just as a practical matter you know II guess 42,000 documents the day before the hearing is you know start I I agree with Joe I don't understand why Democrats would would show up under these circumstances but if you planted to show up and you plan to fight the fight that White House referred to put them on the Internet put those forty two thousand documents on the Internet now crowdsource the discovery essentially calling all lawyers good let's let's let's go through these you know this is that's a sort of you know 2018 way of dealing with with this sort of thing that wasn't available before but I guarantee there's enough lawyers out there and people knowledgeable about this stuff who would be happy to pour it through those forty two thousand documents faster than you can imagine and and find out what's what's in it so there there are a lot of the either it's more than one sort of sort of remedy that I think the Democrats could have taken here that that they're just not availing themselves off and I I don't understand why Steve Schmidt I think you probably maybe it's because we're two former Republicans we think about this differently but if somebody comes to you know a legislative fight with a club I'm gonna make sure my clubs bigger or I'm carrying something that's more politically lethal but the Democrats here just seem to be sort of lying down and taking it you know you don't allow these sort of document dumps the day before the most important Supreme Court nomination fight in recent American history you you take other steps but it seems the Democrats are just quietly marching in line here well I listening to Senator Whitehouse so I have a lot of respect for it just seems that the Democrats are absolutely determined to bring butter knifes to every gunfight forever and I don't understand it and I'll tell you this I ran two Supreme Court confirmations when I was in the bush White House for the Chief Justice Roberts for Justice Alito and 100% had we dumped 42,000 documents the night before the hearing in that time in that era those hearings would not have gone forward and there are two fundamental issues here and I like Brett Kavanaugh he was a White House colleague in the truth of this is and we step outside all the demagoguery around it he's exactly the same guy that Marco Rubio would have appointed or Chris Christie or any one of the other mainstream Republicans and I say this is somebody who publicly supported the confirmations of Sotomayor and Justice Kagan and who believes that presidents should have wide discretion to appoint Supreme Court justices within the broad mainstream of America's of American jurisprudence right that's what presidential elections are about the seat by definition is illegitimate because Merrick garland was not afforded the confirmation hearings that he was entitled titled to have in a legitimate appointment by the President of the United States who was who was reelected with a majority of the vote in in 2012 and so when we when we look at this hearing not to mention since he was nominated with the michael cohen indictment essentially what we have is the President of the United States criminally is an unindicted co-conspirator here and so and and so the legitimacy of this seat is fundamentally in question this process is profoundly broken and the idea that the Democrats would say in the argument it makes no sense that well we have right to see these documents but we're not going to release them to the American people when you could release them to the American people it's just extraordinary and I don't understand what the political strategy to win the fight is I mean what is the question to a Democrat you say what is your plan what give me any conceivable you know I really save you stop this guy from getting on the Supreme Court and I don't think they could answer the question so it's one that has a predetermined outcome that they lose before they start it and again I say this is a former Republican you a former Republican strategist I don't I do not understand what these Democrats are thinking I don't understand their lack of fight I don't understand how they allow an illegitimate honey this process is illegitimate mm-hmm it big it started illegitimate Lee as you said with Merrick garland and and now Matt Miller the the the Republicans have have basically hidden about a hundred and fifty thousand documents from Democrats that they have been begging for over the past several weeks no judge in America would allow an opposing side to dump a hundred and fifty thousand documents on on on on another party in a lawsuit the the day before a hearing started or a trial started again I'm completely baffled I why do the wider Democrats why are they even showing up they should not show up they should hold a press conference and they should publicly with cameras on them go through the forty two thousand documents they just got yesterday and the 100,000 plus documents they got on the Friday before Labor Day weekend have the cameras come into the room have them review the documents let Americans see that there they're actually trying to figure out what facts are relevant before they appoint a guy to a lifetime appointment to the United States Supreme Court a guy who may overturn Roe a guy who may overturn a variety of very very important precedents in this country you know Joe there's not just a split between Democrats in Washington and the grassroots on this question as Sam was alluding to there is also a split among Democrats in the Senate especially on the Judiciary Committee you could hear some of the discomfort and Sheldon Whitehouse his voice when he was asked the question when you asked him why they don't just release these documents or when Sam asked asked him that question why don't you just release these documents and he said well the decision has been made this very passive voice answer to the question there are a number of Democrats on that committee senator Whitehouse you know senator Blumenthal senator Harris who I think would take a more aggressive approach the ranking member of that of that committee senator Feinstein has been less aggressive on this question on this issue she's been less aggressive on some of the other questions of corruption inside the Trump administration she's been less aggressive and taking on the chairman chuck Grassley and I think you know look Democrats kind of arrange themselves by seniority and because she's the ranking member in the lead Democrat senator Feinstein has a great deal of discretion on House and Democrats prosecute this case and I don't want to put all the blame on her but I do think there is a group of Democrats on that committee if you ask if you strapped you know if you if you get strapped senator Whitehouse down and gave him some truth to him and asked him what would you do would you have a press conference and release these documents would you walk out of this committee and do that I think you would say I think he would say yes and that's just not what the leadership of the committee wants to do yeah and Matt Miller thank you very much mark Leibovich means the process it should be it should be followed but you can't really follow a process when you get documents 42,000 pages or more the night before and it seems like some Democrats were against this before they even had a chance to look yeah I mean I think look the sort of the macro lesson here I think is essentially whatever party controls the Senate can do whatever they want I mean I think the Merrick garland decision kind of like ensured that I mean that that's sort of what's going on doesn't matter who the president is I mean does anyone doubt for a second that if somehow the Democrats get control of the Senate there's a Supreme Court opening se next year or something like there that seats not gonna sit open for two years or a year and a half that's just sort of the way these things go and I completely agree with Matt Miller I when I was listening to Senator Whitehouse I heard the same passivity and and look I mean I do think that if you're gonna do anything you do need some kind of guerrilla tactics and that would be putting these documents on the Internet but I think ultimately it's a matter of control and what sort of the norm of what Judicial Appointments unfortunately now are becoming alright mark Leibovich thank you very much his book big game the NFL in dangerous times out today congratulations thank you very
