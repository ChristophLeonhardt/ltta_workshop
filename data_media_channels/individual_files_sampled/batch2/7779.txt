in Louisiana state inmates are paid anywhere from 4 to 70 cents per hour to work in Baton Rouge state off hold on they say 4 cents an hour that's right 4 to 70 cents per hour we're on the topic of prison labor why not what's it why don't just stop pretending this ain't nothing what's with the four cents is it too so you can say we pay them yeah we pay that we pay these people they were can we pay them was Toy Fair is that what this is about that's in our cents what a joke couldn't even up it to the full nickel you didn't get a nickel yes four pennies yeah that's unbelievable and if they're paid in cash that's actually very wasteful yes penny is it costs like more to make them than it does like that's why we're trying to phase them out so it's like well here's four of them that's amazing so this program has been in place for decades and lawmakers voted recently to expand it and it's making some folks pretty uncomfortable the Southern Poverty Law Center said the prospect of close to free labor for the government provides an incentive for the state prison to keep more people incarcerated because here's the thing these aren't just it's not like this is just some type of work that prisoners are doing to kind of remote lies themselves or anything like that this is legitimate work that somebody could be getting paid a living wage to do and and this is this is exploitation so here's some of the things they're allowed to do Louisiana prisoners are allowed to do renovations maintenance construction projects custodial duties cooking gardening landscaping and this can be done at the state capital and correctional facility state press prisoners hold a variety of jobs at the governor's mansions as well and again they get paid for - 70 cents per hour the House bill 84 would allow the governor to authorize prisoners to also do work other than cleaning at the Department of Public Safety and correction headquarters in Baton Rouge and now the projects have to be worth less than $200,000 but that's still a pretty hefty project you know I mean there's a lot of pretty hefty projects that have a budget of under $200,000 that are pretty significant so this is this is in many ways modern-day slavery it's exactly modern-day slavery and and I want to point out two things one it's really unfair to to these prisoners number two it's really unfair to non prisoners who are now squeezed out of a job they're squeezed out of a living wage right because why pay a regular person a living wage we can just pay a prisoner four cents an hour four cents an hour I can't get over that number around four cents are you kidding me there's literally nothing you can buy for four cents I mean when I was a little kid I think you buy a like a bazooka bubblegum for five cents but there's nothing buy for four cents in America you go to any store there's nothing for four cents so you work for a whole hour and you go to like a 7-eleven there's nothing can buy not one thing it's incredible so so this is a real problem and then again you I've said this before we have stripped away the naked brutality of slavery so we don't we don't just rape people and sell off families and just you know and Lynch them and kill them other we do some of that in other ways but we don't just do it the way they that it used to be that under slavery but we've totally preserved the economic part of slavery and just called it you know prisoners and so the Southern Poverty Law Center is exactly correct if you can monetize and profit from prisoners well not even incentive to have more prisoners how do you get more prisoners you pass laws that are draconian and you criminalize prior behavior that's you know that used to not be criminal so for example there is a whole school to Prison Pipeline truancy is a crime you can go to jail for skipping school what like when I was a kid if you skip school you just got suspension or detention or what in-school detention in-school suspension because there's one reward you by suspending if you don't cut you off to school right but now that's a crime in certain jurisdictions I'm sure if you go to like a rich neighborhood and it's a good rich white kid they won't be put in jail for truancy because they skipped to go to Burning Man for the week but if it's a poor neighbourhood with low-income people with little resources truancy is a crime to kill to jail for that that's just one of it one of the many things that are over criminalized but of course we all know it's the drugs it's a drug laws mm-hmm the draconian drug laws incarcerate so many people and despite crime rates plummeting across the nation we have more people in prison than ever before and our country imprisons more people than any other country in the world how can we say we're the land of the free and the home of the brave that's it's just so sad on so many levels and this cuts really to the heart of what this country is founded on right we talk about life liberty and justice I'm sorry life liberty and pursuit of happiness well there's no liberty here I mean you are just captured put into a prison system and then forced to work and the other clever thing that they do is once you are in the system you're labeled as a as a felon or criminal it's hard for you to get a job in the future so this is this is so wrong in so many levels and we have to not allow this to happen I mean this is unconscionable prisoners who work should get paid a fair wage that way it doesn't erode the pay scale for non prisoners who are also working yeah and and you know you mentioned that it's harder for folks to get jobs once they get out they also don't get to vote you know so that's another thing and then you know we have more people in prison than pretty much anywhere else in the world and that's largely because our system is so corrupt that it creates a demand for prisoners on two different levels like we have this for-profit prison system so so right away there's like a demand for prisoners now which is just morally repulsive by itself then you factor in prison labor and and that goes on I mean you know we're focusing on the Louisiana story right now but this is something that goes on all across the country and not too long ago right here in California we had people going out fighting those wildfires we had prisoners fighting those water fire fires putting their lives on the line risking their lives and they were getting paid about a dollar a day in most cases a dollar a day to fight wild virus yeah battling nature yeah and and and that story was heartbreaking too because due to flight risk we use mostly female prisoners to fight the fires here in California and an about a third of the firefighters in California to fight other wildfires are prisoners most of them female and they risk all kinds of injury I think one of them died recently from an injury sustained while fighting a fire you know they've broken their ankles their shoulders and they have an option of getting paid about a dollar a day or I'm sorry is a dollar an hour I think that's dollar day dollar that is crazy or they have one day taken off their sentence for a day of actual firefighting man that is some serious exploitation of people hey I hope you enjoyed this clip there's a whole hour and a half of aggressive progressives waiting for you at
