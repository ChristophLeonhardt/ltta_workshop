prisons movement calm em VMT calm / co v a so we've got new juicy details coming up on this scintillating Supreme Court nomination process I know you're glued to your seats to see what shocking new allegation next is going to come up for a milquetoast federal judge with an unquestioned record of integrity until five seconds ago when it became politically convenient for analysis we now cut to Senate Democrats they're so serious aren't they those Senate Democrats they seem or they're such sober serious people so the the new the change in the story right now is that an ex-boyfriend an alleged ex-boyfriend of Christine Ford has come out of the woodwork they allegedly dated for about seven years and he and this isn't just some tabloid thing like he talked to Michael avenatti this is per a sworn testimony that was just released by Chuck Grassley the boyfriends name has been redacted thus far but Grassley is vouching for him he is contradicting a lot of Christine Ford's testimony he's saying that she and he would fly around all the time on airplanes she didn't have a fear of flying and she never mentioned a sexual assault to him now this part we know is true because initially remember Christine Ford said oh I can't testify before the Judiciary Committee because I'm I'm terribly afraid of flying it's incapacitating I just don't fly and then we found out she did she flies to New Hampshire she flies to Hawaii she that's a pretty long flight she flew to French Polynesia as she's flying all over the place so he said okay that doesn't seem to make a lot of sense she said well okay I got over it but I'm afraid of confined spaces I don't like small spaces this guy's saying they lived in a studio apartment of his 500 square feet or something like that he also says and this is crucial that he personally saw Christine Ford coach a friend of hers on how to beat a polygraph test now she was asked about this on during her testimony and so this really raises a lot of questions we will we'll get into what the woman who allegedly was helped by Ford says in a second but let's just take a look from that testimony when Rachel Mitchell the prosecutor hired by the Senate Judiciary Committee hones in on this question says did you ever help somebody to take a polygraph test here's what Christine Ford says have you ever had discussions with anyone besides your attorneys on how to take a polygraph never and I don't just mean countermeasures but I mean just any sort of tips or anything like that no I was scared of the test itself but was comfortable that I could tell the information and the test would reveal whatever it was going to reveal I didn't expect it to be as long as it was going to be so it was a little bit stressful hey have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test never now when this question came up during the hearing I think all of us were kind of scratching our heads saying what is this about why I know she took a polygraph but why are you focusing in for three questions on this now I think we see why and there's some weird stuff that comes out of Ford's testimony here she says oh I was so scared to take the polygraph test I was so afraid to take it but I did it anyway but Ford's people arranged the polygraph they paid for the polygraph test Ford chose to do that she volunteered to do this so if she was so afraid of it what nobody was making her it was just her own people doing it and she said oh it took so long I felt like I had told my whole life story it just it took so long to administer the polygraph test polygraph test was two questions actually the guy who did the polygraph test who administered it to her said oh yeah it was a friendly polygraph test that's why you know if this were a hostile polygraph test if we were prosecutors there was a criminal or investigators or something like that then it might have been a lot longer about two questions so okay that doesn't seem very long to ask two simple questions then she won't give us a lot of details about it they asked her when did you do the polygraph test did you do it on the day of your grandmother's funeral day after day before she said I don't remember well how do you not remember it was like a few weeks ago how could you not remember that now - to be fair to dr. Ford her friend who the ex-boyfriend alleges Ford helped to pass the polygraph test her friend denies all of this the woman's name is Monica McLean she said that she's never been helped by dr. Ford but the boyfriend does say this quote dr. Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraphs worked and helped McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam so now we have a he-said she-said by the way McLean signed a statement of support for dr. Ford a while long before these accusations came out but there are a lot of inconsistencies in her testimony so I don't really know she won't give us details about the polygraph she won't release the psychiatrist records which could validate some of what she said but apparently it contradicts a lot of her testimony and there are a lot of other claims too that seem to be popping up so according to this ex-boyfriend when he and Ford were in Hawaii they would fly around in a propeller plane so it's not just that she took a jetliner to Hawaii the woman who had such a terrible fear of flying when she couldn't go anywhere she apparently took a little prop plane this tiny little plane that you know if you're afraid of confined spaces don't get in a prop plane you can't you know you can barely move around in those things then another a huge one so because I got to tell you something uh we've seen sworn testimony we've seen public testimony be nonsense here right avenatti is client Julie sweat Nick is clearly a complete Looney tune but she's giving testimony so I don't know maybe the boyfriend is telling the truth maybe he isn't I've got no less reason to believe him than I have to believe Kristine Ford that's for sure and yet everybody especially on the left seems to be jumping to defend forward and trying to brush off this ex-boyfriends allegations but you'll remember I think a really key part of the forward testimony seems to be falling apart right now not because of it what the ex-boyfriend says but because of what the Palo Alto government says Jr where she said that she this whole thing came up this whole alleged sexual assault came up because they were remodeling their house for it and her husband and Ford wanted to put a second exterior door on the house because she need an escape plan from this childhood trauma that she couldn't get past and it was it was all about that so well I'll let I'll let her put it in her own words and then we'll see why her testimony is totally untrue I'd never told the details to anyone the specific details until May 2012 during a couples counseling session the reason this came up in counseling is that my husband and I had completed a very extensive very long remodel of our home and I insisted on a second front door an idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand in explaining why I wanted a second front door I began to describe the assault in detail so two claims here one that the second front door in her house was because she wanted an escape hatch to get out of there because stemming from the psychological trauma of this alleged assault 36 years earlier and two that the second door became an issue in her marriage in 2012 and that's when they had a couples counseling session about it and that's when some description of some assault came up Paul Sperry had real clear investigations has debunked a lot of this he showed that the permit to build an additional door in this house was not issued in 2012 but issued four years earlier on February 4th 2008 four years before the therapy session four years before this allegedly became a problem in their marriage and those records show that the door was a was not because she needed an escape hatch from this delayed psychological trauma but because she wanted a separate entrance to her marriage counseling office that that's very different than saying I need an escape hatch if you're running a little business out of your house to have a separate door makes perfect sense you I want people going into your foyer or your living room when they come into your office also its previously been reported that students from local colleges Google interns would stay in this extra room and they would have a spare door to go out of their own independent door when she was renting out the room okay now she's saying actually I mean look we know that Christine Ford's not great about dates she doesn't know if it's 36 years ago 35 years ago as she doesn't know if the session was four years ago or was six years ago whether it was ten years ago but that's a big discrepancy four years is a big discrepancy and it's not just about the time it's about the cause she's saying it was caused by psychological trauma made an issue about her marriage what the building permits showing what the timeline shows is this was about a separate marriage counseling office and about renting it out to college kids and Google interns so Christine Ford has told many untruths here untruths about flying on fruits about traveling untrue it's about where she was certainly untruths about who was at this alleged party we know this because she's changed her story between the Dianne Feinstein letter and the polygraph test and when she spoke before the Senate Judiciary Committee and when she talked to the therapist she's told untruths about not only who was at the party but who was in the room at the time and coincidentally coincidentally all of those varying truths always seem to trend in the direction of being unfalsifiable and of making Brett Cavanaugh's position indefensible making it such that he has no way to go back and said this didn't happen see here's the proof it all keeps changing so is she a liar I don't know is she telling untruths absolutely and day by day it seems that she's lying that's what it looks like before by the way we've got we've got the breaking news by the way and the evidence that Cavanaugh is innocent here's the best evidence we've got yet before we do that I have got to thank a wonderful sponsor at

keep adding up regardless of whether this boyfriend is legit between the travel between the the planning of building their house between the timing of accusations because I'm just starting to think maybe there's something a little fishy going on here the other reason I think this is because the left is moving on if the left the New York Times CNN the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee if they really believed that these Christiane Ford allegations were true they'd be harping on them notice that they're not harping on them they're talking about some party at Yale and his fraternity did something and he threw ice at a bar and blah blah blah whatever so on this point the New York Times has a new scoop this one just came out last night it's breaking news I don't know are you make sure you're sitting down if you're driving pull over to the side of the road this one is pretty shocking it turns out that in high school Brett Kavanaugh was a cool guy this is the scoop this is from the 1983 a letter from Brett Kavanaugh the New York Times reports quote one night during his senior year according to classmates who witnessed it judge Cavanaugh triumphantly hoisted an empty beer keg above his head in recognition that he and his friends were well on their way to reaching their goal of polishing off yeah I don't even know if I can say it 100 kegs during the academic year an achievement they later boasted about in their yearbook oh my gosh he probably smoked cigarettes - he probably smoked cigarettes do we are there is there any breaking news on that yet did he ever did he ever like eat too much candy on Halloween and then feel sick afterwards that monster bad guy I bet EJ walk - by the way I don't want to make I don't want to make uncorroborated accusations but I bet one time when the the red hand was on the sign he crossed the street anyway you sick monster you can't you don't have the temperament to be on the court you had beer in high school no but does anyone oh no everybody has fear in high school never mind I'm sorry I guess I got that wrong every single person this is the best they got they this one makes the ice throwing at the bar in New Haven seem like I don't know the Teapot Dome scandal you know I mean really this is really sad guys wonderful news for Brett Kavanaugh again cocaine Mitch seems to have been playing this pretty smart I really think this vote should happen two weeks ago but every day that this has been going on I really think it bodes well for Cavanaugh Lindsey Graham yesterday suggestion if they shoot down Cavanaugh if Jeff Flake for instance is signaling he might not vote for Cavanaugh because Jeff Flake is a despicable coward they're gonna change the word Quisling and the dictionaries would be flaking now and coincidentally I suppose that in a way that is sort of what flaking means so all nature is but art unknown today if they do that they should rename innate him it will be a red tsunami it will be a red wave we're gonna pick up a lot of states it's gonna be beautiful so either way I guess that's a win-win the Democrats are behaving in a really immoral way here this is beyond just tough politics I can forgive tough politics I get it it's not a big deal but to ruin this guy's life to say that we should not have any due process in America the people should be presumed guilty until proven innocent that is really wicked behavior that's really in oral and nobody is better at inverting morality and inverting virtue I think then Cory Booker in his weepy weird press conferences here is Cory Booker talking about our moral moment so my hope is that just beyond the vicious partisan rancor that is going on beyond the accusations we don't lose sight of what this moral moment is about in this country and ultimately ask ourselves the question is this the right person to sit on the highest court in the land for a life time appointment when their credibility has been challenged by intimates people that knew the candidate well as a classmate when his temperament has been revealed in an emotional moment where'd you use language that that frankly shocked a lot of us and then ultimately not whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial but ultimately have enough questions be raised that we should not move on to another candidate it's not about whether he's innocent or guilty you heard Cory Booker say it it does it who cares if he's innocent or guilty we don't like him so we're gonna ruin his life and call him a rapist Cory Booker by the way who wrote an op-ed about how he groped a girl at a party when he was a young man how he was groping her how he actually did what Brett Kavanaugh apparently has been falsely accused of doing what it seems the brick has been falsely accused of viewing cory booker actually did and he goes out there with his earnest face and his warbly little earnest voice and he says we're in a moral moment and that's why we need to destroy the innocent regardless of their innocence regardless of their guilt we need to destroy people without any evidence because I'm Cory Booker he and by the way I didn't notice this until now is just looking when Cory Booker gets his really earnest face on his eyes go a little googley they go one goes in a little bit in one direction one goes in the other presumably said one I can watch CNN and the other I can read the New York Times at the same time and get the ridiculous propaganda going into his head this is despicable moral moment he I say this all the time that the left uses language to mean the opposite of what it really means what he is he is describing moral behavior as running roughshod over people regardless of their guilt or innocence regardless of what they do and destroying their lives destroying their career and by the way most importantly undercutting our constitutional order undercutting the right of a president to appoint judges elections have consequences president from one the 2016 election I know that Democrats still deny that that happened but it did happen and he has the right to pick jurists American by the way the 2016 election was in many ways decided on the judges that President Trump would pick I'd think if Antonin Scalia had not died it was so close to the election probably a president Trump would've had a much harder time winning that election but he was elected largely to appoint these kinds of judges and Cory Booker is saying what we need to do is destroy innocent people destroy their lives based on nothing and he even admits I don't even care if they're guilty I don't even care if they're guilty any calls that a moral moment that is an immoral moment I know Cory Booker went to Yale Law School - it's amazing how much of the circles around all those ice throwing bars in New Haven but that that is the moral question here that is that he's twisting this language - twisting what he would his immoral behavior the immoral behavior of Kamala Harris of Dianne Feinstein of the entire Democratic caucus especially on the Senate Judiciary Committee it's really really bad he's saying if enough questions are raised then we should be able to ruin a man's life did Cory Booker collaborate with the Nazis did he I'm just asking questions did Cory Booker help the the fall of Rome did he hasten the fall of Rome by helping the various Goths and visit guts knock down the walls and come on over did that happen is that what I don't know if that's what happened I'm just asking questions I'm just asking questions but what do I know did Cory Booker blow up the Hindenburg hmm I'm just asking questions and a look I don't I don't know the Cory Booker called the cause the fall of Rome I don't know that Cory Booker collaborated with the Nazis and I don't know whether or not he blew up the Hindenburg but enough questions have been raised that I think at this point it is only right and fair for Cory Booker to resign his seat in the United States Senate we have to move on this is a moral moment okay enough how many questions have been raised I just raised like three how many other but I bet you guys are raising questions in the comments and on Twitter right now there are a lot of questions it's the only right thing to do is for Cory Booker to step down to turn himself in to the police to serve a life sentence for collaborating with the Nazis questions questions have been raised so that's their moment and I actually like this moral moment one cuz I get to make fun of Cory Booker but - because injustice a feeling of injustice is driving people in droves toward the GOP driving them in droves this was the thought in 2016 the thought that Hillary Clinton could get away with what she did you know Richard Nixon lost the prep resigned the presidency after he won a landslide election he resigned the presidency because he deleted 11 minutes of tape Hillary Clinton used a bleached bit to wipe entire servers destroy years and years of federal records what did this federal records show I guess we'll never know because she deleted those records and what did she face what was her consequence for that nothing nothing and that injustice drove a lot of people to the polls the judicial system our system of justice drove a lot of people to the polls because people felt that the Constitution wasn't being respected that left-wing activist jurists were running roughshod over our founding document in the framework of our republic drove a lot of people to the polls I think it's doing the exact same now I think people are watching this Cavanaugh circus and they're saying cory booker are you out of your mind no it does matter if he's innocent or guilty it does matter if people make accusations within statutes of limitations it does matter if there's evidence corroboration or if people are contradicting themselves in testimony like christine ford justice does matter so keep it up man you know republicans are shooting way up in the polls in these swing states in seats they're seven seats that are being held by democrats that's happening in north dakota it's happening in Missouri it's happening in Montana it's happening in India it's having it all over the place so keep going man keep talking about how it doesn't matter guilt or innocence this this cynical question that we find all the way back in Scripture which is what is truth Oh what is truth fine keep asking it we're gonna we're gonna get that red wave in November Alyssa Milano is demonstrating this beautifully I love Alyssa Milano she you know she's been the craziest of the of the anti Cavanaugh people she showed up to the hearing I don't know why she should Diane Feinstein invited her so that she could she was sitting there at the hearing oh shit because she thought she was in a movie or something there's Brett Kavanaugh up there and she's got her glasses down holding up a believe all women sign she's staring daggers into the guy the trouble for Alyssa Milano just like the trouble for Democrats is that the Internet is forever in history is long so I don't know who dug it up yesterday flicka's talks Austin Fletcher sent sent it over to me there was a 2012 tweet that Alyssa Milano sent down the tweet reads quote Bill Clinton I love you so much like crazy amounts of love Alyssa Milano hashtag believe all women holding up the believe all women well she says Brett Kavanaugh is a rapist he hasn't even actually been accused of rape other than by a vanadis of loony-tune client but it certainly hasn't been accused by rape of doctor Ford or anybody and she said I believe all women Calvin o has got to go down I love Bill Clinton like crazy amounts of love now let's not forget for those of you who need a little refresher in history Bill Clinton has been credibly accused of sexual assault I know we bandy that word about a lot but if talking if any accusations are credible it's the ones against Bill Clinton he's accused of rape by wanita Broderick he was accused of assault by Kathleen Willey Leslie Mill we and Paula Jones of exposing himself to her this is going on for years it happened the accusations came out much closer to the alleged events and they've stuck by their story for years and years and years and in some cases there were there was corroborating evidence and we know that his derelicts sexual behavior in office came out because he was having sexual relations with a 22 year old 21 year old intern in the Oval Office well he was president how do we know that because of that little blue dress so talk about credible accusations there Alyssa Milano doesn't care and this is my real issue with this because what the Cavanaugh circus is really about as Roe vs. Wade is whether we're going to have nine rogue dictators on the court telling us how we're going to live our lives or whether we're going to leave that up to the American people and whether certain states can have whatever they want and certain states can have other laws and Roe vs. Wade took that question of abortion out of the court of public opinion out of the legislative process out of the democratic process where it belongs and we've been fighting about it ever since it's where the working came from its where the torpedoing of Robert Bork's nomination came from it's where Clarence Thomas's attacks came from and it's where this Cavanaugh attack is coming from I can acknowledge the political dimension of this Democrats want they preen and they moralize and they get up on their soapbox and they say we believe all women you don't believe women you just said your life Bill Clinton he's been accused of sexual assault by multiple people for years and years and years so oh never mind never mind that's fine look if you want to say the policy is more important than the moral behavior of this one guy fair enough point if you believe that but don't get up there and tell me that I'm some immoral person because I think that people should be assumed to innocent until proven guilty or that the questions of public policy like abortion should be left in the legislature where they belong or that there's no constitutional right to an abortion or that thirty allegations that were not made for 36 years where there's no corroboration whatsoever even by the people the accuser names that maybe they're not totally credible don't get up there and moralize and call me a wicked person or a misogynist or whatever it's an outrage it just isn't true so then the question we have to bring ourselves to is why are we talking about sex so much why is there so much sex let's talk about sex baby and we mentioned yesterday that rapist is the new racist it's just the disgusting epithet that they throw at people that they don't like when you're on the left but part of the reason that we're so obsessed with sex first of all is a sexual revolution ever since the 1960s people have just talked about sex a lot more it's been much more public people have been much freer with sex which is you know some people enjoy that for a certain time Lord make me chaste but not yet as Saint Augustine once said but it has really permeated all aspects of the culture why else because it's scintillating sex has always been scintillating there have always been sex scandals in politics but I think most importantly it's because the left lacks maturity you know they wear the hats of genitalia on their head every single line every little joke every argument they make is suck this and f-that do this and screw that and you know it gets a little their vocabulary is a little small it's because they lack the maturity and the intellectual resources to discuss substantive disagreements they do there was that study from John Hite a few years ago that said that the right basically understands the left the left doesn't really understand the right very well at all and I've always found this to be true I do is at this event with a bunch of lefties the other night in Hollywood I don't think they understand our point of view they can't articulate it they have a very limited vocabulary and so they only they limit their vocabulary to like five words all of which are scatological or gynecological or whatever genital and you see this now especially in their PSAs there have been versions of this before but those kids and by kids I mean Scooter Braun and George Clooney and all the Hollywood elites who actually are behind it the ones actually behind the march for our lives the anti-gun group they have a new PSA out telling people why they should vote but wait there's a little twist who are you ready it's so clever here we go my first time I was nervous my first time wasn't the back of the fire I was in a church it was amazing my first time everybody clapped afterwards I mean I didn't know how to do it way too pretty you know there were so many options like you never know what its gonna be like when it actually when you do it so finally I just I just went just did it I voted my first time with a woman was it felt good but it ended bet you get it it's about sex you oh you thought it was about sex it's about then it was about voting it was about sex now it's about voting ha ha ha ha so this is about the level of political discourse on the left and also just so sad like you know the that guys you know my first time with a woman was Duda you know he's wearing like the Democrat uniform I don't know he's kind of like doing a little pout and everything it's really sad it's really to borrow a phrase from our president sad not not the manliest display here and masculinity does really play a role in all of this well we'll get to that with Kanye West we'll get to that beyond Kanye West we'll get to that with Ambassador John Bolton is something that a lot of people aren't talking about when they discussed the Trump phenomenon what's going on with Kavanagh what's going on in our politics is manliness masculinity a bad word for a long time common back in style will into all of that but first I've gotta say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube if you're on daily wire.com thank you very much you help keep the lights on you'll keep coffey in my cup if you're on facebook and youtube go to daily wire.com you'll get me you'll get the intro clayvin sure you get the Ben Shapiro show your test questions in the mailbag you test questions in the conversation none of that matters that mm hmm that's pretty good this batch this is an upcoming vintage this is the vintage for after the election we're gonna release this vintage after the election and we're serving it up from all of the people who were telling everyone to go out and vote and then they're gonna be shocked when they all vote for Republicans when they all vote for Donald Trump this is a kind of a play we knew the 2016 vintage was so popular we wanted to release it again in 2018 but Cavanagh better get confirmed for us to be able to release it by the way I got to tell you this Friday daily wire will be launching the next chapter of the podcast that I've been working on with Andrew Clavin another Kingdom a drew rodent I perform it this is the first season was super popular we didn't expect it to catch on like it did this season if you're not caught up it's gonna be available on the website the first season is also going to be available on the website subscribers to daily wire will get early access to each episode and all of it will be ad free this season is super cool because we've added this incredible visual component to it last time I was shooting it in Drew's attic it was all audio you heard like ambulances in the background it wasn't the best studio setup this time we've got a set we've got a visual component and it really enhances Drew's phenomenal story it's a really really good story and look the only times that I ever get hired to be an actor anymore or by Carolla and dennis prager Ted Cruz and Andrew Clavin that's you've got to catch it presumably it'll be my last acting job I ever have in my life go to daily wire comm and subscribe so a lot of this actually this is sort of a tie-in with another Kingdom another Kingdom explores themes of masculinity and what it means masculinity and femininity we're talking about sex baby this whole shows about sex this whole two weeks three weeks has been about sex what we saw in that commercial I voted for the first time blah blah blah is people say I voted for a woman Oh was so nice it's this kind of meek timid tee-hee-hee oh I'm really gentle I'm okay but where's the confidence where's the masculinity where is telling it like it is a lot of this Trump moment is telling it like it is it's a lot of COFA a it's a lot of dragon energy who better to expound on this than Kanye West he was sitting down with the head of TMZ the head of TMZ begging him begging him to stop wearing that Magga hat that donald trump hat Kanye West looks him right in his face and tells it like it is there's something you love about me yes I would love it Kanye if you would not wear that hat it would make me and a lot of other people feel better in fact why don't we say please take off the hat Kanye how's that is that good ah then I won't do it because you have a right to wear it but that's amazing baby First Amendment as an American I support our president bottom line no matter who they are as an American I support our president now I already told you what this represent for me this represents y'all can't bully me y'all can't bully me because you can't tell me what to do because that's what people used to do they would snatch yo hat off you have a starter cap and like a big a gangbanger come up and try to rip your hat off and ain't nobody ripping my hat off again so that's what it represents to me it also represents for me masculine energy this is exactly right again I know we're living in the matrix because Lindsey Graham is the backbone of the GOP and Kanye West is the voice of reason but he's exactly right I love that at the beginning that TMZ guy he says take it off please take off that please take off the Hat Kanye West says I'm not gonna take off that hat mm not gonna do it Alyssa Milano sent out this tweet yesterday of Kanye dressed up like Trump with the Trump hair and everything and it said make Kanye Kanye again M kka I think she's missing another K I think that third K is missing somewhere from her tweet because what she's saying is you are Kanye West what does that mean you're Kanye West you look a certain way you talk a certain way you behave a certain way you work a certain way you're in a certain industry you can't be a republic rat this party owns you and you better kowtow to the party line and he's saying no I'm not gonna do it I'm not gonna do it he says later on in that interview he says I support our president whoever it is now I'm old enough to remember when he said George W Bush doesn't care about black people so I don't know that he always supported the president no matter who it is I think he especially supports Donald Trump I think they're kindred spirits I think they both have dragon energy and what does that mean he spells out what it means he said it's about masculinity there's a masculine energy there and that is of course there is that's why everything is becoming about sexier that's why everything is becoming Donald Trump is a an abuser he because he only paid stormy Daniels $150,000 he should have given her $200,000 and Cavanaugh is a rapist even though he's never been accused of anything like that ever in his entire life and this guy and this it's all about masculinity because we are staring down the left right now and you're saying they're just nagging us to death they're saying well please I know it may be he's guilty maybe he's innocent but you just have to wait for him and you have to and you have to and you have to and we're looking Cory Booker right in his quivering bizarre googly eyed face and we're saying no you don't get to bully us into doing this not anymore sorry buddy but I really want you to take the head off not gonna tell wearing two heads now I'm gonna wear to it I'm gonna wear a hat on my head I'm gonna wear I had on each fist I'm gonna wear a hat on my kneecaps you can't bully us anymore and that is masculine I hardly Mansfield this great book about manliness a number of years ago and masculinity is not just like knuckle-dragging manliness is not just being some brute to be a man is to be a gentleman to holding the door harvey describes it very well in this book where he says the manliness is when you hold the door open for a woman and you tell her to pass through and then when there is some robber in the room or some criminal is walking by you look her in the face and you say get out of my way and you go and you fight the guy you know that those are two sides of manliness one is aggressive and strong one is gentlemanly and chivalrous but there are two sides of it and for a long time we've been told that masculinity is toxic masculinity is evil it's bad the future is feminine men are scum men or trash these are hashtags that go around feminist twitter I'm not making this up and what guys like all the way from Kanye West to Donald Trump to John Bolton to Brett Kavanaugh or saying is no you're not gonna bully us you're not going to push us around and quivering lips and fake crocodile tears from the likes of Cory Booker and Diane Feinstein aren't gonna work anymore you're not going to manipulate us you're not going to twist our emotions to pervert justice to pervert the meaning of language and to pervert or constitutional republic just ain't gonna happen sorry buddy and they can't take it they haven't been Democrats have not been talked to this way in a very long time but it's a beautiful thing and that's virtuous the Democrats virtue signal but that's virtue virtue comes from veer the Latin word veer which is man there's a manly component to virtue it ties in with political correctness it ties in with this innocent until proven guilty and not getting torpedoed for saying impolite words on a hidden camera for not believing one sex over the other believe all women don't believe any men believe women by virtue of their being women disbelieve men by virtue of their being men it ties into policy to the United Nations to Israel to North Korea to the trade deals to the International Criminal Court John Bolten some of this up beautifully the other day you know he was he was asked he referred to the so called state of Palestine and he the some reporter said well isn't that offend of language and he said that's what it is Palestine is not a state you keep referring to it as a state so it's a so-called state but it's not a state doesn't meet the criteria of a state it hasn't been recognized as a state ever it's not a state she said okay but but it's offensive it's true sometimes the truth is offensive sad sorry sorry get used to it the international criminal the International Court of Justice rather at the United Nations right now is ordering the United States to lift its sanctions of Iran you know like the worst people on planet earth you're saying the United States has to lift the sanctions on Iran and do you know what the United States if this were the Obama administration that's okay we'll fly over three more airplanes full of cash but because this is the Trump administration because we have a little of that masculine Kayne energy do you know what the United States said to the UN for those of you who are only listening because you don't subscribe I just made a Sicilian gesture where I put my four fingers under my chin and flicked it forward that's what the United States is doing to the United Nations right now so we don't care what you think we don't care enforce your absurd and despicable and in-world rulings enforce your orders on the United States good luck buddy part of why the left is so angry right now is the humor of it all because we're mocking them we're mocking these people who say isn't the State of Palestine you know what to call it SoCo that's offensive we said why is it offensive it's true do you remember during the 2016 campaign one of the moments Trump won me over is when he referred to anchor babies and some reporter said that's offensive he said what's offensive so you should call him future future dreaming American dreamer or citizen and he said yeah I'm gonna stick with anchor baby that was very funny we're mocking these silly notions and this is what President Trump did last night he mocked the inconsistencies the vague and in many ways untrue in many instances demonstrably false accusations being hurled at the 11th hour against Brett Kavanaugh and it was hilarious and the leftist furious take it away president Covino what he's going through 36 years ago this happened I had one beer right I had one beer well you think it was it nope that was one oh good how did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was it I don't know I don't know I don't know what neighborhood was it in I don't know where's the house at her room upstairs downstairs where was I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing I remember and a man's life is in tatters a man's life is shattered his wife has shattered his daughters who have beautiful incredible young kids they destroy people they want to destroy people these are really evil people he's going to holding no punches back and he's having fun while he's doing it he's having fun while he's doing it and they're so furious what is he mocking here he isn't i I just want to be very specific on where the comedy is here he isn't mocking Ford's appearance he isn't mocking the way that she speaks exactly she isn't do it you know he got in trouble because he mocked a reporter who had turned out had a disability and he kind of made him look spastic even though the reporter is not spastic even though Trump has done the same impression for plenty of other people that he just thinks aren't all that bright and that he disagrees with but he got in trouble for that that's not what he's mocking here what he's mocking here is the flimsiness of the accusations and he is exactly right to do it he I mean I've been doing it now for a few days so I I hope he's right to do it these are so flimsy and it's perfectly right to mock them we should be ready to mock them much more the left says how dare you how did that's toxic masculinity you can't laugh it's super serious I don't care if he's innocent or guilty it's super serious we're saying no it's not come down you're being ridiculous shh shh stop it Cory stop you're being ridiculous sit down sit down right now and it's it's a wonderful thing I'm glad that we get to finally see that here I think we should use humor a lot more I think a lot of people are glad that in this culture where you've got the left totally addicted to outrage purple hair no screaming you know serious chasing Republicans to their homes keeping their children up at night forcing them out of restaurants behaving like little punk thug children criminals that we can laugh at them we're not going to take them seriously we're not going to take them seriously and we're not going to take inconsistent flimsy vague constantly changing last-minute eleventh-hour charges to derail a perfectly legitimate a Supreme Court nominee of hitherto unquestioned integrity and character we're not going to take those seriously either if you want to bring some serious allegations with any corroborating evidence actually with any any evidence that it doesn't get counter corroborated that doesn't get refuted immediately by the people you name then maybe we can talk about it but if you're gonna bring us this flimsy nonsense get out of here what are you talking about get it you don't get to do that maybe you get to do that in you know in the old days not anymore that's a beautiful thing I will quickly mention because all nature is but are not unknown today on this day in history in 1995 OJ Simpson was acquitted he was acquitted of double murder this was after a 252 day trial it was kind of like the Cavanaugh hearings it was all anybody in the country could talk about for a long time he was acquitted of murder of Nicole Brown Simpson his wife and Ronald Goldman her friend so that justice was served right Oh Jay got off justice was served not quite there was a civil trial and OJ was found liable in that civil trial he had to pay out thirty five or thirty three million dollars why do I bring this up it's because justice isn't always clear justice it you know it is it was the criminal trial was that justice I don't know was the civil trial was that justice I don't know about that well Tom Robinson in To Kill a Mockingbird was accused of raping Mayella you'll remember do we believe all women in that case shook you because it turns out he didn't rape her he was a scapegoat because he was black do we should we believe all women in that case believe maiella believe mrs. you miss you'll okay I don't think so social justice is not justice virtue signaling is not virtue and you got to be very precise about what's going on because I think on the left I heard this the other night at this event in Hollywood they're calling this guy a rapist no no serious person other than that Looney tune from Havana nobody is even coming close to accusing him of rape but they are they're saying it's so clear it's so clear all shallows are clear all shallows are clear and we should be very very specific about where the justice is who the victim is in this case just take a quick look this was on our campus recently what happened to a group of students who were campaigning and demonstrating in support of Brett Kavanaugh in support of due process and against kangaroo courts there's a kid at the very end there is just he flicks the camera ran and he's like smiling cuz it's so ridiculous and so great on you kid great for getting that on video the this woman is filled with righteous indignation and virtue signaling she's saying you're disrespecting survivors by suggesting that the accused have the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty that they have the right to due process this is how demagogues work they take you know heresy is not the promotion of Vice / virtue it's the promotion of one virtue to the exclusion of the others and that isn't virtue when you come out you say I want to support victims of sexual assault yeah of Korda doesn't we all do but when you use that as an excuse to trample the rights of the accused to trample good men to destroy their lives and when you do it not because you believe women not because Alyssa Milano believes Juanita Broderick but because you just want to push your own petty political agenda that is not virtue that's the opposite of virtue but all shallows are clear and I hope that we can pay attention to how justice will be meted out in this case all right we ran late we always do I will see you tomorrow make sure you get your mailbag questions in on Thursday get ready for another Kingdom on Friday in
