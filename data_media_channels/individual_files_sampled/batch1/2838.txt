what destroys an intimate relationship that's easy it's focusing on yourself the more you focus on yourself the more you will distance yourself from your relationship the more the person will feel not important unloving I don't care how great the relationship started out think about it in the beginning a relationship when you really desire somebody when you really love somebody what will you do for them the answer is anything right anyway they say would you take out the trash take out the trash happy to do it but after seven days seven years seven decades whatever it is there's a point when someone says you take out the trash you go what do I look like your janitor anybody know what it was we used to have so much passion the more you make a relationship about what you're getting the weaker the relationship is a relationship an intimate relationship is not a place you go to get things if you do that you're always gonna be disappointed space you're gonna give things if you can fall in love with somebody so much that you live to light them up and lighting not light you up done deal if you do what you did in the beginning of the relationship at the end of the relationship there won't be an end love is something you just give freely I trade everything in my life for the intimate life that I have with my wife it's that extraordinary we're not sitting here measuring what we're getting or what we're not getting you start to do that it's like the death rattle daily relationship if you want to have a great relationship the first thing you have to do is commit to a life of living in a beautiful state living in a state where you don't give away your happiness so easily most people give up away their happiness the minute somebody does something different than what they wanted them to do most people somebody didn't do what they say they're gonna do and they're pissed off it's part of life I'm not gonna sit around and suffer suffering is when you're constantly measuring what people did or didn't do or what you did or didn't do and I think if you really want to take your life to the next level you got to focus on what you're here to give instead of what you're to get it's that simple
