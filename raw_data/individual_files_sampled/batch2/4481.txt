as prosecutors promised there was no focus on Russia in their opening statements today at Paul Manafort trial but the specter of men affords deep connections to Russia and to Kremlin linked oligarchs hovered over today's proceedings mana fort was heavily in debt node millions of dollars to pro-russian interests when he landed on the Trump campaign once he became chairman of the campaign Manafort offered private briefings as Joyce just said to one of those creditors of Putin friendly oligarch Muller's prosecutors and court filings have also described mana for its Ukrainian business partner as having active ties to Russian intelligence services in fact a memo written by Rod Rosen Stein last summer and made public through court filings laid out Muller's authority to investigate whether Paul Manafort specifically committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials we also know Muller steam has questions for the President on this very subject Muller wants to ask the president what knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign including by Paul Manafort to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign last week began with the president's lawyers saying they were willing to let the president answer questions on possible collusion but not on the issue of obstruction of justice but now with the president's ex lawyer Michael Cohen reportedly alleging the president knew about the Trump Tower meeting in advance Democrats say the president may be on the hook for both there is credible evidence that the president the United States has committed obstruction of justice and possibly a conspiracy to undermine our elections and the last messaging from the president his team of lawyers there was no collusion and even if there was collusion isn't a crime but in case anyone is wondering they are now unwilling to answer questions on that topic either you said maybe you would let him answer a few limited questions on collusion but no I don't want to give them a false impression that given some of the revelations in the last three or four weeks we've been driven further away from the idea of answering any questions from them we don't think they have a legitimate investigation joining us now is Chuck Rosenberg former US attorney and senior FBI official and Jeremy bash former chief of staff at the CIA and the Department of Defense during the Obama administration thank you both for being here tonight so you have both banned the word collusion from any broadcast on which we all appear together talk about how the real sort of pot at the end of the rainbow for an investigation is a conspiracy talk to you first yeah sure I guess collusion just irks me in a khole because it's not and you're not easily act I don't tend to err Kiesel but this is sort of a made-up thing collusion means agreeing with somebody else to do something that's what a conspiracy is they're synonyms right so the fact that collusion doesn't appear in the criminal code as mr. Giuliani asserts is a other nonsense because conspiracy does and what the Mahler team is investigating is whether folks in the United States conspired with the Russians to interfere in our election call what you want when they finally charge it it's going to be charged as conspiracy the notion that collusion isn't a crime is a complete red herring it's to mislead people it's for the court of public opinion but it's not for a court of law I just want to follow up with you Chuck you just said when they finally charge it are you seeing enough pieces come to light and just what is public facing in this investigation that you believe there will be enough to charge someone with a conspiracy to coordinate or receive assistance from a hostile foreign power yeah it's an educated guess I hope it's a well educated guess yeah it's a well educated guess Nicole but yes I am there are bits and pieces in the public record that suggests that it wasn't just Russians the timing of the president's statements in Doral Florida are urging the Russians to go find the missing emails or a hack into the DNC computers all of that is tied to Russian activity that mr. Muller recently charged when he brought a case against the Russian intelligence officers so I I think there is enough I think there are other calculations that are really important here like for instance whether mr. Muller believes he has the authority to charge a sitting president some debate on that point the Department of Justice has weighed in and it weighed in on it in the past and has opined that you cannot so there's some unanswered questions but I think the pieces are there Jeremy bash I am A I have a well attuned ear to everything Chuck Rosenberg says and I have never heard him say that before so I want to ask you the same question do you see enough public facing evidence at this point to believe it make another educated guess for us that there is enough evidence now to charge someone with conspiracy to coordinate with a hostile foreign power well I don't think we know all the facts yet and I think the Muller investigation still has two ways to go to illuminate those facts but if you want to understand the way Bob Muller thinks about conspiracy all you have to do is take your dog-eared an underlying copy of the July 13th indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers on eleven counts because in there Bob Muller and his team lay out with specificity exactly what conspiracy looks like and if people want to research and use the Google machine at home to research it it's 18 USC 371 it's a conspiracy to defraud the United States and a couple of interesting things about that statute first of all it states that if two or more people agree to do something to commit an offense against the United States and one of those people actually go ahead goes ahead and does it then both people are guilty of conspiracy and shall not be imprisoned for more than five years it's a class E felony and so the important part is that if there were people inside Trump tower at the Trump Tower meeting or inside the Trump campaign or even Donald Trump himself who knew what the Russian government officers were doing and if the Russian government officers went off and did it even if they didn't come back and report it back to the Trump campaign to the Trump campaign knew about it then in effect mere knowledge establishes a conspiracy and there are other places in the Muller indictment that you if you look at paragraph 21 D in here it talks about how one of the GRU officers created spit spearfishing email attack well it's clear that all the other eleven defendants didn't know or didn't participate in that yet they were all under the indictment terms Spira tours and potentially guilty of the alleged offences and so I think you have to understand the wave Bob Muller in the special counsels office is approaching the the crime of conspiracy in order to analyze whether you think there will be a charge at the end of the day okay I love them both of you take me to law school Jeremy I'm gonna go from law school though to spy novels because I heard you say to our friend earlier today pre para that there's a 96% chance that the reason Donald Trump has taken a pro-putin position is because of money because of Long's long-standing financial ties between the Trump Organization and people around the Russian government I would ask you about that and something else you said you talked about one-on-one meetings you talked about Donald Trump clearing the room which is what we understand him to have done with Putin we looked up one of the other people and I think you made this reference to he cleared the room when he asked Jim Comey to see to it to let the investigation into Mike Flynn go how do those two hang together in your mind in terms of what a prosecutor or an investigator would be looking at right now Oh when does Donald Trump actually want to have a private conversation one does he write when he when he wants to do something where he doesn't want other people to hear what he's doing and I think one of the concerns that that I have in many national security professionals have about the one-on-one with Putin and by the way we still don't even know if the translators were in there for the entire time or if the American translator was in there for the entire time one of the problems with that is that there is no record of what was said and I think even to this day the Director of National Intelligence spoke publicly about this and even secretary Pompeo was questioned about this they have not received a full debrief of what was discussed that and it did does hearken back in my mind to the other time when Donald Trump cleared the Oval Office so he could put the arm on Jim Comey Dasom intervening in the Flint case and dropped charges which is clearly something that Bob Malloy is looking at in terms of obstruction of justice Chuck I want your thoughts on that but also if you could if I give you a two-part question here and if you could sort of weigh in on the news tonight that Bob Muller has sent more cases to the Southern District of New York but first on Jeremy's point about closed doors meeting closed-door meetings and Donald Trump's appetite for them right so I think Jeremy's spot-on the reason you throw everybody out the reason you want something you know one quote off the record is you're going to do something underhanded and it seems like a number of these conversations are underhanded I want to echo one thing Jeremy said he did a nice job explaining law of conspiracy he did that well one thing I would add it doesn't require that you succeed right you you and I could agree to rob a bank Nicole we could get Jeremy to be a part of this he goes out and buys a getaway car and then we get stopped on the way to the bank we're still guilty all three of us of conspiring to rob that bank and so when I said earlier that I think there is enough public information in the record to to see a conspiracy I don't necessarily mean that they succeeded or that everybody knew every part of the conspiracy again that's not required what's required is that folks agreed to do something that the law forbids and that somebody took a step in that direction so to me it seems to be coming together and on the question of robert muller tonight referring more cases to the Southern District these were more lobbyists doing pro Russian business in there in the Ukraine and other places right so it's sensible it's not at the core of his mandate is not at the core of the directive to him that he look at Russian interference in the election but again you have a binary choice when you're a prosecutor or an investigator and you come across criminal behavior I faced this myself in my time as a prosecutor you either do something with it or you do nothing with it and it's very hard for a prosecutor to do nothing when they come across evidence of a crime so it makes perfect sense to me that these other folks are going to get farmed out to US Attorneys offices around the country and face the consequence of their actions all right Chuck Rosenberg former US attorney and senior FBI official Jeremy bash former chief of staff and CIA in the Department of Defense taking me on a bank robbery taking me to law school I'm grateful to you both thanks for being here coming up president Trump's new best friend is reportedly still working on missiles that could reach all the way to the u.s. more
