00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,590
ground just ask my<font color="#E5E5E5"> brother's room just</font>

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,630
simply a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ship I wanted to talk about</font>

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,520
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting today and</font>

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,160
it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling good I talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,660
previously before I talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,250
tonight because I die I just have

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,539
another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those episodes i guess</font>

10
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,699
and i know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all do it doesn't matter</font>

11
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:29,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">if your spiritual if you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,970
contact with God that makes you feel

13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way if it's just chemical reactions</font>

14
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,890
or if it's dis emotion there are times

15
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,250
in life and it can happen every day once

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,920
a week and it could last for a day it

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,969
could last for a couple of minutes

18
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:46,359
seconds in which you sort of get a rush

19
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,039
in your body and you feel good about

20
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:51,100
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good maybe good just a</font>

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,550
general good<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling or maybe when it</font>

22
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,230
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me usually at feeding of</font>

23
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,960
on-site glad to be alive and it's

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">awesome and I guess the question I have</font>

25
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">for everyone is what makes you feel so</font>

26
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">good and there are different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things it</font>

27
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,710
could be being able to achieve something

28
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,210
that you thought you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could never do</font>

29
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,290
before it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be sitting just outside</font>

30
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,080
looking up at the stars concert tonight

31
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just looking around the roof</font>

32
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,909
I now have episodes<font color="#E5E5E5"> where friends around</font>

33
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,469
where if they got for a cigarette

34
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:28,469
something they're just whoops outside

35
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:33,570
and just talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> just anything and</font>

36
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,610
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like you in them and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

37
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,079
you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things that you would let</font>

38
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,140
me talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> in public website and you</font>

39
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,939
get a good feeling from opening up to

40
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,959
people perhaps you just feel good when

41
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,360
you go worships on you know my god or

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,799
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know a lot of people do that</font>

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">they go and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it or</font>

44
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,939
perhaps you feel good when you get

45
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,920
recognition for something you've done

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,110
you realize that you've actually done

47
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,729
something significant we just have a

48
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">positive effect or the effect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

49
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,539
desired and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there's also music</font>

50
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:08,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">perhaps you heard a song</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that just makes</font>

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,079
the hairs on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your neck stand</font>

52
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:13,829
up epic music which plus and your

53
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,860
emotion strings and just sounds really

54
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,019
good it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a hard</font>

55
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:22,620
guy or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know gorgeous a soppy person</font>

56
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,629
we all have songs which mean a lot to us

57
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,069
whether it relates to someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

58
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:28,829
we've lost or it relates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a situation</font>

59
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,019
we've been in but it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

60
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is in life we all have these episodes</font>

61
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,730
where we feel so so good and I could

62
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,889
name across all those categories stuff

63
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:40,440
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was to pick on one so aspects</font>

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">of what means a lot to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what makes me</font>

65
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,980
feel the most good out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

66
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,100
being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be there being less a bee</font>

67
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,200
invites for pie you know know that

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,329
Saunders wanted me to be there I could

69
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,160
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about my past but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rare thing</font>

70
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,110
else but

71
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,390
you know I've come to the point now

72
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,430
where people are starting to see maybe

73
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,670
appreciate me people want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see me and</font>

74
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I'm lighting a religious people</font>

75
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,650
that I respect people I respect the best

76
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,410
reading of the world for me is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

77
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,630
know they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much they like me or</font>

78
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,450
respect me when I hear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> from someone</font>

79
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,260
I truly respect

80
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,530
itch means the world to me it's

81
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,500
incredible<font color="#CCCCCC"> what can we explain it is</font>

82
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,050
it's a connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other night this</font>

83
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,050
is really nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here sit on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the roof</font>

84
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,010
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

85
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,760
and we'll have moments of solitude where

86
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,829
we just stare out maybe maybe it's when

87
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,170
you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sarah maybe is when you're</font>

88
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,060
walking somewhere maybe is when you're

89
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,780
driving just traveling or maybe you're

90
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,510
waking up<font color="#E5E5E5"> or going to sleep you go</font>

91
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,970
through that moment of drifting off

92
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,549
where your mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> just smiles our minds</font>

93
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:56,530
are powerful

94
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:02,000
when we feel good about something most

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,920
of the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel so glad to</font>

96
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">be alive so my question to you people is</font>
