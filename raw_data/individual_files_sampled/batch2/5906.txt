the Assad regime has a pattern of using chemical weapons get to some people against the Chemical Weapons Convention despite the fact that they had agreed to it and then despite the fact that the Russians were there guarantors so what happens next has everything to do with what the Assad regime decides to do and it has everything to do with what the russian government decides to enable as well good morning and welcome back to am joy the world is reacting this morning to airstrikes launched by the u.s. France and Britain against Syria which were intended to cripple the Bashar Assad regime's ability to produce and deploy chemical weapons at this hour the UN Security Council is set to meet at the request of Assad's patron Russia to discuss the airstrikes and late Friday Russia and the Syrian government's other prominent ally Iran warned of consequences to the military action with Iran's supreme leader going so far as to describe the attack as quote genocide but as US defense officials point out the strides were limited in scope three targets at one time over just one night but nothing could stop Donald Trump from taking a victory lap this morning tweeting the unfortunate Bushehr phrase mission accomplished but what exactly our mission was and what was accomplished remains an open question a question that could be answered potentially by NBC's bill Neely it was in Beirut Lebanon about 70 miles outside of Damascus so bill on the ground there what do people feel was either accomplished or was the point well as you say were not very far from Damascus here the church bells are ringing in Beirut at the end of a quite extraordinary day and there were protests to answer your question earlier on on the streets of Damascus people obviously in the heartland of President Assad not happy with this he was pictured at nine o'clock this morning walking nonchalantly into his office almost literally taking it in his stride signaling to the world that these airstrikes didn't make him lose sleep but I think he heard them and I think the message from the Pentagon today joy was that he did get the message an extraordinary extraordinarily detailed briefing from the Pentagon this afternoon about those strikes in which they said that they were precise overwhelming and effective they told us what they were which was to cripple Syria's ability to launch chemical weapons in the future and what they were not this wasn't attempt we unattempted we were told to depose the Syrian regime but in brief joy 105 missiles 76 directed at one facility the bars a military facility I'd been there it's a scientific research missile facility it does not exist anymore said general Frank McKenzie two other sites hit in Homs one with 22 missiles another with seven missiles and the key thing was it was double the number of missiles la in last year's strike and of course this was a multinational operation British and French warplanes and a French warship also involved but what was extraordinary was what general McKenzie went through that this was almost in his words a complete success none of the Allied aircraft were successfully engaged Russian air defenses were not employed he said we're confident that all our missiles reach their target 40 Syrian surface-to-air missiles were fired he said but they were largely ineffective no missile was shot done there was no agreement with the Russians beforehand and the Russians did not engage I suppose joy the interesting thing was what he he didn't say that was toward the end of the briefing you know he said the Syrian chemical weapons Network is larger than the three places targeted we took out at the heart of it he said but he did imply that there were more chemical weapons of one description or another still left in Syria and he didn't spell out what the redline might be in the future he said we're prepared to take more action but - what is that red line is it sarin gas or has it you know gone to the still deadly but more common chlorine gas so in other words if if Bashar al-assad launches another attack what are we what does the US do next do we simply go straight away and press the button for another wave of air strikes but he did say we're ready for it we're ready for anything this was a very clear message said the Pentagon's spokeswoman last night and we hope that Bashar al-assad heard it joy all right thank you very much very comprehensive report NBC's bill Neely very much thank you back with me Ayman Moines D an MSNBC anchor Cal Perry NBC News global editor nayara hawk former State Department State Department senior adviser Malcom Nance executive director of the terrorist metrics project a man I'll start with you what I didn't hear in that attacked in two cities Homs and in damasc near Damascus a facility that seems to be in a research facility 29 bombs dropped on another facility I didn't hear were attacks on any personal assets related to Bashar al-assad the dictator of Syria or attacks on the Syrian military yeah this was if you had to look at a spectrum of possible options presented to the president and a lot of analysts who've been following this and tracking this over the last several weeks would probably say this falls on the end of the spectrum that would be classified as a very limited operation if you wanted to go to the opposite end of the spectrum let's say if you wanted to go where John Bolton perhaps wanted the president to go it would have involved strikes on the regime's capability to deliver those weapons which would have been fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters or airports it could have gone on the command and control structure of the defense establishment the security establishment headquarters barracks things like that could have even gone after the presidential palace to really disrupt the President of Syria's ability to still kind of keep the country and keep the command and control of his military cohesively together any chance of doing that you could have gone after the port in Latakia as well but that falls on the very serious end of the spectrum which I don't think this president from the Twitter that he had been suggesting from the politics of what he's facing here domestically from the international community's willingness to get involved and miR down in that kind of conflict I don't think the president was anywhere near that part of the spectrum so what we saw three strikes very limited or three targets I should say very limited in scope and the the Pentagon this probably has a little bit more wishful thinking that this is gonna work as a deterrent last year when they went after one strike it did not deter President Assad and let's keep in mind that although we are now involved in a military strike April of 2018 I believe there have been nine other chemical weapons attacks over the course of the past 12 months yeah that went without any kind of response from the United States militarily yeah I mean we have the August 2013 attack on rebels in a city called Goethe we have an April 4th 2017 attack we have an April 6th attack so there been multiple attacks and we haven't responded to each of them so then you know that a Cal I'm struck by that imagery by our bill neely of the dictator of Syria the president of Syria Bashar al-assad just roll it out and saying this did nothing to me I don't understand what message was even said in the region where the idea is you're supposed to scare him straight right I wonder if we did that or did we just give him make him more defiant and by the way if we did what amy was just talking about you risk a conflict with Iran and Russia which clearly United doesn't right so on the one side as a masane you either risk a conflict widening right but on the flip side now you've given the Syrian president and the Syrian government the leeway to come out today and say we were victorious we were able to stop this strike and and and push forward that propaganda campaign the contradictions here right are incredible president Trump wants us out of Syria yet 150 some odd missiles right he wants to help the people of Syria yet only 11 Syrians have been led into the United States this year so we're running like a 15 to 1 missile to refugee ratio 500,000 Syrian civilians killed half a million people where have we been the last seven years if we really care about the Syrian people this is what the Arab world is saying this morning and the Arab world is is very politically astute they're gonna be saying this is a president who's under serious domestic political challenges and is wagging the dog yeah and the the reality is not who I'm old enough to remember when an American president made a really sort of heart-wrenching case for attacking another bath bath as dictatorship in the region like right next door by saying that you know the then dictator of Iraq was killing and gassing children that we had to go in there for humanitarian reasons that didn't end well a Donald Trump was actually declared himself for invading Iraq and then turned against it ran on this idea that he wouldn't get us into that sort of land war debacle but here we find ourselves is there a rational military explanation or intelligence explanation for doing what we did yesterday if we've already stated that the goal is not to change the regime Malcolm oh okay well you know I was so stunned by that question that I couldn't speak no there there is no rational reason for that because there's no strategy strategy involves long-term planning so that when you do something you understand the consequences of what was done and then what you have to do is manage those consequences we are not doing that what we are doing is flailing about and as much as I like carrying out an airstrike against people that really deserve it that's precisely what we have here we went out we struck the organizational infrastructure of the chemical weapons but we did nothing to present a threat to the regime itself excuse me no no worries I know you were up all night because we had you essentially captive it all night you know now you're I want to talk about the the sort of diplomatic issue here because with Iraq what you had was a very a struggle with the bush administration with the George W Bush administration to create an international coalition in a consensus that we even ought to attack that country and I remember France being on the other side of that issue hence freedom fries and other attacks on France as an entity and Britain going along with us sort of always riding alongside whenever we'd want to attack countries in that region but I wonder if this time what's missing is any sort of diplomatic effort to isolate Bashar al-assad the way for instance we isolate North Korea is he a rogue regime being treated by the rest of the world in that way I mean this is a country that wants to isolate Iran we want isolate North Korea you know what can the international community do diplomatically about Assad let me just wipe out shopping in Paris as last time I checked sure I mean Assad is defiant and he has been for the last seven years which is especially horrific knowing that he's actually a doctor by training yet he decides that he needs to be killing children in his own country he is backed by some serious powers unlike North Korea right so it really requires as Donald Trump for the first time in this entire war mentioned directly that Iran and Russia are the ones backing up the Assad regime but these are just moments in which he decides that he wants to appeal to some common sense ability versus anything as malcolm and others we've all mentioned any long term strategy right the it took a year for Donald Trump to implement the sanctions that Congress had put on Russia for interfering in our election what is he actually going to do to get to the heart of Assad's power and that is the Russia Russian regime additional sanctions is he going to take Putin on directly I mean unfortunately by not intervening directly after a chemical attack that first time around last year it was fancy fireworks then it's fancy fireworks now where he signals like crazy what he's gonna do so everybody pulls out we bomb empty buildings it's not the true deterrent that you would hope for to give Assad so it ends up being a tit-for-tat in which he gets to show something to his base or people in the United States who want to feel good about humanitarian intervention without any of the actual practical steps of following up against Russia or any of the humanitarian steps of letting in refugees this is the the additional challenge we have that if he's not going to take on Russia he's not really making a case to the American public either it was just what you need to do in a wag the dog scenario there is no long-term plan for selling the American public on why we should be interfering in in Syria so again it just ends up being a a temporary momentary distraction which is ultimately what all of his tweets are they are temporary distractions they are not policy statements or policy deliverables and when you're so loose with the truth as the US president as he is on Twitter and you're so bombastic you open the door for the Russians to say whatever they want because nothing really matters and it's all noise so the Russians said the Syrians were behind the chemical attack the rebels they set it up the Russians said oh this exerci in in the UK who was poison oh it was the Brits it was all a staged event it creates so much noise and at the end of the day today the Russian military is more entrenched and they've just said to the world we can stay here inward deterrence to the United States really quickly Malcolm before I come back to the table Bashar al-assad is backed by two regimes that we are supposedly sanctioning Russia which Donald Trump keeps reluctantly sanctioning which he finally said something negative about and Iran which Donald Trump claims wants to tear up an agreement to stop them building nuclear weapons I don't understand why it is so complicated if these are two countries the world already seems prone to isolate to isolate them all yeah well you know this is a question of will also I mean Iran and Russia right now in Syria take a look at this they are creating an axis where they have Russia has extended Iran's influence all the way up to the Israeli border has given them the ability to expand their ground forces Armed Forces combat capability in Syria to keep that regime in place to further Russia's Russia's goals in doing that none of the sanctions that we're implementing which are generally personal are impacting struck Russia is more than willing to wink and nod at the at the arms regime that we put in place for the weapon you know controlling Iranians weapons program but they are selling things to them and what they're selling first is weapons and selling those weapons we are now giving ourselves we are giving Iran and Russia everything that they've ever yesterday I wouldn't worry as much about a conventional response from Russia like a missile tit-for-tat as much as using their new tool of disinformation yeah and that's where it right we're going to try to continue to destabilize democracies outside of Syria right in the West and in the United States look look if you put them back back back up please okay because a man died we already essentially handed Iran Iraq right we went in and invaded Iraq and handed it over to the you know more pros Shiite government which then is friendly with Iran now we have Syria which is essentially in under the control of Iran and Russia and then Trump has been empowering Russia from the minute he became president of the United States do we even have any significant influence and that reads anymore or have we essentially now ceded it to Russia and Iran I think if you were to look at where the United States has influence its pockets in the region among some Gulf Arab countries perhaps more so than anywhere else you have certainly influence with Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates but let's be clear they don't necessarily have influence enough to change Saudi Arabia's policies on issues like Yemen and elsewhere so I'm not sure that the United States has the kind of influence that at once used to have what we've seen masterfully from the Iranians is they've exploited all of the American missteps in the region you look at for example the Iraq war you mentioned that was one this Syria where that's another but look it even more recently the GCC conflict you've got the United States embroiled in this tension between Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates and Qatar and what has happened Iran has gotten closer and one of the closest GCC countries that the United States used to be close with with his cuts are why because President Trump by some accounts through cuts are under the bus early on in this in this dispute if you will and so Iran has gotten closer to Qatar and once again it is exploiting the vulnerabilities of the United States as missteps and I think that's that's a sign that the United States has not had a clear strategy in the region that that it to be honest predates President Trump but has gotten worse since presidential it's gotten worse since President Donald Trump and mr. tough guy just had cutters Amir right sitting in the White House had nothing was wrong nothing was wrong having changed nothing having changed nothing about his relationship with Iran still pals with Iran back in the why I would love to know why and I'd also still like to know where Jared Kushner got that 1.2 yeah dollars for six weeks six Fifth Avenue I'm gonna keep asking that question because I'm curious curiosity Amon one team Calipari now you're a hawk Malcolm dance Malcolm get some sleep coming up the imperial power of the American President sees necks hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date
