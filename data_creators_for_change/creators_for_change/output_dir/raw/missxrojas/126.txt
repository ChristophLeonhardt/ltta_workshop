00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,150
hello so it's what is it 517 p.m. 17<font color="#CCCCCC"> 17</font>

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,710
as we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing that's been on my</font>

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,450
mind a lot today it's how we change our

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,040
behavior in accordance with vlogging I

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,450
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about my friend Adrienne's</font>

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,950
blog member I think I've mentioned it

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,210
before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but for those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you who</font>

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,379
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen it you have to check about</font>

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,060
a pen link to it in the description bar

10
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,470
below but yes have you even seen in

11
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,660
myself my behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of changed and</font>

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,699
I've had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be sort of thoughtful then</font>

13
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,619
sort of prepared in ways for what I'm

14
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:26,970
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or I'm</font>

15
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about your commands or I'm</font>

16
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,390
spending actually quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day</font>

17
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,070
that the hours of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day just think</font>

18
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,899
about the videos that gone up the videos

19
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will go up and how does that affect</font>

20
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,710
the way that we behave especially when

21
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,540
we're documenting a lot of our personal

22
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,129
life another<font color="#E5E5E5"> video that I really loved</font>

23
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,930
it sort of touched on this was in Greece

24
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,430
video but why she's not doing vlogmas

25
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,050
this year I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be wrong in saying</font>

26
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,640
this they didn't punish me if<font color="#CCCCCC"> not but as</font>

27
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,930
far as i recall i thinkI rid was a

28
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,399
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> who kind of came up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with vogue</font>

29
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,140
mess and started<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing book was very</font>

30
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,520
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> early on and she was talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

31
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">how for her it kind of affected her in a</font>

32
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,149
personal way and it just isn't the right

33
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,370
fit for her anymore if I were having a

34
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,320
more social month like if I were in

35
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,120
London for this month I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

36
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,188
would change the dynamic of this a lot

37
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and last I won't end of log most of the</font>

38
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,330
Express plan of making videos rather

39
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,890
than necessarily vlogs because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

40
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,110
if i had made blogs of my life in London

41
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,180
it it would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> little before back and</font>

42
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,380
I'm not saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that other people who do</font>

43
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,270
it's a fullback I walked a lot of luck

44
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,189
miss videos some people do tremendously

45
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,470
I'm just saying for me it would become

46
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,570
something different I don't know why

47
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is a part of its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that for me</font>

48
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,229
blogging is quite intimate blogging at

49
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,850
this time<font color="#CCCCCC"> of year is quite intimate and</font>

50
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,229
this whole experience has been quite

51
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:32,430
intimate because I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading all</font>

52
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,380
your comments and I've been engaged in

53
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">this bigger conversation with you but</font>

54
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,920
it's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have a job and I get up</font>

55
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,450
and I go to work and come back and do

56
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,770
this and it's still fun and different

57
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,350
and interesting to me and I wonder

58
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,229
whether if my social life for my job<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

59
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,659
they were blurring there I think it

60
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,520
would get kind of confusing and also

61
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,979
kind of draining in lots of ways unless

62
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do it correctly and there are many</font>

63
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,280
people who have done it correctly and

64
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,079
also you've all and i think the youtube

65
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,430
community as a whole has been

66
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,049
tremendously understanding of you only

67
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,719
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my day or you only see</font>

68
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,790
20 minutes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my day it's not a master</font>

69
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,050
of everyone going in with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the expert</font>

70
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,400
tation that you're sitting their entire

71
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,050
life at least not anymore i think that

72
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,100
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of a better</font>

73
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,720
conversation around that and you've

74
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,760
always been really understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

75
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,800
expressly so but it is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

76
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,090
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> still because at the end of the</font>

77
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,680
day does go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that identity thing</font>

78
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,090
you are presenting yourself online

79
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,920
you're presenting something of your life

80
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,460
online presenting sort of 10 minutes of

81
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,470
yourself and that's a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

82
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,830
minutes is a it's a you know it's a

83
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">sizable chunk of your day which is why I</font>

84
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate you watching you've decided</font>

85
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give me 10 minutes for your time and</font>

86
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,690
it is my responsibility to do something

87
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,240
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it whether that's showing you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

88
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,830
my life and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being kind of like a</font>

89
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,960
comfortable environment in which you can

90
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend time kind of in someone else's</font>

91
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,070
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

92
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,080
watch things like Brooke most I saw put

93
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,910
it on in the background while I'm doing

94
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,320
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and then there are people</font>

95
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,700
who do different things with it like my

96
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,860
friend Marion who is so tired to do such

97
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,540
fantastic editor and she's essentially

98
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,430
making lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of little short films with</font>

99
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,530
her blog posts and I just couldn't

100
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend it enough it is absolutely</font>

101
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">beautiful but yes for me in some ways it</font>

102
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,690
does feel a bit like a school project

103
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,950
that we've all been given<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

104
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,270
project and then we're bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in</font>

105
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,500
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of term and showing each</font>

106
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">other and seeing the different ways</font>

107
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,680
we've interpreted things like an essay

108
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,270
you get given<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question when</font>

109
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,470
people come at it from completely

110
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,150
different angles and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes maybe there a</font>

111
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,739
formula ways to do it but even when

112
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">people follow the formula they often</font>

113
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,370
have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra to add to it for me</font>

114
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,680
I forgetting<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of matter</font>

115
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,880
critical mindset the other thing I'll

116
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,900
say is that it's been so enjoyable

117
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,239
vlogging<font color="#CCCCCC"> every day and so as I said it</font>

118
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,430
initially making myself make things

119
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,959
without worrying too much about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

120
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,610
without overthinking it just having the

121
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,170
idea and making it rather than having

122
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,239
the idea and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> making it and then</font>

123
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,890
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> six months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down the line about</font>

124
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,390
how much I wanted to make it but didn't

125
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,130
have the time just actually doing in the

126
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,840
moment it's been a great format to do it

127
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,690
and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something and permissive</font>

128
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,010
about this because you know i'm

129
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,020
uploading every day so I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

130
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,730
there's less of a burden to make it

131
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,590
tight in the way that I can never really

132
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,870
achieve anyway which is fine I never

133
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">really intended to but it's yeah I</font>

134
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,510
didn't know there's something like

135
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,090
permission grunting about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this format in</font>

136
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,769
as much as I have a door doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there</font>

137
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,860
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment between finishing recording</font>

138
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,630
for the day sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and having</font>

139
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,230
maybe a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 minute to an hour to</font>

140
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,089
period in which I'm just thinking I

141
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:21,490
didn't record enough today I didn't say

142
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,140
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> good today I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to upload</font>

143
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,610
a rubbish video and I'm not gonna have

144
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,500
any more ideas and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all just gets so</font>

145
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,540
dramatic but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

146
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,060
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> revisit certain parts of my day</font>

147
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,920
that I've forgotten about and certain

148
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,690
thought processes that I've forgotten

149
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,610
about and ways of phrasing things and

150
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,870
thinking things and things you've said

151
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,790
and things I've just come in and out my

152
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,040
Dane and that my life that for me is one

153
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the treasures of having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years of</font>

154
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">my life almost almost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

155
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,660
life parts of it 10 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font>

156
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,030
different presentations of it different

157
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,800
interpretations of the school<font color="#CCCCCC"> project of</font>

158
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,200
it on the internet because it's a time

159
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,150
machine so many of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends are</font>

160
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,700
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube and they have around</font>

161
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,710
that amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time on YouTube</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too and</font>

162
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,540
it's a time machine for them and it's

163
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,160
time machine for me and the thing I love

164
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,720
when I discovering new youtuber whether

165
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,520
they've been making videos for two

166
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,910
months or seven eight nine ten<font color="#CCCCCC"> years is</font>

167
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,980
having that sort of wealth rich

168
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,180
backstory it doesn't feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I have</font>

169
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,400
so much catch up one it's this is really

170
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,690
exciting because there are a lot of

171
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,880
these different moments available that I

172
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,670
can watch I can understand something

173
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,710
about some kind of growth through that I

174
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,510
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's necessarily linear</font>

175
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,280
but there is growth there and there has

176
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,990
changed that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's exciting I</font>

177
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,160
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of easy to think that</font>

178
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,110
like YouTube's greatest days are gone

179
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,200
and I've been guilty of thinking that in

180
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,320
saying that sometimes but it's not it's

181
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">still bad even when the cameras look</font>

182
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,630
away it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to put</font>

183
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">more energy into the things we love and</font>

184
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,760
have tighter communities within this

185
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,800
universe of YouTube now look mrs. made

186
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,900
me very excited by YouTube now the light

187
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,970
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting worse and worse because</font>

188
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,760
the Sun is going down at 5pm but I'm

189
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,780
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some food and in the</font>

190
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,460
process think more about all of this and

191
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,230
maybe I'll regroup with you in a little

192
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,580
bit so in the time since you and I last

193
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,650
spoke I managed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spill food all down</font>

194
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,330
my shirt and had to change and also

195
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,560
caught up with a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> friends from home</font>

196
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,300
this is the perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that I often</font>

197
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,190
speak to so many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friends and</font>

198
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,230
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do facetime audio because it</font>

199
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,880
nice to like just focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> on one person</font>

200
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,950
but more for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> knot I have like all</font>

201
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,330
these different little chat windows open

202
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,590
and I catch up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with everyone at once</font>

203
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,610
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out as much information</font>

204
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,680
as I can well like it went to get to a

205
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,630
lover and when at 6pm hear that my start

206
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,220
feeling bad about keeping them up but I

207
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,210
was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I know it's not</font>

208
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,730
December 21st so this kind of emotion

209
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,170
might be a little bit premature but I

210
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,520
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how proudly I'm with</font>

211
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,750
all of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not</font>

212
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,600
something that I say to them enough I

213
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,430
don't think like I I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> very excited</font>

214
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,630
about the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're doing but</font>

215
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,440
I do genuinely feel really proud of

216
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,430
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much everyone I've come into</font>

217
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,200
contact with this year 2015 has been a

218
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,700
really tough year for many of my friends

219
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,230
whether that's like personally

220
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,470
financially family issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> mental health</font>

221
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,350
issues all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things but</font>

222
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,570
it's also been a fantastic year for them

223
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,630
creatively and career-wise they've all

224
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,570
just been incredible really have in

225
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,070
their personal achievements and as

226
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,250
friends and as individuals and as role

227
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,410
models for me and as people I can go to

228
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,810
for advice and as people that I can go

229
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,000
to with a ridiculous thing that's on the

230
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,010
internet that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am laughing myself silly</font>

231
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">about I'm not even to mention the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font>

232
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,860
that so many of them have been

233
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely fantastic since I moved</font>

234
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,820
knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was moving by myself and</font>

235
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,710
like was feeling a bit you know iffy

236
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,360
about some points<font color="#E5E5E5"> really excited but</font>

237
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,680
also elected me know what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

238
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,010
myself into they were very just kind and

239
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,080
generous and still have been and

240
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,650
checking in and I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just offering</font>

241
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,480
that point of contact that that just

242
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,400
means a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more so yes I'm really proud</font>

243
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,440
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also incredibly grateful for</font>

244
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,150
them different sort of frames of mind as

245
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,860
well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's something that has</font>

246
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">really come through in 2015 that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

247
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,590
are sort of inhabiting these different

248
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,910
perspectives and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> regrouping</font>

249
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,440
and showering them rather than

250
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,360
necessarily everyone being on the same

251
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,730
wavelength all the time it's not really

252
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,680
even about wavelength it just is<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

253
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,440
different points of view and in a way

254
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,990
videos ooh fantastic be supportive and

255
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,060
