55
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,010
waiting for Star Wars I couldn't help

56
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> queueing I've</font>

done for things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I adore the harry</font>

58
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,220
potter for the killers for many

59
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,070
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things films and books music</font>

60
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,810
and events<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just that excitement that</font>

61
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,609
anticipation that thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would get</font>

62
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:53,079
you out there in the worst possible

63
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,590
whether in freezing cold weather for

64
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,200
star wars in torrential rain for harry

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,549
potter and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deathly hallows in</font>

66
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,650
torrential rain for any of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> films</font>

67
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,170
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Leicester Square</font>

68
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,770
has were met with just rain and rain and

69
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,690
rain<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember like it was inevitable</font>

70
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,520
that whatever day it was it would be

71
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,319
raining heavily but it's just because

72
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,970
there's so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> joy in the waiting and</font>

73
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,770
as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you're eager for that time to</font>

74
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,060
come the first second whatever you're

75
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,600
waiting for begins you lose something in

76
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,670
a way I know that you lose it maybe

77
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,959
that's not the right word something's

78
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,660
changed chemically in the world and

79
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,900
there won't be another point in time

80
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,010
where you've never seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> film again</font>

81
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,110
or never watch that episode or never

82
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,970
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> that first word of that book you</font>

83
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,660
can't say I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> read that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> book yet</font>

84
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,799
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have read it where you</font>

85
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,280
would have begun it it's just it's funny

86
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,130
to me how when waiting to gain something

87
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,610
it can become a loss quite quickly

88
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,280
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you lose that almost potential</font>

89
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,489
energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think would be a really</font>

90
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,860
non-scientific fo science understanding

91
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,720
of it but you do you lose a potential

92
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
energy at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time you crave it and</font>

93
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,500
you need it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need it with every</font>

94
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,209
five of your being and especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

95
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,190
it turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> well it's so exciting</font>

96
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,930
because you may have lost the

97
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,560
anticipation<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may have lost the fever</font>

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,660
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to have this thing is in the</font>
