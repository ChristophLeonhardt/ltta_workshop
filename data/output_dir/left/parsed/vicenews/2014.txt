Yemen's besieged southern city of Aden
ships entering its port have previously
been fired upon by hootie rebels meaning
few vessels are prepared to make the
trip and almost no foreign journalists
have found their way into the city
no Kuni devaglia

fortunately the firing subsided in a
small boat came out to take vice news
and our fellow passengers off the ship
and into Aden we were now entering a
frontline of Yemen's Civil War under
siege from all sides Aden is a
stronghold of resistance against the
Iranian backed hootie rebels allied with
army units loyal to former President
Saleh house to join the Arab Spring the
Hutus and their allies forced out the
government in March and now control
large areas of the country including the
capital sana with president Hadi forced
into exile a coalition led by Saudi
Arabia has been waging a bombing
campaign to force the Hootie's out of
the former government's territory
upon entering the city we could see a
large cloud of smoke overhead we headed
towards its source

and
you
the conflict in Yemen has been
characterized by some as a new frontline
in the struggle between Sunni and Shia
Islam as the Hootie's are predominately
Shiite and the South predominantly Sunni
but for many Yemenis their grievances
are due to a historic division north and
southern Yemen were only unified in 1990
with a civil war breaking out in 1994
and weak governance in a poor economy
has led groups in both the South and the
north to feel marginalized and to seek
autonomy to find out more about what
those resisting the Hootie's in Aden
were fighting for we went to meet Ali
Seidel a phony a spokesman for the
southern popular resistance movement the
group leading the fight back against the
Hootie's how come Neffe have accidently

all over me full of Anna's oh yeah
alia I don't know the bathroom hit the a
program demeanor at that point the unit
decided to move forward so they could
fire upon the who t positions
abdul khader had been wounded in the
foot
a group of hootie soldiers had flanked
our position
the unit kept firing despite little
effect which in turn brought in heavier
fire from the Hootie's forcing the unit
to shelter against the side of a
building
after number of hours pinned down by who
to fire backup arrived in the form of an
armored vehicle which began firing on
the hootie positions
this gave the unit enough time to
retreat by this point three men have
been wounded including applecart second
arms the 11th
something
the wounded were taken to the nearest
hospital a facility run by medicines
enfant EA or Doctors Without Borders
I'm with
and having that
Abdelkader was then taken through for
surgery on his foot although due to
overcrowding he wasn't going into an
operating theatre but award with other
patients yesterday we received lot of

was not unconscious as the surgeon began
the operation as you see here the should

this is a module
oh brother
we claim and we divide the legalized
issues and an advisor to
favors Abdelkader swooned wasn't too
serious but in every corner of this
overcrowded hospital there were more
casualties from the war
by the one I had mother
the little boy
or as difficult to say
to say
patient is a patient so
tensor that person
the front line is 400 meters away from
the hospital so that means that received
a lot of wounded people every day
we have surgeons from New Zealand
Australia Poland there is a high
rotation in the medical teams because
the work is very intensive and it's
usually they they work only one month
because it's too too tiring
we have an average of 350 wounded per
week but sometimes it peaks at 50
patients per day who these forces
control the access of Adam which makes
the supplies very difficult to to take
in the most terrible thing is that
nobody knows how it's going to end there
is no understanding of what the future
