LOOK HOW DIFFERENT OUR SHOW IS.

191
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:31,616
THERE IS NOT "TRUMP IS GREAT,"

192
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:34,252
"OBAMA IS BAD."

193
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,421
"BUSH IS FANTASTIC."

194
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,223
WE SWITCH GEARS.

195
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:39,624
45 MINUTES ABOUT BAD TRUMPETERS

196
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:41,993
IN 15 MINUTES ON HOW THEY WISH

197
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:42,827
OPRAH WAS PRESIDENT.

198
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:45,663
SHOWS A PROGRAM, IF YOU WATCH

199
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:47,065
HERE, PEOPLE ARE HAPPIER.

200
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:49,400
I WOULD LIKE CNN DO A STUDY ON

201
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,435
WHY FOX VIEWERS ARE HAPPIER.

202
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:52,403
WE HAVE A DIVERSITY OF VIEWS AND

203
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:54,205
ALLOWS YOU TO GET INFORMATION

204
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:59,210
AND FORM YOUR OWN OPINION.

205
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,379
>> Greg: WHEN YOU FEEL BAD

206
00:06:01,379 --> 00:00:00,000
WATCHING THE NEWS.
