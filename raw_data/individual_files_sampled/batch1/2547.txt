everyone thanks for joining us for business insider live i'm alex and i am so happy you're with us today because we are teaming up with guinness world records and the sort tacular team they're an international group of acrobatics and circus performers and they are attempting to break the Guinness world record for the most hand spins on the spanish webs in 30 seconds who's excited they are from the SAR tacular and tell us a little bit about what do you feel today are you um yeah very excited actually yeah yeah this is gonna be a great attempt I'm not sure we slept either one of us level LS there it's gonna it's gonna be great regardless we're gonna do this and can you tell us a little bit about your experience your background how you've trained for this as well yeah you want to take this one area basically our training has been over the past decade plus we both had careers prior to joining powers and becoming man tricks which then became Tsar tacular so really our experiences our training and performance background prior and over the past decade right this particular skill of course that we can't train it to a world record speed every time what we're going to be doing is we're gonna be flying around I'm gonna like look like a human flag getting spun on this rope but when I'm holding on with sheer strength and he's putting in all sorts of power into this rogue system to get the speed going we can't train it like that all the time because it completely wrecks us for our performances which is what we need to do so the truth is we only train this once in a great while so today when when we do it it's going to be a great feat and something that doesn't happen often on this once in a lifetime so now do you shrink like what's your training routine like and your first purchase have a lot of her body strength yeah absolutely so we both trained a lot Erin trains more than I do you motivate each other how did between we perform of quite often so in between performing we get in as much training time with the company with individual partners and with each other as we can basically less training now and more actually just rehearsals for shows we do over 200 shows a year so that is what keeps us bit and we because what we're doing is sort of on the extreme edges and capability we have to save our energy reserves or the actual performance so we spend our time in rehearsals for those performances and that is our training of course we do warm-ups and everything or an and we do go to the gym and yeah but mostly we're learning all of our different acrobatic partners rhythms they become our human barbells and dumbbells so to speak I'm definitely that works wow so what are some of the events that you could see during your performances so aside from what your errand I have different skills I mean the range of performances is its tremendous it can be anywhere from the prince or prime minister of a country to cancer camp for children to burlesque and little clubs in the city so the range is tremendous it goes it runs the gamut we really perform all over the place sometimes crowds for tens and tens of thousands or other times very small private parties so it keeps it really interesting we never know what we're going to get whether it's a stadium full of people or a small private party somewhere we also get to go all over which is pretty cool we've been in 70 countries at this point which which is it's a nice way to travel the world that's for sure and get to meet cool and interesting people all over the place and then in terms of our skill sets Aaron does a lot of different circuits apparatuses we're both multi talented performers we both do multiple aerial apparatus is as well as multiple ground ground skills based on the theaters or where we are sometimes we have very little space so we have to go to all ground stuff so we have a lot of skills Aaron does Cyr wheel which is a really cool apparatus it's a spinning wheel as well as we both do bullwhip which of course everybody recognizes from the Ringmaster's and all of the circus is all over the place we do ground acrobatics and body balancing and hand-to-hand where we balance each other in positions and like he said Ariel is what we're most known for we have a couple other specialties skills that are pretty cool that they'll just happen from live shows to find out those have to come so for those of you just joining us now we teamed up with guinness world records and the cirque tacular team today because we are attempting to be the most of our hand spins the world record for the most number of hands in on a Spanish web in 30 seconds now happy by during rehearsals or hide so here's the thing we've tied it okay we've tied and how many is that for our dog so it's the current record is 52 which is legitimately really really really really really hard and we have tied that in record in rehearsals so today's the day we're going to break it to all right so we'll let you guys kind of hang out for a second we're going to talk to Michael over here he's going to be our judge for today how are you drove backwards how are you thinking I'm so excited to be oh I'm so excited do I feel like I want to be the one that gets up there like I'm fine right here Counting so you must witness oh I mean so many different attempts that people are trying for absolutely but this is so exciting because it's one of those classic circus thing that everyone recognizes but it's incredibly hard to break this record also current record 52 spins and that was set by Rebecca and Donovan from the UK and USA in August of 2015 that's crazy they have broken this record multiple times ticking up every time 52 so now if Chad and Erin if they tie today are they considered like a record holder there's any better so if someone ties the number they officially tie the record so they are cold record orders there's still members of the Guinness World Records family I would love to see them break the right way to I think so arguing so can you walk us through the protocol like the process Aleut Lee so they'll have 30 seconds that's 30 seconds of me counting have 10 seconds to build up to speed dad's going to give me a verbal go that is when the time will start so as long as they don't go over that 10 seconds it will be a valid attempt so he'll probably take five to six seconds to get up to speed give me the start then I'll start counting they'll have 30 seconds I will count it down and that will give us the results depending on how the attempt goes I may have to go and check the slo-mo video just to make sure we got every spin accurately but it should be clean attempt oh really 310 they could break it on the first attempt I hope they break it on the first night breaking on the first attempt also do I think so too so now dad how high up are you actually going to be good so this is an 8 meter rope ok I'll be up there holding on we do have a safety loop on there but truthfully I'm holding on with sheer strength and especially at this speed errands going to be putting the power into the system to create the speed and my job is just to hold on real tight breathe not pass out not have any like interesting moments take the time to get in between to recover and yeah catch your breath I mean like I said I got a movie to catch to meet the CM wants to catch that movie so we're gonna do it anything back so we got it ok you're gonna be up on the Spanish web and then and you're going to be on the ground type type brick right yeah performance injuries right here from the attempts this is this is no joke but the pain we go through to make this happen was there is little stuff they've torn well we're really excited and for those of you just joining us now this is the circular team and they are attempting to break the Guinness world record for the most hand spins on a Spanish web in 30 seconds e of three attempts maybe they'll breakdown the first we hope so I have a lot of confidence that they would be the corrector of 50 to 250 to hand since all right ah who's ready are we ready ready all right all right go five seconds 20 seconds left 15 seconds left ten seconds left 5 4 3 2 1 we're going to go to the video we're going to go for a video alright so they're going to go check the video how to cover a little bit a little bit of a breather I'm gonna bring Susie over come on over Suzie she's with half owner yeah that was amazing yeah I was gonna say what are you I'm really impressed it's hard to impress me that impressive it's pretty impressive they're great practitioners and they work really hard and they cross train they do all different sorts of apparatus and they're amazing amazing beautiful that was beautiful are you a former acrobat or I thought it was a dancer by profession and I did a lot of broadway and I can't a flyer very late in the game offense fire but I think I started too late no I'm sure too late i started i started too late to be as good as i would like to be so i'm still working on it you were watching do you think that they broke the record he were you counting counting i was actually looking at the forum valley she's like oh that's my god I was I was admiring that yeah I did not count I don't even count on that damn but it was beautiful look there's got so much activity going on during the day and so many different acrobats and performers butts like exciting energy is that you get to witness every day it's very exciting it's a great place to work that's a great place to pay out I'm grateful every day this is what I do have anyone else have to try and try to feminize I've we have some record holders already here Oh what we have some weave from time to time had people who've done record-breaking feats on the flying trapeze Oh they've had people who done you know like we had the first guy to do a three hour somersault has been here has taught here Toby steel we've had people who Miguel Casarez who's the only one to do a triple somersault and the triple and a half out back-to-back and a show I think that's a world record I'm not an expert on that but I think now that you've brought the subject up we're gonna be looking well computer for you to know you love absolute let me in here except they don't win anything attempt like this I mean incredible thank you so much for coming it looks like they're having it gets get a shot of the whole facility is pretty neat pattern airing today so so again we kind of as a professional how much work i mean just years of training and and and artwork goes into just that what we just saw is like the culmination of how many years and how much training its most people when they come to the warehouse already have a gymnastic background their allure gymnast or they trained in ballet um so they start with that 810 years of solid training and then they work on ax which also takes quite a long time so depends on the skill I mean I'm every once in a while when I'm teaching I have to turn to my students and say I've been dancing and training for 47 years is that that's really yeah so don't do the math on how old I am really 29 um this stuff keeps you young by the way yeah I'm gonna say yeah yeah I mean this is I think I maybe I i think i'm not the only one but i did gymnastics as a kid i think a lot of kids did gymnastics when they're growing up coming back here was kind of like trip down memory lane a little bit yeah yeah that's some i think this is a lot of childhood fantasies have to do with and this kind of movement and spinning and that's true happiness yes Lloyd I did not make that no but it also has to be rewarding to see how the performers come in they're still set and then how much they kind of grow for sure these had an errand actually we did not train them but they're professionals who come in and train with us which makes us feel happy and look good and it employs us and they have their own production company and they hire professionals out of the warehouse and people out of my professional programs so I feel really happy they're lovely and talented so outside someone just chiming in the comments they think that they at least tied the record thank you someone in the comments said that they wish they have during rehearsals and I think that I have a good feeling that they at least hi but i also think they're going to be in today I do I do well it's the kind of thing you can't you know you can't just put any lips you know one thing enormous athletic skill but the form that they have and the way he holds himself that's learned and that's long time that that takes nuts down a background that's everything he's ever known up until that point right do you think well they're further counting at all I keep the trafford are they just kind of in the moment I think they're in the longer than me I think it's too far all right so let's hear from Michael then okay results we ready I think we're ready did they break the record so the mark to eat was 52 spins on a Spanish web you did 54 it's a new if I took welcome to the case no records family you live power officially amazing I want to do it again appreciate you truly appreciate it that's awesome Thank You Business Insider was very flattering Susie here in circles whereas little bit a horse or macular team thank you everybody thank you thank you thank you thank you for watching sure you catch her red now oh really slowly we're slowly yeah we were like I guess you know from the start yeah I felt prepared to do a job we get that Holman no it's the hardest part is the finishing because the Rope gets twisted up and I have to hunt twisted as I'm spinning it yeah it gets more and more time so we slow down as we go so he actually is to put more power to the zone not less a lot of seconds i've got killed us yeah I did too i'm i was surprised that's an awesome to hear thank you for coming out here thank you for everyone who's tuning in to watch how long have you guys been training for this this specific well we've been performing together for almost 10 years now we're approaching the 10-year like acrobatic annivers here but by this this particular skill we don't train very often because it's intense like I'm gonna go home now and we're probably crazy probably properly trained it lasts about seven years ago yeah that's until last week yeah so thank you to Guinness yeah and rosemary and cirque tacular and everybody for for asking us to do this because we probably wouldn't have brought it out otherwise so appreciate how you doing you a witness we have any other questions oh yeah what's what's next for you guys are you guys gonna I another world record well maybe you know we have a couple other that we've been that we've been wanting to do so maybe that'll be next but the next big project that's happening we have an off-broadway show coming the art of Sergei it's going to be premiering in September which is a really cool blend of the visual arts an incredible score by postmodern jukebox Jesse elder and and really thrilling acrobatics and dance so it's gonna be a cool show that's completely where they were making from scratch right now that we're rehearsals for so that's our next big project right yeah so you guys I mean you're you were only up there for about a minute and it was a lot of hard work are you guys gonna have to recover the road for like the rest of the day or is it like a little bit of cash he's got it he's got it I gotta get going I got a movie to catch I have a massage after the movie oh my life in the circus performer yeah the tough life that we were you know we have the risk of dying we're going to the movies and getting massages so it's like well mines massage in a lot so I know someone's gonna ask but which movie are you gonna see uh I think I'm gonna go see Ghostbusters again oh yeah fun thought yesterday go see it again today we write like for pets but I saw that are a lot of movies I see is that a good way to recovery watch mean that we do our training is quite intense and performing is exceedingly intense not physically but emotionally it takes a lot out of you so when you're not training enough performing through trying to recover and stay healthy and just kind of decompress and not expend energy and stuff because we give a lot to our audiences and it really spends you so we're not working we're breathing I had no idea that I would still be doing this kind of stuff in my 40s so it's so it's cool that that's still happening and hope to keep it going as long as possible but yeah we do a lot of maidens 43 it's tough to keep it together oh that's great well thank you guys so much this is a circular team into the new record home thank you for the most hands mins in 30 seconds Thank You Guinness World Records and thank you for joining us today we had so much fun we can't wait to witness the next control blacker
