back at rebel headquarters now we've got a great guest for you guys Alexandria Casa Cortez she's running against Joseph Crowley in New York and this is a pivotal race because Crowley is the fourth ranking member of the Democrats in the house he is considered the congressman from Wall Street and and a lot of the Democrats brag about that but I don't think that's necessarily a thing you should brag about and and Alexandria is a progressive challenger to them from the just Democrats great to talk to you again awesome yeah I'm so happy to be here Genk thank you for having me on yeah no problem and since we last talked the Wall Street Journal is called you quote the most serious challenger in years to Crowley so there's no question that race is heating up and as we've seen all across the country once you've got progressives in primaries all of a sudden those incumbents wind up becoming a little bit more progressive that's right you know a lot of people know that our challenge and the media has even credited us with the fact that our challenge forced Joseph Crowley to co-sponsor Medicare after all of course that doesn't mean that he's going to continue supporting it once Democrats have a majority but we were able to get that crucial co-sponsorship and was also so great jank is that we were able to do this all with small dollar donations and sometimes the the chicken-and-egg is that the media won't recognize you as a serious candidate unless you've raised millions of dollars or hundreds of thousands of dollars and so people tried to raise that money just to be recognized by the media we were able to kind of cut through without having to take men without having to take millions of dollars from special interests we were able to get outlets and publications like The Wall Street Journal to call us the most serious challenger in in over a decade and so let's talk about one advantage that a progressive challenger like you has and one most importantly that doesn't a corporate PAC money because the Democratic Party sure they attack Donald Trump in a couple of different ways and boy does he have it coming but the one thing that I he's most vulnerable about but the Democrats almost never attack him on is corruption the reality is he's serving his donors and that's why he lied about the tax plan and how he was gonna raise taxes on the hedge fund guys but instead did the opposite he said you know he was gonna protect Social Security Medicare Medicaid that the opposite all for tax cuts for the rich so an obvious line of attack that Crowley could do is look at his donors that's why he's doing all the things that he's doing now is there a good reason why Crowley might not take up that line of attack of course it's because Joseph Crowley's shares the same pool of donors as Donald Trump and this is the dirty little secret about certain Democratic candidates that take an insane amount of money from Wall Street pharmaceutical companies Wall Street lobbyists and so on it's that they all eat from and they all drink from the same well and so the reason that we can't hit Trump on the fact that he takes money from groups like Blackwater and luxury real estate developers is because Joseph Crowley takes the same amount of money and in fact the thing that's ironic about it is that the largest tax giveaway to corporations and the 1% before the GOP tax bill was the Bush tax cuts that Joseph Crowley in fact voted for in addition he voted for Puerto Rico to be sold over to Wall Street last year on to the promised act so this is a recurring problem and it is happening in both aspects of government and what we need to do in 2018 is to elect progressive Democratic candidates that don't take corporate money because that is the only way that we are going to get true progressive policies that implement systemic changes that create prosperity for working and middle-class Americans so that I'm not at all surprised by so and they got a giant giveaway in the pass-through portion of the tax in fact the last thing that people thought was the bob corker amendment she helped Trump and Kushner but to help Crowley's donors in New York so to me one of the the telling things is sure the Democrats had an easy path to resistance because they're in the minority and the Republicans mean their votes at all to pass those bills but when they did in the Bush years people like Dianne Feinstein and Crowley when the chips were on the line and nobody was looking back then and they didn't have progressive primary challengers they voted for those same tax cuts didn't they absolutely and we saw the same exact thing happened right after the GOP tax bill Crowley himself went public and said that there even when Democrats are in power they have no intention of repealing all of the GOP tax bill now while there are certain aspects that we hope you know maybe be preserved in terms of increasing the individual family deduction and so on at the end of the end of the day we probably know that those given giveaways to real estate developers will very likely be protected by Joseph Crowley so Alexandria right now they're having a debate in Congress and within the Democratic Party on whether they should insist on the DREAM Act as part of the budget showdown some people that were in leadership were saying well the budget is sacrosanct we shouldn't touch that because that could affect their beloved markets and and so we should try to do the DREAM Act outside of that and trade it for border security if you were in Congress and you defeat Crowley in you a situation like this comes up would you risk a budget showdown to make sure that the DREAM Act gets passed yes and I want to explain very carefully why I don't think that it's even a hundred percent necessary to shut down the government but the leverage that you get by by taking that courageous stance can force a negotiation before that happens and in this specific case with daca and the DREAM Act which has bipartisan support you know the thing that's so frustrating about this situation is that the whole reason Jeff Flake said and defended his vote for the GOP tax bill is because he said that he secured Republican votes for the DREAM Act and so this right here the budget deal is our opportunity to take flake to task and say show us the votes that you got these are Republicans saying that they are in public then public approval of the DREAM Act so by forcing their hand the same way that we should be doing with net neutrality by the way by forcing their hand and taking a stance on the budget bill we we create a showdown where people show their chips where the chips are down and rather they show their hand and so I do believe that strategically this is the right thing to do we are not in a time right now where we can just wait for the Republican Congress to do the right thing in fact some of them maybe even you know caught up as we learn about this FBI investigation we know that there's a lot of layers going on here and we need to force points of clarity and I do believe that the budget is a perfect time to be doing that it's not reckless if we force and if we're it's not reckless if we're reasonable about the things that we force a discussion on and I believe that this is one it has bipartisan support with Senate Senate members in particular and Republican Senate members at that going public saying that they would support the DREAM Act yeah I know for corporate Democrats anything that might touch their donors for a second they will call reckless maybe it's a reckless for them because that's what their campaigns depend on but not for the people so I want to touch on on the campaign so you apparently have a voter suppression issue in New York we've talked a little bit about this in the past but not that not the latest twist in this saga Democrats complain about voter suppression throughout the country as well they should it's a horrific issue but for it to be applied to Democrats in the very blue state of New York is particularly maddening well what's the latest twist here yeah absolutely so the thing about New York and the common misconception that New York is a progressive state comes from the fact that Democrats have an iron grip over the access to the ballot and access to who is on the ballot in particular as many people may know New York had the second lowest voter primary turnout in 2016 second only to Louisiana and on the other side of that there's also control over who can get access to the ballot so what Ocasio 2018 and what our campaigns next big initiative is is to get access to the ballot now Crowley's not only the chairman of the Queens Democratic Party I mean not only the congressman but he's the chairman of the queens Democratic Party which means that he not only controls things on a federal level but he controls who is on the local level and who's running for office on the local level and in order for us to get on the ballot we're going to have to probably turn in around 10,000 signatures in order to to even run for office to begin with because the moment a regular person decides that they want to run for office whether it's for City Council or state assembly or Congress they turn in their signatures and in the borough of Queens on the day that you turn in your signatures Joseph Crowley will send his lawyers to challenge you in court this is a system that is designed to keep working people working people not running for office it's a system designed and tactics that he uses to keep progressive candidates from running for office in the borough of Queens and frankly in New York City in general and this type of control over who can even run for office in the first place has no business in the hands of Joseph Crowley people who run for office are beholden to voters and voters should be the one who determines who runs who is able to run and so this is this isn't this also has wide implications on real estate and the cost of living on a local level because he takes his real estate developer money he controls who runs for office he had a very strong hand as many people know in determining who the City Council Speaker was who by the way takes regular meetings with real estate lobbyists and he hand-picked the citywide government in addition to federal congressional leadership so this is a very intricate web here of special interest but what we need people to understand is that the only way you win this thing is by having volunteers go out talk to their neighbors and collect signatures to help us get on the ballot in March so that's people power and if you are in the area and you want to help and make sure that people have a choice even if you know you're not sure which way they're gonna vote at least give them the opportunity and the choice so go to the description box on YouTube and comment section on Facebook and in I'll have a link for that you can just click on to volunteer to get those signatures all right so last issue you brought it up one more time cost of living in New York I know Manhattan's completely out of control but you know I'm not sure that I knew how bad it was in your district so tell us about that and why you think those does do the real estate developer there does that issue then affect the cost of living and how does all this play out absolutely absolutely so for those who don't know my district New York 14 is half in the Bronx half in Queens and also contains Rikers Island it's a very working-class district the median income flow surrounds 47 thousand dollars per year and what we saw in the Throgs Neck and East Bronx area which is the area that's in our district is that foreclosures have gone up a hundred and forty five percent in the borough of Queens in this area of Queens people are starting to foreclose on their homes and these foreclosures get scooped up by luxury real estate developers and when they have the favor of local elected officials this turns into a total raising of the area communities people who have been there for generations are now forced to move elsewhere and it is a total uprooting of the actual community that existed in New York 14 it is a huge problem additionally in foreclosures and Queens foreclosures include in Queens get sent to the surrogates court and so today Joseph Crowley has kind of been running a scheme where he appoints his political friends to the surrogates court and then they are able to actually profit off of every single foreclosure that goes to that court so it is it is a process of entrenched machine politics that profits off of this the despair in our district and we're here to say no more we're here to say that public officials have to 100% put the working families in their district first not before donors not before the wealthy not before anybody else working families need to come first in American policy and in local politics and that starts with fighting for equitable access to health care housing and food wouldn't it be amazing if you had a Congress person that actually fought for you and for citizens as opposed to the powerful let us whisper of a dream okay Alexandria Casa Cortez is clearly running to be that person and again all the links to her websites etc are in the description box thank you so much for joining us Alexandra and good luck on the race thank you so much Jake I really appreciate it Oprah
