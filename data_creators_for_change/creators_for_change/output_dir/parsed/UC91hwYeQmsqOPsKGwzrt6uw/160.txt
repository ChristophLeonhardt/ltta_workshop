so the situation is this still ride
around under foofy today we are going up
to Chrysler to see that's not working to
see if they'll bless us with a car
so hopefully that works out because
right now the situation is just rough
now look go around in my home at my back
road full of cars piece of micro pumping
johnny'll I have a vivid that's a new
school like a riding shotgun just go get
something cookin I don't know this car
is very unfaithful but try to spit it
one more time if it doesn't work this
thank you thank you so much happens you
can save in a day yeah all right
bye so now we're running a little late
we're going up to LA got this package my
people will be there oh this is for me
too
if you guys for thinking of me I love
these colors man good job guys
thank you a word this hoodie today
because it's my freedom
I know what an elite eleventy friend I
think that I will really do not even
write a graphic symbol of my successful
Cheetos I brush for for the first day
catching my slave and not in heaven
that's a below 1.4400 7-eleven keeps you
can I travel all the way to LA today we
won't let me on forgot a book I'm gonna
read because I leave residue literally I
got a piece anybody lucky I can't be the
only one County we're gonna guess take
the tops trouble lot bad person because
I want to risk the lives of my men
without driving on
on without my pregnant wife tell your
wife she would spear I would push that
help you came the manager yes I know I'm
good I was working you did really good
fit in a call at that time anything you
are compatible
that's like a lot of truth right there
now why you have dings oh okay I see I'm
trying to think of what compatible me
because we are two very different people
very different and I know they say
opposites attract I mean attract well I
wouldn't even say that we're complete
opposites
we're just really different people with
different interests different
backgrounds different beliefs this is
the week look it I mean like the belief
that matter as far as our faith and we
have the same thing they have the same
way which I think because we have the
same thing that's why we do well that's
why we large amount of like it
but like much the thing about your
interest in music written sciences
just ending it go or like look my values
for education
oh I didn't say your lack of value but
like values educationally at the same
way that I do yeah
so that's one of the things I hear a lot
of people say is like oh man she like
she doesn't listen to hip-hop I can't be
with microfiber
she don't know who the box is she
doesn't open this hardest I can't be
with someone today
you know and so for me I'm like like
Nate dog died between who's a know and
everybody was like was
I believe although you do leave in half
you're not going to systemic of course
because it doesn't matter that you don't
you don't know who they go John got me
 maps means anything
no no not nobody knew that
and everybody but like what I'll try to
say is unless I beat you up I know
really I'm just trying to say that
compatibility is that really something
that you need in order to have a healthy
fish that the same interest so the
highway look at what's on paddle ball me
because I'm creating now able to exist
or occur together without conflict
we're able to do that
so we would day
I would say to a younger man like y'all
I need somebody like this
or data health news
looks likely as for listen to this what
has knows this culture I feel like even
if you have different cultures you still
learn about the cultures it's okay that
you're even culturally different degree
yeah because we have a lot of like
interracial friends there
we'll be although we are the same life
right
couple difficulties like I'm not really
sure if I'm having contractions right
now or not but this will decides to do
his homework when you think I might be
in labor
we've had no foot No
