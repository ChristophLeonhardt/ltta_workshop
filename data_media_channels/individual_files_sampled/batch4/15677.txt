one of the most winning moments of Trump's first year in office has got to be you in the department of homeland security classified ante FFA's antics as domestic terrorist violence and there might be more where that came from if the unmasking aunty Fay act of 2018 gets passed let's take a look it's one thing to oppose antiva from a red state it's quite another thing to oppose it from a democrat state like New York but that's exactly what New York representative Dan Donovan is doing dan introduced the unmasking antiva Act to the house the bill says whoever whether or not acting under color of law while in disguise including while wearing a mask injures oppresses threatens or intimidates any person in any state territory Commonwealth possession or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States or because of his having so exercised the same she'll be fined under this title in prison not more than 15 years or both so basically this would raise the number of years you could face in prison by five years if you threaten or assault someone while wearing a mask and it seems pretty reasonable to discourage people from covering their faces in public I mean people don't exactly do that if they plan on following the law do they know people are more likely to commit crimes while covered up because there's less chance of being identified and getting caught so to counteract that we need to make the penalty for getting caught higher but of course this means resisting the whining and squealing of left-wing activists the University of Colorado's young Democratic Socialist chapter said should any representative vote for it they must clearly be branded as the fascists they are right because name-calling has proven so effective in the past and didn't just totally backfire in the election of President Trump or anything even international parties weighed in North London and Tifa said imagine never unmasking the KKK the irony here is pretty poignant and I responded why not unmask both the KKK and antiva and then of course there were people like University of Chicago PhD student Island Kohan and reasoned editor Elizabeth Brown who think that this bill somehow will be used to punish people who are just wearing a mask to a protest now to be fair Elizabeth notes that the bill doesn't define words like a press and in Tim and yeah I'd appreciate some more clarity - especially given how colleges use these vague words to quell free speech but fortunately we have this supercool third branch of the government called the judiciary that interprets the law at the end of the day the media aren't very attentive when it comes to left-wing political violence and while sites like 4chan can hone in on some of the more egregious cases like by clock Professor Eric Clanton they can't catch them all but there will be fewer antiva to catch if disincentives like the unmasking antiva Act are ratified so call your representative and ask them to support the bill today for campus unmasked I'm Rob shim shock if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
