1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,470
down the skyline staircase through an
airlock steel door say Ichiro Nishimoto

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,170
welcomes us into his insurance against
Kim jong-un and Donald Trump tell me

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:22,170
what we're sitting in a shelter against
nuclear fallout 55 years ago when I

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,990
started selling shelters in Japan people
thought I was crazy he says who's crazy

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,290
now he asks as North Korea edges closer
to a long-range missile capable of

6
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,860
hitting the u.s. in America's new
president engaging in a war of words

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:45,600
with Kim jong-un they will be met with
fire and fury like the world has never

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,170
seen
Japan caught in the crosshairs of any

9
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,449
conflict in Trump's first six months as
president Mishimoto has sold more than a

10
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,520
dozen of his tropical-themed concrete
fortified shelters well that's not a lot

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,760
that's more than he sold in 55 years
housing developer Kazuma yoshiyama wants

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,670
in our customers asking for this yeah
how many of these are you thinking of

13
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:22,020
building yeah maybe it may not seem as
ridiculous as it sounds in a suburban

14
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,979
neighborhood in Wakayama Japan nestled
behind this traditional Japanese home

15
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,930
what is this made out of
Cory wanted this guy concrete concrete

16
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,600
so three layers of reinforced concrete
right here Yoshihiko kounotori bought

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,780
this small shelter fearing earthquakes
tsunami and the neighbor to his north I

18
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:51,000
always worry about the nuclear by North
Korea having the shelter does it give

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,509
you peace of mind that's right I feel
very peaceful selling that personal

20
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,590
peace in these shelters that range from
tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars

21
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,370
but you won't hear Nishimoto celebrate
the windfall Trump's extreme rhetoric

22
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,950
has heightened tensions with North Korea
he says you

23
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,580
don't know what he's going to do next
it's good if it goes well but if it

24
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,250
doesn't it could lead to a national
disaster night go ahead and say they're

25
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,870
prepping for the impossible but for a
region watching to unpredictable leaders

26
00:02:27,870 --> 00:00:00,000
they call it just being realistic
