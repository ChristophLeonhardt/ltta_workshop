from Zachary mr. Clavin I was ecstatic when Trump got rid of ten expenditures which essentially ended the climbing national debt later he gave in to a demand for a spending bill that has not only granted more spending but a spending that is greater than the horrific Obama administration will the debt ever be addressed and that is a really good question I think if there's a crisis question it's the unspoken crisis it's the thing that Paul Ryan is retiring without having address the thing he wanted to address the thing he tried to get people into involved in into so they would start to dial back entitlements and advance social security so you collected it a little later and that would help the debt the problem is the problem is is the structure of electoral politics favors stupid spending so for instance one of our big problems in California is unpaid pensions right we haven't got unfunded pensions why does that happen well the guy the police or the firemen come to the mayor and they say we want to raise and the mayor says look at my budget I don't have any money in the budget I can't give you a raise they say well give me give us higher pensions and the mayor thinks to himself huh the pensions don't kick in for ten years I'll be out of office what's the diff right so he does it he's not responsible for it the bill when the bill comes due it'll be in Florida on the beach you know and when California collapses and when some governor some governor has to go to the police and the fire department and the municipal workers and say hey guess what we can't pay your pensions we don't have the money we would have to tax everybody to death to pay off your pensions that guy is not the guy who made the concession in the negotiations same thing is true in the federal level so easy so easy for these people on the Left to say oh free this and free that and I always say you know the word free has no meaning there's no me I mean maybe the stars and the moon belong to everyone the best things in life are free but when you're talking about the labor of others it all costs money when they say free health care that word means nothing when they say free education nothing when you hear somebody say free what you should translate that into as I am standing before you talking nonsense so you will vote for me but the thing is when you vote for that guy and the the bill finally comes do he's not gonna be there anymore you know it's then he can say then they say to you oh we just have to raise taxes on the rich we just raise taxes on the rich and then when all the jobs leave and the economy collapses and and the spirit goes out of the country they're gone it's the you know it's already over so the the structure is built to encourage stupid spending it takes somebody with moral courage like Paul Ryan to come out and say we got to address this and he failed because it was easier and and Donald Trump is partly to blame for this not only he's not only to blame for it but he's partly to blame for it for saying I will not touch your Social Security touch it you've got oh it's the bait it's the ballast of the debt is that where most of the debt is coming from it can be reformed and preserved without destroying the country and without destroying a generation so I'm not I won't say I'm optimistic but I haven't lost all hope that's the way it comes because people with courage do come along
