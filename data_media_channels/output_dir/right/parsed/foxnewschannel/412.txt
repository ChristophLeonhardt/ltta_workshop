RIGHT NOW.
>> Dana: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I'M JOINED BY BRETT LARSEN.
MORNING ANCHOR ON MORNING
HEADLINES ON SIRIUS XM.
THE ALERT WORKED.
MY PHONE IS ON SILENT.
>> SO IS MINE.
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE ALERT YET.
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS,
THE ALERT GOES FROM FEMA.
IT GOES TO THE CELL TOWERS AND
THE CELL TOWERS WILL START
SENDING OUT THE ALERT OVER AND
OVER FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR
PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL EVERYONE
WHO HAS THEIR PHONE ON GETS IT.
IF YOU HAVE YOUR PHONE TURNED
OFF, IF YOU LEAVE IT OFF FOR THE
NEXT 45 MINTS.
>> Dana: I DID GET THE ALERT.
IT JUST DIDN'T MAKE THE SOUND.
I MUST BE ON A SPECIAL LIST THAT
YOU'RE NOT ON.
>> YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SECURITY
CLEARANCE.
>> Dana: IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO
HAVE THIS SYSTEM.
>> IT IS A GOOD IDEA.
AS DOUG MENTIONED, WE'VE ALL
GOTTEN ALERTS BEFORE.
I REMEMBER MANY YEARS AGO DURING
HURRICANE SANDY STANDING OUT
WATCHING THE HUDSON RIVER COMING
UP THE STREET.
WE ALL GOT THE WARNING AT THE
SAME TIME.
IT'S A GOOD IDEA WHEN YOU
CONSIDER HOW MUCH, HOW MANY OF
US ARE USING OUR CELL PHONES AND
AREN'T NECESSARILY, WE DON'T
HAVE A RADIO IN OUR POCKET.
WE DO HAVE A RADIO.
>> Dana: BUT FLOODING AND AMBER
ALERTS.
THOSE ARE LOCALIZED EVENTS.
WHAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE THAT
WOULD RISE TO THE OCCASION?
I CAN IMAGINE.
BUT WHAT DO WE KNOW?
>> WE WOULD ASSUME SOMETHING
LIKE A 9/11 ATTACK WOULD RESULT
IN AN ALERT LIKE THIS.
SOMETHING THAT DEFINITELY HAS AN
EFFECT NATIONWIDE.
NOT, AS YOU MENTIONED, AN AMBER
ALERT WILL BE LOCALIZED,
FLOODING.
THOSE ARE LOCALIZED.
>> Dana: IF YOU GET ONE OF
THESE, IT'S FOR REAL.
>> HOPEFULLY WE WILL NOT HAVE A
SITUATION LIKE WE HAD IN HAWAII
WHERE SOMEONE --
>> Dana: ACCIDENTALLY.
RIGHT.
