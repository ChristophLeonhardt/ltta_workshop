FOR YOU TO SAY THAT?

46
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,020
>> YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

47
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,858
THAT WAS A DUMB IDEA.

>> GREG: THAT'S OKAY.

49
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:06,159

>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

58
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,014
WHY DID I COUNT ALL THE SAND?

59
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:28,748
IT COULD'VE HAD A FAMILY, WIFE

60
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:29,115

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,096
I'M GOING TO EAT IT.

68
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:43,630

00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:51,738
THESE SEGMENTS BUT THEY'RE GOING

73
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:59,646

>> I FEEL LIKE THERE COULD BE

90
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:19,999
SURPRISES.

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:32,378
PEOPLE ARE VERY AFRAID TO SAY

92
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,179
WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO AND MAYBE

93
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,980
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY INTEND

94
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:34,280

LEAST WHEN SOMETHING MAYBE

141
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:58,898
BEFORE THEY HAVE A COUNTRYWIDE

142
00:04:58,899 --> 00:04:59,499
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN?

143
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,266
>> PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY WERE ON THE

144
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,968
VERGE OF A CIVIL WAR.

145
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:02,402
NO WERE NOT.

146
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:03,169
THAT INVOLVES PEOPLE GETTING OUT

147
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,641
OF THEIR HOUSE.

148
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,409

00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:15,581
FORTNIGHT AS THE CIVIL WAR.

152
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:16,316
I LOVE THAT TAYLOR SWIFT CAME

153
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:16,916
OUT MADE AN ENDORSEMENT.

154
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:17,684
TWO DAYS LATER HE DUMPED THAT

155
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:18,384
FOR KATY PERRTY ENDORSEMENT.

156
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:26,159
BUT I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS.

157
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,993
THE IDEA THAT HILLARY IS BACK ON

158
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:27,627

THOUGHTS ON TAYLOR SWIFT?

166
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,080

00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:47,814
OUR CULTURE THINK SO YOU LOOK

168
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:48,881
GOOD DANCING AROUND IN THE

LEOTARD.

170
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:49,982

THOUGHTS LIKE WHAT I'M DOING

177
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:02,595
REALLY MATTER?

178
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,264
WHEN I GET OUT OF BED ON THE DAY

179
00:06:05,265 --> 00:00:00,000
I VOTE I KNOW IT TO DEFINITELY
