based on what you just saw there again we should note that Peterson's attorney said last month that this video would exonerate him if you will does this video do that on the one hand when you see this video I think many of us had started to build this image in their minds of officer Peterson out in the parking lot hundreds of yards away and what you see is that the school is similar to many Florida schools it's got several buildings with walkways in between and he's within those walkways he certainly on school grounds inside the area of the school but on the other hand there does appear to be video of him from a distance leaning up against a wall and clearly not going into the building to the extent you can see that figure at the end of the shot right there so the and when it comes down to a legal analysis when it comes to civil liability people are very surprised to learn that government entities like schools and police officers don't have an affirmative duty to protect citizens there or ensure them against harm by a private third party the main responsibility they have is to not create a dangerous situation but that can be an exception to the general rule that they're not liable and if someone concludes if a court concludes that by remaining outside he somehow created a danger or violated his contractual duty if he had one with the school then there could be an exception but generally speaking it's very very difficult to hold beliefs police officers or schools liable for the safety of their students against private actors it sounds like what I'm hearing you say is essentially cowardice is not a crime I don't know that that video necessarily shows coward even if I mean this video that was standing in general cowardice is not a crime I don't know that I would say that as a legal principle Craig what I would say is that you cannot the courts have long said that you cannot impose upon a police a duty to guarantee the safety of the public against other members of the public and that's been applied to schools it's been applied to police officers unless they create the danger themselves it can be very difficult to hold them liable hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
