1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,190
Rudy Giuliani is technically
off the clock,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,540
and physically
across the globe.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,730
But America’s mayor is very
much in the limelight.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,680
“What is going on
with Rudy Giuliani?”

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,350
“Rudy Giuliani is being widely
criticized today

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,690
for comments he made
in Israel.”

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,370
“Going rogue once again.”

8
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,880
“Rudy Giuliani diverted
from the official lines.”

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,840
“And you have to wonder:
Why?”

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,560
During a trip to Israel for
a private speaking engagement,

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,520
Giuliani, who is now one
of Trump’s private lawyers,

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,940
chose to weigh in on an array
of hot-button issues.

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,562
First, there was his
explosive account

14
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,270
of how the North Korean
leader apparently

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,700
demeaned himself to get
President Trump to reschedule

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,390
the summit.

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,360
“Well, Kim Jong-un
got back on his hands

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,880
and knees and begged for
it, which is exactly

19
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,620
the position you
want to put him in.”

20
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,320
Giuliani also floated a theory

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,340
to tarnish the Russia investigation.

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,880
“A group of 13 highly
partisan Democrats

23
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,120
that make up the Mueller
team — excluding him —

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,290
are trying very, very hard
to frame [Trump],

25
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,690
to get him in trouble when
he hasn’t done anything wrong.”

26
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,610
But Giuliani reserved
the bulk of his fire

27
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,760
for Stormy Daniels,
who has become one of

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,930
President Trump’s archenemies.

29
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,600
“I’m sorry.

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,570
I don’t respect a
porn star star the way

31
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,490
I respect a career woman.

32
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,170
So, Stormy, you want
to bring a case?

33
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,385
Let me cross-examine you.”

34
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:15,875
As for Daniels’ alleged affair

35
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:19,230
with President Trump in 2006,
Giuliani said it was a lie.

36
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,640
“Oh, very, very
credible source: Stormy,

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,720
Stormy the porn star.

38
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,520
I don’t believe her.

39
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,229
I don’t know — sue me, Stormy.

40
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,020
I don’t believe you.”

41
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,630
And neither does
Melania Trump,

42
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,320
according to Giuliani.

43
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,610
“She believes in her husband.

44
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,790
She knows it’s not true.

45
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,170
Look at his three wives, right?

46
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,250
Beautiful women, classy women,
women of great substance.

47
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,750
Stormy Daniels?”

48
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,020
“We have to respect
on the stage every woman.”

49
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,680
“Yes, I respect porn stars.

50
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,610
Don’t you respect porn stars?

51
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,490
Or do you think that
porn stars desecrate women?”

52
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,110
One thing that was less
controversial:

53
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,584
Giuliani appeared to be enjoying
his visit to the Holy Land

54
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,510
as cameras spotted
him partaking in some

55
00:01:59,510 --> 00:00:00,000
napkin-spinning revelry
at a Jerusalem hot spot.
