1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,060
“So once I added your RSS feed to our site,
every single article that is published on

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,020
Vox.com is getting sent through a feed and
we’re just like automatically creating a

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,110
video for it.”

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,150
“Oh my god that is so crazy.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,520
Every single article through our feed.”

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,009
“Every single article.”

7
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:16,009
This is Wibbitz.

8
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:19,640
It’s one of the companies automating news
video production.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,380
You might call this the robot coming for my
job.

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,740
“So this article, our algorithm will just
intelligently summarize it into just a quick

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,710
30 second to 1 minute video.

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,690
And then based on the keywords in the article,
it’s gonna match relevant media to it.”

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,890
It’s pretty impressive when you think about
all the ways it could get confused.

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,820
“In the beginning it was very rough.

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,320
People with the same names would confuse it.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,989
Turkey the country and turkey the animal would
be another example.”

17
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:04,620
Their product was built with machine learning
algorithms, and it became more accurate over time.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,620
The result is a video made in a few seconds
that’s not drastically different from what

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,820
a human would make in several hours, given
the same constraints.

20
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,180
Wibbitz is part of a rapidly growing industry
of so-called “AI-powered” products.

21
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,740
The number of companies mentioning artificial
intelligence in their earnings calls has skyrocketed

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,790
in the past 3 years.

23
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,869
But the truth is that the term “artificial
intelligence” isn’t very well defined.

24
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:34,470
“What happens with AI is that initially
lots of things are called artificial intelligence.

25
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,770
It used to be the expert systems; the kind
of systems that fly airplanes were called

26
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,770
artificial intelligence.

27
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,149
Then once they were working and routine and
everyone takes them for granted, then they

28
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:48,150
are not called AI anymore.”

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,189
Right now when people talk about AI, they’re
mostly talking about “machine learning”

30
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:55,990
- a subfield of computer science that dates
back at least to the 1950s.

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,810
And the methods that are popular today aren’t
fundamentally different from algorithms invented

32
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,660
decades ago,
So why all the interest and investment right now?

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,620
I asked Manuela Veloso, the head of the machine
learning department at Carnegie Mellon.

34
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,599
“You have to understand that there is something
very important about these past years.

35
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,170
It's data.

36
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,650
We humans became collectors of data.

37
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:25,810
Fitbits, GPSes, pictures, I mean look how
much credit card purchases, how much data

38
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,450
is around.”

39
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,370
Certain machine learning algorithms really
thrive on big data, as long as computers have

40
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,580
the processing power to handle it, which they
do now.

41
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,540
If computers are the cannon and the internet
is gunpowder, these are the fireworks and

42
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,700
they have only just begun.

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,120
In his book, Pedro Domingos offers a nice
simple way of understanding

44
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,100
supervised machine learning.

45
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,680
He says:
“Every algorithm has an input and an output:

46
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,670
the data goes into the computer, the algorithm
does what it will with it, and out comes the

47
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,750
result.

48
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,330
Machine learning turns this around: in goes
the data and the desired result and out comes

49
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,650
the algorithm that turns one into the other.”

50
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,420
The algorithms are
trained to find statistical relationships

51
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,840
in the data that allow it to make good guesses
when presented with new examples.

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,010
That means we no longer have an easy rule
for what kinds of tasks computers can and

53
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,000
cannot do.

54
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,440
“Ten years ago, I could have said with confidence,
we know how this works to computerize something

55
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,080
you need to understand all the steps, then
you script the steps and get a dumb machine

56
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,690
to do it and just follow mechanistically the
process that you would have followed.

57
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,569
But now we have machines, I shouldn't say we,
I don't make them.

58
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,940
People have developed machines that learn
from data.

59
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:51,910
That makes it harder to say what set of jobs
are going to become substituted, readily substituted

60
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,400
by automation, and which will be complemented.”

61
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,380
A study by the McKinsey Global Institute gets
at this question by looking at the many tasks

62
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,140
that make up 800 different occupations.

63
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:07,360
And they grouped those tasks into 7 categories:
3 that are highly susceptible to automation

64
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,769
with currently-demonstrated technologies,
and 4 that are not.

65
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,519
“Things like managing people, they include
things like creativity, they include things

66
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,269
like decision-making or judgment.

67
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:24,621
And caring work that requires empathy or human
interaction, with an emotional content to

68
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:26,050
associate with it.

69
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,440
Those are much harder things to automate.”

70
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,820
The report concluded that while most jobs
include some tasks that can be automated,

71
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,139
less than 5% of occupations can be fully automated.

72
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,690
“So this idea of occupations and jobs changing
may actually be a bigger effect than the question

73
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,229
of jobs disappearing, although of course,
there are some jobs that will disappear or

74
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:47,720
at least decline.”

75
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,920
That’s because most jobs are made up of
a bunch of different tasks and most of today’s

76
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,690
AI can only do one task.

77
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,690
Don’t get me wrong.

78
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,710
They can be really good at that task.

79
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:02,020
A deep neural network watched 5000 hours of
BBC news with captions and now it can read

80
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,780
lips  better than human professionals.

81
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,660
And machine learning algorithms trained on
images of tumors can predict lung cancer survival

82
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,520
better than human pathologists.

83
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,040
The mistake is to assume that these focused
applications can add up to

84
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,980
a more general intelligence.

85
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,479
Or that they learn like we do, which is simply
not the case.

86
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,830
When they get the right answer it’s tempting
to assume they understand what they see.

87
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,160
Only when they make a mistake do we get a
glimpse at how different their process is

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,210
from our own.

89
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,410
It’s pattern recognition masquerading as
understanding.

90
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,960
That’s why researchers can easily trick
a learning algorithm into mislabeling a picture.

91
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,580
“A lot of machine learning, at this point,
is very superficial and very brittle.

92
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:46,889
It's based on immediately observable features,
which may or may not be essential to what's

93
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:47,889
going on.”

94
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,960
Last year the director Oscar Sharp produced
a short film that was written by a neural

95
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,070
network trained on sci-fi movie scripts.

96
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,250
“The principle is completely constructed
of the same time.”

97
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,090
“It was all about you to be true.”

98
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,419
“You didn’t even see the movie with the
rest of the base.”

99
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:04,419
“I don’t know.”

100
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:05,419
“I don’t care.”

101
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:06,419
It’s great.

102
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:07,419
It makes no sense.

103
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:11,000
Because it doesn’t have what a 5-year-old
child has, which is an abstract model of how

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,020
the world works, why things happen, or what
a story is.

105
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,020
And why should it?

106
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,960
We evolved these things over millions of years.

107
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,970
“So there's a lot it can do, much more than
before but I mean, we humans are amazing,

108
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,870
I think. We are very broad, see.”

109
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,290
AI applications will keep getting better.

110
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:35,770
Robot voices used to sounds like this.

111
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:42,190
Now they can sound like this.

112
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,940
Which means Wibbitz will so be able to offer
natural-sounding narration.

113
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,259
Algorithms are also starting to analyze video
frames.

114
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:54,930
IBM trained a system to select the scenes
for a movie trailer.

115
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,810
So instead of just pulling generic clips,
Wibbitz might pull specific ones.

116
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,680
But there’s no clear path toward a more
human-like intelligence which includes common

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,199
sense, curiosity, and abstract reasoning.

118
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,080
“I think AI is as good as the content that

119
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,500
goes through it.

120
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:19,490
So you can’t really expect AI to do magic
which some people expect it to do.”

121
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,400
Machine learning algorithms can translate
37 languages but they don’t know what a

122
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
chair is for.

123
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,410
They’re nothing like us, and that’s what
makes them such a powerful tool.

124
00:07:28,410 --> 00:00:00,000
Wibbitz will never make this video, but AI
could help me make a better one.
