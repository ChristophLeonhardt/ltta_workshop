on this Tuesday night we are now exactly and I mean exactly four weeks away on a Tuesday night from an election in which today's polling news is very very good news for the Democrats now it's only today's polling news so we don't know how long this is going to hold but at this hour on election night four weeks from now we will begin to see if the Democrats are winning a possible wave election that the latest polling indicates could be developing across the country a new report from Politico today finds that the number of seats in the House of Representatives that are solidly Democratic or leaning Democratic is now up to 209 if Democrats won all of those seats they would then need to win only nine of the currently 26 toss-up races in order to win back the House of Representatives the Democrats chances of doing that have never looked better than they look tonight a new CNN poll finds the Democrats lead Republicans in the generic ballot for Congress by 13 points that is the widest margin Democrats have held in that poll since 2006 in the midterm elections when Democrats picked up 31 House seats and took back control of the house while they were also picking up six Senate seats to win back control the United States Senate the first time that the Democrats controlled the house in the Senate since 1994 the new polling indicates that the battle over Brett Cavanaugh's confirmation has made Democrats even more likely to go out and vote in this congressional election to give power back to the Democrats today's polling shows the gap between Democratic and Republican enthusiasm has widened once again now giving Democrats a ten-point advantage over Republicans and that change is also accompanied by a widening gender gap that favors Democrats women now favor Democratic candidates 63 to 33 Democrats are competitive in districts that Donald Trump won overwhelmingly in West Virginia for example in a congressional district that Trump won by 50 points the most recent poll shows Democrat richard oj da five points ahead of Republican Carol Miller here is the Democrats thirty second appeal to West Virginia voters in that district that has him in the lead tonight I'm Richard ole Jetta and I've been under fire multiple times in places like Iraq and Afghanistan tattooed on my back are the names of my brothers that did not come home now my military record and my love of this country has come under fire once again by Carol Miller how dare she a millionaire who is a joy to life of privilege under the very freedoms that I have fought for I approve this message because I love this country and I'm willing to fight for it and you joining our discussion now ambassador Wendy Sherman and MSNBC global affairs contributor and the author of the new book not for the faint of heart lessons in Courage power and persistence also joining us Jennifer Palmieri a former White House communications director for President Obama and former communications director for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign Jason Johnson politics editor at the root comm and an MSNBC contributor and Jennifer Palmieri oh I want to start with you on the on the politics of this of the poll that I was just citing was taken over this past weekend incorporating the after-effects of the cabin on nomination fight and that poll looks very good for Democrats yes nevertheless she voted right I think that could be the repercussions that that the Republicans face and you know I I think you me women are probably more determined to show up now than ever before when it comes to voting next month but I also see something different even in my own life experience from women who are not that involved in politics getting in touch with me to be really express their confusion even let alone dismay at how the Republicans handled the nomination I think that there's you there's two prices the Republicans pay there's what Trump says and does and then there's the Republicans backing him up and I think a lot of women you know who aren't that involved in politics don't pay as much attention as you know those of us do this for a living thought that the Republicans would not allow the way Christine Busby Ford was treated to go forward would would not after hearing what she had to say vote to confirm him and now that they did I think you see this wave coming through America and how women are waking up to say wow this Republican Party really is not it's is really not for me personally and I suspect that they're gonna pay a price not just next month but they're gonna have a long term problem with women coming out of this and apparently Donald Trump doesn't know how to read the polling effects of the Cavanaugh confirmation because he was out there tonight today in a rally talking about the Cavanaugh nomination and basically leading the crowd in another chant of lock her up and this time it meant lock up Diane Feinstein and ambassador Sherman this is the party that claimed that the Cavanaugh confirmation procedure should be all about due process should be all about the presumption of innocence in the accused and here is the president going up there out there leading the lock her up chant that he invented he and his crowd invented which of course is exactly the opposite of what the Republican have already pretended to stand for yeah Lawrence you know one of the things I want to say to everybody who's listening tonight and has friends and relatives and co-workers is that change doesn't come easily and these numbers are very encouraging for a turnover at least of the house come the election four weeks from tonight but I ran Barbara Mikulski's campaign in 1986 she was the first democratic woman ever elected in her own right she and Nancy Kassebaum were the only two women senators we now have more but I also helped to need a hill in 1991 and I came across an old cartoon of Spector Simpson and hatch all sort of in thug outfits with you know battering rams and whatnot with Anita Hill lying on the floor was a Baltimore Sun cartoon and the caption was I don't understand why she didn't come forward sooner my point here is that this is a story that has repeated itself in many ways and many times and so my message to all the viewers tonight who want to see change who believe there needs to be change all the voters that Jen just talked about if you have early voting in your state go vote if you can absentee ballot vote vote now and if not get out there and vote if your registration isn't finished yet get ten young people to go out and vote Millennials and the pew data are shown to vote less now than any of a similar cohort previously and so we really need to get out vote or these numbers will not matter in four weeks and you can rest assured whether it's a summit with the North Korean leader to prove how good a Donald Trump is on foreign policy or ginning up more Locker up messages to try to keep his base enraged he will pull every trick out of the bag and so we must persist and Jayson I have the video here of none'll Trump talking about senator Feinstein and lying about her and attacking her and getting the crowd to chant lock her up about Dianne Feinstein which I'm deliberately not showing because the only point of it it's really ugly political pornography and and but the point of it is the Donald Trump tonight today and out there campaigning doesn't seem to realize that getting his people to scream lock her up about yet another woman who has done absolutely nothing wrong without any due process is exactly the kind of thing that is stimulating this Democratic enthusiasm yeah but it didn't stop Susan Collins right like I mean like Donald Trump knows what he's doing here he knows that there is a a significant portion of women in America we're gonna support him no matter what he's doing but I think with these numbers show is something that I anticipated all along if it took Brett Kavanaugh for you to realize that the Republicans are a party of misogyny and supporting accused sex abusers then you were really kind of late to the game I think most people kind of do that already and his confirmation has just emboldened Democrats even more but I think it goes deeper than just women being enthusiastic about the party it goes into the fact that I think Democrats have been beaten down for so long by candidate who they thought they should have beaten two years ago that they've become more strategic you've seen absentee ballots in Georgia applications go up to levels that haven't been seen since Obama in 2008 you see an extensive ground game going on in Florida you see the Ohio governor's race at 5050 and this is a race that should have been in slam dunk for the Republicans so I think Democrats have seen Cavanaugh's hey this is something to gin up our voters more but it hasn't stopped them from engaging in the kind of on-the-ground strategy yet you actually need to win as opposed to making it a national election and Jennifer we see things like Taylor Swift just taught that suddenly entering social media with a political message about registering to vote and huge surge instantly as a result of that something that would have been hard to imagine a short time ago yeah and she's been famously I mean we certainly tried on the Clinton campaign to get her support and she was somebody who stayed out of politics and I was surprised I was surprised at the reaction honestly I wasn't sure if even with a house as popular where she is how much more juicer was to get out from you know from women you know from young women to register to vote but that was phenomenal response and you know and it's like really encouraging because you know we got we still got a month we still got a little month left to go you got to keep the energy up you got to get actually turnout people to vote you know it's wendy lamented but everybody to not not be over confident but i think you just see this you know I just see determination is what I see in how women have responded from the women's March over a year ago you know right at the time of the inaugural until now and you know I just I hope everyone does turnout but I feel like this women are not are not the ones that are going to be want to let us down listen listen the way senator Elizabeth Warren is talking to campaign rally crowds this time today in Georgia those Republicans Amanda got a lot going there leg oh you bet they did I got the White House they got the House of Representatives I got the cynic that I'm gonna tell you this our other PS than them I'll tell you why they may have the money they may have the power right now but there's a whole lot more of us than URI and Wendy Sherman she is right about the math indeed you know all of the signs are pointing in the right direction so I don't want to be a downer here at all what I want to do is to encourage people that take that determination those numbers and turn it out at the voting booth to make real the change that can happen here this is going to be a tough fight but courage always comes with a cost there's usually a price to pay and the price here may be the contributions you make to a campaign as volunteer the time that you give up to register voters the time you give up to take people to the polls but it's critical that we do everything we possibly can to make sure that the surprises that Jason was talking about don't occur and that the good things that we're seeing as he described in Georgia as Jen described in what she's seeing out there and determination come real and Jason what's your sense of how long the enthusiasm can be sustained well that's the beautiful part Laurens enthusiasm and anger last forever the Republicans mad at Obama for eight years so Democrats can stay angry I'll give you a perfect example my class tonight I was teaching my class at Morgan State came here to studio every single one of the students on my political reporting class are actually registered to vote that wasn't even the case in 2016 they are registered to vote in a state where Ben Jealous is very far behind so and I didn't have to force them to it I now offer extra credit so you know I'm seeing both here in Maryland which is a blue state I'm going to be in Georgia this weekend I've seen a surprising number of people taking care of the practical things and remaining enthusiastic for example you've got a a website being sent out right now in Georgia helping people make sure they're registered to vote because Brian Kemp is notorious for erasing the polls and purging people right before the election deadline so again I see people being more dedicated being more focused not just marching and being happy not just saying we're gonna listen to black women but actually getting out there helping candidates in doing the practical work and fighting against voter suppression which is what the Democrats have to do in order to make sure these close races actually turn into victories thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC
