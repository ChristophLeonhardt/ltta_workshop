21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,800
how i came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the idea of wrapping</font>

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,390
panties around the vinyl in the

packaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Alice's album school's out</font>

24
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,340
it started because I read a story about

00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,500
a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> shipment of paper panties being</font>

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,079

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,840
me as hysterical then when we designed

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,760
in the jacket for schools out we decided

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,200
it should look like an old-fashioned

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,630
wooden school desk the kind where the

35
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,369
top flipped up and there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font>

36
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,409
underneath for your pencils and rulers

37
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,990
and such the album<font color="#CCCCCC"> would go in there and</font>

38
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,090
we were thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to put in</font>

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,340
there with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> something a bad kid with</font>

that someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else said bubblegum I</font>

43
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,270
remember the panties what was the

44
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,369
coolest thing a seventh grade boy could

45
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">be hiding in his desk what if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap</font>

46
