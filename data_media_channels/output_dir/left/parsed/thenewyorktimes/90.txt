On Aug. 4,
Venezuelan President
Nicolás Maduro
was apparently the target
of an assassination attempt.
Maduro was giving a speech,
here, in front of troops.
Then something
exploded in midair,
probably less than the
length of a football field
away from the president.
A second explosion
happened 14 seconds later,
two blocks away.
The day ended in mayhem
and mass confusion.
And it’s still unclear
who launched the attack.
But by reconstructing
the events,
we can get a
clearer look
at how it unfolded.
Hundreds of soldiers
take formation on historic
Avenida Bolívar in Caracas.
Maduro is hosting a ceremony
honoring the National Guard.
It’s a demonstration
of strength
for his dictatorship,
broadcast live on state TV.
About an hour into the event,
Maduro and others nervously
notice something above them.
Two minutes later, something
suddenly interrupts him.
The state broadcast
cuts to a soldier,
but the same
scene was captured
by a different camera.
In this clip,
you can hear an
explosion and see
Maduro’s bodyguards
running to protect him.
Around this area,
cellphone video captured a
drone exploding in midair —
above the military parade,
and within Maduro’s sightlines.
Two blocks away,
another drone is seen.
It flies into an apartment
building and crashes.
It detonates 14 seconds
after the first explosion.
The sound can be heard
at the ceremony grounds,
and it sends
the crowd fleeing.
You can see a hole on the
wall where the drone exploded.
We analyzed the
images of both drones.
They are DJI M600
commercial drones.
Each costs about $5,000.
They can carry up
to 13 pounds
in a three-mile radius.
Here we see a likely camera
and explosives attached.
According to the
Venezuelan authorities,
the drones carried C-4
plastic explosives.
These are commonly used by
military and law enforcement.
They’re moldable and
usually triggered remotely.
Seven soldiers were
injured by the explosion
at the parade.
In the aftermath 
of the incident,
authorities arrested
six people
and started to crack down
on opposition lawmakers.
