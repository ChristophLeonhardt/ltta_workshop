hi sorry this isn't my caitlin video
because that one will actually take
effort and I'll do it at the end of the
week I just want to make a quick video
to brag because I just finished my
project that's due tomorrow
I'm so excited because I bought a glue
gun and I made things and I'm terrible
at making things and I finished it it's
taken me three days come when I say I'm
terrible I mean I'm not good at all with
guns and things like that
you know what I was really hard I kept
going and guess what I made look I made
a miniature runway to display my
business cards I'm so excited
and just in case you missed what those
beautiful little details I added in the
side learn look look look look look I
made miniature floodlights look and they
catch the light of the silver cardboard
cop that teacher yeah I know I'm nuts
now glue but you know why I have to do
this kind of it's because I go to
an arts college now and it means that
kids don't just show up with you know a
portfolio folder or anything no because
that would be normal that would be what
I would do they come and they bring
these bloody masterpieces ok guys so
we're here to give our final
presentations of our essays which I'm
very forward to seeing so I guess we'll
we'll start with you know well I decided
to represent my essay not only through
writing but also through portraits
abstraction portraits abstract well done
Robert so Julia what have you prepared
well I thought it was inappropriate just
to write an essay in words so I made an
audio track to go with it
and I'll server to interview dad's work
I put it in a folder and I made the
title pension that's deep
yeah okay so next week we went so yeah

woman touch okay inappropriate jokes
