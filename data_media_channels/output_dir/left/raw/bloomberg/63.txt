1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,580
Picture New York City and you’re probably
thinking about Midtown

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,420
Time Square, the Empire State Building, Grand
Central….

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,260
This is Midtown Manhattan

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,970
Tourist flock to it, while locals often try
- and fail - to avoid it

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,580
But there is more to this part of town than
tourist traps and traffic congestion

6
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,550
Midtown has been electrified by a bolt of
Brooklyn Hip and Wall Street money.

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,420
Maybe it's time you took a second look

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,020
Midtown is everything between 14th street
and Central Park South

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,710
It is the world’s largest central business
district

10
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,050
It also has some of the most expensive real
estate

11
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,430
And it doesn’t get any ritzier than Fifth
Avenue which commands the world's highest

12
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,420
retail rents

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,040
But if there is one building more responsible
than any other for midtown’s success

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,300
it's this one

15
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:21,920
Built in 1913, Grand Central Terminal helped
sparked a boom in construction that made Midtown

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,070
the center of American capitalism

17
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,920
This audacious building is used by more than
one million people a week.

18
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,100
A century after it was built it has only now reached capacity. That’s future proofing

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,470
New York embraces eating out. There are over
45 thousand restaurants in the city

20
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:53,400
It would take 125 years to eat in every one
- not saying your should

21
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,390
Here in Midtown - the restaurant scene is
embracing change

22
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,180
A number of Brooklyn institutions have jumped
the river

23
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,720
Roberta’s pizza started on the other side
of the East River in 2008 but their second

24
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,980
outpost is based in Urbanspace food hall - smack
dab in Midtown

25
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,040
You could be fooled into thinking this is
Williamsburg not Park Avenue

26
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,910
Another Brooklyn import is Ichiran, the Japanese
ramen chain whose first US restaurant opened

27
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,340
in Bushwick in 2016
.

28
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,090
Here you can sit with a group or…. in splendid
isolation in one of the so called ‘flavour

29
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,020
concentration booths’. Very serious

30
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,010
But if you want to swap Brooklyn cool for
something a bit more luxury

31
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,550
we've got the spot

32
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,340
The Office is an intimate speakeasy offering
pre-Prohibition style cocktails and a food

33
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,480
menu to match

34
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:14,220
You’ll find it hidden away on the 35th floor
of the super swanky Mandarin Oriental

35
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:21,470
This is one of the most expensive hotels in
New York, rooms start at $1000 a night

36
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:29,300
But there are 113 other hotels in Midtown
offering plenty of choices

37
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,940
So forget the old wisdom that the excitement
is basically, anywhere but Midtown

38
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,090
.
This part of Manhattan has something new and

39
00:03:37,090 --> 00:00:00,000
exciting to offer, whether it’s high end
or rough-and-ready.
