00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,380
Since the news broke of
Michael Cohen’s guilty plea,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,498
we’ve been getting a
ton of legal questions

3
00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:08,039
from our readers,
and I’m going to try

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,510
to answer some of them.

5
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:17,870
On the one hand,

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,190
impeachment is a
political process.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,200
But if everything
Michael Cohen says

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,140
is true — that the
president instructed him

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,130
to violate
campaign finance laws

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,070
by paying
hush money to women

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,720
who said they had
affairs with him

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,120
in order to influence
the election —

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,990
that is just the
sort of thing

14
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,450
the framers of
the Constitution

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,990
were concerned about.

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,630
And they thought
that interfering

17
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,010
with the integrity
of elections

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,694
could well be an
impeachable offense.

19
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:45,860
Which leads us to our next
question that some of you

20
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,220
were wondering about:

21
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,300
In general,

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,040
for impeachment purposes,

23
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,070
most scholars say that

24
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,310
only the actions of a sitting
president should matter —

25
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,000
that criminal misconduct

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,459
before a president
took office should not

27
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,810
be grounds for impeachment.

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,120
But they make one
exception:

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,722
Did the conduct
cause the president

30
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:15,522
to obtain his office
illicitly and corruptly?

31
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:19,740
And that’s what the Cohen
allegations seem to add up to.

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,720
And one question we
got via Twitter was:

33
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,540
I think they’re basically
surface similarities

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,700
because President Clinton’s
conduct — however ugly

35
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,235
and questionable —
was private conduct.

36
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:40,655
In the Trump case,

37
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,810
if the Michael Cohen
allegations are correct,

38
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,850
you may well have
him corruptly

39
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,240
obtaining his office.

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,990
And that’s much more closely
tied to the presidency

41
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,150
than what was said
about Bill Clinton.

42
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,660
Lastly, one person
asked if

43
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,250
Cohen could be pardoned.

44
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,580
The president can pardon

45
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,920
Michael Cohen if he wishes to.

46
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,870
Were he to pardon somebody
who poses a threat to him,

47
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,490
in a criminal proceeding,

48
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,340
that would be the use
of the president’s office

49
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,890
not to offer clemency
based on neutral grounds —

50
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,440
but on self-interested
grounds.

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,470
And that, too, could

52
00:02:14,470 --> 00:00:00,000
raise the prospect 
of impeachment.
