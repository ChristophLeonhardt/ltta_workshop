my name is Sony from the Bronx and I'm a
ghost
challenges that face on the streets are
pedestrians traffic will seek taxi
drivers hot women that's the problem
I usually deliver envelopes which
contain cash
architecture document and stuff from the
fashion industry
I was hit by a car once I had a broken
wrist for three months but it wasn't
that serious this close calls every day
but at the end of the day you know if
you get up and it's minor just keep it
moving
oh the community for bike messaging is
softe charts
all of us all the messengers we all know
each other we're all friends try to keep
a very tight-knit look out for each
other
try to be more aware of cyclists because
we are everywhere
please look at your mirrors I Drive -
it's not that hard
