nASA has a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> great website called</font>

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,130
NASA NASA technology in your life and if

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,810
you go to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> website you'll you'll be</font>

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,940
amazed at how things that are around you

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,190
every day are actually spin-offs from

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,490
NASA technology obviously as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> push</font>

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,500
technology forward to build lighter

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,779
spacecraft more powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and efficient</font>

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,820
solar panels those are easy kind of

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,350
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say oh yeah I can</font>

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,359
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the space Space Agency is</font>

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,090
involved in that but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure people</font>

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,099
understand that for example deicing

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,308
aircraft nasa and benedict grooves on

15
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,440
runways and roads to make water wick

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,690
away so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're safer NASA invented</font>

17
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,520
that those<font color="#CCCCCC"> little winglets on the end of</font>

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,230
airplanes to make them<font color="#CCCCCC"> more efficient</font>

19
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,980
from NASA the this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe trivial but</font>

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,950
I'm a downhill skier flexible ski boots

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,620
NASA technology am on a more serious

22
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,260
note ninety-five percent of infant

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,180
formulas are supplemented by a

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,680
nutritional supplement that was

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,210
developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help keep the astronauts</font>

26
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,699
healthy up on the International Space

27
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:01,680
Station ninety-five percent of infant

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,349
formulas helping save babies around the

29
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,990
world water purification system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

30
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,670
use on the International Space Station

31
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,070
we've developed a portable version that

32
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,960
we take into disaster zones around the

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,720
world so NASA technology is in your life

34
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,950
every day you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not know it</font>
