<font color="#CCCCCC">fastest I mean I think it's obvious</font>

239
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,320
based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> story but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to make</font>

00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">the meeting oh I didn't have the meeting</font>

340
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">now here's the fifth guy I didn't know</font>

341
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they were a part in the connect to</font>

342
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,120
the Russian government an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

343
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,470
says they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected the Russian</font>

344
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,079
government he says I<font color="#E5E5E5"> love it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so his son</font>

345
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,390
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pathological liar it said but</font>

346
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,250
I did why do I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because after</font>

347
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the meeting</font>

348
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,750
Trump then came out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> said hey if</font>

349
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,450
you've got those<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty thousand emails</font>

350
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hillary deleted Russia send him</font>

351
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">over he wouldn't have said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

352
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> already had the emails or</font>

353
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,399
they already got information<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

354
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">Russians or they already had a good</font>

355
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough connection to that particular</font>

356
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,920
Russian<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting that they just</font>

357
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,440
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I does agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that point</font>

358
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,240
because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think he said send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

359
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,010
over I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he said someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should hack</font>

360
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,810
someone should leak which then

361
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,370
theoretically<font color="#E5E5E5"> regardless if he was ever</font>

362
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,279
involved would say look he called<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it</font>

363
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,589
but he didn't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it was some other</font>

364
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:51,329
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> that did the hacking did the leak</font>

365
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:52,800
yeah that's a big difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

366
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,760
true but but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still the same</font>

367
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,140
thrust of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font>

368
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,260
there is a damage and so so the final

369
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">part is a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of speculation on</font>

370
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">my part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you look more into automation</font>

371
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">this fifth guy and he is apparently by</font>

372
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> masterminded a hacking</font>

373
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,750
scheme great<font color="#CCCCCC"> but he also developed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

374
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,200
special expertise in<font color="#CCCCCC"> running negative</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">public relations campaigns hmm</font>

376
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,730
so they come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Goldstone writes the</font>

377
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,500

384
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,030
