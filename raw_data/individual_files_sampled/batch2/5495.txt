so it didn't take Donald Trump 24 hours after one of the largest news organizations in this country was targeted with a pipe bomb to attack the media Donald Trump now playing the blame game targeting the press for generating quote a very big part of the anger we see today in our society this is the president's response to a potential serial mail bomber who may not be responsible for sending 10 suspicious packages to prominent Democrats and critics of the president those targets now include both Vice President Joe Biden two devices addressed to him were intercepted in Delaware this morning and actor Robert DeNiro a frequent critic of the President as we sit here there's still no suspect and no motive but investigators might have a lead to senior law enforcement officials tell NBC News they're looking into whether some of the packages were mailed from Florida here was Donald Trump with in 12 hours after CNN's New York headquarters were evacuated as part of a larger national effort to bridge our divides and bring people together the media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories have to do and by the way do you see how nice some behaving tonight this is like have you ever seen this we're all behaving very well and hopefully we can keep it that way right we're gonna keep it that way trying to say that very nicely hepatitis C normally I'd scream they want a socialist takeover now I said what's a socialist takeover I'm trying to be nice I already was dead when the American president has to Pat himself on the back for behaving the Washington Post responded to Trump's effort to shift blame from his own vitriolic language to the media that covers him quote Trump again shorts responsibility for his own inflammatory contributions to the political discourse and instead assign blame to others the president who's made a sport out of mocking his political rivals with nicknames like crooked Hillary also exhorted others in the political arena to stop treating their opponents as morally defective here's Donald Trump just this month just this month on his political enemies all of them targeted with bombs this week drugget Heller is a great unifier Maxine Waters good Oh Maxine low IQ individual low IQ you ever see when the fake news interviews them and then they try and cut it but then everybody they'll go to a person holding a son who gets paid by Soros or somebody right that's what happened by the way by the way don't worry I don't like him either okay we call him 1% Biden until Obama took him off the trash heap he couldn't do anything now he's talking about run Tusker morally defective I'll say here to discuss today's developments some of our favorite reporters and friends former US Attorney Joyce Vance from the Washington Post power up anchor Jackie Alemany she also covered Trump's campaign at the table Nick confessori political reporter for The New York Times and Rick Stengel former Undersecretary of State for public diplomacy Steve Schmidt joins us as well Steve let me start with you what's happening in America right now a historic event we haven't seen anything like it since the night Abraham Lincoln was assassinated this was a mass assassination attempt including two former presidents a former vice president of the United States a former attorney General of the United States a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee the person who is responsible for sending bombs to all of those people is the person who mailed the bombs Donald Trump did not mail the bombs but he created the atmosphere where a sick person would look at those individuals and see an enemy Trump makes no pretense about being the commander in chief of all of the country being president of all of the people including the people that voted against him he is in effect a tribal chieftain who has declared war on half of the country when he incites by attacking and stigmatizing vulnerable minority populations alleging conspiracy calling his opponents enemies of the people calling journalists and enemies of the people what is it that we do to enemies how do we deal with an enemy when we invoke martial analogies well we kill enemies and someone out there took him both literally and seriously when you look at a trump rally the venom spewed at the journalists the level of menace the edge of violence his celebrating bodies slams by congressman who physically assaulted a reporter his celebrating supporters who punch opponents in the face every day Donald Trump does everything he can for his own selfish political purposes to inflame and incite and we sit around now and we wonder is there any causation of course there is is there anything that he has done that would create an atmosphere that would instigate or trigger a sick person of course there is and so this idea that Donald Trump is held harmless and not responsible is absurd he has degraded the civility he has exacerbated the divisions more quickly more profoundly than any leader of this country in American history and now we stand at the edge of a we stand on a ragged edge looking into an abyss this is partisan violence this is sectarian violence this is one of the two political tribes targeted by a sick person but a sick person perhaps instigated by a rhetoric that Trump revels in all day every day Steve let me read you something that the New York Times Charles blow writes about on these lines he writes rhetoric mobs and terror Trump said to these people that their enemies were his enemies everyone they saw as a threat to their cultural heritage societal dominance and personal privilege Muslims Mexicans immigrants liberals in general he would attack on their behalf ever the projectionists Trump repeatedly encouraged violence at his campaign rallies and has recently taken to casting Democrats as a mob in fact his supporters are the mob Steve he's a hundred percent correct let's look at the caravan such that it is now whether you think that consideration should be given to allow some of them into the country as refugees or whether you believe that none of them should be allowed into the country the truth of the matter is this is not a Panzer Division advancing on the southern border that's a national security threat to the United States of America but Donald Trump has instigated hatred stoked it by saying that they are and so if you're an unbalanced person out there what is it that you hear you hear that all of these people or enemies they're enemies of Trump they're enemies of the state they're enemies of the people and what they're doing is allowing the country to be invaded by a dangerous horde coming from the South made up of brown people and so the consequences of all of this after two years should not be a surprise to anybody if you in sight and then you incite again if you revel in menace if you stigmatize and declare your opponents as enemies from the highest office in the land the reality is this when the president United States people listen when the president speaks people listen and someone out there took him literally it took him seriously maybe and the result is that we also that we almost saw a couple of presidents a vice president assassinated imagine if the security screenings did not work and yesterday was a day of bloodshed as opposed to a day where these terror attacks and assassinations failed this would have been amongst the most significant days in the history of the United States and but for proper security screenings and the competence of law enforcement there was no disaster but that doesn't mean there won't be next time and the person who is most singularly responsible for edging this country into a cold Civil War is Donald J Trump and it's a shameful legacy that he will carry with him because of that for the rest of his days hey there
