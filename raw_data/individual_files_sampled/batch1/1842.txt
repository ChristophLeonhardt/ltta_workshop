keeping up with a manual macaw isn't easy the energetic young president has thrown himself into a frenzy of activity at home and abroad since being elected in May for this newspaper cartoonist sketching such a dynamic leader is proving quite a challenge what's amazing is that we never used to draw him two years ago people talked about Emmanuel Michael as a young prodigy close to President Hollande but he was never comunist as that we never drew him now is the president but it was really during the election campaign that we started sketching him a lot because he was everywhere macarons built a reputation in France as a straight talker and a man of action it's why many in France call him a hyper president a phrase which was used to describe former president Nicolas Sarkozy's hands-on style many don't handle everday mackerels taken a lead on climate change and reforming the European Union he's pushed through a raft of domestic reforms looting plans to help convey a very clear message of hope but not a name one of the strong commitment for Emanuel McCaw has also been very active internationally he's taken a keen interest in crises such as Lebanon Syria and Jerusalem he wants France to play a greater role what he is somebody who's very quick to size up opportunities and when he sees opportunities he takes them we saw that with the election last year and we're seeing that now with him as president and what he senses now is there's an opportunity internationally to take on a bigger role I mean at the start of his term macros popularity was low some in France said he was too arrogant but that's changed he's now higher in the opinion polls than any previous leader in their first year Crimea he's doing very well he has refreshed French politics he's pragmatic intelligent not an ideologue he's what France needs right now people want to change micro fulfills that need for change we cannot tell now if succeed it's early but for the time being he delivers what he promised but not everyone is convinced some say he needs to delegate more to his ministers he's an omnipresent president he wants to be in charge of everything all the time but that's very dangerous he's up in the polls now sure but when things go wrong he'll be the one directly in the firing line and the one who will have to take the blame the French won't always support him Mackrell says France was stagnating and he wants to restore its glory as his political party has nearly wiped out the opposition it seems that for now there is very little standing in the way of his ambitions Latasha Butler al Jazeera Paris
