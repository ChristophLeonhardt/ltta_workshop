Trish: HERE NOW DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ERIC SWALLOW OF CALIFORNIA. GOOD TO HAVE YOU. GOOD EVENING. Trish: WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO ALL THIS? WELL, I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES BUT I DON'T KNOW THE SENATOR IS SUGGESTING THE COST OF LOSING AN ELECTION IS TO PUT ON A SUPREME COURT SOMEONE WHO HAS SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS GENG HIM WHERE THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS AND ASTERISKS ON THE NOMINATION. THE RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO IS PUT TO BED ALL OF THOSE ALLEGATIONS. Trish: CONGRESSMAN, I HEAR YOU BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO WHY WE DIDN'T KNOW THIS EARLIER. WE TALKED TO OUR POLLSTER WHO TOLD US LOOK, THE INDEPENDENTS ARE FED UP WITH THIS. THEY BLAME BOTH SIDES AND THEY DON'T LIKE THAT IT GOT TO THIS POINT. THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FAIR TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH. THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FAIR TO DR. FORD. I WOULD TELL YOU IT WASN'T FAIR TO THE COUNTRY TO SEE THAT. AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED HAD THE DEMOCRATS WHO HAD THE INFORMATION FROM DR. FORD COME FORWARD AND TOLD OUR PRESIDENT SO THE PROCESS COULD HAVE BEEN I DON'T KNOW, COMPREHENSIVE WHEN THEY DID THIS INVESTIGATION. SO THAT AT LEAST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO PLAY OUT ON NATIONAL TV LIKE IT DID. HOW COME IT DIDN'T? YEAH. I HEAR THAT CONCERN. I'LL SAY THIS. AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS AS PROSECUTOR, EVERY VICTIM COMES FORWARD OR DOESN'T COME FORWARD AT ALL IN A DIFFERENT MANNER. I GUESS YOU WOULD ASK Trish: BUT SHE DID COME FORWARD. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE EXPOSED. SHE DIDN'T WANT HER IDENTITY LEAKED. SHE CAME FORWARD AND IT WAS FEINSTEIN WHO KNEW ABOUT THIS, HER CONGRESSWOMAN WHO KNEW ABOUT IT. DON'T FORGET, CONGRESSMAN, SHE TRIED TO ALERT PEOPLE. RIGHT? SHE ALERTED THE "WASHINGTON POST" AND ALERTED THE CONGRESSWOMAN'S OFFICE AND SENT A LETTER AND SPOKE TO THE RECEPTIONIST. SHE WAS TRYING TO GET THE WORD OUT BEHIND THE SCENES. NOBODY CARED. NOT UNTIL HE WAS NAMED. PEOPLE CERTAINLY CARED BUT I'D SAY THIS. WOULD YOU PREFER SHE NEVER HAD COME FORWARD AT ALL IF IT WAS TRUE? SHE CAME FORWARD. ONCE SHE DID THE PAST IS THE PAST WE SHOULD TAKE HER ALLEGATION SERIOUSLY. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE REPUBLICANS AREN'T TRUSTING YOU GUYS, RIGHT? BUT I SAY THIS. I MADE THIS ARGUMENT TO MANY JUROR TO MANY JURIES. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT THIS WOMAN AND TWO OTHER WOMEN WHO NEVER MET EACH OTHER COME FORWARD WITH SIMILAR ACCUSATIONS? IT'S UNLIKELY. I COULD BE THAT HE IS UNLUCKIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD BUT HE SHOULD INVESTIGATE. Trish: I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT COULD BE. ANYTHING, RIGHT? WE START SPECULATING LIKE THAT IT GETS THAT'S WHY WE INVESTIGATE. THAT IS WHY WE INVESTIGATE. Trish: I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS. KAMALA HARRIS HAD BASICALLY WASHED HER HANDS OF THE WHOLE SITUATION. AND I WANT YOUR REACTION. PLAY IT FOR THE VIEWERS. THIS IS A SHAM WHAT IS GOING ON IN THERE RIGHT NOW. DEMOCRATS ARE NOT HEARD. THEY ARE PUSHING THROUGH THE PROCESS. THE STATEMENTS YESTERDAY WERE ABOUT BULLYING THE FELLOW SENATORS. FROM TOP TO BOTTOM, THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT BULLIES. Trish: I SHOULD POINT OUT SHE DID STORM OUT OF THE SESSION. SHE WAS DONE. SHE WASHED HER HANDS OF IT AND SHE WAS DONE AND GOT OUT THERE AND FED THAT INFORMATION TO THE REPORTERS AND THE CAMERAS. I WOULD POINT OUT, CONGRESSMAN THAT YESTERDAY, SHE DIDN'T LEAVE A WHOLE LOT OF TIME FOR DR. FORD TO TALK. SHE SPOKE AND SPOKE AND SPOKE ABOUT HOW AWFUL THIS WAS AND HOW SHE BELIEVED HER AND SOMEHOW IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S FAULT. IT WAS GRANDSTANDING IN A WAY THAT FRANKLY WAS NOT BENEFICIAL TO ANYONE INCLUDING HER. WHY IS THE PARTY LIKE THAT NOW? WE COME FROM THE SAME DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. I WOULD SAY I WOULD HAVE BEEN UPSET, TOO. RIGHT BEFORE SHE WALKED OUT THEY MOVED TO SUBPOENA MARK JUDGE. THE ALIBI WITNESS FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO HEAR FROM THAT PERSON AND PUT HIM UNDER OATH AS YOU PUT DR. FORD UNDER OATH. I WILL SAY THIS, TRISH. 27 YEARS AGO WHEN ANITA HILL CAME FORWARD MOST PEOPLE AGREE IT WAS A DISGRACE. BUT 20 WITNESSES WERE HEARD AT THAT HEARING. WE HAVE ACTUALLY GONE BACKWARD WHEN ONLY TWO WITNESSES ARE HEARD AND THEY PUT FORWARD THE NOMINATION WITHOUT CONSIDERING ANY OTHER EVIDENCE. SO YOU THINK HE IS LYING? I WOULDN'T HIRE HIM BUT I'D LOOK MORE INTO THIS. Trish: SORRY, YOU WOULDN'T HIRE HIM? THIS IS A JOB INTERVIEW. THEY ARE ADVISING AND CONSENTING AND ESSENTIALLY HIRING OR NOT HIRING JUDGE KAVANAUGH. I'M NOT DETERMINING WHETHER HE DID THIS OR NOT. I WOULD SAY Trish: NOR AM I. BUT DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR THAT 36 YEARS AFTER SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT SOMEONE'S ENTIRE CAREER COULD POTENTIALLY BE DESTROYED BECAUSE OF ALLEGATIONS WHICH NOBODY HAS ANY PROOF OVER? I THINK THE FAIREST THING FOR JENG JUDGE KAVANAUGH HE TOOK THE BENCH HAVING HIS NAME CLEARED BY A THOROUGH F.B.I. INVESTIGATION.
