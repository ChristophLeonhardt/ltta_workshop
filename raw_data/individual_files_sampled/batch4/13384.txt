ok so we begin today with samantha bee samantha bee you'll recall just about a week ago she got herself in hot water because she suggested that Ivanka Trump the president of the the president's daughter the daughter of the President of the United States was a feckless c-word why because Ivanka Trump had the temerity the utter gall the unmitigated sort of audacity to put up a picture of herself with her kid and in doing so she then had somehow offended the left because the left was all concerned about children being separated from their parents at the border which is an operation of law as ruled by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals so Samantha P goes on national TV and she calls Monica Trump affectless c-word and then she suggests that a Monica Trump should actually go try to have sex with her father in order to get him to change immigration policy which is just wonderful excellent stuff well Samantha bee was off for the rest of the week after that well she was back last night and she was gonna give her apology now well here's the wonderful thing about apologies from the left if you're on the left you know that there's that old that old movie love story where the slogan was being in love means never having to say you're sorry love means never having to say you're sorry okay well being on the Left means never having to say you're sorry laura ingraham had to put out like a full apology for saying the david hog a parkland survivor was whiny about his college admissions and she got boycotted for that samantha be called the daughter of the President of the United States a feckless c-word and suggested she should try to dress sexy to seduce her own dad and then she goes on TV and does a like seven minute quasi apology that is not apology in the slightest and of course the media are letting her off the hook and they're saying that she is just an emissary of genius she is just an emissary of goodness she's an emissary of rightness so here's Samantha bee who it will be noted has not said a funny thing in years right the last time she was funny wasn't she's actually just the sidekick on The Daily Show now she's not funny at all now she goes for what we like to call clapped her in the business it's not laughter it's where everybody goes right and then there's kind of like a couple of laughs and they're not really laughing tomorrow like smiles and clapping because you agree with the person you know just like you're doing right now at this show it's like that except I'm not a comedian Samantha bee is a professional comedian okay so here's Samantha bee here's her quasi apology that is not an apology at all last night on TV and of course she'll just go right back to business because that's the way it works if you're on the left then you get some clapped her and people pretend that you didn't do anything wrong if you're on the right then we cancel your show or we boycott you and even if you apologize we say that is insufficient even if you are clearly mentally ill as a Roseanne Barr is obviously Samantha P gets to go on with her life like nothing happened and lecture us in the process it's my favorite part it's Samantha bee lecturing me I'm not the one who went on national television and called someone a feckless c-word and suggested they had incest with their own father that wasn't me you know Samantha bee but she's gonna lecture me and she's gonna lecture Republicans because Republicans who are really bad how do we know that well because they're Republicans that's how we know they're bad I guess a here is the execrable Samantha P who has I will say walked away well I've been saying for more than a year now that there was a running gun battle between a series of leftist comedians to be the least funny comedian on the left and that included Amy Schumer and that included Lena Dunham and then included Trevor Noah and it included Samantha bee but Samantha bee I mean she is now Secretariat she's just busting out of the pack she is it she's eight lengths ahead nobody else is even in camera view here's Samantha bee doing her apology last night you know a lot of people were offended and angry that I used an epithet to describe the president's daughter and advisor last week it is a word I have used on the show many times hoping to reclaim it this time I used it as an insult I crossed the line I regret it and I do apologize for that the problem is that many women have heard that word at the worst moments of their lives a lot of them don't want that word reclaimed they want it gone and I don't blame them I don't want to inflict more pain on them I want this show to be challenging and I want it to be honest but I never intended it to hurt anyone okay composite for a second you never intended it to hurt anyone every day on the show she calls someone off on them like an awful name that I would never use she does it every single night on her show like all the time and when she suggests that she's trying to reclaim the c-word this is the same sort of stupid logic that I hear with regard to people who use the n-word I'm trying to reclaim the n-word and make it a term of empowerment why why don't you say it's a bad word people shouldn't use it right the n-word is such a bad word and we're not even allowed to say the full n-word which seems to me appropriate I feel like the c-word is the same sort of thing I've never tried to reclaim the kay ward I don't go around at Scholl and my synagogue saying the K word to people you know it sweet let's reclaim this this slur that's been used against Jews for a century instead let's talk let's say to each other man I mean let's reclaim that thing publicly what's up Mike a word like I wouldn't do that because that's idiotic as I mentioned last week I wouldn't do that like Jess is this something you're doing you're committed to justice Hispanic so Jess do you run do you run around your community calling each other the S word I assume not that's probably not a thing right like people don't do this on a regular basis because it's idiotic okay this is just an excuse that she's making for being a nasty person who likes to use the c-word publicly and then she gets to claim it's all about empowerment she continues along these lines Samantha bee boy many men were also offended by my use of the word I do not care about that that's hilarious hey distracted from more important issues I hate that I did something to contribute to the nightmare of 24-hour news cycles that were all white knuckling I should have known that a potty mouth insult would be inherently more interesting to them than juvenile immigration policy I would do anything to help those kids I hate that this distracted from them so to them I am also sorry okay you stop right there okay so her real apology is that she did something distracted from the underlying issue that was the whole point for making the joke okay she's a smart lady Samantha B she knows exactly what she was doing when she went on national TV and suggested that a vodka Trump was a feckless c-word she knew exactly what was going to happen this went through writers it went through producers it was on the teleprompter she's reading from a teleprompter right now she doesn't have all the stuff memorized obviously this is just silliness and when she says I'm so sorry to distract I should have known I shouldn't have contribute to the 24-hour news cycle she wanted to make news and so she said this okay it is that simple this is obviously more heard attempting to make news than Roseanne Barr tweeting something out that was execrable that valerie jarrett like Roseanne Barr on on Twitter is a nut job this was scripted right this was something that was produced so I don't buy this excuse making at all and also by the way this idea that I can't be offended for use of the c-word why not I'm offended when somebody uses the n-word because vile uncivil disgusting behavior is vile uncivil disgusting behavior no matter at whom it is directed I thought that we're supposed to live in a society where if you see somebody use the c-word against some inappropriately we're supposed to step in and say no I thought that was a good thing I thought I'm supposed to be offended on behalf of people who are being maligned I mean isn't that what makes for a better society I guess now the idea is that if I'm a man I can't object if a woman uses the c-word even if she's calling another woman the c-word I just I don't buy that at all I think it's it's idiotic logic but she continues with her non-apology apology which the media will label brave obviously if you are worried about the death of civility don't sweat it I'm a comedian people who hone their voices in basement bars while yelling back at drunk hecklers are definitely not Paragons of civility I am I'm really sorry that I said that word but you know what civility is just nice words maybe we should all worry a little bit more about the niceness of our actions okay just one point you just want to point this out for one second she says that we should worry about the niceness of our actions rather than the contents of our words okay well let's say that that's the case why are you so pissed about everything Trump says all the time then right this is obviously not true why are you so angry about what Roseanne Barr says it turns out that words are kind of actions sometimes that doesn't mean they're violence it doesn't mean that they are a kind of thing that has an impact in the world and pretend that words are all created equal or that whatever we say has no impact 'silly not doesn't mean they should be restricted it doesn't mean that every word should be met with any sort of action it doesn't mean any of those things but to suggest that you are going to make a hard divide between stuff we say and stuff we do well I think that applies in certain contexts that certainly doesn't apply to Samantha B's job whose entire job is to stand in front of a camera and say words it's not like she's going out there you know handing out teddy bears at the border Samantha B's entire job is to say words into a camera that are written for her on a screen that moves before her right I mean that that is her entire job and Chava doesn't apply this logic to anybody on the right if I were to say the same thing Samantha bee did she'd be calling for my firing tomorrow because that's what that's what people on the Left do so this sort of double standard is really quite absurd in every way she concludes with with a little bit more of this non-apology apology which the media cheered all the way listen I wanted to introduce you to some exciting new additions to our show these are our new mandatory censors who will be with us from now on don't be jittery guys I talk fast but you'll be fine that's right they're the best channel for news centers in the entire business unfortunately this is what we have to do from now on I know I know it's some pretty big stuff ok so this is the new thing is that she's gonna pretend that she's being censored in some way she hasn't been censored in any way TBS is allowing her to go on there and if she wants to say feckless see where tomorrow they'll do that too it is worth noting by the way that her ratings stink Samantha B's ratings stink as well they should because she is not good at this job but if you look at the posters all around town so I live in LA which means that you see Emmy posters everywhere all the time right you're driving around you see how the bus stop there's an Emmy poster for Samantha B and there is this hilarious thing that's going on right now or Trevor Noah has a bunch of his Emmy posters that are up and it features a quote from Samantha bee and then Samantha people put her Emmy poster up and it will feature a quote from Trevor Noah and then Jimmy Kimmel will put one up and it features quotes from Samantha B and Jimmy and Trevor Noah and they all have quotes about each other because they're all part of this ideological bubble we're saying stuff like Samantha bee says is not offensive in any way the only people who would be offended of course are these rubes out in the middle of the country who still think it's bad to say the c-word about people now again I'm not gonna do the what about ism thing and point out here that there are people who said the c-word about Hillary Clinton which I thought was wrong at the time on its face but Samantha bee is a who is a thought leader and that ought to make some sort of difference it won't according to the left-wing media okay so I want to talk a little bit about Ben Rhodes who is out there making some insane claims about how your control of information should be about how your information that you see can be controlled first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at Indo Chino so you're never gonna look better dudes than you do in a nice suits okay there's a reason James Bond is always

so much of our information from the media we get so much of what we see from the media and that means that what we see is automatically filtered and Ben Rhodes wants that filter to be even higher so in the aftermath of 2016 when the Democrats were utterly stunned by the victory of President Trump they suggested that what needs to change is the way that information gets to us right the big problem is that we had information that was not filtered by the proper sources so Ben Rhodes a man who as the national security adviser to the President of the United States Barack Obama openly said that he had created an echo chamber for information in which he put out false information about the Iranian regime this guy says the government should ensure that Facebook feeds should be controlled by the government I mean this is an amazing thing what Ben Rose is about say here's what he said on MSNBC and frankly the government also didn't have a lot of capacity to deal with this yeah we can't edit people's Facebook feeds and say that's fake news and that's not and and what worries me today Andrea is that we still don't have a lot of capacity and frankly our governments probably not doing anything to prevent this and so the likelihood that the Russians are going to do this again in the midterm elections in the next presidential election is very hot okay so he thinks that the government should now have more control over what it is that we can see whether this is that we he this guy who used the power of government to crack down on what the American people could see and lied about it to the effect that now Iran a terror sponsored the greatest terrorist bouncer on planet earth has billions of extra dollars to pass down in pursuit of that terrorism he thinks the government should be in charge of what we see the same people who find Samantha be funny we want to control what you see that's the bottom line the same people who think that Samantha B is some sort of Halcyon of feminism that's just some sort of apex of free speech being utilized for truth these same people think that you ought to not be able to see my show for example on Facebook but amantha B's show should be featured in fact Facebook is starting this is a new thing they're starting their their new watch feed their watch feed is a bunch of shows that Facebook helps produce and they're all from mainstream media outlets right Facebook is not coordinating with a bunch of right-wing outlets and according with Daily wire to put out a various divert a very since sundry show with diverse points of view they're not doing that instead they're picking a few mainstream outlets and they're going to promote those mainstream outlets because Democrats have said that they should do so and then they wonder why we on the right are worried about the distribution of information we have a reason to be worried about the distribution of information now speaking of the distribution of information there's a story that's trending on Twitter that I want to talk about briefly so there's a story that was going around today and it was it says no gazel out right this is what's trending on Twitter his no gays allowed so what's the story the story is that there was a guy in in Tennessee who apparently put up a sign right he put up a sign that said no gays allowed in his store and he put up the sign after there is the Supreme Court ruling that said that religious bakers no longer have to cater to same-sex weddings or at least this particular religious Baker does not have to cater to a same-sex wedding and it was reported by USA Today as though this had just happened the owner of the store is a guy named Jeff Amex and he said the Lord told me to he told me to stand it goes against my religion what I believe I'll never accept it and then he replaced the sign with something said we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who would violate our freedom of speech and freedom of religion and everybody on the Left went off on this John Fugelsang said homophobic no gays allowed sign point up put up by homophobic Tennessee store to show devotion to noted non homophobe Jesus first of all it's not that Jesus was a homophobe per se but it's not that the New Testament is super Pro homosexuality I mean Romans is not particularly pro homosexuality there there are various places in the New Testament that demonstrate that they are not Pro homosexuality Peter Dow who used to work for Helena Clinton he says Tennessee hardware store owner puts up no gays allowed sign and claims I'm gonna take more persecution than them because I'm standing for what I believe in okay and then there's another story that came out right and then and then he tweeted out the story and then there was another various tweets coming out from people on the Left Charles blow who's who's appropriately named over the New York Times and he tweeted out the same stories had boys boy gays are everywhere probably even a ston staffer you put that a card we're store not everyone flies a flag Tennessee hardware store puts up no gays allowed sign okay there's only one problem with the story that all these people are tweeting out its from 2015 okay this guy put up his sign again apparently this week but the original sign was put up in 2015 so the whole story here is that there's a nutcase in Tennessee who put up with no gays allowed sign in 2015 and then took it down within one day and now he's put it up again and we're supposed to believe there's a broad swath of Christians across the country who are no longer going to serve gay customers because of all of this now I'll be honest with you I don't know one Christian who owns a store who's not going to serve a gay customer I know a lot of Christians who aren't interested in catering a same-sex wedding or being involved with something they perceived to be a sin but I don't know any Christians who operate a normal business who do a sex orientation check or sexual orientation check at the counter I've never seen that ever but the media are gonna focus in on that because the media want to push a particular narrative and that narrative is that in the absence of government compulsion Christians everywhere are going to be putting up no gays allowed signs in their stores again this story originated three years ago and it's the same guy doing the same thing but we're now going to pretend that it's something brand-new and shocking because the media have something to push because the media have something that they need to that they need to show now I'll be honest at this originally when we reported the story we only reported the part about 2015 that was a mistake on my behalf over a Daily wire it's a mistake I made while I was reporting the story we updated the story to correct it and to demonstrate the guy who had put back up the sign but it doesn't undermine the original critique which is that if you're going to claim that this is happening all over the country you can't pick the same guy who does this every three years and then say oh my god something brand-new is happening we see this sort of media coverage unfortunately across the board in California there's a guy who's running out here for I believe it was a state Senate seat or the governor's seat and he was he was a a fellow who was a neo-nazi essentially and there was one outlying poll that showed him at double digits in the outlying polls and it turned out that he won one point eight percent of the total vote but four weeks was non-stop coverage about how this was the new upswing inside the Republican Party how this person presented a serious dire threat to the state of America now listen I think bad people are bad people and they ought to be called out when they're bad people that's fine with me but to pretend that there is some broad conspiracy some broad swath of people who are jumping on board here and that all of America's Christians are going to put up no gays allowed signs so that all of America's Republicans are actual secret Nazis there's an agenda that is happening and that's why when Ben Rhodes says things like the government ought to control your informational feed the same people who are fibbing about this stuff the same people who are exaggerating these cases to make them into a big deal those same people are saying that they ought to control the flow of information that I find utterly and completely disturbing now speaking of things that I find utterly and completely disturbing in just a second I want to talk about the Kim Kardashian pardon because I know there's a lot of people on the right who are very fond of this Kim Kardashian pardon it wasn't Kim Kardashian whose partner she didn't commit a crime but she was involved with a pardon and I won't explain why I find this somewhat troubling in just a second first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at helix sleep so there's nobody on the

and let them know that we say you okay so a lot of people are very very excited because yesterday president from commuted the sentence for a woman named Alice Johnson so Alice Johnson is a 63 year old grandmother this is what you will hear in all the headlines she's a 63 year old grandmother and as a 63 year old grandmother she ought to have been let out of prison here is my problem so President Trump has been rather inconsistent on the drug war I am somebody who is pretty libertarian on drugs I think that marijuana particularly ought to be decriminalized I don't think you should go to jail for for smoking marijuana or dealing marijuana I am not quite as certain about opioids because opioids actually rob people of their capacity to think in a pretty spectacular way that undermines the very basis of their republic so I'm a little more torn on harder drugs like opioids or for example cocaine Trump has not been torn on any of this right Trump has actually said in the past that he wants the death penalty for drug dealers here's him in a rally like a month and a half ago talking about how he wants the death penalty for drug dealers but if we don't get tough on the drug dealers we're wasting our time just remember that we're wasting our time and that toughness includes the death penalty so I'm going to point out here is the inconsistency if you want to actually say that the drug war needs to be taken off the table we need to change our laws drug dealers should not go to jail for quite as long once he at the age of 60 we should think about releasing whatever it is if you want to actually make a substantive policy change that is one thing what actually happened yesterday is that President Trump decided to release a drug dealer a drug trafficker her name is Alice Johnson and Kim Kardashian was of course extraordinarily happy about this she tweeted out a bunch of stuff about Alice Johnson so grateful to Donald Trump Jared Kushner and to everyone who has showed compassion and contributed countless hours to this important moment for miss Alice Marie Johnson her commutation is inspirational and gives hope to so many others who are also deserving of a second chance and she continued along these lines she said I hope to continue this important work by working together with organizations who have been fighting this fight for much longer than I haven't deserved the recognition and then she concluded the phone call I just had with Alice will forever be one of my best memories telling her for the first time and hearing her screams while crying together is a moment I will never forget okay and then there's this video going around yesterday of Alice Johnson being released from prison and here is what it sounded like all right so we are going to hear from you see there miss Johnson being reunited with her friends and her family they made that trip to meet her earlier this afternoon we heard this was going to happen to a couple of hours or so for some of the logistics to be worked out but then she was released okay so then Alice Johnson came out and praised President Trump said thank you to President Trump I'm gonna give you the rest of the story in just a second I will not disappoint the world so much faithfully oh thank you okay so here is the issue that I have with this the issue that I have with this is if you had said when President Trump was elected that he was going to go around pardoning drug dealers based on visits from Kim Kardashian I think a lot of his base would have been unhappy because he was the tough on crime guy now again if you want to change overall policy with regard to the drug war I think that's probably a very good idea the drug war has been a giant failed that it sucked trillions of dollars from the American economy I'm fine with that but the notion that President Trump is now going to be granting pardons like he would on the apprentice that now we're gonna have the pardon show and that's basically what it's become some nights on Fox where you have George papadopolis his wife going on Fox News and begging President Trump for pardon and you have Rod Blagojevich's wife going on Fox News and begging President Trump for a pardon and now it becomes The Apprentice where Trump just sits there at the end of a table and instead of firing people he pardons people I'm not a big fan of this I don't like celebrity mergers with politics okay president here's the problem okay Alice Johnson maybe she's a good candidate for a lease but I'm not sure why she's a specifically good candidate for a lease she's a 63 year old woman okay she aged right there happened she they say she's a grandmother right that tends to happen when you have kids when you go to jail you become a grandmother okay being a grandmother is not a status you control being old is not a status you control now she's been on a good behavior maybe she should be paroled there's no parole in the federal system maybe that needs to change right maybe there should be changes to the actual criminal justice system maybe there should be criminal justice reform but that's not the same thing as president Trump basically saying on the one hand let's strengthen the drug war and on the other hand saying let's let a drug trafficker out of prison by the way this idea that she was uniquely innocent or something is just insane she was sentenced in 1996 to life in prison why because she was leading a multi-million dollar cocaine ring trafficking in 2002 3,000 kilograms in involvement with the deadly Colombian Cali drug cartel the judge in that case who now by the way sits on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and was confirmed to that seat by 95 to nothing vote in the Senate called Johnson quote the quintessential entrepreneur cocaine trafficking ends with dead people on both ends of the business so we don't know how many people died because this woman trafficked in 2002 3,000 kilograms of cocaine but here's how all of this started Mike comm made a video about her and they said does this grand mother deserve a life sentence and then they didn't really talk about her crime and Johnson told her story to CNN she said after almost two decades together in a tumultuous relationship my husband and I divorced in 1989 it was during this time that my life began to spiral out of control I lost my job and then my young youngest son was tragically killed in a motorcycle accident no mother should have to bury her child the weight was unbelievable it was a burden I couldn't sustain I made some very poor decisions out of desperation I want to make this part of clear I acknowledge I have done wrong I made the biggest mistake of my life to make ends meet and got involved with people selling drugs well she didn't get involved with people selling drugs she was the quintessential entrepreneur running the drugs hey you didn't get it wasn't like some sort of accident so all this talk about she has accepted her guilt and all the rest of it again maybe let her out because she's old and she writes plays and she's not likely to go back to drug dealing after all of this but if you're going to make the case that you need to be harsher on drug penalties then I'm not sure how you make that case simultaneous with oh she was a victim she wasn't the victim she got involved in drug dealing herself that was it she's a sentient human being and if you want to change the sand or change the standard but don't change it just because Kim Kardashian showed up and this is a bigger issue okay I think right now we are in the midst of something that I think is is deeply stupid and that is treating our celebrities like politicians you know in some cases maybe that's ended up as a good thing right president Trump has has done some good things as president of the United States but right now we are ignoring actual missin necessity for expertise in politics on behalf of people who are famous so it's not that President Trump met with a bunch of criminal justice reform advocates and then decided based on the weight of the evidence there was time to release Alice Johnson and restructure criminal justice reform instead it was Kim Kardashian came to the White House he'd sim come he'd seen him Kim Kardashian maybe in a sex tape or something and then he decided you know it'd be great is I will let her I will let her pick the next person that I pardon so there was that and then we also had this week the whole hub up with the Philadelphia Eagles and Steph Curry and LeBron James talking about politics and then we had that story that I discussed a couple of days ago that Medicare and Social Security are gonna bankrupt in the next 15 years which one of those stories got the least attention obviously it's the one about Social Security but that there's a reason for that it's because human beings are pre-programmed to have an addiction to celebrity we care about what

overcoming our own inherent biases right we are born of certain biases our brains are not completely plastic we are born with certain biases babies already discriminate against out-groups babies tend to be violent right wewe have to as we become older and more rational use our rational capacity to overcome those instinctive biases that we have when one of those instincts that we've not paid a lot of attention to but we really ought to pay attention to is our worship of celebrity it makes sense right if you're in a small group there are dominance hierarchies as jordan peterson would put it dominance hierarchies in smaller groups dominance hierarchies just means somebody's the winner and somebody's the loser and Stern the animal kingdom it's true among human beings there's always somebody at the top of the food chain and because we were evolved to live in these small groups that means that we look at the person at the top of the dominance hierarchy and we pay special attention to them because when they give cues then that may allow us more survival mechanisms if that if we are nice to the person at the top of dominance hierarchy if we imitate the person at the top of the dominance hierarchy if we pay attention to the person at the top of the dominance hierarchy well now take that small scale social group and expand that out to 300 million people the dominance hierarchy still exists but the way that we judge dominance is fame and fortune right wealth and and being famous that's how we judge who's at the top of the dominance hierarchy and so without us even really understanding us understanding it we have essentially this vestigial vestigial evolutionary overhang where we still care what people at the top of the so-called dominance hierarchy think and Men and we're and all of these things because we're evolved to do that at small group level and now we do it a large group level even though Kim Kardashian has no actual impact on our lives even though LeBron James and Steph Curry have no actual impact on our lives I mean this is not me suggesting this this is evolutionary psychologist Daniel Kruger at University of Michigan well now that addiction to the celebrity has infected our politics because yep there's another bias that human beings suffer from so we suffer from a bias toward celebrity a bias toward the person at the top of the dominance hierarchy and then there's something called the halo effect the halo effect is if I see somebody beautiful I also tend to think that person is smart if I see somebody beautiful I think that person is nice if I think that / if I see somebody rich that person must be nice and also better looking right this is just the way the human brain works we tend to attribute all good qualities to one person to whom we have attributed one good quality so I mean look at celeb we think oh they must know things but the line from fiddler on the roof is when you're rich they think you really know well it's basically correct when people are very wealthy I want to go our very famous we tend to think they know what they're talking about and that holds true even when it's pretty obvious they don't actually know what they're talking about as we take Samantha be seriously even though she doesn't know what she's talking about and we'd treat roseanne barr as though she's a political tribal leader even though Roseanne Barr doesn't know anything about politics and is extraordinarily volatile with a history of mental illness well president Trump is in is sort of a beneficiary of our worship of celebrity and maybe that's had some good impacts in terms of policy but it is not good policy making the reason being that in the end when you're making policy for 330 million people when you're trying to determine the best policy with the fewest trade-offs well you actually need our people who have studied these issues and when you're talking about crucial issues like bankruptcy and Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid going to Kim Kardashian for this stuff is not the right way to do it and the same thing holds true on criminal justice reform I'm very interested to hear what people who have studied criminal justice reform from right and left have said about this stuff I'm interested to hear what Heather McDonald has had to say about this sort of issue I'm interested to hear what some of the experts who've been put forward by the Trump administration in favor of criminal justice reform have to hear about the I have to say about the issue I think they're good debates to be had about these issues I don't think that those debates can be had at the level of Kim Kardashian's said we ought to let a drug trafficker out of prison I don't think that's the way that politics ought to be done but if we pay attention to experts that's more boring it's more in fulfilling here's what's what's really interesting about the way our government works right now on the one level it is a celebrity government where we care about the president inviting the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House and on another level we pay no attention to the actual experts the actual experts are the quote-unquote bureaucrats or inside the executive branch who don't elect her to select that was not the way the founders envisioned this stuff the way the founders envisioned this stuff is the experts were the legislators that we elect we elected the experts those were the people whom we were supposed to pay attention to those were the people who are supposed to be answerable to us so now we've got the boat the worst of both worlds we've got celebrities who we don't elect who are influencing people that we do elect who aren't paying attention to the experts and we have experts that we don't elect then we're not engaging in debate with so what we have is experts completely disconnected from the public celebrities completely disconnected from the public and the only people who are connected to the public are then kicking the ball - either celebrities or the experts none of this is good for the way that the country works now you may like the Alice Johnson the Alice Johnson pardon that's fine I'm not like freaking out it's not a pardon it's a commutation I'm not freaking out about it I don't think it's the worst thing that ever happened I don't think it's the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination but I do not like the I do not like the the basic notion here that we should spend all of our time paying attention to what celebrities think I think it just makes for bad policy now speaking of that the the US Senate has is considering right now the possibility of scaling back the White House's capacity to put tariffs on foreign products I think this is about time I think it's beyond time senator bob Corker who really is not a fan of the president the president is not a fan of his he's put forward a bill to curtail presidential power on trade apparently Trump called him and a lengthy call and told him to lay off the legislation and then corker said that he was going to move forward with the legislation anyway as a general rule I think the Legislature should be in charge of tariffs it's not the job of the President of the United States to unilaterally decide misusing federal statutory law when we ought to be putting taxes on our own citizens tariffs are a tax if you tax products coming from China you are forcing Americans to pay more for that product than her China that much it hurts the United States a lot the fact is that it hurts China and the sense China can't ship products to us but it hurts the American consumer - it's a tax on the American consumer now if you're using tariffs in order to ratchet down Chinese tariffs on American products that's one thing if you're doing it just because you like tariffs and you think it makes America more competitive and trade wars are easy to win as the president has suggested that is in another thing entirely again just because President Trump is the president doesn't mean he knows what he's talking about when it comes to trade policy this should be kicked back to the Senate the fact that Republican senators are shying away from this shows their absolute cowardice on these issues this was a senatorial prerogative this is not a presidential prerogative I would be saying this no matter who is president of the United States in any circumstance okay so in just a second I want to give you the update on them on the Moller Pro because there are a couple of updates that are worth noting here so let's begin with an update on James Comey so James Comey who is just a self-serving self-aggrandizing human being I've been very critical of James Comey I think he ought have been fired by Obama I thought he ought have been fired by Trump before Trump even came into office I said so at the time well now according to ABC News the Justice Department's internal watchdog has concluded that James coming to fight authority at times during his tenure as FBI director according to sources familiar with the draft report of the matter shocked him one source told ABC News that the draft report explicitly used the word insubordinate to describe Cummings behavior another source agreed with that characterization but could not confirm the use of the term in the draft report inspector general Michael Horowitz who is an apolitical body like the IG the Aichi's portion of the DOJ is not supposed to be political also rebukes a former attorney general Loretta Lynch for her handling of the federal investigation into Hillary Clinton's personal email server according to sources on Tuesday morning president Trump complained of numerous delays in the release of Horowitz his final report which is expected to run several hundred pages long and be released in the coming days the sources who spoke to ABC News were willing or able to address only a portion of the draft reports complete findings what is taking so long with the inspector general's report on crooked Hillary and slippery James Comey Trump said on Twitter hope report is not being changed and made weaker well there's no indication that the president has seen or will see a draft of the report before it's released but Horowitz could theoretically revise the report before it is released I'll be obviously very curious to see what the IG report says I'm of the opinion that Comey was a terrible terrible head of the FBI I don't find any of this particularly shocking you know with all of that said the the fact is that you know well the facts will come out I want the facts to come in I mean while President Trump is very angry shows a lot of the right wing over robert muller because robert muller apparently wants to view encrypted messages so according to CNBC comm special counsel robert Muller's team is requesting that witnesses turn in their personal phones to inspect their encrypted messaging programs and potentially view conversations between associates linked to president donald trump these these witnesses are cooperating because Muller does in fact have the subpoena power mowers team has been asking witnesses and the Russia probe to turn over phones for agents to examine private conversations on these various encrypted apps one of the reasons for this might be the Paul Manafort supposedly used encrypted apps in order to supposedly tamper with potential witnesses maybe that's what Muller is looking for but this has got people all hot and bothered because the more Muller digs the more people on the right are getting angry about it sean hannity was very upset about it last night he was saying the witnesses listen when I use bash he's saying sarcastically obviously Sean says why use basher phones of the hammer Hillary got away with it I don't know if I advised them to follow Hillary Clinton's lead delete all your emails and then acid-wash the emails and hard drives on the on the new phones then take your phones and bash them with a hammer into little itsy-bitsy pieces use bleach bit remove the SIM cards and then take the pieces and hand it over to robert muller and say Hillary Rodham Clinton Clinton this is equal justice under the law okay so you know people are saying well Sean should now be indicted he's encouraging people to destroy evidence obviously sean is being sarcastic he's pointing out the double standard that exists between the Muller investigation and the Hillary investigation I agree with that double standard by the way I think that the the Hillary investigation was absolutely botched I think that it was purposefully botched by the FBI I think if you want to talk corruption in the FBI we should worry a lot less about Spygate until more evidence comes out we should worry a lot more about Hillary Clinton we should worry a lot more about the fact that the FBI was acting to essentially cover for Hillary Clinton when she was destroying emails knowing that they were classified right like that I don't think Sean is wrong about all of that but I do not appreciate the double standard I don't think just because Hillary was corrupt that means that other people should be corrupt also also right now the spy gate is running into some serious resistance from people who have actually seen the documents now one of the things that's been really funny about this a lot of people in the media who are most exercised about so-called spy gate are people who also have not seen the documents right they've seen them that same number of documents that I have meaning everything that's been publicly revealed but there's an open debate and isn't much of a debate actually inside Republican Congress over how much of spy gate is real president Trump think spy gate is real but we now have Devin Nunez who suggested that at best maybe it's real but he hasn't seen all the documents yet so he doesn't really know we've seen it we've seen on trey gowdy say that spy gate may not in fact be real and we've seen speaker Ryan say that spy gate may not in fact be real so all I've said about spy gate remains as soon as the evidence comes out happy to jump on board and so the evidence comes out not gonna jump on board with that said I would like to see somebody exercise like well somebody explain to Robert Mullen what the scope of this investigation is or can we at least publicly find out what the scope of the investigation is I think that would be helpful because like everybody else I'm getting kind of tired of this nonsense okay so time for some stuff I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like as I mentioned a couple of weeks ago I watched this year from stars the white queen which is really entertaining all about the War of the Roses the very end of the War of the Roses and there's a good book on everything leading up to the War of the Roses for several centuries by Dan Jones called the Plantagenet so if you're interested in British history and you really like this stuff Dan Jones his book the Plantagenet is well worth reading the warrior kings and queens who made England he also wrote a book on the War of the Roses Dan Jones very interesting very good writer so you should check that out if you're into reading history so that's that's worth seeing okay time for a couple of things that I hate okay so we begin with oceans eight to oceans eight is going to come out soon is the assumption and the and the reviews are coming in and it is amazing to see the political bias in the reviews the political bias in the reviews is astonishing because when you actually read what people are saying about it they are trying so hard not to say this is a bad movie it's exactly the same as Lady Ghostbusters instead of them just saying yeah movie kind of stunk they're trying so it's gotta be feminist cuz filled with women and right there women who are now - it's not Ocean's eleven which was men Nance ocean's 8 which is women and so that means then it has to be good even if it's bad so here are some of the reviews hey Lia Greenblatt in Entertainment Weekly writes ocean eights girls just want to have grand larceny can't concede is kind of starry high glass goof that summer movie season was made for even a feel even if it feels lightweight by the already zero gravity standards of the genre so what she's really saying at the end there is um it's kind of bad and it's kind of fluffy but you know the girls just wonder how grand larceny conceit is it's it's what movies were made for so the idea that movies really good movie make kind of suck but the idea of the movie is really really good here's the Guardians Benjamin Lee remember all these people are on the left while great care has been taken in populating the film with infinitely talented performers there's been less attention page the prose behind the scenes Ocean's eleven glided through its many sharp set pieces ocean eights and elegantly plods the smoothness of Soderbergh's concoction often smug yet mostly rather charming has been replaced with a bland in personality and the work of disinterested hired hand snappy playful camerawork and a deft David Holmes score are sorely missed as Ross fills his film with plainly shot montages of superficial luxury that failed to feel quite as sumptuous as they should since a nice way of saying this movie is deathly boring and poorly shot and then there's Manohla Dargis of the New York Times so she credits the ensemble cast with keeping the picture afloat she says that Anne Hathaway is comedy gold and she says that the end she has fizz and delectable timing but she says the movie kind of sucks I mean this is the thing like all of these reviews are basically the same they're all basically the same and all of the views but like here's variety oceans 8 is a casually winning heist movie no more no less but like countless films devoted to the exploits of cool male criminals and lingers most and not just for 8 year olds has a proudly scurrilous gallery of role models so in other words because it's it's women it's important right it's important it's more important than Ocean's eleven was Ocean's eleven wasn't very important cuz it I'd meant oceans 8 is very important because women can be robbers too women can be high-class thieves too now you may think to yourself well haven't there been movies made about female thieves in the past it wasn't there a movie called Clute about a female thief with Jane Fonda like all the way back in the 1970s in which I believe she was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar I think she won actually haven't there been films featuring like Anne Hathaway as a criminal like in Dark Knight Rises where she actually plays Catwoman haven't there been films with women who play who play robbers the answer is yes there have been lots of them Fellman Louise I mean like there have been lots of movies about this but know this VIP it's very important in just the same way the Black Panther was very important I'm not saying Black Panther I thought was a good movie I enjoyed the movie but there's this this sort of clarion call that went out from the tops of Hollywood that this is now an important movie capital I important movie and that means that if the movies good it's fantastic it's the best movie that everyone was made and if the movie is mediocre then it's good and Familia movie sucked and it was mediocre it's an affirmative action for important movies well I love this the rap the right people have been hired and everyone is where they're supposed to be that level of planning makes the heist in ocean's hate run fairly smoothly as for the film itself similarly curated with care it gets the job done without ever being one for the record books so basically this is really boring right like all of these reviews are exactly the same they're bland leave the same it is really really funny is Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times ocean's 8 has something to prove and that determination is both its strength and its limitation it works hard stays on point de lifter delivers a few nifty surprises and sometimes rises to a thrilling pitch of excitement at least before this story Peters out and it's belabored third act but the movie refuses to do is dazzle or resonate or overstay its welcome which is another way of saying it doesn't really linger as eight as eights go it could stand to be a little crazier again all of theirs they're working so hard not to say the movie sucks I've never steam credits worked so hard not to say movie sucks before usually critics revel in writing bad reviews really like if you're if you're a movie critic and it gets rid of bad review it's juicy it's a sink your teeth into how bad the movie is you get to like pull out all the stops and be as mean as you want to be get to be triumph the insult comic dog here you can have comedy gold with the biggest Hollywood actresses on planet earth I mean these like universal it's like Cate Blanchett and half away they every major actress of the modern era is in this movie the movie stinks anyway I mean if you can't make fun of that I know you can make fun of it's like making fun of the Los Angeles Lakers back in the early 2000s when they got Gary Payton Karl Malone Shaq and Kobe and they somehow lost to the Detroit Pistons right like there's there's no way to not make fun of that there just isn't okay other things that I hate so Google has decided it's important to change those emojis so this is a real thing so there's big talk about inclusion and diversity at Google so if you need any evidence of Google making this a priority may I direct your attention to the salad emoji we've removed the egg in Android P beta to making this a more inclusive vegan salad the egg was too insulting for vegans so they removed the egg in the salad emoji this is how you got Trump this is how you got Trump you idiots my goodness you know what I'm insulted by salad in general I'm insulted by people who say salad tastes good they're full of it they're liars okay anyone who says salad tastes good and then they and then they say oh yeah no I'm gonna forgo the bread I'm gonna go for a salad yeah you're a liar okay they I'm talking to you right now you if you say oh no I love salad lies okay you prefer salad because you don't wanna get fat got it that's totally fine but can we stop with the gas lighting please okay the salad what makes the salad good is the dressing or the cheese or the meat or the stuff on top of the salad nobody nobody ever has said you know what I need a real treat tonight give me some lettuce with a tomato on it no one has ever said that so I'm insulted by this emoji just because it's salad it should be immediately removed and instead they should put like V gonna be nice to the vegans put like vegan ice cream okay like make it taste somewhat decent like stack some sugar on it just like a sugar cane how about that that's that's vegan right right okay shouts okay so I guess I went off track here salads stupid I guess that's the point that I'm making here sounds gross and anyone who says differently is lying to you okay final thing that I hate today so a Maryland Democrat decided that it was necessary to cut and add insulting the president of the united states why because this Maryland Democrat happens to be pro-lgbt and here is what the ad looks like I'm rich madelene oh I'm running for governor to deliver progressive results and to stand up to Donald Trump here are a few of the things I've done that already infuriate him I protected Planned Parenthood from the Republicans in Congress I helped man assault weapons in Maryland I believe in public schools not vouchers and what's the number one way I piss off Donald Trump and the Republicans take that Trump okay um a few things about this hat so number one using children as little props take that NRA ask the guests this have enrolled what NRA stands for it no clue right and then I like deep thing Trump actually is like oh my god they kissed oh my god the gay guys kissed Oh God ah like you really think Donald Trump you think we're ly Donald Trump cares about that like deeply Donald Trump held up a rainbow flag at one of his rallies in 2016 do you think the Donald Trump would take that Trump like really if you think that part of the resistance is you effing your husband like hey I just I'm so confused by this like if this is really like do what you want to do it's a free country and like what like wow you're gay okay that changes everything somehow but no one explained why okay but what like I don't find this effect like who finds this like deeply offensive who's like ooh take that Trump I know every time like when I'm when I'm when I'm when I'm in the mood with my wife I'm not like take dad Obama but what in the world this is a stupidest thing I've ever seen and I love it they they're throwing it out there like you know okay I guess you know having sex with your with your boyfriend or your husband's you own the Khans I guess that's the thing you can do I'm just confused as to why you think Donald Trump would possibly in a million years care about this and be insulted by it like even Mike Pence would not be insulted or care about this like it's the insulting thing honestly about the sad is the insult that they think that I care about this then they're like oh my God my life is broken now because you're gay who everything has changed you've totally devastated me woo I remember there was there's a situation when I was interviewing quick story and then we'll and then we will part so when I was interviewing for a law firm job and in my Harvard Law School days so I graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School which means that you're gonna get a job in law I had the worst interview record of anyone in the history of Harvard Law School so far as I'm aware but one 4:32 in my interviews for Harvard Law School because I had the titles of my book on my resume that's really not speculation in the office of career services told me to take it off my resume as soon as I did I got two offers within a couple of weeks but in any case there was one situation in which I was interviewing at a major American law firm major law firm they had an outlet in Los Angeles and they do this thing when they bring you out to interview for your follow-up interview and that is they fix you up with somebody who they think will get along with because they're trying to sell the firm they're trying to show you that the firm's a wonderful place to work and that when you're working 2,200 billable hours reviewing pagination that it's just gonna be the best time you ever had right which is complete nonsense anyway so they decide you know what be great Ben Shapiro right it's a Jewish name and he went to Harvard Law School let's get a couple of Jews from Harvard Law School does hang him out to lunch okay well first of all chances are isn't gonna go that well because first of all I'm Orthodox second of all I'm conservative so or if you say Jews from Harvard Law School that usually means like 98% of the time radical left so the couple these Jews from Harvard Law School take me out to lunch and this is supposed to be welcoming you into the intersectional clique that will be this law firm and it already started off weird because I said I wanted to I could only eat kosher so I'm happy to go to a not kosher restaurant to have like a Coke or something and they're like no we have to go to a kosher place so like okay it's nice of you there's only one kosher place at that point in downtown Los Angeles and it is a falafel shop in the in like a hole in the wall so we're sitting there in our in our expensive suits and we're eating falafel at this hole in the wall that is not air-conditioned in middle of the summer and and and it's it's a guy and it's a girl and the guy is a radical environmentalist and the girl is a and the girl is in a girl band right she's she's also an environmentalist but she puts on her resume that she is in a girl band it's like on her profile and everything so what we're sitting there and this guy reaches into his breast pocket and he pulls out a column and he starts reading from it to me and it's about gay marriage and it's about why I think that gay marriage and straight marriage are not societally equivalent because I don't think they are and he starts reading this to me and he says do you agree with this and I said well yeah I wrote it so yeah and then and the girl then turns to me and she goes well I'm a lesbian and I said so and she was like shocked by this like she actually thought I was gonna go oh my god you're a lesbian this changed everything what what you like chicks no no oh you exist you're a real person no you know what I've changed everything I've decided I am now Pro same-sex marriage I've decided that my entire biblical worldview is false now that I've met someone who actually is homosexual it's changed my entire life okay that didn't happen obviously because that's stupid that's stupid do whatever you want it's a free country no one cares but the fact that people on the Left think that they're like owning the cons by being gay like all right all right this with this one floats your boat if that's what gets you going tonight yeah I guess that so it's a weird pick-up line but sure I mean make it make make your night better by by owning by owning Trump all right all right we'll be back here tomorrow with much much more and hopefully less stupid news I'm Ben Shapiro this is Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Senya Villarreal
