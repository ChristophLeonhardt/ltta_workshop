after decades of violence and apology for this car bomb attacks shootings and assassinations in the name of Independence Etta an acronym that stands for Basque homeland and freedom started as a student movement opposed to general Franco's military dictatorship but went on to become one of Europe's most violent and enduring armed groups from 1968 to 2010 it killed more than 820 people nearly half of them civilians their words were for them we are aware that during this long period of armed struggle we have created a lot of pain including many damages for which there is no solution we want to show respect for the dead those injured and the victims that were caused by the actions of Etta we truly apologize Spain's government welcomed the statement saying Etta had been defeated by the weapons of democracy this shows Eva's political economic social and international defeat last word is not forever but for all the Democrats we feed data with the help of the State Security Forces judges and the international community etter fell out of favor with the Basque people decades ago and for some victims the apology was not enough it doesn't fulfill my expectations I think it's a statement where they've tried to justify their acts and overall there's a selective forgiveness which I can't understand at all because we are all victims we have all suffered the pain caused by Etta the group's journey to dissolution has been long I with you in March 2006 Etta announced its first permanent ceasefire and in response the socialist government started peace talks but nine months later at a bond at car park at Madrid's International Airport killing two people then in 2010 the group announced it would not carry out further attacks a year later it declared a permanent ceasefire and 12 months ago with the help of mediators it led French authorities to a cache of weapons explosives and ammunition now completely disarmed this apology is the last step before it's full dissolution expected in May but the healing process we'll take many years Charlie Angela al-jazeera
