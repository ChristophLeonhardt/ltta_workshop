1
00:00:01,074 --> 00:00:03,610
NOW BACK TO HANNITY.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:09,249
HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.

3
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:12,151
>> IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY SERIOUS

4
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:12,485
EVENT.

5
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:13,353
WE'LL FIND OUT.

6
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:15,421
WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTS,

7
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,123
I THINK PEOPLE WILL SEE A LOT OF

8
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:18,825
BAD THINGS HAPPENED.

9
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:21,561
I HOPE IT IS NOT SO, BECAUSE IF

10
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:24,564
IT IS, THERE IS NOTHING BEEN

11
00:00:24,564 --> 00:00:25,965
ANYTHING LIKE IT IN THE HISTORY

12
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:27,200
OF OUR COUNTRY.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,302
WE ARE CLEANING EVERYTHING UP.

14
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:31,804
IT IS SO IMPORTANT, WHAT I AM

15
00:00:31,804 --> 00:00:34,007
DOING IS A SERVICE TO THIS

16
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:34,507
COUNTRY.

17
00:00:34,507 --> 00:00:36,709
WE CALL IT SPYGATE.

18
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:39,112
YOU ARE CALLING IT SPYGATE.

19
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:41,648
A LOT OF BADENINGS HAVE

20
00:00:41,648 --> 00:00:42,348
HAPPENED.

21
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:43,516
>> Jeanine: WELCOME BACK TO

22
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:46,219
A SPECIAL EDITION OF HANNITY.

23
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:48,021
THAT THE PRESIDENT GOING ON

24
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:49,922
OFFENSE THIS WEEK AGAINST THE

25
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:51,090
DEEP STATE.

26
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,525
HE DIDN'T STOP THERE.

27
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:54,694
HE SAID THE TEMDEMS ARE ALLUDING

28
00:00:54,694 --> 00:00:58,064
TO THE CONCEPT HAVING AN

29
00:00:58,064 --> 00:01:00,400
INFORMANT PLACED IN OPPOSING

30
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,670
PARTY'S CAMPAIGN IS DIFFERENT AS

31
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,005
HAVING A SPY.

32
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,341
BUT WHAT ABOUT A INFORNLANT THAT

33
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:10,643
IS PAID A FORTUNE AND WHO SETS

34
00:01:10,643 --> 00:01:14,414
UP WAY EARLIER THAN A RUSSIAN

35
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:14,747
HOAX.

36
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:16,382
CAN ANYONE IMAGINE HAVING SPIES

37
00:01:16,382 --> 00:01:19,352
PLACED IN A COMPETTING CAMPAIGN

38
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:22,188
BY THE PEOPLE IN ABSOLUTE POWER

39
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:26,125
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF

40
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,527
ADVANTAGE AND GAIN.

41
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:30,697
AND THE EXPENDITURE OF FAR MORE

42
00:01:30,697 --> 00:01:33,599
MONEY LOST.

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,038
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ARE

44
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:40,239
CAUSING PEOPLE TO LASH OUT.

45
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,742
>> WHAT IS THE INFORMANT AND

46
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:43,443
A SPY.

47
00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:47,447
>> IT IS TYPICAL OF MR. TRUMP TO

48
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:47,947
MISCHARACTERIZE.

49
00:01:47,947 --> 00:01:50,049
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MR. TRUMP

50
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:52,151
IS IT AS YOU SAID MASTERFUL AT

51
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:54,354
IN TERMS OF TWISTING THE TRUTH

52
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:56,489
TO SUPPORT HIS NARRATIVE.

53
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,091
A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPARE THAT THE

54
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:00,560
F.B.I. AND CIA DIDN'T DO ENOUGH

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,462
TO UNCOVER WHAT RUSSIA WAS

56
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:03,062
DOING.

57
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:05,398
THIS IS WHAT THE F.B.I. WAS

58
00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:06,899
SUPPOSED TO DO AND THANK

59
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,601
GOODNESS THEY DID IT.

60
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:10,870
>> Jeanine: JOINING US WITH

61
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,506
REACTION, THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK

62
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:15,808
"THE RUSSIA HOAX".

63
00:02:15,808 --> 00:02:19,212
GREG HAND AND FENTON AND FOX

64
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:24,584
NEWS KRNTOR CHARLIE HURTZ.

65
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:27,720
DID THE F.B.I. HAVE A BASIS FOR

66
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,990
A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OR

67
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,258
SUFFICIENT INTELLIGENCE BASIS TO

68
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:33,326
LAUNCH A PROBE.

69
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:36,696
>> THEY HAD NEITHER AND THE

70
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:39,599
EVIDENCE IS CLEAR AND YET THEY

71
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,567
LAUNCHED THE INVESTIGATION IN

72
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:43,636
THEN CANDIDATE TRUMP AND

73
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:45,004
CONTINUED IT WITH PRESIDENT

74
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:45,338
TRUMP.

75
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:47,573
AND SO THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHTLY

76
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:49,909
OUTRAGED AND I AM HAPPY HE

77
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:51,944
EXPRESSED IT THAT THEY USED

78
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:54,514
A SPY TO INFILTRATE HIS CAMPAIGN

79
00:02:54,514 --> 00:03:00,486
AND TO ELICIT AND TO ENDUCE AND

80
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:02,321
ENTRAP PEOPLE.

81
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,490
IF IT WAS DONE FOR POLITICAL

82
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,826
REASON AND IT WAS AMAZING IT

83
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:07,260
WAS.

84
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,529
THAT IS A CRIME AND CALM WOULD

85
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:11,631
ABUSE OF POWER.

86
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:15,635
THEY WERE DEPRIVING CANDIDATE

87
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:18,037
RIGHTS AND HIS RIGHT TO PRIVACY

88
00:03:18,037 --> 00:03:20,740
AND FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

89
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,608
>> Jeanine: TOM, THERE IS A LOT

90
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:24,243
OF THE TALK ABOUT AN INFORMANT

91
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:25,645
AND A SPY.

92
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:27,246
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

93
00:03:27,246 --> 00:03:30,082
AN INFORMANT AND A SPY?

94
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:34,120
>> THERE IS NO PRACTICAL

95
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,554
DIFFERENCE.

96
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:36,122
ON THE PART OF THE OBAMA

97
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:37,523
ADMINISTRATION, THE TOP

98
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:40,993
LEADERSHIP WAS FORCED TO ADMIT

99
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:42,728
THEY HAD SOMEONE ON THE PAYROLL

100
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:43,863
OF ONE AGENCY.

101
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:46,666
MAYBE MORE THAN ONE AGENCY.

102
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,167
AND WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN

103
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:50,937
WITHOUT PRECEDENT IN AT LEAST

104
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:52,004
MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY.

105
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:56,375
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE

106
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,178
'60s TO FIND ANYTHING SIMILAR IN

107
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:01,848
GOVERNMENT ABUSE WHEN YOU HEAR

108
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:06,886
CLAPPER AND BRENAR AND KEEPY

109
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:08,921
CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT FOR

110
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:09,355
CRITICIZED.

111
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:11,424
THEY ARE A LIST OF PEOPLE WHO

112
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:14,126
HAVE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL

113
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:16,295
LIABILITY OF WHAT WENT ON IN THE

114
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:17,529
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

115
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,966
AND BRENNAN GO CRAZY AND ATTACK

116
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:22,702
TRUMP LIKE HE IS, YOU HAVE TO

117
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:26,873
WONDER WHY ON EARTH WAS HE EVER

118
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:30,042
ALLOWED NEAR COUNTER RELATED

119
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:32,245
INTELLIGENCE AND HE OBVIOUSLY

120
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:34,146
HATED AND IT EXPLAINS WHY THEY

121
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:36,449
WENT OFF THE RAILS UNDER THE BUM

122
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:37,783
BULL ADMINISTRATION.

123
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:39,986
>> Jeanine: WHEN TOM SAID THEY

124
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:42,054
OBVIOUSLY HATED MR. TRUMP.

125
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:46,826
IT IS NOT ANY MORE CLEARER.

126
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:49,829
A INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND

127
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:52,298
THEY HATED PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

128
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:57,403
WHEN DEVIN NUNEZ APPEARED TO SEE

129
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:59,839
THE PRESIDENT HAD A TINFOIL HATE

130
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,075
AND DEVIN NUNEZ OFF HIS ROCKER

131
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:05,111
BUT IT IS COMING TO FROM

132
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:05,578
YOURICIAN.

133
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:07,947
>> EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS

134
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:12,285
BEHAVING BECZARLY AND MEETING

135
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:14,220
WITH IN SECURE LOCATIONS AND ALL

136
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,988
OF THE PRELSZ MADE FUN OF HIM.

137
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:17,623
AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING TODAY,

138
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:20,026
ALL OF THE CONCERNS THAT HE

139
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:22,228
HINTED AT A YEAR AGO, OVER

140
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:25,398
A YEAR AGO CAME TO FRUITION.

141
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:27,466
AND AS TOM POINTED OUT.

142
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:29,936
EVEN THE DEMOCRATS HAVING TO

143
00:05:29,936 --> 00:05:32,071
ACKNOWLEDGE YES, THEY DID INSERT

144
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:33,639
A SPY INTO THE POLITICAL

145
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,040
CAMPAIGN.

146
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,209
AND I THINK IT IS UNPRECEDENTED.

147
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:40,146
YOU KNOW, WE HEARD OF HENCE OF

148
00:05:40,146 --> 00:05:42,582
THIS KIND OF THINGS IN THE '60

149
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:43,583
AND '70s.

150
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,485
IT WAS NOT, I WOULD ARGUE IT IS

151
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:49,922
NOT AS BAD AND EXTENSIVE AS.

152
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:51,524
THIS THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING,

153
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:54,460
THEY WERE ACTUALLY ACTIVELY

154
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,028
PUNISHING PEOPLE, POLITICAL

155
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:57,563
OPPONENTS WHICH IS SHOCKING.

156
00:05:57,563 --> 00:05:58,831
>> Jeanine: IT IS SHOCKING.

157
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:01,767
AND THE AMAZING PART OF IT,

158
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,135
GREG, YOU HAVE THE REPUBLICANS

159
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:05,905
THAT ARE LOOKING AT SOME PEOPLE

160
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:09,675
WHOSE NAMES WE HAVE ONLY HEARD

161
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:10,042
OF.

162
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:13,512
BILL PRES STAFF.

163
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:16,248
HE WAS CHANGING THE NAME FROM

164
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:18,184
GROSS NEGLIGENCE TO EXTREMELY

165
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:18,551
CAREFUL.

166
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:22,188
AND MICHAEL STIENBAC K.

167
00:06:22,188 --> 00:06:24,223
AND JOHN COLOG WHATEVER HIS NAME

168
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:24,523
IS.

169
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:26,392
THESE ARE PEOPLE CALLED BEFORE

170
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:26,792
CONGRESS.

171
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:28,661
DO YOU THINK THEY WILL TAKE THE

172
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:31,163
FIFTH OR TELL US WHAT HAPPENED?

173
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:34,934
>> SO FAR THEY HAVE BEEN

174
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:35,368
OBSTRUCTING.

175
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:37,803
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TRIED

176
00:06:37,803 --> 00:06:40,306
FOR A YEAR TO QUESTION HIGH

177
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:42,141
RANKING OFFICIALS OF THE F.B.I.

178
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:44,710
AND THE F.B.I. IS REFUSING.

179
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,946
THAT IS OBSTRUCTION MUCH

180
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:49,548
CONGRESS AND A CLASSIC TROUGH

181
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:52,151
FOR PEOPLE TO CLAIM THAT THE

182
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:53,285
F.B.I. CANNOT TALK ABOUT

183
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:55,221
A PENDING INVESTIGATION.

184
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:57,823
THAT IS TRUE EXCEPT FOR CONGRESS

185
00:06:57,823 --> 00:06:59,959
WHICH HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY

186
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,728
AND A RIGHT UNDER A LAWFUL

187
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:04,296
SUBPEONA TO OBTAIN THIS

188
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:05,564
INFORMATION AND TELL.

189
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:07,366
IT IS OBSTRUCTION MUCH CONGRESS

190
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:08,768
TO FAIL TO COMPLY.

191
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:11,971
AND THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT TO

192
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:14,073
DEMAND AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE

193
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:15,408
EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

194
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:16,976
>> OF THAT BRANCH.

195
00:07:16,976 --> 00:07:20,112
>> THE DOY AND F.B.I. COMPLY

196
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:21,647
WITH THE LAW.

197
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:22,948
>> Jeanine: I HAVE GIVEN YOU

198
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:25,217
CREDIT IN THE PAST THAT YOU HAVE

199
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:27,953
DONE THINGS THAT CONGRESS HASN'T

200
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:28,287
DONE.

201
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:30,256
IT IS YOUR DETERMINATION OF

202
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:32,558
TRYING TO GET RECORDS THAT GOT

203
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:33,693
THINGS THAT CONGRESS HASN'T BEEN

204
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:35,261
ABLE TO GET.

205
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:38,798
SO RIGHT NOW, WE'VE GOT THE

206
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:41,434
F.B.I. AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

207
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:43,369
WHO STONE WALLING, SLOW WALKING

208
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:45,504
AND SAYING THEY DON'T HAVE

209
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:47,406
RECORDS WHEN THEY DO HAVE

210
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:49,208
RECORDS AND THEY HAVE BEEN

211
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:49,909
LYING.

212
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,510
WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT DO AT

213
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,111
THIS POINT?

214
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:54,513
HE IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND

215
00:07:54,513 --> 00:07:55,781
F.B.I. AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

216
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:57,083
ARE UNDER HIM.

217
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,052
AND WHAT SHOULD HE DO TO GET IT

218
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:00,453
OUT.

219
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:03,489
NORDER A MANDATORY

220
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:07,126
DECLASSIFICATION REVIEW OF THE

221
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:09,261
DOCUMENTS WITHIN A DECENT AMOUNT

222
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:10,896
OF TIME AND HAVE OUTSIDE EXPERTS

223
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:18,704
THAT HE TRUSTS REVIEW THESE

224
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:21,440
RECORDS AND MAKE SURE NOTHING IS

225
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,008
HELD INPROPERLY.

226
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:24,977
WE ARE WAITING ON THE TEXT

227
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:25,411
MESSAGE.

228
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:27,179
THERE IS A PROCESS IN COURT FOR

229
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:29,315
THE TEXT MESSAGES.

230
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:31,383
HE CAN ORDER THE JUSTICE

231
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:33,619
DEPARTMENT AND F.B.I. TO COMPLY

232
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:39,707
WITH THE TRANSPARAMILITARY

233
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:40,291
WITH THE TRANSPARAMILITAR

234
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:40,326
WITH THE TRANSPARENILITAR

235
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:40,359
WITH THE TRANSPARENCYITAR

236
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:40,392
WITH THE TRANSPARENCY TAR

237
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:40,426
WITH THE TRANSPARENCY LAR

238
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:40,693
WITH THE TRANSPARENCY LAW.

239
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:43,095
THEY ARE PROTECTING THE MUELLER

240
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:44,530
OPERATION WHICH HAS ITS LODGES

241
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,867
IN ALL OF THE SPYING AND FISA

242
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:48,701
WARRANT AND NATIONAL SECURITY

243
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:51,971
LETTER AND TAKING UP THE PHONE

244
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:53,873
RECORDS AND UNMASKING AND USE OF

245
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:54,807
CLINTON DOSSIER.

246
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:56,809
THAT IS PART OF MUELLER'S

247
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:59,245
OPERATION AND WHY THEY ARE

248
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:00,246
RESISTING CONGRESS.

249
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:06,552
AND THEY KNOW IF IT IS UNCOVERED

250
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:08,187
MUELLER'S OPERATION ENDS.

251
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:10,222
>> Jeanine: I AM NOT CRITICAL OF

252
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:11,924
THOSE IN CONGRESS WHO ARE DOING

253
00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:12,858
WHAT THEY CAN.

254
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:15,494
BUT IT IS IT TIME TO GET IT

255
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:15,961
RECOMMENDING.

256
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:18,330
IT IS TIME FOR CONSEQUENCE AND

257
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,698
ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT'S WHY

258
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:20,566
DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT.

259
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:23,569
I WILL GO TO YOU, CHARLIE, WHAT

260
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:25,371
DO YOU SAY TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO

261
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:27,039
SAY THESE ARE MORE HEARINGS TO

262
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,543
MAKE THE DEMOCRATS TO LOOK BAD

263
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:34,246
AND GET THEM TO TESTIFY AND IT

264
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:35,848
IS PROTECTIVE NATIONAL SECURITY

265
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:36,182
ISSUE.

266
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:37,783
>> THEY ARE ALL STALLING AND

267
00:09:37,783 --> 00:09:39,985
LOOK AT THE THINGS, I WOULD CALL

268
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:42,555
THEM CRIMES COMMITTED IN THE

269
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,623
CAMPAIGN, AND AFTER THE

270
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:46,559
CAMPAIGN, WHY DID THEY DO IT?

271
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,228
THE REASON THEY DID IT WITH

272
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:50,529
ABANDON, BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT

273
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:51,397
HILLARY CLINTON WOULD WIN THE

274
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:53,732
ELECTION AND NONE OF IT WOULD

275
00:09:53,732 --> 00:09:55,634
COME TO LIGHT AND IT WOULD NOT

276
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:56,035
MATTER.

277
00:09:56,035 --> 00:09:57,436
>> Jeanine: WE KNOW THAT.

278
00:09:57,436 --> 00:09:58,938
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

279
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:01,006
>> THEY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO

280
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:03,843
WIN CONTROL IN NOVEMBER AND THEN

281
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:05,411
THEY WILL COVER IT UP.

282
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:09,114
I THINK TOM FENTON IS RIGHT.

283
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:11,083
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BEGIN

284
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,019
DECLASSIFICATION AND BLOW IT OUT

285
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:17,723
IN TO HAVE A HOW DOWN.

286
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:20,359
THESE PEOPLE DO WORK FOR THE

287
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,261
EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

288
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:25,331
THEY ARE ANSWERABLE TO THE

289
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:26,665
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.

290
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:27,967
>> Jeanine: GREG FINAL QUESTION

291
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,969
TO YOU.

292
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:32,071
SIGNIFICANCE OF STRZOK NOT

293
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:33,706
TESTIFYING, IS HE COOPERATING?

294
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:38,177
>> NO, IF I WERE HIM I WILL

295
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:38,577
COOPERATE.

296
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:40,446
IT IS IMPORTANT TO TELL THE

297
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:41,213
TRUTH.

298
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:42,915
HE'S IN SERIOUS LEGAL JEOPARDY.

299
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:44,950
BUT THIS IS A CLASSEC COVER UP

300
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,787
THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN

301
00:10:48,787 --> 00:10:49,221
WASHINGTON.

302
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:53,559
THEY CLAIM THE MANTEL OF

303
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:53,993
CLASSIFIED.

304
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:56,128
AND WE FIND OUT LATER THAT WAS

305
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:57,129
A LIE.

306
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:59,498
>> Jeanine: GREG, YOU KNOW WE

307
00:10:59,498 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE AN ABSENT ATTORNEY GENERAL
