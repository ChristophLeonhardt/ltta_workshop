Hi Guys, I'ts vlogmas Day 23
One of the most exciting parts of the holiday
season, for me, was snow.
In Wisconsin, we used to get buckets of it,
and nothing made me happier.
Snow angel-ing, building forts and snowmen,
going sledding are some of the absolute biggest
joys of my entire  childhood.
I actually used to love snow so much that
I would pray, to Jesus, and also  Santa,
for more snow starting around October every
year.
When Harry Potter books started coming out
and we all wanted to be little witches and
wizards I used to try and figure out like spells to bring the white stuff.
Like, I remember mixing up glitter and ice
cubes in a cup and dumping it all over my backyard
thinking that the sky would open up and start
flurrying 
Why are kids so weird?
And the few years we didn’t get any snow
left me so devastated. My brother and I would
cut out paper snowflakes and tape them to
the windows of our house
And then on Christmas morning we'd get our parents up before
sunrise to open presents so we couldn’t
look outside to see that there was only dead,
brown grass.
And this year, it’s not looking like we’ll
have any Christmas snow, so it looks like
we’ll be doing the same thing.
♪I'm dreaming of a white christmas♪
♪Just like the one's I used to know♪
♪Where the treetops glisten, and children listen♪
♪and children listen to hear sleighbells in the snow♪
So tell me in comments—does it
snow where you live this time of year? Is
snow something you enjoy or loathe, is it
even Christmas without it?
Cause I'd say maybe not
