WELL, MY EXPERIENCE IN THE GREEN PARTY AND SOCIALIST PARTY I FELT VERY MARGINALIZED THERE BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE ISRAEL. WHAT THIS IS THE WORST PLACE ON EARTH. HAVE YOU BEEN THERE? Sean: I AM THE BIGGEST IT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE WITH PROBLEMS LIKE EVERY PLACE ELSE. I DO A LOT OF DRINKING MEAN THINKING AND I HAVE THE SOLUTION FOR IT. I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THIS FOR LIKE 20 YEARS. JEWISH GRANDMOTHERS AND EVERYONE WHO LIVES OVER THERE, IF WE COULD WRITE UP A GRANDMA'S TREATY AND PRESENT IT TO THE POWER THAT WOULD BE THE FIFTY FASTEST WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.
