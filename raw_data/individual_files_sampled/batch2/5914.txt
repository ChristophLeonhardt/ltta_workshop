all right welcome back everyone joining us now from Washington with a look at Axios a.m. national political reporter for Axios Jonathan Swan Jonathan good morning to my friend let's talk about axis is one big thing this morning what is it sources close to president Trump say he believes that his new national security adviser John Bolton will finally deliver him the foreign policy he wants particularly on Iran in North Korea he John Kelly the chief of staff I'm told had absolutely nothing to do with this decision John Bolton was not his choice nor was he James Madison's choice this was pure 100% Donald J Trump how dramatic of a change was it for Trump to replace McMaster with somebody like John Bolton who even Rex Tillerson did not want to have anywhere around his orbit of foreign policy decision making a couple of months ago it's hard it's hard to overstate how significant this is it's incredibly significant not only because John Bolton is far more hawkish all around in North Korea than HR McMaster though of course he is those things but but also because he knows how to manage a bureaucracy he's experienced and he wrote a book No Surrender in which he proudly recalls his 2001 confirmation hearing Joe Biden and in that hearing said to him my problem with you is not that you're incompetent it's that you're too competent I would rather you be incompetent you know and stupid because the way that the reason Tubbs and moderates are so afraid of John Bolton is not only he has these ideas but he actually knows how to execute on them and and that's why he scares so many people you know across the center and to the left of American politics so Jonathan under that you alluded to the president finally having somebody who can execute his foreign policy or at least his national security policy policy what is Axios learning about how Trump made his decision how did he get to this conclusion with what has happened over the past year with the previous national security advisors a previous Secretary of State that he did not particularly get along while with a senior administration official I spoke to late last night put it this way they said it was a snap decision after six months of public rumination described this because the staff knew he was unhappy with HR McMaster HR McMaster knew he was unhappy with HR McMaster the staff knew he was considering making a change but I will tell you I'm reliably told that John Bolton woke yesterday morning with no idea in the world that by the end of the day he was going to be named an appointed national security adviser and doing a hit on Fox that evening as the new national security adviser he knew he was in the mix he knew his name was being mentioned but you know this was Donald Trump in the room making the decision and as usual his staff had to scramble to make it all happen and I wonder if he would have been outed as the new national security adviser had he not been spotted walking into the West Wing around 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon I think there was some White House reporters who spotted him walking in with a bit of a smile on his face and that kind of tip people's hats a little bit let me ask you really quickly if I can how do you think this will change u.s. foreign policy on some of the issues that you've talked about North Korea on Iran perhaps even on trade with China well I would output two I would flag two things one is in May is when the next deadline comes up for whether Trump decides to wave sanctions on Iran I think any intelligent observer would have to say that the chances of him just terror affectively terminating the Iran deal putting heavy sanctions back on Tehran have just raised and gone up dramatically overnight John Bolton believes this is a terrible deal he he believes exactly what Donald Trump does he wants to tear up the deal HR McMaster had been working with James Madison Rex Tillerson to persuade the president that tearing up the deal was not a good idea the second thing I would flag is this summit the supposed summit that's happening with Kim jong-un yeah look already uncertain whether it will actually happen Trump's obviously public he committed to it I think it's even more uncertain now John Bolton has an uncompromising attitude towards North Korea he believes the only language they understand is the angled language of credible military threats so I think the diplomatic track is far more uncertain now with North Korea yeah absolutely and if there's one area there may be some differences between the President and John Bolton it may be the issue of Russia so we'll see how that one also plays out Jonathan Swan great to have you this morning live from Washington DC we're going to be reading access am in just a little bit and
