thousands of documents relating to controversial episodes in British history appear to have gone missing the UK's National Archives claimed they were misplaced or removed by civil servants which doesn't sound too careful let's see what Sir Polly Boyd has got on this in London hi Polly yeah what kind of documents are we talking about here surely these are something that should be looked after carefully but they've disappeared a lot of questions let's answer some look the National Archive is a very important resource here especially for people like historians and for journalists it looks after the most important papers relating to the history of the country and the idea is a perfectly transparent system so once these government files are Declassified anyone over the age of 16 should be able to go there and to access them but not all of them it turns out some of the files relating to Thor near chapters of British history shall we say appear to be missing now among the missing files there are papers relating to the Falklands War there are documents relating to the Northern Ireland Ireland troubles and perhaps most controversially files relating to a very famous case called the zinovy of letter that was way back in 1924 they appear to be missing now this was a huge political scandal at the time because mi6 almost certainly forged a letter that was leaked to the press that discredited the Labour government at the time and resulted in its ultimate downfall now all the missing files are listed as misplaced while on loan to a government department so we've got a situation where there are a number of different government departments under pressure to explain why they have taken these bits of paper but they have failed to give them back now we've asked for a comment from the Home Office over that as an avi of letter we've had no response as yet from them we have however heard from the Foreign Office now the Foreign Office had misplaced a file relating to a is called the Markov case that was back in 1978 it was a shooting of a Bulgarian dissident journalists over on Waterloo Bridge not too far from where I'm sitting now this is what the Foreign Office had to say about that missing file take a listen 17 out of 19 documents have been recovered and we're sending them back to the National Archives we're still searching for the three documents that have not yet been accounted for so an explanation there and clearly efforts being made to shall we say correct what has happened because the public here has a right to access these documents these chapters of British history rather than finding that they have been misplaced and according to some perhaps a little too conveniently now the opposition Labour Party here has called for an investigation into the missing documents otherwise they say there'll be allegations of a cover-up in relation to this while human rights groups like Amnesty International like reprieve they use these archives quite often to search for evidence of human rights violations they're now demanding that the Prime Minister to resume that she launched a search for these missing documents across all the government departments that have failed to return them to the National Archive all right Polly things transpired that Arty's Polly Baker and learned a mistake he learned in - to get some more thoughts on it we're joined live by international affairs commentator Jonathan Steele hey Jonathan you've been listening in I know you've been there across this it's just an unfortunate coincidence that some of these and highly controversial papers belonging to highly controversial cases have just gone missing was it careless was it more to it than that do you think I think there's more to it than that I mean if you lose one or two documents that could be just a mistake human error by somebody innocently making a mistake but if large numbers more than a thousand documents have got lost and they most of them seem to refer to very controversial cases then you have to begin to smell a rat do you think these papers will now come to light and there's a call for it we've put in a request the Prime Minister's are gonna be asked do you think they will all come to light or have they been lost for good some of these well it's impossible to say you can't answer that question 100% we'll just have to see over the next few days and weeks whether they do come to light again but it is an absolute scandal because as you pointed out most of them refer to incidents in the past where Britain was in a very bad position there was a question of torture in Northern Ireland there was an obvious letter I mean interestingly when it's a time when we're talking about fake news being used to tamper with elections all kinds of allegations being made here's the case where British intelligence definitely did tamper with an election in 1924 and there's no doubt about it but we haven't got the the evidence that was once available has now gone missing yeah I think you'd think if the UK's National Archives have documents you think maybe they're almost especially if they're important documents you think they would maybe keep duplicates or is that wishful thinking I don't know how it works well that's another of the questions that's being asked did did you keep documents did you make copies did you make duplications where are the duplications why didn't you then send the originals back if you were making a copy why didn't the government department send it back to the National Archives where they belong if they borrowed them just on a temporary basis so their whole series of questions so we should need to be answered where should the hedgerow lay do you think UK National Archives or the department's to where they've gone and be lost I think it's the government Department some in the National Archives perhaps should never have lent them out without better safeguards that they'd be returned within a short space of time but the government has the ultimate power and they can order the National Archives to lend material to them so they're the ones who should take the blame for this not the National Archives I wonder little bit it'll bring in the caller suppose as well in the future for all this stuff to be digitized as well as being physically there in paper to put on some sort of digital record I guess in future well it's always easy to white computers to and so now I'm just putting them on a digital thing that doesn't safeguard them forever if this ill will people will find a way to destroy things unfortunately real mystery in it Jonathan Steele international affairs commentator thanks to across the story we'll continue their follow it up and takes your input too
