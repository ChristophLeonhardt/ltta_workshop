00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,911
Enock GLidden is a paraplegic
rock climber.

2
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,680
He relies on his arms to climb

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,549
with the help of adaptive
equipment.

4
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,519
Last year, he finished an
1,800-foot route

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,723
in Yosemite Valley.
It took nearly 4,000 pull-ups.

6
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:29,162
This is one of many climbing
trips organized

7
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:33,466
by Paradox Sports for people
with disabilities.

8
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,969
The climbers on this trip are
already experienced

9
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,638
and will focus on 
particular skills.

10
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:49,349
Adam Payne was diagnosed 
with Ataxia, a rare disease 

11
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:54,154
that affects muscle 
coordination, in 1997.

12
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,622
He is a national gold medalist

13
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,391
in competitive adaptive
climbing.

14
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:08,601
Shawn Sturges became blind 
just after he turned 18.

15
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,337
He's been climbing for less
than two years,

16
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,040
and was on the U.S. 
national team in the

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,577
Paraclimbing World Championship
in 2016.

18
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:23,416
After losing my sight,
I've learned to

19
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,719
kind of go into the unknown
and not worry about what's

20
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,290
ahead of me but enjoy the
moment.

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:00:00,000
I love climbing because it
shows me that life isn't over.
