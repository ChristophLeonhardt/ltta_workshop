wondered any of you would like to come

and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> live in the Midlands area</font>

46
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,310
and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> bored like me and want to</font>

47
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,899
kind of see what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it's called</font>

48
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,000
down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rabbit hole I know I took a</font>

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,890
while think your name and I reserve I

50
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,689
but the reasons go down the rabbit hole

51
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,640
is because you know everything looks

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,719
really normal on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the surface it might</font>

53
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,040
look like really glum and just like your

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,930
average British shitty but I kind of

55
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,909

56
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,640

58
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,060
really interesting kind of deep

59
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,819
philosophical cool creative things going

60
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,800
on hopefully and that's why i believe

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,330
