don't want to see you the riots and the
 man but you got to do some
alright looks like someone's being

issue is but this is level three
oh there you go you think it do you
think this is safe yeah if you got you
guys know how come you not using them no
peaceful protest
all right so we don't know exactly
what's happening but a few squad cars
just zoomed past us and we heard a pop
way way down there and there was a large
group just passing us so but the police
have made the announcement they're
telling everyone to disperse and we've
got the LRAD going off so look at the
journalists all the masks up the police
are forming a line st. Louis County
police are moving in in a SWAT vehicle
they've got a rifle on top of
so a journalist is telling me that a
large group of people came up to
Ferguson Avenue in such blowing bottles
now looks like a lot of the protest
group they're making their way back up
to the other side but they still few
lingering
those of you standing in the middle of
the street on North wind's at West
Florissant you are lawfully assembled
and you will be subject to arrest please
get out of the streets
those of you that are not moving you
need to continue to move north towards
chambers please stay on the sidewalk and
continue to move are you will be subject
to arrest you need to exit the roadway
get out of the roadway remove the
objects from the roadway you are
unlawfully assembled what sounded like
gunshots a bottle was just thrown
tear gas fired
both directions teargas being fired now
by the police so flash grenades
the tear gas or the smoke but what
sounded like gunshots is those more
gunshots more another bottle thrown
we've got gas being fired in almost
every direction
someone telling me that what's being
thrown is smoke but some of it looks
definitely looks like smoke
something was just thrown all right
we've got some oak going up on us I just
got hit
yeah I'm cold I don't know I think I hit
my little bullet
it's got hit the leg
so there's the all right again
it looks different and I'm not getting
burned but I just took something sitting
in the light 11:04 p.m. police have just
started engaging the protesters here
with what we believe are smoke smoke
bombs
there were several gunshots fired before
the police there's a ricochet
looks like a smoke bomb just ricocheted
please please
police shout the helicopter has lights
on us
sois police another truck pulling in
though so there's a fire set in the
middle of the road straight ahead
what's up
whether you
cows - yes - I don't know out there
there's a fire in the street but I don't
think there's a stew yet we would know
yeah oh yeah
now I can smell it
yes
excuse me
all right we'll get hit by tear gas
yeah dude yeah it's morning even hitting
every much work
all right that's tear gas
shooting that's real we've got live
fire large successes of live fire right
which way
you
Hey
all right so I'm good where we're holed
up here in in a front front yard just
around the corner from where where it
got hot just across the street started
with protesters occupying the street
putting up Street cones refusing the
order of the of the police we're online
so yeah which thrown the corner run Lang
we're about a block not even a block
from from where I went down but the
first thing that happened
after the police oh I should say the
police there's a model started getting
thrown and I'm not sure what happened
first the the live fire I think I think
the live gunfire from somewhere across
the street is what happened first but
then the police start firing smoke at
first I don't believe it was two gas
because I didn't you know we were
surrounded by it it was fine but it's
they they definitely switched out -
gasps I got I got two gas harder than
I've ever been I was surrounded many of
the journalists were pinned down behind
this transformer in the road as several
whizzes went from straight overhead
those were those were real bullets
coming I believe coming from somewhere
across the street I don't believe it was
from the police we uh we were surrounded
by a cloud of teargas when the police
came up to us and yell just get out get
out get out and all the press ran for it
so you know I hopped the fence to turn
on this block I'm ducked out behind a
car right now if you're the journalists
and locals are helping us out but we
gotta we gotta be real careful man those
uh uh it was the most the most live fire
yet someone told me that they're not
messing out the handguns anymore guys
you can move down here me please we do
staging areas down there we can't lock
this area down right now they're shots
so the SWAT sing us their shots still
being fired shots were fired officer
these are live live bullets yeah yeah
hey I got a shot a shot yes we didn't
get that
keep out all right
come on
are you not getting through nothing that
potential this doesn't mean we need
to see I lost it when they were seeing
bullet that's not my problem
I'm with I'm with Vice I'm with these
guys we're all together our cars here
with you all together yes and also life
right now
look I don't care that we're live I just
want to see if you don't you miss
anybody can have all right we're going
through thank you
I just ripped this off my chest this is
no good it's been a very very intense
night there's been a lot of live bullets
being fired on what I mean by this these
are the ones meant to kill you these are
not riot weapons they were not coming
from as far as I know they were not
coming from police I believe they were
coming from the group of people who were
across the street by the Kwik Trip and
it's just along with several journalists
several other journalists we were pinned
down with you know live fire going
around us the police fired a lot of
teargas rushed us and said move move now
and we broke things have definitely
seemed to have calmed down last we saw
with the SWAT police north on West
Florissant was that they were doing what
someone referred to as a tactical sweep
they were walking guns drawn flashlights
on checking out yards and houses down
these roads but we got we got pushed
into the media zone so I'm not entirely
sure you know what's going on what's
going on on that end now but we just
connected with the rest of our crew
everyone is safe everyone's okay was uh
was a tense situation but we're going to
figure out what's going on if you guys
want to find out more about what's
happening we've got several articles up
on bison is calm about the situation in
Ferguson Missouri this is a site of the
Michael Brown protests
