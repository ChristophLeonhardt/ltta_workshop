whether or not to make recreational pot

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,740
legal and polls suggest that all five

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,429
states could vote yes nationwide weed

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,289

49
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,200
let's talk some weed so in terms of the

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> landscape and the number of</font>

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,700
initiatives so we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> record number</font>

52
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,899
what does the landscape look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

53
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">for weed enthusiasm people who want to</font>

54
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,530
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about medicinal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> awara</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanna as well</font>

55
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,390
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge year so far there are</font>

56
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,640
five states voting on ballot initiatives

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,370
to legalize marijuana sales to adults 21

58
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,500
and over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest of those is</font>

59
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,870
California which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a huge economy and</font>

60
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,980
for the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time there's East Coast</font>

61
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,170
states<font color="#E5E5E5"> Massachusetts and Maine are both</font>

62
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,150
voting on those types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of initiatives for</font>

63
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,490
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> states are voting either to enact</font>

64
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,230
new medical marijuana laws or expand

65
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,540
them so all together we've got something

66
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">like 82 million Americans living in</font>

67
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,830
states<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are voting on marijuana was</font>

68
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,870
awesome yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a significant</font>

69
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,640
portion so what drives the state to kind

70
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,130
of put an initiative like the one that's

71
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,170
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the on the ballot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for example in in</font>

72
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Florida on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the ballot like what</font>

73
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,430
prompts<font color="#CCCCCC"> our state what problems of</font>

74
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,470
people to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so Florida is voting</font>

75
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,940
one of the states<font color="#E5E5E5"> is voting on medical</font>

76
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,820
marijuana they've voted on medical

77
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,370
marijuana in the past and<font color="#E5E5E5"> voted it down</font>

78
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,540
this proposals a little bit different

79
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,800
and there's a I mean there's a

80
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,209
grassroots movement<font color="#CCCCCC"> where people are</font>

81
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,600
seeing other states they're seeing your

82
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,010
research they're seeing anecdotal

83
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,900
evidence of how helpful this can be two

84
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,090
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> with debilitating conditions to</font>

85
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,420
kids in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some cases so there's a it's I</font>

86
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,760
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a vote it's perfect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

87
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,110
ballot initiatives because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's leading</font>

88
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,550
it to the voters to decide whether this

89
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,739
is something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants to be done and</font>

90
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,660
in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of recreational marijuana so</font>

91
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,700
obviously you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Colorado Washington</font>

92
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,280
State we've seen a kind of ground swell

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,290
on a shift in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last few years of</font>

94
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,910
those states actually legalizing

95
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,190
recreational marijuana has that then had

96
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,580
the Domino effects that some people

97
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,380
hoped maybe that it would have I think

98
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,570
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find out this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> election</font>

99
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,769
whether or not it has a domino effect I

100
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:47,390
mean Colorado and Washington were the

101
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,730
first two states that started it Oregon

102
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,709
and Alaska followed suit and Washington

103
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,290
DC and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font>

104
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,330
watching those states and the sky hasn't

105
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,430
fallen a lot of the dire predictions

106
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,859
about the negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> side effects haven't</font>

107
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:02,780
come true they've seen a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tax</font>

108
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,060
revenue a lot of the promised benefits

109
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,560
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> voters are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,180
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what happened in those states</font>

111
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,340
when they decide today whether or not to

112
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,659
vote for marijuana so let's talk about

113
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:14,180
Colorado for a second because Pueblo in

114
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,548
Colorado is kind of an anomaly so tell

115
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,418
us why so Pueblo is an eastern Colorado

116
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:22,850
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had anecdotally a lot of</font>

117
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,440
problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the black market</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

118
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,500
right there close to Nebraska and Kansas

119
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,030
and they've been getting people who are

120
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,729
driving<font color="#CCCCCC"> in from out of state potentially</font>

121
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,289
trying to buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> weed and taking across</font>

122
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,880
state lines which is still illegal

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,250
federally right the local law

124
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,360
enforcement has been opposed to

125
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,370
legalization and now there's and some

126
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,590
community groups as well so now there's

127
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,729
a decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> as to whether or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're</font>

128
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,460
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to withdraw from legalization</font>

129
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,419
interesting when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have a</font>

130
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,800
guest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going to be coming to</font>

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,449
you right now Sean<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hanukkah who's the</font>

132
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:53,240
CEO of Yeti farms and he actually is a

133
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,400
business owner in Pueblo Colorado hey

134
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,130
Sean how's it going you're a great thank

135
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you know you've</font>

136
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,039
just been hearing what Keegan's been

137
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,720
saying give us the landscape because

138
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,460
everybody knows like Colorado you know

139
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,190
historically 2012 past this legalization

140
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,659
bill it's been in effect for the last

141
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:11,630
two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yet in Pueblo people want</font>

142
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,630
to change that what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on well</font>

143
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,130
what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened down there is we</font>

144
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,479
have both medical<font color="#E5E5E5"> and recreational</font>

145
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,300
marijuana markets down there and they're

146
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">both varieties doing great whoever</font>

147
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:23,690
happens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in agricultural</font>

148
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,699
communities so cultivation is huge

149
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,380
within their history and it's helping

150
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,690
out with marijuana future<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it really</font>

151
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,580
comes down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a few predominant</font>

152
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,620
families and town decided that they no

153
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">longer wanted recreational marijuana put</font>

154
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,419
together about initiative collected some

155
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:40,789
funding<font color="#CCCCCC"> from some different places that</font>

156
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:42,320
they're not being totally transparent

157
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,270
about but<font color="#E5E5E5"> regardless of that they</font>

158
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,590
collected funding to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

159
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,139
an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with enough signatures to get</font>

160
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,970
it actually on the ballot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and today is a</font>

161
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,699
huge day for myself and a ton of my

162
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,610
colleagues in Pueblo Colorado they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

163
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,169
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut down the recreational</font>

164
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:58,759
market within 12 months we would all

165
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,110
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shut down our recreational</font>

166
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,470
businesses this includes dispensaries

cultivation and marijuana use product

168
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,340
businesses leaving us only with the

169
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,870
medical market and the hip

170
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay which will absolutely make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no it's</font>

171
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,350
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can simply travel to</font>

172
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,570
another County or another city and pick

173
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,100
up the recreational marijuana and come

174
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,810
straight back to Pueblo sorry how

175
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,460
worried are you this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually kind of</font>

176
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,380
going to happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know by the end</font>

177
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,670
of today you might have to reconsider

178
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,090
how you're going to conduct<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

179
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,090
after 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> months well we have planned be</font>

180
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,620
in effect of course we're just going to

181
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to split our businesses and medical</font>

182
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,280
recommendation will go to another town

183
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,530
and start a business there they're

184
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,150
welcoming us more towns that are a lot

185
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,320
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> open to what we're doing of course</font>

186
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">but when this all started it made my</font>

187
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,790
ulcer go from the size of a nickel to

188
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> seismic quarter but to be honest</font>

189
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,890
back down without<font color="#CCCCCC"> sides to nickel but</font>

190
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,510
I'm talking to local people staying

191
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,160
applying it work with businesses and

192
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,990
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only had one opposition probably</font>

193
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the 35 different people I've spoken</font>

194
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,200
everybody understands what a huge

195
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,140
economic firmness is for pueblo which

196
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,790
has been struggling since the steel has

197
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,740
left in the 80s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 90s and move out of</font>

198

recognized all over the world has become

201
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,080
in capital for cannabis for the entire

202
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,240
so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep our fingers</font>

203
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">crossed and everybody we know the police</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">love you ty appreciate it that's</font>

210
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,290
interesting key I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so explain</font>

211
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,700
obviously you know we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

212
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,230
too many of the details about the kind

213
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,520
of money that will be funding the sort

214
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">of initiative but you know again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

215
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,520
would a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> county or a certain town</font>

216
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually rally together in this way</font>

217
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,370
particularly after it's been in effect

218
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,530
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last two years right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean the</font>

219
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,260
there is a tax benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> local</font>

220
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,200
counties in this but people are

221
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,280
conservatives in particular and law

222
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,530
enforcement still sees this as something

223
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> causes crime that brings crime</font>

224
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,300
whether or not that as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> result of</font>

225
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">legalization in colorado or the fact</font>

226
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it remains illegal in the</font>

227
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,300
neighboring states<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

228
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,910
people who are probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> pro-legalization</font>

229
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,500
would say that the solution is ending

230
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,030
prohibition nationwide to solve some of

231
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,470
the problems that what was interesting

232
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and a vote cast her out she</font>

233
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,650
told us earlier ken was mentioning about

234
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,790
some of the data they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

235
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,890
Colorado which is that if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Millennial</font>

236
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,350
vote that sort of 18 to 24

237
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,510
the numbers actually a lower than one

238
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,700
might expect in terms of turnout

239
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,140
obviously there is still about twenty

240
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,420
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the term out still to come</font>

241
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,100
but based on early voting about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighty</font>

242
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent early voting that we've already</font>

243
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,849
got from Colorado it looks like that 18

244
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:37,820
to 24 year old bracket is actually a

245
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,220
lower turnout that may be expected and

246
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,960
obviously as a bracket woman expect

247
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,600
might be a little bit more amenable to

248
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,160
to a marijuana initiative and wanted

249
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,390
perhaps kill this kind of amendment

250
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,760
absolutely all the polling just recently

251
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">in lead-up to the election there were</font>

252
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,130
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> poles that showed overwhelming</font>

253
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,840
support for marijuana legalization among

254
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,070
Millennials like seventy-seven percent

255
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,570
significant support so if it doesn't

256
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,180
happen this year perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we go the</font>

257
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,500
next election and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the election</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

258
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,420
that and those voters get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

259
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,770
older<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their turnout increases I</font>

260
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,350
think we can see and<font color="#E5E5E5"> expects marijuana</font>

261
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,090
to be legal eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

262
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,410
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hannah you mentioned Florida a</font>

263
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,090
little bit but let's turn our attention

264
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,940
to Florida so what's going on down<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

265
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,060
the Panhandle so Florida is a state that

266
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,590
has historically had some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

267
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,530
strict marijuana laws in the US along

268
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,110
with a lot of the deep south they've

269
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,970
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said earlier they voted against</font>

270
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,620
marijuana in the medical marijuana in

271
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,660
the past and now they've is back on the

272
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,750
ballot and they're reconsidering whether

273
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,390
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to allow pretty limited medical</font>

274
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,810
marijuana market for people with

275
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,010
legitimate conditions and there's a

276
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,440
pretty aggressive ad campaign going on

277
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,060
down in Florida I don't know if we've

278
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,680
got one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ads to show you do we</font>

279
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,170
have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ads to show everybody I</font>

280
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,190
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we do we don't have one of</font>

281
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,660
the ads but you can check it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out because</font>

282
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,130
there is a pretty aggressive ad campaign

283
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,470
going on down in Florida to try and kill

284
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,940
this proposed medical marijuana

285
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,560
initiative but for a lot of families

286
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,540
they say it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an absolute game</font>

287
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,180
changer if they had access to this and

288
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,290
