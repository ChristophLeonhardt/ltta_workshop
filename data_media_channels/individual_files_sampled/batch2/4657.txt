the president is standing firm on trade tariffs but our next guest is among the Republicans hoping he will reconsider joining us now member of the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees jeff flake of arizona so much to talk to you about this morning I'm just wondering are you the best person to try and change his mind on anything I can only try with Paul Ryan well if you look it's obviously bad policy we all think but we can disagree on that with a president he thinks is good policy but the politics of it are awful for Republicans I mean we have a conducive tax and regulatory environment now so the economy looks good going ahead that could all be reversed with a trade war and so I would hope that if he is unable to look at the policy side of it at least look at the politics I just think coming from Jeff Flake Willie that might be problematic but you never know Willie yes senator flake the president has made a habit over the last year and a half for 14 months whatever it's been out of his administration of saying something boldly and loudly in a meeting on TV and then eventually sort of stepping back from it he did it recently by guns after his meeting with the NRA do you believe actually there will be a 25% tariff on steal ten percent on aluminum the United States I don't know there is a phenomenon we saw it on immigration we've now seen it on guns where there's a Tuesday Trump versus the Thursday Tron I hope that there is a Thursday Trump on this issue where he says you know that that's that's just not a good way to go we cannot spark a trade war this is on a not a good way to prod the Mexicans or the Canadians into renegotiation of NAFTA NAFTA has been great for Mexico it's been great for Canada but it's also been great for us this is not a zero-sum game senator on another foreign policy issue here this morning he had a pretty extraordinary meeting between South Korea and North Korea Kim jong-un met with a high-level national security adviser in North Korea from South Korea and they talked about being willing North Korea did to talk to the United States to have a heart-to-heart meeting about denuclearization about if they got security guarantees they might step away from their nuclear program what should now happen from the United States we've said over and over there's no ambassador to South Korea from the United States the State Department's top diplomat on North Korea abruptly resigned last week what should fill this void right now what's our move well there's got to be a diplomacy I do hope that we get an ambassador we need a lot of post filth at the State Department this is encouraging news it's not definitive I mean I'm not sure that this will hold but it is encouraging to see that they're ready to talk and they want what you know virtually every country wants particularly a country like North Korea security guarantees and so that's a place to start at least so I hope that we get some actual negotiations going on in some some discussions do you believe North Korea is a good negotiating partner I don't know we'll have to see as we go forward but they're in a position that they haven't been before you know prior to now they haven't been seen as a legitimate nuclear threat now they are and so that really changes the game and so I think we're in unchartered territory here Jonathan Capehart senator I wanna switch gears for just a little bit and first to start off by thanking you for doing what so few are actually the overwhelming majority of your colleagues in your conference haven't done and that is calling out the President on a lot of the things that he's done why don't why do you think your other Republican colleagues haven't done what you've done which is they call out objective wrongs that the president has done or said more more important it's a tough place to be and if you're looking for re-election I can tell you you don't want to be on the other side of the president in any red state or red district so I mean it's it's a calculation certainly on people's part sure but isn't leadership part part of leadership doing the hard thing so you know you come to Washington just to be a lap dog not you but probably other for looking me for some example of somebody who's able to straddle that I I haven't been able to but but it is painful to watch you know some of this at least push back a little more I mean we've got our democracy is at risk David let me ask you about about dear party all the Republicans out there independents who voted for right for Donald Trump you have been as Jonathan said pretty outspoken and I'm curious whether you in your conversations with people see a crack in supporters people look at this daily circus in Washington whether people are being a say I've had enough of it and and whether we can look first at that sentiment to power the the midterm election is November I think it will every time I think I see that crack then the next week it's filth and people are right back in line you know several months ago when he went after Jeff Sessions I thought that'll be it that'll be particularly Jeff Sessions was in the Senate colleagues respected him for his position you know that's it but then you know what else and so every time I think I see that it kind of goes the other way ultimately yes I do think it'll be there if the president stays down in the 30s in popularity we're driving I mean young people have been walking away from the party for a while now they're in a dead sprint and and that has got to worry people and you know when these special elections you know whatever happens in Pennsylvania this month and other states in primaries to see primary turnout maybe that will jolt some people to realize you know we don't have a future as a party if we're driving away independence the marches coming up young people suburban women that it's remarks so you are headed to New Hampshire beautiful time of year to go to any other reason why you might go in a New Hampshire I got an invitation and I accepted it yes but I do want to talk about the direction of the party I am concerned about the direction of the party that I've been a member of my entire life I do have concerns about where we're going and I'll voice those concerns so that's what that's been well be watching Senator Jeff Flake thank you very much
