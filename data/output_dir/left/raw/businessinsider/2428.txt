00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:14,700
the prevailing view in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business</font>

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,560
world and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world at large was the</font>

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is not a commercial medium will</font>

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,710
never be a commercial medium it's not

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,300
for consumers ordinary<font color="#CCCCCC"> people won't use</font>

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,070
it and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no money to be made on it</font>

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,210
and people who are trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,650
internet-based businesses at that point

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,509
we're generally ridiculed by other

10
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:29,009
people saying no no that's not you know

11
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:31,169
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a joke in fact a lot of very</font>

12
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:32,310
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in the technology</font>

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,020
industry we're going out and being on

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,730
record in 1994's saying the internet

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,140
will never amount to anything it's a toy

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,220
it's a distraction don't pay any

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,900
attention to it some very famous and

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,720
prominent people were saying and so you

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,890
know and I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a newly minted</font>

20
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,360
college graduate like Who am I to argue

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,730
with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you know has a major media</font>

22
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,410
company sets of major phone company says

23
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,630
major technology companies and so it

24
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,370
wasn't until Jim Clark ultimately

25
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,630
reached out to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and said you know we</font>

26
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">should start a company that it sort of</font>

27
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,810
occurred to me of like oh but it so he

28
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,070

Clark just calls yeah and said we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,900

35
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,400
and says I'm Jim Clark and I said I know

36
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,730
who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are at that time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he had been the</font>

37
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,110
founder of Silicon Graphics Silicon

38
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,940
Graphics at that time was kind of in the

39
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">valley was what Google is today which is</font>

40
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,750
it was the best technology company in

41
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,890
the valley it was like the one that

42
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,300
everybody who was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sharp wanted to</font>

43
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,310
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and it turned out I was one of</font>

44
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,890
about a dozen people Jim approached to

45
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,960
start a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it turns out I was</font>

46
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,070
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one who was willing to take the</font>

47
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,820
leap so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when you left he took</font>

48
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">this leap did you have a product may did</font>

49
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,750
you know what you were going to build or

50
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,460
was it Jim just talked to everybody

51
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll figure it out when we get there we</font>

52
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,159
basically went through a process of

53
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">elimination if interactive TV is not</font>

54
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,550
going to be yet for you at least years

55
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,350
to come and if the game machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't</font>

56
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,850
going to be networked for years to come

57
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,770
which is what we concluded then the

58
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet by it's going to basically win</font>

59
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,030
by default<font color="#E5E5E5"> now bear in mind 1994 right</font>

60
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,920
April 1994 so first of all nobody

61
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,210
believed that anybody would buy any

62
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,470
suffer for the internet under any

63
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,479
circumstances no matter what number one

64
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,220
number two there had never been an ad

65
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,200
run on the internet ever right so there

66
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,878
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertising as a business model was</font>

67
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,310
not it was non-existent and considered

68
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,909
not possible so the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> we said was</font>

69
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,249
will be a software company and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll do</font>

70
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:18,599
the client's offer essentially as a loss

71
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,110
leader

72
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,880
and it nice exists clients offer new

73
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,230
successful doodles will give it away for

74
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,390
free will do it as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss leader and we</font>

75
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,250
will charge for the server software and

76
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,360
the fact that everybody's going to have

77
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,950
the browser means that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the companies</font>

78
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,820
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need the server software</font>

79
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,680
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> should actually turned out to be</font>

80
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,830
true now there was a twist on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it which</font>

81
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">was we did a dual license for the client</font>

82
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,460
we said let's run an experiment

83
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,870
basically and we said let's give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it away</font>

84
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,870
for essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> individually use as well</font>

85
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,000
as academic nonprofit use but let's put

86
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,350
a clause in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the license that says if you</font>

87
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,820
use it in a commercial environment if

88
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for business you have to pay</font>

89
00:02:49,020 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">for it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's see what happens</font>
