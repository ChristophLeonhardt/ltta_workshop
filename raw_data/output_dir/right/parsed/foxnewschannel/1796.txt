THE DEADLY STABBING SPREE.
LET'S GO TO BRYAN LLENAS WITH
MORE.
>> ISIS HAS RELEASED A NEW VIDEO
CLAIMING TO SHOW THE KNIFE
ATTACKER WHO STABBED FIVE PEOPLE
KILLING ONE LAST NIGHT IN
CENTRAL PARIS.
ISIS TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR
LAST NIGHT'S ATTACK, CALLING THE
KNIFEMAN A SOLDIER OF THE
CALIPHATE.
TODAY THEY RELEASED A 2 1/2
MINUTE VIDEO WHICH THEY SAY
SHOWS THE ATTACKER WHOSE FACE IS
COVERED, PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE TO
THE GROUP'S LEADER.
CHECHNYA'S PRESIDENT HAS
IDENTIFIED THE KNIFEMAN, A
20-YEAR-OLD FRENCH CITIZEN WHO
WAS BORN IN THE MUSLIM RUSSIAN
REPUBLIC.
ACCORDING TO REPORTING BY OUR
KATHERINE HERRIDGE, A CONTACT
TELLS HER THIS VIDEO PROVES THAT
IT IS BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE
THIS MAN WAS NOT NECESSARILY AN
INDEPENDENTLY INSPIRED ACTOR OR
SO CALLED LONE WOLF.
RATHER SOMEONE WHO HAD A MORE
DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH ISIS.
THIS ALL TOOK PLACE JUST BEFORE
10:00 P.M. LAST NIGHT IN CENTRAL
PARIS, NEAR THE MAIN OPERA
HOUSE, A POPULAR TOURIST SPOT
WITH RESTAURANTS AND BARS.
HE WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY POLICE
LAST NIGHT BUT NOT BEFORE HE
WOUNDED FOUR AND KILLED ONE JUST
BEFORE 10:00.
HE STABBED PEOPLE AT RANDOM.
SO FAR A FRIEND OF THE SUSPECT
HAS BEEN QUESTIONED.
SO TOO HAS THE SUSPECT'S PARENTS
WHO LIVE IN NORTHERN PARIS.
THE FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER
SAYS THERE COULD BE MORE ARRESTS
TO COME.
>> WE WILL DO EVERYTHING TO
IDENTIFY THE AUTHOR OF THE
ATTACK, TO BE ABLE TO EVENTUALLY
PUNISH THOSE WHO COULD HAVE
HELPED OR ASSISTED HIM.
>> ANOTHER POINT TO MENTION AS
WELL AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT,
HE WAS ON A TERROR WATCH LIST
THERE IN THAT COUNTRY, BUT HE
HAD NO CRIMINAL RECORD.
POLICE KNEW OF HIM, BUT AGAIN NO
