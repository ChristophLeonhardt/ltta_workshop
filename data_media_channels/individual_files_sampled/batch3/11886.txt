Facebook starting on the grilling from lawmakers this time in the UK the social media Giants been taken to task by MPs over the platform's handling of people's private data and questioned over Russian online activity around the time with a brexit vote I teach anastasiya Churkin has got the latest for you then Russian brexit could have been potentially a hot topic here in Westminster this Thursday however that did not go quite well as a grilling of a top Facebook executive didn't seem to go and produce too much we did look several times to understand connections between the IRA Russian IRA and the brexit referendum that you mention in 2016 we found one dollar of spend so this is the the extent of what we found which is you know almost nothing that could be done other ways you know I can't prove proven negative that was Facebook's chief technology officer who to add insult to injury was sent by Mark Zuckerberg to answer MP's questions despite repeated pleas to have the Facebook CEO appear before this committee himself and we have to be clear that this is far from the first time one attempts to connect the dots between Russia's use of social media and brexit have failed just previously we know that Facebook said that they have found that Russia had spent less than a dollar on any ads related to brexit and even when this committee traveled all the way to Washington to get more answers that did not produce very much we looked at all advertisements with any connection to Russia and we found no evidence of our services being used to interfere in the brexit referendum a very small number of suspected internet research agency linked accounts 49 such accounts were active during the referendum campaign which represents less than a naught point naught 5 percent of the total number of accounts that these are very low levels of engagement until we've completed this investigation we won't know but what we haven't had is information that's enabled us to target on a particular page or a particular phenomenon
