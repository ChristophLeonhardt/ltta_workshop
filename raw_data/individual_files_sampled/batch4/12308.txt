Trump goes into this meeting and we'll get to the question of whether he should have had the meeting at all in a minute but first of all this is the attitude he comes out afterwards and he makes a speech what they did is they signed a piece of paper that really doesn't mean very much at all it says it says that Kim is committed to do the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula but he already signed papers saying that so he's just recommitting to something he obviously lies about all the time that he didn't do so I just want to play one thing at the press conference afterwards that Trump said that gives you the idea of what Trump is thinking I think this is an actual real Trump as an example they have great beaches you see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean right if I said boy look at that wave what would that make a great condo behind and I explained I said you know instead of doing that you could have the best hotels in the world right there think of it from a real estate perspective you have South Korea you have China and they own the land in the middle how bad is that right it's great it's great real estate this is the way Trump is thinking they could set off a nuclear weapon and he'd be going like what are they doing they're ruining the beach you know what that you could build a three hotels on the beaches the guy who is going into this meeting
