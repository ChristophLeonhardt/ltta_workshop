one of rachel not least cabinet ministers is sad about the death of an attempted cop killer and if you didn't hear about this you can thank the mainstream media for keeping you in the dark I gave it a week you guys I thought a week was a good barometer I sought leaving this story for a week and then looking back on it would be a good way for me to gauge the bias of the mainstream media in favor of Rachel nollie and her cabinet her cadre of useless people now here's what I'm talking about this time last week Thursday actually UCP MLA Mike Ellis who also happens to be a former police officer himself was pressing the government about the secrecy surrounding the name of two people who were recently involved in two separate police shootings in Calgary on March 27th a man who robbed a convenience store shot constable Jordan for Jay now possible for Jays attacker was later found dead inside a burned garage on April 9th a man with a knife attacked an undercover police officer in Calgary the man was trying to rob the police officer unaware that he was a cop now the undercover cops shot and killed his attacker Alberta serious incident response team are the people who investigate all police involved shootings whereas the police officers involved are frequently identified a cert refuses to release the names of people who attack the police frequently citing privacy concerns for what they call victims of police shootings and specifically in the instance of the undercover police officer who was attacked and thankfully not identified so that his safety is not in jeopardy a cert said that they would not reveal the name of his attacker out of concern for the dead man's loved ones but they would say that he was a recently paroled 26 year old who was under conditions not to be in possession of weapons and save for one mainstream media reporter who works for the Calgary Sun a man named Brian pass a fume this exchange in the legislature missed the eyes of the reporters who are paid to watch the comings and goings at the legislature and also I'll say kudos to Lee Shakur Bella of the Calgary Herald for also pending an article that demands transparency not just for the police officers but for the public the names of these criminals should not be withheld to protect their families but I want to show you the exchange from the legislature that really got my blood boiling that's the one that I mentioned earlier I want to show you what NDP minister of community and social services were found Sabir said to Mike Ellis pay attention to who orphan Sabir is worried about it is going to make you sick just watch not knowing if the deceased man was a violent repeat offender out on bail and given that I have warned this Minister in this government that there's a broken bail hearing system and it is sending offenders back out and continuing to commit crimes and eroding public trust mr. speaker minister at this moment you're telling albertans that it is more important to protect the offender who shot a police officer rather than restoring public trust in the system will you do the right thing and release the deceased man's name Thank You mr. speaker and over thoughts of that was a operational decision made by the police and they make those decisions on a case-by-case basis they are the expert they are the person on the ground who work with them and provide them the support so they are able to do their work and did you catch that there were fancy beer is speaking on behalf of the entire government and he said that their thoughts are with the family and loved ones of the deceased the deceased in both of these instances are the dirtbags who tried to kill cops in the line of duty Sabir has sympathy for the devil but he has none for the officers and their families now while car Bella has plenty of righteous disdain for the policy that prevents the release of these attackers names I've got plenty of disdain for a government minister who has no words for the police who were nearly killed in attacks one of which is still fighting for his life in the hospital her fancy beer should be fired I'd like to fire that guy twice if I could Sameer is lucky enough to avoid the scrutiny of the majority of the mainstream media but I think everyone should know whose side he's really on for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read what you just saw there what you probably just enjoyed there is my daily video here at the rebel but I also do my own full-length show where I talk about issues facing Canadian families to get access to my show and the rest of our incredible premium content become a rebel subscriber today
