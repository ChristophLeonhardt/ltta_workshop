SEATTLE HAS A NEW PLAN TO AT
LEAST PARTIALLY DEMOCRATIZE
CAMPAIGN-FINANCE OR AN
EXPERIMENT TO MOVE IN THAT
DIRECTION ANYWAY, AND SOME
CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT HAPPY
ABOUT IT.
THEY HAVE A NEW DEMOCRACY
VOUCHER PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES
EVERY ELIGIBLE SEATTLE RESIDENT
WITH $100 IN TAXPAYER-FUNDED
VOUCHERS TO DONATE TO THE
CANDIDATES OF THEIR CHOICE.
THAT MEANS THAT THEORETICALLY,
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU
ARE ONE OF THE PRIVILEGED YOU
CAN GIVE THOUSANDS UPON
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN EVERY
ELECTION OR YOU ARE A
PERSON WHO EVEN GIVING 10 OR $20
IS DIFFICULT, YOU KNOW WILL HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXERCISE YOUR
SPEECH IN THE FORM OF MONEY.
THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED BY A
VOTER APPROVED BALLOT
MEASURE IN NOVEMBER 2015
AND IS FUNDED BY A 10 YEAR $30
MILLION PROPERTY TAX LEVY.
THAT IS WHERE THE TROUBLE IS
COMING FROM DOCTOR
REGISTERED VOTERS ARE
AUTOMATICALLY SENT TO VOUCHERS.
THOSE WHO ARE NOT REGISTERED AND
THOSE WITHOUT A PERMANENT
ADDRESS EDGES HOMELESS PEOPLE
CAN APPLY IN MELBOURNE
PRESENT THE CITY COMMISSION.
THIS ALSO ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO
REGISTER BECAUSE THEY WILL
GET ACCESS TO THAT FREE MONEY TO
PRODUCE PAY WITH, BUT IF YOU
AREN'T, YOU STILL CAN'T GET IT
OF COURSE WHICH IS GOOD TO SEE.
IT'S ARTIE MAKING A BIG
DIFFERENCE AT LEAST FOR
CERTAIN CANDIDATES.
JOHN GRANT IS A LEFTIST CITY
COUNCIL CANDIDATE.
HE HAS MADE THE VOUCHERS A
CENTERPIECE OF HIS CAMPAIGN
AND ACTIVISM IN REGARDS TO THE
HOMELESS SPECIFICALLY.
OF THE $145,933 IN DONATIONS
THAT HE IS RECEIVED, ALMOST
ALL OF IT HAS COME FROM THOSE
VOUCHERS AND SO COURSE HE
IS A BIG PROPONENT OF IT.
HE SAID SPECIFICALLY, I TOOK A
PLEDGE NOT TO ACCEPT ANY
MONEY FROM CORPORATIONS AND
DEVELOPERS.
I WANTED TO SHOW THAT DEMOCRACY
VOUCHERS CAN SUPPORT
GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGNS THAT WANT
TO ADDRESS THE STOMACH
ISSUES LIKE HOMELESSNESS.
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE
CITY HAVING ACCESS TO THESE
VOUCHERS A MEANS THAT CANDIDATES
WHO WANT TO GET ELECTED CITYWIDE
NOW THEY CAN'T JUST GO TO ONE OR
TWO BIG DONORS OR CORPORATIONS.
THEY THEORETICALLY CAN USE THE
SORT OF PATH THAT JOHN
KRANTZ OR BERNIE SANDERS HAVE
USED WERE YOU APPEALED TO THE
ACTUAL PEOPLE WHOSE VOICES WILL
BE AMPLIFIED BY THIS EXPERIMENT.
CONSERVATIVE SHOULD CELEBRATE
THIS BECAUSE THEY THINK MONEY A
SPEECH SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT
ALLOWS MORE PEOPLE TO SPEAK SO
CELEBRATING OUR FREEDOM OF
SPEECH AND THEY TOLD US
THAT NO, IT'S NOT THAT THE COKE
BROTHERS AND SHELDON ADELSON
AND ALL THOSE GUYS WANT TO JUST
LEGALLY BRIBE POLITICIANS.
NO, THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT,
THEY JUST WANT TO SPEAK
BECAUSE THEY LOVE FREEDOM OF
SPEECH.
SPEAKING.
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IN SEATTLE,
YOU HAVE FREEDOM OF SPEECH
BY THEIR DEFINITION, NO, WE
DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU SPEAK.
THEY ARE OPPOSED TO THIS
PROGRAM.
SO THERE IS A LAWSUIT.
THE LIBERTARIAN LAW FORM PACIFIC
LEGAL FOUNDATION IS REPRESENTING
TO SEATTLE HOMEOWNERS IN THE
LAWSUIT AGAINST THE CITY.
THEY ALLEGE THAT DEMOCRACY
VOUCHERS VIOLATE THEIR FIRST
AMENDMENT RIGHTS BECAUSE THE
TAXES ARE FUNDING CANDIDATES A
POSTOP FOR THE PARTICULAR PEOPLE
I'M SURE THAT THAT IS A BIG
THING BUT THE PROPERTY TAX BY
ITSELF IS GOING TO ALWAYS HAVE
REPERCUSSIONS, LEGAL
REPERCUSSIONS FROM THOSE
OUT TO PAY IT.
THIS IS BRILLIANT.
THE LAWSUIT SUCKS, BUT THE FACT
THAT PROPERTY TAXES ARE
BEING GIVEN, USES ROUTERS AND
BEING GIVEN TO HOMELESS
PEOPLE TO THEN BE ABLE TO VOTE
FOR THE CANDIDATE THEY WANT
IN THEIR CITY IS AMAZING.
I'M FROM SAN FRANCISCO.
WE HAVE A HORRIBLE, WERE
PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST
UNEQUAL CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE HAVE A TECH BOOM AND A RAGING
HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM AND IT
IS NOT GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON
AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SAN
FRANCISCO IMPLEMENT THIS.
YOU WILL SEE CHANGES.
THIS IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION,
IT'S AMAZING.
PROPERTY TAXES GIVEN TO HOMELESS
PEOPLE TO VOTE WITH THEIR
DOLLARS AND HAVE SPEECH WITH
MONEY IS THE ONLY SPEECH
THAT COUNTS OF COURSE.
YES.
NOW, I LOVE THAT LAWSUIT
BECAUSE OF HOW HILARIOUS IT
IS ON A COUPLE ACCOUNTS.
THEY SAY LOOK, BECAUSE OF THE
FIRST AMENDMENT, RICH PEOPLE GET
TO SPEAK IN ELECTIONS BY PUTTING
IN LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
INTO CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND
INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES.
THE FIRST AMENDMENT ALLOWS RICH
PEOPLE TO SPEAK.
THE FIRST AMENDMENT ALSO SHUT
SUPPORT PEOPLE BECAUSE
ACCORDING TO THIS LAWSUIT, THE
FIRST AMENDMENT, THEIR
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS, THE RICH
AND POVERTY PEOPLE FIRST
AMENDMENT RIGHTS MEANS YOU SHUT
THE HELL UP.
I'M NOT GIVING YOU ANY DEMOCRACY
VOUCHERS, WE'RE NOT DOING
PUBLIC FINANCING.
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET ANY
VOICE.
I GET ALL THE WAYS YOU GET NONE
OF IT.
YOU SEE HOW I BELIEVE IN THE
FIRST AMENDMENT.
IT'S AMAZING HOW THAT WORKS.
NOW ARE THEY GOING TO WIN
BECAUSE HE MAY GET SEDUCED INTO
AN ARGUMENT LIKE WAIT A MINUTE,
IF I'M OPPOSED TO SOMETHING
IN MY TAXES ARE USED FOR A
PROGRAM I DISAGREE WITH
MAYBE THAT DOES VIOLATE MY
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
HAS AN INTERESTING RING TO IT.
NO, YOUR TAXES ARE USED FOR
THINGS YOU DISAGREE WITH
ALL OF THE TIME.
MY TAXES WERE USED TO EVADE A
RACK.
I REALLY REALLY DISAGREE WITH
THAT.
JUST BECAUSE MY TAXES WERE USED
FOR THAT,
YOU SHOULD SUE.
COLLECTED BY LAWSUIT.
JUST BECAUSE I DISAGREED WITH
THE GOVERNMENT ACTION THAT
WAS TAKEN WITH MY TAXPAYER MONEY
DOESN'T MEAN THEY ELATED MY
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
I COULD ALSO SPEAK OUT AGAINST
THE IRAQ WAR AND DID.
THAT IS MY FIRST AMENDMENT
RIGHT, NOTHING YOU GET TO
USE TAXES FOR ONLY THE THINGS I
AGREE WITH.
BY THE WAY, CONSERVATIVES, YOU
WANT TO REALLY TINGLE WITH
THAT ONE?
LET'S GO TO THE POLLS AND FIND
OUT WHAT THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FAVOR OF AND
IF YOU DO ANYTHING OPPOSITE
TO THAT LIKE TAX CUTS FOR THE
RICH, SORRY, YOU VIOLATED
OUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
SUBSIDIES, YOU TAKE OUR TAXPAYER
MONEY AND GIVE ITS OIL
COMPANIES, THE MOST PROFITABLE
RICHEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD?
SORRY, YOU VIOLATED MY FIRST
AMENDMENT RIGHTS, I DON'T
AGREE WITH THAT.
THAT IS NOT A REAL LEGAL CLAIM,
IT'S JUST A WAY TO TRY TO SHUT
REGULAR PEOPLE UP AND MAINTAIN
POWER ONLY FOR THE RICH.
LIBERTARIAN LAW FIRM?
HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE THERE?
WHERE IS THE LAWSUIT AGAINST ALL
THIS DARK MONEY, AGAINST
THE COKE BROTHERS?
HONESTLY, THIS IS THE
LIBERTARIAN SORT OF INSANE
CIRCLE JERK THAT IS JUST LIKE
WHEN ARE WE DECRYING ALL
THE MONEY THAT IS IN OUR
POLITICS HERE?
DEVILS ADVOCATE, POSSIBLY,
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU ARE
ON THE PANEL.
1ST OF ALL HE WANT TO SAY THAT
THESE SORTS OF EXPERIMENTS
HAPPENING IN CITY AND STATES I
THINK IS ONE OF THE BEST
THINGS ABOUT AMERICA, THAT WE
CAN DO THIS, THAT'S WHY IT
MAKES HIM ANY VIDEOS ABOUT THE
EXPERIMENTS WITH INCOME AND
THE HIGHER MINIMUM WAGES AND
CITIES, ALL OF THAT.
DEVILS ADVOCATE THOUGH,
THEORETICALLY, AND I KNOW THAT
THEY ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE,
IF THE PROBLEM IS MONEY IN
POLITICS, IS THE SOLUTION MORE
MONEY AND POLITICS?
BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM DOES SORT
OF SAY MONEY IS SPEECH,
SPEECHES MONEY.
OKAY, HOLD ON.
IT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD QUESTION.
THAT IS WAY ACTUALLY, I AM NOT
SPENDING TIME OR ENERGY, MEANING
WHAT
I PUSH FOR IN WOLFPAC IN THIS
DIRECTION BECAUSE I THINK WE
SHOULD GO IN THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION OF MONEY IS NOT SPEECH
AND WE SHOULD JUST PUBLICLY
FINANCE ALL ELECTIONS PERIOD.
NO PRIVATE FINANCING.
I AM NOT GIVING YOU $100 VOUCHER
WHILE THE KOCH BROTHERS HAVE
$400 MILLION THEY ARE GOING TO
PUT INTO THIS ELECTION CYCLE.
I'M GOING TO TAKE ALL THE MONEY
OUT.
IF YOU PRIVATELY FINANCED
ELECTIONS, YOU WILL HAVE
REPRESENTATIVES WORKING FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO FINANCE THEM.
IF YOU PUBLICLY FINANCED
ELECTIONS, THEY MIGHT
ACTUALLY WORK FOR YOU, THE
PUBLIC.
ONE THING THAT IS OVERPLAYED
IN MY OPINION ABOUT THIS
LEGISLATION IS THAT PEOPLE KEEP
TALKING ABOUT THE HOMELESS,
BUT NO, EVERYBODY GETS A
VOUCHER.
THE HOMELESS ALSO GET IT WHICH
IS AMAZING BECAUSE IN OUR
WORLD WE ARE LIKE, HOMELESS, ARE
YOU EVEN HUMAN?
YES,
WE TREATED THEM AS HOMO SAPIENS,
GREAT, AMAZING.
BUT EVERYBODY GETS A VOUCHER.
YOU ARE A CARPENTER, A SMALL
BUSINESS OWNER, WORK FOR
MINIMUM WAGE, YOU GET ONE.
IT IS NOT MY PREFERRED
ROUTE, BUT IT IS WAY BETTER
THAN THE CURRENT SYSTEM SO I
WANT TO SUPPORT ALL THE PEOPLE
DOING DIFFERENT KINDS OF
EXPERIMENTATION TO GET TO THE
RIGHT ANSWER.
I HAPPEN TO THINK THERE'S A
LITTLE BIT OF OVEREMPHASIS
ON THIS PARTICULAR TRACK, BUT
THEY GOT IT DONE IN SEATTLE AND
I WANT THEM TO SUCCEED AND MAYBE
BY THE WAY, MAYBE THAT IS A
BETTER TRACK.
LET'S FIND OUT.
IT'S CERTAINLY WAY BETTER THAN
WHAT WE HAVE NOW.
IT AT LEAST EVENS THE PLAYING
FIELD A LITTLE BIT SO GREAT
CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE WHO GOT IT
DONE AND IF THE COURTS REJECT
THIS, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
THE PROBLEM WITH THE COURTS IS
THAT POLITICIANS APPOINT
THEM AND POLITICIANS ARE NOW
ALMOST COMPLETELY CORRUPTED
AND IT IS GOING UPSTREAM
TOWARD THE COURTS AND IT HAS,
THAT'S WHY THE SUPREME COURT
IS CORRUPTED.
WE HAVE TO HURRY.
THAT IS WHY, AGAIN, I WANT AN
AMENDMENT TO END ALL OF
THIS NONSENSE.
THE ONLY THING ABOVE THE COURTS
AS AN AMENDMENT.
LET'S DO BOTH THOUGH.
IF YOU ARE DOING THIS, GODSPEED
TO YOU AND WE ALL HAVE YOUR
BACK, BUT LET'S ALSO MAKE SURE
WE GET AN AMENDMENT TO END
ALL THE NONSENSE.
WOLFÃ±PAC.COM TO DO THAT.
