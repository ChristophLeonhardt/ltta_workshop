THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

30
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,982
BRIDGE THE GAP ON POSITION, BUT

31
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:10,420

42
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:38,114
STOP THE SUMMIT FROM HAPPENING,

43
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:39,849
WE KNOW THAT MUCH.

44
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,750
IT'S SIGNIFICANT TO POINT OUT

45
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,785
WHO IS NOT IN THE ROOM.

46
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:48,658

ON THURSDAY BUT HE'S NOT GOING

52
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,907
TO BE IN SINGAPORE EITHER.

53
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:07,743
THOSE THREE FIGURES SHAPE THE

54
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:11,581
WAY THINGS WILL TRANSPIRE GOING

55
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:11,914

00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:26,963
FLYING ON CHINA AIR.

60
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:28,564
>> HE'S BASICALLY SAYING HE'S

61
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:29,198
OUR GUY.

62
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:30,133
DON'T MESS WITH HIM.

63
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,234
THAT'S A MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT

64
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,668
TRUMP.

65
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:36,038
FOR US, XI JINPING HAS BEEN A

66
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:36,706
MALIGN INFLUENCE.

67
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:37,874
OVER LAST 3 MONTHS OR SO THEY

68
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:39,308
HAVE BEEN BUSTING SANCTIONS ON

69
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:40,343
NORTH KOREA AND THEY'VE BEEN

70
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:41,444
DOING IT OPENLY.

71
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:42,111
THAT'S REALLY A WARNING TO

72
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:43,112
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

73
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:45,147
NOW, WE CAN IGNORE THAT,

74
00:02:45,147 --> 00:02:46,449
HEATHER, IF THINGS GO WELL WITH

75
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:47,950
NORTH KOREA BUT IF THEY DON'T

76
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,519
IT'S BECAUSE OF CHINA'S

77
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:50,886
INFLUENCE.

78
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:52,321
WE HAVE TO IMPOSE COST ON

79
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:55,791
BEIJING FOR MESSING UP THE

80
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:56,125
SUMMIT.

81
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,026
HEATHER: HOW DO YOU THINK THE

82
00:02:57,026 --> 00:02:58,627
SUMMIT IS GOING TO GO?

83
00:02:58,627 --> 00:03:00,229
>> I HOPE WE GET A FIRM

84
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:02,331
COMMITMENT FROM NORTH KOREANS TO

85
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:03,866
DISMANTLE NUCLEAR WEAPON'S

86
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,034
PROGRAM BUT CERTAINLY DOESN'T

87
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:06,669
LOOK LIKE THAT WAY, PRESIDENT

88
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,671
TRUMP AND SECRETARY OF STATE

89
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:10,506
POMPEO HAVE BEEN LOWERING

90
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:11,407
EXPECTATIONS SAYING IT'S REALLY

91
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:13,642
A MEET AND GREET, THE FIRST OF

92
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:16,245
THE BEGINNING OF SUMMITS AN LONG

93
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:16,579
PROCESS.

94
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,646
HEATHER: WE HEARD THAT PRESIDENT

95
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:18,948
TRUMP IS GOING TO INVITE KIM

96
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,851
JONG UN TO MAR-A-LAGO, WE HEARD

97
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:24,386
THAT KIM JONG UN HAS PERSONALLY

98
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:25,487
INVITED PRESIDENT TRUMP TO COME

99
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:30,392
TO PYONGYANG, SO OBVIOUSLY

100
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:31,760
THEY'RE ANTICIPATING THIS AND

101
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,195
MOVING FORWARD?

102
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:33,629
>> CERTAINLY.

103
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:38,767
ONE THING THAT KIM JONG UN WANTS

104
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:40,169
LEGITIMIZATION.

105
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:41,070
HEATHER: I WANTED TO ASK YOU

106
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,570
THAT.

107
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,939
>> THEY'LL BE SHOWING THOSE

108
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:44,673
PHOTOGRAPHS AS LONG AS KIM JONG

109
00:03:44,673 --> 00:03:45,774
UN IS THE RULER.

110
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:47,342
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT THING.

111
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:48,310
NOW WE'VE GIVEN THAT UP.

112
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,312
WE HAVE TO GET SOMETHING IN

113
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:50,646
RETURN.

114
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:51,580
QUESTION, ARE WE GOING TO GET

115
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,282
THAT NOW OR ARE WE GOING TO GET

116
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:53,916
IT LATER.

117
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,617
IF WE GET IT LATER, THE PROBLEM

118
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:57,686
IS THAT WE'VE HANDED HIM A

119
00:03:57,686 --> 00:04:00,122
VICTORY WHICH MEANS WE NOW HAVE

120
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:01,290
LESS LEVERAGE BECAUSE HE WANTS

121
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,324
LESS FROM US.

122
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:05,027
FOR US, THIS IS GOING TO BE A

123
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:07,663
VERY TRICKY VERY INTRICATE DANCE

124
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:09,031
NOT ONLY WITH NORTH KOREANS BUT

125
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:11,800
ALSO WITH THE CHINESE AND TO A

126
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,236
CERTAIN EXTENT MOON JAE-IN

127
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:15,404
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN SUPPORTING KIM

128
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:15,738
JONG UN.

129
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,606
WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE

130
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:18,974
OTHER SIDE AND ON OUR SIDE OF

131
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:20,209
THE FENCE WE HAVE THE JAPANESE

132
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,142
PRIME MINISTER.

133
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:22,478
HEATHER: YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

134
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:23,445
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS FOR

135
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:23,846
SURE.

136
00:04:23,846 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN
