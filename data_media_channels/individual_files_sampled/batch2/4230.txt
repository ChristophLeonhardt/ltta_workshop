the defendants accessed email accounts of volunteers and employees of a u.s. presidential campaign including the campaign chairman starting in March of 2016 that campaign chairman was John Podesta the chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign for president and John Podesta joins our discussion now from California and John Podesta first of all thank you very much for joining us on this really important night and I just want to read for the audience select the portion of the indictment that describes how the Russians attacked you and how they got to you the indictment says that on March 19 2016 a Russian military officer and his co-conspirators created and sent a spear phishing email to the chairman of the Clinton campaign they used the account John three five six G H at an online service that abbreviated lengthy website addresses referred to as a shortening service they used the account to mask a link contained in the spear phishing email which directed the recipients to a GRU created web site the military officer altered the appearance of the sender email address in order to make it look like the email was a security notification from Google a technique known as spoofing instructing the user to change his password by clicking the embedded link those instructions were followed on or about March 21st 2016 the officers and their co-conspirators stole the contents of the Chairman's email account which consisted of over fifty thousand emails and John Podesta I can't help but wondering I wonder what it felt like today when you read that portion of the email with that line that says the those instructions were followed do you remember that moment where you clicked on John three five six GH well Lawrence there's a little bit more of a backstory to that but I think that the general observations of this have been well known that there was a spearfishing involved my assistant and in in my office but at any rate what's important is at the heart of this was a conspiracy which is laid out in this indictment crimes were committed by officers of Russian intelligence that was done at the direction of Vladimir Putin as our intelligence community has discerned there were allegations of money laundering of computer fraud and abuse of conspiracy it involves conversations with American individuals and you know still we get nothing from Donald Trump this was I think profoundly an attack on me personally and of course that's painful but more importantly more importantly it was an attack on America's democracy and I you know I grieved for the country really now you work for two presidents you were in the White House working for Bill Clinton working for President Obama what would President Obama do today about this and especially what if President Obama had a meeting scheduled with President Putin on Monday what would what would President Obama do well I think once this well first of all I think we have to step back a bit and say that mr. Rosas stayed briefed President Trump before he left on this trip and yet he decided to go forward with this meeting with Putin with no discernible agenda in front of him an attempt to suck up to him I guess it's a little unclear what he intends to get out of it but we know what President Obama would have done because when he was faced with the situation where he was supposed to meet with President Putin and President Putin permitted the the person who had hacked into the national security information in our country he canceled that meeting there have been calls for Trump to go ahead and cancel the meeting with Putin I doubt he's going to do that but more importantly I doubt he's going to really confront a President Putin you know he's blown it off on his trip through Europe he's compared it to Perry Mason he said I'll you know I'll ask the question again that the press wants me to ask but when President Obama was faced with President Putin admitting Edward Snowden to to Russia then President Putin Obama took the step of canceling that meeting he took the steps of sanctioning the Russians after became known that they had interfere with our election I don't see any of that coming from President Trump from the get-go in this campaign he has tried to really to adopt the Russian foreign policy to to dismiss what Putin has done in Ukraine and Crimea etc and now to completely dismiss the indictments that that Muller has brought forward the guilty pleas from from his national security adviser so you know I'm not expecting much from President Trump but one can only hope that he'll put America first and push forward with trying to get some resolution maybe a first step would be to ask Putin to extradite those 12 military officials who were indicted today in a US Court yeah the Trump Justice Department has accused these Russian military officers of committing a crime against you personally along with other people but a specific crime against you personally do you believe you have a right to have your interests represented by the president the United States and demand extradition of those people accused of those crimes so that you can face them in a courtroom in America I have a right but I have low expectation that'll do it I have to say you know I think again his course of conduct has been to dismiss this you know he constantly refers to a investigation that's already yield 35 indictments as a witch-hunt and I all I have to say is that the hunters are finding a lot of witches and a lot of them are connected to battle Trump John Podesta thank you very much for joining us tonight I know it was not easy for you to do that and really appreciate you being with us thank you very much no problem Lawrence thanks thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC
