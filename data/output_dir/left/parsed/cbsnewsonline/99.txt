TO WORK WHO ARE STILL WORKING 
THERE TODAY. 
AFTER SELLING THAT IN 1997 I 
RAN FOR CONGRESS IN 1998 IN THE 
NIAGARA FALLS AREA KNOWING THAT 
MY BUSINSS EXPERIENCE WOULD 
BENEFIT THE CITIZENS OF NEW YORK
AND OFFER A NEW PERSPECTIVE IN 
CONGRESS. 
AFTER BEING HUMBLED IN THAT 
RACE I SPENT THE NEXT 10 YEARS 
AS AN ENTREPRENEUR INVESTING IN 
AND HELPING TO STABILIZE DOZENS 
OF BANKRUPT AND FINANCIALLY 
DISTRESSED COMPANIES, SAVING 
AND CREATING HUNDREDS OF JOBS 
HERE IN WESTERN NEW YORK. 
IN 2007 I WAS RECRUITED TO RUN 
FOR ERIE COUNTY EXECUTIVE TO 
TURN AROUND THE EFFECTIVE 
BANKRUPT COUNTY. 
I WAS ELECTED AND BY APPLYING 
PRINCIPLES TURNED AROUND THE 
FINANCES IN 18 MONTHS. 
ALL THE WHILE HONORING MY 
CAMPAIGN PLEDGE TO WORK FOR ONE 
DOLLAR A MONTH. 
ONE OF THE MANY COMPANIES I 
INVESTED IN WAS A SMALL DRUG 
DEVELOPMENT COMPANY THAT WAS 
WORKING ON A UNIQUE CURE FOR 
HIV PATIENTS SUFFERING WITH 
AIDS. 
ULTIMATELY THAT FOCUS SHIFTED 
TO A TREATMENT FOR SECONDARY 
PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, 
WHICH IS ONE OF THE DEADLIEST 
AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES KNOWN. 
MY AFFILIATION WITH THIS 
COMPANY IS WHY WE ARE HERE 
TODAY. 
I HAVE BEEN AN AVID AND 
UNWAVERING SUPPORTER OF IMMUNO 
THERAPEUTICS LONG BEFORE I CAME 
TO CONGRESS OR BEFORE I WAS AN 
EXECUTIVE HERE. 
OVER THIS TIME MY AFFILIATION 
WITH THE COMPANY HAS HAD 
ATTACKS ON MY -- I BELIEVED IN 
THE COMPANY AND I STILL DO. 
AND IN THE POTENTIAL OF A DRUG 
THAT HAD THE REAL POSSIBILITY 
OF IMPROVING THE TREATMENT 
OPTIONS FOR SECONDARY 
PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS 
PATIENTS, WHICH IS ABOUT THE 
MOST DEBILITATING DISEASE KNOWN 
TO MANKIND AND SOMETHING I SAW 
FIRSTHAND AFFECT A CLOSE FAMILY 
MEMBER. 
OVER THE YEARS I INVESTED 
HEAVILY IN THE COMPANY AND 
BECAME THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER 
AND AN UNCOMPENSATED MEMBER OF 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 
WITHOUT MY INVESTMENTS THE 
COMPANY WOULD HAVE GONE UNDER 
BRINGING WITH IT A PREMATURE 
END TO A DRUG THAT I THOUGHT 
WOULD REVOLUTIONIZE TREATMENT 
OPTIONS FOR SECONDARY 
PROGRESSIVE MS. OF ALL THE 
THINGS I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IN 
MY LIFE FINDING A CURE FOR 
SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE MS WAS AT 
THE TOP OF THE LIST. 
AFTER YEARS OF BLOOD, SWEAT, 
AND TEARS, WE FIRMLY BELIEVED 
WE WERE ON THE VERGE OF A 
MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH. 
SADLY, DESPITE SHOWING GREAT 
INITIAL PROMISE, THE DRUG WAS 
SHOWN TO BE UNSUCCESSFUL, WHICH 
IS A SETBACK FOR ALL OF THOSE 
SUFFERING FROM THIS DEADLY 
DISEASE. 
MANY HAVE SPECULATED ABOUT MY 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY. 
HERE ARE THE SIMPLE FACTS. 
MY CONNECTIONS ARE WELL KNOWN 
AND I BELIEVE I ACTED PROPERLY 
AND WITHIN THE LAW AT ALL TIMES 
WITH REGARD TO MY AFFILIATION 
WITH THEM. 
THROUGHOUT MY TENURE IN 
CONGRESS I HAVE FOLLOWED ALL 
RULES AND ETHICAL GUIDELINES 
WHEN IT COMES TO MY PERSONAL 
INVESTMENTS INCLUDING THOSE 
WITH THIS COMPANY. 
WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE 
DRUG THAT I BELIEVED IN FELL 
SHORT OF OUR HOPES AND 
EXPECTATIONS I HELD ONTO MY 
SHARES RATHER THAN SELL THEM. 
AS A RESULT THE SIGNIFICANT 
INVESTMENT I MADE IN THE COMPANY
WERE WIPED OUT. 
THAT IS OKAY. 
THAT IS THE RISK THAT I TOOK. 
MY REAL CONCERN LIES WITH THE 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SUFFERING 
FROM SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE MS 
WHO TO THIS DAY STRUGGLE 
WITHOUT LIFE-SAVING TREATMENTS 
FOR THE DEADLY DISEASE. 
I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE AND I 
WILL SAY IT AGAIN, I AM PROUD 
OF MY AFFILIATION AND I MAY 
HAVE LOST MOST OF THE MONEY 
THAT I INVESTED WITH THE 
COMPANY, BUT I TOOK THE CHANCE 
TO BRING RELIEF WITH THOSE WHO 
DEAL WITH THIS DREADFUL DISEASE 
OF SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE MS 
EVERY DAY. 
THE CHARGES THAT HAVE BEEN 
LEVIED AGAINST ME ARE MERITLESS 
AND I WILL MOUNT A DEFENSE TO 
CLEAR MY NAME. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING FULLY 
VINDICATED AND EXONERATED 
ENDING ANY AND ALL QUESTIONS 
RELATING TO MY AFFILIATION WITH 
THIS COMPANY. 
I'VE SPENT THE LAST 10 YEARS IN 
PUBLIC SERVICE AS A MEMBER OF 
CONGRESS. 
I HAVE ALSO SPENT MANY YEARS 
VOLUNTEERING TO GET BACK TO MY 
COMMUNITY. 
WHETHER IT WAS A MEMBER OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OR A MEMBER
OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE 
KENMORE HOSPITAL, THE PUBLIC 
KNOWS MY DEDICATION TO WESTERN 
NEW YORK. 
BECAUSE MY FOCUS IS TO DEFEAT 
THE CHARGES IN COURT, AFTER 
TODAY I WILL NOT ADDRESS ANY 
ISSUES RELATED TO INNATE  
OUTSIDE OF THE COURTROOM. 
AS I FIGHT TO CLEAR MY NAME, 
REST ASSURED I WILL CONTINUE TO 
WORK HARD FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE 
27th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF 
NEW YORK AND I WILL REMAIN ON 
THE BALLOT RUNNING FOR 
REELECTION THIS NOVEMBER. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.
>> THAT WAS CONGRESSMAN CHRIS 
COLLINS CALLING THE CHARGES OF 
INSIDER TRADING MERITLESS. I 
BELIEVE I ACTED PROPERLY AND 
WITHIN THE LAW HE SAID AND THAT 
DID NOT REALLY ADDRESS THE 
CHARGES AGAINST HIM. 
HE POINTED OUT THAT HE HELD 
ONTO ALL HIS SHARES WHEN HE HAD 
THIS INFORMATION AND THAT A KEY 
DRUG TRIAL HAD GONE BAD FOR 
THIS COMPANY AND HE WAS THE 
LARGEST SHAREHOLDER AND SAID HE 
LOST MILLIONS BECAUSE HE HELD 
ONTO THOSE SHARES. 
IS THAT THE DEFENSE FOR THE 
CHARGES MADE AGAINST HIM?>> NO. 
HE IS MAKING A STRONG CASE FOR 
WHY HE BELIEVED IN THE COMPANY 
AND THE DRUG. 
THE PROBLEM IS HE IS CHARGED 
WITH A MULTITUDE OF CRIMES AND 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER HE 
LOST MONEY OR NOT. 
HE WAS NOT LEGALLY ABLE TO SELL 
THOSE SHARES BECAUSE OF A 
NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING 
BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE 
ETHICS COMMISSION. 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS HE 
HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH 
CONSPIRACY AND LYING TO THE FBI 
AND WIRE FRAUD IN ALL OF THIS 
REALLY DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE 
WHAT HE ULTIMATELY IS ACCUSED 
OF DOING IS TAKING NONPUBLIC 
INFORMATION AND SHARING IT WITH 
ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL AND THAT 
PERSON TRADED ON THAT 
INFORMATION. 
THAT IS THE KEY FACT OF THIS 
CASE. 
>> WALK US THROUGH SOME OF 
THESE FACTS.>> HE GETS AN EMAIL 
FROM THE CEO OF THIS COMPANY 
ÃºS 
WE KNOW IN A WRITTEN EMAIL BACK 
HE WAS SURPRISED BY THE RESULTS.
15 SECONDS TO ONE MINUTE LATER 
HE MAKES A PHONE CALL TO HIS 
SON. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PHONE 
CALL IS, BUT IF YOU PUT TWO AND 
TWO TOGETHER, YOU KNOW WHAT IT 
LOOKS LIKE. 
THE SON THEN TAKES PROACTIVE 
STEPS TO SELL THE STOCK. 
HIS FIANCC IMMEDIATELY LOGS 
ONTO HER BROKERAGE ACCOUNT AND 
THE NEXT MORNING AFTER HAVING 
THIS CONVERSATION, HE DUMPS THE 
STOCK. 
HE KEEPS ON LOADING AND 
UNLOADING IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING 
AND HE COUPLES THAT WAS 
CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS FATHER 
AND WE KNOW THAT FROM THE PHONE 
LOGS. 
IN A CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE 
CASE IT IS VERY STRONG.
>> YOU ARE CHRIS COLLINS 
DEFENSE ATTORNEY. 
WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, THE ELECTIONS 
ARE COMING UP IN NOVEMBER AND 
OCTOBER 11 IS A STATUS HEARING. 
I WILL TRY TO PROLONG ANY 
DISCOVERY. 
LET'S PUSH THIS PAST NOVEMBER 
AND HAVE A CLEAN PUBLIC IMAGE 
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. 
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE HELP. 
-- HELPED. 
IN THE MEANTIME, WHAT DOES THE 
PROSECUTION HAVE? 
TEXT MESSAGES? 
IT COULD BE THE STRONGEST 
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE CASE 
BUT I'VE SEEN CASES FALL APART. 
AT THE SAME POINT, WHEN YOU HAVE
THIS VERY STRONG TIMELINE AND 
THIS VERY SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR, 
I HAVE SEEN IT GO THE OTHER 
WAY. 
IT IS A TRICKY SCENARIO AND YOU 
MIGHT SEE A PLEA DEAL, IT LOOKS 
UNLIKELY.>> YOU SAY YOU'VE SEEN 
CASES LIKE THIS FALL APART. 
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? 
>> THE JURY WILL SAY AM I 
REALLY CAN FIND HIM GUILTY IF I 
DON'T HAVE THE ULTIMATE 
INFORMATION? 
MAYBE THE DEFENSE CAN RAISE 
ENOUGH REASONABLE DOUBT, 
BECAUSE REMEMBER, IT IS NOT 
JUST HAVING THE MATERIAL, BUT 
IT IS ACTING ON THAT 
INFORMATION AND TRADING ON IT. 
CAN THEY PRESENT ENOUGH DEFENSE 
TO SAY LOOK AT THE TRADING 
PATTERNS OF HIS SON AND HE 
TRADE LIKE THIS BEFORE? 
IT MIGHT BE A STRETCH WHAT WE 
SEE IN THE INDICTMENT, BUT THE 
DEFENSE HAS WORK TO DO.>> ARE 
THESE CODEFENDANTS THAT YOU 
BOTHER TRYING TO FLIP?
>> WHAT A FAMILY DYNAMIC THIS 
IS. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FAMILY 
INDICTMENT THERE IS NUMEROUS 
AMOUNT OF UNINDICTED, NOT NAMED 
CO-CONSPIRATORS. 
THEY ARE CHRIS COLLINS SONS 
FIANCC, THE FIANCCS MOTHER AND 
THE BROTHER OF THE FIANCCS 
FATHER, THIS WHOLE FAMILY 
CONNECTION. 
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLICATED 
BUT THEY HAVE HAD TO PAY FINES 
BY THE SEC. 
IF YOU LOOK AT A TRIAL, ARE 
THEY GOING TO TESTIFY AGAINST 
THE COLLINS? 
THEY AREN'T MARRIED YET. 
SO THE SPOUSAL PRIVILEGE DOES 
NOT APPLY AT.
>> WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY GET 
MARRIED BEFORE THE TRIAL?>> CAN 
SHE TESTIFY AGAINST HER 
HUSBAND? 
PROBABLY NOT. 
BUT ARE THEY HAVING 
CONVERSATIONS RIGHT NOW ABOUT 
SAVING YOURSELF AND YOU HAVE TO 
SAVE ME? 
HER FATHER HAS BEEN NAMED IN 
THIS INDICTMENT BUT THE WIFE 
AND HIS DAUGHTER HAVE NOT BEEN. 
IT IS A REALLY WEIRD SCENARIO. 
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.>> THEY 
MIGHT HAVE TO REPRINT THE SAVE 
THE DATE. 
HE TRIED TO PORTRAY THE STORY 
OF A GUY CARING ABOUT A 
TERRIBLE DISEASE. 
AS WE POINT OUT, HE DIDN'T SELL 
HIS SHARES, WHICH DOES NOT GO 
TO THE HEART OF THE CASE 
AGAINST HIM. 
DO YOU THINK THAT STORY THAT WE 
JUST HEARD, IS THAT SOMETHING 
YOU CAN SPIN IN FRONT OF A 
JURY?>> I THINK IT IS A GREAT 
AVENUE TO SPEND, ESPECIALLY IF 
HE GETS CONVICTED WHEN THE JURY 
HAS TO DECIDE. 
THEY WILL TAKE THE SOUNDBITE 
AND THEY WILL USE IT LATER ON. 
AND THERE IS NOT MUCH HE CAN DO 
RIGHT HERE. 
HE SAID I DON'T WANT TO 
LITIGATE THIS IN THE COURT OF 
PUBLIC OPINION. 
THAT IS VERY SMART. 
THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S NOT MUCH 
MORE HE CAN SAY. 
DO I BELIEVE THAT HE BELIEVED 
IN THIS COMPANY AND HE WANTED 
IT TO WORK? 
ABSOLUTELY. 
BUT THAT WILL NOT HELP HIM FROM 
A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE.>> JESSE 
WEBER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
YOUR INSIGHTS.
