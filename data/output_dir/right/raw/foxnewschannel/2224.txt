00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:09,652

MORRISEY AND HIS FAMILY LOBBYING

IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,360
CARDINAL HEALTH, NOT OUR STATE

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,562
TO BIRD, IT IS THE PUSHER OF ALL

9
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:22,965
OF THESE PILLS.

10
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:25,368
HE AND HIS FAMILY LOBBYING FIRM

LOBBYIST AND HILL STAFFORD.

14
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:35,177
THEY HAVE FLOODED OUR STATE WITH

15
00:00:35,177 --> 00:00:37,380
THESE PAIN PILLS THAT HAVE

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:37,947
DEVASTATED PEOPLE IN

17
00:00:37,947 --> 00:00:38,381
WEST VIRGINIA.

18
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:40,349
IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT THE

19
00:00:40,349 --> 00:00:43,586
PROBLEM IS, IT IS THE PILL

20
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:44,587
PUSHERS AND PATRICK MORRISEY IS

00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:45,655
REPRESENTING THOSE PEOPLE FOR

22
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:48,357
YEARS AND MADE MILLIONS.

23

>> Bret: OUR FIRST BELL OF THE

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,962
EVENING, BUT MR. MORRISEY.

25
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:54,664
>> THERE HE GOES YET AGAIN, DID

26
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:56,799
YOUR MOM EVER TELL YOU THAT WE

27
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,335
SHOULD WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT WITH

28
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:01,170
SOAP WITH THOSE LIES?

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:01,737
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

30
00:01:01,737 --> 00:01:02,805
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, OBVIOUSLY

31
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:04,407
NOT ONLY PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE DID

32
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:05,408
NOT WORK ON THOSE ISSUES IN THE

33
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:07,877
PRIVATE SECTOR, BUT NO ONE HAS

34
00:01:07,877 --> 00:01:11,947
DONE MORE TO GO AFTER THE OPIOID

35
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,984
EPIDEMIC, SUING, GOING AFTER

36
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:16,585
$78 MILLION IN DAMAGES FROM THE

37
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:17,987
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES,

38
00:01:17,987 --> 00:01:20,956
RECENTLY WE WENT AFTER THE DEA,

39
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,158
BECAUSE THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

40
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:24,393
AGENCY HAD BEEN BLANKETING THE

41
00:01:24,393 --> 00:01:25,561
STATE, RUBBER-STAMPING THE

42
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:26,595
APPLICATIONS COMING IN, FLOODING

43
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:28,597
WEST VIRGINIA WITH PILLS.

44
00:01:28,597 --> 00:01:29,999
WE WENT AFTER IT AND ARE PUTTING

45
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:31,801
AN END TO THAT.

46
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,602
EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOLS, AND

47
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:34,770
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE GOING AFTER

48
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,905
TREATMENT AS WELL.

49
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:37,907
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

50
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:39,075
PEOPLE'S NEEDS IN THEIR HEADS

51
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:39,975
AND THEIR HEARTS.

52
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,778
I WILL CONCLUDE ON THIS NOTE,

53
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:45,181
ALL OF US INCLUDING ME AND MY

54
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:46,982
FAMILY, WE HAVE SEEN ISSUES WITH

55
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:47,349
ADDICTION.

56
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:49,385
THERE IS NO ONE HERE TONIGHT

57
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:50,986
THAT HAS NOT FELT IT.

58
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,022
AND FOR SOMEONE LIKE EVAN

59
00:01:53,022 --> 00:01:53,823
JENKINS TO KEEP THE POLITICAL

60
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:56,392
DIALOGUE TO SAY THAT THINGS ARE

61
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:58,027
NOT TRUE TO HIDE HIS DEEP

62
00:01:58,027 --> 00:02:00,663
LIBERAL BACKGROUND IS VERY SAD.

63
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,398
>> Bret: MR. MORRISEY I

64
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:03,766
UNDERSTAND, BUT AS

65
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:04,767
ATTORNEY GENERAL YOU DID SEE

66
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:06,202
WITH THE MAJOR PILL DISTRIBUTOR,

67
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:08,471
BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOUR WIFE

68
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:09,972
WAS LOBBYING FOR THAT PILL

69
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,340
DISTRIBUTOR PERIOD IS THAT NOT A

70
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,611
CONFLICT OF INTEREST?

71
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:17,213
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

72
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:18,547
>> WE HAVE HANDLED EVERYTHING

73
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:20,583
EXACTLY RIGHT, I THINK MOST

74
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:21,317
PEOPLE IN THE STATE WOULD SAY

75
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:23,152
THAT WE HAVE A MORE EFFECTIVE

76
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:26,188
TAKING ON THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC

77
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:26,789
THAN ANYONE.

78
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:28,958
I NOTE WHEN I GOT INTO OFFICE

79
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,259
THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE ABUSE

80
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,093
FIGHTING UNIT IN THE STATE.

81
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:32,995
WE HAVE TURNED THINGS AROUND HER

82
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:35,231
TO THE OTHER POINT, YOU CITED

83
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:40,136
IT, THE STATISTICS FROM

84
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:41,537
ON THE WATCH AS GOVERNOR.

85
00:02:41,537 --> 00:00:00,000
HE WAS SLEEPING AT THE SWITCH
