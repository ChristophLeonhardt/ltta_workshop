strategy the greatly misused an overused word go to the business book section of any bookstore and you'll see Sun Tzu's guide to their Sun Tzu's strategic guide to that but what is strategy it's something that we forgotten to do at least for 20 years one of the first things that you need to do if you're really being strategic is to look at the threats around you and to prioritize them you can't do everything at once even if you're America but that's exactly what the president has done he has changed the international system he's threatened old ways of doing business if you look at the amazing advancements achieved just in the last few days with regards to the Korean Peninsula these are game-changing initiatives but it's very easy to forget just what's happened in the meantime and here I'd like to talk about Isis the president came in with a set of priorities number one was to destroy the Islamic state as we said inside the White House the primary task was to decimate and to eventually to destroy the physical Caliphate something which we had been told would take generations by the prior president President Obama but without military unleashed with a new Secretary of Defense and with a commander-in-chief who trusts our military the physical Caliphate was destroyed in Syria and Iraq and let's just remind ourselves because nobody's talking about this right now the mainstream media haven't written with the respect due to this accomplishment about how this has occurred in fact it's as if it's old history just two and a half years ago Isis ran a Caliphate in multiple countries of the Middle East and even North Africa with Boko Haram being of their Caliphate they had according to the National Counterterrorism Center more than 18 nations had fully functioning Isis affiliates in them now thanks to the deployment of US advisors and to the leveraging of our allies in the Middle East the Iraqis the Kurds the and others the Isis Caliphate is no more we are having mop-up operations but more than 90 percent of that former Caliphate territory has been liberated not something you'll hear on CNN tonight or on the front cover of the New York Times quite an accomplishment and the 14th months of this administration but a global reset is occurring read my recent article in the hill for just how wide-ranging this reset is from the aluminium and steel tariffs to NATO to the Paris Accords it is a reset of the international system brought to you by leadership out of the White House Isis has not been defeated at least not the broader global jihadi movement but we have put priorities in place and they are working we need to understand however what Reagan warned us of the loss of Liberty is always what but one generation away in my book defeating jihad I paint the picture of how groups like Isis and al-qaeda are in fact linked to prior totalitarian ideologies like the fascists of World War two the Nazi regime like the Soviet Union of the Cold War they are all dictatorial ideologies that will brook no compromise they will kill you or enslave you unless you defeat them first America can destroy any enemy but you have to prioritize we've done so with Isis now we're going to deal with other threats a nuclearized Iran a rising militant China and other threats but all of them can be defeated because America has done it before America first but not America alone thank you for watching the Gawker briefing if you liked this video please check out the rebel media YouTube channel follow me on Twitter at Seb Gorka that's Seb G oh our K a and share these videos on Facebook and Twitter because with your help we can push back on the fake news industrial complex and finally get the truth out god bless
