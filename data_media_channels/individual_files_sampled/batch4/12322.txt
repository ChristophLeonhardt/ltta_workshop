they're a bunch of lies that are being told right now and we'll go through a lot of the lies that are being told by the media in just a second but some of the lives being told or that Trump is randomly deciding to separate kids at the border he doesn't have to do that he does have to do that by operation of law the only thing the Trump administration is doing differently is they are treating everyone who is crossing the border illegally as an illegal immigrant for prosecution for purposes of prosecution and then because you're doing that the kids can't stay in custody with the parents longer than 20 days and that is operation of law once again now the media are going nuts over all of this and they are they're making a huge fuss out of all of this when they're showing up at the border and they are showing up at these at these particular at these particular border stations where the kids are being held the kids are being held separately in what are cages essentially now when they say cages it makes it sound like the you know it's like a chicken coop like it's tiny it isn't but of course technically the air cage is because its chain-link fence separating people so though the administration has tried to fight back against the cages the cages descriptor saying the kids are being treated pretty well the kids are being treated by some accounts well by some accounts not as well apparently one of the regulations on the books is that federal employees are not allowed to touch the kids for a fear of lawsuit so that means that some of the illegal immigrant children are changing the diapers and a lot of other illegal immigrant children they don't even know the conditions are not good all of this is underfunded Congress could solve all of this by the way the Congress could solve all of this today all they have to do is pass a law that says that if you come into the country illegally with your parents your parents and you get to stay together well you get stay in custody together right that would be the way that you fix this law and then it's the parents option whether they want the kids released to the custody of the HHS or released to the custody of a family member already in the United States but they get to stay with the parents otherwise when Congress can do that tomorrow and Congress should do that today or tomorrow apparently I'm hearing from the speaker's office from speaker Ryan's office that's exactly what speaker Ryan is going to pursue plus funding for expanded facilities to ensure that parents can stay together with their kids when they come across the border so all of this is in the process of getting solved I do find it somewhat suspicious that the media have decided to jump both feet on the bandwagon as though this is some sort of great human rights catastrophe brought on by the Trump administration when of course all of this started under the Obama administration or at least it was happening under the Obama administration Brandon Darby from Breitbart he had a bunch of I remember when I was working a Breitbart cell he put out all these photos hey these are all photos of a bunch of people including children who are at these detention facilities doesn't look that great right me this is from 2014 now you can see all the photos is from 2014 and it's children who are separated from males who are separated from females these facilities are overcrowded right all this was happening in 2015 there's nothing new happening here but the implication is there's something new happening here because it's Trump and that of course is not true
