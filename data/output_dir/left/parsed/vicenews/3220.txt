lazy dogs you want easy money and have a
lot of guns that's a recipe for disaster
this road leads to the loc the line of
control was very hot zone coming to the
real world there's by one team make it
out the front door of the palace looks
like they're trying to bust it down
gotta train for a fight on Saturday this
school Jesus I don't know what
your head after how hard it's gonna go I
feel like it just sends a layer of my
skin off settling
you
