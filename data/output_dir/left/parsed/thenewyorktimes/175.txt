“They keep coming.
Two million illegal immigrants
in California.”
It was 1994 when California’s
Republican governor,
Pete Wilson, ran these ads
during his re-election bid.
“There’s a right way,
and there’s a wrong way.
To reward the wrong way
is not the American way.”
Wilson was plugging
a ballot measure
called Prop 187,
which tried to block
undocumented immigrants from
accessing public services,
like education.
“We need Pete
Wilson as governor.”
In the short term,
Wilson’s messaging worked.
He was re-elected
governor.
But long term, the fallout
from Prop 187 helped turn
a generation of Latinos
in California into Democrats.
Today, the Latino
population in California
is the largest of any state.
And 63% are
registered Democrats.
And now, the president has
given them more reasons
to make their voices heard.
“These are animals.”
“They’re rapists.”
“Like we have no border.”
“Mexico’s paying for the wall.”
Latinos could play a critical role
in some of California’s 
congressional races,
potentially flipping seats
and helping Democrats
regain control of the House.
They could also help elect
California’s first modern-day
Latino governor.
But will they go to the polls?
Latinos make up
34% of California’s
adult population.
But they’re only 18% of the
state’s voting population.
One reason they don’t have the
electoral power you’d expect
could be that politicians
haven’t reached out enough.
Antonio Villaraigosa,
who is running for governor,
is the clearest
example of a candidate
trying to change that.
He’s tapping into
fear and anger
over Trump’s agenda
in a number of ads
in English and Spanish.
In this one, which could be
confused with a
Hollywood movie,
he and a group of activists
leave drinking water
for border crossers.
“I'm the youngest child of a
single immigrant mother.”
Another high profile Latino
candidate, Kevin de León,
also talks about his
own life story as a way
to engage Latino voters.
“I owe it to this single mother.
This woman and millions like her,
throughout the state,
throughout the country,
who would do everything
within their power
to protect their children.”
Gil Cisneros is a
leading candidate
in a heavily Latino
House district
where the Republican
congressman is retiring.
This ad focuses on giving
Latinos the opportunity
to go to college.
It’s too early to tell if
this messaging will work
to awaken what some call 
the “sleeping giant”
of the Latino vote.
But in the lead up to
the November midterms,
we’ll see more outreach
and advertising
directed at Latinos in this
key state for Democrats.
