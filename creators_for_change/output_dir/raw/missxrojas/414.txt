sentimental anyway has made me extremely

21
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,530
sentimental this year because it was it

22
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,360
just shuffled on my playlist the other

like my number one Christmas song<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

25
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,700
now it just makes me really sad so kids

all good things<font color="#E5E5E5"> other good things didn't</font>

27
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,449
win the lottery again but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> occurs to</font>

28
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,129
me that every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I play the lottery</font>

29
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,199
some part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my head assumes that i'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna win that mindset cost effect well</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i know you know i'm not an obsessive</font>

32
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,539
gambler I don't play the lottery often

33
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,010
so the fact that I'm choosing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to play</font>

34
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,719
this time shorting means I'm going to

35
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,790
win also because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm using the</font>

Twitter followers using their biases

38
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,740
rather than my own to pick numbers and

39
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,390
worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that not only do I become</font>

40
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,560
convinced that i'm going to win the

41
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,689
lottery<font color="#CCCCCC"> i then start to spend the money</font>

42
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,700
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my head and pay off my debt to my</font>

44
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,729
think it's genuinely surprised when

45
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">other numbers come up and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't wind</font>

46
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,390
which is stupid which is really stupid

47
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,280
and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially stupid because if</font>

48
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that whole reasoning comes from the fact</font>

49
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,189
that I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a regular lottery player</font>

50
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,229
but I look back at my Twitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

51
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:32,909
that I've played the lottery pretty much

52
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,390
every week for the past two months think

53
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,100
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of makes me a regular lottery</font>

54
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,450
player it does pay off sometimes I have

55
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,040
one two occasions one about<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven pounds</font>

56
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,840
from the lottery I can really understand

57
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,520
now when people<font color="#CCCCCC"> get properly addicted to</font>

58
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,560
gambling because it's there's a part of

59
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,299
your mind that<font color="#CCCCCC"> just thinks what if so</font>

60
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,460
YouTube charted<font color="#E5E5E5"> rihanna's descent into a</font>

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,380
life of gambling addiction next step

62
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,540
online<font color="#CCCCCC"> poker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think was a BBC that</font>

63
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,799
recently interviewed someone on the news

64
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,890
about like their poker living off poker

65
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,659
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really funny seeing all these kind</font>

66
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,219
of news corporation's and magazines and

67
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,930
things trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font>

68
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,460
as a lifestyle I mean they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing</font>

69
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,770
this on and off for years now since like

70
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,360
two thousand seven or whenever it was

71
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,160
that Charlie occurred of BBC News think

72
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,770
I was like the first major kind of news

73
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,020
interest on video blogging I guess but

74
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,640
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get everything wrong they just</font>

75
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,500
don't understand it<font color="#E5E5E5"> they always try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

76
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,120
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it more gimmicky than it really is</font>

77
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,370
and it just it's frustrating so the next

78
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,900
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will be doing the next thing</font>

79
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,340
you'll probably see here hopefully if I

80
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,020
get my together it's a kind of

81
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,940
little press pack of what YouTube is and

82
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,980
what logging is I can't really you know

83
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,810
claim to summarize that I'm not like the

84
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,180
master<font color="#CCCCCC"> of YouTube wish the best way of</font>

85
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,470
course for people to find out what

86
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,880
YouTube is is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually spend time</font>

87
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking through the major players and</font>

88
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,710
the minor players and trying maybe

89
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,120
trying out for themselves rather than

90
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,490
just doing generic crap that everyone

91
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,600
does it's just frustrating because

92
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,950
people make so many mistakes when

93
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,570
they're reporting it's just crap so it's

94
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,730
crap I think crap is my word of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

95
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,310
cuz I'm feeling I feel quite crap really

96
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I just can't many motivate myself</font>

97
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,220
to do my work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very unusual</font>

98
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,110
for me I normally really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get adrenaline</font>

99
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,790
from work today that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the case</font>
