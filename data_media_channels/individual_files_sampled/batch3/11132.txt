well welcome to Sophie & Co I'm Sophie Shevardnadze Israeli Air Force's strikes inside Syria are growing bolder targeting Iranian military installations in the country well Israeli actions provoked an all-out conflict in the Middle East well my guest today is Lieutenant General Benjamin GATS xx chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Force the Syrian civil war keeps throwing in new players with Israeli Jets in Syrian airspace striking government military targets as well as Damascus Iranian allies the risk of a serious response from Tehran is growing while Israel continued gambling with its strikes in the face of possible confrontation in Syria is it ready for any possible escalation and can the Middle East to get another conflict Lieutenant General Benjamin Ganz a 20th IDF chief-of-staff welcome to the show it's really great to have you with us lots to talk about Russia is planning to deliver s-300 missile defense systems to Syria following the u.s. coalition and Israeli strikes earlier this month Israel has always criticized the prospect of Damascus having asked three hundreds but as 300 system are in essence defense weapon why do they make Israel so nervous well definitely the 300 system is a serious system that covers lots of area to include the airspace of Israel and once there in the end of the Syrians and not in the control of Russia it may end up using it the way think it is Israel is operating in the northern arena not against Russia of course no even against Syria itself but it's actually acting against what we believe to be negative elements of strategic capabilities within the hands of the wrong people and this system if it's there might challenge us a little bit but I believe we know how to deal with everything former head of Israel's military intelligence almost yablon thinks israeli air force is likely to strike the s-300s if those are deployed in syria since they view the missile system as a threat do you think it's a likely scenario well you know I cannot put myself in the hand in the heads or in the shoes as we say or formal acting generals and Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence I'm sure and I'm confident that our strategic leadership is not trying to operate against Russia of course all it needs to do all it wants to do is to ensure Israel's security and I have full confidence in their discussion and their the way they think things being done so we let the future speak but general I mean things happen every day unexpected things happen every day so if that was a scenario that hypothetically would take place with that sat Moscow and Tel Aviv on a dangerous path of confrontation is Israel ready for that and taken that both have enjoyed really good relations recently yeah definitely I think the relations between Russia and Israel are both good and definitely important one and I don't see a collision between Israel in Russia is such once again Sophie Israel's interests in the Nolan arena of pure security interest in many ways we are if you wish warrior by default not because we want to but because we have to so I'm sure that if there is a way to bypass the need of confrontation people will definitely like it however we cannot jeopardize our security interests and whatever comes under those consideration comes under this consideration Israel's defense minister Lieberman said that the Israeli retaliation will come if and I quote anyone attacks us that the country will strike whatever system it needs to so far it's Israel doing the attacking in Syria so if it stops doing that and risking a counter strike it should be worried about anything should it yeah well you see that the point is very much so everybody is trying to promote stability in the northern arena Russia is trying to promote it Israel definitely support stability in the northern arena so we have this strategic trend of political stability that but respect but underneath this canopy of stability if you wish we can see the positioning and the potential rise of radical elements with strategic capabilities in their hands this is something Israel cannot stuck its head in the sand and say it's nothing if somebody spitting in do it doesn't mean that it's raining out and so we have to look into realities eyes if you wish and really to operate against what we believe that seriously endanger our security in the region and therefore I think that's what Minister of Defense Lieberman avrech he said that we will have to operate against whatever we will have to operate if it endanger us what exactly do you mean by dangerous elements because you've said Israel is after stability in the north and arena but striking Syrian targets or Iranian targets in Syria it doesn't really bring stability at all how does that work so so so Iranians who operates from Syria or from Lebanon against Israel it's a radical outpost that doesn't just look to stabilize Syria but it like to build capabilities against Israel and when those capabilities becomes potentially danger this is something very serious that we have to take in our consideration and I believe that our leadership is doing just that so since 2012 Israelis believed to launch more than hundred airstrikes on Syrian territory aiming at suspected Iranian linked targets like you've said is this the reason for Israel's opposition to as three hundreds in Syria I mean they're reinforcing of Syrian missile defense shield won't allow Israel to do what they did before on a regular basis yeah well I'm sure that within the official channels between Ministry of Defense Prime Minister and President Putin who I respect very much trying to put this stability on ground the discussions are being made over there and once again I think we should not ignore the real facts under the surface stability it's on the upper layer underneath there are negative elements being pushed Hizballah is the biggest terrorist organization operating from the northern arena it is being supported by Syria it is being supported by the Iranians it is being equipped with high technologies which will endanger this world security we cannot ignore that and therefore we are very clear on what we are saying and definitely clear with what we are doing this is exactly what you are saying nobody is seeking for Syrian society nobody is seeking for Syrian territory nobody is seeking for Lebanese Tories you are talking now to the man who was the last one to leave Lebanon in May 2000 you are talking to the men who order to build their field hospital that already treated more than 4,000 Syrians in our Israeli hospitals so Israel has nothing against those countries the only thing we care for this is what we are doing exactly what we are doing we are defending ourselves on the day to day basis and we must be responsible enough strategically speaking looking into potential future threat for us this is exactly what we are doing I understand the logic although friends and allies I understand the logic behind what you're saying and I understand your devotion to the cause that you've been fighting all your life but as of today Hezbollah and the Iranian targets that you call dangerous are fighting the Syrian civil war they're not fighting Israel yeah let's not get too naive Sophy missiles and rockets are being delivered to the Iranians with a higher level of distance with higher level of accuracy with high level of explosions and none of them has been used against is against Syria and I'm glad they didn't use it I'm just saying that they're building pileups of ammunition it has no other address than future israel's target we cannot ignore that fact and this is exactly what we are doing and I am sure that if you would close the camera and speak to whoever you want official intelligence element in Russia or in other places you will get pretty much the same answer well I'll tell you what everyone else is worried about the escalating strikes against Iranian targets in Syria really making people nervous can it direct Iran Israel a confrontation breakout because of this I'm just saying I mean there is a solution for that if you run doesn't push in its strategic capabilities that we know what are they the end target of them that would make things different if your answer is not involved in sir if it's not position with strategic capabilities in Syria if the Revolutionary Guard who operates them will not aim themself to Israel then I see no problem but the reality is that they are saying doing something else and even if we go back to the declaration of the Iranians unfortunately they do talk about destroying Israel etc etc so once we see all that around there's no way we can ignore it or should we ignore it so once again almost yelling and I keep quoting because I just spoke to him recently he thinks that Russia could play a mediating role between Israel and Iran to prevent an all-out conflict Moscow enjoys a good relationship with both sides well Israel accept Russia's help in preventing a big conflict I respect Russia's strategic activity in Syria in trying to stabilize the area once again I don't think we should sacrifice future threat for that stability I think it can come together push for stability push for human rights ensure everybody's interests make sure that no negative element let's put this the codename in our discussion are being put on the ground I think that might change picture alright general we're gonna take a short break right now when we're back we will continue talking with Lieutenant General Benjamin Katz xx IDF chief-of-staff talking about the Middle East pressing issues stay with us and we're back with Lieutenant General Benjamin GATS the 20s IDF chief-of-staff discussing Israel's view on the Middle Eastern affair so general a confrontation with Iran means a confrontation with Hezbollah and the last time it happened it didn't go very smoothly for his life and it's another costly war like that really worth the risk for the country well definitely an escalation in the northern area by and large and in Lebanon specifically will not be a hike in the park as we say but I and I hate to see it's happening obviously from Israeli perspective but seriously speaking since I understand that in Lebanon there are so many houses so many buildings that possess both livingroom and missile room in the same house I would really recommend Lebanon not to let this happen because I think the price that Lebanon will end up paying an unfortunate price I must say would be by far higher than what will be on the Israeli side we know it's not easy but we are capable of dealing with whatever threat that comes from the north the Iran deal is once again in jeopardy as to trump administration is weighing in new sanctions it's in jeopardy because once again the Trump administration is weighing in new sanctions against it on by mid-may Tehran threatens to vigorously resume the nuclear program if United States scraps the deal I know that Israel didn't like the deal since the very beginning but would it be happy if the deal collapsed altogether well I think that what we must bear in mind is the goal of their deal as it was and the idea was to keep away the Iranians from approaching the ability to create potentially military nuclear capability I think all the discussions of what used to be the deal or what might be there be the agreement for future times we'll have to look at it does it serve the goal of keeping the Iranians away or from this ability it's something that the Americans need to put their way they think about it other people are understood there already said that they are supporting the deal but this is something that those countries will have to deal with but I mean it's obvious that if the deal collapses the Tehran will renew uranium enrichment it makes no secret of it it says it will and then Israel will then have to strike an Iranian nuclear side how's that good for anyone I mean there will be retaliation strikes from Iran then the Americans will still be in the region yeah that's why I've said I think that the main strategic goal of everyone should be keep Iran away from nuclear capabilities now the means could be so many so different and so many of them the goal should be one keep them away from being able to produce military nuclear capabilities it's not and Israeli interests it's a wall interest it's the region interest and yes it's an Israeli interest as well if you would speak to someone from the Arab countries in the Gulf area in other places I guess that you would of here simply the same answer so the deal does precisely that it keeps Tehran from enriching uranium does that mean that Israel is in favor of the deal well the Prime Minister of Israel have said so many times and he's been doing it in his discussion with world leader what the gaps that he sees in that deal and can it be improved to make sure that really at the end of the road as Iran does not get the future with permission to produce this nuclear capability I think that's that's the idea I think there are few holes over there and of course all the inspections everything and everything are very important so another topic that's been discussed very much lately the grand delegation is prepared by President Trump to go to Israel to mark the transfer of the embassy to Jerusalem seeing how his announcement of the transfer really made the Palestinian issue heat up do you see this as a maybe a little over-the-top and unnecessary maybe even a provocative move well you know I don't look at they're really they're provocative potentially I the reason of it of the potential escalation of it definitely you know Jerusalem is the capital of Israel you've been in Israel so many times you know it yourself since the day of King David we didn't need to have president Trump resort to respect with saying it but it's Jerusalem is our capital it's my opinion that most countries all countries should basically move their assets into Jerusalem just like the case in Moscow just like the case in Washington DC even though that New York City is the let's put it with a financial capital which of United States you've been to Tel Aviv Tel Aviv is a definitely a financial capital of the state of Israel but the capital of Israel is Jerusalem and that's where all those embassies need to be and sometimes it's out together but that part of life yeah but I mean so far it's just the Americans red carpeting the Jerusalem embassy others aren't too prone and too quick to accept that really I hope and believe that more countries will follow them it needs to do nothing with the Palestinian in just another excuse for not doing anything well I tell you how it looks from the outside because with so many politicians coming over to Israel it seems that this is not just about the Israelis it's more about the American voters and I mean it's great for Trump to portray himself as a friend of Israel to his voters at home but should he really be doing it at the expense of Israel's security again we believe that Jerusalem is our capital for decades hundreds years thousands years and in police state so for future times as well is well without Jerusalem is not Israel as we understand it according to our Jewish history and the Israeli history of our country sometimes those principle come with price I don't think it should come with price I think it has to do nothing with the Palestinian issue all those places are talking about Jerusalem as we know it and the locations are such that there is no really interaction and definitely interfere with nothing of the Palestinians idea so if seriously we would like to put politics aside for a second and we look at the essence itself I'd see I don't see why should there be any major problems but once again Jerusalem is essential for us and we will stand for it forever so general you know most of the time I want to talk to the Israelis about the Palestinian issue they tell me that the Palestinians do not want peace that Israel is ready for concessions but Palestinians aren't and you can't talk to them and then when I talk to the Palestinians they say the exactly same thing about Israel though you you are obviously a very patriotic man who served and served his country are you able to take a step back and see this from a distance how unbending both sides are I think I think I can Sophie I think that both the Palestinians and the Israelis need to give up and illusionary dreams of getting rid from the other we are staying here they are staying here and eventually we have to find ways of living side-by-side peacefully they already got historical political suggestion by Prime Minister Olmert by prime minister Barak in both cases they rejected them and we face wave of violence Zuri is a result of it we didn't give up on our security and our existence nor should we do it in the future but I really hope that on both sides we would find leaders that will understand that they need to sit with one another nobody's going anywhere and find the ways of living side-by-side peacefully without Israel securing its security and existence and I think that if people are serious enough ways will be found do you think it's wise to be so stern on the Palestinian issue I tell you I'm asking because this is something that hits me personally me very closely you shoot at people at Gaza border and then a man wearing a kippah is attacked in broad daylight in Berlin and in France where I grew up and most of my childhood friends friends are French Jewish people and it's getting dangerous for the Jews does and it's so interrelated don't tell me it's not related there's being tough on the Palestinians in danger the Jewish communities in Europe well unfortunately we might see negative linkage between things that happens here and think that might happen under the wave of anti-semitism in different places in the world just like the examples that you have given and once again let's be honest enough to say what we are seeing in Gaza those are unfortunate event instead of Hamas supporting its people and taking its budget and building them and an education system water electricity whatever they take them and use them as zoom shields in the front of the border trying to penetrate time through damage the infrastructure over there this is something that obviously we cannot allow and unfortunately just saying that we are not agreeing is not enough we have to sometimes do things and those unfortunate event will continue to happen as long as Hamas doesn't stop them on their side so do you think the current lineup of states that are mediating the conflict working out well I mean the United States is Israel's biggest ally but as a mediator it might not be the best since the Palestinians don't trust the white house do you think a change of format might help move this issue along well the way I see it it's an israeli-palestinian challenge it should be an Israel Palestinian issue with the support whoever decides to give this support and I really think that for the benefit of the future the future of the Palestinian kids that were born yesterday or today or will be born tomorrow and same stance for my kids or other kids in Israel it's both sides leadership need to sit down try to solve it with the help of the others but the others cannot solve it for us general thank you very much for this very candid take on the issues that we've discussed we were talking to Lieutenant General Benjamin guns xx IDF chief-of-staff discussing Israeli view on the situation in Syria and other pressing issues of the Middle East that's it for this edition of Sophie and Coe I will see you next time
