98
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,710
got to show you this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really cool just</font>

99
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,690
I say I'm a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> disappointed in the</font>

100
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,640
quality of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bracelet I thought it was</font>

101
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,950
going to be a lot bigger and more fit to

102
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,650
my wrist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those like</font>

103
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,410
class that you can't even like put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

104
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,240
yourself so right now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really loose</font>

105
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,040
I can't tighten it because I can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

106
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,930
with one hand so someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

107
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,000
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on for you but i'll just show you the</font>

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,140
bracelet this is it here so it looked

109
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,180
way cooler online it was like more

110
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,009
tighter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

111
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,189
so it looks weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it doesn't fit</font>

112
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:47,990
obviously because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got those that</font>

113
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,830
class thing so it's super hard to put on

114
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,229
anyways the reason why I got it is

115
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,439
because i really like i really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what</font>

116
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,399
it stands for so if you can see there's

117
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,169
an anchor like an affinity symbol and

118
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:07,849
like a steering wheel<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's like a</font>

119
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:09,830
sailor one but i really like it because

120
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,779
first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> navy</font>

121
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,279
bracelets to where it was a lot of

122
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,839
naming I wear a lot of Navy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

123
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,330
like it but i like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because jesus is</font>

124
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,189
my anchor his love<font color="#CCCCCC"> is eternal and he is</font>
