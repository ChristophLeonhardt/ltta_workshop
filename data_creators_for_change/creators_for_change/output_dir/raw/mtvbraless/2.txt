1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:03,278
- When you see two guys
holding hands what do you think

2
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:04,149
is going on?

3
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:06,419
Your answer will not surprise me

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:08,680
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,528
look there a lot of reasons
not to hold hands maybe

6
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:13,259
you have a cold maybe your
palms are sweaty maybe

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,878
your fingers are coated
in a slimy layer of Cheeto

8
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:17,718
dust that you tired licking
off but then turned into an

9
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:21,259
orange paste stuck under your
nails but then there are a

10
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:23,589
few totally bogus reasons
that have straightes dudes

11
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:26,160
freaked out ever where at the
idea of physical contact with

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,299
another man so we won't call
it mans-explaining but I have

13
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:31,920
found the perfect straightes
dude to help explain

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,039
hey there Kenny touched any dudes lately?

15
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,219
- So many Franchesca some
how I'm still straight

16
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,291
look showing affection
friendship of familiarity through

17
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,069
touch is perfectly normal
and it's actually instinctive

18
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:46,080
one of our first impulses as
dumb little babies is to hold

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,641
stuff it's so instinctive
there's actually a name for it

20
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:53,249
it's the Palmer Grasp Reflex
it's a reaction in human babies

21
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:56,639
and many other mammals prompting
them to grab an object like

22
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,672
a finger in response to its
touch that's right even in a

23
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:02,713
state where our skulls are
mushy and we're liable to crap

24
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:07,180
ourselves we still understand
that touch is natural and it

25
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,671
isn't always romantic you
know but at some point middle

26
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:14,004
school non sexual touch
between men gets stigmatized

27
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:15,287
and a lot of it comes down
to the absurd social norms we

28
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:20,045
impose on young men called
toxic masculinity and no toxic

29
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,571
masculinity is not a new energy drink

30
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:24,589
- But before we go any further
let's just point out that

31
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:27,771
toxic masculinity doesn't
mean that men are inherently

32
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:30,989
bad or toxic it's the idea
that the cultural expectation

33
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:33,629
and restrictions on what
constitute masculinity or a

34
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:36,549
real man can be extremely damaging

35
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:40,059
- Toxic masculinity because
holding back your emotions

36
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,762
required energy

37
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:44,621
well not every man buys into
these cultural expectation

38
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:47,462
almost every man in this country
has been affected by them

39
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:49,672
when was the last time you just
went up to your boy and you

40
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:53,034
were like yo lets hold hands
mother (bleep) and he was like

41
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:56,909
hell yeah my dude and what's
funny is that our reluctance to

42
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,958
hold hands is because it's gay
or feminine and that assumes

43
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:03,242
that there is something wrong
with men being gay or feminine

44
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:04,322
there's not

45
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:07,941
- The idea that straight men
holding hands is inherently gay

46
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,722
reached a fever pitch not so
long ago during the height of

47
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:13,813
a boy band you might of
heard of called One Direction

48
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:16,733
two of the bands members Louie
Tomlinson and Harry Styles

49
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:19,154
were known for their close
friendship they were frequently

50
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:22,274
photographed hugging, holding
hands, and even kissing fans

51
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:24,714
obsessed over their connection
to the point where a rumor

52
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:28,034
started that the two might
be in a romantic relationship

53
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:30,703
the thing is despite the
massive amount of shipping fan

54
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:33,263
faction that I'm sure was
probably written they were not

55
00:02:33,263 --> 00:02:36,762
romantically connected they
both said so so many times

56
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:40,434
the things is fans wouldn't
let up they even created a name

57
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:44,954
for the supposedly gay couple
Larry really that's it that is

58
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:49,314
so basic the band has since
broken up but in 2017 Louie

59
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:52,114
Tomlinson confirmed that his
friendship with Styles was

60
00:02:52,114 --> 00:02:55,402
changed by fans insistence
that their friendly affection

61
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:58,253
made them gay he told Seventeen
magazine it created this

62
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:01,023
atmosphere between the two of
us where everyone was looking

63
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:04,194
into everything we did. It
made everything a little bit

64
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:06,874
more unapproachable and I
don't believe I'm going to say

65
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:09,131
this but how dare you
do that to One Direction

66
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:10,714
Directioners don't come for me

67
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:12,983
- What might seem like an
insensitive homophobic joke

68
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:17,662
that's so gay or you guys
are so gay for each other is

69
00:03:17,662 --> 00:03:20,612
actually an insidious way of
policing masculinity a study

70
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:23,162
with over 19 thousand
participants at the University of

71
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,722
Indiana showed that men who
adhere to hyper masculine norms

72
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:29,002
such as the objectification
of women, self reliance, and

73
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:31,922
repressing emotional expression
typically suffer from mental

74
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:34,474
health issues and these include
depression, and increased

75
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:37,234
suicidal thoughts and that
study doesn't even mention the

76
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:40,542
poor guys that are bullied
for not being hyper masculine

77
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:44,063
so lets be clear whether you
adhere or not toxic masculinity

78
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:49,063
helps no one and makes us all
sad and want to kill ourselves

79
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:52,474
call me a radical but maybe
we should get rid of it

80
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:55,383
and this fear of holding hands
is also pretty exclusively a

81
00:03:55,383 --> 00:03:56,373
western phenomenon

82
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:59,042
- Samir Khalaf a sociology
professor in Lebanon told the

83
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:02,582
New York Times back in 2005
that holding hands is the

84
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:05,822
warmest expression of affection
between men in Arab culture

85
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:08,802
it's a sign of solidarity and
kinship the same can be said

86
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:11,522
for men in Latin American
countries that often greet each

87
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:14,173
other with a hug or kiss on
the cheek or in India where

88
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:16,952
men are often seen walking
down the street holding hands

89
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:20,642
or even in Uganda where men
demonstrating platonic physical

90
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:23,772
affection is normal despite
being a country with some of the

91
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:27,942
harshest anti LGBT laws in
the African continent America

92
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:31,154
land of the free except not
really free for a man to hold

93
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:32,781
another mans hand

94
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:35,541
- It's just this guys it's all
it is we're not really asking

95
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,383
you to touch wieners here unless
you want to which of course

96
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:41,932
is cool besides holding hands
feels good it actually prompts

97
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:44,602
your body to generate
oxytocin a neural transmitter

98
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:48,192
associated with feelings of
trust and generosity aka things

99
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:51,693
that make you happy so if we
know touch is good and strict

100
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:54,342
masculine social norms are
bad what should us guys do to

101
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:55,234
change it?

102
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:58,242
Well here's some stuff start
paying attention to when people

103
00:04:58,242 --> 00:05:01,280
are forcing their own
ideas of gender onto you

104
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,303
reject that watch out for
things like gendered colors,

105
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:05,136
gendered toys, gendered sports,
gendered careers, because

106
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:09,942
all these things do is create
very narrow spaces for people

107
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,583
to explore and be themselves

108
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,213
- In other words pink is just
a color if you think it looks

109
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,253
good on you go for it

110
00:05:16,253 --> 00:05:18,103
and this kind of thinking is
extra important if you're a

111
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:21,354
parent but if all of this sounds
like a lot of work there is

112
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,943
one little thing you can
do the smallest of gestures

113
00:05:24,943 --> 00:05:28,933
- Find another guys and
hold his (bleep) hand

114
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:32,492
it'll probably be weird at
first okay but I promise

115
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:34,533
if you're attracted to women
holding another dudes hand

116
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,983
is not going to change that
and after you get over breaking

117
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:39,714
a social taboo it'll actually
feel nice it might even make

118
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,541
healthier and if that's too
much I get it you might want to

119
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:47,023
build up to it alright maybe
start out with one of those bro

120
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:49,465
dude arm around the shoulder
things you know maybe try

121
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:52,495
giving your bro a hug without
having to slap the feminine

122
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:55,695
energy out of him so hard that
you leave marks on his back

123
00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:58,520
maybe even just give a fist
pound if you're a started and

124
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,595
just hold it there for a
minute let your knuckles really

125
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:04,305
absorb each others oxytocin
what ever you gotta do alright

126
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:05,557
back to you Franchesca

127
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:08,045
- Thanks Kenny now that we've
squashed some homophobic

128
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:10,995
ideas about intimacy and
shown just how much toxic

129
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,161
masculinity can deprive us
of literally life saving

130
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:17,211
interactions the rest is up
to you finding little ways to

131
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,969
affirm and support each other
doesn't make a guy any less

132
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:22,743
manly but it could make you
and the people you love a lot

133
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:25,501
happier thanks for watching
and thanks again to Kenny

134
00:06:25,501 --> 00:00:00,000
Deforst and we'll see you next
time right here on Decoded.
