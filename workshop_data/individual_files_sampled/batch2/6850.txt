joining us now on The Young Turks senator Bernie Sanders he introduced the stop Bezos act and today it appears he did Bezos and Amazon announcing that they are going to go to a 15 hour minimum wage senator Sanders welcome the program great to be with you thing and and so let's talk about the stop Bezos act because it seems that work today which is wonderful news for progressives and for workers across the country so what was the intent of the bill and then we'll talk about the results the intent of the bill was pretty simple I think people all over this country are sick and tired of having to subsidize the wealthiest person in the world Bezos is worth about a hundred and fifty five billion his wealth increases by 250 million every single day and yet because he was paying his workers wages that was so low many of those workers were forced to go on food stamps Medicaid was subsidized housing so it made no sense to me and I think the average American to say why do we have to pay taxes in order to subsidize the low wages that the wealthiest guy in the world is paying that's the case we made we worked with hundreds of Amazon workers all across this country check you will remember that Young Turks was a co-sponsor of a very widely viewed a town meeting we did on income and wealth inequality which featured among others a worker from Amazon and a worker from Disneyland and I think as a result of those meetings and a lot of work done at the grassroots level guess what's happened Amazon today said $15 an hour minimum wage Disney a month or so ago negotiated a contract with its unions $15 an hour minimum wage so we're making some progress ya know ladies and gentlemen we autumn the that's huge progress and it actually has even more reverberating consequences which I'll get to in a second but senator Sanders I remember covering that Town Hall I remember you giving the stat you just gave about how much Bezos pricks makes per day and I remember commenting on it live going wow I'm that seems like an awfully high number I got to double-check that it so I fact checked you live and it turns out you were right it does make an astounding amount of money per day he really does so now I want to give you the reaction that others had first of all of course a lot of people on television didn't want to cover that Town Hall but it got the effect that I think you were looking for and it was powerful to see those workers explaining the conditions they have to work on but unfortunately it didn't break through to a lot of the press we found about half a dozen articles and op-eds deriding the act that you had pushed forward with ROH Khanna in the house I'll just quote one of them Bloomberg said it was grandstanding that it was a marketing stunt and that Sanders and his allies either haven't thought through the economics of their bill or more likely don't really care on a day like today when it seems to have worked how do you answer those folks in the mainstream press they were shocked that we introduced legislation that was not going to be passed immediately by right-wing Republicans in the house right-wing Republicans in the Senate and an extreme right-wing gar in the White House what we attempted to do and working with Roe Cano has done a great job in this was to raise consciousness on decision so that all over this country you got working people working really hard and they are asking themselves why is it though I have to pay more in taxes to provide food stamps but somebody's working for the wealthiest guy in the world and I think we did raise consciousness on that and we worked with Amazon workers who helped us on that there was a guy you may recall shank on that town meeting his name was Seth King he worked at Amazon and he did a video with us which ended up having over 10 million viewers and I think what happened today was the Bezos I looked around him and Bezos is nobody's fool he's a smart guy and he understood they're all over this country people were asking hard questions of Amazon and he concluded that doing the right thing paying his workers a decent wage was the smart thing for Amazon and I applaud him for doing that so in fact let me call Bezos he said today we listen to our critics which sounds like you thought hard about what we wanted to do and decided we wanted to lead so let me pause there before you give the second half of that quote is that gratifying to see absolutely you're sure we'll recall what we said during that literally during that hearing and in other moments Bezos who is you know the head of what first the second largest corporation in this country if he leads I have zero doubt that other corporations will follow and right now we are beginning to turn our attention to some of the other companies by the way that we're at that town meeting McDonald's and the whole fast-food industry American Airlines in the end the airline industry our retail companies in general pay notoriously low wages so the point now is that if Bezos and Amazon can pay 15 bucks an hour every major profitable corporation in this country should be able to do the same and we're gonna do our best to make that happen you know at the end of the day Jake when you look about economics in America what I think most people see is that the rich are becoming very very much richer but you got tens of millions of families who continue to struggle despite low unemployment to take care of their basic needs and our job is to raise wages for those workers and I think what Amazon did today is a shot across the bow and it's gonna wake up a lot of other corporations we're gonna try to do the same yeah and change starts as a ripple and then one day becomes a wave and then hopefully a tsunami and that leaves me the second part of the quote Bezos also said we're excited about this change it encouraged our competitors and other larger employers to join us and I think that I don't know that that this was the intent but although you just talked about and it sounds like it partly was once they decided that they're going to up their wages it not only is the right thing to do to encourage their competitors to likewise but it actually gives them a financial incentive to push other employers to raise their wages absolutely they will be in a competitive disadvantage if they're paying 15 bucks an hour and competitors are paying 12 or 13 bucks an hour so it is in their financial advantage to raise the minimum wage and you know as you know a last year we introduced legislation for $15 an hour we got 30 co-sponsors in the Senate and we look forward to working with Amazon to see that that legislation or something similar to it is in fact passed but bottom line is that Amazon has gone first and we expect and we'll do our best to make sure that Walmart Target McDonald's the airline industry follows no I you know unlike the mainstream press I haven't think that the plan is near genius and I'll tell you why it's not just to be effusive in the praise in hindsight and I sent it ahead of time the minute that you and roe Connor releases is because it takes potential opponents like Amazon and once they agree to it and turns them into allies really powerful allies to push for $15 minimum wage across the country and I mean I think already with the Amazon and Disney workers alone I would argue given that Trump has not done anything for the average American worker that you've already affected more change in his administration than he has what do you think about that well I mean I think it's true you know and I know and I think a majority of the American people know that Trump is a phony and a liar he campaigned on supporting the needs of working people and not only did he try to throw thirty two million of them off of health care and give huge tax breaks to the very very rich but he has done nothing not said one word about the need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage so I think with Disney with Amazon working with people by the way a lot of credit has got to go to the folks that fight for 15 you know they saw years ago with an idea that everybody thought was crazy how can you talk about doubling the federal minimum wage and then some they kept at it at the fast-food industry we're seeing states and cities moving poet and by the way I think that Bezos action today will make it easier for state legislatures and cities all over the country to raise their own minimum wage not to mention giving more some more backbone but to members of Congress let's support a $15 an hour minimum wage yeah I absolutely think it's a sea change and and I think this is exactly what unity looks like when progresses work together outside groups Senators Congressmen etc to fight for a unified position and and look I was frustrated with President Obama that he didn't use the bully pulpit enough and this is what an effective use of the bully pulpit looks like but I want to end on this question Dave Clark is a senior vice president in charge of operations for Amazon and he released the video today where the workers of Amazon were absolutely jubilant and they cheered wildly when this announcement was made that their wages were wages were gonna go up it was gonna affect their lives positively and he had said this was the best all-hands ever as an all-hands meeting at the company how much joy does that give you to see those workers that excited about improvement in their lives whichever we saw that video we soared and if you could see the spontaneous reaction of the workers and one second and so as they heard that she is and jumping up and down you know sometimes we forget I know you don't and Young Turks does not but the corporate media does how many people are struggling so you say to some executive is some upper middle class person $15 an hour who cares they're not worried about $15 either they're making a lot more than that we forget how many people this week are struggling to put food on the table and you could see in the faces of those Amazon workers what it means that they're gonna get a 20 or 30 percent wage increase that maybe they can be able to buy the kind of Christmas gifts with their kids that they want it's a big deal so we're off to a great start and I want to thank Young Turks you have been with us from the sod honest let's keep going together and the goal here not a radical idea is that if you work 40 hours a week in this country you should not be living in poverty when making progress let's keep going all right thank
