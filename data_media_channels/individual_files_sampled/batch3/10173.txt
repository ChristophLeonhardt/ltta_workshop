it's ten days and Counting until football's biggest event kicks off in Russia we caught up with Brazilian double World Cup winner calf ooh and he's been giving us some insight into how his former team might perform at this year's tournament expectations are really high not only concerning the World Cup in Russia but also concerning the World Cup in general especially regarding the Brazilian team pressure is high you are fighting for a World Cup with the Brazilian team there are more than 220 million Brazilians that's 220 million football coaches 220 million football fans so there's additional pressure on players to have a great World Cup when we come to World Cup we come to win no one plays at a World Cup just to say this late we come to win of course sometimes it doesn't happen the way he wanted to but you can be sure that the won't be and the lack of commitment and Brazil is going to have a great World Cup
