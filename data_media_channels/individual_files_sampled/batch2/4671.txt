michael cohen is changing lawyers and rupert murdoch is trying to get President Trump to change lawyers or to at least get rid of Rudy Giuliani Rupert Murdoch obviously sees Rudy Giuliani is not helping to protect Rupert Murdoch's investment in the White House and so Rupert Murdoch's New York Post today we ran a two-page spread about Rudy Giuliani's most recent escapade of marital infidelity as described by Rudy Giuliani's most recent wife Rupert Murdoch's New York Post included surveillance pictures of Rudy Giuliani's new alleged mistress but if rupert murdoch really wants to protect his investment in the White House he might have to consider paying for Michael Cohen's new lawyers because Michael Cohen clearly cannot afford to be paying hundreds of thousands of dollars a week to defend himself in a federal investigation in New York City and continue his civil case against stormy Daniels to try to enforce the non-disclosure agreement that he wrote that was designed to prevent stormy Daniels from telling her story about having sex with Donald Trump the story which she told but Michael Cohen of course forgot to get his client Donald Trump to sign that agreement and so stormy Daniels new lawyer Michael avenatti is fighting Michael Cohen and Donald Trump in court in California but tonight Michael avenatti is here in New York and Michael avenatti joins our discussion now I want you did a calculation about how much the this case is costing Michael Cohen in New York City that you put out today you estimated it could be a half a million dollars a week correct 15 lawyers some of them getting over 1500 hours some of them as a low would be seven hundred an hour correct and under New York rates I mean I think you're looking at 15 lawyers at about 50 hours a week and you do the math and it's you know on average a hybrid rate of 700 750 an hour and that's before you factor in mr. Ryan who's probably billing at about 1200 an hour I mean the burn rate Lawrence here is significant it's it's by about a half a million dollars a week and look this is no different than than many other criminal white-collar prosecutions you know you have a defendant that starts off defiant like mr. Cohen who talks about he's willing to take a bullet for his co-conspirator and all of a sudden the burn rate sets in and you realize you're burning through your cash and you're never gonna get that money back that money's gonna be gone forever and you put on an island by your co-conspirators which is what has happened to him with this president with with mr. Trump they put this guy in an island which is beyond stupid okay this is a president that that demands and values loyalty but provides none and we've seen that time and time again and in this case it's gonna ultimately cost him because they're basically putting this guy on an island not to mix metaphors but when the music stops he's not gonna be left with the chair and this is a very very dangerous situation for the president I mean I I said this nine weeks ago over two months ago I said that mr. Cohen was very very dangerous to this president I said he was gonna be indicted I said he was gonna flip on the president and that he posed a bigger threat than the mortgage and because he helping him out financially with these legal fees because he's not smart Lawrence I mean why would the president of all the attorneys in the world all the attorneys in United States why would the president hire a guy like really Giuliani you know dazed and confused Rudy to go out on on the Airways and and spew the nonsense and the sexist comments that he has I mean this guy is a walking disaster I mean every day he speaks our case gets better and people get more and more outraged well yeah Rudy hasn't been speaking lately I think for obvious reasons let's listen to Emily Jane Fox in the last hour with Rachel Maddow as we know Emily Jane Fox has direct contact with Michael Cohen she has the best source about Michael Cohen which is Michael Cohen let's listen to what she told Rachel about how Michael Cohen is feeling the president has done nothing in order to to make Michael Cohen feel like he has Michael Collins back and that has been a problem you forget that the president went on Fox News and basically said I barely know the guy he's like a coffee boy he did a very very small percentage of my legal work and then his attorney Rudy Giuliani has gone on television repeatedly making this harder for Michael Cohen and the real action from Michael Cohen from everything I know from my reporting has been these guys don't have my back now a man who is frustrated isolated feeling alone and feeling very very angry at the Trump family in general and at the president angry at the Trump family in general and the president and he has information about the Trump family and the present well Lawrence I think what's going to happen is look nothing lasts forever okay I know a lot of people think that things last forever that they don't last forever and so what's going to happen here is the narcissism of this president you know his arrogance his stupidity is ultimately gonna catch up to him because he's not covering he's not providing air cover for the guy that knows where all the bodies are buried I'm been saying this for a while I mean this is the guy that that handled all of the nonsense for the president for a better part of 12 years okay if there's one guy on the face of the planet that you provide air cover for that you provide legal fees for that you bring in the tent that you make him feel loved and welcomed it's this guy okay but that's not what we've seen in fact we've seen just the opposite and this arrogance in this narcissism is very very dangerous okay this it this is the guy that knows where the bodies are buried and I believe that he's going to sing like a canary because he's not gonna have any choice but to try to save his family and the people that he care about that he cares about and he's gonna be out of money let's listen to this very powerful one-word answer that Emily Jane Fox gave to Rachel's the question that laid it all out let's listen if mr. Cohen either based on those feelings or any disease other dynamics we've been up to talking about if he does decide that he's going to cooperate with prosecutors and tell them everything he knows about his interactions with President Trump over the years is that a potential serious risk for the president in terms of the president's own legal liability yes that's got to be the scariest moment that Donald Trump is out on TV this year well I mean Lawrence you know again I've been saying this for two two-and-a-half months I mean I you know I predicted this and people say to me well how did you know how could you predict this how did you know I mean this really isn't that difficult if you have some experience in this game and you've seen other cases this case even though it involves some rather large important figures in public life is no different than many other white-collar prosecutions but what is astounding to me is that we're talking about the president's who promised the American people he was going to surround himself with the best of the brightest and this guy has surrounded himself you're in a year out with morons people that are completely incompetent and certainly not up to the task at hand and it's gonna come back and it's gonna bite him in a very big way part of Emily Jane fox reporting today is that today today Michael Cohen was engaged with his California lawyers who are fighting you and stormy Daniels over that civil case why doesn't Michael Cohen just drop that case well at this point Lawrence because we put him in a box he doesn't have the ability to drop that case you know that that ship sailed many many weeks ago and it was a it was a trap a tripwire that we laid and he fell right into it as he's done time and time again in connection with these cases Minoo I have to tell you people ask me Lawrence you know over the last three or four months what has surprised you the most in connection with what has happened and the answer is very very clear and that is the incompetence of these lawyers the incompetence of Michael Cohen and the fact that they keep falling into every trap that we lay and again ultimately this is going to prove to be a very very big problem for this project South by the way like Donald Trump has been listening to you because Maggie Haberman New York Times tweeted earlier today and has a story about this tonight saying Trump has been fuming about Cohen in private blaming him for the messy stormy Daniel situation but he also is fearful of make that public because of chances it further pushes Coen toward the Southern District of New York so Donald Trump according to that agrees with you about how messy the stormy Daniels situation is because of Michael Cohen well Lawrence here's the bottom line all the king's horses and all the king's men can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again and it doesn't matter how concerned he is or how much he fumes or how much he yells and screams in the White House he is too far down the path this is not gonna end well for this president I've said it before I'm gonna say it again Michael Evan honey thank you very much for joining us again I think you showed thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC
