1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,583
(smooth music)

2
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:13,736
- Hey everyone, it's me Hallease,

3
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:15,602
endeavoring to preserver as always.

4
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:18,449
Coming at you in San Francisco, California

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,862
from my hotel room; not the
usual setup as you can see.

6
00:00:21,862 --> 00:00:24,299
I am here for the Climate Summit.

7
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:27,138
I'm helping Jouelzy produce
content on her channel,

8
00:00:27,138 --> 00:00:30,473
so I'm on my best videography,
cinematography grind.

9
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:31,809
You know what I'm saying, out here doing

10
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:35,503
your digital storytelling grind, Amen.

11
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,902
I'm just really excited and
grateful for this opportunity.

12
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:40,335
Thank you Jouelzy, you're
the best, love you girl.

13
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:43,040
And we just got back
from Klamath, California

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,906
which is where the Yurok tribe,

15
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:48,586
a Native American tribe
here in the United States,

16
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:51,294
has their territory and
they've partnered with

17
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:55,809
the local California government
to maintain the forests,

18
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:58,941
and so it was really cool
because we got to talk to them

19
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:01,990
and see the areas that
they maintain together.

20
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,876
And also there were a lot of
different indigenous peoples

21
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:07,114
from all over the world that came too,

22
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:12,002
to sort of, kind of like, have
their own sort of mini summit

23
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:14,403
if you will, and talk
about was they can take

24
00:01:14,403 --> 00:01:16,508
what the Yurok Tribe is
doing here in California,

25
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:21,017
and transfer that back to their
own territories and areas.

26
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:23,943
That content will be coming
out on Jouelzy's channel,

27
00:01:23,943 --> 00:01:26,254
and I'm really just
happy to be a part of it,

28
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:29,135
and I'm happy she thought
of me as a collaborator

29
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:31,682
for this project with her, and yeah.

30
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:34,283
I'm just, you know yeah, I'm just happy

31
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:35,512
to be here you know what I mean?

32
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,536
(laughs)

33
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:39,985
Which brings me to my
next point; I hit 13k.

34
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:43,642
I noticed, I think around
last week that I broke 13k,

35
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:45,911
and I don't know why this
feels like a milestone,

36
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:49,287
but it does; it feels
like a milestone to me.

37
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:51,033
For all the people that are subscribed

38
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:53,273
to the channel so far, thank you so much

39
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:56,320
for sticking around and
commenting and sharing and liking.

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,320
I really enjoy reading the comments.

41
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:04,657
Like I make the videos, one,
for myself to catalog my life,

42
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,697
but then also again, to engage with y'all,

43
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:08,997
and to get to know y'all,

44
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:11,632
and have conversations
around different topics,

45
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,499
and tell stories and all
of that so yeah, you know.

46
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:18,467
Please always comment;
I read all the comments.

47
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:20,297
And thank you for the people

48
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:21,676
that have been rolling
with me for a while,

49
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:25,133
I recognize names in the
comments, of people that comment

50
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:27,655
and I know like some of
these names it's like,

51
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:32,112
dang you been rolling with me
since I was like at 5k though.

52
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:34,471
Or since I was like at 2k, you know.

53
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:37,936
So it's really cool to
see how much some of y'all

54
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:41,275
have grown and how, you
know, in correspondence

55
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:44,035
to how I have grown, and it's
just like it's a community.

56
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:46,392
You know, it really is
an engaging community

57
00:02:46,392 --> 00:02:48,546
that I just love being a part of.

58
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:51,348
So yeah, thank you for being here.

59
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:54,015
And if you're new here, welcome.

60
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,184
And so yeah, in celebration of that,

61
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:02,305
there's a sale on the merch.

62
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:04,505
So if you've been following me since

63
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:05,927
the beginning of the year you know

64
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:09,384
that this year my only resolution
was to be a chaotic good,

65
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:12,134
and just try to not focus so much

66
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,145
on all the individual things
and just try to create

67
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,661
for the sake of creating, and you know,

68
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:22,194
just be here there and
everywhere, Amen, you know?

69
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:24,521
Be In the world, but
not of it if you will.

70
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,479
You know what I'm saying,
and I feel like I have

71
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,863
been doing that you know.

72
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:31,215
Every now and then I have
to remind myself though,

73
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:34,217
to not get so bogged down to details

74
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:37,062
and not be so like,
"what's my five year plan,

75
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:38,199
what's my other plan?" you know,

76
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:42,503
and just roll with where God is taking me,

77
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:45,027
you know what I'm saying,
just be open to it.

78
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:47,834
So yeah, in order to keep that in mind,

79
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,797
I decided to work with one
of my favorite designers,

80
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,320
Anastasia, and we together came up with

81
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,320
this design for my resolution
for 2018, be a chaotic good,

82
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:03,124
and I really love the design
and I really love this sweater.

83
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:04,691
I've been wearing it
while I was in Klamath,

84
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:05,907
now we're here in San Francisco

85
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:07,247
and I'm going to be wearing it.

86
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,080
It's so cozy because
it's Bella and Canvas,

87
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,484
so it's like, it's the good
stuff, you know what I mean.

88
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:14,616
But yeah if you're interested
in getting a sweatshirt,

89
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:16,961
I have tee shirts, and I think

90
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:19,076
I also have pillow cases as well.

91
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:20,986
If you're interested
in getting any of that,

92
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:22,928
it's probably actually below this video,

93
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:26,520
but also teespring.com/stores/hallease.

94
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,950
And for the month of September
I have a code launch18,

95
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,689
where you can get 15% off your purchase,

96
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,315
and it's only through
the month of September,

97
00:04:35,315 --> 00:04:38,673
and then it will be back to regular price.

98
00:04:38,673 --> 00:04:41,617
So if you were like,
waiting to execute on merch,

99
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:43,896
if you were just waiting,
you were waiting for a sale,

100
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:47,465
this the time, this the
sale, so head on over there

101
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:50,109
if you're interested in
getting a shirt, sweater.

102
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:54,776
I have cell phone cases,
pillow cases as well, and mugs.

103
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:58,132
Yeah that's really it; I
just really wanted to get on

104
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:02,053
and just say thank you
for helping me hit 13k.

105
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:03,220
I really appreciate it.

106
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,853
Sorry that I kind of haven't
been sticking to the schedule,

107
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:09,169
because I was prepping for this project,

108
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,454
and now I'm on this project,
and then I've also been working

109
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:15,808
on wrapping up my Creators
for Change project.

110
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:18,020
So it's been a lot going on so I kind of

111
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,834
had to be a little more loose
with the video schedule,

112
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,943
but hopefully by the end of September,

113
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:27,943
I'll be back to regularly
scheduled programming if you will.

114
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,254
And then also, from the Patreon producers,

115
00:05:30,254 --> 00:05:35,249
I will be scheduling our next
livestream together soon.

116
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:38,319
So make sure to check me
out Patreon.com/Hallease.

117
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,009
I'll be sending out some
dates on when we can do

118
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:44,428
our next livestream and
hang out session together.

119
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,331
If you don't already know,
with the Patreon producers,

120
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:48,975
every month I do a private livestream,

121
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:52,143
and then it goes live on
the channel after the fact,

122
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,484
so you don't get to be live
in it, you see it after.

123
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:58,368
In order to be live in it, and
know when it's going to be,

124
00:05:58,368 --> 00:05:59,758
and get a private link to join,

125
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:02,116
you need to be a Patreon
producer of the channel,

126
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:06,033
and my Patreon's super
basic, it's two dollars.

127
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:09,558
Two dollars.

128
00:06:09,558 --> 00:06:11,233
(laughs)

129
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,465
And the two dollars is like, a suggestion.

130
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:16,030
Literally you can give whatever
you want and you're in.

131
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,464
So, it's super basic.

132
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:21,174
But yeah, you get early access to videos,

133
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,083
the private livestreams with me.

134
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,914
Oh, Patreon producers will always

135
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:26,953
and forever get 20% off merch,

136
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,883
and they have their own
private code for that,

137
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:31,952
that will never go away, so yeah.

138
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:33,987
If you're interested,
Patreon's where it's at.

139
00:06:33,987 --> 00:06:35,651
That's how you really can
stay in contact with me,

140
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:38,943
get input on video ideas
and things like that.

141
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:40,002
So it's just like a better way

142
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:42,076
to just like stay direct
in contact with me.

143
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:44,321
You also get a private
Facebook group too, so.

144
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,346
So if you're interested,
and if the spirit moves you,

145
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:49,392
consider joining the
Patreon production team.

146
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,505
It's a cool bunch; cool
bunch of folks over there.

147
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:53,136
Just saying; just throwing that out there.

148
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:54,638
And yeah, I think that's kind of it.

149
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:56,721
That's kind of it, y'all.

150
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,967
I'm sorry, I really, man
it is hard to balance

151
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:04,854
this freelancer life with everything else,

152
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:06,852
but I really am anxious.

153
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:08,723
I really just wanted to put something out.

154
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:11,196
Like seriously, it really does bother me

155
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:16,196
when a week has gone by, and
I haven't talked to y'all.

156
00:07:16,328 --> 00:07:20,441
Like it really irks me,
you know what I'm saying?

157
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,614
Oh, in the comments below,

158
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:23,645
let me know when you first
started following me.

159
00:07:23,645 --> 00:07:26,581
What was my subscriber
count, because, I just,

160
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:30,114
let's be nostalgic, if you
will for a little while.

161
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:32,995
But yeah, because I am
still kinda in limbo,

162
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,355
I'll see you when I see you.

163
00:07:35,355 --> 00:00:00,000
(calm music)
