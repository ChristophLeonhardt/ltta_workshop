REPUBLICANS INSISTING ON A
TRANSCRIBED INTERVIEW UNDER
OATH.
ON FOX THIS WEEKEND CHAIRMAN
GOODLATTE IS CONSIDERING THE
STEP OF COMPELLING ROSENSTEIN'S
TESTIMONY.
>> IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE TALK
TO HIM.
HE KNOWS THAT.
HE HAS NOT AGREED TO COME FOR A
TRANSCRIBED INTERVIEW ON THE
RECORD.
HE NEEDS TO AGREE TO DO THAT.
IF HE DOES NOT AGREE TO DO THAT
VERY SOON, I WILL ISSUE A
SUBPOENA FOR HIM TO APPEAR.
>> TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT
ON AIR FORCE ONE COLUMBUS DAY
THOSE CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT
SAID ROSENSTEIN INSISTED TO HIS
BOSS HIS COMMENTS ABOUT
RECORDING THE PRESIDENT AND
INVOKEING THE 25th AMENDMENT TO
REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE WERE
SARCASTIC, NOT SERIOUS.
HE DID NOT COME UP TO THE HILL
TO CLEAR UP ANY CONCLUSION.
THE PRESIDENT TOLD FOX HE WAS
SURPRISED BY HIS DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S DECISION AS
AOLT WITNESS GAVE TESTIMONY AT
ODDS WITH ROSENSTEIN'S VERSION
OF EVENTS.
>> Heather: WE LEARNED MORE
ABOUT THE SURVEILLANCE RECORD
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WILL
RELEASE.
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT W
THAT?
>> THE PRESIDENT TWEETED HE
WOULD IMMEDIATELY DECLASSIFY
THE SURVEILLANCE RECORDS FROM
THE 2016 ELECTION AND BACKED
OFF.
ON SUNDAY MORNING CONGRESSMAN
JOHN RATCLIFFE SAID THE RECORDS
CONTAIN EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE
THAT UNDERCUTS THE PRETEXT FOR
OPENING THE RUSSIA PROBE BASED
ON GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS AND
ALLEGED EFFORTS TO ATTAIN
HILLARY CLINTON'S HACKED EMAILS.
RATCLIFFE SAYS THERE IS
EVIDENCE THAT CONFLICTS WITH
THE CLAIMS AND KNOWS THE
EVIDENCE FIRSTHAND.
>> I HAVE SEEN THEM AND TELL
YOU THAT THE FORMER FEDERAL
PROSECUTOR MY OPINION IS THAT
DECLASSIFYING THEM WOULD NOT
EXPOSE ANY NATIONAL SECURITY
INFORMATION.
WOULD NOT EXPOSE ANY SOURCES
AND METHODS.
IT WOULD EXPOSE CERTAIN FOLKS
AT THE OBAMA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
AND F.B.I. AND THEIR ACTIONS
AND THEIR ACTIONS TAKEN TO
CONCEAL MATERIAL FACTS FROM THE
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE
SURVEILLANCE COURT.
>> FOUNDER OF FUSION GPS GLENN
SIMPSON IS UNDER SUBPOENA TO
APPEAR ON CAPITOL HILL TOMORROW.
HE PLANS TO TAKE THE FIFTH.
A FOX NEWS REVIEW OF
CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY BRITISH
COURT RECORDS, EMAILS AND OTHER
DOCUMENTS INDICATE THAT AT
LEAST FIVE SEPARATE SOURCES
WORKED THROUGH OTHER GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES OR FED THE DOSSIER
DIRECTLY TO THE F.B.I. BEFORE
AND AFTER THE 2016 ELECTION.
CRITICS CALL IT THE DOSSIER
