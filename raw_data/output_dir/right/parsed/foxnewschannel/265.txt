>> Harris: BREAKING NEWS,
KANYE WEST IN THE OVAL OFFICE,
WATCH.
>> THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND GIVE
OPPORTUNITY.
A LOT OF TIMES IT'S JUST AN
OVERALL LACK OF PREPARATION AT
ANY GIVEN POINT.
WE SAY THIS IS RACIST, THIS IS
RACIST, THIS IS RACIST.
WE HAD TO OPEN UP THE WHOLE
CONVERSATION.
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOODS I LOVE
THAT LIBERALS TRY TO DO,
LIBERALS WILL TRY TO CONTROL A
BLACK
PERSON BECAUSE THEY KNOW
WE ARE VERY PROUD, EMOTIONAL
PEOPLE.
TO SOMEONE THAT'S LIBERAL, THEY
WILL SAY "HE'S RACIST."
YOU THINK RACISM CAN CONTROL ME?
THAT'S AN INVISIBLE WALL.
YOU HAVE ONE QUESTION TO ANOTHER
QUESTION, I DON'T ANSWER
QUESTIONS FOR SOUND BITES, YOU
ARE TASTING A FINE WINE.
IT'S LIKE "MINORITY REPORT," IT
AIN'T THAT SIMPLE, IT'S COMP
LAST.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD
LIKE TO ASK PRESIDENT TRUMP TO
DO FOR CHICAGO.
>> THE THING THAT THE HEAD OF
THE POLICE MET WITH ME LAST
NIGHT, IT DOES NOT HELP THE
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE CITY AND
EVERYONE THAT KNEW I WAS COMING
HERE ASKED ABOUT STOP AND FRISK.
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING WE
ARE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION
ABOUT.
ANOTHER THING IS OPENING IT UP
IN THE STREETS, WE'VE GOT TO GET
SOME TAX BREAKS.
THE SHOES ARE COSTING US $300,
WE NEED SOME PROTOTYPES HERE SO
WE CAN GET PEOPLE BACK WORKING
SO CHINA CAN'T JUST BEAT US, THE
GREATEST JEANS COMPANY IN THE
WORLD MAKING THEIR GENES IN
VIETNAM.
WERE GOING TO NEED TO GET A FEW
BREAKS TO HAVE SOME PLACES IN MY
HOMETOWN OF CHICAGO,
2.7 MILLION, 9 MILLION AROUND
THE SUBURBS TO CREATE SOME
FACTORIES.
I THINK IT WOULD BE COOL IF THEY
WERE TRUMP FACTORIES, BECAUSE
HE'S A MASTER OF INDUSTRY, HE'S
A BUILDER.
A MIX OF EDUCATION THAT EMPOWERS
PEOPLE AND GIVES THEM MODERN
INFORMATION.
SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS KID HAS
A.D.D., THIS KID HAS A.D.D.
HE DOESN'T HAVE A.D.D., SCHOOL
IS BORING.
WE NEED TO MAKE IT MORE EXCITIN
EXCITING.
JUST LIKE BASKETBALL WHILE
YOU'RE DOING MATH, YOU LEARN
ABOUT MUSIC WHILE YOU MEDITATE
IN THE MORNING.
MENTAL HEALTH AND ART PROGRAMS,
THOSE ARE -- AND ALSO, LARRY
HOOVER.
AN EXAMPLE OF A MAN TURNING HIS
LIFE AROUND, THEY HIT HIM WITH
SIX LIFE SENTENCES.
YOU SAY DON'T TEAR DOWN THE
STATUE, LARRY HOOPER IS A LIVING
STATUE, HE'S A BEACON FOR US.
YOU HAVE A BLOCK LEADER ON EVERY
SINGLE BLOCK, THEY WOULD ON THE
BLOCK.
IT'S SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM
JIM BROWN, WE NEED TO PUT
CURRICULUMS FOR PEOPLE WHO
REALLY CAME FROM THE STREETS,
NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST TRYING
TO SET US UP TO GO INTO A PRISON
SYSTEM THAT APPLIES TO WHAT
PEOPLE ARE REALLY ONTO WHICH JIM
JIM BROWN HAS CREATED.
THE PROBLEM IS THE LEGAL GUNS,
THE LEGAL GUNS OF THE PROBLEM.
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID HE
FAVORS STOP AND FRISK, WILL YOU
BE DISCUSSING THAT?
>> I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT YOU ON
THE SPOT.
WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT.
>> HE CAN SPEAK FOR ME ANYTIME
HE WANTS, GREAT GUY.
SMART COOKIE.
HE GETS IT.
JIM BROWN, HE'S BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.
COULD VERY WELL BE.
>> THE THING IS, LET'S STOP
WORRYING ABOUT THE FUTURE.
ALL WE REALLY HAVE IS TODAY.
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,
THAT HEROES JOURNEY.
TRUMP IS ON HIS HEROES JOURNEY.
BUT BEST BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO
MAKE AMERICA GREAT.
ANOTHER THING IS BLACK PEOPLE
HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE WORD
AGAIN AND MY FEELINGS ON THAT,
I'M GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY.
ALL WE HAVE IS NOW, ALL WE HAVE
IS TODAY.
IT HURTS US BECAUSE WE NEED TO
FOCUS ON WHO WE ARE NOW.
I BROUGHT SOME HATS IN, A BIT OF
A TRANSITION.
I MADE A HAT THAT SAYS "MAKE
AMERICA GREAT."
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE AT THE
SUPER BOWL TRUMP WEARING THE
MAKE AMERICA GREAT HAT, COMMON
WEARING THE MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AND SHOWING WE CAN BEND A BIT ON
THIS SIDE, BEND A BIT ON THIS
SIDE AND LEARN HOW TO BE
MALLEABLE, THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO
STICK -- WE ARE ONE UNIT, WE ARE
ONE COUNTRY.
WE ARE ONE MOMENT IN HISTORY AND
IN TIME.
THE GREATEST VALUE PEOPLE HAVE
OTHER PEOPLE AND WE CAN STOP.
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS QUESTION,
YOU'RE IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE IN THE
OVAL OFFICE.
>> IT IS GOOD ENERGY.
>> JIM, HOW DO YOU FEEL?
>> I FEEL GOOD.
YOU ARE SO RESPECTED, WHAT KANYE
HAS BEEN DOING HAS BEEN
INCREDIBLE, ALL OVER THE WORLD
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS, I
HAD IMPORTANT MEETINGS TODAY
WITH SENATORS, NOBODY CARED,
THEY WANTED THIS MEETING.
IS THAT RIGHT?
THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT.
IT'S MY HONOR, JIM.
I'VE BEEN A FAN OF YEARS FOR A
LONG TIME, A LONG TIME.
NOBODY LIKE YOU.
NO ATHLETE LIKE YOU.
>> I'M HERE TO SERVE.
>> THAT'S ALL THE     ALWAYS BEH
>> THAT'S ALL THE     ALWAYS BEE
WAY JIM HAS BEEN, A LONG TIME.
IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL.
JENNIFER, DID YOU HAVE A
QUESTION?
I AM OPEN TO EVERYTHING.
I THINK IT'S A SHAME WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN CHICAGO.
I'M IN CHICAGO A LOT, TOO.
I HAVE NICE THINGS IN CHICAGO,
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
I HATE TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.
THEY'RE HAVING NUMBERS, NUMBERS
OF PEOPLE BEING SHOT AND KILLED,
IT'S NOT FOR THIS COUNTRY.
SO THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AND
I AM TOTALLY OPEN, WE CAN DO IT
A DIFFERENT WAY, I'M TOTALLY
OPEN.
WE ALL AGREE THEY HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING, THAT'S FOR SURE.
MAYBE IT'S A COMBINATION OF
BOTH, I GUESS IT IS BUT I THINK
IT'S PROBABLY A COMBINATION OF
BOTH AND ALSO IT'S A RESPECT
ISSUE.
THEY RESPECT THIS GUY, THEY
RESPECT TO THIS GUY, IT'S A BIG
THING.
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE NOT
RESPECTING, LET'S SAY YOUR MAYOR
OR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN CHICAGO,
CERTAINLY IT SHOULDN'T BE
HAPPENING, WHAT'S GOING ON THERE
SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING.
HONESTLY, FROM OUR STANDPOINT,
THIS WAS JUST SET UP TO BE A
LUNCH OF TWO PEOPLE THAT I LIKE
AND I GUESS THEY LIKE ME AND WE
ARE GOING TO HAVE LUNCH AND TAL
TALK.
>> YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.
>> I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU IN
THAT SPOT.
>> I'M STANDING IN THAT SPOT, I
LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.
I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.
>> THAT'S REALLY NICE.
I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT YOU IN THAT
POSITION.
BUT THAT'S FROM THE HEART,
SPECIAL GUY.
THESE TWO ARE SPECIAL PEOPLE,
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR YOU DON'T
LIKE IT, THEY ARE SPECIAL PEOPLE
