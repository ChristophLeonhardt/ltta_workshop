00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:03,810
depressing horrible video that i<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,819
deleted because it was basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,400
being windy constantly about how grumpy

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,679
I am to be stuck at home today and I've

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,440
been ill quite badly ill I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,960
exhausted myself and I think I gotta

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,310
chill and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh which</font>

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,590
sucks me because I don't like skipping

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,810
school and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't like being stuck at</font>

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,180
home and the problem was that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,949
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> say the source it my eyes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,510
focus i can't read something and I

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,859
really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read a lot of stuff</font>

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">worried a lot of stuff that I was really</font>

16
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,739
inspired by<font color="#CCCCCC"> various things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened</font>

17
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,570
today and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about writing lots</font>

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,460
of random essays about books I enjoy not

19
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,899
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> school or anything but just cuz the</font>

20
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">come thing that I do for weird it was a</font>

21
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,379
shame but instead I just I ended up

22
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,200
listening to podcast and and watching

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,750
that first episode of the documentary

24
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">about Terry Pratchett that was on BBC on</font>

25
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,579
Wednesday yesterday evening and that i

26
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,219
missed and is actually credibly sad but

27
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,260
it's very good he's very honest and

28
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,670
Terry fetch it was diagnosed with

29
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,820
outsiders last year and it's not so much

30
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,860
that he forgets<font color="#E5E5E5"> things but that he finds</font>

31
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,229
it hard to visualize things and his

32
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,100
typing for one it's just so slow now he

33
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,229
used to be such a fast typist and he's

34
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you really get a sense of his</font>

35
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,159
frustration<font color="#E5E5E5"> as anger and it's just</font>

36
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,740
fascinating program but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's</font>

37
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,420
really harrowing as well then watching

38
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,670
random things in<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube and listening</font>

39
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,799
to 90's music and just trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

40
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,509
distract myself from how crappy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt</font>

41
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,310
basically and order lots things from the

42
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,470
library as well but I was most dad that

43
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,990
i miss my hand at lesson because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am a</font>

44
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,390
huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> nique and I love my hammock</font>

45
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,479
blessings they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really in every way</font>

46
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,729
and I really enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

47
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:42,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about happen to you right now</font>

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,670
instead of doing it randomly or<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought</font>

49
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me but I also will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably do that</font>

50
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,329
sometime as well properly drug<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid and</font>

51
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,549
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a bit about the great so</font>

52
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,110
Luke Reid to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not to be that is the</font>

53
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,640
question whether it is nobler in the

54
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,140
mind to suffer the slings and arrows of

55
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,299
outrageous fortune which take arms

56
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,530
against a sea of troubles and by

57
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,229
opposing end them etc cetera it's become

58
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,759
a cliche it's become the cliché of

59
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,860
Shakespeare cliche of Hamlet the cliché

60
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,879
of drama the cliché of solar degrees and

61
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,110
the one of the apps you in the dream

62
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,120
role and everything

63
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,760
in a way it's a shame because it is just

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,409
brilliant I think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have stopped</font>

65
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:17,980
thinking so critically about it is

66
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,620
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that it's about suicide</font>

67
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">and depression and in many ways it's</font>

68
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,019
kind of hard to get another level from

69
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:30,379
it because it's so obvious that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he is</font>

70
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:32,629
depressed and he's not kind of not in

71
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:34,129
the same way that oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this too too</font>

72
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:38,329
solid flesh would map a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> way but</font>

73
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Justin just completely suicidal to be</font>

74
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,840
honest i love the line in<font color="#E5E5E5"> conscience</font>

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,170
makes cowards of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us all that even in our</font>

76
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,829
moments of complete suffering we are too

77
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:51,950
scared of life after<font color="#CCCCCC"> death most of us to</font>

78
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,209
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through with things it's</font>

79
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:55,700
such a beautiful piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing and it</font>

80
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,200
is a shame<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's been so highly</font>

81
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,810
scrutinized or west<font color="#E5E5E5"> because now people</font>

82
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,840
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that as much anymore the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">honorable and courageous opposition to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the description</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of life is like a mortal</font>

coil you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to be alive is a</font>

business and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sir it's a system and</font>

91
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,760
it's an industry and it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get free from under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

93
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,859
that we're kind of fighting against it's

94
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:40,220
powerful stuff man it's central to his

95
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,010
personal conflict and everything he's so

96
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,569
uncomfortable with the idea of death

97
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:48,709
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he believes that he's seen</font>

98
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,109
his father and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses the mousetrap to</font>

99
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:52,910
prove to himself<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though he's seen</font>

100
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,290
someone come back from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dead he's</font>

101
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,019
still not comfortable with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of</font>

102
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:00,410
dying and he's still full of that fear

103
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,120
of the arts life and it kind of it

104
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,590
brings<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the question how much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does it</font>

105
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">take for us to have faith that there's</font>

106
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,459
life after death and should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have that</font>

107
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:10,340
faith and is it better for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of</font>

108
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,919
remain trapped to feel like we're

109
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,379
trapped to life and tied to it in a way

110
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,930
that we weren't necessarily enjoy and to

111
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,409
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go on with that suffering or</font>

112
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:22,790
should we be braver and

113
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,800
end it it's as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a shame that</font>

114
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,500
I think it's become a cliche that's part

115
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,560
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and my random Hamlet analysis</font>

116
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,930
give me any ideas what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

117
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,280
the great cynically because I think it

118
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,460
is it is wonderful just the phrasing it

119
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,520
it's the best it's the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> race for in</font>

120
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,930
that sleep of death what dreams may come

121
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,460
when we have shuffled off this mortal

122
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,860
coil must give us pause there's a

123
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,450
respect that makes calamity of so long

124
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,570
life my favorite line is and by a sleep

125
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,580
to say we end the heartache and the

126
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,200
thousand natural shocks that flesh is

127
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,600
heir to the thousand natural shocks it's

128
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,870
just it's amazing but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were day now</font>

brilliant and so touching at the same
