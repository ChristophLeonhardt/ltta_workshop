RETURNING FOUR YEARS LATER AFTER SERVING A PRIME MINISTER A MOVE HE COULD DO AGAIN. ABBEY? ABBY: THANK YOU, GRIFF PRESIDENT TRUMP AT A PRO-LIFE GALA EARLIER THIS WEEK HIGHLIGHTING THE HEARTWARMING ADOPTION STORY A FOUR YEAR OLD KATHERINE ALEXANDER BORN WITH AN OPIOID DEPENDENCY WHO TRUMP CALLED ON TO THE STAGE TO MEET WITH HIM, WATCH. PRESIDENT TRUMP: KATHERINE'S FOUR YEARS OLD AND SHE IS FULL OF INCREDIBLE ENERGY, SPIRIT AND TALENT. WHEN SHE GROWS UP SHE WANTS TO BE A FAMOUS POLICE OFFICER AND THEN, WHEN SHE GETS TIRED OF THAT, SHE WANTS TO BECOME PRESIDENT. THAT'S OKAY. ABBY: WHAT A SWEET MOMENT THAT WAS SO WHAT EXACTLY DID TRUMP SAY IN THAT TOUCHING MOMENT? LISA AND BRUCE ALEXANDER ALONG WITH THEIR NEW FAMOUS FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER KATHERINE JOIN US THIS MORNING. GREAT TO HAVE YOU ALL ON AND WHAT A SWEET MOMENT THAT WAS. I WANT TO START LISA WITH YOU ON THIS STORY OF KATHERINE BECAUSE YOU ALL THOUGHT YOUR PARENTING YEARS WERE OVER HOW DID CAT GET INTO YOUR LIFE? WELL IT WAS IN 2012 WE WENT TO THE MARCH FOR LIFE, THE MASS AT ST. MATTHEWS AND THERE WAS A GUEST SPEAKER THAT HAD ADOPTED THEIR FAMILY HAD ADOPTED SIX OF THEIR CHILDREN, ALL SIX OF THEM, AND THE MOTHER LOOKED TO BE MY AGE, AND SO I LATER GOT IN TOUCH WITH HER AND SHE IN FACT WAS CLOSE TO MY AGE WHICH WAS 48 AT THE TIME AND THEN THAT STARTED THE WHOLE PROCESS. WE JUST FELT CALLED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT TO FOLLOW THAT PATH AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE AND WE HAVE KATHERINE. ABBY: BRUCE THE MINUTE YOU LOOKED INTO KAT'S EYES WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND? THIS IS MY DAUGHTER AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS STRANGE OR ALMOST COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT CLEARLY, AS LISA SAID, YOU KNOW, WE FELT CALLED TO THIS MOMENT AND WE FELT CALLED TO KAT AND KA T SPECIFICALLY AND SO IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT. SAME AS IF MEETING ANY ONE OF THE BIRTH OF ANY OF OUR OTHER FOUR CHILDREN. ABBY: I HAVE TWO ADOPTED SISTERS , IT IS AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE FOR ANYONE WHOSE BEEN THROUGH THAT LISA JUST TO REMIND OUR AUDIENCE THOUGH IT WAS KATHERINE'S MOM WHO GAVE BIRTH AND FOUND OUT THAT KAT HAD AN OPIOID DEPENDENCY AND DECIDED TO GIVE HER UP FOR ADOPTION HOW IS SHE DOING NOW. SHE'S FOUR YEARS OLD. SHE'S JUST A TYPICAL FOUR YEAR OLD. EVEN FROM THE TIME WE GOT HER SHE WAS WEENED IN THE HOSPITAL SO MEDICALLY, I THINK ALL THE MEDICAL PROBLEMS AS FAR AS THE DOCTORS TOLD US WERE FINE AND YOU WOULD FROM THE DAY WE GOT HER, THERE WAS NOTHING DIFFERENT ABBY: SHE IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL. BRUCE, WALK US THROUGH THAT MOMENT YOU TOOK HER UP ON STAGE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP EARLIER THIS WEEK. HE HAS NOW MADE KATHERINE FAMOUS , WALK US THROUGH THAT MOMENT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN YOUR MIND AND WHAT DO YOU THINK KATHERINE WAS THINKING IN THAT MOMENT? WELL, THE FIRST THING WAS IS WE WERE CERTAINLY NOT EXPECTING TO GO UP THERE. WE WERE AWARE THAT AS PART OF THE LARGER GALA THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME RECOGNITION OF ADOPTION, THE ADOPTION OPTION, SO WE'RE JUST FOCUSED ON THAT AND THEN OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT SAID COME ON UP KATHERINE AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME, IT WAS ALMOST SURREAL FROM THAT POINT, YOU KNOW, FORWARD, AND WE MADE OUR WAY TO THE STAGE, KATHERINE AND I AND THEN ONE OF OUR OTHER DAUGHTERS, TAYLOR WE ALSO MADE IT UP THERE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN KATHERINE'S MIND AT THAT TIME BUT I WILL TELL YOU SHE'S AWARE WHO THE PRESIDENT IS, SO AT LEAST FROM THAT ASPECT I THINK SHE THOUGHT IT WAS AT LEAST ENTERTAINING SHE WAS THINKING. ABBY: BRUCE WHAT WAS HE SAYING TO YOU IN THAT MOMENT? I HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, SORT OF CAVEAT IT OR FRAME IT BY SAYING THE PRESIDENT WAS INCREDIBLY GRACIOUS. AS WE GOT UP TO THE STAGE, HE THANKED KATHERINE FOR COMING UP, ASKED HER HOW SHE WAS DOING. HE MENTIONED HE WAS HAPPY THAT SHE WAS THERE. HIM AND I, WE HAD A BRIEF EXCHANGE AS WELL. HE THANKED ME FOR ALSO COMING UP , BUT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED OUR EFFORTS IN THIS PARTICULAR STORY AND I WILL ALSO SAY THAT MOST OF HIS ATTENTION, AND I CERTAINLY CAN RECOGNIZE THAT AS A FIVE- TIME FATHER WAS QUITE FRANKLY GENUINELY GIVEN TOWARDS KATHERINE. ABBY: WELL WHAT A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN YOU GUYS ARE RAISING THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US AND FORETELLING THE SPECIAL STORY SO MANY CAN RELATE TO AND BRUCE,
