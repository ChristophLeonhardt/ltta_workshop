we've heard it all now mi5 and mi6 should focus less on keeping the country safe and more on becoming diverse so get this MPs are complaining that the UK's intelligence services that's mi5 and mi6 aren't diverse enough as if race has anything at all to do with keeping this country safe so mi6 which deals with the overseas intelligence they're my five which deals with intelligence here at home had no black or ethnic minority members of their top posts between 2016 and 2017 I mean does anyone really care does this matter at this point it's not like the mi5 mi6 the intelligence services in the UK by the way it's swimming in people applying to join these services and applying for these top posts and that they're suddenly knocking anyone back if they're black or ethnic minority this is not a deliberate attempt to create a an organization that's entirely white which by the way is not the case they're just saying the top posts don't have anyone from a black or ethnic minority background it's simply a matter of the best people have been given the best jobs and the limited amount of people that have applied out of those people they've happened to be white sorry but we know that they're not chock-a-block with people applying to become spies for instance in mi5 mi6 because actually there's new adverts going out I heard one on the radio the other day that unfortunately I've been unable to find but there was a TV advert as well for mi6 so have a quick look at this we are intelligence officers no you don't do what you think it's not keeping your cool in a shark tank it's picking up on the silent cues that matter understanding others helping them see things differently is exploring the world beyond your own and if that sounds familiar is because you do it every day mi6 secretly well just like you so there we have it that's the first TV advert for the UK secret services secretly we're just like you I mean is that really what we want people to think across the world of the UK secret services they talk about trying to get rid of this idea of it's like working with James Bond but I'd much rather the world thought it was like working with James Bond than it is working in I know it they make it seem like it's working in some multicultural council office that's hire people on diversity quotas it's pathetic is this the message that we want spread around the whole world now The Guardian reported on a report by the members of parliament talking about this lack of ethnic diversity in our secret services and they wrote the report describes the lack of ba and E staff in its senior posts as lamentable on lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people the report records three percent of staff at mi6 choosing to declare themselves as LGBT 4.4 percent in mi5 and 1.3 percent in GCHQ quote it's not clear why the declaration rates for the agencies are lower for this group and for staff declaring as B am II particularly as the LGBT groups across the agencies and organisations are high profile and well established the report says so there we have it mi5 doesn't have enough gay people doesn't have enough trans people doesn't have enough black people doesn't have enough brown people doesn't have enough Chinese people God knows what else it's ludicrous we've got to the point where it doesn't really matter whether you're qualified for the job it's as long as you've met fit the diversity quota then you're in I just want to know that the secret services in the UK are run by intelligent knowledgeable talented experienced people with all the right qualifications all the right abilities you know in all honesty mi5 could be made up in highly of black guys who identify as Barbara on Wednesdays as long as they're doing the job and doing a bloody good job at that then I'm happy but I guess we can add the UK secret services to the same list as the Armed Forces in organisations that have started ramping up the online and TV advertisements calling for a more diverse workforce it's insane if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
