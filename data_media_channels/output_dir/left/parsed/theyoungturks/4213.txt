UNITED AIRLINES IS IN TROUBLE
AGAIN AFTER A FAMILY FROM
TEXAS AS THEIR DOG DIED WHILE IN
THE CARGO HOLD OF A PLANE
THAT WAS DELAYED FOR TWO HOURS.
THE DOG IS NAMED LULU.
LULU WAS A FIVE-YEAR-OLD
CAVALIER KING CHARLES
SPANIEL AND WAS CLEARED BY A
VETERINARIAN TO FLY DAYS
BEFORE LULU WAS BOARDED ON THE
PLANE.
THE FAMILY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS
GOING ON SO FAR.
UNITED HAS RESPONDED WITH A
STATEMENT.
INTERESTINGLY, SINCE 2012,
ONE THIRD OF ALL ANIMAL TESTS
ON US CARRIERS OCCURRED ON
UNITED AIRLINES.
I LOOKED UP, THERE WERE 136
ANIMAL TESTS ON US PLANES DURING
THAT TIME.
53 WERE ATTRIBUTED TO UNITED
AIRLINES A.
THAT IS INSANE.
THEY SAY ON THE RARE
OCCURRENCE.
THAT ISRAEL GIVEN THE NUMBER
OF FLIGHTS THERE IS, BUT
APPARENTLY A LITTLE LESS RARE IF
IT IS ON UNITED.
LOOK, THEY'RE DIFFERENT AIRLINES
HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES FOR
DIFFERENT REASONS.
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'S A GREAT
BOOK ABOUT WHY KOREAN AIRLINES
CRASH MORE IN THE PAST, NOT
TODAY AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THE
COPILOTS, BECAUSE OF CULTURAL
REASONS, WERE TOO POLITE
THAT EVEN IF THEY WERE ABOUT TO
MOVE INTO A MOUNTAIN, THEY
WOULD NOT SELL THE PILOT, HEY,
WATCH OUT WE ARE ABOUT TO DIE.
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TOO RUDE AND
SO THEY WOULD CRUSH INTO
THE MOUNTAIN EVERYONE WITH THAT
WHICH SEEMS A LITTLE ROUTER.
THAT IS A REAL STORY.
IT IS
AMAZING, DIDN'T HAPPEN
FREQUENTLY, BUT HAPPENED
MORE FREQUENTLY ON KOREAN
AIR IN THE PAST.
THEY'VE CORRECTED FOR IT.
THERE'S SOME CHANCE THAT UNITED
IS DOING SOMETHING A LITTLE
WRONG.
IN THIS PARTICULAR
CASE, THEY SAY THE AIR
CONDITIONING HAD GONE OUT IN THE
MAIN CABIN.
IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR THE
DOG IN THE CARGO HOLD.
THAT IS VERY LIKELY WHAT
HAPPENED, BUT THEY WANT TO
INVESTIGATE FIND OUT FOR SURE.
WHAT I NEVER UNDERSTAND IS
FIRST OF ALL, WHAT ARE THEY
BORED PEOPLE ON THE PLANE WHEN
THEY KNOW OR BEFORE THEY
HAVE CHECKED TO MAKE SURE THAT
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE STUCK
ON THE TARMAC FOR A COUPLE OF
HOURS BEFORE THE FLIGHT
HAPPENS OR WHY DON'T YOU MAKE
SURE THAT WHEN WE LAND,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO STAY
ON THE TARMAC FOR SEVERAL
HOURS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT IS
A COMMON THING.
THERE BEEN MULTIPLE TIMES WHERE
YOU ARE STUCK ON THE TARMAC
FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN ADDITION TO
THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU'RE STUCK
ON THE PLANE AND MIRACULOUSLY,
THEY'RE CONDITIONING ALWAYS
NOW FUNCTIONS WHEN YOU ARE STUCK
ON THE TARMAC.
THERE WAS A STORY THAT WE DIDN'T
GET TO A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
WHERE PEOPLE WERE LITERALLY
STUCK ON THE PLANE ON THE TARMAC
FOR OVER FIVE HOURS AND PEOPLE
STARTED THROWING UP BECAUSE
AIR-CONDITIONING WASN'T WORKING.
THEY WERE GIVING OUT FOOD.
THE ONLY THING THAT THEY WOULD
GIVE OUT WAS WATER AND IT
IS JUST RIDICULOUS.
ONE PERSON ACTUALLY CALLED 911.
AN AMBULANCE SHOWED UP AT THEY
SAID WE CAN'T TAKE YOU OFF
THE PLANE.
I DON'T GET WHY IT IS SO
DIFFICULT TO GET THE PEOPLE
OFF OF THE PLANE ESPECIALLY
IF YOU HAVE SEVERAL
INDIVIDUALS THROWING UP.
I DON'T KNOW, IT IS THIS WEIRD
AIRLINE POLICY THAT I'VE
NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT I'M SURE
THERE MIGHT BE A GOOD
REASON FOR IT, BUT IT IS NOT A
GOOD IDEA.
I FEEL BAD FOR PET OWNERS.
I HAVE A PET TO, BUT PUTTING IT
ON A PLANE IS A LITTLE BIT
DANGEROUS.
WE DON'T KNOW WHY THEY HAVE ALL
THE ISSUES THAT THEY DO AND
I'VE COURSE HAD A SOMEWHAT
INFAMOUS FIGHT WITH AMERICAN
AIRLINES WHERE I THOUGHT THEY
WERE ACTING IRRATIONALLY
AND BY THE WAY, WAS PROVEN RIGHT
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THEY
DID HAVE A PLANE WERE CHOOSING
NOT TO BRING IT SO SOMETIMES
THEY ARE IN A DIFFICULT SPOT AND
THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO.
SOMETIMES THERE IS SOMETHING
THEY CAN DO, THEY JUST
DON'T WANT TO DO IT BUT IF YOUR
PET IS IN THE CARGO HOLD AND
IT THEN IT BECOMES A LITTLE BIT
MORE MATTER OF URGENCY FOR YOU.
HEY WE HAVE TO FIX THIS THING,
OTHERWISE LULU IS GOING TO DIE.
I LOOKED INTO IT TOO, A
LOT OF PEOPLE ONLINE OR
ORGANIZATIONS ONLINE SEEM TO
HAVE AN ISSUE WITH PLACING
ANIMALS IN THE KERNEL TO BEGIN
WITH BECAUSE THEY ARE
LIVING CREATURES AND THEIR
DIFFERENT CONDITIONS DOWN THERE.
ACCORDING TO PETA, 300 ANIMALS
HAVE DIED IN CARGO HOLDS IN
U.S. AIRPLANES SINCE 2005.
IT GOES BACK TO WHAT YOU WERE
SAYING.
WHY THIS NEEDLESS REGULATION,
WHY DOES THIS DEFY COMMON
SENSE EVEN THOUGHT WE ARE
GOING TO DO THIS?
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE?
DOES IT
HELP PEOPLE?
I'M NOT SAYING IT IS AN EASY
ISSUE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
YOUR PIT BULL SITTING NEXT TO
ME.
WE'RE STUCK IN A PLANE, IF
WE ARE STUCK WITH NO
AIR-CONDITIONING FOR FIVE HOURS
AND A PITBULL IS BREATHING
DOWN MY NECK, I'M NOT
IN FAVOR OF THAT.
I'M KEEPING IT
REAL ABOUT THAT.
IF HE IS IN THE CARGO HOLD, AND
THE OTHER HAND, IT'S GOING TO
ALMOST CERTAINLY DIE AND I
DON'T WANT YOUR DOG TO DIE.
WE
DON'T HAVE A GREAT
ANSWER HERE.
YOU GO WITH WHAT IS GOOD FOR
HEALTH AND BEING ON LIVE.
IT'S A BALANCE.
I GET IT.
I'M A DOG OWNER, I
LOVE DOGS SO SOMETIMES I
DON'T CONSIDER HOW OTHER PEOPLE
FEEL ABOUT DOGS BECAUSE IN
MY EYES 
IT IS LIKE YEAH, JUST
LET THE DOG ON THE PLANE.
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?
WHAT IS ABOUT TO BE IN 
THE CARGO
HOLD, BUT YOU ARE RIGHT.
