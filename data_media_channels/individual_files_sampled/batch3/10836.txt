this year's ela Berlin Expos underway in the German capital twelve thousand square metres of all things aviation from the commercial private and military sectors now just next to me are some of the drones currently operated by the German military this is the Heron and if we come over this way this is the Heron TP that's the one that can be equipped with weapons now they're made by an Israeli company in a joint partnership with the aerospace giant Airbus and over the next nine years Germany is set to spend a billion euro increasing the current fleet of these but Germany isn't just looking to buy in drones from abroad behind me is apparently the future it's called the European mail now it's a joint collaboration between Italy France Spain and Germany and the developers of this particular unmanned aircraft told me why those type of drones are the weapon of choice for modern European armies this is now the next step towards a kind of independence in Europe and that of course comes then along with a clear push into sovereignity meaning data sovereignty but also well when it comes to availability and so on also on display is this mock-up of the f-35 now this is Lockheed Martin's stealth jet that's being touted as a replacement for the tornado fighter bomber that's currently operated by the German military and it's not just the professionals they get to soar through the air using this tactical simulator of a helicopter I can even fly a mission over this small german town albeit that's rather a bumpy ride with me in charge companies from all over the world are showcasing their wares and Germany is in the market to buy the country's army chief has already called to hike defense spending by 15 billion euro by 2021 but opposition politicians aren't happy with that direction or the pressure being put on Germany by its NATO allies to spend more on the military this is the wrong direction in the moment there is Lex and the finance EA ssin of Education and the fancy Asian of the health system and Germany for example and there's no lack in Terry expanses and if you look at the German population German population wants peace if I walk around in Hamburg or in Berlin everyone say oh I want peace so I think the government have to listen listen to the population and we as the Left Party we bring forward that position and other actors humanist actors bring forward that position as well despite those dissenting voices it does seem that the German military is set for a funding boost and with that a load of new hardware Peter Oliver RT Berlin
