>> Sandra: THIS IS A FOX NEWS
ALERT.
SENATORS ON THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE NOW REVIEWING THAT
F.B.I. REPORT ON SUPREME COURT
NOMINEE BRETT KAVANAUGH.
ACCORDING TO A WHITE HOUSE
SOURCE THE BUREAU FOUND NOTHING
TO CORROBORATE ALLEGATIONS OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT.
SARAH SANDERS IS WITH US.
WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE
TO SAY THIS MORNING?
WE'RE GOING OFF THE TWEETS THE
PRESIDENT SENT OUT SO FAR.
WHAT ARE THE PRESIDENT'S
THOUGHTS THIS MORNING AS
SENATORS LOOK AT THAT?
>> OUR POSITION HAS BEEN PRETTY
CONSISTENT.
WE STAND 100% WITH BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
THE INFORMATION THAT WAS ASKED
AND REQUESTED BY SENATORS
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS NOW
BEEN PROVIDED AND AS CHAIRMAN
GRASSLEY SAID IN A STATEMENT
EARLIER THIS MORNING NOW THAT
THEY HAVE THAT INFORMATION,
IT'S TIME FOR THE SENATE TO
VOTE AND TIME FOR THEM TO
CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
>> Bill: I ASSUME THE PRESIDENT
HAS SEEN THE REPORT.
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT?
>> THE PRESIDENT IS WELL AWARE.
AS I SAID HE IS VERY CONFIDENT
IN HIS DECISION TO NOMINATE
BRETT KAVANAUGH TO THE SUPREME
COURT AND LOOKS FORWARD TO
SEEING HIM GET CONFIRMED OVER
THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS.
>> Bill: HAVE YOU SEEN AND READ
THE REPORT, SARAH?
>> THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I WOULD
BE PRIVY TO.
CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN TALKED TO
ABOUT THE CONTENTS AND AS YOU
SAW CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY'S
STATEMENT THAT JUST CAME OUT A
FEW MINUTES AGO, THERE IS
NOTHING NEW IN THIS REPORT THEY
DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW AND IT IS
TIME FOR THE SENATE TO VOTE.
EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN ASKED
BY THE DEMOCRATS IS OUT THERE.
>> Bill: WE'VE BEEN TOLD THE
F.B.I. FOUND DEBORAH RAMIREZ, A
CLASSMATE AT YALE WHO MADE THE
ALLEGATION DURING THEIR
FRESHMAN YEAR THERE.
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THE F.B.I.
CONCLUDED ABOUT ITS QUESTIONING
OF DEBORAH RAMIREZ ABOUT THAT
INCIDENT?
>> I CAN'T GET INTO THE WHO WAS
INTERVIEWED OR WHO WASN'T
INTERVIEWED.
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THE
WHITE HOUSE ACCOMMODATED THE
SENATE'S REQUEST IN WHAT THEY
WANTED TO SEE THE F.B.I. DO.
THE F.B.I. DID EXACTLY WHAT
THEY DO BEST AND THAT'S THEY
CONDUCTED A BACKGROUND
INVESTIGATION AND PROVIDED THAT
INFORMATION TO THE SENATE AND
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE SENATE TO
TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND MAKE
A DECISION WHETHER OR NOT THEY
SUPPORT JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
HE HAS GIVEN MORE THAN ANY
OTHER NOMINEE IN HISTORY IN
TERMS OF INTERVIEWS AND
DOCUMENTS AND TIME.
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE THIS
ENTIRE PROCESS A TOTAL DISGRACE.
IT IS TIME FOR THEM TO QUIT
PLAYING POLITICS AND START
DOING THEIR JOB AND LET'S PUT
THIS TO A VOTE AND LET'S DO IT
QUICKLY.
>> Sandra: THE PRESIDENT
TWEETED THIS MORNING ON THE
INCREDIBLE UPWARD IMPACT ON
VOTERS FROM THE UNFAIR
TREATMENT, AS HE CALLED IT, OF
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH.
EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT THE
PRESIDENT IS SAYING THERE.
>> WE'RE HEARING IT EVERY
SINGLE PLACE THE PRESIDENT HAS
GONE.
YOU CAN FEEL THE ENERGY BOTH
FOR THE PRESIDENT AND FOR HIS
NOMINEE IN BRETT KAVANAUGH.
PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED AT THE WAY
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TOTALLY MADE
THIS PROCESS INTO A PARTISAN
BATTLE AND THEY'VE CREATED
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NEVER
HAVE HAPPENED.
THEY'VE UPENDED OUR JUDICIAL
SYSTEM AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE
IS ENERGIZED REPUBLICANS AND
THE PRESIDENT IS FEELING THAT
ENERGY IN ALL OF THE LOCATIONS
HE HAS BEEN.
YOU'VE SEEN POLLING COME OUT IN
THE LAST DAY THAT HAS
REPUBLICANS UP IN MONTANA --
CLOSING THE GAP IN MONTANA, UP
IN NORTH DAKOTA, WEST VIRGINIA.
I THINK THE MESSAGE IS VERY
CLEAR.
DEMOCRATS, YOU MADE A MISTAKE
HERE AND IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP
IN NOVEMBER.
AND CERTAINLY WE HOPE THAT THEY
WILL COME OUT AND VOTE IN
SUPPORT OF BRETT KAVANAUGH OVER
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.
>> Bill: HAS ANYONE IN THE
WHITE HOUSE STAFF BEEN IN
CONTACT WITH SENATORS FLAKE,
MURCOWSKI AND COLLINS.
>> WE'RE CONTINUING TO STAY IN
CLOSE CONTACT WITH A NUMBER OF
SENATORS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO
WORKING WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE
WE GET THIS VOTE THROUGH.
>> Bill: WOULD YOU NAME ANY ONE
OF THOSE THREE AS SOMEONE YOU
ARE IN CONTACT WITH?
>> I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE
WHITE HOUSE IS CONTINUING TO
STAY IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE
SENATE.
>> Bill: WHAT ABOUT DEMOCRATIC
SENATORS HEITKAMP AND MANCHIN,
ARE THEY INCLUDED IN THAT?
>> WE'LL CONTINUE TALKING WITH
THOSE INDIVIDUALS AS WELL.
LOOK, I THINK ONE OF THE
BIGGEST AND MOST TELLING PARTS
OF THIS PROCESS IS ALL OF THE
DEMOCRATS THAT ARE COMING OUT
CLAIMING THAT THEY WANT TO SEE
MORE, THAT THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN
ENOUGH ARE DEMOCRATS THAT HAVE
ALREADY PLEDGED AND PROMISED TO
VOTE NO.
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY WANT MORE
INFORMATION.
IT'S A TOTAL SHAM AND THEY NEED
TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AND STOP
PLAYING POLITICS.
>> Sandra: THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
DOING THIS MORNING.
CHRIS COONS WAS ON "FOX &
FRIENDS" THE LAST PART OF THE
8:00 HOUR MAKING THAT CASE THAT
NOT ENOUGH WERE INTERVIEWED IN
THIS PROCESS AND DR. FORD'S
ATTORNEY HAS ISSUED A STATEMENT
ON HER BEHALF SAYING THIS ISN'T
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION
BECAUSE DR. FORD HERSELF WAS
NOT INTERVIEWED BY THE F.B.I.
IN THE SEVENTH INVESTIGATION.
WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT AND
WHITE HOUSE SAY BACK TO THAT?
>> I THINK IT'S SIMPLE.
I CAN'T GET INTO WHO WAS OR
WASN'T INTERVIEWED BUT I CAN
TELL YOU THE WHOLE WORLD
WATCHED AS DR. FORD WAS
INTERVIEWED FOR HOURS BY THE
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE TO MAKE
THE DECISION.
THAT'S THE SENATORS THEMSELVES.
THEY HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO
ASK ANY QUESTION THEY WANTED OF
DR. FORD.
IF THEY DIDN'T GET ENOUGH THAT
WAS THEIR OWN FAULT BECAUSE
THEY DIDN'T STEP UP TO THE
PLATE AND ASK THE QUESTIONS
THEY NEEDED ANSWER TO.
TO THINK THAT THE F.B.I. NEEDS
TO INTERVIEW HER AGAIN IS
LUDICROUS.
THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO
SO.
IF THEY DIDN'T GET TO ASK WHAT
THEY WANTED IT'S THEIR OWN
MISTAKE.
>> Bill: SANDRA WAS REFERENCING
THE COONS INTERVIEW EARLIER.
NUMBER THREE FROM EARLIER TODAY
WHERE HE PRETTY MUCH SUGGESTS
THAT KAVANAUGH WILL GO THROUGH.
HE SAID THIS.
>> I THINK THIS WILL BE A VERY
CLOSE VOTE.
IT HANGS BY A FEW UNDECIDED
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.
I HAVEN'T READ THIS REPORT YET.
IF I WERE TO JUST GUESS TODAY,
HE WILL BE NARROWLY CONFIRMED.
>> Bill: THAT'S FROM SENATOR
COONS NOW SIX DAYS LATER.
NOW, LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS IN
WASHINGTON THIS WEEK AND THE
PRESIDENT TOOK SOME HEAT FROM A
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA
ABOUT TALKING ABOUT DR. FORD AT
THAT RALLY THE OTHER NIGHT IN
MISSISSIPPI AND HE GOES TO
MINNESOTA LATER TODAY.
LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS ASKED ABOUT
THAT SPECIFICALLY YESTERDAY AND
THIS WAS HIS REACTION ON THAT
>> I'M THE FIRST PERSON TO SAY
I WANT TO HEAR FROM DR. FORD.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS HANDLED
RESPECTFULLY.
I THOUGHT KAVANAUGH WAS TREATED
LIKE CRAP.
YEAH, WELL BOO YOURSELFS.
>> THERE ARE THE BOO BIRDS FROM
HIS COMMENT THERE.
YOU TALK ABOUT THE SURGE IN
REPUBLICAN AND CONSERVATIVE
INTERESTS IN THE KAVANAUGH
NOMINATION AND YOU THINK ABOUT
THE CROWD'S REACTION THE OTHER
NIGHT IN MISSISSIPPI.
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING ON THE
INSIDE?
WHAT DO YOUR NUMBERS TELL YOU
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE NOW
ENGAGED IN THIS HEARING
PROBABLY IN A WAY THEY WERE NOT
PRIOR TO THE PAUSE LAST FRIDAY
AFTERNOON?
>> CERTAINLY I THINK YOU'VE
SEEN NUMBERS FROM ACROSS THE
COUNTRY AND ENERGY FROM
INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST
REASONS IS THE FAIRNESS AND THE
PROCESS AND THE POLITICS THAT
DEMOCRATS HAVE INJECTED INTO
THIS THAT WOULD TYPICALLY NEVER
BE PART OF A SUPREME COURT
NOMINEE'S HEARING PROCESS IS
WHAT THEY'VE DONE.
I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE
MOST OF THE OUTRAGE COMING FROM.
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT AREN'T
TYPICAL SUPPORTERS OF THE
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OUTSPOENG.
>> Bill: WAS IT A STRATEGY TO
CHARACTERIZE DR. FORD'S
TESTIMONY LIKE HE DID IN
MISSISSIPPI?
>> OUR STRATEGY IS SIMPLE FROM
DAY ONE.
OUR STRATEGY HAS BEEN REAL
SIMPLE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO
SEEING IT HAPPEN.
>> Bill: HE APPEARED TO BE
RESTRAINED UP TO THAT MOMENT.
WAS THERE A CONSCIOUS DECISION
MADE THAT YOU ARE CHARACTERIZE
DR. FORD'S TESTIMONY THE WAY HE
DID THE OTHER NIGHT BASED ON
THE NUMBERS YOU ARE SEEING AND
THE SUPPORT ACROSS THE COUNTRY?
>> LOOK, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE NUMBERS.
IT HAS TO DO SIMPLY WITH THE
PRESIDENT BEING THE LEADER AND
CERTAINLY WANTING TO SEE HIS
NOMINEE BE TREATED FAIRLY.
HE WANTS THIS PROCESS TO BE RUN
THE RIGHT WAY.
EVERY SINGLE WORD -- I SAID
THIS YESTERDAY, EVERY SINGLE
WORD THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS
SAID DURING HIS TESTIMONY WAS
PICKED APART RELENTLESSLY.
HE WAS BADGERED.
AS LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID HE WAS
NOT NECESSARILY TREATED FAIRLY.
HE THOUGHT HE WAS TREATED
HORRIBLY AND THE PRESIDENT
WANTED TO POINT OUT THE
HYPOCRISY OF THAT AND HE
POINTED TO THE FACTS WHAT TOOK
PLACE DURING THAT TESTIMONY AND
DURING THAT HEARING.
>> Sandra: SARAH, RIGHT NOW THE
EXPECTATION IS THAT THERE WOULD
BE A PROCEDURAL VOTE SOMETIME
TOMORROW WITH A CONFIRMATION
VOTE AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE
SATURDAY.
WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE
PREPARING FOR AS FAR AS A
TIMELINE?
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE SENATE
PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE TOP OF
THE NEXT HOUR.
>> RIGHT NOW OUR FOCUS IS
MAKING SURE WE GET HIM
CONFIRMED AND FIGURE OUT THE
LOGISTICS OF THE DETAILS AFTER
THAT TAKES PLACE.
