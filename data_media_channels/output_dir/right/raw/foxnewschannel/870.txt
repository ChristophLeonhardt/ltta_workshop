1
00:00:07,803 --> 00:00:11,573
>>  IT PROBABLY DIDN'T HELP, BUT

2
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:13,441
NOBODY WAKES UP IN THE CAMPAIGN

3
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:14,976
WORLD HOPING THEY'LL GET A TWEET

4
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:16,143
AGAINST THEM FROM THE PRESIDENT

5
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:16,845
OF THE UNITED STATES, BUT I

6
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:19,614
THINK IT BEGS THE LARGER

7
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:22,517
DYNAMICS PLAYED OUT IN THE RACE,

8
00:00:22,517 --> 00:00:23,652
ARE YOU FOR TRUMP OR NOT?

9
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:26,321
>> WELL, IT WASN'T QUITE THAT

10
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:27,322
SIMPLE.

11
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:31,326
MARK SANFORD DID LOSE ON AND THE

12
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:32,093
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

13
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:33,094
DID TWEET AGAINST HIM.

14
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:35,363
IT WASN'T CLOSE, HE LOST FAIRLY

15
00:00:35,363 --> 00:00:37,365
CLEARLY TO KATIE ARRINGTON WHO

16
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:39,334
JOINS US OUT OF CHARLESTON,

17
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:40,335
SOUTH CAROLINA, THE REPUBLICAN

18
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:42,003
CONGRESSIONAL NOMINEE FOR THAT

19
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:43,138
DISTRICT.

20
00:00:43,138 --> 00:00:44,472
MS. ARRINGTON, WELCOME TO YOU.

21
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:44,940
CONGRATULATIONS.

22
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,075
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, SIR.

23
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:48,310
AN HONOR TO BE ON THE SHOW

24
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,610
TODAY.

25
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,811
NEIL: WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF WHAT

26
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:53,215
HE WAS SAYING, THAT ESSENTIALLY

27
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:54,282
DONALD TRUMP LOST HIM THIS?

28
00:00:54,282 --> 00:00:59,354
>> YOU KNOW, AND WE ALL IN SOUTH

29
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:00,689
CAROLINA THANK MARK SANFORD FOR

30
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:05,760
THE PAST 24 YEARS OF IS SERVICE,

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,228
IT'S ENOUGH.

32
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:08,597
THIS IS NOT J US ABOUT THE TRUMP

33
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:08,964
FACTOR.

34
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:10,332
IT'S ABOUT A HARD-WORKING

35
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:12,601
CAMPAIGN AND HAD A LOT TO DO

36
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:14,469
WITH THE FACT SAYING NO

37
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:15,136
CONTINUOUSLY DOESN'T SOLVE

38
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:16,171
PROBLEMS, THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

39
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:18,206
SOMEBODY IN WASHINGTON WHO IS

40
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:21,676
GOING TO GET TO WORK TO GET THE

41
00:01:21,676 --> 00:01:24,079
PROBLEMS FIXED IN THIS NATION

42
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,147
AND IT'S DISHEARTENING TO SEE

43
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:27,749
HIM CONTINUE ON FOR THIS.

44
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:28,917
TRUMP HAS GONE SO FAR IN THE

45
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:31,353
PAST FEW DAYS, IT'S ENOUGH, STOP

46
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:31,653
NOW.

47
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:32,087
IT'S OKAY.

48
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:34,289
MOVE ON, WE'VE GOT BIGGER

49
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:34,623
ISSUES.

50
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:35,390
NEIL: WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT

51
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,959
IT, IS 90% OF THE TIME OR SO, HE

52
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:40,262
WAS ALIGNED WITH THE PRESIDENT.

53
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:43,465
AND I GUESS BECAUSE HE MADE A

54
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:45,133
DUSTUP ON AMONG OTHER ISSUES,

55
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:48,403
THE TRADE THING, THAT GOT THE

56
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:50,205
NOW, THERE MIGHT BE OTHER

57
00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:51,706
FACTORS, I WOULD IMAGINE THERE

58
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:53,842
WERE, BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF

59
00:01:53,842 --> 00:01:55,243
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE SERIOUS

60
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:56,444
ISSUES WITH THE PRESIDENT'S

61
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:58,513
TARIFFS, POLICY AND HOW THAT

62
00:01:58,513 --> 00:02:07,722
COULD BOOMERRANG.

63
00:02:07,722 --> 00:02:09,591
ARE YOU AFRAID IF YOU'RE ELECTED

64
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:10,491
TOWING THE TRUMP LINE.

65
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:13,194
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TRUMP

66
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:13,528
LINE.

67
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:16,031
MARK SANFORD WENT ON CNN HOW

68
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:17,732
MANY TIMES TO BASH THE PRESIDENT

69
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:19,200
AND HE MADE IT PERSONAL.

70
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,836
HE WAS VERY PERSONAL ABOUT THE

71
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:23,238
PRESIDENT AND ONE OF THE FEW

72
00:02:23,238 --> 00:02:26,274
REPUBLICANS TO GET UP AND BRING

73
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:28,310
UP THE STORMY DANIELS STORY.

74
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,345
AND BLAMED THE PRESIDENT FOR

75
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:32,180
STEVE SCALISE'S SHOOTING SAYING

76
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,815
HE WAS CULPABLE.

77
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:35,383
YOU CAN'T AGREE WITH EVERYONE,

78
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:37,552
THIS NATION IS FOUNDED ON DEBATE

79
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:38,687
AND CONVERSATION, BUT THE

80
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:40,522
PROBLEM WITH MARK SANFORD, HE

81
00:02:40,522 --> 00:02:41,990
CAN'T GET INTO A SEAT AT THE

82
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,058
TABLE WITH THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE

83
00:02:43,058 --> 00:02:44,526
HE'S BEEN SO OFFENSIVE.

84
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:45,860
IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A

85
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,228
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT POLICY, IT'S

86
00:02:47,228 --> 00:02:49,264
ANOTHER THING TO GO PERSONALLY

87
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:50,932
ATTACKING SOMEONE ON NATIONAL TV

88
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:51,933
TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

89
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:55,136
WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND THAT.

90
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:56,938
THE TARIFF ISSUES THAT WE'RE

91
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:58,373
TALKING ABOUT NOW, I WOULD HOPE

92
00:02:58,373 --> 00:02:59,774
THAT I COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION

93
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:00,942
WITH THE PRESIDENT, BUT, YOU

94
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:02,310
KNOW, AS A NATION, I THINK WE

95
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,280
NEED TO KIND OF TAKE A STEP AND

96
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,549
THINK, THIS IS THE WORLD'S BEST

97
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:07,983
NEGOTIATOR.

98
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:09,684
ALL THE THINGS THAT EVERYONE HAS

99
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:13,021
BEEN CATEGORICALLY TERRIFIED OF,

100
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:15,557
NORTH KOREA, HE'S GOING TO BRING

101
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:17,258
US TO NUCLEAR WAR.

102
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:19,060
HE'S MANAGED TO BRING US THIS,

103
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,229
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT HE'S

104
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:22,964
GOING TO DO IN THE NEXT FEW

105
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:23,832
WEEKS, BUT WHEN I GET TO

106
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:25,834
WASHINGTON I'D LIKE TO HAVE A

107
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,268
DISCUSSION, A RESPECTFUL

108
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:28,203
DISCUSSION WITH THE PRESIDENT.

109
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:29,237
NEIL: DO YOU AGREE WITH HIS

110
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:30,138
APPROACH ON TRADE?

111
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:32,273
>> RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, I COME

112
00:03:32,273 --> 00:03:34,242
FROM A COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS HELP

113
00:03:34,242 --> 00:03:35,577
WITH ITS STEEL AND ALUMINUM, SO,

114
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:37,245
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO LOOK OUT

115
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:39,247
FOR THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH

116
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:39,881
CAROLINA.

117
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:41,216
WE HAD A BRIDGE ACTUALLY

118
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:44,119
MALFUNCTION HERE, A BRIDGE

119
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:45,687
BREAK, THE CABLE SNAPPED AND

120
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,522
THANKFULLY WE HAD A COMPANY

121
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:49,057
RIGHT HERE, STANDARD TECH

122
00:03:49,057 --> 00:03:50,191
MANUFACTURING IN SUMMERVILLE

123
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:51,559
THAT WAS ABLE TO FIX IT BECAUSE

124
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:54,029
THEY HAVE THE STEEL ON SITE.

125
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:56,164
SO, I ABSOLUTELY AM GOING TO BE

126
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:57,032
ABOUT SOUTH CAROLINA FIRST, BUT

127
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:58,133
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

128
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,100
STATES HAS A GLOBAL VIEW.

129
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,402
I THINK THAT I WOULD NEED TO

130
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:03,104
SPEAK WITH HIM BEFORE I MADE ANY

131
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:03,805
DECISIONS ON THAT.

132
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:05,974
NEIL: NOW, IN THE RACE IN THE

133
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:07,675
FALL AND THINGS HAVE CHANGED AND

134
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:09,411
PROSPECTS HAVE IMPROVED FOR A

135
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:10,812
LOT OF REPUBLICANS, PERHAPS

136
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:12,580
YOURSELF INCLUDED, GIVEN THE

137
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,449
PICKUP IN THE ECONOMY AND

138
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:15,450
CERTAINLY PICKUP IN SOUTH

139
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,451
CAROLINA ECONOMY PARTICULARLY IN

140
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:18,920
YOUR VERY DISTRICT AND I'M

141
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,856
WONDERING IF THAT FADES OFF, IN,

142
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:24,392
YOU KNOW, SORT OF BLUE WAVE THAT

143
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:27,295
EVERYONE WAS PREDICTING OR THERE

144
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:29,464
WAS STILL ENOUGH FRUSTRATION

145
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:30,398
WITH THE PRESIDENT PERSONALLY

146
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:32,267
THAT IT WIPES OUT ALL OF THOSE

147
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:32,700
ADVANTAGES?

148
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,568
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

149
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:36,037
>> WELL, I CAN SAY THE BLUE WAVE

150
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:38,506
IS NOT GOING TO WASH ON THE

151
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:39,607
SHORES OF SOUTH CAROLINA.

152
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:41,576
OUR ECONOMY IS ROBUST.

153
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:43,111
WE HAVE MORE JOBS TO FILL THAN

154
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:44,913
WE HAVE PEOPLE TO FILL THEM, AND

155
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:46,247
ULTIMATELY, THOSE ARE THE THINGS

156
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:47,882
THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THE

157
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:50,485
VOTING BOOTH AND DECIDING AND

158
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:52,153
MAKING THEIR VOICE HEARD ON.

159
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:53,688
OUR NATION HAS NEVER BEEN

160
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:54,189
STRONGER.

161
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:55,457
RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.

162
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:57,392
WE HAVE A BOOMING ECONOMY AND AS

163
00:04:57,392 --> 00:04:59,394
FAR AS GLOBAL PEACE, WE'RE ON

164
00:04:59,394 --> 00:05:00,261
THE VERGE OF SOMETHING WE

165
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:01,996
HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE, YOU KNOW,

166
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:02,597
WORLD WAR II.

167
00:05:02,597 --> 00:05:03,932
LET'S TAKE A MINUTE AND THINK

168
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:05,266
ABOUT THE GOODNESS THAT'S COMING

169
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:07,769
OUT OF THIS AND I THINK THAT

170
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:10,105
SOUTH CAROLINA WAS VERY VOCAL IN

171
00:05:10,105 --> 00:05:12,273
THAT, IN THIS LAST PRIMARY

172
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:13,675
SEASON AND I THINK THAT WILL

173
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:14,442
CONTINUE INTO NOVEMBER.

174
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:15,376
NEIL: DO YOU WANT THE PRESIDENT

175
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:17,812
TO CAMPAIGN FOR YOU AS HE

176
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:18,546
INDICATED HE WILL?

177
00:05:18,546 --> 00:05:20,882
>> RIGHT NOW I AM JUST GOING ON

178
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:22,717
THE HARD WORK OF THIS CAMPAIGN.

179
00:05:22,717 --> 00:05:23,985
I APPRECIATE THE PRESIDENT'S

180
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:24,986
TWEET THE DAY OF.

181
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:26,254
IT WAS 4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.

182
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:28,590
A LOT OF THE VOTERS HAD ALREADY

183
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,391
GONE TO THE POLLS, BUT THIS

184
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:32,093
CAMPAIGN, YOU KNOW, TO MARK

185
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:34,529
SANFORD, SIR, THIS WAS A

186
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:35,897
HARD-FOUGHT, HARD-WON CAMPAIGN.

187
00:05:35,897 --> 00:05:37,365
WE KNOCKED ON THOUSANDS OF

188
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:38,633
