can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine we're shooting this and</font>

16
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,940
people are sitting in their seats

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,610
watching it this thing could be a

Harrelson was thrown in jail upon

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,890
causing a ruckus in a taxi starting a

23
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,510
car chase and then trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flee from</font>

24
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,030
police on foot really it was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

25
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,789
worst nights that I've had I don't know

26
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,780
why they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> comic how did you even</font>

27
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,060

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,380
they read the script and they really

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,540
liked it and they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a part of</font>

33
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,170
it with 14 locations 30 actors and a

<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred minutes shot on a single camera</font>

35
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,270

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,590
then live stream the entire film to

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,140
cinemas in one take even if the sound

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,990
doesn't get messed up or the live feed

42
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,390
doesn't go out or is it raining of the

43
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,479

<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I mean I haven't had a good</font>

50
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,310
night's sleep in a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stakes</font>

51
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,469
are high for harrelson and in a promo

52
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:05,759
for the project he's promised it of

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,829
think you're irretrievably wrong you'll

54
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,899
make a shame known publicly and if I

55
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:10,929
fail

56
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:13,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to jump off waterloo bridge</font>

57
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:16,840
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pins below so if this does fail</font>

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,060
Caray so everything's gone wrong and it

61
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,659
will be bad if everything is gone pretty

62
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,819
much right even with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few accidents</font>

63
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,150
from in and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can roll with them and</font>

64
00:02:34,150 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider that a success</font>
