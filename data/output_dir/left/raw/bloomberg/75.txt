1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,160
In the world of professional wrestling, there's
something called a "Swerve."

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,680
ANNOUNCER: "HULK HOGAN HAS BETRAYED WCW!"

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,280
Some examples: These tag team partners are
called "Baby-faces", or the good guys.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,460
Then one of them swerves, when he super-kicks
his tag-team partner in the head, quickly

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,860
assuming the role of the bad guy, or what
the wrestling world calls the "heel".

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,180
ANNOUNCER: "ARE YOU KIDDING?

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,560
WHAT A DISPICABLE ACT THAT WAS!"

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,259
Or a match is almost lost, when… what's
that?

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,220
The superstar wrestler appears out of nowhere
sprinting down the aisle to save the match.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,380
ANNOUNCER: "THAT'S THE WARRIOR'S MUSIC!

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,620
IT'S THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR!"

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,800
That's a swerve.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,280
So it should go as no surprise that World
Wrestling Entertainment, known as the WWE,

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,820
the most popular brand of sports entertainment
in the world is prepared for any swerves that

15
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:48,870
come their way.

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:58,590
So here's the story of how the WWE learned
to see the swerve coming.

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,840
So I spoke to Bloomberg reporters Felix Gillette...

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,320
Gillette: I'm a writer for Bloomberg News
for the global business team.

19
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:05,328
and Kim Bhasin

20
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:08,259
Bhasin: And I'm the U.S. luxury reporter at
Bloomberg.

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,680
To find out exactly how the WWE is positioning
itself for an all-out global invasion.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,380
Which starts with a massive change to their
lucrative pay-per-view model.

23
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,600
Gillette: WWE basically pioneered the pay-per-view
model on cable.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,280
I remember as a kid when the pay-per-view
events came up all of our friends would scramble

25
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,390
around and try and get one of the parents
to, to pay for it.

26
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,220
But in 2014, they took a HUGE risk.

27
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:39,830
Gillette: They saw a little bit sooner than
some of the other entertainment brands that

28
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:47,409
where this whole thing was moving was away
from cable and satellite television, and towards

29
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,100
on demand streaming video apps.

30
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,369
Gillette: They made this risky decision in
essence cannibalizing that pay-per-view model,

31
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:55,770
which they had essentially built.

32
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,259
And after some early turbulence it's working.

33
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,120
Roughly 1.5 million people are paying a $9.99
a month

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,450
for the WWE app, making it the fifth-most
popular streaming OTT service.

35
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,160
This "adapt or die" approach is in the WWE's
DNA.

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,180
Over the past 30 years the company always
seems to think two steps ahead.

37
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,360
In the early 90s…

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,800
Bhasin: WWE was at its most threatened when
Ted Turner took them on with WCW

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,960
Which stands for World Championship Wrestling.

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,900
And back then, the WCW was winning the ratings
war.

41
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,580
So in order to compete with them…

42
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,320
Bhasin: WWE had changed its product from a
family-friendly

43
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,420
kind of cartoonish style to this really raw,

44
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,140
that's why they called their show RAW.

45
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,160
It was this raw style of wrestling.

46
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,180
with violent, outrageous reality inspired
plotlines and aggressive personas.

47
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,760
ANNOUNCER: "FROM A 16 FOOT LADDER!"

48
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,040
Bhasin: And they won that fight against Ted
Turner.

49
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,520
And they bought WCW.

50
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,880
The early 2000s ushered in an era of testosterone-driven
programming aimed at

51
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,800
the red-blooded American male…

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,580
Bhasin: Bra and panties matches and people
smashing each other over the head with like

53
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,909
barbed wire bats and things like that.

54
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:17,590
Until 2015 when WWE fans started a hashtag
#GiveDivasAChance.

55
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,940
Since then, WWE hired 40 more female wrestlers.

56
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,510
And that growing cast of female characters
was part of a much larger plan.

57
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,470
Bhasin: They started to try to appeal to a
broader set of people.

58
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,240
Gillette: Let's attract more female fans.

59
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,260
And after we've attracted more female fans,
let's attract more international fans

60
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,460
They're broadening their base and
they're doing that in large part to make it

61
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,060
more advertiser friendly.

62
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,380
And not just friendly to advertisers…

63
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,640
Gillette: They're trying to build up their
fan base in China, they're trying to build

64
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,360
up their fan base in Europe, they you know
already have a pretty good fan base in India.

65
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,959
Bhasin: India is a place where they already
have an established wrestling culture.

66
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,890
Because of the gigantic Indian wrestler The
Great Kali.

67
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,120
But there's still a lot of work to do.

68
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,720
While the WWE set a revenue record in 2017,
only 30% of it is coming from overseas audience.

69
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,600
And there's one person whose responsibility
is to grow that number.

70
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Bhasin: The buck eventually stops at Vince
McMahon no matter what's happening within

71
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,610
WWE.

72
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,670
Gillette: Yeah, he's a very controlling guy,
and it's a very, very, very tightly scripted

73
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,670
company.

74
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:30,500
Bhasin: And that goes down the board to big
stars' entrance music,

75
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,780
and their outfits and things like that.

76
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,170
So with a CEO like McMahon always planning
two moves ahead

77
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:41,300
and an aggressive push into multiple international
markets, a big issue... is money.

78
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,760
Gillette: It's hard to do all those things
simultaneously without committing a huge amount

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
of capital to it.

80
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,560
And that's where the WWE becomes an attractive
company for buyers.

81
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,860
Gillette: Potentially one thing that could
happen with WWE is they could benefit by being

82
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,720
acquired by a bigger technology or telecom
company.

83
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,280
An Amazon, or a Facebook, or a 21st Century
Fox.

84
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,650
So with a market cap of $2.8 billion, the
advantage of owning 100% of their own content,

85
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,860
and a rapid consolidation spreading throughout
the entertainment industry, it looks like

86
00:05:13,860 --> 00:00:00,000
the WWE is well positioned, even if there are
swerves ahead.
