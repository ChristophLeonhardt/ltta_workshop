the world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate very much to leave it when Ernest Hemingway's Robert Jordan at the close for Whom the Bell Tolls lies wounded and waiting for his last fight these are among his final thoughts my father had every reason to think the world was an awful place my father had every reason to think the world was not worth fighting for my father had every reason to think the world was worth leaving he did not think any of those things like the hero of his favorite book John McCain took the opposite view you had to have a lot of luck to have had such a good life I am here before you today saying the words I have never wanted to say giving this speech I have never wanted to give feeling the loss I have never wanted to feel my father is gone John Sydney McCain the third was many things he was a sailor he was an aviator he was a husband he was a warrior he was a prisoner he was a hero he was a congressman he was a senator he was a nominee for president of the United States these are all the titles and the roles of a life that has been well lived they are not the greatest of his titles nor the most important of his roles he was a great man we gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness the real thing not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served he was a great fire who burned bright in a past few days my family and I have heard from so many of those Americans who stood in the warmth and light of his fire found it illuminated what is best about them we are grateful to them because they are grateful to him if you have resented that fire for that light it cast upon them for the truth it revealed about their character but my father never cared what they thought and even that small numbers still have the opportunity as long as they draw breath to live up to the example of John McCain my father was a great man he was a great warrior he was a great American I admired him for all of these things but I loved him because he was a great father my father knew what it was like to grow up in the shadow of greatness he did just as his father had done before him she was the son of a great Admiral who was also the son of a great Admiral and when it came time for the third John Sidney McCain to become a man he had no choice but in his own eyes walk in those exact same paths he had to become a sailor he had to go to war he had to have his shot at becoming a great admiral as they also had done in the past of his father and grandfather led my father directly to the harrowing hell of the Hanoi Hilton this is the public legend that is John McCain this is where all the biography is the campaign literature and public remembrances say he showed his character his patriotism his faith and his endurance in the worst of possible circumstances this is where we learned who John McCain truly was and all of that is very true except for the last part today I want to share with you where I found out what John McCain truly was it wasn't in the Hanoi Hilton it wasn't in the cockpit of a fast and lethal fighter jet it wasn't on the high seas or on the campaign trail John McCain was in all of those places but the best of him was somewhere else the best of John McCain the greatest of his titles and the most important of his roles was as a father imagine the warrior the knight of the skies gently carrying his little girl to bed imagine the dashing aviator who took his aircraft hurtling off pitching decks in the South China Seas kissing the hurt when I fell in skinned my knee imagine the distinguished statesman who counseled presidents and the powerful singing with his little girl in oak creek during a rainstorm - singing in the rain imagine the senator the fierce conscience of the nation's best self taking his 14 year old daughter out of school because he believed that I would learn more about America at the town halls he held across the country imagine the elderly veteran of war in government whose wisdom and courage were sought by the most distinguished men of our time with his eyes shining with happiness as he gave his blessing for his grown daughter's marriage you all have to imagine that I don't have to because I lived it all I know who he was I know what to find him I got to see it every single day of my blessed life John McCain was not defined by prison by the Navy by the Senate by the Republican Party or by any single one of the deeds in his absolutely extraordinary life John McCain is defined by love several of you out there in the pews who cross swords with him or found yourselves on the receiving end of his famous temper or were at a cross purposes to him on nearly anything all right at this moment doing your best to stay stone Faced don't you know full well that if John McCain were in your shoes here today he'd be using some salty word he learned in the Navy while my mother jabbed him in the arm and embarrassment he looked back at her and grumble and maybe stock stopped talking but he would keep grinning she was the only one who could do that on their first date when he still did not know what sort of woman she was he recited a Robert service poem to her called the cremation of Sam McGee about an Alaskan prospector who welcomes his cremation as the only way to get warm in the icy north there are strange things done in the Midnight Sun by the men who moil for gold the Arctic trails have their secret tales that would make your blood run cold he had learned it in Hawaii a prisoner in the next cell had wrapped it out in code over and over again during the long years of captivity my father figure that if Cindy Lou Hensley would sit through that and appreciate the dark humor that had seen him through so many years of cool imprisonment she just might sit through a lifetime with him as well and she did John McCain was defined by love this love of my father for my mother was the most fierce and lasting of them all mom let me tell you what love meant to John McCain and to me his love was the love of a father who mentors as much as he comforts he was endlessly present for us and though we did not always understand it he was always teaching he didn't expect us to be like him his ambitions for us unmoored from any world the achievement was to be better than him armed with his wisdom and informed by his experiences long before we were even old enough to have assembled our own as a girl I did not fully appreciate what I most fully appreciate now how he suffered and how he bore it with his stoic silence that was once the mark of an American man I came to appreciate it first when he demanded I was a small girl thrown from a horse and crying from a busted collarbone my dad picked me up he took me to the doctor and he got me all fixed up then he immediately took me back home and made me get back on that very same horse I was furious at him as a child but how I loved him for it now my father knew pain and suffering with an intimacy and immediacy that most of us are blessed never to have endured he was shot down he was crippled he was beaten he was starved he was tortured and he was humiliated that pain never left him the cruelty of his communist captors ensured that he would never raise his firearms above his head for the rest of his life yet he survived yet he endured yet he triumphed and there was this man who had been through all that with a little girl who simply didn't want to get back on her horse he could have sat me down and told me all of that and made me feel small because my complaint and my fear was nothing next to his pain and memory instead he made me feel loved Megan he said his quiet voice that spoke with authority and menu hit best obey get back on the horse it did because I was a little girl I resented it now that I am a woman I look back across that time and see the expression on his face when I climb back up and rode again and I see the pride and love in his eyes as he said nothing is going to break you the rest of my life whenever I fall down I'd get back up whenever I am hurt I Drive on whenever I am brought low I rise that is not because I am uniquely virtuous or strong or resilient it is simply because my father John McCain was when my father got sick then I asked him what he wanted me to do with this eulogy he said show them how tough you are that is what love meant to John McCain love for my father also meant caring for the nation and trusted to him my father the true son of his father and grandfather was born into an enduring sense of the heart one character of American greatness and was convinced at the need to defend it with ferocity and faith John McCain was born in a distant and now vanquished outpost of American power and he understood America as a sacred trust he understood our public demands responsibilities even before it defends its rights he knew navigating the line between good and evil was often difficult but always simple he grasped that our purpose and our meaning was rooted in a missionaries responsibility stretching back centuries just as the first Americans looked upon a new world full of potential for a grand experiment in freedom and self-government so their descendants have a responsibility to defend the old world from its worst self the America of John McCain is the America of the revolution fighters with no stomach for the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot making the world anew with the bells of Liberty the America of John McCain is the America of Abraham Lincoln fulfilling the promise of the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal in suffering greatly to see it through the America of John McCain is the America of the boys who rushed the colors in every war across three centuries knowing that in them is the life of the Republic and particularly those by their daring as Ronald Reagan said gave up their chance at being husbands and fathers and grandfathers and gave up their chance to be revered old men the America of John McCain is yes the America of Vietnam fighting the fight even in the most forlorn cause even in the scrimm circumstances even in the most distant and hostile corner of the world standing even defeat for the life and liberty of other peoples in other lands the america of john mccain is generous and welcoming and bold she is resourceful and confident and secure she meets her responsibilities she speaks quietly because she is strong America does not boast because she has no need to the America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great that fervent faith that proven devotion that abiding love that is what drove my father from the fiery skies above the Red River Delta to the brink of the presidency itself love to find my father as a young man he wondered if he would measure up to his distinguished lineage I miss him so badly I want to tell him that he did but I take small comfort in this somewhere in the great beyond where the Warriors go there are two Admirals of the United States meeting their much-loved son they are telling him he is the greatest among them dad I love you I always have all that I am all that I hope all that I dream is grounded in what you taught me you loved me and you showed me what love must be an ancient Greek historian wrote that the image of great men is woven into the stuff of other men's lives - had your greatness is woven into my life it is woven into my mother's life it is woven into my sister's life and it is woven into my brother's lives it is woven into the lit life and liberty of the country you sacrificed so much to defend dad I know you were not perfect we live in an era where we knock down old American heroes for all their imperfections when no leader wants to admit to fault or failure you were an exception and you gave us an ideal to strive for look I know you can see this gathering here in this Cathedral the nation is here to remember you like so many other heroes you leave us draped in the flag you loved you defended it you sacrificed it you have always honored it it is good to remember but we are Americans we don't put our heroes on pedestals just to remember them we raise them up because we want to emulate their virtues this is how we honor them and this is how we will honor you my father is gone my father is gone and my sorrow is immense but I know his life and I know it was great because it was good and as much as I hate to see him go I do know how it ended I know on the afternoon of August 25th in front of Oak Creek in Cornville Arizona surrounded by the family he loved so much an old man shook off the scars of battle one last time and a rose a new man to pilot one last flight up and up and up busting clouds left and right straight on through to the kingdom of heaven and he slipped the earthly bonds put out his hand and touched the face of God I love you dad hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to
