in this episode I will spoil Star Wars it's just for Malthus my producer I'm not actually gonna do that but net neutrality has come to an end which means that Armageddon is upon us all the children will die the seals will wither in the Sun all of the terrible things will happen or maybe not I will explain I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show it's a Friday so we're all in a good mood here around the office and hence the the last Jedi reference I've not seen it so I can't spoil anything about last Jedi except I do know that Luke's mechanical hand from Return of the Jedi has now been replaced with a flipper like a dolphin flipper that's that's what I know about the movie so if the spoiler alert he has a flipper for a hand okay but in other news net neutrality has come to an igneous end and everyone is losing their mind we're all going to die captain dogs will live together the world will burst into flame you'll have to choose between your two firstborn children as to which one will be sacrificed to AOL and which one will be sacrificed to Verizon you will have to make these decisions at least this is what we've learned in the last 24 hours after a set of regulations that really didn't end up doing much well it's just abolished by the FCC we'll get to all of that but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Birch gold so right now does it

yesterday because net neutrality was repealed whoo now here's the truth I've talked about net neutrality here on the program a little bit I was not in favor of net neutrality I didn't interview with a chip I the head of the FCC the guy who is most responsible for getting rid of net neutrality and I think his answers were relatively good there are decent arguments on both sides from net neutrality there really are I'm gonna try and be as objective as possible about this and lay out the argument for one side and then lay out the argument for the other side and then tell you why I come down on the side that I come down basically here's how it works you order your internet from Verizon Verizon is an internet service provider Netflix buys data from Verizon so that Netflix can actually be on the internet and then you pay so that you have access to Netflix right this is all common sense this is how the internet works well Verizon isn't as an ISP or or Sprint's as an ISP is Sprint's and I speak Comcast is an ISP and some of that some of these ISPs they compete with one another and one of the things that they want to do is they want the ability to privilege certain content above other content when it comes to charging them the reason for this is that basically right now Netflix for example takes up an enormous amount of bandwidth for whatever ISP it is it is working with and that drives up the price for bandwidth for smaller providers so it is quite possible than an ISP may launch that wants to charge Netflix more per byte of data and therefore drive the price down for the other people who are using the Internet right or it's possible that the ISP may say to Netflix listen you want to load faster than other sites you can pay us a premium all of this is fine right I don't see a huge problem with any of this the only problem with any of this is if there is a monopoly or oligopoly and here's the argument in favor of net neutrality so let's say that you only have one internet service provider in your area the reason that you probably only have one internet service provider in your area is because a lot of local government regulations make it difficult to build an ISP in order to lay down broadband you actually have to have government rights of way and a lot of local governments will put conditions on the various companies that want to come in so that creates a sort of oligopoly situation the idea here is let's say that there's Comcast and Comcast owns Netflix so let's just say they bought Netflix and they want to help Netflix but they want to hurt Hulu so they slowed down artificially the speed on Hulu encouraging people to subscribe to Netflix instead of subscribing to Hulu right this is the great fear that Comcast is basically gonna strangle in the crib competition - it's vertically integrated companies and this is not an idle worry in a monopoly situation you theoretically could do this so the anti net neutrality people will say listen we already have anti competition regulations in place right you can actually prosecute monopolies that are acting as monopolies the FTC the Federal Trade Commission can crackdown the FCC can crackdown on this you don't need to basically mandate that all traffic be treated the same or be charged the same because again maybe you want to charge your Netflix more because it's taking up more bandwidth maybe you want to charge the pornography company that's taking up an enormous amount of bandwidth on your computer more maybe you want to do all of those things so everybody who is in favor of net neutrality says well the ISPs shouldn't be allowed to do that when you buy an internet uplink then you should basically get all the pages at the same rate and for a given price but the truth is that you're actually redistributing cost right let's say that my grandmother doesn't use Netflix well her internet price the price that Comcast is charging for her is actually going to be higher than normally would be if for example they could divide out Netflix and have you pay a subscription fee for a faster internet service against Netflix faster and she's actually subsidizing me because I'm using Netflix and she isn't she doesn't have to use very much data I have to use more data and there's a sort of free distributive mechanism that happens so these are the two arguments one is that Olga Polly means that the government has to come in and regulate the ISPs they don't strangle Netflix or YouTube or any other any other outlet that they want to strangle and people against net neutrality say well if you actually want to foster competition in the ISP space if you want a proper distribution of cost then you actually need to let competition take over now in order for competition to take over it's not enough for the federal government just to get rid of net neutrality the federal government also needs to encourage all of these companies to start investing in local areas and local governments need to start encouraging all the ISPs to invest in building new broadband networks okay so those are the arguments the reason I come down against net neutrality is because I don't think that the the answer to oligopoly is more oligopoly once you enshrine the idea and create barriers to entry that every piece of data has to be treated the same then what is the comparative advantage of a small start-up company as opposed to Comcast the answer is none but it can be very difficult for them to compete in that market that is why you see all of these small ISPs actually in favor of getting rid of net neutrality the companies you see in favor of keeping that neutrality our companies like Netflix they don't want to pay more for that fast tolling on the Internet highway okay now here's the truth no matter what happened with net neutrality the internet was not going to be radically different it was not going to radically change because of Comcast were to start strangling hulu in its crib there would be competitive ramifications for that in the marketplace people would start out to start opting for Verizon instead of Comcast there would be an effort by smaller ISPs to get in the market competition would become a thing and it's very interesting to me that a lot of the same people who are deeply concerned with big corporations like Comcast strangling various companies they don't like aren't seemingly unconcerned about Facebook or YouTube or Twitter strangling political positions they don't like right Twitter routinely knocks people off line for things that Twitter doesn't like YouTube will D monetize videos they don't like my friends at places like ladder with Crowder and Dave Rubin they've been demonetized Prager University have been too monetized by YouTube I don't see the same people who are complaining about net neutrality complaining the YouTube is not treating all content the same and they're all in favor of all content be treating the same being treated the same when it comes to their favorite outlets but when it comes to their favorite political views they have nothing to say I'm pretty consistent on this I think YouTube has the right to crackdown on videos it doesn't like they have the right to do it they're wrong to do it but they have the right to do it and I think ISPs have the right to do it similarly I think competition in the marketplace keeps a lot of these companies honest okay so with all of that said there's this weird idea that was going around that the end of the internet was gonna happen yesterday CNN actually headlined end of the Internet and yet strangely their article appeared on the Internet after this after all of this had happened right but the level of outrage and insanity was so high so I want to show you some of these tweets and some of them are totally crazy this one is from GLAAD the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation they literally tweeted the repeal of net neutrality is an attack on the LGBTQ community okay so number one anytime GLAAD headlines anything you could just get rid of the first four words and simple and put any other four words in there Republican tax cuts are an attack on the LGBT community dog catchers are an attack on the LGBTQ community if you think that net neutrality is a specific and attack on on gay people I don't know it's tell you there are lots of straight people who use the internet gang and that seems like a bit of a stretch to me Banksy whose most well known for basically graffitiing other people's property he tweeted this nonsense out Twitter $14.99 a month snapchat nine ninety-nine a month YouTube 1990 and a month Netflix $9.99 per movie Google $1.99 per search if you don't want to pay extra for your favorite sites you need to be supporting net neutrality this is incoherent okay its incoherent you know why netflix can't charge $14.99 a month cuz no one will pay 15 bucks for Twitter okay you know why Twitter can't charge that cuz no one will pay that money for Twitter no one on earth you know why Netflix can't charge $9.99 a movie because no one's gonna pay $9.99 a movie for the stuff that's on Netflix it's not going to happen because there's a thing called Amazon right this this whole idea that that Google is gonna charge $1.99 per search well if they want to make Bing the biggest thing on planet Earth they could do that I suppose but this makes it makes no sense at all it's absolute utter horse crap but this is the sort of alarmism that you saw on the internet yesterday we're all gonna die you're gonna have to sacrifice your dog to the gods of Twitter if you want to maintain your Twitter account chuck schumer tweeted out if net neutrality is eliminated the internet may start to resemble a toll road but the highest bidder is cruising along private fast lanes while the rest of us an inch along the single traffic took public Lane number one Chuck Schumer is the senator from New York New York is a lot of toll roads they work really well toll roads are actually kind of great one of the reasons toll roads exist is because number one they actually clear out a lane okay toll road to actually relieve traffic on the rest of the lane usually a toll road is added to it is not subtracted from usually don't just take one of the lanes of the highway and call it a toll road usually you build an extra Lane and then that's a toll road and so all of that money goes toward upkeep on the highway and if you want to pay for the toll road then you get a fast lane if that were really true then toll roads on the internet we're fine Netflix would pay a little bit more for their internet speed you might pay a little bit more if you use netflix a lot and you pay a little bit less if you use netflix a lot which seems fair to me frankly if you don't understand how this works think about bundled cable basically net neutrality is bundled cable you have to pay one price for everything and if you get rid of net neutrality even according to the worst case you know scenario people but the idea here would be they get to pick and choose which is PDUs based on the services that it provides number one I don't think that's actually gonna happen but even if it did happen I'm not sure that it's the end of the world well I did in that the alarmism didn't stop there Bernie Sanders did the same thing he said net neutrality is gonna be the end of the world first of all the last time Bernie Sanders use the interwebs was 1997 he used a dial-up AOL modem Bernie Sanders I'm not sure knows what a computer is yeah but here is Bernie Sanders the socialist talking about why net neutrality matters despite the fact that the Internet is the greatest the greatest and freest and most open market in the history of mankind and he opposes open markets here here's Bernie Sanders a disastrous decision it impact every American it will give huge advantages to big corporations of the small businesses the big media companies over smaller media outlets we've got to do everything we can to defeat this thing in the courts and defeated legislatively okay so the other time I going to the courts first of all Democrats can't go to the courts okay administrative decisions like this are not appealable if Bernie Sanders wants net neutrality he can damn well push for it in Congress which by the way is where it should have been pushed for in the first place this is not a regulatory decision regulating the internet like like the DWP under title 2 regulating it like a telephone company under the under the title 2 makes no sense legally if you want to do this do it through Congress in a second I'm going to explain I mean I'm gonna let really add your PI the head of the FCC explain why it is that that net neutrality is a bad idea but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at filter by comm so you don't think very much about the filters the air filters in your

so yesterday or the day before I had the chance to speak with a Jap I adjure pie is the head of the FCC and he explained to me I asked him specifically about the big question if there's an Oleg Appa Lee right if there's only one Internet service provider in your area then shouldn't net neutrality be a thing right shouldn't we force that oligopoly to treat all Internet traffic the same so it can't strangle off Hulu or Netflix or YouTube or whichever app it wants to in favor of its own content here was a Jap I explaining two different points number one I agree that we need more competition and that's why over the last 11 months that I've been in office as the chairman of the FCC we've undertaken a number of initiatives to promote a lot more competition getting more wireless spectrum out there for wireless carriers to use making it easier for smaller fiber providers to enter the marketplace getting the next generation of satellite companies into the marketplace to provide an alternative to the terrestrial folks so we're promoting more competition that way number two ironically these heavy-handed internet regulations imposed by the FCC in 2015 take us in the opposite direction they make it a harder it's already hard as it is for a lot of these smaller internet service providers to build a business case for deploying Internet infrastructure especially in rural and low-income urban areas these regulations make it even harder the last week alone I've spoken to small Internet service providers that nobody has ever heard of from Minnesota Montana who said that these regulations make it harder to raise capital to build a business case for deployment and actually spend the money in the time and the statistic that a GOP really cites here and the one that makes the most sense we can stop him there well what makes the most sense he's talked about this he says that among our nation's 12 largest Internet service providers domestic broadband capital expenditures decreased by five point six percent or three point six billion dollars between 2014 and 2016 the first two years of the title to era the point being that as soon as Net Neutrality hit all of the ISPs basically assumed that all the competition was wiped out the major ISPs assumed that there is no reason for them to spend any more because new regulations would be coming down the pike forcing them to spend and so they stopped spending on broadband they stopped doing upkeep on their broadband and making it faster and making it better a free market makes competition better he explained yesterday and as this thing was repealed 3-2 he explained his net neutrality decision and again everyone went not something he's been hit with an enormous number of death threats over this whole thing returning to the legal framework that governed the internet from President Clinton's pronouncement in 1996 until 2015 is not going to destroy the Internet it is not going to end the Internet as we know it it is not going to kill democracy it is not going to stifle free expression online if stating these propositions alone doesn't demonstrate their absurdity or Internet experience before 2015 and our Internet experience tomorrow once this order passes we'll prove them so simply put by returning to the light-touch title one framework we are helping consumers and promoting competition broadband providers will have stronger incentives to build networks especially in unserved areas and to upgrade networks to gigabit speeds and 5g this means there will be more competition among broadband providers it also means more ways that startups and tech giants alike can deliver applications and content to more users and short is a freer and more open Internet okay so you know this is the case that he's making people make the opposite case but one thing that is clear is though it's not going to destroy the internet and so CNN's crazed headlines about this and the Democrats craze talk about this it's a wild exaggeration how a regulatory issue that had very little impact on how the internet actually worked between 2015 and 2017 how that became at Lyford that scenario just demonstrates the level of hysteria for people who really don't understand what the issue is even on the most basic level I'm not an expert on that neutrality I don't pretend to be an expert on net neutrality but the basic issue is not about the destruction of the Internet as we know it yeah it's just patently insane but Jimmy Kimmel went off on it and and here here he is I mean Jimmy Kimmel first of all I feel like every time Jimmy Kimmel speaks politics now he should be morally obligated to bring out his baby tried out his child since he obviously makes emotional appeals on every he should what he really should if he's not gonna bring out his own kid to talk health care what he really should do should bring out a poor homeless virgin street urchin who will no longer be able to access internet at the public library for purposes of pornography and he should just drape his arm around him and then he should say this poor child will no longer have internet because of net neutrality he basically did that last night just without the poor street urchin again I don't know what qualifies Jimmy Kimmel to talk about these things and I'm happy for Jimmy Kimmel to you know have a debate with somebody who knows about it but Jimmy Kimmel doesn't want to do any of those things he just wants to read Chuck Schumer agitprop so here he is the FCC did something absolutely despicable today devoted to put an end to net neutrality and this is the rule that says everyone gets equal access to the Internet a big company or somebody selling crocheted owls from their house in the Midwest now as long as they tell us they're doing it now internet service providers will be allowed to slow down or block web traffic to any website or streaming service they like which benefits the big telecom companies and does the opposite for all of us but I just wanna say thank you president Trump thanks to you and this jackhole you were appointed to run the FCC he's the jackal it's funny it's like comedy it's like he's he's a jackhole so it's comedy now it's not just political is it cuz he said Jack Hall get it huh I love Jimmy Kimmel speaking on behalf of ABC Disney the biggest corporation in on planet earth right I mean he's on ABC Disney just bought Fox Fox 21st century right they just bought it okay outright Disney is an enormous corporation and here is Jimmy Kimmel talking on ABC's airwaves on what is basically an oligopoly right ABC was allowed to dominate the airwaves because it was one of three networks for most of his history and here he is talking about all those corporations they're gonna be controlling everything those big corporations cuz you know who doesn't know anything about big corporations is Jimmy Kimmel right and I love when he says that like grandma and her crochet website that's the one that's gonna pay the price for a net neutrality being being done away with the whole point is that Netflix Google YouTube oppose it not grandma with a crochet website no one cares about grandmas crochet website you'd think that you think that Verizon sitting around uh-huh now we got grandma in the cross hairs we're gonna make her pay up and she wants her crochet website up there I got a double her price what absolute sheer nonsense I know what he's saying doesn't even make any sense and it neglects the fact that there are big corporations on both side of this like we're gonna have a giant fight Dave Burge Iowa Hawk had a great tweet on this he basically said I never thought that the end of the world was gonna come over the people who actually provide the content to social media arguing over who should benefit from their content provision the ISPs or the order companies like Facebook that's really what it is like the cows are arguing over who should benefit more over their provision of the milk the grocery store the farmer but that's really all this happening here but it's just it's insipid and and the level of ire is totally crazy and P again people don't know about it like Jimmy Kimmel doesn't know Dee's talking about here again I'm not an expert I know more than Jimmy Kimmel an MSNBC anchor tried to do the same thing to a former FCC Chairman a former FCC chairman basically just stomped on him that's what one of the arguments for people in favor of removing net neutrality is that consumers will get more choice in the plans that they can buy why would they get more choice in plans if someone's not either subsidizing or able to be excluded from a particular plan why would I be able to drop what I pay on a monthly basis for internet if I'm not gonna lose something for it well let's rewind the tape a little bit which is okay so you're talking about consumers and entrepreneurs and discrimination in favor of your own product like a Comcast Pro no that's not what I'm talking about I think we need to rewind and have this conversation again at some point because you're making an argument that I'm not making I'm saying okay that if someone has an advantage in streaming their content over the internet an established player has an advantage because they've got the money to be able to buy better faster quicker access or prevent somebody else from getting it that the the incumbent is is favored over the startup that's the only point I wanted to make that's the only want to be illegal that's the point I'm making what you just said is already illegal it has been for a long time and we'll be going forward that's good news not sure you and I interpreting the same I know you're good quick bait to say the Internet's being destroyed but it's not what I didn't say that that's I don't know why you're coming on TV but I'm not having I do see the Internet's being you just said preferred you did the 73 ISP if it's preferred if you're favoring one over another that's of this would be this would have been a much better conversation if we were just actually having thanks very much Robert McDowell was he Commissioner from mm I love that I love that the anchor here has no idea what he's talking about and the former FCC chairman keeps saying it's illegal what you're talking about already but none of that matters to anybody the facts don't matter all the matters of the Jimmy Kimmel is going to appear on television every night with a different victim but you can try it out I think it'd be a great segment by the way I think you should do victim of the night right and you should Britt for every policy you should just bring somebody out so everything every time talks tax cuts Jimmy Kimmel should show up with some poor crippled grandmother and every time he talks about gun policy should bring out some some kid who's been shot in the leg and it would just be great I think it and then he can cry over it it'll be it'll be the the weeping of the of the evening ever every single time is yeah okay so before I go any further I'm gonna talk about Russian investigation fallout president Trump making a comment this morning that was rather ill-advised it definitely goes in the bad Trump in the good Trump bathroom category we'll talk about all that plus a little bit of good Trump but first I want to say thank you to our

President Trump and other Republicans now looking to basically curb the Muller investigation on the back of Revelations the people involved in the in the Muller investigation have a political bias all their own which honestly we sort of knew and what you're seeing is that trumps allies are now coming out of the woodwork and saying that Muller needs to pause the probe that moment needs to stop the probe I said all along that's actually counterproductive Muller needs to go forward with the probe and then when he comes up with nothing or even if he comes up with something minor we can all kick back and say listen guys you you came up with something minor after a year of investigation and your team is corrupt the Clinton was able to do this very aptly politically speaking with Ken Starr who did not run a corrupt investigation and who did come up with actual perjury right so I don't see the point in cutting off the investigation short and yet you're seeing advocates for Trump basically say this and it comes off as fear to people who are in the middle it comes off as fear that mother's going to find something even if it really isn't even if it's just that this investigation is fatally flawed if something is fatally flawed right if you've already if you already got shot the investigation there's no need to give the head shot in this particular case I mean Muller has basically he's these runs investigations a wounded animal you don't need to put it out of its misery it's gonna it's gonna die on its own in any case here's Laura Ingraham saying that Muller needs to pause the probe now I'm not calling for mother Muller to be fired it's tempting but I'm not but at the very least he needs to put the brakes on this investigation at least pause it for a bit I agree with what Alan Dershowitz said on my radio show this morning it's time for a respected independent expert to come in and thoroughly examine the individuals conducting this probe and fire anyone inside who evinces even a hint of an appearance of a concept this last call that she's making is the correct one the last thing that Ingraham is saying here is absolutely correct Jim Jordan friendly with representative Jordan from great state of Ohio he went after Ron rose the Deputy Attorney General he said listen is it time for a second Special Counsel to look into how Muller is doing this investigation because maybe what we're learning now is that half of his team was compromised you're the guy in charge you could disband the Muller special prosecutor and you can do what we've all called for appoint a second special counsel to look into this to look into Peter struck Bruce or everything else we have learned in the last several weeks I mean this is what a lot of Americans are believing right now and I certainly do that the Comey FBI and the Obama Justice Department worked with one campaign to go after the other campaign that's what everything points to think about what we've learned in the last several weeks we first learned they paid for the dossier then we learn about Peter struck and last week we learned about Bruce or and his wife now I mean this is unbelievable so what's it going to take to get a second special counsel to answer these questions and find out was Peter struck really up to what I think he was but that doesn't dismiss the fact that the country thinks we need a second special counsel 20 members of this committee the judiciary Kennedy with primary jurisdiction over the Justice Department thinks we need a second special counsel all kinds of senators think we need a special counsel and what fact pattern do you have to have what kind of text message do you have to see before you say it's time for a second special counsel okay so this is I think a valuable call that's happening I think it is worthwhile and I think that the Republicans are doing the right thing when I don't think is worthwhile is President Trump intervening himself so he was asked today about whether who's gonna pardon Michael Flynn Michael Flynn of course the former national security adviser who has now pled guilty to lying to the FBI as I've said before I don't think the Michael Flynn apparently lied to the FBI about anything substantive from what we know it sounds like he lied about having called the Russian government while he was already in the transition team about an upcoming UN vote on Israel and settlements okay I don't see anything there that that is particularly noteworthy and I'm not sure why Flynn lied to the FBI in the first place Trump may very well want a pardon Flynn but it's not smart for him to say so because it looks right now like Flynn is working with the FBI and so Trump's statement here than you might pardon Flynn makes it look like he's trying to bribe Flynn not to talk to the FBI with a pardon offer would you consider a party to Michael Flynn I don't want to talk about Cardinal Mike then yet we'll see what happens let's see I can say this when you look at what's going on with the FBI and with the Justice Department people are very very angry thank you very much everybody okay so that is not particularly smart by the president because now he's open that can of worms the White House tried to close that can of worms again today when Ty Cobb not the great baseball player with the 367 lifetime average Ty Cobb the White House lawyer with the crazy mustache that guy came out and he said that that trump really has no intention of pardoning Flynn for the moment that's the line that Trump needs to stick to so it doesn't look like he's obstructing particularly when Vladimir Putin is doing his best to undermine Trump's credibility this is one area where I think Trump really needs to be more careful Vladimir Putin is playing this game with Trump he knows Trump's mentality is that Trump loves praise Trump responds to praise like if you toss Trump a Scooby Scooby Snack then he will he will go investigate crime for you and you know Vladimir Putin knows that and so he's acting in that way so yesterday he came out and he said the people in the United States should support President Trump because D legitimizing Trump undermines the nation like this is the stuff that Putin's not saying this because he cares about America he's doing this because he wants Trump to do what he wants Trump to do well that's been mean by the nose you know that's been invented by those who are in the opposition people who oppose President Trump to delegitimize time in office really seems strange to me because they don't understand it seems that the donors stand they undermine their own nations they limits the powers of the president has been elected it means that's so Putin's whole game here is not that he loves Trump or that he's trying to help the United States get through a difficult period in politics his game is that he's trying to basically bribe Trump with praise and from is susceptible to that he then said to the press today that Vladimir Putin and he had a very nice call and Putin told him that he was very happy that Trump's economy was doing so well like Putin knows how to play this game it's foolish of Trump to fall into that and Trump should the urge on both on Flynn and on Putin like just back off at mr. president especially when you're doing some good things because the president is doing some good things okay so yesterday at the White House the President did a ceremonial cutting of red tape and it got made fun of on Twitter a lot but who cares about what gets everything has made fun of on Twitter you know president Trump had all of these papers stacks of apparently regulations there were some questions about whether all of those pages actually had printed material on them you remember that President Trump very early on in his presidency I think it was maybe even before he took president Heder and during his transition he brought out a bunch of folders that he said were all of his Trump contracts and that he was going to basically hand those over to his son and then he was going to disassociate and then it turned out that half those folders were filled with empty paper well I don't know if this paper was empty or not but it is true that the president has cut a massive amount of regulation so yesterday at the White House he cut a literal red tape with a giant scissors because this is the kind of stick we do now in politics the truth is Trump knows this this is what Trump is good at the sort of branding stuff everyone can make fun of this but if the image is the President of the United States cutting the red tape and cutting these regulations that is good for him right this is good Trump so he had bad Trump this is good Trump here was Trump yesterday talking about how he'd eliminated 22 regulations for every new regulation added so this is what we have now and when we're finished which won't be in too long a period of time we will be less than where we were in 1960 and we will have a great regulatory climate to do with it she has things called rose that's a big and bridges right yes okay with all the wild enthusiasm of youth the president Rome cuts that it cuts that ribbon one two three pretty spectacular stuff it is mop worthy but it is also true the President of the United States has cut a lot of regulations one of the reasons the stock market is doing well one of the reasons the economy is very hot last quarter was a three percent three point three percent GDP growth and not only that the Fed is raising the rates again so the Fed has been tightening up the monetary flow inflation is is going to be brought under control and the economy continues to be strong some of that is on President Obama and the Republican Congress before Trump but obviously there's a lot of confidence in how the economy is working right now and that is at least in large part due to president Trump's that is good stuff and this is the area where Trump really could succeed this is why it's actually deeply important that the president work on his popularity rating I know a lot of people don't care about this I know a lot of people aren't worried about his popularity they think oh well he can have bad poll numbers and as long as he's doing well we're happy he needs to get his poll numbers up because a lot of the things he's doing are things I like there are things that I agree with a lot of his agenda mirrors my own I think that's wonderful but if you take my agenda and then you smear poop all over it right if you take my agenda and you take your unpopularity and you smear my agenda with unpopularity it makes my agenda toxic that's not worthwhile okay you should not make your own agenda toxic this way and that's why it's very important that the president should be focusing in on his own accomplishments like a laser he should be focusing in on the things he's doing like a laser he should not be making himself more unpopular with foolish statements like the one that he made today about Mike Flynn he should not be engaging on Twitter as much honest to God if somebody unplugged the man's phone and it's just the battery ran down Lord of Comcast decided to cut off Twitter but just for the White House then the then the the his popularity ratings would jump rather dramatically because the fact is the Democrats have nothing here right Nancy Pelosi was saying that the GOP like she's trying to make the case the GOP tax bill is a Pyrrhic victory that it's going to end the Republicans there has never been a tax reduction in history that has rebounded to the negative effect of Republicans ever it does not work that way well we stayed united and we we still continue that fight I think this is a Pyrrhic victory if it in fact it does happen we don't have the votes to take it down and as some of the Republicans see the light and people are speaking out especially since they added the repeal of the mandate the Affordable Care Act individual mandate that has energized the base further but this is who they are this is what they came here to do tax cuts for the rich at the expense of the middle class at the expense of the hill this is all empty it doesn't work Democrats have been trying this for years all the anti tax cut rhetoric is a bunch of nonsense and and so that's why if Trump's agenda where the main focus here as opposed to whatever Trump says today he'd be doing a lot better and so with the conservative agenda he's been a lot more conservative than I thought he would be as president this is not how he campaign I'm very pleased with that but I want to see all of that at the top of the page not all of the other nonsense that seems to cloud our judgment okay so I have a lot to get to today

fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation all righty time for a quick thing I like and then a thing I hate and then we'll get to the mailbag so the thing that I like today I've been doing Beethoven all week so this is one of my dad's favorite pieces this is Beethoven sonata opus 111 the reason that I picked this is not only because it's fun but this particular segment of the Beethoven if you don't hear snidely whiplash in here like Beethoven is so modern that when you listen to his music especially his late music what you will hear is all of these film references that you never had thought about before and you will hear where they came from so this is basically it sounds like snidely whiplash there's no way around it it sounds like Nellas is tied to the tracks and Dudley do-right is gonna show up so here it is from sonata opus 111 from Beethoven that's the thing that Beethoven is if you actually listen to a lot of Beethoven his range is just astonishing and some of the concerts that he has so Beethoven started off as a concert pianist everybody thinks that he's famous for being a composer he started off like Mozart as a performer he was world famous I mean he was famous across Europe he was mostly famous for improvisation so everybody thinks of classical music as being very staid and it's all written on the page as opposed to jazz which is improvisational but Beethoven was very very famous for being the greatest improviser of his age and you can tell that in his development sections in his pieces which I talked about yesterday but they're famous stories of him they would basically have improvisation offs like they would actually have a couple of pianists in a room one person would improvise and the other person would have to do something cooler with improvisation there's a famous story about Beethoven where he was in a bad mood one day and somebody invited him to one of these parties and want him to play and he was not into it and he lost to some guys the only time he'd ever lost he's sort of undefeated and there and then the guy called for a rematch and in the rematch the guy who he was improvident he was improvising against that guy made a mistake he took one of beethoven's themes and started improvising off one of Beethoven's themes his way to mock Beethoven the guy had also premiered a new piece of his Beethoven went over to the the cellist in the new piece took the cellist music turned it upside down and then improvised off the guy's music upside down and so that's how Alan sent a musician Beethoven was the you can't say enough about about the greatness of Beethoven's genius okay time for a couple of things I hated the Mogul mailbag okay so first thing that I hate there's this video going around yesterday that's just insane a lot of the a lot of the northern European countries have gotten very into euthanasia oh and I say that I don't mean that they've legalized euthanasia I mean that they have actually started advocating for euthanasia for people who are mentally handicapped they've advocated for euthanasia for people who are depressed they've relieved restrictions on euthanasia this is doctor assisted suicide of course and this video if this doesn't you know scream a Nazi to you it's because you don't know enough about the Nazis here's a Dutch government official telling a Down Syndrome man that he's too expensive how much he costs the state to be living to be a live here is here's this video it's pretty astonishing says 48 thousand euro per year approximately their donor per downer or down-syndrome person this short ghost so short cost us as a society 48 thousand euros per year for your considerable amount but is it a high one compared to normal person well you can calculate that by taking the big number that 90 billion and divide this amount by the number of citizens in the Netherlands and there are approximately seventeen billion and that will give you approximately the amount of five thousand euros per year per person so you could say that short is almost ten times as expensive then we are those expenses are indeed ten times as high you are a valuable man short okay the reason that this is creepy folks is if you look back at the Nazi eugenics programs this is how they all started look back at the campaign of 1932 one of the things the nazis were saying is there are a bunch of people in our society or the undesirables and they cost the government too much money they cost the government too much money for upkeep and if there were only something we could do with them if there are only something that could do with all these very expensive people it costs a lot of money to keep them alive mm-hmm and there's always a creepy Prelude either these are people who deserve our help or there are people who don't deserve our help they're human beings they can't take care of themselves they deserve our help falling into this trap is is the essence of evil but this is also what socialism ends toward right when the government is quote-unquote paying people to live then it's pretty and private charity withers then it's it's only a matter of time before the government starts thinking of ways out of this particular conundrum okay so final thing that I hate today so I'm mark Stein I thought made a point that is worth noting with regard to sexual harassment is getting all sorts of flack for it but this is a point that I've made - when we talk about sexual harassment and sexual assault we need to be very specific about what it is that we are talking about because vague standards actually hurt women they not only hurt women by conflating sexual harassment with non sexual harassment or conflating mild sexual harassment meaning a guy says something crude in the workplace to rape but they also ends up making it they given a reverse incentive for employers to actually hire women in much the same way that the Americans with Disabilities Act which forced business business owners to buildin ramps in their places of business if they hired a disabled person caused a lot of business owners not to hire disabled people make their actual statistics that bear that out in the same way this idea that sexual harassment is gonna be vaguely defined and we're going to destroy the career of anybody who's ever accused of anything is going to encourage men to hire only other men so they're not accused of this sort of stuff Mark Steyn makes this point yesterday do I really want to be alone with a female employee now think that oh who knows yeah who knows how she's gonna feel about it in 30 years time I mean I don't think that's necessarily in the interests of women in the workplace I don't think it's in the interests of social relations it's an insane moral panic that started with genuine rape genuine violence genuine power issues and now just seems so degenerated into one anonymous accusation can end a career well this is why we have to be very careful and that's why we have to be very specific about what accusations we're gonna hold to you know I've said this over and over and over sexual harassment is is evil sexual abuse is evil but we need to be very clear about what we're talking about and what kind of accusations we're going to take with with the proper amount of severity otherwise the the actual effect will be people making the kinds of decisions you don't want them to make saying I'm not gonna hire that woman because if I hire her then I'm afraid she's going to accuse me of sexual harassment at some point down the line that may be unjustified that is the way people act okay time for the mailbag so Kaitlyn says hi Ben I read on your Fox News power player of the week article they do you initially want it's a double major in genetic science and music what brought you to deciding on political science and then law school thanks Caitlin so what actually brought me to political science is two things one I tried an engineering class a math engineering class and I did okay in it I was getting a name I think I was getting an A up till the final and then I ended up with a B in the class I believe but in any case I was like that's enough of that that was one thing now the other thing that happened is that I was walking through the UCLA campus and I picked up the UCLA daily Bruin which was a far left rag and there was a piece in it comparing then the Israeli Prime Minister of Israel Ariel Sharon to Adolf Eichmann the Nazi and I walked into the offices and said do you mind if I write a counter to this and they said sure and then that became a counterpoint column and I realized that this is something I'm much more interested in then then you know doing all of the things necessary to become an expert in genetics it's not that I wasn't interested in the topic I just wasn't willing to slog through that mud and I have nothing but admiration for people who do I mean for the 1000 times my wife is a doctor which means that she is still basically doing she's residency now right I mean she's been doing this since we met it married for 10 years and she's 10 years in July and she and yet she is still you know doing this so that's that's a long haul Morgan says when you were a child how do your parents encourage you to practice the violin how do you prove to a child there's a long term benefit to playing an instrument well it's very difficult to prove to a small trial there's a long-term benefits playing the instrument you have to make it fun one of the things that was of advantage to me is that my father was a professional musician so he would sit there with the piano and play with me you actually need to sit there and practice with your kid you need to be involved it's boring it may not be fun for you but if your kid knows that you're willing to put in the time then your kid assumes that you are willing also to do that only for things that are important plus kids want to spend time with their parents and if you're willing to spend time with your kid practicing even if you are not you know even even if you're not musically vers then your kid will take it a lot more seriously you can't just tell a kid go practice for half an hour you actually need to sit there with the kid and I think if you're willing to do that then your kid will be more likely to practice also when you get to a certain level it does become enjoyable at the very beginning it's kind of fun because something new and then there's a plateau that gets hit where it becomes very difficult and then when you get good enough then it's a lot of fun again because you're skilled okay al says hey Ben coming from the UK which has health care for all but to my mind is struggling to pay for it your arguments on health care supply interest me greatly I like the American idea that the market is used to drive down costs but at the same time according to the Commonwealth Fund the US government spends way more on health care than most major countries it has the lowest quality of care in terms of outcomes equity and access whereas the UK has the highest even though we're close to rationing the system is so expensive what in your mind is the best system for countries with huge populations like the UK and us who solved the health care crisis given they both spend too much but socialized health care seems to produce better results well it depends on the results that you are seeking so number one socialized medicine has pretty good emergency care but they have not great surgical care in the sense that you have to wait around in line for the rationing to actually take place the five-year survival rate for cancer in the United States is significantly higher than it is in places like the UK specifically because I can go and get the care that I now instead of having to sit around and wait healthcare on demand is you know a market driven health care system is great but it requires the patient to actually do the research and because of the insurance companies that provide a barrier between you and the doctor and you don't actually know what you're paying through the doctor because your insurance company covers it you end up ordering more services than are necessary and in many cases so does your doctor right if you are actually forced to sit there and say okay is it worth an x-ray today right is it worth $1,000 for an x-ray or I can go home and wait for a week you probably go home and wait for a week there actually isn't perfect market para transparency in the United States and that causes a serious problem in terms of the meet between supply and demands in terms of medical care in the United States when these measures where they say that the US has the lowest quality of care in terms of the outcomes equity at access well I mean when you talk about access basically socialized medicine will always have the highest access because people can walk into a hospital and demand service or to a doctor's office and demand service they don't have the highest outcomes in terms of the rate at which those services are provided and in terms of outcomes again it sort of depends on which outcomes you're looking at you can't say outcomes overall also the UK population is not really comparable to the United States either in terms of size or diversity McDaniel says are there any elections in American history you would have found yourself voting Democrat over a Republican well you know that's that's I'd have to think about that one a little bit more I'm trying to think back to a time when the Democratic Party in the Republican Party we're sort of reverses of what they are now I think that in 1948 I would have to seriously consider Truman versus Dewey I think that that would probably be the only one that I'd be that I'd be interested in looking at seriously perhaps 56 Adlai Stevenson versus Eisenhower I might have looked at that one more seriously mainly because I think Eisenhower's foreign policy with regard to the Suez Canal crisis which really happened and at the tail end of his first term that that would have been a problem for me so I think that that's a you know those two races but I don't know I'd really have to study those more to determine how I would have come out whether I really would have voted for the Democrat over the Republican in those races anastasiya says hi Ben I work with a bunch of liberals that hate God one person in particular has zero respect for God my belief in God or just musique human being in general she'll ask zero questions about God and then mock my answer this individual is a supervisor if you're going to HR upper management in case of retaliation losing my job how should I handle this well you should stop interacting I mean frankly it's it's not worth every interaction that may make things chilly keep things professional keep things like don't talk about God if they mock God just say listen I find that offensive and and you know that you don't I don't deserve to have my belief system on I don't mock your belief system and if they have a problem with that tough but I don't think that professionalism in the workplace seems to me a bare minimum no matter what your political viewpoint Jeremy says I bet you've been critical about Democrats and Republicans accused of sexual assault even going so far as to call for Roy Moore to drop out now Franken to resign where do you stand on Trump's allegations and how do they differ from the above-mentioned senators should Trump resign too so what I've said is an ideal world everyone who has credible allegations of sexual assault and abuse should resign and everyone and in an ideal world that would include the president but there is a difference in kind between the Roy Moore situation in the Al Franken situation and Trump the difference in kind is this and not with regard to the allegations regard with regard to the practicality of saying they should resign there's one giant obstacle that is Roy Moore was running an election the people did not elect him okay so that's that Al Franken people didn't know this information when they elected him so now it's new information breaking and that changes the calculation as to whether he should resign all the allegations against Trump are old people know about it when they elected him nothing new has been added to the pie therefore it's difficult to say that on the basis of nothing changing he should now resign that's like saying he should have quit during the election cycle which by the way I believe I said during the election cycle in the middle of the p-word tape so that is that's that's my general take like an ideal world sure in the real world not really Danielle says they used to laugh at the idea of born-again virgins however after listening to you and the importance he placed on entering into marriages virgins I became sad that I could no longer offer this as a non virgin what can I do to bring a sense of innocence to a future marriage do you believe the remaining abstinence until marriage affects the success of the relationship I do think that remaining abstinence until marriage affects the success of relationships generally meaning that people who live together before marriage have a significantly higher divorce rate than people who don't live together before marriage and usually once you're living with a certain level of intimacy sexually you end up living together before you were married and that does not actually end up reflecting married married life is not you living together with your boyfriend married life is you have kids you have a joint bank account you have responsibilities those are not always reflected in just you living with your boyfriend even with the advent of single motherhood I think that the idea of born-again marriage the Virgin's the idea that that you were you've had sex but now with your new partner you're gonna say no sex until marriage I think that's a worthwhile thing because it's asking just practically speaking it's asking for a commitment before you decide to commit your body to somebody and I think that that is a smart play I think then it's a smart play I think it's a demand for a commitment that should easily be met by a good person right the fact that we there are so many TV shows now where they've reversed everything it's really it's funny how this worked it used to be that when I grew up my parents said to me when you get married then you'll have sex and then it turned into when people talk to their kids I said when we love somebody you have sex and now it's turned into you'll have sex and then you figure out whether you love somebody and when you watch TV this is what you see you see two people hop into bed and then they'll be real awkward about whether to say I love you or not so this idea that somehow love has been more closely tied to sex with the disconnection between sex and marriage is absolutely false in fact love has become less connected to sex sex was much more connected with love when love was connected to commitment so I think we've completely reversed the polarity on sex love and marriage Robert says hey man my girlfriend has a very small family I have a very large family she has asked me previously about taking on her family's last name because if I told her dad will likely be the last to hold it I want to hold on to my last name I also don't know why I should seemingly be selfish and have her give it give it up what is your advice and what are your thoughts on last names so when when I got married my wife seriously considered keeping her last name as her middle name so her maiden name is Toledano she seriously thought about keeping that as her middle name when we went to like and I was fine with that because my mom did the same thing she kept her maiden name as her middle man it never bothered me I never thought that was a big deal as long as she took my last name which I the reason I think that's important is because I think that it is important that a family that a family start on the footing of we are a new family now we are our own family or our own family unit and the reason that I think that it's important for I think it is sort of emasculating for men maybe it's a cultural totem but I think it's emasculating for men to give up their family name the idea that a man is supposed to give up you know that what what he has grown up with in favor of the woman's family can be emasculating if you don't find it emasculating I don't problem with it if you do finding it emasculating then I do see a problem with it so this is really between you and the person that you're married to yo for me my wife said to me listen she was thing about keeping that middle name she decided not to she decided to just go with her first nation didn't have a middle name she decide to go with her first name and my last name because she said listen we're now our own family we are our own family unit I want to be part of that family unit with you it was very moving to me frankly and I think it's something that I really appreciate it is gift from her to me it's not something I had to expect but it's something that I certainly appreciate it okay Joe says what is the most infuriating debate tactic used against you and how do you combat it well always the most infuriating debate tactic is when someone will dig something up 10 years old take it out of context and then use it against you and then refuse to hear the answer that's always infuriating because context matters and things that you said in 2007 maybe not may not be things that you agree with today and things that you tweeted in 2012 may not be things that are even taken in context so for me for example there's been a tweet that people have been using against me on Twitter for a long time with regard to Arabs and Israelis in which I said something to the effect of Israelis like to build and Arabs like to live in open sewage the idea of that tweet was not that every Arab likes to live in open sewage you morons the idea of that tweet is that in the israeli-arab conflicts there is one side that likes to build things and one side that would prefer to spend its money on building terror tunnels in the Gaza Strip instead of actually caring for its people and in fact not only am i saying that now I said that in 2012 there are four follow-up tweets I believe and all of them said exactly that doesn't matter people take that tweet out of context and then they use that to say that I'm racist against Arabs which is absurd in that same tweet thread I specifically say that there are Muslim Arabs and Christian Arabs who are wonderful people just not the ones who side with terror groups like Hamas but again that's just an example of how people take things out of context and then use them against you and that I find it highly irritating david says do you feel everyone speaks too slowly yes yes everyone speaks too slowly they are wasting my time it's why I listen to the podcasts that I listen to I actually had to download an app that allows me to listen to podcasts at 2.5 so I listened to all the podcast that I listened to a 2.5 I guess the maximum is 3 it depends on whose podcasting if somebody's a very slow speaker then 3 is the proper speed I hear that it's difficult to listen to my podcast on 2 or were even 1.5 but for those who who are willing to take the the Speed Challenge go for it Michael's has been I've been deeply inspired by your devotion to your religion and dedication to the nation I'm a person raised Christian but I rejected the church and have been living as an atheist for the last fifteen years as a veteran fighting PTSD I found that our Bible talk was leading me to read the Torah and I've been more optimistic than I have been in years I want to know more about converting to Judaism and what your advice would be for a person living in a deeply Christian community Bible Belt coal country with absolutely no Jewish community to turn to is there a place I can find mentorship and what is the view of the Jewish community on conversion so Jewish law generally actually discourages conversion because it's not the world's easiest life right now that to convert you have to convert Orthodox from the Orthodox point of view and that means that you have to take upon yourself all the obligations not working on Sabbath making sure that you eat kosher right you're supposed to commit to everything because if you're gonna commit commit right that's the basic idea here so we actually tell people if somebody wants to convert we actually turn them down three times where we're actually halakhah cailli according to Jewish law obligated to turn them down three times before we're allowed to say yes as far as mentorship you know I think there are a lot of rabbis who can be talked to who are really good on this if you want to email me directly I can probably refer you to some if this is something that you want to take seriously or find out more about it's gonna be very difficult for you to live as a as an observant Jew in an area where there no other Jews because so many Jewish commitments are communal right it's about the nation of Israel and Judaism not just the individual who has a relationship with God in the Torah but I'd be happy to pass on some names for you Daniel says hey been caught your talk in San Francisco this weekend and thought you did a good job here's my question if you are concede Sam's point about free will that low producing people or even criminals are entirely products of their biological predisposition and environment would you still think that the best mindset or policies for maximizing human well-being are ones that promote and empower self-reliance over support from the government so the answer is that the answer is yes but I think the entire thing becomes a giant self contradiction so one of the big problems here is that if you are living in a determinist universe even the question as to what policies the government should pursue assumes a certain level of freewill on the part of government actors to actually change the policies if this is my big problem with with Sam's take on freewill is once you say this once you're living in a fully deterministic universe then to say then I'm going to do what I was going to do right the idea of me even getting up in the morning and going to do things I was going to do that so it's not like I make the choice to do that or I make the choice to support certain policies I was going to support those policies all along and I had no choice in that process it's it's the computer fries itself in other words all of human progress relies on the idea that we have a capacity to discover what's true about the universe and that we have a capacity to make better policy that frees people all of that is based on free will and the capacity for choice you get rid of all that this is the this is the basic question that I kept asking Sam and I'm not sure that I got an answer that satisfied me at the very least I kept saying to him you know Sam you talk a lot about changing the world and you talked a lot about using active verbs making choices but you don't believe in those choices you talked a lot about moral values and what those that value systems should be making a value decision is a choice about hierarchy of values how do you make that decision you can't get from is to all you can't get from we are balls of meat wandering aimlessly through the universe with some capacity for self perception with the idea that there is a moral system that makes certain things more worthwhile than others you can't get from here is a cup to what should I do with this cup unless there was a creator of the cop who had in mind what the cup is for right that's the point that I was making my philosophy bridges the is odd gap this is what Aristotle does Aristotle says what makes a man good is that man was created for a certain purpose once you get rid of purpose once you get rid of design once you get rid of the idea of meaning I don't know how you reconstruct anything that looks like a functional society Ben says hi Ben I was reading an article you retweeted from National Review about how America's youth are lonely are less independent and less attached to community I understand that much of this couldn't be applied to me how does someone who desperately wants to break this rather nihilist youth mentality go about doing it engage the answer is engaged get active they can sit there and you can contemplate it or you can go in to involve yourself with other people it's hard I know it's especially hard when you're a single guy I remember being a single guy before I was married marriage is a wonderful thing I love being married when I was a single guy I did not enjoy being single because it takes actual effort to go out and engage with other human beings you actually have to go out and make an effort to join a group go out and do it it'll make your life better those social engagements will make you more apt to open up to others and that will enrich your experience in life Holden says hi Ben huge fan I go to a liberal school have to debate income inequality next week I've gotten in trouble for speaking my opinions before I'm a little scared can give me some pointers on how to debate income inequality well I mean the number one thing that I always say about income inequality is that what level of their two things number one what level of income equality would be sufficient for you and why so for Bernie Sanders why shouldn't everyone make $40,000 a year that seems the fairest thing right why not be full communist seize all the property redistribute it everybody gets the same thing why not is it really fair that someone should make more than somebody else and why how do you make that decision put the onus on the person to explain what level of income inequality is bad versus what level of income inequality is good second it does not

every time you buy a loaf of bread from the grocer you are making the grocer richer would you prefer not to be able to buy the loaf of bread you've created more income inequality because you just spent money with the grocer you were poorer he's richer are you both worse off are you both better off the answer is you're both better off okay final question Romney says I said I know you said hip-hop isn't music are there any hip-hop songs or artists that you have at least somewhat enjoyed no I it a short answer is no I feel like there's probably some hip-hop that I might enjoy on a visceral level but I have not yet found it maybe that's because I let my app my Apollonian side dominate my Diane Asian side too much in the in sort of Nietzsche and juxtaposition so maybe that's a little sophisticated for a hip-hop breakdown but there you are okay so we will be back here next week we'll be back here on Monday I hope you have a wonderful and a meaningful weekend if you're
