00:00:12,086 --> 00:00:12,687
>> Martha: AT THIS HOUR

00:00:16,824 --> 00:00:17,658
SANTA FE TEXAS SCHOOL SHOOTING.

6
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:19,127
TOUGH DUTY IN A PLACE THAT IS

7
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:21,028
STILL MORNING.

8
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:22,997
NOTICEABLY ABSENT WAS HIS WIFE

9
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:24,599
MELANIA TRUMP WHO HAS BEEN

10
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:26,200
RECUPERATING AT THE WHITE HOUSE,

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,202
BUT WHEN SHE HAS BEEN OUT OF THE

12
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:29,504
PUBLIC EYE IT HAS SPARKED SOME

13
00:00:29,504 --> 00:00:30,004
RUMORS.

14
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:31,005
THE RESPONSE THAT SHE GAVE THIS

15
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:31,305
WEEK.

16
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:33,374
I SEE THE MEDIA IS WORKING

17
00:00:33,374 --> 00:00:34,108
OVERTIME SPECULATING WHERE I AM

18
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:35,243
AND WHAT I AM DOING PAID REST

19
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,811
ASSURED I AM AT THE WHITE HOUSE

00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:38,279
WITH MY FAMILY FEELING GREAT AND

21
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:39,313
WORKING HARD ON BEHALF OF

22
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:40,648
CHILDREN AND THE AMERICAN

23
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:41,616
PEOPLE.

24
00:00:41,616 --> 00:00:42,617
MY NEXT GUEST ARGUES THAT WE

25
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:44,852
SHOULD BE RALLYING BEHIND THE

26
00:00:44,852 --> 00:00:46,521
FIRST LADY TO SUPPORT HER

27
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:47,555
ANTI-BULLYING INITIATIVE WRITING

28
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:49,457
THAT IT WOULD NOT ONLY BE A

29
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:51,726
SHAME, BUT ALSO HURTFUL TO

30
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:53,394
STUDENTS EVERYWHERE OF

31
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:55,196
PARTISANSHIP THWARTS THE

32
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:56,364
FIRST LADY'S ADMIRABLE EFFORT TO

33
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:58,399
REJECT BULLYING AND TO CHOOSE

34
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,634
THEIR BEST BEHAVIOR.

35
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:01,903
HERE NOW ELAINE BENNETT, FOUNDER

36
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:03,738
AND PRESIDENT OF THE BEST FRIEND

37
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:07,608
FOUNDATION, A NONPROFIT ON THE

38
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:08,810
PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL

39
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,610
WELL-BEING OF ADOLESCENCE, AS WE

40
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,046
ALL KNOW IS AT THE CORE OF SO

41
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:13,014
MANY OF THESE ISSUES.

42
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:13,981
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE

43
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:14,315
TONIGHT.

44
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:17,018
IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

45
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:18,886
SHE GETS A HARD TIME FROM SOME

46
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:20,788
CORNERS, MELANIA TRUMP, AND

47
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:24,325
DEFINITELY GAVE OUT A WONDERFUL

48
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:24,992
SPEECH STARTING THIS

49
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,460
ORGANIZATION THAT SHE IS DOING

50
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,862
CALLED BE BEST, WHY DO YOU THINK

51
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:29,130
IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE

52
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,765
LISTEN TO HER?

53
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:32,700
>> IT IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THIS

54
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,302
IS AN ISSUE THAT IS AFFECTING

55
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,972
OUR CHILDREN NATIONWIDE.

56
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,240
WE AT THE BEST FRIEND FOUNDATION

57
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,610
SEE THIS ISSUE OF BULLYING AS A

58
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,244
SERIOUS ONE.

59
00:01:43,244 --> 00:01:47,815
AND ONE THAT IS LEADING INTO

60
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:50,218
INCREASED YOUTH VIOLENCE IN OUR

61
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:52,220
SCHOOLS, AND WE THINK THE

62
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,221
CURRENT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.

63
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:55,056
ALSO HAVE A BASIS IN EARLY ON

64
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:56,624
BULLYING.

65
00:01:56,624 --> 00:01:59,293
AND THE FACT THAT PEERS ARE

66
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,596
TREATING EACH OTHER BADLY.

67
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:02,496
>> Martha: WHEN YOU LOOK

68
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:05,032
ACROSS THESE CASES AND YOU THINK

69
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:07,969
ABOUT THE SHOOTER IN PARKLAND,

70
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:11,239
TO AS THE STORY CAME OUT TO THAT

71
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:13,674
HE WAS SPURRED BY THE GIRL THAT

72
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:14,508
HE LIKED.

73
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:16,811
AND I KNOW THIS AS A PARENT, IT

74
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:18,145
IS SO MAGNIFIED IN THE AGE OF

75
00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:19,213
SOCIAL MEDIA.

76
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:20,281
WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY

77
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:22,783
ELSE ON YOUR PHONE IS JUST

78
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:24,151
HAPPIER THAN HARRY, HAVING A

79
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:25,853
GREAT TIME, THEY HAVE A PERFECT

80
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:26,621
BOYFRIEND, AND WE ALL KNOW THAT

81
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:29,223
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

82
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:30,825
AND THAT PUT SO MUCH PRESSURE ON

83
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:31,993
THESE SITUATIONS.

84
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:33,227
IT DOESN'T IT?

85
00:02:33,227 --> 00:02:35,596
>> THAT IS RIGHT, ADOLESCENCE IS

86
00:02:35,596 --> 00:02:37,732
A TOUGH TIME, ADOLESCENCE

87
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:39,200
TYPICALLY GET THEIR SENSE OF

88
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,402
SELF, WHO THEY ARE FROM HOW THEY

89
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:43,004
ARE TREATED AT SCHOOL.

90
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:44,872
WHAT THEY ARE THOUGHT OF AT

91
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:45,206
SCHOOL.

92
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,140
HOW OTHERS LOOK AT THEM.

93
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,010
THEY CAN HAVE A SUPPORTIVE

94
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,012
FAMILY, AND GO TO SCHOOL AND BE

95
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:53,214
TREATED BADLY, OR BE TOLD THAT

96
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,416
THEY ARE DUMB, OR THEY ARE A

97
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,451
JERK OR A NERD, AND THAT GOES TO

98
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:00,054
THEIR HEARTS, THAT GOES TO THEIR

99
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,188
PSYCHE.

100
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:03,291
AND IN SOME CASES, IT CAN CREATE

101
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,593
INTENSE RAGE.

102
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:07,962
THAT CAN EVEN LEAD, IT CAN LEAD

103
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:10,898
TO DESTRUCTION, IT CAN LEAD TO

104
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:11,265
VIOLENCE.

105
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,833
>> Martha: KNOW THAT YOU RUN A

106
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,702
LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE GETTING

107
00:03:14,835 --> 00:03:16,337
TO SEE THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS

108
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:16,837
ACROSS THE BOARD.

109
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:18,239
I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE

110
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:18,739
EXTREMELY HELPFUL.

111
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:20,107
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE CRITICS

112
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:22,076
OF THE PRESIDENT AND OF THE

113
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,011
FIRST LADY WHO SAY THAT TO

114
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:25,079
BULLYING AND SOCIAL MEDIA

115
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,414
BULLYING WHEN THEY LOOK AT WHAT

116
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,515
THE PRESIDENT IS TWEETING, THAT

117
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:29,650
THEY THINK THAT THERE IS SOME

118
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,619
IRONY IN THAT AND THAT THAT

119
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:33,187
DIMINISHES HER MESSAGE.

120
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:35,389
>> IT DOES NOT DIMINISH HER

121
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,359
MESSAGE, HER MESSAGE IS HER

122
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:39,694
MESSAGE, SHE IS TAKING ON A

123
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:40,795
TOUGH TOPIC.

124
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:42,229
IN THE PAST, OTHER FIRST LADIES

125
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:46,167
HAVE HAD INITIATIVES THAT HAVE

126
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:47,635
BEEN EMBRACED FROM BOTH SIDES OF

127
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:50,037
THE AISLE, AND WE IN THE

128
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:51,005
EDUCATION COMMUNITY KNOW THAT

129
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:53,407
THIS IS A TOUGH TOPIC.

130
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:54,775
AND WE SALUTE MELANIA TRUMP.

131
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:56,077
FOR THE FACT THAT SHE HAS

132
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:59,347
OCCURRED SHOULD TO TAKE IT ON.

133
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:01,182
SHE IS A MOTHER, AND SHE HAS

134
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:02,383
BEEN CYBER BULLIED, HER SON HAS

135
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:04,585
BEEN CYBER BULLIED.

136
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:07,755
SHE KNOWS HOW PAINFUL THAT CAN

137
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:09,757
BE, AND SHE IS TRYING TO START A

138
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:12,193
PROGRAM THAT I THINK HAS A GREAT

139
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:12,626
MISSION.

140
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:14,695
WHICH IS TO ENCOURAGE CHILDREN

141
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:15,997
TO BE THE BEST.

142
00:04:15,997 --> 00:04:17,798
BE BEST, WE HAVE THE BEST

143
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:18,833
FRIENDS PROGRAM WE HAVE BEEN

144
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,735
WORKING ON, WE HAVE A PROGRAM

145
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:22,470
CALLED STOP THE SILENCE, PREVENT

146
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,038
THE VIOLENCE.

147
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:26,374
WE HAVE SEEN CHANGES.

148
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:27,141
AND OUR STUDENTS ARE TELLING US

149
00:04:27,141 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IN THEIR EVALUATIONS.
