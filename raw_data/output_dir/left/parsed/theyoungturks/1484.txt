RECENTLY DONALD TRUMP WAS
RALLYING FOR CANDIDATE MARSHA
BLACKBURN.
THIS WAS IN NASHVILLE AND DURING
THE RALLY HE SPECIFICALLY
BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF AN FBI
INFORMANT INFILTRATING HIS
2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
JUST TO REMIND YOU GUYS AND
GIVE YOU CONTEXT INTO THAT
INFILTRATOR.
IT OCCURRED AFTER A FEW MEMBERS
OF TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN HAD
PUBLICLY SPOKEN ABOUT THEIR TIES
TO RUSSIA.
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS IS A PRIMARY
EXAMPLE.
HE SPOKE TO AN OFFICIAL FROM
AUSTRALIA ABOUT HOW HE WAS
IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE
RUSSIANS.
THAT TIPPED OFF THE FBI AND THEY
DECIDED TO HIRE A REPUBLICAN
INFORMANT TO SEE IF THOSE
ALLEGATIONS OF
COMMUNICATIONS WITH RUSSIANS
WERE TRUE.
WITH THAT SAID, HERE IS TRUMP
LOSING HIS MIND OVER IT
AGAIN DURING THIS RALLY FOR
MARSHA.
THEY HAVE PEOPLE INFILTRATING
OUR CAMPAIGN.
CAN YOU IMAGINE?
OKAY, SO I GIVE YOU THAT
LEAD-IN TO TALK ABOUT TREY
GOWDY, HE
IS THE REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA WHO WAS
RECENTLY ON CBS THIS MORNING TO
DISCUSS THIS VERY ISSUE.
GUESS WHAT HE DID?
HE WENT
AGAINST WHAT TRUMP SAID.
WATCH.
YOU SAID I AM EVEN MORE
CONVINCED THAT THE FBI DID
EXACTLY WHAT AMERICANS WOULD
WANT THEM TO DO WHEN THEY
GOT THE INFORMATION THEY DID.
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?
WHEN THE FBI COMES INTO
CONTACT WITH INFORMATION ABOUT
WHAT A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT MAY BE
DOING IN OUR ELECTION CYCLE I
THINK THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO
RUN IT OUT.
I THINK THE FBI, IF THEY WERE AT
THE TABLE THIS MORNING THEY
WOULD TELL YOU RUSSIA WAS THE
TARGET AND RUSSIA'S
INTENTIONS TOWARD OUR COUNTRY
WHERE THE TARGET.
THE FACT THAT TWO PEOPLE WHO
WERE LOOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED DOESN'T DIMINISH THE
FACT THAT RUSSIA WAS THE TARGET
AND NOT THE CAMPAIGN.
FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE THE WAY
CHUCK GOES TO A RALLY AND SAYS
CAN YOU BELIEVE THE FBI WAS
INVESTIGATING ME?
NORMALLY YOU
SHOULD NOT REALLY BRAG ABOUT
THAT.
ACTUALLY
IT IS A SMART STRATEGY BY
TRUMP BECAUSE IT RILES THE
REPUBLICAN BASE UP, THEY THINK
THERE IS A WITCHHUNT OR AN
ATTACK AGAINST TRUMP BECAUSE
PEOPLE JUST DON'T LIKE HIM.
BUT IN REALITY WHEN IT CAME TO
THIS FBI INFORMANT TRUMP HIMSELF
WAS NOT THE ONE BEING
INVESTIGATED THAT IT WAS THE
KNUCKLEHEADS IN HIS CAMPAIGN
THAT KEPT TALKING ABOUT HOW
THEY WERE COMMUNICATING WITH THE
RUSSIANS.
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
BEING INVESTIGATED.
HE REFERRED TO THEM AND SAID
IF YOU REMEMBER TRUMP ONCE SAID
THAT IF I WAS DOING ANYTHING
WRONG I DO WANT THE FBI TO
LOOK INTO IT TO PROVE I WASN'T
INVOLVED.
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT?
ANOTHER TIME TRUMP POSITIVELY
TWEETED ABOUT SOMETHING HE HAD
SAID ñ OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.
THERE IS NO STRATEGY, HE IS JUST
NOT THAT BRIGHT.
HE IS A DEEP WAY WHEN YOU'RE, HE
IS THE ONE BUT LET ALL THE
NONSENSE BENGHAZI INVESTIGATION
ñ BUT HE IS NOW RETIRING SO IT
FREES THEM UP A LITTLE BIT TO BE
10% MORE SANE THAN THE AVERAGE
REPUBLICAN BEAR.
SOMEBODY TOLD HIM THAT HE IS
ILLEGALLY TALKING TO
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
AND HE SAYS WHAT DO YOU WANT THE
FBI TO DO?
TRUMP SAID WHAT HE WANTED
THEM TO DO ñ IF ANYONE IS
IN TALKS WITH THE RUSSIANS THEY
SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
NOW TRUMP IS BEING SEEN AS
THOUGH HE IS THE ONE BEING
TARGETED FOR POLITICAL REASONS.
THE NARRATIVE THAT TRUMP KEEPS
LAYING OUT INCLUDES WORDS LIKE
FBI SPY AND THAT IS AN ISSUE AS
WELL BECAUSE THIS INDIVIDUAL IS
NOT AN FBI SPY, HE IS AN
INFORMANT.
YOU CAN SAY HE WAS AN
INFILTRATOR.
BUT TO SAY HE WAS A SPY IS
PROBLEMATIC AND HE TOUCHES
ON THAT IN THE NEXT CLIP.
LET ME ASK YOU SPECIFIC
QUESTIONS.
WAS THERE A SPY?
THAT
IS NOT A TERM I'VE EVER USED IN
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
UNDERCOVER, CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMANT ñ
THOSE WORDS I'M UNFAMILIAR WITH.
NEVER USED THE TERM SPY.
WHEN THE PRESIDENT USES THE
TERM SPIKY, THERE WAS NO
SPY INSERTED INTO THE CAMPAIGN?
HAVE YOU SEEN EVIDENCE?
NO, THAT IS AN ESPIONAGE
TERM NOT A LAW ENFORCEMENT TERM.
YOU BELIEVE THE FBI ACTED
PROPERLY?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FBI
COULD'VE DONE OR SHOULD HAVE
DONE OTHER THAN RUN OUT A LEAD
THAT SOMEONE LOOSELY CONNECTED
WITH THE CAMPAIGN WAS MAKING
ASSERTIONS ABOUT RUSSIA.
I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD WANT THE
FBI TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR
NOT THERE WAS ANY VALIDITY TO
WHAT THOSE PEOPLE WERE SAYING.
THAT IS NOT A DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESSMAN.
THAT IS A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN
WHO IS A PARTY LOYALIST AND
DEEPLY RIGHT-WING FROM SOUTH
CAROLINA.
HE WORKED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO?
AND
WHY DON'T YOU WANT HIM TO
INVESTIGATE IT?
WHEN ONE COUNTRY
SPIES AND ON ANOTHER COUNTRY ñ
TO USE IT WITHIN THE SAME
COUNTRY IN A SITUATION WHERE
THERE IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT
MATTER MAKES NO SENSE ON TWO
DIFFERENT GROUNDS.
HE IS TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT IS AN
INFORMANT.
YOU MIGHT USE IT IN A GANG OR
BOMB SITUATION.
HERE THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS THAT
A FOREIGN COUNTRY WAS TRYING TO
INFLUENCE A CAMPAIGN, WHICH
WOULD BE ILLEGAL.
LAW ENFORCEMENT 101.
IT IS NOT BRINGING IN A SPY FROM
SWEDEN.
IT IS JUST REGULAR LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
THAT IS A FUNNY IMAGE BUT I
JUST HAD IN MY HEAD.
ONE OTHER THING THAT REALLY
STOOD OUT TO ME ABOUT THIS
INTERVIEW IS SOMETHING THAT YOU
TOUCHED ON EARLIER.
HE WILL NOT BE SEEKING
REELECTION, HE IS RETIRING.
AS SOON AS REPUBLICAN
POLITICIANS HAVE THAT TINY TASTE
OF FREEDOM THEY DO SPEAK OUT
AGAINST TRUMP, MAYBE IT IS NOT
AS AGGRESSIVELY AS SOME OF US
WOULD HOPE BUT HE IS
CONTRADICTING WHAT TRUMP IS
SAYING.
I AM CURIOUS TO SEE HOW
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN
OFFICE WILL BEHAVE AS SOON AS
TRUMP IS BAD FOR THEIR POLL
NUMBERS.
AND HOW QUICKLY THEY WILL TURN
ON HIM.
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THEY GENUINELY
THINK ABOUT HIM.
DIDN'T I TELL YOU GUYS.
POLITICIANS ARE ñ
DIRTY.
YES.
YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THEM
REACTING TO TRUMP'S POLL NUMBERS
BY HOW MUCH THEY ARE CRITICIZING
HIM.
DEMOCRATS CRITICIZE THEM NO
MATTER WHAT UP FOR THE
REPUBLICANS NOW TRUMP'S POLL
NUMBERS ARE UP A LITTLE BIT SO
THE ONES THAT ARE NOT RETIRING
OR LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
OF COURSE MAYBE THERE COULD BE
SPIES ALL OVER THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE DEEP STATE COULD BE
FIXING THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.
BUT MEANWHILE WHEN HIS MEMBERS
THINK THEY ARE LIKE WELL, I
WOULD NOT SAY IT THAT WAY.
AS WE GET CLOSER TO ELECTIONS,
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON TRUMP'S
POLL NUMBERS BECAUSE POLITICIANS
ARE NOT PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY
COURAGEOUS
DOW THERE ARE NOT LEADERS, 999
9999 OUT OF 90 AND HAVE THEIR
FOLLOWERS.
FOR A GUY LIKE
DOUGHTY ON HIS WAY OUT HE IS
LIKE NO I AM NOT GOING TO AGREE
TO AN INSANE CONSPIRACY ABOUT
HOW THE FBI HAS SPIES AND THE
LATEST THING TRUMP SAID IS THEY
ARE GOING TO FIX THE ELECTION.
ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT HAS
TOTALLY LOST THEIR MINDS OR
IS LYING ON PURPOSE FOR
POLITICAL REASONS.
HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH OF
A REASON TO ANYMORE.
IF
YOU ARE LYING ABOUT HOW THERE
COULD POTENTIALLY BE MEDDLING
IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS TO
SCREW OVER REPUBLICANS SO
YOU CAN HELP YOUR POLL NUMBERS,
YOU ARE A BAD PERSON.
THAT COULD LEAD TO A DANGEROUS
RESULT.
PEOPLE WHO SEE THAT MAYBE IN
SOME SEATS DEMOCRATS WILL
THINK THERE WAS MEDDLING
INVOLVED THERE.
IT IS DANGEROUS.
IF YOU ARE A POLITICIAN WHO IS
PLAYING INTO THAT RIDICULOUS
NARRATIVE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU
ARE DOING TO THE FUTURE OF THE
COUNTRY.
THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE
UNDERMINING THE FORM OF
GOVERNMENT AND OUR DEMOCRACY.
THAT IS WHY IT DRIVES ME CRAZY
WHEN TV KISSES THE ASS OF
THESE POLITICIANS.
THEY DON'T
BELIEVE ANYTHING.
THEY BELIEVE IN GETTING
REELECTED IN FINDING OUT
WHAT THEIR DONORS WANT AND
SERVING IT.
THEY ARE NOW HONORABLE PEOPLE.
THEY CARE ONLY ABOUT THEMSELVES.
IT IS GOOD REASON WHY THE
COUNTRY DISGUISES POLITICIANS.
THE POLLING SOMETIMES AS LOW AS
7%.
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WHEN WE
DID A REVOLUTION AGAINST THEM
HAD A ONE THIRD OF THE COLONY
SUPPORTING THEM.
CONGRESS IS IN WAY WERE SHAPED.
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT
CONGRESSMAN TODAY ARE THE
PEOPLE ON TV.
THEY ARE EMPOWERED TOGETHER.
AND YOU CAN TELL AS A
CONGRESSMAN IS LEAVING FINALLY A
LITTLE BIT OF HONESTY WHICH
GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE
MOUNTAIN OF DISHONESTY THAT
NORMALLY THESE POLITICIANS LIVE
IN, BUT YOUR TV HOST NEVER
POINTS OUT.
