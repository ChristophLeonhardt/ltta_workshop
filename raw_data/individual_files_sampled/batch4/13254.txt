the new Republican tax bill will lower taxes for most individuals and for corporations now it is the end of this health care the debate on health care is life death this is Armageddon after theft but the universal devastation brought on by our leaving the Paris Accord and the end of net neutrality only the smoking ruins of a once bright and beautiful earth remained but now with the tax bill those smoking ruins have now been reduced to the smoking ruins of smoking ruins in which even the dead have died and also will be paying lower taxes but wait out of the silent wreckage of humanity's self-destructive madness a distant sound is heard as of one Roxy for the post-apocalyptic deeps of unimaginable blackness as the sound goes we gonna win without caring for our veterans we're gonna win with every single facet we're gonna win so much you may even get tired of winning you'll say please please it's too much oh so pretty I feel pretty and witty the warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is

the holiday so it won't be on this Friday and won't be on next Friday we will put up a little the talk that Knowles and I did is as a book marker you know to keep your place but catch up if you haven't been listening to another Kingdom catch-up listen to the first ten episodes the next three will be there as the new year begins so the house as I was driving in the house passed this bill it's now heading toward the President's desk this is I mean they had this kind of thing where the Senate the House passed it and then they found a glitch so it couldn't be passed the reconciliation so the Senate passed it and then the house had to pass it again and now the house has passed it again and they did it that's it's unbelievable I mean it really is I mean they said it's like after they told us Trump couldn't get elected they told us you know he was gonna be a terrible president he was gonna just be a total Lib they told us all these things that just haven't happened and that's what we're gonna talk about a lot of this today just all the stuff all the stuff that they've been saying Chuck Schumer on the on the in the Senate he said you are going to rue the day here's Chuck Schumer as crying Chuck he's crying now but he's kind of left to cry about areas for real they will rue the day they did it given the bill substance it's no surprise they're in such a rush eleventh hour backroom deals have managed to only make their bill even worse they don't want people folks they don't want to discuss it they don't want to have it have sunlight shed on it they don't want anyone to know what's in it you know what I mean this has been since the Democrat Party and CNN and NBC and ABC and CBS are all basically one entity now the mainstream news media we played this stuff yesterday you could see it the mainstream news media is simply an arm of the Democratic Party they have put out this disinformation campaign so that most people think that their taxes are either going to go up or won't be affected there everybody and so everybody hates the spill so CNN first creates this situation and then they celebrate it here's their reporting on the bill sorry here's the real CNN things just before the bill passed they are warning that they're gloating they're gloating this is gonna be the worst thing that ever happened to Republicans this isn't what America had on its Christmas list after all new this morning signs at the Christmas present that the president promised the country if tax bill is not what the country actually wants the house is expected to pass the bill to say afternoon but it is a bill that is getting less popular it seems by the day that's right a brand new CNN poll this morning shows 55% of you out there opposed it that is an increase of 10 points of negativity from just last month we are not done talking about this not even close joining us now CNN's politics reporter and editor at large crystal is a crisp 55% of Americans say they oppose this tax bill in our latest polling that is greater opposition than it was just a month ago and as poppy was noting before that opposition growing across all groups what does that tell you oh yeah tells you you're making a gigantic gamble if you're the Republican Party we begin with what President Trump calls a big beautiful Christmas present for America the tax cut bill that most Americans don't approve of so so first they spread the disinformation then they're so thrilled that people are believing them and this is the power of the media there's no question about it because people do not know what's in this bill because these guys have been purposely misleading them but there is another power there it is called the power of reality remember when Obamacare was passed about 60% of the people opposed that so many people opposed it in fact that they Democrats lost remember Scott Brown won in Massachusetts which has never had never happened I don't think a Democrat is won in Massachusetts basically since the Revolutionary War so that was that was a big shock and it just got worse and worse remember the disastrous unrolling of Obamacare they were destroyed in the midterm elections the Democrats were destroyed in the midterm elections and right now it looks bad for the Republicans in the midterm elections but as it became clear that Obamacare was an incredible boondoggle and that Obama had lied about it got worse ORS but even so even so Obama won election and it was and Ted Cruz remember Ted Cruz that was the other thing that happened where people were predicting according to the polls at the time Ted Cruz shut down the government in 2013 because he didn't want to fund Obamacare he was trying to stop Obamacare and he shut down the government the poll said oh this is a disaster and they were telling oh the Republicans are gonna be swept out of office that was a tsunami for the Republicans so the thing is the thing is reality is going to be very different for this tax bill I believe then for Obamacare Obamacare forced people this is the other thing it takes away the Obamacare mandate that's probably one of the big guy keep forgetting that I keep forgetting to mention that that is a huge deal it gives Americans it takes away the evil of taxing Americans for not doing something that was a that was a tax on Americans for not obeying that what the government wanted you to do I mean that was it was so wrong it was so wrong the Supreme Court should have struck it down they really should have there was no way that was a constitutional provision they kept saying it's a tax it's not a tax and you know they just gave John Roberts gave him any interpretation they wanted it was so wrong this gets rid o Biden might have said this is a big freakin deal and so and and just to remember that when the Republicans then went to try and repeal Obamacare there were a lot of people in their districts who didn't want them to do it because they've gotten used to the free candy or what they you know those few people who were getting free candy out of it and so you know once once the economy takes off as I believe it will it already has I think they already had have upgraded the last quarter to four percent once that happens I think this is just going to change I think this is an area is gonna change and here's what I want to know here's here is really the telling I became a conservative almost entirely because everything Reagan said would happen happened and everything the media said about Reagan turned out to be untrue that is almost entirely why I changed parties when the Berlin Wall fell down there was simply no doubt in my mind that it was Ronald Reagan the dumb actor is right you know I just believed that I believed he was a dumb actor or war monger he was destroying the world same old same kind of panic was being sold both by the left and by the right even the people on the right were making fun of Reagan for stupidity and his simplicity and his optimism and his sunny but all that stuff came under attack from the guys at National Review and it came under attack by conservatives Ronald Reagan said to his Secretary of State he said we're going to win the Cold War and he said well what does that even mean and he said it means we win and they lose and when the wall came down I thought son of a gun that's stupid war mongering actor was exactly right and the same kind of thing happened to the economy we had been through the Jimmy Carter economy we were waiting on line for gas you know you forget that we're waiting on line for guess people were so depressed he was said Jimmy Carter was making speeches like say something nice about America that's how depressed people were he talked about the National malaise because what Democrats don't understand where this stuff is coming from you know just kind of drop it's like the gentle rain from heaven they just think oh why is everybody so depressed just because I've sat on the economy they keep telling you you know it's the new normal you always hear this from the Democrats it's the new normal it's 1% 2% growth that we got under Obama it's the new normal it's not the new normal it have to do with the fact that he chased all this money out of the country that the regulations businesses couldn't depend on the regulations so when reality happens people notice people noticed they read the book of nature just like they read the news you know and so so I just believe that this is going to be a an absolute bombshell of an economy I think it's gonna go off it's already gone off like crazy just I just really on the strength of Trump's optimism it's not his promises to do regulate and now the deregulation has come true now the tax corporate tax rate is coming down so what I want to know is are people paying enough attention did they hear Nancy Pelosi say what she said and are they gonna look out the window and say huh the world is still here and in fact I'm making a fortune and my kid has a job but he's not living in my basement anymore and suddenly you know the world is a lot nicer than it used to be and that's gonna change everything so let's take a look back you know part of this you know let's just remember all the stuff that the news media got wrong first of all starting with the Martin Luther King bus that was moved from the Oval Office but it wasn't removed from the Oval Office of some guy I think was from Time magazine tweets out that oh the evil racist Donald Trump has removed the Martin Luther King bust from the Oval Office and then said oh it was just an error I didn't see it there so I assumed it was gone well none of this is just an error no it's you know it's what they call to anti Trump I think Byron New York said there's a to anti Trump to check you know it's sometimes sometimes their stories in the news media they say that story's too good to check well if it's too anti Trump they don't check it the AP in the New York Times said 17 intelligence agencies said that Russia interfered in our election it was for they don't they never mentioned the fact that they never looked at they they never got to examine the intelligence agencies in law he's not really got to examine Hillary Clinton's computer that that was done by their own people the EPA director Scott Pruitt I'm sure these are just off the top of my head the EPA scott director scott pruett never met with the CEO of Dow Chemical that they reported that and then he decided not to ban or lift a ban on a pesticide James Comey did tell Trump he wasn't under investigation three times Anthony scaramouche he wasn't under investigation for dealings with a Russian bank that Mike Flynn Michael Flynn was not going to testify that the candidate Donald Robinson in a steak after mistake but gray bian which is a wonderful website I'm glad to get that chance to mention them because I've one of the several several websites I visit every morning to gather sound for the show is gravy and they do a wonderful job of compiling stuff they compiled they look back of ten moments in the new news media not of mistakes not of mistakes because mistakes they can always make an excuse for the mistakes even though the mistakes were always on one side but they compiled just an embarrassing collection of attitude ways that they're manipulating your ways that they're manipulating the the public so that to create this atmosphere of hysteria when as I said yesterday nothing is happening except Republican governance Trump is not doing anything radical you know he's not he's just he is doing what Republicans are supposed to have stood for all this time so let's begin I want to begin with this not because it's such a big a big gaffe but just because it actually does reveal what the mainstream media thing this is Mika Brzezinski on Morning Joe and listen carefully to what she says is cut number 10 he could have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control exactly what people think and that is the that is your job it's our job to control what people think so let's take a look at some of the ways they control what people think let's let's go first of all to these are some of the most embarrassing moments of the year on the media let us go first to cut number eight which we will put under the heading emotionalism this is just Jimmy Kimmel coming out and attacking the Republicans for wanting to repeal the boondoggle call and and the anvil that has been tied to the foot of the economy for all these years Obamacare there's life it just wouldn't happen not here but the comedy never ends on that show does it it's like that's great let's look at let us look at after the election here is a collection again this is from gray bein a collection of questions that were asked to Hillary Clinton asking you the tough questions about her email about her mistake in Libya about her bad you know term as Secretary of State about her corruption with the Russians or dealing with the Russians they were really hammering her with tough questions here they are what is that and dare you give me a demonstration well at this stage in your life does even having to ask yourself the question of why her do you give absolution to those who didn't vote to women who didn't know Hillary Clinton is now subject to a brief interruption because of this important video of a sneezing Panda alright Madam Secretary what's your favorite flavor of ice cream oh the hard questions how did you get out of bed in the morning because I did not run for president and I could barely do it well Cheers it is unbelievable and the whole thing about Donald Trump their attacks on him as a moral person which I think a lot of which I think are actually legitimate they keep leaving out blanking out the fact that they were voting for Hillary Clinton that was the choice we had and there's just no taking that out of the equation there was no taking it out of the equation that in when you're talking about who we voted for we were voting choosing between Donald Trump who has done a lot of things that are questionable his treatment of women's and so on the way he has lowered the tone of conversation all of that I'll accept all of those charges but he was running against a crook he was running against an incompetent he was running against a woman who stood in front of the bodies of dead Americans and lied to the American public about how they got that way after Benghazi she's absolute gangster and they're the area's tell you know Stephen Colbert toasting her away I mean you can never forget that whenever whenever my liberal friends come after me about who Donald Trump is I acknowledge a lot of it I you know I think he's rude I think he's has brought down the conversation I think he does things that you know he hasn't got a feel sometimes for what a president should say but he's doing he has done a great job at the presidency and if he is not the the highlight of you know if he's not Abraham Lincoln listen I wish Abraham Lincoln were running against George Washington that's what I wish I wish that I had been able to say wow these I don't know which of these guys is greater you know this is uh I gotta really work on this which of these guys are great we're not living in that time anymore is gone and am i sad about it yeah but come on this is it this is the only life he got it's I'm not gonna sit around and stab myself over the fact that the president is rude especially when he's doing this terrific terrific job he's doing let's look a little bit more of these gray bian clips this this is a great one this is a cut number six this is the absolute craziness of of the Trump hate in the media when you were president with absolutely no morals who's a bully who acts like a bigot and a racist and is a sexist and a sexual harasser awesome stage the hostile takeover the Republican Party on the right and now we are we are which I decide outside of the Civil War World War two this may be the most cataclysmic event the country has ever seen okay I may have added that last one that was Mark Halperin serial sexual abuser alleged sexual abuser mark halpern saying that you know with world war ii he did say that right i did hear him say that world with world war ii the Trump was one of the great cataclysms the election of a Republican president which is all he's turned out to be I mean he you know Ann Coulter is angry at him because they're not a foot of the wall has been built the influx of illegal immigrants has virtually stopped so you know we don't even the wall as a symbol I guess it remains he promised a wall I guess he has to build something that looks like a wall at some point but you know you're still complaining about that when when all these victories and I'm not even gonna go through them again all these victories for conservatives it has been an amazing year I was on the radio in Chicago yesterday after this is kind of funny I go on this wonderful show and I think I think it's Dan and Amy and I talked to them every couple of weeks they call me up it's a morning radio show in in Chicago and it's usually kind of a love fest because we kind of agree on virtually everything and they read my book the great good thing and they really like it but the male host was out and this guy Sean had was stepped in form just before I went in the producer said so it's Sean today you want to say Sean and Amy so I said fine and I went on the air and they asked me about this article I had written about how Trump had made the government more moral talk about that on the show and Shawn just went off on me and started yelling to me about all the things he hasn't done and I said Shawn you know it's been a year of the presidency you could take any president from George Washington on and talk about the things that he hasn't done to the things he has done have been amazing all right so let's move on to this this is another favorite of mine this is number five from gray bian this is the media begging begging for Trump to be impeached this could lead down the road to impeachment but we weren't anywhere near that yet does this breaking news tonight change your view on that are true are we getting closer and closer to the possibility of yet another impeachment process so in terms of impeachment are you taking action working with Republicans or doing anything that would actually move that agenda forward do you harbor any hopes that you will find a conservative legal mind to match your desire to proceed with impeachment are you suggesting that President Trump should face impeachment no I'm not suggesting that congressman what is your case for impeachment explain what do you think of this impeachment possibility what's more needed to prove it obstruction of justice and the president fires the guy coming after me after asked him to drop the case what more do you need is that the impeachment is the remedy I mean the president can't always remedy and the reason they want to impeach him is because Donald Trump jr. has committed treason I mean this is this is the hyperbole we've dealt with emotionalism hysteria now hyperbole this is cut number three does that mean that Paul manta Ford Jared Kushner are bordering on treason as well as along with Don jr. and then also that Michael Flynn is bordering on treason and that the President himself is bordering on treason because all of them have sought out damaging information when about hillary clinton from the russia's li there's outright treason i mean there is no question that what he is doing is giving aid and comfort to the enemy Donald Trump jr. what he did was a threat to our democracy and borderline trees the Fox report in the New York article come very close if the crossing the line with respect to treason if those facts are true its it straight none dare call the tree I mean so this is the news that people are getting right it's treason it's Russia Russia's taking over you know I'm Jimmy Kimmel's kid is dying because of the Republicans and you know it goes it goes on and on and on and I just want to close with what is in this gravy enlist as their top thing I want to remind you of the way that Obama was recovered Obama who did smoosh the economy Obama who abandoned the Iraqis Obama who wouldn't go into Syria who let Isis spread like a wildfire Obama who wanted to use the IRS to silence his enemies truly what should have been one of the biggest scandals in this country ever that he used the IRS to do that Obama whose Justice Department we now know was so corrupt that they were actually turning a blind eye to the drug dealing the influx of cocaine coming in from Hezbollah we now know this through this political article but Politico article they were turning a blind eye to the drug in the influx of cocaine from Hezbollah a terrorist group in order to make a deal with Iran even larger terrorist group to let them what what is ultimately going to allow them to get nuclear weapons this is the way the reporters treated Obama hate crime protection legislation Don't Ask Don't Tell repeal marriage equality nationwide and ensuring transfer people feel physical acceptance how do you think LGBT rights will rank in terms of your accomplishments in your life long before today you've been considered or rights person under your watch people have said that you had expanded the rubberband of inclusion and with the election and the incoming administration people are saying that rubber band has recoiled and maybe is even broken and I'm taking back to a time on Air Force one going to Selma Alabama when you said your job he wants to close the gap between with that what gaps still remain when it comes to rights issues on the table and also what partners you play in fixing those deaths in your new life and the least I can so so the last question is Ramona I we cut it off because it just goes on for a long time but the last question is just women saying it's been an honor it has been an honor to cover this delightful delightful president but you know what what is interesting again just talking about the difference between the book of the news and the book of nature the book of reality is that the Democratic Party was destroyed by Barack Obama he's now left this leftist party which may or may not regain strength but of course as Ronald Reagan told us you know they can't help themselves they govern like leftist and so they always get thrown out of office so even while they created this Saint in Barack Obama and even while the racial pathology that they have sold to America and people weren't allowed to dislike him and they cease very popular his his programs were not popular if they had been Democrats would have been elected in the sent with the same enthusiasm that he himself was he was an excellent politician he did a great job but then even the news media doing what they were doing there and doing what they're doing at Trump cannot override reality so we'll see we'll see what's happens the 2018 midterms look dangerous right now but we'll see what happens if the economy takes off we got the mailbag coming up the last mailbag of the year so last chance to solve all your problems but first we got to break away from Facebook and YouTube come on over the Daily wire calm you can listen to the rest you could have watched the whole thing on The Daily wire calm if you'd only subscribe for a lousy 10 bucks a month for a hundred bucks you get a subscription for a full year and the leftist tears mug which is going to be filled magically all year long come on over and listen to the mailbag all right all right from illusion I'm an aspiring writer of fiction and I'm just wondering what your best advice would be for someone who is fully Christian but wants to write well good point I keep writing the god ending or that theme and I'm wondering how to write as a Christian but not just for Christians without being preachy it's a really good question I talk about in my book of my conversion the great good thing that one of my prayers as I realized that I was becoming a Christian as please Lord don't make me a Christian novelist because I just hate that stuff I hate that happy talk stuff I even hate when one of my favorite writers CS Lewis doesn't so many of his Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe his Narnia books basically set up this beautiful fairy tale and then the lion who represents Christ comes on it solves the whole problem and I think that that is the way that Lewis saw saw the world and it is those those are very popular and so the question Lucian is asking us to fold first of all there is a huge audience for sappy Christian fiction there's a huge audience for sappy Christian fiction and there's a huge contingent of people who complain when there's Christian fiction isn't sappy enough when it contains real words that people use when it contains real evil when people get away with evil as they do in real life when bad things happen to good people all those things that are part of the world as God as God governs it that were the real world that God governs but if you want to be a good writer that's where you have to go you have to go against the audience that's demanding sappiness and let them look for other writers the way to do this is to fold it in fact it's in keeping with the theme we've been talking about all day you've got to read the book of nature you've got to observe how life actually works and observe the fact that God doesn't always come to people that people or that is that God doesn't always save people from the pains of life people die young children die which is one of the great you know evils that you have to wrestle with when you're trying to have faith in the goodness of God people are in grief you know God is comforting God will make you whole god will heal you he will give you joy even in grief but but that's a different thing than saying that he makes everything work out you don't have to have you know I sort of became as a thriller writer I tried to become a master of the happy sad ending where the crime would get solved but you would still see that it was a sad world so you do have to you just have to pay attention and the other thing to do is to read books that aren't necessarily Christian books because there are many many many great novels and great movies and great plays that are written and performed by people who aren't Christian at all and who sometimes see the world in a very clear way so for instance there's a movie called open water it's not a great movie but it's a good little thriller about people being lost at sea and and attacked by sharks and I always really liked this movie because it's a nihilistic movie it's a movie about how there's no meaning in life at all except maybe the fact that we love one another and because of that it doesn't let GUI Christian thoughts get in the way and it actually observes the things that happen in life very accurately and frequently new lists are able to do that where Christian writers get lost in this misty glow of of trying to project their inner life the inner beauty of Christian living on to the outer world which is full of brokenness sin and tragedy so pay attention to life and pay it to and read that's the best the best advice for any fiction writer is read read read and don't just read the stuff you like that was written yesterday read the stuff throughout history that's been that it's been deemed great it will be an education from Kyle I am a dear bastion of conservative morality well boy I hate to get that tag sure I'm not sure putting that on my business card I'm a 21 year old male that many people say acts much older than I am I hold myself to a high moral standard I have two college degrees or careers in paramedic my question is something I've been grappling with for a while now I'm in love with a lady that that I've been with for almost two years throughout that relationship she cheated on me lied to me several times broke up with me after nearly six months of being apart I started seeing her again but since then she is still hold on to the held on to the belief of wanting to remain single and act her age I have tried to help her through her issues including recent criminal drug charges and explained to her that there's no value in acting like a kid she does not take this this advice or like the advice she wants to experience things so she can grow up at her own pace it's been very painful to me and though I am able to be faithful to her because I've always been monogamous I still can't help but feel that I'm being taken advantage of and maybe missing more promising opportunities and attempts to help her and be with her I ask you for your advice as I do love her but being with her is more painful than I think love should be here's my advice dump er you know be a man yeah this is a masochistic relationship your this is a woman who's never gonna be anything but a liar if you dump her she's gonna come back and beg to be taken back I'll bet don't take her back this is time for you to move on put your big-boy pants on get rid of her that you know she's just she's just trouble she's a self-destructive person and and you are being self-destructive by being with her there are plenty of good women out there who will help you in your life and help you move forward they will have troubles you'll have to help them through but they won't be the troubles of cheating on you and lying to you and taking drugs that's never gonna work that is never gonna work she may reform she may pretend to reform you haven't got time you've only got your life go get yourself another girlfriend you're not I'm telling you this is this is a this is manhood time this is what yeah this is what a man has to do sometimes we all fall in love with people who are bad for us you'll fall in love with somebody else who's good for you do it that's my advice all right from Tiffany what advice would you give to an atheist who honestly wants to find God if he's there I was raised Christian but never really believed in any of it however I've recently been drawn to conservative views and the idea of a higher power I saw a few minutes of an interview you did on the Rubin report and thought you might have some words of wisdom to shine a light on my situation I do have some words it was first of all let me sell you my book because I think I'd be a fool not to but also a lot of people have found it helpful it's called the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ and it charts my conversion which is not a conversion through some kind of miraculous light but is a conversion through reason essentially and through beauty be it through through truth and beauty and so I think that's why it helps a lot of people who aren't helped by preet more preaching books but there are other great books too of course like mere christianity by CS lewis and those are all things that you should be reading if you want to get in touch with God but the most important thing just with God to get in touch with God is get in touch with God you know his lines are open he will answer your call pray to Him you know I have a video somewhere that I think you could still find on YouTube called find God in 60 days and it talks about how to pray and it's a jokey video but it's serious too which is that I talk about every day every single day get yourself alone so you can speak out loud and pray to God for 10 minutes if you've got the time 10-15 minutes talk to him out loud the reason I say out loud is when you speak out loud you finish your sentences and your ideas don't trail off and you don't go off into some kind of fantasy world of your own you are directed to be in conversation God will answer you this is the Andrew Clavin guarantee if God doesn't answer you I will give you your afterlife back you know I will give you your meaningless life back he will answer you and do that you know I recommend doing it for 60 days but do it for as long as it works for you he will talk to you and if you I think you should be reading the Bible especially the Gospels I think you should be reading books like CS Lewis's book and I do recommend mine with with a whole heart you know I don't feel bad about doing that but while you're doing that you should also be talking to God I mean the Bible is a way of knowing God so you don't follow you don't mistake God for your father who might not have been that nice to you and you start to think well that God's gonna be like that the gospel is a good way of finding out who God really is through Christ and while you're doing it talk to him and you will see he will he will answer you you will find amazing things happen now that truly amazing things you will go to bed with a question and wake up with an answer all kinds of things will happen to you and it will be a worthwhile experience try it alright let's see a dev time for a couple more from Anthony my girlfriend and I have been dating for three years now and are getting to the part of our relationship where we're discussing marriage the one big thing is in the back of our minds that is I'm Christian and she's Jewish I've studied the faith and I'm a firm believer in the Bible she however knows very little about Judaism but keeps it as a heritage thing rather than a religion I've tried to open up to her about Christ and she seems interested but also hesitant due to her heritage and the pressure from her family any advice on how to go further would greatly be appreciated well first of all you have to ask yourself if it's a deal-breaker for you if she remains not a Christian and I think that's important for a couple of reasons it's not a good reason to convert because she wants to be married to you that's not a good reason to convert their only reason to become a Christian is if you believe that it's true that's the only reason the only reason to become a Christian is if you think it's true because why should you believe in a fantasy that's a silly way to live so if it's a deal-breaker for you then you've got to deal with that if it's not you know you don't have to convince her live as a Christian act as a Christian that will be more preaching than you know she needs you do have to discuss before you get married the children because that will be a big deal you're gonna want to raise those children Christian you're gonna want to know that she is on board with that and don't by the way sell the heritage points short I write about this and the great good thing too about being a Jew because I'm a Jew who converted and I write about the fact that Christianity has a 2,000 year history of oppressing Jews and the Jews feel that Christians are the enemy and that is written into the blood of Jews and they have a and there's a point to it obviously in America the Christian Church is one of the best friends the Jews have ever had anywhere but it it takes a long time for those thousands of years of accrued history and accrued oppression to be washed away by the good behavior of most Christians in America today so you know you can't really take that away I mean like the people well you know when I converted I I converted and I told the Jewish friend that I've been baptized and his first words to me where they'll still kill you they'll still kill you that was this first the first words out of his mouth not congratulations not oh that's interesting but they'll still kill you so that goes very deep but discuss the children and discuss with yourself whether that's a deal-breaker because you shouldn't be converting her in order to marry her she should only convert if she's convinced and he shouldn't spend a lot of time for aiding her and preaching to her about this I want to find the one that I said I was gonna deal with let me just see if I've got it here yes here it is from Dylan dear all-knowing Clavin love your show I've been happily married for about a year and a half to my amazing and loving wife good on you pal however in regards to my in-laws there's a lot of conflict my my wife has confessed to me while we were dating that her brother is gay and recently that her younger sisters following transgenderism and now identifies as a boy as a Christian I continued to treat both of them with the utmost respect and love and love them as Christ has called us all to love the problem however is I'm afraid of exposing my future children and trying to explain what it means I don't want them to choose that lifestyle at a young age my wife and I have established when he raised our children based on Christmas principles yet I don't know how to one day talk to my future kids about my in-laws being gay and transgender it's been an issue I've been praying about and I don't know how to go about it what should I do well first of all Dylan you're I'm really glad that you're treating them with love and respect it is what I believe Christ would want you to do it is not for you to judge where they stand with God at all and I but I do understand where you're coming from the the other thing about this is they're going to meet in their lives gay people and transgender people and so this is your opportunity to help them to meet those people with love and understanding but not necessarily to find it seductive or appealing I mean look if you raise them in a happy home where you treat your wife with respect and she treats you with respect and you treat God with respect and they are going to take your principle seriously now you know I I don't know I believe that most gay people are gay genetically I believe that that's true the transgender thing I seems to me a little bit more of a you know a girl who thinks she's a boy a boy who thinks she's a girl is by definition deluded because she's not a girl so that to me seems to me more of a delusion but the point is you want them to come to the place that you're at which is that you treat these people with love and respect but you feel that the Christian path leads another way and I think that that this is your opportunity to teach them that in close up close quarters I mean of course you're worried about it but you they're gonna make much worse things than that they're gonna find much more evil in the world than that certainly and and they're going to meet more gay people and you're just gonna want to teach them your approach to this which seems to me you know a really good approach it's not mine I don't necessarily share your attitude about this but at least you know you're treating them with love and respect and that's all anybody can ask of anybody you have the right to your opinions as I do to mine fair enough yes yeah let me do one more here yeah okay here's a good one from hey Andrew I'd make a comical title for your name but it doesn't feel appropriate given the nature of my question my dad actually my stepfather but he is and always will be my dad is going through a difficult of emotional period I've seen him drinking and smoking a lot and he's recently been subtly mentioning contemplating suicide I've confronted him told him to seek therapy or marriage counseling with my mom but either he is too proud and stubborn or has given up entirely and refuses to take my advice or even acknowledges he needs help from a therapist I can only have so many emotional and hard conversations with them that don't solve or change anything because no matter what I say nothing gets through I don't know what to do there's a lot more I could say but I need some advice and if you could maybe give a few words for my dad I think he could benefit from hearing what you went through during your darkest hour okay well first let me say this to your dad okay if your dad I would say this when I went through my darkest hour I was absolutely convinced that I was in the pit of hell I was in the pit of deepest darkness there was no way out I was contemplating suicide I was thinking of killing myself I was inches away from the daylight I was steps steps away from the daylight everything was about to change everything was about to turn around my entire life since that moment has been a life of increasing joyfulness even in grief even in sometimes sorrow I you do not know where you are only God knows where you're standing so if you're in despair you might want to think about that the other thing is in your letter this is to you Yago in your letter you keep talking about what you're telling your father but you never talk about what he is telling you or whether you're listening to him and I wonder whether you're listening enough I wonder whether you're just letting him talk it really the most important thing you can do for someone who is suicidal is listen to them it's not tell them give them advice advice can always be gotten around in fact it gets to be almost a game that people in despair play with you is they play this game of soliciting advice from you so they can tell you why it won't work and that makes them feel in control and that makes them feel powerful instead of doing that why not just listen to them why not just hear what's hurting him and be there for him and tell him you love him and here's some and listen some more the more you listen the more you'll know the more he'll have an outlet for it and maybe he'll start to see where the trouble lies in ways that he doesn't see now I mean I feel that there's a lot of stuff you're not saying maybe you are listening but if you're not it's something that you should consider that really just having someone there to be with you and love you and accept you and listen to you is the most important thing that anybody who is near despair can have alright we'll end it there we're losing time you know I I don't know about you guys I'm already on vacation I mean it like is am I the only person who feels like this I'd like I realized at midnight last night oh wait you know I still have I still have to come in so let's go to tickety-boo news I just wanted to point out but there is I want one of those flags you know Austin just draws he doesn't give me the fun you know I noticed this little story the Food and Drug Administration it's really hard to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration it always bugs me for instance when they have something that treats a fatal disease and they say it may be unsafe and I think you're already dying it's right thing so they're very obsessive about not giving approval but they have approved a groundbreaking gene therapy that treats a rare form of blindness now there's there's all kinds of troubles with this is very rare there's only a couple of thousand people in the United States who have this form of blindness and the treatment itself they're talking about charging a million dollars for it and part of their logic is that sight is so valuable that we should be able to charge you for giving you your sight back and that has a conversation for another day the drug companies are really out of control and needs to be the way that drugs are licensed and the way they're sold around the world all of that needs to be looked at but but this is an amazing thing this is a genetic disease that destroys and they inject this into your eye and your eyesight comes back you know Jesus said that if you believe in me you will do miracles even greater than mine and a lot of people look at that and they say you know that really means that the world that is transformed by the presence of Christ is going to do these miracles and those things are starting just looking very quickly because I'm out of time but looking very quickly at some of the news this year that doesn't get reported researchers at MIT and UC Berkeley have figured out how to pull water out of the air and this is water that has humidity as low as 20% I mean this is amazing that's a revolutionary thing in the same way that the food the Green Revolution of the 60s and 70s made it possible for our population to grow and keep feeding people this means that people in places where there's not enough water will have enough water Hyde Harvard University science has figured out how to turn hydrogen the lightest of all elements into a metal this is a feat that has been studied by researchers for a hunt nearly a hundred years it could revolutionize the world because the the properties of metallic hydrogen could lead to faster supercomputers levitating railways and advanced advances an energy that could literally power rocket ships deep into our solar system it's amazing stuff they've made huge steps in growing human organs in pigs and regenerating human organs programming your body to regenerate human organs think of all our veterans who have lost limbs who might help by that it's an amazing world and of course this one thing that keeps that I keep thinking about is they've got a smartphone heart monitor I went I had to go and get scans the other day which all turned out to be great thank God but you know it was amazing it was amazing I said I lay down on his table for a minute a thing passed over me it wasn't that thing where they stick your head in an oven you know so you feel like you're suffocating you know it's like this thing passed over me and they said yep you're okay you know you just think wow I'm glad I live in this world instead of the world where like they say oh by the way you're dead you know we didn't know anything was wrong with you but now you're dead sorry you know it's like so remember all this as they're peddling all the hysteria and all the craziness and all the sadness and sorrow and the world is ending because they cut your taxes in the world is ending because of net neutrality and the world is ending because we're out of the Paris record the world's not ending and
