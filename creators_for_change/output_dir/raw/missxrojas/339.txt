2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,090
stage in our relationship where I can

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,009
sit here<font color="#E5E5E5"> 21 years of age sitting</font>

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,109
slightly on top of my stuffed Winnie the

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,599
Pooh eating green pasture out of my

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,250
Dalek mug but the Dalek mug is

7
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,540
appropriate for today's topic of

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,190
conversation today I want to talk about

9
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,260
dr. you as some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you may know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,910
from this website<font color="#CCCCCC"> crew mutinies calm</font>

11
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,350
I've written a number of immediate

12
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,090
reaction post to the recent episodes of

13
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,160
Doctor Who my opinions haven't been

14
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,410
positive really it whatsoever have been

15
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,000
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> or two bits of each episode that</font>

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,560
I've really<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoyed but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it really is</font>

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,210
isolated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I have</font>

18
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:37,800
a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question do you think</font>

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,510
you've outgrown Doctor Who implies one

20
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,070
of a few things to me about the person

21
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,899
who's asking it the first and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

22
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:43,920
the most important one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,539
implication that kids writing is

24
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,430
supposed to be sloppy or it's okay if

25
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,620
kids are itunes bad not we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

26
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,840
kids the highest<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> variety not</font>

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,980
that we should give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them the highest</font>

28
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,020
form<font color="#E5E5E5"> of entertainment highest form of</font>

29
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,090
storytelling not that they deserve that

30
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,129
audience but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

31
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:00,750
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids writing it's bad when you go</font>

32
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,520
up when he got out<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like that's the</font>

33
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,930
real stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> as some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who's read and</font>

34
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,339
recommended children's books with past

35
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,260
five years when I really resent that

36
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,970
there are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many fantastic books out</font>

37
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,320
there that were written<font color="#E5E5E5"> for children but</font>

38
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,560
can be fabulously enjoyed by adults and

39
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,909
completely but to rest a stupid idea

40
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kids writing is lesser than anyways</font>

41
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,990
and writing adults although the head

42
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,490
writers of Doctor Who in recent years

43
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,409
have both been men waiting for children

44
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,759
such as in fiction tends to be

45
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,229
associated with women but wonder whether

46
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,280
that has anything to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

47
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,659
perception of kids writing being

48
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,820
inferior to a dog wedding the second

49
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,110
part of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that question i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

50
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,180
really asks house again a lot to do with

51
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the previous thing that I just said</font>

52
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,090
there are people who think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the best</font>

53
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,670
mode of action is to go with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

54
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,290
stereotypes for children gender

55
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,479
stereotypes racial stereotypes and then

56
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,979
give them the faculties to challenge

57
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,649
those jokes later I only land this crazy

58
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,360
crazy thought that the earlier would

59
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,880
give children healthy ideas about gender

60
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,600
and race and wealth you know socio

61
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,430
economic situations before those

62
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,560
stereotypes form before their systems of

63
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,360
judgment are absorbed from other people

64
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,189
systems of judgment that surely will

65
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,630
create a healthier developmental

66
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,399
environment for the child and also just

67
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,840
make a better community the third thing

68
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people who try to get across when</font>

69
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,229
they ask me<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grew doctor who is</font>

70
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,960
that

71
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,850
because my opinion is invalid did I

72
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,140
should feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Club to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I</font>

73
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,790
feel about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> killers for example love</font>

74
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,500
it or leave it but just allowed people

75
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,390
to enjoy it first I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate that</font>

76
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,980
people have enjoyed episodes I've hated

77
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,140
that's always been the case I don't hate

78
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people who love the episodes that I</font>

79
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,620
hate equally I'm allowed to not like

80
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,420
things and to express that opinion on

81
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,400
tumblr on opinion forums or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the</font>

82
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,410
website that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> helped run and it really</font>

83
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,120
is only because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> better episodes</font>

84
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,920
it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I care so much because</font>

85
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,900
I love this program so much i love<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

86
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,100
actors so much and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i find it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

87
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,900
disappointing when they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

88
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,580
show that they deserve saving me it's

89
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a case of having outgrown Doctor Who</font>

90
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,870
it's a case of wanting it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

91
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,610
and wanting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be higher quality</font>

92
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,200
regardless of the age of its audience

93
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,790
and I actually think the more years I've

94
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,530
invested in it the more accurately I

95
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,050
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> personally that I can assess it</font>

96
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,520
when it's doing well and when it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

97
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,560
doing well again that's my personal

98
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,330
assessment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not me saying oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

99
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be everyone's assessment so yeah</font>

100
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,340
those are my thoughts now<font color="#CCCCCC"> a baitcaster</font>

101

<font color="#E5E5E5">me big questions for friday in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>
