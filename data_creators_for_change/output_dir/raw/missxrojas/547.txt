1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great thing happened when my</font>

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,480
opened I<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe sat down to make my video</font>

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,130
then completely forgot what I was gonna

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">make my video about and still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hadn't</font>

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,099
remembered because we r memory is like

6
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,830
dory fighting Nemo it is short term<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,349
then it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes like that speaking of</font>

8
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,059
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should watch the Pixar story</font>

9
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,660
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> woolly extras DVD because I have</font>

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,490
I don't know I haven't cried<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much</font>

11
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,650
majors and that's really saying

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,570
something and now i'm gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pixar spring</font>

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,539
that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love pizza it's my youth</font>

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,460
so instead I'm just going to talk about

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,020
books because it's what I do by default

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,700
you know how when you learn a new word

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,719
then you just hear it mentioned

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,360
constantly every way that you read it

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,910
the radio you hear it in songs here and

20
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,370
talk shows and random people use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,649
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vital core of a subject or</font>

22
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,480
lighting school and you're like I've

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,160
never heard this word before and then

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,780
all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's everywhere for me</font>

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,030
it's kind of been like that with an idea

26
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,030
and that idea is about our consciousness

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,969
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we perceive other people and</font>

28
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,909
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can ever truly really</font>

29
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,619
connect with anyone else really it was

30
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,729
Paper Towns yes but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

31
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,030
made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> think more about how how we</font>

32
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,460
perceive other people and again whether

33
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,830
we can ever properly connect with

34
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,470
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it made me think about</font>

35
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,159
looking for alaska on that way and then

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,109
sup<font color="#CCCCCC"> Katherine's in that way and they're</font>

37
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:27,729
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and it's just been an</font>

38
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:28,810
idea was well it's just popping up

39
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,069
everywhere literature and I've come to a

40
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:31,600
conclusion that it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a major</font>

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,369
general theme of literature that I've

42
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:35,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">been completely blind to because no one</font>

43
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,509
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> Julian opened my eyes to it so</font>

44
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:39,340
yeah but I want you to read a cup of

45
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,229
extracts from chrome yellow the book

46
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,609
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been mentioning in everything</font>

47
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of my videos but probably about</font>

them in his own eyes he had defects but

you see them was a privilege reserved to

concretely symbolized they represented

all the vast conscious world of men

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,069
outside himself they symbolize something

that other people should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in their way</font>

as elaborate and complete as he in his

impossible and yet periodically he would

97
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:34,539
make some painful discovery about the

98
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,940
external world<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the horrible reality</font>

of it

consciousness and its intelligence the

it put beyond a doubt the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outer</font>

individual he began in a soft and sadly

111

self-supporting universe there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

113
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,010
when he comes into contact with other

114
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,840
individuals when he is for to take

115
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,430
cognizance of the existence of other

116
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,310
universes beside himself true said Mary

117
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,130
and generalizing for herself she added

118
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,680
when one individual comes into intimate

one is apt Dennis went on to be so

123
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,560
spellbound by the spectacle of one's own

124
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,150
personality that one forgets that the

125
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,440
spectacle presents itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> to other</font>

126

not listening the difficulty she said

128

she avoids contact she received equally

grave sufferings that follow on

135
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,310
unnatural repressions as you see it's a

136
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,020
dilemma but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think of my own que ser</font>

137
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,760
Denys make you more decided move in the

138
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,770
desired direction I'm amazed how

139
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,389
ignorant I am of other people's

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentality in general and above all and</font>

141
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,280
in particular of their opinions about

myself our<font color="#E5E5E5"> minds are sealed Brooks only</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">occasionally open to the outside world I</font>

144
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,720
find it really ironic almost and you

145
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,460
know dennis is to him that consciousness

146
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,960
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble that we have and how</font>

147
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,669
narrow-minded of your and how we are so

148
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,760
selfish inherently selfish and

149
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,780
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do and it's he's</font>

150
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,389
proving himself just because Mary's

151
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:38,820
suffering horribly and she's so upset

152
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,430
and she's so torn and depressed and sad

153
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,630
dennis is sitting that quantification

154
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,820
about this like

155
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,320
illumination that he's had in this

156
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,190
realization tlie he had that he's not

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,690
the most important person in the world

158

red notebook I just I really loved it

160
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,400
and but as I said you know consciousness

161
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,260
has been popping up everywhere and it's

162
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,420
been it's been a really interesting it's

163
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,830
been really good fun I've been making a
