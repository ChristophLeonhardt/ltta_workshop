1
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,254
"CBC Radio One, 89.3-FM, 990-AM."

2
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:50,670
"Nice to hear the kids on the
first day back to school

3
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,650
Day 2 on the cycle in the
Winnipeg downtown.

4
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,400
It’s nine degrees.

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,050
At the airport it’s just two."

6
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:03,560
[singing] "O Canada, we
stand on guard for thee.

7
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:12,326
O Canada, we stand
on guard for thee."

8
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,370
"All right.

9
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,060
Good morning, everyone.

10
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,860
E.A.L. and learning how to
speak and practice English

11
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,670
is a big part of
why you’re here.

12
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,520
And so it’s the
first day of school.

13
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,620
Sometimes it’s a
little bit challenging."

14
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,240
"No.

15
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,216
Oh my God."

16
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:53,876
"Hi.

17
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:54,376
Welcome.

18
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:55,096
Come on in.

19
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:56,570
How are you?

20
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,310
Good.

21
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,816
Come on in.

22
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:01,110
Well, I think what
I’d like to do

23
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,002
to get started is to give
you a little questionnaire

24
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,380
to fill out.

25
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,755
The first question says, 'Do
you have brothers or sisters

26
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:13,740
and if so, how many?'"

27
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,950
"Do you want a break?"

28
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,450
"O.K."

29
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,865
"Do you want to take a
break and try again?

30
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:50,831
Looks good."

31
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,850
"So are you going to start
stretching more at home?"

32
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,500
"I will try."

33
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,000
"Yeah?"

34
00:05:03,857 --> 00:05:05,940
"Because it’s better if you
do it every day, right?"

35
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,428
"Mm."

36
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:07,928
"One."

37
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:11,407
"O.K."

38
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,000
"Hi.

39
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,760
My name is Sara.

40
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,070
My [inaudible] number is 85002.

41
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,222
I’ll be your interpreter.

42
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,120
How may I assist you?"

43
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,940
"I’m treating Suleiman’s
son for physiotherapy,

44
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,570
and I was wondering if
you’d be able to interpret

45
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,770
a question that he has for me."

46
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,400
"Yeah, sure."

47
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:05,805
"What are the chances that the
leg is going to get longer?"

48
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:18,802
"So is there like a hope that
maybe 10%, 50% of the leg

49
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:20,490
would get longer?"

50
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,420
"I don’t think so.

51
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,520
The orthopedic surgeon
would be a better person

52
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,740
to ask about the
long-term bone growth."

53
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,270
"Thank you very much to the
interpreter and to you."

54
00:08:07,515 --> 00:08:09,980
[school bell ringing]

55
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,924
"Good afternoon [inaudible].

56
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:18,710
All students should be in
their afternoon classes."

57
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,250
"Mustafa al [inaudible].

58
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,570
Not here yet.

59
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,540
Ibraheem?

60
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,040
Ibraheem?"

61
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,300
"Ibraheem, yes."

62
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,520
"Ibraheem.

63
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,760
What is the word we would use
to describe big countries?"

64
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,073
"Huge?"

65
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:37,270
"How do we measure big?"

66
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,409
"I don’t know, America."

67
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,240
"There’s a word called area.

68
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,919
Do you know what area is?"

69
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,419
"Yeah."

70
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,890
"So area is a
measurement of size.

71
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,780
So when we talk about
Canada being big,

72
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,930
there’s a lot of
area, a lot of space."

73
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,960
"But there is no people."

74
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,860
"In Canada."

75
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,210
"Only 30 millions, yeah."

76
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,630
"So we’re the second biggest
country in the world.

77
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,310
Shouldn’t that mean that we’re
the second most populated?"

78
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,176
"What words do you know
to describe family?

79
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,701
If you just raise
your hand and tell me.

80
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:41,200
Yes?"

81
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,210
"Like a tree."

82
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,650
"So like a tree."

83
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,200
"You can work on this, Ibraheem,

84
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,560
10 things about your family.

85
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,690
O.K.?

86
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,730
If that’s too hard, and I
understand that that might be,

87
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,420
you can just leave this alone.

88
00:10:01,420 --> 00:00:00,000
O.K.?"
