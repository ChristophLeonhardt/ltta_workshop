so everybody's talking about trade wars and trade deficits what do people get wrong about trade deficit I wrote a piece actually on my LinkedIn blog a few weeks ago called my trade deficit with Costco I think it's a really it's a good way of looking at this I wrote trade deficit Costco I buy a lot of their stuff they don't seem to want to buy what I have to sell which is basically investment insight but I run a trade deficit with almost everybody I run a trade deficit with Whole Foods I run a trade deficit with CVS the only people that I run a trade surplus with are JPMorgan Chase my employer but that's actually okay because overall I run a run a trade surplus and I don't really care who I run the trade deficit with so I think that's the first thing you know we focus on we've got it we've got a real problem with China we got a problem with Jeremy he doesn't matter so long as it overall we run a trade surplus we wouldn't have a problem but of course we don't but then that gets the second point you know why do I run a trade deficit with Costco or why do I you know why do people get into problems in which they're buying a lot of things from one group and and not selling them it's because I overspent and as a nation we overspend the reason we have a trade deficit is actually because we have a budget deficit if you think about it this way you go to the private sector you've got the public sector your trade if the private sector more or less pays its way if we if we fund our investments our savings but if the government runs a big budget deficit if it spends a whole pile more that's taking in taxes then we as a nation will live beyond our means I think this is so important it's not a matter of tariffs it's not a matter of the dollar if we run a big trade or budget deficit if we continue to buy more stuff the government does and it takes it in taxes we will run a trade deficit so if we want to fix our trade problem we've got to start by fixing the budget deficit and to take your analogy further if when is it okay to run a budget deficit or a trade deficit as an individual another foreign nation it's actually a very good point because they you know now I suppose I do overall I run a trade surplus and that and that's good but you know 20-30 years ago it was a younger man I actually ran a trade deficit I was borrowing money every year just to fund my expeditions to Costco because I wasn't getting paid enough but that's ok because I knew that over time I'd get paid more and that's actually true for example emerging market economies it's OK for them to borrow a whole pile of money to grow their economies it doesn't because they're young they've got plenty of room to grow we are an old mature economy our economic growth is going to be 2% in the long run in this kind of economy and with so many people retiring we actually should be running a budget surplus and a trade surplus we should be storing up money to pay for our retirement and of course we're doing exactly the opposite
