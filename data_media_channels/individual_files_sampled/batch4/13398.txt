we have a lot to get you today lena dunham lies again we're going to get to the special counsel apparently opening a grand jury we're going to talk about Jeff Sessions the Attorney General looking to crack down on leakers we'll get to all of that this is Ben Shapiro and this is Ben Shapiro shadow all right so we do have a lot to get you today I want to get to all of the stuff that's really in the news the kind of main news of the day but the best story of the day is this story about Lena Dunham and I would just be remiss if I didn't lead off with it because it is so grand and so glorious and she is such a terrible person in every way this of course is Lena Dunham the wildly unattractive star of girls the reason that I point out that she's wildly unattractive is because she has said in the past that if you find her wildly unattractive it's because you're sexist um no it's because you have eyes so Lena Dunham apparently she's lied about a bunch of things in the past she said in the past the the star girl she campaigned with Hillary Clinton she has said in the past that she was raped by a Republican named Barry not true she has said that she did not abandon her dog she just was was given a dog that had a history of being abused also not true and now her latest story her latest iteration in her stupidity cycle comes courtesy of American Airlines on Thursday Dunham tweeted that she over to American Airlines employees speaking about how they believe that the transgender agenda was terrible for children horror shocked no they must be stopped it's just too terrible she tweets out late last night quote at this moment of in history we should be teaching our employees about Rove and inclusivity American air that was worse part of this night everything that she does is always about the drama right ugh this the worst thing that ever happened is she the worst part of the night I can't I can't handle it and American Airlines row back you have us concern please meet us in DMS with your record locator in details what they really should have said is you have a concern please see a psychologist as soon as humanly possible and then she started DMing with them and here's what she said quote hi I heard two female attendants walking talking about how trans kids are trend they'd never accepted trans child and trans mrs. grose I think it reflects badly on uniformed employees of your companies you have that kind of dialogue going on what if a trans teen was walking behind them it starts at home but jobs can set standards of practice thanks for your consideration so in other words there are two women walking along talking about when the hottest issues of the day trans children right kids who believe that they are member of the opposite sex and these women were saying I would not accept it if my child said that they were a member of the opposite sex which is perfectly rational since you shouldn't really accept that because your child is not a member of the opposite sex you wouldn't usually look for treatment and this idea that as a parent you should accept this new idiocy voiced Adhan Americans by leftist society it's just dumb all the way through but she says big sister Lena Dunham no big sister the one who said the cheetah ones pleasure to herself next to 11 year old sister so she's not just big brother she's big sister and the best kind of big sister big sister reports that to American Airlines what if someone had been walking behind them someone was and she was a terrible person so she reported that and then she said I wasn't flying American this is a JFK and I was in a terminal with American attendants an American wrote back do you know what gate this was at she said I was in the arrivals hall coming from gate b32 baggage by the Hudson News across from the wine bar okay Stalin my god just reporting people for having normal conversation in the hallways at JFK like this is what this has come to now it wasn't manifesting in their behavior toward trans people it wasn't manifesting and how they treated any of the trans customers it wasn't manifesting in anything even assuming all of this is true they said thanks for the info Lena we're passing this along to our team to review and she wrote back thank you and then she wrote hash tag across from the wine bar so now we're now like targeting and tracking down anyone who has wronged think I mean this is Orwellian garbage Orwellian garbage number one these women can say whatever they like even if they've been saying stuff that was really anti-semitic do you think that I've gone to American Airlines and said you have these two vicious anti-semites working for you're like get over it get over it it's a free country you may think that people are terrible that doesn't give you the excuse to destroy their jobs as I said you know on Sunday which is aq a as I said if it's not impacting how they do their job it makes no difference okay then there's a big and then she tweeted for those who followed my airport saga yesterday here's my takeaway these days it's the little things a smile offering a seat respect you mean the little things like not getting people fired because you're a giant douche bag a human being like that it's like the little things like not targeting random passers-by who happen to disagree with you on a hot political issue of the day I mean God heavens forfend if they had said they voted for Trump I mean my god then Lena Dunham really would have would have reported them to American Airlines except there's one extra wrinkle to this story as always american airlines checked out the story and on friday they told Fox News quote we always look into complaints from customers but at this time we are unable to substantiate these allegations so there is no evidence that any of this happened at all and Lena Dunham once again is just saying crap because this is what Lena Dunham does to get attention leftist I never give you advice because I want you to continue to be a giant fail but here's a piece of advice stop associating with nut cases like Lena Dunham if you want people to take you seriously number one having your little emissaries going around and reporting people in USSR East Bloc Stasi fashion when they say things you don't like that's gross enough having them lie about it or say it without evidence is really really super gross and at this point the fact that the left continues to hang on to to Lena Dunham just like to hang on to Linda Sarsour it's just a monstered with the fact that they don't care about middle America they don't care about people who disagree they want the heroes that they want and it doesn't matter if those people are garbage heaps those people must be upheld it doesn't matter that Lena Dunham is a personal dumpster fire they're going to continue to label her just the woman of the year amazing amazing stuff but that's just another great story from the Lena Dunham annals of joy okay in other big news today bigger news obviously now there are a couple of big stories that are break from the first big story that is breaking is that attorney Jeff attorney general Jeff Sessions has now announced a broad crackdown on leaks now there's a lot of speculation that the reason that sessions is cracking down on the leaks is because you know the Trump is angry with him and so he is trying to please the President of the United States by cracking down on leaks the truth is he should be cracking down on leaks anyway we saw a very dangerous league yesterday when we saw that the Washington Post had run on the front-page story that was full transcripts from calls between President Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia as I said yesterday that is super dangerous stuff it doesn't matter that nothing really important was said in those transcripts what had happened if there had been something important that kind of stuff should not be made public especially because America's enemies are looking for the inside scoop on what exactly Trump is telling our allies and our enemies so that stuff is really bad obviously sessions should be looking for the leaks here's what Attorney General Sessions had to say today first let me say that I strongly agree with the president and condemn in the strongest terms the staggering number of leaks undermining the ability of our governments to protect this country just yesterday we saw reports in the media about conversations the President had with foreign leaders no one is entitled to surreptitiously fight to advance battles in the media by revealing sensitive government information no government can be effective when its leaders cannot discuss sensitive matters in confidence or talk freely in confidence with foreign leaders okay and then if you continue that everything was he saying there is exactly correct but it's the latter part of what he said that is a bigger problem so he now says that he is going to start targeting media sources for subpoenas about their sources he actually accused the media of getting people killed so he talked about this in a long statement as prepared for release he said we are here today to talk about the dramatic growth in the number of unauthorized disclosures of classified national security information in the past several months this includes leaks to both the media and in some cases even unauthorized disclosures to our foreign adversaries referrals for investigations of classified leads to the DOJ from our intelligence agencies have exploded in the first six months of this administration goj has already received nearly as many criminal referrals involving unauthorized disclosures of classified information as you received in the last three years combined this of course is because they're a bunch of Obama holdovers who are leaking everything they can get their hands on obviously that's criminal activity it is also true that President Trump should have moved much more quickly to clear these bureaus and put in members of his own staff it's ridiculous to leave in place all these obama holdovers it's one of the main failures of his administration he says furthering this goal we are here to announce some of the steps being taken and underway by the national insider threat task force to ensure this government's first priority to protect this country and her citizens is not undermined by the very people who have been entrusted to pursue this and then he talked specifically about what he was going to do with regard to the media he said that the media had basically got people killed he said I've listened to career investigators and prosecutors about how to most successfully investigate and prosecute these matters at their suggestion one of the things we are doing is reviewing policies affecting media subpoenas we respect the important role the press plays and will give them respect but it is not unlimited they cannot place lives at risk with impunity we must balance their role with protecting our national security and the lives of those who serve in our intelligence community of the Armed Forces and all law-abiding Americans that's some pretty harsh stuff and it's some pretty heavy stuff and I think that it's worthwhile discussing it for just a second first of all should the media be printing stuff that actually puts American national security at risk of course the media should not be doing that but the media very often at least the Washington Post in Yorktown from reading they tend to take a general level of care with national security information so as not to reveal stuff that would actually put people in harm's way in fact the most obvious example that comes to mind in the last six months is there was that New York Times report about how Trump had spilled classified information to the Russians in that oval office meeting behind closed doors with certain Gekas lyac and the Russian ambassador and Sergey Lavrov the Foreign Minister of the Russia's of the Russians and and if you recall the New York Times actually said that they were not going to print some of the material because they thought that it would hurt national security then Trump promptly went out and basically blew that wide open by omission by saying exactly what it was that he had said putting an Israeli national security asset at risk the media obviously has to be careful about what it leaks if somebody leaks to you that we are the new nuclear codes to give the most obvious example and the New York Times print the nuclear codes obviously that would be something that falls into the realm of endangering American national security but we have to be very careful just because we like attorney general sessions or the Trump administration we still have to be careful about the idea that the press can be cracked down upon to reveal their sources just because the Trump administration doesn't like it or an Obama administration doesn't like it I didn't like it when Obama did this Obama famously prosecuted leakers he also went after particular news sources that were involved in in in releasing the information from the Lakers this is dangerous stuff we do want a high level of transparency when it comes to American government obviously if you're working for you shouldn't be leaking but going to press outlets and trying to force them to reveal their sources because you don't like the information there's a very thin line between trying to protect national security and going after press outlets because you just don't like the information that's being leaked and I'm not sure how much to trust the Department of Justice with drawing that line in a relevant and decent way I want to talk a little bit more about that I also want to talk about the big breaking news obviously which is a robert muller who's the special counsel has now appointed a grand jury i want to tell you what that means from a legal perspective before i get to that i want to tell you about the united states concealed carry Association so last week in Las Vegas a woman was beaten nearly and just beating the crap out of her boyfriend when she went to flee she was followed by her attacker in the ensuing chaos a bystander intervened and shot the guy saving her life eliminating the threat to the community but when the cops showed up they did what they're supposed to do they arrested the bystander he's arrested for being good Samaritan this is the all too common reality for people brave enough to defend themselves and others and it's not the fault of the cops and it's not your fault but you could get caught up in a situation where you are now being criminally prosecuted or investigated simply for using a gun in self-defense this is why you need the u.s. CCA you SEC is an invaluable resource for armed Americans before during and after a self-defense incident and they know the police aren't always able to make a judgment call immediately following the event sometimes the law just precludes that that means that even if you're involved in a self-defense incident a pretty good chance you'll be arrested well an investigation is concluded even if you're innocent so don't leave your future up to chance go to defend my family now comments defend my family now calm to discover what the US ETA can do for you right now as an extra bonus new members are automatically entered to win a free guns so not only will they provide you all the information for after a shoot and get you information about training with the gun you can even win a free gun when you go to defend my family now calm defend my family now calm and the details are all over there it's been my family now calm that particular deal and soon go check it out defend my family now calm again you don't want to be caught in a situation we're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal bills and three years in legal system without knowing what it is you're in for that's why you need the u.s. ECA and that's why you ought to go look them up and defend my family now calm okay so the other big story of the day is this breaking news that the Special Counsel Robert Muller has no impact exactly does that mean what means a couple of things Andrew McCarthy over at National Review who's been all over this he says this is officially a criminal investigation now you don't impanel a grand jury for a counterintelligence investigation grand juries are essentially it's a group of jurors who are set up in order so that they can issue subpoenas for documents and testimony with the power of law that's what a grand jury does it doesn't necessarily mean that the grand jury is going to indict but you set up the grand jury so that they have the power to compel testimony and the power to compel documentation the next logical step is in indictments if they find some elements of guilt now what is this grand jury actually going to do well it's not going to be investigating Mike Flynn so Mike Flynn the former national security adviser there's already a grand jury that's been impaneled in Virginia to check out Mike Flynn which suggests that there are other people who are now in the line of Robert Muller's fire according to CNN federal investigators explore and whether Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Russian spies have seized on Trump and his associates financial ties to Russia as one of the most fertile avenues for moving the probe forward according to people familiar with the investigation so there are a lot of people on the right right now who are legitimately saying I think this is correct that this investigation has now broadened beyond collusion they can't prove collusion and so now they're looking for other criminal activity that is not within the scope of the investigation it's not within the scope of the investigation and Trump is now stuck between a rock and a hard place because if Muller exceeds the scope of his investigation if he's no longer just required to restrict it to Russian collusion now it looks like he's just looking for criminal activity every which way he's just looking at every nook and cranny for criminal activity and that would be an excuse just to get Trump out of office by the Democrats now if Trump fires Muller is going to look like he's trying to obstruct something if he doesn't fire Muller there's a good shot that mode comes up with the prosecution of some ancillary official in the Trump campaign and the Democrats use that as a brickbat in order to Club Trump into submission it's a rock and a hard place again this is why it was such a mistake for Trump to get a special counsel appointed in the first place it was it was his own fault if you recall back to the firing of James Comey the only reason the special counsel was appointed in the first place is because the Attorney General had already recused himself on Russia the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had not but Trump used rod Rosenstein as an excuse to fire Comey and then Comey leaked out that the the Trump had basically threatened him at least according to call me and then Rosenstein was now implicated in this whole thing and then Trump went on national TV and said he really fired Comey because of the Russia thing using rod Rosenstein as cover and forcing Rosenstein to recuse himself and appoints a special counsel so Trump is stuck between a rock and a hard place according to CNN the FBI is reviewing financial records related to the Trump Organization as well as Trump his family members including Trump jr. and campaign associates they've combed through the list of shell companies and buyers of Trump pretended real estate properties scrutinized the roster of tenants at Trump Tower reaching back more than a half dozen years this is exactly the kind of stuff strum said he didn't want if you recall back to New York Times interview two weeks ago from said if Muller starts looking into financial impropriety then maybe I'll fire him which would trigger not a constitutional crisis but certainly a major constitutional conflagration again it's not a constitutional crisis because there means to deal with it but it would certainly create a firestorm it would look a lot like Nixon trying to fire the special prosecutor in the middle of the Watergate investigation and again Trump could do this even if he's completely innocent but it would just look bad Trump attorney Jay Sekulow is openly stating now that there's no reason to think Trump is under investigation and an inquiry from the special counsel that moves beyond the mandate might be a reason to fire him this is not a surprise because the impaneling of a grand jury in situations like this when you've got an investigation is typically how they move forward that that's it is really very much a standard operating procedure when you've got a situation like this but with respect to the impaneling of the grand jury we have no reason to believe the president's under investigation here okay so there they're suggesting still that their separation with Trump and this is true I mean we don't have any information that's not sure the problem is that seculow has had credibility problems in the past just in the last week it was revealed that Donald Trump was intimately involved in the crafting of Donald Trump jr. statement about the Russian meeting from 2016 and Sekulow had gone on national TV and said as you recall that Trump had not been involved in the drafting of that statement so there's credibility problems all the way across the board this is going to be a thing that just dogs the Trump administration and this is the problem you know because Trump kept talking about it because there all these leaks coming out and the leaks are truly egregious you know Special Counsel should not be leaking because of all this it's just a dark cloud on the Trump horizon that he can't seem to get rid of and if you fire smaller then that actually accelerates now the media of course have been have been suggesting that this is the be-all end-all now there's a grand jury that means Trump is going down a lot of wishful thinking in the media and it's driven the left a little bit nutty to the point where they now suggest that Trump was intimately involved that he was in bed with Vladimir Putin again without evidence I thought the Kelly uncomely did a good job on CNN pointing this out in this case now again I think people are just talking about an investigation that exists but looking for collusion and conclusions that don't exist and I like the fact that CNN took about almost a full week off slinking away from covering the Russian so-called investigation and because you know that the polls say that six percent of American states the most important issue to them but that is consumed 75 percent of the coverage so I do think Americans are owed full coverage of all the issues they say effect in the economy jobs health care certainly national security and the like and I hope that your network will continue to do that well you know we try to cover everything that matters and sometimes yeah I'll kind of see Kellyanne there shellacking a piece of wood Chris Cuomo who is a living embodiment of a tree he must think of him when he was in high school and we need someone to play the tree Chris step forward and he plays a fantastic oak pine is mediocre but his oak is just absolutely terrific so well done Kelly on calmly this is the problem with it with the media on all of this is that the media have declared that every element of the case means the Trump is guilty doesn't matter what happens the conclusion is Trump is guilty the grand jury doesn't mean the Trump is guilty it doesn't even mean that we know that anything is wrong here's what we do know at this point apparently CNN is saying the investigation is focusing on four key figures it's exactly who you would have thought exactly who you were thought and who I've been saying for months we're going to be the people who are involved right if there if there was involvement Paul Manafort who is always in bed with the Russians okay they're suggesting now that Paul Manafort was being targeted because investigators had found conversations among alleged Russian operatives regarding Manta forts attempts to encourage help for the campaign from the Russians that would be the collusion that people are talking about with Manta fort Trump has a good answer to that which is I found out about it I fired man afford the problem is that he didn't just say that up front he should have just said that up front and and then he would be in the clear a Carter Paige who's a foreign policy adviser Trump is under investigation apparently he's done under FISA surveillance since 2014 which means there's lots of records of his conversations and of course Roger stone the political operative who's very close to the Trump campaign does any of this mean that Trump is guilty no it doesn't mean that any of it doesn't mean the Trump is guilty and if you're actually going to find evidence then let's see the evidence but I think that it is a it is a problem for the for the Trump administration to suggest that nothing is wrong and it's a problem for the media to suggest that everything is wrong I want to talk a little bit more about this plus Trump does something pretty great and it demonstrates the movement of the country that has not as much to do with Trump does the movement of the country toward a redder country in terms of the map but

who's a guy named Justice that's really his his actual name is justice and he gem justice which is just a great comic book name but he's not look like a comic book character unfortunately that'd be awesome but he does not he looks like a governor from West Virginia and he was a Democrat he was a Republican that he was an independent then he was a Democrat and now he's converting back to being Republican is he's doing that because he has principled agreement with President Trump no he's doing that because West Virginia is turning red just like an enormous amount of the country is turning red there are just 15 Democratic governors in the entire nation at this point 15 in the nation with 50 states Republicans are dominant across the country why can't they get anything done you ask because they're stupid but here is Jim Justice declaring that he is now a Republican apparently his own staff didn't know they're going to be kind of disappointed but but here he is announcing his shift I've been to the Oval Office twice in the last two or three weeks I've been there to present an idea on coal and an idea on manufacturing I've had the great opportunity to be with our president now let me tell you just this I have to be really serious with you just a moment I have to tell you that the last session of our legislature I tried with all my soul okay so he's a he's obviously happy moving that direction because both houses of his legislature are Republican in West Virginia so it's now a United Republican dominated state in West Virginia so add another one to the Republican column as well and the he also paid homage to Trump which is what you probably have to do in West Virginia State the Trump I believe won by about forty three points image to blow out in West Virginia let me I'll have to check that but in any case he actually said there's nothing to this Russia stuff right anytime you're in Trump's presence you have to say there's nothing to the rush of stuff and just as sort of a points of homage and then Trump jumped on that bandwagon to again I'm not sure this is helping Trump's case too much you should really just be quiet and let everything take its course and then defend himself when the time comes but from decided to go up on the rush of stuff to prompting chance of you guessed it because we will never escape 2016 2016 is now the time loop we can never escape 2016 is a black hole of human time we will forever be sucked into its maw reliving the death of Harambee over and over and over as well as the 2016 election it's like Groundhog Day all over again it's time to chant lock her up the Russia story is a total fabrication it's just an excuse for the greatest loss in the history of American politics that's all over what the prosecutors should be looking at our Hillary Clinton's 33000 deleted emails they're all chanting lock her up I mean it's you know everybody's very enthusiastic about McGann we're never going to escape 2016 here's the thing until we escape 2016 we can't actually move forward with a Republican agenda instead we're just going to keep reliving this thing over and over and over and terms just going to keep talking about Russia as a distraction Russia is a distraction but the distraction isn't from Hillary Clinton okay the distraction is from your agenda I'd say listen we could be moving forward unpopular legislation that helps Americans accept the media and the Democrats keep focusing on what is a giant nothing burger they have yet to show a shadow of proof of actual collusion right instead we're going back to Hillary Clinton I understand this is a cheap throwaway line I understand listen if you want to learn Court and prosecuted because it's her knee general can do it but I don't see him ordering the Attorney General to reopen an investigation into Hillary Clinton because it's just another one of these throwaway lines okay so what this is causing with regard to Trump all of this is causing with regard to Trump people on the right to go to this place where everything that Trump does that is bad is justified by some of the things that Trump does that are good and on the left everything Trump does is awful and evil and terrible and garbagey and there's no in-between so Greg Gutfeld who has been at times a I think a rather well calibrated critic of President Trump's yesterday he's talking about how Trump lied about the Boy Scouts because you'd said that the Boy Scouts were were calling him to say that he's given the best speech ever and in Gutfeld basically says I don't really care if he lies if he gives us what we need about the rally itself is you can see how how Trump's persuasion works what he does there when all this other stuff is going on he focused on the everyday issues he brought up taxes crime drugs care jobs coal the Paris Accords these are things that are major concerns for people and what it does is it marginalizes by comparison the obsessions of the media whether it's about his language about his meetings about his bids about Jim comes off as superfluous irrelevant because all the people if you would up to somebody there and you said yeah but did you hear their impaneling they go I don't give a damn you know what I have a problem with oxy I got problems without you coded in my society I I'm glad he's destroying Isis bell ringing okay and so what after this is this is the right-wing line the right blue line has become I don't care about the Russia stuff because he's doing things that I want him to or at least talking about things that I want to do I have other concerns and the left-wing line is I don't care about Trump's other concerns or the people's other concerns because of the Russia stuff that Anna Navarro is line overrun on CNN here she is saying that yesterday the real story here is that you had the Prime Minister of Australia having to explain policy to him like you teach a four-year-old how to read a is for Apple B is for boy c is for cat the President of the United States was completely ignorant and clueless as to the policy that they were discussing it was crazy and using it was shameful I mean let me let me just say this and I've been saying this all along please do not gauge your level of political participation knowledge the stuff that you care about my president Trump if you're on the right don't gauge what he's doing wrong by what he's doing right and if you're on the Left don't engage what he's doing right by what he's doing wrong don't pretend that he's universally one way or another don't pretend everything he does is great don't pretend that his his sins are excused by his good deeds that's not how it works and on the Left don't pretend that the stuff that Trump is doing that some of what you like is is stuff that is somehow antithetical to the American Way because you don't like the rush of stuff instead where you put Trump aside and say okay what is he actually doing why don't we all try to do the same thing we all try to do the same thing at least we could exist in the same realm of fact the problem is we no longer even tell the same narratives you'll get the headlines at Huffington Post it's Trump lies about Boy Scouts and then you and Trump lies about Russia and then you however - Breitbart in the and and it's Trump succeeds in West Virginia with coal I mean it's like two separate worlds that you're living in and never the two shall make we have to keep both of those things in our mind if we're actually going to create I think a relatively reasonable and an objective and useful picture of the President of the United States and how well he is doing okay time for some things I like things I hate and that I want to do an extra special mailbag today so the thing I like today we've been doing Anthony Skinner Meucci all the way through the week this actually isn't a movie that I like a lot I don't like the movie very much but this is Anthony scaramouche in a nutshell I just I had a hard time by Nahum guys I mean I got to be real about this Anthony Skinner Meucci was my favorite character in Trump the series and it makes me really sad I mean just the way that I felt terrible after the red wedding and Game of Thrones and I just kept thinking god that was terrible what they did to Rob you know now I just think about Anthony Skinner motion I think what would he be doing with this news cycle you know w WASD what would Anthony Skinner Moochie do I you know I just think that every so often it makes me sad for it yeah I I said earlier in the week that we shouldn't mourn we should just be thankful for the time we had together with Nancy nice Cantor Moochie but you know some line that people say at funerals and then two days later they feel terrible because they remember the person's not there anymore that's how I feel about Anthony scaramouche you know every every few days I just think and I think back and I go man that guy that dude then Anthony Skinner Moche dude so this of course is from American Psycho the most the movie that I think most closely resembled Anthony Skinner Meucci it's not a great movie it's a cringe inducing horrifying moving christian bale plays this Wall Street guy who's a yuppie and has gotten sucked into the power games of yuppie dumb and then is driven totally mad by it he's associate pastor murderous people and he decides to murder this particular particularly guy has a nicer business card than he does and so he decides that it is relevant it is worthwhile to murder him while listening to Huey Lewis and the news it's been compared to Elvis Costello but I think here we have a far more bitter cynical sense of humor the average trip yes Alan why are the copies of the style of section we played you even dog Lou Chow or something ha ha no Alan is that a raincoat it is in 87 we really live for the most accomplished album I think the undisputed masterpiece to be where seong-chil - you most people probably go listen to the word but they should because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of friends it's also a personal statement about the band itself the movie itself is terrifying and insane and roll up at the end with the you don't know whether Christian Bale actually did any of things whether it was all in his head but I think that's that scaramouche in a nutshell everything is sort of over-the-top and crazy and he may be an axe murderer I just don't know enough about him at this point well maybe maybe one day we'll find out and you just don't know okay so time for some things I hate them we'll get to the mailbag okay so the first thing that I hate is a Colin Kaepernick's girlfriend came out yesterday Americana Kaepernick he's a guy who used to play quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers until he started becoming incredibly crappy became a second string quarterback and then decided to kneel for the national anthem cratering a lot of the NFL's ratings and in destroying a lot of their credibility with non black communities and I say that because the polls show that black Americans like the the national anthem stuff and non black Americans really didn't Hispanics and whites really didn't in any case Colin Kaepernick's girlfriend tweeted out that being a quarterback in the NFL was like being owned as a slave okay if that's if that is the way this works I mean I make myself a good living here but if that's slavery and boy sign me up because the slavery is being paid 100 million dollars like some of these quarterbacks I mean Colin Kaepernick sound like a 20 million dollar contract and he was an awful quarterback he's a garbage quarterback who couldn't read a play he couldn't even look you can't even check his secondary receiver my goodness and he's making millions of dollars his girlfriends weeded out that if you are warm with the owners of a team that's because they're like slave holders and you are like a house negro essentially Steven a Smith says that all that's happening here is the NFL was trying to silence future Colin Kaepernick's and of course be God the execrable Max Kellerman who I cannot stand the worst host in the history of mankind for any purpose ever okay Max Kellerman there's a show in LA a sports show in LA called Max and Marcellus it is legitimately the worst show in the history of humanity if satan could have crapped out a show it was down like Massa Marcellus it is the worst show ever so anyway would that ringing endorsement in his years here is Mack scalloped with Steven Naismith talking about how Colin Kapernick is obviously being victimized last point it goes deeper than that and here's why because far beyond the importance of winning what you're trying to do by keeping Colin Kaepernick out the game is not just silenced him but silenced all those aspiring to emulate Colin Kaepernick it's a dissuasive measure being exercised by League owners regardless of what they're willing to admit so if they way with this where Colin Kaepernick is kept out of the league and there is no noise that's reverberating then you know what they're going to succeed and suddenly you're going to hear a lot of folks being very very quiet and not speaking up about issues and that would be tragedy that's right I will just be tragedy if Colin Kaepernick couldn't kneel for the national anthem other people might think twice about kneeling for the national anthem that would certainly be tragic I mean not that there any consequences or anything to the NFL for for all of this but if we dissuade athletes like we're you know I don't know whether Steven Naismith was I honestly don't know where Steven Naismith was when it came to Curt Schilling basically being thrown off of ESPN for implying that Isis and the Nazis were part of the same sort of general mentality about Jews like I don't know where Steven Naismith was for that I don't know where Steven Naismith was Mike Ditka got kicked off the network for suggesting that he was going to vote for President Trump I don't know where Steven Naismith was when chris broussard was suspended because he said he wasn't personally in favor of same-sex marriage during the jason collins stuff but this idea that the distillation can only be practiced against the the right and that Colin Kaepernick should feel nothing like it you can't even disagree with him look if you're an NFL owner why would you put a guy who made himself wildly unpopular with NFL fans on your roster particularly when he sucks by the way I promise you that of Colin Kaepernick were really a terrific player he would still be playing in the NFL I promise you that right now okay I got criminals playing in the NFL perfect example Steve Nash right terrific point guard for the Phoenix Suns and it was with the Dallas Mavericks and then who is also with the with the LA Lakers briefly Steve Nash if you recall he's Canadian and during the Iraq war he refused to - put it hand over his heart for the American national anthem he wouldn't stand for the American national anthem exactly the same as Kaepernick during the Iraq war did he play again yeah because a good player so this idea that Kaepernick is not being hired because of his politics no Kaepernick is not being hired because he's not a good player the same way that you know for all talked about a Tim Tebow was not hired in part because of his politics but I think largely because it wasn't a very good player he was a much better player Tim Tebow would have been in the NFL still okay time for the mailbag so let's do that go rain right hey Ben how did you become so good at argumentation did you actively study it are you simply very well-informed on the topics you speak or both thanks well I think that arguing is a tactic you know debating is a tactic so number one you have to feel comfortable with your own positions really have thought them through thought the information for real really feel comfortable in debate and stick and move and be able to move with people that's that's the best way to be good at debating but you also have to study the debate tactics of the person against whom you're debating so when I debated chanc Weger I still remember names last name but Jin Cheng tiger over at over at poetic on on Sunday I had studied his previous debate I looked at how he had done it with an action and in the past actually the debate ended up being very different than those debates but I was prepared if he was going to go low I was prepared for how to counter that if you decided to do that so every debate you have to have a game plan for I would say that every every argument that you have in public you should have a game plan for Benjamin writes hey Ben I'm Ben well congratulations dude today I was scrolling through my Facebook and saw post and infuriated me the post read like this don't call transgender people mentally ill if you believe a man in the clouds loves you unconditionally but only under certain conditions the implication of course is that all religious people are mentally ill how would you respond to this things I would respond by saying that's ridiculous the reason that's ridiculous is because there's no evidence that religion is mental illness there is an it is a belief system ok people believe lots of things lots of people believe in secular human rights there is no basis for secular human rights ok it's based on your own logic my belief in God is based on my idea that there was a planner and creator for this universe and that God is intimately involved in the continuing in the continuing fate of man because I believe that people generally as a whole get what they deserve both here and in the afterlife and I can give you all the logical reasons why I believe that yeah I will we admit there are logical reasons that go the other way I think the only evidence-based position on God is agnosticism that's the only evidence-based position I'm God because I think that you can make a very solid evidentiary case for the presence of God the idea that there was a designer of this complex universe that would be nearly impossible to comprehend in in terms of random chance and also would be nearly impossible to comprehend in terms of why human beings would be able to grasp at the essence of the universe and uncover all of the secrets like why why don't we all just animals who basically move sticks around why is that so that's a good case for God freewill is the best case for God the idea that you can choose to do otherwise if you're a determinist and that's a good case for atheism right so I think there's evidence on both sides but but certainly a belief system is not the same as mental illness the reason that I say it is mentally ill to to the two if you are transgender is because you believe something that is objectively not true you're objectively not a woman if you are a man you're objectively not a man if you are a woman things have categories okay it is not objectively untrue that there is no God right I can believe lots of things and as far as it as far as you know what God wants of me I can believe that the system that God promulgated at Sinai and was then promulgated to the world through Christianity more broadly I can believe that that system of morality has led to the greatest civilization in the history of mankind by a wide margin and that's relatively good evidence for it's at least utilitarian value so again trying to link belief systems with mental illness again it's not objectively unverified it's not objectively verifiable that it is false judaism christianity or presence of god it is objectively falsifiable the you are a female if you are male okay that's that's the answer also if you want to talk about why it's mental illness again religion is linked to better mental health actually religious belief generally is linked to less depression West suicide what's drug use what's alcoholism higher degraded happiness transgenderism going to a 40 percent suicide led rate higher delay to a higher rates of STDs higher rates of not just suicide but but depression a higher rates of self-harm okay Adam says hey Ben Orthodox Jews believe in Jesus correct they don't believe he's the son of God though right did the Jewish religion believe he claims to be the Son of God if so isn't this blasphemy please clarify what type of person Jesus is in the eyes of the Jewish religion so or that actually believed that there was a Jesus and the Jesus existed historically speaking what we believe is that Jesus was another Jew and that he did not claim to be the Son of God that that was a later addition in the Christian Gospels because Paul is writing 40 years after the death of Christ and that's what he sees Jesus on the road to Damascus and that and that Jesus was essentially attempting to lead a rebellion against the Romans was killed for his trouble just like a lot of other Jews were killed for their trouble that's the Jewish take on Jesus obviously that's why we different right I think Jews and Christians don't believe the same things about Jesus John's has been with all this talk about health care why are we not talking about the health of Americans childhood obesity processed food diabetes heart disease we are fast food nation where and where when and where does the actual health of Americans come into the equation cheers John John such a good question so every time the web says that health care outcomes in the United States are lower than health care outcomes in places like Europe one of the answers is America is a very diverse place with people who eat lots of different things and have lots of different habits about exercise and the fact is that if you look at ethanol a similar populations in the United States and Sweden for example Tweety's people living in the United States they have exactly the same life expectancy as Swedish people living in Sweden so these two populations are not comparable and it's worthwhile noting that because otherwise you have a con founding statistic that's destroying the perception what health care is and what it does in the United States from Kyle says team urine or teams in Aris in in Game of Thrones I didn't know that you're on had a team although I am appreciating the goth rock you're on of this year and I'm enjoying his like rabid smiling at people that is that that's the thing I'm definitely not team Daenerys I find her to be an incredibly boring character highly incompetent to her at her job she has like she has a couple of jobs one be be good at outreach sucks at outreach terrible at outreach everywhere she's ruled has been garbage at outreach legitimately the only people who like her are slaves that she freed understandable but she's not exactly the queen of popularity then she's supposed to be this great war leader she blows as a war leader she's awful okay the strategy that she has undertaken in Game seven in season seven or Game of Thrones as promulgated by supposedly the wisest guy on the show Tyrion I don't know where Tyrion got this great reputation as an advisor I'm not seeing it dude like you in marine you were awful he was an awful advisor marine and now he comes to to Westeros and he's a similarly awful advisor again like seems like a nice guy but not really good at his job Daenerys is a terrible negotiator she's terrible at outreach she's terrible to military and she happens to be I'm sad to say a terrible actress so there is so so not good all the way through okay Kyle says hello Ben I always hear about how America is severely in debt to China is it's like owing money to a loan shark for a bad gambling trip kind of debt or is it more complex economic issue a brief synopsis would be great love the show so I think that people need to stop mixing up trade deficits with debt so the United States has a lot of debt to China that means that China has bought a lot of American bonds they bought a lot of American bonds because the United States has been financing its debt it's public debt right the things that we take out to pay for Social Security and Medicare we've been taking out a lot of that debt on the open market and China has been buying a lot of those bonds if trying to want it to sink the value of the United States dollar all they would do is kill our ability to actually borrow more money and the way they would do that is by reselling the bonds put the bonds on the open market flood the market with bonds and then that would inflate the value of the dollar right that's that's the danger of trying to owning our debt there are a lot of people who have this weird idea that because we buy lots of products from China that the debt that's not a debt okay when you buy a product from your local grocery store you don't owe a debt you just bought a product okay they made they made money off of you but you make the products off of them in fact the way that International Economics works if you spend a lot of money in China you're spending dollars can Chinese people in China spend dollars on other Chinese products no they don't use that these do Ron right so they actually would actually have to spend those dollars back in the United States what you've actually seen it's called it's called the capital surplus the United States with China has a trade deficit but a capital surplus meaning the China is investing much more in the United States than the United States investing in China this also happened with Japan in the 80s and it was freaked out we have a trade deficit because everybody's buying these cheap Japanese tape recorders oh no we're all going to die okay and turned out to Japan end up overtaking us as the leading world economy no they collapsed in the 1990s they're all buying American land American real estate they have we had a capital surplus with them trade deficits do not mean debt and trade deficits student mean that you are economically failing you know it's a country with the trade surplus right now really a country with a trade surplus Venezuela we talked about them earlier this week they've a trade surplus because they won't let anybody ship goods and services into their country what does that meant absolute poverty people shooting dogs in the streets to eat them okay Ben says hey been a lot of Ben's watching the show there's even another one in the mailbag Wow it says hey Ben I must ask in what order would you put God family country so as a religious person that's the order right God family country now what you hope for and what you hope to create is an absolute symbiosis between those three things right where there is no conflict where your country is not infringing on your capacity to worship God or your family which you are which you have worked to mold in a godly image is in countenance with the country this is why you need a free country that allows families to operate as they will and worship God as they see fit this is why freedom is necessary so when everything is in alignment these are not in conflict God family country but if you were to ask me you know if my family were to come into into conflict with the country which one would I choose I would choose my family because I mean it to be fair I don't know that that is even a hierarchy because it depends on the values bottom line is values or values so if my family was right outside with my family if the country is right outside with the country presumably but if you're saying that you know where do I think I have a more heavy stamp of my values obviously my family I have much more of a heavy stamp of my values on my family than I do on my country but if you know all that put aside this is true for everyone okay everyone values family over country which is why it's imperative that we stop breaking down into tribal groups and then using the government as a bat to club other people in the submission if we do that then you are going to have a conflict between country and family and that's going to get violent pretty quickly Ben says why are there legal issues presented upon an individual for using their firearm in a situation where it is needed doesn't that in one aspect two feet the purpose of owning a firearm is there a way to get the cement to ensure the full rights of our legal gun owners so yes so that you can violate some laws but not others in self-defense situation so for example this is why you know I'm not a big fan of gun laws if I owned an illegal firearm and somebody breaks in my house and is trying to hurt one of my children I shoot him I could be prosecuted for illegal use of a firearm even if I properly act in defensive solve for others that's why I don't like a lot of these gun laws and I think that they're really really stupid as far as why you would be arrested in a situation where you need to you seca that's just because the cops can't tell I mean if they walk in your house and they see a dead guy on the floor they don't know all the circumstances they have to arrest you first off just to ensure safety but you know obviously we hope and pray that in a decent legal system you are acquitted and not even prosecute in the first place I elk hunt on just says shabbat shalom okay well you too dude and enroll God says hey Ben how is it the progressive tax system was put into place isn't there something in the Constitution that says the government has to protect your property and not take it away just because that's what the collective decided yes so the fifth amendment of the Constitution of the United States has what people wrongly call the eminent domain clause okay this is the idea that the government cannot take away private property for public use without just compensation that's the exact language of the statute Richard Epstein has a really good book called takings in it he basically argues that if you look at that closely what that really means is the government can't take your money from you for public use without giving you an equal amounts of services in return so yes the in the income tax itself was unconstitutional the progressive income tax was unconstitutional the sixteenth amendment is the is the one that that legalized the income tax worst amendment in the US Constitution and and yes the constitutional framework never conceived of the idea of this massive private in this massive taxation of private wealth on a progressively sliding scale okay so we will be back here on Monday and I'm sure there will be much more news because the news never stops gang I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
