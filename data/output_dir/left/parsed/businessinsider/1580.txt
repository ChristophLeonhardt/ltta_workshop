the single largest threat to the global
economy is Europe Europe exports
deflation it exports crisis we are going
to have to become what China was 10
years ago only x 20 because we're a much
bigger economy than China was 10 years
ago so in other words we have to sell
sell sell to the rest of the world and
not buy from the rest of the world this
is exporting crisis exporting deflation
to the rest of the world if we succeed
in doing this we destroy the rest of the
world if we don't succeed in doing this
we are imbalanced so this is what I'm
saying Europe is a clear and present
danger for the world economy
