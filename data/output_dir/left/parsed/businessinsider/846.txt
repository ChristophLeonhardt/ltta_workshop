I had a chart is that chart around here
someplace did you have that I have to
show this chart to you because it's
amazing actually this is if you want to
build a highway in the United States
these are some of the permits that you
need it's a process that can take way
over ten years and it just never happens
then at the end of the period they vote
against it and we're getting rid of many
of these regulations you have to go
through 17 agents many permits in each
agency
