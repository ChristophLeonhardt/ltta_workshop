so it's interesting when you think about facial wrinkles or how do we look could a sleep position maybe influence that and the answer is yes it could especially if you sleep on one side every night and you stay on there for you know preponderance of the night well you do see is you see the face starts to push in a little bit also as we breathe out at night we breathe out almost a full liter of water and so our body B starts to become dehydrated the more dehydrated you are and the more that we're pushing on the skin the collagen fibers that are in the skin begin to crush and that can actually cause these little divots which eventually become wrinkles sleeping on your back is the healthiest position to be in why because your weight is distributed across your frame completely evenly when you're lying for example on your mattress like that
