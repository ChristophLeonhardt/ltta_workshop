00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:17,216
EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE.

5
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:19,952

17
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:39,204
SARAH, WELCOME TO THE ANGLE.

18
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:41,206
FIRST OF ALL, I HAD A CHANCE TO

19
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:43,409
TALK TO YOU ON THE RADIO, YOU

20
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:45,711
ARE SO INSPIRING.

21
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:46,879
YOUR HUSBAND HAS SUFFERED

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,946
GREATLY.

23
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:50,783
HE HAS BEEN THROUGH MORE

24
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:52,384
SURGERIES THAN ANYONE CAN BEAR

25
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:53,385
AND REMEMBER.

26
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:54,586
BUT YOU HAVE TURNED YOUR FOCUS

27
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:56,789
NOT JUST TO TAKE CARE OF HIM BUT

28
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,391
ALSO TO HELP RAISE MONEY FOR

29
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:01,260
THESE TRACK CHAIRS AND OTHER

30
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,495
ITEMS AND DEVICES THAT OUR

31
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:06,598
VETERANS NEED THAT THE VA

32
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:07,566
BENEFITS DON'T NECESSARILY

33
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:07,866
COVER.

34
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:12,004
>> I REALIZE THAT WHEN MICHAEL

35
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:12,571
MINE BEGAN.

36
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:13,939
MINE WAS FOUGHT ON THE HOMEFRONT

37
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,007
OF THE VERY INSTITUTION THAT I

38
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:16,875
THOUGHT WOULD TAKE CARE OF HIM,

39
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:17,409
THE VA.

40
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,278
IT'S A VERY BUREAUCRATIC AND

41
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:20,946
LONG PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT I

42
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:22,247
LOVE ABOUT THIS.

43
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:23,782
IF WE SEE AN UNMET NEED A

45
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:28,387
WHEELCHAIRS OR ANYTHING ELSE

46
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:29,955
THESE HEROES NEED TO.

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

53
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:43,635
YOUR HUSBAND LOST HIS LEG AND

54
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:45,771
MOST OF ONE ARM, CORRECT?

55
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,773
YOU HAVE THREE YOUNG DAUGHTERS.

56
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,942
HOW IS LIFE TODAY?

57
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,977

00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:55,214
AS WE GO INTO MEMORIAL WE

59
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:56,582
WEEKEND, MANY OF MY DEAREST

60
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:58,584
FRIENDS ARE WIDOWS AND THEY HAVE

61
00:01:58,584 --> 00:01:59,785
AMERICAN FLAGS AND PLACE OF

62
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:00,586
THEIR HUSBANDS.

63
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:01,386
OUR LIFE IS MUCH MORE

64
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:02,488
CHALLENGING THAN I HAD EVER

65
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:04,189
PREDICTED AS I STARTED THIS

66
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:06,258
JOURNEY WITH MICHAEL BUT OUR

67
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:08,092
BLESSINGS HAVE OUTWEIGHED THAT.

68
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:09,026
WE ARE VERY LUCKY.

69
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:10,229
BUT FOR THE WANTED TO COME UP

70
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,630
THE FIGHT NEVER ENDS AND WE ARE

71
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,232
WITH THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES

72
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:16,101
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

73
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:17,803
>> Laura: THE VA EMISSION ACT,

74
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:18,504
I BET YOU WILL BE ON BOARD AND

75
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:19,371
THE PRESIDENT SIGNS THAT IN

76
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:19,972
EARLY JUNE.

77
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:22,174
THAT WILL DO A LOT TO HELP OUR

78
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:22,574
VETERANS.

79
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:23,876
THIS PRESIDENT GETS VERY LITTLE

80
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:27,579
CREDIT FROM THE MEDIA, BUT THIS

81
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,181
IS A BIPARTISAN EFFORT.

82
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:31,183
A LOT MORE MONEY WILL GO TOWARD

83
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:32,584
REHABILITATION AND HELPING THOSE

84
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:34,019
IN NEED.

85
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,021
>> MY HUSBAND, WE HAVE HAD A LOT

86
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:37,189
OF TIME TO SPEND THE

87
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:38,423
PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY AND HE

88
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:40,225
HAS AN UNMATCHED HEART FOR

89
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:40,592
VETERANS.

90
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:41,493
HE CAMPAIGNED UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT

91
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,228
VETERANS BE ABLE TO CHOOSE HIS

92
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:45,130
OR HER OWN HEALTH CARE PROVIDER

93
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,999
AND ITS PROMISE MADE TO COME UP

94
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,568
FROM HIS ACADEMIC CAPS.

95
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:51,003
WE ARE THRILLED.

96
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:52,437
>> Laura: THE NEWS WHEN YOU

97
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:55,641
GOT IT, APRIL 24, 2010.

98
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:57,242
TAKE US BACK TO THAT DAY.

99
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:58,844
>> WE WEREN'T MARRIED AT THE

100
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:01,580
TIME SO I GOT IT FROM HIS

101
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:01,914
MOTHER.

102
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:04,683
WE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER,

103
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:05,751
DURING THE EVENTS OF

104
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:07,252
SEPTEMBER 11, DEFENDANTS FOR HIS

105
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:07,853
CALL TO ACTION.

106
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,288
SO I WAS NOT SURPRISED TO LEARN

107
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:11,089
THAT WHEN MICHAEL DOES SOMETHING

108
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:13,292
HE GOES ALL IN, ALL THE WAY.

109
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:15,027
HE WAS SO PROUD AND HE WOULD GO

110
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:17,095
BACK TOMORROW IF THEY WOULD LET

111
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:17,563
HIM.

112
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:20,132
>> Laura: 82ND AIRBORNE.

113
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:22,334
GOING BACK TO KANDAHAR, LIKE SO

114
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:24,269
MANY OF OUR BRAVEST, STEPPED ON

115
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,906
AN IED THAT WAS PLANTED.

116
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:28,540
HORRIFIC, VICIOUS THINGS.

117
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,308
I WILL SEE YOU AT WALTER REED

118
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:30,776
NEXT WEEK I HOPE AND GET A

119
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:34,413
CHANCE TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH

120
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:38,951
HIM.
