00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,560
working on things and just putting my

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,270
energy directing it focusing it on

5
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,130
things because that is something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,960
enjoy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current project that I'm</font>

email from my university destinations of

<font color="#CCCCCC">better use of my skills initiative and</font>

13
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,460
creativity anyway so this email was

14
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,410
essentially a seven-page survey in which

15
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,359
they interviewed you about what you felt

16
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,279
like your experience at university did

17
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,320
to prepare you for your current stage in

18
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,940
life which company you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

19
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,410
now if you are employed or whether

20
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,570
you're unemployed what your plans are

21
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,280
for the next few months for the plans

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,190
get travelling etc etc etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even</font>

23
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,600
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know lots of people especially</font>

24
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,430

25
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,440
struggling to find work I also know a

26
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,700
lot of people who are in very

27
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,500
comfortable jobs right now or doing

28
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,059
exactly what they've always wanted to do

29
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,800
and I look at them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the green wants comes</font>

32
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,270
there I worked hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah and I know it's</font>

33
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,710
not because I'm not ambitious or because

34
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,059
I didn't work hard enough all those

35
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that just happens the job market</font>

36
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,930

37
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">to accept that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a valid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> response and</font>

38
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,610
also I<font color="#E5E5E5"> refuse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to allow surveys to go to</font>

39
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,100
me so anyway from<font color="#CCCCCC"> now until the faster</font>

41
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,840
and not any old jobs jobs in the areas

42
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,159
in which I'm interested in digital

43
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,619
publishing media all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff that</font>

44
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,750
I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really love and good quality</font>

45
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,280
jobs for which I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I am</font>

46
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,380
qualified and can learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also</font>

really really use my<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills why the</font>

48
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,579
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> februari because by that point we</font>

49
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,700
will be well and truly into 2013 and I

50
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,350
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> refuse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to settle for anything</font>

51
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever do not like settling settling bad</font>

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,329
sessle only for the best if you're in

53
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,040
the same position as I know a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

54
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,509
are because you've commented on past

55
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,759
videos saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pay me for the work I do</font>

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,220
for your internship<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah feel free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to join</font>

57
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,259
me over here are the rules of the 100

58
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,119
jobs challenge before starting you

59
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,530
should write a list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your dream</font>

60
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,630
job would be or variety of dream jobs

61
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,159
you don't necessarily have to name a

62
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,899
company but you can name those companies

63
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,340
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say things like what kind of</font>

64
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,170
skills you want to use of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

65
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,820
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn but then also what</font>

66
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,590
fields you want to go into and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

67
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to go in an entry level or a</font>

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,679
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> level or director level or</font>

69
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,300
executive level or you just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

70
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,890
right in

71
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,530
CEO whatever your dream job outline is

72
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,240
and then the jobs you apply to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> must</font>

73
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,920
fit at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least one of any of the criteria</font>

74
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,260
on that piece of paper also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

75
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,390
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> your existing job applications count</font>

76
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,370
I've applied to loads of jobs at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

77
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,230
point but I have to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> again from now</font>

78
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,420
until if every 1st the count restarts

79
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,950
the last thing is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm doing</font>

80
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,990
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now tell the internet about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">i've applied for considering their 79</font>

85
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,989

februari it's kind of just over an

87
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,709
application a day but do bear in mind

88
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,090
that there's Christmas and New Year's

89
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,440
and probably days when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel</font>

90
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a blind for a job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's the</font>

91
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,560
challenge even if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not taking part</font>

92
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,540
and you do have any job application tips

93
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,130
or questions or any sort of thing like

94
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,660

96
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,570
it will be great and everyone will be
