I love Indian food and I love Chipotle and I love hearing the sound of my own voice so when I heard about indie catch the new fast casual Indian restaurant that some are saying it's the Chipotle of Indian food I said wow I'm skeptical so I went there to check it out indie kitchen layout was impressive very reminiscent of Chipotle their menu was boiled down to four main dishes which is easy on my overworked brain similar to Chipotle they have the assembly line style prep table it did show how labor-intensive Indian food is to make compared to say a Chipotle burrito which beg the question if this word to become a chain could say a teenager in Arlington Heights be able to do all this work this one sure couldn't consistent quality across the entire country could potentially be a problem before we go any further let's try the food it's great it's flavorful um spicy whoa splicer than I remember it wow that's really good and I could see myself getting this please once a week as frequent as i getcha pull away for fast casual standards like what Chipotle is to Mexican food I would say indie catch is to Indian food it's not the best Indian meal you ever going to have but as far as getting something quick on a lunch break or something this is great they also have these samosas when I usually get samosas in an Indian restaurant they're big they're almost like a baseball right these guys are smaller and an order is about three this is actually really smart because they're easier to eat I have no idea what sauce this is what this looks really good it's a crisp looks really good oh yeah mmm these are really good so is indie catch the next Chipotle or next fast casual phenomenon or whatever I say no and here's why not only do we want it fast but we want to eat it fast while we drive while we walk while we work just take a look at the scientific footage of me eating outside fast food champion McDonald's is optimized for eating on the go even big burrito like Chipotle can be consumed while I play two dots on my phone can't do that with indie kitsch maybe with their doses which are kind of like tacos but they come in a big container and multiple sauces and the whole thing's just too involved perhaps fast Indian food can exist in u.s. metro areas but everywhere the specialty food association counts 40,000 Mexican restaurants in the US compared to only 5,000 Indian restaurants any restaurant chain trying to popularize Indian food in a country that's mostly unfamiliar with it as a seemingly impossible task which is unfortunate because Indian food is the bomb going on food alone Indy kids could certainly be a Chipotle contender unfortunately I feel that trying to convince America the try fast casual Indian food is an impossible task
