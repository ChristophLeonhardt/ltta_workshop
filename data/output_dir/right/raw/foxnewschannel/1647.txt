1
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:02,230
Get E *TRADE.

2
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:13,475
>> ALL OF OUR ALLIES ARE

3
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:14,809
INCREASING THE DEFENSE BUDGETS.

4
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,879
>> DO YOU GIVE ME CREDIT?

5
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,115
>> YOUR LEADERSHIP HAS HAD A

6
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:20,882
GREAT IMPACT.

7
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:27,455
>> Neil: THE NATO SECRETARY

8
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:29,591
GENERAL THANKING PRESIDENT

9
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:29,891
TRUMP.

10
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:31,059
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT GERMANY

11
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:32,961
NEEDS TO DO MORE.

12
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:34,496
ANYWAY, IN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW

13
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:37,832
SINCE MEETING THE PRESIDENT, I'M

14
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:42,637
HAPPY TO INTRODUCE SECRETARY

15
00:00:42,637 --> 00:00:45,674
GENERAL STOLTENBERG.

16
00:00:45,674 --> 00:00:47,742
THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME.

17
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:50,779
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

18
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:51,513
>> Neil: HOW DID IT GO WITH THE

19
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:51,980
PRESIDENT TODAY?

20
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,448
>> A GREAT MEETING.

21
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:58,286
THE MAIN FOCUS WAS ON DEFENSE

22
00:00:58,286 --> 00:00:59,020
SPENDING AND THE IMPORTANCE OF

23
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,556
THAT ALL OF OUR ALLIES MEET

24
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:05,060
THEIR PLEDGES OR DO WHAT THEY

25
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,061
PROMISE TO DO.

26
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:08,930
WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S

27
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,066
BEEN SOME REAL PROGRESS.

28
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:14,102
ALL OUR ALLIES HAVE STARTED TO

29
00:01:14,102 --> 00:01:16,037
INCREASE DEFENSE SPENDING AND

30
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:19,040
MORE AND MORE ALLIES MEET THE

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,143
NATO TARGET OF 2% OF GDP ON

32
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:22,477
DEFENSE.

33
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:23,778
SO WE'RE MOVING IN THAT

34
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:25,580
DIRECTION BUT STILL HAVE A LONG

35
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,548
WAY TO GO.

36
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:28,416
>> Neil: I NOTICED THAT GERMANY

37
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,185
WAS SINGLED OUT BY THE PRESIDENT

38
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:33,355
OF NOT SHARING OR DOING ITS

39
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:33,722
SHARE.

40
00:01:33,722 --> 00:01:35,957
HE DIDN'T MENTION FRANCE, BUT IT

41
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:38,560
WAS NOT -- I DON'T BELIEF THEY

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,729
WERE AT THE 2% LEVEL.

43
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:43,865
WHAT DO YOU DO IN THAT CASE?

44
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:45,634
>> WELL WHAT WE DO, WE ARE

45
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:47,902
WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR ALLIES

46
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:50,672
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IMPLEMENT

47
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:52,507
TO DO WHAT WE PROMISED.

48
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:55,577
WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT

49
00:01:55,577 --> 00:01:55,944
DIRECTION.

50
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:57,846
GERMANY HAS ALSO STARTED TO

51
00:01:57,846 --> 00:01:59,514
INCREASE DEFENSE SPENDING.

52
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:02,584
LAST YEAR THEY INCREASED DEFENSE

53
00:02:02,584 --> 00:02:05,854
BUDGETS BY AROUND 6% IN REAL

54
00:02:05,854 --> 00:02:06,688
TERMS.

55
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:09,858
AND NOT ONLY ARE MORE ALLIES

56
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:11,493
CONTRIBUTING MORE TO DEFENSE

57
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:14,763
BUDGETS, TO THE FUNDING, BUT

58
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:16,464
ALSO WITH TROOPS AND FOR

59
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:19,501
INSTANCE, NATO MISSION IN

60
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:23,638
AFGHANISTAN, OUR PRESENCE IN

61
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:25,240
IRAQ AND MORE NATO PRESENCE IN

62
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:32,914
THE EASTERN ALLIANCE.

63
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:33,682
GERMANY IS ALSO CONTRIBUTING IN

64
00:02:33,682 --> 00:02:34,516
AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ.

65
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:37,218
OUR ALLIES ARE DOING MORE BUT

66
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:39,954
EXPECT THEM TO STEP FURTHER UP.

67
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:41,823
>> Neil: GIVEN THE DEFENSE

68
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:43,325
SPENDING, EVERY COUNTRY HAS DONE

69
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:46,561
MORE THAN IT WAS DOING A YEAR OR

70
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:48,430
CERTAINLY TWO YEARS AGO, IT DOES

71
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,700
RAISE CONCERNS WHETHER NATO IS

72
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,634
PREPARING FOR SOMETHING.

73
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:55,036
IS IT?

74
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:59,507
>> WE ARE RESPONDING TO A MORE

75
00:02:59,507 --> 00:02:59,624

ENVIRONMENT.

98
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:15,490
THERE'S RUSSIAN, IRAQ AND SYRIA.

99
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,360
BOTH SPENDING AND DOING MORE IN

100
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,395
THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM.

101
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:22,163
AND I COMMEND PRESIDENT TRUMP

102
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:24,432
TODAY FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND ITS

103
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:27,502
CLEARLY HAVING AN IMPACT BECAUSE

104
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:29,838
ALL OF OURS ARE MOVING IN THE

105
00:03:29,838 --> 00:03:30,739
RIGHT DIRECTION.

106
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,707
WE DON'T WANT A NEW COLD WAR.

107
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:35,977
WE DON'T WANT A NEW ARMS RACE.

108
00:03:35,977 --> 00:03:39,881
WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE WHAT WE

109
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:43,118
CALL A DUEL TRACK APPROACH TO

110
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:43,785
RUSSIA.

111
00:03:43,785 --> 00:03:44,919
DETERRENCE HAS TO BE FIRM AND

112
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,621
STRONG AND AT THE SAME TIME,

113
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:49,090
WORK FOR A POLITICAL DIALOGUE TO

114
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,725
IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

115
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:51,226
RUSSIA.

116
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:53,027
>> Neil: IF I COULD TOUCH ON THE

117
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,796
NORTH KOREAN TALKS COMING UP

118
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:56,731
NEXT MONTH, GENERAL.

119
00:03:56,731 --> 00:03:58,700
THE PRESIDENT INTIMATED THAT

120
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,301
MAYBE A REASON FOR THE NORTH

121
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:03,438
KOREAN LEADER'S ABOUT FACE OR

122
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:05,140
TOUGHER POSTURE IS BECAUSE HE

123
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,343
MET WITH THE CHINESE LEADER AND

124
00:04:08,343 --> 00:04:11,780
IT WAS SORT OF REIGNED IN A

125
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,380
LITTLE BIT.

126
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,248
DO YOU BUY THAT?

127
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:15,750
>> MY MAIN MESSAGE TODAY IS THAT

128
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,120
ALL NATO ALLIES, NATO SUPPORTS

129
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,357
THE EFFORTS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP

130
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:26,661
TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO

131
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:30,398
THE CRISIS IN NORTH KOREA.

132
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:33,701
WE ALSO HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE

133
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,437
A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT.

134
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:36,871
HAVING SAID THAT, IT'S IMPORTANT

135
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:38,973
TO KEEP UP THE PRESSURE ON NORTH

136
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:40,408
KOREA.

137
00:04:40,408 --> 00:04:43,578
THE DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE, THE

138
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:44,913
POLITICAL PRESSURE AND THE

139
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:47,215
ECONOMIC PRESSURE.

140
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:48,483
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

141
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:51,753
THAT WE REACH A SOLUTION THAT

142
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:53,321
LEADS TO THE COMPLETE

143
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:55,423
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN

144
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,424
PENINSULA AND ALSO THE NORTH

145
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:59,627
KOREA STOP DEVELOPING NUCLEAR

146
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:00,862
WEAPONS AND STOP DEVELOPING

147
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:03,531
THEIR BALLISTIC MISSILES.

148
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:05,500
>> Neil: I GUESS THERE'S

149
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,506
DIFFERENCE DEFINITIONS OF

150
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:12,006
DENUCLEARIZATION.

151
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:13,041
IF IT LOOKS LIKE THE TWO SIDES

152
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,009
ARE FAR APART ON THAT ISSUE, THE

153
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:16,878
PRESIDENT HAS INDICATED THAT HE

154
00:05:16,878 --> 00:05:18,646
WOULD JUST WALK AWAY FROM THE

155
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:18,947
TALKS.

156
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:22,083
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF THAT, IF

157
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:22,684
HE DID?

158
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:24,419
>> I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING

159
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,955
NOW IS TO BE FOCUSED AND SUPPORT

160
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:29,557
THE EFFORTS OF FIND A NEGOTIATED

161
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:29,924
SOLUTION.

162
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:31,659
WE HOPE IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE A

163
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:34,162
SUMMIT AND HAVE A MEANINGFUL

164
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:35,463
SUMMIT WITH SOME REAL OUTCOME.

165
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:37,599
TO ACHIEVE THAT, WE NEED TO

166
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:39,334
MAINTAIN THE PRESSURE ON NORTH

167
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:39,634
KOREA.

168
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:41,903
SO THEREFORE, NATO SUPPORTS BOTH

169
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:43,805
THE INITIATIVE TO HAVE A SUMMIT,

170
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:45,139
TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH NORTH

171
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:46,741
KOREA AND AT THE SAME TIME TO

172
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:49,377
MAINTAIN THE PRESSURE ON NORTH

173
00:05:49,377 --> 00:05:49,777
KOREA.

174
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:51,145
I THINK IT WOULD BE WRONG TO

175
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:53,248
SPECULATE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE

176
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:54,682
DON'T SUCCEED.

177
00:05:54,682 --> 00:05:59,621
THE MAIN FOCUS SHOULD BE ON A

178
00:05:59,621 --> 00:06:02,423
SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT WITH REAL

179
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:04,659
PROGRESS AND REAL OUTCOME.

180
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:08,563
>> Neil: I MENTIONED THIS, THIS

181
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:10,765
WAS A 180 ON THE NORTH KOREANS,

182
00:06:10,765 --> 00:06:12,734
GOING WITH THE RELEASE OF

183
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:14,202
HOSTAGES, THE COMMITTEE TO

184
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:16,104
DECREASE NUCLEAR ACTIVITY AND

185
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:16,604
NOW THIS.

186
00:06:16,604 --> 00:06:18,840
I'M WONDERING SOMEONE WHO HAS A

187
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,012
VESTED INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME

188
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:27,315
OF THIS, DO YOU TRUST THE NORTH

189
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:27,649
KOREANS?

190
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:28,983
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE

191
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:31,286
AWARE OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

192
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:31,619
BEFORE.

193
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:32,754
THEY HAVE NOT DELIVERED WHAT

194
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:35,223
THEY PROMISED.

195
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:37,258
I'M CERTAIN THAT ANY DEAL NEEDS

196
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:39,661
TO HAVE MECHANISMS FOR

197
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:40,361
RATIFICATION AND CONTROL.

198
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:43,064
IT'S A BIT EARLY NOW TO GO INTO

199
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:46,601
THE DETAILS OF A POTENTIAL DEAL.

200
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:48,303
THE IMPORTANT THING FOR ME AND

201
00:06:48,303 --> 00:06:50,104
SECRETARY GENERAL NATO IS TO

202
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:53,441
SUPPORT EFFORTS TO HAVE A

203
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:54,876
SUMMIT, TO MAKE PROGRESS AND

204
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:57,845
THEN TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL.

205
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:00,481
A DEAL NEEDS MECHANISMS FOR

206
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:01,950
RATIFICATION FOR CONTROL.

207
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,419
TO MAKE SURE THAT NORTH KOREA IS

208
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:05,653
DELIVERING WHAT THEY PROMISE.

209
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:07,689
>> SIR, YOU'VE BEEN VERY

210
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:08,056
PATIENT.

211
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:09,324
ONE QUESTION ON VLADIMIR PUTIN

212
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:10,458
AND HOW QUIET HE'S BEEN.

213
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,026
HE HASN'T SAID OR DONE MUCH

214
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:17,732
SINCE HE WAS INAUGURATED FOR THE

215
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:18,666
FIRST TIME.

216
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,301
DOES HIS SILENCE WORRY YOU?

217
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:22,270
>> WHAT WE'VE SEEN THE LAST YEAR

218
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,273
IS A MORE ASSERTIVE RUSSIA, A

219
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:26,240
RUSSIA THAT HAS INVESTED IN NEW

220
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,410
AND MORE MODERN MILITARY

221
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,445
CAPABILITIES, WHICH HAS

222
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:32,480
INCREASED ITS MILITARY PRESENCE

223
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,950
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, SYRIA.

224
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,820
ALSO IN RUSSIA WHICH HAS BEEN

225
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,122
WILLING TO USE MILITARY FORCE

226
00:07:41,122 --> 00:07:42,690
AGAINST NEIGHBORS.

227
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,524
UKRAINE, CRIMEA.

228
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:45,860
THAT IS THE REASON WHY NATO IS

229
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,963
IMPLEMENTING THE BIGGEST

230
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:51,199
REINFORCEMENT SINCE THE COLD

231
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:51,599
WAR.

232
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,102
NATO IS INCREASING THE PRESENCE

233
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:55,603
IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO SEND A

234
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:57,305
CLEAR MESSAGE TO ANY POTENTIAL

235
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:59,674
ADVERSARY, IF ONE ALLY IS

236
00:07:59,674 --> 00:08:00,942
ATTACKED, IT WILL TRIGGER A

237
00:08:00,942 --> 00:08:02,210
RESPONSE FROM THE WHOLE

238
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:02,577
ALLIANCE.

239
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:04,078
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL DETERRENCE.

240
00:08:04,078 --> 00:00:00,000
THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT THE WAR
