1
00:00:01,632 --> 00:00:02,064
INDESPICABLE.

2
00:00:02,065 --> 00:00:04,200
WHO SENT THEM IS THE NEXT

3
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:04,567
QUESTION.

4
00:00:04,568 --> 00:00:07,236
WE HAVE TEAM FOX COVERAGE

5
00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:08,137
BEGINNING WITH CATHERINE

6
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:09,605
HERRIDGE LIVE IN WASHINGTON.

7
00:00:09,606 --> 00:00:09,972
CATHERINE?

8
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:11,908
>> IN THE LAST HOUR, LAW

9
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:14,877
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TOLD FOX

10
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:17,313
NEWS THAT THE DEVICES WERE SENT

11
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:20,049
BY A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL OR SINGLE

12
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,818
GROUP, THIS IS BASED ON

13
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:23,653
FORENSICS AS WELL AS THE FACT

14
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:25,054
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

15
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:26,923
MULTIPLE DEVICES OVER 72 HOURS.

16
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:29,225
WHAT IS KEY, THERE'S A NUMBER OF

17
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:30,693
VERY STRIKING SIMILARITIES WITH

18
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:32,862
THE PACKAGING OF THE DEVICES.

19
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:35,731
SO THAT SAME SORT OF EXCESSIVE

20
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:40,236
POSTAGE, THAT SORT OF EXCESSIVE

21
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:41,971
YELLOW PACKAGING, THE CRUDE

22
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:45,007
ADDRESS ON THE PACKAGE SENT TO

23
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:46,142
CNN THERE.

24
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:49,312
ALSO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE

25
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:53,616
ADDRESS IS SOMEWHAT SHIFTED TO

26
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:54,183
ONE SIDE.

27
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:57,153
THEY'RE ALL TELLTALE SIGNS OF A

28
00:00:57,154 --> 00:00:59,355
SUSPICIOUS DEVICE AND SHOULDN'T

29
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:00,523
BE OPENED.

30
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:04,260
I'M ALSO TOLD THAT THE GEORGE

31
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,294
SOROS PACKAGE IS SIMILAR IN

32
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:07,763
PACKAGING AND DESCRIPTIONS.

33
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:10,500
SO IT'S BEING CONSIDERED IN THIS

34
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,635
SAME GROUP AS BY THE WORKING

35
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:13,736
THEORY, AN INDIVIDUAL OR A

36
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:15,171
SINGLE GROUP, SHEP.

37
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:16,305
>> Shepard: WHAT HAVE

38
00:01:16,306 --> 00:01:17,473
AUTHORITIES SAID STANDS OUT

39
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:19,542
ABOUT THESE, IF ANYTHING?

40
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:21,511
>> WELL, I SPOKE WITH THE SOURCE

41
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:23,412
THAT DEALS DIRECTLY WITH THE

42
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:25,281
EXPLOSIVE PART OF THIS

43
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:25,715
INVESTIGATION.

44
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:27,517
THEY SAID TO ME THAT IT'S REALLY

45
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:30,553
PRETTY UNUSUAL TO SEE PIPE BOMBS

46
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:31,821
SENT IN ENVELOPES.

47
00:01:31,822 --> 00:01:34,423
THAT'S NOT STANDARD.

48
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:36,692
THERE'S NO OBVIOUS WAY TO HAVE

49
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:39,729
THE INITIATION FORWARD THE

50
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,062
DEVICE.

51
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:41,330
THEY THOUGHT THIS WAS DESIGNED

52
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:43,366
TO SEND A MESSAGE AND TERRORIZE

53
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:44,467
PEOPLE.

54
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:45,735
TYPICALLY THEY SAID THEY SEE

55
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:49,071
THESE INITIATIONS WITH THESE

56
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:50,907
MUSICAL BREATHING CARDS.

57
00:01:50,908 --> 00:01:52,375
THEY COME THROUGH THE MAIL, YOU

58
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:53,776
OPEN IT UP AND THAT'S THE

59
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:57,413
TRIGGER FOR THE DETONATOR.

60
00:01:57,414 --> 00:01:59,982
THEY DREW MY ATTENTION FOR THE

61
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:00,316
POSTAGE.

62
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:02,752
THEY SAID ALL OF THE PACKAGES

63
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:03,953
USED THE MULTIPLE AMERICAN FLAGS

64
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:05,121
TO DO THE POSTAGE.

65
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:07,456
THEY DID NOT USE ANY OF THOSE

66
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:09,625
OTHER FOREVER STAMPS THAT MANY

67
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:12,461
OF US USE WHEN WE SEND THINGS BY

68
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:13,429
SNAIL MAIL.

69
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,667
THAT'S WHAT STOOD OUT TO THEM

70
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:18,134
FROM AN INVESTIGATE

71
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:20,303
FROM AN INVESTIGATIVE POINT OF

72
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:20,603
VIEW.

73
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:21,871
>> Shepard: AND YOU LEARNED MORE

74
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:24,373
ABOUT THIS PACKAGE THAT WENT TO

75
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:24,707
FLORIDA.

76
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:25,374
>> YES.

77
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,809
ONE SUSPECT PACKAGE WENT TO

78
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,945
FLORIDA, NOT TWO.

79
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:30,813
I WAS TOLD BY A FEDERAL LAW

80
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:32,081
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL THAT THE

81
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:34,216
PACKAGE WAS SENT TO ERIC HOLDER

82
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:37,853
AND IT WAS NOT DELIVERED TO THE

83
00:02:37,854 --> 00:02:38,220
ADDRESS.

84
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:40,423
IT WAS THEN SENT TO THE RETURNED

85
00:02:40,424 --> 00:00:00,000
A DRESS, WHICH WAS DEBBIE
