two individuals in London were the victims of a brutal acid attack the individuals were of Muslim descent and they were apparently celebrating one of their birthdays when this attack took place rashaam Khan and Jamil Mukhtar suffered serious burns after they were both doused in sulfuric acid as they waited in traffic in East London on June 21st the attack of course is unfortunate but to make it even more unfortunate is the fact that the perpetrator is at large officials have not caught him yet he's a 24 year old by the name of John Tomlin and he has very unique tattoos so hopefully he does get caught at some point okay so that's who they believe did it alleged perpetrator right and and secondly do not approach him because he might have acid on him so the cops are saying if you see him make sure you call it in don't try to get them yourself or go anywhere near them so I'm about to show you guys photos of the victims that are graphic and difficult to view so for those of you who are uncomfortable looking look away as we cut to these graphics but I want to show you the damage that was done to these victims there's 21 year old rashaam Khan who was an aspiring model it was her birthday that they were celebrating when they got attacked and then here is Jamil Mukhtar okay so let's give the rest of the quotes here I'll read your mail Mukhtar quotes and then and then I want to talk to you about what I thought this story was about and what it turned out to be about he said he just squirted this clear liquid all over us which I thought was water until my cousin started to scream I was watching her burning next thing you know I'm burning when I went to the hospital they had to jet wash me to get the acid off it was excruciating pain and I was screaming like a baby so he got hit in the legs and body and face she got hit square in the face with acid and so first-degree burns and they had to put her in a coma and and then you know do the operations and try to help her and then revive her so when I first saw the story of a rashaam khan and another Muslim getting at I thought intervening was to Muslim women but it turns out it's one woman one man had acid thrown in their face I thought the story was out of Afghanistan because that happens from time to time they say oh you're going you're a woman going to school your girls going to school and they'll do an acid attack or you're not wearing your headscarf writer etc they'll do an acid attack great now our fundamentalists have merged tactics completely so now whoever this fundamentalist clown is who hates Muslims and we don't yeah I know you have to do the standard caveat you don't know it could have been totally random he's walking around with a vat of acid doesn't care and just happen to throw it at Muslims face I could have been anyone he could have been targeting Norwegians right initially the police did not treat this as a hate crime because of what you just said you don't know we don't know the details about this guy we don't know what his intentions were but apparently due to new evidence in this case they are treating it as I had as a hate crime The Guardian reports new evidence had come to light prompting them to investigate the assault as a hate crime so I don't know what that evidence is they haven't disclosed what that evidence is and you know regardless of what the intentions were this was such a hideous attack on completely innocent people and I can't read this story or even report it without getting I'm sorry I know I'm not supposed to get emotional but getting emotional because we have we're now in this insanely toxic environment people are afraid for their safety we're insanely divided the rhetoric people use is damaging and dangerous and and then you read from rochonc on the twenty one-year-old and I just I want to read you her quote because I think it's incredibly powerful she says at a time when all I am being sent is positivity and love please don't let this man anger you or categorize others regardless of whatever was going on in his head during his cruel and vicious attack I really don't want this to help fuel a division among people from a large majority there will always be a sick and twisted minority stop tearing each other down stop arguing religion and politics make peace with each other and the letting this man or the events of the past fill you up with hate will only darken the soul so but I think that a great majority people on our side left progressive would never make the insane assumption that this is all white people that's that's so crazy who could possibly believe that right or all right wingers every right winger in-law all young white men yeah right yeah with Crewcuts but the other side will not grant that they will not grant it and so how clear is it that our enemy is is not a particularly sore religion it is fundamentalists fundamentalists of all stripes who believe that the answer is violence and who like to categorize other people without knowing the content of their character at all based on how they look that is so obvious whether it's a Muslim fundamentalist who says you're not wearing your headscarf right and your to secular your to Western and I'm gonna attack you or it's a fundamentalist in the West who says you don't look right because you are wearing a head scribe scarf or you're just brown or I think you're Muslim and half the time they're wrong and they'll accidentally attack someone who seek and murder them so the obvious answer is let's be smart and try to figure out who the fundamentalists are that might do violent action to protect our citizens instead of wasting time categorizing billions of people at a time you don't like ads I hear your brother you know how you can avoid as for the Young Turks we can wait on tourists member and get all the content add free tea white tea network.com slash join
