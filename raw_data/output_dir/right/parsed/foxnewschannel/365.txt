>> Shepard: AND THERE’S BREAKING
NEWS ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL.
JOE MANCHIN IS A YES ON BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
THE SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA
JUST IN THE LAST FEW SECONDS
MADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT.
THE DEMOCRATS FROM WEST VIRGINIA
IS THE FIRST AND SO FAR ONLY
DEMOCRAT TO SAY THAT HE WILL
VOTE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
NOT A SURPRISE IN ANY WAY THAT
IT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER,
JUST ABOUT TO BE EXPECTED.
WEST VIRGINIA IS RUBY RED AND
NOW THINGS ARE AS WE EXPECTED
MIGHT BE, CHRIS.
>> YEAH, I HAVE TO SAY, I DON’T
KNOW THAT JOE MANCHIN HAS BEEN A
>> YEAH, I HAVE TO SAY, I DON’T
KNOW THAT JOE MANCHIN HAS BEEN A
PROFILE IN COURAGE ON THIS.
HE DIDN’T VOTE TO END THE
DEBATE, TO INVOKE CLOTURE IN HE
WAS SURE THAT HE WAS 50 VOTES.
HE DIDN’T ANNOUNCE HOW HE WAS
GOING TO VOTE ON KAVANAUGH UNTIL
HE SAW THAT IT WAS ALREADY
DECIDED BY SUSAN COLLINS.
SO HE’S ON THE "RIGHT SIDE OF
THE ISSUE" POLITICALLY FOR MOST
VOTERS IN WEST VIRGINIA BUT HE
WAITED UNTIL HE WAS NOT THE
SWING VOTE.
>> Shepard: THE NEXT STEP IS A
VOTE IN CONGRESS, A FULL VOTE IN
THE SENATE AND IT’S OUR
UNDERSTANDING THAT COMES
TOMORROW.
IS THAT RIGHT?
A LOT OF DEBATE FIRST.
>> A LOT OF DEBATE.
30 HOURS.
ONLY IN THE SENATE WOULD YOU CUT
OFF DEBATE BY INVOKING CLOTURE
THAT STARTS THE CLOCK FOR MORE
30 HOURS OF DEBATE.
IT ENDED BY 11:00.
THE DEMOCRATS MAY NOT TAKE THE
ENTIRE 30 HOURS.
SOMETIMES IN MID TO LATE
AFTERNOON, SOMETIME BETWEEN 3:30
AND 5:00 TOMORROW AFTERNOON, THE
AFTERNOON, SOMETIME BETWEEN 3:30
AND 5:00 TOMORROW AFTERNOON, THE
SENATE WILL VOTE AND UNLESS
THERE IS SOME UNFORESEEN CHANGE
OF MIND BY SOMEBODY HERE, LOOKS
THERE IS SOME UNFORESEEN CHANGE
OF MIND BY SOMEBODY HERE, LOOKS
LIKE IT WILL GO 50-48.
WITH ONE VOTE MISSING.
THAT WOULD BE STEVE DANES UNLESS
HE WANTS TO FLY BACK AND MAKE IT
THAT WOULD BE STEVE DANES UNLESS
HE WANTS TO FLY BACK AND MAKE IT
51-48.
>> Shepard: IT’S OUR
UNDERSTANDING HE DOES NOT.
IT’S HIS DAUGHTER’S WEDDING DAY.
IF HE DOESN’T HAVE TO FLY BACK,
IT’S HIS DAUGHTER’S WEDDING DAY.
IF HE DOESN’T HAVE TO FLY BACK,
HE WILL NOT.
THIS IS DECIDED FOR ALL UP TENTS
AND PURPOSES.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ONE SIDE
AND THE OTHER?
>> I ALWAYS THOUGHT FOR THE
DEMOCRATS, AS TOUGH AS IT IS TO
BE TO LOSE IN THE SENATE IN
TERMS OF THE CONFIRMATION OF
BRETT KAVANAUGH, THAT IT WOULD
HELP THEM IN THE MID-TERMS.
YOU’VE SEEN ALL OF THESE PEOPLE
ON CAPITOL HILL, HUNDREDS OF
THEM, 300 ARRESTED YESTERDAY.
I THINK THIS WILL ONLY IGNITE
THE FEELING AMONG A LOT OF
DEMOCRATS, PARTICULARLY WOMEN,
THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NOT
SYMPATHETIC TO THEIR INTERESTS.
SUBURBAN WOMEN ESPECIALLY.
THAT WILL EMPOWER THEM TO GO OUT
IN THE POLLS.
THE QUESTION WHICH WOULD BE MORE
HELPFUL TO REPUBLICANS, TO WIN
OR LOSE IN THE SENATE?
I BEGIN TO THINK WINNING IS THE
BEST THING.
HAD THEY LOST THAT MIGHT HAVE
DISSPIRITED THE BASE.
YOU SEE IN THE FIGHT OVER
KAVANAUGH ACCORDING TO THE
POLLS, A REAL RISE IN
ENTHUSIASM.
A BIG GAP IN INTENSITY BETWEEN
DEMOCRATS WHO SEEM VERY
INTERESTED IN THE MID-TERMS AND
REPUBLICANS THAT DID NOT SEEM SO
INTERESTED IN THE MID-TERMS AND
REPUBLICANS THAT DID NOT SEEM SO
ENERGIZED.
A LOT OF FEELING AMONG THE
REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE BASE
THAT KAVANAUGH HAS NOT BEEN
DEALT WITH FAIRLY.
IN A LOT OF POLLS WHEN YOU USED
TO SEE A GAP OF 10 OR 12 POINTS
IN A LOT OF POLLS WHEN YOU USED
TO SEE A GAP OF 10 OR 12 POINTS IS NOW PLUS 2 FOR THE DEMOCRATS.
IS NOW PLUS 2 FOR THE DEMOCRATS.>> Shepard: WE HAVE A POLITICAL
>> Shepard: WE HAVE A POLITICAL
GENERATION BETWEEN NOW AND THE
ELECTION.
THAT IS OBVIOUS.
WITH THAT SAID, THE ANALYSTS
HAVE SAID THIS VOTE, BECAUSE OF
SUBURBAN EDUCATED WHITE WOMEN
AND THE ENERGIZING OF THEM, THAT
THE HOUSE IS MORE SOLID FOR
DEMOCRATS NOW AND THE SENATE
COULD POSSIBLY BE MORE SOLID FOR
REPUBLICANS.
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT PART OF
IT?
>> YEAH, I THINK THAT MIGHT WELL
BE TRUE.
BECAUSE HOUSE DISTRICTS ARE SO
CONFINED AND OFTENTIMES
GERRYMANDERED SO THE CROSS
SECTION, THE CUT OF THE PIE, IN
EACH INDIVIDUAL DISTRICT CAN BE
SECTION, THE CUT OF THE PIE, IN
EACH INDIVIDUAL DISTRICT CAN BE
MORE LOCALIZED.YOU MIGHT SEE
SUBURBAN WOMEN IN A SUBURBAN
DISTRICT OR COLLEGE EDUCATED
PEOPLE THAT THEY’LL TURN OUT
MORE THAT WILL HAVE MORE OF AN
IMPACT IN THE HOUSE.
IN A SENATE RACE, THE ENTIRE
STATE, IT’S MORE INTENSITY.
MID-TERM ELECTIONS, PEOPLE DON’T
TEND TO TURN OUT AS MUCH UNLESS
MID-TERM ELECTIONS, PEOPLE DON’T
TEND TO TURN OUT AS MUCH UNLESS
THEY’RE ENERGIZED.
THE AFTERMATH OF OBAMA CARE, YOU
SAW REPUBLICANS TURN OUT.
THIS YEAR IN THE OPPOSITION TO
TRUMP, IT LOOKED LIKE DEMOCRATS
WOULD TURN OUT.
NOW THERE’S A BACKLASH BY
REPUBLICANS, PARTICULARLY IN
SENATE RACES, YOU’RE BEGINNING
TO MOVE
TO SEE A LOT OF THE RACES BEGIN
EITHER TOWARDS OR IN
FAVOR OF THE REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATES.
