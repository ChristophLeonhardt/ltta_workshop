00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,271

00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:04,338
I'M ROBERT GRAY AND NOW BACK TO

00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:16,517
THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW.

5
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:17,318
GREG: FINALLY, A DEMOCRAT ADMITS

6
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:18,085
THAT TRUMP'S DIPLOMACY MIGHT BE

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:18,486
WORKING.

8
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:19,320
>> THE SUMMIT WAS MUCH MORE SHOW

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,154
THAN SUBSTANCE BUT THE TEXANS

10
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:23,824
CALL ALL CATTLE, NO HAT.

11
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:24,725
[LAUGHTER]

12
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:28,396
ALL CATTLE AND NO HAT.

13
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:35,836
TRUMP IS ALL SUBSTANCE -- HOW

14
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:36,404
NICE OF MR. SCHUMER.

15
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:37,038
[APPLAUSE]

16
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,573
OF COURSE, CHUCK GOT IT WRONG

17
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:43,177
AND HE MADE THE OPPOSITE BUT I

18
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,278
CAN'T BLAME HIM BECAUSE HE'S ALL

19
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:51,619
HERE PLUG AND NO CATTLE.

20
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:51,986
[LAUGHTER]

21
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:52,720
TRUMPS CRITICS ALWAYS PHONE TO

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,521
GIBBERISH IN THEIR NEW SMEAR NOW

23
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,155
IS IT'S A CULT.

24
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:57,358
>> IT HAS DEVOLVED INTO A CULT.

25
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:58,125
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS

26
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:04,331
DEVOLVED INTO A TRUMP CULT.

27
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,533
>> THESE GUYS ARE IN A CULT AND

28
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:09,503
DRINK THE COOL EYED, I DON'T

29
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,472
KNOW.

30
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:12,173
>> IT'S BECOMING A CULT.

31
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:13,140
>> THAT IS HARD NEWS FOR THE

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,275
REPUBLICANS THAT YOU ARE IN A

33
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:14,575
CULT.

34
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,710
GREG: THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME AS

35
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,646
IF THEY ARE IN A CULT.

36
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:19,013
[LAUGHTER]

37
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:19,547
A PROFITABLE ONE.

38
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:27,588
THE MORE THEY BACK TRUMP THE

39
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:28,189
HIGHER IN THE RATINGS.

40
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,256
THE TRUMP BUMP IS PAIN FOR THEIR

41
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:29,557
BOTOX.

42
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:30,524
IT EXPOSES THE LIES THAT THERE

43
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,794
IS A PRESS CRACKDOWN UNDER TRUMP

44
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:34,762
INDUSTRY HAS NEVER BEEN MORE

45
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:35,730
VOCAL IN OPPOSITION IN THE

46
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,530
PREVIOUS EIGHT YEARS WITH THE

47
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:43,170
MEDIA UNDER OBAMA -- TALK ABOUT

48
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:43,504
A CULT.

49
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,105
THEY WERE OBAMA TOAST.

50
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,172
YOU CAN HATE TRUMP, LOVE TRUMP

51
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:47,642
AND I DON'T REALLY EVEN CARE BUT

52
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:49,243
TARGETING PEOPLE -- THEIR ALL

53
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,177
HAT AND NO CATTLE BUT THEY'RE

54
00:01:50,177 --> 00:02:01,689
ALL HAT AND NO JACKASS.

55
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:02,456
TO BE FAIR, TYRUS, EVERYBODY

56
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,557
THANKS SOMEONE ELSE IS IN A

57
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:04,725
CULPRIT IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM

58
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,926
OR LIKE THEIR BELIEFS YOU SAY

59
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,962
THEY ARE IN A CULT.

60
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:08,863
TYRUS: CULT IS THE NEW CODE WORD

61
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:09,295
FOR JACKASS.

62
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,031
OR I DON'T LIKE YOU.

63
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:14,168
IT'S THE NEW THING.

64
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,736
SAYING BUT DID TRY TO FIX IT AND

65
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:20,708
THAT IS -- HE DID NOT KNOW BUT

66
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,542
HIS ASSISTANT NEW AND HIS

67
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,412
ASSISTANT LET IT GO BUT YOU

68
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:25,713
MIGHT WANT TO HOLLER AT THE GUY

69
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,615
BECAUSE GET A GOOD LOOK -- YOU

70
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:35,423
COULD STICK YOUR HEAD UP A COWS

71
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:36,357
ASS -- WHERE IS THE GUY THAT

72
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:36,757
WROTE THIS?

73
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:37,525
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN

74
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:38,392
THEIR RUNNING OUT OF STUFF.

75
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,760
NOW THEY ARE POSSESSED OF THE

76
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,061
DEVIL.

77
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:45,833
AND YOU CAN'T ARGUE THAT.

78
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,935
GREG: IS A CALL THAT BAD, CAT

79
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:48,302
QUESTION.

80
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:54,709
KAT: NOT TO THE PEOPLE IN IT.

81
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,644
I DO SEEM LIKE I WOULD BE THE

82
00:02:56,644 --> 00:03:03,684
TYPE BUT -- I HAVE MANAGED TO

83
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,552
STEER CLEAR OF -- IT WOULD NOT

84
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,853
FEEL GOOD TO BELONG, YOU KNOW,

85
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,889
BUT I HAVE NOT GONE THAT FAR

86
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:09,156
YET.

87
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,091
IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE SOMEONE

88
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,192
TRY TO INSULT SOMEONE AND THEY

89
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:11,625
DO IT WRONG.

90
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:22,403
GREG: IT'S FANTASTIC.

91
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,404
KAT: IT'S LIKE IF YOU TRY TO

92
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:24,538
PUNCH SOMEONE IN THE FACE ANY

93
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,040
MISS AND YOU HIT THE WALL AND

94
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,174
YOU BREAK YOUR HAND THAT IS

95
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:27,875
EXACTLY WHAT HE DID THERE.

96
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,076
I DON'T UNDERSTAND -- I GET HE

97
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,111
WAS TRYING TO BE RELATABLE BUT

98
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:31,278
THE INTERNET MAKES IT SUPER EASY

99
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:31,812
TO BE RELATABLE.

100
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,749
IF YOU ARE NOT SURE YOU GOOGLE

101
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:35,015
IT.

102
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,183
THERE IS NO WAY IT'S NOT LIKE WE

103
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:39,954
RELY ON ORAL HISTORIES TO KNOW

104
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,522
WHAT PEOPLE IN THE OTHER PARTS

105
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:42,423
OF THE COUNTRY ARE DOING.

106
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:42,990
YOU CAN GOOGLE IT.

107
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,995
IT'S SO EASY.

108
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:48,763
GREG: HE PROBABLY CALLS IT THE

109
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:49,096
GOOGLE.

110
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:49,463
[LAUGHTER]

111
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,030
WHERE IS THE GOOGLE?

112
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:57,238
I LEFT IT SOMEWHERE ON MY PHONE.

113
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:57,838
WALTER, THE GOOGLE.

114
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:58,672
>> THEY DON'T HIRE WRITERS AND

115
00:03:58,672 --> 00:03:59,540
THAT'S THE BIG PROBLEM WITH

116
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,141
HOLLYWOOD POLITICS AND

117
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:11,585
EVERYTHING ELSE.

118
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,319
>> I THINK ANY POLITICIAN THAT

119
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,220
HAS A POPULIST FIELD WHETHER

120
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,622
TRUMP OR OBAMA OR WHOEVER IT IS

121
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:15,556
SARAH PALIN, FOR EXAMPLE, ALL

122
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:16,690
THESE PEOPLE HAVE THAT POPULIST

123
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,394
FEEL AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS YOU

124
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,327
DO HAVE A SEGMENT OF THE

125
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,329
POPULATION THAT CAN FEEL A

126
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:22,797
LITTLE CULTISH.

127
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:23,731
THEY FOLLOW YOU NO MATTER WHAT

128
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,099
AND LOOK UP TO YOU AND BECOME A

129
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:25,933
PERSONALITY RATHER THAN A

130
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:26,600
POLITICIAN OR SOME, NATION.

131
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,671
ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ALSO TAKE A

132
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,105
TON OF HEAT.

133
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,039
TRUMP TAKES HEAT FROM THE MEDIA

134
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:32,439
EVERY DAY.

135
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:40,681
SARAH PALIN, SAME THING.

136
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:41,549
YEAH, THERE IS A CULTISH SEGMENT

137
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:42,616
OF THE POPULATION BUT SO WHAT?

138
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,751
TO SAY THAT TRUMP HAS CULTISH

139
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:44,652
FOLLOWERS AND OBAMA DID NOT,

140
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:57,231
EVERY PERSON ON THAT PANEL WAS

141
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:57,765
CULTISH FOR OBAMA.

142
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:58,332
COME ON QUESTION IS.

143
00:04:58,332 --> 00:04:59,099
TYRUS: WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE DOING

144
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,134
THAT -- WAS THERE A BUNCH OF

145
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,235
TRUMP GUYS WITH RED TIES RUNNING

146
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,169
AROUND THE NORTH KOREAN SUMMIT?

147
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,237
WHAT IS THE CULT DOING OTHER

148
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:04,305
THAN THE PRESIDENT IS DOING HIS

149
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,139
JOB BUT I DON'T SEE --

150
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,807
[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS]

151
00:05:06,807 --> 00:00:00,000
GREG: ARE YOU SAYING -- IF I
