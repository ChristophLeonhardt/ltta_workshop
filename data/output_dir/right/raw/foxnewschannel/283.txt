1
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:00,605
WHY?

2
00:00:00,606 --> 00:00:02,107
WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS?

3
00:00:02,108 --> 00:00:03,641
DANA PERINO PAYS VERY CLOSE

4
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:05,210
ATTENTION IN BETWEEN HOSTING

5
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:07,645
"THE DAILY BRIEFING" AND

6
00:00:07,646 --> 00:00:09,614
APPEARING ON "THE FIVE."

7
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:11,383
DANA, THIS COMES OUT OF NOWHERE.

8
00:00:11,384 --> 00:00:13,051
NOW EVERYBODY IS AGAINST THE

9
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:13,718
ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

10
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:13,985
WHY?

11
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:15,387
>> IT COMES IN CYCLES.

12
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:16,821
THE LAST TIME I REALLY REMEMBER

13
00:00:16,822 --> 00:00:18,890
HEARING A LOT ABOUT IT WAS AFTER

14
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:21,593
THE ELECTION OF 2000 WITH

15
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:22,961
DEMOCRATS VERY BITTER.

16
00:00:22,962 --> 00:00:25,497
LOOK, SOME WAYS UNDERSTANDABLY,

17
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:25,930
RIGHT?

18
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:26,831
>> Tucker: I AGREE.

19
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:29,000
>> IT CAME DOWN TO THE RECOUNT.

20
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,336
THE SUPREME COURT MAKES THAT

21
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:31,703
DECISION.

22
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:34,205
YOU HEAR THE DRUM BEAT, THE

23
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:35,373
DEMOCRATS SAYING THIS IS NOT

24
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:36,174
FAIR TO US.

25
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:37,876
WE WIN THE POPULAR VOTE.

26
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:40,278
THEREFORE, WE SHOULD WIN THE

27
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:40,945
PRESIDENCY.

28
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:42,047
DOESN'T THAT MAKE SENSE?

29
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:43,581
THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.

30
00:00:43,582 --> 00:00:44,582
>> Tucker: WAIT A SECOND.

31
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,919
I DIDN'T -- I'M NOT THAT HOLD.

32
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,287
I COVERED BOTTLE OF BILL

33
00:00:49,288 --> 00:00:50,722
CLINTON'S CAMPAIGNS.

34
00:00:50,723 --> 00:00:53,291
HE NEVER WON THE POPULAR VOTE.

35
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:55,260
>> YOU CAN BLAME ROSS PEROT FOR

36
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,595
THAT, IF YOU WERE --

37
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:58,830
>> Tucker: FOR SURE.

38
00:00:58,831 --> 00:00:59,564
THAT'S TRUE.

39
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:00,899
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED, OF COURSE.

40
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,134
ROSS PEROT, THIRD-PARTY

41
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:04,436
CANDIDATE.

42
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:07,672
BUT STILL YOU HAD A GUY THAT

43
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:09,074
DIDN'T WIN THE MAJORITY AND

44
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:10,575
CONSIDERED ME AS A LEGITIMATE

45
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:10,942
PRESIDENT.

46
00:01:10,943 --> 00:01:11,643
WHY DID THAT CHANGE?

47
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:13,244
>> WHAT YOU'RE SEEING, PRESIDENT

48
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:15,547
TRUMP WON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

49
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:17,248
DIDN'T WIN THE POPULAR VOTE.

50
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:18,550
HILLARY CLINTON REPEATS THAT SHE

51
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:19,651
WON THE POPULAR VOTE.

52
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:21,319
THAT'S NOT THE CONTEST.

53
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
THAT'S NOT THE GAME.

54
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:25,423
YOU HAVE TO WIN THE ELECTORAL

55
00:01:25,424 --> 00:01:25,757
COLLEGE.

56
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:28,226
PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT TO STATES

57
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:29,494
LIKE WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN,

58
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:30,829
WISCONSIN BEING THE BIGGEST.

59
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,230
HAD HILLARY CLINTON PLAYED THE

60
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:34,065
GAME A DIFFERENT WAY, IF SHE

61
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:35,967
TRIED TO WIN THE ELECTORAL

62
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:37,569
COLLEGE AND THE POPULAR VOTE --

63
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,504
THE THING IS THE FOUNDERS REALLY

64
00:01:39,505 --> 00:01:41,272
WANTED OUR COUNTRY TO BE A

65
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:43,308
FEDERALIST SYSTEM.

66
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:45,510
THEY WANTED THE STATES TO BE

67
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:45,844
DIVERSE.

68
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:47,112
THEY DID GIVE SLIGHTLY MORE

69
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:49,481
POWER TO THE SMALLER STATES, BUT

70
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:53,351
THEY GENERALLY FAVORED THE MORE

71
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:54,119
POPULAR STATES.

72
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,521
DEMOCRATS SEE GOING FORWARD,

73
00:01:56,522 --> 00:01:58,756
CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, FLORIDA,

74
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:00,291
ALL OF THESE BIG STATES MAKING

75
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:01,993
THE DECISIONS THAT THEY WANT

76
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:03,695
LIKE MEDICARE FOR ALL.

77
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:07,098
WHEN SOME STATES LIKE WYOMING,

78
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,168
NORTH DAKOTA, MONTANA, STAMP

79
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,569
THEIR FEET AND SAY NO, THE

80
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,004
DEMOCRATS THINK THAT THAT IS

81
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:13,338
UNFAIR.

82
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:14,272
SO THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE RULES

83
00:02:14,273 --> 00:02:15,707
OF THE GAME.

84
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:19,377
THE IDEA THAT IT'S RACIST IS

85
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:19,811
PREPOSTEROUS.

86
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:21,179
YOU HAVE THE GREAT POINT ABOUT

87
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,147
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

88
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:25,216
I FEEL THAT IT'S DEMOCRATS

89
00:02:25,217 --> 00:02:26,417
SQUAWKING BECAUSE THEY'RE

90
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:28,453
STRUGGLING TO FIND A MESSAGE,

91
00:02:28,454 --> 00:02:29,287
STRUGGLING TO FIND UNITY.

92
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:30,922
THEY WANT TO BLAME THE SYSTEM.

93
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,657
THEY GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF ONE

94
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:34,058
NOT UNDERSTANDING OUR HISTORY,

95
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:34,592
NUMBER 1.

96
00:02:34,593 --> 00:02:35,426
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

97
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:37,996
NUMBER 2, NOT APPRECIATING OUR

98
00:02:37,997 --> 00:02:39,597
COUNTRY AND HOW OUR FOUNDERS SET

99
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:40,298
IT UP.

100
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:42,000
>> Tucker: THAT'S RIGHT.

101
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:43,668
THEY COULD RUN OR MIDDLE CLASS

102
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:44,035
ECONOMICS.

103
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:44,602
THAT ALWAYS WORKS.

104
00:02:44,603 --> 00:02:46,271
>> THIS IS A BIG WASTE OF TIME.

105
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:48,173
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS NOT

106
00:02:48,174 --> 00:02:48,673
GOING TO CHANGE.

107
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:50,642
IN YOUR GRANDCHILDREN'S

108
00:02:50,643 --> 00:00:00,000
LIFETIME, THEY MIGHT TAKE
