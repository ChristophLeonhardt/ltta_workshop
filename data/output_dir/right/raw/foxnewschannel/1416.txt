00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:16,822
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA, HOME OF THE

3
00:00:16,822 --> 00:00:18,023
PLACE THAT THEY TRAIN SO MANY OF

4
00:00:18,023 --> 00:00:19,858
THE NEXT GENERATION OF MARINE

5
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:21,760
OFFICERS HEADED OUT TO JOIN THE

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,160
FLEET.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,562
ONE THING THAT HAS CHANGED SO

8
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:27,232
MUCH ABOUT WARFARE ESPECIALLY IF

9
00:00:27,232 --> 00:00:28,901
IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN AND SYRIA IS

10
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:30,669
THE USE OF MILITARY WORKING DOGS

11
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:32,838
LIKE MO HERE WITH HIS HANDLER,

12
00:00:32,838 --> 00:00:34,473
SERGEANT RAYMOND CLEVELAND.

13
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:35,941
AND SHALL WE SAY WE GOT A

14
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:38,810
FIRST-HAND LOOK AT EXACTLY WHAT

15
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,980
MO CAN DO ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

16
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,752
>> HE'S ACTUALLY A PATROL WITH

17
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:49,354
SUSPECT APPREHENSION AND AN

18
00:00:49,354 --> 00:00:50,022
EXPLOSIVE DETECTOR DOG.

19
00:00:50,022 --> 00:00:52,824
HE LOCATES BETWEEN 15 TO 30

20
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:54,560
DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPLOSIVES.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,294
>> REPORTER: YOU THINK OF THE

22
00:00:55,294 --> 00:00:56,428
TRAINING THAT GOES INTO A

23
00:00:56,428 --> 00:00:58,897
MARINE, HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO

24
00:00:58,897 --> 00:01:00,866
THE TRAINING THAT GOES INTO A

25
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:01,567
MARINE DOG?

26
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:02,901
>> IT'S THE SAME KIND OF

27
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:04,102
TRAINING.

28
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:06,805
WE'LL GET MARINES FROM BASIC

29
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:10,742
MILITARY POLICE SCHOOL, RECRUIT

30
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:11,276
SCHOOL, ALL THAT.

31
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:13,512
THEY GO THROUGH 120 DAYS OF

32
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:14,746
BASIC TRAINING AND WE GET THEM.

33
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:15,614
THEY'RE VERY BASIC.

34
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:17,683
ONCE WE GET THEM THEY GO THROUGH

35
00:01:17,683 --> 00:01:19,818
40 HOURS A WEEK OF TRAINING

36
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:22,821
UNTIL THEIR PROFICIENCY IS HIGH

37
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:25,791
ENOUGH TO BE AN OPERATIONAL DOG.

38
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:26,692
>> LELAND: TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH

39
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:29,895
OF A DEPLOYMENT DOGS MAKE FOR

40
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:30,829
MARINES WHEN YOU'RE OVERSEAS.

41
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:31,863
>> IT'S PHENOMENAL.

42
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:34,166
THE DOGS WITH THEIR EXPLOSIVE

43
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,068
DETECTION ASPECT SAVE LIVES,

44
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:38,370
WALK IN FRONT OF THE INFANTRY

45
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,606
MARINES IN SOME OF THE MOST

46
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:41,139
HOSTILE LOCATIONS.

47
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:43,108
THE FIGHT ISN'T JUST OVERSEAS.

48
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:45,644
THE FIGHT IS HERE, DOMESTIC

49
00:01:45,644 --> 00:01:46,511
TERRORISM, THINGS ALONG THOSE

50
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:46,878
LINES.

51
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:48,780
HAVING THE DOGS AT THE GATE, AT

52
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,983
THE INSTALLATION, HAVING THAT

53
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:53,852
ASSET READILY AVAILABLE TO THE

54
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:55,621
INSTALLATION COMMANDER IS

55
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:56,088
PHENOMENAL.

56
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:56,955
>> LELAND: WHERE DO YOU GO FROM

57
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:58,490
A DOG THAT'S OUT WITH TONS OF

58
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,725
PEOPLE, RUNNING IN A MARATHON,

59
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:01,693
AND IS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND FINE,

60
00:02:01,693 --> 00:02:03,528
TO THE DOG THAT WE'RE GOING TO

61
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:04,730
SEE RUN ME AND CHASE ME DOWN?

62
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,832
>> IT'S A LIGHT SWITCH EFFECT.

63
00:02:06,832 --> 00:02:09,800
ONCE THAT HARNESS GOES ON THAT

64
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,504
DOG, THAT DOG KNOWS IT'S TIME TO

65
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:13,038
WORK.

66
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:14,740
THE DOG WILL FLIP ON THE LIGHT

67
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,677
SWITCH AND TAKE HIM DOWN, FLIP

68
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:21,713
THE LIGHT SWITCH OFF WHEN THE

69
00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:23,582
SUSPECT IS APPREHENDED.

70
00:02:23,582 --> 00:02:25,717
>> LELAND: DO THE DOGS EVER LOSE

71
00:02:25,717 --> 00:02:26,685
THE BATTLE?

72
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:27,586
>> NEVER.

73
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:28,053
DOGS NEVER LOSE.

74
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:40,699
YOU'LL SEE.

75
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:42,734
YOU'LL SEE.

76
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:43,769
>> ELIZABETH: LELAND --

77
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:44,803
>> LELAND: I SAW AND NOW YOU SAW

78
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:46,805
FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT ANGLES

79
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:49,808
HERE A LOT OF WHAT MO CAN DO AND

80
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:50,976
OTHER MILITARY WORKING DOGS CAN

81
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:51,743
DO.

82
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:52,778
WE CAN'T SHOW YOU, WE CAN TELL

83
00:02:52,778 --> 00:02:53,979
YOU ABOUT IT, LIZ.

84
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:56,715
I KNOW YOUR DOGS ARE AS

85
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:57,683
WELL-TRAINED AS THIS.

86
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:58,950
THEY'RE SENDING THEM OUT

87
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,687
500 YARDS TO SEARCH OUT

88
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:02,054
I.E.D.s.

89
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:03,488
NOT ONLY DO THEY FIND THE

90
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:04,823
EXPLOSIVES, THEY THEN GO AND

91
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:05,857
START TRACKING THE PEOPLE WHO

92
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:07,793
PUT THE EXPLOSIVES THERE, WHICH

93
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:09,695
IS A NEW SKILL THAT THE MILITARY

94
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:10,929
IS WORKING ON TRAINING THESE

95
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:12,764
DOGS FOR, JUST IN THE PAST

96
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:13,665
COUPLE OF YEARS.

>> ELIZABETH: I DON'T WANT TO

98
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:16,068
MAKE LIGHT OF IT BECAUSE IT IS

99
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:17,469
FASCINATING WHAT THESE ANIMALS

100
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:19,504
CAN DO AND THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLE

101
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:20,706
AND THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO TRAIN

102
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:21,006
THEM.

103
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,741
IF I COULD JUST WATCH THE VIDEO

104
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:25,377
OF YOU GETTING TACKLED OVER AND

105
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:27,979
OVER AGAIN, I DON'T WANT THIS TO

106
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,414
COME OUT WRONG.

107
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:31,083

I'M NOT SURE THAT MY LAB TERRIER

113
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:40,125
MIXES FROM KILL SHELTERS CAN DO

114
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,627
THE WORK THAT THEY DO, BUT IT'S

115
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:43,228
INSPIRING NONETHELESS.

116
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:44,262
YOU DID A GREAT JOB OUT THERE.

117
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:45,697
NOT THAT I WANT TO SEE THE VIDEO

118
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:47,766
OF YOU GETTING TAKEN DOWN OVER
