1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,000
MANY ARE WONDERING HOW DONALD
TRUMP PLANS ON BALANCING THE

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,860
BUDGET WHEN HE WOULD LIKE TAX
CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,860
WELL,

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,230
UNSURPRISINGLY THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION IS EYEING THE ONE

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,220
AND ONLY DEDUCTION THE MIDDLE
CLASS GETS TO TAKE IT MANAGE OF

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,710
-- MORTGAGE DEDUCTIONS.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,710
AWESOME.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,220
NOTHING IS SET IN STONE, THIS IS

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,330
JUST SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN
PROPOSED, BUT APPARENTLY THERE

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,400
WAS A WHITE HOUSE ROUNDTABLE
WHERE THEY WERE DISCUSSING

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,049
BALANCING THE BUDGET AND TAXES,
AND UNFORTUNATELY IT SEEMS LIKE

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,450
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS
SUGGESTED WAS DOING AWAY -- NOT

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,940
NECESSARILY DOING AWAY -- BUT
CAPPING, FURTHER CAPPING, THE

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:55,570
MORTGAGE DEDUCTION MIDDLE-CLASS
INDIVIDUALS CAN TAKE A VANTAGE

15
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:04,809
OF.

16
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:05,809
SO --

17
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:07,830
LET ME BREAK A FEW THINGS DOWN
BEFORE WE CONTINUE.

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,830
IF YOU ARE A

19
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,930
SINGLE TAX FILER OR A MARRIED
TAX FILER, AND MOST CASES THE

20
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,800
CAP IS ALREADY AT $500,000.

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,490
WHEN
THEY SAY THE CAP IS AT $500,000

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,000
IT MEANS THAT IT'S THE VALUE OF
THE MORTGAGE YOU TOOK OUT, THE

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,030
VALUE OF THE LOAN, YOUR
OUTSTANDING DEBT FOR YOUR

24
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,030
MORTGAGE.

25
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,740
SO WHEN YOU PAY YOUR
MORTGAGE OBVIOUSLY YOU ALSO PAY

26
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:39,390
INTEREST ON THAT LOAN, AND THAT
INTEREST IS TAX-DEDUCTIBLE.

27
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,390
THEY

28
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,770
ESSENTIALLY WANT TO LOWER THE
CAP SO IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE

29
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,060
DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO GET MORE
MONEY IN THE FORM OF A TAX

30
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,590
REFUND WHEN YOU USE THAT
DEDUCTION ON YOUR TAXES.

31
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,490
CAN I ASK A QUESTION?

32
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,200
LET'S
SAY I HAVE MY HOUSE AND THE LOAN

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,650
IS 600,000, UNDER THIS NEW RULE
I WOULD BE ABLE TO DEDUCT IT?

34
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,080
YOU GET THE FIRST 500,000.

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,739
IN
SOME CASES IF YOU HAVE TWO

36
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:17,329
MORTGAGES THEY WILL ALLOW YOU TO
DEDUCT UP TO ONE MILLION.

37
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,329
THEY

38
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,379
WANT TO LOWER IT FOR THAT, AND
POTENTIALLY LOWER IT FOR

39
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:22,590
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE ONE
MORTGAGE AS WELL.

40
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,590
AGAIN, THIS IS

41
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,879
AN IDEA THEY HAVE MENTIONED, BUT
THE REASON I WANT TO REPORT ON

42
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,439
IT IS BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONE
AND ONLY DEDUCTION THAT THE

43
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,749
MIDDLE CLASS GETS TO TAKE IT
MANAGE OF.

44
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:34,749
THEY NEVER HAVE

45
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:37,609
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CORPORATE
TAX LOOPHOLES, WHICH IS WHERE

46
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:38,689
THE REAL PROBLEM IS.

47
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,370
WE WILL GET
TO THAT IN A SECOND.

48
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:50,299
SO TRUMP --

49
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:52,939
IT'S BECAUSE HE PROMISED HE
WOULDN'T TOUCH THIS DEDUCTION.

50
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:57,030
BY THE WAY IT ALSO IMPACTS
DEVELOPERS WHO WANT TO BUILD

51
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,950
MORE PROPERTIES, SO THESE
REALTORS ARE LIKE, JUST DON'T

52
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,629
MESS WITH THAT BECAUSE IT IS
GOING TO HURT AN ALREADY

53
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:18,739
QUESTIONABLE HOUSING MARKET.

54
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:39,069
SO --

55
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:40,870
BUT HERE IS THE THING --
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE

56
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,919
MORTGAGE DEDUCTION AND DOING
AWAY WITH THAT ONE DEDUCTION

57
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,301
THAT, AGAIN, THE MIDDLE CLASS
GETS TO TAKE IT MANAGE OF, WHY

58
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:50,819
DON'T WE FOCUS ON CORPORATE TAX
LOOPHOLES?

59
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:51,819
REPUBLICANS WILL SAY

60
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:55,209
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, OUR
CORPORATE TAXES ARE SO HIGH,

61
00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,069
IT'S LIKE 35%, IT IS CRIPPLING
BUSINESSES IN AMERICA.

62
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:01,069
FIRST OF

63
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:03,290
ALL, A LOT OF THOSE DEDUCTIONS
AND LOOPHOLES DON'T APPLY TO

64
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,579
SMALL BUSINESSES, THEY APPLY TO
MASSIVE CORPORATIONS THAT DON'T

65
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:10,760
NEED THOSE LOOPHOLES TO BEGIN
WITH, AND IF YOU THINK ANA, YOU

66
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,389
ARE JUST A LIBERAL, YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT,

67
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,209
CORPORATE TAXES ARE SUPER HIGH
-- HERE ARE COMPANIES THAT PAID

68
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:30,510
NO FEDERAL INCOME TAX FROM 2008
TO 2015.

69
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,289
PEPCO HOLDINGS, PG&E

70
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:37,960
CORPORATION, INTERNATIONAL
PAPER, FIRST ENERGY,

71
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,289
PRICELINE.COM, AMOS ENERGY,
GENERAL ELECTRIC --

72
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:44,419
THEY ARE ALL ENERGY COMPANIES,
LOOK AT THEM.

73
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:51,710
THEY PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL
INCOME TAXES FROM 2008 TO 2015

74
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,289
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
WOULD LIKE TO FURTHER CUT THEIR

75
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:56,289
TAXES.

76
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,310
GUESS WHAT, HOW ABOUT YOU
DON'T TOUCH OUR MORTGAGE

77
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,270
DEDUCTIONS AND ACTUALLY FOCUS ON
HAVING THE WEALTHIEST

78
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,090
CORPORATIONS IN THE COUNTRY PAY
THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES.

79
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,090
HOW

80
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,090
ABOUT THAT?

81
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,270
I HAVE A DIFFERENT TAKE --
THEY ARE CORRECT TO LOWER THE

82
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,650
THRESHOLD FOR THE MORTGAGE
DEDUCTION, AND HERE'S WHY --

83
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,870
MOST AMERICANS CAN'T AFFORD TO
HAVE MASSIVE HOMES THAT HAVE A

84
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,259
$500,000 OR MILLION DOLLAR
MORTGAGE.

85
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:24,770
SO IF THEY LOWER THE

86
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,479
THRESHOLD TO 500,000, I'M OKAY
WITH THAT, AND THEY WANT TO

87
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:34,189
LOWER THE STANDARD INDUCTIONS,
SO THAT HELPS THE MAJORITY OF

88
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:37,539
LOWER INCOME AMERICANS.

89
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:40,699
NOW,
WHAT I DON'T WANT THEM TO DO IS

90
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,440
TO DO THIS TO PAY FOR OTHER TAX
CUTS.

91
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,700
THAT'S RIGHT, YES.

92
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,420
THEY SHOULD DO THIS AND TAKE
AWAY THE DEDUCTIONS FOR WEALTHY

93
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,170
HOMEOWNERS, SO PEOPLE WHO ARE
BUYING MULTIMILLION DOLLAR

94
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,129
HOMES, THEY DON'T NEED THIS
DEDUCTION AND SHOULDN'T GET IT.

95
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:56,129
AGREED.

96
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:58,759
WE SHOULD ALSO LEAVE THE
OTHER TAX CUTS ALONE -- I'M

97
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,039
SORRY, DON'T DO THE OTHER TAX
CUTS.

98
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,750
SO WE WOULD HAVE A BIGGER

99
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,330
SURPLUS, AND SPEND THAT MONEY ON
OTHER THINGS THAT MATTER A LOT

100
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,330
MORE.

101
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,319
THE WAY THEY ARE DOING
AWAY WITH THIS DEDUCTION TO FUND

102
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,360
OTHER DEDUCTIONS IS WRONG,
THEY SHOULD HAVE BOTH THE

103
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,349
DUCTION GO AWAY.

104
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:20,689
LET ME JUMP IN.

105
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:23,411
I HATE
SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENTS, AND I

106
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:26,309
UNDERSTAND THAT I'M ABOUT TO
MAKE A SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT

107
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:32,610
-- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
BE PROTECTIVE OF THE TYPES OF

108
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,980
DEDUCTIONS THAT MIDDLE-CLASS
INDIVIDUALS GET TO TAKE IT

109
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
VANTAGE OF.

110
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,689
I DON'T WANT THEM TO
TOUCH IT.

111
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,150
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

112
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:45,001
VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DON'T
HAVE MORTGAGES OVER $500,000, I

113
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,050
DON'T CARE.

114
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,250
I DON'T WANT THEM TO
TOUCH THIS, MAINLY BECAUSE THIS

115
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,979
IS NOT THE ISSUE THAT IS LEADING
TO THE MASSIVE DEFICIT WE HAVE

116
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:54,979
IN THE COUNTRY.

117
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,550
THE FACT THAT
OUR CORPORATIONS, THE TOP

118
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,270
EARNING CORPORATIONS IN THE
COUNTRY, GET AWAY WITH NOT

119
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,960
PAYING ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAXES,
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

120
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
THE FACT

121
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,990
THAT WE SUBSIDIZE A LOT OF THESE
COMPANIES THAT DON'T PAY ANY

122
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,449
FEDERAL INCOME TAXES IS PART OF
THE PROBLEM.

123
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:10,699
I THINK THAT IS

124
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,879
WHERE THE FOCUS NEEDS TO BE, AS
OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE

125
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,340
WORKING HARD TRYING TO EARN
ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A HOME.

126
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,400
IT'S INDISPUTABLE THAT THE
BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THE

127
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,800
CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLE, WHERE
ALL THOSE CORPORATIONS PAY ZERO

128
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,180
TAXES.

129
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,479
I TOTALLY AGREE ON THAT.

130
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,639
AND THEN ON THE ISSUE OF THIS

131
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,010
PARTICULAR TEXT DEDUCTION, MANY
PEOPLE HAVE SAID -- AND THESE

132
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,629
ARE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT -- THEY
SAY IT'S UNFAIR BECAUSE IT

133
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,470
ALLOWS RICH PEOPLE TO BUY MORE
PROPERTY AND CONSOLIDATE MORE

134
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,650
WEALTH, BECAUSE IN AMERICA THE
FASTEST WAY OF BUILDING WEALTH

135
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,000
IS HOME OWNERSHIP.

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,930
SO IF YOU
HAVE THE ABILITY ABILIT TO TAKE

137
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,849
OUT $1 MILLION MORTGAGE, THAT
HOME THAT IS WORTH A MILLION

138
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,759
TODAY MAY NOT BE WORTH 5 MILLION
TOMORROW, BUT IF YOU ARE NOT AS

139
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,020
RICH AND TAKE OUT A SMALLER
MORTGAGE YOUR HOME MIGHT BE

140
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:16,330
WORTH 200,000 TOMORROW, SO IT'S
A BIGGER GAP OF WEALTH.

141
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,330
I'M NOT

142
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,740
OPPOSED TO IT NECESSARILY, BUT
I'M OPPOSED TO IT IF THAT'S

143
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,590
A WAY TO FUND EVEN WORSE TAX
POLICY FOR THE RICHEST

144
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,590
AMERICANS.

145
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,409
I KNOW TRUMP IS NO FAN OF JEFF
BEZOS.

146
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:30,750
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE

147
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,640
SUBSIDIZING AMAZON BY GIVING TAX
BREAKS FOR THEM TO COME IN --

148
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,650
THEY DON'T PAY SALES TAX IN A
LOT OF PLACES, RIGHT?

149
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,070
SO THEY

150
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,909
ARE SUBSIDIZING THIS COMPANY TO
COME IN AND UNDERCUT THEIR

151
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:46,580
BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES, SO WHEN
THEY LOSE A BRICK-AND-MORTAR

152
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,280
STORE THEY LOSE THAT TAX
REVENUE, AND THEY ARE

153
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,290
SUBSIDIZING ANOTHER COMPANY TO
DECIMATE THEIR TEXTBASED.

154
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,290
IF YOU

155
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,760
WANT TO CUT A LOOPHOLE, THAT'S
THE ONE I WOULD CUT.

156
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
I WOULD TRY

157
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,520
TO MAKE SURE AMAZON HAD TO PAY
ITS REAL TAXES SO IT WOULDN'T BE

158
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,040
ABLE TO UNFAIRLY COMPETE AGAINST
BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES AND

159
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,160
UNDERMINE PEOPLE'S REAL ESTATE
TAX BASE.

160
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,830
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT

161
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,890
WHERE YOU WANT TO CUT --

162
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,160
HOW ABOUT WALMART?

163
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,580
THEY ARE
THE ONES WHO STARTED THE WHOLE

164
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,530
TRICK OF GIVING EVERYONE 35
HOURS A WEEK SO THEY DON'T GET

165
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,810
BENEFITS, AND WHEN YOU APPLY FOR
A JOB AT WALMART MANY TIMES THEY

166
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,830
HAND YOU PAPERWORK SO YOU CAN
GET ON WELFARE.

167
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,020
WE ARE SUBSIDIZING THESE
COMPANIES.

168
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,860
WE ARE SUBSIDIZING WALMART AS
AN INSTITUTION, MEANWHILE THEY

169
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,770
HAVE RECORD PROFITS AND THEIR
EXECUTIVES EARNED TREMENDOUS

170
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,020
AMOUNT OF MONEY, AND THE SIX
WALMART HEIRS OWN AS MUCH AS THE

171
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,340
BOTTOM 40% OF AMERICA.

172
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,070
IT'S A
CRAZY SYSTEM.

173
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,050
AND UNFORTUNATELY WE FOCUS ON
ATTACKING THE POWERLESS, WHILE

174
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,980
THE POWERFUL LITERALLY GET AWAY
WITH, YOU KNOW -- NOT PAYING

175
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,980
THEIR FAIR SHARE.

176
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,160
I WAS GOING TO USE DIFFERENT
LANGUAGE BUT I STOPPED MYSELF.

177
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,210
THEY OWN OUR POLITICIANS.

178
00:10:04,210 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO.
