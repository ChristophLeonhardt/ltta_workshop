current coalition to legalize gay

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,790
marriage people cheered some grumbled

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,730
but it finally looks like the momentum

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was started by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Labour</font>

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,289
finally however this week the grumbles

12
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">seem to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been guessing a little</font>

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,180
louder as there seems to be a growing of

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,450
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> billion of backbenchers ahead of the</font>

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,860
later on this year sources estimated

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,050
that anywhere between 30 and 100 toy

18
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,579
ministers are going to bail on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue</font>

but assuming<font color="#E5E5E5"> that most liberal Democrat</font>

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,100
and labour ministers vote in favor of

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,079
the change to legalize gay marriage the

<font color="#CCCCCC">belling isn't going to be enough to</font>

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,280
block the change completely that said

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,140
this is a side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the Conservative Party</font>

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,090
that we haven't seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a very long time</font>

27
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,060
no one that I was expecting to see I've

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,920
never formally said this<font color="#CCCCCC"> on youtube</font>

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,170
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've never really had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to but I</font>

30
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,850
identify as being gay<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I feel</font>

31
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,220
quite strongly about this issue since

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,890
2005 the UK has allowed same-sex couples

33
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,439
to enter into civil partnerships these

34
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,500
carry the same legal weight as marriage

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,729
and it's often argued that the gay

36
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,640
community should be happy with civil

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,950
partnerships why after all<font color="#E5E5E5"> should we</font>

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,740
impose ourselves on the insane<font color="#CCCCCC"> Junt</font>

39
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,689
institution of marriage that has always

40
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,460
traditionally been between a man and a

41
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,350
woman<font color="#E5E5E5"> so why am I not happy with civil</font>

42
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,909
partnerships being the end game<font color="#CCCCCC"> of gay</font>

43
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,100
rights in this country because as long

44
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">as I can have a civil partner but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

45
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,689
husband implies that the relationships

46
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,110
that I have are equal but different to

47
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,030
the relationships that heterosexual

48
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,520
couples have the love between a man and

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,619
a man and a woman<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a woman should not</font>

50
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,049
be classified differently to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font>

51
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,659
that heterosexual couples have love is

52
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,329
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it should be legalized that way</font>

53

57
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,560
hammering us on the doorstep to do

something about but why one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most</font>

59
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,900
unsettling things about the contention

within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Conservative Party was the</font>

lack of backlash from the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> media the USA is miles behind</font>

63
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,790
the UK on this issue but you've gotta

hand it to the American<font color="#CCCCCC"> gays they're</font>

65
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,290
really really militant about this and

66

they're fighting their asses off full

67

equality despite having a large number

of gay people who are out and open<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

70
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,070

why is the gay community quite happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

content with how far we've come do we

that this bill is probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

passed do you think that we still<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

and frank discussion about this topic in

100
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,269
our society maybe it's because we're

british and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like talking about</font>

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,600
looks like more Tory MPs will rebel over
