1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,620
YESTERDAY WE BROKE DOWN HOW
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,609
TAKING ALL THE WORK THAT THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID ON

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,020
RAISING FUEL EFFICIENCY
STANDARDS IN CARS, OF WHICH THEY

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,230
SET VERY AMBITIOUS TARGETS, AND
BY VERY AMBITIOUS I MEAN THEY

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,639
WOULD HELP CATCH US UP TO WHERE
THE REST OF THE WORLD IS, BUT IT

6
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:18,970
WAS BIG AND IT WAS LEADING TO
CAR COMPANIES MAKING MORE

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,020
EFFICIENT CARS.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,520
THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION IS TEARING THAT

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,550
UP, YOU CAN SAY GOODBYE TO ALL
OF THAT, WE HAVE GONE BACK 15

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,310
YEARS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN
TERMS OF FUEL EFFICIENCY.

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,310
TODAY

12
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,250
WE TURN TO THE CAR MANUFACTURERS
AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING BEHIND

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,920
THE SCENES TO HELP THE TRUMP
ADMINISTERED IN MAKING SURE THAT

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,110
OUR CARS ARE AS DIRTY AND
POLLUTING AND INEFFICIENT AS

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,199
POSSIBLE.

16
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:45,690
NOW THERE IS GOOD NEWS
COMING OUT OF CAR MANUFACTURERS,

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,780
THEY ARE DOING A LOT OF WORK ON
BOTH ELECTRIC CARS AND HYDROGEN

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,600
POWERED CARS, THEY ARE COMING
OUT WITH ONES THAT I THINK WILL

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,920
BE MORE APPEALING TO MORE
PEOPLE, ALL THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,719
BUT THAT IS THE FORWARD FACING
THING, THAT'S TO APPEAL TO

21
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:18,120
CONSUMERS, BEHIND THE SCENES
THEY ARE DOING SOME LOBBYING --

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,580
SO ON THE FRONT THEY SAY WE
EMIT LESS CARBON, WE ARE TOTALLY

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,720
EFFICIENT, IT'S AWESOME.

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,610
ON THE
BACK THEY ARE SAYING I DON'T

25
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,430
EVEN KNOW IF THAT SCIENCE IS ALL
THAT ACCURATE.

26
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,430
IS CARBON REALLY

27
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,710
CAUSING THE WORLD TO GET HOTTER?

28
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,710
ARE THESE EMISSIONS REALLY

29
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,850
LEADING TO SPIKES IN
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND

30
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,310
THINGS LIKE THAT?

31
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,500
AND ONE OF THE
THINGS WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:57,570
BIASED 
IS --

33
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,780
IF THAT BLOWS YOUR MIND AS A
VIEWER OF TYT IT'S PROBABLY

34
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,460
BECAUSE IT'S NOT REMOTELY TRUE,
BUT HE SAID IT --

35
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,940
THAT IS 100% COUNTERED BY ALL
THE SCIENCE WE HAVE --

36
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:18,439
AGAIN, SIMPLY UNTRUE.

37
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,159
AND
THEN HE INEVITABLY HAS TO DO

38
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,680
WHAT EVERY CLIMATE SCIENCE
DENIER DOES, IS IMPLY THAT

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:33,549
CARBON IS NATURALLY GOOD --

40
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:35,980
THAT'S AWESOME, SO WHY DON'T
WE PUT YOU IN A ROOM AND PUMP IT

41
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,079
WITH AS MUCH CO2 AS POSSIBLE
AND SEE HOW YOU FARE?

42
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:45,129
IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD FOR YOU, I
HEAR IT IMPROVES YOUR SKIN.

43
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:48,469
LIKE WHAT WE BREATHE OUT AND
WHAT THE TREES PROCESS, IT'S

44
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:52,049
THIS NICE NATURAL THING, SO YOU
CAN SUCK ON A TAILPIPE AND IT'S

45
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:53,400
COOL.

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,900
THAT'S WHO WROTE THIS
REPORT THAT THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY

47
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,639
TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION IS
GOING TO BE USING FOR SOME OF

48
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,920
THEIR ADVISORY ROLE WHEN IT
COMES TO CARS AND CLIMATE.

49
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,279
IT IS PROPAGANDA, THERE IS NO
TRUTH TO IT, BUT IT'S OUT THERE.

50
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:12,680
THIS DISINFORMATION MACHINE THEY
HAVE CREATED CONTINUES TO BE FED

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,219
BY ALL OF THESE SPECIAL INTEREST
GROUPS, IN THIS CASE IT'S THE

52
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,930
AUTOMOBILE LOBBY, BUT THEY
REALLY DON'T NEED IT TO WIN OVER

53
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,989
THIS ADMINISTRATION.

54
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:21,700
AS WE
HAVE SAID, THIS ADMINISTRATION

55
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,310
ONCE THESE ROLLBACKS, THEY DON'T
CARE ABOUT POLLUTION AND

56
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,950
EMISSIONS, THIS IS AS CANCER
RATES GO UP, AS SO MANY VICTIMS

57
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,060
OF THESE POLLUTANTS,
PARTICULARLY IN URBAN CENTERS,

58
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,779
CONTINUE TO BE REVEALED, WE GET
THIS KIND OF INFORMATION OUT

59
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:38,779
THERE.

60
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:41,400
AS I SAY IT'S NOT
FACT-BASED BUT IT'S PROPAGANDA

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,019
THAT WILL BE USED IN THE
ARGUMENT.

62
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,019
YOU WILL SEE MORE AND

63
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:47,019
MORE OF THIS, IT WILL BE
REPRINTED AND REGURGITATED BY

64
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,099
THIS ADMINISTRATION IN EVERY WAY
WHEN THIS ARGUMENT COMES UP.

65
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:55,400
AND LET'S BE CLEAR, EVERY TIME
YOU SEE A COMMERCIAL BY FORD,

66
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,669
GM, TOYOTA, WHERE THEY ARE
TOUTING THEIR FUEL-EFFICIENT

67
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:01,349
VEHICLES AND HOW THEY CARE ABOUT
THE ENVIRONMENT AND HOW THEY ARE

68
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:05,230
DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO CLEAN UP
THE POLLUTION, KEEP IN MIND THAT

69
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,139
BEHIND THE SCENES WHAT THEY ARE
REALLY DOING IS HIRING THIS

70
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:12,609
CLIMATE SCIENCE DENIER TO DO
THEIR BIDDING AND LOBBY ARE

71
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:16,849
ELECTED OFFICIALS TO CONTINUE
DEREGULATING WHATEVER

72
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:18,798
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS WE
HAVE.

73
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,310
THAT'S SHADY, SHADY.

74
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,870
I GUESS THE ONLY POSITIVE IS
THAT BECAUSE THEY OPERATE ON --

75
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,330
IN A CAPITALIST SYSTEM, WHILE
THEY WILL DO ALL THE STUFF THEY

76
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,620
DO AT THE END OF THE DAY HAVE TO
MAKE MONEY, AND THEY ARE

77
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,819
BETTING, AND THERE'S SOME
EVIDENCE IT WILL BE THE CASE,

78
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,520
THEY ARE BETTING THEY CAN TWIST
THE SYSTEM AND GET YOU TO BUY

79
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,759
HEAVILY POLLUTING SUVS THAT YOU
DON'T NEED AND ALL THAT STUFF,

80
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,379
THEY ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO
GET BACK TO THE 90S AND EARLY

81
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:48,760
2000S WHERE THEY WERE DOING
THAT, SELLING PEOPLE CARS THEY

82
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,910
DON'T NEED BECAUSE THEY COST
MORE MONEY AND THE PROFIT

83
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,569
MARGINS ARE HIGHER.

84
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:55,080
A COUPLE OF
YEARS AGO I OWNED A CHEVY, IT

85
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,919
WAS AN ELECTRIC CAR, I LOVED IT,
AND CHEVY DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN

86
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,169
ABOUT THAT CAR, THE DEALERSHIPS
DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT IT.

87
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,169
BUT

88
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,009
THANKFULLY IT SOLD WELL, SO THEY
COME OUT RECENTLY WITH THE CHEVY

89
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:11,960
VOLT AND I GUARANTEE CHEVY STILL
DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THAT

90
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,479
CAR, BUT IF PEOPLE BUY A LOT OF
THEM, AND AT LEAST IN LOS

91
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,280
ANGELES THEY ARE, THEY WILL MAKE
MORE, AND EVENTUALLY WE CAN DRAG

92
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,639
THEM INTO THE MODERN DAY AND
FORCE THEM TO MAKE CARS THAT ARE

93
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,990
GOOD BOTH FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS
AND THE WORLD AT LARGE, AND

94
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,349
HOPEFULLY FORCE THEM TO STOP
DOING THIS SORT OF THING.

95
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:31,789
LAST POINT ON THAT, THE
ECONOMICS WILL HELP DICTATE

96
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,699
WHERE THIS GOES AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU ARE SAYING, AND I THINK THE

97
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:43,330
OTHER COMPONENT OF THAT IS FUEL
PRICES, THEY CONTINUE TO GO UP.

98
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,590
AS A CONSUMER NOTION FUEL
EFFICIENCY WILL BECOME

99
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,389
IMPORTANT, AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE
FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES THEY

100
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,879
WILL GO TO ANOTHER COMPANY.

101
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:06,620
IN
THE MARKETPLACE MIGHT HELP THIS.

102
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,670
THEY ARE TRYING TO PROP UP OLD
ENERGY, DIRTY ENERGY LIKE COAL,

103
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,680
BUT IN THE END THE MARKETPLACE
WILL WIN OUT, AND IN THIS CASE I

104
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,550
THINK JOHN, WHO IS SUGGESTING
THOSE FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES,

105
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,430
THEY PROBABLY WILL BE OF GREATER
APPEAL TO THE CONSUMER, THAT'S

106
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,430
RIGHT.

107
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,440
I HOPE SO, AND THANK YOU FOR
MENTIONING THOSE TARIFFS AGAIN

108
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,849
ON THE SOLAR STUFF, IT'S SO SAD
TO SEE THAT WE HAVE THIS

109
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:33,569
OPPORTUNITY TO BE A WORLD LEADER
ON THIS SORT OF TECHNOLOGY, TO

110
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:37,970
ACTUALLY RAMP IT UP A LOT, IT'S
BECOME FAR MORE PRICE

111
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,889
COMPETITIVE WITH DIRTY FORMS OF
ENERGY, AND TO SEE THE TRUMP

112
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:57,250
ADMINISTRATION TRY TO HANDICAP
THE DEPLOYMENT OF CLEAN ENERGY

113
00:06:57,250 --> 00:00:00,000
IS DISHEARTENING.
