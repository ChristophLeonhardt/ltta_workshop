good evening from New York I'm dan Rather and if you're wondering whether it feels good to say that well it does but this is something new a newscast airing weekly on Monday nights an old TV newsman leaning on new media to connect with our future a collaboration between two organizations my own news and guts and the Young Turks by the way you may catch me talking with the team here off-camera sometime during our newscast we're a low tech but we have high aspirations this is an answer our answer to what TV news has become by the way this is my actual office my old partners desk that I treasure no bells no whistles we're gonna try to give you news analysis and commentary with as much context and perspective including historical context as possible on stories that matter to the real lives of real people I may sometimes tell you what I think not what to think I seek not to persuade you but to inform you we're launching this venture two days after the one year anniversary of president Trump's inauguration one day after the anniversary of the first women's March we'll close with my thoughts on why we're doing this and why we're doing it now but we begin with the end of the 2018 government shutdown excuse me the end of the 1st 2018 government shutdown today's deal to fund the government extends for only three weeks On February 8th perhaps we'll do it all again on Saturday the first day of the showdown president Trump's 2020 re-election campaign put out an ad blaming Democrats for this mess for the shutdown and for the quote murderers that will occur if Democrats kept their way on immigration that's illegal immigrant Louis bracamontes charged with murdering two police officers it's pure President Trump is right build the wall deport criminals stop illegal immigration now Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants President Trump will fix our border and keep our families safe I'm Donald Trump well Democrats said they agreed to a three-week extension because of a promise by Senate Republicans a promise to vote on daca the deferred action for childhood arrivals program which was immigrants brought here as children stay here in work we should note that when President Trump suspended daca he told Congress to restore it in legislative form Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told Democrats he will permit a voter in Dhaka on February 8th if Congress can't strike an overall immigration deal by that time Democratic whip dick Durbin took to the Senate floor to assure dreamers his party is not abandoning of them we have gathered the largest bipartisan group of senators to ever commit to moving forward on the DREAM Act and immigration we have a process I want to thank Senator McConnell for explicitly saying today it will be a level playing field it will be open to both sides we will move to the issue as you characterized it this morning of ducking immigration thank you for doing that I believe that that sets the stage for us to work together for the first time in five years we will have a debate on the floor of the Senate on the DREAM Act and immigration to all the dreamers who are watching today don't give up I know that your lives are hanging in the balance on what we do here on Capitol Hill and with the White House three weeks from now I hope to be joining you in celebrating the passage with you and your families and your communities of a measure which will strengthen America and you an opportunity to be part of our future of course no one asked the House of Representatives about all this which could mean that on February 8th we do it all over again holding the government hostage did not used to be a standard negotiating tactic the government and his functions were what each side fought for so if you see that I hear news reports later today and tonight that the crisis is over consider that it has merely slowed back down to its previous pace that's basically what's happened consider that shutdowns are - the way we govern today as combustion is to corrosion that is a sudden flare-up of a similar process already underway consider the vision of government made manifest in how this showdown rolled out uniformed military we're still on duty 96% of Housing and Urban Development staff sent home 87% of homeland security workers told to show up compared to 10% at the Department of Education and you get the idea now consider the slow-motion government shutdown try telling Puerto Rico the government shutdown is over more than a third of Puerto Rico remains without power on Wednesday before the showdown the newspaper el Nuevo Dia reported that the Trump administration is withholding a billion dollar loan to the island also last week the agency created to protect bank customers protect bank customers said it will not enforce a recent rule on payday lenders on Tuesday we learned that most of the National Park System advisory board as quit you get the idea and it most media ignore the year-long slow motion and shutdown if Democrats don't raise enough of a stink about it maybe it's because too many of us have signaled that we're on board when President Reagan said the scariest words are I'm from the government and I'm here to help we got the joke we laughed along but it was not always like this folks and that's something worth thinking about look the government when it works as it should work takes on big projects for the country as a whole think about President Eisenhower championing the building of the interstate highway system President Kennedy and President Johnson with let's send a man to the moon President Roosevelt with the safety net including Social Security go away back to Theodore Roosevelt who broke up the big mining and oil cartels the big corporate monopolies and also set the country in the course of conservation of some of our most important lands these were big projects they had the support of the country as a whole and presidents led those kinds of accomplishments we're capable of doing that again and I'm not here to praise president Trump but it should be noted that President Trump during the campaign he talked about all kinds of big projects you know infrastructure being one of them there are big projects that only the government representing all of the country all the country's people can accomplish and we've done this in the past and for those who question well I don't know now and with all the polarization where they can do it of course we can do it what it requires a national consensus on what needs to be done a president who will exert some leadership on it a Congress who will follow the president's leadership and expand on it I'll give you one of my favorites if you think about what then what kind of big project could we do now and keep in mind the context of this folks is this whole movement has been taking a long time the whole movement to convince the American people that the government is bad you know get the government out of our lives well first of all it's not really practical to do that and secondly well at least question whether it's a good idea what I was going to say if want something really get behind in which the overwhelming majority the country could get behind a president Trump presumably could get behind and we'd get something done is the top three priorities of this country you can make in case that the top three our priorities ought to be in order education education and education particularly revitalizing and reformed public school education which were so long was the absolute backbone in that country that aspire to the country and which really catapulted the country forward to making the 20th century our century was education education education that's just one of the examples if we're willing to think big if we're going to say of course government has a role in doing big things doesn't have to be going to Mars for example who's going to lead in the 21st century in developing artificial intelligence it's one of the big developments are going to expand this whole century or the Chinese gonna lead in that somebody else or a we gonna leave it that's the kind of big thing that government at its best and presidential leadership at his best can actually make happen now of course the parties will tell us that we will bounce from shutdown to shut down now because it is uniquely impossible to deal with President Donald Trump like negotiating with jello Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said but mr. Trump is less an anomaly that many admit is mr. Trump's intellect truly less robust than saying that a vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has America really blundered worse under Trump than it did by invading Iraq America did not teleport into 2018 we walked a path brightly lit by the neon warning signs of our past we have been down this path before and we do know the way back the way back among other things is not to have this idea that somehow another education is bad somehow another intellectualism is bad this there's a very dangerous virus so there's much of it coming from the leadership of the company of the country that somehow education is not so to be valued as it once was that somehow there's actually an anti science movement it's very clear anti science movement that we do we really want them is that pretty going to take us back and there was a time that long ago when scientists were among our biggest heroes finding for example a cure for polio and all kinds of accomplishments where does this come from this idea that well we don't need to think of a college education for nearly as many people who say once did you know I've said and I'll say again that the American people are pretty good separating brasstacks from bull shine and when someone tries to convince us that what this country needs is is really less education and particularly less higher education what this country needs is fewer scientists and less of an emphasis on on science that's not the way back that's not the way forward it never has been for the country and it can't be now now that's just what I think again I'm not telling you I'm really suggesting to you what you should think but in all of it maybe there are a few points to ponder I hope so now the Senate wants to confirm president Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services that's Obamacare Medicare Medicaid and health care costs we have an exclusive report about this man's past record of lowering health care costs on to you I'll tell you about that after this I see what we all say the deep divisions the endemic in justices the uncertainty about our future we have sometimes stumble we have sometimes fallen short but we can renew our national purpose if we recognize that what unites us is far greater and stronger than all that divides us look we're doing interviews over there at youtube.com slash tyt interviews and we've done some amazing ones recently of course you know the person most widely considered to be the most progressive senator is Bernie Sanders and exclusive tonight about president Trump's nominee to run Health and Human Services at cabinet position and about what it means to lower health care costs in this country right now Senate Republicans expect to confirm the nominee Alex a czar by the end of this month mr. HR was the top executive at Eli Lilly pharmaceuticals and as you might imagine got fairly interrogated by two Senate committees about drug prices so everybody's concerned about the rising drug prices but it turns out mr. SERR also serves on the board of directors at a company called HMS which specializes in quote containing health care costs documents from a czars year at HMS show that the company's focus was less about cutting costs and more about shifting the costs so HMS helps States and private companies shift costs of their health plans and on to other plans on the government health plans of a company health plans or on to the individuals themselves take Medicaid at a zones confirmation hearing a couple weeks ago Ohio senator sherrod Brown questioned him about whether he favors cutting Medicaid costs by imposing work requirements on Medicaid recipients all of us want to know exactly how you were how you could rationalize requiring individuals struggling with an illness whether it's cancer whether it's opioid addiction whether it's some kind of severe mental illness how how you will rationalize requiring individuals to struggling with those illnesses to work in order to remain eligible especially when such a requirement is indirect in direct contradiction to the objectives of Medicaid programming if you you consider someone with cancer to be able bodied what about an individual diagnosed with depression I would like you to do this I'd like you to please submit your proposed definition of able-bodied adult to this committee included in today's in the record included in today's hearings before this committee votes on your confirmation senator I don't have a proposed definition of able-bodied your imputing to me a desire that I have not stated in a letter last July however hm s quote strongly urged letting Wisconsin do just that imposed work requirements and other restrictions to qualify for Medicaid also while this mr. raiser was on the board the HMS company advocating making you sign an affidavit on whether your spouse has a job and qualifies for health care from that company and forcing you to prove your dependents really are your dependents the HMS company estimates that its suggestions can help companies disqualify about eight percent of workers dependents azar on the other hand reported receiving stock and options valued at more than one hundred thousand dollars for his year on the HMS board now by any reasonable analysis this is insidious it needs to be recognized it needs to be considered by the public at large what you have here is an ongoing effort this is just one example an ongoing effort to basically come after Medicaid to come out eventually Social Security but particularly when it comes to healthcare costs the idea is not a new idea but it's one has taken up some momentum in recent years is sort of take the US government as a representative of we the people out of decisions about such things as should drop prices go up or should the people as a whole have some leverage in negotiating that's what the government has been doing this is all an effort to say listen you turn the pricing of things over to the big pharmaceutical companies to the insurance companies and the hospitals which are increasingly owned by the insurance companies it's an effort to say you know let them sort of settle on what the price is going to be don't have the public at large through their government have any leverage that is what this is about you'll hear sis phrases well let the market decide on pharmaceuticals now I want to point out one thing to you we talked to health care insurance whistleblower wendell potter and he said companies like hms shift costs around and then add to those costs by charging for their services its total neglect to the governor abilities leverage scale to negotiate lower prices that's a lot about what this whole thing is about now we're gonna put up a link to our article on a czar and hms when we get around to the description for this video so if you want to know more about it go that route now I want to share my thoughts with you on why we're doing this program and I'll do that after this quick break an amazing power power like a smart Destiny's Child we're all too strong we start a revolution yes another one that's excited Wow so the best writers in the country are right here on this panel with the obvious exception of John I roll quickly discount Harry Potter fanfiction we have elected the top Twitter troll in the country what ran me away from Christianity was judgment and condemnation salting peaceful protesters in North Dakota crazier than bomb in Yemen crazier than bombing Syria so much they ran out of bomb reductive interpretation of what their motives are what Putin's are by these amateur you I know what you're thinking I love how you like you like lip you do something with your lips where you play the sound close and I'm like you see is he like lip-synching I don't know I never noticed it until you said it's a funny habit it's not look we're doing interviews over there at youtube.com slash tyt interviews and we've done some amazing ones recently so now of course you know the person most widely considered to be the most progressive senators Bernie Sanders why not backed up during the 2016 primaries why be a Democrat at all and we're in the time where it's cannot in good conscience sit on the sidelines of history in 2017 we're keeping an eye on other stories this week three top officials at USA Gymnastics including his chairman stepped down today some of the victims of team dr. Larry and Nash are blamed the organization which oversees national and Olympic teams for failing to act swiftly to protect the athletes in Israel today Vice President Mike Pence said America will open his embassy in Jerusalem by the end of next year several Israeli Arab lawmakers of the Knesset were removed for protesting pensive speech the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania today ordered lawmakers there to redraw their state congressional districts which have been called some of the most gerrymandered in the country the court said that the existing congressional lines violate the state constitution by tilting the map in favor of Republican candidates The Washington Post today reported that when president Trump's voting commission as Texas ports voter data they asked the state to identify every voter with an Hispanic last name that Commission was disbanded in the face of legal challenges and political uproar its work however will be taken up by the Department of Homeland Security we'll be keeping an eye on that now in closing tonight a word about why we're doing this program the purpose we hope to serve in a time of deep entrenched political polarization in a time when the chasms that divide us seemed impossible to bridge it's tough to see those on the other side and how do we reconcile with what we cannot recognize the American Left used to ridicule the concept of evil but sees evil now atop branch of government the American right used to sneer at emotionalism but now gives us politicians whose policies come from their gut and their heart American media was supposed to inform us of what we were doing but now stages punching Judy debates over who we are you know we are united in more ways that we know or at least that we often think about it turns out most of us agree that our president has divided us toxic beliefs or sometimes shallow beliefs young men grew up and learned empathy even though guys can work at being woke but first we must get past what is shallow I'm doing this program because we've all let silly season run into extra innings all of us not just the news and this isn't about faith news like science real news is not a body of facts it's a process real journalism is not infallibility its transparency good journalism is knowing that the most insidious bias isn't political it's practical it's when TV news executives ignore a story they don't know how to tell because it's boring meaning it doesn't affect them or their loved ones or their wallet meanwhile the target demo fills up stadiums to hear Bernie Sanders lectures on financial regulation as we speak one-third of Puerto Rico is in the dark still in the dark Americans not yet born are imperiled by environmental degradation American weapons are turning Yemen into a plague pit women still earn less than men while fighting for our children's health and their own reproductive rights people of color suffer systemic discrimination not just on horrific police videos but out of sight as banks and lenders still deny them access to credit we have a long way to go and we will not get there by dwelling on speculation about who will get indicted or elected those diversions leave the powers that be for you to take us back and take us down well not on my watch not if I can help it I'd like to say I'm a reporter who got lucky very lucky along the way I was mentored and inspired by journalists who preached the importance of the role of the press as a constitutional check on power what that requires is fair and accurate reporting it requires a shared sense of the truth and it requires the time and space to pause and reflect my hope is that's what this program will provide at least some of the time I look forward to hearing from you as to how you think how well you think we're doing or how badly now why the Young Turks well for one thing because they asked me and because I wanted to speak to people who care about the future and want to build a better one especially some of our younger citizens I wanted to let you know that our politics today is not who we are it never has been who we are is who we aspire to be it always has been so I'm here to share what I've seen this taught me that our aspirations have no limits we can be who we choose to be we can fill the streets run for office if we pay attention and do the work we might just build a more perfect union with that I'll leave you for this new cycle The Young Turks is next and we'll be back with the news at this same place in time 5:30 Eastern every Monday until then dan Rather reporting stay steady I see what we all say the deep divisions the endemic in justices the uncertainty about our future we have sometimes stumble we have sometimes fallen short but we can renew our national purpose if we recognize that what unites us is far greater and stronger than all that divides us look we're doing interviews over there at youtube.com slash tyt interviews and we've done some amazing ones recently so now of course you know the person most widely considered to be the most progressive senators Bernie Sanders why not back from during the 2016 primaries why be a Democrat at all and we're in the time where you cannot in good conscience sit on the sidelines of history you
