LAST NIGHT.

9
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:19,356
STATISTICS FROM BORDER PATROL

10
00:00:19,357 --> 00:00:22,159
ILLEGAL CROSSINGS ARE UP 30% IN

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,728
FISCAL YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO

12
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:25,863
FISCAL YEAR 2017.

13
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:27,064
THE PRESIDENT LAYING THE BLAME

14
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:28,232
FOR THAT INCREASE AND BLAME FOR

15
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,334
THE CARAVAN AT THE FOOT OF THE

16
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:31,302
DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR

17
00:00:31,303 --> 00:00:32,703
STONEWALLING HIS EFFORTS TO

18
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:34,371
REFORM IMMIGRATION LAWS.

19
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:36,173
THE PRESIDENT HAS FOUND

20
00:00:36,174 --> 00:00:36,974
PARTICULARLY IN COMPETITIVE

21
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:39,543
SOUTHERN STATES THE CARAVAN IS

22
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:40,945
AN ISSUE THAT REALLY ENERGIZES

23
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:41,278
VOTERS.

24
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:42,379
LISTEN HERE.

25
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,315
>> President Trump: YOU KNOW

26
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:46,617
HOW THE CARAVAN STARTED?

27
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:47,551
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAD

28
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:49,186
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AND NOW

29
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:51,989
THEY ARE SAYING I THINK WE MADE

30
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,923
A BIG MISTAKE.

31
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:54,325
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SEEING HOW

32
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:55,159
BAD IT IS.

33
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,094
HOW PATHETIC IT IS.

34
00:00:57,095 --> 00:00:58,762
HOW BAD OUR LAWS ARE.

35
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:01,665
THEY MADE A BIG MISTAKE.

36
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,534
>> THE PRESIDENT IS VOWING TO

37
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:05,002
CUT AID TO CENTRAL AMERICAN

38
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:06,103
COUNTRIES FOR LETTING ALL THE

39
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:08,005
PEOPLE IN THE CARAVAN LEAVE AND

40
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:09,406
VOWING TO PUT THE U.S. MILITARY

41
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:11,041
ON THE BORDER TO STOP THE

42
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:11,976
CARAVAN FROM CROSSING.

43
00:01:11,977 --> 00:01:13,611
HE SAYS HE HAS ALERTED THE

44
00:01:13,612 --> 00:01:13,978
PENTAGON.

45
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,112
SO FAR NO INDICATIONS THAT

46
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:16,447
MILITARY IS HEADED FOR THE

47
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:17,715
BORDER BUT THE CARAVAN IS STILL

48
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:19,483
WEEKS AWAY FROM THE UNITED

49
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:20,651
STATES AS WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE

50
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:21,352
JUST REPORTED.

51
00:01:21,353 --> 00:01:22,987
THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO KEEPING AN

52
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:25,256
EYE ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE

53
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:27,258
KILLING OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI.

54
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:30,828
NOT REALLY BUYING INTO WHAT THE

55
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:31,528
SAUDIS ARE SAYING.

56
00:01:31,529 --> 00:01:34,565
THE CIA DIRECTOR IS IN TURKEY

57
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,000
NOW CONDUCTING HER OWN

58
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:36,934
INVESTIGATION TALKING TO

59
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:37,434
TURKISH OFFICIALS.

00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:40,671
STATES SOON TO BRIEF THE

62
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:42,573
PRESIDENT ON WHAT SHE FOUND BUT

63
00:01:42,574 --> 00:01:44,975
BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE

64
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:45,910
PRESIDENT INDICATING THEY DON'T

65
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:46,810
LIKE WHAT THEY'VE HEARD FROM

66
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:48,612
THE SAUDIS SO FAR.

67
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:49,446
LISTEN HERE.

68
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:51,582
>> President Trump: I WILL KNOW

69
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,049
VERY SOON.

70
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,551
I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH WHAT

71
00:01:54,552 --> 00:01:55,252
I'VE HEARD.

72
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:56,654
>> THE WORD FROM PRESIDENT

73
00:01:56,655 --> 00:02:01,091
ERDOGAN THIS MORNING THAT THIS

74
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:04,261
BRUTAL MURDER WAS

75
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:05,029
PRE-MEDITATED, PRE-PLANNED DAYS

76
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,564
IN ADVANCE FLIES IN THE FACE OF

77
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:08,732
EARLIER ASSERTIONS THAT HAVE

78
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:11,302
BEEN MADE BY THE SAUDI REGIME.

79
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:11,835
IT UNDERSCORES THE

80
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:12,970
DETERMINATION OF OUR

81
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:14,004
ADMINISTRATION TO FIND OUT WHAT

82
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:15,973
HAPPENED HERE.

83
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:17,408
>> IT'S LIKELY THERE WILL HAVE

84
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:18,809
TO BE SOME SORT OF WHITE HOUSE

85
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,911
RESPONSE TO THE KILLING OF

86
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:21,612
JAMAL KHASHOGGI.

87
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:25,115
WHAT IT IS, THOUGH, REMAINS IN

88
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:25,582
QUESTION.

89
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,517
THE PRESIDENT HAS REPEATEDLY

90
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:27,918
SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO

91
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,155
ANYTHING THAT WOULD AFFECT THE

92
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:32,222
$100 BILLION ARMS DEAL THAT HE

93
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:33,757
SIGNED A YEAR AGO.

94
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:35,392
HE DOESN'T WANT TO AFFECT THE

95
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:36,026
GENERAL TRADE BETWEEN THE

96
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:38,128
UNITED STATES AND SAUDI ARABIA.

97
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,296
A VERY FINE LINE THE PRESIDENT

98
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:40,931
WILL HAVE TO WALK HERE.

99
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:43,534
IF IT STAYS OUTSIDE THE ORBIT

100
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:44,802
OF THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY HE

101
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:46,337
WILL FIND IT EASIER TO PUT A

102
00:02:46,338 --> 00:00:00,000
SANCTION ON SAUDI ARABIA
