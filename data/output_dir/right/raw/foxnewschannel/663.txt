GOVERNOR HAS FREED AT LEAST FOUR

15
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:30,719

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,453
OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE TRYING TO GET

00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:48,537

00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:55,277
WE DO NOT KNOW THEIR CONDITION.

31
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:58,280
THE GOVERNOR SAID THAT HE HAD

32
00:00:58,281 --> 00:00:59,281
SPOKEN WITH AT LEAST ONE OF THEM

33
00:00:59,282 --> 00:01:01,750

00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:03,986
PERFECT -- THIS IS A PERFECT

00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:04,353
SITUATION.

00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:05,754
HE DIDN'T GO INTO MUCH DETAIL

37
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:06,355
ABOUT THEIR CONDITION.

38
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:07,356
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE

39
00:01:07,357 --> 00:01:08,523

00:01:08,524 --> 00:01:10,158

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,194

00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:12,494
