recently from Planned Parenthood the butchery in Keystone Pennsylvania the tweet reads quote we Disney Princess who's had an abortion we need a Disney Princess who's pro-choice we need a Disney Princess who's an undocumented immigrant we need a Disney princess who's actually a union worker we need a Disney princess who's trans which is a print I would make them a Disney Prince this is intersectionality at its finest intersectionality is the theory that we all need to gang up regardless of our own groups we need to gang up to attack the white straight male who knows he's a male devil not it not just any white straight male because he could be trans you got a there's just one bad guy in them the rest of us need to gang up and fight that guy that's why it all comes in white who cares about union workers in the Planned Parenthood tweet because it's this brilliant little ideology it's an incoherent ideology but it's brilliant because it unites all of the aggrieved groups the allegedly aggrieved groups against the the bad guy which is the straight white man who thinks that he's a man in the old days you hear Louis Farrakhan yelling about the white devil now it's much more specific as a straight white man who thinks he's a man devil the idea that we need to have a disney princess who has an abortion is a big shift that has happened recently in the view of abortion on the left in the same week we had this video come out from jordan peterson who has said that abortion is clearly wrong and nobody would ever consider it a positive good here's Jordan abortion is clearly wrong I don't think anybody debates that you wouldn't recommend that someone that you love have one and nobody debates that says Jordan but I don't know if he's saying this for rhetorical effect it is clearly wrong he's absolutely right nobody would seriously debate that but plenty of frivolous people do debate that they try to make it a debate even though it obviously isn't we know that people debate this we know that some people pretend that it's a positive good and not just a bad thing since Hillary Clinton you know Hillary Clinton used to say it should be safe legal and rare right saying abortion is a bad thing but whatever we should tolerate it for some reason we're way past that now they can't handle that cognitive dissonance they shout your abortion movement encouraged women who were sucked into this awful choice this traumatic choice that in many cases ruins people's lives not just the lives of the kids but the lives of the people who do it now you have to pretend to be proud of that here's just the first YouTube result that comes up when you look up the shout your abortion movement my name is Sammy debt sir and I had an abortion on May 20th 2014 and here are a list of things that happened on that day I had a blueberry Danish for breakfast I walked from my apartment to the Madison Street clinic I received free health care from apple health on that day i sat with my best friend in the waiting room while let it go by idina menzel played over the intercom I took three vicodin I laughed really really hard in the clinic I cried really really hard in the clinic I had a small glass of orange juice in the waiting room afterwards and I hugged the nurse who was there watching to make sure I didn't get sick i Aydin ancelotti at the Mexican restaurant across the street I took a three hour long nap and then I went to rehearsal that night and here are a list of things that didn't happen I didn't feel sad I didn't feel angry I didn't feel hurt I didn't feel abandoned I didn't tell the person who got me pregnant and I didn't look back it is so hard to watch that because everything about that second part is a lie it's demonstrably a lie you can tell I mean she's holding back tears in the video and of course the question is who are you trying to convince who are you trying to convince with this he obviously you're looking back that's the definition of what you're doing right now obviously you were sad you you've said that you cried and you're she's on the verge of tears even describing this obviously she was abandoned and alone she had to hug the nurse she had to hug a stranger that this the the amount of sympathy that anyone would feel for this woman is awful the regret is pouring out of her pores it's you can tell she doesn't believe it she's trying to convince herself to believe these lies that she's saying notice in the beginning she said here's what happened on that day everything she acknowledges that happened is material it's all physical she doesn't say you know I felt this and then I thought about this and then I had this idea and I knew that this meant this she doesn't she says I ate a Danish she says I ate a Danish I took a bunch of drugs because this is a horrible thing I knew it was a horrible thing and I had had to numb the pain and then I ate a burrito I ate i drugged myself I ate I did this I did but there's no metaphysical experience she's denying all of the metaphysical she said I didn't feel I didn't feel this I didn't feel this I didn't feel this of course you did you can't the only way that you could get yourself to have an abortion is to deny the metaphysical to say this is just a clump of cells right it's not a person with a soul it's not a baby it's not a human it's just material and I ate the burrito and I took the drugs it's really I mean you just feel so awful for this woman and then to be used by the abortion movement to be used and paraded on there and say tell them it's a good thing oh and hold back those tears we don't want any tears in here and tell them you're not looking back as you look back in this issue there are two options repentance or doubling down you can change your mind you can say that was a bad thing I did I know people who have had abortions you can change your mind or you can deny the reality you can deny deny deny until you deny till you die is the Italian American expression deny didn't happen it didn't happen you know how you know by the way they talk about pro-choice the comments are disabled on this video tells you everything you need to know about pro-choice pro-freedom pro-choice comments are disabled because they know what the comments would say we know what her comments would be if she were speaking honestly if she weren't if she didn't have to hold back the tears they they have to make this a positive good it's not enough to say abortion isn't evil but we have to tolerate it for some reason it's not enough to do safe legal and rare which is the old Hillary Clinton example they have to move into the totalitarian principle it is enunciated by th white in the one and future king he said everything which is not forbidden is compulsory this is a play on the constitutional principle of English law everything which is not forbidden is allowed right that's what freedom is everything that's not forbidden is allowed but the totalitarian principle a play on that is everything that's not forbidden is compulsory it's the sign above the ant colony in the book totalitarianism cannot accept freedom totalitarian is a totalitarian frameworks rather are too fragile so the the framework of life the moral framework and the physical framework of totalitarianism cannot tolerate freedom it's too disconnected from reality there's a great line about the Soviet Union in the Soviet Union the future was always certain but the past was always changing they would have to rewrite the past they would have to rewrite what reality is because their fantasy their delusion was absolutely certain but and when reality disagrees with that reality has to be denied people have to be erased out of history the circumstances of history have to be changed there's no room for freedom and there's no room for free thought absurd moral frameworks that permit abortion they are too fragile to permit free thought so you have to say I didn't I didn't feel sad well you just said you cried afterwards yeah why didn't I didn't feel sad I did I wasn't alone you had to hug the nurse no one was with you you were alone you know I know that's not true I ate a Danish I ate a Danish I ate a burrito I did that I'm not of moral being I'm not a spiritual being I'm just a it's just physical but no one believes that you can tell she doesn't believe nobody believe that's what Jordan Peterson is saying there can be no disagreement tolerated on abortion and the reason that the pro-abortion movement can't tolerate it is that any rational discussion of abortion shows that it is clearly wrong this is at Peterson's entire point if you think about this for more than two seconds you'll realize that it's wrong so we can't permit that it's just a shout shout your abortion don't reasonably discuss it don't think it through don't think it through for a second just shout it and do it and do it again and shout it you didn't feel what you know you felt just shout it shout shout over people on this day in history in 1992 several hundred thousand people marched on Washington for abortion rights this was really the the last major gasp of the pro-abortion movement there was another flare-up in 2005 protesting both bushes bush 1 and bush 2 other other than that other than those little flare-ups that they come for pro-abortion the march for life the march against abortion is the longest continuous protest in American history grows every single year now it has presidential recognition President Trump addressed the March for life this year the opinions have changed dramatically and it's because we because we have permitted freedom on this topic as freedom has been allowed to expand and the totalitarian principle has been ignored the opinion has changed in the direction of pro-life I'll explain those numbers and explain why that happens but before we do that we have to we have to thank another sponsor we get to thank another sponsor this is a sponsor that I personally love very much I use all of the products that I get as little freebies you know because obviously Ben hasn't paid me in many months I don't know if he's ever he paid me for the bet on the election day that's the last time so yeah I have to love Bowl and branch this is a really good this this you know I am a guy who spends a lot of time in bed about 22 hours a day and so it's really nice when you have high quality sheets one thing we can all agree on is we need more sleep even I don't get 23 it's sometimes I don't even get 24 hours getting a great night's sleep is easier and more affordable than you think you don't need a new expensive mattress you don't need sleeping pills you just need to change your sheets that's why you should check out Boland branch everything they make from bedding to blankets is made from pure 100% organic cotton that's why they start out super soft and they get even softer over time now you can buy directly from them so you're basically getting wholesale prices I didn't know this because I would just sleep on sandpaper for most of my life I'd go out behind the superstore and just rip sandpaper around whatever it's sleep on it was cheap you know but it turns out you can get really nice sheets you know that you get it really high-end hotels and things like that those sheets cost like $1,000 or more than it cost more than that bolon brand should go directly to them those sheets are only a couple of hundred bucks I mean that is a really good discount you cut out the huge luxury middleman everyone who tries Boleyn branch loves them that's why they have thousands of five-star reviews Forbes The Wall Street Journal Fast Company are all talking about bow and branch three u.s. presidents sleep on Boland branch sheets and one best-selling author of a book that isn't really a book three presidents and one guy who didn't write a book that's a good

calm promo code michael mi CH AE l if you work at a coffee shop you're probably gonna spell that in many creative ways and flip all the consonants in the bells promo code mi CH AE L okay that can do it according to a Marist Poll from the end of last year the majority of women the majority of American women support making abortion illegal in 99% of cases that's not what you'll hear on television that's not what you're here on CNN the majority of American women 52 percent according to this poll last year say that women's support making abortion illegal in all but rape incest life of the mother and all but 1% of cases they support that so the pro-abortion fanatics have to shout they have to enforce their orthodoxy freethought is not allowed they've become much more hysterical it's it's something that we have to hunker down we're not allowed to deal freely in these ideas we have to gang up with other imaginary victim groups they have to further divorce their own deluded visions from reality to discuss that delusion we will be joined by the official Michael Knowles show Disney Princess correspondent princess faith Moore herself who recently published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal called planned princess hood and coincidentally on this day in history Pocahontas married English tobacco planter John Rolfe in Jamestown Virginia now of course if a Planned Parenthood and the feminists over at Disney had their way she'd have just met John Walsh Oh John Rolfe and then had a one-night-stand of casual sex and gotten pregnant that had an abortion and then and only then would Pocahontas be empowered but fortunately that wasn't the case your highness your highness princess Moore thank you for being here thanks for having me it's a pleasure to be here so why is Planned Parenthood specifically targeting Disney Princesses yeah that's that is the question and the answer is Disney princesses are really influential little girls love princesses and they love Disney princesses and no matter how much the feminists in general have tried to stop them from living princesses they still love them so now what they're doing instead of saying you know don't love princesses love lab technicians love doctors love you know whoever sports players they're like okay well that's not working fine now we're gonna redefine what a princess actually is right and you know now it's somebody who you know play sports or fights with swords or have abortions they're using the princesses as tools for propaganda because the girls love them so much so they say we can't turn your attention to GI Joe or whatever so we're just going to turn the princess into GI Joe Disney Princesses made it a long time before feminists tried to ruin them they made a many decades what changed and when so that's an interesting question so the the first three princess movies happened under Walt Disney's watch right so they happened you know from 1939 up until around 1966 and that's when you get like Cinderella and Snow White and Sleeping Beauty and then and then there was what what they call the Dark Ages right doesn't he died they didn't make any princess movies there were a lot of sort of really terrible movies and some good movies and then they came back with the Renaissance and the Renaissance is the movie are the movies that we sort of think of when we think Disney like the Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast and the Latin and all of those movies and and what happened when they were making those movies is that all of a sudden people were starting to say like you know those earlier princesses they were kind of you know they were kind of damsels in distress they sort of were sitting around waiting for men to come and save them so we're gonna update them and but the reason that those movies are actually so good still is that they updated them but kept the trope of princess in tact and so in a fairy tale and this is what the feminists don't understand in a fairy tale the trope of princess means something it's a symbol for sort of the feminine ideal like the perfect woman she's not a real person she's an ideal I mean everything in a fairy tale is really a symbol you know like the forest is a symbol for you know your inner turmoil and all of these things and so that's what a princess is and so when those Renaissance movies came back they updated the princesses to make them more realistic but they didn't take away the the sort of inner goodness of the princess but they had that idea that idea that like those other princesses are not okay and we need to somehow make them make them better make them feminists and and that pendulum just kind of kept swinging kept swinging till it was like it was sort of in the perfect place in Beauty and the Beast and then it was like husbands kind of annoying and then you know then you get Pocahontas move on I know everybody loves LAN I'm sorry about Milan you know and then Merida from brave princesses that are just basically just sort of tools for propaganda for a feminist ideology right what a woman should be and and one of them was elected to the US Senate that that is that is a real accomplishment for Disney clearly it's worked in some ways that issue of bringing down the ideal obviously I've noticed this not just in Disney but throughout culture and I wonder how much of this has to do with the democracy of it all because we're a democratic culture lowercase D and we love we talk extol the virtues of democracy all the time princesses are or literally aristocratic they are the aristocracy but the idea of the princess is the idea of the heir they appeal to aristocratic ideals to nobility to things that are above that which is common democracy does away with all of those things democracy is hostile to those things how much of the degradation of Disney Princesses can we simply blame on the hyper democratization steamrolling over aristocratic ideals in our in our whole culture we've lost you this is the Rio my gosh I was on the edge of my seat I want to hear about this and we've already got you princess you're back I thought you were being stolen away by some evil villain and I was gonna have to go through the woods and find you I don't know I haven't watched a lot of these movies do we have you back no you're gone again this is really sad I am going to have to go I'm gonna jump through the woods and I'm gonna run you know with my sword and turn into a frog and I don't know what happens in these things but this is gonna be my chance to save the princess I'm gonna get to put my money where my mouth is doo am I really just some paltry you know lowercase D Democrat in America it was some commoner or am i a virtuous knight a virtuous Prince going to save Drew's daughter let's see do you think we can get her back or no because I'm perfectly willing to give my my view of all of this my very elitist and aristocratic view do faith do we have you yeah I'm back oh thank goodness I was so nervous that you would fallen asleep and you know we'd have I don't know something but I'm back I I think it was the evil witch of feminism just the evil ideal of feminism is going in attacking my question is how much all of this has to do with the democracy of it all you know princesses are aristocratic they're literally the aristocracy they appeal to aristocratic ideals to nobility things that are above the common level of culture and democracy does away with those things our democracy does away with that it's hostile to the elite to the noble how much of the degradation of Disney Princesses can we blame on the steamrolling democratization constantly trying to be more democratic more equal more egalitarian over what were once aristocratic and elitist ideals well I think we're talking about is basically we've forgotten that this idea of princess means something else we think it means a princess and that's when all the feminists get all up in arms about like her tiara and brass and you know and what that means to little girls but that actually isn't the point the point is really that a princess is sort of this highborn lady the highest ideal of femininity and women hood and so when we start to think about it like that like oh she's really the princess there feels like serfs and that's not what it's at all and I quote but it is and we think about it that we begin this sort of misunderstanding and the way from ideal that were supposed to be kind of seeking it on that's absolutely right it was predicted by Edmund Burke and others to see that happening and a very sorry too to see that happen but hey at least we have VHS we can watch Snow White you know that that's kind of a cultural observation in general we can go retire to our country clubs and you know read all of the great dancers that's right turn it off smoke a cigar there's always hope springs eternal in the human breast princess your highness excellent to have you here I'm glad we were able to rescue you from the feminist demons of Skype and let us know if you have any more technological troubles and we will go and ride in on white horses and save you I will I will come to you thank you wonderful good to see you faith thanks for having me great to see it alright let's try to get into the mailbag a little bit think we can do one or two questions and then I have to say goodbye to those of you who are on Facebook and YouTube first question from Spencer o soir theist of empty book NOLs you have said that you enjoy the music of Frank Sinatra and have quoted some of his songs on the show what are your favorite Sinatra songs and albums and what other types of music do you enjoy Spencer I do love Sinatra I had a Sinatra esque fedora since I was like nine years old or something I when I was in fourth grade I sang with my elementary school orchestra playing I did young at heart I loved sin I probably know every Sinatra song one of my favorites is That's Life that's life that's what all the people say you're riding high in April shot down in May because it's the most conservative song ever written maybe other than man in the mirror by Michael Jackson but I loved that one of the greatest albums ever made in pop music is in the wee small hours by Sinatra that's one of those moody things when you're driving along the highway smoking a cigarette feeling bad for yourself you know it's a kind of cloudy around you that's a great a great album really I guess the first concept album probably in pop music as for other popular music and by that I mean I don't mean Ke$ha I mean like post-world War One all of the American Songbook Dean Martin Nat King Cole all those guys Elvis I love Elvis I'm a profound Elvis fan some Motown some soul I have a soft spot for Van Morrison in pre pop music I love Bach and Mozart and Hyden and Handel and all those guys for even older stuff because we get very myopic in our culture I talk about how conservatives are Philistines and you know even conservatives but college kids today especially they don't have any culture they don't know of anything that happened before yesterday they do think they I actually think that Tide Pods are the most delicious dessert in history and they're very good but they're not the most delicious they're other that creme brulee and things like that so I there's a great album on Spotify if you want to go all the way back basically some of the earliest music you can find there is songs from the time of the Crusades is a good one called AB joy at up Joe Evans ma PI's try that and then you'll get into like a very very old-school Sensibility you'll start chanting it'll be very good for your mindset next question from clay godfather of troll you often say that's funny that's quite a coincidence you often say that some conservatives act like Philistines I'm not familiar with this saying what does it mean clay you proved my point pal I'm sorry to say Philistines it means they are uncultured or they don't like culture or they're hostile to culture the the word came into common usage after a confrontation between college students and the locals in Germany in I think the 17th century so right around that time when the university was getting very very popular this was from a it's from the Bible you know the Philistines are upon you that's the quote and it's let you know it's not just you know these crazy tribes trying to conquer the Israelites it's saying you know you're so hostile to culture it's like the barbarians at the gates you don't you don't participate in this culture at all so don't be a Philistine don't it's good not to be a Philistine we're all sort of Philistines because nobody reads books anymore myself included only Andrew Clavin has read all the books so it's good to try to diminish your Philip Philistine ISM next well try to do one more than I got a say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube from Ben I've noticed that you've made frequent references to the ancient Athenian historian Thucydides in your podcast and at least once in your writings or not in my writings what what you're referring to is that I dedicate reasons to vote for Democrats I use the same introduction to that book that Thucydides did for his history of the Peloponnesian War I said this is not an essay to win the applause at the moment but a contribution for all time and which is true who was true for through Saturday's it's true of my magnum opus as well the question goes on I find his history of the Peloponnesian were fascinating and relevant to the modern day you're probably familiar with how the Greek city-states created a coalition called the Delian League shortly after the Persian Wars based on the notion that there were strongest when united against Persia unfortunately over time that became dominated by Athens became the Athenian Empire that demanded tribute from member states used military force to keep them in line it was this tyranny against the Spartans that brought on the Peloponnesian War while I do not believe that modern supranational organizations like the EU have reached that level of malignancy of the Athenian Empire a and help but notice similarities the one state had Germany of Germany over the you the owner astac s is required by Brussels the anti-democratic leanings of the EU suggestions that they form an EU army the populist backlash like brexit does the work of Thucydides demonstrate that supranational organizations are doomed to fail it does it actually says more than that though and this is a very conservative idea which is that you should keep the government as local as you can the more local the government the more responsive it will be the better will be the freer that you will be you have to be very careful now the lesson from the Thucydides from the Peloponnesian War is not that supranational organizations are bound to fail it's that's even national organizations right that's through cities would have said that you keep it in the polis in in just the city-state because you know the the Athenian Empire United not even all of Greece just part of Greece Athenian Imperial democracy wasn't supranational it wasn't even national so you have to be very careful this could apply to national organizations or even regional organizations too we have to be very careful with these organizations some supranational or international organizations have worked out well NATO has worked out well certainly in the 20th century some have not worked out well like the European Union which has been mostly a spectacular failure for national sovereignty and for culture and you know like Germany is the worst country in the history of the world I'm gonna have to do a whole show on this from the fall of Rome to the present but you know they tried to destroy the world once in the 20th century we beat them they tried to do it again 20 years later we beat them and then we gave them control of Europe and they've done it again a surprise surprise we have to be very very careful of these and use them for very specific purposes when you have these super national organizations that just are there they're just peering and watching you and just kind of encroaching more and more on your Liberty get rid of them that's no good I've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube I'm sorry that's what I have to do if you're at Daley wire calm thank you very much you help us keep the lights on here we actually just had an earthquake here before the show so hopefully no equipment was damaged if it was more of you have to go over and subscribe that would be very nice what do you get it's $10 a month for an annual membership you get me you get the inter Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show none of that matters you get Andrew flavin on the conversation that's gonna be a really good one that's coming up you'll obviously you can ask questions in the mailbag everybody can listen to the questions but only members can ask those questions many are called but few are chosen none of that matters the leftist here's tumblr when that earthquake just happened right before our show I assumed it was a a loud national groaning and screaming and wailing of a gnashing of teeth because I was going to talk about how awful abortion is and the first thing I reached for I didn't try to protect the producers I didn't even try to protect my own life I just grabbed the leftist tears tummy I knew that this would be the key because when the deluge comes in that that earthquake happens and then the tsunami of leftist years engulfed me I just hold this right in front of my face now catch them all and I can protect myself you need to protect yourself and your family to go to daily wired.com we'll be right back with more mailbag next question from nathan michael i think you are right about the silent majority in the short term but your justification proves been right Nixon's silent majority turned on him after the Tet Offensive thanks to commie Cronkite as you point out they are flakes who scatter to the wind at the first sign of trouble been correctly stayed true to conservative values over temporary electoral power what good is a Republican Congress of conservatives who aren't true conservatives with a capital T and a capital C and a trademark sign above them so I think what we're debating once again is the election of Donald Trump where I said it was a good idea to do it we should conservatives should take what we can get and and other conservatives said no he's just too awful I can't lend him my support I think I'm right about this I still think I'm right about this you're right that the Reagan Democrats as they were once called er the silent majority as Richard Nixon called them were the Trump Democrats that the populist people as Trump would refer to them they are not conservatives they don't share our political views entirely they're not certainly not ideological and they join coalition's with us for many good reasons by the way many good reasons that conservatives might want to take a look at like the preservation of tradition and common sense beyond theory very often the the Reagan Democrats of the silent majority are people who say yeah your theory is fine but let's look at reality and then the ideological people say who cares if it works in practice does it work in theory in the long term we're all dead there was a fear that if we elect this person or support this person then 40 years from now something bad will happen a politics doesn't happen in the future politics happens in real time politics is things that happen in the real world and it doesn't happen like it happens in philosophy books it happens in real time and space we should take the wins that we can get because you say that we the Trump voters have been proven wrong you say that the people who didn't vote for Trump had been proven right because of some big budget there was an omnibus budget bill that went through the Trump said he didn't like very much well okay but let's look at the other side if the people who didn't vote for Trump who said we shouldn't vote for him because he's too yucky and we don't like him if they had their way we would have a much more abortion we would have known Mexico City rule we would have know we would have the Obamacare mandate we would have massive regulation as opposed to the massive deregulation that we've had we would have a radical Supreme Court justice that Hillary Clinton would have appointed who would have gutted the first and second amendments as she promised in her campaign we would have had more weakness overseas as we had for the last eight years that Hillary Clinton was personally involved in by the way when she was Secretary of State we would have had it who knows in the future what would have happened with the federal courts because it's not just the one place on the Supreme Court Donald Trump has stacked the court with a federal judges we'd have no attack tax reform we would have perhaps higher taxes we would it go on and on and on and on and people say yes well okay what those were some victories okay Heritage Foundation says this has been the most conservative first year in the history of modern politics okay they if President Trump is enacted two-thirds of our agenda but you know what about ten years from now what about a big budget come on ma'am this is reality that deal in reality X is reality and if you say well I don't want to have a huge swath of the American population the silent majority or the Reagan Democrats I don't want to be associated with them because I don't agree with them on everything okay good luck you know good go vote for the Libertarian candidate or the Green Party candidate or whatever and I hope you feel very proud of yourself and very morally pure but that that doesn't do very much for the country doesn't do any good for the country and the Lord act and put it very well he said at all times the Friends of Liberty are a few they achieve their ends I'm paraphrasing he said it much nicer than I did they achieved their ends by associating with auxiliaries whose goals differ from their own and this involves a lot of moral risk you have you have to risk your own integrity and your own morality by supporting someone who isn't perfect obviously isn't perfect is eminently imperfect but that's the only way to achieve political good in the liberal democracy it's the only way to achieve anything and I'm more than willing to do it and I think conservatives should do it too I think conservatives ought to be less rationalistic and less ideological and less worried about if it works in theory who cares if it works in practice and they should deal in in realities and and I think we're seeing that bear out is President Trump doing things that we don't like yeah of course that budget was really awful it's really terrible why he hasn't defunded Planned Parenthood why the congressional Republicans have a defunded Planned Parenthood is beyond me but it's better than the alternative it's a lot better than the alternative a lot of good things are happening and you should keep that in mind and not let the perfect get in the way of the good next question from Sean Michael which left-wing media sources do you think are the least reliable in reporting the facts yes and I think that's my answer Washington Post is particularly awful these days it used to be fine or relatively fine but the Washington Post as you know is where democracy dies in darkness I'll single them out because the law is that they espouse are in the language that they use it's in the language itself so obviously the editorial staff picks ridiculous stories they only pick stories that will attack Trump they don't pick any stories that will support his narrative excuse me but the language they use they use the phrase not just illegal immigration which is a ridiculous phrase to be an immigrant you have to be accepted by a country you can be an immigrant or an illegal alien or a resident alien but they're not immigrants but they use it to conflate of legal immigrants from illegal aliens so they'll say immigration does this Trump is bad for immigrants Trump isn't bad for him against Trump is perfectly fine for people who immigrate to this country and observe our immigration laws he's a little harsh on criminals that's a different thing that's not an immigrant that's a criminal and so when you read them it's very hard unless you're very precise with your language very careful with language it's hard not to get sucked in by the because bad language gives away whole premises I'm doing a video for Prague review that's coming out soon on this very topic there s why I think they're particularly bad but they're all ridiculous it's worth reading them all to see what they're thinking and to get a different perspective and then you within about seven seconds I think can knock down that perspective and say it's completely ridiculous from Ryan come on Michael come on you're history of Protestantism is a bit slanted there were radical reformers of course Luther and the Vidhan burgers however never sought to leave the church Luther was excommunicated in xrj Domini in 1520 still ten years later Melancthon z' Augsburg confession made it clear that the desire that one a counts will be called to resolve their issues and two that it be done so all of us can accept and preserve a single true religion this too is argued because the Turks must be opposed by a unified Christendom see the preface to the Augsburg confession the Lutheran polity in turn was never formalized like the Calvinist polity that's because the Lutheran's allowed princes to function as emergency bishops and they only allow this to occur when Rome refused to give the German church's priests the breakaway churches priests Lutheran's were not iconoclasts like the Reformed Lutheran liturgical reforms were in fact quite conservative now I'm under no whitewash delusions about some of the flaws in Luther and some of the atrocities committed by Protestants later on some of his later writings in particular make Trump's rants sound tame but it's also wrong to characterize the Lutheran Reformation as radical if you're interested my dissertation examines the theology of the body and light of Luther's paradigmatic distinction alright I'll read that later I don't need to read that on the show check it out I absolutely will read it because I am I am very interested in these questions in this time period I am very hard on Luther Luther is radical because he cracked Christendom that's why I attacked Luther as being and because he sucked up to the Muslim invaders those are the reasons I'm hard on Luther I'm really not hard on Luther for his theology because his views were almost exactly the same as the Catholic views he believed in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist he believed in the Immaculate Conception of Mary he believed in the perpetual virginity of Mary he believed in the sacrum and for that matter This Is England Calvin also both believed in lots of these things the perpetual virginity of Mary virtually everybody believed in that from the first century through very very modern times they they accept that as clearly implied by Scripture so yeah I am a little harsh on Luther but you know there are some things that can be said for the guy that can't be said for his followers the real problem is that he cracked christened them this is that's what Hamlet's about and so that is a tough one to get over but all in all is better than a lot of other people what's worth pointing out here I think is that all heresies all breaks from the church it this occurred to me the other day they all seem to try to get rid of mystery mysteries that they can't really tolerate so these days a lot of a lot of breakaway churches or very modern churches they don't accept the perpetual virginity of Mary because it just is hard to make sense of they can't accept the Immaculate Conception early on in the church there was the Arian heresy that was the one that denied the divinity of Christ because they they couldn't understand how Christ is holy God and holy man that they can't resolve that mystery it's not a puzzle to be solved it's a mystery it's a holy mystery that tells us something about the faith and about God and about ourselves the albumen see and heresy which came later basically denied the body it said that only the Spirit was good and the body was utterly depraved and awful and evil and we have to reject it and be ascetic and because it couldn't resolve that we are spirits but we have a corrupted body it couldn't resolve the mystery of the unity of man so they had to reject that a lot of others have followed from him Islam takes similar issues they couldn't resolve have God is God and dies on a cross so they deny the cross Christ what they crucified him not is a line from the Quran and st. Paul writes about this he says and many are walking now and I tell you even weeping who deny the cross of Christ that a lot of modern people have issue with the sacraments they can't understand how the physical and the metaphysical touch if that mystery is too much and you can't resolve it it's a mystery it's not a puzzle to figure out it's a mystery that tells you about your faith I think this is what all heresy comes from and I'm not really accusing Luther of this Luther didn't have trouble really with with some of those mysteries other than the guy sitting on the throne in Rome he had trouble with that that mystery of authority but I think when we're considering questions of faith and religion if you if you find yourself trying to come up with an easy answer to mysteries of faith you're probably going the wrong way as dr. Johnson pointed out all shallows are clear from Craig hi Michael do we have time for we got time for like one or two more hi Michael I've been smoking a cigar for a few months and I hope not the same cigar may even probably smoking cigars generally as you say the body is a temple in the temple needs incense what cigars would you recommend that I can get in a local shop thanks Craig one I've been smoking lately that's very good is the dab it off ask Rio Grande perfecto it's overpriced but it's very delicious that has an Ecuador Habano wrapper Brazilian binder Brazilian and Dominican filler and it's rolled in the Dominican Republic that's a good one I smoked a really nice new cigar last week in New York at the cigar in can't remember the name now sorry but it's new it's one of these new boutiques that's come out and the Nat Sherman timeless is really good you can now get it other places and it's a excellent cigar if you want a grand reserve is very good I've been smoking a lot of tattoo I hate Cajon or 2006 excellent if you're just starting out if you're not totally into it yet and you want a good cigar on a budget believe a Vee is great my father nub Cain can't go wrong let's do one more I will get one more and we'll close it cut it for the day Bradley hi Michael you and Clavin are always talking about the culture and the conservatives generally do not do well on that political front or that cultural front rather my question is what can the average Joe do to help shift the culture toward conservatism particularly what can a 30-some year old cigar smoker history teacher do mmm interesting please don't tell me that I have to start watching Roseanne or the Kardashians ha ha love the show thanks Bret you're in the perfect place you are in the ideal place you don't have to watch the Kardashians you don't even have to watch Roseanne I kind of like Roseanne but you don't have to watch it you're in the perfect place because the culture is formed in those schools and you're teaching a highly the sized subject where the the left is succeeded in the culture because they invaded all of the schooling all of the universities and even younger and Hollywood and New York so you have the whole culture you are in a prime spot especially teaching history you should teach true history you should not be afraid to ignore people like Howard Zinn which mitch Daniels as head of Purdue and the governor of Indiana called his ridiculous revisionism exocrine you should teach true history you should teach that Christopher Columbus was a great man and a great devoted Explorer who founded our civilization you should teach that the founders and framers of the United States were great men wonderful men who formed the greatest freest most prosperous charitable country in the history of the world who were much smarter than we are today who are much better educated than we are today you should teach that you should teach the true history of science the history of science is totally ignored of people think that science just floats in in the air somewhere just popped up one day you should teach the religious underpinnings and the religious premises that are required by science and the profound piety and a Western culture of the people who founded science like Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton you should you should teach all of those things fearlessly because there is an awful movement of historicism and schools of resentment that want to hate our forebears that want to spit on the shoulders of giants but we shouldn't spit on the shoulders of giants we're not Giants ourselves we're Dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants maybe we can see a little further it's only because of those guys I would teach a grateful history in an accurate history and you'll be doing the Lord's work okay that's our show try to survive the weekend I know drew is not only not here but he's on the road the show try to survive in the meantime speaking of drew you can listen to another kingdom which is his a story that he wrote that I perform all the characters in you can get that wherever fine narrative podcasts are downloaded in the meantime I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show I will see you Monday the Michael Noel's show is a daily wire for word publishing production executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey supervising producer Mathis Glover our technical producer is Austin Stevens edited by Alex Zangaro audio is mixed by Mike Cora Mina herons makeup is by Joshua Avera copyright forward publishing 2018
