from me too - times up the 2018 edition of the Golden Globes was all about activism and social justice naturally this was a job for Superman I mean Oprah Winfrey yet well the media elites are fawning over Oprah stance why did her speech seem to ring so hollow so there was Oprah Winfrey or Queen Oprah as the New York Times likes to call her or future president Winfrey as NBC News likes to hailer anyway there was Oprah making her acceptance speech for the Cecil B DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award at the Golden Globes the other day predictably the New York Times hailed the Queen's commentary as the show's most electrifying speech not only was her speech the most electrifying but the time said Winfrey's words also received the most electrifying reaction wow that's a whole lot of voltage so it was that the mighty Winfrey's pithy speech was all about bringing an end to harassment and inequality and so on what I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have and I'm especially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories each of us in this room are celebrated because of the stories that we tell and this year we became the story yeah the woman of Hollywood became the story of 2017 all right Oprah herself said so and there was Meryl Streep in the crowd of beautiful people nodding her approval so it must be true sorry even in a town as phony-baloney as Hollywood seldom heavily witness such hypocritical crap uttered with a straight face I mean would it have been too much for Oprah to even utter the name Harvey Weinstein even at this late juncture well apparently so and then there were the star-studded trained seals in the crowd giving Oprah standing Oh on each supposedly profound statement made by the Queen without a crown but we now know full well that for decades Hollywood was rife with casting couch abuse and no one not even the mightiest a listeners dared to rock the boat indeed with all this talk about bravery and stepping forth and acting as agents of change where was Winfrey's platform of shows that could have and should have covered issues like sexual harassment in Hollywood instead there was merely radio silence in fact check out some of these pics of her Royal Highness from the not so good old days in which she's dining with Weinstein and hugging Weinstein and even kissing Weinstein did Oprah not know about ol Harve and his perverted ways we've been told over and over and over again that Weinstein's behavior was the biggest so-called open secret in Tinseltown it's hard to believe that such an open secret would never have made it onto Oprah's radar but keep in mind Harvey was no schlub he was a super producer well-loved by both the Hollywood and Democratic party elites and so it was that the stars deferred to a relatively unknown actress to do the heavy lifting when it came to exposing Frank and Weinstein hey what was the name of that Meryl Streep movie from a few years back oh yeah it's complicated but actually it's not complicated at all in the perversely liberal bias fear of the bizarre that is ever so progressive Hollywood it's now abundantly clear there was an unspoken code of conduct at play allow the powerful to abuse the aspiring and keep your mouth shut it's just business after all however sordid but you know what would have made Winfrey speech really brave and truly presidential it would have been if Oprah said words along the lines of this we as in most of us stars in this Golden Globe Studio allowed abuse to occur for decades without saying bugger-all for fear of being blacklisted and we should all be damned ashamed of ourselves for what we allowed to transpire now that's the sort of brutal honesty that could be hailed as the speech of a future president but no we didn't get anything like that from her and speaking of Oval Office aspirations Oprah's Golden Globe speech inexplicably appears to be a catalyst for a Winfrey and twenty20 campaign but isn't this yet more hypocrisy the Democrats have long condemned Trump as a populist as someone who's merely a reality TV star as someone who's never been elected for anything prior to running for president so then what is Oprah Winfrey but a reality TV star - I guess that argument is now just so 2016 and another thing why was so much of Oprah's speech about race what has engulfed Hollywood is a sex abuse scandal not a racism scandal why is it that the left always has to make everything about race even when it isn't about race let's be honest here it was only when it became abundantly clear that Weinstein's career was irredeemable that the likes of big-name celebrities jumped aboard that wild and woolly toboggan ride otherwise known as he'll never have lunch in this town again so it is that speaking out against abuses actually emerged as the in thing to do in Tinseltown and so it is that Oprah sweeps in slaps on a do-rag or black designer dress costing about as much as the average family sedan and rails about injustice albeit in a frustratingly cryptic fashion give me a break already that speech was no act of bravery that speech was not presidential it was a bunch of vapin and vacuous nuggets linked together to help empower a bunch of liberal hypocrites to feel a little bit better about themselves and their own industries culture of systemic abuse accompanied by deafening silence for the rebel dawn media I'm David the men's ID Menzies like what you just saw then please consider becoming a premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
