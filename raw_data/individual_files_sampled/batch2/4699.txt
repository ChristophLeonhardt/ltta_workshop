so when did you get into as you said the racial stuff when the Trayvon Martin case happened you know the Michael Brown and Tamir rice and all these different things happen every single case it's some little black behaving like a savage and he gets himself in trouble shockingly enough I'm here to spread ideas talk in the hopes that somebody more capable will come along and do that somebody like Donald Trump who does not give his daughter to a jewel so Donald Trump Italy Maurice a lot more racist than Donald Trump though is a report from vice news tonight on HBO and it featured a conversation with white nationalist Chris Cantwell before last year's deadly unite the right rally in Charlottesville Virginia and a new special examining the aftermath correspondent le rêve interviews Cantwell again about the current state of the alt-right movement do you think the GOP is adopting any of the all rights ideas not explicitly it might be it might be influencing it though we're influencing culture and culture influences politics yeah I mean I guess it's why I feel like you're saying it both ways like oh what I'm trying to here's the difficulty of it okay you're trying to tie the Republican Party to the alt-right because you think that'll be politically advantageous for you and I think it's a disgusting tactic and I'm trying not to help you the fact of the matter is the more the left goes insane and makes and drives up hyper awareness of the racial tensions more and more people come to us and that's a very good thing and that is going to start influencing politics if it hasn't already and le rêve joins us now le thanks for being with us obviously Charlottesville was a black stain on on American culture last year on American politics we're just curious we were talking about the dud of a rally yesterday but how did Charlottesville change America over the past year and how did it change the alt-right movement well it put a tremendous amount of pressure on the outright both from journalists and from activists so anyone who showed their face at that rally had their name put out there local newspapers picked it up and then they got fired the leaders of this movement were not prepared for the pressure that anti-fascist activists would put on them so Richard Spencer has quit his college tour and moved away from DC another leader was exposed by the New York Times as being a fake Iraq veteran a third leader was arrested in a domestic violence incident after according to police he was caught having an affair with his stepfather and law's wife so he has quit the movement so the leaders can't organize either because they can't talk securely online anti-fascist infiltrate their communications networks and because they can't raise money because crowdfunding sites payment processors all refuse to allow them to use their services so Eddie Glen so let me ask you this question it's easy for us to kind of condemn the obvious villains of Charlottesville the white nationalists and the like but what can we learn from Charlottesville about us not the obvious villains because the villains are part of melodrama right where we despite I write about I wrote about this in Politico where we displace our sins onto their shoulders but how one year later what kind of mirror the Charlotte ville present to us as a nation in your view well I think what these white power activists understand is that many people who don't think of themselves as racist still have unconscious biases and they've learned how to play upon those biases to bring people closer to their side so you see them talk about black lives matter a lot yeah and and that's really important because you're not talking about you know some imaginary remote rural southerner right you're talking about people in the cities people where wealthy people of people where places where liberals live right that that strikes at the heart of liberal power and and that is a much more powerful appeal to like mainstream people yeah Casey hunts with us and has a question Casey hey Ali the one thing that has been sort of observed in the wake of Charlottesville at Politico did a long story about how there was tremendous backlash to the events obviously but also to the president and how he handled the events at that time there were business CEOs who walked away who said that they weren't gonna associate with the president any longer but over the course of the last year the president has continued to make racially tinged remarks to put it mildly and sort of one by one the quietly a lot of those thought and opinion and business leaders have found their way back to engaging with the president he had many of them over to dinner in Bedminster just last week over the weekend I is there in your view kind of a material difference one year later has has have we as a country grappled with this and refused to forget it or has it kind of drifted away I think most people don't forget it most people still see this as an evil that we don't want to infect our culture but white nationalists call talk about something that I call shifting the Overton Window which means they want to shift the parameters of the political debate so that what was once forbidden becomes fringe and what was fringe becomes mainstream and so they see themselves like pulling their once totally forbidden ideas to be a little bit more fringe you know so so Donald Trump will condemn all racism you know and and the idea there is that he's also condemning racism against white people wherever that might be let me ask you a very very straightforward very pointed question right so we you were there last before the the horror and charlottesville last year you're now back you talked to these people who were members of the white nationalist movements neo-nazi movements do they believe Donald Trump has their back a year later yeah yes I mean Chris Cantwell he was getting very angry at me for trying to see ask him about were there any links between the alt-right and the Republican Party he starts yelling at me right the entire time he's got his own flag of Don face right behind a leaning over his shoulder they they like Donald Trump not just for the racial politics but also for the attitude the idea that he doesn't mind making people angry another catchphrase among them was womp womp after Corey Lewandowski used that phrase to refer to children being separated from their parents at the border and Donald Trump gets positive tweets adding from of course none other than David Duke it's it's really eye-opening and vice news tonight on HBO is going to be airing Monday through Thursday at 7:30 p.m. make sure you catch it le rêve thank you so much for being with us we
