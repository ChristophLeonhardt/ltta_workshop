00:00:03,074 --> 00:00:06,811
AT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT.

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:08,914
>> MELISSA: WE HAVE ENGLISH NOW.

4
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:14,920
>> YOU CAN LISTEN TO IRAN

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,655
SUPREME LEADER.

6
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:20,325
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC IS NEVER

7
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:22,594
BEEN AFTER NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

8
00:00:22,594 --> 00:00:26,831
>> YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE IRANIAN

9
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:28,366
PRESIDENT ROUHANI.

10
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:30,302
NNUCLEAR WEAPONS AND OTHER

11
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:32,604
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION HAS

12
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:35,607
NO PLACE IN IRAN'S SECURITY AND

13
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:41,379
DEFENSE DOCTRINE AND CONTRADICT

14
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:42,981
OUR CONVICTIONS.

15
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:45,784
>> THIS IS FROM THE IRANIAN

16
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:47,819
FOREIGN MINISTER.

17
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:50,188
>> WE CONSIDER NUCLEAR WEAPONS

18
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:52,924
IRRATIONAL AND IMMORAL.

19
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:54,926
>> WELL, TONIGHT I AM HERE TO

20
00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:57,829
TELL YOU ONE THING.

21
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:59,698
IRAN LIED.

22
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:00,298
BIG TIME.

23
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:03,034
AFTER SIGNING THE NUCLEAR DEAL

24
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:07,072
IN 2015, IRAN INTENSIFIED ITS

25
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,307
EFFORTS TO HIDE THE SECRET

26
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:10,775
NUCLEAR FILES.

27
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:14,813
IN 2017, IRAN MOVED ITS NUCLEAR

28
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:18,950
WEAPON'S FILED TO A HIGHLY

29
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,721
SECRET DISTRICT IN SOUTHERN

30
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:23,088
TEHERAN.

31
00:01:23,088 --> 00:01:26,358
THIS IS WHERE THEY KEPT THE

32
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:28,660
ATOMIC ARCHIVES RIGHT HERE.

33
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,896
FEW IRANIANS KNEW WHERE IT WAS.

34
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:32,664
VERY FEW.

35
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:36,501
AND ALSO FEW ISRAELIS.

36
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:39,371
NOW FROM THE OUTSIDE, THIS WAS

37
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:40,672
AN INNOCENT LOOKINGLY COMPOUND

38
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:44,209
AND LOOKS LIKE A DILAPIDATED

39
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:44,609
WAREHOUSE.

40
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,946
BUT FROM THE INSIDE IT CONTAINED

41
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:52,584
THE IRANIAN ATOMIC ARCHIVES AND

42
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:54,486
LOOK BIGGER THAN THIS.

43
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:57,155
AND IN A GREAT INTELLIGENCE

44
00:01:57,155 --> 00:01:59,557
ACHIEVEMENT A FEW WEEKS AGO,

45
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:02,694
ISRAEL OBTAINED HALF A TON OF

46
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:04,796
THE MATERIAL INSIDE OF THESE

47
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:16,641
VAULT AND THIS IS WHAT WE GOT.

48
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:20,412
55000 PAGES, ANOTHER 55000 FILES

49
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:24,249
ON 183 CD'S.

50
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:27,018
EVERYTHING YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE,

51
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:32,490
IS AN EXACT COPY OF THE ORIGINAL

52
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,091
IRANIAN MATERIAL.

53
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:36,461
YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW WHERE ARE

54
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:37,495
THE ORIGINALS?

55
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:39,798
THEY ARE NOW IN A VERY SAFE

56
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:40,131
PLACE.

57
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:43,601
THIS IS WHAT THE FILES INCLUDED.

58
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:45,770
INCRIMINATING DOCUMENTS,

59
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,041
INCRIMINATING CHARTS.

60
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,176
INCRIMINATING PRESENTATION AND

61
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:56,014
BLUE PRINTING.

62
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:58,917
INCRIMINATING VIDEOS.

63
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:00,552
AND MORE.

64
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:04,389
WE'VE SHARED THIS MATERIAL WITH

65
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:05,290
THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED

66
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,128
STATES CAN VOUCH FOR ITS

67
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:10,562
AUTHTENSITY.

68
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:12,097
AND WE'LL SHARE IT WITH THE

69
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:15,266
OTHER COUNTRIES THE ATOMIC

70
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:15,900
INTERNATIONAL AGENCY.

71
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,635
WE'LL TELL YOU THE HISTORY OF

72
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:18,336
THE MATERIAL.

73
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:20,805
WE HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT

74
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:23,842
IRAN HAD A SECRET NUCLEAR

75
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:28,346
PROGRAM CALLED PROJECT AMAD.

76
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:29,581
WE CAN PROVE IT WAS

77
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:32,684
A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO

78
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:35,720
DESIGN, BUILD AND TEST NUCLEAR

79
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,121
WEAPONS.

80
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:39,891
WE CAN ALSO PROVE THAT IRAN IS

81
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:43,128
SECRETLY STORING PROJECT AMAD

82
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:45,997
MATERIAL TO USE AT A TIME OF ITS

83
00:03:45,997 --> 00:03:47,799
CHOICE TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR

84
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:48,299
WEAPONS.

85
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,570
THIS IS WHAT PROJECT AMAD'S

86
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,239
SPECIFIC GOAL WAS CREATING

87
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,407
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

88
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:58,743
THIS IS AN ORIGINAL IRANIAN

89
00:03:58,743 --> 00:03:59,878
PRESENTATION FROM THE FILE AND

90
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:02,447
THIS IS THE MISSION STATEMENT.

91
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:09,721
DESIGN, PRODUCE AND TEST FIVE

92
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:10,488
WARHEADS, EACH WITH TEN KILOTON

93
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:11,723
TNT YIELD FOR INTEGRATION ON

94
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:13,091
A MISSILE.

95
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:21,933
YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ PH ARSEE

96
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:24,102
TO READ THIS HERE.

97
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:29,507
THIS IS SPECIFIC GOAL OF PROJECT

98
00:04:29,507 --> 00:04:29,841
AMAD.

99
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:33,077
THAT IS LIKE FIVE HIRO SHIMMA

100
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:34,812
BOMBS ON THE MISSILES.

101
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:40,285
THIS IS AN ORIGINAL IRANIAN

102
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:41,686
SPREADSHEET.

103
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:45,690
YELLOW CAKE.

104
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:52,230
AND CENTERFUDGE AND TEST.

105
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,734
AND WHEN WE ANALYZED WHAT IS IN

106
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:59,003
THE ARCHIVES.

107
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:01,606
PROJECT AMAD HAD FIVE KEY

108
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:03,875
ELEMENTS OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON'S

109
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:04,242
PROGRAM.

110
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:06,978
I WILL TAKE THEM ONE BY ONE.

111
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:08,379
FIRST ELEMENT IS DESIGNING

112
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:09,981
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

113
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:13,117
THIS IS AN ORIGINAL IRANIAN

114
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:14,919
ILLUSTRATION OF A WEAPON.

115
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:23,294
AGAIN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ PH

116
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:24,929
ARSI TO UNDERSTAND.

117
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:28,233
THAT IS ENRICHED URANIUM.

118
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,602
THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE YOU FIND

119
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:33,638
IN THE CORE ENRICHED URANIUM.

120
00:05:33,638 --> 00:05:35,873
AND THAT IS PUTTING ALL OF THE

121
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:36,774
COMPONENTS TOGETHER.

122
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:40,044
THAT'S THE FIRST COMPONENT.

123
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:41,512
SECOND COMPONENT, DEVELOPING

124
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:42,547
NUCLEAR CORES.

125
00:05:42,547 --> 00:05:47,018
THIS IS A PHOTOSHOWING THE

126
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:49,220
CASTING PROCESS AND A CAST METAL

127
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,459
CORE FROM THE ARCHIVES AND HERE

128
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,861
IS A SECRET UNDERGROUND

129
00:05:56,861 --> 00:06:00,465
FACILITIES THE IRANIANS ARE

130
00:06:00,465 --> 00:06:02,867
BUILDING TO PRODUCE THE NUCLEAR

131
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:03,368
CORES.

132
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:05,970
WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF DOCUMENTS.

133
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,140
THIRD COMPONENT.

134
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,242
BUILDING SYSTEMS OF A MEASURING

135
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:12,777
DEVICE FOR IMPLOSIONS.

136
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:16,514
AND THIS IS A SIMULATION OF

137
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:20,718
A NUCLEAR IMPLOSION.

138
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:22,086
FOURTH ELEMENT.

139
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:23,988
PREPARING NUCLEAR TEST.

140
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:29,193
THIS IS A MAP OF FIVE POTENTIAL

141
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:32,196
AREAS FOR NUCLEAR TEST IN

142
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:35,033
EASTERN IRAN.

143
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:39,170
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

144
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:40,605
AND FIFTH.

145
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:42,674
INTEGRATING NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON

146
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:45,176
MISSILES AND THIS IS A DESIGN

147
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:50,448
FOR A NUCLEAR PAY LOAD FROM THE

148
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:51,749
ARCHIVE.

149
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:52,884
HERE IS THE WAR HEAD.

150
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:57,488
AND HERE IS THE BOMB.

151
00:06:57,488 --> 00:07:00,091
AND I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU

152
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:03,494
THAT IRAN IS EXPANDING THE RANGE

153
00:07:03,494 --> 00:07:06,230
OF BALLISTIC NUCLEAR CAPABLE

154
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,565
MISSILES STARTING WITH

155
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:14,405
A THOUSAND KILOMBETERS AND NOW

156
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:16,040
RYAD.

157
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,143
TEL AVIV, MOSCOW, BUT THEY ARE

158
00:07:19,143 --> 00:07:21,612
WORKING ON FAR, FAR GREATER

159
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:22,146
RANGES.

160
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:25,750
THEY ARE PLANNING MUCH LONGER

161
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,720
RANGE MISSILES TO CARRY NUCLEAR

162
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,253
WEAPONS.

163
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:32,657
SO THESE FILES CONCLUSIVELY

164
00:07:32,657 --> 00:07:36,094
PROVE THAT IRAN IS IT BRAZENLY

165
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:38,596
LYING WHEN IT SAID IT NEVER HAD

166
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:43,668
A NUCLEAR WEAPON'S PROGRAM.

167
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:45,336
THE FILES PROVE THAT.

168
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:48,272
AND HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

169
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:50,375
IRAN WAS FACED WITH MOUNTING

170
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,745
PRESSURE IN 2003 FOLLOWING THE

171
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:56,247
GULF WAR AND IT WAS FORCED TO

172
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:58,683
SHELVE PROJECT AMAD BUT NOT THE

173
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:00,685
NUCLEAR AMBITIONS.

174
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:03,821
AND SO IRAN DEVISED A PLAN TO DO

175
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:05,223
TWO THINGS.

176
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:08,426
PRESERVE THE NUCLEAR KNOW HOW

177
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:11,295
FROM PROJECTA MAD.

178
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:14,499
AND NUCLEAR WEAPON'S

179
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:15,466
CAPABILITYINGLY THAT CAME FROM

180
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:17,769
THE TOP LEADERSHIP OF IRAN.

181
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,103
THIS IS ANOTHER DOCUMENT FROM

182
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:20,071
THE ARCHIVE.

183
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:22,740
THIS IS FOLLOWING THE NEW

184
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,109
DIRECTIVE OF THE IRAN'S MINISTER

185
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:28,012
OF DEFENSE, TODAY HE IS DIRECTOR

186
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:29,080
OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

187
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,249
AND FOLLOWING THE NEW DIRECTIVE

188
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:35,186
OF IRAN'S MINISTER OF DEFENSE,

189
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:38,389
THE WORK WOULD BE SPLIT INTO TWO

190
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,323
PARTS:  COVERT AND OVERT.

191
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:42,794
A KEY PART OF THE PLAN WAS TO

192
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:44,295
FORM NEW ORGANIZATIONS TO

193
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:47,432
CONTINUE THE WORK.

194
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:52,270
THIS IS HOW DR. HEAD OF PUT IT.

195
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,138
REMEMBER THAT NAME.

196
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:57,241
HERE IS HIS DIRECTOR.

197
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,843
THE GENERAL AIM IS TO ANNOUNCE

198
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:02,246
THE CLOSURE OF PROJECT AMAD.

199
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:04,816
BUT SPECIAL ACTIVITIES, YOU KNOW

200
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:06,617
WHAT THAT IS, SPECIAL ACTIVITIES

201
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:08,653
WILL BE CARRIED OUT UNDER THE

202
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:12,623
TITLE OF SCIENTIFIC KNOW HOW

203
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:13,057
DEVELOPMENT.

204
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:17,061
AND IN FACT, THIS IS EXACTLY

205
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:19,397
WHAT IRAN PROCEEDED TO DO.

206
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:21,032
IT HAS CONTINUED THE WORK IN

207
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:23,568
A SERIES OF ORGANIZATIONS OVER

208
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:28,806
THE YEARS, AND TODAY IN 2010 AND

209
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:33,311
2018 THIS WORK IS CARRIED OUT BY

210
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:33,644
SUPON.

211
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:35,346
THAT IS AN ORGANIZATION INSIDE

212
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:36,714
OF THE IRANIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY

213
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:41,752
AND YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO

214
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:45,890
LEARN IT IS LED BY THE SAME

215
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:54,765
DOCTOR FAK I

216
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:54,799
DOCTOR FAK IRI

217
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:54,832
DOCTOR FAK IRIZA

218
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:55,433
DOCTOR FAK IRIZA D

219
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:55,466
DOCTOR FAK IRIZA D EH

220
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:56,133
DOCTOR FAK IRIZA D EH.

221
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:58,936
IRAN PLANNED IN THE HIGHEST

222
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:00,771
LEVELS TO CONTINUE WORK RELATED

223
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:04,942
TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS UNDER THE

224
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:06,811
DIFFERENT GUISES AND USE THE

225
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,412
SAME PERSONNEL.

226
00:10:08,412 --> 00:10:10,515
I WANT TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER

227
00:10:10,515 --> 00:10:12,717
EXAMPLE OF IRAN'S NUCLEAR

228
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:15,720
WEAPON'S RELATED ACTIVITIES THAT

229
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,992
CONTINUED AFTER PROJECT AMAD.

230
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:24,962
YOU REMEMBER THE FORDO FACILITY?

231
00:10:24,962 --> 00:10:28,199
IT WAS A SECRET ENRICHMENT

232
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:30,635
FACILITY UNDERGROUND THAT THE

233
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:32,670
IRANIANS BUILT UNDER A MOUNTAIN.

234
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,008
YOU DON'T PUT THOUSANDS OF

235
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:40,144
CENTRIFUGES UNDER A MOUNTAIN TO

236
00:10:40,144 --> 00:10:42,547
PRODUCE MEDICAL IOTONIGHTS.

237
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:44,582
YOU PUT THEM ONE REASON.

238
00:10:44,582 --> 00:10:49,086
ENRICHMENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

239
00:10:49,086 --> 00:10:52,523
BUT FORDOW WAS DESIGNED FOR

240
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:54,792
NUCLEAR PROSPECTS AS PROJECT

241
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:55,126
AMAD.

242
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:59,196
THIS IS AN ORIGINAL IRANIAN BLUE

243
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:04,168
PRINT MUCH FORDOW AND IRAN

244
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:06,938
CONTINUED TO BUILD YEARS AFTER

245
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:08,873
PROJECT AMADDENEDED AND THIS IS

246
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:10,508
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

247
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:14,679
THAT'S THE ENTRANCE AND IT GOES

248
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,681
UNDER A MOUNTAIN.

249
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:20,451
YOU WILL ALSO NOT BE SURPRISED

250
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:24,055
IRAN INSISTED ON KEEPING FORDOW

251
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:27,091
AND AMAZINGLY THE NUCLEAR DEAL

252
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:29,160
ENABLED THEM TO DO IT.

253
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,128
BUT THIS CAME WITH A HITCH.

254
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:34,498
IRAN WAS REQUIRED BY THE IEA TO

255
00:11:34,498 --> 00:11:37,234
COME CLEAN BY THE NUCLEAR DEAL,

256
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:39,503
TO COME CLEAN TO THE

257
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:43,507
INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY

258
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:46,677
AGENCY ABOUT THE NUCLEAR

259
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:47,078
PROGRAM.

260
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:48,713
THIS WAS A CONDITION FOR

261
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:50,848
IMPLEMENTING THE NUCLEAR DEAL.

262
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:54,952
IRAN HAS TO COME CLEAN.

263
00:11:54,952 --> 00:12:02,326
SUE ON DECEMBER 2015 IA EA

264
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:04,395
PUBLISHED THE NUCLEAR ASPECT.

265
00:12:04,395 --> 00:12:06,097
THIS IS THE REPORT.

266
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:09,567
THIS WAS IRAN'S CHANCE TO FULLY

267
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,035
AND THEY COULD TELL THE TRUTH

268
00:12:11,035 --> 00:12:13,571
AND WE HAVE A SECRET PROGRAM AND

269
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:17,375
IT IS OVER AND WE SHELVED IT AND

270
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,077
IT DOESN'T EXIST AND WE DESTROY

271
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:20,745
IT DOESN'T EXIST AND WE DESTRO

272
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:26,384
DESTROYED THE MATERIAL.

273
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:28,552
IRAN SAID IRAN DENIED THE

274
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:31,555
EXISTENCE OF A COORDINATED

275
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:35,626
PROGRAM AIMED A SPECIFIC NUCLEAR

276
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:38,295
DEVICE AND DENIED THE EXISTENCE

277
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:42,433
OF THE AMAD PLAN.

278
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:45,369
AND THE MATERIAL PROVES

279
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:45,770
OTHERWISE.

280
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,039
THAT IRAN AUTHORIZED AND

281
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:50,474
INITIATED AND FUNDED PROJECT

282
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:50,808
AMAD.

283
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:52,977
AND AIMED AT A DEVELOPMENT OF

284
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:55,279
A NUCLEAR DEVICE AND THIS IS

285
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,681
ANOTHER DOCUMENT FROM THE

286
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:58,749
ARCHIVES AND IT WAS A MASTER

287
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:02,920
PLAN OF PROJECT AMAD.

288
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,857
IRAN SAID TO THE IAEA, NO WORK

289
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:12,797
WAS CONDUCTED WITH MULTIPOINT

290
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:13,230
INITIATION.

291
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,565
THIS SCIENTIFIC TERMINOLOGY IS

292
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:16,367
SOMETHING THAT IS NECESSARY TO

293
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:17,334
UNDERSTAND THE PRODUCTION OF

294
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:18,302
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

295
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:20,137
THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY.

296
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:23,607
NO WORK HAS BEEN CONDUCTED WITH

297
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:30,114
MPI TECHNOLOGY IN HEM FEARICAL

298
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:30,614
GEOMETRY.

299
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:32,850
THIS IS IT A FABRICATION.

300
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,953
IRAN CONDUCTED EXTENSE ITCH WORK

301
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:37,588
WITH MPI.

302
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:39,123
HUNDREDS OF DOCUMENTS PROVE.

303
00:13:39,123 --> 00:13:42,293
IT AND IRAN SAID TO THE AGENCY,

304
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:47,131
THAT IT HAD NOT EXPECTED WORKS

305
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:50,634
DESIGNED FOR A NUCLEAR DEVICE.

306
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:52,737
BUT THE FILES AGAIN SHOW IT IS

307
00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:56,674
IT A LIE.

308
00:13:56,674 --> 00:13:59,410
IRAN CONDUCTED METALLURGICAL

309
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,878
WORK FOR A NUCLEAR DEVICE.

310
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:04,515
THERE IS PLENTY MORE IN THE

311
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:04,915
ARCHIVES.

312
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:06,917
AND SO WHAT I HAVE SHOWN YOU

313
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:09,487
TONIGHT IS A FRACTIONS OF THE

314
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:12,623
TOTAL MATERIAL THAT WE HAVE.

315
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:16,527
BUT EVEN FROM THIS SAMPLE YOU

316
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:20,397
CAN DRAW FOUR MAIN CONCLUSIONS.

317
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:22,099
FIRST IRAN LIED ABOUT NEVER

318
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:25,136
HAVING A NUCLEAR WEAPON

319
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:26,237
'PROGRAM.

320
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:28,239
100,000 SECRET FILES PROVED THAT

321
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,240
THEY LIED.

322
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,376
AND SECOND, EVEN AFTER THE DEAL,

323
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:34,678
IRAN CONTINUED TO PRESERVE AND

324
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:37,348
EXPAND THE NUCLEAR WEAPON'S KNOW

325
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:40,151
HOW FOR FUTURE NUCLEAR WORSE.

326
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:42,820
WHY WOULD A TERRORIST REYEEM

327
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,857
HIDE AND METICULOUSLY CATALOG

328
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:49,260
THE SECRET NUCLEAR FILES IF NOT

329
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,229
TO USE THEM AT A LATER DATE?

330
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:55,232
THIRD, IRAN LIED AGAIN IN 2015

331
00:14:55,232 --> 00:15:00,204
WHEN IT DIDN'T COME CLEAN TO THE

332
00:15:00,204 --> 00:15:01,906
IAEAN ON THE NUCLEAR DEAL?

333
00:15:01,906 --> 00:00:00,000
AND FINALLY, THE IRAN DEAL, THE
