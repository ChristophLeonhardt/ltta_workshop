president Trump's budget has finally been released overall I'm actually pretty pleased with it much like president Trump's campaign and presidency thus far the overall theme is America first for instance it abolished quite a few programs that shouldn't have been around to begin with like the mcgovern-dole international food for education fund but that donated agricultural commodities and financial assistance to feeding programs in foreign countries now look I am NOT heartless but I just think that we should take care of our homeless and hungry veterans first sorry I also slashed entitlements and favor the military instead something President Trump has been talking about all along entitlement reform which is obviously a much more extensive process but cutting some of these programs out of the budget well that's a darn good start so it will reduce those entitlement programs by 1.7 trillion dollars over the next decade and the non-defense discretionary budget by two percent annually the budget also proposes to terminate federal funding for PBS and NPR which would drive my liberal stick of fant progressive talk radio pals absolutely mad which is literally worth about two hundred billion dollars to me also the new infrastructure plan accounts for about two hundred billion dollars of it which means jobs jobs jobs and thirteen billion dollars worth of new spending to fight the opioid epidemic and will cut spending on Medicare by two hundred and thirty seven billion dollars and it estimates to cut the 20 point six trillion dollar deficit by three trillion dollars over the next decade it increases defense spending to 716 billion dollars as well as a two point six percent raise for troops and the best part will be legen wait for it wait for it dary of course eighteen billion dollars over the next two fiscal years for that beautiful border wall finally thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at w ww media /oz make sure you're following us on Facebook and Twitter as well for all the latest news thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel you
