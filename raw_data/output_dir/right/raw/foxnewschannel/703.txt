1
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:10,487
AINSLEY: A STORY NO ONE IS

2
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:11,288
TELLING YOU ABOUT HAPPENING

3
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,125
ARE REALLY UP AGAINST ON A

4
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:15,559
DAILY BASIS.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,261
>> AS I HAVE ALWAYS TOLD

6
00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:17,961
PEOPLE, BORDER SECURITY IS

7
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:20,130
NATIONAL SECURITY.

8
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:21,532
OUR PEOPLE STARTED CHANGING

9
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:21,865
DIAPERS.

10
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:25,169
THEM.

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,537
I MEAN, THINGS THAT WE

12
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:27,771
NORMALLY DON'T EXPECT OF OUR

13
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:28,672
LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE TO

14
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:33,777
DO, THAT'S WHAT OUR AGENTS

15
00:00:33,778 --> 00:00:34,278
DO.

16
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:36,947
STEVE: EACH AND EVERY DAY.

17
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:41,418
SHE JOINS US FROM L.A.

18
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:42,786
YOU WATCH A LOT OF THE

19
00:00:42,787 --> 00:00:44,154
CHANNELS AND THESE GUYS WHO

20
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:45,656
PATROL OUR BORDER ARE MADE

21
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:47,157
OUT TO BE MONSTERS.

22
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:48,192
BUT PEOPLE.

23
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:49,827
WHEN THEY SEE A BABY, THEY

24
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:51,662
TRY TO HELP THE BABY.

25
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:54,264
AS THAT GUY JUST SAID.

26
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:54,631
>> YEAH.

27
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:56,300
FIRST AND FOREMOST, THEY ARE

28
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:56,733
HUMANITARIANS.

29
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:57,768
AND, OF COURSE, THEIR JOB

30
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:58,936
AND DUTY IS TO PROTECT OUR

31
00:00:58,937 --> 00:00:59,269
BORDER.

32
00:01:07,212 --> 00:01:08,946
COME HERE ILLEGALLY THAT WAS

33
00:01:08,947 --> 00:01:09,980
THE MOST WONDERFUL THING I

34
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:10,914
DISCOVERED ON MY TRIP TO THE

35
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:11,949
BORDER THAT THESE AGENTS

36
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,350
EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE

37
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,586
THAT I MET CARED ABOUT

38
00:01:15,587 --> 00:01:17,287
PEOPLE FIRST, ABOVE ANYTHING

39
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:18,989
ELSE, THAT WAS THEIR

40
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,356
PRIORITY.

41
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:20,657
AND, IN MANY CASES, THESE

42
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:26,597
-D

43
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:27,798
--FAMILIES AND CHILDREN ARE

44
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,266
THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS

45
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:29,666
THEMSELVES.

46
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:30,300
THEY ARE OUT THERE MAKING

47
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:31,468
SURE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE

48
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:35,472
TO THEIR FAMILIES.

49
00:01:35,473 --> 00:01:36,640
OUR BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE

50
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:45,916
INTERVIEW NOW?

51
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:51,655
>> LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

52
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:57,427
IF WE DO NOT APPLY CONS -- THIS

53
00:01:57,428 --> 00:01:58,529
BORDER IS A VERY DANGEROUS

54
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:58,829
PLACE.

55
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,464
I HEARD THE COMMENT PEOPLE

56
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:01,131
OUTRAGED WHAT THIS

57
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:01,899
ADMINISTRATION AND WHAT WE

58
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,734
ARE DOING IN PARTICULAR.

59
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:05,135
BUT WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE FOR

60
00:02:05,136 --> 00:02:06,537
THE PUBLIC AGAINST SOME OF

61
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:08,105
THESE PARENTS WHO ARE TAKING

62
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:12,676
THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH THE

63
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:15,445
DESSERT IN EXTREME HEAT,

64
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:16,413
VERY VIOLENT AREAS AND

65
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:18,348
PLACING THEM IN THE HANDS OF

66
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:19,483
SMUGGLERS, THAT'S WHERE THE

67
00:02:19,484 --> 00:02:23,220
OUTRAGE NEEDS TO BE.

68
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:26,857
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND MOMS

69
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:28,559
BRINGING THEIR BABIES OVER.

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,859
DRUGS?

71
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,693
DID YOU SEE ANY OF THAT?

72
00:02:29,694 --> 00:02:30,794
>> REALLY A COMBINATION OF

73
00:02:30,795 --> 00:02:32,129
ALL THOSE THINGS.

74
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,597
PARTICULARLY WHERE I WAS IN

75
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:37,668
COURSE, THEY DEAL WITH IT

76
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:38,936
EACH AND EVERY SINGLE DAY

77
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:40,737
THEY ARE SEEING DRUG

78
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:41,572
SMUGGLERS AND COYOTES,

79
00:02:41,573 --> 00:02:42,706
THAT'S THEIR BIGGEST FEAR

80
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:43,440
THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE

81
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:45,142
BEING PLACED IN THE HANDS OF

82
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:46,910
A TRAFFICKERS AND THE DRUG

83
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:47,277
SMUGGLERS.

84
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:48,645
SO, WHAT THEY TOLD ME WAS

85
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:52,983
THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

86
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:54,985
AND THE DEHUMANIZATION AND

87
00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:56,153
VILIFICATION OF OUR BORDER

88
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:58,288
PATROL AGENTS FOR FAMILY

89
00:02:58,289 --> 00:02:58,689
SEPARATION.

90
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,990
MANY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND

91
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:01,158
A LOT OF TIMES THESE AGENTS

92
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,892
ARE SEPARATING FAMILIES

93
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:06,463
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT TRUE

94
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:09,700
FAMILY UNITS MANY TIMES THEY

95
00:03:12,937 --> 00:03:14,371
LIKE THE HUMANITARIANS THAT

96
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:16,473
THEY ARE.

97
00:03:16,474 --> 00:03:17,908
NOT ONLY STOPPING CRIME BUT

98
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:21,211
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE SAFE

99
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:22,946
AND TAKEN CARE OF.

100
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,284
MAINSTREAM MEDIA NETWORKS.

101
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:27,851
STEVE: YOU ARE RIGHT.

102
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:29,353
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT ANGLE

103
00:03:29,354 --> 00:03:31,722
