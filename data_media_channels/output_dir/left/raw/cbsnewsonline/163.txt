HAS BEEN VERY GOOD, AND THAT IS 

27
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,286

WELL OVER THE LAST YEAR, AND I 

37
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,010
AM REALLY AT A POINT WHERE WE 

38
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,314
ARE HAVING A CLOSE TIME TO HAVE 

39
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,216
THE CABINET THAT I WANT COBB 

40
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,383
BUT I THINK MIKE POMPEO WILL BE 

41
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:26,519
A TRULY GREAT SECRETARY OF 

42
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,821
STATE, I HAVE TOTAL CONFIDENCE 

43
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:30,990
IN HIM, AND AS FAR AS REX 

44
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,526
TILLERSON IS CONCERNED, I VERY 

45
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,160
MUCH APPRECIATE HIS COMMITMENT 

46
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,531
AND HIS SERVICE, AND I WISH HIM

00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,434
WELL.>> EARLIER, I SPOKE TO THE 

48
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,538
HILL, BOB CUSACK.>> IS SIMILAR 

49
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,441
TO HOW JAMES COMEY WAS FIRED, 

50
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,842
TRUMP DID NOT CONTACT JAMES 

51
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:52,445
COMEY, HE HAD AN ASSISTANT GO 

52
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,147
OVER TO THE FBI, AND COMAY WAS 

53
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,282
OUT OF TOWN, AND THERE WAS A 

54
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,084
LOT OF -- JAMES COMEY WAS OUT 

55
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:58,618
OF TOWN. 

56
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,387
THERE WAS A LOT OF TENSION 

57
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,589
BETWEEN REX TILLERSON AND 

58
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,089
DONALD TRUMP, I THINK HE WAS 

59
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:08,294
NEVER ABLE TO GET OVER THE FACT 

60
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,095
THAT IT WAS REPORTED THAT 

61
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,029
TILLERSON CALLED HIM A MORON, 

62
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:10,829
THEY DIDN'T TRUST EACH OTHER, 

63
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:11,698
GOING INTO THESE NORTH KOREA 

64
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:15,301
TALKS, HE LIKES LOYALISTS, MIKE 

65
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,703
POMPEO IS A LOYALIST, REX 

66
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:17,904
TILLERSON IS NOT.

67
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:22,208
>> TELL ME ABOUT MIKE POMPEO 

68
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,176
AND NORTH KOREA, WHAT DO WE 

69
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,444
KNOW ABOUT HIS RECORD? 

70
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:29,549
>> VERY ACCOMPLISHED, IN THE 

71
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,149
HOUSE, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE 

72
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:31,618
COMMITTEE, NOMINATED TO CIA, 

73
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,685
AND YOU GOT THE FEELING THAT 

74
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,454
BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONHIP, HE 

75
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,991
WAS BRIEFING DONALD TRUMP ON A 

76
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,459
DAILY BASIS OF DANGERS AROUND 

77
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,761
THE WORLD, THAT HE REALLY WAS 

78
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,563
GOING TO GET SOME OTHER TYPE OF 

79
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:48,334
POSITION, SOME SPECULATION FOR 

80
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,034
ATTORNEY GENERAL, BECAUSE JEFF 

81
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:49,836
SESSIONS AND DONALD TRUMP HAVE 

82
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,004
HAD THEIR UPS AND DOWNS, TO SAY 

83
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,038
THE LEAST, BUT THE TRUMP LOYAL 

84
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,673
TO -- THE TRUMP LOYALISTS LIKE 

85
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,776
THIS PICK, MIKE POMPEO GOT SOME 

86
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,411
DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT, HIS 

87
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,112
CONFIRMATION HEARING IS GOING 

88
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:07,553
TO BE TOUGH, HE WILL HAVE THE 

89
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:08,755
VOTES, HE GOT 66 LAST TIME, HE 

90
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:09,622
ONLY NEEDS 51 THIS TIME. 

91
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:10,823
>> SO YOU DON'T THINK IT WILL 

92
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:11,691
BE DIFFICULT? 

93
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,892
BUT A LOT OF QUESTIONS, BUT HE 

94
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,662
IS RESPECTED ACROSS THE AISLE, 

95
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:16,663
AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, HE WILL 

96
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,597
BE CONFIRMED. 

97
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,099
>> WHAT SORT OF ROLE DO YOU 

98
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,634
THINK HE WILL PLAY WITH NORTH 

99
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,537
KOREA?>> I THINK DONALD TRUMP 

100
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,005
AND MIKE POMPEO ARE MORE LIKE-

101
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:29,175
MINDED, AS TRUMP LIKES TO SAY, 

102
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,410
HE LIKES TO BE TOUGH, AND HE 

103
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,844
FELT THAT REX TILLERSON WASN'T 

104
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:37,784
TOUGH ENOUGH, AND TILLERSON WAS 

105
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:38,818
TRYING TO BE A DIPLOMAT, AND 

106
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,652
TRUMP WOULD SAY DON'T WASTE 

107
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,720
YOUR TIME WITH NORTH KOREA, AND 

108
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,155
NOW TRUMP IS VERY MUCH 

109
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,556
INTERESTED IN SITTING DOWN WITH 

110
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:48,994
KIM JONG-UN, IN A HISTORIC 

111
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:50,029
MEETING, AND HE DIDN'T WANT REX

TILLERSON BY HIS SIDE, HE ONCE 

113
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,432
MIKE POMPEO BY HIS SIDE. 

114
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,000
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE IS 

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,935
CLOSE TO HAVE THE CABINET THAT 

116
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:59,438
HE WANTS, COULD HE BE IMPLYING 

117
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:00,306
THAT THERE ARE THE CABINET 

118
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,674
MEMBERS THAT HE'S NOT HAPPY 

119
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,375

ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE ONLY 

124
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,616
PROBLEM THERE IS THAT ROD 

125
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:11,984
ROSENSTEIN WOULD BE THE ACTING 

126
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:12,919
ATTORNEY GENERAL AS HE SEARCHES 

127
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,955
FOR A NEW ONE, BUT IT IS CLEAR, 

128
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,656
THIS IS A PIVOTAL POINT AT THE 

129
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:20,793
-- IN THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY, A 

130

00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:03,929
VERY HAPPY WITH THAT DECISION, 

185
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:06,399
A POWERFUL DECISION, THAT LEFT 

186
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,602
NO DOUBT.>> BUT FOLKS ARE NOT 

187
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:13,740
UNITED ON THIS, THE DEMOCRATS 

188
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,173
ARE GOING TO ISSUE THEIR OWN 

189
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:16,275
REPORT, WHAT YOU THINK THEIR 

190
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,276
CONCLUSIONS MIGHT SAY? 

191
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:22,782
BUT REPUBLICANS AS EARLY AS 

192
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,850
TODAY ARE GOING TO DELIVER A 

193
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,150
150 PAGE REPORT TO THE 

194
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,385
DEMOCRATS, THE MAJORITY 

195
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,453
OPINION, AND THEN A MINORITY 

196
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:28,921
OPINION, THEY ARE GOING TO 

197
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:32,792
COUNTER THAT. WE WILL SEE THOSE 

198
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,492
REPORTS, MAYBE SOME REDACTED, 

199
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:38,464
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT. 

200
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,331
THIS IS NOT SURPRISING, THIS 

201
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:40,199
COMMITTEE, WHICH USED TO WORK 

202
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,400
ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS, HAS JUST 

203
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,301
BEEN A PARTISAN BATTLEGROUND. 

204
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,803
AND I THINK THIS IS CLEARING 

205
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:47,406
THE WAY FOR THE PRESIDENT 

206
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,874
ELUDING THAT IT IS OVER, NO 

207
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:50,275
COLLUSION, AND WE HAVE ALREADY 

208
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:53,212
HEARD FROM SOME CONSERVATIVES, 

209
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,246
IT IS TIME FOR ROBERT MUELLER 

210
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,015
TO WRAP UP HIS INVESTIGATION. 

211
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:56,983
OF COURSE, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO 

212
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,184
LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAY, AND 

213
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,320
THE OTHER THING IS, TIMING, 

214
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,421
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, 

215
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,090
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, ALSO DOING 

216
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,391
INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE NOT 

217
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,527
WRAPPED UP, IF THEY WRAP UP IN 

218
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,096
THE NEAR FUTURE, THAT I THINK 

219
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,731
THERE WOULD BE SOME PRESSURE ON 

220
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,099
ROBERT MUELLER. 

221
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:14,901
THE PROBLEM FOR ROBERT MUELLER 

222
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:15,935
IS THE TIMING OF WHATEVER HE 

223
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,303
ELEASES WHAT HE'S GOING TO 

224
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:18,337
RELEASE, WE CAN'T DO IT RIGHT 

225
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,906
BEFORE THE ELECTION, I THINK 

226
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:23,643
THERE IS A DECENT SHOT THAT HIS 

227
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,343
INVESTIGATION GOES BEYOND THE 

228
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,277
MIDTERM ELECTION. 

229
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:27,980
>> IS AT THE ROBERT MUELLER 

230
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,249
INVESTIGATION THEY ARE WATCHING?

231
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,617
YOU MENTIONED THE CREDIBILITY, 

232
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:37,290
TAINTED, NOT BIPARTISAN, VERY 

233
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:37,790
PARTISAN, AND THEIR 

234
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,392
CREDIBILITY, IS IT JUST SHOT AT 

235
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,227
THIS POINT?>> I THINK IT IS, 

236
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,130
THAT PANEL IS BROKEN, BOTH 

237
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,164
SIDES SAY, THEY FINGER POINT TO 

238
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,066
THE OTHER SIDE IS THE REASON, 

239
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:47,900
THE SENATE PANELS GET ALONG 

240
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,302
MUCH BETTER, BUT AT THE SAME 

241
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,903
TIME, ROBERT MUELLER IS THE ONE 

242
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:55,274
MAKING NEWS, HE IS LOOKING AS 

243
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,142
IN-DEPTH AS ANYBODY IT SEEMS, 

244
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,677
HE'S GOT THE AUTHORITY TO DO 

245
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,878
THAT, SO I THINK THE FINAL SAY 

246
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,145
WILL BE ROBERT MUELLER, 

247
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:06,452
PERIOD.>>> THE PRESIDENT WILL 

248
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,119
BE INSPECTING PROTOTYPES FOR 

249
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,821
THE LONG PROMISED WALL ON THE 

250
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,624
MEXICO BORDER, CONGRESS HAS YET 

251
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,525
TO PROVIDE THE ESTIMATED $20 

252
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:16,262
BILLION ON HOW TO BUILD THIS. 

253
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,129
REMIND US AGAIN, WHERE DOES 

254
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,464
CONGRESS STAND ON THE 

255
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,066
PRESIDENTS WALL PROPOSAL?>> 

256
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,767
THEY ARE NOT CLOSE TO PASSING A 

257
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:22,668
WALL PROPOSAL, THERE WAS TALK 

258
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,973
OF A BIG DEAL WHERE PRESIDENT 

259
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:27,672
TRUMP WOULD GIVE THE DEMOCRATS 

260
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:28,608
WHAT THEY WANT ON DREAMERS, AND 

261
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,911
TRUMP WOULD GET HIS WALL, OR 

262
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:38,484
FUNDING FOR HIS WALL, THEY PUT 

263
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,485
THAT ON THE TABLE, BUT THEY 

264
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,486
PULLED BACK, I DON'T SEE ANY 

265
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,554
DEAL ON IMMIGRATION HAPPENING 

266
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,087
ANYTIME SOON, ESPECIALLY 

267
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:43,554
BECAUSE THE DREAMERS ARE NOT IN 

268
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:44,790
DANGER OF BEING DEPORTED, EVEN 

269
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,727
THOUGH WE ARE PAST MARCH 5, 

270
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:53,065
BECAUSE OF COURT BATTLES, SO 

271
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:53,966
UNTIL WE GET ANOTHER RULING, 

272
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,536
THE WALL IS DEAD AND THE 

273
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,770
DREAMERS ARE CERTAINLY STALLED. 

274
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,273

282
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,755
DIRECT CALL FROM THE PRESIDENT, 

283
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,223
MAYBE WE WILL GET SOME 

284
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,392
CLARIFICATION, AND IF HE HAS A 

285
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,461
REASON AS TO WHY HE WAS FIRED.

DON'T MESS WITH HER, SHE WAS 

296
00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,598
NOT JUST A WORKER BECAUSE SHE 

297

WAS AN ARCHITECT OF THE ENHANCED
