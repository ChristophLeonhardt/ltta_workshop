National Geographic admits they are guilty of sensationalizing images of a starving polar bear but now that National Geographic has said that they went too far with their let's be honest lies let's see how sincere all the pro science people are in their Mia culpa hint they aren't sincere at all remember that video last year that video captured by a photographer and a videographer for the ocean conservation group see legacy featuring an ailing bear went viral it was definitive proof according to National Geographic that deadly climate change was causing an extinction of polar bears I'm going to look like that bear when I'm as far advanced in my life is that bear was scraggly white hair draggin myself around hopelessly it's fine that's the lifecycle of an apex predator like me and like that bear when you're at the top of the food change disease and old age tends to get you that's nature nearly immediately after that video was launched people who knew anything about bears and apex predators and the North immediately called shenanigans on it the outrage was instant it took nearly eight months but now National Geographic is admitting they were wrong now I won't say what they did was a mistake and actually neither do they because I think this whole thing was purposeful the photographer who captured the images on Somerset Island Christine emitter Meyer says that National Geographic went too far with their caption that this is what climate change looks like a National Geographic agrees with her leaving this editorial note on a story in their August 2018 edition National Geographic went too far in drawing a definitive connection between climate change and a particular starving polar bear in the opening caption of our video about the animal we said this is what climate change looks like while science has established there is a strong connection between melting sea ice and polar bears dying off there is no way to know for certain why this bear was on the verge of death right fine except despite all the constant fear-mongering about melting sea ice bear populations in the north are ever increasing thanks for sciencing so hard National Geographic so-now National Geographic has published a new version of that original video with a new tagline this is what a starving polar bear looks like but according to the photographer that took the video 2.5 billion people were reached by that National Geographic original footage and even more dishonestly the original video itself is still up on national Geographics YouTube page with the same catchphrase this is what climate change looks like the video has over 1.6 million views it's the most popular video on their YouTube page so National Geographic can apologize and lament for the cessation ization of dead bears till they're blue in the face but they don't really mean any of it because they're keeping the lies up to both monetize them and scare you look down here in the YouTube video in the comments description about National Geographic National Geographic is the world's premium destination for science exploration and adventure now for accuracy I'd also add that National Geographic is a premium destination for insincere BS interestingly Google's own YouTube is now applying disclaimers to videos that question climate change so where is the disclaimer for this garbage attributing everything and anything to climate change like old age and hunger but it's not just National Geographic leaving a lie fake news up to be repeated as gospel because it fits a climate change agenda Canada's own environment and climate change minister who specializes in weather long-haul jet flights and Twitter gaffes still has her Tweetup on her Twitter site about the bear being definitive proof of climate change what happened here is that National Geographic thought and probably still thinks the public is stupid and are easily misled and now they're finding out eight four months later that's just not true National Geographic might catch some true believers like Catherine McKenna but they'll never pull a climate change snow job on you for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read big Tekin Silicon Valley is a real penchant for censoring conservatives and climate change skeptics but we have the rebel have a way around that we have our own rebel media mobile app it's available on the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store download it give it a try and help us fight the censorship from big tech wherever you go you
