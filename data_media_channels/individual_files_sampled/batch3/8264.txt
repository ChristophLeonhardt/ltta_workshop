GAVE THEM A JUNE 15TH DEADLINE TO FINISH, MARTHA. Martha: ED, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO COREY LEWANDOWSKI STANDING BY. COREY, YOU KNOW MICHAEL COHEN VERY WELL. YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HIM. ARE THERE TAPES? HAS HE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT AUDIOTAPES AND IS THE PRESIDENT ON THEM? YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO MICHAEL ABOUT IT. WHAT WE DO KNOW NOW IS THAT ATTORNEY AVENATTI HAS ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY HE WANTS TO DO WHICH IS SELF-PROMOTION. HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THIS CASE AND THE JUDGE SAID EITHER YOU CAN JOIN THE CASE AND BE QUIET OR CONTINUE TO GO ON TELEVISION AND PROMOTE YOURSELF AND THIS IS A MAN, I THINK IT WAS JUST SETTLED A LAWSUIT $10 MILLION HIMSELF AVENATTI DID. HIS GOAL IS TO GO OUT AND GET AS MUCH FREE PUBLICITY AS HE CAN BY HIMSELF AND NOT SEE ANY JUSTICE PERFORMED HERE. Martha: REPORTS WERE THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY UPSET WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THIS RAID ON COHEN'S OFFICE. ONE MORE TIME, ARE THERE TAPES AND IS THE PRESIDENT ON THEM? I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE TAPES AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE PRESIDENT IS ON THEM. LOOK, YOU HAVE TO THINK IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY THIS IS UNPARALLEL DOLLARS UNUNP THIS IS UNPARALLEL DOLLARS UNUNR THIS IS UNPARALLEL DOLLARS UNUNL THIS IS UNPARALLEL DOLLARS UNUNE THIS IS UNPARALLEL DOLLARS UNUNL THIS IS UNPARALLEL DOLLARS UNUND THIS IS UNPARALLEL DOLLARS UNUNT THIS IS UNPARALLEL DOLLARS UNUNA THIS IS UNPARALLEL DOLLARS UNUNT THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY IS RAIDED WHILE HE IS SITTING IN OFFICE. CAN YOU IMAGINE FOR ONE SECOND IF IT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RAIDED HIS OWN PERSONAL ATTORNEY? THE MEDIA WOULD BE IN AN UPROAR AND HAS BEEN VERY LIMITED UPROAR. THERE IS A SERIOUS CONCERN HERE ABOUT ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT AT ONE PERIOD OF TIME MICHAEL COHEN WAS THE PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY AND THE CONVERSATIONS HE HAD WERE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND ARE PART OF THAT ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE. WHICH MICHAEL CANNOT REVEAL. THAT IS UP TO THE CLIENT TO REVEAL. AND DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS THE CLIENT. Martha: IF THAT'S THE CASE, THERE WILL BE A BATTLE
