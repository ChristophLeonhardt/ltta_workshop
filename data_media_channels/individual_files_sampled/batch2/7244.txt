recently people on social media Twitter to be specific we're sharing a tweet that Sarah Huckabee Sanders had tweeted over a year ago on November 3rd of 2016 and it had to do with Hillary Clinton and the fact that James Comey was investigating Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server now there was some criticism by Hillary's camp toward the FBI as a result of that investigation and so here's what Sarah Sanders had tweeted at the time when you're attacking FBI agents because you're under criminal investigation you're losing hmm thank you now that preach it that tweet didn't age like a fine wine okay because you fast forward to recent news and recent tweets by Donald Trump himself and there's a little bit of a different tune here's what Donald Trump recently tweeted after years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation and more running the FBI its reputation is in tatters worse than history but fear not we will bring it back to greatness so he's attacking the FBI while he is under investigation I guess that means he's losing I thought we were gonna get tired of winning by now it turns out was tired of losing yeah hey I want to go back to Trump's tweet put that back up if you don't mind a sis because I want to point out a couple of things one is as usual the unnecessary exclamation point hmm kind of like his the tweet where they claim was written by a lawyer where he admitted obstruction of justice that's very similar secondly I'd like to point out something else why does he randomly Capra capitalizes yes I've noticed that too I don't care chatters yes so history has no business being capitalized there I really can't make an argument for it but fine I I I'm past that tatters lies tatters gabba lies he's a child he doesn't even know grammar he doesn't know anything he's so monumentally stupid just a side note right I look I think that the lack of sleep and the poor diet is starting to really impact him well starting impacts him negatively he needs to get some rest he needs to stop watching cable news and he needs to get away from social media I look glasshouse on poor diets you can't comment on that one you back to you okay if you like this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
