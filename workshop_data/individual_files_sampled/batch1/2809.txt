I'm pretty sure it was a poet or a great scholar that once said we're genetically engineered to flirt if we don't flirt we don't have sex and if we don't have sex we don't reproduce but in order for the flirting process to begin a man has to be physically attracted to a woman how does this happen I talked to dr. midge Wilson at DePaul University and she said that any time a man checks out a woman he's actually performing what Wilson calls a reproductive fitness assessment it's the combination of a number of factors that have been scientifically proven to make women physically attractive to men according to New Zealand anthropologist Barnaby Dixon men prefer a larger waist to hips ratio of seven to ten over a closer ratio of nine to ten the waist and hips are important factors when it comes to childbirth so when men see a ratio that they perceive to be favorable they're subconsciously thinking she could have my baby researchers at University College London determined a higher-pitched female voice is more likely to be perceived by men as attractive the high voice not only signifies youth but also a smaller body a couple of German scientists said that long lustrous healthy hair plays a big part in female attractiveness again Cano ting health and fertility of course none of these factors can be controlled at least not naturally but here are a few scientifically proven attractors that women can achieve on their own scientists at the University of British Columbia sites smiling is a major factor in what makes women attractive the whiter the teeth the better but interestingly enough women actually prefer the opposite for men women prefer a guy who keeps a straight face a study at Bangor University showed that men preferred women who wore up to 40% fewer cosmetics the natural look is in according to a study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology the color red enhances males attraction to females this also goes for animals the study found the same affecting some non-human primates to review here some of the scientifically proven factors that make women physically attractive a waist-to-hip ratio of seven to ten a higher voice healthy hair smiling less makeup and the color red follow these steps and the human race should be around for a long time to come what he said
