PRESIDENT, SHE HAS SAID PUBLICLY

21
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,068
IN THE PAST SHE WAS NOT AFRAID

00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,435
TO LET THE PRESIDENT KNOW WHEN 

23
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:38,071
SHE DISAGREED WITH HIM.

24
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,238
RECENTLY IN RESPONSE TO THAT

SAYING THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT 

28
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,344
SHUT OUT HIS ADVISERS AND SHE 

29
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:46,846
AND OTHERS HAVE OPEN ACCESS TO 

30
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:47,847
THE PRESIDENT.

31
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:48,882
OUR SENIOR WHITE HOUSE

36
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,755
AND REPORTERS WERE NOT SUPPOSED 

37
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,423
TO BE IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

38
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:59,292
THEY WERE CALLED IN SPECIFICALLY

39
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,994
FOR THIS AND INSIDE THE

00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,662
PRESIDENT WAS THERE WITH U.N. 

41
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:03,329
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY SO THIS 

42
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,364
IS WHAT WE KNOW.

43
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,331
THE PRESIDENT SAYS SHE CALLED 

44
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,066
HIM SIX MONTHS AGO AND TOLD HIM 

45
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,568
SHE WANTED OFF OF THIS JOB.

46
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,736
HE SAYS HE'S SORRY TO LOSE HER, 

47
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,371
SEEMS LIKE, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE 

48
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,706
STILL VERY MUCH GOOD FRIENDS AND

49
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,109
SAYS HE CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT 

50
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:16,409
NIKKI HALEY.

51
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,977
SHE WILL BE LEAVING AS YOU 

52
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,245
MENTIONED AT THE END OF THE 

53
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:19,478
YEAR.

54
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:21,581
REPORTERS IN THE ROOM ASKED 

55
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,416
NIKKI HALEY IF SHE PLANS TO RUN 

56
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,752
IN 2020 AND SHE SAID SHE DOES 

57
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,420
NOT, IN FACT, SHE SAID SHE WILL 

58
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,821
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS 

59
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:29,355
RE-ELECTION BID.

60
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,658
SO THIS COMES AS A HUGE 

61
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:32,624
SURPRISE, TOM, I JUST WANT TO 

62
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:34,694
HIT ON THE TIMING OF THIS.

63
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,529
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHY SHE IS 

64
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,497
LEAVING OR WHAT HER EXPLANATION 

65
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:40,400
IS FOR OFFERING THIS RESIGNATION

66
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,701
TO THE PRESIDENT TODAY OR SIX 

67
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:45,872
MONTHS AGO IF HE SAYS THIS 

68
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:46,172
HAPPENED.

69
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,040
LET'S MARK WHAT TODAY IS.

70
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,207
TODAY IS THE DAY WHERE PRESIDENT

71
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:49,976
TRUMP IS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING A 

72
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,877
VICTORY LAP IN THE WAKE OF HIS 

73
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:53,313
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, BRETT 

74
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,315
KAVANAUGH, BEING CONFIRMED AND 

75
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,749
SWORN IN YESTERDAY BY HIM RIGHT 

76
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,618
HERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THIS

77
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,619
IS A DAY WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

78
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,053
IS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AHEAD 

79
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:03,356
TO THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND 

80
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,924
RALLYING HIS BASE USING THAT 

81
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,893
KAVANAUGH VICTORY TO RALLY THE 

82
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:07,460
BASE.

83
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,061
INSTEAD HERE WE ARE WITH A 

84
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:11,564
SURPRISING STAFF SHAKE-UP THAT 

85
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:12,999
SEEMS IT CAME FROM THE 

86
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,767
PRESIDENT'S OWN ANNOUNCEMENT AND

87
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:15,902
REALLY SORT OF A BIG QUESTION AS

88
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,637
TO WHAT REALLY WENT ON HERE 

89
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,705
BEHIND THE SCENES, TOM. 

90
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,273
>> JUST A WEEK AFTER HIS OR TWO 

91
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,975
WEEKS AFTER HIS ADDRESS TO THE 

92
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:24,042
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY.

93
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:26,145
I WANT TO BRING IN GEORGE 

94
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:26,813
STEPHANOPOULOS NOW.

95
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,981
AMBASSADOR HALEY WAS SOMEONE WHO

96
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,583
COULD TALK TO THE PRESIDENT VERY

97
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,685
FRANKLY, NOT AFRAID TO SPEAK HER

98
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:32,885
MIND.

99
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:34,687
AT FIRST THEY HAD SOMEWHAT OF A 

100
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,955
ROCKY RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE SHE 

101
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,590
DIDN'T ENDORSE HIM BUT QUICKLY 

102
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,592
AFTER HE WANTED TO NOMINATE HER 

103
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,828
TO BECOME U.N. AMBASSADOR AN 

104
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,528
PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE. 

105
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:43,529
>> HE DID.

106
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:45,464
SHE ALWAYS TOWED THE PARTY LINE 

107
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:49,569
ON THE IRAN SAFNCTIONS ON NORTH 

108
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,703
KOREA TAKING A HARD LINE BUT 

109
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,971
ALSO SELLING THE PROPOSED DEAL 

110
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,039
AFTER THE PRESIDENT HAD THAT 

111
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,841
SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE.

112
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,743
NOTABLE EXCEPTION ON RUSSIA, 

113
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,211
NIKKI HALEY ALWAYS TOOK A MUCH 

114
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,547
HARDER PUBLIC LINE ON RUSSIA AND

115
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:02,181
VLADIMIR PUTIN THAN PRESIDENT 

116
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,450
TRUMP DID BUT AS YOU NOTE, SHE 

117
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,385
WAS NOT CLOSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP

118
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,586
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

119
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,754
SHE DID NOT ENDORSE HIM UNTIL 

120
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:10,623
VERY LATE IN THE GAME.

121
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:17,497
SHE SPOKE OUT AGAINST HIS MORE 

122
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,731
INTEMPERATE COMMENTS AGE SPOKE 

123
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,765
DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT AND 

124
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:21,767
HOW SHE DIDN'T APPROVE OF THEM 

125
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:24,270
AFTER CHARLOTTESVILLE SO WASN'T 

126
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,970
AFRAID TO CREATE DISTANCE FROM 

127
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,639
THE PRESIDENT AND EVEN THOUGH 

128
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,841
SHE WAS CAREFUL IN THAT OVAL 

129
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,511
OFFICE NEAR THE PRESIDENT, I 

130
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,012
DON'T THINK THAT WILL STOP HIM 

131
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,081
FROM TALKING ABOUT IT 

132
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:35,881
PARTICULARLY IF SOMETHING WOULD 

133
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:36,782
FORCE PRESIDENT TRUMP INTO A 

134
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,117
POSITION WHERE IT SEEMED LIKE 

135
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,352
EITHER HE COULDN'T RUN OR WAS IN

136
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,653
A WEAK POSITION IN 2020. 

137
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,488
>> STILL POPULAR WITH REPUBLICAN

138
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:42,721
VOTERS.

139
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:43,456
GEORGE, THANK YOU.

140
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,858
WANT TO BRING IN MARTHA RADDATZ.

141
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:46,726
MARTHA, QUICKLY, HOW IS THIS 

142
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,227
GOING TO PLAY AROUND THE WORLD?

143
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:50,029
>> Reporter: WELL, I THINK MANY 

144
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,498
OF OUR ALLIES LOOK TO NIKKI 

145
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,600
HALEY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS 

146
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,436
GOING ON IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

147
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,204
WE, OF COURSE, HAVE HAD A WHITE 

148
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,740
HOUSE THAT PLAYS GOOD COP, BAD 

149
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,841
COP WITH FOREIGN POLICY BUT I 

150
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,377
THINK NIKKI HALEY WAS A CALMING,

151
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,612
BUT VERY STRONG VOICE AND, OF 

152
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:08,281
COURSE, LOSING A WOMAN RIGHT NOW

153
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,317
IS DIFFICULT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE

154
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,519
AS WELL BECAUSE IT IS 

155
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,153
ASTONISHING BECAUSE THERE HAVE 

156
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,121
BEEN NO LEAKS.

157
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,055
THIS IS A WHITE HOUSE THAT DID 

158
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,091
NOT WANT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT 

159
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,358
RIGHT NOW, SO THIS REALLY DID 

160
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,492
COME OUT OF NOWHERE. 

161
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:22,295
>> MARTHA RADDATZ AND OUR ENTIRE

162
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,196

IT WILL HAPPEN AT THE END OF THE
