where does vogue stand on free speech why they're against it for conservatives that is look at look at this the very next day after Alex Jones was de personnes was made an outlaw a castaway it's not just Alex Jones youtube's most extreme creators are pushing the platform into a tough debate and censorship and free speech on the Internet's a bit of a grammatical problem with that tweet okay so they have a handy list of people that they think are extreme and it won't surprise you to learn that who rabble alumni are on their list including Lauren southern and Gavin McInnes both of whom have moved on from us but their rebel work is cited as proof of their extremism you can see our logo there now we're conservative and we're a bit dissident not not much compared to how it's Jones I'd say we're one or two standard deviations more centrist than him I mean being a conservative in Canada it's really like being a moderate Democrat in the u.s. don't you think but we're on the official enemies list now I guess take a look search YouTube for videos of integration and eventually you'll find this mass immigration is not the rainbows and unicorns that our politicians portrayed as it is in fact a tragedy search for videos about Islam and you'll find stuff like this by its very nature Islam is an intolerant radical extremist belief system search for feminism and yeah newsflash everybody these videos are all products of what New York Times magazine calls the YouTube raped a growing collection of right-wing vloggers and media operations conspiracy theorists and activists who built sizeable followings on YouTube they warned about mass immigration decry a political correctness and mock out-of-control social justice warriors why am I on camera for this so there's some honesty there there really isn't any extremism they're mad at they're just mad at anyone right-wing including a black Republican woman who disagrees with feminists metz that's our friend Candace Owens imagine calling her extremists because she dares to be a Republican do you think Vox would call someone extreme if they criticized Christianity the same way Paul Joseph Watson criticized Islam no of course not I mean if you type the word Christianity into the vox.com search engine as I did you will find literally 300 anti-christian articles none of them as entertaining as Paul Joseph Watson but all as hostile to Christianity as he is to Islam an opposing open borders immigration I'm sorry that is not an extreme position I've shown you before a poll commissioned by Justin Trudeau's Liberal government in Canada that shows only 8% of Canadians believe we need more immigration but he gave us more immigration I'm sorry it's the 8% that's the extreme fringe by definition not the 92% who think we have an alpha or too many immigrants already this is just setting the narrative though no one with right-wing opinions can be allowed in the public square which these days is online that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
