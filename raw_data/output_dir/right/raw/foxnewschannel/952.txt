00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:00,995
"THE STORY" HOSTED BY

2
00:00:00,995 --> 00:00:02,196
MARTHA MacCALLUM STARTS RIGHT

3
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:02,463
NOW.

4
00:00:02,463 --> 00:00:02,797
MARTHA.

5
00:00:02,797 --> 00:00:04,799
>> Martha: GOOD TO SEE YOU.

6
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,233
THANK YOU.

7
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:06,567
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH AN

8
00:00:06,567 --> 00:00:08,870
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW RIGHT OFF

9
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:09,237
THE TOP.

10
00:00:09,237 --> 00:00:11,272
SOUTH CAROLINA REPRESENTATIVE

11
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:11,973
MARK SANFORD HAS NEVER LOST AN

12
00:00:11,973 --> 00:00:14,141
ELECTION IN HIS LONG CAREER

13
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:14,642
UNTIL LAST NIGHT.

14
00:00:14,642 --> 00:00:16,711
THE REPUBLICAN HAS NOT BEEN SHY

15
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:19,380
WHEN IT COMES TO CRITICIZING THE

16
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:19,747
PRESIDENT.

17
00:00:19,747 --> 00:00:23,651
>> IF YOU WOULD JUST SHUT UP,

18
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:24,385
QUIT ATTACKING -- I DON'T WORK

19
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:28,422
FOR HIM, WORK FOR 750,000 PEOPLE

20
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:29,423
HERE IN THE FIRST CONGRESSIONAL

21
00:00:29,423 --> 00:00:29,991
DISTRICT.

22
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:30,791
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD

23
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,093
IN INTERVIEWS ABOUT DRUM, HE'S

24
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:33,394
NOT SORRY FOR ANYTHING.

25
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:34,996
I THINK THAT'S A PROFOUND

26
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:35,329
MISTAKE.

27
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:36,063
>> Martha: COMMENTS LIKE THAT

28
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:39,467
THAT MAY HAVE LED TO A STINGING

29
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:40,034
LAST-MINUTE TWEET FROM

30
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:41,269
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT WENT LIKE

31
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:41,769
THIS.

32
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:42,670
MARK SANFORD HAS BEEN VERY

33
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,572
UNHELPFUL TO ME IN MY CAMPAIGN

34
00:00:44,572 --> 00:00:45,606
TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

35
00:00:45,606 --> 00:00:47,208
HE IS M.I.A. AND NOTHING BUT

36
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:47,542
TROUBLE.

37
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:49,610
HE IS BETTER OFF IN ARGENTINA.

38
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,945
I FULLY ENDORSE KATIE ARRINGTON

39
00:00:50,945 --> 00:00:54,115
FOR CONGRESSMAN IN

40
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:56,150
SOUTH CAROLINA, SHE'S TOUGH ON

41
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,152
CRIME, VOTE KATIE SAID THE

42
00:00:58,152 --> 00:00:58,986
PRESIDENT.

43
00:00:58,986 --> 00:00:59,620
SANFORD'S OPPONENT KATIE

44
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,790
ARRINGTON ALSO WENT AFTER HIM IN

45
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,591
ADS LIKE THIS.

46
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:05,259
>> I'M RUNNING FOR CONGRESS TO

47
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:06,761
GET THINGS DONE, NOT TO GO ON

48
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:09,230
CNN TO BASH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

49
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,100
IT'S TIME FOR MARK SANFORD TO

50
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,602
TAKE A HIKE, FOR REAL THIS TIME.

51
00:01:14,602 --> 00:01:15,369
>> Martha: LAST NIGHT BEFORE

52
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:16,070
THE FINAL VOTES WERE COUNTED

53
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,574
MARK SANFORD WAS FEARING THE

54
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:20,775
WORST.

55
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:21,475
>> IT'S FAIRLY UNUSUAL FOR A

56
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:23,511
PRESIDENT TO TWEET IN A

57
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:24,412
CONGRESSIONAL RACE.

58
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:26,314
I'M NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST

59
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:27,048
FROM.

60
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:29,116
I'M FOR IDEAS THAT I HAVE LONG

61
00:01:29,116 --> 00:01:31,185
STOOD FOR OVER THE ENTIRETY OF

62
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:33,588
MY TIME IN POLITICS.

63
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:34,622
IT MAY HAVE COST ME AN ELECTION

64
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:36,791
IN THIS CASE BUT I STAND BY

65
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:37,491
EVERYONE OF THOSE DECISIONS.

66
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:38,225
>> Martha: 'S SEAN SPICER WILL

67
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:39,860
JOIN US IN JUST A MOMENT ON

68
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,395
WHETHER HE THINKS THIS IS A

69
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:42,763
LESSON PERHAPS FOR OTHER

70
00:01:42,763 --> 00:01:43,497
REPUBLICANS RUNNING IN THE

71
00:01:43,497 --> 00:01:43,864
MIDTERMS.

72
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:45,833
HERE EXCLUSIVELY TONIGHT, WE ARE

73
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:46,968
GLAD TO HAVE SOUTH CAROLINA

74
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:48,502
CONGRESSMAN MARK SANFORD JOINING

75
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:48,769
US.

76
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:49,337
CONGRESSMAN, WELCOME.

77
00:01:49,337 --> 00:01:52,206
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.

78
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:53,107
OBVIOUSLY LAST NIGHT WAS A ROUGH

79
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:53,608
NIGHT FOR YOU.

80
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,843
YOU HAD A VERY STRONG, LONG

81
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:56,577
CAREER IN POLITICS IN

82
00:01:56,577 --> 00:01:57,211
SOUTH CAROLINA.

83
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:57,912
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT

84
00:01:57,912 --> 00:02:00,114
PRESIDENT TRUMP COST YOU THIS

85
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:01,148
ELECTION?

86
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:05,219
>> I WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS THE

87
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,355
TWEET, BUT IT WAS REDUCED TOWN

88
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:09,389
IT WAS FOR TRUMP VERSUS NOT.

89
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,390
I LOST THAT RACE.

90
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,392
>> Martha: DO YOU SAY THAT AS

91
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:12,593
A WARNING TO OTHER CANDIDATES

92
00:02:12,593 --> 00:02:12,994
OUT THERE?

93
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:14,662
WOULD YOU CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT

94
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:18,399
YOUR CAMPAIGN?

95
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,301
>> WE ALWAYS MONDAY AFTERNOON,

96
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:21,035
QUARTERBACK CAMPAIGNS AND THOSE

97
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:21,802
THINGS YOU COULD'VE DONE A

98
00:02:21,802 --> 00:02:22,803
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY, THAT'S

99
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:24,005
THE NATURE OF LIFE.

100
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,039
BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THIS,

101
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,241
THE WARNING IS FOR ALL OF US

102
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:29,577
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT MY ACTUAL

103
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:30,778
VOTING RECORD I HAVE BEEN WITH

104
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:34,782
THE PRESIDENT 89% OF THE TIME,

105
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:35,883
SO 11% I HAVE DISAGREED ON, BUT

106
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:37,785
I LOVE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

107
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:38,486
IT DOESN'T MEAN I AGREE WITH

108
00:02:38,486 --> 00:02:43,190
THEM ON 100%, 100% OF THE TIME.

109
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,392
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL

110
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:46,694
OF US TO STOP AND SAY WAIT A

111
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:48,396
MINUTE WE HAVE AN INSTITUTION

112
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:51,565
SET UP BY THE FOUNDING FATHERS,

113
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:52,166
WHERE VIGOROUS DISSENT,

114
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:57,004
DISAGREEMENT WAS PART OF IT.

115
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:57,772
THEY WANT THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

116
00:02:57,772 --> 00:02:59,774
TO BE A CHECK ON THE EXECUTIVE

117
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:00,608
BRANCH AND VICE VERSA.

118
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,610
WHEN WE LOSE THAT, IF THE LITMUS

119
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,979
TEST OF OUR ELECTIONS, WHO IS

120
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,982
100% IN ALLEGIANCE WITH SOMEBODY

121
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:11,719
ELSE, I THINK WE HAVE LOST AN

122
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,620
AWFULLY IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT

123
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,989
MAKES OUR COUNTRY SPECIAL AND

124
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:16,791
UNIQUE BASED ON THE FOUNDING

125
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,258
FATHERS DESIGN.

126
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:17,992
>> Martha: DO YOU THINK IT WAS

127
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:18,893
WRONG FOR HIM TO DO THAT?

128
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:20,394
TO PUT THAT WEED OUT THERE AND

129
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:21,328
GET INVOLVED IN THE PRIMARY AT

130
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:23,631
THAT LATE MOMENT?

131
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:24,198
>> IT'S AMERICA.

132
00:03:24,198 --> 00:03:25,599
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO DO WHAT

133
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,668
THEY ARE GOING TO DO AND THE

134
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:29,103
PREROGATIVE TO DO WHAT HE WANTS

135
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:30,004
TO DO ON THAT FRONT.

136
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:32,139
BUT AGAIN, THE ISSUE IS DO WE

137
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:36,243
WANT TO HAVE LITMUS TEST, AND

138
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:37,678
ALLEGIANCE TEST IN RUNNING FOR

139
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:39,180
OFFICE, OR DO WE SAY LOOK, IF

140
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,384
YOU ARE WITH ME 90% OF THE TIME,

141
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:46,020
BECAUSE I VOTED FOR EVERY SINGLE

142
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,588
AGENDA --

143
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:49,423
>> Martha: MAY BE THE REVERSE

144
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:49,857
IS ALSO TRUE.

145
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:51,292
IF  IF YOU ARE AGREEING SO MUCHW

146
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:51,325
IF  IF YOU ARE AGREEING SO MUCHT

147
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:51,792
IF  IF YOU ARE AGREEING SO MUCHH

148
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:52,560
THE THINGS THAT HE'S PUTTING OUT

149
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,561
THERE AND YOU ARE VOTING WITH

150
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:57,431
HIM 90% OF THE TIME, WHY GO ON

151
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:59,200
TV AND BASH THEM IF YOU FEEL

152
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,201
LIKE GENERALLY HE'S MOVING IN

153
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:02,203
THE DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO?

154
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:03,204
>> IT'S NOT A BASH.

155
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:04,572
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE GOING RIGHT

156
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:05,973
NOW.

157
00:04:05,973 --> 00:04:06,874
I WENT TO BUSINESS SCHOOL AT THE

158
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:07,608
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND THEY

159
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:10,978
BELIEVE IN THE SOCRATIC PROCESS,

160
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:12,279
YOU THREW AN IDEA DOWN THE

161
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,881
MIDDLE AND YOU'RE DEBATED LONG

162
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:14,215
ENOUGH.

163
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:15,382
>> Martha: ABSOLUTELY.

164
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:16,016
>> AND THAT IS IMPORTANT.

165
00:04:16,016 --> 00:04:18,586
THAT'S THE AMERICAN WAY.

166
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:19,286
WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE.

167
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:21,988
I FOR INSTANCE VOTED AGAINST THE

168
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:22,423
OMNIBUS BILL.

169
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:24,191
I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT BOAT.

170
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,192
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF AS LEADER

171
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:28,062
SAID HE WON'T SIGN ANY MORE THAT

172
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:28,562
SAID HE WON'T SIGN ANY MORE THA

173
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:28,863
THAT.

174
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:31,632
BUT TO SAY I DISAGREE WITH WITH

175
00:04:31,632 --> 00:04:34,769
THE BILL ULTIMATELY IS AGAIN A

176
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,337
STAND TIED TO ISSUES AND BELIEFS

177
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:39,240
THAT I HAVE LONG HELD THAT ARE

178
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,974
IMPORTANT TO THE CONSTITUENTS

179
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:42,676
THAT I REPRESENT.

180
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:52,086
I DON'T VIEW IT AS SOMETHING

181
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:52,820
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT THOUGH IT

182
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,521
WAS CERTAINLY CAST A SOMETHING

183
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:53,954
IN THIS RACE.

184
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:54,555
>> Martha: THIS IS WHAT

185
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:55,256
SENATOR BOB CORKER SAID ABOUT

186
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:55,990
REPUBLICANS AND THE PARTY RIGHT

187
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,257
NOW.

188
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:56,957
>> WE ARE IN A STRANGE PLACE.

189
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:58,425
IT'S ALMOST -- IT'S BECOMING A

190
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:58,926
CULTISH THING.

191
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:01,395
IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR ANY

192
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:03,831
PARTY TO END UP WITH A CULT-LIKE

193
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:09,203
SITUATION AS IT RELATES TO A

194
00:05:09,203 --> 00:05:12,807
PRESIDENT THAT HAPPENS TO BE

195
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:13,507
REPORTEDLY OF THE SAME PARTY.

196
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:14,508
>> Martha: WHAT YOU THINK

197
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:18,445
ABOUT THAT?

198
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:19,246
>> WHAT MY OPPONENT SAID LAST

199
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:20,681
NIGHT, HER WORDS WERE THIS IS

200
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,616
THE PARTY OF DONALD DRAKE FROM.

201
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:23,584
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S THE PARTY

202
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:25,586
OF DONALD DRAKE TRUMP.

203
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:27,955
IT IS THE PARTY OF THE TAXPAYERS

204
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:29,190
OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA

205
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,425
AND FLORIDA AND GO ACROSS EVERY

206
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,394
STATE IN THIS UNION.

207
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:34,128
THERE WERE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS

208
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:35,029
OUT THERE WHO WORKED THEIR

209
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:38,799
SOULS, THEY WORKED HARD FOR

210
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:39,466
YEARS STUFFING ENVELOPES AND

211
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:41,702
DOING ALL THE THINGS YOU DO IN

212
00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:42,069
POLITICS.

213
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:42,803
THAT'S WHO THE PARTY BELONGS TO

214
00:05:42,803 --> 00:05:45,773
IN THIS NOTION THAT ANYBODY AT

215
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:48,209
THE TOP -- WE ARE A NATION OF

216
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,544
LAWS AND NOT MEN, SHOULD SOMEHOW

217
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:51,011
BE THE PERSON --

218
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:52,079
>> Martha: IT SOUNDS TO ME

219
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,248
THAT YOU JUST DON'T LIKE HIM

220
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:56,817
PERSONALLY, BUT MOST OF THE

221
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:57,718
TIME, 90% OF THE TIME YOU LIKE

222
00:05:57,718 --> 00:06:01,188
WHAT HE'S DOING.

223
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:03,390
IS IT PERSONAL FOR YOU, AND IS

224
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,893
THAT NECESSARILY WISE?

225
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:08,229
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMY,

226
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:08,896
YOU LOOK AT NORTH KOREA, YOU

227
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:09,496
LOOK ACROSS THE BOARD.

228
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:11,398
DOES ANY PART OF YOU SAY MAYBE I

229
00:06:11,398 --> 00:06:17,171
SHOULD HAVE JUST SORT OF --

230
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:17,638
>> NOT DISAGREE?

231
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:18,339
>> Martha: KEPT TO MYSELF

232
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:20,374
ABOUT HOW I FELT ABOUT HIM

233
00:06:20,374 --> 00:06:21,208
PERSONALLY.

234
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,077
>> I WOULD ASK YOU TO LOOK AT MY

235
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:23,410
RECORD.

236
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,979
I HAVE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT

237
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,049
HIM PERSONALLY.

238
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:29,917
WHAT I HAVE DISAGREED WITH WERE

239
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:32,219
CERTAIN STANDS THAT HE TOOK AND

240
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:33,787
I THINK THAT IS LEGITIMATE FAIR

241
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:34,788
GAME IN THE WORLD OF POLITICS.

242
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:36,991
>> Martha: IT CERTAINLY IS,

243
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:37,391
ABSOLUTELY.

244
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:39,159
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

245
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:43,197
IS YOUR CAREER OVER IN POLITICS?

246
00:06:43,197 --> 00:06:45,599
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

247
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:46,634
>> BELIEVE ME, I'VE LEARNED

248
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:47,801
NEVER TO SAY NEVER, BUT THAT

249
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:49,937
WOULD CERTAINLY BE MY TAKE.

250
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:51,672
BUT IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO

251
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,040
REPRESENT FOLKS BACK HOME IN

252
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,775
SOUTH CAROLINA FOR A WHILE NOW.

253
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:56,977
I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A

254
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:58,812
WAKE-UP CALL ABOUT THE

255
00:06:58,812 --> 00:07:01,148
INSTITUTIONS OF OUR COUNTRY,

256
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:03,183
ABOUT WHAT WE BELIEVE ON THAT

257
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:04,952
FRONT AND ULTIMATELY A WAKE-UP

258
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:06,520
CALL WITH REGARD TO THE

259
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,390
REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THOSE

260
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,090
STRONG STANDS IN TERMS OF

261
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,594
CONSERVATISM AND TAX POLICY

262
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:14,595
MATTER MORE OR DOES ALLEGIANCE

263
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:15,095
THAT ARE MORE?

264
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:17,364
>> Martha: WOULD YOU AND FOLKS

265
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:18,399
LIKE BOB CORKER SPLITTING OFF

266
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,833
AND MAYBE RUNNING A CANDIDATE

267
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,703
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT IN 2020?

268
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:24,171
>> NO.

269
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:24,872
I'M A DAY OUT OF MY ELECTION.

270
00:07:24,872 --> 00:00:00,000
I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON MAKING A
