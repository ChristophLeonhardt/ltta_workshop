1
00:00:00,514 --> 00:00:01,648
JOHNSON, REPUBLICAN FROM

2
00:00:01,648 --> 00:00:03,083
WISCONSIN WHO CHAIRS THE

3
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:04,251
HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AND

4
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:06,887
SERVES ON THE FOREIGN RELATIONS

5
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:07,254
COMMITTEE.

6
00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:09,890
JAMES COMEY IS A MAN WHO HAS

7
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,592
PRIDED HIMSELF ON HIS

8
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:16,496
REPUTATION, HIS ETHICS, HIS GOOD

9
00:00:16,496 --> 00:00:18,131
STANDING, BUT THIS REPORT WOULD

10
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:21,368
SEEM THE SNIPPETS WE'VE HEARD,

11
00:00:21,368 --> 00:00:23,170
SEEMS TO PAINT HIM IN A

12
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:23,870
DIFFERENT LIGHT.

13
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,872
>> JON, I'VE NOT SEEN THE

14
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:26,440
REPORT.

15
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,676
I'M LOOKING ANXIOUSLY FORWARD TO

16
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:31,144
VERY VIEWING.

17
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:33,380
IT'S ABOUT 500 PAGES.

18
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,182
I'M SURE IT'S IN DETAIL.

19
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:36,783
MICHAEL HOROWITZ DID A GREAT JOB

20
00:00:36,783 --> 00:00:38,085
WITH THE REPORT.

21
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:41,288
POINTING OUT HOW HE LIED TO THE

22
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:43,290
FBI INVESTIGATORS THREE TIMES

23
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:43,790
UNDER OATH.

24
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,694
I'VE BEEN SAYING A LONG TIME THE

25
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:48,929
INVESTIGATION UNDER --

26
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,031
CONCERNING HILLARY CLINTON'S

27
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,266
E-MAIL SCANDAL WAS NOT ROBUST

28
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:53,734
INVESTIGATION.

29
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:57,304
IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO UNCOVER

30
00:00:57,304 --> 00:00:59,139
THE TRUTH AND LEAD TO

31
00:00:59,139 --> 00:00:59,539
PROSECUTION.

32
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,608
IT WAS MORE DESIGNED TO COVER UP

33
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:03,410
THE TRUTH AND EXONERATE.

34
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,644
THAT'S WHAT JAMES COMEY DID.

35
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:05,979
I'M NOT SURPRISED ABOUT ANYTHING

36
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:07,280
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORTS ON

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,815
THAT I BELIEVE LOOKING FORWARD

38
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:10,784
TO SEEING THE REPORT.

39
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:14,087
>> SO THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY,

40
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:17,791
WHICH CAUSED SUCH AN OUTBURST

41
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,093
EARLY IN THIS ADMINISTRATION,

42
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:22,396
YOU WOULD SEEM TO SUPPORT THE

43
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:23,930
PRESIDENT'S DECISION.

44
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,532
>> ROD ROSENSTEIN LIED OUT THE

45
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:28,235
CASE OF HOW HE VIOLATED ALL

46
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:30,270
KINDS OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

47
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,471
GUIDELINES IN TERMS OF HOW THE

48
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:33,407
FBI SHOULD ACT WHEN IT COMES TO

49
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:33,840
INVESTIGATION.

50
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,776
SO YOU KNOW, IF ANYBODY WANTS TO

51
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:39,112
GET PREPARED FOR THE INSPECTOR

52
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:41,248
GENERAL REPORT GO TO OUR WEB

53
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:44,351
PAGE AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE

54
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:46,353
INTERIM REPORT ON THE FBI'S

55
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:46,787
INVESTIGATION.

56
00:01:46,787 --> 00:01:49,022
WE PREPARED THAT IN FEBRUARY OF

57
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:49,856
2018.

58
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:51,892
LAYS OUT THE BASIC TIME LINE OF

59
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:53,427
ALL OF THESE EVENTS.

60
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:54,795
IT'S NOT QUITE UP TO DATE.

61
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:57,931
WE'LL BE MAKING IT UP TO DATE

62
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:59,866
WHEN WE SEE THE INSPECTOR

63
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,067
GENERAL'S REPORT.

64
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:02,269
AND WE GET MORE EVIDENCE FROM

65
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:03,503
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, WHICH

66
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:05,972
IS SLOW AND COMING.

67
00:02:05,972 --> 00:02:08,975
>> THE WHITE HOUSE NO FANS OF

68
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:09,476
JAMES COMEY.

69
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:11,978
HOGAN GIDLEY TO -- ONE OF THE

70
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:14,314
PRESIDENT'S SPOKESMAN HAD THIS

71
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:16,149
TO SAY THIS MORNING ON "FOX AND

72
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:16,516
FRIENDS."

73
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:16,850
LISTEN.

74
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,752
>> JAMES COMEY IS DISGRACED, A

75
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,654
LIAR AND A LEAKER AND

76
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:21,154
DISGRUNTLED.

77
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:22,556
EVERYONE KNOWS WHO JAMES COMEY

78
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:23,490
IS AT THIS POINT.

79
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,692
THE BOOK TOUR HE WENT ON WAS

80
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:26,092
DISGRACEFUL.

81
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:26,860
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND AT THIS POINT

82
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,296
WHAT HE IS AND WHO HE IS AND

83
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:31,431
WHAT HE'S ABOUT.

84
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:32,732
>> Jon: IS THIS CHANGING THE

85
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:35,235
OFFICIAL WASHINGTON IMAGE OF THE

86
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:36,436
FORMER FBI DIRECTOR, SENATOR?

87
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,405
>> I KIND OF AGREE.

88
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:40,373
THE BOOK TOUR WAS NOT A BRIGHT

89
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:42,209
MOMENT FOR JAMES COMEY, NOT BY A

90
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,410
LONG SHOT.

91
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,646
LET'S FACE IT, ANDREW McCABE WAS

92
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:48,482
MARTYR McCABE IN THE INSPECTOR

93
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:50,650
GENERAL'S REPORT SHOWED THAT HE

94
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,952
LIED TO THE FBI.

95
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:53,920
WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAT THEY

96
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,255
SHOULDN'T LIE TO THE FBI

97
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:56,456
INVESTIGATORS THAN THE DEPUTY

98
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:58,191
DIRECTOR AND THEN THE ACTING

99
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:00,193
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI?

100
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:01,995
LISTEN, I CAME UNDER A GREAT

101
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:03,396
DEAL OF THE CRITICISM WHEN I

102
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:04,798
TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLE CORRUPTION

103
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:07,534
AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE

104
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:07,801
FBI.

105
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:09,436
THE McCABE REPORT THAT THERE WAS

106
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:10,837
DEFINITE CORRUPTION.

107
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:13,373
WE'LL SEE HOW EXTENSIVE IT IS.

108
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:15,075
MY WHOLE POINT OF THE

109
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:16,610
INVESTIGATION IS TO MAKE THE

110
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,313
PUBLIC AWARE, FULL DISCLOSURE,

111
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:22,315
SO THAT THE FBI AND THE

112
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:24,351
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CAN REGAIN

113
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,653
THEIR INTEGRITY, THE CREDIBILITY

114
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:28,889
THAT IT NEEDS TO SERVE THE

115
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:29,589
AMERICAN PUBLIC.

116
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:30,857
>> Jon: LET ME TAKE YOU TO

117
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:31,892
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT'S COME TO

118
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:34,194
LIGHT IN WASHINGTON.

119
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:35,695
THAT IS THAT THE OBAMA

120
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:36,696
ADMINISTRATION SECRETLY GAVE

121
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:39,933
IRAN ACCESS TO THE U.S.

122
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,068
FINANCIAL SYSTEM, THE IDEA BEING

123
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:44,037
THAT THEY WOULD CONVERT BILLIONS

124
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:46,473
OF DOLLARS THAT HAD BEEN FROZEN

125
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:48,375
IN AN OVERSEAS BANK INTO DOLLARS

126
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,577
AND EUROS THROUGH THE U.S.

127
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:52,212
FINANCIAL SYSTEM AT A TIME WHEN

128
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:55,015
CONGRESS WAS BEING TOLD THAT NO

129
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:57,517
SUCH DEAL WAS IN THE WORKS, WAS

130
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:57,918
UNDERWAY.

131
00:03:57,918 --> 00:03:59,553
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

132
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:00,887
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

133
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:02,889
>> IT'S VERY -- PRESIDENT OBAMA

134
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,624
HAD THE GENERAL CONTEMPT FOR

135
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:04,991
CONGRESS.

136
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,593
HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS THE

137
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:08,295
FIRST ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BE

138
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:11,164
CITED IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS.

139
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:12,732
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

140
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:16,435
JUST TOTALLY PLAYS TO THE

141
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:18,271
NARRATIVE OF HOW DESPERATE

142
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:19,072
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS

143
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:20,373
ADMINISTRATION WERE TO STRIKE A

144
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,709
DEAL WITH IRAN, WHICH IS WE WE

145
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,344
GOT SUCH A TERRIBLE DEAL THAT

146
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:25,812
THE PRESIDENT HAD TO PULL

147
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:27,314
OURSELVES OUT OF.

148
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:28,782
DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

149
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:30,650
IT'S VERY SAD.

150
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,952
I'M NOT SURE WHAT MIGHT HAVE

151
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:33,753
BEEN VIOLATED IN DOING THAT.

152
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:36,856
BUT CERTAINLY SHOWS THE CONTEMPT

153
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:37,457
FOR CONGRESS.

154
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:38,692
>> Jon: SOME OF YOUR DEMOCRATIC

155
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:41,294
FELLOW SENATORS ARE SAYING THIS

156
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:44,564
IS MUCH ADIEU ABOUT NOTHING, A

157
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:44,931
NONISSUE.

158
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:46,933
>> WE'LL SEE.

159
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,836
I'D LIKE TO SEE IF ANY LAWS WERE

160
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:51,538
VIOLATED IN DOING THIS IN TERMS

161
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:54,908
OF THE SANCTIONS LAWS THAT WE

162
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:55,241
PASSED.

163
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:56,676
PRESIDENT OBAMA CREDITED FOR

164
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:57,978
BRINGING IRAN TO THE TABLE BUT

165
00:04:57,978 --> 00:04:59,813
HE WAS OPPOSED TO IT WHEN THE

166
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:01,047
SANCTIONS WERE PASSED.

167
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:03,683
TO ME, UNDERSCORES HOW DESPERATE

168
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,085
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS FOR

169
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:06,920
DOING THAT DEAL.

170
00:05:06,920 --> 00:00:00,000
OF COURSE, IRAN UNDERSTOOD THAT
