KEEP THE SENATE IN THE HOUSE

40
00:00:55,396 --> 00:00:55,863
MORE DIFFICULT.

41
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:58,733

00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:05,673
RESIGN, HE IS JIM COMEY’S BEST

00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:06,874
WITNESS ON THE OBSTRUCTION OF

46
00:01:06,874 --> 00:01:09,911
JUSTICE CHARGES BECAUSE HE WAS

47
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:11,613
THERE WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID

48
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:16,184
COME UP AND GIVE ME A BASIS TO

49
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:16,918
JUSTIFY FIRING COMEY.

50
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:18,186
HERE IS REALLY WHERE I WANT TO

51
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:18,620
DO IT.

52
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,390
NOW YOU MAKE IT LOOK KOSHER.

53
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,024
>> Harris: SO YOU’VE JUST

54
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:23,958
GIVEN US A POLITICAL SIDE AND I

55
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:27,329
ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER

56
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:28,029
THE PRESIDENT COULD FILL THIS

57
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:33,668
POSITION IF BY NOT RESIGNATION.

58
00:01:33,668 --> 00:01:34,836
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BY A

59
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:38,373
FEDERAL STATUTE MUST BE RUN BY A

60
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:38,373
FEDERAL STATUTE MUST BE RUN BY A

61
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:40,108
HUMAN BEING WHO IS CONCERNED BY

62
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:42,911
THE SENATE.

63
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:46,448
HE HAS REMOVED HIMSELF FROM THE

64
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:47,916
MUELLER PROBE SO THE PROBE MUST

65
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,384
BE RUN BY SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN

66
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:51,586
CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE.

67
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:52,287
IF HE LEAVES TODAY, THE NEXT

68
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:55,791
PERSON IN LINE IS FRANCISCO.

69
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,292
IF HE DOESN’T WANT TO DO THIS OR

70
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:57,292
IF HE DOESN’T WANT TO DO THIS OR

71
00:01:57,292 --> 00:02:00,629
CAN’T DO IT, THE NEXT PERSON IN

72
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:01,563
LINE, THERE’S NO ONE UP THERE

73
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:03,866
THAT I AM AWARE OF WHO HAS BEEN

74
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:05,601
CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE SO ONE

75
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:06,435
OF THE TWO OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO

76
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:06,435
OF THE TWO OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO

77
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:06,802
DO IT.

78
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:09,238
I DON’T THINK IT BRINGS ABOUT

79
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:09,937
ANY CHANGE IN THE MUELLER

80
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:14,009
INVESTIGATION AT OLD DUMB AT

81
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:14,276
ALL.

82
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:14,910
HE HAS PROFOUND LEGAL AND

83
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,114
ETHICAL OBLIGATIONS TO SEEK THE

84
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:21,117
EVIDENCE THAT HE HAS BEEN

85
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:22,451
CHARGED WITH SEEKING AND TO

86
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:23,452
PROSECUTE IF HE FEELS HE HAS A

87
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:27,323
STRONG ENOUGH CASE AND IF THERE

88
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:29,425
ARE NEW BOSSES INTERFERING WITH

89
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:29,725
THAT.

90
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:31,027
>> Harris: BEFORE I PASS THIS

91
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:33,229
ON QUICKLY, WHAT ABOUT THE NEW

92
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:35,264
DEPUTY AG THEN FIRING ROBERT

93
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:36,599
MUELLER?

94
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,366
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

95
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:37,700
>> YES.

96
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,238
OF THE PRESIDENT CAN FIRE -- CAN

97
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:42,238
OF THE PRESIDENT CAN FIRE -- CAN

98
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:43,539
INSTRUCT ROD ROSENSTEIN TO FIRE

99
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,607
BOB MUELLER AND THE PRESIDENT

100
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:46,075
CAN INSTRUCT THE NEW DEPUTY AG

101
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:49,412
TO FIRE BOB MUELLER.

102
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:51,014
THE PRESIDENT WILL EVENTUALLY

103
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:52,248
WANT HIS OWN DEPUTY AG.

104
00:02:52,248 --> 00:02:55,018
NO WAY THE SENATE IS GOING TO

105
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:56,052
CONFIRM THAT PERSON BETWEEN NOW

106
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,453
AND THE MIDTERMS, PROBABLY NOT

107
00:02:57,453 --> 00:02:58,655
GOING TO CONFIRM THAT PERSON

108
00:02:58,655 --> 00:03:00,924
BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEW SENATE

109
00:03:00,924 --> 00:03:02,292
COMING IN RIGHT AFTER THE FIRST

110
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:03,026
OF THE YEAR.

111
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:06,229
AND THEY MIGHT BE CONFIRMING TWO

112
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,229
AND THEY MIGHT BE CONFIRMING TWO

113
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,963
PEOPLE AND ATTORNEY GENERAL AS

114
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:08,431
WELL AS THE DEPUTY

115
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:10,433
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

116
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:11,568
>> Melissa: YOU SAY THE

117
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,837
PRESIDENT WANTS HIS OWN PERSON

118
00:03:13,837 --> 00:03:14,704
IN THERE AND DEPUTY AG BUT

119
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:17,774
TECHNICALLY, ROD ROSENSTEIN IS

120
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:20,777
HIS OWN PERSON.

121
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:21,978
BECAUSE JEFF SESSIONS PICKED HIM

122
00:03:21,978 --> 00:03:21,978
BECAUSE JEFF SESSIONS PICKED HIM

123
00:03:21,978 --> 00:03:23,013
WANTING SOMEBODY WHO WAS SORT OF

124
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:23,013
WANTING SOMEBODY WHO WAS SORT OF

125
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:24,714
A CAREER IN THE DEPARTMENT WHO

126
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:25,882
CAN KIND OF GIVE THEM THE INS

127
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:28,318
AND OUTS.

128
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:30,187
>> ALL OF THAT IS CORRECT.

129
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:31,655
THE PRESIDENT HAS THIS ATTITUDE

130
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:33,457
ABOUT LOYALTY BUT EVEN IF YOU

131
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:35,792
ARE MY PERSON, EVEN IF I MAJOR

132
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:40,597
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, EVEN IF I

133
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:41,265
DO, THE BEHAVIOR MANIFEST AS

134
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:43,233
LOYALTY AS I DEFINE IT, I DON’T

135
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:43,934
LIKE IT STAYING THERE BUT YOU

136
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:46,804
ARE QUITE CORRECT, THE PRESIDENT

137
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:46,804
ARE QUITE CORRECT, THE PRESIDENT

138
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:47,571
NOMINATED AS A SENATE CONFIRMED

139
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:50,441
ROD ROSENSTEIN.

140
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:51,141
JEFF SESSIONS SUGGESTED HIM

141
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:52,209
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN IN THE

142
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:54,445
SENATE FOR 24 YEARS EVEN THOUGH

143
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:55,746
HE’S A FORMER PROSECUTOR HIMSELF

144
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:55,746
HE’S A FORMER PROSECUTOR HIMSELF

145
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:59,283
AND HE NEEDED AN OLD HAND SO TO

146
00:03:59,283 --> 00:04:02,253
SPEAK TO BE HIS CHIEF OPERATING

147
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:02,953
OFFICER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:03,721
JUSTICE WHICH IS WHAT HE GOT IN

149
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,190
ROD ROSENSTEIN.

150
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,425
>> Christopher: LOOK LIKE I’M

151
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:08,159
MISSING SOME GREAT WEATHER BACK

152
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,029
IN D.C.

153
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:13,798
THIS GUY IS A ROCK-RIBBED

CONSERVATIVE, FEDERALIST SOCIETY

156
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,033
KIND OF GUY, IF HE WERE TO TAKE

157
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,736
OVER THIS JOB WERE THIS TO BE A

158
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:20,036
TRUE STORY, WERE HE TO BE

159
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:20,904
RECONFIRMED BY THE SENATE OR IS

160
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:22,573
HE ALREADY A POLITICAL APPOINTEE

161
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:22,573
HE ALREADY A POLITICAL APPOINTEE

162
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:26,444
AND IS ABLE TO DO THE JOB?

163
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:27,545
>> THAT’S A GOOD QUESTION,

164
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:28,046
THANK YOU FOR IT.

165
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:33,518

169
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:38,056
HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE

170
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:38,489
RECONFIRMED.
