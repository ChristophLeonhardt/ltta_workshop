1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,140
NORTH KOREA RECENTLY RELEASED AN
AMERICAN WHO WAS DETAINED IN THE

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,860
COUNTRY AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE
NOW FIND THAT AUTO WARM BEER HAS

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,440
A SEVERE BRAIN INJURY AND HAS
BEEN IN A COMA SINCE HIS

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,750
ARRIVAL TO THE UNITED STATES.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,110
DOCTORS CARING FOR THE RELEASED
NORTH KOREAN DETAINEE SAID

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:26,210
THAT HE IS NOT SPOKEN OR MOVED
ON HIS OWN SINCE HE ARRIVED

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,100
IN THE UNITED STATES ON TUESDAY,
A CONDITION THEY DESCRIBED

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,490
AS UNRESPONSIVE WAKEFULNESS OR
PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,490
VEGETATIVE STATE.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,040
HE ACTUALLY DID SUFFER FROM
EXTENSIVE LOSS OF BRAIN

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,760
TISSUE IN ALL REGIONS OF THE
BRAIN.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,139
HE DOES OPEN HIS EYES AND BLINKS
SPONTANEOUSLY BUT DOCTORS

13
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:43,909
SAY HE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF
UNDERSTANDING LANGUAGE OR

14
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:45,260
RESPONDING TO VERBAL COMMANDS.

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,600
HE'S IN BAD SHAPE.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,299
NORTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES SAY
WELL HE SUFFERED FROM

17
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:55,620
BOTULISM AND HE TOOK A SLEEPING
PILL AND THAT IS WHAT

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,209
CAUSED IT BUT OF COURSE THAT IS
NOT THE CASE.

19
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:06,710
THE DOCTORS IN THE UNITED STATES
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE.

20
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:13,049
, HERE'S A STATEMENT FROM ONE OF
THE DOCTORS IN THE US.

21
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:21,060
WITH NO CERTIFIABLE KNOWLEDGE OF
THE CAUSE OR CIRCUMSTANCES

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,759
OF HIS NEUROLOGICAL INJURIES
THAT THIS PATTERN OF BRAIN

23
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:27,869
INJURY IS USUALLY SEEN AS A
RESULT OF CARDIOPULMONARY

24
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,420
ARREST REPORTS APPLIED TO THE
BRAIN IS INADEQUATE FOR A P

25
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,290
TIME, RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF
BRAIN TISSUE.

26
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,049
HE WAS DETAINED AFTER
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE ALLEGEDLY

27
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:41,340
FOUND HIM TAKING DOWN SOME SORT
OF POSTER OR BANNER AND AT THAT

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:54,619
POINT, WHILE HE WAS ABOUT TO
LEAVE THE COUNTRY, IS GOING TO

29
00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:03,729
THE AIRPORT, HE WAS STOPPED AND
ARRESTED AND HE WAS ACCUSED

30
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:04,729
OF ESPIONAGE.

31
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:05,729
EXACTLY.

32
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,869
HE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF
COMMITTING A HOSTILE ACT AGAINST

33
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:11,519
THE COUNTRY AND SENTENCED TO 15
YEARS OF HARD LABOR.

34
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:18,890
HARD LABOR FOR THEM IS LEARNING
THE DANCE FROM THRILLER.

35
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,360
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN
THE VIDEOS.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,660
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THEM?

37
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,970
ON YOUTUBE, YOU'VE SEEN THEM?

38
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,810
WAIT YOU'RE BEING SERIOUS?

39
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,810
YES.

40
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,959
THAT IT WAS JUST A JAB AT
MICHAEL JACKSON I WAS LIKE DAMN.

41
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,780
THEY HAVE TO WHEN THE
CHOREOGRAPHY OF THRILLER

42
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,790
AND THEY VIDEOTAPE IT. IT IS ON
YOUTUBE.

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,470
NORTH KOREAN PRISONERS AND IF
THEY DON'T DO IT EXACTLY,

44
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,470
THEY GET IN TROUBLE.

45
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,470
IT'S SICK.

46
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,720
I WOULD SAY THAT MY FIRST
INSTINCT WAS THERE SOME TRICK

47
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,700
BEING PUSHED BUT
THAT'S NOT TRUE, BUT THIS IS KIM

48
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,209
JONG-UN, KIM JONG-IL CLAIMED
TO SHOOT A 39 ON EVERY GOLF

49
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:54,450
COURSE AND SAID HE NEVER BOWLED A
GAME LESS THAN 300.

50
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:02,900
YOU KNOW THE STORY OF HOW HE
WAS BORN?

51
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:17,110
I WENT TO THE DMZ LINE BECAUSE I
WAS ENTERTAIN TROOPS AND

52
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:46,730
THEY MAKE YOU WATCH A MOVIE
ABOUT HOW 

53
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,849
HE WAS BORN.

54
00:03:50,849 --> 00:04:06,610
HE FLEW OUT OF HIS MOTHER'S FOR
CHINA AND ASCENDED.

55
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,810
LITERALLY FLEW.

56
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:17,149
AND WHITE DOVE CAME OUT OF THERE
TOO.

57
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:20,519
HIS DAD LOVE MOVIES, BIG
MOVIE FAN WITH THE HUGE

58
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,519
MOVIE COLLECTION.

59
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,880
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
WESTERN MOVIES BUT HE

60
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,030
WANTED TO START THE NORTH KOREAN
FILM INDUSTRY.

61
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:39,070
IT'S NOT A SUPER ARTISTICALLY
CREATIVE COUNTRY AS YOU MIGHT

62
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,310
IMAGINE SO HE KIDNAPPED SOUTH
KOREA'S LEADING ACTRESS AND HER

63
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:59,340
HUSBAND, A DIRECTOR, THEY WERE
KIDNAPPED 

64
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,340
AND SPENT,

65
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,310
12 YEARS OR SO IN NORTH KOREA
MAKING MOVIES THERE AFTER

66
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,640
THEY'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED BEFORE
THEY ESCAPED AND GOT BACK

67
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:18,680
ACROSS SO HE IS 

68
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:31,050
A LUNATIC SO THE
NOTION THAT THEY WOULD MAKE

69
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:38,380
THE PRISONERS DANCE TO
THRILLER, AT FIRST I WAS LIKE

70
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,470
YOU BEEN TRICKED AND THEN I
WAS LIKE NO, WE'RE TALKING

71
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,780
ABOUT NORTH KOREA, THAT IS
PROBABLY TRUE.

72
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:56,340
I DON'T MEAN TO BLAME THE
VICTIM BUT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE

73
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:08,950
ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO
AVOID TRAVELING TO NORTH KOREA.

74
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:18,630
PLEASE DON'T DO IT.

75
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:35,150
I KNOW THERE'S A MARKET FOR
PEOPLE WHO 

76
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:48,150
LIKE 
TO GO TO

77
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:57,380
COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH KOREA.

78
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,170
THEY THINK IT IS ADVENTUROUS.

79
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,060
DON'T PUT YOUR LIFE AT RISK LIKE
THIS.

80
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,870
PLEASE, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

81
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:11,480
IT WAS UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.

82
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:18,490
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA IS

83
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,550
DOING. DON'T DO IT.

84
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,950
IT WAS GOING AROUND.

85
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:35,140
THEY SAY HE GOT BOTULISM TO GET
THE BRAIN INJURY.

86
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,470
HE DIDN'T.

87
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:50,470
THEY DID IT.

88
00:07:50,470 --> 00:08:09,200
THEY KNOCKED HIM OVER AND THEY
HIT HIS HEAD AND THEN THEY

89
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,190
FINALLY LET THEM GO.

90
00:08:11,190 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY PRAISE TRUMP FOR GETTING
THEIR SON OUT OF NORTH KOREA.
