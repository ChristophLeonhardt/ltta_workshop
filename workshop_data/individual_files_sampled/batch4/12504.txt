all righty so here we are on Facebook live Ben Shapiro show with Brian kill me Brian of course is the co-host of Fox and Friends not only most watched by far but the most powerful morning show in America and he's the author of a brand-new book Andrew Jackson and the miracle of New Orleans the battle that shaped America's destiny it's already on the bestseller list it is a terrific book I've read it and it's really interesting someone to bring Brian on for just a few minutes to talk about Brian thanks so much for joining us been more important thanks for having me on yeah absolutely so let's just jump right in the traditional talk about the Battle of New Orleans that it didn't even need to be fought in the first place I mean that's that's always the first question I'm sure you're asked is is that we already negotiated peace treaty with the British what would have happened if the Battle of New Orleans was never fought well not only is that question valid it was one of the reasons why I was leaning towards doing when I was going to do the war of 1812 was logical after Thomas Jefferson I was gonna say Battle of Baltimore at the time Ben you were talking about it we were debating the worthiness of the star-spangled banner' and I thought what a great news peg to put it with then upon further review I looked at both and I compared them and I said wait a second the battle and I with New Orleans not only had to be forwarded had to send a message to the rest of the world once we won that we're here to stay we can fight and we will win against the world's number one power especially the number one infantry and that is the British then we find documentation in England that revealed that the British planned on if they had to abrogating the Treaty of Ghent which was would enter the war and putting up an international case that Napoleon had no right to sell us Louisiana Purchase America would have looked a lot different once again we we start the war terribly we end up so strong even though technically a draw that the rest of the world knows we got to deal with this democracy and we cannot gonna be able to shut up the magnet which is attracting some of the best people in the world to our shores that's an amazing thing and in the battle itself is just an incredible story since we were vastly outgunned and energy Jackson really had to put together a bizarre coalition of people to fight in this battle in the first place can you talk a little bit about the the coalition they the army that Andrew Jackson brought to the battle purely Amer Arkan and especially as we debate immigration of this country as purely America means we're all mix races creeds and colors he he walks up with 1,400 militia members he's about to take on an army of at least 12,000 and he's got to get it together in three weeks what does he do well he has a so-called draft and he wants who's willing to fight anyone over 16 you're in actually 13 and then he could Choctaw Indians step up Cherokee and step up freemen of color grab guns treated equally on the battle lines and we know back then sadly that wasn't the case almost anywhere else in America and then stepping up our Pirates who knew what where the contraband was was able to deliver a gun power powder and Flint and also when able to knew the topography of their of the region and then comes Tennessee sharpshooters as well as Kentuckians who reports some without guns together they get about 5,000 militia members they meld together in three weeks and they do something Napoleon couldn't they take out the British infantry in under 45 minutes and they do it by building a mini wall another debatable topic they dig a moat almost like the the Romans and they say okay bring it on you got to get through us we gonna get to New Orleans and they couldn't it's an amazing amazing story and of course the person who led the battle was Andrew Jackson now Jackson has come in for a fair bit of fire obviously for his presidency and for his treatment of Native Americans and and on slavery from both left and right I mean they're folks like Dinesh D'Souza who are very critical of Andrew Jackson there's a lot of talk about taking Jackson off of off of our money what's he after writing the book what's your opinion on Jackson as a human being and you know can we separate out Jackson the Patriot and the fighter from Jackson the the so-called racist put it this way he was a person of his times I mean we you had nine of the first 12 presidents had slaves people back then had different sadly we wish they didn't but 200 plus years ago different visions of what equality is we've corrected that as George Bush has said and others have agreed it was America's original sin so Jackson was doing a lot of other people are doing number one number two no one doubts that he's an impactful person no one doubts that he changed America and his impact went beyond just the eight years he was in office you know that he he mentored martin van buren who succeeded him and he ended up being very tight with john tyler who followed him after william henry harrison had won the election and not like jackson so he made a tremendous impact in his time you have to see the tributes upon his death of all sight of all sides who said this is the every man born against impossible odds in the backwoods of the tennessee region who with without parents or brothers wiped out an orphan at 13 and rose up to be a two-term president my goodness this is a story to study not as if he is the Messiah but is he an impactful America that helps shape where our country is I don't didn't want to do and nor am i capable of doing the definitive biography you are Ben and Jon Meacham did and there are so many out there I wanted to grab one battle I wanted to find out why this unknown became the most famous man in America and everyone wanted a piece of him he represented you don't have to know anybody here you just had the will to pursue happiness and success and that a lot of people got inspiration from what he did he wasn't connected to Virginia Washington Philadelphia New York or Massachusetts this guy did it on his own with no connections if he had connections they were all dead before he was even 15 years old no the book is Andrew Jackson the miracle of New Orleans the author of course is Brian Kilmeade so Brian one of the big reasons they Andrew Jackson has come up so much lately is because of course the the current presidents of the United States President Trump likes to cite Andrew Jackson as a sort of inspiration for him when a populist front in the book you talk about the fact that because Andrew Jackson was a sort of backwoods character that he didn't have all of these hoity-toity connections has actually created some serious obstacles for him even in terms of how he constructed his army and and his the respect that he got is general I could talk a little bit about that well I mean for one thing he always felt he had to prove himself and he was also told I haven't committed to memory but his mom basically said don't suit for slander settle score yourself and make that don't use anything as an excuse he did that his entire life so the point we had a series of duels in fact before the Battle of New Orleans you know he had a bullet numb he was constantly taking people on but he had this quality been is it he wouldn't take on people that he over Matt he always stuck up for the little guy and people that were under mapped without connections that's why people resonated with him so I also think there's something else about very similar to the current President and that when the when Washington rejected President Trump he took his case to the people the crowds grew and the message worked the first one to do that was Andrew Jackson he won and said this is my story this is what I'm gonna do and in the beginning like Trump no one took him serious they didn't think he was worthy like Trump he also could not stand the press especially the negative press but he went too for step further he would keep the articles that he didn't like make notes in the margin so when he ran across that reporter he would make them justify their words and their their angry words about him or his policies tremendous people I mean a tremendous grassroots story but a guy that could not turn away from a fight now Ben I'll give you only three seconds to tell you who that reminds you of Ben - that's right on the money all right so the book is Andrew Jackson the miracle of New Orleans the battle that shaped America's destiny - the author of course the Brian Kilmeade Brian thanks so much for joining us everybody can go get this at amazon.com or Barnes and Noble it's at your local
