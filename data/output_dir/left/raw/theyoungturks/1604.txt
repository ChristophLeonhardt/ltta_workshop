1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,070
RAPPER T.I.

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,760
HAS BEEN ARRESTED
IN ATLANTA WHERE AT LEAST IT

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,700
COUNTRY CLUB COMMUNITY
THAT HE LIVES IN.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,070
THIS WAS IN HENRY COUNTY
TO BE EXACT.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,160
POLICE NOT ONLY ARRESTED HIM, HE
WAS CHARGED WITH A NUMBER OF

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,369
MISDEMEANORS INCLUDING
DISORDERLY CONDUCT, AND SIMPLE

7
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:20,720
ASSAULT.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,990
WHAT DID YOU DO EXACTLY?

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,980
IT
TURNS OUT HE ATTEMPTED TO

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,900
REENTER THE GATED COMMUNITY HE

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:35,610
LIVES IN WHILE HE WAS DRUNK.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,059
HE APPARENTLY DID NOT HAVE A KEY
TO GET BACK INTO THE GATES AND

13
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,670
HE TRIED COMMUNICATING WITH A
SECURITY GUARD WHO WAS THERE.

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,789
HIS LAWYER SAYS THE SECURITY
GUARD WAS ASLEEP AND IT WAS HARD

15
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:54,770
TO GET HIM TO WAKE UP BUT A
VERBAL ALTERCATION ENSUED.

16
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,109
WE DON'T HAVE VERY MANY DETAILS
AS TO WHAT WAS SAID BUT

17
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:01,809
NONETHELESS LET ME GIVE YOU THE
DETAILS THAT WE HAVE AT THIS

18
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:26,180
MOMENT.

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,560
AT SOME POINT THEY ACTUALLY
CALLED T.I.'S WIFE'S TO CONFIRM

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,119
THAT HE DOES IN FACT LIVE IN

21
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,360
THIS GATED COMMUNITY AND SHE DID
CONFIRM IT AND SAID LET HIM AND

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,390
IMMEDIATELY AT THE GUARD
REFUSED TO DO SO.

23
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,520
POLICE WERE CALLED AND HE
WAS ARRESTED.

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,649
>> I READ THE HEADLINE AND
THOUGHT THIS DEPENDS AND I

25
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,369
WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT
DEPENDS ON.

26
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:57,240
IF YOU ARE GOING INTO YOUR OWN
GATED COMMUNITY, IT DEPENDS

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,740
NUMBER ONE, IF YOU HAVE A KEY ñ
IF THE GUARD DOESN'T LET YOU

28
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,149
WHEN IT IS TOTALLY WRONG AND
IT IS OUTRAGEOUS.

29
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:06,970
IN THIS CASE HE DIDN'T
HAVE A KEY.

30
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:13,640
NOW WANT TO POINT NUMBER TWO,
CAN HE CALL SOMEONE INSIDE THE

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,520
HOUSE TO LET HIM IN?

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,970
IF HE
DOESN'T THEN THERE IS NO ONE TO

33
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,050
VOUCH THAT HE IS ACTUALLY T.I.
AND

34
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,520
LIVES THERE.

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,670
WELL THEN THE GUARD IS RIGHT.

36
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:33,850
IT IS HIS JOB TO NOT LET HIM
UNLESS HE HAS EVIDENCE OF THAT.

37
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,010
BUT IN THIS CASE HE DID CALL THE
HOUSE AND THE HOUSE SAID THAT

38
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,700
IS MY HUSBAND, LET HIM IN.

39
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,500
SO WHY WOULD YOU NOT LET HIM IN?

40
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,670
IT MIGHT BE THAT THE WHOLE

41
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,160
DISCUSSION ABOUT WAKING UP THE

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,770
GUARD MIGHT BE A REFERENCE TO
THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF THAT IT

43
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,360
CAUGHT FEELINGS ON BOTH SIDES?

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
>>I DON'T KNOW.

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,501
>> I DON'T KNOW IF RACE PLAYS A
ROLE, I DON'T KNOW THE RACE OF

46
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:13,130
THE SECURITY GUARD BUT IT IS
HARD NOT TO THINK THAT IT DOES.

47
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,660
THAT IF THERE IS A GATED
COMMUNITY WHERE A WHITE PERSON

48
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,820
COMES AND SAYS CALL MY WIFE NO
MATTER HOW DRUNK THE PERSON IS ñ

49
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,990
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE

50
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,580
DONE THAT?

51
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,731
IF THE GUARD DOESN'T
LET HIM IN ñ THAT IS NOT TO BE A

52
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:35,240
MINUSCULE PERCENTAGE OF THE
INSTANCES.

53
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,650
>> FOR ME THINGS STARTED TO TAKE
AN EXTREMELY NEGATIVE TERM

54
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,280
WHEN THEY CALLED HIS WIFE AND
SHE CONFIRMED THAT HE LIVED

55
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,980
THERE AND THEY STILL WOULDN'T
LET HIM IN.

56
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,900
AT THAT POINT THEY LOST ME.

57
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,210
YOU'RE RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE
EVIDENCE OF WHAT WAS SAID OR HOW

58
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,120
THIS PLAYED A ROLE.

59
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,340
THE SIMPLE ASSAULT MISDEMEANOR?

60
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,420
WHY?

61
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,230
BUT I WILL SAY THIS, AT THE

62
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,480
POINT WHERE IT HAS BEEN
CONFIRMED THAT I LIVE IN THIS

63
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,810
COMMUNITY AND YOU ARE DENYING ME

64
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,340
ENTRY TO MY OWN PROPERTY THAT IS
WHEN I GET EXTREMELY ANGRY AND

65
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,340
UPSET.

66
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,950
YOU ARE RIGHT IN SAYING WE DON'T
KNOW IF RACE PLAYS A ROLE BUT

67
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,200
HERE IS WHAT I DO KNOW, I DO
KNOW THAT LIVING IN ANY

68
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,640
SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TO DEAL
WITH GATEKEEPERS, A HOMEOWNERS

69
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,350
ASSOCIATION OR ANY TYPE OF GATED

70
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:32,070
COMMUNITY, IT IS THE WORST
SITUATION, DO NOT GET YOURSELF

71
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,670
INVOLVED BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE UP

72
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,460
YOUR BUTT CONSTANTLY.

73
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,630
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR RACE
IS THAT THE PEOPLE LIVING IN

74
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,320
THE SAME AREA QUESTION EVERYONE
AND HARASS EVERYONE.

75
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,910
THEY ARE INCREDIBLY
OVERWHELMINGLY UNBEARABLE.

76
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,870
I KNOW IT SEEMS GREAT TO LIVE IN
A GATED COMMUNITY OR H AWAY

77
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,283
SITUATION, JUST DON'T BECAUSE
THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO

78
00:04:58,283 --> 00:05:03,639
HAVE TO DEAL WITH REGULARLY.

79
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,040
>> IF YOU ARE T.I. AND YOU HAVE
SEEN THE NEWS LATELY WHERE A

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,420
WOMAN GOING TO GAIL'S QUESTION

81
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,320
FOR SLEEPING IN THE DORM THAT
SHE IS IN AT YALE.

82
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,650
THERE ARE GUYS GETTING KICKED
OUT OF THE STARBUCKS, THEY ARE

83
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,990
AFRICAN-AMERICAN ñ THE LIST GOES

84
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,570
ON AND ON.

85
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,930
SO NOW HE LIVES THERE AND HE HAS
MADE A LOT OF MONEY AND HE HAS A

86
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,120
REALLY NICE HOUSE IN THE CALL

87
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,230
HIS WIFE AND SHE CONFIRMS THAT
HE LIVES THERE AND THE GUARD

88
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,460
STILL SAYS NO, I THINK HE GETS

89
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,700
TO BE SUPER FRUSTRATED AND ALSO
GETS TO WONDER IF IT MIGHT BE

90
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,700
ABOUT RACE.

91
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,420
>>BY THE WAY LET ME BE CLEAR OF
COURSE THAT IS A POTENTIAL

92
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,060
FACTOR AND OF COURSE HE GETS
TO WONDER ABOUT IT.

93
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,440
I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I
AM NOT TRYING TO BLAME HIM FOR

94
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,890
BEING IN A GATED COMMUNITY.

95
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,630
I'M JUST SAYING PROPERTY OWNERS
OR PEOPLE IN ANY GIVEN

96
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,900
NEIGHBORHOOD GET INSANE WHEN IT
COMES TO KEEPING THE

97
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,020
NEIGHBORHOOD SAFE OR WHATEVER.

98
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,620
IT GETS WORSE WHEN YOU ARE IN A
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION TYPE

99
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,380
ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE HAVE
THE JUSTIFICATION TO CONSTANTLY

100
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:25,350
HARASS YOU.

101
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:35,540
>> LASTLY AND MAY BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT ñ PEOPLE CAUGHT

102
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:42,370
FEELINGS.

103
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,990
THE COPS, WHEN YOU SHOW UP YOU
ARE SUPPOSED TO SAY HEY DOES HE

104
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,520
BELONG HERE OR NOT?

105
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,940
DID YOU CALL THE HOUSE?

106
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,940
YES.

107
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,150
TO THE HOUSE SAY TO LET HIM IN?

108
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,150
YES.

109
00:06:53,150 --> 00:07:04,670
THEN WE ARE DONE WITH IT.

110
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,710
BUT INSTEAD YOU DEFY ANY KIND OF
AUTHORITY EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE

111
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:17,520
TOTALLY LOGICALLY CORRECT.

112
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,770
AND INSTEAD BECAUSE YOU DEFIED A
SECURITY GUARD WE ARE GOING TO

113
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,770
ARREST YOU AND DO THIS LAUNDRY

114
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,340
LIST OF CHARGES.

115
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,340
IF T.I.

116
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,780
WAS UPSET AND HE WAS
YELLING I GUARANTEE YOU THE COPS

117
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,900
WERE LIKE HOW DARE YOU.

118
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,050
BUT THINK ABOUT WHY IS HE UPSET?

119
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,130
IS THERE A CHANCE THAT HE IS

120
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,130
RIGHT?

121
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,980
DID THAT EVER OCCUR TO YOU?

122
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,900
