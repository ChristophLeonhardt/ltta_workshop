1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,850
TAYLOR SWIFT DROPPED HER
NEW ERA LAST NIGHT.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,759
SHE RELEASED HER NEW SINGLE,
LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,960
AND ANNOUNCED HER NEW
ALBUM REPUTATION.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,620
ALONG WITH ALL OF THIS SHE
ANNOUNCED A NEW AND UNIQUE

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,299
MARKETING CAMPAIGN TO SELL
TICKETS TO HER FANS BUT

6
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:17,010
SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS IS A
LITTLE BIT SHADY, A LITTLE

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:38,660
SLITHERY IF YOU WILL.

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:58,330
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE.

9
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,350
OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO, ALL
THESE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO

10
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,190
BOOST, YOU CAN BUY THE ALBUM
BUT YOU CAN ALSO BUY FROM

11
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,790
DIFFERENT RETAILERS.

12
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,170
YOU CAN BUY IT FROM ALWAYS
DIFFERENT PLACES LIKE LOCAL

13
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,890
RECORD STORE, THAT WILL ALL
SERVE TO BOOSTER STATUS AND

14
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,420
YOU CAN ALSO SHARE THINGS
ABOUT THE ALBUM, SHARE VOTER

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,789
PHOTOS, ONE PER PLATFORM PER DAY
AND IF YOU LIKE TO SEE MY

16
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:21,630
FRIEND ON FACEBOOK, YOU BETTER
DO IT ONCE AND NEVER AGAIN

17
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,909
BECAUSE I AM AWARE.

18
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:24,890
WE ALL ARE AWARE THAT ALYSSA
DOES COMING OUT WITH

19
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:25,890
SOMETHING NEW.

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,119
IF YOU WANT TO BE MY FRIEND YOU
DO IT ONCE EVERY FEW MINUTES.

21
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:51,979
IF YOU WANT TO GET A HIGH BOOST
THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

22
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,389
THIS WILL TELL YOU ON THE SCREEN
YOU ARE GOING TO BE ON A

23
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:57,399
WAIT LIST AND IT WILL TELL YOU
IF YOU ARE A PRIORITY OR

24
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:59,009
TOWARD THE END OF THAT.

25
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,799
ALSO WHAT IS WORTH NOTING THAT
PARTICIPATION DOES NOT GUARANTEE

26
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:12,870
ACCESS TO PURCHASE TICKETS OR
THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE TICKETS.

27
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,500
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME
ARTISTS HAVE DONE THINGS TO

28
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,140
TRY TO MAKE SURE FANS ARE
GETTING TICKETS TO THE SHOW.

29
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,150
BROOM FOR SPRING STEAM AND EVEN
HANDLE SENT HAS ROLLED OUT

30
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,659
THE SAME THING.

31
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:28,540
HOW TAYLOR SWIFT IS UNIQUE AND
HOW SHE IS ROLLING THIS OUT

32
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:37,019
IS IN INCORPORATING THE MORE YOU
BUY, THE HIGHER YOU GET.

33
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,019
BUT NOT REALLY.

34
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:39,599
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW.

35
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,879
I WANT TO GET A
REACTION FROM YOU ALL.

36
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,120
I HAVE SOME FEELINGS ABOUT THIS
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,469
HOW YOU ARE FEELING ABOUT IT
1ST.

38
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:50,550
I AM JUST SO HAPPY THAT THERE IS
MORE TAYLOR SWIFT MUSIC COMING.

39
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,629
AT LIKE 130 IN THE MORNING I WAS
LISTENING TO LOOK WHAT YOU

40
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:59,459
MADE ME DO AND I WAS SO HAPPY.

41
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,230
I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH
THE IDEA.

42
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,150
WAS NOT IDLE HAVE ANY PROBLEM,
THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY.

43
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,069
THE GAME OF FINDING AND
REWARDING PEOPLE WHO HAVE

44
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:14,450
MORE MONEY TO SPEND, THEY SPEND
MORE MONEY ON TAYLOR SWEAT

45
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,540
WITH PRIORITY IN MIND BUT THE
THING IS, THEY ARE ADDING

46
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,410
LEVELS OF PRIORITY WHICH
ESSENTIALLY MAKES ME THINK

47
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,200
IT'S LIKE BUYING AIRPLANE
TICKETS.

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,220
THEY ARE BECOMING MORE LIKE THE
AIRLINES AND WE KNOW HOW

49
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,980
MUCH EVERYBODY LOVES
THE AIRLINES.

50
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,489
THAT IS WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE TO MEET THE

51
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:34,299
IS THE PROMISE OF EXCLUSIVITY
THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY DELIVER

52
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:40,049
ON ANY KIND OF PRIORITY WHICH IS
PROBLEMATIC AND ALSO POSTING,

53
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,810
NOT FORCING BUT INVITING HER
FANS TO DO PROMOTIONS FOR HER.

54
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,370
YOU HAVE MONEY FOR A PROMO TEAM
THAT I NEED TO SHARE YOUR

55
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,959
ALBUM HER STORY AND LISTEN 12.

56
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,040
NOT AS A MECHANISM FOR
PURCHASING TICKETS.

57
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
ALSO TO COME SEE YOU.

58
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,069
YOU KNOW, I FELT THE REMEDY
FOR THIS IS PATIENCE.

59
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,249
I WILL GET TRAVEL WHEN I CAN GET
IN THE STORE WHEN ITUNES HAS A

60
00:03:58,249 --> 00:04:02,400
OR WHEN I CAN GO PICK UP A
TICKET.

61
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,310
TOO MANY TAYLOR SWIFT ALBUMS?

62
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,160
NOTE.

63
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,900
I AM A BLACK WOMAN.

64
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,230
I AM NOT ñ

65
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,410
AND I AM A WHITE GIRL IN 2015.

66
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,810
THAT IS PARTICULAR
TO TAYLOR SWIFT.

67
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,600
THERE ARE SOME OTHERS I WILL
MESS WITH BUT THIS ONE IN

68
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,070
PARTICULAR THAT I AM NOT JUMPING
THROUGH ALL THESE ECSTASY

69
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,640
TAYLOR SWIFT.

70
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:39,260
I THINK THIS WILL ALLOW IS
NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT.

71
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,300
YOU CAN JUST WHAT WERE THE
RICHEST KIDS AND I FEEL

72
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,380
LIKE THIS WITH THE ROOM, THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE MOST D

73
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,980
JUST SPENT ALL THIS STUFF
BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO

74
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,640
HAVE THESE PEOPLE WANT
TO PLAY THE GAME.

75
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,900
YOU ARE TURNING YOUR FANS INTO A
GAME THING DIORAMAS EVEN

76
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,330
EPISODE OF BLACK MAYOR WITH
ACTOR FROM GET OUT HAS TO

77
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,990
BIKE ON THE STATIONARY BIKE AND
THE MORE POINTS HE GETS,

78
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,810
SOMEONE IN THE COMMENTS WILL
HOPEFULLY GET THIS BECAUSE I'M

79
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,810
CRAZY, THE MORE POINTS HE GETS
HE CAN AUDITION FOR THE SHOW.

80
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,400
IS A RICK AND MORTY EPISODE
THAT DIFFERENT WORLD WITHIN

81
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,580
A WORLD JUST TO CREATE POWER
FOR THE WORLD ABOVE IT.

82
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,390
SIMILAR TO THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

83
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,870
IT DOES SAY IN TAYLOR'S
DEFENSE, WHICH I DON'T REALLY

84
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,470
CARE, BUT IN TAYLOR'S DEFENSE,
YOU ARE ALLOWED TO POST

85
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,220
PHOTOS AND ENGAGE IN SOCIAL
MEDIA WHICH SEEM LIKE

86
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,710
NONMONETARY WAYS TO PARTICIPATE
IN UP YOUR STATUS IN MY.

87
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,240
ABSOLUTELY, BUT THE HIGHEST
BOOST ISN'T BUYING HER

88
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,610
MERGE, SNAKE RINGS AND ONE OF
THEM GOES FOR 60 BUCKS.

89
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,220
IF YOU WANT A CHEAP TICKET
TO A CONCERT, BY THE NINE

90
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,780
DOLLAR TICKETS TO THE KIDNEY
PERIOD TOP CONCERTS BECAUSE

91
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,462
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE
SELLING RIGHT NOW.

92
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:52,810
REMEMBER THE TITLE IS SAID YOU
CAN BUY KATIE TO GIVE A

93
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,550
LESSON ABOUT OF TAMPONS.

94
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,030
NOT THE GOOD TAMPONS THAT
THE COTTON.

95
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,830
NO CHLORINE.

96
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,810
ARGUMENT HERE IS A PUSSY WHAT
WEÖ I WOULD ALWAYS TICKETS

97
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,870
GET BUT UP AND THEN YOU HAVE
TO BUY A TICKET FOR AN

98
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,800
ASTRONOMICAL PRICE.

99
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,690
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SYSTEM IN
PLACE FOR BOB, BUT DON'T

100
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,900
PUT THAT ON YOUR FANS.

101
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,050
SOLVE IT WITHOUT GETTING Ä15

102
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,560
INVOLVED IN SPENDING THEIR
ALLOWANCE ON THIS.

103
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,140
IT IS NOT THEIR JOB, IT IS
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS THE

104
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,110
PERSON THEY'RE GOING TO SAY TO
MAKE SURE THEY CAN AFTER

105
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,780
ACCESS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
TO GO TO YOUR CONCERT.

106
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,310
WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS BOARDROOM
AND THERE LIKE PEOPLE WILL

107
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,580
LOVE THIS.

108
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,370
WHAT HAPPENED?

109
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,740
SO RICH PEOPLE.

110
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,560
THERE WASN'T ONE PERSON WHO
WORKED A RETAIL JOB HE WAS

111
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,020
LIKE YEAH, REAL QUICK,
SCRIBBLING HERE, PEOPLE ARE

112
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,550
NOT GOING TO LOVE TO SHELL OUT
CASH ON MULTIPLE ALBUMS.

113
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,890
THERE SOMEONE WHO WORKED
RETAIL WAS LIKE WHAT IF I PAY

114
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,610
MORE FOR NOTHING?

115
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,050
FOR NO GUARANTEED REWARD.

116
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,390
DOESN'T DO A THING FOR ME?

117
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,550
WHAT IF I PAY MORE FOR NOTHING.

118
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,390
THAT'S GREAT, BUT THAT ON ALBUM.

119
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,390
REPUTATION.

120
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,970
YOU ARE RIGHT THAT IT DOES
NOT ACCOMPLISH THE STATED GOAL.

121
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,690
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A BOTS
YOU WOULD USE A DIFFERENT

122
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,770
SYSTEM.

123
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:20,920
IT'S THE DISINGENUOUS NATURE OF
THIS POLICY THAT IS FRUSTRATING.

124
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,190
AND THEN THEY RELEASED A
VIDEO AND IT IS VERY MUCH

125
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,150
LOOKING FOR A PADDING
ON THE BACK.

126
00:07:27,150 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU, THE FANS.
