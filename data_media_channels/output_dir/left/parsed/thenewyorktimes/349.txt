“The motion is adopted.
Without objection, the motion 
to reconsider is laid on the table.”
Here we are again.
Partisan political bickering
has led to another
government shutdown.
But what does that mean?
The federal fiscal year
starts on Oct. 1,
often without new
spending laws in place.
Instead, the
president and Congress
strike a short-term deal
to buy more time.
If they can’t reach
a new agreement
before the next deadline,
much of the 
federal government shuts down.
Since October, 
there have already been
three short-term agreements.
When the government shuts down,
federal workers are either
forced off the job
or told to work without pay.
Essential services,
such as airport security
and food inspections, 
stay in place.
The military remains active
but may not be paid on time,
depending on how long 
the shutdown drags on.
And national parks and
monuments will remain open,
at least this time.
In the event of a
shutdown,
the I.R.S. will likely
be forced to slow
implementation of 
the new tax bill.
Funding for Puerto Rico,
still rebuilding from Hurricane Maria,
also hangs in the balance.
The future will remain
unclear for DACA recipients.
And without an extension, 
the Children’s Health Insurance Program
will run out of money.
