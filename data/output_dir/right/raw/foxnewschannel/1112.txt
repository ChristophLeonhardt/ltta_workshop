00:00:11,597 --> 00:00:12,364
ELECTION RESULTS ACROSS COUNTRY,

3
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:14,033
THIS COULD BE A VERY TOUGH FALL

4
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:16,802
FOR IT REPUBLICANS.

5
00:00:16,802 --> 00:00:18,270
THIS YEAR IT COULD BE WORSE THAN

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,005
USUAL FOR A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT

7
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,840
REASONS, BUT ONE OF THOSE

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,775
REASONS MAY BE AT THE

9
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:24,410
REPUBLICANS ARE RUNNING ON

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,579
ENTIRELY THE WRONG ISSUES.

11
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:27,179
YOUR AVERAGE REPUBLICAN

12
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:27,913
OFFICEHOLDERS SEEMS TO BELIEVE

13
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:31,016
THAT MOST AMERICANS LOVE MASS

14
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:31,417
IMMIGRATION.

15
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:32,785
THEY SAY THAT ALL THE TIME.

16
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:35,254
IT TURNS OUT, IT'S NOT TRUE.

17
00:00:35,254 --> 00:00:37,489
BIG REPUBLICAN DONORS LOVE NEST

18
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:40,426
IMMIGRATION, AND SO TO

19
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:41,794
CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS, IT

20
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:44,763
INCREASES THE SIZE OF THEIR

21
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:45,798
PARTY.

22
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:48,601
CONSIDER THE NEW CVS U GOD OF

23
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:48,901
POLE.

24
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:54,239
FAR MORE IMMIGRATION THINKS IT'S

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,975
MAKING IMMIGRATION WORSE AND NOT

26
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:57,409
BETTER.

27
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:58,811
45% OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN SAY

28
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:00,980
IMMIGRATION IS HURTING THEM AND

29
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,615
ONLY 17% SAY HE IS HELPING.

30
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:05,584
HOW ABOUT HISPANICS, WHERE ARE

31
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:06,585
THEY ON THIS?

32
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:07,820
REPUBLICAN CONSULTANTS TELL YOU

33
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,021
AND THEY TELL THEIR CANDIDATES

34
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:12,024
NEVER TO SAY A NEGATIVE WORD

35
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:14,760
ABOUT IMMIGRATION FOR FEAR OF

36
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,995
ALIENATING HISPANIC VOTERS.

37
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:17,596
TURNS OUT THAT'S IDIOTIC AND

38
00:01:17,596 --> 00:01:19,198
PATRONIZING AND ACTUALLY 44% OF

39
00:01:19,198 --> 00:01:21,333
HISPANIC VOTERS SAY IMMIGRATION

40
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,503
IS HURTING THEIR COMMUNITIES.

41
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:25,604
JUST 28% SAY HE IS IMPROVING

42
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:25,938
THINGS.

43
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:28,007
THE NUMBERS COULD NOT BE MORE

44
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:28,574
CLEAR.

45
00:01:28,574 --> 00:01:29,875
IMMIGRATION IS A POWERFUL ISSUE

46
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,277
FOR AMERICANS OF ALL KINDS, AND

47
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:33,212
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT REPUBLICANS

48
00:01:33,212 --> 00:01:34,480
CAN WIN ON IF ONLY THEY WERE

49
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,482
BRAVE ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO

50
00:01:36,482 --> 00:01:36,849
VOTERS.

51
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:39,351
BUT, THEY ARE NOT.

52
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:41,987
AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF OF TOTAL

53
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:43,155
CONTROL OF CONGRESS, NO WALL IS

54
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:46,592
BEING BUILT, CITIES ARE BEING

55
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:47,760
WELL FUNDED, CHAIN MIGRATION IS

56
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,227
ALIVE AND WELL.

57
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:50,562
NOTHING IS HAPPENING.

58
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:51,263
NOW THAT THE MEDIA IS TELLING

59
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:54,033
YOU IT'S IMMORAL TO SEPARATE

60
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,802
IMMIGRANT PARENTS WITH THEIR

61
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:58,137
CHILDREN, LOTS OF REPUBLICANS

62
00:01:58,137 --> 00:01:58,637
BELIEVE THAT.

63
00:01:58,637 --> 00:02:00,639
BUT WAIT AMERICANS WHO GET

64
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:02,174
ARRESTED ARE SEPARATED FROM

65
00:02:02,174 --> 00:02:03,342
THEIR CHILDREN.

66
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:04,410
AMERICAN CITIZEN SHOULD BE

67
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,811
TREATED MORE HARSHLY THAN

68
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:06,812
ILLEGAL ALIENS?

69
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,213
HOW IS THAT?

70
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:09,715
HERE'S THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON

71
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:10,115
THE SUBJECT.

72
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:11,450
WATCH THIS.

73
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,386
>> WE BELIEVE EVERY PERSON WHO

74
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:17,790
ENTERS THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY

75
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,727
LIKE THAT SHOULD BE PROSECUTED

76
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:24,930
AND YOU CAN'T GIVE THE

77
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,265
NEIGHBORHOOD TO PEOPLE WHO ARE

78
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:28,033
BRINGING CHILDREN WITH THEM.

79
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:29,268
IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE

80
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:30,936
SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN,

81
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:33,205
THEY SHOULD NOT BRING THEM WITH

82
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:33,806
THEM.

83
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:35,207

SESSIONS CRITICIZE A LOT FOR A

85
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:37,309
BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT

86
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:38,444
WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT

87
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:40,612
ON THIS ISSUE, HE IS THE ONLY

88
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:42,414
PERSON IN WASHINGTON WERE STILL

00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:43,415
ARGUING THAT BORDERS AND LAWS

90
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:43,749
MATTER.

TO BE THE REST OF THIS PARTY

92
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:48,821
WILL WAKE UP AND REALIZE THEY

93
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:49,621
DO.

LOU DOBBS JOINS US TONIGHT.

95
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:52,424
YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ISSUE

96
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:53,525
MORE DEEPLY THAN ALMOST ANYBODY

97
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:54,426
I KNOW.

98
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:55,461
DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU THAT NO

99
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:57,663
ONE HAS PAUSE TO ASK, WAIT A

100
00:02:57,663 --> 00:02:58,831
SECOND, IF IT'S WRONG FOR

101
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:00,265
ILLEGAL ALIENS TO BE SEPARATED

102
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:02,267
FROM THE KIDS WHEN THEY COMMIT A

103
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:04,470
CRIME, WHY IS IT NOT WRONG FOR

104
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,804
AMERICAN CITIZENS TO BE

105
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:07,740
SEPARATED FROM THEIR KIDS?

106
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,475
>> THERE ARE PREDICTIVE GROUPS

107
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:10,776
IN THE UNITED STATES BUT WHEN IT

108
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:12,745
COMES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS,

109
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:14,379
THEY ARE A PREFERRED GROUP.

110
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,949
IT IS SO BECAUSE THE

111
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:19,451
ESTABLISHMENT, THE BUSINESS

112
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:20,185
ROUNDTABLE, CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,

U.S. MULTINATIONALS, THEY WANT

114
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,522
CHEAPER LABOR, THEY WANT OPEN

115
00:03:23,522 --> 00:03:25,858
BORDERS AND THEY WANT TO QUOTE

116
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:27,259
UNQUOTE HARMONIZE THOSE BORDERS.

117
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:30,028
YOU DON'T HEAR MUCH ABOUT THE

00:03:30,028 --> 00:03:31,530
NORTH AMERICAN UNION ANYMORE,

119
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,465
BUT UNDER GEORGE BUSH AND

120
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:36,535
THROUGH MOST OF THE OBAMA

00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:40,773
BRINGING CANADA AND MEXICO

TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED STATES,

125
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:44,543
WAS THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL.

126
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:45,677
THEY JUST HAD TO BACK OFF

127
00:03:45,677 --> 00:03:47,212
BECAUSE OF THE NUMBERS THAT YOU

128
00:03:47,212 --> 00:03:49,014
JUST SHOWED IN THAT POLL.

129
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:51,016
THE REALITY IS, AMERICANS

130
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:53,218
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING.

131
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:55,921
WHATEVER THE RACE, WHATEVER THE,

00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:57,790
WHATEVER THE SOCIOECONOMIC

NUMBERS, AMERICANS KNOW WHEN

135
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,661
THEY ARE BEING LIED TO AND THEY

136
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:03,929
CAN FEEL THE REALITY.

137
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:05,664
THE REALITY IS THAT WE DON'T

138
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:08,400
HAVE BORDERS BECAUSE WE IN THE

139
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,202
LAST MONTH JUST RETURNED TO THE

HIGHEST LEVELS OF ILLEGAL

BORDERS.

143
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:14,640
>> Tucker: IT SO INTERESTING

144
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,809
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS,

145
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:18,142
DEMOCRATS WILL TELL YOU, THE

146
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:18,976
MEDIA TELLS YOU AND A LOT OF

147
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:20,512
REPUBLICANS TELL YOU THAT PEOPLE

148
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:21,512
DON'T LIKE IMMIGRATION BECAUSE

149
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:24,383
THEY ARE RACIST, THEY ARE

150
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:24,716
BIGOTS.

151
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:26,485
LESS THAN 20% OF

AFRICAN-AMERICAN SAY IMMIGRATION

153
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:28,754
HAS MADE THEIR COMMUNITIES

BETTER.

155
00:04:29,188 --> 00:04:31,223
THEY ARE NOT FORWARDED.

156
00:04:31,223 --> 00:04:33,625
HISPANIC AMERICANS, SAME THING.

157
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,228
SO, IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT

158
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:37,963
BIGOTRY, ACTUALLY.

159
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:41,033
BECAUSE THIS CUTS ACROSS RACES.

160
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:42,234
>> ABSOLUTELY.

161
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:43,435

WING AND ESTABLISHMENT ARGUMENT

163
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,672

REALITY.

165
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,777
THE REALITY IS, AND ALL OF THOSE

166
00:04:51,777 --> 00:04:54,179
ETHNOCENTRIC INTEREST GROUPS AND

167
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,113
ACTIVIST GROUPS ARE BASICALLY

SPEWING PROPAGANDA.

169
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:58,383
THEY HAVE -- IT'S ALL BEEN

00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,118
PICKED UP BY THE NATIONAL

OBVIOUSLY, TO THE DETRIMENT OF

BORDER AS THE PRESIDENT IS MADE

182
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:22,040
