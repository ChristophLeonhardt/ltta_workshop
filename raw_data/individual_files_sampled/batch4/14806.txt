from Edith prickly and guy Caballero to Bobby bitman and ed Grimley the comedy Titans behind those characters have reunited yes the stars of second city recently got together for a reunion performance in Toronto but a question arises can the brilliant humor that made SCTV so cutting-edge in the late 70s and early 80's fly today given that squeaky wheel constituency known as generation triggered well it was a triumphant homecoming last Sunday when seven cast members of the dearly departed SCTV took to the stage at Serrano's Elgin theatre and better yet next year a comedy special featuring these Giants of sketch comedy will air on Netflix to quote those hosers Bob and Doug McKenzie Beauty a full disclosure I'm about as big a Nessie TV fanboy as you'll ever find se TV was blessed with great writing and top-notch actors although some of them such as John Candy and Harold Ramos they left us way before their time but what made SCTV so knee-slapping funny and delightfully daring was that this show would take on any target yet it wasn't as though SCTV was going out of its way to be purposefully offensive rather it was a matter of people simply not being so easily offended back then by comedians who pushed the envelope when sctv debuted in 1976 I don't even think the word political correctness was in the lexicon for whatever reason audiences weren't so fragile they weren't so perpetually offended look maybe se TV audiences didn't laugh at every joke or embrace every character but they could always wait for the next sketch or in a worst-case scenario change the channel oh what a concept alas today a sour punchline inevitably means a social media lynching today's uber sensitive snowflakes well they will die an apology or a suspension or a termination or at the very least mandatory sensitivity training should a comedian have the other temerity to offend as such I reckon that at least half the SCTV catalogued is just way too offensive for today's bubble wrap social justice warriors and to illustrate my point here are a few snippets of SCTV comedy gold that generated laughter decades ago but would surely be considered verboten today thanks to political correctness for starters consider half-wits a game show comprised exclusively of contestants who are hmm what is the correct word for today challenged what exactly do you do for a living Arthur well it's a job it's nothing special what what what kind of a job I'm just a dog you know nothing normal job what do you do for a living that's fine Arthur don't really care at this point Lois orbit Arthur I don't care what you do thank you now Laurence you were telling us you're still in school right Oh Alex postgraduate work no high school I'm having some degree of difficulty getting through high school are you kidding me making fun of the mentally ill in this day and age of bell hashtag let's talk and miss Thompson and Andrew Lawton oh no way that flies in the current environment then we have local political candidate Jack Brown giving his opinion on how to develop a 300 acre tract of land just outside Mellon Ville and one of the ways that we might be able to do it is by taking this 300 acre tract of land and using it for military purposes I mean God knows we give enough foreign aid to the world and what we got to do now is make this a military installation perhaps a missile silo you know where we have our own defense built right in there we can pick out our own common enemy go to an Atlas flip through the back pages of the index pick a country any country at all unite the people of Mel and bill together then and only then will we be able to protect our farms our source of food from the Asian hordes that we all know are coming because after all we don't eat we get thin and who wants to be as thin as those Asians okay let's see that encompassed everything from glorifying the industrial military complex and there was Edna humor and a dollop of fat shaming no sir that does not air today and how about this excerpt from the martial arts parody blind fists of the Furious Dragon I have learned a secret I passed down to me from generation to generation from my forefathers and now finally to me Oh gracious how dare that honky Dave Thomas depict the Chinese character Lin Yutang you have to wonder what's worse folks the overt cultural appropriation or the violence against women due to Lin Yutang employing his stick foo on that hapless female finally how about this count Floyd presentation dr. tongues 3d House of stewardesses oh and hey whatever you do kids don't forget to put on your 3d glasses oh did you see those big you know those those things just coming right out at you whoo I think my 3d glasses have steamed up there but beyond that I think the feminist founders of the me tube movement are now experiencing cardiac arrest anyway folks I rest my case as for that 2019 Netflix se TV special we'll just have to wait and see who or what will be lampooned but if that TV special features content that touches upon any of the second city parity targets of yester decade well I predict the cast is going to witness off the charts outrage from the usual suspects gee maybe sctv can do a sketch about that it practically writes itself for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's Lloyd Ben Z well folks if you haven't already done so Circle Saturday June
