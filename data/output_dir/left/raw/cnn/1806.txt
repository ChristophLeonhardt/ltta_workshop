1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,790
mr. president welcome back to the
program tell you much I kill him thank

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,030
you very much good to see you
things seem quite different than they

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,160
did last year in the year before what
will happen do you think if President

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:27,800
Trump pulls the United States out of the
nuclear deal jcpoa jcpoa a multilateral

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,350
agreement ratified by the United Nations
Security Council exiting such an

6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,960
agreement would have very high cost for
the United States of America and I do

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,899
not believe that Americans would be
willing to pay such a high cost for

8
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,829
something that will be useless for them
it will yield no results for the United

9
00:00:52,829 --> 00:01:00,120
States but at the same time it will
generally decrease and cut away and chip

10
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,470
away at international trust placed in
the United States of America what would

11
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:13,650
you do what would Iran do options at our
disposal visibly this issue if the

12
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,930
United States pulls out of the jcpoa

13
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:24,659
there has been a great deal of thought
given to this possible scenario

14
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,509
regarding our reaction and if such a
thing were to happen quite swiftly the

15
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,630
world will see Iran's steps and
reactions this action will take place in

16
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,509
a matter of a few days however given
that mr. Drumm reactions and actions and

17
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,689
policies are somewhat unpredictable we
have had long thought and discussions

18
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,479
about our reactions can I ask you
because I've talked to other Iranian

19
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,149
government officials I've spoken to
officials from around the world what do

20
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:06,000
you think of President Trump's Twitter
diplomacy do you see a strategy do you

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,520
see policy do see chaos what what do you
see do you

22
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:19,700
well in any way it is a method that
Mister footage trump has started he

23
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:26,170
knows better than anyone he wishes
perhaps to enter into certain

24
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,070
announcements actively and the head of
the media I don't see it as a problem

25
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:37,580
specifically however what he reads at
certain points doesn't seem to be in

26
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,120
accordance and in line with other
statements from other American officials

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,390
and this by its nature causes a certain
deal of chaos you see what's happening

28
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:54,140
between Burma Myanmar and Bangladesh
Rakhine State the RO hinder minority the

29
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,160
Moslems being being thrown out of
Myanmar

30
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:04,130
what is Iran's position on this and how
dangerous is it in terms of it being yet

31
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,800
another cause yet another Muslim cause
for the terrorists to use as an excuse

32
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,200
to create more terrorism around the
world you read kam Sagara recent

33
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,620
developments are fairly unprecedented
under which 400,000 people have been run

34
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:28,880
from their home and their house is set
oblate by the Myanmar security forces so

35
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,340
it is a human tragedy and it is a
genocide that is taking place and I

36
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:41,210
believe that not only Muslims but all
countries from throughout the world must

37
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:46,370
visa vide the Myanmar government and
then Myanmar Armed Forces stand

38
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:53,870
steadfast against their current actions
and render great deal of support and aid

39
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,220
to the refugees currently entering
Bangladesh is it a magnet to recruit

40
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,610
terrorists hami chingu naked Ahmad these
actions oppression against people

41
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:11,930
running them from their homes genocides
always lay the grounds for extremism and

42
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:19,370
violence and it is possible for
terrorists to wish to use such an

43
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,720
atmosphere and
such a foundation but it is up to us to

44
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,320
not allow them to use these four to use
these as tools to draw people as a

45
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,460
magnet and certainly once their defeat
is ultimately achieved and driven from

46
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,690
seed the Syrian and Iraqi battlefield
they would certainly focus elsewhere and

47
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,380
it is of great danger not only for us
but the rest of the world as well as

48
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:51,920
Europe of course what is your reaction
to the leader of North Korea Kim jong-un

49
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,100
with his sixth nuclear test with his
ICBM missile test with sending missiles

50
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,720
over Japan threatening American
territory what is your reaction to

51
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,890
what's happening there right now and he
has nuclear weapons

52
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:12,350
Massimo Phoolan Raja Basilicata our
position has been very clear and remains

53
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,540
clear visa vie nuclear weapons we are
against any type of weapons of mass

54
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,580
destruction as well as nuclear weapons
and we believe that they must be

55
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,570
destroyed throughout the world
so our opinion our positions are clear

56
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:35,900
arms races are not acceptable to us in
any region and we see that as extremely

57
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,000
dangerous however from the other side
the positions and the actions of the

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
United States as well as other nations
against the North Korean countries has

59
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,200
not been very positive and I don't think
there is a military solution to this

60
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:00,440
only diplomacy is the tool that will
resolve this problem permanently a

61
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,000
security adviser to the president of
South Korea told me that if the Obama

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,060
administration had spent one fifth of
the time it spent with you and Iran on

63
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,140
North Korea's nuclear program it may
have had some success

64
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:20,240
it hasn't spent any time very little
time has been spent trying to make a

65
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,660
deal with North Korea all over our whole
creation anyways North Korea was on

66
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,900
tract of talks and dialogue and those
roads were blocked and both sides chose

67
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,860
non dialogue actions and I think what
the Iranian experience shows is a good

68
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,760
experience that can be replicated
elsewhere and executed elsewhere but

69
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,250
keep in mind please that if the United
States wishes to withdraw from the Joye

70
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:56,610
jcpoa why would the North Koreans waste
their time in order to sit around the

71
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,600
table of dialogue with the United States
because they will think that perhaps

72
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,360
after years of talks and a potential
agreement the next US administration

73
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,520
could step over a pool out of the
agreement achieved so the Trump

74
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,120
administration such action or such
potential action but the Trump

75
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,410
administration will block such potential
roads to success in resolution of

76
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,520
regional problems around the world
President Trump will make his first

77
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,000
address to the United Nations tomorrow
on on Tuesday

78
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,810
he's expected to talk a lot about Iran
as well as North Korea and other issues

79
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,760
but a lot about Iran what do you expect
to hear and if you were to meet

80
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:42,980
President Trump what would you say to
him we can talk the way in which

81
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:49,950
currently in which does for the US
administration has chosen to stand

82
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:55,169
against Iran and the jcpoa has been the
wrong one and the proof has been

83
00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:00,330
experienced by previous administrations
in the United States and the conclusion

84
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,640
is natural to reach that what the Obama
administration is in order to achieve

85
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,640
success in this engagement visa vita
jcpoa and iran drew upon the

86
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,669
unsuccessful unsuccessful experiences of
previous administrations however the

87
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:22,620
path undertaken today by this US
administration is a return to the past

88
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:29,669
to a distant past that goes all the way
back to President Bush number one as

89
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:32,219
well as President Bush the son number
two

90
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,390
so these
have already been traveled upon they

91
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,860
have been unsuccessful and soon that mr.
Trump will see that this was the wrong

92
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,820
path that he had chosen on that note mr.
president thank you very much indeed for

93
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:51,000
joining us man how much richer I'm also
thankful grateful for being here thank

94
00:08:51,000 --> 00:00:00,000
you
