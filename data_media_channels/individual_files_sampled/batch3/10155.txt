Russia's Defense Ministry has warned of an imminent provocation being prepared in Syria one that will see terrorists staged a chemical attack and lay the blame on the Assad government a strike on kafir Zita using poison Laden missiles is planned within the next 48 hours thus some players outside the region are preparing yet more provocations on Syrian soil involving chemical weapons with the aim of destabilizing the situation there and undermining the positive dynamics of the ongoing peace process earlier I spoke to are teased on-quarter about the story well the latest report comes from residents from the it'd Lib province in Syria and they say that a group of civilians is being trained in a nearby area called kafirs it i to carry out the aftermath of a chemical attack to be blamed on the Assad government now eight barrels of chlorine have already been apparently delivered there and the white helmets are ready to perform a fake rescue basically as the ministry says they want to send footage to Arab and english-speaking media outlets and we asked the white helmets for their comment on this on their involvement in the situation but they have yet to respond now Moscow has raised concerns not just about the possible actions of those on the ground hasn't it yeah absolutely just a few days ago quite out of the blue actually John Bolton said that Washington would be willing to respond very strongly if it thinks that the Assad government potentially used chemical weapons let's hear what he had to say we now see plans for the Syrian regime to resume offensive military activities in its Lube province we are obviously concerned about the possibility that Assad may use chemical weapons again if the Syrian regime uses chemical weapons we will respond very strongly now interestingly enough around the same time as John Bolton statement the USS the Sullivans was deployed to the Persian Gulf and according to the Russian Defense Ministry this is a destroyer class ship armed with cruise missiles and the ministry also claims that the u.s. the UK and France might be prepared for a strike there now it lip province what is the situation there at the moment who controls what well it's the last terrorist stronghold in Syria after the Syrian government's victory in and around Damascus they cut a peace deal we're saving thousands of civilian lives but the trade-off was safe passage for the remaining terrorists in the area they were sent in buses to aid lib now for terrorist groups now control that area the most powerful being Hayat Tahrir Assam formerly known as al nusra ties to al-qaeda and the others are RR al Sharm Jaysh al-islam and now or Aldon al Zinke now they're not exactly unified they started warring putting thousands of civilians in danger there's already reports regularly coming out of the area of the headings caging people and even using people as human shields and other reports are suggesting that some of these groups are gathering for a final push against government areas hoping to stage both a chemical attack and to gain support from the West now the situation is made even more fragile because this this specific area was deemed a de-escalation zone after negotiations between Russia Turkey and Iran so with these reports pointing to Western intervention the reorganisation of terrorist groups it's hard to see how any Desco is the de-escalation would happen anytime soon you
