Rick thank you for being with us what is RealtyTrac we're an online marketplace for foreclosure properties and we publish the country's largest database of foreclosure and bank owned homes right now there's about two million of those properties on the website which is higher than we've ever seen in the past so what is the value proposition to your user outside of newspapers are going to realtor or actually actually only twenty percent of all the properties in foreclosure are listed on mls anywhere in the country so more than eighty percent of the properties that are in foreclosure you need to another source to find so we try and make it easy for people that are interested in buying foreclosure properties to find them evaluate them and make the context I need to be able to make this it make the sale so throughout the downturn this past year has your value proposition had to evolve or change to meet new consumer demand or it's interesting we've evolved but not in the way that anybody really would have expected we as the number of foreclosures have gone up and is that has had an effect on the overall economy we've actually found fewer people who are able to buy so our marketplace has changed a little bit from people looking to invest in real estate to a lot of first-time homebuyers and real estate professionals and anyway we've had to adopt our service is a little bit to change with the customer base so has the doubter made you more relevant or just had to sort of evolved from where you were two years ago I think as a source of reliable information we're probably more relevant than we've ever been and probably will continue to be until we're through with this crisis in terms of who's interested and how much buying activity is going on it's a it's a slow market for everybody in the real estate industry right now so I was brushing up yesterday and the foreclosure market is pretty complex what sort of tools do you provide the average user user well it it is a complex process and that's a real critical point is that it's a process not not just an activity so we help people figure out what stage of foreclosure properties and we help them figure out about what's owed on the property versus what the property is actually worth try and get some photography of the of the home so they can get a look at what they're dealing with it will also give them a lot of trending information so they can see what the average sales price of foreclosure properties or other types of properties are in a neighborhood but really give them all the tools that we can give them that will help them analyze the the condition the value the the potential of a property and actually give them an opportunity to connect with local real estate professionals who can help them in the transaction so you fostered a sense of community with your user base and and others in that particular community to make the site a little more sticky yeah it's interesting we've pulled in multiple data sources data streams that sort of merge them all together and in a I guess you know the cliche is a web 2.0 sort of environment but but really what we wanted to do was to give the user the control so if they want to if they want to try and do this by themselves we're going to give them all tools they need if they want to work or somebody else we want to make it easier for them to find somebody else and that's caused us to create training programs real estate professionals because it turns out they didn't know a whole lot about the foreclosure market either and if they're going to help our customers they need to be educated so switching gears a little bit online advertising obviously took a beating last year how has that held up on your site actually we're doing much better than most and and it's because our our user base is a very active community so we have partnerships with companies like Lowe's who are interested in prospects who are going to rehabilitate houses we're apparently one of their best performing advertising sources right now and since we typically am only for relevant advertising content we've weathered that storm pretty well so making advertising relevant you have to know who your users are who are they are they real estate enthusiasts are they general contractors great question of historically about two-thirds of our users have been real estate investors or people who wanted to get into real estate investing in today's market more than half are actually first-time homebuyers we still have a group of real estate investors and the others are real estate professionals of one type or another a large growing contingent is real estate agents who are either looking for investment properties for their clients or looking to do market research in their own neighborhoods to try and figure out what the opportunities are it seems as though you're offering to your users would be a great match for like a trulia or a zillow and I know that truly I believe directs five percent of your traffic to your site is there an acquisition potential in the future what we're a privately held company and we're basically keeping all of our options open I think you're going to see a lot of consolidation in the real estate industry you have been a lot of rumors recently about Google being interested in buying trulia and getting into local market search opportunities and real estate as about as local as it gets so I don't think it's out of the question that at some point we might entertain an acquisition or roll up or something but there's there's nothing on the docket right now great thank you for being with us Rick my pleasure
