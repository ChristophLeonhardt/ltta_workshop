1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,860
so how exactly can the United States

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,280
begin to rebuild its shattered economy

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,360
Matthew<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bishop from The Economist</font>

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,950
welcome you've written this book called

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">the road from ruin in which you spell</font>

6
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:13,299
out how to revive capitalism and put

7
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:16,779
America back on top how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so</font>

8
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:18,490
the aim of the road from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ruin is</font>

9
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,490
actually to say let's look at why we got

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,929
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> this mess and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we can get out of</font>

11
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,670
it so it's not a blow-by-blow account of

12
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,490
who did what to whom but really<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and</font>

13
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at some ideas and you know</font>

14
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,660
fundamentally this crisis was a failure

15
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,809
of ideas there was a set of beliefs that

16
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:37,840
people had that dominated the market the

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,699
world economy for 25 years that actually

18
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:42,280
and ran out of steam such as no such

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,649
there's no very light regulation the

20
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:46,800
idea that markets are always efficient

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,120
the idea that the central<font color="#CCCCCC"> banks could</font>

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually avoid there ever being boom and</font>

23
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,660
bust and the bubbles didn't happen all

24
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,430
those sorts of ideas I think I've been

25
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,710
shown to be wrong actually there's a lot

26
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,269
of work going on in economics at the

27
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:00,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment that actually allows us to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

28
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,399
better set of ideas that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are much more</font>

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,959
realistic about how markets really<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,790
and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people really work and how</font>

31
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,619
institutions work so we need to embrace

32
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:11,080
all those ideas and put them in what the

33
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,720
Fed does and so forth secondly we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

34
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,990
to actually fix the regulatory problems

35
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,240
that were in the system and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

36
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,040
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this caricature of capitalism</font>

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it was it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could work without</font>

38
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,900
government at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all and on the other side</font>

39
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,670
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dislike of all markets and</font>

40
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">the government was always the answer and</font>

41
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:30,430
we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just need to come up with a</font>

42
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,250
much smarter set of rules and regulated

43
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,240
to actually do what they're supposed to

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,009
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that way we can get the</font>

45
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,829
markets to work better we need to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

46
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:42,310
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Americans have also in policy</font>

47
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,649
focus far too much on America as a

48
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:46,780
self-contained economy and this was

49
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,270
fundamentally a global crisis and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

50
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,969
have a global<font color="#E5E5E5"> economy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not</font>

51
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:54,159
properly overseeing so there's all these

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,409
national regulators none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whom are</font>

53
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,270
really up to scratch we need a system of

54
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,040
global rules

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,470
regulations that actually address some

56
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,660
of these global<font color="#E5E5E5"> imbalances like the</font>

57
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,550
power of China and rising power of China

58
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,980
and the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's money is flooding</font>

59
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,800
the American economy and so forth and so

60
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,690
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much everyone trying to</font>

61
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,730
grab cameras and give the sound bites of

62
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,110
what we've got to do to fix it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

63
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,910
forth no one seems to be really

64
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,440
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that anymore we've got</font>

65
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,390
such problems actually fixing the

66
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,170
economy so right now seems we put<font color="#CCCCCC"> aside</font>

67
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,550
what to do to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it doesn't</font>

68
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen again how do we fix what's going</font>

69
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,120
on right now the ten percent

70
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,000
unemployment rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other imbalances</font>

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,590
well you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think one of the things</font>

72
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,840
we do in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book is to go back it</font>

73
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,020
throughout history and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the major</font>

74
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,480
crashes major bubbles major major

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,910
crashes and what happened afterwards and

76
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,830
try to learn some lessons<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that and</font>

77
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,150
you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we are at a position</font>

78
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,850
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> where America could go the way of</font>

79
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,640
Japan in the 1990s it learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lesson</font>

80
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,730
at the Depression in the 1930s by saying

81
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,900
well okay we can't let the banking

82
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,370
system meltdown<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got to put a lot</font>

83
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,350
of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the economy but in Japan</font>

84
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,800
there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> process of denial about how</font>

85
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,680
the credit creation process worked and

86
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing problems were just postponed</font>

87
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,850
endlessly and there was no real getting

88
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to grips with the regulatory challenges</font>

89
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,030
in the system and I think that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

90
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,650
danger that we're in in America at the

91
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,049
moment so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a need for leadership</font>

92
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,620
which it actually means asking some

93
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,510
tough questions about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that how the</font>

94
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,160
system can be improved and do you think

95
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are in denial because every day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

96
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,370
hear people say well they were not Japan

97
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we forced our banks to admit</font>

98
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they made all these terrible loans</font>

99
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,360
and and so forth well my view is that

100
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,730
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the banking sector is in denial</font>

101
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,549
because things got better so quickly and

102
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:44,459
they were in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact bailed out by</font>

103
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,230
trillions of dollars of<font color="#E5E5E5"> taxpayer money</font>

104
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,600
and therefore you know that something

105
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,160
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change to make sure that we don't</font>

106
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,989
repeat that cycle of you know the

107
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:53,850
profits being made by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> banking sector</font>

108
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,350
and then the loss is being taken by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

109
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,120
taxpayer which is not what capitalism is

110
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,209
supposed to be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

111
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,000
we start to actually create reforms that

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,010
matter will we do it or will this all

113
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,630
just be swept under the rug if things

114
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,459
start to get better well i'm adding is a

115
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,470
really big challenge in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gut</font>

116
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,540
and firstly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to stimulate</font>

117
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,980
the economy but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to at some</font>

118
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">point pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soon I'm going to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

119
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,700
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a way out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stimulus</font>

120
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,130
process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to be really</font>

121
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,630
difficult because you know what

122
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,190
politicians are shown over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the years is</font>

123
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,270
they're very good at spending money

124
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,770
they're not very good at stopping

125
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,930
spending money<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so you know I worry a</font>

126
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,860
lot that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

127
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,740
inflation problems coming suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

128
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,320
couple of years down the line<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font>

129
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,910
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's going to be a real danger</font>

130
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,870
that the midterm election cycle you know

131
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,910
having lost in Massachusetts<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

132
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,900
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of pressure on the</font>

133
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,550
Democrats do some a populist things

134
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,550
rather than necessarily the right things

135
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,740
and you know already<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeing a</font>

136
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,250
repeat of the the hearings in the 1930s

137
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,480
we've got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pecora hearings which</font>

138
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,940
produced a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad regulations to</font>

139
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,430
meet the<font color="#CCCCCC"> populace appetite rather than</font>

140
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,110
the intelligent regulations but there is

141
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,760
no one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment in the system</font>

142
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,800
showing leadership you know the banking

143
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,870
leaders you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all basic st. don't do</font>

144
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,610
anything we want to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to normal</font>

145
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the politicians are all to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> table</font>

146
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,260
but actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing anything I</font>

147
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,270
exactly so to summarize it sounds like

148
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,340
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is conceptually a road</font>

149
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,919
back from ruin but that we are

150
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,850
meandering all over the place and not

151
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,380
particularly headed down that road yeah

152
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,110
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you know actually every</font>

153
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,580
bubble that we've had in history I think

154
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost without exception has come out of</font>

155
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">a real innovation something good that's</font>

156
