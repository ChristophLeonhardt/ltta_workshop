Ainsley Earhardt interviewed Donald Trump on Fox News it was a at this point I would argue an instant classic okay he admitted all the things he shouldn't admit that the Jeff Sessions was picked because of loyalty he was upset that he wasn't loyal to him and and recused himself from the case basically it's an admission of obstruction of justice he admitted that he made the payments to stormy Daniels and the list went on and on Rudy Giuliani and every other lawyer Donald Trump has should be immediately disbarred for letting him go on television and say those things on the record but how about man afford so Cohen flipped on him Trump said ah he does like flippers he thinks baby flippers should be illegal okay in other words no one should ever cooperate with law enforcement Manta Ford did not cooperate with law enforcement and Trump loves that look there's a juror on the Manta Ford case who said she was a die-hard Trump supporter came in and wanted to make sure that Manta fort was innocent she listened to the case and she's like no he's totally guilty I really didn't want him to be guilty but he was definitely guilty okay so he cheated on his taxes he committed fraud he's now convicted on eight charges so any rational person let alone the President of the United States who took her oath to the Constitution to enforce the law a guy who brags about being law and order would say well I mean this is a convicted criminal and not a good guy Trump for two days straight has been talking about I'll chip manna for a brave man and now he didn't flip okay he didn't work with law enforcement he's such a good guy hey I mean how is it not clear to you this that Trump's a criminal okay okay fine but if manna Ford who was convicted on other counts not having to do with Trump and I've said that in every time right if mana Ford doesn't have anything on trumped and Trump does I'm too worried about him flipping and because he been afforded his crimes related to his representation of pro-russian Ukrainian president and that led all the way up to 2017 but that's his business not Trump's business why would Trump even care now as I told you on the show yesterday he would care if mana Ford has incriminating evidence about Donald Trump's crimes in case he would want a reward manna fort for not flipping on him and give him a pardon and I told you yesterday on the show well you're gonna have your answer if he's considering a pardon and of course it turns out of course he's considering a pardon here's the person who did the interview with him this is what she said recently listen the notice in his comments yesterday mentioned manna for but not Michael he mentioned pardoning mana Ford and then you have Michael Cohen's attorney in pardoning he did he did and said that he would consider that he feels I think he feels so I think he feels bad for Manta fort yeah he feels bad for him that's probably why so there it is the Fox News anchor who a rude I'm saying yeah he's definitely considering apart from Anna fort now that didn't play well so that was last night so she goes back on Fox this morning did I say definitively well here's what I meant instead and he also said he was never going to he said he never said he was going to pardon Paul Manafort but it sounded like to me that he might be considering it but he never said yes and he never said no backpedal backpedal backpedal backpedal I think she won the gold right was it in China or Russia she with which Olympics issue in the golden backpedaling okay remember you work for Fox News okay all right oh yeah yeah I mean I'm did he said good I said it could have not said it I don't know okay so she was incredibly clear the first time around so that led a lot of people including prominent Republicans to go oh for Christ's sake now Ari Fleischer was a spokesperson for George W Bush when he was the president not only obviously right-wing Republican but he's been all over TV defending Donald Trump for months and months so solidly reliable defender and supporter of Donald Trump here's what he had to tweet I don't care for Trump's style he can be too offensive and divisive I like many of his policies if he fires Muller slash pardons man afford I'd consider impeachment and now he went on to say but nothing so far merits impeachment the remedy for those who can't stand him is political beat him in twenty if you can but people were like whoa you ardent trump supporter just used the word impeachment if he pardons mana fort which apparently he's considering so he had to explain he explained further tweets people are asking me why firing slash pardoning might make me support impeachment here's why Trump has a constitutional right to do both but I believe either one would be obstruction of justice designed to protect himself that's not the purpose of those presidential powers and he went on to add I also think firing a subordinate officer like Comey is different Comey had other duties and lost the trust of POTUS Muller's only job is to investigate Trump firing Muller would be an attempt to interfere with the investigation now I don't agree with him on Comey Donald Trump clearly said on national television I fired him because the Russian investigation clear obstruction of justice but I Fleischer defended him all through that but he's like your fire Muller it's not like Muller has other responsibilities it's not like well you know he runs a car wash and he's a dentist on the weekend so he might have fired him for being a bad dentist no his job is to investigate Donald Trump if you fire him while he's investigating you that is the most clear obstruction of justice anyone has ever seen now a man affort just got convicted of all these crimes but he might have information on you if you pardon him so that he doesn't give that information now that he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison that would be clear obstruction of justice even Lindsey Graham couldn't defend Donald Trump on this one watch if I spent my time talking about what people speculate Trump but if I would have no other thing to talk about I don't think a pardon under these circumstances would go over well I think a lot of people probably feel bad but that's different than using the power of the presidency yeah again a pardon in this circumstance would be perceived by many Americans is you know interfering with an investigation damn he's losing his most ardent supporters Lindsey Graham loved those tax cuts that Trump got for the rich Lindsey Graham is working with the president who tried to push for war on Iran he's got a lot of incentive to keep working with Donald Trump and he's like but if you pardon metaphor what do you want me to do it's so clearly interfering with an investigation tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick he's alienated even people within his own government like Jeff Sessions the entire FBI the entire Justice Department which was incredibly foolish on his part he's alienated so many Republicans who would have to vote on impeachment proceedings and then eventually conviction in the Senate he's obviously alienated everyone else in the country he has almost no allies left Michael Flynn who was his national security adviser has flipped on him Papadopoulos who worked on his campaign has flipped on him Michael Coe and his personal lawyer and fixer has flipped on him and the list goes on and on gates flipped on him and all those indictments have rained down on people who worked on his campaign and administration take take take take take take take take he's running out of time like this video that's great and you never have to miss another episode of TYT by hitting the subscribe button below and ring the bell to
