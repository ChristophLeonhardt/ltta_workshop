1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,022
LITTLE TIME, LELAND.

2
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:06,125
>> GREG PALKOT, THANK YOU.

3
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:12,531
WITH THAT, WE BRING IN GORDON

4
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:14,333
CHANG, FOREIGN AFFAIRS

5
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:14,733
CONSULTANT.

6
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,669
NICE TO SEE YOU.

7
00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:19,338
WE GOT A TIDBIT THERE FROM

8
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:21,040
PALKOT'S REPORTING THAT THE

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,775
NORTH KOREANS WANT TO

10
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:25,077
DENUCLEARIZE ON THEIR OWN

11
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:25,444
TIMETABLE.

12
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:26,779
THEIR TIMETABLE, OUR TIMETABLE

13
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:28,347
HAVE TO BE VASTLY DIFFERENT.

14
00:00:28,347 --> 00:00:29,048
>> CERTAINLY.

15
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:31,283
WE WANT THE NORTH KOREANS TO

16
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:32,418
DISMANTLE IMMEDIATELY.

17
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:34,353
THE NORTH KOREANS WANT TO

18
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:35,654
DISMANTLE THEIR PROGRAM NEVER.

19
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:38,157
SO YEAH, A DIFFERENCE IN

20
00:00:38,157 --> 00:00:38,524
TIMETABLE.

21
00:00:38,524 --> 00:00:40,226
>> IS THERE AN IDEA THAT YOU CAN

22
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:42,561
HAVE A DEAL THAT WE COULD

23
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:43,295
PROPOSE RIGHT HERE?

24
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:45,197
WE COULD WRITE IT UP THAT THE

25
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:46,365
NORTH KOREANS AND THE AMERICANS

26
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:47,800
WOULD ACCEPT?

27
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,302
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THERE'S A

28
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:52,238
PRETTY BIG CHASM THERE.

29
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:53,372
>> THERE'S NO DEAL THAT BOTH

30
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:54,607
SIDES WOULD ACCEPT.

31
00:00:54,607 --> 00:00:56,175
THIS IS AN ISSUE OF NOT OF WHAT

32
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:58,143
THE NORTH KOREANS WANT.

33
00:00:58,143 --> 00:00:59,345
THIS IS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

34
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:01,447
WILL DO TO USE AMERICAN POWER TO

35
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:02,715
PUSH THE CHINESE AND RUSSIANS

36
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:04,550
OUT OF THE WAY AND DO OTHER

37
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,151
THINGS TO MAKE SURE THE NORTH

38
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:07,586
KOREANS DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

39
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:09,054
IF THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY, THEY

40
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:11,957
CAN'T LAUNCH MISSILES, DETONATE

41
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:13,559
NUKES AND KIM JONG-UN CAN'T GIVE

42
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:15,194
GETS TO SENIOR REGIME MEMBERS TO

43
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:16,028
BUY LOYALTY.

44
00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:17,596
WHICH MEANS HE HAS TO GIVE UP

45
00:01:17,596 --> 00:01:18,631
HIS WEAPONS.

46
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:20,466
SO BASICALLY IT'S UP TO THE

47
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,735
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO USE THE

48
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:25,004
ELEMENTS OF AMERICAN POWER.

49
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:30,576
>> WE KNOW THE KIM REGIME LIKES

50
00:01:30,576 --> 00:01:31,477
IMPORTS.

51
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:33,379
YOU TALK ABOUT AMERICAN POWER.

52
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:36,348
PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSED THE

53
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:38,517
NAVAL MIDSHIPMEN GRADUATING AT

54
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:38,884
ANNAPOLIS.

55
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,219
TAKE A LISTEN.

56
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:41,654
>> WE'RE BUILDING THAT MODERN

57
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:44,690
FLEET MANNED BY THE GREATEST

58
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,326
SAILORS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

59
00:01:47,326 --> 00:01:50,329
WE'RE SHARPENING THE FIGHTING

60
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:55,067
EDGE OF EVERYTHING FROM MARINE

61
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:57,736
INFANTRY SQUADS TO COMBAT SHIPS

62
00:01:57,736 --> 00:02:01,507
TO DELIVER MAXIMUM LETHAL FORCE.

63
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:04,777
THE ENEMY HAS TO KNOW WE HAVE

64
00:02:04,777 --> 00:02:05,077
THAT.

65
00:02:05,077 --> 00:02:06,845
>> WE KNOW THAT KIM JONG-UN

66
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:08,146
WATCHES AMERICAN NEWS.

67
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:08,948
HE HEARS THAT.

68
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:10,782
WHAT DOES HE MAKE OF IT?

69
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,351
>> CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN A

70
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:13,819
NUMBER OF THREATS THE AMERICANS

71
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,922
HAVE MADE OVER THE COURSE OF THE

72
00:02:16,922 --> 00:02:17,823
LAST YEAR.

73
00:02:17,823 --> 00:02:20,259
IT'S ALSO -- JOHN BOLTON, WHEN

74
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:21,927
HE WAS A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

75
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:23,262
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

76
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:24,930
HAS FORCED THE NORTH KOREANS TO

77
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,031
CHANGE THEIR POLICIES BUT THE

78
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:27,833
SOUTH KOREANS AND THE CHINESE.

79
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,402
THAT'S WHY KIM IS THERE RIGHT

80
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:30,669
NOW.

81
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:33,138
IT'S NOT ONLY THE SANCTIONS BUT

82
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:34,807
THE THREAT OF THE USE OF FORCE.

83
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:35,941
>> GO BACK TO WHETHER THE

84
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:37,409
PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO USE

85
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,045
COERCIVE U.S. POWER TO NOT ONLY

86
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:41,947
AFFECT NORTH KOREA BUT AFFECT

87
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:42,948
THE CHINESE.

88
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:44,416
THINGS LIKE BLACK LISTING THE

89
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,051
BANK OF CHINA.

90
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:49,355
DO YOU GET THE SENSE THERE'S THE

91
00:02:49,355 --> 00:02:50,122
POLITICAL WILL IN THE

92
00:02:50,122 --> 00:02:51,490
ADMINISTRATION TO DO THAT?

93
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,092
>> NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR

94
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:53,425
MOMENT.

95
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:54,627
>> KIM SEEMS TO KNOW THAT AT

96
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:55,294
SOME LEVEL, RIGHT?

97
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:56,261
OR THINKS IT?

98
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,063
>> I THINK THAT HE SORT OF

99
00:02:58,063 --> 00:02:59,999
LOOKED AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH

100
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:00,666
ZTE.

101
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,535
ZTE IS THAT EMBATTLED CHINESE

102
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:04,870
TELECOM EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER.

103
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,138
THE CHINESE SAID PUBLICLY,

104
00:03:06,138 --> 00:03:08,240
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A TRADE

105
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,243
DEAL, MR. TRUMP, UNLESS YOU GIVE

106
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:14,747
US SANCTION RELIEF ON ZTE.

107
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:17,349
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WILL DO

108
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:17,716
THAT.

109
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:19,618
TRUMP WILTED UNDER PRESSURE THAT

110
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:21,920
DOESN'T MEAN HE CAN'T PUSH THE

111
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,721
CHINESE AROUND AGAIN.

112
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:24,723
OUR PRESIDENT NEEDS TO DO THAT

113
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:26,992
AS A DEMONSTRATION FOR KIM.

114
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:28,761
ONCE HE SEES THAT TRUMP IS

115
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:30,863
WILLING TO BULLY THE CHINESE A

116
00:03:30,863 --> 00:03:32,464
LITTLE BIT, THEN I THINK KIM

117
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:33,932
WILL ACTUALLY START TO PLAY BALL

118
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:34,566
WITH US.

119
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:37,202
UNTIL WE TO THAT, THIS IS GOING

120
00:03:37,202 --> 00:03:38,270
TO BE VERY DIFFICULT.

121
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,072
>> IF YOU'RE KIM JONG-UN, YOU

122
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:41,974
SEE HIM BULLY THE CHINESE, IT'S

123
00:03:41,974 --> 00:03:43,976
EASIER TO BE BULLIED AS THE

124
00:03:43,976 --> 00:00:00,000
NORTH KOREANS HAS THE CHINESE.
