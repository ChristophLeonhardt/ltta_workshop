00:00:09,685 --> 00:00:10,951
AIRPORT, NEED TO OCCUPY EVERY

3
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,992
WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN IF WE

4
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:18,893
DON'T STAND FOR ANYTHING.

5
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,227
PAUL: THAT WAS DEMOCRATIC

6
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,263
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE

7
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:23,564

PRIMARY IS ONE OF THE CANDIDATES

11
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,409
PULLING THE PARTY LEFT AHEAD OF

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,311
THE NOVEMBER MIDTERMS.

13
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:38,346
LAST WEEKEND CALIFORNIA

14
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:39,480
DEMOCRATS DEALT A BLOW TO

15
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:42,383
ANOTHER PARTY ELDER, ENDORSING

16
00:00:42,384 --> 00:00:47,688

DELEON OVER FOUR TERM SENATOR

DELEON BACKS A SINGLE PAYER

HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

21
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,568
KARL ROVE SERVED AS DEPUTY CHIEF

22
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:06,807
SO WELCOME, KARL.

23
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:09,343
HOW DIVIDED ARE DEMOCRATS GOING

24
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:10,144
INTO THIS ELECTION?

25
00:01:10,145 --> 00:01:12,646
>> WELL, INCREASINGLY DIVIDED

26
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:14,215
BECAUSE YOU JUST TOUCHED ON A

27
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:15,116
COUPLE OF THEM.

28
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,851
WE'VE SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT THE

29
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:20,688
PRIMARY SEASON, THAT IN CASES OF

30
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:24,158
RACES WHERE THE DEMOCRATS HAD A

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,893
SHOT TO WIN, THEY THREW IT AWAY

32
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:27,261
BY GOING HARD LEFT.

33
00:01:27,262 --> 00:01:29,263
THE KEY EXAMPLE TO ME WAS

34
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:30,598
NEBRASKA TOO.

35
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,832
THIS IS THE MOST DEMOCRATIC PART

36
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:32,333
OF NEBRASKA.

37
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:34,602
IT IS PART OF THE STATE THAT

38
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:36,337
OBAMA CARRIED, THAT HILARY

39
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:37,304
CLINTON DID WELL IN.

40
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,239
THEY HAD A DEMOCRATIC

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,473
CONGRESSMAN UNTIL RECENTLY.

42
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,308
HE WAS TRYING TO GET THE

43
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,977
DEMOCRAT NOD BACK AGAIN.

44
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,745
AND HE'D HAVE A SHOT IN THE

45
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:45,513
GENERAL ELECTION.

46
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:46,847
BUT THE DEMOCRATS INSTEAD WENT

47
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:50,284
HARD LEFT WITH A WOMAN NAMED

48
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:53,521
KARA EASTMAN WHO IS IN FAVOR OF

49
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:56,123
MEDICARE FOR ALL, FREE COLLEGE,

50
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:58,492
GUARANTEED JOB WITH A GUARANTEED

51
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,727
PAYCHECK, AND IN A MIDWEST

52
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:01,595
DISTRICT LIKE THAT, THAT IS SANE

53
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:03,130
AND SENSIBLE, EVEN A LOT OF

54
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:04,298
DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO FIND THAT

55
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,800
TOO MUCH TO GO FOR.

56
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:08,269
PAUL: BUT YOU KNOW, KARL, LOOK,

57
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,503
OCASIO CORTEZ IT SEEMS TO ME HAS

58
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:11,205
A POINT AT LEAST ON ONE THING,

59
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:13,707
AND THAT IS ENTHUSIASM AND

60
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:14,408
ENERGY AND PASSION.

61
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,146
IN 2010, AS YOU KNOW, THE

62
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:20,881
RESPONSE FROM REPUBLICANS TO

63
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:22,249
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS DRIVEN IN

64
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,688
PART BY THAT KIND OF PASSION.

65
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,256
VOTERS KNOW THAT TRUMP IS GOING

66
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:31,258
TO HAVE THE VETO AUTHORITY.

67
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,827
BUT THE DEMOCRATS MAY BE

68
00:02:32,828 --> 00:02:34,962
MOTIVATED ENOUGH TO PUT A CHECK

69
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:36,964
ON THAT AND SOME OF THESE ISSUES

70
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:37,731
MAY NOT MATTER AS MUCH.

71
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:40,601
>> WELL, MAYBE, BUT LOOK, SHE

72
00:02:40,602 --> 00:02:42,670
COMES FROM A VERY LIBERAL

73
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:43,237
DISTRICT THAT IS NOT

74
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:44,538
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COUNTRY.

75
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,906
WHEN SHE GOES OUT TO CAMPAIGN

76
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:48,442
AROUND THE COUNTRY, SHE'S GOING

77
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:50,244
TO RAISE QUESTIONS THAT LOCAL

78
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:51,545
CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

79
00:02:56,852 --> 00:02:57,651
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, IF SHE

80
00:02:57,652 --> 00:03:00,688
COMES IN AND CAMPAIGNS FOR

81
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:02,790
COLLIN ALLRED, PEOPLE WILL ASK

82
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,493
HIM DO YOU AGREE WITH HER THAT

83
00:03:05,494 --> 00:03:07,695
ISRAEL IS CONDUCTING AN ILLEGAL

84
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:08,395
OCCUPATION OF PALESTINE?

85
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,930
ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF FREE JOBS,

86
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:16,604
ARE YOU A DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST?

87
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:18,405
SOME OF THAT STUFF WILL WORK

88
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,174
WELL IF YOU ARE IN, YOU KNOW,

89
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,544
TO WIN A LOT OF SEATS IN PLACES

90
00:03:23,545 --> 00:03:26,714
LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN,

91
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:28,115
ILLINOIS AND TEXAS AND THE PARTS

92
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:29,350
OF CALIFORNIA THAT DON'T LIKE

93
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:33,954
HOW THEY VOTED IN THE BAY AREA.

94
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:36,891
PAUL: KARL, THEN WHAT YOU DO IS

95
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:38,792
YOU DON'T INVITE CORTEZ OR

96
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:40,394
WARREN IN THOSE DISTRICTS YOU

97
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:41,462
INVITE BILL CLINTON OR SOMEBODY

98
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:43,264
WHO IS MORE POPULAR IN THOSE

99
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:43,631
DISTRICTS.

100
00:03:43,632 --> 00:03:45,799
>> SURE, BUT LOOK THIS IS A

101
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,134
SENTIMENT THAT IS GRABBING --

102
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:47,935
THAT IS GAINING STRENGTH INSIDE

103
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:55,509
ROCK STAR NAMED ROBERT FRANCIS

104
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,778
FOR THE U.S. SENATE AGAINST TED

105
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,294
BUT HE CAME OUT THIS WEEK IN

106
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:17,631
IT MAY BE POPULAR IN THE

107
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,670
STATE LIKE TEXAS.

108
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:24,471
TAKE PENNSYLVANIA, THIS IS A

109
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,873
DISTRICT HELD BY A REPUBLICAN,

110
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:28,409
WON BY HILARY CLINTON, THEY

111
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,743
NOMINATE THE MOST LEFT WING GUY

112
00:04:29,744 --> 00:04:31,412
RUNNING IN THE PRIMARY TURNS OUT

113
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:33,180
TO CONTRIBUTED $300,000 TO

114
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:34,114
ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPPORT

115
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:35,349
DISINVESTMENT IN ISRAEL AND IT

116
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,153
IS -- THE DISTRICT HAS THE 38TH

117
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:39,853
HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF

118
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:40,888
CONCENTRATION OF JEWISH VOTERS

119
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,324
OF ANY DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY.

120
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,326
SO YEAH, LOOK, IT MATTERS THAT

121
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,393
YOU STAND FOR SOMETHING.

122
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:48,329
BUT IF WHAT YOU STAND FOR

123
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,663
SOMETHING IS HARD LEFT POLITICS,

124
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,832
AND YOU'RE RUNNING IN SORT OF

125
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,733
MIDDLE AMERICA, THEN THE

126
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:54,435
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS NOT GOING TO

127
00:04:54,436 --> 00:05:00,874
WIN AS MANY SEATS AS IT MIGHT

128
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,542
OTHERWISE HAVE WON.

129
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:03,444
PAUL: ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE

130
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:04,812
SEEN OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS IS

131
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:08,148
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE OUTPERFORMED

132
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:09,416
WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD

133
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:10,651
EXPECTATIONS FOR VOTER TURNOUT.

134
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:12,152
THAT'S GENERATED BY ENTHUSIASM.

135
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:14,455
A LOT OF IS WE SAW THIS IN

136
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:15,155
VIRGINIA IN PARTICULAR IS

137
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:15,990
ANTITRUMP ENTHUSIASM.

138
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:18,258
WHY ISN'T THE BEST DEMOCRATIC

139
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,393
ARGUMENT WERE TO BE SIMPLY

140
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:20,294
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WE ARE

141
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:21,295
GOING TO PUT A CHECK ON

142
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:21,795
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

143
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,167
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE CHECK ON

144
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:27,468
TRUMP.

145
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,311
CANDIDATES ARE DEFINING THEIR

146
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:38,812
AGENDA BY ADOPTING LEFT WING

147
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,114
POSITIONS, MEDICARE FOR ALL,

148
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:41,215
FREE COLLEGE, GUARANTEED JOBS

149
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:41,715
AND SO FORTH.

150
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,483
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

151
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:44,785
IF THEY RAN A SORT OF CENTRIST,

152
00:05:44,786 --> 00:05:46,153
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO WORK

153
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:52,192
RELATIVELY MODERATE CENTRIST

154
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:53,994
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS, WE'RE NOT

155
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:55,362
NUTS CALLING FOR IMPEACHMENT.

156
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:56,664
WE'RE NOT CALLING FOR THE

157
00:05:56,665 --> 00:05:57,431
OVERTHROW OF THE GOVERNMENT.

158
00:05:57,432 --> 00:05:58,632
THEY COULD WIN A LOT OF SEATS,

159
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,234
BUT THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF

160
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,468
CANDIDATES THEY ARE NOMINATING

161
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:02,369
IN SOME CRITICAL RACES.

162
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,837
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, IF THEY WERE

163
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:06,340
SMART, THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD

164
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:06,607
DO.

165
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:07,675
TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR OLD

166
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:12,312
STOMPING GROUNDS, WISCONSIN, A

167
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:14,915
LEFT WINGER RUNNING IN WISCONSIN

168
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,182
WON.

169
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:16,583
IT TURNS OUT TO NOT ONLY BE LEFT

170
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,852
WING BUT TURNS OUT TO BE A

171
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:20,154
DEADBEAT WHO COULDN'T EITHER PAY

172
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:21,722
BACK LOANS TO HIS FORMER WIFE OR

173
00:06:27,929 --> 00:00:00,000
THE MOST LEFT WING.
