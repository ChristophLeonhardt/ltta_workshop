you
I am I am relieved excited relieved and
also is a great sign you know it this is
not just a bridge this is in many ways
symbolic of all the rebuilding we're
doing the new LaGuardia the new JFK the
new Penn Station and it's working and
we're doing it fast and we're doing it
right and we're doing it efficiently
which people don't expect from
government so it feels good
