to world records were broken in the space of just 15 minutes by Russian athletes of the Winter Olympics in South Korea earlier today the first was set by figure skater Yevgenia medvedeva in the women's short program but her score was then topped minutes later by her own teammate Alina Zagat of it with the details in Pyeongchang is Elia petrenko the younger Russian figure skater had been hot on the heels of her older teammate for a very long time and there you have it evgeny amin videmic could only enjoy her world record for a few minutes because then Alina Ziggy tava did even better and scored an extra point as to what it takes to set these kind of world records both figure skaters include some of the most sophisticated elements in the sport and we see them at the end of the program all these difficult jumps when the athletes are more worn out it's a high risk but if everything goes smooth it automatically adds skyrocketing points I guess something precious for us journalists to take note of was the reaction of UVA Nia following her immaculate performance she said it was not my best but it was okay and apparently that okay was enough for a world record well indeed we heard from experts in the sport that Ziggy Lewis program was more difficult so I guess she definitely deserve it when it comes to the other competitors it seems that now they can only hope for bronze they are way too far behind so it looks like the female figure skating competition at these Olympics M Pyongyang is turning into a head-to-head class between two Russian teenage girls 18 year-old evgeny Madrid d'Ivoire and 15 year-old Elena's agitha mom they got one coach they are from one country but of course they only have one gold medal to compete for at Pyeongchang 2018
