Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio during Donald Trump's interview with Bret Baier on Fox News it became abundantly clear if it wasn't clear already that Trump seems to have an affinity for dictators around the world specifically Vladimir Putin and also the leader of China but first I want to start off with Trump's support of Putin and how he insisted that Russia should be involved in these g7 summit so it would be the g8 of course Russia was expelled from these summits because of the fact that they had annexed Crimea in Ukraine now a Bret Baier asked him about that and here's why Trump wants Russia to be involved take a look you know we spend probably 25% of our time talking about Russia he said to myself wouldn't it be better if they were here I'm not for Russia I'm for the United States as an example if Vladimir Putin were sitting next to me at a table instead of one of the others and we were having dinner the other night in Canada I could say we do do me a favor would you get out of Syria would you do me a favor would you get out of the Ukraine get out of Ukraine you shouldn't be there just come on no I think I'd probably have a good relationship with him if he were at that meeting I could ask him to do things that are good for the world so this is actually good news because previous reporting indicated that Trump was not receiving any counsel any advice on such important issues and now it appears that he is working with one aide in particular and we have some video of his mentorship take a look for you naysayers I have two strong words for you come on dad well I didn't know he was emulating him okay then that makes sense okay I am always reminded of christine o'donnell's ad that was the republican in delaware a while back who ran a campaign ad saying I'm not a witch opening up the question as to whether she was a witch so when when Trump says now I'm not for Russia I'm for America you're the President of the United States of America you you shouldn't have to say that said this on the other hand come on and look at what a again I feel bad for kids every time I say this but what a child if the Russia was sitting next to me I'd say hey do me a favor do me a favor get out of Syria come on okay Magra guys really you're are you really you think that's how it works Putin's like oh oh I didn't know that oh you wanted a favor here I'll pass the banana pudding and I'll get out of Syria you think that's how it works anything Putin's a schmuck oh I didn't know you're gonna ask me for a favor okay because what is Trump done his whole life he runs these companies does that he game the money he bankrupted six companies and he normally goes into negotiations and goes they're not gonna get out of Crimea to do your favor I mean this is worse than bush george w bush said that he looked into Putin's eyes and saw that he had a good heart oh Jesus Christ a bunch of children and gave him the nickname pooty pooty Trump just how did pootie poot I'd say pastor a1 sauce and get out of Syria yeah well look Trump seems to again have some affection admiration for people who tend to be dictators tend to be authoritarian another perfect example is how he applauds the leader of China now the leader of China essentially did away with his own term limits so he can be the leader of China indefinitely and here's what Trump had to say about that a very good relationship with President Xi of Chinese you know incredible guy just essentially president for life it's pretty good president for life that's pretty good no look it's that's kind of terrifying though that's kind of terrifying he does think that he does think that uh I've told you a million times he doesn't believe in our former government he doesn't believe in democracy so why doesn't an attorney general work for me that's right why does he work for the American people I don't get it why does he enforce the law if I don't want him to enforce the law because you are not a dictator and but he's like Oh Putin Oh that'd be great kids are good and OH President Xi from China president for life pretty good we're really good friends it's not a thing you're supposed to encourage we're supposed to be the shining city on a hill you could say hey that's marketing and it's not true et cetera but at least we should be a decent example and other presidents at a minimum pretended to be they pretended to care about human rights they pretended as some of a mented cared about democracy and didn't want to encourage dictators by going president for a life pretty good huh almost as good as touch up on a well-done steak two easy ways
