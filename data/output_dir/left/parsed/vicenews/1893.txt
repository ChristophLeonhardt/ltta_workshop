hi I'm Simon Ostrovsky and this week
I'll be hosting on the line fielding
your questions about Russia and its
pivot from the conflict in Ukraine to
the Middle East and Syria my question
was very simple are the Russians
actively participating in the fighting
with their active service members so if
you've got any questions about Russia's
domestic policy or its newest adventures
abroad then send us your questions on
skype or twitter with the hashtag on the
line
