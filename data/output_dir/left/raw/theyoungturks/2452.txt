1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,720
NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA TELL ME TO

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,510
CELEBRATE BIPARTISANSHIP AND
THAT IT'S A

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,510
WONDERFUL THING.

4
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,040
I THINK IT DEPENDS.

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,800
IF THEY COME UP WITH A GOOD
COMPROMISE, I UNDERSTAND AND

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR
COMPROMISE.

7
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,890
WE ARE PRACTICAL BUT OFTENTIMES
THEY COME UP WITH

8
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,650
DISASTROUS COMPROMISES AND THAT
IS THE CASE IN THE IMMIGRATION

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,650
BILL

10
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,160
SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THEY
CAME UP WITH JUST LAST NIGHT.

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:29,509
TALKING POINTS MEMO REPORTING:

12
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:45,649
THAT 

13
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:53,510
IS A TERRIBLE COMPROMISE.

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,879
ON THE ONE HAND, OKAY, YOU
PROTECT DREAMERS, BUT THEY

15
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,410
HAVE AN ENORMOUS PATHWAY TO
CITIZENSHIP.

16
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,410
12 YEARS.

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,870
REMEMBER, INDENTURED
SERVITUDE WAS SEVEN YEARS.

18
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,659
IN RETURN FOR THAT DONALD TRUMP
ASKED FOR A PREPOSTEROUS

19
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:17,320
$25 BILLION AND THE DEMOCRATS
GAVE IT TO HIM AND THEN YOU

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,630
CAN'T PROTECT THE DREAMERS
PARENTS.

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,909
YOU CAN'T SPONSOR FAMILY
MEMBERS FROM COMING IN, IN THE

22
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:24,450
PARTICULAR PROVISION I JUST READ
TO YOU.

23
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,110
ALL OF THESE HORRIBLE PROVISIONS
ARE IN THERE.

24
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,009
BEGINNING TO CUT DOWN ON NOT E
LEGAL IMMIGRATION BUT LEGAL

25
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,220
IMMIGRATION AND THE DEMOCRATS
SAID YES.

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,619
NO HERE COMES THE TWIST.

27
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,899
AFTER THEY AGREE TO THIS
TERRIBLE COMPROMISE TRUMP COMES

28
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:44,500
IN AND GOES, HA HA, NOT GOING
TO GIVE IT TO YOU ANYWAY.

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,789
SO HE SENDS THE DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SECURITY TO GO CRAP ALL

30
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:55,579
OVER THE COMPROMISE LEGISLATION.

31
00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:00,189
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY SAYS:

32
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:05,310
THAT IS VERY STRONG LANGUAGE.

33
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,788
OBVIOUSLY PREPOSTEROUS BUT THEY
DO NOT WANT THIS TO PASS.

34
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:11,611
DONALD TRUMP HAS TOLD THEM HE
DOESN'T WANT TO COMPROMISE.

35
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:12,611
HE WANTS EVERYTHING.

36
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:14,660
HE DOESN'T WANT A COMPROMISE
THAT IS MASSIVELY IN FAVOR

37
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,740
OF THE REPUBLICANS, HE WAS
EVERYTHING BECAUSE HE THINKS

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,300
THESE DEMOCRATS ARE SO WEAK AND
PATHETIC I WILL JUST BREAK THEM

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,470
AND THEY WILL GIVE ME EVERYTHING
AND GET NOTHING IN RETURN.

40
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:34,959
IT IS ACTUALLY A FEASIBLE
OUTCOME KNOWING THE DEMOCRATS.

41
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,569
THEY CONTINUE:

42
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,620
AGAIN, OUTRAGEOUS OVER-THE-TOP
TALK.

43
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,620
PREPOSTEROUS.

44
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,849
NONE OF THE PROVISIONS HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH HOW THE

45
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,432
9/11 TERRORIST GOT TO THE
COUNTRY.

46
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:50,440
THEY GOT IN ON BUSINESS AND
TOURISM AND STUDENT VISAS.

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,150
THIS DOESN'T ADDRESS ANY OF
THAT.

48
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,310
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE WALL
AND NONE OF THE 9/11 TERRORISTS

49
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,790
WERE DREAMERS, THEY JUST MADE
THAT UP.

50
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,489
THERE IS NOTHING THEY WILL NOT
STOOP TO, TO TRY TO GET

51
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:04,489
THEIR WAY.

52
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:08,150
IT WAS SO OUTRAGEOUS THAT EVEN
LINDSEY GRAHAM, I THOUGHT

53
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,599
HE WAS BUDDIES WITH DONALD
TRUMP?

54
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,120
IT TURNS OUT, HE WAS
DISAPPOINTED.

55
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
IN FACT

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,930
HE SAYS HE IS INCREDIBLY
DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE

57
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,709
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
FOR RELEASING SUCH A

58
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,150
POLITICIZED STATEMENT.

59
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,940
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT FROM THE
TRUMP WHITE HOUSE?

60
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,980
THESE POLITICIANS DRIVE ME NUTS.

61
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,970
OH GOLLY GEE, THE TRUMP WHITE
HOUSE IS BEING POLITICAL.

62
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,540
I'VE GOT THE VAPORS.

63
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:43,620
AND THEN GRAHAM CONTINUES TO
SAY:

64
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,319
YOU DON'T SAY, LINDSAY.

65
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,659
OF COURSE, THAT'S WHAT THEY DO
ALL THE TIME.

66
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,569
TRUMP IS SAYING YOU GAVE ME
ALMOST EVERYTHING I WANTED,

67
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:52,569
IDIOTS.

68
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:55,630
I'M GOING TO ASK FOR MORE
BECAUSE THEY HAVE ENABLED HIM

69
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:01,730
AND THEY HAVE EMPOWERED HIM TO
DENIGRATE ALL PROGRESSIVES

70
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,540
PRIORITIES AND TO DEMAND
EVERYTHING IN RETURN SO

71
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,510
HEY, DEMOCRATS, HOW IS THAT
NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

72
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,599
WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

73
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,890
BECAUSE I WAS TOLD YOU GUYS PLAY
THREE-DIMENSIONAL CHESS AND

74
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,610
YOU ARE ALL PRACTICAL AND
GENIUSES AND IF YOU JUST GIVE IN

75
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,800
TO TRUMP OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THAT YOU WILL GET YOUR WAY.

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,829
DOES IT LOOK LIKE WE ARE GETTING
OUR WAY?

77
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,100
NO, YOU'VE TRADED AWAY
EVERYTHING.

78
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,610
THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

79
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,490
THERE ACTUALLY IS ONE COMPROMISE
BILL THAT IS NOT SO BAD.

80
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,660
LOOK, IT IS NOWHERE NEAR PERFECT
AND IT HAS A WHOLE HOST OF

81
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,660
PROBLEMS.

82
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,230
I WOULDN'T READ ANYWHERE LIKE
THIS, BUT I AM TELLING YOU,

83
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,930
PROGRESSIVES ARE NOT
IMPRACTICAL.

84
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,630
BUT CORPORATE DEMOCRATS,
ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATS

85
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,210
GIVE AWAY EVERYTHING AND SAY,
THAT IS A PRACTICAL THING TO DO.

86
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,210
NO, IT IS NOT.

87
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,640
THE FIGHT FOR OUR PRIORITIES AS
WELL IS PRACTICAL.

88
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,290
THERE IS, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
ACTUALLY A BIPARTISAN BILL

89
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,570
THAT IS NOT, AGAIN, IT IS NOT
GREAT BUT IS WAY BETTER

90
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:21,130
THAN THE OTHER ONE.

91
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,220
SO A FRIENDLY PIECE OF ADVICE TO
DEMOCRATS.

92
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,150
VOTE FOR THAT ONE, NOT THE
TERRIBLE COMPROMISE TRUMP

93
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,840
IS NOT GOING TO TAKE ANYWAY.

94
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,330
SO INSIST ON THE ONE THAT IS
BETTER AND THEN IF YOU DO

95
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,440
NOT GET YOUR VOTE, THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU DO?

96
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,780
YOU DO A POLITICAL FIGHT.

97
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,020
YOU TAKE IT TO THE PEOPLE AND
YOU SAY, IF THESE BUMS,

98
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,060
YOU KNOW OVER 80%

99
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,970
OF AMERICANS WANT THE DREAMERS
TO HAVE A PATHWAY TO

100
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,970
CITIZENSHIP?

101
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,700
IF YOU CANNOT WIN ON THAT ISSUE
THEN RETIRE.

102
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,180
IF YOU SAY I AM SUCH AN
INCOMPETENT POLITICIAN THAT I

103
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,200
NEED MORE THAN 80% OF THE PEOPLE
ON MY SIDE, PLEASE RETIRE.

104
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,790
PLEASE STEP ASIDE.

105
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,600
LET REAL PROGRESSIVES RUN.

106
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,400
PEOPLE WHO KNOW POLITICS, WHO
ARE PRACTICAL AND KNOW HOW

107
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,140
TO WIN.

108
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,960
SO AGAIN, STICK WITH THE COONS-
MCCAIN BILL AND IF TRUMP AND THE

109
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,320
OTHER REPUBLICANS WON'T VOTE FOR
IT THEN KICK THEIR ASS WITH IT

110
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
AND

111
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,080
THEN GET ENOUGH DEMOCRATS AND
THAT WILL VOTE FOR THAT BILL.

112
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,930
I KNOW, VERY COMPLICATED AND
HARD FOR SIMPLEMINDED

113
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,130
ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATS TO
UNDERSTAND.

114
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,930
OR YOU COULD DO WHAT YOU ARE
LIKELY TO DO, GIVE DONALD

115
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,020
TRUMP EVEN MORE.

116
00:06:33,020 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ARE UNBEARABLE.
