WAS LIKE TO WORK WITH HIM.

57
00:01:49,747 --> 00:01:53,183
>> THE FIRST TIME WAS AT A

00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:55,152
IT WAS JUST BEFORE HE BECAME

60
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:55,519
PRESIDENT.

61
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,756
THEN LATER ON I MET HIM IN THE

WHITE HOUSE, I WAS INVITED TO

63
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:02,393

00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:21,478
TOOK HER TO THE WHITE HOUSE,

73
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:21,979
IT WAS FANTASTIC.

74
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:22,646
REAGAN WAS A SCHMOOZE HER.

75
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:30,521
HE LOVED TO HOLD COURT,

76
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:31,388
DOESN'T MATTER IF THERE WAS

77
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:31,989
DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS,

78
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:32,656
INDEPENDENTS, AND MADE NO

79
00:02:32,656 --> 00:00:00,000
DIFFERENT.
