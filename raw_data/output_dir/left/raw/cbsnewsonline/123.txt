1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:04,870
HAPPENED IN SYRIA RECENTLY. 

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,874
I THINK HE KNOWS IT BETTER THAN 

3
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:08,241
THE MEDIA. 

4
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,677
HE UNDERSTANDS IT AND IS NOT 

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,277
HAPPY ABOUT IT. 

6
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,645
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A PRESIDENT 

7
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,982
AS TOUGH ON RUSSIA AS I HAVE 

8
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:16,516
BEEN. 

9
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:22,021
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

10
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,424
>> DO YOU BELIEVE--[INAUDIBLE 

11
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,692
QUESTIONS] 

12
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,125
>> WE'RE FINISHED. 

13
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:26,392
LET'S GO. 

14
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:27,994
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

15
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,428
>> COME ON KEEP MOVING. 

16
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:29,828
LET'S GO. 

17
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:31,397
>> YOU COULD HEAR REPORTERS 

18
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:34,834
TRYING TO ASK THE PRESIDENT A 

19
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,903
FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT--THE 

20
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:37,904
PRESIDENT NOT AMUSED ABOUT 

21
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,839
WHETHER OR NOT HE BELIEVES 

22
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,442
VLADIMIR PUTIN DID NOT MEDEL IN 

23
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,442
THE ELECTION. 

24
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:46,746
THE PRESIDENT NOT ANSWERING 

25
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:47,380
THAT REITERATING THE IDEA AND 

26
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,150
ASSERTION HE'S BEEN TOUGHER ON 

27
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,051
RUSSIA THAN ANY OTHER 

28
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:52,485
PRESIDENT. 

29
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,786
WEIJIA JANG JOINS ME NOW. 

30
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,588
WEIJIA, YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY WE 

31
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:56,355
HAVE WEIJIA THERE. 

32
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:57,790
DO WE HAVE YOU THERE? 

33
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,891
>> YOU SURE DO. 

34
00:00:58,891 --> 00:00:59,993
>> OKAY GREAT. 

35
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,694
WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 

36
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:02,962
BACKTRACK SAYING HE MISSPOKE 

37
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:03,329
YESTERDAY. 

38
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,431
BUT THEN YOU KNOW THIS MORNING 

39
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:06,131
HE'S BEEN TWEETING. 

40
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:13,939
HE'S BEEN PUSHING BACK AGAINST 

41
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:14,273
HIS CRITICS. 

42
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:14,940
HE HAS GONE ON THE RECORD AGAIN 

43
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,209
TWEETING THAT HIS CRITICS HATE 

44
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,712
THE FACT HE'S GOTTEN ALONG SO 

45
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:20,446
WELL WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AND 

46
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:24,484
SAYING THEY SUFFER FROM WHAT HE 

47
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,184
CALLS TRUMP DERANGEMENT 

48
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:25,885
SYNDROME. 

49
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:30,557
I GUESS WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE 

50
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,524
WITH THE PRESIDENT A TENDENCY 

51
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:33,493
TO AT TIMES APOLOGIZE OR 

52
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,561
BACKTRACK AND THEN KIND OF 

53
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,095
CIRCLE BACK AROUND AGAIN TO 

54
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,029
WHAT HE ORIGINALLY SAID. 

55
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,598
>> THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S 

56
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,099
EXACTLY WHAT HE AS DONE HERE 

57
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,468
EVEN THOUGH WE SAW THAT 

58
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:43,135
REVERSAL YESTERDAY, HE HAS 

59
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:44,837
FOCUSED ON WHAT HE WANTS TO 

60
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,539
TALK ABOUT WHICH IS HIS BELIEF 

61
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,142
THAT THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY 

62
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:49,575
SUCCESSFUL MEETING. 

63
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:51,611
YOU HEARD HIM RIGHT THERE 

64
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,013
SAYING NO ONE ELSE HAS BEEN AS 

65
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,715
TOUGH ON RUSSIA THAN HIM. 

66
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,151
NO ONE IS GOING TO DISAGREE 

67
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:01,688
ENGAGEMENT WITH RUSSIA IS 

68
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:01,988
IMPORTANT. 

69
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,957
IT IS THE QUALITY OF THAT 

70
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,391
ENGAGEMENT THAT MATTERS AND SO 

71
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,961
FAR WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF 

72
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,395
THE QUALITY JUDGED ON SUBSTANCE 

73
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:12,265
IT IS VERY LITTLE SO IT IS 

74
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:12,899
DIFFICULT TO DRAW A CONCLUSION 

75
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,102
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS THAT IT 

76
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,571
WAS SUCH A VICK TOROUS SUMMIT. 

77
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,639
IN FACT ANNE-MARIE THE RUSSIAN 

78
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,741
EMBASSY IN THE U.S. IS 

79
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,042
PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION THAN 

80
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,043
THE WHITE HOUSE IS. 

81
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:29,249
THEY ARE TWEETING OUT THAT THE 

82
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:29,915
RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY IS 

83
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:31,818
READY FOR THE PRACTICAL PLEDGES 

84
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,154
OF AGREEMENT IN THE AREA OF 

85
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,390
GLOBAL SECURITY REACHED BETWEEN 

86
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,024
THESE TWO PRESIDENTS. 

87
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:38,925
WHAT AGREEMENTS THEY ARE 

88
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,395
TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE NO IDEA. 

89
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,330
YOU KNOW, I WAS PRESSING WHITE 

90
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,232
HOUSE SOURCES TODAY ABOUT THIS 

91
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,969
TO RELEASE ANY SORT OF DETAIL 

92
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,272
ABOUT WHAT WAS AGREED UPON IN 

93
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,807
THAT ROOM BETWEEN PRESIDENTS 

94
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,207
TRUMP AND PUTIN. 

95
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:57,010
AND THERE ARE SO MANY AREAS 

96
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,647
THAT THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS THAT 

97
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:04,384
HE HAS STARTED THE DIALOGUE 

98
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,018
ABOUT WHETHER IT'S SYRIA, NORTH 

99
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,285
KOREA. 

100
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,721
BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY 

101
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:09,088
DELIVERABLES. 

102
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:09,989
JOHN BOLTON, THE NATIONAL 

103
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,258
SECURITY ADVISOR ALONG WITH 

104
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,060
OTHER SENIOR ADMINISTRATION 

105
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,527
OFFICIALS SET VERY LOW 

106
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:17,597
EXPECTATIONS IN TERMS OF THOSE 

107
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:17,964
DELIVERABLES. 

108
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,967
BUT NOW YOU HAVE RUSSIA 

109
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:22,601
CLAIMING THAT THEY ACTUALLY DID 

110
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,772
REACH AGREEMENTS WHETHER THEY 

111
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:26,372
ARE FORMAL, VERBAL, INFORMAL, 

112
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,406
WE DON'T KNOW BUT AGAIN THE 

113
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,876
PRESIDENT HIMSELF AND THE WHITE 

114
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,146
HOUSE HAS NOT GONE THAT FAR TO 

115
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,447
SAY THAT THEY ACTUALLY CAME TO 

116
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,648
TERMS WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THAT 

117
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,317
THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE WORKING 

118
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,320
ON AND HERE ARE THE NEXT STEPS 

119
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,687
TO GET THERE. 

120
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,154
WE DON'T HAVE THAT. 

121
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,089
ALL WE HAVE AT THIS POINT AS WE 

122
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,623
JUST HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT 

123
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:48,227
AT THE CABINET MEETING WAS THAT 

124
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:48,760
IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS. 

125
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,596
AND THAT'S THE FRUSTRATION 

126
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:50,829
HERE. 

127
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,498
IT'S NOT THAT, YOU KNOW--NOBODY 

128
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,200
IS ARGUING IT'S A BAD THING FOR 

129
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,370
HIM TO GET ALONG WITH PRESIDENT 

130
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,137
PUTIN AND HAVE THESE MEETINGS. 

131
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,839
AGAIN IT IS THE QUALITY OF THAT 

132
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,008
MEETING THAT MATTERS AND WE 

133
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,978
CANNOT TELL WHAT THAT QUALITY 

134
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,745
IS WITH JUST A BLANKET 

135
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:07,346
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT 

136
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:07,813
SAYING IT WAS GREAT. 

137
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:08,481
>> IT'S NOT JUST THAT. 

138
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,882
I MEAN THIS WOULDN'T BE THE 

139
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,684
FIRST TIME THE PRESIDENT GETS 

140
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,053
OUT IN FRONT OF HIS COMMUNITY 

141
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,255
STAFF BUT EARLIER TODAY HE 

142
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,456
TWEETED THIS MORNING THAT ONCE 

143
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:19,125
AGAIN MANY POSITIVE THINGS CAME 

144
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,894
OUT OF THAT MEETING INCLUDING 

145
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,596
RUSSIA HAS AGREED TO HELP WITH 

146
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,530
NORTH KOREA WHERE THE 

147
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,566
RELATIONSHIP WITH US IS VERY 

148
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,033
GOOD. 

149
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,400
THE PROCESS IS MOVING ALONG. 

150
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,968
WELL ONCE AGAIN WEIJIA WHAT DID 

151
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:30,903
THEY AGREE TO? 

152
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:34,474
AGREE TO HELP WITH THE 

153
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,509
DISMANTLING OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS? 

154
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,179
AGREE TO HELP WITH OTHER 

155
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:40,580
NEGOTIATIONS? 

156
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,013
THAT'S A HUGE DEAL. 

157
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:46,952
>> YEAH OF COURSE IT IS BUT THE 

158
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:49,355
PROBLEM IS THAT NOW THERE'S A 

159
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:49,989
QUEUE. 

160
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,326
NOW WE HAVE TO PILE ON TO THESE 

161
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,494
DISCUSSIONS ON NORTH KOREA THAT 

162
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:57,997
HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN CLARIFIED 

163
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,166
BETWEEN KIM JONG-UN AND THIS 

164
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:00,533
ADMINISTRATION. 

165
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,868
THE PRESIDENT RECENTLY IN THE 

166
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,870
PAST DAY OR SO HAS SAID LOOK 

167
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,272
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME 

168
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,307
TO DENUCLEARIZE AND I'M OKAY 

169
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:08,607
WITH THAT. 

170
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:10,442
EVEN THOUGH THE PROBLEM IS THEY 

171
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:12,444
SIGNED A JOINT STATEMENT AND WE 

172
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:13,613
SAW THEM TOGETHER AND THE 

173
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,348
PRESIDENT CLAIMED VICTORY THERE 

174
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:15,948
WE DO NOT HAVE THE SUBSTANCE 

175
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,617
AND THE PRESIDENT IS NOT 

176
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,087
CONCERNED OR IT SEEMS THAT HE'S 

177
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,622
NOT CONCERNED THAT NORTH KOREA 

178
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,590
HAS NOT PROVIDED ANY DETAILS 

179
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,626
ABOUT HOW IT PLANS TO 

180
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:27,960
DENUCLEARIZE. 

181
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,729
SO HOW RUSSIA IS GOING TO HELP 

182
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,197
IN THAT PROCESS, IT'S VERY 

183
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,299
DIFFICULT TO ANSWER BECAUSE WE 

184
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:37,370
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT 

185
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:37,870
PROCESS IS BECAUSE THE 

186
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,673
PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS NOT BEEN 

187
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:47,146
ABLE TO TELL THE AMERICAN 

188
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,281
PUBLIC WHAT KIND OF CONCRETE 

189
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:48,881
EVIDENCE THAT HE HAS THAT KIM 

190
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:49,515
JONG-UN IS ACTUALLY TAKING REAL 

191
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,883
STEPS TO DISMANTLE HIS WEAPONS 

192
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:51,450
THAT ALREADY EXIST. 

193
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,052
HE CONTINUES TO SAY THAT IT IS 

194
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,155
A GREAT SUCCESS BECAUSE NORTH 

195
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,624
KOREA IS NO LONGER TESTING 

196
00:05:58,624 --> 00:05:59,424
WEAPONS AND DESTROYING TESTING 

197
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:02,128
SITES BUT THE QUESTION IS NO 

198
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,228
LONGER ABOUT TESTING MISSILES. 

199
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:05,698
IT'S ABOUT ALL OF THOSE WEAPONS 

200
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,365
IN THE EXISTING ARSENAL. 

201
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,633
HOW YOU ARE GOING TO LOCATE 

202
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,935
THEM, HOW YOU ARE GOING TO 

203
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,770
CONTROL THEM AND GET RID OF 

204
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:10,970
THEM. 

205
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,105
AND WE ARE STILL WAITING ON THE 

206
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:14,540
ANSWER FOR THAT SO AGAIN THIS 

207
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,976
SECOND PART OF THIS THAT NOW 

208
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,245
RUSSIA IS GOING TO ASSIST IN 

209
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:19,945
THAT PROCESS IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S 

210
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:23,049
WAY TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT 

211
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,952
RUSSIA'S ROLE WHEN YOU HAVE NOT 

212
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:30,957
EVEN RECEIVED ANY FIRM 

213
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:31,524
INFORMATION AND COMMITMENTS 

214
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:31,924
FROM NORTH KOREA. 

215
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:32,325
>> RIGHT INDEED. 

216
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,093
I WANT TO QUICKLY PIVOT BACK TO 

217
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,527
THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 

218
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:38,431
CORRECTING HIMSELF SAYING THAT 

219
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,098
DURING THAT PRESS CONFERENCE HE 

220
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,468
MEANT TO SAY THE WORD WOULDN'T 

221
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,736
INSTEAD OF WOULD. 

222
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,805
WHICH DIDN'T REALLY SORT OF 

223
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,139
OFFER ANY MORE CLARITY BUT WE 

224
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,742
JUST SAW HIM IN HIS CABINET 

225
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,309
MEETING AND REPORTERS WERE 

226
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,211
YELLING OUT A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 

227
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,412
I'M TOLD NEAR THE END A 

228
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,781
REPORTER ASKED WHETHER OR NOT 

229
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:57,016
RUSSIA WAS STILL TARGETING THE 

230
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,551
U.S. AND LOOKED LIKE HE SHOOK 

231
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,152
HIS HEAD AND SAID NO. 

232
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:02,722
HE COULD HAVE BEEN SHAKING HIS 

233
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,191
HEAD IN GENERAL LIKE NO SORT OF 

234
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,995
USHERING EVERYONE OUT I'M NOT 

235
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:09,695
ANSWERING THE QUESTION. 

236
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,931
DO WE HAVE ANY SORT OF FIRM 

237
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,900
CLARITY ABOUT WHAT THIS 

238
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,333
PRESIDENT BELIEVES? 

239
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,768
DOES HE BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA IS 

240
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,104
STILL TARGETING THE U.S. IN 

241
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,506
REGARDS TO OUR UP COMING 

242
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:20,806
ELECTION? 

243
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:24,210
>> AT THIS POINT, WE CAN ONLY 

244
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,545
LOOK AT WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 

245
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,346
SAID AND IT IS SUBSTANTIAL 

246
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,514
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS 

247
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,216
FOR THE FIRST TIME YESTERDAY 

248
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:35,288
WHEN HE SAID THAT HE ACCEPTS 

249
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,089
THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE 

250
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,257
COMMUNITY'S CONCLUSION THAT 

251
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,191
THERE WAS RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE. 

252
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:41,327
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WAS THE 

253
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,829
FIRST TIME HE MADE THE 

254
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:45,297
DISTINCTION BETWEEN 

255
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,098
INTERFERENCE AND COLLUSION. 

256
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,700
AROUND THAT IS AN IMPORTANT 

257
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,334
DISTINCTION BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD 

258
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,870
HIM SO MANY TIMES SAY THAT THE 

259
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,838
COLLUSION IS A WITCH HUNT BUT 

260
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,439
HE HAS CONFLATED THE TWO. 

261
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,709
AND SO HE HASN'T REALLY COME 

262
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:57,977
OUT AND BEEN FIRM ABOUT WHETHER 

263
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,780
HE BELIEVES THE EVIDENCE ABOUT 

264
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,948
RUSSIAN MEDDLING AND FOR THE 

265
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:02,815
FIRST TIME REALLY YESTERDAY HE 

266
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,182
SAID I DO BELIEVE IT. 

267
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:04,516
I ACCEPT IT. 

268
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:06,419
WE'VE HEARD HIM IN THE PAST SAY 

269
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,320
I THINK IT WAS RUSSIA. 

270
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,588
IT MAY HAVE BEEN RUSSIA. 

271
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:11,123
BUT EVEN YESTERDAY AFTER HE 

272
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,825
SAID I ACCEPT THE CONCLUSION IT 

273
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,493
COULD HAVE BEEN OTHER PEOPLE. 

274
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:18,264
IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE 

275
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:18,464
ELSE. 

276
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,098
AND SO THERE'S ALWAYS A FOOT 

277
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,367
NOTE THAT GOES ALONG WITH A LOT 

278
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,002
OF THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKS 

279
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,836
INCLUDING THE ONE YESTERDAY 

280
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,973
THAT WAS MEANT TO SORT OF 

281
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,274
CLARIFY HIS STANCE BUT THAT 

282
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,110
STILL AND YOU MAKE A GREAT 

283
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,379
POINT IS FUZZY BECAUSE WHILE HE 

284
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,580
IS MAKING THIS DECLARATION HE'S 

285
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,115
ALSO FOLLOWING IT UP WITH 

286
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,551
SAYING OTHER PEOPLE MAY HAVE 

287
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:38,984
BEEN INVOLVED TOO. 

288
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:41,520
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT 

289
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,188
REPORTERS HERE ARE COMPING AT 

290
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,224
THE BIT AND VERY EXCITED 

291
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,626
BECAUSE SARAH SANDERS IS HAVING 

292
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:49,095
A PRESS BRIEFING AT 2:00:00 

293
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:49,362
P.M. 

294
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,232
THIS IS OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY 

295
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,834
TO ASK HER THESE QUESTIONS 

296
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:59,071
AFTER THIS WHIRL WIND TRIP. 

297
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,606
AND SHE HAS A LOT TO ANSWER FOR 

298
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,841
NOT ONLY WHEN IT COMES TO 

299
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:05,711
MEDDLING BUT ALSO THE SUBSTANCE 

300
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,848
OF THE MEETING, THE AGREEMENTS, 

301
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:09,448
WHY THE PRESIDENT IS CLAIMING 

302
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,651
VICTORY SO I EXPECT IT WILL BE 

303
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,517
A VERY HEATED CONFERENCE TODAY. 

304
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:15,053
>> I BET IT WILL BE. 

305
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:15,687
WEIJIA JANG, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

306
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:15,954
>> SURE. 

307
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:18,924
>>>  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT 

308
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:20,092
MORE NEWS BUT FOR NOW WE ARE 

309
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:25,898
GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
