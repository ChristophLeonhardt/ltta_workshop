take a step and reject its edge that was the rallying cry for hundreds of thousands of Armenians in April and May this year who took to the streets and forced the resignation of Armenia's president turned prime minister suresh later his ruling republican party stepped down from power clearing the way the leader of the Opposition Nicole passion to lead a new government if you do not accept the legitimate request of the state then goodbye The Velvet Revolution so named for being nonviolent was a remarkable turning point for the Caucasus nation mr. passion yon who now heads an interim administration has sought to capitalize on widespread public support bring about sweeping reforms he has promised to tame the oligarchs monopolizing armenia's politics and the economy old new elections and transform Armenia into a liberal democracy at the same time he must play a delicate balancing act here politically between Russia and the West Moscow provides economic and military support to Armenia which has been geographically isolated by both Turkey and Azerbaijan Armenia fought a war over the nagorno-karabakh region with Azerbaijan in the 1990s and Azerbaijan once it's internationally recognized territory back the conflict could reignite at end time I'm robbing for a steer Walker in Yerevan I've come to the Armenian capital to meet the man whose mass protest movement brought down an entrenched corrupt elite but he now faces deep challenges from within his country and beyond today Armenia is prime minister Nichole passion Yan talks to al-jazeera Nicko passion young Prime Minister of Armenia thank you for talking to Al Jazeera I was here without Jazeera for those incredible few weeks in April and May of this year when the Armenian people rose up in their hundreds of thousands and brought down the previous government this was something many people believed was impossible and it was done without a shot being fired what have you achieved so far you know most important thing that we changed already it's the perseverance of the their own role of the people of any citizen it is most important change that we have done already because before revolution the most part of Armenian citizens they considered that they didn't decide anything that nothing depend from their position from his position but we make our citizens believe that their position their voice is most important factor in our political and social life and that's most important change that we have already done but you've still got to deliver on those important reforms people want changes they want functioning utilities they want public services they want a reformed police service they want jobs how are you going to deliver these to a public that is hungry for change and based on history there isn't an awful lot of patients after revolutions people want it yesterday they don't have an awful lot of patience to wait around you need to implement those changes quickly we are now in process of the involvement new people to the Armenian economy we are going to guarantee the Equality and now we can say that all people all citizen in Armenia are equal before the law we we are going to make economic reforms to liberalize our economy to make it more attractive for foreign investor and for domestic investor how we are going to do that we are going to guarantee security of any investment we are going to create infrastructure with high quality and we are going to make people believe and act in economy and create their own businesses and to be to be really to have real opportunity to become successful and make our country more successful you don't have a huge amount of foreign policy experience you're not a military man and yet your country has this conflict ongoing with its neighbor Azerbaijan and your team of Ministers are even younger than yourself and you're just 43 years old so are you qualified for this position and for this job you know when in our Parliament Republican deputies tried to show that I'm not enough experienced to to be Prime Minister I recalled the example of Nelson Mandela who was just a prisoner for 26 years before becoming president of the South African Republic so I've just said that I was in politics in Armenia from the 1991 and I was a journalist that brought so many articles on military officials on state officials about the political activity and that was a huge University and huge experience for being politician for being Minister for being Prime Minister for being president because I followed all these people and I wrote many articles what was right in their action and what wasn't right in their action right now you're an interim government you need elections to have legitimacy when other is going to happen when you're going to have those elections if our political situation will stay same as we have now I think we will have elections snap elections next year okay but initially you want it snap elections and those aren't exactly snap elections it's a it's a year on from this revolution that's going to frustrate people isn't it you need those elections sooner No yes but our important goal to have really democratic transparent and free elections and the problem is that for other political actors it wasn't expected to have such political changes and for them it is it is an expected situation and if we will have snap elections now it we it would be not a very equal situation for other political actors we don't want to to have an equal political field and we want to give our political opponent to our political opponents a time for preparing for that elections it's being consistently maintained that this revolution was not a color revolution it was not manipulated or influenced by political forces outside the country but in order to carry out the reforms and changes that you need you are going to need significant financial assistance from the likes of the European Union and the United States you know we hope to have with that financial assistance not only from the United States European Union but from Russia as well you have been to Russia twice in the last two months as far as I know you've been to Sochi and Moscow you've met with Vladimir Putin you've just got back from Brussels how are you going to balance that relationship between Russia and the West it is a difficult balancing act to maintain you'll have to agree there I don't think that there is a need to balance this relationship we are going to increase the quality of our relations not only with Russia but also with the European Union with United States with Iran with the with China with India etc with Georgia and we are going to build that relationship on a base of the national interests of our menu nevertheless you depend on Russia strategically and economically but you are yourself in favor of openness in favor of transparency democracy and human rights these are European values how do you stay on the right side of Vladimir Putin you know we saw within our revolution that our partners I mean Russia European Union and United States Iran all our international partners they respect our independence and our sovereignty and they didn't interfere to our domestic affairs just a few days ago you had Russian military drills taking place they have military presence in Armenia those drills were taking place Armenian people were upset very upset by what happened it's a very difficult situation to be in where support for Russia is important to you as I said strategically but at the same Rochon military representatives have already apologized for that incident and I think it's an acceptable incident and I have announced already that it was a provocation against the Armenian Russian relationship and it was provocation against the Armenian independence of Armenia sovereignty of Armenia and now there is investigation that started and I think that who is guilty for that incident should be punished this is an example of the ways in which it can be seen that Moscow can use its influence on Armenia when it needs to it has Gazprom here monopolizing the energy market it guarantor security between Armenia you know Azerbaijan but the situation is that many countries all around the world they have tools to impact to influence on the other countries if we want to say absolutely there is no absolute independence for any country because all countries and the international community now they are connected very very closely I mean in particular is in a very yes difficult situation yeah yeah yes we have we are in difficult situation and we are going to overcome this difficult situation and huge popular support from people that powell government has we are going to use that support for our coming this situation to manage this situation we are going to increase the quality of our relation with Russia with the European Union with United States well let's talk about your relationships with your immediate neighbors perhaps is of even more critical importance Turkey and Azerbaijan Armenia fought a war over the territory of nagorno-karabakh in the 90s that conflict continues to this day albeit a frozen conflict as it's often referred to what are you doing to bring peace to this region between Azerbaijan and Armenia the first thing you did was go to nagorno-karabakh after becoming elected as prime minister perhaps that sent the right signal to Armenians did it's in the right signal to Baku as any democracy we are devoted to exclusively peaceful solution for nagorno-karabakh conflict and it's very important because I'm sure that democracy it is most important factor to create peace in our region because I am sure that there is no any democracy that is willing to start a war - that is willing to use force for solution of any problems people are concerned Azerbaijan has seized some form of territory in knock achieve an important area between you and I it's it's it's wrong information if information they're talking war talk though it's yes aggressive language yes that it is another topic and I'm sure that after why Azerbaijan became more aggressive after Armenian Revolution because you know that that we have big success making Armenia democratic country in fighting corruption to create level playing field to fight monopolies and I think that in Hamal EF has some fears that Azerbaijani people can be inspired from Armenian Revolution and to try to create to make changes similar changes in Azerbaijan and so I think the increase of the aggressive rhetoric by the Azerbaijani government is connected with this situation and I'm sure that Azerbaijani government is trying to distract the attention of his own people from their domestic troubles problem to the nagorno-karabakh problem and so that's why I'm saying that any aggressive move against Armenia its aggressive move against democracy in our region at the same time what are you going to do to bring lasting peace here what are you prepared to give Azerbaijan back in exchange for lasting peace you know we are ready for peace negotiations and that I want to make clear that point and I'm ready for negotiations with President of Azerbaijan it hum Ali ready to meet him yes of course you've invited him to meet with you you know the problem is that we have a negotiation format and Donald Trump doesn't mind breaking negotiation formats he's met with the president you know you know it I don't think it's right right work to do to break some something when you are ensured that you will be able to create something better and you know that there is a negotiation format it's been in place for many years but nothing has come out of it this format is very important for keeping peace and for creating real real opportunity for really peaceful settlement of nagorno-karabakh conflict why because three very important and very influential countries are involved in the OSCE Minsk Group co-chair format data that's Russia that's France and that's United State and I think that this format is able to solve this conflict peacefully if Armenian government and Azerbaijani government will have political will for peaceful solution I can assure you and all international community that as the MOOC any democratic government we have real will and real desire to solve this conflict peacefully and we are ready for negotiation but I want to insist that we aren't going to make anything in the atmosphere of intimidation you know it's very important to create atmosphere of peace in our region you can't hear any hate speech in Armenia connected with Azerbaijan and connected with other bajjali people but unfortunately every day we can he'll hate speech from Azerbaijan toward Armenia and what is very strange and very dangerous we can hurt that speech from even personally from the president of other budget with regards to Turkey regardless of nagorno-karabakh and Azerbaijan how are you going to get the borders reopened with Turkey proper relations re-established with Ankara you know the problem is that it isn't Armenia that closed the border with Turkey in fact it's Turkey that closed border with Armenia in fact that border is open from the Armenian side and it's torquey that should make decision on opening border and Armenia is ready to establish diplomatic relations with Turkey without precondition and without any precondition and that's turkey that should make decision on that with all of this happening at the moment with all of the international infighting that's going on the European Union and the United States did not have a good relationship at the moment liberal democracies in the West are in crisis with the rise of the far-right Russia and the United States have a troubled relationship although Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin seem to be getting along just fine how do you see the the White House particular led by Donald Trump in terms of its impact on what happens to our media and the Armenian context do you look at what's happening in Europe in the United States and think how does this impact Armenia you know of course we are concerned very much on regional situation on the last development around Iran because Iran is our close neighbor and our partner and we hope that all these issues and all this disagreement will be solved to the peace and through the negotiation and Armenia is of course ready to support these processes and we are ready to be constructive in making our region more prosperous and peaceful and more secure the co-passenger prime minister of Armenia thank you for talking to Al Jazeera you
