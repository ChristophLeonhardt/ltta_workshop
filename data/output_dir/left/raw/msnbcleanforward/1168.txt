00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,837
IF THEY HAVE ANY CHANCE OF WINNING THE SENATE THIS IS

2
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:05,171
WINNING THE SENATE THIS IS PRETTY MUCH MUST WIN.

3
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:06,839
PRETTY MUCH MUST WIN. >> THIS IS FASCINATING.

4
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,575
>> THIS IS FASCINATING. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,976
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THIS FLORIDA GOVERNOR’S RACE IS

6
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,344
THIS FLORIDA GOVERNOR’S RACE IS GOING TO BE UNBELIEVABLE.

7
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:13,380
GOING TO BE UNBELIEVABLE. IT’S GOING TO TELL US A LOT.

8
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:15,181
IT’S GOING TO TELL US A LOT. YOU WERE JUST SAYING IT’S GOING

9
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:19,686
YOU WERE JUST SAYING IT’S GOING TO GIVER YOU CLUES TO 2020.

00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,388
TO GIVER YOU CLUES TO 2020. JONATHAN, ANDREW GILLUM BACKED

00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:25,492
JONATHAN, ANDREW GILLUM BACKED BY BERNIE SANDERS, BACKED BY THE

12
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,861
BY BERNIE SANDERS, BACKED BY THE MONEY OF TOM STEYER, IS THAT THE

00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,896
MONEY OF TOM STEYER, IS THAT THE SAME MESSAGE, IS THAT

14
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,533
SAME MESSAGE, IS THAT LEFT-LEANING CANDIDACY GOING TO

15
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:36,370
LEFT-LEANING CANDIDACY GOING TO RESONATE WITH FLORIDA VOTERS?

16
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:37,804
RESONATE WITH FLORIDA VOTERS? IS HE GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST?

17
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:41,208
IS HE GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST? >> WELL, ANY CANDIDATE WHO WANTS

18
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,110
>> WELL, ANY CANDIDATE WHO WANTS TO WIN A GENERAL ELECTION

19
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:43,777
TO WIN A GENERAL ELECTION ADJUSTS SOME.

20
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:48,214
ADJUSTS SOME. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WITH

21
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:51,018
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WITH TRUMP’S TWEETS TODAY, THEY WILL

22
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:54,154
TRUMP’S TWEETS TODAY, THEY WILL POUR SUCH A BUCKET FULL OF MUD

23
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,490
POUR SUCH A BUCKET FULL OF MUD ON TOP OF HIM IT WILL HARD TO

24
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:57,524
ON TOP OF HIM IT WILL HARD TO GET OUT OF IT.

25
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:00,127
GET OUT OF IT. >> HOW WELL IS HE KNOWN

26
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:00,928
>> HOW WELL IS HE KNOWN STATEWIDE?

27
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:03,264
STATEWIDE? >> HE IS NOT KNOWN STATEWIDE.

28
00:01:03,298 --> 00:01:05,399
>> HE IS NOT KNOWN STATEWIDE. THAT’S THE ISSUE WHO DEFINES WHO

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,200
THAT’S THE ISSUE WHO DEFINES WHO IS HE.

30
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:08,502
IS HE. NOT FOR DEMOCRATS BUT FOR THE

31
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,104
NOT FOR DEMOCRATS BUT FOR THE SWING INDEPENDENTS WHO COULD NOT

32
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:11,138
SWING INDEPENDENTS WHO COULD NOT VOTE YESTERDAY BECAUSE IT’S A

33
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:12,506
VOTE YESTERDAY BECAUSE IT’S A CLOSED PRIMARY IN FLORIDA.

34
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,441
CLOSED PRIMARY IN FLORIDA. SO, WHAT WE DON’T KNOW IN

35
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:15,943
SO, WHAT WE DON’T KNOW IN FLORIDA IS WHICH WAY THE

36
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:16,844
FLORIDA IS WHICH WAY THE INDEPENDENTS WILL GO THIS TIME.

37
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:18,612
INDEPENDENTS WILL GO THIS TIME. IN THE PAST, THEY TENDED TO

38
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:19,613
IN THE PAST, THEY TENDED TO TREND REPUBLICAN.

39
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:21,915
TREND REPUBLICAN. BUT THERE ARE QUITE A NUMBER OF

40
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,717
BUT THERE ARE QUITE A NUMBER OF DISAFFECTED REPUBLICANS WHO ARE

41
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:25,953
DISAFFECTED REPUBLICANS WHO ARE NOW DESCRIBING THEMSELVES AS

42
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:26,387
NOW DESCRIBING THEMSELVES AS INDEPENDENTS.

43
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:27,922
INDEPENDENTS. AND THEY MIGHT BE OPEN TO AN

44
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:30,658
AND THEY MIGHT BE OPEN TO AN ARGUMENT FROM THE DEMOCRAT, NOT

45
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,259
ARGUMENT FROM THE DEMOCRAT, NOT WANTING TO GO WITH THE TRUMP

46
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:38,766
WANTING TO GO WITH THE TRUMP GUY, THE TRUMP ROBOT, DESAINTSIS

47
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,435
GUY, THE TRUMP ROBOT, DESAINTSIS BECAUSE THEY DON’T LIKE TRUMP.

48
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,373
BECAUSE THEY DON’T LIKE TRUMP. >> LET’S TALK ABOUT DEEeSANTIS,

49
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:48,075
>> LET’S TALK ABOUT DEEeSANTIS, HE’S GOT THAT AD AND HIS SON

50
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:51,145
HE’S GOT THAT AD AND HIS SON WITH BUILDING BLOCKS BUILDING A

51
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:51,579
WITH BUILDING BLOCKS BUILDING A WALL.

52
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,482
WALL. WHAT’S HIS STATEMENT, AS LARGE

53
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:57,051
WHAT’S HIS STATEMENT, AS LARGE AND DIVERSE AS FLORIDA FOR BEING

54
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:57,451
AND DIVERSE AS FLORIDA FOR BEING PRO-TRUMP?

55
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:59,954
PRO-TRUMP? >> THIS IS GOING TO BE A LITMUS

56
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:00,888
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE A LITMUS TEST FOR 2020.

57
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:03,724
TEST FOR 2020. I CAN NOT WAIT.

58
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,259
I CAN NOT WAIT. I’M VERY EXCITED.

59
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:07,862
I’M VERY EXCITED. THIS IS WHAT DeSANTIS HAS VERSUS

60
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:08,196
THIS IS WHAT DeSANTIS HAS VERSUS GILLUM.

61
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:11,065
GILLUM. IT’S ALL ABOUT THAT BASE.

62
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:12,466
IT’S ALL ABOUT THAT BASE. THEY HAVE TWO TYPES OF BASES

63
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:13,400
THEY HAVE TWO TYPES OF BASES GOING ON.

64
00:02:13,402 --> 00:02:15,069
GOING ON. THEY GOT THE WORKING MAN BASE

65
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,505
THEY GOT THE WORKING MAN BASE BUT IT’S DIVIDED BETWEEN THE

66
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:18,506
BUT IT’S DIVIDED BETWEEN THE TRUMP-SUPPORTED WORKING BASE.

67
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,574
TRUMP-SUPPORTED WORKING BASE. AND THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT

68
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:21,008
AND THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT THAT FEELS LIKE, YOU KNOW,

69
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:22,510
THAT FEELS LIKE, YOU KNOW, THEY’RE THE REAL WORKING CLASS.

70
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:24,612
THEY’RE THE REAL WORKING CLASS. SO YOU HAVE TWO TYPES OF

71
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:26,114
SO YOU HAVE TWO TYPES OF MESSAGES, BOTH CENTERED AROUND

72
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:27,282
MESSAGES, BOTH CENTERED AROUND WORKING CLASS BASE, YOU KNOW.

73
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:29,484
WORKING CLASS BASE, YOU KNOW. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE GOT THAT

74
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:29,817
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE GOT THAT ECONOMY.

75
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,420
ECONOMY. IF I WERE DeSANTIS, I’D BE

76
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:32,987
IF I WERE DeSANTIS, I’D BE PUSHING THAT ECONOMY.

77
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:34,922
PUSHING THAT ECONOMY. AND IF I WERE GILLUM, I WOULD

78
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:36,357
AND IF I WERE GILLUM, I WOULD BE -- YOU KNOW, I GUESS YOU

79
00:02:36,392 --> 00:02:38,993
BE -- YOU KNOW, I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUSH HEALTH CARE

80
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:40,728
WOULD HAVE TO PUSH HEALTH CARE AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT

81
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:42,396
AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT PERTAIN TO DIFFERENT RETIREES OR

82
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:43,331
PERTAIN TO DIFFERENT RETIREES OR SOMETHING IN THE STATE.

83
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:45,066
SOMETHING IN THE STATE. IT IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE

84
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,534
IT IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST RACES THAT EVERYBODY,

85
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:47,869
BIGGEST RACES THAT EVERYBODY, EVERY STRATEGIST IS GOING TO BE

86
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:49,003
EVERY STRATEGIST IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT.

87
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:50,905
LOOKING AT. >> YOU KNOW, I THINK, STEVE

88
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:53,207
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK, STEVE TALKS ABOUT THE ENERGY.

89
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,943
TALKS ABOUT THE ENERGY. AND THERE WERE STRONG NUMBERS ON

90
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:58,213
AND THERE WERE STRONG NUMBERS ON BOTH SIDES BUT, JONATHAN, THE

91
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,248
BOTH SIDES BUT, JONATHAN, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS POINTS OUT THAT

92
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:02,817
ASSOCIATED PRESS POINTS OUT THAT REPUBLICANS CAST 1.6 MILLION

93
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:03,851
REPUBLICANS CAST 1.6 MILLION BALLOTS.

94
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:05,820
BALLOTS. DEMOCRATS ARE ON TRACK TO FALL

95
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:07,855
DEMOCRATS ARE ON TRACK TO FALL BELOW 1.5.

96
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:08,757
BELOW 1.5. WHERE’S THE BLUE WAVE?

97
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,692
WHERE’S THE BLUE WAVE? >> WELL, THERE ARE HIGHER

98
00:03:10,726 --> 00:03:12,126
>> WELL, THERE ARE HIGHER TURNOUTS ON BOTH SIDES BUT

99
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:13,328
TURNOUTS ON BOTH SIDES BUT THAT’S A VERY IMPORTANT FIGURE.

100
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:15,263
THAT’S A VERY IMPORTANT FIGURE. SO THERE’S A LOT OF ENERGY ON

101
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:16,865
SO THERE’S A LOT OF ENERGY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WHICH HASN’T

102
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:18,567
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WHICH HASN’T GOTTEN A LOT OF COMMENT.

103
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:20,202
GOTTEN A LOT OF COMMENT. CERTAIN DEMOCRATS THING THEY

104
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:21,970
CERTAIN DEMOCRATS THING THEY HAVE MIDTERMS IN THE BAG IN THE

105

HAVE MIDTERMS IN THE BAG IN THE HOUSE.

106
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:23,471
HOUSE. BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THEY’VE

107
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:24,773
BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THEY’VE BEEN HEARING FROM PUNDITS.

108
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:27,042
BEEN HEARING FROM PUNDITS. THIS THING IS GOING TO BE

109
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:28,944
THIS THING IS GOING TO BE REALLY, REALLY COMPETITIVE,

110
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:30,345
REALLY, REALLY COMPETITIVE, RIGHT TO ELECTION DAY.

111
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:32,747
RIGHT TO ELECTION DAY. THE STAKES ARE ENORMOUSLY HIGH.

112
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:35,083
THE STAKES ARE ENORMOUSLY HIGH. NOT NECESSARILY THE SENATE RACE.

113
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,952
NOT NECESSARILY THE SENATE RACE. BUT IN THESE HOUSE RACES.

114
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:40,856
BUT IN THESE HOUSE RACES. BECAUSE IF DONALD TRUMP IS

115
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:42,657
BECAUSE IF DONALD TRUMP IS EMBOLDENED BY REPUBLICANS

116
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,560
EMBOLDENED BY REPUBLICANS HOLDING CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF

117
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:47,762
HOLDING CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, EVERYTHING HE’S

118
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:51,400
REPRESENTATIVES, EVERYTHING HE’S DONE SO FAR WILL LOOK LIKE

119
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:51,800
DONE SO FAR WILL LOOK LIKE PATTY-CAKE.

120
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:54,503
PATTY-CAKE. >> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

121
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:54,903
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE REENERGIZED.

122
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:58,373
REENERGIZED. LOOK AT GILLUM, ALEXANDRIA.

123
00:03:58,408 --> 00:03:59,708
LOOK AT GILLUM, ALEXANDRIA. LOOK AT THESE CANDIDATES THAT

124

LOOK AT THESE CANDIDATES THAT HAVE COME FROM NOWHERE.

125
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:03,579
HAVE COME FROM NOWHERE. AND IT’S ALL BECAUSE OF THAT

126
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,016
AND IT’S ALL BECAUSE OF THAT BLUE WAVE ENERGY ON YOUR RIGHT.S

127
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:08,383
BLUE WAVE ENERGY ON YOUR RIGHT.S >> RIGHT.

128
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:09,518
>> RIGHT. >> IN GENERAL, I THINK THAT’S

129
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,220
>> IN GENERAL, I THINK THAT’S THE WRONG CANDIDATE TO PUT OUT.

130
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:12,354
THE WRONG CANDIDATE TO PUT OUT. I THINK THAT’S GOING TO BE

131
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:13,321
I THINK THAT’S GOING TO BE REALLY HARD --

132
00:04:13,323 --> 00:04:15,190
REALLY HARD -- >> ESPECIALLY I THINK WHERE

133
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:16,225

GILLUM COULD HAVE PROBLEMS HE HAS COME OUT FOR ABOLISHING

135
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:18,661
HAS COME OUT FOR ABOLISHING I.C.E.

136
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:20,129
I.C.E. AND THE BEST POSITION FOR A

137
00:04:20,163 --> 00:04:21,630
AND THE BEST POSITION FOR A DEMOCRAT IS REFORM I.C.E.,

138
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:22,331
DEMOCRAT IS REFORM I.C.E., RESTRUCTURE I.C.E.

139
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:25,000
RESTRUCTURE I.C.E. BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY SAY ABOLISH

140
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:26,502
BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY SAY ABOLISH I.C.E., YOU LOSE SOME VOTES THAT

141
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:26,735
I.C.E., YOU LOSE SOME VOTES THAT WAY.

142
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,803
WAY. >> LET’S TALK ABOUT ANOTHER

143
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:28,938
>> LET’S TALK ABOUT ANOTHER PLACE WHERE THAT’S VERY

144
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:29,305
PLACE WHERE THAT’S VERY IMPORTANT.

00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,140
IMPORTANT. THAT’S ARIZONA.

THAT’S ARIZONA. REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, I

REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, I THINK, A SIGH OF RELIEF TO SAY

148
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:36,011
THINK, A SIGH OF RELIEF TO SAY THE LEAST, BUT IF YOU THOUGHT

149
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:38,547
THE LEAST, BUT IF YOU THOUGHT THE RACE WAS ALREADY TOUGH, JUST

150
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:39,248
THE RACE WAS ALREADY TOUGH, JUST WAIT.

156
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:54,263
OWNS OVER 100 PAIRS OF SHOES. I ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE OVER

163
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:05,675
STRONG. >> REAL REPUBLICAN?

164
00:05:05,676 --> 00:05:06,375
>> REAL REPUBLICAN? >> YEAH.

165
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:07,643
>> YEAH. AND I REALLY LIKE HER.

166
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:10,379
AND I REALLY LIKE HER. I THINK SHE WILL DO A GREAT JOB.

167
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:11,347
I THINK SHE WILL DO A GREAT JOB. NO MATTER WHAT, THOUGH IF I LOOK

168
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:13,849
NO MATTER WHAT, THOUGH IF I LOOK BACK AND TAKE MY GOP STRATEGIST

169
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:16,185
BACK AND TAKE MY GOP STRATEGIST HAT OFF, I AM REALLY PROUD THAT

170
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:17,653
HAT OFF, I AM REALLY PROUD THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME, NO MATTER

171
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:18,888
FOR THE FIRST TIME, NO MATTER WHAT, WE’RE GOING TO HAVE A

172
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:19,589
WHAT, WE’RE GOING TO HAVE A WOMAN IN THE SEAT.

173
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:22,091
WOMAN IN THE SEAT. SO IT’S A VICTORY FOR WOMEN AS

174
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:22,391
SO IT’S A VICTORY FOR WOMEN AS WELL.

175
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:24,493
WELL. I JUST HOPE THEY DON’T BEAT EACH

176
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:26,195
I JUST HOPE THEY DON’T BEAT EACH OTHER UP PERSONALLY ON A

177
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:26,996
OTHER UP PERSONALLY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL.

178
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:29,098
PERSONAL LEVEL. >> JONATHAN, YOU’VE GOT 30

179
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:29,432
>> JONATHAN, YOU’VE GOT 30 SECONDS.

180
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:31,500
SECONDS. WHAT’S YOUR TAKE ON THIS RACE?

181
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:33,670
WHAT’S YOUR TAKE ON THIS RACE? >> WELL, SINEMA IS AHEAD IN A

182
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:34,504
>> WELL, SINEMA IS AHEAD IN A RECENT POLL.

183
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:37,273
RECENT POLL. IF SHE GOES ON TO WIN, THAT

184
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:39,409
IF SHE GOES ON TO WIN, THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THERE IS A

185
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,209
WOULD INDICATE THAT THERE IS A BLUE WAVE.

186
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:42,812
BLUE WAVE. AND THAT THE SENATE COULD

187
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:43,680
AND THAT THE SENATE COULD POSSIBLY GO --

188
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:45,415
POSSIBLY GO -- >> DOES IT TAKE A BLUE WAVE FOR

189
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,484
>> DOES IT TAKE A BLUE WAVE FOR HER TO WIN OR IS THERE SOMETHING

190
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:48,418
HER TO WIN OR IS THERE SOMETHING SHE CAN DO?

191
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,286
SHE CAN DO? >> WELL, THERE’S A LOT YOU COULD

192
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:50,820
>> WELL, THERE’S A LOT YOU COULD ALWAYS DO.

193
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:53,523
ALWAYS DO. BUT THE THING TO LOOK AT IS,

194
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:56,025
BUT THE THING TO LOOK AT IS, TEXAS, IT’S TOO CLOSE TO CALL

195
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,728
TEXAS, IT’S TOO CLOSE TO CALL NOW.

196
00:05:58,729 --> 00:00:00,000
NOW. IF TED CRUZ LOSES OR WINS THERE,
