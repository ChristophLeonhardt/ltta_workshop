hey cops don't do this how about you act like a human being dude now the female journals getting arrested here is an editor at the Colorado independent named Susan green who saw a naked black man on a public sidewalk with cops surrounding him and she took out her phone to record because here in America our citizens have to insure our public servants keep compliance and treat our fellow Americans with dignity you know because in so many instances they don't just protect by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is not an acceptable reason for this officer to stop this journalist from recording on a public sidewalk she's not revealing personal medical records of the man you're arresting this is just the clear violation of the First Amendment well that doesn't seem wrong I like that these officers at least did some research to come up with some bullshit legal justification for behaving like fascists like dudes out here trying to act like he cares about the personal privacy of the guy he's arresting for for being unwell if you care about him so much perhaps you should check in on him instead of harassing and assaulting this journalists on the scene instead who at this point is very obviously just trying to film your badge number and document the misconduct between you and her they ultimately release Susan and the man was taken to a hospital but the problem here just like with many other instances where police step out of line is the reality that officers are so quick to pull the trigger and detain people just for questioning their authority and sometimes of course literally pulled the trigger and this reality gets much darker if you're not white non-white Americans make up 38% of the population but account for almost half of those killed by the police in 2/3 of the unarmed deaths this kind of abusive power has devastating consequences like the insane fact that police have killed more than nine thousand US citizens since 9/11 and that violence starts with a justification of excessive force at low impact arrests exactly like this one and then it ends with violence at routine police stops like this one so my message is the all lives matter folks and the free speech warriors on the right is this police misconduct and use of force is an encroachment on our freedoms and it's a it's a problem for all Americans more white folks get killed by police than blacks so even if you're a gigantic racist it should still matter to you so what is it then is it because you assume that because you haven't been mistreated like this in the past that you won't in the future because remember they're arresting doctors too now or is it fine for a few white folks to get dinged up a little here and there with the cops as long as you know that you can call them when you see a suspicious black person walking down the street in your neighborhood I'm a saw biker if you're mad at police misconduct share this video and leave your thoughts in the comment section below also continue the conversation by joining me at my twitch at twitch.tv slash house and I'll be live I'm on every day from 7:00 p.m. Pacific to 10:00 usually and you'll get a notification if you follow also to support independent media please join T YT membership and this has been the breakdown want to see more videos like this well then subscribe to the T y2 channel below also don't forget to become a TYT member you can get access for as little as $4.99 a month also download the TYT Plus app on your phone or head over to T y-t-dot-com slash join today
