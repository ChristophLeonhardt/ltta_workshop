a Fresno State University professor who had some strong words for Barbara Bush after she passed away was being threatened by possibly getting fired but it turns out that university officials are not gonna fire her because it turns out that she has something known as First Amendment rights it's crazy it's almost as if the Constitution has more than just the second amendment crazy so she's a tenured professor but that is not the reason why she's able to keep her job Fresno State is part of the Cal State University system in California it is publicly funded meaning that constitutional rights are intact and if university officials fire her they are literally violating her First Amendment rights now the university carefully reviewed the facts and consulted with lawyers to determine whether we could take disciplinary action we have concluded that professor gerar did not violate any CSU or university policies and that she was acting in a private capacity and speaking about a public matter on her personal twitter account her comments although disrespectful or disgraceful are protected free speech under the First Amendment of the US Constitution so it seemed as though the university officials really wanted to make it clear that they did not like the way that she handled this situation they did not like her tweets but even given the fact that they didn't like the tweets they still have no right to fire her so a couple of points here that are important first of all it bothers me that they keep calling it disgraceful and that goes to a much larger point because in America if you are in favor of war that kills millions of people not a big deal millions of civilians by the way man that's a minor offense a lot of those guys are backing government John Bolton now National Security Advisor Mike Pompeo we're probably going to become Secretary of State soon etc etc they're all over coming everybody applause then yes Bravo honorable gentleman and obviously George W Bush Barbara Bush's son etc and but if you are slightly disrespectful to anyone power whoo that's the third rail you can't do that that's a major major offense we should all have a national conversation about whether you should be fired how dare you nobody gets fired for actually killing the civilians but you get fired for saying hey that wasn't such a great idea to support the idea to kill the civilians and that's what she had attacked Barbara Bush about she said one and a half million dead Iraqis and and she raised the war criminal in was favor of the Iraq war by the way when asked about civilian deaths in Iraq Barbara Bush said that she her beautiful mind couldn't be bothered with that yeah so I would argue that that is far more disgraceful a comment that anything the professor said well Barbara Bush was in a position of power and as a person who has all the privilege in the world you're able to refer to Hurricane Katrina victims who had to be displaced in you know the the Houston Astrodome you get to refer to them as underprivileged and they're better off in the Astrodome anyway like you're able to make those types of disgraceful statements without having to worry about losing you know a job or really being negatively impacted by it look I think that free speech on publicly funded college campuses is incredibly important regardless of what the speech is right as long as you're not doing something unconstitutional inciting violence screaming fire in a crowded room you guys get the point I believe in protecting that speech I don't care if you're someone that I disagree with I don't care if you're someone that I completely agree with it's a free marketplace of ideas and you can't have public employees firing people for speech or banning that type of speech so Washington Post pointed out it was an unsatisfying conclusion for those who argued that tenure should not absolve gerar or anyone from the consequences of their vitriolic words no that's the whole point of tenure it is so it is to allow for words that offend whether they're right-wing or left-wing because you're in in the free marketplace of ideas now that leads us to point number three which is the hypocrisy of the right wing and Anna got me started on this when we first covered the story and it's been growing this this rage has been growing inside of me about their hypocrisy so where are they where's Alden Milo's and all their defenders in the Ann Coulter's etc whatever they're getting paid a lot of money to speak on those campuses oh very Spanish oh my god they took my freedom of thought away but my thoughts are all gone okay now we defend those guys now I think that they're clowns I think their speech is disgraceful etcetera you you name it any adjectives you like there but they have a right to say a neighbor right to get paid a lot of money to say it on a college campus and I'm in favor of that we've been saying from day one but I've noticed that the right-wing online is is not animated about this professors freedom of speech all of a sudden they couldn't care less about freedom of speech in fact they're the ones who want her fired for speaking out no but here's here's the issue and I don't feel bad about the fact that we're fair when it comes to things like this that we're able to you know look at both sides understand what the right thing to do is and still want to protect the speech of those that we disagree with I think that that makes you a good person who genuinely believes in the Constitution but at the same time I go back and forth from feeling proud of not having this ridiculous you know Pro liberal anti conservative stance to feeling like a sucker right because the reality is when conservatives do what they do at Berkeley for instance it's not really about protecting free speech they have created a business out of creating a circus around them they want attention and the best way to get that attention is to put yourself in a victims shoes I am the victim I have been banned and censored and look at these progressives and these liberals they're not letting me speak it's all about getting into the news and being part of a conversation and it's pathetic it's pathetic if I'm gonna do that at least have the intellectual consistency so you could pretend later that you're honest and principled to defend the professor they're not gonna do that first they're not so and and now you look at all the right-wingers online attacking her and offline as well one of the guys said it's a this is not a matter of free speech is a matter of human decency please but wait a minute right-wingers are in favor of and culture coming onto college campuses talking about how she is upset about the Browning of America she calls immigrants peasants she says immigrants from Mexico are peasants and we don't want them here is that it's got a great speech human decency that's hilarious and then another person declared a lot of them knew declared which the professor said here as sate speech no I know you can't wait to charge others with racism even if it doesn't make any sense or hate speech even when it doesn't but I so I need to explain to you are either purposely obtuse or really not very intelligent what hate speech is hey speech isn't I hate this person and I have spoken about them okay no it is about a particular group so there is no group of Barbara Bush's that she offended and targeted like man if you're a Barbara Bush I categorically hate you for just being a Barbara Bush no she did not like Barbara Bush for the things that Barbara Bush did so for example if you hate me which for a lot of your right-wing trolls check and you and you want to talk about that that is not hate speech that it might be hateful but it's not hate speech in fact we would support you if you wanted to go on a college campus and talk about that that's right it's crazy speeches if you say well I don't like Jane not because he's a left-wing you know whatever fill in the adjective but I don't like him because he's a dirty Turk and I hate all dirty Turks okay I guess I mean I I'm kind of I'm so thick-skinned I don't care about anything but yes that would be hate speech because you're attacking a whole group alright I have to explain to be cool because there they don't get it but finally my favorite one was a guy who tweeted in just heard that the fat despicable pig ran de girar won't face discipline unbelievable except Fresno State campus of worthless scum this guy wants her fired for saying offensive things and totally miss the irony of his tweet you just watch the video by the Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea
