00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,149
Good morning, Hank.

2
00:00:01,149 --> 00:00:02,149
It's Tuesday.

3
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:05,680
I have a flu-like illness, so you should prepare
yourself for the worst vlogbrothers video

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,680
ever.

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,780
To make it slightly more entertaining, I'm
gonna play some Project for Awesome livestream

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,419
highlights, so you don't have to look at my
sick mug.

7
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,910
So, Hank, this whole thing started while Henry
was giving me Sharpie face on Saturday morning

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,530
during the Project for Awesome, and I felt
a little tickle in my throat.

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,609
I thought it was Sharpie fumes, and, you know,
maybe it was, maybe Sharpies caused my illness.

10
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,020
But, at any rate, yeah, now I'm miserably
ill, which sucks, because there are only a

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,670
few days left in the Paper Towns shoot, and
I wanna be with those people because awesome

12
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,590
things are happening today in a minivan.

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,290
But I also don't wanna get them sick because
they still have to finish the movie.

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,630
More importantly, the Project for Awesome
has raised over $1.2 million for charity,

15
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,290
by far the most successful P4A of all time.

16
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,120
Nerdfighters, thanks to all of you who donated,
who made P4A videos, who watched them, and

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,520
shared them, and commented, and watched the
live show.

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,610
I don't know what you guys thought of this
year's Project for Awesome -- I'm interested

19
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,340
to hear in comments, but for me it was definitely
the best one yet, at least until I was stuck

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,240
by this terrible Sharpie illness.

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,490
John-from-livestream: Cover it with Sharpie,
yes!

22
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,210
Henry-from-livestream: No, I don't wanna cover
it.

23
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,330
John-from-livestream: Oh, you don't wanna
cover it.

24
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,800
Henry-from-livestream: If you cover it guess
what.

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,380
John-from-livestream: What?

26
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,120
Henry-from-livestream: You like... get forehead
disease.

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,290
Oh, Henry you were so right to be worried
about forehead diseases, which reminds me

28
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,900
to thank my family for their patience and
participation in this year's Project for Awesome,

29
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,770
not least Sarah, who allowed herself to be
covered in jelly.

30
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,850
And I should also mention that the Indiegogo
is still live.

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,340
You can donate for the rest of today and today
only, to get amazing perks, from a calendar

32
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,070
featuring YouTubers before they were YouTubers,
to the Project for Awesome exclusive edition

33
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,240
of The Fault in Our Stars.

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,340
There's also original art by Minute Physics,
An Imperial Affliction, P4A socks, pressed

35
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,450
pennies, and so much more.

36
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,850
Donations are tax-deductible in the US, and
all of your money after manufacturing costs

37
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,970
and shipping goes to charities that are chosen
by the Nerdfighter community at projectforawesome.com.

38
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,200
Ah, man, this reminds me of when #bananaeyes
trended on Twitter.

39
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,390
Happier days, Hank, happier days.

40
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,640
Sarah-from-livestream: Yay!

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,150
John-from-livestream: You look adorable.

42
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,360
How do I look?

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,229
Sarah-from-livestream: It's gross.

44
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:08,869
So Hank, the Foundation to Decrease Worldsuck
works because there's no overhead.

45
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,620
Everyone who packs and ships perks at the
DFTBA Records Warehouse volunteers their time,

46
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,249
as does Sam Rudge, who does the website work,
Karen Kavett, who designs it, Lauren Chernikoff,

47
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:19,750
and dozens of other people.

48
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,970
So to everyone who was part of this year's
Project for Awesome, thank you, thank you.

49
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,249
We did it!

50
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,769
$1 million!

51
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:29,139
Actually like 200,000 more than a million.

52
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,609
Hank, here's a sentence I thought I would
never say: you are the most beautiful mummy

53
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:34,120
dancer the world has ever known.

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you on Friday.
