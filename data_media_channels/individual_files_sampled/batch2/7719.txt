Pam Bondi is the Attorney General in the state of Florida and she is catching a little bit of heat because it turns out that even though she has four months left in her position she is spending her time doing things other than attorney generally she is auditioning on Fox News for a show the five so Bondi subbed on the talk-show not once not twice but three times three times appearing as a panelist Wednesday through Friday so just to give you a little taste of what that was like let's take a look at this clip but you've got an adorable little girl and marshmallow taking a walk around the block innocent ball teeth or an innocent while chasing an innocent little girl and a mom who homeschools her kids like the best mom in the world they chose to pick on in the other case with the president all that it's going to be is in a potential memo for impeachment so where's that where's that where is the where's the credibility of somebody getting to cross-examine him it's not and they're taking what Michael Cohen says is back so that's what troubles me with how they're doing this i they're looking at it to see what happened with Eve Arif i but this guy's been in the country forever and he murdered a beautiful young girl from being in a courtroom my entire career that's who everybody in this country should be focusing on that victim its parents her family can't imagine what they're going through so she's the Attorney General in the state of Florida four months left in her term and I'm I'm happy that she has taken time out of that job to do what's really important spread propaganda on Fox News by the way as Attorney General it's a little worrisome that she subscribes to the propaganda on Fox News you don't know thing Pam Bondi was one of the many Trump campaign scandals because like it was discovered that as she herself was deciding as Attorney General whether to like investigate Trump University mm-hmm lo and behold a few days before she had to make her decision she got a twenty five thousand dollar check from Donald Trump and wouldn't you know it she did not investigate Trump University or she did not go after them right she's in she's in that little she yeah she's in that group she's in that world even though she is catching heat for this I actually do think it's a good thing I would much rather her do the propaganda on Fox News that be in a position of power where she makes those types of decisions I just think one thing that Fox News needs more of sports is like blonde women with brightly colored dresses just extremely bright strong colored dresses that's what they don't have enough and I think they may be I know when I saw it I was like does charity work like I've seen her before on Fox News oh no that's Ainsley Stephanie yeah no but okay so you have seen her on Fox News before because she's a regular guest not a panelist that the panelists thing her auditioning for Fox News is a new development but she has been on Fox News quite a bit to get interviewed about whatever's happening in Trump's administration or whatever's happening in the news so she has been a aple at Fox but now it appears that she's angling for a job but again I'm being completely honest with you go ahead go Morgan why why are people upset at her doing this instead of you know working as an attorney general I don't want her as an attorney general this next message is to Elizabeth Warren Oh Elizabeth Warren is as just announced her plan to lock the wishers on rebel headquarters Jer went to go watch senator because an amazing interview she said we want to lock the revolving door when she's introducing her reforms for a new like act and that revolving door she's talking about is people going from legislation to and regulation to into this very companies that they were regulating and back and forth and back and forth but there is a similar revolving door with cable news where people are in positions of power then they get out of positions of power and they go right into their position on the CNN panel or at this FoxNews panel and what I would say is the difference between going into a job at CNN and going into a job at Fox News is you are just as effective a lobbyist / legislator by being on Fox News that morning because you have it Durrett a more direct line than the president usually he's like I'll have my meeting in a second I gotta watch Fox and % friends maybe it's an apostrophe friends I don't know yeah you make a good point I mean this isn't really that unprecedented it's unprecedented in that you have an attorney general doing it but I mean think about what happened with Cory Lewandowski and all these other Trump affiliated people who immediately got hired by CNN I mean the right I don't know of any oh no how about this Mike Huckabee she should go do that the happiest I've ever seen Mike Huckabee when he was like I'm not gonna run for president he has decided not to run for president he instead decided to keep his show on Fox News and I've never seen anyone as happy as when I watched Mike Huckabee how could he play base with Ted Nugent I've never seen that going up do yourself a favor and watch him just like awkwardly play as they're playing like for the octogenarian audience on Fox News Huckabee I'm gonna see if we can find that clip for the postgame talk about that on the postgame if you're not a member you can join by going to tea white tea network.com slash join but it's these plain cat scratch fever which is like so pervy it's such like a pervy song what are the lyrics Oh God can't scratch fever lyrics bad and also remember Sarah Palin Sarah Palin stepped down from her elected official role in in in Alaska because she said that the the legal bills were just becoming too expensive she'd want to deal with anymore she's a reality show she was a fox news contributor she wrote a book I think who was this alright Oh Sarah Palin yes exactly it's just like she was governor and she's she I don't want to do that why especially in a Trump world being on Fox News the same as being a politician it is that extra like bit of communication know how savvy it's just like there were fireside chats back in the day you know and and Obama would go do an appearance so he could communicate how to sign up for health care Trump's calling in in the morning to Fox and Friends just to be like anyways here is what I have to say are the lyrics of cat-scratch fever I just had them it would be it's nothing dangerous I feel no pain I've got to change you know you got it when you're going insane I it makes a grown man cry and crying won't you make my bed I make the / with the stroke of my hand oh they know they're getting it from me and there's like an 80 year old woman in the audience yeah what but you know it appears based on those lyrics that he knows a thing or two about clitoral stimulation which I commend him for not many do have you heard about the new TYT audio
