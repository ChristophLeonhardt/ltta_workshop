President Trump says he's working hard to save jobs Tolga he would yeah well those jobs are in China what the president tweeted yesterday morning that president G and I are working together to give massive Chinese phone companies ZTE a way to get back into business fast to make jobs in China love wait hold on hold on mitt confessori I'm confused too many jobs in China I thought he was campaigning about that China was taking too many of our jobs I am also there's too many jobs in China lost if any case on it says I will be the ordering my federal government the US government to help save China what's the same jobs in China this is why we elected him to save jobs in China listen I have claw is concerned but it does seem that somebody mixed up like two of his standard tweets and kind of mashed them up and put China for America and you know it's it's just important to remember why we can come move to remove that company from doing business in the US because of national security concerns and were those components creating a risk for American agencies so why he would want to flip that it seems it consistent with his long says you know his important desire to protect us from foreign intervention I'm a little confused now Elise last time I went to Moss Point Mississippi nobody there we're saying Joe you know what I think the biggest problem is that there are too many jobs lost in China I'm worried about jobs in China I am worried about China but Donald Trump is saying can we say Trump calling make China great again across the bottom please look at that boom they already had it so I don't think people in Hattiesburg or Moss Point are worried about making China great again it's kind of a globalist movie Venice I wonder if right Bart is going to brand Donald Trump a globalist now trilateral commission time right wow it's a little looking a little eerie might be a Media we know it this is one of us crowd take me yeah they have to love you now I want to sue is that seriously you wrapped up into the larger trade negotiations you had the US delegation went to China it was a fiasco China's chief economic trade minister leo he was coming to Washington this week he this is obviously part of that exactly what the details China's going to give the president what remains to be seen but this is part of that kind of a Co so Jon Meacham Donald Trump is learning a year and a half in that being president of the United States actually isn't as easy as it seems to be and sometimes there are trade-offs that you have to make and it's not as easy as just going out and throwing med red-meat into the crowd saying we're going to destroy China absolutely and one of the things I think I hate to introduce a serious note here but one of the things the country is going to have to figure out is the people who are skeptical of the way the president's conducted himself rightly skeptical and unhappy is if he does demonstrate a capacity to to do the right thing and does it how do we talk about that and what is the you know what is the vocabulary what's the vernacular of you know what the job is complicated there are difficult tasks politics is the art of compromise it's not just the art of being Donald Trump and if he does in fact if the entertainer in chief becomes the commander in chief what does that look like yeah well it's pretty simple what we'd say he did that's good that would be great I mean I don't yeah I mean will we have time something positive we have time to practice definitely yeah yeah no I you know Richard I do think that if Donald Trump didn't make such a habit of insulting her allies then I do think there could be a good conservative liberal debate around Iran for instance and there has been some some discussion about that the problem is that everything you know we every move whether you're talking about trade deals or whether you're talking about the Paris Accords or whether you're talking about Iran whatever you're talking but there are ways to frame all of those decisions and all of those all of those moves but he doesn't buy tweet by insult and that's part of the problem two things one but take all those things collectively and this is the United States abdicating its role as the foundation of the world order as we knew it I mean look at their Spiegel this week you can't show the headline on family television on the cover but it is essentially a German saying this is the end of the Atlantic Alliance the u.s. European relations they've given up on Donald Trump and you're right if you're going to disagree then you've got to go to the extra mile on process cuz we always disagree you're from an active with our allies but then you've really got to work the process and the consultations hard what's so bad with this administration often is you're disagree on the policy and they feel that they they've simply been ignored not taken seriously and the combination of the two is what's so deadly well and it's on meet some Ronald Reagan I had policies for eight years that not only our allies disagreed with but ninety-five percent of the people in the national media agreed with I mean you know the national media after Reykjavik was saying that poor Reagan the Duke I mean I remember the reports you would have thought that you know America's future was forever compromised by it while there were others of us who thought no that actually that's the move the man had to make so there can be disagreements and you don't expect the liberal media to go along with you every time but you but the one thing Reagan always did James a baker the third would be over there he'd be explaining what Reagan was doing we would be working with him always five steps ahead always and and one of the things that's so interesting about kind of the universal acclaim that nearly universal claim the President Reagan now has in historical terms is you know most of most of the press thought as as Reagan himself once put it that he was a combination of the Mad Bomber and Ebenezer Scrooge in in in real time yet I've always thought and this is why this is why the character is destiny point is so important I've always thought that we've never fully appreciated that Ronald Reagan's most significant life experience coming into the presidency was less his actual movie career and more his labor union career because he negotiated that contract for what six seven eight years and somebody once said what's it like dealing with the Soviets he said well hell you've never dealt with Jack Warner and so he was able to you know come out and that first press conference in 1981 and say the Soviets lied and cheated and wanted world domination but then after he shot he writes a letter by hand to Brezhnev you know he gets a marvelous partner in Gorbachev and so by 1988 the man who called the medieval Empire is literally in Red Square kissing babies and that kind of won praise that there's some some sort of method to this madness I don't think there is no but that we do have I think you you have to have some hope that we stagger we do have prayers thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more for morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
