so Ashley to your other point that there is plan a and plan a so far it appears based on reporting that Judge Cavanaugh was in the white house for a long day again today and over in the executive office building the term of art is murder boards there was something of a murder board kind of a mock hearing to throw at him any and all uncomfortable questions they could think of to prepare him for Monday there sure was um into the White House's credit our understanding is that they are also doing what they should do which is their due diligence they understand that he's made very clear he wants to fight this and their natural inclination as always as led by this president is to fight is to double down but before they're going to back him you'll notice they've made him put a lot of the stuff in his own words and the president has been sort of muted in his defense of just judge Cavanaugh but they want to make sure that there's nothing else about his dating history his interactions with women anything else that happened in high school anything else that happened going forward for their own sake for their own protection and then of course as you said as murder boards to make sure that if and when there is that public testimony that public hearing that he is prepared because as they say at the end of the day a lot of people in the White House believe and it may shape up to be this way that it is going to be a question of credibility and who do you believe it's going to be he said she said and they want to make sure that he is prepared to present his best possible defense in public so just when I thought you and Ashley could not work harder or more day hours per day along comes this story I know you've been working it so I asked if not this nominee then who and when because we're down as you mentioned 49 days away from the midterms yeah it's a good question Brian I think certainly if Cavanaugh's nomination is pulled if he were to withdraw the president the White House would immediately turn to that list that was made public in the campaign and expanded early on into presidency for a replacement there were a few judges who were were on the short list behind Kavanagh that would get consideration but I think the key player in all of this is probably going to end up being Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Cavanaugh was not McConnell's first choice for Trump's pick but he but Trump went ahead and nominated Cavanaugh anyhow McConnell got behind the nomination and has been pushing it through but I think if this nomination were to fail McConnell would seize an opportunity to step in and say let me take control of this process this is all about Senate votes it's about can you get the 50 plus one majority in the United States Senate to bacca nominee and McConnell knows his members much better than the White House does he's going to know who senator Collins senator Murkowski senator flake who they're going to support and I think McConnell's going to try to make the power play to help drive this process in terms of the timing the midterms are coming up it's very difficult to see how they'd be able to get through an entire vetting and nomination process to vote before the midterm elections and then that raises the question of whether they would do this all in the lame-duck session which would be in late November and in December before the new Senate is sworn in in January hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
