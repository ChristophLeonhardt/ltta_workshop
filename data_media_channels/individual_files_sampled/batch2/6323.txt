conservatives are pushing for a new tax cut a new change to the tax code and you're gonna be shocked to find out who it benefits it has to do with the capital gains tax which is a tax levied on profits from the sale of property or an investment now there's some interesting things about capital gains taxes versus regular taxes the top tax rate for long-term capital gains is about twenty four percent which includes a three point eight percent surtax on high earners net investment income which was created under Obamacare which I don't think a lot of people remember communally the capital gains tax rate unfortunately is much lower of course then even the newer 37% top individual income tax rate so I mean you're talking about a significantly lower tax rate than income tax even if in effect that is where your income is coming from which for many rich people is what it is but they don't like a certain thing about capital gains and it has to do with inflation so currently people pay capital gains taxes on the difference between the cost of purchasing something and the amount for which it was sold but conservatives want to change that so the people only pay taxes on the difference between what they paid for the investment plus inflation and the amount for what the for which the investments sold which I mean that sounds complicated but in effect it would significantly cut something like depending on inflation 30 40 or 50 percent of the taxes that these people would be paying and for many rich individuals that is all of the taxes that they pay yeah so we can bring up an example as we talk about this and you'll see how the numbers work out but it's complicated don't worry too much about it so bottom line is it's gonna cost us another hundred billion dollars because the two trillion dollar deficit that they created with the last tax cuts for the rich wasn't enough so they'll throw in a hundred billion dollars okay so and that's over ten years and that keeps on going if it passes so let's break this down first of all Ryan Ellis is senior tax the tax advisor for the Family Business Coalition family business sure says it benefits rich poor middle class everybody that is well good what why have we done it yet then that is categorically untrue that is preposterous you know do you have capital gains so capital gains are if you have stock that you've held for a long long time and some of you might have capital gains said that's understandable you probably have not that much a little bit some of you don't have it at all because you don't have money that you could put into the stock market as an investment and that you could hold for a long time or you have a big property that you sold or you have a big business that you started in then sold and then you get capital gains tax on it rather than regular income no it is almost by definition geared towards the wealthy it is because it is applied to not your salary we all earn a salary right you might earn a high salary or low salary and that's gonna get the regular tax which is higher right this is applied to wealth so I already have money I put the money and I don't need to do anything I don't need to show up and punch a clock or anything right if I'm investing I press the button and then three years later I press another button okay that's kind of how it works and so hey look there's nothing wrong with that you you want people to invest and and you want them to build businesses etc but there is no logical reason why that should be a lower rate than the regular taxes that you pay for the actual work that you do and so and Warren Buffett has talked about this he said look any real investor if they don't get they if they buy into this Republican ideology and they say it because they're probably say nobody will invest if you don't have lower taxes for capital gains nobody less Warren Buffett's like what kind of an investor doesn't invest because they're gonna make a little less money when they pay tax on it then you're not an investor and then go home and be a plumber okay of course we'd invest anyway that's the whole point of being an investor and what kind of a loser says well I was gonna start a business but I hear that Obama added a 3.8 percent surtax to the capital gains now I was still much lower than if I have a job yeah but no I'm not starting the business anymore well that loser would I never started the business in the first place that's not a real entrepreneur that's not works so the whole thing is a fiction it doesn't help the poor at all it almost doesn't affect the middle-class almost at all it is strictly for people who have accumulated a lot of wealth yeah so and in this case they just thought Ted Cruz's proposing this in office proposing it by the way back in 2007 there's a couple of guys who proposed it about eleven years ago obviously one was a young congressman named Paul Ryan in other one was a congressman named Mike Pence couple of walks mmm and so they've been dying to give their this particular tax cut to the rich for a long time part of the reason they wanted to kill Obamacare was because it had that 3.8 percent surcharge though yeah that's a little extra on our wealth accumulation out dare you so they're just as usual and just what the doctor ordered another tax cut for the rich yeah maybe my favorite part of the story though John is that they're like they might have to wait till after the midterms because it might be a little hard for the voters to stomach another tax cut for the rich so in the meanwhile they lied to you about oh we're good we're good we're to look out for you we're gonna look out for you and if you make the mistake of putting the Republicans back insurance like alright that's good for the rich again or they don't even wait and they don't have the congressman do it they just do the executive branch I remember them being really upset when the executive branch under Obama would do things unilaterally yeah yeah yeah maybe if it's tax cuts so they could have the Treasury do it instead and they think with Larry Kudlow is being the top economic adviser and Steve minuchin former goldman sachs former financial scumbag who ripped people off doing foreclosures they think they have a pretty good chance that them go another tax cut for the rich yeah yeah check no problem so that's headed their way and our only hope is that the last tax cut is polling at 27% I mean which is is 26% higher than it should be it should it should be at 1% I'll grant you that 1% of country should be like please serve some more but not the rest of you what are people thinking it's a good 20 present as a disastrous number so that might give them some pause before they do one more tax cuts for the rich
