00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,600
In 1994, a young, Wall Street hotshot named Jeff Bezos was at a crossroads in his career:

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,400
Continue amassing a small fortune...

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,050
...or abandon it all to sell books?

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,260
That decision would single-handedly change the history of e-commerce,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,200
publishing, film, TV,  journalism,

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,099
and quite possibly interstellar travel.

7
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:22,960
That decision also represents a recurring
theme in his life:

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,619
Never settle.

9
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:25,699
Ever.

10
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,429
This is how Jeff Bezos took a simple idea
into a garage

11
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:31,840
and built one of the largest marketplaces on the planet.

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,710
Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964.

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,560
As a child, he turned his parents’ garage

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,300
into a laboratory for his inventions.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,511
In his 1982 valedictorian speech, he discussed colonizing outer space

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,600
and turning Earth into a giant nature preserve.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,000
Graduating from Princeton with a computer science degree,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,520
instead of going straight into tech,

19
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,300
he had other ideas...

20
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,160
You don’t become a billionaire unless you
have this insatiable desire

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,329
to accrue wealth and power.

22
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,640
But I think he just looks at it in a way that’s

23
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,100
really different to almost anyone else I follow.

24
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,400
That’s Tom Metcalf...

25
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,479
I’m a billionaires reporter for Bloomberg
News.

26
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,270
He’s always driven by success, and Wall
Street was the pinnacle for most graduates.

27
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,780
He was a very mathematical graduate.

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,270
It really fit in his almost quant-like outlook.

29
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,940
He quickly made a name for himself.

30
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,479
At 26, the youngest-ever Vice President of Bankers Trust Company.

31
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,979
At 28, the youngest-ever Senior Vice President of DE Shaw and Co.

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,800
It was there that he discovered a giant, untapped
resource:

33
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,740
the internet.

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,320
He was seeing the internet grow by 2300% a year.

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,180
In all his time at a Wall Street firm,

36
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,660
he’d never seen such a growth opportunity.

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,280
He went through a whole list of industries,

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,540
and, if you think about books,

39
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,039
easy to package. Hard to damage.

40
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,679
And of course the internet offers an infinite
library.

41
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:52,429
DE Shaw did not share his optimism.

42
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:54,360
For the opportunity of a lifetime,

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,240
Bezos would have to leave Wall Street.

44
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,080
Whatever it is that you want to do,

45
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,740
there's gonna be risk in your life.

46
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,470
And risk is a necessary component of progress.

47
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,120
And he quite simply packed his stuff up,

48
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,900
drove across the country.

49
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,080
And the legend goes that, while in the car,

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,240
he was writing the business plans.

51
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,520
Setting up shop in his garage, in 1994,

52
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,800
he incorporated his book company under the name….

53
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,020
“Cadabra”.

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,700
It wasn’t great when a lawyer misheard it
as “cadaver”.

55
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,700
He ultimately landed on “Amazon” for a
couple reasons.

56
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,440
Firstly, the name beginning with ‘A’

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,100
would likely be on top of any alphabetized web search.

58
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,380
And he kind of liked the fact that it tied
into the world’s largest river,

59
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,690
and he was setting up plans to make Amazon the world’s largest company.

60
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,440
Launching in July 1995,

61
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,860
a bell was installed to ring

62
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,170
every time a book was sold.

63
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,418
In its first month, Amazon sold to people

64
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:45,830
in all 50 states and 45 different countries.

65
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,340
The bell was gone in weeks.

66
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,340
All their expectations were smashed.

67
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,880
They thought they'd maybe sell dozens of books the first week.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,960
It was in fact hundreds.

69
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Then thousands.

70
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,630
And, of course today, millions.

71
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,140
By September 1995,

72
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,510
Amazon processed $20,000
in monthly sales.

73
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,300
With its 1997 IPO,

74
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,880
Amazon was valued at $400
million.

75
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,160
By 1999, Jeff Bezos was worth $10 billion

76
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,240
and was Time’s Man of the Year.

77
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,240
But soon after, the dot com crash had people
skeptical:

78
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,170
was Amazon a sustainable business,

79
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,760
or would the bubble burst?

80
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,620
Anyone who’s met Bezos knows he’s
extraordinarily charismatic and very convincing.

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,940
In terms of the long-term vision,

82
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,300
he had it mapped out for decades.

83
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,540
Whatever happened in the short term,

84
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,080
he wasn’t going to change that plan.

85
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,880
And I think he conveyed that pretty well

86
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,000
to his stockholders.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,320
With the crash eliminating many competitors,

88
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,470
Amazon strengthened its grip on the market

89
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,110
and expanded beyond books.

90
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,110
The Kindle.

91
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,110
Alexa.

92
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,110
Amazon Studios.

93
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,110
And of course….

94
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,140
Amazon Prime.

95
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,680
What it does is it really locks people into
the Amazon ecosystem.

96
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,030
They’re much more inclined to be buying
a lot more.

97
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,430
Word of mouth spreads.

98
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,080
And that has been the biggest driver of Amazon’s
incredible revenue growth.

99
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,340
Yet, historically, Amazon has seen modest
annual profits.

100
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,140
There’s an enormous amount of cash flowing
through the company.

101
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,180
And what Bezos does - he’s not returning
that to shareholders.

102
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,700
He’s reinvesting that in the company.

103
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,140
For sure in its core businesses,

104
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,319
but also going off for these almost moonshot projects.

105
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,120
My vision for Blue Origin is

106
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,510
millions of people living and working in space.

107
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,000
This is such a game-changer.

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,450
Amazon to buy Whole Foods.

109
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,740
Jeff Bezos is now the richest person in the
world.

110
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,120
$250 million for the storied Washington Post.

111
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,983
His acquisition of the Washington Post not
only raised eyebrows,

112
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:29,430
but put him at odds with another well-known billionaire.

113
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,430
He bought the Washington Post to have political
influence.

114
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,740
If I become President,

115
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,750
oh do they have problems.

116
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,380
They're going to have such problems.

117
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,159
Bezos and Trump are probably as different
as two entrepreneurs can get.

118
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,980
Trump is pretty reactionary, kind of emotional,

119
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,320
whereas Bezos normally doesn’t really respond.

120
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,700
Though once he did suggest

121
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,980
he'd be willing to send Donald Trump into space.

122
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,200
And, you know, I have a rocket company so...

123
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,920
the capability is there.

124
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,640
Few businessmen choose to make an enemy of
a president.

125
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,140
But having built an empire out of a garage,

126
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,060
Jeff Bezos has proven capable

127
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,660
of handling any adversary.

128
00:05:01,660 --> 00:00:00,000
Especially complacency.
