hi I'm Max Keiser welcome to the Kaiser report cream Kaiser report rules everything around me right Stacy yes max well in the second half you talked to Bill Ackman of Mines comm and I've been saving these headlines for him and also in light of the tragedy out in Mountain View or sent out near San Francisco and at YouTube and the sort of craziness going on around social media where we've been you know they've become basically stuck in the middle of this hyper partisan crazy sort of times wherein where both sides the red team and the blue team the Democrats and the Republicans are all trying to demonetised a deep platform the other side and make sure they have no voice no no potential to reach an audience so however now that we're a little bit away from that I want to talk about this headline here regarding the social media and what we're seeing political arguments inside Google have gotten so bad that 100 employees formed a group to stop cyberbullying about 100 Google us employees concerned about cyberbullying inside the company have organized into a group proposing new policies for conduct at the unit of alphabet they said that they want to stop inflammatory conversations and personal attacks on the forms to see punishment for individuals who regularly derail discussions or leaked conversations the group also wants Google to list rights and responsibilities for accusers defendants managers and investigators in human resources case the group also desires greater protection for employees targeted by what its views as insincere complaints to human resources used by bullying tactics and goading so I mean it's quite interesting that they also point out that there were insincere complaints to Human Resources this this weird thing that's going on on all sides where they want to destroy the economic access for the other side based on political opinion like we've been somehow there's no meat there's no price discovery allowed there's no opinion discovery you know in the markets you have price discovery buyers and sellers meat here ideas are supposed to meet in the marketplace and you're supposed to discuss it and have debate and just decide what's the best course of action moving forward away but both sides have somehow we've lost any ability to have any conversation so these troll wars are happening inside the company that's what even inside the company James d'amour you know him he was a conservative he said that he was fired because he was conservative and supported Trump he sued alphabet he said that he was not allowed to speak his mind because everybody there is liberal so this is this kind of triggered the war going on inside the company there's apparently an internal slack or some sort of forum board where they're fighting it people are saying horrible things about each other I don't know the full extent of the conversation like that phrase they're making in sincere complaints to human resources yeah so that tells me that employees are trolling human resources by saying oh such as such an employee is is acting in a way that is illegal or against the rules or bla bla bla is like so they're they're at war there's an internal war going inside the company so therefore we can expect that the people who use the product outside of the company would be involved in a similar war I mean if you have a company and inside the company they're the product the people are getting sick on the product let's say you're are you know a food processor and your employees are getting sick on that food but you're selling the food to the public as well I mean what if you why don't you take your own eat your own dog food is a is a mantra that you hear in corporate Suites all the time you know their own product is is diseases is that a word is a disease within the own their own corporate culture is disintegrating how can the product be allowed into the trade and go outside well my theory looking at this and looking at the past year or so in the United States is this is what a corporate citizen looks like we are not citizens of a democracy anymore in the past one would appeal to your mayor or your local officials or your state officials or your elected national legislators to change things or or you know if if you wanted and to end discriminate against african-americans like the civil rights movement they didn't go appealing to some corporation to like D monetize and D platform that person but you see that we've slowly evolved into sort of you know neo feudal times is you're under whatever corporation and you pledge allegiance to that corporation or your only recourse to basically change the world and the environment around you is to appeal to some corporation Exxon please stop polluting Google please let me upload a video Facebook please let me communicate with my family like it's or the opposite is like you know Facebook I don't like that person's message take them off Facebook and and don't allow them to speak to anybody Fox News I don't like what that person your presenter said so I'm gonna contact everybody who ever advertises on your channel I'm gonna take them down so there's our discourse so this is like corporate discourse now we only we can only appeal to corporate masters right there's corporate masters increasingly are ruled by algorithms exactly on Wall Street they rely on algorithms trading on New York Stock Exchange is run by algorithms so the algorithms that guide the product of Google also guides the actions of the employees within a Google and they can't stop the algorithm isn't this just like Fantasia the Disney movie with Mickey Mouse where he goes to war with the dancing broom and he tries to chop it down and it creates more dancing brooms and he creates the flood within the Wizards palace I mean these are algorithms that are out of frickin control and employees within the company can't stop them they're at war driven by algorithm who's in charge the algorithm or the head of Google who's running the show now well in the case of Facebook some people say Mark Zuckerberg is a robot so they they they're uncertain whether or not he's actually a real human well he was obviously burst by some kind of mutant algorithm that got in to the DNA somehow so I want to turn to Facebook in this next headline and the Cambridge analytic because you know they gathered all the data but Cambridge analytic is getting a lot of the brunt of the ire and the outrage and the media of course but if if there's one Cambridge analytic Affairs one cockroach you know there's thousands of other companies also collecting the same data and there's a harvard business coined the phrase surveillance capitalism that's what we now live in a surveillance capitalism but i'll wind back to what they say is in the wake of the cambridge analytical scandal news articles and commentators have focused on what facebook knows about us a lot it turns out it collects data from our posts our likes our photos things we type and delete without posting and things we do while not on facebook and even when we're offline it buys data about us from others and it can infer even more our sexual orientation political beliefs relationship status drug use and other personality traits even if we didn't take the personality test that cambridge and i lytic a developed so you know these surveillance capitalist corporations have been collecting a lot of data on us that we have mostly provided for free because we were getting a free service of course many especially in the cyberpunk community have warned that there's no such thing as free lunch if you're giving them your data for free of course you are the product that's like calling a crocodile's surveillance capitalists all right crocodile they are quiet in the water waiting and waiting and waiting and then they strike so all the algorithms are in place and these corporate geo tees are in place for an opportunity to make itself apparent and then they predatory jump in and rip to shreds to prey in this case the unsuspecting consumer or voter or citizen who is now being torn to shreds by the crocodile capitalist well they point out this harvard business thing points out that but for every article about facebook's creepy stalker behavior thousands of other companies are breathing a collective sigh of relief that it's Facebook and not them in the spotlight because while Facebook is one of the biggest players in the space there are thousands of other companies that spy on and manipulate us for profit is called surveillance capitalism there are 2,500 to 4,000 data brokers the United States alone Equifax is one of them of course they basically are private company that gives a social credit score to you they collect data on you and tell banks whether or not you're trustworthy and whether or not you should be given access to any credit that's one well-known company but surveillance capitalism takes us one step further companies like Facebook and Google offer you free services in exchange for our data Google's surveillance isn't in the news but it is starting ly intimate we never lie to our search engines our interest and curiosity's hopes and fears desires and sexual proclivities are all collected and saved add to that the websites we visit that Google tracks to its advertising network our Gmail accounts are moving as via Google Maps and what it can collect from our smart phones so what's the difference between Facebook and this new super gonorrhea that's completely resistant to all antibiotics in other words there's no cure for facebook now yes there is it's called delete your account form every the surveillance capitalism and infiltrated every single orifice of our interaction with each other and our interaction with the cyberspace that's super gonorrhea it's called the Dewey Decimal System it's called going to the library and researching in that space again it's getting rid of your smartphone but I mean that's not really probably the 60s they burn their draft cards so you're saying with time to burn our smartphone then be free from well you have a capital a surveillance plague well you have to do it environmentally sound way cuz there's a lot of toxic stuff in there so you can't just burn your phone no because it might be quite dangerous but here I do want to say you know my Google searches if anybody has a blog platform or tries to tweet funny photos like the searches I do to come up you know find some images I think the surveillance capitalist might have a hard time selling to me because I put in some freaky search words well 99% of my searches are for max keiser so it's all very self-reflective of narcissistic you can come spying me all day long and you learn all about me about myself okay well surveillance capitalism drives much of the Internet it is behind most of the three services and many of the paid ones as well is goal is psychological manipulation in the form of personalized advertising to persuade you to bide something or do something like vote for a candidate and while the individualized profile driven manipulation exposed by Cambridge analytical feels abhorrent it's really no different from what every company wants in the end this is why all your personal information is collected and this is why it is so valuable companies that can understand it can use it against you it's gas lighting this gas lighting on an industrial scale they attack the subconscious mind that gets you confused and then they rip you off it should be illegal it's anti-constitutional it's krokodil capitalism it's frickin super gonorrhea from Mark Zuckerberg there's no cure for it no an anti whatever it's called anti not auntie auntie what my son say free speech enter censorship they censure you I myself have not been on Facebook for the last three months simply because we were in Miami I took a photo in which was a Native American artwork behind us and it's not breasts but it's like breasts like figures it looks like there's some breasts in there and they won't let me back on to the platform unless I go through every single photo I've ever uploaded in the past ten years and confirm that each photo is not there is no pornographic imagery in it it's like you know the punk revolution they kick back against all this back in the day all right well don't go away come back after the break I will be blowing your mind welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to turn to bill Ottman of mines a.com bill welcome thanks for having me all right so it's mines M IND Escom that's it all right this is gonna be an interesting kind of look at social media in this day and age of hashtag delete Facebook you provide an alternative with minds.com tell us about your platform what is it when did you build it started in 2011 so I've been going for a while just trying to build something that can actually scale but so it's different in that it's open source anyone can inspect the code share it free software movement which I know you all have covered with Stallman and everything essential like the next major networks have to be free software encrypted so we don't take even personal information we don't require it you earn crypto for your activity on the app this is sort of an emerging trend that people need to be rewarded for their energy on networks okay so start in 2011 and it's following the free open source software movement if you will Foss which goes back to the Richard Stallman and is proselytizing of this as being necessity to encourage best practices on the Internet and now we are in the wake of the huge Facebook meltdown the revelation that all kinds of data has been sold so minds.com number one eye or monetizing folks for their activity which they don't do on these other social platforms so Facebook's making a lot of money at other people's work right so you're compensating people for their work yeah and in addition no ridiculous algorithms that limit people's reach so our news feeds 100% organic so you'll always reach all of your followers I mean it's insane that they thought that that was okay at all to do and then additionally you can so you earn the tokens and then you can boost your content for more views with the tokens that you earn so we're actually trying to get people's voices heard so it's kind of a feedback loop so you can take your tokens that you're earning and invest in yourself yes peak to get a wider reach thinking that you can actually build a better presence and yeah so how's houses how's the growth but you mentioned your you know scaling a project how is the growth doing and how's the growth been in the wake of this Facebook scandal it's pretty good I mean we're around a million users and you know dayley times have doubled I mean all of these things whether it's censorship or surveillance or algorithms or D monetization this just causes people to seek out new platforms right so the privacy is maintained because you don't actually keep the data or you don't we don't require people to identify themselves at all you can be totally anonymous if you want so you can stuff a Brooklyn company it's actually a Connecticut based company but we have our office and okay and so who's the competitor in this space if anybody I mean I consider everyone who's open source and working with crypto to be sort of a collaborator honestly there's there's sort of a movement of networks that are on the same page so yeah you could call them competitors but you know I considered the proprietary surveillance networks to be the real the real competitors so you know like I would say diaspora mastodons steam it these cut types of places are at least involved in the right direction but I mean for instance with steam it I do have some criticisms on like sort of the well economy going on within it but I still think that they're up to good stuff generally right so all you guys together in your space are compared to the let's say the market capitalization of Facebook and others being in the excess of a trillion dollars so if you can just even get 10 or 20 percent of that market you would all your entire sector would grow enormous Lee so you all stand to do very very well if you can move the current population of folks who are accepting the abuse they get at Facebook to not accept the abuse anymore on Facebook and to go to these other platforms yeah we're we're sort of there's also all this regulatory stuff going on with crypto and token rewards right now in the u.s. especially so we're actually on aetherium test net right now just making sure everything works though all the tokens work you can boost with them but we're really trying to prove utility model and make sure that you know we don't get that heat right so the there is now some heat from the regulator's about tokens mhm and so then you mentioned utility token is a carve out of a specific type of token and you guys been around for a while and there is a clear case for you utilize a utility token if you will so how is that going that are you getting dude to have to spend now allocate dollars to legal and it's that a drag in terms of scaling yeah yeah but I mean you know it should be done right because there are a lot of scam icos out there so you know but it needs to be bounced you can't just call everything a security that's ridiculous so you know the sec exists for a reason but they need to also be conscious of you know the market okay so the token on your site is white what's it called mines the mines token and and was there an icy out no right well we're so we're easing into tokens have but we're running on test net to we're so essentially doing air drops every day of tokens for people's contributions so based on your percent contribution to the community and engagement that's the percent daily rewards you get of our pool okay so that is like steam it in to a degree because there's a certain amount of steam it that's kind of released on a regular basis and then people are creating content for some of that steam theirs is more allocated in regards to voting power of an individual so I think the more steam you have the more voting power you have that's not really how it works on mine some minds based on more the raw metrics and engagement you're getting from the whole community everyone's vote is more equal on our system yeah okay so who handles the economics in other words you have a chief economy officer we are definitely talking with big crypto consultants to figure out all the token economics we should have a conversation about it that's what we're doing in this test that we haven't fully decided on the specific token economics because we want it to be as fair as possible we're trying to get all the community feedback to make sure that like the supply and everything is done perfectly remember Yanis varoufakis is the finance minister for greece was before he was doing that role was being a financial consultant for a crypto type of platform that was I can't remember the name I may be my associate producer well whispers in my ear at some point but in other words they brew bringing in a heavyweight economist to try to figure out exactly and all the major economists like Nouriel Roubini and Paul Krugman and the heavyweights the Nobel Prize winners have all uniformly said that crypto and tokens are garbage so I mean how do you get it find a heavyweight in the space that's gonna aside from myself of course who's going to come in and we'll work this all out I mean this whole field of token ah mcc's is like a rapidly emerging field so it I think that there are not really old-school experts on it but there are people who have good insights on what a sort of micro economy would would look like and be make it healthy so you are obviously very concerned about leaking data to outside vendors what do you really apparently some YouTube user won over to YouTube Google and the started shooting up people yeah because they were on she was unhappy about her treatment on the platform what would count what is your reaction because you're in that business what was your first reaction we think yeah that's really scary I mean it's such a sad situation I think that so she was upset about being discriminating against she was upset about her viewcount going down you know these types of issues about being censored I think that what we're doing actually research on this right now that censorship and abuse by these platforms actually amplifies violence and extremism so while Twitter Facebook Google YouTube think that okay we're gonna ban all this speech we're gonna do monetize we're gonna push it off of our platforms okay in the short term that makes you have your nice little safe happy place but you're actually pushing the problem into other places and you're further causing radicalization to occur so you know I think a more mature perspective on it is to you know I take the Darrell Davis approach as this guy who converted like hundreds of members of the KKK an african-american man who befriended them had an honest conversation tried to have the dialogue and they all turned over their ropes like that's the type of mentality that we need with trolls I remember that that story is fascinating yeah but this is you've brought up a very interesting point here so you're saying that an attempt to censor it merely pushes the problem to other platforms and it metastasizes and actually creates a trend toward violence more violence yeah there's actually a number of studies that prove this and so you know it's like when you have you know you push down on one area and it just pops up one another up forget my metal toothpaste tube right yeah got something I'm not a metaphor suddenly oh no but and so so there the problem is one a free speech so in America that was supposed to be built on free speech where did we go wrong I mean I think we're still okay I think America actually has a right the the platforms are starting to not align with that policy right so you feel you're saying that these corporations are not healing closely to the tenants of the US Constitution yeah and it's an understandable knee-jerk reaction I mean you had like hates a lot of this speech is awful and disgusting and there's the violence I mean it's gross but how do you maturely and responsibly deal with that I think that it's just too short-sighted okay you're in the space you're obviously a techno dude let me ask you about 4chan okay 4chan is a collective of meme viewers mhm and they capture the zeitgeist in a way that no one else seems to be able to figure out the Pepe the Frog thing Stroeve Hillary Clinton insane yeah what what are they doing exactly in other words they're they're tapping into the mass psychology in some way that is changing the politics of America in a huge way and you know you're in that business and you when you see 4chan you see what's coming out of 4chan what is what's your thought about it because it seems like they're doing they're performing a vital service because they're distilling all the trolls they're coming up with a distilled troll and then us everyone else to say you know that's it's not an inchoate kind of mass lunacy it's this meme and this meme is now what we're dealing with you know and so we can organize against it I realize it's a rambling question but no I completely understand it's it's there's nuance and extremely dark humor involved in these memes and so I think that the the Kunder standing context and that yet there there are people who understanding the cocktail yeah right at I'm bill thanks bring on the cars report thanks Jaime max well that's gonna do it for this edition of the cars report with me Max Keiser and Stacey her we'd like to thank our guests bill Otteman of minds.com do you want to catch us on social media it's on Twitter at Kaiser report please don't shoot or minds yeah we'll still be on boom bill bill bill I say goodbye already and here you are pumping mics CommVault fair enough until next time bye Oh
