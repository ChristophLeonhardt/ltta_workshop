I MEANT IT NOW.
I APOLOGIZE TO MY FAMILY.
ABBY: A LOT TO UNPACK HERE.
HERE TO DEBATE RNC
SPOKESPERSON KAILEE MCENANY.
FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE 1954
PROJECT.
LADIES, I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS DISCUSSION.
KATIE, START WITH YOU.
WE ALL WATCHED THAT
INTERVIEW PLAY OUT
YESTERDAY.
FIRST HE TALKS ABOUT NOT
NEEDING TO APOLOGIZE TO
MONICA.
AND BASICALLY SAYS WE SHOULD
ALL FEEL SORRY FOR HIM FOR
ALL HE HAS BEEN THROUGH ALL
THESE YEARS.
AND GOES ON TO SAY THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PARTLY TO
BLAME FOR THE COLLATERAL
DAMAGE.
I GUESS TO QUOTE HILLARY
CLINTON'S BOOK TITLE, WHAT
HAPPENED IN THIS INTERVIEW?
>> THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
YOU SEE BILL CLINTON THERE
WHO IS THE POSTER BOY OF THE
ME TOO MOVEMENT.
HE REPRESENTS A GROUP OF
ELITE MEN WHO PREY ON
UNSUSPECTING WOMEN LIKE
22-YEAR-OLD MONICA LEWENSKI.
SHE WAS AN INTERN.
THIS RUINED HER LIFE.
SHE CALLED HERSELF THE MOST
HUMILIATED WOMAN IN THE
WORLD.
IT STALLED HER LIFE FOR
DECADES.
SHE CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE.
JUMPING OFF A BALCONY IT
DESTROYED HER.
AND FOR BILL CLINTON TO SIT
THERE, AN EGOTISTICALLY
CLAIMED
HEAIMED
HELOMED
HELOSTD
HELOST $16 MILLION WHEN
HELOST $16 MILLION SHEN
HELOST $16 MILLION SHE LOST
PART OF HER LIFE.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
TO CLAIM HE IS ARE THE PA OF
THE ME TOO MOVEMENT IT'S AN
INSULT TO WOMEN.
ABBY: BILL CLINTON USED TO
BE THE MOST POPULAR
POLITICIAN IN THE WORLD.
HE WAS KNOWN FOR ABILITY TO
CONNECT WITH PEOPLE.
HIS EMPATHY.
HE GOES ON LAST NIGHT TO SAY
HE WAS THROWN OFF BY THAT
QUESTION.
IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO
HANDLE AN INTERVIEW AND
HANDLE A SIMPLE QUESTION
LIKE THAT.
IT WOULD BE BILL CLINTON.
HOW DOES ANYONE DEFEND IT?
>> I AGREE THERE YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN'T DEFEND THE
INDEFENSIBLE.
HE WENT AHEAD AND HE SAID
THAT HE GOT HOT UNDER THE
COLLAR ANSWERED BASICALLY
WHAT HE SAYS.
HE KNOWS WHAT HE SAID ON THE
LEFT OR RIGHT SIDE OF THE
AISLE HIS COMMENTS ARE
SOMETHING THAT REALLY GOT
PEOPLE IN AN UPROAR.
WHAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
HERE IS WHEN IT COMES TO
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ISSUES OF
THIS NATURE, IT'S NOT
POLITICAL ISSUE.
AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT
CAILEE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF
UNDER THE COLLAR AROUND
CLINTON'S COMMENTS.
LET'S KEEP IN MIND THAT WE
CURRENTLY HAVE SOMEONE
SITTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE
1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE WHO
HAS ACCUSERS WHO SAY THE
SAME THING.
SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.
ABBY: YOU ARE DOING EXACTLY
WHAT BILL CLINTON DID IN
THAT INTERVIEW.
>> NO I'M NOT.
DON'T DO THAT ABBY.
I'M NOT -- THAT'S RUDE.
ABBY: EVERY TIME WE HAVE YOU
ON THE SHOW YOU TURN IT BACK
TO DONALD TRUMP.
IN THIS CONVERSATION AND
THAT INTERVIEW THAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY ON "THE TODAY
SHOW" WITH BILL CLINTON
HIMSELF, THAT HAD NOTHING TO
DO WITH DONALD TRUMP.
THAT HAD TO DO WITH BILL
CLINTON'S PAST AND WHETHER
OR NOT HE FELT HE NEEDED TO
PERSONALLY APOLOGIZE TO
MONICA LEWENSKI.
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
DONALD TRUMP HERE.
WHEN YOU GO THAT DIRECTION
THAT IS WHAT TURNS A LOT OF
PEOPLE OFF.
KAYLEIGH, WHY DOES IT ALWAYS
GO BACK TO DONALD TRUMP.
>> RIDICULOUS TO TRY TO DRAW
AN ANALYSIS BETWEEN BILL
CLINTON WHO OVAL OFFICE AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WORDS IS
ASTONISHING.
SO-CALLED ACCUSERS BY THE
WAY JOHN SOLOMON AT THE HILL
REPORTED WERE PAID OFF BY
GLORIA ALL RED.
ONE HAD HER MORTGAGE PAID
OFF.
ANOTHER ONE OFFERED PAYMENTS
FROM A TABLOID.
TO SAY DRAW AN ANALOGY
BETWEEN WHAT WAS A PUBLICITY
STUNT AND THE SERIOUS
ALLEGATIONS BY JUANITA
BRODERICK AND PAULA JONES
AND MONICA LEWENSKI WHO
ALMOST JUMPED OFF OF A
BALCONY BECAUSE OF WHAT BILL
CLINTON DID TO HER IN THE
OVAL OFFICE, NOT AN ANALOGY
THERE WE SHOULD ALL SIT HERE
AND CONDEMN BILL CLINTON FOR
THOSE ACTIONS.
ABBY: WENTY, THE REASON I'M
FIRED UP BY THE WAY IS
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL WOMEN IN
THIS CONVERSATION.
THE INTERVIEW THAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO
WITH DONALD TRUMP, IT HAD TO
DO WITH BILL CLINTON THAT'S
WHY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
THIS.
CAN'T WE AS WOMEN TAKE
POLITICS OUT OF THIS AND SAY
HE COULD HAVE COME UP WITH A
MUCH BETTER, MUCH MORE HEART
FELT RESPONSE TO THAT
QUESTION?
>> ABBY, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
SO FOR YOU AGAIN TO SIT HERE
AND SAY THAT SOUNDED LIKE
BILL CLINTON IS OFFENSIVE.
NO MATTER WHAT SIDE OF THE
AISLE YOU SIT ON WHAT
CLINTON SAID WAS INCORRECT.
HOWEVER, IN THE SAME TOKEN,
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WAS
ACCUSED BY WOMEN OF DOING
THE SAME THING, SO THIS IS
NOT A POLITICAL ISSUE.
CLINTON IS WRONG.
THAT IS INDEFENSIBLE.
NO ONE IS SAYING THAT HE IS
NOT.
BUT FOR US TO SIT HERE AND
SAY WE ARE GOING TO PIECE
AND PARS MEAL WHAT IS GOING
ON IN THE PAST VERSUS WHAT'S
CURRENTLY GOING ON
COMPLETELY AS WOMEN NOT
DOING JUSTICE TO THE ME TOO
MOVEMENT.
ANYONE WHO SAYS THAT SHOULD
BE ASHAMED.
ABBY: I DON'T THINK THAT'S
WHAT THIS CONVERSATION IS
ABOUT AT ALL.
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE
THAT THAT RESPONSE YESTERDAY
WAS APPALLING AND
EMBARRASSING FOR BILL
CLINTON AND WE WILL SEE HOW
