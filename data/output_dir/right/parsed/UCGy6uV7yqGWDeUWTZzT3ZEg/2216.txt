being here in South Africa there's three
really strong things you realize these
farmers believe in they believe in the
land they believe in their God and they
really believe in the strong women that
stand behind them the women who are
raped who are battered women who work in
schools where children are raped on a
regular basis these strong women I so
admire them and they really made me
realized that Western feminists are just
so disappointed
as you can see I'm being well looked
after here in South Africa but if you
can help us with the costs of security
donate now at Hopkins WorldCom
