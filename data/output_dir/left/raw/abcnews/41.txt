00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:19,091

189
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,660
I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE GOING TO 

190
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,529

191
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,497

BUT I'M GOING TO SAY THEM 

193
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:26,999
ANYWAY.

194
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,034
YOU NEED TO RESPECT THE PRIVACY 

195
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:30,202
OF THESE FAMILIES.

196
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,971
THESE FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH

197
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,973
THE MOST HORRIFIC TIME ENTHEIR 

198
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:36,542

199
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,978
WANT TO TALK TO YOU, RESPECT 

200
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,914
THEM, DON'T MOVE FORWARD WITH 

201
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,850
YOUR CAMERA, YOUR MICROPHONE.

202
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,986
LET THESE FAMILIES HEAL, PLEASE 

203
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:48,721
HONOR THEM.

204
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,390
MANY HAVE CALLED ME AND ASKED ME

205
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,225
TO TRANSFER THIS MESSAGE AND I 

206
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,795
HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER LISTENING.

207
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,797
SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT.

208
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,832
PLEASE RESPECT THESE FAMILIES.

209
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,199
THEY LOST CHILDREN.

210
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:02,802
THEY LOST LOVED ONES.

211
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,604
COULD YOU IMAGINE WHAT THEY'RE 

212
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:06,138
GOING THROUGH?

213
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,540
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

214
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,011
ANY QUESTIONS?

215
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,848
>> DID HE BELONG TO A WHITE 

216
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:16,514
NATIONALIST GROUP -- 

217
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:18,784
>> WE'VE HEARD THAT, WE'RE 

218
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,985
LOOKING INTO THAT.

219
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:24,190
AND WE'LL JUST KEEP FOLLOWING 

220
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:24,356
ON.

221
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:24,790
>> [ INAUDIBLE ]. 

222
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,224
>> HE MIGHT HAVE.

223
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:31,797
I DON'T KNOW AT THIS TIME.

224
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:36,635
>> HOW DOES THAT FIT IN THE 

225
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:36,902
NARRATIVE?

226
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,338
>> IT FITS IN PERFECTLY.

227
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,140
HE COULD HAVE SHOT THEM, HE 

228
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,742
COULD HAVE BEEN WITHIN THE 

229
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,376
SCHOOL, THEY COULD HAVE BEEN 

230
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:44,643
OUTSIDE.

231
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:46,578
THIS IS A POWERFUL RIFLE AND 

232
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,114
COULD HAVE EASILY GONE THROUGH A

233
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,383
DOOR OR SHOT WHILE THE DOOR WAS 

234
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:51,583
OPEN.

235
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,286
SO WE'RE STILL EXAMINING VIDEO.

236
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,587
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

237
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:57,790
IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE ASKED 

238
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,057
OURSELVES.

239
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,359
WITHIN A DAY OR TWO WE'LL HAVE 

240
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:09,568
THE EXACT ANSWER FOR THAT.

241
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:13,439
>> IT CERTAINLY COULD.

242
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,875
>> YES.

243
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,343
HE BROUGHT A WEAPON IN CARL 

244
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,579

245
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:27,586
SUNRISE TACTICAL.

246
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:31,190
I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT RELEASING 

247
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,691
ANY VIDEO.

248
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,860
WE MIGHT RELEASE INFORMATION 

249
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,363
I'LL CAPTURE OR RECOVER FROM THE

250
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,464
VIDEO.

251
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,833
BUT AT THIS TIME I HAVE NO PLANS

252
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,434
TO RELEASE ANY TYPE OF 

253
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:43,536
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.

254
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:53,345

00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,852
SUPERINTENDANT AND THEN I'LL 

257
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,487
COME BACK TO THE MICROPHONE.

258
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,122

HORRIFIC SITUATION.

266
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,878
WE CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH.

267
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,947
IF YOU COULD HONOR THEM AND 

268
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,048
RESPECT THEM DURING THESE 

269
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:31,250
CRITICAL TIMES.

270
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,852

>> THAT'S WHAT OUR DETECTIVES 

297
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:32,678

DID WHAT HE DID.

326
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:39,411

CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING MORE 

334
00:14:58,263 --> 00:14:59,198

HAD ON A MASK AT ANY TIME.

340
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,745
>> -- FEAR OF THE TEACHERS HE 

341
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,280
MIGHT BRING A WEAPON IN THE

394
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,608
THIS IS A SCHOOL THAT HAD HAD 

395
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:26,878
JUST DONE DRILLS AND HAD A FIRE 

396
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,146
ALARM EARLIER IN THE DAY.

397
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:30,449
IT'S BELIEVED THAT SECOND FIRE 

398
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,851
ALARM WADS TRIGGERED BY THE 

399
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:33,118
SUSPECT.

400
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,719
AND DOWN HERE IN FLORIDA 

401
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,555
COVERING THIS FROM THE START FOR

402
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:36,755
US.

403
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,990
WE KNOW NIKOLAS CRUZ WAS IN 

404
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,059
COURT TODAY AND WE LEARNED QUITE

405
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,595
A BIT NOT ONLY FROM HOW FEW 

406
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,431
WORDS HE SPOKE BUT FROM THE 

407
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:47,966
AFFIDAVIT OF HIS COURT 

408
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:48,333
APPEARANCE.

409
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:48,466
.

410
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,735
>> ACCORDING TO AN AFFIDAVIT, 

411
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:52,737
WE'VE SEEN THAT ACCORDING TO 

412
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:54,239
INVESTIGATORS AFTER HE WAS READ 

413
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,075
HIS MIRANDA RIGHTS ONCE HE WAS 

414
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:59,010
ARRESTED HE ALLEGEDLY CONFESSED 

415
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,779
TO KILLING ALL 17 OF THOSE 

416
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:01,813
PEOPLE AT THAT HIGH SCHOOL.

417
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:04,416
AS YOU MENTIONED TODAY WE DID 

418
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,352
SEE HIM HAD IN COURT EARLIER.

419
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,087
WE LEARNED FROM HIS ATTORNEY 

420
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,390
THAT HE IS NOW ON SUICIDE WATCH.

421
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,926
SO HE'S BEING MONITORED VERY 

422
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,060
CLOSELY BY POLICE.

423
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,995
EARLIER TODAY I WENT TO THE 

424
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,363
NEIGHBORHOOD IN SOUTH FLORIDA 

425
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,031
WHERE HE SPENT MORE THAN 10 

426
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,101
YEARS AND IT'S A VERY NORMAL 

427
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:23,434
NEIGHBORHOOD.

428
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:24,836
BUT NEIGHBOR AFTER NEIGHBOR SAID

429
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:27,672
THE ONE THING THAT WAS ABNORMAL 

430
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:30,509
WAS NICKEROUS RR CRUZ.

431
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,776
A VERY NICE NEIGHBORHOOD.

432
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:34,179
BUT ONE NEIGHBOR WHO LIVED JUST 

433
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,881
A FEW DOORS DOWN WHO GREW UP 

434
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:40,252
WITH NIKOLAS CRUZ, A TEENAGER 

435
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,687
TOLD ME HE DESCRIBED NIKOLAS 

436
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,956
THIS WAY AGGRESSIVE, CRAZY, 

437
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:46,658
WEIRD, A PSYCHO.

438
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:50,862
AS A LITTLE BOY HE CORNERED A 

439
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:51,529
SQUIRREL AND WAS TRYING TO KILL 

440
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:52,764
IT WITH ROCKS.

441
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,433
ANOTHER NEIGHBOR TOLD ME HE 

442
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,002
WOULD TAKE A PELLET GUN AND TRY 

443
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:01,272
TO KILL CHICKENS.

444
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:03,408
HE WOULD ROAM THE STREETS IN A 

445
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,710
CAMOUFLAGE JACKET FROM A CHILD 

446
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,512
TO HIS TEEN AGE YEARS.

447
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:09,848
HE ALWAYS STOOD OUT.

448
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,617
THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING JUST 

449
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:14,052
OFF ABOUT HIM. 

450
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,721
>> Reporter: THERE SEEMS TO BE 

451
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:18,256
SO MANY TROUBLING WARNING SIGNS 

452
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:19,224
ALONG THE WAY.

453
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,727
LOST HIS FATHER EARLY, LOST HIS 

454
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:24,663

455
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:24,863

456
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,965
A LOT OF TRAUMA LEADING TO ALL 

457
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,800
OF THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT WARNING

458
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,302
SIGNS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 

459
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,603
MISSED ALONG THE WAY.

460
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,438
YOU HEARD THE SHERIFF SAY 

461
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,507
MOMENTS AGO THAT THIS WEAPON WAS

00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,309
BOUGHT HERE IN FLORIDA LEGALLY 

463
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,976
IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO.

464
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:40,278

CONFIRMED OUT RIGHT THAT HE 

470
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,057
BOUGHT THAT GUN LEGALLY AT A GUN

471
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,759
STORE IN BROWARD COUNTY.

00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,429
SPEAK OF, BOUGHT IT GUN AND WAS 

474
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,565
ABLE TO DO ALL THAT CARNAGE, 

475
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:00,866
DAVID.

476
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,001

HEALTH ISSUES IN THE PAST.

479

GUNS.

480
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,752

481
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,087
QUESTION ABOUT GUN CONTROL IF

NOW IS THE TIME TO START TALKING

483
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:24,389
ABOUT THAT.

484
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,990
MENTAL HEALTH SEEMS TO BE THE 

485
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,359
FOCUS FOR THIS PRESIDENT, RATHER

486
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,929
AT THIS HOUR.

487
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,397
HE IS CALLING THE SHOOTER 

488
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,197
MENTALLY DISTURBED.

WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

490
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,434

00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:38,570
TEXAS, IT'S UNCLEAR WHEN, IT

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,205

495
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,809
BUT WHILE THE PRESIDENT IS NOT
