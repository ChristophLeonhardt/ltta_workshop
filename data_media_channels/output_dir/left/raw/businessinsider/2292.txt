1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,070
so keep tell us about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> European call</font>

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,780
you made a big call on Spain you say

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,520
it's unraveling you say that in fact

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,200
there's a lot more where that came from

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,969
with other<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries yeah last week we</font>

6
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:15,559
held a conference called basically

7
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:17,090
saying are you bearish enough on Spain

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,320
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer obviously the</font>

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,330
presentation was implied and that no

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,130
we're not because big debt maturities

11
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,750
start to come due in Spain in June and

12
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way that we've looked at Europe</font>

13
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,720
overall is just in terms of the sequence

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,759
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the debt maturities now there's no</font>

15
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:30,619
irony that Greece had their big debt

16
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:32,090
maturities on May nineteenth and it was

17
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,800
the focus country first so<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we go to</font>

18
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,390
Spain next and then after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

19
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,980
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to France and Italy and we</font>

20
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that that's kind of how Europe</font>

21
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">lays out in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the US which</font>

22
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:41,840
we'll talk about in another<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment you</font>

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,969
got a nice thesis about that as well but

24
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:47,600
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to Europe a week ago we</font>

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,640
were told this problem was solved right

26
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,010
the ECB came in huge guarantee trillion

27
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,020
dollars the market went up and euphoric

28
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,239
celebration not the case no and I think

29
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,680
that you know if anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> we haven't</font>

30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,329
which is frightening we haven't learned

31
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:01,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the lesson</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that Hank Paulson taught us</font>

32
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,600
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the bazooka actually didn't</font>

33
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,640
work so you come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a few these</font>

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys we call them the Fiat fools you</font>

35
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,520
know jean-claude<font color="#CCCCCC"> trichet and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ben</font>

36
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bernanke is the same thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you cannot</font>

37
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,420
create money out of thin air<font color="#CCCCCC"> piled debt</font>

38
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,790
upon debt upon debt and actually have an

39
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,110
estimate that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to turn out</font>

40
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,030
well in the end so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

41
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,470
that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> trillion dollar program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

42
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,970
Europe does anything but devalue their

43
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,040
currency and put more risk on to the

44
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,990
citizenry who basically gets imported

45
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,180
inflation as a result so I think that

46
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,490
Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner would say

47
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,170
no holy no wait a minute our program

48
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,240
worked incredibly well so let's just

49
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,820
duplicate it yeah so well from these

50
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at we live in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> culture</font>

51
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,479
where everything's about you evaluated

52
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,100
and validated by stock markets as

53
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,509
opposed to currencies you know

54
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,549
populations health you look at

55
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">unemployment levels so we have that Fiat</font>

56
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,079
fool mentality here in the US and I

57
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,030
think that it's permeated into Europe

58
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,439
now don't forget the tree<font color="#E5E5E5"> che was also</font>

59
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,880
the finance minister of france of all

60
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,770
places where there you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the</font>

61
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,619
that's what they do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font>

62
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,450
experiment has been to a lower high in

63
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,789
the sp500<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give them a golf clap for</font>

64
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,590
that but from here on in like if you

65
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,119
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the markets today it doesn't</font>

66
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the experiment you know plays</font>

67
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,690
out for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long term successfully so</font>

68
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,580
what do you think happens in<font color="#CCCCCC"> europe</font>

69
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,020
maybe we come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> with even more</font>

70
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,220
guarantees

71
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,710
and more loans more<font color="#E5E5E5"> backstopping and</font>

72
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,480
then eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we continue to fail or</font>

73
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,100
as the market learned its lesson and

74
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,270
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to go down from here</font>

75
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">now well it the only way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the system</font>

76
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,990
to finally correct is to get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

77
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,640
government's you know particularly the

78
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,680
people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are maneuvering these</font>

79
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">governments that's the problem of Fiat</font>

80
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,370
fools they legitimately believed like

81
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,350
Cannes did that government is the answer

82
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,880
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything now I don't agree with</font>

83
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,350
that and Hayek didn't agree with that

84
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,820
either there are a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font>

85
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,140
believe that markets should<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear at a</font>

86
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,850
price<font color="#E5E5E5"> and every time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you come in with</font>

87
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,620
these big bazookas of European you know

88
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,510
elixirs or whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they are</font>

89
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,740
they're going to try it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and</font>

90
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,760
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the reaction as</font>

91
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,620
equally as negative and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

92
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,580
know you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically see</font>

93
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,950
government's get fired<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in the US</font>

94
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,050
market there seemed to be for a while a

95
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,300
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> ending which had us all we all</font>

96
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,040
forgot the crash it was just a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

97
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,230
bad months is the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing likely to</font>

98
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,970
happen in Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> will we get this</font>

99
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,950
euphoric recovery at some point everyone

100
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,780
say we're off to the races again no

101
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,459
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crash first I mean we've</font>

102
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,200
crashed in Spain like as<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this morning</font>

103
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,459
you're down twenty six percent year

104
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">today crash being twenty percent or more</font>

105
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,140
obviously Greece's crash next France is

106
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,150
crashing and Italy's crashing and what's

107
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,650
the timetable for those we've said this

108
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,540
basically you know this quarter we think

109
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,830
France is going to be on the fast track

110
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> crashing and last night Berlusconi in</font>

111
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,730
Italy admitted that he needs to cut the

112
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,650
deficit so he's on the fast track now

113
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,060
these markets are within five to ten

114
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,950
percent of actual crashes the big ones

115
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,230
france and italy both of them France in

116
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,870
particular a<font color="#CCCCCC"> triple-a rating absolutely</font>

117
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,459
nonsensical for a country that's headed

118
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,680
towards a deficit to gdp ratio of ten

119
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,019
percent so that's happening real time as

120
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:43,880
you see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so how does it play out</font>

121
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,769
over the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of years I think</font>

122
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:47,330
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see crashes in equities</font>

123
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,680
you know in all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these countries like</font>

124
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,760
you've seen what you've seen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greece</font>

125
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,560
is kind of like a metaphor like Bear

126
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,299
Stearns was and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

127
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,160
pundits and the savants come out and say

128
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,170
hey look now this is just contained it

129
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,299
hardly looks contained to me today it's

130
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:00,590
spreading to Asia you know different

131
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,730
governments and don't you know with

132
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,230
different balance sheet problems are

133
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,340
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to have these problems</font>

134
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,049
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that it ends with crashes</font>

135
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:07,910
the removals of governments or at least

136
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,290
the people who are purporting to know

137
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on when they have</font>

138
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,980
no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix this and then will</font>

139
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know try to find a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recover</font>

140
00:04:14,480 --> 00:00:00,000
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thanks cute</font>
