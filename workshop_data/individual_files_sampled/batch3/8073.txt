WE HAVE A LOT TO GET TO TONIGHT. HE'S BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF ALL THIS, LINDSEY GRAHAM. WELCOME, IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK. TO ME THIS IS SERIOUS. WHAT WAS THE DEAL ON FRIDAY? HERE'S THE DEAL. SENATOR FLAKE VOTED YES ON THE COMMITTEE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT SHE WOULD LIKE THE FBI TO INTERVIEW THE 340 WITNESSES THAT WERE INTERVIEWED BY THE REPUBLICAN ON THE COMMITTEE. PJ, MRS. LELAND, AND MARK JUDGE. LISA MURKOWSKI SET OUT THAT THE FBI TO TRY TO CHECK THE COMMITTEE'S HOMEWORK AND BE ALSO AGREED TO INTERVIEW MRS. RAMIREZ WITH THE ALLEGATIONS. Hannity: THAT WAS THE NEW YORKER? RIGHT. IF THEY WON'T FURTHER INTERVIEW, THEY WILL SIT DOWN WITH SENATOR McCONNELL AND SEE WHAT THEY CAN WORK OUT. THEY HAD A DEAL FOR A WEEK, WE LIMITED THE INTERVIEWS TWO, THREE PEOPLE NAMED BY DR. FORD. WE WILL SEE WITH THE FBI FINDS. Hannity: IT IS NOW BEEN EXPANDED OUT? THE PRESIDENT SAID. NO IT IS NOT. THIS IS A REQUEST OUT OF SIGNAGE. NOBODY ASKED TO DO THIS. NOBODY ASKED FOR THAT. NOT ONE DEMOCRAT ASKED THE QUESTION. THE SENATORS ENGLISH AND DID NOT FEEL THAT WAS NECESSARY. IT MAKES NO SENSE LET ME GO OVER IT AGAIN. THE DOCTOR FORD WITNESSES, MARK JUDGE, LELAND, AND PJ. AND MRS. RAMIREZ. THAT SAID, DO IT WITHIN A WEEK, REPORT BACK TO THE SENATE AND WILL MOVE FORWARD. NBC NEWS JUST RAN THIS INTERVIEW. Hannity: NOT ONLY WAS ONE PERSON TO HEADSET, SHE CHANGED THE STORY. SHE WAS SAYING THAT IT WAS SYSTEMATICALLY EVERY WEEKEND. WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS. WHAT REASONABLE PERSON WOULD GO TO A PARTY, WITNESS DRUGGING OF WOMEN, GANG RAPE AND GO BACK. I NEVER TELL ANYBODY. Hannity: AND NOW SHE IS SAYING, SAID THAT HE PUT IT IN THE PUNCH. HE WAS NEAR THE PUNCH. WHAT IS NBC RUN THIS? THERE WAS AN ANONYMOUS LETTER RECEIVED BY CORY GARDNER, THE SENATOR FROM COLORADO WITH NO RETURN ADDRESS, JUST A LETTER. IT ACCUSED BRETT KAVANAUGH OF ASSAULTING SOMEBODY IN A RESTAURANT IN 1998 IN COLORADO. CORY HANDED TO THE COMMITTEE AND SOMEBODY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE LEAKED THAT A LETTER. I GOT ON THE NBC NIGHTLY NEWS. THE FOURTH ALLEGATION. Hannity: THE FIFTH AND RHODE ISLAND. TO THINK NBC WOULD HAVE DONE THAT IF IT WAS A DEMOCRATIC MALE NOMINEE? ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THE JOURNALIST INTEGRITY HAS BEEN DESTROYED OVER THIS CASE. Hannity: ALL RIGHT. IT IS A VERY TIGHT MARGIN IN THE SENATE. ANY OF JEFF FLAKE. Hannity: WHO KNOWS WHAT JEFF FLAKE IS SAYING. WHO KNOWS. LET ME ASK YOU THIS, YOU FALL ONE VOTE SHORT. NUMBER ONE, I DON'T THINK WE WILL. I WILL TELL YOU WHY, I DON'T THINK WE WILL FIND ANYTHING NEW FROM THE SUPPLEMENT ON THE FBI INVESTIGATION TO TAKE JEFF FROM YES, TO KNOW. I THINK THE TWO SENATORS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FBI DID THEIR HOMEWORK, THEY CHECKED THE COMMITTEE'S WORK. BUT HER WORK WAS GOOD. I THINK THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. WE'RE NOT EXPANDING AT ALL THIS CRAZY STUFF. NOW, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMETHING REALLY WEIRD DID OCCUR. WE ARE ONE VOTE SHORT. HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO, I WOULD APPEAL THE VERDICT TO THE BALLOT BOX. THIS GOOD MAN SHOULD NOT BE DESTROYED IF YOU LEGITIMIZE THIS PROCESS BY ONE VOTE SHORT. WE WILL BE ON TO THE NEXT PERSON. I WOULD HATE TO BE THE NEXT PERSON NOMINATED. I WOULD FEEL HORRIBLE THAT WE DESTROYED BRETT KAVANAUGH. WHAT WOULD I DO? I WOULD RENOMINATE HIM AND I WOULD TAKE THIS CASE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND VOTERS IN INDIANA AND MISSOURI AND NORTH DAKOTA AND OTHER PLACES WHERE TRUMP ONE SAYING WHO HE WOULD NOMINATE IF HE GOT PRESIDENT AND SEE IF VOTERS WANT TO APPEAL THE VERDICT. Hannity: YOU ARE SAYING IF YOU FALL ONE VOTE SHORT, YOU ARE SAYING THAT I WOULD APPEAL THE CASE. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD RENOMIN THE PRESIDENT SHOULD RENOMIT FOR THIS ELECTION? THE PRESIDENT SHOULD RENOMI? ONE YOU WOULD BE LEGITIMIZING DESTRUCTION OF A HORRIBLE PERSON, I MEAN A HORRIBLE PROCESS AT A GOOD PROP MIKE PERSON. Hannity: THIS WOULD BE A REFERENDUM? THIS WOULD BE AN APPEAL FROM A POLITICAL BODY TO THE PEOPLE WHO PUT US HERE AND SEE IF THESE TRUMP STATES THAT ELECTED PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT HE IS DOING ON CUTTING TAXES. IF THEY ARE OKAY WITH THE DECISION OF THEIR SENATOR, I DON'T THINK WE WILL GET THERE. I THINK WE WILL GET 50 PLUS BUT IF WE FELL ONE VOTE SHORT FOR THE GOOD OF THE NATION, I WOULD
