1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
something that is so commonly discussed

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,279
in society<font color="#CCCCCC"> today is what place science</font>

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,039
and religion has but it's often<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in</font>

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">a way that puts them at polar opposites</font>

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,040
of one spectrum<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's religion vs science</font>

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,079
and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find very</font>

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,630
unhelpful I mean yes I agree there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,090
sometimes confliction 'he's but these

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,859
are confliction that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i feel can be</font>

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,990
resolved through rationality through

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,539
empathy and through common sense it was

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">only recently that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> posted a video</font>

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,199
explaining the universal solutions

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,600
project that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have created basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,850
think that by creating an online

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,579
database that provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> people solutions</font>

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to their problems based on research not</font>

18
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,070
political opinion that's surely a good

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,719
thing there can't be many detrimental

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,059
things because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it yet there are</font>

21
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,219
people who are fundamentalists in their

22
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,899
own religions who call me<font color="#E5E5E5"> an atheist</font>

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,420
which just shows my argument that

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,129
opinions aren't always helpful and

25
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,379
aren't always true so to help me

26
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,600
communicate what place I believe

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,550
religion and science has in society I

28
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,709
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little model that I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

29
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,350
try and explain to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's imagine</font>

30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,070
there is a very religious person who has

31
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,560
a dying relative it was currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,540
hospital being looked after by an

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,150
atheist doctor<font color="#E5E5E5"> after some very tough and</font>

34
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,759
emotional weeks and months it turns out

35
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,159
that this patient fully<font color="#E5E5E5"> recovered and is</font>

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,080
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer dying so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question then</font>

37
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">becomes who is responsible for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">person being brought back to full health</font>

39
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,560
was it the religious person with their

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,290
endless praying to God<font color="#CCCCCC"> or was it the</font>

41
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,420
doctor<font color="#CCCCCC"> who was an atheist who spent</font>

42
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,790
endless hours of hard work trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

43
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,920
find whatever he could to heal this

44
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,909
person what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think the answer is</font>

45
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:47,700
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know my thought my answers this</font>

46
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,560
question is it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter because</font>

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">whether the person was praying endlessly</font>

48
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,020
or the doctor was doing constant amounts

49
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,630
of hard work they were not conflicting

50
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,020
with each other they can both do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

51
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,969
thankfully this person has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought</font>

52
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,890
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> full health there could have</font>

53
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> situation in which a doctor</font>

54
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,429
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had faith and a religious</font>

55
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,169
belief that allowed him to have the hope

56
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,480
to keep going and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not giving up on this</font>

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,000
end of

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,950
I appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> this example is very</font>

59
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,990
simplistic but I think it's one that

60
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,730
when we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it we realized that</font>

61
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,560
religion and science can work

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,660
hand-in-hand you hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> people all the</font>

63
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,680
time who are putting down

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,780
fundamentalists for being radical with

65
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,150
their views whilst it could be said that

66
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,610
atheists are sometimes just as arrogant

67
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,070
and such as patronizing to other people

68
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,170
without thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their feelings</font>

69
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,150
what I'm trying to say is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

70
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,280
scientists and religious people who can

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,920
be just as good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bad as each other</font>

72
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,860
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are circumstances in society</font>

73
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,020
where we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a real debate</font>

74
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,390
about ethics and morals with particular

75
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,790
situations there was once a story of a

76
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,320
very young boy<font color="#E5E5E5"> who refused a blood</font>

77
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,239
transfusion in hospital and therefore

78
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,459
died only<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of the teachings of</font>

79
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:58,840
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it gets</font>

80
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,330
difficult we have to discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> at what</font>

81
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,459
point do we allow people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to practice</font>

82
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">their religion and when do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

83
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:09,010
regard something<font color="#CCCCCC"> as completely insane so</font>

84
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,540
I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> the final question I have is</font>

85
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,370
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you believe science and morality</font>

86
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,890
can never work together at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all times</font>

87
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,140
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously very difficult</font>

88
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,209
issues and even looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the universe</font>

89
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:20,860
of solutions project this has been a

90
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,780
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thrown</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my way on</font>

91
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,170
radio interviews quite a lot and I just

92
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,790
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give an example let's take</font>

93
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,370
abortion a very controversial issue and

94
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is is the science of</font>

95
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,680
abortion legitimate is it something that

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,709
should be allowed to occur and all I say

97
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,019
is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> notion of abortion is a</font>

98
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,180
reactive measure to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem an</font>

99
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">unwanted pregnancy and ever i believe by</font>

100
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,239
actually implementing things through

101
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:51,250
education better science<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better</font>

102
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,019
contraception<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you therefore</font>

103
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,390
eradicate the need to have abortion in

104
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because let's be honest</font>

105
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,810
here there are two sides of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the argument</font>

106
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are pro-life and</font>

107
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,769
there are people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are pro-choice but</font>

108
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,290
both sides<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the argument would both</font>

109
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,660
agree it would be a much better world if

110
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,329
abortions ever had to exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> so free the</font>

111
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:13,810
use of science and through education we

112
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,149
can hopefully eradicate the need of it

113
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,459
ever to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously that is an</font>

114
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,839
absolute and something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be</font>

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,180
deemed impossible but<font color="#E5E5E5"> like anything in</font>

116
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,729
life it is a sliding scale so science

117
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,170
morality and

118
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,330
religion are these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can truly</font>

119
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,270
coexist in a civilized society or is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

120
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,380
something that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> always be</font>

problematic hi everyone how's it going
