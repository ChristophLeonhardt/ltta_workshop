money power politics and today we are keeping an eye on one man one company Tesla the Securities and Exchange Commission's settled with Tesla CEO Elon Musk over the weekend on charges stemming from Musk's tweet in August about taking the company private the settlement calls for a 20 million dollar fine from both Tesla and Elon Musk in addition musk will step down as chairman for three years but he remains CEO and two new independent directors will be brought on to the Tesla Board and oversight will be required for all written communications from musk including tweets Felix Hammond back with me okey doke first is this a good move for Tesla I mean everyone could say this is a massive fine it's not a massive funds miniscule Elon Musk is worth billions and billions of dollars he can blow his nose with 20 20 million bucks Tesla's worth fifty sixty billion dollars Elon Musk's with twenty billion dollars so ya define is nothing define doubled by the way he turned down the opportunity to pay a ten million dollar fine so then the SEC sued him and then he settled for twenty million but it's all pocket changed okay but here's what people don't understand Tesla is worth what did you say 60 billion ish sixty billion dollars and an Elon Musk is saying to employees get excited guys we may be about to turn a profit Tesla has never made okay the average person out there can you speak to the absurdity the perverseness of that because people who everybody loves those Tesla's they don't make money he hasn't been able to build cars this is the problem he's made almost no cars over the 10 years or so that Tesla's been in existence he's lost money lost money lost money he's kept on plummeting profitability just around the corner promising new models promising ramped up production and every time he makes a profit I mean every time he makes a promise he fails to deliver on it so what could this promise or this hint even to employees be based on even before he sent out the incorrectly enraged tweet going private 420 before he then went on a podcast in California smoking weed he was having problems with model 3 production he knew that they were competitors getting cars out there so what could he possibly be speaking of talking out of school is exactly what short sellers go after him yeah he's got this crazy short-term obsession if like trying to get hit targets this week trying to get the stock price up tomorrow this probably explains why he settled with the SEC because he wants the share price to go up he wants to reduce his borrowing costs but he's lost sight of the big picture he's making these decisions like he actually told the SEC that he chose that 420 price because he wanted to impress his girlfriend with a weed joke just think about that for a moment because he wanted to impress his girlfriend with a weed joke then what does this do to musk in terms of being sued be sued by shareholders so there were a lot of lawsuits coming at musk from a million different directions not just shareholders remember there's a cave diver in Thailand who's suing him for libel and slander in both California and London after musk repeatedly called him a pedophile with absolutely no evidence whatsoever musk creates problems all day every day largely through Twitter but also in other ways and it's great that he's stepping down this Chairman and if someone else is going to come in to try and give him modicum of oversight because Tesla needs there but but can oversight actually be put in place there was talk that he would have to step down as CEO but he's not leaving he's standing on a CEO the board is adding two independent directors but it's so stacked with his homeboys including his brother so why would anyone think anything is going to change shareholders are loving it this morning she'll just love it because the FCC's lawsuit has gone away in the SEC lawsuit was the big danger to mask there's probably 10 billion dollars of musk premium in the share price if he goes away then ten billion dollars gets wiped off the branding genius he's a branding genius he is kind of necessary for Tesla to exist but he's also chaos monkey okay but why is he necessary for Tesla to exist if Tesla makes a great product isn't that all that matters medea from the SEC well it's a risk to the company in the brand if he's not there aren't they somehow getting themselves involved in a marketing spoof well right now there's no indication that Tesla has a viable business model as I say it's never once made a penny of profit Elon Musk owners do really like it Tesla owners like if you are lucky enough to have it has led then you almost have me love that Tesla but all of this self-driving capability that he's been talking up for many years is yet to arrive there's not actually indication that self-driving is safer like you said it would be so I feel like Tesla is going to approach those levels a bit like Facebook and other companies where people used to love it and then start mistrusting it but quickly before we go there saying well one big change now the company will have oversight over his tweets this is not the case for almost all CEOs out there I can't think of another company who goes CEO goes fully rogue I mean there's especially public companies they're so careful most CEOs listen to their lawyers the big difference with Elon Musk a bit like it all the time because they don't listen to their lawyers and they just go off and tweet whatever they think and that's never a good idea if you're in that public role my goodness well Elon Musk isn't going anywhere and a story is sure to get more exciting I know we'll be paying attention to that big profitability coming soon hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks
