LONG BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE.

22
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:13,758
YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS WHAT THE

23
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,228
LEFT CAN ACCOMPLISH IN AN

00:01:17,596 --> 00:01:20,698
WHAT THEY CAN'T ACCOMPLISH.

26
00:01:20,699 --> 00:01:22,967
THEY WANT TO IGNORE SEPARATIONS

27
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:27,238
OF POWERS CO-EQUAL BRANCHES AND

28
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,339
THEY WANT THINGS LEGISLATED FROM

29
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,208
THE BENCH.

30
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:33,778
THIS PRESIDENT WANTS TO CHOOSE

31
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:35,479
AN ORIGINALIST.

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,614
GO THROUGH THEIR REACTION TO

33
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:37,782

34
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:38,849
MEANS FOR THE COUNTRY.

35

PROGRESSIVE IDEALOGY ON THE LEFT

38
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,528
IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE

39
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:50,962
CONSTITUTION.

40
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:53,698
THEY TURNED THE SUPREME COURT

41
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:58,369
INTO A ALL-POWERFUL, CENTRALIZED

42
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,103
POLITICAL OPERATION WHERE THEY

43
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:02,673
WANT TO CONTROL A MAJORITY OF

44
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:03,608
THE SEATS.

45
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,509
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT UPHOLDING

46
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,911
THE CONSTITUTION OR TALK THIS

47
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:09,547

00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:10,514
CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION.

49
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:11,782
WHEN YOU HEAR THEM YACK AWAY ON

50
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,584
THE OTHER NETWORKS THEY ARE

51
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:16,988

52
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:17,421
DEMAND.

53
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:19,590
SAME SEX MARRIAGE AND OBAMACARE

54
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:20,391
AND OPEN BORDERS.

55
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:23,394
THEY GIVE YOU THE SAME LEFT WING

56
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:25,963
AGENDA AS IF THEY ARE RUNNING

57
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:27,265
FOR PRESIDENT OR THE SENATE WHAT

58
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:28,532
THEY WANT IN A NOMINEE.

59
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,867
WE DON'T WANT A CONSERVATIVE.

60
00:02:29,868 --> 00:02:31,936
WE DON'T WANT A LIBERAL.

61
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:34,338
WE WANT A CONSTITUTIONALIST.

62
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:39,277
LOOKS AT THE CONSTITUTION AND

63
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:39,910
THE WORDS.

64
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,746
TAKES THEM THIS CONTEXT.

65
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:42,780
TRIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

66
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:44,582
ORIGINAL INTENT WAS AND APPLIES

67
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,149
IT.

68
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,285
THE PARTIES BEFORE THE SUPREME

69
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:48,886
COURT HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT

70
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:50,254
THAT'S WHAT THE JUSTICES WILL

71
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:50,521
DO.

72
00:02:50,522 --> 00:02:51,922
THE DEMOCRATS ARE TELLING THE

73
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:53,424
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

74
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:55,993
IF YOU DON'T NOMINATE RUTH BADER

75
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:57,528
GINSBERG IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER,

76
00:02:57,529 --> 00:03:00,765
WE WILL OPPOSE WHOMEVER YOU

77
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:01,632
NOMINATE.

78
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,100
THE REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE TO

79
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:06,904
STEAM ROLL THE DEMOCRATS.

80
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:09,340
THAT'S OKAY.

81
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:13,544
THE DEMOCRATS DON'T MAKE SENSE.

82
00:03:13,545 --> 00:03:19,150
NOW THEY OPPOSE FILIBUSTERS.

83
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:23,554
NOW THEY OPPOSE IT IN MID-TERM

84
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:24,822
ELECTIONS.

85
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:30,394
FORGET ABOUT SCHUMER AND THE

86
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:30,761
DEMOCRATS.

87
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:33,597
LET US UPHOLD OUR CONSTITUTION.

88
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:35,199
THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS THAT.

89
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,801
HE RAN FOR OFFICE AND HAD

90
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:37,435
A LIST.

91
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:38,169
HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T HAVE

92
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:41,105
FRANKLY.

93
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:42,740
BUT THIS PRESIDENT HAD A LIST.

94
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:45,276
HE HAS TREMENDOUS CANDIDATES ON

95
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:45,910
THIS LIST.

96
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:47,712
HE SAID I WILL CHOOSE FROM THIS

97
00:03:53,418 --> 00:03:55,553
PRESIDENT IS STICKING TO THE

98
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:56,287
LIST.

99
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,556
THIS IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.

100
00:03:58,557 --> 00:03:59,824
THE SUPREME COURT IS NOT

101
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:00,858
SUPPOSED TO BE MORE POWERFUL

102
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:05,363
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE INDEPENDENT.

103
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,667
IT'S GOTTEN WAY OUT OF WHACK.

104
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:14,905
THE ATTITUDES OF THE

105
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:16,340
PROGRESSIVES WHO USED TO ATTACK

106
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:17,875
THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN BY

107
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,143
A BUNCH OF WHITE MEN WHO OWNED

108
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:20,443
SLAVE.

109
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:22,413
NOW THEY PRETEND TO SUPPORT IT.

110
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:25,616
THE POSITION OF THE LEFT:

111
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:28,719
THEY WANT TO ENSHRINE THEIR

112
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,954
IDEALOGY INTO THE CONSTITUTION.

113
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:32,356
WHEN THEY SAY SUPPORT PRECEDENT,

114
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:42,566
WAS PRESIDENT.

115
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,335
SEGREGATION WAS PRECEDENT.

116
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:48,773
NO, WHAT THEY MEAN IS THE MOST

117
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:49,607
RADICAL DECISION OF THE SUPREME

118
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,308
COURT THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE IN.

119
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:53,811
NOT THE CONSTITUTION.

120
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:55,212
BUT THE LEFTIST DIRECTION THAT

121
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:58,416
THE COURTS HAVE TAKEN THE

122
00:04:58,417 --> 00:04:58,849
CONSTITUTION.

123
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,519
>> Sean: YOU WROTE "MEN IN

124
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,852
BLACK."

125
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:04,355
>> IN 2005, I THINK.

126
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:07,124
>> Sean: ONE OF THE REASONS WE

127
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,826
GAME FRIENDS AND I THINK WE WENT

128
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:11,362
INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT.

129
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:12,930
MARK, WE BECAME FRIENDS BECAUSE

130
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:13,898
OF ISSUES.

131
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,200
I WILL TELL A LITTLE BIT OF THE

132
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:16,500
STORY.

133
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,440
FOR ME ON RADIO.

134
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:24,842
TWIST YOUR ARM TO DO A WEEKEND

135
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:25,276

TWIST TO IT DO 6 TO 9.

137
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:29,713

143
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:46,897
>> I WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT.

144
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:48,899
I WANT YOUR VIEWERS TO KNOW

145
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,467
SOMETHING.

146
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:52,336
WE JUST DID THIS INTERVIEW.

147
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:53,904
I WANT THE VIEWERS TO KNOW MORE

148
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:57,208

150
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:04,248
YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL BRACKED.

151
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:15,359
HOLD ON YOU GIVE ME 20 BUCKS, I

I WANT THE PEOPLE TO KNOW THE

154
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,463
REAL SEAN HANNITY.

155
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:21,599
THAT WILL HAPPEN.

156
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,868
>> Sean: I DID SOMETHING A LOT

157
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:24,768
OF LIBERALS DO.

158
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:26,871
HE TRIED TO GET ME TO TALK IT ME

159
00:06:26,872 --> 00:06:28,272
AND I TALKED ABOUT ISSUES.

160
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:30,107
STOP IT, TALK ABOUT YOU.

161
00:06:30,108 --> 00:06:31,542
YOUR LOVE OF THIS CONSTITUTION

162
00:06:31,543 --> 00:06:33,711
HAS BEEN YOUR LIFE STUDY.

163
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:38,849
IMPORTANT.

164
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,584
IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT, WE

165
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:42,786
WILL LOSE THIS COUNTRY.

166
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:52,162
OF ALL OF OUR LAWS.

167
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:54,198
YOU ARE HAVE HEAVYWEIGHT ON ALL

168
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:54,698
OF THIS.

169
00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:00,604
>> LET ME SAY ONE THING.

170
00:07:00,605 --> 00:07:05,843
THE PROGRESSIVES DON'T OWN THE

171
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:06,544
CEMENT.

172
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:09,280
THEY -- SUPREME COURT.

173
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:17,922
STOP!

174
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:28,365

175
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:35,205
I THINK HE WOULD BE OUTSTANDING.

176
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:36,707
