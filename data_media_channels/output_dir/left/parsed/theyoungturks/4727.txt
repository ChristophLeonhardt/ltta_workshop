EDUCATION SECRETARY BETSY
DEVOS IS UP TO HER OLD TRICKS.
LET'S BE FAIR, LET'S FIND OUT,
WE WILL GO TO AN ARTICLE IN THE
HILL, SHE HAS APPOINTED SOMEONE
NEW INTO THE DEPARTMENT, LET'S
FIND OUT WHO IT IS --
>>HOLD, HOLD, HOLD -- LET'S FILL
IN THE REST OF THE SENTENCE.
THIS IS TO HELP STUDENTS WITH
THEIR LOANS, BECAUSE THEY ARE ON
THE SIDE OF THE EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT.
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO
BE LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.
YOU AND
YOUR KIDS AND YOUR LOANS.
SO
NOW, WHAT MIGHT BE A REASONABLE
AND TO THAT SENTENCE?
FOUND
SOMEONE WHO IS AN EXPERT IN
HELPING STUDENTS WITH THEIR
LOANS, AND WHO HAS FOUGHT FOR
STUDENTS FOR LOWER LOANS, FOR
EXAMPLE.
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE
SENSE?
IF YOU ARE ON THE SIDE OF
THE STUDENTS THAT WOULD MAKE
SENSE.
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE
REST OF THE SENTENCE IS --
>>OH WELL.
SO, FOX, MEET
HENHOUSE.
THE GUY WHOSE JOB IT
WAS TO MAXIMIZE PROFIT ON
STUDENTS AND THEIR LOANS IS NOW
BEING PUT IN CHARGE OF STUDENT
LOANS FROM THE GOVERNMENT SIDE.
GEE, I WONDER WHAT HE'S GOING TO
DO.
I CAN'T QUITE TELL.
THIS IS
WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHEN
WE SAY TRUMP DIDN'T DRAIN THE
SWAMP, HE REBUILT THE SWAMP.
HE
IS THE SWAMP MONSTER.
HE CLAIMED
HE WAS AGAINST CORRUPTION, THEN
HE BRINGS IN HIS CRONIES AND
SAYS GO AHEAD, ROB THE PLACE
BLIND.
WHEN ASKED WHAT
EXPERIENCE HE HAS IN HELPING
STUDENTS AS OPPOSED TO HELPING
HIMSELF GET RICH OFF OF
STUDENTS, THEY BRAGGED THAT HE
HAD --
>>THAT MAKES SENSE, SINCE HE
WAS THE CEO OF A PRIVATE STUDENT
LOAN COMPANY.
THEY FURTHER
EXPLAIN IN THE HILL --
>>IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT BY
DEFINITION HE'S A BAD GUY, MAYBE
THE REFINANCE LOANS, IN LOVELY
WAYS, YOU WOULD HAVE TO
INVESTIGATE.
I WOULD BE
SURPRISED, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW.
SO I'M NOT JUDGING HIS COMPANY,
I'M JUST SAYING IF YOU PICKED AN
ADVOCATE FOR STUDENTS THAT WOULD
MAKE MORE SENSE WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT RUNNING THE FEDERAL
STUDENT AID.
MAY BE SOMEONE WHO
WORKED AT THE AID DEPARTMENT IN
THE UNIVERSITY.
BUT THEY DON'T
BELIEVE IN THAT, THEY BELIEVE IN
MAXIMIZING PROFITS OFF OF US, SO
THEY FIND A CEO AND PUT HIM IN
CHARGE WHO HAS MAXIMIZED PROFITS
OFF OF US.
THE HILL POINTS OUT
SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS FUNNY,
AND TELLING --
>>-- THE CREDENTIAL ABOUT HOW
HE WAS CEO OF THAT COMPANY --
>>THE ONLY VAGUE REFERENCE WAS
THE ONE I QUOTED YOU, WHERE IN
THE MIDDLE OF A LONG SENTENCE
THEY SAID HE HAS CEO-LEVEL
SKILL.
WITHOUT EXPANDING WHO HE
IS.
THE REASON HE HAS THAT SKILL
IS BECAUSE HE WAS THE CEO OF THE
GUYS ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT'S A
REVOLVING DOOR, SO WILL YOUR
STUDENT LOANS GET ANY BETTER?
GIVEN WHO WAS APPOINTED TO THAT
POSITION, IT SEEMS UNLIKELY.
AGAIN, ONE LAST TIME, IT'S NOT
TO SAY HE'S A BAD GUY, BUT THE
MORE YOU HAVE TO PAY BACK FOR
YOUR LOANS, THE RICHER HIS
COMPANY GOT.
SO NOW WHEN THEY
PUT HIM IN CHARGE, DO YOU THINK
HE WILL WANT TO LOWER YOUR
LOANS, OR INCREASE YOUR LOANS?
JUST DO THE MATH 
ON IT, SEE
WHERE YOU COME OUT.
