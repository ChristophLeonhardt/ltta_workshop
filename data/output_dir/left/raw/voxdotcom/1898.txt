1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:03,679
I have to admit that when it comes to food,
I’m a total sucker.

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,979
Whether it’s sugar or grease or carbs, pretty
much bring it on!

3
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:14,730
And I spend a lot of time in Montana, so for
me, that medium rare, grass fed ribeye steak?

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,059
Pretty much as good as it gets.

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,059
I know.

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:21,090
I don’t do it often and when I do, I gotta
admit I feel a little conflicted.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,230
And that’s for a lot of reasons, including
the planet.

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,519
But how big of a problem is what I eat?

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,740
I mean, does it really make much of a dent
in something as huge as global warming?

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,579
It turns out, what we put on our plates matters
a lot.

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,730
About 25 percent of all the global climate
change problems we’re seeing can be attributed

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,899
back to the food and the choices that we’re
actually making about what we eat on a daily

13
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:50,899
basis.

14
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:52,969
This is greater than all of the cars on the
planet.

15
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:57,199
In fact, it’s about twice as much global
warming pollution as the cars.

16
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,790
Ben Houlton and Maya Almaraz study the connection
between climate and diet at the University

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,069
of California, Davis.

18
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:09,360
They track how the way we produce food creates
greenhouse gases that contribute to global

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
warming.

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,340
With their data, the team has crunched the
numbers to figure out how much carbon pollution

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,210
is produced by different foods and different
diets.

22
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,500
A lot of people feel really helpless when
it comes to climate change, like they can’t

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,520
make a difference.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,220
And what our research is showing is that your
personal decisions really can have a big impact.

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,160
So, take that grass fed ribeye steak I love.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,631
If you really look at everything that went
into making a single serving of beef, you

27
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:36,090
end up emitting about 330 grams of carbon.

28
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,130
That’s like driving a car three miles.

29
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,140
Now, if I choose to have chicken instead,
there’s more than a five-fold drop in emissions.

30
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,790
Switch to fish and you see the number go down
even more.

31
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,430
Now, look at veggies.

32
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,030
If I swapped beef out entirely for lentils,
well, I’m down to practically nothing!

33
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,780
So, why does beef and lamb, too, for that
matter - pack such a powerful punch to the

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,280
planet?

35
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,880
Livestock accounts for a little over 14 percent
of global greenhouse gas emissions.

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,240
If that sort of seems low to you, consider
it’s about equal to transportation.

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,470
We’re talking all the cars, trucks, planes,
trains and ships on the planet combined!

38
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,010
This is partly because ruminant animals like
cows and sheep - they’re just gassy!

39
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,530
And the methane they produce is at least 25
times more potent than carbon dioxide.

40
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,170
Plus it takes lot of land, fertilizer and
about a billion tons of grain to feed all

41
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,170
that livestock.

42
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:37,500
And you could feed 3.5 billion people with
that grain; if we were just directly eating

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,030
these grains ourselves, it would eliminate
a lot of the CO2 that is emitted from cattle

44
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,030
production.

45
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,710
So it’s clear that meat has a pretty big
carbon load, but it’s also worth remembering

46
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,790
that not all livestock is raised equally.

47
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,990
In parts of the American West, for instance,
ranchers are working to raise livestock in

48
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,060
ways that actually help restore the land.

49
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,880
And they’re experimenting with ways that
soil and grasslands can be used to keep carbon

50
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,590
pollution out of the air.

51
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,870
But even these sustainable ranchers will really
tell you, we’re probably eating too much

52
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,870
meat.

53
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,300
I know a lot of people who if you don’t
serve them meat for lunch or dinner, they’re

54
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,400
kind of like "well, when is the meat coming out?"

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,700
It's to the point now where the U.S. actually
has one of the highest meat footprints per

56
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,700
capita.

57
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,910
So, what about not eating meat at all?

58
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,880
Vegan is the way to go for the least impact
on the planet, but it’s not that much different,

59
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,640
in terms of emissions, than say, a vegetarian
diet.

60
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,349
And the team found that the environmental
impact of the Mediterranean diet is pretty

61
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:35,890
similar to vegan and vegetarian diets.

62
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:41,420
It’s a lot less meat-heavy than what Americans
are used to - so, fish and poultry a few times

63
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,970
a week; beef maybe once a month, plenty of
plant-based foods, and of course, loads of

64
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,180
olive oil.

65
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,630
Eliminating like 90 percent of your meat intake
is more important than eliminating all of

66
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,630
your meat.

67
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,630
We don’t all have to be vegan.

68
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,300
We don’t all even have to be vegetarian.

69
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,910
If we can just reduce our meat intake, every
little bit helps.

70
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,910
And if you can bring it down a lot, you can
help the climate a lot.

71
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,800
If we all just switched to a Mediterranean
diet, it could actually solve 15 percent of

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,520
global warming pollution by 2050.

73
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,709
If everyone were to move towards it, that
is equivalent to taking somewhere around a

74
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,478
billion cars off of the streets, in terms
of vehicle emissions each year.

75
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:19,968
So, that kind of a footprint is big-time.

76
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:23,939
But say you still want more meat than the
Mediterranean diet recommends?

77
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:29,240
Just cutting down your portion size to the
doctor-recommended 4 ounces can reduce your

78
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,449
emissions by half.

79
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:31,449
That’s huge!

80
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:35,710
In fact, the doctors are telling us we’re
eating about twice as much meat as we really

81
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,370
need for a healthy diet.

82
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,889
The good news is, we are listening to our
doctors.

83
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,650
In the last decade, there’s been a 19 percent
drop in the amount of beef we eat.

84
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,449
All these things that you're already being
told are good for you also happen to be good

85
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:49,449
for the planet.

86
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:52,740
So what we eat really is a big part of the
climate puzzle.

87
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,830
I mean, we may not all be able to afford an
electric car or putting solar panels on our

88
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,240
house, but we all have to eat every day.

89
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,400
And these choices we make can add up to really
big numbers.

90
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,009
And since meat has a pretty big carbon load,
we need to be thoughtful about how much we

91
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,009
eat.

92
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:13,819
As for that ribeye steak that I really love,
I am honestly trying to cut back!

93
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:19,060
Maybe it’s just a smaller piece of steak;
or simply swapping out a meat dish for a veggie

94
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,060
burger.

95
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,340
It may seem like a small thing, but it really
does add up to big impacts.

96
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,199
Hey, so what did you have for dinner last
night?
