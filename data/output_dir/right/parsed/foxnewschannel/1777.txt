GAZA BORDER WITH MORE FROM
WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN SO FAR TODAY?
>> WHAT A CONTRAST FROM
JERUSALEM OUT THERE.
THE GRAND CELEBRATION OF THE
NEW U.S. EMBASSY AND NEAR 90
MINUTES SOUTH THERE ARE HEAVY
CLASHES AND WE'VE HEARD
EXTENSIVE GUNFIRE AND BOMBING
INSIDE GAZA.
IF YOU LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER
THERE ARE SOME OF THE TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE
GATHERED UP AND DOWN THIS
BORDER.
WE HAVE ALSO HEARD FROM THE IDF
NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TRYING TO
BREACH THE FENCE, COORDINATED
ATTEMPTS BY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.
THEY HAVE RESPONDED TO PROTECT
ISRAEL AND SAYING THEY HAVE
BOMBED TUNNELS THAT THEY'VE
FOUND AND THAT IF IT
INTENSIFIED THEY WOULD ALSO
BOMB INSIDE GAZA.
WE'VE JUST HAD CONFIRMATION
THEY HAVE INDEED STRUCK A HAMAS
CAMP.
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A
SIX-WEEK MARCH.
IN FACT, TOMORROW IS THE LAST
DAY OF THE MARCH.
BUT TODAY IN RECOGNITION OF
THAT JERUSALEM OPENING THEY
HAVE DECIDED TO GO IN A BIG WAY.
ALSO THE MOST DEADLY DAY WE'VE
SEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE
SIX WEEKS.
41 KILLED SO FAR.
WE EXPECT THAT NUMBER TO RISE
PERHAPS AND IT'S ALSO THE MOST
DEADLY DAY SINCE 2014.
THE HAMAS LEADER HAD SAID --
HAD CALLED ON PEOPLE THE TRY TO
CROSS THE FENCE SAYING THEY
WOULD BE UNARMED AND PEACEFUL
BUT SAID THEY WOULD BE LIKE A
STARVING TIGER.
SO VERY, VERY TENSE SITUATION
ON THE BORDER AT THE MOMENT.
