00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the oil coal and gas</font>

00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,400
companies the companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are driving</font>

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,740
climate pollution they are far too

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,900
powerful in these stops the people that

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,910
have real influence and determine the

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,070
final outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> as they didn't open again</font>

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,540
are the fossil fuel companies

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just arrived to an event called the</font>

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,090
people's climate summit it's an

10

alternative to cop21<font color="#CCCCCC"> organized by</font>

of alternatives where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can come</font>

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,350
and present ideas are not being

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,120
discussed in the halls of power but that

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,190
they believe are real solutions to

17
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,640
climate change

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,190
clearly NGO<font color="#CCCCCC"> Action Aid has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taken over a</font>

affected the most by climate change<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

21
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,780
also the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are already the poorest</font>

22
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,519
in the world and already suffering from

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,720
the most in justices

24
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,480
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of talks happening as</font>

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,360
well with speakers like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Naomi Klein and</font>

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,410
had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Greenpeace cumin idea that</font>

27
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,350
struggle starts yeah in Paris to send a

message<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our leaders that we do not</font>

trust you<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do not because you have</font>

00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,670
sold us out you've sold your souls to

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,010
the baby companies that are brought us

32
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,020
to this point we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> power and we need</font>

33
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to harness that power isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it strange</font>

34
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,630
that the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are sponsoring the</font>

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,970
hawk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually including oil coal gas</font>

36
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,730
the nuclear companies that is like

37
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,220
having a conference of Alcoholics

38
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,470
Anonymous and asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the alcohol</font>

39
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,150
companies to actually sponsor that

<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting community they had a greenpeace</font>

41
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,899

to speak to<font color="#E5E5E5"> him so we're going to get to</font>

43

tag along as he's on<font color="#E5E5E5"> his way to another</font>

44
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,860
talk

45
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,130
we need a head of Greenpeace the biggest

46
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">environmental NGO in the world what do</font>

47
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,750
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the UN climate talks the</font>

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,320
cop21 happening in Paris at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment</font>

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,630
certainly the cop21 is yet another cop

50
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,910
out in the sense of our political

51
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,790
leaders are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spin it as if we</font>

52
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">are making huge progress but in fact</font>

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,840
there are some really fundamental

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,150
problems he's still fighting we got a

55
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,370
week to go we still pushing for 1.5 to

56
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,950
stay alive but I'm not optimistic that

57
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,470
we'll win let's be blunt about it that

58
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,790
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are paying the phone</font>

59
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,100
first and most brutal price of climate

60
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,640
impacts now firstly are those that carry

61
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,370
very little responsibility for carbon

62
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,260
emissions and secondly they are from

63
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,600
small population<font color="#E5E5E5"> states from countries</font>

64
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,700
maybe that do not have diamonds and

65
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,960
other resources and quite frankly there

66
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,660
they have people of color how much

67
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,660
influence<font color="#E5E5E5"> does fossil fuel companies and</font>

68
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,850
big business have on the talks vs for

69
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,440
example environmental NGOs like

70
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,480
Greenpeace when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the oil coal</font>

71
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,400
and gas companies the companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,080
driving climate pollution they are far

73
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,090
too powerful in these<font color="#CCCCCC"> dogs I mean they</font>

74
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,209
did haven't they are able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> still get</font>

75
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,280
in excess of half a trillion dollars

76
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">every year in taxpayer money as free</font>

77
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,150
cash so when there is profit to made the

78
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">profits are privatized</font>

79
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,060
when these losses to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be made the losses</font>

80
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,220
are socialized level of influence vs

81
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,470
dean psf you know we must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

82
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,140
enough to make a distinction between

83
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,360
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to power and influence over power</font>

84
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,020
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have access meaning that we can</font>

85
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,750
enter the convention center<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get</font>

86
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,210
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-profile meeting very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful</font>

87
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,270
individuals and leaders and so on but

88
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,780
that's just access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

89
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,940
because you speak does not<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean you are</font>

90
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,130
hurt the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have real influence</font>

91
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,589
and determine the final outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> as they</font>

92
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,810
did in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Copenhagen are the fossil fuel</font>

93
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,959
companies

94
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,669
this morning saw the launch of this

95
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:40,190
wanted campaign by global advocacy group

96
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,090
of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> so can you describe who these guys</font>

97
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,370
are what are they doing today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

98
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,620
are they so dangerous we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

99
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,510
seven who you see the posters of behind

100
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,340
me are the ones who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> credited in the</font>

101
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,960
climate conference and they fly under

102
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,180
the radar so today's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about making those</font>

103
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,160
people famous some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them work for</font>

118
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:36,539
claim is that global warming is not

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,300
man-made the activists are here already

120
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:50,800

123
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,870
and we know we're winning the debate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

124
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,920
actual political and scientific debate

125
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,270
is because all that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> awareness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tab is</font>

126
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,490
trying to silence us this is the press

127
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,530

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,340
they call fossil fuel from the lobbyists

137
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,360
yeah the fact is that when you have

138
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing factually to debate with you you</font>

139

141
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,680
when ninety-seven percent of the world's

hopefully kinda why scientists disagree

154
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,610
about global warming and explains the
