it is finally happening president Trump is coming to California the president will be coming to the state tomorrow to inspect eight border wall prototypes four of which are constructed of concrete and the other four are constructed of steel and other materials now this is a really great opportunity for him you know legislative measures he can only have a certain degree of influence but not autonomously implement or execute but this is something that he can actively do to gain support for the border wall now it's not really a rally per se but this is definitely his element it's a construction site there will be hard hats around it's totally his element but of course massive protests have been planned which is just sheer stupidity because President Trump and his immigration proposal well it was much more generous than anyone ever dreamed of including the dreamers he was willing to give 1.8 million of you illegals a path to citizenship what else do you want are you really that desperate to get more of your very distant relatives in the country now look this is a state we already have a lot of issues we have issues of infrastructure quality of education fiscal issues with debt which by the way is understated revenue and tax structure issues water supply poverty and homelessness you would think that with the upward trajectory of employment nationally the California would want to I don't know maybe have a conversation with him about how they could possibly mimic that but Governor Moonbeam and AG Becerra are too busy filing 28 lawsuits and challenges against the president but we are so thrilled to have him here there are a lot of Trump supporters here probably more than you realize who would love to be flies on those wall prototypes because we don't get to have them here very often and see him in person now I am a bit concerned about the protests California has an unfortunate reputation for protests turning violent Berkeley San Jose Oakland here in Los Angeles so there's not a whole lot of sanity and reason flowing throughout this state so I'm just praying for safety and I don't know minimal damage from the anti-fascist slash protest crowd but regardless those wall prototypes are growing up the wall is going up it's going to be big and beautiful and it's going to be good for America it's like a reverse Field of Dreams if you build it they won't come thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from us at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at www.fortuigence.com and you have access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows just like that thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
