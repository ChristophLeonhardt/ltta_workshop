1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,401
>> Bill: SELF-PROCLAIMED

2
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:12,968
SOCIALIST ALEXANDRIA

3
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:19,141
LONG TIME DEMOCRAT IS IN

4
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:24,146
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

5
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:25,714
>> I'M DOING GREAT.

6
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:29,918
YOU DESERVE IT.

7
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:32,488
YOU WENT TO SCHOOL IN BERKELEY.

8
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:33,121
YOU'RE FROM CALIFORNIA.

9
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:34,389
SHE IS OUT THERE PITCHING FOR

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,192
VOTES AND TRYING TO RAISE MONEY.

11
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:37,659
>> EXACTLY.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,729
IT'S LESS ABOUT HER AND MORE

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,663
ABOUT THIS DISTURBING MESSAGE

14
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:43,432
THAT HOW MANY PEOPLE UNDER 30

15
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,868
AND 40 KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT THE

16
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:47,736
LEGACY OF SOCIALISM AND THE

17
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:49,171
SUFFERING IT'S CAUSED.

18
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:50,806
IT IS AN INTERESTING CONTRAST.

19
00:00:50,807 --> 00:00:52,908
WHEN YOU LOOK AT HER, SHE IS

20
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:54,309
CHARMING, YOUNG AND HAS A

21
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,643
FUTURE.

22
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:57,579
WHAT SHE IS SELLING IS THE

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,280
OPPOSITE.

24
00:00:58,281 --> 00:00:59,882
SOCIALISM IS GRIM, IT'S OLD,

25
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:09,124
MESSAGE HE OFFERS IS NOT

26
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:09,458
LIKABLE.

27
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:10,626
WHAT INFURIATES ME MORE ABOUT

28
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:13,762
CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK CITY.

29
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:16,231
THEY FLOURISH BECAUSE OF

30
00:01:16,232 --> 00:01:18,734
LIBERALS THAT GOT RICH AN

31
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:19,134
CAPITALISM.

32
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:24,806
IT GOT THEM TO THE POINT WHERE

33
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:26,909
THEY CAN PUT THESE HORRIBLE

34
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,609
IDEAS ON US.

35
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,613
THE INEQUALITY IN CALIFORNIA IS

36
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:32,114
INSANE.

37
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:34,716
PELOSI ESTATE VERSUS THE TENT

38
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:39,488
>> Bill: I SEE WHAT YOU DID

39
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:39,788
THERE.

40
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:40,889
BERNIE IS 70 SOMETHING?

41
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,227
>> HE DOESN'T LOOK A DAY OVER

42
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:47,829
-- THEY ARE -- THEY SEEM FRESH

43
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,565
AND INNOVATIVE BUT THEIR IDEAS

44
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:50,999
ARE DESTRUCTIVE AND OLD.

45
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:56,738
SALESMAN TO SELL BAD STUFF.

46
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:58,173
I DON'T -- I WOULDN'T MOCK HER

47
00:01:58,174 --> 00:01:58,640
TOO MUCH.

48
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:00,509
SHE IS GOING TO GET BETTER.

49
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,910
THE MORE YOU MOCK SOMEBODY, THE

50
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:04,279
BETTER THEY GET.

51
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,614
YOU LEARNED WITH TRUMP.

52
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:07,249
>> Bill: I DON'T THINK PEOPLE

53
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,451
REALIZE YOU WRITE ALL OF YOUR

54
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:10,485
OWN STUFF.

55
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:11,653
EVERY WORD.

56
00:02:11,654 --> 00:02:12,354
>> YES.

57
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:13,522
>> Bill: AND I'M TOLD WHEN YOU

58
00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:16,158
WORK OUT IN THE GYM YOU CARRY A

59
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,492
CLIPBOARD WITH YOU, BECAUSE IF

60
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:18,927
YOU GET AN IDEA YOU WRITE IT

61
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:19,861
DOWN.

62
00:02:19,862 --> 00:02:21,496
>> I STAND ON THE STAIR CLIMBER

63
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:24,333
AT THE GYM WITH THIS THING AND

64
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:26,201
I WRITE ALL THE IDEAS I HAVE

65
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:33,909
AND THEN I JUST KEEP WRITING

66
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,444
BECAUSE I HATE EXERCISING.

67
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:37,546
>> Bill: YOU ARE AFRAID OF

68
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:39,247
LOSING THE IDEA ONCE IT LEAVES

69
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:41,350
YOUR MIND AND IT IS GONE.

70
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,517
>> NOTHING WORSE THAN HAVING AN

71
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:44,152
IDEA, I HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT

72
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:45,354
AND IT'S GONE AND FLOATING

73
00:02:45,355 --> 00:02:46,254
SOMEWHERE AND YOU SIT THERE.

74
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:48,357
>> Bill: YOU ARE AGGRAVATED

75
00:02:48,358 --> 00:02:51,627
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BRING IT BACK.

76
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:55,864
>> IT DRIVER'S LICENSE  --

77
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:58,734
DRIVES ME NUTS.

78
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:01,570
>> PLEASE STOP YOU WALKING

79
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:05,307
PLANK OF REPURPOSED WOOD.

80
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:06,241
JOHN KERRY.

81
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:07,909
IT WAS THE WALKING PLANK OF

82
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,614
WOOD THAT GAVE IT AWAY.

83
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:15,951
>> Bill: RE PURPOSED WOULD.

84
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:18,553
PERINO, SHE IS SO SMALL SHE

85
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:24,760
COULD FLOAT ON A CHEESE IT.

86
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:26,628
>> I REVERSE THEM.

87
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,499
LIKE A GUM DROP IS DANA'S

88
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,134
MEDICINE BALL WHERE AS WITH --

89
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:39,341
>> THE BOOK IS OUT.

90
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:39,875
GUTFELD MONOLOGUES.

91
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:40,842
I ADDED NEW INFORMATION.

92
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:43,545
MORE NEW THAN OLD.

93
00:03:44,714 --> 00:03:45,881
RIDE ON THAT WAVE.

94
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:47,983
>> Bill: HE SAW YOU COMING A

95
00:03:47,984 --> 00:00:00,000
MILE AWAY.
