the Democrats have apparently discovered the Fountain of Youth rage speaking last week senator Bernie Sanders a crazed elderly loon recently spotted wandering around the country shouting about wealth and equality while closing on a second vacation home stated quote you should be angry take your anger out on the right people Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles speaking to Politico explained quote if we only turn that anger inward I fear we become the permanent party of opposition over the next couple months we better get our act together the Democrats are late to the game during the 2016 election cycle Republicans express their anger routinely and richly Trump himself cultivated that anger as he and Tuttle rightly wrote a National Review in 2015 quote many conservatives are having their Howard Beale moment they're mad as hell and they don't want to sit down and take it anymore now anger is nothing new in politics anger has dominated political discourse since the days of Moses ask him how he felt about a stiff-necked people seemingly ready to throw him overboard every few weeks and some anger is of course justified if you're angry at corruption in DC you have every right to be if you're angry at a heedless Leviathan grasping at your wages that anger is justified even if you channel that emotion in the wrong direction we can only to understand the anger but something new has happened to American politics in the last few years politicians have realized that the simplest path to power is to humor everyone's anger if you take someone to anger away from them you've emotionally castrated them more important you run the risk of driving them into the arms of someone who will feed their anger an anger that will now turn on you for the sin of having discounted that anger in the first place this is deeply unhealthy one of the great lives of psychology dominant since the era of Freud is that coddling emotions it leads to more emotional fulfillment actually coddling emotions leads to emotional and healthiness it even leads us to wah-wah-wah low in our emotions anger feels good and it feels even better when someone tells you you're not wrong to be angry in the first place if you crave emotional payoff and if those around you are taught to costate your emotions you're likely to engage more and more often in emotionally overwrought behavior bad psychologists indulge their clients emotional states good psychologists ask whether those emotional states are justified as social psychologist Jonathan Haidt among other states cognitive behavioral therapy a technique used to treat those with emotional disorders is generally as effective as antidepressants for anxiety and depression therapy consists of identifying illogical links in a chain of thought that lead to an emotionally hazardous place you might figure out for example that you're attributing motives to someone even though you have no evidence about his motives or that you over generalize or that you're looking only at the bad things in your life rather than at the good things once you've identified your own faulty thinking you can stop the emotional runaway train politicians however are trained to do the opposite politicians spend their lives seeking the favor of others that means they find it wildly beneficial to nurse the emotions and the grievances of constituents the customer is always right of course it means that if a constituent is angry the best option isn't help break the chain of emotional volatility it's to channel that volatility into beating back enemies if you wonder why generic congressional support is so low but support for local incumbents is so high this is why your local congressman here is you and understands you but the far away government full of cronies and fools simply doesn't on a national level such pandering has become endemic it's why Hillary Clinton presided over the intersectional Olympics in 2016 in which voters must constantly be reassured that their anger at alleged victim hood isn't illegitimate and why Trump spends inordinate amount of time talking about Rust Belt voters who must be reassured that their anger at the system in China and Mexico is worthwhile all of which makes very toxic politics the founders knew public passions were constantly at risk of demagoguery it's why they weren't Democrats they believed in a system that would check passion with passion and they believed in a system in which each politician would be forced to answer to so many different factions he would be fully incapable of satisfying all of them in Federalist 10 Madison eloquently laid out the problem of demagoguery his answer gridlock federalism various legislative entities passions incapable of satisfaction at the governmental level without such a system Madison wrote the dust baptism of the majority would rule quote if the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control Madison was not wrong to rely on the intricate framework of the American government as a bulwark against the perverse passions of the majority but he also relied on local interests to supersede national interest and diffusion of power to defeat virtually all interests the growth of the federal government has rendered all such notions obsolete on the one hand local interests can now dictate national interests President Trump can cater to the anger of a factory worker by promising tariffs that affect everyone on the other hand every local politician can now campaign nationally Eric Garcetti barely presides over the potholes in LA but he's seen as the national face for his party the result a national pathology and the only cure Americans must get real and that means unfortunately politicians have to be brave they must tell voters when their anger is both misplaced and unearned they must be willing to stand with truth rather than with the power of sympathy if they don't the anger that politicians have attempted to channel for their own ends will eventually burst loose in ways those politicians never anticipated I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show okay we're going to get to all of the latest with regard to this horrific shooting in Alexandria Virginia today for those who don't know there was a leftist apparent leftist psychopath who went and shot a bunch of members of Congress and their aides over at a baseball field in Alexandria Virginia they were practicing for a congressional softball charity game is the only nice thing in Washington DC and it has to be ruined by a radical leftists who decided to murder people and will talk about all of that the fallout from that what it means for free speech and who gets to be

what we now know we know that the shooter the alleged shooter is and I always say alleged for legal reasons his name is James T Hodgkinson he's identified by The Washington Post sixty-six years old and here's what the Washington Post reports they say the shooter at the GOP congressional baseball practice this morning is James T Hodgkinson of Belleville Illinois according to law enforcement officials Hodgkinson 66 owns a home inspection business his home inspection license expired in November 2016 and was not renewed according to state records he was charged in April 2006 with battery and aiding damage to a motor vehicle so he's got a history of some violence as well here's some of the media coverage of the Congressional baseball practice shootings clip 19 so there were two bits of gunfire and how long did a like pop pop pop it was returned and another bunch that it went off for a while I would say at least four to five minutes starting and stopping so it could have been someone was trying to catch the guy that was shooting at him or he was beginning to take out everybody my thinking was in the YMCA you said you ran right into the house you felt concerned kind of elaborate on what was going through your mind I'm sure your heart was racing you're in your yard mowing the lawn and there's shots up the street you don't want to get shot just to move you're just horrifying they say 50 to 60 shots were fired Congress Senator Rand Paul was there he said if the police had not been there there would have definitely been a score apparently Capitol Police were there because Steve Scalise who was shot he's the House Majority Whip he he had brought the some security with him and the Capitol Police ended up shooting the guy and apparently killing him this this piece of crap James Hodgkinson is indeed dead here's Rand Paul talking about what it would have been stances as they played out in Alexandria right now we are hearing more details from mo Brooks at Alabama Republican who was among those present today at that baseball practice he said this morning in an interview of the shooter he was going after elected officials it sure as heck wasn't an accident and Rand Paul the Kentucky Senator who was also there said who have been warming up at a batting cage during this practice he was just keeping praise on the Capitol Police who he says happened to be there because the majority with Steve Scalise was there he said had they not been there it would have been a massacre this morning Rand Paul and others are praising the police specifically for their bravery on this Mel Brooks as a congressman on the scene he also described the shooting and then there's another GOP representative who said that before the shooting this this guy Hodgkinson walked up to him and asked him if Democrats or Republicans were playing on the field so yes there was political motivation this would fall under the category of political terrorism here is representative describing this this murderer comin or attempted murder because I don't think anyone has died yet except for the shooter I asked asking whether it was Republicans or Democrats practicing on the field what I'd like to tosha's give you an overview of what took place we received a call of an active fear shots fired zero seven zero nine three nine minutes after seven sporting my hair at the port on Monroe the Simpson Park had that five there was a practice game event for the baseball team we're representing some folks on the hill we were there within three minutes we do know that officers on the office level police as well as three off ok joke a terrific response by Capitol Police they get there within three to five minutes Governor Terry McAuliffe was the governor of Virginia he of course came out immediately with the Democratic talking points whenever there's a situation like this the Democratic talking point is it must be the guns now according to Rand Paul if there's nobody there with a gun then this guy just mows everybody down and he can do it as leisure I mean he's literally walking through a crowded area there are kids there and they killing people Governor Terry McAuliffe however he says this is really just the result of too many guns clip 24 you think anything more need to do to protect politician well let me say this I think we need to do more to protect all of our citizens I have long advocated this is not what today is about but there are too many guns on the street we lose 93 million Americans a day to gun violence I mean I've long talked about this that progress is early even on Denver said we don't lose 93 million Americans a day and again it was a good guy with the gun who stopped the bad guy with a gun not gun control laws there are background checks this guy was from Illinois where there's heavy gun control and we don't know where he got the gun we don't know if he went through a background checking apparently as I say had a couple of run-ins with the law he was charged with battery and aiding damage to a motor vehicle so he clearly had some issues he probably shouldn't gotten a gun if there was a background check so we will see what is revealed but again the Democrats always jump there instead of jumping to a bad person decide to go off and here's what we know about Hodgkinson Hodgkinson hated Trump here's all something else that we know about Hodgkinson Hodgkinson love Bernie Sanders okay so we have all sorts of graphics from his Facebook page his Facebook page it's chief it's key image is a picture of Bernie Sanders in the Uncle Sam outfit he's got pages up that he is that he's been tweeting that he's been putting out on the Facebook page talking about how corporations write bills and Congress are as bribed until it becomes a law here's something that he just said quote I want to say this was two days ago I want to say mr. president for being an a-hole you are truly the biggest a-hole we have ever had in the Oval Office okay same day make America great again resigned then he put out on Facebook a graphic because all in all it's just another bleep the wall picture of Trump with his hand against the western wall says the same day Trump is guilty in should go to prison for treason on June 11 please read and pass on and there's a quote from alternet stop fighting over who created the world and fight against the people who are destroying it in March he put out on his Facebook page Trump is a traitor from his destroy democracy it's time to destroy Trump and company so this is leading to the same conversation that we always have in the country when a domestic politically motivated terrorist decides to go on a rampage and we've seen this already in Portland the guy who was responsible for murdering a couple of people with a knife was a Bernie Sanders supporter Democrats have always tried to claim that Republicans are responsible whenever there is a violent crime they tried to claim the jaren law fair whose legitimately an insane person was responsible for killing Gabby Giffords because of Sarah Palin for some odd reason they trying to claim the Oklahoma City bombing was because of talk radio going all the way back to the 1960s JFK and his administration after his death tried to claim that it was the toxic political rhetoric and the climate against against JFK that led to his assassination not a communist stooge who shot JFK because he was a communist again there is always this conversation that happened and I think that there are several points that need to be made here one I am NOT going to blame Bernie Sanders for the attempted murder of these Congress people I'm not he uses inflammatory rhetoric Turner McCall from self uses inflammatory rhetoric here is an example yesterday there's McAuliffe going out there about gun control clip one he was talking about how there are treasonous Americans presumably inside the Trump administration coordinating with Russia to steal the election he said there are Americans who committed treason I think as we get into this it seems to me that Russia was actively involved in destabilizing our democracy so where's that American people somebody I believe had to give him a road map somewhere in this somebody was directing the Russians on whose names to use what impact these certain people sending a memo would have on the American electorate I mean they just didn't sit over in some cubicle over there somewhere in Moscow and figure this out okay so there he is basically humoring the idea that somebody has committed treason the penalty for treason under the Constitution of the United States is death is that because Terry McAuliffe actually want some nutcase to go and shoot up a bunch of people No I don't think so this is heated political rhetoric it's pretty normal so I want to point out a couple let's start with this just because Bernie Sanders says inflammatory things does not make him responsible for what this guy did any more than the fact that Donald Trump says inflammatory things would make him responsible if somebody had gone and done this to Democrats okay that's not how political rhetoric works in the country I judge whether political rhetoric is directly responsible for violence if the political rhetoric directly tells people to commit acts of violence that's when political rhetoric is responsible for violence otherwise we're going to get into very dicey territory where we decide to shut down free speech because it could promote violence that's the direction everybody likes to move Barack Obama did a whole campaign style rally after the Gabby Giffords shooting in which he blamed toxic political rhetoric from the right and he blames lack of gun control and then he suggested that basically the right and his toxicity was responsible in some way for all of this I'm not going to do that I thought it was immoral and Obama did and I think tomorrow when anybody does it the way that you can connect rhetoric and ideology with actual violence is if that rhetoric and ideology is actually calling for violence so for example radical Islamic jihadism actually calls for violence governing Sharia law is a call for actual violence against human beings and one of the ways that you can judge whether the rhetoric is actually calling for violence is whether this is a rare exception to a general rule or whether it is a widespread belief a wide held belief and a lot of people are participating in it so terrorism is a widespread thing it's happening all over the world they're regimes that are participating in it they're regimes that are funding it and there are large swaths of the population in the radical Muslim world and a new just fundamentalist Muslim world that are supportive of the general beliefs of some of the terrorists including the use of violence okay that is not the case here I'm not seeing the upsurge from the left saying I'm so glad that this guy went out and shot a bunch of a bunch of Republican Congress people so I'm not going to equate American left this with jihadis and just because the left does this to the right doesn't mean it's okay for us to do it just because the Southern Poverty Law Center tries to connect every act by a loon who once listen to Rush Limbaugh with Rush Limbaugh's views does not mean that I'm going to participate in the same thing because I think it's disgusting when they do it so it'd be equally disgusting when we do it and I want to talk about though I do want to talk about when rhetoric is responsible for creating a toxic climate and what that chili means generally so I've talked about when rhetoric is directly responsible for violence well I'll try and I'll talk about in a second when it's sort of indirectly responsible for creating a climate that creates more of these sort of isolated events but before I do that I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at tracker so if you lose your wallet if you

that they know that we sent you okay so I've talked a little bit about the the idea that left rhetoric you know tournament calls rhetoric Bernie tenors Rick I'm not going to blame that rhetoric for this guy going out and doing stuff and by the way I'm not going to blame even Kathy Griffin's rhetoric I'm not going to say the Kathy Griffin is responsible for this guy going out and shooting Congress people because I don't think Kathy Griffin told this guy to go out and shoot Congress people or said I think it's okay if you go out and shoot Congress people I think she's an idiot I think she's a fool if the Secret Service actually thought that she was advocating assassination they would have arrested her and it is not a crime to say go to things a lot of people today on the right are going to do the Shakespeare in the Park routine where Julius Caesar is played by Trump and assassinated that this is what led to the events of today I'm not going to do that because I think it's gross when the left does that yeah I think that there can be a badly interpreted play I think there can be a play that I would think crosses some lines without saying that it is directly responsible for the violence now it is true that as rhetoric and violent rhetoric escalates on both sides political I'll and it's been ignored on the left by the media the right is pointing it out with regard to Trump and it is certainly true the Kathy Griffin stop the Shakespeare in the Park stop a toxic political climate is not going to make rational people go out and shoot Congress people but it is going to have an outsized impact on what we in the legal field call somebody with an eggshell skull right the idea that somebody is right on the bird and now the climate has become so toxic the day that he's going to go nuts and start shooting people the toxic political climate is indirectly responsible for this so what does that suggest it suggests everybody should rapture this stuff down a little bit we keep hearing the war rhetoric from the left we keep hearing the treason the resist rhetoric from the left they keep bringing the war rhetoric from the right and the response has been from from people on both sides of the aisle to keep upping the ante well if they use a tactic why can't we use a tactic if they use violent rhetoric why can't we use violent rhetoric if they believe if the SPLC the Southern Poverty Law Center blames the right every time something bad happens why can't we do that too why can't we just keep making the rhetoric why can't we just keep making everything more and more and more toxic okay listen I am NOT shy when it comes to using rhetoric we've ever seen the show before you've ever seen any of my videos I'm not shy about speaking what I believe to be the truth and I'm not even try about using harsh language but when it comes to advocacy of political violence or giving the go-ahead to anything that remotely hints at political violence that's where we all need to take a step back not because it's going to lead to widespread battles in the streets although we have seen some of that with Antipa which actually is a violent terrorist group not only heavily but but it's going to have an impact if the entire culture goes toxic if the entire culture just becomes a war of all against all then that doesn't mean it's going to turn into open warfare in the street but it does mean that more nutty people who are right on the brink are going to be pushed over the line into doing something truly awful and truly violent so here's my recommendation everybody should take it down a notch try to decide whether your anger is justified before you vent your anger try to decide whether something is worth tweeting before you tweet it try to decide whether that Facebook post talking about how you wish Trump would just die already is worth doing if you're on the left and if you're on the right try not to respond by saying I hope you die right let's let's all just take it down a notch because I don't think that either you're the guy you're posting with is going to go and shoot somebody but I think that somebody who's reading might be outside it might be impacted in outside fashion now I don't make decisions and I don't think anybody needs to make decisions about their personal behavior based on the nutcase who could go nuts but I also think it's kind of immoral to talk in these ways as a general rule so I think that we should all take a step back in that in that sort of in that sort of notion and again I'm not saying we shouldn't use harsh language I mean for goodness sake I've signed books punch back twice as hard using the Obama rhetoric with regard to political battles but that is not the same thing as openly advocating for violence against people on the other side of the aisle obviously meaning things figuratively is not a good thing and I think that people including me should maybe take a step back on all of this and so instead of but in other words instead of blaming Bernie Sanders instead of blaming Donald Trump for people who are bad doing bad things I think we should recognize the supreme country people should say what they want to say but people should also take care that maybe it's not a great thing if we decide to inject the toxicity of violence into our rhetoric at every available turn and it's been just up dramatically in recent years okay so I no want to turn to more tacticity in our political culture but you're going to have to go over to daily wire.com right now because we're going to discuss the sessions here
