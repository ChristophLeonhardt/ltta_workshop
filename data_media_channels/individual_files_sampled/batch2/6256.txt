ACCORDING TO VANITY FAIR, STEVE BANNON, WHO YOU MIGHT KNOW AS THE HEAD OF BREITBART NEWS OR MORE IMPORTANTLY AS THE WHITE SUPREMACIST ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, IS APPARENTLY CONSIDERED RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING, YOU LOOK AT THAT PICTURE AND THERE'S NO WAY HE WILL LAST LONG ENOUGH TO DO THAT. BUT LIKE DICK CHENEY HE MIGHT ACTUALLY LIVE LONG ENOUGH. LET'S BREAK DOWN SOME OF THESE QUOTES BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ONLY THAT NEWS, THERE IS QUOTES ABOUT ANIL TRUMP THAT ARE FASCINATING YOU MIGHT THINK, WELL, HE KNOWS TRUMP, HE KNOWS TRUMP IS HAVING A HARD TIME, IT'S VERY TIRING, IT'S A LOT OF WORK OR IT'S ANY WORK SO MAYBE HE THINKS HE JUST WON'T WANT TO RUN AGAIN, BUT HE ALSO SAID IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION SO HIGH UP IN HIS MIND ISN'T THAT TRUMP WILL SIMPLY STEP DOWN BUT THAT HE WILL BE REMOVED EITHER BY HIS IMPEACHMENT OR HIS OWN CABINET COMING TOGETHER AND REMOVING HIM. LET'S PAUSE THERE. THAT'S SIGNIFICANT. SUPER SIGNIFICANT. WILL GET BACK TO HIM THINKING HE COULD BE PRESIDENT IN A MINUTE, BUT BANNON NOW TALKING ABOUT THE 25TH AMENDMENT IT'S SUPER INTERESTING TO ME THAT THE FIRST PERSON WHO MENTIONS ALZHEIMER'S IS ROGER STONE, NOW THERE'S A SMALL MOVEMENT FOR THE 25TH AMENDMENT, BLESS THEIR HEARTS, BUT BANNON NOW TALKING ABOUT THE 25TH AMENDMENT? WHERE IS HE GOING WITH THIS? ACTUALLY HE HAS MORE QUOTES THERE, IT MAKES YOU WONDER EITHER A) WHAT DOES BANNON KNOW ABOUT TRUMP THAT WE DON'T KNOW, OR B) WHAT ARE THEY SETTING UP HERE? IS IT AN ESCAPE HATCH? AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THAT I CAN'T THINK OF ONE SINGLE REASON TO BELIEVE A WORD BANNON HAS EVER SAID OR WILL EVER SAY. BUT HERE ARE THINGS THAT VANITY FAIR IS SAYING ABOUT BANNON THAT'S A DIFFERENT AGE THAN I WOULD PUT ON HIM AS A METAPHORICAL CHILD BUT IT'S STILL VERY CHILDLIKE. LOST A STEP. YOU CAN SAY THAT ABOUT AN ATHLETE, MAY BE, AND HAVE IT BE PHYSICAL, BUT IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A SENIOR CITIZEN LOSING A STEP, I DON'T THINK YOU MEAN PHYSICALLY. I THINK YOU MEAN MENTALLY. OF COURSE HE MEANS MENTALLY, HE SAYS HE'S NOW THE MENTAL EQUIVALENT OF AN 11-YEAR-OLD. I THINK HE JUST MEANS THAT HE'S FILLED WITH GLEE FOR THE WORLD. IT SOUNDS LIKE A FUN, KOOKY STORY FROM STEVE BANNON, BUT HERE'S A GUY WHO STILL TALKS TO THE PRESIDENT FREQUENTLY, HE WAS HIS CHIEF STRATEGIST BOTH ON THE CAMPAIGN AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THERE'S A REASON HE'S PUTTING OUT STATEMENTS, AND IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S NOT MEDIA SAVVY, HE RUNS A MEDIA ORGANIZATION AND PRIDES HIMSELF ON BEING MEDIA SAVVY. AND HE'S TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT HOW THE PRESIDENT HAS LOST A STEP, IS LIKE AN 11-YEAR-OLD, THEY MIGHT USE THAT WHEN HE FIFTH AMENDMENT ON HIM. LARGELY PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT, HE BRINGS IN THE 25TH AMENDMENT. I'M TELLING YOU, THERE ARE ONLY TWO REASONS THAT'S POSSIBLE, ONE, TRUMP HAS LOST HIS MIND AND EVERYONE, EVEN STEVE BANNON, KNOWS IT. BUT I SEE HIM TODAY AND HE LOOKS JUST AS STUPID TODAY AS HE DID A YEAR OR TWO AGO. BANNON IS NOT STUPID, HE'S GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS, STUPIDITY IS NOT ONE OF THEM, HE'S DOING THIS FOR STRATEGY WHATEVER THE REASONS. THE SECOND REASON IS, HE KNOWS AND TRUMP KNOWS THEY ARE GOING TO GET HIM, IF YOU ARE IN HIS BANK ACCOUNT AT DEUTSCHE BANK YOU WILL GET HIM. IF MUELLER GETS HIM, THEY NEED AN ESCAPE HATCH. THE ESCAPE HATCH IS, DEMENTIA, ALZHEIMER'S, HE HAD TO STEP DOWN. YOU KNOW THAT'S MY THEORY. I THOUGHT EARLIER IN THE CAMPAIGN BEFORE HE WON HE MIGHT STEP DOWN IF HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO LOSE, BUT IF HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE TAKEN DOWN, TO ME IF THE OPTIONS ARE STEP DOWN AND TRY TO SAVE FACE HE DOESN'T EVEN REALLY HAVE THAT UNDER THIS BECAUSE STEPPING DOWN BECAUSE YOU'RE CRAZY ISN'T RELEASE SAVING FACE VESUS LASHING OUT AT THOSE COMING FOR YOU, TRUMP SEEMS LIKE THE LASH OUT GUY AS OPPOSED TO THE STEP DOWN GUY. AT THIS POINT WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EITHER ONE OF THOSE OUTCOMES IN THE SHORT TERM ARE A FAIRLY LOW PROBABLY, IMPEACHMENT OR THAT 25TH AMENDMENT. NOT ACCORDING TO BANNON. HE KNOWS A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT TRUMP THAT WE DON'T KNOW. HE WAS WITH HIM THROUGH ALL THOSE TIMES. AND HE SAYS HE ONLY HAS A 30% CHANCE OF SERVING OUT HIS TERM. HE ALSO APPARENTLY SAID THAT DESPITE THESE INSULTS AGAINST TRUMP HE THINKS THAT TRUMP IS, WHAT WAS THE ACTUAL QUOTE? HE'S THE GREATEST ORATOR SINCE WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN. WHICH GETS INTO PENCE TERRITORY. NO HE'S NOT. IT'S LIKE WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN, TAYLOR SWIFT, DONALD TRUMP. DOWN HERE. HE HAS OTHER THINGS TO SAY BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE THEIR REACTION TO THIS REPORTING AND A SECOND BUT UNDERSTAND THAT STEVE BANNON, TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF AND WHAT HE CAN DO, HE SAYS DRIVE THEM OFF A CLIFF. AND HE CAN. HE HAS SUPPORTED SOME CANDIDATES THAT HAVE GONE ON TO LOSE, HE CHOSE TO STICK WITH ROY MOORE AND THAT MADE BREITBART I THINK LOOK RIDICULOUS, BUT HE DID IT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE DOESN'T HAVE POWER THOUGH. IN RESPONSE TO THIS REPORTING COMING OUT OF VANITY FAIR, BANNON'S SPOKESPERSON SAID THE PRESIDENT WHO IS AN 11-YEAR-OLD CHILD. FINALLY, IF STEVE BANNON WERE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, IS THAT A LEGITIMATE THREAT? TRUMP WON, SO IS IT REMOTELY POSSIBLE? NO. I TWEETED PLEASE GOD, I BEG YOU, RUN FOR PRESIDENT. AT THE TIME PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT ABOUT TRUMP I WAS NOT, I WAS SAYING BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR BECAUSE A POPULIST IS VERY LIKELY TO WIN. BUT A POPULIST THAT WAS A TV STAR, REALITY STAR, FOR DECADES, AND THAT IS KNOWN BY ALL MOST EVERY AMERICAN, IS ONE THING. THIS GUY WHO IS OUTWARDLY RACIST AND A LOT OF THE THINGS HE SAYS, THAT IS NOT WELL-LIKED YES AMONG HIS ALT-RIGHT FOLLOWERS HE MIGHT BE POP A SMURF, BUT TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GOING TO FINISH THIS ANALOGY, HE'S GARGAMEL. I VAGUELY GET THAT REFERENCE. JUST A LITTLE. I THINK DICK CHENEY'S POPULARITY ONCE DIPPED TO 9%, SO THE EVIL GUY BEHIND THE GUY, THE SITH LORD, THE SNOKE, ISN'T GOING TO WIN ELECTIONS, HE MIGHT GET THE POWER IN OTHER ROUTES AS STEVE BANNON DID, THAT'S WHY I'M NOT DERIDING HIS INTELLIGENCE, BUT IF YOU THINK SNOKE CAN WIN AN ELECTION I'M ONTO STAR WARS NOW IF PEOPLE WHO SAY YES, I HATE THE OTHER SIDE WAS THAT GARGAMEL?
