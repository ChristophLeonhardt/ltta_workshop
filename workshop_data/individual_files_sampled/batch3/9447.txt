DECADES. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT COULD BE BROUGHT INTO THIS. IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MUCH THEY WILL BRING INTO THE SUMMIT. ALL OF IT, PRETTY COMPLEX. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR MORE ON THIS WE GO TO DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN JOHN GARAMENDI OF CALIFORNIA. A MEMBER OF THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US. GOOD EVENING. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CALLING THIS A ONE-SHOT DEAL. THANK KIM JONG-UN WILL NOT GET A SECOND CHANCE. HE SAYS HE WILL SIZE UP THE KOREAN DICTATOR IN THE FIRST MINUTE. WHAT DO YOU THINK, IS THIS HISTORY IN THE MAKING OR WILL IT BE AN EPIC FLOP? LET US ALL PRAY IT WILL BE HISTORY IN THE MAKING. WE HOPE THAT THESE NEGOTIATIONS MOVE FORWARD IN A POSITIVE WAY. THERE IS EXTRAORDINARY RISK. MUCH OF WHAT YOUR REPORTER TALKED ABOUT ARE THE DETAILS BEYOND THIS ONE MEETING. CERTAINLY IT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF BEING A VERY GOOD PHOTO OPPORTUNITY. AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL SET THE STAGE FOR A PATH THAT WOULD LEAD TO FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS ON ALL OF THOSE VERY COMPLEX ISSUES. NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS WHAT IS THE ROLE OF SOUTH KOREA IN ALL OF THIS AND JAPAN AND CHINA AND RUSSIA. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH KOREA. ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE A CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY IN GOING FORWARD. I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE ONE THING VERY WELL AND THAT IS HE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED THE BAR. AND THAT'S GOOD. BECAUSE I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO SEE DENUCLEARIZATION COME OUT OF THIS FIRST DISCUSSION. YES, OF COURSE IT WILL HAPPEN OVER TIME. THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO KNOW THE NORTH KOREANS ARE SERIOUS. THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE EVER SAT DOWN ON SUCH A TOPIC AND WE NEED TO KNOW THEY ARE WILLING TO BE TRANSPARENT. THERE ARE SENATE DEMOCRATS TAKING A HARD LINE OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO PASS A TREATY WITH NORTH KOREA.WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? THAT IT HAS TO BE AT LEAST AS TOUGH AS THE IRAN DEAL WHICH THE PRESIDENT DID BACK OUT OF. THAT IS COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION. THAT IS ALL OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO BUILD A NUCLEAR BOMB ARE NOT AVAILABLE. WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO AWAY WITH THE INTELLECTUAL ABILITY BUT ALL THE PHYSICAL. THE ONE FELLOW THAT HAS BEEN TO ALL OF THE NORTH KOREAN OR MOST OF, IF NOT ALL OF THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR OPERATIONS AS IT WILL TAKE A DECADE TO COMPLETELY THE NUCLEAR EYES. HE DID SAY HOWEVER, SOMETHING CAN BE DONE IMMEDIATELY. FOR EXAMPLE, GET RID OF THE MOMS AND THE PHYSICAL MATERIAL THAT WOULD MAKE ADDITIONAL BOMBS. CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR STEP FORWARD. I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THERE IS STILL A WAR UNDERWAY. THERE IS AN ARMISTICE OR A CEASE-FIRE. SOUTH KOREA HAS ASKED FOR A PEACE TREATY. THAT WILL HAVE TO BE AT LEAST ONE OF THE FIRST ISSUES THAT COME UP IN THE SECOND, THIRD OR FOURTH ROUNDS OF DISCUSSIONS WHICH WILL NOT INVOLVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES. MY CONCERN IS WE'VE HAD TOUGH WORDS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO PRINCIPLES. WILL THEY BE ABLE TO GET PAST THAT? I HOPE SO. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE KIM JONG-UN. HE IS ALSO A VERY VICIOUS AND DANGEROUS PERSON DANGEROUS PERSON. LET'S NOT FORGET THE ATROCITIES TO HIS OWN PEOPLE. TWO AUTO OTTO WAMBIER, ALL OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN CAPTURED AND TORTURED. AND THE HYDROGEN BOMB THAT HE SUCCESSFULLY TESTED IN SEPTEMBER. THE WHOLE POINT IS HISTORY MAY NOT REPEAT ITSELF. WE KNOW NORTH KOREA CAN'T BE TRUSTED. GOING INTO THIS YOU KEEP BOTH EYES WIDE OPEN. LISTEN TO SCOTT TAYLOR THAT STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF - - IN THAT HISTORY DOES NOT REPEAT ITSELF. I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. IMPORTANT. EVEN PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD HIS DEAL CRAFTED IN A WAY WHERE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SENATE AND ALL OBAMA DID THE SAME THING WITH THE IRAN DEAL. I THINK THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE, BECAUSE WHAT WHAT PRESIDENT DOES AS A DEAL, THE OTHER ONE CAN UNDO IT. THE ONLY WAY YOU HAVE THAT LASTING IT'S A DO IT AS A TREATY. WHAT INTRIGUES ME IS HOW THESE TWO NATIONS REACHED THIS POINT WHEN TWO MONTHS AGO THEY WERE THREATENING EACH OTHER WITH NUCLEAR WAR. IS KIM SERIOUS AND HOW WILL THE PRESIDENT KNOW IF HE'S BLUFFING? HE SAYS HE'LL KNOW IN THE FIRST MINUTE AND I DOUBT THAT. I THINK KIM JONG-UN WILL HOLD A LOT OF HIS CARS VERY CLOSE. THINK HE WILL SMILE AND HE WANTS A PHOTO OP. PERHAPS MORE THAN THE PRESIDENT DOES. KEEP IN MIND THAT THE THREE GENERATIONS OF THE KIM FAMILY HAVE TRIED TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS DIRECTLY WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED UNTIL TOMORROW'S MOMENT. THIS IS A HUGE PUBLIC RELATIONS ISSUE BACK HOME IN NORTH KOREA. SO KIM JONG-UN IS LIKELY TO BE VERY CORDIAL. I THINK WE WILL GET A LOT OF SMILES. IS HE - - ON THE PRESIDENT, LET'S HOPE NOT. THIS WILL NOT BE SIMPLE AND I'M NOT SURE A TREATY WILL BE SUFFICIENT. IT IS CERTAINLY A MAJOR AND IMPORTANT STEP BUT DO KEEP IN MIND, THE UNITED STATES HAS BACKED AWAY FROM A TREATY AS HAS RUSSIA. THAT DOESN'T PROVIDE A THAT DOESN'T PROVIDE AGUARANTEE . IS VERY INTRUSIVE OBSERVATION OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN NORTH KOREA. CONGRESSMAN GARY GARAMENDI. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I SAID GET INTO TALKS AND FORGET THE PHOTO OP.THAT GETS NOTHING DONE NOTHING DONE.
