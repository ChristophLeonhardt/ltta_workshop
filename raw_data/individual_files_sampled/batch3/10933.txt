hi this is Max Keiser this is the cars report later on the program I will not be talking to later DiCaprio or Bruce Willis Stacy yes we are still in Hollywood this is downtown Los Angeles California it is now become not so much just Skid Row it's also hipster Ville you know everywhere there's a Skid Row in in the west coast of America you also have hipsters Seattle Silicon Valley in downtown LA you know one of the guys leading the whole Silicon Valley wave of hipster bills is Google's Eric Schmidt accidentally discovers labor unions so you remember last week Eric Schmidt CEO of Google he tweeted let's find ideas that can increase the wages of 100,000 low and moderate-income workers by at least $10,000 delighted to support call for ideas for a unicorn for the middle class JFS one billion dollar wage gained challenge yeah it's interesting because of course Google and Silicon Valley exist due to government subsidies government subsidizes all the preliminary the primary technology that goes into an Apple component or DARPA of course is the basis for Google and so these guys are riding on top of government subsidies government essentially has provided these guys with a guaranteed wealth and now Eric Schmidt thinking that he has invented this somehow magically from the unicorns out of and lollipops is talking about well how do we increase wages and again as I've said on this show many many times that yes unions are there to provide wage protection for workers and there's a choice people have to make either they are for unions and for centralized banks that provide subsidies to Eric Schmidt and Google or they have neither they have neither unions or they don't have subsidies from the government from Eric Schmidt and subsidies for the business through central bank gifting of money so you have to pick you can't just have workers exposed to the market without any subsidies whatsoever but Derek Schmidt Google Apple and Jeff Bezos and now it's got a huge subsidy from the government for a satellite contract lives in la-la land of unicorns and ask the question what can we do for the workers that were disenfranchising who are dying on Skid Row who are becoming alcohol drug addicts on our doorstep they're such a nuisance you know he doesn't understand the first thing about economics but he loves the free money he loves the handouts well he loves to feel good about himself a lot of people in Silicon Valley would like to feel good about themselves but when put to the vote like recently in Cupertino where Apple is based there was a vote to have some low-income housing and there were that the quotes from people who attended these are probably very well-meaning sort of people probably hate any sort of Trump voters and the deplorable is that voted for Trump or or people who don't like you know it's all the sort of situation of our economy at the moment that they themselves were standing up and saying we don't want any poor people here because then it will bring in the uneducated and we don't want those people here there are only people and they've existed on this planet for many hundreds of thousands of years without this wealth and income disparity that we've seen over the past few hundred years engineered by people like Eric Schmidt who's an engineer it was engineered wealth inequality as a means to an end now if there's going to be a rectification of this then there needs to be an address on the fundamental underlying reasons for all of this but are people willing to accept that reality no they're gonna create more computer algorithms to take them away from reality well but it's also an overall problem with our economy is like instead of just fixing the health care system we have a system whereby you have to go to a website and beg for money and and and have an a convincingly distressed story and have a compelling story that people might give you money here instead of just fixing the you know unionize and more workers or doing something different he's like well let's appeal to me Eric Schmidt and if I like your story I might give you a billion dollars also the fact that he misses unions and many people you know obviously thousands of people tweeted back at him yeah I think you just discovered unions I want to look at another sort of union that Eric Schmidt himself belongs to and this is a headline from 2011 Steve Jobs Mark Zuckerberg flanked Obama at Tech Titan dinner so this is a photo of from January 2011 sitting next to Obama or Mark Zuckerberg Steve Jobs just a few months before he passed away and Eric Schmidt over there he wasn't yet CEO of Google at that time but he was obviously part of this union of people who get to go to the boss of the government budget especially the defense budget in terms of the allocation for DARPA and all the investments in Silicon Valley so they get that's like a union there that collectively got to sit down in a room with the president and negotiates basically you know cushy jobs for themselves cushy contracts right in another word for that would be cartel this is a tech cartel no no less pernicious than the OPEC energy cartel look another way that you can rectify this situation is that everyone's got a Social Security number in America simply put 1% of all funds that are underwritten on Wall Street all stocks all bonds all currency swaps into Social Security and give all Americans a chance participate in the economy that they themselves are building and paying for through their taxes why should Americans work either taxes stolen have Obamacare stolen that half through the central bank that money transferred into the pockets of a few cartel members to create wealth and income gap social unrest social cohesion risk and wide-scale poverty why should that happen doesn't have to happen use your engineering skill to do something aside from lighting your own pocket and they're ugly self-interested selfish way Eric Schmidt or move to somewhere else we don't need you in this country well actually speaking of living somewhere else Google is working on contracts with the Chinese government and that has been in the news quite a lot lately this is a project called dragonfly so former Google scientists tell Senate to act over companies unethical and unaccountable China censorship plan a scientists who quit Google over its plans to build a censored search engine in China has told US senators that some company employees and he said senior employees may have actively subverted an internal privacy review of this system Jack Paulson resigned from Google in August after the intercept reported that a group of the Internet giant staffers were secretly working on a search engine for China that would remove content about subjects such as human rights democracy peaceful protests and religion I view our intent to capitulate to censorship and surveillance demands in exchange for access to the Chinese market as a forfeiture of our values and governmental negotiating position across the globe Paulson told his bosses right why are you putting into cultural silos intellectual silos you're being essentially this is a postpartum lab test-tube baby in other words you're born through means that would be natural the zygote is is created in the womb you're birthed into this reality a test-tube baby is done artificially with China and Google want to do our post partum test-tube babies they want to take the entire population and turn it into a glass walled blinder blinkered non-understanding non-seeing blob that they can feed ads down their gullet like ducks on a foie gras farm and then steal the liver and kidney for you now a few bucks right there treating us like chattel now this should be discouraged obviously because it's a rick repudiation of every single word in the freaking constitution this is a heinous treason exactly this was happening China I don't know if they have a constitution but we do here and the fact that most people are very happy to get outraged about stuff that happens in other countries so I see what the intercept is doing that most you know right on sort of right-thinking people in Silicon Valley in New York the likes that watch Rachel Maddow might be like down with China down with the censorship down with this surveillance yet one zooms this is also being enacted here and that well the very fact that you know certain people are blocked from Twitter and disappeared into a memory hole like perhaps people in China feel the same here like Rachel Maddow and anybody who sort of watches her will agree that we don't want to see any Alex Jones videos well maybe the people in trying to feel the same thing about the the people that Google are disappearing there maybe they feel the same right on as Rachel Maddow and that feel like what we need to disappear that person online because we don't want to hear their opinion of course it's happening here and you know the five eyes program the five countries that have gauged in massive surveillance and we know that the government is surveying Americans in real time through all of their apparatus through all electronic communications and this is a fact so they're not supposed to benchmark your policies toward a dystopian nightmare like what's happening in China so like the people in the Washington shouldn't just look over in China and say that's where we want to go we want to go toward a social credit score where if you blow your nose at the wrong time in front of the wrong person you can't get on a flight and go somewhere yeah but here is Eric Schmidt one of the leaders of the resistance we saw the videos from Google after Trump was elected like how horrifying this was but here they are working with China on enacting authoritarian dystopian future policies and they're happy to do that so it's like well either we have the principles that we don't so either you shut up about authoritarian ideas in one country and and if you if you are happy to facilitate them in another well Eric Schmidt is addicted to spying you know stone is an alcoholic or addicted to Doug drugs they're in denial right they they are they don't see themselves as having a problem Eric Schmidt has a very deep-rooted psychological problem he's addicted to spying on people and he's trying to be in denial by saying he's justifying it and saying somehow he's not he doesn't have this problem and he's a social pok pok mark on our society and he looks at it you just look at the guy and he can see that this guy is a blister and open sore on the American economy and he's blistering pus-filled nightmare that's it nobody is exactly it taking you know extracting from our public debate sadly and then finally I want to look at this one bit of the story that is remarkably so we're able to say oh my god this is horrifying that this happens in China but the exact same thing happens here Paulson said that the Dragonfly system that Google is developing for China contained code to ensure only Chinese government approved air quality data would be returned in response to Chinese users searched the country's authorities have a history of manipulating pollution data raising the possibility that Google would provide Chinese citizens with false information to downplay the amount of toxins in the air so look at what happened with fracking so in North Dakota for example you have to dispose of the fracking water and the fracking water has is highly toxic you produce four gallons of toxic water for every gallon or every barrel of oil produced you produce four barrels of toxic water well once there's so much nuclear waste in there that radioactive waste that they basically just deep hold memory holds that information they just that got rid of the laws against it so they just said okay we'll allow it so I'm just saying we have the similar laws we just disappear and memory whole facts that are you know contrary to profit we we you know to corporate profits so we're saying well ours is capitalists thought there are eight Arianism there's this communist but Eric Schmidt's a classic example of somebody who your face and tell you it's raining all right well much more coming your way right after this break don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to turn to Ellen brown author of web of debt and she's also a public bank activist it was part of a much larger group of activists with a success story right here in Los Angeles Ellen brown welcome back thanks max all right this is fantastic to catch up on what's happening here in Los Angeles voters will get the chance in November on the option of having a public bank Soto's about the measure okay well it's it's actually a measure to get a charter amendment the LA City Charter has a provision that says that the city may engage in all the functions of a Municipal Corporation this goes back to 1913 except if it wants to do fully something fully commercial a fully commercial enterprise they have to get permission from the voters right so if voters of the city create a purely commercial enterprise the cementing the city charter this changes stuff right what sort of activity do you see emerging out of this well we would argue that we could actually have a public bank that West Center commercial enterprise there would just be a public utility but if they want to actually give low-cost credit into the local community which they can do so be good for business good for students good for infrastructure all that sort of thing then apparently they need to get voter permission other cities don't have that restrictions so that that's what we're doing but the problem is the City Council put that measure on the ballot themselves in July and it was just a total surprise to us and so we've got like just two might well we got six weeks left and then the groups that's motivated this it's a very active young people's fruit they're Millennials that have mostly Millennials that were down there every day on City Hall trying to get them to divest from Wells Fargo and the city is City Council agreed but then the question was where do you put your money another wall street bank just sort of defeating the purpose so so they got the idea of the public informing a city owned bank and that and the City Council got behind that which is great we're excited that they're behind it but it's so short and Public Bank la this group has no money so just the hoops you have to jump through to do political things you have to have a campaign committee Millennials they got disgusted with Wells Fargo because Wells Fargo been doing some atrocious things all across the board Deborah Hale they spectacularly unbelievably bad so then they're thinking well you know we don't want to go into another Wall Street Bank so we'll do you know is there another option and then they discussed this public bank idea and then they found Ellen Brown in other words you've been around doing this for a while how did how did you get in this yeah well a year ago they had it what I mean one person that was involved with them knew about public banking and they had an event and they had me speak and they had some other public banking people speak and that generated interest then so ever these when you say Millennials you're saying these are 20 year old 2022 okay so that this is all new to them of course you've been writing about this for years and so do you feel you know having seen this evolve for a while that this is gonna finally be a push toward this very very necessary public bank facility opening up Ellen we definitely need the push from the ground from the grassroots and that's that's what they're bringing I mean we've had bills we've had over 30 bills that have been brought by one sort or another in cities and states across the country but what you need is a constituency that really wants it because it you can always the legislators can always find a reason to say no but what's impressive which is when you come up with some legislators that will say yes we should do this and what motivates them to do that is is a constituent that's really pushing it so yeah from my point of view it's like thank God the troops have arrived we've been working on this for a long time and now we actually have a groundswell from the bottom so people are starting to understand and the concept like cut out the wall street with middlemen and you save a lot of money I mean it's just obvious that if we do it ourselves just like a cooperative that if we do our own banking which is not that complicated these days it's all computerized then you can share the profits among the owners and the owners in Los Angeles of course would be the citizens of Los Angeles not only do you save money but you get back the power you get back control over who gets credit and who doesn't instead of the money going to hedge funds and not going to local business you can direct it where your city needs it or you can just refinance your own public debt and the savings can go to all those things like affordable housing I guess affordable housing is number one right now in LA for what voters are worried about yeah I mean that's an important point to make is that it's not about being anti Bank it's about being anti predatory banks the function of a bank it's as you say it's like a utility you know it it it keeps money on deposit at a certain interest rate it lends at a different interest rate and they make a sprint and that spread should be in keeping with good business practices and that's that's it that's what a bank does it's no more no less what's happened is that through in this country the Wall Street banks as you point out I've been able to co-op and annex all of the banking facilities all over the country and use those deposits to make incredible risky bets and when those bets go bad they get the government to bail them out right right so then we get messed over in many many instances so having a public bank would be great as a bank and it also would provide competition right because now those banks like Wells Fargo and others who are just engaged in the most heinous pilfering and larceny I mean they would have to double check back and say maybe we can't just our business model can't be too - just keep 90 cents of every dollar and fraud we commit we pay 10 cents in - fine right they got to change their behavior right right yeah am i seeing guys particularly well many cities have gotten exploited by the by these interest rate swaps which from the reason that we have to pay so much to Wall Street is because the Federal Reserve intentionally dropped interest rates to zero to protect the bank so the central bank is working for the banks it's not like you're you're insuring against an earthquake or some right let's talk about interest rate swaps for a second so these Sharpie bankers from Wall Street they arrive in a municipality many times like Matt Taibbi is covered it has excellent work for rolling stone and they'll say you know here's a product that will give you protection against rising interest rates and they're like oh great if interest rates go up you know we're gonna be protected with this great product what they don't mention is that you're not protected against interest rates going down and it's you're gonna pay more right now you gonna end up paying more yeah so interest rates low and behold they keep going down not because the market because the demand for credits still there it's because they're in cahoots with those proprietors who are putting out the interest rate swaps it's a complete racket right its racketeering right that's a card to and cartel and how do we break out of that I mean while sheets controlled the country for two centuries they're famous people have said that so and we try to regulate and it doesn't seem to do any good so our only real option is to just move out of that system and set up our own system at the same system I mean it's not a bad system banking is a good the way banks work it's a good thing it's just the fact that it's owned and controlled by right I could eat bread it's fine but if it's full of toxic sludge it's bad I mean it's just a product that's full of toxic curb junk now North Dakota is doing something as well a public bank initiative how does it differ what's going on there a Bank of North Dakota was established in 1919 so it's a hundred years old I started writing it about it in late 2008 because I knew they were the only state that had their own Bank so I was watching him and it was the only state that escaped the credit crisis the only state that didn't ever go into the red they had the lowest unemployment rate in the country the lowest foreclosure rate the lowest default rate the mo her banks per capita they didn't lose any banks during the crisis so I started writing about it and generated you know some interest but what what their model is by law all of the state's revenues are deposited in the bank and then they use that credit to put to leverage into the OPA the local community but they actually partner with the local banks it says right in their charter that they won't compete with the local banks they partner with them so the local bank is like the front office it goes out and gets the customers so one of many ways in which the bank and the major North Dakota is very profitable I didn't mention that there was an article in The Wall Street Journal in 2014 that said they were more profitable than JP JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs so so here we have an exemplary example of a bank doing what banks should be doing in North Dakota and during the crisis it did not suffer it did not require a bailout it remain it's up and running and is profitable so I guess your benchmarking that as an example for the projects here in Los Angeles right well we get pushback on that because people say it was a hundred years ago and weird this is not for North Dakota etc but it's an excellent model in it and you can look to Germany where that has the strong spark a sandbank to half their banks are publicly owned and or in the public sector and they hold that in 1945 that their economy was absolutely crushed and now they're the strongest economy in Europe so how did that happen that they claimed a lot of credit for that so do many models China is a good model okay let's talk about in a minute or so we have here so Janet Yellen remember her former Fed chair she's talking about the next big financial crisis she reached he just suggested that when it happens the Fed to start buying stocks in the open market I guess what we've seen is Switzerland in other places yeah your thoughts on this well it's shocking that they can buy stocks and prop up the market first of all it makes their policies look good when we know that their policies really didn't do much but because everybody points to the stock this is this is a measure of a good economy we are not allowed to buy or sorry our central bank is not allowed to buy stocks but the other central banks do many of them do and they're all in cahoots as we know from know me princess black among others so so the fact that they are propping up our stock market makes our central bank look good but the whole concept is shocking because one of the biggest shareholders an Apple computer is the Swiss central bank for example for example yes so and they could buy up anything they want in theory because they've got the power of the printing press and they have already declared their independence from government they're not working for us who are they working for them they are working for the banks and for this private international cartel of thinking intra big banking interests which goes back to Carroll Quigley wrote about it in the 60s that that the Bank for International Settlements was this cartel of central banks that and their goal was actually to takeover markets and control and actually buy up the world and make it look like the government's were issuing money when it was actually the banks that were issuing money right a lot of this stuff when you talk about it when writing about for years you know it's really coming to the head now really come to fruition we really see the obvious manifestations in these sky-high stock prices and the bond markets and in the financial chaos that's ensuing all over the world this is all vinick's written about in web of death all in web of death you read we have a dead you wouldn't be surprised at any of this what's it say have any events coming up hi I have three present when conference in two presentations so where's before we find anywhere these days LM brown.com is Maya Ellen Brown calm and probably banking Institute that ort public banking Institute dot o-r-g well thanks be on the cars report okay again thank you that's gonna do it for this edition of the cars report with me Max Keiser and Stacy Hubbard like to thank our guest Ellen brown author of web of debt if you want to catch us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
