1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,460
These are the 5 most valuable companies in
America.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,460
Notice anything?

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,460
They’re all tech companies.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,360
And their dominance is attracting attention
from watchdog groups that say their market

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,219
power is harming competition and the economy.

6
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:14,490
Is it time to breakup big tech?

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,750
To answer you have to understand how tech
has exploded.

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,060
For our purposes let’s imagine the top 5
tech giants as pacman, or pac-companies.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,690
Except in this game, there’s no ghosts around
to avoid- no blinky, no clyde, Blinky and

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,820
clyde being U.S. regulators.

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:34,290
For the past decade, the U.S. Has been hands-off
with big tech, letting them become even bigger

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,070
by swallowing their smaller rivals or entering
new markets.

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,090
Bloomberg data show that in the last 10 years
the big 5 have made close to 500 acquisitions

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,060
worth about $140 billion.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:50,990
Because consumers like their products, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google
have developed huge market shares.

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,329
For example, amazon receives 93% of all e-book
sales.

17
00:00:55,329 --> 00:01:00,170
Google pulls in 78% of internet search ad
spending in the U.S…

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,970
Similarly Apple and Facebook dominate in high-end
smartphones and social media traffic.

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,170
But being a monopoly isn’t illegal in the
U.S....Or most other countries.

20
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,070
Regulators stopped equating big with bad a
long time ago.

21
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,070
Monopoly cases brought by the U.S. have dwindled.

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,820
In fact, the last high-profile case was in
1998, when the justice department successfully

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,960
challenged Microsoft’s dominance of computer
operating systems.

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,010
And that 20 year dry spell in monopoly cases
has led some watch dogs to say that enforcement

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,020
in the U.S. has become too timid.

26
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,360
They say big tech is hurting innovation, jobs
and wages…

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,140
And some even blame the behemoths for a decline
in successful startups…

28
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,880
In Europe, America’s big tech companies
have faced more resistance with governments

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,560
more aggressively pursuing them.

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,689
For example, the E.U. has fined Google for
abusing its market dominance and Germany is

31
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,010
investigating Facebook for its privacy practices.

32
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,530
Of course big tech doesn’t think they need
to be broken up.

33
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,810
They argue their dominance isn’t necessarily
durable because new competitors can easily

34
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,900
jump in.

35
00:01:57,900 --> 00:00:00,000
As Google likes to point out, competition
is just “one click away.”
