when the beat drops it got super strong

that they can feel that's what music is
about as opposed to evoke emotion and

he's rapping about he's been through it
you know what I mean
he's gonna be a force to reckon where I
believe cuz anybody that could speak
truth and tell truth in a way that
people can kind of understand like yeah
he for real he ain't flexing like you
can win it like that
you got a fetish from

Gomez yeah that won't tell you 4:00 in
the morning anything goes it was hard it
was harder you know the contrast between
how lighter throat was and the heaviness
of the drums like it's like the beauty
in the beat Daniel was that's not Ryan
eyes this yeah that's Ron eyes
has he been smoking cigarettes a song he
might be fired a full blunts playing
recorded that's it clap your hands I
knew goddamn why she used to be lighting
