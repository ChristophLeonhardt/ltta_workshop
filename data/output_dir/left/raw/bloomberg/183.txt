1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,619
The world is running out of oil.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,200
At least that was the idea behind the “peak oil” hypothesis

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,840
that dominated economic thinking for decades.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,260
But it turns out that with fracking,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,991
deep-water drilling, and oil sands, there’s
a lot more oil in the world than we once thought.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
The old “peak oil” theory ain’t happening.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,240
But what if instead of running out of oil
we just stopped buying the stuff?

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,049
Most oilmen scoff at the idea. There are one
billion gas guzzling cars on the road worldwide today,

9
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:37,200
and only one tenth of one percent of
them have a plug. OPEC contends that even

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,790
in the year 2040, EVs will make up just one
percent.

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,550
But don’t be so sure. Consider the "S Curve.”

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,649
S Curves are used to describe the spread of
new technologies over time, like early refrigerators

13
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,129
and color TVs. Growth starts off slowly at
first, and then when the product really starts

14
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:59,640
to connect with everyday people: We have liftoff.
Eventually the market gets saturated and growth

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,610
tapers off, forming the top of the “S”.

16
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,819
Predicting the S Curve for electric cars is
extremely difficult, because we’re making

17
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:11,649
assumptions about demand for a type of vehicle
that doesn’t even exist yet: fast, affordable,

18
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:16,850
and spacious cars that have an electric range
of at least 2-to-300 miles.

19
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:22,179
But here’s what we know: In the next few
years Tesla, Nissan and Chevy plan to start

20
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:28,340
selling long-range electric cars in the $30,000
range. And other carmakers and tech companies

21
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:34,380
are investing billions on dozens of new models
due out in the next four years. By 2020, some

22
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,669
of these will be faster, safer, cheaper, and
more convenient than their gasoline counterparts.

23
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:43,389
That sure seems like the point when the S
curve goes vertical.

24
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,260
To start an oil crash, you don’t need to
replace all of the cars on the road today.

25
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:56,369
You just need to reduce demand enough to cause
a glut of unwanted oil. Consider the oil crash that

26
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:02,419
started in 2014. That was caused by too much supply,
when producers started pumping out an extra

27
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:04,819
2 million barrels a day.

28
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:08,929
So when electric vehicles are able to displace
that much on the demand side, it should also

29
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,879
cause a crash. When might that happen?

30
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,500
Tesla is building factories to go from about
50,000 sales last year to 500,000 in 2020.

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,540
Let’s assume for a minute that Tesla can
meet its own forecasts. And let’s assume

32
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,269
that other carmakers maintain their current
combined market share for plugins.

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,129
 If each electric vehicle displaces about 15
barrels a year, here’s the

34
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,319
impact on oil from all the EVs worldwide.
At this rate we hit our benchmark of 2 million

35
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:44,569
barrels of oil a day displaced as early as
2023. That’s an oil crisis. And the thing

36
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:50,290
is, it’s just the beginning. It’s not
at all unreasonable to assume that by 2040

37
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,870
nearly half of the world’s new cars will
have a plug.

38
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,959
Sure you're skeptical. The price of electric
cars still needs to come down, there aren’t

39
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,370
yet enough fast charging stations for convenient
long-distance road trips. Many new drivers

40
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,400
in developing countries like China and India
will still choose gasoline and diesel.

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,989
But imagine a future when the rumbling streets
of New York and New Delhi... suddenly fall

42
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:18,049
silent with electric engines. What if global
demand for oil starts to fall—at first by

43
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:25,140
a trickle, but then in a rush. Trillions invested
in oil will be lost, while trillions in new

44
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,209
energy will be won. The power of nations will
be shuffled. That’s the promise of the

45
00:03:31,209 --> 00:00:00,000
new peak oil, and it may be coming sooner
than you think.
