the legalization of marijuana in many US states is creating a massive new industry giving a generation of entrepreneurs and opportunity to strike it rich these are their stories Colorado hit 1 billion this year 1 billion dollars in sales 1 billion dollars in sales and over a hundred million dollars in tax revenue that wasn't done by a bunch of college kids the amount of people that come into our dispensary you know they look like my mom they look like our dad they look like me and Scott everybody smokes cannabis if you drink beer if you drink wine chances are you've probably also enjoyed cannabis so once we start to understand that and we let ourselves get out of that box and we talk about it openly there is nothing that can be done to stop this legalization from coming across the country almost immediately so Scott and I are involved in a number of business ventures we have our restaurant Jezebel's southern Bistro and whiskey bar which is one block away from our dispensary simply pure here in low hi I am also the principal of an organization called a cannabis Global Initiative which is a consulting and PR firm we look at working with municipalities and elected officials and some businesses to help them maneuver through the changes in cannabis law jaha has two different stories now same story same location but I met Scott in a bar and West Hollywood Hollywood Cafe figure if we figure with my hangeth that was it only together the first 90 days after that and we had 20 years later 20 years later my political career started from as long back as I can remember even becoming a member of the United States military you know came out of a passion for politics and wanting to be able to do what was right in the world when I was 32 years old I ran for Congress worked on numerous campaigns doing their communications for them which got me involved in raising a tremendous amount of money for Barack Obama which brought us on to the Colorado Finance Committee and then on to the National Finance Committee we don't have to preneur putting much my whole life you know the one jokes about what's my best meal ever have is it was the bowl of Cheerios that I had with all this sugar in the bottom after I smoked that first joint so I was hooked at 11 I've learned for my grandmother how to be a cook at a young age I also had the opportunity to travel to Jamaica and learn a lot of Caribbean cooking you know I was a Marine when I was younger as well you know one day I left Boston moved to Los Angeles I met my beautiful wife and partner and we had the opportunity to do our first restaurant which was Jamaican Cafe so that started my culinary experience you have to be in there for numerous years decided it was time to move on in you know we took the magical copied wine and we ended up here in Denver Colorado and we were fortunate here to open up another four restaurants here I'm always good and then all of a sudden boom it comes to campus business and you know at that point we had a lot of reasons to get into this industry cannabis has affected our family in profound ways my brother was arrested at the age of 17 with four and a half ounces of pot on him and for that he was given a 10-year prison sentence of that ten years he served four and a half years in Huntsville Texas picking cotton for free and this is one of the big issues that people don't understand about cannabis and why we arrest young people so often and it's because for nonviolent drug offenses and it's because they are working off contracts given to the privatized prison system so the best way that we thought that we could help make a difference and change those laws was for us to actually get involved and start to sell cannabis and we knew that we would be a big political statement when that happened because they can make criminals out of Scott and I because we had been involved in so many things where the press has covered us you know I've done a lot of cooking unfortunately for people who are very sick whether it's illnesses whether it's cancer whether it's MS whether it's multiple sclerosis migraine headaches the list goes on and on and I found out that cannabis works so with working with people and having cannabis and knowing food I was able to we were able to create another avenue for people to be healthier without prescription drugs and whatever so my adventure really was taking what we've achieved was simply pure in cannabis and really turning it into a whole cooking experience and getting people to understand the nutritional value of cannabis and how you can incorporate that into your life we were also with the first blacks in the country to get a license that was important to us well that's a really key factor and we're businesspeople you know this isn't an industry where you can just wake up you like to smoke pot you're in it you got to be business minded you know the regulations the laws it's endless so as we went down this path and learning more and more and more about cannabis it became just huge for us from an activism level because we're helping people with medical issues we're helping people understand a mass incarceration rate it's an amazing business to belong to I mean it's always nice to be on the forefront of doing something different in America and that's what became I think the reasons why we are you know head into this in a big way and then lastly you put on it that we've enjoyed this as we're connoisseurs we've always enjoyed cannabis from a recreational standpoint from the time that we were both teenagers
