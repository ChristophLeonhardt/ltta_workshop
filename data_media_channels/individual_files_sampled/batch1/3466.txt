hi I'm Brandon Webb former Navy SEAL author of total focus how to make better decisions under pressure and CEO and founder of the hurricane group my friends and family are always asking me how to be better prepared the biggest thing I think advice I can give women especially is to carry a high-power flashlight a thousand lumen flashlight a small one you buy for a hundred dollars on Amazon you have to spend the money but a high lumens flashlight that will blind an assailant in the daytime or at night is the best investment you can make because you could take it on the plane you could put it in your purse it's a flashlight even men I carry a high lumens flashlight and I remember walking in a dark alley having a bunch of drunk guys start hassling me and a girl I was with and I just shine that light just shine it on the wall next to them and it freaked them out they thought it's so bright it's like a police light and so that I've used that to defuse so many situations and I love the flashlight because I travel with it all over the world and it's you know you could take it through airport security the important thing is just to incorporate you know everyday carry carry items that are gonna be useful to you and I'm a natural disaster you know in an act of terrorism or you know worst-case scenarios
