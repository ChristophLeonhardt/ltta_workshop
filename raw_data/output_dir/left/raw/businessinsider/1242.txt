00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,009
technology space every company was based

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,020
on some idea that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I felt was going to</font>

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,540
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and in each one of</font>

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,969
these six times in my life over the last

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,730
25 years I was right in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general I would</font>

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,890
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who start companies are</font>

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,990
people who just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't live without</font>

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,330
starting companies if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,369
it's an option<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your life don't start</font>

11
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,590
a company it has to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only option</font>

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,330
in your life it has to be something that

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,000
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't leave without doing now</font>

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,059
in terms of how to turn an idea into a

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,360
business I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the most obvious</font>

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to say what I write a business</font>

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,340
plan i see i see investors i erase the

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,700
money but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say the most important</font>

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">aspect of turning an idea into a</font>

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,969
business you just can't stand the world

21
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:00,000
