1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,720
— We are in a parking lot that Houston
let us use as a staging area.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,800
Everyone is conducting their pre-trips,

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,920
where we check all our vehicles and make sure

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,360
that everything’s going to work safely for the day.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,080
And we receive our instructions of
where we’re going to go and pick up,

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,220
and then we head out and start our day.

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,160
We are here in the Kingwood area.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,980
It’s kind-of an eerie feeling because
you see these beautiful homes,

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,680
and they’ve all got open windows, you know,
and some of the doors have been removed.

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,560
Just like a ghost town.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,080
Basically, everything on the inside of the home

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,000
is on the front yard of the house now.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,120
This truck is a grabber that picks up debris.

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,140
We throw it in the back of these trailers,

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,540
and then drivers will take it to the landfill…

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,640
— I’ll take this load and come back to get another one.

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,180
— Yeah.

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,420
Sounds good, man.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,060
— …and they dump that and come back and
repeat the whole process five or six times a day.

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,040
I’ve never experienced anything of this magnitude.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,920
As I’m picking up these items,

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
you’re picking up people’s memories.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,860
You’re picking up family heirlooms,

24
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,500
and they’ll never get it back.

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,500
— I was able to save some pictures,

26
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,240
but as I opened up a cedar chest

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,920
I found some postcards that my husband
wrote to me when he was en route to Vietnam.

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,100
I mean, these things are dated 1968.

29
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,820
I was in the Army Nurse Corps,
so this came from Okinawa.

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,660
So I’m trying to salvage that.

31
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,420
I can buy another couch,

32
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,000
but where am I going to get another one of those?

33
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,440
Just a memory.

34
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,780
So seeing that, it’s just…

35
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,880
it’s heartbreaking.

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,420
It really is, I…

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,940
— We started about 10 hours ago,
we started about 30 yards that way,

38
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,020
and we ended up here.

39
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,500
And that was four or five trucks full,

40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,240
50 tons worth of rubbish.

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,220
Six houses, worth 50 tons.

42
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,840
So you do the math.

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,160
It’s a lot.

44
00:02:52,160 --> 00:00:00,000
But we’ll be back at it tomorrow bright and early.
