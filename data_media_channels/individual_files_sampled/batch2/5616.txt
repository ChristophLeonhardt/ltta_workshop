I want to bring in now the phone the mayor of San Juan Puerto Rico Carmen Yulin cruz mayor thank you for joining the show and I think our phone line is is connected okay right yeah I can hear you fine perfect so Mary let me start with a couple of questions for you I want to get your reaction to that new reporting indicating that the Trump administration has taken about 10 million dollars from the FEMA budget moved it over to ice you know it's an in Puerto Rico it's that you undressed the saint to dress another one and what he did is take money from a life-saving organization like FEMA or at least that's what it should be and put it in the hands of life caring and family tearing organization because that's what certainly ice has been doing in especially in the border at the United States it's tearing families apart and it goes to tell you work where president's priorities are they are not in ensuring that families are together they are not in ensuring that neglect does not add impetus people as it did in Puerto Rico with about 3,000 people said they are an instrument that whatever you think is right just gets pushed through with out any total disregard for people's lives and the impact that this will happen then this is what happened in mine and my idea actually most of apologies got changed usually municipalities like the mayor of Myrtle Beach which is speaking which is write a letter saying this is how much I have already expend on getting ready for the storm and they may give you a 50 percent reimbursement that changed in Puerto Rico it didn't happen for poor marina so that really curtailed the ability of many municipalities around Puerto Rico to perform life-saving activity well let me ask you two questions about that because the president is talking about that storm as you know over the last 24 hours the one that hit your area San Juan in Puerto Rico and the president tweeted this morning specific targeting you mayor as I'm sure you've seen he said we got a pluses for a recent hurricane work in Texas in Florida and did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico even though an inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent mayor of San Juan we are ready for the big one that is coming well went through mine when you saw the president tweet that well you know oh he did it again here he goes again you know he doesn't understand that this isn't about him and about his ego this is about the inability of his administration that he directs to ensure that the appropriate help got to Puerto Rico in time this is about his administration telling the Puerto Rico Power Authority that we should not buy generators or light poles from countries outside of the US even countries that the u.s. buy these services and materials from so you know the president is all about political posturing it's all about how good he's going to look and and I hope for everybody's sake and for the sake of lives being saved in North and South Carolina that FEMA has learned their lessons that the president has learned their lessons and that he goes to the state not to throw paper towels not to point fingers at who is in a humanitarian crisis doing everything they can but to do his job as commander-in-chief and ensure that he'll be kept there that is what we can hope 3,000 people died because they didn't have electricity in time and look our own government have some responsibility so that's what I'm going to ask you about I don't marry but but this brings me to the next question because you brought up FEMA you brought up some of the issues that that FEMA had in Puerto Rico responding to that storm Rock long the FEMA administrator was out this morning and because of the president's comments on Puerto Rico he was defending the administration and I want to play you what brock long had to say here's what he said sure we face a crumbling infrastructure it was rotted in decayed and FEMA can't help that we have to deal with the head of the deck of cards that we've been dealt mayor does he bring up a fair point do you bear do you bear some responsibility for the response to Maria well it is true there was a crumbling infrastructure but there has nothing to do with not providing the number of tarps that needed to be provided that has nothing to do with look seventy-five nineteen ninety-seven percent of the people that asked for funeral relief aid in Puerto Rico FEMA has denied them even though they have admitted and Brooklyn himself has admitted in congressional hearings that it took them longer that they had problems getting off the ground war if you're in the emergency management and it takes you time to get off the ground you're admitting to you're in the OL negligence now have we did we do a lot of damage before in terms of him telling somebody that is in a building that it's an old building that catches fire that example because they didn't run fast enough the truth of the matter is that reports independent reports from George Washington University from Harvard University have said that the majority of the people died from the botched effort and I have to say unfortunately that the majority of the Puerto Rican political class decided to be silent when we all knew that we were dying and that their bureaucracy and inefficiency of the federal government aided by the neglect the structure neglect that being a colony of the United States or a territory of the United States provides allowed President Trump to look the other way he has not tweeted one wants to say he's sorry about the desert Oh Riko but he has time to tweet at little old me mayor of San Juan Carmen Yulin Cruz joining us on the show this morning mayor thank you very much I appreciate you joining the
