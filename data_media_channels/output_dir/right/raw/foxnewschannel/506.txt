>> Judge Kavanaugh: THIS

20
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,840
CONFIRMATION PROCESS HAS BECOME

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,407
A NATIONAL DISGRACE.

22
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,476
THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE

23
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:47,514
SENATE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE

24
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,883
CONFIRMATION PROCESS, BUT YOU

25
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,685
HAVE REPLACED ADVICE AND CONSENT

26
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,320
WITH SEARCH AND DESTROY.

27
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,090
SINCE MY NOMINATION IN JULY,

28
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,258
THERE HAS BEEN A FRENZY ON THE

29
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:01,128
LEFT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING,

30
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,197
ANYTHING, TO BLOCK MY

31
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,232
CONFIRMATION.

32
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,234
SHORTLY AFTER I WAS NOMINATED,

33
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:07,935
THE DEMOCRATIC SENATE LEADER

34
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,137
SAID HE WOULD QUOTE OPPOSE ME

35
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,773
WITH EVERYTHING HE'S GOT.

36
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:15,843
A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR ON THIS

37
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:16,577
COMMITTEE PUBLICLY REFERRED TO

38
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:20,114
ME AS EVIL, GIVEN COMMENTS LIKE

39
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:20,414
THOSE.

40
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:24,685
IS IT ANY SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE

41
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,287
HAVE BEEN WILLING TO DO ANYTHING

42
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:28,489
TO MAKE ANY PHYSICAL THREAT

43
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,490
AGAINST MY FAMILY?

44
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,426
TO SEND ANY VIOLENT EMAIL TO MY

45
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:32,726
WIFE?

46
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,296
TO MAKE ANY KIND OF ALLEGATION

47
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,865
AGAINST ME AND AGAINST MY

48
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,667
FRIENDS, TO BLOW ME UP AND TAKE

49
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:43,471
ME DOWN?

50
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,874
YOU SEWED THE WIND.

51
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,509
FOR DECADES TO COME I FEAR THAT

52
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,946
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL REAP THE

53
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:52,313
WHIRLWIND.

54
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,081
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH ALSO HAD THIS

55
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,583
TO SAY ABOUT THE PROCESS, AND

56
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,685
HIS FAMILY AND WHAT THEY HAVE

57
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:00,020
BEEN FORCED TO ENDURE AGAIN WITH

58
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,088
ZERO CORROBORATION, NO

59
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,323
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND NO

60
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:02,757
DUE PROCESS.

61
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:07,261
WATCH THIS.

62
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,263
>> THE BEHAVIOR OF SEVERAL OF

63
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,965
THE DEMOCRATS IN THIS HEARING A

64
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,066
FEW WEEKS AGO WAS AN

65
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:12,767
EMBARRASSMENT BUT AT LEAST IT

66
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:15,770
WAS A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED ATTEMPT

67
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,974
AT BARKING.

68
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,109
THOSE EFFORTS DIDN'T WORK.

69
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:23,511
I DID AT LEAST OKAY ENOUGH AT

70
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,613
THOSE HEARINGS AND IT LOOKS LIKE

71
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:28,383
I MIGHT GET CONFIRMED, A NEW

72
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:28,883
TACTIC WAS NEEDED.

73
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:31,386
SOME OF YOU ARE LYING AND RATE

74
00:02:31,386 --> 00:02:33,521
COMIC WEIGHT AND HAD IT READY.

75
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,156
THIS FIRST ALLEGATION WAS HELD

76
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,491
IN SECRET FOR WEEKS BY A

77
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:37,859
DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THIS

78
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:39,928
COMMITTEE AND BY STAFF.

79
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:42,697
IT WOULD BE NEEDED ONLY IF YOU

80
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:44,265
COULDN'T TAKE ME OUT ON THE

81
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:44,899
MERITS.

82
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:47,769
WHEN IT WAS NEEDED, THIS

83
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:49,637
ALLEGATION WAS UNLEASHED AND

84
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,906
PUBLICLY DEPLOYED OVER

85
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:52,674
DR. FORD'S WISHES.

86
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:55,677
THIS WHOLE TWO WEEK EFFORT HAS

87
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:56,678
BEEN A CALCULATED AND

88
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:59,280
ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT.

89
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,916
FUELED WITH A PARENT PENT UP

90
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,453
ANGER ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

91
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:08,690
THE 2016 ELECTION, FEAR THAT HAS

92
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,691
BEEN UNFAIRLY STOKED ABOUT MY

93
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:13,494
JUDICIAL RECORD, REVENGE ON

94
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:14,162
BEHALF OF THE CLINTONS AND

95
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:20,302
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN IN MONEY

96
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:21,303
FROM OUTSIDE LEFT-WING

97
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:22,470
OPPOSITION GROUPS.

98
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,439
THIS IS A CIRCUS.

99
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:27,242
THE CONSEQUENCES WILL EXTEND

100
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:28,677
LONG PAST MY NOMINATION.

101
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:31,680
THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE WITH US

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,280
FOR DECADES.

103
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,416
>> Sean: AFTER THOSE POWERFUL

104
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,517
REMARKS, JUDGE KAVANAUGH

105
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:37,786
ADDRESSED HIS ACCUSER, PROFESSOR

106
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:38,253
CHRISTINE FORD.

107
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:41,723
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS EMOTIONAL

108
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:44,092
MOMENT FROM EARLIER TODAY.

109
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:47,963
I HAVE NEVER DONE THIS TO HER OR

110
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:48,463
ANYONE.

111
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:50,098
THAT'S NOT WHO I AM, IT'S NOT

112
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:53,502
WHO I WAS.

113
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:57,205
I AM INNOCENT OF THIS CHARGE.

114
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:58,607
I INTEND NO ILL WILL TO DR. FORD

115
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:02,077
AND HER FAMILY.

116
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:02,811
THE OTHER NIGHT ASHLEY AND MY

117
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:06,281
DAUGHTER LIZA SAID THEIR PRAYERS

118
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,884
AND, LITTLE LIES ALL OF TEN

119
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:14,723
YEARS OLD...

120
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:18,192
SAID TO ASHLEY, WE SHOULD PRAY

121
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,529
FOR THE WOMAN.

122
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,498
THAT'S A LOT OF WISDOM FROM A

123
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:25,033
10-YEAR-OLD.

124
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,102
>>  >> Sean: WE ARE THAT ON MY

125
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:28,804
RADIO SHOW WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE

126
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:29,171
AROUND ME.

127
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:33,308
GUYS AND GIRLS, THEY ALL WERE

128
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:34,109
CRYING.

129
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:35,511
POWERFUL MOMENT AND SHE'S

130
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:36,011
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

131
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:38,113
BUT LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO

132
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:39,515
REVIEW THE CHARGES FROM

133
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:40,315
PROFESSOR FORD, WHERE

134
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:41,617
ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE IN JULY TO

135
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:44,153
A DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF CONGRESS.

136
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:46,121
SHE CLAIMS THAT THOSE CLAIMS

137
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:47,489
COME BACK AFTER NEARLY FOUR

138
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:48,724
DECADES AND I'VE BEEN SAYING,

139
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:51,160
SHE DESERVED TO BE HEARD FROM

140
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,693
THE VERY BEGINNING.

141
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:52,661
THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE SERIOUS

142
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:54,296
AND HAVE BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY

143
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:57,900
THE PRESIDENT, THE SENATE AND BY

144
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,101
EVERYBODY.

145
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:00,569
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER A DATE, DAY

146
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:02,171
OF THE WEEK LOCATION, OR HOW SHE

147
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:02,905
GOT TO OR FROM THE PARTY WHERE

148
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:06,175
THE ALLEGED CRIME TOOK PLACE.

149
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,876
ALL OF THE WITNESSES THAT

150
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:10,646
PROFESSOR FORD CORROBORATED WITH

151
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:13,248
HER CLAIMS, THEY ALL DENIED THAT

152
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:14,283
SHE WAS ALLEGING.

153
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:15,450
ALL FOUR WITH SWORN STATEMENTS

154
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,253
UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY.

155
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:19,054
ALL WITNESSES HAVE GIVEN SWORN

156
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:21,290
STATEMENTS UNDER THE PENALTY OF

157
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,457
FELON, COULD FELONY MEANING YOU

158
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:24,626
COULD GO TO JAIL, TO THE

159
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:24,993
DEMOCRATS.

160
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:28,163
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THIS HAS

161
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:29,965
BEEN INVESTIGATED AND THE PEOPLE

162
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:32,301
THERE HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN.

163
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:34,103
THAT INCLUDES PROFESSOR FORD'S

164
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:36,105
FRIEND, HER NAME, LELAND KEISER.

165
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:37,506
HER ATTORNEY RELEASED A

TODAY THE SENATE'S INDEPENDENT

00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,855
PROSECUTOR ASKED HER ABOUT THIS

180
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:53,356
IRREFUTABLE FACT.

181
00:05:53,356 --> 00:05:55,191
TAKE A LOOK.

182
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:57,293
>> ARE YOU AWARE THAT THEY SAY

183
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:59,829
THEY HAVE NO MEMORY OR KNOWLEDGE

184
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:01,831
OF SUCH A PARTY?

185
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:03,266
>> YES.

186
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:07,703
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR

187
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:08,404
MOTIVES TO ASCRIBE TO LELAND?

188
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:13,543
>> I COULD TAKE THOSE ONE AT A

189
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:15,778
TIME.

190
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:18,247
LELAND HAS SIGNIFICANT HEALTH

191
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:18,948
CHALLENGES AND I'M HAPPY THAT

192
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:21,851
SHE'S FOCUSING ON HERSELF AND

193
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:22,585
GETTING THESE HEALTH TREATMENTS

194
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:24,855
THAT SHE NEEDS.

195
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:26,456
SHE LET ME KNOW THAT SHE NEEDED

196
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:28,491
HER LAWYER TO TAKE CARE OF THIS

197
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,827
FOR HER, AND SHE TEXTED ME RIGHT

198
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:34,698
AFTERWARD WITH AN APOLOGY, AND

199
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:35,498
GOOD WISHES AND ET CETERA.

200
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:38,235
SO I'M GLAD SHE'S TAKING CARE OF

201
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:38,568
HERSELF.

202
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:40,503
>> THAT IS TESTIMONY FROM

203
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:41,538
PROFESSOR FORD WHICH ACTUALLY

204
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:43,306
RAISE MORE QUESTIONS THAN IT

205
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:45,108
ANSWERED, INCLUDING THIS MOMENT

206
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:47,210
ABOUT FORD'S RECENT POLYGRAPH

207
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,078
TEST.

208
00:06:48,078 --> 00:06:48,645
LET'S LOOK AT THIS.

209
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:51,281
>> WHY WAS THAT LOCATION CHOSEN

210
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:52,716
FOR THE POLYGRAPH?

211
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:55,285
>> I HAD LEFT MY GRANDMOTHER'S

212
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:56,052
FUNERAL AT FORT LINCOLN CEMETERY

213
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:57,654
THAT DAY AND I WAS ON A TIGHT

214
00:06:57,654 --> 00:07:01,291
SCHEDULE TO GET A PLANE TO

215
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,058
MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE, SO HE

216
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:03,693
WAS WILLING TO COME TO ME WHICH

217
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:08,131
IS APPRECIATED.

218
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:09,299
>> SO HE ADMINISTERED A

219
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:11,034
POLYGRAPH ON THE DAY THAT YOU

220
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:13,003
ATTENDED YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S

221
00:07:13,003 --> 00:07:13,370
FUNERAL?

222
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,671
>> CORRECT.

223
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:16,172
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NEXT DAY,

224
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:19,776
I SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE HOTEL.

225
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:21,011
NOT SURE OF THE EXACT DAY.

226
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:23,880
>> DID YOU PAY FOR THE POLYGRAPH

227
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,848
YOURSELF?

228
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:26,116
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

229
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:28,718
>> DO YOU KNOW WHO DID PAY FOR

230
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:29,286
THE POLYGRAPH?

231
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:31,321
>> NOT YET, NO.

232
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:35,091
>> I BELIEVE YOU SAID IT HADN'T

233
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:37,494
BEEN PAID FOR YET, IS THAT

234
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:37,827
CORRECT?

235
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:39,396
>> LET ME PUT AN END TO THIS

236
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:39,729
MISERY.

237
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:43,533
HER LAWYERS HAVE PAID FOR HER

238
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,603
POLYGRAPH.

239
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:48,505
>> AS IS ROUTINE.

240
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:50,774
>> AS HIS ROUTINE.

241
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:51,875
IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

242
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:52,676
SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO ASSIST

243
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:55,078
YOU WITH SOME OF THESE FEES

244
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:57,814
INCLUDING THE COST FOR YOUR

245
00:07:57,814 --> 00:07:58,315
POLYGRAPH?

246
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:00,283
>> I'M AWARE THAT THERE HAVE

247
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:01,985
BEEN SEVERAL GO FIND ME SITES

248
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:03,119
THAT I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO

249
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:05,322
FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE THOSE,

250
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:06,856
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER HAD ONE.

251
00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:09,025
>> TO RECAP, PROFESSOR FORD

252
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:11,428
DOESN'T REMEMBER WHEN THE

253
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:13,430
INCIDENT HAPPENED AND SHE IS

254
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,132
GIVEN INCONSISTENT ANSWERS ABOUT

255
00:08:15,132 --> 00:08:16,500
THIS IMPORTANT DETAIL.

256
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,301
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHO

257
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:20,036
ATTENDED THE PARTY IN QUESTION.

258
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:22,105
SHE HAS GIVEN INCONSISTENT

259
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:23,373
ANSWERS ABOUT THIS DETAIL AND

260
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:25,208
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER HOW SHE GOT

261
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,009
TO THE ALLEGED PARTY.

262
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:26,776
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER HOW SHE GOT

263
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:31,448
BACK FROM THE PARTY AND NOT ONE

264
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:32,716
PERSON CORROBORATES HER STORY.

265
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:34,049
WE ALSO LEARNED TODAY SHE

266
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,818
DOESN'T REMEMBER IF SHE HANDED

267
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:36,886
"THE WASHINGTON POST" THERAPY

268
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:38,922
NOTES JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO.

269
00:08:38,922 --> 00:08:41,691
JUST MINUTES AGO,

270
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:42,325
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"

271
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:43,058
EDITORIAL BOARD FULLY ENDORSED

272
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:43,927
THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE BRETT

273
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:44,661
KAVANAUGH AND ALSO MOMENTS AGO

274
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:48,431
WE LEARNED THAT SENATOR MITCH

275
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:49,499
McCONNELL ANNOUNCED THE SENATE

276
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:54,337
JUDICIAL COMMITTEE THEY ARE

277
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:57,107
MOVING FORWARD HE SAID.

278
00:08:57,107 --> 00:08:58,708
AND MOMENTS AGO, SENATOR BOB

279
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,910
CORKER OF TENNESSEE ANNOUNCED ON

280
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,844
TWITTER THAT HE WILL VOTE YES ON

281
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:04,748
BRETT KAVANAUGH.

282
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:08,118
TWO PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT

283
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:11,688
SHOULDN'T BE ABOUT DEMOCRAT,

284
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:13,290
REPUBLICAN OR LIBERAL

285
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,258
CONSERVATIVE AT ALL.

286
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:16,560
THEY WANTED TO RUIN JUDGE BRETT

287
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,763
KAVANAUGH, AND UNSUBSTANTIATED

288
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:20,831
AND UNCORROBORATED CLAIMS FROM

289
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:24,334
NEARLY FOUR DECADES AGO.

290
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,103
FROM THE LEFT AT THIS POINT,

291
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:26,970
IT'S NOT ABOUT

292
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,905
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.

293
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:29,473
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE TALKING

294
00:09:29,473 --> 00:09:30,040
ABOUT KEITH ELLISON.

295
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,076
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD MORE ARE

296
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:33,777
STATEMENTS ABOUT BILL CLINTON.

297
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:36,313
THIS HAS NOT BEEN ABOUT

298
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:38,315
PROTECTING VICTIMS OR FINDING

299
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:39,049
THE TRUTH.

300
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:41,518
FOR THEM, DAY ONE WITH

301
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:43,287
CHUCK SCHUMER LEAVING THE WAY,

302
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:44,922
IT'S A SAD DAY FOR THE COUNTRY

303
00:09:44,922 --> 00:09:46,190
AND WHAT WE HAD TO WITNESS

304
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:46,490
TODAY.

305
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,927
THE WORST PART OF THIS IS,

306
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:51,495
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN KNEW

307
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:53,897
ABOUT THESE CLAIMS SINCE JULY.

308
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:54,598
SHE KNEW ABOUT THESE CHARGES

309
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:58,302
WHEN SHE ACTUALLY MET WITH

310
00:09:58,302 --> 00:09:59,069
KAVANAUGH IN PRIVATE.

311
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:00,371
SHE KNEW ABOUT THESE CLAIMS WHEN

312
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:02,139
SHE QUESTIONED HIM DURING HIS

313
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,807
PUBLIC HEARING SEVERAL WEEKS

314
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:04,508
AGO.

315
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:05,409
WHEN SHE MET PRIVATELY WITH

316
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:07,111
BRETT KAVANAUGH, SHE HAD ALREADY

317
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:10,714
BEEN RECOMMENDING ATTORNEYS TO

318
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:13,183
PROFESSOR FORD.

319
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:14,084
ONLY AFTER BRETT KAVANAUGH'S

320
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:15,119
NOMINATION LOOKED IMMINENT DID

321
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:16,320
DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND DEMOCRATS

322
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,390
ANNOUNCE FORD'S ALLEGATIONS.

323
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,359
THIS HAS BEEN A DISGRACEFUL

324
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:25,229
DISPLAY OF POLITICS AT ITS WORS

325
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:25,529
WORST.

326
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,831
HIS REELECTION MORE IMPORTANT

327
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:31,869
THEN ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE HERE?

328
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:33,304
DID ANYONE HEAR THE PAIN IN

329
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:36,907
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S VOICE TODAY?

330
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:39,243
AND I WOULD ARGUE TOO, PROFESSOR

331
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:40,511
FORD TO COME UP AS SUSAN COLLINS

332
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,713
HAS SAID IT, NOBODY HAS BEEN

333
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:46,317
SERVED WELL HERE.

334
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:48,719
THE STORY GOT LEAKED, HER NAME

335
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,121
GOT LEAKED AND WITHOUT ANY

336
00:10:50,121 --> 00:10:51,689
CORROBORATION OR EVIDENCE, THEN

337
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:53,657
YOU HAVE POLITICIANS SMEARING

338
00:10:53,657 --> 00:10:54,392
CAVANAUGH AGAIN AND AGAIN ON

339
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,761
NATIONAL TV.

340
00:10:56,761 --> 00:11:00,865
AND THIS IS JUST A SMALL

341
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:01,232
SAMPLING.

342
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:03,601
>> THE SENATE SHOULDN'T SIMPLY

343
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:06,170
RELY ON HEARING TWO CONFLICTING

344
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,339
ACCOUNTS, AND WE ARE OKAY WITH

345
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,709
NOT KNOWING AND WE MIGHT BE

346
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,277
PUTTING SOMEONE WHO COMMITTED

347
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:14,912
ATTEMPTED RAPE ON THE SOUTHERN

348
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:15,580
COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.

349
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,715
>> I BELIEVE HER.

350
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:19,784
LISTEN, FIRST OF ALL, ANYONE WHO

351
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:21,853
COMES FORWARD AT THIS POINT TO

352
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:23,387
BE PREPARED TO TESTIFY IN THE

353
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:24,522
UNITED STATES SENATE AGAINST

354
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:26,124
SOMEONE WHO IS BEING NOMINATED

355
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:27,892
TO ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL

356
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:29,293
POSITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

357
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:30,328
GOVERNMENT, THAT TAKES AN

358
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:32,397
EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF COURAGE.

359
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:34,699
>> NOT ONLY DO WOMEN LIKE

360
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:36,501
DR. FORD WHO BRAVELY COME

361
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:37,235
FORWARD NEED TO BE HEARD, BUT

362
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:44,342
THEY NEED TO BE BELIEVED.

363
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:46,778
>> I WANT TO SAY THAT TO THE MEN

364
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:47,645
OF THIS COUNTRY, JUST SHUT UP

365
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:49,380
AND STEP UP AND DO THE RIGHT

366
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,681
THING.

367
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:52,016
>> LET ME SAY AT THE OUTSET, I

368
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:54,119
BELIEVE DR. FORD, I BELIEVE THE

369
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,253
SURVIVOR HERE, THERE IS EVERY

370
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:58,523
REASON TO BELIEVE HER.

371
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:03,061
SHE'S COME FORWARD BRAVELY.

372
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:07,665
>> >> I DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD

373
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:09,467
BE BULLIED INTO THIS SCENARIO,

374
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:12,036
OR IS HE SAID, SHE SAID.

375
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:13,338
IT'S A SHAME HEARING.

376
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:15,140
>> I BELIEVE PROFESSOR FORD.

377
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,841
I THINK SHE'S CREDIBLE AND I

378
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,977
THINK WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS

379
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:22,914
FINISHED, AND WHEN SHE TESTIFIE

380
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:23,548
TESTIFIES, AND WHEN JUDGE

381
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:25,517
KAVANAUGH TESTIFIES, I THINK THE

382
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,318
MAJORITY OF SENATORS WILL FIND

383
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:30,288
HER CREDIBLE.

384
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:31,456
>> Sean: THE SMEARS CONTINUED

385
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:32,891
DURING THE HEARING AND TODAY

386
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:34,159
DEMOCRATS RAMPING UP THEIR

387
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,461
FAVORITE NEW TALKING POINT.

388
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:38,329
WE MUST HAVE AN FBI

389
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:39,130
INVESTIGATION.

390
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,199
NOW, THIS IS OF COURSE ALL A

391
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:43,201
POLITICAL STALL TACTIC.

392
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:45,704
THEY WANT DELAY, DELAY, DELAY.

393
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:47,539
THE HOPE WE GET TO THE MIDTERMS,

394
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,808
THEY HOPE THEY WIN AND THEY HOPE

395
00:12:49,808 --> 00:12:50,475
THEY STOP DONALD TRUMP FROM

396
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:52,711
FULFILLING A CAMPAIGN PROMISE

397
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:56,314
AND CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION.

398
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:57,249
WATCH THE ECHO CHAMBER AND ON

399
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:59,317
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS, I WILL

400
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:01,486
EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS PHONY, AND

401
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:01,920
THEY KNOW IT.

402
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,055
TAKE A LOOK.

403
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:04,656
>> Judge Kavanaugh: THE

404
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:05,891
BEHAVIOR OF SEVERAL DEMOCRATIC

405
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:08,193
EMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE A FEW

406
00:13:08,193 --> 00:13:09,828
WEEKS AGO AT MY HEARING WAS AN

407
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:10,529
EMBARRASSMENT, BUT AT LEAST IT

408
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:13,999
WAS JUST AN OLD-FASHIONED

409
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:20,539
ATTEMPTS AT BORKING.

410
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:22,441
WHEN I DID OKAY AT THE HEARINGS

411
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:23,775
ENOUGH TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE I

412
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:25,744
MIGHT GET CONFIRMED, NEW TACTICS

413
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:26,511
WERE NEEDED.

414
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:28,413
SOME OF YOU WERE LYING IN WAIT,

415
00:13:28,413 --> 00:13:29,314
AND HAD IT READY.

416
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:32,284
THIS FIRST ALLEGATION WAS HELD

417
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:33,518
IN SECRET FOR WEEKS BY A

418
00:13:33,518 --> 00:13:34,786
DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THIS

419
00:13:34,786 --> 00:13:36,355
COMMITTEE AND BY STAFF.

420
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:40,525
IT WOULD BE NEEDED ONLY IF YOU

421
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:42,327
COULDN'T TAKE ME OUT ON THE

422
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:43,128
MERITS.

423
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:45,130
WHEN IT WAS NEEDED, THIS

424
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,599
ALLEGATION WAS UNLEASHED AND

425
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,735
PUBLICLY DEPLOYED OVER

426
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:51,236
DR. FORD'S WISHES.

427
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:53,338
THIS WHOLE TWO-WEEK EFFORT HAS

428
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:54,873
BEEN A CALCULATED AND

429
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:57,109
ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT.

430
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:59,912
FUELED WITH A PARENT PENT UP

431
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:03,982
ANGER ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

432
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:05,784
THE 2016 ELECTION, I FEAR THAT

433
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:06,552
HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY STOKED ABOUT

434
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:10,723
MY JUDICIAL RECORD, REVENGE ON

435
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:13,659
BEHALF OF THE CLINTONS, AND

436
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,094
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MONEY

437
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:15,661
FROM OUTSIDE LEFT-WING

438
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:19,131
OPPOSITION GROUPS.

439
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:23,302
THIS IS A CIRCUS.

440
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:24,737
THE CONSEQUENCES WILL EXTEND

441
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:27,039
LONG PAST MY NOMINATION.

442
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,907
THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE WITH US

443
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:31,410
FOR DECADES.

444
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,479
>> Sean: AN FBI INVESTIGATION

445
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:35,714
DOES NOT MAKE CONCLUSIONS, THEY

446
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:36,181
ALL KNEW THIS.

447
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:38,984
THEY INTERVIEWED EVERYBODY THAT

448
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:39,718
HAS ALREADY BEEN INTERVIEWED AND

449
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:43,122
A REPORT WOULD THEN BE ISSUED.

450
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:48,727
THE DEMOCRATS KNOW IT THE

451
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:49,929
INVESTIGATIONS ARE ACTUALLY

452
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,730
USELESS, AS WORDS, AND THEY ALL

453
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,299
AGREED BACK THEN.

454
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:53,933
TAKE A LOOK.

455
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,334
>> THE NEXT PERSON THAT REFERS

456
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:58,504
TO AN FBI REPORT AS BEING WORTH

457
00:14:58,504 --> 00:14:59,138
ANYTHING OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T

458
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:02,675
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

459
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:08,180
FBI EXPLICITLY DOES NOT IN THIS

460
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,249
OR ANY OTHER CASE REACH A

461
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:12,785
CONCLUSION.

462
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:16,589
PERIOD.

463
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:18,324
SO JUDGE, THERE'S NO REASON WHY

464
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:19,325
YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS.

465
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:21,260
THE REASON WHY WE CAN'T RELY ON

466
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,962
THE FBI REPORT, HE WOULD LIKE IT

467
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:27,166
IF WE DID BECAUSE IT IS

468
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,002
INCONCLUSIVE.

469
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:34,140
THEY SAY HE SAID, SHE SAID AND

470
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,741
THEY SAID, PERIOD.

471
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:38,144
SO WHEN PEOPLE WAIVE AN FBI

472
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:41,514
REPORT BEFORE YOU, UNDERSTAND,

473
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:43,482
THEY DO NOT.

474
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:46,986
THEY DO NOT REACH CONCLUSIONS.

475
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:49,722
THEY DO NOT MAKE, AS MY FRIEND

476
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:51,557
POINTS OUT MORE ADEQUATELY, THEY

477
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:54,327
DO NOT MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS.

478
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:55,328
>> Sean: IT REMEMBER ALL

479
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,596
WITNESSES IN THIS CASE GAVE

480
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:58,531
SWORN STATEMENTS UNDER THE

481
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:00,032
THREAT OF FELONY.

482
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:02,001
DEMOCRATS HAVE TURNED THIS

483
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,136
IMPORTANT PROCESS INTO A

484
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:03,770
POLITICAL SHAM.

485
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:08,007
THEY HAVE TURNED ADVICE AND

486
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,910
CONSENT INTO DESTROY AND MALIGN.

487
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,912
THEY CAN'T CARE WHOSE LIFE IS

488
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:14,247
DESTROYED IN THIS PROCESS,

489
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:14,947
OBVIOUSLY THEY DON'T.

490
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:18,118
DID THEY NOT SEE WHAT WENT ON

491
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:19,619
TODAY, TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH?

492
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:21,354
THE IMPACT ON HIM AND HIS

493
00:16:21,354 --> 00:16:21,688
FAMILY?

494
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:22,355
THE WOMEN MAKING THESE

495
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:23,757
ALLEGATIONS AS THEY WITHHELD

496
00:16:23,757 --> 00:16:24,858
THEM FOR ALL THESE WEEKS?

497
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,728
THEY JUST WANT CAVANAUGH STOPPED

498
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:29,162
AT ALL COSTS.

499
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:31,364
NO ONE SEEMS TO PUT THIS IN

500
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:32,365
BETTER PERSPECTIVE THAN

501
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:37,904
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM.

502
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:41,107
AND PLEASE TAKE A LOOK.

503
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:47,580
>> I HOPE YOU WIN IN 2020, AND

504
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,517
YOU SAID THAT, NOT ME.

505
00:16:50,517 --> 00:16:51,518
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE

506
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:51,785
FOR.

507
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:56,256
WHEN YOU SEE JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR

508
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:59,125
OR AND KAGAN, I VOTED FOR THEM

509
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,760
BUT I WOULD NEVER DO TO THEM

510
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,929
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO THIS GUY.

511
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:05,932
THIS IS THE MOST UNETHICAL SHAM

512
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:07,934
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS.

513
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,234
I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT YOU AND

514
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:12,305
YOUR FAMILY HAVE GONE THROUGH.

515
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:13,940
YOU ALL WANT POWER, I HOPE YOU

516
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,941
NEVER GET IT.

517
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:17,310
I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN

518
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,645
SEE THROUGH THE SHAM, THAT YOU

519
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:21,281
KNEW ABOUT IT AND YOU HELD IT.

520
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:22,281
YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF

521
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:25,318
PROTECTING DR. FORD.

522
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:25,618
NONE.

523
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:28,521
SHE'S AS MUCH OF A VICTIM AS YOU

524
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:28,789
ARE.

525
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:30,691
GOD, I HATE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE

526
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:31,458
THESE HAVE BEEN MY FRIENDS, BUT

527
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,261
LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN IT COMES

528
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,130
TO THIS, YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A

529
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:37,564
FAIR PROCESS?

530
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:39,266
YOU CAME TO THE WRONG TOWN AT

531
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,102
THE WRONG TIME, MY FRIEND.

532
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,037
TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IF

533
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:48,942
YOU VOTE NO, YOU ARE

534
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:49,710
LEGITIMIZING THE MOST DESPICABLE

535
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,511
THING I HAVE SEEN IN MY TIME IN

536
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:53,447
POLITICS.

537
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,082
>> Sean: SENATOR GRAHAM WILL

538
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:56,917
JOIN US IN STUDIO IN JUST A

539
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,318
MOMENT, AND AFTER THOSE

540
00:17:58,318 --> 00:17:59,353
PASSIONATE REMARKS,

541
00:17:59,353 --> 00:18:00,120
SENATOR ORRIN HATCH CALLED THESE

542
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,154
PROCEEDINGS WORSE THAN ANY OTHER

543
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:03,490
CONFIRMATION PROCEEDINGS IN

544
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,358
HISTORY, INCLUDING THOSE OF

545
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:06,026
JUDGE BORK AND JUDGE THOMAS.

546
00:18:06,026 --> 00:18:07,761
LET'S WATCH THIS.

547
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:09,796
>> OF THE CIRCUS ATMOSPHERE THAT

548
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:11,331
HAS BEEN CREATED SINCE MY

549
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:12,766
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES FIRST

550
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:13,734
LEAKED DR. FORD'S ALLEGATIONS TO

551
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:17,137
THE MEDIA TWO WEEKS AGO, AFTER

552
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,339
SITTING ON THEM FOR SIX WEEKS, I

553
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:21,308
MIGHT ADD IT, HAS BROUGHT US THE

554
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,844
WORST IN OUR POLITICS.

555
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:25,045
IT CERTAINLY HAS BROUGHT US NO

556
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:28,649
CLOSER TO THE TRUTH, ANONYMOUS

557
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,549
LETTERS WITH NO NAME AND NO

558
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:30,951
RETURN ADDRESS ARE NOT BEING

559
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:38,125
TREATED AS NATIONAL NEWS.

560
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,927
LAWYERS WITH FACIALLY

561
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:40,661
IMPLAUSIBLE CLAIMS ARE DRIVING

562
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,130
THE NEW CYCLE.

563
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,932
I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT THIS IS

564
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:45,833
WORSE THAN ROBERT BORK AND I

565
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,601
DIDN'T THINK IT COULD GET WORSE

566
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:48,102
THAN THAT.

567
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:49,136
THIS IS WORSE THAN CLARENCE

568
00:18:49,136 --> 00:18:50,104
THOMAS AND I DIDN'T THINK IT

569
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:52,339
COULD GET WORSE THAN THAT.

570
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,141
THIS IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE, THE

571
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:55,743
WAY YOU ARE BEING TREATED.

572
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,645
>> Sean: THIS IS SADLY THE

573
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:58,178
DEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK.

574
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,749
I WARN PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE TWO

575
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:03,350
OR FOUR YEARS ON A RADIO SHOW

576
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,720
AND RIGHT HERE ON THE SHOW,

577
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,590
REPUBLICANS, BE PREPARED TO BE

578
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,092
DEMONIZED, RACIST, SEXIST,

579
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,761
MISOGYNIST, ISLAMOPHOBIC, XENA

580
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:14,828
PHOBIC, YOU WANT DIRTY AIR AND

581
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:16,363
WATER AND YOU WANT TO KILL

582
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,665
CHILDREN AND THEIR SON PAUL RYAN

583
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:19,667
LOOK A LIKE THROWING YOUR

584
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:20,534
GRANDMOTHER OVER THE CLIFF

585
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,535
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS WANT GRANNY

586
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,136
TO DIE.

587
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:24,138
IT'S THE SAME NOW WITH

588
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:25,172
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES, SAME

589
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:26,941
PREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR.

590
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:29,376
WE HAVE NOW COME TO EXPECT THIS.

591
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,745
THIS HAS TO CHANGE, THIS COUNTRY

592
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:32,346
DESERVES BETTER.

593
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:33,914
THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY

594
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:34,381
DESERVE BETTER.

595
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,151
THESE PEOPLE IN D.C., AND THIS

596
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:38,552
SWAMP, THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO

597
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,922
SERVE US, YOU, WE COME AT THE

598
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:42,289
PEOPLE.

599
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:44,325
IT'S NOT ABOUT A REPUBLICAN,

600
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:44,892
DEMOCRAT, LIBERAL OR

601
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,795
CONSERVATIVE HERE, THIS IS PURE

602
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:49,163
HUMAN DECENCY THAT WAS IN PLAY

603
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:51,065
TODAY.

604
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,000
THEY DESTROYED THIS MAN AND HIS

605
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,334
FAMILY.

606
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:55,603
THEY BLUDGEONED HIM, ALL FOR THE

607
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:58,472
SAKE OF POWER.

608
00:19:58,472 --> 00:20:00,441
THERE WAS ZERO PRESUMPTION OF

609
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:03,344
INNOCENCE HERE OR DUE PROCESS.

610
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:05,112
NOW THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, EVERY

611
00:20:05,112 --> 00:20:07,148
2-4 YEARS, EVERY TIME WE HAVE A

612
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:09,183
NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT,

613
00:20:09,183 --> 00:20:11,119
WE KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.

614
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,755
THE PARTY OF SLANDER, BESMIRCH

615
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,356
MEANT, SMEARS, CHARACTER

616
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:16,791
ASSASSINATION, THE PARTY OF NO

617
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,726
DUE PROCESS, NO PRESUMPTION OF

618
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:19,093
INNOCENCE.

619
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,962
THE PARTY THAT RUSHES TO

620
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:21,329
JUDGMENT.

621
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,531
LOOK AT ALL THE HIGH PROFILE

622
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:24,165
CASES RUSHED TO JUDGMENT.

623
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:28,035
THE DUKE LACROSSE CLICK CASE,

624
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:31,773
CAMBRIDGE POLICE, BALTIMORE,

625
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,941
MARYLAND, RICHARD JEWELL, TRAVE

626
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,342
ON MARTIN.

627
00:20:34,342 --> 00:20:35,410
IS THIS THE PARTY THAT IS GOING

628
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,145
TO DECIDE THE FATE OF THIS

629
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:37,545
COUNTRY?

630
00:20:37,545 --> 00:20:39,414
BECAUSE IN 40 DAYS, THAT SAME

631
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:40,114
PARTY WANTS YOU TO GO OUT AND

632
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,150
VOTE FOR THEM.

633
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,552
LOOK AT YOUR SCREEN.

634
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:45,520
USING THESE REPUBLICAN SENATORS?

635
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,254
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL

636
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:51,559
DECIDE THE FATE OF THE KAVANAUGH

637
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:51,960
NOMINATION.

00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:53,628
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WILL

640
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,363
DECIDE IF WE STILL HAVE DUE

641
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:56,931
PROCESS IN THIS COUNTRY.

642
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:57,632
IF THESE PRINCIPLES EXIST IN

643
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,735
THIS COUNTRY, IF WE STILL HAVE

644
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:02,504

645
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:05,340
CONSTITUTION, LET THEM KNOW HOW

KAVANAUGH AND THEY GO ALONG WITH

659
00:21:29,764 --> 00:21:30,932

DECISIONS.

672
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:51,553
NEVER HAS A SUPREME COURT

673
00:21:51,553 --> 00:21:53,154
NOMINATION BEEN MORE IMPORTANT.

674
00:21:53,154 --> 00:21:55,457
THIS COUNTRY IS AT A TIPPING

675
00:21:55,457 --> 00:21:56,357
POINT.

676
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,125
INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF AMERICANS

677
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,360
