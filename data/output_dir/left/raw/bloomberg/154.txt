DRONE STRAIGHT WE WILL DISCUSS

13
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:28,695
THE LATEST REGULATION AS

16
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,967

31
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,224

BILLION IN TAXES, EUROPE'S

LARGEST PENALTY EVER.

36
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,267
THIS WOULD CULMINATE A

00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,034
THREE-YEAR INVESTIGATION INTO

38
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:08,768
WHETHER IRELAND GAVE APPLE A

39
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:09,502
SWEETHEART DEAL IN RETURN FOR

40
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,371
CREATING JOBS THERE.

00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,139
JOINING ME TO DISCUSS, A SENIOR

00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:19,879
REACH -- RESEARCH ANALYST,

43
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,713
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA PROFESSOR,

44
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,315
AN EXPERT IN INTERNATIONAL TAX

45

48
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:30,757
ALEX, $19 BILLION, I BELIEVE

49
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,524
THAT'S WHAT A J.P. MORGAN

50
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:35,662
ANALYST CAME UP WITH.

51
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:36,262
VASTLY DIFFERENT.

52
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,063
WHAT ARE WE LIKELY TO SEE HERE?

53
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:40,333
>> THIS $19 BILLION FIGURE HAS

54
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:44,504
BEEN AROUND FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.

55
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,572
THE IRISH TIMES LIKELY REVISE

56
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:47,173
THE FIGURE UP A BIT.

57
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:47,874
WE THINK IT WILL BE IN THE

58
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,542
HANDFUL OF BILLIONS, POSSIBLY.

59
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:53,146
SOURCES AT THIS STAGE, WE HAVE

60
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,981
TO SEE WHAT THE ACTION NUMBER IS

61
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:55,782
WHEN WE WAKE UP TOMORROW ON THE

62
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,215
WEST COAST.

63
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:56,983
EMILY: HOW ARE YOU MODELING THIS

64
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:57,584
OUT?

65
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,951
WHAT IS LIKELY SCENARIO?

66
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:05,224
>> THE WORSE CASE AND AREA IS

67
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:06,960
$19 BILLION, IF THAT HAPPENS, IT

68
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,794
IS ABOUT 12% OF THE AVAILABLE

69
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,527
CASH FOR APPLE.

70
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:12,999
THE NUMBER IS A HUGE NUMBER, BUT

71
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:13,866
SOMETHING INVESTORS DON'T GIVE

72
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:14,634
APPLE MUCH CREDIT FOR THEIR CASH

73
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,970
ANYWAY.

74
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,439
IN SOME RESPECTS, IT'S A GREAT

75
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,441
THING TO WATCH BUT REALLY

76
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,308
DOESN'T IMPACT THE VALUATION ON

77
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:22,775
THE STORY.

78
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,444
THAT'S HOW WE WOULD THINK ABOUT

79
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,678
IT, WE ARE PLAYING FOR THE

80
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,847
WORST-CASE AND THINKING IT IS A

81
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:28,548
12% HIT TO THEIR CASH.

82
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,818
EMILY: YOU ARE SAYING THAT

83
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,652
WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS UNLIKELY.

84
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,686
WHY?

85
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:37,891
>> A BIG ISSUE IS IF THE

86
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:42,562
EUROPEANS PLAY HARDBALL TOO MUCH

87
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,463
, IT'S GOING TO DETER APPLE AND

88
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,598
OTHER COMPANIES FROM REPORTING

89
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,737
ANY TAXABLE INCOME IN EUROPE.

90
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,472
ONE ANALOGY WOULD BE IN IOWA

91
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,541
CORN FARMER WHO FOLLOWS HIS CORN

92
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,945
TO MEXICO, IF THE MEXICANS TRY

93
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:03,416
AND TAX THE IOWA CORN FARMER,

94
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,884
WHAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION FOR

95
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:05,351
THAT.

96
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,285
THERE'S AN ANALOGY HERE, WHY ARE

97
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:08,755
THE EUROPEANS TAXING THE INCOME

98
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,023
OF AN AMERICAN CORPORATION?

99
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:15,662
EMILY: ON THAT NOTE, THE U.S.

100
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:16,462
GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED UP ITS

101
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,263
RHETORIC IN DEFENSE OF APPLE.

102
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:23,136
TALKING ABOUT IRELAND BEING A

00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,605
SUPER NATIONAL TAX AUTHORITY,

MAYBE INDICATING THEY ARE

105
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:26,973
OVERSTEPPING THEIR BOUNDS.

106
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:31,043
THIS ISSUE OF WHETHER U.S.

107
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:32,412
COMPANIES HAVE HAD TAX HAVENS IN

108
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,212
EUROPE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A

109
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,214
LONG TIME, AND DEFRAUDING THE

110
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:35,982
U.S. GOVERNMENT OF BILLIONS OF

111
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:36,382
DOLLARS.

112
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:42,088
>> IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THE U.S.

113
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,089
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT APPLE TO

114
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:43,656
PAY TAX.

115
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,490
HE WANTS IT TO PAY ITS TAX HERE

116
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,191
IN THE U.S.

117
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:50,897
THAT IS IS WHY IT IS HARD

118
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,697
FALLING IN THE AMERICAN SENSE

119
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:52,498
AGAINST THE EUROPEAN AUTHORITIES

120
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,200
AND AGAINST IRELAND, BECAUSE IT

121
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,001
WANTS THAT MONEY TO GO INTO U.S.

122
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,368
COFFERS.

123
00:03:55,368 --> 00:04:01,641
EMILY: WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR READ

124
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,475
ON THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION OF

125
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,242
HOW SERIOUS IT CAN BE FOR APPLE?

126
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,344
AND NOT JUST APPLE, BUT OTHER

127
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:05,945
U.S. TECH COMPANIES.

128
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:09,415
>> FROM A VALUATION PERSPECTIVE

129
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,019
ON THE SCALE OF 1 TO 10, 10

130
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:13,920
BEING REALLY BAD, IT'S PROBABLY

131
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,357
A 2 OR 3.

132
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,858
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL

133
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,526
IMPACT SOME OF THEIR CASH.

134
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,260
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT GETTING

135
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,329
CASH BACK TO THE U.S.

136
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,331
THAT'S THE AND GOAL ULTIMATELY

137
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,165
FOR APPLE, AND THERE NEEDS TO BE

138
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,267
SOME SORT OF TAG FOR IT.

139
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:33,406
THIS IS 2 OR 3 IN TERMS OF

140
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:33,873
SEVERITY.

141
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:34,607
ULTIMATELY THEY WILL HAVE SOME

142
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,509
SMALL FINE AND HOPEFULLY IN THE

143
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,343
NEXT PRESIDENTIAL CYCLE WE WILL

144
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,311
HAVE SOME TAX HOLIDAY WHERE

145
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,979
APPLICANTS WILL BRING IT ACT MAY

146
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,083
BE AT 20%, -- BACK MAYBE A 20%,

147
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,051
SOMETHING MORE REASONABLE.

148
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:49,222
EMILY: THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

WHAT SORT OF CASCADING ISSUES

153
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,830
COULD YOU SEE AFTER WE GET THIS

154
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,598
DECISION FROM THE EUROPEAN

155
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,065
COMMISSION?

156
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:03,569
>> ONE ISSUE IS THAT ANY TAXES

157
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,340
PAID IN EUROPE ARE A CREDIT

158
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,410
AGAINST U.S. TAXES.

159
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,345
THERE IS COMMENTED ABOUT

160
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,546
DEFRAUDING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

161
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,347
I THINK THAT'S TOO STRONG.

162
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:18,885
THIS IS TAX DEFERRAL.

163
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:19,719
ANY TAXES PAID IN EUROPE WOULD

164
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:23,356
BE A CREDIT AGAINST FUTURE U.S.

165
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,257
TAXES, AND THAT'S ONE REASON THE

166
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:28,628
U.S. GOVERNMENT ISN'T IN FAVOR

167
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,462
OF APPLE PAYING MORE TAXES IN

168
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,565
EUROPE BECAUSE EVENTUALLY IT'S

169
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:33,332
GOING TO RESULT IN LESS TAXES

170
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,066

00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,778
THAT EUROPE RETAINS CONTROL OF

190
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,246
ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS OF

191
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:20,646
POLICY.

192
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,349
TAX IS ONE OF THEM.

193
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,283
TRYING TO ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T

194
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,051
DISINTEGRATE IN A REGULATORY

195
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:30,790
SENSE.

196
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,591
CENTRALIZING POWER AND STEPPING

197
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,658
AUTHORITY FOR EACH COMMISSIONER

198
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:37,330
-- THERE IS CERTAINLY AN ELEMENT

199
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,431
OF LIKE STAMPING HER AUTHORITY

200
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,734
ON THE REMIT.

201
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:47,073
EMILY: COULD USE A BROADER

202
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,840
INTERNATIONAL TAX REFORM AS A

203
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,341
RESULT OF THIS?

204
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:52,178
>> IT'S POSSIBLE.

205
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,012
ONE ANALOGY HERE IS THIS IS AN

206
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:57,583
INTRA-EUROPEAN ISSUE, JUST AS

207
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,384

ILLINOIS.

212
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,159
PARTLY THE EUROPEAN UNION IS

213
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:07,893
COMPLAINING THAT IRELAND IS

214
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:09,962
ASKING APPLE AND OTHER COMPANIES

215
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,731
TO PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THAN

216
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,799
GERMANY OR FRANCE.

217
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,967
SO, PARTLY THAT'S WHAT THIS IS

218
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:15,835
ALL ABOUT.

219
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:20,139
EMILY: ANY CHANCE APPLE WOULD

220
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:20,906
ACTUALLY EVER LEAVE IRELAND?

221
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:25,578
>> NO, I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO

222
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:26,912
HAPPEN HERE IS THERE'S GOING TO

223
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:27,913
BE SOME TWEAK IN TERMS OF HOW

224
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:35,254
THEY CHARGE U.S. COMPANIES.

225
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,289
THEY WILL PROBABLY STILL DO SOME

00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:38,024
THINGS THROUGH IRELAND AND A

227
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:38,858
YEAR FROM NOW WILL HAVE A HIGHER

228
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:39,659
TAX RATE AND MOVE FORWARD.

229
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,829
>> THE ONE THING IT POINTS OUT

230
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:44,830
FROM A BROADER EUROPEAN LEVEL IS

231
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,365
THE DIFFICULTY YOU HAVE IN THE

232
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,133
EUROPEAN UNION, THERE ARE SO

233
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,103
MANY DIFFERENT FISCAL REGIMES

234
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,105
ACROSS THE REGION, AND THAT

235
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:53,806
POINTS TO ONE OF THE BIG

236
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,473
PROBLEMS WITH THE WHOLE

237
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:57,376

00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:57,977
TO HAVE ANY SENSE OF

239
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,411

311
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,140
ON THE NEW IPHONE.

312
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,007
BASICALLY TWO CAMERAS THAT MERGE

MAYBE THEY WILL CALL FOR 7.

325
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,299
MAYBE THEY WILL CALL IT THE SE.

326
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,133
DESIGN WILL LOOK FAIRLY SIMILAR

327
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:52,238
TO THE IPHONE 6S AND IPHONE 6.

328
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:52,972
IT WILL HAVE A PRESSURE

329
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,507
SENSITIVE HOME BUTTON, WHICH

330
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:57,109
WILL VIBRATE IN REACTION TO HOW

331
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,077
HARD YOU PRESS ON IT.

332
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:58,811
THERE WILL BE THE NEW CAMERA

333
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,979
SYSTEM, WHICH HAS FAR BETTER

334
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:04,550
ZOOM AND A MUCH FASTER PROCESSOR

335
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,317
WHICH WORKS HAND-IN-HAND WITH

336
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,318
THE NEW CAMERA.

337
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,253
THERE WILL ALSO BE A NEW APPLE

338
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,557
WATCH.

339
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,458
HEALTH TRACKING FEATURES AS WELL

340
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,125
AS GPS FOR MORE ACCURATE

341
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,226

MARK'S STORIES.

YOU ALSO GET YOUR OWN SOURCES.

346
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,035

ARE EXPECTING, YOU IPHONES, NEW

348
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,474
APPLE WATCHES, NOT HUGE DESIGN

349
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,274

THE HEADPHONE JACK GETTING

354
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,919
REMOVED -- I DON'T THINK THAT

355
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,687
WILL CAUSE ANYBODY TO BUY AN

356
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,054
IPHONE.

357
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,390
IT'S ONE OF THOSE SECOND OR

358

THIRD LEVEL UPDATES.

359

AT THE END OF THE DAY, THERE IS

360
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,396
SOME IMPORTANT THINGS YOU CAN DO

361
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,430
WITH JUST A BETTER CAMERA.

362
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,832
IT CAN BE ANYTHING FROM JUST HOW

363
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,569
YOU TAKE PICTURES AND VIDEOS TO

364
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,705
THIS IDEA OF A DEVICE FOR

365
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:00,439
AUGMENTED REALITY, WHICH THE

366
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,240
WHOLE POKEMON THEME IS PLAYING

367
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,242
INTO.

368
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,076
THE GROUNDWORK FOR SOMETHING A

369
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:04,877
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN MIGHT BE AT

370
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:05,344
FIRST BLUSH.

371
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,747
EMILY: HOW ARE YOU MODELING OUT

372
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,684
A POTENTIAL BOOST IN SALES HERE?

373
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,485
OBVIOUSLY NO MAJOR DESIGN

374
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,220
CHANGES.

375
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,054
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LIKE THE

376
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:15,888
FACT THAT THERE'S NO HEADPHONE

377
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,555
JACK.

378
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,625
HOW MANY NEW IPHONES ARE THEY

379
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,359
ACTUALLY GOING TO SELL AS A

380
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,126
RESULT OF THESE UPDATES IN THE

381
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:21,627
FOURTH ORDER?

382
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,262
-- QUARTER?

383
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:28,867
>> WE THINK OF THIS AS A FOUR

384
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:29,401
QUARTER UPDATE.

385
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,169
IN TOTAL WE THINK THEY WILL SELL

386
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:30,969
235 MILLION PHONES OVER THE NEXT

387
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,705
YEAR.

388
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,706
TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE,

389
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,575
THIS WILL BE THE BIGGEST CYCLE,

390
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,143
THE BIGGEST WAVE OF PEOPLE WITH

391
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,746
OLD PHONES COMING INTO A CYCLE.

392
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,115
WE ESTIMATE THERE'S 275 MILLION

393
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:43,916
PEOPLE WHO HAVE PHONES THAT ARE

394
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,683
TWO YEARS OLD OR OLDER.

395
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:48,687
IN SOME WAYS, THIS IS NOT A VERY

396
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:49,988
EXCITING IPHONE UPGRADE.

397
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:50,756
THAT POOL OF REALLY OLD PHONES

398
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,790
SHOULD POWER THAT THROUGH.

399
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,059
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE NUMBERS,

400
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,696
WE GO FROM DOWN ABOUT 10% TO 15%

401
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:58,797
YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO UP ABOUT 10%

402
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,666
TO 15%.

403
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,834
YOU SHOULD SEE A DRAMATIC SWING

404
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,936
BACK IN TERMS OF THAT VERY TOUGH

405
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:04,837
IPHONE 6S CYCLE.

406
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:09,508
EMILY: WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY

407
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,943
ARE WORKING TOWARDS BUILDING OUT

408
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:11,777
THEIR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, BUT

409
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,813
YOU STILL REPORTED SOME NEW

410
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:15,614
HARDWARE ENHANCEMENTS COMING TO

411
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:16,048
THE IPAD.

412
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:16,615
TELL US ABOUT THAT.

413
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:20,619
>> THESE AREN'T LIKELY TO BE

414
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,021
SHOWN AT THIS EVENT ON SEPTEMBER

415
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:23,822
7, BUT APPLES WORKING I BUNCH OF

416
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:24,623
NEW MAC RELATED PRODUCTS AND NEW

417
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,326

418
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,193
STARTING WITH THE MAC, THEY ARE

419
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,362
WORKING ON THE SIGNIFICANT MAC

420
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,030
PRO UPDATE WE REPORTED ON

421
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,831
EARLIER THIS MONTH WITH A THIN

00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,733
DIGITAL SCREEN WITH THE BUTTONS

423
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,034
ON THE KEYBOARD THE CHANGE BASED

424
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:38,103
IN WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

425
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:38,871
THAT WILL BE A BIG UPDATE FOR

426
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:39,438
THE HIGH-TECH CROWD.

427
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,974
WE'RE ALSO HEARING FASTER MACBO

428
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:46,378
OK AIRS.

429
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,146
ALSO, APPLE IS COLLABORATING

430
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,215
WITH LG ELECTRONICS OUT OF SOUTH

431
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,251
KOREA ON A NEW MONITOR.

432
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,021
THIS MONITOR WOULD BE 5K, SEVEN

433
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,390
TIMES THE RESOLUTION IN THE SAME

434
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,191

436
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,698
SO, THOSE ARE GOING TO BE BIG

437
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:08,133
UPDATES ON THE MAC SIDE.

438
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,370
EMILY: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR

439
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,706
THE BOTTOM LINE?

440
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,540
IPAD SALES HAVE NOT BEEN GROWING

441
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,140
THE WAY THEY WERE.

442
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,611
MACBOOK SALES HAVE BEEN

443
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,379
HEALTHIER THAN MANY EXPECTED.

444
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:20,879
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

445
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,449
>> I THINK JUST DON'T OVERTHINK

446
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:24,783
IT.

447
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:25,551
THE BOTTOM LINE IS GOING TO

448
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,051
IMPROVE NICELY.

449
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:29,288
WE TALK ABOUT A 15% REVENUE

450
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,423
BOOST FROM NEXT TO NEXT YEAR,

451
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,224
AND EARNINGS SHOULD OUTPACE THAT

452
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:32,658
SLIGHTLY.

453
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,627
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS

454
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:36,395
STILL ALL ABOUT THE IPHONE AND

455
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,331
THESE OTHER PRODUCTS ARE

456
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:39,998
COLLECTIVELY 35% OF THE

457
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:41,400
BUSINESS.

458
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,435
IT'S ABOUT THE IPHONE, THE

459
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,269
IPHONE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD CYCLE,

460
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,371
AND IF WE WERE WRONG AND WE BLOW

461
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,439
IT ON THIS ONE, WE SHOULD CATCH

462
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,907
UP AND HAVE AN EVEN BETTER CYCLE

463
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,510

BE?

00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,260

PILOT, AND MAKE THE MONEY BACK

794
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,327
IT COSTS YOU TO BUY THAT DRONE

795
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,063
AND PROBABLY A NUMBER OF WEEKS.

796
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:19,897
THAT IS REALLY EXCITING FOR AN

797
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:20,331
INDUSTRY.

798
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,567
EMILY: IS THERE ANY AREA IN

799
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,969
WHICH YOU WISH THESE RULES WENT

800
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:25,770
FURTHER OR ANYTHING YOU DISLIKE

801
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,204
ABOUT THEM?

802
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,639
JAY: OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN

803
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:32,877
TALKING ABOUT THEIR NERVOUSNESS

804
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:33,978
AROUND A WAIVER PROCESS.

805
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:34,812
ALMOST EVERY PROVISION OF THIS

806
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:38,849
NEW RULE HAS A -- THE ABILITY TO

807
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:39,684
SUBMIT A WAIVER ONLINE THAT YOU

808
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,419
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO FLY,

809
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,720
FOR EXAMPLE, NEAR A CERTAIN

810
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,258
AIRPORTS, OR OTHER TYPES OF

811
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,025
CONDITIONS THAT ARE NORMALLY

812
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:48,726
PROHIBITED.

813
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,695
THEY ARE A BIT NERVOUS ABOUT HOW

814
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,029
THAT PROCESS IS GOING TO WORK

815
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:52,997
AND HOW MUCH TIME IT'S GOING TO

816
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:53,731
TAKE, BUT TIME WILL TELL.

817
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:57,735
EMILY: TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

818
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:58,536
RULES FOR HOBBYISTS, OR THE LACK

819
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,671
THEREOF.

820
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,708
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, IF YOU ARE I

821
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,475
WANT TO BUY A DRONE AND USE IT

822
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,309
FOR FUN, WE DON'T REALLY HAVE

823
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,711
ANY RULES TO FOLLOW.

824
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:12,116
ALAN: YES AND NO.

825
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:12,917
THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC RULES.

826
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,418
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW THE

827
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:17,755
SAFETY REQUIREMENTS OF A

828
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,724
COMMUNITY OR ORGANIZATION.

829
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,260
BASICALLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS,

830
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,762
VERY MUCH SIMILAR TO THIS

831
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:25,529
COMMERCIAL RULE, YOU ARE NOT

832
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:28,966
SUPPOSED TO FLY OVER PEOPLE, YOU

833
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:29,766
ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO TOO HIGH,

834
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:30,568
YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO NEAR

835
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:35,606
AIRPORTS, ETC.

836
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:36,440
THERE ARE CERTAINLY QUESTIONS

837
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,911
ABOUT HOW WELL THAT IS ENFORCED.

838
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,746
WE HAVE SEEN HUNDREDS OF REPORTS

839
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:43,547
OF DRONES FLYING NEAR PLANES AND

840
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:44,248
WHATNOT.

841
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,248
ESSENTIALLY, THE RULES ARE VERY

842
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:45,716
SIMILAR.

843
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:52,089
EMILY: I WAS SPEAKING TO THE

844
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:52,822
SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION,

845
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:54,759
ANTHONY FOXX, LAST WEEK, ABOUT

846
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,128
THIS VERY ISSUE AND THE FACT

847
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:57,862
THAT OUR RULES FOR HOBBYISTS

848
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,198
COULD POTENTIALLY GO FURTHER.

849
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:03,401
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHETHER

850
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,135
MORE REGULATION IS NEEDED IN

851
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:09,640
THAT AREA, OR WHAT?

852
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,508
JAY: WE THINK MORE EDUCATION IS

853
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:13,344
NEEDED.

854
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,879
REALLY IT'S ABOUT LETTING PEOPLE

855
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,280
KNOW WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT BE

856
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,215
DOING RATHER THAN ANY FORM OF

857
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,184
REGULATION AGAINST THEM, AND

858
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,419
THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING VERY

859
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:24,322
WELL.

860
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:28,159
REALLY MAKING SURE THERE IS

861
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,527
MATERIAL IN EVERY BOX TO LET

862
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,361
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD AND

863
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:30,928
SHOULD NOT BE DOING.

864
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,999
EMILY: TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT

865
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,334
SECRETARY FOX HAD TO SAY ABOUT

866
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,301
THESE NEW RULES AND WHAT SORT OF

867
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,403
INDUSTRY THEY COULD HELP OPEN UP

868
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:40,538
WHEN IT COMES TO DRONES.

869
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,105
TAKE A LISTEN.

870
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:45,609
>> IT WILL REALLY OPEN THE DOOR

871
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:46,577
TO MANY, MANY MORE COMMERCIAL

872
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:49,547
USES.

873
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:53,551
ON THE OTHER HAND, AS WE HAVE

874
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:57,555
COMMERCIAL USES, THE HOBBYISTS,

875
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,791
AIRPLANES, THE INTEGRATION OF

876
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,592
ALL THOSE DIFFERENT USES INTO A

877
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,561
SINGLE SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE THE

878
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:04,362
MOST COMPLICATED PART OF THIS.

879
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:08,366
EMILY: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

880
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,801
INDUSTRIES THAT THIS WILL AFFECT

881
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:11,235
MOST.

882
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,071
THERE IS BEEN A LOT OF TALK

883
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:14,638
ABOUT AGRICULTURE,

884
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:15,172
TRANSPORTATION.

885
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:19,643
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

886
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:20,478
ALAN: ON THE GROUND, IMAGING IS

887
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,780
THE NUMBER ONE VERTICAL.

888
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,582
THAT WOULD BE THINGS LIKE REAL

889
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:25,716
ESTATE PHOTOGRAPHY, EVENT

890
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,752
PHOTOGRAPHY, WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY

891
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:28,052
.

892
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,887
ANYBODY WHO'S A PHOTOGRAPHY IS

893
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:30,955
NOW BASICALLY A DRONE

894
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,857
PHOTOGRAPHER, AND PROBABLY WILL

895
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,759
BE GOING OUT TO GET A PART 107

896
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:38,262
LICENSE.

897
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,097
THE REMAINING LARGE AREAS ARE

898
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:40,898
INSPECTIONS, AND THAT COULD MEAN

899
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,334
ANYTHING FROM ROOF INSPECTIONS

900
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,168
TO SELL TOWER INSPECTIONS TO ANY

901
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,070
OTHER NUMBER OF THINGS PEOPLE

902
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,904
EXPECTED WITH HUMAN BEINGS THAT

903
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,272
ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND SAFELY

904
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:48,873
DONE WITH DRONES.

905
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,210
EMILY: WHAT ABOUT AMAZON?

906
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,412
HOW FAR OFF IS AN AMAZON DRONE,

907
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,146
DELIVERING MY PACKAGES TO MY

908
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,180
DOORSTEP?

909
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,485
>> AMAZON IS DOING MOST OF ITS

910
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,219
TESTING IN CAMBRIDGE AND THE

911
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:02,753
U.K. RIGHT NOW.

912
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,755
WE DON'T KNOW HOW FAR THEY HAVE

913
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:05,856
GOTTEN WITH IT.

914
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,391
FROM A REGULATORY POINT OF VIEW,

915
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,660
THERE ARE SOME STUMBLING BLOCKS

916
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,362
INSIDE DEPARTMENT 107 REGULATION

917
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,096
THAT THEY, GOOGLE AND OTHERS

918
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:16,234
WISH COULD HAVE GONE FURTHER.

919
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,003
WHICH IS REALLY HAVE TO SEE HOW

920
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:19,804
THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPS AND HOW

921
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:20,504
THE PROCESS DEVELOPS AROUND

922
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:21,038
THESE DELIVERIES.

923
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:25,443
EMILY: ALAN, AS THE PERSON

924
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,444
REPORTING ON THESE ISSUES, WHAT

925
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,646
DO YOU THINK IS THE NEXT

926
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:29,447
FRONTIER, THE NEXT STORY, THE

927
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,181
NEXT DEVELOPMENT WHEN IT COMES

928
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,383
TO DRONES AND DRONES REGULATION?

929
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:35,486
ALAN: IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE

930
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,555
SEEING A CRITICAL MASS HERE OF

931
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,390
CHANGE.

932
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,193
WE ARE GOING TO SEE BY THE END

933
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,027
OF THE YEAR RULES THAT WILL

934
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,562
ALLOW DRONES TO FLY DIRECTLY

935
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,029
OVER PEOPLE.

936
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,131
IT WILL BE RELATIVELY SIMPLE AT

937
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,600
FIRST, COVERING THE DRONE WITH

938

KEPT ITS DISTANCE FROM UBER.

00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,367

1072
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:18,388
INCREASINGLY.

1073

ERIC: THE IMPORTANT THING HERE,

1074
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,460
IT'S ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS.

1075
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,231
THERE ARE LOTS OF INVESTORS WITH

1093
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:01,198
UBER IS ALSO WORKING ON SELF

1094

DRIVING CARS.

1095
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,867
IT WILL BE THE FIRST TO GET A

1096
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,668
SELF DRIVING CAR ON THE ROAD IN

1097
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:05,669
PITTSBURGH.

1098
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,337
HOW DO YOU SEE THESE COMPANIES

1099
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:07,671
--

1100
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:10,440
ERIC: THE CEO OF ROBER HAS SAID

1101
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,945

TO UBER'S SUCCESS.

1104
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:23,320
SO, THAT IF ANYTHING PUTS THEM

1105
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,055
ON A COLLISION COURSE.

1106
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:25,722
I THINK THIS IS SORT OF

1107
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:26,490
INEVITABLE, THAT THERE WOULD BE

1108
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,159
A MORE PUBLIC VIEWING OF THE

1109
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:29,993

00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,763
EMILY: THERE ARE SOME PARALLELS

1112
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,933
HERE TO GOOGLE AND APPLE.

1113
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:39,970
ERIC SCHMIDT WAS ON APPLE'S

1115
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,372
EVENTUALLY RESIGNED.

1116
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,240
COULD WE SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT

1117
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:43,774
HAPPENING HERE?

1118
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,810
ERIC: IT'S VERY SIMILAR.

1119
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,979
THE FUNNY THING WITH ALL THESE

1120
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:49,813
RELATIONSHIPS IS, COMPANIES ARE

1121
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:50,414

THIS? 

1355
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,469
KENNETH: I HAVE BEEN CIRCLING

1356
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:40,803
IT.

1357
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:44,641
IT IS THE COPY I FIRST CAME

1358
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,143
ACROSS ON OUR KITCHEN TABLE AND

1359
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,412
I WAS ABOUT 10 OR 11 YEARS OLD,

1360
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,213
MY BROTHER WAS FIVE YEARS OLDER

1361
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:54,650
THAN ME, AND HE WAS DOING IT AT

1362
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:55,051
SCHOOL.

1363
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,754
I SAW THE THREE WYRD SISTERS ON

1364
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:00,056
THE COVER.

1365
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:00,857
THIS IS THE SAME COPY I HAVE

01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:04,260
DRESSING ROOM TABLE.

1368
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,663
40 YEARS OF THIS.

1369
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:10,700
CHARLIE: IS IT UNIQUE TO DO IT

1370
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,434
AT THIS TIME IN YOUR LIFE? 

1371
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,670
KENNETH: I THINK I HAD A GREAT

1372
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:17,573
OLD ACTING SCHOOL MENTOR WHO

1373
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:18,307
USED TO RUN THE ACADEMY OF

1374
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:21,177
DRAMATIC ART.

1375
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:21,978
HE SAID YOU HAVE GOT TO WAIT

1376
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,646
UNTIL YOU ARE THE RIGHT AGE,

1377
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:24,180
WHATEVER THAT IS.

1378
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,784
HE SAID YOU MIGHT 30'S AND 40'S,

1379
01:01:28,784 --> 01:01:29,952
YOU ARE TOO YOUNG.

1380
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:30,653
I DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT.

1381
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:32,355
I REVERED HIM.

1382
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,891
SOMEHOW IT CAME TOGETHER THROUGH

1383
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,660
VIRTUE, THROUGH MEETING ROB

1384
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,829
ASHFIELD, MY BRILLIANT

1385
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:40,930
CODIRECTOR AND FINDING THE RIGHT

1386
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:45,167
ELEMENTS, THE ACTRESS TO BE

1387
01:01:45,167 --> 01:01:46,936
LEADING MACBETH.

1388
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:47,670
THE ELEMENTS STARTED TO PULL

1389
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:48,104
TOGETHER.

1390
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:51,374
CHARLIE: YOU HAD A 10 YEAR

1391
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,108
ABSENCE FROM SHAKESPEARE.

1392
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:55,144
KENNETH: I HAD, AND LIKE MANY

1393
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:58,080
THINGS IN MY CAREER, OTHERS MAY

1394
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,248
LOOK AT IT DIFFERENTLY.

1395
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:05,621
THESE ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.

1396
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:06,322
MY WIFE TALKS ABOUT IT.

1397
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:09,358
SHE SAYS PEOPLE SAY TO ME, DOES

1398
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:10,560
HE READ SHAKESPEARE BY THE

1399
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,496
BEDSIDE? 

1400
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:16,699
I SAID, WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM? 

1401
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,401
SHE SAID, YES, YOU DO, BECAUSE

1402
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,536
YOU ALWAYS ARE.

1403
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:23,973
SO I TOOK 10 YEARS AWAY FROM

1404
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:24,740
DOING IT, BUT QUITE A LOT OF

1405
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,075
TIME JUST READING OR BEING

1406
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:26,542
EXPOSED.

1407
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:27,209
IT IS ALWAYS IN MY LIFE.

1408
01:02:27,209 --> 01:02:30,646
CHARLIE: WHAT IS THIS DIFFERENT?

1409
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,716
KENNETH: I SUPPOSE EVERY TIME A

1410
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:36,385
GROUP OF PARTICULAR PEOPLE DO IT

1411
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:37,553
, THERE IS A CERTAIN ELEMENTAL

1412
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:41,624
PART OF THE PEACE, SO MAYBE THE

1413
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:43,993
FIRST THING WE DO IS TO TAKE A

1414
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:44,861
SPEECH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

1415
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,997
PLAY, SPOKEN BY A CHARACTER

1416
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:48,731
CALLED THE BLOODY SERGEANT,

1417
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,067
WHICH IS THE DESCRIPTION OF A

1418
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:52,702
BATTLE IN WHICH MACBETH IS

1419
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:56,806
EXTREMELY BRAVE AND HEROIC,

1420
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,274
FEARLESS IN FACT.

1421
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,141
INTERESTING FOR A CHARACTER WHO

1422
01:02:59,141 --> 01:03:00,109
WILL BECOME FEARFUL FOR THE REST

1423
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,644
OF THE PLAY.

1424
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:05,114
WE DARED TAKE THAT AWAY AND PUT

1425
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:08,551
WHAT HE DESCRIBES ON STAGE.

1426
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:09,385
AND WE WANTED TO DO THAT FOR A

1427
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,386
COUPLE OF REASONS.

1428
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,088
FIRST HE SAID, WHEN YOU MEET

1429
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:14,156
MACBETH, YOU KNOW A LITTLE OF

1430
01:03:14,156 --> 01:03:14,924
WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN OF THIS

1431
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,093
YEAR LISTEN, SAVAGERY.

1432
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:21,631
A MAN WHO YOU IMAGINE IN FIRST

1433
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,365
PLACE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE

1434
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,132
PROBLEMS THAT HE TURNS OUT TO

1435
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,334
HAVE LATER ON WHEN FOCUSED WITH

1436
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:25,901
ANOTHER MURDER.

1437
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:29,171
IN BATTLE, HE SEEMS FEARLESS.

1438
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:32,341
WHAT WE WANTED TO CHIEFLY DO WAS

1439
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:33,075
INTRODUCED TO THE AUDIENCE A

1440
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:34,143
THEATRICAL ENERGY WHICH WAS

1441
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,046
HECTIC AND HURTLING, WHERE THEY

1442
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:39,215
CAN LITERALLY BE A PART OF THE

1443
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,183
HECTIC NATURE BETWEEN THE

1444
01:03:41,183 --> 01:03:44,120
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THESE TWO

1445
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:44,920
FUNDAMENTALLY, AT THE BEGINNING

1446
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,256
OF THE PLAY, GOOD PEOPLE WHO

1447
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,024
MAKE BAD DECISIONS BECAUSE THE

1448
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:50,026
PLAY, CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PLOT

1449
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:50,860
DOES NOT GIVE YOU TIME TO THINK.

1450
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,397
CHARLIE: THE NEW YORK TIMES

1451
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,599
LOVED THE PLAY.

1452
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,935
THEY CAPTURED THAT VERY THING,

1453
01:03:58,935 --> 01:03:59,402
HURTLING.

1454
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:00,136
FROM THE BEGINNING, YOU HAVE

1455
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:00,736
THAT KIND OF ENERGY.

1456
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:05,875
KENNETH: THEY WERE ALSO

1457
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:06,642
INTERESTED IN WHAT GOES IN THE

1458
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:09,478
CARDINAL SIN POWER, AND WHY AND

1459
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:10,246
HOW THESE TWO PEOPLE COULD DO

1460
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:14,550
THIS EXTRAORDINARY THING.

1461
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,719
ONE THINKS ABOUT IN PLAYS, IT IS

1462
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:17,453
EASY TO THINK ABOUT IT IN

1463
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:18,587
MELODRAMATIC TERMS, BUT THIS MAN

1464
01:04:18,587 --> 01:04:20,523
KILLED A FRIEND OF HIS, WHO IS

1465
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,793
KING, WHATEVER, AND HE DOESN'T

1466
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,428
VERY SWIFTLY AND WITHOUT OTHERS

1467
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:30,066
BEING CONSCIOUS.

1468
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:30,866
SO OTHERS DISMISS IT AS IT IS

1469
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:35,238
ABSURD, IT HAPPENS TOO QUICKLY.

1470
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:36,105
OUR PRODUCTION WAS TRYING TO SAY

1471
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,406
PERHAPS THESE THINGS ONLY HAPPEN

1472
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:38,774
QUICKLY WITHOUT THOUGHT.

1473
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:41,811
CHARLIE: AND ABOUT HIS WIFE? 

1474
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:45,948
KENNETH: SHE, I CAN'T DESCRIBE

1475
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:50,886
HER AS NOT WITHOUT AMBITION BUT

1476
01:04:50,886 --> 01:04:51,720
A SICKNESS, TOO FULL OF THE MILK

1477
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,990
OF HUMAN KINDNESS.

1478
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,958
THERE ARE REMARKS OF HER BEING

1479
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:56,725
ESSENTIALLY GOOD-NATURED, BUT

1480
01:04:56,725 --> 01:04:59,962
ONCE HE HAS HAD THIS AMAZING

1481
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:00,696
SUCCESS, REVIEWS ARE BRILLIANT

1482
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:01,997
AS IT WERE THAT DUNCAN SAYS

1483
01:05:01,997 --> 01:05:03,065
FANTASTIC, I AM GOING TO GIVE

1484
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:07,103
YOU, I AM PLANTING YOU, YOU WILL

1485
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:07,803
HAVE ALL SORTS OF REWARDS.

1486
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:09,672
CHARLIE: A NEW NAME.

1487
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:14,009
KENNETH: A NEW NAME EVEN, BUT I

1488
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:15,878
AM GIVING MY JOB TO HIM, INSTEAD

1489
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:16,312
OF MY SON.

1490
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:18,681
AND IMMEDIATELY MAC BETH,

1491
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,749
CERTAINLY WITH THE WITCHES IN

1492
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:24,987
HIS PRONOUNCEMENT, A FEW SHORT

1493
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:25,821
MOMENTS AGO, SAY, WHY SHOULD HE

1494
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:28,157
BE IN THE WAY? 

1495
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:32,361
I WILL HAVE TO TAKE THIS STEP

1496
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:34,029
THAT LAYS IN MY WAY, WHICH I

1497
01:05:34,029 --> 01:05:35,764
MUST FALL DOWN OR ELSE OR LEAP.

1498
01:05:35,764 --> 01:05:40,336
OR LEAP, OR LEAP MEANS MURDER IN

1499
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:44,206
THIS CONTEXT.

1500
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:46,342
IT IS BASICALLY A WONDERFUL PLAY

1501
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:47,076
FOR PUTTING PEOPLE IN THIS

1502
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,244
UNUSUAL, EXTREME POSITION.

1503
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:51,347
CHARLIE: THE WITCHES ARE GREAT.

1504
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:52,148
YOU SEE THE OPENING WITH THIS

1505
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:55,217
DON'T HAND KIND OF THING.

1506
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,520
-- YOU SEE THE OPENING WITH THIS

1507
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,322
STONEHENGE KIND OF THING.

1508
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:03,526
KENNETH: IN THE LIVES OF THE

1509
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:05,427
GOOD AND THE GREAT, THE POWER OF

1510
01:06:05,427 --> 01:06:07,396
SUGGESTION.

1511
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,732
SOME WOULD SAY IT IS A SILLY

1512
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:10,499
PLAY BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT A MAN

1513
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:11,467
WHO BELIEVES HIS RISK UP.

1514
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,469
THERE -- HIS HOROSCOPE.

1515
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,438
CHARLIE: WOMEN OF POWER BELIEVE

1516
01:06:16,438 --> 01:06:17,473
IN MYTH AS WELL.

1517
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:21,844
KENNETH: AND ALSO, A PLACE IN

1518
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:22,645
HISTORY AND THIS IDEA OF WHAT

1519
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:26,081
THE LEGACY IS.

1520
01:06:26,081 --> 01:06:27,383
MACBETH AND LADY MACBETH APPEAR

1521
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:30,219
TO NOT HAVE CHILDREN, SO

1522
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:32,555
IMMORTALITY IS NOT GUARANTEED BY

1523
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:32,955
FAMILY.

1524
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:33,689
SO NOW IMMORTALITY CAN PERHAPS

1525
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,758
BE SEIZED BY HAVING A NAME IN

1526
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:36,358
THE HISTORY BOOKS.

1527
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:40,796
CHARLIE: THE RELATIONSHIP

1528
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:41,630
BETWEEN THE TWO, IS SHE MORE MET

1529
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:42,231
AMBITIOUS THAN HE IS? 

1530
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:45,901
KENNETH: I THINK SHE IS EQUALLY

1531
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:46,368
AMBITIOUS.

1532
01:06:46,368 --> 01:06:47,436
ONE OF THE THINGS WE TRIED TO

1533
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:50,840
BRING IN WITH THIS SAVAGERY, SHE

1534
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,975
SAYS GOODBYE AND HE GOES OFF TO

1535
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:53,776
BATTLE, THE IDEA OF WHETHER HE

1536
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:55,377
COMES HOME OR NOT IS REALLY VERY

1537
01:06:55,377 --> 01:06:57,880
HEAVILY QUESTIONED.

1538
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,814
WHEN THEY DO COME BACK, WE DO

1539
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:02,051
PRESENT, WE WANTED TO PRESENT

1540
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:03,119
THIS FUNCTIONING RELATIONSHIP.

1541
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,187
THEY SCARE THE PANTS OFF OF EACH

1542
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:05,621
OTHER.

1543
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:06,155
VERY PASSIONATE.

1544
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:07,890
CHARLIE: THE PASSION COMES OUT.

1545
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:10,859
KENNETH: IAN MCKELLEN WOULD

1546
01:07:10,859 --> 01:07:12,995
ARGUE THERE ARE NO SUCCESSFUL

1547
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,897
MARRIAGES IN SHAKESPEARE EXCEPT

1548
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:20,269
TO THE MCBETHS, WHICH THEY BOTH

1549
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:21,036
DIE AND THEY BOTH KILL A KING

1550
01:07:21,036 --> 01:07:21,503
ALONG THE WAY.

1551
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:26,775
I FIRST THOUGHT THE CONVERSATION

1552
01:07:26,775 --> 01:07:27,610
THAT WAS ESSENTIAL TO THE SHOW,

1553
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:28,377
TO THE PERFORMANCE IS THAT HE

1554
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,078
ADORES HER.

1555
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:32,148
SHE IS A NATURAL COMPANION FOR

1556
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:34,917
HIM, AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW,

1557
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:35,884
THE BREAKUP -- 

1558
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:38,354
CHARLIE: IS SHE STRONGER OR

1559
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:38,821
WEAKER? 

1560
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:42,391
KENNETH: I CAN'T -- THEY BOTH AT

1561
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,660
DIFFERENT TIMES INVOKE THE DARK

1562
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,094
WORLD.

1563
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:46,362
SHE IS THE FIRST ONE TO SAY

1564
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:47,997
RIGHT, I AM INVITING EVIL INTO

1565
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:52,001
THE ROOM.

1566
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:52,768
WE ARE IN A WORLD WHERE WE

1567
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:53,302
BELIEVE IN IT.

1568
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,370
YOU AUDIENCE HAVE JUST ENOUGH

1569
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,237
BECAUSE THEY WERE HANGING AROUND

1570
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,572
THE STONES AND THEY WERE SCARY,

1571
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,440
INVITING THEM IN.

1572
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,208
SHE HAS TO DO IT IN THE FIRST

1573
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:01,544
TIME IN AN FIRST TIME OUT.

1574
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:05,281
HE, THE BALANCE OF PULITZER --

1575
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:07,550
OF POWER SWITCHES.

1576
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,585
AND THEN WITH THIS MAIL-FEMALE

1577
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,820
POINT OF VIEW, HE SAYS LET'S NOT

1578
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:12,655
DO IT TONIGHT, SHE SAYS YOU HAVE

1579
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:15,624
GOT TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY.

1580
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:16,591
THEN HE BECOMES PRESIDENT AND

1581
01:08:16,591 --> 01:08:19,761
SAYS LEAVE EVERYTHING ALONE, BUT

1582
01:08:19,761 --> 01:08:20,595
HE WILL SWEAR OFF -- 

1583
01:08:20,595 --> 01:08:23,765
CHARLIE: AND THE PROPHECY FROM

1584
01:08:23,765 --> 01:08:24,600
THE WITCHES.

1585
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,569
WHAT THEY SAID, THEREFORE HE

1586
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:28,636
WENT OFF KILLING ANYBODY.

1587
01:08:28,636 --> 01:08:31,841
KENNETH: HE SPENDS ELITE TRYING

1588
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:32,575
TO SWEAR THE CIRCLE.

1589
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:36,879
-- ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO SWEAR

1590
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:38,180
THE CIRCLE.

1591
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,014
INSTEAD OF BEING THE FATHER OF

1592
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:41,884
KINGS, HE TRIES TO BUILD BOTH

1593
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:42,451
HIM AND HIS SON.

1594
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:43,551
HIS DETERMINATION TO LEAVE NO

1595
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:45,988
STONE UNTURNED MEANS HE WON'T

1596
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:47,857
EVER SLEEP AGAIN.

1597
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:49,825
AND THERE IS NO SATISFACTION.

1598
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:50,993
AND THE FIRST MOMENT WE SEE HIM

1599
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:53,862
ASKING, HE IS WITH HER, AND THEY

1600
01:08:53,862 --> 01:08:57,633
CELEBRATE.

1601
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:58,533
THE PRODUCTION HOUSE WALKS ON AT

1602
01:08:58,533 --> 01:08:59,068
THE CORONATION.

1603
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:04,140
HE SAYS, TO BE THUS IS NOTHING.

1604
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:08,444
TO BE SAFELY THUS.

1605
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:10,279
I AM HERE, I GOT A CROWN, AND IS

1606
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:11,147
NOTHING.

1607
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,816
CHARLIE: SAFELY.

1608
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:17,019
KENNETH: TO BE SAFELY, AND THEN

1609
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:19,121
HE SPLURGES IN PARANOIA.

1610
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,256
CHARLIE: YOU THOUGHT ABOUT DOING

1611
01:09:21,256 --> 01:09:24,859
IT IN THE 20TH -- WAY IN THE

1612
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:27,162
FUTURE, A VERY FUTURISTIC KIND.

1613
01:09:27,162 --> 01:09:27,962
WHAT DREW YOU AWAY FROM THAT TO

1614
01:09:27,962 --> 01:09:28,497
WHERE YOU ARE? 

1615
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:32,401
KENNETH: THIS DIFFICULT THING OF

1616
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:33,234
WHEN YOU COME UP WITH A SORT OF,

1617
01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:35,604
WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A SORT OF

1618
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:36,372
CONCEPT FOR THE WORLD OF THE

1619
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:38,540
PLAY, AND ALL OF THESE PLAYS ARE

1620
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,676
VERY ELASTIC SO THEY CAN ADAPT.

1621
01:09:41,676 --> 01:09:42,544
SHAKESPEARE CAN SURVIVE ANYTHING

1622
01:09:42,544 --> 01:09:44,979
WE STRUCK HIM UP WITH.

1623
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:48,216
BUT MANY TIMES, THE IDEA HAS TO

1624
01:09:48,216 --> 01:09:52,421
DO WITH PRODUCTIVE QUALITY.

1625
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:58,127
YOU MIGHT GET, YOU SET THE

1626
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,062
MERCHANT OF VENICE IN THE NEW

1627
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:00,829
YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, AND YOU GET

1628
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:01,597
A RESONANCE WITH THE WORLD OF

1629
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:05,467
MONEY, BUT IS ALSO ABOUT LOVE,

1630
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:06,268
WHETHER THE GIRL IS GOING TO

1631
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:07,002
CHOOSE THE BOY OR WHATEVER IT

1632
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:07,469
MIGHT BE.

1633
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:11,673
SO THE FUTURISTIC MCBETH FELT AS

1634
01:10:11,673 --> 01:10:15,344
THOUGH IT POTENTIALLY DENIED THE

1635
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:20,449
SAVAGERY AND PRIMITIVE NATURE OF

1636
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:20,983
SOME OF THESE.

1637
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,718
AND MALCOLM LATER ON SAYS WE

1638
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:23,619
WILL MAKE THOSE WHO HELPED ME

1639
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:29,091
HERE EARLS, THE FIRST THAT

1640
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:29,658
SCOTLAND EVER HAS.

1641
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:32,995
YOU SENSE THE JOURNEY FROM

1642
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:33,796
PRIMITIVE TO MORE SENSIBLE WHERE

1643
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,030
PEOPLE IN POWER WILL GIVE YOU AN

1644
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:35,998
HONOR.

1645
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:40,469
CHARLIE: IT IS FASCINATING ABOUT

1646
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:41,003
SHAKESPEARE.

1647
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:42,037
FIRST OF ALL, I THINK I READ

1648
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:49,678
THAT JAMES V, WHO BECAME JAMES I

1649
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:51,947
OF ENGLAND, WOULD COME TO

1650
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:52,481
SHAKESPEARE PLAYS.

1651
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,316
KENNETH: HE WAS OBSESSED WITH

1652
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:55,150
THE SUBJECT.

1653
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:59,354
CHARLIE: THE STORY OF MACBETH,

1654
01:10:59,354 --> 01:11:00,389
THEY THINK HE GOT FROM THE

1655
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:01,123
CHRONICLES? 

1656
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:03,892
KENNETH: YES, SURE.

1657
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:08,063
SHAKESPEARE WAS FANTASTICALLY

1658
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:10,032
COMPREHENSIVE IN WHERE HE WENT

1659
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:10,732
FOR ALL OF HIS STORIES.

1660
01:11:10,732 --> 01:11:15,103
AND ALSO, HE KNEW HOW TO BORROW,

1661
01:11:15,103 --> 01:11:17,206
AND HE KNEW HOW TO BE INSPIRED.

1662
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:21,410
WE DID RECENTLY, ALEX AND I, THE

1663
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:21,877
RADIANT.

1664
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:28,517
A FAMOUS SPEECH ABOUT THE PART

1665
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:29,251
SHE SAT ON LIKE A BURNISHED

1666
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:29,618
THRONE.

1667
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,221
CHARLIE: THERE IS A COMPARISON

1668
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:33,489
BETWEEN THE TWO.

1669
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:36,558
KENNETH: THE ESSENTIAL FOCUS ON

1670
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:40,562
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TO COME

1671
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:41,363
LOCATED PEOPLE, A POWERFUL MAN

1672
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:44,533
WITH A BRILLIANT WOMAN, AND THEY

1673
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:45,200
HAVE A BALANCING IMPACT.

1674
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,671
BUT THE BARD SPEECH IN THOMAS

1675
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:52,541
NORTH'S LIVES OF THE ANCIENT

1676
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:56,812
ROMANS, ETC., SHAKESPEARE

1677
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:57,479
COULTERS FAIRLY COME

1678
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:58,814
INTENSIVELY.

1679
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,784
HE SCATTERED HIS GATHERINGS, BUT

1680
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:02,184
-- 

1681
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:04,787
CHARLIE: EVERY WRITER STEALS A

1682
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:05,688
GREAT DEAL.

1683
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:08,724
KENNETH: YEAH, YEAH.

1684
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,726
CHARLIE: THE RESULTS OF THIS IN

1685
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:14,730
TERMS OF, WHEN YOU, THERE ARE

1686
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,565
THESE SOLILOQUIES YOU HAVE WITH

1687
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:19,735
LINES, TOMORROW AND TOMORROW AND

1688
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:20,903
TOMORROW, DID YOU APPROACH THOSE

1689
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,471
DIFFERENTLY? 

1690
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,873
THAT YOU WANTED TO, IN YOUR OWN

1691
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:28,911
RENDITION NOT TO BE DIFFERENT

1692
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:30,212
FROM ANYONE ELSE WHO HAD BEEN

1693
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:31,079
MACBETH, BUT SOME SENSE OF HOW

1694
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:32,881
YOU WANTED TO TAKE THESE

1695
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:33,749
DIFFERENT MOMENTS? 

1696
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:35,584
AND DELIVER THEM? 

1697
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:38,787
KENNETH: IT IS A QUESTION, FOR

1698
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:40,923
INSTANCE WITH TOMORROW AND

1699
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:44,793
TOMORROW AND TOMORROW, IT GREW

1700
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:45,627
ORGANICALLY OUT OF THIS IDEA

1701
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:48,097
THAT ASIDE FROM THE SORT OF FAST

1702
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:51,867
AND EXISTENTIAL HOWL AS YOU MAY

1703
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:55,971
EXPECT IT TO BE, IT IS ALSO --

1704
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:57,106
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SPEECH

1705
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,374
-- A SPEECH OF MOURNING FOR HIS

1706
01:12:59,374 --> 01:13:01,577
WIFE.

1707
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:02,411
IN OUR PRODUCTION, THAT IS SO

1708
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:05,280
UNDERLINED THE PASSION BETWEEN

1709
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,351
THEM, THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN

1710
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:11,387
PAINFUL, PERSONAL LOSS OF A

1711
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:15,424
WOMAN THAT HE ADORED THROUGH HIS

1712
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:18,193
OWN STRUTTING AND FRETTING AND

1713
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:22,531
IDIOCY, IF YOU LIKE, INFORMS THE

1714
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:23,098
WAY THAT CAME OUT.

1715
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:23,799
IT BECAME VERY PERSONAL.

1716
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:28,036
WE WANTED TO TAKE AWAY -- WHAT I

1717
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:28,870
HAVE SEEN SOMETIMES IN VERSIONS

1718
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:29,605
OF THE PLAY WHICH IS PERFECTLY

1719
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:30,339
FINE BUT NOT TO MY TASTE, THAT

1720
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,741
IT BE TO DRY, TOO INTELLECTUALLY

1721
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:33,208
EXTREME.

1722
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,577
CHARLIE: YOU DID NOT WANT THAT.

1723
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:37,713
KENNETH: I DID NOT WANT IT TO BE

1724
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,748
DRY.

1725
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:42,217
VISCERAL, PASSIONATE, AS MUCH

1726
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:43,619
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE

1727
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:46,588
PLAY AS THERE IS LESS OPTICAL

1728
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:47,089
INTELLIGENCE.

1729
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:47,856
IT CAN GET VERY DRY BECAUSE THE

1730
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:50,659
POETRY IS OUT DENSE, SO

1731
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:52,427
BRILLIANT, SO COMPLEX.

1732
01:13:52,427 --> 01:13:54,463
THE DOUBLE UP WITH SHAKESPEARE

1733
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:55,464
IS THAT IF YOU CONNECT ALL OF

1734
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:58,767
THAT BRILLIANCE, ALL OF THAT

1735
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,702
INTELLECTUAL FIREPOWER AT THIS

1736
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:02,604
INCREDIBLE LEVEL WITH THIS SENSE

1737
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,405
THAT YOU ARE WATCHING REAL LIVE

1738
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,874
HUMAN BEINGS, AND THERE BEFORE

1739
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:08,944
THE GRADE -- THE GRACE OF GOD GO

1740
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:09,411
ALL OF US.

1741
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:11,847
CHARLIE: DEALING WITH LIFE AND

1742
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:12,514
DEATH AND HORROR.

1743
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:14,683
KENNETH: YEAH, SURE.

1744
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:17,886
CHARLIE: OR RAGE AND GUILT.

1745
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:21,123
KENNETH: PEOPLE, MY GOODNESS ME,

1746
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:25,327
YOU CAN FEEL THE ATMOSPHERE IN

1747
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:25,827
THE AUDIENCE.

1748
01:14:25,827 --> 01:14:26,495
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE

1749
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:27,195
BEGINNING OF THE PLAY AND

1750
01:14:27,195 --> 01:14:29,865
PERHAPS WITH THE AUDIENCE,

1751
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:30,632
BACKING AWAY FROM THIS WITH

1752
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:31,967
THEIR FINGERS THROBBING, THEY

1753
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:35,204
HAVE DONE IT.

1754
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:40,942
KING DUNCAN, I KILLED ONE OF OUR

1755
01:14:40,942 --> 01:14:41,343
FRIENDS.

1756
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:45,981
NOW WHAT DO WE DO THEY BECOME

1757
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:46,615
LIKE CHILDREN ALMOST.

1758
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:51,586
IN THAT MOMENT PEOPLE MAY NOT

1759
01:14:51,586 --> 01:14:52,387
KILL A KING, BUT THEY ARE GOING

1760
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:53,155
TO DO THINGS FOR WHICH THEY CAN

1761
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:58,493
NEVER RECOVER.

1762
01:14:58,493 --> 01:14:59,227
IN ONE NANOSECOND, LIFE WILL

1763
01:14:59,227 --> 01:14:59,961
NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN.

1764
01:14:59,961 --> 01:15:00,729
YOU FEEL ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE GO,

1765
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,898
OH MY GOD.

1766
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:03,465
THAT COULD BE ME.

1767
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:07,402
CHARLIE: EITHER THE CHOICE YOU

1768
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:08,203
MADE OR THINGS THRUST UPON YOU.

1769
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:11,773
KENNETH: IT IS TERRIBLY MOVING.

1770
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:12,607
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN

1771
01:15:12,607 --> 01:15:13,575
THRILLED WITH IS PEOPLE FIND

1772
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:14,109
THIS MOVING.

1773
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:16,111
WHY SHOULD YOU FEEL MOVED OR

1774
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:16,945
EVEN SOME PATHETIC TO CHARACTERS

1775
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:20,115
WHO PERFORM SUCH HEINOUS ACTS,

1776
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:20,916
BUT SOMEHOW SHAKESPEARE'S

1777
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:21,383
MASTERY -- 

1778
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:23,385
CHARLIE: GENIUS.

1779
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:26,288
KENNETH: BY THE END WHEN HE

1780
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,323
LOSES HER AND CONVEY EITHER IN

1781
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:32,628
LADY MACBETH SORT OF SCENT INTO

1782
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:35,297
WHAT MAY APPEAR TO BE MADNESS,

1783
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:37,065
OR WHAT YOU ALREADY SENSE WITH

1784
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:38,667
MAC BETH AT THE END, SORT OF A

1785
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:41,570
GRAND THING TO SAY, BUT THE

1786
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:45,741
BLEAKNESS IN HIS SOUL IS SO

1787
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:46,542
PROFOUND, IT IS CHILLING.

1788
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:51,914
THE GLIMPSE OF A KIND OF DARK

1789
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:53,615
ETERNITY THAT HE SHOWS US IS SO

1790
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,650
TERRIFYING THAT YOU CAN'T HELP

1791
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:58,520
BUT BE MOVED BECAUSE THE PRICE

1792
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,322
HE HAS PAID FOR THIS MOMENT OF

1793
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:04,326
RECKLESS AMBITION IS SO DEEP AND

1794
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:08,830
PROFOUND AS TO SHAKE ONE TO THE

1795
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:09,498
VERY CORE ON HIS BEHALF.

1796
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:10,766
CHARLIE: AND LEAD TO HIS DEATH.

1797
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:13,368
KENNETH: YEAH.

1798
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:14,836
ISN'T IT STRANGE? 

1799
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:19,374
IN THE END HE IS -- HE IS

1800
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:20,175
FEARLESS AND BATTLE IN THE

1801
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:20,609
BEGINNING.

1802
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:22,644
THROUGH THE POWER OF SUGGESTION,

1803
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:25,881
HE IS FEARFUL AND GUILT LADEN,

1804
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:31,920
DREAM AND -- WHAT THE

1805
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,789
SHAKESPEARE SEEM TO ADMIRE IN

1806
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:37,025
HIS SOLDIER POETS, BOTH FELLOW,

1807
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:37,526
MACBETH? 

1808
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:43,765
IT IS BLOOD AND GUTS.

1809
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:44,566
HE IS RIGHT THERE IN THE END.

1810
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:46,001
I AM GOING TO KISS THE GROUND

1811
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:49,037
BEFORE MALCOLM'S FEET.

1812
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,739
HE HAS THE FOREST MOVED IT, YOU

1813
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:51,740
WEREN'T BORN OF WOMAN AND A BEAR

1814
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:52,607
AGAINST ME.

1815
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,876
YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1816
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:56,144
COME AND GET IT.

1817
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:58,980
I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT.

1818
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,916
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT? 

1819
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,352
SHOW ME SOMETHING.

1820
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:06,588
HE JUST HANGS IN THERE.

1821
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:07,355
SOMEHOW THERE IS A PROFOUND

1822
01:17:07,355 --> 01:17:09,991
RESPECT FOR THIS MAN.

1823
01:17:09,991 --> 01:17:10,592
I NEVER RAN AWAY.

1824
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:13,895
AND HE TALKS TO HER, AND

1825
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:16,765
COMPLIMENT THEM BOTH, TWO WORDS,

1826
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:17,933
TWO TIMES USES THE WORD

1827
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:18,400
DAUNTLESS.

1828
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,170
AND SHAKESPEARE ADMIRES, AND I

1829
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:25,373
DO, PEOPLE WHO TAKE WHATEVER

1830
01:17:25,373 --> 01:17:27,375
LIFE THROWS AT THEM, ONE FOOT IN

1831
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:29,311
FRONT OF THE OTHER.

1832
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:32,247
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO? 

1833
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:33,281
SHAKESPEARE OFTEN SAYS THAT.

1834
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:35,651
YOU WANT TO FEEL GRANDER, BUT

1835
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:36,518
SOMETIMES THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE

1836
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:37,085
TO DO IS SHOW UP.

1837
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:41,089
CHARLIE: IN YOUR OWN PANTHEON,

1838
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,390
IS THERE 1, 2, 3 AMONG

1839
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:43,091
SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS? 

1840
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:47,596
KENNETH: GOSH, WHAT A QUESTION.

1841
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:50,198
YOUR LIFE CHANGES, YOU HAVE OR

1842
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:50,899
EXPERIENCE, YOU REACTED

1843
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:52,501
DIFFERENTLY TO THESE THINGS.

1844
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:57,305
YOU HAVE HAD MILLIE BRILLIANT

1845
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:57,973
CAP -- MANY BRILLIANT

1846
01:17:57,973 --> 01:18:00,542
CONVERSATIONS WITH HAROLD BLOOM.

1847
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:04,279
AND THE POLISH SCHOLAR, FAMOUS

1848
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:06,748
FROM THE 1960'S, WE CALLED HIM

1849
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,450
OUR CONTEMPORARY.

1850
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:12,020
AND HAMLET SUMS UP THE PROCESS

1851
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:12,821
OF LIVING, THAT APPLIES ACROSS

1852
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:13,488
MANY OF THESE PLAYS.

1853
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:16,191
RIGHT NOW ONE'S SOUL IS SHAKEN

1854
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:20,562
WITH WHAT MACBETH DOES TO THE

1855
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:20,996
AUDIENCE.

1856
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:21,463
WE ARE THERE.

1857
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:22,264
WE ARE THE LUCKY VESSELS OR

1858
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,399
WHICH THIS RING PASSES CURRENTLY

1859
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:28,536
IN THIS -- THIS THING PASSES

1860
01:18:28,536 --> 01:18:29,170
CURRENTLY IN THIS SHOW.

1861
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:31,740
CHARLIE: FIVE MINUTES BEFORE YOU

1862
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,576
GO ON, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,

1863
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:35,509
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO YOURSELF?

1864
01:18:35,643 --> 01:18:36,611
KENNETH: I AM MEDITATING.

1865
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:38,647
CHARLIE: CLEARING YOUR MIND.

1866
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:42,851
KENNETH: MY FAVORITE QUOTE FROM

1867
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:45,921
SHAKESPEARE, FROM HAMLET IS "THE

1868
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,956
READINESS IS ALL." 

1869
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:50,125
THAT IS ALL I DO.

1870
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:50,992
PEOPLE SAY YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL

1871
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:52,360
TIME IN NEW YORK? 

1872
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,963
OH, YES, BUT PARTLY BECAUSE I AM

1873
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:58,934
AT THE THEATER MANY HOURS BEFORE

1874
01:18:58,934 --> 01:18:59,734
ANY SANE HUMAN BEING WOULD BE.

1875
01:18:59,734 --> 01:19:02,938
I READ THE LINES EVERY DAY, DO

1876
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:06,808
THE WHOLE PLAY IN VARYING WAYS,

1877
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:07,676
TRICK YOURSELF TO KEEP IT FRESH.

1878
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:10,979
FIVE MINUTES BEFORE YOU GO ON,

1879
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:11,413
MEDITATE.

1880
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,213
AND THE OTHER THING, I SWEAR TO

1881
01:19:12,213 --> 01:19:14,082
GOD I THINK THIS IS JUST THE

1882
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:16,217
MOST FANTASTIC THING THAT WE

1883
01:19:16,217 --> 01:19:19,387
HAVE TO DO.

1884
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:20,188
IT IS REALLY TINGLING, NOT AN

1885
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:23,858
EASY THING TO DO GIVEN ONE IS

1886
01:19:23,858 --> 01:19:26,594
AWARE OF THE SORT OF EFFORT IN

1887
01:19:26,594 --> 01:19:28,563
TERMS OF WHAT WE DO, BUT IT IS

1888
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:31,132
ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS, GLORIOUS

1889
01:19:31,132 --> 01:19:31,633
THING TO DO.

1890
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:34,703
I SOMETIMES FEEL -- I'M A BIG

1891
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:37,038
FAN OF SPORTS GENERALLY.

1892
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:37,772
IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE IN THE

1893
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:39,841
TUNNEL WAITING TO COME OUT

1894
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:40,408
BEFORE HUGE GAME.

1895
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:43,044
IT IS LIKE TOURNAMENT TENNIS OR

1896
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:43,478
SOMETHING.

1897
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:45,780
SOME OF IT IS UP HERE, SOME OF

1898
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,248
IT IS IN THE BODY.

1899
01:19:47,248 --> 01:19:48,083
IN OUR CASE WE START WITH A FIVE

1900
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:48,550
MINUTE BATTLE.

1901
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:51,319
THEN YOU ARE -- OH IT REVS YOU

1902
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:54,790
UP.

1903
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,423
WE FIGHT EVERY DAY.

1904
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,258
IT IS RAINING, WE ARE IN THE

1905
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:58,293
DARK AND 25 ENORMOUS FELLOWS

1906

1907
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:03,198
CHARLIE: YOU HAVE GOT TO BE

1908
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:03,932
ATHLETIC, TOO.

1909

.

1910
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,370
KENNETH: IT IS MORE ABOUT THE

1911
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,538
DISCIPLINE REQUIRED ON THIS

1912
01:20:10,538 --> 01:20:11,373

WHAT A NIGHT.

1935
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:37,712
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? 

1936
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:41,349
THESE TWO PLAYS COMING HERE FOR

1937
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:42,817
YOU TO SHOW YOUR STUFF? 

1938
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:45,920
MARK: HAS TAKEN QUITE A FEW

1939
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,922
YEARS.

1940
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:51,693
IN PARTICULAR, THE ARTIST,

1941
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,161
DIRECTOR AND CLOTHING AND SET

1942
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:55,030
DESIGNER AND THE MUSICAL

1943
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,998
DIRECTOR, AND THE KIND OF CORE

1944
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:00,668
PLAYERS ARE PEOPLE THAT WORKED

1945
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:02,570
WITH ME A LOT WHEN I WAS

1946
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:04,973
ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AT THE GLOBE.

1947
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,075
WHEN MY TIME FINISHED, MY 10

1948
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:09,110
YEARS FINISHED, I IMMEDIATELY

1949
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:12,113
STARTED TO WANT TO PRESERVE OR

1950
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:13,815
CARRY ON THE ESSENTIAL CORE WORK

1951
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:16,317
OF WHAT WE DID, WHICH WAS A VERY

1952
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:19,287
CAREFUL, AND I HOPE RIGOROUS,

1953
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:21,823
ATTEMPT TO EXPLORE WHAT I CALL

1954
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:25,193
ORIGINAL PLAYING PRACTICES.

1955
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:27,161
HOPEFULLY KNOWN FROM

1956
01:24:27,161 --> 01:24:29,197
SHAKESPEARE'S DAY.

1957
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,399
SO IT TOOK A LONG TIME.

1958
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:32,300
WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT A WAY OF

1959
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,535
MOUNTING TO PRODUCTIONS THAT

1960
01:24:34,535 --> 01:24:35,336
WOULD BE POPULAR ENOUGH TO RAISE

1961
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:40,975
ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE A WHOLE NEW

1962
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:42,744
WARDROBE OF CLOTHES AS THE

1963
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:43,578
ELIZABETHANS SPEND THEIR MONEY

1964
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:44,279
OF WHAT THEY WERE ON THEIR

1965
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:44,646
BACKS.

1966
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:47,315
CHARLIE: WHAT WAS THE TERM YOU

1967
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:50,218
USE IN TERMS OF ORIGINAL

1968
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:50,718
PRODUCTION? 

1969
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:53,755
MARK: ORIGINAL PLAYING

1970
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:54,222
PRACTICES.

1971
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:54,922
THAT INSPIRED WHAT I WANT TO

1972
01:24:54,922 --> 01:25:00,228
MAKE IN AMERICAN -- THE AMERICA

1973
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:01,229
THAT FOUNDED THE GLOBE.

1974
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:02,096
NOT ONLY INTELLECTUAL INQUIRY

1975
01:25:02,096 --> 01:25:05,199
INTO HOW THE PLATE MIGHT HAVE

1976
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:06,167
ORIGINATED, WHAT CONDITIONS

1977
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:08,369
SHAKES YOUR IMAGINED WHEN HE

1978
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:11,306
WROTE THESE -- SHAKESPEARE

1979
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:12,674
IMAGINED WHEN HE WROTE THESE

1980
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:13,474
INCREDIBLE PLACE BUT YOU COULD

1981
01:25:13,474 --> 01:25:15,510
EXPLORE WITH LIVE AUDIENCES AND

1982
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:17,612
LIVE PLAYS.

1983
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,681
SO HE SPENT THE LAST 25 YEARS

1984
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:20,448
BUILDING THE GLOBE THEATER AND

1985
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:22,216
DIED IN 1993, AND I BECAME

1986
01:25:22,216 --> 01:25:26,321
ARTISTIC DIRECTOR IN 1995.

1987
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:29,624
HIS THINKING ABOUT THE GLOBE WAS

1988
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:30,391
REALLY THE INSPIRATION FOR ME,

1989
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:31,159
WHICH WAS HE DEMANDED THREE

1990
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:31,526
THINGS.

1991
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:35,229
I'M A VERY THOROUGH RESEARCH --

1992
01:25:35,229 --> 01:25:37,632
THREE THINGS, VERY, VERY

1993
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:43,104
THOROUGH RESEARCH, MATERIALS,

1994
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:43,871
THE FIRST FACT BUILDING SINCE

1995
01:25:43,871 --> 01:25:44,739
THE GREAT FIRE.

1996
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:47,909
A THOUSAND OAK TREES WENT INTO

1997
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:51,512
IT, LINE CLOTH, ALL KINDS OF OLD

1998
01:25:51,512 --> 01:25:52,914
BUILDING TECHNIQUES AND ORIGINAL

1999
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:53,715
CRAFT SHOULD BE USED AS WELL.

2000
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:56,751
CHARLIE: SO THE PREMISE IS IT

2001
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:57,452
WOULD BE MORE INSIDE OF

2002
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:58,219
SHAKESPEARE'S HEAD IF WE DID

2003
01:25:58,219 --> 01:25:58,887
THAT? 

2004
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:01,656
KENNETH: WE CONFIRMED -- 

2005
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:03,891
MARK: WE CONFIRMED WE WOULD

2006
01:26:03,891 --> 01:26:07,028
LEARN MORE ABOUT THE REASON HE

2007
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:07,795
WROTE THE PLACE AND THE REASON

2008
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:08,296
HE WROTE THEM.

2009
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:11,966
-- THE PLAYS AND THE REASON HE

2010
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:13,968
WROTE THEM.

2011
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:15,837
THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES, HOW

2012
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,805
FAST IT TAKES, HOW FAST DID THEY

2013
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:19,874
PLAY, WERE THE PLACE CUT TWO

2014
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:21,042
HOURS, DID THEY PLAY VERY

2015
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:23,678
RAPIDLY? 

2016
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:27,749
WAS IT TWO HOURS JUST TO DO WITH

2017
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:29,150
AMPHITHEATERS, VERSUS PLAYING

2018
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:32,320
INSIDE? 

2019
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,255
FOR AN ACTOR, THE SPACE IS

2020
01:26:34,255 --> 01:26:34,756
REMARKABLE.

2021
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:38,059
IT IS DAYLIGHT.

2022
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:38,726
THE ONLY PLAYED IN THE

2023
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:40,595
AFTERNOON.

2024
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:41,396
THERE ARE TWO WHOPPING GREAT

2025
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:42,196
PILLARS, SO THERE IS NOWHERE YOU

2026
01:26:42,196 --> 01:26:44,365
CAN STAND WHERE SOME PEOPLE IN

2027
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:47,335
THE AUDIENCE WON'T SEE YOU, BUT

2028
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:48,403
EVERYONE CAN HEAR YOU LIKE A

2029
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:51,372
BELL.

2030
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,508
TO THE FACT THAT AT THAT TIME A

2031
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:55,410
COMMENTATOR LIKE MYSELF, IF THEY

2032
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:56,144
WENT TO THE GLOBE AND SAY, I

2033
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:57,378
WANT TO HEAR JULIUS USER, THEY

2034
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:59,313
NEVER SAID, I WENT TO SEE A

2035
01:26:59,313 --> 01:27:02,517
PLAYER AT THE GLOBE, THEY WENT

2036
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:03,017
TO HEAR IT.

2037
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:05,319
IT IMMEDIATELY DEMANDED IN MY

2038
01:27:05,319 --> 01:27:07,121
TIME AT LEAST, A LOT MORE RIGOR

2039
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:08,256
ON ELOQUENCE.

2040
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:10,525
CHARLIE: BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT

2041
01:27:10,525 --> 01:27:16,130
THESE TWO PLAYS, 10 YEARS AS

2042
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:16,898
ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AT THE GLOBE

2043
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:17,298
THEATER.

2044
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:18,065
IF YOU WERE ASKED TO GIVE A LAST

2045
01:27:18,065 --> 01:27:19,600
LECTURE ABOUT SHAKESPEARE, WHAT

2046
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:20,668
WOULD YOU WANT US TO KNOW? 

2047
01:27:20,668 --> 01:27:25,907
MARK: WHAT COMES TO THE TOP OF

2048
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:26,674
MY HEAD MAY NOT BE THE DEEPEST

2049
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:30,611
ANSWER, BUT YOU JUST CAN'T, YOU

2050
01:27:30,611 --> 01:27:32,113
WILL NEVER GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

2051
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:32,947
HIS SENSE OF HUMOR AND SENSE OF

2052
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:34,916
WIT AND HUMOR.

2053
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:38,253
IT IS WELL-KNOWN THAT ONE OF THE

2054
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,086
GREAT THINGS HE IS REALLY GOOD

2055
01:27:39,086 --> 01:27:42,957
AT DOING IS MARRYING OPPOSITES,

2056
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:46,627
JUXTAPOSING, OPPOSING SOUNDS,

2057
01:27:46,627 --> 01:27:48,563
HOT EYES, COLD FIRE.

2058
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:51,632
ROMEO SAYS AT ONE POINT. ALSO

2059
01:27:51,632 --> 01:27:56,371
JUXTAPOSING TRAGEDY AND COMEDY.

2060
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:57,238
AND HIS DEEP SENSE OF HUMOR EVEN

2061
01:27:57,238 --> 01:27:59,907
THE MOST TRAGIC MOMENTS -- EVEN

2062
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:02,977
IN THE MOST TRAGIC MOMENTS STILL

2063
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:03,511
STAGGERS ME.

2064
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:06,214
I DON'T GENERALLY FIND IT

2065
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:06,614
MYSELF.

2066
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:07,382
I FIND IN PERFORMANCE WITH AN

2067
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:08,349
AUDIENCE THERE IS SOMETHING

2068
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:08,816
ABOUT -- 

2069
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:11,252
CHARLIE: THE AUDIENCE TELLS YOU

2070
01:28:11,252 --> 01:28:11,819
WHAT IS YOURS.

2071
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:16,390
MARK: IT IS A COLLECTIVE THING

2072
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:17,225
THAT HAPPENS WHEN A BUNCH OF

2073
01:28:17,225 --> 01:28:17,959
PEOPLE FOCUS ON ONE THING.

2074
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,294
MAYBE RELIGIONS KNOW THIS AND

2075
01:28:20,294 --> 01:28:21,229
HAVE KNOWN IT FOREVER, BUT IT

2076
01:28:21,229 --> 01:28:23,464
HAPPENS IN THEATERS AS WELL.

2077
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:24,232
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE FOCUSING ON

2078
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:28,970
ONE TOPIC OR ONE-STORY, AND THE

2079
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:29,737
CASE OF SHAKESPEARE, AND THEY

2080
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:30,471
ARE ALL IN THE SAME ROOM, IT

2081
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:34,509
FEELS LIKE EACH INDIVIDUAL IS

2082
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:35,309
CAPABLE OF SOMETHING MORE WHEN

2083
01:28:35,309 --> 01:28:36,311
WE ARE TOGETHER FOCUSED ON

2084
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:39,614
SOMETHING, AS IF THE INTERNET IS

2085
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:40,348
A MANIFESTATION OF SOMETHING

2086
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:42,350
THAT EXISTS NATURALLY IN HUMAN

2087
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:44,018
CONSCIOUSNESS.

2088
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:44,785
THAT THERE IS A COLLECTIVE

2089
01:28:44,785 --> 01:28:45,486
CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE ROOM.

2090
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:49,423
CHARLIE: THE BRAIN, THE

2091
01:28:49,423 --> 01:28:50,258
COALESCING OF ONE THING IS MUCH

2092
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:50,925
LARGER THAN THE SUM OF THE

2093
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:51,459
INDIVIDUAL PARTS.

2094
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:53,361
KENNETH: SO THE -- 

2095
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:56,764
MARK: THE WHICH BECAME THE

2096
01:28:56,764 --> 01:29:00,401
GLOBE, WHICH IS MORE RECTANGULAR

2097
01:29:00,401 --> 01:29:05,106
OR SQUARE SHAPED, AND THE GLOBE

2098
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:05,573
IS CIRCULAR.

2099
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:08,409
THAT COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF

2100
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:10,311
PLAYING THERE FOR 10 YEARS

2101
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:12,280
REALLY AWAKENED THIS TO ME, MORE

2102
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,448
THE SENSE OF HUMOR OF THE

2103
01:29:14,448 --> 01:29:14,849
AUTHOR.

2104
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:17,518
IT IS THE THING I WOULD SAY THAT

2105
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:21,422
I WOULD, I WOULD HOPE WOULD TAKE

2106
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:23,858
A LONG TIME BEFORE THE UNIVERSE

2107
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:24,425
DESTROYS THAT.

2108
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:26,861
CHARLIE: YOUR INTEREST IN

2109
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:27,628
SHAKESPEARE GOES WAY BACK, TO

2110
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:28,095
HIGH SCHOOL? 

2111
01:29:28,095 --> 01:29:31,032
MARK: IT DOES.

2112
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:32,834
I SKIPPED THE REST OF THE PARTY

2113
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:35,236
AND JUST PLAYED HAMILTON WHEN I

2114
01:29:35,236 --> 01:29:35,670
WAS 16.

2115
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:36,137
[LAUGHTER]

2116
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:37,839
CHARLIE: YOU HAVE SINCE PLAYED

2117
01:29:37,839 --> 01:29:40,808
HAMILTON -- HAMLET, ROMEO,

2118
01:29:40,808 --> 01:29:41,208
MACBETH.

2119
01:29:41,208 --> 01:29:46,347
MARK: I HAVE BEEN 52 PRODUCTIONS

2120
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:47,114

CONTEMPORARIES, MIDDLETON,

2122
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:50,718
PEOPLE WHO AT THE TIME -- 

2123
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:52,920
CHARLIE: IS IT ANY BETTER

2124
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,689
TRAINING FOR AN ACTOR? 

2125
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:59,226
MARK: I HOPE SO.

2126
01:29:59,226 --> 01:29:59,961
THERE ARE MUCH BETTER ACTORS

2127
01:29:59,961 --> 01:30:00,328
THAN ME.

2128
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:03,698
CHARLIE: NO, NO, TO GET INTO

2129
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:04,498
SHAKESPEARE AND SHAKESPEAREAN

2130
01:30:04,498 --> 01:30:04,932
CALENDARS.

2131
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:05,967
IS THAT THE BEST POSSIBLE

2132
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:06,767
TRAINING FOR AN ACTOR? 

2133
01:30:06,767 --> 01:30:11,472
MARK: NO, I WOULD NOT SAY THAT.

2134
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:12,306
I AM NOT SOMEONE WHO'S ONLY

2135
01:30:12,306 --> 01:30:15,343
OPINION IS SHAKESPEARE SHOULD BE

2136
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:16,143
MEANT FOR EVERYONE OR LOVED BY

2137
01:30:16,143 --> 01:30:16,544
EVERYONE.

2138
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:18,112
CHARLIE: OR SOMEHOW BECAUSE OF

2139
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:22,350
THE RANGE, IT GIVES YOU AN

2140
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:23,317
OPPORTUNITY TO DIG DEEP IN

2141
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:25,119
UNDERSTANDING HUMAN NATURE,

2142
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:25,953
THEREFORE UNDERSTANDING ACTING

2143
01:30:25,953 --> 01:30:27,955
OR LARGER ABILITY TO INHABIT

2144
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:29,257
DIFFERENT CHARACTERS? 

2145
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:32,293
MARK: IT DEPENDS HOW YOU

2146
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:32,793
APPROACH IT.

2147
01:30:32,793 --> 01:30:36,297
YOU AND I COULD GET A SET OF

2148
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:39,467
PAINTS WHERE WE DO NOT

01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:40,234
NECESSARILY COME UP WITH THE

01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:40,668
SAME THING.

2151
01:30:40,668 --> 01:30:43,671
CHARLIE: IT DOES NOT COME FROM

2152
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:44,472
THE PAINTING, IT COMES FROM THE

2153
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:44,805
HEAD.

2154
01:30:44,805 --> 01:30:50,077

2156
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:52,413
WITH SHAKESPEAREAN MATERIAL.

I DON'T KNOW THAT ROBERT ORDERED

TRACY OR CLIFF -- BRANDO

2159
01:31:02,189 --> 01:31:05,393

PERFORMANCES FOR MY TASTE I HAVE

IT WAS LIKE A WOODEN O, AND TV

2205
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:52,533
IS A WOODEN O.

2206
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:55,369
THAT IS LIKE EXPANDING IT.

2213
01:33:08,382 --> 01:33:12,620
ARISTOCRACY WOULD SIT AND WATCH.

2214
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:15,356
IS MORE OR LESS THE SAME NOW.

2215
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:20,528
PEOPLE QUEUE FOR A LONG TIME IN

2216
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:23,598
LINE TO GET A STANDING UP SEATS

2217
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:27,768
, BECAUSE THEY LOVE IT.

2218
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:28,569
AND THE RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE

2219
01:33:28,569 --> 01:33:32,406
WITH THE AUDIENCE IS, THERE IS

2220
01:33:32,406 --> 01:33:32,940
NOTHING LIKE IT.

2221
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,776
YOU REALIZE EVERY SOLILOQUY IS A

2222
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:36,310
CONVERSATION.

2223
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:39,480
CHARLIE: IT IS AN ALL-MALE CAST.

2224
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,682
STEPHEN: IT IS LIKE AN ORIGINAL

2225
01:33:41,682 --> 01:33:45,786
PRACTICES CAST.

2226
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:47,488
SO EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF THE

2227
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:52,193
PLAY IS AS FAR AS DRASTICALLY WE

2228
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:52,993
KNOW, ABSOLUTELY AS IT WOULD

2229
01:33:52,993 --> 01:33:53,861
HAVE BEEN IN SHAKESPEARE'S DAY.

2230
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:55,496
WE ALSO NOTE 12 NIGHT WAS

2231
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:59,400
PERFORMED INDOORS, IN A TEMPLE,

2232
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,269
ONE OF THE HOLES, MEDIEVAL HOLES

2233
01:34:02,269 --> 01:34:07,608
THE -- HALLS USED BY LAWYERS.

2234
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:09,510
WE KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

2235
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:11,979
BECAUSE IT HAS NOT CHANGED.

2236
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:12,847
AND IT HAPPENED A LOT BECAUSE IT

2237
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:15,416
WAS PRETTY FAMOUS.

2238
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:16,417
DURING THE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT,

2239
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:20,454
YOU CAN USE THE WOODEN THEATER,

2240
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:21,222
BUT YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE

2241
01:34:21,222 --> 01:34:22,556
YEAR TO KEEP YOUR ACTORS AND

2242
01:34:22,556 --> 01:34:23,090
FROM STARVATION.

2243
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:27,695
SO YOU 02 LAWYERS -- YOU GO TO

2244
01:34:27,695 --> 01:34:30,764
LAWYERS HALLS AND PLAY YOUR

2245
01:34:30,764 --> 01:34:35,235
PLAY.

2246
01:34:35,235 --> 01:34:37,271
AND THIS NEW ONE WAS CLEARLY

2247
01:34:37,271 --> 01:34:37,872
WRITTEN FOR INDOOR.

2248
01:34:37,872 --> 01:34:39,306
YOU CAN SORT OF TELL.

2249
01:34:39,306 --> 01:34:40,140
AND FOR INTELLIGENT LAWYERS AND

2250
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:41,809
PEOPLE TO COME WATCH, WHICH IS

2251
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:43,777
NOT TO SAY IT IS A VERY

2252
01:34:43,777 --> 01:34:44,311
DIFFICULT PLAY.

2253
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:47,048
IT IS HILARIOUS, AND IS FAST.

2254
01:34:47,048 --> 01:34:52,186
CHARLIE: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

2255
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:52,953
YOUR CHARACTER, BUT LET ME GO

2256
01:34:52,953 --> 01:34:53,287
BACK.

2257
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:53,954
DID YOU WANT TO BE A SIX.

2258
01:34:53,954 --> 01:34:55,222
SCHOLAR? 

2259
01:34:55,222 --> 01:34:56,090
-- DID YOU WANT TO BE A

2260
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:59,193
SHAKESPEAREAN SCHOLAR? 

2261
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:00,127
CAMBRIDGE.

2262
01:35:00,127 --> 01:35:04,164
STEPHEN: I FOUND IT EASIEST TO

2263
01:35:04,164 --> 01:35:04,932
WRITE ON SHAKESPEARE, I LOVED

2264
01:35:04,932 --> 01:35:08,102
HIS PLAYS, PERFORMING THEM AT

2265
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:09,670
CAMBRIDGE.

2266
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:12,606
I THOUGHT I WOULD DO A THESIS,

2267
01:35:12,606 --> 01:35:13,440
DOCTORAL THESIS ON SOME ASPECT

2268
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,444
OF SHAKESPEARE.

2269
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:17,177
AND GO TO A CORNER OF THE

2270
01:35:17,177 --> 01:35:18,879
COLLEGE SOMEWHERE.

2271
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:21,248
ONE OF MY CONTEMPORARIES HAS

2272
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:22,183
BECOME THE GREATEST

2273
01:35:22,183 --> 01:35:23,918
SHAKESPEAREAN SCHOLAR IN

2274
01:35:23,918 --> 01:35:25,152
BRITAIN, JONATHAN BATES.

2275
01:35:25,152 --> 01:35:28,188
CHARLIE: TALK TO ME ABOUT THE

2276
01:35:28,188 --> 01:35:29,356
PART.

2277
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:30,191
MALVOLIO? 

2278
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:32,860
STEPHEN: MALVOLIO.

2279
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:35,429
VERY SOME -- VERY HARD TO SAY

2280
01:35:35,429 --> 01:35:39,900
WHO IS RIGHT.

2281
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:40,701
AMERICAN ENGLISH IS SAID TO BE

2282
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:42,303
THE CURRENT ENGLISH OF

2283
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:43,270
SHAKESPEARE.

2284
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:47,541
MALVOLIO MEANS, IT IS SORT OF

2285
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:48,342
LATIN, AND IT MEANS ILL WILL.

2286
01:35:48,342 --> 01:35:55,149
THIS CHARACTER, WHICH MEANS ILL

2287
01:35:55,149 --> 01:35:58,519
DISPOSED.

2288
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:01,522
ALSO RATHER BIZARRELY THERE ARE

2289
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:03,457
THESE AND A GRAMMATIC

2290
01:36:03,457 --> 01:36:10,397
CONNECTIONS -- ANAGRAMATIC WITH

2291
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:15,603
VIOLA AND MALVOLIO.

2292
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17,504
VIOLA IS IN MOURNING AND THAT

2293
01:36:17,504 --> 01:36:18,072
HER BROTHER DIES.

2294
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:19,774
SO SHE IS IN CHARGE OF THIS VAST

2295
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:21,509
ESTATE AND SHE HAS A STEWARD,

2296
01:36:21,509 --> 01:36:23,010
MALVOLIO.

2297
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:26,046
AND SHE HAS AN UNCLE, UNCLE

2298
01:36:26,046 --> 01:36:29,516
TOBY, WHO IS AT DRINKER.

2299
01:36:29,516 --> 01:36:30,584
AND SHE HAS A CHAMBERMAID AND A

2300
01:36:30,584 --> 01:36:32,686
FOOL WHO TELLS US THINGS YOU

2301
01:36:32,686 --> 01:36:34,622
DON'T LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT.

2302
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:37,691
AND THE NEARBY DUKE IS DEEPLY

2303
01:36:37,691 --> 01:36:42,663
INTO LOVE WITH HER, BUT HE

2304
01:36:42,663 --> 01:36:43,430
SWEARS IN SEVEN YEARS YOU WILL

2305
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:44,665
WEAR A VEIL.

2306
01:36:44,665 --> 01:36:47,501
THE SHIPWRECK HAPPENS WHERE HER

2307
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:49,737
TWIN BROTHER AND SISTER, EACH

2308
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:51,405
BELIEVE THE OTHER DROWNED.

2309
01:36:51,405 --> 01:36:55,009
THE SISTER COMES UP AND THE SEA

2310
01:36:55,009 --> 01:36:56,811
CAPTAIN WHO HAS RESCUED HER, SHE

2311
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,445
SAID, WHAT CAN A WOMAN TO ON HER

2312
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:01,715
OWN, WHAT IS IT? 

2313
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:03,851
OH, MY BROTHER IS DROWNED, HOW

2314
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:05,920
WILL I GET BACK TO WHERE I COME

2315
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:06,353
FROM? 

2316
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:09,723
I HAVE THIS TRUNK OF CLOTHES

2317
01:37:09,723 --> 01:37:10,457
WITH MY BROTHER CLOTHES.

2318
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:14,128
ADDRESS ME AS A MAN, TAKE ME --

2319
01:37:14,128 --> 01:37:14,928
DRESS ME AS A MAN, TAKE ME TO

2320
01:37:14,928 --> 01:37:17,865
THE LOCAL PLACE.

2321
01:37:17,865 --> 01:37:19,700
AND THIS MAN IS A UNIT, SO

2322
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:20,968
PROBABLY A BLACK BOY.

2323
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:23,570
SHE DRESSES AS A BOY, CALLED

2324
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:24,939
HERSELF ROSARIO.

2325
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:30,344
AND THEN OLIVIA STARTS TO FALL

2326
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:31,145
IN LOVE, BUT WE KNOW SHE IS A

2327
01:37:31,145 --> 01:37:31,478
GIRL.

2328
01:37:31,478 --> 01:37:33,914
AND SEBASTIAN HAS SURVIVED AND

2329
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:36,050
LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME, AND HE

2330
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:38,218
IS BEING TAKEN AWAY BY ANTONIO,

2331
01:37:38,218 --> 01:37:38,819
AN OLD PIRATE.

2332
01:37:38,819 --> 01:37:42,756
WE DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT IT IS

2333
01:37:42,756 --> 01:37:44,892
USED BY THOSE WHO PUSH THE

2334
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:45,859
HOMOEROTIC NATURE OF

2335
01:37:45,859 --> 01:37:46,326
SHAKESPEARE.

2336
01:37:46,326 --> 01:37:49,263
HE TALKS ABOUT ABSOLUTE DEVOTION

2337
01:37:49,263 --> 01:37:53,000
AND LOVE, PURE LOVE OF

2338
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,434
SEBASTIAN.

2339
01:37:53,434 --> 01:37:58,705
THEY NEVER MEET UNTIL THE FINAL,

2340
01:37:58,705 --> 01:37:59,440
ABSOLUTELY FARCICAL MOMENTS

2341
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,041
WHERE THEY ARE ON STAGE AT THE

2342
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:03,844
SAME TIME LOOKING IDENTICAL.

2343
01:38:03,844 --> 01:38:07,481
AND ANTONIO, HE SAYS SEBASTIAN,

2344
01:38:07,481 --> 01:38:08,549
ARE YOU? 

2345
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:11,552
HE SAYS, HOW CAN YOU TELL? 

2346
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:14,288
HE SAID, HOW HAVE YOU DIVIDED

2347
01:38:14,288 --> 01:38:15,556
YOURSELF? 

2348
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:18,425
AND THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER, AND

2349
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:19,460
THE CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

2350
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:23,564
AND IT MEANS THAT VIOLA CAN

2351
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:26,467
ACTUALLY MANDATE -- MARY

2352
01:38:26,467 --> 01:38:27,267
SEBASTIAN, WHO LOOKS EXACTLY THE

2353
01:38:27,267 --> 01:38:28,535
SAME AS THE GIRL SHE WANTED TO

2354
01:38:28,535 --> 01:38:30,738
MARRY, AND THE GIRL TO MARRY THE

2355
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:31,138
DUKE.

2356
01:38:31,138 --> 01:38:33,540
AND I HAVE A TERRIBLE TRICK

2357
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:38,445
PLAYED ON ME BECAUSE I AM A

2358
01:38:38,445 --> 01:38:40,047
SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME, A

2359
01:38:40,047 --> 01:38:40,514
PURITAN.

2360
01:38:40,514 --> 01:38:42,850
I AM DESCRIBED AS A CURATIVE.

2361
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:45,586
HE TALKS ABOUT THE DEVIL,

2362
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:46,987
WHETHER HE THINKS WILL IMPRESS

2363
01:38:46,987 --> 01:38:47,387
PEOPLE.

2364
01:38:47,387 --> 01:38:48,923
BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T LIKE OTHER

2365
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:49,389
PEOPLE.

2366
01:38:49,389 --> 01:38:50,824
I LIKE TO BE THE BOSS, AND I AM

2367
01:38:50,824 --> 01:38:54,595
PLEASED WITH MYSELF AND ASSUME

2368
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:55,262
EVERY BUDDY ADORES ME.

2369
01:38:55,262 --> 01:38:56,063
THEY PLAY THIS VERY, VERY CRUEL

2370
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:57,998
TRICK ON ME.

2371
01:38:57,998 --> 01:39:01,568
IT LOOKS AS IF IT IS A SECRET

2372
01:39:01,568 --> 01:39:04,872
FROM OLIVIA, THE COUNTESS, TO ME

2373
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:05,672
TO SAY SHE LOVES ME AND TELLING

2374
01:39:05,672 --> 01:39:06,640
ME TO WHERE PARTICULAR CLOTHES

2375
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:11,178
-- WEAR PARTICULAR CLOTHES.

2376
01:39:11,178 --> 01:39:12,012
AND TO SMILE ALL THE TIME.

2377
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:15,649
AND SHE HATES THE OTHER PERSON,

2378
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:18,919
AND DOES NOT LIKE PEOPLE SMILING

2379
01:39:18,919 --> 01:39:19,653
WHEN SHE IS GRIEVING FOR HER

2380
01:39:19,653 --> 01:39:21,055
BROTHER.

2381
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:25,225
SO IT IS ULTIMATELY MALVOLIO THE

2382
01:39:25,225 --> 01:39:27,094
FOOL WHO ENDS UP IN PRISON.

2383
01:39:27,094 --> 01:39:30,931
CHARLIE: TELL ME HOW YOU

2384
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:31,732
APPROACHED, AND WHAT WAS IT FOR

2385
01:39:31,732 --> 01:39:34,268
YOU AS AN ACTOR TO GET INSIDE OF

2386
01:39:34,268 --> 01:39:35,135
MALVOLIO? 

2387
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:37,938
STEPHEN: SOME PEOPLE MENTION HE

2388
01:39:37,938 --> 01:39:43,277
IS US POMPOUS -- A POMPOUS, SELF

2389
01:39:43,277 --> 01:39:45,346
REGARDING ASS.

2390
01:39:45,346 --> 01:39:47,881
PEOPLE OFTEN FIND IT

2391
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:51,352
PRETENTIOUS.

2392
01:39:51,352 --> 01:39:54,655
OUR JOB IS SIMPLY TO ENTERTAIN

2393
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:55,022
PEOPLE.

2394
01:39:55,022 --> 01:39:55,822
WE DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO

2395
01:39:55,822 --> 01:39:56,590
EXPLAIN THE PROCESS, BUT PEOPLE

2396
01:39:56,590 --> 01:39:58,359
ASK SO WE RIGHTFULLY AND HER.

2397
01:39:58,359 --> 01:40:01,128
AND YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE -- WE

2398
01:40:01,128 --> 01:40:02,996
RIGHTFULLY ANSWER.

2399
01:40:02,996 --> 01:40:05,365
AND YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THESE

2400
01:40:05,365 --> 01:40:05,899
ARE REAL PEOPLE.

2401
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:08,368
IN GENERAL -- MOBILE YOU THINKS

2402
01:40:08,368 --> 01:40:12,539
HE IS TAKING THE HOUSE --

2403
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:13,273
MALVOLIO THINKS HE IS TAKING

2404
01:40:13,273 --> 01:40:13,840
CARE OF THE HOUSE.

2405
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:17,578
HE THINKS HE WOULD MAKE A

2406
01:40:17,578 --> 01:40:18,412
WONDERFUL HUSBAND FOR OLIVIA AND

2407
01:40:18,412 --> 01:40:19,580
THINKS IT THERE IS AN EXAMPLE,

2408
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:21,515
THE LADY OF THE STRAIGHT MARRIED

2409
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:22,516
THE WARDROBE.

2410
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:26,386
THERE ARE LOCAL REFERENCES TO

2411
01:40:26,386 --> 01:40:27,387
TIMES WHEN A SERVANT HAS MARRIED

2412
01:40:27,387 --> 01:40:30,791
THE MISTRESS OR MASTER.

2413
01:40:30,791 --> 01:40:33,060
SO HE JUST GOES OFF INTO A

2414
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:33,560
FANTASYLAND.

2415
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:34,328
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE PLAYED HIM

2416
01:40:34,328 --> 01:40:35,629
QUITE WICKED OR HIGHLY COMIC.

2417
01:40:35,629 --> 01:40:37,631

HE HAS WON EMMYS AND TONY AWARDS

ON STAGE, TWICE OSCAR-NOMINATED

2423

FOR HIS WORK IN FILM.

2424
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:31,405
HE IS PLAYING ONE OF THE MOST

2425
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:32,172
DEMANDING AND CHALLENGING PARTS

2426
01:43:32,172 --> 01:43:34,875
EVER WRITTEN FOR THE STAGE.

2427
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:35,709
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW I AM TALKING

2428
01:43:35,709 --> 01:43:38,478
ABOUT KING LEAR.

2429
01:43:38,478 --> 01:43:41,581
THIS IS A SHAKESPEARE IN THE

2430
01:43:41,581 --> 01:43:42,315
PARK PRODUCTION AT DELACORTE

2431
01:43:42,315 --> 01:43:43,116
THEATER IN NEW YORK CENTRAL PARK

2432
01:43:43,116 --> 01:43:45,419
THROUGH AUGUST 17.

2433
01:43:45,419 --> 01:43:46,553
I AM VERY PLEASED TO HAVE JOHN

2434
01:43:46,553 --> 01:43:49,556
LITHGOW ON THIS PROGRAM.

2435
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:52,659
JOHN: GREAT TO BE HERE, CHARLIE.

2436
01:43:52,659 --> 01:43:58,632
CHARLIE: HOW DOES JOHN AND KING

2437
01:43:58,632 --> 01:43:59,332
LEAR COME HERE TOGETHER? 

2438
01:43:59,332 --> 01:44:02,936
JOHN: THE PLATE IS MUCH GREATER

2439
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:03,403
THAN I AM.

2440
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:04,838
I HAVE BEEN NAGGING SOMEONE TO

2441
01:44:04,838 --> 01:44:07,774
CONSIDER ME FOR IT.

2442
01:44:07,774 --> 01:44:09,810
PROBABLY, THE FIRST I MENTIONED

2443
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:12,679
IT TO HIM IS PROBABLY LONG

2444
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:13,480
BEFORE I SHOULD HAVE PLAYED IT.

2445
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,449
BUT NOW I THINK I HAVE JUST

2446
01:44:15,449 --> 01:44:17,818
ENTERED THAT INTERESTING WINDOW

2447
01:44:17,818 --> 01:44:21,588
OF OPPORTUNITY FOR LEAR, WHEN

2448
01:44:21,588 --> 01:44:22,789
YOUR YOUNG ENOUGH TO PLAY IT

2449
01:44:22,789 --> 01:44:23,590
WHEN YOU STILL HAVE THE STRENGTH

2450
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:25,892
BUT OLD ENOUGH TO PLAY IT

2451
01:44:25,892 --> 01:44:26,526
BECAUSE YOU CAN BRING

2452
01:44:26,526 --> 01:44:28,528
AUTHENTICITY TO AN OLD MAN

2453
01:44:28,528 --> 01:44:30,931
LOSING HIS VIABILITY.

2454
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:31,965
I KNOW IT BETTER THAN I EVEN

2455
01:44:31,965 --> 01:44:33,733
REALIZED.

2456
01:44:33,733 --> 01:44:34,568
I HAVE SEEN IT SO MANY TIMES IN

2457
01:44:34,568 --> 01:44:34,968
MY LIFE.

2458
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:38,972
I PLAYED IT IN COLLEGE.

2459
01:44:38,972 --> 01:44:42,175
BUT I FIGURED IT IS GOING TO BE

2460
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:42,809
SUCH A DEMANDING PART.

2461
01:44:42,809 --> 01:44:43,810
THE REHEARSAL PERIOD IS GOING

2462
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:50,283
TO BE SO, SO TOUGH.

2463
01:44:50,283 --> 01:44:51,051
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS

2464
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:51,952
TO GO HOME AND STUDY WORDS AT

2465
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:52,319
NIGHT.

2466
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:53,920
SO I LEARNED IT COMPLETELY COLD

2467
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:54,721
ON THE FIRST DAY OF REVERSAL.

2468
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:56,122
THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER DONE

2469
01:44:56,122 --> 01:44:56,490
THAT.

2470
01:44:56,490 --> 01:44:59,726
SURE ENOUGH, I MEAN, IT WAS A

2471
01:44:59,726 --> 01:45:01,928
PROCESS OF STAMINA BUILDING,

2472
01:45:01,928 --> 01:45:02,429
REHEARSING IT.

2473
01:45:02,429 --> 01:45:06,033
CHARLIE: TALK ABOUT LEARNING.

2474
01:45:06,033 --> 01:45:08,969
YOU HAD A UCLA STUDENT COMING

2475
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:09,803
IN, HE WOULD YOU USE A YOU KNEW

2476
01:45:09,803 --> 01:45:11,071
THE LINES THAT LED TO -- HE

2477
01:45:11,071 --> 01:45:16,376
WOULD CUE YOU SO YOU KNEW THE

2478
01:45:16,376 --> 01:45:17,110
LINES TO COME IN? 

2479
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:21,181
JOHN: IN MY DAYS ON THIRD ROCK

2480
01:45:21,181 --> 01:45:23,116
FROM THE SUN, I WORKED OUT AN

2481
01:45:23,116 --> 01:45:26,219
EXTREMELY EFFICIENT WAY OF

2482
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:30,257
MEMORIZING GREAT GOBS OF

2483
01:45:30,257 --> 01:45:32,592
MATERIAL BECAUSE IT CAME AT YOU

2484
01:45:32,592 --> 01:45:34,628
VERY FAST AND WAS VERY WORDY AND

2485
01:45:34,628 --> 01:45:35,228
FAST-PACED SHOW.

2486
01:45:35,228 --> 01:45:38,332
I TRAINED MY ASSISTANT TO FEED

2487
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:45,405
ME MY LINES WITH A THREE MINUTE

2488
01:45:45,405 --> 01:45:48,508
PAUSE, THREE SECOND PAUSE

2489
01:45:48,508 --> 01:45:51,611
BETWEEN EVERY SINGLE WORD.

2490
01:45:51,611 --> 01:45:55,048
AND I WOULD DRILL THE LINE IN

2491
01:45:55,048 --> 01:45:57,484
ALL THOSE PAUSES, AND I CAN

2492
01:45:57,484 --> 01:45:59,352
LEARN A SPEECH LIKE THAT ONCE

2493
01:45:59,352 --> 01:46:00,987
THROUGH.

2494
01:46:00,987 --> 01:46:01,755
THAT IS HOW I WENT ABOUT

2495
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:02,188
STUDYING.

2496
01:46:02,188 --> 01:46:04,591
CHARLIE: THE IDEA OF MEMORIZING

2497
01:46:04,591 --> 01:46:05,625
THINGS IS A GREAT FASCINATION

2498
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:06,026
FOR ME.

2499
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,862
JOHN: IT GETS HARDER AS YOU GET

2500
01:46:08,862 --> 01:46:09,262
OLDER.

2501
01:46:09,262 --> 01:46:10,664
CHARLIE: MAKING SPEECHES.

2502
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:14,834
JOHN: YES, RIGHT, THAT WHOLE

2503
01:46:14,834 --> 01:46:15,235
THING.

2504
01:46:15,235 --> 01:46:16,670
WITH LEAR, THERE IS ALSO A

2505
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:21,541
SERVER PER -- SUPERB INTERNAL

2506
01:46:21,541 --> 01:46:24,077
LOGIC TO THE WRITING.

2507
01:46:24,077 --> 01:46:24,911
I HAVE ABSORBED IT OVER THE

2508
01:46:24,911 --> 01:46:27,747
YEARS, ALL THOSE BRILLIANT AND

2509
01:46:27,747 --> 01:46:28,281
VIVID SPEECHES.

2510
01:46:28,281 --> 01:46:30,784
CHARLIE: WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE

2511
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:32,753
OF PLAYING IT OUTSIDE? 

2512
01:46:32,753 --> 01:46:36,957
JOHN: IT IS LESS OF A CHALLENGE

2513
01:46:36,957 --> 01:46:37,924
THAN A MARVELOUS OPPORTUNITY.

2514
01:46:37,924 --> 01:46:40,493
IT IS A BIG PLAY FULL OF

2515
01:46:40,493 --> 01:46:43,029
GIGANTIC PASSIONS AND GIGANTIC

2516
01:46:43,029 --> 01:46:50,070
IDEAS, AND I AM A VERY, VERY

2517
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,670
TOLERABLE ACTOR.

2518
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:51,338
IT IS AS BIG AS THE BIG

2519
01:46:51,338 --> 01:46:51,738
OUTDOORS.

2520
01:46:51,738 --> 01:46:54,908
AT THE DELACORTE WITH HIS HUNGRY

2521
01:46:54,908 --> 01:46:56,610
AUDIENCE, AN AUDIENCE OF

2522
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:57,844
PASSIONATE NEW YORK THEATERGOERS

2523
01:46:57,844 --> 01:46:58,678
WHO HAVE WAITED ALL DAY TO GET

2524
01:46:58,678 --> 01:47:01,748
THEIR TICKETS, THEY ARE SO

2525
01:47:01,748 --> 01:47:04,918
HUNGRY FOR IT, THEY ARE

2526
01:47:04,918 --> 01:47:05,619
COMPLETELY GRIPPED BY IT.

2527
01:47:05,619 --> 01:47:07,787
WHEN THE ELEMENTS COME ALONG, WE

2528
01:47:07,787 --> 01:47:12,025
HAD TWO NIGHTS OF RAIN, AND YET

2529
01:47:12,025 --> 01:47:12,826
WE PERFORMED THE THING ANYWAY,

2530
01:47:12,826 --> 01:47:13,727
THEY STAY RIGHT WITH US.

2531
01:47:13,727 --> 01:47:14,828
IN FACT, THEY THINK IT IS EVEN

2532
01:47:14,828 --> 01:47:16,163
BETTER.

2533
01:47:16,163 --> 01:47:20,333
AFTER ALL, I DO GET TO SAY "BLOW

2534
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:20,800
WINDS." 

2535
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:25,172
CHARLIE: THE IDEA OF SO MANY

2536
01:47:25,172 --> 01:47:27,807
GREAT ACTORS PERFORMING THIS,

2537
01:47:27,807 --> 01:47:29,476
DID PREPARATION INCLUDE

2538
01:47:29,476 --> 01:47:30,276
WATCHING, UNDERSTANDING, LOOKING

2539
01:47:30,276 --> 01:47:31,244
AT THOSE PERFORMANCES NOT TOO

2540
01:47:31,244 --> 01:47:33,113
INTERPRETED -- NOT TO COPY THEM

2541
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:35,315
BUT TO UNDERSTAND THE RANGE OF

2542
01:47:35,315 --> 01:47:38,284
INVITATION -- OF INTERPRETATION?

2543
01:47:38,418 --> 01:47:42,188
JOHN: I CALCULATED THIS OVER THE

2544
01:47:42,188 --> 01:47:44,891
YEARS, AND YOU REMEMBER ALL

2545
01:47:44,891 --> 01:47:45,759
SORTS OF THINGS ABOUT INDIVIDUAL

2546
01:47:45,759 --> 01:47:46,259
PERFORMANCES.

2547
01:47:46,259 --> 01:47:49,529
THE MOST VIVID I THINK WITH THE

2548
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:50,263
VERY FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES I

2549
01:47:50,263 --> 01:47:54,334
SIZE, I SAW -- COUPLE OF TIMES I

2550
01:47:54,334 --> 01:47:58,338
SAW, I SAW POLSKA APPEALED DO

2551
01:47:58,338 --> 01:47:58,672
IT.

2552
01:47:58,672 --> 01:48:02,242
THAT WAS LOOK -- PAUL SCOFFIELD

2553
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:03,543
DO IT.

2554
01:48:03,543 --> 01:48:08,281
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF LEARS,

2555
01:48:08,281 --> 01:48:09,015
AND I STOPPED SEEING THEM.

2556
01:48:09,015 --> 01:48:12,819
THE LAST ONE WAS DEREK JACOBI.

2557
01:48:12,819 --> 01:48:13,620
I DID NOT SEE FRANK GORE SIMON

2558
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:18,992
RUSSELL BEALE OR OTHERS.

2559
01:48:18,992 --> 01:48:19,826
BUT AT SOME POINT I HAD TO MAKE

2560
01:48:19,826 --> 01:48:21,661
IT COMPLETELY MY OWN WITH NO ONE

2561
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:22,328
SITTING ON MY SHOULDER.

2562
01:48:22,328 --> 01:48:24,865
CHARLIE: DID YOU SEE IT, WHAT

2563
01:48:24,865 --> 01:48:25,732
THE PRODUCTION PUT ON BY YOUR

2564
01:48:25,732 --> 01:48:26,566
FATHER? 

2565
01:48:26,566 --> 01:48:30,737
JOHN: NO, HE DID NOT PUT IT ON,

2566
01:48:30,737 --> 01:48:33,406
BUT WHEN HE PUT KING LEAR ON, I

2567
01:48:33,406 --> 01:48:34,040
WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD.

2568
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:35,909
MY PARENTS YOU I WOULDN'T LAST

2569
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:36,743
TO THE END.

2570
01:48:36,743 --> 01:48:40,613
NO, THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT WAS

2571
01:48:40,613 --> 01:48:42,449
IN 1962, THE FIRST SEASON OF

2572
01:48:42,449 --> 01:48:43,717
SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARK AT THE

2573
01:48:43,717 --> 01:48:45,485
DELACORTE WITH FRANK SILVERA IN

2574
01:48:45,485 --> 01:48:46,620
THE ROLE.

2575
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:49,689
AND HE COMPLETELY THROTTLED ME.

2576
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:54,361
THAT, YOU REMEMBER, YOU REMEMBER

2577
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:55,195
JUST THE IMPACT OF A PLAY LIKE

2578
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:55,562
THIS.

2579
01:48:55,562 --> 01:48:56,663
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW

2580
01:48:56,663 --> 01:48:57,297
DEATH OF A SALESMAN.

2581
01:48:57,297 --> 01:48:59,933
CHARLIE: ARE THERE OTHER THINGS

2582
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:01,568
YOU VERY MUCH WANT TO PLAY THAT

2583
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:03,737
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS

2584
01:49:03,737 --> 01:49:04,971
YOU HAVE DONE, ARE THERE MISSING

2585
01:49:04,971 --> 01:49:07,373
ELEMENTS FOR YOU IN TERMS OF

2586
01:49:07,373 --> 01:49:11,278
GREAT CHARACTERS? 

2587
01:49:11,278 --> 01:49:12,112
JOHN: I WOULD SAY THE ONLY ONE

2588
01:49:12,112 --> 01:49:14,147
WASJOHN: KING LEAR.

2589
01:49:14,147 --> 01:49:16,883
I DON'T HAVE ANY BUCKET LIST TO

2590
01:49:16,883 --> 01:49:20,287
PLAY OR PART ANYMORE.

2591
01:49:20,287 --> 01:49:22,289
I AM ABOUT TO DO A DELICATE

2592
01:49:22,289 --> 01:49:24,057
BALANCE ON BROADWAY, AND I AM

2593
01:49:24,057 --> 01:49:26,259
THRILLED TO BE DOING THAT, BUT

2594
01:49:26,259 --> 01:49:27,060
IT IS NOT SOMETHING I AM WAITING

2595
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,027
MY WHOLE CAREER TO DO.

2596
01:49:28,027 --> 01:49:30,196
KING LEAR IS.

2597
01:49:30,196 --> 01:49:31,998
IN MY EXPERIENCE, ALL OF THE

2598
01:49:31,998 --> 01:49:35,235
MOST EXCITING THINGS I HAVE DONE

2599
01:49:35,235 --> 01:49:37,403
HAVE BEEN OTHER PEOPLE'S BRIGHT

2600
01:49:37,403 --> 01:49:38,238
IDEAS, THINGS THAT I NEVER EVEN

2601
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:40,173
THOUGHT OF MYSELF FOR.

2602
01:49:40,173 --> 01:49:40,907
OTHER PEOPLE THINK OF YOU IN

2603
01:49:40,907 --> 01:49:43,409
WAYS THAT YOU DON'T, SOMETIMES

2604
01:49:43,409 --> 01:49:44,210
IN WAYS YOU DON'T THINK OF

2605
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:44,611
YOURSELF.

2606
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:45,378
CHARLIE: TELL ME WHO HE IS, WHO

2607
01:49:45,378 --> 01:49:47,213
IS LEAR?

2608
01:49:47,213 --> 01:49:52,786
JOHN: IN OUR LEAR, WE SEE HIM AS

2609
01:49:52,786 --> 01:49:55,889
A VERY EXUBERANT AND MANIC AND

2610
01:49:55,889 --> 01:49:58,458
EXCITING MAN, BELOVED MONARCH.

2611
01:49:58,458 --> 01:50:02,228
BUT HE IS AGING TO THE POINT

2612
01:50:02,228 --> 01:50:03,062
WHERE HE IS PROBABLY ALWAYS HAD

2613
01:50:03,062 --> 01:50:07,467
A STRAIN OF MANIC TEMPER.

2614
01:50:07,467 --> 01:50:12,605
AND IT IS DAN SULLIVAN'S

2615
01:50:12,605 --> 01:50:16,409
WONDERFUL CONCEPT, IN MY OPINION

2616
01:50:16,409 --> 01:50:17,210
, THE FIRST TIME YOU SEE HIM HE

2617
01:50:17,210 --> 01:50:19,379
IS EXTREMELY EXCITED ABOUT THIS

2618
01:50:19,379 --> 01:50:21,948
PLAN FOR DIVIDING HIS KINGDOM.

2619
01:50:21,948 --> 01:50:22,782
LIKE IT IS SOMETHING HE HAS NOT

2620
01:50:22,782 --> 01:50:24,150
REALLY THOUGHT THROUGH YET.

2621
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:28,454
AND HIS FOOL IS IN THE SCENE.

2622
01:50:28,454 --> 01:50:29,255
YOU GET A SENSE OF HIM BEING A

2623
01:50:29,255 --> 01:50:32,392
VERY ROBUST MAN WITH A HUGE,

2624
01:50:32,392 --> 01:50:33,727
OPEN HEART, AND A GREAT SENSE OF

2625
01:50:33,727 --> 01:50:36,462
HUMOR, BUT HE HAS AGED MORE THAN

2626
01:50:36,462 --> 01:50:37,330
PEOPLE REALIZE.

2627
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:39,666
CHARLIE: SOME PEOPLE ASK THE

2628
01:50:39,666 --> 01:50:44,037
QUESTION, IS HE MAD FROM THE

2629
01:50:44,037 --> 01:50:44,838
BEGINNING, OR DOES HE LOSE HIS

2630
01:50:44,838 --> 01:50:45,538
MIND OVER THE PROCESS OF THE

2631
01:50:45,538 --> 01:50:45,872
PLAY? 

2632
01:50:45,872 --> 01:50:48,508
JOHN: THAT IS ANNEXED TO A GOOD

2633
01:50:48,508 --> 01:50:49,542
QUESTION, AND IS THE NUMBER ONE

2634
01:50:49,542 --> 01:50:52,879
CHALLENGE IS CALCULATING HOW HE

2635
01:50:52,879 --> 01:50:53,913
GOES MAD.

2636
01:50:53,913 --> 01:50:56,549
THERE IS BEGINNINGS OF A

2637
01:50:56,549 --> 01:50:59,652
PROPENSITY OF MADNESS.

2638
01:50:59,652 --> 01:51:00,353
I THINK WHEN HE EXPLODES

2639
01:51:00,353 --> 01:51:03,023
COMPLETELY IRRATIONALLY AT

2640
01:51:03,023 --> 01:51:06,426
CORDELIA, IT IS A SHOCK TO HER.

2641
01:51:06,426 --> 01:51:07,293
SHE HAS PROBABLY SEEN HIS TEMPER

2642
01:51:07,293 --> 01:51:11,231
BEFORE, BUT SHE HAS NEVER SEEN

2643
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:11,731
HIM LIKE THIS.

2644
01:51:11,731 --> 01:51:12,465
SHE HAS NEVER SEEN HIM THAT

2645
01:51:12,465 --> 01:51:12,832
INSANE.

2646
01:51:12,832 --> 01:51:13,566
THIS IS THE FIRST IN HIS WHOLE

2647
01:51:13,566 --> 01:51:16,436
LIFE -- THE PERSON IN HIS WHOLE

2648
01:51:16,436 --> 01:51:17,270
LIFE HE LOVES THE MOST, AND IT

2649
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:19,939
IS BECAUSE OF THE INTENSITY OF

2650
01:51:19,939 --> 01:51:21,808
THAT LOVE THAT HIS ANGER HAS

2651
01:51:21,808 --> 01:51:22,942
SUCH A REACTION.

2652
01:51:22,942 --> 01:51:27,213
FOR EVERYONE, IT IS A NEW SHOCK.

2653
01:51:27,213 --> 01:51:27,914
THEY TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE

2654
01:51:27,914 --> 01:51:29,282
SEEING MORE AND MORE OF THIS.

2655
01:51:29,282 --> 01:51:31,885
AND THEN IN SUCCEEDING SCENES,

2656
01:51:31,885 --> 01:51:34,821
YOU SEE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF

2657
01:51:34,821 --> 01:51:37,724
MADNESS AS HE DECLINES INTO A

2658
01:51:37,724 --> 01:51:41,995
REAL DERANGEMENT AND DEMENTIA,

2659
01:51:41,995 --> 01:51:42,795
AND THE ENTIRE CHALLENGE WITH

2660
01:51:42,795 --> 01:51:48,702
THEM, SULLIVAN'S LIKE EXQUISITE

2661
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:49,569
GUIDANCE, IS JUST FINDING THOSE

2662
01:51:49,569 --> 01:51:52,906
BENCHMARKS, FINDING THE MOMENTS.

2663
01:51:52,906 --> 01:51:54,007
FOR AN EXAMPLE, THE MOMENT WHEN

2664
01:51:54,007 --> 01:52:00,246
HIS MADNESS, HE HAS THESE HUGE

2665
01:52:00,246 --> 01:52:00,947
TEMPER TANTRUMS WITH HIS

2666
01:52:00,947 --> 01:52:03,483
DAUGHTERS, ALL THREE OF THEM.

2667
01:52:03,483 --> 01:52:05,652
THAT PROPELLED HIM A CERTAIN

2668
01:52:05,652 --> 01:52:09,889
DISTANCE TOWARDS MADNESS.

2669
01:52:09,889 --> 01:52:10,690
BUT THEN HE IS SHOT OUT IN A

2670
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:12,025
WILD AND CRAZY STORM.

2671
01:52:12,025 --> 01:52:15,228
THEN HE MEETS A MAD BEGGAR, AND

2672
01:52:15,228 --> 01:52:17,330
THE SIGHT OF THAT MAD BEGGAR,

2673
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:19,566
POOR TOM, WHO IS EDGAR IN

2674
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:22,602
DISGUISE, SORT OF TAKES IT ALL

2675
01:52:22,602 --> 01:52:23,536
INTO YET ANOTHER DEGREE.

2676
01:52:23,536 --> 01:52:26,740
SUDDENLY HE SEES, THIS IS THE

2677
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:27,206
SOLUTION.

2678
01:52:27,206 --> 01:52:33,012
THIS IS AN ON ACCOMMODATED MAN,

2679
01:52:33,012 --> 01:52:36,850
NO MORE WITH SUCH A BORE -- POOR

2680
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:37,350
BEAR FOUR.

2681
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:38,251
HE IS GOING MAD.

2682
01:52:38,251 --> 01:52:41,321
IT IS TAKING HIM TOWARD -- 

2683
01:52:41,321 --> 01:52:44,757
CHARLIE: AS HE IS GOING MAD, IT

2684
01:52:44,757 --> 01:52:45,657
IS TAKING HIM TO SOME SORT OF --

2685
01:52:45,791 --> 01:52:49,629
JOHN: YEAH, MADNESS IS VISION.

2686
01:52:49,629 --> 01:52:53,599
IT IS CAUTERIZING WOUNDS,

2687
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:54,200
CLEARING HIS BRAIN.

2688
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,635
CHARLIE: WHEN YOU RECITE

2689
01:52:55,635 --> 01:52:58,471
SHAKESPEARE, WHEN YOU SPEAK

2690
01:52:58,471 --> 01:52:59,739
SHAKESPEARE, WHAT DO YOU FEEL? 

2691
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:02,875
JOHN: I AM SO IN TOUCH WITH THE

2692
01:53:02,875 --> 01:53:04,010
GODS OF EXPRESSION.

2693
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:04,844
[LAUGHTER]

2694
01:53:04,844 --> 01:53:08,248
JOHN: I FEEL LIKE IT IS A

2695
01:53:08,248 --> 01:53:09,082
MUSICIAN, SIGHTREADING HARMLESS

2696
01:53:09,082 --> 01:53:13,353
CHAMBER MUSIC.

2697
01:53:13,353 --> 01:53:14,153
A LOT OF SHAKESPEARE IS VERY

2698
01:53:14,153 --> 01:53:17,690
FAMILIAR TO ME BY NOW, SO IT IS

2699
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:19,659
LIKE A LOT OF CLASSICAL MUSIC IS

2700
01:53:19,659 --> 01:53:22,028
FAMILIAR TO MUSICIANS, IT IS

2701
01:53:22,028 --> 01:53:29,002
JUST, I READ THOSE SPEECHES.

2702
01:53:29,002 --> 01:53:31,604
THERE IS THIS INCREDIBLE

2703
01:53:31,604 --> 01:53:32,305
INTERSECTION OF POETRY AND

2704
01:53:32,305 --> 01:53:34,040
EMOTION THAT SHAKESPEARE, TO BE,

2705
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:34,807
HE IS THE VERY BEST EXAMPLE OF

2706
01:53:34,807 --> 01:53:36,142
THAT.

2707
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:39,045
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT PURELY IN

2708
01:53:39,045 --> 01:53:40,413
TERMS OF THE BEAUTY OF THE

2709
01:53:40,413 --> 01:53:41,247
LANGUAGE, OR YOU CAN LOOK AT IT

2710
01:53:41,247 --> 01:53:43,082
IN TERMS OF THE POWER.

2711
01:53:43,082 --> 01:53:45,118
CHARLIE: THE MEANING.

2712
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:48,188
JOHN: AND SHAKESPEARE'S

2713
01:53:48,188 --> 01:53:49,956
EXTRAORDINARY EMPATHY.

2714
01:53:49,956 --> 01:53:50,790
HE MANAGED TO DO THE SAME THING

2715
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:53,960
WITH THE SAME PHRASES, YOU KNOW,

2716
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:55,061
THAT THING I JUST QUOTED YOU.

2717
01:53:55,061 --> 01:53:58,498
CHARLIE: WHERE DO YOU PUT LEAR

2718
01:53:58,498 --> 01:53:59,232
IN ALL OF THE CHARACTERS YOU

2719
01:53:59,232 --> 01:54:00,200
HAVE PLAYED IN SHAKESPEARE? 

2720
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:03,436
JOHN: I ACTUALLY HAVE NOT DONE

2721
01:54:03,436 --> 01:54:03,903
THAT MUCH.

2722
01:54:03,903 --> 01:54:05,070
CHARLIE: HOW MANY HAVE YOU DONE?

2723
01:54:05,271 --> 01:54:11,878
JOHN: I HAVE DONE ABOUT 20

2724
01:54:11,878 --> 01:54:12,712
PLAYS, BUT MOST OF IT WAS BEFORE

2725
01:54:12,712 --> 01:54:13,479
I WAS 20 YEARS OLD AND IN SMALL

2726
01:54:13,479 --> 01:54:13,813
ROLES.

2727
01:54:13,813 --> 01:54:15,815
I DID PLAY MACBETH IN COLLEGE.

2728
01:54:15,815 --> 01:54:18,684
I PLAYED MALVOLIO WITH THE ROYAL

2729
01:54:18,684 --> 01:54:19,485
SHAKESPEARE COMPANY A FEW YEARS

2730
01:54:19,485 --> 01:54:21,220
AGO.

2731
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:21,954
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I

2732
01:54:21,954 --> 01:54:23,189
HAVE TAKEN ON ONE OF THE

2733
01:54:23,189 --> 01:54:24,490
GIGANTIC ROLES.

2734
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:27,527
CHARLIE: IS IT SOMETHING YOU

2735
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:28,194
WISH YOU HAD DONE MORE? 

2736
01:54:28,194 --> 01:54:31,497
JOHN: I STUPIDLY TURNED DOWN

2737
01:54:31,497 --> 01:54:33,499
HAMLET A FEW TIMES.

2738
01:54:33,499 --> 01:54:34,200
I HAD OTHER THINGS TO DO.

2739
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,735
CHARLIE: WAS IT THINGS LIKE

2740
01:54:35,735 --> 01:54:36,536
TELEVISION? 

2741
01:54:36,536 --> 01:54:40,773
JOHN: I THINK IT WAS OTHER PLAYS

2742
01:54:40,773 --> 01:54:41,207
OR -- 

2743
01:54:41,207 --> 01:54:44,977
CHARLIE: THERE IS THIS SORT OF

2744
01:54:44,977 --> 01:54:45,778
THING THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT OF

2745
01:54:45,778 --> 01:54:46,579
THE THEATER THINK -- THAT WOULD

2746
01:54:46,579 --> 01:54:48,781
BE ME -- THAT EVERY ACTOR FEELS

2747
01:54:48,781 --> 01:54:52,418
LIKE IT IS WORTH HIS SOUL, I

2748
01:54:52,418 --> 01:54:53,319
HAVE TO TAKE ON HAMLET.

2749
01:54:53,319 --> 01:54:54,621
YOU DID NOT FEEL THAT? 

2750
01:54:54,621 --> 01:54:57,790
JOHN: I DID NOT HAVE A BURNING

2751
01:54:57,790 --> 01:54:58,725
DESIRE.

2752
01:54:58,725 --> 01:55:02,562
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, TO BE

2753
01:55:02,562 --> 01:55:03,362
HONEST, WHAT I LIKE WORKING ON

2754
01:55:03,362 --> 01:55:04,530
MOST IS NEW MATERIAL.

2755
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:06,566
I LOVE WORKING WITH WRITERS AND

2756
01:55:06,566 --> 01:55:07,667
CREATING SOMETHING THAT NOBODY

2757
01:55:07,667 --> 01:55:08,668

CAN HE GET TO ROMNEY LEVELS?

2802
02:01:14,166 --> 02:01:14,867

2804
02:01:15,668 --> 02:01:16,302

THING.

THE THINGS THAT THEY ARE ALSO

02:01:26,479 --> 02:01:31,550

02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:33,419
WORK TO HIS FAVOR.

2811
02:01:33,419 --> 02:01:35,521

AUDIENCES AND TALKED ABOUT BLACK

2821
02:01:59,378 --> 02:02:00,613
VOTERS IN CONDESCENDING WAYS.

2822
02:02:00,613 --> 02:02:04,250
SOME SAID THAT THE FIRST THING

2823
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:05,718
THAT HE HAD TO DO WAS TALK TO

2824
02:02:05,718 --> 02:02:07,753
BLACK AUDIENCES AND YOU SHOULD

2825
02:02:07,753 --> 02:02:08,387
GIVE HIM CREDIT.

2826
02:02:08,387 --> 02:02:13,793
THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST MAFIC

2827
02:02:13,793 --> 02:02:15,928
-- MOST AFRICAN-AMERICANS KNOW

2828
02:02:15,928 --> 02:02:17,830
THAT HE SPENT HALF THE OBAMA

2829
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:20,533
ADMINISTRATION AS ATTACKING

2830
02:02:20,533 --> 02:02:24,770
OBAMA AS ILLEGITIMATE AND, FOR

2831
02:02:24,770 --> 02:02:26,238
MOST AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT I

2832
02:02:26,238 --> 02:02:27,039
KNOW AND FOR MANY ACROSS THE

2833
02:02:27,039 --> 02:02:30,076
COUNTRY, IT HAS PUT THEM OUT OF

2834
02:02:30,076 --> 02:02:33,913
REACH FOR DONALD TRUMP FOREVER.

2835
02:02:33,913 --> 02:02:36,215
THEY REGARD THAT AS RACIST.

2836
02:02:36,215 --> 02:02:41,120
>> DONALD TRUMP PURSUED THIS

2837
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:43,756
WITH A VEHEMENCE THAT WAS CRUEL

2838
02:02:43,756 --> 02:02:50,162
AND STUPID, IN RETROSPECT.

2839
02:02:50,162 --> 02:02:54,833
>> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS A NEW

2840
02:02:54,833 --> 02:02:57,336
NICKNAME FOR HILLARY.

2841
02:02:57,336 --> 02:03:03,476
"HIDING HILLARY." 

2842
02:03:03,476 --> 02:03:08,213
TODAY, THE 260TH DAY, THERE WERE

2843
02:03:08,213 --> 02:03:11,216
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CLINTON

2844
02:03:11,216 --> 02:03:12,017
FOUNDATION AND THE CLINTON TEAM

2845
02:03:12,017 --> 02:03:14,553
HAS RESPONDED TO CALLS FOR PRESS

2846
02:03:14,553 --> 02:03:17,389
ACCESS BY SAYING THAT SHE HAS

2847
02:03:17,389 --> 02:03:20,593
GIVEN INTERVIEWS WITH 2600

2848
02:03:20,593 --> 02:03:24,263
QUESTIONS IN 2016.

2849
02:03:24,263 --> 02:03:26,398
WHILE WE ARE ON THE TOPIC OF THE

2850
02:03:26,398 --> 02:03:28,601
CLINTONS AND THE PRESS, THERE

2851
02:03:28,601 --> 02:03:34,373
WAS A PLANE THAT WAS SEPARATE

2852
02:03:34,373 --> 02:03:35,641
FROM THE PRESS CORPS.

2853
02:03:35,641 --> 02:03:39,678
IN THE 1960'S, THE PRESS

2854
02:03:39,678 --> 02:03:42,314
TRAVELED ON THE CANDIDATES'

2855
02:03:42,314 --> 02:03:43,816
PLANES.

2856
02:03:43,816 --> 02:03:46,719
THERE HAVE BEEN DISAGREEMENTS

2857
02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:49,688
ABOUT WHETHER PRESS CONFERENCES

2858
02:03:49,688 --> 02:03:51,690
ARE A THING OF THE PAST IN THE

2859
02:03:51,690 --> 02:03:53,592
DIGITAL AGE.

2860
02:03:53,592 --> 02:03:55,628
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT

2861
02:03:55,628 --> 02:03:58,030
THE ONLY REASON YOU CARE ABOUT

2862
02:03:58,030 --> 02:04:01,000
THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE PRESS.

2863
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,503
SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE TRUE

2864
02:04:04,503 --> 02:04:08,574
AND WE DO HAVE THE ELEMENTS OF

2865
02:04:08,574 --> 02:04:10,075
THE GRANDSTANDING REPORTERS.

2866
02:04:10,075 --> 02:04:13,078
ONE OF THEM, YOU SEE RIGHT HERE.

2867
02:04:13,078 --> 02:04:17,349
>> WHERE?

2868
02:04:17,349 --> 02:04:21,220
>> BEHIND YOU.

2869
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:24,423
HILLARY CLINTON HAS A SITUATION

2870
02:04:24,423 --> 02:04:25,257
WHERE SHE HAS TO ADDRESS PEOPLE

2871
02:04:25,257 --> 02:04:26,992
WITH REGULARITY AND SHE DOES NOT

2872
02:04:26,992 --> 02:04:29,194
HAVE CONTROLS OR CONSTRAINTS

2873
02:04:29,194 --> 02:04:30,196
OVER THE INTERVIEW.

2874
02:04:30,196 --> 02:04:33,065
IT IS DIFFERENT THAN A

2875
02:04:33,065 --> 02:04:34,266
ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEW.

2876
02:04:34,266 --> 02:04:36,935
IT IS A FREE-FLOWING THING AND

2877
02:04:36,935 --> 02:04:39,405
SHE IS QUESTIONED BY PEOPLE WHO

2878
02:04:39,405 --> 02:04:40,372
KNOW HER BEST.

2879
02:04:40,372 --> 02:04:45,211
BOTH CANDIDATES SHOULD DO THIS.

2880
02:04:45,211 --> 02:04:47,446
>> I AGREE WITH YOU, ALMOST

2881
02:04:47,446 --> 02:04:47,913
COMPLETELY.

2882
02:04:47,913 --> 02:04:48,681
THE PRINCIPAL REASON FOR A PRESS

2883
02:04:48,681 --> 02:04:52,017
CONFERENCE HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH

2884
02:04:52,017 --> 02:04:54,620
THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE.

2885
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:55,487
IF YOU ARE SITTING AT HOME AND

2886
02:04:55,487 --> 02:04:58,924
WATCHING THIS PROGRAM, YOU WANT

2887
02:04:58,924 --> 02:05:04,663
TO KNOW WHAT HILLARY CLINTON IS

2888
02:05:04,663 --> 02:05:07,533
GOING TO DO ABOUT SYRIA AND

2889
02:05:07,533 --> 02:05:09,468
ALEPPO.

2890
02:05:09,468 --> 02:05:12,037
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN AND AROUND

2891
02:05:12,037 --> 02:05:15,474
THE GLOBE IN THESE SITUATIONS?

2892
02:05:15,474 --> 02:05:17,476
YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT.

2893
02:05:17,476 --> 02:05:22,715
>> THE LOGICAL EXTENSION OF THIS

2894
02:05:22,715 --> 02:05:23,482
IS, SHE HAS NOT BEEN ASKED

2895
02:05:23,482 --> 02:05:26,452
QUESTIONS VERY OFTEN AND THERE

2896
02:05:26,452 --> 02:05:29,755
ARE BETTER CHANCES OF HER

2897
02:05:29,755 --> 02:05:30,556
GETTING THESE QUESTIONS, IF SHE

2898
02:05:30,556 --> 02:05:32,525
MEETS THE PRESS.

2899
02:05:32,525 --> 02:05:36,695
DONALD TRUMP CALLED ON HILLARY

2900
02:05:36,695 --> 02:05:42,701
CLINTON TO RELEASE RECORDS.

2901
02:05:42,701 --> 02:05:44,670
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN RESPONDED

2902
02:05:44,670 --> 02:05:46,505
AND THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVE

2903
02:05:46,505 --> 02:05:48,674
RELEASED MORE INFORMATION AND

2904
02:05:48,674 --> 02:05:56,849
THAT "HEALTH" HAS BEEN AN

2905
02:05:56,849 --> 02:05:59,485
ADJECTIVE-LADEN LETTER FROM HIS

2906
02:05:59,485 --> 02:05:59,918
PHYSICIAN.

2907
02:05:59,918 --> 02:06:04,590
LISTEN TO HIS DOCTOR DESCRIBE

2908
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:07,659
WRITING THE LETTER.

2909
02:06:07,659 --> 02:06:09,728
>> I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ALL DAY

2910
02:06:09,728 --> 02:06:15,034
AND I GET RUSHED AND I WAS

2911
02:06:15,034 --> 02:06:16,936
ANXIOUS.

2912
02:06:16,936 --> 02:06:21,040
I TRIED TO GET IT DOWN.

2913
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,609
>> I THINK SOME OF THE WORDS DID

2914
02:06:23,609 --> 02:06:28,047
NOT COME OUT EXACTLY AS PLANNED.

2915
02:06:28,047 --> 02:06:31,050
>> YOU THINK HE IS THE BEST.

2916
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:33,685
IT WORKS OUT JUST FINE.

2917
02:06:33,685 --> 02:06:36,155
>> THERE ARE ARGUMENTS ABOUT

2918
02:06:36,155 --> 02:06:36,655
TRANSPARENCY.

2919
02:06:36,655 --> 02:06:41,226
ON THE QUESTION OF HEALTH.

2920
02:06:41,226 --> 02:06:45,097
TRUMP IS GOING ON OFFENSE.

2921
02:06:45,097 --> 02:06:47,299
WHO HAS THE UPPER HAND?

2922
02:06:47,299 --> 02:06:52,204
>> YOU JUST SAW WILLIE NELSON AS

2923
02:06:52,204 --> 02:06:52,671
A DOCTOR.

2924
02:06:52,671 --> 02:06:53,405
>> THAT WAS WILLIE NELSON AND

2925
02:06:53,405 --> 02:06:54,173
THE DUDE FROM THE LEBOWSKI.

2926
02:06:54,173 --> 02:06:59,211
>> I DO MY OWN GROCERY SHOPPING

2927
02:06:59,211 --> 02:07:00,212
AND I MEET ORDINARY PEOPLE.

2928
02:07:00,212 --> 02:07:04,383
THIS CAMPAIGN IS SCARY, WITHOUT

2929
02:07:04,383 --> 02:07:06,518
PONDERING THESE HEALTH

2930
02:07:06,518 --> 02:07:07,419
STATEMENTS.

2931
02:07:07,419 --> 02:07:12,825
WE HAVE TO KNOW THEIR PHYSICAL

2932
02:07:12,825 --> 02:07:13,225
HEALTH.

2933
02:07:13,225 --> 02:07:13,992
THE MENTAL HEALTH IS ON EXHIBIT

2934
02:07:13,992 --> 02:07:15,628
EVERY DAY.

2935
02:07:15,628 --> 02:07:17,563
DONALD IS LOSING.

2936
02:07:17,563 --> 02:07:22,501
>> I FIND IT TROUBLING.

2937
02:07:22,501 --> 02:07:25,804
HILLARY CLINTON COULD TURN

2938
02:07:25,804 --> 02:07:26,672
AROUND AND SAY THAT SHE IS HAPPY

2939
02:07:26,672 --> 02:07:32,911
TO RELEASE THESE.

2940
02:07:32,911 --> 02:07:34,146
BUT IT IS TRUE.

2941
02:07:34,146 --> 02:07:35,147
HILLARY HAS RELEASED MORE THAN

2942
02:07:35,147 --> 02:07:40,319
HE HAS, AND THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

2943
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:41,153
MIKE: WAS THAT A REAL DOCTOR?

2944
02:07:41,153 --> 02:07:43,355

ACCORDING TO THAT MAN, THE

2948
02:07:49,194 --> 02:07:50,195
HEALTHIEST MAN TO ENTER THE

2949
02:07:50,195 --> 02:07:59,304
OFFICE OF PRESIDENT FOREVER.

2950
02:07:59,304 --> 02:08:01,306
MIKE: IT IS NO WONDER THAT I

2951
02:08:01,306 --> 02:08:02,307
ALSO AGREE WITH YOUR INSTINCT,

2952
02:08:02,307 --> 02:08:05,210
HAVING SEEN THAT DR. AND THIS

2953
02:08:05,210 --> 02:08:06,278

2955
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:09,181
THIS BACK AND FORTH HAS BECOME

2956
02:08:09,181 --> 02:08:15,654

2957
02:08:15,654 --> 02:08:16,455
JOHN: LUDICROUS, EVEN THAT WE

2958
02:08:16,455 --> 02:08:17,322
ARE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION IS

2959
02:08:17,322 --> 02:08:18,457
KIND OF CRAZY.

2960
02:08:18,457 --> 02:08:19,491
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT

2961
02:08:19,491 --> 02:08:23,495
DOCTOR? WOULD YOU LET THAT GUY

2962
02:08:23,495 --> 02:08:27,599
TREAT YOU?

2963
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:28,433
MIKE: HE HAS BEEN MY POSITION

2964
02:08:28,433 --> 02:08:29,434
FOR MANY YEARS.

2965
02:08:29,434 --> 02:08:30,535
LOOK AT ME.

2966
02:08:30,535 --> 02:08:31,603
I AM THE PICTURE OF HEALTH.

2967
02:08:31,603 --> 02:08:32,604
AND A HILLARY CLINTON WORKER HAS

2968
02:08:32,604 --> 02:08:33,472
ANNOUNCED SHE IS SEPARATING FROM

2969
02:08:33,472 --> 02:08:38,777
ANTHONY WEINER.

2970
02:08:38,777 --> 02:08:39,645
NORMALLY, THIS WOULD NOT WARRANT

2971
02:08:39,645 --> 02:08:40,679
OUR ATTENTION ON THE SHOW, BUT

2972
02:08:40,679 --> 02:08:41,713

JOHN, DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO

2978
02:08:54,693 --> 02:09:00,732
WORK THIS INTO THE NEWS.

2979
02:09:00,732 --> 02:09:01,700
DOES THIS HAVE ANY POLITICAL

2980
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:04,703
RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER?

2981
02:09:04,703 --> 02:09:09,942
JOHN: NO.

2982
02:09:09,942 --> 02:09:10,976

PRESIDENT SHOULD BE, AND IT DOES

2987
02:09:17,916 --> 02:09:20,018
NOT MATTER.

2988
02:09:20,018 --> 02:09:21,053
