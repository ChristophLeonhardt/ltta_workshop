Trump is a guy who promises a lot but
you might have noticed he's got a way of
saying the same two words every time he
makes his biggest hugest promises
believe me it's going to be great
believe me we're going to build a wall
and make Mexico pay for it believe me
we're going to destroy Isis so fast
believe me there's nothing suspicious in
my tax returns believe me
by the way does anybody in this massive
auditorium believe that Donald Trump's
been paying his fair share of taxes
you
