heavy rain the story so far
I'm the origami killer I get my victims
into my car I drowned them in rainwater
and I dumped them on a wasteland with an
origami figure in one hand and orchid on
the chest I do that because I'm bored
mr. Shelby and it's a creative and
entertaining way of having fun
is that good enough for you do you want
more
you have no business investigating my
son I told you he had nothing to do with
it all due respect mr. Kramer it's up to
me to decide who I want to invest it
yeah dawned on me and my son mr. Schue
if you do you'll regret Ethan Mars has
had psychological problems since his
first son died feels responsible for his
death after one of our usual sessions I
found this on the floor you're a snake

an origami figure they think it's me
you're all over the news reports Ethan
they say you're the origami killer oh my
god is it true no it's not true are you

self is testing and testing my love for
Sean he wants to know if I love my son
enough to save him that's mad that means
there's some part of me that knows where
Sean is but the only way to find him is
to go through these trials wait what's a
man that man over there

just go alright so we now know who owns
the apartment John Sheppard it's so now
okay in scale bit so Scott Shelby knows
that it's John Sheppard's the killer and
now Madison knows that John Sheppard's

bloody cry is like a fight scene the
suspect dead someone tries to kill me
I'm the right track do you think yes he
I'm sorry killer killer are you giving
the option yes I know it could have
killed you

glasses okay okay and this will tell me
how to be a detective
okay put on my glasses okay I would put
it on my forehead okay now we all find
clothes yes look at all the clothes
these aree glasses is like detective a
simulator
oh my goodness look at all these clothes
okay well this is this is always the
boring bit so I don't know if I will
show you okay I think this is actually
this actually might be interesting I
might find some interesting clues let's
first check out the lamp Madison page
what was the journalist doing here
journalist she is a journalist I knew
she was a journalist but they've got
Madison pages finger prints at this
crime scene
okay another suspect to go on maybe
normal Jaden's gonna meet Madison a gun
is his Paco's gun oh wait no it's my gun
oh shit so look a Paco a bullet right
between the eyes
oh shit instant rest in peace Paco I
mean I know he's a father and everything
but I don't think it is up to die or
maybe he did I don't know but still
Paco Mendez was no saint his rap sheet
reads like the telephone book wait
really he's a criminal
oh yeah he said that the he said that
the origami killer got him out of jail
how the hell how I was looking for
something hmm
he was looking for something hmm
this is a bullet casing oh this might
help 45 caliber now we know what gun
that the thing he used weight that had
gone here 45 caliber semi-automatic is
the killer's gun
no I think it's Madison's gun where is
it I don't even know our shit there's
pollen in the air kid pheromones the
fucking Origami Killer
all right language all right so there's
pollen in the air okay I think that's
everything guys okay so we have Madison
Paige as a witness we have the killer's
gun we have the killer's name John okay
I think that's enough I think I think
that's everything
I don't know ah shit oh-ho but I don't
think I miss anything I miss anything
ah shit trip - oh shit don't think about
drugs now oh my goodness the video I'm
Norman Jamie is a bloody druggie I like
it when oh but he's a bloody druggie
shit he's taking something called
Triplicane very disgusting oh shit what
is this point if he's sucking going on
the left on the right what this is shit
okay
that was intense this club scene okay so
now everyone is now catching on all
right I want to know what Ethan what's
happening with Ethan away from we're
going to even speak of the devil okay
Ethan's here now the last thing Ethan
did was he shot an innocent man he's
done four trials okay and I think
there's one more yeah I think there's
one more Ethan you okay
ah Ethan always crying he shot that guy
he's sad about it
I can't imagine myself psychologically
psicological torment killing someone are
you alright Madison's back hey I killed
a man
I had no choice I had no choice
you're not the origami killer even so
you're not responsible for those murders
I can prove it
oh shit yeah she can that changes
nothing
savings Shawn is all that matters now oh
so cute
wait what kissy what oh shit
is it oh shit we're gonna kiss guys oh
shit oh okay okay okay okay oh I know I
know a lot of you guys are wanting me to
kiss her okay and I don't like I know
what's gonna happen next
there's gonna be like a huge sex scene
and I don't think I want to do that now
because I'm scared that the video might
get taken down so I'm gonna choose not
to have sex and not to kiss her because
I'm scared so I'm gonna say leave a like
and if this video gets 20,000 likes I
might do it later on okay maybe once the
series is finished I'm gonna do a video
showing like alternative endings to
levels and this might be the first thing
so yeah I'm sorry guys but I really feel
like I can't I can't share this like if
this video gets taken down or gets aid
restricted it's gonna ruin the whole
series okay so I'm sorry but I'll do it
later if this video reaches 20,000 likes

guardian
Gordon is my son
no one will miss him watch but what that
boy Gordy killed no one I'll miss him
the street trash like so many others you
disgusting pile of shoes piece of shit
kill him what about John Shepard yeah
why did you put flowers on it I I owned
the construction site where he died
oh I never forgot I've been putting
flowers on his grave for 30 years
John had a twin brother what happened to
him I don't know he was adopted I think
his mother his mother should know his
mother name is Anne and Shepard wall
what are you doing oh my god oh my god
he's having a hard time
quickly I need my pills
oh my god Metro air god
should we kill it guys I don't know he's
just a father he's just a father I don't
think he deserves to die though I don't
want to kill him but I know you guys
yeah I know you guys want him to die you
know but I don't think it's right you
know it's more interesting to see him
dead though guys I don't know what to do
okay I've put some thought into it
because I've killed so many people the
police might realize that I killed all
those bodyguards
so it's he's the only guy who knows it
was me so I think I need to let him die
leave Shelby come back party you come
back
shit maybe I'll redo it in a future
episode guys
holy shit anyway guys I'm gonna end the
video here we are wrapping up guys we're
not I'm thinking like maybe two three
max videos left like we're gonna find
out who's the killer hopefully next
episode 10,000 15,000 likes all of the
next episode 20,000 like and I will do a
next episode once the series is finished
and show Madison and Ethan having the
sexy because the bad video gets
age-restricted or take him down I won't
mind because it won't ruin the story

didn't do it and I will show it if this
video reaches 20,000 lines and I'm
pretty sure you guys will do it cuz
you're a bunch of pervs like me anyway
