>> HISTORY MADE OVERNIGHT AS
DONALD TRUMP WELCOMES NEWLY
FREED AMERICAN HOSTAGES FROM
NORTH KOREA, FOREIGN POLICY
ANALYST SKINNER.
AND THANKS FOR BEING HERE ON A
HISTORIC MORNING.
WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER AND
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, IT WILL BE
DEBRIEFED.
WHAT DO WE EXPECT TO LEARN?
>> AN IMPORTANT ASSET.
LET ME SAY IS YOU WILL HEAR
THROUGH THE DAY, A HISTORIC
MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES AND
THE WORLD, FAMILIES OF THOSE
HELD, FREED AMERICANS AND FOR
THEM AS WELL.
WITH THAT SAID, INCREDIBLE HUMAN
INTELLIGENCE ASSETS FOR THE
UNITED STATES AS THE WHITE HOUSE
PREPARES FOR THE SUMMIT WITH KIM
JONG UN.
WE DON'T HAVE THE QUALITY AND
QUANTITY OF ON THE GROUND
INTELLIGENCE IN NORTH KOREA THAT
WE HAVE IN OTHER NATIONS DUE TO
COUNTRY OVER MANY DECADES.
THERE IS A LOT WE DON'T KNOW.
WHAT THESE FORMER HOSTAGES CAN
TELL US IS THEIR IMPRESSION OF
THE STATE OF THE POLITICAL
CULTURE IN NORTH KOREA, WHAT
NORTH KOREANS ARE SAYING, WHAT
THEY THINK ABOUT THEIR
GOVERNMENT, HOW THE GOVERNMENT
INTERACTS IN SUBTLE WAYS WE
CAN'T PERCEIVE.
THAT WILL BE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE
INFORMATION AS THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION CRAFTS ITS
TALKS.
TODD: YOU SAID THIS COULD BE
DONALD TRUMP'S REAGAN MOMENT WAS
WHAT YOU MEAN?
>> THE FINAL DECADE OF THE COLD
WAR WAS AN INCREDIBLY TENSE. GO,
THERE WERE CONCERNS NUCLEAR WAR
MIGHT HAPPEN, THE US PLACED
INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR FORCES IN
EUROPE AT THE END OF 1983 BUT
EARLIER THAT YEAR THE UNITED
STATES WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE
SOVIET UNION.
REAGAN AND THE GENERAL SECRETARY
TO GET THE RELEASE OF TWO SOVIET
PENTECOSTAL FAMILIES WHO LIVED
IN THE BASEMENT OF THE US
EMBASSY IN MOSCOW FOR ALMOST 5
YEARS AND THAT WAS QUIETLY DONE.
IT WASN'T REVEALED UNTIL 1990
AFTER THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION.
IT PREFIGURED DISARMAMENT TALKS
THAT CAME LATER.
WITHOUT HUMAN RIGHTS
INTERVENTION I DON'T THINK WE
WOULD HAVE HAD A END TO THE COLD
WAR.
TODD: PRES. OBAMA NEGOTIATED THE
RELEASE OF BOWE BERGDAHL, GAVE
UP A LOT TO GET HIM BACK.
WE DON'T KNOW THE PARTICULARS OF
THIS RELEASE AND THIS
NEGOTIATION BUT DOESN'T SEEM
DONALD TRUMP GAVE UP A LOT, THIS
WAS A BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR THE
TALKS IN JUNE.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND?
>> YOU HAVE IT RIGHT.
I DON'T HAVE ANY INSIDE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE
DISCUSSIONS BEHIND THE SCENES TO
SECURE THEIR RELEASE BUT IT DOES
APPEAR THAT THIS IS SOMETHING OF
A PRECONDITION FOR THE LARGER
TALKS THAT WILL TAKE PLACE BUT
IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE ESSENCE
OF DIPLOMACY.
DIPLOMACY HAPPENS THROUGH A
SERIES OF MOVES AND THE
POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IS CENTRAL
TO GETTING A TECHNOLOGY
NEGOTIATION FORWARD.
THE DISARMAMENT TALKS ARE ABOUT
DISMANTLING THE TECHNOLOGY
PROBLEM
DISMANTLING THE TECHNOLOGY
PROBLEM OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND
ICBMs IN NORTH KOREA BUT IT IS
NOT THE REAL PROBLEM WITH NORTH
KOREA.
IT IS AN ISOLATED DICTATORSHIP
THAT OPPRESSES PEOPLE AND THAT
