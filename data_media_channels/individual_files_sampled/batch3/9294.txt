TIMES SINCE 2,013. BACK HERE IN THE U.S., AT AMERICAN ELECTION HEADQUARTERS, REPUBLICANS BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF IN WEST VIRGINIA. THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORT TO BLOCK A REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE IN THAT STATE SUCCEEDED LAST NIGHT. CORRESPONDENT PETER DOOCY HAS THAT STORY AND A ROUND UP OF THE EVENING'S OTHER ELECTIONS FROM WEST VIRGINIA. Reporter: THE SO-CALLED SWAMP WAS NEARLY SWEPT LAST NIGHT. I WAS TAUGHT MY WHOLE LIFE, NO EXCUSES. ELECTORATES DENIED THREE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THEIR BIDS FOR OFFICE AND ONE REPUBLICAN NUMBER THAT CHAMP TO RUN FOR REELECTION. BUT MITCH McCONNELL IS HAPPY BECAUSE WEST VIRGINIA DON BLANKENSHIP, THE CANDIDATE IS ALICE SURE COULDN'T WIN IN NOVEMBER WHO COINED THE NAME IT, COCAINE MITCH, CAME IN THIRD. THE MAJORITY WINNER LOADED WITH A PARODY OF THE SHOW NARCO'S. I'M GLAD THE PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA DECIDED THAT TICKLER APPROACH OF ATTACKING ME AND MY FAMILY WAS GOOD FOR A DISTANT THIRD PLACE. BUT McCONNELL ISN'T THE ONE WEST VIRGINIA'S WINNER IS THINKING. MR. PRESIDENT, IF YOU ARE WATCHING RIGHT NOW, LET ME TELL YOU, YOUR TWEET WAS HUGE. IT WASN'T HUGE FOR HOUSE MEMBERS. CONGRESSMAN EVAN JENKINS WAS A RUNNER-UP FOR WEST VIRGINIA, AND CONGRESSMAN LUCA METZLER AND TODD WERE KILLED WERE CASUALTIES IN INDIANA WHERE A LESSER-KNOWN BUSINESSMAN, MICRON, WILL CHALLENGE INCUMBENT SENATOR JOE CONNELLY WITH A CAMPAIGN MODELED ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S. WHEN I SIGN. I FEEL BACK IN 16, I THOUGHT, MAYBE WE CAN GET MORE OF US IN THE SENATE. A TRUMP LIKE CONGRESS WAS HELPING THE ONLY G.O.P. HOUSE MEMBER TO ADVANCE AND HE NOW FACES DEMOCRATIC SENATOR SHERROD BROWN. MAKE OHIO FIRST AGAIN AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AHEAD. RICHARD CORDRAY, AND A FAVORITE OF SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN EASILY BEAT DENNIS KUCINICH FOR A CHANCE TO SUCCEED JOHN KASICH. YOU DEMANDED A CHANGE AND WE HEARD YOU, WE WANT THE SAME. SPEAK OUT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CALIFORNIA'S UPCOMING PRIMARY WHERE DIANNE FEINSTEIN FAILED TO SECURE HER PARTY'S ENDORSEMENT IN AN AGGRESSIVE CHALLENGE FROM STATE SENATOR KEVIN DE LEON, THE FIELD IS MOSTLY SET, SO THEY ARE PRESERVING RESOURCES TO BASE A ROSTER OF REPUBLICANS STILL BEING FILLED IN. EVERY CANDIDATE THAT WE WANTED, ONE. REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HAD BEEN COMPETING TO BE MOST LIKE TRUMP. NOW THEY ARE COMPETING FOR SPOTS ON HIS CALENDAR AND THEY ALL THINK A TRUMP RALLY IN A STATE
