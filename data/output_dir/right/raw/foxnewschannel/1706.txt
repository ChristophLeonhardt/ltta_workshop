1
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,013
>> Tucker: A POLITICIAN'S JOB

2
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:12,614
IS TO APPEAL TO VOTERS.

3
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:13,314
IT LEFT LEANING VOTERS DON'T

4
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:14,315
LIKE THE NRA.

5
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:15,683
PAT DAVIS IS A DEMOCRAT RUNNING

6
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,519
FOR CONGRESS IN NEW MEXICO.

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,419
PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AND

8
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:19,721
DAVIS HAS PRODUCED A NEW AD

9
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:22,290
WHERE HE EXPRESSES HIS VIEW OF

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,759
THE NRA UNAMBIGUOUSLY, BUT YOU

11
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:27,295
DECIDE.

12
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:28,663
>> [BLEEP] THE NRA.

13
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:29,764
THEIR PROGRAM POLICIES HAVE

14
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:32,066
RESULTED IN DEAD CHILDREN, DEAD

15
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:32,700
MOTHERS AND DEAD FATHERS.

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,070
I'M PAT DAVIS AND I APPROVED

17
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:36,838
THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE IF CONGRESS

18
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:38,139
WON'T CHANGE OUR GUN LAWS, WE

19
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:42,110
ARE CHANGING CONGRESS.

20
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,078
>> Tucker: PAT DAVIS JOINS US

21
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,113
TONIGHT FROM NEW MEXICO.

22
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:45,980
THANKS FOR COMING ON.

23
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,515
>> HI, TUCKER.

24
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:51,486
>> Tucker: THAT'S THE AD?

25
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:53,054
KIND OF MORONIC, NO?

26
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,556
>> THAT'S IT, JUST 15 SECONDS,

27
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:56,257
BUT IT GOT A WHOLE LOT OF

28
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:58,193
ATTENTION AND STARTED A NEW

29
00:00:58,193 --> 00:00:59,060
CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS AND I'M

30
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,861
GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

31
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:01,129
>> Tucker: DOESN'T IT DEGRADE

32
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:01,396
YOU?

33
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,666
YOU USE THE F WORD IN THE AD.

34
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:10,171
YOU HAVE A POSITION STATED, BUT

35
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:11,005
>> BEING THE LIGHT HASN'T MADE

36
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:12,840
OUR SCHOOLS IN HIS FAVOR.

37
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,775
IT HASN'T PROTECTED POLICE

38
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:16,644
OFFICERS LIKE I USED TO BE.

39
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,213
IF A CUSS WORD ON TV OFFENDS YOU

40
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:21,316
MORE THAN DEAD CHILDREN IN

41
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:22,016
PARKLAND OR NEWTOWN THEN YOUR

42
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:23,751
PRIORITIES ARE WRONG.

43
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,054
>> Tucker: IT'S NOT EITHER/OR.

44
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:28,890
I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE A COP OR

45
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,691
NOT.

46
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:30,625
IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR.

47
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,661
IT'S NOT THAT I'M SO OFFENDED.

48
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,897
DO YOU THINK RUDENESS WILL?

49
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:37,298
IS RUDENESS GOING TO SAVE LIVES

50
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,266
DO YOU THINK?

51
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,267
>> AS WE WERE LOOKING TO MAKE

52
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:42,170
THIS AD, WHAT WE SAID -- WE KEPT

53
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,305
COMING UP WITH THE SAME IDEA AND

54
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:46,341
EVERY ADD, THIS ISSUE LOOKED

55
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:47,041
LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE'S AND THOSE

56
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,477
HAD NOT WORKED.

57
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:50,712
CLEARLY THIS GOT THE NRA'S

58
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:52,547
ATTENTION AND IT HAS STARTED THE

59
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:53,915
NEW CONVERSATION BOTH AMONGST

60
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:54,916
CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR OFFICE

61
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:58,119
ABOUT WHO -- HOW WE ORGANIZE AND

62
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,687
TAKE BACK CONGRESS AND PUT THE

63
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:00,722
LEADERS THERE AND TAKE BACK ON

64
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:01,289
CONTROL.

65
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,258
AND ALSO HOW WE STAND UP TO THE

66
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:03,858
NRA.

67
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,928
WE KNOW WHAT WORKS.

68
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,263
50% OF NRA MEMBERS SUPPORT --

69
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:09,464
>> Tucker: A CONVERSATION

70
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:10,264
ABOUT HOW EMBARRASSING YOU ARE.

71
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,100
HOW MANY NRA MEMBERS HAVE

72
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,470
COMMITTED MASS SHOOTINGS?

73
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,371
>> TUCKER, HERE'S THE THING.

74
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:19,040
A MAJORITY OF AMERICA'S -- 89%

75
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,478
OF POLICE OFFICERS, A MAJORITY

76
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:24,045
OF NRA KNOW THERE ARE

77
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:26,848
COMMON SENSE THINGS WE CAN DO.

78
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:27,548
>> Tucker: YOU JUST RELEASED

79
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,785
AN AD THAT SAID F THE NRA WHICH

80
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:32,654
I'M SURE BACK AT YOUR FRATERNITY

81
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:33,121
HOUSE THEY LOVE.

82
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,290
BUT LET ME ASK YOU ONE ADULT

83
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,991
QUESTION, HOW MANY NRA MEMBERS

84
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,060
HAVE COMMITTED MASS SHOOTINGS?

85
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,895
>> TUCKER, THIS IS ABOUT THE

86
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:41,796
ORGANIZATION ITSELF.

87
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:43,164
MY FAMILY GREW UP --

88
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,265
>> Tucker: I'M ASKING YOU

89
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,266
ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF.

90
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:49,871
>> IT'S NOT THE NRA THAT MY DAD

91
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:50,305
ORGANIZATION.

92
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:51,506
>> Tucker: HOW MANY OF THEIR

93
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:53,441
MEMBERS -- THEY HAVE MILLIONS OF

94
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:53,775
MEMBERS.

95
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:58,046
HOW MANY OF THEM --

96
00:02:58,046 --> 00:02:58,913
>> I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM THEM

97
00:02:58,913 --> 00:02:59,514
ALL WEEK.

98
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:01,282
I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM THEM ALL

99
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:01,883
WEEK.

100
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:04,319
THE NRA MADE US THEIR TARGET.

101
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,320
WE STARTED A NEW CONVERSATION

102
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,221
AND WHAT I'VE ALSO HEARD FROM

103
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,123
OUR PARENTS IN HYDE PARK WHEN,

104
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:09,791
IN VIRGINIA AND NEWTOWN WHO

105
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,492
DONATED TO KEEP THE OUT ON THE

106
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,027
AIR BECAUSE THEY WANT PEOPLE IN

107
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:15,163
CONGRESS TO FINALLY STEP UP.

108
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:18,066
IF THE NRA WANTS TO COME TO THE

109
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,267
TABLE AND HELP US PASS

110
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,601
COMMON SENSE REGULATIONS THAT

111
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,770
THEIR MEMBER SUPPORT, LET'S DO

112
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,304
IT.

113
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:24,806
WE ARE NOT WAITING ON THEM TO

114
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:25,506
COME TO THE TABLE.

115
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:26,941
>> Tucker: TRYING TO HAVE AN

116
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:27,475

HERE IS YOUR NEW SPOT.

118
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,278
I WANT TO TALK THE POLICY AND

HERE'S YOUR LATEST 152ND AD.

121
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:36,484
>> BY THE TIME THIS AD IS DONE

122
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:39,687
IN AR-15 COULD HAVE FIRED 150

123
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:40,121
BULLETS.

124
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,689
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO BAN

125
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,091
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

126
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:44,125

MESSAGE BECAUSE LIVES ARE MORE

129
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,264
IMPORTANT THAN GUN COMPANY

130
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:50,598
PROFITS.

131
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,166

132
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:56,270
THAT IN 15 SECONDS AND AR-15 CAN

133
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,071
FIRE 150 ROUNDS.

134
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:57,505
IS THAT TRUE?

135
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:00,708
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

136
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,276
YOU GET IT RIGHT HERE IN

137
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:02,677

RIGHT HERE IN NEW MEXICO YOU CAN

00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,881
GO TO A PARKING LOT OR GO ON THE

00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,586
AND AR-15 AND BY A LEGALLY

142
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:12,487

REPLICATE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED

145
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,524
IN LAS VEGAS.

146
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:19,260
THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTER 600 ROUNDS

147
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,627
A MINUTE.

148
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:23,431
>> Tucker: YOU ARE SAYING AND

149
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:28,903
AR-15 CAN SHOOT 150 ROUNDS IN 15

150
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:29,670
SECONDS.

151
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,838
LET ME ASK, LET'S BE SPECIFIC.

152
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,106

156
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,646
>> EXACTLY LIKE THE MAGAZINES

157
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:40,081
THAT LAS VEGAS POLICE OFFICERS

158
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:41,149
PULLED OUT OF THAT HOTEL ROOM.

159
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:44,085

00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:44,419
ROUND --

161
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:48,289
>> 50 AND 100 ROUND MAGAZINE.

162
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,690
>> Tucker: IT'S NOT.

163
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,691
THESE ARE RHETORICAL QUESTIONS.

164
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:51,893
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

165
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:52,326
TALKING ABOUT.

166
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,729
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A POLICE

167
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,063
OFFICER.

168
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:59,567
NO AR-15 CAN FIRE 150 ROUNDS IN

169
00:04:59,567 --> 00:04:59,967
15 SECONDS.

170
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:00,701
THAT'S UNTRUE AND IF YOU BELIEVE

171
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,070
IT IS TRUE THEN YOU ARE NOT

172
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,505
QUALIFIED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

173
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:05,273
ABOUT GUNS.

174
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:06,474
PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING AT YOU

175
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,108
BECAUSE YOU ARE IGNORANT.

176
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,042
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

177
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:12,280
TALKING ABOUT.

178
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,048
>> WE TAKE EXACTLY THE WORD OF

179
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:15,149
THE POLICE OFFICERS IN LAS VEGAS

180
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,083
WHO I TRUST WHO RAN INTO THAT

181
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,820
ROOM TO SAVE PEOPLE DOWN BELOW

182
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,987
AND FOUND A WEAPON MODIFIED WITH

183
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:20,388
FARM STOCKS.

184
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:22,023
>> Tucker: SO THEY SAY AND

185
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,357
AR-15 -- WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD

186
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:24,492
HAPPEN TO THE BARREL IN 15

187
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,661
SECONDS IF YOU PUT 150 ROUNDS --

188
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,262
IT WOULD MELT.

189
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,898
>> I KNOW THEY GET HOT.

190
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,366
>> Tucker: BEING MR. TOUGH, I

191
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,701
WAS A COP GUY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD

192
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,669
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

193
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,270
BUT YOU DON'T.

194
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,505
YOU ARE PUTTING ON TELEVISION

195
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,973
SOMETHING THAT IS DEMONSTRABLY

196
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:39,707
WRONG AND PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE

197
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:40,475
AND ALL OF YOUR VOTERS ARE LIKE

198
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:41,676
THIS GUY KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING

199
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,277
ABOUT, HE WAS A COP, BUT YOU

200
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,545
DON'T KNOW SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD

201
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,048
APOLOGIZE FOR IT.

202
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:50,218
>> I'M NOT APOLOGIZING FOR

203
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:50,585
ANYTHING.

204
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:53,087
>> Tucker: I THINK YOU SHOULD

205
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,255
APOLOGIZE FOR SAYING SOMETHING

206
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:55,590
THAT IS FACTUALLY UNTRUE.

207
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,258
>> WE NEED NEW FOCUS.

208
00:05:57,258 --> 00:06:00,695
THIS WILL BE A PRIORITY.

209
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:01,496
>> Tucker: BUT YOU DON'T KNOW

210
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:02,730
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, SO

211
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,865
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN A

212
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:04,832
POSITION TO MAKE DECISIONS

213
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:05,967
BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

214
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:06,734
ISSUE BECAUSE YOU JUST TOLD ME

215
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:07,902
WITH A STRAIGHT FACE THAT IN

216
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:11,839
AR-15 CAN FIRE 150 ROUNDS IN 15

217
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,473
SECONDS.

218
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,274
IT CAN'T.

219
00:06:13,274 --> 00:06:14,342
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ADMIT THAT AND

220
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:15,142
MOVE ON TO SOMETHING YOU

221
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:19,313
UNDERSTAND, WOULD YOU DO THAT?

222
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,248
>> THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF

223
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:20,948
ARGUMENTS THAT DON'T GET US

224
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,251
WHERE WE NEED TO BE.

225
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:28,689
WE NEED NEW -- WE ARE MOVING --

226
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:29,824
>> Tucker: I THOUGHT

227
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,158
POLITENESS DIDN'T WORK, TOUGH

228
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:31,926
GUY?

229
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:33,995
>> POLITENESS IS NOT WORKING SO

230
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:35,530
FAR.

231
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,731
YOU WANT SOMEBODY IN CONGRESS TO

232
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:37,098
STEP UP.

233
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:38,232
>> Tucker: WHY DON'T YOU GET

234
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,066
SOME FACTS?

235
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:39,767
DO LIKE THIS NEW MODE OF

236
00:06:39,767 --> 00:00:00,000
COMMUNICATION WE HAVE?
