so John hookers are back in the news and I'm gonna read this to you from the Comey memo when if they were left the news but I don't know it's a terrible word my late grandmother was in a rug hooking group in Maine and always resented that another occupation shared that title but anyway the president said the hookers thing is nonsense but that Putin had told him we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world he did not say when Putin had told him this and I don't recall then there's something redacted John what what are Trump and Putin doing talking about hookers well III cannot claim this to be my original insight because it occurred on the air of this network a little while ago with David from Amazon with Lawrence David was claiming that what has happened here is that Vladimir Putin at some in some public setting at a press conference in some kind made a comment about how I Raymond Russia has the most beautiful hookers in the world and that according to the record that we know of at this that's out there in the public right now that doesn't mean it's perfect it is the case that the first time the Donald Trump ever spoke to Vladimir Putin got according to the public record was when they talked after Trump's election just in in October or in November of 2016 so if it's true that was the first time that ever spoken it seems unlikely that Putin would have raised this topic in a congratulatory phone called a Trump so we know that when Trump went to Moscow for instance for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013 very much wanted to speak spoot n' did not get to speak to Putin again according to Russian roulette the corn is caught book so it seems according if you take this theory the David Fromm theory what Trump is doing here is lying to Comey and claiming that he had a conversation with Putin which he actually never had but in fact what Trump has done is taken a public comment by Putin that was on the topic of hookers and claimed it to have been a conversation that he had with Putin which in fact he did not have alright ai-ai-ai-aight I mean it's an extraordinarily weird thing but if we know Trump's a pathological liar he lies about everything this would not be the first time that Trump had taken something from the public record a comment made in public by someone and claimed that it was a comment that was made directly to Trump that wouldn't that is not a new thing for Trump he does that occasionally the that happens to involve Putin and hookers makes it special for those just joining us we're talking about our government and the President of the United States Sam I have for you a reading from the book of Kosta our friend Bob is on the board again tonight with a piece in The Washington Post which reads in part Trump also loudly and repeatedly complained to several advisers earlier this week that former FBI director James B Comey former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton you've heard of those people among others should be charged with crimes for misdeeds alleged by Republicans the associate said although White House officials said Thursday the Trump had not called Justice Department officials or taken any formal action the persistent grousing has made some advisers anxious according to two people close to the president Sam what's going on here well you know the weirdness of it all is that we collectively the media but also now increasingly people high up in the administration and close to the president have basically taken the tactic of letting Trump vent himself into exhaustion then moving on and it's not normal for a president to muse about using the prosecutor prosecutorial powers of the government to go our first political buttons in fact this is very abnormal it's something you'd see in Banana Republic and when at first in his presidency these types of things would happen people would be aghast at it and rightfully so but we've become numb to it and so a story like what Bob Costas has in in The Washington Post tonight gets fourth fifth billing when in any other administration we've been a five-alarm fire yeah good point just quickly just say one one quick thing here John Heilemann there just to these co-author of game.js these two stories I think are fascinating that we've just talked about because they both talked about it we reveal something about Trump's mind in the case of of the hookers right you're we good it come if you go through the Comey memos it comes up again and again he raises it in every conversation that he has with Comey according almost every conversation he comes back to the topic again it has one wood who had been mentioned in relation to the thing in Moscow well maybe I mean the Trump's there was a little bit of a Duff protest too much kind of quality too right why does he keep talking about it insisting over and over to Comey that he would have nothing to do with hookers and certainly not to do with the with the activity of the golden activity that he disputes yet no we'd never have any need for interest in why does he come back to it over and over again in the same way the hiring of Giuliani you know you hear over and over from Trump he loves his lawyers and thinks his legal team is great and he says it over and over and over again and yet the other repetitive thing that he's doing is reaching out to new lawyers all the time it's like hey cease Tojo Jenna on television tries to bring him on the team he J Goldberg the guy who was on Lawrence's show earlier and the guy talked to the Wall Street Journal yesterday about Michael Cohen flipping on Trump a lawyer that used to work for Trump in the 90s 20 years ago Trump's call on him on Friday now he's reaching out to Giuliani Trump gets stuff stuck in his craw and the stuff that sticks in Trump's craw reveals something either it reveals something that he is obsessed with and that he is like I said does protest too much something that he feels vulnerable about or the things where he senses some kind of weakness he can say over and over again that his legal team is all in great shape but his habit of perpetually and relentlessly calling out reaching out to new lawyers looking for new solutions wanting to break someone tells you about places where he feels vulnerable and not on the firmest of ground Sam do you agree on the protesting too much front because I mean there is a there is a case to be made that anyone accused of what's in that dossier what is alleged to have happened in Moscow what I was just gonna say would be pissed off perhaps I'll use a different expression would be angered to read that and looking to be cleared I suppose but I actually do agree with John and the reason I agree is a specific part of these memos which is Trump going out of his way to ask call me to look into this so that Melania Trump could feel more at ease about the accusation if you knew in your heart of hearts that these accusations were completely frivolous there was nothing to find that there are so false there will be no need to send someone out to investigate them there will be no need to send to try to discuss the Reno need to even the idea of investigation because they bTW they would seem so outlandish to anyone who knew you but instead this president not just only came back to the issue again and again again much more so than we actually knew prior to the memos being released but he proactively asked for James come and go investigate them and that to me is a tough test too much moment how would one prove that one had never done something that one would never conceivably do alright I mean I would ask you please go out and prove you know there's something I've never done we'd never consider doing Brian please go prove that I never did that thing yeah how would that work I don't know hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want
