this will indeed well we're moving along and we'll see what happens there are certain conditions that we want and I think we'll get those conditions and if we don't we don't have the meeting and frankly it has a chance to be a great great meeting for North Korea and a great meeting for the world if it doesn't happen maybe it'll happen later maybe it'll happen at a different time but we will see but we are talking the meeting scheduled as you know on June 12th in Singapore and whether or not it happens you'll be knowing pretty soon but we're talking right now I have a very strong idea how it takes place and it must take place that's what we're talking about it must take place so but I have a very strong idea and I have very strong opinions on the subject I also have very strong opinions that North Korea has a chance to be a great country and it can't be a great country under the circumstances that they're living right now but North Korea has a chance really to be a great country and I think they should seize the opportunity and we'll soon find out whether or not they want to do that South Korea China and Japan and I've spoken to all three one I happen to have right here they will be willing to help and I believe invest very very large sums of money into helping to make North Korea great I will guarantee his safety yes we will guarantee your safety and we've talked about that from the beginning he will be safe he will be happy his country will be rich his country will be hardworking and very prosperous they're very great people they are hard-working great people look at what happened with South Korea don't forget we helped South Korea we have spent trillions of dollars not billions trillions of dollars over many many years we helped South Korea and South Korea is one of the most incredible countries in terms of what they do you know that that's where you are that's where you from same people same people so yeah I think that he will be extremely happy if something works out and if it doesn't work out honestly he can't be happy but he has a chance to do something that maybe has never been done before and I think it would be if you look 25 years into the future 50 years into the future he will be able to look back and be very proud of what he did for North Korea and actually for the world but he will be very proud of what he did for North Korea I will say I'm a little disappointed because when Kim jong-un had the meeting with President Xi in China the second meeting the first meeting we knew about the second meeting I think there was a little change in attitude from Kim jong-un so I don't like that I don't like that I don't like it from the standpoint of China now I hope that's not true because we have I have a great relationship with President Xi he's a friend of mine he likes me I like him we have I mean that was two of the great days of my life being in China it was I don't think anybody's ever been treated better in China ever in their history and I just think it was many of you were there it was an incredible thing to witness and see and we built a very good relationship we speak a lot but there was a difference when Kim jong-un left China the second time and I think they were dedicating an aircraft carrier that the United States paid for okay because we paid for a lot that was built in China but I think that President Xi is a world-class poker player and I'd probably may be doing the same thing that he would do but I will say this there was a somewhat different attitude after that reading and I'm a little surprised there maybe nothing happened I'm not blaming anybody so we'll see how it all works out but in the end it'll work out can't tell you exactly how or why but it always does it's going to work out okay but would you like to see reunification at some point well I think what's going to happen is you'll start off certainly with two careers and then it's going to be largely up to them as to whether or not they get together you know that border was artificially imposed many many years ago and imposed to a certain extent and to a very large extent by us it's an artificial border but it's a border that nevertheless it took seed and that's what you have I would say that we are looking certainly right now at two Koreas to very successful crews you're gonna have a very very successful North Korea and you can have a very successful and you already do South Korea I see two Koreas and then ultimately maybe someday in the future wouldn't be now but someday in the future maybe they'll get together and you'll go back to one career you
