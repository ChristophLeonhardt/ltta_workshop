it's 6:30 in the morning here in Burnaby British Columbia and we're at the site of the Kinder Morgan trans mountain protest so-called camp cloud and it's just up the hill from us here don't worry though it's very early and nobody's stirring at that little encampment but as we were driving by up the hill we were sort of paying attention to where the trans mountain property line is and they have the signs erected here but we noticed on every single one of these poles is this little baggie of documents that sealed and then zipped died to the pulse we stopped we wanted to check it out and if you open it up bear with me here what you can see is this is a court injunction brought before the Supreme Court of British Columbia by trans Mountain by at least looks like a dozen or so protesters they've included their aliases plus John Doe Jane Doe and several persons unknown and this is a restraining order that Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain had to bring against a series of protesters just to keep them off the property and just to keep Kinder Morgan trans mountain workers safe for the rebel media I'm Shiela gunnery we're here today on Burnaby Mountain covering the camp cloud protest camp and I'll be frank with you the hopeful eviction of all of them now to see all of our footage and to help cover the cost of our travel here and to cover the cost of our security garden if you watch our footage you'll see exactly why we need it go to rebel Burnaby calm you
