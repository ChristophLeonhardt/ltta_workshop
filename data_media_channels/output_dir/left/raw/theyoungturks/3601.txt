1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,130
>>A FEW WEEKS AGO HEALTH AND
HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY TOM

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,610
PRICE WAS FORCED TO STEP DOWN
BECAUSE OF HIS USE OF PRIVATE

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,050
PLANES PAID FOR BY TAXPAYERS.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,000
IT
LOOKS LIKE HE MIGHT NOT BE ALONE

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,660
FOR THAT MUCH LONGER BECAUSE
ANOTHER SECRETARY IS INVOLVED

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,640
WITH A SIMILAR ACTIVITY, LET'S
SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,900
DISCUSSION GOING AROUND THAT --

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:31,680
>>THAT SOUNDS NICE, I'VE NEVER
BEEN ON A 

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,179
WEEKEND SKI GETAWAY --

10
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:45,449
>>AGAIN, OFFICIAL TRIPS, THAT
JUST MEANS TRIPS YOU PAID FOR

11
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:48,940
HIM TO GO ON, YET HE'S GOING OFF
AND HAVING FUN WITH THESE DONORS

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,469
AND RAISING MONEY FOR POLITICAL
PURPOSES.

13
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:52,469
IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE IT

14
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,129
ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THEY SHOULD
OUTLAW THAT OR HAVE RULES TO

15
00:00:54,129 --> 00:01:02,489
REGULATE IT, AND THEY DO --

16
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:10,070
>>WHICH IS A DIFFICULT CASE TO
MAKE WHEN YOU HAVE LITERALLY

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,009
FLOWN THROUGH THE CLOUDS ON A
TICKET PAID FOR BY ME AND CENK

18
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,140
AND JAYAR OVER THERE.

19
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,140
THEY'VE
LOOKED INTO IT --

20
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:28,810
>>SO WHILE THEY ARE ATTEMPTING
TO CLOUD THE WATERS BY SAYING

21
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,429
THAT THEY HAVE LISTENED TO THE
OFFICE OF ETHICS INSIDE THE

22
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:35,439
WHITE HOUSE AND THEY HAVE
COMPORTED THEMSELVES BASED ON

23
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,451
THOSE RULES, IT'S CLEAR AT THIS
POINT THAT THEY HAVE NOT, AND A

24
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:41,780
NUMBER OF THESE FUNDRAISERS HE
HAS GONE TO ARE THE SORT OF

25
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,710
EVENTS WHERE PEOPLE ARE PAYING 2
TO $5,000 FOR PHOTOS OR TO SHAKE

26
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:50,149
HIS HAND, RAISING MASSIVE
AMOUNTS OF MONEY WHILE BEING

27
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:57,939
THERE OSTENSIBLY FOR OFFICIAL
BUSINESS, BUT HE SURE SEEMS

28
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,999
BUSY WITH SKI RESORTS.

29
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:03,189
>>FIRST OF ALL JOHN, I HAVE BEEN
ON SKI GETAWAYS.

30
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,189
I WILL TELL YOU

31
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:06,340
ABOUT IT IN THE POST GAME
BECAUSE THERE ARE FUN STORIES IN

32
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,190
THE OLD DAYS ABOUT CHICKEN
NUGGETS AND NOT PAYING FOR THE

33
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,489
EXPENSIVE BURGERS IN THE SKI
LODGE.

34
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:15,849
WE WILL DO THAT IN THE

35
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:20,610
POST GAME FOR THE MEMBERS,
BECOME A MEMBER AND GET ALL THE

36
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,610
POST GAMES.

37
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,410
NOW ONTO ZINKE, IT
ON ONE OF THE TRIPS HE'S LIKE I

38
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,330
WENT TO A FUNDRAISER BUT I ALSO
HAD OFFICIAL BUSINESS.

39
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,330
WHAT DID

40
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,330
YOU DO?

41
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,330
I TOURED YELLOWSTONE.

42
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,720
TO
BE FAIR HE'S THE INTERIOR

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,870
SECRETARY.

44
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,940
>>HE'S PROBABLY FINDING AREAS OF
IT HE COULD SELL TO PRIVATE

45
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,940
CORPORATIONS.

46
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,090
>>DO WE HAVE OIL HERE?

47
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,980
>>I SEE SOME COPPER.

48
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,069
>>HE COULD GO TO YELLOWSTONE.

49
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,970
IF
I'M THE INTERIOR SECRETARY I

50
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,629
PROBABLY WANT TO SEE
YELLOWSTONE, LET'S PUT A COUPLE

51
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:55,090
OTHER MEETINGS AROUND THERE SO
WE DON'T WASTE TAXPAYER MONEY SO

52
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,311
IT'S WORTHWHILE -- NO, HE WANTED
TO GO TO THE FUNDRAISER, HE

53
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:03,900
WANTED TO FIND AN EXCUSE, I GOT
IT, YELLOWSTONE IS NEARBY.

54
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,940
LET'S WALK THROUGH THE PARK.

55
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,890
>>THIS ISN'T CORRUPTION OF THE
SORT WERE LIKE YOU PAY HUNDREDS

56
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,780
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO GO TO
A FOOTBALL GAME JUST TO LEAVE

57
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,140
AND GIN UP RACIAL STRIFE IN THE
COUNTRY, IT'S NOT PENCE

58
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,189
BAD, BUT IT'S BAD.

59
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:25,890
>>THEY DON'T RESPECT THE RULE OF
LAW.

60
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,130
TRUMP'S SPEECH DURING HIS

61
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,299
CONVENTION WAS WE ARE GOING TO
BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER, BUT

62
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:38,930
THE HATCH ACT IS CLEAR, ANYONE
WHO GOES AND WORKS FOR THE WHITE

63
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,490
HOUSE KNOWS THAT, THEY KNOW THEY
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO USE TAXPAYER

64
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,730
MONEY FOR FUNDRAISERS WHERE THEY
BASICALLY GET LEGALIZED BRIBES.

65
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,549
THEY DON'T CARE, THEY THINK
TRUMP HAS BROKEN EVERY RULE AND

66
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,939
STILL GOT ELECTED, SO KISS MY
ASS, I WILL USE YOUR MONEY, I

67
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,500
WILL TAKE YOUR TAX DOLLARS EVEN
THOUGH I'VE BEEN SAYING MY WHOLE

68
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,130
LIFE THAT TAX DOLLARS ARE
SACROSANCT, AND I WILL RAISE

69
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,709
MORE MONEY FOR MY BIG DONOR
FRIENDS.

70
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:05,940
AND RAISING MONEY FROM

71
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,700
DONORS NOW HAS BECOME SO
COMMONPLACE, FOR US IT IS STILL

72
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,569
A LITTLE REVOLTING, YOU HEAR
ABOUT IT, THESE GUYS GO --

73
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:17,079
COUPLES PAID $5000 TO GET THEIR
PICTURE TAKEN WITH ZINKE.

74
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,129
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING THAT'S
MORE WASTEFUL THAN THAT.

75
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,470
>>I TOLD JAYAR, THEY COULD HAVE
SAVED MONEY, GO TO A DELI, TAKE

76
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,130
A PICTURE WITH A GUY, SAY IT'S
ZINKE, NO ONE WILL KNOW.

77
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,130
WHO IS

78
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,540
GOING TO CALL YOU ON THAT?

79
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,380
>>WHAT THEY REALLY WANT OF
COURSE IS FAVORS.

80
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,380
WE'VE ALL

81
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,500
GOTTEN USED TO IT, BUT EVERYONE
IN WASHINGTON, WHICH IS A SWAMP,

82
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,980
THINKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I HAVE
TO SUCK UP WITH DONORS AND TAKE

83
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,530
PICTURES WITH THEM, AND THEN
HEAR THE FAVORS THEY WOULD LIKE,

84
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,530
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

85
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,911
YEAH, THAT'S
CALLED BRIBERY, WE SHOULDN'T GET

86
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:53,310
USED TO IT, SHOULD NEVER HAVE
MADE IT LEGAL, WE SHOULD MAKE IT

87
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,760
ILLEGAL AGAIN IN OUR DEMOCRACY.

88
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,860

89
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,630

91
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,240
RUN INTO THE WOLF PAC.

92
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,830
