the news of the night is there is no white house have you realized that yet there is no white house not since Donald Trump took the oath of office there is no white house in the traditional journalistic sense that allowed journalists and headline writers to use phrases like the White House confirmed today that's X or the White House denied today that why for that White House to exist the White House that speaks for the president that White House has to know what the president actually thinks or what the president is actually going to do or what the president actually did or what the president actually said and there's only one person in the Trump White House who knows those things and that is Donald Trump and so when the White House press secretary says the president has denied everything that storming Daniels has to say about him the White House press secretary is not telling the truth the president has never denied a single word storming Daniels has ever said about him all we have so far is the White House press secretary claiming that the president denies it we have never heard the president deny it the president has never tweeted that he denies it and the White House press secretary as far as we know has never even spoken to the President of the United States about stormy Daniels have you sat down with the president to talk about stormy Daniels what has he told you that he wants us to know about this topic as I just said as we've addressed on a number of times the president has denied these allegations and I don't have anything else further to add on that that was today two days after stormy Daniels got a bigger audience on 60 minutes than Donald Trump and his family got on 60 minutes after he won the election the White House press secretary was asked have you sat down with the president to talk about storming Daniels and the White House press secretary refused to answer that question that's a simple yes no have you sat down with the president to talk about stormy Daniels yes or no we didn't get a yes or a No we got nothing on that question it was coupled with the question what has he told you that he wants us to know about this topic and then Sara Sanders says that the president has denied these allegations but she will not say that the president has actually denied it directly to her and so we can safely assume that the White House press secretary has not sat down with the president to talk about stormy Daniels and we can safely assume that the White House press secretary has never heard the president deny what stormy Daniels says about him and no one in the White House press corps should ever allow anyone in the White House briefing room to say that the president has denied these allegations because he has not here is the same White House press secretary talking about President Trump after he launched a Twitter attack against MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski I think he's been very clear that when he gets attacked he's gonna hit back I think the American people elected somebody who's tough who's smart and who's a fighter and that's Donald Trump she's very proud that he hit back at Mika Brzezinski well the people who voted for hitting back are having to wait longer than they've ever had to wait before for Donald Trump to hit back to hit back at stormy Daniels or at stormy Daniels lawyer Michael avenatti who has been very effectively insulting the intelligence of Donald Trump and Donald Trump's lawyers here is Michael avenatti last night on this program that was a catastrophic mistake on their part and the reason why it is is because and I don't want to get too far down in the weeds but under the Federal Arbitration Act which is what the federal court is going to apply when determining whether to send the case to arbitration we get expedited discovery relating to whether there was an actual agreement and we're entitled we are entitled to a trial on that issue so you get discovery you get Donald Trump under oath in a deposition discovery just on the matter of was there an agreement correct oh boy so now they did say that's a trap okay so it sounds like a trap lining so we laid that trap and they they step right right center of it that was me learning something on TV doesn't happen that often but Michael avenatti taught me a few things Friday night on hardball Michael avenatti told Chris Matthews that he was firing a warning shot quote to Michael Cohen and any other supporter of the President and to the President himself a warning shot Michael avenatti says right at the president himself and all those Trump voters who Sarah Sanders said voted for someone who's gonna hit back are still waiting because Donald Trump is terrified of Michael avenatti and he is terrified of stormy Daniels just terrified here's more from the White House press briefing today look the president I didn't say he punches back on every single topic if he did he would probably be addressing a lot of the stories that most of you write every single minute of every single day he also has a country to run and he's doing a great job with that sometimes he chooses to specifically engage and punch back and sometimes he doesn't as I told Rachel the wall behind us here is a partial partial list of the names the President of the United States has found the time to punch back at as Sarah Sanders would put it stormy Daniels name is not there Michael Evan Oddie's name is not there the president certainly has the time to tweet attacks against both of them but he now knows that if he publicly calls stormy Daniels a liar Michael avenatti has a defamation lawsuit ready to go against the President of the United States and Michael avenatti will have yet another legal Avenue for getting the President of the United States under oath in a legal deposition about what he really did with storming Daniels but there is a way to make all of this go away an easy way to make us all stop covering the stormy Daniels story Donald Trump could simply drop the litigation he has brought against storming Daniel's he could drop the case he could order Michael Cohen to just rip up the confidentiality agreement completely released stormy Daniels from the confidentiality agreement and then stormy Daniel goes goes away because after all the confidentiality agreement prevents her from saying what she has already said twice once in an extensive interview with In Touch magazine in 2011 and once again this weekend on 60 minutes Donald Trump and Michael Cohen are now engaged in a pointless lawsuit to try to prevent stormy Daniels from saying what she has already said on 60 minutes in a video that is now going to live forever we will be allowed to replay that 60 minutes video forever the stormy Daniels 60 minutes interview will be seen by historians a hundred years from now nothing can be done about that now the Federal Election Commission will move very slowly as it always does on the investigation of the illegal campaign contribution of one hundred and thirty thousand dollars that Michael Cohen in effect made in the last week of the presidential campaign by paying stormy Daniels a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to stay quiet about candidate Donald Trump the only thing that's keeping this story alive on a daily basis now is that the President of the United States has taken legal action in federal court against stormy Daniels to stop her from telling the story that she has already told and that makes absolutely no sense any good lawyer would tell Donald Trump now to drop his case against stormy Daniels unless unless Donald Trump knows that stormy Daniels still has something that she can reveal about him that is even more dangerous to him than what she has already said hey
