articles of impeachment have been introduced against Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen Stein while representative mark meadows introduced articles of impeachment against fraud Rosenstein so what does this mean and how does the process work well here's how it works these articles now go to the House Judiciary Committee Bob good lads committee and they're gonna require of the 40 committee members a majority vote 21 of those committee members if they get the 21 votes they get out of committee as it's called the Beng goes to the House floor for a full vote they're gonna need 218 of the 435 House members so a simple majority if that happens rod Rosen Stein is impeached but he still stays on his job unless Jeff Sessions or the president fires him it would then go to the Senate to the Senate rather for a trial and that would require a two-thirds vote in the Senate that won't happen so the best we can hope for is impeachment will that happen I don't know I don't know if we have 21 votes on the dish hearing committee I don't think we have 218 votes in the house because Republicans are not cohesive if it were Democrats against Rosen Stein and they had the majority he'd be out he'd be out but why is it important to do this why do I liked it that medows introduced these articles alongside Jim Jordan because Congress needs teeth right now I mean Congress is sending a message if you hide info from them if you don't cooperate with them if you defy a subpoena if you don't testify truthfully if you're arrogant combative dismissive or disrespectful there's nothing they can do sure if you defy a subpoena they can go to a federal judge and of the US Marshals come and haul you out or hole you out of your home and into court or into the hearing room but that almost never happens I don't know I can't recall any time it's ever happened so Congress has no tea and these articles of impeachment are important to tell high-ranking government officials like the number two with the Justice Department that you're not above the law you do have oversight Congress can ask you questions and you are expected to answer them truthfully Congress can request and you must comply with those deadlines and produce them now after the recent release of the FISA application although heavily redacted we know what's going on here we know the DOJ and the FBI are terrified of the truth coming out because it truly looks like they tried to rig the process against Donald Trump they're terrified they don't want their dirty little secrets exposed but that's not our problem and it's not Congress's problem Oh Congress needs to get this these articles impeachment out of committee they need to get them on the floor for a vote and if Congress wants to retain a shred of credibility of authority of power with regards to its oversight role they need to impeach rod Rosen Stein I'm gonna bring in his stories every day and I'm gonna keep you updated on these rows and Stein articles of impeachment also check out my news show Declassified live every morning live 7:30 a.m. on the rebels YouTube channel I take your questions and comments thanks for watching I'll see you tomorrow
