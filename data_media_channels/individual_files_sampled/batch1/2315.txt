so it's got there's obviously tons of forms of media you've got novels you've got films you got commercials you've got drawings you've got what is rules in gallatin and how have you sort of openness up to the transmedia world for lack of a better term well Rinnegan is our first internally produced intellectual property and it is a fantasy world that was originally created by us we open it up to the community and it is a multimedia world in the sense that we offer people the option of submitting fiction our role playing game materials comics essentially any medium that can be digitized and put up on the web we'll take submissions and we'll put the best up on the web it's our first property to demonstrate the potential of the model and it was purposefully done in a way that was an extremely an extreme version of the model we wanted to push the envelope in every direction is possible to see if the mount of a break so far we haven't found that to be true so we used to extreme version what does that mean like what is extreme so this is ruins of gallatin and what is not strength well the base model the brain candy has is flexible scalable we can scope it to meet the goals of whatever the property owner happen whatever goals interested in parties they happen have so for example ownership model the revenue aspect of the model those types of things can be adjusted to base to meet the needs of the property owner bruins a gallon on what we did was say how do we make this as extreme as possible how do we make it as friendly to the community as possible so what we've done to say you create a novel you create some piece of art or an image you submitted we post it under the ruins of gallon on model you retain ownership over that we don't purchase rights under any circumstances what we do is say we will exchange non-exclusive commercial rates which means you as the creator can continue to make money from it and we just ask that you show revenue with us and the same is true for us and that particular model we think is very artisan friendly we also say from a revenue standpoint under erisa gallatin we split money at a 50-50 gross level as a to something that's on the net side now that's not something we would propose for most properties it's certainly not something we propose for a large media company but it just goes to show you that with very little marketing this particular model can work we've been getting submissions for over a year now we've been putting them up online and the community has shown an interest in playing this particular world under these terms so walk me through I'm a player or I am in this world and I i do what i read this i decided i like a secondary character i draw a picture of them i submit it like how does this work well you've got two different types of participants in the world you've got just the pure consumers who come to the site read fiction look at the art and they go away then you've got others who are more active they might participate in the forum they might contribute to the wiki they might actually create a new work and submit it to the world so it might be you stumble across a particular art image and you say oh that's a great idea for a story i'm going to write a story based on that art image or you read a fictional work by some other artisan and say i really like this minor character i'd like to explore what's happening with that character and under the ruins of gallatin model that's totally fine you're not infringing the copyright law when you grab that minor character you write your own fiction turn around assume that that derivative work back to brain candy we evaluate that and if it's really good we put it up on the website so my revenue could be endless I mean if you have all these factions of people sprouting off and and contributing their own work and then having somebody riff off of what you've done I mean the revenue model seems to just sort of grow exponentially well it certainly can and again it's obvious content is absolutely I mean that the whole purpose of this is to have a constant stream of content coming in that the property I can decide what to put up what not to put up and they're able to take that constant stream of content continually build out the property basically give the fans more we more ways and means to engage with the property over a persistent time period and it can be as simple as a derivative work like I said a fictional word based on an artwork by someone else it can get pretty complex you could have 10 or 12 or 15 artisans all playing with the same character working in the same city with their particular medium and that's actually part of the point is to make it as collaborative and integrative as possible but almost seems like what works here would be a great model for what would work in the offline world like are you seeing stories or what not working this world that have translated offline does it go digital to analog I mean is that translate at all absolutely I mean the whole point here is that you want to have multiple revenue streams beyond just advertising so what you want to do in a digital will say let's look at the most popular works in the property whether it's a novel or a collection of art let's bundle them up and offer them in an analog revenue sharing type model so for example rather than say let's give spend millions of dollars in make a TV show and hope that people like it in the digital website you're looking at it going okay I'm going to take a look at the highest downloaded novel or the most looked at art I'll bundle them all up I'll offer through a traditional print offering and I'll saw it that way because i know this is already the most popular content in the property so how where do you see this extreme model fitting in to say the entertainment world well the extreme model is probably not going to be it probably won't find a box chain incorrect yes I mean it's extreme for a reason what we do is say look here's here to prove that with very little money you can launch a brand new property and have people playing in these conditions you adjust the model you can make it more traditional you can make it look more like a conservative entertainment property model yeah we revenue split exactly exactly change the rules of the sandbox and how people participate in play that's certainly possible it's one of the benefits of the model we've got are you seeing anybody on there do this other than you guys we have been actively looking for about two years and we haven't seen anyone do anything on the scope and scale of runes of gallon on we've seen some attempts that seem to generate come that they arise and then wither and die we haven't seen anyone persistently out there the way we have been if there are out there I want to know about them have them contact me but I haven't seen anyone try and take such a professional legal and narrative structure approach to a collaborative properly way we have great thanks cut thank you very much
