Democrats continue their downward spiral as pollsters up Republican chances for the midterms all of which exposes a fundamental rule of politics when your opponent gets angry your opponent gets stupid then CNN and Twitter exposed themselves as hypocrites president Trump offers voters an honest choice and Teen Vogue gives us the dumbest article on the Internet today all that and more I'm Michael Nolan this is the Michael Knowles show things are going from bad to worse for Senate Democrats some other candidates as well looking really bad Nate Silver the you know he's the pollster who made his career just predicting that Obama would win things Nate silver a left-leaning pollster is saying that right now there's a better chance that the GOP picks up votes in the Senate then that the Democrats take the Senate people are losing their minds in these rate Heidi Heitkamp beta O'Rourke you know the Mexican beta O'Rourke Malladi Oh better Boy the pipes the pipes are calling will cover all of those races first I've got to make a little money honey and I've got to tell you about purple mattress listen I've told you about purple mattress but I think last week week before so I had just

chance than Democrats taking the Senate right now the Senate is very close and who knows anything could happen in the midterms the party that holds the White House is supposed to lose seats maybe lose the Congress lose the Senate things are looking pretty good to drive this point home things are looking so good right now for Republicans compared to what they should be looking like that there's this candidate in in Nevada GOP candidate for state legislature who is a pimp he owns a bunch of brothels he died a few days ago a dead pimp discovered it as brothel by ron jeremy the 70s porn star after a party that was attended by joe arpaio the sheriff Grover Norquist the tax guy and Tucker Carlson called in dead the guy is actually dead dead pimp in Nevada he is poised to win his race it is right now all of the polling suggests a dead pimp in Nevada is gonna win the race because he's a Republican over the Democrat this is unbelievable stuff now look anything that could happen here I don't want you to be confused with my making a prediction predictions can become self-fulfilling here if the Republicans don't feel motivated they won't get out the vote and they're gonna lose everything they're going to lose everything and then they're gonna whip each Trump and then they're gonna try to convict Trump in the Senate an eight silver the left wing pollster still puts Democrats at an eighty four percent chance of taking the house that's what the data say right now data have been wrong before I've got four hundred smackers in a check signed by Ben Shapiro over there because the data were wrong in 2016 anything could happen right now enthusiasm is really high on the Republican side this is some something of what is unprecedented in part it's because of Cavanaugh in part it's because of Lyle waffle is warned in part it's because of these unfair the Russia investigation that's I think now and its 75th year it's good you know all of these things seemed very unfair the news media stacked against them and that everything is going so well in the country which we'll cover a little bit later but you know the economy is going well unemployment basically doesn't exist things are going gangbusters Alan Greenspan the former Federal Reserve Chairman says that this is the tightest labor market he's ever seen in his life and Alan Greenspan is like 7,000 years old so things are going really well that's why Republican enthusiasm is up Democrat enthusiasm is really high too so let's say Republicans have enthusiasm at 2010 levels Democrat enthusiasm is really high which means it's anybody's game it's all about getting Republicans out there and and depressing the Democrat vote which the mainstream media and Democrats themselves have done pretty pretty well I wonder I think there's a chance that maybe only one out of 1,024 Democrats will actually show up you know we'll only get one 1020 forth of the Democrat expected vote but they've really gone mad so this gets to my central thesis here which is that when your opponent gets angry your opponent behaved stupidly get angry go mad get stupid and Donald Trump has made them angry he's driven them mad and therefore they've gotten a little bit stupid to just give you a little taste of this I will show you a glimpse of every Democrat voter in the country that that about sums it up that's pretty much every voter ripping up the sign you know getting all crazy this was a guy who was just walking down the street trying to tear up Ted Cruz signs obviously the Democrats have been driven mad they they have a madness they have gone crazy that guy looks like a demon he's BM what what have you to do with us Ted Cruz our hour is not yet come ah whatever you know you're ours now yucca we mentioned this last week voxcom the left-wing outlet has been encouraging democrats to practice witchcraft it's not a joke you know pat robertson said this in 92 he said that feminism makes people practice witchcraft now voxcom is proving him right they're saying yeah democrats should practice witchcraft in solidarity with one another there was a story out today that a woman has become an abortion doula in New York you know a doula to help a woman through pregnancy she's become the opposite of that she's become an abortion doula and she's asked and begged to be in the room for 2,000 abortions and the woman looks like a witch she's got crazy colored hair she looks all kooky she looks like you I mean if you just look up witch in the dictionary you'll get this woman also speaking of witches and demons these antifa the quote-unquote anti-fascists in Brooklyn from catland books are now calling themselves witches and they're saying that they're going to put a hex on Brett Kavanaugh they're going to use a bunch of spells and magic and things like that to put a hex on our new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and when they were asked about this why is aunt Eva the this left-wing political group why are they associating with witchcraft they said this quote we are embracing witchcrafts true roots as the magic of the poor the downtrodden and disenfranchised and its history as often the only weapon the only means of exacting justice available to those of us who have been wronged by men now that luckily we've got priests and exorcists praying for Brett Kavanaugh so hopefully the hex won't work and the empty feh lunatic witches will be a stymied but reminds me of a central book on the left rules for radicals by Saul Alinsky so olenski tactics used by Barack Obama a friend of Hillary Clinton's Hillary Clinton wrote her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky they had a lot of correspondence back and forth she called him a mentor and a friend of hers and Saul Alinsky dedicated his most famous book rules for radicals to Lucifer to that first rebel who won himself a kingdom Lucifer he dedicated after the first edition I think they took that dedication out but it's in the first edition and it really does make me wonder look at the imagery on both sides you've got broadly across the left people adopting witchcraft imagery cultish imagery satanic imagery evil wicked dark imagery and then you know obviously on the right there's a the religious right that adopts a light imagery godly imagery I don't think that's an accident I really don't think that's an accident and just listen to how those witches in Brooklyn and how Saul Alinsky you know the the community organizer thug who was a an ideological hustler especially exploiting poor people they they put these witchcraft images into ideological leftist terms they say witchcraft is about the poor over the rich or about the oppressed over the oppressors or this or that they're using all of that divisive language of the left making about us versus them we're gonna start a new world us but we're gonna conquer them it's all about division it's all about greed and ultimately it's all about failure I really don't think it's a coincidence you know and that this is a step along the road you make your opponents angry you make them mad you make them lose their minds you make them look like that guy with the Cruz signs I hate Ted Cruz bad not bad not bad I was oh I'm sorry by the way that almost lapsed into a sweet little ELISA voice I didn't mean to do that that was a demon voice that I I was intending this is the rule you make your opponents angry you make them mad and you get them to act stupidly this is the great advantage we have going into these midterms heidi heitkamp we talked about this yesterday running in in North Dakota she is Democrat she's down by a lot she was already down by about 12 points and she released a newspaper ad listing purported victims of sexual assault the only problem was they never consented to have their names in the newspaper ad some of them don't support Heidi Heitkamp some of them say they weren't even sexually assaulted I mean this is a total catastrophe for hike camp a total meltdown she came out and she apologized but I mean this is probably gonna kill her campaign the fallout is still happening here is one of the women who was named in that advertisement giving giving her opinion of Heidi Heitkamp tactic we just heard from Senator Heitkamp who said all I can do is say I'm sorry I want to know what I can do to fix this has she said that personally to you that she's sorry um no she has not you were told though as I understand it that she would be reaching out uh yep I was told that she was gonna reach out to every one of the women that was um you know put in this without our consent but she has yet to reach out to me she said she also wants to know what she can do to fix this is there something in your mind we could do uh you know the damage has kind of already been done you know the names that didn't want to be put out they're already out there for the world to see and you can't really retract that the damage is done the damage is already done you there are certain things you can't undo there are certain things you can't unsay you know in politics slick politicians are always trying to leave themselves wiggle room always leave yourself an exit strategy whatever you say whatever promise you make whatever tactic you employ and usually good politicians are very careful about all of these things but when you start to really get emotional when you start to get really passionate when you start to get really angry you start to make mistakes and that's what Heidi Heitkamp did here she was so whipped up into a frenzy by the me2 movement by the Kavanaugh stuff by Donald Trump talking about women that she allowed herself to make a colossal mistake you can't you can't take that back and so it doesn't look like she's got a real future this is another point I want to underscore we talked about this when nikki Haley gave that speech about how we shouldn't own the libs how it's a bad idea to own the libs and to get people angry and to get to trigger them and to make of them because it doesn't persuade anybody nonsense this is why you have to own the lips this is why because you whip your opponents into an anger and into a frenzy and then they make mistakes they hang themselves they tie the rope and they throw it over the beam you know I mean they were really will do they will do the work for you it's not that Donald Trump is some master tactician and strategist I don't think he is at all I think he's extraordinarily effective because he triggers his opponents into doing all the damage themselves and that's that's what's happened with this hype camp thing here is here are some I mean the fallout even on CNN even on these left-wing outlets even on the the mainstream news ABC NBC even they have to admit that this was a big error listen to what some of the other victims are saying she says she's terrified for her safety like many other victims because of this situation that's right it's actually putting these girls in danger the reason that voice was all messed up is because she's trying to hide her identity and hide her voice so they put a little scrambler on her but of course it's tantamount to daxing people in the age of social media in the age where you can look up someone's name and find out basically where they are this is tantamount to daxing there were people who were trying to Doc's United States senators in in the US Congress and those people were real I mean that that is felonious behavior and but they're doing it because they were whipped into such a frenzy they couldn't see the consequences of their actions this was such an obvious blunder just someone who is thinking clearly but you've always got to think clearly I think this is also true for the people on the right you know some people on the right were really triggered by President Trump as both this president and as a candidate and they started thinking emotionally a little bit too and some of them have egg on their face now you don't want to do that you should always view politics clearly politics lives on outrage of thrives on outrage we'll explain why Donald Trump knows this and he's using it too are all of our in a little bit but you you at least have to try to think clearly you know what I have this rule on Twitter if I ever sinned or to get angry which is almost never happens if I ever start to feel that way I log off Twitter I don't I cuz then you make mistakes you don't want to leave yourself open to making those kinds of mistakes by the way the mainstream media mob word carefully selected the mainstream media mob or letting themselves make mistakes too because they are really starting to lose it as well here is just a clip from I think her name was Brooke Baldwin she so you know this this whole mob issue she said this girl on her show Brooke Baldwin said I'm not gonna let people use that talking point I'm not gonna let them use the word mine she cut off this guy cuz he said Democrats are behaving like a mob you know there's mob violence Democrats are calling for more mob violence at politicians homes she I'm not gonna let you use that talking point here's her defending her line so we had Matt Lewis on who I love having on from The Daily Beast and he brought up the word mob and at the time the mob the mob word had been this talking point from Republicans from all up and down Capitol Hill in the wake of what had happened with with dr. Ford and justice Cavanaugh and so when he brought the mob word up again I I called him I called him out and listen like I don't want to be the word police and that was not my intention but I also believe in calling out talking points and to hear him bring that up I had to I had to say something I don't want to be the word police but she say you know and they say but it means the opposite of what I just said that's always oh well I don't I support free speech but and so she's okay but fair enough she says I think those talking points they're shallow they're cheap and I'm not gonna let people get away with talking points on my show ain't gonna happen right hold on let's cut back a few weeks or a few months are you sure about that per Bolton she made a determination with her doctor that she would power through this she made a decision to just power through this we've decided to power through sometimes just power through this continue to power through what yes she tried to power through it she decided to power through it well you know for she just wanted to power through she just wanted to power through her schedule so she wanted to just power through and keep doing it I appreciate all of their desire to power through power through and get things done if she tried to power through it it was Hillary Clinton's decision essentially to power through yeah Brooke you know and Brooke supports our powering through it because she powers through Brooke powers through to I think I think Brooke likes to power through certain talking points but doesn't want to power through other talking points because she's a hack I mean this obviously you could you could pull up this kind of footage and the thing about power through I mean you had Robby Mook the Clinton campaign chairman pushing this line whereas an unbroken they were talking about the mob mentality of the left right now you had Matt Lewis who's just a writer for The Daily Beast he's actually the left wing publication he's making the point that they actually are calling for mob violence Maxine Waters is calling for mob violence Democrats around the country or using mob violence and she says you can't use that one now if you were talking about Hillary power and through all right maybe we can get along with that so so they're getting sloppy the left is getting sloppy now this has been the case since basically since Donald Trump announced he was running for president certainly since November 2016 so we're also seeing this in big tech so it's not just the politicians it's not just the media it's also in big technology Twitter at this point I think has no even remotely plausible claim to being fair to treating the left in the right fairly this happened within the last couple days because of one Louis Farrakhan Louis Farrakhan you know the Nation of Islam certain if anybody is a hate monger in the united states as Louis Farrakhan he talks about the white devil talks about the Satanic Jews he's a race hustler you know for black people and by the way yeah they actually took a photo with Barack Obama in 2005 that the mainstream media buried it they would not let this be released during the presidential election because Farrakhan is such a wicked dude he's such a hatemonger and he's such a race hustler so Farrakhan though still is allowed to have his Twitter account Twitter doesn't mind he posted a tweet that said I'm not anti-semite I'm anti along with this video clip why folk don't like vodka some of them respect me but those who have been our deceivers they can't stand me so when they talk about Farrakhan call me a hater you know what they do call me an anti-semite stop it I'm auntie termite do you get it do you get what he is saying the Jews according to Louis Farrakhan are like bugs that eat away at wood in your house did you get it I just in case you didn't get it because that's Louis Farrakhan he's allowed to have his Twitter meanwhile Alex Jones all Alex Jones is doing is warning people that you know the freaking frogs are turning gay all he's trying to do is shirtless Li sell vitamins to people he loses his Twitter account Gavin McGinnis who just wrestles babies that's I think is the biggest crime in life as it he wrestles newborn babies he loses his Twitter account but Louis Farrakhan who calls Jews termites he gets to keep his Twitter account that's how that's how it works because those two guys are brought of Jones and Gavin are considered broadly within the the right-wing Jones a little less oh but Gavin is and Louis Farrakhan is considered within the left-wing so they let Louis Farrakhan keep his Twitter account what this is showing is that nothing ever changes in politics it's showing that big tech is now taking over the role of the mainstream media in censoring conservatives for decades and decades the mainstream media not only censored conservatives but they wouldn't let conservatives go on their shows and then only present them in the way that the left wanted to present them so they distort what they had to say they would pervert their messages they would always filter conservative thought through the lens of the mainstream media a new media and big technology allowed us to get our message out there unadulterated that's how you're seeing the show right now probably and but now you know more and more YouTube will censor those shows will de monetize those shows Facebook same thing more and more Twitter will cancel the accounts or censor the accounts or suspend the accounts of conservative people and not do the same on the left they are now taking over the role of the media in the censoring conservatives alike I like this story in a certain sense because it means that politics is never over the left is always coming out to get you and the Empire is always striking back which you know fair enough that means you've got to stay on your toes there's there's nothing new Under the Sun and it means that we have to innovate you know part of the reason I think that Republicans and conservatives have had an advantage here is because there's all this pressure to innovate to innovate on policy conservatives have have been leading on policy for certainly my entire lifetime and before that left the left has no policy ideas that the only policy idea is to go back to 19th century socialism that's the left big policy idea but all of the think tanks are conservative all of the actual policy centers are conservative because there is a pressure on us to innovate same thing with new media conservatives dominate new media why do they dominate because there's a pressure on us we have to do it or else we can't get our message yet and now conservatives are gonna have to innovate again you know we had a good run in this iteration of social media and we're gonna have to keep innovating again all of this is a little bit of a sideshow all of this is a little bit of what's gonna happen in November what's gonna happen in the midterms what's gonna very few people are talking about what is happening right now in the levers of government and this underlies a totally false attack from the left and the right on dumb Trump which is that he's too sensationalist he's too much of a showman I just want him to you know sign tax laws or whatever I just want him to tweak parts of the welfare state okay right when he does that no one would cover it he would have no ability to galvanize public support on those issues here's one example of it during a cabinet meeting President Trump made a pretty big announcement gave a pretty big directive to his cabinet secretaries which items certain you haven't seen anywhere but it's very important here he is ask everybody to come back with a 5% cut our next meeting I think you'll all be able to do it it may be a special exemption perhaps I don't know who that exemption would be if you can do more than 5 some of you will say hey I can be much more than 5 I'm sorry was doing my Ruth Bader Ginsburg impression while I was watching that that cabinet meeting because nobody's watching this and nobody's watching it because while it's very very important it's not a show so people aren't going to cover it it's Donald Trump at a cabinet meeting saying you know we need to do is cut these departments by 5% if we cut them by 1 percent year over year over year we would ever a number of years we would have a significant reduction certainly in the growth of the federal government if not in the federal government itself Trump is saying we're going to do even more than that we're going to reduce it 5% within this year and I'm sure we can do it of course they can do that nevertheless and nobody's going to cover that because it's actually Trump just holding a meeting one thing this shows us is that there is a serious Trump all we think is of cocoa FFA and horseface Trump but there is this serious Trump who look the guy's a workaholic he's built a lot of businesses he's risen to the top of very difficult fields obviously this guy can work within normal business environments but he eat because he's a showman he understands that that's how you galvanize public support and we need the showmanship because this would not be covered this would not galvanize public support this would not get a win even though it's extraordinarily important work and I just want to point out every now and again that very important work like this deregulation shrinking parts of the federal government cutting back on certain costs this that is happening right now you're just not seeing it because it's not part of the show and probably it's good that you're not seeing that part of it it's probably good to have the media off your jabbering about horseface which is totally trivial and doesn't matter at all because what really matters is this and we don't want the mainstream media's eyes on us shrinking parts of the government hopefully shrinking more of the government as the administration goes on the other good thing the president Trump has done for the office of the presidency is that he's made it less mystical less majestic less he's taken less responsibility for every little thing that happens in the entire world President Trump was asked to give his thoughts and what would happen in the midterm elections here's what he thinks if they don't go out and vote then they have themselves to blame because they'll lose wealth tremendous amount I built up eleven point seven trillion dollars and wealth you report on it I've built up all this wealth in the country we've built up all the economies to it done so so well if people don't go out there and vote for Republicans they have nothing nobody but themselves to blame I'd love this answer because during the Obama administration all you would hear is it's me I will I will make the Seas sea levels lower I will uh we are the ones that we've been waiting for we are it's me me me I me my all through the night I me my I me my I me my you're doing is George Harrison impression Donald Trump actually doesn't do that for a guy who slaps his name on every building he's ever seen in his life he actually says look under all I can do is what I'm doing I'm just Donald Trump what do you expect from me I'm Donald Trump I deregulate I cut taxes I make the the country friendlier to businesses I make the government friendlier to business but you've got to go out there and vote I'm not gonna do that I can't do that for you and if you don't want it alright that's your fault that's a good attitude because you can't just throw all of your hopes and dreams to quote Barack Obama onto one guy Trump is not a god he's not a deity he's not a messiah he's Donald Trump he emphatically and manifestly not any of those other things and so we got him he's a great tool he's a great leader he's actually a great political leader he's a great political executive he's not a messiah you've got to go out and do the work of reelecting Republicans or you're not going to keep getting it and if you can't do it you got nobody to blame but your self we have a lot of mailbag to get to right now before we do that though I have got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube look I I know that we're probably already being censored on there anyway some of your on daily wire.com you've got to subscribe to daily wire right now why one because we're going to politican this weekend we're to be a politican in Los Angeles on Saturday and Sunday I'm gonna be there on some if you're not in LA if

you come on over there also because you need your leftist ears tumblr okay I know it's ten bucks a month hundred dollars for an annual membership you get me the under claiming show the bench bureau show you get asked questions in the mailbag which is coming up questions in the conversation this is what you need and if you drown in a sea of leftist tears you've got nobody to blame but yourself I'm channeling my inner Donald Trump you've got nobody to blame but yourself because this I have warned you you've seen the tidal wave coming you've got the vessel it's not that expensive go to daily wire calm we'll be right back with the mailbag all right here we go from Carlos since you are a Catholic I'm guessing you don't believe in same-sex marriage do you also believe the government has the authority to make same-sex marriage illegal if so what would be the arguments for doing so it's true that I'm a Catholic but my opinion of the redefinition of marriage does not hinge on my Catholic faith it's not that I think that gay marriage should be legal or illegal I think gay marriage is a contradiction in terms this is no offense to friends of mine who are gay or who have any any sort of sexual preference at all it's about what marriage is and unfortunately during the the question of gay marriage when the Supreme Court stole it from the public sphere we totally missed this debate the question isn't who should have the right to get marriage the question is what is marriage the people who support same-sex marriage say that sexual difference doesn't in here in marriage well your man or your woman it doesn't matter it has nothing to do with marriage marriage is just what is marriage sir well you know it's the union of two people who really like each other okay that could be friends well no it's the union of two people who really like each other and have sex with each other that could also be friends you know welcome to 2018 well no it's the Union for well for this or that they can't quite give an explanation for all of human history sexual difference has been the essence of marriage a union of husbands and wives at least one husband usually just one life sometimes more than one wife depending on your culture in the West basically it's for a very long time it's been one man and one husband and one wife because those two complement one another in the beginning God created man both male and female he created them in our culture in the Western culture they the husband and the wife leave their families cleave together for what purpose well there's the logical possibility of life of procreation of creating a family if the family being the essential building block of society the the question that you have to ask yourself if you support redefining marriage to encode there are a few questions you have to ask yourself if you support redefining marriage to include monogamous same-sex unions if you say sexual difference doesn't matter is why not include polygamous same-sex unions why that's not I'm not being I'm not trying to be offensive in any way why wouldn't you if it's just about the union of people who love each other III know polygamists and polyamorous people why I've been you know I've I wouldn't call them close friends but they're acquaintances at least why wouldn't that constitute marriage well if sexual difference doesn't in here in marriage them then then what does marriage become what is it really about I've never heard a good answer to this why should why should the Supreme Court decide that I don't know marriage has a definition and the Supreme Court can't change that and I don't think public debate even can change that though I'd prefer if public debate did over the Supreme Court marriage has a definition in there for gay marriage is a logical impossibility does it mean that gay people can't live together or do whatever they want or sign contract no of course not go with God man I'm not here to tell you how to live your life but but it means that you can't change the word you can't change logic if we don't have if we can't agree on definitions we can't live together in a society we can't communicate so that's that's my position on that I guess now this is an unpopular position even though virtually everybody in the entire West held it until just a few years ago I think that our current misunderstanding of the definition of words is a is a momentary madness I think at some point we'll wake up from that but right now people are very confused and which is why you've got activists in the street shrieking and howling it's because they're very confused and they can't articulate their points of view from Joseph dear Michael the world has ended civilization as we know it has collapsed and been reset you are one of the few who have survived this disaster so what three items besides the Bible would you take with you into this new world why thanks and by the way I don't think you are execrable well you know I probably a purple mattress movement watch in a week of blue apron that's what I take into the world promo code Kofi baby beyond that if I had to choose another three I would choose this is very hard these questions are always impossible but to reconstruct civilization I would probably choose I would bring Dante the Divine Comedy annotated Divine Comedy because the Divine Comedy includes basically all of Western culture is referred to in it or alluded to or brought in together Western Christian theology and philosophy and ancient philosophy and literature and it's the greatest work of art in the West so I'd take that I would take Shakespeare specifically Hamlet because Hamlet is talking about the crack-up of Western civilization probably the thing that sowed the seeds for what led to that apocalypse that I'm now trying to recover from and and all the works of Shakespeare and probably Aristotle so I would take literature I would take really extraordinary literature and theology literature and philosophy I wish that we could get a little history in there too but you said I could only take three things from Spenser Oh Knowles who knows in your opinion how can we best discover God's will for our lives how can we distinguish God's will from what merely happens to us more specifically how can we know whether or not we've acted in accordance with God's will when we make crucial decisions such as where to go to school whom to marry where to work etc Spenser it is a wicked generation that looks for signs and wonders as as the Bible tells us but it is a stupid generation that ignores signs and wonders so so you shouldn't you know be trying to interpret tea leaves when you're trying to figure out if you should go to this college or marry this person or whatever however we I think with all many of us have had numinous experience the experience of coincidence or Providence or whatever that really makes you think huh all right this has the unmistakable mark of God on it when these things happen they don't always give you a right answer I can't often these experiences these religious experiences are ineffable so they're really hard to relate in words what they are but you know it's like pornography you can't define it but you know when you say it I mean that's the only way it's like pornography so what I would say when I've had these experiences when friends of mine have had these experiences while we're trying to make certain decisions what I oh I don't interpret them to mean one course of action or the other or this or that I always take them to mean that God is there and that you know maybe you're on the right track maybe you're where you're supposed to be because you're seeing you're seeing a sign or a wonder for all the rest of it you should use your reason you should use your desire and your will and your intellect and pursue the virtues you know I mean it's it's on you man it's your life you've got to lead your life and fortunately there is the grace of God that abounds and that will help you out and lead you in the right way and there's the helper and the Advocate but it requires a your own will and as well so it's not you can't look to signs and wonders to be an excuse not to use your own faculties of reason in your own determination and courage and will and all the other virtues you got to do that but in a way don't worry about it so much because God is there but you've got to put in the effort and you you've got to put in the work and you know just remember in the long run as long as you're doing the right thing you can't go wrong from an hi Michael just found out the the leftists are using the Lord's name in vain they always do that claiming Jesus is a Palestinian please explain this rhetoric and oh it's because they're very dumb I think that's why they're they're going Jesus of Palestine for a while they were saying Jesus is black or Jesus is it's always just in to be used in political debates so when there was a political debate in the United States over black and white race relations they would they would do that now there's a big political debate over Israelis and their treatment of Palestinian Arabs and so were they're saying Jesus was a Palestinian he wasn't he isn't he isn't a Palestinian Christ is a Jew he's he he partook of Jewish customs he did Jewish things he taught in the temple he died died for your sins and was resurrected on the third day and but he's not a Palestinian what the point that they're trying to make is always this cheap political plan to say Jesus is a socialist and you say well why do you think that because I saw a meme about it on Reddit one time say okay can you explain can you give any example of Jesus being a socialist and they never can so I think the people who are saying Jesus is a Palestinian look just to use the phrase Jesus was is if you do that enough times you're kind of showing your cards because the for those of us who believe in Jesus Jesus is before Abraham was he is but but also they just haven't read the Bible you know it's all the people who tend to preach the most about these things politically did tend to have never cracked the spine of a Bible so I would just laugh at them they're gonna come up with some new one when there's a new political issue as well hi Michael do you believe in the deep state and if so what do you think about it and how do you think it's affecting our government and democracy from Caleb okay he didn't put his name up down yeah by definition the deep state exists cuz the deep state is the entrenched federal bureaucracy that is unaccountable to voters and that can't be moved along by elections so that does exist I don't think it's like men twirling their moustaches in a bunker for the most part there are those types I mean there are those guys you know like some some of the FBI guys Peter struck you know actually when he was testifying before Congress he did look like a villain from a James Bond movie but most of them are just bureaucrats who who are so entrenched in the government is so bloated and big and powerful and unaccountable that elections don't matter because the elected officials come and go but those bureaucrats live forever you know bureaucrats have come closest to finding the Philosopher's Stone and immortality on earth as virtually impossible to fire them James o keeffe's videos quoted a bunch of DOJ officials saying that we can't lose our jobs so that does exist in the way to fight that is to shrink the size of the federal bureaucracy the Trump administration has done a beautiful job at that before they finally claimed scott pruett before they finally threw him out of office he was doing an excellent job cutting the size of the EPA and hopefully we'll be able to continue that because bureaucracies are natural going to do this I don't even ascribe ascribe ill intention to a lot of these people it just naturally happens and the only way to stop that is to shrink it keep it small and keep the government accountable from aslam Michael I've found debating points with the left is becoming far more taxing because they're so entrenched how do you pick and choose your battles especially with people you respect as a friend esslyn well Kanye West is a good example of this Kanye West you know he came out he he gave his political opinion which all of his friends disagree with and they they tried to guilt him they tried to shame him they say your fans don't want this you're you're ill I'm worried about you but the racism you said you can throw out all the slogans you wants not gonna change my mind I would say two things I'm friends with a lot of Democrats you know I've lived in New York and LA and went to a very left-wing school if I were not friends with Democrats I wouldn't have that many friends one thing I always try to do with them is I never back down I never try to play nice and conciliatory and don't rock the boat I am I will exaggerate my political views if anything with some of them because you don't want them to bully you into going along and agreeing with that if they're not gonna like you because of your political point of view you don't want to be friends with them anyway that said though I don't poke them I don't prod them I don't talk about politics all the time if they bring something up I'll double down they say oh you know Trump Trump called stormy Daniels horseface say I know it was so rude to mr. ed to compare her to to miss it to horses you know is so rude to all those horses and then maybe they can back off it or something always you know double down don't let anything go unanswered but you don't need to poke them all the time because why are you friends with them you're presumably friends with them because you share some points of view you share some values you share some activities together you like them and so you don't want a problem you don't dislike them but never back down never back down no the real way is don't pick any battles to begin with if a battle is picked with you though you fight it right back from Augusta or Augustine Mike my very liberal economics teacher says the Trump tax cuts are awesome in the short run but not great in the long run due to problems and the large debt that large debt can cause down the and the tax cuts do not really help that issue how do I respond to this MDG oh well first of all to quote famous liberal economist John Maynard Keynes in the long run we're all dead no they're great in the short run and they're great in the long run and the dead is a problem all of those things can be true your teacher is right that the debt is a major problem not a problem from merrily caused by the Republicans by the way the the debt and deficit under Barack Obama expanded dramatically you had regular trillion dollar deficits and and President Trump has not tackled that problem yet the main response I would say is that tax cuts don't cause the debt entitlements cause the debt entitlements are the majority of the federal budget they cause the debt they are the main driver of the debt they are insolvent they will make the debt worse and the deficits worse if they are not checked it is Democrats who are not allowing us to address those entitlement programs Medicare Medicaid Social Security which will bankrupt the country and won't be there for the young workers who are paying into it right now tax cuts don't do that tax cuts let people keep a little bit more of their own money that's fine that's perfectly fine and they can stimulate economic growth if people are serious about taking on the debt you're not gonna do it by raising taxes because that also could damage the economy you're not gonna do it with pork barrel spending that's another favorite buzzword of the left and the right you're not gonna do it by eliminating some bridge projects somewhere or whatever you're going to do it by tackling the lion's share of our budget and the main driver of debt and that's entitlement programs show me someone who has the guts to deal with entitlement programs other than Paul Ryan who is at now has had his career basically finished in the Congress show me someone with that courage and I'll vote for that person but I don't I don't see it anytime soon time for one more all right time for one more from L on should we believe all men if gender equality is our goal Thanks what a great question to end on you know just wow we should believe all women and because women are equal to men we should believe all men and therefore we shouldn't believe all women and we shouldn't believe all men we should believe credible people and give the accused the presumption of innocence until they're proven guilty wow man that is some poetry I'm gonna have to tweet that out okay that's our show we're gonna be back tomorrow for a Friday show because I ditched you on Tuesday to go give a speech so
