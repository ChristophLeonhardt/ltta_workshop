it will probably get dinged if we do is that good hey everyone I'm Alicia crowd Michael Nolt and this is what I say together yes ah damn it can I get a do-over live from New York that would be kind of fun to say one of these days I don't think either of us will ever be rich enough or famous enough to do that although frankly I think that this Facebook stream gets more views than Saturday night oh that's nice and then you would be married to an a-lister what is it with the SNL cast like always dating hot celebrity a list actresses now it's the true perversion of Hollywood that they would be attracted to those misfits so speaking of attractiveness of Hollywood one of the things that we talked about was you know beauty last week and the beauty positivity and the body shaming industry and everything with Lena Dunham that was upset that her sweatshirt that was supposed to be throwing the trolls was put on like a size two Victoria Secret model we had an interesting mix our question was do you think the body positivity movement is good or bad for women and we had a really interesting mix people on YouTube do not care our YouTube commenters we're like whatever next question next topic we do not give a rip but our Facebook commenters were really passionate about this and they said they actually think it is incredibly hurtful for women it's hurtful because it's saying be unhealthy and ruin your health and be fat I think I think that that was the the thing that they say it's women already have enough issues with their body but you shouldn't have them be either extreme right that that's such a good point yeah because it is I see both arguments right you want to be nice do you don't want to make fun of people for how they look you also don't want to encourage people to be unhealthy but isn't the answer just like stop thinking about your body so much stop it stop it Lina but it's hard to do that as a woman when that is like all you see and hear from everything you're talking about it puts you look good what are you talking about our culture like that after 90 minutes and hair and makeup let's be honest I mean I'm just saying he also takes in I mean I do I do not want to see him this is not a lot of positivity going on when I wake up in the morning she also wears man spank I do a lot you know I actually joking aside I actually did a commercial for spanks one time I loved it go looking for that internet go trick good luck on that one and send it to me - mwah at Alicia Krauts please I'd be amazing so Halloween is coming soon got some skulls and stuff on my jacket today I'm very I'm a full family costume fan I've got my rachel maddow costume but I don't but I don't know that I would dress my daughters in this mmm sexy Handmaid's Tale we have a picture of it YUM and that it is from a website that I think is known for their kind of sexy Halloween attire isn't this the antithesis of him still I love it you know it's so I always love when reality punches lefties in the face yeah and so their whole thing is we're Trump's America I mean I have to wear potato sacks they you know all this and then the version of that that they actually get is this like super sexy long slip form-fitting because it's because it's American you can do whatever you want it is like a miniskirt yeah with a bonnet yeah and a cape I could get into that I'm a commander I've never read the book I've never watched the show I just know that it's the end of the world and Cavanagh also net neutrality also Donald Trump were all stacks yeah right getting a tax cut is the end of them all of these things we're handmaids to ever me and all the other women apparently I have to tell you with Handmaid's Tale I mean it is maybe the stupidest thing I've ever watched love it love it it is such trash oh you just want to shovel trash into your brain that's the one to watch no that's what I watch The Bachelor for I've never watched an episode of bachelor that was life but that is why I watch Lifetime movie sometimes so next topic my favorite woman like she might be up there with nikki Haley y'all so you know I'm for serious about this because nikki Haley is my fave like love her dearly wanted to be her BFF this pistol-packin granny down in Texas she's terrific being an Okie at heart I hate that this is a lady in Texas but that's okay we will set aside a great granny we will set aside the Red River Rivalry to couldn't like this lady is amazing not only is she a great granny not only does she own a miniature horse farm yes many horses ready she waited patiently before hunting down like a 12-foot / 500-pound Gator 585 gator that had previously killed a mini horse of hers not yesterday not a week ago years ago you're the man who shot my paw yeah and even better she's a politician she's the mayor of her town she's the mayor of hers right this woman I love it too because your it sounds like a Florida story you know Florida maker yeah anchor Florida but it's in Texas and you know so she did it with one shot by the way which is pretty impressive she goes out there where they're gun blasts this 580 pound Peter yeah and then even just that you think that is a magnificent story but then when you find out her reasoning which is that it ate her mini horse you just think like oh I really don't understand any of America okay there is there is a country within this country that I just have nothing no common experience coastal person I know that you're not a liberal given that you are such like in New York LA coastal person I know I got to go just start slaughtering some Gators though I really understand I showed this picture to my five-year-old and she said how'd it die and I said that old lady killed it and she said why I said because it ate a mini horse and she went good and then I gave myself a mom pat on the back because I was like parenting win that's great and then I said mommy will teach you how to do that one day I'll teach you to kill the Gator that's our mini horse it's yourself a gate I mean hashtag goals right yeah that's true also then that Gator it's huge you know how many bags you can get out of that sucker well also it's kind of like the turducken like you can eat the the good that the Gator Horsham or something both of those things I've eaten horse and I've eaten Gator before and neither of them are good Gator is better than horse Gator tasted like chicken yeah it was fine horse is like the worst beef jerky ever I had it on a pizza in Italy really mmm that's a story for another day all right final topic are you excited that LeBron James is not only trying to be like Michael Jordan on the basketball court playing sports ball or whatever it is that he does yeah he's also going to try to emulate and become Michael Jordan on the big screen yes because they're doing a Space Jam remain base jam - Wow I did a remake or sequel oh it's gonna be a sequel oh yeah okay so we discussed yesterday you know that Michael Jordan is making like a cameo yes you have to yes but the real thing is who are gonna be the Monstars mm remember who was it in the 90s it was like all of the all-star players that's right and they came and they the aliens took over their body and then they were playing the Looney Tunes and Michael Jordan and then that's how that happened yes I'm so you know you got you have the Monstars oh yeah oh wow this is that's a great life today would it be like Kevin Durant Russell Westbrook mm-hmm James Harden Kobe Bryant but he's retired Kobe's an Academy Award winner he'll be very hard to get him in that movie who would another one he only does he was only gonna do like The Pianist tune oh there you go there's your Monstars mm-hmm right Steph Curry Kevin Durant Russell Westbrook James Harden and like can I tell you something great I don't know who is single one of those people isn't the only reason I know three of them were previously with the Oklahoma Thunder okay I'm from Oklahoma and it's the only protein we have so everyone knew everyone who got us to like what think we went to the quarterfinals in 2020 everyone had thunder gear everyone Wow and so that's really and I was heartbroken actually when a couple of those players left the Thunder cuz I was like traitors you we're traitors why not Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner's were the most famous athlete in the world it has to be a basketball player in order for the monster but maybe Caitlyn can identify as a basketball player I don't you think though you know she she used to be a yeah she identifies the best she's gonna live the rest of her life as a basketball you would you ever identify as a basketball player I would do my best but I don't think I'd be very convincing so I I you have my guesses for the new Monstars who the Monstars would be I'm pulling for Kaitlyn that's what I want yeah that is our question of the week who do you think should be casted in the Space Jam sequel as the Monstars this time around and I'm I really hope that this turns out I feel like I need to watch the original one with the kids and then maybe you go see the new one in theaters but I hope it works out I'm totally gonna see it I I'd you know I don't see kids movies i don't like i don't watch pixar or anything oh for sure watch face Jim -
