00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:00,900
COMMITTEE.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,502
NEXT STOP, A FULL SENATE

3
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,839
CONFIRMATION VOTE AS EARLY AS

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,273
TOMORROW.

5
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:07,574
BRET?

6
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,308
>> Bret: PETER DOOCY, LIVE ON

7
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:09,442
THE HILL.

8
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,578
LET'S GET MORE NOW FROM OKLAHOMA

9
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:12,345
SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD WHO SITS

10
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,481
ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IN

11
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,649
THE SENATE.

12
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,284
SENATOR, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

13
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,353
YOU ARE ASSESSMENT OF THIS

14
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,955
REPORT THAT CAME OUT OF YOUR

15
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,957
COMMITTEE TODAY, I HAD LOT OF

16
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,227
RIGHT UP SAYING, IT GOES REALLY

17
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,462
AGAINST THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON

18
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,430
THIS VERY TOPIC.

19
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,631
>> Senator Lankford: IT'S AN

20
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:32,631
INTERESTING SPIN TO SAY IT GOES

21
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:33,700
AGAINST THE HOUSE COMMITTEE.

22
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,068
ALL WE DID WAS LOOK AT THE

23
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:35,702
ASSESSMENT FROM THE OBAMA

24
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,270
ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY DID IN

25
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,272
DECEMBER, LITERALLY THE FINAL

26
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,673
MONTH FOR THE PRESIDENT.

27
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,175
HE PUT OUT A QUICK RUN THROUGH

28
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,476
OF WHAT INTELLIGENCE THEY HAD AT

29
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:44,944
THAT POINT, WE LOOKED AT IT AND

30
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,346
EVALUATED WHAT THEY HAD AT THAT

31
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,781
POINT INSIDE A "YES," THAT'S

32
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,049
WHAT THEY HAD.

33
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,451
THEY EVALUATED IT AND SET FOR

34
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,253
THE RUSSIANS TRYING TO HELP

35
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,454
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE END?

36
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,054
YES.

37
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,856
THE BIGGER QUESTION WAS NOT OUT

38
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:57,857
THERE, WHERE THEY ALWAYS TRYING

39
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,859
TO HELP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN?

40
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:00,126
NO.

41
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,594
THAT'S NOT IN THE REPORT.

42
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,263
THE RUSSIAN STARTED WORKING ON

43
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,164
CAMPAIGN ISSUES IN THE

44
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,466
UNITED STATES IN 2014, THEY

45
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,467
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE CANDIDATES

46
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,535
AT THAT POINT.

47
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:09,302
THEY WERE DETERMINED TO FIND

48
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,303
SOME WAY TO MEDDLE IN THE

49
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,605
CAMPAIGN AND WORKED FOR MULTIPLE

50
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:13,740
CAMPAIGNS THROUGHOUT THE

51
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,073
PROCESS.

52
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:15,642
SO THAT WAS THROUGH THE FINAL

53
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,109
MONTHS.

54
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,977
WERE THEY TRYING TO ENGAGE WITH

55
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,078
AND THE FINAL MONTHS?

56
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:19,379
SURE.

57
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,515
WERE THEY IN THERE THE WHOLE

58
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,317
CAMPAIGN, NO THEY WERE NOT.

59
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,486
>> Bret: HERE IS THUS IN A

60
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,454
MINORITY REPORT ABOUT THAT

61
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:29,389
TRUMP TOWER MEETING.

62
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,658
>> SENATE REPUBLICANS

63
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,126
INTERVIEWED ONLY 12 WITNESSES IN

64
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,260
TOTAL.

65
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,128
AN INFAMOUS KREMLIN CONNECTED

66
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,163
LAWYER WAS ALLOWED TO PROVIDE

67
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:38,064
ONLY WRITTEN ANSWERS.

68
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,867
OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS DECIDED

69
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,269
NOT TO EVEN INTERVIEW TWO OF THE

70
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,471
OTHER KEY PARTICIPANTS IN    IN

71
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:45,505
OTHER KEY PARTICIPANTS IN    INH

72
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:45,738
OTHER KEY PARTICIPANTS IN    INE

73
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:46,072
MEETING.

74
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,542
JARED KUSHNER, AND PAUL

75
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:49,909
MANAFORT.

76
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,445
TO CALL THE SENATE JUDICIARY

77
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,646
COMMITTEES TRUMP RUSSIA

78
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,481
INVESTIGATION HALF-HEARTED IS

79
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:56,783
TOO GENEROUS.

80
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,384
>> Bret: YOUR THOUGHTS?

81
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,320
>> Senator Lankford: THAT IS A

82
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,387
SAD DESIGNATION OF WHAT HAPPENED

83
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,056
IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY.

84
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,724
HE KNOWS FULL WELL THAT THE

85
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:05,859
SENATE JUDICIARY AND SENATE

86
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,293
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS GONE

87
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:07,727
THROUGH THIS.

88
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,062
I KNOW DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO

89
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,363
MAKE SOMETHING OF THIS BUT THIS

90
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,265
IS A RABBIT HOLE FOR THEM.

91
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,099
THEY ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO

92
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,467
ACCUSE AND SAYING THERE MUST BE

93
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,869
SOMETHING HERE THAT WE CAN STIR

94
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,337
UP OR AT LEAST CREATE AN

95
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,504
ACCUSATION THAT HAS THE

96
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:19,105
APPEARANCE OF IT.

97
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,540
WE INTERVIEWED EVERYONE WITH

98
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,708
THAT WAS THERE AND WENT THROUGH

99
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,775
ALL THE DOCUMENTS.

100
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,576
EVERYONE'S STORY HAS BEEN

101
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:24,244
CONSISTENT AND THERE WAS NO

102
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,179
COLLUSION THAT WAS PART OF THAT

103
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:26,713
MEETING.

104
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,181
IT WAS A DECEPTIVE REACH OUT

105
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,516
FROM AN INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY HAD

106
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:32,919
CONNECTED TO DURING ONE OF THE

107
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,553
PAGEANTS.

108
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,821
IT WAS A MUSIC PERSONALITY THAT

109
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,055
THEY MET WITH AS A PERSONAL

110
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:36,356
FAVOR.

111
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,157
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH ALL THE

112
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:40,093
INTERVIEWS, IT'S OBVIOUS THERE'S

113
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,128
NOTHING THERE AND THERE IS NO

114
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:42,762
REASON EVEN FOR THEM TO GO

115
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:43,162
THROUGH IT.

116
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,097
MY FEAR IS THAT DEMOCRATS

117
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:44,864
CONTINUE TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT

118
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,032
OF NOTHING AND IF YOU LOOK AT

119
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:46,966
THE FACTS INCLUDING ALL THE

120
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,501
TESTIMONY TODAY, YOU WILL SEE

121
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,670
THERE WAS NOTHING TO THAT

122
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,838
MEETING.

123
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,006
>> Bret: WHERE DOES THIS GO

124
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:53,640
NEXT?

125
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,908
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE WAITING FOR THE

126
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,542
NEXT SHOE TO DROP WITH A BOB

127
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:57,810
MUELLER INVESTIGATION BUT WHERE

128
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,647
DOES THIS ALL GO NEXT?

129
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,482
>> Senator Lankford: THE HOUSE

130
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,216
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE RELEASES

131
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,684
THE REPORT AND WE RELEASED THE

132
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,486
SECOND PART OF OUR REPORT IN THE

133
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,454
DAYS AHEAD.

134
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,657
WE ARE TRYING TO GET OUT OF THAT

135
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,125
AS WELL AND WE ARE WRAPPING UP

136
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,860
OUR REPORTS AND TRYING TO GET

137
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,061
THROUGH ALL THE FINAL DOCUMENTS.

138
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,063
OUR HOPE IS THAT THE MOLAR

139
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:17,864
INVESTIGATION IS ALSO DRAWING TO

140
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,667
A CLOSE TO BE ABLE TO FINISH OUT

141
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,901
THEIR INVESTIGATION.

142
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,637
MY FEAR IS IF YOU GO BACK TO

143
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,471
IRAN-CONTRA AND INVESTIGATIONS

144
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,873
DONE BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL AND

145
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,774
PRESIDENT REAGAN, THAT WAS SIX

146
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:28,875
YEARS THEY DRUGGED THAT OUT.

147
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,677
WE WANT TO HAVE THEM DO THEIR

148
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,879
WORK, FINISH THEIR WORK AND BE

149
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,347
ABLE TO GET IT DONE.

150
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,515
>> Bret: WHAT ABOUT THE

151
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,382
CONCERN THAT RUSSIA IS GOING TO

152
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,986
DO IT AGAIN IN THE MIDTERMS OR

153
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:40,286
2020?

154
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,020
>> Senator Lankford: WE SHOULD

155
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,322
BE AWARE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD,

156
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,123
RUSSIA WILL TRY SOMETHING AGAIN.

157
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,525
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EUROPEAN

158
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,126
COUNTRIES FACE EVERY SINGLE YEAR

159
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,962
AND WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES

160
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:49,929
FACE MULTIPLE TIMES.

161
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,465
I ASSUME IF THEY DO IT ONCE THEY

162
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,766
WILL WILL DO IT AGAIN.

163
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:54,467
IT WILL JUST NEED TO BE AWARE

164
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,201
THAT IF THEY SEE THINGS ON

165
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,036
SOCIAL MEDIA, THAT'S NOT ALWAYS

166
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:57,770
AN AMERICAN TRYING TO PUT OUT

167
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,039
INFORMATION ON EITHER SIDE OF AN

168
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,873
ISSUE.

169
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:01,975
AMERICANS ARE FREQUENTLY SEEING

170
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,143
SOCIAL MEDIA AND ASSUMING IT'S A

171
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,245
FELLOW CITIZEN, AND IT'S NOT.

172
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:07,146
>> Bret: THERE OBVIOUSLY A LOT

173
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:07,880
OF DEMOCRATS AND SOME OTHERS

174
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,050
THAT SAY THEY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH

175
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,686
WHAT THEY SAW FROM

176
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,554
DONALD TRUMP JR. IN THE

177
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,221
COMMITTEE, AND AS THE TRANSCRIPT

178
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,458
OF THE INTERVIEWS ARE BEING

179
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,058
RELEASED, HERE IS

180
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,426
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL ON ALL OF

181
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,961
THAT AND WHAT HE'S GOING

182
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:22,295
FORWARD.

183
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,932
>> HE NEEDS TO COME BACK AND

184
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,935
TESTIFY IN PERSON UNDER OATH.

185
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,839
THERE IS A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE

186
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,539
EXPLAINED, THE CONTRADICTIONS

187
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,641
ARE APPARENT ON THE RECORD, BUT

188
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:39,746
EVEN MORE SO WHEN I ATTENDED

189
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,449
THIS INTERVIEW.

190
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,653
I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE THAT HE HAS

191
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:47,954
THAT.

192
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,857
>> Bret: DO YOU THINK HE NEEDS

193
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:51,524
TO COME BACK?

194
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,191
>> Senator Lankford: I DON'T

195
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,461
THINK HE NEEDS TO COME BACK.

196
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,295
HE'S APPEARED BEFORE THE SENATE

197
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,263
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, HE'S DONE

198
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,965
HOURS AND HOURS OF TESTIMONY AND

199
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,466
THAT HAS BEEN CONSISTENT.

200
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,635
THEY ARE JUST DIGGING AND HOPING

201
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,270
THEY CAN FIND SOMETHING OR LEAVE

202
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,538
AND INNUENDO, THAT MAYBE THERE

203
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,340
IS A SECRET QUESTION THEY CAN

204
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,474
ASK TO FIND SOMETHING.

205
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,876
THE HARD PART IS AFTER MONTHS

206
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:10,676
AND MONTHS OF THIS

207
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:11,377
INVESTIGATION, THEY ARE NOT

208
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,179
FINDING ANYTHING.

209
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:21,254
MAYBE I COULD BRING HIM BACK ONE

210
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:21,754
MORE TIME, I WILL.

211
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:22,355
BUT IT'S JUST NOT THERE.

212
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,089
>> Bret: RUDY GIULIANI HAS

213
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,224
SAID THAT MUELLER HAS TOLD HIM

214
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,659
THAT HE WILL ADHERE TO THE

215
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,261
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE, AND

216
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,631
THERE WILL NOT BE AN INDICTMENT

217
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,665
OF THE PRESIDENT.

218
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,332
>> Senator Lankford: QUITE

219
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,401
FRANKLY, THAT'S THE SAME THING

220
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,204
THAT JIM COMEY TOLD THE

221
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:38,571
PRESIDENT.

222
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,573
HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT OUT THREE

223
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,041
TIMES IN THEIR MEETINGS.

224
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,444
EITHER THAT HAS COME UP, OR THEY

225
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,344
HAVE BOTH SAID THAT OVER AND

226
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,479
OVER AGAIN.

227
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,047
SO I WOULD BE SURPRISED BY THAT

228
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,183
BUT I DIDN'T HEAR IT FIRSTHAND

229
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,684
THAT THERE WASN'T GOING TO BE AN

230
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,585
INDICTMENT, BUT THAT WOULDN'T

231
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,220
SURPRISE ME AS THAT HASN'T BEEN

232
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,254
THE CENTER OF THE INVESTIGATION

233
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,556
NOR HAS THE ROLE OF THE SPECIAL

234
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,458
COUNSEL TO TRY TO GET AN

235
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,258
INDICTMENT BY THE PRESIDENT.

236
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,693
HIS ROLE WAS VERY CLEAR TO SEE

237
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,595
IF THERE WAS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY

238
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,496
AMONGST THE CAMPAIGN.

239
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,964
THE PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN

240
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,899
LISTED AS THE SOURCE OF THIS

241
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,468
ACTIVITY, OR THAT THESE

242
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,669
ACTIVITIES EVEN EXISTED.

243
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,070
HE WAS DOING RESEARCH TO SEE IF

244
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,072
ANYTHING DID OCCUR.

245
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:13,806
TO BE ONE LAST THING, HOW LONG

246
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,208
DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO

247
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,443
TAKE BEFORE WE KNOW A CONCLUSION

248
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,978
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER?

249
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:19,679
>> Senator Lankford: THE NEXT

250
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,880
FEW MONTHS, THE SENATE

251
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,948
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WILL WRAP

252
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,249
UP YOUR WORK AND GET THEIR

253
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:23,883
INFORMATION OUT THERE SO

254
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,885
EVERYONE CAN SEE IT AND AS MUCH

255
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,587
POSSIBLE DETAIL AS WE CAN GET

256
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,921
OUT IN CLASSIFIED FORM.

257
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,256
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

258
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,891
IS ALREADY WRAPPING UP AND WE

259
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,592
WOULD HOPE THE SPECIAL COUNSEL

260
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,293
WILL DO THE SAME.

261
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,361
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T CONTROL

262
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,130
SPECIAL COUNSEL, WE ARE

263
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,830
INDEPENDENT OF US BUT WE HAVE

264
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:48,741
GONE THROUGH A LOT

265
00:06:53,846 --> 00:00:00,000
INDEPENDENT OF US BUT WE HAVE
GONE THROUGH A LOT OF INTERVIEWS
