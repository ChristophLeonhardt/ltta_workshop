whiskey is a global term and whiskey can be produced in any country when you call yourself a whiskey all that means is that you take grain and you for a minute then you distill it and then you put it into a barrel to material that's the common definition that ties Scotch whisky to Japanese whiskey to Irish whiskey to bourbon whiskey Scotch whisky can only be made in Scotland if you call yourself bourbon whiskey you can't be proofs just anywhere you have to come from the United States you can't just use any grain but you have to be at least 51% corn and most importantly if you call yourself bourbon whiskey you cannot reuse barrels you have to use only new charred oak barrels what I love about bourbon whiskies in Tennessee whiskies is that they're all-natural everything in the bottle is going to come from water grains and barrel the color is all natural all the flavors natural not every whisky is all-natural some of them use sugars and colors and things of that nature they're allowed to but we don't you can make bourbon in Hawaii if you want a whole corn over there it just has to be a product of the United States first is what we call the native spirit only about 40 percent of what we've produced for Jack Daniels is consumed within the United States 60% of it goes to the rest of the world so we're proud to be a top 10 export product from the state of Tennessee and probably its best-known export product today
