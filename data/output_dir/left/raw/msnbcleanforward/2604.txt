ONE OTHER THING ABOUT IT, I GREW UP IN LOS ANGELES AND, HUGE

140
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:08,540

00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:53,689
IMMIGRATION. AS IF HE WAS STILL TRYING TO

337
00:09:53,732 --> 00:09:54,690
AS IF HE WAS STILL TRYING TO PROVE HIMSELF TO THE CROWD.

IS WHY YOU ELECTED ME. THIS IS WHY I’VE BEEN SAYING,

THIS IS WHY I’VE BEEN SAYING, THIS IS A GOOD ISSUE FOR

343
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:03,632
THIS IS A GOOD ISSUE FOR REPUBLICANS THIS FALL.

344
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:05,200
REPUBLICANS THIS FALL. AS POORLY AS THAT POLLS.

345
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:07,436
AS POORLY AS THAT POLLS. BUT THAT’S WHAT HIS INSTINCT IS

346
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:07,803
BUT THAT’S WHAT HIS INSTINCT IS SAYING.

349
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,474

350
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:14,309
THIS IS STILL WHO HE IS. HE GETS, IT’S A RARE REVERSAL

351
00:10:14,353 --> 00:10:16,144
HE GETS, IT’S A RARE REVERSAL FOR THIS PRESIDENT TO BACK DOWN

352
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:17,513
FOR THIS PRESIDENT TO BACK DOWN ON ANYTHING, PARTICULARLY WITH

353
00:10:17,556 --> 00:10:17,913
ON ANYTHING, PARTICULARLY WITH IMMIGRATION.

354
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:19,281
IMMIGRATION. WE SAW IT THIS WEEK, NOT FOR A

355
00:10:19,324 --> 00:10:21,717
WE SAW IT THIS WEEK, NOT FOR A MORAL REASON, BUT BECAUSE THE PR

356
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,118
MORAL REASON, BUT BECAUSE THE PR WAS SO BAD.

357
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:25,020

KRIFRTSEN KRISTEN NIELSON, IVANKA TRUMP

371
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:57,619
KRISTEN NIELSON, IVANKA TRUMP AND STEPHEN MILLER, HOW COULD

372
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,255
AND STEPHEN MILLER, HOW COULD THEY BE REMEMBERED AS ANYTHING

THEY BE REMEMBERED AS ANYTHING BUT PEOPLE WHO PUT FORWARD AN

374
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,258
BUT PEOPLE WHO PUT FORWARD AN UNAMERICAN CRUEL POLICY THAT WAS

375
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:04,860
UNAMERICAN CRUEL POLICY THAT WAS ABUSIVE TO SMALL CHILDREN?

376
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:07,696
ABUSIVE TO SMALL CHILDREN? >> I MEAN I THINK THAT OVERALL

377
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,366
>> I MEAN I THINK THAT OVERALL THIS IS, IS A WHITE HOUSE THAT

380
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:15,904
ON DONALD TRUMP’S VERSION OF POLICY AND DONALD TRUMP’S

381
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:16,872
POLICY AND DONALD TRUMP’S VERSION OF IMMIGRATION.

382
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:21,210
VERSION OF IMMIGRATION. SO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE, I THINK

383
00:11:21,254 --> 00:11:22,578
SO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE, I THINK DO HAVE THEIR OWN BELIEFS IN

384
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,547
DO HAVE THEIR OWN BELIEFS IN THIS POLICY AND THE IDEA THAT

385
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:25,248
THIS POLICY AND THE IDEA THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP PUTS FORWARD.

386
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:28,684
PRESIDENT TRUMP PUTS FORWARD. I THINK IT’S CLEAR THAT THE

387
00:11:28,728 --> 00:11:30,686
I THINK IT’S CLEAR THAT THE PRESIDENT, SOMEONE SAID THIS

388
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:32,054
PRESIDENT, SOMEONE SAID THIS PRESIDENT IS NOW REIGNITING WHAT

389
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:34,390
PRESIDENT IS NOW REIGNITING WHAT HE SAID WHEN HE KICKED OFF HIS

390
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:36,158
HE SAID WHEN HE KICKED OFF HIS CAMPAIGN, I VENTURE TO SAY HE

391
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:37,393
CAMPAIGN, I VENTURE TO SAY HE NEVER LET THAT GO.

392
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:39,028
NEVER LET THAT GO. HE HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED THAT WAY,

393
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,496
HE HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED THAT WAY, HE’S ALWAYS TALKED THAT WAY,

394
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:41,897
HE’S ALWAYS TALKED THAT WAY, HE’S ALWAYS SURROUNDED HIMSELF

395
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:42,799
HE’S ALWAYS SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT

396
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,400
WITH PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THERE’S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE

397
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:45,735
THERE’S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF STEPHEN MILLER AND

398
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:46,402
INFLUENCE OF STEPHEN MILLER AND STEVE BANNON.

399
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:47,403
STEVE BANNON. BUT THEY WEREN’T STANDING NEXT

400
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:49,805
BUT THEY WEREN’T STANDING NEXT TO HIM WHEN HE LAUNCHED HIS

401
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:51,007
TO HIM WHEN HE LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN CALLING MEXICANS

402
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:51,908
CAMPAIGN CALLING MEXICANS RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS.

403
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:53,543
RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS. I THINK THE PEOPLE SURROUNDING

404
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:54,410
I THINK THE PEOPLE SURROUNDING DONALD TRUMP ARE JUST

405
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,112
DONALD TRUMP ARE JUST INFLUENCING HIM IN A WAY THAT’S

406
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:57,280
INFLUENCING HIM IN A WAY THAT’S REALLY LIKE DOUBLING DOWN ON

407
00:11:57,323 --> 00:11:58,581
REALLY LIKE DOUBLING DOWN ON WITH A HE ALREADY BELIEVES.

408
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,116
WITH A HE ALREADY BELIEVES. I THINK I WANT TO ADD, WHEN I

409
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,986
I THINK I WANT TO ADD, WHEN I WAS IN MINNESOTA, THERE’S THIS

410
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:04,220
WAS IN MINNESOTA, THERE’S THIS IDEA THAT ALL OF THESE OFFICIALS

411
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:06,055
IDEA THAT ALL OF THESE OFFICIALS ARE ABLE TO SAY ONE THING AND

412
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:08,324
ARE ABLE TO SAY ONE THING AND SWITCH IT OFF QUICKLY.

413
00:12:08,368 --> 00:12:10,059
SWITCH IT OFF QUICKLY. THE SUPPORTERS OF DONALD TRUMP

414
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:12,128
THE SUPPORTERS OF DONALD TRUMP BELIEVE IN HIS ALTERNATIVE

415
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:12,428
BELIEVE IN HIS ALTERNATIVE FACTS.

416
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:13,530
FACTS. THE PEOPLE THAT I TALK TO, WHEN

417
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,765
THE PEOPLE THAT I TALK TO, WHEN I WAS TRYING TO ASK HIM ABOUT

418
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:17,534
I WAS TRYING TO ASK HIM ABOUT THE POLICY, THEY WERE

419
00:12:17,544 --> 00:12:18,234
THE POLICY, THEY WERE REGURGITATING EVERYTHING FROM

420
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:19,302
REGURGITATING EVERYTHING FROM DONALD TRUMP’S TWEETS, THEY SAY

421
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:21,237
DONALD TRUMP’S TWEETS, THEY SAY WE LOVE THE FACT THAT HE’S

422
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:22,105
WE LOVE THE FACT THAT HE’S TWEETING AND SPEAKING DIRECTLY

423
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:23,039
TWEETING AND SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO US.

424
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:24,674
TO US. SO WHEN WE CAN PLAY THESE VIDEOS

425
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:26,242
SO WHEN WE CAN PLAY THESE VIDEOS OF JEFF SESSIONS SAYING ONE

426
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:27,944
OF JEFF SESSIONS SAYING ONE THING AND SAYING ANOTHER.

427
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:29,779
THING AND SAYING ANOTHER. BUT HIS SUPPORTERS BELIEVE HIM,

428
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,614
BUT HIS SUPPORTERS BELIEVE HIM, THEY BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT

429
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,748
THEY BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT HE’S TWEETING AND AS A RESULT

430
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,283
HE’S TWEETING AND AS A RESULT THAT’S WHY THE MEDIA REPORTING

431
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:34,617
THAT’S WHY THE MEDIA REPORTING DOESN’T REALLY GET THROUGH IN

432
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,719
DOESN’T REALLY GET THROUGH IN THE SAME WAY.

433
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:38,255
