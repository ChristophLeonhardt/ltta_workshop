right now is Governor John Kasich of Ohio governor what do you make of what you saw today in Helsinki Chris unbelievable right I mean so sad I did some interviews earlier and look you and I come from the same stock and we've never seen an American president do this stand on a stage with a Russian former KGB and kind of compare our intelligence community to the Russians and all this has been said it's it's a sad day and Chris though you know the one thing that I kind of as I sit here and reflect and listen to all this this is not a time for Democrats and Republicans to start you know i-told-you-so or any of those other things this is a time for Republicans and Democrats to adopt a traditional model which is the strong America belief and our allies the critical importance of the Western ethic and perhaps there's some things that Congress can begin to do perhaps Republicans who now are starting to become critical you know that they begin to speak out they begin to take control I was in Washington last week talking about my great concern about the fraying of the relationship the g7 NATO the fact that these things have gone very poorly nobody said anything about it and you know when you don't say something about the g7 and then you head to NATO and that was a bumbled meeting as well nobody said anything so where's the surprise here that he would go and ad-lib all this it's just a sad day for a country and I'll bet they're trying to figure out how to put the toothpaste back in the tube but I just hope the damage can be repaired governor what's in it for the president politically I mean he's a politician and you're a politician but I it's hard for me to see the win here why does he want to look like he's surrendering to Putin's world view the Putin's Woodward taking him at his word when he's a KGB professional intelligence officer of the worst kind who knows how to lie right to your face why is he saying I believe the guy or I believe him as much as I believe my Director of National Intelligence dan coates why would he say what do you say about that how do you get him to stop doing it Chris I I don't know maybe it's because people around him have not spoken directly to him you know there's a problem with all leaders CEOs you know big-time leaders that there's a sense that underlings cannot talk honestly to a leader and you know you you know about 13 days when Kennedy said they had groupthink when everybody thought the same and how dangerous that is nobody is intervening no one is saying enough is enough and so I don't I don't understand it Chris I can't figure out why they didn't step up and correct some of the things that he's doing you don't do it in public you do it in private it's it's it's pretty astounding and we hear it across the board here's the real interesting question what is the Republican base going to say now we had a county chairman here in Ohio and a little Township or a county called Belmont County who said said today I've had enough and he's resigned but where's the bass going to be are people just gonna look the other way because now we're talking about critical issues that affect the future of our country and the future of the Western alliance well here's a hero for you Senator John McCain had very strong words for the president after what happened at Helsinki today quote today's press conference in Helsinki it is a John McCain was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory the damage inflicted by president Trump's naivete egotism false equivalence and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate but it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake your thoughts on that on John McCain well I mean Chris you know you and I love John McCain he's we don't care what party he's in he's a bit it's it's sad that his voice has been somewhat muted that means others have to speak up and you know sometimes you got to start you're gonna alone you know I was at the Press Club last week talking about my concerns I've been doing it now for almost two years right as you know I didn't go to the convention I didn't endorse because I was worried about these kinds of things happening I don't I don't want it I don't want to be in a position to say I saw this because I was hoping that there that none of this was going to happen all I'm asking for are my colleagues to begin to stand up and be heard on trade on NATO more than just passing some non-binding resolutions start taking some action because it's our country and the sacrifices that so many people have made to preserve the liberty and the spirit of America well let's talk about that because the Republicans that I am impressed by almost all of them from Charlie dent a John McCain to Jeff Flake all across the country but the only voices are those who are not going to face Republican voters again in all likelihood will you face the Republican voters and run for president against Trump I don't know Chris I mean I don't know what's going to happen here I don't know where the base is I don't want to be an election I can't win I don't know all of my options are on the table they remain on the table but what's important Chris is that we start getting some Republicans to emerge there just can't be a few of us there has to be a greater group who begins to assert themselves because as we know foreign policy love of our country at its best is bipartisan so some of the Democrat leaders that want to take shots why don't you just shut up and begin to work with some Republicans and let's be united as a country not practicing partisan politics either way either side right well with the lip-syncing and he'll sink he's not going to do it I can't think what will but senator congressman you governor John page my friend thank you so much governor for being a strong player tonight hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if
