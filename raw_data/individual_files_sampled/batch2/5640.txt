day 4:17 of the Trump administration and by one measure the whole investigation appears to be over the news was so big the president switched to all capital letters tonight to say this the House Intelligence Committee has after a 14 month long in-depth investigation found no evidence of collusion or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election in fact there it is on the summary of the investigation quote we have found no evidence of collusion coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians they go on to dispute our own intelligence agencies findings that Russia indeed developed a preference for then candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign so those are all accurate depictions there except this wasn't the finding of the House Intelligence Committee tonight what the president wrote about in all capital letters was about something from the Republicans on the committee they didn't consult or tip off the Democrats that they were shutting this down the investigation goes on of course in a number of other different forms Muller chief among them but the Democrats were fuming tonight the lead Democrat on the now-closed investigation Adam Schiff of California put it this way this evening by ending its oversight role in the only authorized investigation in the house the majority has placed the interests of protecting the president over protecting the country and history will judge its actions harshly Schiff also offered this sharp criticism of his GOP colleagues while speaking with our own Rachel Maddow tonight I think many of us could see that Donald Trump was going to be a very poor president what we couldn't see is how many people would be complicit in that how many people would be willing to resign their obligations under the Constitution and our system of checks and balances in this service of that deeply flawed president our Constitution is only as good as the people who uphold it and by shutting down this investigation it shows that the people upholding it are really not living up to their responsibilities and Congressman Mike Conaway who has been leading the investigation since last spring addressed Democratic criticism tonight appearing on Fox News it's not surprising that folks who disagree who wanted to continue this investigation there may be someone the Democrat has said that never what this kind of conclusion because they since it has some sort of advantage to them to keep these keep this wound open we believe it's important to move forward we've got elections coming up the primary season has already started now we've got important things to discuss with Mexican people about protecting our electric process meanwhile as the house investigation comes to an end we are learning new details about Robert Muller's wide-ranging Russia investigation that has dominated the news cycle in recent weeks bloomberg reports it this way today special counsel Robert Mullins investigation into whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice is said to be close to completion but he may set it aside while he finishes other key parts of his probe such as possible collusion and the hacking of Democrats according to current and former US officials that's because Muller may calculate that if he tries to bring charges in the obstruction case the part that may hit closest to trump personally witnesses may become less cooperative in other parts of the probe or the president may move to shut it down altogether on that front we are also hearing from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein tonight he is offering support for the special counsel as the president continues to trash this investigation overall as a witch-hunt Rosenstein in a rare interview told USA Today quote the special counsel is not an unguided missile I don't believe there is any justification at this point for terminating the special counsel the deputy AG's comments come after this weekend report from the New York Times that said the president is in discussions with a veteran lawyer who represented Bill Clinton during the impeachment process about joining the White House to help deal with the Muller investigation let's bring in our leadoff panel for a Monday night talk about all of it Julia Ainsley spec with this NBC News national security and justice reporter as is Robert Costa national political reporter for the walk post and moderator of Washington week on PBS and Jill wine banks returns former assistant Watergate Special Counsel welcome to you all Julia you are batting lead tonight why did this happen why did the Republicans on this committee want to pull the ripcord right I think to an extent this was expected we know that this has been a largely partisan investigation by the house this is the same committee that put out the Nunez memo trying to discredit the whole Russia investigation saying that it was all based on the flimsy dossier and they admitted a lot of key details that really underpinned the reason why this needs to be brought to the federal level of investigation but I think that they went even further than a lot of people were expecting and that they went up against the findings of the Intelligence Committee say they tell its community so I saying that it was actually not Russian preference at all for Trump that maybe they medals but that there clearly wasn't any case of them having a clear preference for the Republican candidate the intelligence community has said that there was a clear preference here that when Russians got involved in the election when they wanted to medal that clearly try to discredit the Democrat Hillary Clinton and try to show a preference to Donald Trump so they're going up against them here and then the fact that they cut the Democrats out of course really undermines it but it's still important I don't think that you know we need to ride too much into their decision but it's important to think about the fact that the majority party in the House wants to dismiss this and pick siding with the boss with the president over fuller investigation over questioning witnesses more completely because that would be the body Brian where you would have to bring an impeachment trial and if we come to that point with this probe and the Republicans in the house don't think that this is anything but a witch-hunt they could block those efforts well Robert this next question is for all of us who grew up in a household where we used to hear this is why we can't have nice things let's lay it out here this was the least of the investigations that were going on but the way they have behaved and the way they have handled this what to do about putting our trust in this Committee of the house that deals with our secrets as a nation the next time we seriously have to deal with our secrets as a nation well voters will certainly evaluate them this fall but we also all grew up in homes Brian where college football may have been popular I went to Notre Dame rooted for the Irish and in college football there are many polls that sometimes used to determine national champions but there was only really one poll that matter The Associated Press poll when you look at this investigation yes these congressional committees matter yes they're making conclusions about the the Russia the whole Russia experience but the the probe that really matters is the Justice Department the special counsel so while the Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Intelligence Committee are coming up to their various conclusions what matter is it smaller and his indictments and the voters well they may have a political cost they'll put on the Republicans for how they've handled this Russia probe but at this moment Muller he keeps an eye on what people are saying to the House committees and to the Senate committees but he's not worried about it because he has grand juries going on at this moment all right well a subset of that question Robert can this be revived if in November the voters decide it's gonna be chairman Schiff and control the house flips to the Dems you're not gonna see these kind of private investigations going on it like we've seen on Capitol Hill in recent months where we have all these people you see the camera shot when they walk in Cory Lewandowski or Sam number but you if the Democrats take over the house they tell me they're going to have public hearings of Trump administration officials White House officials campaign officials so the public can see up close what these people are saying on the record under oath Jill how can you conduct a proper investigation now that it's over we can talk about it in the rearview mirror without calling forward manna fort gates Papadopoulos or flynn or the president there are so many things missing from this investigation that it is absurd to call it over and the only explanation for saying that has to be Hardison and the only thing I would quit within what Julia said because I agree with everything she said except that when she said it was largely partisan it is totally partisan there has been no bipartisanship in this investigation and that is a big difference from what we had during Watergate where we operated as prosecutors side by side with the Senate who operated in a totally bipartisan way where the Democrats and the Republicans had a public hearing the American people were able to see what was happening to understand the witnesses to understand the evidence and there was legislation that came out of it that tried to solve the problems that had been part been the cause of Watergate and here I don't see a real urge to solve the problems and protect us we have an election tomorrow in Pennsylvania but we have a big election for the midterms and we need to solve this problem and Congress is the one who has to do it and public hearings would certainly be a good way to go about it hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or
