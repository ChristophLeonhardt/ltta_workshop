00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
hey guys soon yesterday's video I

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,790
mentioned that I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> friends</font>

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,110
and my mother was really genuinely

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,279
concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that she don't quite</font>

5
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,319
pick up sarcasm she very sweetly sent me

6
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:08,790
an email that was like of course your

7
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,110
friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> your lovely friends what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

8
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,550
talking about like what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you</font>

9
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sometimes my British</font>

10
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,210
sarcasm falls flat against you know the

11
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,980
Mexican barrier but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah of course I do</font>

12
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,150
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends and I'd like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce</font>

13
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,859
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one of those friends today his</font>

14
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,550
name is Hercules and he lives right here

15
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">mmm disgusting facial features of sight</font>

16
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,330
today's mission was to see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> long you</font>

17
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,220
can go without talking try having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font>

18
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,019
of a silent time when you'd usually be

19
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,430
chattering away or if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling</font>

20
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,140
ambitious you could attempt a whole day

21
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,149
of not speaking practically the second

22
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,100
option just wasn't an option three I had

23
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,420
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor's appointment I had to get in</font>

24
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,739
your neighbors and even though it's been

25
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,239
a couple of years since I turned 18 I

26
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,410
keep forgetting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't get</font>

27
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,270
prescriptions free I went to boots to

28
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,530
get my<font color="#CCCCCC"> haters and they were like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it gay</font>

29
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,789
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be seven pounds for</font>

30
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">tears like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I think that rigidly</font>

31
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,360
unfair I can't help what my lungs were

32
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,920
like when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was born I can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

33
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,809
fact that we live<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a polluted world I</font>

34
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,300
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay for din healers and</font>

35
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,309
then in the afternoon I had a meeting

36
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,050
with my dissertation supervisor and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

37
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,699
other people for whom he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

38
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">dissertation supervisor yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> llo was</font>

39
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,710
definitely more like a him talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

40
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,299
our situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't you know an</font>

41
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,920
opportunity to just like zip it

42
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,060
completely but it's been a time in

43
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,010
between his team meetings fairly silent

44
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,420
and I also spent that time in a coffee

45
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,220
shop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am a curious person anyway so</font>

46
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,840
I do eat stew up a lot that the

47
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,250
eavesdropping was even more<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused</font>

48
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,750
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I was so aware of you know</font>

49
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,280
not talking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not thinking about</font>

50
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking and not you know chattering away</font>

51
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,700
to people I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was by myself anyway so</font>

52
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,200
folks after the way it would be to

53
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,729
myself would you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pretend I'm not</font>

54
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">crazy even if it's not true to make up</font>

55
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,360
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking i did stands considering</font>

56
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,619
making this into a silent film

57
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do recommend it was written 1989 it's</font>

58
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,150
only 100 pages or so and draws parallels

59
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,680
between the development of war

60
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,750
technology and the development<font color="#E5E5E5"> of camera</font>

61
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,130
technology and the more we strive to

62
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,750
perceive something perfectly with

63
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,430
there's more distance between it with

64
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,140
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reflecting mirrors and digital</font>

65
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,000
and all that stuff it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just interesting</font>

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,500
and I said the last thing I'm going to

67
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,850
say is that someone on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter and drew</font>

68
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,830
chalky pointing me towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian Cox's</font>

69
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,180
night with the Stars which out on the

70
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,190
BBC and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quantum theory</font>

71
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,170
squashed into like an hour I found it

72
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,700
brilliant he's very clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i don't</font>

73
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,110
find him patronizing that's the one

74
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,220
thing that's put me off sides in the

75
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,170
past like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> being patronizing not</font>

76
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,090
taking the time to explain and be clear

77
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,980
and and not assuming that everyone's

78
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,660
mind works the same way so yeah it's

79
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,860
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna put more information about</font>

80
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,390
and description bar below thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

81
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">Andrey for that it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

82
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,120
watch it cool to mild look things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

83
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,740
learned at secondary school level but it

84
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,690
obviously push them farther and and it

85
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,430
it made them seem more collected and a

86
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,380
hole in the idea of like quantum theory

87
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,580
and quantum mechanics in general

88
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,230
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is getting more sciency by a</font>

89
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,060
day it's terrified so to conclude the

90
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,770
silences<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my day just involved a lot</font>

91
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,900
of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know eavesdropping the actual</font>

92
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,340
last thing before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I finish this video</font>

93
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,380
there was some donkeys on campus today I

94
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,970
saw them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the morning and then by the</font>

95
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,770
time I put back my video camera to film

96
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,270
them in the afternoon so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could show</font>

97
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,520
you guys donkeys were gone so<font color="#E5E5E5"> either I</font>

98
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,140
made them up or there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some donkeys</font>

99
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,510
roaming free around the campus only<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

100
00:02:59,510 --> 00:00:00,000
she'll tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> buh-bye</font>
