“Mom and Dad moved
from the farm in 1985."
“It has been empty since then.
Yeah.
That’s a long time.
If they had sold the farm and
we went back and drove by it,
I don’t know how I’d feel.
There would still be
a sense of possession
because it was
part of your life.
Not that you would own
it, but you would still
feel that it shaped you."
“It would be really
hard to give up.
Very, very hard.
One of the favorite
places is the front step,
sitting there talking
to Mom and Dad.
Talking to my sister, talking
to friends, pet the cat.
Yeah.
That’s one of my
favorite places I think.
Mom’s ashes — we
sprinkled some ashes
there because of
all the chats."
“I think Dad was one of
those lucky people who
was born in a place he
really was happy to be.
And I don’t know if
everybody gets that in life.
He loved prairies.
He loved the farm.
As he got older, I
think he recognized
he really loved us a lot too.
The farm was very important.
It was very important to him.
We were important, but I think
he just kind of relied on Mom
to deal with raising us."
“I think he thought
he had to be stern.
And as he aged, he learned
that didn’t have to be so."
“After Mom died I went to
the post office in town.
And the gal who
works there said,
‘I’m so sorry about your mom.’
She said, ‘When I first
moved to this town
your mom was one of the
first people who spoke to me
and made me feel welcome.’
Then she said, ‘Your
mom was so direct.’
Yeah.
My heart was
breaking at the time,
but I kept thinking
don’t forget that word.
Direct, direct, direct.
“Mom WAS so direct! And
it was one of the most
delightful things about her."
“I could ramble on
about them, but that
summarizes some of it.
In my mind I always thought,
maybe we would go back.
But when you’re
younger you always
think you could do everything.
You really could
do everything.
You could live in Europe for
a while and have a house here.
Time doesn’t work
out that way."
“And a 16-hour drive
is a long ways to go.
Doesn’t fit in the same
way that it used to."
“I miss the solitude,
being able to see the sky.
I miss the weather.
Not that it’s all good, but
when you live with no wind
you miss it."
“The sound of the
cows calling."
“I miss friends.
Lots of laughter.
When it was really cold
the telephone wires —
they sang.
It was a beautiful
resonant sound.
And there was that
long-distance sound of a car
way far away and then it
coming closer, and closer,
and closer, and closer.
And then, whoosh.
And then that disappear.
And on a long
weekend Mom would
be like, ‘Oh, the traffic.
Oh, the traffic.’"
“Mom said sell it.
I remember her saying that.
Get it cleaned up.
That was the way she operated.
And Dad’s was a
little more veiled
in that he said, ‘They’re
not making any more land.’
And you kind of drew
from that maybe you
should keep it for a while.
Our wild and crazy hope is
that somebody from the family
said I’d like to go and
live in Saskatchewan."
“I think for a
long time you’re
comfortable not
thinking about it,
and then you start to realize
that you will have to make
decisions about things —
about possessions,
about objects.
But there’s a certain
amount of excitement
about the concept
of saving something.
When you go there there’s this
sense of situational bearing
that always feels stable.
The sky looks the
same and the land
looks the same because
the contours don’t change.
But everything’s
a little rougher.
Everything’s a little worn.
Certain things
are disappearing.
When we go home we
go to the cemetery.
You just walk around
and you remember people.
It’s a comfort.
And sometimes when I’m
here walking with the dog,
and the moon is
out here, I think
it’s shining on them too."
