a fiery exchange between Deputy Attorney General rod Rosenstein and Ohio's Republican Congressman Jim Jordan now yesterday in the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee chaired by Bob Goodlatte there were many many moments where you wanted to bang your fist on the table or break something noodle rod Rosenstein Deputy Attorney General and FBI director Christopher Ray's arrogance their pompous attitude but none none infuriated me more than the exchange between Rosenstein and Ohio congressman Jim Jordan that Jim Jordan has been an absolute rockstar and he went back and forth with Rosenstein a Rosenstein 'z body language to me said he was being deceptive do I am I in the man's head do I know if he was lying no I personally do not believe that rod Rosenstein was being honest and truthful I personally my opinion based on training and experience as a police officer and how to detect deception I personally believe that rod Rosenstein was being very deceptive his body language he had a dry mouth his eyes were furtively moving back and forth his face got very red he began to get angry all signs of what somebody caught in a lie caught in a trap do again my opinion based on my observation there was one instance where I think Congress might have on the record caught Rosenstein in a lie a minor one maybe an even unintended or inadvertent one but because that doesn't seem to matter to guys like Rosenstein and Muller they prosecute people for that stuff anyway why not have it come back and bite them as well but let me give you a few bits of the exchange if he didn't watch it did Jordan said well I think in a few minutes the House of Representatives is gonna go on the record saying you have not complied with requests from a separate equal branch of government the executive and the legislature roses they mean part of the executive the legislature legislative Congress of course being the other equal branch of government that you haven't complied with subpoenas that you got and you got seven days to get your act together and I don't know why you won't give us what we asked for Rosen theme said sir I so certainly that your colleagues are not under that impression it is not accurate sir Gordon shot right back it is accurate we have caught you hiding information and this is when Rosen's team got read safe and really angry he said now mr. Jordan I'm the Deputy Attorney General United States I am NOT the person doing the redacting I am responsible for responding to your concerns as I am I have a team with me sir a fraction of the team that is doing this work and whenever you brought these issues to my attention I have taken appropriate steps to remedy them your statement that I am personally keeping information from you trying to conceal information Jordan cut him off and appropriately properly spot-on said you're the boss mr. Rosenstein and then they went back and forth now Rosenstein is the boss it is not credible not believable that rod Rosenstein would allow memos to go to congress redacted but he didn't look at because if he's allowing that and those things shouldn't have been redacted he shouldn't be the Deputy Attorney General but here's the exchange where I think rod Rosenstein might have lied Jim Jordan said he was talking about the stories first told by representative Matt gates that Rosen's team threatened congressional staffers they press too hard did you threaten to subpoena phones and emails Jordan as Rosenstein Rosenstein said no sir there's no way to subpoena phone calls and his his staffers laughed and that's where I think he was caught in the lie how you why we all knew America knew the committee knew everybody knew and I'm gonna read something to you from 27-year FBI agent everybody knew that what Rosenstein meant but what what Jordan meant was phone call logs when you say I'm gonna subpoena their phone calls that's what Jordan meant Rosenstein said you can't do it and he lied he lied let me read you a tweet from Bobby Chacon you've seen Bobby on the show Bobby is a unfortunately now my machine is moving very very slowly so I'm gonna try to do this from my phone but let me read you a tweet from Bobby Chacon who like I said has been with the FBI for 27 years and a good friend of mine I've had him on the show off and here it is Bobby wrote on Twitter to my critiquing Rosen's line Bobby wrote Bobby Chacon FBI 27 years I personally subpoenaed hundreds maybe thousands of phone calls I would get lists of dates times numbers called duration of call and more info those were all phone call and I got that info via administrative subpoena in my title 21 cases Rosenstein lied to Congress by saying you can't subpoena phone calls when Jim Jordan clearly meant the details of the phone calls not the actual phone calls because we know we don't have time machines we can't go back in time and listen to the phone call be a subpoena so any the FBI and DOJ love this right reasonable person reasonable prosecutor wouldn't know exactly what Jim Jordan meant by Rosenstein saying under oath we can't subpoena phone calls to me was a lie under oath the Congress his exact quote no sir and there's no way to subpoena phone calls that's either a lie to Congress or an indication an admission by the Deputy Attorney General of the United States that he's so ignorant of his own Title 18 and 21 procedures that he doesn't know you can subpoena phone calls one is criminal one is fireable now do I think Rosen Stein was being snarky and being just trying to be a wiseass I do but it doesn't matter because he and Muller would have prosecuted somebody for false statements under oath for doing exactly the same thing and they should be prosecuted for things like this Rosen Stein should be criminally referred by the House Judiciary Committee to Jeff Sessions are useless AG he'll do nothing but at least get it on the record that Congress is not gonna tolerate snark when the Department of Justice is stonewalling and obstructing engaging what I believe is the worst cover-up in American political history this is really important content got me all fired up and I really want to bring it to you every day and I'm gonna be doing that in a new format my live show Declassified live starting Monday morning 7:30 a.m. Eastern you're gonna be able to interact with me I meet your questions boom it's gonna be on YouTube I'm gonna interact with you I'm gonna answer your questions in real time check it out check out my Twitter at John Cardillo I'm gonna be setting out a blast a series of tweets starting today and over the weekend details about the show what we're gonna be doing it's gonna be awesome I want you to be there I want you to be there with me every morning at 7:30 and you get into work or in the car with somebody and they're driving and you're bored put it on your phone you're getting the questions back and forth together don't do it when you're driving though bad idea bad idea mass transit thanks so much for watching you guys have a great weekend I'll see you live Monday morning
