I say Merry Christmas and God bless you I strongly support president Trump our troops in ironclad borders and I stand for our National Anthem if any of this offends you then I'm not your guy that was Brian Kemp he's George's Secretary of State and he's the Republican candidate for governor there in other words he's currently overseeing the election he's trying to win and now he's being sued by a coalition of civil rights groups who say the method his office uses to verify new voter registration is discriminatory here's how the Washington Post describes it quote the exact match law requires election officials to flag and pause any voter registration application if the identifying information does it precisely match the voters information in existing records even because of something as small as a missing - or a transpose number although voters are not barred from casting a ballot they must take extra steps to verify their identities but take a look at who this is really affecting an investigation by the AP found there currently more than 53,000 applications currently on hold at Kemps office and 70% 70% of those belong to African Americans Georgia's population is about 32% black Kemp's opponent Stacey Abrams is demanding that Kemp resigned from his post as Secretary of State but time is running short Georgia's deadline to registers Tuesday the midterms are in 25 days and they're locked out in a tight race Abramson Kemp are statistically tied right now according to a poll released yesterday the panel still here Rep this seems like it's not even voter suppression disguised as something else no this is blatant I mean first of all you should never have the Secretary of State who's over the voting process remain in office in any election that he's in but on top of that for to have this guy can't decide on how they're going to put quote on hold peoples registration that's the term they're using and then 70% of them are black that was researched by Associated Press not up one of the civil rights groups none of the plaintiffs this is this is independently by Associated Press on top of that to have Kemp in charge of the process I mean it is why why wouldn't he recuse himself I mean the only reason you wouldn't recused yourself is because you want to have this advantage and you want to be blatantly out there saying I'm going to do what I want even if we have to change the rules even DeSantis in Florida said I'm going to leave what I'm doing in Congress and run for governor against Gilliam and Florida this guy Kemp has not even done that when he is directly involved in the voting process so he would I mean Jim Crow would blush if he would see this guy killed it seems to me that we talk so much about the Trump effect one of the effects of Trump seems to be this disregard for we don't know that he broke the law but this disregard for the norms you're talking what I mean the norm is if you're the secretary of state and you are running you would recuse yourself perhaps from that election yeah and he's not and he's decided a couple of months ago and not with this but with closing of the polls and he lost there so it's been a constant thing with camp and he's not stopping and the race is really close I mean Stacey Abrams could potentially become the first black woman elected to governor in a in a southern state which just goes plays into the new South that we've been hearing about but I do want to step back for a second this voter suppression has been going on across the country since the since 2013 when the Voting Rights Act was gutted and we saw this in 2016 as well in in North Carolina even in Wisconsin there were voters who were disenfranchised and they were people of color and so this is this is a new play by Republicans since 2013 and it's unfortunately very successful the one thing that was really great to see is in Alabama Alabama had a voter ID horrible voter ID law but they they came they got over it right you got 98 percent of women who came black women who came out and voted and they were able to educate people and let people know this is what you do if you if you're turned away to vote soon sometimes I lie in bed at night trying to decide if the Trump administration is more sinister or more incompetent and I and I and I and I wrestle with it until I fall asleep I never really land on an answer but it would appear that Trump and Derrick Kushner are trying to have a position on criminal justice reform they're trying to get into trying to play in that space if you will it would seem that having someone running under the banners a Republican operationalizing the disenfranchisement of what 70,000 African American voters would be in direct contradiction to his efforts to play in the space of criminal justice reform the white house could easily do something they could call this guy he mentions the president in his ad why doesn't the White House call him and say back off well let me relieve you of your burden would you go to sleep next time you can say that it's both incompetent and sinister thank you I don't think you have to choose between the two you know I think where they are on prison reform is largely driven by Jared Kushner being outraged about how his father was treated Margaret apart it's a very narrow space of this you know in both voter suppression and this isn't just voter suppression this is racially charged voter suppression and gerrymandering you had the 21st century sort of undoing the 20th century's efforts to get rid of all of these heinous abuses of the 18th and 19th century and I think that Donald Trump is opened the door to people being comfortable wearing racially charged Massa nations or raw racism on their sleeve because of the way he responded to Charlottesville because of his own history in New York and elsewhere of using race as a very divisive tool and this for self-aggrandizement so other members of the GOP see that and and to me this isn't even about partisan politics these issues or ideology it's about who we are as a country and what's a civilized way to discuss these issues and the extent to which Trump personally and the people around them just torn that up hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click
