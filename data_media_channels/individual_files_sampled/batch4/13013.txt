President Trump wants Hillary to run again me too and speaking of hashtag me too we'll discuss the me to meme and have saccharine slacktivism hurts real victims then we'll be joined by possibly the first Democrat ever to grace the michael knowles show couch to run down the latest list of left wing talking points finally Ariel Davidson and His Eminence Paul Bois joined the panel of deplorable z' to talk America's quiet victory over Isis John McCain's spurious spurious nationalism and California's official third gender that's what I am I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Knowles show we have got so much to talk about today obviously we have our first Democrat in studio I guess there's Dave Rubin but I read somewhere that Dave is a Nazi all right er so I'm just gonna take that at face value certainly the the first elected Democrat that we have in studio we'll get to him and ask him which a chapter of my book was his favorite but let's start with I think the second most cough F a press conference in history the first of course was when President Reagan fired all of the air-traffic controllers this one was very close president Trump yesterday Hillary please run again look when they take a knee there's plenty of time to do knees and there's plenty of time to do lots of other things but when you take a knee sheet well that's why she lost the election I mean honestly it's that thinking that is the reason she lost the election when you go down and take a knee or any other way you're sitting essentially for our great national anthem you're disrespecting our flag and you're disrespecting our country and the NFL should have suspended some of these players for one game not fire him suspended him for one game and then if they did it again it could have been two games in three games and then for the season you wouldn't have people disrespecting our country right now and if Hillary Clinton actually made the statement that in a forum sitting down during the playing of our great national anthem is not disrespectful then I fully understand why she didn't win I know I I mean I mean look there are a lot of reasons he didn't win including the fact that she was not good at what you did but I will tell you that is something that I had just heard about and I think that I think that her statement in itself is very disrespectful to our country I love him so much I can't get over it he this is why we elected this guy I sometimes worry that people who aren't from New York don't even appreciate this stuff as much as I do he he actually set this up by the way he tweeted out he said some people want Hillary to run again please Hillary run again so he sets it up at this press conference they asked the question and he knocks it out of the park please Hillary run again and he brushes her off says well this is why there are times to kneel there are times not to kneel and and I know it seems like a throwaway statement what he's saying is I'm not an ideologue I am NOT a rationalist I'm not an ideologue I simply have a view of respecting the country I have a traditional view traditionalist view in some ways of America and you got to respect the country I don't you don't need to be fired maybe you get suspended for one game maybe two games I don't know and then to say I see why Hillary lost well there are a lot of reasons why Hillary lost but that's one of them it's just he's unrelenting he never stops I mean this is this is what we elected this is what we've been waiting for on the Republican side for a long time is a guy who will make it will just stand firm against this cultural onslaught from the mainstream media and from the entertainment complex he'll just stand firm and say no no I'm pretty sure that's why Hillary lost now I think I'm gonna respect the flag great stuff excellent press conference very very cafe I agree with him of course he wants Hillary won me too speaking of me too we talked about this a little yesterday Alyssa Milano sent out a tweet which launched this huge social media campaign it's all over Facebook and Twitter she said and this is in response to the Harvey Weinstein scandal it turns out he raped like every aspiring actress in all of Hollywood and this is a widespread problem in Hollywood for a very long time now it's all coming to light people are talking about the horrific incidents that have happened to them and she tweeted out and said if you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write me too as a reply to this tweet there's the problem this there are a few problems with the slacktivism with this hashtag activism but the first is in her launching it she says if you've been sexually assaulted or harassed those are categorically different things those are categorically different they're both bad we should stop both I suppose one is a is a heinous crime one is a assaulting somebody's sold as well as their body violating their liberty and the other is being rude and untoward and you know maybe the guy at the office winks at his secretary that's all terrible too quite different than rape and to conflate those two is offensive and disrespectful toward the victims of actual rape now a men are virtue signaling back because that's how the internet works with the hashtags hashtag I will and hashtag how I will change so here are just a few of them hashtag I will promote women's voices believe survivors and work to end rape culture and purity culture two sides of the same patriarchal coin how I will change I will listen to women more closely seeking to understand before seeking to be understood then if it helps I will act I will listen more learn more acknowledge more in support more I'm willing to have more courageous conversations or use those courageous words how courageous how I will change means acknowledging my own capacity for harmful behavior and taking responsibility for unlearning that toxicity I don't really take issue with the premise here that men can be dogs and they should behave themselves I take issue with the supposed surprise the shock the earnestness of the tweeters I think it's mostly feigned I think it's fake but some might be real because these people are utopians and they think that mankind can be perfected with just a few more regulations a little less freedom a little more effort that isn't going to happen and living in delusion will help nobody so let's dispel some of the delusion around this we begin with the courageous conversations what is courageous about echoing the dominant cultural meme what is courageous about saying you're always right I'm always wrong whatever the left tells us is true even if the statistics are spurious that's true I'll believe anything there isn't a rape culture in the United States that was one of the allegations there was a rape culture there was no rape culture in the United States rape happens this is because we're fallen people and crime happens and murder happens and awful things happen and will always happen because we're not going back to the Garden of Eden this is an earthly paradise and human nature isn't perfectible that's going to happen but you know the rape culture is this Pakistan that's a rape a culture that institutionalizes and through its own cultural mores creates venues in which rape is approved of that is a rape culture there is no approval of rape in the United States the to tweet a trending hashtag alleging rape culture undermines the rape culture right it undermines your own claim it's a defeater for your ridiculous argument the the hashtags too are empty virtue signaling it is saccharine it is it is it's slacktivism that accomplishes nothing it reminds me of I don't know if people remember this Kony 2012 did you remember in in 2011 or 2012 there is this I remember Michael do you remember this it was everywhere Kony 2012 he was some warlord in Uganda and some filmmaker said we're gonna stop Kony this year and then every little dummy on Twitter and Facebook posted about it and they felt they were doing something they felt they were accomplishing something they accomplished nothing he's still at large it's it is a useless it is to make yourself feel good to give the impression of doing something it I've heard this described about smoking cigars and I will acknowledge it the nice thing about smoking is you feel like you're doing something but you're really just sitting down and not doing anything that's slacktivism Michelle Obama did that she held up a sign when those girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram in Nigeria the sign said no joke hashtag bringbackourgirls that's the Sun this is the courageous piece of paper or hashtag your husband is the president of United States if you want to bring back the girls you can bring back the girls now perhaps the issue isn't as calm as simple as all of that perhaps there are geopolitics at play that complicate things don't pretend that your hashtag is doing anything it's accomplishing absolutely nothing also don't tweet about it if you're a guy don't tweet I will I'm with you I these guys these like fake feminists sensitive earnest nice guys they're like the creepiest guys around do not but they are creeps I would not let my fiance near any of them they are get women do not believe them the feminist men protest too much methinks next if you've been raped go to the police go to the police do not go to your professor do not go to your administrator on campus do not pass go do not collect $200 it is a serious crime it is possibly the most serious crime if it has happened make sure that it is prosecuted to the full extent of the law we have a system for prosecuting crimes it's called the criminal justice system it's not the sort of crime to be dealt with by campus tribunals this leads into another aspect though we have a criminal justice system to protect the rights of the accusers but also to protect the rights of the accused so the people who have had a crime committed against them and also those of a accuse of doing it these campus tribunals have been absolutely demolishing the due process rights of the accused in in countless cases but a lot of the tweets that have been coming with I will or I you know this is what I will do they say that will always believe of people who allege that they have been raped Hillary Clinton said this during the campaign which is quite ironic because she smeared the people who alleged rape against her own husband someone might ask why would anyone make up a rape why would anyone allege that they've been raped if they haven't I don't know it's pretty weird man but it does happen in just the last eight years there have been five instances five major instances of this presumably many others there was obviously the Rolling Stone UVA rape hoax this was a major story in Rolling Stone a girl alleged she had been gang-raped at a fraternity it didn't happen the story absolutely fell apart they had to retract the whole thing at UC Santa Cruz a few years ago a girl paid someone on Craigslist to beat her up and then she alleged that she had been raped that also fell apart in 2013 a University of Wyoming student posted a rape threat against herself in a campus Facebook group that also was uncovered but not before it caused a lot of anxiety to the campus community a lot of other people 2009 a hospice Hofstra student had consensual sex with five guys at once her boyfriend found out and said you look like you've just had sex with a lot of guys and she said I've been raped he said go to the police she said no that I don't need to and then they went to the police anyway they arrested these guys they threw them in jail only because there happened to be a video of this event why don't want to know what were these guys let off the hook for it because it the video showed that it was consensual but nevertheless the allegation was made it could have ruined these guys lives in 2013 a University of Florida student falsely claims she was raped in a parking lot then she said it was false but intended to show a greater truth so she it was a complete lie but then it was the lie was meant to serve the greater truth and then later she admitted it's because her parents were pressuring her to graduate from college and she probably wasn't going to do that conservative columnist George Will was accused of not taking rape seriously in a letter by four Democratic senators because he made these exact same points and he responded in exactly the right way he said he said he takes a sexual assault and rape much more seriously than they do you know some would prefer it if professors and campus tribunals dealt with this crime some would prefer it if judges juries and executioner's dealt with it the the we in the latter category are taking this issue much more seriously and the people who are engaging in frivolous slacktivism are doing nothing but hurting a very serious issue all right on that note now that we've covered the gamut from silly Trump conferences to rape let's bring on our guest today we have four term California Assemblyman Mike Gatto Mike thank you for being here it's great to be here now you have the distinct privilege maybe the distinct terror and disadvantage of being the first Democrat politician to ever come on our show so thank you for making me either either very brave or very stupid that's right well that'll be left for the audience to judge I guess I have a hunch of which one it is my first question for you obviously you and I have a lot in common you're a Democrat politician I am the best-selling author of reasons to vote for Democrats a comprehensive guide which which was the most compelling chapter in my book did you think well so I have to ask you has anyone ever gotten a copy of your book and oh my gosh is blank this there there have been a few people who were nice once my I wanted to sort of ad-lib that I wanted you to give me a comment is oh my gosh oh my god well I did this copy using you you can put it in you put it in your office you know right next to all of the great political philosophers there is a professor I know who at the end of every semester he asks his students about reading that he assigned that he never assigned and sees who is the greatest bs artist so I was gonna say then I guess page 117 is the reason why I'm well I'm really thank you so much it's I appreciate your reading it even just right now because I do appreciate that you're willing to come on and talk to Republicans right now the parties are so completely polarized that people aren't willing to do that you're one of the few I don't want to say you're reasonable I think that would be going way too far and maybe I'll call you semi-reasonable so we probably agree on a great many things I want to ignore those completely and only talk about what we disagree on sure there are a lot of Democratic talking points that are going around now that I think are bunk I think there's a lot of Democratic politicians think they're bunk - can we go through a few of these and maybe happier this all right by the way the dialogue reason is the whole reason I'm here I think it's so important right now that you know I mean everybody knows how polarize this country is but I think it's more important than ever that we talk that the two sides talk it is it is impressive that you're you're doing that because I talk about this sometimes on the show I think there were two kinds of debate their debates were you score points and you just yeah I got my point and haha I've smacked you down and then there but I don't get anything out of that I don't in any way benefit from that but there are debates where even rarely I'll change my mind you know I was pro-abortion I was pro-choice I had lunch with a bioethicists a mana show up by the end and a lunch of his pro-life a rare occasion but people can change their minds with discuss things first question first talking point did el Presidente the Donald himself did President Trump sheet Hillary Clinton out of the presidency so I think if you read the the more sensible articles on this you will find out that President Putin wants the American public to believe that this happened he wants the American public to lose faith in our elections he wants the American public to to think that he is that powerful and more importantly he wants Russians to believe that he is so powerful that he's pulling the strings in the biggest superpower on earth I think there's a real danger with that narrative because our elections at risk yeah I've been a i've been somebody who's raised this issue that we have to be careful about voting machines we have to be careful about vote-by-mail ballots people can take them and happens all the time happen in Hollywood in a very very recent election but this idea that our entire democracy has our entire Republican form of government has been hacked or or stolen by the Russians is so detrimental to people having faith in the system that's that is such a mature analysis of it because I think I even know Democrats on the grassroots level and members of my family friends of mine who say it Putin is controlling the government and Donald Trump is a Manchurian Kami ridiculous things right Donald Trump the guy we've known for 40 years is really a secret plant of KGB operative Vladimir Putin yeah he's got a hard time controlling his own country I mean I you know when these rumors started going out there I mean he was sort of that danger of there being another type of orange revolution or people you know a real strong alternative coming forth and so you know I mean he spread these I think he's been active in spreading these rumors of course and that that there I think is the fake news right people allege the fake news I pride myself on being a strictly fake news program but that there is the fake news right now I don't think anyone is under the misconception that Vladimir Putin is a benevolent forest he loves the United States he wants to do as well but clearly he's caused some chaos even by crafting the narrative that he's caused some chaos and probably right the New York Times suggested that Donald Trump did not pay income taxes for two decades this was blown up by my twin sister Rachel Maddow we have evidence that he did pay they tried this on Mitt Romney said that Mitt Romney didn't pay his income taxes I promise you they'll try it on the next Republican nominee does an attack like that does it work does it hold any water does it work in the other direction probably not Republicans are the greedy awful capitalists why does that attack why does that stick around well I think that first of all people are justifiably upset because there's a huge gap between the rich and the poor in this country right now and I think we really run the risk of being sort of the opposite of what the founding fathers wanted which was a country of Galit arianism where everybody is more or less equal and has a not equal opportunity that being said people probably don't understand the the arcane tax code I don't understand our arcane tax code my taxes in a decade well I certainly don't do although I hope you pay taxes on that mic is pointing out my lovely $400 check from mr. ben shapiro i confirm he did not pay taxes on the people the california government I promise you they don't watch my show and I Ben did ask because this is the original check he said oh great you didn't catch the check and I said no no there's this wonderful thing called mobile deposit so I get to cash a check and I get to frame and get it on my show but but what happened I mean obviously on people in real estate like like our president um you know it if you have one year where you have one huge loss you can carry forward that loss you're 10 years 20 years indefinitely so I'm guessing what happened I mean he should release his tax returns we'd probably know but I'm guessing what happened is he had one year where he lost a ton of money and he's carried forward those losses for all these years and he probably hasn't paid much taxes because of those losses so we know at least 10 years later we know in because that was what my sister Rachel Maddow released he paid 38 million dollars of taxes in ten years so I'm sure yeah he had a 95 he had a huge loss I assume he wrote off those losses as well he should but he didn't write off for 20 years at least right you know and the question you bring up is you know there's this big gap between the rich and the poor the middle class is shrunk and there's a widening gap I'm not in the upper 1% even with my blank book I mean I didn't five percent but why do I care if some guy gets really rich why do I care I have a girl I have an unbelievable standard of living I'm in the top probably tenth of a percent of the world wealth and income let me give you two reasons why you should care so first of all our country was founded on the idea that there was no royalty that's actually written in our constitution you know no titles of royalty and when you have a system where you know I mean where Paris Hilton's great-grandchildren are Kim Kardashian's great-grandchildren will be wealthier than yours no matter what you do no matter how many wonderful clever books us and first you I plan on writing a lot of blank clever bras but but I mean we see study after study dynastic wealth for some families it holds true for many it disappears within two three generations not not completely disappears they'll maybe they'll move from the top quintile to the second topic win tile well let me give you a reason even clear a reason why white people should care if you go to the to Blaine Osiris you know the rich go to work in armored SUVs the pores are in slums and they're very upset do we want to live in a country like that we don't the last time the gap between rich and poor was so significant was 1929 how'd that turn out I mean I think that we're at a real danger unless we have a thriving middle class and that's why everybody should care about this I'm not saying confiscate wealth I'm not saying but I think we do need to level the playing field well I will grant you and I I will also point out that at the time of the founding of the country there were a handful of extraordinarily wealthy people and a bunch of not wealthy people and yeah wasn't no income well sure there was them but also the framers however you make a very good point how did it turn out in 1929 we got Democrats elected for four terms five terms so I agree it's something to worry about if if I have to worry about another Franklin Roosevelt tax me more that's fine by me speaking of the slums speaking of all of this these housing difficulties you were at a very good piece in the LA Times about affordable housing in Los Angeles now I just to fill people in I don't know if it people follow this more local story housing in LA is awful and the homelessness problem is unbelievable so friends of mine live in a very nice building it's a luxury building a fifth of that has to go to low income so you've got drug dealers crazy people living in this or the developers nieces and nephews or the developers nieces and there's a lot of corruption in this town in with but you you're in this luxury building and then around the corner three blocks away is Skid Row is Skid Row which I don't see anything compassionate about letting drug dealers and crazy people live on the streets to destroy a neighborhood and kill each other why is LA why has this government failed so much to address the problems of housing and homelessness well I think there's been a fundamental lack of honesty you know we just talked about the gap between the rich and the poor nobody wants to address the big problems nobody wants to address things like the Federal Reserve printing money which is driven the cost of a loan down has driven property values up so that they're so crazy that now you've got people who are so frustrated with their inability to buy a house that they're saying okay the government should subsidize me buying a house and that gets to be a little bit odd and you have these weird situation where we have more subsidies more socialistic policies going into place and then I also think nobody wants to address the root cause of homelessness or the various root causes of homelessness I mean California just a few years ago put in place this ballot initiative where we released on the streets a lot of people for for a lot of crimes were otherwise they would have been getting the the the attention they deserve getting the the drug rehab that they deserve when they're incarcerated and yet those people are now just on the streets and people think that homelessness is only caused by the high price of houses that's not correct it's caused by mental illness a lot of various things a drug use a lot of things that we have to address all of them if we're gonna be honest about it and and I love that point especially in the mental illness because when we develop these psychotropic drugs in the 1980s we emptied out the insane asylums because they people were fine trouble is once you feel fine you stop taking your psychotropic drugs that's right and you know when someone suggests that maybe we ought to put criminals in prison or that we ought to put crazy people into facilities where they can take medication and see the world more clearly they say that's not compassionate that's bits depriving them of some freedom is there really any Liberty or any compassion in letting these people that live in squalor on the street well that's that's that's the law of unintended consequences right I mean proposition 47 passed by all the voters in the state of California where the majority of voters in the state of California reduced all of these drug crimes from from a felony to a misdemeanor the difference between a felony misdemeanor of course is the judge could look that person in the eye and say unless you go to rehab unless you get help for this drug addiction that you've got you're gonna go to jail for a long time and this scared a lot of people straight and because now this is a mandatory misdemeanor which means in Los Angeles County you'll spend about 12 hours in jail you've got a lot of people not even addressing their addiction and that's a real problem and it's counterintuitive because a lot of my progressive friends say oh let these people yeah okay yeah our society is too hard on drug offenders i stipulate that but we've got to somehow give the tools to judges and juries so that people can find the rehab that they need so that they're not using drugs and stealing and screwing up all of our neighborhoods all right last Democrat talking point is we have so much news to get to obviously the Las Vegas shooting largest mass shooting in American history the gun debate is always back front and center there have been some proposals on how to curb this problem because they say maybe we'll get rid of bump stocks but you can bump fire from regular ar-15 it's a little more difficult also with any bump fire it's been very difficult to aim so it only really works if you're shooting at a gigantic crowd of people is the only answer here to repeal the Second Amendment you have a lot of people on the Left proposing this is that the point where we are right now in in American society we want to give up our right to keep and bear arms well so I'll make three points on this the first one is I got a text from a very successful TV journalist who's a reporter for a major Network major figure source one soon right right after this this right after this incident and she's texted me and said oh my god why don't people realize that the Second Amendment only applied to muskets and below button went on this horrible ramp and and I wrote her back and I said yeah and I don't think I I guess that you should agree that the First Amendment isn't applied to this conversation on our iPhone and it was like I mean excellent excellent analogy I mean people's ideas of rights being transitory even frozen in time it's it you throw out the whole Constitution with that of course but the second thing is and again I see a total lack of honesty I mean most of the most horrific crimes I mean you probably know my father was murdered by someone with a handgun I mean most of the most horrific crimes are committed in our cities with handguns and there is no honesty in the debate people do not want to address this a mass shooting gets our attention I realize that but you know and and what those people suffered through is horrible and nobody should have to suffer through that but I'd like to see people talk more about the root causes of gun violence which is more that more often than not caused by handgun the third thing is if Democratic politicians want to repeal the second member if any politician wants to repeal the second meant they should be honest about it they should say the Constitution against us people it's ours to amend Thomas Jefferson said famously every 25 years or so we should amend the Constitution it's used bloodier language but but if people want to do that the people that people own the Constitution it belongs to all of us and if they want to repeal the Second Amendment and it's a movement that that people should be honest but we shouldn't dance around the issue I've got to help people feel now I for one do not believe in that but but I you know politicians who do should come out and say they should be honest uh you're you're channeling this should scare you by the way you're channeling my feelings at least on the honesty point of this because I think all the time when they bring up assault rifles which have been a legal for 80 years and then they say assault weapons which is a term that was made up in the mid 90s to conflate regular rifles with assault rifles they look scary they're they're big and scary they look like machine guns and so we say okay we got to get rid of those if we get rid of those we'll be fine but as you point out what the awful murder of your father handguns are are the the real problem in gun crime two-thirds of so-called gun violence is middle-aged guys killing themselves and more people are killed by hands and feet every year then are killed by any sort of rifle including assault rifles or shotguns assault weapons quote-unquote or shotguns the honesty in this debate I I really only see honesty on the right among a handful of Democrats who willing to have the courage to go out there like you Joe Manchin other Democrats who are willing to face the issue seriously and but a total of dishonesty permeating the rest of the debate is there any way to fix that I don't know you know as long as both parties are raising money off of these tragedies then I think we're gonna continue to have this lack of meaningful debate I've never been so depressed with with politics in America than I was after this Las Vegas shooting I mean literally a guy like me who's been in politics for a long time in and out of politics I'm cynical and jaded as the rest of them I was so depressive getting a fundraising email from Democratic candidates dancing around the Second Amendment issue getting getting fundraising I mean they also the Republican Congress congressional candidate who's given away bump stocks I mean come on I mean just give me a break people can we can get some honesty I mean the guy who the LAPD has a profile the guy who killed my father they think he was a petty drug user someone who's high out of his mind yeah I would much rather see our society address the drug problem much rather see us address mental illness and things like that I think we can get a lot of headway and I also I'm not as glamorous to address the preponderance of crimes that affect people that affect the rest of their lives then these one-off spectacularly awful crimes that are spectacular for a reason right because they're not the common crime that happens correct absolutely right well all right that's fine I like I really enjoy going through the the talking points with you give me time to all to support you at some well I'm sure you're disappointed when we talk about all of this news that we've had to get to but but it is great because I bet you that if we were on like a cable news show or something and it just had to be what do you think about Trump yes or no what do you think about this talking about yes or no you you just have to you have to stick to the talking points maybe you wouldn't maybe you'd have the courage of your convictions I think most people would do that excellent we have to get to the news we have so much news to talk about we need Mike to just say the craziest most wild and absurd left-wing things you've ever heard but you can't see that unless you go to daily wire calm right now we want to thank all of our current subscribers it's just $10 a month or $100 for an annual membership you'll get me you'll get the Andrew Clavin show you'll get the mention Bureau show I know odd droning on who cares who cares her but wait you get the leftist tears tumblr look at this meat is so delicious I was hoping I know I was really hoping I could fill it up on this fountain of Mike got our today but unfortunately I haven't been able to yet maybe a little later on I'll just keep playing Trump clips you can have yours it is the finest vessel for leftist tears in the entire country perhaps in the entire universe they observed recently scientists observed gravitational waves coming out of two stars colliding and creating the molecules that have forged the leftist tears tumbler Cup it is indestructible go to daily wire calm right now we'll be right back we have so much news here us-backed forces have captured Raqqa the self-described capital of Isis this is so much winning Ariel does this mean that we have officially defeated Isis uh yes and no in some ways so the best way to is to say to ourselves we've taken the self designated caliphate so we've definitely yield a blow to the collective ego of Isis and you know this is a top selling point for them to attract militants from all over the Middle East and the world so as we look at it from a perspective yes it's been a collective blow to their ego now begins the actual workers rebuilding Raqqa which I think will present lots of challenges in the future I also want to give a shout out to the Kurds because the Kurds were a huge part of this victory um it was Kurdish back to militia as well as some Arab factions and you know the fact that he abandoned aim for those in Kurdistan I think it looks really poorly given especially given this recent victory um so you know I guess to get to your question in terms of the ideological defeat of Isis yes but they're still going to be able to communicate with one another on their chat rooms online and and so you know amazingly taking their physical location but in terms of their ability which you know is how they recruit members but in terms of their ability to attract followers that's still very much alive and well so you know we've cut the blood flow in some ways but it's still living and existing so it's gonna we're gonna have to address it as a local organization you've always got to be glass half-empty Ariel come on already gave a shout out to the Kurds very procures yeah you're right to acknowledge that we have a massive Kurdish audience we want to thank all the thick that Kurds who are watching the show right now I know they're great they always team up with us when we're fighting the bad guys and stuff your eminence how much credit can we give Trump here as Ariel said there's still the Isis ideology there's still people who our Islamic extremists who will talk to each other and try to organize but we blown them all up we blew up their whole city Barack Obama saw Isis form under his watch he couldn't take out the city or he didn't want to he didn't want to take out the organization perhaps or he didn't prioritize it how much credit can we give dear leader well I certainly think most of the credit belongs to the forces on the ground who have been fighting bravely throughout all this these past several months their cities are an absolute ruin they've just been going through hell so I definitely think we should keep them in our thoughts and prayers right now as they clean up the mess that Isis has made but in terms of what Trump has done in order to create this outcome certainly he delegated decisions down to the forces and the military personnel on the ground to go ahead and take action without getting prior approval from Washington DC that was something that happened in May when general mattis announced the annihilates Isis anihilation strategy and that has been very very effective thus far I mean we're just six months away and we've already taken Raqqa so yes I do certainly think that Trump Trump's decision-making there certainly should be credited with this victory I'll just correct you on you said general mattis and just for our bloodthirsty listeners who love internet that would be Mad Dog Madison yes Janice tur Mad Dog Mike the to Obama era foreign policy doctrines seem to have been leading from behind and strategic patience this is quite a change president Trump campaigned on defeating Isis prioritizing defeating Isis now it looks like they are defeating Isis how much I'm not asking how much we can give credit to el Donald here but how much can I blame Barack Obama one of my favorite hobbies well the answer is you can't blame Barack Obama at all and and and you I mean you know Donald Trump and his followers have got to stop taking credit for policies that Barack Obama put in place where you're now seeing play out you know today or yesterday Donald Trump sent something we did the Dow hit 23,000 oh my gosh great great great the reality is the Dow has been on a here since about 2009 at the depths of the of the mortgage crisis that started under Barack Obama continued under President Trump and the reality is is that if you own the successes you ought to own the failures to at some point in the next three years the next in the Trump presidencies I'm assuming we're going to go into recession I'd like to see his followers own those defeats as well I absolutely will not thank you very much sorry go ahead success has many fathers but failure is an orphan and I think a lot of these policies were put in place a long time ago and they were going in the right direction some have some heaven I'll grant you the stock market we can't the Republicans can't take total credit for the stock market error it has been building since 2009 this seems a little different there does seem to have been a big shift in military policy so I'm not sure I am willing to give Donald Trump some credit here but I do grant it's you know Barack Obama campaign he said GM is alive and I was sama bin Laden's dead but of course the work to capture Osama bin Laden had been building for over a decade there were almost a decade rather so yes these there is more complication here Bill Clinton took a lot of credit for the great economy in the 90s probably you could credit Ronald Reagan and George Bush for that but I'm only going to give credit to the Republicans and blame the Democrats thank you very much it's actually honest and it is it consistently there now this is the big story there are three genders in California which one are you which one am I Democratic Governor Jerry Brown a man you know very well Mike he's signed to the gender recognition act Sunday which lets residents choose non-binary on identification documents such as driver's licenses and birth certificates I believe I just heard Paul dois sighing not surprised at all Arielle you know we just had Blair white on last week we just had on a youtuber who is transgender biological male identifies as a woman what's wrong with codifying this third gender hmm well I think it's different from being you know from identifying as a man or a woman that doesn't necessarily I don't think that poses a problem actually and I think you touched upon that in your last podcast I think we're we talk about sort of non-identifying either I'm kind of approaching this from the statistical chance standpoint so I do economic research as you know and a lot of a lot of the research whether it be from the US Census Bureau or be from a statistical database belong to the state it is codified by mail email this is how we look at economic out cuts this is how we look at average earnings this is how we basically addressed any statistical analysis this through looking at the lens of mail you know so coming at it from sort of the statistical perspective if enough people decide that they identify as neither then I think this could pose some problems down the road I know for instance in Oregon when they did an unspecified gender it I think it cost something around thirty thousand dollars to update their dot their statistical databases Californians about ten times the size of Oregon's um so we could be looking at a bill of around 1/2 million in order to make these adjustments which if you look at California spending is really not that much because our state spends the time but when you look at sort of what challenges might come down the road I don't think enough people are going to identify as non-binary that's going to be a statistical problem and but if it does sort of become the vogue or popular way of the resistance which has no intersectionality and the homeworks this rhetoric that comes with that I have no doubt that it will you form with resistance to Donald Trump just wait then it could be a problem and though I you know I really don't take a huge issue with it right now but I do see you know at least from a statistical sample and measuring outcomes it could be a problem of the future enough people decide either that this is their form of resistance in which case it sort of denigrate submission or the intention of it as a whole which was to sort of give people who felt like they couldn't fit neither category you know a voice or an identity and now I could see people using it as a political form of resistance yes absolutely and that's and of course the issue is that there isn't a third gender there is not a third gender right there is a very minuscule number of people who were born intersex hermaphroditic they had both sexual organs in some cases they have crazy chromosomes that don't fit male or female those are that is a vanishingly small number of people and there are a slightly larger number of people who are either male or female who have a psychological affliction that makes them think that they are the other gender or desperately wanting the other gender or feel a metaphysical level that they are the other gender Atlas and I identify as an author I'm not an author but I identify as one I have empathy on this subject but Mike no one really thinks there's a third gender is there some good being done to society by indulging in this delusion well let me start with with a couple principles and the first one hopefully means something to a lot of your audience which is simply just live and let live it doesn't hurt anybody to allow people to be called a pronoun or a gender that they want I disagree with what Arielle said a great amount I think that transgender people face a lot of stigma in our society I can't imagine anybody wanting to go through that just as a form of political protest against Trump I'll make the bold prediction here in 2017 that that's not going to happen I think you know this is really just comes down to live and let live why does not let people live the way that they want to live I don't think it hurts anybody and I think that this thing gives a modicum of respect and dignity to people who who want it but does it I mean that is the question is the road to hell paved with good intentions because one might say well who cares if a man pretend not only pretends that he's a woman but pretends that he's a mythical undefined third gender what it doesn't really affect me it doesn't affect my bottom line it doesn't affect my bank account or something but you know we're not just material creatures we learn as Winston Churchill said when great forces are on the move in the world we learned that we are spirits not animals there is an insistence if the government is going to say that there is a third gender then the government is telling me you have to view sir reality unreality as reality with the full coercion and compulsion of the law they're telling me that I have to look at the world and pretend that it's something that it isn't your eminence Paul bois is there any evidence here that there are that there are bad consequences from this that the road to hell is paved with good intentions well the road to hell we are on Michael Ball blog coming live from the Vatican with good intentions I mean yeah maybe 50 years ago this isn't even just about making transgenders feel good about themselves as the the bathroom debate was about this is just this is your like you said this is the government just legislating complete fantasy I mean if they want to be ideologically consistent here why don't they just go ahead and just say you can put whatever you want you know say that you're a unicorn say that you're a Raggedy Ann doll whatever it is you want to come up with you know the possibilities are endless are limitless you know it's it's ridiculous and like you said yeah the government right now by doing this is literally saying that the states is pretty much saying and stamping their approval on something that doesn't exist guys I should point out I know we've left this out of the show credits Paul blah is played by Carroll O'Connor I don't want to let that go without pointing that out next on we have to get off the transgender thing that's all anybody ever talks about these days John McCain Senator John McCain shockingly is attacking President Trump here is to fear the world we have organized and led the three-quarters of a century to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain the last best hope of Earth for the sake of some half-baked spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats and solve problems eriell spurious means false does this mean that john mccain only approves of true nationalism well i think you know he's served he's making a jab at the america first agenda that donald trump put forward and during this campaign i think if we look at sort of you know i do agree there were some things that john mccain said that i did agree with the idea that we are a nation united by ideals I think what heard over the last or last eight years was dividing a nation by identity politics right and actually this is something Alan Glu eastcoast Razi and wrote about in the closing American mine in the late 80s he said you know mark my words we are a nation that was founded on ideals but increasingly and he observed this in the 60s increasingly there's a push to divide us by you know what we don't have in common which whether it be our race our gender our sexuality and you know I'm someone that I firmly believe that we should be pushing back against that I firmly believe that we should be returning to this idea of uniting behind ideals and I don't think America as the abstract concept is divisive I think it is representative of ideal so saying America first isn't inherently divisive in fact I think that's the attitude we should be having and I think it's a welcome departure from the last eight years we've been cuckooing the idea of American exceptionalism if we can identify an objective good if we can't say that America offers one of the best systems in the world for women to advance themselves you know if you go to other countries across the globe there are not the educational opportunities career opportunities basic independence that we have as women in America and I'm comfortable saying we have a better system I can't believe it I don't know more shal can you stop this hateful rhetoric can you please mute Ariel I can't I'm gonna throw a desk or something I know and so I don't have a problem with the idea of saying you know we have an awesome wonderful system and we should celebrate that and that came across in parts of the King's Speech but I think just you know there have been people nefarious elements especially within the alt-right and we've seen it with youth these scattered Nazi marches I heard my god oohs I'm out right what I don't know you've seen people warp that message and use it to advance their horrible agendas and I couldn't agree more that's a problem but to say that you know that's that fake patriotism is what drives a majority the country I don't look at 250 you know white supremacist buttheads in Charlottesville who don't deserve that time of day right I don't I think that's a bad I wasn't sure she said Butthead or something else it's clarifying whether I get because I do like you can't do it we have only the highest standards here and I take your point absolutely that's America I look at you know what the people I run into every day on the train who helped me when I drop something or I look at you know I look at America as being full of people who I can connect with and if the people I run into on the train are America then this country is in a lot of trouble mike is nationalism a bad word nationalism isn't a bad word I mean there's nothing wrong with saying that our country is great and our country is exceptional and our country is different and unique in the history of mankind because it is but I think John McCain knows a thing or two about nonsense patriotism he knows a thing or two about chickenhawks he's been debating him his whole career and he does a thing or two about giving and sacrificing so much for a war that might have been not well conceived or or well thought of from political standpoint what's fascinating though about the John McCain versus Donald Trump thing is my friends you know in both parties who one day love John McCain the next day hate him one day think he's a hero the next day are slamming him when he stands up that he's going to vote for this they say oh he's great and then I mean and this is really indicative of politics in 2017 there is no truth there is no sense of an absolute war concept yeah thank yeah that's that's an unfortunate product of our post modernity but we're gonna try to fix it here we're gonna keep pandering like the New York Times says we does pandering to our audience because it likes the truth Mike thank you for being here appreciate it I'll see you next time a semi almost possibly reasonable Democrat I'm Michael Knowles's the Michael Knowles show come back tomorrow and we'll do it all again you
