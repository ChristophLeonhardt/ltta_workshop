let's play that it's like a toy
does not look real
I feel like we're at the Air and Space
Museum in a simulator the Democratic
Republic of Congo is one of Africa's
largest countries both in terms of
population and geographic area
it sits on one of the world's largest
reserves of natural resources yet
remains one of the poorest nations in
the world with a seemingly never-ending
cycle of war kleptocratic leaders and a
mad scramble for resources the Congo has
been left with less functioning
infrastructure today than it had 60
years ago there are almost no roads
linking the massive nation together and
those that do exist are subject to the
control of more than 50 constantly
shifting rebel groups scattered
throughout the country but people and
things still need to get around and with
roads largely out of the question
flying is the best option but the Congo
also has one of the worst airline
records in Peru
every single Congolese airline is
blacklisted in the
due to their failure to keep up with
international safety standards there are
pilots and flight crews from all over
the world operating in the Congo but one
group in particular got us interested
the Russians
coming here after the fall of the USSR
the Russian pilots of the Congo have
become infamous for their ancient
airplanes low-flying stems and rowdy
after-hours activities they have also
become the nation's go-to guys - flying
anything anywhere no matter what so we
came to the Congo to meet them for
ourselves however actually finding them
turned out to be a lot more difficult
than we had imagined the Russian pilots
mainly came from military in their
country but soon after the Soviet Union
collapsed several of them got contracts
overseas the X Soviet Union wants to get
rid of this plane and they're very cheap
it's just good for the owner when we
meet a Russian plane in the sky we need
to pay attention because we know they
not take talking the same language that
we do we could be at the same level
coming opposite direction it could be
very dangerous
yes that's what makes the Russian we
packed up and took the overnight ferry
down to Bukavu a port city only queue
that was once the thriving capital of
commerce in the eastern Congo we'd
arranged to meet up with a crew of
Russian pilots stationed there however
as soon as we pulled in support we got a
phone call with some bad news we've
heard that the planes are currently
grounded the Antonovs
that the Russian pilots usually fly
because they failed the safety test
too many times which is hard to do here
because all the planes are blacklisted
anyway but for a plane to be grounded
you know it has to be really bad so
almost as soon as we'd arrived
we turned around and took the Express
ferry back to Goma where we'd heard
rumors that an entirely different
Russian crew might be living
and then the night we got back to Goma
fighting broke out again over a period
of ten dates a slew of bombs and mortars
filled the sky striking several civilian
centers throughout town the onslaught
was the most recent bout of fighting
between the Congolese army and a rebel
group known as m23 widely believed to be
backed by neighboring Rwanda
due to go MA and a bomb fell here like
everyone's saying it came from Rwanda
but it's really hard to confirm these
things because there's rumors running
rampant around town about everyone is
gathering so we can see what happened
last night in the weeks following the
bombings throughout town a new offensive
led by Congolese and United Nations
Armed Forces finally defeated m23 with
their top leaders in over 1,500 rebel
soldiers surrendering a neighboring
Uganda
however even with m23 out of the picture
more than 30 rebel groups still remain
in the eastern Congo eager to take over
where m23 left off
with the whole town celebrating a rare
victory for peace finally got the call
our pilots were ready to meet us it's
6:00 a.m. we finally found the elusive
Soviet pilots and today we'll be flying
with them to zero
Bennie and Keith's and got a special
porridge
what is special porridge
very good day
do ever have days off where you don't
slap any state
every day even when there aren't mortars
exploding 500 meters away from the
runway it's incredibly difficult to film
at the Goma Airport so we turned off our
cameras drove right up next to the plane
and within five minutes we were lined up
ready for takeoff
and we're flying to a zero it smells
like sulfur because we just passed the
volcano
we have maybe about 50 minutes so I feel
slight until we get there
looking at the train also you can
understand why there's no roads
thick bush
jungle bush oh my god
oh it's actually pretty smooth we just
landed at our first stop for the day in
Ichiro Congo it's very warm very nice
they're currently unloading some cargo
some cigarettes I think after they're
done we'll hop back on and fly to our
next destination
how big is the city it's very small
you've never seen it you've only ever
been to the airport after taking off
Valentin the flight engineer served us
an in-flight meal of sausage tomatoes
and plain bread then after a quick
50-minute flight it was touchdown in
Beni which is basically just a dirt road
in the middle of a field we had a quick
refuel reactant a fresh stock of hair
conditioner and then it was off to
Keith's and Ghani
our last stop of the day before
returning home to go so just drive in
Keith's and Ghani and there's a lot of
military aircrafts on the other side of
the plane which is why we're facing this
direction but so we're gonna stop
filming now things are getting a little
sketchy so we're headed to Goma and i'm
back home while we waited to take off
the crew introduced us to their good
friend captain vitaly a belarusian pilot
flying for a different Congolese airline
captain vitaly had a treasure trove of
home videos from his 20 years of flying
in the congo all of which he was very
eager to share with us where were you
flying
we could smell it when we went by
earlier besides flying captain Battaglia
was super passionate about the Russian
sauna experience which he insisted was
like no other sauna experience in the
world we agreed to go the next day set
our good-byes and took off for home
experiencing a little turbulence if it
weren't like a storm
had smooth sailing all day
and now it's getting a little freaky in
here
as we approach trainee Goma things
smooth out we landed the plane shut off
the camera and headed back to the crew
house for a home-cooked meal prepared by
Alek the ground engineer and house as
promised the next day captain vitaly
took us to a Russian crew house on Lake
EVOO rents out by Congolese airline the
house was by far the nicest we'd seen in
Goma
and although the crew didn't want to be
filmed they gave us full access to the
sauna in their backyard
but it is too far from the nether yeah
so let us begun oh okay chamber
temperature
Anglet 10 degrees relax you can do water
but never drink up first
if you pass because it is not good for
heart maximum you can so next type 10
minutes is hot area they put water over
the stone and who lay down who must if
order how he feel if you feel ready what
who is on top have to help him to get
our temperature from hot place I give
you some time some time with temperature
you said to get out go douche and have
rest
normally country something that is all
procedure welcome to Russia
after waking up with baby smooth skin
and still smelling strongly of
eucalyptus we met with Alec who promised
to cook us something special
on young
milk Safari with 40 the pie is a 4k
this with our grocery list all crossed
off we started in on the ravioli with a
little heart-to-heart on the side good a
difference for grain for
from words not for me it's not broken we
see computer HDTV
after it's not problem for me no it's
for Congo for me it's not problem it's
not it's not good condition I'm not
working political it's not working with
the ravioli in the pot and the vodka in
the freezer we sat down with the captain
for an interview
can I tell the nice we live our life
here as my home situation is country
sometimes changes really quickly but
we were jobless countries generation
will come
very good people sometimes we
estrangement strange for him for
our wife
and not not you know sick
we came to the Congo looking for a group
of drink slinging low-flying pilots but
we found hard-working crews operating
some of the worst conditions in the
world coming home tonight's just like
these it happens all the time all over
the country small pockets of people
recreating their home in a land that
could not be any more different with an
end in sight to nearly two decades war
with Rwanda the Democratic Republic of
Congo stands a crucial juncture in its
history the Russian pilots however
remain largely isolated from that
outcome whatever happens they'll have to
be there doing their job just the same
it'll chip away another you're talking
about that is foot boy
