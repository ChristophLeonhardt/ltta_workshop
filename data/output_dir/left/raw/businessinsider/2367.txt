00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:15,059
Jeremy Stoppelman with us<font color="#CCCCCC"> eeo of yelp</font>

2
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,340
Jeremy you've got great distribution

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,590
channels great content how do you know

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,449
how much live foot traffic you're

5
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,550
driving to say your local partners or

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,320
local businesses is there a metric that

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,000
you follow is there a way that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,199
audit that trail certainly there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,059
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we capture on the</font>

10
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so for instance any local</font>

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,930
business can claim and unlock their page

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,600
on Yelp and in doing so you get access

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to how many views your business page has</font>

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">been seen if you're an advertiser we</font>

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,170
also give you click information and then

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,489
for a lot of businesses they're actually

17
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,440
used to asking customers hey how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,940
find me so when you go to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor's</font>

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,350
office they have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> little line on the</font>

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">forms that says you know who referred</font>

21
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,739
you and so people put down yelps<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

22
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,840
another mechanism out there there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,239
newer channels or newer mechanisms that

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,340
people have been experimenting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with for</font>

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,570
instance changing the phone number to a

26
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,700
tracking phone number and we've been

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,290
doing some experimentation with that we

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,720
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past but that's less common</font>

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,130
than sort of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old-fashioned way of</font>

30
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,260
asking your customers so is there a way

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,000
for them to get more information about

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,049
their customers in terms of

33
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,759
profitability or how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many times a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">they come any sort of metric like that</font>

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">outside of what you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about</font>

36
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah for right now the main way to</font>

37
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,210
analyze your customer bases is doing it

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,680
the old-fashioned way so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

39
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,810
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> list you know certainly that</font>

40
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,729
person comes in they make purchases you

41
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,229
know you can keep track<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that on your</font>

42
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">own but it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much a manual process</font>

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so are you thinking about recording</font>

44
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,720
or capturing that data in terms of

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,610
monetizing that network effect I know

46
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,020
that there are companies out there like

47
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,850
gowalla and Foursquare that are sort of

48
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that are you thinking about that</font>

49
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,170
in terms of the evolving business model

50
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,149
and offering that to your partners I

51
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,430
mean I think it's a it's an interesting

52
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,040
concept how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the door</font>

53
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,350
and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> check-in but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think what you're</font>

54
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,270
seeing out there is that a minority of

55
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,890
people are going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to walk</font>

56
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,870
in the door<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

57
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,030
check in every time and so while it's

58
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,800
useful information to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> business is</font>

59
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,810
not necessarily all customers that have

60
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,150
ever walked in so you know it's another

61
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,410
data point and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

62
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">valuable and it's an interesting</font>

63
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,890
innovation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't necessarily</font>

64
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,350
you know track every single person in in

65
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,330
the door okay I know you're working with

66
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,010
flixster in terms of updating movie

67
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,200
times and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot is there an open table</font>

68
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,090
partnership in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> works being able to</font>

69
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,960
just go online and you know through your

70
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,020
mobile app on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yelp you know also get</font>

71
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,200
reservations at restaurants yeah I think

72
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a natural integration point for</font>

73
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">us you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's open table or</font>

74
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,570
whether it's another reservation

75
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,370
provider a ticket provider we've been

76
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,990
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of those potential</font>

77
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,940
partnerships and so I think in the

78
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,530
coming years will certainly see some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

79
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,630
those come together great so finally

80
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,520
thoughts on citysearch haha is it dead I

81
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,440
think you know it's a huge market out

82
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,270
there we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a great position we're</font>

83
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,070
really excited about what yelps been

84
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,680
doing is the traction that we have and

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">we really I think I pulled away is the</font>

86
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,640
content leaders and local and so that's

87
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,590
given us a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of strength but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

88
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,420
to say that other models are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

89
00:03:11,420 --> 00:00:00,000
to be successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course thank you</font>
