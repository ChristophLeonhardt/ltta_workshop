BRIAN.
BRIAN: LET'S GO TO THIS.
THIS MORNING THE CARAVAN OF
MIGRANTS PUSHING CLOSER TO
THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
RIGHT TO OUR BORDER.
DESPITE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES
SUPPOSE SUPPOSED BEST
EFFORTS TO STOP THEM.
OUR NEXT GUEST WHO LEGALLY
IMMIGRATED TO AMERICA FROM
NICARAGUA IS CALLING THIS
CARAVAN A TOTAL INVASION.
CALLING IT AN ACT OF WAR.
HERE TO EXPLAIN HANS BURGER,
FOUNDER OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS
FOR AMERICA.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ACT OF WAR?
I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO OPEN UP OUR ARMS AND HAVE
COMPASSION?
>> WELL, THE VARY CAN IS --
ACT OF WAR WHICH IS DEFINED
AS AN ACT OF AGGRESSION BY A
COUNTRY WHICH CONSTITUTES AN
IMMEDIATE THREAT TOE PIECE.
AND I -- IMMEDIATE THREAT TO
NATIONAL SECURITY.
BRIAN: NOW YOU ARE A LEGAL
IMMIGRANT.
YOU CAME FROM NICARAGUA.
>> YES.
BRIAN: HOW DID YOU DO IT?
>> LEGALLY, I WENT TO THE
EMBASSY, FILLED OUT FORMS.
SUBMITTED MYSELF TO THE
VETTING PROCESSION AND
WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE
EMBASSY TO APPROVE MY
COMING.
THAT'S HOW PEOPLE SHOULD DO
IT.
BRIAN: THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT
WAITING FOR THAT WHY ARE
THEY COMING HERE AND WHO ARE
THEY?
>> I BELIEVE THAT THEY
ARE -- WE DO NOT KNOW.
BUT THEY ARE A THREAT TO OUR
NATIONAL SECURITY BECAUSE
TODAY WAR IS NOT ONLY
COUNTRIES THAT GO TO WAR, IT
IS GROUPS, SUCH AS ISIS.
HEZBOLLAH, HAMAS, THE
TALIBAN, AND THEY HAVE
DECLARED WAR OPENLY AGAINST
THE UNITED STATES.
SO, WITH THE OPEN BORDERS
POLICIES WE HAVE HAD.
HOW MANY OF THEM ARE IN
AMERICA?
THAT'S THE QUESTION.
BRIAN: RIGHT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED THIS
OUT.
A CARAVANS ARE A DISGRACE TO
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
CHANGE THE IMMIGRATION LAWS
NOW.
YOU POINT OUT, TOO.
THE CARAVAN ORGANIZERS ARE A
PROBLEM.
AND BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING
FROM COUNTRIES IN HONDURAS,
FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS NUMBER
ONE IN THE WORLD IN
HOMICIDES.
EL SALVADOR IS NUMBER 4,
GUATEMALA IS NUMBER 5.  JUST
ON STATISTICAL PURPOSES JUST
RUNNING THE STATS.
SABER METRICS.
THIS DOESN'T LOOK AS THOUGH,
WE ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING
OURSELVES SOME SECURITY
ISSUES BY ALLOWING 5 TO
7,000 WE DON'T KNOW IN.
45,000 WILL BE COMING NEXT?
>> YES.
I BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBERS
INCREASE EVERY TIME THEY
COME IN SUCCESSFULLY AND AT
WHAT POINT ARE WE GOING TO
CALL THEM -- CALL THE
ORGANIZER COMMITTING AN ACT
OF WAR?
IS IT 40,000 WHEN THEY BRING
IN 40,000 STRANGERS?
BRIAN: WHAT IS THE MESSAGE
INSIDE NICARAGUA?
WHY DO THEY FEEL THEY CAN
COME HERE OR HONDURAS?
WHY ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY
FEEL LIKE THE FLOOD GATES
ARE OPEN?
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> I BELIEVE THEY ARE
ENTICED BY PEOPLE THAT FUND
THEIR CARAVAN WITH MONEY.
THEY ARE INSTRUCTED WHAT TO
SAY.
WHAT TO DO.
THEY ARE ALSO BRAINWASHED
INTO BELIEVING THEY BELONG
IN THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA AND THAT THEY HAVE
RIGHTS TO COME IN AND ASK
FOR BENEFITS.
BRIAN: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
