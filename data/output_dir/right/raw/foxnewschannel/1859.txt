00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:45,486
I LIKE IT WHEN HE TELLS STORIES

71
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:48,923

IN AMENT.

83
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:32,833

LIST HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS,

87
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:43,444
BECAUSE HE HAD THE ENTIRE MEDIA

88
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:44,345
DOING IT FOR HIM.

89
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:47,148

TALK TO HIM.

100
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:22,783

BECAUSE OF THE EVENING FEEDING

115
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:09,163
AND THEY THROW THEM MEAT.

116
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:11,131
HOW ABOUT IMMIGRATION?

117
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:14,335
THEY WANT TO TEAR DOWN YOUR

118
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:23,594

119
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:24,311

WHAT ABOUT BILL BELICHEK.

122
00:05:26,914 --> 00:05:30,317
THEY THROW THEM IN WITH INDIANA

126
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:36,190

MONTHS.

130
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:43,597
>> NO, NO, THIS IS NEW.

131
00:05:43,597 --> 00:05:46,567
I THINK THE MID-TERMS.

132
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:50,938
HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT 2018 ONCE

133
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:54,575
HE GOT BEYOND MIKE BRAWN THE

134
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:56,210
CANDIDATE FOR U.S. SENATE IN

135
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,543
INDIANA.

136
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:59,079
HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT 2020

137
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,381
AND TALKED ABOUT KEEP AMERICA

138
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:00,681
GREAT.

139
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,082
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE

140
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:03,884
WORKING FOR YOUR FELLOW

THE KEY FOR ME IN TERMS OF

143
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:11,725
POLITICS?

144
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:13,661
TAX CUT PLAN HASN'T PROVEN TO BE

145
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:14,028
EFFECTIVE.

146
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:14,662
>> THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

147
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:20,668
>> AND THE POLL'S OPINION.

148
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:22,102
HERE'S THE THING.

149
00:06:22,102 --> 00:06:24,705
LAST NIGHT HE SAID WHEN IT COMES

150
00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:31,712
TO TACKLERS  -- TAXES, THE

151
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:33,580
DEMOCRATS LED BY PELOSI WANT TO

152
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,282
RAISE YOUR TAXES.

153
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:37,017
IT'S THESE PEOPLE WHO WILL RAISE

154
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:37,318
THEM.

155
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:40,087
>> THANKS FOR TAKING MY JOB.

156
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:42,690
WE HAVE SOME OF THAT SOUND FROM

157
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,023
PELOSI.

158
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:47,394
LET'S HEAR IT AND HAVE KENNEDY

159
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:47,695
REACT.

160
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:49,730
>> NANCY PELOSI SAID YESTERDAY,

161
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,267
SHE WANTS TO END THE TAX CUTS

162
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:55,102
AND RAISE YOUR TAXES.

163
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:56,804
IS THAT LIKE GOOD POLITICS.

164
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:58,672
IT'S NOT ABOUT POLITICS.

165
00:06:58,672 --> 00:07:00,407
THINK ABOUT THAT FROM A

166
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:01,642
POLITICAL STANDPOINT.

167
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:03,477
I DON'T THINK HER PARTY WAS TOO

168
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:03,777
HAPPY.

169
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:06,613
THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES

170
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:08,349
AND YOURTACTS.

171
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,384
-- TAX CUTS.

172
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:11,118
THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS WHERE

173
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:13,520
EVERYONE FLIES INTO OUR COUNTRY.

174
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,290
THAT IS NOT HAPPENING.

175
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,792
>> KENNEDY, JUAN IS WRONG ABOUT

176
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:19,626
THE TAX CUTS.

177
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:20,461
>> OH MY GOD.

178
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:22,262
>> DEMOCRATS HAVE PLENTY OF

179
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:24,398
THINGS THEY CAN RUN ON.

180
00:07:24,398 --> 00:07:26,367
THERE ARE ALWAYS THINGS YOU CAN

181
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:28,902
JUDGE WITHIN AN ADMINISTRATION.

182
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:30,404
DEMOCRATS WITH LOOK AT THINGS

183
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:31,271
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T DONE

184
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:33,774
PERFECTLY AND ALTER THOSE AND

185
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:36,677
THAT CAN BE YOUR NEW PLAN.

186
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:38,045
DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING ABOUT

187
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:38,846
ENDING THE TAX CUTS.

188
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:40,013
PEOPLE GETTING A COUPLE OF GRAND

189
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:43,717
EXTRA A YEAR, THAT HURTS THEM.

190
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:47,287
THAT'S NOT JUST CRUMPS.

191
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:50,224
IF YOU HAD $200 EXTRA EVERY

192
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:56,230
MONTH IN YOUR PAYCHECK, THAT CAN

193
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,032
BE HELPFUL TO A FAMILY OF 4 AND

194
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:01,201
A GOOD TRIP TO COSTCO.

195
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:02,970
WHAT YOU ARE DOING NOW IS

196
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,039
OFFERING RESISTANCE.

197
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,042
THAT FALSE FLAT.

198
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:16,283
IF YOU ARE GOING TO SUPER

199
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:19,153
PROGRESSIVE, IT WON'T BE THIS

200
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:19,987
VICTORIOUS MID-TERM.

201
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:22,189
I WANT TO GET BACK TO NORTH

202
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:22,489
KOREA.

203
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:23,524
>> FIRST, LET ME RESPOND TO WHAT

204
00:08:23,524 --> 00:08:26,193
YOU SAID.

205
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:28,962
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT

206
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:35,068
ABOUT THE CRUMBS.

207
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:39,206
FOR REPUBLICANS IT BLEW UP THE

208
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:40,607
DEFICIT.

209
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,208
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN

210
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,244
LIBERALS SPEND WILDLY.

211
00:08:44,244 --> 00:08:48,582
>> IF YOU RAISE TAXES AND RAISE

212
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:50,951
SPENDING, NOT ONLY WHAT

213
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:52,586
DEMOCRATS ALWAYS WANT TO DO.

214
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:54,254
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO

215
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:55,055
RIGHT NOW.

216
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:56,990
RAISE TAXES TO FUND DOMESTIC

217
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,259
PROGRAMS BUT THEY WON'T CUT

218
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:01,728
MILTARY SPENDING OR

219
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:02,763
ENTILINGMENTS AND THE BERNIE

220
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:05,799
SANDERS PART OF YOUR PARTY WANTS

221
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,769
TO GIVE PEOPLE FREE COLLEGE AND

222
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:10,604
AMNESTY FOR THOSE WITH

223
00:09:10,604 --> 00:09:11,638
OUTSTANDING COLLEGE DEBT.

224
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,307
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NORTH KOREA

225
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:14,374
AND ADDRESS SOMETHING THE

226
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:15,175
PRESIDENT SAID.

227
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:16,777
HE WAS TALKING TO THE

228
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:20,113
NAYSAYERERS WHO WERE UP IN ARMS

229
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:23,250
ABOUT THE TWEETS AND RHETORIC HE

230
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,452
WAS USING AGAINST KIM JONG-UN.

231
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:27,154
I THINK THAT IS FAIR.

232
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:29,423
WE DIDN'T KNOW -- THERE IS NO

233
00:09:29,423 --> 00:09:32,893
WAY PEOPLE CAN FORESEE THE

234
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:33,227
OUTCOME.

235
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:34,094
IT GAVE HILLARY CLINTON AND

236
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:35,829
PEOPLE LIKE THAT TO SAY, IF I

237
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:38,031
WERE PRESIDENT, I WOULD HAVE

238
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:40,133
SAID NICE THINGS TO KIM JONG-UN

239
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:41,835
AND HE IS CALLING HIM LITTLE

240
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:44,638
ROCKET MAN AND WE ARE ALL GOING

241
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:45,305
TO DIE.

242
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:47,474
THEN THERE IS A HUGE 90 DEGREE

243
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:49,476
SHIFT FROM THAT.

244
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:53,313
NOW WE HAVE 3 AMERICAN HOSTAGES

245
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:56,850
HOME AND ON THE ROAD TO A

246
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,151
DIPLOMAT SIT DOWN.

247
00:09:58,151 --> 00:10:01,088
>> THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT.

248
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:04,691
>> WOULD HILLARY CLINTON HAVE

249
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:05,726
GOTTEN US HERE?

250
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:08,228
>> DON'T COUNT YOUR EGGS BEFORE

251
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:10,163
THEY HATCH.

252
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:13,967
YOU ARE WAY AHEAD OF THE CURVE.

253
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:17,070
>> GREG, HE HAS PEACE,

254
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,572
PROSPERITY AND SECURITY.

255
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:21,375
ISIS IS DEAD.

256
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,409
PEACE ON THE PENINSULA.

257
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,077
I WILL WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE

258
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:26,747
IF I HAVE TO AND PEOPLE HAVE AN

259
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:30,417
EXTRA $2,000 IN THEIR POCKET.

260
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:31,552
THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN THE LEFT

261
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:37,357
TALKS ABOUT STORMY AND

262
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:38,358
IMPEACHMENT.

263
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:40,694
>> AMERICA IS LIKE DISNEYLAND.

264
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:44,464
THE MEDIA IS STUCK IN THE

265
00:10:44,464 --> 00:10:48,335
TEACUPS.

266
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:56,009
THEY ARE NAUSEATED GOING AROUND

267
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:57,044
AND AROUND.

268
00:10:57,044 --> 00:10:58,579
HOW DID IRAN BEGIN?

269
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:00,280
ANGRY TWEET.

270
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:08,255
BUT THEY ARE TWEETING.

271
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:08,855
>> YES.

272
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:11,858
>> THEY'RE ACTUALLY --

273
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:13,260
>> [OVERLAPPING TALKING].

274
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,630
>> BUT THERE IS COMMUNICATION.

275
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,932
IT'S NEGATIVE COMMUNICATION, BUT

276
00:11:18,932 --> 00:11:20,300
THIS IS HOW NORTH KOREA STARTED.

277
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,335
IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN.

278
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:25,305
IF HE KEEPS WINNING LIKE THIS,

279
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:28,542
THE DEMOCRATS --

280
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:31,278
>> QUICK, LOOKING AT THE

281
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:32,112
MID-TERM ELECTIONS.

282
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:33,447
WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY AND

283
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:38,018
THE TIGHTENING OF THE GAP

284
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:40,420
LOOKING FAVORABLE FOR THE

285
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,389
DEMOCRATS AND NOW FAVORABLE FOR

286
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:44,491
THE REPUBLICANS FOR THE HOUSE.

287
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:47,060
FEELING THAT AS WELL.

288
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,097
AND THE CROWD.

289
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:53,467
>> YES.

290
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:53,967
>> ABSOLUTELY.

291
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:58,905
>> SICK EVER WEB -- SICK OF

292
00:11:58,905 --> 00:11:59,239
WINNING.

293
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:01,775
YOU CAN SEE IT ON HIS FACE.

294
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:05,379
>> IF TRUMP SWITCHES PARTIES AND

295
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,246
BECOMES A DEMOCRAT.

296
00:12:06,246 --> 00:00:00,000
>> HE CHANGED PARTIES BEFORE.
