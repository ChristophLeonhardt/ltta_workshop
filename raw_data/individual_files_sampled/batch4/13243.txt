according to the media Donald Trump is enjoying a great economy because of Barack Obama Barack Obama had a bad economy because of george w bush whenever obama's economy was bad it was bush's fault whenever trump's economy is good it's to obama's credit Trump's presidency is Obama's that's why it's so good but Obama's presidency was Bush's that's why it was so bad in the entire eight years Obama was president it was really Bush being president ruining everything but this last year-and-a-half when things have gone so well under Trump Obama was secretly president being Trump as opposed to when Obama was president and it was really Bush Obama saved the economy with his brilliant genius II economic economic genius Obama believed that if you took money away from the rich people who produce things and gave it to the poor people who don't produce things the poor people would then help the economy by buying things from the rich people who hadn't produced those things because their money had been taken away thus the poor people could buy things the rich people would have made if the poor people hadn't taken away their money Trump's theory is different his theory is stop taking people's money and they'll make things and buy things but the only reason that works is because Trump is secretly Obama in like disguise or something trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the

know I have to tell you this i watching the f NFL flap yesterday and also watching this stupid thing about not having a beauty pageant during the Miss America pageant the left is trying to school us to hate ourselves the left is trying to school us to hate ourselves they're trying to tell us that our natural passions our natural desires are somehow evil in and of themselves because they think that people they think that people are naturally good they don't understand the fall of man and broken humanity so they don't understand that really first of all your passions are gifts from God your desires are gifts from God they define who you are they define the shape of you there likes aliens aliens are the things that stick out there like the things that stick out of you your desires your passions the trick of life the whole trick of life is training your passions to the good right attaching your passions to the good you're not supposed to get rid of them you're not supposed to hate your desires you're not supposed to hate your erotic desires your your ambitions your even your desire for money you're not supposed to hate those things you're supposed to attach them to the good you're supposed to get money by doing something that other people will like use the money for the good you're supposed to use you know what what would your life be like if say you know you're in love with your wife your erotically attracted to your wife but you also know that she is good right you've discussed this with yourself should I marry this girl is she really good is she somebody or am I just attracted to her you understand that there's a difference between your passion and and her quality but once you can bring her quality once you realize quality's good what would a man be like who didn't have passion for his wife you know you love your mother right but you want your mother to be good if your mother is evil then you might have to break off that love you might have to break off that attachment what would a man be like if he didn't love his mother he'd be unnatural there'd be something wrong with them figure it think of it like a glass and wine all right so you got the the passion is the glass the good is the wine right you fill the glass up with the good if you don't fill the glass up with the wine if with the good then all you've gotten is an empty glass your passions are empty they're attached to whatever they just attach themselves to that doesn't work but if you have no glass the wine goes nowhere you have nothing that will it's not enough to know what's good you have to love the good it's not enough to you know to care so think oh my you're not a Vulcan you know it's not enough to say how my wife has these wonderful qualities you got to love your wife you know you love your your mom and you got to love your country because this is what I want to get to patriotism patriotism patriotism is a natural passion you shouldn't be afraid of your patriotism every person loves the place that he comes from but of course you want your patriotism to be informed with the good what is good about your country and there might come a time there might come a time when you find oh my god my country is doing something so evil that my passion has to be redirected I have to curtail my passion but what would a man be like a woman would be like if he didn't love his country that'd be something twisted and wrong with you the other day I was trying to quote this poem by Walter Scott and I can never quote anything from memory I just haven't got the capability of memorizing things but the lay of the last minstrel let me read this to you listen to what Walter Scott one of the kind of forgotten great writers he was just a fantastic writer and he's kind of gone out of style for temporarily but he talks about what what it would be like to have no patriotism he says breathe there the man with soul so dead who never to himself hath said this is my own my native land whose heart hath never with an umber Nazz home his footsteps he have turned from wandering on a foreign strand if such there breathe go mark him well for him no minstrel rap stirs swell poets are not going to sing about this guy because he doesn't his country high though his titles proud his name boundless is will wealth as wish can claim despite those titles power and health the wretch concentrated all in self living shall forfeit fair renown and doubly dying shall go down to the vile death dust from whence he sprung unwept unhonored and unsung he is not worthy of remembering he is nothing because he doesn't have this natural passion this natural love of country you're not supposed to hate yourself you're not supposed to hate the fact that you like looking at women in bikinis you're not supposed to hate the fact that you love your mom you're not supposed to hate the fact that you love your country that the left is trying to school you to that they say oh you know you like looking at women you're objectifying women you're you're a patriot that's jingoism that's the that's what nationalism and tribalism no no you're supposed to love your country it is one of the good things about you you have to simply train it to the good attach it to the good compare what Walter Scott said about the Patriot compare it with this that's not loving your country how would it be if before a wedding five days away from the guy's wedding he said I am fundamentally five days away from fundamentally transforming this woman you know what would and women do that too you know five days well I am fundamentally what five days away from fundamentally transforming this men that is not love that is not patriotism you love you love your country you love your country and of course that means you know and you know what love means because you love yourself right you let yourself off the hook a little bit you overlook some of your bad qualities you try to make yourself better you work on yourself these are all things we do in love you know so you love your country in the same way you love yourself same where you love your mom all these things and it drives me nuts that they tell us that the patriotism is bad so okay the NFL this is you know and all these people especially the intellectuals on the right this also drives me a little crazy they tell us these things don't matter they say oh you know politics is downstream from cultures that don't care about the NFL Paulo Street sticks is politics is downstream from culture but don't care what Samantha bee says why are you worried about that that's the culture that is the culture that is the culture that affects the narrative that affects who gets elected 20 years from now right I mean a guy as an essential socialist like Obama would never have been elected president once let alone twice if we haven't been trained to look at somebody talking like that and and looking like that to some degree as a presidential candidate that he looked like the candidate we'd been told would be good he was not a good candidate speaking of which Father's Day you know fought one of the things about being a father is teaching

having won the Super Bowl we're supposed to come to the White House to celebrate and at the last minute they canceled out Trump got mad and said well instead we're going to have a celebration of our flag and we're going to talk about you know why we salute the flag and I but he said that's not fair because the Eagles didn't kneel during the season they didn't kneel protest the flag but but they did pull this thing where they said oh only 10 of us and some said only one of one of the Eagles was going to show up and they said it at the last minute so it was political it was striking back at Trump for his flag you know argument that he was having with the NFL and for the fact that the NFL was forced to cave by the people because Trump stirred up the people so it was about the flag it's not fair to say that the Eagles were completely innocent in this so Trump gets up and he gives a speech and everybody starts yelling you know that this is this is ridiculous this is not about patriotism what I want to say what I want to tell you here is this that this they want to say that this is about race but it really is about patriotism and yes patriotism because it's a passion can be abused in the same way your desire for a woman or a man can be abused passions can be abused that's why you have to train them to the good it's not about hating your passions it is about training them to the good but I want to go back 2014 the Olympics and I just want to point out that the left has been preaching against patriotism itself their training you to hate your natural passions your natural loves I want to just show you this this is the Olympics right this is the one that was in Sochi Salt Lake City was it oh because it was an American thing that's right it was American sorry thank you very much and this is Matt Lauer cereal woman abuser and Katie Couric and they're interviewing athletes listen really carefully to how they are they are dictating the narrative right the athletes aren't saying anything about patriotism they are telling them how they have to feel about patriotism which is you don't want to go too far with it you don't want to do too much listen but you're expecting even a greater wave of patron here in the United States in this particular time then other countries have shown when they posted the games well you know I don't know than other countries but I certainly expect the stands to be rocking I expect the flags to be flying and you know the expression of patriotism is fine for any country that hosts the Olympics we want to express our nationalism as a part of the world's community and I expect to see that but we have to also be careful and draw a line not to let our patriotism get in the way of the games in general obviously the opening ceremony the the games themselves will be very patriotic and feel and yet sometimes the international community can interpret that as arrogant nationalism obviously you've got a balance those two things are you all clearly you're mindful of that how are you how are you going to do that can you mean the Olympics is where countries compete so your country is your team can you imagine saying to somebody go to the Yankees game don't look too hard for the Yankees you know get Boston a little a little love you know you know I mean that's not the way Sports works that's not the way countries work that's not the way passion works you're supposed to passionately love your country it doesn't mean you don't criticize her it doesn't mean you don't have to make her better all the time just as you like yourself and as hopefully you like the people you like you know you try and you do want to tell them when they're messing up but you love them you get cut them slack you invest your passion in them listen plus-plus they don't know what they're talking about CNN's Angela Wray comes on and she says you know that the national anthem is problematic in and of itself okay see this is the thing I'm saying that they keep trying to blame this on Trump they keep saying that Trump started this but they started it they started a long long time before Trump got there they started it when they started telling us that our passion for our country our love for our country was bad per se that's when this started here is Angela Rai telling us that the national anthem is problematical in and of itself let's be really really honest here that's what he can't handle the ego below instead of having people around him that are not yes men and yes women and yes people he has people that continue to lie on his behalf the Eagles didn't volunteer not to go they uninvited the Eagles that's the issue that this is all about his ego and we're going to now end up in a midterm we're talking about the national anthem the national anthem is problematic in and of itself there's a second verse that Colin Kapernick brought attention to that has yet to be discussed on broad platforms in addition to that people have every right to go through the practices of practicing free speech I didn't mean to say practice twice but the bottom line is we have the opportunity to say this is something that's bothering me until this country serves me the same way that it serves so many other people I have a right to protest and you should pay attention to what those issues are you're a real leader that thing about the national anthem is total garbage by the way she was talking about the third verse not the second verse here it is Isis remembers the war of 1812 Battle of Fort Henry we win the battle we're fighting the British the song goes and where is that band who so vauntingly swore that the havoc of war and the battles confusion a home and a country should leave us no more this is such a badly written song it really is but he said says where's the band that swore that they would destroy our country their blood has washed out their foul footsteps pollution no refuge could save the hot could no refuge could save the hireling and slave from the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave and the Stahl's star-spangled banner in triumph thoughtfully so she thinks and Colin Kapernick think that that reference to slaves is to the slaves that were held in the south and they're the slave nothing can save them from the terror of flight the hireling 'he's there are the mercenaries the German mercenaries that the British would use and the slaves are the impressed they used to impress people into the into the service in the Navy so if you're out wandering drunk one night a couple of guys would come grab you under the shoulders hurl you want to ship and you were in the Navy that was how the British got a lot of their people in the Navy those are the slaves that he's talking about this dump is just dopey all right so anyway you know they keep saying that the and and the other argument she makes is that this is about free speech if it's about free speech I want to know if the left is about free speech I want to know why that cake baker who wouldn't bake a cake for Halloween because he was a Christian who wouldn't bake a cake with adult themes as they call them because if sexy themes because he was a Christian when he said I will not decorate a cake it for a gay wedding why that was wrong why it was okay for someone not to decorate a cake in against gay marriage but when he wanted to decorate a cake for gay marriage and who refused that was not okay they were trying to tell him what to think what to say so they're not about free speech it has nothing to do with free speech nobody is curtailing these guys from protesting my only argument with them is their protest is their protest should should be we love this country but it's not living up to its standards here's why in which case okay I'll listen I might not agree but I'll listen but if what you're saying is but then if that's what you're saying salute the flag because you love the country if what you're saying is this country stinks and we don't love you then to hell with you I don't care what you think all right Father's Day you know all I'm trying to say is that they've been attacking they have been attacking our patriotism our passions just like they're attacking our passion for looking at women in bathing suits that's not the problem with us we are not supposed to dislike who we are or what we are or our own humanity we're just supposed to train our passions and our desires for the good hey get ready because we have a special treat for our audience in honor of Father's Day this

YouTube so don't miss it so while we're talking about patriotism and the things people do for patriotism today is d-day if you think people go to war because they because they admire their country or you think they go to war because they've thought it out they sit in the library and they think yes you know my country is good it really is you know those things inform their passion but they go to war for they go to war for passion for love of country love of the things that we have here which is there's a lot of love here and they went to war in 1944 June 6 1944 fighting a truly evil and disastrous enemy that would have taken over the world they were the Nazis and their and their axis you know partners would have taken over the world if America had not stood up to them and joined with our allies in France and Britain and around the world to fight them back and these got you know I remember as a kid I had a junior high school teacher who was at d-day he stormed the Normandy Beach and I remember him talking telling us about it and talking about the carpet of bodies that he ran over - as he was charging these machine guns and they were just raking the beach I'm sure you've seen Saving Private Ryan the opening scene of that they were just raking the beach and he said he was when anyone he talked he was full of what and now I would recognize as PTSD is kind of his new tone got impassioned he fell over his words we should not forget this you know let's just take a listen to CNN to the special where they interviewed some of the veterans and they remembered what happened the front went down and we jumped into the water the water was up to our necks we weren't the first troops the inventory was first we were the mortar following the infantry and the bodies were all over the place first thing I had in my mind was death I was thinking about that I think I was gonna come back because there was a lot of guys all around me they were floating in the water there was one kid I looked down and there was Michaels as they was and he's trying to talk and nothing was coming out and he was I made him up to say help me but things were so chaotic there you couldn't help anybody I had to get out of there a group of four of us we headed up and we go through a minefield the whole area was mined so as we Traverse on this high ground I hip up and in my peripheral vision I see this fellow to my left an explosion on him flying through the air and I just kept going as fast as I could yeah I just kept going as fast as I could you know there's this book one day I'm gonna do a whole show about this as Howard's in people's history of the United States and he says I want to tell the history of the United States from its point of view of the victims I want to tell the about the Constitution from the point of view of slaves but what if I did that to you have just told the worst parts of your lives the truth is the truth is there's not a single person walking around who politically free on the planet Earth who is not free because of people like this you know yesterday I guess it was yesterday Monday we had it's now Wednesday right and that Monday we had jacob ariane we were talking about comic books and he said millennials feel they have no great enterprise like this to participate in but you know this is a great enterprise fighting back evil once the evil is gone the great enterprises are to produce more good more children raise your children that's a big enterprise a mighty enterprise settle planets extend freedom through the world that's what we're here to do and it's all because of guys like this and their passion and their love of country believe me believe me it's not the Matt Lauer's and Katie Couric's of the world who go out and do this stuff it's the people who love their country alright you know I'm reading this really chilling true crime book about the Golden State killer it's by you know my camera members called I'll be I'll be gone in

over for the mailbag alright the mailbag the Lyndsey put up a picture of her baby or daughter on Twitter gorgeous kid what a beautiful which of course she was gorgeous in it makes perfect sense from dawn greetings master Clavin I have highly enjoyed mr. Shapiro's Sunday specials and found a recent remark by dr. Drew thoroughly thought provoking and craved your response to his premise the pair discussed the role of human sacrifice throughout human history and dr. Drew stated this innate desire is satisfied presently from any Westerners by Christ as a human sacrifice extending to the sacrament of communion as a cannibalistic act please illuminate for me how this anthropological insight relates to the veracity of our faith eternally grateful Don you know one of the through lines of the Bible is about sacrifice and about human sacrifice and kind of you know I read the Bible as a developing story it's a history so things change and people's understanding deepens and God gives us more information as we are prepared by our history to understand it so it's not like every minute everything is coming at us all at once the very first thing God does when he creates the Jewish people is he takes it he says to Abraham go sacrifice your son Isaac goes to sacrifice the son Isaac and God says what are you doing he says well you told me to stop doing that don't do that here is a goat sacrifice the goat instead up until that point human beings are sacrificing their sons and all through the Bible all through the Bible when you hear somebody and he did what was wrong in the eyes of God which is all the kings of Israel who are doing all the wrong thing what they're doing that is they're going back to the celebration that worship a Baal who demands the sacrifice of sons but that moment is the moment when God chooses his people and says you know do not sacrifice use a symbol instead okay that's really really important because all of life is simple all of life is simple we symbolize who we are our flesh symbolizes our being right if people think like well what you know isn't the soul some kind of shadowy ghost inside it no no you are the language that speaks your soul your flesh is the language that speaks your soul and God is training us to understand that the entire idea of parables you ever think why Jesus speaks in parables people think well a story it makes a point better no he's telling you that the things that happen have meaning right when you the very act of understanding a parable is understanding that the things that happen have meaning the same with sacrifice we feel guilty or we feel what like we want to control things so we sacrifice to God and we're sacrificing our kids and God says no sacrifice a symbol and then he that prepares us for his sacrifice is sacrifice of his son Jesus for us because essentially God is self-sufficient he can take care of our guilt he can take care of our sin in his in his own sacrifice to himself he takes sacrifice out of our hands and does it once for all and he has first trained us to that through indicating how symbols work how ritual works how ceremony works and then he does that real thing that is leading us it is showing us through the flesh of Jesus through the flesh of Jesus it is taking us in to the meaning of life so the whole thing about sacrifice I mean that's why you know they oh I've said this many times but it's important they call Satan the accuser I think that it is even what it means we are not supposed to wallow in our guilt this is another thing that the left it's teaching us to hate ourselves it says well you held slaves you think yes but then we stopped you know and and the people who did it were guilty some of them should be punished certainly an entire civilization I was gone with the wind' after the civil war but now we haven't done that the only thing we can do is go forward and let the guilt trail off behind us as we go forward without treating people that way that human sacrifice has been taken care of it's done and it's done forever and that's a through-line in the bottle from jonathan questions greeting oh lord Clavin the king of humor and hater of ease while i have great hope for american culture in the coming decades i have far less confidence about our European friends how do you see the European situation developing culturally in the next 10 years do you think it can make a comeback or will it be doomed to be divided between the far left and ultra ultra nationalist groups you know I have said this but I think it's important it's important to understand the world that we're in today to understand that Europe is dead and Western Europe certainly I mean Eastern Europe you say well there's nationalist movements there there's extreme nationalism if it's it comes to that it too will be dead you know but but if if what they're doing is pushing patriotism if they're learning freedom having been having suffered and been delayed and coming to freedom by the Communist slave states that conquered them if they do that then they might be alright they may re-energize the rest of Europe Western Europe is dead when you are letting people in who do not believe in your values and you're letting them sweep into your towns and villages rape your women and then you're prosecuting people for revealing for reporting that they're raping your women your country is dead your culture is dead you are no longer producing the great works any more it is just being devoured by these invaders who are coming into the country it's not about the fact that like this doesn't mean that every one of them is bad it means and Europe has lost the plot of its own existence and so I think that's important so when it's important because so many people are selling us european-style governance the european-style socialism european-style pacifism but you know part of being alive is fighting for yourself part of being alive is is arguing and screaming and demanding things and being self-reliant and and having inequalities in equality is a part of life you know when dead people are all the same slaves were all the same free people are different free people that rise some rise some fall all the things that the Left hates about us are part of the fact that we are alive and and I think we have to understand that you're as dead look can it come back to life of course there's a history it's not biology the dead civilizations do rise again they do have a second birth I kind of believe that what's gonna happen is Europe is going to become an adjunct of us and and that in that they'll have some kind of second secondary shadow-like than the one they have now right this minute this is a culture that simply doesn't even believe in its own existence dear Lex Luthor that is not one of my title being a writer of various things like novels screenplays and podcasts have you ever thought of writing a comic book or graphic novel as stuff the art nerds like to call them as from Jack I didn't write one and I got burned I wrote one called Jenny in the darkness it is a really good story you can go on Amazon and see that jacket a young woman in Poland did the illustrations they were beautiful the company basically just disappeared they paid us maybe as someone some of what they owed us but not all of it and they vanished and now I can't get the rights back even though the company doesn't exist I mean I guess I can get the rights back somehow but I I don't know I don't know how to go about it it's very difficult to do and so I've lost this this part of the story I may do it again as a novel or as a screenplay it's a really good story I enjoyed doing it I loved the work it was lots of fun I would do it again but I'd have to do it with a company that wasn't fly-by-night apparently this happens a lot in the comic book business I was taking really taken aback by from Andrew I am not feeling very hunky dunky when I was younger I did not consider the importance of morals values and ethics I didn't view those things as the foundation on top of which a strong relationship can be built is what we're talking about training your passions to the good as I should have I am now 30 and have left my old perspective in the past I've committed myself to living in virtuous life however I'm not convinced my girlfriend shares the same views on these subjects her viewpoints are malleable and easily influenced because I'm dating to marry instead of just dating to date I wonder what I can do about this she often tells me she's committed to the same principles because she follows some of the same thought leaders I follow such as you then Jordan Pederson christina hoff sommers we are 7 months into our relationship I'm feeling non-committal I'm looking for I'm not looking for an ideological twin but I do believe some very basic moralistic values should be in alignment for a healthy relationship to be realized should I hold out or hope hope for change or simply move on yo I don't have enough information to make to answer your question so I'm gonna have to speak generally like I do not know what kind of values you're talking about specifically values are important they're important in a relationship you know you can't you're not gonna get along with somebody who for instance if you think she should be an at-home mother and she thinks no that's the last thing I want to do that is not a good basis for a marriage and you're not gonna get along with somebody if she believes in open marriage and you believe in fidelity right that's not gonna work you know there a person can be you know I I don't agree that this is necessarily moral but it personally be a generally good person and say well I believe in open marriage I'm gonna be very honest about what we're gonna do here and that's the way it's gonna be that may be a mistake right it may even be a moral mistake but it doesn't mean the person is doing something evil because he's telling you that's the way those are the rules of the game but if the other person thinks it's he's in a faithful relationship and she's running around that's not gonna work so I don't know but but other things for instance you can get along with you can get along with somebody who votes differently if that's not like a very you know if you're not totally you know far ends of the scale you can get along with people of different attitudes toward money though that can lead to a lot of clashes as well but it doesn't have to one person may say you know what I just need a certain amount of money the other person may be more ambitious you can you can meld those things together so I don't know what values you're talking about but but values matter and if and you should talk them through and and decide what you mean is she doesn't have to believe everything you have you believe but you better know especially because kids will come as they have a tendency to do you better know what you're gonna be teaching those kids and what she is gonna be doing too and don't kid yourself about it she may say she's malleable she may say what you want to hear but that may not but that may not be the truth you got it you gonna have to judge from been dear Andrew you often say that grief is the price we pay for love that is true last weekend I lost a very close friend I'm sorry to hear that I've been trying to deal with the loss I have been blessed to have a life filled with the love of my wife friends and family so I know that eventually this will be something I have to deal with again my question is this are there any strategies you have specifically for dealing with loss and what is the best way that I can be there for others who are feeling the same way I am well one of the things I also say I do say that grief is the price for love of course of is we live in a life that we live a life that ends but I also sometimes say that grief is a desert that has to be crossed on foot which by which I mean there is no hurrying grief you have to get over it as you get over it but you do have to take the journey you do have to walk through it you don't just sit there and wallow in it you know just fold your tent you don't cross your legs and sit in the sand you walk across that desert moving and you keep going forward and you acknowledge your grief you acknowledge your grief I you know one of the things that I have found really helpful in times of grieving that I find this helpful all the time but especially in times of grieving I find prayer immensely interest immensely helpful because I want to know I want to know your thing it really is a good metaphor you're crossing a desert but where are you gonna come out you know you're gonna come out in a wasteland or you're gonna come out in Holland do you think about someplace good you want to come out someplace good you want to come out deeper richer wiser and those are the things that you want to bring to your family bring to your friends I mean that's part of what being a friend is part of what being a father is is leading people to themselves leading people to become their best selves leaving people to the the person that God made them to be and that is what you want your grief to do you are taking a journey you want to get to the right place you don't want to get to a place of bitterness you don't want to get to a place of Anil ISM you want to get to a place of faith and trust and and now and greater knowledge of life and those are the only things I can tell you because the pain nothing I say is gonna make the pain less nothing I say is gonna make the pain last any shorter period of time usually they say about a year it takes about a year that has been my experience as well you do come out of it and you just have to keep that journey going keep walking forward and doing what's right and trying to figure out what this means what it means to you what it means about life what it means about God and then they spread those around and and to teach those things to the people you teach one more from Sam Oh captain my Clavin in art and architecture school in art and archives this is weird in art and architecture school I was constantly taught by leftist faculty that is better to judge the process of design and critique the product of design itself that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard but it is leftism right it's a lot less than your intentions or what matter not what what you actually accomplish I saw many of my fellow students get away with horrible designs by justifying it with their process of course you did one teacher told us that we could present our project as a blank sheet of paper as long as we can convince him that we thought long and hard about it another architecture perfect well you know what's what's wrong with this is same thing that's wrong with leftism and general leftism is the same way you say well my intentions were good doesn't matter that Baltimore descended into chaos because I really meant well you know and that's why I always quote the famous saying the road to hell is paved with good intentions and how powerful the saying that is I mean this is utter nonsense you do you don't do art for yourself art is a form of communication you're trying to communicate something you it doesn't come from you it is given to you and it is you are giving it to somebody else so what the hell difference does your process make what difference you know let me let me give you an example of how this how deep this goes I believe that you should do a thing for its inner meaning you should do a thing for its inner worth right so I approach my writing I don't approach my writing to make money though I hope to make money I approach my writing to communicate beauty and delight and hopefully wisdom right not the wisdom that comes from me the wisdom that comes through me into the writing I do it for that reason the guy next to me may do it just for money he may not care he just says hey I'm just do this for it for you know for the lark and I can make a good money off if there's a big market for what I do so I'm gonna do it the guy next to me may be Shakespeare and he's still gonna write Shakespeare and I'm gonna write what I write which is not gonna be as good as Shakespeare though it's great it really is great you should try it but it but it's not gonna be Shakespeare the difference is I'm going to be joyful because I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing I'm gonna be joyful he's gonna be a cynic but he's still gonna be Shakespeare so it has nothing to do with the quality but the quality is the is what matters in the end right you have to do it right you have to do something that communicates what you're trying to communicate that's what art is that what they're teaching you is nonsense it's nonsense the process the process may give you joy and that's important but it is nonsense that that's all that matters or that it should be judged on the process that so it's a way of getting out of your responsibility it's a way of getting out of your responsibility to do what's right the left does this all the time I mean look at their crummy cities that they turn to cesspits of homelessness and poverty and crime and they say yes but you're racist because you don't believe the things that I believe it's nonsense all right tickety-boo news I wanted to get to this yesterday and I didn't have time but it was a column in The Wall Street Journal next to my column that yes in yesterday's Wall Street Journal climate change has run its course this is by Steven F Hayward he's a resident scholar at the Institute of governmental studies at the University of California at Berkeley and he says climate change is over no I'm not saying the climate will not change in the future that human influence on the climate is negligible I mean simply that climate change is no longer a preeminent policy issue is boilerplate rhetoric from the political class frivolous nuisance lawsuits and bureaucratic mandates on behalf of special interests renewable energy rent seekers he notices the way this issue has decayed the way it has fallen apart as people started to realize that the price of fixing certain things was so high it would have essentially destroyed civilization and instead it was used by the left as a an umbrella under which to sell their policies this is a good indicator of what listen this is great as is what I love a good indicator of why climate change as an issue is over can be found early in the text of the Paris agreement the non-binding pact declares that climate action must include concern for gender equality empowerment of women and intergenerational equity as well as the importance for some of the concept of climate justice because you know that if you don't have gender equity the Sun gets hotter this is how this is true there's a physical price you do not if you are not a feminist the Sun gets hotter and hotter until everybody dies if you are a feminist the Sun cools that that's how that's the communication between people in the Sun also human sacrifice helps so hurts this issue had become a vehicle for causing panic in panic as Rahm Emanuel taught us you don't let a crisis go to waste in panic people will give up their freedoms that's what it was all about that doesn't mean I actually believe of course we should take care of our environment of course we should follow the science and see what we have to do to keep to keep the environment good our climate working but think about it for just a minute they won't they won't pay attention he says this in the article they won't pay attention to nuclear energy which is so clean and so useful because there's there it doesn't fit in with their green idea so all they do is attack fossil fuels which we need to run a civilization so they're not serious about it until they get serious about it we don't have to have a serious response but ultimately you know we will have to face the environment make sure that our the things we do do not destroy the planet obviously we all want that and by the way I think we will do it once once the leftist get out of the way I think the technology will come about and we will take it's not that I don't think there are climate threats but I don't think the climate movement will deal with them that's what I'm saying I think they're just left this spreading panic and creating crisis so we'll surrender to what they want that's it all right me back tomorrow we have Selena zero right the Oh excellent Selena zero she wrote the great revolt and about the the Trump coalition and we will be talking to her and so many other things I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show the Andrew
