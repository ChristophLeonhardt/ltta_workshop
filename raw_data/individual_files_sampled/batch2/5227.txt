the Center for Disease Control estimates that more than 72,000 Americans died of drug overdoses last year now think about it that's a greater number than all the lives that were lost during the entire decade-long Vietnam War a new investigative piece last night on 60 minutes noted that while both the Trump and Obama administrations have sent hundreds of doctors to jail for their roles in the opioid crisis so far not one executive of an opioid manufacturer or distributor has been sentenced to a single day in jail as a pharmaceutical industry comes under increased scrutiny a lot of people are starting to wonder is a Washington Post editorial board recently did if Congress is doing enough to get it one of the root causes of this epidemic with us now to talk about that and much more someone who has devoted himself to calling attention to the opioid crisis but selling author and a host of America on CR TV eric bolling he's alongside Diana DeLaGarza she is a mother of singer Demi Lovato who called her own battle with addiction quote not something that disappears or fades with time also with us back with us again leading spine surgeon and founder of the online health newsletter thrive dr. Dave Campbell he's the author of the teen formula a parent's guide to helping your child avoid substance abuse I want to get to Diana and Eric in a minute but first dr. Dave I saw the 60 minute special last night and even as a guy from Florida who knows Florida I was blown away by the fact that something like 500 million opioid tablets came in to the state of Florida I the pharmaceutical companies flooded this state and guaranteed a healthcare epidemic yeah and this is now fortunately getting under control thanks to actions such as state attorney de verre Amber and even the governor and some of the legislate legislation over the last few years Florida was the pill mill capital of the United States it is not now now and Eric I'm sure you saw the 60 minutes special last night and I mean if you're a parent like yourself who's lost a child to this epidemic and you see that pharmaceutical companies are flooded again I mean 500 million pills coming into the state of Florida that's happening all across the United States bad actors with an MD at the end of their name basically being pill mills for for Americans it's unconscionable what do we do and what do you tell the President to do when you're talking to him very very good question Joe in fact I did watch that and I did see a doctor who had little or no remorse after prescribing at one point a thousand opioid tablets to a pregnant woman people were dying so what's happening is it and what we're doing here is we're trying to create awareness yes pharmaceuticals have been pumping opioid pills into doctors what are doctors going to do they're gonna turn around and prescribe them they're gonna make sales doctors are at fault pharmaceuticals are at fault but also there's a lot of illegal opioids coming across the border that we've talked about my son passed away after taking one pill he was in college he bought what he thought was a xanax it was laced with fentanyl a Chinese knockoff and it killed him that night so it's multifaceted and I think what's important Joe is that you know you talk about Demi Lovato you talk about the story after in the aftermath of Demi's you know high profile overdose diana de la garza called me and said look i want to get involved in this this is a scourge that's that's killing and hurting too many of our children how can I do this and she said soon as Demi's out you know soon as Danny Demi is safe and feeling okay we're gonna we're gonna team up and that's what we did I think I think the awareness that people have to understand here are two parents who like any other parents in the world love their kids right and then things happen and you have to be vigilant you have to be aware you have to have your discussions and you have to create awareness and that's where a trap what I wanted to bring dianna on to create awareness to millions of people so that we can save some lives and diana it is an ongoing battle anyone with a loved one who has an addiction problem knows that it is for a lifetime it is a fight that you battle five minutes at a time yeah and addiction is actually a disease it's not a moral choice like so many people may have been led to think and so that's also something that you know I I want to raise awareness and let people know that you know at the addiction that is fueling the opioid crisis is something that needs to be looked at and you know provide ways for people to get help very good and that have had addiction problems and it is boy I'll tell you what Eric it is sad you you realize it's a disease and it's something that everybody around around the loved one they have to come together and be patient and try to help any way they can so Joe you were amazing when we lost our son you called Adrian I so many times but here's the point that I think we're trying to see if two different situations you're talking from an addiction at one point you're talking from an accidental overdose on another situation but here we need to remove the stigma of addiction and overdosing and drug dependence we need to make people aware that it can touch anyone I can't tell you how many parents have said I thought my son or my daughter was just too popular too smart too athletic too white to black too gay to straight to whatever but they were touched by it opioids and drugs are killing our youth we need to remove the stigma and I think that's the force that's what we can do I'm frankly I'll be honest with you Joe I think Congress isn't doing enough I think the White House can do more and I've been pushing them to do more to remove the stigma they're very good in enforcing they're not very good at removing the stigma and that's really important well and as long as the Justice Department as long as Congress only focuses on doctors who are bad actors dr. Dave instead of folk on the farthest pharmaceutical companies that are pumping pills into states that are making a massive profit on it we're not gonna get to the root cause of this problem it's an evolving problem also Jo 2018 we're seeing a dramatic spike in the synthetic opioids coming from China up through Mexico literally with postal services bringing in drugs and the new Senate and House opioid bill does address that so this is an evolving crisis that is much different today than it was in 2010 we've seen synthetic opioids now responsible for 30,000 deaths last year that's dramatic 72,000 total deaths but 30,000 fentanyl and some of the fentanyl analogues so joke I just jump in here very quickly the the I sat down with Kirsten Nielsen the homeland security secretary and she addressed that I said what are you doing about the Postal Service's she said they're literally tens of millions of dollars that are earmarked for upgrading how the Postal Service reviews the packages that are coming through the US Postal System again three grains of salt can kill a human being it's an it's really really crazy that they need to work on that so they're working out but they need they need to focus a lot more attention a lot more resources frankly hey guys it's Donnie Daniel I'm so sorry what you went through an eric man i haven't smoked in a long time i just your loss i can't my brother i got a 15 year old who's just going out in the world now and you know we have these talks where i'll say things the best i got is I know you an experiment everything in moderation how do what's what's the playbook obviously you've been digging deep into this what what do I say to my daughter because I know she's the thing that happened here your son is just could happen to I had that conversation with Eric chase a hundred times a hundred times just in moderation just because that's my person give me a better playbook got this dad here's your playbook what's your son's name or your daughter's name London London one pill can kill look at my story my son bought ones annex sophomore in college great kids lots of friends took one they need to understand taking one pill from the wrong place can kill frankly there's another kid at the University of Denver University about 20 miles from universe Colorado nineteen year old son of a military a Navy I think an admiral died the same night it was likely a bad batch of xanax laced with fentanyl one pill you put it in your mouth you don't know what's gonna happen and and that's a problem day for doctor Dave this this is a you look at Diana's Diana's challenges it has to do with addiction something that we've all dealt with with loved ones before you you look at it what happened with Eric and it was one pill it's what I tell my kids after talking to Eric one pill can kill but for those on the addiction side of this which is such a problem there is hope talk talk about talk about what's being done right now to help people get off of opioids yeah prevention Falls both on the young people to prevent the naive kid who's never used opioids very importantly on the treatment and recovery side so giving recovery support services and making sure everyone understands that this new batch of pills that may be used for fun or actually poison now and they weren't ten years ago and and in narcan you say is the antidote is widely available it needs to be made more widely available so that we can save lives so that we can offer recovery support services to those valuable individuals that have just come on hard times all right Eric thank you so much as always come back Diana thank you and dr.
