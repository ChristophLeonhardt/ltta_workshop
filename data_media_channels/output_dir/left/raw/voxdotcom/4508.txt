1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,440
Listen to how this textbook describes slavery.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,120
“The master often had a barbecue or a picnic
for his slaves.

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:08,769
Then they had a great frolic.

4
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:11,760
Even while working in the cotton fields they
sang songs.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,360
The beat of the music and the richness of
their voices made work seem light.”

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,370
Yikes.

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,840
That’s from History of Georgia, a textbook
published in 1954 that was taught across junior

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,070
high schools in Georgia for decades.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,359
That sort of language is part of an intellectual
movement called the “Lost Cause” — a

10
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,479
distorted version of American Civil War history
that’s been prevalent in the South for a

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,550
long time.

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,450
It took shape soon after the defeat of the
Confederate States in the war, when Southern

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,210
historians like Edward Pollard and former
Confederate Gen. Jubal Early started preserving

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,490
the South’s perspective through their writings.

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,260
They framed the Confederate cause as a heroic
defense of the Southern way of life against

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,370
the overwhelming forces in the North.

17
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,740
That narrative has a few basic tenets: the
glorification of Confederate soldiers who

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,890
died for a cause they believed in, the belief
that slavery was a benevolent institution,

19
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,670
and, maybe most importantly, that slavery
was not the root cause of the war.

20
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,600
The Lost Cause is one of the most notoriously
effective efforts to rewrite history, and

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,440
it was done by the losing side.

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,110
So how did it become so deeply rooted in Southern
memory?

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,870
Blame the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

24
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,950
The UDC was founded in Nashville in 1894 to
preserve Confederate culture for generations

25
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,950
to come.

26
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,720
The women who made up the group descended
from elite antebellum families and they used

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,520
their social and political clout to spread
the pro-Southern version of the war as “real

28
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
history.”

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,720
You’ve probably seen their efforts to honor
the Confederacy, but maybe you didn’t know

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
it was the UDC.

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,590
They’re the ones who covered the Southern
landscape with memorials for Confederate leaders

32
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,590
and soldiers.

33
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,370
They used their fundraising and lobbying skills
to pressure local governments into erecting

34
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,340
monuments in prominent public spaces like
courthouses and state capitols.

35
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,380
Installed here next to the state Capitol by
the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

36
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,230
The United Daughters of the Confederacy donated
this memorial to the city back in the ’30s.

37
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,910
They put them along roadsides and in parks.

38
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,630
Any place that was remotely relevant to the
Confederacy was memorialized.

39
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:13,360
By the early 20th century, the UDC had 100,000
members in chapters spread all over the country,

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,730
but mostly in former Confederate states.

41
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,120
And there’s a reason they grew so quickly
during that time.

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,550
So we’re talking about roughly three decades
after the end of the war, and the Confederate

43
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,760
veterans themselves are beginning to die off.

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,340
So there is this push to find ways to commemorate
it.

45
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,700
Because the big challenge by 1900 was there’s
a new generation of white Southerners being

46
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,860
born and they never experienced the war years.

47
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,310
That push is visible.

48
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,099
Most of the Confederate monuments were erected
during the UDC’s height of influence.

49
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,400
There’s a rhetoric around monuments — that
we want to get this thing built before all

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
of that generation has died off. And

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,980
Dr. Karen Cox wrote the book on the UDC, and
I asked her if it was fair to say the group

52
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,360
established the Lost Cause as historical fact
in the South.

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,819
Oh, my God, yeah!

54
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:08,060
They were the leaders of the Lost Cause into
the 20th century, and they made it a movement

55
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,560
about vindication.

56
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,481
Just to give you an idea of how effective
they were: They successfully lobbied for a

57
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:18,050
Confederate Memorial in Arlington National
Cemetery, which US President Woodrow Wilson

58
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,319
proudly unveiled to a cheering crowd.

59
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,200
Now that’s influence, right?

60
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,880
Monuments are the least of what they did.

61
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,150
I mean they are the most visible and tangible,
but the work with children was far more influential.

62
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,940
It turns out, a central UDC objective is shaping
how children think about the war and their

63
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,950
Southern heritage.

64
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,250
One of their most powerful tools?

65
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,250
Textbooks.

66
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,099
Take a look at this pamphlet, called “A
Measuring Rod for Text-Books.”

67
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,980
It was written by “the illustrious Southern
Historian Miss Mildred Rutherford” an educator,

68
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,030
orator, and an author of Southern history
textbooks.

69
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,730
She was also very pro-slavery.

70
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,660
The pamphlet announced the formation of a
textbook review committee featuring prominent

71
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,099
Southerners, like five former Confederate
generals.

72
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,160
This group was committed to spreading the
“truths of Confederate history” so they

73
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,560
instructed school boards to reject any textbooks
that did not “accord full justice to the

74
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,480
South.”

75
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,660
And they urged libraries to deface every book
in their collection that didn’t measure

76
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,440
up by writing the words “Unjust to the South”
clearly on its cover.

77
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,719
This pamphlet was shared widely with school
boards throughout the South, and UDC-backed

78
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:22,520
committees closely monitored history books
to make sure “Northern influence” never

79
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,879
reached classrooms.

80
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,370
So the core language of an approved textbook
aligned precisely with that of the Lost Cause.

81
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,379
You know, stuff like “The Confederacy lost
in the War between the States.

82
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:37,089
But Georgia never forgot to honor her Confederate
soldiers…”

83
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:39,409
History of Georgia was on the UDC’s approved
list.

84
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:44,029
It was also written by E. Merton Coulter,
a self-described “Southern historian”

85
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,350
and historian-described white supremacist.

86
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,949
They understand that how you educate — who
wins the writing game, who wins the battle

87
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:54,750
over history — ultimately wins the war.

88
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,680
That’s the big fight for the UDC.

89
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,460
But their work with children went further
than the classrooms.

90
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,869
The UDC formed an auxiliary group called the
Children of the Confederacy, which was designed

91
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:08,220
to get kids born in former Confederate states
to actively participate in their version of

92
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,220
history.

93
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,339
Group leaders had kids recite call-and-response
“truths” from something called the “Confederate

94
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:14,339
Catechism.”

95
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:18,860
Children, up to the age of 18, would compete
and be rewarded for memorizing long passages

96
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,199
of Lost Cause rhetoric.

97
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,809
So it would be like an after-school thing,
you know, like that was your club.

98
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:28,439
You would go after school to the meeting of
the Children of the Confederacy and your leader

99
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:34,419
might teach you songs of the South like “Dixie”
or other songs that were considered Southern

100
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:35,800
patriotic songs.

101
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,439
They would have them write essays, go visit
the veterans, and learn this catechism.

102
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,349
Children were also the centerpiece of their
community’s monument unveilings, like this

103
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:48,779
“living flag” at the dedication of the
Stonewall Jackson monument in Richmond.

104
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:50,050
Yes, those are schoolchildren.

105
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,039
The UDC's efforts shaped the identities of
children who grew up with the Lost Cause.

106
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,180
They made history personal, and that made
their story last longer.

107
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,740
Generations of generations of children learning
that narrative in a variety of ways grow up

108
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,139
to be, you know, segregationists in the ’50s
and ’60s.

109
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,330
Because that’s been drilled into them since
they were children.

110
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,339
After World War I, the UDC started losing
steam.

111
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,640
But the damage was done.

112
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,649
The monuments were in place and the textbooks
they wrote remained in Southern classrooms

113
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:19,129
until the late ’70s.

114
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,040
And the women’s group did it all without
the right to vote or participate in politics.

115
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,200
You can still get glimmers of this Lost Cause
memory of the war

116
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,600
And I think the UDC, to a great extent was
— that was their goal.

117
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,540
So the next time someone says the Confederate
monuments are about

118
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,380
just know that that’s exactly what the United
Daughters of the Confederacy wants you to

119
00:06:42,380 --> 00:00:00,000
think.
