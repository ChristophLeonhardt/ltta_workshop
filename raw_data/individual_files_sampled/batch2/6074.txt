so we have a great reporter on the line we always have to talk to them Friends of the show it's Jordan Chariton Jordan can you hear me I can't Jimmy how are you oh there he is look at that it's like it's not Jordan it looks like the clouds have parted and they're coming right at your face live from my poorly lit kitchen no no your little you lit really well so Jordan you just came back from Netroots now people need to know what the net roots are tell people with net roots is yeah networks started over a decade ago has actually started as a yearly Coast's after those progressives at daily coasts it's supposed to be it's billed as the largest progressive conference in the country where thought leaders and politicians come together to basically plot the way forward it was not that which I stated many times there as soon as you got there it kind of seemed like a reincarnation of the Hillary Clinton campaign there if you look at the agenda for all the meetings they were having all the trading sessions it was a lot of how you could resist Trump how you could resist their bad Republican party very little talk about economic issues very little talk about Medicare for all any private prisons free public college and a lot of this talk about artificial things like better local organizing and knowing your values it was like Tom Perez like wrote the schedule you know there were some progressive groups and individuals there but it definitely definitely was troubling if you're interested in the Democratic Party getting its act together everything I saw was a lot of identity politics most of the speakers focused on identity politics very little on economic populism so you submit our values on the ballot that's when we we win or we lead with our values and then we put them in we put hope on the ballot but the question is hope for what I'm against a better values over a girl we need better values so do you want what up how about if I play this little interview you did with someone who was running for the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee and do you want you want me to play that now yeah okay here we go so here's Jordan talking this I wanna know bottom line you know Tom Perez he's talking about share your values which is a bumper sticker that don't mean anything the vod's the bottom line is I believe the polls are showing that whether it's Bernie Sanders or someone of his ilk independence young people a lot of older people too by the way Bernie got a lot of older people are moving towards this populist progressive mode so when you're talking about what the DNC and the Democratic Party message has to be it seems to me it's still focused on well there's realities in governance and we got to get what we can get everyone's talking about this DNC hi I'm talking Democrats okay okay Democrats as a as a whole what needs to happen is it has to go back to local organizing local campaign so if you're if you are running you're winning on a populist you know left or Center message in your community run on that the problem is that people look at the DNC or the Democratic Party as its organized Institute it's not like the Republican Party they're they're organized around three issues guns gays abortion you know that is their issue the Democratic Party is not like that at all you have pro-life democrats you have poll choice numeric rest you have anti-gun democrats you have no portrait you have the multitude of issues there so what we are seeing as a National Party and as a Democratic Party one of the issues that affect your community that's what we're that's when we're at our best government a 50-state strategy worked because it was boiling it down to the local levels what what works for you what resonates in your community cuz I I live in DC now Southeast DC but I'm from college Sparkle just down the street I can tell you what resonates in College Park well well not resonate Anacostia but because that's that's my community I am seeing that what Tom Perez is saying is that you should share your values because your values your community is what you should be running on you should not be running on this national platform because national platforms don't win at the end of the day I disagree and I'll tell you why I had the fortune of going around the country during the campaign and then other things so standing rock Flint East Chicago Alabama a lot of things frankly the Democratic Party isn't talking about and I've spoke probably with thousands of people at this point it's not anecdotal to me the one common theme whether people are a Republican Democrat you know atheists in terms of politics was the economic squeeze and the economic inequality but how you talk about that economic squeeze is different for every community so as a big issue yes economics is an issue but you can't talk about economics in this larger issue without boiling down to the boilerplate why it matters so if you're talking about economics in Southside Chicago they meet more jobs in the XYZ that might be different in Southern California with weather is talking about now the crops are dying because they don't have an unemployment so economics as a whole is an issue but how you talk about has to be different for every community no no I agree with that my point is the people across the board were receptive and frankly angry at wealthy people getting tax cuts great wealthy people getting tax cuts and the oil and the subsidies for the banks and the oil and the bailouts and all that that was across the board so what I say to the Democratic Party is yes you have to shift your message to wherever you are you're not going to be going out in Texas and be like I'm for you no I'm for taxing the wealthy and I'm taking your guns you're not gonna say that but I don't know why the Democratic Party at this point doesn't see the tea leaves that even even Republicans are attracted to the Bernie Sanders message of we're not the days of the bailouts the days of the gravy train the days of the corporate wealth that's just not his message was funny to me is that people act like Bernie Sanders is this new progressive he has been in the Senate for thirty years thirty years saying the same thing I just said what bills has he passed this is a talking point he's got more amendments Bernie Sanders just invented economic equality I am saying he did and what I'm saying is if you go back to 20 2005 cuz I helped with the 50-state strategy that conversation was a part of the teaching without Bernie Sanders and it wasn't about this ultra lap or ultra century there was a conversation we were having locally and it works I'm saying we'd go back to organizing locally so it's not so I am what I'm saying we don't need a democratic Savior so what did what does Bernie Sanders Carla Harris Cory Booker we don't need the apraxia we need many people in the community talking about their values and why their values matter that's what I'm saying we agree on that okay so what basically what it sounded like she was trying as hard as she could to defend what they did in the last election and what they've been doing in the last elections which has gotten them wiped out at every level of government is that what it felt like to you she was doing yes her and many others there and you know I her and I spoke further where I point it out yeah I agree you know if you're going to Montana or North Dakota you might tweak things here and there based on the community but in terms of the economic message we just saw a reality TV star and from what we're seeing now a clearly a fascist win election by crossing party lines on economics and they don't want to cross the law they don't want to be economically populist even though it works with both Democrats and Republicans because that would mean ending the gravy train for the donors that's really what this is about so whether it's a younger party leader like her or some of the older party folk that I spoke with they are resisting but it's not just Trump it is the progressive populist message and that was what that conference was all
