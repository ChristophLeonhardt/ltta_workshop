young turks now has audio the TYT audio network podcast of some of your favorite shows and new shows including one with Nina Turner former Ohio State Senator she's gonna do we the people with Nina Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio Donald Trump's summit with kim jeong-hoon the leader and dictator of north korea has happened and they have signed some sort of agreement although that agreement is vague and we'll get to the terms of that agreement in just a moment but following the meeting Trump did speak to the press and said the following he said that he was suspending joint military exercises with South Korean forces and that he was confident mr. Kim would begin dismantling his nuclear arsenal very quickly now that news caught South Korea by surprise they had no idea that was coming and based on that very statement it appears that the United States has already made a large concession a big concession to South Korea there's also talk of the u.s. I'm sorry to North Korea my apologies a big concession to North Korea and another concession is the idea of bringing US troops who are currently stationed in South Korea home to the United States currently there are about 28,000 American troops in South Korea and that concession could destabilize the region South Korea is very much concerned about that but the only agreement that kim jonghwan made was complete nuclearization which sounds good but there is no talk of a timetable and there is no talk of a verification process to ensure that kim jeong-hoon upholds his side of the deal now we'll get into specifics and more details in just a second but I wanted to get some quick reactions from you guys before we move forward but the only thing new from this is that America has made a huge concession yeah that's not what at all what we expected going I don't think expected going in and I not surprised at all that in the end of it at some will we will continue to have talks to see what North Korea will do that's right that's right so confident they will begin soon possibly maybe maybe not we're going to talk about like what yeah we talked about this yesterday as something that was going to be primarily a photo op and it was really a bunch of pageantry and largely ceremonial so from that standpoint I'm not surprised there no details there really no details that could be possible in a meeting of such brevity and it was really designed just for this moment to see these two leaders shake hands now let's leave aside whether or not this is a good thing but just talk about what what anna is mentioning which is that there is at a left field this concession that we're going to stop these what are perceived as sort of aggressive military maneuvers that threatened in some way on North Korea's safety at least this is the way it's being cast that's not a that's not an unfair way to cast it I would say this overall and believe me we can talk about Kim and we talked about him yesterday and I talked about what a horrible horrible dictator is it's a gulag nation and most of his nation is starving and we can get back into that but just on the point that you're talking about Anna I'm not sure and I think people will have to speak honestly about this have to agree I'm not sure that some small concession even some large concession on our part doesn't help deescalate the tensions there and that's a net gain for the world we've come in this weird way and it's a bizarre perverted way that we've come to this place but having said that if we can get some peace on the Korean Peninsula that'd be good now finally the troops that's a different thing that is absolutely a different because that does ensure security to summit China would love to see us get those troops off of the Korean Peninsula you're absolutely right about that and the reaction from China has been a favorable one they're happy with these talks they're happy with the outcome of these talks and again you know right now we really have no idea how things will proceed because what they signed what Kim jong-un and Donald Trump signed was very skimpy on details nothing new there was really nothing there but again there were large concessions by Donald Trump that go against the interests of our ally South Korea right so let's get into more of those details so Trump's decision to suspend the war games which he described as quote very expensive but also quote very provocative given the continuing negotiations appear to take South Korea by surprise so the military exercises are one thing but what also got them got South Korea a little worried was the idea of pulling US military out of South Korea because that essentially messages to North Korea you know any form of provocation could be met with military action with the United States backing the South Koreans taking the troops out of the country and bringing them back home could really destabilize that situation and also if you look at the terms of this agreement that they signed who acts first is Trump gonna bring the troops back home and then we wait for them to denuclearize and then we lift the sanctions how does that happen how does it get verified now South Korea did respond to this the US and the DPRK I'm sorry this is actually a more of the agreement the US and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula okay how exactly that's just more generic exactly so let's hear from the South Korean a spokesperson on this USFK has received no updated guidance on execution or secession of training exercises to include this fall's a scheduled Ulchi freedom Guardian so in cooperation with our South Korean partners we will continue with our current military posture until we receive updated guidance from the Department of Defense and/or India Pacific Command all right so guess what the Department of Defense also wasn't notified about this unilateral just that Donald Trump made so let's go to their statement the Department of Defense continues to work with the White House the interagency and our allies and partners on a way forward following the summit we will provide additional information as it becomes available but again they were unaware that Trump would offer to bring troops home or end these military exercises all right so with that said let's take a look at what Donald Trump had to say to the press about these so-called war games one of the things that I suggested and I want to do is we're gonna stop the war games flying to South Korea to practice and then drop bombs all over the place and then go back to Guam we are gonna get out of the the war games that cost so much money so under the circumstances that we're negotiating a very comprehensive complete deal I think it's inappropriate to be having war games and I'm doing something that I've wanted to do from the beginning we stopped playing those war games that cost us a fortune the war games are very expensive we pay for a big majority of them we fly in bombers from Guam I know a lot about airplanes it's very expensive because I think number one it's very provocative and I want to do it and I think they're very happy about it because it is so provocative and I think it's a very provocative situation you know I want to do stop the war games I thought they were very provocative but I also think they're very expensive it really is something that I think they very much appreciated and I think it's very provocative especially George since we're getting along so I just want to clarify something in regard to Trump saying that these war games are expensive it just seems a little silly and strange for someone like Trump to make that argument when he himself has advocated and and pushed for a military parade in Washington DC that would cost somewhere between ten to thirty million dollars so if you're really genuinely concerned about how expensive it is maybe don't consider wasting taxpayer money on a military parade parade just so you feel better about yourself and puff up your chest but he is saying the word provide could've over and over again which plays into the narrative that kim jeong-hoon wants to push out there and by the way mind you the concessions are one thing another portion of this is how much this meeting has legitimized Kim Jong Un's place in the world in in the international stage because he's out there in Singapore taking selfies with world leaders gallivanting around town this has really led to a certain level of credibility that North Koreans have been craving and you know I I do agree that it's better that Trump takes this route of diplomacy but he has gone a little too far and that's what I'm concerned about we're now celebrating him yeah the reasoning this thing so that when Trump speaks out of both sides of mouth all the time you know one minute he's for Migration next minute he's not depend on which immigrants were talking about it's worth anything so again with this so when people say how could you guys be against what he's saying you just thought there just to be opposing because it's him or if he says both things we have to now try to determine how he came up to each of those scenarios and the reason he came to this scenario is at the end of that whole compilation was because we're being they're being so nice to me now now we're getting along now they're my friends it's not based on anything it's a reality and if their experts told you anything of what the repercussions of doing previously doing the military exercises we're doing which a lot of people leave nothing except for puffs notches chest which you were a fan of before so now it's just people can easily say hey I like you hey nice hair guy hey we can get along sake won't we and you'll give them anything we want so it's not these concessions this particular ones it's the next ones you'll give because he gave you a piece of cake but there is a caveat that I wanted to quickly mention because remember McCrone from from France was very complimentary to Trump because he understood this is the strategy to use if you want to get third of Trump and if you want him to agree with you on the issues including the Iran nuclear deal for instance which France did not want Trump to pull out of but Trump quickly turned on McCrone and went against what McCrone wanted and I realized something Trump is much more willing to go against our allies and favor our adversaries so that's certainly the case with North Korea with Russia and I think that he for some reason has some sort of affection for those who tend to be dictators those who have a dictatorial streak and he will say the worst things about Justin Trudeau and call him weak and meek but then turn around and say all of these great complementary things about someone like kim jeong-hoon look the outcome of this meeting further alienated our allies now we're a lien aiding South Korea and Japan I mean these are things that we should all consider even though again there is that silver lining of diplomacy rather than insults on Twitter right because it's not just friends we have a very clear set of friends that he is slowly turning into enemies and yes we've seen this happen specifically this week multiple times already it's I guess new friends that everyone else is telling him not to interact with well he does have a thing for strongmen you know it's true I mean Duterte and and air Dhawan and Putin and Kim now and so I could go on it's true and he himself has got sort of strongman tendencies right he'd like to sort of be any any praises Kim for being a tough guy and taking a position of power at a young age and and ruling with a tough hand I mean these are all pretty disgusting things when you look at the details but to a junior saying it's interesting you know if you end up in a good place a place of peace and I know I'm gonna get barked out of the room on this but I'd rather end up at a place of peace for the wrong reasons that is to say just because they get they did they gave him cake and gave them a parade if it if it ends me up in a good place and if it's a net positive in terms of producing peace I'm for it the problem is the details that follow beyond this ceremony I don't know that we're gonna see any follow-through at all Trump got his moment he got his photo-op and he gets to proclaim I brought peace to the Korean Peninsula but as you're gonna detail when you compare this to the agreement that he was not such a fan of like the Iran agreement it leaves us not in the best position the Iran agreement specifically had a process of verification that indicated that they would stop there their nuclear programs we don't have that with North Korea now the argument that you'll hear from some of the supporters of this agreement of the North Korea agreement is that well there will be follow-up meetings to kind of hash out those details and by the way Republicans in Congress to their credit are fighting to have this you know done through through Congress in the form of a treaty so you can really I guess solidify the terms of how this is all going to be done and the reason why I say to their credit is because one of the biggest criticisms that Republicans and Congress had toward Obama and the Iran nuclear deal is that Obama acted unilaterally and they're making the same arguments in regard to Trump and so you don't see that often in politics usually things become tribal and and you'll see people support their side while simultaneously and hypocritically criticizing the other side but in this case Republicans and Congress are saying no no we need to do this through a treaty we need to do this through Congress now another part of their agreement was that the joint statement said that two nations would hold a follow-up or follow-up negotiations led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a high-level North Korean official at the earliest possible date to implement the outcomes of the summit meeting we'll see if that happens but you know as things stand right now I think people are right in being skeptical Pompeyo though I just want to remind everybody Pompeo lit-up Obama over normalizing relations in any way with Cuba he was brutal about it so it's so weird to see these guys all back Trump and somehow support him in a meeting with a dictator who makes the situation in Cuba look like mr. Rogers neighborhood that's right I mean the situation in Cuba the Castro's weren't developing nuclear weapons to cause severe harm they weren't threatening us they weren't threatening our allies you know you might have issues with the way Cuba is is run you might have issues with communism I hear you on that but at the same time they did not pose an imminent threat to the United States they didn't I mean they did decades ago but they certainly don't and the idea that Pompeo would be you know critical of obama and his stance on cuba and then all of a sudden brokering a peace deal it's like these guys all have collective amnesia it's crazy and the issues that one could have should have with Cuba they are we're not they're not on the table right discussing North Korea that's right and by the way let me just say I'd rather they just say well times have changed and I I did have at least acknowledge that you are backpedaling on an original position you can you could even say I may have overstated it for and maybe the politics got the better of me at least that would be honest to what's going on here this your very important issues and I hate you know to use the the word that Ana just used a moment ago to see tribalism dictate what our decision-making process is exactly now just one more video that kind of shows you how much Trump has a played into the narrative that the North Koreans want okay so there was a lot of concern about whether or not Trump would address human rights violations he did not address those violations during this meeting with Kim Jong moon however he did talk about this issue with the press following the summit take a look and you at that point said that North Korea has more brutally oppressed its people than any other regime on earth do you still believe that is the case having having sat down with Kim jong-un it doesn't mean to change that John I believe it's a rough situation over there there's no question about it and we did discuss it today we'll be doing something on it it's it's rough it's rough in a lot of places by the way they didn't really discuss it and when he says it's rough in a lot of places I just I find it fascinating because again it plays into what Kim jong-un wants yes there are human rights violations in other countries there are human rights violations in countries that we do business with including Saudi Arabia however you are making excuses for Kim jong-un or at least minimizing how brutal he is to his own people by making that statement it was the last part of that statement I had a problem with I understand the president's in a tough position right there you're being held to the fire on the issue that you've made an issue that you've acknowledged the human rights issue and what's going on inside the country so you have to waffle it it's one of those situations where as a politician you have to kind of play it generically which he did he said it's a rough situation over there that was his way of saying I still believe it's pretty brutal but then the last thing he said was but you know it's brutal in a lot of places all over the world yes that completely normalizes it or takes it to a place where it suggests anyway that it's more commonplace than just in North Korea whereas we know North can really really the head of the table when it comes to this kind of brutality absolutely two easy ways for the young turks one is hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos
