SO. LELAND: MOLLY HENNEBERG WITH THAT DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU GOOD LIVES. FOR MORE INSIGHT, LET'S HAVE A STAFF WRITER WITH THE "WASHTINGTON EXAMINER." THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. RIGHT OFF THE TALK ON THE DETAILS OF THE NEGOTIATION FOR THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY MAY NOT BE SOMETHING WHOLLY NEW. AM I RIGHT? THE DRAMA OVER SCHEDULING THE SUMMIT IS NEW, BUT THE DETAILS NECESSARILY AREN'T. WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE IN THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION PUSHED FOR AN AGREEMENT WITH THE NORTH KOREANS EARLY ON IN THE 90s ONLY TO HAVE KIM JONG UN FATHER CHEAT ON THE AGREEMENT ENRICHED URANIUM ON THE SIDE OF EVERYTHING FALL APART. THE UNITED STATES CUT OFF THE OIL SUPPLY AND WE WERE BACK TO SQUARE ONE. I THINK THAT SORT OF REMEMBRANCE IS WHAT INSPIRED THE CAUTION WE ARE HEARING FROM. GENERAL MATTIS SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE A BUMPY RIDE. ELIZABETH: SO WHAT IS NEW ASIDE FROM DETAILS OF THE MEETING. HIS ENRICHED URANIUM AND NOW WE HAVE SOME NEW I GUESS YOU COULD SAY FACTORS IN NEGOTIATIONS. COMMEMORATIVE COINS AND ENVELOPES ASIDE, THERE ARE TWO FACTORS. NORTH KOREA HAS 16 NUCLEAR MISSILES RIGHT NOW. THE REAL DIFFERENCES YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS UNCONVENTIONAL IN HIS APPROACH TO NEGOTIATIONS. DECADES USING NEW FACT OR HERE AND I THINK HE'S MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITH GETTING IN A RATIONAL ACTOR TO ACT SOMEWHAT RATIONALLY AND COME TO THE TABLE. BUT THERE IS A RISK LIKE MITCH McCONNELL WARNED THAT YOU MIGHT FALL IN LOVE WITH THE DEAL TOO MUCH THAT YOU DON'T FOCUS ON THE DETAILS AND IN THE END YOU RISK. TO GO THE PRESIDENT IS BEING CAUTIOUS? AT ONE POINT HE DID SAY ON FRIDAY WHERE HE SAID LISTEN, THIS IS A PROCESS. WE TALK ABOUT THE MEETING BUT IT COULD BE ONE OF MANY MEETINGS. YOU SUSPECT THAT IS THE CASE AFTER JUNE 12? CLEARLY THIS IS GOING TO BE A PROCESS BECAUSE THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE ONE DEFINITION DENUCLEARIZATION AND WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT DEFINITION AND QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO ENFORCE AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY DON'T ACHIEVE THE SECOND TIME AROUND. THERE WILL BE A PROCESS, THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CONFLICTING APPROACHES FROM THE PRESIDENT. HE GETS TOUGH ON NORTH KOREA AND THEN KIM JONG UN NUMBER TWO IN THE OVAL OFFICE. IT'S GOING TO BE A PROCESS LIKE YOU SAID. AT THIS POINT WE HAVE TO BUCKLE UP AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. ELIZABETH: SECRETARY MATTIS AS YOU MENTIONED IN SINGAPORE AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE GAP IN EXPECTATIONS. WE SEE THE GAP GETS SMALLER AND SMALLER OVER THE NEXT NINE DAYS. WE ALL KIND OF TALKED ABOUT THAT IN THE LETTER THAT WAS GIVEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. THAT'S A PERFECT ENCAPSULATION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MORE THAN HAPPY AND THEN THE SECRET SERVICE SWOOPS IN AND SAYS WE NEED TO CHECK TO MAKE CERTAIN THERE IS NOTHING POISONOUS OR WRONG WITH THEM. THAT KIND OF SHOWS YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT HERE WHO WANTS TO BE PERSONAL, CHARMING AND CHARISMATIC AND GET THE DEAL DONE. BUT THEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE SEEN THIS PLAY OUT BEFORE. IT IS UP IN THE AIR, THE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS BRINGING SOMETHING NEW AND PERHAPS THAT'S NEEDED. ELIZABETH: WHAT ARE YOUR PREDICTIONS AFTER COVERING THE WHITE HOUSE AND WHAT HE THINKS GOING TO HAPPEN? THE ONLY THING YOU CAN SAY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IS EVERYTHING SO UNPREDICTABLE. THE ONE THING WE DID SAY IS THE WILLINGNESS TO WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE. HE GOT KIM JONG UN TO SHOW SOME CONFESSION TO ASK MORE POLITELY IF YOU WILL. I THINK WE COULD SEE AN INITIAL AGREEMENT, BUT IT'S MUCH LONGER IN THE FOLLOW-THROUGH. AND ALSO LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE IRAN DEAL.
