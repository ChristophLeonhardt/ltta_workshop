- Yeah, ooh, this make
my teeth look white.
Oh!
My teeth are not that white, girl.
Okay.
Hey YouTube world, it's me, Evelyn.
Just wanted to pop in, you know.
I just want to share with
you my experience recently,
speaking at a university.
I am from the internets, as you know,
and one of my goals in 2018,
although I haven't made
a 2018 goals video,
you know on this channel
I post my yearly goals
and I've done that for
the past couple years,
I didn't do that this year.
Cause my only goal was to quit
my job girl,and I did that.
In the spring, I had been
invited to, and paid,
Compensated!
My god!
To speak on a panel
during South by Southwest,
and it was such a dope experience.
After that experience, I
posted on Instagram like,
"Hey I wanna get into public speaking."
I have things I wanna
share with the world.
I have words that I would like to say.
And I do think that I
am one of those people
from the internets who
is also good in person
because that's not always the case,
you know what I'm saying?
That's not always the case.
And I enjoy doing so, I
enjoy being on a stage.
What?
I tell people about it,
not necessarily asking for help,
but just letting it be
known that this is a thing
that I'm going for, you
know what I'm saying?
On some Oprah super soul
Sunday, you feel me?
You let your intentions
be known, and the universe
do its thing supposedly.
So shout out to Jouelz
y, she put me in touch
with a speaking agency and she was like
"Take it from here", you
know what I'm saying.
And she's a very good resource person?
I'm not very good at knowing
how, and who to ask for help.
How to connect those dots.
And Jouelzy is just a master connector.
Of being like bleep bloop
bloop bloop bloop bloop.
I feel like I need to say
that cause in this industry,
whether you consider it Hollywood,
whether you consider it communications,
in journalism--my original background,
everything is reference based.
What is a resume, sis?
It's this person referring you to this ...
It's word of mouth.
So I really appreciate Jouelzy
putting me on in that way.
And shout out to myself,
for not just letting that
resource die, you know?
A lot of the times
people give us something
to try and help us out
and we just let it slip
beneath our fingers
but I didn't, you know.
I contacted them, I was like listen,
"We finna do this?"
And they're like, "We can do this."
And I was like, "Okay!"
So that leads us to a couple days ago,
this is very recent we're
at the end of the year,
you know what I'm saying,
it's been a journey.
(laughs)
But I just got back
recently from Gambier, Ohio,
where I was invited to speak to BSU,
the Black Student Union at Kenyon College.
So I'm gonna toss in a cute little vlog.
I vlogged it.
(r&b music)
(r&b music)
(airplane seatbelt ding)
(r&b music)
So we out here,
(laughing)
She gotta keep her eyes on the road!
-  I gotta make sure we live.
- Michaela picked me up from the airport.
We are in Columbus, Ohio, but
that's not where we're going.
-  Nope.
- Where we goin?
- Gambier, Ohio.
- Gambier, Ohio is technically a village.
-  Mhm.
And, she said she gon' let me know
when it look like we're
driving through Klan country.
(laughing)
But you know what?
Anything to reach my
people, the youths, okay?
(laughing)
-  That was a trash shot
-  Dead
-  But ya know, still I rise.
-  I was about to say,
you might be able to catch
somethin' else later.
-  So we have survived
the Jeepers Creepers part of the trip.
- Yes, we've made it through.
-  But you know,
have we made it to safety?
Listen.
-  It is, very rural.
- We out here in the woods.
So like I have heard
people say "in the styx"
-  This is the styx.
- Styx.
-  Styx.
- Wow
-  There used to be
leaves, now it's just sticks.
- Now it's just sticks (laughter)
(r&b music)
-  Leaves.
(laughter)
(crunching leaves)
-  They not
on the trees anymore.
-  We ain't got leaves.
-  Y'all ain't
got leaves in Austin?
-  We ain't got leaves like this.
-  Wow you are
- Hold up, she say, the president,
- (laughing) Our president is black
- Is black?
- That's what he is
- Wow
We're on the set of Gilmore
Girls, as you cans see,
Kenyon College, Gambier Ohio.
(R&B music)
So I have about
an hour,
to shower, get ready.
Of course we are wearing,
magical black girl.
Let's talk toiletries,
castile soap,
to warsh my body.
Y'all seen them Dexter's Lab memes.
That was like "Oh my god, I
love your southern accent.
"Say it again.
"Warsh rag" (laughing)
I got this hand cream,
that I'm going to use
as lotion, on my body.
Deodorant...
Gonna brush my teeth, y'all
know what toothpaste look like.
Body butter, Black Girl Beauty brand.
Ay Bay Bay!
And a bunch of other stuff
that I don't feel like
going through right now.
Because I am not a beauty guru, yet.
Okay?
Let's hop in the shower.
(r&b music)
- Now tonight, on this Monday night,
I know it's cold, so I appreciate it.
But we're so excited and grateful to have
Evelyn from the Internets here tonight.
She came all the way from Texas,
where apparently they don't have leaves.
(laughter)
(r&b music)
- Hey!
- So I'm back,
at the hotel.
I did it, I spoke, I spoke.
I did the thing.
About my two pieces of advice that will
help you go very far in your
life, especially as a creative.
And then Q & A,
super cute.
I thought it went well,
it was very informal, very casual.
I'm going to wash,
warsh, I'm gonna warsh my face
(laugh) and pack up, I just
brought a backpack sis.
Then I'm going to edit,
because I have a deadline
coming up.
Boop.
I totally didn't edit last night.
So, there's that.
(sigh)
(laugh)
Good morning, I wanted to, before I left,
I wanted to step outside
and show you Kenyon College.
-  Leaves! (laughing)
This is the College Relations Center.
Wow,
it's a house,
wow.
These
are all school buildings.
(r&b music)
Ooh! Ooh! Oop!
So that was my little vlog,
my little speaking gig vlog (laugh)
Shout out to the students
at Kenyon College,
the Black Student Union,
thank you so much for inviting me out.
It's wild to see all the different
types of college experiences there are,
and how we still manage to
connect with each other.
I went to the University of Texas.
50,000 students, they have
less than 2,000 students.
My high school was bigger
than their whole college.
We are everywhere!
Amen?
I just wanted to come on,
and share that experience,
accomplishment.
If you would like me
to come to your school,
I am...
More than likely down.
I would like that.
I will put all that information
in the video description
box. I can talk about: Women
in Media, Black people in
Media. You know what I am saying?
Wakanda forever.
We can figure something out girl.
Storytelling,
Finding your Voice,
Working in Social Media.
And you know, you don't
have to be - you feel me?
a Magical Black Girl
to value this Magical Black Girl!
Amen?
Whoever you are,
information will be in the
video description box, and
hopefully we can connect.
Thank you for watching my videos,
and making it possible for anyone to
care to throw me on a panel,
or to give me the opportunity to speak.
Thanks so much for continuing to watch,
I feel hella old sometimes,
but you know, we out here
glistening.
Okay?
I will definitely see you
on the internet, somewhere.
But, hopefully I will see
you off the internet too.
Bye
