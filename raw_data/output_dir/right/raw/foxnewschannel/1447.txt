1
00:00:00,569 --> 00:00:02,270
AT CONCLUSION THIS HOUR WE'LL

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,840
SING HIS STANDARD, GOD BLESS THE

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,307
USA.

4
00:00:05,307 --> 00:00:07,242
BRIAN: THAT IS STAR POWER THERE.

5
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:09,978
WE HAVE STAR POWER HERE.

6
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:13,248
ON SCREEN LEFT, GERALDO RIVERA,

7
00:00:13,248 --> 00:00:14,649
165 POUNDS OF PURE FURRY.

8
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:20,489
TO MY IMMEDIATE LEFT --

9
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:20,889
STEVE: 155.

10
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:24,760
BRIAN: HOW MUCH DO YOU WEIGH?

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,460
>> 155.

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,464
BRIAN: COREY LEWANDOSKI, THE

13
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:32,134
COAUTHOR OF TRUMP V TRUMP, WHO

14
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:33,869
DID ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING.

15
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:35,570
>> HE HAS ALL THE SOURCES.

16
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,438
MUCH BETTER LOOKING.

17
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:38,540
>> ONLY ONE SAID TRUMP WAS GOING

18
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,408
TO WIN.

19
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:41,109
YOU SAID IT WOULD BE SOME

20
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,811
OBSCURE DELEGATE IN MAINE WOULD

21
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,212
PUT HIM OVER THE TOP.

22
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:47,949
>> WE WON THAT DELEGATE.

23
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:49,651
AINSLEY: YES MORNING WE WERE ALL

24
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:50,352
STILL AT FOX.

25
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:52,054
IT WAS RIGHT AFTER OUR SHOW AND

26
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:53,922
THE LETTER WAS RELEASED, THE

27
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:55,323
PRESIDENT SAYING I'M CANCELING

28
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:56,825
THIS MEETING WITH NORTH KOREA.

29
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:58,393
WHY DO YOU THINK HE DID THAT.

30
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:00,729
>> LOOK, THIS PRESIDENT IS A

31
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:01,863
DEAL-MAKER AND WE KNOW THAT WHAT

32
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:03,265
WE'VE SEEN FROM HIM THE FIRST

33
00:01:03,265 --> 00:01:05,700
PRESIDENT IN OUR LIFETIME

34
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,569
BASICALLY, 30 YEARS OF AMERICAN

35
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,571
FOREIGN POLICY, WILLING TO

36
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:11,706
ENGAGE NORTH KOREA TO

37
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:13,075
DENUCLEARIZE THE PENINSULA.

38
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:14,810
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP

39
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,278
BECAUSE ADMINISTRATION AFTER

40
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:18,080
ADMINISTRATION PRIOR TO HIM HAS

41
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,248
NOT BEEN WILLING DO TO THAT.

42
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:25,053
IF CREE WILL NOT ACT IN GOOD

43
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:26,621
FAITH WE'LL JUST NOT GO THERE.

44
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:27,622
PRESIDENT SAID WE'RE WILLING TO

45
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:29,491
DO THIS, BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST

46
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:30,892
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SOME

47
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:32,627
CONCESSIONS AND THOSE

48
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:34,563
CONCESSIONS ARE TO DENUCLEARIZE.

49
00:01:34,563 --> 00:01:36,031
THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP.

50
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:37,833
BRIAN: WHEN WAS IT CLEAR THIS

51
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,268
WASN'T HAPPENING AND HOW

52
00:01:40,402 --> 00:01:41,570
SAY I'M OUT BEFORE THEY'RE OUT?

53
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,004
>> I THINK THAT IS SIGNIFICANT

54
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:46,074
BUT TO ME THE WRITING WAS ON THE

55
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:48,110
WALL WHEN THE KOREAN AND

56
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,212
NORTH KOREAN ADVANCE TEAM NEVER

57
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:54,082
SHOWED UP IN SINGAPORE WITH OUR

58
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:55,183
LOGISTICAL PEOPLE.

59
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:56,184
SEEMED CLEAR THEY WERE SETTING

60
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:58,787
THE PRESIDENT UP TO EMBARASS

61
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:00,188
HIM, TO HAVE KIM NOT SHOW WITH

62
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:01,623
THE PRESIDENT IN SINGAPORE,

63
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,592
WOULD HAVE BEEN REAL

64
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:04,593
EMBARASSMENT TO THE UNITED

65
00:02:04,593 --> 00:02:06,595
STATES AND A BLOW TO OUR FOREIGN

66
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:07,429
POLICY.

67
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:10,065
I AGREE 100% WITH CORY, THIS

68
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:11,700
PRESIDENT IS TRULY ENGAGED IN

69
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,302
TAKING ON THE MOST INTRACTABLE

70
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,804
PROBLEM WE FACE, THE MOST

71
00:02:15,804 --> 00:02:16,671
DANGEROUS THING IN THE WORLD

72
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:19,074
TODAY, IS THE NORTH KOREAN

73
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:21,076
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY AND HE KNOWS

74
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:21,343
IT.

75
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:22,110
KIM KNOWS IT.

76
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,045
THE PRESIDENT KNOWS IT.

77
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:24,913
KIM NEEDS US.

78
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:26,781
I THINK EVENTUALLY WE WILL GET

79
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:28,316
SOME KIND OF DEAL BUT I THINK

80
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:29,484
THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT AT THIS

81
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,186
TIME TO CANCEL THE DEAL.

82
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:32,454
STEVE: AS YOU KNOW IN THE

83
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:34,089
BEGINNING WHEN THE SURPRISE DEAL

84
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:35,857
WAS STRUCK THERE WOULD BE A

85
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:36,424
SUMMIT.

86
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:37,893
MAINSTREAM MEDIA SAID, YOU KNOW,

87
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:39,427
THIS PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO GET

88
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:42,731
US INTO A NUCLEAR WAR, TALKING

89
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:44,132
ABOUT LITTLE "ROCKET MAN."

90
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:45,534
NOW HE CAN'T MAKE A DEAL.

91
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:46,701
NOW THE PRESIDENT SAID I'M

92
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:48,236
GETTING PLAYED, I'M OUT,

93
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:49,971
DEMOCRATS AND SOME OF THEIR

94
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:52,073
FRIENDS IN THE MEDIA, SUMMARIZED

95
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:56,344
WHAT HAPPENED THIS WAY.

96
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,513
>> THERE GOES THAT NOBEL PEACE

97
00:02:58,513 --> 00:02:59,481
PRIZE.

98
00:02:59,481 --> 00:02:59,848
[LAUGHTER]

99
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:02,017
>> SOUNDS LIKE A 13-YEAR-OLD

100
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:03,752
STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN

101
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:04,920
BREAKUP LETTER FROM OVERNIGHT

102
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,453
CAMP.

103
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:07,722
>> THE ART OF DIPLOMACY IS A LOT

104
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:09,424
HARDER THAN "THE ART OF THE

105
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:09,724
DEAL."

106
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,126
>> HE GOT TO LETTER FROM THE

107
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:12,694
PRESIDENT SAYING OKAY, NEVER

108
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:17,832
MIND, HE MUST BE HAVING A GIGGLE

109
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:20,302
FIT RIGHT NOW IN NORTH KOREA.

110
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:21,970
>> PRESIDENT WAS REHEARSING END

111
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,372
ZONE DAMAGES AND WE WEREN'T AT

112
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,073
THE 50-YARD LINE.

113
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:26,374
>> THIS IS BREAKUP LETTER.

114
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,476
WHEN YOUR RELATIONSHIP STARTS

115
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,045
SOURING YOU WANT TO BE ONE BREAK

116
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:32,080
UP FIRST, YOU CUT IT OFF.

117
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,315
WE LEAVE IT OPEN.

118
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:35,483
THAT IS WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE.

119
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,018
STEVE: JUST LIKE THAT.

120
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:38,453
COREY, AFTER THE PRESIDENT

121
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:40,021
PULLED THE PLAYING, THEY DIDN'T

122
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:42,591
THINK HE WAS GOING TO DO THAT.

123
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:43,592
WE'RE AVAILABLE ANYTIME.

124
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:45,527
>> MAXIMUM HARM CAMPAIGN THAT

125
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:46,861
THE UNITED STATES PUT ON

126
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:47,696
NORTH KOREA, THE ECONOMIC

127
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:49,264
SANCTIONS ARE PUTTING A

128
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:50,665
STRANGLEHOLD ON THAT ECONOMY,

129
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,367
THEY KNOW THEY CAN NOT SURVIVE.

130
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:53,668
THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE THIS WITH

131
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,637
THE HELP OF CHINA AND THE HELP

132
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:57,672
OF OTHER WORLD LEADERS, TO SAY

133
00:03:57,672 --> 00:04:00,609
WE HAVE TO DENUCLEARIZE THAT

134
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:00,976
PENINSULA.

135
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:02,177
IT IS TOO DANGEROUS.

136
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:03,912
WE CAN'T ALLOW KIM JONG-UN TO

137
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:05,213
HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND

138
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:07,315
CONTINUE TO PROMULGATE, BY THE

139
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,617
WAY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION

140
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:12,153
TRIED TO GET THIS DONE, AND WE

141
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:12,520
COULDN'T.

142
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,989
WE SENT BOATLOADS OF LITERAL

143
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:16,257
CASH TO NORTH KOREA TO GET THEM

144
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:21,262
TO STOP THE NUCLEARIZATION

145
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,964
PROGRAM AND THEY DIDN'T.

146
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:24,833
WE'LL HAVE IT UNDER OUR TERMS.

147
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,701
BRIAN: THE MEETING IN CHINA AND

148
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:27,936
THAT MEETING IN THE CITY THAT

149
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:30,972
CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, THAT

150
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:33,942
CHANGED THE -- THE PRESIDENT

151
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:35,644
BELIEVE CHINA DID THIS, THEY

152
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:37,345
TOLD HIM TO BACK OFF, SLOW DOWN,

153
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,481
IF CHINA IS PULLING THE STRINGS,

154
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:41,883
HOW DO YOU REACT, GERALDO?

155
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:43,418
>> NO DOUBT CHINA IS THE AGENT

156
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,587
THAT ENCOURAGED KIM TO SABOTAGE

157
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:46,288
THIS MEETING.

158
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:49,257
IT WAS ONLY AFTER KIM, WHO ONLY

159
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:50,925
TRAVELED ABROAD TWICE, BOTH

160
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:53,528
TIMES TO CHINA, ONLY AFTER HIS

161
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:55,230
MEETING, THE SECOND MEETING IN

162
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,265
CHINA EVERYTHING STARTED TO GO

163
00:04:57,265 --> 00:04:57,565
SOUR.

164
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:59,067
I DO BELIEVE THE CHINESE ARE

165
00:04:59,067 --> 00:04:59,701
DOUBLE DEALING.

166
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:01,269
PEOPLE HAVE TO RECALL, IF YOU

167
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:02,937
ARE MY AGE YOU REMEMBER THE

168
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:05,774
KOREAN WAR, WE HAD THE KOREAN

169
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:07,642
WAR WON AGAINST THE NORTH KOREAN

170
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,477
ARMY UNTIL THE CHINESE

171
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,913
INTERVENED MASSIVELY WITH THEIR

172
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:12,213
ARMY.

173
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:13,682
THE KOREAN WAR WAS NOT JUST THE

174
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:15,150
UNITED STATES AND ALLIES AND

175
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,418
UNITED NATIONS AGAINST

176
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:17,752
NORTH KOREA, WE WERE BASICALLY

177
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:18,720
FIGHTING CHINA.

178
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,855
CHINA STILL SEEMS TO ME PANICKED

179
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:22,557
THAT TRUMP OPENED UP THIS

180
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:25,260
POSSIBILITY OF A DENUCLEARIZED

181
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,660
NORTH KOREA.

182
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,828
THEY PANICKED.

183
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,963
THEY WANT TO IRRITANT IN THE

184
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:30,665
EYES OF THE WEST AND UNITED

185
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:31,833
STATES PARTICULARLY.

186
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:36,471
THEY WANT NORTH KOREA TO THE

187
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:38,206
ROGUE STATE SO THAT CHINA

188
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:41,376
APPEARS ONE REINS THEM IN.

189
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,745
I BELIEVE THE CHINESE PANICKED

190
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:45,880
WITH THE TIMING OF THIS MEETING

191
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,615
SABOTAGED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

192
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,184
ENCOURAGED KIM TO PLAY THE

193
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:49,718
DOUBLE GAME.

194
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:50,285
STEVE: ALL RIGHT.

195
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:52,420
>> WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU BOTH

196
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,390
ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND MS-13.

197
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,558
THE PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT

198
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:57,659
THIS SO MUCH.

199
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,127
BRIAN GOT THAT EXCLUSIVE

200
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:00,695
INTERVIEW WITH HIM.

201
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:03,631
A MS-13 GANG MEMBER IS ACCUSED

202
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,500
OF KILLING AND BURNING THIS MAN.

203
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,369
HE CAME INTO OUR COUNTRY AS

204
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:08,503
UNACCOMPANIED MINOR.

205
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:10,038
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

206
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:11,773
>> HE IS AN MALL.

207
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:12,907
THESE GANG MEMBERS HAVE NO

208
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:13,241
RIGHTS.

209
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:15,110
THE RICO STATUTES OR ANY OTHER

210
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,344
LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITY THAT

211
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:17,445
WE HAVE WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT

212
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:20,315
OF HOMELAND SECURITY, LOCAL LAW

213
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:21,015
ENFORCEMENT, OUR STATE POLICE

214
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:23,017
HAVE TO CRACK DOWN ON WHAT

215
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:23,585
THEY'RE DOING.

216
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:25,854
AND LOOK, THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED

217
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:27,389
SUCH GRIEF FROM THE MAINSTREAM

218
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,424
MEDIA FOR CALLING THESE PEOPLE

219
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:30,792
OUT FOR THE TERMS THEY USE,

220
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,160
THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO RESPECT FOR

221
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,528
THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE.

222
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:35,630
WE'VE SEEN IT TIME AND TIME AND

223
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,798
TIME AGAIN AND THIS PRESIDENT

224
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:38,133
THROUGH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND

225
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,367
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF

226
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:41,469
JUSTICE HAS CRACKED DOWN ON

227
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:41,770
MS-13.

228
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,338
HE WAS OUT IN BETHPAGE JUST THE

229
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:44,739
OTHER DAY TALKING ABOUT THIS.

230
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,908
THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO BUT THE

231
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:48,176
FIRST PRESIDENT TO ACTUALLY TAKE

232
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:50,578
THIS ON AS A CAUSE TO MAKE OUR

233
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,147
COUNTRY SAFER.

234
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:53,481
STEVE: GERALDO, THE PRESIDENT

235
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,250
TOOK HEAT LAST WEEK HE WAS ASKED

236
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,118
A QUESTION BY A SHERIFF ABOUT

237
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:59,554
MS-13, HE CALLED THEM ANIMALS.

238
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:01,389
PEOPLE ARE GOING HE IS CALLING

239
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:02,424
ALL CRIMINALS ANIMALS.

240
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:04,259
THAT WAS WRONG, TAKEN OUT OF

241
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:04,592
CONTEXT.

242
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,661
>> I AGREE PRESIDENT WAS TAKEN

243
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:07,695
OUT OF CONTEXT.

244
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:09,497
I ONLY HEARD THE COMMENTS WHAT

245
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:10,098
THE PRESIDENT SAID.

246
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:11,499
I RESPONDED TO THE COMMENTS

247
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,768
ABOUT THE ANIMAL, I WAS AFRAID

248
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:15,770
HE WAS DEMONIZING ENTIRE CLASS

249
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,739
OF UNACCOMPANIED MINORS AND

250
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:18,573
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.

251
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:21,009
HE WAS NOT AND I CLARIFIED MY

252
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:21,342
REMARKS.

253
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:22,310
SPECIFICALLY TO WHAT AINSLEY

254
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,145
ASKED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR

255
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:28,183
PERSON, WHAT I FEAR IS THAT HE

256
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:30,018
CAME AS UNACCOMPANIED MINOR,

257
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:33,588
GREW UP TO BE A GANGBANGER.

258
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:35,256
I HEAR PEOPLE MAKING ARGUMENT.

259
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,958
THAT IS WHY YOU CAN'T HAVE

260
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,593
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS, YOU CAN'T

261
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:40,161
CUT THEM ANY SLACK WHEN THEY

262
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:41,930
CROSS THE BORDER.

263
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,199
I URGE PEOPLE NOT TO THINK -- I

264
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,066
REMEMBER IN THE MIDDLE EAST

265
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,367
YOUNG PALESTINIANSIANS WERE

266
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,470
BEING KILLED, MOSTLY

267
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,171
INADVERTENTLY THE JUSTIFICATION

268
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:51,739
THEY WILL GROW UP TO BE

269
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:52,140
TERRORISTS.

270
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,308
THAT IS NOT THE WAY AMERICANS

271
00:07:53,308 --> 00:07:53,608
THINK.

272
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:55,710
THE FACT THAT THIS ONE CHILD

273
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,580
GREW UP TO BE AN ANIMAL TO USE

274
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,981
COREY'S WORD, ACCORDING TO THE

275
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,416
PRESIDENT DOES NOT MEAN THAT

276
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,384
THESE CHILDREN COMING IN DON'T

277
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,820
DESERVE THE SAME COMPASSION AS

278
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,389
ANY OTHER REFUGEE, INNOCENT,

279
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:08,790
VULNERABLE.

280
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,360
IT IS OUR JOB TO HELP CRAFT OUR

281
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,528
SOCIETY TO KEEP THEM --

282
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:15,096
STEVE: YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF

283
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:18,199
PEOPLE FROM MS-13 USE THAT

284
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,935
PARTICULAR LOOPHOLE IN OUR LAWS

285
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,036
TO GET INTO THE UNITED STATES.

286
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:24,572
>> I KNOW THAT MS-13 IS

287
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,140
MOTIVATED TO TRY TO CORRUPT

288
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,576
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, INTO

289
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:29,544
BECOMING CRIMINALS AND --

290
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:31,112
STEVE: SOME OF THEM ARE

291
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:36,784
CRIMINALS IN EL SALAVADOR.

292
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,152
>> WHEN YOU'RE 8-YEAR-OLD,

293
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:39,120
YOU'RE NOT A CRIMINAL.

294
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,755
I WANT A MEASURED, COMPREHENSIVE

295
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:41,990
APPROACH TO IMMIGRATION.

296
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,625
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD

297
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,659
GET HIS WALL.

298
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,928
I URGE THE PRESIDENT TO SIMPLIFY

299
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:49,464
THIS DEBATE, GET THE DREAM ACT

300
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:52,534
KIDS, GIVE THEM THEIR ROUTE TO

301
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:53,268
CITIZENSHIP EVENTUALLY AND GET

302
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:55,169
THE WALL BEING FUNDED

303
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:55,570
$25 BILLION.

304
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,373
I THINK WE CAN MAKE THAT DEAL.

305
00:08:58,373 --> 00:08:58,606
>>

306
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,141
BRIAN: LASTLY MITCH McCONNELL

307
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:01,309
SAID THERE WILL BE NOTHING DONE

308
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:02,410
BEFORE NOVEMBER.

309
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,912
WHO BENEFITS HAVING NOTHING DONE

310
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,413
FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS.

311
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:06,981
>> ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, PEOPLE

312
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,751
COMING INTO THE COUNTRY

313
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:10,118
ILLEGALLY.

314
00:09:10,118 --> 00:09:11,119
WE ARE A SOVEREIGN NATION.

315
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,654
WE HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE A WALL

316
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:12,921
UP.

317
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:14,389
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW CONGRESS

318
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:15,623
DOESN'T FUND THIS.

319
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:16,925
IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THEY

320
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:18,893
WERE FUNDING A BORDER FENCE.

321
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,763
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS MEMBER

322
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:23,331
OF THE UNITED STATES USED MONEY

323
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:24,899
FOR FUNDING THE BORDER FENCE

324
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:25,767
BECAUSE OF SECURITY CONCERNS.

325
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,335
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE CONTROL

326
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:28,603
OUR BORDERS.

327
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:30,705
WE NEED A BETTER IMMIGRATION

328
00:09:30,705 --> 00:09:31,039
SYSTEM.

329
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,974
GET RID OF THE LOTTERY PROGRAM.

330
00:09:32,974 --> 00:09:34,442
GET RID OF SANCTUARY CITY.

331
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:36,544
IT IS COMPREHENSIVE --

332
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:37,545
BRIAN: NO ONE IS DOING IT.

333
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:39,681
>> LOOK, THERE HAS TO BE ENOUGH

334
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:41,549
POLITICAL WILL OR ACCOUNTABLE AT

335
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:43,251
THE BALLOT BOX TO MAKE SURE THAT

336
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:45,119
THE FIRST AND FOREMOST THING WE

337
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:48,222
DO AS A COUNTRY PROTECT OUR

338
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:50,325
CITIES FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN

339
00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:51,659
DOMESTIC, STOPPING PEOPLE WHO

340
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,361
COME INTO THE COUNTRY TO KILL

341
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:53,628
IT.

342
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:55,063
>> WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE OUR

343
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:56,164
LANGUAGE IS MEASURED.

344
00:09:56,164 --> 00:09:58,333
THAT WE DON'T DENY THAT EVERY

345
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,603
SURVEY, EVERY RESEARCH, EVERY

346
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:03,571
POLL TAKEN SHOWS THIS

347
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:04,606
POPULATION, UNFORTUNATE THEY'RE

348
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:05,974
HERE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES

349
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:07,842
ALL THE REST, MAYBE MANY OF THEM

350
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:10,111
SHOULD BE DEPORTED, BUT THE VAST

351
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,113
MAJORITY OF THEM ARE

352
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:13,114
LAW-ABIDING, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE

353
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:15,950
WHO ARE ONLY SEEKING THE

354
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,784
AMERICAN DREAM.

355
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:19,220
WE CAN'T FORGET THAT.

356
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,922
>> GERALDO SAID WE'LL TAKE

357
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:21,923
PEOPLE HERE THROUGH NO FAULT OF

358
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:22,624
THEIR OWN.

359
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,359
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO PLAY

360
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,760
POLITICS WITH THEM.

361
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,062
STEVE: ULTIMATELY GUY, CONGRESS

362
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,864
MAY HAVE TO STEP IN TO CHANGE

363
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:30,231
THE LAW.

364
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:32,567
BRIAN: CONGRESS HAS TO STEP UP.

365
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,135
STEVE: GREAT, SPIRITED DEBATE.

366
00:10:34,135 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
