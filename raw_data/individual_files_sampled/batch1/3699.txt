hundreds of malls have closed over the last several years because people's shopping habits to change there was a time in the US when there was a spending frenzy of consumerism and everyone was shopping and shopping malls were where everybody spent their time and went on the weekend you know we would go to the Auntie Anne's Pretzels stand and we would go to Abercrombie and we would walk around the mall and hang out there for hours then the recession hit and not only did the spending slowdown but people's values change people are now spending more on experiences over things especially the apparel industry has been hit especially hard another big factor that I always consider when we're talking about malls is the rise of Technology when you go online to Amazon you could read thousands of reviews from people who have had this product tried it out maybe had issues with it maybe it's been using it for a year and say it's great and that's so much more credible as a consumer than what a retail worker is going to tell you that's just how it is it's also more convenient when we talk about e-commerce that's definitely a huge threat to retailers that have large store bases but it still accounts for only about 8% of total retail sales I think that one of the biggest threats to traditional retailers today is just changing shopping habits it's people really want deep deep discounts they're going to places like t.j.maxx they're going to Amazon and they're shopping for clothes at Amazon this is something that people didn't go to Amazon for a couple years ago everybody just wants the cheapest price but also wants the highest quality product so what's happening is a lot of stores particularly department stores like Speers Macy's K Mart's are closing and what that does to a mall is a the mall loses its biggest tenants the tenants that's paying the most in rent the most in providing them all the money to keep the lights on and it also severely decreases foot traffic to the mall since most people go to the mall to go to these big what they're called anchor stores so in malls close it just aren't that valuable it's a lot of space and it kind of something that no new mall operator wants to take on so you basically have this huge deserted area there's nothing going on there it's very spooky so a lot of models are thinking about more like experiential attractions that will bring people in movie theaters things like that large restaurants so I think a lot of malls are betting on that to pull more customers in the whole retail landscape is transforming and malls are no longer really at the center of it
