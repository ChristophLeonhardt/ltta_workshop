TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA.
GRIFF.
>> JOHN, IT'S THE SOUND OF
CHAIN SAUCE AND BULLDOZERS HERE
IN TALLAHASSEE.
THIS IS JUST ONE OF DOZENS OF
STREETS WITH THIS TREE CLEARING
GOING ON.
LOOK AT THIS.
SUCH AN UNBELIEVABLE TASK AT
HAND.
YOU HAVE IN THIS CASE THIS
BULLDOZER TRYING TO GET THIS
TREE THAT'S CRASHED ONE OF
SEVERAL ON THE STREET OUT OF
THE POWER LINES.
QUITE A MESS, QUITE A TASK.
THEY'RE VERY LUCKY.
THE SUSTAINED WINDS ONLY 75
MILES AN HOUR HERE.
MORE THAN DOUBLE DOWN ON THE
COAST.
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE
VIDEO THAT WAS SHOT IT'S REALLY
UNBELIEVABLE BECAUSE THEY
AREN'T DOING RECOVERY DOWN
THERE, THEY'RE DOING SEARCH AND
RESCUE.
THE GOVERNOR TOURING MEXICO
BEACH IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE IN
THIS HOUR.
BUT THEY ARE DOING A LOT OF
RESCUES AND EVACUATIONS EVEN OF
PEOPLE THAT DECIDED TO STAY
BEHIND.
OFFICIALS SAY THAT AS MANY AS
250 MAY HAVE STAYED BEHIND IN
MEXICO BEACH ALONE.
THAT'S A TOUGH TASK AS THE DAY
GETS GOING HERE, JON.
>> Jon: YOU WERE ABLE TO GET UP
IN THE AIR OVER MEXICO BEACH.
TELL US WHAT THAT WAS LIKE.
>> I GREW UP GOING AND PLAYING
AS A KID IN THE SANDS OF THE
PANHANDLE AND TO FLY OVER AND
SEE THIS FOOTAGE THAT WE SHOT
IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE
ENTIRE HOMES RIPPED OFF THEIR
FOUNDATIONS AND CAST ABOUT LIKE
A TOY HOUSE.
THE STREETS ABSOLUTELY
DESTROYED.
THE COMBINATION OF THE STORM
SURGE AND THE 155 MILE-AN-HOUR
UNPRECEDENTED CAT 4 WINDS
LEVELED THAT ENTIRE PLACE.
WHEN PEOPLE SAY IT LOOKS LIKE A
BOMB WENT OFF.
WHEN PEOPLE SAY IT WAS TOTALLY
DEVASTATED, IT IS REALLY NOT AN
OVERSTATEMENT.
IT IS CRAZY.
I ASKED THE PILOT.
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A SOUND BITE.
THE PILOT, BRANDEN, FLYING FOR
US.
I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS IT LIKE,
HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH GREAT
DAMAGE FROM A HURRICANE IN A
COASTAL AREA.
I'M GLAD I WASN'T THERE WHEN
THAT STORM CAME THROUGH.
I HOPE EVERYBODY GOT OUT SAFE
AND HOPEFULLY THEY GET
EVERYBODY TAKEN CARE OF AND GET
IT REBUILT QUICKLY.
IT WILL BE A LONG TIME BEFORE
IT'S EVER WHAT IT WAS BEFORE.
HOPEFULLY IT DOESN'T AFFECT
THEIR TOURISM TOO MUCH.
GREAT PEOPLE AROUND HERE.
HOPEFULLY THEY GET IT REBUILT
QUICK.
>> IN THE AIR WE SAW SEVERAL
BLACKHAWKS AND MEDEVAC
