NINE MONTHS, THAT IS WHEN THEY

74
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:05,186
STARTED THEIR LEAK STRATEGY,

75
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:05,953
INSURANCE POLICY.

76
00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:07,755
REMEMBER STRZOK SAID -- EVEN

77
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:11,759
THEY SAID IT, BUT THEY LIE ABOUT

78
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,026

79
00:02:12,027 --> 00:02:13,661
>> THAT IS WHAT I TRY TO STRESS,

00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:21,135
THEY NUMBER ONE, I KNOW THE

81
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:23,604
BACKGROUND.

82
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:24,338
>> Sean: PEOPLE WRITE THAT ALL

83
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:28,009
THE TIME.

84
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,380
>> ANYWAY, I INSISTED THERE WERE

85
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:33,581
SO MANY EXCULPATORY EVIDENCES,

86
00:02:33,582 --> 00:02:37,985
AND THAT IS WHY YOU -- REALLY

87
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:38,686
WISH THAT WE COULD COME OUT,

88
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:41,622
BECAUSE I KNOW THE SENTENCE

89
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:45,126
HAS BEEN FAIR, DOESN'T DESERVE.

90
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:49,197

91
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:50,565
DON'T OPEN BECAUSE IN TWO

92
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,200
WEEKS -- ANYONE CAN SUCK UP TWO

93
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:52,967
WEEKS OF THEIR LIFE, AND I

94
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:54,969
WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO OPEN

95
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,737
YOURSELF UP TO SOMETHING

96
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:56,070
FURTHER.

97
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:59,173
SO YOU ARE IN A TOUGH SPOT.

98
00:02:59,174 --> 00:03:00,575
BUT WHAT JOHN IS REPORTING IS

99
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:02,677
TRUE, ANYTHING YOU CAN ADD?

100
00:03:02,678 --> 00:03:03,945
>> ALL I CAN ADD ABOUT THIS IS

101
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:08,149
THAT JOHN IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

102
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,587
I HAVE NO RUSSIA CONTACTS

103
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:12,987
WHATSOEVER.

104
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:13,888

105
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:21,395

106
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:22,196
PEOPLE IN OUR INTELLIGENCE

107
00:03:22,197 --> 00:03:24,298
COMMUNITY KNEW IT THE WHOLE TIME

108
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,800
THAT THESE PEOPLE THAT I

109
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:26,467
ENCOUNTERED WERE ACTUALLY

110
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:27,135
WESTERN INTELLIGENCE, NOT

111
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:28,837
RUSSIAN CARED ONE OF MY

112
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,440
EARTH 100 HIM I GETTING IN

113
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,075
TROUBLE FOR?

114
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:36,844
I TOLD THIS PERSON, STAY AWAY

115
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:41,783
FROM ME.

116
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:44,385
>> Sean: JOHN, WHERE DO WE GO

117
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:44,786
WITH THIS?

118
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:46,587
>> SEAN, I HAVE TO TELL YOU

119
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:48,623
TONIGHT, THE SPIN COMING OUT OF

120
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:49,257
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS

121
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:51,058
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, I WOULD CALL

122
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:51,793
IT UN-AMERICAN.

123
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:52,894
PEOPLE TELLING ME THEY DON'T

124
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:53,861
THINK THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAD

125
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:57,899
AN OBLIGATION TO TELL THE COURTS

126
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,966
ABOUT EXCULPATORY INFORMATION.

127
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:00,568
THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND.

128
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,170
IN THE FISA COURT, WHERE THE

129
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:02,870
ACCUSED SOMEONE LIKE GEORGE,

130
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:04,772
DOESN'T HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE,

131
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:06,774
IT IS ALL IN SECRET, CAN YOU

132
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:08,376
IMAGINE THAT SENTIMENT BEING

133
00:04:08,377 --> 00:04:10,278
SHARED WITH CONGRESS, THE JUDGES

134
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,045
ON THE FISA COURT, I WOULD LIKE

135
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:12,079
TO SEE HOW LONG THAT LASTS.

136
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,582
>> Sean: HOW DO YOU DO AFTER

137
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,750
THIS?

138
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,785
>> LOOKING TO START A FAMILY.

139
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:18,519
>> Sean: GO AFTER PEOPLE THAT

140
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,853
I MISTREATED YOU?

141
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:23,024
>> ANYBODY THAT HAS MISTREATED

142
00:04:23,025 --> 00:00:00,000
ME I'M GOING AFTER.
