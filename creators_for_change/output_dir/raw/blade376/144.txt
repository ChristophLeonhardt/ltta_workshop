1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,290
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a very difficult</font>

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,990
video for me to do just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I don't</font>

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,480
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where to start I am currently</font>

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,870
shaking inside because as<font color="#CCCCCC"> always I do my</font>

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,000
thing on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thursday where I sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down in</font>

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,550
front of TV in the evening and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I watch</font>

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,020
BBC question time in which a panel of

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,150
politicians journalists just opinionated

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,449
people discuss about the weekly issues

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,029
while members of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public throw</font>

11
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,570
questions of why is this happening what

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,600
are you doing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you not</font>

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,140
putting forward a decent alternative why

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,290
aren't you showing a shadow budget to

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,850
what the current government are doing

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,260
half a million<font color="#CCCCCC"> people last week</font>

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,239
protested saying for no cuts because

18
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,539
there is an alternative I wonder if many

19
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,570
of the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that if I</font>

20
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,699
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask them what the alternative was</font>

21
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,530
if they'd actually be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a</font>

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,270
concise and meaningful answer the reason

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,490
i'm doing this video is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

24
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,340
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> time for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to be open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font>

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">i've been doing the past few months some</font>

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,470
people have accused me of joining a cult

27
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">because i have looked into the zeitgeist</font>

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,700
movement i have not joined the cult yep

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">i agree with some of the values the</font>

30
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,750
zeitgeist movement advocates and<font color="#CCCCCC"> The</font>

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Venus Project if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you wonder what the</font>

32
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,049
values are then you can look into all

33
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,619
that online but for me I don't follow

34
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,710
things blindly I've learn to become a

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,520
critical thinker to start questioning

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,950
about things in life not accepting the

37
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,470
way things are when you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

38
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,360
something you believe is wrong that's

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,100
not a negative thing it's a good thing

40
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,860
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows you to progress better</font>

41
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,759
as a human being and having worked with

42
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,979
the zeitgeist movement to find out what

43
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,770
values i do agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and how we</font>

44
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">can actually help the world I've come up</font>

45
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,220
with my own idea and having thought

46
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,580
about it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

47
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,090
sively for weeks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> months now I had a</font>

48
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,470
bit of an epiphany one that kind of

49
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,020
upset<font color="#CCCCCC"> me because I feel very alone on</font>

50
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,350
this I've given stories to you before

51
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,510
about how when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that secondary</font>

52
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,970
school I did a speech about bullying

53
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,920
against the system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the headmaster</font>

54
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,810
couldn't expel me because the teachers

55
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,450
agreed with what I said I worked with

56
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,250
the education<font color="#CCCCCC"> system saying how</font>

57
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,710
technology should be provided to allow

58
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">people to express their learnings in any</font>

59
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,030
way they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can because surely it's</font>

60
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,040
ludicrous that's spending two hours

61
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,720
writing an examination paper to reflect

62
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,260
14 weeks worth of lectures is just not a

63
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,709
great way of testing people there may be

64
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,930
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have genius ideas</font>

65
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,050
and genius contributions to society but

66
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,070
because they're better at articulating

67
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,150
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> through words are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> writing it down</font>

68
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,080
they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be seen as you know anyone</font>

69
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,769
with any real merit by the system and

70
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:19,540
then I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done stuff for the Foreign</font>

71
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,120
Office advice some digital diplomacy and

72
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,830
of course i had a therapy theory to help

73
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,730
people with depression which could help

74
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,830
millions of people for a fraction<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

75
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">price today the reason I can't do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

76
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,750
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I was to do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paper on it a</font>

77
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,209
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> could run with it and there be</font>

78
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:41,650
nothing I could do there was no security

79
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,280
there I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go on anymore</font>

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,590
with those examples but I had an

81
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,200
epiphany as I said and it's the fact

82
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,480
that i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have found a way we can</font>

83
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,910
bring the world together I've done

84
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,160
things like stick<font color="#E5E5E5"> aid before which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font>

85
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,350
raise<font color="#E5E5E5"> money for children in the poorest</font>

86
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,560
regions of the world the UNICEF charity

87
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,900
is a fantastic charity and having

88
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,420
started five years ago on a laptop in my

89
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,320
bedroom and you know had about 30,000

90
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,810
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> tuned in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 500 pounds to go to the</font>

91
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,779
last year in which 1.5 million zoomed-in

92
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,510
ave thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> was raised it shows you</font>

93
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,120
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet can achieve and what</font>

94
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,130
I've learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the years is that</font>

95
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,350
YouTube is a great platform

96
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,650
it's not the only place we can do stuff

97
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to translate what</font>

98
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,640
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do on YouTube into the real world</font>

99
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,740
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take it to the streets but</font>

100
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is a source that people can</font>

101
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,650
always rely on if you have a central

102
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,040
database of information people always

103
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,050
people will always<font color="#E5E5E5"> have somewhere to</font>

104
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,560
rely on<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example is WikiLeaks it</font>

105
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,150
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you think about it</font>

106
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,850
because the truth is people now look

107
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,800
online for what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on in the world</font>

108
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,630
they don't ask the leaders of their

109
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,270
country and say what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going on in</font>

110
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,220
other countries they find out online for

111
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,020
themselves and then they actually turn

112
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,720
to their politicians and they say this

113
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,550
is happening so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you doing about</font>

114
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">it governments have been held</font>

115
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,570
accountable power to the people and I

116
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,810
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a fantastic thing and the</font>

117
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,910
same thing with WikiLeaks New York Times

118
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,010
used to pay WikiLeaks to publish the

119
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,890
information but recently when WikiLeaks

120
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,630
got nominated<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a Nobel Peace Prize</font>

121
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,240
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> New</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> York Times got you know they</font>

122
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,620
distance themselves from Julian Assange

123
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,090
the founder of WikiLeaks and the

124
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,340
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they stopped publishing</font>

125
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,460
the articles they started vilifying him

126
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,710
saying how he's a loser etc and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

127
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,150
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what I think about</font>

128
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it it's just my opinion but you don't</font>

129
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,500
have to agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me on this I think</font>

130
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,390
it's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the New York Times realize</font>

131
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,620
they were shooting themselves in the

132
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,350
foot because they were publishing facts

133
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,180
which were already available for free

134
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,400
online and why on earth would people

135
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,090
want to pay for a newspaper to<font color="#CCCCCC"> read</font>

136
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,730
someone's opinions on facts when you

137
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,640
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the website WikiLeaks</font>

138
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,980
dog and see the facts<font color="#E5E5E5"> for yourself</font>

139
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,330
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no business in truth when it's</font>

140
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,970
just made completely transparent and

141
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,100
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world deserve transparency</font>

142
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,170
that's a different issue in terms of

143
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,850
WikiLeaks although actually there is

144
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,370
some relations with so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

145
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,040
we're going to get the world together it

146
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,320
comes in three parts and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

147
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,970
over this briefly I'm actually making

148
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,710
some intensive videos about this project

149
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,070
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand by me on this</font>

150
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,660
then please do get in touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

151
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,030
need

152
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">every one possible no matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what your</font>

153
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,790
passion is in life we are all related we

are all human beings and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should all</font>

155

stand by each other to ensure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

156

00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it should be us human beings</font>

159
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,750
and then being<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems such as</font>

160
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,780
disease famine and economical problems

161
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,720
etc so the first stage is to build a

162
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,750
database I have started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some people</font>

163
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,020
a wiki site and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

164
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,570
link problems to solutions based on a

165
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,510
scientific approach this<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that at</font>

166
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,430
the top of a page you'll have a question

167
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like why a gas price is going</font>

168
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,520
up and here you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a small</font>

169
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,160
paragraph that says what the problem is

170
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">with gas prices going up and a solution</font>

171
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">to how we can solve this straight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> under</font>

172
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Neath this paragraph you would have some</font>

173
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">FA cues questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like well what other</font>

174
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,490
forms of transport are there what other

175
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,490
forms of energy could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used and</font>

176
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,480
depending on what you click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it will</font>

177
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,370
take you down the page to these headings

178
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,410
where the questions are addressed by

179
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,870
further paragraphs short paragraphs

180
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,180
because people in this day and age have

181
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,740
a short attention span but then of

182
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,600
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> different parts of these</font>

183
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,080
paragraphs are clickable if it was about

184
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,030
what other forms of energy could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

185
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,040
apart from gas there may be saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

186
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,890
geothermal energy or<font color="#CCCCCC"> solar powered</font>

187
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,840
energy these words would be clickable

188
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,760
which would take you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> further articles</font>

189
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,800
which are more intensive and what you're

190
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing there is you're allowing people to</font>

191
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,550
educate themselves to the extent they

192
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,460
wish to be educated<font color="#E5E5E5"> people around the</font>

193
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">world and trying to indoctrinate their</font>

194
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,570
ideas by pressing it on other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people the</font>

195
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,620
best way you can do and help the world

196
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,170
best way you can help the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world is by</font>

197
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,929
giving people the choice by providing

198
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,760
people with all the information so they

199
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,350
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make up their own mind they can</font>

200
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,909
start questioning why is this not

201
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,490
happening because questioning is what I

202
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,980
think lacks in society<font color="#CCCCCC"> today critical</font>

203
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,090
thinking is saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have been</font>

204
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,580
taught at my school a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more and I'm</font>

205
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,970
sure many of you will feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same and</font>

206
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,410
so they will read the first paragraph

207
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">rough and go yeah there are these</font>

208
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,199
questions and then they will read that

209
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,850
and they will start to educate

210
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,379
themselves more but the fact it has to

211
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,990
be based on scientific approach is that

212
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything that is on this site needs to</font>

213
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,000
be backed up by scientific research this

214
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,310
is so so important or else it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

215
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,620
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have credibility therefore we</font>

216
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,120
can link problems into solutions not

217
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,040
based on political opinions and what

218
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,870
they're telling you when people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

219
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,970
question time now saying you said you're

220
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,230
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this why aren't you doing</font>

221
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,560
this in there now going to start saying

222
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,509
you said you were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this you</font>

223
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and this is why you</font>

224
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,660
haven't done it and this is what you

225
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be doing power to the people and</font>

226
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">I hate to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use that phrase but i'm sure</font>

227
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,949
you're with me on this so we build a

228
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,480
database like that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take a</font>

229
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,370
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people with</font>

230
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,290
expertise in different fields doing this

231
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,189
but then the second stage is to create

232
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:46,069
audience acquisition if you see saying

233
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:48,290
on the news<font color="#E5E5E5"> like students protesting</font>

234
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,480
about tuition fees that's something

235
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,069
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a problem we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

236
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:54,649
address so on a spreadsheet you list all

237
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:57,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook pages all the websites</font>

238
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,579
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is relating to activist</font>

239
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:03,410
groups that are protesting against<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

240
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,329
particular cause you list all their

241
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:07,189
contact details how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> followers they</font>

242
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,600
have and we start building relationships

243
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,019
once the database is set up and say we

244
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:15,050
understand what you're advocating and

245
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,019
what you would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protest about</font>

246
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:20,449
these are common values with a lot of

247
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">other groups</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and society and we can</font>

248
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,069
bring people<font color="#E5E5E5"> together because with a lot</font>

249
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:27,230
of activist groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> its reactionary you</font>

250
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,699
know people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with poverty</font>

251
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,589
what they're doing is there are poor

252
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,779
people there so we need to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

253
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,279
we given the resources they need which

254
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,050
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> always important but why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we</font>

255
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,029
look at the cause what is causing this

256
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:39,980
poverty and tackle that instead because

257
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,170
the course that one problem may actually

258
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,689
be the cause for many other problems and

259
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:46,550
if we address these issues this is how

260
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,089
we can bring the world together in that

261
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:52,430
sense and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third part of the</font>

262
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,949
project is the activism people take into

263
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:57,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">the streets 500 mid-feb sorry for half a</font>

264
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,839
million five hundred thousand last week

265
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,550
took to the streets<font color="#E5E5E5"> of London saying no</font>

266
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,510
cuts and as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I doubt many of the</font>

267
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,310
people actually could give you a

268
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,440
coherent argument to what they're

269
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,180
proposing they're just angry they've

270
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,520
lost their jobs or<font color="#E5E5E5"> losing their jobs</font>

271
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,580
very emotional what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is get</font>

272
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,140
rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this frustration in people's</font>

273
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,360
minds because frustration comes from

274
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,360
when there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no solution in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mind Egypt</font>

275
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,520
is a case study I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring up</font>

276
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,920
which I think holds a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Merit</font>

277
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,020
people were protesting quite peacefully

278
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,850
in Egypt because they had a solution in

279
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,220
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> they knew what they wanted changed</font>

280
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,170
they wanted president mubarak to step

281
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,720
down and when he said he wasn't going to

282
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,550
step down for a long period of time

283
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,770
people got angry because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution</font>

284
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">was no longer there he eventually</font>

285
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,900
stepped down and with no government in

286
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">place just the military people packed up</font>

287
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,670
and cleared up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next day and things</font>

288
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,240
return<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a new level of normality I</font>

289
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,460
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling that protests in England</font>

290
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,830
are going to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming they're going</font>

291
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be constantly occurring all over the</font>

292
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,540
world as people find that governments

293
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,240
are struggling<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with this</font>

294
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">structured deficit which is just insane</font>

295
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,950
so I guess what I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say is I</font>

296
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people think the system is</font>

297
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,380
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail I say if it's going to</font>

298
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">fail it's probably best we're just</font>

299
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,130
prepared and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sick to death of</font>

300
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,080
hearing politicians arguing about oh

301
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,390
we've done this the other party didn't

302
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,340
do this we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be working together</font>

303
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,810
not on beliefs and opinions but on

304
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,790
scientific fact because that is

305
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,920
something we can all agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in a way I</font>

306
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,620
suppose you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know because it will create</font>

307
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">the best result you know natural law is</font>

308
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,280
a fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing it doesn't matter what</font>

309
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">your religious belief is if you try and</font>

310
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,810
run up a wall you won't be able to

311
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,780
because of the law of<font color="#E5E5E5"> gravity and across</font>

312
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,460
all religions and beliefs there are

313
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,920
commonalities we want to treat people<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

314
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,050
you'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> treated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's expressed</font>

315
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,520
in many religions and that's such a

316
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,530
beautiful thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we all live</font>

317
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,030
by even so unlike<font color="#CCCCCC"> make you doesn't</font>

318
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,360
follow any particular religion we should

319
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,850
be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for each other and I</font>

320
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">think by identifying the problems and</font>

321
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,670
solutions based on science and I use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

322
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,380
word fact very loosely

323
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,050
I really feel this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can</font>

324
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,240
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done so this is actually what I've</font>

325
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on a lot lately it's what</font>

326
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,480
are we spending the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next few</font>

327
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,100
years working on I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how long</font>

328
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,200
it's going to take but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> realized</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

329
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like stick out a great because</font>

330
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,650
it's getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> money out there to those</font>

331
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,390
that need it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to start</font>

332
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at the bigger picture here the</font>

333
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,740
world is full of human beings we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font>

334
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,100
one you know you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about women's</font>

335
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,630
problems and Jewish problems and

336
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,830
whatever problems there are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

337
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,260
just human problems and a man called

338
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,080
jacque fresco said that in 1974 on an

339
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,760
interview which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very inspiring to me</font>

340
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,510
and many other people and I hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

341
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,730
daily we need to break down these

342
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,640
divisions these walls between countries

343
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,470
the internet is bringing people together

344
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,830
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

345
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">available to everyone so people aren't</font>

346
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,090
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work and saying all the</font>

347
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,070
politicians they get paid to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look after</font>

348
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">countries so that's all right I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

349
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,840
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more dangerous and actually what</font>

350
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,200
we need to do is allow everyone to have

351
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity to educate themselves as</font>

352
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,420
much as they wish to be educated so

353
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,310
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> this tall hasn't bored you</font>

354
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,800
I've tried to talk compost because as I

355
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,770
said I'm shaking inside I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

356
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a lot more passionate but that</font>

357
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,400
would it may have come across as

358
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,730
hysterical and I guess even<font color="#CCCCCC"> as i'm</font>

359
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,050
recording this now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not sure if i'm</font>

360
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,210
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> upload it but i'm just going to do</font>

361
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,370
it and see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your response is there</font>

362
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,050
are people who followed me on youtube a

363
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,760
to the past five years who stuck by all

364
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,480
my projects and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess i'm also getting</font>

365
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,340
shivers inside because this is the most

366
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,090
ambitious<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I've ever attempted and</font>

367
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,570
I guess for that reason it scares me

368
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,920
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot quite a few friends that</font>

369
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,410
believe me and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some that think</font>

370
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,430
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm aiming for st. too ambitious so</font>

371
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,170
i may say it's easier said than done to

372
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,880
build a database to link all problems

373
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,610
and solutions in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world but we've got</font>

374
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,860
to start somewhere and I think if it's

375
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,350
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help humanity and help these</font>

376
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,270
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are frustrated and taking to</font>

377
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,590
the streets

378
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,000
I think that's a cause worth fighting

379
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,180
for information for all we all need to

380
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,310
be problem solvers in this world because

381
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,660
I guess it's getting quite messy so on

382
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,280
that night thank you for tuning in as

383
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,490
always and I hope to hear from you very

384
00:15:44,490 --> 00:00:00,000
very soon IDs to the next time
