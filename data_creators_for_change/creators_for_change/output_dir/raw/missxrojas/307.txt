00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
hey guys happy one day first and

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,060
foremost I wanted to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,770
comments on my last video which was

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,930
about races and the book moondust by

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,370
Andrew Smith I asked you two questions

6
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,440
the first being what deserves our

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,269
sustained attention and the second what

8
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,519
has been mischaracterized as a race the

9
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,690
comments I got back were absolutely

10
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">amazing I really really enjoyed reading</font>

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,960
them just some trends and those coins

14
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,980
education is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that deserves our</font>

15
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,660
sustained attention but also as

16
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,890
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been mischaracterized</font>

17
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,890
as race<font color="#CCCCCC"> jaza</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rhyming with oranges</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brad</font>

18
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,630
and six impossible things all said that

19
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,250
climate change deserved I'll sustain

20
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,020
interest I read agree with that one

21
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,790
because I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in during</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my short</font>

22
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,680
life time we had a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years maybe but</font>

23
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,180
two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> at most when people were</font>

24
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,559
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really focused really paying</font>

25
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,559
attention to it and now not so much miss

26
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,969
and the final comment that promotes a

27
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,440
lot of thought for me which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the</font>

28
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,670
thing that deserves sustained attention

29
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,920
it's platonic friendships and the thing

30
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is mischaracterizes of race is</font>

31
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,120
romance and romantic relationships and

32
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,399
lastly regular commenter<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm bored 69</font>

33
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,809
talked about the race to tell an

34
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,460
original story is being something that

35
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,799
is completely mischaracterized instead

36
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,180
the focus should be placed on how you

37
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,040
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> that story</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's that that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

38
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,990
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today so as i said</font>

reread the Virgin Suicides since I wrote

46
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,000
my dissertation and my dissertation was

47
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,890
basically about the role of photographs

48
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,439
in 911 literature so in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> reread my</font>

49
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,729
attention was really caught by the

50
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,470
number of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the narrator's who</font>

as you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see here please don't touch</font>

57
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,770
when they switch between the language of

58
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,110
a report and talking as though you're in

59
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,340
the room with them but they always

60
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,649
always speak as a collective when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read</font>

61
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">it this time I was extremely aware of</font>

62
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,619
the fact that the book chooses not to

63
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,720
include actual photographs because a lot

64
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fudge glass mentioned all of things</font>

65
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,930
like houses things that could easily be

66
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,399
photographed and included a book

67
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,469
examples of books that<font color="#E5E5E5"> use such mixed</font>

68
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,560
media are<font color="#CCCCCC"> Austerlitz by WG Sebald miss</font>

71
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,149
favorite my dissertation on extremely

72
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,440
loud and incredibly close by jonathan

73
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,330
safran foer so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i started to think about</font>

74
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,130
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> emission of photographs in a way</font>

75
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,810
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i probably wouldn't have done prior</font>

76
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,580
to my dissertation I think before<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

77
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,980
the answer well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's book so you can't</font>

78
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">use your imagination would have sufficed</font>

79
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,250
whereas I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could be exploded a</font>

80
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,510
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys will</font>

81
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,950
help me out with that so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel like</font>

82
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,209
a big part the decision not to include

83
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:28,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual images is because this story</font>

84
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,570
completely privileges the voice of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

85
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,490
boys the boys tell the story<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

86
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,410
lisbon girls in trying to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

87
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,630
answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to have more contact</font>

88
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">with them they try and narrate this very</font>

89
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,370
linear narrative and they're basically

90
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,720
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find the cause for these girls</font>

91

suicides they also seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be trying to</font>

92
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,830
explain their obsession so it's as<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

93
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,300
they're like coming from a guilty place

94
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,920
in a way in order to explain their

95
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,660
obsession they need to be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> control of</font>

96
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,209
how you see their world again maintain a

97
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,280
sort of the universal interest in that

98
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,900
world the other thing I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really aware</font>

99
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,670
of now I'm probably wasn't aware of the

100
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,590
first few thousand times I read this

101
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,900
book was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these boys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are writing</font>

102
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,060
when they're so so much older<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yet</font>

103
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,430
still sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> like very young teenagers</font>

104
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,050
there's a sense of their obsession with

105
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,850
these teenage girls has made them

106
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,400
forever children whether that's true or

107
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,290
not is up to debate<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

108
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,030

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think the choice not to include</font>

110
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,810
photographs themselves says to you I

111
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,160
mean is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would even</font>

112
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,170

118
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,180
Sicilian not to show visual and a film

119
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,970
is overwhelmingly visual but I feel like

120
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the film comes from a completely</font>

121
