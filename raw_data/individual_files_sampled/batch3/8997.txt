IF YOU ARE SMUGGLING A CHILD THEN WE WILL PROSECUTE YOU. AND THAT CHILD MAY BE SEPARATED FROM YOU AS REQUIRED BY LAW. WE DON’T WANT TO SEPARATE FAMILIES, BUT WE DON’T WANT FAMILIES TO COME TO THE BORDER ILLEGALLY. EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THIS COUNTRY SEPARATES PARENTS AND CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE ARRESTED FOR A CRIME. THIS IS NO NEW POLICY. THERE IS NO BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR CHANGING THAT. IMMIGRATION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT IMMIGRANT CHILDREN. 1500 OF THEM, THE HEADLINE SAID HAD BEEN LOST UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S ADHERENCE TO THIS POLICY. HHS PUT OUT A STATEMENT REFUTING THAT, SAYING THE ASSERTION THAT UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN CHILDREN ARE LOST IS COMPLETELY FALSE. THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT LOST, THEIR SPONSORS ARE USUALLY FAMILY MEMBERS AND THEY HAVE BEEN VETTED IN CRIMINALITY AND THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR THEM AND COULD NOT BE REACHED BY THE VOLUNTARY WOULD CALL WAS MADE. IN MANY CASES SPONSORS CANNOT BE REACHED BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES ARE ILLEGAL ALIENS AND DO NOT WANT TO BE REACHED BY FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. SO, WHAT ABOUT THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY ON WHERE IMMIGRATION STANDS CURRENTLY, SO LET’S BRING IN THE PANEL. AND IT STEVE HAYES, EDITOR AND CHIEF AND MATT SCHLAPP, CONTRIBUTOR WITH THE HILL. MARA, THIS GOT LOTS OF ATTENTION. IT HAS A LOT OF ATTENTION AND HAS A LOT OF PARTS TO IT. ON ONE HAND, THESE CHILDREN BEING LOST IS NOT TRUE. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS YOU JUST HEARD THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MADE VERY CLEAR IT WANTED TO CONTINUE THAT BECAUSE IT’S A DETERRENT. DON’T BRING YOUR KIDS HERE ILLEGALLY BECAUSE YOU WILL GET SEPARATED FROM THEM. THEY DECIDED THEY WANTED TO BLAME IT ON DEMOCRATS EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS A POLICY THAT THEY CARRY THROUGH. Bret: BUT, STEVE, THE CHARACTERIZATION OF IT THEY DEPEND ON WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING OR READING. OR, THE POLICY WENT BACK A COUPLE OF ADMINISTRATIONS. IF THAT’S TRUE BUT THIS REALLY TOOK OFF OVER THE WEEKEND WHEN YOU HAD A FORMER OBAMA SPEECHWRITER JON FAVREAU AND OTHERS PUTTING THIS OUT THERE, PUTTING UP PICTURES OF CHILDREN IN CAGES AND IT WAS OUTRAGEOUS. BECAUSE IT WAS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DOING THIS, FAILING TO NOTE THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED AS YOU SAY UNDER PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. SO THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT POURED FUEL ON THIS PROVERBIAL FIRE, IF YOU WILL. THERE’S NO QUESTION THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO TAKE A TOUGH STAND ON ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS WHICH ARE UP AFTER INITIALLY GOING DOWN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BY SAYING THIS, AND MAKING THIS PART OF THEIR POLICY. WE SAW WITH THE POWER OF PRESIDENTIAL RHETORIC AND THE POWER OF ADMINISTRATION RHETORIC DID TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TRYING TO COME ACROSS THE BORDER. I THINK THAT IS THEIR GOAL HERE AND WE COULD DEBATE WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT POLICY OR NOT. THEY HAVE SAID, BOTH JOHN KELLY AND CHIEF OF STAFF WHO JUST PLAYED, THEY MADE CLEAR THAT THEY VIEW THIS AS AN EFFECTIVE DETERRENT. Bret: I ALWAYS SAY THE DISCLAIMER OR I TRY TO COME UP YOUR WIFE WORKS FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE THOUGHT PROCESS IS, BEHIND OF THIS MOVE? ARE THEY PUSHING BACK BEHIND THE BAD NEWS STORIES ON THIS OR IS THAT A STRATEGY HERE THAT’S DEVELOPING ON THE IMMIGRATION? BRETT, BE CAREFUL GETTING INTO THE MIND OF YOUR SPOUSE. THE ONLY THING THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS DOING DIFFERENTLY THAN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE WITH UNACCOMPANIED MINORS, IT’S A CRIMINAL VIOLATION ONE IT COMES TO ADULTS TRYING TO CROSS OUR BORDERS ILLEGALLY. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE KIDS? WHAT HERE ARE THE IS THE KICKER. ALMOST ALL OF THEM WILL STAY IN AMERICA FOR AS LONG AS THEY WAN WANT. LET’S WE ALWAYS SEND HOME WE ONLY SENT HOME SOMETHING LIKE FIVE KIDS LAST YEAR. IF AN UNACCOMPANIED MINOR GETS TO OUR BORDER, THEY STAY IN AMERICA. AND MOST OF THEM, OR GIVING, GIVEN A PLACE TO SAY, THEY ARE GIVEN TO RELATIVES WHO ARE THEMSELVES HERE ILLEGALLY. SO WHEN DEMOCRATS SAY THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LOST 1500 KIDS, MARA’S RIGHT, THAT’S NOT ACCURATE. WE’VE ACTUALLY LOST 20 MILLION PEOPLE AND OF THOSE 20 MILLION PEOPLE ARE BRINGING IN MORE RELATIVES TO THE BORDER. THAT’S WHY WHETHER YOU BUILD A WALL OR NOT, WE HAVE PROBLEMS OF THE BORDER THAT THERE ARE ALL THESE LOOPHOLES THAT ALLOW YOU TO HOPSCOTCH IN LINE TO BE IN AMERICA IF YOU WANT TO BE. Bret: THE KEY POINT HERE IS THE REASON THE LAW STORY IS NOT ACCURATE IS BECAUSE THEY WERE CALLING THESE. AND THEY DIDN’T RETURN A, JOHN KELLY, JEFF SESSIONS SAYING, WE ARE GOING TO SEPARATE THESE KIDS AS A LAW SAYS WE SHOULD, SO DON’T BRING THEM. ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY FEEL THAT THEY WANT TO BLAME THAT SEPARATION ON DEMOCRATS. Bret: BUT DO YOU THINK THIS IS A POLITICAL ISSUE, ONE THAT’S POWERFUL FOR THE DEMOCRATS? WE WANT TO SAY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS HEARTLESS. BUT WHAT IS SO INTERESTING TO ME IS THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES HAVE A SOUP TOP SPOT IN THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE. THE DACA KIDS, HE OFTEN SAYS HE LOVES THEM AND WANTS TO TREAT THEM WITH A GREAT HEART. HE CLEARLY DOESN’T WANT TO BE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE STORY. Bret: AND STEVE, LAST WORD. THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE AS WE HEAD TOWARD THE MIDTERMS? THAT’S EASY. I CAN EASILY PREDICT WHAT’S HAPPENING. ACTUALLY NOBODY KNOWS. THE SHORT TERM, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE AND THERE IS NOT CONSENSUS ON HOW THEY SHOULD PROCEED IN THE HOUSE. WE HAVE MORE RESTRICTION EFFORTS LIKE THE GOOD LEGISLATION THAT CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR A LONG TIME. AND, THE LONGER TERM IS, HOW
