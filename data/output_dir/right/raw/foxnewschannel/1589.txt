MALIGN ACTIVITIES AND SUPPORT OF

00:00:03,974 --> 00:00:04,674
TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE ACROSS

3
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:06,309
THE REGION.

4
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:07,410
>> Martha: SO WHERE ARE WE

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,645

TRAINING ALEX CLOSELY,

7
00:00:09,846 --> 00:00:10,447
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM,

8
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:12,682
SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN WHO

00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,856
>> Martha: ISN'T IT A GREAT

14
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:20,257
PLACE TO BE?

15
00:00:20,257 --> 00:00:21,191
THANKS FOR BEING UP HERE ON THE

16
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:23,226
ROOF WITH US TONIGHT.

17
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:24,861
IT'S PUT UP MIKE POMPEO'S TWEET

18
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:25,862
HERE TODAY.

19
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:26,863
THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE.

20
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:27,898
HE SAYS TO THE IRANIAN PEOPLE,

21
00:00:27,898 --> 00:00:30,066
DO YOU WANT YOUR COUNTRY TO BE

22
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:31,434
KNOWN AS A COCONSPIRATOR WITH

23
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:34,070
HEZBOLLAH, HAMAS, TALIBAN AND

24
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:34,437
AL QAEDA?

25
00:00:34,437 --> 00:00:35,205
THE UNITED STATES SAYS YOU

26
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:36,072
DESERVE BETTER.

27
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:37,240
WHERE IS THIS GOING?

28
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,875
>> I LOVE WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

29
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,645
WE'VE HAD EIGHT YEARS OF WEAK

30
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:42,112
FOREIGN POLICY.

31
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:42,779
JOHN KERRY AND BARACK OBAMA

32
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:45,248
WOULD HAVE CRAWLED THROUGH GLASS

33
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:47,017
TO GET A DEAL WITH THE IRANIANS.

34
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:48,618
IT'S A TERRIBLE DEAL.

35
00:00:48,618 --> 00:00:50,420
AFTER TEN YEARS, ALL THE

36
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,254
RESTRICTIONS ON THE ENRICHMENT

37
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:52,255
PROGRAM GO AWAY.

38
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:53,857
I'M GLAD WE WITHDREW, BUT HERE'S

39
00:00:53,857 --> 00:00:55,225
WHAT YOU NEED TO ASK THE

40
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:56,026
EUROPEANS, WHY ARE YOU STANDING

41
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:58,662
WITH THE AYATOLLAH?

42
00:00:58,662 --> 00:00:59,829
THE ARABS AND ISRAELIS ARE WITH

43
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:00,630
US.

44
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,364
I THINK THE IRANIAN PEOPLE WANT

45
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:02,966
TO BE WITH US.

46
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:04,099
WHEN THEY WENT OUT TO THE

47
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,635
STREETS THEY GOT SHOT DOWN LIKE

48
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:05,936
DOGS.

49
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:07,671
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK AYATOLLAH

50
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:08,872
WOULDN'T KILL YOUR KIDS IF YOU

51
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:09,940
WOULD KILL HIS OWN KIDS?

52
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,041
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK

53
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,976
IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE

54
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:14,644
EUROPEAN ALLIES?

55
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:15,612
CLEARLY LIVING THE

56
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:16,346
STATE DEPARTMENT IS DISCUSSING

57
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:17,447
THIS WITH THEM AND WANTS THEM TO

58
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:19,616
COME ALONG WITH THE DEAL.

59
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,785
>> THEY WILL FOLD LIKE A CHEAP

60
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:22,252
SUIT.

61
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:23,820
IF YOU HAVE TO PICK WITH THE

62
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,821
AMERICAN ECONOMY AND THE IRANIAN

63
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:25,956
ECONOMY YOU WILL PICK THE

64
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:27,857
AMERICAN ECONOMY.

65
00:01:27,857 --> 00:01:28,825
THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU WANT

66
00:01:28,825 --> 00:01:30,860
FROM THE EUROPEANS WHEN IT COMES

67
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,062
TO DEALING WITH ROGUE NATIONS

68
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:33,830
LIKE IRAN.

69
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,931
AGAIN, THE EUROPEANS AND THE

70
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:36,433
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PUT IRAN ON

71
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:37,834
A PATHWAY TO A BOMB.

72
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:39,302
DONALD TRUMP HAS GIVEN THEM A

73
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:40,103
DIFFERENT CHOICE.

74
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:41,838
YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER LIFE, BUT

75
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:42,872
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE

76
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:44,641
THE LIFE YOU ARE LEADING.

77
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:47,310
YOU HAVE TO STOP DESTROYING THE

78
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,047
MIDDLE EAST, TRUMP HAS BEEN

79
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:52,248
DEALT A TOUGH HAND WITH

80
00:01:52,248 --> 00:01:53,617
NORTH KOREA AND IRAN AND I LIKE

81
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:55,118
THE WAY HE'S PLAYING THE HAND.

82
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:56,252
TELL THE EUROPEAN ALLIES STAND

83
00:01:56,252 --> 00:01:57,253
UP FOR YOUR VALUES.

84
00:01:57,253 --> 00:01:59,422
WHAT YOU HAVE IN COMMON WITH THE

85
00:01:59,422 --> 00:01:59,789
AYATOLLAH?

86
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,624
>> Martha: ARE WE ENCOURAGING

87
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:02,492
REVOLT ON THE PART OF THE

88
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:03,426
IRANIAN PEOPLE?

89
00:02:03,426 --> 00:02:04,394
>> THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

90
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:05,528
>> Martha: WE DIDN'T BACK THEM

91
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:05,795
UP.

92
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:06,563
I'M WONDERING WHAT WE ARE GOING

93
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:07,764
TO DO THIS TIME.

94
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:10,032
>> REMEMBER WHEN THE YOUNG LADY

95
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:11,635
HAD A SIGN IN THE CECUM ARE YOU

96
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:14,037
WITH US OR ARGUE WITH THEM,

97
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:14,504
PRESIDENT OBAMA?

98
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:16,373
HE CLEARLY DIDN'T WANT TO

99
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:17,707
JEOPARDIZE HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH

100
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:18,441
THE IRANIAN REGIME.

101
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:21,011
LOOK WHAT THEY GOT YOU, A

102
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:22,412
STRONGER IRAN.

103
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:23,747
THEY'VE GOT MORE CAPABILITY TO

104
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:24,514
WREAK HAVOC ON ISRAEL THAN THEY

105
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:26,650
DID BEFORE THE DEAL.

106
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,851
>> Martha: IS THIS

107
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:28,885
NORTH KOREAN SUMMIT GOING TO

108
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:30,854
HAPPEN ON JUNE 12TH?

109
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:32,455
>> IN THE LAST 30 DAYS TRUMP HAS

110
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:33,823
DONE TO COPE VERY BOLD THINGS.

111
00:02:33,823 --> 00:02:36,259
HE SAID I WILL SIT DOWN

112
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,427
PERSONALLY WITH KIM JONG UN TO

113
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:38,795
FIND A WAY TO AVOID A WAR WITH

114
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:39,262
NORTH KOREA.

115
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:40,864
I WILL GET OUT WITH OF A BAD

116
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:41,931
DEAL WITH IRAN TO SEE IF I CAN

117
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:43,266
GET A BETTER DEAL.

118
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:44,834
HE'S DOING THE THINGS I WOULD

119
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,670
HOPE YOU WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT.

120
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,937
IF THE NORTH KOREANS STIFFED

121
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:50,106
HIM, IF THEY SAT DOWN AND MEET

122
00:02:50,106 --> 00:02:51,074
WITH HIM AND TRY TO PLAY THEM

123
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:53,243
THEY ARE GOING TO GET IT.

124
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:56,413
AND IF THEY DON'T MEET JUNE

125
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:57,947
JUNE 12TH.

126
00:02:57,947 --> 00:02:58,748
THAT'S PROBABLY THE END

127
00:02:58,748 --> 00:02:59,115
DIPLOMACY.

128
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:01,851
PLAN B WOULD BE THE MILITARY TO

129
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:02,886
STOP THE THREAT NORTH KOREA

130
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:03,286
PRESENTS.

131
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:04,721
I HOPE WE DON'T GO DOWN THAT

132
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:05,855
ROAD BUT TRUMP WILL HAVE NO

133
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:07,657
OTHER CHOICE IF THE SUMMIT IS

134
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:08,391
CANCELED AND NORTH KOREA DOESN'T

135
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:09,426
WANT TO WORK WITH US IN GOOD

136
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:11,528
FAITH TO MAKE IT A WIN-WIN, THEN

137
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:13,897
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A CONFLICT

138
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:15,331
BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND

139
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:16,433
KIM JONG UN AND TRUMP WILL WIN.

140
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:17,634
>> Martha: WHAT YOU THINK

141
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:18,768
ABOUT THE REPORTS THAT THE

142
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:20,837
PRESIDENT BECAME ENAMORED OF

143
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:21,571
THIS IDEA THAT MAYBE HE WOULD

144
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:24,040
GET THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.

145
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,275
>> I STARTED THAT, BY THE WAY.

146
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:28,344
>> Martha: THAT MADE HIM WANT

147
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:29,379
TO STEAL ENOUGH THAT HE WAS

148
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:30,547
WILLING TO SORT OF MAKE IT

149
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:32,282
HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT.

150
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:33,383
HOW THE STORIES ARE THAT HE

151
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:34,984
DOESN'T WANT TO BE EMBARRASSED

152
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:36,152
THERE AND HE'S LOOKING

153
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:39,823
POTENTIALLY FOR A WAY TO NOT DO

154
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:40,090
IT.

155
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,024
>> I TALKED TO HIM THREE DAYS

156
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:41,291
AGO.

157
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,058
HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD ME, HE SAID

158
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:44,994
I'M GOING TO END THIS ONE WAY OR

159
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:45,462
ANOTHER.

160
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:47,030
I DON'T WANT A NEW WAR WITH

161
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,031
NORTH KOREA.

162
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:50,233
IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING FOR THE

163
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,634
THE REGION, BUT THEY WOULD LOSE

164
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:52,268
IT, NOT US.

165
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:53,903
I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN WITH THIS

166
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:59,642
GUY AND TRY TO FIND A WIN-WIN.

167
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,211
I'M GOING TO TELL TRY AND I NEED

168
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:02,278
YOUR HELP, UP YOUR GAME.

169
00:04:02,278 --> 00:04:04,214
AT THE END OF THE DATE DOES

170
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:05,515
DONALD TRUMP HAVE THE RESOLVE TO

171
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:07,083
BE DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER

172
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:07,450
PRESIDENT?

173
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,218
DOES HE REALLY MEAN IT WHEN HE

174
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:09,853
SAYS HE WANTS A BETTER DEAL WITH

175
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:11,054
THE IRANIANS AND HE'S NOT GOING

176
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:12,655
TO GIVE IN WHEN IT GETS ONE?

177
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:13,523
DOES HE REALLY MEAN THAT HE

178
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:15,325
WOULD STOP NORTH KOREA FROM

179
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:16,159
GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON THAT

180
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:19,495
COULD HIT AMERICA AND USE

181
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:21,064
MILITARY FORCE IF HE HAD TO?

182
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:22,065
HERE'S WHAT I THINK.

183
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:24,134
I THINK HE REALLY MEANS IT AND

184
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:26,870
IF HE MISJUDGE OR MISS

185
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,438
CALCULATES, IT WILL BE THE

186
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:29,205
BIGGEST MISTAKE NORTH KOREA EVER

187
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:29,839
MAKES.

188
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,241
I DON'T WANT TO WORK, BUT IF A

189
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:32,342
WAR IS GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S

190
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:34,644
GOING TO BE IN THEIR BACKYARD,

191
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:35,078
NOT OURS.

192
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:35,879
>> Martha: YOU'VE BEEN AROUND

193
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,881
THIS TOWN A LONG TIME.

194
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:39,015
YOU RAN FOR PRESIDENT.

195
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:41,050
>> I FINISHED IN THE TOP 15.

196
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,452
>> Martha: I REMEMBER.

197
00:04:42,452 --> 00:04:44,020
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS FBI

198
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,721
SITUATION AND WHETHER OR NOT

199
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,389
THEY HAD AN INFORMANT WHO WAS

200
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,224
TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP

201
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:48,625
CAMPAIGN?

202
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,261
>> IT COMES FROM A THIRD WORLD

203
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:52,228
MODEL, SOMETHING THAT SORT OF

204
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:54,030
SMALL COUNTRIES DO.

205
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,832
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS THAT

206
00:04:55,832 --> 00:04:56,633
ALL ABOUT?

207
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:57,834
YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE

208
00:04:57,834 --> 00:04:58,668
ADMINISTRATION SPYING ON

209
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:00,937
ANOTHER.

210
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,438
DIDN'T, BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF

211
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:03,239
JUSTICE AND THE FBI GAVE CLINTON

212
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,440
A PASS.

213
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,276
IF HE HAD DONE WHAT SHE HAD DONE

214
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:09,479
HE WOULD BE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW.

215
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,115
I'VE SEEN BIAS AT THE DEPARTMENT

216
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:13,783
OF JUSTICE REGARDING THE CLINTON

217
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:15,418
EMAIL INVESTIGATION.

218
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:16,019
I'VE SEEN BIAS AGAINST

219
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,154
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT THE FBI AND

220
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:20,223
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

221
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:22,225
I'VE SEEN DOCUMENTS FROM A PAID

222
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:22,959
POLITICAL INFORMANT, FOREIGN

223
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,627
AGENT WORKING WITH THE RUSSIANS

224
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:25,862
PAID BY THE DEMOCRATS TO GET A

225
00:05:25,862 --> 00:05:27,630
WARRANT ON AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.

226
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,765
THAT ALL BOTHERS ME SO I HOPE

227
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:31,534
SOMEBODY WILL LOOK AT IT, MAYBE

228
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:32,602
MR. HORWITZ IS THE RIGHT GUY BUT

229
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:33,837
I THINK WE NEED A SPECIAL

230
00:05:33,837 --> 00:05:34,237
COUNSEL.

231
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:36,472
>> Martha: A SECOND SPECIAL

232
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:37,440
COUNSEL?

233
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,174
>> THIS JUST REALLY STINKS TO

234
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:38,875
HIGH HEAVEN.

235
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,376
I'M ALL FOR MUELLER DOING HIS

236
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:41,144
JOB BUT THERE'S NOT ONE DEMOCRAT

237
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:43,346
WHO SEEMS TO CARE ONE BIT ABOUT

238
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:44,647
THE FACT THAT ALL THIS IS

239
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:45,448
HAPPENING.

240
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:47,517
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE SHOE ON THE

241
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:48,451
OTHER FOOT?

242
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:49,185
SOMEONE WAS INVESTIGATING TRUMP

243
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:52,255
AND THE HEAD OF THE FBI

244
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,823
INVESTIGATING TEAM HATED TRUMP

245
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:55,024
AND LIKE CLINTON?

246
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:56,626
IT WOULD BE ON THE FRONT PAGE --

247
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:57,894
WHAT IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAD

248
00:05:57,894 --> 00:00:00,000
HIRED SOMEBODY TO GO TO RUSSIA
