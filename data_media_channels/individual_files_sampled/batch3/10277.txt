now has been revealed that almost 80% of nurseries in the UK have banned toy weapons over fears they encourage aggressive behavior at the poll findings come almost a one-month after Prince George was photographed with a toy gun a critics say banning toy weapons constrains a child's imagination and stops traditional playground games that encourage exercise and fresh air well to debate the issue we invited a political activist George bada and a media campaign oh excuse me media commentator and Neil Wallace kids play with toys they turn anything into toy guns why on earth we tend to obsess that activity at that age is going to turn them into serial killers later for me for me that's not fun now it seems to me by the way this isn't like a government sort of nanny state can I finish Mike can I finish my point Neil please like this is not the nanny state saying please don't do it the question is how do I in relation to my four-year-old try and relate to these things and the last thing I'm saying is you know demonize children because they want it you know they're playing things out in a certain way and going bang bang I mean for its start you know kids will do that anyway without the toy guns I just think the idea of making fun of something that is a sterling essentially a killing machine is a complicated thing you were mentioning that you're a grown man with a four-year-old well funnily enough I'm a grown man with a 24 year old and he played with guns when he was young and he's not turned into a serial killer and so it's not that I'm saying no parent should be allowed to hire guns are Toya going to be banned what I'm saying is it is a decision for parents the point is we have a an element of society that simply wants to dictate everything so the next element of this is girls must not play with dollies they must not imitate mummy playing with dollies because they will want to have babies and they'll start having sex and they're going to be under Mac unmarried mothers at 12 but for me there's no comparison the fact is that making play out of nurture is I think a very very good thing for children making layout of people killing each other so that when they grow up as I did what is in their heads when they think killing is all the fun of play and the fun of killing on TV and the fun of war movies just let them go out in the yard and play and make noise and do whatever they want and stop trying to control them you
