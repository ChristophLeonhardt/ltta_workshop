Donald Trump is in China and particularly because of his long history and recent history of saying extremely inflammatory things about China its economy and the fact that it was the place where they came up with the hoax for climate change you might think that during this trip we would have a fiery press conference where they would ask him hard questions about China but that is not going to happen caitlin collins tweeted from a conversation with sarah Sanders about this Sarah Huckabee Sanders asked why he didn't take questions from reporters today Sarah Sanders said it was at the Chinese insistence there were no questions today and so theoretically it would be nice as he has had in all of those other countries that he and the foreign leader would come together and be asked questions from the media of the US and the host country but they don't want to do that because it's China and they have at best an extremely tense relationship with press free or otherwise and so unless you push them to have a free press present at the meeting it's not going to happen and we know this because in the past it has happened Presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush insisted on taking questions from reporters at their respective press conferences in this same situation when President Barack Obama visited China back in 2014 she under duress took one loan question from a member of the press belonging to a Chinese state newspaper but at least in that case Barack Obama was there to answer questions as well Jay Carney former press secretary said I once had to tell Chinese officials that President Obama would not show up for the press avail unless there would be a Q&A and they backed down and they did that because we put forward some strength and insisted that they do it Trump didn't do that this is the guy who said you know he is the one who's gonna get them to respect us again he's gonna go abroad and be strong and he just folds you look like a like a flan and so we don't have any questions and so you know it would be nice for the the Chinese made it'd be able to ask any questions maybe our reporters would be able to finally get some answers out of the leadership of China's what's the question do you think the Chinese President didn't want to hear from anyone they said particularly have an issue with foreign media like well there's something that they miss about human rights questions about you know some of their economic development strategies did you two talk about the Twitter 15 to 20 different rallies that the that aren't that the u.s. president conducted during the entire campaign where he said your money manipulators you made up global warming you're stealing from us I'm gonna come and I'm gonna kick some ass did he kick their asses back in the meeting well we actually why don't we go to the video because we've got an interesting new spin on that strategy a video that was found by this guy jr. let's take a look at that both the United States and China will have a more prosperous future if we can achieve a level economic playing field right now unfortunately it is a very one-sided and unfair one but but I don't blame China after all who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens I give China great credit one who was in that ready office yeah everyone's in that meeting was like is he talking about right now he's totally took advantage of him read before he came back out here exactly by the way how so he's reading this again they don't like teleprompter so he's reading a piece of paper how did they write the name of the country for him to pronounce it yeah and so look he's I guess this is sort of being more diplomatic aside from the whole anti you know the media thing this qualifies as high diplomacy for him exactly yeah I mean this is a and just to go back to your first point I think they're all too happy the White House that the restrictions on the press are what they are in China so that they don't have to have their guy out there a riffing with some question that is asked in a press conference even in the control media situation but yeah this is a this is big diplomacy for Donald Trump that he turned down the heat a little bit in fact you know he was much tougher on the Japanese really than he was on the on the Chinese yeah yeah and look we can we can all think of a lot of really uncomfortable questions they could have asked they they could have asked him so do you still believe that that guy over there invented climate change that would be an interesting thing for him to respond to the the currency manipulation what they would do if China didn't stop manipulating its currency you know how are your your factories making your ties and suit jackets how they doing they're down the street there would be a lot of really interesting questions not gonna be invited into the press pool now probably not so the question becomes is he weak and any fee bow down to a foreign leader like I didn't want it that Obama always did or is it he was they talk backstage and said you know what is a good chance for me not to speak to the media cuz I don't like doing it either because we know how Trump is I read a story from February about how the Chinese president who came in late in 2012 he has of course the state media and he looks for lords I'm read a couple pieces and I was you think about how this is comparable to where our president is there was photographs from this particular state run media photographs told fawning journalists crowding around mr. G who sat in Akers desk on the state television network does that look like a network with fawning journalists they do have Frankie mr. president rhythm Hannity yeah the Chinese news media it also exists to serve as a propaganda tool for the Communist Party and it must pledge its fealty to mr. G it also said that there's he looks for particularly for military leaders and other important figures since the whole last year yeah so the point being he needs loyalty who's all about loyalty he needs a media that makes sure they tell the good stories about what's happening that's also in this article I was like men this isn't even like a mistake I thought maybe they were like oh we don't know the history of them trying to force this lack of media communication maybe just stupid they probably sat back and talked and said you know we both have the same agenda here or at least we want to get to the same end point of not answering any questions this is great you're getting along perfectly do know that we're exactly the same they don't even need to have that conversation of course you just know that that's gonna proceed but I I was struck by the same thing that that Donald Trump has to be looking at she and going you know this is the guy and the setup that I want right he's got a media that he completely controls he is baked into the system now so he controls everything I mean it's a it's an authoritarian regime and and honestly I mean it's it's a kingdom and that's what Donald Trump wanted yeah so I think this China thing he just looks over at Xi and it's like a wet dream he's division you know he wished any word it was you were the chance yeah and look it back domestically we've got that situation with the Justice Department pressuring AT&T and Time Warner that if they're gonna be able to do their merger they have to sell off random company CNN to be fair that's right I don't know we need you to sell something like CNN rice itself see all of a sudden this this administration which cares nothing about this sort of thing it's a free market after all I mean mergers are happen all the time that should be you know anyway we get to that story but exactly but yes that he wants his version of what the Chinese president has yeah now we also have heard reports that they've there's a series of agreements that they've come to that are supposed to amount to two hundred and fifty billion dollars of increased economic activity between the two countries if that actually happens that's probably great for both countries that sounds good but we also heard that carrier wasn't going to ship a bunch of their jobs abroad and we just found out again today that they're shipping hundreds more and so we've heard these things before so we have to you know give it some time see if it actually happens but one random thing that just to close this out that Trump could have done perhaps is in this particular country in China obviously there's a lot of freedoms that we enjoy they do not have and one of the things they don't have is the same sort of access to a lot of forms of social media that there are crackdowns on and all of that and then Twitter is certainly one of those in China for a guy a president who spends 22 percent of his day on Twitter he could push on that topic perhaps think about all the followers you could get Donald if you just had the the entirety of the population of China suddenly signing honesty I don't know if that's the most of degree of him of this story but they said he had some kind of technology it was a yes suite while he's there yeah he can but why did you need that's the kind of person he is he's like as long as that get that is probably here but there's no aspect of this trip that's really designed to push back on China in any way he wanted to get concessions to China at least begin something with China on Korea and that that was bizarre because as you know they say hey we're already you know we're already on it believe me we're committed to the denuclearization of North Korea and then he wanted something on trade he wanted to make those remarks which we've just heard and they were they were a back massage compared to what he did to the Japanese and yet we that we have a much bigger trade deficit with the Chinese than we to the Japanese so it made no sense that he he I think is just moving through the situation is just trying to photo op it in essence help us build the independent media together come join us TYT Network comm slash join
