00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,520
When Gustav Mahler was still alive in
the early 1900s,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,990
you see these caricatures of him and
it's crazy gestures his arms are up he's

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,070
jumping up and down on the podium,
extremely large gestures. At the same

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,289
time Richard Strauss another composer
living in the same city basically was

5
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,540
conducting his own music like this.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,220
You know, barely moving and if you think this

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,300
is a quiet part in his music you're
wrong.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,060
He thought the role of a conductor

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,520
was to organize the music and keep
everything calm.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,360
Our biggest job as a

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,420
conductor, it's to do justice to the
composer.

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,620
My name is James Gaffigan I am

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,600
a conductor.

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,539
What the public needs to
understand about conducting is it's an

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,180
anticipatory art, so what we do takes
place before the music happens.

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,860
Rhythmic hand goes up before the music starts and
this hand will give a gesture before

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,100
that sound.

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,960
I've always found it strange to hold a

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,840
baton and it's a very strange thing,
because why why is it there in the first

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,540
place? But the fact of the matter is is
it is an extension of your arm.

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,670
If you just make a gesture like this, you just
need to move your wrist and you don't

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,080
have to be doing this all the time.

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,900
Your right hand is mainly for keeping rhythm

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:32,620
or keeping the beat patterns, so if you
give an upbeat this is 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4.

25
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:39,000
If you have 2 4, it's very simple so 1 2
1 2 and you could be as small as this

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,100
they'll realize that this is 2 4.

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,940
From the left hand has a much more complex,

28
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:49,170
strange role in our physical world and
it's freer

29
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,060
to do things that are out of the
ordinary.

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,340
It could be anything from

31
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,920
showing where a phrase goes,

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,520
it could show speed of a bow.

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,100
String players are very physical in the sense
that they they react to what they see. If

34
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,818
you have your left hand open and if you
have your right hand slightly open and

35
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,819
you're holding this sound like as if
you'd hold a baby

36
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,300
they'll play that way.

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,020
If you conduct like this they're gonna

38
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,080
play like this.

39
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,379
Percussion needs clarity
from a conductor. They need to know where

40
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,040
to hit something and the bass drum could
play only one note in an hour-long

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,980
symphony, but that note is very important.

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,820
The worst thing you could do to a brass
player before he or she plays is this.

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,160
Because if they see the hand before they
have to make the beautiful sound that

44
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,670
they need to make it's gonna destroy
their confidence and it's gonna make

45
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,940
their lives very difficult.

46
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,290
Playing the French Horn, there's so much that person

47
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,820
needs to think about and it's such a
delicate instrument, such a delicate moment.

48
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,740
Leonard Bernstein was one of the
greatest musicians who who had ever

49
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,560
lived, not just as a conductor but as a
pianist and as a composer.

50
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,340
He was able to

51
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,480
educate not just adults but children. Of
course when you watch him, he's always

52
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,170
dancing and he can't he can't help
moving around the podium and his rhythm

53
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,200
is contagious.

54
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,600
Karajan believed in beautiful sound,

55
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,680
upholstered sound, luxurious sound. So if
you hear some of the great recordings of

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,209
Karajan, it's not always together at
these crucial moments but there's a

57
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,239
beauty of sound always from beginning to
end.

58
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,660
I mean he had his eyes closed half the
time and everything was he was just

59
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,180
holding this precious thing all the time
and crouched over.

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,820
Carlos Kleiber was all

61
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:48,000
you know, he was holding a magic wand.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,530
He was fantasy, pure fantasy. He would

63
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,240
make beautiful story lines to pieces
that didn't have story lines.

64
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,320
He was all about this gesture and these beautiful
sweeping gestures.

65
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,320
I don't believe in

66
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,790
jumping around during a Bruckner
symphony, I think there's something

67
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,660
sacred and it's unnecessary.

68
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,889
I do believe
in having a great time with jazz music

69
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,100
and music that swings.

70
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,639
You should make
the audience want to dance although you

71
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,860
shouldn't be a circus act.

72
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,470
I think people
should focus on the music

73
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,140
and not the conductor

74
00:04:32,340 --> 00:00:00,000
you
