THROUGH SEALED COURT FILINGS. 
THESE PETITIONERS AND FOR A 
TIME SOME OF THE DIOCESE SOUGHT 
TO PREVENT THE ENTIRE REPORT 
FROM EVER SEEING THE LIGHT OF 
DAY. 
IN EFFECT, THEY WANT TO COVER 
UP THE COVER UP. 
THEY SOUGHT TO DO THE SAME 
THING THAT SENIOR CHURCH 
LEADERS IN THE DIOCESE THAT WE 
INVESTIGATED HAVE DONE FOR 
DECADES. 
BURIED THE SEXUAL ABUSE BY 
PRIESTS UPON CHILDREN AND COVER 
IT UP FOREVER. 
SHAMEFUL. 
THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE THE 
COURAGE TO TELL THE PUBLIC WHO 
THEY ARE. 
MOMENTS AGO A 884 PAGE REPORT 
ISSUED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE 40th 
STATEWIDE INVESTIGATIVE GRAND 
JURY, THE LARGEST, MOST 
COMPREHENSIVE REPORTS INTO 
CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE WITHIN THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH EVER PRODUCED 
IN THE UNITED STATES. 
IT WAS RELEASED. 
IT BUILDS ON THE BOSTON GLOBE'S 
SPOTLIGHT REPORT WHICH 
IDENTIFIED 229 ABUSER PRIEST. 
THE 2005 PHILADELPHIA GRAND 
JURY REPORTS INTO THE ARCH 
DIOCESE WHICH IDENTIFIED OVER 
60 ABUSER PRIEST, AND THE 2016 
ALTOONA JOHNSTOWN INVESTIGATION 
CONDUCTED BY THE OFFICE OF 
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHICH NAMED AT 
LEAST 50 ABUSER PRIEST. 
THE REPORT PUBLISHED TODAY IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH A JULY 27 
PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT ORDER
HAS SOME REDUCTIONS. 
LET ME BE VERY CLEAR, MY OFFICE 
IS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE 
RELEASE OF A REDACTED REPORT. 
EVERY REDACTION REPRESENTS AN 
INCOMPLETE STORY OF ABUSE THAT 
 
ORAL ARGUMENT SCHEDULED IN 
FRONT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA 
SUPREME COURT FOR SEPTEMBER 26. 
YOU CAN BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL 
FIGHT VIGOROUSLY TO REMOVE 
EVERY REDACTION AND TELL EVERY 
STORY OF ABUSE AND EXPOSE EVERY 
COVER UP. 
WHILE THOSE REDACTION'S 
REPRESENT A VERY SMALL FRACTION 
OF THE PREDATOR PRIEST NAMED BY 
THIS GRAND JURY, NO STORY OF 
ABUSE IS ANY LESS IMPORTANT 
THAN ANY OTHER. 
TODAY, PENNSYLVANIANS CAN LEARN 
THE EXTENT OF SEXUAL ABUSE IN 
THESE DIOCESE. 
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE CAN 
BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE 
SYSTEMATIC COVER-UP BY CHURCH 
LEADERS THAT FOLLOWED. 
AS MEMBERS OF THE GRAND JURY 
WROTE IN THEIR REPORT, WE NEED 
YOU TO HEAR THIS. 
THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER REPORTS 
ABOUT CHILD SEX ABUSE WITHIN 
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BUT NEVER 
ON THIS SCALE. 
FOR MANY OF US THOSE EARLIER 
STORIES HAPPENED SOMEPLACE ELSE
, NOW WE KNOW THE TRUTH. 
IT HAPPENED EVERYWHERE. 
THIS LENGTHY REPORT WAS WRITTEN 
BY 23 COMMITTED GRAND JURORS 
BASED ON EXTENSIVE TESTIMONY 
AND DOCUMENTATION. 
IT GOES INTO GREAT DETAIL ABOUT 
WIDESPREAD SEXUAL ABUSE AND 
COVER UP WITH IN THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH. 
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR 
PATIENCE AS I WALK YOU THROUGH 
THE CONTENTS OF THIS REPORT. 
AND WHILE I WILL ENDEAVOR TO 
GIVE A FULL ACCOUNTING OF THE 
REPORT, SO THAT YOU GET A FULL 
PICTURE OF WHAT TRANSPIRED IN 
THE SHADOWS OVER DECADES, 
NTHING I CAN SAY AND THE TIME 
WE HAVE TOGETHER TODAY WILL DO 
FULL JUSTICE TO THE TWO YEARS 
OF WORK DONE BY THE GRAND 
JURORS. 
I ASK THAT YOU TAKE THE TIME TO 
READ THE REPORT. 
THIS PAINFUL BODY OF FACTS AND 
DOCUMENTS CONTAINED IN IT WHICH 
IS NOW POSTED ON THE OFFICE OF 
ATTORNEY GENERAL WEBSITE. 
NOW I WILL LAY OUT THE 
FOLLOWING, THE UNPRECEDENTED 
SCOPE OF THIS INVESTIGATION, 
THE ABUSE, DIOCESE BY DIOCESE, 
CHARGES RESULTING FROM THE 
GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION. 
THE SYSTEMATIC COVER MAP -- 
COVER-UP BY CHURCH LEADERS, THE 
WEAPONIZATION OF FAITH, THE 
FAILURE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
FINALLY THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF 
THE GRAND JURY. 
THE GRAND JURY INVESTIGATED SIX 
DIOCESE ALLENTOWN, HARRISBURG, 
PITTSBURGH, GREENSBURG, ERIE, 
AND SCRANTON. 
THEIR WORK BUILT ON PREVIOUS 
GRAND JURY INVESTIGATIONS INTO 
THE DIOCESE OF PHILADELPHIA AND 
ALTOONA JOHNSTOWN AND IT PAINTS 
A COMPLETE PICTURE OF ABUSE AND 
COVER. 
THE GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION 
BEGAN TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE WE 
REALIZED DURING THE ALTOONA 
JOHNSTOWN INVESTIGATION THAT 
THE ABUSE AND COVER UP WAS NOT 
JUST LIMITED TO THAT REGION, IT 
WAS PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT THE 
ENTIRE COMMONWEALTH OF 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
DOZENS OF WITNESSES TESTIFIED 
BEFORE THE GRAND JURY, 
DETAILING ACTS OF SEXUAL ABUSE 
BY PRIESTS AND HOW SENIOR 
CHURCH OFFICIALS COVERED UP THE 
CRIMINAL CONDUCT, PRIORITIZING 
THEIR INSTITUTION OVER THE 
SAFETY AND THE WELFARE OF THE 
YOUNG BOYS AND GIRLS. 
THE GRAND JURY SUBPOENAED AND 
REVIEWED HALF 1 MILLION PAGES 
OF DOCUMENTS, INTERNAL CHURCH 
DOCUMENTS AND OFFICIAL RECORDS. 
THE ABUSE SCARRED EVERY DIOCESE,
THE COVER-UP WAS SOPHISTICATED. 
ALL THE WHILE CHURCH LEADERSHIP 
KEPT RECORDS OF THE ABUSE AND 
THE COVER-UP. 
THESE DOCUMENTS, FROM THE 
DIOCESE OWN SECRET ARCHIVES 
FORMED THE BACKBONE OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION, COOPERATING 
ACCOUNTS OF VICTIMS AND 
ILLUSTRATING THE ORGANIZED 
COVER-UP BY SENIOR CHURCH 
OFFICIALS THAT STRETCHED, IN 
SOME CASES, ALL THE WAY TO THE 
VATICAN. 
THE TERM SECRET ARCHIVES IS NOT 
MY TERM, IT IS HOW THE CHURCH 
OFFICIALS THEMSELVES REFER TO 
THE TROVES OF DOCUMENTS SITTING 
IN FILING CABINETS, JUST FEET 
FROM THE BISHOPS DESKS. 
IN EACH DIOCESE, THE BISHOPS 
HAD THE KEY TO THE SECRET 
ARCHIVES WHICH CONTAINED BOTH 
ALLEGATIONS AND ADMISSIONS OF 
THE ABUSE AND THE COVER-UP. 
THE GRAND JURY UNCOVER CREDIBLE 
EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL ABUSE AGAINST
301 PREDATOR PRIEST. 
AS SHOCKING AS THAT NUMBER IS, 
THE GRAND JURY REPORT NOTES 
THAT THE JURORS DID NOT 
AUTOMATICALLY NAME EVERY PRIEST 
MENTIONED IN THE DOCUMENTS IN 
THE SECRET ARCHIVES. 
THEY ACTUALLY RECEIVED FILES ON 
MORE THAN 400 PRIESTS. 
THEY WERE CAREFUL NOT TO NAME 
NAMES IF THE INFORMATION WAS 
TOO SCANTY TO MAKE A REASONABLE 
DETERMINATION ABOUT WHAT HAD 
HAPPENED. 
OVER 1000 CHILD VICTIMS WERE 
IDENTIFIED BY OUR INVESTIGATION.
THE GRAND JURY NOTES THAT THEY 
BELIEVE THAT NUMBER WAS IN THE 
THOUSANDS. AS THE REPORT READS, 
WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WHILE 
THE LIST OF PRIEST IS LONG, WE 
DO NOT THINK WE GOT THEM ALL. 
WE FEEL CERTAIN THAT MANY 
VICTIMS NEVER CAME FORWARD AND 
THAT THE DIOCESE DID NOT CREATE 
WRITTEN RECORDS EVERY SINGLE 
TIME THEY HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT 
ABUSE, THE GRAND JURORS WROTE. 
AS I DETAILED THE GRAND JURY 
FINDINGS, I WILL USE GRAPHIC 
LANGUAGE FROM THE REPORT THAT 
MAY MAKE SOME UNCOMFORTABLE, 
THESE WORDS ARE THE ONLY WAY TO 
ADEQUATELY EXPLAIN THE SEXUAL 
ABUSE COMMITTED BY PRIESTS UPON 
CHILDREN. 
THIS IS NOT TO BE SALACIOUS, IT 
IS TO SHARE THE TRUTH, TO KEEP 
A PROMISE THAT I MADE TO THE 
VICTIMS THAT I WOULD, IN THEIR 
WORDS, TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS 
ABUSE ACTUALLY WAS AND NOT RELY 
ON THE EUPHEMISMS THAT CHURCH 
OFFICIALS USED FOR DECADES TO 
COVER IT UP. 
CHURCH OFFICIALS ROUTINELY AND 
PURPOSELY DESCRIBED THE ABUSE 
AS HORSEPLAY AND WRESTLING AND 
INAPPROPRIATE CONTACT. 
IT WAS NONE OF THOSE THINGS. 
IT WAS CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE, 
INCLUDING RAPE COMMITTED BY 
GROWN MEN, PRIESTS AGAINST 
CHILDREN. ABOVE ALL ELSE, THEY 
PROTECTED THEIR INSTITUTION AT 
ALL COST. 
AS THE GRAND JURY FOUND, THE 
CHURCH SHOWED A COMPLETE DISDAIN
FOR VICTIMS. 
IN THE DIOCESE OF ERIE THE 
GRAND JURY NAMED 41 PRIEST WHO 
SEXUALLY ABUSE CHILDREN. 
ONE PRIEST IN ERIE, FATHER 
CHESTER GAWRONSKI FOLLOWED BOYS 
AND TOLD THEM HE WAS DOING TO 
-- SO TO PERFORM A CANCER 
CHECK. 
IN 1987 AFTER COMPLAINTS WERE 
ILED AGAINST HIM, HE PROVIDED 
THE DIOCESE WITH A LIST OF 41 
POSSIBLE VICTIMS. 
HE CONFIRMED AT LEAST 12 
CHILDREN THAT HE PERFORMED A 
CANCER CHECK ON. 
HE FREELY CONFESSED TO MULTIPLE 
INSTANCES OF SEXUAL ABUSE. 
FROM 1987 UNTIL 2002, 15 YEARS, 
HE REMAINED IN ACTIVE MINISTRY 
AND REPEATEDLY WAS REASSIGNED 
TO NEW PARISHES. 
IN THE DIOCESE OF ALLENTOWN THE 
GRAND JURY NAMED 37 PRIEST WHO 
SEXUALLY ABUSE CHILDREN. 
PLEASE HELP ME, I SEXUALLY 
MOLESTED A BOY ONE PRIEST, 
MICHAEL LAWRENCE, ADMITTED TO 
MONSIGNOR ANTHONY MANN TONE. 
HE NOTED THE CONFESSION AND A 
HANDWRITTEN CONFIDENTIAL MEMO. 
EVEN AFTER THE ADMISSION BY THE 
PRIEST, THE DIOCESE ACTUALLY 
RULED, THIS EXPERIENCE WILL NOT 
NECESSARILY BE A HORRENDOUS 
TRAUMA FOR THE VICTIM AND ALL 
THE FAMILY NEEDED WAS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO VENTILATE. 
FATHER LAWRENCE, THE ADMITTED 
CHILD MOLESTER WAS LEFT IN 
MINISTRY FOR YEARS BY THREE 
DIFFERENT BISHOPS. 
THE DIOCESE OF GREENSBORO, THE 
GRAND JURY NAMED 20 PRIEST WHO 
SEXUALLY ABUSE CHILDREN. 
ONE PRIEST, FATHER RAYMOND 
LUCADO, IMPREGNATED A 17-YEAR-
OLD GIRL, FORCED ANOTHER PASTOR 
SIGNATURE ON THE MARRIAGE 
CERTIFICATE AND THEN DIVORCE 
THE GIRL SHORTLY AFTER SHE GAVE 
BIRTH. 
DESPITE HAVING SEX WITH A 
MINOR, FATHERING A CHILD, AND 
BEING A MINOR AND DIVORCED HE 
WAS ALLOWED TO RETAIN MINISTRY 
AND ANOTHER STATE TOOK THE 
PREDATOR HIDING HIM FROM 
JUSTICE. 
THE DIOCESE OF HARRISBURG, THE 
GRAND JURY NAMED 45 PRIEST WHO 
SEXUALLY ABUSE CHILDREN. 
ONE PRIEST, FATHER JOE PIECE 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED A BOY 
REPEATEDLY WHEN THE BOY WAS 
BETWEEN 13 AND 15. 
HE ADMITTED TO DIOCESE 
OFFICIALSTO FINDING THE VICTIM 
NAKED UPSTAIRS ONE TIME IN THE 
RECTORY BUT HE SAID IT WAS ALL 
HORSEPLAY AND NOTHING SEXUAL 
OCCURRED. 
AT THIS POINT WE ARE AT AN 
IMPASSE, ALLEGATIONS AND NO 
ADMISSION THE DIOCESE WROTE IN 
A SECRET MEMO BEFORE CYCLING 
THIS PREDATOR THROUGH CHURCH 
RUN TREATMENT AND ALLOWING HIM 
BACK INTO ACTIVE MINISTRY FOR 
SEVEN MORE YEARS. 
IN THE DIOCESE OF PITTSBURGH, 
THE GRAND JURY NAMED 99 PRIESTS 
WHO SEXUALLY ABUSED CHILDREN. 
A GROUP OF AT LEAST FOUR 
PREDATOR PRIEST IN PITTSBURGH 
GROOMED A VIOLENTLY SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED YOUNG BOYS. ONE BOY 
WAS FORCED TO STAND ON A BED IN 
A RECTORY, STRIPPED NAKED AND 
POSE AS CHRIST ON THE CROSS FOR 
THE PRIEST. 
THEY TOOK PHOTOS OF THEIR VICTIM
ADDING THEM TO A COLLECTION OF 
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY WHICH THEY 
PRODUCED AND SHARED ON CHURCH 
GROUNDS. 
TO MAKE IT EASIER TO TARGET 
THEIR VICTIMS, THE PRIEST GAVE 
THEIR FAVORITE BOYS GIFTS, GOLD 
CROSSES TO WEAR AS NECKLACES. 
THE CROSSES WERE MARKINGS ON 
WHICH BOYS HAD BEEN GROOMED FOR 
ABUSE. 
THE GRAND JURY SAW ONE OF THOSE 
GOLD CROSSES WHEN ONE OF THE 
VICTIMS OF THE PITTSBURGH 
PRIEST TESTIFIED. 
IN THE DIOCESE OF SCRANTON, THE 
GRAND JURY NAMED 59 PRIESTS WHO 
SEXUALLY ABUSED CHILDREN. 
THE DIOCESE PRIEST THOMAS -- 
RAPED A YOUNG GIRL, GOT HER 
PREGNANT, THAT PRIEST ARRANGED 
FOR AN ABORTION. 
BISHOP JAMES TIMLIN EXPRESSED 
HIS FEELINGS IN A LETTER HE 
WROTE, THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT 
TIME IN YOUR LIFE. I REALIZE 
HOW UPSET YOU ARE, I TO SHARE 
YOUR GRIEF. 
ACCEPT THE BISHOPS LETTER WAS 
NOT FOR THE GIRL, THE BISHOP 
WROTE THAT LETTER TO THE RAPIST.
JUST THESE FEW EXAMPLES OF 
THOSE CONTAINED IN THE REPORT 
DEMONSTRATE STARKLY SIMILAR 
CORRUPT AND UNCONSCIONABLE ABUSE
. THE PATTERN WAS ABUSED, DENIED
AND COVERED UP. 
IT NOT ONLY VICTIMIZE CHILDREN, 
IT SERVED A LEGAL PURPOSE, 
CHURCH OFFICIALS MANIPULATED 
THIS FOR THEIR ADVANTAGE. 
THE LONGER THEY COVERED IT UP,  
COULD PROSECUTE THE PREDATORS 
BECAUSE THE STATUTE OF 
LIMITATIONS WOULD RUN. 
AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE 
SYSTEMATIC COVER-UP BY SENIOR 
CHURCH OFFICIALS, ALMOST EVERY 
INSTANCE OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE 
WE FOUND IS TOO OLD TO BE 
PROSECUTED. 
BUT NOT EVERY INSTANCE. 
THE GRAND JURY ISSUED 
PRESENTMENT AND WE FILE CHARGES 
AGAINST A PRIEST IN GREENSBURG 
AND A PRIEST IN ERIE WHO 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED CHILDREN. 
IN GREENSBURG WE CHARGED FATHER 
JOHN SWEENEY WITH SEXUALLY 
ABUSING A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY. 
SWEENEY PLED GUILTY EARLIER 
THIS MONTH. 
HE IS NOW AN ADMITTED SEXUAL 
PREDATOR. 
IN ERIE WE CHARGED FATHER DAVID 
PAULSON WITH SEXUALLY ABUSING 
ONE BOY FOR EIGHT YEARS 
STARTING WHEN HE WAS EIGHT 
YEARS OLD. 
HE ACTUALLY MADE THE BOY GO TO 
CONFESSION TO ADMIT HIS SCENES 
-- SINCE. THE BISHOP AT THE TIME
KNEW ALL ABOUT THE ABUSE. 
AND COVERED IT UP. 
AS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUS 
GRAND JURY IN ALTOONA 
JOHNSTOWN, TO FRANCISCAN FRIARS 
ADMITTED THAT THEY ENDANGERED 
THE WELFARE OF MINORS COVERING 
UP SEXUAL ASSAULT BY A FELLOW 
FRYER. 
THIS GRAND JURY AND THE ONE 
THAT PRECEDED IT DID NOT JUST 
WRITE REPORTS, THEY RECOMMENDED 
CHARGES WHERE THEY LEGALLY COULD
AND WE FOLLOW THROUGH. 
WE ALL WISH MORE CHARGES COULD 
BE FILED, DUE TO THE CHURCHES 
MANIPULATION OF OUR WEEK LAWS 
IN PENNSYLVANIA, TOO MANY 
PREDATORS ARE OUT OF REACH. 
THE COVER-UP MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE 
TO ACHIEVE JUSTICE FOR THE 
VICTIMS. 
CHURCH LEADERS AND EVERY ONE OF 
THE SIX DIOCESE HANDLED 
COMPLAITS OF SEXUAL ABUSE THE 
SAME WAY FOR DECADES. 
BY COVERING IT UP. 
THE GRAND JURORS WROTE, ALL OF 
THE VICTIMS WERE BRUSHED ASIDE 
IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE BY 
CHURCH LEADERS WHO PREFERRED TO 
PROTECT THE ABUSERS AND THEIR 
INSTITUTION ABOVE ALL. 
PRIEST WERE RAPING LITTLE BOYS 
AND GIRLS AND THE MEN OF GOD 
WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM 
DID NOTHING, THEY HID IT ALL 
FOR DECADES. 
MONSIGNOR'S, AUXILIARY BISHOPS, 
BISHOPS, ARCHBISHOPS, CARDINALS 
HAVE MOSTLY BEEN PROTECTED, MANY
, INCLUDING SOME NAMED IN THIS 
PROGRAM -- REPORT, HAVE BEEN 
PROMOTED. 
FATHER -- IDENTIFIED IN THE 
REPORT IS NOW A BISHOP. 
BISHOP LAUREL IS NOW CARDINAL 
WORLD. 
FATHER ZOO PICK IS NO BISHOP 
ZOO PICK. PREDATOR PRIESTS WERE 
ALLOWED TOREMAIN IN MINISTRY 
FOR 10, 20, 40 YEARS AFTER 
CHURCH LEADERS LEARNED OF THEIR 
CRIMES. 
IN THOSE YEARS THOSE LIST THE 
VICTIMS GOT LONGER AND LONGER. 
THERE ARE TOO MANY EXAMPLES OF 
THE COVER-UP TO SHARE RIGHT 
NOW. 
ALL ARE DOCUMENTED IN THE GRAND 
JURY REPORT. 
LET ME SHARE TWO EXAMPLES THAT 
SHOW THE LINKS TO WHICH THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH WOULD GO TO 
COVER IT UP. 
THE FIRST CASE IS AN EXAMPLE OF 
A CORRUPT BISHOP PUTTING THE 
INSTITUTION AHEAD OF ITS FOX 
WELL-BEING AND REPEATEDLY LYING 
ABOUT IT. 
THE DIOCESE OF ERIE NEW FATHER 
WILLIAM PRESLEY WAS SEXUALLY 
ABUSING AT LEAST TWO MINORS AS 
EARLY AS 1987. 
INSTEAD OF REPORTING IT TO 
POLICE, OFFICIALS HELD MEETINGS 
WITH PRESLEY TO REVIEW THE 
COMPLAINTS. 
THEY NOTED HE NEVER DENIED THE 
ALLEGATIONS, DESPITE THAT THEY 
CONCLUDED THAT THE VICTIMS WERE 
TROUBLED AND HAD PSYCHOLOGICAL 
PROBLEMS. 
THE DIOCESE CHOSE TO SEND 
PRESLEY FOR EVALUATION BY A 
DOCTOR AND THEN PLACED HIM 
RIGHT BACK IN MINISTRY. 
AFTER THE CHILD SEX ABUSE GAMBLE
ERUPTED IN THE BOSTON 
ARCHDIOCESE IN 2002, THREE 
SEPARATE VICTIMS NOTIFIED 
BISHOP TROUTMAN OF THEIR ABUSE 
AT THE HANDS OF PRESLEY WHICH 
WAS DETAILED IN THE REPORT. 
TROUTMAN SPOKE WITH PRESLEY WHO 
ADMITTED THE ABUSE THEN, 15 
YEARS AFTER THE ERIE DIOCESE 
FIRST LEARNED THAT HE WAS A 
PREDATOR, THE BISHOP FINALLY 
REVOKED PRESLEY'S PRIESTLY 
FACULTIES. 
AFTER PRESLEY'S REMOVAL, 
RESPONDING TO PRESS INQUIRIES 
ABOUT PRESLEY, THE DIOCESE 
ISSUED A COMMENT SAYING THEY 
KNEW OF ONLY ONE ABUSE 
ALLEGATION AND HAD QUOTE, NO 
INFORMATION TO PROVIDE ON OTHER 
POSSIBLE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST 
PRESLEY. 
THE DIOCESE LIED. 
BISHOP TROUTMAN HAD PERSONAL 
KNOWLEDGE OF AT LEAST THREE 
VICTIMS WHO HAD REPORTED THEIR 
ABUSE TO HIM. 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE ENTITY THAT 
BISHOP TROUTMAN APPARENTLY WAS 
HONEST WITH, THE VATICAN. 
THE BISHOP PRIVATELY DETAILED 
THE ABUSE TO VATICAN OFFICIALS 
IN 2003. 
WRITING IT QUOTE, CONFIRMS MY 
SUSPICION THAT THERE ARE MORE 
VICTIMS OF THE SEXUAL ABUSE AND 
EXULTATION PERPETRATED BY --. 
THE DIOCESE AND TROUTMAN WERE 
TELLING THE PUBLIC AND THE 
FAITHFUL ONE THING WHILE THEY 
WERE TELLING THE VATICAN AN 
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STORY. 
YEARS LATER IN 2006, TROUTMAN 
FINALLY CHOSE TO REPORT PRESLEY 
 
FALSELY TELLING PROSECUTORS 
THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS ONLY 
CAME TO LIGHT A FEW YEARS AGO. 
THE GRAND JURY FOUND THIS REPORT
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS ANOTHER 
LIE. 
THE TRUTH IS TROUTMAN AND THE 
DIOCESE OF ERIE INTENTIONALLY 
WAITED OUT THE STATUTE OF 
LIMITATIONS AND CURBED THEIR 
OWN INVESTIGATION TO AVOID 
FINDING ADDITIONAL VICTIMS. 
THE NEXT CASE HIGHLIGHTS THE 
HORRENDOUS ABUSE PERPETRATED BY 
ONE ABUSER PRIEST ON AN ENTIRE 
FAMILY. 
THE DIOCESE DISREGARD BY DOING 
NOTHING TO INVESTIGATE THE 
ABUSE FOR YEARS DESPITE KNOWING 
CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST 
THE PRIEST. 
OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD, THE 
PRIEST, GUS G ELLA SEXUALLY 
ABUSED FIVE SISTERS FROM THE 
SAME FAMILY. 
THE FAMILY OF NINE SIBLINGS WAS 
VERY INVOLVED WITH THE CHURCH. 
HE MET HIS VICTIMS WHEN THE 
GIRLS CAME TO THE RECTORY TO 
HELP COUNT COLLECTIONS. 
HE BEGAN SEXUALLY ABUSING ONE 
OF THE SISTERS, CAROLINE. 
SHE WAS JUST 18 MONTHS OLD. IS 
ABUSE CONTINUED UNTIL SHE WAS 
12. 
YOU SOUGHT CAROLYN EARLIER IN 
THAT POWERFUL VIDEO. 
IN 1987, A TEACHER AT McDEVITT 
HIGH SCHOOL REPORTED TO THE 
PRINCIPLE THAT GILLA WAS 
WATCHING A YOUNG GIRL AS SHE 
USED THE BATHROOM.  
THE PRINCIPAL REPORTED IT TO 
THE DIOCESE AND IT WAS NOTED IN 
THE SECRET ARCHIVE ALONG WITH 
INFORMATION THAT HE WAS 
ENGAGING IN SIMILAR CONDUCT 
WITH ONE OF THE FIVE SISTERS 
FROM THE SAME FAMILY. 
A MEMORANDUM IN THE CHURCH A 
SECRET ARCHIVE ABOUT HIS ABUSE 
INCLUDED THE HIGH SCHOOL 
PRINCIPAL WAS INSTRUCTED TO DO 
NOTHING IN THE CASE UNTIL THE 
MATTER HAD BEEN DISCUSSED WITH 
THE LEGAL COUNSEL. 
OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, THE 
DIOCESE TO NO ACTION TO REMOVE 
GILLA FOR MINISTRY. 
CHOSE NOT TO INFORM LAW 
ENFORCEMENT , THE FAMILY, OR 
PARISHIONERS. 
INSTEAD THEY CHOSE TO KNOWINGLY 
ALLOW HIM TO CONTINUE TO 
SEXUALLY ABUSE THESE GIRLS. 
IN 1992, THE YOUNGEST VICTIM OF 
THE FAMILY TOLD HER PARENTS 
WHAT GILLA HAD BEEN DOING.  
THE FAMILY REPORTED THE CONDUCT 
TO THE DIOCESE AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
POLICE SERVED A SEARCH WARRANT 
ON HIS HOME AND CONFISCATED A 
YOUNG GIRLS PANTIES, PLASTIC 
CONTAINERS WITH PUBIC HAIRS 
IDENTIFIED BY INITIALS, VIALS 
OF URINE AND PHOTOS OF GIRLS IN 
SEXUALLY EXPLICIT POSITIONS. 
HE WAS ARRESTED IN 1992. 
MORE THAN A DECADE AFTER HE 
STARTED ABUSING CHILDREN. 
HE NEVER FACED THE JURY FOR HIS 
CRIMES. 
úHE DIED AWAITING TRIAL 
THE MOTHER OF THE GIRLS ABUSE BY
GILLIA TESTIFIED BEFORE THE 
GRAND JURY. 
SHE SAID SHE CONFRONTED CHURCH 
OFFICIALS,  MONSIGNOR -- WHEN 
SHE LEARNED OF HIS YEARS OF 
ABUSING HER DAUGHTER'S. 
IN RESPONSE SHE SAID THE 
MONSIGNOR TOLD HER, I WONDERED 
WHY YOU WERE LETTING THEM GO TO 
THE RECTORY. 
THE GRAND JURY CONCLUDED THAT 
THE TRAGIC ABUSE OF THESE GIRLS 
COULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED MUCH 
EARLIER IF THE DIOCESE OF 
HARRISBURG HAD ACTED ON THE 
ORIGINAL COMPLAINT. 
THE FAMILY OF THE SISTERS ABUSE 
BY THIS PREDATOR HAVE NEVER 
BEEN ABLE TO TELL THEIR STORY 
UNTIL TODAY. 
THEY WERE GAGGED FROM SPEAKING 
BY A CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT 
INSISTED UPON BY THE DIOCESE IN 
EXCHANGE FOR SETTLING THEIR 
CLAIMS AGAINST THE CHURCH. 
INSTEAD OF HELPING THESE GIRLS 
HEAL, THEY PAID FOR THEIR 
SILENCE. 
THESE WOMEN NO LONGER NEED TO 
BE SILENCE. 
TODAY THE GRAND JURY FINALLY 
GIVES HIS FAMILY A VIC -- OF 
VICTIMS THEIR VOICE. 
PREDATORS AND EVERY DIOCESE 
WEAPONIZED THE CATHOLIC FAITH 
AND USED IT AS A TOOL OF THEIR 
ABUSE. 
FATHER WILLIAM PRESLEY GAVE 
VOICE SEDATIVES TO RELAX THE 
BEFORE HIS ABUSE AND AND TOLD 
THE IT WAS OKAY BECAUSE HE WAS 
A PRIEST. 
FATHER EDMUND -- TOLD ALTAR 
BOYS NOT TO WEAR CLOTHING 
UNDERNEATH THEIR -- BECAUSE GOD 
DIDN'T WANT CLOTHING ON THE 
SKIN. 
FATHER -- GROOMED HIS STUDENTS 
FOR ORAL SECTS BY TELLING THEM 
HOW MARY HAD TO LEAK JESUS 
CLEAN WHEN HE WAS BORN. 
FATHER AUTHOR YOUNG TOLD HIS 
VICTIM AS HE PRESSURED HER TO 
HAVE SEX, GOD WANTS US TO 
EXPRESS OUR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER 
IN THIS WAY. 
FATHER GRAFF TOLD -- THAT WHAT 
THEY WERE DOING WAS OKAY BECAUSE
A PRIEST WAS AN INSTRUMENT OF 
GOD. 
MONSIGNOR THOMAS -- MADE AN 
NINE-YEAR-OLD GIVE ORAL SEX AND 
THEN RINSE HIS MOUTH OUT WITH 
HOLY WATER TO PURIFY HIM. 
THESE CHILDREN, CHILDREN, 
SURROUNDED BY ADULTS ENABLING 
THEIR ABUSE WERE TAUGHT THAT 
THIS ABUSE WAS NOT ONLY NORMAL, 
BUT THAT IT WAS WHOLLY. 
THE CHURCH WAS NOT THE ONLY 
INSTITUTION THAT FAILED 
CHILDREN. 
THE GRAND JURY FOUND SEVERAL 
INSTANCES WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
LET THEM DOWN. 
HERE IS ONE EXAMPLE. 
IN THE DIOCESE OF PITTSBURGH, 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY ROBERT 
MASTERS OF BEAVER COUNTY 
REPORTED TO CHURCH LEADERSHIP 
CONCERN ABOUT AN ABUSE 
INVESTIGATION INVOLVING ONE 
PRIEST. 
THAT QUOTE, IN ORDER TO PREVENT 
UNFAVORABLE PUBLICITY HE HALTED 
ALL INVESTIGATION INTO 
INCIDENTS INVOLVING OTHER YOUNG 
BOYS. 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY MASTERS 
ACTUALLY TESTIFIED TO THE GRAND 
JURY THAT HIS REASON FOR 
FAILING TO INVESTIGATE AND 
PROSECUTE THE SEXUAL ABUSE CASE 
AGAINST A PRIEST WAS THAT HE 
WANTED THE DIOCESE SUPPORT FOR 
HIS POLITICAL CAREER. 
I HAVE DESCRIBED FOR YOU ONLY 
SOME OF THE ABUSE AND EXTENSIVE 
COVER-UP. 
THE FINDINGS IN THIS REPORT 
WOULD BE INCOMPLETE WITHOUT 
DISCUSSING HOW THIS ABUSE HAS 
AFFECTED SURVIVORS YEARS AFTER 
THE ABUSE ENDED. 
CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE IS 
TRAUMATIZING. IN THESE CASES 
THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF 
TRAUMA BECAUSE THE ABUSE CAME 
AT THE HANDS OF THEIR SPIRITUAL 
LEADERS. 
INSTEAD OF HEALING, VICTIMS 
WERE SHAMED, THEY WERE RIDICULED
, WHEN THESE CHILDREN TOLD 
AUTHORITY FIGURES OF THEIR 
ABUSE THEIR ACCOUNTS WERE 
QUESTIONED AND HUSHED AND 
SHUNNED. 
WHEN A YOUNG BOY RAN INTO A 
POLICE STATION IN SCRANTON 
AFTER HIS POLICE ATTEMPT -- 
PRIEST ATTEMPTED TO ASSAULT HIM 
HE TOLD THE MAN ON DUTY I DON'T 
WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
THIS I JUST WANT YOU TO GET OUT 
OF HERE. 
WHEN ONE VICTIM IN ALLENTOWN 
TOLD A PRIEST OF HER ABUSE HE 
SAID TO HER, I DON'T WANT TO 
HEAR IT, YOU GO TO CONFESSION 
AND YOU PRAY FOR HIM. 
WHEN ANOTHER VICTIM OF THE SAME 
ABUSER PRIEST TRY TO TELL 
ANOTHER CLERGYMAN, THAT 
CLERGYMAN SAID DON'T SAY THE 
NAME. FOR THE RECORD, THE NAME 
IS FATHER FRANCIS --. 
ONE VICTIM, DESPITE BEING 
INSULTED BY A MONSIGNOR FELT SO 
STRONGLY ABOUT HIS FAITH THAT 
HE HIMSELF BECAME A PRIEST. 
AFTER FEELING CHURCH'S APPEARS 
CONTINUE TO IGNORE SEXUAL ABUSE 
HE LEFT HIS CALLING AND HE NOW 
ADVOCATES FOR SURVIVORS. 
THE IMPACT ESPECIALLY WHEN KEPT 
SECRET LAST A LIFETIME. 
THE TIME OF TELLING THESE 
VICTIMS TO KEEP THEIR TRUTH TO 
THEMSELVES HAS ENDED. UNLIKE 
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND SOME IN 
LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE HEAR YOU 
AND WE BELIEVE YOUR TRUTH. 
I WANT TO THANK THE MANY VICTIM 
SUPPORT GROUPS INCLUDING THE 
PENNSYLVANIA OFFICE OF VICTIM 
ADVOCATE FOR THE WORK THAT THEY 
DO EVERY SINGLE DAY TO SUPPORT 
SURVIVORS AND THEIR ASSISTANCE 
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. 
SEVERAL DOZEN SURVIVORS ARE 
HERE WITH US TODAY, EACH WITH A 
STORY OF LIFELONG IMPACT FROM 
THEIR ABUSE. 
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ONE OF 
THEM WHOSE STORY IS SADLY NOT 
UNIQUE. 
JOEY BEHE. JOEY WAS A SEVEN-
YEAR-OLD BOY FROM THE DIOCESE 
OF ALLENTOWN. 
HE WAS REPEATEDLY RAPED BY 
FATHER EDWARD GRAFF, A PRIEST 
WHO ACCORDING TO THE GRAND JURY 
RAPED SCORES OF CHILDREN OVER 
35 YEARS. 
FATHER GRAFF WAS A PHYSICALLY 
IMPOSING MAN AND A ALCOHOLIC. 
WHEN HE ATTACKED JOEY HE BORE 
DOWN ON HIS BACK WITH SUCH 
FORCE THAT JOEY SPINE WAS 
SEVERELY DAMAGED. JOY RECEIVED 
TREATMENT FOR THE BACK INJURY 
AND EVENTUALLY BECAME ADDICTED 
TO PAINKILLERS THAT THE DOCTORS 
HAD PRESCRIBED. 
HE ULTIMATELY OVERDOSED AND 
DIED. 
BEFORE HE DIED HE WROTE TO THE 
DIOCESE OF ALLENTOWN, FATHER 
GRAFF DID MORE THAN RAPE ME, HE 
KILLED MY POTENTIAL. 
IN DOING SO HE KILLED THE MAN 
THAT I SHOULD HAVE BECOME. 
JOEY'S MOM JUDY IS HERE TODAY. 
SHE TESTIFIED BEFORE THE GRAND 
JURY. 
SHE SAID THAT THEY NEVER 
ADMITTED TO ANYTHING HAPPENING. 
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO 
PROVE HIS ENTIRE LIFE WHAT HAD 
HAPPENED AND HE WAS TELLING THE 
TRUTH, THEY NEVER ADMITTED, 
THEY NEVER SAID THERE WAS ABUSE
. I PROMISED JOEY'S MOM THAT WE 
WOULD NOT FORGET JOEY. 
THE ABUSE DID HAPPEN. 
THE GRAND JURORS BELIEVED JOEY. 
JOEY'S TRAUMA LED TO HIS DEATH. 
FOR THOUSANDS OF OTHER VICTIMS 
TRAUMA MANIFESTS ITSELF IN MANY 
WAYS. 
SOME ARE LEFT WITH SPEECH 
PROBLEMS, UNCONTROLLABLE 
STUTTERING, MANY TURN TO 
ALCOHOL AND DRUGS TO ESCAPE THE 
MEMORY OF THEIR ABUSE. 
SOME WERE UNABLE TO HAVE NORMAL 
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS OR HAVE 
CHILDREN OR SHOW PHYSICAL 
AFFECTION TO THOSE THEY LOVE. 
YOU HEARD BOB AND SEAN SPEAK 
ABOUT THAT IN THE VIDEO 
EARLIER. 
MANY ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. SADLY, 
MANY WERE SUCCESSFUL. 
DURING THE GRAND JURY'S 
DELIBERATIONS, ONE VICTIM WHO 
TESTIFIED BEFORE THE GRAND JURY 
TRIED TO KILL HERSELF. 
FROM HER HOSPITAL BED SHE ASKED 
FOR ONE THING, THAT WE FINISH 
OUR WORK AND TELL THE WORLD 
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. 
FOR MANY OF THE VICTIMS THIS 
GRAND JURY REPORT IS JUSTICE. 
THE GRAND JURORS FELT A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO EXPOSE THE 
ABUSE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS 
TO ENSURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. 
IN THEIR WORDS, WE ARE GOING TO 
SHINE A LIGHT ON THEIR CONDUCT 
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE 
VICTIMS DESERVE. 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW THE LAW 
CAN CHANGE SO THAT NO ONE WOULD 
HAVE TO CONDUCT ANOTHER INQUIRY 
LIKE THIS ONE. 
WE EXERCISE OUR HISTORIC AND 
STATUTORY RIGHT AS GRAND JURORS 
TO INFORM THE PUBLIC OF OUR 
FINDINGS. 
THE REPORT CONTINUES, WE CANNOT 
CHARGE MOST OF THE CULPRITS, 
WHAT WE CAN DO IS TELL OUR 
FELLOW CITIZENS WHAT HAPPENED 
AND TRY TO GET SOMETHING DONE 
ABOUT IT. 
HERE ARE THE FORMS THAT THE -- 
THAT THE GRAND JURY RECOMMENDS 
TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING 
AGAIN. 
FIRST, ELIMINATE THE CRIMINAL 
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR 
SEXUALLY ABUSING CHILDREN. 
CHILD SEXUAL PREDATORS SHOULD 
NO LONGER BE ABLE TO HIDE 
BEHIND A CRIMINAL STATUTE OF 
LIMITATIONS. 
THANKS TO A RECENT AMENDMENT 
THE CURRENT LAW PERMITS VICTIMS 
TO COME FORWARD UNTIL AGE 50. 
THAT IS BETTER THAN IT WAS 
BEFORE, BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH 
ACCORDING TO THE GRAND JURY 
GIVEN THE PHYSICAL AND 
EMOTIONAL TRAUMA THAT SEXUAL 
ABUSE VICTIMS UNDERGO, IT IS 
WELL DOCUMENTED THAT THE 
PROCESS OF TELLING SOMEONE 
ABOUT THE ABUSE CAN TAKE YEARS 
OR DECADES. 
JUSTICE FOR THESE VICTIMS 
SHOULD NOT BE DENIED. 
PENNSYLVANIA LAWMAKERS SHOULD 
SEND A's -- A CLEAR MESSAGE AND 
EMPOWER LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AGENCIES TO HUNT DOWN ALL 
FUTURE CHILD PREDATORS NO 
MATTER HOW LONG THEY LIVE. 
SECOND, THE GRAND JURY URGES 
LAWMAKERS TO CREATE A CIVIL 
WINDOW IN PENNSYLVANIA SO THAT 
OLDER VICTIMS MAY NOW SUE FOR 
DAMAGES FOR WHEN THEIR BODIES 
WERE DEFILED AS CHILDREN. 
THE LAW GIVES CHILD SIX ABUSE 
VICTIMS TO SUE ONCE THEY TURN 
18. 
VICTIMS IN THE 30s OR OLDER 
FALL UNDER A DIFFERENT LAW, 
THEY ONLY GET TWO YEARS. 
FOR VICTIMS IN THIS AGE RANGE, 
THE WINDOW FOR THEM EXPIRED 
BACK IN THE 1990S, LONG BEFORE 
REVELATIONS ABOUT THE 
INSTITUTIONAL NATURE OF SEXUAL 
ABUSE WITHIN THE CHURCH. 
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. 
THE GRAND JURY PROPOSAL WOULD 
OPEN UP A LIMITED WINDOW 
OFFERING ABUSE SURVIVORS A 
CHANCE TO FINALLY BE HEARD IN 
COURT. 
ALL WE ARE ASKING IS TO GIVE 
VICTIMS THOSE TWO YEARS BACK 
THE JURAT -- GRAND JURORS WROTE.
I HAVE SPENT TIME WITH DOZENS 
OF VICTIMS, THOSE HERE TODAY 
AND THOSE ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA, 
NOT ONE HAS EVER EXPRESSED A 
DESIRE FOR COMPENSATION WHEN 
THEY CAME FORWARD AND SHARED 
THEIR TRUTH. 
THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO 
WITHOUT MEANS TO PAY FOR THE 
COUNSELING AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE 
TREATMENT AND OTHER ASSISTANCE 
THEY NEED TO FIGHT THE DEMONS 
INFLICTED UPON THEM BY THE 
CHURCH. 
SEVERAL OTHER STATES HAVE 
LEGALLY CREATED WINDOWS FOR 
VICTIMS TO SUE. 
THIS REPORT DEMONSTRATES THE 
NEED FOR THIS REFORM IN 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
>>> ABUSE AND COVER-UP, THAT IS 
HOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF 
PENNSYLVANIA IS DESCRIBING IT. 
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE LANDMARK 
MOMENT. 
AN INVESTIGATION WAS LAUNCHED 
LOOKING INTO THE SEXU
