French president is on course to take another campaign pledge off his left in manual macrons promising to bring back compulsory military service and his party's being busy trying to whip up support in Sonora we call it the national service because it's the place where the youth of our country and the nation meet one another where they get to know the military service on the one hand and civil engagement on the other it's where one gives his time to the nation and to society what about the age range it will cover all age ranges both boys and girls will take part and the service will be obligatory poles three years ago suggested that 80% of people were in favor of the move but now that's dwindled to a little more than half shallow Dubinski has been asking people in Paris what they think now are you ready to serve your country yes I have even tried to get in the army I think there are many ways to help your country and not only in the army it's not all about taking a weapon in your hands army training is definitely way stricter than the school curriculum but this experience gave me a new perspective on things well I think military service is something good this creates unity around the country but servant should be optional at the moment it all seems quite crazy first they say it with the obligatory then they say not do you know the French national anthem at all well despite all that French military expert Xavier Moreau told us he doesn't expect McCombs plan to work out my core is now paying one of his unrealistic proposals it did during his campaign we are talking about three six months is a conscription and it couldn't work because to teach the basic knowledge is to the basic skills to soldier it needs minimum three months it's impossible to make something useful for for a modern army like the French army where there is many high technical systems
