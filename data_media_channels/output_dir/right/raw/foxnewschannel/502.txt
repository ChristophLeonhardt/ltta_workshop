1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:08,973
>> Sean: IN TIME FOR MORE ON

2
00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:10,007
WHAT WE CALLED SELECTIVE MORAL

3
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:11,242
OUTRAGE ON THIS PROGRAM.

4
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:13,177
WE BRING IN JUANITA BRODERICK

5
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:15,012
TOLD THE STORY ABOUT

6
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:16,213
BILL CLINTON AND RATE BACK IN

7
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:17,014
THE 70s.

8
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:18,583
ALSO WITH US, THE AUTHOR OF THE

9
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,819
NUMBER ONE BEST SELLER,

10
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:22,253
GREGG JARRETT.

11
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:24,589
I DID THE SECOND INTERVIEW WITH

12
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,724
YOU, AND EVEN THROUGH THIS LAST

13
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:28,593
ELECTION, A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WE

14
00:00:28,593 --> 00:00:31,329
ARE HEARING FROM NOW, THEY WERE

15
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,630
SILENT.

16
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,599
THEY NEVER WANTED -- THEY DIDN'T

17
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,534
WANT AN FBI INVESTIGATION FOR

18
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:37,769
YOU THAT I REMEMBER.

19
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:41,506
>> OH, NO, SENATOR FEINSTEIN,

20
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:42,006
SENATOR DURBIN AND

21
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:42,907
SENATOR SCHUMER WANTED NOTHING

22
00:00:42,907 --> 00:00:45,209
TO DO WITH MY CASE.

23
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:47,812
ALL DEMOCRATS REFUSED TO READ MY

24
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:50,515
DEPOSITION WITH THE INDEPENDENT

25
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:50,848
COUNSEL.

26
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:51,683
>> Sean: THEY NEVER ONCE

27
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:53,217
REACHED OUT TO YOU?

28
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:54,152
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL THERE,

29
00:00:54,152 --> 00:00:57,789
THE ONES ACTING, YOU KNOW, THE

30
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:59,257
ONES THAT ARE SO SUPPORTIVE OF

31
00:00:59,257 --> 00:01:00,558
THE ALLEGATIONS?

32
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,796
>> NO THEY NEVER REACHED OUT TO

33
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:05,063
ME.

34
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:05,997
>> Sean: WHEN THIS HAPPENED TO

35
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:09,601
YOU, BECAUSE I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE

36
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:10,702
INTERVIEWED IT, IT WAS

37
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:11,536
30 MINUTES LATER YOU TOLD THE

38
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:15,273
WOMAN YOU ARE WITH AND YOUR LIP

39
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:16,407
WAS THREE TIMES ITS NORMAL SIZE?

40
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:18,142
>> RIGHT, AND BLEEDING.

41
00:01:18,142 --> 00:01:19,077
THE WOMAN CAME BACK TO THE ROOM

42
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:21,045
AND FOUND ME WHEN I DIDN'T SHOW

43
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:22,447
UP FOR THE SEMINAR AND OF

44
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:24,048
COURSE, I TOLD HER IMMEDIATELY,

45
00:01:24,048 --> 00:01:25,884
LOOK AT THE CONDITION I WAS IN.

46
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:28,253
MY CLOTHES WERE TORN, MY LIP WAS

47
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:31,523
HUGE, AND I WAS DEVASTATED.

48
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:34,259
>> Sean: AND AFRAID OF.

49
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,227
>> OH GOODNESS, YES.

50
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:37,629
>> Sean: AND NOBODY -- THE

51
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:39,631
DEMOCRATS, THE SAME PEOPLE THAT

52
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:42,233
WERE ACTING SO INDIGNANT,

53
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:42,567
NOTHING?

54
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:43,835
>> ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

55
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,136
>> Sean: GREGG JARRETT, FROM A

56
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,005
LEGAL STANDPOINT, THE FBI HAS

57
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:48,139
ALSO SAID THAT THIS IS NOT

58
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:51,009
WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION.

59
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,010
WE PLAYED JOE BIDEN.

60
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,212
THIS WAS A TALKING POINT FOR

61
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:55,780
DELAY TODAY, WASN'T IT?

62
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,015
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

63
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:59,784
BY LAW THE FBI IS NOT ALLOWED TO

64
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:00,819
INVESTIGATE A NONFEDERAL CRIME.

65
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,221
THEY CAN ONLY DO BACKGROUND

66
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:05,023
CHECKS, AND AS BIDEN POINTED

67
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:05,857
OUT, THEY SIMPLY TAKE WITNESS

68
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:08,860
STATEMENTS, THEY DON'T JUDGE

69
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,029
GUILT OR INNOCENCE OR THE

70
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:12,197
CREDIBILITY OF PARTICULAR

71
00:02:12,197 --> 00:02:12,798
WITNESSES.

72
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:14,066
SO IT WAS AN UTTER CANARD OVER

73
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:17,736
AND OVER AGAIN CALL FOR

74
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:20,405
CAVANAUGH TO ASK FOR AN FBI

75
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:21,573
INVESTIGATION.

76
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:23,008
>> Sean: JUANITA, YOU WERE

77
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:24,877
HERE TODAY AND EVEN DURING 2016,

78
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:27,813
YOU FELT COMPELLED TO SPEAK UP

79
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:28,614
ABOUT THE DOUBLE STANDARD.

80
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:30,415
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE

81
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:34,153
DEMOCRATS THAT, CLEARLY, THIS IS

82
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,320
ABOUT POLITICS AND NOT ABOUT

83
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,021
WHAT'S RIGHT?

84
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:42,194
>> WELL, I CLEARLY THINK IF

85
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:42,794
SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND

86
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:43,595
SENATOR DURBIN HAD KNOWN THAT I

87
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:46,832
WAS OUTSIDE, I THINK THEY SHOULD

88
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:47,833
HAVE WALKED OUT AND APOLOGIZE TO

89
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,802
ME FOR WHAT THEY DID TO ME IN

90
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:51,503
1999, COMPLETELY TURNING THEIR

91
00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:53,839
BACKS ON ME.

92
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,507
>> Sean: AND KATHLEEN AND

93
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:57,042
PAULA AND JENNIFER, WHO WAS

94
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,610
CALLED A LIAR.

95
00:02:58,610 --> 00:00:00,000
>> EXACTLY, YES.
