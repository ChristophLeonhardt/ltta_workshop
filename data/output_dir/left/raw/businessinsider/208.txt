1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,540
- [Announcer] Hooters Air
puts the fun back into flying.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,373
(record scratching)

3
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:04,206
- [Narrator] Wait a minute.

4
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:05,220
- [Announcer] Hooters
girls on every flight.

5
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,630
- [Narrator] Hooters had an airline?

6
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,570
- [Announcer] All leather
seats with extra leg room.

7
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,780
Call 1-888-FLY-HOOT.

8
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,640
- [Narrator] You might not
have known about Hooters Air

9
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,450
because it didn't last long.

10
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,630
- Fly Hooters Air!

11
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,463
- There you go.

12
00:00:17,463 --> 00:00:19,030
- [Narrator] It started in 2003,

13
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,290
and initially the airline was successful,

14
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,270
but it shut down just three years later.

15
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,180
- We're at the Gary Chicago
International Airport

16
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,390
where Hooters Air is about
to make their maiden flight

17
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,223
to Myrtle Beach.

18
00:00:29,223 --> 00:00:31,180
- [Narrator] Based in Myrtle
Beach, South Carolina,

19
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,560
it offered low-price direct flights

20
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,520
to more than 15 destinations in the U.S.

21
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,690
Air fares were a flat rate
of $129 dollars each way.

22
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,460
So why did Hooters
think it was a good idea

23
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,730
to start an airline, and why did it fail?

24
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,220
- If you like what you
see here on the outside,

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,950
you're gonna love what
you'll see on the inside.

26
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,160
- [Narrator] Hooters was
founded by six business men

27
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,670
in Clearwater, Florida in 1983.

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,580
A year later, an Atlanta-based
group led by Bob Brooks

29
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,319
saw the company's potential
and bought it outright.

30
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,940
- It was the first "breastaurant" chain.

31
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,800
So basically they pioneered the idea that

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,510
they're going to have all their
waiters where short shorts

33
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,740
and really tight tank tops.

34
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,600
- Do you know why our beer
is so cold here at Hooters?

35
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,650
Because we keep it in the refrigerator.

36
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,440
- From kind of the '80s
until the early 2000s

37
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,310
it was a very successful
kind of growing business.

38
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,290
- [Narrator] By 2003,
Hooters was flushed with cash

39
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,450
and Bob Brooks wanted to expand the brand,

40
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,740
so he bought a small North
Carolina-based charter airline

41
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,440
called Pace Airlines.

42
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,100
He repainted the airplanes
with the company logo

43
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,760
and Hooters Air took off.

44
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,360
- What would you tell people
out there watching the show

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,790
about flying Hooters Air?

46
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,770
- You should definitely do it.

47
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,160
It's an experience like no other.

48
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,720
- How about yourself?

49
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,624
- It's gonna be the most
exciting time of your life.

50
00:01:50,624 --> 00:01:52,410
- [Pilot] I'm probably one
of the few pilots who can say

51
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,928
I actually went to "pilot heaven."

52
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:54,761
- [Narrator] This is the voice

53
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:56,860
of a former Hooters Air pilot.

54
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,493
He asked to remain anonymous.

55
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,770
- There was a lot of
intrigue about this airline

56
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,280
not because of necessarily
what was going on on the inside

57
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,410
but more so what people
perceived from the outside.

58
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,750
- It's gonna be a nice
change from the restaurant.

59
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,480
Instead of serving food and all that stuff

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,890
and picking up trash, we get
to just basically entertain,

61
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,210
ask trivia questions and all that.

62
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,330
- [Narrator] A common
misconception about Hooters Air

63
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,000
was that the flight
attendants on the flights

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,370
were Hooters girls.

65
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,510
Not exactly.

66
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,290
In addition to the two
Hooters girls on every flight,

67
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,690
there were three FAA-certified
flight attendants.

68
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,060
- [Flight Attendant] The flight
attendants are the ones who

69
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,710
serve all the food and
the drinks, per usual.

70
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,550
I had a professional uniform.

71
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,440
I had like a navy blue dress.

72
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,480
You know, it was very professional.

73
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,610
It had the little owl
embroidered emblem on it.

74
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,610
- [Flight Attendant] We just
did the safety procedures

75
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,570
and stuff like that.

76
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,240
And then we had two Hooters girls

77
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,450
from different restaurants in the area

78
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,070
but they had no training whatsoever.

79
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,600
They were just there
just for passenger fun.

80
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,433
- What is it all gonna include?

81
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:57,810
You guys are gonna be up
there serving customers?

82
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,950
- No wings.
- No wings.

83
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,150
- But great food.
- But great food.

84
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,670
- Yeah, we got some soft pretzels

85
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,070
and we got some like pigs in a blanket

86
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,740
and you know, maybe some ...

87
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,230
fruit, you know.

88
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,864
- [Flight Attendant] The two Hooters girls

89
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:13,980
would get up during the
flight and do trivia

90
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,750
or little games or sing a song.

91
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,960
I think they just sat in
their seats the whole time

92
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,032
until it was their five minutes
to get up, and that was it.

93
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:24,030
The rest of the time us
flight attendants are working.

94
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,260
- [Interviewer] Were
there ever any incidents

95
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,040
that you witnessed of harassment

96
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,780
or customers getting a
little too inebriated?

97
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,560
- [Flight Attendant] I never
saw any kind of harassment.

98
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,330
There was definitely flirtiness.

99
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,830
Any flight, you're always
gonna come across some people

100
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,880
that have drank too much, but nothing bad.

101
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,926
It was fun, we did our job right.

102
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:42,710
It was just very happy memories.

103
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,090
- [Announcer] Fares from $99.

104
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,350
Convenient morning departures
and evening returns.

105
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,720
- [Narrator] Hooters Air
helped out smaller airports

106
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,390
like the one in Gary, Indiana,

107
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,820
just 25 miles southeast of Chicago.

108
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,210
- It's good news, more airline
service, more activity,

109
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,900
more economic development, more jobs,

110
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,620
more people spending money
in northwest Indiana and ...

111
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,453
- Good news.

112
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,040
- Southern Chicago, and so
it's very good news, yeah.

113
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,900
- [Narrator] And it was
a major economic boon

114
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,560
to one city in particular: Myrtle Beach.

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,305
- In its heyday Hooters Air
was bringing between 3,000

116
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:14,310
and 5,000 people a week
into the Myrtle Beach area.

117
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,910
Hooters Air was more than just an airline.

118
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,100
It was a huge philanthropic contribution

119
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,290
to the Myrtle Beach area by Mr. Brooks,

120
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,550
who had a vision that
the Myrtle beach area

121
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,590
could grow and expand and evolve

122
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,270
as a tourism destination
and a business community.

123
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,560
- [Narrator] Hooters Air
was big for Myrtle Beach

124
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,780
but it wasn't enough to keep it airborne,

125
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,690
so Hooters shut it down in
2006, citing a $40 million loss.

126
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,270
- It was compounded by
a couple of factors.

127
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,680
They started the airline
still as the airline industry

128
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,960
was recovering from the 9/11 attacks.

129
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,520
People were still scared
of getting on airplanes.

130
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,410
There was growing low-fare
competition in the market

131
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,710
as Southwest and other
airlines had begun to expand.

132
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,330
And jet fuel prices were trending upward.

133
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,760
So it just wasn't an
economically viable business.

134
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,810
- [Narrator] Hooters chairman
Bob Brooks passed away

135
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,470
in 2006, the same year
that Hooters Air shut down.

136
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,500
- There are people at
work and people enjoying

137
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,150
the Myrtle Beach area
that might never have had

138
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,820
the opportunity to do so if
it weren't for Bob Brooks,

139
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,360
so we remain very grateful
for his investment

140
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,010
in his airline and our community.

141
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,290
- [Narrator] Despite the
failure of Hooters Air,

142
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,150
the Hooters brand continue to thrive.

143
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,520
- They've opened hundreds
of locations in the U.S.

144
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,650
and outside of the U.S.

145
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,190
They are more than a
$250 million business,

146
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,290
basically, at this point, and they kind of

147
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,020
took over the U.S. and then the world.

148
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,920
- [Pilot] Often times, going into cities,

149
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,330
we'd be on an approach and

150
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,640
we'd hear the air traffic controller say,

151
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,980
"Do you have the Hooters
airplane in sight?

152
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,750
"And if you do, follow that aircraft."

153
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,430
Well, other pilots would
often say things like,

154
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,840
"You mean the airplane
with the big hooters?

155
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,910
"We have it in sight."

156
00:05:56,910 --> 00:00:00,000
So, um ... (chuckles)
