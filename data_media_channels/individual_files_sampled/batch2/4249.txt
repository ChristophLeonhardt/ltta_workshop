I want to take a deeper dive into the major shake-up in president Trump's cabinet with CIA director Mike Pompeo replacing Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State President Trump has nominated Gina Haspel as the next CIA director and if confirmed she'd be the first woman ever to lead the agency who is Gina Haspel well Haspel tells The Washington Post that she spent 30 years as an officer with the CIA currently serves as deputy director she was selected for the job last February now according to the New York Times she has spent much of her time undercover but later in her career Haspel was heavily involved in the CIA's controversial torture program in 2002 she ran a secret CIA prison for suspected terrorists in Thailand that used harsh interrogation tactics including waterboarding sleep deprivation even squeezing detainees into coffins now the time says hospital oversaw the brutal questioning of two detainees one was tortured so badly at one point he appeared to be dead he was waterboarded eighty-three times in a single month and in 2005 NBC News confirms Haspel took part in an order to destroy videotapes documenting the interrogations in 2009 former President Obama ordered the secret CIA detention centers to close down joining me now Ned price former CIA intelligence officer is also an MSNBC national security analyst and Malcolm Nance who was in u.s. intelligence for almost 40 years he's also now an MSNBC terror analysts welcome to both you Malcolm let me start with you Hospital along with President Trump and Mike Pompeo have supported enhanced interrogation or torture what does that mean well it's irrelevant now because there are congressional laws which completely prohibit torture and most of those enhanced interrogation techniques from being used the way that they were used during the Bush administration's years you have to understand her position she's a career intelligence officer but she was also a deputy throughout most of that time which means when she was given orders she had to carry them out some other people may have quit but for the most part she's a career professional and I don't think I think she'll have to answer for some of the things that she did during her time but for the most part I think the agency is out of that this net what do you think yeah I can completely agree with Malcolm on this I think we have to remember that covert action programs and the CIA's detention and interrogation program was in fact a covert action program they are design conceived and authorized by policy makers by the White House in particular and by the President of the United States himself so we can't look at this as something that Gina Haspel herself cooked up this is something that hundreds if not thousands of agency personnel during that dark period did pursuant to policy aims and so I think these brave men and women were answering the call that the White House gave them now we can disagree with that call and I certainly do but I don't think this should be disqualifying for Gina Haspel herself well I guess then the question I'll keep it with you for a second Ned is whether Mike Pompeo sort of handled this in an interesting way during his confirmation hearings when asked by Senator Dianne Feinstein if he were instructed by President Trump to engage in enhanced interrogation techniques or torture would he do so and he said what Halcomb said no the law says you can't do that the CIA can't operate outside of the law but that is still going to be a question she is going to get from from senators and I guess the question is does she believe it's the right thing to do or not regardless of whether or not she would follow the law I think that's gonna be of concern to Americans well it will absolutely I will absolutely be a question she has to answer but the the key here Ally is that there is no one more opposed to intention to detention interrogation programs today then some people in the CIA they were the ones to put it crassly holding the bag with this program they carried out this program pursuant to policy aims and when times changed they were left to undergo intense scrutiny from not only law enforcement but from Congress itself so I think you will find very few champions within the intelligence community of restarting any program even resembling this director Pompeo during his confirmation hearing certainly did not speak for his future workforce and I suspect you will hear a very similar answer from Gina Haspel that the difference here of course is that she through this period and she knows the horror that period inflicted not only upon the agency but also upon upon our moral standing Malcolm do you share the view that we are not going back to a world in which torture is countenanced by our administration and our government because there are some people who still believe it should be well our administration and our government are completely different entity as compared to the CIA I don't know what the Trump administration will do they have already Donald Trump himself has already said that this is fine this is great as you know I participated in the military waterboarding program I was waterboarded this stuff is torture we teach people it's torture because our service members may be subjected to it same with agency personnel whether the policy makers will authorize this or do it in an off-the-books way use intelligence or security subcontractors to do it just so that they can affect it and feel good about themselves and you know enjoy the sadism that is ordering people to do torture I can't account for that but but I certainly believe that Trump would consider it if it made him look good well he he likes saying that he keeps up his on his campaign promises and it was in fact a promise of his to bring back waterboarding hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can
