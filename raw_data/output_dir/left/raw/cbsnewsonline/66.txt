1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,270
CONFIRMATION, THERE IS THE 

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,271
RIGHT ON THE PART OF EVERY 

3
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:10,076
MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE TO 

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,277
RELEASE DOCUMENTS THAT SHE OR 

5
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:15,048
HE BELIEVES ARE APPROPRIATE, IN 

6
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:15,582
MY VIEW. 

7
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:20,486
AND TO DELEGATE THIS DECISION 

8
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:23,890
TO AN UNAPPOINTED AND 

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,327
UNCONFIRMED AND LARGELY UNKNOWN 

10
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,029
FIGURE, BILL BURKE, WHO USED TO 

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,500
WORK FOR THE NOMINEE, IS THE 

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:48,381
HEIGHT OF 

13
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:56,289
>>> I WAS CONCERNED AND WANT TO 

14
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,224
MAKE SURE THAT WHEN A WITNESS 

15
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,193
IS QUESTIONED ABOUT A DOCUMENT, 

16
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,094
THE WITNESS HAS ACCESS TO THE 

17
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:03,329
DOCUMENT. 

18
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,698
IS NOT FARE TO THE WITNESS WHO 

19
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,767
HAS, OVER THE COURSE OF THE 

20
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,103
CAREER, BEEN INVOLVED IN THE 

21
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:10,837
AUTHORSHIP, THE REVIEW OF NOT 

22
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:11,604
JUST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, BUT 

23
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:12,872
MANY MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS IN 

24
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,774
HIS LIFETIME. 

25
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:15,607
THAT WISNER'S -- THIS WITNESS 

26
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:19,946
OR ANY OTHER, TO NOT GIVE THEM 

27
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,780
A COPY AND ALLOW HIM TO RESPOND 

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,649
WHILE HE IS BEING QUESTIONED 

29
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:22,916
ABOUT IT. 

30
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,682
THAT'S WHY I OFFERED TO SENATOR 

31
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:27,820
BOOKER AND SENATOR AND BOOKER 

32
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,222
-- SENATOR BOOKER AND I HAD A 

33
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:35,095
HELPFUL CONVERSATION. 

34
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,796
WE RELEASED THE SAME DOCUMENT 

35
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:37,463
NOW THE SAME SUBJECT. 

36
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:38,364
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE 

37
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,499
THESE AVAILABLE, TO MAKE THEM 

38
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,867
PUBLIC. 

39
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:42,968
WE CAN BE FAIR TO THE WITNESS, 

40
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:47,373
TO THE NOMINEE. 

41
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,742
I DO WANT TO POINT OUT SINCE 

42
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,579
THE CHARGE HAS BEEN MADE THAT 

43
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,780
THE PROCESS IS RIGGED AND 

44
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,114
CHARGED AND UNFAIR, THAT IT'S 

45
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:56,783
ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS, I 

46
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,617
COMPLETELY DISAGREE. 

47
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,617
WE ARE NOT DEALING IN A LAWLESS 

48
00:01:58,617 --> 00:01:59,318
ENVIRONMENT, WE ARE DEALING 

49
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:05,024
WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS 

50
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:05,257
ACT. 

51
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:05,924
WE HAVE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE THE 

52
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:06,592
SUBJECT OF PRIVILEGES, THAT 

53
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:07,760
HAVE TO BE ASSERTED. 

54
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,231
BILL BURKE IS THE DESIGNEE FOR 

55
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,398
THAT PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION

56
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:20,840
AND HAS THE PREROGATIVE OF 

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,307
ASSERTING PRIVILEGES. 

58
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,709
BUT, THROUGH AN ACCOMMODATION 

59
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,977
WITH THE SENATE, THE SENATE 

60
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:24,644
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO ALLOW US 

61
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,511
TO GAIN ACCESS TO OTHER 

62
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:26,980
DOCUMENTS TO WHICH WE WOULD NOT 

63
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,984
HAVE ACCESS, THEY HAVE AGREED 

64
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:33,586
TO HAND THOSE OVER WITH THE 

65
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,654
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE THIS 

66
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,889
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL PROCESS 

67
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,224
AND THERE ARE MEANS BY WHICH WE 

68
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,392
CAN CLEAR DOCUMENTS THAT WE 

69
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,427
WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE ABLE TO 

70
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,161
CLEAR. 

71
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,764
IT WORKED HERE AND IT'S BEEN 

72
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,099
CLEARED AND I THINK WE SHOULD 

73
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,301
MOVE FORWARD. 

74
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:48,601
THANK YOU. 

75
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,201
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 

76
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,503
>> SENATOR URBAN OR FEINSTEIN, 

77
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,938
WHICHEVER CAN GO FIRST. 

78
00:02:52,938 --> 00:03:02,549
>> I WILL ACCEPT, THANK YOU. 

79
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,416
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT BY 

80
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,083
AGREEMENT WITH PRIVATE LAWYER, 

81
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,217
BILL BURKE, THE CHAIRMAN HAS 

82
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:08,254
DESIGNATED 190,000 PAGES OF 

83
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,324
KAVANAUGH'S RECORD RECORD, 

84
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:18,464
COMMUNITY CONFIDENTIAL AND 

85
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,066
THEY'VE ARGUED THEY CAN USE 

86
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,267
THESE DOCUMENTS AT THE HEARING 

87
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,970
OR RELEASE THEM TO THE PUBLIC. 

88
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,372
UNLIKE THE INTELLIGENCE 

89
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,173
COMMITTEE, AND I'VE BEEN A 

90
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:27,807
MEMBER FOR ABOUT TWO DECADES, 

91
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:28,441
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DOESN'T 

92
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:35,882
HAVE ANY STANDING RULES ON HOW 

93
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,482
AND WHEN DOCUMENTS ARE 

94
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:36,983
DESIGNATED COMMITTEE 

95
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:37,316
CONFIDENTIAL. 

96
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:37,850
PREVIOUSLY, THE JUDICIARY 

97
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,451
COMMITTEE HAS MADE MATERIAL 

98
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,519
CONFIDENTIAL ONLY THROUGH 

99
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,554
BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT AND THAT 

100
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:46,492
HAS NOT BEEN DONE IN THIS CASE. 

101
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:55,335
THIS IS, WITHOUT PRECEDENT, THE 

102
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:55,868
REPUBLICAN'S CLAIM THAT 

103
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,402
CHAIRMAN LEAHY ACCEPTED 

104
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,003
DOCUMENTS ON A COMMUNITY 

105
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,071
CONFIDENTIAL BASIS DURING THE 

106
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,275
REAGAN ADMINISTRATION, IT'S MY 

107
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:02,942
UNDERSTANDING THEY WERE 

108
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:03,643
PROCESSED THROUGH THE NATIONAL 

109
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:04,277
ARCHIVES, NOT PRIVATE PARTISAN 

110
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:11,317
LAWYERS AND REPUBLICANS AGREED. 

111
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:15,388
99% OF THE KAGAN WHITE HOUSE 

112
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,856
RECORDS WERE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE 

113
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,192
AND COULD BE USED FREELY BY ANY 

114
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:20,426
MEMBER. 

115
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,060
BY CONTRAST, THE COMMITTEE HAS 

116
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,961
ONLY 7% OF BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 

117
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,229
WHITE HOUSE RECORDS AND ONLY 4% 

118
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,598
OF THOSE ARE AVAILABLE TO THE 

119
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:32,038
PUBLIC. 

120
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,039
NO SENATE OR COMMITTEE RULE 

121
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,207
GRANTS THE CHAIRMAN UNILATERAL 

122
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,710
AUTHORITY TO DESIGNATE DOCUMENTS

123
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,210
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL. 

124
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,749
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THAT STAMP, 

125
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:43,716
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL, GOT ON 

126
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:57,730
THESE DOCUMENTS. I SENT A LETTER

127
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,731
AUGUST 10, 2018 OBJECTING TO 

128
00:04:58,731 --> 00:04:59,298
THE BLANKET DESIGNATION OF 

129
00:04:59,298 --> 00:04:59,832
DOCUMENTS AS COMMITTEE 

130
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:00,600
CONFIDENTIAL AND I OFFERED TO 

131
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,234
WORK WITH THE CHAIR. 

132
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:09,108
HE REFUSED. 

133
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,109
JUDICIARY DEMOCRATS SAID THE 

134
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:10,843
CHAIRMAN A LETTER ON AUGUST 

135
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:11,443
28TH, RESTATING THE OBJECTION 

136
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:16,082
TO THE CHAIR'S DESIGNATION AS 

137
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,049
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL AND 

138
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:18,651
REQUESTING PUBLIC RELEASE. 

139
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,653
AS I'VE LOOKED AT THE DOCUMENTS 

140
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,588
THAT ARE COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL,

141
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:26,559
THEY DO NOT AFFECT ANY OF THE 

142
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:34,300
USUAL STANDARDS THAT WOULD DENY 

143
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:34,933
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIALITY AND, 

144
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,035
MR. CHAIRMAN, I THINK THAT IS A 

145
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,937
PROBLEM. 

146
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,305
I THINK WE ARE ENTITLED TO ALL 

147
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:46,646
RECORDS AND I THINK THE PUBLIC 

148
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,379
IS ENTITLED TO ALL RECORDS. 

149
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:47,847
ALL RECORDS THAT ARE 

150
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,914
APPROPRIATE AND DO NOT PUT 

151
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:56,122
FORWARD PERSONAL INFORMATION OR 

152
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:56,655
INFORMATION THAT SHOULD 

153
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:57,890
OTHERWISE NOT BE DISCLOSED. 

154
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,459
SO, I DO THINK WE HAVE A 

155
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,460
PROBLEM AND I THINK, FOR THE 

156
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,928
FUTURE, WE OUGHT TO SETTLE THAT 

157
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:05,130
PROBLEM WITH SOME KIND OF A 

158
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,933
WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE 

159
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:12,372
TWO SIDES. 

160
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,240
WHETHER THAT IS AN AGREEMENT 

161
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,741
BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES OF THE 

162
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,076
ENTIRE COMMITTEE, OR BETWEEN 

163
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,644
THE CHAIRMAN IN THE RANKING 

164
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:19,312
MEMBER, I THINK IT DOESN'T 

165
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:19,645
MATTER MUCH. 

166
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,113
I THINK THE FACT IS THAT WE 

167
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:26,786
SHOULD AGREE ON WHO DETERMINES 

168
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,320
SOMETHING IS COMMITTEE 

169
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,653
CONFIDENIAL. 

170
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:34,126
WHAT IS THE CRITERIA AND THE 

171
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:37,397
RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC? 

172
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,198
PARTICULARLY, IN THE EVENT OF A 

173
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:39,698
SUPREME COURT HEARING. 

174
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:41,033
>> SENATOR, SENATOR DURBIN? 

175
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,336
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 

176
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,503
LIKE MY COLLEAGUE, SENATOR 

177
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:45,538
WHITE HOUSE, I DON'T WANT MY 

178
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,372
SILENCE TO BE INTERPRETED AS 

179
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:50,443
CONSENT TO THE PROCESS THAT WE 

180
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,310
HAVE FACED BEFORE THIS SENATE 

181
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,777
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 

182
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:52,912
IT'S UNLIKE ANY PROCESS I HAVE 

183
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,716
EVER SEEN. 

184
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,351
THIS DESIGNATION OF COMMITTEE 

185
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,920
CONFIDENTIAL SHOULD BE PUT IN 

186
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,454
HISTORIC CONTEXT. 

187
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,256

PRIVATE SESSION TO DISCUSS THIS 

191
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:09,395
NOMINEE. 

192
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:09,862
THAT IS NOT UNUSUAL. 

193
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:10,496
IT'S DONE FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY 

194
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,597
NOMINEE AND SOME MEETINGS ARE 

195
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,067
LITERALLY LASTING A MINUTE OR 

196
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,234
TWO AND WE SAY THERE IS NOTHING 

197
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:18,504
TO TALK ABOUT AND WE ARE 

198
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,740
LEAVING BUT IT'S HAPPENED IN 

199
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,442
THE PAST THAT WHENEVER WE'VE 

200
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,743
DEALT WITH COMMITTEE 

201
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,243
CONFIDENTIAL IT WAS SOMETHING 

202
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:26,712
VERY SPECIFIC AND USUALLY VERY 

203
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,781
PERSONAL TO A NOMINEE AND IT 

204
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,615
WAS DONE BY BIPARTISAN 

205
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,350
AGREEMENT THAT WE WOULD PROTECT 

206
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,753
THE NOMINEE FROM ASSERTIONS OR 

207
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,321
COMMENTS THAT MAY NOT HAVE ANY 

208
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,022
TRUTH TO THEM, WHATSOEVER. 

209
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:38,624
THE COMMITTEE SHOULD TAKE INTO 

210
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,126
CONSIDERATION AND THAT IS A FAR 

211
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,762
CRY FROM WHAT WE'VE FACED WITH 

212
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,095
THIS NOMINEE. 

213
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,131
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND AND I SAID 

214
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:45,831

215
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,266

BRETT KAVANAUGH AND YOU WILL 

222
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,412

00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,449

WHICH DOCUMENTS WE CANNOT. 

226
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,017
WHO IS THIS MAN? 

227
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:05,985
BY WHAT AUTHORITY COULD HE 

228
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:12,658
POSSIBLY BE DENYING TO THE 

229
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,026

HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND? 

233
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,133
THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES IS 

234
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,603
USUALLY THE STARTING POINT OF 

235
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,336
THIS PROCESS. 

236
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,471
I PUT IN THE RECORD YESTERDAY, 

237
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:26,772
A STATEMENT FROM THE NATIONAL

239
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:30,676
PROCESS, SAYING THIS IS NOT THE 

240
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,010
WAY WE'VE DONE THIS IN THE 

241
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,244
PAST. 

242
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:32,879
WE USUALLY INITIATE THIS. 

243
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,748
PLEASE GIVE US A FEW WEEKS TO 

244
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,717
DO THIS IN AN ORDERLY WAY BUT 

245
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,784
THE DECISION WAS MADE BY THE 

246
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,385
WHITE HOUSE AND THE 

247
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,053
ADMINISTRATION NOT TO GO DOWN 

248
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,056
THAT PATH AND NOT TO TAKE THE 

249
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,759
SAME COURSE WE HAVE ON PREVIOUS 

250
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,259

251
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,061
INSTEAD, TO ALLOW, TO THIS

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,525
BANNON, A MAN WHOM I COULDN'T 

269
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,761
CHARACTERIZE IN A FEW WORDS. 

270
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,329
HE IS THE PERSONAL ATTORNEY AND 

271
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,531
IN THIS SITUATION, HE IS NOW 

272
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,899
THE LITMUS TEST ON THE FILTER 

273
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,733

TO KNOW. 

282
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,713
WE NOW KNOW THAT LESS THAN 10% 

283
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,982
OF THE DOCUMENTS REFLECTING THE 

284
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,116

TOGETHER. 

294
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,803
I HOPE MY OTHER COLLEAGUES WILL 

295
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,605
JOIN ME, SO THAT THERE IS GOING 

296
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,439

00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,139

I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW BILL 

302
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,983

HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY -- IS ONE 

304
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,089
OF MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED -- 

305
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,190
THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A 

306
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:24,756
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT. 

307
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:26,291
A TOP SECRET DOCUMENT. 

308
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,559

COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL? 

314
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,568
HE HAS NO AUTHORITY TO DO THAT. 

315
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,471
HE ONLY HAS AUTHORITY BECAUSE 

316
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,039
HE HAS THE CONSENT AND THE 

317
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,375
COOPERATION OF THE PUBLIC -- 

318
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,510
THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY ON THIS 

319
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:44,810
COMMITTEE. 

320
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,644
THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT 

321
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:49,281
BRINGS US TO THIS MOMENT. 

322
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,650
LET ME SAY IN CLOSING, ONE LAST 

323
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:51,883
THING. 

324
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:53,252
I'M SORRY THAT ONE OF MY 

325
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:53,852
COLLEAGUES HAS CHARACTERIZED 

326
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:54,586
ALL OF THIS ON THE DEMOCRATIC 

327
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:56,155
SIDE ON THE FIRST DAY OF THIS 

328
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,424
HEARING AS CONTEMPTUOUS. 

329
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:01,460
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT SAID 

330
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,827
BEFORE IN A FULL COMMITTEE 

331
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:04,363
MEETING BUT IT'S BEEN SAID AND 

332
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,932
DONE PARTICULARLY SORRY THAT HE 

333
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,601
SINGLED OUT ONE OF OUR 

334
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,036
COLLEAGUES ON THIS SIDE AND 

335
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:10,970
ACCUSED HIM OF CONDUCT 

336
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,138
UNBECOMING A UNITED STATES 

337
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:12,905
SENATOR. 

338
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,139
I THINK STATEMENTS LIKE THAT 

339
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,041
ARE PERSONAL AND DISPARAGING 

340
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,143
AND THEY QUESTION THE MOTIVE OF 

341
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:17,510
THE COLLEAGUE. 

342
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,611
IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO OUR 

343
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,380
VERY BEST TO AVOID IN THE U.S. 

344
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,415
SENATE, IF WE ARE EVER GOING TO 

345
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,549

346
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:27,219
BODY. 

347
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,587
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 

348
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,287
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 

349
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:30,155
>> MAY I MAKE A BRIEF POINT? 

350
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:31,056
MR. CHAIRMAN, I'M LOOKING AT A 

351
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:36,962

370
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:08,160

371
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,495
CHOOSING BRUCE LINDSAY FOR THAT 

372
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:09,828
SAME PURPOSE. 

373
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:12,898
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 

374
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:20,139
>> I THINK MY COLLEAGUE -- COUNT

375
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:20,706

376
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,107
MR. CHAIRMAN, I, TOO, REFERRED 

377
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:27,546
TO A SO-CALLED COMMITTEE 

378
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,146
CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT DEEMED 

379
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:29,615
SUCH BY ONE BILL BURKE AND WHAT 

380
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:34,086
WE ALL KNOW, WE KNOW WHO HE IS, 

381
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:34,486
AT THIS POINT. 

382
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:35,420
HAD THE NOMINEE ASKED ME FOR A 

383
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,291
COPY OF THAT SO-CALLED COMMITTEE

384
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,760
CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT, I WOULD 

385
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,330
HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO RELEASE IT 

386
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,732
TO HIM OUR GIVE IT TO HIM. 

387
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,533
I'M RELEASING THAT DOCUMENT TO 

388
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,467
THE PRESS AND I WOULD DEFY 

389
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,135
ANYONE READING THIS DOCUMENT TO 

390
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:56,408
BE ABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS 

391
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,276
SHOULD BE DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL 

392
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,211
IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. 

393
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,780
THANK YOU. 

394
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,718
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? I 

395
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,551
KNOW YOU'VE MENTIONED A NUMBER 

396
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,954
OF TIMES THAT I WENT THROUGH 

397
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:09,889
THE PROCESS. 

398
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,025
I DO WANT TO POINT OUT, HOWEVER,

399
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,293
THAT I ALSO WAS ON NUMEROUS 

400
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:17,229
LETTERS ASKING FOR ALL THESE 

401
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,264
DOCUMENTS TO BE RELEASED. 

402
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,932
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE REPEATEDLY 

403
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:20,699
ASKED FOR DOCUMENTS TO BE 

404
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:20,966
RELEASED. 

405
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,766
I GO BACK TO WHAT HAPPENED ON 

406
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:27,273
THE FIRST MORNING OF THIS 

407
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,808
HEARING IN THAT IS THAT WE 

408
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,809
POINTED OUT THAT WHEN THERE ARE 

409
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,910
42,000 DOCUMENTS THAT ARE 

410
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,447
DUMPED ON US IN ONE NIGHT, 

411
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,482
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY 

412
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,716
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ADEQUATELY 

413
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,785
BE ABLE TO REVIEW THEM AND AS 

414
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:40,953
THEY REVIEW THEM, THEY WILL 

415
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,222
FIND DOCUMENTS THEY WANT TO BE 

416
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,490
MADE PUBLIC AND THAT THEY WANT 

417
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,358
TO ASK THE NOMINEE ABOUT. 

418
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,326
THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS 

419
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,894
BECAUSE THIS HEARING WAS RAMROD 

420
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,063
THROUGH AND WE WEREN'T GIVEN 

421
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,164
THE MONTH IT WOULD TAKE TO LOOK 

422
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,532
AT THESE DOCUMENTS, WE ARE 

423
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,368
WHERE WE ARE. 

424
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,536
MY REMEDY FOR THIS, IN ADDITION 

425
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,904
TO MAKING IT CLEAR THAT I JOIN 

426
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:06,946
MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE SUPPORT ú 

427
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,048
IS THAT WE MUST SOMEHOW 

428
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:11,217
EXPEDITE THE REVIEW OF EVERY 

429
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,251
SINGLE DOCUMENT AND WE MUST 

430
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,686
HAVE SOME KIND OF RULES IN 

431
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,455
PLACE TO GET THEM OUT. I 

432
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,590
UNDERSTAND YOU WOULD WANT TO 

433
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,758
TAKE OUT SOCIAL SECURITY 

434
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,393
NUMBERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. 

435
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,494
THAT'S NORMAL BUT WE SIMPLY 

436
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,395
CANNOT HIDE THESE DOCUMENTS 

437
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:23,995
FROM THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. 

438
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:25,330
IT IS THE HIGHEST COURT OF THE 

439
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:25,531
LAND. 

440
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:30,002
LOOKING BACK, EVERYONE WAS 

441
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:30,803
CITING THE FOUNDERS OF THIS 

442
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,837
COUNTRY AND I FOUND A QUOTE 

443
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:37,876
THAT REALLY WORKS FROM MADISON. 

444
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:38,477
A POPULAR GOVERNMENT WITHOUT 

445
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,244
POPULAR INFORMATION OR THE 

446
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:40,713
MEANS OF ACQUIRING IT IS BUT A 

447
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:45,951
PROLOGUE TO A FARCE OR A 

448
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:46,251
TRAGEDY. 

449
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,654
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING 

450
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:48,954
ABOUT HERE. 

451
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,789
BY RAM RIDING THIS THROUGH FOR 

452
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:51,356
POLITICAL REASONS, WE ARE 

453
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:52,157
DENYING THE ACCESS TO THE 

454
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,358
DOCUMENTS, WE ARE DENYING THE 

455
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:57,162
PUBLIC THE RIGHT TO SEE WHAT IS 

456
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,864
OUT THERE AND IT'S JUST NOT HOW 

457
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,101
WE DO THINGS IN MY STATE AND 

458
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,636
NOT HOW WE'VE DONE THINGS IN 

459
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:05,337
THIS COMMITTEE. 

460
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:05,904
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 

461
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,205
>> I'M GOING TO CALL ON SENATOR 

462
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:09,074
LEE AND THEN YOU. A 

463
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:09,909
COUPLE OF THINGS SHE JUST 

464
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,310
REMINDED ME OF IN HER COMMENTS 

465
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:20,886
-- NUMBER ONE, TO TAKE CARE OF 

466
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:21,854
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T ACT 

467
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,788
PROMPTLY LIKE YOU DID, SENATOR 

468
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:23,756
KLOBUCHAR, THAT IS WHAT WE 

469
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,623
EXTENDED IT AND GIVE THE 

470
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,190
COURTESY OF DOING WHATEVER 

471
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,094
ANYBODY ELSE WANTS, NOW. 

472
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,496
THOSE CAN EITHER BE BROUGHT UP 

473
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,296
NOW OR THOSE THAT YOU'VE GOT 

474
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:32,464
CAN BE BROUGHT UP RIGHT NOW TO 

475
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,734
HIM AND THE THINGS THAT AREN'T 

476
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,971
CLEAR, THAT YOU WANT TO BRING 

477
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,439
UP WITH THE JUDGE, YOU CAN 

478
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,107
BRING UP IN THE CLOSED SESSION 

479
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:42,541
TODAY. 

480
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,876
THE OTHER THING IS, WHEN YOU 

481
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,511
TALK ABOUT GETTING ALL THE 

482
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,612
DOCUMENTS, I DON'T KNOW WHO 

483
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,680
MIGHT WORK FOR MEMBERS OF THIS 

484
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,447
COMMITTEE SOMETIMES TO WANT TO 

485
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:56,822
BE ON THE SUPREME COURT, AND, 

486
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,092
FOR INSTANCE, WE DIDN'T ASK FOR 

487
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,660
ALL THE DOCUMENTS THAT KAGAN 

488
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,694
HAD AND THE EMAILS OR WHATEVER 

489
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:03,428
COMMUNICATIONS SHE WOULD HAVE 

490
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:04,663
HAD WHEN SHE WORKED WITH 

491
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:05,063
SENATOR KENNEDY. 

492
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:06,131
WOULD YOU WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO 

493
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:10,102
THAT SORT OF THING? 

494
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,103
IF YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO BE 

495
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,070
MADE PUBLIC, OR ALL THE EMAILS 

496
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:18,043
THAT YOU HAVE -- I THINK THEY 

497
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:18,977
ARE PROTECTED FOR 50 YEARS FOR 

498
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:19,978
THE U.S. SENATORS. 

499
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,780
SO, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 

500
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,614
PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW. 

501
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,551
DO YOU WANT TO GIVE UP YOUR 

502
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,553
EMAILS RIGHT NOW AND MAKE THEM 

503
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,020
PUBLIC? 

504
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,853
I DON'T THINK YOU DO. 

505
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:29,288
SENATOR LEE? 

506
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,623
>> FIRST OF ALL, MR. CHAIRMAN, 

507
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,292
I WANT TO SAY I'M DEEPLY 

508
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,660
SYMPATHETIC TO THE FRUSTRATION 

509
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,828
PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEY DON'T 

510
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,162
HAVE ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS THEY 

511
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:37,830
WANT. 

512
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,631
AS A U.S. SENATOR, I'VE PASTED 

513
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,500
THIS ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. 

514
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,936
WE'VE BEEN CALLED UPON TO VOTE 

515
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,170
LITERALLY AT THE MIDNIGHT HOUR 

516
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,973
OR LATER AND WE HADN'T SEEN THE 

517
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:48,640
IT WAS VOTED ON. 

518
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,710
THEY HAVE BEEN TIMES, I KID YOU 

519
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,212
NOT, WHEN I'VE BEEN ASKED TO 

520
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,214
VOTE ON LEGISLATION THAT HAS AN 

521
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,049
ANNEX AND I'M TOLD I CAN'T SEE 

522
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,083
THE ANNEX BECAUSE IT'S 

523
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,017
CLASSIFIED AND CLASSIFIED IN A 

524
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:02,254
WAY I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO 

525
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,188
BECAUSE OF A COMMITTEE 

526
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,790
ASSIGNMENT THAT I DO NOT HAVE. 

527
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,957
IT'S INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING. 

528
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,925
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE LOOK 

529
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:09,261
FOR A DEMON. 

530
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,362
THERE ARE DEMONS IN THOSE 

531
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,329
CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY ARE TOO 

532
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,598
NUMEROUS TO NAME HERE. 

533
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,766
IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, THERE IS 

534
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:19,037
A DEMON BUT THAT DEMON IS A LAW 

535
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:19,771
OF OUR OWN CREATION. 

536
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:20,704
CALLED THE PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS 

537
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:20,905
ACT. 

538
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:21,772
THAT'S THE DEMON THAT YOU ARE 

539
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:22,875
AFTER HERE AND THE ONLY REASON 

540
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,742
WE'VE GOT THIS ISSUE. 

541
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,410
NOW, THE CUSTODIAN OF THOSE 

542
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:32,451
DOCUMENTS HOLDS AND EXERCISES A 

543
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,653
PRIVILEGE ON BEHALF OF THE BUSH 

544
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,154
ADMINISTRATION. 

545
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,822
THESE ARE DOCUMENTS WE WOULD 

546
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,290
OTHERWISE NOT HAVE ACCESS TO 

547
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,426
BECAUSE THEY ARE PRIVILEGED. 

548
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,661
PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT TO THE 

549
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,762
SENATE AND AN ACCOMMODATION TO 

550
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,129
THE SENATE, THE CUSTODIAN HAS 

551
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:46,698
AGREED, NOTWITHSTANDING THE 

552
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,467
NATURE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, TO 

553
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,203
HAND THEM OVER TO US WITH THE 

554
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,404
UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN THERE 

555
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,506
WAS A NEED THAT ARISES WITH 

556
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,874
RESPECT TO ONE OF THOSE 

557
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,142
DOCUMENTS TO MAKE THEM PUBLIC, 

558
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,645
WE CAN, AS A COMMITTEE, GO 

559
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,646
THROUGH THE PROCESS TO DO THAT 

560
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:01,580
AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT 

561
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,485
HAS WORKED AND IT'S WORKED HERE 

562
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:06,752
TODAY. 

563
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,419
IF YOU ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE 

564
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,487
DOCUMENTS, LET'S REVIEW THE 

565
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:14,793
PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT. WE ARE

566
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:15,994
JUST DOING WHAT THE LAW ALLOWS 

567
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:16,895
US TO DO. 

568
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:17,495
THESE DOCUMENTS ARE NOT OURS. 

569
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:22,501
THEY BELONG TO SOMEONE ELSE. 

570
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,536
IT IS NOT WRITTEN INTO THE 

571
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,471
CONSTITUTION AND IT IS NOT 

572
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:27,706
WRITTEN ON STONE TABLETS 

573
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,142
ANYWHERE THAT WE ARE ENTITLED TO

574
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,544
DOCUMENTS THAT DON'T BELONG TO 

575
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:32,911
US. 

576
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,346
IT'S SIGNIFICANT THAT WILLIAM 

577
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,480
HOWARD TAFT ISN'T RELEASE HIS 

578
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,248
PRESIDENTIAL PAPERS AND IT'S 

579
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:36,781
SIGNIFICANT THAT ROBERT 

580
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:37,816
JACKSON, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, 

581
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,152
DIDN'T SOLVE -- DIDN'T SHOW THE 

582
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:40,519
PAPERS HE HAD. 

583
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:45,023
I ASSUME IT HAD A LOT TO DO 

584
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,926
WITH THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T 

585
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,262
BELONG TO US, AS THE SENATE. 

586
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:53,432
IF WE WANT TO PROCESS WITH THIS 

587
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,933
ADMINISTRATION AND EVERY 

588
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:55,533
PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION, 

589
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:56,267
DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN OR ANY 

590
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:57,069
OTHER STRIPE IN THE FUTURE, WE 

591
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,369
NEED TO RESPECT THE PROCESS AND 

592
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:02,307
RESPECT THE PRIVILEGE THAT IS 

593
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,875
ACCORDED TO DOCUMENTS THAT DO 

594
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:04,542
NOT BELONG TO US. 

595
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:05,477
THAT'S ALL WE ARE ASKING AND 

596
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,077
THE PROCESS IS WORKING. 

597
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:10,349
LET'S MOVE FORWARD. 

598
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,449
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 

599
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:12,451
ON BEHALF OF THIS SIDE, I WOULD 

600
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,484
LIKE TO SAY COUPLE OF THINGS. 

601
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:16,822
THERE IS NO PROCESS FOR THE 

602
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,857
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL. 

603
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:19,958
IT USED TO BE THAT BOTH SIDES 

604
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,228
HAD TO CONCUR. THE CHAIR AND 

605
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,963
THE RANKING MEMBER. 

606
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,099
NOW, THIS IS JUST SIMPLY NOT 

607
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:37,142
THE CASE. TO SOME EXTENT, WITH 

608
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,144
THIS KIND OF THING, COMMITTEE 

609
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:39,844
CONFIDENTIAL BECOMES A KIND OF 

610
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:40,745
A CROCK AND IT SHOULDN'T. 

611
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:41,713
I THINK WE NEED TO SIT DOWN. 

612
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:47,185
WE NEED TO HAVE A RULE ON HOW 

613
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:47,819
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL IS 

614
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:48,453
DETERMINED, ON WHAT IT MEANS 

615
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:53,491
AND WHO MAKES THAT DECISION. 

616
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:54,292
FOR ALL I KNOW, SOME REPUBLICAN 

617
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:59,331
STAFFER COULD HAVE MADE THE 

618
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,668
DECISION. 

619
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,803
I JUST DON'T KNOW. 

620
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,072
DOCUMENTS APPEAR AND OUR SITE 

621
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,707
HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO 

622
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,108
WITH THE DESIGNATION OF 

623
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:10,942
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL. 

624
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:14,880
IT BECOMES A WAY, IF THERE IS NO

625
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,715
RULE, FOR THE MAJORITY TO, 

626
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,249
ESSENTIALLY, PUT ALL 

627
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,817
INFORMATION THROUGH A STRAINER. 

628
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,852
SHOULD WE LET THIS GO OUT AND 

629
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,255
BE PUBLIC, OR SHOULD WE NOT? 

630
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,289
I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT THIS 

631
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,156
COMMITTEE IS ABOUT. 

632
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:26,057
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 

633
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:27,559
>> YOU KNOW, IN THE ABSENCE OF 

634
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:34,466
A MAJORITY OF A COMMITTEE 

635
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,334
OPPOSED, THE CHAIRMAN ACTS ON 

636
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,168
BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE AND 

637
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,101
CHAIRMAN LEAHY ACCEPTED 

638
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:41,206
DOCUMENTS ON A COMMITTEE 

639
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:41,773
CONFIDENTIAL BASIS DURING 

640
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,407
JUSTICE KAGAN'S NOMINATION AND 

641
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:47,312
THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE 

642
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:51,917
RANKING MEMBER AGREED TO THAT, 

643
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,651
AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME. 

644
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,285
SENATOR 

645
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,087
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

646
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,321
TWO QUICK POINTS, IF IT COULD. 

647
00:20:57,321 --> 00:21:00,325
THE QUESTION HAS BEEN RAISED, 

648
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,292
WHOSE DOCUMENTS ARE THESE? 

649
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,059
THESE ARE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S 

650
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:02,360
DOCUMENTS. 

651
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,528
THEY ACT FOR RECORDS GIVES US 

652
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:09,034
THE ACT OF RETAINING THEM AFTER 

653
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,035
THE REVIEW OF PROFESSIONALS AT 

654
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,036
THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND BILL 

655
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:11,837
BURKE IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL AT 

656
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:12,703
THE ARCHIVES. 

657
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:18,143
THE ARCHIVES HAVE SAID IT'S NOT 

658
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,043
THEIR PROCESS. 

659
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:20,212
EQUALLY AND IMPORTANTLY, BECAUSE

660
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,713
SOME WILL MAKE DIRE PREDICTIONS 

661
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:22,914
ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE RELEASE 

662
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,916
OF THESE DOCUMENTS, BILL BURKE, 

663
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,017
HIMSELF, IN HIS LETTER TO US ON 

664
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:27,252
AUGUST 31 SAID -- I QUOTE -- 

665
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:31,890
THE PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT 

666
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,457
WHICH PROTECTS AGAINST THE 

667
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,024
DISCLOSURE OF CLASSIFIED 

668
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:34,092
INFORMATION, DID NOT APPLY TO 

669
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:40,198
ANY DOCUMENTS OUR TEAM 

670
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:40,732
REVIEWED. I 

671
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:41,400
AGREE WITH SENATOR BOOKER. 

672
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,034
THIS CONFIRMATION IS TOO 

673
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,034
IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONCEAL 

674
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:46,904
DOCUMENTS THAT MAY REVEAL THE 

675
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:48,073
NOMINEE'S VIEWS AND I THINK WE 

676
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:48,707
SHOULD BE PROCEEDING UNDER 

677
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:49,074
THESE GROUNDS. 

678
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:52,811
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 

679
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,045
MAY I BE RECOGNIZED, SIR? 

680
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:56,181
>> I HOPE YOU DON'T SAY THE 

681
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,148
SAME THING AGAIN. 

682
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:59,451
>> SIR, I WILL NOT. 

683
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,085
I WILL SAY SOMETHING I HAVEN'T 

684
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:02,854
SAID. I 

685
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,356
APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE YOU'VE 

686
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,225
BEEN SHOWING AND I ALSO WANT TO 

687
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,260
SAY THAT THE REPRESENTATIONS 

688
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,194
FROM SENATOR KENNEDY AND 

689
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,162
SENATOR LEE WERE RIGHT ON 

690
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:10,996
POINT, THEY STOOD STRONG LAST 

691
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,663
NIGHT AND CHALLENGED ME. 

692
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,931
THEY NOT ONLY WERE COLLEGIAL 

693
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:17,469
BUT THEY LOOKED TO FIND A FAIR 

694
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,904
WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS PROCESS 

695
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,239
AND I WANT TO EXPRESS MY 

696
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:21,572
APPRECIATION. 

697
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:22,173
I WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING 

698
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:22,740
THAT I'VE SAID BEFORE. 

699
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:28,347
THERE IS NO SENATE RULE THAT 

700
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,882
ACCOUNTS FOR THIS PROCESS, 

701
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:31,115
PERIOD. 

702
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:31,883
THIS IS NOT A SENATE RULE. 

703
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,818
I DID NOT VIOLATE A CENTER -- A 

704
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:37,289
SENATE RULE. I 

705
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:37,589
WILL PAUSE. 

706
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,623
THERE IS NO SENATE RULE THAT 

707
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,491
ARE VIOLATED BECAUSE THERE IS 

708
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,892
NO SENATE RULE THAT ACCOUNTS 

709
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,995
FOR THIS PROCESS. 

710
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,530
I SAY TO A CHAIRMAN THAT I 

711
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,565
RESPECT AND I BELIEVE HAS BEEN 

712
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,732
FAIR AND GOOD TO ME, I WILL SAY 

713
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:54,740
THAT I DID WILLINGLY VIOLATE THE

714
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,309
CHAIR'S RULE ON THE COMMITTEE 

715
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,109
CONFIDENTIAL PROCESS. I 

716
00:22:58,109 --> 00:22:59,510
TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR 

717
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,012
VIOLATING THAT, SIR. 

718
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,314
I VIOLATED IT BECAUSE I 

719
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,915
SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT THE 

720
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,984
PUBLIC DESERVES TO KNOW THIS 

721
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,384
NOMINEE'S RECORD. 

722
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,085
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, HIS 

723
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,053
RECORD ON ISSUES OF RACE AND 

724
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,223
THE LAW AND I COULD NOT 

725
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,326
UNDERSTAND AND I VIOLATED THIS 

726
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,160
RULE KNOWINGLY, WHY THESE 

727
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,128
ISSUES SHOULD BE WITHHELD FROM 

728
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:17,428
THE PUBLIC. 

729
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:18,964
NOW, I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS 

730
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:19,798
OF MY COLLEAGUES. 

731
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:20,632
IT'S ABOUT THE CLOSEST I WILL 

732
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:21,666
PROBABLY EVER HAVE IN MY LIFE 

733
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,869
TO A SPARTACUS MOMENT. 

734
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,636
MY COLLEAGUES, NUMBERS OF THEM, 

735
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:31,676
SAID THEY EXPECT -- ACCEPT THE 

736
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,277
RESPONSIBILITY. 

737
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,945
THERE WERE SERIOUS CHARGES MADE 

738
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,981
AGAINST ME BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM 

739
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,015
TEXAS AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY 

740
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:37,716
WERE POLITICAL BLUSTER OR 

741
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:38,116
SINCERE FEELINGS. 

742
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,185
IF WHAT HE SAID WAS CONSIDER, 

743
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:40,952
THEIR ACTUALLY ARE SENATE RULES 

744
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:45,090
GOVERNING THE BEHAVIOR OF 

745
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,357
SENATORS. 

746
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,291
IF HE FEELS THAT I AND MY 

747
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,492
FELLOW COLLEAGUES WHO ARE WITH 

748
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:53,197
ME HAVE VIOLATED THOSE RULES, 

749
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:56,167
THAT HE IS NOT A TEMPEST IN A 

750
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:56,801
TEAPOT BUT SINCERELY BELIEVES 

751
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:57,601
THAT, THEN BRING THE CHARGES. 

752
00:23:57,601 --> 00:24:02,040
GO THROUGH THE SENATE PROCESS 

753
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,008
TO TAKE ON SOMEBODY THAT YOU 

754
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,142
SAID IS UNBECOMING TO BE A 

755
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:04,409
SENATOR. 

756
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:11,183
LET'S GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS 

757
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,851
BECAUSE I THINK THE PUBLIC 

758
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:13,752
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE 

759
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,720
MOMENT SOMEBODY IS UP FOR A 

760
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,988
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT, THAT THIS 

761
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,891
ISSUE, DOES THE PUBLIC HAVE A 

762
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,426
RIGHT TO KNOW? 

763
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,361
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL 

764
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,729
RECORDS ACT OR A VIOLATION OF 

765
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,131
THE PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT. 

766
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,465
IT'S NOT A VIOLATION OF SENATE 

767
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,001
RULES BUT IF SOMEBODY WILL LAND 

768
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,403
THOSE CHARGES, I HOPE THAT THEY 

769
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,304
WILL FOLLOW THROUGH WITH ME AND 

770
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,672
SENATOR DURBIN, SENATOR SENATOR 

771
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:40,579
WHITE HOUSE AND SENATOR HER ONO 

772
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,279
AND SENATOR BLUMENTHAL AND NOW 

773
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:41,712
SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 

774
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:47,953
I HOPE THEY WILL BRING CHARGES 

775
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,454
AGAINST US AND I'M READY TO 

776
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,223
ACCEPT THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY 

777
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,124
FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE, THE 

778
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,093
CONSEQUENCES FOR WHAT I HAVE 

779
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,027
DONE AND I STAND BY THE 

780
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:56,861
PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO HAVE ACCESS 

781
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:58,396
TO THIS DOCUMENT AND KNOW THIS 

782
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,131
NOMINEE'S VIEWS ON ISSUES ARE 

783
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:04,435
PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT, LIKE RACE 

784
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:05,370
AND THE LAW, TORTURE AND OTHER 

785
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,037
ISSUES. 

786
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:12,109
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, MAY I READ THE 

787
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:14,479
SENATE RULE 295, THE STANDING 

788
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,047
RULES OF THE SENATE FOR THE 

789
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,216
BENEFIT OF ALL SENATORS? 

790
00:25:19,216 --> 00:25:20,085
AND A SENATOR, OFFICER OR 

791
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:20,952
EMPLOYEE OF THE SENATE WHO 

792
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:21,619
SHALL DISCLOSE THE SECRET OR 

793
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:22,153
CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS OR 

794
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,856
PROCEEDINGS OF THE SENATE, 

795
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:25,423
INCLUDING THE BUSINESS AND 

796
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,224
PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMMITTEES, 

797
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:26,824
SUBCOMMITTEES AND OFFICES OF 

798
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:29,193
THE SENATE SHALL BE LIABLE IF A 

799
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:35,734
SENATOR SUFFERS EXPULSION FROM 

800
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:36,868
THE BODY AND IF AN OFFICER OR 

801
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,702
EMPLOYEE, DISMISSAL FROM THE 

802
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,235
SERVICE OF THE SENATE AND 

803
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:45,544
PUNISHMENT OR CONTEMPT. 

804
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,646
I WOULD CORRECT THE SENATOR'S 

805
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:48,813
STATEMENT THERE IS NO RULE. 

806
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:49,814
THERE CLEARLY IS A RULE THAT 

807
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:50,081
APPLIES. 

808
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,651
>> APPLY THE RULE AND BRING THE 

809
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:52,918
CHARGES. 

810
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,486
>> ALL OF US ARE READY TO FACE 

811
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,888
THAT RULE ON THE BOGUS 

812
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:04,295
DESIGNATION OF COMMITTEE 

813
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:05,830
CONFIDENTIAL. 

814
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,765
JUST BECAUSE, THERE IS A SENATE 

815
00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:09,367
RULE, DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN BE 

816
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,367
MISAPPLIED OR MISCONSTRUED OR 

817
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:20,745
MISUSED. 

818
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,680
I THINK EVEN THE THREAT RAISED 

819
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,847
BY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE IS 

820
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:23,882
UNFORTUNATE AND THAT IS A KIND 

821
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,250
WAY OF PUTTING IT WITH ALL DUE 

822
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:25,517
RESPECT. 

823
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:26,451
I WOULD JUST MAKE ONE OTHER 

824
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,218
POINT. 

825
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,118
WE ARE DEALING WITH A LIFETIME 

826
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:28,452
APPOINTMENT. 

827
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:29,521
NOTHING WE DO HERE IS MORE 

828
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:33,391
SERIOUS THAN CONFIRMING A 

829
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:34,225
JUSTICE ON THE U.S. SUPREME 

830
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:34,459
COURT. 

831
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,326
LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

832
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:41,366
APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE HERE IN 

833
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,133
THE MOST SOLEMN RESPONSIBILITY 

834
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:47,305
WE HAVE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. 

835
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,108
WE NEED THE FULL TRUTH, JUST AS 

836
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,078
THIS NOMINEE IS SWORN, TO GIVE 

837
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:53,845
IT TO US. 

838
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:56,681
WE ARE ENTITLED TO IT FROM OUR 

839
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,516
COLLEAGUES IN THE QUESTION IS, 

840
00:26:58,516 --> 00:26:59,851
WHAT ARE THEY CONCEALING BY 

841
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:00,284
THIS PROCEDURE? 

842
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:01,720
WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID THE 

843
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,122
AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SEE AND 

844
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,523
WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID WE WOULD 

845
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,725
ASK OF THIS NOMINEE IF WE HAD 

846
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:07,525
ALL OF THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT 

847
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:11,296
HAVE BEEN DENIED US IN THIS 

848
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,765
SHAM AND CHARADE? 

849
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:17,602
>> SENATOR LEE AND THEN SENATOR 

850
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:17,835
TILLIS. 

851
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:18,903
>> THE DOCUMENT YOU ARE TALKING 

852
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:22,874
ABOUT HAS NOW BEEN APPROVED 

853
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,375
THROUGH THE COMMITTEE PROCESSES 

854
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:24,775
AND MADE PUBLIC. 

855
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:26,311
THE PROCESS WORKED AND I 

856
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,579
PLEDGED TO WORK WITH EACH AND 

857
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,813
EVERY ONE OF YOU. 

858
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,081
IF YOU HAVE A DOCUMENT, AS TO 

859
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,549
WHICH A PRIVILEGE HAS BEEN 

860
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,618
ASSERTED SUCH THAT IT IS NOT 

861
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,786
PUBLIC, YET, I WILL WORK WITH 

862
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,354
YOU TO TRY TO MAKE A PUBLIC. 

863
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:37,421
LET'S DO IT. 

864
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:39,824
I THINK WE CAN DO THIS. 

865
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,992
IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT AND WE 

866
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,428
HAVE DONE THIS AT LEAST THREE 

867
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:43,728
TIMES, NOW. 

868
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:44,929
WE CAN DO IT MORE. 

869
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,898
THE PRIVILEGE THING IS REAL, 

870
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:47,165
THOUGH. 

871
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,701
IT'S NOT OUR PRIVILEGE WE ARE 

872
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:50,301
DEALING WITH. 

873
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,168
IT'S A PRIVILEGE THAT BELONGS 

874
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,270
TO SOMEONE ELSE. 

875
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,771
THE PRIVILEGED NATURE OF 

876
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:56,107
DOCUMENTS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A 

877
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,876
LONG TIME, SINCE THE EARLY DAYS 

878
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,879
OF THE REPUBLIC. 

879
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,414
THE RECORDS AND NOTES TO THE 

880
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,047
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WERE 

881
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:05,350
ORDERED SEALED FOR 30 YEARS 

882
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,385
AFTER THE CONVENTION IN 1787. 

883
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,187
I'M NOT SURE OF THE REASONS WHY 

884
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,588
BUT THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED 

885
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:11,723
DECIDED THE RULE. 

886
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,059
SEALED FOR 30 YEARS AND THOSE 

887
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,760
DOCUMENTS DIDN'T BELONG TO 

888
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,093
ANYONE ELSE. 

889
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:17,929
THEY BELONGED TO THOSE THAT 

890
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,165
CONTENT -- TO THOSE THAT 

891
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,100
ATTENDED THE CONVENTION AND 

892
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,033
PARTICIPATED IN IT. 

893
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:24,869
THERE WERE TWO, OLIVER 

894
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,137
ELLSWORTH AND JAMES WILSON, WHO 

895
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,071
WERE SUBSEQUENTLY NOMINATED TO 

896
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:28,273
SERVE ON THE U.S. SUPREME 

897
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:28,506
COURT. 

898
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,440
NO ONE DEMANDED, TO MY 

899
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,107
KNOWLEDGE AND NO ONE COULD HAVE 

900
00:28:30,107 --> 00:28:37,882
GOTTEN -- NOTWITHSTANDING THE 

901
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,117
THIRTY-YEAR SEAL AGREEMENT -- 

902
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,585
THE NOTES TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL 

903
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:41,853
CONVENTION, EVEN THOUGH THOSE 

904
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:42,787
CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN 

905
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:43,988
PROBATIVE AS TO HOW THOSE 

906
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,590
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SERVED ON THE 

907
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,957
SUPREME COURT. 

908
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,058
NO ONE ACCUSED THE U.S. SENATE 

909
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:51,329
OF BEING A RUBBERSTAMP FOR THE 

910
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,529
WASHINGTON ADMINISTRATION OR 

911
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:54,999
ANYONE ELSE. 

912
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:55,934
IN 1795, THE U.S. SENATE 

913
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,002
DISAPPROVED OF AT LEAST ONE OF 

914
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,003
PRESIDENT WASHINGTON'S SUPREME 

915
00:28:59,003 --> 00:28:59,504
COURT NOMINEES. 

916
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,805
THIS WAS NOT A RUBBERSTAMP. 

917
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,507
THE RESPECT OF THE FACT THAT 

918
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,675
THEY DIDN'T OWN EVERY DOCUMENT 

919
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,376
AND THAT OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT OWN 

920
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,377
THEM. 

921
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,046
WE DON'T OWN THESE AND WE HAVE 

922
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:08,879
TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS, 

923
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:11,349
PROCESS ORDAINED BY A LAW THAT 

924
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,717
WE PASSED AND THAT ONLY WE HAVE 

925
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:13,818
THE POWER TO CHANGE. 

926
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:14,886
LET'S FOLLOW THAT LAW. 

927
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,154
WE CAN FOLLOW THE LAW AND 

928
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,389
RESPECT THE PROCESS AND THE 

929
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,390
RIGHTS OF EACH OF OUR 

930
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,326
COLLEAGUES AND THE RIGHTS OF 

931
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,293
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO REVIEW 

932
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,928
DOCUMENTS THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT

933
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,128
HERE. 

934
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:24,863
LET'S GO THROUGH THE 

935
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:25,897
APPROPRIATE PROCESS TO DO IT. 

936
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,899
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 

937
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,903
>> I THINK I OUGHT TO BE FAIR 

938
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,071
TO THE REPUBLICAN. 

939
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,239
>> I THINK WE SHOULD, TOO. 

940
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,240
>> SENATOR TILLIS? 

941
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,176
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

942
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,711
MR. CHAIRMAN, I TOOK NEARLY 17 

943
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,246
YEARS TO GET MY COLLEGE DEGREE. 

944
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:44,048
I WENT TO FIVE DIFFERENT 

945
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:44,949
INSTITUTIONS THAT I'M PRETTY 

946
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,051
SURE NONE HAVE BEEN ELEVATED TO 

947
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,053
THE IVY LEAGUE. 

948
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,421
THAT'S RIGHT. 

949
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,090
I DON'T EVER PLAN ON RUNNING 

950
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,092
FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020 OR ANY 

951
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,393
POINT IN THE FUTURE. I 

952
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,394
WANT TO MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT 

953
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,264
AND ONE REQUEST. 

954
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:03,001
THE COMMENT, AS I HOPE 

955
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:03,701
EVERYBODY WILL RECORD A 

956
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,571
TRANSCRIPT OF WHAT IS GOING ON 

957
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,071
RIGHT NOW. 

958
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,439
SENATOR LEE EXPLAINS THINGS, I 

959
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,308
THINK, AND ELOQUENT LEGAL TERMS 

960
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,310
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 

961
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,444
CONSEQUENCES OF MAKING THIS AN 

962
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:14,245
UN-TRUSTED BODY TO RECEIVE 

963
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,313
DOCUMENTS UNDER THE 

964
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,014
PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT. 

965
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,283
YOU MAY RUE THE DAY THAT YOU DO 

966
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,317
THAT BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY WILL 

967
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,618
GET FEWER DOCUMENTS IN THE 

968
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,352
FUTURE. 

969
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:25,089
NOW, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO, 

970
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,057
IS ASK ALL OF OUR MEMBERS, 

971
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:26,824
PERHAPS WE CAN ACTUALLY 

972
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:27,892
DEMONSTRATE TO THE AMERICAN 

973
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:32,931
PEOPLE THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO 

974
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:33,464
EXPOSE OUR OWN RECORDS. I 

975
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,699
WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST FOR THE 

976
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,400
PURPOSES OF THE SCOTUS 

977
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,369
NOMINATION THAT ALL OF US WAIVE 

978
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,272
ANY RIGHT TO THE SPEECH AND 

979
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,074
DEBATE CLAUSE AND THAT WE ALLOW 

980
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,142
ALL OF OUR EMAIL RECORDS 

981
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:44,876
RELATED TO THIS SCOTUS 

982
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,077
NOMINATION TO BE MADE PUBLIC ON 

983
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,845
AN IMMEDIATE BASIS. 

984
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,681
I, FOR ONE, AND READY TO SIGN 

985
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,717
UP FOR IT NOW AND I HOPE THE 

986
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,419
OTHER MEMBERS WILL DO THE SAME 

987
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:54,652
THING. 

988
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,120
IN THE INTEREST OF 

989
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,720
TRANSPARENCY, CERTAINLY, IT 

990
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,523
WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR EVERYONE 

991
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:58,756
OF US. 

992
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,158
REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE WANT TO 

993
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,392
DO IN THE FUTURE, TO EXPOSE 

994
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,760
THAT INFORMATION TO THE 

995
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,896
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

996
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:09,467
>> ARE YOU DONE? 

997
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,435
I WILL START WITH MY 

998
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:10,768
QUESTIONING. 

999
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,270
BY THE WAY, WE ARE GOING TO 

1000
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,373
HAVE TO -- SO EVERYBODY GETS AN 

1001
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:21,346
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE FBI 

1002
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,014
AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO 

1003
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,650
ASK -- AT 1:00, WE GO INTO 

1004
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,684
EXECUTIVE SESSION AND GET THAT 

1005
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,920
DONE BEFORE, IF THE SENATE DOES 

1006
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,256
CLOSE DOWN AT 2:00. I 

1007
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,457
MEAN, IF THEY DON'T GIVE US 

1008
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,758
PERMISSION TO MEET AFTER 2:00. 

1009
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,027
WE'VE GOT TO GET THAT OUT OF THE

1010
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,062
WAY AND WE WILL DO THAT AT 

1011
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:38,463
1:00. 

1012
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,498
>> MAY I JUST -- 

1013
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,532
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, DID YOU YIELD 

1014
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:46,037
A QUESTION ABOUT PROCEDURE? 

1015
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,072
>> I USED THE WRONG WORD, 

1016
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:48,305
CLOSED. 

1017
00:31:48,305 --> 00:31:58,316
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT -- CLOSED 

1018
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,449
INSTEAD OF EXECUTIVE SESSION. 

1019
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:01,352
>> WOULD YOU YIELD TO A 

1020
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,420
QUESTION ABOUT PROCEDURE, MR. 

1021
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:02,686
CHAIRMAN? 

1022
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:03,020
>> GO AHEAD. 

1023
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,658
>> YOU EXPLAINED WHY WE ARE 

1024
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:10,061
HAVING TO TRUNCATE THE HEARING 

1025
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:10,294
TODAY? 

1026
00:32:10,294 --> 00:32:11,729
>> I'M NOT SURE WE DO HAVE TO 

1027
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:12,062
TRUNCATE IT. 

1028
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:13,564
JUST IN CASE, IT WOULD BE 

1029
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:19,871
BECAUSE THE MINORITY MAY OBJECT 

1030
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,005
TO THE UNANIMOUS CONSENT 

1031
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:21,272
REQUEST. 

1032
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,340
THE LEADER WOULD MAKE IT FOR 

1033
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,275
THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO 

1034
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:27,045
WORK WHILE THE SENATE IS IN 

1035
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:27,312
SESSION. 

1036
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,946
>> LET ME BE SURE I UNDERSTAND. 

1037
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:33,151
SENATOR SCHUMER IS SAYING THAT 

1038
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,919
WE HAVE TO SHUT DOWN WHILE THE 

1039
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,253
SENATE IS IN SESSION? 

1040
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:38,723
DO WE NOT GENERALLY WAIVE THAT 

1041
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,223
RULE? 

1042
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,024
>> YES. 

1043
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:40,557
GENERALLY, IT IS WAIVED. 

1044
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:41,959
IF SUBJECTED TO IT, WE CAN'T 

1045
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,159
MEET. 

1046
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,294
THAT MEANS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE 

1047
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:51,669
<u>URE THAT WE GET THE EXECUTI </u>

1048
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,771
-- THE CLOSED SESSION OUT OF 

1049
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:54,037
THE WAY. 

1050
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:55,907
>> MAY I ASK WHY SENATOR 

1051
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,976
SCHUMER IS DOING THAT? 

1052
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,776
>> I DON'T KNOW. 

1053
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,079
>> WE HAVE A NOMINEE TO THE 

1054
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,480
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED 

1055
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:02,713
STATES. 

1056
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:03,881
WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT 

1057
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:04,214
TRANSPARENCY. 

1058
00:33:04,214 --> 00:33:05,483
WHAT IS HIS BASIS FOR DOING 

1059
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:05,683
THAT? 

1060
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,485
>> YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK HIM. I 

1061
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,954
DON'T KNOW. 

1062
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,056
>> IF I MAY, I WOULD JUST LIKE 

1063
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:15,293
TO PUT A DOCUMENT IN THE RECORD 

1064
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,527
THAT THE COMMITTEE WAS TOLD 

1065
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,762
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 

1066
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,864
DECIDED TO WITHHOLD 102 PAGES 

1067
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,466
OF KAVANAUGH'S WHITE HOUSE 

1068
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:26,471
COUNSEL RECORDS. 

1069
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:26,738
102,000. 

1070
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:33,544
WHAT DID I SAY? 

1071
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,180
>> THANK YOU. 

1072
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,348
102,000 PAGES OF KAVANAUGH'S 

1073
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,516
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL RECORDS AND 

1074
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,718
ASSERTED A NEW CLAIM OF 

1075
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:41,285
CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE. 

1076
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,021
OF COURSE, THAT HASN'T BEEN 

1077
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,356
DONE BEFORE AND I'M TOLD THERE 

1078
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,725
IS NO SUCH PRIVILEGE. 

1079
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,494
THERE IS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, 

1080
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,628
OUTLINED IN PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS

1081
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,230
AND REQUIRES THE PRESIDENT TO 

1082
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,964
NOTIFY CONGRESS AND THE 

1083
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,232
ARCHIVIST, WHICH WAS NOT DONE 

1084
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:58,102
HERE. THERE IS A LITTLE BIT 

1085
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,505
MORE TO IT BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT 

1086
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:00,938
THAT IN THE RECORD. 

1087
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:01,939
>> WITHOUT OBJECTION, THAT WILL 

1088
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,976
BE PUT IN THE RECORD. 

1089
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,978
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WE'VE HEARD A 

1090
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,146
LOT YESTERDAY ABOUT YOUR RECORD 

1091
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:08,846
OF INDEPENDENCE AND 

1092
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:09,179
IMPARTIALITY. 

1093
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,447
YOU'VE DONE MORE THAN TALK 

1094
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:16,254
ABOUT YOUR INDEPENDENCE AND 

1095
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,455
IMPARTIALITY, YOU'VE 

1096
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,123
DEMONSTRATED JUDICIAL VALUES OF 

1097
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,492
THE BENCH BY MY ACCOUNT, YOU 

1098
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:22,293
RULED AGAINST EXECUTIVE BRANCH 

1099
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,226
AGENCIES 23 TIMES BETWEEN MAY 

1100
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:29,199
2006, JANUARY 2009. 

1101
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,268
OF COURSE, PRESIDENT BUSH WAS 

1102
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:34,371
NOMINATED -- WHO NOMINATED YOU 

1103
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:37,007
TO THE BENCH, WAS THE HEAD OF 

1104
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:37,475
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 

1105
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,043
YOU HAD NO PROBLEMS RULING 

1106
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:39,944
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT WHO 

1107
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:40,311
APPOINTED YOU. 

1108
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,411
IF THAT'S WHAT THE LAW ARE 

1109
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:41,779
REQUIRED. I 

1110
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:46,784
HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU WOULD DO 

1111
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,319
THE SAME ON THE SUPREME COURT 

1112
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,554
IF THAT'S WHAT THE LAW 

1113
00:34:50,554 --> 00:34:51,155
REQUIRED. 

1114
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:51,588
YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED 

1115
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:51,922
IMPARTIALITY. 

1116
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:53,491
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TRIED TO 

1117
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,092
DEPICT YOU AS HOSTILE TO THE 

1118
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,194
LITTLE GUY AND ALWAYS WILLING 

1119
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,127
TO RULE FOR THE POWERFUL. 

1120
00:34:57,127 --> 00:35:00,431
YOUR RECORD SHOWS THAT YOU RULE 

1121
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,565
FOR THE PARTY THAT HAS THE LAW 

1122
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:02,300
ON THEIR SIDE. 

1123
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:08,239
SO, THAT MAKES YOU OUT TO BE NOT

1124
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,607
A PRO PLAINTIFF JUDGE OR PRO-

1125
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:11,208
DEFENDANT JUDGE. 

1126
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,777
BUT, TO BE A PRO LAW JUDGE. 

1127
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:15,880
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT A FEW OF 

1128
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,382
YOUR CASES THAT I THINK 

1129
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,817
DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU WILL 

1130
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,418
VINDICATE THE RIGHTS OF THOSE 

1131
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:24,788
WHO ARE LESS POWERFUL IN OUR 

1132
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:25,423
SOCIETY. 

1133
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,257
AFTER ALL OUR ASPIRATIONS AS 

1134
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:26,990
AMERICANS, IT'S EQUAL JUSTICE. 

1135
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:42,874
EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. 

1136
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:50,815
>> SHAME! SHAME! 

1137
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,650
>> SO, I WILL ASK YOU ON EACH 

1138
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,851
ONE OF THEM, BUT JUST SO YOU 

1139
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,319
KNOW, THE THREE CASES I'M 

1140
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:59,490
THINKING ABOUT HIS RUE ZELLO, 

1141
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,058
ESSEX INSURANCE AND UNITED FOOD 

1142
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,427
AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS. 

1143
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:06,097
IN THE FIRST ONE, THE CASE IN 

1144
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,798
WHICH YOU RULED FOR THE WOMEN 

1145
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:08,331
WRONGFULLY DENIED SOCIAL 

1146
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:09,032
SECURITY BENEFITS, TELL US YOUR 

1147
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:14,872
APPROACH TO THAT CASE? 

1148
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:15,906
>> THIS CASE, MR. CHAIRMAN, WAS 

1149
00:36:15,906 --> 00:36:16,773
A CASE IN WHICH THE SOCIAL 

1150
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:17,575
SECURITY ADMINISTRATION HAD 

1151
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:45,069
DENIED BENEFITS. 

1152
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,804
>> THERE IS A CASE WHERE THE 

1153
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:47,438
SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 

1154
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,639
DENIED BENEFITS TO A WOMAN WHO 

1155
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,473
HAD THE HISTORY OF MENTAL 

1156
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,341
ILLNESS AND THEY DID SO BECAUSE 

1157
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:55,246
AT ONE POINT IN TIME, SHE HAD 

1158
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,647
BEEN EMPLOYED FOR A BRIEF 

1159
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,350
PERIOD OF TIME WITH A FAMILY 

1160
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,153
MEMBER BUT IT HAD BEEN 

1161
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:02,453
SUBSIDIZED. 

1162
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:05,122
IN MY VIEW, THIS WAS THE HEIGHT 

1163
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:05,722
OF ARBITRARY DECISION-MAKING. 

1164
00:37:05,722 --> 00:37:07,124
THE CASE HAD GONE ON FOR 15 

1165
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,291
YEARS, IT WAS A HALL OF MIRRORS 

1166
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:09,826
FOR THE WOMAN AND I WROTE AN 

1167
00:37:09,826 --> 00:37:16,100
OPINION REVERSING THE DENIAL OF 

1168
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,735
BENEFITS FOR THE WOMAN AND ALSO 

1169
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,970
MAKING CLEAR TO THE SOCIAL 

1170
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,838
SECURITY ADMINISTRATION THAT 

1171
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,907
ANY FURTHER DELAY WOULD NOT BE 

1172
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,674
TOLERATED AND THAT THESE KINDS 

1173
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:24,609
OF DELAYS IN DENYING BENEFITS 

1174
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:25,977
WITH PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS 

1175
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:26,410
WERE UNACCEPTABLE. 

1176
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,445
>> 'S -- 

1177
00:37:28,445 --> 00:37:31,015
>> LET'S GO WITH THE ESSEX 

1178
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:39,357
INSURANCE COMPANY. 

1179
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:47,999
IN THE ESSEX CASE, IT WAS THE 

1180
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,133
CASE OF A CHILD, FAMILY AND AN 

1181
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,000
INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE CHILD 

1182
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,435
HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL 

1183
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,205
ABUSE ON THREE OCCASIONS AND 

1184
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,139
THE INSURANCE COMPANY WAS 

1185
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:58,275
TRYING TO PAY OUT SIMPLY 

1186
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:05,249
$100,000 FOR THE TOTAL NUMBER 

1187
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,817
FOR THE ABUSE. 

1188
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:07,718
AND THE INSURANCE POLICY SAID 

1189
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:08,786
$100,000 FOR EACH OCCURRENCE, 

1190
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:13,057
IN ESSENCE. 

1191
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:13,690
WE RULED THAT THE INSURANCE 

1192
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,226
COMPANY HAD TO PAY $100,000 FOR 

1193
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:19,530
EACH OCCURRENCE, EACH INCIDENT 

1194
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,398
OF THE ABUSE AND THEREFORE, A 

1195
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:20,964
TOTAL OF $300,000. 

1196
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:29,640
IN THAT CASE, THE RULES, FOR 

1197
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,741
THE VICTIM OF ABUSE AGAINST THE 

1198
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:31,642
INSURANCE COMPANY THAT WAS 

1199
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,309
SEEKING TO SQUEEZE THE BENEFITS 

1200
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,544
THAT WERE PAID UNDER A POLICY 

1201
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:38,616
THAT WAS OWED TO THE PLAINTIFF 

1202
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:42,019
IN THE CASE. 

1203
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,220
>> THE UNITED FOOD AND 

1204
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,687
COMMERCIAL WORKERS? 

1205
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:47,625
>> THAT IS THE UNION CASE 

1206
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,526
AGAINST WALMART AND THE CASE 

1207
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:55,199
CAME FROM THE NLRB IN THE CASE 

1208
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:55,833
WAS WHETHER WALMART HAD ENGAGED 

1209
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,499
IN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES 

1210
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:57,535
AGAINST A UNION, IN THAT CASE 

1211
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:02,072
AND IN THAT CASE, WE RULED FOR 

1212
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:02,940
THE UNION AGAINST WALMART IN 

1213
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,008
THAT CASE, ON THE GROUND THAT 

1214
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:11,148
THE FACTUAL RECORD SUPPORTED 

1215
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:14,051
THE CONCLUSION THAT THE COMPANY 

1216
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,053
HAD ENGAGED IN UNFAIR LABOR 

1217
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,288
PRACTICES AND THEREFORE 

1218
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,490
VIOLATED THE RIGHTS OF THE 

1219
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:19,857
UNION MEMBERS. 

1220
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,459
>> NOW, TO SOMETHING I BELIEVED 

1221
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,059
I'VE DISCUSSED WITH EVERY 

1222
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:22,893
NOMINEE TO THE SUPREME COURT 

1223
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:31,268
PROBABLY FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. 

1224
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,369
IT'S NOT ABOUT A CASE OR YOUR 

1225
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,504
APPROACH TO THE LAW AND IT'S 

1226
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,138
SOMETHING THAT SENATOR KENNEDY 

1227
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:37,408
TALKED TO YOU ABOUT YESTERDAY. 

1228
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,242
IT ISN'T A VERY POPULAR SUBJECT 

1229
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,142
WITH SOME OF THE CURRENT AND 

1230
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:40,110
FORMER JUSTICES. 

1231
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:47,051
I THINK I MAKE CHIEF JUSTICE 

1232
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:47,818
ROBERTS UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN I 

1233
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:48,785
AISE THIS ISSUE WHEN I SPEA 

1234
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:49,452
WITH THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE 

1235
00:39:49,452 --> 00:39:56,626
AND THERE WAS WHEN JUSTICE 

1236
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:58,462
SOUTER WAS ON THE SUPREME 

1237
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,965
COURT, HE MADE A FAMOUS QUIP 

1238
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:01,832
ABOUT TELEVISION CAMERAS THAT 

1239
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:02,933
THEY WOULD HAVE TO ROLL OVER 

1240
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:03,300
HIS DEAD BODY. 

1241
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,435
I COULD RESPECT THAT VIEW. 

1242
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:07,772
I THINK IT'S PLAIN WRONG. 

1243
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:08,706
I AND MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES 

1244
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:13,777
BELIEVE THAT ALLOWING CAMERAS 

1245
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:15,346
IN THEIR COURT WOULD ALLOW 

1246
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,248
COURTS TO THE PUBLIC AND BRING 

1247
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,582
ABOUT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF 

1248
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,917
THE COURT AND ITS WORK. 

1249
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,018
YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT FOR A 

1250
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:22,319
NUMBER OF YEARS, I'VE SPONSORED 

1251
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:28,559
A BILL, THE SUNSHINE IN THE 

1252
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,527
COURTROOM ACT WHICH GIVES 

1253
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,394
JUDGES THE DISCRETION TO ALLOW 

1254
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,563
MEDIA COVERAGE OF FEDERAL COURT 

1255
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:32,896
PROCEEDINGS. 

1256
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:34,965
WOULD YOU KEEP AN OPEN MIND ON 

1257
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,167
CAMERAS IN THE COURTROOM, OR IF 

1258
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:39,970
YOU HAVE STRONGLY HELD VIEWS ON 

1259
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:40,136
IT? 

1260
00:40:40,136 --> 00:40:41,672
DON'T BE AFRAID TO TELL ME. 

1261
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,007
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I APPRECIATE 

1262
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,240
YOUR LONG-STANDING INTEREST IN 

1263
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,342
THE ISSUE AND TRANSPARENCY 

1264
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,543
WHERE THE COURTS, OF COURSE. 

1265
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:48,913
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE'VE DONE 

1266
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,748
ON MY COURT, BRIEFLY AND THEN 

1267
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,549
TELL YOU SOME GENERAL THOUGHTS, 

1268
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:54,551
GOING FORWARD, IF I WOULD BE 

1269
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:54,851
CONFIRMED. 

1270
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:56,053
ON OUR COURT, WE'VE GONE FROM 

1271
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,722
AUDIO RELEASE AT SOME DATE MUCH 

1272
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,257
LATER AND THEN WE WENT TO AUDIO 

1273
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:04,395
RELEASE THE SAME WEEK AND THEN 

1274
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,396
WE WENT TO AUDIO RELEASE THE 

1275
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:10,601
SAME DAY AND NOW, WE ARE 

1276
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,703
ALLOWING AUDIO TO GO OUT LIVE 

1277
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:13,403
WITH THE ORAL ARGUMENTS. 

1278
00:41:13,403 --> 00:41:14,204
THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN ONE IN 

1279
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:15,439
WHICH THE JUDGES HAVE LEARNED 

1280
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,674
EXPERIENCE WITH ADDITIONAL 

1281
00:41:17,674 --> 00:41:21,912
TRANSPARENCY WITH AUDIO OVER 

1282
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,814
TIME. 

1283
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:30,921
THAT PROCESS HAS WORKED WELL IN 

1284
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:31,221
OUR COURT. 

1285
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:31,889
THE SUPREME COURT, THE BEST 

1286
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:38,262
APPROACH FOR ME IS TO LISTEN TO 

1287
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,063
THE VIEWS OF PEOPLE LIKE 

1288
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:39,797
YOURSELF, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 

1289
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:40,830
OTHERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN 

1290
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,066
THAT, TO LEARN, IF I WERE TO BE 

1291
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:46,236
CONFIRMED FROM THE EXPERIENCE 

1292
00:41:46,236 --> 00:41:47,671
THEY ARE AND THE EXPERIENCE 

1293
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:56,980
THAT IS LIKE. 

1294
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,116
TO BE PART OF A TEAM, I'D WANT 

1295
00:42:00,116 --> 00:42:00,885
 

1296
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,119
JUSTICES WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT 

1297
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:02,319
THIS. 

1298
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,220
SEVERAL, AS YOU KNOW WELL, MR. 

1299
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,855
CHAIRMAN, WHEN THEY ARE IN MY 

1300
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:11,528
SEAT, THEY EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR 

1301
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:12,496
ORAL ARGUMENTS AND WHEN THEY 

1302
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:15,298
WERE THERE FOR A FEW YEARS, 

1303
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:17,267
SWITCHED AFTER EXPERIENCING IT. 

1304
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:20,571
I'D WANT TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT 

1305
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:20,771
THAT. 

1306
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,705
AS I SAID TO SENATOR KENNEDY, 

1307
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:24,841
I'D WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE 

1308
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:25,341
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ORAL 

1309
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,944
ARGUMENT AND THE ACTUAL 

1310
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,679
ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE DECISIONS. 

1311
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,113
THOSE ARE TWO DISTINCT THINGS 

1312
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:32,416
AND THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH 

1313
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,284
FOCUS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF 

1314
00:42:34,284 --> 00:42:34,985
LIVE AUDIO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 

1315
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:35,652
DECISION ANNOUNCEMENTS OR VIDEO 

1316
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:44,395
OF THE DECISION ANNOUNCEMENTS. 

1317
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,895
I'D BE INTERESTED IN THINKING 

1318
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:47,097
ABOUT THAT IN TALKING TO MY 

1319
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,265
COLLEAGUES IF I WERE CONFIRMED. 

1320
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,901
I'D HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND I DO 

1321
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,770
THINK WHEN YOU ATTEND AN ORAL 

1322
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,571
ARGUMENT WITH THE SUPREME COURT 

1323
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:55,605
AS I HAVE MANY TIMES OR ATTEND 

1324
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:56,306
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF DECISIONS, 

1325
00:42:56,306 --> 00:42:57,508
IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPRESSIVE 

1326
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:04,715
TO WALK INTO THAT BUILDING AND 

1327
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,149
THE MAJESTY OF THAT BUILDING, 

1328
00:43:06,149 --> 00:43:06,917
THE BUILDING, ITSELF, CONVEYS 

1329
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,318
THE STABILITY AND MAJESTY OF 

1330
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,057
THE LAW. 

1331
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,191
AND, TO GO INTO THE COURTROOM 

1332
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:18,162
AND TO SEE THE JUSTICES WORKING 

1333
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,195
TOGETHER AS THEY RESOLVE CASES, 

1334
00:43:19,195 --> 00:43:20,164
IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY 

1335
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:29,740
IMPRESSIVE. 

1336
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,808
TO SEE THEM IN ACTION, I DO 

1337
00:43:31,808 --> 00:43:37,147
UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT OF VIEW 

1338
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,949
ON THIS AND I WOULD CERTAINLY 

1339
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,851
KEEP AN OPEN MIND ON IT AND 

1340
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,019
LISTEN TO YOU AND LISTEN TO THE 

1341
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,019
OTHER JUSTICES ON THE COURT, OF 

1342
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:43,253
COURSE. 

1343
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:46,924
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 

1344
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:52,262
I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO ROE. 

1345
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,530
BECAUSE, MOST OF US LOOK AT YOU 

1346
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:59,637
AS THE DECIDING VOTE. 

1347
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,804
I ASKED YESTERDAY IF YOUR VIEWS 

1348
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,873
ON ROE HAVE CHANGED SINCE YOU 

1349
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,875
WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1350
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,543
YOU SAID SOMETHING TO THE 

1351
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,545
EFFECT THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW 

1352
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:09,646
WHAT I MEANT TO. 

1353
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:11,715
WE HAVE AN EMAIL THAT WAS 

1354
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:12,882
PREVIOUSLY MARKED CONFIDENTIAL, 

1355
00:44:12,882 --> 00:44:13,617
BUT IS NOW PUBLIC. 

1356
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:14,718
IT SHOWS THAT YOU ASKED ABOUT 

1357
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:17,855
MAKING EDITS TO AN OP-ED THAT 

1358
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,723
READ THE FOLLOWING -- AND I 

1359
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,191
QUOTE -- FIRST OF ALL, IT IS 

1360
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,794
WIDELY UNDERSTOOD, ACCEPTED BY 

1361
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:24,394
LEGAL SCHOLARS ACROSS THE 

1362
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:25,628
BOARD, THAT ROE V. WADE AND ITS 

1363
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:28,365
PROGENY ARE THE SETTLED LAW OF 

1364
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:34,571
THE LAND. YOU RESPONDED BY 

1365
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,573
SAYING, AND I QUOTE, I'M NOT 

1366
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:41,545
SURE THAT ALL LEGAL SCHOLARS 

1367
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,947
REFER TO ROE AS THE SETTLED LAW 

1368
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,716
OF THE LAND AT THE SUPREME 

1369
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:46,450
COURT LEVEL SINCE COURT CAN 

1370
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:51,055
ALWAYS OVERRULE ITS PRECEDENT 

1371
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,156
AND THREE CURRENT JUSTICES ON 

1372
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,022
THE COURT WOULD DO SO. 

1373
00:44:53,022 --> 00:44:54,191
THIS HAS BEEN VIEWED AS YOU 

1374
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,993
SAYING THAT YOU DON'T THINK ROE 

1375
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:56,659
IS SETTLED. 

1376
00:44:56,659 --> 00:45:04,601
I RECOGNIZE THE WORD SAID IS 

1377
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:05,201
WHAT LEGAL SCHOLARS REFER TO. 

1378
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:05,902
PLEASE, ONCE AGAIN, TELL US WHY 

1379
00:45:05,902 --> 00:45:13,677
YOU BELIEVE ROE IS SETTLED LAW. 

1380
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,379
IF YOU COULD, DO YOU BELIEVE IT 

1381
00:45:16,379 --> 00:45:18,382
IS CORRECTLY SETTLED? 

1382
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,150
>> SO, THANK YOU SENATOR 

1383
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:20,450
FEINSTEIN. 

1384
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:21,385
IN THAT DRAFT LETTER, IT WAS 

1385
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:26,890
REFERRING TO THE VIEWS OF LEGAL 

1386
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,724
SCHOLARS. 

1387
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:30,160
I THINK MY COMMENT IN THE EMAIL 

1388
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,128
IS THAT MIGHT BE OVERSTATING 

1389
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,329
THE POSITION OF LEGAL SCHOLARS 

1390
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,530
AND IT WASN'T A TECHNICALLY 

1391
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:39,403
ACCURATE DESCRIPTION IN WHAT 

1392
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,470
LEGAL SCHOLARS THOUGHT AT THAT 

1393
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,305
TIME. I 

1394
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,573
BELIEVE CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST 

1395
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,941
AND JUSTICE SCALIA WERE STILL 

1396
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:47,044
ON THE COURT, AT THAT TIME. 

1397
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,645
THE BROADER POINT WAS SIMPLY 

1398
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:52,049
THAT I THINK IT WAS OVERSTATING 

1399
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,117
SOMETHING ABOUT LEGAL SCHOLARS 

1400
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,218
AND I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED WITH 

1401
00:45:55,218 --> 00:45:55,485
ACCURACY. 

1402
00:45:55,485 --> 00:45:58,222
I THOUGHT THAT WAS NOT QUITE 

1403
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,223
THE ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF ALL 

1404
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,090
LEGAL SCHOLARS BECAUSE IT 

1405
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:00,490
REFERRED TO ALL. 

1406
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,359
TO YOUR BROADER POINT, ROE V. 

1407
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:08,131
WADE IS AN IMPORTANT PRECEDENCE 

1408
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:10,868
OF THE SUPREME COURT IN THE 

1409
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,036
HOOD HAS BEEN REAFFIRMED MANY 

1410
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:13,537
TIMES. 

1411
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:14,938
IT WAS REAFFIRMED IN PLANNED 

1412
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,907
PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY IN 1992 

1413
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:17,740
WHEN THE COURT SPECIFICALLY 

1414
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,474
CONSIDERED WHETHER TO REAFFIRM 

1415
00:46:18,474 --> 00:46:22,746
IT OR WHETHER TO OVERTURN IT. 

1416
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:26,083
IN THAT CASE, AND GREAT DETAIL, 

1417
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:29,019
THE THREE JUSTICE'S OPINIONS OF 

1418
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,154
JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE 

1419
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:32,522
O'CONNOR AND JUSTICE KENNEDY 

1420
00:46:32,522 --> 00:46:33,189
WENT THROUGH ALL THE FACTORS, 

1421
00:46:33,189 --> 00:46:33,991
ANALYZED THOSE AND DECIDED TO 

1422
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:34,825
REAFFIRM ROLE. 

1423
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:39,829
THAT MAKES KC PRECEDENT ON 

1424
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:40,764
PRECEDENT AND IT'S BEEN RELIED 

1425
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,366
ON AND CITED AS AUTHORITY AND 

1426
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:47,037
SUBSEQUENT CASES. 

1427
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:47,938
THAT PRECEDENT IS QUITE 

1428
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:56,446
IMPORTANT AS YOU THINK ABOUT 

1429
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,682
STARE DECISIS IN THIS CONTEXT. A

1430
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,084
SIMILAR ANALOGY, THE U.S. VERSUS

1431
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:02,719
DICKERSON CASE IN 2000 WHERE 

1432
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:03,620
THE COURT CONSIDERED WHETHER TO 

1433
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,287
OVERTURN MIRANDA VERSUS ARIZONA 

1434
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:10,127
OR TO REAFFIRM IT. 

1435
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,396
IN THAT CASE, THE COURT THROUGH 

1436
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:13,530
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, 

1437
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,398
SPECIFICALLY, REAFFIRMED 

1438
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:15,232
MARANDA DESPITE THE FACT THAT 

1439
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:17,167
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST HAD 

1440
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,435
BEEN A CRITIC OF MIRANDA IN THE 

1441
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,269
EARLY DAYS AND HAD WRITTEN SOME 

1442
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:23,207
OPINIONS QUITE CRITICAL OF IT. 

1443
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:23,974
THE DICKERSON CASE IS SIMILARLY 

1444
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:29,746
PRECEDENT ON PRECEDENT, WHICH 

1445
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:30,413
IS IMPORTANT, GOING FORWARD, AS 

1446
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:31,147
YOU THINK ABOUT THE STARE 

1447
00:47:31,147 --> 00:47:32,616
DECISIS CALCULATION FOR A CASE 

1448
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:41,358
LIKE MIRANDA. 

1449
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,292
THAT'S WHY BOTH OF THOSE CASES, 

1450
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:44,394
PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY 

1451
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,263
AND DICKERSON ARE CASES THAT I 

1452
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:47,463
REFER TO AS PRESIDENT ON 

1453
00:47:47,463 --> 00:47:48,165
PRECEDENT. 

1454
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,833
>> SO, YOU BELIEVE IT IS 

1455
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:50,600
CORRECTLY SETTLED, BUT IS IT 

1456
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,435
CORRECT LAW IN YOUR VIEW? 

1457
00:47:51,435 --> 00:48:01,745
>> SENATOR, ON THAT CASE OR ON

SEAT BEFORE HAVE DONE. 

1465
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:17,026
>> JUDGE, A YES OR NO WILL DO. 

1466
00:48:17,026 --> 00:48:18,729
>> JUSTIFY COULD BRIEFLY 

1467

EXPLAIN -- 

1468
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:19,896
>> YES, YOU CAN. 

1469
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,566
>> A WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF. 

1470
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,167
WHEN YOU ARE IN THIS SEAT, I'M 

1471
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,470
NOT JUST SITTING HERE FOR 

1472
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,105
MYSELF, I SIT HERE IS A 

1473
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,840
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE JUDICIARY 

1474
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,073
AND THE OBLIGATION TO PRESERVE 

1475
00:48:31,073 --> 00:48:32,776
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE 

1476
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:34,411
JUDICIARY, WHICH I KNOW YOU 

1477
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:34,911
CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. 

1478
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,547
WHAT I'VE DONE IS STUDY VERY 

1479
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,816
CAREFULLY WHAT NOMINEES HAVE 

1480
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,385
DONE IN THE PAST. I 

1481
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,921

1482
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:44,221
PRECEDENT. 

1483
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:45,222
JUSTICE GINSBURG AND ALL THE 

1484
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,456
JUSTICES HAVE NOT GIVEN HINTS 

1485
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:47,490
OR FORECASTS OR PREVIEWS. 

1486
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,259
JUSTICE KAGAN, I THINK, 

1487
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,261
CAPTURED IT WELL, AS SHE OFTEN 

1488
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,796
DOES, IN TALKING ABOUT 

1489
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,464
QUESTIONS LIKE THAT WHEN YOU 

1490
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:54,764
ARE ASKING. 

1491
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:56,967
YOU CAN'T GIVE A THUMBS-UP OR 

1492
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,935
THUMBS DOWN AND MAINTAIN THE 

1493
00:48:58,935 --> 00:48:59,903
INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. 

1494
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,105
I NEED TO FOLLOW THAT NOMINEE 

1495
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:02,873
PRECEDENT HERE. 

1496
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:04,908

>> I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT. 

1504
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,351
THANK YOU. 

1505
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:18,221
DURING HER TIME IN THE BUSH 

1506
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,023
WHITE HOUSE, THE ADMINISTRATION 

1507
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,559
ACTIVELY TOOK STEPS TO LIMIT 

1508
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,459
WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES 

1509
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:25,662
INCLUDING REIMPOSING THE GLOBAL 

1510
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,898
GAG RULE TO PREVENT FOREIGN 

1511
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:28,965
ORGANIZATIONS FROM SPENDING 

1512
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:31,067
THEIR OWN MONEY ON REPRODUCTIVE 

1513
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:35,104
HEALTH AND TRYING TO PREVENT 

1514
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:36,005
THE FDA FROM MAKING PLAN B 

1515
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:37,007
CONTRACEPTION AVAILABLE OVER-

1516
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:37,340
THE-COUNTER. 

1517
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,341
DURING YOUR SERVICE AT THE 

1518
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:43,880
WHITE HOUSE, 2001-2006, DID YOU 

1519
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,648
WORK ON ANY ISSUES RELATED TO 

1520
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,149
WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OR 

1521
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:46,817
CHOICE? 

1522
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,152
>> PRESIDENT BUSH WAS A PRO-

1523
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:58,228
LIFE PRESIDENT. 'S POLICY WAS 

1524
00:49:58,228 --> 00:49:59,128
PRO-LIFE AND THOSE WHO WORKED 

1525
00:49:59,128 --> 00:49:59,996
FOR HIM, THEREFORE, HAD TO 

1526
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:06,870
ASSIST HIM, OF COURSE, WHEN 

1527
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:07,403
PURSUING THOSE POLICIES, 

1528
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:07,937
REGULATORY, PARTIAL-BIRTH 

1529
00:50:07,937 --> 00:50:11,208
LEGISLATOR'S ELATION THAT WAS 

1530
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,843
PASSED. 

1531
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,777
SOME OF THOSE THINGS MIGHT HAVE 

1532
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:20,484
CROSSED MY DESK. 

1533
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:21,918
I CAN'T REMEMBER SPECIFICS. 

1534
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:22,885
I THINK THIS CAME UP IN JUSTICE 

1535
00:50:22,885 --> 00:50:24,187
KAGAN, WHEN SHE WORKED FOR 

1536
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,423
PRESIDENT CLINTON, HE HAD A 

1537
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:27,157
DIFFERENT VIEW THAN PRESIDENT 

1538
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:31,595
BUSH ON THAT ISSUE AND SHE HAD 

1539
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:32,262
SOME WORK FOR PRESIDENT 

1540
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:32,529
CLINTON. 

1541
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,563
I CONSIDER MYSELF WORKING FOR 

1542
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:37,267
PRESIDENT BUSH, I WAS THERE TO 

1543
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:37,567
ASSIST HIM. 

1544
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:44,074
>> LET ME GO TO TORTURE. 

1545
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,943
DURING THE TIME YOU WORKED IN 

1546
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:49,079
THE WHITE HOUSE, THE OFFICE OF 

1547
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:49,746
LEGAL COUNSEL CONCLUDED THAT 

1548
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,314
HARSH INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES 

1549
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:51,981
WERE ILLEGAL, EVEN THOUGH 

1550
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:53,517
CONGRESS HAD PASSED A LAW IN 

1551
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:59,489
1994 BANNING TORTURE. 

1552
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:00,657
THE OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL 

1553
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:02,592
TOOK A SWEEPING VIEW OF 

1554
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,061
PRESIDENTIAL POWER AND CONCLUDED

1555
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,763
THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD 

1556
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:07,230
OVERRIDE THE STATUTE. 

1557
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,434
IN RESPONSE, IN 2005, CONGRESS 

1558
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,903
ADOPTED AN AMENDMENT CHAMPIONED 

1559
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,571
BY OUR COLLEAGUE, SENATOR 

1560
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,205
McCAIN. I 

1561
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,273
WAS A COSPONSOR. 

1562
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,341
IT STATED THAT ONLY 

1563
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:19,476
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES THAT 

1564
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,344
CAN BE USED ARE THOSE 

1565
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:22,279
AUTHORIZED IN THE ARMY FIELD 

1566
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:22,512
MANUAL. 

1567
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:23,713
WAS THE OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL 

1568
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:30,387
CORRECT WHEN IT CONCLUDED THAT 

1569
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,455
THE PRESIDENT COULD IGNORE THE 

1570
00:51:32,455 --> 00:51:32,788
TORTURE BAN? 

1571
00:51:32,788 --> 00:51:33,656
>> THE OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL, 

1572
00:51:33,656 --> 00:51:34,324
SENATOR, SUBSEQUENTLY WITHDREW 

1573
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:39,930
THOSE MEMOS, AS YOU KNOW. 

1574
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,531
AS I'VE MADE CLEAR IN SOME OF 

1575
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,634
MY WRITINGS, THE REVIEW OF 

1576
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,903
JUDGE DAVID BEHRENS' BOOK, SOME 

1577
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:49,739
OF MY OPINIONS, AS WELL, THE 

1578
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:50,407
PRESIDENT DOES NOT HAVE THE 

1579
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:51,074
AUTHORITY TO DISREGARD STATUTES 

1580
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,442
PASSED BY CONGRESS REGULATING 

1581
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:58,648
THE WAR EFFORT EXCEPT IN 

1582
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,016
CERTAIN VERY NARROWLY DESCRIBED 

1583
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:00,950
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE 

1584
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,084
HISTORICALLY ROOTED. 

1585
00:52:02,084 --> 00:52:02,685
THE COMMON EXAMPLE BEING 

1586
00:52:02,685 --> 00:52:03,653
úCOMMA 

1587
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:07,057
AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION, THE 

1588
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:10,427
PRESIDENT HAS TO COMPLY WITH THE

1589
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,294
LAW. 

1590
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,996
THE PRESIDENT IS SUBJECT TO THE 

1591
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:15,264
LAW INCLUDING IN THE NATIONAL 

1592
00:52:15,264 --> 00:52:16,433
SECURITY CONTEXT. 

1593
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:19,969
THAT IS THE LESSON, I THINK, OF 

1594
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:22,138
THE YOUNGSTOWN STEELCASE, OF 

1595
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:22,738
JUSTICE JACKSON'S CATEGORIES. 

1596
00:52:22,738 --> 00:52:25,442
CATEGORY 3 AS I'VE SAID IN MY 

1597
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:26,276
WRITINGS, CONGRESS PROHIBITED 

1598
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,911
THE PRESIDENT FROM DOING 

1599
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:28,912
SOMETHING, IT'S CRITICALLY 

1600
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,113
IMPORTANT. 

1601
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,082
THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE RULE 

1602
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:32,916
OF LAW, AS JUSTICE JACKSON 

1603
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:33,149
SAID. 

1604
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,183
THAT IS THE EQUILIBRIUM OF THE 

1605
00:52:34,183 --> 00:52:39,356
COUNTRY, IT'S AT STAKE AND 

1606
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:40,423
CATEGORY 3. I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT 

1607
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:40,923
THAT QUITE FREQUENTLY. 

1608
00:52:40,923 --> 00:52:41,223
>> GOT IT. 

1609
00:52:41,223 --> 00:52:41,524
THANK YOU. 

1610
00:52:41,524 --> 00:52:42,158
TODAY, WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO 

1611
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:45,061
SAID HE COULD AUTHORIZE WORSE 

1612
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:52,469
THAN WATERBOARDING. 

1613
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,303
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? 

1614
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:54,537
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT GOING TO 

1615
00:52:54,537 --> 00:52:59,676
COMMENT AND DON'T THINK I CAN, 

1616
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,144
SITTING HERE, ON CURRENT 

1617
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:01,377
EVENTS. 

1618
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:02,645
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THE LAW IS. 

1619
00:53:02,645 --> 00:53:05,215
YOU'VE MADE THAT CLEAR. 

1620
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,117
>> I KNOW WHAT THE LAW IS, 

1621
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:07,384
SENATOR. 

1622
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,018
>> I'VE ASKED SPECIFICALLY HOW 

1623
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:08,584
YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT. 

1624
00:53:08,584 --> 00:53:12,822
>> I FEEL THAT I SHOULD FOLLOW 

1625
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:15,325
THE LAW, AS A JUDGE. I 

1626
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:17,360
KNOW WHAT THE LAW IS AND I KNOW 

1627
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,929
YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE, 

1628
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:22,532
BOTH WITH THE REPORT YOU DID -- 

1629
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,366
IT WAS THE THOROUGH 

1630
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,701
DOCUMENTATION OF THINGS THAT 

1631
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,402
HAPPENED -- AS WELL, 

1632
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:26,236
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE 

1633
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,036
AND I KNOW YOUR LEADERSHIP WAS 

1634
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:29,773
SENATOR McCAIN ON THE 2005 ACT, 

1635
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:30,173
AS WELL. 

1636
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,741
I KNOW WHAT THE LAW IS AND I'VE 

1637
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:36,145
WRITTEN ABOUT HOW THE 

1638
00:53:36,145 --> 00:53:37,013
SEPARATION OF POWERS WORKS WHEN 

1639
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,548
CONGRESS PASSES LAWS OF THE 

1640
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,951
KIND THAT YOU HAVE. 

1641
00:53:41,951 --> 00:53:45,088
>> ONE LAST QUESTION ON THIS. 

1642
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:46,022
IN DECEMBER OF 2005, PRESIDENT 

1643
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:47,122
BUSH ISSUED A SIGNING STATEMENT 

1644
00:53:47,122 --> 00:53:53,096
REGARDING THE DETAINEE 

1645
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:53,930
TREATMENT ACT OF 2005, 

1646
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:54,563
RESERVING THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHT 

1647
00:53:54,563 --> 00:53:59,236
TO DISREGARD THAT THE LAWS BAN 

1648
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,137
ON TORTURE -- DISREGARD THE BAN 

1649
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:01,972
ON TORTURE IF IT INTERFERED 

1650
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:02,539
WITH HIS CONSTITUTIONAL 

1651
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:07,043
AUTHORITIES AS PRESIDENT. 

1652
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:09,212
WHAT WAS YOUR INVOLVEMENT, IF 

1653
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:10,847
ANY, WITH THIS SIGNING 

1654
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:11,147
STATEMENT? 

1655
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:14,184
>> I WAS STAFF SECRETARY, AND 

1656
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,919
ANY ISSUE THAT REACH THE 

1657
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,087
PRESIDENT'S DESK WITH THE 

1658
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,621
EXCEPTION OF A FEW COVERT 

1659
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:19,288
MATTERS, WOULD HAVE CROSSED MY 

1660
00:54:19,288 --> 00:54:20,757
DESK ON THE WAY TO THE 

1661
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:24,594
PRESIDENT'S DESK. 

1662
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,962
I WOULDN'T HAVE PROVIDED THE 

1663
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:27,731
POLICY ADVICE OR THE LEGAL 

1664
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,966
ADVICE, BUT WHAT IT WOULD HAVE 

1665
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,401
CROSSED MY DESK. 

1666
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:32,736
IN THAT CASE, THE SIGNING 

1667
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:33,470
STATEMENT, THE DRAFTS OF IT, 

1668
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,237
THAT PROCESS WOULD HAVE CROSSED 

1669
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:35,538
MY DESK, AT SOME POINT. 

1670
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,874
>> OKAY. 

1671
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:45,714
IN A 2013 PANEL DISCUSSION, YOU 

1672
00:54:45,714 --> 00:54:48,551
DID NOTHING ABOUT IT, THOUGH -- 

1673
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:49,886
IT CROSSED YOUR DESK AND THAT 

1674
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,254
WAS THAT. 

1675
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,156
>> WELL, THERE WAS DEBATE, AS I 

1676
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:55,258
THINK I'VE MENTIONED, ABOUT 

1677
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:55,592
THAT. 

1678
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:56,393
THE COUNCIL TO THE PRESIDENT, 

1679
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:57,927
MS. MYERS AT THE TIME, WAS THE 

1680
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:01,631
ULTIMATE ADVISOR ON THAT MATTER 

1681
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,066
FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THUS, 

1682
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,134
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE WHO 

1683
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:04,968
PRIMARILY DEALT WITH THAT WITH 

1684
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:05,335
THE PRESIDENT. 

1685
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,036
IT WAS IMPORTANT IN THE JOB I 

1686
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:13,376
HAD, NOT TO SUPPLANT THE POLICY 

1687
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:14,176
OR LEGAL ADVISORS. 

1688
00:55:14,176 --> 00:55:15,645
THAT WAS NOT MY JOB. 

1689
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,314
MY JOB WAS TO MAKE SURE THE 

1690
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:20,817
PRESIDENT HAD THE BENEFIT OF 

1691
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,786
THE VIEWS OF HIS POLICY AND 

1692
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:23,153
LEGAL ADVISORS. 

1693
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:27,490
>> ONE MORE BUSH ERA QUESTION ON

1694
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,758
THIS. 

1695
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,393
IN A 2000 PANEL DISCUSSION AT 

1696
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:31,261
NYU LAW SCHOOL, REGARDING BUSH 

1697
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:31,794
ADMINISTRATION AND ANTI-

1698
00:55:31,794 --> 00:55:32,395
TERRORISM POLICIES, YOU SAID 

1699
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:38,101
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WENT, 

1700
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,103
QUOTE, RIGHT UP TO THAT LEGAL 

1701
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:41,237
LINE TO DEFEND THE SECURITY OF 

1702
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:41,670
THE UNITED STATES. 

1703
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:46,709
IT IMPLIED THAT BUSH POLICIES 

1704
00:55:46,709 --> 00:55:51,314
DID NOT CROSS THE LEGAL LINE. 

1705
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:53,883
DO YOU MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT BUSH

1706
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:54,584
ADMINISTRATION'S POST-9/11 

1707
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,553
PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE CIA 

1708
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,321
TORTURE PROGRAM, WERE LEGAL? 

1709
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,589
>> KNOW, SENATOR. 

1710
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:00,423
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS 

1711
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:00,823
SUGGESTING THERE. 

1712
00:56:00,823 --> 00:56:01,924
LET ME TRY TO PROVIDE YOU AN 

1713
00:56:01,924 --> 00:56:06,696
EXPLANATION. 

1714
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,965
PRESIDENT BUSH'S VIEW, AS HE 

1715
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:10,600
HAS SAID PUBLICLY, WAS IN 

1716
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,468
TRYING TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE, HE 

1717
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,569
WAS GOING TO DO EVERYTHING HE 

1718
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:16,839
COULD WITHIN THE LAW. HE RELIED 

1719
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:19,843
ON HIS LAWYERS TO PROVIDE THE ú 

1720
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,044
AND THEN HE WOULD GO UP TO THAT 

1721
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,413
LINE AS HE THOUGHT EFFECTIVE, 

1722
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,014
AS A MATTER OF POLICY. 

1723
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:29,252
IT WAS UP TO THE LAWYERS, 

1724
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:31,087
THEREFORE, TO MAKE SURE THEY 

1725
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,223
WERE GIVING SOUND ADVICE AND 

1726
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,390
HAVING THE BACKBONE. 

1727
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,625
THIS IS SOMETHING YOUR 

1728
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,125
LEGISLATION REINFORCES. 

1729
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:36,792
LAWYERS NEED TO HAVE BACKBONE 

1730
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:38,627
EVEN IN PRESSURIZED MOMENTS TO 

1731
00:56:38,627 --> 00:56:40,597
SAY NO. 

1732
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,098
I'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT MANY 

1733
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:42,699
TIMES. 

1734
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,133
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 

1735
00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:45,401
RESPONSIBILITIES OF AN 

1736
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,369
úEXECUTI 

1737
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:47,303
PASSIONS OF THE MOMENT WHEN THE 

1738
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:49,739
PRESSURE IS ON OR IF THE 

1739
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,107
PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO 

1740
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:52,475
SOMETHING, PERHAPS, IS TO GO 

1741
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:54,611
INTO THE OVAL OFFICE AND SAY 

1742
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:54,944
NO. 

1743
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,980
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS. 

1744
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,680
THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE WRITTEN 

1745
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,314
ABOUT, TALKED ABOUT AND 

1746
00:56:58,314 --> 00:56:59,148
EXPERIENCED IN MY TIME WITH 

1747
00:56:59,148 --> 00:57:00,183
PRESIDENT BUSH AND I'VE 

1748
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:02,619
ENCOURAGED YOUNG LAWYERS TO 

1749
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:03,286
HAVE THAT BACKBONE AND 

1750
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:08,091
FORTITUDE TO SAY NO. 

1751
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,392
THAT'S ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT 

1752
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:09,759
THING. 

1753
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,126
>> THANK YOU. 

1754
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:10,959
A QUICK CHANGE OF SUBJECT. 

1755
00:57:10,959 --> 00:57:12,394
YOU SAT ON A CASE WHERE A 

1756
00:57:12,394 --> 00:57:23,206
TRAINER, WAS KILLED WITH 

1757
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:23,973
INTERACTING WITH A KILLER WHALE 

1758
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:24,774
DURING A LIVE PERFORMANCE. 

1759
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,308
FOLLOWING HER DEATH, THE 

1760
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:26,109
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH 

1761
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:26,676
ADMINISTRATION FOUND THAT 

1762
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:27,410
SEAWORLD HAD VIOLATED WORKFORCE 

1763
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:40,423
SAFETY LAWS. 

1764
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:41,257
THE MAJORITY AGREED WITH THE 

1765
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:41,790
AGENCY THAT SEAWORLD HAD 

1766
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:42,692
VIOLATED THE LAW AND ACCORDING 

1767
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:43,726
TO WHAT I KNOW, YOU DISAGREED. 

1768
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:44,393
IN YOUR DISSENT, YOU ARGUED 

1769
00:57:44,393 --> 00:57:45,228
THAT THE AGENCY LACKED THE 

1770
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:49,866
AUTHORITY TO REGULATE EMPLOYER 

1771
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:51,301
TO PROTECT PARTICIPANTS IN 

1772
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,937
SPORTING EVENTS OR ENTERTAINMENT

1773
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:54,537
SHOWS. 

1774
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:57,607
HOWEVER, THE STATUTE, AS 

1775
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,309
ENACTED, APPLIES TO EACH 

1776
00:57:59,309 --> 00:57:59,975
EMPLOYER AND IT DEFINED 

1777
00:57:59,975 --> 00:58:00,810
EMPLOYER AS ANYONE ENGAGED IN 

1778
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,945
BUSINESS AFFECTING COMMERCE WHO 

1779
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:07,817
HAS EMPLOYEES. 

1780
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,586
WE ARE IN THE TEXT OF THE LAW 

1781
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:10,220
DID CONGRESS EXEMPT EMPLOYERS 

1782
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:10,687
FROM ANIMAL TRAINERS? 

1783
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:19,462
>> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. 

1784
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,130
THAT DID NOT INVOLVE POTENTIAL 

1785
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,498
CONVERSATION FOR THE FAMILY IT 

1786
00:58:22,498 --> 00:58:23,933
WAS HANDLED THROUGH THE STATE 

1787
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:24,834
OR THEATER -- THROUGH INSURANCE 

1788
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,402
OR A SETTLEMENT WITH SEAWORLD 

1789
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,136
AND THE FAMILIES. 

1790
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,105
THE CASE BEFORE US HAD NOTHING 

1791
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:32,041
TO DO WITH COMPENSATION OF THE 

1792
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,676
FAMILY, AND HAD TO DO A 

1793
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,243
SEPARATE REGULATION OF 

1794
00:58:34,243 --> 00:58:34,510
SEAWORLD. 

1795
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,244
THE ISSUE, SENATOR, WAS 

1796
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:40,850
PRESIDENT. I 

1797
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,651
FOLLOW PRECEDENT. 

1798
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,319
THE PRESIDENT OF THE LABOR 

1799
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,154
DEPARTMENT, AS I READ IT, WAS 

1800
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,122
THE LABOR DEPARTMENT UNDER THIS 

1801
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,023
STATUTE WOULD NOT REGULATE WHAT 

1802
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,092
IT CALLED THE INTRINSIC 

1803
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:52,862
QUALITIES OF A SPORTS OR 

1804
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,295
ENTERTAINMENT SHOW. 

1805
00:58:53,295 --> 00:58:53,763
LOTS OF SPORTS AND 

1806
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:54,296
ENTERTAINMENT SHOWS HAVE 

1807
00:58:54,296 --> 00:58:55,131
SERIOUS DANGERS, WHETHER 

1808
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:59,936
FOOTBALL OR THE BALANCE BEAM IN 

1809
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,071
GYMNASTICS OR THE HIGHWAY OR 

1810
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:03,306
ACT AT THE CIRCUS OR THE LION 

1811
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:03,606
TAMER SHOW. 

1812
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:04,874
THE SEAWORLD SHOW WAS, AS I SAW 

1813
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,075
IT, WITHIN THAT PRECEDENT, IT 

1814
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:08,544
SAID THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WOULD 

1815
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:16,486
NOT REGULATE REGULATE, FOR 

1816
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:17,053
EXAMPLE, WHETHER BASEBALL 

1817
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:17,920
HELMETS HAD TO HAVE EAR FLAPS 

1818
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,955
OR WHETHER TO PROHIBIT THE PUNT 

1819
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:24,627
RETURN OR TO MAKE THE BALANCE 

1820
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,663
BEAM HAVE NUTS. 

1821
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:28,865
THIS SEEMS TO BE COVERED BY 

1822
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,366
THAT PRECEDENT, AS I SAW IT. 

1823
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:32,435
THE LABOR DEPARTMENT AND THE 

1824
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:33,469
ORAL ARGUMENTS TRIED TO 

1825
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:34,737
DISTINGUISH, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 

1826
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:35,672
DANGERS OF FOOTBALL FROM THE 

1827
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:38,041
DANGERS OF THE SEAWORLD SHOW 

1828
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:41,010
AND I DID NOT, AS I EXPLAINED 

1829
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,645
IN THE OPINION, FIND THAT 

1830
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:43,780
PERSUASIVE'S. I 

1831
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,647
DID MAKE CLEAR TWO THINGS. 

1832
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:45,815
ONE, CONGRESS COULD, OF COURSE, 

1833
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:50,486
REGULATE THE INTRINSIC DECISION 

1834
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:51,354
TO REGULATE THE QUALITIES OF 

1835
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:52,088
SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT SHOWS. 

1836
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:55,191
OR, THE LABOR DEPARTMENT COULD 

1837
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:58,294
CHANGE PRECEDENT. 

1838
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:00,797
AND, I MADE CLEAR THAT STATE 

1839
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,266
TORT LAW, AS THE NFL EXPERIENCE 

1840
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,168
WITH THE CONCUSSION ISSUE, STATE

1841
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:06,869
TORT LAW ALWAYS EXISTS AS A WAY 

1842
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:07,670
TO ENSURE OR HELP ENSURE SAFETY 

1843
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,937
IN THINGS LIKE THE SEAWORLD 

1844
01:00:08,937 --> 01:00:11,941
SHOW. 

1845
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,860
>>> YOU HAVE OBJECTED TO THIS 

1846
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:35,198
LIMIT ON THE PRESIDENT'S POWER 

1847
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,466
AND STRUCK DOWN FOR THE FOR 

1848
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,202
CAUSE REQUIREMENT IN A CASE 

1849
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:41,037
INVOLVING THE CONSUMER 

1850
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:42,972
FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. 

1851
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:47,210
THE DC CIRCUIT DISAGREED AND 

1852
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:47,809
OVERTURNED YOUR DECISION. 

1853
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:50,446
IF THE PRESIDENT CAN FIRE THE 

1854
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:52,248
HEADS OF INDEPENDENT AGENCIES 

1855
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:55,785
FOR ANY REASON, WHAT IS TO 

1856
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:57,453
PREVENT POLITICAL INTERFERENCE 

1857
01:00:57,453 --> 01:00:58,187
IN THESE INDEPENDENT AGENCIES? 

1858
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:04,627
>>  SENATOR, I HAVE FOLLOWED 

1859
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:05,194
THE HUMPHREY'S EXECUTIVE. 

1860
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,196
THAT IS THE PRECEDENT THAT 

1861
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:08,598
ALLOWS INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND 

1862
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:12,802
PROTECTS THEM FROM AT WILL 

1863
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:13,202
FIRING. 

1864
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:17,340
AS A GENERAL MATTER, I HAVE 

1865
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,244
AFFIRMED, OR FOLLOWED THE 

1866
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:21,944
PRECEDENT OF HUMPHREY'S 

1867
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:22,211
EXECUTOR. 

1868
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:23,946
THE CONGRESS ESTABLISHED A NEW 

1869
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:25,948
INDEPENDENT AGENCY THAT DID NOT 

1870
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,850
FOLLOW THE TRADITION MODEL OF 

1871
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,986
INDEPENDENT AGENCIES OF HAVING 

1872
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:30,386
MULTIPLE MEMBERS. 

1873
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,188
THAT'S ALL I THOUGHT WAS A 

1874
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:32,621
PROBLEMATIC THERE. 

1875
01:01:32,621 --> 01:01:34,891
AND I DID NOT INVALIDATE OR DID 

1876
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:36,993
NOT SAY THE AGENCY SHOULD STOP 

1877
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:37,293
OPERATING. 

1878
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:41,397
I SAID THE AGENCY CAN CONTINUE 

1879
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:42,365
PERFORMING ITS IMPORTANCE 

1880
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,766
FUNCTIONS ON BEHALF OF 

1881
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:46,269
CONSUMERS, BUT EITHER IT HAD TO 

1882
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,271
BE RESTRUCTURED AS A 

1883
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,272
MULTIMEMBER AGENCY OR THE 

1884
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:50,807
PRESIDENT HAD TO BE ABLE TO 

1885
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:51,707
REMOVE THE SINGLE HEAD AT WILL. 

1886
01:01:51,707 --> 01:01:54,744
>>  THE LIMITED SET OF 

1887
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:55,344
DOCUMENTS WE'VE RECEIVED 

1888
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,747
INDICATES THAT YOU WERE HEAVILY 

1889
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:59,649
INVOLVED IN THE BUSH WHITE 

1890
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:03,085
HOUSE'S RESPONSE TO 

1891
01:02:03,085 --> 01:02:06,155
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS 

1892
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:08,223
AFTER THE ENRON SCANDAL. 

1893
01:02:08,223 --> 01:02:08,657
IS THAT ACCURATE? 

1894
01:02:08,657 --> 01:02:10,959
>>  THAT IS ACCURATE. 

1895
01:02:10,959 --> 01:02:14,230
WE HAD A DOCUMENT FROM SENATOR 

1896
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,730
LIEBERMAN'S COMMITTEE. 

1897
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,399
I WAS A LEADER THAT HAD TO HELP 

1898
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,401
GATHER THE DOCUMENTS FROM 

1899
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,137
PEOPLE WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE 

1900
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:21,670
AND NEGOTIATE DOCUMENTS. 

1901
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:24,073
I HAD TO NEGOTIATE DOCUMENTS 

1902
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:24,840
WITH SENATOR LIEBERMAN'S STAFF. 

1903
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,875
>>  RIGHT. 

1904
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:29,178
SO YOU KNOW THAT ENRON WAS ONE 

1905
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:30,546
OF THE GREATEST CORPORATE 

1906
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:31,714
SCANDALS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. 

1907
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,382
I CAN TELL YOU AS A SENATOR 

1908
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:36,486
FROM CALIFORNIA, NOT ONLY DID 

1909
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:37,887
MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS LOSE 

1910
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,856
EVERYTHING FINANCIALLY WHEN 

1911
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,491
ENRON COLLAPSED UNDER THE 

1912
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,292
WEIGHT OF ITS ACCOUNTING FRAUD, 

1913
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:46,996
BUT THE FRAUD AND MARKET 

1914
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,198
MANIPULATION CONTRIBUTED TO AN 

1915
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:51,600
ENERGY CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. 

1916
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,102
WHITE HOUSE E-MAILS SHOW THAT 

1917
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,271
YOU WERE ASKED TO REVIEW A SET 

1918
01:02:55,271 --> 01:03:00,776
OF DRAFT TALKING POINTS FOR 

1919
01:03:00,776 --> 01:03:02,778
PRESS SECRETARY, FLIESHER, THAT 

1920
01:03:02,778 --> 01:03:04,380
ADDRESS THE ROLE OF 

1921
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,183
MANIPULATION IN THE CALIFORNIA 

1922
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:07,583
ENERGY CRISIS. 

1923
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:09,185
ESSENTIALLY, THE TALKING POINT 

1924
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:12,321
SAID IF THERE WAS ANY 

1925
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:13,789
MISCONDUCT BY ENRON, IT WAS UP 

1926
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:16,692
TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY 

1927
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,694
REGULATORY COMMISSION TO 

1928
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:20,296
INVESTIGATE AND PUNISH THE 

1929
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:20,563
COMPANY. 

1930
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,232
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU IF YOU 

1931
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:24,801
REMEMBER THE SPECIFIC DOCUMENT, 

1932
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,371
BUT WAS THAT YOUR VIEW THAT THE 

1933
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,173
REGULATORY BODY THAT WAS 

1934
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:34,677
SUPPOSED TO STOP THIS SORT OF 

1935
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:34,977
MISCONDUCT? 

1936
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,846
>>  I'M NOT RECALLING THE 

1937
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:37,646
SPECIFICS ON THAT. 

1938
01:03:37,646 --> 01:03:39,982
SENATOR, MY ROLE AS A GENERAL 

1939
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:44,287
MATTER WAS TO HELP GATHER 

1940
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,222
DOCUMENTS IN RESPONSE TO 

1941
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:49,825
SENATOR LIEBERMAN'S REQUEST, AS 

1942
01:03:49,825 --> 01:03:50,092
I RECALL. 

1943
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:55,531
AND I KNOW FERK WOULD HAVE A 

1944
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:55,731
ROLE. 

1945
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,301
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS MY AREA 

1946
01:03:58,301 --> 01:03:58,901
OF EXPERTISE. 

1947
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,569
I'M NOT RECALLING IT 

1948
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:04,774
SPECIFICALLY, SENATOR. 

1949
01:04:13,215 --> 01:04:14,983
>>  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

1950
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:20,356
>>  APPRECIATE THE WAY YOU 

1951
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,424
CONDUCTED THESE HEARINGS, 

1952
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:23,192
INSPITE OF THESE IRRESPONSIBLE 

1953
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:23,492
OUTBURSTS. 

1954
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:24,893
THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. 

1955
01:04:24,893 --> 01:04:26,195
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I WOULD LIKE 

1956
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:29,298
TO COMMEND YOU FOR HOW YOU 

1957
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:29,765
PRESENTED YOURSELF. 

1958
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:31,334
YOU DISPLAYED THE LEVEL 

1959
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:34,170
HEADEDNESS THAT SO MANY OF YOUR 

1960
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,204
FRIENDS TELL US EXIST. 

1961
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,773
I WOULD SAY YOUR FRIENDS OF 

1962
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:39,175
FOREIGN COLLEAGUES DESCRIBED IN 

1963
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:40,476
THEIR LETTERS TO THIS 

1964
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,011
COMMITTEE, I WISH YOU COULD SAY 

1965
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:44,080
THE SAME ABOUT EVERYONE WHO 

1966
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:44,981
ATTENDED THIS HEARING OR 

1967
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:48,584
COVERED IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. 

1968
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:49,919
BUT I CAN'T. 

1969
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:55,257
DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE THEE 

1970
01:04:55,257 --> 01:05:01,097
YOURS TRULY TEATRICS WE HAVE 

1971
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:01,297
SEEN. 

1972
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:03,098
I'M THE FORMER CHAIRMAN. 

1973
01:05:03,098 --> 01:05:07,003
NEVER HAVE I SEEN THE CONSTANT 

1974
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:09,205
INTERRUPTIONS WE WITNESS AT 

1975
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:09,572
THIS HEARING. 

1976
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,106
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS ARE 

1977
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:11,874
SUPPOSED TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY 

1978
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,776
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO HEAR 

1979
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:15,443
FROM THE NOMINEE. 

1980
01:05:15,443 --> 01:05:16,579
UNFORTUNATELY, IT SEEMS THAT 

1981
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,780
SOME ON THE POLITICAL LEFT 

1982
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,214
DECIDED TO TRY TO TURN THIS 

1983
01:05:19,214 --> 01:05:21,016
HEARING INTO A CIRCUS. 

1984
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:22,818
NOW I WORRY ABOUT THE PRECEDENT 

1985
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:25,921
THIS IS SETTING FOR FUTURE 

1986
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:26,321
CONFIRMATIONS. 

1987
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:27,055
THAT'S NOT THE WORST. 

1988
01:05:27,055 --> 01:05:29,325
NOW THE WORST OF IT ARE THE 

1989
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:30,426
ATTACKS AGAINST PEOPLE WHO 

1990
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,328
AREN'T EVEN UP FOR 

1991
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:32,695
CONFIRMATION. 

1992
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:33,896
WHO JUST HAPPEN TO BE HERE IN 

1993
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:37,033
THE ROOM TO SUPPORT THE 

1994
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:37,300
NOMINEE. 

1995
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,501
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT SUPREME 

1996
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,202
COURT NOMINATIONS HAVE TURNED 

1997
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:42,605
INTO ALL OUT WAR AGAINST THE 

1998
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:42,872
NOMINEE. 

1999
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:45,474
HAVE WE REALLY REACHED A POINT 

2000
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:46,675
WHERE ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS OR 

2001
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:51,213
EVEN SITS BEHIND A NOMINEE MUST 

2002
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:55,184
ALSO BE DESTROYED? 

2003
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:57,019
HAVE WE REACHED THAT LOW? 

2004
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,321
TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN 

2005
01:05:58,321 --> 01:05:59,821
UNFAIRLY CAUGHT UP IN THE MOB 

2006
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:02,224
MENTALITY, I WANT TO SAY, YOUR 

2007
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:03,726
RIGHT TO BE HERE. 

2008
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,628
SUPPORTING SOMEONE YOU BELIEVE 

2009
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:05,794
IN. 

2010
01:06:05,794 --> 01:06:07,296
DON'T LET THE FACT THAT THERE 

2011
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,132
ARE A LOT OF FRANKLY, SICK 

2012
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,600
PEOPLE OUT THERE, CAUSE YOU TO 

2013
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,805
LOSE FAITH IN OUR POLITICAL 

2014
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:16,072
PROCESS. 

2015
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:19,108
WE NEED GOOD, DECENT PEOPLE TO 

2016
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:22,845
STEP FORWARD, TO CONTRIBUTE. 

2017
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,480
EVEN WHEN IT'S UGLY. 

2018
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,381
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT'S UGLY. 

2019
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:26,682
NOW TO MY QUESTIONS. 

2020
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:28,484
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 

2021
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,919
AS I DID YESTERDAY, I WOULD 

2022
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:33,255
LIKE TO ASK YOU TO KEEP YOUR 

2023
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:34,824
ANSWERS CONCISE, SO WE CAN GET 

2024
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,625
THROUGH AS MANY AS WE CAN. 

2025
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,127
LATE LAST NIGHT, ONE OF MY 

2026
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,229
COLLEAGUES ASKED YOU A SERIES 

2027
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:41,931
OF OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS ABOUT 

2028
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:43,332
ANY CONVERSATIONS YOU HAVE HAD 

2029
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:47,903
WITH ANYONE AT A 350 PERSON LAW 

2030
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,473
FIRM ABOUT SPECIAL COUNCIL, BOB 

2031
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:51,474
MUELLER, OR HIS INVESTIGATION. 

2032
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:53,409
YOU SAID YOU DO NOT REMEMBER 

2033
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:56,912
HAVING HAD ANY SUCH 

2034
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:57,279
CONVERSATIONS. 

2035
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:58,013
MY COLLEAGUE DID NOT CLARIFY 

2036
01:06:58,013 --> 01:06:59,482
WHY MY COLLEAGUE WAS ASKING THE 

2037
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:01,150
QUESTIONS AND DID NOT ALLOW YOU 

2038
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,485
TO COMPLETE YOUR ANSWERS. 

2039
01:07:03,485 --> 01:07:05,321
I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO 

2040
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:07,489
RESPOND, IF YOU'D LIKE TO. 

2041
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:09,825
>>  SENATOR, I DON'T RECALL ANY 

2042
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:11,026
CONVERSATIONS OF THAT KIND WITH 

2043
01:07:11,026 --> 01:07:13,629
ANYONE AT THAT LAW FIRM. 

2044
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:14,930
I DIDN'T KNOW EVERYONE WHO 

2045
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:18,734
MIGHT WORK AT THAT LAW FIRM. 

2046
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,336
BUT I DON'T RECALL ANY 

2047
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:21,103
CONVERSATIONS OF THAT KIND. 

2048
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:23,773
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY INAPPROPRIATE 

2049
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,074
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT 

2050
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,108
INVESTIGATION WITH ANYONE. 

2051
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:30,479
I HAVE NEVER GIVEN ANYONE ANY 

2052
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,114
HINTS, FORECASTS, PREVIEWS, 

2053
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,383
WINKS, NOTHING ABOUT MY VIEW AS 

2054
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,052
A JUDGE OR HOW I WOULD RULE AS 

2055
01:07:37,052 --> 01:07:41,323
A JUDGE ON THAT OR ANYTHING 

2056
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:41,723
RELATED TO THAT. 

2057
01:07:41,723 --> 01:07:45,828
SO, I THANK YOU FOR THE 

2058
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:46,829
OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY AND 

2059
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:47,563
REASSURE YOU ON THAT. 

2060
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:48,631
>>  THANK YOU. 

2061
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:54,436
WITH ALL OF THE ACCUSATIONS AND 

2062
01:07:54,436 --> 01:07:55,070
INSINUATIONS YESTERDAY, THERE 

2063
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,306
IS SOMETHING I HAVE TO COME 

2064
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:57,639
CLEAN ABOUT. 

2065
01:07:57,639 --> 01:08:01,077
I'M ON THE BOARD OF VISITORS TO 

2066
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,677
THE FEDERAL SOCIETY. 

2067
01:08:02,677 --> 01:08:02,978
IT'S TRUE. 

2068
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:04,012
FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR 

2069
01:08:04,012 --> 01:08:05,714
WITH THE FEDERAL SOCIETY, 

2070
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,683
GENERALLY HOLDS DEBATES AND 

2071
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:10,219
PUTS TOGETHER PANELS ON LEGAL 

2072
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:13,022
ISSUES COVERING ALL SIDES OF 

2073
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:13,355
THESE ISSUES. 

2074
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,524
THE LIBERAL, THE CONSERVATIVE, 

2075
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:15,791
ETCETERA. 

2076
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:18,527
IT'S A VERY RESPONSIBLE 

2077
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:19,095
ORGANIZATION. 

2078
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,229
THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION 

2079
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:21,029
SOCIETY, THE DEMOCRATIC 

2080
01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:24,934
ORGANIZATION DOES MUCH THE SAME 

2081
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:25,201
THING. 

2082
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:25,834
I RESPECT THEM. 

2083
01:08:25,834 --> 01:08:28,703
EXCEPT IT FOCUSES ON LIBERAL OR 

2084
01:08:28,703 --> 01:08:29,171
PROGRESSIVE LAWYERS. 

2085
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:32,207
SO, THIS IS FAMILIAR TO MY 

2086
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:33,509
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES ON THIS 

2087
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:33,809
COMMITTEE. 

2088
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:37,479
THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH 

2089
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:39,915
ACS FROM KEYNOTING THE ANNUAL 

2090
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:41,617
CONFERENCE TO BEING AN HONORARY 

2091
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:42,318
HOST COMMITTEE CHAIR. 

2092
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:44,620
FOR SPEAKING ON PANELS, TO 

2093
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,856
WRITING BLOG ENTRIES FOR THE 

2094
01:08:47,856 --> 01:08:48,424
ORGANIZATION. 

2095
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:54,029
I EVEN HEARD A NASTY RUMOR THAT 

2096
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:55,196
ONE SPOKE AT A FEDERAL SOCIETY. 

2097
01:08:55,196 --> 01:08:56,497
WHEN IT CAME TO YOUR 

2098
01:08:56,497 --> 01:08:58,334
NOMINATION, YOU SPOKE WITH THE 

2099
01:08:58,334 --> 01:08:59,234
PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT, 

2100
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:04,573
AND THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL, 

2101
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:05,173
NOT THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY. 

2102
01:09:05,173 --> 01:09:07,109
I DON'T NEED TO ASK YOU ABOUT 

2103
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:07,309
THAT. 

2104
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,410
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THIS. 

2105
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:11,212
WHAT HAS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH 

2106
01:09:11,212 --> 01:09:12,714
THE FEDERAL SOCIETY BEEN? 

2107
01:09:12,714 --> 01:09:16,017
>>  SENATOR, THANK YOU. 

2108
01:09:16,017 --> 01:09:19,621
THE FEDERAL SOCIETY AS YOU 

2109
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:22,124
NOTE, PROVIDES -- HOLDS DEBATES 

2110
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:22,524
AT LAW SCHOOLS. 

2111
01:09:22,524 --> 01:09:23,492
>>  ON BOTH SIDES. 

2112
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,260
>>  ON BOTH SIDES. 

2113
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:26,828
THE TYPICAL PROGRAM OF A 

2114
01:09:26,828 --> 01:09:28,964
FEDERAL SOCIETY EVENT AT A LAW 

2115
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:31,033
SCHOOL WILL HAVE TWO SPEAKERS 

2116
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:34,303
AND A MODERATOR THAT IS TYPICAL 

2117
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:35,703
WITH THE TWO SPEAKERS 

2118
01:09:35,703 --> 01:09:37,072
PRESENTING DIFFERENT VIEWS ON 

2119
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:37,639
AN ISSUE. 

2120
01:09:37,639 --> 01:09:40,309
IT COULD BE, FOR EXAMPLE, 

2121
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:42,611
FOURTH AMENDMENT PRIVACY, WHERE 

2122
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:44,313
YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS A 

2123
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:46,014
DIFFERENT VIEW ON NATIONAL 

2124
01:09:46,014 --> 01:09:47,316
SECURITY RELATED FOURTH 

2125
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:50,051
AMENDMENT ISSUES OR ON FREE 

2126
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:50,419
SPEECH ISSUES. 

2127
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:51,787
ALL SORTS OF LEGAL ISSUES. 

2128
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:54,156
THEY TRY TO HAVE DEBATES WHERE 

2129
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:55,658
BOTH SIDES ARE PRESENTED AT THE 

2130
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:57,259
LAW SCHOOL EVENTS THAT I'VE 

2131
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:57,960
BEEN TO. 

2132
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,328
AT THE CONVENTIONS, THEY WILL 

2133
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:02,331
ALWAYS HAVE PANELS OF FOUR OR 

2134
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,332
FIVE WITH A MODERATOR. 

2135
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:05,267
THEY'LL HAVE A SPECTRUM OF 

2136
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:07,903
VIEWS REPRESENTED ON A 

2137
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:08,303
DIFFERENT TOPIC. 

2138
01:10:08,303 --> 01:10:09,638
THEY ARE VERY ENRICHING IN 

2139
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:11,640
TERMS OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE 

2140
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,241
LAW. 

2141
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,410
AND THEY ARE ALSO ENRICHING, I 

2142
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,712
BELIEVE, IN TERMS OF PROVIDING 

2143
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:19,181
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE 

2144
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:23,052
LAW AND THEY WELCOME PEOPLE AND 

2145
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,053
ACTUALLY INSIST ON HAVING 

2146
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,554
PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT 

2147
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,889
PERSPECTIVES AT THE EVENT. 

2148
01:10:27,889 --> 01:10:29,925
SO, IT IS VERY BENEFICIAL TO 

2149
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:30,692
THE LAW, I THINK. 

2150
01:10:30,692 --> 01:10:32,861
THE PROGRAMS THEY HAVE AT THE 

2151
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:34,563
LAW SCHOOLS, THEY ARE VERY 

2152
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:34,896
EDUCATIONAL. 

2153
01:10:34,896 --> 01:10:36,165
THEY PROVIDE SOME OF THE BEST 

2154
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:37,700
DEBATES THAT ARE HELD AT THE 

2155
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,034
LAW SCHOOLS, I BELIEVE. 

2156
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:40,603
SO I THINK THE ORGANIZATION, 

2157
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:42,404
WHICH ITSELF DOES NOT LOBBY AND 

2158
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,039
DOES NOT FILE BRIEFS OR 

2159
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:44,472
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 

2160
01:10:44,472 --> 01:10:46,041
DOES A VERY VALUABLE SERVICE AT 

2161
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,309
LAW SCHOOLS IN THE LEGAL 

2162
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:49,078
COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE FOR 

2163
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,447
BRINGING TOGETHER DIFFERENT 

2164
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:55,184
VIEWS ON IMPORTANT LEGAL ISSUES 

2165
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,553
AND I APPLAUD THEM FOR THEIR 

2166
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:59,355
EFFORTS TO BRING SPEAKERS TO 

2167
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,123
CAMPUS AND PROVIDE LEGAL 

2168
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:03,325
DEBATES ON CAMPUS AND IN 

2169
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:03,792
LAWYERS CONVENTIONS. 

2170
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:07,129
>>  YOU HAVE DESCRIBED IT QUITE 

2171
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:09,965
WELL. 

2172
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,066
ORAL ARGUMENT IN MICROSOFT 

2173
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:13,235
VERSUS UNITED STATES, ALSO 

2174
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:15,838
KNOWN AS THE MICROSOFT IRELAND 

2175
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:16,038
CASE. 

2176
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:17,139
NATURALLY, I WAS VERY 

2177
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:17,572
INTERESTED IN THAT. 

2178
01:11:17,572 --> 01:11:19,441
AT ISSUE IN THE CASE WAS THE 

2179
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,744
MEANING OF THE STORED 

2180
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:22,644
COMMUNICATIONS ACT, AND WHETHER 

2181
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:27,249
A WARRANT FOR DATA STORED 

2182
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:28,751
OVERSEAS BUT ACCESSIBLE IN THE 

2183
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:32,688
UNITED STATES FALLS WITHIN THE 

2184
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:32,955
CONFINES. 

2185
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:33,555
I HAD INTRODUCED LEGISLATION 

2186
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:36,925
KNOWN AS THE CLOUD ACT, TO 

2187
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:39,794
RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. 

2188
01:11:39,794 --> 01:11:40,562
FOLLOWING ORAL ARGUMENT, 

2189
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:41,663
CONGRESS PASSED THE CLOUD ACT, 

2190
01:11:41,663 --> 01:11:43,766
MUTING THE CASE BEFORE THE 

2191
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:43,999
COURT. 

2192
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,567
NOW THE SPECIFIC QUESTION AT 

2193
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,403
ISSUE IN THE MICROSOFT, IRELAND 

2194
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:50,639
CASE, HAS BEEN RESOLVED BY MY 

2195
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:50,972
LEGISLATION. 

2196
01:11:50,972 --> 01:11:53,442
BUT THE CASE ALSO RAISED A 

2197
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:55,077
BROADER QUESTION THAT I WOULD 

2198
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:56,144
LIKE TO ASK YOU. 

2199
01:11:56,144 --> 01:11:59,248
WHEN THE STORED COMMUNICATIONS 

2200
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:02,351
ACT WAS PASSED IN 1986, NO ONE 

2201
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,986
IMAGINED A WORLD WHERE DATA 

2202
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:07,156
COULD BE STORED OVERSEAS, BUT 

2203
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,758
ACCESSIBLE  INSTANTANEOUSLY IN 

2204
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:11,593
THE UNITED STATES. 

2205
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:14,063
IT WAS CLEAR THE DATA STORED IN 

2206
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:14,596
THE UNITED STATES. 

2207
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:18,567
BUT IT WAS LESS CLEAR THAT IT 

2208
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:22,137
EXTENDED   TO DATA STORED 

2209
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:24,339
ABROAD, USING TECHNOLOGIES NOT 

2210
01:12:24,339 --> 01:12:25,140
AVAILABLE IN 1986. 

2211
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,010
HOW DO WE INTERPRET OUR LAWS IN 

2212
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,211
LIGHT OF CHANGING TECHNOLOGY? 

2213
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:31,747
HOW DO WE DETERMINE WHETHER THE 

2214
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:32,548
AUTHORS AND ENACTORS OF 

2215
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:33,916
LEGISLATION WOULD HAVE INTENDED 

2216
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:40,155
THE LEGISLATION TO COVER NEW  

2217
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:40,755
TECHNOLOGIES IN UNFORESEEN 

2218
01:12:40,755 --> 01:12:41,056
SITUATIONS? 

2219
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,157
>>  THERE, AS ELSEWHERE, THE 

2220
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:44,459
JOB OF A JUDGE IS TO FOCUS ON 

2221
01:12:44,459 --> 01:12:46,261
THE WORDS WRITTEN IN THE 

2222
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,564
STATUTE PASSED BY CONGRESS. 

2223
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:49,565
SOMETIMES CONGRESS WILL WRITE A 

2224
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:52,401
STATUTE WHERE THE WORDS ARE 

2225
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:53,802
VERY PRECISE AND QUITE CLEAR. 

2226
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,170
IT COVERS ONLY SOMETHING THAT 

2227
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:58,240
MIGHT BE IN EXISTENCE AT THE 

2228
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:58,440
TIME. 

2229
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,143
SOMETIMES CONGRESS WILL WRITE 

2230
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:03,645
BROADER WORDS AS DOES THE 

2231
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:05,747
CONSTITUTION AT TIMES THAT CAN 

2232
01:13:05,747 --> 01:13:08,951
APPLY TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES, FOR 

2233
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:12,488
EXAMPLE, THE FOURTH AMENDMENT, 

2234
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:13,455
OF COURSE, IN THE CONSTITUTION 

2235
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:14,890
APPLIES TO THINGS THAT WERE NOT 

2236
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:18,060
KNOWN AT THE FOUNDING, 

2237
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,228
INCLUDING CARS AND 

2238
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,262
COMMUNICATION DEVICES THAT WERE 

2239
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:21,929
NOT KNOWN AT THE FOUNDING. 

2240
01:13:21,929 --> 01:13:23,631
SO TOO WITH STATUTES. 

2241
01:13:23,631 --> 01:13:27,569
IT DEPENDS ON HOW BROADLY OR 

2242
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:30,205
NARROWLY YOU HAVE WRITTEN IT. 

2243
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:31,806
IT RAISES ANOTHER QUESTION. 

2244
01:13:31,806 --> 01:13:33,342
THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY AND 

2245
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:36,345
LIBERTY ON THE ONE HAND VERSUS 

2246
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:37,145
SECURITY, LAW ENFORCEMENT ON 

2247
01:13:37,145 --> 01:13:40,449
THE OTHER IS AN ENORMOUS ISSUE 

2248
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:43,051
GOING FORWARD FOR THE CONGRESS 

2249
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,186
IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, I 

2250
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:46,088
BELIEVE, AND ALSO FOR THE 

2251
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,222
FEDERAL COURTS, INCLUDING THE 

2252
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:49,757
SUPREME COURT GOING FORWARD. 

2253
01:13:49,757 --> 01:13:52,494
THE CARPENTER CASE IS A GOOD 

2254
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:53,462
EXAMPLE, WRITTEN BY CHIEF 

2255
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:53,928
JUSTICE ROBERTS. 

2256
01:13:53,928 --> 01:13:55,998
AS I LOOK AHEAD OVER THE NEXT 

2257
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:59,234
10 TO 20 YEARS, THAT BALANCE OF 

2258
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:00,168
FOURTH AMENDMENT, LIBERTY AND 

2259
01:14:00,168 --> 01:14:02,037
PRIVACY VERSUS SECURITY AND LAW 

2260
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:03,772
ENFORCEMENT IS AN ENORMOUS 

2261
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:04,005
ISSUE. 

2262
01:14:04,005 --> 01:14:08,143
>>  I APPRECIATE THAT. 

2263
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,778
ON THE DOMESTIC FRONT, THERE'S 

2264
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,446
BEEN DEBATE FOR SOME TIME NOW 

2265
01:14:11,446 --> 01:14:16,985
IN CONGRESS ABOUT WHETHER OUR 

2266
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:19,353
LAWS SHOULD BE UPDATED. 

2267
01:14:19,353 --> 01:14:21,390
TO REQUIRE A WARRANT FOR THE 

2268
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,559
CONTENT OF ELECTRONIC 

2269
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:24,960
COMMUNICATIONS REGARDLESS OF 

2270
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,563
HOW OLD THOSE COMMUNICATIONS 

2271
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:27,763
ARE. 

2272
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:30,899
AS YOU MAY KNOW, THE ELECTRONIC 

2273
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,201
COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT 

2274
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,469
CURRENTLY DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN 

2275
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,737
COMMUNICATIONS THAT ARE LESS 

2276
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,539
THAN 180 DAYS OLD AND THOSE 

2277
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,641
THAT ARE MORE THAN 180 DAYS 

2278
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,944
OLD, REQUIRING A WARRANT FOR 

2279
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:42,244
THE FORMER. 

2280
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:43,778
BUT NOT THE LADDER. 

2281
01:14:43,778 --> 01:14:45,781
CAN YOU SPEAK GENERALLY TO THE 

2282
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:47,182
IMPORTANCE OF WARRANT 

2283
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:49,151
REQUIREMENTS OF WHY THEY ARE AN 

2284
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,986
IMPORTANT WORK AGAINST THE 

2285
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:51,453
GOVERNMENT OVERREACH. 

2286
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:54,790
>>  THE WARRANT REQUIREMENT 

2287
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:55,591
HELPS ENSURE, AS A GENERAL 

2288
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:57,192
MATTER, THAT THE EXECUTIVE 

2289
01:14:57,192 --> 01:15:01,196
BRANCH IS NOT UNILATERALLY ABLE 

2290
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:04,099
TO INVADE SOMEONE'S PRIVACY, 

2291
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:06,201
SOMEONE'S LIBERTY WITHOUT 

2292
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,336
JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT THAT ENSURES 

2293
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,337
THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE OR 

2294
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,439
WHATEVER THE STANDARD MIGHT BE 

2295
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:15,177
IN A STATUTORY SITUATION TO GET 

2296
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,545
SOMEONE'S RECORDS OR 

2297
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:18,247
INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE INVADE 

2298
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:20,148
THEIR LIBERTY OR PRIVACY. 

2299
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:21,049
THAT JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT IS PART 

2300
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:22,451
OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES OF 

2301
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:24,386
THE CONSTITUTION AND CONGRESS 

2302
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,121
HAS WRITTEN THAT ALSO INTO 

2303
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:28,590
SEVERAL STATUTES, AS YOU KNOW, 

2304
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:28,856
SENATOR. 

2305
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:30,993
>>  I WANT TO RETURN TO THE E-

2306
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:33,562
MAIL SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS 

2307
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:34,596
ASKING YOU ABOUT. 

2308
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:39,167
YOU WERE ASKED FOR YOUR 

2309
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,169
COMMENTS ON AN AD THAT WAS 

2310
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:45,340
GOING TO BE PUBLISHED BY PRO 

2311
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,709
CHOICE WOMEN IN REGARDS TO THE 

2312
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:47,976
NOMINEE. 

2313
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:50,379
YOU SAID, QUOTE, I AM NOT SURE 

2314
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:53,382
ALL LEGAL SCHOLARS REFER TO ROE 

2315
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,183
AS THE SETTLED LAW OF THE LAND 

2316
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:59,621
AT THE SUPREME COURT LEVEL. 

2317
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:04,893
SINCE COURT CAN ALWAYS OVERRULE 

2318
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,494
ITS PRECEDENT, END QUOTE. 

2319
01:16:06,494 --> 01:16:14,403
YOU ALSO ADDED, THE POINT THERE 

2320
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:17,039
IS IN THE INFERIOR COURT POINT, 

2321
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:17,306
UNQUOTE. 

2322
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:18,440
WERE YOU GIVING YOUR OPINION ON 

2323
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,842
ROE THERE OR WERE YOU TALKING 

2324
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:25,947
ABOUT WHAT LAW SCHOLARS MIGHT 

2325
01:16:25,947 --> 01:16:26,147
SAY? 

2326
01:16:26,147 --> 01:16:28,650
>>  I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT 

2327
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:31,153
LEGAL SCHOLARS MIGHT SAY. 

2328
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:33,989
>>  OKAY, SO WE GOT THAT 

2329
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:34,289
CLEARED UP. 

2330
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:37,225
YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICAL ABOUT 

2331
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:41,263
SENTENCING DEFENDANTS BASED ON 

2332
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:42,598
UNCHARGED OR ACQUITTED CONDUCT. 

2333
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,498
WITH REGARD TO ACQUITTED 

2334
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:44,933
CONDUCT IN PARTICULAR, I AGREE 

2335
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,235
THAT THE NOTION THAT A JUDGE 

2336
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:49,171
CAN SENTENCE A DEFENDANT TO A 

2337
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:52,074
LONG PRISON TERM FOR A CRIME 

2338
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:54,276
THAT A JURY ACQUITTED THE 

2339
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:54,876
DEFENDANT OF IMPLIES IN THE 

2340
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:57,478
FACE OF THE RIGHT TO A JURY 

2341
01:16:57,478 --> 01:16:57,712
TRIAL. 

2342
01:16:57,712 --> 01:16:59,581
YOU HAVE WRITTEN THAT YOU 

2343
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:01,583
BELIEVE, QUOTE, IT LIKELY WILL 

2344
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,218
TAKE SOME COMBINATION OF 

2345
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:06,021
CONGRESS AND THE SENTENCING 

2346
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:07,122
COMMISSION TO SYSTEMATICALLY 

2347
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,323
CHANGE FEDERAL SENTENCING TO 

2348
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:12,894
PRECLUDE USE OF AN ACQUITTED OR 

2349
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:13,494
UNCHARGED CONDUCT, UNQUOTE. 

2350
01:17:13,494 --> 01:17:15,130
WHY DO YOU TAKE ISSUE WITH THE 

2351
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,631
USE OF ACQUITTED CONDUCT AT 

2352
01:17:16,631 --> 01:17:17,699
SENTENCING AND WHY DO YOU 

2353
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,334
BELIEVE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT 

2354
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:20,636
WILL LIKELY REQUIRE 

2355
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:25,073
INTERVENTION BY CONGRESS TO 

2356
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:25,340
RESOLVE? 

2357
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,210
>>  THE OPINIONS I'VE WRITTEN 

2358
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,078
ON THIS, AND I'VE WRITTEN 

2359
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:31,913
SEVERAL, IN ESSENCE THE 

2360
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:32,380
FOLLOWING, SENATOR. 

2361
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,715
WHEN A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT, FOR 

2362
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:37,552
EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY IS CHARGED 

2363
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:38,986
WITH TEN COUNTS, LET'S SUPPOSE, 

2364
01:17:38,986 --> 01:17:41,022
AND ACQUITTED ON NINE AND 

2365
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:42,057
CONVICTED ON ONE. 

2366
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:43,558
AND THEN THE CRIMINAL DEFENDANT 

2367
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:45,360
IS SENTENCED AS IF HE OR SHE 

2368
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,929
HAD BEEN CONVICT OF ALL TEN. 

2369
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:50,165
BECAUSE THE JUDGE JUST SAYS 

2370
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:52,434
WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW, YOU 

2371
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,936
DID X OR Y AND UNDER MY 

2372
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:55,904
DISCRETION, WHEN YOU HAVE UNDER 

2373
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:57,606
THE SUPREME COURT'S CASE LAW 

2374
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:58,740
FOR SENTENCING, I'M GOING TO 

2375
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:01,242
SENTENCE YOU THE SAME ANYWAY. 

2376
01:18:01,242 --> 01:18:03,011
DEFENDANTS AND THE PUBLIC, THE 

2377
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,514
FAMILIES OF THE DEFENDANTS 

2378
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:06,414
UNDERSTANDABLY SAY THAT SEEMS 

2379
01:18:06,414 --> 01:18:06,647
UNFAIR. 

2380
01:18:06,647 --> 01:18:09,217
I THOUGHT THE POINT OF THE JURY 

2381
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:10,552
TRIAL WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER 

2382
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:12,954
I WAS GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY ON 

2383
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:13,521
ALL THOSE CHARGES. 

2384
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:17,459
IF I'M GETTING SENTENCED AS IF 

2385
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,227
I WERE GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES, 

2386
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:21,263
IT SEEMS A VIOLATION OF DREW 

2387
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:21,530
PROCESS. 

2388
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,065
I HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT THE 

2389
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:23,732
FAIRNESS AND PERCEIVED FAIRNESS 

2390
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:29,738
OF THE USE OF ACQUITTED CONDUCT 

2391
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:30,138
AT SENTENCING. 

2392
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:31,139
JUDGE MOLETT AND I HAVE WRITTEN 

2393
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:35,210
ABOUT IT SEVERAL TIMES AND MADE 

2394
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,512
CLEAR OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE USE 

2395
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:41,450
OF ACQUITTED CONDUCT AND HOW IT 

2396
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,384
AFFECTS THE SENTENCING SYSTEM. 

2397
01:18:43,384 --> 01:18:44,486
WHY I'VE SAID CONGRESS MIGHT 

2398
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:46,988
NEED TO LOOK AT IT, ALTHOUGH I 

2399
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,590
ALSO POINTED OUT INDIVIDUAL 

2400
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,292
DISTRICT JUDGES CAN LOOK AT IT, 

2401
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:52,594
IS BECAUSE UNDER THE CURRENT 

2402
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:53,895
SYSTEM, SENTENCING JUDGES HAVE 

2403
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,298
WIDE DISCRETION IN PICKING 

2404
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:56,598
SENTENCES. 

2405
01:18:56,598 --> 01:19:00,068
IT'S HARD FOR AN APPEALS COURT 

2406
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:06,742
TO SAY THAT YOU INFRINGED YOUR 

2407
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,042
DISCRETION. 

2408
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:08,643
I DON'T LIKE THE PRACTICE AND I 

2409
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:10,544
MADE THAT CLEAR IN MY OPINION. 

2410
01:19:10,544 --> 01:19:12,848
I'M REPEATING MY OPINIONS HERE, 

2411
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:14,983
BECAUSE OF THE UNFAIRNESS AND 

2412
01:19:14,983 --> 01:19:15,550
PERCEIVED UNFAIRNESS OF IT. 

2413
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:16,885
>>  OKAY. 

2414
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:19,120
THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN CHASING 

2415
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,722
AN ELUSIVE DEAL ON CRIMINAL 

2416
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:23,225
JUSTICE REFORM FOR QUITE SOME 

2417
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:24,125
TIME NOW. 

2418
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:24,959
ONE PARTICULAR FOCUS OF LINE IN 

2419
01:19:24,959 --> 01:19:31,399
THIS AREA HAS BEEN MEN'S RAYA 

2420
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:31,700
REFORM. 

2421
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:32,334
WITHOUT PROTECTIONS, THAT IS 

2422
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:34,502
WITHOUT THE REQUIREMENT THAT A 

2423
01:19:34,502 --> 01:19:36,838
PERSON KNOW HIS CONDUCT WAS 

2424
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:38,373
WRONG OR UNLAWFUL. 

2425
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:39,674
EVERY DAY CITIZENS CAN BE HELD 

2426
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:41,009
CRIMINALLY LIABLE FOR A CONDUCT 

2427
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:44,179
THAT NO REASONABLE PERSON WOULD 

2428
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:44,579
KNOW WAS WRONG. 

2429
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:45,980
CRITICS IN MY LEGISLATIVE 

2430
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:49,084
EFFORTS TO BRING CLARITY CLAIM 

2431
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:51,119
THE EFFORT IS A PLOY TO GET 

2432
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,520
CORPORATIONS AND WHITE COLLAR 

2433
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,322
DEFENDANTS OFF THE HOOK. 

2434
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:57,125
BUT STRONGER MEN'S RAYA 

2435
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:57,726
REQUIREMENTS PROTECT THE 

2436
01:19:57,726 --> 01:20:00,595
LIBERTY OF ALL DEFENDANTS IN 

2437
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:02,063
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. 

2438
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:04,532
THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE 

2439
01:20:04,532 --> 01:20:07,435
NOT CORPORATIONS OR WHITE 

2440
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:07,936
COLLAR DEFENDANTS. 

2441
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,505
YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THE 

2442
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:11,539
IMPORTANCE OF REQUIREMENTS, 

2443
01:20:11,539 --> 01:20:13,408
INCLUDING IN CASES INVOLVING 

2444
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:15,010
UNSYMPATHETIC DEFENDANTS LIKE 

2445
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:18,246
AN ARMED ROBBER OR A CONVICTED 

2446
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:18,479
MURDER. 

2447
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:21,716
WHY IN YOUR VIEW ARE 

2448
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:23,485
REQUIREMENTS SO IMPORTANT? 

2449
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,087
>>  REQUIREMENTS ARE IMPORTANT, 

2450
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:28,156
BUT BECAUSE UNDER THE DUE 

2451
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:29,190
PROCESS CLAUSE AND THE 

2452
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:30,458
PRECEDENCE OF THE SUPREME 

2453
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:32,460
COURT, IT IS NOT RIGHT TO 

2454
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:35,130
CONVICT SOMEONE BASED ON A FACT 

2455
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,065
THEY DID NOT KNOW. 

2456
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:43,238
IT'S JUST AN ELEMENTAL POINT OF 

2457
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:44,205
DUE PROCESS. 

2458
01:20:44,205 --> 01:20:47,142
JUSTICE JACKSON DESCRIBED THIS. 

2459
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:48,243
IT SAYS ELEMENTARY, AS HE SAID, 

2460
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:50,712
IS THE SCHOOL CHILD'S, I DIDN'T 

2461
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:50,979
MEAN TO. 

2462
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,747
I DIDN'T KNOW. 

2463
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:55,183
AND IF SOMEONE TRULY DIDN'T 

2464
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:59,020
KNOW A FACT THAT IS RELEVANT TO 

2465
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,256
THEIR CONVICTION TO NONETHELESS 

2466
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:06,494
CONVICT THEM, IS CONTRARY TO 

2467
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:06,827
DUE PROCESS. 

2468
01:21:06,827 --> 01:21:07,795
MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE WAS 

2469
01:21:07,795 --> 01:21:10,632
ELEVATED FROM 10 YEARS TO 30 

2470
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:10,999
YEARS. 

2471
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:13,001
30 YEAR MANDATORY MINIMUM BASED 

2472
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,203
ON A FACT THAT THE DEFENDANT 

2473
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:16,071
DID NOT KNOW. 

2474
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:19,107
I DECENTED IN THAT CASE, AND 

2475
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:21,276
JOINED BY JUDGE TATAL, WHO IS 

2476
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:22,677
AN APPOINTEE OF PRESIDENT 

2477
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:31,252
CLINTON TO OUR COURT, SAYING -- 

2478
01:21:31,252 --> 01:21:35,223
I WROTE A LENGTHY -- THAT WAS 

2479
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,658
NOT A SYMPATHETIC DEFENDANT, 

2480
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:37,859
GIVEN WHAT HE HAD BEEN 

2481
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:38,192
CONVICTED OF. 

2482
01:21:38,192 --> 01:21:41,329
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS A COMPLETE 

2483
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:43,832
VIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS AND 

2484
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:45,934
PRINCIPLES THAT WERE LONG 

2485
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:49,137
STANDING TO GIVE HIM A 30 YEAR 

2486
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:50,872
MANDATORY MINIMUM FOR A FACT HE 

2487
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:52,407
DID NOT KNOW. 

2488
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,609
I HAVE ALSO WROTE, OR JOINED AN 

2489
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,978
OPINION AND WROTE A SEPARATE 

2490
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:59,314
OPINION REVERSING A MURDER 

2491
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:01,216
CONVICTION OF SOMEONE WHERE THE 

2492
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:02,884
JURY INSTRUCTIONS WERE UNCLEAR 

2493
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:06,454
ABOUT THE MENTAL STATE OF THE 

2494
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:06,721
MURDER. 

2495
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:08,589
IT WAS A QUESTION OF 

2496
01:22:08,589 --> 01:22:10,358
MANSLAUGHTER VERSUS 2nd DEGREE 

2497
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:10,658
MURDER. 

2498
01:22:10,658 --> 01:22:12,060
THAT WOULD HAVE A HUGE 

2499
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:13,862
DIFFERENCE IN THE DEFENDANT'S 

2500
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:14,162
SENTENCE. 

2501
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:17,665
AND I WROTE AN OPINION SAYING 

2502
01:22:17,665 --> 01:22:19,167
THIS WAS NOT A SYMPATHETIC 

2503
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,202
CASE, GIVEN THE FACTS. 

2504
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:22,237
THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS WERE 

2505
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,939
FLAWED ON THE ISSUE OF THE 

2506
01:22:24,939 --> 01:22:25,272
MENTAL STATE. 

2507
01:22:25,272 --> 01:22:27,108
AND MY EXACT LINE WAS, I'M 

2508
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:28,710
UNWILLING TO SWEEP THAT UNDER 

2509
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:30,712
THE RUG AND THAT'S HOW I FELT 

2510
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:31,312
ABOUT THAT CASE. 

2511
01:22:31,312 --> 01:22:34,282
THERE WAS A DECENT IN THAT 

2512
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:34,482
CASE. 

2513
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:36,584
BUT I WAS IN THE MAJORITY. 

2514
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:39,220
NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE IN MY 

2515
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,624
COURT, IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT 

2516
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,392
ARGUMENT ON THE LAW, I'M GOING 

2517
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:47,295
TO RULE IN YOUR FAVOR AND IT'S 

2518
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:48,762
FOUNDATIONAL TO DUE PROCESS. 

2519
01:22:48,762 --> 01:22:50,732
I HAVE WRITTEN THAT REPEATEDLY 

2520
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:52,567
AND I SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT 

2521
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:53,067
REFORM, SENATOR HATCH. 

2522
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:54,035
>>  THANK YOU. 

2523
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:55,536
I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION. 

2524
01:22:55,536 --> 01:22:57,572
SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK THAT 

2525
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:58,573
RELIGIOUS PEOPLE SHOULD NOT 

2526
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:01,209
WORK IN GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY 

2527
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:02,777
SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO THEIR 

2528
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:06,081
CHURCH, NOT THEIR COUNTRY, 

2529
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:06,414
NECESSARILY. 

2530
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:08,683
I HAVE FAITHLY SERVED OVER 40 

2531
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:08,916
YEARS. 

2532
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:10,718
I BELIEVE I'M A RELIGIOUS 

2533
01:23:10,718 --> 01:23:10,952
PERSON. 

2534
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:12,887
NOW RELIGION IS ALSO A BIG PART 

2535
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:14,122
OF YOUR LIFE. 

2536
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:15,356
YOU WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL. 

2537
01:23:15,356 --> 01:23:17,325
YOUR CHILDREN GO TO CATHOLIC 

2538
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:17,558
SCHOOL. 

2539
01:23:17,558 --> 01:23:22,530
AND YOU REGULARLY ATTEND CHURCH 

2540
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:26,601
AND SERVE AT A CHURCH SUPPORTED 

2541
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:26,934
SOUP KITCHEN. 

2542
01:23:26,934 --> 01:23:28,803
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU 

2543
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:31,906
HOW YOUR PRIVATE BELIEFS AFFECT 

2544
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:32,507
YOUR PUBLIC DECISIONS. 

2545
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:35,310
CAN YOU BE DEVOUT IN YOUR FAITH 

2546
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,110
AND STILL UPHOLD THE LAW? 

2547
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:38,913
>>  SENATOR, MY RELIGIOUS 

2548
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:41,616
BELIEFS HAVE NO RELEVANCE TO MY 

2549
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:41,983
JUDGING. 

2550
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:44,052
I JUDGE BASED ON THE 

2551
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:45,754
CONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF THE 

2552
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:46,121
UNITED STATES. 

2553
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:48,756
I TAKE AN OATH TO DO THAT. 

2554
01:23:48,756 --> 01:23:50,959
FOR 12 YEARS, I LIVED UP TO 

2555
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:51,259
THAT OATH. 

2556
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:55,363
AT THE SAME TIME, OF COURSE, AS 

2557
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:59,134
YOU POINT OUT, I AM RELIGIOUS 

2558
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:02,036
AND I AM A CATHOLIC AND I GREW 

2559
01:24:02,036 --> 01:24:04,472
UP ATTENDING CATHOLIC SCHOOLS. 

2560
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,608
AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE 

2561
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,610
UNITED STATES FIRST SAW 

2562
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,345
RELIGIOUS PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WHO 

2563
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:12,814
ARE NOT RELIGIOUS, ARE ALL 

2564
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:16,317
EQUALLY AMERICAN, AS I'VE SAID, 

2565
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:19,154
NO MATTER WHAT RELIGION YOU ARE 

2566
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:22,157
OR NO RELIGION AT ALL, WE'RE 

2567
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:23,758
ALL EQUALLY AMERICAN AND THE 

2568
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:25,193
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED

2569
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:27,962
STATES ALSO SAYS IN ARTICLE 6, 

2570
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:29,430
NO RELIGIOUS TESTS SHALL EVER 

2571
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:31,132
BE REQUIRED AS A QUALIFICATION 

2572
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:33,735
TO ANY OFFICE OR PUBLIC TRUST 

2573
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:34,468
UNDER THE UNITED STATES. 

2574
01:24:34,468 --> 01:24:36,037
THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT PROVISION 

2575
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:39,207
TO HAVE IN THE FOUNDING 

2576
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:41,242
CONSTITUTION TO ENSURE THAT 

2577
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,710
THERE WAS NOT DEDISCRIMINATION 

2578
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,012
AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAD A 

2579
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:45,914
RELIGION OR PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T 

2580
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:46,814
HAVE A RELIGION. 

2581
01:24:46,814 --> 01:24:48,616
IT'S A FOUNDATION OF OUR 

2582
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:49,250
COUNTRY. 

2583
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,318
WE'RE ALL EQUALLY AMERICAN. 

2584
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:52,153
>>  THANK YOU. 

2585
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:55,489
>>  SENATOR LEAHY. 

2586
01:24:55,489 --> 01:24:58,125
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2587
01:24:58,125 --> 01:25:00,327
AS I MENTIONED TO YOU EARLIER, 

2588
01:25:00,327 --> 01:25:06,568
I HAVE A NUMBER OF LETTERS THAT 

2589
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:08,136
HAVE BEEN ASKED TO BE PLACED, 

2590
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:11,639
AS WELL AS E-MAILS AT 3:00 THIS 

2591
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:11,906
MORNING. 

2592
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:12,773
THEY BE PLACED IN RECORD. 

2593
01:25:12,773 --> 01:25:14,041
>>  WITHOUT OBJECTION. 

2594
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:20,882
>>  THANK YOU. I KNOW THERE WAS 

2595
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:22,050
CLAIM THIS MORNING THE 

2596
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:25,153
COMMITTEE WAS FOLLOWING MY 

2597
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:29,958
PRECEDENT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, NOT 

2598
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:30,124
SO. 

2599
01:25:30,124 --> 01:25:33,761
JUSTICE KAGAN, WE HAD 99% OF 

2600
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:35,897
HER DOCUMENTS AT THE WHITE 

2601
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:39,933
HOUSE, AND OF COURSE, WE DO NOT 

2602
01:25:39,933 --> 01:25:45,039
HAVE -- WE HAVE LESS THAN 10% 

2603
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:46,140
OF YOURS. 

2604
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,743
THERE WERE 860 DOCUMENTS 

2605
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:52,046
DESIGNATED BY THE NONPARTISAN 

2606
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:52,914
ARCHIVES THAT WAS DISCUSSED 

2607
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:54,849
WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS 

2608
01:25:54,849 --> 01:25:55,449
ON THE COMMITTEE. 

2609
01:25:55,449 --> 01:25:58,853
NOBODY OBJECTED TO THAT. 

2610
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:01,389
LET'S GO TO OUR QUESTIONS 

2611
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:01,689
YESTERDAY. 

2612
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:02,757
WE DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT 

2613
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:04,892
WHILE YOU WORKED ON NOMINATIONS 

2614
01:26:04,892 --> 01:26:08,663
IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE, YOU 

2615
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,065
RECEIVED STOLEN MATERIAL FROM A 

2616
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:14,469
REPUBLICAN STAFFER NAMED MANDY 

2617
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:14,736
MIRANDA. 

2618
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:19,174
I THOUGHT IT WAS A DIGITAL 

2619
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,242
WATER GATE. 

2620
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:25,546
HE STOLE 4,670 COMPUTER FILES 

2621
01:26:25,546 --> 01:26:26,113
FROM SENATORS. 

2622
01:26:26,113 --> 01:26:29,050
HE WAS DOING THIS IN AN EFFORT 

2623
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:32,187
TO CONFIRM PRESIDENT GEORGE W. 

2624
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:35,690
BUSH'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL 

2625
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:36,191
JUDICIAL NOMINEES. 

2626
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,192
SOME OF THE MOST CONTENTION 

2627
01:26:38,192 --> 01:26:43,665
FIGHTS OF THE DAY, AND THIS 

2628
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:47,001
REPUBLICAN STOLE 4, 670 

2629
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:47,569
COMPUTER FILES. 

2630
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:49,470
IN 2004 AND 2006, YOU TESTIFIED 

2631
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:52,840
A NUMBER OF SENATORS, BOTH 

2632
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,875
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ASKED 

2633
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,944
YOU, YOU SAID YOU NEVER 

2634
01:26:56,944 --> 01:26:57,845
RECEIVED ANY STOLEN MATERIALS. 

2635
01:26:57,845 --> 01:27:01,049
THAT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE 

2636
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:01,316
ACCURATE. 

2637
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:03,451
YOU ALSO TESTIFIED THAT YOU 

2638
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:06,688
KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE SCANDAL 

2639
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:10,391
UNTIL IT WAS PUBLIC AND IF YOU 

2640
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,393
HAD SUSPECTED ANYTHING, YOU 

2641
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:13,627
WOULD HAVE REPORTED IT. 

2642
01:27:13,627 --> 01:27:15,096
YOU ALSO TESTIFIED TO SENATOR 

2643
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:17,498
HATCH THAT YOU NEVER RECEIVED 

2644
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:19,300
ANY DOCUMENT, EVEN APPEARED TO 

2645
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:24,839
HAVE BEEN DRAFTED OR PREPARED 

2646
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:25,573
BY DEMOCRATIC STAFF. 

2647
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:27,642
I ALSO ASKED YOU YESTERDAY, 

2648
01:27:27,642 --> 01:27:30,244
WHETHER MR. MIRANDA ASKED TO 

2649
01:27:30,244 --> 01:27:31,946

01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:41,689
I ALSO ASKED ABOUT SENDING YOU 

2653
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:43,224
QUOTE, INTELL. 

2654
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:44,092
WITH EXTRAORDINARY DETAILED 

2655
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:46,794
SPECIFICS ABOUT WHAT I WAS 

2656
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:48,496

CONTROVERSIAL NOMINEE JUST DAYS 

2658
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:50,098
LATER. 

2659
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,700
SOMETHING I NEVER SAID 

2660
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:52,967
PUBLICLY. 

2661
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:55,203
I ALSO ASKED ABOUT YOU 

2662
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:57,939
RECEIVING A DRAFT IN NONPUBLIC 

2663
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:00,174
LETTER OF MINE, BEFORE ANY 

2664
01:28:00,174 --> 01:28:02,209
MENTION IT WAS MADE PUBLIC. 

2665
01:28:02,209 --> 01:28:04,278
YOU TESTIFIED YOU DIDN'T RECALL 

2666
01:28:04,278 --> 01:28:06,948
ANYTHING SPECIFIC, BUT YOU 

2667
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,549
THOUGHT SHARING INFORMATION 

2668
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:11,219
BETWEEN STAFF WAS COMMON. 

2669
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:18,693
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 

2670
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:20,128
HAS ANYONE TOLD YOU WHAT 

2671
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,295
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS HAVE BEEN 

2672
01:28:21,295 --> 01:28:24,531
ADVISED TO DO BY OUR STAFF AT 

2673
01:28:24,531 --> 01:28:24,898
THIS HEARING? 

2674
01:28:24,898 --> 01:28:34,342
>>  I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT 

2675
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:36,878
OF -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF 

2676
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:38,646
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT 

2677
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:43,184
INDIVIDUAL SENATORS MIGHT BE 

2678
01:28:43,184 --> 01:28:43,618
INTERESTED IN. 

2679
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:43,985
WHEN I MET -- 

2680
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:46,788
>>  I WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU 

2681
01:28:46,788 --> 01:28:51,325
HAVE TO SAY, JUDGE, PROTESTERS 

2682
01:28:51,325 --> 01:28:56,397
-- PLEASE GO AHEAD. 

2683
01:28:56,397 --> 01:28:57,398
ANY DEMOCRATIC SENATORS HAVE 

2684
01:28:57,398 --> 01:28:58,900
BEEN ADVISED TO DO AT THIS 

2685
01:28:58,900 --> 01:28:59,167
HEARING? 

2686
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:03,604
>>  WHEN I MET INDIVIDUALLY 

2687
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:06,374
WITH THE 65 SENATORS, INCLUDING 

2688
01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:08,276
ALMOST EVERY MEMBER OF THE 

2689
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:10,144
COMMITTEE, A LOT OF THE 

2690
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,679
SENATORS, A LOT OF YOU IN THE 

2691
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:14,282
MEETINGS TOLD ME ISSUES YOU ARE 

2692
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:14,749
INTERESTED IN. 

2693
01:29:14,749 --> 01:29:18,185
I THINK YOUR STAFF WAS PROBABLY 

2694
01:29:18,185 --> 01:29:18,552
TALKING TO -- 

2695
01:29:18,552 --> 01:29:20,688
>>  HAS ANYBODY SAID TO YOU, 

2696
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:23,291
FOR EXAMPLE, SENATOR LEAHY'S 

2697
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:25,326
STAFF IS ASKING HIM TO DO THIS 

2698
01:29:25,326 --> 01:29:26,193
AT THE HEARING TOMORROW. 

2699
01:29:26,193 --> 01:29:28,296
>>  WELL, I THINK YOU, 

2700
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:30,298
YOURSELF, TOLD ME WHAT YOU WERE 

2701
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:30,665
GOING TO ASK. 

2702
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:34,001
>>  NO, I TRIED TO GIVE YOU A 

2703
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:34,869
GOOD HEAD'S UP. 

2704
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:35,836
I APPRECIATE THE MEETING. 

2705
01:29:35,836 --> 01:29:39,073
BUT HAS ANYBODY ELSE TOLD YOU, 

2706
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:41,776
THIS IS WHAT LEAHY'S STAFF IS 

2707
01:29:41,776 --> 01:29:44,211
ASKING HIM TO ASK AT THE 

2708
01:29:44,211 --> 01:29:44,612
HEARING TOMORROW. 

2709
01:29:44,612 --> 01:29:46,948
>>  AGAIN, I THINK THIS MIGHT 

2710
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:49,216
BE A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROCESS. 

2711
01:29:49,216 --> 01:29:50,985
YOU ALL WERE VERY TRANSPARENT 

2712
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:52,386
WHEN I MET WITH YOU. 

2713
01:29:52,386 --> 01:29:53,621
I'M LOOKING AROUND AND SAYING 

2714
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:55,323
HERE'S WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON AND 

2715
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:56,290
HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO ASK 

2716
01:29:56,290 --> 01:30:00,094
YOU AT THE HEARINGS. 

2717
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:02,330
YOU WERE ACCURATELY TELLING ME 

2718
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:02,697
YOUR CONCERNS. 

2719
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:05,800
>>  YOU ARE SAYING THAT'S 

2720
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:06,033
NORMAL. 

2721
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:09,103
ANYBODY HAND YOU ANYTHING 

2722
01:30:09,103 --> 01:30:09,871
MARKED HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL 

2723
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:11,372
ABOUT ANY ONE OF THESE 

2724
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:11,639
SENATORS? 

2725
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:13,674
>>  NO. 

2726
01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:15,676
NOT REMEMBERING ANYTHING LIKE 

2727
01:30:15,676 --> 01:30:15,876
THAT. 

2728
01:30:15,876 --> 01:30:17,611
YOU ALL DID TALK ABOUT THE 

2729
01:30:17,611 --> 01:30:17,979
ISSUES. 

2730
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:21,983
IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE NO 

2731
01:30:21,983 --> 01:30:22,283
SURPRISES. 

2732
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:24,919
YOU KNOW, YOU GAVE ME A BASIC 

2733
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:25,386
CONCERNS AND ISSUES. 

2734
01:30:25,386 --> 01:30:28,189
>>  I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE 

2735
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:29,490
CLEAR ON THIS. 

2736
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:32,493
NOBODY HANDED YOU SOMETHING 

2737
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:33,060
MARKED HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL. 

2738
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:36,097
BUT THAT IS MATERIAL YOU 

2739
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:36,630
RECEIVED FROM MIRANDA.

2740
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:40,501
FOR EXAMPLE, ON JULY 18, 2002, 

2741
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:42,870
DAYS BEFORE AN EXTREMELY 

2742
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:49,210
CONTROVERSIAL HEARING FOR THIS 

2743
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:55,716
SUR CIRCUIT. 

2744
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:56,184
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL. 

2745
01:30:56,184 --> 01:30:59,220
ASKING BIDEN NOT TO ATTEND THE 

2746
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:04,625
MEETING THAT DAY. 

2747
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:07,028
ON MARCH 18, 2003, MR. MIRANDA 

2748
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:10,298
SENT YOU SEVERAL PAGES OF 

2749
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:11,331
TALKING POINTS. 

2750
01:31:11,331 --> 01:31:14,167
THEY WERE STOLEN VERBATIM. 

2751
01:31:14,167 --> 01:31:17,504
STOLEN FROM DEMOCRATIC FILES. 

2752
01:31:17,504 --> 01:31:20,074
TALKING POINTS REVEALED 

2753
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:22,076
ARGUMENTS DEMOCRATS WERE MAKING 

2754
01:31:22,076 --> 01:31:24,879
ON ANOTHER CONTROVERSIAL 

2755
01:31:24,879 --> 01:31:25,412
NOMINEE, MIGUEL ESTRADA. 

2756
01:31:25,412 --> 01:31:29,349
THE SUBJECT LINE SAID NOT FOR 

2757
01:31:29,349 --> 01:31:29,683
DISTRIBUTION. 

2758
01:31:29,683 --> 01:31:31,919
MEANING MR. MIRANDA WAS ASKING 

2759
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:34,221
YOU NOT TO SHARE THE 

2760
01:31:34,221 --> 01:31:34,722
INFORMATION. 

2761
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:37,325
THIS HAS NOW BEEN AS OF 3:00 

2762
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:38,859
THIS MORNING, MADE PUBLIC. 

2763
01:31:38,859 --> 01:31:41,195
SO YESTERDAY WHEN I ASKED YOU 

2764
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:42,029
ABOUT THE SPECIFIC EVENTS, YOU 

2765
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:43,631
SAID YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY 

2766
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:43,964
RECOLLECTION. 

2767
01:31:43,964 --> 01:31:46,267
SO, I'M NOT GOING TO ASK IF YOU 

2768
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:48,235
REMEMBER RECEIVING THIS E-MAIL. 

2769
01:31:48,235 --> 01:31:49,670
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU THIS. 

2770
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:54,175
WHY WOULD YOU EVER BE ASKED TO 

2771
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,776
KEEP A SECRET, DEMOCRATIC 

2772
01:31:55,776 --> 01:32:01,248
TALKING POINTS, IF THEY ARE 

2773
01:32:01,248 --> 01:32:01,748
LEGITIMATELY OBTAINED? 

2774
01:32:01,748 --> 01:32:04,819
>>  I AM LOOKING AT THESE, 

2775
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:06,420
SENATOR, IT SAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, 

2776
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:08,522
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT BIDEN STAFF 

2777
01:32:08,522 --> 01:32:11,425
IS ASKING HIM NOT TO ATTEND THE 

2778
01:32:11,425 --> 01:32:11,692
HEARING. 

2779
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:12,225
I DON'T KNOW WHY -- 

2780
01:32:12,225 --> 01:32:14,328
>>  LOOK HOW YOU RECEIVED IT. 

2781
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:18,232
>>  I KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHY 

2782
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:18,699
THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL. 

2783
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,835
>>  WHETHER IT IS OR NOT, WOULD 

2784
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:22,236
YOU CONSIDER THAT UNUSUAL TO BE 

2785
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:23,904
RECEIVING FROM A REPUBLICAN 

2786
01:32:23,904 --> 01:32:25,806
STAFF MEMBER, SOMETHING MARKED 

2787
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:26,607
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL, TELLING 

2788
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:28,275
WHAT HE HAS FOUND OUT WHAT THE 

2789
01:32:28,275 --> 01:32:29,110
DEMOCRAT WILL DO? 

2790
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:30,978
>>  AS I EXPLAINED YESTERDAY, 

2791
01:32:30,978 --> 01:32:33,280
SENATOR, MY UNDERSTANDING OF 

2792
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,916
THIS PROCESS IS THAT THE STAFF 

2793
01:32:34,916 --> 01:32:36,183
DO TALK WITH ONE ANOTHER. 

2794
01:32:36,183 --> 01:32:39,520
THEY ARE NOT CAMPS WITH NO 

2795
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:39,887
COMMUNICATION. 

2796
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:40,922
AND THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE WHEN 

2797
01:32:40,922 --> 01:32:43,557
I WORKED IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

2798
01:32:43,557 --> 01:32:45,626
SO IT LOOKS LIKE BIDEN STAFF IS 

2799
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:47,428
ASKING HIM NOT TO ATTEND THE 

2800
01:32:47,428 --> 01:32:51,265
HEARING WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY 

2801
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:51,766
STANDARD INFORMATION. 

2802
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:53,134
>>  NOT REALLY. 

2803
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:53,534
YOU READ THIS. 

2804
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:56,437
I WOULD BE AMAZED IF SOMEBODY 

2805
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:59,473
HANDED ME A MEMO SAYING THIS IS 

2806
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:02,209
A CONFIDENTIAL MEMO. 

2807
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:04,511
SENATOR GRASSLEY'S STAFF 

2808
01:33:04,511 --> 01:33:04,945
PREPARED FOR HIM. 

2809
01:33:04,945 --> 01:33:06,614
I WOULD BE ON THE PHONE 

2810
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:08,883
IMMEDIATELY TO SENATOR GRASSLEY 

2811
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:09,817
SAYING, I'M BRINGING SOMETHING 

2812
01:33:09,817 --> 01:33:12,053
OVER THAT JUST ARRIVED TO ME, 

2813
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:15,489
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT IT. 

2814
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:18,125
YOU RECEIVED, ON JULY 28, 2002, 

2815
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:19,226
AN E-MAIL FROM MIRANDA THAT 

2816
01:33:19,226 --> 01:33:21,529
SAID MY STAFF DISTRIBUTED A 

2817
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:22,930
CONFIDENTIAL LETTER TO 

2818
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:25,833
DEMOCRATIC COUNSELORS, NOT TO 

2819
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:26,166
REPUBLICANS. 

2820
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:27,234
MR. MIRANDA SAID, I RECEIVED 

2821
01:33:27,234 --> 01:33:32,106
THAT LETTER IN THE STRICTEST 

2822
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:33,441
CONFIDENCE. 

2823
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,009
YOU WERE ASKED EXPLICITLY BY 

2824
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:37,411
MR. MIRANDA TO TAKE NO ACTION 

2825
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:43,317
ON THE E-MAIL WITHOUT HIS, HIS 

2826
01:33:43,317 --> 01:33:43,850
FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. 

2827
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:47,221
NEVER ASKED HOW HE OBTAINED THE 

2828
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:49,223
LETTER TO ME. 

2829
01:33:49,223 --> 01:33:51,225
AND JULY 30, 2002, YOU RECEIVED 

2830
01:33:51,225 --> 01:33:54,161
AN E-MAIL FROM MIRANDA SAYING 

2831
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:55,229
THEY HAD 100% INFORMATION THAT 

2832
01:33:55,229 --> 01:34:01,268
I WAS GOING TO BE THE COMMITTEE 

2833
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:06,006
ABOUT A CONTROVERSIAL NOMINEE 

2834
01:34:06,006 --> 01:34:11,345
AND THEN FURTHER IN AUGUST, E-

2835
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:15,516
MAILING TAKEN FROM MY INTERNAL 

2836
01:34:15,516 --> 01:34:19,519
E-MAILS WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO. 

2837
01:34:19,519 --> 01:34:22,823
DID ANY OF THIS RAISE A RED 

2838
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:23,290
FLAG IN YOUR MIND? 

2839
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:27,161
>>  IT DID NOT, SENATOR, IT ALL 

2840
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:29,263
SEEMED CONSISTENT WITH THE 

2841
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:31,132
USUAL KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS THAT 

2842
01:34:31,132 --> 01:34:31,365
HAPPEN. 

2843
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:33,567
SOMETIMES, PEOPLE DO SAY THINGS 

2844
01:34:33,567 --> 01:34:35,035
OF, HERE'S WHAT MY BOSS IS 

2845
01:34:35,035 --> 01:34:38,205
THINKING, BUT DON'T SHARE IT 

2846
01:34:38,205 --> 01:34:38,706
AROUND. 

2847
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:41,041
I MUST HAVE HAD, YOU KNOW, SO 

2848
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:42,042
MANY CONVERSATIONS IN THE 

2849
01:34:42,042 --> 01:34:43,644
COURSE OF MY LIFE LIKE THAT, 

2850
01:34:43,644 --> 01:34:45,613
WHERE SOMEONE IS SAYING LIKE 

2851
01:34:45,613 --> 01:34:46,080
THAT ABOUT SOMETHING. 

2852
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,114
IN OTHER WORDS, TRYING TO GIVE 

2853
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:50,117
YOU A HEAD'S UP ON SOMETHING. 

2854
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:53,154
AND THAT JUST SEEMED STANDARD 

2855
01:34:53,154 --> 01:34:53,487
SENATE STAFF. 

2856
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:55,155
SO THE DIRECT ANSWER TO YOUR 

2857
01:34:55,155 --> 01:34:58,926
QUESTION IS, FOR EXAMPLE, BIDEN 

2858
01:34:58,926 --> 01:35:00,461
-- LOOKS LIKE BIDEN'S STAFF IS 

2859
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:02,229
NOT ASKING HIM NOT TO ATTEND 

2860
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:02,596
THE HEARING. 

2861
01:35:02,596 --> 01:35:03,430
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE RAISED 

2862
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:08,501
ANYTHING AT ALL FOR ME. 

2863
01:35:08,501 --> 01:35:08,835
OTHER THAN -- 

2864
01:35:08,835 --> 01:35:11,939
>>  ON JUNE 5, 2003, YOU 

2865
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:15,309
RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM 

2866
01:35:15,309 --> 01:35:15,909
REPUBLICAN SENATOR STAFFER 

2867
01:35:15,909 --> 01:35:21,716
HOSE SUBJECT LINE, SPYING. 

2868
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:25,085
THAT IS NOT OVERLY SUBTLE. 

2869
01:35:25,085 --> 01:35:27,955
THIS STAFFER APPEARS IN OVER 

2870
01:35:27,955 --> 01:35:28,355
1,000 DOCUMENTS. 

2871
01:35:28,355 --> 01:35:30,724
RECEIVED TOGETHER WITH YOU AND 

2872
01:35:30,724 --> 01:35:35,262
MR. MIRANDA, SHE HAS A  MOLE 

2873
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:36,664
FOR US, AND SO FORTH. 

2874
01:35:36,664 --> 01:35:38,132
NONE OF THIS RAISED A RED FLAG 

2875
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:38,432
WITH YOU? 

2876
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:42,136
>>  IT DID NOT, SENATOR. 

2877
01:35:42,136 --> 01:35:43,137
AGAIN, PEOPLE HAVE FRIENDS 

2878
01:35:43,137 --> 01:35:44,939
ACROSS THE AISLE WHO THEY TALK 

2879
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:45,105
TO. 

2880
01:35:45,105 --> 01:35:47,041
AT LEAST THIS WAS MY EXPERIENCE 

2881
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:50,611
BACK THEN. 

2882
01:35:50,611 --> 01:35:51,078
MAYBE IT'S CHANGED. 

2883
01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:52,313
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF 

2884
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:54,415
BIPARTISANSHIP ON THE 

2885
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:54,715
COMMITTEE. 

2886
01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:55,449
THERE WAS A LOT OF 

2887
01:35:55,449 --> 01:35:56,317
BIPARTISANSHIP AMONG THE 

2888
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:56,717
STAFFS. 

2889
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:57,851
A LOT OF FRIENDSHIPS AND 

2890
01:35:57,851 --> 01:35:59,954
RELATIONSHIPS WHERE PEOPLE 

2891
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:02,623
WOULD TALK TO -- I HAVE A 

2892
01:36:02,623 --> 01:36:04,758
FRIEND ON SENATOR KENNEDY'S 

2893
01:36:04,758 --> 01:36:07,528
STAFF, OR I HAVE A FRIEND ON 

2894
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:08,762
SENATOR HATCH'S STAFF. 

2895
01:36:08,762 --> 01:36:14,668
OR I HAVE A FRIEND ON SENATOR 

2896
01:36:14,668 --> 01:36:15,068
SPECTOR'S STAFF. 

2897
01:36:15,068 --> 01:36:17,170
SO IT DID NOT RAISE A FLAG. 

2898
01:36:17,170 --> 01:36:19,940
>>  JUDGE, I WAS BORN AT NIGHT, 

2899
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:22,542
BUT NOT LAST NIGHT. 

2900
01:36:22,542 --> 01:36:25,212
IF I HAD SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE 

2901
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:27,314
SAID, WE STOLEN THIS, OR DON'T 

2902
01:36:27,314 --> 01:36:29,216
TELL ANYBODY WE HAVE THIS. 

2903
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:32,052
I THINK IT WOULD RAISE SOME RED 

2904
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:32,285
FLAGS. 

2905
01:36:32,285 --> 01:36:35,990
NOW, WE ONLY HAVE A FRACTION OF 

2906
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:36,857
YOUR RECORD. 

2907
01:36:36,857 --> 01:36:39,760
I DO THANK THE CHAIRMAN FOR 

2908
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,162
OPENING THESE UP AT 3:00 THIS 

2909
01:36:42,162 --> 01:36:43,264
MORNING. 

2910
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,467
AS YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT HAS 

2911
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:47,334
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, THE FIRST 

2912
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:50,437
TIME WE'VE HAD TO FACE THIS ON 

2913
01:36:50,437 --> 01:36:53,807
A NOMINEE FROM EITHER 

2914
01:36:53,807 --> 01:36:56,243
REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS. 

2915
01:36:56,243 --> 01:36:59,579
OF 102,000 PAGES OF MATERIAL. 

2916
01:36:59,579 --> 01:37:03,184
102,000, FROM JUST YOUR TIME IN 

2917
01:37:03,184 --> 01:37:06,520
THE WHITE HOUSE. 

2918
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:09,056
THAT INCLUDES JUDICIAL 

2919
01:37:09,056 --> 01:37:09,389
NOMINATIONS. 

2920
01:37:09,389 --> 01:37:12,660
CAN YOU CONFIRM FOR ME TODAY 

2921
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:15,262
THAT IN THAT 102,000 PAGES, 

2922
01:37:15,262 --> 01:37:19,232
THERE ARE NO E-MAILS FROM MR. 

2923
01:37:19,232 --> 01:37:20,100
MIRANDA MARKED HIGHLY 

2924
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:24,438
CONFIDENTIAL OR DO NOT SHARE OR 

2925
01:37:24,438 --> 01:37:26,040
TAKE NO ACTION ON THIS, 

2926
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,442
DESCRIBING WHAT HE HAS FOUND 

2927
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:31,312
OUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE THINKING. 

2928
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:33,247
>>  SENATOR, I AM NOT INVOLVED 

2929
01:37:33,247 --> 01:37:35,215
IN THE DOCUMENTS PROCESS. 

2930
01:37:35,215 --> 01:37:43,090
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THEM. 

2931
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:47,861
>>  THAT IS CONVENIENT. 

2932
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:49,763
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN 

2933
01:37:49,763 --> 01:37:50,096
THEM EITHER. 

2934
01:37:50,096 --> 01:37:51,866
WE HAVE NEVER HAD SO MUCH 

2935
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:52,266
WITHHELD BEFORE. 

2936
01:37:52,266 --> 01:37:54,468
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN ALL 

2937
01:37:54,468 --> 01:37:54,835
THE DOCUMENTS. 

2938
01:37:54,835 --> 01:37:57,738
THEY ARE STILL BEING GONE 

2939
01:37:57,738 --> 01:37:58,605
THROUGH BY THE ARCHIVES. 

2940
01:37:58,605 --> 01:37:59,940
BECAUSE THIS IS BEING RUSHED 

2941
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:00,207
THROUGH. 

2942
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:02,443
WE DON'T GET A CHANCE TO SEE 

2943
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:02,643
THEM. 

2944
01:38:02,643 --> 01:38:04,445
THAT'S NOT FAIR TO US, AND 

2945
01:38:04,445 --> 01:38:07,448
FRANKLY, JUDGE, IT'S NOT FAIR 

2946
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:07,681
TO YOU. 

2947
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:13,254
YOU HAVE PROBABLY BEEN TOLD -- 

2948
01:38:13,254 --> 01:38:13,954
I CARE. 

2949
01:38:13,954 --> 01:38:16,957
I CARE ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF 

2950
01:38:16,957 --> 01:38:17,390
THE SUPREME COURT. 

2951
01:38:17,390 --> 01:38:19,092
I CARE ABOUT WHO IS ON THERE. 

2952
01:38:19,092 --> 01:38:21,028
I THINK YOU SHOULD CARE WHAT'S 

2953
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:25,366
IN THAT, JUST AS WE SHOULD CARE 

2954
01:38:25,366 --> 01:38:28,134
WHAT'S IN IT. 

2955
01:38:28,134 --> 01:38:30,237
MORE DOCUMENTS THAN I HAD TIME 

2956
01:38:30,237 --> 01:38:31,271
TO DISCUSS TODAY. 

2957
01:38:31,271 --> 01:38:34,842
I FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO 

2958
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:35,642
RECONCILE, REGULARLY BEING TOLD 

2959
01:38:35,642 --> 01:38:37,845
YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU 

2960
01:38:37,845 --> 01:38:40,647
RECEIVED NOTHING STOLEN HAD NO 

2961
01:38:40,647 --> 01:38:46,587
REASON TO SUSPECT ANYTHING WAS 

2962
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:51,325
STOLEN WHEN FRANKLY, AS WE NOW 

2963
01:38:51,325 --> 01:38:52,459
KNOW, REPUBLICAN STAFFER, 

2964
01:38:52,459 --> 01:38:52,959
MIRANDA, STOLE THINGS. 

2965
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:55,763
SOME OF THE THINGS HE STOLE 

2966
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:57,598
WENT DIRECTLY TO YOU. 

2967
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:04,037
LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER ONE. 

2968
01:39:04,037 --> 01:39:07,641
YOU TESTIFIED IN 2004 THAT THE 

2969
01:39:07,641 --> 01:39:09,543
PRACTICE OF BEING IN A COURT 

2970
01:39:09,543 --> 01:39:11,245
ARGUMENT, YOU DID NOT WORK WITH 

2971
01:39:11,245 --> 01:39:14,048
THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE WILLIAM 

2972
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,515
PRIOR. 

2973
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:18,618
HE WAS A CONTROVERSIAL NOMINEE. 

2974
01:39:18,618 --> 01:39:26,293
HE CALLED ROE V WADE THE 

2975
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:27,327
BIGGEST ABOMINATION. 

2976
01:39:27,327 --> 01:39:35,602
SAME SEX INTIMACY WOULD EXTEND 

2977
01:39:35,602 --> 01:39:36,837
TO PED BEASTOLOGY. 

2978
01:39:36,837 --> 01:39:39,039
YOU DIDN'T WORK ON HIS NO  

2979
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:39,773
NOMINATION PERSONALLY, BUT YOU 

2980
01:39:39,773 --> 01:39:43,210
DID WORK IN THE WORKING GROUP, 

2981
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:44,044
DID YOU NOT? 

2982
01:39:44,044 --> 01:39:48,515
>>  WE ALL WERE -- JUST SO YOU 

2983
01:39:48,515 --> 01:39:48,948
KNOW THE PROCESS. 

2984
01:39:48,948 --> 01:39:51,451
THE WHITE HOUSE, I THINK 

2985
01:39:51,451 --> 01:39:52,886
JUDICIAL SELECTION COMMITTEE. 

2986
01:39:52,886 --> 01:39:54,288
AND JUDGE GONZALEZ, THE COUNCIL 

2987
01:39:54,288 --> 01:39:57,691
TO THE PRESIDENT CHAIR OF THAT 

2988
01:39:57,691 --> 01:39:58,792
COMMITTEE. 

2989
01:39:58,792 --> 01:39:59,493
THAT STARTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER 

2990
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:01,395
PRESIDENT BUSH CAME INTO OFFICE 

2991
01:40:01,395 --> 01:40:01,662
IN 2001. 

2992
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:03,797
WE WOULD MEET WITH MEMOS AND 

2993
01:40:03,797 --> 01:40:05,666
INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE STAFF 

2994
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:06,133
WOULD BE ASSIGNED -- 

2995
01:40:06,133 --> 01:40:08,435
>>  DID YOU INTERVIEW WILLIAM 

2996
01:40:08,435 --> 01:40:08,669
PRIOR? 

2997
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:11,337
>>  I DON'T BELIEVE SO. 

2998
01:40:11,337 --> 01:40:14,041
IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT I DON'T 

2999
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:14,341
BELIEVE SO. 

3000
01:40:14,341 --> 01:40:16,276
IF I DID, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 

3001
01:40:16,276 --> 01:40:19,246
PART OF THE GENERAL PROCESS 

3002
01:40:19,246 --> 01:40:20,914
WHERE PEOPLE CAME IN. 

3003
01:40:20,914 --> 01:40:25,285
>>  I PUT IN THE RECORD, 

3004
01:40:25,285 --> 01:40:27,854
EXHIBIT C, YOU DID INTERVIEW 

3005
01:40:27,854 --> 01:40:28,055
HIM. 

3006
01:40:28,055 --> 01:40:29,656
>>  IT'S POSSIBLE. 

3007
01:40:29,656 --> 01:40:31,258
WE INTERVIEWED HUNDREDS OF 

3008
01:40:31,258 --> 01:40:34,094
NOMINEES, AS I SAID, SENATOR, 

3009
01:40:34,094 --> 01:40:35,796
AND WE MET EVERY WEEK FOR 

3010
01:40:35,796 --> 01:40:40,500
SEVERAL YEARS TO GO OVER 

3011
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:40,767
NOMINEES. 

3012
01:40:40,767 --> 01:40:42,703
WE WORKED CLOSE WITH THE 

3013
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:42,970
SNATORS. 

3014
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:43,871
I HAD VARIOUS STATES. 

3015
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:47,174
I HAD ILLINOIS, I HAD 

3016
01:40:47,174 --> 01:40:47,474
CALIFORNIA. 

3017
01:40:47,474 --> 01:40:51,879
I WORKED ON SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S 

3018
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:52,112
STAFF. 

3019
01:40:52,112 --> 01:40:54,548
BUT THEN WE WOULD SIT IN, 

3020
01:40:54,548 --> 01:40:55,449
SOMETIMES, ON INTERVIEWS OF 

3021
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:56,650
OTHER PEOPLE THAT WOULD COME IN 

3022
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:58,818
AND MEET AND GO OVER THE MEMOS. 

3023
01:40:58,818 --> 01:41:00,787
THEN WE WOULD MEET WITH THE 

3024
01:41:00,787 --> 01:41:01,087
PRESIDENT. 

3025
01:41:01,087 --> 01:41:02,990
WE MET EVERY WEEK WITH THE 

3026
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:04,124
PRESIDENT BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11. 

3027
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:05,392
AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, THOSE 

3028
01:41:05,392 --> 01:41:06,659
MEETINGS BECAME LESS FREQUENT. 

3029
01:41:06,659 --> 01:41:12,299
>>  YOU WOULD RECOMMEND HIM 

3030
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:15,302
INTERNALLY FOR THE 11th CIRCUIT 

3031
01:41:15,302 --> 01:41:15,735
SEAT, HAD YOU NOT? 

3032
01:41:15,735 --> 01:41:17,671
>>  I HAVE NO REASON THAT I 

3033
01:41:17,671 --> 01:41:18,572
WOULDN'T HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM, 

3034
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:20,073
BECAUSE HE WAS A HIGHLY 

3035
01:41:20,073 --> 01:41:22,376
QUALIFIED ATTORNEY GENERAL OF 

3036
01:41:22,376 --> 01:41:24,878
ALABAMA AND SENATOR SESSIONS, 

3037
01:41:24,878 --> 01:41:27,047
OF COURSE, KNEW HIM WELL AND HE 

3038
01:41:27,047 --> 01:41:27,514
WAS WELL RESPECTED. 

3039
01:41:27,514 --> 01:41:29,883
>>  THE ONLY REASON I ASK, ONE 

3040
01:41:29,883 --> 01:41:33,687
OF THE E-MAILS WE HAVE, IT SAYS 

3041
01:41:33,687 --> 01:41:35,289
BRETT, AT YOUR REQUEST, I ASK 

3042
01:41:35,289 --> 01:41:40,394
MATT TO SPEAK WITH PRIOR ABOUT 

3043
01:41:40,394 --> 01:41:41,160
HIS INTEREST. 

3044
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:48,902
I'M NOT ASKING THESE QUESTIONS 

3045
01:41:48,902 --> 01:41:53,073
TO -- TO GET YOU IN A BIND, 

3046
01:41:53,073 --> 01:41:53,373
JUDGE. 

3047
01:41:53,373 --> 01:41:55,476
I'M ASKING THEM BECAUSE IT IS 

3048
01:41:55,476 --> 01:41:58,579
SO EASY ON THESE HEARINGS TO 

3049
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:00,046
SAY, I DON'T REMEMBER. 

3050
01:42:00,046 --> 01:42:03,317
AND OFTENTIMES THAT'S THE CASE. 

3051
01:42:03,317 --> 01:42:06,586
BUT YOU MENTION MR. GONZALEZ. 

3052
01:42:06,586 --> 01:42:08,388
HE HAD DIFFICULTY REMEMBERING 

3053
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:11,024
WHEN HE CAME HERE. 

3054
01:42:11,024 --> 01:42:12,793
HE HAD ONE HEARING, SO HE 

3055
01:42:12,793 --> 01:42:15,561
WOULDN'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM. 

3056
01:42:15,561 --> 01:42:19,066
I GAVE HIM 35, 45 OF THE 

3057
01:42:19,066 --> 01:42:19,800
QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME. 

3058
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:22,803
EVERY ONE OF THEM HE SAID, I 

3059
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:23,303
DON'T REMEMBER. 

3060
01:42:23,303 --> 01:42:24,371
I DON'T RECALL. 

3061
01:42:24,371 --> 01:42:25,872
AND THEN EVERY QUESTION HAS 

3062
01:42:25,872 --> 01:42:27,374
ALMOST EVERY QUESTION ASKED BY 

3063
01:42:27,374 --> 01:42:29,176
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS SAY, 

3064
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:31,344
I DON'T RECALL. 

3065
01:42:31,344 --> 01:42:32,745
I DON'T REMEMBER. 

3066
01:42:32,745 --> 01:42:43,323
SHORTLY AFTER THAT, HE WENT TO 

3067
01:42:43,323 --> 01:42:44,024
PRIVATE PRACTICE.

3068
01:42:44,024 --> 01:42:54,334
I THINK IT IS SO DIFFICULT THAT 

3069
01:42:54,334 --> 01:42:56,904
YOU DON'T REMEMBER THE THINGS 

3070
01:42:56,904 --> 01:42:58,105
DONE BY SOMEBODY WHO, I THINK 

3071
01:42:58,105 --> 01:43:00,474
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, WE 

3072
01:43:00,474 --> 01:43:09,283
WOULD AGREE IS THE MOST 

3073
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:12,286
AGREGOUS, WHEN MIRANDA STOLE 

3074
01:43:12,286 --> 01:43:14,521
MATERIAL FROM HERE. 

3075
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:14,788
STOLE IT. 

3076
01:43:14,788 --> 01:43:18,157
TO SEND IT TO YOU AND OTHERS AT 

3077
01:43:18,157 --> 01:43:18,858
THE WHITE HOUSE. 

3078
01:43:18,858 --> 01:43:21,194
YOU HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF 

3079
01:43:21,194 --> 01:43:21,395
THAT? 

3080
01:43:21,395 --> 01:43:24,131
>>  I OBVIOUSLY RECALL THE E-

3081
01:43:24,131 --> 01:43:27,267
MAILS, OR HAVE SEEN THE E-

3082
01:43:27,267 --> 01:43:27,501
MAILS. 

3083
01:43:27,501 --> 01:43:29,036
YOUR LARGER QUESTION WAS, DID 

3084
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:35,209
THAT RAISE A RED FLAG AND I'VE 

3085
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:39,313
ANSWERED THAT, NO. 

3086
01:43:39,313 --> 01:43:50,724
>>  WELL -- WHEN YOU WERE IN 

3087
01:43:50,724 --> 01:43:52,225
THE WHITE HOUSE, WAS PART OF 

3088
01:43:52,225 --> 01:43:54,928
YOUR JOB TO COACH PRESIDENT 

3089
01:43:54,928 --> 01:43:59,032
BUSH'S JUDICIAL NOMINEES HOW TO 

3090
01:43:59,032 --> 01:44:02,336
ANSWER DEMOCRAT QUESTIONS ABOUT 

3091
01:44:02,336 --> 01:44:03,403
ROE VERSUS WADE? 

3092
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:08,175
>>  PART OF OUR JOB WOULD HAVE 

3093
01:44:08,175 --> 01:44:08,642
TO PREPARE NOMINEES. 

3094
01:44:08,642 --> 01:44:12,312
IT WAS COMMON FOR SENATORS TO 

3095
01:44:12,312 --> 01:44:15,748
ASK THAT QUESTION. 

3096
01:44:15,748 --> 01:44:17,484
SO, I ASSUME THAT WE WOULD HAVE 

3097
01:44:17,484 --> 01:44:20,554
BEEN INVOLVED IN GOING THROUGH 

3098
01:44:20,554 --> 01:44:20,921
MOCK SESSIONS. 

3099
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:22,255
I KNOW WE WERE INVOLVED IN 

3100
01:44:22,255 --> 01:44:24,090
GOING THROUGH MOCK SESSIONS. 

3101
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,892
WHICH IS VERY STANDARD. 

3102
01:44:25,892 --> 01:44:29,029
>>  YOU HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH 

3103
01:44:29,029 --> 01:44:31,231
MOCK SESSIONS WITH AT LEAST ONE 

3104
01:44:31,231 --> 01:44:34,167
REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM THIS 

3105
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:38,105
COMMITTEE AND OTHER REPUBLICAN 

3106
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:38,372
SENATORS. 

3107
01:44:38,372 --> 01:44:40,507
I'M NOT SAYING THAT AS A GOT 

3108
01:44:40,507 --> 01:44:40,807
YOU THING. 

3109
01:44:40,807 --> 01:44:44,711
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DO 

3110
01:44:44,711 --> 01:44:44,911
THAT. 

3111
01:44:44,911 --> 01:44:47,814
YOU DID ADVISE OWEN HOW SHE 

3112
01:44:47,814 --> 01:44:48,615
SHOULD RESPOND TO THAT, 

3113
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:50,517
ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE E-

3114
01:44:50,517 --> 01:44:50,751
MAILS. 

3115
01:44:50,751 --> 01:44:52,853
MY LAST QUESTION, DO YOU AGREE 

3116
01:44:52,853 --> 01:44:54,554
THAT A PLASTIC FIREARM CREATED 

3117
01:44:54,554 --> 01:45:00,861
WITH A 3D PRINTER, SO WE WOULD 

3118
01:45:00,861 --> 01:45:03,029
NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE MINDS OF 

3119
01:45:03,029 --> 01:45:05,932
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS IN THE  

3120
01:45:05,932 --> 01:45:07,334
18th CENTURY, WOULD YOU AGREE 

3121
01:45:07,334 --> 01:45:10,203
THAT COULD BE REGULATED OR 

3122
01:45:10,203 --> 01:45:12,272
BANNED WITHOUT CREATING ANY  

3123
01:45:12,272 --> 01:45:13,106
2nd AMENDMENT QUESTIONS? 

3124
01:45:13,106 --> 01:45:15,308
>>  I THINK THERE MIGHT BE 

3125
01:45:15,308 --> 01:45:19,312
LITIGATION COMING ON THAT, 

3126
01:45:19,312 --> 01:45:19,579
SENATOR. 

3127
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:20,514
CONSISTENT WITH JUDICIAL 

3128
01:45:20,514 --> 01:45:21,081
INDEPENDENCE, PRINCIPLES, I 

3129
01:45:21,081 --> 01:45:23,183
SHOULDN'T COMMENT ON A 

3130
01:45:23,183 --> 01:45:23,984
POTENTIAL CASE LIKE THAT. 

3131
01:45:23,984 --> 01:45:24,284
THANK YOU. 

3132
01:45:24,284 --> 01:45:26,553
>>  I HAVE WRITTEN OUT HERE 

3133
01:45:26,553 --> 01:45:29,155
YOUR ANSWER AHEAD OF TIME. 

3134
01:45:29,155 --> 01:45:31,725
AND I JUST WROTE IT SO YOU DID 

3135
01:45:31,725 --> 01:45:34,061
NOT SEE WHAT I WROTE. 

3136
01:45:34,061 --> 01:45:34,928
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. 

3137
01:45:34,928 --> 01:45:35,328
CHAIRMAN. 

3138
01:45:35,328 --> 01:45:39,266
>>  THANK YOU. 

3139
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:42,501
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

3140
01:45:42,501 --> 01:45:45,338
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO 

3141
01:45:45,338 --> 01:45:48,008
THE RECORD AN AD FROM THE L.A. 

3142
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:49,910
TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD, CAN THE 

3143
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:52,712
SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION EVER 

3144
01:45:52,712 --> 01:45:53,045
BE REPAIRED? 

3145
01:45:53,045 --> 01:45:56,716
THAT LETTER FROM KAVANAUGH'S 

3146
01:45:56,716 --> 01:45:57,217
CLASSMATES AT YALE. 

3147
01:45:57,217 --> 01:45:59,619
A LETTER SIGNED BY HUNDREDS OF 

3148
01:45:59,619 --> 01:46:01,588
FACULTY AND ALUMNI. 

3149
01:46:01,588 --> 01:46:05,792
A LETTER BY KENT, IN DECLARING 

3150
01:46:05,792 --> 01:46:07,160
LEDGER BY MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR. 

3151
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:13,166
SO, I ASK THAT BE ALLOWED. 

3152
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:17,304
JUST SAY WITHOUT OBJECTION. 

3153
01:46:17,304 --> 01:46:17,637
THAT'S GOOD. 

3154
01:46:17,637 --> 01:46:17,837
OKAY. 

3155
01:46:17,837 --> 01:46:18,238
THANK YOU JUDGE. 

3156
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:19,539
THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS I WANT 

3157
01:46:19,539 --> 01:46:20,941
TO GO OVER WITH YOU. 

3158
01:46:20,941 --> 01:46:24,310
ONE, I WANT TO COMPLIMENT 

3159
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:29,015
SENATOR LEAHY, HE WORKED WITH 

3160
01:46:29,015 --> 01:46:31,218
SENATOR GRASSLEY TO GET WHAT 

3161
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:33,653
HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY COMMITTEE 

3162
01:46:33,653 --> 01:46:34,554
CONFIDENTIAL RELEASE TO THE 

3163
01:46:34,554 --> 01:46:34,787
PUBLIC. 

3164
01:46:34,787 --> 01:46:37,157
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS AROUND 

3165
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:37,390
HERE. 

3166
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:38,859
YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU 

3167
01:46:38,859 --> 01:46:40,494
WANT, BUT YOU TRY TO WORK WITH 

3168
01:46:40,494 --> 01:46:43,330
YOUR COLLEAGUES AND MANY TIMES, 

3169
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:43,929
YOU CAN SUCCEED. 

3170
01:46:43,929 --> 01:46:45,866
FROM A PUBLIC'S POINT OF VIEW, 

3171
01:46:45,866 --> 01:46:47,968
IT HAS TO WORK THIS WAY. 

3172
01:46:47,968 --> 01:46:50,937
YOU JUST CAN'T DO EVERYTHING 

3173
01:46:50,937 --> 01:46:53,740
YOU WANT IN A LEGISLATIVE BODY. 

3174
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:55,742
THERE ARE RULES AND IT'S 

3175
01:46:55,742 --> 01:46:58,144
FRUSTRATING TO BE TOLD NO ON 

3176
01:46:58,144 --> 01:47:00,347
SOMETHING YOU ARE PASSIONATE 

3177
01:47:00,347 --> 01:47:01,248
ABOUT. 

3178
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:04,851
BUT I'M OFTEN ASKED, PEOPLE 

3179
01:47:04,851 --> 01:47:07,053
WONDER, ARE THESE HEARINGS 

3180
01:47:07,053 --> 01:47:07,787
TURNING INTO A CIRCUS? 

3181
01:47:07,787 --> 01:47:13,025
AND I WANT TO DEFEND CIRCUSES. 

3182
01:47:13,025 --> 01:47:13,860
CIRCUSES ARE ENTERTAINING AND 

3183
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:17,430
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CHILDREN TO 

3184
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:17,630
THEM. 

3185
01:47:17,630 --> 01:47:19,466
THIS HEARING IS NEITHER 

3186
01:47:19,466 --> 01:47:23,303
ENTERTAINING NOR APPROPRIATE 

3187
01:47:23,303 --> 01:47:24,470
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. 

3188
01:47:24,470 --> 01:47:27,240
NOW, SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES I 

3189
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:29,042
RESPECT GREATLY ARE TRYING TO 

3190
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:29,575
MAKE A POINT. 

3191
01:47:29,575 --> 01:47:31,745
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT POINT 

3192
01:47:31,745 --> 01:47:31,945
IS. 

3193
01:47:31,945 --> 01:47:33,246
BUT I DO KNOW THIS. 

3194
01:47:33,246 --> 01:47:37,350
IF YOU WANT TO BE PRESIDENT, 

3195
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:40,787
WHICH I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT, IS 

3196
01:47:40,787 --> 01:47:40,987
HARD. 

3197
01:47:40,987 --> 01:47:44,791
AND WHAT YOU DO WILL BE THE 

3198
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:49,195
EXAMPLE OTHERS WILL FOLLOW. 

3199
01:47:49,195 --> 01:47:51,898
BACK TO THE SUBJECT MATTER. 

3200
01:47:51,898 --> 01:47:52,766
THE MORRISON CASE. 

3201
01:47:52,766 --> 01:47:55,235
WAS THAT ABOUT SEPARATION OF 

3202
01:47:55,235 --> 01:47:55,468
POWERS? 

3203
01:47:55,468 --> 01:47:57,570
>>  THAT WAS THE SEPARATION OF 

3204
01:47:57,570 --> 01:47:57,904
POWERS CASE. 

3205
01:47:57,904 --> 01:47:58,939
>>  OKAY. 

3206
01:47:58,939 --> 01:48:03,476
IT WAS ABOUT A CONGRESSIONAL 

3207
01:48:03,476 --> 01:48:05,946
STATUTE AND THE AUTHORITY OF 

3208
01:48:05,946 --> 01:48:07,747
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND HOW 

3209
01:48:07,747 --> 01:48:08,147
THEY INTERACTED. 

3210
01:48:08,147 --> 01:48:08,547
IS THAT CORRECT? 

3211
01:48:08,547 --> 01:48:09,815
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 

3212
01:48:09,815 --> 01:48:12,185
AND A VERY SPECIFIC STATUTORY 

3213
01:48:12,185 --> 01:48:14,521
SCHEME THAT WAS UNPRECEDENTED 

3214
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:16,556
HAD THE JUDICIARY INVOLVED IN 

3215
01:48:16,556 --> 01:48:19,326
APPOINTING THE COUNCIL. 

3216
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:23,096
>>  APPARENTLY, KAGAN AND 

3217
01:48:23,096 --> 01:48:24,998
SCALIA AGREED, BUT KAGAN AGREED 

3218
01:48:24,998 --> 01:48:25,465
WITH SCALIA'S DECENT. 

3219
01:48:25,465 --> 01:48:27,200
>>  SHE CALLED IT THE GREATEST 

3220
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:29,002
EVER WRITTEN, AND SHE ADDED, IT 

3221
01:48:29,002 --> 01:48:29,703
GETS BETTER EVERY YEAR. 

3222
01:48:29,703 --> 01:48:31,771
>>  I DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE 

3223
01:48:31,771 --> 01:48:33,840
HABIT OF LISTENING TO KAGAN, 

3224
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:34,774
BUT I WILL HERE. 

3225
01:48:34,774 --> 01:48:37,243
BECAUSE SHE'S A FINE PERSON. 

3226
01:48:37,243 --> 01:48:40,613
THE SITUATION WE HAVE BEFORE US 

3227
01:48:40,613 --> 01:48:42,649
ABOUT MR. MUELLER, THAT'S NOT A 

3228
01:48:42,649 --> 01:48:44,951
SEPARATION OF POWERS ISSUE, IS 

3229
01:48:44,951 --> 01:48:45,785
IT? 

3230
01:48:45,785 --> 01:48:46,686
AREN'T THESE DIFFERENT FACTS 

3231
01:48:46,686 --> 01:48:48,388
THAT MR. MUELLER WAS APPOINTED 

3232
01:48:48,388 --> 01:48:50,190
THROUGH DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 

3233
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:50,590
REGULATIONS. 

3234
01:48:50,590 --> 01:48:52,993
>>  SENATOR, I DON'T WANT TO 

3235
01:48:52,993 --> 01:48:54,394
TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CURRENT 

3236
01:48:54,394 --> 01:48:56,296
EVENTS, BUT I WILL REFER BACK 

3237
01:48:56,296 --> 01:48:59,232
TO WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN 

3238
01:48:59,232 --> 01:49:04,270
PREVIOUSLY ABOUT SPECIAL 

3239
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:04,537
COUNSEL. 

3240
01:49:04,537 --> 01:49:07,774
DO YOU WATCH TELEVISION? 

3241
01:49:07,774 --> 01:49:08,642
THE COUNSEL DOESN'T EXIST 

3242
01:49:08,642 --> 01:49:09,042
ANYMORE, DOES IT? 

3243
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:12,779
>>  THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL 

3244
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:15,148
STATUTE DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE 

3245
01:49:15,148 --> 01:49:17,250
SINCE 1999, THE TRADITIONAL 

3246
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:19,018
SPECIAL COUNSEL SYSTEM I HAVE 

3247
01:49:19,018 --> 01:49:20,654
WRITTEN ABOUT IS THE ORDINARY 

3248
01:49:20,654 --> 01:49:21,054
WAY THAT OUTSIDE 

3249
01:49:21,054 --> 01:49:21,421
INVESTIGATIONS. 

3250
01:49:21,421 --> 01:49:24,190
>>  IS THAT AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH 

3251
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:24,456
FUNCTION? 

3252
01:49:24,456 --> 01:49:25,091
>>  THAT IS ORDINARILY 

3253
01:49:25,091 --> 01:49:27,693
APPOINTED BY THE ATTORNEY 

3254
01:49:27,693 --> 01:49:27,993
GENERAL -- 

3255
01:49:27,993 --> 01:49:29,261
>>  WHO IS A MEMBER OF WHAT? 

3256
01:49:29,261 --> 01:49:30,797
>>  THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 

3257
01:49:30,797 --> 01:49:32,331
>>  LAST TIME I CHECKED, THAT'S 

3258
01:49:32,331 --> 01:49:33,633
NOT A SEPARATION OF POWERS 

3259
01:49:33,633 --> 01:49:34,200
ISSUE. 

3260
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:37,270
>>  THAT TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN 

3261
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:37,737
AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 

3262
01:49:37,737 --> 01:49:42,375
>> NOW THE QUESTION IS, IF 

3263
01:49:42,375 --> 01:49:44,978
SOMEONE IS APPOINTED AS SPECIAL 

3264
01:49:44,978 --> 01:49:47,681
COUNSEL BY THE DEPARTMENT OF 

3265
01:49:47,681 --> 01:49:49,182
JUSTICE REGULATIONS WHO HAS 

3266
01:49:49,182 --> 01:49:50,183
AUTHORITY OVER IMPLEMENTING 

3267
01:49:50,183 --> 01:49:52,719
THOSE REGULATIONS AND 

3268
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:53,353
OVERSEEING THOSE REGULATIONS. 

3269
01:49:53,353 --> 01:49:58,491
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IS 

3270
01:49:58,491 --> 01:49:58,791
DIFFERENT. 

3271
01:49:58,791 --> 01:49:59,826
LEGALLY AND FACTUALLY, THAN THE 

3272
01:49:59,826 --> 01:50:02,128
MORRISON SITUATION, WHERE YOU 

3273
01:50:02,128 --> 01:50:02,661
HAD A STATUTE. 

3274
01:50:02,661 --> 01:50:04,230
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 

3275
01:50:04,230 --> 01:50:08,001
THE LAW REGARDING THE 

3276
01:50:08,001 --> 01:50:08,301
PRESIDENT. 

3277
01:50:08,301 --> 01:50:09,703
CLINTON TELLS US, SEE IF I'M 

3278
01:50:09,703 --> 01:50:09,970
CORRECT. 

3279
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:12,272
THAT YOU CAN BE PRESIDENT OF 

3280
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:12,705
THE UNITED STATES. 

3281
01:50:12,705 --> 01:50:15,775
YOU CAN STILL BE SUED FOR 

3282
01:50:15,775 --> 01:50:18,478
CONDUCT BEFORE YOU'RE A 

3283
01:50:18,478 --> 01:50:18,778
PRESIDENT. 

3284
01:50:18,778 --> 01:50:19,980
WHEN YOU INVOKE EXECUTIVE 

3285
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:21,281
PRIVILEGE, THE COURT SAID NO, 

3286
01:50:21,281 --> 01:50:22,582
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU HAVE TO SHOW 

3287
01:50:22,582 --> 01:50:25,085
UP AT A DEPOSITION, BECAUSE IT 

3288
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:26,919
HAPPENED BEFORE YOU WERE 

3289
01:50:26,919 --> 01:50:27,219
PRESIDENT. 

3290
01:50:27,219 --> 01:50:27,620
IS THAT CORRECT? 

3291
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:31,024
>>  A CIVIL SUIT, THE CLINTON 

3292
01:50:31,024 --> 01:50:33,026
VERSUS JONES CASE, A SUIT THAT 

3293
01:50:33,026 --> 01:50:34,995
HAD INVOLVED ACTIVITY BEFORE 

3294
01:50:34,995 --> 01:50:35,929
PRESIDENT CLINTON BECAME 

3295
01:50:35,929 --> 01:50:36,229
PRESIDENT. 

3296
01:50:36,229 --> 01:50:38,598
>>  SO, IT'S PRETTY WELL 

3297
01:50:38,598 --> 01:50:39,332
UNDERSTOOD THROUGH SUPREME 

3298
01:50:39,332 --> 01:50:41,201
COURT PRECEDENT THAT IF YOU'RE 

3299
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:42,502
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

3300
01:50:42,502 --> 01:50:43,770
STATES, AND YOU ENGAGED IN 

3301
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:45,371
CONDUCT THAT ALLOWED YOU TO BE 

3302
01:50:45,371 --> 01:50:47,774
SUED BEFORE YOU GOT TO BE 

3303
01:50:47,774 --> 01:50:49,375
PRESIDENT, YOU CAN'T AVOID YOUR 

3304
01:50:49,375 --> 01:50:52,779
DAY IN COURT ON THE CIVIL SIDE. 

3305
01:50:52,779 --> 01:50:54,414
THE NIXON HOLDING SAID WHAT? 

3306
01:50:54,414 --> 01:50:56,282
>>  THE NIXON HOLDING SAID IN 

3307
01:50:56,282 --> 01:51:00,120
THE CONTEXT OF THE SPECIFIC 

3308
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:01,387
REGULATIONS THERE, THAT A 

3309
01:51:01,387 --> 01:51:03,423
CRIMINAL TRIAL SUBPOENA TO THE 

3310
01:51:03,423 --> 01:51:04,524
PRESIDENT FOR INFORMATION, IN 

3311
01:51:04,524 --> 01:51:08,728
THAT CASE, THE TAPES, COULD BE 

3312
01:51:08,728 --> 01:51:08,995
ENFORCED. 

3313
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:10,196
NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXECUTIVE 

3314
01:51:10,196 --> 01:51:11,197
PRIVILEGE THAT WAS RECOGNIZED 

3315
01:51:11,197 --> 01:51:13,299
IN THAT CASE AS ROOTED IN 

3316
01:51:13,299 --> 01:51:14,433
ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONSTITUTION. 

3317
01:51:14,433 --> 01:51:16,102
>>  SO, THAT'S THE LAW OF THE 

3318
01:51:16,102 --> 01:51:17,503
LAND AS OF THIS MOMENT. 

3319
01:51:17,503 --> 01:51:19,005
>>  THAT UNITED STATES VERSUS 

3320
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:20,006
NIXON IS THE LAW OF THE LAND. 

3321
01:51:20,006 --> 01:51:23,176
>>  NOW, WHETHER OR NOT A 

3322
01:51:23,176 --> 01:51:24,377
PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED WHILE 

3323
01:51:24,377 --> 01:51:26,479
IN OFFICE HAS BEEN A DISCUSSION 

3324
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:28,381
THAT HAS GONE ON FOR A LONG 

3325
01:51:28,381 --> 01:51:28,681
TIME. 

3326
01:51:28,681 --> 01:51:30,516
IS THAT TRUE IN THE LEGAL 

3327
01:51:30,516 --> 01:51:30,749
WORLD? 

3328
01:51:30,749 --> 01:51:31,985
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 

3329
01:51:31,985 --> 01:51:33,520
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR 

3330
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,321
THE LAST 45 YEARS, HAS TAKEN 

3331
01:51:35,321 --> 01:51:37,290
THE CONSISTENT POSITION THROUGH 

3332
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:37,924
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC 

3333
01:51:37,924 --> 01:51:39,025
ADMINISTRATIONS THAT A SITTING 

3334
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:42,729
PRESIDENT MAY NOT BE INDICTED 

3335
01:51:42,729 --> 01:51:43,029
IN OFFICE. 

3336
01:51:43,029 --> 01:51:44,430
THE MOST THOROUGH OPINION IS 

3337
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:46,432
WRITTEN BY RANDY MOSS, WHO WAS 

3338
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:49,102
HEAD OF PRESIDENT CLINTON'S 

3339
01:51:49,102 --> 01:51:51,737
OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL IN 

3340
01:51:51,737 --> 01:51:52,472
2000. 

3341
01:51:52,472 --> 01:51:53,907
HE IS NOW A DISTRICT JUDGE 

3342
01:51:53,907 --> 01:51:55,575
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA ON 

3343
01:51:55,575 --> 01:51:57,177
THE DISTRICT COURT IN D.C. 

3344
01:51:57,177 --> 01:51:59,813
>>  I ANY YOU HAVE WRITTEN ON 

3345
01:51:59,813 --> 01:52:00,113
THIS TOPIC. 

3346
01:52:00,113 --> 01:52:01,915
>>  I HAVE NOT WRITTEN ON THE 

3347
01:52:01,915 --> 01:52:02,348
CONSTITUTIONALITY. 

3348
01:52:02,348 --> 01:52:03,516
>>  WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE 

3349
01:52:03,516 --> 01:52:04,083
WISE TO DO THIS. 

3350
01:52:04,083 --> 01:52:07,220
>>  I MADE MY THOUGHTS KNOWN 

3351
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,421
FOR CONGRESS TO EXAMINE, 

3352
01:52:08,421 --> 01:52:10,056
BECAUSE IN THE WAKE OF 

3353
01:52:10,056 --> 01:52:11,825
SEPTEMBER 11, I THOUGHT ONE OF 

3354
01:52:11,825 --> 01:52:13,326
THE THINGS CONGRESS COULD LOOK 

3355
01:52:13,326 --> 01:52:15,795
AT IS HOW TO MAKE THE 

3356
01:52:15,795 --> 01:52:16,730
PRESIDENCY MORE EFFECTIVE. 

3357
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:19,933
>>  I JUST WANT MY DEMOCRATIC 

3358
01:52:19,933 --> 01:52:22,035
COLLEAGUES TO REMIND YOU THAT 

3359
01:52:22,035 --> 01:52:23,703
WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS 

3360
01:52:23,703 --> 01:52:25,371
BEING INVESTIGATED, YOU TOOK 

3361
01:52:25,371 --> 01:52:27,407
THE POSITION THAT HE IS NOT 

3362
01:52:27,407 --> 01:52:29,776
ABOVE THE LAW, BUT IN TERMS OF 

3363
01:52:29,776 --> 01:52:30,677
INDICTING A SITTING PRESIDENT, 

3364
01:52:30,677 --> 01:52:32,312
IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE 

3365
01:52:32,312 --> 01:52:34,280
COUNTRY TO WAIT AND THE PERSON 

3366
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:37,317
WHO ECHOED THAT THE MOST, OR AT 

3367
01:52:37,317 --> 01:52:38,785
LEAST EFFECTIVE FROM HIS POINT 

3368
01:52:38,785 --> 01:52:40,553
OF VIEW WAS JOE BIDEN. 

3369
01:52:40,553 --> 01:52:43,723
SO THERE'S NOTHING NEW HERE, 

3370
01:52:43,723 --> 01:52:43,956
FOLKS. 

3371
01:52:43,956 --> 01:52:45,158
WHEN IT'S A DEMOCRATIC 

3372
01:52:45,158 --> 01:52:47,227
PRESIDENT, THEY ADOPT THE 

3373
01:52:47,227 --> 01:52:48,962
POSITIONS THAT THEY ARE ARGUING 

3374
01:52:48,962 --> 01:52:49,295
AGAINST NOW. 

3375
01:52:49,295 --> 01:52:50,396
THAT'S NOTHING NEW IN POLITICS. 

3376
01:52:50,396 --> 01:52:54,367
I'M SURE WE DO THE SAME THING. 

3377
01:52:54,367 --> 01:52:57,170
SO, THIS MAN, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 

3378
01:52:57,170 --> 01:52:59,339
IS NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG BY 

3379
01:52:59,339 --> 01:53:00,707
TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE THE 

3380
01:53:00,707 --> 01:53:02,174
WAY HE TALKS ABOUT IT. 

3381
01:53:02,174 --> 01:53:05,111
WHAT WE'RE DOING WRONG IS 

3382
01:53:05,111 --> 01:53:05,544
BLENDING CONCEPTS. 

3383
01:53:05,544 --> 01:53:08,214
TO JUSTIFY A VOTE THAT WILL BE 

3384
01:53:08,214 --> 01:53:08,514
INEVITABLE. 

3385
01:53:08,514 --> 01:53:10,016
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY THESE 

3386
01:53:10,016 --> 01:53:11,684
GAMES TO VOTE NO. 

3387
01:53:11,684 --> 01:53:14,454
JUST SAY YOU DON'T AGREE WITH 

3388
01:53:14,454 --> 01:53:15,221
HIS PHILOSOPHY. 

3389
01:53:15,221 --> 01:53:16,656
YOU DON'T THINK HE'S QUALIFIED, 

3390
01:53:16,656 --> 01:53:18,758
BUT THE THING I HATE THE MOST 

3391
01:53:18,758 --> 01:53:22,061
IS TO TAKE CONCEPTS AND TURN 

3392
01:53:22,061 --> 01:53:23,663
THEM AROUND, UPSIDE DOWN, TO 

3393
01:53:23,663 --> 01:53:24,664
MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THERE IS 

3394
01:53:24,664 --> 01:53:26,366
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU. 

3395
01:53:26,366 --> 01:53:28,134
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU. 

3396
01:53:28,134 --> 01:53:31,604
THE FAULT LIES ON OUR SIDE. 

3397
01:53:31,604 --> 01:53:35,308
MOST AMERICANS AFTER THIS 

3398
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:39,179
HEARING WILL HAVE A DIMMER VIEW 

3399
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:41,647
OF THE SENATE. 

3400
01:53:41,647 --> 01:53:41,947
RIGHTLY SO. 

3401
01:53:41,947 --> 01:53:44,317
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO BELIEVE 

3402
01:53:44,317 --> 01:53:45,518
THAT YOU STOLE ANYTHING. 

3403
01:53:45,518 --> 01:53:46,953
DID YOU STEAL ANYTHING FROM 

3404
01:53:46,953 --> 01:53:48,087
ANYBODY WHILE YOU WERE WORKING 

3405
01:53:48,087 --> 01:53:49,422
AT THE WHITE HOUSE? 

3406
01:53:49,422 --> 01:53:50,156
>>  NO. 

3407
01:53:50,156 --> 01:53:53,159
>>  DID YOU KNOW THAT ANYBODY 

3408
01:53:53,159 --> 01:53:54,561
STOLE ANYTHING OR DID YOU 

3409
01:53:54,561 --> 01:53:55,728
ENCOURAGE THEM TO STEAL 

3410
01:53:55,728 --> 01:53:55,994
ANYTHING? 

3411
01:53:55,994 --> 01:53:56,228
>>  NO. 

3412
01:53:56,228 --> 01:53:58,430
>>  DID YOU USE ANYTHING 

3413
01:53:58,430 --> 01:53:59,398
KNOWINGLY THAT WAS STOLEN? 

3414
01:53:59,398 --> 01:54:00,166
>>  NO. 

3415
01:54:00,166 --> 01:54:05,438
>>  SO, YOU CAN TALK ABOUT MR. 

3416
01:54:05,438 --> 01:54:06,739
MIRANDA, BUT I DON'T WANT THE 

3417
01:54:06,739 --> 01:54:08,441
PUBLIC TO BELIEVE THAT YOU DID 

3418
01:54:08,441 --> 01:54:11,110
ANYTHING WRONG, BECAUSE I DON'T 

3419
01:54:11,110 --> 01:54:11,510
BELIEVE YOU DID. 

3420
01:54:11,510 --> 01:54:13,812
SO, IT'S OKAY TO VOTE NO. 

3421
01:54:13,812 --> 01:54:16,916
BUT IT'S NOT OKAY TO TAKE LEGAL 

3422
01:54:16,916 --> 01:54:19,252
CONCEPTS AND FLIP THEM UPSIDE 

3423
01:54:19,252 --> 01:54:21,154
DOWN AND ACT LIKE WE'RE DOING 

3424
01:54:21,154 --> 01:54:21,854
SOMETHING WRONG ON THE 

3425
01:54:21,854 --> 01:54:23,556
REPUBLICAN SIDE WHEN YOU HAD 

3426
01:54:23,556 --> 01:54:26,793
THE EXACT SAME POSITION WHEN IT 

3427
01:54:26,793 --> 01:54:29,162
WAS YOUR TURN. 

3428
01:54:29,162 --> 01:54:30,663
ROE V WADE, YOU'VE HEARD OF 

3429
01:54:30,663 --> 01:54:31,231
THAT CASE, RIGHT? 

3430
01:54:31,231 --> 01:54:33,366
>>  I HAVE, SENATOR. 

3431
01:54:33,366 --> 01:54:35,969
>>  NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE 

3432
01:54:35,969 --> 01:54:37,270
IT. 

3433
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:39,605
A  LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T. 

3434
01:54:39,605 --> 01:54:42,909
IT'S AN EMOTIONAL DEBATE IN THE 

3435
01:54:42,909 --> 01:54:43,176
COUNTRY. 

3436
01:54:43,176 --> 01:54:45,445
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE 

3437
01:54:45,445 --> 01:54:47,513
CONSTITUTION ABOUT A RIGHT TO 

3438
01:54:47,513 --> 01:54:47,780
ABORTION? 

3439
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:49,214
IS ANYTHING WRITTEN IN THE 

3440
01:54:49,214 --> 01:54:49,481
DOCUMENT? 

3441
01:54:49,481 --> 01:54:52,151
>>  SENATOR, THE SUPREME COURT 

3442
01:54:52,151 --> 01:54:55,588
IS RECOGNIZED THE RIGHT TO 

3443
01:54:55,588 --> 01:54:58,191
ABORTION SINCE THE 1973 ROE V 

3444
01:54:58,191 --> 01:54:58,491
WADE CASE. 

3445
01:54:58,491 --> 01:55:00,393
REAFFIRMED IT MANY TIMES. 

3446
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:01,494
>>  MY QUESTION IS, DID THEY 

3447
01:55:01,494 --> 01:55:02,462
FIND A PHRASE IN THE 

3448
01:55:02,462 --> 01:55:04,163
CONSTITUTION THAT SAID THAT THE 

3449
01:55:04,163 --> 01:55:06,265
STATE CANNOT INTERFERE WITH A 

3450
01:55:06,265 --> 01:55:08,434
WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE UNTIL 

3451
01:55:08,434 --> 01:55:09,602
MEDICAL VIABILITY OCCURS? 

3452
01:55:09,602 --> 01:55:10,570
IS THAT IN THE CONSTITUTION? 

3453
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:12,771
>>  THE SUPREME COURT APPLYING 

3454
01:55:12,771 --> 01:55:13,105
THE LIBERTY. 

3455
01:55:13,105 --> 01:55:14,974
>>  IT'S A SIMPLE. 

3456
01:55:14,974 --> 01:55:17,377
NO, IT'S NOT, SENATOR GRAHAM. 

3457
01:55:17,377 --> 01:55:17,710
THOSE WORDS. 

3458
01:55:17,710 --> 01:55:20,847
>>  I WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL, 

3459
01:55:20,847 --> 01:55:22,381
BECAUSE THIS IS A TOPIC ON 

3460
01:55:22,381 --> 01:55:22,648
WHICH -- 

3461
01:55:22,648 --> 01:55:25,351
>>  IF YOU'LL JUST FOLLOW ME, 

3462
01:55:25,351 --> 01:55:26,386
I'LL LET YOU TALK. 

3463
01:55:26,386 --> 01:55:28,955
THE POINT IS, WILL YOU TELL ME 

3464
01:55:28,955 --> 01:55:31,257
YES OR NO, IS THERE ANYTHING IN 

3465
01:55:31,257 --> 01:55:32,892
THE DOCUMENT ITSELF TALKING 

3466
01:55:32,892 --> 01:55:34,560
ABOUT LIMITING THE STATE'S 

3467
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:38,665
ABILITY TO PROTECT THE UNBORN 

3468
01:55:38,665 --> 01:55:39,065
BEFORE VIABILITY? 

3469
01:55:39,065 --> 01:55:42,468
IS THERE ANY PHRASE IN THE 

3470
01:55:42,468 --> 01:55:43,068
CONSTITUTION ABOUT ABORTION? 

3471
01:55:43,068 --> 01:55:44,737
>>  THE SUPREME COURT HAS 

3472
01:55:44,737 --> 01:55:45,938
FOUNDED UNDER THE LIBERTY 

3473
01:55:45,938 --> 01:55:47,407
CLAUSE, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT -- 

3474
01:55:47,407 --> 01:55:49,242
>>  IS THERE ANYTHING TALKING 

3475
01:55:49,242 --> 01:55:49,609
ABOUT ABORTION? 

3476
01:55:49,609 --> 01:55:53,078
>>  THE LIBERTY CLAUSE REFERS 

3477
01:55:53,078 --> 01:55:53,412
TO LIBERTY. 

3478
01:55:53,412 --> 01:55:56,949
>>  LAST TIME I CHECKED, 

3479
01:55:56,949 --> 01:55:57,850
LIBERTY DIDN'T EQUATE TO 

3480
01:55:57,850 --> 01:55:58,117
ABORTION. 

3481
01:55:58,117 --> 01:56:00,553
THE SUPREME COURT SAID IT DID, 

3482
01:56:00,553 --> 01:56:01,186
BUT HERE'S THE POINT. 

3483
01:56:01,186 --> 01:56:05,758
WHAT ARE THE LIMITS ON THIS 

3484
01:56:05,758 --> 01:56:06,392
CONCEPT? 

3485
01:56:06,392 --> 01:56:08,928
YOU HAD FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, 

3486
01:56:08,928 --> 01:56:09,929
EIGHT, OR NINE JUDGES. 

3487
01:56:09,929 --> 01:56:12,265
WHAT ARE THE LIMITS ON THE 

3488
01:56:12,265 --> 01:56:17,270
ABILITY OF THE COURT TO FIND 

3489
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:18,838
RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO A 

3490
01:56:18,838 --> 01:56:19,305
PARTICULAR SITUATION. 

3491
01:56:19,305 --> 01:56:20,940
WHAT ARE THE CHECKS AND 

3492
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:22,742
BALANCES OF PEOPLE IN YOUR 

3493
01:56:22,742 --> 01:56:24,343
BUSINESS, IF YOU CAN FIND FIVE 

3494
01:56:24,343 --> 01:56:28,548
PEOPLE WHO AGREE WITH YOU, TO 

3495
01:56:28,548 --> 01:56:29,749
CONFER A RIGHT WHETHER THE 

3496
01:56:29,749 --> 01:56:31,751
PUBLIC LIKES IT OR NOT, BASED 

3497
01:56:31,751 --> 01:56:34,387
ON THIS CONCEPT OF RIGHTS. 

3498
01:56:34,387 --> 01:56:36,255
WHAT ARE THE OUTER LIMITS TO 

3499
01:56:36,255 --> 01:56:37,190
THIS? 

3500
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:43,396
>>  THE SUPREME COURT IN THE 

3501
01:56:43,396 --> 01:56:44,597
GLUCKSBERG CASE, IS THE TEST 

3502
01:56:44,597 --> 01:56:47,767
THAT THE SUPREME COURT USES TO 

3503
01:56:47,767 --> 01:56:48,801
FIND RIGHTS UNDER THE LIBERTY 

3504
01:56:48,801 --> 01:56:50,269
CLAUSE OF THE DUE PROCESS 

3505
01:56:50,269 --> 01:56:51,737
CLAUSE OF THE 14th AMENDMENT:  

3506
01:56:51,737 --> 01:56:53,239
AND THAT REFERS TO RIGHTS 

3507
01:56:53,239 --> 01:56:55,675
ROOTED IN THE HISTORY AND 

3508
01:56:55,675 --> 01:56:58,076
TRADITION OF THE COUNTRY, SO AS 

3509
01:56:58,076 --> 01:56:58,443
TO PREVENT -- 

3510
01:56:58,443 --> 01:57:00,847
>>  LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 

3511
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:02,348
IS THERE ANY RIGHT ROOTED IN 

3512
01:57:02,348 --> 01:57:04,650
THE HISTORY AND TRADITIONS OF 

3513
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:07,887
THE COUNTRY WHERE LEGISLATIVE 

3514
01:57:07,887 --> 01:57:10,189
BODIES COULD NOT INTERCEDE ON 

3515
01:57:10,189 --> 01:57:11,991
BEHALF OF THE UNBORN BEFORE 

3516
01:57:11,991 --> 01:57:12,592
MEDICAL VIABILITY. 

3517
01:57:12,592 --> 01:57:13,859
IS THAT PART OF OUR HISTORY? 

3518
01:57:13,859 --> 01:57:16,496
>>  THE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT 

3519
01:57:16,496 --> 01:57:18,097
HAS RECOGNIZED THE RIGHT TO 

3520
01:57:18,097 --> 01:57:18,364
ABORTION. 

3521
01:57:18,364 --> 01:57:21,300
>>  I'M JUST SAYING, WHAT PART 

3522
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:23,503
OF THE HISTORY -- I DON'T THINK 

3523
01:57:23,503 --> 01:57:25,371
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS, PEOPLE 

3524
01:57:25,371 --> 01:57:26,038
MENTIONED OUR FOUNDING FATHERS. 

3525
01:57:26,038 --> 01:57:30,042
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT BEING 

3526
01:57:30,042 --> 01:57:31,009
PART OF AMERICAN HISTORY. 

3527
01:57:31,009 --> 01:57:33,513
SO, HOW DID THE COURT DETERMINE 

3528
01:57:33,513 --> 01:57:34,247
THAT IT WAS? 

3529
01:57:34,247 --> 01:57:37,650
>>  THE COURT IMPLIED THE 

3530
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:39,085
PRECEDENT THAT EXISTED AND 

3531
01:57:39,085 --> 01:57:40,652
FOUND IN 1973, THAT UNDER THE 

3532
01:57:40,652 --> 01:57:41,019
LIBERTY CLAUSE. 

3533
01:57:41,019 --> 01:57:43,189
>>  BEFORE 1973, I MEAN, WHEN 

3534
01:57:43,189 --> 01:57:46,692
YOU TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF 

3535
01:57:46,692 --> 01:57:47,793
THE UNITED STATES, THE COURT 

3536
01:57:47,793 --> 01:57:50,696
HAS FOUND THAT PART OF OUR 

3537
01:57:50,696 --> 01:57:52,898
HISTORY IS FOR THE LEGISLATIVE 

3538
01:57:52,898 --> 01:57:57,937
BODIES, NOT TO HAVE A SAY ABOUT 

3539
01:57:57,937 --> 01:58:00,873
PROTECTING THE UNBORN UNTIL 

3540
01:58:00,873 --> 01:58:01,306
MEDICAL VIABILITY. 

3541
01:58:01,306 --> 01:58:02,675
I HAVEN'T -- WHETHER YOU AGREE 

3542
01:58:02,675 --> 01:58:04,744
WITH THAT OR NOT, I DON'T THINK 

3543
01:58:04,744 --> 01:58:06,511
THAT'S PART OF OUR HISTORY. 

3544
01:58:06,511 --> 01:58:07,980
SO, FILL IN THE BLANK. 

3545
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:10,383
WHAT ARE THE LIMITS OF PEOPLE 

3546
01:58:10,383 --> 01:58:12,885
IN YOUR BUSINESS APPLYING THAT 

3547
01:58:12,885 --> 01:58:14,720
CONCEPT TO ALMOST ANYTHING THAT 

3548
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,588
YOU THINK TO BE LIBERTY. 

3549
01:58:16,588 --> 01:58:19,992
>>  THAT IS THE CONCERN THAT 

3550
01:58:19,992 --> 01:58:23,963
SOME HAVE EXPRESSED ABOUT THE 

3551
01:58:23,963 --> 01:58:24,396
CONCEPT OF RIGHTS. 

3552
01:58:24,396 --> 01:58:27,099
>>  HERE'S THE CONCERN I HAVE. 

3553
01:58:27,099 --> 01:58:30,503
YOU HAVE ONE WORD THAT HAS 

3554
01:58:30,503 --> 01:58:32,071
OPENED UP THE ABILITY FOR FIVE 

3555
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:33,473
PEOPLE TO TELL EVERYBODY 

3556
01:58:33,473 --> 01:58:36,442
ELECTED IN THE COUNTRY, YOU 

3557
01:58:36,442 --> 01:58:38,377
CAN'T GO THERE. 

3558
01:58:38,377 --> 01:58:42,882
THAT THIS IS OFF LIMITS FOR A 

3559
01:58:42,882 --> 01:58:43,349
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. 

3560
01:58:43,349 --> 01:58:45,585
WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ROE V 

3561
01:58:45,585 --> 01:58:47,420
WADE OR NOT, JUST THINK WHAT 

3562
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:50,923
COULD HAPPEN DOWN THE ROAD IF 

3563
01:58:50,923 --> 01:58:55,294
FIVE PEOPLE DETERMINED THE WORD 

3564
01:58:55,294 --> 01:58:58,297
LIBERTY MEANS X. THE ONLY REAL 

3565
01:58:58,297 --> 01:58:59,332
CHECK AND BALANCE IS A 

3566
01:58:59,332 --> 01:59:00,533
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO 

3567
01:59:00,533 --> 01:59:01,300
CHANGE THE RULING. 

3568
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:03,202
DID YOU AGREE WITH THAT? 

3569
01:59:03,202 --> 01:59:06,639
>>  SENATOR, I'M NOT GOING TO 

3570
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:07,606
COMMENT ON POTENTIAL 

3571
01:59:07,606 --> 01:59:08,174
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. 

3572
01:59:08,174 --> 01:59:11,277
>>  IF WE PASS THE STATUTE 

3573
01:59:11,277 --> 01:59:17,583
TOMORROW IN CONGRESS, SAYING 

3574
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:21,721
THAT THE CONGRESS CAN REGULATE 

3575
01:59:21,721 --> 01:59:22,822
ABORTIONS BEFORE MEDICAL 

3576
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:27,793
VIABILITY, WOULDN'T THAT FLY IN 

3577
01:59:27,793 --> 01:59:29,562
THE FACE OF ROE V. WADE? 

3578
01:59:29,562 --> 01:59:31,130
>>  THE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT 

3579
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:31,364
-- 

3580
01:59:31,364 --> 01:59:33,799
>>  ALL OF US COULD VOTE, FIVE 

3581
01:59:33,799 --> 01:59:37,103
PEOPLE HAVE SAID LIBERTY MEANS 

3582
01:59:37,103 --> 01:59:40,673
RIGHT TO AN -- THE STATE HAS NO 

3583
01:59:40,673 --> 01:59:42,508
INTEREST HERE BEFORE MEDICAL 

3584
01:59:42,508 --> 01:59:42,808
VIABILITY. 

3585
01:59:42,808 --> 01:59:45,378
THAT WE CAN PASS ALL THE LAWS 

3586
01:59:45,378 --> 01:59:46,679
WE WANT, BECAUSE THEY FALL. 

3587
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:48,381
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN CHANGE THAT 

3588
01:59:48,381 --> 01:59:50,183
IS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 

3589
01:59:50,183 --> 01:59:51,484
PROCESS THAT REQUIRES 2/3 OF 

3590
01:59:51,484 --> 01:59:51,784
THE HOUSE. 

3591
01:59:51,784 --> 01:59:52,651
2/3 OF THE SENATE. 

3592
01:59:52,651 --> 01:59:53,819
3/4 OF THE STATE. 

3593
01:59:53,819 --> 01:59:56,889
IS THAT A PRETTY CORRECT LEGAL 

3594
01:59:56,889 --> 01:59:57,423
ANALYSIS? 

3595
01:59:57,423 --> 01:59:59,325
>>  WHEN THE SUPREME COURT 

3596
01:59:59,325 --> 02:00:02,228
ISSUED A  RULING -- 

3597
02:00:02,228 --> 02:00:04,363
>>  SO HERE'S THE POINT. 

3598
02:00:04,363 --> 02:00:06,232
WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ROE V. 

3599
02:00:06,232 --> 02:00:08,201
WADE OR NOT, THE REASON SOME 

3600
02:00:08,201 --> 02:00:11,304
LEGAL SCHOLARS OBJECT TO THIS 

3601
02:00:11,304 --> 02:00:13,039
CONCEPT IS BREATHTAKINGLY 

3602
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:13,339
UNLIMITED. 

3603
02:00:13,339 --> 02:00:14,707
WHATEVER FIVE PEOPLE BELIEVE AT 

3604
02:00:14,707 --> 02:00:16,075
ANY GIVEN TIME IN HISTORY, IN 

3605
02:00:16,075 --> 02:00:18,678
TERMS OF THE WORD LIBERTY, THEY 

3606
02:00:18,678 --> 02:00:19,679
CAN REWRITE OUR HISTORY AND 

3607
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:21,279
COME UP WITH A NEW HISTORY. 

3608
02:00:21,279 --> 02:00:23,316
I THINK THE BEST WAY FOR 

3609
02:00:23,316 --> 02:00:25,818
DEMOCRACY TO MAKE HISTORY IS TO 

3610
02:00:25,818 --> 02:00:27,520
HAVE THE COURTS INTERPRET THE 

3611
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:28,521
CONSTITUTION, A CHECK AND 

3612
02:00:28,521 --> 02:00:31,357
BALANCE ON US, BUT NOT TAKE ONE 

3613
02:00:31,357 --> 02:00:34,827
WORD AND CREATE A CONCEPT THAT 

3614
02:00:34,827 --> 02:00:37,229
IS BREATHTAKING IN TERMS OF THE 

3615
02:00:37,229 --> 02:00:39,332
APPLICATION TO RESTRICT THE 

3616
02:00:39,332 --> 02:00:39,799
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. 

3617
02:00:39,799 --> 02:00:41,233
NOW, WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ME 

3618
02:00:41,233 --> 02:00:43,736
OR NOT, I THINK THERE'S A 

3619
02:00:43,736 --> 02:00:44,103
GENUINE DEBATE. 

3620
02:00:44,103 --> 02:00:45,805
YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME IF IT 

3621
02:00:45,805 --> 02:00:47,807
WAS SOMETHING YOU LIKED OR YOU 

3622
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:53,012
WERE SUPPORTING THAT GOT SHUT 

3623
02:00:53,012 --> 02:00:53,212
OUT. 

3624
02:00:53,212 --> 02:00:54,579
OR YOU OPPOSED YOU COULDN'T DO. 

3625
02:00:54,579 --> 02:00:56,115
I HOPE THAT ONE DAY THE COURT 

3626
02:00:56,115 --> 02:00:58,017
WILL SIT DOWN AND THINK LONG 

3627
02:00:58,017 --> 02:01:01,053
AND HARD ABOUT THE PATH THEY'VE 

3628
02:01:01,053 --> 02:01:01,454
CHARTED. 

3629
02:01:01,454 --> 02:01:02,521
NOT JUST ABOUT ABORTION. 

3630
02:01:02,521 --> 02:01:04,223
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S RIGHT FOR 

3631
02:01:04,223 --> 02:01:06,225
PEOPLE IN YOUR BUSINESS ON ANY 

3632
02:01:06,225 --> 02:01:08,661
GIVEN DAY BASED ON ANY GIVEN 

3633
02:01:08,661 --> 02:01:10,229
CASE OF CONTROVERSY, TO SAY 

3634
02:01:10,229 --> 02:01:11,297
THAT THE WORD LIBERTY LOOKING 

3635
02:01:11,297 --> 02:01:13,566
AT THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY 

3636
02:01:13,566 --> 02:01:16,736
AND THE RIGHTS MEANS X. AND IT 

3637
02:01:16,736 --> 02:01:18,404
SHUTS OUT ALL OF US WHO HAVE 

3638
02:01:18,404 --> 02:01:20,906
GONE TO THE BALLOT BOX AND GONE 

3639
02:01:20,906 --> 02:01:25,344
THROUGH THE TEST OF BEING 

3640
02:01:25,344 --> 02:01:25,610
ELECTED. 

3641
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:28,114
I'LL ASK THAT YOU THINK ABOUT 

3642
02:01:28,114 --> 02:01:28,280
IT. 

3643
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:29,715
I ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 

3644
02:01:29,715 --> 02:01:31,950
SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK ABOUT. 

3645
02:01:31,950 --> 02:01:34,253
YOU SAID YOU WERE IN THE WHITE 

3646
02:01:34,253 --> 02:01:34,953
HOUSE ON 9/11. 

3647
02:01:34,953 --> 02:01:35,353
IS THAT CORRECT? 

3648
02:01:35,353 --> 02:01:37,322
>>  THAT IS CORRECT, SENATOR. 

3649
02:01:37,322 --> 02:01:41,560
>>  DID YOU BELIEVE AMERICA WAS 

3650
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:43,329
UNDER ATTACK? 

3651
02:01:43,329 --> 02:01:45,631
>>  YES. 

3652
02:01:45,631 --> 02:01:47,499
IN A WAY, IT WAS UNDER ATTACK. 

3653
02:01:47,499 --> 02:01:50,669
>>  DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF THE 

3654
02:01:50,669 --> 02:01:51,303
TERRORISTS COULD STRIKE ANY 

3655
02:01:51,303 --> 02:01:55,207
CITY IN THE WORLD, AND YOU GET 

3656
02:01:55,207 --> 02:01:56,908
ONE SHOT AT THE WORLD, BASED ON 

3657
02:01:56,908 --> 02:01:58,411
YOUR TIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE, 

3658
02:01:58,411 --> 02:02:00,813
DO YOU BELIEVE THEY WOULD PICK 

3659
02:02:00,813 --> 02:02:02,114
AN AMERICAN CITY OVER ANY OTHER 

3660
02:02:02,114 --> 02:02:02,615
CITY? 

3661
02:02:02,615 --> 02:02:04,149
>>  WELL, IT CERTAINLY SEEMED 

3662
02:02:04,149 --> 02:02:05,318
THAT NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON, 

3663
02:02:05,318 --> 02:02:06,485
D.C. WERE THE TWO TARGETS. 

3664
02:02:06,485 --> 02:02:08,454
>>  THE ONLY REASON I MENTION 

3665
02:02:08,454 --> 02:02:10,856
THAT TO MY GOOD FRIENDS, AND 

3666
02:02:10,856 --> 02:02:11,757
THEY ARE, WHO BELIEVE THAT 

3667
02:02:11,757 --> 02:02:14,660
AMERICA IS NOT PART OF THE 

3668
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:20,032
BATTLEFIELD, SURE WAS ON 9/11. 

3669
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:20,299
THE LAW. 

3670
02:02:20,299 --> 02:02:22,034
IF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN GOES TO 

3671
02:02:22,034 --> 02:02:24,403
AFGHANISTAN AND TAKES UP THE 

3672
02:02:24,403 --> 02:02:26,038
FIGHT AGAINST OUR FORCES AND 

3673
02:02:26,038 --> 02:02:27,106
CAPTURED IN AFGHANISTAN, THE 

3674
02:02:27,106 --> 02:02:29,041
CURRENT LAW IS YOU CAN BE 

3675
02:02:29,041 --> 02:02:32,645
HEALED  HELD AS AN ENEMY. 

3676
02:02:32,645 --> 02:02:33,846
>>  THAT'S WHAT THE SUPREME 

3677
02:02:33,846 --> 02:02:35,214
COURT SAID, WITH THE 

3678
02:02:35,214 --> 02:02:36,248
APPROPRIATE DUE PROCESS 

3679
02:02:36,248 --> 02:02:36,515
FINDINGS. 

3680
02:02:36,515 --> 02:02:37,816
>>  ABSOLUTELY. 

3681
02:02:37,816 --> 02:02:39,185
APPROPRIATE DUE PROCESS 

3682
02:02:39,185 --> 02:02:39,451
FINDINGS. 

3683
02:02:39,451 --> 02:02:40,052
HERE'S WHAT I WANT PEOPLE IN 

3684
02:02:40,052 --> 02:02:41,887
YOUR BUSINESS TO THINK ABOUT. 

3685
02:02:41,887 --> 02:02:44,857
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE FACT THAT 

3686
02:02:44,857 --> 02:02:46,459
THE RADICAL ISLAMIC GROUPS ARE 

3687
02:02:46,459 --> 02:02:49,061
TRYING TO RECRUIT AMERICANS TO 

3688
02:02:49,061 --> 02:02:49,494
THEIR CAUSE? 

3689
02:02:49,494 --> 02:02:50,963
OVER THE INTERNET, TRYING TO 

3690
02:02:50,963 --> 02:02:52,731
GET AMERICANS TO TAKE UP JIHAD? 

3691
02:02:52,731 --> 02:02:53,465
>>  YES. 

3692
02:02:53,465 --> 02:02:59,004
>>  THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN 

3693
02:02:59,004 --> 02:03:00,239
AMERICAN CITIZEN JOINING THEIR 

3694
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:01,040
CAUSE IS REAL. 

3695
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,341
BECAUSE THIS HAPPENED IN THE 

3696
02:03:02,341 --> 02:03:02,541
PAST. 

3697
02:03:02,541 --> 02:03:04,343
THE LIKELIHOOD OF IT HAPPENING 

3698
02:03:04,343 --> 02:03:08,680
IN THE FUTURE, I THINK, IS 

3699
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:12,985
HIGHLY LIKELY. 

3700
02:03:14,786 --> 02:03:16,155
IF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN 

3701
02:03:16,155 --> 02:03:18,090
ATTACKING THE EMBASSY IN COBLE 

3702
02:03:18,090 --> 02:03:19,859
CAN BE HELD AS AN AMERICAN 

3703
02:03:19,859 --> 02:03:21,861
CITIZEN, HERE'S THE QUESTION. 

3704
02:03:21,861 --> 02:03:23,795
CAN AN AMERICAN CITIZEN 

3705
02:03:23,795 --> 02:03:25,865
COLLABORATING WITH OTHER 

3706
02:03:25,865 --> 02:03:30,469
TERRORISTS BE HELD FOR 

3707
02:03:30,469 --> 02:03:31,703
ATTACKING THE CAPITAL? 

3708
02:03:31,703 --> 02:03:36,742
AND IF THEY CAN'T, YOU ARE 

3709
02:03:36,742 --> 02:03:37,810
INCENTIVIZING THE ENEMY, 

3710
02:03:37,810 --> 02:03:39,178
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRIVILEGE 

3711
02:03:39,178 --> 02:03:42,047
THAT NO OTHER TERRORIST WOULD 

3712
02:03:42,047 --> 02:03:42,348
HAVE. 

3713
02:03:42,348 --> 02:03:44,250
SO, YOU SAID SOMETHING VERY 

3714
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:44,750
COMPELLING TO ME. 

3715
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:46,785
THAT YOU APPLY THE LAW AND YOU 

3716
02:03:46,785 --> 02:03:50,089
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT 

3717
02:03:50,089 --> 02:03:50,456
AFFECTS PEOPLE. 

3718
02:03:50,456 --> 02:03:50,689
RIGHT? 

3719
02:03:50,689 --> 02:03:51,056
>>  YES, SIR. 

3720
02:03:51,056 --> 02:03:52,858
>>  I HOPE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND 

3721
02:03:52,858 --> 02:03:54,994
THAT THIS WAR IS NOT OVER. 

3722
02:03:54,994 --> 02:03:57,563
THE WAR IS COMING BACK TO OUR 

3723
02:03:57,563 --> 02:03:57,796
SHORES. 

3724
02:03:57,796 --> 02:03:58,864
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME 

3725
02:03:58,864 --> 02:04:00,266
BEFORE THEY HIT US AGAIN. 

3726
02:04:00,266 --> 02:04:02,835
BECAUSE BUT HAVE TO BE RIGHT 

3727
02:04:02,835 --> 02:04:05,404
ALL THE TIME AND THEY HAVE TO 

3728
02:04:05,404 --> 02:04:06,438
BE RIGHT ONE TIME. 

3729
02:04:06,438 --> 02:04:08,641
I HOPE WE DON'T CREATE A 

3730
02:04:08,641 --> 02:04:11,043
PROCESS WHERE IF YOU CAN COME 

3731
02:04:11,043 --> 02:04:14,046
TO AMERICA, YOU GET A SPECIAL 

3732
02:04:14,046 --> 02:04:14,447
DEAL. 

3733
02:04:14,447 --> 02:04:16,549
MAKES IT HARDER FOR US TO DEAL 

3734
02:04:16,549 --> 02:04:19,385
WITH YOU AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU 

3735
02:04:19,385 --> 02:04:19,685
KNOW. 

3736
02:04:19,685 --> 02:04:21,086
WE TREAT YOU AS A COMMON 

3737
02:04:21,086 --> 02:04:24,690
CRIMINAL VERSUS THE WARRIOR 

3738
02:04:24,690 --> 02:04:25,057
YOU'VE BECOME. 

3739
02:04:25,057 --> 02:04:28,193
THAT'S JUST MY PARTING THOUGHT 

3740
02:04:28,193 --> 02:04:29,195
TO YOU. 

3741
02:04:29,195 --> 02:04:30,362
AND YOU'LL DECIDE THE WAY YOU 

3742
02:04:30,362 --> 02:04:36,202
THINK IS BEST FOR THE COUNTRY. 

3743
02:04:36,202 --> 02:04:39,205
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO 

3744
02:04:39,205 --> 02:04:44,543
SAY ABOUT THIS PROCESS THAT 

3745
02:04:44,543 --> 02:04:47,046
WOULD HELP US MAKE IT BETTER? 

3746
02:04:47,046 --> 02:04:49,348
YOU'RE GOING TO GET CONFIRMED. 

3747
02:04:49,348 --> 02:04:51,850
I WORRY ABOUT THE PEOPLE COMING 

3748
02:04:51,850 --> 02:04:52,150
AFTER YOU. 

3749
02:04:52,150 --> 02:04:54,386
EVERY TIME WE HAVE ONE OF THESE 

3750
02:04:54,386 --> 02:04:55,988
HEARINGS, IT GETS WORSE AND 

3751
02:04:55,988 --> 02:04:56,722
WORSE AND WORSE. 

3752
02:04:56,722 --> 02:04:59,225
YOU SAT THERE PATIENTLY FOR A 

3753
02:04:59,225 --> 02:05:00,392
COUPLE OF DAYS. 

3754
02:05:00,392 --> 02:05:05,497
MY COLLEAGUES ASKED YOU TOUGH 

3755
02:05:05,497 --> 02:05:05,797
QUESTIONS. 

3756
02:05:05,797 --> 02:05:06,498
SOMETIMES UNFAIR QUESTIONS. 

3757
02:05:06,498 --> 02:05:11,370
YOUR TIME IS ABOUT OVER. 

3758
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:12,937
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT. 

3759
02:05:12,937 --> 02:05:14,673
YOU WOULD BE SMART NOT TO 

3760
02:05:14,673 --> 02:05:15,174
ANSWER AT ALL. 

3761
02:05:15,174 --> 02:05:16,542
I WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO 

3762
02:05:16,542 --> 02:05:18,577
TELL US, WHAT COULD WE DO 

3763
02:05:18,577 --> 02:05:19,311
BETTER, IF ANYTHING? 

3764
02:05:19,311 --> 02:05:21,280
>>  SENATOR, I'M GOING TO THANK 

3765
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,048
ALL THE SENATORS ON THE 

3766
02:05:23,048 --> 02:05:24,649
COMMITTEE AND ALL THE SENATORS 

3767
02:05:24,649 --> 02:05:26,485
NOT ON THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR 

3768
02:05:26,485 --> 02:05:27,253
TIME AND CARE. 

3769
02:05:27,253 --> 02:05:28,887
AS I SAID, EACH SENATOR IS 

3770
02:05:28,887 --> 02:05:30,389
COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND 

3771
02:05:30,389 --> 02:05:31,991
THE PUBLIC GOOD, IN MY OPINION, 

3772
02:05:31,991 --> 02:05:34,293
AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE TIME 

3773
02:05:34,293 --> 02:05:37,096
OF THE SENATORS AND I'M ON THE 

3774
02:05:37,096 --> 02:05:38,998
SUNRISE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN 

3775
02:05:38,998 --> 02:05:39,999
AND OPTIMIST ABOUT THE FUTURE. 

3776
02:05:39,999 --> 02:05:41,834
>>  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

3777
02:05:41,834 --> 02:05:46,972
>>  BEFORE WE BREAK, I WANT TO 

3778
02:05:46,972 --> 02:05:48,340
BRING UP SOME INFORMATION, 

3779
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:49,275
BECAUSE I WAS WONDERING HOW 

3780
02:05:49,275 --> 02:05:51,343
LONG IT WOULD TAKE THE NATIONAL 

3781
02:05:51,343 --> 02:05:53,445
ARCHIVES TO GET THE MATERIAL 

3782
02:05:53,445 --> 02:05:55,447
THAT WE NEEDED, BECAUSE YOU'VE 

3783
02:05:55,447 --> 02:05:59,284
HEARD SEVERAL TIMES THAT THE 

3784
02:05:59,284 --> 02:06:02,888
ARCHIVES, IT'S THEIR 

3785
02:06:02,888 --> 02:06:03,255
RESPONSIBILITY. 

3786
02:06:03,255 --> 02:06:06,892
THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES HAS 13 

3787
02:06:06,892 --> 02:06:08,727
ARCHIVISTS WHO HANDLED GEORGE 

3788
02:06:08,727 --> 02:06:10,796
W. BUSH'S PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS. 

3789
02:06:10,796 --> 02:06:14,199
THEY CAN ONLY REVIEW ABOUT 

3790
02:06:14,199 --> 02:06:15,300
1,000 PAGES PER WEEK. 

3791
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:18,070
WE COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN THESE 

3792
02:06:18,070 --> 02:06:19,872
DOCUMENTS FOR 37 WEEKS. 

3793
02:06:19,872 --> 02:06:21,373
IF WE DIDN'T GET PRESIDENT 

3794
02:06:21,373 --> 02:06:23,208
BUSH'S TEAM TO EXPEDITE THE 

3795
02:06:23,208 --> 02:06:24,877
REVIEW PROCESS FOR THE BENEFIT 

3796
02:06:24,877 --> 02:06:26,845
OF ALL MEMBERS OF THE 

3797
02:06:26,845 --> 02:06:27,212
COMMITTEE. 

3798
02:06:27,212 --> 02:06:28,647
WE RECEIVED ALL THE DOCUMENTS 

3799
02:06:28,647 --> 02:06:31,750
WE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE 

3800
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:34,887
ARCHIVIST, JUST AS A FASTER AND 

3801
02:06:34,887 --> 02:06:35,220
FASTER TIME. 

3802
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:41,527
WE'LL NOW TAKE 15 MINUTES AND 

3803
02:06:41,527 --> 02:06:45,798
RESUME AT 12:22. 

3804
02:06:58,277 --> 02:07:00,479
>>> IT LOOKS LIKE THE 

3805
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:01,480
CONFIRMATION HEARING IS TAKING 

3806
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:01,813
A BREAK. 

3807
02:07:01,813 --> 02:07:05,084
A 15 MINUTE RECESS. 

3808
02:07:05,084 --> 02:07:10,489
TODAY WAS NOT PERHAPS AS 

3809
02:07:10,489 --> 02:07:11,289
PASSIONATE AS YESTERDAY WAS. 

3810
02:07:11,289 --> 02:07:13,492
THERE WERE A FEW PROTESTERS, 

3811
02:07:13,492 --> 02:07:15,294
BUT NOWHERE NEAR WHAT WE SAW 

3812
02:07:15,294 --> 02:07:15,594
YESTERDAY. 

3813
02:07:15,594 --> 02:07:17,296
BUT IT STARTED WITH SOME 

3814
02:07:17,296 --> 02:07:18,197
FIREWORKS WITH COREY BOOKER, 

3815
02:07:18,197 --> 02:07:19,598
AND WE DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME 

3816
02:07:19,598 --> 02:07:21,032
WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. 

3817
02:07:21,032 --> 02:07:22,301
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE 

3818
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:24,002
RELEASE OF A MEMO THAT WAS 

3819
02:07:24,002 --> 02:07:25,504
LEAKED AS THE CONFIRMATION 

3820
02:07:25,504 --> 02:07:26,004
HEARING WAS UNFOLDING. 

3821
02:07:26,004 --> 02:07:30,275
>>  THE MEMO, IN FACT, HAD TO 

3822
02:07:30,275 --> 02:07:33,679
DO WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

3823
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:33,946
WRITINGS. 

3824
02:07:33,946 --> 02:07:35,314
THE CONTROVERSIAL ROE V. WADE 

3825
02:07:35,314 --> 02:07:36,548
DECISION, AND ALSO WITH 

3826
02:07:36,548 --> 02:07:38,283
SOMETHING RELATED TO 

3827
02:07:38,283 --> 02:07:38,750
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. 

3828
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:41,186
COREY BOOKER WANTED TO RELEASE 

3829
02:07:41,186 --> 02:07:42,421
THE MEMO OF THE OTHER SIDE 

3830
02:07:42,421 --> 02:07:44,022
ARGUED THAT IT WASN'T BEING 

3831
02:07:44,022 --> 02:07:45,690
RELEASED BECAUSE OF NATIONAL 

3832
02:07:45,690 --> 02:07:46,124
SECURITY INTERESTS. 

3833
02:07:46,124 --> 02:07:50,496
HE GOT INTO IT A LITTLE WITH 

3834
02:07:50,496 --> 02:07:51,830
SENATOR JOHN OF TEXAS. 

3835
02:07:51,830 --> 02:07:52,998
COREY BOOKER ESSENTIALLY 

3836
02:07:52,998 --> 02:07:55,100
SAYING, I'M WILLING TO GIVE UP 

3837
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:56,301
BEING A SENATOR TO RELEASE THIS 

3838
02:07:56,301 --> 02:07:58,370
INFORMATION AND IF YOU WANT TO 

3839
02:07:58,370 --> 02:08:00,372
GO AFTER ME FOR BEING A 

3840
02:08:00,372 --> 02:08:02,474
SENATOR, BRING IT, IS THE QUOTE 

3841
02:08:02,474 --> 02:08:02,975
HE SAID. 

3842
02:08:02,975 --> 02:08:04,076
ULTIMATELY, IT WAS INTRODUCED 

3843
02:08:04,076 --> 02:08:05,778
INTO THE RECORD AND SENATOR 

3844
02:08:05,778 --> 02:08:07,312
FEINSTEIN ASKED HIM ABOUT IT 

3845
02:08:07,312 --> 02:08:09,682
AND AS HE HAS OVER THE COURSE 

3846
02:08:09,682 --> 02:08:12,084
OF THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, HE 

3847
02:08:12,084 --> 02:08:14,720
SORT OF USED JUDICIAL PRECEDENT 

3848
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:15,687
IN NAMING THE FACT THAT THE 

3849
02:08:15,687 --> 02:08:16,621
CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME 

3850
02:08:16,621 --> 02:08:18,524
COURT HAVE NOT ANSWERED 

3851
02:08:18,524 --> 02:08:19,324
QUESTIONS REGARDING THE CASES 

3852
02:08:19,324 --> 02:08:21,593
THAT COULD COME UP BEFORE THE 

3853
02:08:21,593 --> 02:08:22,961
BENCH, ALTHOUGH HE DID ADDRESS 

3854
02:08:22,961 --> 02:08:25,097
WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO SAY IN 

3855
02:08:25,097 --> 02:08:25,397
THE E-MAIL. 

3856
02:08:25,397 --> 02:08:27,533
>>  I THINK WE HAVE THAT 

3857
02:08:27,533 --> 02:08:27,800
EXCHANGE. 

3858
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:29,701
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT EXCHANGE 

3859
02:08:29,701 --> 02:08:30,803
WITH COREY BOOKER, IF WE COULD 

3860
02:08:30,803 --> 02:08:32,271
PLAY THAT, SO PEOPLE GET AN 

3861
02:08:32,271 --> 02:08:32,471
IDEA. 

3862
02:08:32,471 --> 02:08:35,407
>>  NO SENATE RULE AND NO 

3863
02:08:35,407 --> 02:08:36,775
HISTORY OF THE SENATE ACCOUNTS 

3864
02:08:36,775 --> 02:08:42,681
FOR WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. 

3865
02:08:42,681 --> 02:08:47,252
THAT WAS FOLLOWING THIS ARCHIVE 

3866
02:08:47,252 --> 02:08:48,020
PARTISAN OPERATIVE, FOLLOWING 

3867
02:08:48,020 --> 02:08:56,628
HIS VOMIT  PROCESS. MANY OF 

3868
02:08:56,628 --> 02:08:58,297
THESE DOCUMENTS WERE DUMPED IN 

3869
02:08:58,297 --> 02:08:58,763
THE LAST MINUTE. 

3870
02:08:58,763 --> 02:09:01,666
THE SENATOR MADE A GOOD POINT. 

3871
02:09:01,666 --> 02:09:03,302
I KNOWINGLY VIOLATED THE RULES 

3872
02:09:03,302 --> 02:09:05,704
THAT WERE PUT FORTH AND I'M 

3873
02:09:05,704 --> 02:09:09,341
TOLD THAT THE CONFIDENTIAL 

3874
02:09:09,341 --> 02:09:10,308
RULES HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES. 

3875
02:09:10,308 --> 02:09:13,178
SO, SIR, I COME FROM A LONG 

3876
02:09:13,178 --> 02:09:14,079
LINE AS AMERICANS, UNDERSTAND 

3877
02:09:14,079 --> 02:09:16,415
WHAT THAT KIND OF CIVIL 

3878
02:09:16,415 --> 02:09:16,815
DISOBEDIENCE IS. 

3879
02:09:16,815 --> 02:09:18,784
AND I UNDERSTAND THE 

3880
02:09:18,784 --> 02:09:19,318
CONSEQUENCES. 

3881
02:09:19,318 --> 02:09:22,321
I AM RIGHT NOW BEFORE YOUR 

3882
02:09:22,321 --> 02:09:23,222
PROCESS IS FINISHED, I AM GOING 

3883
02:09:23,222 --> 02:09:26,625
TO RELEASE THE E-MAIL ABOUT 

3884
02:09:26,625 --> 02:09:27,058
RACIAL PROFILING. 

3885
02:09:27,058 --> 02:09:28,927
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PENALTY 

3886
02:09:28,927 --> 02:09:31,530
COMES WITH OUSTING FROM THE 

3887
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:33,432
SENATE. 

3888
02:09:33,432 --> 02:09:35,234
AND IF SENATOR CORNYN BELIEVES 

3889
02:09:35,234 --> 02:09:37,135
I VIOLATED SENATE RULES, I 

3890
02:09:37,135 --> 02:09:39,204
OPENLY INVITE AND ACCEPT THE 

3891
02:09:39,204 --> 02:09:40,172
CONSEQUENCES OF MY TEAM 

3892
02:09:40,172 --> 02:09:41,606
RELEASING THAT E-MAIL RIGHT 

3893
02:09:41,606 --> 02:09:43,208
NOW. 

3894
02:09:43,208 --> 02:09:44,109
I'M RELEASING IT TO EXPOSE 

3895
02:09:44,109 --> 02:09:45,878
NUMBER ONE, THE E MA ILLS ARE 

3896
02:09:45,878 --> 02:09:48,881
BEING HELD FROM THE PUBLIC, 

3897
02:09:48,881 --> 02:09:51,683
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH 

3898
02:09:51,683 --> 02:09:52,117
NATIONAL SECURITY. 

3899
02:09:52,117 --> 02:09:55,420
>>  SO, ULTIMATELY, THAT E-MAIL 

3900
02:09:55,420 --> 02:09:57,122
WAS RELEASED INTO THE PUBLIC 

3901
02:09:57,122 --> 02:09:57,355
RECORD. 

3902
02:09:57,355 --> 02:10:00,425
WE ALSO WANT TO PLAY FOR YOUR 

3903
02:10:00,425 --> 02:10:03,328
OUR AUDIENCE, IN EXCHANGE WITH 

3904
02:10:03,328 --> 02:10:03,895
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 

3905
02:10:03,895 --> 02:10:08,533
>>  ULTIMATELY, A PORTION OF IT 

3906
02:10:08,533 --> 02:10:11,904
HAS TO DO WITH ROE V. WADE, AND 

3907
02:10:11,904 --> 02:10:15,007
WHETHER OR NOT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

3908
02:10:15,007 --> 02:10:17,209
BELIEVES IT -- A COMMENT HE 

3909
02:10:17,209 --> 02:10:20,879
SUGGEST BE REMOVED FROM A MEMO. 

3910
02:10:20,879 --> 02:10:21,446
DIANNE FEINSTEIN ASKED HIM 

3911
02:10:21,446 --> 02:10:21,746
ABOUT THAT. 

3912
02:10:21,746 --> 02:10:26,285
>>  SO YOU BELIEVE IT IS 

3913
02:10:26,285 --> 02:10:26,752
CORRECTLY SETTLED. 

3914
02:10:26,752 --> 02:10:28,520
IS IT CORRECT LAW IN YOUR VIEW? 

3915
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:33,425
>>  SENATOR, ON THAT CASE, OR 

3916
02:10:33,425 --> 02:10:36,929
ON DICKERSON OR ON CASES, LIKE 

3917
02:10:36,929 --> 02:10:39,731
CITIZENS UNITED OR UNITED 

3918
02:10:39,731 --> 02:10:41,633
STATES VERSUS LOPEZ, JUST THE 

3919
02:10:41,633 --> 02:10:42,334
WHOLE BODY OF MODERN SUPREME 

3920
02:10:42,334 --> 02:10:44,303
COURT CASE LAW, I HAVE TO 

3921
02:10:44,303 --> 02:10:45,304
FOLLOW WHAT THE NOMINEES WHO 

3922
02:10:45,304 --> 02:10:47,239
HAVE BEEN IN THIS SEAT BEFORE 

3923
02:10:47,239 --> 02:10:47,539
HAVE DONE. 

3924
02:10:47,539 --> 02:10:52,911
>>  JUDGE, A YES OR A NO WILL 

3925
02:10:52,911 --> 02:10:53,679
DO. 

3926
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:56,315
>>  BRIEFLY, I'LL TRY TO BE 

3927
02:10:56,315 --> 02:10:57,182
BRIEF. 

3928
02:10:57,182 --> 02:10:58,984
WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS SEAT, I'M 

3929
02:10:58,984 --> 02:11:00,552
NOT JUST SITTING HERE FOR 

3930
02:11:00,552 --> 02:11:00,785
MYSELF. 

3931
02:11:00,785 --> 02:11:02,354
I'M SITTING HERE AS A 

3932
02:11:02,354 --> 02:11:04,022
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE JUDICIARY 

3933
02:11:04,022 --> 02:11:06,725
AND THE OBLIGATION TO PRESERVE 

3934
02:11:06,725 --> 02:11:08,260
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE 

3935
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:09,528
JUDICIARY, WHICH YOU CARE 

3936
02:11:09,528 --> 02:11:09,861
DEEPLY ABOUT. 

3937
02:11:09,861 --> 02:11:12,164
ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE DONE IS 

3938
02:11:12,164 --> 02:11:12,831
STUDIED CAREFULLY WHAT NOMINEES 

3939
02:11:12,831 --> 02:11:14,933
HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. 

3940
02:11:14,933 --> 02:11:18,603
WHAT I REFERRED TO AS NOMINEE 

3941
02:11:18,603 --> 02:11:18,903
PRECEDENT. 

3942
02:11:18,903 --> 02:11:19,905
REALLY ALL THE JUSTICES HAVE 

3943
02:11:19,905 --> 02:11:23,108
NOT GIVEN HINTS OR FORECASTS OR 

3944
02:11:23,108 --> 02:11:24,409
PREVIEWS AND JUSTICE KAGAN 

3945
02:11:24,409 --> 02:11:26,011
CAPTURED IT WELL, AS SHE OFTEN 

3946
02:11:26,011 --> 02:11:27,112
DOES, WITH TALKING ABOUT 

3947
02:11:27,112 --> 02:11:28,847
QUESTIONS LIKE THE ONE YOU'RE 

3948
02:11:28,847 --> 02:11:29,081
ASKING. 

3949
02:11:29,081 --> 02:11:31,616
YOU CAN'T GIVE A THUMB'S UP OR 

3950
02:11:31,616 --> 02:11:35,253
THUMBS DOWN AND MAINTAIN THE 

3951
02:11:35,253 --> 02:11:35,553
JUDICIARY. 

3952
02:11:35,553 --> 02:11:37,155
I NEED TO FOLLOW THAT NOMINEE 

3953
02:11:37,155 --> 02:11:37,522
PRECEDENT HERE. 

3954
02:11:37,522 --> 02:11:39,458
>>  SO, THE NOMINEE PRECEDENT 

3955
02:11:39,458 --> 02:11:40,859
SAID, DON'T GO ON THE RECORD 

3956
02:11:40,859 --> 02:11:42,394
ABOUT ANYTHING, IF YOU DON'T 

3957
02:11:42,394 --> 02:11:42,661
HAVE TO. 

3958
02:11:42,661 --> 02:11:45,530
>>  SO, THAT'S WHERE WE ARE 

3959
02:11:45,530 --> 02:11:45,830
RIGHT NOW. 

3960
02:11:45,830 --> 02:11:47,332
WE EXPECT THAT THIS HEARING 

3961
02:11:47,332 --> 02:11:49,368
WILL PICK UP IN ABOUT 15 

3962
02:11:49,368 --> 02:11:50,769
MINUTES OR SO. 

3963
02:11:50,769 --> 02:11:52,304
BUT WHILE WE AWAIT FOR JUDGE 

3964
02:11:52,304 --> 02:11:54,306
KAVANAUGH TO GET BACK INTO THAT 

3965
02:11:54,306 --> 02:11:55,207
SENATE HEARING ROOM, LET'S GIVE 

3966
02:11:55,207 --> 02:11:58,410
YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHAT'S 

3967
02:11:58,410 --> 02:11:59,311
HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF 

3968
02:11:59,311 --> 02:12:00,512
WASHINGTON, D.C., INCLUDING 

3969
