in the aftermath of being arrested at a fitness club but the question arises is 34 year-old Eric Stagg know a weirdo or is he someone who is representative of the Joker's worldview see I'm not a monster I'm just ahead of the curve so Eric's tagged no of Haverhill Massachusetts decided to drop by his friendly neighborhood Planet Fitness franchise he went into the locker room took off his street clothes and emerged into the yoga studio completely naked oops surely a mistake his mind was elsewhere perhaps and he forgot to throw on his gym attire in order to do the whole downward dog ething he but no as commotion regarding stag no clad only in his birthday suit erupted it seemed became clearly apparent that this was no mistake but completely premeditated you see stag now pointed to the marketing slogan of Planet Fitness which is to say this gym is a quote judgment free zone end quote and apparently he had no issue at all but people who might want to judge his private parts alas and alack looks like there's judgement galore when it comes to naked dudes in a co-ed fitness facility when it comes to the display of wedding tackle the police were soon called and poor mr. stag no was charged with indecent exposure lewdness and disorderly conduct but really was a deserving of such a legalistic smackdown for where oh where were the usual suspects who chant the do regular mantras of who are we to say what is right and wrong and who are we to be judgmental whenever anything traditional in society gets inserted into the politically correct paper shredder we see this especially when it comes to transgender issues remember the outrage that erupted last year when jock wing Wilson yang a man transitioning into a woman visited a Toronto woman spa body bliss and was told that he or she wasn't welcome there oh how the cries of discrimination immediately reverberating throughout this mean streets of hog town and poor body bliss and during those screams of transphobia even though the majority of the spa's woman patrons were reportedly horrified by the impromptu sausage fest that had taken lease near the hot tub but those gals were clearly bigots heck even the then NDP member of provincial Parliament for High Park Cheri diNovo released a statement criticizing the spa for what she described as blatant transphobia and a violation of the interior Human Rights Code and hey let us also never forget the precedent setting legal verdict of Gwen Jacob Gwen was charged with committing an indecent act for taking off her top on a hot summer day in Guelph Ontario in 1991 but in 1995 a court overturned her conviction clearing the way for a woman to go topless in public as an aside I haven't seen the entero sisterhood embraced their topless rights in the 23 year period since scoring a victory for mammary gland freedom but I digress then again Gwen Jacob did tell the CBC quote there's a huge lag between what gets legalized and what gets normalized end quote so perhaps we need a few more years or decades to pass before women in Ontario will finally embrace their newfound charter rights by turning this province into a Russ Meyer movie set all of which brings me back to poor mr. stag know if we can all go topless in public in some jurisdictions is it not high time since this is 2018 after all to go bottomless as well it's not as far-fetched as you may think folks last month in Toronto no nudists were arrested for displaying their bits and pieces during something called The Naked Bike Ride indeed far from being arrested for public indecency Toronto's finest actually gave these dudes a police escort all of which is to say that I remain thoroughly and utterly confused so perhaps in the here and now Eric stag nail will be painted as a pervert but give this mindset a few more years folks for me thinks mr. stag no will one day be celebrated at least by the usual suspects on the progressive side as a visionary even though to be quite frank most normal people now and in the future I suspect really don't want to envision his junk for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the Breville has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
