there's a school<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Silicon Valley that</font>

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:11,040
doesn't allow the use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any tech it's</font>

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,830
called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> walled off school and it's</font>

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,740
fascinating<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the school has no</font>

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,260
computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> no iPads no iPhones they try</font>

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:42,270
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimize tech altogether people enjoy</font>

7
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,680
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time face-to-face they go</font>

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,570
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's interesting about</font>

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,870
execs which is striking these are people

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,989
who publicly will expand on the wonders

13
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the products they're producing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and at</font>

14
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,800
the same time they<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided in all their</font>

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">wisdom that their kids didn't belong in</font>
