the burden of proof is on Omarosa not Trump so I don't want to rehash the whole Omarosa story about trumpet ledger Li using the n-word just look at what Katrina Pierson has been saying about this she's doing a great job and consider the attitude and behavior of Omarosa in the past but my biggest concern here is the way the press are dealing with it this stuff is Goldust to them it's a radical claim a serious claim and they didn't even make it which means they are free to report on it however they like the press take no responsibility in these situations the burden of proof is on the people who make these claims not Trump and the press make no effort to pressure those who make these claims to provide evidence instead they have doubled down and used Omarosa as another stick to beat Trump with why isn't CNN investigating the story why aren't the national press putting more pressure on Omarosa than Trump it's not the first time this kind of thing has happened either just look at this great example from Huffington Post a tape might exist of Trump doing something in an elevator though exactly where that somewhere is and what that something might be no one in the media can say because no one in the media seems to have seen the tape or is even confident it exists so a tape might exist of Trump doing something okay you got it helping tonneaus get the pitchforks out and this tweet from The Associated Press The Associated Press has deleted a tweet about u.s. representative Keith Ellison that incorrectly described abuse allegations against him a corrected tweet is upcoming and someone on Twitter was mocking the Associated Press by tweeting breaking we are rewriting breaking news because the original breaking news was broken so eager to get a breaking news story that they'll easily publish something that is inaccurate who is responsible for this will the press ever entertain the idea that they might be so biased they don't even realize they're doing something like this but it's interesting they only rewrite the article when it's keith Ellison someone that supports an Tifa and has the press ever been so vague in their attacks on a president in history before has the press ever placed the burden of proof on the victim of lies and not the person telling the lies this is what happens through the press to major political figures and it's what happens in society to normal decent people by far left activists like Ann Tifa believe me when I tell you that the only way that the press will stop speculating about what Trump said is if this recording actually exists and was released and then if it were released they'd start a brand new anti Trump campaign therefore you can't win you just cannot win with the press if something doesn't exist they'll speculate lie create empty stories that talk about the thing that doesn't exist if it does exist they'll slam you move on to the next story and speculate about something brand new it's just a matter of time until they start claiming that Trump was secretly in the KKK if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you you
