well the images suggests those of concentration camps families being cut apart children ripped from their parents what country would do this what good country would allow it this is Donald Trump's doing what we are seeing is what he wanted people to see when a desperate people on the other side of the border to see what an Americans to see and one of Democrats to see so they would build his wall but is this a step too far Donald Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it is separating kids from their parents what he was had in mind is this proof of what he can get away with or is it beyond even what his people will swallow good evening I'm Chris Matthews in Washington our Father's Day weekend over it President Trump and his administration came under intense criticism for their so-called zero tolerance immigration policy resulting in forced family separations much of the mounting public outcry was sparked by images like these of small children looking on as u.s. Border Patrol officers detained their parents then there are the newly released recordings of sobbing children at a detention facility and be seen as as not apt eyes that has obtained that following audio from a civil rights attorney who said he received it from a client let's listen for your audience nBC has not been able to independently authenticate that recording well late today DHS secretary Kirsten Nielsen doubled down on the policy refusing to apologize instead she insists that the administration would continue to prosecute all criminals DHS is no longer ignoring the law we are enforcing the laws as they exist on the books as long as illegal entry remains a criminal offense DHS will not look the other way despite the mounting threats for the president has also pushed back against criticism immigration is the fault and all of the problems that we're having because we cannot get them to sign legislation we cannot get them even to the negotiating table and I say it's very strongly the Democrats fault the United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility we'll be seeking to deflect the president's continuously laid blame at the feet of Democrats but those comments contradict statements by his own attorney general and chief of staff who helped champion this policy I have put in place a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry on our southwest border if you are smuggling a child then we will prosecute you and that child may be separated from you as required by law a big name of the game is deterrence if a family separation stands as a pretty tough learn it could be a tough deterrent a much faster turnaround on asylums even though people say that's cruel and heartless to take a mother away from her children yeah I think cruel and heartless I wouldn't put it quite that way the children will be taken care of yeah to put into foster care whatever but the big point is they elected to come illegally into the United States and this is a technique that no one hopes will be used extensively or for very long according to the New York Times zero tolerance which the administration proudly rolled out back in May is the brainchild of senior policy adviser Stephen Miller Miller told the New York Times that rolling out the policy was a simple decision by the administration he Washington Post this also reported the president seeing political advantage and all of this according to White House officials the president's calculated that he will gain political leverage and congressional negotiations by continuing to enforce a policy he claims to hate tell me right now is NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker Peter Baker's chief White House correspondent for the New York Times Jennifer Rubens opinion writer for The Washington Post and NBC's Jacob Soboroff is outside one of the country's largest immigration processing centers that are McAllen Texas I want to start with Craig with Kristen Kristen it seems like is these to say in the old cowboy movies this administration is speaking with a forked tongue two different messages coming out at the same time one is this is our policy of zero tolerance and we believe in it we got it separate they Kevin we got to put these parents on trial and the other part I though the statement coming out from the Secretary of Homeland Security was oh yeah and by the way if you want to change this go ahead and do it because we'd like you to do that we want to change the policy we believe it that makes no sense to a person listening I think that's why this is such a growing crisis for this administration you heard those two different messages on display in the briefing that was given by DHS secretary Kirsten Nielsen and then Sarah Sanders who came to the podium just moments later who really stressed that the president hates this policy wants to see it changed is bothered by it secretary Nielsen really dug in on the fact that look this is a crisis that was created by past administrations is it a policy that this president is responsible for or not I tried to press Kirsten Wilson on that very point and said look the bottom line is this started when the Attorney General announced that zero tolerance policy if the president hates it why doesn't he pick up the phone and change it she of course punted she put the blame on Congress Chris but it's becoming very difficult for them to explain this and to frankly be on the same page it looks to me you know covering politics all these years and looking at her she did a very good job today of defending what can't be defended basically they want to change the policy but they're proud of it is in detention is she on the line right here for her job I think this is a critical test for her we know that she was essentially picked by chief of staff John Kelly ultimately President Trump got on board with this but there have been some tensions behind the scenes some differences of approach at some points the president has expressed the fact that he doesn't feel as though she's securing the border enough and so I think this is a critical test that briefing was a critical test for her will she be able to keep this up that's a big question he undoubtedly was watching that briefing today and she raised a lot of tough questions Chris well last question you and this is the one I want your answer you're on television you broadcast you get the message across I try to do the same thing the president is very good at creating reality TV he creates a world through television this is a television show that nobody wants to watch no American wants to watch kids and hear them cry kids crying when they normally cry at church is fine but these kids are crying because of policy because their parents have been taken away from them that's why they're crying how can the president defend what he knows is a lousy reality show I think he's struggling to do it Chris I think you saw that when he surprised us and came out here on the North Lawn on Friday and we peppered him with questions about this the humanity of it he got very upset and pointed the finger at Democrats that's his tactic right now to point the finger at Democrats it's a tough argument to make though because of course this is his own zero-tolerance policy I do think that we have seen President Trump dig in when it comes to having a fight he rarely backs away from a tough fight Chris and we're watching that unfold right now even though as you rightfully point out these images are not what Americans want to see it's not what the president's not what the first lady wants to be watching I think the question is will he at any point back away from this fight just tonight we learned that Senator Ted Cruz is introducing emergency legislation so the pressure is mounting on this president to do something he knows that he does have the power to do it the question is will he christen this great watching today I love the back-and-forth I think you hit them right on the head with the problem the contradiction in this policy a policy they put claim they and they invented and they want to get rid of it but they blame the Democrats for not getting rid of it this is crazy talk let me go to Jacob so broath who's down at the reality that exists down there not just a TV show Jacob tell us what you see down there what we should know let me just also sing Kristen's praises Chris she asked a question that we still don't have an answer to which is where the toddlers where are the girls we've been a given access to two of 100 facilities run by Health and Human Services across the country where these separated child migrants are being held and I've been in one of them NBC's Gotti Schwartz has been in another we haven't seen any girls or toddlers what we do know and what I would like to know what the president would react if he got to see what I saw in that facility is it 1,100 young kids have been separated from their family right here in the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol sector and in this building right here the McAllen processing center there were 1200 people last night and when you walk in there and there's talk of are there cages are there not cages what do you want to call them let me tell you something right now there are cages they look like dog kennels there are not just adults or families together there are young children sitting in there and an increasing number of young children are sitting in those cages because they were separated from their parents and more being separated every single day it makes you sick to look at and I would like to know what the president would think if he was actually inside there would he feel the same way that the Secretary of Homeland Security said she's been down here and she's been inside these detention centers I'd like to know if she has she been down here since the separation policy was put into place as she talked to the Border Patrol agents who say they're stressed that even if they support this policy they don't have the resources to keep up the four social workers that were in there last night having to deal with an increasing number of children separated from their parents because of this very policy and it's not a democratic policy it's a policy put into place by Donald Trump well who put together the policy of separating boys from girls and younger kids from the older kids that is really concentration camp stuff that's Sophie's Choice kind of thing is that a decision made at the border did Trump call that in from the bench how did that get who put that policy out letting you see the older boys not the younger boys and not the girls who told them not to let you see the girls are the younger boys who did that the the shelters are controlled by the Department of Health and Human Services and I actually do want to say those facilities are run by professional competent childcare professionals licensed professionals doctors in those facilities licensed caregivers in those facilities by all accounts Health and Human Services is doing a good job Chris of taking care of these children what has been dumped on their plate by this administration the children coming out of this building is more kids than ever before so there are 11,000 children currently in the care of Health and Human Services today Kristin Nielsen said only about a thousand of those have been separated from their parents but if you extrapolate the rate at which these kids are coming out of this facility and going into that one it'll be twenty thousand by August why don't they want to show us yet where the girls are and where the toddlers are what the toddlers care looks like people are genuinely concerned about these young children and just want to know that they're okay let's let's talk about the heat down there they put these kids into tents what about then by the way side question what are the PR people the public affairs people tell you about the decision to let you see the older boys but not the other children what do they tell you is their excuse for them it's a good question Chris and and and I truly believe they want to get us in these places they have not done it yet they tell us that we'll get you in as soon as we open up one of these places for a tour there's only a couple of them and they're bouncing around the country from one of these to the other Tornillo this tent city I believe will be next on the list for us that we're gonna try to get into that tent city tent camp is really the accurate way to call it where the overflow crowds are being held right now but look if I was them I'd make it a priority because the American people want to know people are contacting me on social media every single day where are the girls where are the toddlers it's something I'm hearing over and over and if I was them if I was sitting behind that desk or if I wasn't going around the country on these site surveys it'd be the first thing I do to open up those facilities to show despite what the Trump administration is doing it's out of control of HHS it's up to the President Trump but despite what he's doing that these kids are well taken care of well they now know everything thanks to your reporting we now know that they're separating kids by age and gender for PR reasons not for humane reasons let me go - let me go to Peter on this one Peter what do you make of the front page the impact here I get this sense that this is one time where Trump has cut down his coalition to a smaller number they may against it be against illegal immigration but not this cutting-edge stuff yeah it's striking that over the weekend you saw a critical mass begin to build a criticism that wasn't just from the left but also from the right obviously Laura Bush the firmament first lady some senators like Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham also the New York Post conservative editorial page and I think that was why you saw so many administration official starting with the President himself out there today trying to push back trying to defend themselves they're on the defensive on immigration which is a position they're not used to being and they're trying to get back on the offense do you think they're going to pull back on this policy of zero tolerance which they basically put into effect without law the law stayed the same they went third direction while they change and give it up now that the heats been on well it's interesting question you know they any any other administration probably would have done that by today just in you know in the natural political course of things that tape you play from ProPublica is obviously very powerful the pictures that have come out of the region are very powerful that a normal political reaction would be to try to make those kind of pictures and audio go away but that's not the way this president generally reacts he doesn't like it to be to be pushed he's using this obviously to push Congress to get legislation that he thinks is necessary to defend the border but if it looks like a cynical ploy that's one more piece of criticism from people even in his own party thank you Peter let me go to Jennifer and there's God's children I open with that because they are God's children every religion believes that kids are kids we get from God they come to us we're responsible for looking out for them they don't decide what country to live in and we have to look out for them when they're here and yet this is Trump's country he keeps winning the PR wars will he win this one I don't think so I think speaking of religions you have really every religious group out there the Catholic Bishops Reform Jews met Franklin great my favorite exactly the big Trump support condemning this and really condemning sessions for trying to spread scripture in defense of this I think Peter and the others are exactly right I think the pictures and the sow are going to know an American's heart and listen Ted Cruz doesn't make compromises on policy issues like immigration for nothing he's doing it because Beatle Rourke who he's running against for Senate went down to the border had film taken of him sitting there with kids talking to the parents and now he's scared so he's now introducing emergency legislation you had Ben Sasse who likes to write a lot of Facebook posts but doesn't very do very much saying that this policy is wicked well he joined some type of policy initiative so I think you're gonna see some movement in Congress and then Trump will try to take credit for it but at this point no one really cares who gets credit for it the Republicans look awful and they should look off I think mothers especially yes absolutely think I've just looked out you don't have to be a genius to see that the women like Laura Bush and Melania Trump are making some noise about this absence for real thank you Kristen Welker with at great reporting and great in the action fighting in there to get the truth in that press room Jacob Soboroff you do this better than anybody that on scene reporting it's the best there
