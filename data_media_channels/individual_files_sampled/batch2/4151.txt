thing one tonight it was over a year three years ago July 2015 at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa when then candidate Donald Trump was asked by the moderator about his claim that John McCain was a dummy Trump Donnelly defended his position he went after McCain for being captured during the Vietnam War he's not a war hero he's a war he's a war hero because he was captured I like people that weren't captured okay I hate to tell you that because he was captured okay I'm sure he's seen that clip before maybe you gasped along with the audience but don't think that was some one-time thing Donald Trump has been slamming John McCain this way for decades the way Trump looks at it he's at least better than everyone else in the race beginning with John McCain a little bit I mean he was captured Senate flew combat in Michigan twice justice being captured make you a hero I don't know I'm not sure 1999 now today as most of Washington was paying their respects and watching the flags go up and down the White House Trump appeared to really want to change the subject badly so he called everyone into the Oval Office where a huge announcement of a brand-new trade deal with Mexico and I believe the president is on the phone Enrique Trump V speakerphone is thing too in 60 seconds in what seemed at least a pretty blatant attempt to change the subject away from John McCain today President Trump tried to rush out an announcement of a proposed trade deal with Mexico and if want for that confounded speakerphone he might have succeeded I believe the president is on the phone Enrique you can hook him up tell me what are we the big thing a lot of people waiting you wonder where to put that on this phone please hello be helpful President Trump thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
