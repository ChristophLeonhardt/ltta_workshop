SANCTIMONIOUS, SENSITIVE, SUPERCILIOUS SNOWFLAKES. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT. STEVE: THERE YOU HAVE GOT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES YESTERDAY LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE. LET'S BRING IN FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR TOMI LAHREN TOMI, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S COMMENTS REGARDING SANCTIMONIOUS SNOWFLAKES ON AMERICA'S CAMPUSES? WELL, HE IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY. I FEEL ABOUT SNOWFLAKES. THIS IS A BIGGER EPIDEMIC NOW OUR HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IT'S NOT JUST THAT KIDS GO TO COLLEGE AND THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY LIBERAL CLASSMATES AND LIBERAL HERE IS THAT CONSERVATIVE AND INDEPENDENT STUDENTS GO I THINK THAT'S THE REAL LIBERAL IDEAS BUT CONSERVATIVE IDEAS THEY DON'T EVEN GET A PLATFORM WITH WHICH TO SPEAK. I THINK THAT'S THE REAL ISSUE WE HAVE ON OUR HANDS. SCHOOLS INCLUDING MIDDLE BERRY COLLEGE AT VERMONT AND BERKELEY SAYING THEY HAVE TRIED TO SEE YOU LENS CONSERVATIVE SPEAKERS. A REPORT THAT THE TOP 45 COLLEGES NO CONSERVATIVE WAS IS THIS GOING TO BACK FIRE OR YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT? LIBERAL CAMPUSES IN THE LONG AS PEOPLE GET SMARTER AND THEY UNDERSTAND THAT OUR FREE SPEECH ZONE IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AT LARGE AND NOT THE ZONES THAT COLLEGE ARBITRARILY PUT IN PLACE. BEYOND THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT COLLEGE CAMPUSES, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT TRUTH HAS BECOME THE NEW HATE SPEECH. IT'S NOT JUST COLLEGE CAMPUSES BUT ALSO IN THE MEDIA. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CONSERVATIVE SPEAKERS, INDEPENDENT SPEAKERS, LIBERTARIAN SPEAKERS TO SHOW UP ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND NOT BE ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE BULL IDEA, HARASSED AND TURNED AWAY. WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO BE LITTLE BIT LOUDER HAVE. TO UTILIZE SOCIAL MEDIA AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE IT MORE OF AN ISSUE. OTHERWISE, COLLEGE CAMPUSES ARE JUST GOING TO BE THE BAGS BASTIONS OF LIBERAL. STEVE: GOT TO GET INVITED PEOPLE ABOUT THAT VERY ISSUE INCLUDING ZAC WOOD WHO WAS JUST ON THIS COUCH. SAID I WAS ON COLLEGE WENT OUT OF THE WAY INVITE CONSERVATIVES. GOT BIG PUSH BACK. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TOOK AN AGGRESSIVE TONE AGAINST THE IRANIAN LEADERS AFTER THEY TRIED TO WE USED TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY. NOT UNDER THIS PRESIDENT. YOU SAY IT SHOWS THE APOLOGY TOUR IS OVER? WELL, ABSOLUTELY. ISN'T IT NICE TO FINALLY HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT LEADS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH? UPSET JUST LAST WEEK BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA NOW OUTRAGED THAT HE WAS TOO STANDARD AT PLAY THERE. BUT, I BELIEVE THAT THIS PRESIDENT, BEING TOUGH ON WORLD LEADERS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAS WORKED. WE SAW IT WORK IN NORTH KOREA. AND I THINK AS SOON AS LIBERALS UNDERSTAND THAT WE DIDN'T ELECT THIS PRESIDENT TO BE NICE, WE ELECTED HIM TO GET THINGS DONE AND HE HAS, MAYBE THEY WILL UNDERSTAND THE STRATEGY AND THEY WILL GET ON BOARD. STEVE: WELL, IT IS A KIND OF STRATEGY IT DOES APPEAR THE KANSAS CITY AT THE VFW CONVENTION, TOMI, SAID THAT IRAN NO LONGER THE SAME COUNTRY IT WAS A WHILE AGO. IS HE READY TO MAKE A DEAL. ADMINISTRATION. BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS READY TO MAKE A DEAL WHEN THEY'RE. WELL, IT REALLY WASN'T MUCH OF A DEAL. IT WAS A CONCESSIONS LIST. THIS PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT AGAIN. THIS PRESIDENT COMES TO THE TABLE AS I SAID FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH. UNLIKE THE LAST ADMINISTRATION WHO TOWERED IN THE CORNER. THAT'S HOW WE GET RESULTS. WE ARE SEEING IT TIME AND LIBERALS CRAZY HOW EFFECTIVE THIS PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE IS HE UNCONVENTIONAL. YES, HE USES TWITTER AS LONG AS IT'S WORKING AND BRINGING PEACE BACK B. IN THE WORLD, THEY SHOULD BE
