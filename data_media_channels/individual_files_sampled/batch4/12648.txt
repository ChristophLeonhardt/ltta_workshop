Joe it's wonderful to see you you're so kind but you forgot to mention I was about 35 weeks pregnant when I said I just knew that's why you were so beautiful I guess well you look great still and it's lovely to see you I always say I never see my friends I only interview them at this point but you look great it improves it improves me tremendously so you're working with live action who's the leader of live action lots right Lila Rose and and it's been a it's got this really interesting way of approaching this but I want to talk to you first about this recent vote in Congress that failed to outlaw abortion after 20 weeks which I keep reminding people is five months now I looked at that failure and I asked myself do they really want to do this and that's what I wouldn't want to know do you think that there's any political will to curtail abortion or stop it I think it's shocking to me how extreme the Democrats are except the three that did vote in in favor of the bill but you know you've gotta Marist Poll just came out that showed three-quarters of Americans actually want to limit abortion to the first trimester so you've got the Democratic Party voting over here and the American public's on the other side of the spectrum and so I think they are so entrenched with the abortion Lobby that they can't see even beyond what's best for them as a party Republicans I think do have the the will to do it not all of them or cows can Collins consistently vote in line with anything that promotes abortion protects Planned Parenthood so we need to see a shake above the Senate before we're going to actually successfully I think jump some of these hurdles but do you think it's possibly you don't think this is just virtually okay I think it's possible because the people are in agreement with restricting abortion and so it's more alerting them to hey your senator your congressman voted actually in a way that's very extreme and outside the norm and against what you believe so if you want to see changes change use in office
