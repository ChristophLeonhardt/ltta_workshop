corporate tax cuts for the wealthy the Republican Party has realized that hey you know we need to do something to increase revenue or at least cut spending to make up for these giant tax cuts it is going to add one point nine trillion dollars to our federal deficit over the next ten years that is what the Trump tax cuts will do and so now all of a sudden you see representatives like Steve strivers speaking very openly to CNBC about what the big plan is moving forward take a look no misgivings about a tax cut that was not paid for that's allowing debt deficit to rise like it is now I do think we need to deal with our some of our spending I think we've got to try to figure out how to spend less entitlements Social Security Medicare we have 10 million people on Social Security disability now more than actually 11 million more than any time in history and some of those people can't work at all but many of those people can't work in the job they used to be in right and if we gave them some training let them keep making a portion of their Social Security disability but put them back to work it would be a net win right so Security Medicare the only way we're gonna be able to fix so scary Medicare is for the two parties to come together the way that you know Ronald Reagan did with Tip O'Neill and figure out how to fix them together okay we told you they'd come for your Social Security and Medicare and they are but they're doing it we're such a friendly setting of a pizza shop that that it's got to be ok they're regular people who are looking to robbed you of all the money that you paid into Social Security and Medicare but they had to find the one point nine trillion dollars for the rich so now that all that money is gone and it's already in their donors pockets all of a sudden well I mean look that's Social Security and Medicare cuz you got rich off of Social Security right or your parents did or your grandparents did no nobody gets rich off of it you pay into it you get it back and it actually works and everybody really likes it so they're out to destroy it this is this is robbery right this is what the Republican Party is doing this is what the Democratic Party as it stands right now will allow to happen because they're not fighters okay they're incredibly weak when it comes to situations like that and I want to emphasize we paid into those programs you look at your paycheck you take a look at what was taken out by the federal government there's SSI Social Security and there's Medicare that money gets taken out of your check because you pay for it so this is robbery they want to cut spending on those programs just so they can keep allowing the wealthy to hoard their wealth it's pathetic and disgusting they're not representing the American people yeah so the reason I was trying to jump in is because I often call them weak but I and we've had this discussion on air before but it's not exactly right they're playing a role the Democrats our Democratic establishment guys it's not the progressives right and their role is to get rolled they're supposed to go all gynaecology you know what bipartisanship is good though and and everybody has a different part in this play and so the part of the mainstream media is to applaud the bipartisanship so later when they say well I mean what can we do there's all these giant deficits well how about when you created a deficit right but the mainstream media will come in and applaud them and go alright Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan from a million years ago remember when Fred phones Flintstone work with Barney Rubble those were the good old days and know right now when they work together they almost always not almost always work for the benefit of their donors and not for us they get paid by the same people so they will come to rob you and look if the establishment emma-crats stand and fight against it great I'd be super happy and I'll give him all the credit in the world but let's keep it real what did Barack Obama promised to do he preemptively offered to the Republicans to cut Social Security he would have done it if the Republicans weren't so stupidly greedy and if the Koch brothers like no we want more and more and more and they got there they're massively right-wing people in the house to tell Boehner no not good enough tell him to cut Social Security more and then at the end of the day they could they couldn't do what they wanted to do all along which is the grand bargain well I'm always talking about how he wanted the grand bargain as part of his legacy the grand bargain was to cut Social Security this is not in dispute he offered it publicly so but now I mean look so the Democrats are the patsies they're the guys who are supposed to roll over in this play but the guy's directing the play yes are the donors would that give to both parties but they give more to the Republicans than the Republicans are the ones who drive it so first of all vote for uncorrupted people but secondly never make the mistake of thing the Republicans are on your side never ever make that mistake unless you're incredibly wealthy then they will rob the average American on your behalf so let's talk about the priorities on you know a Republicans agenda okay priorities include increasing the budget for defense spending so Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman can continue making more money off of perpetual war abroad okay Trump just signed the NDAA for 717 billion dollars he increased spending on that okay defense spending increase at the same time you'll hear Republicans argue no no no the tax cuts are fantastic it's great for the middle and working class because they're gonna create jobs and they're going to pay higher wages but why don't we get into specific numbers right now and see what's happened under these Trump tax cuts so far first off first quarter of 2018 first quarter where these tax cuts actually went into effect the big banks saved how much money in taxes I believe it was 3.4 billion dollars that's how much they saved in taxes so did they increase wages for employees at banks did they create jobs no they didn't in fact wages have not kept up with inflation so if you take inflation into account are have not gone up at all in fact they've gone down slightly look what did they do with the money let's take a look at corporate stock buybacks so stock repurchases hit one hundred ninety billion dollars in the first quarter of 2018 for the SMP 500 these are the best companies that the biggest companies in the country right the last time that record was set was just before the Great Recession when companies bought up almost one hundred seventy two billion dollars in their own stocks or stock buybacks that's what they're doing with their money they're artificially inflating the cost or the value of those shares and then they immediately cash out so for all the people who are watching this who come at me with a ridiculous argument about how this benefits everyone's retirement accounts in their 401ks no no these corporate executives cash out as soon as they count they can because they want to reap the benefits so they're screwing with your future with these massive tax cuts that they've received stock buybacks were one hundred ninety billion dollars and I said but that was in one quarter shaves at times out by four to give you a sense of how much it's gonna be around eight hundred billion dollars for the year did you guys get eight hundred billion dollars you remember when you open up your paycheck you were like whoa look at this money a couple of billion dollars didn't expect that no Paul Ryan bragged about how you might have gotten dollar 50 in your paycheck a dollar 50 versus eight hundred billion okay now I want you to understand it's not just one guy Stivers over there let me go do graphics one and two here Senator Pat Toomey Republican of Pennsylvania we've got entitlement spending that is not sustainable mmm but one point nine trillion owes for the rich was sustainable apparently according to senator Toomey these big spending programs that are growing faster than the economy you can't tax your way out of that problem you've got to make some curbs please what do you mean you can't wait wait wait you text you tax cut it our way into the problem like hey man I can't add taxes on top to get out of the problem but you created the problem you created it to a trillion dollar problem okay so anyone in the media including John Harwood there that doesn't point that out helps the Republicans perpetuate this lie every single time they must ask them what the 1.9 trillion dollars hold that you guys put in the national debt through these tax cuts whether you think they're for the rich or not and by the way they're for the rich and we gave you the overall number you know how much the average person in the top 1% got in tax cuts sixty one thousand dollars a year every year okay did you get sixty one thousand dollars a year from these tax cuts no you didn't because you're not among the rich and one more Senator John Thune of South Dakota of course Republican if we're going to do something about spending in debt we have to get faster growth in the economy which I hope tax reform will achieve has it you know all we did was the stock buybacks inflated the stock market artificially did you go to your wages not at all they have declined liars okay but we have also got to take on making our entitlement programs more sustainable I think there's support generally here for entitlement reform so of course all the Republicans love so-called entitlement reform where they reform the money out of your pocket and into their donors pockets and unfortunately a lot of the Democrats also agree and that is why the system is rigged and by the way if you think that it's going to help your pensions and your 401k Suzanna was pointing out take tick-tick-tick until that bubble burst I'm telling you right now the stock market is going to crash it is gonna crash and another thing I wanted to just quickly mention about these stock buybacks they were illegal they were banned up until the Reagan administration so the Reagan administration decides will allow these corporate buybacks to occur and so this has been an ongoing issue this isn't a partisan issue this isn't me pointing to Republicans and saying it's the Republicans fault although they've definitely had a huge role in making this happen I mean this happened under the Obama administration as well right mystery absolutely so from 2004 to 2014 there was a study done by the Roosevelt Institute and they found out keep in mind this is while restaurant workers are on the streets demanding a living wage and the restaurant industry is saying no we just we can't afford it we just can't afford it at that time okay according to this study by the Roosevelt Institute the restaurant industry spent a hundred forty percent of its profits on buybacks this is just between 2015 to 2017 and why do I say 140 percent because it also takes into account that some of these companies will literally take out debt to buy shares of their own stock to artificially inflate those shares okay and Bill Clinton is the one who deregulated the banks in the first place he did it with Phil Gramm who was a Republican yet another bipartisan compromise that the mainstream media applauded while it absolutely devastated our economy caused a crash in 2008 and it will cause the crash today so one more time let me be absolutely clear this stock market will crash you cannot keep doing stock buybacks and artificially inflate the price of your companies when there is actually no reason why those companies have actually done better in the real world they don't have more profit they don't have more revenue it is an artificial inflation that is called a bubble bubbles always burst this market will crash it's an absolute guarantee but nonetheless we go on as if everything is fine and once they do once the market crashes they'll come back and say oh my but I gotta get paid my bonus what kind of a person will let me get my bonus I have to get more multi-million dollar payouts while you lose all of your 401k never miss another TYT video by ringing the bell below you'll get notified whenever we
