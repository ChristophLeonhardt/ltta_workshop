1
00:00:00,468 --> 00:00:01,168
AINSLEY: SOUNDS GOOD.

2
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,037
ABBY: IT WILL BE 70 AND SUNNY.

3
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:04,605
WHAT A PERFECT DAY.

4
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,340
BRIAN: HE DOES EVERYTHING ROYAL.

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,642
>> HE A KNIGHT OVER THERE.

6
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:09,977
>>> KELLYANNE CONWAY COUNSELOR

7
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:10,978
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP JOINS US FROM

8
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,079
THE NORTH LAWN.

9
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:12,847
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

10
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:13,948
>> GOOD MORNING.

11
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:14,849
STEVE: THE PRESIDENT OF THE

12
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,517
UNITED STATES, I'M SURE YOU SAW

13
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,052
THIS, HE TWEETED FOUR MINUTES

14
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:18,519
AGO.

15
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,387
WOW, WORD SEEMS TO BE COMING OUT

16
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,323
THAT THE OBAMA FBI SPIED ON THE

17
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:24,892
TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED

18
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:25,760
INFORMANT.

19
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,762
ANDREW McCARTHY SAYS THERE IS

20
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,563
NO DOUBT THEY HAD ONE

21
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,598
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT IN THE

22
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:30,965
CAMPAIGN.

23
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:32,600
IF SO THIS IS BIGGER THAN

24
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:32,967
WATERGATE.

25
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,301
HE HAD THIS ONE AS WELL.

26
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:35,569
>> CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA,

27
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,138
WE'RE NOW INTO THE SECOND YEAR

28
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,173
OF THE GREATEST WITCH-HUNT IN

29
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:40,141
AMERICAN HISTORY, THERE IS STILL

30
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:41,942
NO COLLUSION AND NO OBSTRUCTION.

31
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:43,677
THE ONLY COLLUSION DONE BY

32
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,246
DEMOCRATS WHO WERE UNABLE TO WIN

33
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,448
AN ELECTION DESPITE SPENDING FAR

34
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:48,382
MORE MONEY.

35
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,351
WE DON'T NEED TO GET YOUR

36
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,219
REACTION, KELLYANNE, BUT WHAT DO

37
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:52,887
YOU SAY?

38
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,789
>> WE LIKE THE PRESIDENT SAY

39
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:56,891
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS OWN BEST

40
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:57,758
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR.

41
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,760
I OFTEN ENCOURAGE HIM TO INTER

42
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,862
FACE WITH THE PUBLIC DIRECTLY.

43
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,098
I GLAD HE DOES THAT THROUGH HIS

44
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,233
VAST SOCIAL MEDIA REACH AND

45
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:09,970
IT IS DEMOCRATIZATION.

46
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,973
AMERICANS ARE CUTTING OUT THE

47
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,108
MIDDLEMEN.

48
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,110
THE MIDDLEMEN DON'T LIKE IT.

49
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,546
COMMUNICATES WITH THE WORLD AND

50
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:19,280
AMERICANS INSTANTLY ALL AT THE

51
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,914
SAME TIME.

52
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,081
TAKE THE TWO TWEETS TOGETHER.

53
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,349
SEE WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS

54
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,351
THINKING ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE

55
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,519
OF PLAY.

56
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,321
THAT A YEAR PLUS INTO THE

57
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,789
MUELLER INVESTIGATION, WE KNOW A

58
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,759
FEW THINGS, BUT WHAT WE KNOW

59
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,893
CRISPLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY IS

60
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,695
THAT AS THESE REVELATIONS ARE

61
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,430
MAKING THEIR WAY FORWARD, IT

62
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,132
LOOKS LIKE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

63
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,900
MAY IN FACT HAVE BEEN SURVEILED.

64
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,403
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS AN

65
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:43,070
INFORMANT THERE.

66
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,271
WE'LL SEE AS THE PRESIDENT LIKES

67
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,373
TO SAY, WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

68
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,942
WE'LL SEE WHAT THE FACTS MAY

69
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:48,275
REVEAL.

70
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,078
I THINK THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DIG

71
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,213
AND CONJECTURING OVER A YEAR,

72
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:53,948
SHOULD BE CAREFUL WHAT THEY WISH

73
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:54,248
FOR.

74
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,482
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS PERSON

75
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:59,053
WAS HOPING TO GAIN.

76
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,754
MAYBE HE OR SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

77
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,056
LISTENING MORE CAREFULLY WHAT

78
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,458
OUR DIGITAL STRATEGY WAS AND OUR

79
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,161
50% DIGITAL ADS, 50%

80
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,864
CONVENTIONAL TELEVISION RADIO

81
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:10,297
ADS.

82
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,432
MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

83
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,133
LISTENING TO ME SIX OR SEVEN

84
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,602
TIMES A DAY, WHY WE'RE GOING

85
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:15,970
BACK TO PENNSYLVANIA.

86
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,972
WHY THE PRESIDENT WAS HEADED TO

87
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,941
PLACES LIKE WISCONSIN, AND

88
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,110
MICHIGAN AND PLACES HE WON,

89
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,511
REPUBLICANS HADN'T WON IN A VERY

90
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,013
LONG TIME BUT THE PRESIDENT AND

91
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,482
HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN SO

92
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,750
COOPERATIVE WITH THIS

93
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,885
INVESTIGATION.

94
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,052
WE'RE $10 MILLION PLUS INTO IT.

95
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,455
WE'RE OVER A YEAR.

96
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:38,025
EVERYBODY HAS TURNED OVER THE

97
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:38,392
DOCUMENTS.

98
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,760
THEY HAVE BEEN IN TO VISIT THE

99
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,861
SPECIAL COUNSEL.

100
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,429
THEY HAVE BEEN UP ON CAPITOL

101
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,131
HILL SHARING INFORMATION.

102
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:47,001
YOU SEE RELEASE OF TRANSCRIPTS

103
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,969
PEOPLE ARE COOPERATIVE.

104
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,671
THIS PRESIDENT ALSO DOESN'T LET

105
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,506
IT HIM DISTRACT HIM.

106
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,541
I SAT IN THE SENATE REPUBLICAN

107
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,110
LUNCH TWO DAYS AGO, YOU HEARD

108
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,411
SENATOR AFTER SENATOR, TELL THIS

109
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,913
PRESIDENT HE IS THE MOST

110
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,214
SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT IN THEIR

111
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,849
LIFETIMES, IN 16 MONTHS OF TAX

112
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,684
CUTS AND REGULATORY REDUCTIONS

113
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,886
AND GETTING CLOSE TO MAKING,

114
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,254
MAKING CONVERSATIONS IF NOT

115
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,889
DEALS WITH NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH

116
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,025
KOREA, HE HAS BEEN HERE

117
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,293
BASICALLY SEVEN WEEKS SINCE

118
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:15,095
DIRECTOR POMPEO, NOW SECRETARY

119
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,864
OF STATE POMPEO WENT TO

120
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,264
NORTH KOREA.

121
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,300
SEVEN WEEKS OF BIG ACTIVITY, 70

122
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,102
YEARS OF WAR BETWEEN THE KOREAS.

123
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,671
IT'S THIS PRESIDENT LEADERSHIP

124
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,674
HELPS HOSTAGES COME HOME AND

125
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,108
SOME OTHER GREAT THINGS HAPPEN.

126
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,576
BRIAN: COULD EASILY PUNT ON THIS

127
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,045
QUESTION BUT

128
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,079
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" ACTUALLY

129
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,481
SAYS THIS, AT LEAST ONE

130
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,050
GOVERNMENT INFORMANT MET SEVERAL

131
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,754
TIMES WITH PAGE AND

132
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,188
PAPADOPOULOS.

133
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,189
SO SOME GOVERNMENT INFORMANT

134
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,425
WITHIN THE TRUMP CAMP.

135
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,994
COULD YOU TELL ME IF, COULD YOU

136
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,562
JUST TELL ME IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA

137
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,731
OF WHO THAT MIGHT BE?

138
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,199
>> I DON'T HAVE AN IDEA.

139
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,402
LET ME SAY SOMETHING MORE

140
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,972
IMPORTANT THAN KNOWING WHO THE

141
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:59,540
INFORMANT MAY BE.

142
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,241
I DON'T KNOW CARTER PAGE OR

143
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,644
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, IF SOME

144
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,512
SOMEBODY FIND A PICTURE I WAS IN

145
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:09,149
A ROOM WITH GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS,

146
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,484
100 PEOPLE AGAIN I WAS CAMPAIGN

147
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,885
MANAGER FOR WINNING PART OF THE

148
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:12,252
CAMPAIGN.

149
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,621
I SAW CARTER PAGE ON A DIFFERENT

150
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,757
NETWORK TELL THE ANCHOR I NEVER

151
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,858
MET KELLYANNE CONWAY.

152
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,293
I DON'T KNOW THESE TWO PEOPLE.

153
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:23,130
LOOKS LIKE THEY HAD SOME VERY

154
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,831
TANGENTIALAL INVOLVEMENT WITH

155
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,832
THE CAMPAIGN EARLIER ON.

156
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,133
MAYBE THIS HAPPENED THEN BUT I

157
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,534
THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO

158
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,937
NOTE WHICH IS, WHEN THE CAMPAIGN

159
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:33,540
TEAM AND STRUCTURE CHANGED AND

160
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,242
EXPANDED IN AUGUST, DUE TO THE

161
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,044
PRESIDENT MAKING HIS OWN

162
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,512
DECISIONS THEN, I MEAN THE

163
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,415
PRESIDENT OFFERED ME THE

164
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,017
CAMPAIGN MANAGER JOB, TWO OF US

165
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,184
TOGETHER, AUGUST 12th IT,

166
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:44,885
WAS A FRIDAY.

167
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,453
IT WAS ANNOUNCED NEXT WEDNESDAY.

168
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,454
HE HIRED SOMEBODY ELSE IN

169
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,455
BETWEEN THAT.

170
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,857
IF THIS HAPPENED TO HAPPEN

171
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,425
EARLIER ON, IF YOU'RE TALKING

172
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,060
ABOUT PAGE AND PAPADOPOULOS,

173
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,395
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

174
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,096
THIS WHOLE IDEA WE'RE ALL THERE

175
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,132
TOGETHER, YOU SAW WHAT WE WERE

176
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:58,499
DOING.

177
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:01,068
WE WERE OUT EVERY DAY, WE WERE

178
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,636
VERY TRANSPARENT WITH OUR

179
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,003
STRATEGY.

180
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,338
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS DOING SIX OR

181
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:07,374
SEVEN BIG SPEECHES A DAY TOWARD

182
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:07,775
THE END.

183
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,643
YOU KNOW WHERE HE WAS.

184
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,045
ABBY: KELLYANNE, GET YOUR

185
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:12,579
THOUGHTS ON NORTH KOREA.

186
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,314
YOU WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT

187
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:14,748
THAT.

188
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,050
RECENT NEWS OUT NORTH KOREA

189
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,317
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT NOT

190
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,886
COMING TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE

191
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,287
BECAUSE OF JOINT MILITARY

192
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,455
EXERCISE WITH SOUTH KOREA.

193
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:22,489
WHAT WOULD CAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP

194
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,259
TO ULTIMATELY WALK AWAY FROM

195
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,560
THIS THING?

196
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,628
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE IT VERY

197
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,696
CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING, ABBY,

198
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,265
AND HASN'T CHANGED, IF THE

199
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:32,499
CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT, SO FAR

200
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,802
THEY WERE LOOKING GOOD FOR A

201
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,337
WHILE, RELEASE OF THREE

202
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,272
DETAINEES, PEOPLE SHOULD NOT

203
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,607
GLOSS OVER AS CHECK THE BOX

204
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,309
EVENT, THAT WAS AMAZINGLY

205
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,610
TRANSFORMATIVE EVENT, MANY

206
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,579
FRUITS ALREADY OCCURRED OVER THE

207
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,447
PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, BUT THE

208
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,881
PRESIDENT SAID HE CAN EASILY

209
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:48,615
WALK AWAY ALSO.

210
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,716
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

211
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,585
IT IS NOT JUST UP TO PRESIDENT

212
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:51,885
TRUMP.

213
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,854
HE IS READY TO GO ON

214
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,221
JUNE 12th.

215
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:59,560
IT IS UP TO NORTH KOREA AND I

216
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,994
SUPPOSE SOUTH KOREA WHAT YOU'RE

217
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:01,695
DOING TOGETHER.

218
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,263
I SAW THIS MORNING NORTH KOREA

219
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,798
PUT OUT A STATEMENT, THEY HAVE A

220
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:05,966
PROBLEM WITH SOUTH KOREA'S

221
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:06,366
LEADERSHIP.

222
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,068
WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT.

223
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,104
AND THE PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW VERY

224
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,905
MUCH LIKES THE FACT THAT BASED

225
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,775
ON HIS LEADERSHIP THAT AND HIS

226
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:15,476
TEAM, INCLUDING SECRETARY OF

227
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,177
STATE POMPEO GOING OVER THERE

228
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,279
TWO TIMES, THAT NORTH KOREA HAS

229
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,448
ALREADY SUSPENDED SOME OF THEIR

230
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:21,882
EXERCISES.

231
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,218
BUT THIS PRESIDENT MADE VERY

232
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,154
CLEAR, DENUCLEARIZING THE KOREAN

233
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,022
PENINSULA IS IN EVERYBODY'S BEST

234
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:29,389
INTERESTS.

235
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,757
BRIAN: KELLYANNE, I UNDERSTAND

236
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,259
THEY HAVE NOT REACHED FORMALLY

237
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,527
OUT TO YOU GUYS.

238
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,095
NORTH KOREA HAS NOT FORMALLY

239
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,797
REACHED OUT, REGISTERED ANY

240
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,365
COMPLAINTS ABOUT JOHN BOLTON'S

241
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,067
WORDS OR ABOUT MILITARY

242
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:40,434
EXERCISES.

243
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,935
ALL THIS HAS BEEN DONE THROUGH

244
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,070
THE MEDIA.

245
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,339
IS THAT CORRECT?

246
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,207
>> WELL I SAY THIS ABOUT THAT

247
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,343
SINCE I WILL NOT CONFIRM OR DENY

248
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,643
THAT.

249
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,579
I WILL TELL YOU THIS SO MUCH IS

250
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,015
LITIGATED IN MEDIA AND GETS

251
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,417
REPEATED AND RETWEETED WITHOUT

252
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:57,851
VERIFICATION.

253
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,086
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT FAKE NEWS.

254
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,556
I REFER TO IT UNINFORMED

255
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,423
CONJECTURE, SPECULATION.

256
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,259
IT IS DANGEROUS, BECAUSE PEOPLE

257
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,360
THINK SPECULATIVE OPINION,

258
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,395
WISHFUL THINKING, CONCLUSIONS IN

259
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,863
SEARCH OF EVIDENCE SOMEHOW RISE

260
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,900
TO THE LEVEL OF FACTS.

261
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,635
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT

262
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,636
FACTS.

263
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,037
THEY SHOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT

264
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:17,638
THAT.

265
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:20,474
LITIGATING TO THE MEDIA, TALKING

266
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,176
ABOUT SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT AS,

267
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,310
SENSITIVE AS POSSIBLE SUMMIT

268
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,745
BETWEEN NORTH KOREA, SOUTH

269
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:25,579
KOREA, THE UNITED STATES OF

270
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,848
AMERICA BUT THAT IS CONJECTURE.

271
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,417
LOOK, WHAT AMBASSADOR BOLTON HAS

272
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,252
SAID, WHAT SARAH SANDERS HAS

273
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,687
SAID, WE'RE MONITORING THE

274
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,222
SITUATION BUT WE WANT TO VERIFY

275
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,957
WHAT IS FACT AND WHAT IS FICTION

276
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,592
BEFORE WE RUN OUT TO STATE THAT.

277
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,061
I WILL LEAVE THAT TO THE

278
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,095
PRESIDENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY

279
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,564
TEAM IF THERE IS ANNOUNCEMENT TO

280
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,097
BE MADE.

281
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,399
ABBY: YOU SAID EARLIER THIS WEEK

282
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,601
THERE WOULD BE CHANGES IN THE

283
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,469
WHITE HOUSE REGARDING THE LEAKS

284
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,637
CHALLENGES YOU FACED.

285
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,039
WHAT IS THE LATEST, UPDATE ON

286
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,141
THE LEAKING COMING FROM THE

287
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:54,608
WHITE HOUSE?

288
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,176
>> PEOPLE LOOKING LAST WEEK WERE

289
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,045
CLEARLY DOING THAT TO HURT THE

290
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,147
PEOPLE THE TARGETS OF THOSE

291
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:00,447
LEAKS.

292
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,716
THERE IS 99.8% OF THE

293
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,418
INFORMATION WE KNOW, SOME OF US

294
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,520
KNOW IN THIS PLACE THAT NEVER

295
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,454
GETS LEAKED OF THE THERE WERE

296
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,089
BIG LEAKS COMING OUT OF THIS

297
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,758
WHITE HOUSE THE FRUIT OF THE

298
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,227
LEAKS WOULD BE IN THE NEWSPAPER,

299
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,528
NOT PROCESS OF THE LEAKS.

300
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,230
ABBY: DO YOU KNOW HOT LEAKERS

301
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,130
ARE, KELLYANNE?

302
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,498
>> SOMEWHAT.

303
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,634
THEY'RE NOT ALL IN THE PRESS AND

304
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:23,337
COME SHOP AND NOT ALL JUNIOR

305
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:23,637
FOLKS.

306
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,205
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

307
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,440
WORK ON THIS COMPLEX.

308
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,141
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO

309
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,077
THE SENSITIVE INFORMATION.

310
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:32,145
OTHER NON-SENSITIVE,

311
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:32,813
NON-CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

312
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,147
STEVE: KELLYANNE, SOME OF THE

313
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,716
LEAKS ARE AUTHORIZED.

314
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,251
THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO GET

315
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,653
WORD OUT, FLOAT A TRIAL BALLOON

316
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,089
BUT UNAUTHORIZED ONES THAT AS

317
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,789
YOU SAID TRYING TO DESTROY

318
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,492
SOMEBODY, THOSE ARE THE

319
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,660
TROUBLESOME ONES FOR YOU.

320
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,929
>> SMALLER, TIGHTER MEETINGS ARE

321
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:49,630
BETTER IDEA.

322
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,198
TELLING PEOPLE ON NEED TO KNOW

323
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:51,498
BASIS.

324
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,899
THOSE OF US WHO ARE THE PUBLIC

325
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,468
FACES ON BEHALF OF THIS

326
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,036
ADMINISTRATION, MOST OF WHAT WE

327
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,338
ARE, WHAT WE KNOW AND CAN BE

328
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,740
MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE WE DO.

329
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,608
THAT IS THE POINT OF ME STANDING

330
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:02,009
HERE.

331
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:02,709
STEVE: SURE.

332
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,278
>> THAT IS SO MUCH MOST OF WHAT

333
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,979
GOES ON HERE WHAT IS KNOWN TO US

334
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,547
IS NOT KNOWN TO PEOPLE ON THE

335
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,249
OUTSIDE AND I THINK THAT IS

336
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,417
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE

337
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:10,717
ALSO.

338
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,652
THINK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT DID

339
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:12,519
NOT LEAK.

340
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,987
THE FIRST LADY'S PROCEDURE

341
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,322
EARLIER THIS WEEK.

342
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,257
THANK GOD SHE'S FINE.

343
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,226
MR. POMPEO GOING TO NORTH KOREA

344
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,494
OVER EASTER.

345
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,763
THE GUESTS, THE FIRST LADY'S

346
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,197
GUESTS AT STATE OF THE UNION.

347
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,732
THERE WERE MANY NEVER LEAKED.

348
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,601
EIGHT OR 10 OF US KNEW THAT.

349
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,169
THERE ARE AGAIN, YOU HAVE TO

350
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,039
LOOK AT THE ABSENCE OF HARMFUL

351
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,142
LEAKS BUT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE

352
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,244
WHO NOBODY KNOWS WHO THEY ARE

353
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,578
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT, THEY'RE

354
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,980
NOT HOUSEHOLD NAMES PERHAPS,

355
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,848
THEY'RE NOT PUBLIC FACES IN THE

356
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:42,316
ADMINISTRATION.

357
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,717
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION

358
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:44,184
ALSO.

359
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,819
I THINK, BUT TAKING A BROADER

360
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,387
LOOK AT THAT ALSO BUT THE

361
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,922
PRESIDENT ALSO WANTS ME TO MAKE

362
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,191
VERY CLEAR TO ALL OF YOU, THAT

363
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,893
HE KNOWS A LOT OF THIS IS MADE

364
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:53,493
UP ALSO.

365
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,062
THAT SPEAKING OF, IF YOU'RE

366
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:59,599
GOING TO SPECULATE AND BLOVIATE

367
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,600
ABOUT NORTH KOREA AND WHAT MAY

368
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,469
OR MAY NOT BE TRUE YOU ARE

369
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,737
CERTAINLY GOING TO SPECULATE

370
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:04,338
ABOUT LEAKS.

371
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,273
BUT LET ME MAKE VERY CLEAR, MOST

372
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,442
OF THE STORIES THIS WEEK WERE

373
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,710
ABOUT THE PROCESS OF LEAKS, NOT

374
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,111
THE FRUITS OF THOSE LEAKS.

375
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,579
THERE ARE TIGHTER, SMALLER

376
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:12,946
MEETINGS.

377
00:10:12,946 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS VERY HELPFUL TO THIS
