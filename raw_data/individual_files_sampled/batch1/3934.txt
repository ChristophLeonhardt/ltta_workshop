we tried a twelfth thousand dollar flying surfboard and it's a lot easier to ride than you'd think this is an Etoile it has an electric motor attached to a hydrofoil or a thin blade underneath the board with enough speed you can lift up and fly above the water without meeting wind waves paddle or a tow co-founder Nick Leeson said the boards were designed so that everyone can learn to ride the e foil quickly I love water sports so right away I wanted to know if it really was as user-friendly as he said so I went to Isabella Puerto Rico to try it out and turns out he was right Nick took us to crash boat Beach for our first ride it's his favorite spot Annie said he'd have me up on the board in 20 minutes I have a lot of experience paddle boarding and windsurfing but even I thought he was overestimating my ability first we had a safety talk about the functions of the board and how to safely bail if we fell he explained you control your speed using a small handheld remote and you turned by simply leaning or shifting your weight in wonder be sure that there are four main steps to riding the Ã©toile like a pro starting in your stomach to kind of get a feel for the board getting up on your knees standing up and then hydrofoil aim easy enough so we headed out on the water to try it ourselves climbing on the board was no problem at all once you're up it's kind of relaxing I just spent the next couple minutes increasing my speed to get a feel for the board underneath me the first time getting on my knees was a little wobbly but once they were in place I felt totally comfortable straightening my back and I didn't fall so I'm gonna count that as a win full disclosure this was the step when I first wiped out while going at pretty fast speeds you have to pop up into this open stance with one foot forward and one foot back and the first time I did it I totally lost balance but on the second try I got up and stayed up it was probably less than five minutes and I was standing comfortably this was by far the hardest step for me from the standing position in step three I had to shift my feet to the back of the board and with my weight in my back foot the board literally lifted out of the water onto the hydrofoil I know it doesn't look real but I swear there's physics involved and it works and I probably spent the next hour just going up on the hydrofoil and trying to come down as smoothly as possible all from shifting my weight between feet and this is where I had my fair share of face-plants we have a lot of people that have never served before and they're getting up in Hydra foiling on their first battery charge with the oil our II fall is really designed to open up the world of foiling to everybody but for a board that's made for anyone I couldn't quite get over the 12,000 dollar price tag so I set out to find out why it's so pricey well it turns out the production process is pretty much all done by hand using state-of-the-art technology we're talking lithium-ion batteries a carbon fiber hydrofoil an electric motor assembled in the Isabella Factory by a Puerto Rican staff I would say forty to sixty hours probably when you add it all up for each component we're doing about four to five boards a day ship it out which is there's a lot of work involved to put those together a lot of different teams you need to come together pretty soon it'll look like the Jetsons you know with everybody coiling around everywhere having seen how much time goes into each board I totally see why it cost $12,000 but I guess the real question is would it be worth the steep price tag in my opinion absolutely if you have the means Nick was right he can get anyone standing on the e foil in less than 20 minutes it's easy to learn and ridiculously user-friendly and without Sun and cleeshay it's magical up on that hydrofoil once you lift off the water it's silent you're literally flying and I guess you could say that feeling is priceless but sadly I probably won't afford to be up on the e-file again any time soon you
