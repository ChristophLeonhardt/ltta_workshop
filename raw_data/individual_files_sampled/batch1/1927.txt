it is one of the biggest seizures of an opioid drug in US history in the hidden compartment of a truck Nebraska State Police found 53 and a half kilograms of fentanyl worth 20 million dollars on American streets according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency that is potentially enough to kill 26 million people you take that much fentanyl off the street you are saving lives and that's what our Nebraska State Troopers are doing driver Phillipe Geneo Minaya in passenger Nelson Nunez were arrested for drug possession with intent to distribute the opioid epidemic in the u.s. has left police and medical services struggling to cope with the sheer number of overdoses and deaths it's a time bomb it's a prescription for disaster it totally is the potential to kill them if they're not expecting that the US Centers for Disease Control found that most of the drug overdoses in the u.s. are due to fentanyl a drug 30 to 50 times as powerful as heroin I have never seen anything like this in my almost 40 years of working in addiction I believe the that overdose rate will increase I think once drugs like this are in our marketplace if we don't find a way to interrupt that cycle more and more people will use it opioids kill a hundred and 15 Americans every day this police video shows a man near death in Skokie Illinois revived by the drug narcan which many police in the country now carry a few salt sized grains of fentanyl are enough to kill most people when they do overdose the lucky ones end up at places like Stroger Hospital in Chicago but many don't make it at all in terms of the sheer volume it's really the biggest we've had the the rate of rise of fatalities in Cook County has just stepped up up up in 2015 we had about 665 fatalities the next year we had 1100 and for the past year we're collecting the statistics on it looks like it'll be at least at that level maybe a little bit higher US police say the strength of fentanyl they're recovering from black-market drug dealers is more powerful than ever meaning its victims could in time be counted in the millions john Hendren al-jazeera Chicago
