00:02:09,398 --> 00:02:10,031
IN OTHER WORDS, IT’S LIKE FLIPPING THE COIN.

72
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:12,233
FLIPPING THE COIN. I FLIP A COIN, IT’S HEADS, I WIN

POWERFUL THAN THE RUDDER ON A BIG SHIP.

91
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:44,666
BIG SHIP. WE USE OUR TONGUE AS A WEAPON.

THIS DOMESTIC CONTENT, WE DON’T KNOW HOW THAT WILL WORK.

207
00:05:33,904 --> 00:05:35,338

IT IS POSSIBLE, STEPHANIE THAT SOMEBODY WILL WANT TO PRODUCE

209

SOMEBODY WILL WANT TO PRODUCE SOME OF WHAT THEY’RE MAKING IN

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,044
SOME OF WHAT THEY’RE MAKING IN NORTH AMERICA IN EUROPE.

211
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:42,946
NORTH AMERICA IN EUROPE. BECAUSE THEY CAN’T MEET ALL THE

216
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,652
OVERALL, IT’S NOT REALLY A BIG CHANGE.

217
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:51,120
CHANGE. BUT AT LEAST IT’S DONE.

218
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:52,655
BUT AT LEAST IT’S DONE. HERE’S THE QUESTION.

219
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,390
HERE’S THE QUESTION. AT WHAT COST -- YOU THINK --

AND DONALD TRUMP DID HIS CALCULATION, HE PROBABLY SAID,

226
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:06,969
CALCULATION, HE PROBABLY SAID, THEY’RE CANADIAN.

227
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:08,571
THEY’RE CANADIAN. >> IF WE WANT TO RALLY THE WORLD

AGAINST THE ILLEGITIMATE PRACTICES OF CHINA, YOU DON’T DO

230
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,878
PRACTICES OF CHINA, YOU DON’T DO IT BY ANGERING SOMEBODY OR

231
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,079
IT BY ANGERING SOMEBODY OR PUTTING THEM IN A CORNER OR

00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:22,318
AND HE WON ON THAT. >> WELL, DID HE WIN LONG TERM?

236
00:06:22,353 --> 00:06:23,553
>> WELL, DID HE WIN LONG TERM? DOES AMERICA WIN LONG TERM ON

237
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:23,853
DOES AMERICA WIN LONG TERM ON THIS?

238
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:25,254
THIS? I MEAN, IN THE SHORT TERM, YOU

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,259
LOOK, I’M GLAD THEY GOT THIS DONE.

242
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,161
DONE. BUT THERE’S NO DRAMATIC,

00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:32,562
BUT THERE’S NO DRAMATIC, COMPLETELY DRAMATIC THINGS IN

00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:42,072
IF THERE IS SUCH A THING, ISN’T THIS AN EXAMPLE OF THE GENIUS OF

250
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:42,372
THIS AN EXAMPLE OF THE GENIUS OF TRUMP?

251
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:43,707
TRUMP? MAX BOOT PUT IT OUT THERE WHERE

252
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,008
MAX BOOT PUT IT OUT THERE WHERE HE SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP’S

253
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,977
HE SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP’S SPECIALTY IS TO CREATE A CRISIS

254

SO TO PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BASE WHERE HE SAID TEAR NAFTA UP,

258
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:53,417
WHERE HE SAID TEAR NAFTA UP, IT’S THE WORST THING.

259
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:54,918
IT’S THE WORST THING. HE TORE IT UP IN NAME.

HE TORE IT UP IN NAME. WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT IS, A

261
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:58,989
WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT IS, A GLOBALIST SORT OF HAPPY MEDIUM.

262
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,625
GLOBALIST SORT OF HAPPY MEDIUM. >> POLITICS IS ABOUT PEOPLE.

IT’S HARD TO GET THEM TO COME BACK AND TO WORK WITH YOU ON A

267

DAMAGING RELATIONSHIPS. IT’S NOT COMPLICATED.

288
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:51,275
IT’S NOT COMPLICATED. THAT DOESN’T MEAN WE DON’T NEED

THAT DOESN’T MEAN WE DON’T NEED TO FIGHT.

BETTER TRADE AGREEMENT WITH EUROPE.

293
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:57,381

323
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:44,094
WHAT DO WE WANT OUR LEGACY TO BE?

324
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:46,731
BE? THAT WE SACRIFICE ALL OF OUR

325
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:48,366
THAT WE SACRIFICE ALL OF OUR VALUES AND VALUE SYSTEM FOR MORE

VALUES AND VALUE SYSTEM FOR MORE PROFIT?

327
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:49,534
PROFIT? I MEAN, COME ON.

00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:01,246
BUSINESS. THEY’RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

335
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:03,248
THEY’RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. WHEN THEY BECOME MUTUALLY

336
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:05,784
WHEN THEY BECOME MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, THAT’S WHEN COMPANIES

337
00:09:05,818 --> 00:09:07,952
EXCLUSIVE, THAT’S WHEN COMPANIES ARE NOT AT THEIR BEST AND

338
00:09:07,953 --> 00:09:09,754
ARE NOT AT THEIR BEST AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE MORALLY

339
00:09:09,788 --> 00:09:10,121
SOMETIMES THEY ARE MORALLY BANKRUPT.

00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:29,407
BECAUSE THEY’RE ANGRY, OKAY. WE’RE BACK AGAIN TO THE ZERO SUM

350
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:29,741
WE’RE BACK AGAIN TO THE ZERO SUM GAME.

00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:37,615
I MEAN, COME ON, FOLKS. YOU DON’T TEACH YOUR KIDS TO BE

00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:37,983
YOU DON’T TEACH YOUR KIDS TO BE THAT WAY.

355
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:39,784
THAT WAY. SO WHEN THE PUBLIC ITSELF SAYS I

356
00:09:39,786 --> 00:09:42,086
SO WHEN THE PUBLIC ITSELF SAYS I WIN, YOU LOSE, I’VE GOT FRIENDS

357
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:44,122
WIN, YOU LOSE, I’VE GOT FRIENDS THAT WERE IN A BARBER SHOP LAST

358
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:44,456
THAT WERE IN A BARBER SHOP LAST WEEK.

IT WAS HORRIBLE, OKAY. WHERE DOES THIS COME FROM?

366
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:57,402
WHERE DOES THIS COME FROM? WHEN WE SAY BLAME THE

367
00:09:57,437 --> 00:09:58,904
WHEN WE SAY BLAME THE POLITICIANS, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

368
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:00,505
POLITICIANS, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OURSELVES TOO AND SAY WE CAN BE

369
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:01,439

ARGUMENT. I COULD LOSE A COUPLE, OKAY.

377
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:15,520
I COULD LOSE A COUPLE, OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT, MY LIFE IS BETTER
