hate pain<font color="#E5E5E5"> tolls but the Illinois told</font>

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,590
people are always like the friendliest

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,559
people around like I've got imagined

12
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,770
that job sucks but they are always the

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,090
nicest people so good<font color="#CCCCCC"> job Illinois</font>

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,460
me and I should probably go this isn't

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,700
safe

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,140
now that I am out of imminent danger

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,500
I am time to Chicago about a two and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,480
half three hour drive from<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I live</font>

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,850
I ain't driving<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said before in</font>

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,809
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel so like whenever i am going</font>

21
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:03,230
somewhere

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,340
not close with anybody I do not drive

23
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,539
today I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going alone</font>

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,530
be like sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a car and just like</font>

25
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,060
waiting to be somewhere

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">no how you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys keep yourself</font>

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,100
entertained on like road trips or long

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,950
car rides I haven't listened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to podcasts</font>

29
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,580
I burned six of them

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,080
two CDs to get

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,310
through this ride I got

32
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,870
roaming pod to catch up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and cereal</font>

33
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,610
this very compliant which is like

34
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,400
intrigued about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a murder so that kind of</font>

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,440
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time go a lot faster for me</font>

36
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,680
even listening

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,400
but still a high important and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">driving so what do you do or like what</font>

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,400
podcasting listen to as I could probably

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,240
stay

41
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,330
to get more going

42
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,150
otherwise the other thing that I do if I

43
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,090
have to go somewhere is take the train

44
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,600
or a bus or something I used to always

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,700
take the bus from a distance walk or

46
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,800
take the train from walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Chicago</font>

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,440
that is just so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> better because even</font>

48
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,150
though you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I mean you</font>

49
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,150
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay for gas and and you</font>

50
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,080
like we get work done at a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

51
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,930
stop I wrote so many papers on the bus

52
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,860
but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no good train from Chicago</font>

53
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,470
to Madison which is like unacceptable

54
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,270
there should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be no reason no reason</font>

55
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,950
there's a bus but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it only runs like a</font>

56
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,630
few times<font color="#E5E5E5"> a day so I'd have to leave it</font>

57
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,720
like nine morning and then get home at

58
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,920
like nine at night which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

59
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,710
happening so public transports really

60
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,840
the way to go I think it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wave of</font>

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,280
the future there should be trains

62
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,490
running everywhere I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why we</font>

63
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,830
all put up with this car<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

64
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,590
so I'm heading back from Chicago I just

65
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,890
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> done getting some head shots taken</font>

66
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,430
and that I went shopping at of papers to

67
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,120
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we don't have it Madison</font>

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,310
now traffic is like just kind of picking

69
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,269
up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will be driving for another like</font>

70
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:17,379
two and a half

71
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,520
