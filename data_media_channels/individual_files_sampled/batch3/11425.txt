Donald Trump not known for his modesty never stops bragging about the fact that he wrote the art of the deal seems that when it comes to his role as commander-in-chief he sees himself is almost the great negotiator and when it comes to North Korea you could argue that his approach kind of worked he is a sick puppy Rocketman is on a suicide mission for himself that's not make anymore threats to the United States they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen since taking office Donald Trump has played up the so-called threat of another geopolitical rival of America threat posed by Iran whose chief exports are violence bloodshed and chaos all nations of conscience must work together to isolate her for a minute it started to look like things were cooling off and maybe talks were on the table I believe in meeting I would certainly meet with Iran if they wanted to meet him ready to meet anytime they want to but Iran's supreme leader wasn't having it letti there will be no war nor will we negotiate with the u.s. it is impossible but even if some day the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran were to negotiate with the u.s. regime it would never negotiate with the current government of the US and then there's Turkey and its detention of pastor Andrew Bronson who turkish authorities say was tied to the 2016 coup attempt now Trump says he wants him released the United States will impose large sanctions on Turkey for their longtime detainment of pastor Andrew Brunson this innocent man of faith should be released immediately I have just authorized a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminium with respect to Turkey as their currency the Turkish Liras slides rapidly downward against a very strong dollar our relations with Turkey are not good at this time but turkey isn't gonna budge and just like Trump Erewhon knows how to talk tough our biologists we are partners in native and then you stop your strategic partner in the back we will do as the law dictates you cannot simply make turkey bow down by bossing us around meanwhile Russia is not exactly caving in the face of sanctions yes Louis little stupid opener if Sam ban on banks operations or under use of one or another currency polish it would be possible to clearly call it a declaration of economic war and it would be necessary to react to this war economically politically or if indeed by other means in our American friends need to understand this let's remember that those sanctions on North Korea were not unilateral they were actually imposed by the United Nations but when it comes to the rest of the world Trump is on his own and it seems that his reputation as a great negotiator is on the rocks caleb Maupin RT washington DC you
