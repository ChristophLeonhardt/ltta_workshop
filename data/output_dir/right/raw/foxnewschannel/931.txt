1
00:00:00,777 --> 00:00:01,944
CHRISTOPHER WRAY.

2
00:00:01,944 --> 00:00:04,213
IN RESPONSE TO THIS GAPING

3
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:04,981
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR

4
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:05,448
GENERAL REPORTS.

5
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:07,450
WILL BRING IT TO YOU WHEN IT

6
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,183
HAPPENS.

7
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:10,620
AMONG THE MANY NEW REVELATIONS,

8
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,889
THE IG REPORT BLASTS FORMER FBI

9
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:14,290
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY FOR HOW HE

10
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,458
HANDLED THE HILLARY CLINTON

11
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,094
EMAIL PROBE, SAYING HE BROKE

12
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:18,461
PROTOCOL.

13
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:20,063
THE WHITE HOUSE IS RESPONDING TO

14
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:21,531
STUNNING DEVELOPMENTS.

15
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:24,767
>> THE PRESIDENT WAS BRIEFED ON

16
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:26,469
THE IG REPORT EARLIER TODAY AND

17
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:29,572
IT REAFFIRMS THE PRESIDENTS

18
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:30,506
SUSPICIONS ABOUT COMEY'S CONDUCT

19
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:31,607
AND THE POLITICAL BIAS AMONG

20
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:34,410
SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE FBI.

21
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,112
>> Jesse: "SPECIAL REPORT"

22
00:00:36,112 --> 00:00:39,215
ANCHOR BRET BAIER.

23
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:40,116
I'M SURE YOU HAVE NOT READ THE

24
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:42,385
ENTIRE THING.

25
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:44,987
>> Bret: DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY

26
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:46,189
TREES WE'VE KILLED?

27
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:47,623
WE ARE ALL PRINTING IT.

28
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:52,161
>> Dana: AND I'M SURE YOU ALL

29
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:52,995
ARE READING IT.

30
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:55,198
>> Jesse: WHAT JUMPS OUT AT

31
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:56,566
YOU SO FAR?

32
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:58,468
>> Bret: THE BIG LOSER: JAMES

33
00:00:58,468 --> 00:00:58,768
COMEY.

34
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:01,170
THIS IG REALLY GOES AFTER THE

35
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,005
FORMER FBI DIRECTOR FOR HIS

36
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:04,373
DECISION-MAKING.

37
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:06,175
TWO, THE OTHER LOSER, PETER

38
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:08,444
STRZOK AND LISA PAGE AND THOSE

39
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,580
TEXT MESSAGES THAT SURFACED,

40
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,215
MORE OF THEM, AND THIS REPORT.

41
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:16,953
THE BIGGEST OF WHICH WILL BE I'M

42
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:21,157
SURE GRASPED UPON BY

43
00:01:21,157 --> 00:01:21,991
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS

44
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:22,625
SUPPORTERS.

45
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,494
SEVEN WORDS IN ANSWER TO ATTACKS

46
00:01:24,494 --> 00:01:26,195
FROM LISA PAGE TO PETER STRZOK.

47
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:28,998
"TRUMP IS NEVER GOING TO BECOME

48
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:33,503
PRESIDENT, RIGHT, RIGHT?

49
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,772
WE WILL STOP IT.

50
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:36,839
THAT, IN AND OF ITSELF EVEN

51
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:38,508
THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE THE FULL

52
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:41,844
CONTEXT, JUST THAT IN A VACUUM

53
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:45,982
WILL CREATE MAJOR FUEL TO THE

54
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:46,649
ISSUE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING

55
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,752
BEHIND THE SCENES.

56
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:53,589
THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS THAT

57
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:55,591
OVERALL, THE IG SAYS THEY

58
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,160
COULDN'T DOCUMENT POLITICAL BIAS

59
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,761
WITHIN THE FBI ON THE DECISIONS

60
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:01,330
MADE EARLY IN THE CLINTON EMAIL

61
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,899
CASE.

62
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:06,235
AND DOES RAISE QUESTIONS,

63
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,770
FIND AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THE

64
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,574
CASE AFTER JULY, WHEN THE FBI

65
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:13,776
DIRECTOR COMEY COMES OUT WITH

66
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:14,777
THE NEWS STATEMENT.

67
00:02:14,777 --> 00:02:15,978
>> Jesse: SEEMS LIKE THE

68
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:18,915
REPORT TEASED UP THE NEXT IG

69
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:20,449
REPORT ABOUT THE RUSSIA

70
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,285
INVESTIGATION, ESPECIALLY OFF

71
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:26,989
THE NEW PAGE-STRZOK TEXTS.

72
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:27,523
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE.

73
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,425
>> Kimberly: I THINK THERE WAS

74
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:30,193
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING THERE'S

75
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:34,564
MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE IN

76
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:35,198
HERE.

77
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:35,998
OBVIOUSLY QUITE VOLUMINOUS.

78
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:38,201
BUT IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF

79
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,268
DISCUSSION THAT PRECEDED THIS,

80
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:41,003
DO YOU THINK THEY TAKE AWAY,

81
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:42,205
WHAT YOU ARE HEARING FROM BEHIND

82
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,974
THE SCENES, IS THAT THIS WAS

83
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:46,175
SOMETHING THAT THEY OVERPROMISE,

84
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:48,010
AND ARE DELIVERED.

85
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,111
HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE IT?

86
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:50,813
>> Bret: FIRST OF ALL,

87
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:52,348
DEPENDING ON YOUR POLITICAL

88
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:53,983
POINT OF VIEW, JUST TALKING PURE

89
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:55,251
POLITICS, YOU LOOK AT THIS AND

90
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:57,420
THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO SAY

91
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,287
IT'S A NOTHING BURGER AND OTHER

92
00:02:58,287 --> 00:02:59,956
PEOPLE WILL SAY IT IS CHOCK-FULL

93
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:03,693
OF DAMNING THINGS.

94
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:05,561
I THINK WHAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM

95
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,763
CHRIS WRAY IS THAT THIS IS A BIG

96
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:08,965
PROBLEM WITHIN THE FBI.

97
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:10,233
THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO

98
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,934
ANNOUNCE SOME KIND OF ACTION

99
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:12,835
THEY ARE TAKING.

100
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:13,536
IF YOU LOOK AT TREY GOWDY AND

101
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,039
WHAT HE PUT OUT IN THE STATEMENT

102
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,609
HE PUT OUT, HE SAYS HE IS

103
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:20,776
ALARMED, ANGERED, AND DEEPLY

104
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:22,778
DISAPPOINTED AND GOES ON TO

105
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:24,513
DETAIL AND PRETTY SCATHING TERMS

106
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:25,181
WHAT HE SEES.

107
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:28,017
HE IS A GUY WHO HAS DEFENDED THE

108
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:29,518
FBI, EVEN THE MOST RECENT

109
00:03:29,518 --> 00:03:31,988
SPYGATE STUFF.

110
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:33,422
>> Jesse: JUAN WILLIAMS TOOK A

111
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,590
REALLY GOOD DATA TAKEOFF.

112
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,893
WE HAVE MARIE HARF IN HIS PLACE.

113
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:38,628
MARIE, TO GET AWAY.

114
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:43,766
>> Marie: JIM COMEY RESPONDED

115
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,167
WHERE HE ENDORSED THE IG'S

116
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:47,069
EFFORTS BUT DISAGREE WITH SOME

117
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:47,970
OF THE FINDINGS.

118
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,372
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS NEXT FOR

119
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:49,972
JIM COMEY?

120
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:52,842
DOES HE KEEP SPEAKING OUT?

121
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:55,378
DOES HE KEEP QUIET?

122
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:56,779
IS HE INVESTIGATED FURTHER?

123
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,414
>> Bret: I BET HE GOES INTO

124
00:03:58,414 --> 00:03:58,814
THE NIGHT.

125
00:03:58,814 --> 00:03:59,615
IT'S INTERESTING HE'S OUT OF THE

126
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:00,883
COUNTRY AT THE TIME THAT THE IG

127
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:03,986
REPORT IS COMING OUT.

128
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,788
HE OBVIOUSLY MADE HIS ROUNDS ON

129
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:06,722
THE MEDIA, INCLUDING

130
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:07,356
"SPECIAL REPORT."

131
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:09,625
HE DID THE BOOK TOUR, LAID THE

132
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,160
GROUNDWORK FOR HIS DEFENSE AND

133
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,629
OBVIOUSLY HAS THIS LETTER TO

134
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,630
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" ."

135
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,132
BUT THE STUFF IN HERE SUGGESTS

136
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:18,733
THAT HE MADE SOME BIG MISTAKES

137
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:19,802
IN THE EYES OF THE

138
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,671
INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE JUSTICE

139
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:22,405
DEPARTMENT.

140
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:24,774
NO MATTER IF YOU LOOK AT FROM A

141
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:26,575
CLINTON PERSPECTIVE, THAT THERE

142
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:28,377
ARE FOLKS HE THINK HE COST

143
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:30,112
HILLARY CLINTON OF THE ELECTION,

144
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:31,414
OR A TRUMP PERSPECTIVE AND HOW

145
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:32,148
HE DEALT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP

146
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:34,450
AFTER THE ELECTION.

147
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,384
>> Jesse: HE TOOK IT ON THE

148
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:35,818
CHAIN.

149
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,453
THEY SAID HE COMMITTED SERIOUS

150
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:41,357
VIOLATIONS OF FBI POLICY AND

151
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:43,960
PROCESS AND DAMAGE THE

152
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,627
CREDIBILITY OF THE

153
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:46,162
INVESTIGATION, ANY INSTITUTION

154
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:46,495
ITSELF.

155
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,598
TOUGH STUFF COMING OUT OF THE IG

156
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:49,932
REPORT.

157
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:51,500
>> Dana: BRET, IN JIM COMEY'S

158
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,869
STATEMENT, IN REACTION TO THIS,

159
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:55,571
FIRST A TWEET AND THEN AN OP-ED

160
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:56,605
IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES," HE SAYS

161
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:57,440
I RESPECT THE IG.

162
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,976
I THINK THEY DID GREAT WORK

163
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:00,309
HERE.

164
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:01,210
REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE.

165
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,980
HE IS MOVING ON.

166
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,315
NOW THE STRZOK ATTORNEY PUT OUT

167
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:07,383
A STATEMENT BUT HE DIDN'T

168
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:09,018
ADDRESS THE TEXT MESSAGES.

169
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,386
I'M CURIOUS IF YOU THINK THAT

170
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:12,455
MIGHT HAPPEN AND THEN MY OTHER

171
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:14,824
QUESTION IS MICHAEL HOROWITZ,

172
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:15,691
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, HAD A LOT

173
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,093
OF BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FROM A LOT

174
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:22,064
OF CREDIBILITY ACROSS

175
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:28,904
ADMINISTRATIONS.

176
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:29,538
RADCLIFFE SAID HE READ THE

177
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,306
REPORT, HAS BEEN BRIEFED, AND HE

178
00:05:30,306 --> 00:05:30,873
MAINTAINS CONFIDENCE.

179
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:31,774
MICHAEL HOROWITZ, I GUESS THIS

180
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:32,641
NEXT IG REPORT ON THE CLINTON

181
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:36,012
EMAILS THEMSELVES AND THAT

182
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:37,613
INVESTIGATION WOULD HAVE SOME

183
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:38,014
CREDIBILITY.

184
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:39,648
>> Bret: YEAH, AND THESE ARE

185
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:41,417
QUESTIONS I'M GOING TO ASK

186
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:42,251
CHAIRMAN GOWDY AND GOODLATTE AND

187
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:44,587
THEY WILL BE ON THE NEXT HOUR ON

188
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:45,221
"SPECIAL REPORT," I THINK

189
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:49,291
THERE'S A LOT HERE THAT TEES UP

190
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:55,364
THE NEXT ITERATION OF THE IG'S

191
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:56,365
EFFORT.

192
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:58,601
THE SECOND TEXT, NO, NO, HE

193
00:05:58,601 --> 00:05:59,135
WON'T BE PRESIDENT.

194
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:00,102
WE WILL STOP IT.

195
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:05,474
THAT WAS RELEASED IN THE LAST

196
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:06,409
FEW DAYS.

197
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,411
THE FIRST PART WAS RELEASED BY

198
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,012
THE SECOND PART WAS NOT.

199
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:12,181
IT TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT

200
00:06:12,181 --> 00:06:13,049
TRANSPARENCY AND WHERE THIS

201
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:15,351
DOCUMENT BACK AND FORTH IS GOING

202
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:23,692
WITH CAPITOL HILL AND OVERSIGHT.

203
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:24,427
TO YOUR POINT, PEOPLE WILL LOOK

204
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:25,061
AT THIS AND THERE WILL BE

205
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:25,795
REPUBLICANS WILL LOOK AT IT AND

206
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:26,228
SAY HE DIDN'T.

207
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:27,163
OTHERS WILL LOOK AT IT AND SAY

208
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:30,199
THERE IS A LOT IN HERE YET TO BE

209
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,801
MINED.

210
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:35,404
>> Jesse: FROM "THE FIVE"'S

211
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:36,138
INSPECTOR GENERAL, GREG GUTFELD.

212
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:37,273
>> Greg: THIS IS BLOWING MY

213
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:37,573
MIND.

214
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:40,176
I HEARD A RUMOR THAT THE FBI'S

215
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:47,583
GOING TO CHANGE THEIR NAME TO

216
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,552
FWB?

217
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:51,987
>> Bret: THERE IS A SECTION

218
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:53,556
THAT DEALS WITH THAT.

219
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:57,026
TICKETS, INVITATIONS.

220
00:06:57,026 --> 00:06:58,494
>> Greg: I HAVE A SERIOUS

221
00:06:58,494 --> 00:06:59,762
QUESTION.

222
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:03,766
WE FOUND OUT THAT COMEY USED HIS

223
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,367
PRIVATE EMAIL TO CONDUCT

224
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:06,469
NONCLASSIFIED BUSINESS WHICH IS

225
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:10,806
MAYBE WHY HE COULDN'T DAMN

226
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,007
HILLARY FOR DOING THE SAME

227
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:12,308
THING.

228
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:13,576
EVERYBODY IS GUILTY OF DOING THE

229
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:13,976
SAME THING.

230
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,112
COULD THAT BE PART OF THE REASON

231
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:18,114
WHY HE DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED

232
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:18,447
FURTHER?

233
00:07:18,447 --> 00:07:20,783
>> Bret: YOU ARE TRYING TO BE

234
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:21,183
FUNNY --

235
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:22,618
>> Greg: I AM SERIOUS.

236
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:23,819
>> Bret: THESE ARE GOOD

237
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,987
NUGGETS OF THE REPORT THAT HAD

238
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,189
NOT BEEN PUT OUT THERE.

239
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:29,825
COMEY IS USING A PRIVATE EMAIL,

240
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,594
EVEN THOUGH IT'S UNCLASSIFIED,

241
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:32,761
TO DEAL WITH THE EMAIL

242
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:34,597
INVESTIGATION OF HILLARY CLINTON

243
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:35,798
INVESTIGATION OF HILLARY CLINTO

244
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:36,265
HILLARY CLINTON.

245
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:38,134
THE IG SAYS THAT'S NOT A GOOD

246
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:38,634
THING.

247
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:40,269
I HAVE THE GUTFELD DIARIES OVER

248
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:42,404
HERE, LOOKING FOR THEM.

249
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:44,039
>> Kimberly: FRIGHTENING.

250
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,309
>> Greg: YOU ON PAGE 70.

251
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:48,978
>> Jesse: YOU DO NOT WANT TO

252
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,713
BE ON GUTFELD'S DIARY.

253
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:52,381
NICE JOB OF THE DAY WITH THE

254
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:53,382
INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT.

255
00:07:53,382 --> 00:07:55,784
WE WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO

256
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:57,820
6:00 P.M. FOR ANOTHER GREAT

257
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,320
"SPECIAL REPORT."

258
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,022
KIMBERLY, IT'S LIKE WE TALKED

259
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,790
ABOUT THESE NUGGETS COMING OUT.

260
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,558
IT'S GOING TO TAKE PROBABLY

261
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:06,595
ANOTHER 24 HOURS TO GET ALL OF

262
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:07,696
THEM, HER EMAILS WERE PENETRATED

263
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,200
BY A FOREIGN AGENT.

264
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,068
THAT, WE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW

265
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:14,236
BECAUSE COMEY HIMSELF SAID IT

266
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:15,871
WAS POSSIBLE THAT HAPPENED IN

267
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,007
THAT WE LEARNED THAT IT ACTUALLY

268
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:19,842
DID HAPPEN.

269
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:21,177
ONE OF THOSE EMAILS WAS

270
00:08:21,177 --> 00:08:23,579
CONSIDERED SECRET, WHICH MEANS

271
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:24,180
DISCLOSURE OF THAT EMAIL

272
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,448
REASONABLY COULD BE EXPECTED TO

273
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:28,017
CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE

274
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:29,885
NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE

275
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:30,319
UNITED STATES.

276
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,020
>> Kimberly: I THINK THIS IS

277
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,022
SIGNIFICANT, MUCH WAS MADE AT

278
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:35,591
THE TIME, POSSIBLE BUT THERE WAS

279
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:37,193
NO NAILING IT DOWN.

280
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:38,027
OBVIOUSLY THEY KNEW AND WERE NOT

281
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:41,197
HONEST ABOUT IT.

282
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:42,231
ESSENTIALLY I CALL IT A

283
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:42,597
COVER-UP.

284
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:44,700
IF YOU KNEW THEY HAD BEEN

285
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,403
PENETRATED AND HAD BEEN READ, BY

286
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,138
OR ACCESSED BY A FOREIGN AGENT,

287
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:52,775
THAT'S SIGNIFICANT.

288
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:54,410
IT'S A SECURITY BREACH OF THE

289
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,978
HIGHEST ORDER AND IS VERY

290
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:57,413
DISCONCERTING FOR US FOR

291
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,380
NATIONAL SECURITY.

292
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,215
BUT THERE YOU GO.

293
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:04,019
HILLARY CLINTON, THE RULES OF

294
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,822
LOG DO NOT APPLY TO HER OR

295
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:07,189
MR. COMEY.

296
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:10,192
BIRDS OF A FEATHER.

297
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:12,394
>> Jesse: MARIE, SOME OF THE

298
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:14,863
NUGGETS I AM INTERESTED IN DEAL

299
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:15,798
WITH STRZOK.

300
00:09:15,798 --> 00:09:16,899
THEY KEEP COMING.

301
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,802
"WE WILL STOP IT," MEANING WE

302
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:21,604
WILL STOP THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY.

303
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,339
COMPARE THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT

304
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,240
THE COUNTRY FROM DONALD TRUMP

305
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,141
AND WE NEED AN INSURANCE POLICY

306
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:28,811
IN CASE HE'S ELECTED AND NOW FBI

307
00:09:28,811 --> 00:09:31,113
AGENTS ARE CALLING TRUMP

308
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:35,184
SUPPORTERS RETARDED.

309
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:38,020
THEY ARE EXCHANGING ANTI-TRUMP,

310
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,787
PRO-HILLARY TEXT MESSAGES.

311
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:39,922
THE IG SAYS THERE WAS

312
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:42,224
WILLINGNESS TO TAKE OFFICIAL

313
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:46,295
ACTION TO IMPACT TRUMP'S

314
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:56,972
ELECTORAL PROCESS         PROSPC

315
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:57,006
ELECTORAL PROCESS         PROSPS

316
00:09:57,006 --> 00:09:57,239
ELECTORAL PROCESS         PROSP.

317
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:57,606
FOR THAT

318
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:58,040
SEEM SERIOUS.

319
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,607
>> Marie: I THINK THEY

320
00:09:58,607 --> 00:09:59,275
DEMONSTRATED INCREDIBLY BAD

321
00:09:59,275 --> 00:09:59,642
JUDGMENT.

322
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:00,309
BUT THEY ALSO FOUND THAT NO

323
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:00,943
EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL BIAS

324
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:01,577
AFFECTED THE HILLARY EMAIL

325
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:02,011
INVESTIGATION.

326
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:02,678
THESE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE

327
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:03,145
BEEN DOING THIS.

328
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:03,912
IT WAS STUPID AND IT LOOKS BAD

329
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:06,615
ON THE IG FOUND THAT, IT LOOKS

330
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,384
BAD, CALLED INTO QUESTION THE

331
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:10,586
INVESTIGATION IMPARTIALITY.

332
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:12,221
BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THEIR

333
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:12,821
PERSONAL VIEWS IMPACTED.

334
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,156
>> Jesse: THEY ARE NOT DUMB

335
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:17,559
ENOUGH TO LEAVE A PAPER TRAIL.

336
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,996
YOU   >> Marie: YOU HAVE BEEN

337
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,197
WAITING FOR THIS REPORT AND

338
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:22,931
PUTTING A LOT OF FAITH IN WHAT

339
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:24,400
COMES IN IT.

340
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,670
>> Jesse: I THINK WE HAVE BEEN

341
00:10:27,803 --> 00:10:29,538
WE SAID IT WAS PROBABLY GOING TO

342
00:10:29,538 --> 00:10:31,774
BE A BIG AIR BALL.

343
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:32,708
>> Marie: THIS IS SELECTIVE

344
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,577
HISTORY, FAKE NEWS.

345
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:37,713
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY

346
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:39,248
DID NOT FIND EVIDENCE OF

347
00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:40,416
POLITICAL BIAS AND IMPACT OF THE

348
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,417
INVESTIGATION.

349
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:44,653
THEY ALSO FOUND THAT THEY HAD NO

350
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:47,022
WAY, NO ABILITY TO PROSECUTE

351
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,157
HILLARY CLINTON UNDER THE FIVE

352
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:48,757
STATUTES THEY EXAMINED.

353
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:51,794
I AM NOT IN A TREE BUT THE

354
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:52,995
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LOOKED

355
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:54,930
INTO THE QUESTION THAT A LOT OF

356
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,198
REPUBLICANS AND TRUMP SUPPORTERS

357
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,032
KEEPING ENOUGH AND FOUND THAT

358
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,035
THEY DID THE RIGHT THING.

359
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,204
>> Jesse: WITH THE IG REPORT

360
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,441
SAYS IS THAT WITNESSES, MANNING

361
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:08,444
PROSECUTORS OF THE DOJ OR FBI

362
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:09,244
INVESTIGATORS, DIDN'T THINK THAT

363
00:11:09,244 --> 00:11:11,013
THIS WOULD BE A PROSECUTABLE

364
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:12,247
CASE.

365
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:14,350
IT DOESN'T MEAN THE IG CONCLUDED

366
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,417
THAT WAS THE FACT.

367
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,419
IT JUST MEANT SOME ATTORNEYS

368
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:17,786
DISAGREED.

369
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:18,821
>> Dana: TO FURTHER THAT, I

370
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:20,956
THINK WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS

371
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:21,990
COMEY DID.

372
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,260
THE IG SAYS INSUBORDINATE,

373
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,595
INSUBORDINATION.

374
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:28,597
WHO DID THAT BENEFIT?

375
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:30,733
IT BENEFITED LORETTA LYNCH, THE

376
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:31,633
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

377
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:35,037
HE TOOK IT OUT OF HER HANDS FOR

378
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:37,373
MAKING A CHARGING DECISION THAT

379
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:38,507
I'M SURE PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

380
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:40,142
LORETTA LYNCH DID NOT WANT TO DO

381
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:40,676
TO THEIR NOMINEE.

382
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:42,010
THIS GETS ME BACK TO THE

383
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,846
ORIGINAL POINT OF HOW DO WE KNOW

384
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:44,446
ANY OF THIS?

385
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:46,648
WHY HAVE WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME

386
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:48,817
AND SO MUCH MONEY ON ALL OF

387
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:49,785
THIS?

388
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:50,986
IT GOES BACK TO

389
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:52,221
HILLARY CLINTON'S DECISION TO

390
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:53,789
SUBVERT THE PROCESS, TO HAVE HER

391
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:55,491
OWN EMAIL SYSTEM FROM A HAVE A

392
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:56,592
PRIVATE SERVER.

393
00:11:56,592 --> 00:12:01,029
THAT WAS IN 2015.

394
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,331
WE HAVE SPENT 500 PAGES.

395
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:05,067
IT'S NOW 2018.

396
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:08,904
WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY IS AT LEAST

397
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:13,242
SHE UNCOVERED THE STRZOK AND

398
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:14,109
PAGE EMAIL SITUATION AND THEIR

399
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,245
BIAS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.

400
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:18,213
>> Jesse: WE HAVE BEEN MOVING

401
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:19,515
BACKWARDS FOR A LONG TIME.

402
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:20,416
>> Greg: I REMEMBER WE SAID, I

403
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,819
DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WAS, SHE WAS

404
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:24,653
TALKING ABOUT GENDER.

405
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:25,821
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FEMALE.

406
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:26,989
IT'S ABOUT THE EMAIL.

407
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:29,358
THAT'S WHAT WE KEPT SAYING.

408
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:32,060
A COUPLE OF POINTS.

409
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,165
HOW AMAZING IT MUST NEED TO BE

410
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:36,632
ANTHONY WEINER.

411
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,300
HE MIGHT BE ONE OF THE FEW

412
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,169
PEOPLE WHO IS HAPPY HE IS IN

413
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,838
THE FACT IS IF IT WASN'T FOR HIS

414
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:45,407
LAPTOP AND HIS LAP, TRUMP

415
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:47,776
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ELECTED.

416
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:49,845
HE KEPT -- WE SHOULD BE THINKING

417
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:50,646
ANTHONY WEINER.

418
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:52,347
HE KEPT HILLARY OUT OF OFFICE.

419
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:58,220
IT'S REALLY ABOUT HIM AND HUMA.

420
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,588
MORE EVIDENCE DONALD TRUMP CAN

421
00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:01,824
TURN PEOPLE INTO EMOTIONAL

422
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:02,758
HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN.

423
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:04,393
STRZOK AND PAGE WERE LIKE

424
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:05,194
CHARACTERS IN THE DAVID BOWIE

425
00:13:05,194 --> 00:13:07,396
SONG "HEROES."

426
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:08,096
UP AGAINST THE WALL.

427
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:11,433
THEY ARE GOING TO DO ANYTHING

428
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:12,201
THEY CAN.

429
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:14,603
SO DEEPLY EMOTIONAL FOR THEM.

430
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:15,404
THEY WERE LIKE STAR-CROSSED

431
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:19,808
LOVERS IN A ROMANTIC SONG.

432
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:21,343
>> Kimberly: HOLLYWOOD

433
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:21,710
STARLETS.

434
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,812
>> Greg: I THINK IT IS WEIRD

435
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:25,614
TIMING THAT THE DAY THIS REPORT

436
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:28,417
COMES OUT COME OF THE MEDIA GETS

437
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:29,985
A GIFT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK

438
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:31,386
SUING TRUMP OF THE TRUMP

439
00:13:31,386 --> 00:13:31,787
FOUNDATION.

440
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:35,324
IT'S INCREDIBLY WELL PLAYED.

441
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:37,226
>> Jesse: IT'S JUST A

442
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:37,626
COINCIDENCE.

443
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:39,795
>> Greg: NO, IT'S NOT.

444
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:41,797
PARTY AND MEDIA WORKING

445
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:42,598
HAND-IN-HAND.

446
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:44,266
TO ME IT IS SO OBVIOUS AND

447
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:44,566
WRONG.

448
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:50,472
>> Jesse: IT IS.

449
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:53,609
THEY SAT ON THESE EMAILS FOR A

450
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:54,209
MONTH.

451
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,577
STRZOK WAS BEHIND THE SLOW

452
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:59,214
WALKING TO JAMES COMEY'S OFFICE.

453
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,316
>> Kimberly: IT'S REALLY SAD,

454
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:01,984
ISN'T IT?

455
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:03,652
YOU READ THIS AND BECOME A MOST

456
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:05,020
DESENSITIZE BUT THIS IS REALLY

457
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,654
EGREGIOUS.

458
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:07,656
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FBI,

459
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:09,291
HELD THE HIGHEST REGARD IN TERMS

460
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,926
OF JUSTICE AND SUPPOSED TO BE

461
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:14,196
TRUTH SEEKING AND FACT FINDING

462
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:15,597
WITHOUT ANY IDEOLOGICAL BENT.

463
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:17,399
YOU SEE PEOPLE HERE THAT WERE

464
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,101
HELL-BENT ON UNDERMINING THE

465
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:20,402
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND PREVENTING A

466
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:20,802
PRESIDENCY.

467
00:14:20,802 --> 00:14:23,939
YOU SEE A CANDIDATE IN

468
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:24,673
HILLARY CLINTON THAT COMPLETELY

469
00:14:24,673 --> 00:14:27,175
DISREGARDED THE LAW, THE

470
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:34,082
EVIDENCE, AND REALLY JUST

471
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:34,716
CREATING A SITUATION THAT

472
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:35,417
UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE NOT ONLY

473
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,084
IN OUR POLITICAL PROCESS AND

474
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,920
CAMPAIGNS AND ELECTIONS BUT IN

475
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,221
OUR HIGHEST INVESTIGATORY

476
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:39,588
AGENCIES.

477
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,823
YOU ARE SEEING A MODIFIED,

478
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:42,624
REDACTED REPORT BY ROD

ROSENSTEIN WHO IS ALLOWED TO DO

480
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:44,826
THIS.

481
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:46,628
HE IS ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF

482
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:47,229
ALL THIS.

483
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:48,997
HOW IS IT COMING OUT THIS WITH

484
00:14:48,997 --> 00:14:49,431
CLEAN HANDS?

485
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,966
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE

486
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:52,601
EVIDENCE IS BECAUSE SOME OF IT

487
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:53,368
HAS BEEN REMOVED.

488
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:55,137
>> Jesse: I THINK SOME MEMBERS

489
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:57,606
OF CONGRESS ARE TRYING TO

490
00:14:57,606 --> 00:00:00,000
REQUEST THE ORIGINAL DRAFT OF
