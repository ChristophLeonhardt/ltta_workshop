as we creep closer and closer to the 2018 midterms now just 47 days away the political storms surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is certainly increasing Republican senators and the president are urging professor Christine Blasi Ford to attend Monday's hearing as they try to push through their nominee but that move could come at a big political cost for the GOP in the crucial upcoming midterm elections so guess who's here MSNBC national political correspondent the man who knows elections best our friend Steve connect I do have to ask you like with 47 days out do you start like every night sleeping a little bit less a little bit less to chew for like straight-up all-nighter yeah well we had a few this year with these special elections any training computational math skills are pretty good be ready for this one I think so what what what's the math on this for Republicans there's some danger yeah and and so we're gonna first of all we'll just it will tease what what's coming on this network later today we're gonna have an NBC poll out I think later today that that's gonna look into this and give us a readout and how folks are reacting because we don't know yet we've seen you know obviously all of the controversy the last few days what we knew heading into this when these developments emerged when these accusations emerged this was the most polarizing when you looked at the polls the most polarizing Supreme Court nomination we'd seen going all the way back to Robert Bork in 87 boy the last one to actually lose a confirmation vote is basically dead eve is what we were looking at so the question is all these accusations I asked about that I remember thinking karnaki is like truly encyclopedia brown I love a new it so that you remember Bork Stephanie and I'm like hey it's a verb to Bork someone to disappear you don't want to get bored you're saying we've the NBC poll out today given the election we just come off run meaning that the presidential election how people share this information how they're gonna vote are you depending on these polls as much as you once were especially around issues like this are people really showing what they're doing yeah well I mean again that's that's the question that the 2016 example what was the the biggest scandal to hit Donald Trump in the homestretch of that campaign was the access how they would tape and the assumption even from Republicans was he's cooked okay that's what I wanted you to get to the assumption was he's cooked but a large part of the president's base were Christian conservatives who were holding their nose after the Access Hollywood tape because they said it is all about the judges we want to fill that Supreme Court justice seat one maybe even two this is the holy grail for the president more than tax cuts more than cultural issues his base that truly stays with him are the ones who are there for the Supreme Court justice seat you know this is one of the very rare times we're seeing the president even slightly restrained and I was talking about this this is where I think the politics of this I and again I'm waiting to see what this poll looks like what others look like but this is where the politics of this are potentially complicated I think because you mentioned how important Supreme Court opening Supreme Court vacancies are to the conservative base to the Republican base so if this nomination gets withdrawn if it were to reach that point if it were to you know somehow be derailed and this becomes an open issue does that motivate that base to turn out to make sure that Senate stays Republican make sure it can be filled conversely what have we seen in the Democratic side the last starting the weekend at president Trump's inauguration mobilization of women mobilization around women's issues a historic gender gap when you look at the president's approval rating so the other question we're looking at with the polls is the Democratic base what's really become the Democratic base in the last two years does this motivate them more so it is a question of how each side's going to kind of respond to this isn't that fascinating if he doesn't get confirmed does that turn out the vote for Republicans I was thinking are they going to be disappointed in the president it doubles down near their need to get a you know to get their people who liked it all right Steve good to see you you guys look for Jetport poll midterm season Steve Kornacki hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest interviews and highlights you can get more MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
