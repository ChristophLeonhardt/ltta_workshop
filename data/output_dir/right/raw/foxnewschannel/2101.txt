23
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:02,389
YOU CARE ABOUT INFORMATION

24
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:04,190

IMPEACHMENT OR WHATEVER."

27
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:11,631
THE JUDGE WENT ON TO SAY, "YOU

28
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:13,633
WANT MANAFORT TO SING."

29
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:15,635
AND JUDGE ELLIS ALSO CLAMMING

30
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:16,670

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,471
INVESTIGATION, SAYING, "WE DON'T

32
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:21,675
WANT ANYONE WITH UNFETTERED

33
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:22,008

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,917
BY IT.

39
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:32,786
AND WE WERE LYING."

40
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:34,320
A FEDERAL JUDGE JUST CONFIRMED

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,058
EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN SAYING

42
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:39,859
ON THIS SHOW FOR MONTHS.

43
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:40,860
THERE IS NOTHING MUELLER WILL

44
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,363
NOT DO TO MALIGN THIS PRESIDENT,

45
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:44,397
EVERYONE AROUND HIM.

46
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:46,566
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT TRUMP,

47
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,501
NOT THESE OTHER PEOPLE.

48
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,637
DURING A SPEECH THE PRESIDENT

49
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:54,074
WAS GIVING AT THE NRA, HE

50
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:55,341
REACTED TO THIS.

51
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:56,576
TAKE A LOOK.

52
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:58,611
>>  NONE OF THAT INFORMATION HAS

53
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:01,614
TO DO WITH INFORMATION RELATED

00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:04,017

COORDINATION AND THE CAMPAIGN OF

56
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:06,386
DONALD TRUMP.

57
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:07,153
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO.

58
00:02:07,153 --> 00:02:11,191
IT'S FROM YEARS BEFORE.

59
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:14,494
THEN, HOW DOES THIS HAVE

60
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:16,029

OF LAW, EQUAL JUSTICE AND

68
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:32,979
