Hillary Clinton and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Donald Trump are</font>

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,899
presenting Americans with their

competing<font color="#E5E5E5"> views on trade and the economy</font>

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,090
Hillary Clinton explained how Democrat

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,700
policies would create<font color="#CCCCCC"> jobs let's say</font>

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,110
you're a house builder you may think

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,570
that illogical minimum wage laws and

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,070
overly stringent environmental

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,140
regulations that drive the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,520
labor and materials into the

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,260
stratosphere might put you out of

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,630
business but luckily Democrats are

13
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,310
allowing millions of illegal immigrants

14
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,840
into the country who work off the books

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,029
and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to obey those rules so</font>

16
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can work on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your house much more</font>

17
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,649
cheaply if you still had a house which

18
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,300
of course you don't because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> went out</font>

19

<font color="#E5E5E5">of business but at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least now you qualify</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we have to borrow billions from future</font>

22
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,430
generations so the children of illegal

23
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,500
immigrants who will be legal will

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,000
ultimately have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your will</font>

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,110
welfare so you have revenge meanwhile

26
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,969
Donald Trump offered his plan to restore

27
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,460
the economy<font color="#CCCCCC"> harking back to the 18th</font>

28

century necessity of funding the

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,059
government through tariffs Trump said

30
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,859
that he would renegotiate our foreign

31
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,989
trade deals and if the British continued

32
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,119
to interfere<font color="#CCCCCC"> with our frigates he would</font>

33
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,010
make common cause with the Cherokee and

Iroquois<font color="#E5E5E5"> Indian tribes to drive the</font>

36
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">other nations were stealing such</font>

37

traditional American jobs as pot making

38
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,960
spear sharpening and bison hunting but

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,520
under a trump economy they would all

40
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,490
come back most<font color="#E5E5E5"> economists agree Hillary</font>

41
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,409
Clinton addressed the issue of trade by

42
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,150
saying she<font color="#E5E5E5"> would make deals with foreign</font>

43
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,220
countries that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would bring in hundreds</font>

44
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,140
of millions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in order to</font>

45

47
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,320
but also for Chelsea Clinton and

48
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,689
probably the grandkids as well these

49
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,360
deals with such loyal American allies as

50
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,909
Saudi Arabia Kuwait and Qatar would

51
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,649
enable mrs. Clinton to help clean up the

52
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,329
environment by shutting down American

53
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,790
coal oil and fracking industries while

54
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,619
still getting us enough gas to fuel our

55
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,689
cars by buying billions of dollars worth

56
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">of oil from Arab nations who could then</font>

57
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,040
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fund the Islamist terrorist</font>

58
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,899
groups who kill us thereby<font color="#E5E5E5"> causing there</font>

59
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,520
to be fewer Americans who<font color="#CCCCCC"> need work and</font>

60
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,729
bringing<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the unemployment rate haha</font>

61
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,469
Donald Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> countered that he would</font>

62
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:08,878
bring down the unemployment rate by

ending free trade so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we no longer</font>

64

had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy goods</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from foreigners</font>

65
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,640
could simply trade with one another this

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,770
would cause less competition driving up

67
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,870
prices which mean we means we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would all</font>

68
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,610
get more money for what we sell and

69
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,380
therefore have enough money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay for</font>

70
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,360
the exorbitant prices of the things we

71
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,400
buy causing the prices to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> higher</font>

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
so we would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay</font>

73
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,810
for the even higher prices<font color="#CCCCCC"> until finally</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a pack of gum cost seven thousand</font>

ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> president obama said gosh they all</font>

79
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,700
sounded good to him but then he didn't

I was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to expand my theories to</font>

take in more of the facts my new theory

87

is that Shapiro and Jeremy boring the

would<font color="#E5E5E5"> still be more honest than Hillary</font>

102

Clinton step ahead of the game and and

Bernoulli's principle you know where

this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it would look great and</font>

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,100
the guy would jump off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cliff and</font>

110
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,420
they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put a good face on</font>

Liberty as freedom and the breaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> news</font>

131
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,860
is that Boris Johnson who<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the big</font>

conservative guy he writes a column it

276
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,290
puts it very succinctly what this is

277
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,360
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vote by the people of the</font>

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,190
European Union was actually brexit the

280
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,410
sequel the first brexit vote took place

281
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,990
35 years ago in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United States with</font>

282
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the election of Ronald Reagan who</font>

283
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,400
carried 44 states Reagan and his first

284
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,830
inaugural address in 1981 could not have

285
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,870
been more explicit about what his

286
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,360
election stood for in this present

287
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,700
crisis Reagan said government<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not the</font>

288
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,130
solution to our problem government is

289
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,250
the problem brexit is shorthand for

290
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,230
government is the problem says<font color="#CCCCCC"> henager</font>

291
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,510
liberal intellectuals have mocked<font color="#CCCCCC"> reagan</font>

292
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,220
for reducing his theory of government to

293
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,350
a bumper sticker but he elaborated on

294
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the idea with words that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would have fit</font>

295
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,030
in the founders debates here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Reagan</font>

296
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,420
again we have been tempted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to believe</font>

297
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,420
that society has become too complex to

298
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,510
be managed by self rule that government

299
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,580
by an elite group is superior to

300
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,720
government for

301
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">by and of the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but if no one among</font>

302
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">us is capable of governing himself then</font>

303
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:09,990
who among us has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity to govern</font>

304
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,920
someone else perfect logic this thing

305
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,420
about everything has gotten too

306
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,490
complicated it basically started with

307
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,709
Woodrow Wilson he was the expert he was

308
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,329
the intellectual he was a very Obama

309
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:23,819
like figure Rihanna think he was I think

310
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:25,319
he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a terrible president but he was a</font>

311
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:27,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">first guy I guess Teddy Roosevelt was</font>

312
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,339
first guy to say it was a progressive

313
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,620
but Woodrow Wilson was right up there he

314
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,980
was you know he was said that the

315

317
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,680
thing experts have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run the country</font>

318

Obama the same thing he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I wish I</font>

319
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,399
could just sit down<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the experts and</font>

320
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,810
solve all our problems but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got this</font>

321
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,759
crappy democracy thing that keeps

322
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:50,339
getting on on our way so Donald Trump

323
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,439
has tried to pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> up you know he's not</font>

324
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:54,420
an idiot he's tried to pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> up I take</font>

326
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">of idiot he has tried to pick up on that</font>

327
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:00,629
populist feeling with this speech he

328
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:02,490
made earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the week about the</font>

329
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">economy that was just I listen you know</font>

330
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,910
there's a poll out today from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rasmussen</font>

331
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,649
kind of an outlier poll that has him<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

332
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:15,180
hit has Trump ahead and I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Ben</font>

333
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,279
thinks Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> has no chance I don't I</font>

334
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,959
don't believe that for a second this has

335
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,939
really been a good two weeks for Donald

336
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,470
Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was the abortion decision</font>

337
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,529
which even had me thinking if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

338
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,149
some chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Donald Trump might</font>

339
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:29,610
smoke a doobie and stumble into a room

340
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,949
and appoint a good justice just by

341
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:34,740
accident I'll vote for him you know if

342
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,629
there's some chance to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hillary</font>

343
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:39,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Clinton from filling the one two three</font>

344
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,490
or four<font color="#E5E5E5"> spots</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that could come up in the</font>

345
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,680
next four years you know it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

346
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,209
worth it to stop and that abortion

347
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:47,100
decision made me crazy made a lot of

348
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,949
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy this this new attack and</font>

349
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:53,519
Istanbul with Obama clueless about what

350
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,620
to do and clueless about why we're being

351
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,629
attacked and clues about how to stop it

352
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:59,519
you know it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes Trump look good</font>

353
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,930
and it wouldn't surprise me but he made

354
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,300
a speech about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> economy that was as</font>

355
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,819
bad as it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be just here's just a</font>

356
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,300
piece of it that he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking in this</font>

357
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,160
effect it's like he's talking from

358
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,769
inside of dumpsters on they go ahead

359
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:14,689
but if we're going to deliver real

360
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:16,850
change we're going to have to reject<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

361
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,459
campaign of fear and intimidation being

362
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:23,059
pursued by powerful corporations media

363
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:26,389
elites and political dynasties the

364
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,029
people who rigged the system for their

365
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:31,279
benefit will do anything and say

366
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,850
anything to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep things exactly the way</font>

367
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,720
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who rigged the</font>

368
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,660
system are supporting Hillary Clinton

369
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,959
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know as long as she is in</font>

370
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,799
charge nothing's going to change the

371
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,290
inner cities will remain poor the

372
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,529
factories will remain closed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the borders</font>

373
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:58,639
will remain open the<font color="#E5E5E5"> special interest</font>

374
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,519
will remain firmly in control Hillary

375
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,110
Clinton<font color="#E5E5E5"> and her friends and global</font>

376
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,480
finance want to scare America<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

377
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,600
thinking small and they want to scare

378
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,779
American people out of voting for the

379
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,249
better future and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a great</font>

380
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:15,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">future folks you have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great future</font>

381
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,379
these people have given<font color="#CCCCCC"> her tens of</font>

382
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:22,040
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars my campaign has the</font>

383
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:29,959
absolute opposite message I want you to

384
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,249
imagine a much better life and a life

385
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,559
where you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe in the American</font>

386
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,240
dream again right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you can't do that</font>

387
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,059
now that's what Trump is really good at

388
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:45,829
what Trump is good at is getting to the

389
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:48,079
problem touching that tone of you know

390
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,209
working class anger or we've been

391
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:51,920
cheated we've been robbed you know we

392
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,600
was we was robbed that the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

393
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,629
but when he starts talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

394
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,279
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to destroy NAFTA he's going to get</font>

395
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">rid of free trade he's gonna put tariffs</font>

396
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:02,480
I mean tariffs you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I don't</font>

397
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanna get into the high weeds about this</font>

398
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:06,169
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the ideas are bad the ideas</font>

399
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:07,669
are bad the more people you can trade

400
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:09,799
with I mean it's simple logic if I have

401
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:12,499
a books if I have a book to sell there

402
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:14,419
are three people in this room I can get

403
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,279
a better price if I have 15 people I can

404
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,480
get a better price if I have 30 people

405
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">and yes think you know jobs and goods</font>

406
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,499
are goods are cheaper goods are going to

407
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:23,419
come in from outside and some jobs are

408
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to leave</font>

409
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,480
at the end of his speech at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of</font>

410
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,640
Trump speech after talking absolute pure

411
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,600
protectionist nonsense Trump got to the

412
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,700
real problem for like one sentence that

413
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,680
mean I will quote the end of this we

414
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">will make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> America the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best place in the</font>

415
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,410
world to start a<font color="#CCCCCC"> business hire workers</font>

416
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,900
and open a factory this includes massive

417
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,180
tax reform to lift the crushing burdens

418
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,920
on American workers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and businesses and</font>

419
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,900
the tax is crushing I mean we have let

420
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,060
this get it completely out of an we will

421
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,730
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of wasteful rules and</font>

422
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,720
regulations which are destroying<font color="#E5E5E5"> our job</font>

423
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,670
creation capacity many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

424
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">these regulations are an even greater</font>

425
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,330
impediment than the fact that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

426
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the highest tax nations in the world</font>

427
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,480
I'm one of those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know one of</font>

428
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,250
the things that happen we had a crash in

429
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,410
2008 that was like the crash that

430
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,940
started the Great Depression<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

431
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,080
thing that stopped it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from being that</font>

432
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad is we had gotten so rich because of</font>

433
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,750
free trade and because of capitalism and

434
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,860
because of Reagan cutting you know is

435
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,870
reforming the tax code and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Clinton's</font>

436
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,460
sort of sticking to that we had gotten

437
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">so rich in the meantime that we didn't</font>

438
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,330
need bread lines we didn't have

439
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,920
Hoovervilles you know it was it was a

440
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,680
crash was just as bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> that crash was</font>

441
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,800
caused by what Frederick Hayek calls the

442
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,860
fatal conceit the fatal conceit is that

443
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,140
the world can be run better from the top

444
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,240
than it can buy the people that the

445
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,700
people can control oh yeah we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

446
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,680
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> goodbye to Facebook pardon me thank</font>

447
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">you John doesn't take a bite of Facebook</font>

448
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,410
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish this conversation</font>

449
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,160
elsewhere be there at the daily wire the

450
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,320
fatal conceit is that people at the top

451
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,080
can run the economy better than people

452
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,460
at the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the ordinary guy</font>

453
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,740
making his own decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and this</font>

454
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,690
is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in 2008 we had a crash</font>

455
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,280
because the government said to people

456
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to loan said to the banks you</font>

457
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,660
have to loan money to people who can't

458
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">afford to pay it back because they're</font>

459
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,439
black and you're being<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfair to them by</font>

460
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,720
not being racist they weren't being

461
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,819
racist it was shown later in studies

462
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,170
that they weren't being racist they just

463
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,579
weren't loaning money to people who

464
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,589
couldn't pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back so with government</font>

465
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Fiat with government backing they</font>

466
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,010
started loaning money to people who

467
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,959
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford it those loans went into</font>

468
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,730
the economic system with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wall Street</font>

469
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of control The Wall Street started</font>

499
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,390
these guys down their throat they have

500
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,430
taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and that's on top of the</font>

501
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,680
takeover of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care industry</font>

502
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,100
these people have stuffed our economy

503
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,200
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pocket of government and it is</font>

504
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,290
stuck there meanwhile you can smell you

505
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,150
can feel the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reinvent</font>

506
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,580
the economy that uber they've got Airbnb

507
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,810
and wherever these things pop up

508
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,490
suddenly the government is going wait a

509
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,870
minute wait a minute I didn't get a

510
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,330
bribe for your taxi license I didn't get

511
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,610
a bribe you know for you didn't pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

512
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,380
regulations and have the fire for your

513
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,690
Airbnb you know I'm gonna I got to be

514
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,250
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send inspectors around or I</font>

515
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get mine because that's the big</font>

516
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,090
flaw in capitalism by the way is that

517
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,250
the top guys don't get their bribes

518
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,590
that's why they it works perfectly

519
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,940
capitalism just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit of</font>

520
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,920
regulation to keep everything fair to

521
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,450
make sure nobody lies nobody cheats

522
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,760
those regulations are great nobody wants

523
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,560
an unregulated society you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't have it</font>

524
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,730
it doesn't exist so now Obama who is the

525
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:36,140
president you may recall he is in Canada

526
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,540
right with the three amigos the Canada

527
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,750

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,580
right up his snooty I mean Trump has

530
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,060

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,200
shown any regard for workers has never

542
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,610

<font color="#CCCCCC">and ordinary people they don't suddenly</font>

548
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,070
become a populist because they say

549
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,680
something controversial in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> win</font>

550
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:47,210
votes stop a measure of populism

551
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,600
that's nativism or xenophobia

552
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,859
[Music]

553
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:04,630
or worse where's just cynicism so I

554
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,550
would just advise everybody be careful

555
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:12,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">about suddenly attributing to whoever</font>

556
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,050
pops up at a time of economic anxiety

557
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:20,980
the label that their populace where

558
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,420
they've been have they been on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front</font>

559
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,980
lines working on that of working people

560
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,150
they've been carrying the<font color="#E5E5E5"> laboring order</font>

561
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,130
open up opportunities for more people

562
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,440
now there there there people like Bernie

563
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,240
Sanders<font color="#E5E5E5"> who I've I think genuinely</font>

564
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,640
deserved the title because he has been

565
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,070
in the vineyards fight on behalf of

566
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,090
these issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're the questions</font>
