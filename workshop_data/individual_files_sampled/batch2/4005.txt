12 hours from now when President Trump is set to reveal his nominee to join the Supreme Court he spent most of the weekend talking to aides and some of his old friends about who he should choose but as of Sunday afternoon in true trunk drama fashion he had feared he had still not made up his mind let's say it's the four people but and they're excellent everyone you can't go wrong but I'm getting very close to making a final decision I'll probably be decided tonight or tomorrow sometimes by 12 o'clock and I think we're going to all be meeting at 9 o'clock and we have a great country folks we have a great country he knows how to create a cliffhanger that is his jam right now a source with first-hand knowledge of President Trump Supreme Court selection process tells NBC News none of the top four contenders have been excluded those four are Brett Kavanaugh Thomas Hardman Raymond Catholic and Amy Kony Barrett but that same source tells NBC the two judges getting the most attention are Brett Kavanaugh and Thomas Hartman so let's break down those potential nominees who is Cavanaugh he is the 53 year old currently serving on the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit on the plus side he is a favorite of White House Counsel Don McGann who has been key to helping the president through this process but he also has size to George W Bush which could be problematic for Trump supporters one other issue with Cavanaugh he's got 12 years worth of decisions that senators would want to go meticulously through potentially delaying the confirmation on the other hand Thomas Hartmann may have a much easier time getting confirmed that's the opinion of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who reportedly spoke to president trunk in recent days President mint also picked Hardman for the Supreme Court last time but ended up going with Neal Gorsuch instead Hardiman also has the support and this is important of president Trump's sister judge Mary Ann Trump Barry who served with him in Philadelphia neither Barrett nor Catholic appeared to increase their chances after they met with the president but as we said before mr. Trump has not publicly ruled out anyone one other issue with Bharath her views on a bore could draw opposition from pro-choice Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski remember if all Democrats oppose the nominee and John McCain cannot vote either one of those two women could sink the nomination that said several Republicans have said the president has an excellent group to choose from hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
