Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio as awful as the Trump administration is totally unnecessary policy of tearing children away from their parents is it turns out it could actually get darker than that and that is when they begin to use the Bible to justify what they're doing and we've got two members of the Trump administration now doing that before we get to their statements though I do want to update you on the current status of this child tearing away policy from April 19th through to the end of May border officials separated nineteen hundred and ninety five children from nineteen hundred and forty adults with whom they were traveling I mean those numbers are crazy I think not great at math but I believe it works out to one child every thirty minutes which is actually it's actually a moment and so bear that in mind as we go forward with what they're saying about the Bible first we have Sarah Huckabee Sanders where does it say in the Bible that is world to take children away from their mothers I'm not aware of the Attorney General's comments or what he would be referencing I can say that it is very biblical to enforce the law that is actually repeated a number of times throughout the Bible imagine if Jesus was watching that little exchange right there I don't believe in any of that stuff but I don't think that it would be wet very well-received yeah so I know that people who are in power love to quote that part of the Bible where they say you know give unto Caesar what is his the only reason that the Bible tells you that is so that you're not immediately executed which is what happened back in the day by the way one person didn't agree with that his name was Jesus Christ and he was executed yeah by the government so this whole idea of oh no you should just bow your head to the government that's what Jesus would want you to do is the most part Posterous thing you could imagine let alone coming from a conservative so the gunman rips big government rips your kids away from you remember Jesus would abound you're his hat well let's let's be honest the the concept of ripping children from their parents as this broad punishment is actually incredibly biblical it's just not the Bible that everybody cites it's so Old Testament we're like God flooded the world and killed everybody because he was pissed off that's super biblical and I can't say that they're wrong they're just not being honest about it yeah it's just according the wrong part yeah it's it's not that Jesus loves everyone and thinks everyone shouldn't be hungry part when I think of it if anyone tried to rip my two year old or my five-year-old daughter away from me that you wouldn't want to see the wrath that I would that I would feel and that I would display and you know actually my opponent congressman Yoder was recently named as chairman of the Homeland Security subcommittee and the Appropriations Committee and he went down to Texas to figure out the situation came back he said it was heartbreaking but but what do you think he's actually done to fix anything absolutely nothing now I will say he doesn't exactly have a lot of respect for the Bible so maybe that's why you know the Sea of Galilee that Jesus walked on believe it or not Kevin Yoder when he was a congressman took a diplomatic mission to Israel and got drunk and went skinny-dipping in the sea okay so but I do want to give religious people credit because I was a little bit stunned that evangelical leaders came out against this policy because in my opinion they've been wildly hypocritical in the past and their support of Donald Trump but of all people in the world Reverend Franklin Graham saying families quote being ripped apart were quote disgraceful yeah to do that was disgraceful for him to criticize Trump that heavily is shocking yeah and I I'm not a biblical scholar maybe someone can can send this information I don't know which particular versus is from but I believe that there's a reference in the Bible to it would be better to tie a row of rope around a rock and around your body and throw it into the ocean before hurting a child so maybe they could read that part before doing more of this tearing the kids away so there was a little bit more from that interaction with Sarah happy Sanders though another reporter wanted to provide her a lifeline an opportunity to show some sort of humanity on this issue and let's see how she responded if Democrats when I get serious about it instead of playing political games they're welcome to come here and sit down with the president and actually do something about it come on Sarah you're a parent don't you have any empathy for what these people are going to they have less try I'm trying to be serious but I'm not gonna have you yell out of turn Jill listen the law and and they have that these people have nothing hey I know you wanna get some more TV it's a serious question these people have nothing they come to the border with nothing and he brought children and cages you're a parent girls down to dumb children don't you have any empathy for what they go through Jill Moorhead she is an absolute monster he gave her every opportunity to show one ounce of compassion for what these kids are going forth through but that's not what she's there for and after watching that III think back to the White House Correspondents Dinner and I wish Michelle wolf and Savage or even worse I wish her entire speech had been about that woman yeah look I've defended her a hundred times only because Trump asked her to go do these things and she's a minion and she's got to go do them and she's got to go through this on the other hand she didn't have to take the job or she could quit any day yeah well she's on her way out I think right so that's not just so confirmed she's on yeah no no she actually said she's praying on it for she's praying for clarity I'm today God won't be responding so we keep making references to the tearing families apart and there's been this way of thankfully of activism around this issue many many protests of keeping families together and so I think for most people regardless of whether you are religious or not what religion you follow there's this natural aversion of the concept of breaking families apart now I want you to see how the White House has taken that messaging and that theme and what they're using it for let's bring this next graphic so you're seeing there this is from the White House and it says there look at this Juan Pino was permanently separated from his daughter after she was strangled raped and murdered by an illegal alien Laura Wilkinson was permanently separated from her son who was brutally murdered by an illegal alien classmate jbeil Shaw senior was permanently separated from his son who was tragically murdered by an illegal alien gang member so for those people who are worried about these families being totally willfully unnecessarily and cruelly separated they then once again tried to scare you with this boogeyman of foreign Mexican crime crossing the border and killing Americans you know they think the the Senator Merkley wanted to actually go down and check out one of these facilities and they wouldn't let him do it as saying US senator he's a representative and that's unbelievable but they did finally let some press in there I'm sure maybe after you know dressing it up as much as possible but still an MSc NBC reporter said that it looked like the kids were in prison they were held in overcrowded buildings for 22 hours a day and he said quote they feel like animals locked in a cage being looked at that was actually well the people who work at the facility who said our order which is even worse person maintaining kids is they they're like animals locked in a cage and they're let out into the sunshine for only two hours a day and and so I this is a really important because I want you to understand what the point that John was making so they they're being criticized for taking these little kids away from their parents and in fact by the way if you don't know they tell their parents don't worry we're gonna give them a bath and they of course they don't they just take the kids and move them States away and they don't tell the parents where the kids are it's just it's heartbreaking anybody who's got kids and if even if you don't and you have an ounce of empathy you'll understand it that's just heartbreaking right and and and then they take those the the criminals that killed people or whatever and they move the shells around and they're like well they separated people from their family waited but the kids didn't do that you took the kids away there's 10 euro Casa padre we did the ten year old do any of that no but what you did was immigrants killers immigrants criminals we were talking about the kids and you switched the topic to criminals and you did that on purpose to try to deceive people it's it's super gross and it's not it's not the first time I mean we had obviously we've been talking about dreamers and then they tried to conflate the dreamers who we know commit crimes at lower rates than other Americans they own own homes at higher rates to participate in the military more higher graduation rates from college and they started spreading that disgusting Americans are dreamers to BS it's just disgusting look III came to the country legally and and I came because I think it's a land of opportunity my parents came and and we believed in the American dream so in that sense we're dreamers but by the way they would stop that too and the reason this era how could be Sanders is repeating Donald Trump's lie about the Democrats are making us do it it is preposterous that is 100% a lie unmitigated lie and so they're saying well if the Democrats would agree to our draconian laws that would actually make it even harsher well then maybe we won't we could stop taking away people's kids well you made the choice to take away people's kids never as in may you do that that's totally not true and in and what are the things that they want the Democrats did agree to funding for the wall and there's a whole list including by the way keeping the kids for longer why would they agree to that that's insanity right and then the last thing is they want to end legal immigration so they say whether you got a visa won the Visa Lottery okay look that's the debatable policy issue but what they call chain migration that's American citizens bringing their family members here that's the most common legal way to come to America so they're trying to attack legal immigrants they don't believe in the American dream for a second they also recently started looking into naturalized citizens for any irregularities in their you know immigration paperwork to strip immigration from already legal citizens yeah it's an all-out attack and the fact that the Trump administration is ripping children away from their families and putting them in what I think can reasonably called concentration camps or internment camps because they can't leave and it's a huge concentration of kids which are all inside of an abandoned Walmart that is so on the nose for the Trump administration to do this as hold these kids hostage to try to get funding for the wall to try to stop legal immigration it's it's also I it's a little bit confusing so I you should not pay as much attention on the news I'm forced to buy my job but I listen to Donald Trump spreading a lie about that this is the Democrats that did this it's the Democrats fault and then you know you get Jeff Sessions and Sarah happy Sanders talking about the Bible so which is it it from the morning it's a terrible evil cruel thing the Democrats are making us do also the Bible says we have to do it and it's awesome that we're doing it because it's moral and difficult to do so that doesn't make any sense they also keep saying that it's the law and it's not it's it's a policy guideline Congress did not say rip kids away from their families two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell
