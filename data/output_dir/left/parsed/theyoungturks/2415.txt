FORMER REPRESENTATIVE JACK
KINGSTON WAS ON CNN.
I'M NOT SURE HE PICKED THE RIGHT
SHOW TO PULL THIS MANEUVER.
I WOULD THINK THE STUDENTS HAD
PRETTY GOOD ROUNDS TO BE UPSET
AND PRETTY GOOD MOTIVATION TO
ORGANIZE.
THIS IS THE GUY WHO WAS OFTEN
CALLED A MODERATE REPUBLICAN.
LET'S SEE IF THAT IS THE CASE.
WATCH.
YOU ARE SERIOUS YOU THINK
THESE KIDS ARE NOT ACTING ON
THEIR OWN VOLITION?
ALLISON, I THINK IT'S A
HORRIBLE TRAGEDY AND I'M
HEARTBROKEN THAT YOUNG PEOPLE
HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS AND I
HOPE IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN, BUT
I ALSO KNOW THEIR SORROW CAN
VERY EASILY BE HIJACKED BY LEFT
WING GROUPS WHO HAVE AN AGENDA.
LET'S ASK OURSELVES DO WE REALLY
THINK 17-YEAR-OLDS ON THEIR OWN
ARE GOING TO PLAN A NATIONWIDE
RALLY?
I WOULD SAY TO YOU VERY PLAINLY
THAT ORGANIZE GROUPS THAT ARE
OUT THERE LIKE GEORGE SOROS ARE
ALWAYS READY TO TAKE THE
CHARGE AND IT IS KIND OF LIKE
INSTANT RALLY, INSTANT PROTEST.
SO WHO WOULD LOOK AT THIS
MASSACRE AND SAY REALLY?
THESE
KIDS HIS OTHER BEST FRIENDS
MURDERED IN FRONT OF THEM WOULD
BE MOTIVATED TO PULL OFF A
RALLY?
WHO WOULD BE THAT DEEPLY
CYNICAL?
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING, IT IS THE HARDEST
THING IN THE WORLD IS TO ESCAPE
YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE AND FROM A
REPUBLICAN PERSPECTIVE EVERY
RALLY IS FINANCED BY SOME
OUTSIDE BILLIONAIRE OR
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION.
EVERY MOVEMENT IS FINANCED BY
THEM.
SO JACK KINGSTON NORMALLY
PROJECTS.
WHEN THE TEA PARTY HAPPENING
THEIR ORIGINAL RALLY WAS THE
BAILOUTS.
THAT IS ACTUALLY A RALLYING CRY
TOTALLY A LOT OF LIBERALS AND
PROGRESSIVES WOULD JOIN IF
THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT.
THEY NEVER DID A SINGLE PROTEST
ABOUT WALL STREET.
BECAUSE GIANT BUSES PULLED UP.
KOCH BROTHERS PULLED UP BUSES
THAT ARTIE HAD PAINTINGS
AGAINST OBAMA CARE PUT
ONTO 
THE BUSES.
SINCE THAT'S WHAT REPUBLICANS DO
JACK KINGSTON THINKS THE
DEMOCRATS MUST DO THE SAME.
THESE KIDS ACTUALLY SAW THEIR
FRIENDS GET KILLED AND ALLISON
WILL STRAIGHTEN IT OUT ANYWAY.
I'M SORRY I HAVE TO CORRECT
YOU, I WAS DOWN THERE AND TALK
TO THOSE KIDS.
THESE KIDS WERE WILDLY
MOTIVATED.
I TALKED TO THESE KIDS BEFORE
THEY KNEW THE BODY COUNT OF HOW
MANY OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD
BEEN KILLED.
NO ONE HAD TALKED TO THEM YET.
THEY HAD NOT BEEN INDOCTRINATED
BY SOME LEFT RING GROUP.
THEY WERE MOTIVATED FROM WHAT
THEY SAW AND WHAT THEY ENDURED.
ALLISON,
I DON'T DOUBT THEIR SINCERITY.
YES YOU DO.
I ABSOLUTELY KNOW THESE
CHILDREN ARE HEARTBROKEN, BUT I
ALSO KNOW THEY PROBABLY DO NOT
HAVE THE LOGISTICAL ABILITY TO
PLAN A NATIONWIDE RALLY WITHOUT
IT BEING HIJACKED BY GROUPS
ALREADY HAVE THE PRE-EXISTING
ANTI-GUN AGENDA.
JACK, IS JUST SILLY.
THEY ARE ON BUSES GOING TO THE
STATE LEGISLATURE TODAY.
THEY ARE 17 YEARS OLD THEY CAN
FIGURE THIS OUT.
I JUST HAVE A HARD TIME
BELIEVING IT.
SEE.
HE HAS A HARD TIME
BELIEVING THEY HAD MONEY FOR THE
BUS BECAUSE WHENEVER THEY DO A
RALLY SOMEBODY ALREADY PROVIDES
THE BUS AND IT WAS ONE OF
THEIR DONORS.
THE REALITY IS KIDS ARE DOING
FUNDRAISING RIGHT NOW.
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HAPPY TO
GIVE THE MONEY BECAUSE THEY
ARE OUTRAGED BY WHAT HAPPENED.
OF COURSE IT IS THE REPUBLICAN
IDEA OF 
THE YOUNG.
MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT WAS
THEM SAYING JACK.
NOW FINALLY LET THE KIDS
RESPOND.
I THINK IT'S VERY DESPICABLE
THAT HE WOULD EVEN HAVE THE
AUDACITY TO SAY THAT.
YOUNG PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS
COUNTRY AND OVER THE WORLD
SHOULD FEEL THEY HAVE THE POWER
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT ESPECIALLY
IN THE WAKE OF THE TRAGEDY WE
REALLY SHOW WHO WE TRULY ARE.
TO SAY THAT JUST BECAUSE WE ARE
YOUNG WE CAN'T MAKE A
DIFFERENCE IS NOT RIGHT AND HE
SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
THE REASON WHY 
IS BECAUSE
THERE IS THE MERCER'S OR
INCREDIBLY RICH DONORS WHO WOULD
LIKE TAX CUTS AND DEREGULATION.
SO THAT IS WHY THEY NATURALLY
THINK THEY MUST BE LIKEWISE.
I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU THERE ARE
ACTUAL CITIZENS IN THIS
COUNTRY WHO CARE ABOUT THINGS.
THEY DON'T NEED A BILLIONAIRE TO
TELL YOU THEY CARE.
THEY ACTUALLY CARE AND
ACTUALLY WHAT ACTION.
