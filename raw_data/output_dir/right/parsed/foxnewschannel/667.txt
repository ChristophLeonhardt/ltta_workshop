REJOINING THE ECONOMY.
VINCE, JEHMU, APPRECIATE IT.
HAVE A WONDERFUL WEEKEND.
>> MEANWHILE REPUBLICAN
HE TOLD MY COLLEAGUE BRET BAIER
IN HIS FIRST EXTENSIVE INTERVIEW
ON ALL OF THIS THAT THE
PEOPLE COMING UP AND TALKING
ABOUT ABUSE.
NO ONE REPORTED ABUSE TO ME.
IF THEY HAD, I WOULD HAVE DEALT
WITH IT.
WHAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST IS THE
GUYS THAT ARE SAYING THIS, I
KNOW THEY KNOW THE TRUTH.
I KNOW THEY DO.
>> ALL RIGHT.
OUR SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER
IS BREAKING DOWN THE LATEST
DEVELOPMENTS FOR US TONIGHT LIVE
IN WASHINGTON.
CHAD, TALK ABOUT THE STRATEGY
FROM JIM JORDAN.
HE MADE SOME SMALLER COMMENTS AT
A FOURTH OF JULY PARADE, AND
WHATNOT, BUT SITTING DOWN WITH
BRET THERE'S A CLEAR STRATEGY
HERE TO PUSH BACK.
>> RIGHT.
HE FEELS VERY UPSET.
HE SAYS, LOOK, I WORKED WITH THE
FOLKS --
>> THE ACCUSER.
>> RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY.
HE SAYS, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
HIS ISSUE HAS BEEN TO GO AFTER
THE ACCUSER.
MILIEU HE HOLDS MORE CONTEMPT
FOR.
>> MIKE DISABATO HAS ARRESTED
FIVE MONTHS AGO, HE HAS ALL
HAVE COME FORWARD THAT ARE NOT
NAMED MIKE DISABATO.
PEOPLE ARE SAYING, WAIT A
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW JIM
JORDAN, WHO LIKE HIM, AND SAY HE
NEEDS TO SPEAK UP.
>> WHAT ABOUT PERKINS COIE WHO
SENT OUT EMAILS TO CONGRESSMAN
JORDAN, HE SAYS HE DOESN'T
RECEIVE THEM.
IN THE LAST ELECTION, WE'VE
HEARD ABOUT HOW PERKINS COIE WAS
INVOLVED IN PUTTING TOGETHER THE
ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER.
>> HE SAID THAT'S THE HILLARY
CLINTON LAW FIRM.
I THINK IT'S FUNNY WHEN I TAKE
ON ONE OF THESE WITNESSES, AND
EVERY LIBERAL IN THE COUNTRY CAN
FIND MY EMAIL AND PHONE NUMBER
AND CALL UP AND EXPRESS THEIR
VIEWS, AND HE SAYS THEY CAN'T
GET AHOLD OF ME?
I'VE BEEN PRIVY TO THE EMAIL
SENT TO THE INCORRECT EMAIL
TRANSACTIONAL, BUT JIM JORDAN
SAYS HE'S GOING TO TALK WITH
THEM NEXT WEEK.
IF YOU'RE DOING AN
INVESTIGATION, IS THERE A
UNIVERSE OF 10 PEOPLE?
IS THERE A UNIVERSE OF 100
PEOPLE?
IF THERE'S PEOPLE WHO THEY
REALLY ABSOLUTELY UNEQUIVOCALLY
WANTED TO TALK TO, THEY COULD
HAVE FOUND JIM JORDAN.
HE'S NOT HARD TO FIND.
>> DURING THE ME TOO MOVEMENT,
PROMINENT PEOPLE, LIKE HARVEY
WEINSTEIN, A GRAND JURY IN NEW
YORK CITY, THAT'S CRYSTALLIZED
THE ALLEGATIONS, AND PEOPLE SEEK
WHAT'S WITH JIM JORDAN?
WILL THEY LOOK AT THIS.
>> THEY COULD HAVE THEM LOOK AT
THIS TO UNDERSTAND, GET CLARITY.
THE FREE CAUCUS, HIM ONE OF THE
TWO HEAD HONCHOS, THEY HAVE TO
MAKE A DECISION WHEN MEMBERS
RETURN, TO SAY, WAIT A MINUTE,
IS THERE A CLOUD HANGING OVER
JIM JORDAN, IS THERE A TRACKS?
I NOTICE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
VICE PRESIDENT BEEN RETURNING
PHONE CALLS.
I DID TALK TO SOME TONIGHT.
THEY'RE CIRCLING THE WAGONS.
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED
WITH SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HAVE AN
ETHICS PROBLEM LIKE THIS, ED.
>> BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DON'T
KNOW WHAT'S TRUE, WHAT'S NOT
TRUE, FROM A COUPLE DECADES AGO.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S HARD TO PROVE, HARD TO
