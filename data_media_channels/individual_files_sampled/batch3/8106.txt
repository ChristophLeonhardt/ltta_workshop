â™ª TODAY WE'RE TALKING TRADE, WE'RE TALKING MILITARY. WE JUST LOOKED AT SOME INCREDIBLE ANTITERRORISM STATES. AND THE RELATIONSHIP IS VERY, VERY STRONG. STEVE: THEY GOT PRESIDENT BRIAN: GOING TO HAVE A BIG PRESS CONFERENCE IN TWO HOURS. THE MEETING COMES AFTER THE PRESIDENT SLAMS THERESA MAY INDIRECTLY KIND OF OVER HER FOR U.S. RELATIONS FOR THE AINSLEY: HERE TO REACT IS U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY LEADER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND OUR FRIEND NIGEL FARAGE. GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING. GOOD MORNING. AINSLEY: HE HAD THE INTERVIEW WITH THE SUN AND HE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT THERESA MAY THE SOFT EXIT FROM BREXIT. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE RECOMMENDED. IF SHE MAINTAINS CLOSE TIES WITH THE EU, THEN THAT LUCRATIVE U.S. TRADE DEAL IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. HE WAS PRAISING BORIS JOHNSON, SAYING HE WOULD BE A GOOD PRIME MINISTER. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT ALL OF THIS RIGHT BEFORE IS HE SITTING DOWN WITH THE PRIME MINISTER? THIS INTERVENTION HAS COME AS A BOMBSHELL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT HERE IN AND THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR KILLER LINE. IT'S WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THIS IS NOT THE BREXIT THAT PEOPLE VOTED FOR. WHAT HE IS REFERRING TO IS A MEETING OF THE U.K. CABINET A WEEK AGO TODAY WHERE THEY AGREED TO WATER DOWN BREXIT BAKE CONTROL PROPERLY OF OUR LAWS. WE WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE EUROPEAN COURT. WE WOULDN'T HAVE FULL BORDER CONTROLS. AND CRUCIALLY FOR AMERICA, YOU KNOW, MRS. MAY HAS BEEN TELLING TRUMP ONCE WE ARE DONE WITH THE BREXIT WE WILL BE DEAL. THIS DOCUMENT MEANS THAT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. TRUMP'S INTERVENTION IS BASED ON TWO THINGS. BY THE WAY, I WASN'T SURPRISED BY THIS BECAUSE I KNOW HOW HE AND THOSE IN HIS ADMINISTRATION FEEL ON THESE ISSUES. NUMBER ONE, TRUMP BELIEVES IN BREXIT. HE BELIEVES IN A WORLD OF DEMOCRATIC NATION STATES COOPERATING WITH EACH OTHER. NOT GLOBALIST STRUCTURES LIKE THE EUROPEAN UNION. AND NUMBER TWO, I THINK HE FEELS THAT THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY BADLY LET DOWN. STEVE: WELL, YOU SUPPORTED BREXIT. DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTED BREXIT. THERESA MAY DID NOT SUPPORT BREXIT AND NOW SHE HAS ON HER HANDS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. DO YOU THINK HER TIME IS LIMITED NOW AT 10 DOWNING STREET. IS THE METER RUNNING AND MAYBE BORIS JOHNSON IS IN NEXT? DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING, TO PUT THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE TO DO THESE THINGS, YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN IT. AND THERESA MAY AS YOU POINT OUT WAS A REMAINER. LET'S BE FRANK, SHE'S NOT UP TO THE JOB. IF SHE STAYS AS PRIME MINISTER, WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET THE BREXIT WE VOTED FOR. THE SENSE OF BETRAYAL IN THIS COUNTRY WILL BE HUGE. AND I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT YEAH. THE FAVORITE TO SUCCEED HER IS BORIS. YOU KNOW, AND BORIS DID AND OKAY IT TOOK A LONG TIME, BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE LINE, BORIS DID BACK BREXIT. BRIAN: NIGEL, A COUPLE OF THINGS. IT SEEMS BEHIND THE SCENES THE PRESIDENT DID BACK THE PRESIDENT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AT THE NATO SUMMIT. THEY DO SEEM TO BE BUILDING A PERSONAL BOND. WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN THIS STORY BROKE, DO YOU THINK, DURING DINNER YESTERDAY? I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE IT. I MEAN, THE SCENE, YOU KNOW, THE PALACE, THE BIRTHPLACE OF WINSTON CHURCHILL. WE HAD THE BIG MILITARY BANDS ON PARADE. THE WEATHER WAS BEAUTIFUL. THERESA MAY WAS IN HER EVENING DRESS. MET THE PRESIDENT AND I CAN'T IMAGINE AS COFFEE WAS SERVED SOMEBODY WHISPERING IN THERESA MAY'S EAR PRIME MINISTER THERE IS SOMETHING YOU OUGHT TO KNOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY AWKWARD MOMENT. STEVE: I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO READ THE PAPER IN THE MORNING. I WOULD LOVE TO BE A FLY ON THE WALL RIGHT NOW AT THE PRIME MINISTER'S COUNTRY RESIDENCE. PROTESTING OUR PRESIDENT WHEN THEY GIVE PRESIDENT ERDOGAN OF TURKEY A PASS WHO THAT COUNTRY. THEY ARE UPSET AT OUR PRESIDENT. LOOK, WE HAVE THE CHINESE PREMIER AND SAUDI ARABIA AND WE GAVE HIM A STATE VISIT AND THERE WERE HARDLY ANY PROTESTS AT ALL. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE IS THE LIBERAL LEFT PRESS DEMONIZE UNFORTUNATELY, QUITE A FEW PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT I HAVE TO SAY PROTEST IS FINE IN A DEMOCRACY. BUT TO BE FLYING THIS BLIMP, THIS KITE OF DONALD TRUMP OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT HOW SADIQ IS HN IS HE SA HE SADIE SADIQKHAN COULD V.A. LOUED IT I WILL NEVER KNOW. I'M ASHAMED OF THAT TODAY.
