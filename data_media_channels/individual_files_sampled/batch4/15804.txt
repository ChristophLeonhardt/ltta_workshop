we live in a day and age of 17 different genders or is a 31 or maybe it's 86 regardless of you truly wanted to go through life pretending to be a non-binary asexual gender fluid spirit unicorn hey go for it it's a free country after all but why should the taxpayer be on the hook for the elective surgery some transgender people are now demanding so there's quite a gender-bending brouhaha going on in nova scotia right now you see a transgender activist and hey that's my favorite kind of activist by the way well he's filed a human rights complaint against the Nova Scotia Department of Health Sarina Sloan White was born a man but in his quest to look more like a real woman Sarina craves breast implants and guess what folks he wants the taxpayers of Nova Scotia to pay for those Bolton's thankfully he's being denied a free ride when it comes to this surgery being rightfully told by the province that his desire to sport fake boobs is not a medical necessity yet because it's 2018 mr. Swan white has reacted with a hissy fit stomping his way over to the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission apparently a man's wish to have his very own set of c-cups is now a human right according to a CBC reports lawn white filed the human rights complaint because there's apparently a double standard in the province which is to say if a woman decides to become a man the taxpayer is indeed on the hook for breasts removal but the province will not pay for a breast addition if a man wants become a woman or at least a reasonable facsimile of one in truth salon white has a point here there is a double standard at play it's just that his remedy is at fault which is to say in my book the breast removal procedure shouldn't be paid for by the taxpayer dime either look you want to play mister or mrs. dress-up hey knock yourself out but why should the taxpayer be obliged to fund this besides if mr. Swan white were to get his breasts then how does the provinces Department of Health say no to say a natural born woman who craves a larger chest purely for cosmetic reasons or perhaps Nova Scotia should just raise taxes across the board and cater to any and all elective cosmetic surgery otherwise saying no to people might make for a human rights violation based on hurt feelings oh and it gets worse lawn White's lawyer Suzanne litt gay stated that breast implants are actually a quote medical necessity end quote if hormone therapy fails to achieve the desired results what a lack of fake boobs for a dude hoping to be a gal is somehow deemed to be a medical necessity just like someone suffering from a heart attack or just like somebody afflicted with cancer give me a break by the way let K is a lawyer at Dalhousie legal aid service so apparently Slon wife isn't paying for his legal services either god I wonder if this guy pays full freight for anything indeed what an appalling sense of entitlement there are people literally dying in Canada as they wait in line for life-saving medical procedures thanks to our overburdened health care system and this dude is going crying to a kangaroo court because he's basically too cheap to pay a private cosmetic surgery clinic to facilitate a boob job incidentally it's not stated in the CBC report if mr Swan white wants taxpayers to pay for the removal of his penis - and if that's the case does this not hurt his premise that he desperately needs fake boobs in order to become or at least look like a real female perhaps mr. song white doesn't need surgery but rather a psychological counselling hopefully the tax I won't have to pick up the tab on that one either for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
