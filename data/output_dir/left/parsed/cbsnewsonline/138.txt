AND WE ARE DISCUSSING TRADE AND 
THE EU AND LOTS OF OTHER 
THINGS. 
TREMENDOUS NUMBERS ARE COMING 
OUT ON THE UNITED STATES AND 
OUR ECONOMY IS VERY GOOD. 
PROBABLY THE BEST IT'S EVER 
BEEN. 
AND WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO MAKING 
SOME VERY GOOD TRADE DEALS. 
FAIR TRADE DEALS FOR OUR 
TAXPAYERS AND FOR OUR WORKERS 
AND OUR FARMERS AND A LOT OF 
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. 
I THINK THE EU -- WE'LL BE 
MEETING WITH THEM FAIRLY SOON. 
THEY WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN WORK 
SOMETHING OUT. 
AND IF WE WORK IT OUT IT WILL 
BE POSITIVE. 
>> IT WILL BE POSITIVE. 
BUT MR. PRIME MINISTER THANK 
YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
>> IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE. 
AND CAN I ADD TO THIS THAT THE 
>> BETWEEN THE NETHERLANDS AND 
THE UNITED STATES IS OVER 400 
YEARS OLD. 
WE ARE ALLIES, AND WE HAVE 
ALWAYS BEEN FRIENDS. 
AND OUR TALKS WILL NO DOUBT 
FOCUS ON -- AND SECURITY. 
WE ARE BOTH CONVINCED THAT AS 
LEADERS OUR PRIME TASK IS 
ESSENTIALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT 
OUR COUNTRIES ARE SAFE AND 
STABLE AND THAT OUR ECONOMY IS 
PROVIDING JOBS AND FUTURE 
GROWTH FOR OUR PEOPLE. 
AND THERE ARE SO MANY 
OPPORTUNITIES BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES AND THE 
NETHERLANDS TO DO MORE BOTH IN 
THE AREA OF SECURITY AND IN THE 
AREA OF HAVING MORE JOBS AND 
TRADE AND INVESTMENTS. 
825,000 IN A JOB IN THE U.S. 
BECAUSE OF DUTCH INVESTMENTS 
AND A QUARTER OF A MILLION 
BECAUSE U.S. INVESTMENTS IN THE 
NETHERLANDS. 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR 
DISCUSSIONS. 
>> THAT'S A GREAT HONOR. 
AND I JUST SPOKE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT ELECT OF MEXICO. 
WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION, 
ABOUT A HALF HOUR ALONG. 
WE TALKED ABOUT BORDER 
SECURITY, TRADE, NAFTA, WE 
TALKED ABOUT A SEPARATE DEAL, 
JUST MEXICO AND THE UNITED 
STATES. 
AND WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION 
AND I THINK THE RELATIONSHIP 
WILL BE A GOOD ONE. 
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
BUT I BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE 
A GOOD ONE. 
HE HAD A VERY EXCELLENT 
ELECTION. 
DID BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED. 
I TOLD HIM A NUMBER OF YEARS 
AGO WHEN I SAW HIM CAMPAIGNING 
FOR A DIFFERENT RACE, A 
DIFFERENT YEAR, SOME DAY HE'S 
GOING TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF 
MEXICO. 
SO HE REMEMBERED THAT AND IT 
TURNED OUT TO BE CORRECT. 
WE HAD A GREAT TALK IN THE 
MORNING. 
I INTERVIEWED AND MET WITH FOUR 
POTENTIAL JUSTICES OF OUR GREAT 
SUPREME COURT. 
THEY ARE OUTSTANDING PEOPLE AND 
THEY ARE REALLY INCREDIBLE 
PEOPLE IN SO MANY DIFFERENT 
WAYS, ACADEMICALLY AND IN EVERY 
OTHER WAY. 
AND I HAD A VERY INTERESTING 
MORNING. 
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF 
MEXICO, AND ALSO THE PRESIDENT 
ELECT, I THINK HE'S GOING TO 
TRY AND DO VERY HARD AND HELP 
US WITH BORDER. 
WE HAVE UNBELIEVABLY BAD BORDER 
LAWS, IMMIGRATION LAWS, THE 
WEAKEST IN THE WORLD. 
LAUGHED AT BY EVERYBODY IN THE 
WORLD. 
AND MEXICO CAN HELP US 
STRAIGHTEN OUT OUR IMMIGRATION 
LAWS. 
BUT VERY INTERESTING MY FOUR 
MEETINGS. 
I'LL BE MEETING WITH TWO OR 
THREE MORE. 
AND WE'LL MAKE A DECISION ON 
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME 
COURT, THE NEW JUSTICE. 
THAT WILL BE MADE OVER THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS, AND WE'LL BE 
ANNOUNCING IT ON MONDAY. 
I THINK THE PERSON THAT IS 
CHOSEN WILL BE OUTSTANDING. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 
I'LL BE ANNOUNCING THAT ON 
MONDAY.      
>> -- I HOPE THEY CHANGE THEIR 
WAYS. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TREATING US 
BADLY. 
AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE AT A 
DISADVANTAGE WITH THE WTO. 
AND WE'RE NOT PLANNING ANYTHING 
NOW. 
BUT IF THEY DON'T TREAT US 
PROPERLY, WE'LL BE DOING 
SOMETHING.               
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.    
>> AS YOU CAN SEE, THAT'S 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE PRIME 
MINISTER OF THE NETHERLANDS 
POST MEETING VERY SHORT PRESS 
CONFERENCE THERE. 
STILL TAKING SHOUTED QUESTIONS. 
IF ANYTHING INTERESTING COMES 
OUT OF THAT WE'LL CUT TO IT. 
AND THE PRESIDENT TOUCHED ON A 
FEW OTHER ISSUES. 
HE SAID HE HAS INTERVIEWED FOUR 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
CANDIDATES. 
PLANS ON INTERVIEWING TWO OR 
THREE MORE. 
AND WANTS TO MAKE AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS CHOICE AS 
EARLY AS THE NINTH AFTER THE 
JULY 4th HOLIDAY WHICH ANYBODY 
WHO FOLLOWS COURT PROCEEDINGS 
WHICH OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAPPEN 
VERY OFTEN. 
BUT THAT'S A VERY ACCELERATED 
TIME FRAME FOR US. 
USUALLY PRESIDENTS WILL TAKE 
MUCH LONGER. 
REMEMBER, THERE WAS A LIST OF 
POTENTIAL CANDIDATES DURING THE 
LAST TIME HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO CHOOSE SOMEONE. 
SO HE'S GOING FROM THAT LIST 
AND HAS NARROWED IT DOWN TO 
FOUR TO SIX VIMS. 
AND HE SAID HE HAD A 
CONVERSATION WITH THE NEW 
PRESIDENT-ELECT OF MEXICO. 
AND TOUCHED ON A BROAD VARIETY 
OF SUBJECTS, INCLUDING THE 
SECURITY OF THE BORDER. 
AND HE SAID HE WAS HOPING THAT 
THE NEW PRESIDENT WOULD HELP 
WITH THE BORDER. 
HE MADE AN INTERESTING COMMENT. 
HE SAID THAT MEXICO HAS VERY 
STRONG IMMIGRATION LAWS WHEREAS 
THE U.S. HAS WEAK IMMIGRATION 
LAWS THAT ARE LAUGHED AT BY THE 
REST OF THE WORLD. 
HE DIDN'T MENTION THE FACT THAT 
MOST OF THE PEOPLE COMING INTO 
THE U.S. SOUTHERN BORDER CAME 
THROUGH MEXICO FROM LATIN 
AMERICA. 
SO THEY HAVE STRONG IMMIGRATION 
LAWS BUT PEOPLE COME THROUGH 
ANYWAY. 
ALL RIGHT. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
MUCH MORE
