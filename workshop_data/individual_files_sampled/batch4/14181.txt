Justin Trudeau refuses to pull funding of Oxfam in light of the sexual abuse allegations against the international aid organization and here I thought Justin Trudeau was some sort of feminist international aid organization Oxfam is being accused of burying reports that its workers had prostituted survivors of the Darfur genocide and the survivors of the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti while the charity was working in Haiti in 2010 in 2011 their own internal investigation into allegations of aid workers using local prostitutes led to four people being fired in three others resigning including the person in charge of the Haiti relief on the ground and in 2006 former Oxfam staff alleged that prostitutes were repeatedly invited into the Oxfam housing facility in Chad for sex parties one senior member of the Oxfam team and Chad was fired for his behavior at the time Oxfam's former boss of safeguarding said teenage volunteers at UK Oxfam branches had been abused and then overseas staff had been trading aid for sex let's just say that again Oxfam's staff are alleged to have been bartering donated help medicine and food they were using Aid as currency for sex the woman making these claims Helen Evans said she reported the allegations to her Oxfam bosses who ignored her and she eventually quit Evans said that 10% of the Oxfam staff in some countries had either been sexually assaulted by their colleagues or had witnessed some form of sexual abuse now the sex scandal has prompted the resignation of the deputy head of Oxfam's UK branch actress Minnie Driver has resigned as Oxfam ambassador in protest South African Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu has resigned as well as global Oxfam ambassador according to Sky News more than 1,200 people in the UK have canceled their monthly donations the troubled charity British Prime Minister Elizabeth May has called the actions of Oxfam horrific behavior and her government has just opened an official inquiry into the charity but here at home in Canada while Canada flatly refuses to withdraw their funding and support for Oxfam and Canada's support for Oxfam is no small pittance on International Women's Day last year Justin Trudeau and International Development Minister marie-claude Bebo announced six hundred and fifty million dollars over three years to Oxfam to fund sexual reproductive health rights we talked about this before but that is the Canadian government giving over half a billion tax dollars to fund sexual health initiatives and abortions including fighting global anti-abortion laws in the developing world all dished out by Oxfam an organisation that knew about the sexual predators in their midst and did nothing more than fire them eventually International Development Canada must be fully aware by now because the news is everywhere that Oxfam staff were alleged to be taking those donations given to them by countries like Canada and trading it for sex from trafficked genocide and natural disaster survivors and yet Canada refuses to withdraw funding Minister Bebo said she received assurances from Oxfam Canada that Canadian tax dollars did not fund any projects linked to the sexual misconduct allegations Bebo told The Globe and Mail and I quote from that conversation I had with Oxfam Quebec and Oxfam Canada on their procedure or their processes I was very satisfied with what I heard I have no information that would be of concern to me so Bebo isn't concerned well I find it pretty darn concerning then it appears Oxfam knew about their problems and either ignored them as is alleged in the UK or quietly tried to sweep them under the rug I guess we're just taking the word of Oxfam now the world doesn't even know the extent of the scandal that's still unfolding day by day and even if Canadian funds didn't go directly to those tainted arms location or staff of Oxfam it's the fact that this happened in such a wide spread scale with complicity all the way up to the top it's tainted the entire organization Canada's Liberals they claim to be a feminist government they're so preening ly feminists that they claim to be creating a gender balance budget now to go along with their gender balance cabinet and the prime minister he literally will not shut up about what a feminist he is all the time now I'm not a feminist I've never claimed to be a feminist I don't particularly want to be a feminist but I hear they are supposed to care deeply about the welfare of women at least that's what they keep telling me anyway and if that's the case then why are the Liberals still funding Oxfam and why are the folks of the me2 movement though women's March and the times up army completely silent while Canada funds an organization that operated an abuse ring exploiting poor women of color in far-off places for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn Reese are you like me do you live on your phone and you expect your phone to do everything for you well then I have

story with you wherever you go you
