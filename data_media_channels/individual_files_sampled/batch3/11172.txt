several missiles have hit the center of the Afghan capital of Kabul this morning local police said the Taliban was behind the attack no injuries reported there the missiles landed in the diplomatic district of Kabul where government buildings are situated somewhere them hit the presidential palace and one reportedly struck the US embassy the assault happened as the country's president ironically was giving a holiday speech the Taliban has been increasing its military activity there lately with another assault carried out by the group only yesterday Monday Taliban fighters ambushed three buses then taking almost 200 people hostage later Afghan security forces reportedly freed nearly 150 of them the bus raid came shortly after the Afghan president had offered a ceasefire during the Muslim holiday Eid al-adha that started today Daniel Hawkins has more a three-month ceasefire proposed by President Ghani is not the first such motion in Afghanistan it probably won't be the last it has the blessing of the u.s. time for peace has a better ring to it than war on terror regardless the Taliban have firmly rejected it instead continuing a countrywide military offensive I saw my friend dying he was among 13 people including children and women who were killed during an air strike last night there is no attention from the government no facilities for the residents dead bodies are still on the roadsides I've also been injured military commanders say the truce will only benefit the us-led forces they've also been clear no peace will be possible in Afghanistan as long as the foreign occupation carries on and as coalition forces approached their 17th year of operations in the country how simple things seemed all those years ago we acted and the Taliban no longer is in power in Afghanistan which is not only good for the security of the free world it is incredibly good for the people who suffered in Afghanistan under barbaric rule a decade and a half later that Taliban controlled large swathe of territory and are able to strike its security forces and civilians almost that will Afghanistan has been a battleground for various militant groups something the u.s. views pragmatically the Taliban are fighting Isis and we encourage that because Isis needs to be destroyed the Afghan question has forced the u.s. the sway between a military solution and negotiations with the Taliban with such hot cold rhetoric from the White House it's hardly surprising the possibility of mediation has taken years to arise it's been quite a balancing act for Washington we have the Taliban willing to come to the negotiating table there's no talking to the Taliban we don't want to talk to the Taliban we're gonna finish what we have to finish I want to reinforce to the Taliban that the only path to peace and political legitimacy for them is through a negotiated settlement the Taliban trembles as they hear our approach the Taliban side even boy before the Kabul conference the Taliban cannot win their choices are to reconcile living irrelevance or die in September Taliban representatives have been invited for talks in Moscow alongside government officials bypassing the United States if successful these could become a step towards the longest ceasefire of them all a permanent solution to a decades-long cycle of violence something that today looks as distant as ever you know Daniel Hawkins there will we discuss the prospects of the talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government with investigative journalist Nicholas Davis and also political analyst intezaar Kadima the Afghan government just recently understood the crucial rule by the other superpowers in the region in Russia of course is one of the strongest country Russia can pay a pivotal role in in mediating between the Taliban and the Afghan government and everybody in Afghanistan is hoping that something good will happen after the conference in Moscow and in Russia if mediating Taliban will be also invited the Afghan government could be also a participant of the conference so there could be some more progresses in Afghanistan and because the different better that the negotiation in the interaction between the Afghan government in Taliban is just on the very fast beat the Taliban have obviously on their side have concluded that you know they need to apply more pressure to force the u.s. to talk to them in a sense it's ironic because you know the US have always talked about applying enough military pressure to bring the Taliban to negotiations to the peace table that has always been the official US policy but in fact it's the Taliban who were doing that and and probably have more chance of success you
