00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
we had a small group national security
meeting today with the president and the

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:12,090
vice president about the latest
provocation on the Korean Peninsula

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,350
we have many military options and
president wanted to be briefed on each

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,380
one of them we made clear that we have
the ability to defend ourselves and our

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:29,070
allies South Korea and Japan from any
attack and our commitments among the

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,800
Allies are ironclad any threat to the
United States or its territories

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,910
including Guam or our allies will be met

United Nations Security Council's
unified voice all members unanimously

10
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,660
agreed on the threat North Korea poses
and they remain unanimous and their

11
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,110
commitment to the denuclearization of
the Korean Peninsula because we are not

12
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,990
looking to the total annihilation of a
country namely North Korea but as I said

13
00:01:09,990 --> 00:00:00,000
we have many options to do so thank you
very much Leighton gentlemen
