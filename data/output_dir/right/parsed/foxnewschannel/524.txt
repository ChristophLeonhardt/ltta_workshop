EVERY SECOND.
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
ALSO, CHRISITINE BLASEY FORD'S
LEGAL TEAM RELEASING THE RESULTS
legal team releasing the results
OF A POLYGRAPH TEST SHE
TOOK IN AUGUST.
THE FORMER FBI AGENT WHO
ADMINISTER THAT POLYGRAPH TEST
IS HERE TO DESCRIBE THAT SESSION
AND TELL US WHAT FORD TOLD HIM.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH THOSE.
LET ME ASK YOU A COUPLE OF
THINGS.
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS AS 1995.
I UNDERSTAND HE'S MET ABOUT AN
HOUR AND A HALF TO TWO HOURS
WITH DR. FORD IN THIS PROCESS.
YOU ONLY ASK GENERAL QUESTIONS.
WE'LL GET TO THAT.
PART OF IT WAS GETTING A WRITTEN
STATEMENT, WE CAN PUT UP HER
FOLKS.
YOU ALSO DID AN INTERVIEW WITH
HER ABOUT ALL OF THESE
ALLEGATIONS BEFORE YOU
ADMINISTER THE TEST.
FIRST OF ALL, HOW WERE YOU
APPROACHED ABOUT THE ATTACHED?
HOW DOES THAT WORK, WHO PAID FOR
IT?
>> BELIEVE IT OR NOT, MONDAY
NIGHT, AUGUST 6, I GOT A CALL
FROM DEBRA KATZ, I HAD DONE SOME
WORK FOR THEM IN THE PAST, I
ASKED HIM I THINK EXECUTIVE
POLYGRAPH TRACKS THE NEXT DAY, I
SAID I COULD DO IT LATER IN THE
AFTERNOON, THEY HAD A CLIENT HE
WAS IN FOR OUT OF TOWN, THAT WAS
LEAVING EARLY IN THE
AFTERNOON.
ANYWAY I COULD REARRANGE MY
SCHEDULE.
I WAS ABLE TO REARRANGE MY
SCHEDULE FOR THE NEXT DAY, CALL
THEM BACK, AND I SAID I COULD DO
IT THE NEXT MORNING COME OF THAT
IS WHEN THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THE
FACT THEY HAD A CLIENT WHO WAS
MAKING ALLEGATIONS THAT BACK IN
HIGH SCHOOL THAT SHE WAS
ASSAULTED BY BRETT KAVANAUGH.
WE DISCUSSED THE DETAILS THAT
NIGHT.
WE DISCUSSED THE QUESTIONS THAT
WE BOTH THOUGHT WERE APPROPRIATE
TO ASK ANY SITUATIONS.
I'VE RUN IS KIND OF TESTS BEFORE
WITH VICTIMS AND NORMALLY WHAT
WE'LL HAVE THEM DO IS WRITE
OUT A STATEMENT ABOUT THE FACTS.
MY INTRODUCTION TO THIS CASE WAS
12 HOURS BEFORE I CONDUCTED THE
POLYGRAPH.
>> Shannon: DOES THE WORK THAT
HER LAW FORM PAYS FOR THE
SERVICES?
>> THAT IS JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO MAINTAIN THAT ATTORNEY-CLIENT
PRIVILEGE.
>> Shannon: SHE, IN ADDITION
TO PROVIDING YOU WHAT WRITTEN
STATEMENT, IT TRACKS WITH THE
FACTS WE HEARD PUBLICLY, YOU
SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME WITH
HER GIVING AN ADDITIONAL
INTERVIEW BEFORE YOU GOT TO THE
PART WHERE YOU ASK FURTHER
QUESTIONS.
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A FEW OF
THE THINGS THAT WERE IN YOUR
SUMMARY.
IN THE SUMMATION AT ONE POINT,
YOU SAY SHE STATES MARK WAS
LAUGHING, AND COAXING KAVANAUGH
ON.
A PERIOD WHERE SHE SAYS
KAVANAUGH WAS ON TOP OF HER.
SHE RECALLS MAKING EYE CONTACT
WITH MARK AND THINKING HE MAY
HELP HER.
DID SHE EXPLAIN THAT THE MORE
SHE FELT -- THROUGH MOST OF HER
ACCOUNT, SHE WAS A BAD ACTOR.
IS THERE A REASON SHE FELT LIKE
MAKING CONTACT WITH HIM IN SOME
WAY WOULD HELP HER?
>> MY UNDERSTANDING -- AGAIN,
IT'S JUST TALKING WITH HER, I
THINK WHEN SHE SAID SHE MADE EYE
CONTACT, SHE THOUGHT
LEGITIMATELY MAYBE HE -- I THINK
SHE SAID AT SOME POINT, I THINK
HE WAS CONFLICTED.
I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WAS GOING TO
TRY TO HELP ME.
WHEN YOU DO YOUR INTERVIEW
BEFORE THE POLYGRAPH, ON THE
VICTIM, YOU DON'T ASK A LOT OF
FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS.
IT'S KIND OF A HEINOUS THING
THAT'S HAPPENED.
THAT THEY ARE ALLEGING.
SHE WAS INTERVIEWED IN DEPTH THE
DAY BEFORE BY LISA AND DEBBIE
I'M ASSUMING, AND SO YOU WANT TO
GET THE GENERAL FACTS.
TO CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND
PROD, YOU DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO
GET TOO EMOTIONAL, ESPECIALLY A
VICTIM.
WHEN YOU ASK THAT QUESTION, A
GOOD QUESTION, NO, I JUST LET
HER MATTER.
>> Shannon: ON A COUPLE OF
OCCASIONS, MARK WOULD JUMP ON
THE BED.
THE LAST TIME HE DID THIS, ALL
THREE BECAME SEPARATED AND SHE
WAS ABLE TO GET FREE AND WENT TO
THE BATHROOM.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTRIGUED BY
THIS.
DID SHE SAY THAT HE WAS PILING
ONTO THE TWO OF THEM, JUMPING ON
THE BED SEPARATELY, DID YOU GET
ANY INDICATION?
>> I THINK AT ONE POINT SHE TOLD
ME DURING THE INTERVIEW THAT HE
WOULD JUMP ON THE BED AND
SOMETIMES -- I THINK THE PHRASE
SHE USED WAS HIT EACH OTHER A
LITTLE BIT.
THEN HE WOULD JUMP OFF.
>> Shannon: HE AND BRETT?
>> EXACTLY.
THEN A THIRD TIME APPARENTLY HE
JUMPED ON THE BED, IT CAUSED A
SEPARATION, AS SHE DESCRIBED, IN
THE PILE, WHICH SHE SAID, I
DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS MY STRENGTH
THAT ENABLED ME TO GET OFF OR I
WAS FREE AND THEY WERE SO
INEBRIATED THAT I WAS ABLE TO GO
INTO THE BATHROOM AND LOCKED THE
DOOR.
>> Shannon: THERE WAS
SOMETHING GOING ON BETWEEN BRETT
AND MARK THAT MADE -- HORSEPLAY?
>> I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS
HORSEPLAY.
>> Shannon: SHE DESCRIBES THEY
WERE LAUGHING.
SHE FELT IN FEAR FOR HER LIFE.
THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT
AFTER SHE PUT TOGETHER THE
STATEMENT THAT YOU INTERVIEWED
HERE, THESE ARE VERTICAL
QUESTIONS.
IS ANY PART OF YOUR STATEMENT
FALLS?
SHE SAID NO.
DID YOU MAKE UP ANY PART OF YOUR
STATEMENT?
HER ANSWER WAS NO.
I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT
POLYGRAPH TESTS BUT TO ME
READING THIS FROM THE OUTSIDE IT
SEEMS THAT I WOULD EXPECT MANY
MORE QUESTIONS.
IS THIS STANDARD YOU JUST HAVE
THE TWO?
>> IT IS.
WHEN YOU DO -- VERY RARE AND
LAW ENFORCEMENT, I SPEND MOST OF
MY CAREER IN WORKING WITH THE
FBI.
YOU DON'T NORMALLY GIVE
POLYGRAPH TESTS TO VICTIMS.
YOU REPRESENT VICTIMS.
YOU BELIEVE THEM UNLESS YOU HAVE
SOME CORROBORATING EVIDENCE THAT
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THESE
PERSONS ALLEGATIONS THAT YOU
FOUND SOME -- THAT YOU DON'T
BELIEVE.
WHEN YOU DO POLYGRAPH, THE MOST
VALID POLYGRAPH TEST, SHANNON,
IS WHAT WE CALL A SPECIFIC ISSUE
POLYGRAPH.
IT'S THIS YOU FACE ALL THE MY
POLYGRAPH EXAMINATION,
ADDRESSING ONE ISSUE.
THE ONE ISSUE HERE IS HER
STATEMENT.
YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT ONE
ISSUE ONLY ASKING TWO QUESTIONS.
THE PROTOCOL THAT I FOLLOW,
PEOPLE THINK I WILL COME IN AND
TAKE A POLYGRAPH COP ASKED ME
TEN QUESTIONS.
>> Shannon: WAS A BRETT
KAVANAUGH?
>> EXACTLY.
>> Shannon: YOU JUST LOOK AT
THE OVERALL STATEMENT.
>> YOU ASK TWO QUESTIONS AND
THAT IS THE MOST VALIDATING
POLYGRAPH.
>> Shannon: IS IT POSSIBLE FOR
SOMEONE TO PASS A POLYGRAPH TEST
BASED ON THE CONVICTION THAT
