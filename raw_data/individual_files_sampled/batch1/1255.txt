the popular Filipino news website is facing mounting legal pressure with securities exchange commission who walks through initiation of revenue received the subpoena Burmese of cyber libelous boss says a war of attrition is on the way what she and her colleagues are determined to win we begin in the Philippines and a popular online news site rap ler that's long been a thorn in the side of president rodrigo duterte rattlers criticism of Duterte signature policy his war on drugs and its investigations into his personal wealth have not gone down well with the president Duterte has long accused rap ler of being run by americans which would be illegal under filipino law the site now faces a possible shutdown over that allegation rapper says this is pure politicization of the press that the president now calls the shots when it comes to media regulation since coming to power in 2016 Rodrigo Duterte has made thinly veiled threats against journalists and hit them with accusations of fake news but this official move against trappler takes the conflict to another level rattler vows to take the case to the Supreme Court if it has to and should that happen we're sure to learn a lot about the media politics and power in the age of duty a our starting point this week is Manila why are we targeted because we're journalists who ask tough questions we've done investigative reports on key facets of this administration starting with the drug war of President Duterte and the online social media propaganda machine and how that forms the bedrock of disinformation in this country that really is crippling democracy what we're going to do is to challenge it and we will be challenging this take every legal remedy that is possible take it all the way up to the Supreme Court and we're also taking it to the people by fighting the case in the court of public opinion rap ler has posted videos on its own site explaining its side of the legal story there's also an FAQ section there dedicated to the case its editors have used news conferences this is harassment peace and freedom of the press demonstrations again to get the word out and they have turned to their colleagues in mainstream news outlets channels like abs-cbn and GMA to report on the story as well those outlets might given the kind of precedent this case could set in the Philippines they're trying to test the waters if nobody will complain or protest about what they're doing with Raptor they would go ahead with the other news organizations and in fact the president has come out with speeches against the largest Daily News branch and inquired Inquirer and he has also lashed out against the two biggest views organizations on TV on abs-cbn channel do it Jamie 7news named Vampira president that has continued to lash out against any kind of use organization that exposes any kind of a wrongdoing in his government life you if we allow rapper to go down sooner or later everyone's going down we cannot afford that and we will not allow that we've been through the Marcos dictatorship and he shut down all media and and had on these mouthpieces is propaganda mouthpieces and we do not want their planet because press freedom is is not even ours it belongs to the people and you take away press freedom you take away people's right to information and that's very basic so you lose democracy that way the government's case against trappler is a financial one like many companies in the philippines rapper uses PDRs philippine Depositary Receipts as a vehicle to secure foreign funding PDRs give investors a slice of the profits if the company makes money but unlike shares no control of that company with the philippines financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC is asserting is that one of rappers PDR investors the Omidyar group run by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar does have a measure of control over things like the company's makeup or bylaws there by breaching Filipino law which forbids foreign control of media companies Harry Roque is a spokesperson for President Duterte rap ler is about money it is not about freedom of the press what Robert did was an ingenious fundraising scheme that resulted in controlled by a foreign entity of a media corporation because the business of spreading information is vested with national interests it should only be owned by Filipinos but the thing is even the SEC recognizes PDRs not as ownership but as investment and it's not only rapper the other networks and PD and one very telling thing too is the fact that the Solicitor General who is basically the governance lawyer asked SEC to act on the complaint against Raptor so it's basically government telling the Securities and Exchange Commission to do something about Raptor so that alone is a very blatant government intervention you have to look at the SEC decision in context philippine media has been under attack online for more than a year and a half and just last july you tear ten targeted rattler and then a few days after the SEC decision I received a cyber libel case for a 2012 article that was published before the cyber libel law was actually passed the government says this is pure coincidence but when coincidences happen too frequently they form patterns and the patterns very clear the trappler and not a more conventional news outlet has provoked this kind of response from the authorities is a measure of just how far the site has come in the six years since its launch and the importance now attached to alternative news sources in the Philippines it's fairly inovative because this is the first time we have a purely online news organization it did not have a print version it doesn't have a broadcast satellite facility so this is the first time that you have a purely used online site and a big portion of the shares are owned by journalists and reporters themselves so as an innovative project you would like to have more rappers Rodrigo Duterte came to power in mid-2016 launching his war on drugs and drug users the government puts the number of extra judicial killings at 4,000 human rights groups say it's more like 12,000 rapper was among the news outlets critical of the carnage and the absence of due process that displeased a president who does not take kindly to second-guessing and who used last year's State of the Union address to take issue with rattler and its ownership rapper has also made enemies in the Filipino blogosphere president Duterte has legions of online backers the self-described dds diehard Duterte supporters some of whom can be quite vicious posting the home addresses of journalists they disapprove of threatening them and trying to undermine the work of sites like rap ler that criticized Duterte or his policies we did a whole series of this in October 2016 that was what made us a target of the propaganda machine as soon as we published that story we came under attack I was getting eight messages great messages death threats an average of 90 hate messages per hour our best defense was to understand it so we collected the data and we processed it we showed that 26 fake accounts can actually ripple and influence up to 3 million other accounts by April 2017 the key content creators in that propaganda machine were appointed the government its online state-sponsored hate and it is meant to silence dissent it is meant to silence criticism as poisonous as the rhetoric in the blogosphere can be the government's case against trappler based on those PDRs seems downright pedantic it's worth reiterating Rattler is not the only news outlet in the philippines that uses PDRs as a source of financing the country's two biggest television networks abs-cbn and GMA used them as well no prizes for guessing where this story is going president Authority while he says that he's not sending armies applause other news organizations he's trying to kill them slowly constricting their economic funding their sources of funding so this is that the worst the worst is yet to come you
