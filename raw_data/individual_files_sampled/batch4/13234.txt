they are real good pair of thieves calm / knowles now that you have that image in your head we are not gonna stop talking about sex all day now that it's in there it's all anybody wants to talk about it so Lee Anne Hathaway wants to talk about so all the gutter Democrats want to talk about is sex sex sex so I I'm sorry I'm getting breaking I'm just one second getting breaking news right now yes we are hearing reports that Brett Kavanaugh is a secret super Nazi we're hearing reports they seem credible they're credible reports because somebody said it so it's got to be credible because someone said it he is a super-secret Nazi he's unfit for the Supreme Court that's it I guess we're going to change our show today it was all about would be very good on the Supreme Court but he's a super-secret Nazi because there's a credible allegation because it's credible because someone said it's credible so it's credible it's credible it's not credible none of these are credible so they're saying that Brett Kavanaugh this is the allegation I'm sure you've seen this everywhere but it's probably been all insinuation Zand what did he do this or that they're trying to make it out like he raped a woman or something the allegation is that 35 years ago when Brett Kavanaugh was 17 and was drunk at a party he groped another teenage girl who was also drunk and then he was like you know kind of on top of her on a bed and then she got away and then and that's it that's the allegation that's the whole thing shit they don't mention where the party was when when really the party was what the circumstances were the story's changing so now the Democrats are using this 11th hour allegation to try to stop the Cavanaugh hearing these allegations are not credible period punto basta no more fini they're not credible that you hear why are they not credible because of all the context surrounding them they first of all because they came up at the 11th hour so not during the hearings not when Bret Kevin I could have answered for himself now when we could have actually investigated this right before the vote these come up the allegations were brought to Dianne Feinstein she sat on them why did she sit on them one because she probably didn't believe them too because she knew they could be discredited three because she wanted to spring this at the last second for Democrats to try to undo a nomination which is certainly going to go through it certainly should go through so they do that why else are the allegations not credible because they were made for the first time publicly like five minutes ago they they're about an event that happened ostensibly 35 years ago and the first time they were ever mentioned publicly in the public space against a public figure who's been a public figure for a long time was about five minutes ago right at the very end when they were about to confirm him for the Supreme Court so why else are these allegations not credible well some other evidence that these might not be is that the woman who made them is a long time left-wing activist Democrat activist donates to Democrat causes volunteers her time puts her name on petitions to support the Democrat Party is an activist against the Trump administration okay now none of that proves that this didn't happen I'm not saying with 100% certainty this didn't happen I'm not saying with 100% certainty that Brett Kavanaugh isn't a super secret Nazi or that Dianne Feinstein is into super secret Nazi I don't you know you can't I can't prove a negative I can't prove something that allegedly happened 35 years ago which is unverifiable and unfalsifiable but these are not credible allegations the woman who's making these allegations is christine Blasi ford the first time she had mentioned this at all period was in 2012 so six years ago and she mentioned it to her psychiatrist or psychologist or whatever and the therapist that she was talking to took down the notes and her story has radically changed since that time so at the time she said that there were four men who were in the room when she was assaulted allegedly assaulted now that's gone down to two men who were in the room allegedly when she was assaulted which is Brett Kavanaugh and Mark judge who's a conservative writer okay that's a pretty big discrepancy that's the there were 100% more people when she recalled this in 2012 but why did it take so long why did it take so long for to mention it to anybody she didn't mention it to any friends at the time she didn't mention it to any friends in 2006 when Brett Kavanaugh became a judge she didn't mention it until 2012 until six years after that and until six years ago to mention anything about this and at that time she didn't name Brett Kavanaugh if she really thought that there was a would-be rapists sitting on the federal courts don't you think she would have named him in 2012 you would think so now you might say why would she lie why would someone bring up a false accusation I don't know I couldn't tell you and I'm not saying she's lying but I do know that people make false accusations all the time how many of these alleged cases of rape on campus have been proven to be hoaxes it's all the way since the Duke Lacrosse case all the way up through recent years a number of them do people lie I don't know I couldn't tell you ask them we also know that she brought this up in a session of marriage counseling so I'm not not to denigrate anybody who has mental health issues who has psychiatric issues but she she is in a mental health counseling she is discussing this with her therapist and we have to remember that memory is very very unreliable I'm not saying this woman is lying I don't know if she's lying or not but it it is perfectly plausible that she is remembering something that did not happen or did not happen the way that she thinks it happened memories change all the time they change a pretty short order by the way they change between you know over the course of a few weeks or over the course of a few months certainly over the course of several decades there's an irony here too though by the way because even if these it let's let's say that all of the allegations are true I don't think they're true I don't think there's any evidence that they're true but let's say that they were the same people now who are saying that we need to tar and feather Brett Kavanaugh or the very same people who were always pushing for lenient punishments against teenagers who there there's a movement now on the left to create another sort of juvenile court for people who were 20 21 years old because they say oh those poor kids their brains haven't developed yet they can't be held responsible for crimes that they've committed teenagers can't be held responsible for crimes they've committed they should be processed separately it shouldn't be healthy so all of those people the ones crying for criminal justice reform even for adults they're the ones who are now saying Brett Kavanaugh allegedly groped a girl when he was 17 so now his life has to be over it's absurd but let's say that it were true and let's say that this woman is being earnest this really happened to her it really had some effect on her life even though she didn't mention it for 30 years let's say all of that is true she would be making allegations worthy of belief if she had made them at any other time but she didn't and you don't get to do that you don't get to do that you don't get to derail a guy who has an unimpeachable career who has no similar allegations made against him ever at any point you don't get to derail his career at the very last moment just cuz just because you said so you don't get to if all of this happened and you you have that right to go out there and nail him you forfeited that right when you didn't do it earlier when you didn't do it in 2006 when he became a judge when you didn't do it when he was circulated as a potential Supreme Court pet when you didn't do it until the very last second you lose that credibility and the Democrats obviously have no credibility here if they really believed that this were an issue that would have brought it up when they first heard about it they didn't they sent it over to the FBI to investigate the FBI dismissed it they wouldn't look into it they said it was not worthy of investigating so what we have now is another high-tech lynching they did this to Clarence Thomas in the early 90s here is Joe Biden actually was chairing that committee here is what they did to to Clarence Thomas when he was up for the nomination they said that he sexually harassed his colleague even though the colleague had followed him from job to job she said it was some awful example of sexual harassment and here is how Clarence Thomas put an end to the argument committee will please come to order Jerry you like this senator I would like to start by saying unequivocally uncatted Oracle II that I deny each and every single allegation against me today this is a case in which this sleaze this dirt was searched for by staffers of members of this committee was then leaked to the media and this committee and this body validated it and displayed it at primetime over our entire nation this is a circus it's a national disgrace and from my standpoint as a black American as far as I'm concerned it is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves to do for themselves to have different ideas and it is a message that unless you count to an old order this is what will happen to you you will be lynched destroyed caricatured by a committee of the u.s. US Senate rather than hung from a tree very powerful stuff from Clarence Thomas guess what happened after that by the way they voted for him and it confirmed him it's great to is you have Joe Biden just the least genuine person in America the ly sincere human being in America he's their presiding over the hearings you mm-hmm and then the minute that Clarence Thomas says from my view this is a this is a high-tech lynching you just see Biden's head go down he's like Oh get me out of here duck and cover can I leave so the the reason that this worked so well one is very powerful stuff the allegations against Justice Thomas were frivolous and one of the reasons this worked is because Thomas was able to turn the identity politics of the left against them so he turned their own argument against them Brett Kavanaugh doesn't have the ability to do that I say this is a high-tech lynching for privileged white men who went to Georgetown Prep not gonna land not gonna play so we don't know how he's going to answer this already all the usual suspects are saying we can't vote for him we need to hear more Jeff Flake who's on the Judiciary Committee said oh I don't think I can vote for him mm-hmm I'm gonna go donate to Democrats in Alabama mmm mmm Jeff Flake just horrific what breaking news once again Jeff Flake proves these are the worst so what is going to happen we don't know it seems that he'll still get through these allegations are so absurd you own if you wrote a satire of this you couldn't write a more frivolous way of undoing the Cavanaugh nomination then 35 years ago when he was a teenager he groped me and he says no I didn't and they said well there's no proof at all because I only brought it up three seconds ago but please don't become a judge that's that's their argument it's not I hope it's not going to work but this does bring up another point which is I cannot wait for the Democrats next judge nomination I can't wait oh is that going to be good because they keep doing it to us they keep digging up this sleaze in the dirt and I can't wait for their next one because I think I'm not out of anger not out of my temper but I think the Democrats need to learn a lesson and I feel real sorry for whoever that next judicial nominee is from Democrats I feel real sorry because it's gonna get real real ugly before we get to why that is the case why it is it would be very wrong to consider these allegations credible let me invite you into my bedroom what did I tell you I told you there's gonna be a lot of boudoir talk today because I've got to tell you about purple mattress oh how I love purple mattress how did you sleep last night did you spend the night tossing and turning not me I sleep like a baby why is that it all changed after purple mattress purple is categorically different from other mattresses you're thinking oh the memory foam oh the springs oh this is totally different purple mattress is designed by rocket scientists it uses

at these allegations these eleventh-hour allegations I think look nobody wants to tell an accuser that they're not going to believe her even though you know sometimes people make false accusations I'm not saying that's what this woman is doing people feel all we want to say is oh well who knows we have to delay we have to hear this out we don't have to hear this out we don't if we were going to hear this out we should have heard this out two months ago we do not we are we are under no obligation to hear this out but the the timing all of the context around this makes it stink to high heaven as a political dirty trick it is bad for our politics for us to take this seriously to even consider taking this seriously people if people have genuine grievances if people have genuinely been hurt or attacked or whatever that should be aired we should investigate all of that it is so awful for our politics to just smear good people smear them it discourages good people from going into public service first of all everybody is tarnished everyone's done bad things you know it Eve but even if you haven't done bad things even if you've got as unimpeachable record as judge Cavanaugh what this now tells you is you're gonna get smeared either way they're gonna they're gonna go into your distant distant past and either find something exaggerate something or make something up whole cloth imagine how squeaky-clean you've got to be for the best shot for Democrats is to go back to when you were seventeen and either make something up or even find something that has a kernel of truth to it which I don't think this does imagine that it discourages good people out of politics it's so below or caliber as a country and below our politics we should ignore it we should totally ignore it and the next time someone ever wants to make an allegation like this again against another judicial nominee do it do it early do it when there's time for people to defend themselves when there's time to investigate if you're not going to do that if you're not going to leave time to investigate if you're not going to leave time for people to have to be treated fairly then the accusation is not worthy of even investigating so moving on speaking of other crazy things crazy ideology that leads to political hysteria Saturn Anne Hathaway was speaking at the Human Rights Campaign gala the Human Rights Campaign is a gay lobbying organization they're the one with the equal sign and she was speaking at their gala and she I think this was the most incoherent oration I've ever heard but there are a lot of interesting kernels in here for what our culture and our politics means right now take it away Ann the exception of being a cisgender male everything about how I was born has put me at the current center of a damaging and widely accepted myth that myth is that gayness orbits around the straightness transgender orbits around cisgender and that all races orbit around whiteness so she's talking about a myth she's talking about this this awful foundational myth and then she goes on to create her own myth and and what she's saying is that gayness orbits around straightness what does that mean what does that picture really mean I think what she's actually saying is that the gayness is a little bit abnormal and straightness is the normal statistically speaking biologically speaking most people are straight or our reproductive systems seem to be designed for a man and a woman to you know head over to a purple mattress and do whatever they're going to do and that other other more creative sexualities or a little abnormal certainly that's the case but she's saying that isn't the case it's all exactly the same it's all exactly equally normal how about transgenderism she's saying we have this crazy idea that if you're a man that you should think that you're a man instead of thinking me or a woman that it's abnormal if you're a man to think that you're a woman of course that's abnormal of course that's ignore and then she says that we have this pernicious belief that of other races orbit around whiteness I don't really know what that means I suppose being of a different race in a country where they're founded on a race then I guess that would make sense you know if you're if you're a Kenyan guy who's living in Norway that might be a little abnormal because Norway isn't full of Kenyans it's full of Norwegians so if you're a Kenyan there you're you're not the common type of person okay fine fair enough that isn't the case in America though which has every sort of color every sort of race all sorts of people that doesn't seem like there's one normal person in America certainly not Anne Hathaway she's definitely not a normal person in America so she's talking about this myth but did you see even at the top she said I but you know I have all of this privilege maiya colpa Mia culpa Mia culpa at least I'm not a man who thinks he's a man but I'm still bad I'm bad then she she goes on that is with us from birth and it is a myth that keeps money and power in the hands of the few instead of being invested in the lives of the free so she's getting raucous applause she sounds like she's giving a real speech she said it this this myth this pernicious lie that were founded on keeps money in the hands of the few and out of the hands of the free so she's saying there's a dichotomy between the few and the free but her entire speech is talking about how the majority of people are actually enslaved to these privileged people so I don't see how how are they free I thought previously you were just saying that it's those awful privileged white straight people who think they're their own biological sex those are the free ones and everyone else isn't free so she's using language really really loosely here and she's saying that to distill it in just normal clear language she's saying that straight people make more money than gay people but that isn't true it just simply isn't true there was a study that came out from the National Health Interview Survey it came out of these economists at Vanderbilt University showed that gay men actually earned 10% more than straight men that's just earnings to say nothing of wealth so even on that point that it keeps some money out of the hands of this and that and this and that isn't true actually if you're gay you that gives you a certain privilege that allows you to earn more money according to these surveys and according to the premises of this ideology but it doesn't matter because the ideology of the human rights campaign of the equal sign of Hollywood of the popular culture that is the lie she goes on equality authentic equality doesn't prioritize sexual orientation it doesn't put any one gender or race at the center it doesn't erase our identities either what it does do is centralize love and when love is fully centralized every door opens for everybody you know man when you just you just got a really centralized it man and then the chakras man you know what she has just said contradicts her first premise she has said that what what this wonderful movement is going to do is centralize love but in the first premise she said the the problem that we have is that we have love being centralized and then other sorts of love orbiting around it where she said well this is central and then other things are orbiting around it so the centralization of love seems to be the problem actually what Anne should be arguing for in her speech is the decentralization of love right that it's not just straight love that matters it's not just trans love or cisgender love whatever crazy language she's gonna make up it should be arguing for decentralization but this argument that she's making doesn't make a whole lot of sense if she's just if that love wins hashtag love wins it's that Anthony Kennedy and obergefell saying we have a right to intimacy we have a right to love you say that sounds that has the sound of poetry to it but what does it really mean what she's just said means nothing it contradicts the very arguments she's been making but then if you were confused by her abstractions don't worry she explains why you were confused by her abstractions now I know I'm speaking in abstractions and that there is privilege embedded in my ability to do so their their abstraction privilege we now have abstraction per as a privilege apparently that Anne Hathaway does not possess but a because she's not doing abstraction very well but I love this point she's talking about abstraction privilege there really is abstraction privilege that's true it's called consciousness it's called being a human that is our privilege I agree we have a privilege over the dogs and the cows and the kittens and the Apes we do we have the ability for abstract thinking we have the ability for a recursive language we have the ability to be conscious and think and reflect upon our own circumstances we have the ability to match intellect and will that is a privilege but that is not a privilege only for straight people or only for white people or only for people who think that they are the biological sex that they are or that isn't that's what we have as humans that is the essential Equality of humans that is why we are all children of God because we are all endowed by our Creator with that consciousness with that ability to know ourselves to know our world and to know our Creator a wonderful point that she is totally undercutting by the argument that she thinks she is making and then she turns that self flagellation up to eleven here we go in of this community and rejects the myth of their own unworthiness and more importantly the myth that they need others to be worth less in order for them to be worth more the walls built in fear will crumble they will disintegrate the old world will shatter and the pieces that no longer serve will melt a new world will emerge forge from this community from there sighs from your seismic imperative message that love is love I need a lot more if I'm gonna understand that one I'm gonna need that a lot more Kofi Fae in the old burner if I'm gonna get that she ends with love is love because that is the truism and the platitude that this is all based on love is love but then in that first part she constructs an abominable world and it's not that she's first making is she's the first to make this argument people have made this argument before it goes back a long long time she talks about how we need to reject the fact that we're not worthy that we're imperfect you hear this all the time I heard this from my Panda Express a fortune cookie the other day it said you are perfect the way that you are but you're not you're not perfect the way that you are I don't say that to be mean I say that actually is a moment of compassion because if you think that you're perfect the way that you are you're good you're quickly going to find out that you're not and you'll be left with despair it is a much more hopeful and truthful understanding of the world that we are not perfect the way that we are we all know this even Brett Kavanaugh who's pretty unimpeachable I'm sure he tells a lie every now and again or he you know cut somebody off in traffic or something I don't know we're all we're all imperfect we're all fallen people and what this movement is saying what Anne Hathaway is saying what the Human Rights Campaign is saying with the equal sign with the with the promotion of Pride Week is that we should be proud of ourselves we shouldn't be aware of our own unworthiness she also says this is kind of ironic she says we shouldn't have to put other people down to build ourselves up she just spent a whole speech putting down white people straight people people who think that they are the biological sex that they are she's putting down people throughout the whole thing and spouting off a bunch of lies and she says but we shouldn't do that this is Democrats do this all the time they're doing it in the Cavanaugh hearings they're doing it certainly in the Trump administration we'll get to that in a second and then she says when she's speaking at her most theological her most apocalyptic she says we're going to shatter this world we're going to create a new world we're not going to accept things the way that they are we are going to create a whole new world and you hear Democrats have been saying this for 50 years they have been quoting George Bernard Shaw's played back to Methuselah you heard the Kennedys say this all of the Kennedys I think in various speeches said some people look at the world and ask why some people look at things that are and asked why I look at things that never were and ask why not I dream of things that never were and ask why not and they're quoting this as though this were some great wonderful speech it's not they are quoting George Bernard Shaw's back to Methuselah but specifically they are quoting the serpent in the garden tempting Eve the impact Methuselah that is what that line does say some people look at things in our and asked why I dream of things that never were and ask why not that is the language of Satan because reality is a beautiful thing life is a comedy it's the greatest story ever told it's a grand comedy it's a as horace walpole says life is a comedy to the man who thinks and a tragedy to the person who feels some people want to get out of the world of reality they're afraid of it they run away from reality so they drugged themselves up or they drink too much or they lose themselves into fantasies and fairy tales but reality is a beautiful thing you should confront reality and not try to destroy the world and create a new world on top of it that is not not a strategy for success but the left abuses language in this way all the time it sounds so compassionate does love is love love is love this is the same thing with these Cavanagh hearings so I think we're all tempted because we're emotionally manipulated by certain people and certain political programs to feel us to lean until this line I love it love is love love is love but love that is not grounded in truth that is not grounded in reality that actually is Anne Hathaway says is opposed to reality that isn't love that sentimentality and sentimentality is an awful thing sentimentality can be used and abused it's saccharine it's sick it will leave you unsatisfied and it can be twisted for very bad things very unreal things because it's opposed to the very nature of reality the mainstream media have been twisting language on and on again our pals at the Media Research Center have just analyzed a study of this they have found the words that the mainstream media had been used most frequently to describe President Trump what do you think handsome competent courageous is that were there in you know not quite not quite the words that the mainstream media been using to describe Trump most often are angry furious fuming outraged venting infuriated livid enraged and seething those are the words that they're using most frequently to refer to trying the problem more than he or the or him you know Donald they they're using those adjectives to describe him and it creates a picture in our mind of this guy who's totally unbalanced who's insane who's lost his mind and yet when we see President Trump speaking when we see his agenda in action when we see how much he's accomplished in a very short period of time it really butts up against that doesn't it when you see that you think wait is it that doesn't seem like a guy who's not in control of his emotions and hathaway it might not be in control of her emotions but Donald Trump certainly seems like he is people who can't control their passions don't accomplish very much they can't because they're always lost in a torrent of passion and emotion Donald Trump's accomplished a lot a lot on the economy a lot on Foreign Affairs obviously the judges I think he's got a record number of judges through oh he's been accomplishing so much he's accomplished a lot in his life this is not a guy who is led around aimlessly by passion but the media want to pretend that he is and they're also trying to create this image that he he can't he can't control his own thinking that he's a childish that he's immature John Kerry former Secretary of State and the former star of deputy dog was on Bill Maher show last week here is how he described Donald Trump he is he really is the rare combination of a eight-year-old boy I mean he's got the maturity of an eight-year-old boy with the insecurities of a teenage girl now imagine if Donald Trump had said that about John Kerry what would the mainstream media if Donald Trump came at me said look John Kerry okay he's got the maturity of an eight-year-old boy okay and he's he's got the insecurities frankly of a teenage girl okay if he had said that it would be headline news what this is awful he's defacing the office of president blah blah blah but because John Kerry sounds like Thurston Howell the third and he goes on Bill Maher sure he says well frankly son here's my conundrum what was that John mmmmm-hmmmm can someone pry open John Kerry's locked jaw please rate your old boy because he does it like that because he wears the suit so nicely but it has his tie all the way up to his neck then people take him always so serious oh no that's that's that's how respectful responsible people behave that's how mature states when we have unlike Trump they're saying the same thing they're saying exactly the same thing and it's not just John Kerry here's Joe Biden doing doing precisely the same thing there are small percentage of American people virulent people some of them the dregs of society dregs of society dregs of soften people dregs of society he's talking about Trump supporters and actually at the Human Rights Campaign the same thing that a in Hathaway was speaking at he's talking about half of the country's talking about Trump supporters he's calling him the dregs of society and yet when Donald Trump calls a handful of hack journalists scum then it's awful then it's an attack on our country it's an attack on our countrymen but Joe Biden former vice president of the United States refers to half the country's the dregs of society that's okay it's applause he's wearing a tuxedo look he's wearing a tux he can't be immature and uncivil he's in a tuxedo we've got a lot more even more Democrats are doing this before we get to it though before we get to celebrate a Constitution day before we get to talking about Hillary before we get to talk about Alexandria occasionally cortex I stole that from Steve Hayward I can't take credit for that Alexandria occasional cortex before we talk about all of that I've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube if you are on Facebook and YouTube go to daily wire come on you're there thank you very much you help keep the lights on you keep khofifah in my cup you keep me sleeping soundly on my purple mattress all snug as a bug with my pair of thieves boxers on you do a lot for me basically is what I'm saying if you haven't subscribed it's ten bucks a month 100 dollars for an annual membership you get me you get the indra clave ensure you get the Ben Shapiro show you get to ask questions in the mailbag that's coming up on Thursday you get to ask questions in the conversation much more importantly you get the leftists here's tumblr and we've been focusing a lot on Washington leftist ears recently and look there are some great vintages of leftist ears that come out of Washington but now we've got that Ann Holloway and Hathaway Hollywood vintage and those are those are tasty those you know I do think that the ground is much more fertile out here in Hollywood the sun is shining more and it just produces more delicious leftist yours so go to daily wire comm we'll be right back so that's the insulting reckless bitter immature language of statesmen former Secretary of State former senators former vice president it's also true in the left wings pundit class even the Washington Post the these left-hand pundits who go on TV here's Jennifer Rubin talking about the president Donald Trump has killed those people twice once through neglect and oversight and secondly disgracing that they died at all and that's what death denial that's what Holocaust denial that's what all these denial syndromes are all about is killing the person twice so Donald Trump is a murderer he's a Nazi yeah he's a Holocaust denier and he's killed people twice because there was a hurricane that's Jennifer Rubin a left-wing analyst with the Washington Post who I think she pretends to be a Republican still but obviously she's a very left-wing partisan and has been for a long time because there was a hurricane because Donald Trump controls the weather I guess he's got even more power than I think he thought he had because he controls the weather he's a Nazi Holocaust denying double murderer and I don't mean double murder like he killed two people I mean double murderer that he killed the same person twice that's what he did according to the left but but Trump's using crazy language is an a he's being so uncivil oh this is bad oh we we Republicans should really take stock of ourselves oh oh no I how could we may occult but man give me a break give me a break when they talk about incivility just laugh just laugh in their face when they talk about Brett Kavanaugh is like a super-secret Nazi rapist murderer just laugh at them just laugh they have no credibility whatsoever it is not worth even acknowledging their stupid hysterical cries they're behaving like little children they should be treated like little children Hillary Clinton today heads this piece in from the Atlantic because she wrote a new chapter for her book what happened I think she's gonna write a new chapter every month it's them I don't know was the Macedonians before now it's the ghanaians and now it's the Nigerians now okay whatever so she wrote this piece in the Atlantic on our constitutional crisis because our democratic institutions our democracy is being on mind it's under attack that's what she's a legend she's alleging this as the woman who is undermining her democracy as the woman who is undermining our democratic election or duly elected president she's saying it's under a tag it's under a tech she's okay it's okay Shh she's my third cousin once removed as you all know it's hush it's okay it's all right you lost if Mitt Romney had done this in 2012 he would be excoriated people aren't excoriating you because they haven't you know wrapped her up in a straitjacket and hauled her out of those woods in Chappaqua yet she's behaving like a crazy person she's not to be taken seriously they are not to be taken seriously now this doesn't mean that we should delve to their level maybe their next judge candidate you know maybe we maybe we give them a little taste of their own medicine but I don't think generally we should delve to their level it does mean though that we should stop flogging ourselves when a Republican uses nasty language when Donald Trump sends out a mean tweet and Republicans there are some Republicans and some conservatives who spend more time shrieking about Donald Trump's tweets than they ever would talking about Joe Biden or John Kerry from Jennifer Rubin or Hillary Clinton because they feel oh I don't want to be seen as one of those people it's okay it's all right politics is ugly Otto von Bismarck I think said that it's much better to eat the sausage without seeing how it's made you know politics is an ugly business it's particularly ugly at this moment it's all right doesn't mean we shouldn't fight back we should fight back because there are actual stakes here there was actual freedom there's actual American Liberty there was actual American Western civilization at stake we should fight hard to protect it a lot of hypocrisy on this front a lot of hypocrisy from the left I do want to speak briefly before we have to go about Alexandria Ocasio Cortez she did this interview in Interview magazine creative creative title and the in the interview she was wearing a $3,500 outfit so she was wearing a blazer that was almost $2,000 she was wearing pants that were almost $1000 she was 600 other shoes okay people are attacking her because she's a socialist self-proclaimed socialist wearing thousands of dollars of clothing now some are saying it's not pher they always go after women women were expensive clothing lay off no it's not fair when they go after Republican women it is fair when they go after socialists not even all Democrats it's not even fair when they go after all Democrats but it is totally fair game when they go after socialists this woman is saying we need to soak the rich take all of their money wealth is bad choice is bad Bernie Sanders her dear pal when he was running in 2016 one of his major talking points is that we have too many choices of deodorant there's no joke that when you go to the drugstore you see too many choices of deodorant we we don't need all that deodorant we only need one or two we need to centralize it and stop people from having all these nice things then she wears $3,000 worth of clothing 3500 dollars worth of clothing that is hypocrisy I'm not out there saying that we all need to be exactly materially equal exactly financially equal she is and she's giving that old George Orwell animal Pharm line we're all equal but some of us are more equal than others that's the Alexandria Ocasio cortes line and that's exactly what's going to happen if her preferred system of government is instituted if socialism is instituted there will be a concentration of wealth and power and privilege among the chrony class and she will be right there it's totally fair it is an issue of hypocrisy this also brings us to Chelsea Clinton I want to get to before we go Chelsea Clinton over the weekend you know she's a big abortion proponent she's been talking about how great roe v wade is how we should have legal abortion and why cuz she's a Democrat she's a political animal I mean she was created in in a environment to politics she's been in politics her whole life then she went a little too far here's what she said about roe v wade it's a deeply religious person it's also unchristian so she's saying she's a she goes on and I'm in the interview but that's all you need to hear she says as a deeply religious person it would be unchristian to outlaw abortion there are plenty of people who are Christian who support abortion in spite of their faith I think almost half of American Catholics support abortion even though their faith clearly says that abortion is gravely immoral and intrinsically evil okay some people do that some people have a complicated view of theology they're on a spiritual journey they haven't gotten there yet that's fine look I went from atheist to Catholic to a you know Christian revert in an over a number of years and it doesn't happen all at once it kind of okay that's fine but to pretend that your support for killing little babies comes from your Christian faith is outrageous that is awful and that is really really a terrible thing she should be called out for it Matt Walsh called her out for it and I think she responded to him you know it is that is a step too far you know it's it's one thing too we see this a lot in the breakdown of the church we see this a lot in the breakdown of American politics it's one thing to say I understand that there is a moral order and I'm violating it and I'm doing it because I'm a weak and broken person but I still acknowledge that there's a moral order that's one thing it's a totally different thing to say there's no moral order good is bad up is down war is peace murder is great that's a total that is much more pernicious even if you're doing the exact same thing to deny the very essence of an order of a political or of a moral order that is much much worse it's much more dangerous that's the territory that the left is moving into when her mother ran for president in 2008 she said abortion should be safe legal and rare now Chelsea Clinton is saying abortion is a great thing and it's very Christian that is a huge shift and this is where heresy creeps in in religion and this is where our constitutional order is seriously undermined and broken down when people undercut the very doctrines the very philosophical premises and institutions that undergo a country this brings us in the last few minutes to Constitution Day on this day in history in 1787 our wonderful Constitution was signed it's a great thing you can see I'm wearing my time my Constitution day time so we don't need to give a lecture on the Constitution because if you're watching or listening to this show you probably know a lot about the Constitution unfortunately most people in America don't know very much about the Constitution there was a poll out from the Annenberg Public Policy Center out of the University of Pennsylvania which shows that of all Americans 37 percent cannot name a single right protected by the First Amendment First Amendment protects multiple rights free speech free assembly no establishment of religion right they can't name what 3/4 of Americans cannot name all three branches of our government the executive the legislature and the judiciary one-third of Americans can't name any branch of our government it's just pretty crazy because all we talk about now is the president it can't even name one of them this is a scary thing because our Constitution is a wonderful document it's a great piece of paper it sets up a terrific government from the greatest nation in them certainly in the modern era probably in the history of the world but if you don't know it if you don't know about your Constitution if you don't know about your government if you don't know about the institutions created and described by the Constitution it's not going to exist very long freedom isn't passed in the bloodstream it's only one generation away from extinction as Ronald Reagan used to say and we're talking now coincidentally on constitution day about a new Supreme Court justice who's going to go to the court and interpret the Constitution hopefully defend the Constitution against other judges who want to undermine the Constitution and now there are these crazy allegations that he's a monster he's a thirty five years ago he groped a girl or something okay the allegations he do are not credible but even if they were we also have to remember that men are not angels and this was what Alexander Hamilton described about our Constitution he said quote if men were angels no government would be necessary if angels were to govern men neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary in framing a government which is to be administered by men over men the great difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige you to control itself men are not angels we're not governed by angels there are bad guys who govern us I think Brett Kavanaugh is probably on the very good end of men who govern us some other people might have a little spottier past you know I'm not calling out our president at the moment but it's got a little more of a checkered personal history than someone like judge Cavanaugh okay the guard wears rails hold the the government was set up because we're not a nation of men where our nation doesn't rise and fall depending on the men who are running in or we're a nation of laws but we need to understand those laws we have to understand our own system of government John Adams said that the Constitution is built for a moral and religious people and it's unfit to govern anybody else we're seeing a huge decline in religiosity among people we're seeing a huge decline in knowledge of our country and when that happens well forget about the people governing us think about the people who are being governed when that happened we don't know our country and we don't know our Constitution when we can't discipline ourselves when we can't govern ourselves no piece of paper is going to protect us no piece of paper is going to help we can have as many tea party rallies as we want we can go either we say this is a great document you should read might I read it it won't matter because the people have to understand their government they have to be educated in it they need to be citizens being a citizen is not a passive activity you know it's not just bread and circuses and being entertained you have to participate in your government if you're gonna govern yourself and if you're unwilling to participate unwilling to educate yourself unwilling to discipline yourself then someone is gonna run your life for you that's the debate that we're having right now I hope that we'll be speaking on next year's Constitution Day and things will be looking even better but who knows it's up to us it's up to us to decide what kind of country we want to have okay that's our show we ran late as usual I'll be back not tomorrow we will not have a show tomorrow we're gonna do a show on Friday so I'll be back I'll see you on Wednesday in the meantime
