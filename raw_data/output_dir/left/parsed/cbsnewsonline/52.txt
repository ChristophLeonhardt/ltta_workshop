TRANSPORTED WENDY TO A LOCAL 
HOSPITAL WHERE SHE WAS 
PRONOUNCED DEAD. 
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM OUR 
INVESTIGATION, AT THIS POINT, 
IS THAT WENDY, KNOWN AS AN AVID 
RUNNER, WAS JOGGING WESTBOUND 
ON P STREET WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT 
THIS INTERSECTION AT 11TH AND 
P. THE SUSPECT WAS AT THE 
INTERSECTION AND STABBED HER. 
WE BELIEVE THERE WAS ONLY ONE 
PERSON INVOLVED IN THE ASSAULT. 
WE DO NOT HAVE ANY INFORMATION 
TO SUGGEST THAT WENDY KNEW OR 
HAD ANY ASSOCIATION WITH THE 
SUSPECT IN THIS CASE. 
WE ALSO DO NOT HAVE INFORMATION 
AT THIS POINT TO SUGGEST THAT IT
WAS A ROBBERY. 
THE MOTIVE IN THIS CASE RIGHT 
NOW IS UNKNOWN. 
YESTERDAY, WE RELEASED 
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWING A 
PERSON OF INTEREST IN THE CASE. 
IT WAS A COMBINATION OF 
INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVED 
FROM OUR THIRD DISTRICT PATROL 
OFFICERS AND TIPS FROM THE 
COMMUNITY HELPED OUR HOMICIDE 
DETECTIVES ESTABLISH THE 
IDENTIFICATION OF THIS PERSON 
OF INTEREST THAT WAS SHOWN IN 
THE VIDEO. 
HOMICIDE DETECTIVES LAST NIGHT 
SEARCHED THE SURROUNDING AREAS 
LOCATED THIS INDIVIDUAL IN A 
PARK AT 14TH AND GERARD STREET 
NORTHWEST. 
HE WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE 
HOMICIDE DIVISION FOR 
QUESTIONING. 
SUFFICIENT PROBABLE CAUSE WAS 
ESTABLISHED AND THIS MORNING WE 
ARRESTED AND CHARGED 23-YEAR-OLD
ANTHONY CRAWFORD OF NORTHWEST 
D.C. WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER 
WHILE ARMED. 
WENDY, AS MOST OF YOU KNOW, WAS 
RECENTLY ENGAGED. SHE WAS AN 
ACCOMPLISHED PROFESSIONAL WHO 
BY ALL ACCOUNTS WAS BELOVED BY 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS. 
I CANNOT BEGIN TO IMAGINE WHAT 
HER FIANCCAND WHAT HER MOTHER, 
WHAT HER BROTHER, WHAT HER 
FRIENDS ARE GOING THROUGH AND I 
WANT TO EXTEND OUR HEARTFELT 
CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY. 
I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE 
COMMUNITY FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE. 
NOT ONLY FOR ATTEMPTING TO 
PROVIDE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE ON 
THE SCENE, BUT ALSO BY BEING 
COOPERATIVE WITH OUR DETECTIVES 
AND RESPONDING TO THE HOMICIDE 
UNIT ON THE NIGHT OF THIS 
OFFENSE AND LASTLY, BY 
PROVIDING TIPS WHICH WERE 
INSTRUMENTAL IN CLOSING THIS 
CASE. 
ALSO, I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE 
EFFORTS OF THE THIRD DISTRICT 
PATROL OFFICE SOULS, AND IN 
PARTICULAR, DETECTIVE ALEXANDER 
VOGEL. 
WE CAN TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU 
MIGHT HAVE. 
>> 
>> HE WAS LIVING IN NORTHWEST 
D.C. AND HAD A HOME IN 
NORTHWEST D.C.. 
HE WAS NOT HOMELESS. 
IT IS NOT OUR UNDERSTANDING 
THAT HE WAS HOMELESS. 
WHO DOES HAVE A CRIMINAL 
HISTORY. 
WE ARE STILL GOING OVER THAT TO 
IDENTIFY THE EXTENT OF THAT 
CRIMINAL HISTORY. 
>>  
>> WE DON'T HAVE A MOTIVE IN 
THIS CASE. 
WE DO NOT. 
>>  
>> THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO, LIKE 
I SAID, AND THE COOPERATION OF 
THE PUBLIC AND PROVIDING TIPS 
WAS REALLY THE KEY TO CLOSING 
THIS CASE. 
HAVING PATROL OFFICERS FAMILIAR 
WITH THE COMMUNITY AND THE 
FOLKS, IT WAS ALSO HELPFUL. 
WHENEVER YOU HAVE THIS 
UNEXPLAINED TYPE OF BRUTAL 
ATTACK THAT  HAPPENED, WE DO 
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET TO THE 
BOTTOM OF THIS AS QUICKLY AS WE 
CAN. 
IT WAS A COMBINAION OF EFFORTS 
BY THE COMMUNITY AND THE POLICE 
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET THIS 
GUY RELATIVELY QUICK. 
>> 
>> THE SUSPECT WAS TAKEN TO THE 
HOSPITAL FOR THE INJURY HE HAS 
ON HIS HAND, YES. 
>>  Ãº>> T 
COOPERATE WITH US. 
>> ANY TYPE OF MENTAL ISSUES? 
>> ALL OF THAT WILL BE LOOKED 
INTO AND AS YOU KNOW, WE WILL 
LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT THE 
SUSPECT'S PAST TO SEE IF THERE 
WAS INDICATION THAT COULD LEAD 
SOMEONE TO THIS TYPE OF 
VIOLENCE. 
WE WILL BE TAKING A LOOK AT NOT 
ONLY HIS CRIMINAL PAST BUT IF 
HE HAD ANY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES 
OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES THAT 
POTENTIALLY WE COULD HAVE TAKEN 
CARE OF. 
>>  
>> THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION 
WILL BECOME AVAILABLE WHEN HE 
IS PRESENTED IN COURT, THAT 
KIND OF DETAIL. 
>> DID THEY EXCHANGE WORDS 
BEFORE OR DURING THE ATTACK? 
>> WE WERE ABLE TO TALK TO 
MULTIPLE WITNESSES AND WE DON'T 
HAVE ANYTHING TO SUGGEST THERE 
WAS ANY TYPE OF CONFRONTATION 
BETWEEN THE TWO. 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS AN 
UNPROVOKED ATTACK. 
>> IS IT MANAGED TO THE VIDEO, 
IS THAT HOW YOU GOT HIM? 
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT THE 
VIDEO. 
ALTHOUGH IT WAS A LITTLE BIT 
GRAINY AND YOU'VE ALL SEEN 
THIS, THERE WAS A VERY DISTINCT 
SHIRT THAT THE SUSPECT WAS 
WEARING. 
YOU CAN SEE HE WAS WEARING 
SWEATPANTS AND HAD WHITE SOCKS 
AND SANDALS ON. 
THAT UNIQUENESS OF THE VIDEO IS 
THE TYPE OF THING PATROL 
OFFICERS, LIKE I SAID, THEY HAD 
A VERY GOOD SENSE AS TO WHO THE 
PERSON OF INTEREST WAS. 
WE HAD FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY 
WHO DID A FANTASTIC JOB OF 
IDENTIFYING THEM AND WE WERE 
ABLE TO MARRY UP THAT 
INFORMATION AND LOCATE THE 
SUSPECT OVER 14TH AND GERARD 
AND WE WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A 
LITTLE BIT MORE PROBABLE CAUSE 
AND WE HAD ENOUGH TO MAKE AN 
ARREST. 
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE 
STABBING, ITSELF? 
WAS IT ALL IN ONE LOCATION? 
DID THE ASSAILANT FOLLOW THE 
VICTIM? 
>> WITHOUT GETTING INTO TOO MUCH
DETAIL, OUR UNDERSTANDING AS IT 
HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY. 
THE VICTIM IN THIS CASE, I HAVE 
A HARD TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS 
PUBLICLY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT 
THERE IS A FAMILY WHO IS 
WATCHING AND THIS IS A 
DIFFICULT THING FOR THEM TO 
HAVE TO RELIVE. 
SHE WAS INJURED VERY SEVERELY 
AND MADE HER WAY INTO THIS 
CARRY OUT BEHIND ME AND 
THANKFULLY THERE WERE FOLKS IN 
THE CARRY OUT WHO WENT ABOVE 
AND BEYOND TO TRY TO HELP HER 
UNTIL POLICE AND FLOWER COULD 
ARRIVE ON THE SCENE. 
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY COULD NOT 
DO ENOUGH TO SAVE HER LIFE. 
 WE ARE STILL COMBING 
THROUGH THE CRIMINAL HISTORY 
AND I WILL LET THE AMBULANCE 
PASS. 
 WE ARE COMBING 
THROUGH HIS PERSONAL HISTORY 
RIGHT NOW BUT WE DO NOT HAVE 
ANY INDICATIONS OF VIOLENCE IN 
HIS CRIMINAL PAST. 
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE IN 
THE REST OF THE CITY WHO ARE 
SHAKEN UP BY THIS? 
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THE MAYOR 
WANTS TO COMMENT. 
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS I LIVE IN 
THIS CITY AND I THINK THAT IT IS
UNSETTLING FOR ANYONE WHO LIVES 
IN THE CITY TO SEE SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS HAPPEN. 
THIS IS A VERY ISOLATED 
INSTANCE. 
YOU DON'T SEE CRIMES LIKE THIS 
VERY MUCH, EVEN DURING THE 
COURSE OF MY CAREER, SO IT'S A 
VERY UNLIKELY THING THAT 
OCCURRED HERE AT THIS 
INTERSECTION. 
AT THE SAME TIME, IT DOESN'T 
BRING ANY LEVEL OF COMFORT TO 
THE MARTINEZ FAMILY. 
>> WHAT TIME WAS THE ARREST 
MADE? 
>> LATE LAST NIGHT AND HE WAS 
INITIALLY BROUGHT IN FOR 
QUESTIONING AND THE ARREST WAS 
MADE AT OUR HOMICIDE BRANCH, 
THE 100 BLOCK OF M STREET 
SOUTHWEST. 
HE NEEDED MEDICAL ATTENTION. 
I DO NOT KNOW, BUT I CAN'T SAY 
FOR SURE. 
>> 
>> THIS IS A GOOD POINT. 
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY SAFE 
NEIGHBORHOOD, AND IT'S A VERY 
UNUSUAL INCIDENT. 
I'M SURE NONE OF US WISH WE 
WERE HERE AT THIS POINT TODAY. 
>> 
>> IN WHAT WAY? 
HE DIDN'T COOPERATE WITH OUR 
INVESTIGATORS. 
I CAN SAY THAT. 
HE DID NOT. 
>> 
>> HE WAS NOT WEARING THAT 
SHIRT. 
>> 
>> THAT KIND OF DETAIL WILL COME
OUT IN THE COURT DOCUMENTS. 
I'M RELUCTANT TO SAY ANYTHING 
THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE 
CASE. 
>> BEFORE THE VIDEOTAPE, DID 
SOMEONE SAY THAT WAS THE GUY? 
SHE WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO 
SAY ANYTHING. 
DID SOMEONE WITNESS IT AND THEN 
TOLD YOU WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING 
FOR? 
>> IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS 
PARTICULAR LOCATION, ON THE 
WARM EVENING, WHICH TUESDAY 
NIGHT WAS AROUND 8:00 P.M., 
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT 
HERE. 
THE WITNESSES WE SPOKE TO HAD 
VARYING VIEWS AND PERSPECTIVES 
ON WHAT HAD OCCURRED. 
WE HAVE TO PIECE THAT TOGETHER. 
I WOULD NOT WANT TO SAY. 
WHAT WE DO KNOW, AND THOSE ARE 
THINGS I TALKED ABOUT ALREADY, 
IS THAT WHEN HE WAS JOGGING 
WESTBOUND ON P STREET AND GOT 
TO THIS INTERSECTION AND THERE 
WAS THE STABBING AND THE 
SUSPECT FLED ON FOOT SOUTH ON 
11TH STREET. 
ESSENTIALLY, THOSE ARE THE 
FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT 
IN THE WITNESS STATEMENTS. 
>> MAYOR AND CHIEF, I THINK WE 
CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THE 
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING VIDEO 
FOOTAGE TO DETER CRIME AND LEAD 
TO QUICK ARRESTS WHEN THERE IS 
A CRIME. 
WE KNOW WE HAD VIDEO FROM THIS 
INTERSECTION. 
WE FREQUENTLY TALKED IN 
NEIGHBORHOODS ABOUT PRIVATE 
SECURITY CAMERAS THAT WE MAY 
TAP IN CASE THERE IS AN 
INCIDENT AND TO THE GENTLEMAN'S 
POINT, WE DO EXPECT SAFETY IN 
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. 
IT'S IN ANY AND ALL 
NEIGHBORHOODS, WHETHER LOGAN 
CIRCLE OR WELLINGTON PARK. 
WE WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE 
GOING ABOUT THEIR NORMAL 
ACTIVITIES. 
A WOMAN JOGGING ON OUR STREET 
IS A NORMAL ACTIVITY AND THAT'S 
WHY I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO 
COMMUNITY MEMBERS. 
IT'S ANOTHER VERY KEY PART OF 
THIS EQUATION. 
PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO SAY WHAT 
THEY KNEW AND TO HELP IN 
ANYWAY. 
THIS IS AN OUTRAGED COMMUNITY. 
THIS IS A WOMAN WHO SHOULD BE 
GOING TO WORK TODAY. 
THAT COOPERATION WITH OUR 
DETECTIVES AND POLICE WILL HELP 
US BRING JUSTICE FOR THIS WOMAN 
AND HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY. 
>> MAYOR, -- 
>> ONE SECOND. 
>> WAS THERE ANYONE WHO KNEW 
WENDY WHO MIGHT WANT TO ADDRESS 
US AND GIVE US INSIGHT? I 
BELIEVE THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE 
WHO KNEW HER? 
>> WE ARE GOING TO WRAP UP THIS 
OFFICIAL BRIEFING AND THEN I'M 
SURE YOU CAN TALK TO FRIENDS 
AND FAMILY. 
YES? 
>> I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE STILL 
SOME IN SHELTER TODAY. 
>> I EXPECT THIS AND I WILL HAVE
CHIEF GREGORY DEAN FROM THE 
FIRE DEPARTMENT WITH US AND HE 
CAN GIVE US THE LATEST ON THE 
WRAP UP OF THE FIRE OPERATIONS. 
THIS WON'T BE -- PEOPLE WON'T 
BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO ARTHUR 
CAMPER ANYTIME SOON. 
WHILE WE WORK ON THE CONDITION 
OF THE BUILDING AND WHAT IT WILL
TAKE, WE WILL HAVE TO WORK VERY 
HARD TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE 
OTHER HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS. 
>> ABOUT 40 PEOPLE ARE STILL AT 
GREENLEAF AND WE ARE WORKING 
CLOSELY WITH THEM. 
WE DO HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING, IT'S 
JUST GETTING EVERYBODY MOVED 
AND WE WILL WORK OUR WAY 
THROUGH THAT. 
>> TODAY AND TOMORROW, WILL YOU 
EVENTUALLY GO INTO A SEARCH AND 
MAKE SURE NOBODY WENT IN THAT 
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT WAS 
GOING IN AS A RESCUER? 
>> TODAY, WE ARE ON THE SCENE 
AND WORKING WITH THE ABILITY 
DEPARTMENT AND WE WILL TAKE A 
DETERMINATION OF THE STABILITY 
OF THE BUILDING AND WHEN WE DO 
THAT, IF THEY SAY IT IS STABLE, 
WE WILL PUT PEOPLE IN THERE. 
WE ARE WORKING WITH THE 
BUILDING OWNER TO GET FENCING 
AROUND THAT PROPERTY AND WE 
WILL HAVE A CRANE COME IN AND 
USE THAT TO CHERRY PICK WHERE 
WE THINK THE FIRE STARTED TO 
LOOK AT THAT SCENE. 
WHEN WE GET THERE, WE WILL 
START WALKING BACK THROUGH AND 
IF IT'S STABLE ENOUGH, WE WILL 
GO THROUGH ALL THE FLOORS WITH 
A SECONDARY SEARCH TO MAKE SURE 
WE DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING. 
>> THE LAST TIME IT WAS 
INSPECTED, DID YOU KNOW 
ANYTHING ABOUT SPRINKLERS AND 
ALARMS? 
>> THE BUILDING WAS INSPECTED 
BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT A YEAR 
AGO AND IT WAS INSPECTED BY THE 
HOUSING DEPARTMENT. 
>>> WE'VE BEEN MONITORING THIS 
PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE 
MAYOR OF WASHINGTON, D.C. AS 
WELL IS THE POLICE CHIEF. 
OFFICIALS SAY THAT THE MAN 
SUSPECTED IN THE KILLING OF 
WENDY MARTINEZ, YOU SEE HER, 
THE WOMAN THAT WAS JOGGING IN 
WASHINGTON, D.C. ON TUESDAY 
EVENING, SHE WAS APPARENTLY, 
ACCORDING TO POLICE, RANDOMLY 
ATTACKED BY THIS YOUNG MAN. 
HIS NAME IS ANTHONY CRAWFORD, 
23 YEARS OLD AND FROM THE AREA. 
POLICE SAID THEY HAD NO PRIOR 
CONTACT, AT LEAST I DON'T 
BELIEVE THEY DID. 
IT DOES APPEAR IT WAS JUST A 
RANDOM ACT OF VIOLENCE. 
THE SUSPECT IS NOW IN CUSTODY 
AND PEOPLE WERE WORRIED OVER 
THE LAST FEW HOURS AND DAYS THAT
THE SUSPECT WAS STILL AT LARGE. 
POLICE ARE SAYING THEY ACTUALLY 
APPREHENDED HIM ON WEDNESDAY 
EVENING. 
WE WILL FOLLOW THIS. 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE IS WRAPPING UP AND 
WE WILL PIVOT TO ANOTHER STORY. 
>>> RECOVERY EFFORTS ARE UNDER 
WAY IN NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE 
FLORENCE. 
THE HURRICANE DUMPED ABOUT 8 
TRILLION GALLONS OF WATER ON 
NORTH CAROLINA, MORE THAN EIGHT 
MONTHS WORTH OF RAIN FOR THE 
AREA. 
THOUSANDS ARE STILL LIVING IN 
SHELTERS AS THE WATER RECEDES. 
FOOD AND WATER ARE BEING 
DISTRIBUTED AS THE LONG 
RECOVERY PROCESS BEGINS. 
LET'S BRING IN THE PRESIDENT 
AND CEO OF THE AMERICAN RED 
CROSS, GAIL MCGOVERN. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. 
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON 
THE SHOW. 
I APPRECIATED. 
>> WHAT IS THE SITUATION ON THE 
GROUND AND WHAT IS THE RED 
CROSS DOING TO HELP? 
>> THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND 
IS REALLY DIRE. 
PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES AND 
BUSINESSES. 
THEY LOST LIVESTOCK, CROPS AND 
THERE WAS LOSS OF LIFE, TOO. 
OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO EVERYONE 
IMPACTED BY THIS STORM. 
THE RIVERS ARE STILL CRESTING 
AND FLOODING. 
YOU MENTIONED THE RAIN. 
IT'S RECORD-SETTING.
