1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
so it's 3am and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've work at nine which</font>

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,270
means i have to leave the house at part

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,019
7 which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna live with you</font>

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,900
guys I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been happy a lot of time</font>

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,450
lately but when I have been happy I have

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,250
been genuinely happy but when I haven't

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">been happy I really haven't been happy</font>

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,400
and I don't really understand it I'm

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,320
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to embrace it and I'm trying to</font>

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,670
kind of like analyze it in some way

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,260
because that's what I do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just got</font>

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">really depressed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as now because I was</font>

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,840
just actually been sitting on the

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,810
internet for<font color="#E5E5E5"> like four hours without any</font>

15
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,850
record of what I've actually been doing

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that how really been doing anything I I</font>

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,120
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what I've been doing</font>

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,550
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really know what pull is the</font>

19
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,540
addiction is because I wasn't one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,680
those kids who's like really ditch<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

21
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,239
screens or like Nintendo I didn't have a

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,250
Nintendo or Xbox about any of this when

23
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,190
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kid so I don't really know if it's</font>

24
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a screen addiction or what it is</font>

25
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,550
but I think what stresses me out about

26
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,840
life as well at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment it's kind of</font>

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,520
correlating is that I don't know I'm

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,770
telling you all this I'm eggnog what

29
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,210
normalizing make me about life that's

30
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,539
kind of depressing me or confusing me or

31
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,430
just kind of weighing down on me as well

32
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,339
is actually my privilege and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font>

33
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,780
that I realize how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many choices I have</font>

34
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,970
and that I graduated University now okay

35
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,740
i'm doing a masters but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

36
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,590
literally I'm I'm like one year away

37
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,290
from a pure absolute adulthood<font color="#E5E5E5"> like my</font>

38
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,700
parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> will turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around and be like</font>

39
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">wise to here they wouldn't really but</font>

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,210
you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not complaining about ocean</font>

41
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,979
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's beautiful but it the</font>

42
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,840
beauty is almost threatening in might

43
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,340
have so many choices have a lot of

44
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,530
qualifications and I went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you</font>

45
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,000
know I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a good school a good you</font>

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,710
know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a high state school but a good</font>

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,680
stool and i went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a uni and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i got a</font>

48
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,430

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,189
Russell Group University masters course

50
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,890
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really cool but at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

51
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,259
time it's like why God<font color="#CCCCCC"> pression I could</font>

52
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,329
live any life right now which is awesome

53
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,159
and I think I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be envious of</font>

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,290
my my earlier self later and be like

55
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,000

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,960
this is it like I'm only gonna be

59
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">closing doors from now on like the time</font>

doctor I'm gonna hatch an egg anything

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,020
could happen and that's kind of gonna

64
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,760
slowly stop from now on that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
also the end

66
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,670
that fascinates and terrifies me it's

67
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,650
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on that laptop and it's a</font>

68
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,349
piece of plastic with some electronic

69
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,200
connector wire spaghetti things inside

70
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,569
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I touch it and I'm connected to the</font>

71
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,459
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> world i was on the toilet just now</font>

72
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:31,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">wondering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and about how bad it is to</font>

73
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:32,840
cross your legs and how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font>

74
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,069
damaging my ankles<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they literally</font>

75
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,629
spend most of the day when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not work</font>

76
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,129
having my legs crossed somewhere talking

77
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,260
to people in coffee shops at home I just

78
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,030
crossed<font color="#CCCCCC"> my legs a lot I was like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I</font>

79
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,709
wonder and I was that oh I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> never know</font>

80
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,389
and then I will know because it electron

81
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:45,620
next door and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will tell me like</font>

82
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,379
literally anything you you you ask like

83
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,060
I have so many questions a day and all

84
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these questions I could look up on</font>

85
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:52,849
google sudden no idea by don't actually

86
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,470
it's almost like the human brain doesn't

87
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,669
actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know these these</font>

88
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:57,230
answers to these questions because

89
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,639
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> there they're right there and</font>

90
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,500
it's ridiculous how so many people now

91
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,419
connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and it's like</font>

92
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,489
it's all this thing of like I could

93
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,769
actually know anything I can know it

94
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,810
know it let's not go pistol article

95
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,709
about this but I could find out things

96
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">that other people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think like that and</font>

97
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:17,389
that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pressure I feel like any</font>

98
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:19,280
time any time I waste time I actually

99
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,099
felt like triple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bad as I wasn't as a</font>

100
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,680
kid because I could have really been

101
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,239
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in my time Joe me like</font>

102
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,829
when you're a kid you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know okay I could</font>

103
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,150
have been learning my three times table

104
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,090
but I played<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Legos 10 hours I made</font>

105
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,280
some plasticine<font color="#CCCCCC"> donut but known actually</font>

106
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,440
really could have done something then I

107
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,479
don't know it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think</font>

108
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">our generation really needs to deal with</font>

109
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,229
and when I say my generation I mean me

110
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,510
is that we are we have so many

111
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,280
opportunities and making responsible

112
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,069
decisions about that and you know while

113
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,419
celebrate in fact we have so many

114
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunities not holding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

115
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,500
childhood too long because we're so used

116
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,269
to having all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those options and to give</font>

117
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,939
up those<font color="#E5E5E5"> options and as a sacrifice in</font>

118
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,750
order to follow an important option is

119
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,010
scary and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need to</font>

120
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,689
probably get over and I probably need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

121
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:09,560
get over and make some decisions it's

122
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,879
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> also depressing because the one</font>

123
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,109
thing that the internet can't change

124
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:14,900
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> really and no amount of university</font>

125
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,000
is going to is the amount jobs are

126
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,220
available to us in the sectors that we

127
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,988
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into and that's something</font>

128
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:22,990
that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Abby picked up on her video</font>

129
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,370
that she put up with her channel this

130
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,490
week<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

131
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,770
and how she feels about the job market

132
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,259
and her<font color="#E5E5E5"> her place in the world right now</font>

133
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,229
and that's something we can't control we

134
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:35,430
need to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that we do</font>

135
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,750
have always options we can do with so

136
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,580
probably to fight about 18 million times

137
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,710
harder for it missing opportunities you

138
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,419
have is that worse than not having

139
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,880
opportunities no it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not but</font>

140
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,199
thanks for listening I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know</font>

141
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,759
what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you for</font>

142
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,720
listening to it anyway oh my hair look

143
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,380
good night good<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning bad morning it's</font>

144
00:04:55,380 --> 00:00:00,000
gonna be a terrible morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> bye</font>
