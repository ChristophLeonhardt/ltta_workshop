it's a popular place for local shoppers and tourists wanting a taste of Italy but at this market in Rome there's one thing that's not so popular and that's the currency they've used for the last 60 years Alberto is a pensioner who gets 600 euros per month he and his friends who meet here every day say ditching the lira has brought nothing but problems it was supposed to be two thousand lira to the euro but what used to cost a thousand lira suddenly became wrong euro so somebody stole half of our money but what about the so-called nuclear option that scared the financial markets lately in other words Italy leaving the eurozone not everyone's prepared to press that button no I don't think we should leave but we should renegotiate so we're not bowing our heads to Germany I'd be okay with trying to leave the euro but of course things could get even worse it's not hard to find Italians he'll tell you the euros been bad for the country and bad for their own finances but many of the same people say that it would be a bad idea for Italy to scrap the currency and that's a nuance that Italy's politicians are well aware of the issue of eurozone membership was largely avoided in the run-up to the general election in March this financial expert says it should not be taboo to talk about quitting the euro if you say clearly I'm going to leave the euro the markets will attack you strongly and we would finish as the Greece at the opposite you have to have a B plan in order to exit from Euro not saying these clearly and some Italians are ready to back any party promising to get rid of the single currency people like Daniella fan Yanni whose father set up a butcher's shop here 50 years ago future leaders year if there was a politician trying to get us back to where we were he'd get my vote certainly the euro is something many Italians love to hate but very few people here think it's going to disappear anytime soon Nadine barber al Jazeera Rome
