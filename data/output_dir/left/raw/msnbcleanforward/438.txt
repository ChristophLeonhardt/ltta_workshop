00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:52,780
HAS THE SENATE CHANGED OR HAVE THE SENATORS CHANGED SINCE THE

58
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:54,081
THE SENATORS CHANGED SINCE THE TIME YOU SERVED?

59
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:56,317
TIME YOU SERVED? >> THE SENATORS HAVE CHANGED FAR

60
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:57,451
>> THE SENATORS HAVE CHANGED FAR MORE THAN THE SENATE HAS

00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:57,785
MORE THAN THE SENATE HAS CHANGED.

62
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:00,755
CHANGED. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY MINOR

63
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:01,355
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY MINOR RULES CHANGES.

64
00:02:01,357 --> 00:02:06,093
RULES CHANGES. A COUPLE OF THINGS LIKE THE

65
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:06,894
A COUPLE OF THINGS LIKE THE SIMPLE MAJORITY FOR THE

66
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,796
SIMPLE MAJORITY FOR THE PROCEDURE AT THE END OF

67
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:11,999
PROCEDURE AT THE END OF FILIBUSTER ON A JUDICIAL

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,333
FILIBUSTER ON A JUDICIAL NOMINEE.

69
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:13,100
NOMINEE. BUT FUNDAMENTALLY THE PEOPLE

70
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:16,204
BUT FUNDAMENTALLY THE PEOPLE HAVE CHANGED, BRIAN, AND IT’S

71
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:16,638
HAVE CHANGED, BRIAN, AND IT’S FOR THE WORSE.

72
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:18,473
FOR THE WORSE. PEOPLE COULD PUT IN PLACE A

73
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:19,874
PEOPLE COULD PUT IN PLACE A LEGITIMATE PROCESS THAT WOULD

74
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:20,908
LEGITIMATE PROCESS THAT WOULD GUARANTEE THAT AMERICA WOULD NOT

75
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:22,877
GUARANTEE THAT AMERICA WOULD NOT BE MORE DIVIDED AT THE END OF

76
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:24,678
BE MORE DIVIDED AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS THAN IT WAS AT THE

77
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,314
THIS PROCESS THAN IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING, WHICH IS ALREADY BAD.

78
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:30,018
BEGINNING, WHICH IS ALREADY BAD. I THINK THIS IS A VERY, VERY

79
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,286
I THINK THIS IS A VERY, VERY DANGEROUS -- IT’S OBVIOUSLY SAD.

80
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,422
DANGEROUS -- IT’S OBVIOUSLY SAD. IT’S UNSETTLING.

81
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:35,923
IT’S UNSETTLING. BUT IT’S ALSO DANGEROUS.

82
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:36,924
BUT IT’S ALSO DANGEROUS. IT’S DANGEROUS FOR THE SENATE.

83
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:38,293
IT’S DANGEROUS FOR THE SENATE. IT’S DANGEROUS FOR THE COUNTRY

84
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:40,595
IT’S DANGEROUS FOR THE COUNTRY TO ACCENTUATE THE DIVISIONS THAT

85
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:40,929
TO ACCENTUATE THE DIVISIONS THAT EXIST.

86
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,330
EXIST. AND TO HAVE A PROCESS WHICH

87
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:45,733
AND TO HAVE A PROCESS WHICH CLEARLY WILL LEAVE PEOPLE

88
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:47,101
CLEARLY WILL LEAVE PEOPLE UNTALKED TO WHO SAY THEY HAVE

89
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:48,803
UNTALKED TO WHO SAY THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD TO THIS.

90
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:51,339
SOMETHING TO ADD TO THIS. TO HAVE KEPT MERRICK GARLAND FOR

91
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,709
TO HAVE KEPT MERRICK GARLAND FOR 14 MONTHS FROM NOT ONLY HAVING A

92
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,144
14 MONTHS FROM NOT ONLY HAVING A HEARING BUT NOT EVEN HAVING A

93
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:57,812
HEARING BUT NOT EVEN HAVING A MEETING AND NOW THEY HAVE TO

94
00:02:57,847 --> 00:02:59,114
MEETING AND NOW THEY HAVE TO RUSH TO DO THIS VOTE, IT IS

95
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:00,615
RUSH TO DO THIS VOTE, IT IS GOING TO LEAVE A SCAR.

96
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:01,649
GOING TO LEAVE A SCAR. IT’S GOING TO LEAVE AN OPEN

97
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:03,417
IT’S GOING TO LEAVE AN OPEN WOUND THAT’S GOING TO TAKE A

98
00:03:03,452 --> 00:03:04,252
WOUND THAT’S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO HEAL.

99
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:06,554
LONG TIME TO HEAL. AND I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR THOSE

100
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:08,556
AND I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR THOSE THREE SENATORS SAY OH, THE

101
00:03:08,557 --> 00:03:09,390
THREE SENATORS SAY OH, THE PRESIDENT SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE

102
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:10,659
PRESIDENT SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE THAT OR I’M DISTURBED BY HIM

103
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:12,694
THAT OR I’M DISTURBED BY HIM SAYING IT, THAT DOESN’T DO IT.

104
00:03:12,728 --> 00:03:14,329
SAYING IT, THAT DOESN’T DO IT. YOU CAN’T JUST SAY YOU’RE

105
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,964
YOU CAN’T JUST SAY YOU’RE DISTURBED, YOU DON’T LIKE IT.

106
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:17,732
DISTURBED, YOU DON’T LIKE IT. THERE’S A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE HERE

107
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,068
THERE’S A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE HERE OF WHETHER OR NOT A WOMAN WHO

108
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,336
OF WHETHER OR NOT A WOMAN WHO CAME FORWARD WHO EVERYBODY

109
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:24,272
CAME FORWARD WHO EVERYBODY DEEMED CREDIBLE INCLUDING

110
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:25,907
DEEMED CREDIBLE INCLUDING PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SIMPLY GOING

111
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:28,844
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SIMPLY GOING TO BE CAST ASIDE IN ORDER TO

112
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:31,379
TO BE CAST ASIDE IN ORDER TO BUM-RUSH A NOMINATION TO CHANGE

113
00:03:31,381 --> 00:03:31,946
BUM-RUSH A NOMINATION TO CHANGE THE COURT.

114
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:34,282
THE COURT. AND THAT WILL HAVE A PROFOUND,

115
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:38,319
AND THAT WILL HAVE A PROFOUND, LONG-TERM LASTING IMPACT ON THE

116
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:39,554
LONG-TERM LASTING IMPACT ON THE PROCEDURES, ON THE ATTITUDES, ON

117
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:41,490
PROCEDURES, ON THE ATTITUDES, ON THE APPROACH OF PEOPLE TO THEIR

118
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:45,361
THE APPROACH OF PEOPLE TO THEIR DUTIES AND TO FUTURE CHOICES.

119
00:03:45,395 --> 00:00:00,000
DUTIES AND TO FUTURE CHOICES. I THINK TO CREATE THAT KIND OF
