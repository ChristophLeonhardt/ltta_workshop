00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,550
I'm Bailey serious i'm a graphic

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,299
designer and I focus on print design I

3
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:17,250
was wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an artist but I wanted</font>

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make money I fell in love with screen</font>

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,390
printing and letterpress and just the

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,190
tactile nature of stationery I

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,280
always start with inspiration there's

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,850
color palettes or images or similar

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,500
things that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of recreate</font>

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,750
and put your spin on it which is kind of

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,750
the most fun part of it I think if

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,040
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something right you</font>

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,920
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it lb stop four times if</font>

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,750
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a logo what people</font>

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,750
don't see is the 100-plus sketches of

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,770
the same thing or this the same design

17
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,989
it's going to be you need to start with

18
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:55,460
a bunch of ideas and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> whittle it</font>

19
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,430
down usually your first ideas but

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,839
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> our first idea is the best</font>

21
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:01,760
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just need to get everything now</font>

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,630
and kind of word vomit or brain them and

23
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,420
I guess the deadline wicked meeting of

24
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,880
project as a good good motivation<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,850
to get it done but if it's a truly like

26
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,830
artistic like just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal project</font>

27
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,030
and I feel stuck I will stop and not

28
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,979
look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while go take a walk</font>

29
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:23,870
send an email or send a text message

30
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,260
with a photo of like a process that I'm

31
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through and be like what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

32
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,070
think of this I don't I'm stuck thinking

33
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,250
this I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think having a</font>

34
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,890
network of people that you can trust to

35
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,440
look at your stuff do critique you and

36
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,250
like having<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends that will</font>

37
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,020
be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and give you a thorough</font>

38
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,180
critique your work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will usually</font>

39
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,000
help you I feel like I wouldn't be where

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,550
I am today without my friends and my

41
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,190
colleagues that have pushed me in that

42
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,330
direction<font color="#CCCCCC"> because once you really push</font>

43
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the limits of your creativity that's</font>

44
00:02:00,850 --> 00:00:00,000
when we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the best results</font>
