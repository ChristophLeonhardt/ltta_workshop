IN ALL OF THE CHAOS REGARDING
DENOMINATION OF JUDGE BRETT
KAVANAUGH, WE SHOULD REMEMBER
ONE FACT, IF HE WAS PRO-CHOICE
HE WOULD'VE BEEN CONFIRMED
WITH 100 VOTE.
HE'S NOT AN ADVOCATE FOR
ABORTION BUT DEMOCRATS DIDN'T
HAVE THE VOTES TO STOP HIM.
SO INSTEAD THEY DECIDED TO
SLANDER HIM AS A GANG RAPIST.
DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION STARTED
NOT WITH HIS TEAM FORD BUT
WITH WOMEN IN HANDMADE TALE
OUTFIT OCCUPYING THE HEARING
ROOM.
AND PRO- ABORTION PROTESTERS
BEING DRAGGED OUT OF THE
HEARING
HARING
HEAING
HEARIG
HEARING.
IT'S NOT A SHOCK THAT PLANNED
PARENTHOOD, THE ORGANIZATION
RESPONSIBLE FOR HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS ABORTIONS.
YEAR OPENLY THREATENED
SENATORS IN POETRY SAYING
ROSES ARE RED, VIOLETS ARE
BLUE, SENATORS VOTE NO ON
KAVANAUGH OR WE ARE COMING FOR
YOU.
NOW THAT'S ROMANCE.
ABORTION THE VAST MAJORITY OF
THE LEFT IS NOT MERELY UP
CLINICAL ISSUE BUT IT'S A
DEFINING CHARACTER ISSUE.
IF YOU'RE PRO- ABORTION YOU
ARE A GOOD, GENEROUS, DECENT
PERSON WHO VALUES WOMEN.
IF YOU'RE PRO-LIFE YOU ARE AN
EVIL, REPRESSIVE NATURAL
PERSON WHO WANTS TO CONTROL
WOMEN'S BODY.
IT'S THAT VIEW THAT LEADS TO
THESE IN WHICH A PRO-LIFE
ADVOCATE WAS KICKED IN THE
FACE BY A PRO- ABORTION
NUTCASE.
>> IT'S A BABY.
IF SOMEONE WAS RAPED AND SHE
GAVE BIRTH AND SHE DECIDED TO
KILL HER 3-YEAR-OLD CHILD.
>> THE PRO- ABORTION MOVEMENT
SUGGESTS PRO-LIFERS ARE
EXTREME.
IN REALITY THE EXTREME
POSITION IS HELD BY THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
THEIR PLATFORM CALLS FOR LEGAL
ABORTION ALL THE WAY UNTIL
POINT OF BIRTH BUT PROBE
ABORTION EXTREMISTS GET AWAY
WITH THE RHETORIC BECAUSE THEY
USE EUPHEMISTIC LANGUAGE TO
DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS.
THE WORD ABORTION IS A YOU CAN
EUPHEMISM.
IT'S A POLYP REMOVAL ACCORDING
TO THEM.
THEY IGNORE ADVOCATES TO AVOID
LOOKING REALITY IN THE FACE.
FROM JUST A FEW MOMENTS, LET'S
LOOK REALITY IN THE FACE.
THIS IS A PICTURE OF A 19 WEEK
OLD BABY.
THIS IS A HUMAN CHILD.
THIS IS NOT A BALL OF GOO OR A
CLUSTER OF CELLS.
IN JANUARY, 44 DEMOCRATS IN
THE UNITED STATES SENATE VOTED
NOT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF
BABIES OLDER THAN THIS UNBORN
CHILD.
ONLY THREE DEMOCRATS JOE
MANSION AND BOB CASEY VOTED TO
PROTECT CHILDREN AT 20 WEEKS.
ONLY TWO REPUBLICANS VOTED
AGAINST SUCH PROTECTION.
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THAT
BABY.
THAT IS A HUMAN BEING WITH
ZERO RIGHTS ACCORDING TO THE
MAINSTREAM OF THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
HUMAN LIFE DOESN'T BEGIN AT 20
WEEKS.
THIS IS A PICTURE OF A BABY AT
12 WEEKS, BARELY THREE
MONTHS.
YOU CAN SEE THIS BABY WITH HIS
HANDS NEAR HIS CHEST.
THIS IS NOT A CLUSTER OF
CELLS, THIS IS NOT A BALL OF
GOO.
HIS GENITALIA HAVE BEEN
FORMED, HIS LIVER ENDS CLEAN
PRODUCE RED BLOOD CELLS, THIS
IS AN UNBORN HUMAN BEING.
NOT A SINGLE FEDERALLY ELECTED
DEMOCRAT WOULD VOTE FOR AN
ABORTION BAN THAT WOULD
PROTECT THIS BABY'S LIFE.
LIFE DOESN'T BEGIN AT 14
WEEKS.
THIS IS A PICTURE OF AN UNBORN
HUMAN BEING AT EIGHT WEEKS.
YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE HEAD OF
THIS UNBORN HUMAN, YOU CAN SEE
WHERE THE SMALL BUDS ARE
FORMING FOR ARMS AND LEGS, BUT
GUESS WHAT, LIFE DOESN'T BEGIN
AT EIGHT WEEKS EITHER.
IT BEGINS AT FERTILIZATION
WHEN A NEW HUMAN LIFE IS
BORN.
A NEW HUMAN BEING WITH ITS OWN
DNA, A HUMAN BEING IS NOT ITS
MOTHER OR FATHER, IT'S NOT A
POLYP, IF WE FOUND A HUMAN
EMBRYO ON ANOTHER PLANET THE
HEADLINES WOULD SCREAM HUMAN
LIFE FOUND ON MARS.
THE CONTINUOUS PROCESSING
GROWTH
GOWTH
GROTH
GROWTH.
ABORTION IS THE KILLING OF
THIS HUMAN LIFE.
LATER THE ABORTION TAKES
PLACE, THE MORE BRUTAL THE
PROCEDURE.
NO MATTER THE BRUTALITY, IT IS
OBVIOUS THAT ABORTION IS NOT
SOME MERE OPTIONAL SURGERY TO
BE FOR PERFORMED FOR
CONVENIENCE AND IT'S EVEN MORE
OBVIOUS THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO
PROTECT THE LIVES OF THE
UNBORN AREN'T TRYING TO
CONTROL WOMEN'S BODIES.
THOSE WHO CHERISH ABORTION ARE
TRYING TO CONTROL AND
DISMEMBER THE BODIES OF THE
UNBORN.
THINK ABOUT THAT NEXT TIME YOU
SEE A RADICAL FEMINIST IN A
HANDMADE TALE OUTFIT
