1
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,500
My understanding of America is
a land and a country where,

2
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,259
maybe above
anything else,

3
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,910
there is an understanding
and a recognition

4
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,060
of what each and every one of its
members, of its citizens,

5
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,220
can bring to the building
of a greater country.

6
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,569
Candidates please, 
and I know we practiced this,

7
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:56,530
please raise your right 
hand and repeat after me:

8
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:02,910
I hereby declare

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,560
on oath that I absolutely 
and entirely,

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,710
renounce and abjure

11
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:19,840
all allegiance and fidelity
to any foreign prince,

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,640
potentate, state or
sovereignty,

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,790
of whom or which

14
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,820
I have here to for been

15
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,930
a subject or citizen.

16
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,690
That I will support and defend

17
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,320
the Constitution and laws

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,330
of United States of America.

19
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,880
And that I take this 
obligation freely

20
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,450
without any mental reservation,

21
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,620
or purpose of evasion,

22
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,220
so help me God.

23
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,769
It's a huge moment for me,

24
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:15,910
being a citizen and citizenship
to me is just fully embracing

25
00:02:15,910 --> 00:00:00,000
and fully contributing to this,
to this country that I will now call mine.
