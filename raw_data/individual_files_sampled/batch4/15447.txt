you are in Chicago which is the home of the alt left going back more than a century the radical left has deep roots in Chicago deep roots on campuses but that Chicago style activism that campus style crazy is fully deployed in the capital buildings I think for the first time ever well the president was actually commenting after Senator Charles Grassley who's the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee had made a statement in response to a question on a television news program he was asked whether he thinks some of the protesters are paid and he said he was partial to that view because he had seen many other people who said so and in fact he's correct the original elevator screamer as Trump Lee later called her was a woman who had not complained previously about a sexual assault but that day after the hearing announced that she had been a victim and cornered Jeff Flake in an elevator holding the door open so he couldn't leave she happens to be the leader of a George Soros funded organization in New York so in that sense it was true there are other organizations funded by Soros and other Democratic donors who work with him that were all over Capitol Hill today and throughout the week so strictly speaking it's true now whether it had the effect intended is another story we actually think that it may have pushed Susan Collins and Jeff Flake more firmly onto the side of voting for Brett Kavanaugh Lisa Murkowski the Republican from Alaska broke with her party but the antics of the left-wing protesters seem to have convinced Susan Collins and Jeff Flake and others perhaps that they could not allow the mob to rule the country and so those protests had a very negative effect with or without the president's tweet on the goal of stopping Brett Kavanaugh on the left really lost its marbles and I think there were consequences you know it's very interesting I think this whole thing has been a massacre yeah I I think was it the senator Lyndsay I just forgot his last name I'm sorry Lindsey Graham who who said maybe we ought to throw him in water and if he drowns he's innocent and if he floats he's a witch like he made like it's been so absurd the process in the Senate but that was bad enough that was brutal and dishonest enough but this pussy hat style women's March style Occupy Wall Street crazy is such a mob scene that I think that I think it's scared Main Street America what do you think of agile well it still is I mean just moments ago after her Colin's finished her speech first of all while she was speaking her office was occupied by left-wing protesters and before she started speaking in the Senate gallery they were shouting at her which is illegal you can't not voice opinions or against anything or anyone from the Senate gallery but right after she finished Senator Joe Manchin a Democrat a broke with his party to vote to move the process along and announced that he would vote for Cavanaugh he was trying to give interviews to reporters in the hallway and his voice was drowned out by people chanting shame shame over and over again that was broadcast on live television people are watching this at home the suck hide themselves with the idea that these professional activists are basically able to come and deer the country and have a louder voice than everybody else because they're willing to break the law they're willing to occupy Senate offices they're willing to threaten some of the tweets that came out after Collins's speech said that they're gonna follow her everywhere she goes for the rest of her life I mean this sort of behavior is is out there and it's scaring voters and that's one of the reasons you're seeing Republican enthusiasm now surging in the polls before Democrats were motivated to vote mostly because out of dislike of Trump and Republicans were somewhat complacent or undecided the most recent polls are showing that the Republican voters are suddenly as excited to vote as Democrats because they're alarmed at the behavior they've seen during the Brett Kavanaugh debate so that's the effect of what they're doing but they can't help them the mob runs the Democratic Party they just keep doing that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra Levant show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel da media / shows you
