1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
take a look around me I'm walking in
downtown Houston and you can see that I

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,880
am surrounded by water I want to start
on this street over here because you can

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,570
see there's a submerged vehicle we
talked to police about this Fred they

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,460
said they've rescued the individual who
was in that truck and as we pan over

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,980
take a look at the Harris County
Courthouse probably within the hour

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,349
there were about five to ten people
rescued from inside that building one of

7
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,280
those gentlemen that I talked to said
that the water started rising very

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,730
quickly they began to be evacuated one
of them had a sick toe so he wrapped his

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,039
foot in a plastic bag and first
responders literally carried him above

10
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,449
these waters to make sure that he could
be lifted to safety take a look over

11
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:57,840
here you see more submerged vehicles as
we see these rising waters continue to

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,960
grow a manhole over there that looks
like it's still erupting with water and

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,189
you see first responders beyond there
moments ago we saw and I believe we have

14
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,840
this video a high water vehicle it's
just surreal to see high water vehicles

15
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,670
in downtown Houston of course these are
out here these are resources that were

16
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,409
sent to Houston to make sure that they
rescue people wherever that is needed

17
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,520
and you know many people thought that it
wasn't going to get to this that it

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:00:00,000
wasn't going to be this flooded in
downtown Houston but indeed it is
