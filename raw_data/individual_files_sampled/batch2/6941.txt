a black woman who called the authorities in Seattle to report a burglary was unfortunately victimized by the cops after she was shot by the two responding Seattle Police Officers now are the cops alleged that the woman was holding a knife at the time that they arrived at the scene and she did have a history of mental illness and a history with the police let's give you the full story both Seattle Police Department officers opened fire on charlie no miles inside the apartment building after they said she confronted them brandishing a knife she died at the scene there were actually several children inside the apartment during Sunday's incident though they were uninjured they did witness their mother getting shot and killed though the incident comes four days after Lyles was released from King County Jail following her arrest on June 5th for threatening police officers with large kitchen scissors inside her small and cluttered apartment so family says that she uh had a mental illness that unfortunately was getting worse and um when she had the previous episode with the cops uh she was alleging or yelling at them and saying that they were the KKK and they were out to get her so clearly this woman uh was not mentally sound and and needed help and needed to be treated differently from other people but nonetheless she was the one who called the cops to report a suspected burglary and unfortunately she was the one that was killed as a result of that the Seattle Police Department has been implementing court-ordered reforms since 2012 to address what the US Justice Department investigation found to be a pattern of excessive force by officers and often arose during encounters with the mentally ill or drug addled suspects also keep in mind that that same Justice Department investigation found that the Police Department in Seattle had a racial bias that played a role in the way that they carried out their policing uh this is another tough very tough story uh specifically in this day and age where of course when it comes to another black American citizen dying at the hands of police you immediately react or you don't react but you start to think about all the scenarios that you've played out I mean we falando Castillo the the murder of Luca still be ruled as just an old normalized police encounter last week and in move Follette own scratch everything else it continuously plays a role in how you perceive these events now this event is a little bit different of course because this woman in the situation had a weapon and there was a history of her being not mentally stable as you mentioned the officers in responding to this were aware of that situation because they were told of the address they know that this woman was mentally unstable and have had and some instances in the past with her so therefore you would think that they would be understanding on how to approach this but again it takes me back to my bias coming from a country where we don't have guns so there's plenty of other ways you can deal with the situation right a lot of a criminal activity in the United Kingdom where I'm from is a lot of people having knives in their officers have to try to find a situation in order to deescalate it there was a brilliant video that was out last year where it showed officers from the United States was sitting in with Scottish police officers as they were watching a scenario where a man was running with a knife and I think it was like 10 seconds before they also said yeah he'd be dead here a shot because it's the go to it's the way that it's often you see something that is gonna cause a problem the only way to deal with it is with a gun uh so let me let me jump in really quickly um because I just want to make a point about something that I think needs to be clarified before we move forward first of all I don't think anyone on this panel is saying I don't think you're saying that Oh she'sshe's just holding a knife it's no big deal also I don't know if someone's brandishing a knife obviously there is a threat there there's no question about it however to meet that threat with a lethal weapon I think is disproportionate right I think that that is uh what a level of force that's unnecessary I don't know what happened to the times when cops use non-lethal weapons in order to subdue individuals especially individuals that pose a threat like this situation and to be completely fair this story is also a you know a breaking news story we don't know all the details so we don't know exactly how she was acting but far too often we come across stories where either someone is completely unarmed then they're met with deadly force or in this case they're armed with something like a knife and they could be met with let's say a Taser if they genuinely pose a threat oh I mean you're talking about a thin woman and two male police officers that I'm sure could have handled it differently right uh you know it's interesting we call on cops to do a lot in this society you know they're they're not just called like Batman and Superman art.when moments have reached sort of a critical time in this case they're called we know this person is mentally unstable when they get there as Anna says she has a knife a knife is a legitimate weapon that threatens those peace officers on some level but also that Anna's point and this gets back to what I was saying about we call on the cops to do a lot they have to find a different way to de-escalate the situation and as Francis said they actually go through exercises that are associated with de-escalating these situations it's lots of training it does go back to training but we'll say this you cops out there we know you have a tough gig I mean it's very very hard but having said that some situations it would seem might be easier to decode than others and at least looking at the specifics of this situation with the knife as Anna said there have to be less lethal means of getting toward a resolution and energy but you know when I say training it's not just about oh you know find a way to deescalate a situation with the average person that you run into who might pose a threat there also needs to be an emphasis on training uh regarding those who have mental disabilities right because that is not something that's emphasized a lot of cops are met with situations where someone might have let's say paranoid schizophrenia right and so someone might be acting in a certain way that might be deemed a threat but they're not you know completely cognizant of what's going on and and there has to be proper training in order for them to deal with that situation and again yes the Hadas mentioned over and over again should be mentioned over and over again they do have hard jobs they do put their lives on the line and they do put their lives at risk but at the same time situations like this in my opinion can be de-escalated and you can actually you know avoid murdering someone in order to carry out your job in a logical rational way the reason why I brought up the stuff beforehand is not that I was trying to downplay that there was danger of course this danger what I'm trying to do is that this situation should be an example where you can look to in the past to see okay how are we going to try to de-escalate this situation so others can look to it and take reference from it so that when a falando Castile is reaching for his papers in his car you don't feel like your life is threatened because maybe you can take refuge in the fact that someone else had dealt with the situation where someone had a weapon like a knife and you were able to try and overcome the situation without killing another person that is what I'm trying to stress is like you're not going to learn by just simply looking at the best-case scenarios of being ok they didn't have a weapon we were able to do it without a gun and then as soon as there's any sort of weapons the only way to deal with it is death right you can work on those two ends of the spectrum you have to be able to look at it and see ok so someone does have a weapon what is the stages I can go to and I'm talking about this sit behind a desk I'm not a fool to think that it's it's not hard when you're out there on the streets and you're running into people that yes with this very high intense climate we have right now with policing and in black citizens in the country that there's got to be tensions this is going to be fear but the reason police officers do this job is because they're supposed to go through the training and they're supposed to be able to handle it better than an everyday citizen that's why they go through this training that's why when a situation like a Terrence cruncher when he's walking away you shouldn't feel any inclination to fire your weapon as the first response or if someone's walking away or the next response is not Walker running away literally running away does not pose an imminent threat but he still gets shot in the back several times so I don't I don't know how many of these stories need to occur for people to actually understand there isn't an anti cop agenda okay cops are necessary cops are an important part of society but you know what what else is important maintaining people's lives saving people's lives that's all hope point of being a cop to protect and serve and you know I think the vast majority of cops are good people and I think they do their jobs responsibly but far too often we come across cases like this where someone's life didn't need to end there could have been an a different response or a different reaction to it and unfortunately it ended with a woman with a mental illness being shot and killed and the last thing just to throw it in at the end after this stuff happens it seems in the aftermath as though the investigations really leave you cold I mean it's just there's not enough of a consequence to so many of these horrible stories that Ana mentions we do have today on this show and that we read about and hear about I mean it's become business as usual in America that the investigation just binds that the officers aren't really culpable in any sort of way that sticks it's it's really an outlier though when you find a situation where the weather there has to be a price paid for the kind of default to violence that we see in these stores what you're going to see you this the last point and this is the that's very true because what they're going to do is will draw an underline on the list and say okay she had a weapon done that's there's no reason to and that's where it starts to become cloudy so that when you have again what we stated these cases that continuously get dismissed is because the so the the in a way they're trying to contemplate how they can make an excuse for officers because they're trying to find weapons or trying to find drugs or trying to find these things so that you can make like useful and ideal right and punishing those that go to that extreme means before going through any other stages in between what's in TYT membership
