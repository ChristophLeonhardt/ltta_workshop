one of the reasons Donald Trump has become so popular with many Americans lies in his gut level pro-american ISM Trump doesn't make blue-collar Americans feel bad about themselves he tells them they're not racist they're not sexist Trump doesn't make those who earn feel rotten he tells them he's earned - and he's proud of it most of all though Trump does not tear down law enforcement that last fact was on full display on Tuesday when the president selects called the family of San Antonio police officer Benjamin Marconi who was murdered on Sunday during a traffic stop Police Chief William McMahon has said the uniform was the target in the murder Marconi Sunday and got on Facebook and posted quote just got off the phone with future President Trump he sends his condolences to our family Trump's team has said nothing about the call thus far this isn't the first such call for Trump post-election shortly after the election Trump called the widow of murdered New York Police Department sergeant Paul - as Ollo to offer condolences he said I'm very sorry I cannot be here with you today my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family during this difficult time this is classy stuff it's also necessary President Obama's sometimes called the families of slain cops he routinely called the families of black people shot by cops under disputed circumstances at best when he spoke at the funeral service for targeted and murdered at Dallas police officers he used the dais to rip police across the country as suffering from implicit bias and racism Americans rightly got the impression Obama didn't care nearly as much about targeted officers as he did about his misguided crusade to slander officers as the source of the anti black racism that is certainly not the message from Trump Trump isn't standing by bad police officers of course but he is making it clear that he stands by police officers across the country and that he takes their life seriously that is a hell of a change from the current occupants of the Oval Office I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show all righty so much to get to here today but we begin by saying hello to our sponsors at helix sleep so helix sleep is a great company and the way that this works is you go to their website helix sleep comm slash Penny's the slash spending at $50 off your first order helix sleep comm and the way that they do this is they ask you questions about your body type about your weight that your height they asked questions about whether you like a soft mattress or a hard mattress do you like it to be warm or do you like it - be breathable and then they send you the mattress in the mail they send it to you in the mail and you can try it out for a hundred nights for free and and if you don't like it you can just send it right back a customized mattress can cost you thousands and thousands of dollars but he looks mattress caught they cost you like a fraction of that and then you many cases under a thousand dollars shipping is 100% free it comes in a box and the way that it works is you unpack the box and it automatically inflates it's really cool and it is super comfortable it is so comfortable that we actually just got rid of a mattress that we had very expensive mattress that we had we actually put it in the other room we've got a new bed frame because we liked our helix mattress so much we actually just had that bed frame delivered yesterday that's how much we like the helix mattress its helix sleep comm / Ben helix sleep comm / men and you get $50 off your first order again it's truly customized and you can even customize it if there are two people on the mattress you can customize it so that each side is different which is great and if you're Bill Clinton you can make sure that one side is filled with spikes so that Hillary never sleeps in the same bed I guess but in any case helix sleep calm / man that's the place to go to get this mattress and it is terrific alrighty so lots to get to today we begin with the democrats so you know the fact is that everybody's paying attention to the Trump transition and we'll get to that in a little while there's been some more good Trump bad Trump with regard to the the pics that he's making for his cabinet dr. ben Carson has been picked which is Error but then also he just picked a woman in Betsy DeVos for the for the head of set for the Secretary of Education which is a great pick he's been stomping all over the grave of Kelly Ayotte which is also kind of work but he's made apparently nikki Haley the UN ambassador which is a great pick so we'll talk about all of those and what they mean and why this is happening but first we need to talk about the Democrats because the Democrats are totally falling apart they are utterly falling apart Elijah Cummings is a Democrat I leave that Elijah Cummings is from from Alabama sorry Marilyn my bad so Elijah Cummings is from Maryland and and he is basically the Democrats are struggling for identity they're struggling for identity and that means that they have to fall back on the tried-and-true strategies those strategies include of course saying that black people are gonna be victimized by white Republicans and saying the gay people will be victimized by Trump they have to play identity politics there's been a lot of talk in the aftermath of Trump winning about Democrats dumping identity politics at the door stop alienating white folks by claiming they're all racist stop alienating men by claiming they're all sexist stop alienating rich people by saying that they're all greedy you actually start pitching your policies Elijah Cummings however he says no we can't do that there's no way I think that we I think we need to know I don't necessarily agree I think we need to deal with economics I think economics is very important but I think that we need to still pay attention to so many people who have been left out of the system in one way or another just like what I just talked about voting rights of certain segments of our population I think we can do do both but we've got to concentrate one economics because a lot of people are suffering and african-americans and Hispanics are suffering probably more than other parts of our communities and so that would be my answer there okay so he says that we need to double down on the identity politics of course he thinks they need to double down on the identity politics the Democrats have created this new Obama coalition that is largely based on pressing forward identity politics and that of course is driven a sort of quasi identity politics from the right that is not my favorite thing but Cummings is wrong obviously the way the Democrats have they actually wanted to win could win is by abandoning those identity politics or maybe they're so far down that road there's no way to do it maybe they're afraid that if they had bands and identity politics maybe more black people will vote Republican because they won't feel pressured to vote Democrat because those Republicans are evil racists so they keep doubling down on this one of the ways they're doubling down on this is the push for keith Ellison Muslim Congress person from Minnesota the reason s a Muslim Congress person is because they're only two Muslims in the United States Congress I believe the other one is Andre Carson and and Ellison of course was the first I think Muslim Congress person in in the Congress and so he's gotten major play politically over that he's being talked about very seriously for head of the Democratic National Committee there's a problem there and that is the is that keith Ellison is a radical radical anti-semite I mean is he's radically anti-israel he's associated with the Nation of Islam and the Democrats don't know what to do they're endorsing Ellison because they're doubling down on the identity politics so here's Elizabeth Warren the senator from Massachusetts and the supposed god queen of the love the hardcore left talking about what keith Ellison would be a terrific choice I talked with congressman Ellison I really really like Keith and I think he's terrific and I think he would make a terrific DNC chair I just recently heard that Howard Dean I mean literally just a few minutes ago heard that Howard Dean maybe says I'm n talk to him fine I'd like to hear what his vision is but I want lots of Democrats in engaged and ready to go and she is so irritating and she's also wrong on this I know professor she was professor warm when I was at Harvard Law School she was irritating men she's become twice as irritating now with her faux sincerity that's just a little bit of background about keith ellison so the person she just praises a terrific choice for the DNC this is tape with keith ellison in 2007 when he was asked about 9/11 here's here's this is sir bootlegs tape you never have all this discrimination against religious minorities but for 9/11 and again you had it but you didn't have it to the degree that we have it now all 9/11 is this is this jeffra not event in American history and it allows and it's almost like you know the right stock fire kind of reminds me of that did I know what I'm talking about at 11 who benefited from at 11 who benefited from at 11 well I mean you know you and I don't know yeah boy but but the thing is is that you know after the Reichstag was burned they blamed the Communists for it and it put the leader of that country in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever you wife okay so he compared 9/11 if you missed it to the Reichstag fire which was a faked fire by the Nazis in order to allowed Hitler to consolidate his power so he's actually I mean this is this is a far left radical Islamist lie that has been pushed by by people from from those contingents and there's keith ellison by the way you hear the guy in the audience saying the jews benefited from 9/11 and ellison basically going yeah maybe i mean this is the guy they're talking about for a head of the DNC but that's not the only thing that we know about Keith Ellison Joel Mowbray my friend who writes over at the Daily Caller he wrote the man poised to head the Democratic Party was a spokesman for the Nation of Islam well into his 30s the Nation of Islam is a radically anti-semitic group led by Lewis Farrakhan he publicly spewed anti-semitism and later in life as a congressional candidate knowingly accepted $50,000 in campaign contributions given and raised by Islamic radicals who openly supported Islamic terrorism and were leaders of front group for Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood by the way the periods are in which Ellison defended the Nation of Islam the spokespeople were openly jew-hating in 1995 that guy is on tape keith Ellison he led a rally featuring a guy named Khalid Abdullah Mohammed who was a Nation of Islam member Mohammed got up and said quote if words were swords the chests of Jews gays and whites would be pierced Ellison also defended Louis Farrakhan as quote not a racist not an anti-semite Farrakhan has called Jews Devils okay and in in that's not where it stops by the way here is tape of representative Ellison saying that he voted against funding for irons on this in the middle of a war in which Israel is being hit by rockets he voted against funding Israel's capacity to defend itself point for John Kerry nose run around trying to achieve one I think it's exactly I asked you on that point you always supported Iron Dome which is the Messala system but you go just voted against more money for it why because a ceasefire is what we should prioritize now what we cease fire protects civilians on both sides it doesn't just say we're only concerned about people on one side I am because I've been a stroke I have stood with those people talk about those rockets in that indiscriminate rocket fire and I've also been to Gaza three times since 2009 and I think those people are absolutely devastated we need a peaceful fire now okay so the way that he wants to ceasefire is by removing Israel's protection from indiscriminate rocket attack that's Keith Ellison the guy they're talking about for head of the DNC just a couple of months ago he wrote in The Washington Post quote as I've talked with ordinary Gosselin's I have not encountered anyone representing Hamas the Gaza Strip is literally run by the terrorist group Hamas Ellison openly associate with the campaign to end the Israeli occupation which is a virulent ly anti-israel interest group that labels Democrats like Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer is Democrat right and Israel Ferster Democrats by the way will not talk about this he won't talk about this he's been avoiding interviews for literally weeks now Josh crash our National Journal he tweeted this morning temps really don't want to talk about Ellison's record on Israel no comments at once Schumer a lie many stories avoiding elephant in the room right meanwhile the the anti-defamation league which has done yeoman's work on criticizing the all right they have nothing to say about keith Ellison and the fact that the leader of the DNC may be this guy who's openly associated with anti-semites and in fact has engaged in openly anti-semitic behavior here was the statement from Jonathan Greenblatt Greenblatt by the way I've met him nice guy but Jonathan Greenblatt was a was an Obama staffer okay and here's what here's the statement from the ADL quote we spoke with the leadership in the Jewish community in Minnesota who confirmed what ADL and other national organization organizations have seen that keith Ellison is a man of good character we have seen him through his work in Congress as an important ally in the fight against the anti-semitism and for civil rights nonsense nonsense nonsense he's been on the record in support of Israel hahahaha and supports a two-state solution however the congressman has also made statements and taken positions especially regarding the israeli-palestinian conflicts and on the jcpoa that would be the the Iranian agreement on which we strongly differ and that concern us we hope that candidates for this post will make clear where they stand on these issues and that the Democratic National Committee will make a choice that affirms the long-standing bipartisan consensus to a strong us-israel relationship in addition we want to make clear to those who disagree with congressman Allison that in doing so there's no room for innuendo or slander because of his race or faith it's not about his race or faith it has everything to do with his views and the views that he is openly espoused right but but again left-wing Jews are not criticizing Ellison they're criticizing the alt-right only and you got a bunch of people in the media who are completely ignoring the fact that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and the entire left wing of the Democratic Party are supporting for the head of the DNC a guy who's interested in doubling down on identity politics and who also has spent his entire adult life associating with the worst kinds of vile anti-semitism you can imagine right again these people are all over Steve Bannon which is okay but they are completely leaving the lone keith Ellison and I do want to point out here that there's a mistake that people on both sides seem to make and that is they play the double standard game they say well you know they're focusing on banner but they're not focusing on Ellison therefore we shouldn't focus on Bennett no that's not the proper conclusion the proper conclusion is you should focus on Bannon and you should focus on Ellison by the way Ellison is a significantly more dangerous character then Bannon is with regard to his views that is just a cynical opportunist who's willing to use the alt-right to get where he wants to go Ellison is somebody who actually believes all these things right me somebody who spent his time in the night he's calling himself Keith X Ellison because he was an actual member of the Nation of Islam and the media have nothing to say about it the point of the double standard argument should be to restore the standard not to tear it down the point of saying why aren't you covering X when you're covering Y is not to say you shouldn't cover Y it's saying you should cover all of it but again people tend not to buy into that because everybody's a partisan unfortunately now the Democrats are falling apart over this stuff because a lot of them are saying like congressman Tim Ryan from Ohio why are we doubling down on the identity politics that just lost us this election that are leading to ever-increasing numbers of white folks in the rural areas running away from the Democratic Party and running instead toward the Republicans and then you've got people saying we've got to double down on the gal that brung us we're building this new coalition the demographics favored us we've got to double down on the identity politics the Democrats are tearing themselves apart and they're becoming in the process a regional party a party that only exists in California and New York and some major cities around the country but nowhere in the rural areas the entire middle of the country is basically now red with the section of Illinois and that's an amazing thing and look at the map it's pretty incredible but the Democrats do have one hope and that hope is that Donald Trump is a complete crap show that's that's their hope here and Elijah Cummings basically says that he says you know while he's trying to figure out what the strategy ought to be he's saying well Trump's business is a minefield for conflicts the president can't have a conflict of interest is that problematic in your view it is problematic because clearly I don't think mr. Trump realizes how significant the the minefield is in this area keep in mind wolf that during the campaign he said one of his top priorities would be to bring honesty to government he also talked about draining the swamp and and used a lot of terms basically saying that he was going to clean up government and he was going to make sure that there would be transparency when you have you're dealing in so many with so many businesses in so many countries it's basically a minefield for conflicts and to say that because you are the president that the law does not apply to you it's not so much just the law it is the appearance of conflict okay so Cummings here is basically saying we're banking on Trump to blow this thing and if you're rooting for Trump to actually be a successful president to do good things particularly conservatives if you're betting on him to do good things you want him to stop doing the stuff where he's associating his business interests the only hope for the Democrats is that Trump disgraces himself and then they come back because 2018 the map looks terrible for Democrats in the Senate it looks awful for them they have a bunch of vulnerable seats in red areas they're gonna lose a lot of senators they're gonna lose six to eight senators in 2018 it's a disaster area for them unless Trump blows this almost Trump blows this you have to be rooting instead for Trump to actually get his act together and that means holding him to the same standards which you'd hold Hillary Clinton if you were able to portray rightly Hillary Clinton is a corrupt ik rat you do not get to turn around and then proclaim that Trump is clean as the driven snow appear as the driven snow when he's intermingling his business assets and his presidency and even the appearance of that is something that should be shunned and there's an article today we mentioned it a couple of days ago there's talk that Trump had gotten on a call with the President of Argentina and the President of Argentina had called to congratulate him and Trump had brought up his permit for Trump Tower in Argentina and both sides denied it today that permit went through today that permit went through so if nothing was said that's just a giant coincidence this kind of stuff does not look good and it's going to it's gonna allow Democrats to drag Trump through the mud rightly or wrongly because where there is smoke there usually is fire now before we go any further I gotta got a signal to our our other advertiser's D s t LD d s t LD comms distilled calm these folks make jeans and the jeans are terrific so instead of buying $200 jeans or $100 jeans and distilled you can get these jeans for like 65 bucks a pair and they have many different types of jeans the material is really is really friendly to your to your skin I will say it is they fit really well and again you can get two pairs of jeans for the same price that you get one someplace else they're really terrific they don't waste material they are environmentally friendly for those who care about that sort of thing it's DST LD calm and if you use slash been DST LD calm slash been and get $10 off right now they also have a new line of fall jackets as well that you can check out they don't work with middlemen which is why they can do this so cheaply this is high-end denim it's it's really good stuff I own a pair and I'm buying another pair DST LD comm slash Ben for $10 off your first order okay so now on to what Trump is actually what Trump is actually doing so he's made a bunch of cabinet picks in the last 24 hours one of them makes I think a whole world of sense for him politically it doesn't necessarily make sense in terms of the job but it makes a lot of sense politically and that is the choice of nikki Haley for you an ambassador so the governor of South Carolina Trump has now picked her for UN Ambassador and she is going to she's going to accept this makes sense for a number of reasons first of all does she have any foreign policy experience nothing not really mm-hmm you know at the UN your entire job basically consists of just yelling at other useless people at the UN so that doesn't necessarily require anybody with great foreign policy chops as governor of South Carolina she did stand strong with Israel against the boycott the sanctions movement that is worth noting but the real reason that trump appointed her is pretty obvious one it gets rid of a potential rival if he does a bad job and someone's gonna primary him it could be somebody like nikki Haley - it gets rid of these charges of racism people have been saying his cabinet is filled with white men nikki Haley is a woman of Indian descent as Ann Coulter has made eminently clear and and Donald and Donald Trump is attempting to sort of get past the alt-right thing by appointing a woman of Indian descent third it actually has the effect of elevating Trump allies so even though nikki Haley was not a strong Trump Ally she critiqued Trump a lot during the campaign criticized him a lot the person who is the lieutenant governor of South Carolina will now become the governor is a guy named Henry McMaster McMaster was a huge Trump supporter throughout the primaries endorsed him as early as January even before the first primaries were held in Iowa finally it makes Trump look a little bit more broad-minded than he probably is because it looks like he's bringing someone in who disagrees with him about foreign policy again the reason I say that that's exaggerated is because you an ambassador doesn't really have much of a say if he picks him at Romney for Secretary of State then you start to change your calculus about the kind of administration he's gonna run maybe he's gonna bring in some people who disagree so that's one of his cabinet picks you want to hear me talk about the rest of his cabinet picks however you'll have to go over to Daley wire.com right now and become a subscriber $8 a month we'll get you your subscription you can become part of the mailbag today we're gonna do a live mailbag in just about 20 minutes here i'm ben shapiro show we usually do it on thursdays tomorrow's Thanksgiving if you're an annual subscriber then you got a free copy of my novel signed by me and you also get the ads removed and from the website and all the rest of it you get Andrew clavin's show as well you get that live you get to be part of his mailbag and we're adding new goodies all the time and go to daily wired.com right now to become a subscriber and we are the largest conservative podcast in the nation you
