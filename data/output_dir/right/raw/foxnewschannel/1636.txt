1
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:04,169
CHINA MAY BE INTERFERING BUT HE

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:06,572
SAID HE HAS A GREAT RELATIONSHIP

3
00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:08,106
WITH PRESIDENT XI.

4
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:10,876
EARLIER I SPOKE TO THE KENTUCKY

5
00:00:10,876 --> 00:00:11,977
SENATOR RAND PAUL AND ASKED WHAT

6
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:14,613
HE THINKS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT

7
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:17,216
SAYING THE LIBYA MODEL WON'T BE

8
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:17,916
REPEATED IN NORTH KOREA AND

9
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,252
OTHER TOPICS AS WELL.

10
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:22,621
>> IT WOULD BE DISCONCERTING TO

11
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:24,356
NORTH KOREA TO SEE THE LIBYA

12
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:24,690
EXAMPLE.

13
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,458
I HOPE THERE IS A DEAL IN NORTH

14
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:26,759
KOREA.

15
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:30,596
I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO REASSURE

16
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:32,331
THEM, YES, THIS WILL BE

17
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:35,401
DIFFERENT THAN LIBYA.

18
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:39,672
IF YOU GIVE UP YOUR NUCLEAR

19
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,707
CAPABILITIES, THERE AND PEACE

20
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:44,977
AND LIKELIHOOD PROSPERITY.

21
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:45,678
>> Martha: CONCERNED AT ALL

22
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,813
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT SAYING WE

23
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:49,014
WOULD OFFER PROTECTION FOR HIM?

24
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:57,690
>> THAT I  MAY BE OVER-STATING

25
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,891
THE CASE.

26
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:04,096
THE WEST AFFECTED REGIME CHANGE

27
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,297
IN LIBYA.

28
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:06,632
IRAN AND NORTH KOREA WONDER

29
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:10,736
ABOUT OUR SINCERITY.

30
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:13,272
SOME OF US ARGUED IT WAS A BAD

31
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:15,474
IDEA TO GET OUT OF THE IRAN

32
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:17,009
AGREEMENT BECAUSE IT SEND A

33
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,512
MESSAGE WE ARE NOT CONSISTENT

34
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:21,647
WITH YOUR AGREEMENTS.

35
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:26,752
>> Martha: YOU VOTED AGAINST

36
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:27,186
GINA HASPEL.

37
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:29,021
WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS NOW THAT

38
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:31,724
SHE WILL BE THE CIA DIRECTOR?

39
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,625
>> THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS GETS

40
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,595
CANDIDATES TO SAY THINGS THEY

41
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:37,996
HAVE NOT SAY PREVIOUSLY.

42
00:01:37,996 --> 00:01:40,966
SHE SAID WATER BOARDING DID NOT

43
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:41,333
WORK.

44
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,469
SHE NEVER SAID IT WAS IMMORAL

45
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,537
BUT CLOSER TO WHERE A LOST US

46
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:46,972
THINK WE OUGHT TO BE.

47
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:49,208
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE AS A

48
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,509
PEOPLE.

49
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,711
TORTURE AND WATER BOARDING IS

50
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:55,114
WHAT NOT WE SHOULD BE DOING.

51
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:57,416
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE POINTS

52
00:01:57,416 --> 00:02:00,786
THAT TRUMP WAS SURVEILED.

53
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:04,556
SHE DENIED THAT THE CIA HAD

54
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:06,759
ANYTHING TO DO WITH BRITISH

55
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:07,192
INTELLIGENCE.

56
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:10,095
SHE SAID TO ME THERE WAS NO

57
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:11,196
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE

58
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:15,768
BRITISH INTELLIGENCE AND JOHN

59
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:16,835
BRENNAN GIVING THEM INFORMATION

60
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,637
ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

61
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:20,072
THAT CONTRADICTS NEWS REPORTS.

62
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:21,874
I HOPE IT'S TRUE AND I HOPE SHE

63
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:25,344
WILL PUT IT IN WRITING.

64
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:29,014
TODAY SHE DENIED THERE WAS A

65
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:31,350
MEETING WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT

66
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,217
SURVEILLANCE OF THE TRUMP

67
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:35,487
CAMPAIGN WAS TRANSFERRED.

68
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:36,722
>> Martha: THAT WAS AN

69
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:39,024
INTERESTING EXCHANGE.

70
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:41,794
ARE YOU DISTURBED BY THE "NEW

71
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,829
YORK TIMES" PIECE SAID THERE WAS

72
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,264
A COUNTER-TERRORISM

73
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:46,398
INVESTIGATION OPENED UP BECAUSE

74
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:50,035
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CRIMINAL

75
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:51,587
CHARGE

76
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:52,171
CHARG

77
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:52,504
CHARGE?

78
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:53,772
>> I HAVE BEEN TROUBLED FROM THE

79
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:54,139
BEGINNING.

80
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:56,842
I THINK PEOPLE WERE DISHONEST IN

81
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:58,977
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY TO GO

82
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:01,446
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP BASED ON A

83
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:03,482
DOSSIER PAID BY THE CLINTON

84
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:05,617
COMPAIN AND DIDN'T TELL THE

85
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:06,285
JUDGE THAT.

86
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:09,955
THAT SOUNDS LIKE LYING FROM A

87
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:13,058
GET GO AND AN AGENCY RUN AMUCK

88
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:15,861
WITH FEELINGS OF HATRED AT THE

89
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:16,228
PRESIDENT.

90
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:17,896
I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT BIAS

91
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:18,730
AT THE CIA.

92
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,399
>> Martha: YOU CAME UP WITH A

93
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,602
BILL THAT WOULD BALANCE THE

94
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:28,874
BUDGET AND CUT BUDGET BY 13

95
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:31,643
BILLY DONOVAN OVER 10 YEARS.

96
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:33,912
-- BILLION DOLLARS OVER 10

97
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:34,646
YEARS.

98
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:36,882
ONLY 21 SENATORS VOTED FOR THE

99
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:39,518
BALANCED BUDGET DEAL.

100
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:42,554
>> HEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM.

101
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:45,023
THE REPUBLICANS GO HOME TO THE

102
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:47,276
ROTTAR'S

103
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:47,993
ROTTAR'

104
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:52,497
ROTTAR'S -- ROTARY CLUB AND SAY

105
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:55,734
I AM FOR THE BALANCED BUDGET.

106
00:03:55,734 --> 00:04:02,441
THEY PROMISEED TO REPEAL

107
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:02,808
OBAMACARE.

108
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:04,910
NOW 30 WOULD NOT VOTE FOR A

109
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,215
BUDGET THAT BALANCES IN 5 YEARS.

110
00:04:10,215 --> 00:04:16,755
ONLY 32-BILLION DOLLARS PER

111
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:17,055
YEAR.

112
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:22,961
13 BILLION DOLLARS IS AGAINST

113
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,263
IMPOSED INCREASES.

114
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,298
THAT'S ONLY 1% A YEAR.

115
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:30,502
>> Martha: ANYONE THAT SURPRISED

116
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:32,905
YOU IN THAT VOTE?

117
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,340
LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID IT WOULD

118
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,876
DECIMATE DEFENSE SPENDING.

119
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:39,511
DID ANYONE SURPRISE YOU WITH

120
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,446
THEIR VOTES?

121
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:43,749
>> NO, LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID IT

122
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:44,983
WOULD AFFECT THE DEFENSE.

123
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:46,151
IT HAD NO CUTS IN DEFENSE.

124
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:48,320
IT SAID YOU HAVE TO CUT 1% OF

125
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,254
THE TOTAL.

126
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:51,123
BUT THE COMMITTEES COULD DECIDE

127
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,025
WHERE TO CUT IT.

128
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,093
THOSE COMMITTEES COULD HAVE SAID

129
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:58,130
IT WOULD BE THE DEFENSE.

130
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,364
THAT'S UNLIKELY SINCE THE

131
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:00,098
REPUBLICANS CONTROL AND DON'T

132
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:01,633
WANT TO CUT DEFENSE.

133
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:04,202
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT MILITARY AND

134
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:06,405
NON-MILITARY AND ENTITLEMENTS.

135
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:10,375
IF YOU CUT ONE PENNY OUT OF THE

136
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,843
DOLLAR IT WOULD BALANCE.

137
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:14,880
THIS SHOWS THE HYPOCRISY OF

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,749
REPUBLICANS WHO SAY THEY ARE FOR

139
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:20,686
BALANCED BUDGET BUT UNWILLING TO

140
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:22,287
TAKE THE TOUGH VOTE.

141
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:27,259
>> Martha: SO NO ONE SURPRISED

142
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:27,526
YOU?

143
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:29,628
>> NO, THEY ARE KEEPING IT LIKE

144
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:31,229
WE HAD UNDER THE DEMOCRATS.

145
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:33,899
THAT'S THE DISAPPOINTING THING.

146
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:36,435
WE PROMISED THEM TO BE BETTER.

147
00:05:36,435 --> 00:00:00,000
THE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS
