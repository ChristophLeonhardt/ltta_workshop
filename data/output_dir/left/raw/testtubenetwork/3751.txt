00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,730
Costa Rica has officially been named the happiest
place to live in the world by The Happy Planet

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,890
Index.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,750
The study compiled data from 151 different
countries to measure where people are living

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,070
happy, sustainable lives.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:17,400
So, exactly how does one measure happiness,
and does living happily really matter?

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,540
The HPI looks at three different factors to
determine if people are happy in a certain

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,540
country.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,490
First, it looks at general well-being, by
studying a Gallup World Poll that uses the

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,320
“Ladder of Life” method.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,360
The poll asks people to rate their life on
a scale of 0-10, with 0 being the worst possible

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,300
life and 10 being the best.

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,340
Denmark, Canada and Norway finished in the
top three with Togo coming in last.

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,300
Then they take that number and multiply it
by each country’s life expectancy using

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,660
data from a 2011 United Nations study.

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,700
Japan has the highest at nearly 84 years - almost
twice that of Sierra Leone, which has the

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,770
lowest life expectancy at only 47.8 years.

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,320
The study also factors in each country's ecological
footprint.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,890
This statistic is important to the HPI because
it’s directly connected to the sustainability

19
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,150
of a country’s happiness - as a country
becomes more polluted and less able to produce

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,790
resources like food, the less likely it is
that they’ll have a good or long life.

21
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,800
To get their final scores, they take the Ladder
of Life average, multiplied by life expectancy,

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,820
and divide that by the ecological footprint.

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,780
So, that’s how Costa Rica, Vietnam, and
Colombia were named the happiest places in

24
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,860
the world to live.

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,160
But, is this an accurate assessment?

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,980
Are they happier than other nations?

27
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,480
Well, I guess it depends on how you define
happy.

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,120
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development declared Australia as the

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,210
happiest country, based on eleven different
statistics like education, personal security

30
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,210
and income.

31
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:52,090
A 2013 report by the UN listed Denmark at
the top, using GDP, life expectancy, and corruption

32
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,020
levels - among other things.

33
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,640
Or maybe you judge happiness on topics not
being covered, like homicide rates, unemployment

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
or gun rights.

35
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,310
See, that’s the problem with ranking countries
by happiness.

36
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,950
Happiness is subjective, and one that we may
not be able to accurately track across all

37
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,949
countries.

38
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,490
But that obviously isn’t going to stop anyone
from trying.

39
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,060
In fact, the UN thinks tracking happiness
is so important that they passed a resolution

40
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,750
on it in 2011, saying that countries now need
to start tracking happiness.

41
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,980
And as far as criteria for happiness goes,
the Happy Planet Index is pretty simple.

42
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,810
They asked people if they were happy, looked
at how long those people were potentially

43
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,150
going to live, and then divided that by how
sustainable their environment is.

44
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,310
If you feel those are three important qualifications
for being happy, then maybe it’s time to

45
00:02:38,310 --> 00:00:00,000
pack your bags and move to Costa Rica.
