1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,808


2
00:00:02,808 --> 00:00:08,300
[Singing] Walk with me, Lord.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,484
Lord, walk with me.

4
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:17,957
Walk with me, Lord.

5
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:20,939
Lord, walk with me.

6
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,921


7
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:34,855
While I'm on this
tedious journey,

8
00:00:34,855 --> 00:00:43,728
I want Jesus to walk with me.

9
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:48,420


10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,870
Tropical storm Harvey is
pummeling southern Texas.

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,850
We're live here in Houston where
Harvey's rains keep coming.

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,475
It's not the initial impact, but
the flooding that will follow.

13
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:58,260
Record-shattering
rain, massive flooding.

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,460
Families stranded.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,750
Waters keep rising.

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,010
This is just the beginning.

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,170
Hi, if anybody's out there
and can hear us, please help.

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,260
I need a rescue.

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,500
These are three kids,
no food or water.

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,659
Do we have anyone in
the Friendship area?

21
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:12,325
Friendship area.

22
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:13,206
Where's that Humble address at?

23
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,610
What's the Humble
address where they're

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,255
trying to let the boats get in?

25
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:16,530
There's been a report
of another five foot

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,196
of water about to
pour out of Baker Dam.

27
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:19,545
In Normandy, we need help.

28
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:21,295
Families are going
under with the current.

29
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:21,680
The boats are capsizing.

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,065
We need strong boats.

31
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:22,944
I-10, Normandy.

32
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,110
Families are on these boats.

33
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:24,390
They're all going under.

34
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,800
They need boats out there.

35
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,200
They say a white truck
went under the water.

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,990
So, and I'm like,
well, it can't be him

37
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,448
because he was
heading to my house.

38
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:34,440
Also I kept calling
his wife, dialing 911,

39
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,320
and no response I kept
calling him, no response

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,820
Hi ma'am.

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,592
This is Texas game
warden Carmen Rickel.

42
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:42,050
It's my understanding
that you guys

43
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,050
have called to be evacuated
from your residence?

44
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,420
Is that correct?

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,760
Do you know the condition of
the water around the house?

46
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,100
I don't know the answer.

47
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,600
Stand by.

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,480
We're going to try to get
somebody out there to help you.

49
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,650
We don't get names.

50
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,180
We just get the call.

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,010
Sometimes that's all you get.

52
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,174
A quick two second, I
need help, I need help!

53
00:01:59,174 --> 00:02:00,090
And the call hangs up.

54
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,090
And that's all you have.

55
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,370


56
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,440
The truck had been carried out
by the currents of the water

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,250
and had gone on under the water.

58
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,180
Of course, you're still
just praying and hoping

59
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,490
that you know, it's not
them, or the truck went over.

60
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,840
That they got out.

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,420


62
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,570
Midday, a call comes
in that there's

63
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,690
a vehicle that's being
swept away by water

64
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,180
and that the call, they
can hear screaming.

65
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,700
And people who are
in major distress.

66
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,960
For everybody standing around
here, listening to that call,

67
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,310
it's just not easy to process.

68
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,518
I mean, you're having to
work through something where

69
00:02:45,518 --> 00:02:47,120
two people did not make it.

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,180
And I hear somebody talk
about a pastor and his wife

71
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,030
who had been in a vehicle
that were swept away.

72
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,490
And whether or not those are the
same two people, I don't know.

73
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,120
Fort Bend deputies are
clearing this scene

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,810
where they recovered earlier
today the bodies of a married

75
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,300
couple in their 60s.

76
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,410
Those two people driving
down Pool Hill Road

77
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,500
here hit that high water,
and were submerged.

78
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,300
One of the victims
was on the phone

79
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,560
pleading for help with 911
when the phone went dead.

80
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,900
Thank God they were
able to pull them

81
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,010
out so that their bodies
just didn't float.

82
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,870


83
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,480
It was -- it was
definitely them.

84
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,070
And it was just hard.

85
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,850
And they just told us, you
can't -- you can't faint.

86
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,760
You can't -- you know,
you have to be strong.

87
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,505
And you're just thinking in that
moment, Lord, give me strength.

88
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,130
Because how are you
going to be strong?

89
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,255
You're seeing your parents.

90
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:53,515
And I couldn't wrap my mind
around how this happened.

91
00:03:53,515 --> 00:04:10,504


92
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:12,959
[Phone rings]

93
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:13,941
Yes, ma'am.

94
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:16,910


95
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,160
You are under a
mandatory evacuation.

96
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,560
They don't know what
this water's going to do.

97
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,819
It may recede, it may go up.

98
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:23,360
I don't know.

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,810
I'm not --

100
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,960
It's gone down quite a bit.

101
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,840
Well, I have a boat out
front that I can take you.

102
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,090
There's other issues involved.

103
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,030
Tell me, tell me.

104
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,681
Well, I'm a cancer patient.

105
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:32,180
Yes sir.

106
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,470
And I'm just post-transplant.

107
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,100
Yes sir.

108
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,460
I can't be around
a bunch of people.

109
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,673
It would be extremely difficult
for me to leave right now.

110
00:04:40,673 --> 00:04:44,300
Extremely difficult. And
dangerous for my health.

111
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,332
As is staying.

112
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:47,290
You understand, this area
that we're working in

113
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,206
is below the dams that
they've been releasing.

114
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,020
As of a few days
ago, the intel we had

115
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,660
was that they were going to have
to release at the current rate

116
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,696
for upwards of three weeks.

117
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:56,196
Uh-huh.

118
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,620
O.K. With the
potential they would

119
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,726
have to increase that flow.

120
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:01,130
O.K.?

121
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,070
As difficult as it is for us
to leave that house knowing

122
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,050
that if that flood
or that levee breaks,

123
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,890
or the rain continues, that more
than likely that they are going

124
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,557
to be in a really bad spot.

125
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:12,890
I mean, we just have to move on.

126
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,930
Because there's so
many people to help.

127
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,540
Millions waking up to a
scene of epic flooding.

128
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,990
Never seen anything like this.

129
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,330
50 inches of rain.

130
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,280
We need help out here,
because it's starting

131
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,140
to rain and thunder again.

132
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,720
And, we can't take anymore rain.

133
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,590
Officials are very
concerned that the death

134
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,910
toll will be rising.

135
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,740
Don't take shelter
in your attic.

136
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,110
Get an ax and break
through your roof

137
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,812
so rescue workers might see you.

138
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:37,020
There are new concerns over
the fallout of a chemical

139
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,519
explosion.

140
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,220
Hurricane Harvey continues to
wreak climate chaos in Houston.

141
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,720
A group of people
forming a human chain

142
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,950
to try and rescue an elderly
man who was being swept away

143
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,362
by the flood waters in his car.

144
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:48,710
Hopefully, today, we'll
get to the rest of you.

145
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,168
Please, please
don't give up on us.

146
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:53,145
I mean, they must
be rescuing people

147
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,290
in countless, countless
houses in this neighborhood.

148
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,972
Because we've been
hearing this noise

149
00:05:57,972 --> 00:05:59,180
for the past couple of hours.

150
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,100
And it has not stopped.

151
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,870
And the rain is starting again.

152
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:15,110


153
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,181
The water really beginning to
recede in a number of areas

154
00:06:18,181 --> 00:06:18,680
here.

155
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,280
We're going to be O.K., but it's
going to take time to rebuild.

156
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,690
Yes, there's a lot of
heartbreak right now.

157
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,610
But we are Texans.

158
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,610
We will help each other.

159
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,840
If you need something,
call, and we'll

160
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,340
try to get you
whatever help we can.

161
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,650
The fourth largest city
in the United States,

162
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,480
the results are devastating.

163
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,030


164
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,160
The number of people that
game wardens have rescued

165
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,330
is going to be in the thousands,
just from Fort Bend County.

166
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,480
At the end of the day, when we
were finally done, of course,

167
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,302
we wait for every game warden to
come back from their last call.

168
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:52,510
And so things are kind of
quieting down a little bit.

169
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,110
We're just wrapping up
numbers, wrapping up calls.

170
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,650
When it's finally time to
get in your truck and leave,

171
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,250
there's that moment of
silence when you just breathe.

172
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:09,088


173
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:12,350
The actual funeral's going to
be at the St. Paul Missionary

174
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,430
Church in Brookshire.

175
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,714
Yeah, on the 9th.

176
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:19,990


177
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,370
Yeah, we're doing
O.K., just trying

178
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,710
to take it a day at a time.

179
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,210
And people who -- people we
don't even know are helping

180
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:27,710
out.

181
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,750
It's really -- I mean,
it's really emotional.

182
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,260
It was really beautiful.

183
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,280
I don't even know how to
really respond to them.

184
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,510
These types of tragedies,
they pull people together.

185
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,380
I mean, just the amount of
support that we've gotten,

186
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,800
people wanting to help from,
not only all over this nation,

187
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,960
but people around the world.

188
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,790
I don't have time to sit at
home and lie in the bed and cry.

189
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,540
I have a mission.

190
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,820
I have work to do.

191
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,660
You know, we all do.

192
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,480
That's the point.

193
00:08:00,480 --> 00:00:00,000
