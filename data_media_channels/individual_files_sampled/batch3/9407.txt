ME TOO MOVEMENT. THIS IS "SPECIAL REPORT" ." GOOD EVENING. WELCOME TO WASHINGTON. I'M SHANNON BREAM IN FOR BRET BAIER. WOULD BEGIN WITH A HYPOTHETICAL THAT IS CAUSING SOME VERY REAL CONCERN ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL, AND THE CONSTITUTION. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE HAS THE RIGHT TO PARDON HIMSELF SHOULD THE RUSSIA CUSHION PROBE MAKE IT NECESSARY BUT HE SAYS THERE WILL BE NO NEED SINCE THERE IS IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND HE IS INNOCENT. GOOD EVENING, JOHN ROBERTS. A WEEK FROM TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP US HAD TO SIT DOWN FOR A HISTORIC SUMMIT WITH THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA, BUT EVEN AS HE PREPARES FOR THAT MEETING, PRESIDENT STILL VERY MUCH HAS THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION ON HIS MIND. PRESIDENT TRUMP BEGAN HIS 500TH DAY IN OFFICE BY IGNITING A FIRESTORM OF LEGAL AND POLITICAL DEBATE. DIVING BACK INTO THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. ANY BREAKFAST WHEAT, INSISTING, AS HAS BEEN STATED BY NUMEROUS LEGAL SCHOLARS, I HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO PARDON MYSELF BUT WHY WOULD I DO THAT WHEN I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG? IN A CONFERENCE CALL WITH SUPPORTERS, PRESIDENT TRUMP DOUBLE DOWN ON A MORNING TWEET THAT THE MUELLER PROBE IS TOTALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. President Trump: IT'S NOT EVEN CONSTITUTIONAL. IN MY OPINION. THE PARDON ISSUE SURFACED IN THE LETTER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OUTSIDE COUNSEL WROTE TO ROBERT MUELLER IN JANUARY, THE LETTER OBTAINED BY FOX NEWS LAID OUT MYRIAD REASONS WHY MUELLER HAS NO LEGAL STANDING TO ASK FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT. ATTORNEYS JOHN DOWD AND JAY SEKULOW ARGUE THE PRESIDENT COULD COME IF YOU WISH, TERMINATE THE INQUIRY OR EVEN EXERCISE HIS POWER TO PARDON. DEMOCRATS RUSHED TO SAY NO, HE COULDN'T. IT'S NOT THE RULE OF TRUMP. IT IS THE RULE OF LAW WE LIVE UNDER IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. EVEN IN 1974, RICHARD NIXON'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT NIXON COULD NOT PARDON HIMSELF. THE SAME THING IS TRUE HERE. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CURRENT OUTSIDE COUNSEL, RUDY JULIANA, SAYS THE PRESIDENT LIKELY DOES HAVE THE POWER PARTED HIMSELF THOUGH TO DO SO WOULD BE POLITICAL SUICIDE. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PARDONING HIMSELF WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE AND WOULD LEAD TO PROBABLY IMMEDIATE IMPEACHMENT. PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS ADDED THERE IS NO REASON FOR A PARDON. THE PRESIDENT HASN'T DONE ANYTHING AND TRICKLE WRONG AND WOULD NEED ONE. THE LETTER REIGNITED ANOTHER CONTROVERSY. WHAT ROLE DID THE PRESIDENT PLAY IN DRAFTING THE INITIAL STATEMENT FROM DONALD TRUMP JR. IN RESPONSE THAT 2016 MEETING WITH THE RUSSIAN ATTORNEY. A FOUR DAYS AFTER THE STATEMENT, OUTSIDE COUNSEL JAY SEKULOW SAID THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT INVOLVED. THAT WAS WRITTEN BY DONALD TRUMP JR. AND IMS WERE WITHIN CONSULTATION WITH HIS LAWYER. THE PRESS SECRETARY LATER SAID HE WAS INVOLVED BUT ONLY MARGINALLY. HE DIDN'T DICTATE. HE WEIGHED IN, OFFERED SUGGESTION LIKE ANY FATHER WOULD DO. THE JANUARY LETTER WRITTEN BY JAY SEKULOW CONTRADICTS BOTH OF THOSE STATEMENTS. IT INFORMS MUELLER YOU HAVE RECEIVED ALL OF THE NOTES, COMMUNICATIONS, AND TESTIMONY INDICATING THAT THE PRESIDENT DICTATED A SHORT BUT ACCURATE RESPONSE TO "THE NEW YORK TIMES" ARTICLE ON BEHALF OF HIS SON, DONALD TRUMP JR. GIULIANI BELIEVES PSYCHE S GIULIANI BELIEVES PSYCHE K GIULIANI BELIEVES PSYCHE L GIULIANI BELIEVES PSYCHE W MISSPOKE. I THINK HE WAS WRONG. THE PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEYS ARGUED THAT THE STATEMENT WAS A PRIVATE MATTER BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND "THE NEW YORK TIMES." A PRIVATE MATTER THAT ROBERT MUELLER HAS NO BUSINESS STICKING HIS NOSE INTO. GIULIANI ADDED YESTERDAY THAT HE
