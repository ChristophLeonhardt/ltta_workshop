ANYBODY ELSE ACTING IN A VIOLENT WAY TOWARDS OUR MEN AND WOMEN ON THE BORDER. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY AGENCIES OR DEPARTMENTS ARE UNDER YOUR JURISDICTION AS THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY, THAT INCLUDES COUNTERTERRORISM, PROTECTION OF NATIONAL LEADERS, CYBER AND AVIATION SECURITY, PROTECTION FROM BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS, BORDER SECURITY, DISASTER RESPONSE INCLUDING THE RESPONSE TO HURRICANES THAT JUST KEPT YOU VERY VERY, VERY BS KEPT YOU VERY VERY, VERY BY RECENTLY, BUT BUT WITH ALL THIS COMING THROUGH TO DEMOCRATIC LEADERS AND CNN, CAN YOU UPDATE US TO THE INVESTIGATION ON WHO THAT PIPE BOMBER MIGHT BE? SCI HAS THE LEAD ON THIS INVESTIGATION. WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM VERY CLOSELY RIGHT NOW, THE SECRET SERVICE HAS TAKEN ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO BE SURE TO PROTECT ALL OF THEY ARE PROTECTING US, WHICH SOME OF THE TEN PACKAGES WENT TO PROTECT HE IS, AS YOU KNOW. WE HAVE OUR FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE, ALSO IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, AND SOME ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FOR FEDERAL BUILDINGS FOR PRODUCTION. THEN JUST IN TERMS OF PEOPLE, PLACES AND THINGS, WE PUT OUT ALERTS TO THE GOVERNORS, ALL MEN SECURITY ADVISORS AND, EVERYONE BE PREPARED. WHAT ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION INTO THIS INDIVIDUAL, AND WHO THIS IS? I DON'T WANT TO IN ANY WAY HINDER THEIR INVESTIGATION SO I WON'T SAY MORE ABOUT AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION, BUT REST ASSURED THE PRESIDENT A PROPERLY DIRECTED EVERYONE WITHIN THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO WORK ON THIS AS QUICKLY AND EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE TO BRING THIS PEOPLE OR THIS PERSON TO JUSTICE. Martha: CAN YOU CONFIRM THERE WAS A PACKAGE Sec. Nielsen: I THINK THERE WERE SOME LEADS AND THE FBI IS TRACKING THEM ALL DOWN. AS YOU KNEEL, SOME OF THE PACKAGES WENT THROUGH THE MAIL, AND THAT IS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE FBI IS DOING AGAIN. Martha: DO YOU HAVE FEEL CONFIDENT WITH SOME OF THE MESSAGES THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO FIND THIS PERSON RELATIVELY QUICKLY? Sec. Nielsen: I'M CONFIDENT THAT THIS PERSON OR PEOPLE WILL BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. ABSOLUTELY. Martha: THANKS TO THE PRESIDENT'S OWN STRONG LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN CRITICIZED AND, SOME HAVE SUGGESTED IF IT WAS CREATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT LED TO THIS PIPE BOMB, TO THESE PIPE BOMB THREATS, AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ABOUT THAT? I WOULD SAY THAT A PERSON THAT RECOGNIZES ANY ACT OF VIOLENCE, ANY THREAT OF VIOLENCE CANNOT BE TOLERATED BY THIS COUNTRY. THE WAY WE LOOK AT THIS AT DHS, WE'VE EXPANDED OUR EFFORTS. HATE IS HATE, VIOLENCE IS VIOLENCE AND WE TRACKED DOWN ALL INSTANCES OF THAT, WHEREVER THEY APPEAR AND WHATEVER THE MOTIVE IS. WHETHER IT'S POLITICAL OR NOT POLITICAL. WITH ME THIS IS A CLEAR ATTEMPTS TO UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES, SO WE CAN'T STAND FOR IT. WE MUST BRING THESE PEOPLE TO JUSTICE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. Martha: IN TERMS OF THE PRESIDENT'S LANGUAGE WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT HAS BEEN A INTERVENING FACTOR? Sec. Nielsen: I THINK HE MADE CLEAR WHAT HE WANTS AND EXPECTS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
