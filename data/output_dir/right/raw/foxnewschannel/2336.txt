28
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:44,889

OTHER CABLE CHANNELS.

30
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,291

00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:59,403
IT WAS ALWAYS A FANTASY.

40
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:00,772
BY THE WAY, THE REPORT DOES

41
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:02,273

NEVER DISCUSSED THE STEELE

80
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,254
THAT'S UNTRUE.

81
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:51,923
THE REPORT REVEALED THAT

82
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:53,324

ABOUT THE STEELE DOSSIER AND

84
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:56,427
MONTHS LATER, OF COURSE, THE

85
00:01:56,427 --> 00:01:58,062
NETWORK HIRED HIM AS A

86
00:01:58,062 --> 00:01:58,462

87
00:01:58,462 --> 00:01:59,831

DISCUSS THE DOSSIER WITH THE

00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:13,477
AND SO ON IN THE CIRCULAR

98
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:14,312
FASHION WE HAVE BEEN

99
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:15,279

IN OTHER WORDS, THE WHOLE

101

THING WAS A SETUP FROM THE

102
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:18,349
BEGINNING.

103
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:19,150

104
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,451
DOES QUAY WAS TRUE OR CARED

105

IF IT WAS TRUE.

106
00:02:21,385 --> 00:02:22,954
IT WAS ALWAYS JUST A TOOL

107
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:25,189
DESIGNED TO HAMSTRING THE

108
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:25,957

111
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,127
TRUMP WAS ON TO THIS

112
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:31,162
ACTUALLY FROM THE BEGINNING.

113
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:32,563
HE COULDN'T REALLY EXPLAIN

114
00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:34,565
IT, BUT HE COULD SMELL IT,

115
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:35,700
WHICH IS HIS ONE GREAT

116
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,701
TALENT AND HE WAS RIGHT.

117
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:38,669
OF COURSE, HE WAS ATTACKED

118
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:39,637
MERCILESSLY FOR SUGGESTING

119
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:41,572

THE LEVEL.

122
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,575
HOW DARE HE DO THAT HE

123
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:46,177
YELPED ON CNN.

124
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:48,646
THEY ARE PUBLIC SERVANTS

125
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:49,814

SOME ARE GREAT PEOPLE.

SOME ROTTEN AND UNETHICAL.

132
00:02:56,988 --> 00:02:58,556
SOME WOULD USE LEAKS,

133
00:02:58,556 --> 00:03:00,725
DECEPTION AND INTEND DOUGH

134
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:01,926
TO REVERSE RESULTS OF AN

135

00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:03,594
MOST PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.

137
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:04,662
THIS THAT'S WHY THE PHRASE

138
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:06,163
DEEP STATE IS SUDDENLY PART

139
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:07,431
OF THE PUBLIC CONVERSATION.

140
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:08,633
JOHN BRENNAN IS PART OF THE

141
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:09,567
REASON BY THE WAY.

142
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:10,601
BRENNAN IS THE FORMER HEAD

143

00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:16,440
CLAMMER IS ENTHUSIASTIC

145
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,741
LIAR.

146
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:20,945

00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:22,647
SECOND CAREER AS LEGAL

148

ANALYST.

149
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,282
BRENNAN DENOUNCED THE ENTIRE

150
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:25,816
THING AS MEANINGLESS.

151
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:27,652
HE THEN SAID THIS ON TWITTER

152
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:28,653
DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT,

153
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:30,388
QUOTE THE:  THE SPECIAL

155
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:33,391
COMPREHENSIVE AND

AUTHORITATIVE, STAY TUNED,

157
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:35,493
MR. TRUMP.

158
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:37,495
HE AUDITED

159
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:38,663
HE AUDIT AN ELLIPSIS TO MAKE

160
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:40,298
IT EXTRA OMINOUS, WHICH IT

161
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:40,965
WAS.

162
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:41,265
OKAY.

163
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:43,868
SO THE LONG-TIME CHIEF OF A

164

TO HAPPEN TO HIM.

170
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:51,509
APPARENTLY BECAUSE JOHN

00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:52,677
BRENNAN HAS INSIDE KNOWLEDGE

172
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:54,011

00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:20,904
>> THEY FOUND AFTER A YEAR

196
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:21,939
OF RIGOROUS INVESTIGATION

197
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:23,274
THERE IS NO ACTUAL EVIDENCE

198
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:24,709
OF TREASONOUS COLLUSION

199
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:25,977
BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIAN

200
00:04:25,977 --> 00:04:26,377
GOVERNMENT.

201
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:27,745
THAT'S PROBABLY THOUGHT VERY

202
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:28,145
SURPRISING.

203
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:29,180
WHAT THEY DID SHOW WAS THAT

204
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,614
THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF

205
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:32,149
COLLUSION AT THE HIGHEST

206
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:33,384
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO COOK

207
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:35,186
UP AND PROPAGATE A NARRATIVE

208
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:36,454
OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION.

209
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:37,688
WE HAD ALREADY LEARNED FROM

210
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:39,590
THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT THE

211
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,459
FISA ABUSE AT DOJ WHERE THEY

212
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:42,760
USED A RESEARCH DOCUMENT

213
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,362
BOUGHT AND PAID FOR SECRETLY

214
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,263
BY HILLARY CLINTON AND THE

215
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:46,831
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL

216
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:47,965
COMMITTEE TO SECURE A

217
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:49,700
WIRETAP ON A TRUMP CAMPAIGN

218
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,067
AFFILIATE.

219
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:50,901
AND THEN YOU PICKED UP ON

220
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:52,737
THIS OTHER THING THAT'S

221
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:53,137
INTERESTING.

222
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:55,106
JAMES CLAPPER GAVE

223
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:55,706
CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY

224
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:56,941
UNDER OATH ABOUT WHAT HE WAS

225
00:04:56,941 --> 00:04:57,641
LEAKING TO CNN.

226
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,809
AND THAT IS INTERESTING.

227
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:00,277
THE WHOLE THING THAT GOT

228
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:02,513
EVERYTHING GOING WAS THIS

229
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:03,547
BRIEFING OF PRESIDENT-ELECT

230
00:05:03,547 --> 00:05:04,815
TRUMP, SUPPOSEDLY ABOUT THE

231
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:05,149
DOSSIER.

232
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:06,550
WE LATER LEARNED IT WAS ONLY

233
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,718
ABOUT ONE SALACIOUS PART OF

234
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:09,653
THE DOSSIER.

235
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:11,088
>> THIS WAS HIGHLY PLACED.

236
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:12,623
THIS WAS WELL-SOURCED.

237
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:12,990
OBVIOUSLY.

238
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,191
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WENT TO

239
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:15,626
CLAPPER OR SOMEONE CLOSE TO

240
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:16,794
HIM AND LEARNING THAT THIS

241
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:18,896
WAS ALL DONE, THAT COMEY WAS

242
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:19,897
ASKED TO BRIEF

243
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:20,865
PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP ON

244
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:22,066
THIS DOSSIER AND THAT THIS

245
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,235
WAS DONE BECAUSE CNN NEEDED

246
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:25,569
A NEWS HOOK IN ORDER TO

247
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:26,637
JUSTIFY WRITING ABOUT A

248
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:26,971
DOSSIER.

249
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:27,905
THAT IS A VERY INTERESTING

250
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:28,873
DETAIL TO LEARN AND SHOULD

251
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:29,940
PUT A LOT OF THE COVERAGE

252
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,442
THAT WE HAVE SEEN FOR THE

253
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:32,676
LAST 15 MONTHS IN AN

254
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:34,145
ENTIRELY NEW LIGHT.

255
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:35,312
>> Tucker: I MEAN, TERRY,

256
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:36,947
YOU SPENT A LOT OF YOUR LIFE

257
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:38,949
WORKING FOR THE FEDERAL

258
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:39,683
GOVERNMENT A LAW ENFORCEMENT

259
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:41,085
AGENCY THAT HAS INTELLIGENCE

260
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:41,919
COMPONENTS TO IT THE

261
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,120
CREDIBILITY OF THE AGENCY,

262
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,088
I'M SURE IS IMPORTANT TO

263
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:44,355
YOU.

264
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:45,623
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME AS AN

265
00:05:45,623 --> 00:05:46,157
AMERICAN CITIZEN.

266
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:47,458
NONE OF THIS SEEMS TO HELP.

267
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,026
I MEAN, IF THERE IS NO

268
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:49,827
COLLUSION AT THE BOTTOM OF

269
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:51,062
ALL OF THIS, THEN ALL OF

270
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:52,196
THIS IS STARTING TO LOOK

271
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:53,230
VERY POLITICAL AND THAT'S

272
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,098
BAD FOR THE WAY CITIZENS

273
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:55,299
FEEL ABOUT THEIR GOVERNMENT.

274
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:57,468
ISN'T IT?

275
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:58,769
>> ABSOLUTELY AND WHEN YOU

276
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:00,004
LOOK AT THIS, THE REAL

277
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:00,738
DANGEROUS PART OF THIS AND

278
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:01,972
THE PART THAT SHOULD SCARE

279
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:03,374
EVERY ONE OF US, YOU JUST

280
00:06:03,374 --> 00:06:03,874
NAMED THEM.

281
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:06,444
THE HEADS OF THE MAJOR

282
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:07,078
INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIVE

283
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:07,778
AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES,

284
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:09,914
THE CIA AND THE FBI AND THE

285
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:11,649
NSA, AWFUL THESE PEOPLE AT

286
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:13,117
THE TOP APPEAR TO HAVE HAD

287
00:06:13,117 --> 00:06:14,518
JUST ONE GOAL IN MIND.

288
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:16,320
AND THAT WAS TO BE

289
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,455
ANTI-TRUMP AND TO MAKE

290
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:18,389
TROUBLE FOR HIM AFTER HE

291
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:19,190
BECAME THE PRESIDENT.

292
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,758
I THINK IT'S REALLY

293
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:21,926
INTERESTING THAT ALL OF THIS

294
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:24,061
IDEA OF UNMASKING, FOR

295
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:25,629
EXAMPLE, DIDN'T REALLY START

296
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:27,064
UP UNTIL AFTER HE BECAME

297
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:27,398
ELECTED.

298
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,999
AND I THINK THAT EVERYBODY

299
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:30,234
THOUGHT AND I THINK MOLLIE

300
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:31,836
AND YOU AND I WOULD NOT BE

301
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:32,870
SITTING HERE TODAY AND

302
00:06:32,870 --> 00:00:00,000
TALKING HAD HILLARY CLINTON
