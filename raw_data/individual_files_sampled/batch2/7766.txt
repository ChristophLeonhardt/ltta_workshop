JOHN CONYERS IS A CIVIL RIGHTS ICON, I THINK IT'S FAIR TO CALL HIM A LEGEND IN CONGRESS. HE IS A LONGEST-SERVING MEMBER OF THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW, HE'S 88 YEARS OLD AND FOUGHT FOR MANY GREAT THINGS INCLUDING CIVIL RIGHTS AND MEDICARE FOR ALL BUT HIS CAREER HERE SEEMS TO BE COMING TO A VERY POOR ENDING AND ONE THAT APPEARS TO BE DESERVED. A NUMBER OF WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD AND SAID THEY HAD A SITUATION WITH JOHN CONYERS WHERE HE SEXUALLY HARASSED THEM. THEY WERE ANONYMOUS PARTLY BECAUSE THEY HAD SIGNED A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT BECAUSE OF ñ MARIANNE BROWN HAS BROKEN THAT SILENCE. SHE WORKED WITH JOHN CONYERS FOR A LONG TIME, SHE IS A LAWYER, INCREDIBLY BELIEVABLE, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT IT. HERE IS WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY ON TODAY SHOW. SOME OF THE THINGS HE DID, IT WAS SEXUAL HARASSMENT VIOLATING MY BODY, PROPOSITIONING ME, INVITING ME TO HOTELS WITH THE GUISE OF DISCUSSING BUSINESS AND THEN PROPOSITIONING ME TO FOR SEX. HE JUST VIOLATED MY BODY. HE HAS TOUCHED ME IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND IT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. IT IS SUPER DISHEARTENING TO HEAR BUT IT IS STILL IMPORTANT TO HEAR AND THE TRUTH IS WHAT IT IS. THE MATTER WHAT YOU WANT OR IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE, MORE FROM MARION BROWN. HE INVITED ME INTO THE HOTEL AND HE HAS UNDRESSED DOWN TO HIS UNDERWEAR, AGAIN IT WAS THE PROPOSITION OF SEXUALLY SATISFYING HIM. HE ASKED YOU TO DO SOMETHING SEXUALLY? YES. HE ASKED ME TO SATISFY HIM SEXUALLY. HE POINTED TO AREAS ñ GENERAL AREAS OF HIS BODY AND ASKED ME TO TOUCH IT. AND WHAT DID YOU DO IN THAT MOMENT? I WAS FROZEN SHOCK. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. BUT ONE THING I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE MY JOB, I DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET HIM AND I JUST ñ ALSO HE ASKED ME TO FIND OTHER PEOPLE THAT WOULD SATISFY HIM. TOUGH TO LISTEN TO. WE HAVE TO CALL OUT EVERYONE EQUALLY INCLUDING ALLIES. IT IS EASY TO CALL OUT PEOPLE LIKE ROGER AILES WHO HAD DONE DESPICABLE THINGS WITH THEIR PUBLIC POLICY AND THEIR POSITION IN POLITICS, THEN YOU FIND OUT THEY HAVE DONE ATROCIOUS THINGS BEHIND THE SCENES. HARDER TO CRITICIZE WHEN IT IS PEOPLE YOU THINK HAVE DONE GREAT WORK AND POLICY, BUT IT DOES NOT EXCUSE BEHAVIOR LIKE THIS BEHIND THE SCENES. FAIR IS FAIR AND WHAT SHE DESCRIBES IS HEARTBREAKING. ONE LAST CLIP HERE. WHAT DO YOU HOPE HAPPENS TO CONGRESSMAN CONYERS, AND YOU BELIEVE YOU SHOULD STEP DOWN AND RESIGN? I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT TO THE ETHICS COMMITTEE AND HIS COLLEAGUES. ALL I WANT FROM THE CONGRESSMAN IS FOR HIM TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT YOU DID AND APOLOGIZE FOR ME, TO ME FOR CALLING ME A LIAR. ALL THE PARTS BOTHER ME GREATLY BUT IF YOU'VE DONE THESE TERRIBLE THINGS AND THEN YOU GO AND CALL PEOPLE LIARS AND PUBLIC, THAT IS REALLY BAD. SHE'S NOT THE ONLY WOMAN TO HAVE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST CONYERS. THIS HAPPENED IN 2014, IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS FROM 30 YEARS AGO, NOT THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT BETTER. THEY HAD A SETTLEMENT IN 2015, SHE ADMITTEDLY BROKE THAT SETTLEMENT TO BE ABLE TO TELL HER STORY BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHER WOMEN WERE NOT INTIMIDATED AND DID NOT GO THROUGH THE SAME SITUATION. NOW JOHN CONYERS HAS BEEN HOSPITALIZED IN HIS HOME STATE OF MICHIGAN. SAM RIDDLE HIS SPOKESPERSON SAID THIS. I WOULDN'T GO IN THAT DIRECTION. THEY SAY IT IS FOR STRESS-RELATED REASONS, I DON'T KNOW I AM NOT 88. ATTACKING THE MEDIA IS A RIGHT-WING STRATEGY. IF THERE IS LEGITIMATE BIAS, YOU CALL THAT OUT AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE HERE. THEY REALLY ARE WOMEN HERE WHO ARE CHARGED VERY SIGNIFICANT WRONGDOINGS. AT THIS POINT HE HAS EVEN LOST NANCY PELOSI WHO HAS DEFENDED HIM JUST THIS SUNDAY. WHETHER THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST CONGRESSMAN CONYERS, WE HAVE LEARNED MORE SINCE SUNDAY, ARE SERIOUS, DISAPPOINTING, AND VERY CREDIBLE. IT IS VERY SAD. THE BRAVE WOMEN WHO CAME FORWARD RO JUSTICE. I PRAY FOR CONGRESSMAN CONYERS AND HIS FAMILY AND WISH THEM WELL. HOWEVER CONGRESSMAN CONYERS SHOULD RESIGN. UNFORTUNATELY HE SHOWED, AND NOW, THIS IS NOT CONFIRMED, BUT THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS IS ASKING HIM TO STEP DOWN, HE IS THE FOUNDER. AND EVEN OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS ICONS LIKE JIM CLYBOURN WHO IS IN THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP, HAS ALSO ASKED HIM TO STEP DOWN. A REALLY UNFORTUNATE BAD ENDING TO WHAT HAD BEEN A GREAT CAREER IN TERMS OF POLICY. BUT IT DOESN'T EXCUSE ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT IS YOUR ENEMIES ARE YOUR ALLIES, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE ANYWAY YOU SLICE IT. I THINK CONGRESSMAN CONYERS SHOULD STEP DOWN BUT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THE CAUSES HE BELIEVED IN EVEN IF WE NOW FIND OUT SOME OF THE THINGS HE DID BEHIND THE SCENES THAT WERE REPREHENSIBLE.
