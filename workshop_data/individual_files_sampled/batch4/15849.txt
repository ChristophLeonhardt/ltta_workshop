and you know what I didn't see in the Nebraska's regulators decision I didn't see any talk of social license or the fact that Alberta's carbon tax led them anywhere in their decision yeah absolutely a carbon tax which January 1st is about to go up substantially heating our homes and gas for our cars and substantially too for our oil and gas producers our concrete are fertilizer you know our manufacturers of methane X and methanol it's amazing that Neil the carbon tax is Friends of science calls that is all all pain and no gain I think it's only four tenths of one percent of the world that has a carbon tax and Sheila unfortunately that's us here in Alberta we're heating your home and driving distances or not options and and with carbon leakage people that design the NDP carbon tax have always stated the carbon leakage is a problem so if we lose our manufacturers to nearby jurisdictions that don't have a carbon tax we're gonna have just as much carbon in the atmosphere this is before we even debate whether carbon is a problem or not and we're going to lose all the economic benefits one of the things she loved that Stephen Harper and the federal Conservatives had exactly right is that Canada should not even consider a carbon tax into all of North America as one and of course we're seeing with Donald Trump in the direction in the United States when he substantially cut funding to the EPA and there's data that he's he's not so much into to do it and where we have to maintain our competitive advantage and it's back to the hypocrisy that we talked about about Rachel Notley originally not approving me or whining the Keystone pipeline here we are eliminating coal-fired electric generation at the cost of billions and billions of dollars to Alberta ratepayers and then thousands of jobs and thousands of jobs you're exactly right and at the same time we're selling cold to India and China so they can have you know I read 1402 to thousand more Coal Fired electric generated electricity plants and not in the next few years it just it just boggles your mind how we've got pushed off our competitive advantage of creating wealth that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
