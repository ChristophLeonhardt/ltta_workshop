Russian lawmakers are considering
harsher penalties for child sex abusers
it's after a series of extremely
disturbing allegations emerged from an
orphanage in the central city of
Chelyabinsk
I asked my son what they did with the
men who came to see them
my son was stunned and said we made
fried potatoes
I asked what else did he rape me that
was his answer I was lost for words I
called another mother she told me her
kids had the same story my son decided
to tell me everything he told me I was
so afraid they said they would drown me
in the lake would lock me up in the
rehab for the rest of my life
children say that one of the supervisors
who brought them to this man and his
friend just watch them being raped and
all the boys saw how they gave money to
the supervisors the small children
didn't even know what the banknotes were
so they just described them as green
bits of paper
mob suppression orders governing space
yes disrespect this is Nevada
when you below but Monsieur they're
ripping each other those kids they're
talking about it openly stay here until
the night and listen for herself what
they are talking about it vest cool

keys in him of something he didn't do
the director the orphanage let former
inmates into the school but stayed there
overnight they're the ones who did all
this with the kids and now they're just
protecting each other
Sookie complained about wrong burns at
the orphanage about beauties he was so
naive to do this he filed complaints

proper clothing but the older kids are

result of far-reaching investigation

carrying out assessments of all
orphanages in the Chelyabinsk region
