“Trump!
Trump!
Trump!
Trump!
Trump!”
“Not my president!
“Not my president!
Not my —”
“Hear these words.
You will never be ignored again.”
“On inauguration day, I
was looking for Richard,
because I hadn’t met him yet.”
“I’ve given conferences for
ages, and we’ll usually
expect some protesters.”
“I was going around
looking for them
and I was walking past that
limousine that was on fire.
I got a phone call from
somebody that’s like, hey,
did you just see
Richard got punched?”
“Pepe has become a symbol —”
“I was pissed off because
I was like, oh my god,
if I had already found him
or I was already there,
that wouldn’t have happened.
I need to meet up with
Richard to make sure
that that doesn’t happen again.
That’s when I —
I knew I had to get serious.
And I knew we had
to professionalize.”
“A year ago, if
you had asked me, what
would you have been doing?
You could have given
me a million guesses
and I wouldn’t
have told you this.
Essentially, I went from
being an anonymous Twitter troll
to being an activism
leader of the alt-right,
all in the span of about nine months.”
“You will
not replace us.
You will not replace us.
You will not replace us.”
“Identity politics for white
people is my immediate goal.
And getting alt-right people
to push from the online world
to the real world
and take up space.”
“I’m Eli Mosley here
representing Identity Evropa
and the American alt-right.
We are here today to show the
establishment of this country
that they will not
remove white symbols
in an act of white iconoclasm.
The anti-white policies
of the left and the right
in this country come
together to oppress
our people and our interests.”
“Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!”
“You will not stop us from
representing our interests.
You will not replace us.
You will not replace us.
You will not replace us.
You will not replace us.”
“It’s a far more
fulfilling life —”
“Shame!
Shame!”
“You’re anti-white!”
“— than going through the
motions of a life that could be
anybody’s.”
A little over a year
ago, Elliott Kline
was living a dual life.
In his day job, he was an
entry level H.R. administrator,
but online, he was a
far-right-wing Twitter troll
troll who called himself
“The Jew Hunter.”
Here he is in a
podcast when he thought
only an alt-right
audience was listening.
Just a warning, you’re about to
hear some extremely offensive language
“I work in H.R. firing
niggers and spics all day.
Before that, I was
in the Army and I
got to kill Muslims for fun.
I’m not sure which
one was better,
watching niggers
and spics cry that
can’t feed their
little mud children,
or watching Muslims’
brains sprayed on the wall.
Honestly, both
probably suck compared
to listening to a kike
scream while being ovened.”
His trolling name
was Eli Mosley,
after Oswald Mosley, a
British fascist leader
and admirer of Adolf Hitler.
“Hail Trump.
Hail our people.
Hail victory.”
As the Trump campaign gave
way to a polarizing victory
and white nationalists
started coming out in public,
"Back the  up!”
Eli Mosley stepped away from
his keyboard into real life.
“Let’s go, start
lighting your torches.
Start lighting your torches.”
“Jews will
not replace us.
Jews will not replace us.”
He became a lead organizer
of the Unite the Right rally 
in Charlottesville.
“I’m about to send at
least 200 people with guns
to go get them out —”
“This is where violent
clashes have broken out
between white nationalists
and counterprotesters.”
“New video, you see it
here, of that deadly car attack,
the driver, charged with murder.”
“I think there’s
blame on both sides
and I have no doubt about it.
And you don’t have any
doubt about it, either.”
While some fled the
movement after the violence
in Charlottesville,
Eli leaned in.
“We are done with DACA.
We elected Donald Trump to —”
Soon after, he was
named head of one
of the largest groups
in the alt-right,
called Identity Evropa.
He’s taken on the air
of a polished spokesman,
dressing up his
despicable language.
Eli is happy to engage
the media when he thinks
he controls the narrative.
A middle-class kid from
suburban Pennsylvania,
he had opportunities in life.
But he went to several
colleges and never graduated.
He served in the
National Guard, but quit
before his contract was up.
Now he’s on a path where
past failures don’t matter.
He’s leading others like him —
disaffected white men who found
each other in the dark corners
of the online world.
His mission, to repackage
a racist worldview
and sell it to the
American public.
“All right, fellas,
here’s the scoop.
We got different
types of sandwiches.
So what we’re going to do is
you’re just going to take one
and don’t open it,
and if you don’t like it,
trade with somebody
else on the bus, O.K.?
I see there’s turkey and
this says club, so who knows.”
“Oh, I wish I
was in the land of cotton.”
“Oh, I wish I
was in the land of cotton.”
“Old times
there are not forgotten.”
“Old times
there are not forgotten.”
“Look away, look
away, look away, Dixieland.”
“I wish I
was in Dixie, hooray, hooray.
In Dixie’s land I’ll take my
stand to live and die in Dixie.
Away, away, away
down south in Dixie.
Away, away, away, away
down south in Dixie.”
“All right, that was pretty good.
Do you want to do the
whole thing one more time?”
The alt-right’s basic strategy,
which they call “triggering,"
is to provoke a
reaction from the public
by stirring outrage and fear.
They think that if
their opponents then
respond aggressively,
even violently,
the alt-right may appear
less offensive in comparison.
Today, they’ve chosen
the ultimate trigger.
They’re returning
to the site where
they shook the nation
with a brazen display
of white supremacy.
They’re going back
to Charlottesville.
“Do not allow yourself
to get separated.
Do not allow yourself
to get isolated.
And even if you
do, do not panic.
The last time we
came to this city,
somebody got isolated
and shit got bad
and he panicked
when shit got bad.
And he is probably never going to leave
the state of Virginia alive.”
Some of these people were at
the last Charlottesville event.
And some are new recruits
still in their teens.
Some, like Eli, are
military veterans.
And they planned to the minute
how they’re getting in
and how they’re getting out.
“16-inch barrel.”
“No, that’s a 20-inch barrel.”
“Is it?”
“Should we be having
the cameras in here?
Whatever, fuck it.
What?”
“I’ll just sit right
here in the middle.”
“Yes.”
“O.K.”
“Does everybody have one?”
“Yep.”
“All right.”
“So I was in the Army
for about six years.
I joined when I was
17 and I was infantry.
I did become jaded in the
fact that I didn’t understand,
like why are we in Iraq.
And I saw it firsthand
how silly it was.”
“Is this what war felt like, Eli?”
“I was the driver.”
“Oh, you were the driver?”
“Actually, being in the
back of a seven-ton
is preferable to this, almost.”
“A lot of the people that I rely
on for security and logistics,
anything like that,
are former military.”
“All right.”
“Right, guys, out.”
“Left side, left side,
left side of the sidewalk.”
“Get on the sidewalk
on the left side.”
“Well, people expect that
people with our views
are going to come
out 400 pounds.
They call them white
trash or things like that.
And we’re kind of showing
that that’s not the case.
We are a group of well-mannered,
good-looking young white people
who have something to say.”
“We are here to represent
white America’s interests.
When polled, white
Americans do not agree
with what we see here —
this statue being
covered up and torn down
in front of all of these people
who are terrified to say it,
because of the evil R-word
they might be called.
No more.
Absolutely not.
This ends now.
We will be back.
We will be back.
We will be back.
We will be back.
We will be back.
Step it out.
All right, go, go, go, go,
double time, double time.
Let’s go.
Everyone, right now.
Walk it out.
If you are  in
front of the next person,
you are wrong.
Let’s move.”
“Hurry it up, 15, let’s go.”
“Let’s go.”
“Hey everyone, Charlottesville
3.0 was a great success
and it was a lot of fun.
We came, we triggered, we left.
We demonstrated that we
came in peace in May,
we came in peace in July,
we were badly mistreated.
And we came in peace tonight.
It was a great
success, and we’re —”
This event isn’t
for the few people
who happen to be at the park.
It’s for the world to witness.
Before long, the return
to Charlottesville
is trending on Twitter.
And the next day, it’s
all over the news.
“Donation basket —
Donations, donations, thank
you, thank you,
thank you, gentlemen.
Greatly appreciated.
Thank you, thank you.”
There are no reliable
numbers about the size
of the alt-right, let alone
how many veterans are involved.
That lack of
information allows them
to say whatever they
want about who they are.
“I went from Kuwait to
Baghdad back and forth,
and then we did a little
bit on the east border
over by Iran with those
 Shia ,
you know what I'm talking about, 
those Shia militia people?”
On alt-right podcasts,
Eli portrayed himself
as a callous combat veteran.
“We’d rather a Chechen shoot
at us than a  —
be next to a Haji.”
But in our interviews, he’s
vague about his time in Iraq.
Sorry, did you say
you were in Iraq?
“Yes.”
How long were you there?
“Only three — nine months.”
Oh.
Different than three.
“Well, I went there —
I went to Kuwait for a
little bit for three months,
and it wasn’t really Iraq.”
It’s the base.
“And then it was nine.
Yeah, yeah, exactly.”
Right.
“And it was towards the end part,
so the demobilization period.
Because I only graduated
high school in 2010.”
Right.
Will you just say in
a full sentence
how long you were in the Army?
"Hold on a sec.”
His accounts of
deployment didn’t add up.
And soon we’d find out why.
We contacted the Army to
get his military records.
Next on Eli’s agenda —
“University of Florida is
bracing for potential violence today
at a speech by white
nationalist leader Richard Spencer.”
He’s opening for Richard Spencer
on a so-called college tour.
“Officials at the state-run
University of Florida
initially turned down
Spencer’s request to speak,
but when he threatened a
First Amendment lawsuit,
administrators relented.”
“”
“”
“”
Claiming free speech rights,
Spencer and his group
target a public university.
The governor declares a
state of emergency
and media from across the country
comes to cover the controversy.
“Just so you know, there are
metal detectors around here,
so make sure you have nothing
on the prohibited list.
They’ll hand it to
you there next to you.”
“Our movement was once
an atomized, autonomous
and aimless individuals.
This November it will
be one year since I
made the leap into meeting
others in the alt-right.
I’ve gone on podcasts, I’ve argued
with people in debate groups,
but I’ve never given a
live political speech.
I’m not really nervous,
I’m just excited. 
And I’m also spilling
water all over Richard’s bed.”
No Nazis, no K.K.K.,
no fascist U.S.A.
No Nazis, no K.K.K.,
no fascist U.S.A.”
“Move back up little bit.
Back up so they can work.
Please back it up.
Please, everybody, back up.”
“I was denied entrance
to this event
because I have phone
numbers on my arm, which
they know is a tactic
that protesters
use in case they’re arrested.”
“Like, right now like I got
racially profiled trying
to go in, because
apparently we don't fit
the Caucasian stereotype 
of how we should look.”
“Any time, any place.
Punch a
Nazi in the face.”
“Which side of
history are you on?
Which side of
history are you on?”
“Allow me to speak.
And then we'll have 
a conversation afterwards.
What do you think about that?“
“Go home, Spencer.
Go home, Spencer.”
“Are you adults?
Are you adults?
Are you ready to
think for yourselves?
It doesn’t look like it.”
“O.K., Hi, Mr. Dick Spencer.
Thanks for coming.
I’d like to introduce myself
as Eman Elshahawy,
and my ethnicity is
Egyptian and Puerto Rican.
And I am a beautiful
brown woman here today.
And I guess my
question for you is,
how did it feel to get
punched in the face on camera?”
“It hurt.
Yeah, it hurts when someone
punches you in the face.
Is that a real question?”
“Yeah, how bad did it hurt,
like, did you  your jaw?”
“Hey, excuse me, Egyptian
Puerto Rican woman
that just asked the question.
I have an answer
for you, actually,
from the third-person
perspective.
I was in D.C. the day that
Richard got punched.
And that day changed
my life, and it
changed hundreds of people
who are white Americans’
lives that day, when
they fundamentally
realized that this country
did not belong to us
and that we were going to have
to fight for what we believed
in and fight for our people.
So you can thank
yourselves and all
of your celebrations of violence
for why we are here today,
because we are
fundamentally reacting
to what you have said and done.”
“I never really kind
of got anything
when I was Elliott Kline,
until I became Eli Mosley.
Eli Mosley was able to
find that sense of purpose
that I was always looking for.
Yeah, it was a little
obnoxious trying
to give a speech with 600
people screaming at you.”
“To struggle, friends.”
“To struggle.”
“However, the audio came in
just fine over the internet
and millions of people are
going to see what we said.”
“I gave a speech
yesterday and now Twitter
has removed my
account completely.
When you go to
tweet, you hit tweet,
‘Your account is
currently suspended.
For more information,
go to Twitter.com.’”
The social media platforms that
initially allowed the alt-right
to flourish are
starting to stifle it.
Twitter is cracking down,
sporadically, on hate speech,
banning some accounts affiliated
with white nationalism.
“I’ve been banned maybe 20
times at this point, now.
And they don’t understand.
No, you shut us down,
we come right back.
You shut us down,
we come right back.
We’re not going anywhere.
Every time I get an
account shut down,
I’m making a new
one the next day.”
Elliott Kline’s Army
documents arrive.
The story they tell is
far different from the one
he created.
Turns out, he never deployed —
not to Iraq, not anywhere.
Elliott Kline spent 
about six years
in the Pennsylvania
National Guard,
coming in to train
one weekend a month
and for some weeks
over the summers.
Two soldiers from his
unit also confirmed
that he never deployed.
The Army tells me that
you did not deploy.
“The Army tells you?”
Yeah.
So did you go to Iraq?
“I was in Kuwait.
I told you that before.”
You told me you went to Kuwait
and then you went to Iraq.
“Well, they’re — they’re — 
basically, it’s the —
it’s very similar,
the way it works.”
So what were the dates
that you were there?
“Um, let me think.
Hold on, I’m trying to find out.
Um, 2012, I believe,
but I’ve got to look.”
Because the last troops left
Iraq in the end of 2011.
The facts don’t seem
to matter to Eli.
But maybe that’s
the kind of person
who becomes a leader
in this movement.
The more that people like
him come out into the open,
the more they
reveal the alt-right
for what it really is.
“ — was
in Dixie, hooray, hooray.”
It’s a movement where 30
people with cheap tiki torches
can seem like an army in the
echo chamber of social media,
where white men claim
to be the real victims,
and where a weekend warrior
can pass himself off
as a disillusioned
veteran of war.
