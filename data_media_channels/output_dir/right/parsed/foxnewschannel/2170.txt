HEATHER: HALF PAST THE TOP OF
THE HOUR.
OVERNIGHT THE US TRADE TEAM
ARRIVING FOR TRADE TALKS, DONALD
TRUMP HAS NOT HELD BACK IN HIS
CRITICISM OF TRADE PRACTICES
CALLING FOR A BETTER DEAL FOR
THE US.
WHAT KIND OF DEAL CAN WE EXPECT?
THE BUSINESS AND FINANCE CHAIR
AT KINGS COLLEGE IN NEW YORK
CITY BRIAN BRANDENBURG.
A BIG DAY, THEY ARRIVED IN
CHINA.
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO
IS THERE AND WHAT ROLE PEOPLE
PLAY.
BRING IT UP ON SCREEN.
>> THE US HAS SEVERAL PEOPLE
THERE.
YOU HAVE THE TRADE HARDLINERS
WHO HAVE ADVOCATED TARIFFS
AGAINST CHINA TO GET THEM AT THE
NEGOTIATION TABLE, WILBUR ROSS
IN THE SAME BOAT.
ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE STEVE
MNUCHIN AND LARRY KUDLOW.
YOU HAVE TWO PARTIES AT THE
TABLE REALLY.
IT IS A BIG CONTINGENTS WITH TWO
PARTIES, ONE THE MORE FREE-TRADE
SIDE, ONE THE MORE TRADE
HARDLINER SIDE AND SOME PEOPLE
CRITICIZED AND SAID THIS TRADE
PARTY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT ONCE
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO SIDE OF THE
STORY RE-PRESENTED BUT THAT IS
PROBABLY THE POINT, TO GET THE
CHINESE TO THE TABLE AND DO
NEGOTIATION, HAVE PEOPLE
REPRESENTING DIFFERENT ASPECTS
TO BRING DIFFERENT THINGS TO THE
TABLE AS THEY TALK WITH THE
CHINESE.
HEATHER: WHAT ARE THE TOP ISSUES
FOR THE DELEGATION?
>> THE US ONCE CHINA TO BUY MORE
US GOODS.
TAKE DOWN THE TRADE DEFICIT AND
THEY WANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
PROTECTION.
THEY WANT CHINA TO STOP FORCING
COMPANIES TO HAND OVER
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TRADE
SECRETS.
THE US REALLY WANTS CHINA TO
BACK OFF OF ITS MADE
TECHNOLOGY, BECOME WORLD LEADERS
IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE GOVERNMENT
WILL SUBSIDIZE COMPANIES TO DO
THAT.
IT IS UNFAIR TO SUBSIDIZE THAT.
AND GO WITH IT.
>> AND FORCING TECHNOLOGY
TRANSFERS.
AND US COMPANIES DO BUSINESS IN
CHINA.
AND YOU NEED TO PARTNER WITH OUR
COMPANIES AND HAND OVER YOUR
TECHNOLOGY TO COMPANIES AND
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS THE
BACKBONE OF THE ECONOMY AND
TRADE REPRESENTATIVES SAY THAT
NEEDS TO STOP.
HEATHER: OUR GREAT FINANCIAL
TEAM, THE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD ON
TRADE, LOOK FORWARD TO BEING
WITH PRES. XI JINPING.
AND IS NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE,
WE ALWAYS HAD A GOOD, GREAT
RELATIONSHIP.
IN TERMS OF WHAT WILL BE
ACCOMPLISHED AND WHAT COULD BE
DONE.
>> YOU WILL SEE THE CHINESE MAKE
A COMMITMENT TO BUY MORE TO
BRING DOWN THE TRADE DEFICIT AND
YOU WILL SEE THE PROMISE TO
INSERT OR -- PROTECT
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM THE
US SIDE.
AND A CREDIBLE THING, THE
CHINESE LIKE TO MAKE BIG
PROMISES AND NOT DELIVER SO THE
POINT OF OUR TRADE DELEGATION
AND WE NEED TO DELIVER THOSE KEY
I THINK THEY CAN MAKE SOME
PROGRESS.
AND AND THE RIGHT PEOPLE ON BOTH
SIDES.
AND THE TRADE DEFICIT AND
HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME AWAY WITH
A LITTLE DENT IN THAT.
AND WE DO A BETTER JOB
PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AND TAKING TRADE BARRIERS DOWN.
THAT IS THE OUTCOME.
THE INPUT IS BETTER PROTECTION
FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND
TAKING DOWN TARIFFS AND BARRIERS
