IT IS LOOKING INCREASINGLY LIKELY WITH ALL THE NEWS COMING OUT THAT THE ROBERT MUELLER INVESTIGATORY TEAM MIGHT ACTUALLY WANT A SITDOWN, FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT. THEY COULD INTERVIEW HIM SOON. YOU MIGHT BE COMFORTABLE WITH IT. I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT SHOULD HE? NO. THAT IS UNEARNED CONFIDENCE THAT TRUMP IS SO WELL KNOWN FOR. HE DOESN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH HE GETS HIMSELF INTO TROUBLE BY HIS TWEETS, HIS MOUTH. THE FACT THAT HE THINKS THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME. I TWEETED LAST NIGHT THAT IF HE HAS TWO BRAIN CELLS HE WILL NEVER ALLOW HIMSELF TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BEFORE MUELLER OR THE TEAM. BUT THAT WOULD REQUIRE SELF-AWARENESS AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW YOU ARE AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF IT WORKING WELL FOR YOU. HE IS NOT BIG ON SELF-AWARENESS. HE OPENLY SAID DURING AN INTERVIEW THAT HE FIRED JAMES COMEY BECAUSE OF THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT THE THINGS HE SAYS GET HIM IN TROUBLE. OBVIOUSLY WE ARE NOT IN THE PRESIDENT'S SIDE. WHAT DO CONSERVATIVES THINK? LET'S TURN TO JUDGE NAPOLITANO TALKING ABOUT WHAT TRUMPS STRATEGY SHOULD BE. WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO SUBMIT TO AN INTERVIEW ABOUT MUELLER AND FBI AGENTS, MY ARGUMENT IS NEVER SHOULD HE DO THAT. WHY? BECAUSE HE CANNOT KNOW WHAT MUELLER AND HIS TEAM KNOW ABOUT THE CASE. HE CANNOT KNOW WHAT EVIDENCE THEY HAVE. ONE LIE OR ONE CLOSE TO A LIE ABOUT A MATERIAL MATTER AND HE WAS FACING A POTENTIAL INDICTMENT. NO SITTING PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN INDICTED FOR A CRIME. BUT IF THE FEDS WANT TO TRAP YOU THEY ARE VERY GOOD AT DOING IT. DONALD TRUMP IS A VERY HEADSTRONG PERSON WHO PROBABLY BELIEVES HE IS SMARTER THAN HIS INTERROGATORS AND HE MAY BE, BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW MORE ABOUT THE CASE THAN THEY DO. IT IS A TRAP AND THEY SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM IT. I THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME PEOPLE, MAYBE A FEW HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS. KENNEDY WOULD SAY HE SHOULD GO TALK BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH IN MY DEAR LEADER DOUBLE ALMOST EVERYONE ELSE KNOW THAT THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO CAN SIT IN THAT SORT OF ENVIRONMENT WHO ARE THERE TO SHRED THE FLESH FROM YOUR BONES, IT WILL NOT BE DONALD TRUMP OBVIOUSLY. HIS LAWYERS DON'T WANT IT WHICH IS WHY THEY HAVE COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVE IDEAS. HERE ARE SOME OPTIONS. THAT SHOULD END THE DISCUSSION. WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT AT THAT POINT. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE THINKING, THEY ARE GOING TO RIDICULOUS LENGTHS TO GET HIM OUT OF THE SITDOWN. IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT'S LEGAL TEAM THAT IS WHAT THEY SHOULD DO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS. THAT IS HOW THEY SHOULD DEFEND HIM AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THEY SHOULD BE OFFERING BUT THERE IS NO WAY THE INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR AND COUNCIL SHOULD ACCEPT THAT ALSO. THAT IS WHAT I WANTED TO ASK BECAUSE I'M NOT A LAWYER. I AM UNAWARE OF HOW IT WOULD WORK IF THEY DO TRY TO DODGE TRUMP TESTIFYING. IS HE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THAT? IF HE IS THE ONE UNDER INVESTIGATION 単 AND ANY OTHER CONTACTS THE PERSON UNDER INVESTIGATION IS NOT GOING TO SAY I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A WRITTEN STATEMENT. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF SUBPOENA POWER. FIRST WHY DOES IT MATTER? YOU EITHER HAVE THEM IN OR YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS AND HAVE THEM DO A WRITTEN RESPONSE. CHUCK ROSENBERG SAID THIS. I DON'T THINK ANYONE NECESSARILY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE SAYS NO YOU HAVE TO COME IN HERE. BUT THERE ARE SOME PRIOR SUPREME COURT STATEMENTS LIKE THIS THAT MIGHT GIVE US AN IDEA. IT IS SO TELLING, WHENEVER YOU TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND ALL HIS TROUBLES, LET'S GO BACK TO NIXON. NOT JUST NIXON, WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT ON BILL CLINTON. BUT POSSIBLY WITH SIMILAR CHARGES COMING OUT. THE SUPREME COURT IN REFERENCE TO BILL CLINTON SAID THIS. I AM SURE THEY WOULD MAKE THE CASE THAT APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE IN PERSON WITH FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS. WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE BECAUSE THEY SAID A FEW WEEKS POTENTIALLY BUT THEY ALSO SAID IT WOULD BE A LIMITED SET OF QUESTIONS. HE COULD BE THAT IS NOT THE ONLY TIME THEY TALK TO HIM. THEY MAY HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT THEY HAVE ALREADY FOUND OUT. COULD BE QUESTIONS ABOUT RUSSIA OR MONEY LAUNDERING AS STEVE BANNON HAS PREDICTED. WHAT I REALLY RESPECT ABOUT THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS HOW THERE HAVEN'T BEEN WEEKS. AND MUELLER HAS ACCIDENTALLY SAID SOMETHING. IS NOT COMING FROM MUELLER DIRECTLY. I KNOW POLITICALLY THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS WITH BULLER AND MYSELF. I LIKE THE WAY HE IS CARRYING OUT THIS INVESTIGATION BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IN ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WOULD BE ATTENTIVE LEAKS AND INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE GETTING OUT THERE. I WANT THIS INVESTIGATION TO BE FAIR AND THE ONLY WAY FOR IT TO HAPPEN IS FOR LEAKS NOT TO OCCUR. THE AUDIENCE AT FOX NEWS SEES JUDGE NAPOLITANO SAYING IT IS A TRAP 単 SO HE GAVE HIS LEGAL ADVICE TO TRUMP DIRECTLY. SO NOW THAT GOES DOWN SHUT THE NEXT RESPONSE BE WHO WAS WATCHING? OF COURSE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING OR HE WOULDN'T TELL HIS CLIENT NOT TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET CAUGHT UP IN SOME. I REMEMBER BACK IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME OF THESE QUOTES 単 IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE WHAT ARE YOU RUNNING FROM? IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE, OR LIE ABOUT, WHY ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT GOING INTO AN INTERVIEW WITH MUELLER AND LYING? THAT IS WHAT HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WHEN HE SAID ALIVE OR ANYTHING APPROACHING A LIE COULD BE 単 REMEMBER THE RIGHT WING, THOSE WHO ARE SUPPORTIVE OF TRUMP PAINT THIS INVESTIGATION AS A POLITICAL MOVE BY THE LEFT AND THEY ARE NOW CONSTANTLY QUESTIONING THE INTEGRITY OF MUELLER WHICH IS HILARIOUS BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING THEY LOVE THE FACT THAT MUELLER WAS APPOINTED TO A SPECIAL COUNSEL. IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY ARE DOING THIS. IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME THAT HE IS TRYING TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE MUELLER IS JUST THERE TO TRAP YOU. AND TRY TO MISLEAD YOU. IT'S NONSENSE.
