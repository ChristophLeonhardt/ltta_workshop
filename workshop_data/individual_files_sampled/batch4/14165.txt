for the rebel dot media I'm Ezra levan it's been a manic day I flew in early this morning fought crazy London rush-hour traffic got into the center of the city came to the Old Bailey and I couldn't believe my eyes at least 1500 Tommy Robinson fans in the street chanting signs flags it was very exciting a very strong police presence too a police helicopter overhead lots of police vehicles and tons of street cops there was also a small cadre of professional left-wing protesters I think there was 16 I'll have to look at the photos again but it was a very positive feeling when when the bad guys are outnumbered 100 to 1 there's no chance of anything going sideways and it was a completely peaceful event I'm glad that I had reached out to the court security in advance to find out how to get into the courtroom because they were extremely strict in fact if people weren't on either the media list or Tommy zone party list I don't think any members of the public were let in which I know is disappointing to some people I met one lady who told me she flew in all the way from Hong Kong can you believe it I met another lady who drove in several hundred miles from here in the UK at other Tommy trials I've had people introduce themselves to me from Canada the United States other places in Europe so I think that was disappointing I can understand that it's a very high-security Court it's where terrorism and violent offences happen but it puzzles me that not a single person was allowed and other than those on the list but I'm glad I was on the list the first thing I did in the courtroom was I asked the clerk if I could live tweet the court now I was told I couldn't but I said to the clerk please ask the judge because it's very important we have maximum transparency because of the widespread interest in the case and to my surprise the clerk did put that to the judge and the judge did permit live-tweeting so I was ready to go I found a plug I was sat down with my laptop but the whole thing was over in less than 20 minutes although tommy was ready to have the substantive of hearing for contempt of court he never got to it he was there with his three lawyers but and the Attorney General had a lawyer there but the whole matter was put over to October 23rd another month and I mean I'm not complaining it was a long flight here and go home seven hours each way for 20 minutes in court that's a little bit crazy but actually what happened in court has made less of an impression on me than the amazing support on the street I don't know if you can even hear it there's still now hours later hundreds of people singing Tommy Robinson chants there was a moment after court where Tommy and his lawyers were debriefing in the cafeteria in the court and I went up there and I just got a bottle of water and let the lawyers have their chance to talk to Tommy privately so I just went to the window to look down at the crowd and when I pulled back the blinds the crowd saw me and maybe they recognized me or maybe they saw that it was someone with Tommy's sound harsh and the chant came up Oh Tommy Tommy and I was just up there and to look down I felt a you know one degree of separation the deep love that Tommy has amongst the British people and when he was done conferring with his lawyers I said Tommy come to the window and just look down and I had my iphone camera out and I just showed Tommy looking down and they could see him because it was only a couple of stories up that was a very interesting moment for me it showed the deep connection that Tommy has eyerly ER compared Tommy's reception to that of a rock star but that's not accurate because rock stars come and go the affection towards rock stars is usually shallow and ephemeral and fashionable it's light hearted it's it's of the moment but I believe that the people who are here for Tommy are deeply committed deeply informed about the matter and have a level of engagement that no rock star has and it's very interesting and Tommy I think really respects and appreciates that because for one thing it's the public that has crowdfunded his legal fees and that's the save Tommy dot-com crowdfund we have another smaller crowd fund just to fly me back and forth here to cover these things then I guess I'm coming back on October 23rd for that as well I guess I'm giving you some of my summary thoughts here I might have another video to make but again it was a very short hearing today less than 20 minutes case management that's another way of saying scheduling and who says what and and does what the fact that this is happening in the Old Bailey criminal courts is very unusual it would be like having your traffic ticket fought in the Supreme Court of Canada the Supreme Court of the United States that's just on normal but nothing about this cases being normal has it as Tommy would say it's a stitch-up one last thing because I I come in from Canada and I don't mind because Tommy's an old friend he's a former employee and we've taken on the role of a crowdfunding which is one of the things we do with the rebel so I understand my role and I you know I enjoy it I don't mind the flight but I've always thought why is it that a reporter has to come seven hours each way to report on this there were other journalists in the courtroom today but they were all hostile they were uniformly hostile the time and they were with the mainstream media I don't trust their reportage if they were reporting from the last two events was any guide but my point is where are the other conservative advocacy journalists where are the members of parliament I can't name a single British MP who is stood by Tommy you don't have to stand by Tommy I understand that they might not want to be associated with the founder of the EDL but why are they not even saying look I may have differences with Tommy and his history but his treatment is wrong why why can't a single MP out of the hundreds muster that there's this Lord Pearson of ranek but he's the houses in the House of Lords and there's the member of the European Parliament Gerrard baton of the UK but where's the conservative establishment you came even Breitbart UK which I love it's really one of my favourite media outlets and we interview folks all the time from there including Alan Bukhari who's just outstanding how come they're not here in court I'm not picking on him I'm just wondering why you watch Breitbart not here why's why is other than Gavin McInnes who I sort of nudged to come out here why is no American here is this not inter I think it's huge I just don't understand it I could speculate political correctness of this fear of being called racist that maybe they don't understand or know Tommy well enough and they are worried that the slanders against them might be true I don't know but I find that actually one of the most concerning things don't get me wrong I I'm not gonna say I like coming here I don't like the fact that he's still in court but I feel like I can I feel like I'm a good fit for this project so I'm not I'm not resentful that I'm was this like my third or fourth flight back if I'm not that's not bothering me what bothers me is that there's not folks who are seven minutes away coming like I'm schlepping in seven hours from Toronto I'm not complaining where are the Brits where are the Europeans where are the civil libertarians where's Reporters Without Borders where's Amnesty International I just that boggles my mind and it worries me a bit about the lack of any establishment belief in core values of Liberty and as a Canadian who inherited those values of Liberty from the United Kingdom over the centuries as someone who studied law that was rooted in British law whose concepts of Liberty and and limited government are from the Magna Carta I makes me sad that the mother country is maybe losing some of the freedoms that inspired the Commonwealth I'll wrap up on that note if I have more thoughts I'll put them on Tommy Trial calm I did fly in I'm going home tomorrow I thought I'd be here all day for the substantive trial I will come back on October 23rd hopefully it'll be done then but knowing the state and their enmity towards Tommy let's be honest this isn't gonna be over on October 23rd either for the rebel media I'm as real Avance I'm here in the UK for Tommy's second contempt of court trial to see all my videos on the subject go to Tommy Trial calm you
