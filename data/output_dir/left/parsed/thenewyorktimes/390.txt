A draft report by scientists
from 13 federal agencies
obtained by The New York Times
directly contradicts claims
by the Trump administration
that human contribution to
climate change is uncertain
and that the ability to
predict the effects is limited.
"People have called me a climate
skeptic or a climate denier.
I don't even know what it
means to deny the climate.
I would say that there
are climate exaggerators."
Scott Pruitt, administrator of
the Environmental Protection
Agency, one of the 13 agencies
that must approve the document,
has frequently questioned
the extent of human impact
on climate change.
"The climate is changing, and
human activity contributes
to that change in some measure.
The real issue is, how
much we contribute to that
and measuring that
with precision."
The report states,
"Many lines of evidence
demonstrate that human
activity, especially
emissions of greenhouse
gas, heat-trapping gases,
are primarily responsible
for recent observed
climate change."
"Global warming is occurring,
that human activity contributes
to it in some manner.
But it still begs the question,
‘What do we do about it?’
Does it pose an existential
threat, as some say?"
The authors of the
draft report write,
"It is very likely that the
accelerated rate of Arctic
warming will have a significant
consequence for the United
States."
"Measuring with precision
human activity on the climate
is something very
challenging to do.
And there's tremendous
disagreement
about the degree of impact."
According to the report,
"it is extremely likely
that more than half of the
global mean temperature
increase since 1951 was caused
by human influence on climate."
Scientists are calling
this a test case.
This is the first major
federal climate science
report to come out in
the Trump administration.
And how the administration
reacts to it
could set the tone on climate
change for years to come.
