TO MAKE EVERYTHING THEY CAN

38
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:06,153

39
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:08,522
LOOK, MS-13 IS THE MOST VIOLENT

40
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:09,289
GANG IN THE WORLD.

41
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:10,657

42
00:01:10,657 --> 00:01:12,593
BE INITIATED INTO THE GROUP.

ENFORCING THEIR BORDER.

117
00:03:12,547 --> 00:03:14,348
THERE WERE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM

HAMAS WHO HAD BOLT-CUTTERS AND

119
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,186
WIRE CUTTERS.

00:03:58,326 --> 00:04:00,762
ISRAEL DOES WHAT ISRAEL NEEDS TO

146
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:01,029
DO.

147
00:04:01,029 --> 00:04:02,097
