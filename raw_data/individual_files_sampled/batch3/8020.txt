PRESIDENT TRUMP'S X LAWYER, MICHAEL COHEN CLAIMING HE KNEW ABOUT THE MEETING AT THE TRUMP TOWER WITH RUSSIANS IN 2016. HE SAID AFTER BEING TOLD ABOUT A POSSIBLE MEETING, CANADA HERE IS GERALDO RIVERA. IS THIS A BIG DEAL? I THINK IT IS A BIG DEAL. I THINK MICHAEL COHEN REPRESENTS BRIAN, HE REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT LEGAL THREAT TO THE PRESIDENT. WE ALL HAVE ONE KEY PERSON WE TELL ALL OF OUR LIFE STORY TO AN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CASE HE TRUSTED MICHAEL COHEN, HE WAS HIS FIXER FOR MANY YEARS AND NOW I THINK HE HAS BEEN CUT FROM THE TRUMP TEAM AND HE'S FEELING RECKLESS AND HE'S EVEN ABLE TO DO DOWN AND DIRTY THINGS LIKE RELEASE THAT TAPE THE CLIENT AND THEM FOR THINK VERY, VERY SIGNIFICANT. IF THEY'RE WILLING TO DO THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING. IN TERMS OF THE MEETING, VERY SPECIFICALLY. THE ONE WHO HAS HAD THE MOST LEGAL PERIL IS DON JUNIOR, REMEMBER HE TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS, IF HE TESTIFIED CONGRESS UNDER OATH THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT KNOW OF THE MEETING AND HE HAS A TAPE THAT SAYS HE DID KNOW THE MEETING AND DONE JUNIOR HAS LIED. WHO HAS MORE CREDIBILITY. I THINK WHO HAS MORE CREDIBILITY. I THINK MICHAEL COHEN ALSO WENT IN FRONT OF CONGRESS AND SWORN OATH AND I'M SURE HE DIDN'T SAY THAT DON SENIOR KNEW ABOUT DON JUNIOR'S MEETING. SON DON JUNIOR. SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE IS TRY TO MAKE UP STORIES TO GET HIMSELF OUT OF AN UNRELATED JAM, TAXICABS MAY BE, EVEN PAIN BILL AND HILLARY'S CRICKET THERE'S A THEORY OUT THERE HELP TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. THERE'S A THEORY OUT THERE THAT RUDY GIULIANI IS TRYING TO DIMINISH THE HAND OF MICHAEL COHEN AND IT WAS THE TRUMP TEAM THAT RELEASED THE INFORMATION. DAVIS IS ON INFORMATION THING WE DIDN'T DO IT. WHAT YOU THINK. WHEN WE GO THROUGH IT AGAIN. TO TAKE, TO TAKE THAT TAPE WAS UNETHICAL AND TO LEAK IT IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE AND IT'S CERTAINLY A DESIRABLE EVENT FOR MICHAEL COHEN THE ATTORNEY. I REALLY DO BELIEVE THE RECKLESSLY BROAD SCOPE OF THE PROBE, YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT COULD HAPPEN. FOR EXAMPLE, IF PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW OF THE MEETING IN TRUMP TOWER, IF HE DID, LET'S SAY HE KNEW OF THE MEETING AND APPROVED OF THE MEETING AND THEN GOT SOME INFORMATION OR SOMETHING ELSE THE VALUE FROM THE MEETING THAT HE USED AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON, THAT COULD BE COLLUSION. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ILLEGAL, IT COULD BE CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION BUT IN THE BROADNESS OF THE SCOPE OF POSSIBILITIES, MICHAEL COHEN DOES REPRESENT, FOR ALL HIS SLEAZINESS, A THREAT TO THE PRESIDENT. YOU ALSO KNOW THEY ARE INTERVIEWING THE CFO OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION IN THIS GRAND JURY ON MICHAEL COHEN WHICH GOT HUNTED BY ROBERT
