1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,009
My name is Guillermo
del Toro, and I’m

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,670
the director,
producer, co-writer

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,730
of “The Shape of Water."

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,820
This is an important
scene because it’s

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,420
a scene that sets the
communication between Elisa

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,800
and the creature.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,600
It was important in the
story because the way

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,020
I introduce the creature
in the screenplay

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,230
first is with a shock, very
much like a monster movie,

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,510
with a hand against the glass.

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,580
Then, I introduce
the fact that he

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,840
ate two of the fingers of the
villain in the piece, you know,

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,280
the antagonist.

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,710
And then I introduce him on
a scene previous to this,

15
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,240
and I keep it on an edge.

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,810
You know, I show you an
innocent and a beauty

17
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,150
through the way his
eyes move and look.

18
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,670
But it’s still a
dangerous creature, maybe.

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,640
Maybe not.

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,210
But there is definitely
a contact between them.

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,630
I also show you
that he’s bleeding,

22
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,690
that he has been tortured, so
you know the reaction maybe

23
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,980
was justified.

24
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,190
So in this sequence, I do it —

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,069
I knew it was a
prologue to a montage,

26
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,370
so I wanted to keep it very
much stylistically in one piece.

27
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,290
So I do three —

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,790
three shots, two of them very
elaborate with a small crane.

29
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,080
And I show you the placing
of the egg, the — the placing

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,950
of the record.

31
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,870
Everything is a single shot.

32
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,870
Until we go out to
a wide shot of Eliza,

33
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,250
and it’s a very
quaint composition.

34
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,680
It’s a — it’s very, very
sort of meek, you know?

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,000
She’s sitting by the pool
eating her little sandwich.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,952
It’s sort of a beautiful
picnic of — of —

37
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:44,310
of really intense
oddity, you know?

38
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,290
And — and — and that’s
what the movie is.

39
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,230
The movie is the
marriage of the ordinary

40
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,480
and the extraordinary, which
is a very Mexican vocation,

41
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,670
because it’s the
story of a woman that

42
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,950
falls in love with a river god.

43
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,150
And where does she keep him?

44
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,296
In her bathtub.

45
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:04,980
So in this montage,
I’m going to show you

46
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,970
symbolic little things that
remind you of her routine

47
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,470
alone.

48
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,960
The — the boiled eggs, which
she used to share alone,

49
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,690
and that have a very
sexual connotation

50
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,670
of activities alone.

51
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,340
The bathtub, she’s
looking at the bathtub,

52
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,030
making plans, perhaps, for
her future with the creature,

53
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,900
you know?

54
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,420
All this is going on with her.

55
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,430
And at the same time,
her love of musicals,

56
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,690
which has been set up in
the movie several times.

57
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,320
I wanted to show her dancing
with the mop like Fred Astaire,

58
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,090
you know, sort of a very
classical musical routine solo,

59
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,910
and the connection between
them through the glass.

60
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,370
They are still not together.

61
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,320
There’s a glass separating them.

62
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,560
And they both — both move
beautifully together,

63
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,790
but they are not
together yet, so there’s

64
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,460
a longing to the scene
that I find very moving.

65
00:02:56,460 --> 00:00:00,000
