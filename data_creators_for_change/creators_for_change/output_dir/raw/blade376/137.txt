00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,290

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,250
other day I went to Asda which is the

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then again I suppose taking the piss</font>

12

13
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,710

worked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven months at ski resort in</font>

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,170
France in which I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hotel host I had</font>

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,239
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clean rooms anything from sick in a</font>

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,160
toilet without gloves which would have

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,260

20
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,980

21
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,600
honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and will stay with me for the</font>

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,340
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life but that's a story we</font>

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,989
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep for another time if of course</font>

and it was at this job in France<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

26
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,030
gained a battle scar I mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear all</font>

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,710
the time about people with battle scars

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,409
where they in fact inflicted a really

29
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,240
tedious injury and then gloss it over

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,310
with a really epic story to make it

31
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,700
sound like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was truly justified when</font>

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,110
actually the justification was then

33
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,369
being an idiot or unlucky in my case as

34
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,350
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I'm not gonna say how I was</font>

35
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,390
wrestling with a shark or doing

36
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,180
press-ups over a bear trap or even being

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,979
the bodyguard for<font color="#CCCCCC"> daniel radcliffe at</font>

38
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,630
the latest harry potter movie premiere

39
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how it is and</font>

40
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a cheap laugh and we can</font>

41
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,140
all just<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave this video with a little</font>

42
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">smug look of yeah miles was pretty</font>

43
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,470
stupid yeah brilliant this is on my arm

44
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,020
but then if you can see it it comes up

45
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,310
more when I'm 10 /<font color="#E5E5E5"> um yeah it goes all</font>

46
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,380
the way down there and it fades around

47
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,509
the corner so one random night I wake up

48
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,969
in complete darkness because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

49
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,079
it's like in the middle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the night</font>

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,469
dark and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I prick in my arm as</font>

51
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,200
in a sting not<font color="#E5E5E5"> up yeah</font>

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,270
so being half asleep I didn't really

53
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">think anything of it and so I rolled</font>

54
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">over and as I rolled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over I felt a huge</font>

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,720
rip go up my arm turn on the light and

56
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,110
there was my arm covered in blood so

57
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,300
what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me any guesses night</font>

58
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,980
not wrestling with sharks in a dream not

59
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,800
dreaming of a bear trap or Daniel

60
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,750
Radcliffe what happened was one of the

61
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">bedsprings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had come through the mattress</font>

62
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,560
and therefore dug into my arm<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

63
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,970
only when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I rolled over that the bed</font>

64
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,629
spring<font color="#CCCCCC"> when and ripped that skull which</font>

65
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,700

good care of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me they said it wasn't</font>

68
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,290
worthy of being put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the accident book</font>

69
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,170
and they gave me reassurance by telling

me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to flip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the mattress and</font>
