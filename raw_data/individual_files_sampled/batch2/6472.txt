Donald Trump his response to this I think it's fair to say and you'll see the video that it's kind of changed a little bit since yesterday initially coming out of the Cavanaugh testimony he he didn't even make any reference to Cruz's kristinb lousy Ford he just said that what Cavanaugh said was strong he put out like a single tweet which is odd for Donald Trump that he was very restrained in terms of talking about this and then today comes and we have a video Donald Trump is I believe out of the country I think he's in Chile possibly in any event he's asked about this and take a look at this video it's a little bit long but he has multiple opportunities to do what he always does in communication and you'll see that he passes up basically all of them I'm just hearing a little bit about it because I've been with the president of Chile and we're talking about some very important subjects but I'm sure it will all be very good I guess the vote was a positive vote but this seems to be a delay I thought her testimony was very compelling and she looks like a very fine woman to me verifying a woman and I thought that Brett's testimony likewise was really something that I haven't seen before it was incredible it was an incredible moment I think in the history of our country but certainly she was a very credible witness she was very good in many respects and I think that I I don't know if this is gonna continue one word or are we gonna get a vote have you thought at all about a replacement Jenica not even a little bit not even a little I have no message they have to do what they think is right it is no message whatsoever they have to do what they think is right they have to be comfortable with themselves and I'm sure that's what they are I'm going to rely on all of the people including senator Grassley who is doing a very good job that'll be a decision that they're going to make and they suspect they'll be making some decision soon whether to take a vote or to do whatever else they want to do I will be totally reliant on what senator Grassley and the group decides to do there's a lot there now he did say that he hasn't been thinking of any replacement that's what you'd expect Trump to say but aside from that he says he doesn't know if they'll even end up having a vote he's just gonna defer to Grassley he has no advice for him on Colin's of Murkowski no they just have to do you know what they want to do he said very positive things about Christine Blasi Ford his defense of Cavanaugh was both hyperbolic in saying it's something we've never seen before but he didn't say he convinced the nation that he didn't do this thing or anything like that this seems like a very careful statement from a man who is almost never careful well I mean I feel like they inject him with a tranquilizer and it lasts for a little while and once it wears off believe me we're all know about it it'll probably be on later tonight usually Friday nights he goes on crazy tirades or Saturday morning but obviously I'm joking about the tranquilizer kind of but the one other thing I want to add is like the way he's commenting about the testimony from both Cavanaugh and dr. Blasi Ford it's like he's thinking they're auditioning for one of his crappy reality show thinking that he's totally got like apprentice producer head on be like it was incredible it was great TV I've never seen anything like it before he cried I mean when do you see that like he did say that she seemed very credible though yeah and look that she's been sat like I don't know if you guys watched any Fox News last night they'd Juanita Broderick on and it was just designed to shred her right wing media was like they came out of a Kavanagh testimony like tasting blood they were ready to pounce on this thing and he talks with Sean Hannity most nights him being super careful is either three-dimensional chess which seems even less likely than him being careful informed in in his communication or maybe they're getting some like some internal polling maybe there was a focus group on the testimony maybe they're actually worried about this thing yeah Lori spoken with Collins in Murkowski and he thinks that they're questioning the actual vote yeah so first quick clarification obviously he's in the u.s. he's in the White House he happened to be talking to the leader of Chile now on to the south of it I I think that his aides must have done a great job of convincing him that if he talks against dr. waz he Ford at all that it will cost them votes and he will lose power in the next two years and they must have had overwhelming proof to get him to calm down and not attack her which is his want right and then the second part of it might be that his aides convinced them he really might not survive like he not just losing collar Murkowski to what we already know but you're ordering an FBI investigation there's some chance he did it so don't get too far out there telling everybody how awesome he is and how terrible she is because in a week we might find out that that it's the opposite now remember McConnell the anime at this point like almost a week ago is a great point McConnell warned him don't pick Cavanaugh and and he said oh it's because he has too many documents okay too many calendars might be it so there might have been another warning to trump hey listen I'm not gonna head remember when we told you not to pick him okay this is why so be cool otherwise you're gonna embarrass yourself was the only person Donald Trump ever cares about himself so but but you know what at the end of the day I'll take it better for restraint and not restrained great by the Roy Moore thing too and then the guy that was on his say this is now like three or four strikes in that you're endorsing a guy who turned out to be an absolute piece of garbage so like pull your punches thank you for bringing up Roy Moore it's actually very important to the conversation because the day prior to the hearing taking place Trump went on this crazy unhinged hour and a half long press conference rant and during that rant he addressed Roy mourned you know what he said he's like I was I was at a fan of Roy Moore you know I was it but yeah so I think you might be right I think she realized ah this kind of hurt us maybe this wasn't a good way to go about it he said he was more he was a fan of Luther strange unbelievable yeah we all saw you dude we go saw you with our own eyes he's unreal thanks for watching this free clip of The Young Turks don't forget to become a TYT member today for more exclusive content join now at TYT dot-com / join
