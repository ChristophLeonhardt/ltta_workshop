SOME MAY PLAN TO SNEAK

13
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:25,311

00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:26,145
OTHERS PROTECT THEMSELVES AT

WILL IT WORK?

19
00:00:29,848 --> 00:00:31,150
HOW DOES THAT WORK.

20
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,818
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ICE AND

THANKS FOR COMING ON.

00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:40,859
>> Tucker: WE KNOW THIS

25
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:41,460
GROUP HAS BEEN COMING.

26
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,695
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING ON

27
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:43,629
VIDEO FOR WEEKS NOW.

28
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:45,331
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE, LEGAL

29
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:49,802
TO SAY YOU ARE NOT

30
00:00:49,802 --> 00:00:50,169
RESIDENTS.

31
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:51,270
HAVE YOU NO LEGAL RIGHT TO

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,603
COME IN.

33
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:52,604
NO YOU CAN'T CROSS THE

00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:52,938
BORDER.

35
00:00:52,938 --> 00:00:54,206
>> COUPLE THINGS TO DO.

36
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:56,008
IF THEY ARE REALLY SEEKING

37
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:57,443
ASYLUM, THEY JUST PASSED

38
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:59,178
THROUGH A SAFE NATION OF

39
00:00:59,178 --> 00:00:59,511
MEXICO.

40
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:04,316
IF IT'S A MATTER OF LEAVING

41
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:05,217
GUATEMALA HONDURAS.

42
00:01:05,217 --> 00:01:07,252
WENT THROUGH MEXICO THEY CAN

43
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:08,387
CLAIM ASYLUM THERE.

44
00:01:08,387 --> 00:01:09,621
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS AS

45
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:11,123
MUCH CLAIM ASYLUM OR GETTING

46
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:12,458
TO THE UNITED STATES.

47
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,325
>> Tucker: CLEARLY A SCAM,

48
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:13,692
OBVIOUSLY.

49
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:15,094
WE KNOW THAT BUT WHAT CAN WE

50
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:15,728
DO ABOUT IT?

51
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:17,296
>> CONGRESS NEEDS TO TAKE

52
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:17,896
SOME ACTION.

53
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:20,199
WE SENT A LIST OF

54
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:21,166
LEGISLATIVE FIX LOOPHOLES

55
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,401
THEY NEED TO ADDRESS.

56
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:24,103
FOR INSTANCE, THE TREASURE

57
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:25,871
HOLDS ON CLAIMING FEAR ARE

58
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:27,039
SO LOW.

59
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,507
NEARLY 90% OF PEOPLE CLAIM

60
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:31,977
FEAR WILL GET A YES FROM CIS

61
00:01:31,977 --> 00:01:33,112
BECAUSE THE THRESHOLDS ARE

62
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:33,912
SO LOW.

63
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:35,514
THEN THEY GO SEE A JUDGE IF

64
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:36,815
THEY EVER SHOW UP TO SEE A

65
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:37,149
JUDGE.

66
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:39,485
THOSE APPROVALS ARE MUCH

67
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:40,586
LOWER LIKE 30%.

68
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,187
WE NEED TO FIX THAT AND MOVE

69
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:43,856
THOSE HEARINGS UP IN FRONT

70
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:45,324
OF IMMIGRATION JUDGE SO THEY

71
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:46,759
HAVE THAT FORMAL HEARING.

72
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,560
MOST OF THEM DO NOT GET FEAR

73
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,462
FINDING BECAUSE THEY DON'T

74
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:51,630
HAVE A CREDIBLE CASE TO

75
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:51,964
PRESENT.

76
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:53,832
THEY NEED TO BE QUICKLY

77
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:54,233
REMOVED.

78
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:55,033
>> Tucker: HOW DOES IT WORK?

79
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,702
ANYBODY CAN SHOW UP AT THE

80
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:57,903
BORDER WITHOUT PAPERS AND

81
00:01:57,903 --> 00:01:59,571
SAY "I'M IN HERE FOR MY LIFE

82
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,039
OR I'M AFRAID IN SOME WAY

83
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,207
AND THEN THEY ARE LET INTO

84
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:02,708
THE UNITED STATES?

85
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:11,183
>> WELL, THEY WILL BE HELD

86
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:12,451
AND INTERVIEWED.

87
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:13,819
FAMILY UNIT WE HAVE A NINTH

88
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:14,753
CIRCUIT DECISION THAT CAN

89
00:02:14,753 --> 00:02:16,522
SAY WE CAN ONLY DETAIN

90
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:18,257
FAMILY UNITS UP TO 20 DAYS.

91
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:19,124
THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY HAVE A

92
00:02:19,124 --> 00:02:20,492
HEARING IN FRONT OF A JUDGE

93
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:21,760
THAT QUICK SO THEY

94
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,529
EVENTUALLY ARE RELEASED.

95
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:24,096
>> Tucker: NEWT UNITED

96
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:24,430
STATES?

97
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:24,763
>> YES.

98
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:25,631
WE HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO

99
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:26,732
LOOK AT THAT.

100
00:02:26,732 --> 00:02:27,633
IT'S CALLED THE FLORIDA

101
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:28,200
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

102
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,235
WE WANT THEM TO ADDRESS THAT

103
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:30,669
LEGISLATIVELY.

104
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:32,237
IF THEY CLOSE THESE LOP

105
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:33,439
HOLES WE CAN CONTROL THE

106
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:33,772
BORDER.

107
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:36,909
LAST YEAR 45% -- 45-YEAR LOW

108
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:38,510
IN BORDER CROSSINGS BECAUSE

109
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,313
THIS PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN

110
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:43,382
BORDER SECURITY SERIOUSLY.

111
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:45,551
ICE FINE MEN AND WOMEN OF

112
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:46,518
BORDER PATROL DO THE JOB.

113
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:47,920
NOW THE SMUGGLERS FIGURE OUT

114
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,254
THE LOOPHOLES AND USE THEM

115
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:49,822
AGAINST US.

116
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:51,256
CONGRESS NEEDS TO ACT AND

117
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:52,758
CLOSE THESE LOOPHOLES SO WE

118
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:54,159
CAN DO OUR JOB AND SECURE

119
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,961
THE BORDER.

120
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:56,628
>> Tucker: AS LONG AS YOU

121
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:58,330
CLAIM FEAR YOU CANNOT BE

122
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,498
IMMEDIATELY DEPORTED YOU ARE

123
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:00,132
RELEASED INTO THE UNITED

124
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:00,466
STATES.

125
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:01,366
>> IF YOU CLAIM FEAR AND YOU

126
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:03,068
GET INTERVIEWED AND CAN YOU

127
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:05,070
PASS A VERY LOW THRESHOLD

128
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,905
OF -- AND MOST THESE PEOPLE

129
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:07,840
BEING TRAINED AND TAUGHT

130
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,508
WHAT TO SAY BY GROUPS DOWN

131
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:11,477
IN MEXICO, COME IN AND MAKE

132
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:12,744
THAT CLAIM.

133
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:15,447
WE CANNOT REMOVE YOU.

134
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:17,649
THOSE CLAIMS HAVE TO BE

135
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:18,116
ADJUDICATED.

136
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:18,784
>> Tucker: WE ARE BASICALLY

137
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:19,151
HELPLESS.

138
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,786
WE HAVE HAMSTRUNG OURSELVES

139
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:21,386
IT SOUNDS LIKE?

140
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:23,455
>> AGAIN, IF WE FIX THE

141
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:24,623
LOOPHOLES, WE WOULD BE IN A

142
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:25,557
LOT BETTER POSITION.

143
00:03:25,557 --> 00:03:27,259
FOR INSTANCE, THE ADULTS WE

144
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:29,595
ARE DETAINING UNTIL THEY SEE

145
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:30,062
THE JUDGE.

146
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:32,264
THE FAMILY IS THE BIG ISSUE.

147
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:34,099
THAT'S WHAT MOST OF THESE

148
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,501
ARE FAMILY UNIT OR CHILDREN.

149
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:36,635
WE HAVE CERTAIN COURT

150
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:37,469
DECISIONS THAT LIMIT WHAT WE

151
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:38,136
CAN DO.

152
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,538
HOW LONG WE DETAIN THEM.

153
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:40,739
THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE

154
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:41,039
FIXED.

155
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,474
WE PRESENTED THAT TO

156
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:43,275
REPRESENTATIVES ON THE HILL

157
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:43,909
MONTHS AGO.

158
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:45,611
SO, IF THEY REALLY WANT TO

159
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:50,582
ADDRESS THIS MIGRATION THEY

160
00:03:50,582 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN SIMPLY HELP NEWS CLOSING
