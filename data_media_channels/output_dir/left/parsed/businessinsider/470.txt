our BLT really should be a TVL cuz it's
really about about the tomato our BLT of
witchcraft right now it's the most
popular selling sandwiches you imagine
but we only serve it from sort of
mid-july until probably mid September
it's only when we can get local tomatoes
and particularly tomatoes from one farm
eckerton farm Tim starchitect ursin farm
has by far the best tomatoes I've ever
had and so when he has Tomatoes that's
what we buy so our BLT really should be
a TVL cuz it's really about about the
tomato I think it's also important in
constructing the ingredients wet
ingredients on the outside drier
ingredients on the inside so if you're
using relishes or spreads outside on the
bread meat and stuff on the inside
