1
00:00:00,977 --> 00:00:02,145
APPEARS EVERYONE IS NOW

2
00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:07,817
READY FOR IT TO END.

3
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:08,618
MARTHA.

4
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:09,986
>> Martha: HERE NOW TAMMY

5
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:10,587
BRUCE PRESIDENT OF THE

6
00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:11,721
INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE

7
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:16,125
AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR

8
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:16,593
AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTER

9
00:00:16,593 --> 00:00:19,028
FATHER JONATHAN MORRIS AND

10
00:00:19,028 --> 00:00:19,362
ENRIQUE.

11
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:19,996
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

12
00:00:19,996 --> 00:00:21,197
PICTURES AND HISTORY OF THIS

13
00:00:21,197 --> 00:00:22,265
LAW, IT HAS BEEN IN PLACE

14
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:26,703
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

15
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:28,471
>> PHIL I THINK WE CAN AGREE

16
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:30,173
FAMILY SEPARATION IS CRUEL,

17
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:31,874
INHUMANE AND IN THIS CASE

18
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:32,508
COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIABLE.

19
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:33,743
THERE IS NO LAW IN OUR

20
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:35,178
IMMIGRATION BOOKS THAT SAYS

21
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:36,112
THAT CHILDREN CAN BE

22
00:00:36,112 --> 00:00:37,280
SEPARATED OR SHOULD BE

23
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,781
SEPARATED FROM THEIR

24
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:39,115
PARENTS.

25
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:40,416
THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE.

26
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,285
RIGHT NOW, WHAT WE HAVE A

27
00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:43,987
POLICY IMPLEMENTED BY THE

28
00:00:43,987 --> 00:00:45,154
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ZERO

29
00:00:45,154 --> 00:00:47,357
TOLERANCE THAT IS -- HAS

30
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:50,326
RESULTED IN OVER 1900 KIDS

31
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:52,228
BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR

32
00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:52,629
PARENTS.

33
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:53,363
>> Martha: LET ME ASK YOU

34
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:53,696
THIS.

35
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:56,432
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF JEFF

36
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:57,433
SESSIONS EXPLANATION WHEN HE

37
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:58,334
SAYS, YOU KNOW, WHEN A

38
00:00:58,334 --> 00:00:59,469
PARENT COMMITS A CRIME, THE

39
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:01,204
CHILD CANNOT GO TO JAIL WITH

40
00:01:01,204 --> 00:01:02,071
THEM IN ORDER TO KEEP THE

41
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:02,872
FAMILY TOGETHER.

42
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:03,940
AND THEY ARE SAYING,

43
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,308
CROSSING THE BORDER

44
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:06,576
ILLEGALLY IS BREAKING THE

45
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:07,110
LAW.

46
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,749
SO WHEN THAT HAPPENS,

47
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:14,584
UNFORTUNATELY, TEMPORARILY

48
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:15,885
WHILE THE PARENTS GO THROUGH

49
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:16,953
THE PROCESS BECAUSE THEY ARE

50
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:19,288
NOT GOING TO BE CAUGHT AND

51
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:19,656
RELEASED.

52
00:01:19,656 --> 00:01:20,456
THEY HAVE TO FIND SAFE

53
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:21,891
PLACES TO HOLD THESE

54
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:22,258
CHILDREN.

55
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:23,226
HAVE YOU IMAGES OF SOME OF

56
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:24,193
THOSE AREAS.

57
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:25,261
OBVIOUSLY IT'S A TERRIBLE

58
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:26,663
SITUATION FOR FAMILIES TO BE

59
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:27,363
SEPARATED.

60
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:28,264
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK

61
00:01:28,264 --> 00:01:35,905
AT IT THAT WAY, DOES THAT

62
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:37,807
MAKE A SENSE TO YOU.

63
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:39,075
>> THERE IS DISCRETION.

64
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:41,077
NOT PUTTING SHOPLIFTERS IN

65
00:01:41,077 --> 00:01:42,311
EVERY CASE AND NOT

66
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,179
SEPARATING THEM.

67
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:44,847
WE ARE NOT PUTTING

68
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:45,548
POSSESSION BEHIND BARS IN

69
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:46,482
EVERY CASE AND SEPARATING

70
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:47,750
THEM FROM THEIR CHILDREN.

71
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,618
AND THEY ARE ALSO BREAKING

72
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:49,185
THE LAW.

73
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:51,354
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS

74
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:51,754
DISCRETION.

75
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:53,122
BEFORE ZERO TOLERANCE

76
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:54,023
IMPLEMENTED THAT WAS THE

77
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:54,791
CASE WOMEN GRANT FAMILIES.

78
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:57,360
WE DON'T NEED TO SEPARATE

79
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,394
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND

80
00:01:58,394 --> 00:01:59,228
ALMOST 2,000 KIDS FROM THEIR

81
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:01,097
PARENTS JUST TO MAKE A POINT

82
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:04,333
AND USES THAT A DETERRENT.

83
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,835
CHIEF OF STAFF ATTORNEY

84
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,470
GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS HAS

85
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:07,837
SAID.

86
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:08,503
>> Martha: OTHER THING THEY

87
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,473
SAID SINCE THEY BECAME LAX

88
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:12,208
IN THIS PROGRAM IT WAS SORT

89
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,242
OF UNDERSTOOD BY SOME PEOPLE

90
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:14,577
WHO WANTED TO GET INTO THE

91
00:02:14,577 --> 00:02:17,447
COUNTRY THAT IF YOU COME AS

92
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:19,949
A FAMILY THEY WILL LET YOU

93
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:20,283
THROUGH.

94
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:21,284
BETTER WAY TO COME AND BRING

95
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:22,552
YOUR KIDS AND NOW OBVIOUSLY

96
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:23,119
THAT'S CHANGED.

97
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:24,687
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE

98
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:25,822
PROBLEMS WITH THE POLICY FOR

99
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:27,757
YEARS IS THAT WE EFFECTIVELY

100
00:02:27,757 --> 00:02:28,691
SUBSIDIZE THIS KIND OF

101
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,525
APPROACH THAT PEOPLE FOUND

102
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,527
OUT THAT IF YOU HAVE A CHILD

103
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,162
YOU WILL BE CAUGHT AND

104
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:33,629
RELEASED.

105
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:35,198
VERSUS NOT HAVING A CHILD.

106
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:35,798
THE "NEW YORK TIMES"

107
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:38,334
REPORTED IN APRIL THAT IN

108
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:40,336
FACT, PEOPLE ARE ADMITTING

109
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:41,237
THIS FAMILIES BROUGHT

110
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:42,405
CHILDREN KNOWING THERE WAS A

111
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:43,306
BETTER CHANCE THEY WOULD GET

112
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:44,640
THROUGH AND BE RELEASED AND

113
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,642
OTHERS, THIS IS THE SERIOUS

114
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:48,478
DYNAMIC WITH UNACCOMPANIED

115
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:50,012
MINORS, AND MINORS IN

116
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:51,581
CHILDREN ARE PEOPLE POSING

117
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:52,315
AS PARENTS.

118
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:54,717
SO HERE WE HAVE THE OUTRAGES

119
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:55,351
OVERCOMING THE FACTS.

120
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:56,953
I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

121
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:58,621
THREE REASONS WHY ADULTS OR

122
00:02:58,621 --> 00:02:59,822
PARENTS ARE SEPARATED FROM

123
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:00,423
CHILDREN.

124
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:01,824
ONE, THEY ARE POSING AS THE

125
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:03,726
PARENT AND THEY'RE NOT THE

126
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:04,060
PARENT.

127
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,595
THEY ARE A THREAT TO THE

128
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:05,962
CHILD.

129
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:07,263
OR THEY ARE PUT INTO

130
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:08,097
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS.

131
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:10,199
THIS IS -- IT'S NOT A WHOLE

132
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,500
SCALE.

133
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,601
>> ZERO TOLERANCE.

134
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:13,269
>> AND SO THIS IS ALSO,

135
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:14,604
AGAIN, SOMETHING THAT WAS

136
00:03:14,604 --> 00:03:16,672
HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE

137
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:17,940
OBAMA REGIME AS WELL.

138
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,475
BUT IT COMES DOWN TO CATCH

139
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:23,780
AND RELEASE.

140
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,017
BUT WE HAVE FACILITATED THE

141
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:29,652
PARENTS BRING ACROSS THE

142
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:31,087
BORDER IN A WAY GAME THE

143
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:31,420
SYSTEM.

144
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,356
THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT

145
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:34,090
WANTS TO STOPPED.

146
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,525
HE STATED HE WANTS IT

147
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:35,858
STOPPED.

148
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:37,527
ALL OF US ARE OUTRAGED THAT

149
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:38,961
WE ARE EVEN IN THIS DYNAMIC

150
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:40,363
AND IT COMES DOWN TO AN OR

151
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:42,398
DID HELY IMMIGRATION DYNAMIC

152
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:43,199
AND SECURITY AT THE BORDER

153
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,567
WHERE WE CAN TREAT EVERYONE

154
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,202
WITH DIGNITY AND PEOPLE ARE

155
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,104
NOT ENCOURAGED TO MOVE INTO

156
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:50,072
THE COUNTRY IN THIS FASHION.

157
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:52,475
>> Martha: LET ME BRING IN

158
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:53,376
FATHER JONATHAN.

159
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:54,811
HAVE YOU CATHOLIC BISHOPS

160
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:56,379
AND FRANKLY GRAHAM ARGUING

161
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,747
THESE FAMILIES NEED TO BE

162
00:03:57,747 --> 00:03:59,315
HELD TOGETHER.

163
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:00,216
CATHOLIC BISHOP ARGUE GOING

164
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:01,184
ANYONE IS HELPING TO

165
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:02,819
IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM AND

166
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,020
IS CATHOLIC THEY COULD

167
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,555
POTENTIALLY BE EXCOMIEWRN

168
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:06,389
INDICATED FOR BEING PART OF

169
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:06,656
IT.

170
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:09,358
>> OKAY.

171
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:09,659
THAT.

172
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,194
>> WAS ONE BISHOP WHO

173
00:04:11,194 --> 00:04:11,928
ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THAT I

174
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:12,695
DON'T THINK IT REPRESENTS

175
00:04:12,695 --> 00:04:13,129
ALL OF THEM.

176
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,997
THE FACT IS THAT WE HAVE 20%

177
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:16,298
MORE CHILDREN IN THIS

178
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,600
SITUATION SEPARATED FROM

179
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,905
THEIR CHILDREN THIS YEAR

180
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:24,140
COMPARED TOO LAST YEAR.

181
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,274
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

182
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:26,742
WE HAVE TO SOLVE.

183
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:28,044
THIS WE'RE NOT THAT FAR AWAY

184
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:29,679
FROM SOLVING IT.

185
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:30,346
BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP AS WELL

186
00:04:30,346 --> 00:04:31,180
AS THE REPUBLICAN AND THE

187
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,950
DEMOCRATS ALSO THIS IS AN

188
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,351
OUTRAGEOUS SITUATION.

189
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,385
WHOSE FAULT IS IT?

190
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:37,653
OF COURSE THERE ARE PEOPLE

191
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,655
WHO ARE FAKING BRINGING

192
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,290
CHILDREN OVER AND SAYING

193
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,525
THAT THEY ARE THEIR CHILDREN

194
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:43,159
THAT'S NOT.

195
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,160
OF COURSE THERE ARE PEOPLE

196
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,895
BREAKING THE LAW COMING OVER

197
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:46,262
ILLEGALLY.

198
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:50,066
ALL OF THAT IS BAD.

199
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:52,768
THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE

200
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:53,703
BIGGER THAN THAT TO SAY WHAT

201
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:55,338
ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

202
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:56,505
THERE ARE CHILDREN THERE

203
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,206
ALONE.

204
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:58,608
IT'S TRAUMATIC FOR THEM.

205
00:04:58,608 --> 00:04:59,642
TRAUMATIZING FOR THEM.

206
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:01,777
SAY THIS NOT FROM A

207
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:02,445
THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE.

208
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:05,047
I LIVE IN THE SOUTH BRONX.

209
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:08,751
I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

210
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:11,320
THESE FAMILIES WITH THESE

211
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,687
CHILDREN.

212
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:12,922
I SEE CHILDREN WHO ARE HERE

213
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:13,723
WITHOUT PARENTS.

214
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:14,023
OKAY.

215
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:17,059
THE PARENTS ARE DEFINITELY

216
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:17,960
NOT PERFECT AND THEY

217
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,061
SHOULDN'T BE CROSSING

218
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:20,529
ILLEGALLY BUT THE GOVERNMENT

219
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,664
HAS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE

220
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:22,865
ARE GOING TO DO FOR THE SAKE

221
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:26,736
OF THESE CHILDREN.

222
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:27,603
>> Martha: WHAT DO THEY DO?

223
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:29,305
DO THEY CHANGE THE LAW?

224
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:31,741
DO THEY INCARCERATE FAMILIES

225
00:05:31,741 --> 00:05:32,575
TOGETHER?

226
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:33,309
ENRIQUE, WHAT'S THE

227
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:33,676
SOLUTION?

228
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:34,610
YOU HAVE THE FOLKS WHO ARE

229
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,311
BREAKING THE LAW.

230
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:36,779
AND THERE SALAH THERE IS A

231
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:37,113
BORDER.

232
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:38,281
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CROSS

233
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:39,482
THE BORDER ILLEGALLY AND

234
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:40,783
THEN YOU HAVE, I THINK

235
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:41,450
EVERYONE HERE IN THIS

236
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,318
CONVERSATION AND OUTSIDE OF

237
00:05:42,318 --> 00:05:44,086
IT WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS

238
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:46,055
THAT THIS IS NOT AN IDEAL

239
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:46,422
SITUATION.

240
00:05:46,422 --> 00:05:47,323
THE PRESIDENT MADE THAT

241
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:48,057
CLEAR HIMSELF.

242
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,325
>> I APPRECIATE THE

243
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:49,825
QUESTION, MARTHA.

244
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:51,260
WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON

245
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,627
SOLUTIONS.

246
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:52,662
I THINK THE SOLUTION IS NOT

247
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:53,462
SEPARATING FAMILIES.

248
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:55,798
THERE ARE VERY FEW EXAMPLES

249
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:57,266
OF GOVERNMENT USING FAMILY

250
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:57,900
SEPARATION THROUGHOUT

251
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,334
HISTORY.

252
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,368
WE DON'T WANTS TO BE PART OF

253
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:00,770
THAT THE SOLUTION IS JUST

254
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,538
NOT BUILDING WALLS AND

255
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:03,940
REDUCING THE LEGAL PATH FOR

256
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,107
IMMIGRANTS TO COME INTO THIS

257
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:06,275
COUNTRY AND, AGAIN,

258
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:06,943
SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM

259
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:07,543
THEIR PARENTS.

260
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:08,811
I THINK THE SOLUTION HAS TO

261
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,047
DO WITH FINDING THE ROOT

262
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:12,081
CAUSES OF IMMIGRATION.

263
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,617
HAVING A WIDER LEGAL PATH

264
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:15,584
PEOPLE COME HERE AND DO THE

265
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,686
JOBS WE NEED THEM TO DO.

266
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:18,087
A LOT OF SOLUTIONS THAT

267
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,121
WEEKEND, YOU KNOW, AGREE ON

268
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:23,359
IN CONGRESS.

269
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:25,461
BUT EXTREMES TAKING OVER THE

270
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:26,929
DEBATE AND NO SPACE FOR

271
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,898
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION.

272
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:31,033
>> Martha: YOU HAVE A COUPLE

273
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,435
OF THOSE GOING TO BE

274
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:33,402
CONSIDERED EVENTUALLY IT

275
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:35,304
LOOKS LIKE WOULD ALLOW

276
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:36,639
$25 BILLION TO BUILD THE

277
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,673
WALL AS WELL AS A SOLUTION

278
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:38,874
TO THIS PROBLEM TO KEEP

279
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:39,809
FAMILIES TOGETHER.

280
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:41,777
SO IS THAT A WORKABLE

281
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:42,144
SOLUTION?

282
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:44,780
TAMMY AND FATHER JONATHAN.

283
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,349
>> WE DEFINITELY WANT,

284
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,117
ESPECIALLY IF THIS DYNAMIC

285
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,852
WHERE YOU CAN KEEP A FAMILY

286
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:50,786
TOGETHER WITHIN A SEPARATE

287
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:51,721
KIND OF FACILITY SO, YOU

288
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,422
DON'T HAVE TO SEPARATE THEM.

289
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:55,324
AND THEN THAT PROCESS IS

290
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:59,695
VERY QUICK, AS A MATTER OF

291
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:02,064
FACT, THEN THEY BECOME HOME

292
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:02,798
AS A UNIT.

293
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,467
COULD THEY GO BACK HOME TO

294
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,501
THEIR HOME COUNTRY AND

295
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:06,802
OTHERS WANT THEM RELEASED

296
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,605
HERE THAT CAN BE VERY QUICK

297
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:09,972
FRAMEWORK.

298
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,374
KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER

299
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:12,341
ONCE A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING

300
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:13,409
IS OVER USUALLY WITHIN THE

301
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:15,544
SAME DAY AND THEN SENT HOME.

302
00:07:15,544 --> 00:07:23,953
THE OTHER FRAMEWORK, THIS IS

303
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:25,087
HOW WE HANDLE KEEPING

304
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:26,522
FAMILIES TOGETHER WHILE ALSO

305
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:27,690
RESPECTING OUR LAWS HERE AT

306
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:27,990
HOME.

307
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,592
>> MARTHA, WE CAN'T FORGET

308
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:30,593
THAT THERE IS TREMENDOUS

309
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:33,729
AMOUNT OF HYPOCRISY OVER

310
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:34,864
MANY DIFFERENT

311
00:07:34,864 --> 00:07:35,331
ADMINISTRATIONS.

312
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,299
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE -- WE

313
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:38,901
ARE RIGHT NOW ALLOWING

314
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:40,803
PEOPLE TO COME IN, GIVING

315
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:42,405
THEM WORK, NO DOUBT, GIVING

316
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:43,906
THEM WORK AND THEN SAYING

317
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:45,474
HEY, LISTEN, BUT YOU CAN'T

318
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:46,976
BE FULL MEMBERS OF OUR

319
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:47,309
SOCIETY.

320
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:49,712
BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO DO

321
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:50,312
EVERIFY SYSTEM.

322
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:52,214
IN OUR SYSTEM WE DO NOT WANT

323
00:07:52,214 --> 00:07:57,653
TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT WHO IS

324
00:07:57,653 --> 00:07:57,987
ILLEGAL.

325
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:00,022
WE CAN'T FORGET THAT WE ARE

326
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:00,856
TAKING ADVANTAGE AND THERE

327
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:01,957
ARE CHILDREN WHO ARE GROWING

328
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:03,426
UP RIGHT NOW WHO HAVE BEEN

329
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:04,994
HERE IN THE COUNTRY FOR

330
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:06,829
THEIR WHOLE LIVES OR WITH

331
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:08,197
FAMILIES WHO SIMPLY, THE

332
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,266
PARENTS ARE WORKING BUT THEY

333
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:11,200
CANNOT BECOME FULL MEMBERS

334
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,303
OF OUR SOCIETY AND IT'S NOT

335
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:14,737
HELPFUL.

336
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:15,371
>> Martha: POLITICS DON'T

337
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,105
GET IN THE WAY OF A

338
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:16,472
SOLUTION.

339
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:17,473
BOTH SIDES WOULD REALLY

340
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:18,908
RATHER NOT HAVE THE OTHER

341
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:19,708
SIDE INVOLVED TO COME UP

342
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,277
WITH A SOLUTION IT SEEMS

343
00:08:21,277 --> 00:00:00,000
WITH THIS VERY HOT DEBATE.
