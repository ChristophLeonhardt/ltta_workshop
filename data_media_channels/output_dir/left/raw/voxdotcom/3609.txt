1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,340
I can't believe that's a real sentence.

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,280
Okay. Focus.

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,850
Oh my god, I'm trapped in a nightmare.

4
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,840
All right. Last one.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,840
How do you feel watching this?

6
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:30,869
Same reaction?

7
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:31,540
No?

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,439
You feel numb, don't you?

9
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,660
If you've been watching the news for the past
12 months,

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,780
your reaction to that last clip was probably,
"meh.”

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,740
There's a term for what you're experiencing.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,090
It's called the Overton Window.

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,210
It's a concept in political science that says
there is this

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,560
window of ideas the public is willing to accept.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,700
Everything inside the window is normal and
expected.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,860
Everything outside the window is radical,
ridiculous, or unthinkable.

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,230
And the theory goes that if you want to move
the window,

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,190
if you want to change what people think of
as acceptable,

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,530
you shouldn't start here.

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,560
You should start here, at the extreme.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,220
Because forcing people to consider an unthinkable
idea,

22
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,750
even if they reject it, makes all less-radical
ideas

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,240
seem more acceptable by comparison.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,390
It shifts the window in that direction.

25
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,110
So if you want to make people more accepting
of gay relationships,

26
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,860
you should start by arguing for gay marriage.

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,110
You'll lose at first, but you'll start to
make things like

28
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,580
domestic partnerships seem more plausible.

29
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,030
Then civil unions start to seem normal too.

30
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,720
Pretty soon, what started off as an unthinkable
idea

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,390
seems very thinkable.

32
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,390
Even boring.

33
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,320
The point of the Overton Window is that people

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,810
don't have to accept a ridiculous idea, they
just have to get used to it,

35
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,700
have to hear enough to start comparing other
ideas to it.

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,450
And that might be the scariest part of Trump's
first year in office.

37
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,170
Not how abnormal he is,

38
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,800
but how normal he makes everything else look
by comparison.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,360
This is not normal.

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
This is not normal.

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
This is not normal.

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
This is not normal.

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
But it keeps happening.

44
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,130
In just the past six months, we've had to
talk about the president

45
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,070
sympathizing with white supremacists,

46
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,700
retweeting anti-Muslim propaganda from a hate
group,

47
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,630
calling a world leader short and fat

48
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,270
while threatening nuclear war on Twitter.

49
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,949
I'm not!

50
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,100
Any of these stories would have been unthinkable

51
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,571
under Obama or even Bush.

52
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:16,170
But now they're things we have to seriously
talk about.

53
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,640
That means getting used to a lot of new realities
over here,

54
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,970
in Trumpland.

55
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,640
And that's shifted the Overton Window

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,690
in some really terrifying ways.

57
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,760
Sounds so ominous.

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
The Overton Window.

59
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,120
The Overton Window.

60
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,750
The most obvious is that we now just

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,500
expect to be bullshitted.

62
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,740
At the start of Trump's term,

63
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,450
we were shocked at the White House lying

64
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,620
about the size of Trump's inauguration crowd.

65
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,170
It undermines the credibility of the entire

66
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,381
White House Press Office on day one.

67
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:43,130
Don't be so overly dramatic.

68
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,130
But now?

69
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,880
The president in no way has ever encouraged
violence.

70
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,080
I don't think it's appropriate to lie from
the podium

71
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
or any other place.

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,100
I wouldn't say it was a lie.

73
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,370
That's a pretty bold accusation.

74
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,400
Yeah, she's a liar.

75
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,640
What else is new?

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,900
That's especially true for news coverage.

77
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,140
There's Kellyanne Conway,

78
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,320
Will the president do anything?

79
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,860
What do you mean, “Will he do anything?”

80
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,420
CNN's army of Trump parrots,

81
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,260
Breitbart trolls,

82
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,330
Alex Jones getting a major interview on national
television.

83
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,680
Do you think of yourself as a journalist?

84
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,400
I have some journalists that work for me.

85
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,880
Normally these people would be relegated

86
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,850
to the dark corners of the internet.

87
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,960
But thanks to Trump, news networks feel compelled

88
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,860
to put them on TV, to put them in the mainstream.

89
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,680
Alex Jones isn't going away.

90
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,680
He has millions of listeners and the ear of
our current president.

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,330
God damn it, Megyn Kelly.

92
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,860
But what's scarier is what's happening over
here —

93
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,650
the stuff that feels kind of boring under
Trump.

94
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,459
One of the weird side effects of this presidency

95
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,100
is that big Trump debates are rarely just

96
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,010
between Democrats and Republicans.

97
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,610
They're often between Trump supporters

98
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,190
and anti-Trump conservatives —

99
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,350
conservatives who think Trump has gone too
far.

100
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,160
I will note this is a two-Republican panel.

101
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,690
These debates are really attractive to news
outlets.

102
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,680
It's interesting when somebody bucks their
party.

103
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,730
And so you've seen anti-Trump conservatives
take up

104
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,040
more and more space in political debates.

105
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,080
You can see that trend really clearly in the
makeup

106
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,519
of CNN's panels, which now almost always

107
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,470
feature anti-Trump conservatives.

108
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,709
People like Iraq War architect Bill Kristol,

109
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,159
who represented the far right in the Obama
years,

110
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,190
You supported Sarah Palin.

111
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,059
She's not a big business, big corporation
type.

112
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,069
But now plays the part of the middle ground.

113
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,069
He's a jackass.

114
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,389
I'm just going to say it.

115
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:32,919
The middle ground!

116
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,190
No, no.

117
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,569
You can find examples of middle-grounding
everywhere.

118
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:39,580
After years of race baiting and toeing the
conservative line on Fox,

119
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,240
Megan Kelly now has her own show on NBC.

120
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,219
Bear with me, please.

121
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:46,110
MSNBC, which normally leans left,

122
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,710
has added two conservative hosts in Trump's
first year,

123
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,779
both who made names for themselves

124
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,650
by being critical of Trump during the campaign.

125
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,599
The New York Times hired conservative columnist
Bret Stephens,

126
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,069
a guy who's called anti-Semitism a "disease of the Arab mind"

127
00:04:58,069 --> 00:04:59,960
and who doubts the reality of climate change.

128
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,320
When announcing their decision to hire Stephens,

129
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,740
The New York Times explicitly cited his opposition

130
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,300
to Trump during the campaign.

131
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,419
The problem isn't that these are conservative
voices.

132
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,780
Because we're comparing them to Trump trolls,

133
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,749
they end up representing the middle

134
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:19,020
or even the left

135
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
of public debates.

136
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,800
Your side, the left wing of America, lost
this election.

137
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
The Overton Window has moved.

138
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,699
The Overton Window.

139
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,259
I regret making this joke already.

140
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,039
The result is news coverage with

141
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,060
dramatically lowered expectations,

142
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,229
where success for Republicans doesn't mean
governing well,

143
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,559
it just means not being Trump.

144
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:39,400
Trump delivers a normal-sounding speech

145
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,800
and suddenly he's presidential.

146
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,319
I thought the tone was spot on.

147
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,490
He owned that room.

148
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,900
Trump nominates Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme
Court

149
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,039
and Washington breathes a sigh of relief.

150
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,869
The nomination and confirmation of Neil Gorsuch

151
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:55,059
remains an enormously significant win.

152
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:57,690
The bar is so low that there's no real room

153
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,240
to have a serious policy debate about anything.

154
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,559
It was nice to be sitting in that chamber
again.

155
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,169
And going, “Oh, okay.

156
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:05,169
Republicans like this.

157
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:06,319
Democrats hate this.”

158
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,110
It was almost normal last night.

159
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,789
And you can see it especially in the coverage

160
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:12,669
of the Republican tax reform bill.

161
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:13,870
By any measure,

162
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,560
the bill in the Senate was a disaster for
democracy.

163
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,340
Republicans agreed to pass the bill before
it was even written.

164
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,160
It was covered in sloppy handwritten amendments.

165
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,240
They're sending around their edits as we speak.

166
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,559
Can you tell me what that word is?

167
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:31,280
And it passed in the dead of night on a party-line
vote,

168
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,449
including a $250 billion error.

169
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:35,749
That should be a nightmare

170
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:38,110
that haunts Republicans into the midterms.

171
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,499
But the next morning, Trump was tweeting about
Michael Flynn.

172
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,020
And what should have been a stain on the GOP

173
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,520
was reframed as a big accomplishment

174
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,569
that Trump's tweeting was distracting from.

175
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,300
Despite the big win, Russian election meddling

176
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,000
shadows the Trump administration.

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,639
What should be a celebratory weekend here
at the White House,

178
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,229
instead all the attention is focused on Mike
Flynn.

179
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,580
Stuff like the tax reform bill seems small
when

180
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,849
Trump is making conspiracy theories and threatening
nuclear war.

181
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,550
But at some point, Trump won't be president
anymore.

182
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,719
And when that happens,

183
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,789
we're going to have to reckon with a media
environment

184
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:12,409
that's been trained to view traditional conservatives
as a huge relief.

185
00:07:12,409 --> 00:00:00,000
As the new middle ground.
