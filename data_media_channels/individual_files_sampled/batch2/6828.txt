after actor Aaron Rapp uncovered details of how he was sexually assaulted by Kevin Spacey as we expected it has opened the floodgates for other male actors in Hollywood to share their stories now interestingly enough the gardening The Guardian is reporting that more Hollywood actors are speaking of rampant problems of male abusers targeting other men in the industry and I think it's it's relevant and it's worth talking about because a lot of the emphasis is placed on female victims but there are a ton of male victims as well and as I've mentioned before there's usually even more stigma toward them coming out and talking about their experiences and I want to you know show them some admiration for their courage and coming out and talking about what they've experienced so Alex winter who's an actor based out of London talked about what he also experienced as a gay male actor who was preyed upon by other males who had more power than him he says it's a very taboo subject I don't know of any boys in any pocket of the entertainment industry that do not encounter some form of predatory behavior it's really not a safe environment Wow okay so there's another actor who spoke out Wilson Cruz who's a gay actor who plays raps interestingly enough raps love interest in Star Trek recently spoke out about sexual harassment at a gay lesbian and straight Education Network Awards event saying that an older gentleman made offers when he was young adding I did not take them up on it it was uncomfortable I was in my 20s and I thought is this what one does right yeah and then he was worried that his decision not to act on it would hurt his career which I think a lot of people do worry about yeah and that's why a lot of these people prey on on younger people whether they're male or female because they think they're not going to know what the standard is they don't know what's right and wrong and I could pretend like it's normal and it's it and they have no power and when they have no power it's easier to take advantage of them and in the movie industry unfortunately in that taemin industry overall the gatekeepers in the old days before the internet had all of the power so when you have that kind of power disparity and you put in honestly men into the equation and from time to time women do it as well but it's far more prevalent among men both gay and straight mid SEM it's a dynamic for a lot of abuse and harassment and so it's not at all surprised look I've told you guys about this over the last couple of weeks just because I kept hearing from several different people never anything specific and they never named anyone right but they for years folks who come in here for interviews etc I've been like whoa you know one day that'll come out how much it happens among you know in in gay Hollywood and and so I just you have to remember there's also victims who are also either straight or gay right who've been harassed by by those powerful men I don't think anyone's sexual orientation is any indication as to whether or not they're likely to be a sexual predator so let's just get that out of the way that's a very ridiculous notion however I think that oftentimes people who are in positions of power will abuse it if they think that it's okay to prey on those who don't have power right again sexual orientation has nothing to do with it Harvey Weinstein obviously not gay right but Nero Riley Roger Ailes Bill Cosby so that's exactly our point which is that being gay doesn't magically make you not part of the you know human interactions and family of course they have the same reactions power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely to think that they are either better or worse as preposterous and unfortunately we're seeing some of the damage that was done in this situation as well and it's time for those men to speak up and they are to fight back so that doesn't happen to the next generation if you like this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
