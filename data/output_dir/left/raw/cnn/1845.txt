1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:11,519
what did you just go through back there
hell how much water is in your house you

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,220
can see just people are relieved to at
least be too dry water you can imagine

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:24,600
just what they've gone through over the
past 12 hours okay all right we got you

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,590
don't worry don't worry we got you we
got you don't worry

5
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:35,579
there's been no cell service since
Thursday Friday haven't gotten ahold of

6
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:45,050
anybody okay the Omni Royal Court

7
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:58,610
okay dad I love you it was over five
feet in our house we barely made it out

8
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,140
I'm just so grateful that they came

9
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,410
it hurts because you see people work
their lives to build something in any

10
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,770
one night it's all gone
for me most of it is gone I'll build

11
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,580
back I've got a strong working parents
that made me believe hard work to get

12
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:24,570
you back I'll get going it it's just
hard to see everything it's gone

13
00:01:24,570 --> 00:00:00,000
everything's gone we're gonna try to see
what we can salvage from the wreck
