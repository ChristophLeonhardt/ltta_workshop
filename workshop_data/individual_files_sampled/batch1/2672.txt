Donald Trump is responding to a number of factors that are global you have limited economic opportunity slow growth a sense that the world and communities are changing very quickly because of immigration and population flows a sense that technology is taking over people's lives taking over their jobs and so I think if you look around the world people are facing these issues and they're being expressed or are being responded to by populist and political entrepreneurs in different ways in Philippines you have president duterte who's responding to a concern about personal safety and the drug wars and tapping into again a very visceral personal concern that individuals have in that country so that's a very populist and popular strategy for him in China President Xi is tapping into aspiration for greater national pride and a greater national presence on the glow on a global scale and so he is tapping into a long history centuries long history of Chinese global power and trying to rekindle that that and that boost his own power if you look at President Erewhon and in Turkey again trying to reconstitute and rebuild Turkey's place as a regional power basically reclaiming the Ottoman Empire for Turkey and Turkish pride in a time when Turkey has had slow growth economic challenges and so national issues political issues these kinds of Appeals are an alternative for economic growth and prosperity
