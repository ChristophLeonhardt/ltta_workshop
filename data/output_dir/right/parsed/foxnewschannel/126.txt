>> Greg: REMEMBER BROOKE
BALDWIN?
SHE FACED DOWN A LONE VOICE IN
DEFENSE OF THE MOB.
IT WAS LIKELY REVERSED DAVID AND
GOLIATH.
>> WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE LIKE
TED CRUZ GETTING CHASED OUT OF
RESTAURANTS BY A MOB.
>> YOU ARE NOT GOING TO USE THE
MOB WORD.
>> IT IS TOTALLY A MOB.
THERE IS NO OTHER WORD FOR IT.
>> STOP, STOP.
>> Greg: STOP.
TUESDAY BALDWIN WAS ON COLBERT
DEFENDING THE EFFORT TO USE THE
M WORD TO DESCRIBE GROUPS OF
UNRULY, INTIMIDATING PEOPLE
TARGETING ONE PERSON.
SORRY, I MEAN A MOB.
>> WHEN HE BROUGHT THEM ALL
BOARDED UP AGAIN, I CALLED HIM
OUT.
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE WORD
POLICE, THAT WAS NOT MY
INTENTION BUT I ALSO BELIEVE IN
CALLING OUT TALKING POINTS.
TO HEAR HIM BRING THAT UP, I HAD
TO SAY SOMETHING.
>> Greg: GET THAT?
ANY OPINION BALDWIN DOESN'T LIKE
IS A TALKING POINT.
I WONDER IF MEDIA MATTERS TOLD
HER TO SEE     SAY THAT.
SHE SAYS CALLING OUT A MOB
SOMEHOW GROUPTHINK.
WHEN YOU TRY TO DEFEND SOMEONE
FROM A LARGE INCA GROUP, YOU'RE
REALLY JUST A SHEEP.
REMINDS ME OF THE OTHER M WORD.
BROOKE BALDWIN ISN'T EVEN
RELATED TO ALEX.
IT'S NOT WOKE TO PORTRAY A MOB
AS PROTESTERS.
WHEN YOU OFFER EXCUSES FOR
HARASSMENT, YOU BECOME ITS
DEFENDER AT AIRPORTS,
RESTAURANTS, CAMPUSES, STREETS,
ONLINE.
IF YOU'VE NEVER SAID ANYTHING
THAT STOOD YOU APART FROM THE
CROWD, HOW WOULD YOU EVEN KNOW?
BEFORE YOU CITE RIGHT-WING
ANOMALIES, THAT'S MERELY FRINGE
FOR THE LEFT.
IT'S NOW MAINSTREAM.
THERE'S A NEW ONE OR TWO EVERY
DAY.
LIKE THE PROFESSOR TELLING
PEOPLE TO CONTAMINATE OR STEAL
THE FOOD OF REPUBLICANS AND
RESTAURANTS.
JUST ANOTHER MISCREANT INCITING
MOB ACTION BUILT UPON PREVIOUS
EXCITEMENTS BY LEFTIST LEADERS,
CELEBS, AND ACTIVIST.
I GUESS THAT'S A PROTEST TOO.
IF THE TARGET IS ON THE RIGHT,
THEY HAD IT COMING AND
EVERYTHING ELSE IS A TALKING
POINT.
JESSE, EVERYBODY HAS TALKING
POINTS.
IT SEEMS TO BE CNN HAD A TALKING
POINT, LIKE ON EVERY SHOW, IF
YOU SAID MOB, THEY WERE TOLD YOU
CAN'T SAY THAT.
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE SHE WAS
PROJECTING.
>> Jesse: THE WORD MOB IS NOT
A TALKING POINT.
IF I WERE TO GO ON HER SHOW AND
SAY TRUMP IS RUNNING ON JOBS AND
THE DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING ON
MOBS, THAT WOULD BE A TALKING
POINT.
SHE COULD CALL ME OUT.
I WOULD PROVE HER WRONG WITH MY
FAX.
I DON'T MIND BROOKE BALDWIN.
I THINK SHE HAS A COMPELLING
SHOW.
HER LAST NIGHT, 700,000 --
DOUBLED HER AUDIENCE.
I LOOKED AT THE RATINGS.
BROOKE DOES BEAT MSNBC BUT
THAT'S NOT THAT HARD.
SHE JUST HAS TO BE HONEST ABOUT
WHO SHE HAS.
SHE'S ACTING LIKE SHE'S AN
UMPIRE CALLING BALLS AND
STRIKES.
SHE IS NOT.
SHE'S AN ADVOCATE FOR THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND PLAYING
WORD GAMES TO DEFEND THE DNC.
THE DEMOCRATS, KENNEDY, BANNED
WORDS ALL THE TIME.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, POCAHONTAS,
ILLEGAL ALIENS, RADICAL ISLAM.
REMEMBER THE CNN PROMO.
IT'S AN APPLE.
THEY WON'T TELL YOU IT'S AN
APPLE.
THEY SAY IT'S A BANANA.
THEY ARE LOOKING AT A MOB AND
TELLING YOU IT'S A BANANA.
>> Kennedy: IF ONLY MOBS HAVE
THAT MUCH POTASSIUM.
IT'S REALLY SAD, MY BROTHER WHO
WAS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, KEEP
SENDING ME VIDEOS OF PROTESTERS
IN PORTLAND AND HOW THEY ARE
TORTURING AND TERRORIZING PEOPLE
THERE.
IT'S NOT OKAY.
IT MEANS YOU'VE GIVEN UP ON
IDEAS.
IT MEANS THERE'S AN INTELLECTUAL
REVERSION IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE ARE REVERTING BACK TO,
ESSENTIALLY, PEOPLE WITHOUT
RATIONAL BRAINS AND CEREBRAL
CORTEX IS.
USING EMOJIS AND SO THE WORDS,
ESSENTIALLY HIEROGLYPHICS.
IT'S FUNNY.
PEOPLE THINK IT'S A WINNING
STRATEGY IN WINNING OPTICS BUT
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH THE CARAVANS AND THE VISUAL
YOU GET FROM THAT AND IF YOU
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH
THE MOB CLEVE GOT TO BE KIND OF
CAREFUL BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO ARE SECRETLY VOTING.
SCARES THE LIVING BANANA OUT OF
ME.
>> Dana: I DON'T INVITE PEOPLE
ONTO DUE TALKING POINTS.
JUST KIDDING.
MATT LEWIS, WHO SHE WAS TALKING
TO, HE'S NOT WORKING FOR ANY
CANDIDATE OR PARTY, SO HE
DOESN'T HAVE TO DO ANYBODY'S
TALKING POINTS.
>> Greg: HE IS AN INDEPENDENT
THINKER.
>> Dana: HE HAS A GREAT
PODCAST, GOOD WRITER.
IF YOU HAD SOMEBODY ON WHO WAS A
SPOKESPERSON FOR A GROUP, THEN
THEY USUALLY GIVE YOU TALKING
POINTS.
SOMEONE LIKE MATT LEWIS IS AN
ANALYST.
>> Greg: JUAN, THE DIFFERENCE
IS A MOB IS ABOUT INTIMIDATION.
PROTESTERS ARE ABOUT DIALOGUE.
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE, AND A LOT
OF THOSE PEOPLE AREN'T
INTERESTED IN HEARING ANYBODY
ELSE.
>> Juan: YOU HAVE TWO THINGS.
ONE IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THE FRENCH AND THE MAINSTREAM.
I THINK IN FACT WHEN I THINK OF
CHARLOTTESVILLE, I THINK OF A
MOB.
A VIOLENT MOB.
WHEN I THINK OF PEOPLE LIKE
THOSE IN PORTLAND THAT YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT, I THINK SOMETIMES
THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE
HOMELESS, INVOLVED WITH DRUGS
AND THEY PICK UP ON THIS BECAUSE
THEY SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACT
OUT, IN MY OPINION.
I DON'T SEE IT AS PART OF THE
MOB, BUT I MUST SAY THE RIGHT
HAS PLUGGED INTO THAT WORD AS A
VEHICLE FOR SAYING TO THEIR
VOTERS, HEY, WE ARE FACING BAD
GUYS, A MOB OUT THERE, AND I
THINK THAT'S WHAT BROOKE BALDWIN
WAS DOING.
SHE WAS SAYING DON'T JUST USE
THE WORD HELTER-SKELTER BECAUSE
IT FITS THE REPUBLICAN TALKING
POINTS FOR THE MIDTERM
ELECTIONS.
IF YOU SEE A MOB, COLLECT A MOB.
HE WAS TYING ABOUT PEOPLE
HARASSING SOMEONE IN A
RESTAURANT.
>> Kennedy: YOU HAVE SOME
DEMOCRATS CALLING FOR MOBS.
THAT'S THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE.
PEOPLE AT CORY BOOKER AND MAXINE
WATERS AND THE PROFESSOR AT
OLE MISS, WHICH IS A GREAT
SCHOOL.
