1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,324
- It's an ode to the way
that things used to be made.

2
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:04,740
It's not just something
that's been mass produced

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,250
or put through a line
and made millions of.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,008
We make them hand-by-hand,
individually, each one.

5
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:12,562
There's definitely faster ways.

6
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:14,376
There's ways to cut corners.

7
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:17,890
But how do we make something
without cutting any corners?

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,530
What's the best way we can do it?

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,580
It's a long way to do it.

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,810
It's a hard way to do it.

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,933
But if there's a way to do it that way,

12
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,379
then we figure it out.

13
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:26,412
You can really see that in the quality

14
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:27,990
of the bags when you get one.

15
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,033
When you hold one.

16
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,810
My name is Lindy McDonough,

17
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,810
and I am the Creative
Director at Lotuff Leather.

18
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,730
For us, we grew up in New England,

19
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,251
and I would get a bag one season.

20
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,080
It would have a big logo on it.

21
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,370
And then two seasons later,

22
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,170
you'd almost be embarrassed to have it.

23
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,500
And that's not in New England

24
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,074
how we grow up, how we have goods.

25
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:52,620
You should have a thing that you

26
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,134
can pass down to your next generation

27
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:56,447
that's gonna get more
beautiful as you use it.

28
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:59,403
And that was always the
ethos for the company.

29
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,200
The Triumph briefcase,

30
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,001
from the outside, it looks very clean.

31
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:06,180
But it's actually a very complicated bag.

32
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,483
It's one of the most
difficult bags that we make.

33
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,050
Takes about four to six
weeks to make each one.

34
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,883
There's no rushing that.

35
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:16,132
And the bag has about 61
individual pieces in each bag.

36
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:18,578
We start on the cutting table.

37
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,400
We roll out a hide.

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,357
Our hides all come from
a family-owned tannery.

39
00:01:23,357 --> 00:01:25,365
Our leather is all made specially for us.

40
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:28,171
All of the leather is
fully vegetable tanned,

41
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,963
so no chromium, no formaldehyde,
nothing in the base.

42
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:35,040
If you've ever had a
piece of leather goods

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,215
that over time starts to peel

44
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:38,130
and there's white that's showing through,

45
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,668
that means that there's
actually some sort of chemical

46
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:43,100
or chromium inside the leather
that's causing it to rust.

47
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,000
Our leather won't do that.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,181
It'll get more beautiful
and patina as you use it.

49
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:49,790
You're also looking for
imperfections in the hide.

50
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,245
So tick bites, scars, open
cuts, anything like that,

51
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:56,429
just making sure at the beginning
process that you find it.

52
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:58,269
Make sure we don't use it.

53
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:00,013
The bags then go through,

54
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:03,848
and all 61 of those pieces
are cut from one hide.

55
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:06,233
You're actually getting
someone who laid out that cut

56
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:08,229
and then thought about what was

57
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,409
the piece that's going next to it

58
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,300
and then thought about the piece

59
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,700
that was going next to that.

60
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:17,240
They all get cut and
individually numbered.

61
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,590
And then we'll bring them
over to the splitter.

62
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,990
Splitting is taking the
leather and making it thinner.

63
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,681
We have different weights
for every part of the bag.

64
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,530
From the design process too,

65
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,650
it's one of those things that we spend

66
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,150
a lot of time thinking about,

67
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,080
like could this be a little bit thinner?

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,400
Could this be thicker?

69
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,907
We measure every single piece,

70
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,299
and we measure it to actually
the 10th of an ounce.

71
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:41,054
We really do pay a lot of attention

72
00:02:41,054 --> 00:02:43,323
to the weight of every piece.

73
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,854
Once everything is split, it
goes to the grinding station.

74
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:53,555
The grinding station is where
all of the pieces are shaped.

75
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:55,140
We take all of the pieces,

76
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,560
and we sand them straight.

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,740
All of those pieces are shaped and ground

78
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,817
and done by eye.

79
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,610
It's one of those things of

80
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,549
why what we do can't be automated.

81
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:08,055
From the grinding station it
moves to the painting station.

82
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,107
We have about four people painting

83
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,469
to every one person at
every other station.

84
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:16,112
Because we do fully traditional,

85
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,704
burnished and polished edges,

86
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:20,234
the painters get the ground pieces.

87
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,750
They paint a layer,

88
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,039
and they essentially raise
the grain of the leather

89
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,150
and then they bring it
over to the buffing machine

90
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,220
and then buff it.

91
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,581
And then they bring it back
to the painting station

92
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:31,650
and then they paint
another coat of edge dye

93
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,810
and then they would buff it again.

94
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,050
And you're going back and forth

95
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,204
with all 61 of those pieces
at the minimum of three times,

96
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:38,700
and some of which, eight.

97
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,669
That's why we hire artists.

98
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:41,310
They have an eye for it,

99
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,920
and they're like, this is not right yet.

100
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,223
And they will finish it until it's right.

101
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,477
So when we started this space,
this manufacturing space,

102
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:52,025
five years ago, we had three people,

103
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,077
and now we are at 22.

104
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:55,473
It's pretty rad.

105
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,464
Our team at Lotuff is 75% women.

106
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:02,333
75% of them are under the age of 35,

107
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,744
and about 70% of them
have a Bachelor's degree.

108
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:08,586
Always the biggest struggle has been

109
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:12,070
how do you find work that
you know you have a day job

110
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,800
from nine to five that can
support your life as an artist?

111
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,880
And that was always the vision
behind what we do for Lotuff.

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,706
We have furniture makers,
jewelry designers,

113
00:04:20,706 --> 00:04:22,848
print makers, illustrators, painters.

114
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:25,530
And so making a great
job they could come in,

115
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,436
work with us 30 hours a
week, get full benefits.

116
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:29,754
Health care, all of those benefits,

117
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:31,930
and then getting to do
their studio practice

118
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,292
outside of it is a really amazing thing

119
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:36,490
and we get amazing work because of that.

120
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,836
And I think it's what makes

121
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:40,323
what goes into the bag so special.

122
00:04:41,524 --> 00:04:44,758
In-between the painting phase
and the stitching phase,

123
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:48,710
there's one piece in every
bag that gets the bag number

124
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,085
and the Lotuff logo.

125
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:52,817
And so those pieces come to
the monogramming station.

126
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:56,701
We log all of the numbers in our records.

127
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:58,810
We know what pieces were going through.

128
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,660
What color it was, what style it was,

129
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,536
and what number is correlated to that.

130
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,058
Then things go to stitching.

131
00:05:04,058 --> 00:05:06,214
So all 61 of those pieces for

132
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:08,220
the Triumph will get brought over

133
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,754
and get the first level of stitching.

134
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:13,893
We use a super strong thread
that's made by a local maker.

135
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:15,830
We get all the thread dyed to match

136
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,111
each one of the leather colors.

137
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,789
For the most part, every single one of

138
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:22,260
the pieces has a specific
amount of stitches

139
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,789
that's their stitch width from
the edge is really specific.

140
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:27,686
The amount of stitches per
inch is really specific.

141
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:29,107
All of that is considered,

142
00:05:29,107 --> 00:05:31,567
and then they moved to
the turn and burn station,

143
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:34,061
which is our hand-stitching station.

144
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:36,519
So they finish the thread with
a hand-tied knot, burn it,

145
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,070
and then tuck it back into the
same hole where it came from

146
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,050
so it will actually hold and
then close the leather over it.

147
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,320
So it's locking, essentially,

148
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,060
that stitch inside of the leather.

149
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,510
The hand stitching element is something

150
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,260
that makes our bags pretty special.

151
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:53,097
After it's turned and burned,

152
00:05:53,097 --> 00:05:54,618
we'll go back to painting and buffing.

153
00:05:54,618 --> 00:05:57,957
And then it would all go to assembly.

154
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,394
Assembly station is where they are gluing

155
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,416
and assembling the bags from

156
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,910
the two-dimensional pieces
into the three-dimensional.

157
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,783
And there's different levels of that.

158
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,697
They will take all of the gussets

159
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:14,401
and all of the partitions, glue them,

160
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:16,283
and then they hammer it.

161
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,168
There's kind of a lot of back and forth

162
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:21,804
between those stations until it's done.

163
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:23,597
It goes back to grinding,

164
00:06:23,597 --> 00:06:25,023
and then back to painting,

165
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,788
and then does the full
loop all the way again,

166
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:28,538
and it does that about five times

167
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:30,173
before the bag is finished.

168
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,693
The very last thing that we
do is monogramming the bags.

169
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,010
And then we hand-write a note,

170
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,320
and then there's a card that goes in

171
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,120
every bag that has the bag number.

172
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,793
It's put in a beautiful gift box.

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,283
That's the last step before
the bag is shipped out.

174
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:55,573
It's important that
everything is made here.

175
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:57,150
It's about accountability.

176
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,362
It's accountability to our customers.

177
00:06:58,362 --> 00:07:01,399
It's making sure that we are doing things

178
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,180
the way that we say that we're doing it

179
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,810
and watching every step of the way.

180
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,130
And we really couldn't do that
if we weren't making it here

181
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,470
and making it ourselves,

182
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,941
and we can really say that
we look at every single piece

183
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:13,954
and make sure that it's perfect
before it goes out the door.

184
00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:16,337
We're not just a marketing company,

185
00:07:16,337 --> 00:00:00,000
but we're actually, we're a maker company.
