PETE: HOUR BEFORE THE MAY
JOBS REPORT CAME OUT
YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT
TWEETED HE WAS EXCITED TO
SEE THE NUMBERS.
THE REPORT WAS EXCELLENT.
AN 18-YEAR LOW IN THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.
BUT THE MEDIA MADE IT ALL
ABOUT THAT TWEET.
LISTEN.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE
SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS ABOUT
WHY THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO
TWEET ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND.
WHY WOULD THE PRESIDENT TELL
ALL OF AMERICA TO LOOK AT
THE JOBS NUMBERS IF THE JOBS
NUMBERS WERE NOT GOOD?
>> HE WAS SO EAGER TO
TRUMPET THE NEWS HE BROKE
YEARS OF PRESIDENTIAL
PROTOCOL.
>> INSIDER TRADING YOU CAN
GET THE CHEAT SHEET INSIDE
THE PRESIDENT.
FIRST TIME THE PRESIDENT HAS
BROKEN THE RULES WHEN IT
COMES TO SHARING SENSITIVE,
SOMETIMES EVEN CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION.
ABBY: HE BROKE THE RULES.
THE HOST OF VARNEY AND
COHOST
CO,OST
CO,HOT
CO,HOST OF VARNEY AND COMPANY.
ABBY: WANT JOBS NUMBERS
WANTS YOU TO KNOW ABOUT.
>> THE MEDIA WANTS YOU TO BE
DISTRACTED FROM THE VERY
GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE ECONOMY.
WE GOT THAT GREAT NEWS AT
8:30 YESTERDAY.
NO MATTER WHAT THE PRESIDENT
HINTED BEFORE HAND.
IT WAS GREAT NEWS.
THE MEDIA JUST WANTED TO
DISTRACT ANDY VERT ATTENTION
AWAY FROM THE NEWS ON JOBS.
PETE: INSIDER TRADING,
STUART.
>> STOP IT.
COME ON, SON.
GET OUT OF HERE.
ED: THERE IS PROTOCOL YOU
ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BREAK IT
WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.
>> DID HE BREAK IT?
HE HINTED IT MIGHT BE OKAY.
HE GOT THE NEWS BEFORE HAND.
ED: THE WHITE HOUSE ALWAYS
GETS IT THE NIGHT BEFORE.
>> THAT IS NOT THE STORY.
LOOK AT THIS.
THE STORY IS 3.8%
UNEMPLOYMENT.
LOWEST IN A GENERATION.
YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT IN
THIS GENERATION.
3.8%.
5.9%.
THAT'S THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
FOR BLACK FOLKS THAT SAN
ALL-TIME LOW.
IT'S NEVER BEEN DOWN AT THAT
LEVEL BEFORE.
SAME STORY FOR HISPANICS.
223 NEW THOUSAND JOBS
CREATED.
YOU ARE ON THE ROAD TO
PROSPERITY.
ED: NOT ACCORDING TO NANCY
PELOSI.
NANCY PELOSI SAID LOOK AT
THIS, MAY'S JOB REPORT SHOWS
THAT STRONG EMPLOYMENT
NUMBERS MEAN LITTLE TO THE
FAMILIES HIT WITH SOARING
NEW COSTS UNDER THE
REPUBLICAN'S WATCH.
FIRST SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT
CRUMBS WITH THE TAX CUT.
NOW SHE IS SAYING THESE
NUMBERS DON'T HELP.
ABBY: IS THAT INSULTING?
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
INSULTING.
BUT IT'S A MESSAGE OF
DESPERATION.
THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT HAVE A
GROWTH PLAN.
THEY DON'T HAVE ONE.
SO THEY HAVE TO CRITICIZE
THE PRESIDENT'S GROWTH PLAN
BECAUSE IT IS WORKING.
AND IT IS WORKING.
YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT CAME
TO OFFICE SAYING I'M GOING
TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
AND THE KEYSTONE TO THAT
WHOLE OPERATION WAS
DEREGULATE AND LOWER TAXES.
HE DID BOTH.
AND NOW WE'RE SEEING THE
FRUITS OF THAT.
ABBY: WHAT IS SHE REFERRING
TO THERE IN THAT COMMENT
WHEN SHE SAID IT'S GOING UP
FOR SOME FAMILIES.
>> YOU COULD MAKE THE
ARGUMENT GASOLINE PRICES ARE
UP A LITTLE.
THAT IS TRUE.
YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT
MORTGAGE RATES ARE UP A
LITTLE.
THAT IS ACCURATE.
SHE COULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT
THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE
RISING.
THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THAT IS BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE
LINGERS ON IN OUR ECONOMY.
PETE: SO SHE IS LOOKING FOR
THE LEMONS IN THE LEMONADE
WHICH OF COURSE SHE WOULD DO
BEING IN THE MINORITY.
THEY DO HAVE A GROWTH PLAN.
IT'S A GOVERNMENT GROWTH
PLAN.
HER VIEW IS YOU SOLVE THESE
PROBLEMS BY GROWING
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS FOR
PEOPLE.
>> STOP IT, PETER.
PETE: IT A GROWTH PLAN.
>> THAT GROWTH PLAN IS TAX
AND SPEND.
PETE: OF COURSE.
>> IT DOES NOT PRODUCE
GROWTH.
IT PRODUCES VIRTUALLY NO
GROWTH FOR A LONG PERIOD OF
TIME.
THE BEST WE GOT IN THE EIGHT
YEARS OF TAX AND SPEND OBAMA
YEARS, WAS 2%.
THAT'S ALL WE GOT.
WE HAVE NOW HAD 15 MONTH OF
THE TRUMP ECONOMY AND WE
HAVE 3% GROWTH.
I THINK WE HAVE A VERY GOOD
SHOT AT GOING TO 4% GROWTH
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.
ON TARGET.
ABBY: I WAS LOOKING AT
NUMBERS LAST NIGHT TO
COMPARE WHERE WE'RE.
YOU FORGET OCTOBER OF
200910% UNEMPLOYMENT.
HOW FAR WE HAVE COME.
>> WE HAVE COME A VERY, LONG
WAY.
ESPECIALLY THE LAST 15, 16
MONTHS OF THE TRUMP'S
PRESIDENCY.
WE ARE ON THE ROAD TO
PROSPERITY.
THE DEMOCRATS CANNOT ADMIT
