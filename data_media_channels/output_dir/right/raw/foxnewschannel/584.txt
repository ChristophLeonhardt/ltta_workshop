1
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,250
BRIAN: THANK YOU FOR THAT.

2
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:11,118
MAXINE WATERS TURNS 80 YEARS

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:11,419
YOUNG.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,253
CALIFORNIA LIBERAL REVEALING

5
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:13,654
WHAT SHE WANTS FOR HER

6
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:14,488
BIRTHDAY MORE THAN ANYTHING

7
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:14,789
ELSE.

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,656
I WILL STOP NOW.

9
00:00:15,657 --> 00:00:18,826
>> MY BIGGEST BIRTHDAY WISH

10
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:20,428
WOULD BE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO

11
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:23,431
GET A LEADER OF THIS COUNTRY

12
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:26,100
WHO REPRESENTS US, WHO HAS

13
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:28,236
THE RESPECT OF ALL OF OUR

14
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,303
ALLIES ALL OVER THE WORLD.

15
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:30,938
SOMEONE WHO HAS AN

16
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:32,807
APPRECIATION FOR THE

17
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:33,975
CONSTITUTION, SOMEONE THAT

18
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:36,277
DOES NOT LIE.

19
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:37,979
STEVE: WELL, FOX NEWS

20
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,579
CONTRIBUTOR TOMI LAHREN

21
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,847
JOINS US NOW FROM OUT ON THE

22
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:40,815
WEST COAST.

23
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:44,318
TOMI, I THINK HE

24
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:44,352
TOMI, I THINK SE

25
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:45,152
TOMI, I THINK SHE IS TALKING

26
00:00:45,153 --> 00:00:46,420
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND AS WE

27
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,355
HAVE LEARNED IN THE LAST

28
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:48,256
YEAR SHE DOESN'T LIKE HIM.

29
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,657
>> WELL, I WAS HOPING SHE

30
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:50,958
WAS TALKING ABOUT HERSELF

31
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:57,231
APPRECIATION FOR THE

32
00:00:57,232 --> 00:00:58,165
CONSTITUTION.

33
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:01,569
BUT, LISTEN, IF AND WHEN

34
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,770
TRUMP DE RANGEMENT SYNDROME

35
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,306
IS PUT IN THE DICTIONARY

36
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:08,442
THERE WILL BE A PHOTO OF

37
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,343
MAXINE WATERS NEXT THOUGH

38
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:09,944
THAT DESCRIPTION.

39
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:15,716
THE REASON SHE IS TALKING

40
00:01:15,717 --> 00:01:17,785
ABOUT THE REMOVE OF

41
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:22,223
FOR HER CONSTITUENTS, FOR

42
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:22,623
CALIFORNIA.

43
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,958
SHE SIMPLY HAS TO BE

44
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,159
ANTI-TRUMP BECAUSE THAT IS

45
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,260
HER SCHTICK AND SHE HAS

46
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:29,196
NOTHING ELSE TO SAY.

47
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:34,769
>> WELL, WELCOME TO

48
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,169
CALIFORNIA.

49
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,270
I MEAN, THERE IS A LOT OF

50
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:37,738
THINGS WE NEED TO FIX IN

51
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,607
THIS STATE AND I'M HOPING

52
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:40,675
WHEN WE HAVE ELECTIONS ROLL

53
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:42,243
AROUND WE CAN START TO FIX

54
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:43,344
THOSE THINGS LITTLE BY

55
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:43,678
LITTLE.

56
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:45,680
IT'S GOING TO BE AN UPHILL

57
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:46,814
BATTLE AS I KNOW FROM LIVING

58
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,281
IN CALIFORNIA.

59
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:48,416
I THINK THE MORE THAT SHE

60
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,153
REMOVING DONALD TRUMP, JUST

61
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,921
BEING OVERALL ANTI-TRUMP, I

62
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:54,622
THINK THEY ARE GOING TO

63
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:55,890
START TO LOSE SUPPORT.

64
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:57,591
BECAUSE EVEN THOSE WHO DON'T

65
00:01:57,592 --> 00:01:58,326
LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP STILL

66
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,361
WANT TO HEAR POLICY ITEMS

67
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:01,996
AND AGENDA ITEMS TO BETTER

68
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,197
THIS COUNTRY, BETTER THE

69
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:05,299
DISTRICT AND IF SHE IS JUST

70
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,167
SIMPLY ANTI-TRUMP, I DON'T

71
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,435
KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HOLD

72
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:10,303
YOU THAT.

73
00:02:10,305 --> 00:02:11,806
DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO

74
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:12,139
WORK?

75
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,342
IT'S JUST RESIST, RESIST,

76
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:14,675
RESIST.

77
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,443
DON'T PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR

78
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:15,876
ABOUT POLICY.

79
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:16,977
>> I BELIEVE THAT THEY DO.

80
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,179
OF COURSE, THERE ARE SOME

81
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,246
AREAS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE

82
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:21,115
THE RESIST MESSAGE IS VERY

83
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:21,449
POPULAR.

84
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,950
I SEE IT ON A DAILY BASIS.

85
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:24,251
BUT, LIKE I HAVE TOLD YOU

86
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:25,486
GUYS SOME TIMES JUST FROM

87
00:02:25,487 --> 00:02:26,220
LIVING IN CALIFORNIA FOR

88
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,389
ABOUT A YEAR NOW, CAN I SEE

89
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,223
THINGS STARTING TO CHANGE.

90
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:30,791
CAN I SEE INDIVIDUALS TIRED

91
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,460
OF THE HOMELESSNESS, TIRED

92
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:35,963
THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO

93
00:02:35,964 --> 00:02:37,698
HAVE TO PUT MORE PRESSURE ON

94
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,699
OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO BE

95
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,401
MORE THAN JUST ANTI-TRUMP.

96
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:44,238
STARTING WITH CRAZY MAXINE

97
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:44,638
WATERS.

98
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,475
OF THE HIGH TAXES I IMAGINE.

99
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:48,809
LET'S TALK ABOUT MILLENNIAL

100
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,110
WOMEN.

101
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,679
THEY HAVE A DEFINITE FEELING

102
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:58,119
THE MOST DEMOCRAT FEMALES

103
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,887
OVER THE NEXT GENERATION,

104
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,189
63% SAY THEY ARE FEMINIST.

105
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,358
A TOTAL OF 46% OVERALL WHEN

106
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:05,426
YOU FACTOR IN INDEPENDENTS

107
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:07,194
AND REPUBLICANS.

108
00:03:07,195 --> 00:03:09,630
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

109
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:11,232
>> WELL, THIS ISN'T

110
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,900
SURPRISING TO ME BECAUSE I

111
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,468
KNOW MANY MILLENNIAL WOMEN

112
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:16,470
WHO THOUGH THEY BELIEVE IN

113
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:17,905
FEMALE EMPOWERMENT AND

114
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:22,676
ANYMORE.

115
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:25,379
MODERN DAY THEM NISTS

116
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:29,650
HORRIFIED ABOUT AND ROLL IN

117
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,218
THEIR GRAVES WHAT THE

118
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:31,886
FEMINISTS HAVE DONE ABOUT

119
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:32,620
THE MOVEMENT.

120
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:36,457
SPECIAL TREATMENT.

121
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:39,960
THE STREETS GETTING

122
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:41,429
ATTENTION WITH HATS AND

123
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,329
BEING ANTI-TRUMP.

124
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,764
IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT

125
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,599
LIFTING UP WOMEN.

126
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,100
EMPOWERING WOMEN.

127
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,334
IF THEY WERE TO DO THAT THEY

128
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:48,636
WOULD HAVE TO EMPOWER WOMEN

129
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:49,570
WHO ARE CONSERVATIVE WOMEN

130
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:51,372
AND AS WE HAVE SEEN

131
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:52,573
ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST SIX

132
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:53,240
MONTHS THEY HAVE DONE

133
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:55,209
EVERYTHING BUT THAT THE

134
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,777
FEMINISTS HAVE NOT COME OUT

135
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,345
TO SUPPORT PEOPLE LIKE SARAH

136
00:03:58,346 --> 00:03:59,947
HUCKABEE SANDERS, LIKE

137
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:00,614
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN LIKE THE

138
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,482
REST OF THE WOMEN IN THE

139
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:02,183
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHO

140
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:03,651
HAVE ASCENDED TO VERY HIGH

141
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:04,518
POSITIONS UNDER THIS

142
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:04,985
PRESIDENT.

143
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:06,554
ALL THEY HAVE DONE IS DEMEAN

144
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:07,421
THESE WOMEN.

145
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:08,789
SO THAT'S WHY I THINK WE ARE

146
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,191
SEEING A LOT OF MILLENNIAL

147
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:11,625
WOMEN SAY YOU KNOW WHAT?

148
00:04:13,495 --> 00:00:00,000
STEVE: THAT'S FROM A BRAND
