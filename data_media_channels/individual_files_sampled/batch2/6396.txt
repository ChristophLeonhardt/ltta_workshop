APPLE IS APOLOGIZING AFTER CONFESSED TO SLOWING DOWN OLDER PHONES AFTER THEY UPDATE WITH NEW SOFTWARE. APPLE SAYS THEY DON'T DO THIS INTENTIONALLY SO YOU ARE FORCED TO BUY A NEW PHONE, THEY SAY THEY DO IT IN ORDER FOR AN OLD BATTERY TO BE ABLE TO POWER THE PROCESSOR. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE. I AM NOT A TECHNOLOGY PERSON. REALLY, I COULDN'T TELL? LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXPERT'S REPORTING. SO BASICALLY IF YOU HAVE AN OLD PHONE IT WILL HAVE AN OLDER BATTERY IN THAT OLDER BATTERY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE NEW SOFTWARE. THE IDEA IS IT KIND OF SLOWS DOWN SOME OF THE FEATURES OF THE PHONE IN ORDER FOR THE BATTERY TO KEEP UP. PEOPLE WERE IRRITATED TO SAY THE LEAST BECAUSE EVERYONE SUSPECTED THAT AFTER YOU UPDATE THE NEW SOFTWARE IT WILL SLOW DOWN AND SO SINCE SO MANY PEOPLE WERE UPSET AND SINCE SO MANY LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED APPLE SAYS THAT BATTERIES ARE CONSUMABLE COMPONENTS – NO. NOT GOOD ENOUGH. THEY ARE ALSO GOING TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT MOVING FORWARD. THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS PEOPLE HAD. PEOPLE SAID BE TRANSPARENT WITH THE CONSUMER. THEY SAY BEGINNING IN 2018 THEY WILL. MY MAIN QUESTION IS DO YOU BELIEVE THEM? DO YOU BELIEVE THEY ARE PLAYING DOWN WITH SLOWING DOWN YOUR PHONE JUST SO THAT IT WILL SAVE ENOUGH ENERGY SO YOUR PHONE FUNCTIONS BETTER? OR SLOWING IT DOWN SO YOU WILL BY ANYONE? I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL LIKE A CLOWN GIVING YOU ANY TYPE OF SPECULATION. WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT IF I GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND THEY ARE BEING HONEST THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY REALLY DOES IRRITATE ME AS WELL. I WAS FORCED TO GO OUT AND BUY A NEW PHONE. IF I HAD KNOWN ALL HAVE TO DO IS REPLACE THE BATTERY, THEN I WOULD'VE DONE THAT INSTEAD OF PURCHASING THIS IPHONE 10 SITUATION THAT I DESPISE. I HATE IT. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A WHILE AGO, THERE WAS THIS ONLINE ANIMATED SERIES CALLED – SHE INTRODUCED THIS TERM TO ME, OBSOLESCENCE. THESE COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY BUILT IN PROGRAMMING AND PARTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO EITHER DESTROY THEMSELVES OR NOT FUNCTION SUSTAINABLY FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT WE CAN REPLACE IT WITH THEIR NEW PRODUCT SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUOUSLY PUT PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET. IT SOUNDS THE WAY SHE DESCRIBED PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE. BUT AGAIN I AM NOT A TECH PERSON. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TRULY BEING HONEST ABOUT THESE OPTIMIZATION APPROACHES TO MAKE THE NEW PHONES RUN FASTER AT THE MERCY OF THE OLDER PHONES. BUT LIKE YOU I AM FRUSTRATED THAT THIS HAS TO COME OUT THROUGH A THIRD PARTY REVEALING THIS ABOUT APPLE AND APPLE NOT COMING FORWARD AND SAYING THAT'S WHAT OUR PHONES HAVE SLOWED DOWN, YOU HAVE FELT IT. LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF RESOLUTION FOR PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AS CUSTOMERS. I KNOW APPLE IS A COMPANY THAT WANTS TO REMAIN PROFITABLE AND I RESPECTED. EVEN WITH THEIR TRANSPARENCY THEY WILL REMAIN PROFITABLE BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT THERE ARE APPLE FANATICS ARE WILLING TO WAIT IN A LINE THAT IS FIVE HOURS LONG JUST TO GET THE NEWEST IPHONE. I DON'T GET IT, I JUST WANT TO KEEP MY OLD PHONE AS LONG AS I CAN. BUT OUR PHONES ARE NOW MORE THAN JUST PHONES. OUR ENTIRE LIVES ARE ON THIS DEVICE. I HAD TO GO TO A WORK-RELATED TRIP ON THE EAST COAST WHEN I STILL HAD MY IPHONE SIX AND IT JUST KEPT SHUTTING DOWN. I WOULD HAVE 40% BATTERY AND IT WOULD SHUT DOWN. THEN I COULDN'T CHARGE IT. I AM NOT IN MY HOMETOWN AND NOWHERE NEAR HOME. I AM TRAVELING, MY PHONE IS NOT WORKING, I HAVE ALL THE DATA I NEED TO MAKE THIS TRAVEL SITUATION RUN SMOOTHLY AND MY PHONE IS SHUTTING DOWN. THE TRANSPARENCY IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME. THAT IS ME TALKING ABOUT A PRIVILEGED PERSON WHO CAN AFFORD TO GO OUT AND BUY A NEW PHONE. WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO CAN'T? THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS? ALL THIS – YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY PERSON, THERE WAS A CIRCLE OF PEOPLE AROUND ME WHO WERE EXPRESSING THEIR FRUSTRATION. IS THIS COLLECTIVE DETRACTION FROM APPLE BEING A COMPELLING PRODUCT. THEY ARE LOSING CUSTOMERS AND POTENTIAL PROFITS BY NOT SATISFYING YOU GUYS. THANKFULLY I GOT THE PHONE BEFORE THIS WHOLE SHUTDOWN SITUATION HAPPENED. I SAW TONS OF PEOPLE EXPRESSING OUTRAGE OVER HAVING TO DEAL WITH A NON-FUNCTIONING PHONE. I LIKE APPLE. I HAVE AN IPHONE. BUT I AM WITH YOU, LUCKILY FOR US I AM A TECH EXPERT. WRONG AGAIN. HERE IS THE OVERALL THING, THEY TELL US THE HARDWARE, YOU HAVE TO KEEP BUYING NEW ONES. WE HAVE ALL THESE ENGINEERS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SOFTWARE THAT YOU ARE HOOKED ON, YOU HAVE YOUR MUSIC ON ITUNES, THAT IS SOLID AS A ROCK. SO WHATEVER IS IN THE CLOUD OR THE INFORMATION ATTACHED TO YOUR PHONE, THAT WORKS PERFECTLY BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAS YOU HOOKED. IF YOU MOVE TO A KIND OF PHONE, YOU HAVE TO GET ALL THE NEW NUMBERS, YOU HAVE TO GET NEW MUSIC. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE HARDWARE, OH DIDN'T SLOW DOWN? WHAT AN UNLUCKY BREAK. AND SO I HAVE THIS GUT INSTINCT WHICH A LOT OF YOU DID, EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A TECH EXPERT. I DID THE UPDATES THAT EVERYBODY WAS TELLING ME TO DO, BUT THE UPDATES WERE PART OF THE PROBLEM. IT HAS SECURITY FEATURES. THAT IS ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT APPLE PRODUCTS. I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND SAY THEY ARE NOT TRACKABLE, BUT THEIR SECURITY UPDATES ARE IMPORTANT. I KNOW. AND I JUST DID IT. NOW I HAVE TO GO BUY A NEW BATTERY BUT I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE END OF JANUARY. THEY ARE CHOOSING NOT TO FIX IT. I HAD THE SAME KIND OF EPIPHANY YOU DID WHEN I READ THE STORY ABOUT THE AIRLINES AND HOW THEY HAVE CALCULATED MISERY? THAT SOUNDS SO MUCH WORSE. TO MAKE YOU MORE MISERABLE UNTIL YOU WANT TO GET ON THE PLANE FIRST AND THEN YOU NEED TO GET ON THE PLANE FIRST. AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT I WAS FEELING IN MY GUT. AND IT IS NOT JUST APPLE, ALL THESE GUYS ARE DOING IT TO MAKE MORE MONEY. WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT THE OFFICE PATIENT ABOUT IT AND ALL OF HER FRUSTRATIONS, OVERALL AT SOME POINT IT WILL BE A BAD LONG-TERM STRATEGY BECAUSE OUR BATTERIES WILL START TO RUN OUT.
