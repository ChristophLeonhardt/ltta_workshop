00:00:02,815 --> 00:00:05,050
SENATOR GRAHAM.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,987
>> ARE YOU AWARE THAT AT 9:23 ON

4
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:11,957
THE NIGHT OF JULY 9, THE DAY YOU

HAVE.

12
00:00:24,904 --> 00:00:26,805
I HOPE I HAVE A BIPARTISAN

13
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:28,007
MAJORITY WILL DO THE SAME.

14
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:30,109
THE STAKES ARE SIMPLY TOO HIGH

15
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:30,876
FOR ANYTHING LESS.

16
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:32,344
IF YOU WEREN'T AWARE OF IT, YOU

17
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:32,845
ARE NOW.

18
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:35,414
DID YOU MEET WITH SENATOR DIANNE

19
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:36,682

>> DID YOU KNOW THAT HER STAFF

23
00:00:41,087 --> 00:00:42,488
ALREADY RECOMMENDED A LAWYER TO

24
00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:42,955
DR. FORD?

25
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:44,490
>> I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

26
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,760
>> DID YOU KNOW THAT HER AND HER

27
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,662
STAFF HAD THIS ALLEGATIONS FOR

28
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:50,696
OVER 20 DAYS?

00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:52,698
>> I DID NOT KNOW THAT AT THE

30
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:52,998
TIME.

31
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:55,568
>> IF YOU WANTED AN FBI

32
00:00:55,568 --> 00:00:56,302
INVESTIGATION YOU COULD HAVE

33
00:00:56,302 --> 00:00:57,069
COME TO US.

34
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:00,206
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS DESTROY

35
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:05,945
THIS GUY'S LIFE, HOLD THIS SEAT

36
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:07,713
HOPE AND HOPE YOU WIN IN 2020.

37
00:01:07,713 --> 00:01:08,447
NOT ME.

38
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:10,850
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE

39
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,284
FOR.

40
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:15,087
WHEN YOU SEE SOTOMAYOR AND KAGAN

41
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:16,255
THAT LINDSEY SAID HELLO.

42
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:17,456
I VOTED FOR THEM.

43
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:18,824
I WOULD NEVER DO TO THIS WHAT

44
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:21,894
YOU HAVE DONE TO THIS GUY.

45
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:25,464
IN IS THE MOST UNETHICAL SCAM

46
00:01:25,464 --> 00:01:26,932
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS.

47
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:30,703
IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO KNOW THE

48
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:32,471
TRUTH, YOU SURE AS HELL WOULDN'T

49
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:33,840
HAVE DONE WHAT YOU DID TO THIS

50
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,108
GUY.

51
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:38,544
ARE YOU A GANG RAPIST?

52
00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:39,812
>> NO.

53
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:41,814
>> I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT YOU AND

54
00:01:41,814 --> 00:01:43,583
YOUR FAMILY HAVE GONE THROUGH.

55
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,784
BOY, YA'LL WANT POWER.

56
00:01:44,784 --> 00:01:46,719
GOD I HOPE YOU NEVER GOT IT.

57
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,588
I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN

58
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:49,589
SEE THROUGH THIS SHAM.

59
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:51,624
THAT YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND YOU

60
00:01:51,624 --> 00:01:52,125
HELD IT.

61
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,028
YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF

62
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:55,895
PROTECTING DR. FORD.

63
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:56,195
NONE.

64
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:59,832
SHE'S AS MUCH OF A VICTIM AS YOU

65
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:00,166
ARE.

66
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,168
GOD I HATE TO SAY IT BECAUSE

67
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:03,269
THESE HAVE BEEN MY FRIENDS.

68
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:05,905
LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN IT COMES

69
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:07,907
TO THIS, YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A

70
00:02:07,907 --> 00:02:09,508
FAIR PROCESS?

71
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,245
YOU CAME TO THE WRONG TOWN AT

72
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:13,946
THE WRONG TIME, MY FRIEND.

73
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:17,183
YOU CONSIDER THIS A JOB

74
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:17,817
INTERVIEW?

75
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:19,919
>> THE ADVICE AN CONSENT ROLE --

76
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,587
>> DO YOU CONSIDER THAT YOU'VE

77
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:23,956
BEEN THROUGH A JOB INTERVIEW?

78
00:02:23,956 --> 00:02:26,225
>> I'VE BEEN THROUGH A PROCESS

79
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:27,226
OF ADVICE --

80
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:30,029
>> WOULD YOU SAY YOU'VE BEEN

81
00:02:30,029 --> 00:02:30,697
THROUGH HELL?

82
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:31,964
>> I'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL AND

83
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:32,465
THEN SOME.

84
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:34,500
>> THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW.

85
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,703
>> YEAH.

86
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,871
>> THIS IS HELL.

87
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:40,707
THIS IS GOING TO DESTROY THE

88
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:43,843
ABILITY OF GOOD PEOPLE TO COME

89
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:47,213
FORWARD BECAUSE OF THIS CRAP.

90
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:48,915
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEAR BOOK.

91
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:50,950
YOU HAVE INTERACTED WITH

92
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,951
PROFESSIONAL WOMEN ALL YOUR

93
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:54,087
LIFE, NOT ONE ACCUSATION.

94
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:56,489
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BILL COSBY

95
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,925
WHEN YOU'RE A JUNIOR AND SENIOR

96
00:02:58,925 --> 00:02:59,592
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

97
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:04,998
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GOT OVER IT.

98
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:06,866
IT'S BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

99
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,401
IF YOU DRUG WOMEN AND RAPE THEM

100
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:10,970
FOR TWO YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

101
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,839
YOU PROBABLY DON'T STOP.

102
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:15,008
HERE'S MY UNDERSTANDING.

103
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:17,510
IF YOU LIVED A GOOD LIFE, PEOPLE

104
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,646
WILL RECOGNIZE IT LIKE THE

105
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:21,948
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION HAS THE

106
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:22,782
GOAL STANDARD.

107
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:27,787
HIS INTEGRITY IS ABSOLUTELY

108
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:29,489
UNQUESTIONED, HE'S A VERY

109
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,125
CIRCUMSPECT IN HIS PERSONAL

110
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:36,696
CONDUCT, HARBORS NO BIASES OR

111
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:39,599
PREJUDICES, A DECENT PERSONAL,

112
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,669
WARM, FRIENDLY, THE NICEST

113
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,004
PERSON IN THE ABA.

114
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,606
ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU, YOU

115
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:48,742
SHOULD BE PROUD OF, ASHLEY, YOU

116
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:50,844
SHOULD BE PROUD OF THIS.

117
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:53,346
THAT YOU RAISED A DAUGHTER THAT

118
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:56,049
HAD THE GOOD CHARACTER TO PRAY

119
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:57,083
FOR DR. FORD.

120
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,387
TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IF

121
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:03,323
YOU VOTE NO, YOU'RE LEGITIMIZING

122
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:05,692
THE MOST DESPICABLE THING I HAVE

123
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:08,996
SEEN IN MY TIME IN POLITICS.

124
00:04:08,996 --> 00:04:10,364
YOU WANT THIS SEAT?

125
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:12,299
I HOPE YOU NEVER GET IT.

126
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,368
I HOPE YOU'RE ON THE SUPREME

127
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:14,835
COURT.

128
00:04:14,835 --> 00:04:16,236
THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE YOU SHOULD

129
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:16,670
BE.

130
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,172
AND I HOPE THAT THE AMERICAN

131
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:22,376
PEOPLE WILL SEE THROUGH THIS

132
00:04:22,376 --> 00:00:00,000
CHARADE.
