COULD HANDLE INSTANCES OF CHEATING. BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF HIS RECOMMENDATION ABOUT WHETHER TO STAY IN THE DEAL OR NOT. Neil: THANKS. IF IT COMES DOWN TO IT, WE CAN TRUST THESE GUYS, THE IRANIANS, HOW CAN WE DEAL WITH THIS GUY? THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA. RETIRED GENERAL RICHARD NEWTON. GOOD TO HAVE YOU. WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE PROOF THAT THE ISRAELIS HAVE THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE BEEN CHEATING. AT FACE VALUE, DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE? WELL, GOOD AFTERNOON, NEIL. PROOF WILL BE IN THE PUDDING IN WHAT THE INTELLIGENCE PANS OUT. I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IT. SECRETARY MATTIS DIDN'T GET OUT IN FRONT OF WHAT HE'S SEEN OR NOT SOON. I'LL TELL YOU THIS, YOU CANNOT TRUST IRAN. THEY'RE THE LARGEST EXPORTER OF TERRORISM. THEY'RE NOT TO BE TRUSTED. IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME THAT PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU HAS THE EVIDENCE. IN MY VIEW, I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE, I DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD DEAL. I'M WITH. TRUMP ON THIS. BUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS WILL PERSUADE HIM TO REIMPOSE SANCTIONS ON MAY 12th IS TO BE DETERMINED. IT DOES ADD TO OUR FAST PACED NOT ONLY WITH IRAN DEAL, ALSO WHAT IS FORTH COMING IN NORTH KOREA. AND WHATEVER DEAL THAT WE ENTER WITH THE NORTH KOREANS CAN BE VERIFIED. ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S WHERE NOT ONLY THE DIPLOMATS HAVE TO TAKE OVER BUT GETS DOWN TO THE MAKEUP OF THE WEAPONS INSPECTORS. MAYBE THROUGH U.N. AND SO FORTH. I'VE ALWAYS HAD SKEPTICISM REGARDING THIS AGREEMENT WITH IRAN, WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ENOUGH TEETH IN IT TO ALLOW THE WEAPONS INSPECTORS TO REALLY DO THEIR JOB. LET'S ALSO REMEMBER, THIS IS NOT THE IRAN DEAL IS NOT A TREATY. IT'S A BINDING DOCUMENTS. IT'S AN AGREEMENT. SO THAT HAS SOME ISSUES. ALSO THE FACT THAT IT HAS A SUNSET CLAUSE IN THE NEXT 10 OR 15 YEARS WHERE IRAN COULD BREAK OUT OF THE DEAL SHOULD IT BE MOVING FORWARD. AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS HANDS FULL WITH THIS ONE, PARTICULARLY WITH PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU COMING FORWARD WITH HIS ED. HE'S COMING ON THE HEELS OF A SUCCESSFUL VISIT WITH FRENCH PRESIDENT MACRON. SECRETARY POMPEO JUST CAME OUT OF NATO IN BRUSSELS A COUPLE DAYS OR SO AGO. SO IT'S A LOT OF WAIT TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN. THE PRESIDENT HAS A MAJOR DECISION TO MAKE. YOU'RE RIGHT. THE OTHER THOUGHT IS, THE NORTH KOREANS AND THE IRANIANS HAVE BEEN JOINED AT THE HIP ON A VARIETY OF THINGS. IT WILL COME UP WHEN THE NEGOTIATIONS BEGIN WITH THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER. I'M WONDERING SINCE OBVIOUSLY VERIFICATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN LACKING IN IRAN, HOW DO WE TIGHTEN IT IN THE CASE OF NORTH KOREA? THERE'S THIS RONALD REAGAN DEAL, TRUST AND VERIFY. WE'LL HAVE TO DO THAT. ALMOST GO TO SCHOOL ON THE IRAN DEAL AND MAKE IT AS INTRUSIVE AS WE CAN WITH NORTH KOREA. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT THE MOMENT PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU'S EVIDENCE WITH THE IRAN DEAL. NORTH KOREA IS WATCHING THIS AS WELL. HOW HARD AND HOW STRONG WE STAND IN THE SADDLE WILL ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT IN TERMS OF HOW EFFECTIVELY WE ARE TO BE ABLE TO AGAIN SADDLE NORTH KOREA. Neil: I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. YOU MAKE SO MANY POINTS. ONE IS THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN LET'S SAY WE SHELF THE DEAL WITH THE IRANIANS. COULD THAT HURT US IN NEGOTIATING ONE WITH THE NORTH KOREANS SAYING THE UNITED STATES JUST BACKED AWAY, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T GO INTO THIS. IF WE BACK AWAY FROM THIS, IT'S BASED ON U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS AND WHAT ARE THE BEST INTERESTS FOR OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION AS WELL. I THINK OPPOSITE OF THAT. NORTH KOREA WOULD PROBABLY TAKE NOTE OF THE FACT THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW WITH SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO AND SECRETARY MATTIS WON'T PUT UP WITH THINGS THAT ARE NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES. NOT ONLY SHORT TERM BUT LONG-TERM AS WELL. I THINK KIM WOULD PROBABLY NOT WOULD TAKE NOTE OF THAT LEADING INTO WHAT THESE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM GOING TO
