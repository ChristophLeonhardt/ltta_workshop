so here's a tidbit of information you may not know about the origin of the phrase conspiracy theory according to investigative journalist Cheryl åkesson you remember her she's the journalist who had to leave CBS because they wouldn't let her run stories that reflected badly on President Barack Obama even though she'd run plenty of stories that reflected badly on George HW Bush but anyway and that consumes books smear she talks about the fact that the phrase conspiracy theory was invented by the CIA in 1967 as a way to discredit people who suspected the CIA of conspiracies the spy agency was apparently responsible for promoting the phrase conspiracy theory for use as a powerful device in the lexicon of the smear artists åkesson writes before the covert CIA effort which we can pinpoint to a secret memo in 1967 there was nothing controversial about discussing or exposing conspiracies after all a conspiracy is simply an agreement by two or more people to commit a bad act åkesson goes on yet after the CIA secret memo the public and media were brainwashed into dismissing out of hand those labeled as conspiracy theorists as if only the mentally unbalanced would believe in the existence of conspiracies conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization reads the internal CIA memo the aim of this memo is to provide material for countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists the CIA memo goes on to advise station chiefs to employ propaganda assets friendly journalists and others to use certain Turk talking points for instance see if these talking points sound familiar argue that this conspiracy is nothing new insist that a large-scale conspiracy would be impossible to conceal in the United States smear critics as politically or financially motivated hasty and inaccurate were infatuated with their own theories now yesterday Andrew McCabe had to leave this FBI more suddenly than he planned mccabe now joins James Comey Peter struck Lisa Paige James Baker and Jim Rebecca is FBI employees who were involved in the investigation of Hillary Clinton's secret email server and have since left or been real signed under a cloud of suspicion this doesn't necessarily prove that the Clinton investigation was mishandled or that the FBI is involved in a more tangled web of anti-republican activity but we do know this the lack of journalistic curiosity about the behavior of our government during the Barack Obama administration was an invitation to exactly that kind of government corruption just as a reminder here's a montage of our journalistic watchdogs asking President Obama the tough questions during his time in office a lot of parallels have been offered between yourself and John F Kennedy who also made history came in with a young attractive family had a lot of big Harvard brains around him when was the first moment that it began to sink in that you were president did you have a chuckle that you just couldn't get rid of something weird did happen it was so crazy that you just went to bed laughing about how confident are you that your plan is going to work and how do you avoid the dangers of being too cocky you've racked up a lot of wins in the last few weeks that a lot of people thought would be difficult to come by are you ready to call yourself the comeback kid you know you are the equivalent of a rock star in politics do you feel sometimes like your administration is not given the credit it deserves where do you get all this confidence how does this feel of all the honors that have come your way during these first 100 days what has surprised you the most about this office enchanted you the most serving in this office that was then but now yesterday soon after McCabe's resignation the House Intelligence Committee voted on party lines to replete to release a Republican authored memo on possible FISA abuses that the Justice Department will talk about that throughout the show here's one reaction from the press it's a representative reaction and remember this is a press who has not yet read the memo watch this Donald Trump never just allows himself to have a straight shot at anything here we have the State of the Union coming up tonight that should be the focus but instead you look at what happened last night in the house and you had Nunez nema which twists the truth and it plays these crude political games with highly secret intelligence that make up most of the Republicans who voted to release its controversial memo that the Justice Department said would be extraordinarily reckless had never even read the memo and many who did read new nas's memo say that it falsely summarized a reality and it's filled with all these falsehoods and and these these misleading conclusions all in an attempt to slur law-enforcement officers that Donald Trump I don't know how I should say this he's targeted them for a political purge now I don't know for sure yet if there was a conspiracy against Republicans at the FBI but the continued attempts of a one-sided press to ignore and even hide the steady and unceasing abuse of power by Obama and other Democrats does amount to a conspiracy a conspiracy of silence and that's no theory trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show see Topsy the Zipit easing its all right we got a busy day

they ensured that 20 week old babies can continue to be aborted I mean that's legal I think in 50 you know in 50 states I believe that's legal with some restrictions on now I got to stop here for a minute and just to be fair the Democrats Bob Casey and Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly actually supported they were trying to get the 60 votes they need to end the make-believe filibuster which really they should be getting rid of but they couldn't get the 60 votes and so three Democrats did vote for this measure to end 20 week old abortions of 20 week old babies and two Republicans senator Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski the liberal Republicans voted against it you know I I have to pause here before we get to the FBI 20 weeks you know I wrote this this movie the script about abortion and we kept talking about 20 weeks 20 weeks and somewhere along the line I stopped there with 20 weeks that's five months at five months a an expectant mother can tell you the personality of the baby she's carrying five months are you kidding me and a court of course they're now finding out big surprise that 20-week year-old infant unborn baby can feel pain so you're not just killing this poor creature you're torturing it unbelievable it is um this is unbelievable and you know I put this online sometimes I'll put it up on Twitter and I'll get these texts from pro-abortion people saying these tweets from pro-abortion people saying oh well no woman would abort that late unless she had a good reason when did that happen when did women become sparkly supernatural creatures who never do anything wrong I know women who shoot you in the head for 20 bucks worth of crack what are you talking about it women do this you're women abort children for all kinds of reasons including they want them to have a different star sign I mean you don't know what level of woman you're dealing with what level of human being you're dealing with and the other one I keep hearing is you can't force a woman to carry a baby to term which is like saying you know you can't force me not to kill my wife you know once you make a decision and that decision has consequences you incur those consequences when I decide to get married I can't just walk out the door I have to then go to law and say I want a divorce and I certainly can't blow my wife because because you know I have the right to this freedom to choose and that's what they're saying you made a decision you made the decision to have sex you made the decision and and you you're the one who got pregnant it didn't happen you weren't hit by the pregnancy both you know this is this is obscene the fact that this is the Democrats calling card that they did that and then they keep attacking this tax cut as if it's a bad thing that ordinary middle-class people are gonna get some extra money in their paycheck they keep saying oh it's just crumbs crumbs a thousand dollars just crumbs it's just crumbs if you're a Democrat on the take maybe but you know we have thousand bucks is a lot of money for most of us for most people that is you know a good amount of money and that's kind of the bonuses they're handing out and the bonuses are gonna lead to higher pay that's also happening finally they went out of their way to shut down any talk of corruption at the FBI to keep information from you okay so first we had McCabe Andrew McCabe in this week of Andrews we had Andrew McCabe stepped down from so that's endemic that's democrats high taxes dead babies and censorship thanks thanks a lot guys so the head of the FBI apparently this is source material but they say that he pressured andrew mckay to leave now there's a very soft landing he's gonna retire in march anyway he's still gonna get his paycheck he's still gonna get his full pension but it's just get out of the way and we don't know why this happens we don't know whether there's something bad coming down the pike and christopher ray heard about it that from the inspector general's report and the Justice Department has an inspector general studying the FBI's treatment of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and so maybe there was something in that but also Christopher wey went on and he saw this Pfizer memo okay and but according to the press this is well I'm not sure I have time to plays but I equated to the press there's only one reason there's only one reason that mccabe stepped down and that is donald trump forced him out as a way of wrong footing the the investigation into russia i won't play the montage but all the networks that's all they were saying it's one after another he's killing him off it's like a holocaust of FBI agent and they keep peddling this thing of like he's lessening our trust in the FBI i mean we're the last time we had complete trust in the FBI we got Jay Edgar Hoover you know I mean that's that was the kind of thing we had where you wouldn't question the FBI are you because we might show up at your house you know well question anybody there you're just the government you just work for us and if you get dirty we're gonna clean you out that's the way it works so so this is all about the FISA memo the other reason he might have gone as Christopher Rea went and looked at the Pfizer memo the Devon Nunez who wrote the FISA memo and has at least organized the FISA memo invited ready to come in and say look at this just take a look at this and tell me what you think before we vote to release it now let's talk about what this is about FISA obviously Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act okay now this was passed people forget this but this was passed during the Nixon after the Nixon administration 1978 because Nixon had been spying using foreign intelligence warrants to spy on radical demonstrators within the country right it was all this kind of in the in the 60s all the riots all the demonstrations and Nixon had been using spying on our own people and they said no well you've got to go to a FISA Court it's a secret court but you have got to show cause to spy on Americans we don't want the government spying on us this is supposed to be America right so the the thing that everybody's talking about is did the Obama Justice Department use this Oppo research called the steel dossier completely unverified information as part of the way to get FISA warrants to spy on the Donald Trump campaign there's one guy at Carter page I think his name is one guy they're saying was a Russian spy which it seems absurd but that that was the excuse they were giving to spy on so just think about this because there are Democrats now they're Democrats now saying you know well it may have been only one reason if you're using the DNC and Hillary Clinton paid for the steel dossier it was Russian misinformation it hasn't been verified to use that to spy not just on me on some American guy but to spy on an actual political opponent I mean that is bad you know that is bad that is a major major scandal and it is appalling the lack of curiosity the press are showing it's appalling I mean if this were obviously Republican corruption they'd be all over it but the fact that it is this great sacred Barack Obama who ran the government like a Chicago machine and it's coming out now and this is part of what's coming out again I don't know what's in the memo I'm not gonna tell you that it actually shows that they did this but if I were a reporter I would be salivating I mean I don't care Republican or Democrat I would think wow this is the story of my young lifetime this is the gonna be the big scandal that I cover in my life I would be all over this so here first of all Adam Schiff comes out and I've called him Joe McCarthy before but here is an actual video of Adam Schiff lying okay he comes out this guy who looks like a turtle escape from his shell and he comes out after they passed this vote and it's on along there are more Republicans than Democrats on the house Intel committee and they've that we're gonna release this memo which is what they say it is is a compilation of information they got that was otherwise classified so it's a scent essentially an end run around the classified information to release this information and here here he comes the cut I want on this is is cut number two right that motion was voted down by the majority the majority expressed a concern that something in the minority memoranda or otherwise could compromise sources and methods and for exactly that reason we asked that both memoranda be vetted by the FBI and the Department of Justice but that vote that was voted down so what he's saying there is they voted to release the GOP memo but voted not to release the DEM memo a counter memo that note that Adam Schiff wrote that's not true okay that is simply not true what they voted was before releasing the GOP memo they voted that everybody in the house should get to see it before they voted whether to release it to the public so now they voted to do the same thing to the Democrat memo before releasing it to make sure everybody in the house gets to read it before they release it to the public so they voted to do the same treat the Democratic member the same way they treated the Republican memo this in spite of the fact that the people who have seen the memo say that the Republican memo is about the FBI the Democrat memo is about the Republican memo so now they're coming out with this absolute panic to make sure you're gonna start to see some leaks by the way because as long as the Republicans were the only people who had seen this you saw no leaks but once the FBI gets ahold of it they they will start to leak it out what they'll do is they'll leak it out to make it seem like it's not as bad but you know it's bad because net sympathic OSI was on the Chris Cuomo show and Cuomo had the temerity at one point you almost never see anybody do this on CNN to push back a little bit and say why should we trust you you know why should why shouldn't we all know how political everybody is so why should we trust you and I took I had our guys take Pelosi and just put together all her answers that she made just one answer after another we have this montage of her is cut number seven during this amazing thing where once Chris Cuomo actually pushed back and said you know shouldn't the information go as if almost as if he were a journalist then wanted information released to the public which is what journalists are supposed to do he pushed back a little and she goes and she's insane I mean so this cut this is a montage cut number seven what they're putting forth is a total misrepresentation it is false and they're putting it out there as if it is factual and then saying we're going to show this to the American people but we're not going to show the rebutted rebuttal to it by the Democrats and this isn't to not to be politicized this is about fact this is about security or not it's about people in our country who worked so hard to protect the American people in the intelligence community and to be frivolous with their identity or roads that can lose to lead to them about you're saying that you think it puts lives at stake if this intelligence that is necessary for other countries to share with us why would they put it at the mercy of Dennis Nunez who doesn't even remember and say the American people should see it this dark cloud hangs over the Capitol is called their tax cut it's taken as two trillion dollars additional into debt that makes them afraid of concurring any further debt so they don't want to spend money on their domestic agenda and and look what they're doing with family unification making up a fake name chain chain they like the word chain that sends tremors through people in our well you read something in everything they're doing of course I do I'd see them every day a chest just just summarized below C's position she says the memo is false but it damages our national security so if the metal is false it doesn't damage anything because who knows you know it's not real information but it damages our security and it distracts from the fact that we now have lower taxes which is a disaster and meanwhile they're putting immigrants in Chains because they called chain migration that's her argument now compare this to trey Gowdy and this is before the vote to release the memo Gowdy went on Gabby who has backed the robert muller investigation relentlessly he has said leave him in his words leave him the hell alone let him do his job he has said this relentlessly but he when asked why they should release the memo on the sunday show this was his clearly reasonable answer this memo is nothing but a distilling the reducing of thousands of pages of documents provided to us by the Department and the bureau so there's nothing in this memo that the Department is not already aware of if you think your viewers want to know whether or not the dossier was used in court proceedings whether or not it was vetted before it was used whether or not has ever been vetted if you were interested and who paid for the dossier if you're interested in Christopher Steele's relationship with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee then yes you'll want the memo to come out if you're Adam Schiff who is consistently wrong when it comes to issues of disclosure he didn't want us to find out any of this information Chris he fought in fact GPS went to core fusion GPS went to court to keep us from finding out that the Democrats paid for the dossier so if you're Adam Schiff of course you don't want the information to come out you didn't want us to find it in the first place so so look a really simple question who do you trust the people who want information to come out to the public or the people including the press who are trying so hard to keep it secret for the answer let's ask someone who knows the only people who don't want to disclose the truth are people with something to hide Thank You President Obama Andrew Hyatt is coming up I had a terrific director who has directed a new movie about st. Paul we'll talk to him first but first we have to talk about Boleyn branch because Boleyn branch are these there's griffix sheets they are made from a hundred percent organ organic cotton which means they feel incredible they look amazing and since Boleyn branch sells exclusively online you're not paying the expensive retail price that you would for that that's half the price for twice the quality now these sheets will are great if you go to bed to sleep but if like me you go to bed to stay awake and lie awake and think about things then they're even better because you're comfortable all night long they're really only get more comfortable the more you watch them anyone who sleeps on bowling brown sheets loves them that's why they have thousands of five-star reviews the New York Times Forbes The Wall Street Journal all rave about them three u.s. presidents have Boleyn branch sheets and I myself and not one of them but I do have them to do I do love them they're very very nice and they really they have great designs you can just go and pick out anything go to Boleyn branch calm today and you'll get $50 off your first set of sheets which is great since they're already much less expensive they would then they would be in the store you get $50 off plus free shipping in the United States when you use the promo code Clavin you might say promo quickly that's a strange word how do you spell that well it's KL a VA n that's Rob likes to say there are no E's there is no ease in Clavin as everyone who knows me knows that's $50 off plus free us shipping right now at Boland branch dot-com that spelled bol L and branch dot-com because it's cotton that's why Boland branch comm promo code Clavin Boland branch comm promo code Clavin for great sheets for cheaper than you would get him in a store and then 50 bucks last because you listened to me alright we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but we will you can come on vu I lost my lost my train of thought there you come over to the tail acquire comm you can listen to the rest of the show or while you're there subscribe for a lousy 10 bucks a month and you can watch the show the whole thing right there and you don't have to be cast out and you can be in the mailbag the mailbag is tomorrow so get your questions in subscribe and get your questions in all right we will take a break so let me tell you about Andrew hi I met Andrew Hyatt he was working at empower which was it's still there it's not doing as much as he used to do but it was a way of funding trying to get money channel money and channel talent toward Christian based faith-based films or films with any kind of faith-based and Andrew and some of the other folks over there optioned a screenplay of mine and so we got to be friends and he invited me to one of his early kind of indie small pictures and it was called the frozen and I'm watching the frozen which was kind of a spooky film about people lost in the woods and there was one shot very early on in the frozen I remember it was guys on a snowmobile we're going by the woods and there was just a glimpse of somebody standing in the woods this very frightening thing and I have been telling directors forever that it's much scarier if something goes by so fast you almost don't see it than if they linger on it but directors do not have the real power to do it the minute I saw that shot because it was perfect it was just right it scared the hell out of me and I see and the whole audience who jumped but you just you weren't even sure you saw it minute I thought I thought oh this guy actually has talent he's not just this guy who hangs around he actually knows what he's doing and so he went on making small films Last Light was another one but then he made this film called full of grace about the Virgin Mary and it was really a turning point so let's bring him on andrew hyatt his new film Oh actually do we have the capability to play this promo for his new film is called Paul apostle of Christ I got that right Andrew that he's got and just to just today they released the promo for it right the trailer that's right before we talk to you let us watch the trailer for this I Luke send a message to all those that follow our Lord Jesus Christ there is a terrible evil in the world darkness is spreading no you are suffering persecution faith is being tested I know you question the way but I've come to Rome to find Paul to write his story to bring hope to bring light into this present darkness and to remind us all how God changed a hateful man who will change the history of the world caning from stained with the blood of our brothers and sisters this is what trusting God gets you people a desperate in the city I will well cut it there and let you go see the wrestler you've got a great eye Andrew you really do your pictures are they always look - they always look terrific anyway how you doing it's good to see you I'm doing good I feel like this is the future of the talk-show you and your fancy wood paneled room and me and my hotel room that's too much I always tell people like I don't see my friends anymore we just interview each other like yeah exactly so let's talk before we get to this your your small filmmaker you're making indie films there's obviously four none of us is their real future in that unless somebody starts to pick them up and then you make full of grace what what made you decide to do that well I you know I wish I could say I had this beautiful conversion and I felt called to make a film but honestly I was broke and these guys called me out of Chicago and I needed the money so yes it's that's the way fortunes you know one thing led to another and it was really a beautiful experience and really grew a lot through that film both as a filmmaker and just in my personal life and yeah this is what's led to Paul so it was it was a godsend for sure I mean full of Graces is a very small movie it really you know it's continues to be one of you know one of your indie films very beautifully shot the whole I mean it unbelievably good to look at and the acting is great and all that which is part of what directors do but then who then called you about doing the st. Paul we did it we did a small screening in LA after full of grace came out sort of a friends-and-family screening and a couple of friends that work at Sony came to it and they they felt the same way that you did about the film and gave me a call right after and said what are you working on next and I had been percolating this Paul idea for a while doing little bit of writing here and there and when I mentioned it to him they said well we've been looking for a Paul film for years haven't found anything we'd love to check it out when you're done and so you have finished the script send it off and it really was one right away if they said this is it you cracked the story let's let's go make the film wow that's what you know that's very rare yeah no it is very rare and also I mean one of the things that happened after Mel Gibson made Passion of the Christ is all these studios started building faith-based divisions right so Sony's what they call the firm is a firm film yeah a firm film so that's their faith-based division but because nobody in Hollywood actually has any faith they they kept making these movies these Bible movies that basically insulted anyone who believes in the Bible so they would make you know the Noah movie and it was about God to string the world for environmentalism and then they would make the Moses movie and Christian Bale terrific actor but he would go out there and say Moses was kind of a terrorist man you think like huh I'm not going to that movie you know and and then they would tell you oh well Bible based films don't make any money after insulting the people who would have gone to see them but in this case you are obviously the Vout guy or a faithful guy you wrote you must have written a story that basically reflected the biblical point of view right well you're spot-on I mean a lot of films since the passion of swung for the fence isn't completely missed and I just think we just took a very respectful reverent approach to it and we looked at Scripture and we said Kay how can we bring Paul to life in a way that is not just aimed at the Christian audience because I think that's sort of the failure of Hollywood is to yeah it's to think oh you know what we can get to these people we know how to talk them into going to see this film instead of let's just make a movie for this audience and that's what I really hope Paul is it's just for this audience it's yeah something that I believe will be inspiring encouraging and just respectful of who Paul is you know for millions and millions of people he is a superhero yeah easy he's more important than spider-man Superman Batman put together yeah and we tried to treat it with that reverence anything tomorrow would do to respectfully bring one of those characters to life we said let's do that with a Bible movie and see what happens so I'm excited for people to have the same response which is well wait a minute they actually did it right yeah because I mean the guy did I mean she went through shipwrecks he was tortured he was in prison and it is kind of a testimony to you know the a lot of these guys were preaching the gospel in Jewish areas where they were basically there they were putting their life on the line to tell people who had been there who had been there that this happened so you know they you know it wasn't like you could pull a con and it was like you were putting your life on the line so it had to be this intense faith experience and Paul obviously just went through hell to to say what he had to say or really an amazing story and Jim Caviezel isn't Jim Caviezel yeah Jim Caviezel plays Luke and then James Faulkner plays Paul okay and they were both phenomenal they both were very open to the goal as you know from my other films is to find the human touch to find a humanity through these characters instead of the normal cardboard cutout Bible figures and they were both very open to just going deep and find any humanity so the performances are wonderful from them and we've got a great great secondary cast as well now I know obviously you don't want you're not gonna diss the you know bite the hand that feeds you but religious in Hollywood can be an experience I mean to to sort of put forward the idea that an intelligent you know sane person believes in the things that are beyond the natural yeah just be a tough sell in a town that really revolves around money sex and you know prestige and is is there a place is have you now found that you have found a network of people who are friendly to walk toward what you're doing or are you still maneuvering through the cracks are you still kind of dodging bullets I think that we've definitely found those people and what's pretty amazing with Hollywood is I have to say I think there's less of a prejudice towards that when the dollar signs start adding up very quick yeah they're very quick to maneuver opinion if money is you know showing up in the bank and so I think that is a respect suddenly you know we put a couple of behind the scenes things out and some trailers out and the the feedback was was monumental I mean we had six and a half million views in two weeks on one of the teaser trailers and so I think it kind of made everybody stand back and say huh okay maybe there's something here I don't need to believe in it but if I can make some money off there's good yeah yeah you think you would think they would say that but after Mel Gibson turned like 25 million dollars into a billion dollars about you would thought they would have just started filming one Duyvil story I'll give me anybody I mean yeah I'll take anything but they did very blinders on point of view and I'm sure there are people out there that would love nothing more than to this kind of content not be made so I don't want to say that's a generalization but I've been you know blessed enough to be with the people that are being supportive and allowing us to do our thing and really not stepping on our toes with Scripture and what we feel is important to the audience which is is great now now let's look at this from the other side for a minute because one of the problems I have is that a lot of Christian films come out and that you know I don't like to name them because I don't I don't it's not like I hate them it's I find their rom-coms for Christian basically everything works out right whenever people stray from the Christian path bad things happen whenever they go back they're happy and joyful and you just sit there and go like wow I wish I wish that was life you know um but but it doesn't it doesn't resonate with me and I don't think it resonates with audiences who might be sympathetic who might turn up and say well you know st. Paul's a good story how do you how do you avoid that how do you avoid that kind of Candyland Christian I mean I hear you and yep we won't name names but yeah you know one of the things we just always approach him is he said you know just because you say yes to Jesus and you convert doesn't mean everything's wrapped up with a pretty bow and and your life works out it's just not it's not the story in fact it's not the scriptural story either you look as you said Paul goes through hell for 30 years preaching the gospel it wasn't I sent I didn't get a new car in a big house and and live happily ever after life change and he gave everything and so I think as much as we can avoid that sort of saccharine just vanilla approach to Christianity and just offer something deeper and more human and more of the experience that I think we all have I mean I would I'm like you I would love to meet the people that that's what happens today I go to church on Sunday and they win the lottery on Monday and it's like wow that's awesome to me you know I'm I'm a sinner I followed my face every day and and I need something a little deeper and a little more gritty and more human and I think that's what Paul offers and so we just hope that it's sort of maybe turns that ship a little bit as far as and I hear you that's the inspirational drama versus a real faith experience right exactly exactly a man Paul is a great example of that because I mean like like he's just he's such a tough guy he's a very hard-boiled individual and he goes through so much stuff and he never there's not one point in the letters where he starts to think like yeah maybe not you know maybe he's very very tough about the other thing that sometimes can just get in the way of storytelling I remember you did have this experience a little bit with full of grace was that you have to you have to toe a theological line you have to be very careful not to step on anybody's toes because there are some people who believe if you stray one word from the Gospels or one word from the Bible you're gonna go up in smoke how hard it is how hard is it to convince Christians to let you tell your story to let you tell a story as a story that's a great point and I think all we can really do is we try to just be so so woven into scripture that there's never a moment in the movie that we feel that we've stepped over that line and of course some has to be fictionalized we don't have everything of course you know the the villain of the movie is sort of a combination of Romans that appear in the Bible and we've had to put it into one character so while yes it's fictionalized that would never feel at any moment that we're sort of making that that we can't say for certain would exist or had existed or really fall into line in Scripture and I think that's that's the hard thing is just sort of you up every checks and balance to just say man I know we have to say that this happened and it's not here but okay look at what happened before after around we can safely say that this is this is a fair assessment a family and everybody really wanting to again be really respectful to Paul and bring something beautiful to this character in this story that it sort of gets away from as you said the Hollywood approach of wow that's not that's not narrative ly interesting let's just change the whole dynamic you know Shirley I'm sure they you know you'll notice so so what now I mean are you afraid of getting typecast as like the Bible guy or I mean do you want to go on and make a broader range of storage you know I mean from the earlier films you saw I love thrillers I love horror movies I love The Twilight Zone and these things so I'm always open to anything but it's wherever God is leading you know I'm gonna go and you know depending on Co sort of the response to this there's there's other stories in that vein that I find very interesting and then there were other stories outside of the realm and that are also interesting so nothing at the moment we're just kind of all eggs into the Paul basket for the next month we finish the film and then we'll see what happens so it comes out March 28th March 28th yep exactly right March 28th so Easter weekend and nationwide and so we just hope that there's a great buzz great response and yeah we'll find it encouraging and inspirational and bring your friends yeah yeah very exciting and very exciting now you you can invite me to a pre-screening so I can talk it up and you're gonna get an invite very soon yeah I'm looking forward to it Andrew congratulations it's great it's a it's a great thing and I've seen your stuff you are a terrific director so I'm sure it's gonna be great Andrew Hyatt the in the name of the film give me the real name of the film so I get it exactly right Paul apostle of Christ Paul Gosselaar Christ March 28th all right I'll see you soon thank you okay that it does look good I mean the guy's got an eye you know like it's just that that first moment that I saw that guy standing in the woods and I thought that's the way that you do that that is how you do that you really got a good eye all right sexual far from Paul the sexual Follies would so jimmy kimmel after the State of the Union who has become a smarmy kind of you know political operator you know using emotions to sell his point of view he's having this porn star on after the State of the Union on his show the points are that Trump is president Trump has been accused of sleeping with and having an affair with and you know it's really interesting to me that whenever whenever there's a sex scandal on the right with the second with the left cuz the left is all for sex right though all the left ever sells is sex any kind of sex you want and you won't even be any sex you want and do anything you want that no one has any right to say anything you can't shame people you can't shame people about anything they do but suddenly it becomes an issue and what they always say says say is on the right it's hypocrisy because if it's you know they're accusing Ted Cruz of something well he's a big Christian so he's a hypocrite that they don't really understand what Christianity or hypocrisy means but that's okay at least they're making a point point with Donald Trump he's a billionaire who ran beauty contests we know exactly what he was doing we have we have no doubt in our mind how Donald Trump was spending his free time so why is this even a story and why it is Jimmy Kimmel against sleeping with porn stars does he not think one should sleep with boys what is exactly is he saying see the whole thing is it's not the sex it's the politics and we have been taken in by this too long part of this is because Ronald Reagan helped bring the evangelicals into the conservative movement and into the Republican Party and we have used their votes and conservatives and evangelicals get very excited about this these sex issues but do they really matter very much in politics if we are talking about people doing what they do in other words they're not talking about rape we're not talking about beating somebody up Michael what just to show you that this is not sexist about politics this guy Michael Wolfe who wrote this book was called fire and fury which is just innuendo he went on and did something so disgusting that even an occasional Democrat he was on Bill Maher show and Maher was encouraging him and he said is there anything in the book that we don't know about it was obviously a setup obviously Maher knew what he was going to say and he started dropping these this in your window oh yes he Trump is sleeping with someone right now and if you read my book carefully you know where it is let's listen to this who's II have to read between the lines what lines tell us the line you say it's in the book it's toward the end of the bouquet well it's in the book and we good you know you just you just have to you'll know it oh now that I've told you okay when you hit that paragraph you're gonna sell right bingo oh all right so you're gonna say bingo apparently people who read the book and I'm not going to read the book I am my life is too short it's come out and say there's this innuendo about nikki Haley now I make lots of jokes about nikki Haley I make lots of sex jokes I make jokes about everything so I feel absolutely free to do this but if you have not got that information and apparently he has not got it and some of the stuff he says you know he says oh she's spending a lot of time on Air Force One she says I've been on Air Force One once and you know there were plenty of other people there and I've never you know been alone with the president now all this she just completely completely denies it but there's even that in the New York Times Barry Weiss over there who is she is the daughter of white oh I can't remember his wife's who writes for The Wall Street Journal she's kind of got a more conservative point of view but she goes off and she says if if they had done that to Barack Obama and the ambassador at the time Samantha whatever her name was if he had gone off and done that people would have heads would have exploded I mean people would have exploded to basically say oh here's a powerful woman I'm going to accuse her of sleeping with the boss she must have gotten that job by sleeping with the boss should be you know anti feminism 101 right this is a an insult to every woman who has made it on her own you know I make all these jokes about nikki Haley but there's actually jokes about me they were joke about my reaction to nikki Haley she's obviously doing a great job I continually say she's doing a great job it's not about sex it's about politics the hypocrisy is so strong with the Democrats because it's never about sex it's just about getting you outraged and I said this about Roy Moore - I don't like worry more I don't like what he stands for I don't like what he says I don't like what he pretends to be but that stuff about the sex was just about politics just to show you because it happened in real time on the view senator Kirsten Gillibrand Gillibrand was going around making a big fuss over Donald Trump and women oh he should be basically she's saying he should be thrown out of office for the things he has done with women none of which we actually know megan mccain pointed out that kirsten gillibrand was a big supporter of both Hillary and Bill Clinton and just watch her change direction in mid-flight watch this let's talk about Trump first he has multiple allegations dozens of allocate over a dozen allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment he should resign because of that okay there you go start the trend he should be held accountable and because he's unwilling to resign Congress should be doing hearings where are the hearings on all of these allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment he should be held accountable consience on these subjects again it shouldn't be a partisan issue we should be having a very different conversation about President Trump and we should be holding him accountable and we should be having hearing senator you have dedicated her political career to this fight obviously and that's why a lot of people were really surprised that it took you 20 years to say that Bill Clinton should have resigned over the Lewinsky scandal so what do you say to that I think this moment of time were in is very different I don't think we had the same conversation back then the same lens we didn't hold people accountable in the same way that this moment is demanding today I think all of us or many of us did not have that same lens and myself included but today we are having a very different conversation but people on the right we're having that conversation then it's only about politics it's not about sex it's about politics it really is none of our business who people sleep with if it's consensual even if they cheat on their wives it's really none of our business yeah do I want a guy in office who has some kind of integrity who is not you know who's not running around who's not depraved of course I do but are we going to surrender to Germany because Eisenhower cheated on his wife he did you know but that doesn't mean we're gonna and Poland back there Germany you know it's not the way it works didn't think of it this way if if you or your child god forbid needed a heart operation and the greatest heart surgeon in the world was a Donald Trump smirking businessman who went around grabbing women and the fifth best heart surgeon in the world was a devout Christian who was wise to you know good to his family and never cheated who would you have do the heart surgery on your kid me I'd have the Trump guy I mean every single time and that's basically what we're dealing with the presidency Senators Congressmen it's a job it is a job their job is to make us free to keep us free we know what their job is it's described in our founding documents as to ensure our rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Donald Trump is doing that no he has done a really good job of that in his first year all of this sex stuff it is just about politics they do not care and if they don't care I don't see why we should either all I care about is being
