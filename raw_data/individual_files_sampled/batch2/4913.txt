president Trump is scoring a big win with his successful renegotiation of the trade deal formerly known as NAFTA and while his methods may be unpopular he is delivering on some of his biggest campaign promises on trade not only his Trump renegotiated NAFTA he has revised the US trade deal with South Korea and is in the process of renegotiating the current deal with Japan Trump promised to pull out of other so-called bad deals for the US and he has since he took office the US has left the trans-pacific partnership or TPP the Paris climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal making good on his promise to cut taxes for businesses and workers he signed a trillion dollar tax overhaul back in December which cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent lowers individual rates and doubles the standard deduction as for Trump's promised to slash regulations the administration says it has withdrawn or delayed more than 1500 Obama rule proposals and it has also taken 67 d regulatory actions while imposing only three new regulations Trump is following through on his promise to reshape the judiciary he has appointed Neal Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and has another conservative nominee of course Brett Kavanaugh waiting in the wings he has also gotten get your head around this sixty-eight judges confirmed to the federal courts finally Trump is cracking down on immigration he fought for it and got a revised travel ban put a zero-tolerance policy in place at the border and has enacted rules that limit the amount of refugees asylum seekers and other immigrants that come into the country joining us now is Republican strategist Rick Tyler okay Rick when you take that list the president can tick through it for a campaign ad and some people could say well look he kept his promises but those promises that he kept are not only not just a win for many Republicans for most Americans so are they really a win it's a bit of a mixed bag Stephanie I'd say look I'd say on the NAFTA we really have NAFTA dole certain have to do whatever you whatever you want to say about it the changes weren't really they were marginal changes that NAFTA was being renegotiated anyway it needed to be updated it was who was essentially taking a 2,000 page document ripping off the cover putting a new name on it adding a new chapter and doing some editing so you know what's amazing is Donald Trump is now joined the globalist and it's convinced his base that he's ripped up NAFTA and and what he's done is really important embraced NAFTA embraced substantially what NAFTA was because most of it remains in place on taxes I would say that I think he got a big win there but it remains to be seen if most Americans will feel that corporations got it people who own investments saw a big bump in the stock market and that's good and I think in the long run it's good Indig regulation I support all those things but whether it's a political win in in the coming of this November or houses re-election it remains to be seen big taxes the tax cut hasn't worked in terms of polling because it shows that most people don't believe they still think the fixes in that only the elite and the very small people at the top which is largely true got the benefit of the tax cut and they still think the whole tax system is a rigged game yes the question is if you take Jews NAFTA that's an example you take something that maybe required some fixing you you claim to rip it up or you there's a claim it's a disaster claim it's a disaster you you decide you're gonna destroy it then you as you say you clean it up put a new cover on it presented and you get to tick it off as a success for people who are not involved in the news as much as the three of us are it's a talking point it may be a successful one in some quarters so it's going to be very successful but look through the elections are coming up in five weeks and people are not going to go through and read NAFTA or I'm not going to feel the implications of change but say take for instance on the automobile industry right what what who really benefited that was the Mexican auto worker right they've got a big huge raise that's gonna result in higher prices most likely for most American consumers on cars but it will also leave American producers and manufacturers of automobiles to search for ways to automate because they've got to compete with lower prices and so they need to get those prices down how are they going to do that the workers are the most expensive thing so they're actually it's it's sort of a rush to automation so look I don't believe in in planned economies from you know the central office no one would we talked to yours ago about you know wood wood Amazon ever become profitable well now they're so profitable they just gave all their employees a minimum of $15 double the minimum wage so that I mean there's the they're rolling cash no one would have predicted a bad about Google Apple we used to joke about that it was not gonna make it because it was this small niche company that couldn't compete with Microsoft well look at Apple now so so I just don't believe in these long these big broad brush we're gonna save the economy I don't know exactly what's gonna happen with NAFTA the dairy farmers got a little something marginal but as the Canadian said they can be really hurt by this in the American farmer they're getting three and a half percent of the Canadian market and it's a small market so that's not that's nothing I mean it's okay that was definitely an issue that the Brecon have made larger than it might have been I say to you it's a cheesy win but it's a win hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click
