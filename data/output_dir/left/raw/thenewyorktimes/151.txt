1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,760
“Give me your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses yearning

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,120
to breathe free” is
just a poem on a statue.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,890
When it comes to
protecting America

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,770
from undocumented immigrants
and asylum seekers,

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,120
the government is
finally stepping up.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,240
This isn’t the first time
we’ve detained thousands of people

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,270
we’re afraid of.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,340
During World War II, we protected our country

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,690
by forcing Japanese-Americans
into internment camps.

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,280
We even made this
handy propaganda film

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,189
to make us all
feel fine about it.

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,760
The uncertainty of
what would happen

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,910
among these people in case
of a Japanese invasion

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,740
still remained.

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,490
That is why all Japanese
within the coastal areas

16
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,130
should move inland.

17
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,400
We are protecting
ourselves without violating

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,680
the principles of
Christian decency.

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,890
In Romans 13:

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,850
“To obey the laws
of the government

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,650
because God has
ordained the government.”

22
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,900
History won’t repeat
itself on its own.

23
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,550
It takes good old-fashioned
elbow grease.

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,950
Whether it’s immigration
or the travel ban,

25
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,030
we’ve got your back.

26
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,630
Newly arrived immigrants
full of potential

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,510
come to the border
looking for safety

28
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,480
and to pursue their
American dream.

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,410
Little do they know that
dream is dead.

30
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,300
Now, zero tolerance
doesn’t mean zero fun.

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,750
We first launched our program
with special tender-age

32
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,520
centers.

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,780
Sorry, parents.

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,880
This is a kids-only zone.

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,690
They receive three
square meals a day,

36
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,690
shiny blankets and trauma

37
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,175
they can keep for the
rest of their lives.

38
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,870
We give them meals, we give them education.

39
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,610
We give them medical care.

40
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,550
There’s videos.

41
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,440
There’s TVs.

42
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,990
The Army provided
housing, plenty

43
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,810
of healthful, nourishing
food for all.

44
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,020
The residents of the new community set
about developing a way of life

45
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,360
as nearly normal as possible.

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,950
We know this
probably looks crazy.

47
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,650
But don’t worry,
the administration

48
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,120
knows exactly what
they’re doing.

49
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,640
No more free passes,
no more get-out-of-jail-

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,890
free cards, no
more lawlessness.

51
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,110
I hate the children
being taken away.

52
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,050
The Democrats have to change
their law, that’s their law.

53
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,746
We would like to
fix these loopholes.

54
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:07,620
And if Democrats want
to get serious about it

55
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,160
instead of playing
political games —

56
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,560
They can’t do it through
an executive order.

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,670
Thank you, sir, for
your leadership.

58
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,503
Thank you very much.

59
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:14,140
Great job.

60
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,430
O.K.

61
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,270
You‘re going to have a lot
of happy people.

62
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,010
Naturally, the newcomers looked
about with some curiosity.

63
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,630
They were in a new area,
on land that was raw,

64
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,110
untamed, but full of opportunity.

65
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,130
Here they would build schools,
educate their children,

66
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,710
reclaim the desert.

67
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,400
More than 2,300 children were
separated from their parents

68
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,760
since April, with no imminent
plans to reunite them.

69
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,010
But after the president’s executive order,

70
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,740
families will
be detained together.

71
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,320
And it’s all being done
in the name of deterrence.

72
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,240
Another way of saying,
scaring the [expletive] out

73
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,860
of immigrants who
are already scared

74
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,350
so [expletive] they’ve left
everything behind and risked

75
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,850
their life.

76
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,680
Now, deterrence isn’t
a long-term solution.

77
00:03:00,680 --> 00:00:00,000
But it sure sounds like it’s keeping you safe.
