One thing I do think about a
lot is the pollution because
I see it, especially living so
close to these, these containers
like there's some, I don't know 
what's coming out of them, I really don't,
but the smell, sometimes is very
strong like ammonia.
It gets you, like sometimes it
just hurts when you breathe it,
breath in, 
you have to go inside.
People say well,
why don't you move?
I wish I could.
I wish I could.
As soon as I get an 
opportunity, yeah I'll move.
It's just sad that
living here for so long,
we do have a lot of memories
here. I mean all my kids are
born here and stuff.
But I've learned to just live
with it.
Mainly we're just 
taking it day by day.
It's just something normal 
for for me and my family.
You would think, man 
there's families there,
but it's about the money.
They don't care about families
they don't care about you.
They don't care how it's affecting you.
We don't have a voice, you know.
We could go complain
to the civic leaders, we
could go and email our
whatever representatives and stuff.
Until now, I have not seen
anything done, 
nothing.
