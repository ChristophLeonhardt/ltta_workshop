1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,179
people clap I but sound and where to set

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,549
but what the protocol some was today it

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:08,820
finished today it went<font color="#CCCCCC"> so well it went</font>

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,889
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a genuine like I know that this is</font>

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,870
kind of cliche to say what it went so

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,000
much better than my wildest dreams I can

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,320
never have imagined<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we would have</font>

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,539
raised over<font color="#E5E5E5"> two million dollars had you</font>

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,779
asked me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other day I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had uh-huh no</font>

10
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,480
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen but it happened you</font>

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,970
raised so much money it was so good it

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,039
was so much fun it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so easy I got the</font>

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,170
rest I'm exhausted right now but I've

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">been running on this adrenaline</font>

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,200
afterwards and getting so much done<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,320
flat so clean right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,850
was amazing it was amazing and it left

18
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,590
me with this feeling again of being

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,840
proactive and doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be</font>

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,670
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have conversations that are</font>

21
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,989
difficult without them being

22
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,430
conversations that turned into ad

23
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,670
hominem attacks and just disgusting

24
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,199
horrible things being thrown to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

25
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,000
other and everyone ending out feeling

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,829
like they either side of the massive

27
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,780
crack that's the end of indiana jones

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,699
and the last crusade you know which one

29
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,859
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean when then being for so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

30
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,719
want to spoil it for anyone but you know

31
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,270
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean anyway I feel a bit more</font>

32
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,229
like the bit way to the leap of faith

33
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,479
but that's why I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I feel like</font>

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,610
I've just done<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and I hit something</font>

35
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,830
and it feels great and you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

36
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">something from a different perspective</font>

37
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,860
you're seeing a bridge that you didn't

38
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,140
see before have I mentioned that i'm

39
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,909
really tired but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to make this</font>

40
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,020
video right now because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to</font>

41
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember this feeling I definitely do</font>

42
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,770
think I'll ever forget the feeling when

43
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,229
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to seem like we were crossing</font>

44
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">two million because I feel like number i</font>

45
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,640
really like numbers very much they

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,470
confuse me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stress me out as anyone</font>

47
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">who watch the live stream will know and</font>

48
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,159
so we try to read it out large numbers

49
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">and i have a lot of personal shame</font>

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,189
associated with maths and wherever it's

51
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,570
fine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel like numbers have been</font>

52
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,950
against<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

53
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,390
bit that's been particularly painful

54
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,369
about big numbers this year especially

55
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,649
like with results kinds of numbers like

56
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:53,970
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just something about it it's</font>

57
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">just that very sinister and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just see</font>

58
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,610
this big beautiful brilliant<font color="#E5E5E5"> number full</font>

59
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,649
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming together to give what</font>

60
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,850
they can and contribute their time

61
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,170
as well like a number of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> whose</font>

62
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,360
names i saw a gain in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gain of chat</font>

63
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,568
and just sharing sharing videos and

64
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:12,760
watching things and i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know i love</font>

65
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">it i love the protocol awesome it makes</font>

66
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,670
me feel full<font color="#CCCCCC"> of love and full of</font>

67
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,069
possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> i suppose and the best of</font>

68
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:22,420
the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> things didn't happen</font>

69
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,950
overnight making<font color="#CCCCCC"> these conversations</font>

70
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,709
happen it takes time and that's also

71
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,090
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what I wanted to look like today</font>

72
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,130
because sometimes I feel very frustrated

73
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,290
with myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> on I don't feel like my</font>

74
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,209
actions are living up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my values to be</font>

75
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:35,770
honest the two biggest causes of that

76
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,750
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me right now are the amount plane</font>

77
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,470
trouble that I do and shopping

78
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,819
unsustainably shopping unethically I'm

79
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,769
not big shopper I've been had a huge

80
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus on reducing my wardrobe over the</font>

81
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,220
last couple of years which has been very

82
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful and just reducing my things</font>

83
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,640
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is again very privileged position</font>

84
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,220
to be in but I have found that that has

85
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,680
taken away Lee that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of urgent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

86
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,600
sort of feeling I can walk around target

87
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,610
and not need to buy anything because I

88
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,890
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> that feeling go through me and then</font>

89
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,959
I let the go away and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

90
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,579
if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need attached to things that on a</font>

91
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:11,709
rational level<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I don't need and</font>

92
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,329
that might sound like an obvious thing

93
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,000
to say but I ask someone who definitely

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,920
went through periods of shopping really

95
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,070
impulsively and shopping when I felt

96
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,019
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> depressed in this point I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

97
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:24,790
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like my body and impulsively buy</font>

98
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,370
something that's changed and I think

99
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that for me has been a move towards</font>

100
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,630
sustainable living in general but I

101
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,150
still the bulk of my wardrobe<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Topshop</font>

102
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,450
and i worked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> topman like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know some</font>

103
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,040
of the behind the scenes but most of it

104
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,840
you don't know because it's conveniently

105
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,810
out of focus so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to</font>

106
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can like feel</font>

107
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,750
great and like put together a nice and

108
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,370
like the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world to give</font>

109
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,049
whatever speech you're giving but you're

110
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:57,760
wearing clothes that were made by people

111
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,450
who are in conditions that we should

112
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,850
consider slavery if we if we don't

113
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,100
already sometimes we have conversations

114
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,410
about issues like that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we allow</font>

115
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,470
enough space or Aaron

116
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,690
a difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that</font>

117
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,980
situation is wrong and that's something

118
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,140
that we should fix and saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

119
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,798
person is wrong in that situation

120
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,540
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that puts people</font>

121
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,400
inclined to be like well this this

122
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,620
situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> has me dealing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

123
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,820
skill and shame that I don't want to

124
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,890
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go this way and come</font>

125
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,540
up with a narrative that's contrary to

126
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,040
this so that I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

127
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,450
this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here my thinking is</font>

128
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,210
maybe it's a sort comparison between

129
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,370
being forgiving to yourself and kind

130
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,720
yourself when you make mistakes you

131
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get everything perfectly right all</font>

132
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,220
the time but then also not letting that

133
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,470
not have you make an effort you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font>

134
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,150
not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think about your line of</font>

135
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,800
thinking and have conversations with

136
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,600
people and read more and include more

137
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,220
people in those conversations especially

138
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,510
people who are in situations<font color="#E5E5E5"> of forced</font>

139
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">labor and don't have access a lot of the</font>

140
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,150
time to the platforms that we have to

141
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,680
talk over these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's one</font>

142
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,970
thing to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here and talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

143
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,280
but it's kind of like we're in a very

144
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,770
nice oak panelled dining room and we've

145
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,830
closed the door and people can't even

146
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">get inside the building let alone get</font>

147
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,640
inside the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> while we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having this</font>

148
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,140
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some things</font>

149
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,640
I'm thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I want to be able</font>

150
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,680
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about them with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind of</font>

151
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">generosity and a kind of good</font>

152
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,770
spiritedness that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about things</font>

153
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,530
during the project for awesome and I do

154
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that that kind of approach which I</font>

155
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,020
am slowly learning has been more long

156
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,940
lasting for me personally like<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

157
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">example when I tried to be vegan</font>

158
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,110
immediately very quickly it was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

159
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,390
for my mental health<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was very bad</font>

160
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,880
for a lot of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things particularly</font>

161
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,220
the guilt and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shame side of things but</font>

162
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">now I eat probably less dairy etc that I</font>

163
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,240
ever have in my entire life that's

164
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,350
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about at the moment</font>

165
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,710
living more sustainably and the kind

166
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,050
the nuances of that as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all the</font>

167
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,160
little things that we surround ourselves

168
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,080
with like the rolling pin that I for a

169
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,320
little while ago the ladle that I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

170
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know the helmet for my bike those</font>

171
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,600
are all things that I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to be</font>

172
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,580
included in that conversation the little

173
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,860
ceramic that houses a candle<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have and</font>

174
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that realizing how much stuff</font>

175
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,860
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much we let fade into</font>

176
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,870
the background is just kind of extra

177
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,090
bits and pieces will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really helpful</font>

178
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,800
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also trying to be really</font>

179
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,930
mindful with my shopping where possible

180
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,790
but again that's like a cost thing comes

181
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,220
into that sometimes and I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

182
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,810
avoid anything that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> single-use</font>

183
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">plastic and then general use bulk bins</font>

184
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,600
more and have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big-ass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk of things</font>

185
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,420
in my ladder and in larger quantities

186
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,670
but that's process and it takes time and

187
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,180
it takes time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build up something that</font>

188
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get into a habit of using so you</font>

189
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,170
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it and it doesn't</font>

190
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,600
become this huge big pain it takes time

191
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,510
to be in financial situation where you

192
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,950
feel comfortable enough to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

193
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,260
decisions and it also takes time for you

194
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,150
to sit and recognize the patterns and

195
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,740
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking but you might want to</font>

196
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">change or try something different or</font>

197
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,910
which may be inform the choices that you

198
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,830
make it you don't feel online with your

199
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">values and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that you still</font>

200
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,210
have to tackle because for me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

201
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,920
something that's over part of the reason

202
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,990
why there's so much topshop in my

203
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,390
wardrobe admittedly a lot of it is all

204
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,880
stuff that you see me wear 20,000 times

205
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,550
and is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> topshop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has sizing I feel</font>

206
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,800
comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and that I know and has</font>

207
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,260
like fashion that it makes me feel

208
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">comfortable my body that it's these</font>

209
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,770
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like in that feel like</font>

210
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,180
expression rather than a lot of

211
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">fairtrade yes core brands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that make</font>

212
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,350
clothes in you know that don't fit

213
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">people with hips and he wants straight</font>

214
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,150
narrow or just things that earth they

215
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,740
make things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very bland sometimes</font>

216
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,500
and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want a bit more going on</font>

217
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,930
there I'm a Londoner at heart and

218
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,620
Mexican<font color="#E5E5E5"> Londoner like I need color and</font>

219
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,410
pattern to feel like I'm being myself so

220
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,870
it's things like that that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

221
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,820
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> up against and tackling and I</font>

222
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,320
just feel

223
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,180
it's moving a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of little different</font>

224
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,760
parts it's not a bright line it's not a

225
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,770
one-time decision either you constantly

226
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,360
make choices<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your life and there are</font>

227
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,680
times maybe when you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> better choices</font>

228
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,500
and times when you make wise choices but

229
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,010
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could all learn to be a</font>

230
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,870
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> generous with the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk</font>

231
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,120
to each other and it was very exciting

232
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to me to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see that's very generous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> II in</font>
