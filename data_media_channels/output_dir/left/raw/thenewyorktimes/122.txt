1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,560
These are the members of NATO,

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,280
a military alliance formed in 1949

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,759
to protect European countries

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,322
against the Soviet Union.

5
00:00:09,322 --> 00:00:11,217
“Only a strong
defensive alliance

6
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:14,730
could deter them
from further adventures.”

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,530
NATO now includes
29 countries,

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,950
including three that are
former Soviet states.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,760
“Estonia …

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,745
Latvia …

11
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:26,305
Lituania.”

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,920
The Soviet Union may have collapsed,

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,189
but Russia is still trying
to wield influence

14
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,750
over the region and undermine
nations who get in its way.

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,780
How?

16
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,680
By trying to destabilize
America and Europe,

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,580
and damage their relationship.

18
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,590
The goal: to weaken alliances

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,310
so Russia can more freely
pursue its interests.

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,090
From cybermeddling
to mind games,

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,090
here’s how the country and
its leader, Vladimir Putin,

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,430
excel at geostrategic trolling.

23
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,490
One tactic?

24
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:04,315
The method:

25
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,180
Invade a foreign nation,

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,670
reject the outcry

27
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,590
and hold the territory.

28
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,860
Exhibit A:

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,320
Just as Ukraine was embarking

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,630
on a pro-Western course 
and possibly joining NATO,

31
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,140
Russian-backed rebels
seized Crimea.

32
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,300
They’ve been there ever since.

33
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,160
And Russia even
built a massive bridge

34
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,606
to connect to the area.

35
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,360
Method:

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,710
Stoke instability,

37
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,180
claim innocence.

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,600
Exhibit A:

39
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,060
“Little green men.”

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,250
Russia claimed the
insignia-free forces

41
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,850
who took over strategic
locations in Crimea

42
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,260
were not the Russian
military, but instead

43
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,180
were “separatists.”

44
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,120
Putin eventually admitted
that the men were his troops,

45
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,000
once Crimea was under control.

46
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,370
Method:

47
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,040
Posture the military
in provocative ways.

48
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,090
Exhibit A:

49
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,040
Deploying next generation
nuclear-capable missiles

50
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,510
at NATO’s doorstep.

51
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,820
Method:

52
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,600
Undermine elections,

53
00:02:08,604 --> 00:02:09,775
trigger power outages —

54
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:10,443
“Ukraine.”

55
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:11,595
— leak emails.

56
00:02:12,222 --> 00:02:13,801
Exhibit A:

57
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,761
Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.

58
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,180
These were Russia-linked
hacking entities accused

59
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,460
of attacking
America’s elections.

60
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,190
The U.S. has indicted 12
Russian military officials

61
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,610
for the interference.

62
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,070
Use soft power
to hide ugly truths.

63
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,070
Method:

64
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,760
Host international
sporting events

65
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,520
to show you’re a
good global citizen.

66
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,760
Exhibit A: the World Cup,

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,030
which allows Russia
to gloss over charges

68
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,955
of human rights abuses
and international isolation.

69
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,300
Method:

70
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,910
Find a useful megaphone
for your message.

71
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,470
Exhibit A: Donald Trump.

72
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,450
The U.S. president
has been reluctant

73
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,360
to criticize Putin
for his country’s actions.

74
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,870
“And I might even end up
having a good relationship,

75
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,590
but they’re going:

76
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,550
‘President Putin
is K.G.B,’ and —

77
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,890
you know what,
Putin‘s fine.”

78
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,590
That’s made it
easier for Russia

79
00:03:07,590 --> 00:00:00,000
to achieve its aim of
weakening the world order.
