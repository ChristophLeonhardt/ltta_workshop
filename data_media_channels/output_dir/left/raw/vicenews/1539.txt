with vice news this afternoon in

before a presidential election<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

the press this is very very troubling

<font color="#E5E5E5">and we hope that the director we really</font>

think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he should give a clearer</font>

accounting of exactly what's going on

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,539
thing the FBI director is not doing a

job right he ought<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear</font>

28
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,530
rather than just kind of do this cryptic

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,750
reference 11 days before the election I

30
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,280
think that's important and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> how can</font>

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,510
you be so confident that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is not</font>

going to anything bad I mean aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only guy who doesn't really</font>

34
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,580
know what's in those emails well look I

35
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,590
I think they wouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> reached that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">conclusion after a vest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agaye shun that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">went on for multiple months unless they</font>

38
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,189
felt that they could state with some

39
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,900
certainty and they didn't say it was

40
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,880
close they<font color="#CCCCCC"> said no reasonable prosecutor</font>

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,119
would take this case and it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,210
close decision even<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that so the</font>

43
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,590
fact that they're now saying okay well

44
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,030
in another case we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

45
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,920
something and that may cause us to go

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,430
back and decide to reopen they reached a

47
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,560
pretty unequivocal determination they

48
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,049
didn't have to but they did obviously

49
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,759
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Republicans have been beating them</font>

50
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,460
up for it ever since and the Republicans

51
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,899
have seized on this and Donald Trump's

52
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,610
using it in a rally but 11 days before

53
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,409
an election strikes me as highly unusual

54
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I just hope that the director will</font>

55
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,960
give a fuller accounting of exactly what

56
00:01:54,960 --> 00:00:00,000
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> being examined</font>
