1
00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:00,595
SUMMIT.

2
00:00:00,595 --> 00:00:02,564
KIM HAS NOT LEFT HIS HOTEL

3
00:00:02,564 --> 00:00:03,031
YET.

4
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:03,932
GENTLEMEN, IF YOU WILL STICK

5
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:04,866
AROUND THROUGHOUT THE

6
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:05,934
EVENING, I APPRECIATE IT

7
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:07,336
WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN TO

8
00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:08,337
MARK STEYN WHO HAS BEEN

9
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:09,705
WATCHING THIS UNFOLD.

10
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:10,505
MARK, ARE YOU THERE?

11
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:13,742
>> YES, I AM, TUCKER.

12
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:14,409
>> Tucker: WHAT DO YOU MAKE

13
00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:14,943
OF THIS?

14
00:00:14,943 --> 00:00:16,478
THIS IS NOT -- IF YOU HAD TO

15
00:00:16,478 --> 00:00:17,579
MAKE A LIST OF PREDICTIONS

16
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:18,780
TWO YEARS AGO, THIS WOULD

17
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,315
NOT BE ON IT, I ASSUME.

18
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:23,085
>> NO.

19
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:25,887
BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES

20
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:26,888
THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

21
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:28,290
THIS IS AN UPSIDE DOWN

22
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,324
SUMMIT IN A WAY.

23
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:31,493
IT'S GOING TO START WITH HIM

24
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:32,527
AND KIM JUST IN THE ROOM

25
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:35,364
TOGETHER WITH NO ONE BUT

26
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:35,764
TRANSLATOR.

27
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:36,798
THAT'S REALLY THE OPPOSITE

28
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:38,333
OF THE WAY ALMOST ANY

29
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:38,934
INTERNATIONAL GATHERING

30
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:40,035
TAKES PLACE.

31
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:48,410
YOU KNOW, THE TERM SHERPAS,

32
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,778
MAP OUT THE SUMMIT GOING TO

33
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:50,645
BE.

34
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:51,947
WHEN 88% HAS BEEN SET IN

35
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:54,416
STONE, THEN THE LEADERS COME

36
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:58,387
IN AND BASICALLY PUT

37
00:00:58,387 --> 00:00:59,087
THEIR -- ON THIS.

38
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:00,455
THIS IS COMPLETELY THE

39
00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:00,822
OPPOSITE.

40
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:01,490
DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO

41
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,291
WALK INTO THAT ROOM AND HE'S

42
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,395
GOING TO MAKE HIS OWN

43
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:07,929
CALCULATION AS TO WHETHER

44
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:10,198
KIM JONG UN IS THERE IN GOOD

45
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:10,499
FAITH.

46
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:11,466
AND IT'S BASICALLY GOING TO

47
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:14,169
BE THE PRESIDENT WHO CALLS

48
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:15,137
IT AND DECIDES WHETHER OR

49
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:17,572
NOT THIS PROCESS IS SINCERE

50
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:19,708
AND IT'S FOR REAL.

51
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,476
AND THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT

52
00:01:21,476 --> 00:01:24,279
FROM THE WAY ALMOST ANY

53
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:27,549
OTHER INTERNATIONAL SUMMITRY

54
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,118
TAKES PLACE IN THE MODERN

55
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:30,419
WORLD.

56
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:31,620
>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE -- BY

57
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,422
THE WAY WE ARE WATCHING NOW

58
00:01:33,422 --> 00:01:35,223
THE PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE IN

59
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:36,324
SINGAPORE GOING TO THE

60
00:01:36,324 --> 00:01:39,628
SUMMIT SITE.

61
00:01:39,628 --> 00:01:40,629
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE WAY

62
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:41,530
THIS COME ABOUT?

63
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,130
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS

64
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,799
ANYONE WHO PREDICTED THIS.

65
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,200
AND IT CAME OUT OF THE

66
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,669
PRESIDENT'S KIND OF

67
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:51,273
SIGNATURE BELLICOSITY WHICH

68
00:01:51,273 --> 00:01:52,374
SUPPOSEDLY GETS YOU NOTHING

69
00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:54,342
BUT IN THIS CASE DID GET US

70
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:54,709
SOMETHING?

71
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:55,043
>> YEAH.

72
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:56,078
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

73
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:57,279
THE MOST EFFECTIVE THINGS.

74
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,780
YOU KNOW, THE WEAKNESS THE

75
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,016
WESTERN WORLD, GENERALLY, IS

76
00:02:01,016 --> 00:02:02,350
THAT WHEN WE ENTER INTO

77
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,788
TALKS OR TALKS ABOUT TALKS,

78
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:09,458
THESE THIRD WORLD DICTATORS

79
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,758
ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THAT OUR

80
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:12,494
PRIORITY IS TO BE IN A ROOM,

81
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:14,863
SITTING DOWN, TALKING, AND

82
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:15,864
GETTING AN AGREEMENT.

83
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:16,798
WE WILL DO ALMOST ANYTHING

84
00:02:16,798 --> 00:02:19,801
TO GET INTO A ROOM AND START

85
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:20,936
CHITCHATTING AND HAVING TEA

86
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:24,005
AND COFFEE AND COOKIES WITH

87
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:26,241
THE THIRD WORLD'S DICTATOR.

88
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:28,143
THE IRANIANS UNDERSTOOD

89
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:30,212
THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THEIR

90
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:31,847
NEGOTIATIONS FOR YEARS WITH

91
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:34,616
EUROPE AND THEN WITH THE

92
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:35,250
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

93
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,019
THIS IS THE COMPLETE

94
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:39,354
OPPOSITE.

95
00:02:39,354 --> 00:02:41,957
TRUMP'S SIGNATURE STYLE WAS

96
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:48,196
BASICALLY TO GO METAPHOR

97
00:02:48,196 --> 00:02:51,600
RICKLY NUCLEAR ON THE

98
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:51,933
REGIME.

99
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:53,201
WHEN IT WAS CLEAR HE WASN'T

100
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:54,736
LIKE OBAMA AND OTHER WESTERN

101
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:57,205
LEADERS TO OR THE

102
00:02:57,205 --> 00:02:57,239
LEADERS TO CR THE

103
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:57,272
LEADERS TO CARTHE

104
00:02:57,272 --> 00:02:57,305
LEADERS TO CARROE

105
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:58,140
LEADERS TO CARROT OF

106
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,540
NEGOTIATION.

107
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,276
JUST WHEN KIM WAS GETTING COCKYA

108
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:01,676
JUST WHEN KIM WAS GETTING COCKYD

109
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:03,345
HE DECIDED TO START TRASHING

110
00:03:03,345 --> 00:03:04,946
MIKE PENCE AND JOHN BOLTON

111
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:10,452
AND ALL THE REST OF IT AT

112
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:12,154
THAT POINT TRUMP YANKED THE

113
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:13,355
RUG OUT FROM UNDERNEATH OF

114
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:13,655
THEM.

115
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:14,723
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT

116
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:15,257
STYLE.

117
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:16,758
THE HOUSE TRAINED WESTERN

118
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:19,761
LEADER IS BEHAVING AS

119
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:21,997
UNPREDICTABLY AS THE THIRD

120
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:22,931
WORLD BASKET CASE GUY.

121
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:23,932
THAT'S A COMPLETELY

122
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:24,666
DIFFERENT STYLE OF

123
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:28,803
NEGOTIATION.

124
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:29,504
>> Tucker: WHOSE MOTORCADE

125
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:32,941
WE ARE JUST WATCHING PASS BY

126
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:38,680
WE SAW IT SAN SCRIPT FOR

127
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:38,980
PEACE.

128
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,081
THIS IS A MAN WHO DOESN'T

129
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:41,550
LEAVE HIS COUNTRY VERY

130
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:41,883
OFTEN.

131
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:43,685
SINCE RETURNING DIPLOMA

132
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:45,120
SWITZERLAND HE HAS LEFT ONLY

133
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,854
A COUPLE TIMES.

134
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:48,123
ONCE TO CHINA BY ARMORED

135
00:03:48,123 --> 00:03:49,191
TRAIN.

136
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:50,659
KIND OF REMARKABLE THAT HE

137
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:52,093
HAS LEFT NORTH KOREA TO COME

138
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:53,261
TO SINGAPORE FOR THIS.

139
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:54,429
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HE HOPES

140
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:55,197
TO GET OUT OF IT?

141
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:56,698
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT

142
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:58,133
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING WHEN

143
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,735
HE WAS TOURING THAT CASINO

144
00:04:00,735 --> 00:04:01,836
LAST NIGHT.

145
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:03,672
HE IS ACTUALLY GETTING A

146
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:05,707
GLIMPSE OF WHAT ALMOST

147
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:07,509
EVERY -- I MEAN SINGAPORE IS

148
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:08,376
SPECTACULARLY SUCCESSFUL.

149
00:04:08,376 --> 00:04:10,078
HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST

150
00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:11,279
G.D.P. PER CAPITA IN THE

151
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:11,580
WORLD.

152
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,615
IF YOU ARE AN OLD SCHOOL

153
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:14,649
IMPERIALIST LIKE ME, YOU

154
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:16,651
THINK THAT'S ALL DOWN TO

155
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:18,587
RAFFLES AND IF YOU ARE MORE

156
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:19,754
RECENT VINTAGE, YOU WOULD

157
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:27,195
THINK IT WAS LEE QUAN LU.

158
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:28,697
WHOEVER YOU GIVE CREDIT TO,

159
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:29,998
SINGAPORE IS A HUGELY

160
00:04:29,998 --> 00:04:32,467
SUCCESSFUL SOCIETY.

161
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:35,103
AND SO WHEN A DICTATOR OF A

162
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:36,638
BASKET CASE OF A COUNTRY

163
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:38,440
WITH BARELY DETECTABLE

164
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,808
G.D.P. THAT MAKES NOTHING

165
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:41,676
THAT ANYBODY NEEDS EXCEPT

166
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:45,313
CHEAP KNOCK-OFF VIAGRA WHICH

167
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:46,681
I HOPE PERFORMS RATHER

168
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:47,882
BETTER THAN THEIR NUCLEAR

169
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:52,153
WEAPONS DO.

170
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:54,589
BUT THAT GUY IS GETTING A

171
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:56,191
GLIMPSE OF HOW MODERN

172
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,691
SOCIETIES WORK.

173
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:58,526
AND THE INVITATION TO HIM

174
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:00,128
REALLY IS TO SAY WELL,

175
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:01,096
OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT YOU

176
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:02,230
KILLED ALL THESE PEOPLE,

177
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,801
HAVE YOU STARVED ALL THESE

178
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:08,203
PEOPLE AND THE CARROT FOR

179
00:05:08,203 --> 00:05:09,170
YOU IS THAT YOUR SOCIETY

180
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,805
COULD BE LIKE EVERY OTHER

181
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:15,243
SOCIETY IN THAT CORNER OF

182
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:16,544
THE WORLD IT COULD BE HUGELY

183
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:17,712
SUCCESSFUL AND YOU WOULD

184
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:18,480
LIVE BETTER.

185
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,450
EVEN DICTATORS LIVE BADFULLY

186
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,485
DYSFUNCTIONAL SOCIETIES.

187
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:25,954
THE ELECTRICAL SUPPLY IN THE

188
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:27,289
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE IN

189
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:28,590
PYONGYANG ISN'T MORE

190
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,991
RELIABLE THAN THE ELECTRICAL

191
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:31,393
SUPPLY ANYWHERE ELSE.

192
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:32,093
>> Tucker: WHAT DO YOU THINK

193
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:36,398
HE THINKS WHEN HE LANDS IN A

194
00:05:36,398 --> 00:05:44,005
CHINESE 747 SINGAPORE DO YOU

195
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:45,974
THINK IT SHAKES HIS FAITH.

196
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:47,075
>> THIS IS THE INTERESTING

197
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:47,442
QUESTION.

198
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:48,610
I DON'T THINK THIS GUY IS A

199
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,912
MAD MAN AND I DON'T THINK

200
00:05:50,912 --> 00:05:56,318
HER HEREDITARY DICK SHARE

00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:57,452
THESHIP SURVIVE OVER THREE

202
00:05:57,452 --> 00:06:00,055
GENERATIONS WITHOUT A SENSE

203
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,289
OF SELF-PRESERVATION.

204
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:02,691
THE SELF-PRESERVATION IS

205
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,292
MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY

206
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:06,661
IDEOLOGICAL COMMITMENT.

207
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:08,630
BASICALLY MARXISM AS KARL

208
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,231
MARX DEVELOPED IT IN THE

209
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:11,299
19TH CENTURY WAS SUPPOSED TO

210
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:13,968
IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE

211
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:17,605

.YOU CAN'T CONTROL THEM IF

226
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:24,846
YOU HAVE A FREQUENT SOCIETY

227
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:26,815
IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED

228
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,884
TO LIVE LIVES THAT FULFILL

229
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:31,619
THEIR POTENTIAL HE IS NOT A

230
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:35,156
MARXIST IN THE SENSE OF AN

231
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:42,163
ECONOMIC 240ER

232
00:06:42,163 --> 00:06:42,197
ECONOMIC D40ER

233
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:42,230
ECONOMIC DICER

234
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,630
ECONOMIC DICTATOR.

235
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,598
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

236
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:44,899
WHEN HE IS LOOKING AT

237
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:46,067
SINGAPORE, THE QUESTION IS

238
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,603
WHETHER HE CAN MAKE THE LEAP

239
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:50,238
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO LOOK THAT

240
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:50,505
FAR.

241
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:51,940
HE CAN LOOK AT SOUTH KOREA.

242
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,575
BUT HE IS ACTUALLY WALKING

243
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,343
AROUND IN WHAT A FUNCTIONING

244
00:06:55,343 --> 00:06:56,511
SOCIETY LOOKS LIKE.

245
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,445
THAT'S WHAT HE WAS DOING

246
00:06:57,445 --> 00:07:01,616
LAST NIGHT.

247
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:03,852
AND THAT FOR HIM IS A FIRST.

248
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:05,153
IT'S DIFFERENT FROM

249
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:06,054
SWITZERLAND BECAUSE IT'S

250
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:10,258
CLOSER TO HOME AND THEY DID

251
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:11,926
IT IN EVEN LESS TIME.

252
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:13,161
I THINK SINGAPORE HAS A LOT

253
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:15,130
TO DO WITH STANFORD RAFFLES

254
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:15,830
AND ALL OF THAT IF YOU

255
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,799
HAPPEN TO THINK IT'S ALL TO

256
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:20,268
DO WITH LEE KWAN LU.

257
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:21,636
LEE DID THAT IN LESS TIME.

258
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:23,772
HE HAS DONE IT IN WHAT IS IT

259
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:24,639
NOW 55 YEARS.

260
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,642
SO HE HAS ACTUALLY BUILT

261
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:31,579
THAT SOCIETY BUILT MODERN

262
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,748
SINGAPORE IN LESS TIME THAN

263
00:07:33,748 --> 00:07:35,049
THE KIM HAS DRIVEN NORTH

264
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:35,350
KOREA.

265
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,050
THEY HAVE BEEN RUNNING THAT

266
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,619
NOW FOR AN EXTRA, WHATEVER

267
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:39,254
IT IS, 10 YEARS ON THAT.

268
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:40,522
THEY HAVE ACTUALLY DRIVEN

269
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:41,890
THAT JOINT INTO THE GROUND.

270
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,391
THIS IS WHAT CAN YOU DO IF

271
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:46,561
YOU ARE ACTUALLY BUILDING A

272
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:48,997
SOCIETY.

273
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:50,432
>> Tucker: FIRST THING LEE

274
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:53,134
KWAN DLU WAS OEA TO

275
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:53,701
ELIMINATE CORRUPTION.

276
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:55,837
WHICH MIGHT BE A STUMBLING

277
00:07:55,837 --> 00:00:00,000
BLOCK FOR THE KIM REGIME.
