we can conclude I think that Christine Ford's testimony is not worthy of belief nevertheless the Democrats are doubling down so they don't believe all women because they don't believe Rachel Mitchell but I believe I believe women who should be believed that's my that's my hashtag it's not it's it's a little long it's a little clunky when it comes out of the mouth but I I definitely believe Rachel Mitchell it's amazing too because it's I never said I believe all women why would I don't believe all I don't believe Hillary Clinton don't you know if they're a lot of women I don't believe I don't believe Tawana Brawley I don't believe Jackie Coakley I don't believe a lot of women but Democrats the one who say we have to believe all women and then they turn around and friend obviously Karen Monahan Juanita Broderick anyone who is a victim of an assault or at alleges being the victim of an assault at the hands of a Democrat they don't believe them Karen Montana's medical records it's a lot better than whatever doctor Ford is spinning her story this week but I do believe Rachel Mitchell she she gives a lot of evidence she goes through it very methodically I believe it so I'm convinced less and less by the day that dr. Ford is telling the truth whether she's lying I don't know whether she's crazy I don't know whether she's mistaken I don't know whether memory changes over 30 years sure of course it does but I'm less convinced by the day and I think America is - I really do I mean they're gonna wait now with this FBI investigation they're gonna wait for more crazies to come out of the woodwork and say that you know Brett Kavanaugh abducted them in the late 70s and took them to you know Planet Zebulon seven or something but I don't I don't really buy it I don't think this is playing well with the American people this is also a lesson to conservatives because a lot with this allegation and with other allegations conservatives are so desperate to be the good guys because very often it's conservatives who were talking about virtue the left virtue signals but the right talks about virtue itself and they kind of a shoe the Saul Alinsky Machiavellian politics in immorality in politics as a principle so we want to be the good guys we want to be seen as the good guys we want to believe people we want to assume good intentions maybe we shouldn't maybe we should be a little more skeptical sometimes because I heard a lot of people saying a lot of nice things about Christine Ford even during the hearings even after it was clear that her story was changing even after the political influences were clear even after it was clear that Feinstein gave her a lawyer even after all things started but they kept saying oh well I don't know she seems like a good person I don't know maybe she's a good person maybe she's not but we should maybe be a little harder edged about these things so one of the reasons that people took Christine Ford seriously is that she's a distinguished professor she's a professor at Palo Alto college so clearly she couldn't be a crazy person because no crazy people ever go into academia right that never happens
