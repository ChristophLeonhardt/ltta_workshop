1
00:00:00,521 --> 00:00:02,223
Switching to Allstate
is worth it.

2
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:19,240
>> WE MADE THE POINT THAT MUCH

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,541
OF THE NEWS AMERICANS ARE TOLD

4
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,077
IS FACTUAL TURNS OUT TO BE

5
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:24,879
PROPAGANDA.

6
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,379
HUMAN BEINGS LIE.

7
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,280
POWERFUL PEOPLE TEND TO RELY

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,282
QUITE A BIT IN ORDER TO PROTECT

9
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:30,184
THEIR PREROGATIVES.

10
00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:31,586
JOURNALISTS OF THE ABILITY TO

11
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:34,856
RESEARCH SHAPE PERCEPTION ARE

12
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:35,723
ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO

13
00:00:35,723 --> 00:00:36,157
DISHONESTY.

14
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:36,858
THERE IS NOTHING CONTROVERSIAL

15
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:37,258
ABOUT THAT.

16
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:39,760
IT'S TRUE.

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,863
YET MAYBE NOT SURPRISINGLY, A

18
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:44,165
LOT OF REPORTERS FOUND IT DEEPLY

19
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:46,334
OFFENSIVE.

20
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:47,902
REPORTER AT "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

21
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:49,537
CALLED IT "REPUGNANT."

22
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:51,672
HE SAID IT'S "LITERALLY DAMAGING

23
00:00:51,672 --> 00:00:52,940
TO OUR DEMOCRACY THAT ANYONE

24
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,609
WOULD DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF HIS

25
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:57,745
NEWSPAPER."

26
00:00:57,745 --> 00:00:58,546
QUESTION "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

27
00:00:58,546 --> 00:00:59,780
THAT AMERICA FALLS APART.

28
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,681
PRETTY FUNNY.

29
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:01,382
IN OTHER NEWS, CARRIER HAS

30
00:01:01,382 --> 00:01:06,220
ANNOUNCED IT'S IMMORAL TO NOT

31
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,388
USE AIR CONDITIONING.

32
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:08,189
AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE, THE

33
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,260
OPPOSITE IS TRUE.

34
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,462
SKEPTICISM IS NOT UNPATRIOTIC.

35
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:15,763
IT'S YOUR DUTY.

36
00:01:15,763 --> 00:01:16,464
PRINCIPLED QUESTIONS DON'T

37
00:01:16,464 --> 00:01:17,465
DESTROY DEMOCRACY.

38
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:18,332
THEY SUSTAIN IT.

39
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:19,600
PEOPLE IN CHARGE DON'T LIKE TO

40
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,169
BE SECOND-GUESSED AND WHY WOULD

41
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:22,536
THEY?

42
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:24,071
A SKEPTICAL POPULATION MAKES

43
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:24,772
THEIR LIVES MORE COMPLETED.

44
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:26,374
THEY WOULD LIKE YOU TO SWALLOW

45
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:27,608
YOUR MEDICINE WITHOUT COMPLAINT.

46
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:28,576
SHUT UP AND OBEY.

47
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,210
DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.

48
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:29,977
EXCEPT WHAT YOU ARE TOLD AND GET

49
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:31,679
BACK TO WORK.

50
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:34,782
THAT'S A LOT TO ASK.

51
00:01:34,782 --> 00:01:35,983
ESPECIALLY COMING FROM

52
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:36,617
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" WHERE

53
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:37,351
THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTING

54
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:38,185
DETAIL IN THAT NEWSPAPER

55
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:39,754
DAY-TO-DAY AND GOOD FOR THEM FOR

56
00:01:39,754 --> 00:01:40,354
PRINTING IT.

57
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:42,290
BUT THERE'S ALSO AN AWFUL LOT OF

58
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,358
LYING, ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE BIG

59
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:45,559
THINGS.

60
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:46,527
REMEMBER WHEN

61
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:47,228
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" SPENT AN

62
00:01:47,228 --> 00:01:48,362
ENTIRE YEAR ASSURING US THAT

63
00:01:48,362 --> 00:01:50,731
SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD WEAPONS OF

64
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:51,232
MASS DESTRUCTION?

65
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:53,901
WE WENT TO WAR OVER IT.

66
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:54,969
MANY THOUSANDS DIED, AND IT WAS

67
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:56,370
A LIE.

68
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,805
HOW ABOUT WHEN THE TIMES TOLD US

69
00:01:57,805 --> 00:02:00,141
BARACK OBAMA'S TOPPLING OF

70
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:02,343
MUAMMAR QADDAFI WOULD TURN LIBYA

71
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:03,144
INTO "A PRODUCTIVE PARTNER WITH

72
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:04,578
THE WEST."

73
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:06,881
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO KNOW

74
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:08,181
WHAT THE FAMILIES NOW BEING SOLD

75
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:10,151
IN LIBYA IS OPEN SLAVE MARKET

76
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:11,152
THINK OF THAT PREDICTION.

77
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:12,119
WHO CAN FORGET THIS TIMES

78
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:16,090
HEADLINE FROM THE SPRING OF 1975

79
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,059
WHEN THE KHMER ROUGE TOOK OVER

80
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:19,260
CAMBODIA.

81
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,962
"FOR MOST, A BETTER LIFE."

82
00:02:20,962 --> 00:02:22,196
A THIRD OF THE POPULATION WENT

83
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:24,065
ON TO DIE IN GENOCIDE IN

84
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:24,432
CAMBODIA.

85
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:27,301
THE TIMES HAS YET TO ISSUE A

86
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:27,702
CORRECTION.

87
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:29,437
NOWADAYS, THE TIMES IS HYPING

88
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:30,571
THE RUSSIAN HOAX TELLING US

89
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:32,073
MOSCOW IS THE GREATEST THREAT TO

90
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:33,307
THIS COUNTRY WHEN IT'S CLEARLY

91
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:33,574
NOT.

92
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:35,242
THE PAPER IS TRYING TO PROVOKE

93
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:37,712
YET ANOTHER POINTLESS WAR IN

94
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:39,380
SYRIA BY PUSHING THE CLAIM THAT

95
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,682
BASHAR AL-ASSAD GASSED HIS OWN

96
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:42,016
PEOPLE.

97
00:02:42,016 --> 00:02:43,150
AT TIMES REPORTERS PRETENSION

98
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,352
OVER SHORT AND THAT HAVE

99
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,286
HAPPENED.

100
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:47,088
THEY DON'T KNOW IT FOR CERTAIN.

101
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:47,788
THEY ARE LYING.

102
00:02:47,788 --> 00:02:49,557
WE COULD GO ON.

103
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:51,392
WE ARE NOT MAKING A PARTISAN

104
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:52,493
POINT.

105
00:02:52,493 --> 00:02:53,694
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS HARDLY

106
00:02:53,694 --> 00:02:54,962
THE ONLY POWERFUL INSTITUTION

107
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:55,963
THAT DISTORTS THE TRUTH.

108
00:02:55,963 --> 00:02:58,065
SOMEDAY SOON MAY BE THIS WEEK,

109
00:02:58,065 --> 00:02:58,966
THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE

110
00:02:58,966 --> 00:02:59,700
HOUSE MAY ANNOUNCE AN AMNESTY

111
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,602
FOR MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE

112
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:04,472
IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.

113
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:05,373
THEY WILL TELL YOU LETTING

114
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:06,640
FOREIGNERS IGNORE OUR LAWS IS

115
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,775
GOOD FOR AMERICA.

116
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:08,743
DON'T BELIEVE THEM.

117
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:10,177
THEY ARE LYING.

118
00:03:10,177 --> 00:03:11,512
OUR COUNTRY HAS CHANGED A LOT ON

119
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:13,147
THE DIVIDE IS NO LONGER BETWEEN

120
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:14,582
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WERE

121
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:15,516
GIVEN BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT.

122
00:03:15,516 --> 00:03:18,652
IT'S REALLY BETWEEN THE

123
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:19,420
INCOMPETENTS IN CHARGE AND

124
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,054
EVERYONE ELSE.

125
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:20,988
A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE HAS

126
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:24,025
BECOME RICH AND POWERFUL,

127
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:24,892
MISMANAGING THIS COUNTRY.

128
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:26,761
I HAVE WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT

129
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:27,361
THEM.

130
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:30,598
IT IS CALLED "SHIP OF FOOLS,"

131
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:31,065
OUT IN OCTOBER.

132
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:32,199
ORDER IT NOW IF YOU WANT.

133
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:35,936
IF YOU DON'T REFLEXIVELY OWE

134
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:37,371
ANYBODY OR LEGIONS OUTSIDE YOUR

135
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:38,105
IMMEDIATE FAMILY THAT INCLUDES

136
00:03:38,105 --> 00:00:00,000
THE NEWS MEDIA.
