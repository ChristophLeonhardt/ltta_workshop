00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,740
regardless of<font color="#E5E5E5"> social and cultural</font>

2
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,110
context it be safe to say that music

3
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,300
plays a very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> role in our lives</font>

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,060
it's a great form of expression and even

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,560
at times can convey even the most

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">abstract of thoughts and for that I</font>

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,060
believe music<font color="#E5E5E5"> is indeed special</font>

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,670
music is such a great form of expressing

9
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,980
emotion and consequently it connects

10
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,810
people in the masses through shared

11
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,020
experience now years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago before the</font>

12
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,660
internet had the social impact it had

13
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,850
today people would tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hang out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

14
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,950
groups of people similar interests and

15
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,520
when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to music would share music</font>

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar to what their friends were</font>

17
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,000
listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and therefore being able to</font>

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,640
listen to diversity and being<font color="#E5E5E5"> open to</font>

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,090
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> forms and genres you know that sort</font>

20
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,810
of experience was very<font color="#CCCCCC"> limited in</font>

21
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,580
today's society however<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

22
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,560
access information and connect with

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">people around the world in ways that we</font>

24
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,090
just couldn't do before we now<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

25
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,560
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share our experiences and</font>

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,869
passions further afield and thus it's

27
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:40,520
helped our music tapes become so much

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,350
more diverse and open to<font color="#E5E5E5"> new discoveries</font>

29
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,780
I'm sure there are times in life when we

30
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,000
feel a particular emotion<font color="#E5E5E5"> or we need</font>

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">help with dealing with a particular one</font>

32
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,470
and we turn to music as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution</font>

33
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,930
well keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in mind I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came up with</font>

34
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,819
a project<font color="#CCCCCC"> called what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the soundtrack</font>

35
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,730
to your soul now it's very simple and

36
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,260
it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great if you'd like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take part</font>

37
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,030
in this because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it would create</font>

38
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,610
very interesting results and perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

39
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,220
could benefit other people in the future

40
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:38,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">so let me explain how it works now all</font>

41
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,230
you need to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> post a text comment</font>

42
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,330
the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of it needs to be a</font>

43
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,600
sentence which goes I feel and then you

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">put how you're feeling a word that</font>

45
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,280
describes<font color="#E5E5E5"> your current emotion and then</font>

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,790
because and then after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hook in why</font>

47
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,190
you feel that way what recent situations

48
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,290
caused you to feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> the emotion you are</font>

49
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,290
feeling now this sentence is the

50
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,540
introduction it puts your current state

51
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">of mind in perspective for other people</font>

52
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:08,190
reading the comment so for example i

53
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,920
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> put I feel excited because tonight</font>

54
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,780
I'm meeting up with many friends or

55
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,570
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen for such a long time or you</font>

56
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,980
could say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm feeling apprehensive</font>

57
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,620
because I'm moving away from home and

58
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,390
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure if I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good at</font>

59
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,820
making new friends now the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font>

60
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,350
the comment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the soundtrack to your</font>

61
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,989
soul what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is list five</font>

62
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,260
tracks 125 starting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the artist and</font>

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,049
a song which reinforces how you're

64
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,200
feeling right now and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that is</font>

65
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,819
the soundtrack to your soul

66
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,920
well for reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've already expressed</font>

67
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,840
in the video I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe music is a great</font>

68
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,749
way to connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in situations when</font>

69
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:48,790
you have some songs that really Express

70
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,829
how you're feeling right now it's

71
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,749
because someone out there feels the same

72
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:55,060
way so now if you look down the comment

73
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,889
section and see what other people have

74
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,989
posted you may find someone who has

75
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,329
similar feelings to you or have been in

76
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,310
a similar situation if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at their</font>

77
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,409
soundtrack Weber is to do with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> music</font>

78
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:07,510
or is to do with the lyrics or perhaps

79
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,299
both you may find a connection which is

80
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,969
a comfort to know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps we are</font>

81
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:14,980
not all alone in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we all do</font>

82
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,790
have so much in common

83
00:04:30,849 --> 00:00:00,000
you
