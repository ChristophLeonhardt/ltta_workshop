this is like the perfect punch line to the entire robert muller russia collusion investigation it turns out in 2009 special counsel robert muller now investigating president Trump for colluding with the Russians himself colluded with the Russians I know I'm just as shocked as you are it is an absurd punch line I will go through this because I want to get to Dennis as quickly as we can of all of the arguments to take down the Moller investigation to stop this anti-constitutional clearly unamerican power grab here to overturn a presidential election of all of the arguments to take down this investigation this one is the best here's what happened see if you can follow this it kind of seems like a really weird sad James Bond story but with but because it's real-life government and there's a lot of just inefficiency and poor decisions that happened along the way so in 2009 robert muller was running the FBI and the FBI asked russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska for some help to help them with an operation that they were doing even the name I have to assume that Oleg is short for oligarch my guess is that is like out of a cartoon that the Russian oligarchs name is Oleg Oleg so this is a the FBI asks Oleg for some help on this operation I'm gonna call him gar key I think that's a that's another good name name for him so the FBI asked gar key they asked Deripaska to spend millions of dollars of his own money to fund an FBI backed operation to rescue a former FBI agent Robert Levinson who was captured in Iran while working for the CIA in 2007 former FBI agent now working for the CIA abducted in Iran in 2007 now it's 2009 FBI asks the Russian oligarch for help Deripaska agreed Deripaska spent millions of dollars of his own money he had meetings with the FBI he had meetings with that disgraced former FBI agent Andrew McCabe in Paris in Vienna in Budapest in Hungary in Washington DC all over the place they meet they're working together very closely now the operation worked they actually were able to locate Levinson with Vinnie photographic evidence they tracked him down in Iran they were about to go get him and then Hillary Clinton shut everything down Hillary Clinton at the time was the Secretary of State she shut everything down at the last minute who knows why maybe she didn't want to deal with the political fallout maybe she didn't want this mission to imperil her presidential ambitions who knows they were on the verge of getting him millions of dollars had been spent they had evidence that knew where he was and then he was gone the operation ended in 2011 Levinson has never been found this is 11 years now after he was captured score another failure for Hillary Clinton so this story by the way which is a punch line to the Muller investigation actually is another piece of evidence for why it's so good that we did not elect Hillary if she totally bungled this and appears to have made certain political calculations that left this guy stranded in Iran God knows where
