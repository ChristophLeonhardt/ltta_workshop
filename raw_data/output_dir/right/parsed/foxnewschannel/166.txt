>> Sandra: FOX NEWS ALERT ON
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE
ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER WITH FUSION
GPS CO-FOUNDER GLENN SIMPSON
PLEADING THE FIFTH BEFORE THE
COMMITTEE.
>> GLENN SIMPSON MATTERS, THE
CO-FOUNDER OF GPS, THE
OPPOSITION RESEARCH FIRMED THAT
RE4R50IDS ON RESEARCH FROM THE
FORMER BRITISH SPY CHRISTOPHER
STEELE AND USED IN PART TO GET
THE SURVEILLANCE WARRANT.
WE CAUGHT UP WITH SIMPSON INTO
THE SESSION AND ASKED HIM
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
DOSSIER AND WHY HE WAS TAKING
THE FIFTH.
MR. SIMPSON, WHY ARE YOU TAKING
THE FIFTH?
MR. SIMPSON, ARE YOU FACING
LEGAL OR CRIMINAL EXPOSURE?
MR. SIMPSON, WHY IS THERE A
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN YOUR
EARLIER TESTIMONY AND BRUCE OHR?
MR. SIMPSON, WHAT WAS ON THE
MEMORY STICK THAT YOU GAVE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL
BRUCE OHR IN LATE 2016?
MR. SIMPSON, WILL YOU TAKE OUR
QUESTIONS?
>> THE SESSION LASTED 45
MINUTES.
SIMPSON TOOK THE FIFTH AND
ALLOWED HIS LAWYER TO SPEAK
AFTERWARDS.
THE LAWYER TOLD REPORTERS THIS
WAS SIMPLY A POLITICAL EXERCISE
DESIGNED TO TRY AND HELP THE
PRESIDENT IN THE RUSSIA PROBE.
HE SAID IT WAS NOT A SERIOUS
INVESTIGATION.
FOX NEWS ASKED THE LAWYER SOME
POINTED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
DOSSIER AND WHAT, IN FACT, HAD
EVER BEEN VERIFIED IN THAT
DOCUMENT.
HE SEEMED A LITTLE AGITATED BY
THOSE QUESTIONS.
HERE IS THE ATTORNEY.
>> RUSSIANS TRIED TO ELECT
DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT.
IT'S BEEN PROVEN.
AND YOU ARE QUIBBLING ABOUT
WHETHER THIS LITTLE DETAIL ON
PAGE 127 WAS CORRECT OR NOT?
IT'S ABSURD.
YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS.
THE BIG PICTURE IS THAT A
FOREIGN HOSTILE POWER WAS
TRYING TO INTERFERE IN OUR
DEMOCRACY AND PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION.
>> THE LAWMAKERS WHO WERE
INSIDE THE SESSION TODAY SAID
THEY FULLY EXPECTED SIMPSON TO
TAKE THE FIFTH BUT THEIR
QUESTION IS WHETHER HE HAS A
LEGITIMATE REASON FOR DOING SO.
THEY SAID A LEGITIMATE REASON
WOULD BE THE FEAR OF CRIMINAL
PROSECUTION THAT HE COULD NOT
USE THE FIFTH IN ORDER TO AVOID
ANSWERING THEIR QUESTIONS.
>> TODAY HE INDICATE HE IS
FACING LEGAL AND CRIMINAL JEP
OPARDY FOR TAKING THE FIVE?
>> I DON'T KNOW THEY AGREED
WITH MY ASSESSMENT.
THERE HAS TO BE A CONCERN YOU
HAVE A REASONABLE APPREHENSION
OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IN
ORDER TO INVOKE IT.
AND THAT YOU CAN'T JUST INVOKE
THE FIFTH IN ORDER TO AVOID
QUESTIONS BEFORE CONGRESS.
>> THE HOUSE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION IN MANY RESPECTS
IS COMING TO A HEAD THIS WEEK.
WE HAD GLENN SIMPSON OF THE
DOSSIER AND EXPECTING THE
FORMER TOP GENERAL COUNSEL AT
THE F.B.I. THURSDAY.
THAT WILL BE A SECOND
DEPOSITION FOR JAMES A. BAKER
AND NELLY OHR ON FRIDAY.
SHE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE SHE
DID RESEARCH FOR FUSION GPS AND
HER HUSBAND, THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL, WAS USED
BY SIMPSON AS A BACK CHANNEL TO
