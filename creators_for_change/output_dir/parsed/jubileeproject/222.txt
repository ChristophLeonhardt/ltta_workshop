here at the Jubilee project we believe
that doing good is contagious and
ordinary people can do extraordinary
things
so this December we're launching the
Jubilee project twelve days of kindness
here's how it works we've come up with
twelve simple acts of kindness and
assigned them to twelve days throughout
the month of December we're asking you
believers out there to join us and
commit to participating in all 12 days
of kindness and we'll ask you to
Facebook and tweet us your photos along
the way using the hashtag Hall Talk
we can't wait to see them
the bullying with me
is that were horrible
come
breaking through the
exceeding the person
we're coming to see
things are gonna be
to let a broken heart believe that all
the worst is over it so open your eyes
learn more and sign up for the campaign
at www.ilo.org/decentwork eyeness can do
unimaginable wonders for those that need
it the most this holiday season Merry
Christmas and Happy New Year's to you
