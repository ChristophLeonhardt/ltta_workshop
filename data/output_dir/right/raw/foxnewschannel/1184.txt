1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,322
REMARKABLY WE HAVE DISCOVERED IT

2
00:00:02,322 --> 00:00:03,323
IS STILL GOING ON.

3
00:00:03,323 --> 00:00:05,158
YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS.

4
00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:05,926
WE HAVE NO EXCLUSIVE INFORMATION

5
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:08,328
FOR YOU IN JUST A MINUTE.

6
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:10,130
AT FIRST, A REMARKABLE INTERVIEW

7
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:10,931
WITH FORMER

8
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:11,531
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.

9
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:13,166
FOR DECADES AS HE WATCHED BOTH

10
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,835
CLINTON'S HAD LICENSE TO DO

11
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:15,602
ESSENTIALLY WHATEVER THEY WANTED

12
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:16,970
TO DO AND THEY DID.

13
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:17,704
FELLOW DEMOCRATS WOULDN'T

14
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:19,739
CRITICIZE THEM AND NEITHER WITH

15
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:21,341
THEIR OBEDIENT TOADIES IN THE

16
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:21,641
MEDIA.

17
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:23,543
THE CLINTONS RAN THE DEMOCRATIC

18
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:24,578
PARTY, SO THEY WERE TOO

19
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:25,245
IMPORTANT TO BE HELD

20
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:25,645
ACCOUNTABLE.

21
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:28,181
THAT HAS CHANGED.

22
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:28,949
BILL CLINTON IS NOT POLITICALLY

23
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:29,716
IRRELEVANT SO THERE IS NO LONGER

24
00:00:29,716 --> 00:00:31,384
ANY REASON TO PROTECT HIM.

25
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:33,320
THE MEDIA SMELL BLOOD.

26
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,222
HERE FOR EXAMPLE IS WHAT

27
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:35,889
HAPPENED WHEN BILL CLINTON

28
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:36,590
VISITED THE TODAY SHOW THIS

29
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,559
MORNING TO SELL A NEW BOOK.

30
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:40,961
THE CONVERSATION WENT DIRECTLY

31
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:41,561
TO MONICA LEWINSKY.

32
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:41,862
WATCH.

33
00:00:41,862 --> 00:00:43,897
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T APOLOGIZE TO

34
00:00:43,897 --> 00:00:44,531
HER.

35
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:50,971
>> I HAVE NOT TALKED TO HER.

36
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:54,207
I HAVE NEVER TALKED TO HER, BUT

37
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:55,408
I DID SAY PUBLICLY ON MORE THAN

38
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:57,477
ONE OCCASION THAT I WAS SORRY.

39
00:00:57,477 --> 00:00:59,379
>> Tucker: OUCH.

40
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:00,647
HE ALMOST LOST IT AND THEN SORT

41
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:01,748
OF RECOVERED AND THEN HE WENT ON

42
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:03,283
TO EXPLAIN THAT EVEN THOUGH

43
00:01:03,283 --> 00:01:04,284
MONICA LEWINSKY'S LIFE WAS

44
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:06,119
COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY THAT

45
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,387
EXPERIENCE WHILE HE HIMSELF WENT

46
00:01:07,387 --> 00:01:08,655
ON TO BECOME THE SINGLE RICHEST

47
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:11,391
FORMER PRESIDENT IN HISTORY, HE

48
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:12,125
SOMEHOW IS THE REAL VICTIM HERE.

49
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,927
WATCH THIS.

50
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:18,131
>> DO YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY OR

51
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:19,332
FEEL MORE RESPONSIBILITY?

52
00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:24,337
>> NO, I FELT TERRIBLE THEN.

53
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:25,071
NOBODY BELIEVES THAT I GOT OUT

54
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:27,340
OF THAT FOR FREE.

55
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:27,908
I LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE

56
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:32,779
$50 MILLION IN DEBT.

57
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:37,951
YOU ARE GIVING ONE SIDE.

58
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:40,387
>> MR. PRESIDENT, I'M NOT --

59
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:42,522
>> DO YOU THINK

60
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:45,125
PRESIDENT KENNEDY SHOULD RESIGN?

61
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,126
DO BELIEVE PRESIDENT JOHNSON

62
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:49,963
SHOULD HAVE RESIGNED?

63
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:50,630
>> SOMEONE SHOULD ASK THESE

64
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,631
QUESTIONS TO YOU BECAUSE OF THE

65
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:52,532
WAY YOU FORMULATE THESE

66
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:52,933
QUESTIONS.

67
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:54,734
>> Tucker: IT WENT ON LIKE

68
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:55,535
THAT, IT'S PATHETIC.

69
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:56,569
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR BILL

70
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:57,837
CLINTON'S LIFE AS A PUBLIC

71
00:01:57,837 --> 00:01:58,338
FIGURE.

72
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:00,040
IT IS OVER, BUT WHAT DO THE REST

73
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,408
OF US LEARNED FROM WATCHING ALL

74
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:02,008
OF THIS?

75
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:04,344
IF YOU ARE A PROGRESSIVE LEADER

76
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:05,745
THE LESSON PROBABLY IS DON'T

77
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:06,579
ABUSE WOMEN ORDER TREAT PEOPLE

78
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:07,714
AROUND HER LIKE YOU WOULD LIKE

79
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:09,382
TO BE TREATED, RELATIVELY FEW

80
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:10,750
ELECTED DEMOCRATS COULD LIVE UP

81
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,785
TO THOSE STANDARDS.

82
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:14,154
THE QUESTION IS THIS, DON'T LOSE

83
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:14,554
POWER.

84
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:16,756
AS LONG AS YOU ARE USEFUL TO THE

85
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:17,457
LEFT, NOTHING YOU DO WILL BE

86
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:18,358
HELD AGAINST YOU.

87
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:20,160
YOU COULD LITERALLY, I DON'T

88
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,127
KNOW, DRIVE OFF A BRIDGE AND

89
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:22,162
KILL A WOMAN IN A DRUNK DRIVING

90
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:24,831
ACCIDENT AND STILL REMAIN THE

91
00:02:24,831 --> 00:00:00,000
MOST ADMIRED DEMOCRATIC
