but I could tell the most meaningful thing to him was just being listened to Johnny Martin has been knocking on doors in Mesa just east of Phoenix for weeks the 25 year old Democrat has long been a community activist is openly bisexual and converted to Islam several years ago he's also one of a growing number of first-time candidates who happens to be Muslim I want to put all of that emphasis on my policies on saving our schools on giving our teachers competitive pay on banning private prison contracts in Arizona these are the things that are really important to me hopefully someone will just get used to the fact that I'm also a queer Muslim but that's not what this campaign is about across the u.s. other Muslim Americans are getting involved in politics Abdul else aides bid for governor of Michigan gained a lot of attention but he's far from alone I think representative Athena Sulman says it's partly a reaction to hateful rhetoric coming from the White House we tried to ride under the radar and we're still on the menu and we're still being attacked so now we have to step forward and we have to step up and actually actively insert our own voice and our own truth into the conversation because the other alternative was not working in Arizona Muslims make up about 1% of the state's population making political inroads here won't be easy but some residents are ready to embrace candidates like Johnny we need people like that who honest people instead of crooks who just for themselves that's how it was me like that was so long they need to change and if you could do it got a blessing man you know if the unwritten goal of the Trump administration's anti-muslim rhetoric is to scare people away from public life it seems to be backfiring from school boards to Congress Muslims are running for public office in unprecedented numbers for his part Johnny Martin says his religion has very little to do with his political ambitions but how people vote for these candidates in the coming months will be very telling hi I'm Johnny Martin as part of his civic duties Johnny Martin spends time talking about his faith he says he wants to help break down stereotypes but is ultimately more interested in politics than religion and the Gallacher aljazeera Mesa Arizona
