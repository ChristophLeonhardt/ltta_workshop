TO THEIR WORKS, STAY TUNED. Shannon: IT IS A VERY BIG TOPIC. WE WILL STAY ALIVE FOR THAT IN THE MORNING. GARRETT TENNEY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT LETS GO TO CONGRESSMAN ANDY BIGS. HE'S VERY INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF THESE REQUESTS. THANKS SO MUCH GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US TONIGHT. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE CHAIRMAN REQUESTED. THE MAN THAT JAMES COMEY SENT THE CONTENTS OF HIS MEMO TO. THEY WANT TO KNOW ALL THE RECIPIENTS OF THE COMEY MEMOS. THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT RICHMAN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FBI BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND HE DID HAVE SOME RELATIONSHIP AND DOING SOME WORK FOR THEM. THEY WANT TO KNOW HIS SECURITY LEVEL. THE ACCESS THAT RICHMAN HAD TO THE DOJ AND FBI, THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH OTHER EMPLOYEES. TODAY WAS THE DEADLINE. THEY DON'T PHYSICALLY, WE UNDERSTAND, HAVE THE DOCUMENTS BUT A PHONE CALL ABOUT WHEN THEY MAKE ON. THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING AS WELL, AN ORAL PROMISE, ANOTHER PROMISE MADE TO GET THESE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. IS ANYBODY SURPRISED BY THAT? THAT HAS KIND OF BEEN THE M.O. HERE. THAT'S THE PATTERN, WE MIGHT GET IT TO YOU AND THEN WHEN THEY GET IT TO YOU IT MAY BE WRITTEN BUT IT'S HIGHLY REDACTED AS WELL. WE ARE THEN SAYING NO CLEAR UP THE REDACTION, WHY DID YOU REDACT AND THIS IS A CIRCULAR SWEEP HERE THAT KEEPS GOING ON AND ON AND IT'S VERY DISHEARTENING. Shannon: OKAY SO THE RANKING DEMOCRAT ON THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS SAID THIS. THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER, THE G.O.P., TO DISTRACT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGAL TROUBLE AND DISCREDIT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS A HEDGE AGAINST THE NEXT ROUND OF INDICTMENTS. INCORPORATED ABOUT ALL OF THE GOOD OUR COMMITTEE MIGHT BE DOING INSTEAD. THINK YOUR RESPONSE? THAT'S WRONG ON ABOUT THREE LEVELS. FIRST OF ALL, THE REASON THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS LEGAL TROUBLES IS BECAUSE THE DOJ WRONGFULLY SET A WHOLE LITANY, ALL TIMELINE PATTERN OF INVESTIGATING PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE WAS A CANDIDATE, INVESTIGATING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WHEN JERRY SAID THAT WE COULD BE DOING OTHER THINGS, NAME ONE. WE TRY TO DO IMMIGRATION AND THEY PUT THE BRAKES FOR THAT. IF YOU GO BACK FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WHEN I WAS ON JUDICIARY COMMITTEE YOU WILL HEAR JERRY ADLER AND HIS COLLEAGUES, EVERY TIME WE WOULD TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION, NAVY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, EVERYTHING WAS ON RUSSIAN COLLUSION AND NOW THEY ARE MOM ON THAT BECAUSE THE ONLY POLLUTERS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WITH THE FBI HONCHOS. Shannon: WE ARE A YEAR INTO THE SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION. WE FED FOLKS SPEAKING OUT FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE SAYING THERE'S NO CONCRETE HARD EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION. A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SAY THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANTIAL THINGS, BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INDICTMENTS BUT THEY HAVE BEEN ABOUT CRIMES THAT AREN'T RELATED TO COLLUSION. THINGS ABOUT LYING TO A FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR OR FINANCIAL CRIMES THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THESE FOLKS WERE CONNECTED IN ANY WAY TO THE PRESIDENT. WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NEXT IS THAT MR. ROSENSTEIN SHOULD BE DIRECTED BY HIS BOSS, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, TO PULL THE PLUG ON THIS INVESTIGATION, WHICH AS YOU'VE SAID Shannon: CAN HE? HAVING BEEN RECUSED. YOU ARE THE GUY SUPPOSED BE RUNNING THIS, LET'S MAKE IT WORK. MR. ROSENSTEIN PROBABLY SHOULD GO. I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED HE SHOULD GO. BUT MUELLER IS CLEARLY OUTSIDE HIS BOUNDS. WE ARE TALKING MANAFORT FROM EIGHT YEARS AGO. WE ARE TALKING PAPADOPOULOS HAS NOTHING REALLY TO DO WITH THIS. THEY THEMSELVES HAVE AGREED, EVERYBODY WHO HAS LOOKED AT THE SAID THERE'S NO COLLUSION HERE BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIAN INFLUENCE. THAT MEANS YOUR PURPOSE IS GONE, PULL THE PLUG, BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT BECAUSE ROSENSTEIN WON'T GIVE US THE SCOPE LETTER. Shannon: WHICH OUTLINES WHAT AUTHORITY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL HAS TO LOOK INTO THINGS. IT'S HEAVILY REDACTED. I KNOW YOU HOPE YOU WILL GET IT. DO YOU BELIEVE YOU WILL GET IT ON REDACTED?
