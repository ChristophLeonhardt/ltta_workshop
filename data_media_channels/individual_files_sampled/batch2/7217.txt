you knew that it was coming as soon as it turned out that the shooter in southern Springs was a white guy you knew where the conversation was going to go it only took a little bit of time and then Donald Trump brought it there let's watch I think that mental health is your problem here this was a very based on preliminary reports very deranged individual a lot of problems over a long period of time we have a lot of mental health problems in our country as do other countries but this isn't a guns situation I mean we could go into it but it's a little bit soon to go into it but fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction otherwise it would have been as bad as it was it would have been much worse but this is a mental health problem at the highest level it's a very very sad event it's a these are great people and a very very sad event but that's the way I view it every single one of you could have scripted that out as soon as you saw the details about the shooting it's not a gun this thing it's a mental health thing it's always a mental health thing here and you know the cons let's not let's just slow down a little bit that same guy that you just saw in that video was talking about banning travel from the Middle East so fast that his advisors hadn't yet clued him into the idea that was Beck Stan isn't in the Middle East at that point and then he wanted to shut down the entire diversity Visa Lottery program that night okay but this is a do to like let's not go crazy let's not go crazy I mean this is just the worst year for mass shootings in US history but let's not go crazy and you know you can say well it doesn't really matter what Trump says and certainly he says a lot of stuff where you really hope it doesn't matter but here because we are looking for you know he could really he could make a real name for himself here in a good way I mean this is a guy who is just a adhesive he's an abomination right but he could really do something you've said yeah we really have to examine this and I'm gonna call on congressional leadership but he's wedded to the talking points as John says he knows what he has to say and so he says it and gets into this mental health Jam and yet the truth is not the mental health thing wouldn't have kept this guy out of owning a gun Texas yeah and I mean you're right this is actually an opportunity for him I mean like with all of the other interests the the big financial interests and all that but he's tied in with he doesn't need the NRA and if he were to do something he would at least make it a like give me a moment of pause like oh my god this dude banned these guns again like oh that would actually be a point of spectrum maybe he's reasonable he could try to do that you might say well his base would have been in him and I think that prior to Trump that's possible man they love their guns but they now believe that this is their Dear Leader if he told them that assault weapons were bad they'd be throwing him on a pile to burn the next day that's exactly right for good for once yes it's that cult of personality and John is right he could sell a glass of water to a drowning man this guy when that drowning man is one of his base you know and and it's true and without even having to actually craft legislation because of course he's out of the next thing next photo op but even just some empty rhetoric from Trump that wasn't off those NRA talking points would have been welcomed and by the way want to clarify something when I talk about the mental health thing in relation to the shooter in Texas what I'm talking about is his domestic violence his dishonorable discharge none of that would have put him in a category of being in a mental health situation that wouldn't still have allowed him to buy a gun yeah I just want to be clear about that so you can get away with a lot before they continue can consider you mentally ill to the point that they won't allow you to buy a gun in Texas that's true and look we've been through this enough times we know that bringing up the mental health thing is just a distraction to try to get you to not push for any actual change in the wake of a tragedy there's no reason why we need to treat it seriously this this idea but let's let's treat it seriously anyway because we like to do that if it is a mental health problem in this country and you keep saying that over and over again then why did this happen bring up bring up this graphic why did earlier this year Trump sign a bill revoking Obama era gun checks for people with mental illnesses like we're not even at a point where I'm trying to get you to do something about the mental illness that you think is the problem I'm trying to get you to stop taking away the little that we've done previously you're moving in wrong direction Trump if we are to believe that you're actually being honest which we know probably is the case that rule by the way if you don't remember this incident added people receiving Social Security checks for mental illnesses and people deemed unfit to handle their own financial affairs to the national background check database now look there's there's legitimate concerns over how exactly that would be used and you know who might fall under it I understand that safeguards need to be in place but that was like the one little step we took in the right direction and he took that away so don't give me any that mental health problems if you're not gonna go into dangerous terrorist territory there I feel like if there's a mental health is really the problem here it's us it's all of us as a country we are fucked up in some particular way that stops us from protecting our own lives we just become wedded to these ideals and the and so wedded that there's a whole and it's a substantial segment of population that is falling in line with the talking points of the NRA and they have bought this sort of constitutional patriotism which has been perverted I mean it's sort of like the Bible you know where you think well I guess there's some good stuff in there and the best thing about the Bible is that I can reshape it and you know pop out a quote to justify anything I want and that's the same thing that's happened with the constitutional and constitutional rights on guns and so as we sit here with these guns that were never could have been foreseen by the founding fathers I mean even if you accept the Constitution as a document that's not living and breathing and of course it is a document that's living and breathing that's why it's amended and changed and modified you still have trouble squaring the document with what's going on now and the kinds of weapons that people are toting around exactly and and again like I know a lot of like a lot of conservatives across the country like people who are just they they feel like they're being fair and they feel like it's what could it be it's got to be the mental health okay if it was mental health if the guns are irrelevant and it's just crazy people that would have done it anyway then where are all of Britain's crazy people and where are all the crazy people in Israel and why is it that Europe is so goddamn free of crazy people why is it that you only seem to go crazy in America for some reason in a way that ends up with dozens of people being killed that's weird we should look into that at some point as a country isn't that bizarre that were the only people that go crazy around the world maybe it's in our water maybe it's the stuff that's turning all the frogs gay maybe it also makes us go crazy I don't know I'll look into it yeah if you look at the formula it's clear that the one variable in the formula is the ownership of guns and yeah and look you can be for the ownership of guns for a personal weapon for protection of your home or whatever but you've got to concede that these automatic weapons or semi-automatic weapons that are then converted to effectively be automatic weapons you've got to concede that they're not needed in even to defend your home I mean I don't know what your home looks like but when do you need to spray the whole place with 200 bullets you just don't need to do it it makes no sense these things just don't square with the facts yeah and look people who take home defense seriously know that you would never use something like an air for home defense anyway because the penetration means that it's likely to go through the walls of a house and kill either members of your family or innocent bystanders that's why you use lower caliber weapons things like shotguns possibly because it's literally safer for your family in a home defense situation similar issues for hunting like it's just it's just BS we all know ok you'll like them cuz they're cool and I'll even grant you that like I probably am more interested in guns than anyone else in this building I think they're cool too but I don't need to own one and just admit it it's because they're awesome and understand the consequences of you feeling that they're awesome is that you think that it's OK for 30 or 40 or 50 people to routinely be gunned down because you want to be able to go and think that that's cool and that's fine maybe we're just living you know what a sick fucking country we live in lots of stuff is cool I don't kill people for and me having access to it doesn't necessitate that other people need to die and the other people part of that and this is where the shoe can pinch for everybody it's not always the other people you can end up these people are in a church in Texas probably a lot of them support gun owners rights in that community you can end up being a victim of it all of us can be end up being victims of this stuff when you walk into a pub where yeah you walk into a public place now an American you're going nowhere the exits just in case you know I know it's it's taken away our innocence and as John says it makes absolutely no sense it is just this hey man isn't this cool I've got a gun that's why you see people on Facebook with guns that's why the video of people shooting with guns it's this aura around gun ownership or having a gun or using a gun but the truth is there is no inoculation from gun violence you can become a victim even as you support this constitutional right to own an AR yeah and the final point I'll make on this is something we're talking about in the wake of the New York attack we're very often we need to find out what sort of attack it was so that we know exactly what the the narrative coming out of it is and we said after New York there's something we can do that would help with both cases when it's you know a crazy gun lover who looks much more like me than he does like Osama bin Laden or if it's somebody who has pledged to Isis if we invest in some sort of effort here in America to try to detect and to stop radicalization of all kinds that will help with all sorts of attacks and not only is Trump not doing that something that would be so easy to do and would be greeted with applause from liberals and conservatives but he defunded the few organizations in this country that we're doing that he took away the grants to non-governmental organizations that were trying to stop people from being radicalized not only are we not doing anything to protect ourselves but we are literally disarming ourselves against some of the the highest profile threats that we've seen since Trump became president but quickly a note these mass shootings that we're talking about probably have nothing to do with radicalization of any kind these are deranged people result of domestic dispute angry at my girlfriend wife fill in the blank we still don't really know what produced the lust anger and and and all of that carnage so etc these are people who weren't even radicalized this has nothing to do with Islam a religion at least best as we can see I mean the only religious part of this latest carnage is that it happened in a church so it you know we'll see what will happen see I think you identify right it's it's early in the process but I think you identify something very important which is honestly it all comes back down to we're awash in these weapons and bad shit happens if you like this clip of The Young Turks you
