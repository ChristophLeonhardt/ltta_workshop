now do you see Berkeley scene of riots and violence when Milo Annapolis was asked to speak there and Coulter was also blocked and this is the sort of scene that we saw back in February a destruction of property fires riding in the area but Ben Shapiro is determined to have his say when he goes there and they are happy to have him now that they've declared this quote free speech year wonder what happens next year or what happens last year for that matter at the institution but anyway they are insisting that the College Republicans pay 15 grand for security when Ben Shapiro speaks there and this comes days after the school's chancellor touted this new free speech initiative at Berkeley watch I believe that any attack on free speech no matter how abhorrent the views are there expressed is an attack on the right of free speech for us all there you go so now $15,000 man Ben Shapiro editor in chief of daily wire comm venom good evening good to see so what do you think about this this fee is it fair are you going to pay it and what are you gonna get for it I guess is the biggest question the young America's Foundation has already said that they're going to pay the fee as far as it being fair no I mean life isn't fair I guess that they should be providing security I'm a taxpayer in the state of California I promise you I pay much more than that in taxes to the state of California every year so I guess I gets paid for the security twice over but here's sort of what I'm telling people who want to come with a 2,000 seed stadium or auditorium that is opening up they haven't provided the link yet but you can go over to ya-ya org and you can start to reserve your seat there what I've been saying to people is don't show up ready to do battle with an Tifa we foresee that Antipa will probably show up and try to cause violence do not come ready to do violence in defense of my free speech rights we just paid so that Berkeley will do it right either Berkeley is going to protect my free speech rights or they're not now we get to see as a nation whether Berkeley is going to keep its word to protect free speech even when auntie fish shows up and the last thing that I want is some bloody battle out in the streets with people who think they're protecting my free speech rights who aren't members of the government the whole point here is that Berkeley and and their administration have to do the job they've been pledging to do you know I mean we've seen what happened here in the past and we're showing it again I think one of the biggest is whether or not that the police will intercede in some of these situations we've seen them reluctant to get in the middle of it I guess in part for fear of causing you know things to escalate even further but you see the destruction that happens when they don't 100% 100% I mean we have the situation at Cal State Los Angeles and we actually had to file a lawsuit against Cal State Los Angeles because we felt that the police have been told to stand down by the administration so this again is going to be a test of the administration is going to be a test of the police are you going to fulfill your promise to protect free speech or are you just going to sound off about it in the press and then allow an Tifa and and the far-left to do whatever they want to shut down speech with which they disagree yeah before that you go want to get one of your one thought from you on this issue of kindergarteners being taught by their teachers about the transgender issue and the parents many of them the for the Rocklin Academy School were outraged they feel it's just too young to introduce these these ideas to these children but but they really weren't asked whether or not that was okay before this happened it's despicable it's despicable I mean the fact is that when you're teaching children about issues that are sensitive like gender identity you would imagine the parents should have some say in that but there's been this newfangled attempt by the left to basically say we have to protect children from their own parents that the parents are the real obstacle here we know better than you do how to raise your own children and we're going to teach them things that are absolutely contrary to silence like boys can become girls and girls can become boys the idea that all of this is just genetically inbuilt there's no evidence to suggest that all transgender activity all gender identity orientation all of that is genetically inbuilt and has no environmental impact at all in fact most kids who identify as gender confused when they're young grow out of it as they get older and yet here you have a school that's basically saying to the parents we're going to teach our false version of science to your children and not just are we go apparently they had a transgender party for one five-year-old and talking entire class about it at the same time I mean this is really despicable stuff the idea is to protect the innocence of children not to rip it away from them in the name of five-year-olds making their own decisions about what is yeah when your kid now you're learning about all of these ideas and growing up and turning into the person that you're going to become and we have seen that it's in some of these cases encouragement to have you know to go through the process of changing your sex at such a young age this can only exacerbate those concerns among these families and for these kids as well Ben thank you we'll be watching September 14th to see how it goes good luck to you we'll see you soon thanks so much
