Donald Trump's most recent pardon beneficiary the conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza he's back on television today revealing what Donald Trump told him that he wants an exchange for the clemency he got the president said Dinesh you've been a great voice for freedom and he said that I got to tell you man to man you've been screwed he goes I've been looking at the case I knew from the beginning that it was fishy but he said upon reviewing it he felt a great injustice had been done and that using his power he was going to rectify it sort of clear the slate and he said he just wanted me to be out there to be a bigger voice than ever defending the principles that I believe in voice for freedom that's what Donald Trump says Dinesh D'Souza has been let's take a little just a little peek at what Dinesh D'Souza is actually a bit of voice for he came to prominence back in the mid 1980s he was a far-right provocateur when he was an undergrad at Dartmouth running the Dartmouth review an institution that was famous for outing gay students at the time and since then he's become infamous for a whole bunch of things in the a Obama era including some documentaries and for some inflammatory tweets like this one about former President Obama which starts with you could take the boy out of the ghetto and there's this nickname for the former president grown-up Trayvon and Dinesh D'Souza has even defended Hitler let that one sink in for just one moment but beyond the inflammatory talking points President Trump may have a different agenda in mind with his part of D'Souza who is convicted of campaign finance charges like the ones swirling around trump's fixer michael cohen may be a loud and clear message for the president's personal attorney to stay strong in the face of offers to flip or to one of his most vocal critics Preet Bharara who was the man who indicted and prosecuted D'Souza the New York Times Editorial Board sees the surprising pardon I'm an extreme conservative as part of a pattern one thing is becoming clear Donald Trump uses whatever power he has to attack the people he feels have wronged him and he will do whatever he feels he must to protect himself for him pardons are a means of vengeance those he's issued to date are only a small hint of what could be coming as the Russia investigation heats up joining us now Washington the Y from the Washington Post is the Washington Post bureau chief Phil Drucker hi Phil and joining the table maybe a Roca former US assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York now a distinguished fellow at Pace University's law school tomorrow because we quoted from that New York Times editorial I want to start with you there are a lot of things to say about these pardons and some of them were said on the show yesterday but the notion of the of the pardon as not a form of clemency not a form of forgiveness but as a form of retribution not really what the pardon was designed to serve not the function was designed to serve but it seems at least one of the things Donald Trump is doing here is trying to exact punishment on his right on his enemies absolutely I mean I think it's a great reflection of who he is and how he wants to use this presidency and when you think about the message that he we believe is sending to the folks around him who maybe under who are under investigation that's terrifying and then secondarily when you think about the message it sends morally it's repugnant it's disgusting Dinesh D'Souza as a great example of someone who I think was treated quite generously actually as a conservative intellectual but actually is essentially just a racist troll and you know I just think it's actually quite generous that's actually quite generous in and of itself right I mean I think this is this is Trump's guy yeah Joe Arpaio yeah Trump Scott so there you go Phil Rucker I want to go to you just because you got some reporter you guys are pushing this story forward among others I'm reading from a quote in your paper it says a senior White House official said that as many as a dozen other pardons are under consideration by President Trump adding that most that most are likely to happen they're going to be more said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment candidly on the issue I know you're reporting on this topic Phil I mean are we about to see a wave of Pardons and is that wave just gonna grow bigger bigger and more pointed in some ways as the Russia investigation gets closer and closer and stays on the trekked rates on closer and closer to the Oval Office I think that's right John we've seen the president really enjoy flexing his his powers of clemency he said yesterday that he was considering pardons for Martha Stewart as well as for Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich but White House officials working right behind me tell us that there are many more under consideration that the president may be may be acting in the very near future on a number of these and it's important to point out that these are not happening through the sort of normal Department of Justice process where sort of regular people can apply for a pardon and that gets consideration by the pardon attorney but rather it's the president sort of hearing about a case or reading about a case in the news or seeing it on TV or a friend and in the case of yesterday's pardon with dinesh d'souza with senator Ted Cruz of Texas who brought it to the president's attention and then the president asking his lawyers here at the White House to review those cases and prepare the paperwork for a pardon me we hear over and over again from real lawyers and some fake lawyers on TV that the pardon power is absolute the president could basically do it for whatever reason he wants is that actually true well it's absolute in the sense that yes I mean the short answer is yes it's absolute but that doesn't mean that it can't sort of form the basis of other charges against the president later and some of those have already been talked about obstruction as the main one could his could his dangling of pardons to potential witnesses if that's sort of what this is a part of could could that you know if he did in fact offer through a back-channel a pardon to Flynn could that be part of an obstruction charge and some have said it could possibly be a bribery charge you know because he's trying to bribe a witness but I think you know that part of why it's an absolute power is because no one I don't think anyone ever assumed it would be used in this way you know pardons are supposed to be about justice not about vindictiveness or personal favors and we're about obstructing justice well yeah and and you know where he's taking someone who pled guilty to a crime I mean admitted under oath that he was guilty had his arguments to the judge that this was selective prosecution and you know all of that is just being be thrown under the table hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or
