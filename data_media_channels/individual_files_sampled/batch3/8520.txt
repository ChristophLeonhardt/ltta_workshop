AND THE REFUSAL TO GIVE PEACE A CHANCE. THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S "ANGLE." REMEMBER WHEN THE LEFT WAS ALL ABOUT LOVE, PEACE, AND UNDERSTANDING? ♪♪ ALL WE ARE SAYING IS GIVE PEACE A CHANCE ♪ ♪ ♪♪ Laura: YOU REMEMBER THOSE GREAT MUSICAL NUMBERS AT THOSE NO NUKES CONCERT IN THE LATE '70s, EARLY '80s, JACKSON BROWN. THE LEFT THOUGHT WE SHOULD STOP BEING SO BELLIGERENT TOWARDS THE SOVIET UNION, WE SHOULD ENGAGE WITH THE SOVIETS ALL FOR A BETTER WORLD. SOME EVEN ADMIRED THE CASTROS IN CUBA AND THEY FORWARD WITH MARXIST IDEOLOGY HERE AT HOME. SO ONE WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT MANY OF THE SAME PEOPLE AND THEIR IDEOLOGICAL OFFSPRING WILL VIEW PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN AS A MOMENT TO SAVOR, A REAL CHANCE TO CREATE A MORE PEACEFUL PLANET. BUT NO. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? BECAUSE THE MAN IS DOING THE OUTREACH IN NEGOTIATING IS DONALD J. TRUMP. BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER HIS WHIRLWIND TRIP TO SINGAPORE FOR THE KIM MEETING COME HIS CRITICS AND BOTH PARTIES KEPT REVEALING THEMSELVES. THEIR NARRATIVES KEPT SHIFTING. SIX MONTHS AGO, IT WAS THIS: : A LACK OF STRATEGY IN MY VIEW HAS ASKED SLIDING TOWARD WAR BY NEXT SUMMER. TRUMP'S COMMENTS ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAVE EXPERTS WORRY HE COULD LITERALLY INADVERTENTLY TRIGGER A CATASTROPHE. HAS RECKLESS BEHAVIOR COULD LAUNCH THE NATION ON THE PATH WORLD WAR III. Laura: YOU ARE ALL WRONG. EVERYONE OF YOU. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO LIST YOU ALL, YOU ARE WRONG. BUT THEY TEAR ANY OF BEING WRONGED BY THE EXPERTS IS NOTHING NEW. BUT THEY WERE WRONG ABOUT THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP, THE ECONOMY OF DONALD TRUMP, THE PRO-LIFE COMMITMENT OF DONALD TRUMP, AND THE TRADE POLICIES OF DONALD TRUMP, JUST TO NAME A FEW. NATURALLY, AS THEY SUMMIT BEGAN, THE ERROR CAUCUS OFFERED THIS TRENCHANT ANALYSIS. DONALD TRUMP CAN RELATE TO AUTHORITARIANS. AS A FORMER BUSINESSMAN, HE LIKES ABSOLUTE CONTROL. IS HE A WANNABE DESPERATE? I'VE CONCEDED THAT FOR YEARS. THE MARKED WHERE MORE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NORTH KOREA, THE LESS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY. IT IS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP Laura: THAT'S ALL THEY'VE GOT, SAYS THE WOMAN WHO BROUGHT US THE WINNING CAMPAIGN OF JOHN McCAIN IN 2008? OH, OKAY. RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, THRIVING ECONOMY, TAX CUTS, DESTRUCTION OF ISIS AND A FOREIGN POLICY COUP IS ALL THEY'VE GOT. EVEN AFTER TRUMP BROUGHT KIM TO SINGAPORE, EVEN AFTER HE SQUEEZED CONCESSIONS AND AT LEAST A COMMITMENT TO DENUCLEARIZE THE KOREAN PENINSULA, THE LEFT STILL WILL NOT GIVE HIM A SHRED OF CREDIT. DONALD TRUMP, THE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER. AND HE DOESN'T REALIZE THAT THIS DICTATOR DOESN'T WANT BEACH CONDOS. HE WANTS NUCLEAR WEAPONS. EMPTY WORDS FROM A POTENTIALLY WORDS. FLAGS AND CEREMONY. DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WE HOPED FOR. ARE WE GOING TO HEAD WITH HOPEFUL WISHFUL THOUGHTS? I FIND IT INCREDIBLY WORRYING AND DEPRESSING. NO KNOWLEDGE OF HISTORY. IT IS STAGGERING TO REALIZE HOW ON SELF-AWARE AND THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. Laura: THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. I DON'T RECALL MOST OF THESE MEDIA ELITES GRIPING ABOUT EMBRACING DICTATORS WHEN BARACK OBAMA RESTORED TIES WITH THE CASTROS IN CUBA OR WHEN HE GAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE DICTATORS IN IRAN. BOGUS DENUCLEARIZATION DEAL. WHEN HE HELD A STEAK DINNER FOR THE CHINESE DICTATOR. THE SELECTIVE MORAL OUTRAGE HERE IS GALLING, PREDICTABLE, AND SO BLATANT. WHEN TRUMP TALKS TOUGH, THEY SAY HE IS A WARMONGER TAKING US TO WAR. BUT WHEN HE GETS DOWN GUYS TO SIT AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AND BEGIN TO HAMMER OUT A PIECE FRAMEWORK, HE IS SAVAGE FOR EMBRACING A DICTATOR. WHICH IS IT? THEY BEAT HIM UP FOR SAYING HE MAKE A CHANGE. BUT TRUMP HIMSELF SAID, LISTEN CAREFULLY, HE COULD BE WRONG. I THINK HONESTLY I THINK HE'S GOING TO DO THESE THINGS. I MAY BE WRONG. Laura: HE SET ALL HAVE TO COME BACK AND APOLOGIZE. I WOULD LIKE IT. EVEN WITH THE HIGH-STAKES INVOLVED, REALLY SERIOUS, POSSIBLY DEADLY CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE, PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKES GEOPOLITICS FUN AGAIN. I MAY STAND BEFORE YOU IN SIX MONTHS AND SAY HEY, I WAS WRONG. I DON'T KNOW THAT I WILL EVER ADMIT THAT BUT I WILL FIND SOME KIND OF EXCUSE. Laura: THE DOUBTERS HAD TO LAUGH A LITTLE. HAVE SOME FUN. IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE AN AMERICAN. LIKE, WHO ELSE COULD HAVE GOTTEN US TO THIS POINT? HE SAID OPENLY TO A COUPLE REPORTERS WITH HIM THAT HE KNOWS NO OTHER PRESIDENT EVER COULD HAVE DONE THIS. Laura: WELL, OKAY, SO HE'S GOT A BIG EGO. WHAT PRESIDENT DOESN'T? BIG DEAL. ISN'T TRUMP'S PATH BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE THE ELITES WERE WARNING US ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO? A NORTH KOREA THAT IS SO ISOLATED IT MIGHT THINK TO DO THE UNTHINKABLE, HIT AN AMERICAN CITY WITH AN ICBM? I SAY LET HIM DISTRACT US ALL, LET THEM KEEP GOING SLAPPING THEIR LIPS, LET THEM LIE AND CONTRADICT THEIR OWN ANALYSES. WHILE THEIR AUDIENCE AND READERSHIP SHRINKS AND THEY DO IN OUT, MORE AMERICANS I THINK ARE SEEN THROUGH THE MEDIA MANIPULATION. TRUMP, AT HOME AND ABROAD, IS
