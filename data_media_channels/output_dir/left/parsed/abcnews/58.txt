THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION
DOWN HERE.
HERE I'M ALSO SEEING SOME 
HELICOPTERS UP IN THE AIR.
A LOT OF CONFUSION DOWN HERE, 
GEORGE. 
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
REMEMBER CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE 
CORRESPONDENT BRIAN ROSS.
SOME PRELIMINARY INFORMATION 
COMING IN FROM THE NEW YORK CITY
POLICE.
THEY HAVE A SUSPECT IN CUSTODY.
IT APPEARS THIS APPEARS TO BE AN
INTENTIONAL DRIVING DOWN OF THAT
BIKE PATH.
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS 
PRECIPITATED BY ROAD RAGE.
ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK 
POLICE, THE VEHICLE CONTINUE -- 
THE SUSPECT EXITED THE VEHICLE, 
DISPLAYING IMITATION FIREARMS 
AND WAS SHOT BY THE NEW YORK 
POLICE DEPARTMENT. 
>> SHOT BY POLICE, IS ALIVE AND 
IS IN CUSTODY.
AUTHORITIES SAY THE TRUCK 
TRAVELED SOME 20 BLOCKS, MOWING 
DOWN A BICYCLIST AND HITTING 
SCHOOL BUS AS YOU REPORTED.
THIS IS ONE OF 10 OR 12 RECENT 
INCIDENTS IN WHICH VEHICLES HAVE
BEEN USED TO ATTACK.
>> AND WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS 
BEEN SOMETHING THAT ISIS HAS 
CALLED ON THEIR FOLLOWERS TO DO.
WITH NO INFORMATION, WHETHER 
THIS WAS INSPIRED BY ISIS OR 
SOMETHING ELSE.
>> THE FBI IS RESPONDING TO THE 
SCENE, SUGGESTING THERE IS MORE 
TO IT THAN ROAD RAGE. 
>> LET'S GO TO PIERRE THOMAS.
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN 
BRIEFED?
>> WELL, THEY HAVE GOTTEN SOME 
PRELIMINARY INFORMATION, GEORGE.
SOME OF THE PRELIMINARY 
INFORMATION POINTED TO ROAD 
RAGE.
BUT NOW I'M BEING TOLD BY A 
SOURCE THAT THEY'RE REASSESSING,
TRYING TO GET ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION, GIVEN THE NUMBER OF
INJURED AND DEAD.
AND REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 
WHAT PRECIPITATED THIS EVENT.
BUT THE SOURCE I JUST TALKED TO 
SAID THAT GIVEN THE LENGTH OF 
TIME THAT THE TRUCK WAS ON THE 
BIKE TRAIL, THAT THIS ACT AT 
LEAST IN PART IS INTENTIONAL.
BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE REASON 
YET. 
>> MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO OF NEW 
YORK ON HIS WAY TO THE SCENE 
RIGHT NOW.
SO IS GOVERNOR CUOMO.
LINDSEY JANICE IS IN DOWNTOWN.
>> THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS 
OF PEOPLE MEDIA, BYSTANDERS, 
SOME AMBULANCE, POLICE VEHICLES.
POLICE HAVE GOT THE STREET 
BLOCKED OFF.
WE'RE ABOUT TWO BLOCKS FROM 
WHERE THE INCIDENT HAPPENED.
WE'RE HEARING, AGAIN, AT LEAST 
SIX DEAD, PERHAPS A DOZEN 
INJURED.
I'VE JUST BEEN LOOKING AT A 
PIECE OF VIDEO THAT WAS GIVEN TO
US BY SOMEBODY WHO WITNESSED 
PART OF THIS INCIDENT.
A MAN RUNNING AROUND IN THE 
STREET, APPARENTLY RUNNING AWAY 
FROM AUTHORITIES WITH WHAT 
APPEARED TO BE SOMETHING IN HIS 
HAND.
IT APPEARED TO BE A GUN.
THAT IS ALL THE INFORMATION WE 
HAVE.
THIS VIDEO HERE, WE'RE TOLD THAT
AUTHORITIES ARE GOING TO UPDATE 
US AT 5:15 P.M. EASTERN. 
>> THERE WILL BE A POLICE 
BRIEFING.
ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, THEY'RE
SAYING HE WAS DISPLAYING A GUN.
BUT THEY'RE DESCRIBING IT AS AN 
IMITATION GUN. 
>> NOT AN OPERABLE GUN.
BUT WAS WAVING IT AROUND AND WAS
SHOT ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES IN
THE BUTTOCKS AS HE CAME OUT.
>> SO THIS IS STILL UNFOLDING 
RIGHT NOW.
WE KNOW AS WE SAID THAT SIX 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.
ABOUT 11 INJURED DOWN IN 
DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN.
THIS ALL UNFOLDED AT 
APPROXIMATELY 3:00 P.M. EASTERN 
TIME.
WHAT YOU SEE THERE IS STUYVESANT
HIGH SCHOOL.
THIS IS RIGHT IN THE VICINITY, 
GIO BENITEZ.
THERE ARE REPORTS A SCHOOL BUS 
CARRYING SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN 
WAS HIT AS WELL?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AND WE'RE SEEING SCHOOL BUSES 
DRIVE BY THIS AREA RIGHT NOW.
SO THIS CLEARLY IS AN AREA THAT 
SCHOOL BUSES TYPICALLY DRIVE 
THROUGH THERE IS JUST A MASSIVE 
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE TRYING TO GET A HANDLE OF 
WHERE EXACTLY THIS HAPPENED 
WHERE WE ARE AT THIS POINT, 
GEORGE.
BUT UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNTS OF 
POLICE ARE HERE.
THEY ARE HERE.
THEY'RE ALL OVER THIS AREA, 
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT 
EVERYONE STAYS SAFE.
BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, SO 
MANY PEOPLE HAVE CROWDED IN 
HERE. 
>> AND WE SEE THOSE LIMOS COMING
INTO THE AREA RIGHT NOW THAT 
COULD BE THE MAYOR OR THE 
GOVERNOR WHO ARE ON THEIR WAY.
AND GIO, WE'VE GOTTEN ONE REPORT
THAT STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL IS 
ON LOCKDOWN.
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING MORE ON 
THAT?
>> I DON'T JUST YET, GEORGE. 
>> TO SUMMARIZE RIGHT NOW, SIX 
PEOPLE KILLED, 11 INJURED IN A 
VIOLENT INCIDENT IN DOWNTOWN 
MANHATTAN THAT WHITE PICKUP 
TRUCK THERE MOWING PEOPLE DOWN 
ON A BIKE PATH.
15 INJURED WE'RE NOW TOLD IN 
ADDITION TO THE 6 DEAD.
OFFICIALS ARE ON THE SCENE.
THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING ALONG 
WITH THE NEW YORK POLICE 
DEPARTMENT.
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRACK
THIS.
WE'LL BE BACK AS THE SITUATION 
DEVELOPS.
>> THIS HAS BEEN A SPECIAL 
REPORT FROM ABC NEWS.REPORT.
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS.
>> AND WE ARE COMING BACK ON THE
AIR NOW WITH MORE ON THAT 
VIOLENT INCIDENT IN DOWNTOWN 
MANHATTAN, UNFOLDED AROUND 3:00 
P.M. EASTERN TIME TODAY WHEN 
THAT MAN RIGHT THERE DRIVING A 
WHITE PICKUP TRUCK MOWED DOWN 
PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS ON A 
PATH, MAKING A PURPOSEFUL TURN 
ON TO THIS PATH THAT LEFT THE 
WHITE PICKUP TRUCK ENGAGED.
YOU SEE HIM RUNNING THERE.
ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, HE WAS 
WAVING AROUND AN IMITATION 
WEAPON.
HE IS NOW IN CUSTODY.
HE WAS DRIVING A WHITE PICKUP 
TRUCK WHICH WAS RENTED FROM HOME
DEPOT.
AND THERE YOU SEE HIM COMING OUT
OF THE TRUCK, BEING CHASED DOWN 
BY POLICE.
TURNED OUT HE DID NOT HAVE A 
GUN.
IT WAS AN IMITATION GUN.
BUT THIS IS NOW BEING TREATED AS
AN ACT OF TERRORISM.
I'M HERE WITH OUR CHIEF 
INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT, 
BRIAN ROSS.
7 DEAD, 15 INJURED RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS A PATTERN WE HAVE SEEN 
BEFORE. 
>> ABSOLUTELY.
FBI ON THE SCENE.
CONSIDER THIS AN INTENTIONAL 
ACT.
HE DROVE AT LEAST TEN BLOCKS 
DOWN THIS BIKE PATH, CROWDED AT 
THAT TIME OF THE DAY.
AND AS YOU SAID, GEORGE, THIS 
HAS HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN, 
GOING BACK JUST TWO YEARS.
TEN SEPARATE INCIDENTS FROM NICE
TO COPENHAGEN TO BERLIN TO 
CHARLOTTESVILLE.
THIS IS HAS BECOME A WAY 
TERRORISTS CARRY OUT ATTACKS. 
>> PIERRE THOMAS IS ALSO WITH 
US.
AND PIERRE, THE INITIAL REPORTS 
SEEM TO INDICATE THIS MIGHT BE 
AN INCIDENT OF ROAD RAGE THAT IS
NOT THE CASE RIGHT NOW.
FEDERAL OFFICIALS ARE ALL OVER 
IT.
>> INDEED.
THOSE WERE SOME OF THE INITIAL 
REPORTS BUT OBVIOUSLY LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AT THE 
FEDERAL LEVEL HAVE BEEN PRESSING
FOR MORE DETAILS.
I CAN TELL YOU, AGAIN, FROM MY 
SOURCES THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT 
THIS AS A POSSIBLE ACT OF 
TERROR.
THAT'S THE WAY IT'S BEEN PHRASED
TO ME.
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE 
GETTING BRIEFINGS HERE IN 
WASHINGTON.
I'M BEING TOLD THAT THE FBI 
DIRECTOR HAS BEEN BRIEFED AND 
HAS ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH 
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF 
SESSIONS.
SO THIS IS GETTING THE HIGHEST 
LEVEL ATTENTION -- ATTENTION 
FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF 
GOVERNMENT. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
BRIEFED AS WELL.
TO LINZIE JANIS ON THE SCENE.
THAT ENTIRE AREA IS ON LOCKDOWN,
SWARMING WITH POLICE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.
AND JUST MOMENTS AGO, WE SAW THE
FBI EVIDENCE RESPONSE TEAM PULL 
UP JUST RIGHT HERE AND HEAD 
TOWARDS THE SCENE.
THE FBI EVIDENCE RESPONSE TEAM, 
A COUPLE OF MEMBERS OF THE 
EVIDENCE RESPONSE TEAM HEADED 
TOWARDS THE SCENE.
POLICE ARE CRAWLING ALL OVER 
THIS AREA.
THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF 
BYSTANDERS JUST STANDING HERE ON
THE STREET CORNER, LOOKS OF 
DISBELIEF ON THEIR FACE.
PEOPLE WERE OUT WITH THEIR 
CHILDREN, TRICK OR TREATING.
SCHOOL WAS JUST LETTING OUT 
ACROSS MANHATTAN AS THIS 
INCIDENT UNFOLDED.
AND WE RECEIVED A VIDEO FROM ONE
OF THESE BYSTANDERS.
A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD BEEN WALKING
ACROSS THE PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY 
ACROSS THE TOP OF THE HIGHWAY.
HE HAD A CLEAR VIEW OF THIS 
INCIDENT UNFOLDING.
HE WAS A STUDENT JUST NORTH OF 
CHAMBERS STREET WHERE I AM HERE.
AND HE SHOWED US THAT VIDEO OF 
THE PERPETRATOR SORT OF STANDING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET, NOT
SURE WHICH WAY TO GO, HOLDING 
THAT OBJECT THAT LOOKED LIKE A 
GUN.
WE NOW HEAR SOME SORT OF FAKE 
GUN. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT, LINZIE.
WE HAVE THAT STUDENT ON THE 
PHONE RIGHT NOW, THIBAULT ROY, 
15-YEAR-OLD SHOT THE VIDEO.
WE'RE WATCHING THAT VIDEO RIGHT 
NOW.
WE SEE THE GUNMAN RUNNING 
THROUGH THE STREET, SURROUNDED 
BY TAXIS.
TELL WHAT'S YOU WERE SEEING, 
WHAT YOU WERE THINKING AT THE 
TIME.
>> I WAS ACTUALLY WALKING.
AND I -- 
>> I THINK WE LOST THIBAULT 
RIGHT THERE.
WE HAVE TO GET A BETTER PHONE 
CONNECTION AND COME BACK TO HIM.
BUT GIO BENITEZ ON THE SCENE.
>> GEORGE, HEY THERE.
SO RIGHT HERE, WHAT WE'RE SEEING
IS THAT THIS ROAD HAS BEEN 
COMPLETELY BLOCKED OFF.
AND WE KNOW THAT THIS HAPPENED 
ABOUT TWO BLOCKS FROM HERE.
BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS MORE 
POLICE, MORE POLICE, JUST 
COMING.
WE'VE SEEN AMBULANCES COME 
THROUGH HERE.
AND WE'RE JUST SEEING A MASSIVE 
POLICE PRESENCE.
CLEARLY, THEY'RE TRYING TO GET A
HANDLE OF IT TOO.
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS WE'RE 
SEEING MAJOR TRAFFIC ON THIS 
STREET.
BUT RIGHT NOW, GEORGE, WE HAVE 
THIS MAJOR, MAJOR ROAD HERE IN 
DOWNTOWN NEW YORK, DOWNTOWN 
MANHATTAN, COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN 
AT THIS POINT.
>> COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.
STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL HAD BEEN 
ON LOCKDOWN.
AND GIO, THERE HAD ALSO BEEN A 
REPORT THAT SOME OF THE INJURED,
YOUNG STUDENTS, SPECIAL NEEDS 
STUDENTS IN A SCHOOL BUS WHO 
WERE HIT BY THAT PICKUP TRUCK.
>> AND WE HAVE BEEN SEEING SO 
MANY SCHOOL BUSES, GEORGE, COME 
THROUGH HERE.
SO CLEARLY THIS IS A STREET THAT
MANY SCHOOL BUSES TYPICALLY GO 
THROUGH.
IT'S THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY.
AND FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW NEW
YORK CITY, THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY
IS JUST ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
THOROUGHFARES IN NEW YORK WHERE 
SO MANY CARS JUST GO ALL ALONG 
LITERALLY THE WEST SIDE OF NEW 
YORK CITY.
AND THAT IS WHERE YOU WOULD FIND
SCHOOL BUSES, YOU WOULD FIND 
PEOPLE LEAVING FROM WORK.
YOU WOULD FIND SO MANY BIKERS 
THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A 
MASSIVE BIKE LANE THERE TO USE.
AND SO THAT IS WHAT IS USED 
RIGHT NOW IN NEW YORK CITY.
AND THAT'S WHAT IS SHUT DOWN AT 
THIS POINT.
I'M TRYING TO SEE IF WE CAN SEE 
BEYOND IT.
BUT JUST SO MANY POLICE THERE.
>> OKAY.
TRY AND FIND OUT SOME MORE.
WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK 
THIBAULT ROY, THE STUDENT WHO 
SHOT THE VIDEO.
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
THIBAULT, ARE YOU THERE?
>> HELLO?
>> HI, THIBAULT.
IT'S GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS.
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
TELL US ABOUT THAT VIDEO YOU 
WERE SHOOTING.
I THINK WE HAVE A BETTER 
CONNECTION NOW. 
>> AS I SAID BEFORE, THIS ISN'T 
MY VIDEO.
I GOT IT FROM A FRIEND.
BUT I SAW THE SHOOTER COME 
OUTSIDE OF HIS CAR.
AND I SAW HIM EXIT AND RUN 
TOWARDS A GROUP OF KIDS.
AND THEN I WENT BACK INTO MY 
SCHOOL.
>> THE POLICE HAVE SAID HE WAS 
WAVING SOME SORT OF AN IMITATION
GUN.
DID YOU SEE THAT?
WE SEE IT NOW IN THE VIDEO.
>> THEY LOOKED REAL TO ME.
BUT HE WAS WAVING THEM AROUND.
I DID SEE THAT.
AND HE SPRINTED TOWARDS A GROUP 
OF KIDS.
>> TOWARDS THE GROUP OF KIDS?
>> THAT'S WHAT I SAW, YEAH.
>> AND ABOUT HOW LONG DID THIS 
TAKE PLACE?
HOW LONG WERE YOU WATCHING HIM 
FOR?
>> I WAS WATCHING HIM FOR ABOUT 
MAYBE 20 SECONDS BEFORE I -- I 
HAD TO JUST RUN BACK JUST FOR MY
OWN SAFETY. 
>> RIGHT.
AND YOU SAY THEY LOOKED REAL.
BUT COULD YOU TELL?
COULD YOU HEAR IF ANY KIND OF 
ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION WERE COMING
OUT OF HIS GUN, OR YOU COULDN'T 
TELL?
>> I DID NOT HEAR ANY SHOTS AND 
I DIDN'T SEE HIM FIRE AT 
ANYBODY.
>> WAS HE SAYING ANYTHING?
>> HE DID NOT.
THAT I COULD HEAR.
>> WHEN YOU WENT BACK INSIDE 
BEFORE HE WAS APPREHENDED BY THE
POLICE?
>> YES, I WAS.
>> WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 
WHO SHOT THE VIDEO AND WHERE YOU
WERE ABLE TO GET IT?
>> I GOT IT FROM A FRIEND WHO 
WAS WALKING ON THE BRIDGE 
FARTHER DOWN FROM WHERE I WAS.
AND FROM WHAT I CAN TELL, THEY 
JUST SPRINTED FROM THAT TOWARD 
THE END OF THE BRIDGE AND JUST 
LEFT THE VICINITY.
>> THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A 
TERRIFYING 20 SECONDS.
>> IT WAS PRETTY SCARY, YEAH.
BUT WE'RE ALL SAFE NOW.
>> WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE OKAY NOW.
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT STORY
AND THIS VIDEO WITH US.
BRIAN ROSS HERE AS WELL.
NEW YORK IS ALWAYS ON HIGH ALERT
IN NEW YORK CITY. 
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> WE HAVEN'T HAD AN INCIDENT 
QUITE LIKE THIS. 
>> THEY'VE TAKEN STEPS TO BLOCK 
OFF ACCESS TO PEDESTRIAN 
WALKWAYS IN TIMES SQUARE AND 
MAJOR CENTERS, BUT NOT THIS BIKE
PATH.
THEY'RE ALWAYS ON GUARD, 
OBVIOUSLY.
IN THIS CASE, THOUGH, GEORGE, 
WITH A SUSPECT IN CUSTODY, HE 
WAS SHOT, BUT IS DESCRIBED AS 
ALIVE.
WITH A SUSPECT IN CUSTODY, 
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO QUICKLY 
DETERMINE WHO HE IS AND WHAT HIS
BACKGROUND IS, WHAT KIND OF 
ELECTRONIC SOCIAL MEDIA HE MAY 
HAVE. 
>> WHETHER HE WAS ACTING ALONE?
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
>> LET'S GO TO JON KARL AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
>> HE HAS BEEN BRIEFED BY JOHN 
KELLY AND WE'RE TOLD HE'LL BE 
KEPT UP TO DATE AS FURTHER 
DEVELOPMENTS COME OUT.
ALSO, THE FIRST LADY HAS TWEETED
HER RESPONSE TO THIS SAYING "MY 
HEARTBREAKS FOR NEW YORK CITY 
TODAY.
HEARTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THE 
VICTIMS."
OF COURSE, GEORGE, THIS IS AN 
ATTACK THAT IS IN THE 
PRESIDENT'S HOMETOWN, SOMETHING 
THAT HITS PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO 
HOME FOR THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 
FAMILY. 
>> VERY CLOSE TO HOME.
AND A VERY HARD HIT.
AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING, 7 DEAD, 15
INJURED AFTER AN INCIDENT THAT 
UNFOLDED AT APPROXIMATELY 3:00 
P.M. HERE IN NEW YORK CITY LOWER
MANHATTAN AT 3:00 P.M. WHEN A 
MAN DRIVING A RENTED WHITE 
PICKUP TRUCK FROM HOME DEPOT 
TURNED ON TO THAT BIKE PATH YOU 
SEE RIGHT THERE WITH THAT TRUCK 
AND STARTED TO MOW DOWN 
PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS.
ALSO HITTING A SCHOOL BUS 
CARRYING SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN.
THIS IS NOW BEING TREATED AS AN 
ACT OF TERRORISM.
LINZIE JANIS IS ON THE SCENE.
EVERYONE DOWN THERE NOW, LINZIE 
PREPARING FOR A BRIEFING FROM 
THE GOVERNOR AND THE MAYOR IN 
THE NEXT HALF HOUR OR SO?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE BEING TOLD WE WILL HEAR 
FROM THEM AT ABOUT 5:15 EASTERN.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING MORE 
POLICE VEHICLES COMING THROUGH 
TOWARDS THE SCENE OF THE CRIME 
HERE.
WE DID SEE THE FBI EVIDENCE 
RESPONSE TEAM HEADED THAT WAY 
JUST A FEW MOMENTS OKAY.
WE KNOW THIS IS NOW BEING 
TREATED AS AN ACT OF TERROR.
BUT JUST TO TELL YOU A LITTLE 
BIT MORE ABOUT THAT BIKE PATH 
THAT RUNS ALONG THE WEST SIDE 
HIGHWAY.
AFTER THREE3:00 THIS AFTERNOON, 
WOULD HAVE BEEN PACKED.
JOGGER, BIKERS, PEOPLE WALKING.
THIS IS AROUND THE TIME JUST 
AFTER 3:00 P.M. THAT SCHOOLS 
START GETTING OUT.
IT'S HALLOWEEN.
PARENTS GETTING OFF WORK EARLY 
TO GATHER THEIR KIDS AND TO TAKE
THEM TRICK OR TREATING.
I'M STANDING ON A CORNER HERE OF
A MAJOR STREET, CHAMBERS HERE IN
DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN AND TRIBECA.
THERE ARE PEOPLE ALL OVER JUST 
STANDING HERE WITH LOOKS OF 
DISBELIEF ON THEIR FACES.
THIS HAS HAPPENED HERE IN 
MANHATTAN NOW.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING IT WAS 
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.
IT APPEARS THAT A TERROR HAS 
STRUCK HERE ONCE AGAIN IN THE 
HEART OF MANHATTAN.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, LINZIE.
AND LINZIE, THAT NEIGHBORHOOD 
NOT ALL THAT FAR FROM GROUND 
ZERO, THE SITE OF THE 9/11 
ATTACKS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO THE 9/11 
SPOT, TO THE MEMORIAL MUSEUM 
THERE.
AND NEIGHBORHOOD VERY, VERY, 
VERY BUSY.
DOWNTOWN IS KIND OF WHERE IT'S 
AT ON HALLOWEEN.
THE VILLAGE NOT TOO FAR FROM 
HERE IS WHERE THE BIG PARADE IS.
CERTAINLY THE AREA WHERE THIS 
PERSON STRUCK WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
VERY, VERY BUSY AREA.
THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY, THAT BIKE
PATH, THAT BIKE PATH THERE.
AND AS YOU MENTIONED, SCHOOLS 
LETTING OUT AS WELL.
>> OKAY, LINZIE JANIS, THANKS 
VERY MUCH.
I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY THE 
FORMER CHIEF OF POLICE OF NEW 
YORK CITY, RAY KELLY.
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING YOU 
PREPARED FOR YEAR AFTER YEAR 
AFTER YEAR, AND NOW IT'S 
HAPPENED.
>> RIGHT.
OBVIOUSLY IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY
EASIER THERE ARE A LOT OF POLICE
IN THAT GENERAL AREA, BUT NOT 
SPECIFICALLY WHERE THIS 
INDIVIDUAL WENT ON TO THE BIKE 
PATH.
AND HE HAD AT LEAST A FOUR-BLOCK
RUN.
AND AT 3:00 IN THE AFTERNOON, 
THAT BIKE PATH, WHICH IS VERY 
WIDE BIKE PATH IS VERY BUSY WITH
JOGGERS AND BIKERS.
SO CLEARLY INTENTIONAL.
AN EFFORT TO KILL PEOPLE.
WE KNOW THAT THE SEVEN DEAD SO 
FAR.
THIS INDIVIDUAL MADE STATEMENTS.
HE MADE A STATEMENT ALLAHU 
AKBAR.
>> DO WE KNOW HE SAID THAT?
>> IT'S REPORTED BY WITNESSES. 
>> THIS IS WHAT POLICE ARE 
FINDING OUT RIGHT NOW. 
>> THIS IS WHAT POLICE ARE 
FINDING OUT.
THIS IS A STATEMENT.
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A LOT OF 
POTENTIAL WITNESSES.
SO THE GATHERING PEOPLE, 
QUESTIONING.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME.
BUT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TOLD.
I'M NOT CERTAIN IF IN FACT HE 
HAD A WEAPON OR REPORTED THAT 
HAD A WEAPON THAT DIDN'T WORK.
BUT THE ONLY SHOT THAT WERE 
FIRED APPEARED TO BE FROM THE 
POLICE TO STOP IT. 
>> AND THEY DID INJURE THE 
DRIVER?
>> HE WAS STRUCK IN THE 
BUTTOCKS, AND HE IS IN CUSTODY 
NOW.
HE SAY LIVE. 
>> WOULD THEY ALREADY BE TALKING
TO HIM?
>> NO.
IT PROBABLY WOULD BE WAY TOO 
EARLY TO TALK TO HIM, UNLESS 
THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE THREAT.
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY DOING A LOT OF
BACKGROUND EXAMINATION OF HIM.
WE'RE THEOLD THAT HE MAY BE OF 
BOSNIAN ORIGIN.
THEY'RE CHECKING -- CERTAINLY 
THE FBI IS TALKING TO PEOPLE AND
INTERPOL, ORGANIZATIONS LIKE 
THAT.
FIND OUT ANY BIT OF INFORMATION 
THAT CAN GIVE THEM A BETTER FEEL
IN THIS INVESTIGATION. 
>> AND OBVIOUSLY TRY TO FIGURE 
FOUGHT THERE IS ANY KIND OF 
COORDINATION WITH ANYONE ELSE, 
ANY POSSIBILITY OF A FOLLOW-ON 
ATTACK. 
>> EXACTLY WHERE.
DID HE LIVE, AND HIS PHONE IS 
ALWAYS SIGNIFICANT.
ANY CRIMINAL RECORD, ALL OF 
THESE THINGS.
I'M SURE HAVE BEEN CHECKED 
ALREADY OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF
DOING A DEEP DIVE ON THIS 
INDIVIDUAL.
>> JOINED ON THE PHONE NOW BY 
COUNTER TERROR EXPERT RICHARD 
CLARKE.
OF COURSE WORKED IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE FOR MANY YEARS.
RICHARD, THIS IS BECOMING SUCH A
PATTERN WE'RE SEE RIGHT NOW.
NO SIGNS YET THAT HE WAS WORKING
WITH ANYONE ELSE.
BUT STILL VERY DEADLY.
>> GEORGE, THE TEST 
>> TOWARDS THE PATTERN WE'RE 
SEEING
SEEING, BOTH THE UNITED STATES 
AND EUROPE AND INDIVIDUALS GO 
OUT AND GET A TRUCK.
THE POLICE IN THE UNITED STATES 
AND EUROPE KNOW THIS IS A 
POSSIBILITY.
THEY'VE BEEN GOING AROUND TO 
SPECIAL EVENTS AND BLOCKING 
TRAILER TRUCKS AND DUMP TRUCKS.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT EVERYWHERE.
THIS TECHNIQUE IS WELL-KNOWN NOW
AROUND THE WORLD.
POTENTIAL TERRORISTS KNOW IT 
WORKS.
>> WE'VE SEEN IT IN NICE, 
BARCELONA AND LONDON AND 
GERMANY.
>> IT'S NO ACCIDENT THE REACTION
COMES AS WE SEE THE MAN RIGHT 
THERE DRIVING THE PICKUP TRUCK, 
AS ISIS IS TAKING MORE DEFEATS 
ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN IRAQ AND 
SYRIA.
>> WE HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING AND
BEEN SAYING, WITH ISIS LOSING 
CONTROL OF THE MAJOR CITIES, 
THEY STILL HAVE THOUSANDS, TENS 
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
THEY WILL CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE.
ISIS IS NOT DEAD.
THE FACT IT CAN CREATE PEOPLE 
SPONTANEOUSLY BECOMING MEMBERS 
OF ISIS AND WITHIN HOURS OF THAT
DECISION, GOING OUT AND KILLING 
PEOPLE HERE IN OUR COUNTRY AND 
ALL OVER EUROPE, ISIS WILL BE A 
FORCE FOR A WHILE. 
>> DESCRIBE HOW THOSE MESSAGES 
GET OUT.
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF ISIS AND 
AL QAEDA RELATED WEBSITES, VERY 
PERSUASIVE TO A CERTAIN KIND OF 
INDIVIDUAL.
THEY'RE IN MANY DIFFERENT 
LANGUAGES, NOT JUST ARABIC.
>> THANKS, RICK.
I WANT TO BRING IN ANOTHER 
EYEWITNESS, DIMITRI.
TELL US WHAT YOU SAW.
DIMITRI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
IT'S GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS HERE.
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW.
>> I WAS ON THE WESTSIDE HIGHWAY
READING MY E-MAIL WHEN MY UBER 
DRIVER SAID, LOOK, THE CAR IS 
BASICALLY MOWING PEOPLE DOWN.
WHEN I LOOKED UP, I DIDN'T SEE 
THE CAR, IT HAD ALREADY PAST.
I SAW THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE LYING
IN A PILE OF BLOOD.
FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS A 
HALLOWEEN PERFORMANCE.
I WAS LOOKING AND COULDN'T TELL 
WHAT WAS GOING ON.
I SAW THE POLICE HEADING TOWARDS
THE FIRE AND SHOTS FIRED.
SHOTS WERE DEFINITELY FIRED 
AFTER THOSE PEOPLE WERE MOWED 
DOWN.
>> THIS HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY.
>> POLICE CAME IN TWO OR THREE 
MINUTES, TWO MINUTES OUT THERE, 
WHILE I WAS THINKING, IS IT SORT
OF LIKE -- TWO MINUTES TOPS.
THE SHOTS WERE FIRED AND THEY 
HUNKERED DOWN.
THEN THEY STARTED WAVING TO US.
THEN, WHEN WE CAME THERE, I SAW 
THE CAR, RENTAL TRUCK, SOME SORT
OF LIKE THAT, ENTERPRISE, LIKE A
TRUCK.
DOING THINGS.
IT WAS A VERY VERY LARGE TRUCK.
THEN, I SAW THE SPEED BUMP ALSO 
LIKE A SMALL SPEED BUMP BADLY 
DAMAGED.
THEN, AS THEY WERE WAVING US TO 
QUO PAST, I SAW THE GENTLEMAN 
LYING DOWN, IN A PILE OF BLOOD.
POLICE WERE LOOKING AT HIM AND 
THERE WAS ANOTHER VERY FAT 
GENTLEMAN ON HIS KNEES WITH HIS 
HANDS IN THE AIR, STANDING ON 
THE SIDE.
>> I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT
ONE THING.
YOU'RE SAYING YOU SAW A MAN ON 
HIS KNEES WITH HIS HANDS UP IN 
THE AIR SURROUNDED BY THE POLICE
AND ANOTHER MAN?
YOU DON'T KNOW?
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT?
>> WHETHER THAT MAN WAS PART OF 
IT OR NOT, RIGHT?
HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE.
HE WAS WAY PAST THIS THREE 
TRUCKS.
HE TRIED TO RAM, ONE OF THE 
TRUCKS.
I'M NOT GOING TO SPECULATE.
I CAN ONLY SAY WHAT I HAVE SEEN 
PERSONALLY.
>> WHAT WAS HE WEARING?
>> THE GENTLEMAN THAT WAS -- 
APPEARED TO BE VERY FAT AND IT 
SEEMED LIKE THE ONE WOUNDED HAD 
LIKE A BLACK BEARD.
>> OKAY.
THAT'S THE PERSON WE SEE RUNNING
AROUND BEFORE HE WAS BROUGHT 
DOWN BY POLICE IN SOMETHING LIKE
A DARK TRACK SUIT WITH A RED 
STRIPE ACROSS THE BACK, IS THAT 
WHAT YOU REMEMBER?
>> THAT, I DIDN'T SEE BECAUSE HE
WAS ALREADY ON THE GROUND.
AT THE TIME.
>> YOU MENTIONED A SMALL SCHOOL 
BUS HAD BEEN HIT.
WE WERE TOLD THERE WERE SPECIAL 
NEEDS CHILDREN.
COULD YOU SEE ANY PEOPLE INSIDE,
ANY INJURIES INSIDE?
>> NO.
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL BUS WAS 
PROBABLY 200, 100 METERS.
I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE 
STREET THE PARTICULAR WEST SIDE 
HIGHWAY.
ALL I SEE WAS IT WAS BADLY 
DAMAGED, FROM THE LOOKS OF IT.
THEY WERE WAVING US BY.
NOW, I SORT OF FEEL LIKE -- TRY 
TO HELP SOMEBODY.
THEY WERE WAVING THE CAR TO GO 
BY.
AND SEE HIM SHOOTING, CRAZY.
>> YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF FOR 
THAT.
CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT HOW 
MANY YOU SAW AND INJURIES YOU 
SAW?
>> THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR 
PEOPLE LYING BY THE WESTSIDE 
HIGHWAY.
THERE WERE KIDS FROM THE HIGH 
SCHOOL THAT WERE MOWED DOWN, IN 
SOME SORT OF PERFORMANCE, SOME 
SORT OF SHOW FOR THE HALL BEEN, 
AT FIRST, BEFORE I REALIZED WHAT
IS GOING ON.
>> ALAS, IT HAS TURNED OUT NOT 
TO BE THE CASE.
GLAD YOU'RE OKAY FOR TURNING IN 
THOSE DETAILS.
I'M WITH OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT
AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE 
PERPETUATE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
OUR COLLEAGUE BELIEVES THEY HAVE
THE SUSPECT IDENTIFIED, 30 YEARS
OLD OF MIDDLE EASTERN DISSENT, 
CARRYING AN ID FROM FLORIDA AND 
WE'RE LOOKING INTO HIS 
BACKGROUND WE'RE BEING TOLD IT 
WAS A DELIBERATE ACT OF 
TERRORISM.
>> AND KELLY, THE CHIEF OF 
POLICE, WILL BE ABLE TO 
COORDINATE QUITE QUICKLY WITH 
AUTHORITIES.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
YOU WANT TO GET INTO HIS HOME 
WHERE HE LIVES, INTO HIS CELL 
PHONE.
THEY WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY 
WITH THE FLORIDA AUTHORITIES AND
FBI WILL, OF COURSE, RESPOND TO 
HIS RESIDENCE.
YOU WANT TO GET ANY BIT OF 
INFORMATION, GRANULAR 
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS 
INDIVIDUAL AND MAKE SURE THERE 
IS NO ONE ELSE INVOLVED.
TONIGHT, WE HAVE A HALLOWEEN 
PARADE IN NEW YORK CITY.
>> EXPLAIN THAT.
AFTER AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS, HOW
DOES THIS CITY LIKE NEW YORK 
PREPARE FOR HALLOWEEN, WHAT KIND
OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES DO THEY 
PUT ON THE STREET?
WILL THEY TELL PEOPLE NOT TO GO 
OUT?
>> NO, I DON'T THINK THAT WILL 
BE THE CASE.
YOU WILL DEFINITELY SEE MORE 
POLICE AT THE PARADE AND 
BLOCKING VEHICLES AND THE NYPD 
HAS BLOCKED TO BLOCK OFF 
STREETS.
I THINK IT WILL BE VERY SAFE AND
CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF POLICE 
OFFICERS.
THIS IS THE BIGGEST DEPARTMENT 
IN THE COUNTRY, 54,000 
EMPLOYEES, ABLE TO DO MULTIPLE 
THINGS AT THE SAME TIME.
>> LET'S BRING IN THE SENIOR 
JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT, PIERRE 
THOMAS.
NO INDICATION ANYONE ELSE IS 
INVOLVED, PIERRE.
THESE KIND OF LONE WOLF ATTACKS,
IF THAT IS INDEED WHAT IT TURNS 
OUT TO BE IN THE END, 
PROLIFERATING ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY, THE HIGHEST STATE OF 
ALERT IN SO MANY CITIES.
>> GEORGE, I CAN TELL YOU THE 
LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, THIS HAS 
BEEN THE HIGHEST PRIORITY, MOST 
IMMINENT THREATS CONCERNING 
AUTHORITIES.
BULLETIN AFTER BULLETIN HAVE 
BEEN SENT OUT BY THE FBI AND 
HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICIALS TO 
POLICE AROUND THIS COUNTRY 
REMINDING PEOPLE TERRORISTS AND 
PEOPLE ARE INSPIRED BY WHAT 
THEY'RE SEEING PRIMARILY 
OVERSEAS IN EUROPE TO CONDUCT 
WHAT THEY CALL LOW SCALE 
UNSOPHISTICATED ATTACKS WHERE 
YOU SIMPLY NEED THE WILL AND A 
VEHICLE TO RUN OVER PEOPLE.
THIS IS AN ONGOING CONCERN AND 
WILL ONLY HEIGHTEN AFTER THIS 
INCIDENT.
THEY'RE INVESTIGATING THIS, 
BELIEVING IT'S POSSIBLY AN ACT 
OF TERRORISM.
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SUSPECT 
INCLUDING LOOKING AT HIS MENTAL 
HEALTH, I'M TOLD.
THIS IS THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO 
POLICE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED 
ABOUT, GEORGE, BECAUSE THERE'S 
SO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES YOU CAN
SEE PEOPLE WALKING AND THEN RUN 
OVER THEM.
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.
>> NONE OF THE PEOPLE ON THAT 
BIKE PATH WHEN THE TRUCK MADE 
THAT TURN -- ANDREW JOINS US 
NOW.
ANDREW, WHAT DID YOU SEE?
>> HI THERE, GEORGE.
I WAS WALKING ALONG THAT BIKE 
PATH, ALONG THE HUDSON RIVER, TO
THE SOUTH, TOWARDS CHAMBERS 
STREET.
LUCKILY FOR ME, I WAS OVER ON 
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PATH.
I HEARD A VERY LOUD NOISE, 
UNEXPECTED NOISE TO HEAR ON THAT
BIKE PATH OF A TRUCK DRIVING BY 
ME, AT A VERY HIGH SPEED.
VERY VERY RARE TO SEE ANY 
VEHICLE ON THERE, CERTAINLY 
DON'T SEE TRUCKS AND CERTAINLY 
DON'T SEE TRUCKS DRIVING SO 
FAST.
POWERING BY VERY FAST.
I SAW THE TRUCK IMPACT, FOR 
SURE, ONE CYCLIST, WHO WAS 
RIDING NORTH, HIT THE 
WINDSHIELD, WENT UP TO THE AIR 
AND LANDED MOTIONLESS.
>> THE TRUCK WENT STRAIGHT FOR 
HIM?
>> YEAH.
THE TRUCK WASN'T EVEN DEVIATING 
ON THE PATH, WAS JUST GOING 
STRAIGHT DOWN, SO IT DOESN'T 
LOOK LIKE WAS TRYING TO HIT THE 
CYCLIST BUT SIMPLY GOING AT A 
VERY HIGH SPEED, RIGHT DOWN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE PATH, TAKING OUT 
ANYTHING IN ITS PATH.
>> COULD YOU SEE HOW FAR HE 
DROVE?
>> SO, YEAH, THEN I SAW THE 
TRUCK CONTINUING.
THAT WAS ABOUT A BLOCK FARTHER 
ON, WHEN IT COLLIDED WITH 
SOMETHING ON CHAMBERS STREET, I 
DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A UTILITY 
POLE OR WHAT, THE TRUCK SPUN, 
THEN WAS FACING EAST.
I SAW THE DRIVER GET OUT OF THE 
CAR AND THEN FLEE.
IT LOOKED TO ME HE WAS THEN 
FLEEING SOUTHWARD, AWAY FROM ME.
ABOUT A MINUTE LATER I HEARD A 
FEW GUNSHOTS.
AT THAT POINT, SOME OF THE 
OTHERS WHO HAD BEEN WITNESS TO 
THIS, STARTED TO RUN THEMSELVES,
TO RUN NORTH, AWAY FROM THE 
SOUND OF THE GUNFIRE.
>> WHEN YOU SAW HIM FLEE, COULD 
YOU HEAR HIM SAY ANYTHING?
SEE IF HE WAS CARRYING ANYTHING?
>> NO.
IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO REALLY 
SEE MUCH ABOUT HIM, WHAT HE WAS 
DOING, ALSO VERY DISTRACTING 
BECAUSE THERE WAS PROBABLY A 
DEAD CYCLIST RIGHT THERE, WHICH 
WAS THE CONCERN FOR THOSE OF US 
WHO WERE KLOSE BY.
>> WHEN YOU'RE WALKING DOWN A 
PATH LIKE THAT, THIS IS NOT 
SOMETHING YOU CAN IMAGINE 
HAPPENING.
>> EXACTLY.
THIS IS SOMETHING.
I RIDE ON THAT PATH ALL THE 
TIME.
THIS IS A KEY RECREATIONAL PART 
OF NEW YORK CITY.
TO HAVE THAT EVENT HAPPEN IN 
SHADOW, THAT SENSE OF PEACE AND 
RECREATION, WHICH IS WHAT THAT 
PATH IS ALL ABOUT, IS DEEPLY 
DISTURBING.
>> WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE OKAY, 
ANDREW.
THIS IS QUITE A SERIOUS 
INCIDENT.
THANK YOU FOR FILLING US IN ON 
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
WE LEARNED A LITTLE BIT MORE, 
RIGHT THERE, TRAVELING AT A VERY
HIGH SPEED ON THAT PATH, ALMOST 
NO WAY TO PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE
THAT.
>> NO.
A TRUCK THAT SIZE WOULD PRETTY 
MUCH FILL UP THE PATH.
I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT.
IT'S A WIDE PATH.
A TRUCK, A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT 
TRUCK, COULDN'T DEVIATE LEFT TO 
RIGHT.
HE OBVIOUSLY WANTED TO KILL AS 
MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AT A 
HIGH SPEED AND HE WOULD HAVE 
CONTINUED UNLESS HE DIDN'T HIT 
WHATEVER HE STRUCK ON CHAMBERS 
STREET.
>> THE RENTAL TRUCK FROM HOME 
DEPOT ARE COOPERATING RIGHT NOW.
>> EXACTLY.
THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE CALLING ON 
OTHERS TO DO, GET A TRUCK, AS 
PIERRE HAS SAID, WHAT YOU HAVE 
SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN, WHATEVER 
THEY CAN GET TO TAKE OFF.
IN THE LONG LIST OF CITIES HIT 
LIKE THIS, STARTING, I JUST MADE
A LIST HERE.
NICE AND OHIO STATE, BERLIN, 
JERUSALEM, AND LONDON, THREE 
DIFFERENT, STOCKHOLM, 
CHARLOTTESVILLE AND BARCELONA 
AND NOW NEW YORK.
>> NOW, NEW YORK CITY AS WELL.
AND NEW YORK CITY IN FIVE DAYS, 
NEW YORK CITY MARATHON, TENS OF 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, ALL IN THE 
FIVE BOROUGHS.
>> THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE 
DEPARTMENT IS STRUCTURED TO 
PROTECT THE MARATHON.
26 MILES OF INTENSE CROWDS, NO 
QUESTION ABOUT IT.
WHEN THEY GET INTO MANHATTAN, 
PROBABLY A MILLION PEOPLE 
WATCHING THE ROUTE.
THERE'LL BE A LOT OF BLOCKING 
CARS INVOLVED WITH THE MARATHON 
AS THEY ALWAYS DO.
THEY WILL INCREASE THAT.
>> WHAT KIND OF CHANGES WERE PUT
IN PLACE FOR THE MARATHON AFTER 
THE ATTACKS OF THE BOSTON 
MARATHON?
>> WE PUT IN CAMERAS.
WE HAD A LOT MORE PORTABLE 
CAMERAS THAT WE PUT IN, ALL 
ALONG THE ROUTE.
WE WANTED TO INCREASE AS MUCH 
CAMERA EXPOSURE AS POSSIBLE, 
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF POLICE 
OFFICERS ASSIGNED.
OVERALL, INCREASE THE SECURITY 
WHERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT 
CROWDS.
GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE CROWDS 
ARE PRETTY THICK.
SOME THICKER THAN OTHERS.
>> THAT'S WHY GENERALLY 
DAY-TO-DAY YOU HAVE A 
SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IN TIME 
SQUARE.
NOT NECESSARILY AN AVERAGE 
NEIGHBORHOOD IN DOWNTOWN NEW 
YORK.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY 
RIGHT.
HE WAS SAYING IT WAS ONLY A FEW 
BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE WORLD TRADE
CENTER SITE.
A LOT OF POLICE THERE BUT NOT 
ALONG THE BIKE PATH.
YOU CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE AND YOU 
USE CAMERAS AS A FORCE 
MULTIPLIER, I DON'T KNOW HOW 
MANY WERE ALONG THE BIKE PATH.
>> I WILL GO TO GIO BENITIZ ON 
THE SCENE, WE'RE WAITING FOR THE
MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, BILL DE 
BLASIO AND THE MAYOR.
WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE NOW?
>> Reporter: I WANT YOU TO SEE 
HOW BUSY THIS AREA IS.
WE ARE SEEING STUDENT AFTER 
STUDENT IN THIS AREA, BECAUSE 
THIS AREA IS ACTUALLY FILLED 
WITH SCHOOLS.
YOU MENTIONED THE HIGH SCHOOL 
THAT IS RIGHT THERE IN THAT AREA
WHERE THIS HAPPENED, THIS IS 
INDEPENDENT SQUARE HERE.
CLEARLY, A LOT OF STUDENTS ARE 
IN THIS AREA, A LOT OF PEOPLE IN
THIS AREA.
WE ARE JUST UNDER THE WORLD 
TRADE CENTER, WE CAN SEE IT 
HERE.
THAT'S THIS TYPE OF AREA YOU 
HAVE A LOT OF BUSINESS PEOPLE.
THAT HAPPENED AS SCHOOLS WERE 
LETTING OUT AND MADE IT SO 
DANGEROUS, ESPECIALLY THESE 
STUDENTS.
THAT BUSINESS AREA IS ALWAYS 
FILLED WITH BIKERS AND 
PEDESTRIANS, GEORGE.
>> AT 3:00, WHEN THE SCHOOLS 
WERE BEING LET OUT, WE WERE JUST
TOLD PS 89, AND CHILDREN STILL 
DRESSED IN HALLOWEEN COSTUMES 
FINALLY BEING LET OUT.
>> Reporter: WE'RE SEEING 
STUDENT AFTER STUDENT IN THIS 
AREA.
THAT'S WHY I THINK WE WILL HAVE 
A LOT OF WITNESSES THAT SHOT 
THIS VIDEO, ALL IN THIS AREA AND
THE POLICE HAS THE STREET 
BLOCKED OFF IN THIS AREA.
A BLOCK OR TWO BLOCKS.
IF WE PAN THIS CAMERA YOU CAN 
SEE IT TOTALLY BLOCKED OFF AND 
SEE ALL THE POLICE STILL THERE.
>> THANKS.
WE WILL COME BACK.
WE ARE SHOWING THE PODIUM WE 
EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THE MAYOR 
AND GOVERNOR AND RAY KELLY.
PRESUMABLY NOW, THEY HAVE BEEN 
IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH POLICE 
OFFICIALS AND ABLE TO GIVE US 
THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION.
>> YOU WILL GET, I THINK, ALL 
THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE 
GATHERED, OBVIOUSLY, SOME THINGS
YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT OUT NOW, 
BUT MOSTLY, YOU'RE GOING TO GET 
A LOT OF DETAIL.
>> SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE 
DON'T KNOW, NEW YORK CITY POLICE
DEPARTMENT HAS A HUGE 
INTELLIGENCE OPERATION AS WELL.
>> IT HAS OVER 500 PEOPLE IN THE
INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, CERTAINLY
THE BIGGEST POLICE DEPARTMENT IN
THE COUNTRY AND ALSO HAS PEOPLE 
ASSIGNED OVERSEAS, NOW 12 
CITIES.
THEY'RE OVER THERE TO ACT AS 
TRIPWIRES AND GATHER ANY 
INFORMATION THEY CAN.
IT MAY BE RELEVANT HERE 
DEPENDING WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL'S 
BACKGROUND IS.
>> WE SEE THE OFFICIALS AND THE 
POLICE COMMISSIONER, MR. 
O'NEILL.
LOOKS LIKE HE WILL SPEAK FIRST.
>> LOOKS LIKE THE POLICE 
COMMISSIONER WILL SPEAK FIRST. 
>> THE MAYOR ON HIS RIGHT AND 
GOVERNOR ON HIS LEFT.
>> STATE POLICE BEHIND GOVERNOR 
CUOMO.
>> LET'S LISTEN.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY.
WE GOOD?
ALL RIGHT.
KEEP IN MIND, THIS HAPPENED A 
LITTLE MORE THAN TWO HOURS AGO, 
ALL THE INFORMATION WE'RE GIVING
YOU RIGHT NOW IS PRELIMINARY AND
SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
AFTER I SPEAK YOU WILL HEAR FROM
GOVERNOR CUOMO AND MAYOR DE 
BLASIO AND BILL SWEENEY 
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF 
THE FBI OFFICES STANDING WITH ME
AND MEMBERS OF MY EXECUTIVE 
STAFF.
WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE STATE 
POLICE.
FIRST, I WANT TO SAY THAT TODAY 
THERE IS A LOSS OF INNOCENT LIFE
IN LOWER MANHATTAN.
THEY WERE JUST GOING ABOUT THEIR
DAYS, HEADING OFF FROM SCHOOL 
AND ENJOYING THE AFTERNOON SUN 
ON BICYCLES.
THIS IS A TRAGEDY OF THE 
GREATEST MAGNITUDE FOR MANY IN 
NEW YORK CITY AND BEYOND TODAY.
THE COMMAND IN RESPONSE THAT WAS
ON POST NEAR THE LOCATION 
STOPPED THE CARNAGE MOMENTS 
AFTER IT BEGAN.
ALSO THE WORK OF THE FIRST 
RESPONDERS AND PERSONNEL SURELY 
HELPED SAVE LIVES.
I WILL GIVE YOU MORE BUT RIGHT 
NOW, MAYOR DE BLASIO.
>> THANKS, COMMISSIONER.
A VERY PAINFUL DAY IN OUR CITY, 
HORRIBLE TRAGEDY ON THE WEST 
SIDE.
LET ME BE CLEAR, BASED ON THE 
INFORMATION WE AT THIS MOMENT, 
THIS WAS AN ACT OF TERROR, AND A
PARTICULARLY COWARDLY ACT OF 
TERROR, AIMED AT INNOCENT 
CIVILIANS, AIMED AT PEOPLE GOING
ABOUT THEIR LIVES WHO HAD NO 
IDEA ABOUT WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HIT
THEM.
WE AT THIS MOMENT, BASED ON THE 
INFORMATION WE HAVE, WE KNOW OF 
EIGHT INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
LOST THEIR LIVES.
OVER A DOZEN MORE INJURED.
WE KNOW THAT THIS ACTION WAS 
INTENDED TO BREAK OUR SPIRIT.
BUT WE ALSO KNOW NEW YORKERS ARE
STRONG, NEW YORKERS ARE 
RESILIENT AND OUR SPIRIT WILL 
NEVER BE MOVED BY AN ACT OF 
VIOLENCE AND ACT MEANT TO 
INTIMIDATE US.
WE HAVE BEEN TESTED BEFORE AS A 
CITY, VERY NEAR THE SITE OF 
TODAY'S TRAGEDY, AND NEW YORKERS
DO NOT GIVE IN, IN THE FACE OF 
THESE KINDS OF ACTIONS.
WE WILL RESPOND, AS WE ALWAYS 
DO, WE WILL BE UNDETERRED.
I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE AT 
NYPD, ALL OUR FIRST RESPONDERS 
FOR THEIR EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS 
IN THE MIDST OF THIS TRAGEDY 
STARTING WITH THE OFFICER WHO 
STOPPED THIS TRAGEDY FROM 
CONTINUING AND ALL THE FIRST 
RESPONDERS WHO CAME TO THE AID 
OF THOSE INJURIES.
AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY TO
GET ALL THE FACTS AND WHAT WE 
TELL YOU TODAY WILL, OF COURSE, 
BE PRELIMINARY.
BUT WE KNOW WE WILL GET DOWN TO 
THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HAPPENED.
I WANT TO ASK ALL NEW YORKERS, 
ALL AMERICANS, TO KEEP THE 
FAMILIES OF THOSE LOST IN YOUR 
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.
THEY WILL NEED OUR SUPPORT.
I WANT TO ASK ALL NEW YORKERS TO
BE VIGILANT.
WE KNOW IT'S HALLOWEEN NIGHT AND
WE KNOW IN THE DAYS AHEAD, 
PEOPLE WILL BE UNEASY.
WE ASK ALL NEW YORKERS TO LIVE 
BY THE IDEA OF IF YOU SEE 
SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING, TELL 
AN OFFICER IMMEDIATELY IF YOU 
SEE ANYTHING UNUSUAL, ANYTHING 
THAT WORRIES YOU.
BE VIGILANT AND KNOW THERE WILL 
BE EXTENSIVE DEPLOYMENTS OF NYPD
OFFICERS THIS EVENING AND 
THROUGHOUT THE DAYS AHEAD.
WE WILL ALSO KEEP YOU POSTED AS 
THIS INVESTIGATION CONTINUES AND
AS THE NYPD GAINS MORE 
INFORMATION.
GOVERNOR CUOMO.
>> THANK YOU.
FIRST, OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS 
ARE WITH THOSE NEW YORKERS WHO 
WE LOST TODAY.
IT REMINDS US ALL HOW PRECIOUS 
LIFE IS.
THEY LEFT THE HOUSE THIS 
MORNING, THEY WERE ENJOYING THE 
BEAUTIFUL WESTSIDE OF MANHATTAN,
ON A BEAUTIFUL FALL DAY, AND 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE 
RETURNING HOME.
THAT SHOCK AND THAT PAIN IS 
GOING TO BE VERY REAL.
OUR THOUGHTS AND OUR PRAYERS ARE
WITH ALL OF THEM.
OUR FIRST RESPONDERS DID AN 
EXTRAORDINARY JOB, THE NYPD, 
FDNY, FBI, NEW YORK STATE 
POLICE, EMS, THEY -- WE HAVE THE
FINEST SECURITY ON THE GLOBE, 
AND TO SEE THEM IN ACTION TODAY 
PROVED THAT ONCE AGAIN.
THE NEW TERRORIST TACTIC, WHICH 
THEY'VE CALLED FOR PUBLICLY, ARE
THESE LONE WOLVES THAT COMMIT AN
ACT OF TERROR.
THIS IS ALL VERY PRELIMINARY.
IT'S ONLY BEEN A COUPLE OF HOURS
BUT AT THIS POINT, THERE'S NO 
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST A WIDER PLOT
OR WIDER SCHEME, BUT THE ACTIONS
OF ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO MEANT TO 
CAUSE PAIN AND HARM AND PROBABLY
DEATH AND THE RESULTING TERROR.
THAT WAS THE PURPOSE.
WE WILL BE VIGILANT, MORE POLICE
EVERYWHERE.
YOU WILL SEE THEM IN THE 
AIRPORT, YOU WILL SEE THEM IN 
THE TUNNELS.
IT'S NOT BECAUSE THERE IS ANY 
EVIDENCE OF ANY ONGOING THREAT 
OR ANY ADDITIONAL THREAT, IT IS 
JUST OUT OF VIGILANCE AND OUT OF
CAUTION.
THE TRUTH IS NEW YORK IS AN 
INTERNATIONAL SYMBOL OF FREEDOM 
AND DEMOCRACY.
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE.
AND WE ARE PROUD OF IT.
THAT ALSO MAKES US A TARGET FOR 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE THOSE 
CONCEPTS.
WE'VE LIVED WITH THIS BEFORE, 
WE'VE FELT THE PAIN BEFORE, WE 
FEEL THE PAIN TODAY.
BUT WE GO FORWARD TOGETHER AND 
WE GO FORWARD STRONGER THAN 
EVER.
WE WON'T LET THEM WIN.
IF WE CHANGE OUR LIVES, WE 
CONTORT OURSELVES TO THEM, THEN 
THEY WIN AND WE LOSE.
WE'LL GO ABOUT OUR BUSINESS, 
AGAIN, THERE'S NO ONGOING 
THREAT, THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF 
THAT AT THIS TIME.
SO THERE'S NO REASON TO HAVE ANY
UNDUE ANXIETY.
YOU WILL SEE MORE SECURITY 
FORCES, BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE 
IT'S AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION AND
NOT A SIGNAL OF ANYTHING ELSE.
THERAL BE A CONTINUED 
INVESTIGATION AND JUSTICE WILL 
BE DONE.
BUT AGAIN, TO THOSE WE LOST, 
THEY'RE IN OUR THOUGHTS AND OUR 
PRAYERS.
TO THE FIRST RESPONDERS, THANK 
YOU, THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE
JOB YOU DO.
YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE 
EVERYDAY AND YOU DO IT BETTER 
THAN ANYONE ELSE.
AND TO NEW YORKERS, NEW YORKERS 
LIVE YOUR LIFE AND DON'T LET 
THEM CHANGE US OR DETER US IN 
ANY MANNER, SHAPE OR FORM.
>> AMEN.
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANKS, GOVERNOR CUOMO, THANK
YOU, MR. MAYOR.
AS I SAID, I WILL GO THROUGH THE
CHRONOLOGY HERE.
I KNOW WHEN I'M DONE YOU WILL 
HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
WE WON'T GO TOO DEEP INTO IT.
IT'S ONLY TWO HOURS.
AFTER I GO THROUGH THE 
CHRONOLOGY, DAN WILL TALK ABOUT 
THE INJURIES.
AT 3:05 P.M., A MALE DRIVING A 
RENTED HOME DEPOT PICKUP TRUCK 
ENTERED THE WESTSIDE HIGHWAY 
BICYCLE PATH AT HALSTON STREET 
STRIKING A NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS
AND BICYCLISTS ON THE ROUTE.
AT CHAMBERS STREET IT COLLIDED 
WITH A SCHOOL BUS INJURING TWO 
ADULTS AND TWO CHILDREN.
THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK 
BRANDISHED TWO HANDGUNS.
A UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICER 
ASSIGNED TO THE FIRST PRECINCT 
CONFRONTED THE SUBJECT AND SHOT 
HIM IN THE ABDOMEN.
THE SUBJECT WAS WOUNDED AND 
TRANSPORTED TO THE LOCAL 
HOSPITAL.
THE PAINT BALL GUN AND PELLET 
GUN WERE RECOVERED AT THE SCENE.
THE SUBJECT'S IDENTITY IS NOT 
BEING RELEASED AT THIS TIME 
PENDING FURTHER INVESTIGATION.
AT THIS POINT, THERE ARE EIGHT 
FATALITIES REPORTED IN 
CONNECTION WITH THIS INCIDENT.
IN ADDITION, SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN INJURED AND COMMISSIONER 
KNIGHT FROM OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT 
WILL DISCUSS THAT.
DAN.
>> THANK YOU, JIM.
AS THE POLICE COMMISSIONER SAID,
SIX OF THE PEOPLE DIED, THEY 
WERE PRONOUNCED AT THE SCENE.
BETWEEN HALSTON STREET AND 
CHAMBERS STREET.
THEY WERE ALL MALES.
TWO OTHERS WERE TRANSPORTED IN 
TRAUMATIC ARREST AND WERE 
PRONOUNCED AT THE HOSPITAL.
WE ALSO TRANSPORTED 11 PEOPLE, 
ALL WITH SERIOUS BUT AT THIS 
MOMENT, NOT LIFE THREATENING 
INJURIES.
THE INJURIES ARE WHAT YOU MAY 
EXPECT AS A TRUCK WENT AT HIGH 
SPEED DOWN THAT BICYCLE PATH AND
STRUCK BICYCLISTS AND 
PEDESTRIANS.
THERE MAY BE MORE INJURIES AS 
PEOPLE SELF-EVACUATED AND WE 
WILL DETERMINE THAT LATER, AS WE
DO OUR SURVEY.
THAT'S THE PATIENT COUNT AND THE
DEATHS, AS WE KNOW IT NOW.
>> AT THIS POINT, WE WILL TAKE 
SOME QUESTIONS.
MILES, HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.
MILES.
>> THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME, 
TERROR ATTACKS, IN A TRUCK, THIS
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU 
 ALL THE TIME, 
TRUCK COMPANIES.
HAVE YOU GUYS TALKED TO HOME 
DEPOT RECENTLY ABOUT THIS KIND 
OF INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THIS?
>> JOHN, YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
THE PROGRAM A LITTLE BIT?
>> AS YOU KNOW, THROUGH THE 
SHIELD PROGRAM WE DO A VERY WIDE
OUTREACH AND WE HAVE JUST UNDER 
20,000 MEMBERS IN THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR.
AFTER ISIS, A MAGAZINE CAME OUT 
WITH THE ISSUE JUST ABOUT TWO 
YEARS AGO, AROUND THIS TIME OF 
YEAR, SUGGESTING CAR ATTACKS, 
YOU'LL RECALL ONE OF THE TARGETS
THEY SUGGESTED WAS THE 
THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE.
WE WENT AND DID EXTENSIVE 
OUTREACH TO THE TRUCK RENTAL 
BUSINESS.
WE VISITED OVER 148 TRUCK RENTAL
LOCATIONS IN THIS AREA.
THE OBVIOUS ONES, YU-HAUL, RYDE,
OTHERS IN THIS AREA AND WAYS TO 
COME FORWARD AFTER THE ATTACKS 
ON NICE.
WE PRET THOSE VISITS TWO MORE 
TIMES EATS TELEPHONIC OR E-MAIL 
GOING BACK TO THE SAME PLACES.
THE INDUSTRY HAS HAD A HIGH 
LEVEL OF AWARENESS ON THIS 
MATTER FROM THE NYPD.
>> IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT 
THIS SUSPECT IS A LONE WOLF, 
RADICALIZED HERE IN AMERICA 
OR -- 
>> IT'S WAY TOO EARLY TO DISCUSS
THAT.
THIS JUST HAPPENED TWO HOURS 
AGO.
THAT'S OF COURSE PART OF OUR 
INVESTIGATION.
>> POLICE ACTIVITY -- 
>> INITIALLY WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN BUT WE THOUGHT IT 
MIGHT NOT TO BE.
>> IF YOU HAD A RESIDENCE IN NEW
YORK -- 
>> THIS IS ALL PART OF THE 
INVESTIGATION.
DID HE HAVE A RESIDENCE IN NEW 
YORK -- 
>> AND WE HEARD SOME SCHOOLS 
WERE UNDER LOCKDOWN.
ANYTHING GOING ON OR ANYTHING 
PEOPLE IN THAT AREA SHOULD BE 
AWARE?
>> NO.
THIS INCIDENT IS OVER.
IT DID END BY THE HIGH SCHOOL 
AND WE HAD TO MAKE SURE ALL THE 
KIDS WERE TAKEN CARE OF AND HELD
THEM IN PLACE FOR A WHILE AND IT
WAS IMPORTANT WE DO THAT BUT 
THIS INCIDENT IS OVER.
HOLD ON.
DAVID.
>> DO YOU HAVE THE AGE OF THE 
SUSPECT AND VICTIMS.
WAS THERE ANY INDICATION EARLIER
THE MAN RESEMBLED -- 
>> HE'S A 29-YEAR-OLD MALE 
ARCHED I WON'T TALK ABOUT THE 
TRUCK RIGHT NOW.
>> CAN YOU CONFIRM IF HE AID 
ALLA AKBAR OR ANYTHING?
IF SO, IS THAT THE ONLY 
INDICATION THIS WOULD BE AN ACT 
OF TERRORISM?
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO LABEL 
THAT?
>> HE DID MAKE A STATEMENT WHEN 
HE EXITED THE VEHICLE.
YOU LOOK AT THE M.O. OF THE 
ATTACK, THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH 
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON.
THAT ALONG WITH THE STATEMENT 
LED US TO LABEL IT A TERRORIST 
EVENT.
NO, NOT RIGHT NOW.
>> DO YOU HAVE HIS NATIONALITY?
IS THERE ANY INTELLIGENCE THERE 
WAS SOMETHING IN THE WORKS?
>> AGAIN, TWO HOURS OLD AND 
WE'LL UPDATE YOU AS WE GO ALONG.
LENNY.
IT'S BEING CONDUCTED JOINTLY 
WITH THE NYPD AND FBI.
>> . 
>> FROM FLORIDA?
I'M NOT GOING INTO THAT.
JOHN.
JOHN, NOT RIGHT NOW, NO.
YES.
>> DID YOU MANAGE TO SECURE 
THE -- 
>> AFTER THE TIME SQUARE 
INCIDENT, I TALKED ABOUT THIS, 
ANY INCIDENT THAT HAPPENS IN NEW
YORK OR HAPPENS AROUND THE 
WORLD, WE HAVE TO LEARN FROM 
THAT, OF COURSE WE WILL TAKE A 
LOOK AT THAT.
>> . 
>> YEAH.
HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT 
HOSPITAL.
I WILL LET CHIEF GOMEZ TALK 
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR THE 
HALLOWEEN PARADE RIGHT NOW.
CARLOS.
>> IN LESS THAN 90 MINUTES A 
PARADE WILL KICK OFF.
WE WILL PROCEED WITH THE PARADE 
AND WE ADDED MORE RESOURCES AND 
POLICE OFFICERS, HEAVY WEAPONS 
TEAMS, BLOCK OF VEHICLES LEADING
TO THE ROUTE AS WELL AS MORE 
SAND TRUCKS.
THERE'S ALSO HEAVY WEAPONS 
SCENES BEING DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT
THE CITY AT KEY ICONIC 
LOCATIONS.
. 
>> THIS IS WHY WE DO 
INVESTIGATIONS.
INITIALLY, I'M SURE WHO EVER PUT
THAT OUT WASN'T SURE WHAT THE 
EVENT WAS.
NOW, TWO HOURS INTO IT, THIS IS 
THE DETERMINATION THAT WE MADE.
IN THE FIRST ROW.
YEAH.
>> TOO EARLY IN THE 
INVESTIGATION TO KNOW THAT.
ROCCO 
[ REPORTER REQUASKING A QUESTIO.
>> I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE VIDEO
YET.
WE'RE RETRIEVING AS MUCH VIDEO 
AS POSSIBLE.
HE ENTERED THE BIKE PATH AT 
HALSTON STREET AND EXITED THE 
BIKE PATH AT CHAMBERS STREET 
WHEN HE COLLIDED WITH THE SCHOOL
BUS.
THERE ARE NO INTERSECTIONS 
BETWEEN THOSE TWO.
I'M CHECKING IN THE BACK THERE.
DAN, DO YOU HAVE THAT?
>> AMONG THE INJURED THAT ARE 
SERIOUS, BUT NOT 
LIFE-THREATENING.
>> THERE ARE INJURED SERIOUS BUT
NOT LIFE-THREATENING.
YES.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT 
WHERE THE HOME DEPOT WAS RENTED 
FROM JUST YET.
DO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ON 
THE BUS?
>> TWO ADULTS.
>> TWO ADULTS AND TWO CHILDREN 
ON THE SCHOOL BUS.
LISA.
DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S PART OF THE 
INVESTIGATION.
NO, WE DON'T HAVE THAT YET.
>> THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION 
TO BE DONE.
WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A 
PRELIMINARY AT THIS POINT.
WE WILL HAVE MORE LATER.
WE WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER 
BRIEFING AS MORE INFO BECOMES 
AVAILABLE.
I WILL AT THIS POINT ASK YOU TO 
WAIT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION AT 
EITHER BRIEFING.
>> LOOK, I'LL JUST CLOSE US OFF 
HERE BY SAYING, LOOK, NYPD IS 
INVESTIGATING THIS WITH OUR 
FEDERAL PARTNERS, WITH OUR STATE
PARTNERS.
THERE WILL BE A VERY VERY 
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AS 
GOVERNOR CUOMO SAID, AS 
COMMISSIONER O'NEILL SAID, 
PEOPLE SHOULD GOO ABOUT THEIR 
BUSINESS KNOWING NYPD IS OUT 
ENF
IN FORCE WITH OUR PARTNER 
AGENCIES FOR PEOPLE'S SAFETY.
BOTTOM LINE WE WILL GO ABOUT OUR
BUSINESS IN THIS CITY AND WILL 
NOT BE DETERRED AND WE WILL GET 
YOU UPDATES LATER ON IN THE 
EVENING.
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT, THE MAYOR 
OF NEW YORK, BILL DE BLASIO, 
GOVERNOR CUOMO AND COMMISSIONER 
O'NEILL SAYING THIS WAS AN ACT 
OF TERROR IN NEW YORK CITY 
UNFOLDING AT 3:05.
WHEN A MAN IN A WHITE PICKUP 
TRUCK WENT DOWN A BIKE PATH AT 
HALSTON STREET DROVE AT 60 MILES
AN HOUR, BARRELLING THROUGH 
CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS BEFORE 
HE HIT A SCHOOL BUS CARRYING 
CHILDREN AND HE RAN OUT OF THE 
CAR WAVING EITHER A PAINT OR 
PELLET GUN SHOUTING ALLAH.
WE NOW KNOW WHO THIS INDIVIDUAL 
IS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.
"ABC NEWS" CONFIRMED FROM LAW 
ENFORCEMENT FORCES HIS NAME.
HE HAS AN ID FROM TAMPA, 
FLORIDA, HE IS 29 YEARS OLD.
NO KNOWN CRIMINAL RECORD.
WE'RE STILL CHECKING ON THAT.
>> THAT IS WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT 
NOW.
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHETHER HE
HAD ANY HELP.
YOU SAW OUR COMMISSIONER SAYING 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO GREAT 
DETAIL SAYING THIS INVESTIGATION
IS TWO HOURS OLD AND A JOINT 
INVESTIGATION WITH THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
NOW THEY HAVE THE NAME AND WILL 
LOOK AT THIS IS SOCIAL NETWORK.
RIGHT NOW, MY SOURCES ARE SAYING
IT LOOKS LIKE A LONE WOLF 
INCIDENT BASED ON THE 
INFORMATION THEY HAVE SO FAR.
GEORGE, I'M BEING TOLD THE 
PRIMARY THING THAT POINTS 
TOWARDS TERRORISM IS WHAT HE 
SAID WHEN HE GOT OUT OF THE CAR.
THEY'RE STILL DOING THE 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION.
YELLING ALLAH AKBAR, AND YOU 
HEARD THE POLICE CHIEF 
COMMISSIONER SAY, BASED ON THAT 
AND THE MODE OF ATTACK, THAT IS 
WHY THEY'RE DETERMINING THIS IS 
AN ACT OF TERRORISM AT THIS 
POINT.
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE
ON HIS BACKGROUND.
AGAIN, WE HAVE THE THREE SOURCES
GIVING US THE NAME OF THE 
SUSPECT A 29-YEAR-OLD FROM 
UZBEKISTAN.
AGAIN, AN INTERNATIONAL AND 
NATIONAL INVESTIGATION INVOLVING
EVERY DATA BANK THE UNITED 
STATES HAS.
WE WILL TALK WITH OUR FOREIGN 
PARTNERS.
EVERYTHING IS BEING PUT FORTH TO
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHERE THIS 
MAN HAS BEEN, WHO HE'S BEEN 
COMMUNICATING WITH, WHAT HE'S 
BEEN LOOKING AT ONLINE, ALL OF 
THAT WILL BE DONE PRONTO.
>> THAT INVESTIGATION GOING ON.
I GO TO THE SCENE NOW AS WE 
AGAIN SHOW THAT VIDEO OF THE 
GUNMAN CARRYING A PAINT BALL GUN
JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR.
GIO BENITIZ WAS ON THE SCENE 
JUST AS SCHOOLS WERE BEING LET 
OUT RIGHT BY A SCHOOL IN THE 
AREA AND HE EVENTUALLY HIT A 
SCHOOL BUS CARRYING SPECIAL 
NEEDS CHILDREN.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WE ALSO LEARNED THERE IS A 
COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THIS AREA.
ONE OF THE MAIN BUILDINGS FOR 
THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS WHERE 
THIS HAPPENED.
THE BUREAU OF MANHATTAN 
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND WE'RE TOLD
BY SOME STUDENTS HERE THE 
SECURITY IN OTHER BUILDINGS JUST
WENT UP INTO THEIR CLASSROOMS 
AND SAID, STAY PUT, WE'RE NOT 
LETTING YOU OUT BECAUSE WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE SEEN MORE AMBULANCES 
COME THROUGH HERE.
THAT'S THE WORRY, ALL THESE 
STUDENTS WHO WERE HERE WERE 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF AN ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL HERE.
WE HAVE A TON OF STUDENTS IN 
COLLEGE, HIGH SCHOOL AND, OF 
COURSE, ELEMENTARY, MANY OF THEM
IN THEIR HALLOWEEN COSTUMES JUST
OUT IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, 
GEORGE.
>> YOU HEARD THE FORMER CHIEF OF
POLICE, RAY KELLY, OF NEW YORK 
CITY, YOU SEE THAT SCENE RIGHT 
THERE, THAT BICYCLE JUST MANGLED
BY A DRIVER GOING 50, 60 MILES 
AN HOUR.
THEY TALKED ABOUT A HEIGHTENED 
POLICE PRESENCE ACROSS NEW YORK 
CITY TONIGHT BUT THE HALLOWEEN 
PARADE AND TRADITION IN NEW YORK
CITY WILL GO ON.
>> IT WILL GO ON.
I'M SURE IT WILL BE VERY WELL 
PROTECTED.
OBVIOUSLY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES 
WILL BE PROVIDED AND HEAVY 
WEAPONS.
WE KNOW BLOCKER CARS WILL BE PUT
IN PLACE AND ACTUAL BLOCKS WILL 
BE MOVED THERE BY THE NYPD 
COUNTER-TERRORISM PEOPLE.
I THINK IT WILL BE VERY WELL 
PROTECTED.
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE CONCERNED 
ABOUT SOMETHING HAPPENING IN 
SOME OTHER PLACE IN THE CITY.
>> YOU HEARD GOVERNOR CUOMO 
TALKING ABOUT NEW YORK BEING AN 
INTERNATIONAL CITY WHICH MAKES 
NEW YORK AN INEVITABLE TARGET.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
10 MILLION PEOPLE HERE ON A 
BUSINESS DAY.
WE WANT FREE AND OPEN ACCESS.
THESE THINGS UNFORTUNATELY ARE 
THE TYPE OF EXPERIENCE WE'RE 
GOING TO HAVE IN THIS POST 9/11 
WORLD.
>> IT'S THE TYPE OF EXPERIENCE 
WE HAVE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND 
AGAIN.
ALL ACROSS EUROPE AND IN THE 
UNITED STATES.
THE ATTACK WE'VE SEEN IN NICE, 
LONDON AND HERE ON HALLOWEEN 
NIGHT.
>> NEW YORK CITY ALSO THE HOME 
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.
JOHN IS AT THE WHITE HOUSE NOW 
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
BRIEFED AND SEEING HIS FIRST 
TWEETS.
>> THE PRESIDENT WAS BRIEFED BY 
CHIEF OF STAFF, JOHN KELLY AND 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO GET UPDATES 
WE JUST HEARD FROM THE 
PRESIDENT.
IN NEW YORK CITY, LOOKS LIKE 
ANOTHER ATTACK BY A VERY SICK 
AND DERANGED PERSON.
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FOLLOWING 
THIS CLOSELY, ALL IN CAPS, NOT 
IN THE USA!
WE ALSO HEARD FROM THE FIRST 
LADY ABOUT THIS ATTACK VIA 
TWITTER.
SHE TWEETED MY HEART BREAKS FOR 
NEW YORK CITY TODAY.
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS AS WE 
MONITOR THIS SITUATION.
>> PERHAPS WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM 
THE WHITE HOUSE LATER THIS 
EVENING.
CAN WE SEE THE DRIVER THERE, AS 
HE CAME OUT OF THE CAR WAVING 
HIS GUNS, WAS SHOT BY POLICE.
SO FAR, NO CLAIM OF 
RESPONSIBILITY BY ANY TERROR 
GROUP.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
NO CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY.
POLICE ARE BASING THEIR 
INFORMATION THIS WAS A TERROR 
ATTACK BY SHOUTING ALLAH AKBAR 
AND HAD TWO WEAPONS INOPERABLE, 
PAINT GUNS OR PELLET GUNS.
WHAT THEY WILL DO, THEY WILL 
TAKE THAT LICENSE PLATE AND 
BACKTRACK WHERE THAT CAR CAME 
FROM.
>> THEY DID NOT SAY -- THEY KNOW
IT WAS A RENTAL CAR AND FROM 
HOME DEPOT.
THEY DID NOT SAY WHERE IT WAS 
FROM.
NO INFORMATION YET.
>> HOME DEPOT CONFIRMED IT WAS 
ONE OF THEIR CARS AND THEY WILL 
INSTANTLY KNOW BASED ON THE 
INFORMATION WHERE THAT'S FROM.
LOOKING AT THE LICENSE PLATE 
NUMBER, COMMISSIONER KELLY 
HELPED INSTALL THAT SYSTEM AND 
THEY CAN SEE IF THERE IS ANYBODY
ELSE THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED.
>> THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION, 
PETER THOMAS, SENIOR JUSTICE 
COMMENT.
THE MAYOR LEANED INTO THE IDEA 
IT WAS A LONE WOLF AND THE 
POLICE COMMISSIONER DIDN'T SAY 
THEY KNEW FOR SURE. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S TOO EARLY.
UNTIL YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT HIS
FRIENDS, FAMILY, WHAT HE'S BEEN 
LOOKING AT, YOU WON'T KNOW.
IT FITS THE PATTERN OF LONE 
WOLVES INSPIRED BY WHAT THEY MAY
HAVE BEEN SEEING ON THE 
INTERNET.
GEORGE, I CAN TELL YOU, GIVEN 
THE FREQUENCY, INCREASING 
FREQUENCY WE'RE SEEING THESE 
KIND OF EVENTS, LAW ENFORCEMENT 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE GOING TO 
BE RETHINKING, THEY'RE PUTTING 
OUT NOTICE AND WARNING.
THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH 
SOMETHING MORE THAN THEY 
CURRENTLY HAVE BECAUSE CLEARLY, 
THIS IS THE MODE OF ATTACK NOT 
JUST USED BY INTERNATIONAL 
ISLAMIST TERRORISTS OR LONE 
WOLVES, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, THAT PERSON 
INVOLVED IN THAT RACIALLY 
MOTIVATED CASE DECIDED TO KILL 
PEOPLE USING THE SAME METHOD.
>> VERY LOW TECH, USING A PICKUP
TRUCK AND PAINT BALL GUN, NOT 
EVEN A REAL GUN.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS SO 
DIFFICULT.
YOU HEARD THE MAYOR SAY AGAIN, 
SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.
WHAT COULD YOU SEE HERE?
THE GUY MADE A TURN ON HALSTON 
STREET AND STARTED TO PLOW DOWN 
BICYCLISTS.
>> IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY, 
PROBABLY A MINUTE TO GET FROM 
FOUR BLOCKS DOWN FROM HALSTON 
STREET.
I ALSO THINK THIS INDIVIDUAL IS 
LOOKING TO DIE.
HE HAD TWO GUNS NOT LETHAL 
WEAPONS AND KNEW THERE WOULD BE 
SOME CONFRONTATION ULTIMATELY 
WITH THE POLICE.
HE WANTED TO BE SHOT AND KILLED.
>> IN THAT CASE, WHAT WAS THE 
ENGAGEMENT FOR POLICE?
WERE THEY SHOOTING TO KILL OR 
INJURE?
>> NO.
YOU SHOOT TO STOP.
SHOOT TO INJURE TAKES AN AWFUL 
LOT OF SKILL.
HE HAD TWO REPS AND THEY WERE 
APPARENTLY POINTED AT THE 
POLICE.
AT LEAST THEY KNEW HE HAD TWO 
WEAPONS IN HIS CUSTODY.
IT'S CERTAINLY A REASONABLE 
ACTION ON THE PART OF THE POLICE
OFFICER TO USE HIS WEAPON AND 
YOU STOP HIM.
YOU SHOOT FOR MASS, YOU DON'T 
SHOOT TO WOUND.
YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT.
>> BACK ON THE SCENE NOW, GIO 
BENITIZ, YOU THERE?
>> YEAH, GEORGE.
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT 
COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE AREA.
WE'RE WITH ONE OF THE STUDENTS.
TELL ME, WHAT DID YOU SEE?
>> I JUST SAW HIM WALKING WITH 
HIS GUN DOWN THE SIDEWALK.
THAT'S ALL I SEE.
>> YOU ACTUALLY SAW THE GUNMAN?
>> YEAH.
>> WITH THE GUN.
AT THAT POINT, WHAT WERE YOU 
SEEING?
AT THAT POINT IT MUST HAVE BEEN 
CRAZY AT YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
BECAUSE WE'RE TOLD A LOT OF 
SECURITY GUARDS WERE STARTING TO
LOCK IT DOWN.
>> YEAH.
I WAS OUTSIDE.
>> YOU WERE ON THE STREET?
>> YEAH.
ON THE STREETS, YEAH.
>> DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING?
>> I DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING, NO.
>> BY THE TIME YOU GOT OUT 
THERE, WERE THERE PEOPLE ON THE 
GROUND, WHAT WAS GOING ON?
>> I WAS UPSTAIRS DOWN THERE.
I JUST SAW HIM WALKING, I DIDN'T
SEE THE ROAD UP THERE.
I COULDN'T SEE THE ROAD.
I WAS UP THERE.
I JUST SAW HIM WALKING DOWN THE 
SIDEWALK WITH HIS GUN AND 
HOODIE, MAYBE.
I HAVE A VIDEO OF IT.
HE WAS WEARING A HOODIE, 
SOMETHING, I THINK, YEAH.
>> Reporter: I CAN JUST IMAGINE 
WE HAVE AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
HERE AND YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE.
THERE'S ONE MORE.
>> THE HIGH SCHOOL THERE, A LOT 
OF STUDENTS ARE IN THIS AREA ALL
THE TIME. 
>> YEAH.
WE WALK THERE EVERY TIME. 
>> RIGHT ON THE WEST SIDE 
HIGHWAY?
>> YEAH.
>> PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW NEW 
YORK CITY -- 
>> I JUST MOVED HERE FOUR MONTHS
AGO, THIS IS SOMETHING SHOCKING 
FOR ME TO SEE THIS IN NEW YORK 
IN FRONT OF ONE WORLD TRADE 
CENTER.
>> Reporter: RIGHT THERE.
>> RIGHT THERE.
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.
IT WAS SOMETHING SHOCKING FOR 
ME.
>> HAMZA, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GEORGE, YOU'RE HEARING IT RIGHT 
HERE, SO MANY STUDENTS IN THIS 
AREA AND WHAT MAKES IT SO 
DANGEROUS IN THIS PARTICULAR 
AREA, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS 
WORLD TRADE CENTER AREA, YOU 
THINK IT'S JUST A FINANCIAL 
DISTRICT.
NOT TRUE.
THERE'S A PARK RIGHT THERE WE 
SAW KIDS PLAYING IN THIS PARK.
THIS IS VERY MUCH A COMMUNITY 
HERE, GEORGE.
>> PEOPLE ARE SAYING BEFORE HE 
DID THIS, HE SAID ALLAH AKBAR.
>> WHAT?
>> THE THING, HE WAS FROM THE 
MIDDLE EAST AND MUSLIM AND SAID 
ALLAH AKBAR.
LIKE MANY SAY RIGHT NOW.
WANT TO CLEAR HE WAS NOT FROM 
MIDDLE EAST.
YOU CAN TELL SOMEONE WAS FROM 
MIDDLE EAST.
HE WAS WEARING A HOODIE AND ALL,
WHITE AND SPANISH AND ALL AND 
YOU COULDN'T TELL HE'S FROM 
MIDDLE EAST OR MUSLIM AND SAID 
ALLAH AKBAR.
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY 
IMPORTANT MOMENT, WHY WE ALWAYS 
TRY TO BE SO CAREFUL IN THE 
INITIAL MINUTES AND HOURS AFTER 
AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS.
LOTS OF PEOPLE CAN BE ON THE 
SCENE AND HEAR AND SEE DIFFERENT
THINGS.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
YOU SEE THAT WHEN YOU QUESTION 
WITNESSES.
YOU CAN BE TOTALLY OFF.
YOU CAN IMAGINE.
THE CAMERAS ARE SO IMPORTANT 
THESE DAYS TO VERIFY THAT. 
>> AND NEW YORK CITY HAS A 
PROLIFERATION OF CAMERAS.
>> NEW YORK CITY HAS CAMERAS.
WE ALSO SAW PEOPLE ON THE SCENE 
PULLED OUT THEIR PHONES AND TOOK
A VIDEO.
THERE'S SOMETHING OF A PATTERN 
HERE, NOT ONLY CITIES BEING 
TARGETED IN THIS LOW TECH WAY, 
GENERALLY IN EUROPE THERE HAVE 
BEEN MORE INCIDENCES WITH MORE 
COORDINATION, HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES, MORE LONE WOLFS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IN FRANCE AND LONDON, THERE HAVE
BEEN TEAMS THAT HAVE DONE THE 
ATTACKS FROM THE VEHICLES AND 
JUMPED OUT OF THE CARS AND BEGUN
FIRING OR USING KNIVES.
THAT MUST BE ONE OF THE GREAT 
CONCERNS INITIALLY HERE THERE 
MIGHT BE OTHERS BUT HASN'T BEEN 
THE CASE ACCORDING TO 
COMMISSIONER O'NEILL.
THAT HAS BEEN THE PATTERN A TEAM
OF ATTACKERS GET IN A VEHICLE 
AND TAKE OFF ON CIVILIANS.
>> IN SOME INSTANCES, RAY KELLY,
YOU HAVE SOME CHATTER AND SOME 
ADVANCE NOTICE AND GO BACK TO 
TRY TO PIECE IT BACK TOGETHER.
WITH A LONE WOLF, NONE AT ALL.
>> AND THEY'RE USING ENCRYPTION 
THESE DAYS.
IT'S THE TYPE OF THING VERY 
DIFFICULT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO
PENETRATE.
THEY'RE USING CERTAIN APPS THAT 
MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET 
INTO THEIR COMMUNICATION.
SO THEIR TRADE CRAFT IS 
IMPROVING.
THEY DON'T COMMUNICATE.
THEY'RE PERHAPS ON THE INTERNET 
READING BUT NOT NECESSARILY 
COMMUNICATING.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE SAW, 
BRIAN ROSS, PEOPLE CAN SEE 
MESSAGES THEY TRACK WITH 
PROBLEMS THEY'RE ALREADY HAVING 
IN THEIR LIVES AND MAY BE 
MENTALLY ILL UNBALANCED IN SOME 
WAY AND TAKE OFF.
>> THEY USE THIS FOR EXCUSE AS A
LIFE THAT HAS FAILED AND SEE 
THIS AS A WAY OUT OF YOUR LIFE.
YOU SUGGESTED THIS WAS SOMEBODY 
WHO WANTED TO BE SHOT AND SHOT 
IN THE ABDOMEN BY POLICE AND IN 
CUSTODY TONIGHT.
IT'S CERTAINLY CLEAR WE WILL 
KNOW SOON, VERY SOON A LOT ABOUT
HIM.
>> WHERE HE'S FROM.
WE BELIEVE HE WAS FROM TAMPA AND
WE WILL FIND OUT OTHER PLACES HE
MAY HAVE LIVED.
WE KNOW WHERE HE RENTED THE CAR 
FROM.
AS MUCH AS WE LEARN SOMETIMES 
THAT STILL DOESN'T GIVE THE 
ANSWER I HAVE IN MY HEAD, THAT 
LAS VEGAS SHOOTING, WE STILL 
DON'T KNOW WHAT DROVE HIM.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THAT IS ONE BIG MYSTERY.
COULD BE THIS INDIVIDUAL JUST 
WANTED TO BE -- HAVE HIS NAME IN
HISTORY, A BIZARRE DESIRE TO BE 
KNOWN, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE 
SHOOTER IN LAS VEGAS.
SO FAR, NOTHING HAS COME UP TO 
SHOW HE'S PARTICULARLY ABERRANT.
>> ONE OF THE KEY THINGS OF THIS
INCIDENT, I WANT TO KNOW IF THE 
SUSPECT, THE DRIVER WAS IN THE 
AREA OR DELIBERATELY CAME.
>> RIGHT.
>> TO NEW YORK CITY.
>> HE DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE ANY
KNOWN NEW YORK ADDRESS.
WE HAVE SEEN ADDRESS IN OTHER 
STATES, INCLUDING TAMPA, 
FLORIDA.
WHAT BROUGHT HIM HERE AND WHY IS
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WANT TO 
KNOW RIGHT AWAY.
THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE 
INDICATION, DID THEY SEND HIM 
HERE OR READ SOMETHING OR 
INSPIRED?
THAT WILL BE A KEY QUESTION THE 
FBI WANTS TO PURSUE INFORMS OF 
TERRORISM.
IS THIS SOMEBODY INSPIRED OVER 
WHAT THEY READ OVER THE INTERNET
OR DIRECTED.
MOST LIKELY INSPIRED.
>> YOU HEARD THE MAYOR SAY THIS 
IS A JOINT EFFORT, FBI TAKING 
THE LEAD?
>> IT'S JOINT.
THE NYPD HAS VAST RESOURCES AS 
RAY KELLY WILL TELL YOU.
WHERE THE FBI WILL BE 
PARTICULARLY USEFUL IS WORKING 
WITH STATE PARTNERS.
THEY WILL BE IN CONTACT WITH 
AUTHORITIES AND EVERY 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY WE HAVE WILL
BE INVOLVED LOOKING AT THIS 
MAN'S BACKGROUND AND WANT TO 
KNOW DID HE RECENTLY TRAVEL 
OVERSEAS AND IF SO, WHERE DID HE
GO?
WHO MIGHT HE HAVE MET WITH?
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THEY TRAIN 
FOR EVERY DAY TO GET INFORMATION
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IN A 
NAME SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
CAN HAVE ASSESSMENT OF WHAT ARE 
WE LOOKING AT?
IS THERE A POSSIBILITY OF MORE 
COMING?
RIGHT NOW, THAT IS THE EFFORT TO
DETERMINE EXACTLY WHO WE'RE 
DEALING WITH AND WHAT IS THE 
POTENTIAL THERE COULD BE 
SOMETHING ELSE.
AGAIN, NO INDICATION OF THAT BUT
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
BRIAN ROSS, YOU WANT TO KNOW IF 
THEY WENT OVERSEAS.
IN THIS SITUATION, IT DOESN'T 
TAKE ANY TRAINING AT ALL.
>> NONE.
EXTREMELY LOW TECH.
THE ABILITY TO RENT A TRUCK AND 
MOE DOWN CIVILIANS, IN THIS CASE
BICYCLISTS ON A BIKE PATH NOT 
PROTECTED BY THE STANDS AND 
BARRICADES ESTABLISHED IN TIME 
SQUARE.
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO 
ASK, WE ALL KNOW IN WASHINGTON, 
D.C. IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE
YOU SEE STANDS AND BARRIERS AND 
IN TIME SQUARE AND OTHER FEDERAL
BUILDINGS.
YOU CAN'T HAVE THOSE TYPES OF 
BARRIERS EVERYWHERE, YOU 
COULDN'T GET AROUND THE CITY.
>> AND BY THE WAY, THEY'RE VERY 
EXPENSIVE AND NOT EASY.
AND EVEN IN TIME SQUARE THEY 
CAN'T GET AROUND IT BECAUSE OF 
THE COMPLEXITY.
TO HAVE THEM EVERYWHERE IS 
UNREALISTIC.
>> BACK ON THE SCENE, RIGHT NOW,
RETURNING TO ANY KIND OF 
NORMALCY?
>> Reporter: GEORGE, POLICE ARE 
STARTING TO LET LOCAL RESIDENTS 
IN THIS AREA CROSS THE STREET.
NOT A WHOLE LOT CHANGED OTHER 
THAN THAT.
WE KEEP SEEING NUMEROUS POLICE 
VEHICLES HEADED TOWARDS THE 
CRIME SCENE.
WE SAW HEAVY EMERGENCY SERVICES 
EQUIPMENT, BIG LIGHTS GETTING 
READY FOR A LONG NIGHT TO 
PROCESS THAT SCENE.
WE HAVE SEEN THE FBI RESPONSE 
TEAM AS WELL.
INTERESTING, WE'RE SEEING A LOT 
OF NEW YORKERS GATHERING AROUND 
SOAKING UP WHAT HAS HAPPENED, A 
LOT OF PEOPLE ON THEIR PHONES, 
GOING LIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, 
DESCRIBING THE SCENE DOWN HERE, 
KIND OF SURREAL FOR A LOT OF 
PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THIS AREA 
WHO HAVE FEARED THIS AND HERE IT
IS.
WE HEARD FROM THE MAYOR AND FROM
THE GOVERNOR THAT NEW YORKERS, 
THEY WANT THEM TO BE VIGILANT 
TONIGHT.
THEY WANT THEM TO BE VIGILANT 
ALWAYS, LIVE BY THAT RULE, IF 
YOU SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING.
THE MAYOR AND GOVERNOR, TELLING 
PEOPLE TO GO ABOUT THEIR 
BUSINESS.
DO NOT LET THIS STOP YOU.
THEY SAID, THERE WILL BE EXTRA 
POLICE ALL OVER THE CITY 
TONIGHT.
EXPECT TO SEE HEAVY GUN TEAMS 
AND SAND TRUCKS.
THEY WILL LET THAT WEST VILLAGE 
PARADE GO AHEAD.
IT IS BUSINESS AS USUAL.
>> THANK YOU.
>> IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO SEND 
THAT MESSAGE.
>> THINGS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD
MADE PEOPLE UNEASY AND THIS 
COMPOUNDS THIS.
VERY IMPORTANT TO LET THEM KNOW 
THEY'LL BE PROTECTED AND A LOT 
OF OF ADDITIONAL SECURITY NOT 
ONLY AT THE PARADE BUT OTHER 
PLACES IN THE CITY AND THERE 
WILL BE OTHER SMALLER 
CELEBRATIONS.
IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT, IT'S THIS 
POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THE
SIZE AND EQUIPMENT IT HAS.
>> COUNTER-EXPERT JOINING US NOW
FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., ONE OF 
THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT IS THE PATTERN WE'VE SEEN 
FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS 
EVER SINCE THE CALL WENT OUT 
FROM ISIS, FIND A WAY TO ATTACK 
IN ANY WAY YOU CAN.
LOW TECH ATTACKS, MAJOR CAPITALS
ALL OVER THE WORLD.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.
EVERY TIME THIS HAPPENS IT 
INSPIRES THE THOUGHT IN ANOTHER 
POTENTIAL ATTACKER, MAYBE I CAN 
DO THAT.
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THAT HARD.
MAYBE THIS IS THE WAY I CAN 
CONTRIBUTE.
THIS IS A CHRONIC CONDITION FOR 
CITIES AROUND THE WORLD.
ISIS IS NOT DEFEATED, ONLY 
DEFEATED IN THE BATTLEFIELD AND 
NOT DEFEATED ON THE STREETS.
EVERY CITY NEEDS TO LOOK AT 
EVERY EVENT AND SEE IF IT CAN 
BLOCK THOSE ACCESS POINTS.
AS RAY KELLY SAID, WITH SAND 
TRUCKS AND POLICE CARS.
>> EVERY CITY HAS TO DO IT, I 
WONDER HOW WE ALL HANDLE IT.
YOU SAY PEOPLE SEE THIS, THEY 
GET INSPIRED BY IT.
IT COULD INSPIRE SOMEONE ELSE TO
GO DO IT.
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY AND HOW WE HANDLE
THIS?
>> IT MEANS IF WE THINK WE KNOW 
SOMEONE WHO IS ACTING 
DIFFERENTLY, IF THEY SUDDENLY 
BECOME VERY RELIGIOUS IN ISLAM, 
THEY'RE GOING TO STRANGE 
WEBSITES, BEING SECRETIVE, 
MEETING WITH NEW PEOPLE, YOU 
NEED TO TELL SOMEBODY.
TELL YOUR MOM, TELL ANOTHER 
FRIEND, IF YOU SEE THAT KIND OF 
ODD CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR, DON'T 
JUST DO NOTHING.
>> AND IT OFTEN OR NOT DOES 
PRECEDE THE ATTACKS?
>> IT USUALLY DOES.
>> AND ON THE SCENE AS WELL, 
WE'VE HEARD FROM THE OFFICIALS, 
THEY WANT EVERYONE DOWN IN NEW 
YORK CITY TO GO ABOUT THEIR 
LIVES, TO BE VIGILANT BUT ALSO 
TO CONTINUE.
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY, GEORGE.
THEY TALKED ABOUT THAT 9/11 
MEMORIAL BEING BLOCKS AWAY, THAT
REMINDER WHAT NEW YORK HAS 
ALREADY BEEN THROUGH.
THIS STORY NOW, WHERE WE'VE BEEN
HEARING FROM ALL OF THESE 
COLLEGE STUDENTS NOW, SO MANY 
HAVE BEEN TELLING US THEY WERE 
ON LOCKDOWN AROUND HERE, WE'RE 
STILL SEEING SO MANY STUDENTS IN
THIS AREA.
POLICE ARE STILL HERE.
THE SCENE SEEMS TO BE CALMING 
DOWN JUST A TAD, GEORGE.
WE'RE SEEING LESS POLICE, BUT 
STILL VERY VERY MUCH, A BIG 
POLICE PRESENCE HERE AS THEY TRY
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT ON HERE.
>> LET'S RECAP WHAT WE KNOW NOW,
EIGHT PEOPLE DEAD IN NEW YORK 
CITY, HAPPENED AROUND 3:05 P.M.
11 INJURED.
PERPETRATOR DRIVING A WHITE 
PICKUP TRUCK.
WE KNOW WHO HE IS AND IN CUSTODY
RIGHT NOW.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
HIS NAME IS SAYFULLO SAIPOV, 29 
YEARS OLD, FROM TAMPA FLORIDA.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MOTIVATED 
HIM, WHERE HE'S FROM, WHETHER 
HE'S AN AMERICAN CITIZEN OR NOT.
AND RAY KELLY, FORMER POLICE OF 
CHIEF NOW BEING LED BY THE NEW 
YORK POLICE, PHISH, RUNNING DOWN
EVERY POSSIBLE CONTACT THIS MAN 
MAY HAVE HAD.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
RUNNING DOWN CONTACTS AND MANY 
WITNESS REPORTS AND TALKING TO 
MANY MORE WITNESSES AS THE NIGHT
GOES ON.
>> AN ACT OF TERROR HERE IN NEW 
YORK CITY, 3:00 P.M., 11 
INJURED, EIGHT DEAD, THREE 
PEOPLE IN CUSTODY.
WE WILL GO OFF THE AIR RIGHT NOW
AND FOR MANY ON THE WEST COAST 
YOU WILL GO TO YOUR LOCAL NEWS 
AND WE WILL HAVE A FULL REPORT 
ON "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT."
>>> THIS HAS BEEN A SPECIAL 
REPORT FROM "ABC NEW
