1
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,960
My husband was an
activist from El Salvador.

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,400
One time, he left on a
trip in about November

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,600
and I didn’t hear a word
from him until February.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,640
Finally, he called and
asked me to meet him

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,550
in Mexico City the next day.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,440
We had about one day
and one night together.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,530
I knew that going
back to El Salvador

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,810
would be really dangerous.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,550
I also knew that if he
couldn’t do the one thing that

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,330
was the most important
to him, that it would be

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,570
like he wasn’t really living.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,310
A few weeks after I got home, 
I found out that I was pregnant.

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,650
A few weeks after
that, I found out

14
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,540
that Wilfredo had been killed.

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,250
I was just so glad that he
was leaving part of himself

16
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,130
with me.

17
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,560
I named him Daniel, a
pseudonym that his father used.

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,970
Having Danny in my life
was like having a light.

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,860
I was grieving and then I
had this beautiful baby.

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,870
I thought about, even
though Wilfredo isn’t here,

21
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,670
how can I raise Danny in a
way that would make him proud?

22
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,250
But on the other hand, 
I didn’t want Danny

23
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,530
to feel like he had to
replace his father in any way.

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,730
And so I wrote him a
letter and I promised him

25
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,070
that I was going to
let him be who he was

26
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,930
and allow him to
walk his own path.

27
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,600
That promise turned out
to be really important.

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,200
A few weeks before
Danny’s fourth birthday,

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,520
he told me that he wanted to
be a princess for Halloween.

30
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,640
This wasn’t really a
big surprise to me.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,860
From the time he was
1 and 1/2 years old,

32
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,760
he had this Barbie that he took
with him everywhere he went

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,910
and he loved purple and pink.

34
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,430
I usually let him do
his thing at home,

35
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,190
but in public, I was worried
about judgment and teasing.

36
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,360
I didn’t know if I was doing
something wrong as Danny’s mom.

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,490
And I also kind of
wondered what Wilfredo

38
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,820
would have said or done.

39
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,240
I say to Danny, 
“How about Peter Pan instead?”

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,110
But Danny was really
clear on what he wanted.

41
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,560
I had to make a choice.

42
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,940
Would I try to pressure
him to be like other boys?

43
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:52,770
We found this big purple lacy
dress that had jewels on it

44
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,600
and I cut it down
to size for Danny

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,900
and I also found a
pink shimmery gown

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,480
because I decided I
could be a princess, too.

47
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,470
I had a dream that Wilfredo
came back to meet Danny.

48
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,650
I thought, oh no,
what if he sees

49
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,360
Danny in his princess dress?

50
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,030
And what if he doesn’t
accept him for who he is?

51
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,400
But I also believe in
something pretty fundamental.

52
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,850
Parents don’t get to decide
who their children are.

53
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,250
What we get to do
is to support them.

54
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,780
I do believe that
Wilfredo would have

55
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,900
seen that honoring Danny for
who he is was important to him.

56
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,350
Danny is really full
of love and heart —

57
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,032
something that he
got from his dad.

58
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:59,130
I would tell him, Danny
has not followed exactly

59
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,820
in your footsteps, but I can’t
imagine that you wouldn’t

60
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,610
be incredibly proud of our son.

61
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,290
He’s one of the bravest people
I’ve ever met, just like you.

62
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:25,285
My mother Nina —

63
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:29,235
I don't know a lot about her.

64
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:32,115
I remember that she was
profoundly sad.

65
00:04:32,115 --> 00:00:00,000
It was sad being around sadness.
