what's the difference between an NFL player who shows up for games and a player who stays home well one of them is making hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars per their contract and the other one is not only not making that money they are losing money by being fined and losing endorsements sorry I kind of set that up like it was a joke it definitely was not these players are jokes but that wasn't anyway I'm sure you heard about the NFL's announcement of their new policy no I did a video on it so go back on the archives for the rebel and check it out but they announced that their new policy would be that players on the field would be required to stand for the national anthem players have the option of staying in the locker room if they do not wish to be patriotic under our flag honor our country and basically show gratitude for the freedoms it affords and the men and women who protect us and give us those freedoms it's kind of unbelievable to me that anyone has the audacity to not do that but you know the world is full of idiots so in light of the NFL's new policy apparently some NFL players will be sitting out the games not just sitting in the locker room they actually won't be showing up to play so fan-freaking-tastic enjoy watching games from your couches you idiots by the way they can also be fined forty thousand dollars for missing camp and will obviously take a financial hit from companies who sponsor them all of which is perfectly fine with me for these entitled confused elites and here oh that's silly NFL they thought that their announcement last week would resolve the situation but activists and fake black guys Shaun King tweeted this on Sunday breaking several NFL stars have said that they will be considering sitting out next season and the de facto ban of Eric Reid and Colin Kaepernick is removed and both men are given spots back on rosters um whoever these players are is it really is this really this or do you want to die on first of all as I said last week the NFL is a private organization you can no more demand employment from them then I can demand that Dolce and Gabanna hire my five-foot-two self as a runway model so get off your high horse secondly if you want to sit out that's your prerogative but it will also be to your detriment sure they will miss you on the field but only for a hot second until one of literally thousands of other talented players waiting to play in the NFL get their shot and you better bet your sweet mammy that they will be happy to stand on the field and respect our anthem and flag so think really long and hard before you do this because you are fully replaceable literally everything about each and every one of you is replaceable but maybe a replacement won't be so ignorant hey an upgrade and we can finally get back to football everybody have a great day I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and opinions we have an unlimited supply of them here at the rebel so subscribe to our premium content at www.andyjenkins.com
