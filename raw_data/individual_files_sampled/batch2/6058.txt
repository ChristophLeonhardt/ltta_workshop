Donald Trump recently got himself into a mess about gold star families and whether he's written letters to them or call them and then he lashed out against President Obama and former presidents I have an update on that story for you guys and if it wasn't so disturbing it would be funny but before we were the update in case you didn't see there's the context of when it was first brought up they asked him about for service members who had died in Niger in an ambush by Isis and whether he'd reached out to them and why he is not talking about and this was his initial answer personal letters they've been sent or they're going out tonight but they were during the weekend I will at some point during the day period of time call the parents and the families because I have done that traditionally I have done it but they'll go out later but I'm but I will do it and I have done it as soon as I saw that clip if you guys saw that edition of The Young Turks I told you that's nonsense he hasn't done it if he had done it he would've just said I did it are you crazy I did it I did it really great I was a beautiful letters at beautiful calls that I had made to them it was obvious he hadn't done and I've got the fax on that for you in a second but let me show you one more where he equivocated traditional way if you look at president obama and other presidents most of them didn't make also a lot of them didn't make calls I like to call when it's appropriate when I think I'm able to do it they have made the ultimate sacrifice so generally I would say that I like to call I'm going to be calling them I want a little time to pass I'm going to be calling them I have as you know since I've been president I have I have and I will but I've sent the letters I've sent the letters and the calls what I can when I can when I'm not busy golfing okay so did he actually send the letters all right here comes the hilarious update from huff posts multiple families of military service members killed in the line of duty are now getting rush delivered letters from President Donald Trump days after Trump claimed he had called their media families of all service members who had been killed since office in January in other words for the billionth town row caught with his hand in the cookie jar going oh okay yeah yeah yeah of course I mean I'm rollin I already wrote him like I'm gonna write them and they're all right and of course he doesn't write any delay this is my best guess anyway he sends about in a panic more details the Atlantic Reporter Saturday that they're reporters has spoken to three gold star families who received condolence packages from the president this week hmm funny coincidence the Associated Press reporter had reached out to families of all 43 people who have been who have died in military services Trump became president but only made contact with about half the families some families told AP they were comforted by Trump's call while others hadn't heard from the president at all to a couple of specific instances here from the AP the family of armored Army sergeant Jonathan M hunter who died in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan in August was promised a call from the president but instead heard from vice president Mike Pence Britney Harris the widow of Army Specialist Christopher Michael Harris who also died in Afghanistan in August says she had not heard from the president either Associated Press identified at least two other gold star families who had wanted but did not receive a call from the president I've got yeah I get it I mean I'm kind of did it didn't do okay fine I'll send it now and he can't help himself nonetheless here he is doubling down that question and for the most part to best of my knowledge I think I've called every family of somebody that's died and it's the hardest call to make and I said it very loud and clear yesterday the hardest thing for me to do is do that now as far as other representatives I don't know I mean you could ask general Kelly did he get a call from Obama but I have called I believe everybody but certainly I'll use the word virtually everybody where during the last nine months something's happened to a soldier I've called virtually everybody I've gotten to Dover virtually everybody the guy has no bounds at all man you think we can't see the date on the letters you think that the reporters aren't gonna call the families and ask him hey did you get a caller did you not get a call did you get a letter or did you not get a letter he doesn't care about you if it's about him and his ego okay fine he'll do something if not he's not gonna do it and so he he only sent those letters in a rush because his hand again caught in the cookie jar if it wasn't god knows if he would have ever sent them TYT membership gets you commercial free young turks downloaded streaming podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent media TYT Network comm slash join
