1
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:12,321
>> Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND

2
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:14,490
WELCOME TO

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,191
"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT" ."

4
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:17,059
BRETT KAVANAUGH JUST FINISHED

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:17,760
SPEAKING WITH MARTHA MacCALLUM

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,764
AND HE PUSHED BACK AND DENIED

7
00:00:21,764 --> 00:00:24,734
COMPLETELY ALL OF THE ALEX

8
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:25,334
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM.

9
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:26,769
IN DOING THAT HE HAD TIMES

10
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,638
PROVIDED A LEVEL OF INFORMATION

11
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:29,338
ABOUT HIS PERSONAL LIFE THAT

12
00:00:29,338 --> 00:00:32,275
WOULD HAVE BEEN THINKABLE JUST

13
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:34,777
DAYS AGO.

14
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:35,912
>> Martha: THROUGH ALL THESE

15
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:39,782
YEARS IN QUESTION, YOU WERE A?

16
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:41,017
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

17
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:43,219
>> SO NEVER HAD INTERCOURSE WITH

18
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:44,253
ANYONE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND

19
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:44,954
COLLEGE SINCE WE ARE PROBING

20
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:48,024
INTO THAT?

21
00:00:48,024 --> 00:00:49,492
>> MANY YEARS AFTER, I WILL

22
00:00:49,492 --> 00:00:51,995
LEAVE IT AT THAT.

23
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:53,396
>> Tucker: NOT YOUR

24
00:00:53,396 --> 00:00:54,397
CONVENTIONAL INTERVIEW.

25
00:00:54,397 --> 00:00:55,665
HE WAS ASKED REPEATEDLY ABOUT

26
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:56,399
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM AND HIS

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,168
WIFE SAT BY HIM AS HE DENIED ALL

28
00:00:59,168 --> 00:00:59,836
OF THEM.

29
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:04,173
>> ARE NOT TO LET FALLS

30
00:01:04,173 --> 00:01:06,809
ACCUSATIONS DRIVE US OUT OF THIS

31
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:07,143
PROCESS.

32
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:10,680
WE ARE LOOKING FOR A FAIR

33
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,251
PROCESS WHERE YOU CAN HEAR MY

34
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:16,419
LIFELONG RECORD.

35
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:17,253
>> Tucker: NOBODY EXPECTED

36
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:19,222
ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHEN THAT

37
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:19,923
CONFIRMATION PROCESS STARTED.

38
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:23,893
WE WILL HAVE MORE FROM MARTHA'S

39
00:01:23,893 --> 00:01:25,762
INTERVIEW AND MARTHA WILL JOIN

40
00:01:25,762 --> 00:01:27,030
US ON THE SET LATER ON TO TELL

41
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,632
US WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THAT

42
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:29,999
ROOM.

43
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:32,202
BUT WE TYPICALLY OPEN THIS HOUR

44
00:01:32,202 --> 00:01:33,036
BY TALKING WITH SOMEONE THAT WE

45
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:33,470
DISAGREE WITH.

46
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,439
WE AGREE WITH STRAIGHTFORWARD

47
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,241
DEBATE ON THE SHOW.

48
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:39,075
AMERICANS HAVE BEEN TALKING TO

49
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,443
THEIR DIFFERENCES FOR MANY YEARS

50
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:42,412
AND IT'S WORKED PRETTY WELL.

51
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:44,981
WE FEEL THAT WE HAVE WISER

52
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:46,116
DECISIONS WHEN BOTH SIDES GET TO

53
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:46,583
HAVE THEIR SAY.

54
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,653
BUT TONIGHT, WE WILL PAUSE FOR A

55
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:49,986
MINUTE.

56
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:51,054
WE WILL INVITE GUESTS ON LATER

57
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:53,089
IN THE HOUR BUT FIRST THOUGH

58
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,391
IT'S WORTH IT TO CONSIDER

59
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:56,026
LEARNING WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM

60
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:57,594
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S CONSIDERATION

61
00:01:57,594 --> 00:01:58,461
FOR SUPREME COURT.

62
00:01:58,461 --> 00:01:59,262
IT FEELS LIKE A TURNING POINT,

63
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:02,699
SOMETHING NEW IN THIS COUNTRY.

64
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:06,469
WE CERTAINLY HAD CONTROVERSIAL

65
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:07,203
DEBATES.

66
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:09,271
ROBERT BORK, CLARENCE THOMAS AND

67
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:10,607
MANY OTHERS.

68
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:11,408
SHORTLY AFTER BEING ELECTED

69
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:13,810
PRESIDENT IN 1936,

70
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,578
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT TRIED TO TAKE

71
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:16,780
OVER THE ENTIRE JUDICIAL BRANCH

72
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,716
OF GOVERNMENT SO HE COULD IMPOSE

73
00:02:19,716 --> 00:02:22,219
HIS PROGRAM ON CONGRESS BY

74
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:22,619
FORCE.

75
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:25,422
THANKFULLY FDR FAILED IN THAT.

76
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:26,623
THE POINT IS, POLITICS HAS

77
00:02:26,623 --> 00:02:28,425
ALWAYS INTRUDED ON OUR JUSTICE

78
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:29,426
SYSTEM.

79
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:30,660
CONGRESS CONFIRMS THE NOMINEE IS

80
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,863
SO INHERENTLY POLITICAL.

81
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:34,631
YET SOME OF THIS WE HAVE NOT

82
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:35,832
SEEN BEFORE.

83
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:37,034
IT IS ENTIRELY NEW.

84
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:39,036
NEVER IN OUR LIFETIMES HAVE

85
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:40,604
SITTING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

86
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:43,206
ATTACKED OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AS

87
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:44,641
THEY NOW ARE.

88
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:45,842
LAWMAKERS HAVEN'T NOT MOCKED THE

89
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:48,779
IDEA OF DUE PROCESS WERE CALLED

90
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:50,414
FOR THE COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT OR

91
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:52,015
DECLARED TO THE BURDEN OF PROOF

92
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:53,517
IS ON THE ACCUSED RATHER THAN

93
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:55,052
THE ACCUSER.

94
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:56,420
ALL OF THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT

95
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,821
NOW IN WASHINGTON AND MORE.

96
00:02:57,821 --> 00:02:59,423
IT'S NOT JUST BRETT KAVANAUGH

97
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:00,991
UNDER ASSAULT, ELECTED OFFICIALS

98
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:02,226
HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY NO LONGER

99
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:04,428
BELIEVE IN OUR WESTERN

100
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:05,229
UNDERSTANDING OF JUSTICE.

101
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:07,598
IT IS NO PRESIDENT OF THAT HERE,

102
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:08,232
IT'S STUNNING.

103
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:09,433
YOU SHOULD PAY CLOSE ATTENTION

104
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:11,034
TO WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE IT

105
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:12,269
COULD AFFECT ALL OF US.

106
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,137
THIS SHIFT BEGAN LATE LAST WEEK

107
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:16,673
WITH THESE REMARKS FROM THE

108
00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:17,140
HAWAII SENATOR.

109
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,576
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THE MEN

110
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:21,178
OF THIS COUNTRY, SHUT UP AND

111
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:23,981
STEP UP, DO THE RIGHT THING FOR

112
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,215
A CHANGE.

113
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:27,151
NOT ONLY DO WOMEN LIKE DR. FORD

114
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:28,218
WHO BRAVELY COMES FORWARD NEED

115
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:33,457
TO BE HEARD, BUT THEY NEED TO BE

116
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:34,825
BELIEVED.

117
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:37,027
BE ONE SO THERE YOU HAVE IT, ALL

118
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:40,030
MEN ARE TO BELIEVED, NOT BECAUSE

119
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,031
THEY ARE PROVED GUILTY BUT

120
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:42,199
BECAUSE THEY ARE MEN AND THEY

121
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,602
ARE INHERENTLY GUILTY BY THEIR

122
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:44,969
NATURE.

123
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:46,770
ALL WOMEN ARE TO BE BELIEVE IT'S

124
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,609
BECAUSE THEY ARE FEMALE, AND ALL

125
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,277
THAT MATTERS IS DNA.

126
00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:54,278
ALL OF US ARE CONDEMNED OR

127
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:55,412
REDEEMED AT BIRTH AND THERE IS

128
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:57,214
NOTHING ANY OF US CAN DO TO

129
00:03:57,214 --> 00:03:59,083
CHANGE THAT, IT'S BAKED IN THE

130
00:03:59,083 --> 00:03:59,617
CAKE.

131
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:01,252
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

132
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:03,787
NO LIVING U.S. SENATOR HAS EVER

133
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:05,422
INSIDE ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN

134
00:04:05,422 --> 00:04:06,457
PUBLIC BUT NONE OF THOSE

135
00:04:06,457 --> 00:04:10,895
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES WERE

136
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:15,766
SPOILED OR WRONG.

137
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:17,735
SHE KEPT GOING AND HE OR SHE IS

138
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:20,370
FROM OVER THE WEEKEND.

139
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,139
>> DOESN'T KAVANAUGH HAVE THE

140
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,541
SAME PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AS

141
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,442
EVERYONE ELSE IN AMERICA?

142
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:26,544
>> I PUT HIS DENIAL IN THE

143
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:28,446
CONTEXT OF EVERYTHING THAT I

144
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:30,915
KNOW ABOUT HIM IN TERMS OF HOW

145
00:04:30,915 --> 00:04:32,950
HE PURCHASES CASES.

146
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,819
>> GIVE HER CREDIT FOR

147
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:35,219
DIRECTNESS.

148
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:37,755
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS NOT PROTECTED

149
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:38,622
BY THE UNITED STATES

150
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:39,056
CONSTITUTION.

151
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:41,625
HE DOES NOT ENJOY THE

152
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,259
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

153
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:44,995
KAVANAUGH IS GUILTY BECAUSE HIS

154
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:47,031
OPPONENTS SAY HE IS GUILTY AND

155
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:47,631
THAT IS HER POSITION.

156
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:49,433
SHE'S PROUD OF IT AND SHE HAS

157
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:51,068
BECOME A FOLK HERO ON THE LEFT

158
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:51,702
FOR SAYING THAT.

159
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:53,904
WATCH OR SAY IT AGAIN FROM

160
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:54,605
EARLIER TODAY.

161
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:56,907
>> CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT YOU

162
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:57,208
MEANT?

163
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,143
DO YOU BELIEVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH

164
00:04:59,143 --> 00:05:01,212
DESERVES PRESUMPTION OF

165
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:01,712
INNOCENCE, OR NOT?

166
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:03,681
>> WE ARE NOT IN A COURT OF LAW,

167
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:06,017
WE ARE ACTUALLY IN A COURT OF

168
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:07,218
CREDIBILITY AT THIS POINT AND

169
00:05:07,218 --> 00:05:09,220
WITHOUT HAVING THE FBI REPORT OR

170
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,222
SOME SEMBLANCE OF TRYING TO GET

171
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:11,956
CORROBORATION, WE ARE LEFT WITH

172
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:16,427
THE CREDIBILITY OF THE TWO

173
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:16,794
WITNESSES.

174
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:19,530
>> Tucker: OH, A COURT OF

175
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,266
CREDIBILITY.

176
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:23,501
SHE DIDN'T EXPLAIN WHAT THE

177
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:26,537
COURT OF CREDIBILITY IS, BUT YOU

178
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:27,838
CAN BE ASSURED THAT YOU NEVER

179
00:05:27,838 --> 00:05:29,840
WANT TO BE TRIED IN ONE.

180
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,175
IF THE BILL OF RIGHTS DOESN'T

181
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:32,276
APPLY TO BRETT KAVANAUGH, IT

182
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:33,611
PROBABLY DOESN'T APPLY TO YOU

183
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:33,945
EITHER.

184
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:37,415
IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT MAZIE

185
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:39,450
HIRONO THINKS OF YOUR POLITICAL

186
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,418
VIEWS.

187
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:42,720
KEEP IN MIND THAT ONCE YOU'VE

188
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,088
BEEN ACCUSED IN THIS NEW COURT

189
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:45,623
OF CREDIBILITY YOU ARE

190
00:05:45,623 --> 00:05:46,824
RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVING YOURSELF

191
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:47,825
INNOCENT.

192
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:49,427
IT'S YOUR JOB TO UNCONVICT

193
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:49,794
YOURSELF.

194
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,296
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A MIRROR IMAGE

195
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:53,298
OF OUR ACTUAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND

196
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:54,632
YOU ARE RIGHT, IT IS.

197
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:56,634
FOR MORE THAN A THOUSAND YEARS,

198
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:58,136
THE BURDEN OF PROOF HAS FALLEN

199
00:05:58,136 --> 00:06:00,238
ON THE ACCUSER WHICH IN OUR

200
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:00,838
COUNTRY AS A GOVERNMENT.

201
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:02,073
IF THEY SAY YOU DID IT, YOU HAVE

202
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:04,909
TO PROVE THAT YOU HAVE DONE IT.

203
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:10,682
HERE IS SENATOR BLUMENTHAL AND

204
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:12,417
EXPLAINING HOW THE NEW SYSTEM

205
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:12,717
WORKS.

206
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:14,219
>> WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY

207
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:16,688
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THESE

208
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:17,088
ALLEGATIONS.

209
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:19,424
THEY ARE SERIOUS AND CREDIBLE

210
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:20,692
AND IT NOW THE PERSON WITH THE

211
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:25,763
MOST KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEM,

212
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:28,032
NAMELY JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, AS

213
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:32,770
A RESPONSIBILITY, AS EVIDENCE TO

214
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,506
REVIVE THEM.

215
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:38,443
>> Tucker: YOUR JOB IS TO SHOW

216
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:38,943
YOU ARE INNOCENT.

217
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:40,411
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL WENT TO YALE

218
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:42,447
LAW SCHOOL, THAT HE LEARNED THAT

219
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:43,848
IN HIS CLASSES THERE?

220
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:46,551
IT'S A NEW IDEA BUT ALSO A VERY

221
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,220
OLD IDEA WHICH WAS COMMON FOR

222
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,088
THE ACCUSED HAD A RESPONSIBILITY

223
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:52,824
TO COME FORWARD TO ABOUT THE

224
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:54,592
CHARGES AGAINST THEM.

225
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:55,260
HERETICS WHO SURVIVE TORTURE

226
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,228
SOMETIMES GOT DECLARED INNOCENT,

227
00:06:57,228 --> 00:06:59,497
BUT THERE IS A FLIP SIDE TO THE

228
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:00,398
NEW SYSTEM.

229
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:02,400
BECAUSE THE ACCUSER GUILTY BY

230
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,835
DEFINITION, THE ACCUSER SUDDENLY

231
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:05,670
HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE

232
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,137
CREDIBLE CLAIMS.

233
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:08,973
WE ARE SEEING THAT PRINCIPLE IN

234
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:09,374
ACTION, TOO.

235
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:10,909
WE COVERED THE STORY ALL LAST

236
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:11,209
WEEK.

237
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:13,011
FIVE NIGHTS IN A ROW WE SAID WE

238
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:14,613
ARE GIVING CHRISTINE FORD EVERY

239
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:15,213
BENEFIT OF EVERY DOUBT.

240
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:17,415
AND WE DID THAT.

241
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:18,817
BUT LET'S BE HONEST NOW.

242
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:20,218
NOT MANY OF HER CLAIMS WOULD

243
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:22,087
HOLD UP IN AN ACTUAL COURT, THE

244
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:22,754
ONE GOVERNED BY THE JUSTICE

245
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:23,655
SYSTEM THAT WE THOUGHT WE HAD

246
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:27,626
UNTIL ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO WHEN

247
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:31,597
MAZIE HIRONO INFORMED US

248
00:07:31,597 --> 00:07:31,964
OTHERWISE.

249
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:33,232
WHEN DID THIS TAKE PLACE?

250
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:34,633
SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

251
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,201
WHERE ARE THE WITNESSES TO THIS?

252
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:38,804
THERE AREN'T ANY.

253
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:40,672
WHEN WAS THIS FIRST REPORTED TO

254
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:41,073
AUTHORITIES?

255
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:42,241
IT NEVER REALLY WAS.

256
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:44,209
THE STORY CAME OUT IN STAGES AND

257
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,645
IT WAS A RECOVERED MEMORY.

258
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:48,981
APPARENTLY SOMEONE BY A

259
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:50,015
PSYCHOTHERAPIST 30 YEARS AFTER

260
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,616
THE FACT.

261
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:54,019
AND THEN IT WAS UNDER SIX YEARS

262
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:54,620
BEFORE FORD NAMED BRETT

263
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,688
KAVANAUGH SPECIFICALLY WHEN HE

264
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:58,824
WAS BEING NOMINATED FOR THE

265
00:07:58,824 --> 00:07:59,591
SUPREME COURT.

266
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:01,827
THAT WAS THE POSITION AFFORDS A

267
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:03,529
LAWYER ALL OF WHOM WHO DOUBLED

268
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:05,597
AS THE DEMOCRATIC ACTIVISTS AND

269
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:07,166
OPERATIVES, AND SOME OF WHOM

270
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,301
IDENTIFIED BILL CLINTON FROM FAR

271
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:12,838
GRAVER ASSAULTS THAT HE WAS

272
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:13,839
ACCUSED OF.

273
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,508
LAST WEEK FOR EXAMPLE, FOR TOLD

274
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:18,710
SENATORS THAT SHE COULDN'T COME

275
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,312
TO WASHINGTON TO TESTIFY BECAUSE

276
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:21,980
SHE WAS AFRAID TO FLY ON

277
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,582
AIRPLANES.

278
00:08:23,582 --> 00:08:24,683
THIS FEAR IS A DIRECT RESULT OF

279
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:27,152
BEING GROPED OVER THE CLOSE BY

280
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:28,987
BRETT KAVANAUGH IN HIGH SCHOOL

281
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:30,923
IN THE 80s.

282
00:08:30,923 --> 00:08:32,991
AS ONE OF HER FRIENDS TOLD

283
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:33,725
"THE WASHINGTON POST," AIRPLANE

284
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:35,427
CABINS REMIND FORD OF THE

285
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:36,727
TRAUMA, THEY ARE AN ENCLOSED

286
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:38,831
SPACE WHERE YOU CAN'T GET AWAY.

287
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:39,832
BUT IS THIS TRUE?

288
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:41,833
FORD HAS RELATIVES ON THE

289
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,433
EAST COAST.

290
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,403
ACCORDING TO PUBLISHED ACCOUNTS,

291
00:08:44,403 --> 00:08:45,371
SHE'S BEEN HERE RECENTLY.

292
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:47,639
DID SHE DRIVE BACK AND FORTH

293
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,640
EVERY TIME SHE VISITED?

294
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,242
WE DON'T KNOW.

295
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:52,344
THEN "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

296
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:55,848
REPORTED THAT FORD DID GRADUATE

297
00:08:55,848 --> 00:09:01,487
WORK AND, IN IT THAT IS IN ORDER

298
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:05,424
TO DELAY THE PROCEEDINGS AND

299
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:06,825
THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT

300
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:07,893
COMMITTEE WOULD ASK HER IF SHE

301
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:09,028
SHOWED UP ON THURSDAY.

302
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:11,030
THEY PROBABLY WON'T ASK HER

303
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,431
THOUGH, THAT WOULD BE A VICTIM'S

304
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:12,765
SHAMING.

305
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:13,732
SHE'S A WOMAN AND SHE'S TELLING

306
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:15,901
THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT SHE

307
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:16,635
SAYS EVEN WHEN THINGS SHE SAYS

308
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:19,672
TURN OUT TO BE NOT TRUE, THEY

309
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:22,441
ARE STILL TRUE BY DEFINITION.

310
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:25,044
WATCH FORMER MICHIGAN

311
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:25,678
GOVERNOR JENNIFER GRANHOLM

312
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:26,445
EXPLAINED THIS PRINCIPLE.

313
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:29,682
>> KEVIN OUT JUDGE, SMITH AND

314
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:34,821
HER FRIEND, LELAND KAISER SAID

315
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,189
THEY DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING

316
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:39,225
LIKE THIS EVER HAPPENING.

317
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:39,992
AND LELAND KAISER SAID SHE

318
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:43,095
DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER BEING AT A

319
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:45,398
PARTY WHERE KAVANAUGH WAS

320
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:45,998
PRESENT.

321
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:46,699
>> THAT ACTUALLY CORROBORATES

322
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:48,568
FORD'S STORY THAT SHE WAS SO

323
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:52,405
HORRIFIED BY THIS, SHE KIND OF

324
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:53,840
SNUCK OUT OR SLUNK OUT OF THIS

325
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,041
APARTMENT IN A WAY THAT NO ONE

326
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,743
WOULD KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO COME

327
00:09:57,743 --> 00:09:59,879
BECAUSE SHE WAS SO UTTERLY

328
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,447
MORTIFIED.

329
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:02,114
>> Tucker: ARE YOU FOLLOWING

330
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:06,853
THIS AT HOME?

331
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:08,221
WHEN YOU ARE CORROBORATING

332
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:12,491
WITNESSES CAN'T CORROBORATE YOUR

333
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:15,027
STORY, AND THAT CAN BE

334
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:17,330
CORROBORATED MAY BE EVEN MORE S

335
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:17,597
SO.

336
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:19,999
CERTAINLY THE RULES WASHINGTON

337
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:22,435
WAS APPLYING TO THE NEW YORKER

338
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,470
MAGAZINE DROPPED LAST NIGHT AND

339
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,838
ONE OF CAVANAUGH'S CLASSMATES AT

340
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:29,308
YALE SAID, DURING A DRUNKEN

341
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:33,246
PARTY ON CAMPUS, KAVANAUGH

342
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:35,615
WAGGED HIS GENITALS IN HER FACE.

343
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:37,650
WHILE THAT SOUNDS AWFUL.

344
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,217
BUT IN THOSE INITIAL

345
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:43,423
CONVERSATIONS WITH NEW YORK, THE

346
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:45,058
CHARACTER WAS HESITANT TO

347
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:46,226
CONFIRM HIS ROLE.

348
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:47,627
AFTER SIX DAYS OF CONSULTING HER

349
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:50,196
MEMORIES AND HER ATTORNEY, SHE

350
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:52,499
FELT CONFIDENT ENOUGH OF HER

351
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:53,666
RECOLLECTIONS TO REMEMBER THAT

352
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,869
KAVANAUGH HAD EXPOSED HIMSELF AT

353
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:56,636
A DRUNKEN DORMITORY PARTY.

354
00:10:56,636 --> 00:10:58,638
SO IT TURNS OUT SHE DIDN'T

355
00:10:58,638 --> 00:10:59,706
ACTUALLY REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED.

356
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:01,207
NONE OF THE PEOPLE SHE SAID WERE

357
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,709
IN THE ROOM REMEMBER WHAT

358
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:03,643
HAPPENED EITHER.

359
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:06,346
YET AFTER TALKING TO HER LAWYER

360
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:07,480
FOR A WEEK SHE SUDDENLY

361
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,014
REMEMBERS IT.

362
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:10,050
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR CNN.

363
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,586
STRING THEM UP, GUILTY AS

364
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:14,020
CHARGED, STRING THEM UP.

365
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,256
>> IT CERTAINLY HAS A RING OF

366
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:16,823
TRUTH TO ME.

367
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:19,492
THE IDEA THAT IT IS ALL MADE UP

368
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:20,994
SEEMS PREPOSTEROUS AT THIS

369
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:21,294
POINT.

370
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:23,830
>> IT HAS A RING OF TRUTH,

371
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,164
PERFECT.

372
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:29,970
LET'S HANG HIM.

373
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:34,474
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT      ON BOTH

374
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:34,508
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT      ON BOTS

375
00:11:34,508 --> 00:11:34,541
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT      ON BOTD

376
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:28,502
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT      ON BOTS

377
00:11:28,502 --> 00:11:35,442
THAT'S A JOKE AT THIS POINT, AND

378
00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:35,675
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT      ON BOT,

379
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:37,511
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE

380
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:40,313
PLAYING ALONG.

381
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:43,116
NO MATTER HOW FRIVOLOUS ARE

382
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:44,351
OBVIOUSLY FRAUDULENT THEY ARE.

383
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:46,853
SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE THE ONES

384
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:49,489
WHO MADE THE COURT OF PUBLIC

385
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:50,490
CREDIBILITY POSSIBLE AT THIS

386
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,024
POINT.

387
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:53,593
HOW MANY MORE PIECES LIKE IT ARE

388
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:53,927
COMING?

389
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:56,229
AS MANY AS IT TAKES, NO QUESTION

390
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:56,830
ABOUT THAT.

391
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,865
WE CAN'T CONTROL THE SENATE

392
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:08,275
REPUBLICANS OBVIOUSLY, AND A MAN

393
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:10,811
WHO WAS LITERALLY MARRIED TO

394
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,045
GEORGE W. BUSH'S ASSISTANT CAN

395
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:12,913
CONFIRM THE SUPREME COURT THAT

396
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:14,381
NO REPUBLICAN CAN GET CONFIRMED

397
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:15,515
TO THE SUPREME COURT EVEN WITH

398
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:18,051
THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS, EVER.

399
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:19,252
BUT IT'S WORSE THAN THAT.

400
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:21,655
THERE IS A MIDTERM ELECTION JUST

401
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:23,257
WEEKS FROM NOW.

402
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:24,057
IF YOU ARE REPUBLICAN, HE MAY BE

403
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,893
WONDERING WHY SHOULD I BOTHER TO

404
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:26,193
VOTE?

405
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:29,062
YOU BACK TO TRUMP TO YEARS AGO

406
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:30,063
AND YOUR AND YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW

407
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:32,132
FROM BROOKLYN MOCK TO YOU, BUT

408
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:33,834
YOU DID IT ANYWAY.

409
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:37,537
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO SECURE

410
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:37,871
BORDERS.

411
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:39,439
HE WANTED AN END TO OBAMACARE

412
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,808
AND HE WANTED NONCRAZY PEOPLE ON

413
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:43,043
THE SUPREME COURT OF THE

414
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:43,477
UNITED STATES.

415
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:44,211
YOU DIDN'T GET THE FIRST TWO AND

416
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:47,648
YOU ARE STARTING TO REALIZE YOU

417
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:49,016
PROBABLY NEVER WILL GET THEM.

418
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:54,421
WE ARE ALL DISCOVERING IT ISN'T

419
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:57,224
EASY, WHY IS THAT?

420
00:12:57,224 --> 00:12:59,193
THE REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE DO

421
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:01,695
NOT CARE ABOUT YOU.

422
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:04,932
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO ABOUT PEOPLE

423
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:07,501
YOU CARE ABOUT.

424
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:10,437
IF THE REPUBLICANS CARE TO, THEY

425
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:11,438
WOULD PROTECT YOU.

426
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:12,873
THEY WOULD PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN

427
00:13:12,873 --> 00:13:13,807
FROM THE TORRENT OF MANDATORY

428
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:15,209
PROPAGANDA THEY FACE IN SCHOOLS

429
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:16,844
THAT ARE BANKRUPTING THEM.

430
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:18,445
THEY PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY AND

431
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:20,447
FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF

432
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:21,849
WORSHIP FROM THE TECH MONOPOLIES

433
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:23,317
THAT SEEM TO CRUSH ALL OF THOSE

434
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:24,852
THINGS AND THEY PROTECT BRETT

435
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:25,853
KAVANAUGH FROM THE OBVIOUS

436
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:28,155
SMEARS THAT ARE DESTROYING HIS

437
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:29,356
FAMILY IN HIS LIFE.

438
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:31,025
THEY WON'T PROTECT HIM AND THEY

439
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:33,027
WON'T PROTECT HIM FOR THE SAME

440
00:13:33,027 --> 00:13:35,029
REASONS THEY WON'T PROTECT YOU,

441
00:13:35,029 --> 00:00:00,000
AND IT'S HARD AND EMBARRASSING.
