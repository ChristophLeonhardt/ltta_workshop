from Andrew supreme great name what a good name Supreme Leader Clavin the wise at what point is it acceptable for fighting physical fighting to occur well I'm a great believer in that grown-ups shouldn't hit each other I am a great believer that grown-ups shouldn't hit each other and I actually I mean I I think I can think of times when I would have hit children but I didn't even hit my children no whole boy did they deserve it I got it I mean you know Mike a tall man yeah really but but I you know I think there's so much can be accomplished without doing that so I would only really want to do violence in self-defense I think that that is true mostly for war as well as just personal fisticuffs you know I think that most most of the arguments for war have to do with self-defense in other words even though it's happening overseas you think eventually it's going to come over here I think self-defense is a good place to start I can think of a couple of gray areas but you know I mean there I could see somebody in your face doing stuff that's so rotten that you have to slug him because you know he's gonna slug you first you know you might have to act first but basically I think you should not violence violence is extraordinary because it shuts down every other means of expression and shuts down any other means of finding a path to agreement it's an extraordinary act that really should only be taken in under an extraordinary turn
