MARCO RUBIO DID SOMETHING THAT
IS ARGUABLY BRAVE.
HE DECIDED HE WAS GOING TO
ATTEND A TOWN HALL WITH A
LOT OF THE SURVIVORS FROM THE
SHOOTING.
WHEN HE AGREED TO DO THAT I WAS
BORDERLINE SHOCKED BECAUSE
HE IS TAKING $3.3 MILLION FROM
THE NRA.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE DID IT OUT OF
ARROGANCE OR IF HE DID IT OUT OF
GOING INTO THE LIONS DEN?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS MOTIVATION
WAS.
OTHERS WERE THERE, THE SHERIFF
WAS THERE.
THE SHERIFF WAS IN FAVOR OF GUN
CONTROL.
CREDIT TO CNN FOR PUTTING IT
TOGETHER.
GOV.
BILL NELSON WAS THERE.
HE IS IN FAVOR OF GUN CONTROL.
AND DANA FROM THE NRA ñ THAT DID
NOT GO WELL.
BUT SENDER MARCO RUBIO IS
CORRUPT.
HE HAS TAKEN NRA MONEY.
IMPOLITE TELEVISION CIRCLES
THEY NEVER SAY THAT HIS
CORRUPTION ALTHOUGH THE REST OF
US KNOW IT IS.
THE PROBLEM HERE IS IT IS NOT
TELEVISION ANCHORS WHO ARE
TRAINED NOT TO ASK HARD
QUESTIONS.
IT IS ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO ARE
SURVIVORS OF THE SHOOTINGS.
SO THEY ARE GOING TO ASK
QUESTIONS.
I WANT TO GO TO THE STUDENT
MICHELLE.
SHE WANTED TO ASK ñ THIS GIVES
YOU A SENSE OF THE ANGER THEY
HAVE ABOUT THE NRA AND OVERALL
THE MONEY THAT IS MAKING THIS
CRISIS POSSIBLE AS IT FLOWS INTO
THE POLITICIANS AND THEY
REFUSED TO PASS GUN-CONTROL
LAWS.
LET'S WATCH.
I HAD A QUESTION FOR ñ FOR
HER AND THE NRA, AND ALL OF YOU
PUPPET POLITICIANS THAT THEY ARE
BACKING, WAS THE BLOOD OF MY
CLASSMATES AND MY TEACHERS WORTH
YOUR BLOOD MONEY?
SEN.
NELSON YOU DON'T ANSWER
THAT QUESTION.
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT
QUESTION.
EXCUSE ME?
THE REASON WHY IS NOT GREAT
TIMING IS THAT NELSON IS A
DEMOCRAT WHO IS IN FAVOR OF GUN
CONTROL.
THE STUDENT SAID IT WAS MAINLY
FOR DANA FROM THE NRA.
BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN GREAT IF
MARCO RUBIO WAS ASKED THE
QUESTION BECAUSE HE DOES TAKE
MONEY FROM THE NRA AND DOES
DO THEIR BIDDING.
DON'T WORRY ANOTHER STUDENT
STEPPED UP AND ASKED THE
SAME THING MORE POLITELY BUT
VERY MUCH TO THE POINT.
SEN.
RUBIO, KENNY TO ME RIGHT
NOW THAT YOU WILL NOT ACCEPT A
SINGLE DONATION FROM THE NRA?
I WISH I COULD'VE SPOKEN THE
NRA LADY A QUESTION.
I WOULD ASK HER HOW SHE CAN LOOK
IN THE MIRROR CONSIDERING
THE FACT THAT SHE HAS CHILDREN,
BUT MAYBE SHE AVOIDS THOSE.
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T FREAKING KNOW.
I
LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE REAL PEOPLE
GET IN A ROOM WITH POLITICIANS.
THE ANCHORS NEVER ASK ABOUT THE
MONEY.
PEOPLE IN TELEVISION NEVER ASK
HEY, IS IT A COINCIDENCE THAT
YOU TOOK MONEY FROM THE NRA AND
VOTED ON THEIR BEHALF.
IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE THE
REST OF US KNOW IT IS NOT A
COINCIDENCE.
FROM THE MOUTHS OF BABES, TAKES
A STUDENT WHO SUFFERED THIS
TRAGEDY TO ASK THE MOST OBVIOUS
QUESTION IN THE WORLD.
LET'S SEE HOW MARCO RUBIO TRIES
TO WIGGLE OUT OF IT.
NUMBER ONE, THE POSITIONS I
HOLD ON THESE ISSUES I HAVE
HELD SINCE THE DAY ENTERED
OFFICE IN THE CITY OF WEST
MIAMI AS AN OFFICIAL.
NUMBER TWO.
THE ANSWER IS PEOPLE BUY INTO MY
AGENDA.
AND I DO SUPPORT THE SECOND
AMENDMENT AND I ALSO
SUPPORT THE RIGHT OF YOU AND
EVERYONE HERE TO BE ABLE TO
GO TO SCHOOL AND BE SAFE.
AND I DO SUPPORT ANY LAW THAT
WOULD KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE
HANDS OF A DERANGED KILLER, AND
THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT THE
THINGS THAT I HAVE STOOD FOR
INFO FOR DURING THAT TIME.
MORE NRA MONEY?
THAT
IS THE WRONG WAY TO LOOK ñ
THE ANSWER IS PEOPLE BUY INTO MY
AGENDA.
LISTEN, YOU CAN ASK THAT
QUESTION AND I CAN TELL YOU
THAT PEOPLE BUY INTO MY AGENDA.
I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU
GUYS HAVE ABOUT ñ
IN THE NAME OF 17 PEOPLE, YOU
CANNOT ASK THE NRA TO GET
THEIR MONEY OUT OF YOUR
CAMPAIGN?
I THINK IN THE NAME OF 17
PEOPLE I CAN PLEDGED TO YOU THAT
I WILL SUPPORT ANY LAW THAT WILL
PREVENT IT KILLER LIKE THIS FROM
GETTING THEIR HANDS ON ONE.
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO ASK A
QUESTION AND I AM HERE TO TELL
YOU ñ
I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED ANYONE
WHO AGREES WITH MY AGENDA.
LET'S BREAK THAT DOWN.
NUMBER ONE HE SAYS THEY JUST
HAPPEN TO FIND ME AND THEY
SUPPORTED MY AGENDA.
THERE IS A TINY BIT OF TRUTH AND
THAT.
IF YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO WAS
GOING TO SUPPORT EVERYTHING A
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION WANTS
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND THAT
PERSON AND THEN GIVE THEM
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS UNTIL
THEY WIN ELECTIONS.
AND YOU SWAP OUT THE GUY THAT
DOESN'T HAVE THE CORPORATE
MONEY AND YOU PUT HIM IN OFFICE.
IF YOU WANT A GUY LIKE MARCO
RUBIO WHO SAYS NO MATTER HOW
MANY MASSACRES HAPPEN ON MY
CITIZENS AND THEIR KIDS, I WILL
ALWAYS SUPPORT THE NRA AND THEIR
POSITION TO BUY WEAPONS.
THEN THE NRA WILL FIND YOU AND
GIVE YOU MILLIONS YOU CAN
WIN EVERY ELECTION.
IS MARCO RUBIO AWARE THAT HE
TOOK OVER $3 MILLION TO THE NRA?
MIGHT THAT AFFECT HIS VOTE?
OF
COURSE.
IS PREPOSTEROUS TO SAY
OTHERWISE.
I ASKED SEN.
JOE FROM WEST
VIRGINIA ABOUT ONE OF HIS TOP
DONORS.
THEY ARE POLLUTERS OF STREAMS
AND HE SPECIFICALLY VOTED
TO DEREGULATE POLLUTING STREAMS.
SO UNDER THE MARCO RUBIO
POLITICAL SPEECH SEN.
MANSION
WOULD SAY I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FOR
POLLUTING STREAMS.
JUST SO HAPPENS THAT A COMPANY
THAT POLLUTES STREAMS
HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY DONORS.
YES BY THE WAY THE NRA IS IN
FAVOR OF SELLING GUNS TO
THE MENTALLY ILL.
THEY HAVE ACTUALLY ASKED THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO ALLOW
FOR MORE MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE TO
HAVE GUNS AND THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION DID DO THEIR
BIDDING.
LET'S SAY HE WAS A TRULY
PRINCIPLED MAN.
HE COULD SAY YES TO THAT YOUNG
STUDENT THERE.
I WILL STILL VOTE WITH THE NRA
TO TAKE THEIR MONEY.
IN FACT A PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE
IN CALIFORNIA RUNNING
AGAINST DIANE FEINSTEIN SAYS SHE
TAKES NO PACK MONEY.
IF I VOTE THE UNIONS I DON'T
WANT ANYONE THINKING I AM
DOING IT FOR THE MONEY.
BUT MARCO RUBIO UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES AND 17 PEOPLE THAT
ARE HIS CITIZENS IN FLORIDA
DEAD, THERE IS NO WAY I WILL
KEEP THAT MONEY AND KEEP ON
TAKING THAT MONEY.
ONE MORE THING.
THAT IS NOT TRUE.
THEY FIND A WAY TO GET THE 
GUN
IN AMERICA BECAUSE WE HAVE
NO GUN-CONTROL.
LET ME SHOW YOU STATS AND I WILL
KEEP ON SHOWING YOU UNTIL HE
GETS THROUGH PEOPLE'S HEADS.
CONDUCT TOTALS IN AMERICA IN AN
AVERAGE YEAR IS THIS.
UNREAL.
I WILL SHOW YOU JAPAN'S NUMBERS
IN A SECOND FOR CONTEXT.
I KEEP ON SHOWING YOU THIS
BECAUSE IT IS ñ
THE COUNTRIES ON THE LOWER
LEFT, LOW AMOUNT OF GUNS, LOW
AMOUNT OF MASS SHOOTERS.
THE US ON THE RIGHT QUARTER.
THERE ARE JUST AS MANY PEOPLE
FOR PER CAPITA THAT ARE MENTALLY
ILL IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES.
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO
WEAPONS SO THERE ARE NOT AS
MANY MASS SHOOTINGS.
THAT BRINGS ME 
TO JAPAN.
IS IT BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS
PERFECT MENTAL HEALTH IN JAPAN
AND THERE ARE NO CRIMINALS?
NO.
IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET
GUNS.
IT IS NOT THAT COMPLICATED.
ONE MORE PIECE OF CONTEXT.
MORE GUNS EQUAL MORE GUN DEATHS.
EVERY LIE THAT COMES OUT OF
MARCO RUBIO'S MOUTH IS PAID
FOR BY THE NRA.
THEY KNOW THESE STATS AND THEY
NEVER TALK ABOUT THESE STATS
BECAUSE THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO
ADMIT I AM DOING IT FOR THE
MONEY.
I WAS GOING TO SAY I SURE HOPE
THAT BLOOD MONEY IS WORTH IT.
BUT NO MATTER OF MONEY IS WORTH
THAT.
THESE POLITICIANS ARE TRULY
CRAZY.
