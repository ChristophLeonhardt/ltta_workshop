GREG: SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT TAKE

2
00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:08,378
THE BROOM TO LEG ROOM?

3
00:00:08,378 --> 00:00:10,747
THE HOUSE PASSED A 2,000 PAGE

4
00:00:10,747 --> 00:00:12,082
BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE FAA

5
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:13,984
TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THE WAY

6
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:17,587
WE FLY, INCLUDING MINIMUM

7
00:00:17,587 --> 00:00:20,223
REQUIREMENTS FOR SEAT SIZES AND

8
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:20,991
LEG ROOM.

9
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:22,526
TYRUS, BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT,

10
00:00:22,526 --> 00:00:24,061
AIRLINE SEATS ARE GETTING

11
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:26,663
TIGHTER THAN BIKE SHORTS ON A

12
00:00:26,663 --> 00:00:26,997
HIPPO.

13
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:27,664

15
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,101
PUTTING THEM ON BUT I LOVE

16
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:33,804
WATCHING HIM TAKE THEM OFF.

17
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:35,105
ENOUGH WITH THE HIPPO STUFF.

18
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:36,406
LEG ROOM IS SHRINKING.

19
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:37,541
EVEN I HAVE NOTICED.

20
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,811
AND I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH LEG.

21
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:41,178

22
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:43,280
GREG: NOW, I KNOW WE'RE A VERY

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,615
DIVIDED NATION, BUT WE CAN ALL

24
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:47,017
AGREE FLYING SUCKS.

25
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:48,018
BUT SHOULD GOVERNMENT BE IN

26
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:49,553
CHARGE OF THIS?

27
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:51,488
IF THEY THINK THEY CAN HANDLE

28
00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:54,524
LEG ROOM, WHY NOT THE BOARDING

29
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:56,426
PROCESS OR THE SUPER TINY

30
00:00:56,426 --> 00:00:56,793
BATHROOMS.

31
00:00:56,793 --> 00:01:01,398
I CAN'T EVEN READ IN THERE.

33
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:04,200
GREG: TRY TO READ THE "WALL

34
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,501
STREET JOURNAL" OR TRY IT LIKE

35
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:06,570
THAT, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

37
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:08,505
GREG: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FOOD.

38
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:10,374
HERE'S A VIDEO I TOOK OF MY

00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:22,252
MY EGGS.

41
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:23,920
OH MAN I BURNED MY MOUTH ON

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,221
THAT.

43
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:24,588
ALL RIGHT.

44
00:01:24,588 --> 00:01:26,290
I HAVE TO GO TO YOU TYRUS FOR NO

45
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,393
APPARENT REASON.

46
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:32,863
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY.

47
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:33,397
SIZIST PIG.

48
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:33,764
[LAUGHTER]

49
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:34,832
>> GREG HAS A HARD TIME FITTING

50
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:36,934
IN THE BATHROOM AT THE AIRPORT,

51
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:39,770
DOES ANYBODY REALLY FEEL SORRY

52
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,038
FOR HIM?

53
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:43,307
LISTEN, THIS IS A SERIOUS THING.

54
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:44,374
GREG: DO YOU WANT GOVERNMENT

55
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:44,808
INTERVENTION?

56
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:46,143
>> BE QUIET BECAUSE THIS IS

57
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:46,476
SERIOUS.

58
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:47,277
IF THIS WAS AN ISSUE ABOUT

59
00:01:47,277 --> 00:01:48,779
HAVING A LITTLE THING TO HELP

60
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:50,414
YOU SIT WITH YOUR FEET ON THE

61
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:53,016
TOILET, I WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT

62
00:01:53,016 --> 00:01:53,550
YOU.

63
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,319
I WOULD BE QUIET AND RESPECTFUL

64
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,487
TO YOUR PLIGHT IF YOUR FEET

65
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:57,554
DON'T TOUCH THE GROUND WHEN YOU

66
00:01:57,554 --> 00:01:58,322
USE THE BATHROOM.

67
00:01:58,322 --> 00:02:00,224
I GET IT.

I HAVE ACTUAL FOOTAGE OF ME

73
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:11,301
SUFFERING IN AN AIRPLANE.

74
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:12,803
I KNOW IT WOULD TAKE TWO OF YOUR

75
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:14,338
FEET TO BE ONE IN ONE OF MY

76
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:14,872
SHOES.

77
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:16,140
LOOK AT THAT.

78
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,541
BY THE WAY, THE PERSON WHO TOOK

79
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,676
THAT PICTURE WAS NONE OTHER THAN

80
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:20,477
GREG GUTFELD.

81
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:23,213
NO PRIVACY.

82
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:24,481
SOMEONE'S LIKE FOX DOESN'T FLY

83
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:26,383
YOU FIRST CLASS?

84
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:30,387
THAT IS FIRST CLASS.

TO THE SIDE TO SLEEP.

88
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:34,558
IT IS BRUTAL.

89
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:36,193
SO NORMALLY LIKE MY LIBERTARIAN

90
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:37,595
FRIEND KAT OVER HERE, I DON'T

91
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,063
LIKE GOVERNMENT OR NOTHING, BUT

92
00:02:39,063 --> 00:02:41,999
IF UNCLE SAM HAS GOT TO GET IN

93
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,500
TO GET OUT OF THE JAM, I'M WITH

94
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,502

00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:55,046
THAT'S -- KAT, AS YOU KNOW, I

99
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:56,080
HATE BIG GOVERNMENT UNLESS THEY

100
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,848
DO THINGS THAT I LIKE.

101
00:02:57,848 --> 00:02:58,449
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?

102
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:01,118
>> I'M NOT A HYPOCRITE.

103
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:03,054
I THINK THAT IF AN AIRLINE

104
00:03:03,054 --> 00:03:04,889
WANTED TO EXIST WHERE THEY JUST

105
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:05,656
LIKE STACK PEOPLE ON EACH

106
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:08,392
OTHER'S LAPS AND IT WAS CHEAPER,

107
00:03:08,392 --> 00:03:10,094
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT

108
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:10,494
ALTERNATIVE.

109
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:11,629
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

110
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:12,496
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

111
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:13,598
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO

112
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,566
FLY PEOPLE IN PLANES WITHOUT

113
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:18,102
SEATS WHERE YOU JUST MEANDER

114
00:03:18,102 --> 00:03:19,337
ABOUT AND VAPE.

115
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:21,005
I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE

116
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:22,139
ALLOWED.

117
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:22,506

122
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:29,080
I'M A GROWN WOMAN.

123
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,183
I CAN HANDLE MY OWN TURBULENCE

124
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:33,451

00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:42,693
I ALWAYS HAVE TO WEAR SOCKS

132
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:43,828
UNDER MY SANDALS.

133
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:44,462

OWE JUST WEAR TENNIS SHOES?

136
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:49,300
WELL, BECAUSE THEN I HAVE TO

00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,269
UNTIE THEM AND TAKE THEM OFF

138
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,538
BECAUSE OF, YOU KNOW, THE TSA

139
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:54,505
INFRINGING UPON MY RIGHTS EVERY

GREG: CHARLIE, IT SCARES ME THAT

170
00:04:40,352 --> 00:04:41,520
REGULATIONS DO MORE HARM THAN

171
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,459
GOOD, LIKE, THERE'S A LIMIT FOR

172
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,493
STEWARDESSES FOR TEN HOUR

173
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:48,894
SHIFTS.

174
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:50,762
THAT MEANS IF YOU ARE ON THE TAR

175

MAC AND ABOUT TO TAKE OFF, LET'S

176
00:04:52,797 --> 00:04:57,202
SAY IT IS DELAYED 45 MINUTES, IT

177
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:58,270
IS PAST THEIR SHIFT, THEY COULD

178
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,970
TURN AROUND AND DUMP YOU.

179

I DESPISE ALL AIRLINES.

181
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:03,208
I WOULD MAKE A 12 HOUR DRIVE

182

EASY TO AVOID HAVING TO GET INTO

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,577
AN AIRPLANE.

184
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:07,712

00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:16,087
GOVERNMENT.

192
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:16,521
GREG: YEAH.

193
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:19,324
>> BUT EVERYBODY COMPLAINS ABOUT

194
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:19,691
TSA.

195
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:21,259
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO LIKES TO

196
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,827
GO THROUGH TSA?

197
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:24,763
>> YES, YOU ARE.

198
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:25,730
GREG: I DON'T MIND IT.

199
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,831
SOME AIRPORTS THEY ARE

200
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:27,198
FANTASTIC.

201
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:28,266
AND OTHER ONES THEY ARE JUST

202
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:29,467
ANGRY, BUT MOST OF THE GUYS ARE

203
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:30,969
PRETTY GOOD AND THEY ARE FANS OF

204
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:31,770
THIS SHOW.

205
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:39,544
REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU START --

206
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:39,911
[APPLAUSE]

207
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:40,679
GREG: SOMETIMES THEY WILL PUT

208
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:42,414
THINGS IN MY POCKETS.

209
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:42,781
[LAUGHTER]

210
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:43,382
GREG: ALL RIGHT.

211
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:45,150
MADISON, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

212
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,450
THIS?

213
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,885
>> ALL ABOUT EXTRA ROOM, BUT I

214
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:48,019
DON'T WANT THE REGULATION.

215
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:48,453
GREG: YEAH.

216
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:53,592
>> CAPITALISM WORKS.

217
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:55,627
IF THE PLANES HAVE SEATS THAT

218
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:56,795
ARE TOO SMALL, PEOPLE WON'T FLY

219
00:05:56,795 --> 00:05:57,996
THOSE AIRLINES ANYMORE.

220
00:05:57,996 --> 00:06:01,299
IT WILL WORK ITSELF OUT.

221
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:02,434
LET ME SAY ONE THING, THE

222
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:03,034
AIRLINES ARE TERRIBLE.

223
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:04,703
IT DOESN'T GOING TO MAKE THEM

224
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:06,037
BETTER EVEN IF I'M SITTING IN A

225
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:08,273
SEAT THAT'S BIGGER, I'M GETTING

226
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:10,175
WATER DRIPPED ON MY HEAD HALF

227
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,576
THE TIME.

228
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,010
GREG: THE WATER THING -- I

229
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,112
NOTIFIED THEM THAT THERE WAS

230
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:16,482
WATER DRIPPING, AND THEY GO OH

231
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:16,982
YEAH.

232
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:17,816
[LAUGHTER]

233
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:19,184
>> I SAT DOWN --

234
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:19,751
GREG: CONDENSATION.

235
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:22,121
BY THE WAY, HERE'S MY THEORY ON

236
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:23,355
WHY PEOPLE ARE SO HOSTILE WHEN

237
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:23,856
THEY FLY.

238
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:27,025
DID ANYBODY EVER SEE THE MOVIE

239
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:27,459
SNOW PIERCER?

240
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,595
>> NO.

241
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:31,563
GREG: SO WE'RE DEVELOPING A

242
00:06:31,563 --> 00:06:33,132
CLASS SYSTEM WHERE DEPENDING ON

243
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:34,800
HOW MUCH YOU PAY IT'S HOW MUCH

244
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,367
COMFORT YOU GET.

245
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:38,237
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE

246
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:39,471
AIRLINES.

247
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:41,206
IT IS JUST LIKE SNOW PIERCER

248
00:06:41,206 --> 00:00:00,000
WHICH WAS A SEGMENTED CAPSULE
