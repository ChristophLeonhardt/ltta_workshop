IT PROBABLY DIDN'T HELP, BUT NOBODY WAKES UP IN THE CAMPAIGN WORLD HOPING THEY'LL GET A TWEET AGAINST THEM FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, BUT I THINK IT BEGS THE LARGER DYNAMICS PLAYED OUT IN THE RACE, ARE YOU FOR TRUMP OR NOT? WELL, IT WASN'T QUITE THAT SIMPLE. MARK SANFORD DID LOSE ON AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DID TWEET AGAINST HIM. IT WASN'T CLOSE, HE LOST FAIRLY CLEARLY TO KATIE ARRINGTON WHO JOINS US OUT OF CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL NOMINEE FOR THAT DISTRICT. MS. ARRINGTON, WELCOME TO YOU. CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH, SIR. AN HONOR TO BE ON THE SHOW TODAY. NEIL: WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING, THAT ESSENTIALLY DONALD TRUMP LOST HIM THIS? YOU KNOW, AND WE ALL IN SOUTH CAROLINA THANK MARK SANFORD FOR THE PAST 24 YEARS OF IS SERVICE, IT'S ENOUGH. THIS IS NOT J US ABOUT THE TRUMP FACTOR. IT'S ABOUT A HARD-WORKING CAMPAIGN AND HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE FACT SAYING NO CONTINUOUSLY DOESN'T SOLVE PROBLEMS, THAT WE NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY IN WASHINGTON WHO IS GOING TO GET TO WORK TO GET THE PROBLEMS FIXED IN THIS NATION AND IT'S DISHEARTENING TO SEE HIM CONTINUE ON FOR THIS. TRUMP HAS GONE SO FAR IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, IT'S ENOUGH, STOP NOW. IT'S OKAY. MOVE ON, WE'VE GOT BIGGER ISSUES. NEIL: WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT IT, IS 90% OF THE TIME OR SO, HE WAS ALIGNED WITH THE PRESIDENT. AND I GUESS BECAUSE HE MADE A DUSTUP ON AMONG OTHER ISSUES, THE TRADE THING, THAT GOT THE NOW, THERE MIGHT BE OTHER FACTORS, I WOULD IMAGINE THERE WERE, BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE SERIOUS ISSUES WITH THE PRESIDENT'S TARIFFS, POLICY AND HOW THAT COULD BOOMERRANG. ARE YOU AFRAID IF YOU'RE ELECTED TOWING THE TRUMP LINE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TRUMP LINE. MARK SANFORD WENT ON CNN HOW MANY TIMES TO BASH THE PRESIDENT AND HE MADE IT PERSONAL. HE WAS VERY PERSONAL ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND ONE OF THE FEW REPUBLICANS TO GET UP AND BRING UP THE STORMY DANIELS STORY. AND BLAMED THE PRESIDENT FOR STEVE SCALISE'S SHOOTING SAYING HE WAS CULPABLE. YOU CAN'T AGREE WITH EVERYONE, THIS NATION IS FOUNDED ON DEBATE AND CONVERSATION, BUT THE PROBLEM WITH MARK SANFORD, HE CAN'T GET INTO A SEAT AT THE TABLE WITH THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE'S BEEN SO OFFENSIVE. IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT POLICY, IT'S ANOTHER THING TO GO PERSONALLY ATTACKING SOMEONE ON NATIONAL TV TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND THAT. THE TARIFF ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW, I WOULD HOPE THAT I COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT, BUT, YOU KNOW, AS A NATION, I THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF TAKE A STEP AND THINK, THIS IS THE WORLD'S BEST NEGOTIATOR. ALL THE THINGS THAT EVERYONE HAS BEEN CATEGORICALLY TERRIFIED OF, NORTH KOREA, HE'S GOING TO BRING US TO NUCLEAR WAR. HE'S MANAGED TO BRING US THIS, AND I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, BUT WHEN I GET TO WASHINGTON I'D LIKE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION, A RESPECTFUL DISCUSSION WITH THE PRESIDENT. NEIL: DO YOU AGREE WITH HIS APPROACH ON TRADE? RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, I COME FROM A COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS HELP WITH ITS STEEL AND ALUMINUM, SO, YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO LOOK OUT FOR THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. WE HAD A BRIDGE ACTUALLY MALFUNCTION HERE, A BRIDGE BREAK, THE CABLE SNAPPED AND THANKFULLY WE HAD A COMPANY RIGHT HERE, STANDARD TECH MANUFACTURING IN SUMMERVILLE THAT WAS ABLE TO FIX IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE STEEL ON SITE. SO, I ABSOLUTELY AM GOING TO BE ABOUT SOUTH CAROLINA FIRST, BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS A GLOBAL VIEW. I THINK THAT I WOULD NEED TO SPEAK WITH HIM BEFORE I MADE ANY DECISIONS ON THAT. NEIL: NOW, IN THE RACE IN THE FALL AND THINGS HAVE CHANGED AND PROSPECTS HAVE IMPROVED FOR A LOT OF REPUBLICANS, PERHAPS YOURSELF INCLUDED, GIVEN THE PICKUP IN THE ECONOMY AND CERTAINLY PICKUP IN SOUTH CAROLINA ECONOMY PARTICULARLY IN YOUR VERY DISTRICT AND I'M WONDERING IF THAT FADES OFF, IN, YOU KNOW, SORT OF BLUE WAVE THAT EVERYONE WAS PREDICTING OR THERE WAS STILL ENOUGH FRUSTRATION WITH THE PRESIDENT PERSONALLY THAT IT WIPES OUT ALL OF THOSE ADVANTAGES? WHAT DO YOU THINK? WELL, I CAN SAY THE BLUE WAVE IS NOT GOING TO WASH ON THE SHORES OF SOUTH CAROLINA. OUR ECONOMY IS ROBUST. WE HAVE MORE JOBS TO FILL THAN WE HAVE PEOPLE TO FILL THEM, AND ULTIMATELY, THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THE VOTING BOOTH AND DECIDING AND MAKING THEIR VOICE HEARD ON. OUR NATION HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER. RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. WE HAVE A BOOMING ECONOMY AND AS FAR AS GLOBAL PEACE, WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE, YOU KNOW, WORLD WAR II. LET'S TAKE A MINUTE AND THINK ABOUT THE GOODNESS THAT'S COMING OUT OF THIS AND I THINK THAT SOUTH CAROLINA WAS VERY VOCAL IN THAT, IN THIS LAST PRIMARY SEASON AND I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE INTO NOVEMBER. NEIL: DO YOU WANT THE PRESIDENT TO CAMPAIGN FOR YOU AS HE INDICATED HE WILL? RIGHT NOW I AM JUST GOING ON THE HARD WORK OF THIS CAMPAIGN. I APPRECIATE THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET THE DAY OF. IT WAS 4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON. A LOT OF THE VOTERS HAD ALREADY GONE TO THE POLLS, BUT THIS CAMPAIGN, YOU KNOW, TO MARK SANFORD, SIR, THIS WAS A HARD-FOUGHT, HARD-WON CAMPAIGN. WE KNOCKED ON THOUSANDS OF DOORS, WE YOU KNOW, MY CAMPAIGN PLEDGES, I'M DONATING $125,000 OF SALARY BACK EVERY YEAR AND TERM LIMITINGS MYSELF AND DENYING THE CONGRESSIONAL RETIREMENT BENEFITS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT EDGED OUT MARK IN THIS BECAUSE WE'RE TIRED OF CAREER POLITICIANS GOING TO WASHINGTON AND NOT GETTING THE PEOPLE'S WORK DONE, CITIZEN LEGISLATORS. THAT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION WAS ABOUT. THIS IS A PERSON, I'VE WORKED A HARD LIFE AND STARTED AT THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT AT DENNY'S ALL THE WAY TO THE BRIEFING ROOMS AT THE PENTAGON AND IT WAS HARD WORK AND PERSEVERANCE OF ME AND OTHER VOLUNTEERS THAT WE WON THIS ELECTION. NEIL: AND YOU WON. KATIE ARRINGTON, AN INTERESTING RACE TO WATCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEIL: WE DID CALL
