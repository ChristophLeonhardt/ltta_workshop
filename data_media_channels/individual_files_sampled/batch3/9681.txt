NEGATIVE REACTION. TARIFFS IN JULY. Bret: KEVIN CORKE OF THE POLITICS AND THE OTHER STORIES OF THE DAY. BRIT HUME IS HERE TONIGHT. JUST BEFORE WE CAME OUT HERE, THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ABOUT THE STORY. SURPRISED THAT HARLEY-DAVIDSON I FOUGHT HARD FOR THEM AND ULTIMATELY THEY WILL NOT PAY TARIFFS SELLING INTO THE E.U., WHICH HAS FOR US BADLY ON TRADE. THOUGHTS ON THAT? I WOULD INTERPRET "BE PATIENT," JUST LET THIS GO FOR A WHILE HARLEY-DAVIDSON, DON'T DO ANYTHING. I THINK WE WILL GET A DEAL OUT OF THAT AND EVERYONE WILL BE AND IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY CLEAR WHAT NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDERWAY. SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT'S DESIRE TO TAMP THIS DOWN BECAUSE IT IS AN EMBARRASSING RESULT. Bret: BUT ON THE BIG PICTURE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS DOES IT PAY OFF DOWN THE ROAD? THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT HAS BEDEVILED TRADING NATIONS FOR AS LONG AS THERE HAS BEEN SUCH THINGS. NATIONS ENGAGED IN AN UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICE. TARIFFS THEMSELVES COULD BE UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICE. THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR ECONOMIES AND THEIR DISADVANTAGES OF OTHERS, AND IT'S NOT FAIR. WE HAVE A SET OF RULES TO BE IT TAKES TOO LONG AND IT'S TOO BUREAUCRATIC. THAT LEAVES YOU WITH WHAT OTHER WEAPON IN HAND? TARIFFS. SO IN A SENSE, YOU END UP FIGHTING TRADE PRACTICES WITH TARIFFS. NOW TARIFFS CAN BE EFFECTIVE AND AND IF YOU TRIGGER A TRADE WAR IN WHICH YOU GO TIT FOR TAT, TIT FOR TAT, PRETTY SOON YOU HAVE A BIGGER THAN THE NATION SITUATION GOING ON LIKE WE HAD DURING THE DEPRESSION AND EVERYBODY LOSES. THAT'S THE DANGER, THE PRESIDENT MAKE IT DEALS OUT OF THIS AND IT MAY WORK BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, IS PLAYING WITH FIRE. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE STABILITY STORY. YOU HEARD CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE WATERS WALKING BACK YOUR AND GET IN THEIR FACE AFTER THE SARAH SANDERS INCIDENT OVER THE PLAY WELL WITH THE PUBLIC AT LARGE NO MATTER YOUR POLITICAL AFFILIATION. BUT IT DOES EXEMPLIFY THE EXTREMES TO WHICH PEOPLE ARE GOING AND THE EXTREMES TO WHICH PEOPLE ARE FEELING IN REACTION TO THIS PRESIDENT. I'M NOT SAYING IT IS HIS FAULT BUT PEOPLE RESPONDING TO THEM IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY WAY. EVERY TIME HE DOES OR SAYS SOMETHING, WHAT HAPPENS IS, EXTRAPOLATING FROM HIS SOMETIMES NOT VERY CLEAR LANGUAGE, PEOPLE DOING OR TRYING TO DO AND REACTS TO THEM ACCORDINGLY. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU ARE I DON'T THINK IT WILL PLAY VERY WELL AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT MAXINE WATERS WAS TALKING ABOUT IS HARMFUL. IT'S NOT PHYSICAL HARM BUT IT'S HARM NONETHELESS. I THINK SHE WILL BE QUIETED BY HER COLLEAGUES. Bret: AND OBVIOUSLY THE PRESIDENT HAS A HISTORY OF BEING A COUNTER PUNCH HER, HE TWEETED OUT, YOU MAY NOT BE HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR. RIGHT WHICH IS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN AS A VEILED THREAT. A THREAT TO DO WHAT? OVER AGAIN. WE NEED TO STOP ALL THIS AND BEGIN TO BEHAVE IN A CIVILIZED
