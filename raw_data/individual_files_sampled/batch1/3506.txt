my name is Jackie Moriarty and I've been a TfL tube driver for 90 liters I didn't I definitely didn't plan to be a train driver when I was growing up I did have a bit of a railway background before I came on to the underground but not was a driver I think it's it's a job that can be completely chilled out until something happens and then you have to react really quickly it's unusual for people to run just as a door is almost closed and pull it back over you see things that you think are quite silly but this is London I think we're we're used to the unusual the things I enjoy about being a train driver is we get free travel on TfL so we get free travel on the tube and the bus it's a job that you can work around family life with the shift system and the systems that they have in place once you get here you can swap for different shifts so you can kind of fit the job around childcare and any other commitments really sometimes it can be a little bit isolating whose are working alone so I suppose that is one of the downsides of the job no two days are the same you can have a very quiet period and then you might have a day where lots of things happen those they sent go quite quickly any job can be boring if you've done it for quite a while but I do enjoy this job and I can see myself staying me on this job you you
