there are different ways to nap and some are good and some are bad power naps are short and restorative a nap of maybe 20 minutes up to 40 minutes during the day and early in the day probably before 2 or 3 o'clock it probably will also help you cut down on your caffeine intake because often people drink a lot of coffee when they're feeling that dip and alertness if you're feeling groggy after a nap you've probably slept for too long you have to know yourself also and if napping doesn't help you don't do it it's more likely to cause a problem for you if it doesn't restore you lengthy naps during the day are actually subtracting sleep from your sleep clock and you will have a harder time falling asleep when you want to and staying asleep throughout the night
