Trump administration's grave a little bit deeper in an interview today with me New York Daily News Giuliani said that about Paul Manafort it's a white-collar crime who the heck is in jeopardy the American public I have as much sympathy for Manta fort as the President does Wow you know what he should they should issue a glossary of terms you know because since truth does isn't truth everything that this this that comes out of fire marshal bills mouth here is always contrary to what the truth is or what right is it's just so it's so disgusting at this point now crime isn't crime no I think I know what you're saying it's definitely in contrary to what what is correct and right and like presidential and legal but he's basically saying that now white-collar crime just isn't crime and and admitting so one admitting this is white-collar crime and then two basically because rich people don't get you know ever accused for the crimes or convicted of the crimes that they commit it's not really a crime what did he earn by with by withholding millions of dollars that could help the public and cheating a businesslike way call people have never done anything to harm anyone by you know miss selling mortgage-backed securities and causing the collapse of the housing nothing why call the people a fight we should prosecute the real criminals who do things like steal baby formula from a store or sell weed to a cancer patient like they're the ones who should be in our jails not these people taking millions of dollars out of the system with their white-collar non-crime all the black guys that that stop-and-frisk was for like all of those brown people who commit those crimes that people who are broke hungry and struggling commit not these guys who are part of the problem for that keep the people who are oppressed down not the cause of the real problem they should not get in trouble only the people who are suffering from the symptoms there is a remarkably liberal statement in the middle of that though that I actually write by Giuliana standards like he's wrong about manifold but he said like who does it who's in jeopardy the American public if he's genuinely arguing for a new standard of criminal punishments where people evaluate whether the American public is genuinely apparel and genuinely a threat from these people's crimes that men don't send them to prisoners as a result he's about to revolutionize the prison industry like millions of people are gonna be freed overnight actually judged crimes based on the harm they're committing to the general public yeah and I think that's what you Deon he was saying right there I think that's the real underlying point that he was going for no this is great and so he it didn't end there of course as interview continued he when talking about whether or not Trump will pardon manna for because remember all this is because manna fort is not on the s list like a metaphor is still a okay Trump is very sympathetic to Paul Manafort because he hasn't quote-unquote flipped which is a word now Trump is using because he is a mob boss but Giuliani did say that Trump does have the power to do it in reference to whether or not to pardon Paul Manafort but that mana Ford is hardly a menace to society just to remind viewers mana for 269 he headed Trump's campaign between May and August 2016 was convicted in Virginia on Tuesday of eight counts of fraud relating to the most shadowy lobbying work he did for pro-kremlin and political forces in Ukraine he faces another trial this is just one trial right there were 18 counts on all convicted of 8 and apparently 10 of them the jury was almost in full union and unanimity about but but didn't get the conviction but he's got another trial coming up on charges of being an unregistered foreign agent for foreign lobbying money laundering and lying to the FBI prosecutors plan to present more than double the amount of evidence in that trial and mana fort could face an additional 20-year sentence if convicted so there's two parts to the story as Francesca just explained let me take them one at a time when Rudy first Sartre earned by pardoning mana for that's obstruction of justice right they're basically saying hey you just got convicted you might spend the rest of your life in prison this would be the time that you would turn on Trump and give evidence that you we know you clearly have about Donald Trump otherwise why are we talking about pardons for this obvious criminal that was just convicted and then he had to take it back because that was so brazen act of obstruction of justice but the way he took back didn't make it any better he's like oh we'll have to wait till Muller's investigation is over then given the pardon well you just promised him a party either way right so that's still obstruction of justice crazy now have some sort of pretence though let him finish the investigation I'm not gonna give you a bribe now I'm gonna wait until after there the police have left and then give you up right yeah that doesn't make it any better but I actually think the first part even though that's the illegal part I think the first part is worse for them because of how over the top offensive it is to the average American so and even Republicans so he said I mean what is he a menace to society and now remember Eric garner was choked to death partly based on his history of selling loose cigarettes meaning cigarettes one time it's not even pot it's just cigarettes to avoid some taxes at the time that he was choked to death he was actually not even doing that he was a good Samaritan on that particular day but people and this the Republicans some Republicans do not agree with us on like all menace to society I mean Jesus and Lord Mercy's one cigarette at a time that's crazy right but now but man oh fort is not a menace to society according to who would be Joey I think this is where he loses even conservatives because he's like what did he what harm did he ever do well he hid that this was one of the eight charges he hits thirty million dollars so that he wouldn't have to pay taxes on it taxes that his bracket is forty percent about forty percent that's twelve million dollars that he took from the American taxpayers because when he doesn't pay you have to pay right and so he basically stole twelve million dollars you'd have any loose cigarettes that is okay he's old twelve million dollars from you guys and and you got to pay more hard-earned taxes and he turns around and goes hey look what else rich people do crime is it really crime I think even cuz servers are gonna hang go and this guy's such a jerk to say the least and they're not buying that and and even the jurors one of the he's like I don't know what the jury was thinking that's another quote he had one of the jurors said I came in wanting to make sure he was innocent because I like Donald Trump but the evidence was overwhelming I couldn't help but convict him that's what they were thinking that's a good juror that's right and that's that's a person who by the way did not come in with a completely open mind but was at least open-minded enough to do her job as a sure yes got like what this guy is ludicrously guilty yes whelming liaupsin and also what about what harm did he do Francesco was talking about the fact that he was funding pro-kremlin Ukrainian government destabilization like oh well how am I see through into the American oh I don't know just a destabilizing the world that's the Ukrainian public come on no and nothing that happens in Ukraine ever spills over to America we're fine metaphors a great guy yeah that'll never fight oh this of course is headed towards what I think we've talked about here a lot which is they know they're guilty and once they get caught the answer is so what so what either that or the very Dave Chappelle I'm sorry officer I didn't know I couldn't do that that's it it's just these are the excuses of pure privilege so what yeah and I'm sorry officer I couldn't do that not even I'm sorry it's like huh what couldn't do that yeah no sorry no no you'd nail the Franchesca this is privileged to find absolutely and and this is rich man's privilege I to commit crime and get away with it and and you if you ever stole anything right and what did they say about Michael Brown that he stole cigarettes or whatever they are it always comes back the cigarettes himself right he stole something that might have been worth a quarter right a quarter of a dollar this guy steals twelve million dollars in one of the eight charges and Juliana's like yeah but he's rich it's really a crime he's one of our guys and that's what we do we protect our own and it's us against them and until the the general public comes to realize that this is a battle of the haves and the have-nots that all the other stuff is a distraction though valid until we start learning solidarity and we stop writing for these parties and start writing for the people we will continue to perish because they don't care about any of us never miss another TYT video by ringing the bell below you'll get notified whenever we
