the US has warned India it could be facing sanctions if Delhi goes ahead with the purchase of the Russian s400 missile defense system we would still have very significant concerns of India pursued major new platforms and systems from Russia there was an impression that we're going to completely protect the India relationship insulate India from any fallout from this legislation no matter what they do the sanctions Act was signed by Donald Trump in 2017 to impose penalties on Russia Iran and North Korea it also allows for moves against any country engaging with Russia's defense or intelligence sectors but the new US defense bill let's the president waive sanctions against some of Washington's partners like India Indonesia and Vietnam if lifting them would benefit us and interests India is now in the final stages of signing off on a six billion dollar deal with Russia for the s400 the technology can engage up to 80 targets at a time with a range of 400 kilometers and it's been described in Western media as one of the best air defense systems on the market however it's that six billion we mentioned that seemingly become a target for Washington sanctions Act while India continues to stress it isn't violating international law by going ahead Kotsay is not a UN act it's a u.s. act we have spoken about the s400 for years not just today the warning from the White House comes just a week before American and Indian top officials are due to meet in New Delhi India is not the first country to come under scrutiny for its dealings with Russia since 2017 Turkey has been under pressure from America for wanting to buy the s400 however Ankara promised it would retaliate against any penalties coming from Washington we spoke to international affairs professor Sir Ian Charlie who believes that India could be pushed into strengthening ties with Russia and China this is a negotiating tactic of trump administration we have seen this many times they try to apply maximum pressure and then they concede and backtrack because they do realize that they have other geopolitical goals in the asia-pacific for which India should be up there in a central player we're passing through a very thorny phase since Donald Trump has taken the White House because he doesn't seem to have that grand strategy for Asia Pacific is also forcing us to rethink our approach to a China and to Russia simply because we need to have our own counter pressure points in order for the Trump administration to understand the importance and the value of India that we are not a banana republic that can be pushed around with blackmail and threats of sanctions Russia is a defense partner and we are going to stay with them s400 triumph is the best surface-to-air missile that suits our geostrategic needs for our self-defense there is no substitute for s400 anywhere in the world the threat is more to do with fears that if the s400 gets mixed up with the f-35 the American fighter jet which we are looking to acquire then the secrets the military secrets will spill out you
