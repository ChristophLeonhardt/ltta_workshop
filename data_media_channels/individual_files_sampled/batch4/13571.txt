in the wake of a project Veritas undercover video that proves CNN is a dishonest biased intellectually bankrupt den of anti-american liars with shriveled Souls that look like the desiccated polyps cursed by the sea witch Ursula in Disney's The Little Mermaid CNN is responded by issuing a statement saying quote we are not covering this story on air and therefore it doesn't exist sort of like the corruption in the Obama administration unquote privately CNN protested strongly against the videos saying they had unfairly shown the news network to be purveyors of false news and had thus interrupted CNN in their important work of firing journalists who had gotten caught reporting stories that weren't true fortunately CNN says their newsroom is still well staffed as many of their reporters have not yet been caught at the same time CNN released a new poll showing that 90% of Americans believe every story that CNN reports and 97% say CNN is the best station ever in the whole wide world and 103 percent says say that anyone who doesn't like CNN is a stinky poopoo head especially if these President of the United States and his mean ugly the poll goes on to predict the Democrats will win every election from now on and then everyone's health care will be free and no one will die also the poll shows 87 percent of Americans say that anyone who doesn't believe CNN polls is a danger to the First Amendment or whichever Amendment has a whole press thing in it meanwhile CNN quote reporter unquote Jim Acosta is very angry because Sean Spicer has stopped allowing cameras during the daily press briefing in a furious on-air rant Acosta said quote freedom of the press will not survive if I can't grandstand on camera by shouting obnoxious yet meaningless questions that I can then play on air to make it seem like I'm a courageous journalist instead of just kind of a loudmouth d-bag unquote by shouting on camera rather than actually reporting Acosta said he was trying to be like his hero dan Rather the revered father of the fake news industry in truth this hasn't been the best time for CNN the crappy news network was forced to fire Kathy gray then after she posed with the facsimile of Donald Trump severed head they then had to fire a Reese's LOM after he posted foul-mouthed tweets about Trump they then had to fire three reporters for publishing a false anti Trump story they then had to admit that every story they had run since Trump was elected had been completely made-up and then the entire staff had to stand in a circle and fire one another until the place was empty finally CEO Jeff Zucker had to sever his own head and punch it in the face while screaming why did you ever leave NBC where you were allowed to just make stuff up all in all the cable station has managed to live up to its slogan the most busted name in news and maybe I've heard that slogan wrong trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show just to give you rest there's a will you know the singing she sits atop see the growth as if it even it's a wonderful thing all right it's mailbag day and if anybody were here with me somebody would shout woohoo but unfortunately out there in law hall they're still building the champagne fountain and corralling the naked dancing girls in the elephants and they're shouting woohoo they would be shouting woohoo if they weren't so busy building our new studios which are going to be like a stately pleasure-dome it will be unbelievable what you see but that we'll get to that I have to say I have to acknowledge that the New York Post stole the punch line of my my opening monologue with their headline I wrote my opening monologue yesterday somewhere in the afternoon and I had the most busted name in news and that's the headline of the New York Post which also had a very good story which I'll get to in a minute before I do I want to say we have a long Clavin this weekend up ahead because it's July 4th so I don't think we'll be on the air either Monday or Tuesday and then we'll be back Wednesday Thursday and I'll do a Friday show and that's how we'll get in at least three shows to make up for that but if you want to a little something to sustain you over the Claver this weekend city journal has a short story of mine a science fiction short story in fact that I think is one of the best short stories I've ever written it's called end of the working-day if you google city journal it won't be posted until Sunday I believe on Sunday it will come up I'll remind you tomorrow and again when we come back but it will get you through the clayvin this weekend so we're still dealing with the fallout of these project Veritas James O'Keefe videos of CNN you know CNN producer basically saying that everything they do is for money and they have no ethics and this Russia story has been nonsense and we now have found out and this is in the New York Post that the real reason CNN had just pulled this story about this guy Anthony what was the name scare Moochie is that what it is yeah Anthony scare Moochie was a friend of trumps and they had this false story saying he was involved with some you know Russian bank or whatever and they had to pull it and they fired three people and this post says now the real reason was because he was threatening a hundred million dollar libel suit it was not because it didn't live up to their journalistic standards because I don't even know what it would mean for something not to live up to their journalistic standards which are so lousy but if you think I was in this opening about CNN I mean you have to see some of the stuff that was going on yesterday was unbelievable before that I have to say if you if you want to be with us for the mailbag that will be after the break where we leave Facebook and YouTube so you will want to come over to the Daily wire comm and you will want to subscribe so a you can be in the mailbag next week and have all your problems solved instead of living the life that you're living now but be because our rates are going up on July 10th right now it is just a lousy eight bucks a month if you subscribe for the year you get been Shapiro's notebook say it's so written with his dad David Shapiro about the 2005 White Sox championship season but even if you just subscribe for a month you can put your questions in the mailbag it's a lousy eight bucks a month but on July 10th our rates go up I think they go up to $15,000 a minute they go up so high that we have to have guys named Shiv come and collect the monthly rent but it will not go up if you've already subscribed I guess you have to subscribe for the year to keep your prices down so do it now do it now alright so if you think I was kidding about Jim Acosta Jim Acosta has just covered himself in shame I mean Jim Acosta is so upset that the good Sean Spicer on his daily briefings turned off the cameras and he did it for an obvious reason with the camera on a cost of becomes a grandstander and I really do think he thinks he's dan Rather because dan Rather used to shout at Richard Nixon they used to shadow and that's how he made his name it ain't reporting it's just grandstanding so they took the camera away and he feels like oh my god is like setting the Constitution on fire I just have to play this one it's all only audio but it is Sean Spicer like to call on another reporter and Jim Acosta is like where are my cameras where are my cameras listen to this ganthet Oh Jane and Sean did you answer whether the president so believed the questions real there's no camera Jim but many of you turn the cameras on why don't we turn the cameras on ken why don't we turn the cameras on I'm sorry did you have to do Jen why not turn the cameras on Shawn they're in a room the lights are on not have been a drastic shift starting for maybe two weeks before president took his first trip abroad but now we see you on camera about once a week is that a new normal that we would expect we just will continue the next thing about the cameras off why are they why did you try to walk we just write us an answer to that tell us why you turn the cameras off why are they optional it's legitimate legitimate questions okay you are a taxpayer prank spokesman try United States over not to use these pivot an explanation as to why the errors are wrong it's doing get this out of the way we address the cameras issue do you think that some days will happen sometimes we want presidents going to speak today in the Rose Garden I want the president's voice to carry the day you know and I think that you know so as I look this is nothing inconsistent with what we said since day one I think that you know I wish Spicer had just been honest with him it's like because we're tired of you making a fool out of yourself by parading yourself on camera and he can't you know you I really do think he wants to be dan Rather and he's getting there dan Rather was kind of a half-wit and made a lot of noise and didn't really do all that much but and and finally ended up in disgrace and I think Jim Acosta is kind of following that career path except a lot faster and Custer tweets does this feel like America where the White House takes questions from conservatives then openly trashes the news media in the briefing room I mean look pal after eight years of letting Obama do whatever he liked let him corrupt the Justice Department without asking any questions letting him corrupt the IRS without asking any questions doing no dives into the corruption that spread like a stain through the Obama administration you have no credibility nobody cares what you think nobody wants to hear you nobody wants to see you on camera it's like so long and you know prick room britt hume was on tucker carlson and normally you know i let other commentators go their way but britt hume has expertise in this because he was in the White House press corps and Tucker asked some asks him you know is it important is it important that there are cameras or whether there are cameras listen to humans response no reporter for a news organization is sizable and it's important to CNN to be relying on the briefings to get news report all right for all a CNN correspondent can get his or her calls returned New York Times reporter Washington Post reporter Fox News correspondent we can get our calls returned at the White House it's for the lots and lots of dozens of smaller news organizations that cover the White House on a daily basis and the briefing is really kind of there for them he gives them a chance to get a question get it answered and then to learn sort of what the schedule for the day is and the rest of it it's you know you if you had a really good question that really led somewhere you've never asked it in the briefing because you find you don't want to inform the entire rest of the press corps what you're working on coming to you and so you were there for a long time for the network's for ABC News did you go to the briefing every day and show questions I went as a rule but most of the time the briefings are not very helpful under any administration I mean you know with the best press secretary in my time was Marlin Fitzwater who was there for breagan and then later for Bush she was very good but often times the briefings aren't particularly informative I use they had a crossword puzzle opener in front of me at the briefings and after a while during the Clinton administration they got to be so on informal dieting and go that's that's what a reporter sounds like he knows that you make the phone calls you talk to the people you get people to go on the record if you get stuff off the record from anonymous sources you confirm it on the record with somebody I mean you know this is the way journalism is done and they're not doing journalism he just wants to shout on camera and be seen okay so CNN wanted stuff on camera boy oh boy they got it because Sarah Huckabee Sanders you know and I believe actually that they should now you know how Melissa McCarthy has been doing that very funny Sean Spicer imitation on Saturday Night Live I believe they should bring Melissa McCarthy in as Spicer's back up and if they're not nice to spy sir this unleash McCarthy honor but Sarah Huckabee Sanders is also proving magus Saunders is also proving to be a spectacular backup for Spicer and he goes in she goes in I'm sorry she goes in and one of the reporters says well you know CNN fired through reporters and they pulled the story why are you still picking on us isn't that enough and here's a response is cut one why is there enough with the question I don't know that it's that the response isn't good enough for the president I think it's the constant barrage of fake news directed at this president probably that has garnered a lot of his frustration you point to that report there are multiple other instances where that outlet that you referenced has been repeatedly wrong and had to point that out or be corrected there's a video circulating now whether it's accurate or not I don't know but I would encourage everybody in this room and frankly everybody across the country to take a look at it I think if it is accurate I think it's a disgrace to all of media to all of journalism I think that we have gone to a place where if the media can't be trusted to report the news then that's a dangerous place for America and I think if that is the place that certain outlets are going particularly for the purpose of spiking ratings and if that's coming directly from the top I think that's even more scary and certainly more disgraceful I hope I hope this new score gets some kind of sexual gratification out of being spanked by women because that's what's happening here it's just it's embarrassing it's embarrassing and of course O'Keefe retweets this now she's directing the public she's on camera directing the public to the okie videos which are just embarrassing for CNN and you know O'Keefe is retweeting this with this cat ate the canary look on his face and CNN is saying well the producer that'll keep caught on tape he's just a minor a medical producer which is what ou keeps waiting for because he was trained up by Andrew Breitbart I mean let me just briefly tell you the story I'll go back to this press conference because it becomes amazing but you know O'Keefe got his start by turning in those acorn videos to Andrew Breitbart and Breitbart called me I remember his December I guess this was 2009 I almost have in December 2008 and he came on and he said I've come into these videos that show this acorn this liberal acorn you know act of this group just so corrupt what that is and it just exposes all this stuff and here's what I'm going to do and he then described permit to me for about an hour his strategy because he knew how corrupt the press was and he knew what they would do he's I'm going to release this part and then they're going to say it's edited and then I'm going to release the whole thing and show that the edited thing is the unedited thing is even worse and then they're gonna say this and I'm going to do this and he's just every single detail he laid it out what the press was going to say because he knew them so well well it did all happened everything happened I mean that was when I just sat back and I thought wow Andrew Breitbart has a genius for the flow of information he knows how corrupt the media is he knows what they're going to do so when CNN came back and said well this guy's a minor a minor producer O'Keefe's tweeted yeah I knew you're going to say that now I'm going to release you know the real tapes that I have the rest of the tapes I have and I just thought well you know it's like Yoda teach the student has become the master and I think Andrew Breitbart would be proud of it was a beautiful beautiful thing to see but before we take the break before we say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube I just want to play this one exchange that's incredible exchange between Sarah Saunders and this reporter who now goes nuts as she is telling them if she is just giving them what for how bad they have been with Donald Trump because they really have been bad and I'll talk about that after the break but just just watch this reporter it is worth it is worth it this is cup three if we make the slightest mistake the slightest word is off it is just an absolute high rate from a lot of people in this room but news outlets get to go on day after day and cite unnamed sources use stories without sources have you know you mentioned the scare emoji story where they had to have reporters resign come on you're on Fleming everybody right here right now with those words this administration has done that as well why in the name of heavens in one of us right are replaceable and any one of us if we don't get it right the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or not read it I think you have been elected to serve for four years at least there's no option other than where it asked you questions right here to provide the answers and what you just said is inflammatory to people all over the country who look at it they see once again the president's right and everybody else out here is fake media and everybody in this room is only trying to do their job so I just disagree completely first of all I think if anything has been inflamed it's the dishonesty that often takes place by the news media and I think it is outrageous for you to accuse me of inflaming a story when I was simply trying to respond to his questions like this snowflake news alright we'll talk more about this after the break and then we will have the mailbag the mailbag your questions answered answers guaranteed a hundred percent correct they will change your life on occasion for the better but you got to come over to the Daily wire comm and hear it and you got to subscribe to be part of it so come on over
