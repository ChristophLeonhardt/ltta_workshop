if it were just a photo-op it might have worked but then the damn fool opened his mouth I want to show you some of the vacuous things our little shiny Pony said while he was down in New York it's just cringing I really think he wrote this speedin speech himself I'll show him anyway he starts off by talking about himself and his life of privilege I think he actually wrote this part of the speech because it's so vain but of course it's his favorite topic him and himself and he's still oblivious to I mean remember he grew up as a trust-fund kid and his his father Pierre Trudeau was a trust fund kid the last Trudeau who worked for a living was his grandfather who he never met so he grew up as a trust fund kid no responsibilities went to school if he wanted to work to our jobs if he wanted to but mainly he didn't want to he was in the air do well he once bragged to an Iranian newspaper about how he had instead of working he visited 90 different countries just as a tourist bum 90 countries and he just sent the bills to Daddy's trust fund lawyers he's doing that again look when I graduated in the early 1990s I went on a trip around the world with a few good friends who actually remained good friends to this day which is a sort of a miracle we trekked and travel mostly overland from Europe to Africa to Asia and that remains one of the great formative experiences of my life it was an amazing adventure hey cool story bro but you know sometimes graduation speakers talk about the graduates you're talking about yourself but not based on any achievement or any vision you have or philosophy you're just talking about your life of unearned luxury as a spoiled rich kid I mean it's funny because he says there was a lesson in it he said that it made him really really really open minded I mean just ask him how open-minded he is it was also an important a really important contributor to my continued broader education because it forced me really for the first time as an adult to meet engage befriend people whose views and experiences ideas values and language were very different from my own really this is the liberal politician who banned literally any pro-life Christians from running as liberal candidates for him he just banned them oh and this summer he literally is banning any pro-life Christian in the entire country from getting a summer job ban on let us say swear they agree with his own particular point of view on abortion gay marriage transgender rights whatever but those NYU students don't know that they just know that a really dreamy cool rich kid told them something very very deep that it's fun to travel around the world on Daddy's money you should try it if you can you guys step one get daddy's money step two travel that's deep man that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
