7
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:14,978

00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:15,879
IS LOOKING ALL THE WAY TO

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,580
THE DAY AFTER ELECTION IN

10
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:17,881

00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:19,983
AND PREDICTING ANOTHER TRUMP

12
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:20,317

13
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:24,354

WITH NEITHER A RECESSION NOR

16
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:30,660
A MAJOR WAR TO RUN AGAINST

17
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:31,561
DEMOCRATS SOUGHT INSTEAD TO

18
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,463
CAST THE ELECTION IN STARKLY

19
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:35,131
MORAL TERMS YET BY ELECTION

20
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:36,299
DAY, THE CHARGE THAT

21
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,902
MR. TRUMP IS MORALLY OR

22
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:39,536
INTELLECTUALLY UNFIT FOR

23
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:44,374
OFFICE HAD BEEN MADE SO

24
00:00:46,277 --> 00:00:46,710
SWING VOTERS.

25
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:47,377
SO, WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD

26
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,813
JOINING US RIGHT NOW IS

27
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:51,348
FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE

28
00:00:51,349 --> 00:00:52,315
DIRECTOR OF TURNING POINT

29
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:53,583
U.S.A. MR. CHARLIE KIRK.

30
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:55,852
STEVE: WHAT IS GOING ON IN

31
00:00:55,853 --> 00:00:57,120
THE PAGES OF THE "NEW YORK

32
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:57,454
TIMES."

33
00:00:57,455 --> 00:00:58,621
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

34
00:00:58,622 --> 00:00:59,289
STEVE: SAYING TRUMP WINS.

35
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,423
>> I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THE

36
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:01,191
"NEW YORK TIMES" HERE.

37
00:01:04,394 --> 00:01:06,363
THE TRAJECTORY BOTH PARTIES

38
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:07,430

39
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:08,465
REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS

40
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:09,199
RIGHTFULLY BECOME THE PARTY

41
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:12,435
AMERICA, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE

42
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:12,902
AND JOBS.

43
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:14,304
AND YOU LOOK AT THE DEMOCRAT

44
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:15,305
PARTY THEY ARE BECOMING THE

45
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:20,677
RADICAL SOCIALIST IDEAS THAT

46
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:23,513
WE CAN POSSIBLY EMBRACE.

47
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:24,447
BRET HITS THE NAIL ON THE

48
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:24,914
HEAD HERE.

49
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:26,316
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME

50
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:28,351
PEOPLE WILL DISMISS A LOT OF

51
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:29,652
THIS NONSENSICAL MEDIA

52
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,356
DONALD TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT

53
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:38,461
AND THINGS ARE IMPROVING.

54
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:39,162
STEVE: JUST LIKE ONCE UPON A

55
00:01:39,163 --> 00:01:39,729

00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,230
ECONOMY, STUPID.

57
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:40,997
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MESSAGE

58
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:41,731
THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO

59
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:44,834
DOLLARS IN EVERYBODY'S

60
00:01:46,637 --> 00:01:48,405

00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:49,906
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE

00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:51,741
COFFERS AT THE U.S. FEDERAL

63
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:52,108
TREASURY.

64
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:53,276
>> SO THE DEMOCRATS' MESSAGE

65
00:01:53,277 --> 00:01:54,477
IS LET'S MAKE GOVERNMENT

66
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,346

COUNTRY IS HEADING.

69
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:06,489
IT'S EVER BEEN.

70
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,457
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS RESTORED

71
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,892
THE IDEA OF AMERICA.

72
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:10,427
IT'S THE RESTORATION OF THE

73
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:10,927
AMERICAN SPIRIT.

74
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:12,629

00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:21,471
MIDDLE AMERICA.

IS HE

92
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:36,920
>> HE IS BREAKING ALL THE

93
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:37,487
CONVENTIONAL RULES.

94
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:38,354
WOULD YOU EVER SEE A

95
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:41,391

104
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:48,798
WE DOING THE TRADITIONAL

00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:52,135
HE COMES FROM A BUSINESS

106
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:52,602
MIND SET.

107
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:53,903
HE COMES FROM A BUSINESS

108
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:55,805
BACKGROUND AND THESE D.C.

109
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:58,108
LOBBYISTS, I

00:03:01,512 --> 00:03:03,780
THEM THAT'S WHY HE WILL

113
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:05,648
CONVINCINGLY WIN

114
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:06,249
RE-ELECTION.

115
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,749
STEVE: INTERESTING

116
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,450
PREDICTION IN THE OP-ED WHO

117
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,218
THEY PREDICTED HIS OPPONENT

118
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:08,585
WOULD BE.

119
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:09,786
AND IT IT WAS ELIZABETH

120
00:03:09,787 --> 00:03:10,120
WARREN.

121
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,658
>> INTERESTINGLY, I CAN

122
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:15,992
AGREE.

123
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,193
CAN I SEE THAT'S THE

124
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:17,794
DIRECTIONS THE DEMOCRAT

125
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:19,162
PARTY IS GOING.

126
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:19,929
THEY CONSIDER ELIZABETH

127
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,331
WARREN TO BE A MODERATE PICK

128
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:22,565
NOW BETWEEN THE MORE VERY,

129
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:27,604
VERY FAR LEFT WING BERNIE

130
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:28,338
SANDERS AND THE MORE KIND OF

131
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:28,872
MODERATE DEMOCRATS.

132
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:29,506
THEY THINK THAT ELIZABETH

133
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:30,140
WARREN IS A MORE MODERATED

134
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:30,740
WAY TO BRING THE PARTY

135
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:31,107
TOGETHER.

136
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:31,641
AND I THINK BRET'S

137
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:32,542
PREDICTION WOULD BE ACCURATE

138
00:03:35,513 --> 00:03:36,346
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BECOME

00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:43,153
THIS WILL IS A LOT OF WORK

142
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:43,786

00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:55,498
PRESIDENT IS ABOUT RESULTS.
