. JESSE: THIS WEEK THE FIRST LADY FAILED HEARD THE BEST ANTI- BULLYING CAMPAIGN. I FEEL STRONGLY THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD BE BEST AT EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN TODAY. I'M VERY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE, THE BEST. JESSE: SHE WAS ATTACKED IMMEDIATELY BY THE MEDIA. THERE'S A LOT OF REALITY SHE'S DEALING WITH. THIS IS THE FIRST LADY WHO IS NOT CULTURALLY AMERICAN. BUT SHE'S LEARNING THE WAYS. THEN GLENN CRITICIZED HER GRAMMAR TWEETING, HER NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS, PREFERABLY THOSE FROM EASTERN EUROPE IS THE BEST AN IDIOM IN YOUR LANGUAGE, AND FAR LEFT HATERS MOCKING HER ACCENT. LADIES, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU. ARE REPUBLICANS SUPPOSED TO BE THE IGNORANT DUMB ONES THAT ARE CRITICIZING THE ACCENTS OF IMMIGRANTS, NOT THE CULTURAL ELITES IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA. DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONES DOING IT. SHE PROBABLY ONLY KNOW HOW TO SPEAK ONE LANGUAGE COMPARED TO OUR FIRST LADY WHO KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK FIVE LANGUAGES. SHE'S DOING A PHENOMENAL JOB. LEAVE HER ALONE. SHE'S DOING A GREAT JOB. TO DEMEAN AND DISPARAGE HER AS SAD. THEY WOULD'VE DONE THIS TO MICHELLE OBAMA. IS A HATE SHOW. YOU MEAN THE HIGH HEEL WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT. THIS TOMATOES ARE PRETTY TALL. ALSO MICHELLE OBAMA SAYS SHE'S CONCERNED ABOUT WOMEN IN AMERICA, LET'S LISTEN. IN LIGHT OF THIS LAST ELECTION, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT US AS WOMEN AND HOW WE THINK,. IF WERE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE NOTION OF OUR WOMAN TO BE OUR PRESIDENT, COMPARED TO WHAT? WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH OURSELVES. JESSE: KANYE NEEDS TO GET TO THE FIRST LADY. ART WOMAN ALLOWED TO VOTE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT HOWEVER THEY WANT? WE ARE ALLOWED. MICHELLE OBAMA, WE DON'T NEED HER OF LECTURING US ABOUT WHO WE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT VOTE FOR. WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS MAYBE ASKED THE QUESTION, MAYBE SHE'S FEELING GUILTY FOR NOT VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON. THE WEATHER SHE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. WAS SHE SUPPOSED TO BE GIVEN UP BY SOMEBODY? AND HILLARY TO RUN TOMORROW WE STILL MOBILE FOR HER EVEN IF SHE TRIED TO LURE US IN WITH HOTDOCS. THAT'S A GOOD POINT. SHE WAS PRO- WOMAN SHE SHOULD OF VOTED AGAINST HER HUSBAND. VOTED FOR HILLARY. JESSE: LASTLY, WE HAVE MAXINE WATERS GOING NUTS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR WITH CONGRESSMAN MIKE KELLY. MAXINE WAS IN HEAVEN IT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WERE MAKING AMERICA GREAT. THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS STOP TALKING ABOUT DISCRIMINATION AND START TALKING ABOUT THE NATION. WERE COMING TOGETHER AS A NATION DESPITE WHAT YOU THINK. I RESENT THE REMARK OF MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. HE'S MAKING A SPEECH ABOUT THIS DISHONORABLE PRESIDENT. I RESERVE THE BALANCE OF MY TIME AND I DO NOT YIELD, NOT ONE SECOND TO YOU. THEY CAN GET A LITTLE FEISTY ON THE FLOOR. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG. THEY'RE UPSET BECAUSE THEY DROPPED THE BOMB ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY NOREEN US AND GIVING US ENOUGH TO KEEP US QUIET. SO BUSINESSMAN CAME ALONG TO PICK UP THE SAME BALL. HE SCORED A TOUCHDOWN BY GIVING US A TAX CUT. SEE NEEDS TO KNOW REPUBLICANS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT GOING TO WORK AND WORK IN. MAYBE SHE NEEDS TO SWITCH HER PARTY TO REPUBLICAN. THEY CALL HER THE POVERTY PIMP BECAUSE SHE LIVES IN A MANSION WHILE HER DISTRICT LIVES IN POVERTY.
