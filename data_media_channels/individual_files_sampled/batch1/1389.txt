dori gold thanks for joining me on upfront in the last couple of weeks the United States government the Trump administration has cut funding to the UN refugee agency which looks after Palestinian refugees has cut funding to Palestinian cancer patients has shut down the Washington DC mission of the PLO the representative body of the Palestinian people you must be delighted we don't get delighted in the problems of the Palestinians you know for us it would be better that these issues not happen and that we could just sit and negotiate and reach an agreement a lot of this is self-inflicted punishment on the part of the Palestinians they knew that if they start playing around with the International Criminal Court there is American legislation that was adopted in 2015 which says that will have implications for their offices in Washington that wasn't the Donald Trump invention that was done back then you say you want to solve the conflict your former ambassador to Washington DC Israeli politician Michael Oren says quote the Americans are punishing the Palestinians in order to make them return to the table what table is that by the way because there doesn't seem to be anything to return to what are you willing to actually offer the Palestinians an actual state well we're not going to start negotiating on television and Michael Oren has his interpretation and it's legitimate mine is a little bit different I have ideas and I've sat with Palestinians for years talking about alternative models for solving this problem let us get to a table and let us put those ideas out and let's try and resolve this once and for all in one's very important sense what President Trump is doing he's trying to introduce realism don't start believing that you didn't get five million refugees to return to Israel it's not going to happen and if you start believing that propaganda you'll never negotiate a solution which people are gonna accept being treated like this year after year decade after decade as the Palestinians have you're only gonna make them much more nationalistic than they already were by treating them in this fashion in my view the important way to move forward is to address the issue of dignity the dignity the Palestinians is more important than the amount of land we're talking about so frankly that's my point of departure it's different than people who just say it's a matter of percentage well it's easy to say the percentage of territory don't matter when you control hundred percent of the territory but just to be clear because I know most members of the Israeli cabinet don't support a two-state solution the Prime Minister himself your former boss your friend Netanyahu has said he is only offering a quote unquote state- to the Palestinians so what is your position Dori Gold do you support a two-state solution and this isn't about negotiating on TV do you support in principle a two-state solution as the end goal to this process quote unquote yes or no I would rather not answer that but I will say that Palestinian self-government does not frighten me I know I don't want to just put things into slogans we have to sit down and work this out right now we now have new regional players who can have a very constructive role I'm talking about the Arab states there's a whole question of of developing facilities for Gaza it mostly can be in Palestinian sovereign territory in the Gaza Strip and Gaza occupied according to the UN it's very difficult most people in the world in most governments of the world including in former Israeli governments said they support a two-state solution or they don't support a two-state solution it's a very simple question do you support a two-state solution I'm gonna take your silences no you don't know I have no problem with a Palestinian state as long as we have defensible borders for Israel and a arrangement that protects religious pluralism in the whole area I don't want to go into further detail than that but I think that we have to retain our vital defense needs and that is not a simple solution the international community shouldn't judge us it shouldn't build up Palestinian expectations that Israel is going to do a striptease and get rid of all the territory it captured in a war of self-defence in 67 it has to come up with I think the international community would say that giving up occupied territories is a striptease sticking with international law but just on the peace plan itself you can't seriously believe that the three people Donald Trump has put in charge of coming up with a peace plan his son-in-law Jared Kushner his former real estate and bankruptcy lawyers David Friedman and Jason Greenblatt none of whom have any experience in diplomacy or peacemaking all of whom are hardcore supporters of illegal settlements two of them have even given money to settlements that's that's the trio that's gonna bring peace to the Middle East seriously you know Jimmy Carter had a secretary of state whose name was Cyrus Vance and he came from the world of Wall Street law firms so you know everybody comes from somewhere the question is whether they have a capacity to listen to come up with creative answers and to keep everybody on board right now everybody who claims that he's knowledgeable about the Middle East has utterly failed there has not been a successful American Peace Initiative really I would say since Camp David with Egypt it's not just about their complete lack of knowledge and qualifications also their blatant bias as plenty of people even in Washington DC of pointed out the u.s. at least pretended to be an honest broker it's never been an honest broker Brit please pretended now it doesn't even bother would you be okay if the US government sent three Arab Americans or conservative Muslim Americans who donated money to Palestinian groups to be their main negotiators on this conflict you'd lose your minds in Israel if that happened I look at the behavior of an individual I don't look at what cards yeah the behavior is that they gave money to illegal settlements how can they be negotiators between Palestine and the Israeli government would you accept negotiators like that if you were a Palestinian what after here I mean here I'm out I speak with Palestinians I have negotiated Palestinians in 1996 i sat with Abu Mazen for hours in Martin in Dick's house in Hertz Aliyah and you know we can work solutions not solve everything but if we show each other respect and if we're serious we can move forward doriga I want to talk about Prime Minister Netanyahu himself you've been a close ally of his for many years now some would say that Netanyahu quite like strongmen and dictators and authoritarian leaders even of the anti-semitic variety he recently cozied up to Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban who's praised Hungary's pro-nazi World War 2 government who traffics an anti-semitic conspiracy theories he just hosted Philippine president rodrigo duterte who's happily compared himself to hitler is this really the company now that the Israeli prime minister keeps you know we are trying to broaden our international connections all around the world in Asia in Africa in Latin America and prime minister has led a an amazing effort to do that you know there's a big difference between Viktor Orban and the anti-semitic party that runs in the Parliament you know you can't you can't give everybody the same a broad-brush he prays he praised the Hungarian leader who worked with the Nazis mikl√≥s horthy are you ok with that now no I don't like that but you know what around the world you have all kinds of governments which you know have all kinds of understandings of history that you don't agree with you have to express your view it's important to stand up in Hungary and talk about the lessons of the Holocaust but you don't have to agree with everything that it's the Viktor Orban has said some would say that it's not a surprise this stance of Netanyahu's given he himself made racist comments about Arab voters coming out to vote in droves during the last election and Israel is becoming a more and more racist place some would say the nation-state law for example controversially passed over the summer says quote the right to exercise national self-determination in Israel is unique to the Jewish people only it makes Hebrew the country's official language downgrades the status of Arabic and establishes Jewish settlement as a national value without mention a single word about equality or minority rights well I suggest you read the Balfour Declaration which envisioned a Jewish homeland it didn't talk about an Arab homeland did that mean that Ward Balfour and the British government were racist prejudicial or they were trying to hell lotta people who had been downtrodden who lost their ancient homeland but were determined to recover it many would argue Lord Balfour was anti-semitic in his past but the point is that many Israeli politicians voted against this law because they don't see it as in line with Jewish history or even with Israeli history this is a new and very right-wing move plenty of Israeli politicians voted against it Israeli Palestinian legislators called it apartheid members of of your own Parliament even the bipartisan head of the Israeli democracy Institute condemned it as an unnecessary embarrassment to Israel it's jingoistic and divisive well you know as director general of Ministry of Foreign Affairs I led Israeli delegations to South Africa I sat with the foreign minister of South Africa and no one calls us an apartheid state because they understand the real suffering under apartheid and they don't want to you know brand us with that accusation and they know that in apartheid South Africa there were hospitals for blacks and hospitals for whites you've got to be emergency room and Hadassah Hospital and you will see Jewish doctors taking care of Arab patients and the other way around we are not an apartheid state we are a state with equality for all people that's completely false what you just said plenty of senior ANC politicians South African anti-apartheid campaigners have called Israel an apartheid state Desmond Tutu has talked about seeing apartheid on the ground when he visited is around in the occupied territories but put that to one side whether it's apartheid or not what would you call a country in which one group of people have an exclusive right to self-determination based on race and religion and 20 percent of the population doesn't what do you call that country if not apartheid because that's what your nation state law is enshrined a nation state law has nothing new in it it has to do with constitutional problems we have in Israel the President of Israel intervened in the debate come on Dorie Gould you're misleading the audience you know it was a hugely controversial law the president of your country intervened to condemn an earlier version of it please do not say this is just some uncontroversial continuation of the Balfour Declaration don't insult our intelligence no it is an internal debate it is a legitimate internal debate that has to do with the powers of the Supreme Court and its effect no it's so true it specifically says Oh only the Jewish people in Israel have a right to self-determination where does that leave the 20% of the population who are Palestinian I think that the law is there to make clear that Israel is the National homeland of the Jewish people that's and that's why it was set up a very specific question during gol-do Palestinians in Israel have a right to self-determination where are they second-class citizens behind the Jews who have it exclusive a unique right is what the law says to self-determination a unique right for one group of people the State of Israel was set up originally because the Jews had been so discriminated against and so oppressed in countries leading up to the Holocaust that there had to be one homeland one place where they could claim a right of self-determination that's all that law was referring to so do you deny Palestinian self-determination inside of Israel Palestinian cities of Israel have no right to self-determination you agree with the law on that yeah I would say I would deny the rights of Canadians to have self-determination inside the United States I would deny the rights of Mexicans they have a right of self-determination in some Palestinians say you're now telling us on this TV show that one-fifth of the population of Israel are foreigners they are equivalent to Canadians living in the United States that's quite an admission I've interviewed Israelis for years and I've always been told by Israeli spokesmen everyone's equal in Israel you're now saying no Palestinians are the equivalent of Canadians in America that's an astonishing statement well I am saying that we have a state for the Jewish people that has been established we have to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and there will be a Palestinian national entity where their national self expression can be fully expressed dori gold I don't want to put words in your mouth just to be very clear are you saying that the one-fifth of the Israeli population who are Palestinians who you told me a moment ago are equally treated in Israeli hospitals that they should leave to go to a Palestinian state now under this law I didn't say that I didn't say they have to leave this is going to be a state is a state for the Jewish people that will give equality to others who live here whether they are Palestinian no more sense whether they are Druze or whatever their national and religious background dori gold will have to leave it there thank you for joining me on upfront
