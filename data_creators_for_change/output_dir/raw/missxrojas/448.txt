<font color="#E5E5E5">school's founder today Founders Day</font>

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,969
which basically means a day where they

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,710
have lots of kind of rides and fun stuff

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,660
to do and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> food everywhere and</font>

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,550
there's performances live acts they had

disbanded Torah in what I keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling</font>

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,539

combination thing but no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no really</font>

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,240
really good beautiful day

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,160
until the evening they had fireworks and

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,470
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a screening of Mary Poppins and all</font>

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,880
sorts of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and it was so</font>

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,590
much fun even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though we share moments of</font>

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,560
you know my personal breakdowns and how

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,870
stressed I am and that you meet quite a

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,940
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my friends I don't share too much</font>

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,800
about the specifics of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> life like I</font>

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,990
didn't tell you until last week that I

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,160
was about sorry I didn't tell you

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,930
specifically any of that I do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

23
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,820
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> like practical Internet safety</font>

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,710
reasons but it's nice knowing that I

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,140
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that much time left abasa and</font>

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,670
being able to actually talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,020
specifically because it's a very like

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,729
unique environment and it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much</font>

29
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,890
fun that it's nice to be able to tell

30
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,530
you things about<font color="#CCCCCC"> basa in particular so</font>

31
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,440
that's kind of one thing that they're

32
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,540
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having much time left it has freed</font>

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,460
me up to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so much</font>

34
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,590
fun but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was absolutely exhausted</font>

35
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,720
especially cuz the Sun was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so hot</font>

36
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,040
and it was such a nice day that it just

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,050
completely drains all the water out of

38
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,850
the system so today three of my friends

39
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,190
and I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a walk batter has this</font>

40
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,780
really cool farm like ecological

41
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,610
preserve area and if you walk past there

42
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,410
you can kind of walk through this forest

43
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,210
trail and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's beautiful and we were</font>

44
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,490
walking for about an hour and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a half or</font>

45
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,020
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> you or maybe even more than that and</font>

46
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,580
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so lovely and it felt kind</font>

47
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,590
of like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were exploring and going on</font>

48
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,229
an adventure George George George of the

49
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,700
jungle jungle VIP

50
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,939
yeah broken

51
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,820
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> strange to think that there's only</font>

52
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,530
three weeks left and there's still so

53
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,360
much a batter itself from the area the

54
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,530
immediate surrounding area that I

55
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,360
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen and of the states in</font>

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,310
general because I'm not able to do all

57
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,540
the traveling that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

58
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,160
originally but I've still done so much

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,660
traveling every time I come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from a</font>

60
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,940
trip or put<font color="#CCCCCC"> up photos or talk to people</font>

61
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,830
even make a video about it someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

62
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US always says you've seen so much</font>

63
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,430
more of America than I ever have and

64
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,440
it's strange how that time crunch like

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,360
knowing you're about to leave pushes you

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,340
to see even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and even more almost in</font>

67
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,830
a panic diversion of I haven't seen an

68
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,120
opiate habit enough yet I might never

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,380
get the chance to do this again<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

70
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,420
kind of panicked rushing around and that

71
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,010
has shown itself in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

72
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,450
footage that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have that I haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

73
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,580
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to edit and the amount footage I</font>

74
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,140
have on these little memory cards I have

75
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">three memory cards and they're all just</font>

76
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,770
full and I can't put the footage on my

77
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,030
computer because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a third on my</font>

78
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,380
computer that I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough space</font>

79
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,360
to edit an export<font color="#CCCCCC"> and my external hard</font>

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,520
drive is all filled up so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font>

81
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting it was really nice to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

82
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to go like a Sunday walk really</font>

83
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,680

86
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,980
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next two weeks I'm hoping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

87
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,930
kind of knock them out the park nice and

88
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,760
early don't think that's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

89
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,470
said I have even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more time to explore</font>

90
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,110
take video and show it to you all whilst

91
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,730
I can't promise that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exploration</font>

92
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,680
format will keep up in the UK it will be

93
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my mindset of of</font>

94
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,330
taking camera all the time which I

95
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,950
didn't used to be as proficient at

96
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,110
translates to run on back home I mean we

97
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,150
shall see I'd be interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if</font>

98
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,980
any of you especially those of you who

99
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,840
have gone abroad or who know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

100
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,480
moving away from an area and really felt

101
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the push to explore that place even</font>

102
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,040
more or whether that's just something

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:00:00,000
random<font color="#CCCCCC"> look flew into my head</font>
