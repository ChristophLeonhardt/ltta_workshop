1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
I'm I'm wondering what you can tell the
people of Texas to expect in terms of

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,250
long-term recovery efforts and in
particular you have been feuding with

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,290
some key congressional leaders you've
also threatened a government shutdown

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,710
potentially next month over border wall
funding or these going to hamper

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,850
long-term the the funding that will be
needed long-term for recovery no Todd I

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,689
think that you're gonna see very rapid
action from Congress certainly from the

7
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,420
president and you're going to get your
funding it's a terrible tragedy your

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,579
governor has been absolutely outstanding
and the job he's done and his entire

9
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:46,620
staff and I will say that I just spoke
with Greg and he is working like 24/7 we

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,270
expect to have requests on our desk
fairly soon and we think that Congress

11
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,309
will feel very much the way I feel
they're in a very bipartisan way that

12
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,760
will be nice but we think you're going
to have what you need and it's going to

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,129
go fast Texas is a unique place it's a
great great state great people and I

14
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,400
think you'll be up and running very very
quickly really very quickly so yeah I

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,450
think you're gonna be in fantastic shape
I've already spoken to Congress and

16
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,600
everybody feels for you and feels for
what you're going through but at the

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,830
same time they have great respect even
additional respect for the state because

18
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,200
you've handled it so well so brilliantly
but it's a long road still pouring still

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,350
a lot of rain nobody has ever seen
anything like it they've heard the words

20
00:01:31,350 --> 00:00:00,000
epic I've heard historic that's what it
is
