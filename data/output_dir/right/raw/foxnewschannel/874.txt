1
00:00:00,176 --> 00:00:01,310
AND NOT TURN AGAINST THE

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:01,677
PRESIDENT.

3
00:00:01,677 --> 00:00:04,414
>>  WELL, HE'S GOT A LOT OF TIME

4
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:05,848
TO THINK ABOUT IT NOW.

5
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:07,650
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

6
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,452
DURING TODAY'S SPUR OF THE

7
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:13,289
MOMENT MEDIA BLITZ, HE CALLED

8
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,057
KIM JONG-UN A STRONG HEAD OF

9
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:15,358
STATE.

10
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:17,794
THEN HE MADE THIS COMMENT THAT

11
00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:19,295
RAISED SOME EYEBROWS.

12
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:20,596
>>  I WANT MY PEOPLE TO DO THE

13
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:20,897
SAME

14
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:22,532
>> WHAT DID YOU MEAN JUST NOW

15
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:25,134
WHEN YOU SAID YOU WISHED

16
00:00:25,134 --> 00:00:28,070
AMERICANS STOOD UP AT ATTENTION?

17
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,440
>>  I'M KIDDING.

18
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:40,550
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SARCASM.

19
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,854
>>  HE DOES SPEAK OFTEN IN

20
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:46,589
HYPERBOLE AND SARCASM.

21
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:47,323
>>  HE DOES.

22
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:49,392
HE HAD A CHANCE TO ANSWER THAT

23
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:51,127
ONE WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT.

24
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:53,296
HE SAID HE WAS JOKING.

25
00:00:53,296 --> 00:00:55,765
HE DOES OFTEN MAKE COMMENTS THAT

26
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:59,569
ARE POSITIVE OR PRAISING OF

27
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:01,337
DICTATORS AND HARDLINE LEADERS,

28
00:01:01,337 --> 00:01:03,906
AND THAT COMES IN THE CONTEXT OF

29
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:05,775
WHERE HE WAS DOING THE OPPOSITE

30
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:10,012
IN MANY CASES ABOUT U.S. ALLIES.

31
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:10,947
>>  THERE IS NOW TALK ABOUT

32
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:13,115
WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL SIT DOWN

33
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:18,271
WITH PUTIN FOR A FACE HF

34
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:18,454
WITH PUTIN FOR A FACE H

35
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:18,488
WITH PUTIN FOR A FACE-T

36
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:18,521
WITH PUTIN FOR A FACE-TO-

37
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:18,554
WITH PUTIN FOR A FACE-TO-FA

38
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:18,821
WITH PUTIN FOR A FACE-TO-FACE

39
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:19,155
MEETING.

40
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:20,122
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.

41
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,324
>>  IT'S POSSIBLE.

42
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:23,493
AND I THOUGHT THIS ALL STARTED

43
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:26,395
BECAUSE ONE OF YOU ASKED, SHOULD

44
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:28,598
PUTIN BE IN THE G7.

45
00:01:28,598 --> 00:01:30,199
HE SHOULD BE IN THE G8.

46
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:33,035
A FEW YEARS AGO, PUTIN WAS IN

47
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:36,439
WHAT WAS CALLED THE G8.

48
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,673
I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE

49
00:01:37,673 --> 00:01:39,475
RUSSIA IN THAN OUT.

50
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:42,578
>>  THEY ARE MAJOR PLAYERS IN

51
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:43,980
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING FROM

52
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,814
SYRIA, TO NORTH KOREA, THE

53
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:45,248
MIDDLE EAST.

54
00:01:45,248 --> 00:01:46,816
IF YOU'RE GOING TO WORK ON

55
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:49,385
SOLVING THOSE KINDS OF PROBLEMS,

56
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:50,620
HE WANTS THEM TO BE AT THE

57
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,722
TABLE.

58
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:54,490
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE NEGOTIATING IN

59
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:54,790
VAIN.

60
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,759
>>  HE'S TAKEN A LOT OF HEAT FOR

61
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,693
SOMETIME FOR THE RELATIONSHIP HE

62
00:01:57,693 --> 00:02:00,263
HAS WANTED TO BUILD WITH RUSSIA.

63
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:02,131
HE HAS THIS RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

64
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:03,032
GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME.

65
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:05,234
SO THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL

66
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:07,537
RISK AND HEAT FOR HIM THERE

67
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:07,870
ANYWAY.

68
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,774
AND THERE'S THE FACT THAT PUTIN

69
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:15,478
WAS KICKED OUT OF THE G8.

70
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:19,515
THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS FOR

71
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:20,950
RUSSIA NOT TO BE AT THAT TABLE.

72
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,054
BUT AS YOU SAID, HIS VIEW IS HE

73
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:25,955
WANTS TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

74
00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:27,290
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN.

75
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,691
HE WANTS TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

76
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,525
WITH KIM JONG-UN.

77
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,294
HE WANTS TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

78
00:02:31,294 --> 00:02:32,595
WITH THESE LEADERS BECAUSE HE

79
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:33,796
THINKS THAT WILL BE PRODUCTIVE

80
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:34,997
FOR THE UNITED STATES.

81
00:02:34,997 --> 00:02:38,067
>>  HE DOES TALK ABOUT THESE

82
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,669
DIFFERENT COALITIONS IN TERMS OF

83
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:40,202
RELATIONSHIP.

84
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,804
EVEN WHEN ASKED ABOUT GOING INTO

85
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:43,739
NORTH KOREA AND SITTING DOWN AND

86
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,742
BEING CRITICIZED FOR NOT DOING

87
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:47,777
PREPARATION.

88
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:51,581
WE WERE TOLD HE WAS BRIEFED

89
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:52,715
REPEATEDLY, BUT HE KEPT TALKING

90
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:54,884
ABOUT THE FACT THAT, FOR ME IT'S

91
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:55,518
A RELATIONSHIP.

92
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:57,553
I WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN CONNECT.

93
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,355
AND NOW HE SAYS WE DID.

94
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:00,389
>>  EXACTLY.

95
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,058
HE WAS A LEADER BOTH BEFORE HE

96
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,759
BECAME A POLITICIAN AND NOW IN

97
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,761
THE WHITE HOUSE HE OPERATES VERY

98
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:08,297
MUCH ON INSTINCT AND BUILDING

99
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:09,298
THAT RELATIONSHIP.

100
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:11,200
NOW NOT EVERYONE THINKS THAT'S

101
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,070
GOOD ENOUGH, BUT THAT'S A LOT OF

102
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,838
WHERE HIS CONFIDENCE COMES FROM.

103
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:20,076
>>  WERE YOU SURPRISED AT ALL BY

104
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:21,010
THIS TODAY?

105
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,213
HE TALKED ABOUT HE WAS GOING TO

106
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:27,383
BE ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN.

107
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:28,851
BUT SOMETIMES I THINK HE PREFERS

108
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:30,086
OFF THE CUFF.

109
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:32,755
AND YOU CAN GET GOOD STUFF FROM

110
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,157
HIM, AT LEAST INTERESTING STUFF.

111
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:37,059
>>  HE LIKES TO SURPRISE PEOPLE

112
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:38,227
AND REPORTERS.

113
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:39,795
HE DOES COME AND TALK TO

114
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:40,896
REPORTERS OFTEN, WHETHER IT'S

115
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:42,999
WHAT HE DID TODAY, WHICH WAS

116
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:46,168
UNUSUAL FOR SURE, OR WHEN ON HIS

117
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:50,439
WAY TO THE HELICOPTER.

118
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,609
WE GET CHANCE TO ASK HIM

119
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:53,976
QUESTIONS.

120
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,177
>>  THE SHOUTED QUESTION WITH

121
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:56,879
HIM USUALLY PAYS OFF, EVEN AS

122
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,048
THE HANDLERS ARE SAYING, "THAT'S

123
00:03:59,048 --> 00:00:00,000
IT, GET OUT."
