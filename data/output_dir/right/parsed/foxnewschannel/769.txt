>> President Trump: I HAVE
ALWAYS SAID THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IS HAVING A GREAT
FAMILY.
THE FAMILY IS MOST IMPORTANT.
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE,
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE
HAPPIEST THE WAY THEY HAVE A
GREAT FAMILY.
>> Martha: PRESIDENT TRUMP
TALKS ABOUT THE LOVE FOR HIS
FAMILY.
A NEW BOOK CLAIMS TO HAVE
INSIDE SCOOP ABOUT WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO BE A TRUMP.
HERE NOW IS EMILY JANE FOX
AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "BORN
TRUMP: INSIDE AMERICA'S FIRST
FAMILY."
AS YOU POINT OUT IT'S A BOLD
COVER LIKE EVERYTHING TRUMP.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Martha: IT'S INTERESTING.
SO YOU ARE TAKING A LOOK AT --
I'M SURE THEY WOULD LOVE THE
TITLE.
"INSIDE AMERICA'S FIRST
FAMILY."
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT HOW THEY
GOT HERE.
>> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
A STORY IN WHICH I DON'T THINK
ANY OF THEM TRULY THEMSELVES
BELIEVED THEY WOULD BE HERE.
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A DISSTINCT
AND A UNIQUE FIRST -- DISTINCT
AND UNIQUE FIRST FAMILY.
THE ONLY OF ITS KIND.
WAY TONIGHT TRY TO GET UNDER
THE HOOD AND UNDERSTAND WHO
THE PEOPLE WERE.
WHERE THEY CAME FROM.
SO IT'S SORT OF UNDERSTAND
WHERE THEY WILL GO.
>> Martha: HOW DID YOU DO
THAT?
>> I INTERVIEWED 150 PEOPLE
FOR THE BOOK.
I HAVE BEEN COVERING THEM FOR
"VANITY FAIR" FOR THREE YEARS
SO FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
CLOSEST TO THEM, FRIENDS,
BUSINESS ASSOCIATES TO SOMEONE
WHO HAD A TENNIS MATCH AT
IVANKA AT BOARDING SCHOOL WHEN
SHE WAS A TEENAGER.
>> DID YOU TALK TO THEM,
THEMSELVES?
HAVE YOU MET ANY OF THE KIDS?
>> I HAVE.
I HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON THEM
FOR A LONG TIME.
YOU INTERACT WITH THEM IN THE
NORMAL REPORTING.
SO THIS IS NOT AUTHORIZED
BIOGRAPHY.
BUT I FEEL IT'S THE CLOSEST TO
THE TRUTH AS I COULD POSSIBLY
GET INTERVIEWING --
>> Martha: WHAT WERE THE
IMPRESSIONS OF THEM, DON
JUNIOR AND ERIC AND IVANKA
WHEN YOU MET THEM PERSONALLY?
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK, AND I
THINK THE BOOK SHOWS THIS AS
WELL, THEY ARE A LOT MORE
HUMAN AND A LOT MORE NORMAL
AND LESS SCRIPTED WHEN YOU GET
CLOSER TO THEM.
I THINK THEY HAVE SPENT THEIR
WHOLE LIVES IN FRONT OF THE
CAMERA AND ARE ON GUARD AND
HAVE A CERTAIN IMAGE THEY WANT
TO PROJECT.
WHEN YOU ARE CLOSER TO THEM
AND AS THE CLOSE FRIENDS WILL
DESCRIBE AS WELL THEY ARE MUCH
MORE DOWN TO EARTH, FUNNIER,
MORE THEMSELVES.
>> Martha: THEY ARE JUST,
THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS.
>> SURE!
>> Martha: I THINK SOMETIMES
IT'S LIKE A DIFFERENT
PERCEPTION.
ABSOLUTELY THEY ARE.
I HAVE MET ALL OF THEM AND HAD
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK
PERSONALLY WITH THEM.
YOU KNOW SO WAS THAT A CONCERN
OF YOURS AS YOU WROTE THIS?
THAT THEY, YOU KNOW, YOU
DIDN'T WANT THEM TO BECOME
CARICATURES?
>> WHAT I WANTED THEM NOT TO
BE WERE CARICATURES.
THAT WAS MY WHOLE POINT OF
WRITING THIS.
WE HAVE SEEN FOR YEARS BECAUSE
THEY HAVE BEEN FAMOUS FOR SO
LONG THE PERSONAS THAT WEREN'T
NECESSARILY AS CLOSE TO THE
TRUTH AS WE COULD GET.
BECAUSE THEY HAD SO MUCH POWER
AND ARE WORLD FAMOUS NOW I
WANTED TO GET CLOSER TO THE
TRUTH OF THEM.
THAT IS WHAT I SET OUT TO DO
REPORTING THIS.
>> Martha: WHAT IS THE MOST
MISUNDERSTOOD ABOUT IVANKA FOR
EXAMPLE?
>> I THINK SHE IS MUCH FUNNIER
IN PERSON.
I THINK SHE AS ALL OF HER
FRIENDS DESCRIBE, SHE IS NOT
NECESSARILY AS SCRIPTED OR AS
STAYED AS SHE CAN SEEM.
>> Martha: WHEN I WATCH, I
WATCH SOME OF THE OTHER
INTERVIEWS YOU DID ON THIS,
IT'S LIKE SHE IS HARSH, LIKE
SHE IS EVIL AND NOT PRESENTING
HER FATHER -- SHE IS
MISREPRESENTING CHILDREN AND
WOMEN.
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?
>> I THINK IN HER WHITE
HOUSE -- THE BOOK STOPS AT
INAUGURATION.
I TALK ABOUT HER IN THE WHITE
HOUSE, THAT IS NOT WITHIN THE
BOOK.
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE
TIMES WHERE I FEEL LIKE SHE
HAS BEEN QUIETER IN HER ROLE
AS AN ADVOCATE THAN PERHAPS A
NORMAL ADVOCATE RIGHT BE.
SHE IS IN THE ROLE AS A FIRST
DAUGHTER AND IT'S A TRICKY
ROLE.
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH HER
FATHER IS COMPLICATED.
>> Martha: ANYONE IN THAT
ROLE WANTS THAT TO BE --
>> THAT IS WHY IT'S UNUSUAL TO
HAVE DAUGHTER IN THE WHITE
HOUSE.
>> Martha: MELANIA TRUMP'S
JACKET.
WHAT IS SHE DOING?
>> SHE IS INCREDIBLY CAREFUL
ABOUT HER CHOICES.
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO
FASHION.
SHE THINKS ABOUT EVERY MESSAGE
SHE IS GOING TO SEND.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MESSAGE
