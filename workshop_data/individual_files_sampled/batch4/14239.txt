people talk to me about this show and the show has been growing knock on boy I couldn't be happier with people like if they feel the editorial standards are actually higher because we don't have what you said that that corporate infrastructure no tendon bite I could tell you drew I don't get I mean man Managing Editors tough and she wants things to be buttoned up and she wants to make sure the sources are sound but rarely do I get a veto on the content well to be fair John it was weird I that's the way I felt about HLN for a long time no one ever told me what to talk about but it was interesting when the heat went up during the campaign suddenly that seemed to change a little bit again and it got very uncomfortable I was surprised yeah that was that situation there where all you did was comment on what you observed as a physician for many years and one of them I would argue one of the best-known positions in the world your brand has been a big brand for a long time and all you did was make an innocuous comment and and look full disclosure you and I had that conversation we all had dinner after I was on your show one night we had that comment oh I don't know about a month or so before you we talked about situations at Hilary's help and I had said to you so my law enforcement sources had seen certain things and then you said nothing more on air in my opinion and other people were saying here's here's here's out actually here's the night before I was on Don lemons show and he goes let's talk about Donald Trump's mental health but I went okay let me do an assessment I did about 10 minutes on you know I was saying I don't know what that's good or bad but you know here's here's what I observe and you know it looks like like many businessman hypomania and maybe some narcissism this kind of stuff and okay that's a lot of business better that way I don't know it's good or bad I'm not passing judgment on it but I'm doing you know 30,000 foot assessment on somebody I don't know next day my radio John manager goes our program director goes he do 30 says that they'd convinced at the 30 seconds and do that for our website write that down did it and as I was standing up he goes you got 30 seconds with Hillary - maybe I ought to do that and I said well you know they just released her medical records her doctors just released for they released a formal description of her medical history and I said I'm very concerned about some of the choices her doctors are making I didn't say anything about that's right that's right you did but you in harm's way well shoot hardly because of the doctors but the choices I was being critical as a peer of the some of the things they were doing and I still have some concerns but one of the things I remember you saying is that you just and I thought it was it was a very sound and professional medical observation you could did that some of the medications were old-fashioned and they were they were old-fashioned and they might be causing some of the problems that they were then treating and it was just it it didn't look right to me and and she had a midbrain stroke and she had intranuclear of tallip legion and they were machado transverse sinus thrombosis that's a really unusual and really serious problem and no one was sort of taught speaking about that and their physicians were sort of they were dealing with it as a serious thing but they were dealing with the way that was III didn't seem sophisticated to me and and so I brought I just said that and and by the way her Pete her medical team responded to almost everything I put out there as though they were interrogatory good but your observation was really sound based on a medical patient yeah I don't do it right and you copy out in it I do remember that you probably on it with hey I'm just worried that a woman who has access to the medical care she has isn't getting the best medical care not only that what I saw is something I see with important people all the time that's my I told me might be going on which is the doctors are so sort of turned on by taking care of important and celebrities and powerful people they kind of let the patient call the shots a little bit or they are they they just use their normal judgment they're not objective and and I think that was and I've been certain layer documents have shown that them I in my instincts were right on that no they were and so so in the final analysis was that what what caused the departure from HLN is that what's been done at all not at all that's the other thing that's the craziness if we'd already decided to stop the show and I and I told them I'd be happy to go public and say hey these two things were not related and shut up just shut up just go okay if you like this content please subscribe to our premium service at www.mediaed.org the rebel app it is absolutely awesome much more efficient and easy way to get all of our great content I use it myself every day you're already a subscriber thank you very very much thank you so much for watching I'll be back with you tomorrow you
