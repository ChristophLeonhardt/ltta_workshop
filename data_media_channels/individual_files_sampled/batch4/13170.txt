I so the Washington free beacon did a mash-up of Cory Booker talking about how he had violated the rules with George Costanza from Seinfeld talking about how he was the bad man and it really does fit I mean Cory Booker is a nerd pretending to be the bad guy here so that he's cool at the base he's gonna wear a leather jacket and ride a motorcycle so that the base will love him and vote for him in 2020 here's cory booker pretending to be Spartacus I will say that I did willingly violate the chairs rule on the committee confidential process I take full responsibility for violating that sir and I violated because I sincerely believe that the public deserves to know this nominees a record in this particular case his record on issues of race and the law and I could not understand and I violated this rule knowingly why why these issues should be withheld from the public now I appreciate the comments of my colleagues this is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an I am Spartacus moment is there one is that he violated the Senate rules two are the documents that he actually released or somehow damaging to Brett Kavanaugh not a single thing he said there is true including that this is an I am Spartacus moment I've already said this morning on Twitter I took a Twitter poll as to what President Trump should call him in the inevitable tweet right there will be a tweet from President Trump about Cory Booker I'm pushing all of my friends at the White House to get the president to nickname him far takus I just think that the alternatives are crying Cory there's also drama queen Cory they're there a few there are a few possibilities but I think far takus is clearly the best and I'll be very disappointed in the president if he goes with cry in somebody else he's already done crying for I think a couple of other folks he needs to get more creative with the insults in any case it turns out none of this is true so Cory Booker releases these documents number one he didn't actually release the documents they were released earlier that morning so he didn't violate any a Senate rule which he knew when he said this that's number one number two the documents that he released about Brett Kavanaugh are the things the American public had to see because me cannot have this veil of ignorance placed upon our eyes so that we don't know who will enter it we must know every it turns out what are those documents show shows Brett Kavanaugh is a lawyer who knows things and also opposed to racial profiling after 9/11 the specific email chain he's talking about there we need to know what he thinks about racial profiling what does Brett Kavanaugh actually say in those emails he says racial profiling is probably unconstitutional so we shouldn't do it so well done Cory Booker just well done what's hilarious about this is even even members of the left-wing media who are prepared to praise Cory Booker who are prepared to treat him as Spartacus rather than Farkas even those members of the media had to actually ask him some tough questions and Cory Booker had no answer so Anderson Cooper who's predisposed to sort of like this this kind of drama he starts asking cory booker questions and watch as cory booker's eyes roll up into the back of his head and he starts murmuring in tongues
