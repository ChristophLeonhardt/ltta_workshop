>> IT DOES APPEAR, AS YOU SAY,
THE ORDEAL FOR PASTOR BRUNSON
IS OVER AFTER TWO YEARS UNDER
ARREST YEAR.
A YEAR AND A HALF IN JAIL AND A
HALF YEAR IN HOUSE ARREST WE
LEARNED ALTHOUGH BEING
CONVICTED OF TERROR CHARGES HAS
HAD THE TRAVEL BAN LIFTED,
HOUSE ARREST LIFTED AND CONTROL
ORDER LIFTED AND HE WAS
SENTENCED TO TIME SERVED.
THE PATH IS CLEAR FOR HIM TO
RETURN TO THE U.S.
THE TRIAL WENT QUICKLY.
THEY HAD A FEW WITNESSES,
BRUNSON WAS ASKED TO SAY A FEW
WORDS.
HE SAID I AM INNOCENT, PLEASE
LET ME GO.
AND THEN A FEW HOURS LATER THE
JUDGE MADE THIS RULING.
THIS WOULD NEVER BE DECIDED IN
THE COURTHOUSE BEHIND ME.
IT WAS MORE POLITICAL TRIAL.
WE'VE HEARD HIM CALLED A PAWN
OF THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT.
HE WAS SENTENCED -- FACING 35
YEARS FOR TERROR AND ESPIONAGE
CHARGES CONNECTED TO THE FAILED
COUP WHO TOOK PLACE HERE.
PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS RIDICULOUS.
A PILLAR OF THE CHRISTIAN
COMMUNITY, GENTLE MAN AND USED
AS A PAWN.
NOW HE IS RELEASED.
WE'RE GETTING EVIDENCE
YESTERDAY IT CAME DOWN TO AN
AGREEMENT MADE YESTERDAY.
TURKEY HAS BEEN SUFFERING
FINANCIALLY AND THIS MAY NOW BE
PASTOR BRUNSON COMING BEHIND US
AND I'LL LET YOU SEE HIM.
THIS MAY BE THEM LEAVING THE
COURTHOUSE.
THE MILITARY CONVOY, THIS IS
THE WAY HE CAME IN.
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET A
GLIMPSE OF HIM THROUGH THE
WINDOW HERE.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT PERHAPS
WAS PASTOR BRUNSON ON HIS WAY
TO FREE DEVELOPMENT AS I SAID,
THIS HAS BEEN POLITICAL AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE IT A
CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO GET
UNLAWFULLY HELD AMERICANS FREE.
HERE TODAY IT APPEARS WE HAVE
ONE MORE COMING HOME AND GREAT
NEWS OUT OF TURKEY.
TO BE HONEST IT COULD HAVE GONE
EITHER WAY AS OF YESTERDAY.
HE HAD A COURT CASE FOUR MONTHS
AGO A JET WAITING TO TAKE HIM
HOME AND THE TWO COUNTRIES
COULD NOT AGREE.
TODAY IT APPEARS THAT HAS GONE
THROUGH.
WE DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF
THAT DEAL.
WE DO KNOW THAT TURKEY WANTED
RELIEF FROM SOME TARIFFS AND
SANCTIONS.
WE'LL WAIT TO FIND OUT ABOUT
THAT.
CERTAINLY TODAY A GREAT DAY.
ALTHOUGH SENTENCED TO TERROR
CHARGES HE IS ONLY HAVING TO DO
TIME SERVED.
THE HOUSE ARREST LIFTED, TRAVEL
BAN LIFTED.
CONTROL ORDER LIFTED.
PAVING THE WAY FOR A RETURN TO
THE U.S.
BACK TO YOU.
>> Jon: WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
HIS HEALTH?
HE WAS IN A TURKISH PRISON BUT
WAS RELEASED SUPPOSEDLY FOR
HEALTH REASONS AND RELEASED
INTO HOUSE ARREST.
DO WE KNOW HOW HE IS DOING?
>> WELL, HE IS NOT IN ILL
HEALTH.
PEOPLE SAID HE WAS HOPEFUL HE
WOULD BE RELEASED TODAY.
HE WAS ANGRY AT SOME OF THE
CHARGES AND WITNESSES APPEARING
FROM NOWHERE TO ACCUSE HIM BUT
NO INDICATION HE IS IN BAD
HEALTH.
HE HAD BEEN WITH HIS WIFE UNDER
HOUSE ARREST AND FREE TO COME
AND GO.
SHE HAD BEEN HELD UNDER ARREST
AT THE BEGINNING.
HE IS IN GOOD HEALTH.
A NUMBER OF SUPPORTERS ALLOWED
INTO THE COURT TODAY.
CERTAINLY FOR ALL INVOLVED A
GOOD DAY.

FROM TURKEY WHERE PASTOR ANDREW
BRUNSON, IT APPEARS, WILL BE
RELEASED EVEN THOUGH HE WAS
