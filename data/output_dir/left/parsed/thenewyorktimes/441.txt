O.K. so now you're going to get 
a chance to see
what it feels like to be in 
one of these suits.
So first thing you're 
going to do
is throw on your 
battery pack.
It's going to make sure you
have good air circulation,
super important.
Next you're going to 
suit up.
All right now it's really 
important that you bring
lots of water and supplies
because now 
you're going to be hiking
through lava channels
for about three hours.
The HI-SEAS habitat is a
complex system.
We have over 100 electric
sensors that measure 
everything from temperature to
to solar radiation 
to water level.
When we may not get enough
charge from the solar panels,
we can make decisions like
whether or not we need to go
outside to start up the 
back up generator.
We don't have a lot of
communication 
with the outside world, so 
we're often on our own.
So Laura and I are going to 
take a sample of 
this lava flow here. From the 
sample we're going to take,
we're going to able to tell 
some things about  
the lava flow. So, something 
about its formational history
perhaps how quickly 
it cooled
maybe even the age 
of the lava flow.
So I'm here in the garden
at the habitat.
And you're sitting inside one
of the planter boxes. 
Here on Mars, fresh food
is a luxury.
When it comes to canned items,
we have plenty of it.
Creamy potato cheddar soup.
You guessed it, powder.
White chicken in a can,
cubes with powder.
The dried huevos, that's right,
powder.
The marshmallows!
These are real.
But that's basically all we 
got here to eat
here on Mars.
All our communication with 
mission support 
with our friends and family 
is through email.
And that email goes through
 a server that introduces 
a 20-minute delay 
on each email.
So if I want to send 
one exchange
with someone outside 
the hab,
it takes 40 minutes roundtrip.
