HONESTY AND SOME COMMITMENT TO
MEETING THE OBLIGATION OF
DISMANTLING THIS PROGRAM.
>> THANKS, DAVID.
LET'S GET TO RETIRED BRIGADIER
GENERAL, ANTHONY TATAU GOOD TO
SEE YOU THIS AFTERNOON.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR
THE MEETING TODAY GOING INTO THE
PLANNED SUMMIT?
>> WHAT SECRETARY POMPEO IS
DOING IS NEGOTIATING THE TERMS
THAT THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO
SEE FROM NORTH KOREA REGARDING
DENUCLEARIZATION.
BUT ALSO LAYING A ROAD MAP OUT
FOR WHAT -- YOU REMEMBER, HE
TALKED ABOUT NORTH KOREA BEING
ON PAR WITH SOUTH KOREA
EVENTUALLY ECONOMICALLY.
I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY THE
QUID PRO QUO HERE.
DENUCLEARIZATION LEADS TO
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY FOR NORTH
KOREA.
THAT'S A FAIR DEAL, A FAIR TRADE
AND WHETHER IT TAKES FIVE YEARS,
TEN YEARS, WHATEVER, THEY'RE THE
SAME PEOPLE.
I'VE BEEN OVER THERE, I'VE BE IN
THE DNZ,'S BEEN IN SOUTH KOREA.
I KNOW THE FAMILIES ARE SPLIT
THERE.
IT'S THE SAME WORK ETHIC, THE
SAME PEOPLE.
THERE'S NO REASON THAT NORTH
KOREA CAN'T PROSPER
ECONOMICALLY.
AND MEANTIME, YOU'VE GOT THE
LOGISTICS HAPPENING THAT POINT
TO A MEETING SOMEWHERE.
I MEAN, LOGISTICS IN THE DMZ AND
LOGISTICS IN SINGAPORE.
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WORKING VERY
HARD.
YOU KNOW, THE SUMMIT IS LARGELY
A SCRIPTED AFFAIR FOR THE MOST
PART.
SO YOU WANT TO HAVE EVERY DETAIL
IRONED OUT.
THAT'S WHAT SECRETARY POMPEO IS
DOING RIGHT NOW.
MAKING SURE THAT IT'S WORTH THE
PRESIDENT'S TIME TO FLY TO
WHEREVER HE'S FLYING.
>> SURE.
DO YOU THINK THAT KIM JONG-UN
WOULD AGREE TO COMPLETE
DISMANTLE, COMPLETELY
DENUCLEARIZE BEFORE THAT MEET
SOMETHING YOU HEARD DAVID LEE
MILLER SAYING THIS IS A LONG
PROCESS EVEN IF HE WERE TO AGREE
TO THAT?
>> I THINK HE WOULD.
THE TRADE OFF -- WE HAVE TO
REMEMBER IS THE BELIEF THAT KIM
JONG-UN WAS EDUCATED IN
SWITZERLAND, HE'S BEEN EXPOSED
TO THE WEST.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF
NORTH KOREA, HIS GRANDFATHER AND
FATHER CAME IN WITH ONE VISION,
WHICH IS VERY TYPICAL OF THIS
HERMIT KINGDOM.
THE GRANDFATHER'S VISION WAS A
SELF-RELIANT STATE.
KIM JONG-UN CAME IN WITH TWO
VISIONS.
ONE BEING A NUCLEAR POWER AND
THE OTHER BEING A ECONOMIC
POWER.
SO HE MAY BE WILLING TO TRADE
OFF THE NUCLEAR POWER TO BE AN
ECONOMIC POWER.
SO I THINK THIS IS PART OF HIS
PLAN TO GET TO WHERE HISTORIC
OPPORTUNITY HERE TO ACTUALLY
MAKE NORTH KOREA A VIABLE ENTITY
AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IT IS TODAY,
WHICH IS A BANKRUPT STATE.
>> YEAH.
YOU THINK THAT HAPPENS PRETTY
SOON INTO IT, ONCE WE KNOW THAT
THESE COUNTRIES HAVE AGREED TO
CERTAIN PRINCIPLES, YOU THINK
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BEGINS?
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE
BUILT.
THAT'S THE FIRST THING.
AIRPORTS AND PORTS AND ROADS AND
ALL OF THAT CONNECTING SMALL
TOWNS TO BIGGER CITIES AND
CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE
NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE AND THE
NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE
CORRUPTION THERE IT'S NOT SAYING
IT'S AN EASY ROAD TO TRAVEL.
IT'S A VIABLE ROAD.
ONE WHERE I THINK THERE'S A LOT
OF OPPORTUNITY INTERNATIONALLY
TO COME IN AND HELP BUILD OUT
NORTH KOREA SO THAT THEY CAN BE
THIS PROSPEROUS MEMBER OF THE
LEAGUE OF NATIONS SO TO SPEAK.
