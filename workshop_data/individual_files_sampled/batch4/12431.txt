isn't the other thing this show is now covering the news one day before it happens didn't yesterday didn't I tell you that they were gonna put forward the Republicans are gonna put forward some decent solutions and that Democrats are gonna say they will not do a Chuck Schumer essentially told his people do not sign on to anything that the demonstrated do because we want to keep the focus this was a quote from him apparently I don't think this were recorded but he said we want to keep the focus on Trump and then he showed up with this pin thing right because we all know in America the way laws are made it says in the Constitution the President shall use his pen to write laws because we do not want the legislation did he's offended that lawmakers should be taxed with making laws this is clearly a job for the legislature so here he is shaking his pen at the press there are so many obstacles to legislation and when the president can do it with his own pen it makes no sense Ryan the president signing it attaching it to things that are unacceptable legislation is not the way to go here when it's so easy for the president to sign it it's an excuse president can change it with his pen Ryan Trump unacceptable additions has bogged down every piece of immigration legislation we have done it's an excuse please don't throw at me without disputing the fact that this could be quicker if the president were to just sign something if if we're having this conversation in three weeks or six weeks I mean is when is there a point let's when is there a point the Democrats would be willing to work with Republicans say okay yes let's do some narrow fees let's hope we never get let's hope the president does the right thing and solves the problem which he can do that's the simple easiest and most likely way this will happen how many times has the immigration legislation passed in this Congress how many times zero it's an excuse by our Republican colleagues who feel the heat don't want to attack the president even though they know they know legislation we'll take a very long time and is unlikely to happen and the flick of a president's pen could solve this problem tomorrow Chuck Schumer begging Donald Trump to become king of America I mean how often do you see that what is it Trump because Trump has MSNBC reading the Bible and now he has Chuck Schumer begging him to be king what is the magic of it just gets these kits please be king Rick we can't pass laws we're just lawmakers how can we make laws we can't do it unbelievable
