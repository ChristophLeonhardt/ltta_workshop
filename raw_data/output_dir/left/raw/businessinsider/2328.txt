00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,320
partnering with them in June of 07 I

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,359
think one of the reasons behind that was

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,699
we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn more about what the</font>

8
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,040
studio perspective was and I think

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,149
they've really been at the forefront

10
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,649
there a number of their partnerships and

11
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,329
trying to expand distribution so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

which essentially opened up online

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,040
before it opened up on cable and so you

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,570
could stream movies<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're partners</font>

experiment in the space and test new

24

distribution platforms as soon as they

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,129
have what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overall perspective of</font>

26
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,619
online video from studios and networks I

27

think generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're very scared</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about it as you know they probably</font>

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,750
increasingly has gotten more open

originally had three networks we were

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,900
talking other day about how the nightly

36
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,700
their world has changed so dramatically

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,369
and that fragmentation has created new

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunities to distribute content</font>

39
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,460
which excites them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately</font>

40
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,810
each of those new avenues seems to be

41
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,790
less profitable than the avenues they

42

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,920
certainly play well and we got a

if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at one screen and that</font>

more long-form type content and are the

right you guys last year bought HBO labs

73
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,180
was their experimental online video

74
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,680
presents who's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen as a big</font>

75
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,050
failure in the industry or I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

76
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">certainly it's been remarkable for us</font>

77
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,660
that we were motivated to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the deal</font>

78
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,040
because we were having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great success</font>

79
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,569
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> our original content efforts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

80
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,310
particular on the branded content side

81
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,459
we'd seen a tremendous uptake from our

82
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,690
advertisers and the products<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

83
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,700
offering their I think what HBO saw was

84
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,500
they were having great success creating

85
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,600
compelling content but HBO is not a

86
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,890
sales company they don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

87
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,269
sales force<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's under their charter</font>

88
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:58,920
they're not allowed to sell ads and they

89
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,180
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that content get more</font>

90
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,190
widely distributed and monetized and so

91
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,989
we're in LA we were a perfect partner

92
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,150
for it you bought it outright yeah we

93
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">bought it outright although they still</font>

94
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,360
have legacy rights some of the content

95
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,340
creator<font color="#CCCCCC"> Corey's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up and the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

96
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,959
shows are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you looking for similar</font>

97
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,940
content or acquisitions<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we're always</font>

98
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,040
keeping our eyes open for anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

99
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,739
seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like fitting for either our</font>

100
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,150
audience segments which is young guys or

101
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,100
can expand our either content we create

102
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,329
in the video<font color="#CCCCCC"> segment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or the distribution</font>

103
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,220
we have so we're actively looking we've

104
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,410
got a team that is out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

105
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,380
been tough to find deals just everyone's

106
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,570
expectations are too high<font color="#CCCCCC"> so prime time</font>

107
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,420
is now not you know eight to ten it's

108
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,519
now noon to what everybody's on their

109
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,019
lunch break how are you guys

110
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,670
capitalizing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does that</font>

111
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean from networks and studios I think</font>

112
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,720
you know our approach has always been I

113
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">think one of the reasons we've been</font>

114
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,900
successful across our sites as we you

115
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,459
know we stick to schedules and we stick

116
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,530
to frequent content updates and I think

117
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,359
the way we capitalize<font color="#CCCCCC"> out is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

118
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,160
capitalize on that is if you're our

119
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,780
average person and we know you're going

120
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come to us at specific hours we need</font>

121
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,780
to make sure there's refresh content on

122
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,280
there as much as possible during that

123
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,380
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> frame increasingly what's</font>

124
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,780
interesting is on the advertiser side

125
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,459
we're starting more and more to target

126
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,470
day parts in advertising I think one of

127
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">those exciting developments in the</font>

128
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,139
advertising front will be seeing how

129
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,459
that happens so you'll start seeing

130
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">chilis ads for example around lunchtime</font>

131
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,600
something that already happens

132
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,250
effectively on television but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we haven't</font>

133
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">really seen yet too much on the internet</font>

134
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,800
I think we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start seeing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

135
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,550
lot more that's

136
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,020
but from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a content and an advertising</font>

137
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,240
standpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying to migrate to</font>

138
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,069
that model as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well in certain cases now</font>

139
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,940
on content for the the legacy or

140
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,180
incumbent studios and networks are any

141
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,590
of them doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything forward-thinking</font>

142
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,580
or experimental online I think they've

143
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,800
all had their bits and pieces where

144
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,030
they've tried stuff and I think Fox

145
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,979
still has a studio internally that is

146
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,379
about it is devoted to testing and

147
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:51,360
piloting concepts I think the individual

148
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,590
show runners on the networks are

149
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,090
increasingly building it into their

150
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,830
shows I think the guys who run how i met

00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,940
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mother seem to be doing it really</font>

00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">effectively it's a show on CBS and they</font>

153
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,810
frequently build in web concepts

154
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,849
properties and jokes into the show and

155
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,860
then build up existing web presences for

those<font color="#E5E5E5"> already so they'll mention</font>

something on the show<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then be a</font>

networks and studios themselves have

are actually finding ways they can

the partnership or collaboration between

the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of</font>

169
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,460
going to be a trial and error to see

170

what happens or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to combine</font>

into one<font color="#E5E5E5"> are your your predictions yeah</font>

172
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,270
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two year time frame I think what</font>

173
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,310
happens is the networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> studios</font>

continue to source content and ideas

175
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:42,690
from the internet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a testing</font>

176
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,250
ground I don't know if they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

177
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,870
make their own and test it there but

178
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly they're going to look for</font>

179
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,080
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and leverage that</font>

180
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,210
to make books TV shows movies

181
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,949
potentially and that's sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font>

182
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:54,599
they've been doing very slowly over the

183
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">last few years i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that pace is</font>

184
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:58,110
accelerating things can catch the

185
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,580
zeitgeist very quickly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

186

translate into other platforms<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

187
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:04,830
in a longer time horizon what you're

188
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing is the budgets that guys like us</font>

189
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:09,690
have for creating content and monetizing

190
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,520
our properties continue to go up and up

191
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,889
a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago if we spent twenty-five</font>

192
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:16,289
dollars on a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be a huge</font>

193
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:18,389
budget for us and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we spent thousands</font>

194
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:20,159
of dollars for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one-minute video which</font>

195
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,569
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too different than digital cable</font>

196
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:24,569
and as our monetization and distribution

197
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,120
capabilities continue to improve I think

198
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,949
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see us looking for ways we can</font>

199
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:31,110
expand on our own<font color="#CCCCCC"> properties and us</font>

200
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,909
searching the web to capitalize so the

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:33,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">next few years is definitely an</font>

202
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,389
incumbent advantage by those players but

203
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:36,870
I think in

204
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,400
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> time frame we're all basically</font>
