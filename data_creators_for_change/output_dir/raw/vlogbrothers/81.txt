00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
Good morning John

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,320
Wow! That's what my voice sounds like.

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,640
(Imitating Don LaFontaine) In a world...

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,960
...Where a guy...

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,460
...Has to make a video blog even though he was up quite late

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,820
and then his baby was up quite early...

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,360
(Normal voice) He makes a video blog.

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,640
Earlier this week, Lauren Lapkus, uh, 
tweeted the following:

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,600
"Older siblings are the original influencers. When I was little,

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,420
my brother said sausage pizza was gross and I didn't eat it again for 20 years."

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,613
Which was apparently,

12
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:28,680
'hashtag relatable' for a lot of people, including me.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,160
I quote-tweeted this, and I said,

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,760
"My older brother thought that it was a good idea to make video blogs!"

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,380
and,

16
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,180
Like, I wanna emphasize that that's not an exaggeration.

17
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,080
There's this thing about older siblings,

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,180
and I don't know if this is always the case, but it seems—

19
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,900
—Lauren's tweet and my experience combined—Like, there's something about this relationship

20
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,260
that creates this absolute clarity and confidence

21
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,520
in the correctness of, like, the taste-making ability

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,680
of this child. And it's kind of a remarkable responsibility for a child to have.

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,220
I don't expect children to live up to this responsibility.

24
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,160
Of course, sometimes your older sibling is into super weird or dumb stuff, like smoking cigarettes

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,340
and reading Ulysses for fun

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,420
John, for the most part, and especially when it comes to music—which, I find

27
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,720
this weird, 'cause you're not... particularly musical.

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,360
That's okay to say, I think—

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,420
You have extremely good taste in music.

30
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,280
Like, all of the bands you have gotten me into over the years

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,640
have been way better than, like, what would be sort of a random selection.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,060
I can literally remember the first time that you and Matt Brown brought

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,660
Flood, the They Might Be Giants album, into the house and put it in Dad's, like,

34
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,340
giganto CD player. But, like, if that had been a

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,200
Chumbawumba CD, I probably

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,300
would have learned every word to every song in the album,

37
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,200
and I would have like, plumbed the depths of Chumbawumba's

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,220
backlog of stuff—I don't know if that exists.

39
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,320
I don't know anything, maybe Chumbawumba's great.

40
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,260
I apologize to Chumbawumba fans and also to Chumbawumba.

41
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,660
But my sense is that I probably wouldn't have been able to

42
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,920
cultivate like a decades-long love affair

43
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,315
with Chumbawumba if that's what you'd brought into my life.

44
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:06,755
I'm in Portland, Oregon right now,

45
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,400
where I have traveled with my wife and child to go see

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,835
probably the 12th They Might Be Giants show of my life. For those who don't know,

47
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,600
They Might Be Giants is a weird, artsy, nerdy

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,620
rock band with generally opaque

49
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,800
but like, still meaningful lyrics, and the musical style

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,720
that is somehow extremely cohesive without hardly

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,500
ever sounding like itself. So part of me thinks

52
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:30,645
that I am super into They Might Be Giants because it's what

53
00:02:30,645 --> 00:02:33,685
nerdy guys my age are supposed to be into? Like it's just

54
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:36,695
sort of the thing that happens to people like me?

55
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,060
But I'm honestly more interested in listening to my gut here,

56
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,760
and my gut tells me that there's something good about this band!

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,440
And the more and deeper I listen to any song or album,

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,600
I just keep finding layers of interestingness there.

59
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,720
It gives me this music with the goal of

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,640
like, creating something simple to enjoy that

61
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,040
has a lot of complexity within it. And they are

62
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,280
still releasing new, very good albums.

63
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,920
They're in their late fifties, and I'm sure financially stable,

64
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,300
but they're still learning new instruments, and

65
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,100
creating new ways of doing the thing that they do,

66
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,080
still touring, still making people happy.

67
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,880
There's something in it that lacks pretension, that leans into

68
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,700
enthusiasm and effort,

69
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,400
that's kinda—maybe infected my entire life?

70
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,700
And that infection started with something you brought into our house.

71
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,160
I think the self-awareness and honesty of this music and the

72
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,500
persona of this band is what gives it such longevity.

73
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,740
It was never trying to be anything but what it was,

74
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,820
but it was always trying to be interesting and good, which has allowed

75
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,520
it to be a lifelong gift for me to enjoy.

76
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,080
And also to be inspired by.

77
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,000
I know that you didn't know, that you were giving me that, but thank you anyway.

78
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,000
I wish everyone was so lucky to have such good

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,080
and nerdy tastemakers in their lives when they were growing up.

80
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,720
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.

81
00:03:52,760 --> 00:00:00,000
(clapping and drumbeat, crowd singing to Chumbawumba's "Tubthumping")
