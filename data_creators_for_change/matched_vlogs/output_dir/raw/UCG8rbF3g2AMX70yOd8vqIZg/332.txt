00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,780

No, your name is Jeff!

33
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,660
By the way, you've never met Kong. What do you think, bro?

34
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,380

38
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,239
Hey, was it a dumb idea for me to get a dog, bro?

39
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:04,739
No!

40
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,700

42
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,960
Okay!

43
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,020
It's making waves on the internet

44
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,260
Ya, you're right, you're right, you're right.

45
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,180
You've been with Maverick. You've been feeding Maverick.

46
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,520
How does he feel about Young Kong Doggy the savage?

47
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,800
It's probably gonna take a little bit of time to Mav to get used to it.

48
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,620
Is Mav pissed?

49
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,660
He's definitely pissed!

50
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,380
Nooooo!

51
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,260
Maverick I know you watch my vlogs, do not worry.

52
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,280
Kong is your friend, not your enemy. Okay?

53
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,400
Look at this little guy

Alligator

68
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,620
Bro, I wrestled a f*cking alligator!

69
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,780
So here's why Jeff said it was national hug day: These guys are giving free hugs!

70
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,800

88
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,640
Yes, like the show I get to cook some probably very horrible meals and have them judge

89
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,120
I can't cook for sh*t

90
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
