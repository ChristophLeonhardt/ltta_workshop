1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,120
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYERS IN
IOWA ARE UNDER FIRE AFTER

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,600
THEY DECIDED TO BURN A CROSS
WHILE WEARING KKK GARB AND

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,030
PROCEEDED TO POST ABOUT
IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,189
THOSE ARE FIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO
ARE PART OF A SMALL TOWN

5
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:20,949
FOOTBALL TEAM IN CRESTON, IOWA,
AND THEY ARE AT CRESTON

6
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:22,439
HIGH SCHOOL.

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,289
THIS DEBATE HAS EMERGED
REGARDING WHAT RIGHTS

8
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,699
ADMINISTRATORS HAVE TO PUNISH OR
MAKE THE STUDENTS

9
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,698
PAY CONSEQUENCES.

10
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,469
THEY HAVE BEEN BOOTED FROM THE
FOOTBALL TEAM SO THAT HAS ALREADY

11
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,930
HAPPENED BUT SOME ARE
QUESTIONING WHETHER OR NOT THERE

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,120
ARE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS
FOR THE STUDENTS HERE.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,760
ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS, THE FIRST
AMENDMENT HAS EVEN MORE

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,879
LIMITATIONS.

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,850
IF THE BEHAVIOR OR THE SPEECH OF
A PARTICULAR STUDENT IS A

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,219
DISTRACTION AND IS DISTRACTING
OTHER STUDENTS FROM A SOUND

17
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:56,370
EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT,
ADMINISTRATORS CAN TAKE

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,679
MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS SO
THERE ARE EVEN MORE LIMITS

19
00:00:58,679 --> 00:00:59,679
ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS.

20
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,769
HOWEVER, IN THIS CASE, THIS DID
NOT HAPPEN ON THE SCHOOL

21
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:06,710
CAMPUS AND THEY ALSO DIDN'T
TARGET A SPECIFIC STUDENT,

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,159
SO THE ABILITY FOR THE
ADMINISTRATORS TO PASS DOWN ANY

23
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,520
SORT OF PUNISHMENT IS INCREDIBLY
LIMITED, ACCORDING TO SOME.

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:27,630
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,130
HERE ARE THE ARGUMENTS IN TERMS
OF WHAT ADMINISTRATORS CAN DO

26
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,579
IN TERMS OF PUNISHMENT.

27
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:48,469
THERE 
IS 

28
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:52,149
PRECEDENT REGARDING
INCIDENTS LIKE THIS.

29
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:56,299
NOT NECESSARILY RACIAL ISSUES,
BUT THINGS WERE STUDENTS HAVE

30
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,719
DONE SOMETHING QUESTIONABLE,
ADMINISTRATORS WANTED TO

31
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,189
TAKE ACTION AND IN THAT SUPREME
COURT RULED ON IT.

32
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:23,290
LIMIT GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLES.

33
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,360
SO IF IT IS A DIRECT THREAT.

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,260
IF THEY ARE TARGETING A SPECIFIC
INDIVIDUAL, THERE IS A CASE TO

35
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,900
BE MADE THAT ADMINISTRATORS
CAN'T ALLOW SOME SORT OF

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,900
PUNISHMENT.

37
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,090
HOWEVER, IF IT IS JUST A
POLITICAL STATEMENT WHICH

38
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,040
IN THIS CASE, THE ARGUMENT IS
THAT THEY ARE MAKING A

39
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,849
POLITICAL STATEMENT EVEN
THOUGH IT IS DISGUSTING, THEN

40
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:46,640
ADMINISTERS CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,080
THOUGHTS?

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,370
DEFINITELY OFF THE FOOTBALL
TEAM.

43
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,831
I GET IT.

44
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:56,040
THEY HAVE BLACK FOOTBALL
TEAMMATES.

45
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,410
AND THIS IS NOT AN AMBIGUOUS
SYMBOL.

46
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,160
THE WEARING OF A DASH THEY TALK
ABOUT THE AMBIGUITY AS TO

47
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,070
WHETHER IT IS DIRECTED TO ANY
INDIVIDUAL, BUT THERE IS NOTHING

48
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,080
LESS AMBIGUOUS AND WEARING A
HOOD LIKE THIS AND BURNING A

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,940
CROSS.

50
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,379
I DON'T KNOW, I WOULD STAY
WITHIN THE LEGAL BOUNDS OF

51
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,489
WHATEVER THE SCHOOL BOARD CAN OR
CAN'T DO.

52
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:21,980
I WOULD GO TO THE FURTHEST
EXTENT AND GETTING THEM OFF

53
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,269
THE FOOTBALL TEAM IS A GOOD
START, BUT THIS IS NOT A

54
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:28,220
SUN RISING OR A SUNSETTING, YOU
MAKE THE CALL.

55
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,519
THIS HE THESE ARE DASH THIS IS
LIKE THE NAME ADOLF, A

56
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,099
SWASTIKA, THESE ARE VERY CLEAR
INDICATORS THAT YOU ARE

57
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:40,230
AFFILIATING YOURSELF WITH THE
HAY GROUP AND BY THAT

58
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,060
DEFINITION, I WOULD GO AS FAR AS
POSSIBLE.

59
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,950
I AM STRUCK BY THE, ONE OF THOSE
DECISIONS THAT YOU MENTIONED

60
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,500
WHERE A TEENAGER BURNED ACROSS
ON THE LAWN OF AN

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,340
AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILY AND THEY
OVERTURNED THE CONVICTION BUT

62
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,340
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

63
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,640
THERE IS NO LEGAL REMEDY?

64
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,670
THERE'S NO CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT
THAT YOU CAN BRING AGAINST

65
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,670
THAT PERSON?

66
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,960
I THINK YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

67
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,310
I REALLY WANT TO LOOK INTO
THE DETAILS OF THAT RULING

68
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,579
BECAUSE BASED ON WHAT I KNOW
RIGHT NOW, IT JUST DOESN'T

69
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:14,829
MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.

70
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:17,750
NO TRESPASS DATING OR
LANDSCAPE VANDALISM?

71
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,180
IT'S A PRIVATE PROPERTY YOU
CAN AT LEAST MAKE THE CASE

72
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,130
IT WAS TRESPASSING.

73
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,500
CAN YOU IMAGINE SOMEONE BURNING
A CROSS ON YOUR FRONT LAWN

74
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,540
AND THEN THE SUPREME COURT
OVERTURNING A CONVICTION?

75
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,670
THAT'S INSANE BUT I WILL LOOK
INTO THAT.

76
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:43,760
LOOK, I DO AGREE THAT THE
ADMINISTRATORS POWER IS LIMITED

77
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,710
IN THIS CASE BECAUSE IT HAPPENED
WHEN CLASS WAS NOT IN SESSION.

78
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:55,000
IT DID NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE
SCHOOL CAMPUS AND THIS

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
DOESN'T JUST HAVE TO DO WITH
RACIAL ISSUES.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,410
THIS ISSUE COMES UP A LOT WHEN
IT COMES UP TO BULLYING.

81
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:06,670
EITHER ONLINE, OR AFTER SCHOOL
HOURS.

82
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,310
WHAT CAN ADMINISTRATORS DO TO
PUNISH THOSE WHO ARE

83
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,690
BULLYING OTHER STUDENTS?

84
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,410
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING
TO PLAY OUT.

85
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,920
PRESIDENT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,610
AND IT IS ALSO HOW LIBERAL I
AM GOING TO BE I GUESS FOR

87
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,320
LACK OF A BETTER WORD, ON THE
ONE HAND PART OF ME IS LIKE

88
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,450
YOU ARE OFF THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

89
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,730
YOU ARE EXPELLED FROM THE
SCHOOL.

90
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,500
THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR
THAT WE THINK IS BE BIDDING

91
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,540
OF THE PEOPLE WHO ATTEND HERE SO
WERE GOING TO PUT SEVERE AT

92
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,770
LEAST EXTENDED SUSPICIONS ON YOU
BECAUSE THIS DOES SEEM LIKE

93
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,650
THE KIND OF THING THAT KIDS DO
FOR ATTENTION PROBABLY AND

94
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,650
IT IS STUPID.

95
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:48,520
IT IS MISGUIDED AND I THINK THEY
NEED TO SUFFER CONSEQUENCES OR

96
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,040
THERE IS NO REASON TO HAVE A
SCHOOL IN THE FIRST PLACE

97
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,650
BECAUSE WE ARE TEACHING KIDS
THINGS AND WE CAN'T REINFORCE

98
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,750
THIS AND WE NEED TO FIND A WAY
SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT WHAT THEY

99
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,300
DID IS BAD.

100
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,520
ANOTHER THING, IT'S LIKE MORE OF
AN EDUCATIONAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL

101
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:11,120
PSYCHOLOGY THING IS WHEN YOU
READ UP ON KIDS TO GET OUT INTO

102
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,800
WEIRD LITTLE SUBCULTURES LIKE
WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS, I'VE

103
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,240
READ A COUPLE OF BOOKS ON THIS
AND A LOT OF THEM POINT TO

104
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,500
HAVING A COMMUNITY.

105
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,540
IT IS LIKE A GANG.

106
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,270
IT IS GANG BEHAVIOR,
TERRORIST BEHAVIOR IN DIFFERENT

107
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:32,550
PARTS OF THE WORLD, BUT FOR THE
TEENAGENESS ITSELF IS A

108
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,050
CONSTRUCT INVENTED BY AMERICANS
IN THE 1950S BUT TO HAVE A

109
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,480
COMMUNITY THAT DOESN'T REINFORCE
THE BEHAVIOR OF WHITE SUPREMACY,

110
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,820
THE TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF THAT IS
A FOOTBALL TEAM WERE PEOPLE OF

111
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,730
ALL DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS HAVE
TO COME TOGETHER AND WORK

112
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,680
TOGETHER BUT IT DEPENDS ON HOW
GOOD THE COACH IS AT MAKING

113
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,270
THAT HAPPEN, SITTING THESE KIDS
DOWN TOGETHER AND SAYING

114
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,520
LISTEN, THIS IS NOT GOING TO
FLY.

115
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,070
I THINK THAT IS AFTER SOME VERY
CONCRETE PUNISHMENT THAT IS

116
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,970
COMES INTO PLAY.

117
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,240
UNLESS THERE IS MASSIVE PUSHBACK
FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THE

118
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,920
SCHOOL BOARD AND THE FOOTBALL
TEAM AND EVERYONE THAT THEY

119
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,320
COME INTO CONTACT WITH THAT THIS
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND THIS

120
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
IS NOT OKAY.

121
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,760
SO THIS DIDN'T TAKE PLACE ON
CAMPUS DURING SCHOOL HOURS

122
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,160
AS YOU GUYS MENTIONED.

123
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,820
SO THEY WONDER HOW MUCH ONE CAN
DO BUT IF YOU THINK THESE

124
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,540
GUYS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN
THIS KIND OF ACTION WHEN

125
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,390
THEY ARE NOT A SCHOOL IF IT
ISN'T BEING DISCUSSED,

126
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,100
TALKED ABOUT, IMPLEMENTED,
HAPPENING IN THE REST OF

127
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,960
THEIR LIFE, YOU'RE CRAZY.

128
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,420
THIS IS WHERE THE PERCEPTION ñ
THERE WAS THE GUY WHO

129
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,100
MURDERED A COUPLE OF BLACK GUYS
IN BATON ROUGE AND ONE OF

130
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,880
THE HEADLINES SAYS A CLEAN-CUT
AMERICAN DAD DOES THIS.

131
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,840
AND PEOPLE LIKE HOW CAN THIS
HAPPEN?

132
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,270
BECAUSE IT'S WITHIN THE
COMMUNITY, IT'S IN HIS

133
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,850
MINDSET, IT IS WHO HE IS.

134
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,960
THAT PERCEPTION OF THIS IS
JUST A WHITE GUY WHO MADE A

135
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,090
MISTAKE AND HE HAD SOME YOUTHFUL
EXUBERANCE AND ALL THAT, IT

136
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,090
IS ACTUALLY REAL.

137
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,370
LET'S
THINK ABOUT THIS, THERE'S A

138
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,180
LATINO OR BLACK GANG - GUYS IN
GANGS AND GO TO SCHOOL.

139
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,290
WE KNOW THERE ARE METAL
DETECTORS AT SCHOOLS AND

140
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,410
BAD COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY
THINK THEY ARE GOING TO

141
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,710
BRING THE STUFF INTO THE SCHOOL.

142
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,840
HOW DO WE NOT THINK THAT THIS
GANG IS GOING TO BRING

143
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,710
THEIR STUFF INTO THE SCHOOL?

144
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,560
THEY START BANNING THESE GANG
MEMBERS FROM COMING INTO SCHOOLS

145
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,050
ARE MAKING SURE THEY DON'T BRING
THEIR STUFF INTO THAT SCHOOL.

146
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,690
WE HAVE TO SEE THE SAME WAY.

147
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,150
WE ARE AFRAID OF THOSE MINORITY
GANGS BUT WHY ARE WE AFRAID

148
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,650
OF THIS GANG WHO HAS A VERY LONG
HISTORY OF DOING THINGS TO

149
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,650
HARM PEOPLE.

150
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,850
IF ANYTHING, IT IS TO PROTECT
YOUR SCHOOL.

151
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,409
IT IS JUST A PERCEPTION OF THESE
KIND OF GUYS, THEY'RE BAD

152
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:40,610
GUYS AND THEY CAN HURT PEOPLE,
BUT THEY ARE NOT THAT BAD.

153
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,560
IT IS JUST AN AFTERSCHOOL
ACTIVITY RATHER THAN THEIR LIFE.

154
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,120
SO WHAT IS THE SOLUTION?

155
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,960
IS THERE A REHABILITATING?

156
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,920
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY, HOW
LIBERAL AM I?

157
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,620
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A PLACE IF I'M
JUST GOING TO SAY, LET'S TAKE

158
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,840
THE GANG MEMBER, THE WHITE KID,
LET'S MAKE THEM BETTER THROUGH

159
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
SCHOOL.

160
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
YOU KNOW?

161
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,570
FIRST SEEING EVERYBODY GETTING A
PUNISHMENT.

162
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,090
IN THE COMMUNITY.

163
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,210
IT'S LIKE WITH OUR SOCIETY IN
GENERAL.

164
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,210
HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT?

165
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,340
THERE ARE BAD APPLES IN THE
POLICE DEPARTMENT BUT

166
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,280
REALLY THAT ENDS UP DESTROYING
ALL OF THE PEOPLE BECAUSE

167
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,680
THEY STARTED PROTECTING EACH
OTHER.

168
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,810
HOW DO YOU CHANGE THE MINDSET OF
A SOCIETY?

169
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,720
BECAUSE POLICE OFFICERS AS I'VE
SAID BEFORE JUST MEMBERS OF

170
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:35,930
SOCIETY WHO CAN SHE GIVE FOR THE
JOB.

171
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,810
I HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT.

172
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,650
BY THE WAY, I WANT TO BE CLEAR
ABOUT SOMETHING BECAUSE

173
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,990
THERE IS WHAT I WOULD WANT TO
DO, AND THEN THERE'S WHAT

174
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,150
THE LAW WOULD ALLOW ME TO DO.

175
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,250
IF I JUST ACTED BASED ON MY OWN
INSTINCT AND DID WHAT I

176
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,840
WANTED TO DO AND IGNORE THE LAW,
THEY ARE OUT.

177
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,380
THERE COMPLETELY OUT.

178
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,360
BUT I'M SIMPLY JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT KIND OF PROTECTIONS

179
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,680
THE STUDENTS HAVE WHICH BY THE
WAY, I'M VERY CURIOUS IF

180
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,610
SIMILAR PROTECTIONS WOULD BE
EXTENDED.

181
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,510
WOULD WE HAVE THIS KIND OF
DEBATE AND I THINK THIS GOES TO

182
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,780
YOUR POINT, JAYAR, WHEN WE HAVE
THIS KIND OF DEBATE IF WE HAD A

183
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:17,460
GROUP OF BLACK KIDS FROM THIS
HIGH SCHOOL GETTING TOGETHER AND

184
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,230
TALKING ABOUT, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW.

185
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,860
DOING SOMETHING THAT'S PERCEIVED
AS RACIST TOWARDS WHITE

186
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,860
STUDENTS?

187
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,950
THAT WOULD BE A NATIONAL STORY
THAT PEOPLE WOULD NOT STOP

188
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,950
TALKING ABOUT.

189
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,750
THIS HAPPENED A MONTH AGO AND
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT

190
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,320
OCCURRED I DIDN'T EVEN GET ANY
COVERAGE UNTIL NOW.

191
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,800
SO ANYWAY, THE POINT THAT I
WANTED TO MAKE -

192
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,140
IT LOOK SO RIDICULOUS IS WHAT I
THINK IT IS.

193
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,260
THEY DO LOOK RIDICULOUS AND
WHETHER THEY WANTED THIS

194
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,500
FOR ATTENTION OR WHETHER THEY
ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN WHAT

195
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,110
THEY'RE DOING, THAT DOESN'T
MATTER.

196
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,820
WHAT DOES MATTER IN MY EYES IS
EDUCATION BECAUSE EDUCATION

197
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,320
IS WHAT HOPEFULLY WILL WEED
OUT THIS TYPE OF IGNORANCE

198
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,910
BECAUSE THE STEMS FROM
IGNORANCE.

199
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,100
ITSES INSENSITIVITY TO A REALLY
DARK TIME IN AMERICA THAT

200
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,080
UNFORTUNATELY IS NOW
EXPERIENCING A REEMERGENCE

201
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,090
BUT IF I WERE AN EDUCATOR ON
THAT CAMPUS AND I FOUND OUT THAT

202
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,310
THE STUDENTS ARE DOING THIS, OH,
OKAY, I'M GOING TO EMPHASIZE

203
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,820
CERTAIN THINGS IN MY CURRICULUM
FOR THE REST OF THE SEMESTER.

204
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
IF YOU THINK THIS IS CUTE AND
YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY,

205
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,110
LET'S HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT
LYNCHINGS.

206
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,740
A REAL DISCUSSION ABOUT
AMERICA'S HISTORY BECAUSE

207
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,360
THE FUNNY THING IS,
CONSERVATIVES ARGUE THAT

208
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,650
LIBERAL INDOCTRINATION ON SCHOOL
CAMPUSES.

209
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:39,470
REALLY, BECAUSE OF THEIR WERE
LIBERAL INDOCTRINATION AND

210
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,410
THESE LIBERAL EDUCATORS WERE AS
EFFECTIVE AS YOU THINK THEY

211
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,340
WERE, DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WOULD
THINK THIS IS A JOKE?

212
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,370
IF ANYTHING, I THINK THAT WE
HAVE MOVED SO FAR BEHIND

213
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:56,200
EFFECTIVE HISTORY EDUCATION,
SOCIAL STUDIES EDUCATION.

214
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,730
IT IS DEVASTATING.

215
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,850
THESE KIDS DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE DOING.

216
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,250
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
DOING.

217
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,370
BUT THEY SHOULD.

218
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,490
THAT'S THE THING.

219
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,490
LET'S HAVE A REFRESHER.

220
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,100
AN ACTUAL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED DURING THE CIVIL WAR.

221
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,490
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SHARING MY
OPINION.

222
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,330
WHO CARES ABOUT MY OPINION?

223
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,040
LET'S TALK ABOUT ACTUAL FACTS.

224
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,770
WHAT THIS COUNTRY WENT THERE
BECAUSE I GUESS A LOT OF

225
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,910
PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN.

226
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,950
IT JUST GOES BACK TO THE
UNAMBIGUOUS, THE LACK OF

227
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:28,270
AMBIGUITY OF HOODS AND BURNING
CROSSES.

228
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,270
I GET IT.

229
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,470
I GET THE FRUSTRATION.

230
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,420
YOU WANT TO MAKE A DISTINCTION
BETWEEN GANG MEMBERS AND A CLAN?

231
00:12:36,420 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S THE SAME WORD.
