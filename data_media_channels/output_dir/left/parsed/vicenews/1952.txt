we're in the wetlands of southern
Louisiana and this place is a site of
one of the worst environmental
catastrophes made by man right now we
are losing a football field where the
wetlands every hour it is a vital part
of our natural storm defense system
every place on the coast where the oil
and gas industry went in the landfill
apart what a loud Katrina in accounting
in was that none of that got blocked
because there's all open water down my
daddy says the oil field started it and
mother nature's finishing
you
