joining me now to break this down contributor to The Daily wire Alecia Kraus Alicia good to see you yeah you too thank you all right Alicia the story is quite crazy I mean this is not a paltry sum of money this is totaling hundreds of millions of dollars been going on in a sense right under our nose it's right under the nose of the government in Minnesota I mean let's go first to this whistleblower when he made this report why wasn't this investigated it's unbelievable I mean it's a hundred million dollars in 2017 alone that they think was fraudulently stolen from the people and the taxpayers of Minnesota there it is mind-boggling that that much money would go to just ten day care centers number one number two the fact that this was how did the FBI miss this how come the whistleblowers emails weren't paid attention to and and I think really it is political much like the Flint water crisis and other issues that we've seen on statewide levels and federal levels even that things you know well because it's not politically it correct to you need to target these Somali immigrants maybe we shouldn't pay attention to the emails at this whistleblower sent because they happen to come from you know middle-aged white dude unfortunately this happens a lot at government it happened under the Obama administration and it looks that it's still systemic and happening even under the Trump administration right it's so insulting to ignore abuse to ignore fraudulent activity because of someone's skin color or because of the skin color of the person that reported it skin color has nothing to do with this race has nothing to do with this this is a potential criminal activity here defrauding like you said the people of Minnesota who work hard pay taxes that's money that's taken out of their paycheck every single week and it's being defrauded it's being stolen from Alicia how did these daycare centers these ten daycare centers how did they actually pull this off it looks as if they were working really with compliance of a lot of the parents that were involved so there's gonna be tons of levels of investigation here I think of first the Department of Health and Human Services there needs to look into how they're spending their money and how the approval process is because the approval process in states like Michigan Oklahoma and California typically means if you're gonna be taking money from the state for a single moms daycare right like the mom is allotted a certain amount of money that she can spend at state approved daycare centers that annually if not even quarterly in some places you have an agent on behalf of the state going and check out these things well here's 10 daycare centers that either did a really good job covering things up when those agents came in or maybe the owed agents are also complicit or they just didn't know what to look for here and and let's go back to even if none of this money ended up going to terrorists which it is incredibly awful that it looks like it might have according to the FBI at this point this hundreds over a hundred million dollars that was fraudulently stolen this is a massive crime and a massive undertaking so you're gonna have the mastermind you're gonna have a failure by the state government you're gonna have the complicit you know behavior of the parents that would bring their kids and then take them home like ten minutes later there's so many intricate details and numbers here it's gonna take a lot of you know cut forensic gathering to determine who was the mastermind and how did they get away with this for so very long right that was my question literally details how did they pull this off I mean it's so incredible reports are saying the parents would go to these daycare centers they've checked their kids in and then like you said ten minutes later they'd leave with the child with the daycare center wouldn't check the child out they wouldn't mark that the child had left till the end of the day and this wasn't just a few parents doing it while the daycare was still up and running this would be everyone who got went into the daycare so the daycare would build the state for a full day of taken care of you know innumerable children when there was nobody in the daycare center whatsoever none it's unbelievable you think just one cursory investigation one cursory state agent going to check this out would have noticed that these were empty buildings that nobody would say bugling yeah it didn't it is I mean it's terrible oversight it'll be interesting to watch this unfold talk to me about the aspect though I mean the owners of these daycare centers our Somali immigrants all ten of them that's where some of the allegations that oh perhaps this money that's being sent back to Somalia a corrupt country overrun by terrorists maybe some of that money is being skimmed by terror organizations who take a cut of any money that's sent back to that country Alicia that seems to be a realistic allegation when you're talking about sending money to that nation well and it's not a conspiracy theory because now we have reports from local law enforcement that they did indeed work find people that were traveling from Minneapolis st. Paul International Airport that had connections to these Somali daycare run Somali run daycare centers that were then taking suitcases of cash which yes of course you can travel with cash in the United States but usually you have to declare it when you're traveling internationally and I think the limit is even $5,000 in goods and services that you're able to travel with domestically and internationally you'd have to double check me on that and so the law enforcement found out once they figured out the shady scheme that that money was leaving the text Minnesota taxpayer dollars was leaving the state via st. Paul Minneapolis st. Paul International Airport and headed on flights directly to Somalia I mean if that ain't Shady and if that ain't suspicious activity going to fund terrorists that this the whistleblower said he said I was afraid that it was potentially gonna hurt not only innocence in of the United States but innocence in other countries and maybe even our American military and that's why he felt the need to send these multiple emails that apparently went ignored right it's diabolical I mean I i'd like an investigation to into what the governor of minnesota knew he says he doesn't know he said he didn't know anything but it sounds to me like he may just be covering his butt here because there are reports that say people in his office were notified of what happened and still no action was taken Alysha congressman keith Ellison obviously this is his district he commented on this he actually came out very strongly against I mean he didn't call out this welfare fraud he's defending it this is his statement he said Fox 9's recent story is poorly reported presenting a single out-of-state source to attempt to link domestic fraud cases with the lawful transfer by Somali Americans of their hard-earned funds to family and friends abroad it plays to the worst stereotypes about an important Minnesota community I'm proud to represent he said one of the largest Somali diaspora communities in the world my constituents work tirelessly to support their communities both here and in Somalia he goes on for a while to very end he says financial stability for the Somali people both here and in Somalia is one of our strongest protections against the terroristic threat posed by al-shabaab we should be making it easier for our constituents to support their families not impugning the community for it Fox nine should issue a thorough correction and apology for irresponsible reporting Alicia I don't get why he would respond like this because nobody nobody's taking issue with immigrants sending money home to their families the issue here is fraud and of taxpayer money yeah the number one issue is fraud and stealing of taxpayer money the number two issue that this Fox 9 report actually was quite detailed in their investigation and the emails that they obtained and the law enforcement officials that they spoke to there's actually an investigation occurring so for Ellison to say that this is just some made-up Fox media coverage you know I'm sure he has a disdain for Fox in general given you know their how they are on the national and the international level but it's ridiculous I mean there's lots of evidence that posts that that purports this Fox 9 report and what this whistleblower said about where this money is going and how it was stolen from the voters of Minnesota his very own constituents and of course I'm sure the majority of the Somali Americans in his district that he claims to represent are equally perturbed by this and then that's the thing nobody is suggesting that this is representative of Somali Americans we are saying whoever is involved in this particular case of welfare fraud stealing taxpayer money those people should be held held accountable Ellison is the one that's making it about race and nationality this is what the left is what the left is all the time you and I have talked about this frequently on your very program is that they jump to women minority Oprah Judas that you know let's not look at the facts of the case let's try to make the other side look bad and let's try to make this a win I mean he's using a Rahm Emanuel tactic here you know he's trying to change the narrative to make it look as if he and his constituents you know are the victims at the hand of you know the the right wing machine that's trying to make immigrants look bad
