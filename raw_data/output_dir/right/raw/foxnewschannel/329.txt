1
00:00:02,231 --> 00:00:03,398
>> Jon: MIKE, THANKS.

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,734
>> Sandra: LET'S GO TO OUR

3
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:07,569
HEADLINER THIS MORNING, ALAN

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,806
DERSHOWITZ JOINS US.

5
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:18,446
HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR.

6
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:20,582
NOW IMPEACHING KAVANAUGH?

7
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,217
DOES IT LOOK LIKE DEMOCRATS ARE

8
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:24,085
PLANNING A STRATEGY TO DO SO?

9
00:00:24,086 --> 00:00:27,055
>> THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY

10
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:29,657
FOOLISH, INCONSISTENT AND

11
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:30,125
HYPOCRITICAL.

12
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:31,292
THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT BILL

13
00:00:31,293 --> 00:00:34,062
CLINTON SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN

14
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:35,196
IMPEACHED FOR ALLEGEDLY LYING

15
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:36,865
ABOUT HIS SEX LIFE ARE NOW

16
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:39,401
GOING TO LEAD THE CAMPAIGN TO

17
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:41,236
IMPEACH KAVANAUGH FOR ALLEGEDLY

18
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:43,037
LYING ABOUT HIS SEXUAL AND

19
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:44,806
DRINKING ACTIVITIES BACK WHEN

20
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:48,476
HE WAS A 17-YEAR-OLD?

21
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:57,852
IT'S HYPOCRISY  RUN RAMPANT.

22
00:00:57,853 --> 00:00:59,687
NOR WOULD IT PERMIT USING THE

23
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:00,955
LAWS OF PERJURY WHICH ARE TOUGH.

24
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:02,123
THEY HAVE TO BE ABOUT A

25
00:01:02,124 --> 00:01:05,360
MATERIAL FACT THAT HAS TO HAVE

26
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:09,764
BEEN A DELIBERATE LIE, NOT

27
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:11,399
FORGETFULNESS OR BOAST OR

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,234
EXAGGERATION BUT A MATERIAL LIE.

29
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:13,902
THE DEMOCRATS ARE SHOOTING

30
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:14,903
THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT.

31
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:18,106
WE OUGHT TO BE MOVING FORWARD.

32
00:01:18,107 --> 00:01:19,707
LET'S JUDGE JUSTICE KAVANAUGH

33
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,242
ON HIS PERFORMANCE AS A JUSTICE

34
00:01:21,243 --> 00:01:23,878
OF THE SUPREME COURT.

35
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:26,681
I'M PARTICULARLY OUTRAGED AT MY

36
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:28,349
COLLEAGUES AND STUDENTS AT

37
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,284
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, THOSE OF

38
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:32,086
THEM WHO HAVE MADE IT

39
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:32,921
IMPOSSIBLE FOR KAVANAUGH TO

40
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:36,024
CONTINUE TO TEACH THERE.

41
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:38,560
IT IS RAMPANT MCCARTHYISM AT

42
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:40,462
ITS WORST REMINISCENT OF WHAT I

43
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:44,165
EXPERIENCED AS A STUDENT IN THE

44
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:47,936
50s WHERE PROFESSORS WERE FIRED

45
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:49,103
BECAUSE THEY WHEN 17 OR 20

46
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:50,839
YEARS OLD THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN

47
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,340
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY.

48
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:54,676
WE HAVE TO PUT AN END TO THIS

49
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:56,311
AND THESE KIND OF VENGEANCE

50
00:01:56,312 --> 00:01:57,679
INQUISITIONS HAVE TO STOP.

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,147
>> Sandra: WE'VE COME TO THIS

52
00:01:59,148 --> 00:01:59,447
POINT.

53
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:01,149
DOES IT GET WORSE OR BETTER?

54
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,851
WHAT CHANGES?

55
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:06,087
>> I THINK THE LEADERSHIP OF

56
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:07,489
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS TO

57
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,359
TAKE CONTROL OVER THE ROGUE

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,761
MEMBERS AND TELL INDIVIDUALS

59
00:02:13,762 --> 00:02:16,164
LIKE MAXINE WATERS WHO SAYS SHE

60
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:17,265
WANTS TO IMPEACH VIRTUALLY

61
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:18,433
EVERYBODY FOR EVERYTHING

62
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:19,601
INCLUDING MIKE PENCE, THAT

63
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:20,368
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC

64
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:21,936
PARTY IS ALL ABOUT.

65
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:24,005
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS TO

66
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:25,006
BECOME MORE MAINSTREAM, HAS TO

67
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:26,574
LOOK TO THE FUTURE.

68
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:29,177
LOOK, THE DEMOCRATS LOST THIS

69
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:29,544
ELECTION.

70
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:31,513
THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO

71
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:32,680
APPOINT A CONSERVATIVE.

72
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:34,883
IF IT WASN'T KAVANAUGH IT WOULD

73
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:36,184
HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY MAYBE EVEN

74
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:38,953
TO THE RIGHT OF KAVANAUGH.

75
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:41,489
THE IDEA OF SEARCHING FOR

76
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,558
REASONS NOT TO CONFIRM AND

77
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:46,094
VIOLATING ALL KINDS OF DUE

78
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:46,561
PROCESS.

79
00:02:46,562 --> 00:02:49,464
NOW COMES THE ACLU WHICH PUTS

80
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:51,099
MONEY BEFORE PRINCIPLE AND MY

81
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,600
QUESTION TO THE ACLU, HOW WILL

82
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:55,503
YOU APPEAR IN FRONT OF THE

83
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:56,004
SUPREME COURT NOW?

84
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,705
YOU'VE ALIENATED ONE OF THE

85
00:02:57,706 --> 00:02:59,240
JUSTICES, MAYBE EVEN MORE.

86
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:03,011
I THINK THE ACLU HAS LOST ITS

87
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:04,445
CREDIBILITY AS A LITIGATION ARM

88
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:05,613
OF THE PROGRESSIVE CAUSE.

89
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:07,415
AND THEY MAY HAVE TO RECUSE

90
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,316
THEMSELVES WHEN THEY COME IN

91
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:10,385
FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT.

92
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:11,553
THIS HAS BECOME A TOTAL MESS

93
00:03:11,554 --> 00:03:14,088
AND WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO MOVE

94
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:15,924
FORWARD AND NOT TAKE REVENGE

95
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:16,624
FOR PAST LOSSES.

96
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,427
>> Jon: YOU HAVE WRITTEN A

97
00:03:19,428 --> 00:03:20,795
FASCINATING OP-ED ON FOX

98
00:03:20,796 --> 00:03:21,162
NEWS.COM.

99
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:22,864
I WOULD URGE OUR VIEWERS TO

100
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:24,499
READ IT SAYING YOU'RE A LIBERAL

101
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,569
DEMOCRAT AND LIKE TO SEE

102
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,571
DEMOCRATS TAKE BACK CONTROL OF

103
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:29,938
THE HOUSE.

104
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:31,906
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

105
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:35,176
>> Jon: IF THAT HAPPENS JERROLD

106
00:03:35,177 --> 00:03:36,544
NADLER WOULD BE THE SPEAKER.

107
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:38,913
>> THIS HAS TO BE THOROUGHLY

108
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:39,347
INVESTIGATED.

109
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:40,748
I HOPE THE SENATE WILL DO SO.

110
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:43,985
IF HE IS ON THE SUPREME COURT

111
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:44,686
AND THE SENATE HASN'T

112
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:45,553
INVESTIGATED, THEN I THINK THE

113
00:03:45,554 --> 00:03:46,888
HOUSE WILL HAVE TO.

114
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:48,856
>> Jon: WHAT WOULD BE YOUR

115
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:50,725
ADVICE TO REPRESENTATIVE NADLER?

116
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:53,361
>> FIRST OF ALL, DO NOT -- DO

117
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:55,129
NOT MOVE TOWARD IMPEACHMENT.

118
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,432
HE HASN'T MENTIONED THE I WORD

119
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:58,366
IMPEACHMENT YET.

120
00:03:58,367 --> 00:03:59,767
AS FAR AS AN INVESTIGATION IS

121
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:01,636
CONCERNED, WOULD IT BE ABOUT

122
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:03,071
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS?

123
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:03,972
LET'S HAVE A BIPARTISAN

124
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:06,841
INVESTIGATION AND SEE IF WE CAN

125
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:08,443
IMPROVE THE PROCESS.

126
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:10,578
MAYBE HAVE MORE CHECKS, F.B.I.

127
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:12,246
CHECKS PRIOR TO A NOMINEE BEING

128
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:14,449
NOMINATED SO WE DON'T HAVE

129
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,185
THESE KINDS OF SURPRISES.

130
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:17,784
ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS.

131
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:20,788
THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO.

132
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:22,857
MAYBE HAVE A COMMISSION THAT

133
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,926
NOMINATES TO THE PRESIDENT THE

134
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,060
10 MOST DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE

135
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:27,228
WHO COULD SERVE ON THE SUPREME

136
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,396
COURT AND LET THE PRESIDENT

137
00:04:28,397 --> 00:04:30,732
AGREE TO PICK FROM THAT INSTEAD

138
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:31,499
OF PICKING FROM THE FEDERALIST

139
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:31,833
SOCIETY.

140
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,067
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT

141
00:04:33,068 --> 00:04:35,403
CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE

142
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:35,737
PROCESS.

143
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:37,271
INVESTIGATING KAVANAUGH IS NOT

144
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:38,172
ONE OF THEM.

145
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:39,374
IMPEACHING KAVANAUGH IS

146
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,541
CERTAINLY NOT ANOTHER OF THEM.

147
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:42,510
>> Sandra: DESPITE WHAT WE TALK

148
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:44,712
ABOUT TODAY, ALAN DERSHOWITZ,

149
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:47,582
THERE ARE STILL MANY DEMOCRATS

150
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:52,253
VOWING A FIGHT INCLUDING HIRONO

151
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:52,687
FROM HAWAII.

152
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:54,555
HER LATEST THINKING.

153
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:56,858
>> SHOULD BRETT KAVANAUGH BE

154
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:57,792
IMPEACHED IF DEMOCRATS TAKE

155
00:04:57,793 --> 00:04:58,526
CONTROL?

156
00:04:58,527 --> 00:04:59,894
>> I'M MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON THE

157
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:01,429
HERE AND NOW WHICH IS WE HAVE

158
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,697
AN ELECTION COMING UP AND I'VE

159
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:06,367
SAID TO THE WOMEN WHO ARE

160
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:07,268
JUSTIFIABLY ANGRY BUT

161
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:07,669
DETERMINED.

162
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,239
I SAID THEY SHOULD BE JUST

163
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,375
FOCUSED LIKE A LASER BEAM.

164
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:15,710
>> Sandra: WE'RE LEFT WONDERING

165
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:16,944
WHAT THAT MEANS, ALAN.

166
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:19,747
SHE DID NOT SAY NO TO A FIGHT

167
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:20,248
FOR IMPEACHMENT.

168
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:22,083
>> I THINK SHE IS RIGHT.

169
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:23,184
I THINK DEMOCRATS SHOULD FOCUS

170
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:25,219
AND TRY TO TAKE OVER THE HOUSE.

171
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,287
THAT BECOMES AN IMPORTANT PART

172
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,823
OF OUR SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND

173
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:29,190
BALANCES.

174
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:30,458
IF THE DEMOCRATS CAN TAKE OVER

175
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:32,760
THE SENATE THEY'LL HAVE

176
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:34,395
ENORMOUS INFLUENCE ON THE NEXT

177
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:34,962
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE.

178
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:36,931
THAT OUGHT TO BE THE FOCUS.

179
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:38,599
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS NOT MY

180
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:38,933
CHOICE.

181
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:40,668
I'M A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT.

182
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:42,503
I WOULD HAVE APPOINTED MERRICK

183
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:43,871
GARLAND AGAIN BUT THE DEMOCRATS

184
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:47,075
HAVE TO BE WISE AND SENSIBLE

185
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:49,143
AND JUST AND MORAL AND NOT

186
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:50,978
VIOLATE DUE PROCESS AND CIVIL

187
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:53,781
LIBERTIES IN AN INTEREST OF

188
00:05:53,782 --> 00:05:56,451
WRECKING REVENGE ON A LOSS THAT

189
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:58,286
WAS IN LARGE PART

190
00:05:58,287 --> 00:05:59,020
SELF-INFLICTED BY EXTREMISTS

191
00:05:59,021 --> 00:05:59,520
WITHIN THE PARTY.

192
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:02,390
>> Jon: I WANT TO READ PART OF

193
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:04,826
THAT FOX OP-ED YOU WROTE.

194
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:06,461
YOU SAY DEMOCRATS MAY TRY TO

195
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:09,697
MOVE IT FORWARD BY ALLEGING THE

196
00:06:09,698 --> 00:06:11,766
GROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT INCLUDE

197
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,768
PERJURY COMMITTED BY NOMINEE

198
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:15,269
KAVANAUGH BUT THAT WOULD -- IN

199
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,273
HIS TESTIMONY AT THE SENATE

200
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:20,141
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

201
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:24,112
CONFIRMATION HEARING BUT THAT

202
00:06:24,113 --> 00:06:25,747
WOULD BE A PLOY.

203
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:27,115
YOU THINK THERE ARE COMPARISONS

204
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:28,983
BETWEEN HIM AND CLINTON.

205
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:31,486
>> THE IRONY IS THE VERY SAME

206
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:34,021
PEOPLE -- THE VERY SAME PEOPLE

207
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:36,324
WHO JUSTLY COMPLAINED ABOUT THE

208
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:37,959
USE OF PERJURY AGAINST BILL

209
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,294
CLINTON ARE NOW DEMANDING THE

210
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:41,629
USE OF PERJURY AGAINST

211
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:41,996
KAVANAUGH.

212
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:43,698
DO THEY HAVE NO SHAME?

213
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:45,333
DO THEY HAVE NO MEMORY?

214
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:47,602
DO THEY HAVE NO CONCERN ABOUT

215
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:48,569
BEING CALLED HYPOCRITES?

216
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,971
IS IT REALLY THE CASE THAT IF

217
00:06:49,972 --> 00:06:53,040
THE SHOE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT

218
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,909
THE PRINCIPLE GOES OUT THE

219
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,243
WINDOW?

220
00:06:55,244 --> 00:06:56,778
SHAME ON DEMOCRATS WHO WOULD

221
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:58,412
APPLY THE SAME PRINCIPLES THAT

222
00:06:58,413 --> 00:07:00,014
THEY OPPOSED WHEN BILL CLINTON

223
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:01,249
WAS IMPEACHED TO IMPEACH A

224
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,950
SITTING JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME

225
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:03,251
COURT.

226
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:03,751
SHAME ON THEM.

227
00:07:03,752 --> 00:07:08,055
>> Sandra: I THINK IT WAS

228
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:10,591
HIRONO WHO WE HEARD FROM ALSO

229
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:11,392
SAID LOOKING FORWARD BRETT

230
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:12,460
KAVANAUGH'S TIME ON THE SUPREME

231
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:13,861
COURT WILL BE TAINTED WAS THE

232
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:14,862
WORD SHE USED.

233
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:17,498
SHE SAID THERE WILL ALWAYS BE

234
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:20,701
AN ASTERISK NEXT TO HIS NAME.

235
00:07:20,702 --> 00:07:22,336
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT HIS TIME ON

236
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:24,071
THE SUPREME COURT TO LOOK LIKE

237
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:25,139
CONSIDERING THIS INTENSE FIGHT

238
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,974
HE WENT THROUGH FOR

239
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,642
CONFIRMATION?

240
00:07:27,643 --> 00:07:30,478
>> HE WILL BE LIKE OTHER

241
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,379
JUSTICES, A CONSERVATIVE.

242
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,247
HE WILL MOVE THE COURT SLIGHTLY

243
00:07:33,248 --> 00:07:34,248
TO THE RIGHT.

244
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:36,317
MY HOPE -- MY HOPE IS HAVING

245
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:38,119
BEEN THROUGH THIS HORRIBLE

246
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,520
EXPERIENCE MAYBE HIS

247
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:41,122
SENSITIVITIES WILL INCREASE

248
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:42,523
TOWARD DUE PROCESS, CIVIL

249
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:44,392
LIBERTIES, THE RIGHT OF FREE

250
00:07:44,393 --> 00:07:44,725
SPEECH.

251
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:46,527
BUT THE ASTERISK NEXT TO HIS

252
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:47,662
NAME IS RIDICULOUS.

253
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:48,362
HE WAS CONFIRMED.

254
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:50,998
HE WILL SERVE ON THE SUPREME

255
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:51,666
COURT.

256
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,301
THERE WILL BE NO ASTERISK, HE

257
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:55,369
WILL BE JUDGED LIKE EVERY OTHER

258
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:55,703
JUSTICE.

259
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:59,774
I WILL AGREE WITH SOME OF HIS

260
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:01,175
OPINIONS AND OPPOSE OTHERS, I

261
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:02,977
WILL WRITE OP YESTERDAY ON THE

262
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:05,079
OPINIONS I DISAGREE WITH.

263
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,848
THAT'S HOW OUR SYSTEM OF CHECKS

264
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:08,349
AND BALANCES SHOULD OPERATE

265
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,651
>> Sandra: YOU SAID AN

266
00:08:10,652 --> 00:00:00,000
INVESTIGATION INTO 36-YEAR-OLD
