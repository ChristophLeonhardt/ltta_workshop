tonight right now the Supreme Court fight is in its most pivotal phase Democrats pressing Trump nominee Brett Kavanaugh in a session that's expected to run well into the night the Democrats have largely shifted from yesterday's demands for documents to regular order today but many protesters not making that pivot continuing direct action protests to argue this whole hearing is illegitimate they point to Republican hypocrisy and blocking Obama's nominee and to the concern that a president under investigation shouldn't get to ram through a judge who could rule on that very case or rule on Trump's reported efforts to end the investigation which would include the attempted firing of special counsel Bob Moore which Democrats press today you just write a special counsel fireball at will or only for cause and matter conception of what's the most appropriate structure so that's the hypothetical that you're asking me hypotheticals Award nominees used to duck answers Cavanaugh also did that on the pretty straightforward question of whether the Constitution allows the President to pardon himself that's something even Richard Nixon didn't do President Trump claims he has an absolute right to pardon himself does he the question of self pardons is something I've never analyzed it's a question that I have not written about it's a question therefore that's a hypothetical question does the president have the ability to pardon somebody in exchange for a promise for that person they wouldn't testify against him Sarah I'm not going to answer hypothetical questions of that sort you can see there why the hearings are so exciting now Cavanaugh did try to show where he stood on the hypothetical of overturning Roe vs. Wade he said it's not only important but sort of a super precedent because it's been reaffirmed so much what would you say your position today is on a woman's right to choose as a judge as a judge as a judge it is an important president of the Supreme Court by it I mean roe v wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey and reaffirm many times Casey is precedent on precedent precedent on precedent I am joined by people who know their way around precedence general Eiffel is the president of the n-double a-c-p Legal Defense on at least Hulk president of narrow pro-choice America and my favorite legal eagle NPR's Nina Totenberg who is furiously still covering the hearing there at Ground Zero my thanks to all of you this is big sherilyn off the top did judge Cavanaugh help or hurt himself today so I think he heard himself today and I want to disagree with you this was very exciting it was exciting it really was I didn't realize now I know it was I was there all day yesterday listen there were very important moments and we learned a lot about judge Cavanaugh and there was a mix of substance and process that was really important you know the whole issue about the documents the documents we don't have from Cavanaugh's time when he worked for President Bush that was interwoven with some of the colloquy that you showed at the top of the hour Senator Leahy for example brought a line of questioning about whether or not Cavanaugh had received confidential documents that had been stolen from Senator Leahy in 2002 at the time that Cavanaugh worked on judicial nominees and what Cavett what what lay he did was he questioned the nominee up to the point that he couldn't use documents that the chair of the committee has deemed committee confidential and Leahy said something pretty extraordinary he said that he had documents that would contradict the testimony that Judge Cavanaugh was making right in the chambers later it happened again with Chris Coons from Delaware he was engaged in a really important colloquy with the nominee about executive power executive privilege about the Morrison case and about the Independent Counsel and the special counsel and whether the president has the power to be free from investigation while in office which is the key issue with with Trump and Kuhn said that there are four documents that he thinks are critical from Cavanaugh's past to be able to flush out the head which goes to secrecy the Democrats have been hammering turning to you at least one thing I've learned legally is that generally if I have a legal concept and sherrilyn Ifill has to correct me she probably has it right so they were exciting hearings and I want to correct that for the record my question to you is what does it tell you that more than any other issue or quote hypothetical row and choice was the place where judge Cavanaugh claimed and suggested and intimated that he will not overturn Roe I did not hear him say that one bit super-president is not a thing and what we did here and what we've heard all through his meetings is he believes in Roberts interpretation of settled law right Roberts has been a reliable anti-abortion vote every step of the way he did say you know he used a lot of code language and in fact senator Blumenthal called him on it afterwards he used a lot of abortion on demand language which is code to the anti-choice movement in fact there was in fact after your super president comment life news sent out a missive to their members being like pay no attention it's all good for viewers who aren't watching the entire exciting hearing let me play a little bit more of the so-called super precedent from Kavanagh today Planned Parenthood versus Casey reaffirmed Roe and did so by considering the story decisis factors so Casey now becomes a precedent on precedent roe v wade is an important precedent the Supreme Court this is something central to a woman's life when government controls that decision for her she's being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices I think you see the contrast right there oriane I think that that's what 60% of Americans in an ABC poll said that they wanted to hear Tuesday morning they want to hear straight answers on whether or not he is actually going to embrace the idea of the fundament of mental freedom of access to abortion well you did not hear him say which was very very disturbing was when senator Feinstein remind him that women died before Roe what he said is I understand you believe that I understand you feel passionately about that you thought that was a tell he did not say it's factual that women died I have concerns that women might die again and so what we heard was code words that gave no one any sense of comfort who sits where I said that he will do anything other than in Rowan criminalize abortion and a lack of empathy for the consequence for millions of American women let me go to Nina Totenberg who as I mentioned is covering the hearings live we just talked about the secrecy issues as well as the choice issues what else do you think came through in this in this hearing today well I thought actually the exchange with Dianne Feinstein about guns was pretty illuminating judge Kavanagh as a judge wrote a dissenting opinion dissenting in a panel with were the other conservative members of the panel upheld the DC ban on semi-automatic assault rifles and magazines of more than ten rounds and in that dissent he basically said that in the view of the Supreme Court this is the way he interpreted a decision and his view that the right to bear arms is an act and is analogous to the right of free speech and that we would no belong we would know more ban a category of arms than we would a category of speech that was his dissenting opinion and he didn't walk back from that at all today right which is crazy has been the word of the day here a colloquially an earlier blocks about this op-ed that's many people would say legally crazy pants I mean it's well known that I would not say that yeah you said that stop saying I'm saying it's crazy pants just so that everyone understands but because obviously you can regulate the grenades and nuclear weapons differently than smaller weapons the notion I think that the Constitution forbids that is a stretch I want to also play for you Nina some sound of hand raising really that that shows that Cavanaugh had at least publicly presented the idea that you can't indict a sitting president previous to today take a look how many of you believe as a matter of law that a sitting president cannot be indicted during the term of office just raise it up one two three four five six seven eight nine more than half the panel believes that was a public answer then how did that compare to his answer today in your view of the way the Muller and criminal probe questions came up well as he pointed out the position of the Department of Justice has for 45 years been that you cannot indict a sitting president that's why the Watergate special prosecutor made Richard Nixon an unindicted co-conspirator now that doesn't say you can't present information to Congress of criminal activity that would lead to an impeachment but the position of the Department of Justice in Democratic and Republican administrations has been that you can't indict a sitting president and so in that sense it's not extraordinary but it does feed into his other views often expressed that that that investigations of the president are harmful he proposed has proposed in the LA Review piece legislation to make criminal investigation of president something that can't be done during the president's term of office or even civil suits and it's it's clearly his experience also as he made very clear today after 9/11 he said for George Bush for the next year every year what every day was September 12th and that anything that diverted him from that was harming the country and that is I think he's made pretty clear that he has grave doubts about how far you can go investigating a president and I and he very carefully did not answer or suggest any answers or suggest that he did not even fully embrace today the Nixon tapes case he said that he thought it was one of the great decisions of the court because the court stood up was independent and stood up in a time of national crisis but when senator vici impressed him on whether he thought it was correctly decided he hemmed in hard hey I'm already Melvin from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our youtube
