you know when you're in a relationship particularly for a long time you kind of stop noticing somebody psychologists call it habituation you get used to something you stop realizing why you wanted to be there in the first place and we so often do that with relationships the people that we most care about the people who are supposed to be most important to us are sometimes the people that were least likely to thank in the survey that we did for the gratitude Diaries we found out that people are actually more likely to say thank you to the barista at the coffee shop or the guy who delivers their mail than they are to the person who they're supposed to love most in the entire world well it's really easy to change that stop actually say thank you recognize what somebody has done for you or why you appreciate them hey just tell him he's really handsome that goes pretty far - it starts to change the tenor of the relationship some people worry that if they do that they're gonna lose power in the relationship that they are appreciating the other person and they want to be appreciated well hopefully it starts to work both ways if you appreciate someone they're going to appreciate you back if they don't maybe that tells you something about the relationship
