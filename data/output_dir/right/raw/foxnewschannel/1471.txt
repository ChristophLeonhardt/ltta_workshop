1
00:00:03,611 --> 00:00:04,645
PERINO.

2
00:00:04,645 --> 00:00:06,647
"THE FIVE"

3
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:11,886
>> IT'S DAY TWO IN NEIL GATE.

4
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:14,322
BOTH SIDES LINEUP ON OPPOSITE

5
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:15,256
ENDS OF THE FIELD.

6
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:18,092
FIRST IT'S DONALD TRUMP DOING

7
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:19,193
DONALD TRUMP.

8
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:21,195
President: YOU HAVE TO STAND

9
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:22,496
PROUDLY FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM

10
00:00:22,496 --> 00:00:24,599
OR YOU SHOULDN'T BE PLAYING, YOU

11
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:25,933
SHOULDN'T BE THERE, MAYBE YOU

12
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:27,668
SHOULDN'T BE IN THE COUNTY.

13
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:30,571
YOU HAVE TO STAND PROUDLY FOR

14
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:31,639
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

15
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:34,242
THE NFL OWNERS HAVE DONE THE

16
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:34,675
RIGHT THING.

17
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:36,477
>> IF THAT'S THE STORY, HAVE YOU

18
00:00:36,477 --> 00:00:38,546
PUSHED IT FORWARD TO A

19
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:38,946
CONCLUSION?

20
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:41,515
President: I THINK THE PEOPLE

21
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:43,217
PUSHED IT FORWARD.

22
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:44,585
I BROUGHT IT OUT.

23
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,587
THE PEOPLE PUSH IT DID FORWARD.

24
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:49,090
>> ANOTHER HARDIN TER VIEW.

25
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,292
GIVE THAT GUY A RAZOR SOMETHING

26
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:52,193
TO STAND ON.

27
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:53,027
>> BRUTAL.

28
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:56,130
>> YOU EXPECT THAT FROM TRUMP.

29
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,266
HE FINDS A ISSUE AND TAKES A

30
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,836
HARD LINE STANCE.

31
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:02,270
LESS.

32
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,306
HE'S YOUR UNCLE, UNCLE SAM.

33
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:08,075
THAT DIDN'T STOP THE PEARL

34
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:10,645
CLUTCHERS FROM CLUTCHING THEIR

35
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:10,978
PEARLS.

36
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:12,513
>> IT'S DISGRACEFUL.

37
00:01:12,513 --> 00:01:14,715
>> IF YOU HAVE THE POSITION TO

38
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:16,751
DO IT, DO IT.

39
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:18,019
>> IT'S ABSURD.

40
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,220
HE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THE LEADER

41
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,524
OF THE FREE WORLD.

42
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:26,294
>> REMEMBER HOW THIS STARTED.

43
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,297
SPEAKING TO A CROWD WHITE

44
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,432
FOOTBALL CROWD, CALLING THEM SOB

45
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:32,967
SKP *Z SAYING THEY SHOULD BE

46
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,301
FIRED.

47
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,770
IN WHAT WORLD OTHER THAN HIS IS

48
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,237
THAT OKAY?

49
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:37,405
>> AMERICA.

50
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:39,840
THEY MISS THE POINT THE FIRST

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,409
AMENDMENT IS A RIGHT HELD

52
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:42,576
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.

53
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:45,513
A PRIVATE ENTITY LIKE THE NFL,

54
00:01:45,513 --> 00:01:47,481
THEY OWN IT AND MAKE THE RULES.

55
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:50,151
AS LONG AS THERE IS NO

56
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,786
DISCRIMINATION THE TEAMES CAN

57
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:53,387
MANDATE THE TEAMS PLAY IN HIGH

58
00:01:53,387 --> 00:01:57,291
HEELS AND THE REVERIES WORK IN

59
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:57,959
TUTUS.

60
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,927
THE PLAYERS CAN PROTEST BUT THEY

61
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:02,363
WILL BE PENALIZED IF IT'S DONE

62
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:04,532
DURING A GAME.

63
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:06,300
PENALIZED NOT JAILED.

64
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,369
THE PLAYERS ARE EMPLOYEES AT

65
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:09,804
WORK DISOBEYING A RULE.

66
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:11,339
WHERE ARE YOU IN ALL OF THIS?

67
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,407
WHERE YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN,

68
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:14,475
SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD.

69
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:17,278
YOU PREFER UNIT OVER CONFLICT.

70
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:19,981
YOU DON'T MIND DISSENT.

71
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:21,816
IT'S THE DISSENSION.

72
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:24,618
MIND YOU YOU ENJOY A GOOD

73
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:24,952
DEBATE.

74
00:02:24,952 --> 00:02:28,389
THAT'S WHY YOU WATCH "THE FIVE."

75
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:31,225
THIS IS LIKE TURNING ON THIS

76
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:34,128
SHOW AND SEEING ME AND DANA

77
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:38,699
PLAYING BAD

78
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,835
PLAYING BATMITON FOR AN HOUR.

79
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:43,671
AND SEEING ME IN TIGHT WHITE

80
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:47,575
SHORTS IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR 5

81
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:47,942
5:00 P.M.

82
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:48,743
>> OR EVER.

83
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:51,245
>> GLASS HOUSES, TINY DANCER.

84
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:51,946
GLASS HOUSES.

85
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:55,783
>> I'M NOT SCARED.

86
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:56,283
ALRIGHT.

87
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:57,318
JESSE, WELCOME BACK.

88
00:02:57,318 --> 00:02:59,420
YOU HAD STREP THROAT.

89
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,254
WE MISSED YOU.

90
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:02,289
>> YES, TRUMP WAS RIGHT.

91
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,191
I WAS SICK OF WINNING.

92
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:06,894
>> TIRED OF WINNING.

93
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:10,064
>> A PURELY NATURAL VACATION.

94
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:10,598
>> YES.

95
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:12,633
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP.

96
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:15,636
>> I READ "REASON" MAGAZINE.

97
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:20,641
THEY SAY THE NFL BOWED TO TRUMP.

98
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:24,311
I FELT THEY WANTED TO NIP THIS

99
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:27,648
IN THE BUD.

100
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:30,084
>> I DON'T READ REASON.

101
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,752
I READ THE WEEKLY STANDARD.

102
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:33,587
THAT'S WHAT YOU GAVE ME A

103
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:35,256
SUBSCRIPTION FOR.

104
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:39,794
NOBODY IS TRAMPLING ANYONE'S

105
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:41,162
CONSTITUTIONS AL RIGHTS.

106
00:03:41,162 --> 00:03:43,631
THEY'RE EMPLOYEES LIKE US AT

107
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:44,465
INFORMATION NEWS.

108
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:46,100
THIS ARE RULES.

109
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,438
HR RULES, PR RULES.

110
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,306
AFTER AWHILE PEOPLE CHANGE THE

111
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:53,841
CHANNEL AND THE RATINGS WOULD

112
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:56,477
DIP, THE COMPANY CEO WOULD SAY

113
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:57,678
CAN YOU STOP DOING THAT.

114
00:03:57,678 --> 00:03:59,380
IF YOU SAY NO, YOU'RE FIRED.

115
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,848
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

116
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:02,817
YOU WEAR THEIR JERSEY, YOU'RE IN

117
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:04,518
THEIR STADIUM, YOU PLAY FOR

118
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:05,553
THEIR TEAM.

119
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:08,122
THEY CAN TELL WHAT YOU TO DO OR

120
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,090
WHAT NOT TO DO.

121
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,693
IT'S A GREAT IDEA TRUMP ISN'T

122
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:14,128
GOING TO DEPORT PLAYERS.

123
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,397
HE'S SAYING LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT

124
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:19,300
HE LIKES THE COUNTRY SO MUCH.

125
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,535
IT'S HYPERBOLA.

126
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:26,207
THE KNEELING THING HURT.

127
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:29,243
SPEAK YOUR MIND ON ESPN, FOX

128
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:30,444
NEWS, TWITTER.

129
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:31,912
ON SUNDAY PLAY FOOTBALL.

130
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:32,613
IT HURT.

131
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:35,649
IT HURT THE COMMISSIONER, HE WAS

132
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:37,218
HIT HARD BECAUSE OF HIS

133
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:39,720
RESPONSE.

134
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:41,155
IT HURT THE PLAYERS.

135
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,524
SOME OF THE PLAYERS THAT KNEELED

136
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:45,392
ARE FREE AGENTS AND HAVING A

137
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:47,061
HARD TIME GETTING RESIGNED.

138
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:49,230
IT HURT THE DEMOCRATS.

139
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,998
THEY SIDEPUGH WITH 75% OF THE

140
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:51,565
COUNT ROW.

141
00:04:51,565 --> 00:04:53,400
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD THING AND

142
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,035
I'M GLAD IT'S RESOLVED.

143
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:57,972
>> ANOTHER ARGUMENT FOR NOT

144
00:04:57,972 --> 00:05:00,908
DETP-PING THE NFL -- DEFENDING

145
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:02,610
THE NFL BAND THIS.

146
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,612
IS LIKE SHUTTING DOWN SPEAKERS

147
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:05,212
ON CAMPUS.

148
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:07,414
YOU'RE A SNOW FLAKE IF YOU DON'T

149
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:08,649
WANT THEM TO NEIL.

150
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:09,884
>>

151
00:05:09,884 --> 00:05:12,920
NEIL.>>

152
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:12,953
KNIL.>>

153
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:12,987
KNEE.>>

154
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:14,788
KNEEL.>> I SAW THAT TODAY.

155
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:17,191
I DON'T THINK THE GOVERNMENT

156
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,726
SHOULD TELL PRIVATE COMPANIES

157
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:19,627
WHAT TO DO.

158
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:20,327
I'M FOR.

159
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:22,997
THAT COLLEGES ARE MEANT TO BE

160
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:24,398
PLACES FOR FRO EXPRESSION.

161
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:26,734
MOST OF THEM GET TAXPAYER

162
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:27,201
DOLLARS.

163
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:31,405
I GUESS YOU CAN SAY THE NFL

164
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:33,007
SHOULDN'T GET TAXPAYER DOLLARS

165
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:34,608
FOR STADIUM FUNDS.

166
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:36,977
I'M FOR THAT TOO. THE NFL IS TO

167
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:37,945
PLAY FOOT PAUL.

168
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:40,514
YOU DON'T EXPECT A FREE EXCHANGE

169
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:43,217
OF IDEAS LIKE A COLLEGE CAMPUS.

170
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,519
>> FREE EXCHANGE OF HELMETS TO

171
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,254
THE HEAD.

172
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:49,456
MARIE, YOU CAN'T SAY THIS IS

173
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:51,458
DISCRIMINATING IF IT APPLIES TO

174
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,359
EVERYONE, CORRECT?

175
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,495
>> I THINK WHAT THE NFL DIDN'T

176
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:56,630
DO CORRECTLY, IN MY OPINION.

177
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,600
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY

178
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,901
COMMUNICATED ADEQUATELY WITH THE

179
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:03,904
PLAYER ASSOCIATION BEFORE THEY

180
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:04,505
RELEASED THIS.

181
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:08,042
NOW THERE IS A FIGHT OF

182
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:09,476
INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS AND THE NFL.

183
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:11,111
I KNOW THEY WANT THIS OUT OF THE

184
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:12,913
WAY BEFORE THE NEXT SEASON, I

185
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:13,514
GET THAT.

186
00:06:13,514 --> 00:06:15,516
IT HAS RESEEDED FROM THE

187
00:06:15,516 --> 00:06:15,983
HEADLINES.

188
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:17,851
IF THEY COORDINATED THIS AND HAD

189
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:19,353
A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THIS.

190
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:20,120
IS THE MAN.

191
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,425
WE WILL FINE PLAYERS IF THEY

192
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:24,792
KNEEL.

193
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:27,461
WE WILL ALSO TAKE THE FIVE

194
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:29,296
COMMUNITY ACTIVISM STEPS PLAYERS

195
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:31,732
HAVE ASKED FOR.

196
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:33,834
IT SEEMS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A

197
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:35,202
BETTER WAY TO MOVE FORWARD.

198
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:36,737
AND THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS,

199
00:06:36,737 --> 00:06:38,672
THROW MORE GASOLINE ON THE FOYER

200
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:40,808
OF A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE.

201
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:43,043
I THINK THE NFL COULD OF HANDLED

202
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:43,744
THIS BETTER.

203
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:45,145
NOW YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE THE

204
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:47,248
OWNER OF THE JETS SAYING HE WILL

205
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:50,317
PAY THE FINE IF HIS PLAYERS GET

206
00:06:50,317 --> 00:06:50,618
THEM.

207
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,752
HE WON'T PASS IT ON.

208
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:56,457
HE WANTS HIS PLAYERS TO EXPRESS

209
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:56,857
THEMSELVES.

210
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:59,593
>> THAT'S A INTERESTING POINT,

211
00:06:59,593 --> 00:06:59,860
KG.

212
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,064
IT PUNS THE OWNNESS ON THE OTHER

213
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:04,398
OWNERS.

214
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:07,067
IT'S THE OWNERS OWNNESS.

215
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,336
IT'S THE OWNNESS ON THE OWNERS.

216
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:11,338
NOW THE JETS ARE DOING IT,

217
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:12,306
SHOULD WE DO IT?

218
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,774
I DON'T KNOW.

219
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:15,075
WILL THE STRUGGLE CONTINUE.

220
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,711
>> YES, A EMPLOYING PRESSURE.

221
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:19,780
PROBABLY A SIMPLER TERM TO USE,

222
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,882
YOU STRUGGLED DEEPLY WITH THAT.

223
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:23,417
HE WILL DO THAT, WHAT ABOUT THE

224
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:24,385
REST OF YOU?

225
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:25,419
SHOW UP.

226
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:26,120
PAY UP.

227
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,122
I A GROW WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP ON

228
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:28,622
THIS.

229
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,057
THEY'RE PAID MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

230
00:07:30,057 --> 00:07:32,026
FOR A PRIVILEGE TO PLAY IN ONE

231
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:34,261
OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST SPORTS.

232
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:35,929
ONE I LOVE TO WATCH AS WELL.

233
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:37,998
THIS IS A TIME FOR SOCIAL

234
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:39,166
JUSTICE AND ACTIVISM.

235
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,602
I LOVE IT EXPRESS YOUR SELF

236
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:43,537
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE FOUGHT FOR IN

237
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:45,239
THIS COUNTRY.

238
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:48,042
SO WE CAN SIT HERE WITH CRAZY,

239
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,810
INSANE OPINIONS AT THE TABLE --

240
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,146
>> WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?

241
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:53,747
>> A SIDE GLANCE.

242
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:55,949
ONE EYE AT YOU AND ONE AT GREG.

243
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:57,851
>> AMAZING HOW SHE DOES THAT.

244
00:07:57,851 --> 00:07:59,720
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

245
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,921
I PRACTICE A LOT.

246
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,124
WE'RE PAID A -- WE'RE PAID TO DO

247
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:04,725
A JOB.

248
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:06,660
WE WORK FOR THIS COMPANY.

249
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,729
THEY WORK FOR DIFFERENT TEAMS IN

250
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:09,763
THE NFL.

251
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:11,899
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM DON'T PLAY

252
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:12,199
THEN.

253
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,702
THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SAY.

254
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:19,039
I LIKE THE USE OF HIGH

255
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:19,073
I LIKE THE USE OF HYPH

256
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:22,476
I LIKE THE USE OF HYPERBLY.

257
00:08:22,476 --> 00:08:24,411
THAT WAS EXCELLENT, JESSE.

258
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:25,412
>> THANK YOU.

259
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:28,515
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS HERE GO

260
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:31,151
PLAY IN CAN THAT.

261
00:08:31,151 --> 00:08:33,287
>> GO PLAY FOR THE FRENCH.

262
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:35,089
NO UNIFORMS --

263
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:37,591
>> PUGH NA POINT TOUCH.

264
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:40,361
>> THE UNDERLYING TRUTH I HAVE A

265
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:41,628
INKLING EVERYONE WANTS THIS

266
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:43,563
BEHIND THEM.

267
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:48,635
EVEN COLONEL EN

268
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:49,403
EVEN COLINEL EN

269
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:49,436
EVEN COLIN K EN

270
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:49,470
EVEN COLIN KAEN

271
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:49,803
EVEN COLIN KAEPERNICK.

272
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:51,638
I THINK THEY FEEL, THIS WASN'T

273
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:53,040
SUPPOSE TO GO THIS LONG.

274
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,074
>> YES.

275
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:56,610
WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING.

276
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,213
WE'RE ALL FOR AMERICA.

277
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:00,948
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE NFL

278
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:02,182
TRIED TO DO.

279
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:04,118
THEY HANDLED IT PRETTY WELL.

280
00:09:04,118 --> 00:09:05,552
THEY HAVE TO DO IT AT SHOULD

281
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:06,019
POINT DO.

282
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:09,390
IT NOW, GET IT OVER WITH, OWNERS

283
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,424
MEETING AND MOVE ON.

284
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,092
NOW THEY HAVE LAID OUT THE

285
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:13,694
POLICY, IF IT CONTINUES TO

286
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:14,862
HAPPEN.

287
00:09:14,862 --> 00:09:18,365
I COULDN'T SEE HOW IT WOULD.

288
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:19,500
UNLESS YOU'RE THE JETS.

289
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,201
THEY HAVE LAID OUT THE POLICY.

290
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,771
NOW IF YOU DO IT AND GET FIRED

291
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,172
YOU'RE ACTUALLY FOYERING

292
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:25,539
YOURSELF.

293
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:26,507
YOU'RE MAKING A CHOICE.

294
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,175
>> YES.

295
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:30,644
AGAIN IT'S ANOTHER ISSUE, JESSE.

296
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:32,279
WERE YOU HEAR WHEN WE TALKED

297
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,016
ABOUT LAUREL AND YANI.

298
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:37,651
IT'S LAUREL AND YANI.

299
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:40,454
>> YES IT'S NOT 50/50.

300
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:44,491
IT'S LIKE 80/20 IN THE COUNTRY.

301
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,727
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM TALKING

302
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:51,598
ABOUT RACE AND POLICE BRUTALITY.

303
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:54,468
IT'S FINE TO BE ABOUT ACTIVISM.

304
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,437
IT'S ABOUT SYMBOLS WITH THESE

305
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:56,770
PEOPLE.

306
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,139
THEY WEAR THE HAT, WALK OUT OF

307
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,941
CLASS OVER GUNS, DO THE BLACK

308
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:01,775
POWER THING.

309
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,010
THAT'S FINE.

310
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,145
THEN WE ASK, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO

311
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,114
DO, WHAT IS THE SOLUTION.

312
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:08,982
THEY SAY WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

313
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,717
BUT DON'T OFFER A SOLUTION.

314
00:10:10,717 --> 00:10:12,619
I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

315
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:14,888
WHAT DO THE PLAYERS WANT?

316
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:17,090
WHAT ARE THEY SPECIFICALLY

317
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:17,558
ADDRESSING?

318
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:20,294
WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS TO POLICE

319
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:21,795
BRUTALITY AND RACISM.

320
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:23,864
NOBODY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE.

321
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:26,200
IT JUST LOOKED UNPATRIOTIC.

322
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,470
>> THE NFL CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE

323
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,939
ANOTHER SEASON -- NOT JUST THE

324
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:33,607
RATINGS BUT THERE ARE MANY

325
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:34,074
PRESSURES.

326
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:35,042
PEOPLE WATCHING DIFFERENT

327
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:35,375
THINGS.

328
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,345
ALSO THIS RECENT DECISION BY THE

329
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,347
SUPREME COURT ABOUT SPORTS

330
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:40,681
BETTING.

331
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,716
THAT'S A BIGGER ISSUE FOR THE

332
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:43,884
NFL TO DEAL WITH NOW.

333
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:46,620
>> ALSO THE BRAIN INJURIES.

334
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,156
>> YES, THAT'S A BIGGER ISSUE

335
00:10:49,156 --> 00:10:52,459
LONG TERM FOR THE NFL.

336
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:55,596
THERE ARE PLAYERS LIKE MALCOLM

337
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:57,164
JENKINS, IF YOU WENT TO OHIO

338
00:10:57,164 --> 00:10:59,166
STATE, HE HAS PLANS AND IDEAS OF

339
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,902
HOW TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY

340
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:03,670
ACTIVISTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENTS.

341
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,606
HE'S DOING THE MEETINGS ON HIS

342
00:11:05,606 --> 00:11:07,040
OWN WITH OTHER PLAYERS.

343
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,575
MORE PLAYERS SHOULD DO THAT LIKE

344
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:09,877
HE HAS BEEN DOING.

345
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:10,777
>> YES.

346
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:13,647
>> LAST WORD, KIMBERLY.

347
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:15,616
>> THINK THEY SHOULD FOCUS ON

348
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:17,551
PLAYING FOOTBALL.

349
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,654
IF THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR JOBS.

350
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:24,358
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO

351
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:24,758
KAEPERNICK.

352
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:27,227
>> I FEEL BAD ABOUT THE 49ERS.

353
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:27,861
>> RIGHT.

354
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,530
THEY WERE THE BEST TEAM EVER.

355
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,499
EVERYONE LOOKED UP TO THE 49ERS.

356
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:34,935
WE HAD THE BEST QUARTER BACKS.

357
00:11:34,935 --> 00:00:00,000
STEVE YOUNG, RONNIE LOTT.
