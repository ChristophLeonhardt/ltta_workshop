Manafort and Michael Kohn we begin today with the sort of latest updates on the Michael Cohen situation because Michael Kohn it turns out is the greater threat to the President of the United States then is Paul Manafort to recap Michael Cohen pled guilty to campaign finance violations and he suggested that the President had informed him and told him to commit these campaign finance violations he'd instructed him to create all these shell corporations and avoid going from normal disclosure routes in order to pay off to separate women Karen McDougal and stormy Daniels with whom he had once had sex just before the election in order to impact the election now there are a couple of cases today as to why this is not actually legal violation one of those cases being made by Bradley Smith I discussed this over the last couple days he's a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission he has a piece over at The Washington Post about this and what he basically argues is that it is not a campaign expenditure when you are paying off a former lover his rationale is that this is a personal expenditure you may be doing it for a variety of reasons maybe you're doing it because you want to avoid ticking off your wife that was John Edwards his case he said that he silenced real hunter remember the 2008 presidential candidate for the Democrats he had knocked up a woman who is not his cancer-ridden wife because John Edwards is a piece of human trash and then he had basically had his donors pay the woman a million dollars to shut up that ended up coming out he ended up being prosecuted for it his case was that he was paying off real hunter because he didn't want to tick off his wife it had nothing to do with the election that was dubious he was tried on it there was a hung jury and he ended up basically getting off well that's sort of the case that Bradley Smith is making he is saying under the theory that then candidate Donald Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen violated campaign finance laws by arranging hush money payments to women accusing Trump of affairs the answer would seem to be yes to the question of whether a business owner running for political office deciding to pay bonuses to him to his employees would be a campaign expenditure he says that that's a problem that we can't equate everything with a campaign expenditure everything you do in your own interest or that influences a campaign can't be a campaign expenditure you decide to give your employees a bonus just before the election that's not necessarily a campaign expenditure because maybe you would have given that bonus to your employees in the absence of the campaign anyway Bradley Smith says regardless of what Cohn agreed to in a plea bargain hush money payments to mistresses are not really campaign expenditures it is true that contribution and expenditure are defined in the federal election campaign act as anything for the purpose of influencing any election and it may have been intended in hoped that paying hush money would serve that end the problem is that almost anything a candidate does can be interpreted as intended to influence an election from buying a good watch to make sure he gets to places on time to getting a massage that he feels fit on the campaign trail to buying a new suits that he looks good on his abate stage yet having campaign donors pay for personal luxuries seems more like bribery than funding campaign speech so he's making the case that basically this is not a campaign expenditure this is a personal expenditure by the President of the United States the test under FEC rules is the so-called irrespective test the irrespective test says would this expenditure have been made irrespective of whether the campaign was happening and as I've argued I think that there's a plausible case Trump could say I would have made this senator anyway because he has a long history of pressuring women to stay silent and paying women off to stay silent back in 2011 he basically threatened to sue in Touch magazine for printing an interview with stormy Daniels and they backed off and did not print the interview with stormy Daniels about her affair with then reality television producer and star Donald Trump so Trump has a case on these grounds there's a secondary case here and that's the case being made over at Politico by a bunch of legal experts they say that Cohen's admission that he violated campaign finance law while acting at Trump's direction is far from rock-solid proof that the president is also guilty even if Cohn is being entirely truthful some lawyers say the fact that Cohen did something illegal doesn't mean Trump did anything illegal said gen Barron a longtime Republican campaign finance lawyer Cohen said in court on Tuesday that he acted at Trump's direction and violated federal election laws by arranging the payout to stormy Daniels an adult film actress in the days before the 2016 election to keep her silent about what she said was an affair with Trump a decade earlier Andrew gruel however University of Iowa law professor he says under the law it's quite easy for two people involved in the same act to have different criminal consequences that distinction is particularly critical in campaign finance cases because the law limits criminal prosecution for campaign finance violations two instances where someone quote knowingly and willfully defied legal requirements so in other words if Trump called up Michael Cohen and he said dude I'd like for you to make this go away and Michael Cohen says don't worry I'll take care of it that is not Trump being complicit in a campaign finance violation because he assumes that Cohen knows all the legal requirements if however Trump says to Michael Cohen listen I need you to make this go away and it doesn't matter if you violate campaign finance law or I know that we should shield this from public scrutiny by using a bunch of shell corporations and let's say Cohen has him on tape saying all of that stuff then it looks more like a campaign create a criminal campaign finance violation Cohen said under oath the most damaging information that the President of the United States committed a crime and covered it up but that is not actually indicative that the president has criminal intent so this one lawyer Gen Baron says in order to prove criminal intent you have to point to evidence that the actors knew or had reason to know than what they were doing was illegal Trump can simply claim ignorance and that may in fact be the case that he is making right that may be his strongest case he sort of made that case a little bit yesterday we'll get to Trump's response to all of this so Trump has of Defense's that are relatively robust here defense number one I pay off limit all the time this wasn't a campaign expenditure defense number two even if it was a campaign expenditure I didn't know the rules because I have people whose job it is to know that stuff and I didn't order anyone knowingly to violate campaign finance laws because why the hell would I do that also a relatively strong defense so ignorant and sluttiness are the president's two defenses and both are quite plausible because the president gets around and has for a long time and has paid women to shut up for apparently a long time and because the president is not exactly a legal expert despite his own belief that he is and president Trump is actually a terrible legal crying because he thinks he knows more than his lawyers which is always the first mark of a bad legal claim in fact if God could have come up with a bad legal client in the laboratory before putting him on earth he'd look a lot like Donald Trump who just will not let his lawyers do their job I'm Chuck Todd I actually asked lanny davis trucks out over at MSNBC s lanny davis was Michael Cohen's lawyer and this is the great irony of course is lanny davis was was bill clinton's water back during the engagement scandal tonight whipped sides and lanny davis is now going after the president he is asked by Chuck Todd if there's any corroborate of evidence that Michael Cohen is telling the truth that when Michael Cohen says that Trump told him to violate campaign finance law is there any evidence that corroborates this he rose Lanny Davis's answer does the SDN y have physical evidence in their hands that or is this still on Michael Cohen's word versus the president's word if I was trying to give you your answer Chuck the answer is number one the Trump team and mr. Giuliani have admitted that the money was paid number two there is physical and electronic evidence that the money was paid to miss Daniels from the Trump conduit who was mr. Cohen and it's all documented okay but that doesn't answer the question okay we know that the money was passed along the question is whether Trump had intended to avoid campaign finance law and that is not actually documented as what Lanny Davis seems to be saying so just because the money passed hands which we all assume happened and just because Trump told Cohen to solve the problem which we all assume happened doesn't mean that Trump actually had intent to violate campaign finance line now the great irony of the situation is that Hillary Clinton was allowed to get away with creating a had server and then destroying information on the private server supposedly because she didn't have intent that's pretty clear she actually did have intent to destroy information and violate the law but Trump probably didn't have intent here and so by the same standard he should probably not be criminally liable unless they have actual evidence that he knew that the law was being violated and he said I don't care go ahead and violate the law anyway it also doesn't help that Michael Cohen happens to be a particularly sleazy liar and everybody sort of knows it whether the newfound respect for Michael Cohen's honesty is sort of astonishing from folks on the left you can see that folks on the left even really don't believe Michael Khan they think he's a liar and a screwball Lanny Davis was on national television yesterday and on NBC News and he actually said that they'd open a legal defense fund for Michael Kony ask people to contribute and the audience started laughing at him it's really funny but could I just take one opportunity to remind everyone that Michael Cohen has suffered a tragic and difficult experience with his family he's without resources and we've set up a website called Michael Cohen truths calm that we're hoping that he will get some help from the American people so we can continue to tell the truth the audience is that I don't know if you're ready to donate Lanny but I we did check before we went to air and honest against the appropriate response by the way his Legal Defense Fund is raised like $150,000 it's raised a bunch of money 50,000 of those dollars apparently came from the CEO of NASCAR first time an odd reason that nobody can really explain so all of that is good stuff again the president has actually three pretty good defenses Michael Cohen is a liar okay fair enough Michael Cohen is a liar too I sleep with every one of them pay them off also a fairly good defense and defense number three I don't know what the hell I'm doing with regard to legal stuff he's my lawyer it's his job to know that stuff also a pretty good defense so all of the talk about Trump being necessarily legally on the ropes maybe he is maybe he's not I mean he's certainly more jeopardy than he was two days ago but that's not it's not indicative that this is sort of an open-and-shut case Bret Stephens of the New York Times is a whole thing today about how Trump should immediately be impeached the evidence seemed quite there yet of criminal action we all knew that Trump is is a man who lacks character in a lot of particular areas but that's not the same thing quite as criminal activity I'll get to the White House's response to all of this just a second plus and palm Anna for updates but first let's talk about the possibility of a natural disaster or god forbid some sort of situation that prevents you from having access to the grocery store it's important that you have some sort of emergency food supply available in your house I mean the government recommends the ought to have some emergency food in your house that you should have you should have water in your house and you ought to pay attention to that because you ought to be prepared you can trust my Patriot supply for that food storage so you'll be ready for earthquakes hurricanes long term power outages and more Hawaii's about to get hit by a hurricane apparently and you know you hope that the folks there are prepared for it you should be prepared as well every person in your household should have a two-week emergency food supply from my Patriot supply these kids are only 75 bucks right now they contain ninety two servings of breakfasts lunches and dinners take action call eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen or go to my special website prepare with been calm the food lasts up to twenty five years in storage meals compact and rugged slimline tote as well only seventy five bucks rest tonight knowing that you're prepared order your food kits at eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen or prepare with been calm that's eight eight eight eight o 31413 or prepare with been calm again eight eight eight eight o 31413 or prepare with been calm that ensures that you are essentially protected against the need for emergency food because you'll be prepared prepare with been calm go check it out right now so with all of this said the strongest defenses the president has are I get around I'm dumb about the law Michael Cohen's a liar right those are his strongest defenses his strongest defense is not I am by nature a truth teller that is not the president strongest defense because he's not okay be honest about this the president is not known for his veracity on a wide variety of issues he may be at root a truth teller on some matters political I think that's true but he also likes to fib a fair bit and so when Sarah Sanders got up Sarah Huckabee Sanders yesterday at the White House when she got up and she was asked whether Trump is lying she got very offended and it didn't play all that great the American people because so many people now look back at that him on Air Force One saying he knew nothing about these payments when in fact we now know he knew everything about this payment so has he lied look again I think that's an ridiculous accusation the president in this matter is done nothing wrong and there are no charges against him okay so he's done nothing wrong there no charges against him no charges against him it's a bad defense he never lies a bad defense is offensive to ask whether he lied he literally was on air fireman what that reporter says is true he was on Air Force One he was asked about paying off stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal and he said I had no knowledge that any of that stuff was happening that was not true okay so that's not his best defense again I've laid forth three separate defenses for the president all of which are fairly robust his best defense is not I can't be indicted and I never lie that's not his best defense but Sanders said repeatedly that Trump can't be indicted again he can't be that indicted probably because he's presidents of the United States but that's not a case that he's not guilty of a crime there are a bunch of other cases he's not guilty of a crime but the statement that he can't be indicted that's like saying well I you know I was acquitted on a murder charge and then it turns out actually murdered the person I can't be tried again because of double jeopardy well that's true that is legally true it also doesn't mean that you didn't necessarily murder the person hears like OJ Simpson clearly murdered Nicole Simpson he was acquitted and he can't be retried under double jeopardy if somebody were to ask him Oh J are you in a sense of killing your wife and he said can't be tried again you might assume well maybe he's a little bit guilty here is Sarah Huckabee Sanders though saying the president is innocent because he can't be indicted which is which is again legally not tenable as the president said we've stated many times he did nothing wrong there are no charges against him as the president has stated on numerous occasions he did nothing wrong there are no charges against him in this the president in this matter is done nothing wrong and there are no charges against him what the president has stated a number of times he did nothing wrong there are no charges against him he just kept saying this over and over right there's it he did nothing wrong there no charges against him he did nothing wrong he's a statement you know the you can say doesn't something morally wrong but he did nothing legally wrong would be the end of the case there are no charges against him is not part of the case there are no charges against him because he's the president of the United States and you cannot under federal law have a federal law enforcement agency indict a sitting president of the United States okay meanwhile we have up to on the Paul Manafort case so president Trump has come out very strongly in favor of Paul Mann afford he's defended Paul Manafort we're gonna get two presidents Trump response to all of this in just one second because he's been very prolific on Twitter and then he did a very long interview this morning on Fox and Friends as well and he talked to Ainsley Earhardt yesterday but the update on Paul Manafort is that a lot of people on the right have been saying that poem anna fort was railroaded and the case that they're making is that because he was acquitted or because of the jury hang did he wasn't acquitted he was the jury the jury hung on ten separate charges that this means that he was innocent of those charges and the whole thing is some sort of witch-hunt he was convicted on a charges one of the jurors was on Fox News last night with shannon bream she's a trump supporter she explained that basically there was one person in the room who made it a hung jury as opposed to everybody so basically if it not been from one juror he would been convicted on all accounts here's the juror explaining okay how close I want to know did this jury come to convicting Paul Manafort on all 18 counts by one that was one holdout the person a female juror was we all tried to convince her to look at the paper trail we laid it out in front of her again and again and she still said that she had a reasonable doubt and that's the way the jury work okay so the idea that this was just all the witch hunts again they're a bunch of Trump supporters on that jury and manifold was convicted on eight counts anyway so it's not the witch hunt if there is a witch hunt the witch hunt would have to do a lot more with the Muller investigation looking a Russian collusion but it would have nothing to do with Paul Manafort being guilty of stuff Paul manna for it was guilty of stuff end of story and when people say you know if the Special Counsel dug into you you would find something my answer would be well depends on what he finds if he finds that I was actively taking money from a foreign government in order to manipulate the American political process which is sort of what manna fort was doing prior to the election had nothing to do with Trump then that's a crime you know there's not say that the government should be able to go through everybody's books at will but he was convicted of eight federal felonies and would have been convicted of another ten if there hadn't been one holdout on the jury so let's reserve the witch hunt language for actual witch hunts let's not reserved the witch hunt which for when there's actually a lady running around in an actual witch's hat riding a broom and casting curses by killing cats well how about that how about we saved the witch hunt language for you no actual witch hunts Ainsley Earhardt k-much said the Trump is actually considering pardoning mana for Trump has been very warm toward mana Ford he says that mana fort is great guy because he didn't squeal which again doesn't make the president sound particularly innocent the president is his own worst advocate when it comes to matters legal here Ainsley Ainsley Earhardt came out and she said the Trump is considering pardoning Paul mana fortune then walked that back a little bit ari fleischer tweeted out he said if Trump pardons mana for then it might be worth considering impeachment he says I don't care for Trump's style he can be too offensive and divisive fleischer of course was press secretary under george w bush I like many of his policies if he fires mullah or pardons mana for I consider impeachment but nothing so far merits impeachment the remedy for those who can't stand him is political beat him in 2020 if you can I think so far ari fleischer is basically correct so all of the talk about palm anna fort it amounts to nothing I'm just puzzled as to why the president continues to defend him meanwhile the state of New York is looking at going after president Trump as well this poses a significant serious difficulty for the president because the president can be indicted on state charges so if you commit a murder as president of the United States there is nothing in the Constitution that forbids a state prosecutor from bringing you up on violation of state law the reason the president can be indicted under federal law is because the president controls the federal executive branch but the President does not control state law which is why the president can't for example pardon state crimes right he can't pardon a state murderer for example well New York State investigators have now subpoenaed Michael Cohen the president's former personal lawyer according to state officials as part of a probe into the Donald J Trump foundation they have a lot of evidence that the Donald J Trump foundation was basically being used as a pass-through for Trump to pay personal expenses it's not a criminal matter yet right the tax department in New York doesn't have the jurisdiction to pursue criminal charges but it's discovered information valuable to the investigation of the Trump foundation it would then be referred to the New York State Attorney General I have very little doubt that the New York Attorney General would have very little trouble trying to pursue a criminal investigation into president Trump Barbara Underwood hates President Trump with a passion of a thousand burning sons so you could see is a state prosecution against the president and he is not in fact immune to state prosecution under federal law so this is a continuing serious problem for the president it's you know it would be great if we'd have to deal with any of this stuff we'll have to deal with the charges they come and evaluate them as they come now in a second we're going to get to the president's response to all of this some of which is good some of which is bad most of which is kind of bad but we'll get to that in just second first let's talk about your suit so look dudes you want to look like James Bond okay you want to be wearing a tailored suit you want to look like you are dressed to the nines every time you put

special discount go check it out right now ok so president Trump has responded to all this in a variety of ways so yesterday he was on with Ainsley Earhardt over at Fox News and he said I paid for stormy Daniels so remember this is a guy who said that he didn't even know about the stormy Daniels pay off now he is saying that he paid for stormy Daniels the case in favor of him saying this is that he doesn't think he violated federal finance law he didn't know his violation of federal finance law he still goes who knows a violation of federal finance laws how can you say he had intent to violate federal finance law that's the charitable reading the unshared is that he just admitted to a federal crime because if he personally paid for a campaign expenditure and admitted to it then he just admitted to a federal crime on national television this is why you should let your lawyers do the talking mr. president here is the President of the United States talking to Ainsley Earhardt did you know about the payments later on I knew later on but you have to understand anything what he did and they weren't taken out of campaign finance that's a big thing that's a much bigger thing did they come out of the campaign they didn't come out of the campaign they came from me and I tweeted about it you know I put I don't know if you know but I tweeted about the payments but they didn't come out of campaign in fact my first question when I heard about it was did they come out of the campaign okay so it's a this is not a smart line of attack because if in fact he knew that the money was going to be used to pay off stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in violation of federal campaign finance law then him saying I signed it personally is in fact the crime if it's a campaign expenditure it's supposed to come from campaign funding and if he wants to spend on his own behalf he's supposed to report it so that's not particularly great and the president also decided that it would be worthwhile to tweet out about Michael Cohen again today so he tweeted out the only thing I have done wrong is to win an election that was expected to be won by a crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats the problem is they forgot to campaign in numerous states so fact check 3/4 true half true so it is true that if he had not won none of this would be an issue it is also true that the media are very pissed and that he won it is not really super true that the only thing he did wrong was to win the election it turns out that shipping women not your wife and then paying them hundreds of thousands of dollars to shut up in advance of an election it doesn't go in like the book of virtues it's probably not like the best thing to do but when it but you know the he's right that the media are treating this in a way differently than they would treat a Democrat certainly that wasn't the end of it though the president also did an interview this morning on on Fox News it was a fairly lengthy interview and he talked about a wide variety of topics one of the things that he talked about is Michael Cohen flipping on him and he makes a comment that again this is why you let your lawyers do the talking mr. president let your lawyers are the talking mr. president my good he comes out and he says that when people flip flipping ought to be illegal right so getting somebody to testify in exchange for reduced sentence that should be illegal well for a law-and-order guy that's a real weird statement because every drug ring that has ever been ruled up has been rolled up on the basis of people pleading to lesser crimes in order for them to get some sort of advantage and then testify against their buddies right every single every single RICO case every single drug case half of criminal cases are based on flipping people so you can move up the chain right flipping people is a is a long honored tradition and the reason for that is because if you couldn't flip people if you couldn't offer them a reduced sentence or protection or some sort of concession why wouldn't they just go by omerta why wouldn't they just keep silent in order to maintain loyalty with the folks who they are afraid will kill them in prison or in order to maintain loyalty with the folks are gonna pay their family while they stay in jail for a longer period of time here's President Trump though saying that flipping people ought to be illegal this is just not smart it makes him look guilty even if he's not it's just okay here is make up stories this whole thing about flipping they call it I know all about flipping for 30 40 years I've been watching flippers everything's wonderful and then they get 10 years in jail and they they flip on whoever the next highest one is or as high as you can go it almost sort of be outlawed it's not fair what in the living hell I mean he sounds like John Gotti here yeah he should not be doing this right the fact is when the president says I'm watching us for 30 years okay so you can actually search his tweet history he is not once tweeted about flipping not once until now has he discuss flipping publicly not once as he said you know what this Criminal Procedure is really bad only when someone flips on him then all of a sudden flipping is really really really bad and presumably when it comes to cracking down on drug crimes or illegal immigration he's a very tough law and order president he doesn't care about flipping it's only flipping applies when it comes to him so I guess that the the we can all expect Republican support for the don't rat on people act of 2018 it's just not not good stuff then the president makes a separate case he says I shouldn't be impeached not because I'm innocent I shouldn't be impeached because if I did then the market would crash again oh yeah yeah yeah I'll tell you what if I ever got a piece I think the market would crash I think everybody would be very poor because without this thinking you would see you would see numbers that you wouldn't believe in reverse ok so yeah maybe that's true maybe that's not the fact is that after the impeachment Clinton the market continued to go up I think that the market really does not like uncertainty the market is so it's probably true that the market would take a hit the market took a hit a couple of days ago when all these revelations from Michael Cohen broke so yes the market doesn't like uncertainty would it adjust with President Mike Pence you know yeah sure I mean the answer is probably yes although a Trump impeachment would probably ding the market I don't think so Thalia wrong here I think the reason that it would zing the market is because the markets fear Democratic takeover of the House Senate and presidency and a massive upswing and regulation that would dampen the ability to invest right if they've people were afraid that Elizabeth Warren was gonna be the next president with a Democratic Congress then that might ding the market so Trump isn't entirely wrong here but again his strongest case here is I didn't do anything wrong he should just come out and say I don't know the law I didn't know the law to pretend I'm some sort of campaign finance expert is silly there's there's such ample defenses available to him but this is where the president's ego gets in the way of his own success now the president loves him some president I mean Donald Trump is a big fan of Donald Trump and because he's a big fan of Donald Trump he's never able to admit to things that we all know are true like the fact that he goes around sleeping with porn stars and paying them off like we all know that's true I'm not gonna pretend that he's a King David character when it comes to his character he's not and we all know that that was baked into the cake if he would just say that I think everybody would be like okay fine that's a plausible case that's what Bill Clinton basically did Bill Clinton basically says yeah that's what I do I'll go around sticking cigars and women that's what I'll do and everybody was like okay guess so yep that's that's accurate if the president just said that stuff he said listen I'm ignorant about the law and I pay off ladies everybody be like yeah kind of knew that already kinda knew that already that was already known but instead the president keeps saying that he's a legal expert on things that he's been talking about flipping for 30 years he has never once talked about flipping the weekend fine and how do you know that the president is a little bit egotistic because here's what he was asked to grade his presidency so far I will give you three guesses how he graded his presidency so far three guesses I don't think it's going to take three guesses for you so I give myself an A+ I don't think any president has ever done what I've done in this short we haven't even been two years biggest tax cuts in history I would say I would honestly give myself an A+ and so would many other people yes many other people who worked for you and or in Congress and want to get things done with you listen I've been very positive about the president's policy I've given him an a-minus when it comes to his executive policy I have given him like a C+ when it comes to legislative policy maybe a b-minus and when it comes to rhetoric keys a dear enough I mean that's just the way that it is and people may disagree with that although I can assure you there are a lot of folks in the administration who basically agree with that assessment but the fact that the president gives himself an A+ ego is a killer okay it's true for you it's true for me anybody who gets too over their skis on ego who never reflects for a second and thinks maybe there's something I'm bad at one of the worst things you can do in life is overestimate your own skillset or suggest that you have a skill set where you have none there's certain things I'm just bad at okay I'm not the world's most athletic human right there I'm not I'm good at math but I'm not great at math right there are certain things I just don't know a lot about if I don't admit that stuff you get yourself in real trouble and that's particularly true when you are talking about matters legal yeah there are lawyers for a reason who go to law school and spend years practicing it is not a coincidence that President Trump has fired basically everywhere he's ever worked with at a certain point when you look at a client and every one of their lawyers has failed you have to think maybe it's not the lawyers maybe it's the client so the President of the United States may having making real trouble for himself he didn't stop there we get to some more of his comments in just a second first let's talk about bravo company manufacturing when the founders crafted the constitution the first thing they did was to make sacred the rights of the individual to share their ideas without limitation by the government and to protect that they created the second amendment the second enumerated right the right of the population to protect that speech and their rights with force and that is why I am a big Second Amendment supporter the same thing holds true for the folks at Bravo company manufacturing Bravo Company manufacturing was started in a garage by a marine vet more than two decades ago to build profession great product that meets combat standards BCM believes the same level of protection should be provided to every American as long as you're a law-abiding citizen who wants to protect your rights BCM is not a supporting arms company they design engineer and manufacture life-saving equipment this isn't about hunting it's not about going to the range it's about will this thing function if god forbid there's somebody in your house trying to hurt you or if you are in in the midst of a tyrannical government rise which I know I know folks on the Left likes you discount this until Donald Trump is president but one of the reasons we don't have a tyrannical government is particularly the threat of a population that is armed BCM wants to make weapons that assume each rifle leaving their shop will be used in a life-or-death situation by a responsible citizen law enforcement officer or a soldier overseas each component of a BCM rifle is hand assembled and tested by Americans to a life-saving standard they

conservative podcast in the nation so the president continues to defend Paul Manafort again not he I don't see why Paul Manafort was convicted of a bunch of stuff that had nothing to do with Trump now the cynical reason he'd protect Paul Manafort is because he's afraid that if he doesn't talk about pub pub Paul Manafort is great Paul Manafort flips to but the non cynical reason is that he just thinks anybody in his orbit who's targeted as targeted unfairly in any case the president is not his own best advocate here I know that a lot of his fans think that he's always his own best advocate but that is just not true and it's not true on matters with regard to with regard to law so you know I would hope that the president would would kind of leave off here and let his lawyers do the rest meanwhile the media are just champing at the bit over this Chuck Todd over at NBC you know in doing some real journalism in being very objective here he says that Paul Ryan should drop impeachment papers because I remember when all of the members of the media were calling on Democrats to go along with impeachment of President Clinton for committing actual perjury while he was presidents of the United States oh no wait that didn't happen at all I also don't remember calls for impeachment of President Obama over the IRS scandal or Benghazi or the Fast & Furious scandal or any of the other scandals that occurred during the during the Obama administration you wanna read about all those scandals I wrote an entire book on them it's called the the People vs Barack Obama so go check that out but Chuck Todd says Paul Ryan should start drawing up impeachment papers now Ryan's retiring I think he actually could do the party a favor and if you just start the procedure in the House Judiciary Committee you give some home you give some place for Republicans getting nervous to say hey you know what let's start an investigation and we'll go from there okay how about everybody just saying we won't obstruct the investigation and there's already investigation going on the mother investigation continues and Republicans have already said that if it's not obstruct if it's obstructed it's gonna be a problem okay the same thing holds true with regard to the SD NY investigation I assume but the idea that Republicans are gonna start impeachment proceedings based on the information that we have now it's a little early Chuck Todd also let's be real about what impeachment is hey impeachment is a political remedy impeachment is not a legal remedy that's not how it was originally conceived the founders thought that impeachment was going to be a legal remedy that Congress would use impeachment in order to check the executive branch in reality impeachment has been used extraordinarily like people in politics tend to want elections to provide the referendum on the sitting president of the United States they don't tend to want to oust people even for legal violations because they'd rather have the people taken on their own backs to get rid of a particular president there have only been three impeachment proceedings in America's history with regard to presidents one was Andrew Johnson impeached in the house not convicted in the Senate Bill Clinton impeached in the house not convicted in the Senate and Richard Nixon impeachment proceedings never really got started because Nixon knew he would be impeached and he resigned so the sudden the sudden shift toward we have to have a bipartisan view of impeachment is kind of ridiculous coming from the same media that thought it was absolutely absurd for Republicans to try to impeach President Clinton back in 1998 Elizabeth Warren though understands this is where the heart of the base is she is probably one of the frontrunners for the 2020 nomination among Democrats and she said on CNN that she is not nervous to bring up the topic of impeachment of course why would she be she's from Massachusetts the chances that she meets any sort of resistance here aren't slim and none I'm not nervous I just want to be effective and the way that any of us are effective is to say let's get all of the evidence let's get all of the pieces out there protect Robert Muller let him finish his investigation let him make a full and fair report to all of the American people okay so what exactly are Democrats looking for in this whole proceeding what they're really looking for is an excuse to obstruct Trump's agenda we all know this Kamala Harris who's our execrable senator I've been using that word a lot because a lot of execrable people lately but Kamala Harris is our execrable senator here in the state of California she came out and she says you know because Trump is now basically an unindicted co-conspirator which he is not I mean that's an actual legal term that is not used in the indictment of Michael Cohen because he's an indicted unindicted co-conspirator says Kamala Harris we should not move forward on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court this does not follow let's say John Donald Trump or remove tomorrow let's say Donald Trump resigned tomorrow who would become president it wouldn't be Kamala Harris when me Hillary Clinton it would be Mike Pence would then move full full scale forward on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh so this is just stupidity but it demonstrates that the real the real force behind impeachment has much more to do with obstructing the President's agenda than with legal ire at the president's miss action here even before this happened there was no that the process was horribly flawed a court of the United States of America has accepted a guilty plea from someone who was the lawyer for the President of the United States and that person in pleading guilty basically made very clear that it was the then candidate and now the president of the United States who directed him to commit a crime this is a serious matter yeah this is I love I love the faux seriousness from Kamala Harris who was one of the worst attorney generals in the history of the state of California refusing to enforce the law enforcing what wasn't appropriate and now she's of course the senator who's going to use this this sort of supposed legal ire to go after president Trump there there's a fair bit of hypocrisy on this yeah they're gonna hold up Brett Kavanaugh over Trump come on come on we all know what this is really about we are all very well aware of what this is all really about okay meanwhile the president is getting himself in I think hot water from the left but I don't think appropriately because yesterday he tweeted out that he wanted to look into the situation in South Africa regarding land seizures so for folks who have not been following the situation in South Africa because we don't tend to follow foreign policy that much in the United States what's been happening is that the South African government which is dominated by the left has decided that they want to seize the land of white farmers in recompense for apartheid apartheid ended in 1994 I believe under the the Nelson Mandela it was it started to collapse already in the late 80s and then it was formally ended in in 94 by Mandela in any case the I don't want to get the the history of that wrong so I'm actually going to look that up right now so in an in any case the South African government decides yeah I mean that's that's right in April 27 1994 is when it was formally ended in any case the President of the United States is commenting on the fact that the South African government now wants to seize land that is owned by white folks in South Africa and redistributed this is bad policy for South Africa it's particularly bad policy because it is undermining the rule of law and the real problems in South Africa have very little to do with white land ownership and they have a lot more to do with the fact that rule of law has collapsed in South Africa the crime rates are extraordinarily high they've an unemployment twenty-eight percent they've significantly high inflation they have water crisis that's been ongoing for years at this point is a distraction from the government of South Africa to the people of South Africa on a racial basis and it is true that apartheid was evil and it has carried over into into land ownership today but the idea that you can just seize property from white landowners and not undermine the rule of law which undermines foreign investment and the capacity to trust in your ability to own private property in South Africa is of course very silly so Trump tweeted out I've as Secretary of State Pompeyo to closely study the South Africa land and farm teachers and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers South African government is now seizing land from white farmers Tucker Carlson Fox News so he was watching Fox News last night and he decided this was gonna drive policy he's not wrong about the land expropriate expropriations the left which is going nuts over this suggesting that this is racial it's racially motivated the United States if it were the reverse if you were black landowners who are having their land seized by white people the president would certainly have a right to intervene and the same is true here and there's already been talk about the United States government getting active on the international stage over all of this the Cato Institute has issued a statement regarding the dire consequences awaiting South Africa should due process fail land expropriation without compensation what's happening there as the government is not even saying that they're going to pay people for their land they're basically just grabbing land without even recompense which is which is a crazy crazy policy here is is some audio of the the leader of South Africa the the prime minister of South Africa his his name is Rama foes up talking about this land expropriation on Tuesday South Africans through their publicly elected representatives in Parliament voted overwhelmingly in support of the motion to accelerate equitable land redistribution through expropriation of land without compensation okay that's a crazy policy there's a Cyril Ramaphosa the reason he's doing this is because he's being outflanked by radicals the ruling African National Congress amended but supported the motion to actually expropriate land without any sort of compensation he's being outflanked by the radical left economic freedom fighters these are folks who wear red berets like that illegitimate communists whose leader Julius Malema told the country's parliament we must ensure that we restore the dignity of our people without compensating the criminals who stole our land so they're not going to pay people now you may think that the people who own the land committed a crime you'd actually have to look at which people owning the land committed the crimes maybe that's true maybe that's not but to remove land from people without actually paying them on the governmental level especially when it wouldn't cost all that much money to pay them off and make them leave to do that undermines rule of law in South Africa and the president isn't wrong to point that out now there's been a lot of focus on so-called farmers in South Africa a lot of these farms aren't owned by white folks and the murder rate on these farms is is high but the murder rate across South Africa is particularly high the statistics are very much in doubt as to whether there is a higher rate of targeted killing of whites in South Africa than blacks in South Africa the most violent areas of South Africa include mass killing of or massive killing anyway now black folks crime rates are very high over there but to suggest the president has no place in saying anything about this and that he's only doing this because he's a racist as so many on the Left are saying that is uh that that's that's pretty silly that's that's I think an overstatement by the media which we are getting used to in large scale okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like my sister actually recommended this show to me it's on Netflix it's called I am a killer and to look inside death row it's a documentary series so they profile a bunch of murder cases and they talk to folks who are on death row it's it's kind of fascinating because it is fairly objective it tries to take all sides of a particular issue it will talk to the victims of the killing it will talk to the killer they'll talk to the family of the killer and the law enforcement officers and prosecutors it's as good a piece of journalism on this stuff as I've seen him only a couple of episodes in but so far I'm a fan the shows I'm a killer and here's a little bit of the trailer I was convicted for capital murder I was convicted of capital murder and I was sentenced to death I did something so heinous I just fired a shot I strike them with the axe started stabbing let me tie you up I'm gonna kill you oh I mean it it's it's definitely well done it's not it's not the fastest moving thing but it's definitely a well done seriously you should go check that out it's well worth saying other things that I like so the President of the United States has been making an issue out of the Mali Tibbets case the Mali Tibbets case twenty-year-old Iowan girl who was abducted and murdered by an illegal immigrant and president Trump issued comments yesterday a lot of folks were saying that President Trump was doing this to distract from all the Coens stuff the reality is that Trump would have done this in any case for I mean he did this during the campaign repeatedly with Kate Steinle over in San Francisco so this is this is nothing new here's President Trump commenting on it it's one of the reasons why President Trump continues to retain popularity is because the contrast between Trump and the left on issues like this is pretty astonishing Mali Tibbets an incredible young woman is now permanently separated from her family a person came in from Mexico illegally and killed her we need the wall we need our immigration laws changed the Democrats will never give them and the wall is being built we've started it but we also need the funding for this year's building of the wall so to the family of Mali Tibbets all I can say is God bless you this is why if President Ron would just leave to his lawyers the rest of the stuff and he campaigned on this stuff you'd actually be doing much better in the polls and I think that yeah he'd be doing well especially when you contrast this with the with the sort of idiocy of a lot of folks on the Left Symone Sanders he's a commentator over at CNN here's what she had to tweet a tamale Tibbets matter she tweeted Mali Tibbets was murdered because she told the man to leave her alone while she was jogging her murderer happens to be undocumented this isn't about border security this is about toxic masculinity Mali Tibbets lost her life because a man couldn't take her saying no full stop well I think it's fair to say that when a man kills a woman that does counts as toxic masculinity I think it probably counts as just toxic evil in any case and it turns out the vast majority of murders in the United States are committed by men so I don't think that's totally wrong but to say that it has nothing to do with undo being undocumented is silly he shouldn't be in the country the question is how you stop that if Simone Sanders has a good answer as to how to stop toxic masculinity like men from killing women in general that is better than don't let evil men into the country illegally I'd like to hear it but this is sort of the problem with a lot of folks on the Left they will say things like we have a problem the problem is toxic masculinity and it's out there in the air somewhere I'm not gonna actually provide a solution to that the solution is sort of you know like to regen dur our children the solution is to pretend that masculinity is inherently bad right and then those of us say well you know the other thing we could do is just not let this piece of crap in the country shake no we got to talk about toxic masculinity you wonder why folks are resounding to President Trump even still that is the reason what I mean while some things that I hate speaking of the attempt to undermine basic truths there's this video that has now been I've now been made aware of it's it's a video that is promoted at of all places the Huffington Post because this is the repository for all stupidity in the United States it's a video of a trans man which is to say a woman who believes that she is a man her name is Cass bliss and she detailed that Huffington Post what it's like to get your period when you're not a woman which as a man I would say is pretty weird because you need a uterus which makes you a woman bliss is a non-binary trans educator and she first went viral with her bleeding well trans campaign in 2017 to prove the biologically impossible claim that men have periods to she recently created a music video discussing the struggles of having your period while not identifying his woman in a quest for menstrual equity so here is here's the song cut by a woman who believes she is a man who says that men have periods and yes it's weird and yes if this is your solution to toxic masculinity I'm not going to take you seriously though I'm not a woman she is building right outside Jarno Trulli let me bleed let me play let me read let me play so I'm not a big with our gendered wombs of wisdom let us plead itself first of all not a huge Beatles fan in general but if you're going to destroy the Beatles this way I feel bad for the Beatles now and and this person is saying that we can't have we can't have tampons anymore because tampons are gendered when you go to the when you go to the store they're all they're like pink and stuff instead what they should be as they should be like a manly blue like manly blue tampons very important and and we should have tampons in the men's bathroom also which would be weird since men don't have uterus but the conflation of sex with gender is is one of the most ridiculous aspects of the sort of trans rights agenda this bizarre notion that sex and gender are different but then we will conflate them again so sex is your biology you are biologically male but your gender is the ORA gendered female but then when it comes to going to the bathroom we are going to treat your gender as your sex you are a biological female even though you're a biological male none of this makes any sense you wonder why folks are confused and find this just a there's an article yesterday was really amazing there's an article about Blaire white who's a trans woman meaning a man who believes that he is a woman or who feels like a woman on the inside or whatever and Blaire is a nice person I've been on Blairs show on YouTube we just discussed exactly this issue and the yahoo news article about Blaire white described our conversation and said that I was anti the trans community I don't even know what that means if by anti the trans community you mean I am NOT going to suggest that you are a member of the of the sex to which you claim membership then okay if you mean that I don't want you to have all the rights of a normal human being in the United States then of course that's not true of course I think that trans people should be able to do anything that non trans people should be able to do in the United States but no one in the united states gets to redefine objective biological terms and then expect me to go along with the x that's not a thing that is going to happen but I guess it again just this idea that you are anti a person because you're anti a perspective is a conflation that is intellectually dishonest okay other things that I hate - Jimmy Kimmel has now made clear for the one hundred and seventy fifth time that he doesn't want to appeal to Trump fans he says I don't think that world exists anymore he says that he is not gonna bother with with trying to appease all of these folks he says I don't think you can look at things in that way he says that the world doesn't exist anymore where he can appeal to of a wide variety of people he was interview by The Daily Beast the daily be said in terms of the effect of politics on your own ratings I know you said if people who disagreed with you don't want to watch you don't particularly care has that ever been an issue at ABC he said I said he and he replied maybe I shouldn't have said I don't care I don't care enough to change what I'm doing it's probably a more explicit explanation I'm sure ABC would love it if my show up heeled to everyone but I don't think that world exists anymore and I'm not comfortable in it I don't really see any but any other path I also think one of the biggest mistakes you can make as a performer is trying to guess what your audience wants I think you need to do what you think is right and hope that works out well I agree with that I also think that what the audience expects from a comedian is to be funny and not to be a crusader for their politics that is not the same thing as if you just want to be a political person who happens to be funny there is a difference there is a difference I think the media are gonna continue to fragment so long as people don't understand which Lane they are in are you a comedian or are you're a political guru pick one pick one you can be a political guru who's funny that's fine there are plenty of those but if you're going to be a comedian theoretically you should be making comedy about everybody which is not what folks like Jimmy Kimmel are doing it's alienating a lot of the audience and it's causing that audience to react politically to cultural flashpoints like Kimmel already we will be back here
