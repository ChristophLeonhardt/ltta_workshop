underneath me when I am sleeping at home all right so lot in the news obviously the media are going absolutely apoplectic over the new James Comey book which is supposedly filled with bombshells there's only one problem there are no bombshells in former FBI director james comey 'he's new book first of all James called me called this thing a higher loyalty loyalty to like the money because if this was all stuff of vital public import then why exactly did he wait a year and a book contract before coming out with it if he wants to demonstrate that he really is not in it for the cash that he's really in it because he just wants to tell the truth then he likes stormy Daniels could just give up the money he's not gonna be doing that anytime soon and the media I mean they are so over the moon about this book but they're really trying to make mountains out of not even mole hills I mean the stories in this book are nothing it's all James commis whiney opinions Chris Wallace I think said up on Fox News he said this book is incredibly big and it really is and if you look at this book and you read the segments from it it's really just nasty and petty and stupid that's at least what I'm getting from it because I'm not seeing any revelations here I'm not seeing anything that says to me wow this is something I didn't know remember James Comey was fired because President Trump wanted him to clear him in the Russia investigation publicly and James Comey said you're not being investigated and Trump said we'll say that publicly and Comey said no and Trump said fine you're fired all right that's exactly what happened and now we're supposed to believe that something deep in nefarious happened Comey went on Capitol Hill he testified that Trump had obstructed his Russia investigation in any way Trump just got rid of him because Trump apparently was unhappy with him that Comey would not publicly say the truth which is that Trump was not the target of the investigation or even a subject of the investigation at the time well here are some of the revelations that the media are just going nuts over and it's wall-to-wall coverage of James Comey book because this was a preset agenda there's a general point here to be made about the media that I think is relevant for people to understand over the last at least 15 to 20 years most of my life in in politics and that is the media are trying to portray it right now as though we live in a trump centric universe and then we live in this this universe where everything revolves around Trump every story has to be refracted through the prism of Trump that's not true okay we actually live in a heliocentric universe but the Helios is not Trump the Helios is the media everything is about the media all stories are refracted through the prism of the media Trump is refracted through the prism of the media Trump is a satellite orbiting the media right the media are they are the grand arbiters of what it is that you see and what it is that you hear and all of the politicians are speaking to against or through the media and this has never been clearer than it is with regard to how they are treating the economy stuff because the Comey stuff is not even a blip okay this book is not even a blip and this is not me coming at it from a he's a political hack and all this kind of this is just like as objective as I can be about this if there been a bombshell in here I would been happy to report it to you there is nothing his Robert De Niro has Al Capone in the Untouchables he's got nothing there there's nothing here nothing zero things he says let's go through some of these supposed and revelations in here first of all he's at an interview with George Stephanopoulos it's supposed to air on Sunday and here are some of the grand revelations again this is all petty nonsense here's Stephanopoulos with Komi no graphic did you get I think as graphic as I needed to be I started tell him about the allegation was that he had been involved with prostitutes in a hotel in Moscow in 2013 during a visit for the Miss Universe pageant and that the Russians had filmed the episode and he interrupted very defensively and started talking about it you know do I look like a guy who needs hookers and I assumed he was asking that rhetorically I didn't answer that and I just moved on and explained sir I'm not saying that we credit this not saying we believe it we just thought it very important that you know did you tell him you thought it wasn't true or you didn't know if it was true or not I never said I don't believe it because I couldn't say one way or another how weird was that breathing really weird I was almost an out-of-body experience for me I was floating above myself looking down saying you're sitting here briefing the incoming president United States about prostitutes in Moscow says he may want me to investigate it to prove that it didn't happen and then he says something that distracted me because he said you know if there's even a 1% chance my wife thinks that's true that's terrible and I and I remember thinking how could your wife think there's a 1% chance you're with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow I'm a flawed human being but there's literally zero chance that my wife would think that was true so what kind of marriage to what kind of man is your wife think there's only a 99 percent chance you didn't do that and I said to him sir when he started talking about it I may order you to investigate that I said sir that's up to you but you'd want to be careful about that because it might create a narrative that were investigating you personally and second it's very difficult to prove something didn't happen did you believe his denial honestly I never thought these words would come out of my mouth but I don't know whether the current president knighted States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013 it's possible okay that is such a this is such nonsense stupidity okay there's no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the Donald Trump was having prostitutes pee on him in Moscow honest to god if the president wanted to the president and have to pay anyone to pee on him he's got the media doing it to him full-time for free right here George Stephanopoulos is peeing on him okay doesn't need Russian prostitutes doing it for him but James Comey sitting there and going you know it's just insane that the President of the United States would ask me to investigate this thing and then in the same breath like literally in the same sentence saying I don't know if it's true though I mean it's possible well if it's possible then what are you complaining about him saying he wants it investigated to get to the bottom of it like you think it's sort of true and you're not the only one like Seth Meyers goes on TV last night and he says well clearly if Trump was asking about it then probably Trump was peed on by Russian prostitutes which doesn't make any sense at all but it's amazing the entire media that went nuts over the P tape for literally months is now deeply concerned that Donald Trump wanted that investigated and himself cleared of it because how could he how could he do such a thing well maybe it's because you guys kept saying P tape over and over for weeks probably it's that I hear Seth Meyers making a fool of himself oh my god it's real if you knew for a fact that P tape definitely didn't exist that's like me saying can you make sure there isn't a tape of me in 1994 doing Thunder Road to karaoke and then barfing and then slipping on the barf and farting okay this is so stupid again if President Trump actually thought you were guilty of this would he want the FBI looking into it the logic doesn't even make any sort of basic sense but because the media are invested in making Trump into a mockery they're going to say P tape over and over and over and over again until all this is over Comey of course makes a bunch of other allegations in the book and again he talked the Stephanopoulos about this here's some more of what he had to say to George Stephanopoulos in his big primetime interview that's coming on Sunday whew it's earth-shattering except for the fact that all this is really about as Nate silver put it not a man of the right right Nate silver says his book shouldn't be called the higher loyalty it should be called the higher royalty here is a year's James Comey talking with Stephanopoulos as an electrons first question was to confirm that it had no impact on the election and then the conversation to my surprise moved into a PR conversation about how the Trump team would position this and what they could say about this they actually started talking about drafting a press release with us still sitting there and the reason that was so striking to me is that that's just not done that the intelligence community does intelligence the White House does PR and spin okay so are we supposed to believe that it's like a big deal that Trump doesn't know how government works congratulations he doesn't know how government works Wow you've solved the Rubik's Cube here you solved the riddle President Trump is not an expert on how the government works yep shocker to everyone I'm sure everyone involved is just sitting around with their draw slack to the floor what utter nonsense and silliness by the way Comey said that he did not brief President Trump on the fact that this Fusion GPS dossier was originally funded by Democratic Hilary Club by Democrats and Hillary Clinton he didn't reveal that to Trump because presumably he didn't want Trump tweeting that out that if he had known that the dossier was funded by the Democrats he just would have said the dossier was funded by the Democrats and then that would have immediately undercut the credibility of the dossier so he said he didn't think it was relevant for Trump to know that okay so it's relevant for Trump to know about stupid allegations with no evidence to back them about a P tape with Russians peeing on each other and him but it's deep but it's not important at all for Trump to know that those allegations were being compiled by a firm being paid by Hillary Clinton completely irrelevant yeah no commis not a political actor at all okay here are some of the other allegations that Comey makes in the book that are supposed to be earth-shattering so he says that he says that he received a call from John Kelly who's then the head of the Department of Homeland Security and now the White House chief of staff and Kelly was quote-unquote emotional over how Comey was fired Comey writes that Kelly was sick about the situation and intended to quit in protest well he didn't did he he's still around is he not he is the White House chief of staff so apparently who cares also I love this a couple other bombshells apparently Comey ridicules Trump for being shorter than he anticipated and described Trump is having half white the bright white half moons beneath his eyes he also argued that Trump's ties were too long according to the Associated Press and suggested the one he shook Trump's hand he evaluated his hand size he said they might have been a little bit small but no real not not that much smaller than normal yeah that's not petty and ridiculous that's not petty and silly no this is deep stuff that we all have to know about it James Comey is a man of honor he's a man of deep honor sure he blew the Hillary investigation sure he botched everything he touched since May that's basically like January 2016 but no he's a man of honor don't you understand he's not out there grandstanding you know getting million-dollar advances and then going on national TV to talk about Trump's hand sighs no no he is a man of deep and abiding respect and honor for institutions now there are a couple of things in this book that are worth discussing and I'll discuss them in just a second first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at the u.s. CCA so attention gun-owners I have a very big announcement that you're not gonna want to miss do you want a brand new gotten for free well you're in luck because the u.s.

citizens who are law-abiding make the country a better place and you can be one of them go to defend my family now one calm right now okay so other revelations in the James Comey book include this one this is just what a what a self-serving a sad-sack James Comey is my goodness okay this is a legit quote from the book Comey writes that Obama President Obama sat alone with him in the Oval Office in late November and told him quote I picked you to be FBI director because of your integrity and your ability I want you to know that nothing buffett has happened in the last year to change my view on the verge of tears Comey told Obama boy were those words I needed to hear I'm just trying to do the right thing I know Obama said I know oh my God really really seeing that Ohama said that I'm a good guy he said I'm a good guy I was I'm I almost cried when he said I was a good guy yeah okay other things that are hilarious in this book so apparently Comey says in the book that he would that when he revealed late in the election right ten days before the election that Hillary Clinton they were reopening the email investigation because Hillary's emails were found on the computer of the of the accused child pornographer Anthony Weiner that when that happened Comey considered the polling data or he might have considered the polling data you thought Hillary was so far ahead it won't matter if I reveal this stuff now but if you had thought that the election really close maybe would have held until after the election yeah that this is really a guy who's just full-on credible I have to say he was playing one of the great scams I have ever seen I mean this is a usual suspect level scam hey this is this is a the sting level scam it's an amazing scam how good is this scam James Comey may have cost Hillary Clinton the election hey James Comey and his late breaking news in the election might have cost Hillary Clinton the presidency and now the only people who love him are the people who voted for Hillary Clinton that is an unbelievable scam I mean boy oh boy if I could have thought of that one cost Hillary the election and then turn on Trump and get all of the people who hated you to buy your book and declare you the most honest man in politics what a beautiful scam that is so apparently he also said in the book that as a prosecutor he used to tell juries trying to evaluate a witness that you can't cherry-pick you can't say things like he's saying that's about Trump I like these things he said but on this he's a dirty rotten liar you got to take it all together so you got a rap Trump up into a ball and then take it all at face value okay then why didn't you that with Hillary Clinton why did you pick and choose which facts you were to go over about Hillary Clinton why is that a thing by the way there is a serious question as to whether James Comey has violated his FBI review rules right he's actually f but there are prohibited disclosures by the FBI FBI employees shall not disclose information that relates to the substantive merits of any ongoing or open investigation or case so all of the said James Comey may still be in violation of law so we'll have to see how all of that shakes out well President Trump has now responded to James Comey and it is indeed hilarious so here's President Trump's response he tweeted out a couple of things about James Comey and if you just think that America you know somehow we ended up in the alternative reality where Biff actually used the sports book to bet on games and then married Marty McFly's mom and somehow we ended up in that timeline you would probably would not be wrong because I mean this is a real thing that is happening right now today okay the President of the United States tweeted this out first of all you have the former FBI director accusing the President of the United States of possibly having been peed on by Russian prostitutes even though he has no evidence of it and then jabbering ridiculously about the president's hand sighs and then you got the president so the president sitting around the Oval Office and mr. president just just look commis imploding okay just let him implode it's fine everything's good just stop just that but no president Trump has his head so here's the president wrote pretty fantastic Jim's coming is a proven liquor and the liar virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did until he was in fact fired he leaked classified information for which he should be prosecuted he lied to Congress under oath he is a weak and untruthful slimeball who was as time has proven a terrible director of the FBI his handling of the crooked Hillary Clinton case capital C and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst batch jobs of history it was my great honor to fire James Comey boom roasted they didn't actually say boom roasted but he probably should have because I mean come on first of all I'd slimeball untruthful slime balls pretty good slimeball and Pete ape is gonna be a fantastic morning show somewhere it's gonna be like welcome to the morning show with slimeball and Pete ape it's just this is our politics now president the United States being accused of Pete Apes former FBI director being an untruthful slimeball pretty pretty spectacular stuff Abraham Lincoln looks on and weeps but you know this is the country that we have and we've brought it upon it we bought the ticket we take the ride my friends you know this is the way it works it wouldn't have been you know in some ways it wouldn't we went to got in this with Hillary we've gotten some pretty crappy stuff with Hillary but I will say it wouldn't been this much fun this is pretty this pretty wild so the best part of this is John Brennan who's the former head at the CIA right John Brennan was a political hack just par excellence so he responds to the Hughes the director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Obama and he responds we this this is I love this so much so Donald Trump calls James Comey an untruth the slimeball and John Brennan fights back with this he says your caki stock recei is collapsing after its lamentable journey as the greatest nation in history has known we have the opportunity to emerge from this nightmare stronger and more committed to ensuring a better life for all Americans including those you have so tragically deceived so ack-ack its accuracy by the way is a is a system of government which is run by the worst least qualified or most unscrupulous citizens for those you don't know but I just like I love that the Donald Trump calls Comey a liar a leaker and a slimeball and John Brennan replies with caki stock receipt and lamentable pretty spectacular and there are a lot of memes going around this morning on Twitter and people saying things like me at the drycleaners why is my dry cleaning late the dry cleaner your cactus na Christie is collapsing after it's lamentable journey oh the ego the pretension the stupidity I'm not sure I've ever seen anything quite like it it is it is pretty spectacular in virtually every way and again all of this is just getting more ridiculous so there's a report yesterday and just shows how the media is malfeasance and all of us there's a report yesterday that President Trump had had supposedly fathered an illegitimate child there's no evidence that he fathered an illegitimate child okay there's something called American media Inc they owned the National Enquirer and they allegedly paid 30 grand with an MD no Sid Juden who was a doorman for Trump for the rumor about Trump having an affair with his maid in the 1980s and fathering a child with her apparently okay so here's the problem nobody is able to have been able to determine if the rumor is true so instead what the media do is they reports that the National Enquirer paid 30 grand for the story and then killed it so they're saying the real story is that Trump and his friends kill lots of stories about Trump but what they're really reporting obviously is the salacious rumor that President Trump has a little Trump running around somewhere that we don't know about my only question is whether this is the same maid who had an affair with Arnold Schwarzenegger because that would be a pretty good record right if you have a kid by Schwarzenegger and a kid by Trump and nobody knows about it that's pretty spectacular but it is worth noting that this Dorman's ex-wife said quote he's infamous for making up stories he's seen the chupacabra he's seen Bigfoot one of our friends who passed away he saw him two walking down the street but they're printing this anyway demonstrating once again that this is you know this is what the media are the media are just a bunch of rumour mongers who are seeking to get President Trump and this is why they're on Comey and this weather on this no wonder people don't believe the the quote-unquote fake news ok so meanwhile something intensely stupid was happening in Congress and this I I have some serious comments about Cory Booker is just an awful senator he was a bad mayor he was a guy who grande I mean talk about people who grandstand talk about egos in politics you have to talk about Cory Booker a guy who did the whole food stamp challenge where he pretended the people on food stamps are living only on the food they get through food stamps which is not true it is called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program supplemental as in like beyond the food that you already buy the Cory Booker did that he was famous for posturing and grandstanding he's very pro-israel and he was mayor of New Jersey now of course he's very anti-israel as the senator from New Jersey and Cory Booker of course is the guy who also did his did his famous kind of screaming routine who was it against the one where he had the one where he's like making the funny hands the jazz hands and he went crazy on somebody in Congress and it was and it was really ridiculous well now he's doing it again this time it's with Mike Pompeo so Mike Pompeo who's the former head of the CIA and now is being nominated for the Secretary of State position he is he's brought up on charges by Cory Booker and Cory Booker asks him the most ridiculous question I've ever seen asked in Congress by anyone at any time ever which is saying a lot because Congress is filled with people of low IQ cory booker man he takes the cake here's cory booker asking Mike Pompeo I kid you not about what he thinks about gay sex I am not kidding this is a thing that happened and is now in the Congressional Record the same congressional record that hosts debates between Daniel Webster and his opponents has Cory Booker asking Mike Pompeo what he thinks who sodomy no joke here it is I believe it's a you believe that gay sex is a perversion yes or no senator if I if I can if you yes or no if you believe that gay sex is a perversion because it's what you said here senator not your speeches yes or no do you believe gay sex is a perversion that I'm gonna give you the same answer I just gave you previously my respect for every individual regardless of the sexual orientation it's the same have you seen Brokeback Mountain did you cry did you make a weird face when he Fletcher and Jake Gyllenhaal were going at it mr. presumptive poor Terry did you like moonlight were you a little turned on during that beach scene hmm because if not I'm not sure you can be Secretary of State did you watch call me by your name in slow motion did you did you see the scene with the peach what did you think of it hmm like visit what in the world what is the world like this is a thing that's happening now no matter how crazy you think the Republicans are everybody I'm talking Republicans now no matter how crazy you think Republicans are folks this is like beyond ok it's correct it's it's supremely crazy so I got into a bait about this with a friend of mine named Jane Costin over at Vox so it what's funny about this is the Jane originally if you'll recall a few months back were a pretty pretty nasty piece about for the New York Times but being a genial sort of fellow I reached out now we're pretty friendly Jane is a lesbian and she was very much in favor of this line of questioning and so I was wondering what in the world is it like why does it matter what exactly Mike Pompeo thinks of gay sex like does he have to watch gay porn in order to be in order for hit like show us how much you like gay sex mr. mister if you want me to vote for your confirmation you are going to have to show me how much you enjoy subscribing to Playgirl right now show me your subscription sir sir okay so why exactly is this relevant so Jane I was trying to make the argument that as a public official Mike Pompeo should feel good about gay sex because he's gonna have to defend the rights of gay people this is I think a very a very foolish argument first of all this is plainly religious bigotry okay virtually every religious person in the United States ever deeply religious person every Bible believing person in the United States believes that homosexual activities is in an Orthodox Jew I believe homosexual activity is a sin now welcome to a free country where I think the government should not be involved in anybody sex life I've been a libertarian on the gay marriage issue longer than Barack Obama right and and with all of this I mean I've been I've been saying since legit 2012 2011 that there should be a libertarian position from the government on same-sex marriage I can believe both things right I believe lots of things are sinful as a religious person I think that it's sinful for you to be a racist I also think that you have a right to be a racist in the United States because we have something called free speech I think that it's sinful for I think I think lots of things in life are sinful I think that it is sinful for you to marry your aunt but do I have like a cific you know real concern about people marrying their aunts in terms of public policy not like especially I don't think it's a major issue on the plate right now I think that it's sinful to take drugs but I'm pretty libertarian when it comes to marijuana for example so again this is how most religious people in the United States think they think that there's a difference between what i religiously believe to be a sin and what the government should police and what cory booker should be asking here is what is your perspective on how gay people abroad should be treated and Mike Pompeo just said they should be treated with the same respect accorded to anybody else right which is perfectly acceptable what I think Jane was getting at and what Booker is actually getting at is something a little bit deeper which is their suggestion is that they don't believe you that I don't believe that they don't believe me if I say that I think that homosexual activity is a sin but I also think it's a free country your feel you're free to think I'm an idiot and you're free to disobey me and you're free to do whatever you want I mean I can't give you orders you're an adult do whatever the hell you want right that if I say that I must not be sincere if I think something's a sin in order for me to believe that you have a right to something I have to believe that thing is good this is a really dangerous mentality it's the same mentality that on flip side says on the left that there is no First Amendment except for rhetoric we like right because obviously everyone believes that right the the only way that you should agree with the First Amendment free speech right to say some things if you agree with the thing being said that of course destroys the concept of the First Amendment the whole purpose of freedom is that you have freedom to do things that I may not like that's the whole purpose of freedom if we all did the same things you wouldn't need freedom freedom would be irrelevant but that's not the question being asked so the real implication here the real implication of course is that if you're a religious Christian you cannot be the Secretary of State that's what cory booker really is saying he's saying that if you're a religious christian and you believe homosexual activities are sin even if you're libertarian governmentally even if you think that the United States should defend the rights of people all over the world on these issues you really don't believe it because secretly deep down you have animus toward gay sex you don't like watching gay people go at it or you think it's sinful right this is it is a religious that's right it is prescribed by the Constitution of the United States what cory booker is doing here right now is a religious test he is saying if you are a religious christian and you believe the bible you cannot be Secretary of State that's what this says now the great irony of this the thing that's really incredible about this is Cory Booker then goes on to question Mike Pompeo about Frank Gaffney and Bridget gab and Brigitte Gabriel so Frank Gaffney runs the senator for security policy very very hawkish very hard on Islam and radical Islam in particular Brigitte Gabriel runs something called act for America which is also a group that is opposed to the influence of Sharia law and radical Islam now I may not agree with everything that Frank and Brigitte say but the idea that anyone who's ever associated with Frank and Brigitte is somehow guilty of some grave sin is simply ridiculous Brigitte Gabriel as a Christian Lebanese woman who was forced to live for years in like an eight-by-ten bunker because of Islamic terrorism in Lebanon so she was a pretty good case to make it against Islamic terror but there's another thing here that's really funny listen to cory booker go after pompeii on his association with gaffney and and gabriel were you silent in your position of authority against these words that are violative of the american constitution were you silent with him senator my record on this is unambiguous I served in it then that's that's a response you did not say anything to call out his remarks what about Brigitte Gabriel do you know her I do and someone who has been who runs organization that has been considered a hate group by the anti-defamation league in the Southern Poverty Law Center have you ever were you silent did you ever call her out on her remarks they were hateful or bigoted said I've spoken to a number of groups and my I believe my record with respect to tolerance and here's the part that's really funny okay so what he's asking about specifically I looked up what the the ADL says about Brigitte and what they said about Frank they basically said the same thing about Brigitte did they say about Frank what they say about both is both of them have said that you can't really be a good American citizen if you are a if you are a fundamentalist Muslim if you are a religious Muslim you can't be a good American citizen now that is something with which I disagree depending on how you define religious Muslim if you're defining a religious Muslim as radical Muslim then sure if you're defining religious Muslim is somebody goes to mosque then of course not but here's the part that's hilarious about what Booker is doing here what Booker just said to Mike Pompeo is if you are a religious Christian you cannot be Secretary of State because you believe that homosexual activity is a sin but you also cannot be Secretary of State if you say that members of a particular religion might not make good citizens you see a little bit of a contradiction here so in other words cory booker says that if you say that islam is not compatible with democracy then that is big which you know might be sort of like a quarter to half true okay but then he says if you're a Christian then that's not compatible with democracy so how is this working exactly how's this working exactly but it shows the extremism of the left again if President Trump wants to get reelected all he has to do is somehow convince the left to nominate Cory Booker who is a complete nutjob Ted Joe Biden is is obviously considering the White House run in 2020 and he is making noises saying like well I'm not gonna run if there's somebody else on the Democratic side who can win and then of course he's gonna run he's gonna say there's no one else on the Democratic side who can win the big problem for the Democrats is that Joe Biden might be the only guy who really has a credible shot of beating Trump it ain't Cory Booker it ain't Kirsten Gillibrand it's certainly in Kamala Harris all three of those people are too busy ensconced in their own identity politics of stupidity and alienating vast swaths of America to ever win the presidency so here is Biden basically watching his presidential run I'm really hoping that some other folks step up I think we have some really good people rev I know Barack always asked me that question and he said what's going to make the decision I got to be able to look in the mirror and if I walk away no I'm not walking away because I'm afraid or I'm worried about losing or that I just don't want to take on the responsibility I got to walk away knowing that it is there's somebody who can do it and can win because if we got a win we've got a win in 2020 okay so Biden obviously thinks he's the best shot at doing that and the bigger is the problem for Biden Biden may be too moderate for the modern Democratic Party he could be he might be too moderate he might not be identity politics enough he might not be wildly crazily anti-trump enough Ted Lou's a congressman from out here in California he says listen if we take the house we're gonna go full scale investigation balls-to-the-wall right wall-to-wall investigations of the president Trump nothing would be better calibrated to win Trump reelection than extremism on the part of Democrats erican voters have an ax flexion point this November it can change the makeup of Congress and give Democrats subpoena power and then we will conduct real investigation okay if this is what the direction the Democrats want to go then Trump really does have a shot again the Cory Booker Democratic Party is not

some mailbag so let's jump right in alaya says hey Ben I'm big fan of the show and the leftist year's Cup oh yes aren't we all he says I was wondering what are your thoughts on the American Bar Association and if you think they are to blame for high legal fees in America well any guild is to blame for elevated legal fees one of the big problems in the United States is licensure the problem of suggesting that every different industry has to be licensed so in Arizona right now this big fight over there hairdressers have to be licensed why in the world should you have to be licensed to be a hairdresser like if you if you are a girl you've been dressing your own hair since the time you were very very young okay so I'm not sure why exactly you need a government license in order to cut somebody's hair they it's just it's just ridiculous the same thing is true in the law okay the law school I went there you know I went to the top law school in America by most standards okay and that law school the first year was useful and the last two years were a waste of time and you learn more in studying for the bar than you actually did anywhere else and then you didn't learn anything you really needed to know until you actually started working for a law firm and drawing up contracts and doing all that stuff I think apprenticeships would go a lot further than the guild system they have where you're licensed to become a member of the bar for example Christopher says I want to ask your advice because you're someone who has supported a spouse through medical school I returned to school after my service as an army officer to pursue an MD I recently got married both of us one want kids as I'm sure you can relate to we are now both in our early thirties and we're not getting any younger as a man I feel like I have an obligation my wife and future children to financially support them but that is not feasible for me for a very long time I won't even begin my residency for another six years I'm torn between continuing to pursue my career goals or my family goals thank you for your advice my wife and I listen to you every day together well first of all my great my real suspicion is that there is a way for you and your wife to have children while you are in medical school even if you are supposed to be the the breadwinner and that is you know these student loans are available there are people who are living on student loans who have kids if you are an MD it's pretty easy to get a student loan considering that they know you're gonna be making money on the other end of the MD so I would urge you to look at all the financial solutions available I'd also urge you to go to your local church and talk with people about the possibility of being given a loan you know I know that if there were people in my synagogue who need a loan to go to medical school and they wanted to have a kid that I'd be looking at giving them a loan you know that the charity is is definitely something that's worthwhile here I don't you should miss your childbearing years to go to medical school but I mean another possibility is that you have kids right now you work for a few years build up a little nest egg and then go to medical school that's a possibility too I and I think life presents you a number of ways of slicing this particular egg and I think that it shouldn't be it shouldn't be worth giving up you know the most important thing you can do in life which is having children rearing them because you have career aspirations again I don't think they're mutually exclusive josh has haben do you think we'll get involved in Syria or is it a nothing burger love the show also love my bowl and bran sheets well I'm glad that you enjoy your bowl and bran sheets Josh they are indeed fantastic do I think we'll get involved in Syria I think that we'll be involved in Syria is slightly more than we are currently I don't think we're going to full-scale war in Syria I don't think there's a public support for it I don't think there's a good strategy for it I think the idea of toppling Assad would require enormous amounts of manpower money blood I don't think anybody wants that I think the best we can do is try to check Iranian ambition in the region and let our regional allies do some heavier work around the Mideast in order to minimize their influence Kirk says what do you think the pros and cons of the flat tax and fair tax are which one do you prefer so the fair tax from what I recall depending on the there are different fair tax proposals but the fair tax is essentially a national sales tax it gets rid of the income tax the flat tax says there's an income tax but you but it is flat across the board I tend to be more in favor of the fair tax I like the idea of a national sales tax because being taxed for per transaction on consumption is easier to monitor and then it's also up to you what you wanted with your money if you want to buy things they're gonna be taxed on it if you don't want to buy things then you won't be taxed on it the same thing is not true of income tax the the idea of having to turn over to the government how much money I owe on a regular basis if you go to limit let's put this way if you could eliminate either the sales tax or the income tax I would eliminate the income tax in the state of California we have both I would eliminate the income tax because I think it is much easier for people to play class warfare with the income tax than it is for them to play class warfare with the sales tax because rich people do buy more stuff than poor people okay Kenny says hey Ben I was wondering your thoughts on the prenuptial agreement I've heard both sides if you do want your marriage is doomed or if you're gonna be together forever who cares your thoughts thank you huge fan I'm not against prenuptial agreements we basically Judaism almost mandates then that's what a ketubah is right a ketubah is a is a marital document that actually includes the divorce amount right that if I divorce my wife it actually says in my ketubah home money I owe her in fact there's a really funny story there's there in the Jewish community they're sort of a particularly in the Sephardic Jewish community there's sort of a tradition of haggling over the amount of money in the ketubah right like how much you and you haggle usually not with your wife because that would be real awkward but with her parents very often and so I remember I went to talk but one day I was up in in Sacramento which is where my in-laws live and my in-laws my my father-in-law comes up to me is right before I was getting married and he says you know Ben is Israelis Ben and I have to a very serious conversation with you and I said okay and he says I thought okay something Bad's coming here and he says I just want to talk to you about the amount in the ketubah I said I don't care what you put in there I'm not getting divorced so whatever you want like men doesn't I said no no really what do you want to put in there and I said well as I said I don't care put a hundred million dollars and he goes oh my god is it worth 100 million dollars put ten million dollars so that's what's in the ketubah is ten million dollars but I'm not anti prenuptial agreement I think that thinking through the consequences of your actions early is probably not a terrible idea and it depends I mean it's the mentality going in I think that if you say to your wife or your prospective wife listen I want you to be guaranteed a certain amount of money if things should go south this is actually my guarantee to you that things will go well it depends what you're looking for in the prenup if what you're looking for in the prenup is you get off scot-free then I think your wife has a reason to be suspicious if what you're putting in the prenup is here's a liquidated damages provision that makes this you know pretty likely to be locked in then I think that it's not a terrible idea by any stretch of the imagination let's see it says Janice what would you recommend is the best personal finance book to piggyback off of that what are your thoughts on separate bank accounts for married couples thanks for taking the time to answer my questions so I do not have a separate bank account for my wife I trust my wife with our finances and I'm not concerned she's gonna be stealing our money also I think that full transparency is good in marriage when it comes to finances having separate bank accounts seems to me a mistake if you can't trust somebody enough to handle money with you you can't trust them enough to raise children with you as far as the best personal finance book I really think that a lot of what Dave Ramsey says is really terrific I think Dave Ramsey's program is quite good and I know a lot of people been helped by Dave Ramsey's program particularly brian says I read an article on The Daily wire about South Carolina trying to leave the USA if second amendment is repealed what is the chance this happens and if they're successful in passing that bill what other states will follow well you know I don't know they could presumably pass a bill now to do that but the Civil War basically answered the question as to whether states can secede from the union if they feel that their rights have been violated by the way the Second Amendment is never gonna be repealed the repeal of an amendment requires two-thirds of states three-fifths two-thirds of Congress and three-fifths of all states to to go along with it you're not gonna get 30 states to go along with repealing the Second Amendment so it really is not a worry Tyler says what's your opinion on property taxes do you think they violate the founders idea of owning property since in some states who are essentially renting your property from the government yeah I'm anti property tax I'm anti virtually all forms of taxation I think sales tax is probably the only kind that it's the least objectionable kind in other words but the idea that I'm supposed to keep paying taxes on property that I bought ten years ago fifteen years ago as though I'm renting from the government I think that's just absurd I think it's ridiculous Chase's - the other day he stated that the Republicans may never control all the branches of government again what made you say that thanks again for the great show well I think frankly that everybody was shocked that Donald Trump won the presidency is very likely the Republicans lose the house in 2018 and the upcoming generation of Millennials is really really anti-republican something like 55 21 Democrat / Republican that is not a great indicator for the future of republicanism and I was saying that a little bit hyperbolically I think that the chances that Republicans will never control all branches of government again is low I don't I I never think it's the end of the world but I think that the near future does not look particularly bright for Republicans on the federal scale it looks better on the state level Sean says hey Ben do you think Christians will go to heaven yes so the Jewish perspective on heaven is that if you fulfill seven basic Commandments then you go to heaven and these Commandments are really really basic it's like don't kill people don't steal don't commit adultery don't don't cut flesh from a living animal believe in God establish courts of law it's it's all very very basic stuff they're called the shovel midslope but they know off the 7 the 7 commandments that were given to the sons of noah and in judaism everybody who is not a son of abraham is considered a son of noah so if you're if you're outside Benet yes or Al or son of Jacob then you are considered a son of Noah and subject to those particular laws ok brad says what is your position on the various official positions taken against animals in Leviticus as an Orthodox Jew why would you not follow these things this is a serious question as I read the Bible meaning am i pro or anti sacrifice so there's a lively debate inside Jewish commentators over what exactly the purpose of the animal sacrifices were in the temple so Rambam had Maimonides he says when the purpose of animal sacrifices were to wean people away from animal sacrifices the basically pagan societies embraced animal sacrifices and really liked animal sacrifices and so what the Torah did was it said instead of you performing animal sacrifices to propitiate the gods instead of that what it's going to be is that we're gonna regularize this stuff it's not gonna be used slaughtering animals in your backyard you have to go to a centralized site that is run by priests who are worshipping God and then you're going to have to be thinking about your relationship with God every time an animal is slaughtered in order for us to make this non holy activity holy and that's that's Maimonides perspective my motty's perspective says that in the future if the temple is really when the in judaism when the temple is re-established then it will not then there may not be animal sacrifices at all and that's a significant possibility and then there are people who say that the whole purpose of these sacrifices is to remind you that really you've committed sins that make your life forfeit and it's only through God's mercy that you are not being killed right now and the brutality of animal sacrifice is supposed to it's not supposed to be pleasant it's supposed to be unpleasant it's supposed to be remind you that you are an animal unless you unless you supersede your animalistic instincts and and and become something more rachel says what is your favorite Disney Pixar movie well the best five minutes of a Disney Pixar movie are the first five minutes of up Bar None the first of the first five minutes above are just incredible the rest of the movies good but I'm not sure that it holds all the way you know let me look up a real a really quick list of all the Disney Pixar films because now I want to now I want to try to remember though what all of them are so I thought inside-out was quite good I liked Toy Story 3 I thought was really terrific it means really not a sequels fan but I thought toys Story 3 was was really first-rate the just in terms of fun I thought monsters University was quite good there's some fun stuff in in ratatouille probably I'd probably have to go toy story 3 I'd probably have to say Toy Story 3 is is my favorite although again I think toys is quite good actually not like the original Toy Story very much how Brayton says hey Ben I'm a college student in class the other day my teacher told the class that we are all illegal immigrants because our ancestors stole the land from Native Americans and we have no legal rights to the land then saying we have no room to talk if we are against illegal immigration since I've never heard that argument before I had no way to combat the ridiculous statement so I was wondering how you would respond well there are a couple of different responses here so one is sort of the founding response which is that in order to stake a claim to a land you have to have permanent presence on the land and you have to cultivate it right this is the Lockean response to property ownership which is why there is such a thing in Western in law called the adverse possession which is if I own a piece of land and I just leave it fallow for a hundred years I just buy it leave it there and you go and you live on it and you set up a house and then you set up a farm and you live there for 20 years and I come back and I say what are you doing on my land that I can't actually kick you off you have now adversely possessed the land because you're cultivating it and I am not so if Native Americans didn't cultivate the land in in a way that amounted to a central ownership then they didn't have the properties of ownership and land second of all even if you put that argument aside which is you know a dicey argument in some ways then certainly one thing is true population movement has been happening forever and many of the Native American tribes that were present at the founding of the United States were actually relatively recent arrivals in that part of the United States so native tribes dispossessed each other the native tribes during certain portions of American history dispossessed settlers settlers dispossessed American tribes that's not to say that brutal treatment of Native Americans was justified in any way what it is to say is that if we're gonna pretend that land is not transferred between peoples then that is silly and sovereign governments do have the right to push people to to to set their borders sovereign governments have a right to set their borders and then the question becomes can you defend it alright so if you're not willing to defend it then you're not defending it on a practical level but the question is to whether the United States has a right to defend its border because Native Americans were incapable of defending their borders against the original American settlers I don't see really how that follows right there's two questions one is the moral and one is the practical on a practical on a moral level they're on a moral level there are two questions one is is it immoral to dispossessed people of their land as a general rule the answer is generally yes the second question is is is this unprecedented in human history or is it the regular way things work practically speak the answer is yes and then the third question is practically speaking Ken states defend their borders and morally speaking can they defend their borders in the answer on both of those is yes okay one more question let's see santino says hey Ben I've recently switched my major from music education to political science I've been having a real hard time dealing with this only because the university I'm attending gave me a full tuition scholarship for music but I just don't have a passion for it anymore I'm stuck in a situation now where I'm gonna have to pay for college dry cut without any financial assistance as my parents do not understand the financial aid process one bit you were the one who inspired me to take on this new chapter in my life well I'm sorry I blew it up for you dude so I figured I'd reach out to you for advice on what to do and what job opportunities are out there for political science majors like myself we're currently still in college thank you for a constant fight for conservatism and the founding principles of America you've truly changed my life well I can't say this I would say that the the general rule is that you're gonna make more money being a Poli Sci major than a music major there are a lot of very poor music majors Poli Sci majors you can go into journalism you can go into law you can go into teaching you can you can go into accounting or I mean Poli Sci leaves a lot of doors open and so you know I think that you'll be able to make a living but you should decide what it is about Poli Sci that you like do you want to work in government some work outside government you want to work you know in a place like Daily wire and then and then there's a set of steps that you can take to facilitate your goals and I would just say keep your eye on the prize and come up with a plan feel free to email me by the way and I'm happy to send you some steps if you send me your goals like some steps that I think would be useful for you to take in pursuit of those goals okay time for some things that I like and then some things I hate and then and then that'll be the end of the week so let's let's go to the things I like so first off slow clap for Rosamund Pike so Rosman Pike is the actress from gone girl you'll remember and she's speaking to up rocks and chews asked about the possibility of a female as James Bond and here's what she said so what she said was I just right I just say right in a new story James Bond is a character that Ian Fleming created of course the brand has become bigger and whatever but take one of the Bond girls and give her her own story I think the character of James Bond is a man he is really to have such a character and a completely independent series why should a woman sort of get sloppy seconds why should she have once been a man and now it has to be played by a woman why not make her a kick-ass female agent in her own right and she said that swapping a woman in two plays such an iconic ly male role would be to underestimate a woman entirely there's nothing really about the James Bond characters written by Ian Fleming that resembles a woman it's very masculine creation so sure make her an unapologetic unexpected kick-ass amazing female agent and yes I'll play her how is this even a difficult question obviously Rosamund Pike is right she must be listening to the bench Schapiro sure I've been saying this for years about the James Bond stupidity but it's amazing that it takes Rosman Pike to cut through the crap here well done Rosamund Pike now I'm gonna see your movies more often because I like that so much okay other things that I like so yesterday I played a little bit of Guys and Dolls for you there's a little-known musical by the same people who wrote Guys and Dolls well Frank Loesser who wrote fries Guys and Dolls it's called the most happy fella it really is cyrano de bergerac for people who don't know when the original cyrano de bergerac Cyrano de Bergerac is the story of a of a soldier who has a really big nose they did a version of this with called Roxanne with um with Steve Martin and the and the soldier is a he has a really big nose he falls in love with with a woman who he is afraid of wooing because he is so ugly and so there's another guy who crawls in love with her as well and he starts basically using that guy as a proxy for his own feeling so he writes love letters and on behalf of this other guy the woman falls in love with the love letters of the other of Cyrano de Bergerac but she's falling in love with the other guy because she thinks he's the one writing them and of course that ends up being not the reality most happy fella is a sort of modernized take on that now in this case there's an older Italian fellow who falls in love with a waitress at a diner and invites her out to his Napa Valley winery and he has sent her a picture of somebody else who works on the farm and the first time she meets him she realizes that he's actually ugly and and this is what it sounds like so it's it's you know this is the fun part of the musical it gets very dark in certain points and again it's a very modernized version because in the plot what actually ends up happening with this woman is she the the guy who he's using as the stanzin actually sleeps with her and impregnates her and then takes off and now the Italian guy has to decide whether or not he wants her whether he likes her whether you know what he thinks of her it's it's really interesting in a lot of ways and the woman who the woman who's playing the lead right here actually ended up marrying the guy who wrote the musical Frank Loesser okay time for a couple of things that I hate all righty so this is a pretty amazing clip so there is a a speech at a law school at CU at CU NY and the associate professor of South Texas College of Law on Houston Josh Blackman visited the college to speak on the topics of originalism of the importance of free speech on campus and here is what it looked like when he went to speak and then the answer is to change the law okay so this is an amazing thing and it does demonstrate how insane everybody has become f the law this is legitimately law students who are standing there saying F the law he's saying the law doesn't allow this and they say F the law yeah this is this is the tower and divers left at their finest F the law at a law school with a law professor just geniuses of highest order the future of our country is bright obviously I mean a final thing that I hate to joy behar over on the view she says that the only thing that saving the country right now is not the sanity of the people surrounding President Trump it's not President Trump it's not Congress it's not the constitutional structure it's the sanity of vladimir putin and kim jeong-hoon here's one of the russian prime minute one of the guys over there said we do not do diplomacy by tweet yeah thank you thank you well okay that's that's just sheer ridiculous nonsense the idea that Vladimir Putin and Jim kim jeong-hoon are the stabilizers of the universe is insane Russia came out today and said that Britain was responsible for the gassing of people in Syria Britain well you can't come up with a better story than that that's who sanity joy Behar's relying on makes me question joy may her sanity but you know I'll have to discuss that with her when finally they invite me on the view I mean what the hell guys I was I was told that my was hold months ago that this was a possibility are you just afraid what's the story I'm gonna dare you an hour I dare you bring it okay let's do this thing come on okay fine well now we're at the weekend and so have yourself a merry little weekend we will be back here on Monday with all the latest news I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our technical producer is Austin
