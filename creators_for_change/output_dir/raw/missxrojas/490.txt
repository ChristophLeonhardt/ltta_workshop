00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,000
add me on that the story is kind of a

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,519
story of<font color="#E5E5E5"> space exploration and</font>

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,500
university life at the same time and

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,539
it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a mystery as well I don't</font>

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's very exciting i recently</font>

at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommendation of maureen johnson</font>

17
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,570
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm finding it I hate writing</font>

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,790
programs<font color="#E5E5E5"> I absolutely hate them I hate</font>

19
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,219
their stupid patronizing prompts I

20
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,100
dislike them the Scrivener is amazing

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for academic writing and finding it</font>

22
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,640
very useful as well I have a lot to read

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,160
at the moment I'm doing for co again and

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,020
which is very interesting slightly

25
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,670
different perspective Madhu Finnegan's

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">wait still and we are just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font>

27
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,949
reading so much everyone i'm reading so

28
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,180
much i'm glad i got a little bit ahead

29
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,059
of my work in an octave a break but i'm

30
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,040
i'm reading unlocked at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment i</font>

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,720
finished the brief wondrous life of

good I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoyed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'd be really</font>

34
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,150
interested in any of you have read it

35
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,369
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't speak</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Spanish I'd be</font>

36
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:15,869
interested to know what you thought of

37
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,610
it and how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> found reading it I feel</font>

38
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,680
like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> demands of you a kind of some</font>

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,049
kind of knowledge of spanish or

40
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,700
colloquialism I don't know it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

41
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,530
interesting how you how you kind of wade

42
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,450
through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> without that knowledge but</font>

43
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was brilliant it's definitely</font>

44
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,720
generational it reminds me of house<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

45
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,890
the spirits which is really funny

46
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,020
because in many ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can find two</font>

47
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,490
more different books a slightly

48
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,490
supernatural hint of it meshed in with

49
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,670
references to video<font color="#CCCCCC"> games and general</font>

50
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,220
popular nerd culture is just it makes it

51
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,680
a really touching book in some ways a

52
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,810
cyclic nature of it was a little bit

53
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,729
depressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of claimed by that</font>

54
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,040
but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it was very good can I say</font>

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,500
how many more times it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very good</font>

56
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I also red light in August by Faulkner</font>

57
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,700
and hash words and I say about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

58
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,080
I'm about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to a class where have</font>

59
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,750
to read that<font color="#CCCCCC"> essay about it aloud but it</font>

60
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,220
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting it was</font>

61
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,410
interesting the way book no switches as

62
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,880
always between different perspectives

63
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,280
and the way he spoke about light in the

64
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,900
way he spoke about faces there were so

65
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,100
many common threads through that

66
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,390
normally you can just follow and then

67
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,790
they will find a new one at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

68
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,610
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a purpose for them it's</font>

69
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,930
truly<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing really the last thing I</font>

70
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,640
wanted to mention some mad fighters have

71
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,840
been trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to talk about this</font>

page which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find in the bar below</font>

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,440
