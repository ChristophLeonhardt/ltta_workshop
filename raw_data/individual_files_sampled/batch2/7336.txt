Jared Kushner's big week of scandals isn't quite over we've got Friday and we've got maybe one of the worst parts actually it's actually a two-part scandal so buckle up Jared earlier this week we were talking about the nearly half billion dollars in loans that Jared was able to secure for his corporation after a series of meetings with billionaires inside of the White House now that should be enough but it's not it's actually worse than that one of those loans is looking even more suspicious now with new information so just reminding you about the one we're going to talk about here the New York Times reported this week that Apollo Global Management made a 184 million dollar loan to cushion our companies last year shortly after its chief executive met with Kushner at the White House now what's interesting is some of the other stuff that was going on around that time according to the AP Apollo said it's 2018 annual report that the SEC had halted an inquiry into the firm previously reported that the Obama administration SEC had subpoenaed it for information related to the issue so under Obama the SEC had started investigating this company they meet with Jared Kushner they give him a loan and suddenly the SEC isn't interested anymore in investigating what Apollo Global Management had been up to that seems as quid pro quo ish as you can possibly add it was already bad enough with the money yes that's what we were talking about that the other day it was already terrible with the the quid pro quo with you know we'll meet with you and then I'll give you alone may be favorable access but then they drop in at the SEC the head of the SEC is J Clayton who is a former Wall Street lawyer representing goldman sachs in the bailout how they got that money that bailout money he represented them I think Elizabeth Warren during his confirmation hearing said you were literally the worst person that could ever had the SEC or something along those lines I'm definitely paraphrasing but J Clayton is not someone who's going to be cracking the whip on Apollo or any major company that's doing shady things behind the scenes yes so of course the kirshner family says oh he was meeting with the Apollo guys well color us surprised he's not technically with the company anymore I mean all of our family money is tied in their company but he's not technically with the company anymore and the SEC says oh he was meeting with Apollo right before we dropped the case yes and well color us surprised as well huh what a wonderful I mean unfortunate coincidence yeah it's a lot of coincidences in the Trump administration there's been a lot of coincidences about Jared Kushner lately it's possible that's just the the coincidental outcome of a lot of investigations all happening at the same time or it could be aided from inside of the White House I mean this information isn't coming out of nowhere someone is releasing it and I mean each component of the Jared Kushner story we say this all time I apologize we should just put it on the the sound Bank if it had happened under Obama it would be the biggest scandal for both of his terms but here it is entirely possible that Jared just skates I don't know that's gonna happen the free journal had an editorial calling for Jared and Ivanka to step down which means that the people behind the Wall Street Journal were in favor of that position and we know that Kelly is escalating his feud against them and this certainly doesn't look good but all of these scandals one after the other you know what I'm gonna throw one more on you might look at Jared at this picture of him looking all sad and think I don't really care if I cross that guy but you might want to because look at what happened to someone who didn't go along with his deal the intercept reporter on Friday that Kushner company's tried unsuccessfully to lobby Qatari Finance Minister al Shariff al-ahmadi to try to secure investments for his troubled property at 666 Fifth Avenue in New York City one month after Katara's government turned down the loan request the company found itself blockaded by a group of nations led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE and Kushner was reportedly a driving force inside the administration of supporting the blockade and that property is you know has 30% on occupancy like theirs it's all completely occupied and in addition to that it has a 1.2 billion dollar mortgage it's just it's there arguably most distressed investment you know and so desperate for some kind of investment you can see Kushner's we're trying to make all kinds of deals and this is two points being excuse me first to John's point which is could Krishna skate on this yeah we seen Donald Trump sort of circle the wagons around people closest to him and Kushner would be one of them although this just appears to be he's a train wreck of conflict Jared Kushner and this is pay-to-play I mean this you know you don't need to connect many dots at all to see the conflict here and and he just is a conflicted member of this administration this is exactly why you shouldn't have conflicts of interest floating out there because it gives at a bare minimum the appearance of corruption so I think it's more than an appearance but no one can argue that there isn't an appearance of corruption because look at Citigroup wants two things there's two different groups that were giving loans to Kushner companies one was citigroup one was Apollo Management Citigroup wanted two things lower taxes and deregulation of the financial industry what did Kushner push for lower taxes and deregulation of the financial industry all right now know it doesn't look good but you can say hey that's the Republican position they you turn to Apollo what at Apollo one well Apollo also won lower taxes but most importantly they wanted a very special loophole for private equity companies to be maintained now Trump had said that he was not going to keep that loophole so that is not a standard position of the Trump administration had somehow they changed that position now okay well Kushner's met many times with the founder of Apollo and then the Apollo Group says oh the loan we gave them went through standard process the founder was not aware of it the founder was not aware of 158 million dollar loan as he met with Kushner over and over again so they wanted the loophole they got the loophole that was changing policy now on top of that they had an SEC investigation dropped OH shortly after the meeting come on if that's not the appearance of corruption you're trying not to see it but if you're even a look progressives get an independence yet it we don't talk about that anymore but even if you're a Trump voter this isn't this the exact swamp you're worried out and you know it is yeah the problem is that if you're a trump voter you're probably on you're unlikely to have heard about this because I can't say that Fox News hasn't covered Jared Kushner's scandals this week they have for 22 seconds analysis by Media Matters that's all only covered again this would have brought the Barack Obama administration to a screeching halt if one of his people had done this it would have brought any administration to a screeching halt this this is insane and an toric level corruption and to Jim's point on the size of that loan and and suggesting that some kind of going through some sort of routine process this is three times as big alone as they normally issue so this would get the attention of everybody at the top of this of this corporation it's a it's a it seems naked Lea clear that Jared Kushner is using this office for his own benefit yeah someone needs to do some sort of like psychological analysis into Ivanka Trump because she is married her father she is married a man who consistently fails and does not do good business deals works in the real estate industry and always goes around what is legal with his right to do and those to do with I mean in the transition he was lobbying people in Russia to essentially veto or stall the vote on the United Nations condemning the settlements in Israel he was already getting started in the transition going after that so he from start to finish his tenure in the White House has been completely corrupt much like his father and one last quick point about that and you point out the relationship and parallel between those two there's something else going on here in this administration and you see it played out with the Jared thing and with the Trump thing of course and that is these are very rich people who are used to not having to play by the rules that the rest of us play by and and you know that is the way the societies set up rich people don't have to play by the rules of the rest of it we kind of know that but to see it played out in such a high wire act way as with this administration is scary because the repercussions are massive for all of us now it's not just some contractor he sniffing these are rules they're not playing by that effect all of us as Americans you just watch the video by the Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more
