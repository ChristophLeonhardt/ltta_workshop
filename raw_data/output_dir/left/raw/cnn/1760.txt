1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
herd these shipping containers that are
tied up some 3,000 shipping containers

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,120
tied up in the main port in Puerto Rico
we recently heard from the mayor of San

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,759
Juan saying that she wishes she could
essentially open the gates and get those

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,490
shipping containers to where they need
to go but she doesn't have jurisdiction

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,380
over the port's another problem is
actually getting truckers to go pick

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,970
those containers up and take them to
where they are needed one issue is

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,289
communication cellular service is spotty
at best so communicating with those

8
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,590
truckers is difficult fuel is another
big problem in part because not every

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,420
gas station is operational many that are
don't have electricity so people need

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,239
cash to be able to pay for gas many
banks and ATMs are shut down in part

11
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,899
because there is no electricity
it is a gridlock of problems and

12
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,590
officials tell us that they are doing
the best that they can to deal with them

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,800
but here on the ground we are hearing
again and again from people that they

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,809
are not seeing the help that they need
many people asking us where is FEMA I

15
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,159
spoke with a father a short while ago a
father of three who told me that one of

16
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,990
his children was asking for milk earlier
and it drew him into a deep deep pain

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,520
because he knew that milk wouldn't be
getting to him anytime soon John and

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,900
papi for Sanchez there in San Juan thank
you so much how long is it going to be

19
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,880
until those 9500 containers just sitting
there with these vital supplies are

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,409
actually released from the port and sent
to the victims of Hurricane Maria CNN

21
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,500
spoke to the general manager of a
shipping company trying to find out more

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,890
about what's going on listen to this we
currently have approximately three

23
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:48,180
thousand containers full of emergency
supplies relief cargo there's all kind

24
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,540
of goods commercial materials
construction materials as well medicines

25
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,619
and everything and all kind of goods on
food there's a lot of food in these

26
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,530
containers there's also reefers that are
filled of food as well frozen poultry as

27
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:12,980
an example pork and others and so far
our terminal is completely

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:19,310
to its capacity maximum capacity and we
have been able to dispatch a barely 4%

29
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:26,209
of our usual flow at our exit gates the
problem has been with the with the

30
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:31,400
logistics the part of the supply change
that moves the cargo from our terminal

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,819
to the shelves or to the tables of the
people of Puerto Rico now for those

32
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:42,379
employees who have been able to get to
their workplace and for those trucking

33
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:46,760
companies as an example they have their
equipment available and ready then

34
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,549
they're facing the challenge of the fact
that there's no fuel so if you have the

35
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:57,049
equipment you have the drivers but you
don't have the fuel then you definitely

36
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:03,290
cannot afford to move the cargo if this
continues on if we are not able to start

37
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:09,410
dispatching cargo there's not going to
be sufficient space to unload our next

38
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,459
barges that are in line to come to the
port and the stuff that's coming from

39
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,940
FEMA and from private companies from the
government where's it all coming from

40
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:23,000
it's all around there's emergency
supplies there's relief cargo from FEMA

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,829
there's all food for for DC and Puerto
Rico all supermarkets I mean you name it

42
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:36,560
that is very sad and frustrating for
whatever reasons that that we have

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,870
plenty of inventory about in our ports
there's enough to supply the needs it's

44
00:03:41,870 --> 00:00:00,000
just a matter again how do we move them
to the final destination
