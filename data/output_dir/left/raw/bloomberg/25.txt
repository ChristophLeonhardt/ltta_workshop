But there is more to Macau than slot machines
and roulette wheels.

00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:32,020

have to spend your time throwing your money

14
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,280
away in air conditioned rooms.

15
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,530

00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,530
site

17
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,700
Here the blend of Portuguese and Chinese culture
is plain to see.

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:40,040
Churches sit alongside temples. While fortresses
bear a mix characteristics.

19
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,490
These are the ruins of St. Paul’s, probable
the the most well-known landmark in Macau.

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,600

college but was destroyed by fire in the 19th

21
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
century.

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,719
It features baroque carvings of oriental themes.

23
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,009
The bend of cultures has also shaped the food
scene.

24
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:05,790
Street vendor's will sell you sell you Portuguese
custard tarts and pork chop bun, which are

25
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,030
the Macau version of a hamburger.

26
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,160
At the other end of the spectrum is A Lorcha.

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,220

Tower,

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,280

above the ground.

32
00:02:36,650 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure beats walking
