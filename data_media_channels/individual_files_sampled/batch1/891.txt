a first since the military crackdown in Myanmar a government minister tours a refugee camp in Bangladesh home to 1 million rahega they have given him a list of 13 demands before agreeing to return home so how will the government respond and how committed is it to resolving the crisis this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm fully battable for the first time since Myanmar's military crackdown that led to a massive refugee crisis a government minister has been at a camp for o Hendra in Bangladesh and the visit sparked a heated exchange social welfare minister win me at a met with about 40 refugees at the ax-cut of a long camp in Cox's Bazaar but they became angry when the minister reportedly said they must accept national verification cards and say they are migrants from Bangladesh the refugees say they belong to Myanmar about 700 thousand ravindra have fled violence in Myanmar since August and are now living in overcrowded camps Bangladesh and yanma agreed their repatriation should begin in January but there were delays because of security concerns for the refugees returning home the minister has been trying to reassure them repatriation is a priority I really appreciate the government of their Bangladesh for us for their support here for us and now the the meeting is very successful and we knew about actually we already know about these conditions and the most important thing is the disturb the repatriation process as soon as possible so all the difficulties but the revenger want to be recognized as citizens of Myanmar before the repatriation starts and they want their security supervised by the United Nations we want to make our demands known that we want to be called Rohingya refugees and not called Bengalis the Burmese government has committed genocides before leaving a stateless we demand justice for that too so the refugees have issued a list of 13 demands before they say they'll return to Myanmar they include the closure of all IDP or internally displaced persons camp since it way and the Rakhine region the recognition of RO Hendra as an ethnicity and restoration of their citizenship return of their land and property and the release of all Ranjha who've been imprisoned unjustly well let's bring in our guests now for today's inside story in London ton keen president of the Burmese Rehema organization in the UK in Cox's Bazar Bangladesh is Shelley takraw spokeswoman for the World Food Programme and also in London Laura Hague Amnesty International's myanmar researcher thank you all for being with us today on inside story tune kin in London if I can start with you how hopeful are you that these demands by the RO Hendra including the restoration of citizenship will be met by Myanmar's government I think we have to look at how the systematically Burmese military and government been doing the ROE Hingis is quite a long time and we as far as the way the attitude towards from Inger it's been going on about six months now eight months now we're more than 700 roe yes fled from Burma to Bangladesh so we have not seen any attitude swirling I have changed at all and I have I can see this Minister we me a visit is a kind of public religion to ace international pressure to shoot to the international community and this is he is the person who mentioned who accused the Rohingya burned their own homes and they ran without any evidence that's what he mentioned so it is just a sure to ace international pressure and the way the government attitude is not shit I don't think this is just any practically they want to do anything because the problem here we need to look at the still people are fleeing threatening explosion in Burma in Rakhine estate what is going on we need to look at that before their return but to get this important turn white sorry to interrupt you say this is just a PR campaign from the Burmese government but the government seems to be taking some steps is it not to resolve this crisis and an even ensure justice we've seen recently seven soldiers are put in jail for crimes committed against the rindra is it not a first step is it not a good first step already do you think they're not genuine about the steps they want to take because if you look at that is you know two reporters who revealed these these atrocities to Indian village you know it's been revealed by two writers reporters they've been arrested and it's already you know international level or quite well aware that's what they want to cover up what they did massive you know atrocities they want to cover up by you know jail in only seven soldiers so we are looking at here you know I see Syrio Forel there is many soldiers like there you know but you haven't answered my question you haven't answered my question as to why you won't trust the government because the this Burmese government is denying all the atrocities right they are not allow in fact finding mission why they are not allowing international Meteor why they are not allowing humanitarian aid access if they are sincere this is Michael my question to you okay let me bring in Shelley to crown now in Cox's Bazar Bangladesh Shelley the WFP for which you work for is only one of two organizations have been allowed in Rakhine said they've been allowed access to rock instead can you tell us about the situation there right now what your people on the ground are telling you are our conditions ripe for some of these refugees to start returning so what I can tell you is really about more about the conditions that are that are occurring in the mega camp in in could it belong the refugees continue to arrive not on a daily basis but at least some a weekly basis we've seen something like 5,000 reinga refugees arrive in 2018 so my understanding is is that when you ask people do you want to go home of course people saying you want to go home we want to live in our houses but we only want to go if it's safe we only want to go if it's if it's if it's our well if it's up to us you know nobody wants to to be forced to be forced back to two homes where they really don't know what to expect you know I've been here for more than eight months now and you know every day I see this can grow larger and larger it's a city we call it a mega camp it's overcrowded and as you mentioned you know land is land as a premium and we're working against the time right now against the clock for monsoon preparedness so there are yes you know why there are political cards on the table so to speak you know the conversations that are occurring and ends of various parties that are involved in different discussions you know our immediate focus is you know how do we ensure that the six hundred and eighty eight thousand people many of whom are children continue to receive food and we probably have a potential public health outbreak a disease outbreak on our hands you know with heavy rains right possibly cholera so you know this this I think you know we yes we need to sort of really focus on on the immediate situation of how we can ensure you know the people people are safe and people are out of harm's way and more immediately and we're looking to sort of you know make sure that they're moved from some of the hilltops you know images probably that you have been across our screens and in our newspapers for many many months this I'll ask you a bit more about the sort of preparation as you're making a Shelley ahead of the monsoon season but I want to bring in Laura now in London to talk about the the recent moves by Myanmar's government this ministers visit do you think Myanmar's government is ready to accept these refugees are they genuine about taking steps in addressing this crisis well I think it's a step in the right direction that our Minister is actually gone to Bangladesh and gone to the camps there is still a feeling within me and MA that a lot of this crisis is exaggerated so I think having a member of the government going to Bangladesh to the count's to see the scale of this crisis to hear what the reinjure have experienced what they had to what they've had to flee isn't important is an important move and of course to talk to them about what they want in this conversation about returns no one is actually asking the Ranger what they want is the government serious about 13 demands to the government Minister that you know includes of course recognition of citizenship do you think any of these demands are likely to be met by the government in the short time I think no and I think we do have to see that this push the repatriation it was very much a politically expedient agreement that was being reached between Myanmar and Bangladesh Myanmar is under a lot of pressure from the international community that's a lot of talk about international justice and accountability they need to see people starting to return to Myanmar the reality is at the moment that is not safe for the Ranger to do so Rakhine State is an apartheid state the Ranger is segregated from the rest of society they can't move around freely they can't get to hospitals to schools and they can't leave the state and of course they don't have citizenship but what the government is offering them is essentially a form of citizenship that is actually citizenship at all and won't come with a lot of the rights that are injured around turn keen in London rohesia have been repatriated in the past because unfortunately this is not the first crisis to affect this minority they have been other exodus and they've been other repatriation why is it essential for you that the demands that the community has put forward this time are met what's different this time around from previous crises in the previous crisis these rural Indian refugees returned not as a citizen of Burma and if you look at current crisis where 700,000 the largest exodus ever we have seen and on top of that they burned down and they just try all Rohingya villages and they are building giant prison camps and they are they are they are you know calling the Rohingya refugees to go back the homeland without there is no guarantee of any rights so how could this can happen this time because this is international community much well aware what's happened where mass atrocities being committed by the Burmese military before they are returned as far as what we know we want justice and you know there must be guaranteed all the rights and also safety security we need a protected return to protect at homeland you know because currently what we see in the past and now as a whole Burma you know Burmese military USDP government NLD government and militaries and Buddhist monks they do not want to see rowing as a citizen is very very strong hate speech against Roja in Burma they do and retain Buddhists - they do not want to zero in as a citizen they are telling the Rohingyas are illegal immigrant they are saying so you don't think the mentality says anytime these people can face any time these people can face mass atrocity again in Burma when they return without any protection this is what my point and also citizenship and other protections is needed on top of that where they will return their houses and village has been bulldoze you know it is no point to return to their giant prison camp to go for okay ruin yes this time so we hear you say the conditions are not right for people to start returning to Myanmar I just want to show our viewers now where this crisis is unfolding about 700,000 rural India have fled Myanmar since August to escape violence and the majority of them settled in the district of Cox's Bazar near the border between Bangladesh and Myanmar the kuttappa long camp hosts the largest number of refugees more than fifty thousand about 46,000 have also settled in host communities like okiya and Tecna Shelley chakra I know you've been working a lot with people on the ground and you mentioned the upcoming monsoon season that you're very worried about what's going to happen and the conditions in some of these camps in Bangladesh are already very deplorable so what sort of preparations are you making ahead of what's likely to be a very difficult season for these refugees yeah no it is a race against time and and to you and to basically just to highlight these people have come from Myanmar they're very used to cyclones they they they probably lived on flatter more agricultural land but what they're not used to in Cox's Bazaar in this mega camp is living on the side for hill living in shelters that are very temporary very flimsy with a any kind of touch of heavy rain you know these this this will just slip away that there when you talk to them the biggest concern for us is it's trying to a make land usable and flat and safe to relocate some of the families which we've identified in in what we call a red zone so that's something like 150,000 150,000 people but when you do talk to people they have no concept of what they might be what a flood might look like so it really is it's really about you know not these guys have been through so much already right and you know for another potential disaster to be looming and another fear of having to move and I'm having to sort of you know seek refuge on safer ground some of them will move because we're telling them that you know it's not safe to be where they are some of some will move on their own but again it's you know it's very it's a very it's a very difficult time at the moment just to get everything in place and we have a cyclone which season which could be anything between the next three to four weeks right and then monsoon in in by June and I wonder Shelley I mean you know we we talked about how the row hinter have faced decades of persecution in Myanmar and the most recent crackdown has forced them to Fein unprecedented numbers to Bangladesh I mean this crisis has happened before but it's unprecedented the scale of it right now is unprecedented I wonder how are the host communities in Bangladesh coping how is the government coping what sort of help are you getting from the authorities say no it's a it's a it's a really good point because one of the key factors in all of this is to really try and alleviate any tensions and that might grow between host community and there were huge ease obviously that's a lot of aid there's a lot of attention on the mega camp you know we alone are feeding a hundred and eighty two thousand people every month on food and kind but one of the things that not only agencies like like ours like the World Food Program but other agencies we work very closely with host communities on livelihood projects so working with women to ensure that they can maybe set up a shop have a small loan you know people are doing tailoring businesses and so that's that's really the key really is is to make sure for the three hundred thousand host communities that there are here and it's not a particularly affluent area it isn't these people crossed into a poor part of Bangladesh you know money is money is scarce people talk about you know the the job market being competitive food prices haven't gone up so that's really something that we need to work really closely with our host community with our partners and the government of Bangladesh as well to ensure that there if there are cash cash for work programs or or certain programs that we can you know help really sort of you know ensure that there are you know limited tensions as possible between or between the host community and the refugees okay Laura I want to come back to a point that Tolkien made a moment ago when he talked about the conditions not being there for these refugees to start returning to Myanmar you've said that you know the government has been making some positive steps but I wonder does it have a clear plan for the Rohingya once they return to Myanmar obviously they're facing a lot of pressure from the international community but is there a plan in place from the government do you think - to accept these people back I mean I would actually sorry correct you and say I actually don't think the government has been making that many positive steps I think it's positive that the E Minister has gone to Bangladesh but when you look at what's actually happening in Rakhine State itself you know we don't just have this system of oppression and discrimination but in the last few months the government has been bulldozing homes or has been starting to rebuild now the government says that this is to welcome the new returnees but what our research has shown what satellites show is that actually new security bases are being built on former a hinge villages the air is being increasingly militarized with new heavy pads the reception centers are being built on former Ranger villages and homes and it increasingly looks like the Ranger if they go back would have to live side-by-side with the very same security forces that submit like that you know basically enforce the campaign of death and destruction on them so it's it's not safe for them to go back at the moment and the government is not giving the impression that that is going to change anytime soon and that's something that's further underscored by the fact that today yes we had the the conviction in the case of the Indian soldiers and seven of them sentenced but ultimately this is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what the Miyama security forces did in northern kind stay we're talking about crimes against humanity we're talking about crimes under international law the government so far is unable and unwilling to investigate to prosecute and this is why as to consents we need that ICC referral yeah international justice right the ICC is taking steps towards investigating Mia Strasse fees committed against the Ranger but Myanmar is not party to the Rome statue this limits the ICC's jurisdiction does it not how are they how are they going to to go about investigating these crimes if Myanmar's government doesn't cooperate well so the prosecutor of the ICC has actually requested that the court just this week has requested that the court actually provide clarity on whether or not the crime of forcible deportation would be something that would fall under the court's jurisdiction because the RO inter-community have actually arrived in Bangladesh and crossed an international border Bangladesh is a state party to the Rome Statute but actually it doesn't need a court ruling for that what it needs is for the UN Security Council to refer the situation to the ICC much more pressure on the Chinese and the Russians to to allow for that much more pressure from the US the UK and France as the deployment of members within the UN Security Council but what about the crimes that were committed within Myanmar how would how would they go about dealing with that well again this is this is why we would need a UN Security Council referral the sort of territorial jurisdiction that the court is seeking in Bangladesh your right would only cover one specific crime however that is I think a positive sign that the ICC is looking at ways in which it can prosecute these crimes and I think it sends very clear message to the Miyama authorities that the international community will pursue justice for what happened to the reinjure and all I mean you should be explored let me bring in Tom keen on that Duncan are you hopeful that the international community will go all the way that will pursue justice and seek answers for these horrific crimes committed in Yemen I think yeah it's long way to go but my point here it says Rohingya myself you know 700,000 Rohingyas are in bangladesh refugee camps right now and where is their future and monsoon rainy season is coming and inside a kinda straight we're about approximately 500,000 Rohingyas people are still they are facing atrocities and if they are daily life by their Burmese military and security forces so the point here is our people are day by day you know weakening and the situation refugee camps might get was in a few months time you know where I heard you know from reliable so 109,000 refugees directly will affect more you know landslides and flooding in coming months so so you saw that for you the Rohingya people this is much more priority okay that's also priorities when we are pursuing for the despot so you don't think the priority right now anyway is investigating these atrocities and and you know ICC cases you think the priority should be on the people no no no no priority is same time we have to pursue justice we must bring those responsible you know those who committed genocide cetera which they must claim to the ICC same time we must look at you know how we can protect Rohingya refugees inside Burma and in refugee camps this is also same time we must focus but coming back coming back to the ICC just specifically on that do you think the the international community will step up are you hopeful that the international community will put even more pressure on Myanmar's government I think it's very important that international community have to were quite you know with the coordination and also we a you know we have a strong evidence we're committed genocide against Rome hunger and mlst international have a much more evidence and Human Rights Watch and others so we must move on more stronger way to implicate those countries you know to bring them to refer ICC referral in the US UN Security Council to Burma what we need to do okay Shelly let me give you the last word in Cox's Bazar because obviously that's where the problem is right now a lot of it anyway we've talked about the situation there I wonder about humanitarian access within yanma has there been any improvement on that end i mean again i i would i would echo what both you're both the other guests are saying is that at the moment you know the priority is making sure that there's a voice for these for hunger refugees that we give them immediate support that they need now and for those that still remain you know guess we do we do need to keep the pressure on we do need to make sure that you know this the the you know that there's no more risk to this to to this human life and and that and that if that means you know just continuing as we are now in this emergency doing everything that we can to make sure that you know that they have you know what they need okay to be safe and to live a dignified life thank you so very much for a very interesting and enlightening discussion turn keen shelly to crawl and laura hague thank you all for being on this edition art of inside story
