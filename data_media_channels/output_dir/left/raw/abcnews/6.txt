3
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,467
OUR MOST REVERED LEADERS.

4
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,302
WE HAVE SEEN SEVERAL OF McCAIN'S

5
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,337
COLLEAGUES ENTER THE ROTUNDA

00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,338

CELEBRITIES AND ACTRESSES LIKE

WARREN BEATTY, AND HE HAS CALLED

00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,613
HIS TIME THERE IN THE SENATE THE

10
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,981
MOST IMPORTANT JOB, I HAVE HAD 

11
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,950
IN MY LIFE.

12
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,851
SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS SAID THE 

13
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:48,788
LIONS OF THE SENATE ARE GONE.

14
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,956
IT IS VERY SAD.

15
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,924
TALKING OF COURSE, ABOUT SENATOR

16
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,626
TED KENNEDY AS WELL.

17
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,495
I WANT TO BRING IN JONATHAN 

18
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:55,695
KARL.

19
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,263
AS WE SEE THE HEARSE NOW 

20
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,365
ARRIVING HERE TO CAPITOL HILL, 

21
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,934
YOUR THOUGHTS?

22
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:02,568

McCAIN GO INTO THAT BUILDING FOR

24
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:10,243
THE LAST TIME, IT'S AN EMOTIONAL

25
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:10,610
EXPERIENCE.

26
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,944
THIS IS A SENATOR WHO MADE A LOT

27
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,946
OF ENEMIES IN THAT BUILDING.

28
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,483
HE SPARRED MIGHTILY WITH 

29
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:17,750
DEMOCRATS.

30
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,485
HE SPARRED SOMETIMES EVEN MORE 

31
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,586
MIGHTILY WITH FELLOW 

32
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:23,022
REPUBLICANS, BUT ULTIMATELY, I 

33
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:28,027
DON'T THINK IN MY 20 YEARS 

34
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,796
COVERING THE CAPITOL, THE 

35
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,930
CONGRESS, I SAW SOMEBODY WHO WAS

36
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,500
MORE WIDELY RESPECTED, MORE 

37
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,101
ULTIMATELY BELOVED THAN JOHN 

38
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,670
McCAIN, SO I SUSPECT YOU WILL 

39
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,575
SEE A LONG, LONG LINE OF 

40
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,111
STAFFERS, OF MEMBERS OF 

41
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,080
CONGRESS, THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

42
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,781
EVERYBODY, COMING IN TO PAY 

43
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,615
THEIR RESPECTS.

44
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,384
I KNOW, TOM, WHEN WE GET OFF THE

45
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,886
AIR, I'M GOING UP THERE.

46
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,921
McCAIN HAD A -- HAD A UNIQUE 

47
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,590
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESS.

48
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:05,731
HE WOULD FIGHT WITH REPORTERS.

49
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,934
HE COULD BE CRANKY AND SPAR WITH

50
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,036
YOU, BUT NOBODY I THINK -- ANY 

51
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,871
PUBLIC FIGURE I EVER COVERED -- 

52
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,339
HAD MORE OF A RESPECT AND BELIEF

53
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,776
IN THE IMPORTANCE FOR WHAT WE 

54
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,411
DO, FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF A FREE

55
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,281
AND VIGOROUS PRESS, EVEN A PRESS

56
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,015
THAT ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION 

57
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,283
COULD ANNOY HIM.

58
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,652
>> JON, STAND BY FOR US.

59
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:27,253
IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING OUR 

60
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,488

CARRYING THE BODY OF JOHN 

64
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:35,661
McCAIN.

65
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,330
I WANT TO BRING IN COKIE ROBERTS

66
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:37,597

67
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,931
TALK TO US ABOUT THIS MOMENT 

68
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:39,731
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF

00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:41,901
THE ULTIMATE, IF NOT, THE 

70
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,269
ULTIMATE HONOR WE CAN GIVE ANY 

71
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,570
LEADER IN OUR COUNTRY.

72
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,805
11 PRESIDENTS HAVE HAD THIS 

73
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,606
HONOR.

74
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,374
A HANDFUL OF SENATORS AND IT WAS

75
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,243
DECIDED PRETTY QUICKLY THAT 

76
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,911
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN WOULD 

77
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,646
RECEIVE THIS TREATMENT AS WELL.

78
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,881
>> HE HAS HAD EXTRAORDINARY 

79
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,583
TREATMENT ALL WEEK, HONORING HIS

82
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,324
HE WAS VERY RESPECTED IN THE 

83
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:05,958
SENATE, ALTHOUGH OFTEN IRRATED 

84
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,094
BY THEM, AND THE MOST RECENT 

85
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:12,565
SENATOR TO LIE IN THIS SPOT WAS 

86
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,499
OF HAWAII.

87
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,834
HE WAS A MEDAL OF HONOR WINNER.

88
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,035
THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON THAT 

89
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,738
HAS THIS -- THIS UNIQUE RESPECT 

90
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:21,774
FROM THE CONGRESS AND THE 

91

COUNTRY, AND HERE IN WASHINGTON 

92
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,278
TODAY, THERE WERE ANNOUNCEMENTS 

93
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,646
BEING MADE ON TELEVISION AND 

94
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,281
RADIO STATIONS.

95
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,483
YOU CAN COME TO THE CAPITOL AT 

96
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,085
1:00 AND BE THERE TO PAY YOUR 

97
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,721

I SUSPECT THAT MANY, MANY 

99
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:37,256

00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,226
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST IS

101
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,860
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE 

102
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,597

WHO RUNS THE PLACE WITH HOW MANY

105
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,171
PEOPLE COME AND COME ALL NIGHT 

106
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:52,371
LONG.

107
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,472
IT IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT 

108
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,942
AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO PAY 

109
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:56,909
RESPECT TO THEIR HEROES, AND 

110
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,578
JOHN McCAIN WAS CERTAINLY A 

111
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,145
HERO.

112
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,913

00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,185
THAT IS DRAPING THE COFFIN OF 

116
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,320
SENATOR McCAIN.

117
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,987
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY POIGNANT

118
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,155
MOMENTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE

00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,590
LAST FEW DAYS, INCLUDING WITH 

120

121
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,061

00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:27,606
SO UNFORGETTABLE, AND THERE WILL

130
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:30,643
BE A LOT OF MOMENTS LIKE THAT 

131
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,979

MEMORIAL.

178
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,091
HE KNEW WHEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED 

179
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,493
WITH BRAIN CANCER THAT HE HAD A 

180
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:57,763

THIS MEMORIAL.

184
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,006
AND THIS WASN'T ABOUT 

185
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:07,940
MEMORIALIZING HIMSELF.

186
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,476
HE WAS LOOKING OUT AT A COUNTRY 

187
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,344
THAT WAS DEEPLY DIVIDED.

188
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:15,281
HE WAS LOOKING OUT AT A 

189
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,015
POLITICAL SITUATION THAT FRANKLY

190
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:16,949
HORRIFIED HIM.

191
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:22,321
HE SAID TO HIS CLOSE ADVISERS, 

192
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,824
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD.

193
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,124
EXCEPT HE USED A WORD THAT I 

194
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:27,526
CAN'T SAY ON TELEVISION.

195
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:28,460
HE SAID THAT THE SITUATION, THE 

196
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,329
DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT 

197
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,697
HAVE TO BE SO BITTER, DOESN'T 

198
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,533
HAVE TO BE SO AWFUL, AND HE 

199
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,536
WANTED THIS WEEK OF EVENTS TO BE

200
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,038
A -- TO BE SYMBOLIC ABOUT THE 

201
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:41,673
WAY -- THE WAY POLITICAL 

202
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,075
DIFFERENCES IN THIS COUNTRY 

203
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:43,709
SHOULD BE OVERCOME.

204
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,644
THAT'S WHY HE REACHED OUT.

205
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,146
HE WASN'T PARTICULARLY CLOSE AT 

206
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,381
ALL -- TRUST ME -- WITH BARACK 

207
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:52,051
OBAMA OR GEORGE W. BUSH, BUT 

208
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:52,985
SYMBOLICALLY, IT WAS SO 

209
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,520
IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO HAVE BOTH 

210
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,055
OF THOSE FORMER PRESIDENTS WHO 

211
00:10:57,055 --> 00:11:01,927
HE RAN AGAINST AND LOST TO, ONE 

212
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,295
VERY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN.

213
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,364
ONE A PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT.

214
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,833
HE WANTED TO HAVE BOTH OF THEM 

215
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,234
COME TOGETHER AND TO SPEAK AT 

216
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:11,203
HIS MEMORIAL.

217
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,305
AND I THINK THAT WAS A LARGE 

218
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,808
PART OF WHAT WAS BEHIND JOE 

219
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,343
BIDEN SPEAKING OUT IN ARIZONA, 

220
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:18,977
BUT HE WAS SOMEBODY THAT TOUCHED

221
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:22,248
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY.

222
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,049
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM 

223
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:24,816
PERSONALLY, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE 

224
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:28,854
WHO SIMPLY KNEW HIS STORY, AND 

225
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,157
THIS WAS HIS FINAL MOMENT.

226
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,291
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING 

227
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,759
TRANSPIRE THIS WEEK.

228
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,828
DESIGNED AND CHOREOGRAPHED BY 

229
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,263
JOHN McCAIN HIMSELF.

230
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,663
>> WE'RE GETTING OUR FIRST LOOK 

231
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:40,999
AT CINDY McCAIN WITH THEIR SONS 

232
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:44,003
JACK AND JIMMY AT THE TOP OF THE

233
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:44,303
STEPS THERE.

234
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,871
THE FIRST GLIMPSES WE ARE 

235
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,540
GETTING OF THE McCAIN FAMILY AS 

236
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,910
THEY ARE SET TO ENTER THE 

237
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,143
ROTUNDA.

238
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,345
SO MUCH OF TODAY IS ABOUT 

239
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,580
TRADITION.

240
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,616
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT BEING 

241
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:58,417
THERE FOR 150 YEARS, AND 

242
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,952
SOMETHING WILL BE DIFFERENT.

243
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:01,586
THAT'S THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE

244
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:02,588
COUNTRY IS NOT GOING TO BE 

245
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:02,955
THERE.

246
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:03,589
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WILL 

247
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,659
BE THERE, AND THE PRESIDENT SAID

248
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,762
HE IS SENDING GENERAL JOHN 

249
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:10,729
KELLY, ALONG WITH JOHN BOLTON, 

250
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,931
BUT HE WILL NOT BE THERE, AND HE

251
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,300
IS IN WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW, JON.

252
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,801
>> Reporter: AND THIS IS -- 

253
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:16,702
THERE IS A COUPLE OF THINGS 

254
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:17,336
GOING ON THERE.

255
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,506
ONE IS CLEARLY PRESIDENT DONALD 

256
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,374
TRUMP DOESN'T -- NEVER HAS HAD 

257
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,009
MUCH OF A HIGH OPINION OR 

258
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,510
RESPECT FOR THAT MATTER, FOR 

259
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,346
JOHN McCAIN.

260
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,949
OBVIOUSLY FAMOUSLY DURING THE 

261
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,450
CAMPAIGN SAID THAT HE, YOU KNOW,

262
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,686
AS FAR AS WAR HEROES, HE PREFERS

263
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,354
PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T CAPTURED, 

264
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:37,723
SOMETHING THAT WASN'T SIMPLY A 

265
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,558
SLIP OF THE TONGUE.

266
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,027
IT'S SOMETHING HE HAD SAID 

267
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,963
ON "60 MINUTES" WAY BACK IN 

268
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,464
1999.

269
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,498
KIND OF A DEEPLY FELT LACK OF 

270
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:48,167
RESPECT, BUT THE FEELING RAN 

271
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:52,204
BOTH WAYS, AND McCAIN -- AND AS 

272
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,007
YOU SEE REALLY QUITE A MOMENT 

273
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:55,941
AGAIN COMING.

274
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,509
HIS CASKET ABOUT TO COME OUT OF 

275
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:00,779
THAT HEARSE AND TO GO INTO THAT 

276
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,581
CAPITOL BUILDING FOR THE LAST 

277
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,284
TIME.

278
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,288
JOHN McCAIN, HE PLANNED THESE 

279
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,123
EVENTS, HE MADE IT CLEAR THROUGH

280
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,391
FRIENDS HE DIDN'T MORELY WANT 

281
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:12,958
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

282
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,693
STATES TAKING PART IN THIS.

283
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,795
>> EVEN FROM THE GRAVE, REFUSING

284
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,497
TO BUILD A BRIDGE WITH THE 

285
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,098
PRESIDENT.

286
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,033
THAT RELATIONSHIP WAS JUST TOO 

287
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:21,333
FRACTURED.

288
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,968
AS JON MENTIONED, WE ARE GETTING

289
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,938
OUR FIRST LOOK NOW AT THE CASKET

290
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:26,572
THAT'S ABOUT TO COME OUT OF THE 

291
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,307
HEARSE AND ENTER THE ROTUNDA.

292
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,310
IT WILL LIE IN STATE ALL DAY.

293
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,645
FOR FIRST HIS FAMILY AND 

294
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,613
COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE AND THE

295
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,281
HOUSE, AND SOME OF THE 

296
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,350
ADMINISTRATION TO COME AND PAY 

297
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:38,951
THEIR RESPECTS.

298
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,453
THERE IS A SERVICE, ABOUT 30 

299
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:45,658
MINUTES WHERE THE CHAPLAIN WILL 

300
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,292
SPEAK, THE SENATE CHAPLAIN WHO 

301
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,626
USED TO BE THE NAVY CHAPLAIN AS 

302
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,427
WELL.

303
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:52,564
BARRY BLACK, A DECORATED NAVY 

304
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:53,465
VETERAN, REVERED ADMIRAL, AND 

305
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,768
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SENATE 

306
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,602
MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL,

307
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:00,706
HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN AND VICE

308
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:04,743
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE AS WELL AS 

309
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,076
CHUCK SCHUMER.

310
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:05,777
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR 

311
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,980
THE STORIES AND MEMORIES THEY 

312
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,782
SHARE AS WE WATCH THIS POIGNANT 

313
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,015
MOMENT.

314
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,317
COKIE, YOUR THOUGHTS AS THE 

315
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,218
EVENTS OF TODAY ARE ABOUT TO 

316
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:13,418
BEGIN.

317
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,454
>> THIS IS A DIFFICULT MOMENT.

318
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,389
AS JON SAID COMING TO THE 

319
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,490
CAPITOL FOR THE LAST TIME, AND 

320
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,624
IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT FOR 

321
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:22,127
THESE PALLBEARERS CARRYING HIM 

322
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,896
UP THESE LONG STEPS INTO THE 

323
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,198
ROTUNDA, AND THE ROTUNDA ITSELF 

324
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,534
IS SUCH A SPECIAL PLACE.

325
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,968
I THINK JOHN McCAIN WOULD HAVE 

326
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,804
MUCH PREFERRED TO BE WALKING 

327
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,138
THROUGH IT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF 

328
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,275
THE CAPITOL TO TAKE THE OATH OF 

329
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,342
OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE 

330
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:38,343
UNITED STATES, BUT THAT WAS NOT 

331
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:41,380
TO BE, AND NOW HE WILL BE 

332
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,682
HONORED IN THE WAY THAT OTHERS 

333
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:44,984
HAVE BEEN HONORED UNDER PICTURES

334
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:51,323
THAT MATTER A GREAT DEAL.

335
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,593
OF -- PICTURES THAT ARE GEORGE 

336
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:55,995
WASHINGTON SURRENDERING HIS 

337
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,497
COMMISSION SAYING, THIS IS NOT 

338
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,531
GOING TO BE A MILITARY 

339
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,467
GOVERNMENT.

340
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,101
THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOVERNMENT

341
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,969
OF CONSENT BY THE PEOPLE, AND 

342
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,605
JOHN McCAIN UNDERSTOOD WHEN HIS 

343
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,706
MILITARY CAREER WAS OVER THAT 

344
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,475
THE WAY THAT HE COULD SERVE THE 

345
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:13,412
COUNTRY WAS THROUGH THAT CONSENT

346
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:13,945
OF THE VOTERS OF ARIZONA.

347
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:16,181
>> AS THE RAIN HAS STARTED TO 

348
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,717
FALL IN WASHINGTON, WE'RE GOING 

349
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:19,351
TO WATCH THIS MOMENT AND PAUSE 

350
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:32,598
FOR A SECOND.

351
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,272
>> AS WE WATCH THIS, YOU HAVE TO

352
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,207
ADMIRE THE DILIGENCE AND THE 

353
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,543
DISCIPLINE OF OUR MEN FROM THE 

354
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,878
NAVY HERE THAT ARE CARRYING THE 

355
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:53,879
CASKET, CARRYING SENATOR JOHN 

356
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,147
McCAIN INTO THE ROTUNDA AS THE 

357
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,548
RAIN IS STARTING TO FALL EVEN 

358
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,650
HARDER THERE IN WASHINGTON, 

359
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,486
MAKING SURE THEY DON'T MISS A 

360
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:00,752
STEP.

361
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:01,352
MARCHING IN PRECISE, PERFECT 

362
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:04,890
ORDER.

363
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,824
THOUGH SENATOR McCAIN SERVED THE

364
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,626
PEOPLE OF ARIZONA, HE ALSO 

365
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,393
SERVED THE PEOPLE OF THIS 

366
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:10,328
COUNTRY, AND IN MANY WAYS, 

367
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:11,696
JONATHAN KARL, SENATOR JOHN 

368
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:13,898
McCAIN IS COMING HOME BECAUSE HE

369
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:16,001
WAS SO MUCH A FIXTURE OF 

370
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,001
WASHINGTON, SO MUCH A FIXTURE OF

371
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:19,237
THE CAPITOL AND THE SENATE 

372
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:19,872
FLOOR.

373
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,772
>> Reporter: SO MUCH A FIXTURE 

374
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:23,141
OF THE CAPITOL, THE PEOPLE WHO 

375
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:28,280
WORKED THERE, NOT MERELY HIS 

376
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,181
COLLEAGUES, DEMOCRATS AND 

377
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,549
REPUBLICANS, NOT MERELY THE 

378
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,451
STAFF THAT RUN THE PLACE, BUT 

379
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,086
THE PEOPLE THAT WORKED THERE.

380
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:35,720
I MEAN I SAW HIM AND I WALKED 

381
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,823
ALL OVER THE CAPITOL WITH JOHN 

382
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:41,160
McCAIN AND RODE THE CAPITOL 

383
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,227
SUBWAY FROM THE CAPITOL BUILDING

384
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,996
TO THE RUSSELL SENATE BUILDING 

385
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,764
WHERE HE HAD HIS OFFICE FOR SO 

386
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,432
MANY YEARS, AND WHERE THERE IS A

387
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:49,234
MOVEMENT NOW TO TRY TO RENAME 

388
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,437
THE BUILDING THE McCAIN SENATE 

389
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:52,837
OFFICE BUILDING.

390
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:56,775
HE HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 

391
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,610
PEOPLE THAT -- THAT DROVE THE 

392
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,811
SUBWAY, THE LITTLE SUBWAY THAT 

393
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:02,047
WENT BETWEEN THE CAPITOL AND 

394
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,781
THAT BUILDING, THE POLICE 

395
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:05,851
OFFICERS THAT GUARDED THE 

396
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,587
BUILDING, THE PEOPLE THAT WORKED

397
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,288
IN THE -- IN THE LITTLE 

398
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:12,191
CAFETERIAS IN THE CAPITOL.

399
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,859
THEY ALL KNEW HIM.

400
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,927
HE KNEW THEM.

401
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:19,631
HE ALWAYS HAD A WORD TO SAY TO 

402
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:19,898
THEM.

403
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:26,538
THIS WAS -- THIS WAS A PLACE 

404
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,172
THAT REALLY GREW -- AS I SAID --

405
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:27,705
GREW TO LOVE JOHN McCAIN.

406
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:28,974
EVEN AS HE WAGED SOME PRETTY 

407
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,310
EPIC BATTLES, TOM, IN THAT 

408
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,345
BUILDING, AND RUFFLED A LOT OF 

409
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,048
FEATHERS, AND IRRITATED A LOT OF

410
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,149
HIS COLLEAGUES.

411
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,352
BUT ULTIMATELY, LOOK AT THEM 

412
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:40,552
THERE.

413
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,255
ABOVE ALL, ABOVE ALL, IT WAS 

414
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,758
RESPECT THAT THEY HAD FOR JOHN 

415
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,061
McCAIN.

416
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,897
>> WE ARE SEEING JOHN KELLY 

417
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,031

00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,511
ROD ROSENSTEIN AS WELL.

425
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:07,746
SOMEWHAT OF AN UNEXPECTED 

426
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:08,580
TURNOUT WITH SOME OF THE 

427
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,782
ADMINISTRATION HERE, BUT CLEARLY

428
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:11,282
SHOWING THEIR RESPECTS.

429
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:13,952
GOVERNOR SCOTT OF FLORIDA THERE,

430
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,353
GOVERNOR DUCEY AS WELL OF 

431
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:16,989

COKIE ROBERTS.

434
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,298
IT'S STANDING ROOM ONLY.

435
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:28,567
THEY LEAVE THE CENTER COMPLETELY

436
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,203
OPEN FOR SENATOR McCAIN AND HIS 

437
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:31,737
RIGHT PLACE.

438
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,705
>> RIGHT THERE AS YOU SAY THAT 

439
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:38,043
WAS QUICKLY BUILT FOR ABRAHAM 

440
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:38,710
LINCOLN, AND UNTIL RECENTLY WAS 

441
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,679
KEPT UNDERNEATH THE DOME IN A 

442
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,749
KIND OF CREEPY PLACE IN THE 

443
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,517
UNITED STATES CAPITAL, BUT NOW 

444
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:54,192

446
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,961

447
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,062
>> PEOPLE OF BOTH PARTIES, 

448
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:01,233
REALLY THERE TO SAY GOOD-BYE, 

449
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,436
AND THAT REALLY SHOWS YOU HOW 

450
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,904
McCAIN DID CROSS THAT LINE.

451
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:11,643
THIS IS NOT A REPUBLICAN EVENT.

452
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:12,210
THE MINORITY LEADER OF THE 

453
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:12,811
SENATE CHUCK SCHUMER WE JUST 

454
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:12,978
SAW.

455
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,079
HERE COMES THE FAMILY, AND THEY 

456
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,748
ARE SITTING UNDER PICTURES BY 

457
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,783
THE WAY OF COLUMBUS COMING TO 

458
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:21,620
AMERICA AND OF POCAHONTAS SAVING

459
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,623

00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:24,990
JAMESTOWN.

461
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,127
SO THE EARLIEST PICTURES OF 

462
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,428
EUROPEANS IN AMERICA ARE OVER 

463
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:33,431
THE FAMILY AS THEY COME IN TO 

464
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:36,435
HAVE THIS CEREMONY.

465
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,670
THE LAST CIVIC CEREMONY BEFORE 

466
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,837
THE RELIGIOUS CEREMONY.

467
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:41,606
>> AND COKIE, AS YOU WERE 

468
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:44,042
TALKING, I WAS NOTICING THE 

469
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,277
ENTIRE McCAIN FAMILY WALKING IN,

470
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,211
AND SOMEBODY WAS SITTING DOWN 

471
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,279
AND I WAS WONDERING WHO THAT 

472
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,780
WAS, AND THAT OF COURSE, IS 

473
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,649
SENATOR McCAIN'S MOTHER, 106 

474
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,150
YEARS OLD.

475
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,184
ROBERTA McCAIN WHO HAS LIVED 

476
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:55,620
SUCH AN INCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLE 

477
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,054
LIFE.

478
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,657
HER HUSBAND OF COURSE, NAVY 

479
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:58,890
ADMIRAL.

480
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,292
SHE WAS MARRIED TO THE NAVY.

481
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,727
SHE TRAVELED ALL OVER THE WORLD 

482
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:03,327
AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN 

483
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:04,663
SERVICE WITH HER FAMILY.

484
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,264
YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE DIRECTLY

485
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:06,965
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN 

486
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:10,202
SITTING DOWN.

487
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:10,836
AGAIN, 106 YEARS YOUNG I SHOULD 

488
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,171
SAY, AND SHE ALSO HAD TO 

489
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,807
WITHSTAND AND STAY STRONG WHILE 

490
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,443
HER SON WAS IN A VIETNAMESE 

491
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,678
PRISON CAMP FOR 5 1/2 YEARS AND 

492
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,780
SHE HAD TO ENDURE THAT, AND 

493
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,580
SENATOR McCAIN WOULD ALWAYS 

494
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,050
SHARE INTERESTING STORIES ABOUT 

495
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,418
HER HOW WHEN SHE WENT TO EUROPE 

496
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,054
AND SHE WAS TOO OLD TO RENT A 

497
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:32,123
CAR, SO SHE BOUGHT A CAR AND SHE

498
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:34,192
WAS DRIVING ACROSS THE COUNTRY 

499
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,429
IN HER 90s, BUT CLEARLY SOMEBODY

500
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,597
WHO WAS OF STRONG CHARACTER, AND

501
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,899
SOMEBODY WHO SHE TOO HAS SERVED 

502
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,367
THIS COUNTRY, AND NOW HAS TO 

503
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,034
WITNESS THIS.

504
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:44,770
NO DOUBT, A TOUGH MOMENT FOR 

505
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,705
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THAT 

506
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:48,339
FAMILY, INCLUDING OF COURSE, OUR

507
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:51,243
COLLEAGUE MEGHAN McCAIN.

508
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,678
EARLIER WE SAW CHUCK SCHUMER WHO

509
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:54,579
JON HAD MENTIONED THEY CHANGE 

510
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,014

00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,583
BUILDING TO THE McCAIN SENATE 

512
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:58,850
BUILDING.

513
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,053
THAT OF COURSE, WILL TAKE SOME 

514
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:02,253
TIME.

515
00:22:02,253 --> 00:22:02,853
SENATOR McCONNELL HAS TABLED 

516
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:04,256
THAT FOR THE MOMENT TO SEE WHAT 

517
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,824
HAPPENS WITH THAT, BUT IT WOULD 

518
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,058
BE ONE OF MANY HONORS THAT THEY 

519
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:09,294
WOULD LIKE TO MEMORIALIZE 

520
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,595
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, AND 

521
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:11,496
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD SEE 

522
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,198
HAPPEN IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

523
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:17,135
AS WE LOOK AT ALL THE DEMOCRATS,

524
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:21,239
NANCY PELOSI, REPRESENTATIVE JOE

525
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,541

00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,176
THIS CEREMONY IS SET TO GET 

527
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,410

THE INVOCATION WILL BE GIVEN BY 

529
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:31,216

538
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,230

539
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,931

540
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:49,034

YOU SEE DIANNE FEINSTEIN, AND 

545
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:04,850
JON KARL JOINING US NOW.

546
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,619
IT'S A COLLECTION OF THE FACES 

547
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,620
WE KNOW IN WASHINGTON, AND 

548
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,055
SENATOR McCAIN HAD TO WORK WITH 

549
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:13,491
AND FIGHT WITH DURING HIS TIME 

550
00:23:13,491 --> 00:23:13,825
IN THE SENATE.

551
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:14,559
>> Reporter: I'M STRUCK THINKING

552
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,496
OF A LINE THAT McCAIN OFTEN 

553
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:17,696
USED.

554
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,664
HE SAID THAT HE NEVER -- HE WAS 

555
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:23,101
NEVER ELECTED MR. CONGENIALITY 

556
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,236
OF THE SENATE.

557
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,306
HE LOVED TO FIGHT, AND IN HIS 

558
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,743
LAST BOOK, "THE RESTLESS WAVE," 

559
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,579
HE SAID HIS ENJOYMENT OF A FIGHT

560
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:38,416
WAS IN HIS CHANCES TO WINNING 

561
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:38,683
THE FIGHT.

562
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,551
WHEN I LOOK AND I SEE THESE 

563
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,387
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THESE 

564
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,189
SENATORS OF BOTH PARTIES, SOME 

565
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:48,293
OF WHOM FOUGHT MIGHTILY WITH 

566
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:51,830
McCAIN COME IN AND SHOW RESPECT 

567
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,231
FOR SOMEBODY WHO, YOU KNOW, 

568
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:56,701
McCAIN -- AND THERE YOU SEE VICE

569
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,337
PRESIDENT PENCE COMING IN 

570
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,607
REPRESENTING THE WHITE HOUSE AT 

571
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,276
THIS CEREMONY.

572
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,209
McCAIN WAS SOMEBODY WHO ALWAYS 

573
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:06,611
SEEMED TO BE IN A HURRY.

574
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,614
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER HAD A TOUGH 

575
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:09,914
RE-ELECTION.

576
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:11,650
HE WON -- HE WON IN ARIZONA.

577
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,017
HE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A SCARE 

578
00:24:13,017 --> 00:24:15,387
LAST TIME AROUND, BUT ULTIMATELY

579
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,322
HE WON EVERY RACE BY TEN POINTS 

580
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,057
OR MORE.

581
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,792
BUT HE ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE A GUY 

582
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,960
THAT WAS IN A HURRY.

583
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,195
YOU HAD TO ALMOST KIND OF SPRINT

584
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,930
TO KEEP UP WITH HIM WHILE 

585
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,466
WALKING THROUGH THE CORRIDORS OF

586
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,801
THE CAPITOL.

587
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,102
HE WANTED TO DO THINGS.

588
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,136
HE WANTED TO -- AS HE WOULD SAY 

589
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:35,507
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, ENCOURAGE 

590
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,577
US TO DEDICATE OUR LIVES TO A 

591
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,645
CAUSE GREATER THAN OURSELVES, 

592
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,082
AND HE FELT THAT HE HAD SURVIVED

593
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,051
THAT HORRIFIC ORDEAL IN VIETNAM.

594
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,819
HE WAS NOT GOING TO WASTE HIS 

595
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,453
TIME NOW THAT HE HAD BEEN GIVEN 

596
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:51,956
THIS -- WHAT HE SAW AS A GREAT 

597
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:53,925
HONOR OF REPRESENTING THE STATE 

598
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,860
OF ARIZONA IN THE UNITED STATES 

599
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,127
SENATE.

600
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,762
HE WAS GOING TO MAKE THE MOST OF

601
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,564
IT, EVEN IF THAT MEANT CLASHING 

602
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,900
AND RUNNING A BIT LIKE A BULL IN

603
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,404
A CHINA SHOP IN THE SENATE, AND 

604
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,372
GOING UP AGAINST HIS COLLEAGUES 

605
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:10,075
IN BOTH PARTIES.

606
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:14,980
HE WAS GOING TO GET THINGS DONE.

607
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,247
AND FIGHT.

608
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,616
HE LOVED TO FIGHT, AND HERE THEY

609
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,151
ALL ARE, THOSE -- HIS FORMER 

610
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,587
SPARRING PARTNERS AND FRIENDS.

611
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,588
SHOWING THEIR RESPECT.

612
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,991
>> AND HERE IT IS.

613
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,493
THE CASKET CARRYING THE SENATOR 

614
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,161
JOHN McCAIN AS HE ENTERS THE 

615
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,062
ROTUNDA AS HE IS ABOUT TO LIE IN

616
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:47,078
STATE.

617
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,852
>> AND LOOK AT THIS IMAGE RIGHT 

618
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:01,052
HERE.

619
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,420
HIS FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES, 

620
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,755
THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR HEART.

621
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,690
YOU MAY HAVE DISAGREED WITH 

622
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,624
SENATOR McCAIN'S POLITICS.

623
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,892
YOU MAY HAVE AGREED WITH THEM, 

624
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,662
BUT YOU COULD NEVER DOUBT THIS 

625
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,530
MAN WAS A PATRIOT, COKIE 

626
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:12,763
ROBERTS.

627
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:14,132
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, AND 

628
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,801
LOOKING AT THAT LINEUP OF 

629
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,368
DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN 

630
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:19,804
SENATORS AND SOME OF THEIR WIVES

631
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,173
WAS REALLY QUITE STRIKING, BUT 

632
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,908
THIS WHOLE CEREMONY OF THE ROLE 

633
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:26,578
OF THE MILITARY IS ALSO 

634
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,379
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY 

635
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:30,615
IMPRESSIVE, OF COURSE.

636
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,617
BUT SO APPROPRIATE FOR JOHN 

637
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:35,286
McCAIN WHO WAS OF COURSE, NOT 

638
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,856
ONLY SUCH A HERO HIMSELF IN THE 

639
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,125
MILITARY, BUT THE CHILD OF THE 

640
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:40,859
MILITARY.

641
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,094
YOU SEE SITTING IN THE LAST 

642
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,131
PICTURE YOU SAW SITTING IN A 

643
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:46,765
WHEE

644
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:50,235
WHEELCHAIR, SENATOR TAMMY 

645
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,737
DUCKWORTH WHO WAS SEVERELY 

646
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:55,006
INJURED IN THE IRAQ WAR, LOSING 

647
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,641
LEGS AND AN ARM, AND SHE HAS 

648
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:00,245
TALKED ABOUT WHAT AN INSPIRATION

649
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,579
JOHN McCAIN WAS TO HER, AND HOW 

650
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,349
HE ALWAYS REACHED OUT TO HER AND

651
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,284
ENCOURAGED HER EVEN THOUGH SHE 

652
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,485
WAS A DEMOCRAT BECAUSE HE 

653
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,853
UNDERSTOOD WHAT SHE HAD 

654
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:09,120
SUFFERED.

655
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,924
>> AND COKIE, AS WE WATCH THE 

656
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,625
CAPITOL POLICE HONOR GUARD TAKE 

657
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,860
OVER FOR THE NAVY HONOR GUARD, 

658
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,363
I'M REMINDED OF HOW MANY THINGS 

659
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,297
HAPPENED IN SENATOR JOHN 

660
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,432
McCAIN'S LIFE FOR THIS MOMENT 

661
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:23,468
RIGHT HERE TO HAVE NOT HAPPENED.

662
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,337
HE GRADUATED AT THE BOTTOM OF 

663
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,805
HIS CLASS AT THE NAVAL ACADEMY, 

664
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:31,810
AND TALKED ABOUT SHOT DOWN THE.

665
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,112
HE GOT INTO POLITICS, AND LED AN

666
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,313
INCREDIBLE LIFE.

667
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,347
LET'S LISTEN IN.

668
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:42,554
>> WE GIVE YOU THANKS, ALMIGHTY 

669
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,954
GOD, FOR THE APPEARANCE OF US, 

670
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:47,158
GREAT MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE AS

671
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:47,792
INSPIRATIONS FOR ALL AMERICANS 

672
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:51,663
TO BE THEIR BEST IN SERVICE TO 

673
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,866
GOD, COUNTRY AND NEIGHBOR.

674
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,668
THIS DAY, WE HONOR A TRUE 

675
00:28:57,668 --> 00:29:02,273
AMERICAN HERO, SENATOR JOHN 

676
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:02,607
McCAIN.

677
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,276
HE DEDICATED HIS ENTIRE LIFE TO 

678
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:10,582
PUBLIC SERVICE AS A VOCATION, 

679
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,249
FIRST IN THE MILITARY, AND THEN 

680
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,483
IN ELECTED OFFICE.

681
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:19,824
HE PLACED HIMSELF DIRECTLY IN 

682
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:20,458
HARM'S WAY DURING THE VIETNAM 

683
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,159
WAR AND HIS GREAT SACRIFICE OF 

684
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,796
PERSONAL FREEDOM IS WELL KNOWN.

685
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:28,766
AS A SENATOR, HE SERVED WITH 

686
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:32,303
HONESTY AND INTEGRITY, WORKING 

687
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,138
BOTH WITH THOSE WITH WHOM HE 

688
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:36,808
AGREED AND MANY WITH WHOM HE DID

689
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:36,974
NOT.

690
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:40,211
HIS WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK THE 

691
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,579
TRUTH AS HE UNDERSTOOD IT, EVEN 

692
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:44,582
WHEN IT WAS NOT POLITICALLY 

693
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:48,586
EXPEDIENT TO DO SO PROVED TO BE 

694
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,623
A RARE PHENOMENON.

695
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,592
FOR THAT REASON, IT WAS ALL THE 

696
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,495
MORE PRECIOUS.

697
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:00,931
AS WE CONTINUE THIS CELEBRATION 

698
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:04,569
OF HONOR GRANT THAT ALL WHO 

699
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,303
ATTEND TO THESE PROCEEDINGS 

700
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,072
MIGHT TRANSCEND SMALLNESS AND 

701
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,875
LIMITATION AND EMERGE AS PEOPLE 

702
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:15,780
DESIROUS OF BEING OUR BEST

MIGHT CALL EACH OF US TO BE.

706
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:25,589
DEAR LORD, THANK YOU FOR

WELCOME YOU THIS MORNING.

717
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,470
WE GATHER TO RECOGNIZE A GREAT

00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:17,742
LOSS AND CELEBRATE A GREAT LIFE.

719
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,677
WE CELEBRATE SIX DECADES OF 

720
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:23,815
DEVOTION TO THE AMERICAN IDEA 

721
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:30,621
AND THE CAUSE OF HUMAN FREEDOM.

722
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:32,757
GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HWILL 

723
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:33,491
CONTINUE TO MARVEL AT THE MAN 

724
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:38,429
WHO LIES BEFORE US.

725
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,132
A COCKY, HANDSOME, NAVAL AVIATOR

726
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,300
WHO BARELY SCRAPED THROUGH 

727
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,569
SCHOOL AND THEN FOUGHT FOR 

728
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:49,841
FREEDOM IN THE SKIES.

729
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,944
WHO WITNESSED OUR HOUSE VALUES 

730
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:53,877
EVEN THROUGH TERRIBLE TORTURE 

731
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:58,583
AND BECAME A GENERATIONAL LEADER

732
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,817
IN OUR UNITED STATES SENATE 

733
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:05,790
WHERE OUR NATION AIRS ITS GREAT 

734
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,023
DEBATES.

735
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:08,259
NOW THAT IS A GENTLE WAY TO 

736
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,728
DESCRIBE OHOW JOHN APPROACHED TE

737
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,362
WORK OF A SENATOR.

738
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:18,136
I HAVE LONG JOKED THAT THE HOUSE

739
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:18,869
PROBABLY NEEDED GROUP THERAPY 

740
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:22,173
AFTER JOHN WAS FINISHED WITH 

741
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:22,373
THEM.

742
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,708
LET'S JUST SAY THERE WERE TIMES 

743
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,942
WHEN SOME OF HIS SENATE 

744
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:26,411
COLLEAGUES WERE TEMPTED TO 

745
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,046
PERFORM A SUPPORT GROUP OF OUR 

746
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:28,513
OWN.

747
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:31,649
HE TREATED EVERY ISSUE WITH THE 

748
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,585
INTENSITY THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS 

749
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:34,852
DESERVED.

750
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:35,452
HE WOULD FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL 

751
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:39,791
FOR HIS VISION OF THE COMMON 

752
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,225
GOOD DEPENDING ON THE ISSUE, YOU

753
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,195
KNEW JOHN WOULD EITHER BE YOUR 

754
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,597
STAUNCHEST ALLY OR YOUR MOST 

755
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:51,035
STUBBORN OPPONENT.

756
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:51,569
AS

757
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,204
AT ANY MOMENT HE MIGHT BE 

758
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,473
PREPARING AN ELOQUENT REFLECTION

759
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,808
ON HUMAN LIBERTY OR A 

760
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:00,645
DEVASTATING JOKE SERVED UP WITH 

761
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,712
HIS SIGNATURE CACKLE AND THAT 

762
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:06,517
JOHN McCAIN GLINT IN HIS EYE.

763
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:07,050
HE HAD AMERICA'S FIGHTING 

764
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,854
SPIRIT, OUR NOBLE IDEALISM, OUR 

765
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:13,624
SOLEMN PATRIOTISM AND OUR 

766
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:17,728
SLIGHTLY IRREVERENT STREAK, ALL 

767
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:18,429
ROLLED INTO ONE.

768
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,866
I WILL MISS A DEAR FRIEND WHOSE 

769
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,401
SMILE REMINDED US THAT SERVICE 

770
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:28,306
IS A PRIVILEGE, AND WHOSE SCARS 

771
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:28,906
REMINDED US OF THE GREAT COST 

772
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,075
THAT BRAVE SOULS PAY FOR OUR 

773
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,376
FREEDOM.

774
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:34,579
JOHN FELT LIKE FAMILY, BUT OF 

775
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:41,652

00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,791
MEGHAN, JACK, JIMMY AND BRIDGET

00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:51,996
WHO CAN TRULY CALL THIS MAN 

779
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:52,497
THEIR OWN.

780
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,867
ON BEHALF OF THE SENATE AND THE 

781
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,536
ENTIRE NATION, THANK YOU.

782
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,305
THANK YOU FOR LENDING HIM TO US 

783
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,041
LONGER THAN WE HAD A RIGHT.

784
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,743
THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING HIM 

785
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:09,380
WHILE HE SUPPORTED US.

786
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,417
HALF A WORLD AWAY, WEARING OUR 

787
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:14,452
NATION'S UNIFORM, JOHN McCAIN 

788
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,021
STOOD UP FOR EVERY VALUE THAT 

789
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:21,458
THIS CAPITOL BUILDING 

790
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:21,792
REPRESENTS.

791
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:24,395
THEN HE BROUGHT THAT SAME 

792
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:28,032
PATRIOTISM INSIDE ITS WALLS TO 

793
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,033
ADVOCATE FOR OUR SERVICE 

794
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:32,503
MEMBERS, OUR VETERANS AND OUR 

795
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,505
MORAL LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD.

796
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,308
SO IT IS ONLY RIGHT THAT TODAY 

797
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:40,710
NEAR THE END OF HIS LONG JOURNEY

798
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:45,216
JOHN LIES HERE IN THIS GREAT 

799
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:48,719
HALL UNDER THIS MIGHTY DOME LIKE

800
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,319
OTHER AMERICAN HEROES BEFORE 

801
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:54,592
HIM.

802
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,360
HERE AS A RESTLESS WAVE 

803
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,665
APPROACHES THE SHORES OF 

804
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,533
ETERNITY, WE THANK GOD FOR 

805
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:21,385
GIVING THIS COUNTRY JOHN McCAIN.

806
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,855
>> ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL 

807
00:35:24,855 --> 00:35:28,359
NATION AND ON BEHALF OF 

808
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,361
CONGRESS, I WANT TO BEGIN BY 

809
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,929
GIVING THANKS TO THE McCAIN 

810
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:32,396
FAMILY.

811
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:37,868
FOR YOUR MANY YEARS OFF SERVICE 

812
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:38,603
TO OUR COUNTRY.

813
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:42,106
WE SHARE YOUR ANGUISH IN LOSING 

814
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,975
THIS GREAT MAN.

815
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,545
RARELY DOES THIS GLORIOUS 

816
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,881
ROTUNDA FALL SILENT AT THIS 

817
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:50,081
HOUR.

818
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,549
ON A DAY LIKE THIS, JOHN WOULD 

819
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,749
USUALLY BE BOUNDING THIS WAY OR 

820
00:35:52,749 --> 00:35:55,152
THAT WAY, RIGHT THROUGH HERE.

821
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,154
VISITORS TURNING TO EACH OTHER, 

822
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:59,890
ASKING IF THAT'S WHO THEY THINK 

823
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:04,462
IT IS, BUT IN THIS QUIET HOUR, 

824
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,164
WE ARE LEFT TO PONDER HOW HIS 

825
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:12,403
LIFE SPEAKS TO US.

826
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,038
JOHN McCAIN DESERVES TO BE 

827
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:21,279
REMEMBERED AS HE WISHED TO BE 

828
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:22,580
REMEMBERED, A POATRIOT WHO SERVD

829
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,948
HIS COUNTRY.

830
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:24,948
A MAN YES OF THE SENATE, BUT 

831
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:28,819
ALSO A MAN OF THE HOUSE.

832
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:32,423
A NAVY MAN, A FAMILY MAN.

833
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:35,959
A MAN WHO MADE AN ENORMOUS 

834
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:38,496
DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF 

835
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,432
COUNTLESS PEOPLE.

836
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,668
A MAN OF CONVICTION.

837
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:49,940
A MAN OF STATE.

838
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,510
THERE IS A LINE FROM HIS 

839
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,177
FAREWELL STATEMENT THAT REALLY 

840
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:58,015
JUST GRABBED ME.

841
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,383
OUR IDENTITIES AND SENSE OF 

842
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:02,486
WORTH ARE NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED, BUT

843
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,788
ENLARGED BY SERVING BIG CAUSES 

844
00:37:04,788 --> 00:37:06,357
BIGGER THAN OURSELVES.

845
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,625
THAT'S JOHN McCAIN.

846
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:11,362
HOW FITTING AND HOW TRUE.

847
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,497
WHAT STANDS OUT ABOUT JOHN 

848
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:18,202
McCAIN IS WHAT HE STOOD FOR.

849
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,037
THE RICH BLESSINGS THAT ONLY 

850
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,540
FREEDOM CAN BESTOW.

851
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,743
THE SENSE OF PURPOSE THAT A 

852
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,744
BATTLE JOINED CAN BRING, THE 

853
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:29,547
COMMON HUMANITY THAT BURNS IN 

854
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:36,787
EACH OF OUR HEARTS.

855
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,423
HEMINGWAY ONCE WROTE, THE WORLD 

856
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,592
BREAKS EVERYONE AND AFTERWARD, 

857
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,128
MANY ARE STRONG AT THE BROKEN 

858
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:47,698
PLACES.

859
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,666
NO ONE, NO ONE WAS STRONGER AT 

860
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:50,468
THE BROKEN PLACES THAN JOHN 

861
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:54,638
McCAIN.

862
00:37:54,638 --> 00:38:02,646
THE BROKENNESS WAS HIS BAEST.

863
00:38:02,646 --> 00:38:05,783
HE NEVER LOST THE TIME, OR THE 

864
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,452
POLITICAL LIFE SANDS AWAY.

865
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,488
I MYSELF FROM TIME TO TIME, 

866
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:11,522
FOUND MYSELF ON THE RECEIVING 

867
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:14,491
END OF JOHN'S DISTINCT BRAND OF 

868
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:18,329
CONDOR.

869
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:19,230
HAPPILY SO.

870
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,132
I REMEMBER THINKING MORE THAN 

871
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:21,732
ONCE, YEAH.

872
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:26,570
HE REALLY DOES TALK LIKE A 

873
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:30,608
SAILOR, BUT YOU SEE WITH JOHN, 

874
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:34,845
IT WAS NEVER FEIGNED 

875
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:35,246
DISAGREEMENT.

876
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,446
THE MAN DIDN'T FEIGN ANYTHING.

877
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:38,982
HE JUST RELISHED THE FIGHT.

878
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:41,952
HE SHOWED US THAT IN THE ARENA, 

879
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:45,289
THE HONEST BACK AND FORTH, 

880
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:45,856
THAT'S WHERE THE CAUSE GETS 

881
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,359
BIGGER.

882
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,961
THAT'S WHERE THE TRIUMPH IS ALL 

883
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,563
THE SWEETER.

884
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,598
WE GET STRONGER AT THE BROKEN 

885
00:38:54,598 --> 00:39:01,305
PLACES.

886
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:01,805
HOE

887
00:39:01,805 --> 00:39:04,442
THOUGH THE HIGHEST OFFICE ELUDED

888
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,143
HIM, HE DETAINED WHAT IS FAR 

889
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,446
MORE ENDURING, THE ABIDING 

890
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:08,946
AFFECTION OF HIS FELLOW 

891
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:13,217
CITIZENS.

892
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,151
AND AN EXAMPLE FOR FUTURE 

893
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:17,288
GENERATIONS.

894
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:20,490
SO I THINK AHEAD NOW.

895
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,592
I THINK AHEAD OF THE DAY WHEN I 

896
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,460
LIKE SO MANY, WILL BRING MY OWN 

897
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,164
CHILDREN AND PERHAPS THEIR 

898
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,164
CHILDREN TO THAT HALLOWED LAWN 

899
00:39:28,164 --> 00:39:29,266
IN ANNAPOLIS.

900
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,269
I THINK ABOUT THAT.

901
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,839
I THINK ABOUT WHAT I MIGHT SAY 

902
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,343
TO THEM.

903
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,812
THIS IS ONE OF THE BRAVEST SOULS

904
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:49,186
OUR NATION HAS EVER PRODUCED.

905
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,255
HOWEVER YOU CHOOSE TO DO YOUR 

906
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,858
PART, I HOPE YOU DO IT THE WAY 

907
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:57,995
HE DID, WITH ENERGY AND URGENCY,

908
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:01,398
PLAYING FOR KEEPS, NEVER BACK ON

909
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:02,433
YOUR HEELS.

910
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,736
NEVER LETTING PRINCIPLE YIELD TO

911
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,637
EXPEDIENCE, RESISTING THE FALSE 

912
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:10,741
ALLURE OF THE FLEETING AND 

913
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,576
BATTENING DOWN THE HATCHES WHEN 

914
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,977
THINGS GET ROUGH, AND ALWAYS, 

915
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:14,578
ALWAYS HAVING A REALLY GOOD 

916
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:22,586
STORY TO TELL.

917
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,822
TODAY OUR NATION BOWS IN GRIEF, 

918
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:30,760
BUT HERE UNDER THIS WORK, AND IN

919
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,733
THE GAZE OF THE GREATS, FWHERE 

920
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,835
SOLDIERS KNOWN AND UNKNOWN HAVE 

921
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,003
LAID BEFORE, WE HAVE THIS 

922
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:39,870
BEAUTIFUL THING, THE CHANCE TO 

923
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:45,409
DO FOR THIS MAN WHAT HE DID FOR 

924
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,577
US, TO STAND UP.

925
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,779
TO STAND UP AND TO EMBRACE THE 

926
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,049
CAUSE OF HIS LIFE.

927
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,919
NO ONE OF US CAN FULFILL THIS 

928
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:58,589
CHARGE, BUT ALL OF US SURE CAN 

929
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:02,660
TRY.

930
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,397
BECAUSE ALL OF THIS, ALL OF 

931
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:10,534
THIS, IT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR.

932
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:15,105
GOD BLESS JOHN McCAIN, AND GOD 

933
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:18,575

934
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:34,592

00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:07,017
IT'S MY GREAT HONOR TO BE HERE.

961
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,352
IN THE LONG HISTORY OF OUR 

962
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:13,857

963
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,726

966
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,031
ESTEEM IN WHICH HIS COLLEAGUES 

967
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:24,735
AND OUR COUNTRY HOLD HIM, 

968
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:25,369
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN JOINS THOSE 

969
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:29,039
RANKS.

970
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,209
THE SON AND THE GRANDSON OF 

971
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,112
FOUR-STAR ADMIRALS, JOHN CAME 

972
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,582
FROM A FAMILY THAT PRIZED 

973
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:39,583
MILITARY SERVICE.

974
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:40,751
HE ENTERED THE UNITED STATES 

975
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:44,221
NAVAL ACADEMY WHEN HE WAS JUST 

976
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,657
17 YEARS OLD.

977
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:50,494
HIS SERVICE AS A NAVAL AVIATOR 

978
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,095
TOOK HIM AROUND THE WORLD AND 

979
00:43:52,095 --> 00:43:52,996
EVENTUALLY TO THE WAR IN VI

980
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:53,230
VIETNAM.

981
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,331
IT WAS THERE ON HIS 23rd BOMBING

982
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:58,202
RUN THAT JOHN WAS SHOT DOWN AND 

983
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:58,469
CAPTURED.

984
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,836
REFUSING EARLY RELEASE FOR THE 

985
00:43:59,836 --> 00:44:03,373
SAKE OF HIS COMRADES, HE ENDURED

986
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:08,612
5 1/2 YEARS OF CONFINEMENT AND 

987
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,115
TORTURE.

988
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,584
THEN AS NOW, AMERICANS MARVELLED

989
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:19,757
AT THE IRON WILL OF JOHN McCAIN,

990
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:22,525
BUT CAPTIVITY DID NOT DIMINISH 

991
00:44:22,525 --> 00:44:24,661
JOHN'S SENSE OF CALLING OR HIS 

992
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:27,798
COMMITMENT TO MISSION.

993
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:31,101
AS HE WOULD LATER SAY, I FELL IN

994
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,335
LOVE WITH ANY COUNTRY WHEN I WAS

995
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:37,441
A PRISONER IN SOMEONE ELSE'S.

996
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,444
AFTER HE MADE IT HOME, JOHN 

997
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:41,911
TRADED SERVICE IN THE UNIFORM OF

998
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:46,250

999
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,052
CONGRESS, EXCHANGING THE RANK OF

1000
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:50,587
CAPTAIN FOR CONGRESSMAN, AND 

1001
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:55,025
LATER SENATOR.

1002
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,026
FOR 35 YEARS, JOHN SERVED IN 

1003
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,528
THESE VERY HALLS UNDER THIS VERY

1004
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,998
DOME.

1005
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:05,869
AND HE FOUGHT FOR WHAT HE 

1006
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:06,169
BELIEVED IN.

1007
00:45:06,169 --> 00:45:10,474
IN MY YEARS IN CONGRESS AND AS 

1008
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:14,611
VICE PRESIDENT, WE DIDN'T ALWAYS

1009
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,381
AGREE EITHER, AND HE ALMOST 

1010
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,216
ALWAYS NOTICED, BUT HIS SUPPORT 

1011
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,586
FOR LIMITED GOVERNMENT, FOR TAX 

1012
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,688
REFORM AND SUPPORT FOR OUR ARMED

1013
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:28,158
FORCES SURELY LEFT OUR NATION 

1014
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,393
MORE PROSPEROUS AND MORE SECURE,

1015
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,930
AND HE WILL BE MISSED.

1016
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,598
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID 

1017
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,066
YESTERDAY, WE RESPECT HIS 

1018
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,636
SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY.

1019
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,205
LIKE MANY OF YOU GATHERED HERE, 

1020
00:45:42,205 --> 00:45:44,207
I ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF 

1021
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:45,609
TRAVELING WITH SENATOR McCAIN TO

1022
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:48,612
VISIT OUR TROOPS OVERSEAS.

1023
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:51,982
EARLIER THIS WEEK, I TOLD CINDY 

1024
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,851
OF A TIME ON A TRIP THROUGH IRAQ

1025
00:45:54,851 --> 00:45:58,589
AFTER ANOTHER 18-HOUR DAY.

1026
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,024
WHEN I WAS LITERALLY FALLING 

1027
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:05,295
ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF A DINNER

1028
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,897
WITH IRAQI OFFICIALS, AFTER THE 

1029
00:46:07,897 --> 00:46:09,999
DINNER JOHN WHO WAS MORE THAN 20

1030
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:13,704
YEARS OLDER THAN ME WALKED UP, 

1031
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:17,274
PUT HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND 

1032
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,842
SAID, MIKE, WE HAVE GOT A FEW 

1033
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,144
MORE MEETINGS TONIGHT, BUT WHY 

1034
00:46:21,144 --> 00:46:22,746
DON'T YOU TURN IN?

1035
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:26,583
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE SOME

1036
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:30,621
REST.

1037
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:34,224
THANKS, JOHN.

1038
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,326
HONESTLY, SEEING HIM DOWN RANGE,

1039
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,562
I NEVER TRAVELED WITH A 

1040
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,631
COLLEAGUE WHO WAS BETTER TO OUR 

1041
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,699
ENLISTED OR HARDER ON OUR 

1042
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,902
GENERALS.

1043
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,436
JOHN McCAIN LOVED THE MEN AND 

1044
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:49,739
WOMEN WHO SERVED IN THE UNIFORM 

1045
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:53,477
OF THE UNITED STATES, AND HE WAS

1046
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,611
A CHAMPION OF OUR ANTICRMED FOR 

1047
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:59,416
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER.

1048
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,517
IN EVERY GENERATION, THERE ARE 

1049
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:03,921
THOSE WHO PUT COUNTRY FIRST, WHO

1050
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:08,859
PRIZE SERVICE AHEAD OF SELF, WHO

1051
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:10,727
SUMMON IDEALISM FROM A CYNICAL 

1052
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:10,893
AGE.

1053
00:47:10,893 --> 00:47:16,333
JOHN McCAIN WAS SUCH A MAN.

1054
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,667
TODAY, HE LIES IN THE PLACE 

1055
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:22,506
WHERE HE SERVED TO THE LAST, THE

1056
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:26,810
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES.

1057
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,245
SOON HE WILL GO TO REST ON THE 

1058
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,781
GROUNDS WHERE HE SERVED FIRST, 

1059
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:35,285
THE UNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY.

1060
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,586
THE EYES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

1061
00:47:36,586 --> 00:47:41,858
WILL BE UPON HIM AS HE GOES, AND

1062
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:46,797
SO TOO WILL THEIR PRAYERS FOR 

1063
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,532

1064
00:47:49,532 --> 00:47:52,669
BELOVED FAMILY.

1065
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:53,904
GATHERED HERE TODAY, AND WE WILL

1066
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,906
PRAY THAT THOSE WHO MOURN SHALL 

1067
00:47:56,906 --> 00:48:01,912
BE COMFORTED.

1068
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:02,546
SO WE MOURN WITH THOSE WHO MOURN

1069
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,281
AND WE GRIEVE WITH THOSE WHO 

1070
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,116
GRIEVE, BUT WE DO NOT GRIEVE 

1071
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,451
LIKE THOSE WHO HAVE NO HOPE 

1072
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:11,921
BECAUSE JOHN McCAIN, LIKE 

1073
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:15,625
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, HELD FIRM

1074
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:17,594
TO THAT HOPE FROM AN OLD HYMN 

1075
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:20,530
THAT BECAME THE TITLE OF A BOOK 

1076
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:24,401
HE WROTE SOME 20 YEARS 

1077
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,037
AGO, "FAITH OF OUR FATHERS."

1078
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:32,542
THE FULL STANZA OF THAT HYMN 

1079
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,612

1080
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,881
LIVING STILL.

1081
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,318
IN SPITE OF DUNGEON, FIRE AND 

1082
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,352
SWORD.

1083
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:45,388
OH, HOW OUR HEARTS BEAT HIGH

00:48:45,388 --> 00:48:51,495
WITH JOY, WHENEVER HE HEAR THAT 

1085
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:51,828
GLORIOUS WORD.

1086
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:54,631
JOHN McCAIN HELD FIRM TO THAT 

1087
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:58,735
FAITH, THE FAITH OF HIS FATHERS.

1088
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:01,905
THROUGH DUNGEONS, FIRE AND 

1089
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,708
SWORD, AND HE HELD FAST TO HIS 

1090
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:05,775
FAITH IN AMERICA THROUGH SIX 

1091
00:49:05,775 --> 00:49:08,645
DECADES OF SERVICE.

1092
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:13,483
WE GATHER HERE TODAY TO HONOR AN

1093
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:14,651
AMERICAN PATRIOT WHO SERVED A 

1094
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,921
CAUSE GREATER THAN HIMSELF, AND 

1095
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:23,827
WE GATHER HERE REMEMBERING A MAN

1096
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:26,596
WHO KNEW HOW HE WANTED TO BE 

1097
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:27,798
REMEMBERED.

1098
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,568
SO LET ME SAY TO ALL THOSE

WE WILL EVER REMEMBER THAT JOHN

McCAIN SERVED HIS COUNTRY AND 

1103
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:51,421

1107
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:55,158
McCAIN.

1108
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,494
MAY GOD COMFORT HIS FAMILY AND

00:50:19,682 --> 00:50:22,752
SENDING THIS MESSAGE FROM THE

COUNTRY.

1122
00:50:26,522 --> 00:50:28,191
WE NOW EXPECT SENATOR MITCH 

1123

McCONNELL AND CHUCK SCHUMER TO 

1124
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,962
BOTH TOGETHER AND IN A SIGN OF 

1125
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,598
BIPARTISANSHIP -- THIS IS 

1126
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:35,232
SOMETHING THAT SENATOR McCAIN 

1127
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:36,333
WANTED.

1128
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,467
IT BREAKS PROTOCOL.

1129
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:40,036
HE WANTED THEM TO BOTH LAY THIS 

1130
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:40,703
WREATH TOGETHER AS A TESTAMENT 

1131
00:50:40,703 --> 00:50:41,972

DELIVER A WREATH FROM THE HOUSE.

1138
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,061
SENATOR McCAIN SERVED TWO TERMS 

1139
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:54,478
BEFORE HE ENTERED THE SENATE.

1140

I WANT TO BRING BACK IN OUR

JONATHAN KARL AND COKIE ROBERTS.

1148
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,600
AS I WAS WATCHING THIS, I WAS 

1149
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,268
THINKING, WE'RE ABOUT TO HEAD 

1150
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,336
INTO THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND.

1151
00:54:00,336 --> 00:54:02,572
FOR MANY AMERICANS, EVEN THOUGH 

1152
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,375
THERE WILL BE MORE CEREMONIES, 

1153
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,843
THIS WILL BE THE LAST MOMENT 

1154
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:08,311
THEY SAY.

1155
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,747
THEY SAW PEOPLE FROM BOTH SIDES 

1156
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,347
OF THE AISLE, DEMOCRATS AND 

1157
00:54:11,347 --> 00:54:12,015
REPUBLICANS COMING TOGETHER TO 

1158
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,750
LAY DOWN THAT WREATH, AND OF 

1159
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,384
COURSE, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE 

1160
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:15,451
PENCE AND NOT THE PRESIDENT TO 

1161
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:18,488
REPRESENT THE WHITE HOUSE.

1162
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:21,725
>> Reporter: AND I THINK, TOM, A

1163
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,027
MEMORIAL, A REMEMBRANCE THAT 

1164
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:24,661
JOHN McCAIN WOULD SAY, GREATER 

1165
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,695
THAN HIMSELF.

1166
00:54:26,695 --> 00:54:27,329
THIS WAS ABOUT SOMETHING LARGER 

1167
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:28,164
THAN JOHN McCAIN, AND I SAW 

1168
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,333
SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER SEEN 

1169
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:30,566
BEFORE.

1170
00:54:30,566 --> 00:54:33,937
I SAW MITCH McCONNELL CHOKING UP

1171
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,039
AS HE SPOKE ABOUT JOHN McCAIN, 

1172
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,074
SOMEBODY HE FOUGHT WITH 

1173
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:38,741
BITTERLY, ESPECIALLY ON CAMPAIGN

1174
00:54:38,741 --> 00:54:42,145
FINANCE REFORM, WHICH WAS THE 

1175
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:44,047
SIGNATURE ISSUE FOR JOHN McCAIN.

1176
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:46,583
McCONNELL WAS THE GUY ON THE 

1177
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,051
OTHER SIDE, AND TO SEE THE WAY 

1178
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:51,087
HE TOUCHED MITCH McCONNELL, YOU 

1179
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,388
KNOW, A HARDENED POLITICAL 

1180
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:53,056
FIGURE.

1181
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,825
I JUST WANT TO -- IT'S A CLOSING

1182
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:56,459
THOUGHT, TOM.

1183
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,327
READ YOU SOMETHING THAT McCAIN 

1184
00:54:58,327 --> 00:55:00,230
WROTE AT THE CLOSE OF HIS LAST 

1185
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:00,430
BOOK.

1186
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:04,400
HE SAID, I HAVE LIVED LIVES -- I

1187
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,336
HAVE LIVED VERY WELL.

1188
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:07,737
I HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF ALL 

1189
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:08,004
COMFORTS.

1190
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,338
I HAVE BEEN AS LONELY AS A 

1191
00:55:09,338 --> 00:55:10,573
PERSON CAN BE, AND I HAVE 

1192
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,710
ENJOYED THE COMPANY OF HEROES.

1193
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,178
I SUFFERED THE DEEPEST DESPAIR, 

1194
00:55:16,178 --> 00:55:20,650
AND EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST 

1195
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:20,950
EXULTATION.

1196
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,654
I WISH YOU ALL GOOD COMPANY, AND

1197
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,522
LIVES AS LUCKY AS MINE.

1198
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,290
>> AN INCREDIBLE STATEMENT.

1199
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,891
COKIE, I WAS STRUCK BY HOUSE 

1200
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:29,926
SPEAKER PAUL RYAN.

1201
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:32,562
HE SAID, WE GET STRONGER AT THE 

1202
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:33,596
BROKEN PLACES, TALKING ABOUT 

1203
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:35,698
SENATOR McCAIN, HIS TIME IN THAT

1204
00:55:35,698 --> 00:55:38,601
P.O.W. CAMP, BUT THEN HE ALSO 

1205
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,036
SAID, SENATOR McCAIN DIDN'T WIN 

1206
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,670
THE PRESIDENCY, BUT HE WILL BE 

1207
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,907
AN EXAMPLE OF FUTURE 

1208
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:45,675
GENERATIONS, TO FUTURE 

1209
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,008
GENERATIONS. 

1210
00:55:46,008 --> 00:55:47,544
>> THAT WAS ANOTHER BROKEN 

1211
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:50,246
PLACE, AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS

1212
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:51,647
A VERY ELOQUENT TESTIMONY, AND 

1213
00:55:51,647 --> 00:55:54,083
LOOKING AT THIS, SEEING JOHN 

1214
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:56,686
McCAIN'S 106-YEAR-OLD MOTHER 

1215
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,588
THROUGHOUT THIS, NOTHING IS 

1216
00:55:58,588 --> 00:55:59,856
HARDER THAN TO LOSE THE CHILD, 

1217
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:03,726
NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU ARE, AND 

1218
00:56:03,726 --> 00:56:04,727
HOW OLD HE WAS.

1219
00:56:04,727 --> 00:56:05,928
THIS MUST BE TERRIBLY PAINFUL, 

1220
00:56:05,928 --> 00:56:07,430
BUT ALSO THE INCREDIBLE 

1221
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,132
GATHERING THERE.

1222
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,099
NOT JUST OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 

1223
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:11,935
OF BOTH PARTIES AND PAST MEMBERS

1224
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:14,237

JUSTICES.

1229
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,777
AS I LOOKED AROUND THAT ROOM, 

1230
00:56:21,777 --> 00:56:30,487
ALL OF OFFICIALDOM OF THE LAST 

1231
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:31,187

1234
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:33,890
AND THE PUBLIC WILL COME.

1235
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,492
THAT'S THE MOST FITTING 

1236
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:35,759
TESTIMONY.

1237
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,494
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO HE 

1238
00:56:38,494 --> 00:56:39,161
SERVED FOR SO LONG AND SO NOBLY 

1239
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:40,696
WILL NOW HAVE THEIR CHANCE TO 

1240
00:56:40,696 --> 00:56:42,765
COME IN ONE BY ONE AND SAY 

1241
00:56:42,765 --> 00:56:44,367
GOOD-BYE TO JOHN McCAIN.

1242
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:48,204

WHEN WE STARTED THIS BROADCAST, 

1247
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,579
JOHN McCAIN NEVER BECAME A 

1248
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,014
PRESIDENT, BUT TODAY HE IS BEING

1249
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:02,051
TREATED LIKE HE SHOULD, LIKE HE 

1250
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:02,584
DESERVED A HEAD OF STATE.

1251
00:57:02,584 --> 00:57:03,186
WE'LL RETURN TO REGULAR
