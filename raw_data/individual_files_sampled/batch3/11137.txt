Italy is heading for a hung parliament after an election that failed to produce an outright winner Sunday's vote saw a surge for the euro skeptic five-star movement that was the party leader reacting to the exit poll results which gave five-star the largest number of votes Luigi DeMaio who is just 31 years old says he is now ready to find coalition partners to try and form a government a week's of deal-making lie ahead and several other parties will be seeking to form an alliance the anti-immigration League party is seeking to form a centre-right coalition it has teamed up with a former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from go Italy and the people of Freedom Party now Berlusconi himself is banned from holding office for another year over a fraud conviction League party leader Matteo salvini has already put his name forward to become Italy's next prime minister we are now under obligation to form a centre-right coalition we have a right and a duty to rule in the coming years one person who has already ruled himself out his former prime minister Matteo Renzi he quit as leader of the center-left Democratic Party after the worst election result in over a decade Renzi also added that the party would not enter into a coalition with either the five star movement or the league artis an Associate Rick and I was following the post-election reaction in Rome for us this was an election that was meant to bring stability and clarity to Italian politics but it seems to have done anything but that with of course the anti-establishment 5 star movement rocketing forward as well as the right-wing Leegin or taking quite many seats from the way things stand right now those parties of course are celebrating victories but in terms of the Italian moods we have to say there seems to be a lot of confusion in terms of where this is going to head forward because of course nobody has been able to grasp a majority to be able to lead the way and form a government so there's going to be lots of discussions and negotiations moving forward it seems now we have some of the biggest newspapers in Italy today with headlines such as this forward for the m5 star movement but the government is in a puzzle here a win for DeMaio but Italy is in governor bowl so these are just really celebrations inside party headquarters but where Italy goes from here is the big question we've been gauging some reactions on the streets here in Rome well if you do it sure let's trust the five star movement today young why not to such a disaster over the past few years the less policies didn't make anybody happy this defeat is mainly the result of the Democratic Party's politics basically it's a vote dictated by fear and despair the people's reaction was expected those will go to those who make promises and keep them we're in the same situation about five years ago we find ourselves in political confusion and it's brought about an uncertain result therefore we will face the same trouble again well we've seen some reactions for starters from France where a marine lepen had said that the European Union is not having a very relaxing night so to speak we've heard from former UK Pleader congratulating the five star movement all right the international media is calling the result a nightmare scenario for Brussels as well as a warning and a stinging rebuke and the league party is making some dire predictions for the eurozone since I've never changed my mind and keep on saying choosing the euro was a mistake it's clear to us that the system of having one common currency is going to end not because salvini wants it to be the case but because it's a matter of common sense the real economy shows it so we want to be prepared for that moment on associate sure can I asked an Italian political analyst about the possibility of a rift with the EU do you think Brussels is worried yes is really worried because you know first of all facts are moments nor the even their right-wing coalition they are not so happy about the eurozone about European Union and several times particularly salvinia say that he wants to abolish the sanction against Russia I want to change even the foreign policies of Italy he wants to restart again cooperation with with Russia and for sure herbicide is not happy about this is really concerned button totally boots that I can say even the United States developed some media even strat for the intelligence agency they published some analysis some videos about Italy and they are really concerned about this and I believe that in the future we Italy can really change the joke with the balances in Europe buying the international arena
