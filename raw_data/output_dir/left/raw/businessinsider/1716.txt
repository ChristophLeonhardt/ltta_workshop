00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
there's also been a lot of attention

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,259
this week on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the price of the EpiPen the</font>

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,210
epinephrine injector<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people use to</font>

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,300
prevent allergic reactions the price has

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">just drastically increased over the last</font>

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,780
few years putting a lot of pressure on

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,370
health insurance<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs and also</font>

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">individuals who have to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for their</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">own epic ends what's what can be done to</font>

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,859
fix this sort of problem where is the

11
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,510
where's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy failure well you know</font>

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,350
most almost everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the US has</font>

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">some sort of system where</font>

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,800
pharmaceuticals are not in fact soul you

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,390
know on an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> market there either</font>

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,340
controlled or their purchased by a

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,170
national health agency or something like

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,050
that and the result often is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the US</font>

19
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,090
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the residual where the monopoly</font>

20
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,280
profits are earned so ya might want to

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,390
look almost by definition drugs are our

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,610
monopoly enterprises because of patent

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,360
system so regulate them like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Napoles</font>

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,039
but the weird thing is epinephrine is is

25
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,559
not under patent the the device is under

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,629
patent but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hard to invent</font>

27
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,670
an equivalent device in fact there is

28
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one on the market and said I've</font>

29
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,299
seen a lot of pushback from

30
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,100
conservatives on this basically saying

31
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,479
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know set aside the issue of drug</font>

32
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,640
patents here the issue is that the FDA

33
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,619
has been has made it too difficult to

34
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,270
approve competing devices and you could

35
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,130
have a competitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> market in this</font>

36
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,630
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> price controls if you had</font>

37
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,850
several companies allowed to sell you

38
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,400
know we have I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we can talk about</font>

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,140
details of FDA policy and whether

40
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,140
they're too too slow but you know there

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,060
have been reasons the FDA rules are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

42
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,189
there arbitrarily they it happened

43
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there were disasters there were</font>

44
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,040
drugs that turned out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be extremely</font>

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">harmful so the point is a simple</font>

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,970
ideology free markets it's not going to

47
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,860
do it saying your markets are bad is not

48
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it either but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

49
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,149
step in and say weird where do we need a

50
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,590
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more hand to protect people</font>

51
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">and by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I have close relative</font>

52
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,750
with a lethal peanut allergy so I the

53
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,180
EpiPen is a real issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen I've</font>

54
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,649
seen it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> action I can see what the</font>

financial hardship would be
