joining me now the chair russia's Foreign Affairs Committee constant koskoff this cost awful Oh welcome to the program so if Trump does go ahead with this if the u.s. drops out of this treaty what's it gonna mean for russian-american relations as you see it well if the United States drops the agreement and then proceeds with deploying its medium-range missiles let's say in Poland or in the Baltic States that will definitely mean completely new military threat towards Russia because these missiles will be will have a capacity of reaching Russian areas for beyond the Ural Mountains and that's definitely a substantial threat towards Russian national security and secondly it will undermine the capacity of Russia to to strike back in case nuclear nuclear conflict starts so it will undermine the grounds of stability in terms of nuclear weapons in more general terms and definitely Russia will have to respond and as mr. Putin already one year ago mentioned the Russian response will be immediate it will be very quick and we do have capacities to do that but all that would put into a completely new zone of highest possible risks the whole area of Europe so the European countries are hostages of this situation and I hope they will be able to express their opinion on that we see how Germany starts to react we see how France starts to react but unfortunately we see other countries like the United Kingdom who are still going in the tracks of the United States of America supporting them all their explosive steps in me sir could it be that mr. Trump's trying to use his leverage here as he sees it to come with some sort of better deal for the United States well everything is possible but I am less optimistic in comparison with many of my colleagues here in Moscow I do believe that the decision has been already taken I do believe that the United States of America is not any longer interested in keeping the INF treaty alive the same way Americans were not interested in keeping alive the ABM Treaty fifteen years earlier they do not need any longer any agreements in the field of strategic armaments and intermedium missiles and all that stuff because that would create equal opportunities equal circumstances for each part involved in a certain agreement and this is what they would not like to accept any longer they are they are seeking the unilateral military advantage they want to be the only power in the world who takes decisions what is good and what is bad who is guilty and who is innocent to judge and to punish other countries and for that they do not need this type of agreements unfortunately what does Russia want to see here at the end of the day I mean that agreement was drawn up thirty years ago China wasn't so very much on the scene then as a worry could this could some better agreement come out of all this maybe with this meeting today well everything is possible and nothing is perfect in the world and this agreement I believe should be amended and I would recall that mr. Putin as the president of Russia as early as in 2007 11 years ago came up with an official proposal to modernize this treaty making it Universal by including in this treaty other countries who possess inter medium-range missiles and it's not just China it's other nuclear powers it's Israel Pakistan India so many other countries yes this proposal is still on the board but for that you don't need to ruin to undermine the existing treaty you should propose amendments you should start talks with other countries which would be eventual participants in the future agreement but to delete something in order to create probably to create anything which would be better for me is an absolutely unacceptable way of logic final quick 30 seconds sir I wonder if any of this the timing of it as far as Trump's concerns are going to do with those upcoming midterms do you think maybe for domestic consumption and popularity or not I definitely believe that this is the case mr. Trump is somehow trapped by accusations of him being in some kind of communications or cooperation with Russia and being hostile towards Russia would always give him additional points in terms of the ongoing election campaign I hope that something may change as long as soon as this campaign is over this is the only thing I may hope you know you're busy man as always thank you for taking the time off to talk to us you're not international give us your thoughts chair of Russia's for Affairs Committee constant cough thanks Ben live with us you
