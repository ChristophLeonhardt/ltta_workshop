and snowmobiles Woodman all sorts of military but every year they are trying making it really special and these vehicles is why this year's military Day Parade is nothing like any other before these armored personnel carriers are being shown for the first time and we are going to ride one of them practice makes perfect they say and seemingly simple maneuvers like this one stop being all that simple when there are dozens of vehicles involved and they all have to be in sync that's why Moscow's main streets have been blocked off for these beasts to refine their maneuvers this APC is designed to absorb explosive damage from land mines and its hull will deflect even armor-piercing rounds now it's not the only vehicle to be making the first show at this year's parade so let me give you a tour these unmanned drones will be shown to the public officially for the first time at the parade there were initially being designed as a purely reconnaissance aircraft but now they can carry bombs too ballistic missiles have become an essential part of any Victory Day Parade in Moscow and this one is no exception and finally how about this terminators one the Red Square no this is not a plot of a Hollywood blockbuster but rather this tank Support Unit it will also be for the first time featured at a parade on the red square so now this is of course is just a mere taste of what to expect at the actual parade so do tune in on the 9th of May and have a look yourself what these guys have prepared for you
