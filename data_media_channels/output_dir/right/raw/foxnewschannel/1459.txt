00:00:07,946 --> 00:00:11,583
>> Tucker: THE GENIUSES IN THE

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:15,354
DIVISION IN THE DNC SUGGEST THEY

3
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:17,356
CAN RIDE THE RUSSIA SCANDAL TO

4
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:17,856
THE POLLS.

5
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:19,491
THEY'RE GOING AFTER THE

6
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:20,159
ADMINISTRATION'S ECONOMIC

7
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:20,492
RECORD.

8
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:21,694
UNEMPLOYMENT IS PRETTY LOW.

9
00:00:21,694 --> 00:00:22,594
STOCK MARKET IS PRETTY HIGH.

10
00:00:22,594 --> 00:00:25,030
INSTEAD, THE ATTACK IS ON GAS

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,131
PRICES WHICH ARE GOING UP, AND

12
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:28,767
THAT IS BAD FOR THE

13
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:29,501
MIDDLE-CLASS, SOMETHING TO BE

14
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:30,202
WORRIED ABOUT.

15
00:00:30,202 --> 00:00:31,904
THE PROBLEM, OF COURSE, IS THE

16
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:33,338
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS SPENT YEARS

17
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:36,875
VOWING TO INCREASE GAS PRICES IF

18
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:37,776
ELECTED IN THE NAME OF STOPPING

19
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:39,445
GLOBAL WARMING.

20
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,847
2016 PLATFORM LITERALLY DEMANDED

21
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:43,782
A HIGHER TAX.

22
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:44,783
MARC STEIN IS AN AUTHOR AND

23
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:45,150
COLUMNIST.

24
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,019
HE WAS ALIVE IN 2016 PAYING

25
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,220
ATTENTION.

26
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,088
HE MAY REMEMBER THAT PLANK IN

27
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:49,888
THE PLATFORM.

28
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:52,791
WHAT'S HE MAKE OF IT NOW?

29
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:53,158
HEY, MARC!

30
00:00:53,158 --> 00:00:53,692
>> HI, TUCKER.

31
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:58,964
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF A PORT IN

32
00:00:58,964 --> 00:00:59,898
THE STORM.

33
00:00:59,898 --> 00:01:02,701
THE BLUE WAVE IS PETERING OUT AS

34
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,602
IT COMES TOWARD SHORE.

35
00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:05,804
YOU SAID THE RUSSIA HOAX.

36
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:08,340
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO THINK IN THE

37
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,176
WORLD RIGHT NOW IF ALL OF THE

38
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:12,711
PEOPLE WHO TOLD US THAT TRUMP

39
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:17,616
HAD NO CHANCE TO WIN IN 2016, IF

40
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:18,350
SOMEHOW THE BLUE WAVE DOESN'T

41
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,685
HAPPEN AND THE REPUBLICANS WIN

42
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:21,820
THE MIDTERMS, THERE'S A HUGE

43
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,590
OPPORTUNITY FOR A SINISTER

44
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,657
FOREIGN POWER OUT THERE THAT

45
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:28,026
THEY COULD GET THE DEMOCRATS TO

46
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:30,095
BLAME THEM FOR STEALING THE

47
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:32,731
ELECTION SO WE CAN HAVE A

48
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:35,267
SLOVENIA INVESTIGATION OR A

49
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:38,537
TAJIKISTAN INVESTIGATION OR A

50
00:01:38,537 --> 00:01:39,271
SOLOMON ISLANDS INVESTIGATION.

51
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:41,106
IF YOU'RE THE SOLOMON ISLANDS

52
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:41,840
AMBASSADOR, NOW WOULD BE A

53
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,243
REALLY GOOD TIME TO BOOK A LUNCH

54
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:45,811
WITH SAY MITCH MCCONNELL SO

55
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:46,812
IT'LL LOOK SUSPICIOUS ON THE

56
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:48,947
WEDNESDAY MORNING AFTER IN

57
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:49,314
NOVEMBER.

58
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:50,983
AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANY

59
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:53,452
IDEAS TO THE DNC OR THE F.B.I.,

60
00:01:53,452 --> 00:01:55,754
BUT IF THE F.B.I. HAS ANY SPARE

61
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:56,789
CAMBRIDGE PROFESSORS LYING

62
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,158
AROUND THAT IT WOULD LIKE TO,

63
00:01:59,158 --> 00:02:02,494
YOU KNOW, SAY TO MINOR TRUMP

64
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:05,297
OFFICIALS, YOU KNOW, MAYBE A

65
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:08,800
STAFFER TO MITCH MCCOM, OH, YOU

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,203
KNOW -- MITCH MCCONNELL, OH, YOU

67
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:14,473
KNOW SLOVENIA HAS THE DNC

68
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:14,807
E-MAILS.

69
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:16,408
THIS IS THE TIME TO MOVE ONTO

70
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:17,776
THE NEXT PLOT NOW THAT RUSSIA

71
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:18,410
HASN'T WORKED OUT.

72
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,645
>> Tucker: YOU'RE LAUGHING

73
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:23,248
ABOUT THIS THE NEXT INDEPENDENT

74
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:24,082
COUNSEL OR FOUR INDEPENDENT

75
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:25,384
COUNSELS FOR NOW WILL PULL THIS

76
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:27,452
TAPE AND USING IT AS EVIDENCE IN

77
00:02:27,452 --> 00:02:28,053
YOUR TRIAL?

78
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:28,520
>> NO.

79
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,021
THAT'S RIGHT.

80
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:30,656
WHAT DID I KNOW AND WHEN DID I

81
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:31,557
KNOW IT?

82
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:34,293
BUT I MEAN, I MEAN, ONE OTHER

83
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:35,727
THING -- I MEAN, JUST TO BE

84
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:36,728
SERIOUS HERE FOR A MOMENT,

85
00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:37,863
BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY TAKE THIS

86
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:40,365
THING THAT SERIOUSLY.

87
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:43,735
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY

88
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:45,537
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A LACK OF

89
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:48,674
MESSAGE, AND TO PROFESS NOW TO

90
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:50,776
BE CONCERNED ABOUT GAS PRICES

91
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:56,081
AFTER THEY'VE DERIDED THE TRUMP

92
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:57,482
TAX CUTTER'S CRUMBS AND ALL THE

93
00:02:57,482 --> 00:03:00,686
REST OF IT, I MEAN ACTUALLY THE

94
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:04,022
SOLUTION IS NOT TO REPLACE THE

95
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:06,258
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION WITH GAS

96
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:06,592
PRICES.

97
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:08,627
THE SOLUTION IS TO FIGURE OUT

98
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:09,628
THAT TRUMP CONNECTED WITH

99
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:12,898
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

100
00:03:12,898 --> 00:03:14,166
WHO PITCHED ON THE TV AND FOUND

101
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,703
NEAR THE REPUBLICAN NOR DEMOCRAT

102
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:19,304
ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE LEAST BIT

103
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:20,005
CONCERNED ABOUT THEM.

104
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:30,449
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

105
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:32,885
>> Tucker: I GOT TO ASK YOU

106
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:33,518
ABOUT HARVEY WEINSTEIN?

107
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:34,453
BECAUSE I CAN'T CONTROL MYSELF.

108
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:42,945
OBVIOUSLY --

109
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:48,066
DO YOU WANT TO PUT

110
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,068
A BOW ON THIS STORY?

111
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:52,004
WHAT SHOULD WE THINK OF THIS?

112
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:52,938
>> YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE

113
00:03:52,938 --> 00:03:53,472
HILLARY CONNECTION.

114
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,008
THEY ACTUALLY HAD LUNCH TO

115
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:58,744
DISCUSS AFTER HER DEFEAT HARVEY

116
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:01,580
WEINSTEIN MAKING THE DOCUMENTARY

117
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,848
ABOUT HILLARY'S DEFEAT.

118
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:03,715
THAT'S HOW TIED IN THEY ARE.

119
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:05,550
I THINK THIS IS -- I THINK THIS

120
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,052
IS QUITE IMPORTANT, THOUGH,

121
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:10,222
BECAUSE THE ME TOO MOVEMENT,

122
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:11,223
THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF MORAL

123
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:12,157
PANIC TO IT THERE'S NO DOUBT

124
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:12,724
ABOUT THIS GUY.

125
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:15,961
HE'S INCREDIBLY ACCUSED OF RAPE

126
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:18,130
BY ACTRESSES IN THE UNITED

127
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,332
STATES, CANADA, THE UNITED

128
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:21,033
KINGDOM, FRANCE, NEW ZEALAND,

129
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:23,869
ALL OVER THE PLANET, AND THIS

130
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:26,104
TELLS US SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY

131
00:04:26,104 --> 00:04:29,641
WEALTHY AND POWERFUL MEN USE

132
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:31,576
THINGS LIKE CONFIDENTIALITY

133
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:32,544
AGREEMENTS TO SILENCE PEOPLE AND

134
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:35,347
GET AWAY WITH THEIR CRIMES FOR

135
00:04:35,347 --> 00:04:36,281
DECADES ON END.

136
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:38,183
THAT'S THE LESSON HERE.

137
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:39,985
DON'T LIVE IN SILENCE.

138
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:42,621
DON'T LIVE IN FEAR.

139
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:44,156
AND FRANKLY THINGS LIKE

140
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:44,823
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS I

141
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:49,361
THINK SHOULD HAVE A FAR MORE

142
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:50,095
CIRCUMSCRIBEED PLACE IN AMERICAN

143
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:50,395
LIFE.

144
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:51,163
>> Tucker: THERE'S ALSO -- I

145
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:52,164
AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU

146
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:53,598
SAID, BUT THERE'S ALSO A

147
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:55,367
SUBLESSON HERE WHICH IS IF

148
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:56,601
YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT PEOPLE ARE

149
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:59,438
UP TO, LOOK AT THE BEHAVIOR THAT

150
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:00,372
THEY DENOUNCE IN PUBLIC.

151
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:01,373
IT'S PROBABLY THE VERY SAME

152
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:02,607
THING.

153
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:04,042
HARVEY WEINSTEIN WAS THIS GREAT

154
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:06,645
CHAMPION OF WOMEN AS WAS

155
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:07,245
SCHNEIDERMAN.

156
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:09,448
THE ONE THING I'M NOT IN FAVOR

157
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:11,016
OF IS HURTING WOMEN.

158
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:13,085
THEY WERE DOING THE EXACT SAME

159
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:13,385
THING.

160
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:14,886
I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN

161
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:15,253
ACCIDENT.

162
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:16,355
>> I THINK THAT'S A LIBERAL

163
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:17,856
THING, BY THE WAY.

164
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:18,824
YOU PROFESS TO CARE ABOUT PEOPLE

165
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:19,925
IN GENERAL, SO YOU CARE ABOUT

166
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:23,428
THIRD WORLD PEOPLE IN GENERAL OR

167
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:25,030
GAYS IN GENERAL OR MUSLIMS IN

168
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,666
GENERAL AND YOU TAKE THAT AS A

169
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,602
LICENSE TO TRASH AND ABUSE

170
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:33,672
AND THAT'S WHAT TIES HARVEY

171
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:35,273
WEINSTEIN, SCHNEIDERMAN AND A

172
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:38,744
LOT OF THESE MOSTLY DEMOCRAT,

173
00:05:38,744 --> 00:05:41,646
MOSTLY LIBERAL FIGURES TOGETHER.

174
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:43,015
THEY SAID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS

175
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:44,383
IN PUBLIC AND THEN THEY'VE GOT

176
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:47,719
THE, YOU KNOW, THE DOOR LOCK

177
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:50,322
BUTTON UNDER THE DESK IN PRIVATE

178
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:55,694
AND THEY'VE GOT THE STANDARD

179
00:05:55,694 --> 00:05:57,929
NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT STACKED

180
00:05:57,929 --> 00:06:04,569
IN TRIPLICATE UNDER THE DESK.

181
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,205
THEY LOVE HUMANITY IN GENERAL

182
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:08,673
AND ABUSE HUMANS IN PARTICULAR.

183
00:06:08,673 --> 00:06:10,542
>> Tucker: IF READING AND

184
00:06:10,542 --> 00:00:00,000
WRITING STILL EXISTS ONCE THIS
