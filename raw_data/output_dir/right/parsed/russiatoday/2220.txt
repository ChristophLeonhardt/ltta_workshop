and I think we will disturb people a
little bit I hope they will enjoy the
show of course because it's it's a very
dark humor and you can enjoy it but of
course it's a state of the world and we
try to tell how it is and how broken
everything is and how how small
understanding between the people is in
the world and I think our plate or our
own musical could help to see everyone
as you man and initial start to listen
and to understand the perspective of the
other one and if a little bit of this
happens in this evening we did a great
job I think or so that's how we do it
you
you
