the massive tax cuts for the wealthy never played well with the American people even before they were passed polling indicated that more Americans actually opposed these tax cuts than wanted them accepted them approved of them and so now we have certain members of the GOP running for election re-election who just don't want to talk about the tax cuts because it's not playing so well with their constituents and a prime example of that is representative Peter Roskam from Illinois now he is the architect of the tax cuts that were recently passed by Republicans which of course went into effect this year but he is not mentioning it at all in any of his ads Roskam is yet to air a single ad touting the law he helped craft his challenger though businessman Shawn Caston is now on the air slamming him for the legislation and we have an example of that so let's take a look at the video I'm showing cast and I approve this message there's no disputing Peter Roskam link to Donald Trump as the author of Trump's tax plan that gave one trillion in tax breaks to big corporations and the top one percent adding nearly two trillion to the deficit and to pay for all this they want to send the bill to America's seniors cutting Social Security and Medicare tax breaks for corporate special interests Illinois families get stuck with a bill Roskam and Trump together 94% of the time hurting Illinois families that ad is 100% accurate it is it is and the district that that that they're having this race in is a fascinating district we'll get to the details of that in just a second but what was ross cams response to these attack ads I love it my opponent has really embraced the politics of ridicule he's fallen into this trap of Republican name-calling I love that he's toast so he Roskam the Republican is doing what weak sauce Democrats normally do oh I'm not with them I'm not with him he's calling it Republican name-calling even though he's a Republican right now at all and he's complaining about being bullied this is a classic way that Democrats lose so Roskam thank you very much we appreciate your weakness and what you're doing is reinforcing casas framing which is the number one mistake that Democrats normally make and he's making it wonderful my favorite part is when he called Caston too aggressive OSU calling out what you're actually doing exactly exactly you are the architect of this tax plan and it's been a disaster for the very people that you're supposed to be representing so that's the interesting thing so this district is predominantly white and also upper-middle class most people make at least six figures and it used to be dominated by Republicans just to give you an example MIT Romney won this district by an eight point margin in 2012 but Trump lost it by seven in 2016 and part of the reason why they lost it he lost it Trump did is because the people in the area are actually socially liberal but they're also fiscally conservative they're legitimately fiscally conservative so they don't like these tax cuts and let's keep it real Illinois does have a higher state tax and the people living in this district are worried that this is actually going to increase their taxes because the new tax plan caps the amount that you can deduct in state taxes no no Roscoe's toast I mean it's gone normally this is the kind of thing that the Democrats would bungle and it would drive me crazy cuz it's a layup I mean if Hillary wanna buy seven points there's no reason why Democrats should lose it in 2018 but even more so that phenomenon that Ana just talked about well they're normally fiscally conservative that it might like the tax cuts and they might think I'd rather have the money and I don't care if the Republicans are terrible people to other human beings right it'll outweigh but not anymore for two reasons one is this particular tax cut actually raises taxes in Illinois New York New Jersey in California so they wanted to punish the blue states oops okay so those fiscally conservative guy who goes wait wait I just got robbed my taxes went up and you hate gay and blacks and all these things that I don't agree with right and so that's the second phenomenon they're highly educated in that district visa vie the rest of the country so it makes them very uncomfortable like before when it was dog whistles if you give them enough tax cuts they could get past the dog whistles now when it's a bullhorn saying we hate Muslims and Latinos and we got massive issues with blacks and and and gays etc there you go man I it's turning my stomach I can't vote for these monsters and who raise my taxes I'll see you wouldn't want to be you and that's why now Roskam is crying and crying about outcasts and it's too aggressive like what you see click this subscribe button below and don't forget to ring the bell to never miss another video from the Young Turks
