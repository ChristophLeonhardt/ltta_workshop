banner week for winning on every single front and you've got a balance at all I know some cultural conservatives were worried there's still a little bit worried about judge Cavanaugh is judge Cavanaugh sufficiently originalist sufficiently pro-life meaning that he'll interpret the Constitution as it actually is written which does not have a right to abortion is he sufficiently rock-ribbed I don't you know that these are some worries I will I think lay out the case that on every single front this week we are winning even on judge Cavanaugh to begin the the greatest video the greatest moment in this presidency all week I know there every week there seems to be a new one but this is so beautiful Donald Trump talking to a bunch of freeloading Europeans as well as the German nation the worst nation in the history of the world which is destroyed civilization on multiple occasions here is Donald Trump talking to our NATO or freeloading NATO allies but Germany is totally controlled by Russia because they were getting from 60 to 70 percent of their energy from Russia and a new pipeline and you tell me if that's appropriate because I think it's not and I think it's a very bad thing for NATO and I don't think it should have happened and I think we have to talk to Germany better the top of that Germany is just paying a little bit over 1% whereas the United States in actual numbers has paid 4.2 percent of a much larger GDP so I think that's inappropriate also you know we're protecting Germany were protecting France were protecting everybody and yet we're paying a lot of money to protect now this has been going on for decades this has been brought up by other presidents but other presidents never did anything about it because I don't think they understood it or they just didn't want to get involved but I have to bring it up because I think it's very unfair to our country it's very unfair to our taxpayers and I think that these countries have to step it up not over a 10-year period have to step it up immediately Germany is a rich country they talk about thinking hey Greece it is tiny bit by 2030 well they could increase it immediately tomorrow and have no problem I don't think it's fair to the United States so we're gonna have to do something because we're not gonna put up with it we can't put up with it and it's inappropriate oh we got to get another batch just for those like Bavarian tears or those Prussian cheer tears rizona hmm very good only Donald Trump could do this only president Trump could do this and you know I'm a little harsh on Germany I'm probably a you know one and a half percent kidding I'm ninety eight and a half percent serious but you know a little bit tongue-in-cheek but he's so right on this point only president Trump could do this every other president goes up he say you know NATO's they're supposed to be paying more just 2% of GDP there's they're not even doing that though we're paying 4% of GDP you know maybe maybe they should could because we're protecting them and they're undercutting us at every turn and and then also they're importing oil from Russia so they're buying oil from Russia we are paying to protect Europe from Russia Russia Europe is using all of that money to pay Russia this doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense for past presidents can't do that because they don't want to rock the boat this is an emperor has no clothes a situation this is a situation where all of the presidents come in and they say well this is NATO NATO been around for decades and decades and decades and you know that's just the way it works and they don't pay they're not fulfilling their commitments but you know well we should pay it this is how it's always been oh they're giving out money to rush it well you know that's not good but that's how it's always we can't change can't touch NATO weaken NATO's been by the way the Cold War has been over for what thirty years now but oh no we can't touch NATO this relic of the Cold War no no no we can't do that and President Trump comes in he looks at it he says hold on I'm sorry maybe I'm maybe I'm a little thick maybe I'm a little stupid because I haven't been in Washington for my entire life but the way it looks to me is that we're paying more money than we're supposed to be paying to you and you're not paying the amount of money you're supposed to be paying and then you're giving all that money to the people we're supposed to be protecting you from tell me how that makes sense and all of the smart people although the educated people all of the expert people they say oh well I can't what what a stupid question why would he ask that question all pop up and then he said well what's the answer said well because that's the way it is well the way it is isn't gonna work is it President Trump is so it's so lovely it's so refreshing to have somebody who's from outside the political process who's from outside Washington was from outside the decades and decades and decades of minor little changes small little things adding up to this big nonsensical situation he comes in and he says doesn't make any sense I got some fresh set of eyes it doesn't make any sense a beautiful thing the left says Donald Trump is treating our allies like our our enemies and our enemies like our allies that's not true at all President Trump is just looking and he's saying you know it's not a friendship if you're being taken advantage of if one friend is taking advantage of another so-called friend that isn't a friendship right you got a you got to be on even footing and you can't play you know play soft with these people forever World War two ended 70 years ago there you know that this we don't need to keep walking around the situation so President Trump comes in I think it's a beautiful thing it's not like by the way they're trying to pretend that President Trump is being really nice to Russia the the example he's using here is that Europe should stop buying oil from Russia that's actually what what the ask is isn't it saying stop buying oil from Russia start buying oil from not start spending money on NATO's spending money in your own defense and this is possible by the way Poland doesn't buy oil from Russia do they there are plenty of places you know it's certainly possible not to buy it well from Russia she's saying this situation doesn't make sense that's a beautiful thing and the arguments against it don't make a whole lot of sense either so on foreign affairs we really are winning just look around the world Isis is defeated militarily North Korea has come to the table now who knows it looks like they're backing out of that pretend deal okay nothing nothing really ventured nothing really gained but that's fine we still have the bigger button that actually works and and is offers a credible threat of violence in North Korea the Middle East is doing far better we finally come back to our ally Israel whom Barack Obama gave the one-finger salute to for eight years and we've we've fulfilled an American promise that's going on for decades to move the embassy to Jerusalem that's pretty good we're allowing Russia to help us in the Middle East in so much as they can help us but without any illusions that were somehow allies now and we have the identical strategic interests we don't were finally confronting China China's been stealing our IP for years making aggressive military action in the South China Sea presidents have been whining about it but they haven't done anything president Trump is finally forcing them to the table to negotiate on trade these are huge wins on foreign policy foreign policy I don't know could be going really any better than it is right now how about on domestic policy the the federal bureaucracy has been growing and sprawling and undercutting the the democratic process for years and years and years and this is not some new Trump talking point conservatives have been talking about this for years Antonin Scalia said before he died that the administrative state is the greatest threat to Liberty in the United States so are we taking them on here we go we've got a Republican trey Gowdy taking on a bureaucrat extraordinaire trying to undercut a democratic election in 2016 Peter struck here is the committee hearing you got another text from your colleague Lisa Paige Trump's not ever going to become president right right and you replied no no he's not we'll stop it by the time you promise to stop him from becoming president on August the 8th how many interviews had you conducted mr. gowdey so two answers that with regard to how many interviews had or had not been conducted I've been directed by counsel for the FBI not to answer that question second sir I think it's important to take those texts in the context of how they were written and what they meant and there and someone may ask you that question agent strong but I didn't I asked you how many people you interviewed before you wrote it if you want to get into context let one of my other colleagues do that with you here's what I want to know who's the he and he's not he is then candidate Trump so when you said no Donald Trump's not in connection with a question going to become president what's the it chairman stop it chairman Gowdy that text needs to be taken in the cut I'm asking look if you want to have a debate over a two letter word we're gonna have to do that some all the time what and who did you mean by it mr. Gowdy as I've stated that text was written late at night in shorthand I don't care when it was read I don't care whether it was longhand cursive I don't care about any of that I want to know what it meant agent struck it would be his candidacy for the presence that the omit the important thing here is not that we get answers from struck we're not going to get answers from struck he's gonna say I need to talk to counsel I need to talk to that I don't know I'm not you know but at least we're exposing them this is a this is something that we're finally able to do because of Technology and because of the new political climate you know the left was trying to use the mainstream media of the federal bureaucracy whatever any tool at their disposal to overturn a presidential election will explain how in just one second I got to talk about movement you know how I know that we have to do that because I'm wearing my movement watch I love movement I wear this watch every day you've heard me talk about movement many times those two college dropouts that started their own watch company this company has grown like crazy even just in the time that we've been talking about them on the show they now have sold almost two million watches in 160 plus countries they continue to revel I revolutionize fashion on the belief that style shouldn't break the bank occasionally they'll send me a freebie and I'm really hoping they send me more freebies because they have even cooler watches out now they're unrolling a few new collections this one came out a little while ago the revolver collection I can't tell you how many compliments I get on this watch it's really cool because it's both sleek and modern but it's got this real retro look it's not you know it's not too busy it's not got a million things going on it's just a really slick looking watch it's it's come a long way from being crowdfunded out of a living room they also now have expanded the sunglasses fashion-forward bracelets for her or him you know it's 2018 man that's cool get with the program get with your preferred pronoun movement watches are all about looking good and keeping it simple I really everywhere I go is up and say in a barber over the weekend people were complimenting me on this watch and it's across the spectrum of people so like sort of traditional you know tie blazers are wearing conservatives complement it and also on rare occasion when I'm hanging out with like cool guys in LA who have like spiky hair and man buns and whatever they have a complement it to it just is really broadly appreciated movement watches by the way start at just 95 bucks at a department store you would pay three four hundred maybe five hundred bucks for a watch of this quality but movement cuts out the middleman they sell direct online so you don't have that retail markup and that retail market by the way can be 5 X 4 X I mean really high classic design quality construction and style to minimalism get 15% off today with free shipping and free returns don't say I never did nothing for you celebrate this banner week for American liberty go to movement calm slash cough f8m VMT dot-com slash cough FAC o VF e fe you only put the vowels in this after the slash before that it's only consonants then you get vowels after the /cy movement keeps growing check out their expanding collection MV m t.com slash co f fa co v fe fe and join the movement seriously it's so so nice back to how the left is subverting a presidential election they did this to Richard Nixon the impeachment of Richard Nixon Nixon won in a landslide they used every tool at their disposal the press and the bureaucracy the deep state to overturn that election they've been trying to do it again so what they do is they have this of a scandal this is the Russia collusion it's just a facade of a scandal explain to me how Trump colluded with Russia just go I'll give you just have a minute just explain to yourself think for a second how did Trump collude with Russia we've been talking about this for two years now what do I know how did Trump collude with Russia you probably can't explain how right because there's no evidence it's just the facade of a scandal and what this does what these hearings do when you get Peter struck one of the FBI agents investigating this who clearly had an anti-trump bias who was saying I'm gonna use the power of the state to stop Trump from becoming president when you bring them up there you cut through that facade and you expose the American people to directly what what the so-called scandal is they see it clearly this is the great change in 2016 2017 you've got a president who is skipping the mainstream media talking directly to the American people largely via Twitter you've got it you can cut through that with congressional testimony you can cut through that with live-streaming you can get through that with tweeting and cut that you can just cut through the facade and see see it for what it really is this is all about optics and the optics look really bad for Peter struck here because he goes on and you can watch the testimony I wish we had the clip of him stammering like an idiot but he looks arrogant he looks guilty he looks like he's hiding something he obviously is hiding things because he won't answer very direct questions that are not that there is no reason that he shouldn't answer them other than he's gonna make himself look like more of a dirtbag than he already does so you get to see that directly this is a beautiful thing it's the same thing by the way with the stormy Daniels arrest you might have seen that stormy Daniels was arrested in a strip club in Ohio for violating state law that's fine she's you know she's a stripper it wouldn't be the first time you know somebody who works primarily in Vice gets arrested or something like that but what is it about it's all about the optics do I really blame stormy Daniels for the crime of rubbing up on gentlemen at a strip club no that's sort of that's what she does right that's her job but we get to see it now we actually see what's happening you know what the left ones to paint is that stormy Daniels is this heroic feminist victim of Donald Trump's a recive 'no snow she's a she's a professional stripper who gets paid to have sex on camera that's what she is now that doesn't mean you know that she can't be victimized but she isn't victimized here that's for sure and you're just seeing if you were just to watch the mainstream media sail stormy Daniels this heroine Joan of Arc you know but then you say no she gets arrested for rubbing her her her body all over men in a strip club that's her real that's the reality of her life she's still working to get paid EV sex on camera she's still working as a stripper off-camera perhaps she's still she's still doing that that's the reality of it she's being she's being paid to degrade herself and when you look at what this all of these scandals are it does seem like they're people who are getting paid to degrade themselves you know Michael avenatti is the real prostitute in the situation because he's glommed on to these fake scandals and these facades of scandals to get himself on CNN 27 hours a day I mean they're even even the left is finally knocking him for it they're saying Michael avenatti is taking down Trump one CNN hit at a time okay you know this guy really seems to like the camera it was dangerous place in the countries between Michael avenatti and a TV camera but you're finally seeing that's that's a very important thing because the the more that we can show the American people the reality of this the less likely they are to buy the left's ridiculous narrative if they if all the American people are exposed to is the narrative they might be duped by it but luckily the reality is on our side so all we have to do is just shine a light and expose it you saw yesterday I played that clip of CNN CNN was talking to an illegal alien woman you know said her child was gone who separated from her and they asked her how the kids doing and the woman said D said que esta muy bien he says he's doing very well and CNN translated it and said oh it's everything's terrible and Trump's a monster and they're crying and it's awful and but when you've seen the reality the realities on our side when you see the fake narrative then people get confused how bet on the economy so that's just on the on the bureaucracy part of it on the economy the economy is doing so so well people ask me they say you know the the lefties will try to say well it's really secretly the economy's doing very poorly but even though it seems like it's doing great the economy has base I've never been better unemployment is at an 18-year low there is a labor shortage right now that's good for two reasons one there are more jobs to fill than people to fill them and - it means wages are going to go up wages have stagnated for a long time at this point over over a decade largely they've stagnated in the middle class and now wages are going up because there's a labor shortage that's wonderful a jobless claims were at a forty four year low just about all excellent news on the economy this also ties into the immigration issue because when you flood the country with immigrants and illegal aliens we just tend to go down especially in certain sectors they can they can really destroy the labor market so in that respect Donald Trump is winning both on the main issue of his presidency and on the economy which is what people care about cuz they see it so viscerally it affects their pocketbooks on civil rights even this is one that nobody on the Left is reporting on but even this week we are winning tremendously the DOJ under President Trump is reopening the case of the murder of Emmett Till of Emmett Till this murder happened in 1955 it's when a bunch of murderers killed 14 year old Emmett Till JW Milam and his half-brother Robert Bryant they killed him for allegedly flirting with a white woman there's no evidence really that he flirted with a white woman but they killed him for that he came in Emmett Till came in to town from Chicago and he was killed brutally murdered and and you know ripped apart and his mother actually demanded an open casket funeral to show the world how gory and awful this was and and by the way after they were acquitted a Milam was acquitted within an hour I think they said the all-white jury would have acquitted him sooner except they took a break to have a soda I mean this was no trial at all a total total show and Milam confessed this is what he said the murder of Emmett Till in 1956 a year later he said what else could we do he was hopeless I'm no bully I never hurt he was the word ninja let's just sing ninja I never heard a ninja in my life I like and words in their place I know how to work them but I just decided it was time a few people got put on notice as long as I can live and do anything about it and n words are gonna stay in their place and words ain't gonna vote where I live if they did they'd control the government I ain't gonna go to school with my kids and when an n-word gets close to mentioning sex with a white woman he's tired of living I'm likely to kill him me and my folks fought for this country we got some rights I stood there in that shed and listen to that n-word throw that poison at me and I just made up my mind Chicago boy I said I'm tired of him sending your kind down here to stir up trouble damn you I'm gonna make an example of you just so everybody can know how me and my folks stand and then he viciously killed him and tied his body to a weight and drowned him killed him in a river that was there was the admission now the the DOJ has new information they've said they haven't released any information on what that information is but they have reopened the case under President Trump and that is a very good thing so it's it's ironic that the the President Trump is being called a racist based on nothing by the way nobody called him a racist before he he ran for office as a Republican now all of a sudden he's a big racist they're calling him a racist this guy is focused pretty clearly on civil rights the example of this is not too long ago a president Trump issued a pardon for Jack Johnson Jack Johnson probably what is it now almost a hundred years later almost a century later Jack Johnson was the first black heavyweight champion boxer I'm not talking about the pop guitarist that only suburban white girls like Jack Johnson I'm talking about the heavyweight boxer black the first black heavyweight champ boxer so he Jack Johnson was serving a ten month stint at Leavenworth in 1921 and his crime basically was traveling with a white woman what he was convicted on was the Mann Act for bringing a prostitute across state lines the Mann Act was to stop human trafficking but Jack Johnson and Jack Johnson had a checkered past with women I'm not saying this guy was the same do you know but it was a consensual relationship he was in with this woman and he was basically arrested for for the racial crime of traveling with a white woman and Woodrow Wilson of course wouldn't grant him the pardon and both President Bush and President Obama were asked to pardon Jack Johnson posthumously and they said no it's not no we're not gonna do it I don't what's the point it's a it's a little dicey because he had a checkered past himself and don't want to do it president Trump heard about this and he said yeah let's do it of course that's justice it was injustice that he got arrested it was obviously a racial thing and we're gonna have pardoned him this is only the third posthumous pardon by any US president and president Trump did it why is this apparently strong focus on civil rights that's that's a pretty good thing I've got a second bite of Facebook in a second but I do want to clear up some questions on the court because this is the real area that we're winning and I think there's a little misinformation out there people a lot of conservatives were very excited about justice or judge Amy Kony Barrett because she seemed so rock-ribbed worked for Scalia very pro-life but more importantly would be a textualist and therefore the pro-life cause probably would win and this guy you know he doesn't cease doesn't seem quite as rock-ribbed to some people that said he's pretty good first of all they can't they have nothing on this guy The Washington Post found the big scandal on him the scandal is Supreme Court nominee piled up credit card debt by purchasing Nationals tickets so and by the way he paid off the credit card debt so that so basically the headline is Brett Kavanaugh used credit cards ever and went to America's favorite pastime he also likes Brett Kavanaugh piled up credit card debt eating apple pie okay sure you know and they and they said he doesn't have a lot he's not rich he only has assets between 15 and $60,000 that is a Brett Kavanagh has spent his career in the public sector as a judge if he were rich that would throw up red flags wouldn't it but he's there what they're saying is breaking Brett Kavanaugh apparently too upright a citizen to dignified a judge to soon make a lot of money on the side this is a very good thing so everything they try to throw at him it just doesn't work at all and he's got a ton of the pro-life credibility that's the other thing people are trying to say he won't overturn roe v wade who knows how he'll rule who knows if a court with cabin on it will overturn roe v wade it certainly seems it will whittle away at it but he's got a lot of pro-life cred he did say he did ruling Garza V Oregon that the as the ACLU tried to argue that's an illegal alien has some right to an abortion on demand he said that was ridiculous and that was right he ruled for the pre for life in priests for life roaches 8 vs HHS on the question of religious liberty and whether they have to provide a board of fashion drugs abortion drugs - - Chuck Schumer in 2006 he he did say that roe v wade is binding precedent but a lot of pro lifers are saying this is the scary this is the big red flag they said it's a binding precedent that's not a big deal only because he prefaced it he said if confirmed to the DC Circuit if confirmed sure as a lower court judge he can't overturn roe v wade of course not but the language but you have to watch the precise language earth judges used very precise language that's like their job you know he also they said the same thing about Gorsuch coursethe said similar things and nobody is saying that he's he's a weakling on abortion or on roe v wade and then during AEI speech American Enterprise Institute judge Cavanaugh said he alluded to the general tide of freewheeling judicial creation of unenumerated rights that were not rooted in the nation's history and tradition he's talking about roe v wade and that's pretty strong language the judicial creation of rights that were not rooted in the nation's history and tradition taking a pretty hard swing and he's talking about it in that if you read the speech carefully he starts talking about it right after he talks about slavery as this great flaw this great oversight this great American crime and I think that juxtaposition is important because the argument against abortion is is the argument against slavery you don't have a right to do something to another person to kill another person to steal their Liberty just to take their life you know the the argument for overturning roe v wade is a constitutional one the argument for pro-life is the same argument for abolition it's the same one you don't have a right to oppress people tyrannize people kill them take their labor and the fact that he's just opposing those two things that's a very good sign and then finally all right I've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube I'll talk about how we're winning the religious war then we'll have to get to the mailbag but before that before that if you're on facebook and youtube go to daily wire.com you're probably not on YouTube because YouTube's clamping down on us now YouTube actually is manipulating the subscription feed to curate your choices you might have seen this news article to curate your choices to put all the lefties up at the top and bury conservatives that means that users might not get notified if a channel goes live even if you subscribe to our channel so in order to make sure you still get notifications go to not only subscribe to daily wire on YouTube but also ring the little bell so that you will get subscriptions when we post content what do you get ten bucks a month hundred dollars for an annual membership you get me the Andrew Clavin show that Ben Shapiro show you get to ask questions in the mailbag you get to ask questions in the conversation none of that matters a banner week everything going well and drink the you're gonna need this to drink the Peter struck vintage right now I know he's not talking a lot on camera in this testimony but he or those tears flowing behind the camera offstage make sure you have this or you might drown when a daily wire calm we'll be right back a lot more of the show to go we're winning the religious war too this is the final this is kind of the foundational part of how we're winning so hard this week you've seen a lot of religious conversations come up it was spurred by this Supreme Court nomination fight because you had the fight over roe v wade you had the fight over people who are Catholic who are being nominated for this court you know they're members of cults according to the left so the New York Times ran this piece today called when politicians determine your religious beliefs and there's this religious divide in America and what they're trying to say well here's what it here's what they right quote at first glance president Trump's nomination of Judge Cavanaugh where the Supreme Court would seem a perfect reminder of why so many religious white Americans of vote Republican to promote conservative moral values religious values their values the values that the story goes devout white Protestants and Catholics want to see in Washington before we go on or what what does white have anything to do with it and really what does religion have anything to do with it I don't know if the New York Times is being obtuse here if or if they're just that stupid it's one of the two they're either being really obtuse or they're just being stupid that the fight is over constitutionality the fight is over whether there's a fake right to abortion in the Constitution there's obviously no right to abortion in the Constitution that's what the fight is about or we're going to interpret the Constitution by what it says or are we going to interpret it by what lefties fantasize it could say are we gonna have a rule of law we're gonna have a rule of nine robed dictators in the country leftist dictators that's what it's about it's nothing about religion really and it's certainly nothing about being white but the New York Times has to throw that in there because they either they don't have any idea what they're talking about or they're being really cynically obtuse the piece goes on there because there were some interesting parts in it quote it's not just that our religious beliefs affect our politics it's that our politics affect our religious choices we don't just take cues about politics from our pastors and priests we take cues about religion from our politicians analyzing these data I find that twenty-something Democrats and Republicans were equally secular you know when they're young teenagers 20-somethings they're equally secular most had pulled away from religion after high school and Democrats and Republicans did so it's similar rate but nine years later Republicans had become much more likely to attend church than their Democrat counterparts in contrast even those who bucked the secular trend and remained religious in their 20s were no more likely than less religious members of their cohort to join the Republican ranks in their 30s okay what why is that because I actually would do sort of grant them that premise that people but Republicans and Democrats fall away from religion largely in their teens and early 20s they come back to it and Republicans come back to it more more easily and more quickly why well for one New York Times perhaps this hasn't occurred to you that in your teens and 20s what are you doing you're exploring questions you're finally fully rational or approaching full rationality or finally a little bit educated at least and you start questioning the world around you you're no longer a little child you're becoming an adult you're figuring out what you think is it possible that people are analyzing religious questions and political questions at the same time when you were a young person did you analyze religious and political questions at the same time duh of course you did that's what people do they question everything around them they didn't say okay I'm gonna solve this question the political question then I'll have religious views not at all they both want to deny free will and rational choice and then say that one leads to the other necessarily it doesn't quite work and why else might this be the case well there is some social proof you know when you win if you're a lefty and you see all these other you think oh yeah I really like Obama you see all these other lefties mocking religion and people that you might respect mocking religion you say okay well I guess that's true I'll take a shortcut I won't think about the question too hard I'll just take this shortcut there's certainly that maybe you're compelled by the arguments of those who associate with I was agnostic bordering on atheism in my teens and early 20s and I would talk to people whose views I respected on politics and they might explain to me why I was wrong about religion and I might say oh well if you're right about all these other things maybe you're right about this too maybe I'm wrong it's called humility New York Times I know you know nothing about this but it's called intellectual humility and it's called intellectual curiosity nothing of which interests the New York Times and and of course the final reason is that we're leftist Democrats politics supplants religion when Diane Feinstein is worried that the dogma lives loudly within Catholics because the dog supplants the leftist dogma it means that there's no room for the leftist modern dogma to be there and that and Democrats who have everybody's got to serve somebody so if you don't serve God you're going to serve something else and you're gonna serve idols of politics be it environmentalism be its social justice redistribution Marxist ideology whatever you're going to serve something and unfortunately for for people on the left broadly and in the Democratic Party now broadly that is that's a question that is that's a void that's filled by shallow politics although the way we're winning on this too is that among the coalition of the ascendant to use the Democrats phrase blacks and Hispanic voters are more likely to agree with Republicans on questions of religion so it's splitting their own base it's splitting their own party very good news and maybe it'll bring them to the good Lord alright we've got a little bit of time left for mailbag I was running late today so let's jump right into it from Anthony hey Michael I'm a big fan while doing research into the case of roe v wade I was reading up on the Fourteenth Amendment which states all persons born or naturalized in the u.s. cannot be deprived of life liberty or property without due process my question is if the text specifically says born are naturalized would a child in the womb meet this standard as it's not yet born no I don't think it does I don't think the child in the womb I don't think abortion is unconstitutional because of the 14th amendment the language is clear born or naturalized in a child in the womb I don't think yet certainly hasn't been born I don't think it's been naturalized I don't think the way that we should stop abortion is by pretending that there's a constitutional prohibition against abortion there's certainly no constitutional right to abortion and there's no constitutional prohibition of it so roe v wade should be overturned because it's blatantly unconstitutional and then the question should be decided by the people and you know freedom is scary because people might decide to legalize murder and something morally similar to murder in certain states in New York California wherever but you'll I think you'll get much more of an ethic of life and if by the way if this is debated freely and we don't just pretend that there's either of right to an abortion or prohibition of abortion in the Constitution our side is gonna win I said this earlier in the show when you show reality we win because unlike leftist ideologue who say who cares if a work in practice doesn't work in theory I think the reality is on our side there's something about the conservative disposition that really favours the real the tangible the what we see before us and we don't really doubt our lyin eyes so much like the left does I think we shouldn't be afraid of freedom and we shouldn't play the game of the left of perverting the Constitution I think that's we're gonna lose that one in the long run next question from Garrett Lorde and Noel's I've heard an argument that we have no free will because we can't control our desires and all of our actions are based on what we want to do if you reply with examples of you acting against your desires a defender of this argument would reply that you only did that because you wanted to go against it and therefore we are back to square one what are your thoughts on this to me it seems like all it did was prove that we can create an ad hoc justification for any of our actions that means it's related to desires I'm unsure if this is a logical fallacy thanks and love the show yeah it's ridiculous it's what they're saying is unfalsifiable sentiment and nonsense obviously you can think of times that you act against your desires namely all of the time because there's a moral order you know if I'm walking down the street and I see a cute little lass you know well I would never feel any desire at all because I'm because sweet little ELISA listens to this show so I've got to make clear I don't even see other women it's like people who say they don't see color I don't even see them I just want said what are you hello sir nice to meet you I'm a lady yeah well sir I'm sorry I don't see gender but obviously people at stop they're sort of basis too animalistic desires because we have higher desires we have love for our wives why don't we why don't we just go cheap with every single woman we see because there's this base animalistic sexual attraction but then we have this higher love for our wives we have a moral order that we have to follow why don't we murder people that we don't like because there's a moral order that we follow obviously we butt against that now they say well really your desire is to follow the moral order sure but if what you're saying by the way is that we can't we cannot can ultimately everything is just determined by this animalistic thing then you have no rational faculties you have no faculties of reason to discern between two judgment to discern between a base desire and sort of higher calling or the right thing to do and if you have no faculties of reason then what you were saying is not reliable because you're not accessing truth you're just motivated by your natural desires if that's true you're an animal and you might be an animal you're a lefty friend might be an animal but you're not an animal and and if they say yes we have no rational faculties than what they're saying has no meaning they're there they're not actually making a rational statement they're just saying bah bah bah bah right it's like when people say there's no free will and I'd start punching them in the face and they'd say stop doing that I say I'm not doing it I have no free will it's just this was just preordained to happen I'm sorry I'm not even sorry because it's not my fault cuz I have no moral culpability it's a ridiculous argument and they're just making unfalsifiable sentimental claims from Alicia do we have time we have time for like a few more from Alicia Michael oh I don't know what language that's in what are the chances that the Dems would come up with a new candidate who would you pick for a Democrat nominee in 2020 that's easy Jim Acosta no question Jim Acosta won because he looks like a generic president you know he's just like a sort of glib guy with silly hair you know perfectly quaffed hair and everything which looks good on some people but Jim Acosta would also be a great choice because first of all he's the mouthpiece of Democrats he's he oh he only does is repeat Democrat talking points on on like automatic he's just on this automatic function and he's already on the CNN mouthpiece of Iran the Democrat mouthpiece of CNN he's already on their main communications platform so that would be pretty helpful and also it would really rile up the Democrats because he's a straight white man as far as I know so they're gonna say oh gosh he is he is the avatar of Democrats but we have to hate straight white guys now so what are what do we do about it Rarawa and they rip them apart and be really good and the the simpler answer is Hillary Clinton it looks like she may run might be more likely that she runs again but who knows if the Democrats will successfully reanimate that corpse in time for 2020 otherwise my money's on Jim Acosta from misty hi Michael one quick question good I'm glad I'm glad this is a quick question what is the quick question what does the Bible actually have to say about purgatory and whether or not it does exist spoiler alert this is not a quick question this will be a long question as myself I'm a Protestant and don't believe in purgatory and wanted to know a Catholics view on it because it doesn't give me a direct answer I don't have a direct answer okay thanks James sure happy to do that this is going to be a longer one it long story short purgatory is rooted in Scripture and in sacred tradition and it exists we see this where are some places in Scripture in Maccabees you see quote he turned to prayer beseeching that the sin which had been committed it might be wholly blotted out he also took up a collection and sent it to Jerusalem to provide for a sin offering in doing this he acted very well and honorably therefore he made atonement for the dead that they might be delivered from their sin so this is a clear example in Scripture of of people praying for the dead that the dead after they are dead might be delivered from sins that they had committed while they were alive so that I think that's a clear allusion to to purgatory now one trouble with the Protestant revolution is after the Protestant revolution various denominations just started taking out books of the Bible Martin Luther did this he said we're only gonna rely on Scripture but only the scripture that I like and all the one that I don't like I'm gonna pull out of the Bible I don't know if that's Sola scriptura buddy we also see this in the New Testament if you're not compelled by Maccabees in Matthew 12 whoever says a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come this is an enigmatic scripture I'm not going to explain or try to explain why speaking against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven but I will point out it says either in this age or in the age to come so our Lord is presenting a clear case that sins can be forgiven in this age or in the age to come so I that seems to validate what we saw in in Maccabees I don't think our Jesus misspeaks he doesn't really miss speak he speaks perfectly and there is a premise here that you can be forgiven for your sins in this age or in the age to come some sins then in Matthew 5 it's a little clearer make friends quickly with your accuser while you're going with him to court lest your accuser hand you over to the judge and the judge to the guard and you put in prison truly I say to you you will never get out till you have paid the last penny now I don't I don't think our Lord is being clever by half here I don't think he's saying and you'll never pay the last penny ha ha ha but he is saying you will pay for this you will have to there will be some consequence for your sins and but you can get out I don't think you say you can you can never get out you can get out in from certain sins in certain cases Tertullian in writing not long after the death of Christ and 208 ad describes that exactly as such and is parabolic but the clearest example if I haven't convinced you so far I hope I have is in first Corinthians which reads quote for no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid which is Jesus Christ now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble each man's work will become manifest for the day will disclose it because it will be revealed with fire and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done if the work which any man has built on the foundation survives he will receive a reward if any man's work is burned up he will suffer loss though he himself will be saved but only as through fire only as through fire and the image of purgatory is as a cleansing and self saving fire that purifies your refining fire that purifies you for heaven I know that certain denominations took out books of the Bible but I don't think they took out Corinthians so there's the scriptural evidence for that is there I'll take this one last quick one then we got a sign-off from Noah had an argument with two of my co-workers and they said Obama's economy was better than Trump's six the tax cuts my coworker has said thousands of people lost their jobs he showed me a Vox article or it stop right there he's going to show you like occupy Democrats Hey he showed me this meme on the internet okay he showed me a Vox article it was a list of 12 companies that were laying off employees because of because of the tax cuts okay overall or the tax cuts good why did these companies layoff so many people okay here's what you need to know we have a massive labor shortage in the country there are more jobs than people to fill them right now I do do companies sometimes fire people yeah do they fire people because they've just gotten more money to spend no that doesn't make any sense no company fires people because they now have more money through tax cuts no just look at the numbers we have a massive labor shortage I think I mentioned this earlier in the show jobless claims are at an almost forty four year low and we have the lowest unemployment in 18 years no it helped end the IMF admits by the way that the global economic boom is in part caused by President Trump and it's directly attributable to him so I think the main mistake your friend made was reading voxcom and and not retreating it like everyday feminism or whatever other ridiculous lefty dishonest sites there are okay that's all the time we have we have other great questions to get to but not enough time have a good weekend everybody I hope you can make it through and you know swim some laps and all those leftist tears and then I'll see you on Monday in the meantime I'm Michael Knowles and this
