1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:02,369
Cat videos are so
popular on the internet

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,404
that they have become
universal shorthand

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,406
for the internet itself.

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,442
Cats are the mascots
of being online.

5
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,144
They re the epitome
of distracting,

6
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,280
useless and comforting.
All that the internet is

7
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,082
at its best and at its worst.

8
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:17,684
It’s time for cat massage. 

9
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,121
Or at least that’s how we
used to think of the internet.

10
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,858
Because lately, dogs
are taking over.

11
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,127
The online rivalry
between cats and dogs

12
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,263
plays out like a battle for
the soul of the internet.

13
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,366
Think about Twitter, where
every dog is a very, very

14
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,436
good boy and every
cat is hell bent

15
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,405
on destroying civilization.

16
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,741
Or YouTube, where we watch
cats stalk their humans,

17
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,543
and humans shame their dogs.

18
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,212
“Did you do that
to the pillow?”

19
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,848
One pet turns its
owner into prey

20
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,950
and the other
cowers to authority,

21
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,986
looking guilty, as
if exhibiting a kind

22
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,155
of human moral compass.

23
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,057
Nowhere is this
dynamic clearer

24
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,525
than in the
differences between two

25
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,660
of Japan’s most
popular pets.

26
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,828
[speaking Japanese]

27
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,096
Maru the Dog.

28
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,065
[speaking Japanese]

29
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,933
And Maru the Cat.

30
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,802
One of them is a
happy-go-lucky man

31
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,203
about town.

32
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,472
And the other is
a sullen weirdo,

33
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,240
who lives out his
days attempting

34
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:22,749
to fit his body into a series
of impractical containers.

35
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,350
Of course, when we
talk about the rise

36
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,987
of dogs on the internet, we’re
not just talking about pets.

37
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,390
We’re talking about us.

38
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,691
Think about it.

39
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,927
Movies and TV shows
have traditionally

40
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,029
had a very strong
preference for dogs,

41
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,797
because they can be trained.

42
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,567
But even if cats
could be tamed,

43
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,603
they wouldn’t agree to it.

44
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,606
They represent our wild,
uncultured, disobedient

45
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:50,310
sides, the stuff we
Google late at night when

46
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,545
nobody else is watching.

47
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,014
They are the chaos agents
of the animal kingdom.

48
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,216
Meow. 

49
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,150
[explosion]

50
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,152
[shrieking]

51
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,920
And yet, if cats
are aggressive,

52
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,590
it’s in an ineffectual way.

53
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,060
Unlike a dog, a cat
couldn’t actually kill you.

54
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,662
Cats represent chaos
without any consequence,

55
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,431
which is kind of the
way we’ve been taught

56
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,833
to think about the
internet for a long time,

57
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,002
as a kind of
apolitical playground

58
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,505
where crazy stuff
happens, but one that’s

59
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,974
completely divorced from
the serious concerns

60
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,275
of real life.

61
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,512
[music]

62
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,647
The new rise of
dogs online tells us

63
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,750
something about how the
internet itself is changing.

64
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,720
We used to experience cats
online through janky message

65
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,755
boards populated with
memes and

66
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,290
viral YouTube videos

67
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,527
passed around by our friends.

68
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,428
Today’s internet,
though, is starting

69
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,964
to look more and
more like old media,

70
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,701
with big companies imposing
order, offering convenience

71
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,970
and extracting optimum value.

72
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,140
“The secret to making your
pet social media famous.”

73
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,176
Dogs represent this
professionalization

74
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,410
of the internet.

75
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,245
They can be dressed
up and made to perform

76
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:04,184
for their audiences in a
way that cats just won’t.

77
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,953
Maybe it’s not a surprise
that we’re also increasingly

78
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,821
turning to dog
content at a time

79
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,757
when social norms
are degrading.

80
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,825
Civil institutions
are crumbling,

81
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,161
and the weird antisocial
activities that happen

82
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,931
on the internet have
effects on real life, too  

83
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,266
sometimes terrifying ones.

84
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,204
The lawlessness of cats,
like the internet itself,

85
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,906
is no longer comforting.

86
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,742
Loyal, docile dogs who
do what they’re told

87
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,311
and who get along
with people and wear

88
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,380
bow ties, that’s comforting.

89
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,282
Now we’re even
starting to see a rise

90
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:40,353
in the popularity of internet
cats who act like dogs  

91
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,022
adventure cats who hike
with their owners, trudge

92
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:46,759
through the snow, and
swim, like in water.

93
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,562
We like these cat-dogs for
the same reason we’re drawn

94
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,365
to images of animals
acting like human beings  

95
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,901
getting haircuts,
and taking showers  

96
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,770
or animals who act against
instinct to make friends

97
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,105
with one another.

98
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,808
These videos reflect the hope
that we can restore order

99
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,310
to the internet, rein
it in and integrate it

100
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,946
into civil society,
that we can literally

101
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,047
take internet culture  

102
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:08,881
[shrieking]

103
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,316
and put it on a leash.

104
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,884
“Right, Dolce?”

105
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,219
Look, I get it.

106
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,789
But let’s not punish cats
for the sins of the internet.

107
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,892
This is about us, not them.

108
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,027
Hey, this is Amanda.

109
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:21,628
This is Shane.

110
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,795
He edits the videos.

111
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:23,896
She writes the videos. 

112
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:24,864
You watch the videos.

113
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,065
And if you like the videos,

114
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,934
like, comment and
subscribe here.

115
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,168
And then tell us:

116
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,603
Cats or dogs?

117
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,704
Or birds?

118
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,139
Leave your answer
in the comments.

119
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,174
We are very thirsty.

120
00:04:35,174 --> 00:00:00,000
[singing] “Internetting
with Amanda Hess.”
