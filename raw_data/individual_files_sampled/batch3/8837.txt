WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT MASSIVE GROUP OF PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE, WHEN YOU SAW IT ON THE BRIDGE, THE GROUP, I REALLY THINK THAT IT PROBABLY SPELLS OUT TO US AND CONGRESS SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE. WE'LL HAVE TO CALL UP OUR MILITARY, IF WE NEED. TO SAY BUT WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN. WE CANNOT ALLOW OUR COUNTRY TO BE VIOLATED LIKE THIS. STEVE: THERE YOU HAVE GOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES YESTERDAY IN THE OVAL OFFICE TALKING ABOUT THE CARAVAN. KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SHE JOINS US FROM THE NORTH LAWN. KELLYANNE, SO MUCH HAS BEEN MADE OF THIS CARAVAN OF ABOUT 7,000. NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS A SECOND ONE THAT IS PARKED IN GUATEMALA. AND I THINK THERE IS 2500 THERE. WHAT IS GOING ON? WELL THE CARAVAN IS A SYMBOL OF BROKEN PROMISES AND FAILED POLICIES BY THE DEMOCRATS. EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR HAS SIGNED ONTO THE FEINSTEIN IDEA FOR OPEN BORDERS. AND AS HAVE YOU PRESIDENT OBAMA FECKLESSLY AND RECKLESSLY TRYING TO TAKE CREDIT FOR THE TRUMP ECONOMY. HE OUGHT TO TAKE CREDIT OR BLAME FOR WHAT WE ARE SEEING AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. THEY DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO CURB THE INFLUX OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COMING OVER THIS BORDER. LOOK, I'M, YOU KNOW, EQUAL PARTS COMPASSION AND TITANIUM. I WILL TELL YOU THAT I FEAR THAT MANY OF THE HONDURAN NATIONALS WERE PROMISED THINGS THAT WON'T BE DELIVERED, GIVEN, I THINK, PROMISES THAT CAN'T BE FULFILLED BOY THE COYOTES CHARGING THEM SO MUCH MONEY OR OTHER FOLKS NOT TELLING THEM WHAT A TREACHEROUS JOURNEY THIS COULD BE. YOU SEE THE NEWS STATISTICS SHOW THAT OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE TRY TO CROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY LAST YEAR. AND WE HAVE THIS INCREASE IN FAMILIES TRYING TO CROSS OVER. BUT WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW THAT THEY ARE FAMILY UNITS. YOU CAN HAVE ONE MALE GRABBING SOMEONE ELSE'S KID AND PRETEND GO AHEAD THEY ARE A FAMILY UNIT. I'M VERY CONCERNED EVEN ONE OF THOSE HAPPENS. YOU KNOW WELL IT'S HAPPENING. THE CHILD SMUGGLING AND DRUG SMUGGLING. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHO IS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. DEMOCRATS DON'T ACT. THEY WENT FOR ALL THE FOPS DOWN AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. THEY ARE COMPLETELY RADIO SILENT ON THIS. SECRETARY POMPEO IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE ARE THE WORLD'S MOST GENEROUS NATION. 33 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE IMMIGRATED HERE LEGALLY. MANY WE ALL KNOW AND PEOPLE SHOULD TRY TO DO THAT LEGALLY. BRIAN: SENATOR SCHUMER TALKED IN THE PAST ABOUT THE NEED TO STOP ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM COMING IN HERE. SENATOR HARRY REID TALKED ABOUT THE IDIOCY OF CHAIN MIGRATION HOW RIDICULOUS IT IS. BARACK OBAMA IN 2005 TALKED ABOUT YOU CAN'T JUST WALK INTO OUR COUNTRY UNINCUMBERED BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR TO PEOPLE HERE. WHAT HAPPENED? DID PEOPLE NOT KNOW VCRS WERE ROLLING THAT WE KNEW WHERE THEY STOOD? WHAT CHANGED? IT'S DELICIOUS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED? DONALD TRUMP GOT ELECTED AND GOT ELECTED OVERWHELMINGLY IN SOME STATES BECAUSE OF ISSUES LIKE THIS. HE IS SAYING THAT WE'RE A SOVEREIGN NATION. WE NEED PHYSICAL BORDERS. AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHO IS HERE. YOU CAN IMGRATE LEGALLY. AND, ALSO, THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY FORTH RIGHT FOR OVER THREE YEARS NOW TALKING ABOUT NOT JUST THE PEOPLE COMING IN ILLEGALLY BUT THE DRUGS THAT ARE POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY. 90% OF HEROIN COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY COMES THROUGH OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. WE HAVE INCREASES IN COCAINE COMING. IN NOW, FENTANYL. FOLK HE IS, MARK IT DOWN. LEARN THE WORD FENTANYL RESPONDS CYBIL FOR 30,000 AMERICAN DEATHS JUST LAST YEAR. IT'S COMING IN INCREASINGLY THROUGH OUR SOUTHERN BORDER AND BEING MANUFACTURED? CHINA. TALKING PRESIDENT POISON COMING INTO OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND THIS NEEDS TO STOP. THIS IS A FAILURE OF THE DEMOCRATS NOT TO ACT. THE PRESIDENT, MY BOSS LAST JANUARY IN THE CABINET ROOM FOR ONE HOUR ON LIVE TV SAID HE WOULD DO A DEAL ON THE DREAMERS. HE WANTED TO END CHAIN MIGRATION, END THE VILS IS A LOTTERY SYSTEM. GET THAT WALL BUILT AND HE WOULD DO A DEAL ON THE DREAMERS. THE DEMOCRATS NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD MAKE GOOD ON THAT. HE CALLED THEIR BLUFF YET AGAIN. THEY WALKED AWAY FROM THE TABLE NEVER TO BE GERALDO OF AGAIN. AINSLEY: KELLYANNE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE CARAVAN HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE THEM THEY WILL BE UP TO OUR BORDER IN A FEW WEEKS. KNOW SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY AND MIKE LEE WE HAVE A COPY THE LETTER HERE TO KIRSTJEN NIELSEN WITH HOMELAND SECURITY. THEY HAVE A SOLUTION. THEY SAID LIKE WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST IN 2002 WITH CANADA, MAYBE THIS WOULD WORK WITH MEXICO. REQUIRE THE MIGRANTS TO STOP IN MEXICO AND SEEK ASYLUM THERE AND MEXICO WOULD HAVE TO AGREE TO DO THAT? WILL IT WORK. MEXICO HAS BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE HERE AND I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. THEY HAVE OFFERED TO I HAVE THINK GRANT TEMPORARY VISAS OR ASYLUM THERE AS I UNDERSTANDING IT, MANY IN THE CARAVAN ARE PUSHING FORWARD AND REFUSING THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM IT'S ESTIMATE YOU HAD ARE ECONOMIC MIGRANTS. NOT THOSE THAT HAVE A OF ASYLUM. THAT'S VERY INSTRUCTIVE TOO TO MY OTHER POINT. WE HAVE TO TRY WHAT'S BEEN TRIED IN THE PAST. AT LEAST YOU HAVE REPUBLICAN SENATORS LIKE THE TWO YOU JUST MENTIONED TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. YOU HAVE GOT DEMOCRATS OUT THERE RUNNING FOR 2020. THEY HAVE DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN 2018 TO SECURE OUR BORDERS. TO KEEP US DRUG-FREE AND SAFE. THEY ALL VOTED AGAINST TAX CUTS THAT ARE STEM A LITTLE OUR STR STIMULATINGOUR ECONOMY. BLUE COLLAR WAGES ARE UP. WAGES FOR EVERYBODY ARE UP. UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN. OPTIMISM IS SURGING. THE STOCK MARKET, THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE STILL STRONG UNDER THE TRUMP ECONOMY. DID YOU SEE KAMALA HARRIS YESTERDAY? SHE WAS AT SOME COLLEGE IN IOWA FOR AN EVENT AND ABOUT 12 PEOPLE WERE IN THE PICTURE? 12? IT'S LIKE CAN I INVITE YOU OVER FOR DINNER TONIGHT AND HAVE MORE PEOPLE. DO YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO SELL THINGS THAT NOBODY IS BUYING. WHY ISN'T SHE AT THE BORDER SAYING, FOLKS, LET'S COME IN LEGALLY. I AGREE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA FROM 2005. I THINK EVERY CANDIDATE SHOULD BE ASKED DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA FROM 2005. HE IS OUT THERE TRYING TO TAKE CREDIT FOR A TRUMP ECONOMY. YOU KNOW WHAT? TO QUOTE OBAMA FROM 2004. HE DIDN'T BUILD. THIS HE DIDN'T BUILD THAT ECONOMY. PRESIDENT TRUMP DID AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. STEVE: DEMOCRAT WOULD RATHER TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT'S A WINNER FOR THEM AND NOT IMMIGRATION. THEY ARE WRONG THERE, TOO. 20 MILLION AMERICANS, IT'S ESTIMATED, STILL DON'T HAVE ANY TYPE OF HEALTH INSURANCE 8 AND A HALF YEARS AFTER OBAMACARE. IT WAS A DISALSER FOR MANY AMERICANS. THIS PRESIDENT HAS PUT FORTH ASSOCIATED HEALTH PLANS, SHORT-TERM DURATION PLANS. DRUFING PRIVACIES ARE GOING DOWN. TODAY HE IS SIGNING HISTORIC LEGISLATION ON THE OPIOID CRISIS HR-6. STEVE: THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT. INCREDIBLE. PASSED 98 TO 1 IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE THE SAME WEEK THE KAVANAUGH VOTE WAS HAPPENING. THINK ABOUT THAT. MOST HYPER PARTISAN DIVIDED WEEK ON CAPITOL HILL SINCE WE HAVE GOTTEN HERE AND YET THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP FORGED THE MOST HISTORIC COMPREHENSIVE SINGLE PEELS OF LEGISLATION ON ANY ONE DRUG CRISIS IN OUR NATION'S HIS INDUSTRY. THERE IS MORE MONEY IN THERE. THERE IS INCREASING ACCESS TO TREATMENT. MORE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERDICTION. STRENGTHEN THOSE PENALTIES AGAINST HIGH LEVEL DRUG TRAFFICKERS. HELP THOSE BABIES. WE HAVE 150 NEWBORNS COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY EVERY DAY STRUGGLING FOR FIRST BREATH. A GREAT ISSUE THAT OUR FIRST LADY HAS HE WILL VATED YOU HAD. BIG DAY BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION. BRIAN: WILL THERE BE A DEMOCRAT REPRESENTED THERE FOR THE SIGNING CEREMONY. YES THERE IS A DEMOCRAT COMING. MANY ARE OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND MAYBE OTHERS DON'T WANT TO COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE ARE WE GLAD THAT SENATORS NAMES WARREN AND KAMALA HARRIS AND CORY BOOKER. AND JOE MANCHIN, OTHERS CAME FORWARD AND VOTED FOR THESE THIS OPIOID PACKAGE. EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR VOTE I HAD FOR A LAW THAT PUMP WILL SIGN IN AND WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT HIS LEADERSHIP. HE HAS ELEVATED THE OPIOID AND DRUG CRISIS FROM DAY ONE OF HIS ADMINISTRATION. LIVES BEING SAVED THE NUMBERS OF PRESCRIPTION GOING DOWN 30 PILLS TO FIVE OR SEVEN. ALEX AZAR HAS NOTED YOU OPIOID DEATHS ARE LEVELING OFF. IT'S A CRISIS NEXT DOOR DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE BY GENDER, RACE, SOBER YEAR ECONOMIC OR SOC RACE, SOBER YEAR ECONOMIC OR SOO RACE, SOBER YEAR ECONOMIC OR SOC RACE, SOBER YEAR ECONOMIC OR SON RACE, SOBER YEAR ECONOMIC OR SOM RACE, SOBER YEAR ECONOMIC OR SOC RACE, SOBER YEAR ECONOMIC OR SO. WE'RE GETTING MORE OF THE FENTANYL OUT OF THE COUNTRY. LET ME SAY ONE LAST FEATURE IN THIS. OUR U.S. POSTAL SERVICE NOW MUST PROVIDE TO CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION FOR EVERY PACKAGE COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY, INCLUDING FROM CHINA AND MEXICO, ADVANCED ELECTRONIC DATA. THAT'S GOING TO CUT DOWN ON THESE ILLEGAL STUFF LIKE FENTANYL COMING IN HERE.
