1
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,940
the Business Insider is hereby calling

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,410
for the immediate resignation of

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,740
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner why five

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,230
reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through them one Tim</font>

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,269
Geithner is directly responsible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

6
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">most appalling corporate bailout in the</font>

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">United States history AIG last fall</font>

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,410
received tens of billions<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dollars</font>

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,899
directly from the taxpayer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money was</font>

10
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,340
funneled through AIG to dozens of

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,780
corporations that are now proclaiming

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,760
that they never needed the money they

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,170
never needed it they'd never should have

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,210
gotten it now we know from the emails

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,489
we've seen the new york fed in fact took

16
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,239
steps to conceal this fact from the

17
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,070
united states public whose money it was

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,930
Tim Geithner should be held responsible

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,210
for the AIG bailout as we've long

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,059
believed number two Tim Geithner's

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,510
policy and reason for saving the banks

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,099
and always putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wall Street first has</font>

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,840
been that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to so the bank's can</font>

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,360
continue to lend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy is now</font>

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,790
officially a failure banks are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,700
lending they are hoarding cash they are

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,860
also buying Treasuries so effectively

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,850
their lending money to the government

29
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,009
but that's not the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saved them</font>

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,630
the Fed can print its own money it

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,520
doesn't need it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the banks banks are</font>

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,650
not lending so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for putting</font>

33
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wall Street first has now been</font>

34
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,900
eliminated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and proved wrong number three</font>

35
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,299
Tim Geithner's policy too big to fail

36
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,509
has now ensured that a big segment of

37
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,360
our economy the big wall street banks

38
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,350
effectively have a government<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee</font>

39
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,270
this has basically been written<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

40
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,520
Constitution at this point it's creating

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,500
havoc throughout the economy starting

42
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,450
with the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Wall Street now has a</font>

43
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,420
guarantee roll the dice taxpayers lose

44
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,909
no matter what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can win we'll pick up</font>

45
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">the body the downside that is just</font>

46
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,320
simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ludicrous policy we are</font>

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,240
sticking with it there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been some</font>

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,280
noise that we maybe have to change this

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,110
at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it is not happening</font>

50
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,299
now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government comes out basically</font>

51
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">says we will save anybody that is a tim</font>

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,139
geithner policy he has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

53
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,080
responsibility for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or Tim Geithner's</font>

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,660
decision

55
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,520
both this Treasury secretary but then

also at<font color="#CCCCCC"> AIG have fueled an incredible</font>

57
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,010
populists outrage and the problem with

this is that even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it doesn't lead to</font>

59

60
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,120
totally tying the government's hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,690
government will be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do nothing in</font>

64
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,210
part because of bailouts like AIG and

65
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,770
the way they were handled in terms of

66
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">this cloak of secrecy again Tim Geithner</font>

67
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,240
is directly responsible for AIG and

68
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,550
certainly for too big to fail and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,800
large part for this populists<font color="#CCCCCC"> outrage</font>

70
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,590
lastly and perhaps most importantly to a

71
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,090
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who support President</font>

72
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,610
Obama Tim Geithner is dragging down

73
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,580
Obama he is hurting his ability to enact

74
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,920
his agenda make policy hurting his

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,650
influence on AIG specifically President

76
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,200
Obama had absolutely nothing to do with

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,840
AIG yet it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still in the headlines we</font>

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,670
continue to get news about it Tim

79
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,960
Geithner meanwhile was directly

80
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,080
responsible again should step down to

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,450
preserve<font color="#CCCCCC"> his boss now we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stress</font>

82
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,970
is not personal Tim Geithner from

83
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,650
everyone we talked to the ministration

84
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,450
who has interacted with<font color="#E5E5E5"> him is a very</font>

85
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">good guy we have no doubt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that he acted</font>

86
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:26,890
at doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> what he thought was best for</font>

87
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country but the rationale all the</font>

88
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,330
way along has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been we had to do this or</font>

89
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,310
the world would have ended that's not

90
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">good enough first it's debatable but</font>

91
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,450
second is just not good enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

92
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,740
does not rinse his<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands of</font>

93
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,480
responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the decisions he made</font>

94
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,360
so again we stress our call at the

95
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,160
Business Insider for the resignation of

96
00:03:45,160 --> 00:00:00,000
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner
