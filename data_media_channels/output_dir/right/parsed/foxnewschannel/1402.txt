GREG: A 5-GALLON TUB OF ICE
CREAM AND MICHAEL'S MORE BED --
IT DOES NOT EVEN NEED A
PROTOTYPE.
THE DEMOCRATS MENTOR MADE IS
DISAPPEARING FAST TRACK I GOT TO
APPLAUSE LINES.
THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS THE DEMS
HAVE LOST A THIRD OF ITS LEAD IN
THE LAST TWO MONTHS IN THE SAME
TIMEFRAME TRUMPS POPULARITY IS
RISING IN PLACES WHERE DEMS
THOUGHT THEY HAD A CHANCE.
ORANGE COUNTIES, CALIFORNIA.
THEREFORE TIGHT RACES THERE BUT
TRUMPS APPROVAL RATING GREW TEN
POINTS IN THE LAST COUPLE
MONTHS.
THEY DON'T CALL IT ORANGE FOR
NOTHING.
KIND OF OBVIOUS.
COMPANIES GIVE BONUSES TO THEIR
EMPLOYEES AFTER TRUMPS TAX CUTS
LIKE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO
REMINDED NANCY PELOSI AT A TOWN
HALL THAT SHE CALLED THE BONUSES
CRUMBS.
>> IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT CRUMBS
TO THEM.
MY QUESTION IS WHAT CAN YOU ADD
TO THIS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD
ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH OF
JOBS AND WAGES IN OUR COUNTRY?
>> IT'S ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE
OF BUSINESSES SHARED THEIR TAX
ADVANTAGE WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES
SO LET US THANK --
GREG: APPLAUDING HER OWN
COMMENT.
SHE WILL NEVER LIVE DOWN THAT
CRUMBS LINE.
IF LIKE ME IN THAT INCIDENT AND
WALMART.
TECHNICALLY, I WAS WEARING
PANTS.
MY ADVICE TO DEMOCRATS IS
NOT HAVING SOLUTIONS AND ALSO
HAVE THIS PERSON CAMPAIGN FOR
EVERYONE.
>> HAVING SAID ALL THIS, WHY
AREN'T I 50 POINTS AHEAD, YOU
MIGHT ADD?
GREG: CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
CHRIS, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON
THE DEMOCRATIC BECAUSE THERE'S A
BLUE WAVE TURNING INTO A BLUE
GRAVE?
>> MY IMMEDIATE THOUGHTS WERE I
LIKE THE GUYS ENERGY WHO HAS THE
QUESTION.
HE WAS PULLING UP ALL DAY AND
I'M AN ESSAY  SO THEN
HE WAS LIKE WHEN HE SAID CRUMBS
HE SAID CRUMBS LIKE -- YOU KNOW
I WAS JUST WAITING FOR BE LIKE
NAILED IT UNDER HIS BREATH.
BUT, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T NOTICE IT BECAUSE I
ALWAYS LISTEN TO PAUL'S BUT YOU
DON'T NOTICE WHENEVER TRUMP
SUPPORTER IS UP OR DOWN AND
PRETTY MUCH IT'S THE SAME BUT
EVERY NOW AND THEN THERE'S A
TRINKET OF A FRIEND IS NOT AS
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO B
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO B-
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BI
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO B'
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BS
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BL
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BK
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BE
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BT
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BE
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BN
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BW
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BC
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BM
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BN
MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BG
OUT.
IT'S COMING OUT AS A TRUMP
SUPPORTER.
GREG: IT'S TRUE.
>> IT'S THE NEW THING AND
PARENTS NOW, CONSERVATIVE
PARENTS, TALK TO THE KIDS AND WE
LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT AND WE
LOOK TO YOUR INTERNET HISTORY,
SEARCHING FOR A PARTICULAR RED
HAT AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING.
GREG: IT IS SO TRUE.
YOU SEE CELEBRITIES PUTTING
THEIR TOE IN THE WATER SAYING
MAYBE GIVE THE GUY A CHANCE.
IT'S EXACTLY LIKE COMING OUT FOR
HOLLYWOOD AFTER.
NOT THAT I WOULD NO, TYRUS.
CAN THE REPUBLICAN STILL SCREW
THIS UP?
TYRUS: WHY THE HELL YOU TALKING
TO ME ABOUT COMING OUT?
I SCREAM 
GREG: CAN THE REPUBLICANS MESSES
UP.
TYRUS: NO, THEY DON'T HAVE TO.
STATISTICALLY TYPICALLY WHEN
THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE
PRESIDENCY USUALLY IN THE
MIDTERMS GO THE OTHER WAY BUT
THE TENANTS TO BE A BALANCE
THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC HOUSE OR
SENATE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IN
THE HOUSE IS USUALLY
BOTCHED THIS UP GOING ALL THE
WAY BACK TO OBAMA.
OBAMA ONE IN SPITE OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THEY ARE IN
SUCH SHAMBLES THEY HAVE NOTHING
THEY ARE RUNNING ON OTHER THAN
WE DON'T LIKE THAT GUY AND THAT
IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN VOTE
FOR.
GREG: THAT'S A GOOD POINT ABOUT
OBAMA.
THEY RELIED SO MUCH ON OBAMA
DIDN'T FIX THE PARTY.
TYRUS: AND NOW THE PARTY --
POSTAL MEAN ANYTHING.
WE LEARNED THAT.
LITERALLY POSE MEAN ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING BUT IF YOU FOLLOW THE
POLLS HILLARY WON IN A LANDSLIDE
BUT THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.
POLES ARE MISLEADING.
THE BIG LEAD WAS NEVER A BIG
LEAD.
I THINK MOST TRUMP SUPPORTERS
AND MOST PUBLICANS THAT WENT
THAT WAY WERE LIVING THEIR LIVES
IN PARTING AND NOT ANSWERING THE
PHONE TO SAMPLING DEMOCRAT
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE
THAT WANT TO BE HEARD AND I
DON'T THINK OR HEAR ANY
SOLUTIONS OR IDEAS.
GREG: SOMETIMES THAT CAN WORK,
ROB, BUT AMERICANS ARE GETTING
USED TO THE IDEA OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP SAID WHEN THEY HEAR THE
NEGATIVITY THEY SEE IT AS A
NEGATIVE PERSON'S FLAWS NOT
TRUMPS.
>> THAT IS THE ISSUE.
I'M FORTUNATE BUT I TRAVELED
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND SPEAK TO
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PERSONALLY A
WEEK AND THEY'RE TIRED OF THE
IMPEACHED TALK.
THE TIDE OF THE NEGATIVITY.
THEY WANT AMERICA TO WORK
TOGETHER IN THE MEDIA WILL NOT
TELL YOU THAT.
LIKE I SAID, I SAT ON HIS COUCH
AND HAD SOMEONE SAID THAT THE
WAY THAT DONALD TROUBLE GET
ELECTED BECAUSE THE POLLS SAY
THIS.
NANCY PELOSI IS UP THERE SAYING
AND APPLAUDING HER OWN COMMENTS
AS A THIS DOES WORK FOR MOST AND
YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW BUT SHE'S
NEVER RUN OF BUSINESS.
SHE'S A POLITICIAN.
SHE'S -- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO
THE 12th CONGRESSIONAL
DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO?
IT'S NOT LIKE THE STUFF COMING
OUT OF HER MOUTH.
IT'S SO BAD.
542 COMPANIES
542 COMPANIES, PRIVATE
BUSINESSES, GAVE PAY RAISES AND
BONUSES WITH NEW BENEFITS BASED
ON THE TAX CUTS AND ALL SHE'S
BEEN ABLE TO SAY IS WE GET THE
HOUSE, WILL IMPEACH AND RAISE
YOUR TAXES.
I MIGHT BE EATING CRAZY DAMAGES
BUT HOW DO YOU VOTE FOR THAT?
GREG: THE IDEA OF CRAZY
SANDWICHES SOUND LIKE FUN.
KAT, IF YOU ARE RUNNING WOULDN'T
KAT, IF YOU ARE RUNNING WOULDN'-
KAT, IF YOU ARE RUNNING WOULDN'W
KAT, IF YOU ARE RUNNING WOULDN'U
KAT, IF YOU ARE RUNNING WOULDN'D
KAT, IF YOU ARE RUNNING WOULDN'Y
KAT, IF YOU ARE RUNNING WOULDN'U
KAT, IF YOU ARE RUNNING WOULDN'S
KAT, IF YOU ARE RUNNING WOULDN'E
KAT, IF YOU ARE RUNNING WOULDN'L
KAT, IF YOU ARE RUNNING WOULDN'A
PAGE FROM TRUMP OR WOULD YOU
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
KAT: IN MY OPINION, THE
DEMOCRATS ARE NOT READY FOR
LEADERSHIP ANY MORE THAN SOMEONE
WHO IS STILL GETTING OVER AND
ASK IS READY FOR A NEW
RELATIONSHIP.
THEY ARE STILL IN THE FACE WITH
A CAN'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE
EXCEPT FOR THE PERSON WHO BROKE
HER HEART, DONALD TRUMP, AND
THAT WILL NOT ATTRACT VOTERS
ANYMORE THAN IT WOULD ATTRACT A
NEW PARTNER.
BASICALLY, THE MAQUETTES ARE THE
DRUNK GIRL ON THE FIRST DATE
THAT JUST KEEPS BABBLING ON
ABOUT HER EX-BOYFRIEND AND HOW
HE IS SUCH A JERK AND SHE
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE
DOESN'T GET A CALL BACK THE NEXT
DAY.
THEY NEED TO MOVE ON, GET OVER
IT OR THE NEVER WIN ANYTHING.
GREG: EVERY GUY HERE IS NOT IN
THEIR HEAD.
TYRUS: BEEN THERE.
BEEN THERE.
GREG: IF YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD
TO A FIRST DATE AND IT'S BEFORE
THEY COULD CHECK THE PHONE.
>> I HAVE NOT BEEN THAT FAR WHEN
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FIRST
DATE.
I'M STILL WORKING ON THAT.
GREG: GREAT METAPHOR.
I LOVE A GREAT METAPHOR.
