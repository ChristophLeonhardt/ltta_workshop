well I love hearing about black girl magic I think it's amazing I love that it really soared after the Olympics because it's true about representation and really inspiring others to whether it's athletics or whatever it is just knowing that they can go after their dreams and it doesn't matter where you come from how you're brought up that you can really reach your goals I definitely had no idea that the World Championships that are opening pose would blow up the way that it did and my teammates wanted to get creative with it and so came came up with that and it was just something different it was the first year that they were having like an entrance with music and stuff like that and so it was just something cool but we had no idea where it would go the four by one in Brazil was a really crazy race because we had had an incident earlier where when I was running the baton in there was a collision with an outgoing runner and so we actually dropped the baton got disqualified got put back in the race had a run all by ourselves alone on the track which was the strangest thing and so I think by going through all that adversity and coming back together it really just made us stronger and so when we got on the track and had the chance to compete for gold we just went went after it and thankfully we're able to to run a really fast time and win a gold medal I think it's really important to be an african-american woman at the Olympics I think representation is extremely important for me it's a privilege and an honor to be there representing and knowing that little girls and boys are back home and hopefully they find inspiration from this I know for myself that was true I watched Dominique Dawes and I was fascinated by her and her performance in the Olympics and I really want to do the same the Olympus is always gonna be your biggest stage and it's always where you want to perform the most but you'll definitely have races that are just as competitive some that are more competitive and you're constantly seeing this high level of competition but the Olympics always raises the stakes because not only do you have to face this competition but you also have to perform on the world's biggest stage yeah so right now I'm getting ready for this season but beyond that I'm excited for world championships in 2019 and then I would love to end my career by making a fifth Olympic team so that's my big goal working hard to be able to make a fifth and final team
