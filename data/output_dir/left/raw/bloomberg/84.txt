1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,097
(elevator music)

2
00:00:02,097 --> 00:00:04,878
This young man is Dakota Sembler

3
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:06,776
and he has it all.

4
00:00:06,776 --> 00:00:09,236
A flamingo patterned car.

5
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:12,069
An office that couldn't quit 1971.

6
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:16,657
A bunch of surplus military gear,

7
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:19,407
and then this incredible machine.

8
00:00:20,244 --> 00:00:22,411
An all electric semi-truck

9
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:25,133
that is both a salute,

10
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:28,173
and a giant middle finger to Elon Musk.

11
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:31,423
(intense techno music)

12
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:41,336
Dakota is the CEO of
a two year old company

13
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:44,641
called Thor Trucks based
in North Hollywood.

14
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:46,499
Thor's one of a handful of companies

15
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:48,642
trying to bring electric drive trains

16
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:51,189
to really big vehicles.

17
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,410
Really we set out to solve the issue

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,589
that fleets are having right
now with diesel vehicles.

19
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,940
A lot of that surrounds around compliance,

20
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,136
maintenance, the cost
of fuel, cost of energy,

21
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:02,663
so we were trying to set out to solve

22
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,766
a lot of those problems that fleets have.

23
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,633
In November, Elon Musk unveiled

24
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,387
this sucker at an event in LA.

25
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:14,124
Musk said the Tesla semi
rig will cost $180,000.

26
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:16,795
Go 500 miles on a single charge,

27
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:19,070
and recharge in about 30 minutes.

28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,987
When it arrives at the end of 2019.

29
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,607
I came to visit Thor
to see what a real life

30
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:28,857
electric semi can do today.

31
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:31,708
Thor got started in a warehouse

32
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,693
when Dakota bought a diesel truck

33
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,123
and hired a team to convert it.

34
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:38,798
They replaced the engine
with an electric motor,

35
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,431
they built some battery packs,

36
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:45,098
then they slapped a
giant screen in the cab.

37
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:47,060
Tell me about the logo.

38
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,707
It looks almost like Tesla meets
Transformers kind of thing.

39
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:53,014
Part of what we're trying
to do is really exude

40
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:55,933
kind of the power that EVs can provide.

41
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:56,948
When you think about EVs,

42
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:59,304
particularly when you're talking
about commercial vehicles,

43
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:01,451
people are like "they're
weak, they're not strong."

44
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:02,504
So you're Thor's hammer.

45
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:03,641
Yeah, and it's tough,

46
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:06,182
and it's a brand that people
will really come to be known

47
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:08,959
as kind of the tough EV brand.

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,981
This prototype truck is called ET1,

49
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:14,782
and Tom here agreed to
take me out for a spin

50
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:16,282
with his mustache.

51
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:21,330
When I first looked at
the truck I thought,

52
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,323
I thought, "Well, don't quite
know that's going to work."

53
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:27,613
Electric trucks are going

54
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:29,278
to cost more than diesel rigs,

55
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:31,064
have shorter driving ranges,

56
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:34,099
and require a charging
infrastructure to be built,

57
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,574
but Tom thinks they have a chance.

58
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:40,544
The way this thing pulls
is really unbelievable

59
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:41,802
for an electric vehicle.

60
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:43,211
So you were surprised the
first time you jumped in.

61
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:44,336
Oh yeah.

62
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:46,336
I was shocked more like.

63
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:48,385
If nothing else,

64
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,434
the truck is getting attention.

65
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:52,183
Is that the Tesla?

66
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:54,415
No, this is a Thor Truck.

67
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:55,709
Yeah, it's electric.

68
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,967
Wow, it's like futuristic.

69
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:00,505
Are you shittin me? It's electric?

70
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:03,755
No, I'm serious, I'll show it to you.

71
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:09,694
No, you see the electric motor?

72
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:10,527
Oh damn!

73
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:17,896
Thor expects this truck to cost $150,000

74
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:22,063
for 300 miles of range when
it goes on sale in 2019.

75
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:25,445
And they're quiet, run clean,

76
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:27,339
and have amazing pick up.

77
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:30,860
You know the power in this
thing is unbelievable,

78
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,527
the way it takes off
and the way it handles.

79
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,741
It speaks for itself.

80
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,401
Thor has 18 employees,

81
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:45,413
including a handful with deep
electric vehicle expertise.

82
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:48,207
The start up bills itself
as an electric auto lab

83
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,845
that will make all kinds
of custom vehicles,

84
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:54,619
including things like
delivery and garbage trucks.

85
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:56,282
Thor will have a hell of a time

86
00:03:56,282 --> 00:03:59,444
going up against giants
like Tesla and Daimler.

87
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:01,344
Since they have, you know,

88
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:04,011
actual factories and experience.

89
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:07,194
But LA has long been home to high risk

90
00:04:07,194 --> 00:04:09,543
custom auto projects.

91
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:11,483
Tesla's early operations didn't look

92
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,650
much different than these.

93
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:18,206
We set up prototyping
tools really early on,

94
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:20,110
because we realized that was a vital part

95
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,771
of being able to build quickly,

96
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:23,352
and produce something
that we could actually

97
00:04:23,352 --> 00:04:26,503
start demonstrating and
showing to customers.

98
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:28,362
This warehouse has been in Dakota's family

99
00:04:28,362 --> 00:04:30,497
for three generations.

100
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:32,633
First as a depot for making and selling

101
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:34,895
military grade electronics,

102
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,794
and then as a storage
spot for the family's

103
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:38,627
Malibu wines vineyard.

104
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:42,216
Dakota started working here when he was 7,

105
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,968
and eventually ran the
family wine business,

106
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:46,869
and started it's safari tours

107
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,337
so the Hollywood elite can get drunk

108
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:52,131
and hang out with giraffes.

109
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:54,556
There's tons of inspiration in this place.

110
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:57,022
Tucked in the corner is this beauty.

111
00:04:57,022 --> 00:05:00,466
This is a 1918 Walker Electric Panel Van.

112
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,058
This vehicle was fully electric,

113
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:04,561
a battery electric vehicle

114
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:06,385
from the early turn of the century.

115
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:08,247
What did they use it for?

116
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:09,080
Deliveries.

117
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,289
This was actually one of
like a milk delivery vehicle,

118
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:12,865
or an ice delivery vehicle.

119
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:15,566
So this would be a
range of about 15 miles.

120
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,499
12-15 miles.
Okay.

121
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:19,567
Everybody here is incredibly committed.

122
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,268
This isn't a project
that we're trying to do

123
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:23,253
or gain a bunch of notoriety.

124
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:25,767
We want to actually make
these things exist in fleets.

125
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:28,726
We're actually driven to
make this a viable business,

126
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:31,609
and not just a science project.

127
00:05:31,609 --> 00:05:33,149
And if things don't pan out,

128
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:35,483
Dakota can always hop in his RV,

129
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:36,699
hit the road,

130
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:39,872
and go soul searching
for his next venture.

131
00:05:39,872 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure this beast runs
great on electricity too.
