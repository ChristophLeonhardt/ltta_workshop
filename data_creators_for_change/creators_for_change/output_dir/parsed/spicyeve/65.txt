Uhh, in the comments below, tell me if my dimple is
coming through or nahh.
Tova said it was a shadow.
- It is a shadow.
How shady is that? But I think I have about 10 lbs
to gain before it's an actual, like true
true and true dimple.
But, that's not important.  Enjoy the video.
Hey YouTube world, it's me, Evelyn.
I'm coming to you
eyebrow-less
first and foremost.
Uhm...
Eyeliner-less, because the allergy count, fam,
in Central Texas y'all,
is...
ASTRONOMICAL.
I'm coming to you chapstick-less, to be quite honest.
I just hit a smooth , and that's all I did.
Like  and then I hopped on the camera.
This is basically an experiment to see if I spontaneously
combust because I don't have eyebrows on camera.
So, a lot of y'all say things like,
"Man, you could be talking about a wall and I'd listen."
That is so flattering, very unhelpful, but so flattering.
But that reminded me about the time that I actually
thought there was a ghost in my apartment,
because there was a handprint on my wall.
It was this wall right here.
I remember one day it was, you know, daylight
and I'm looking at the wall, and I'm like,
is that a handprint?
But the thing was, it wasn't like a palm down handprint,
it was just like fingertips, ya know what I mean?
I'm like, who...
Whose fingertips are those?
I literally go through
months, I go through my whole life,
thinking that there's a ghost.
And you know, I'm cool with it, nawwmsayin'?
As long...I even like walk around the house just making
declarations to the atmosphere like,
"Hey fam, what's good?
Don't need to see you, really don't need that.
Just letting you know that I don't want none.
You do you, and Imma do me."
My apartment is new. I was the first person to live
in this apartment, so you know what that means...
Whatever this apartment was built on
 is the culprit.
Friends would come over, I'd be like,
"Girl, look this handprint. I got a ghost."
It was just a fact of life.
I don't even try to like wash the handprint,
ya know what I'm saying?
You wanted it there, so it's gonna stay there.
I respect your wishes.
It's early or...late at night, early morning, whatever.
Pretty much know the geography of my room,
and of my apartment, so I don't open my eyes
to go to the bathroom. I mean I feel like that's a pretty
common thing.
I'm navigating and I'm walking, and I trip
because my room's dirty.
And?
To prevent myself from smashing into the wall
face first,
guess what I did?
Put up my hand,
UGGHH...
like this. Not like this, cause that would hurt my wrist
to just like smash my hand this way into the wall.
So I kinda did this.
 Oh...
I'm the ghosty!
I had been falling, or I had at least fallen once before,
fell onto the wall,
made the handprint myself.
First of all, what made the handprint?
Why are my fingers so greasy?
Lotion? I don't know.
In the comments below, lemme know if you actually
have any ghost stories.
And i'll see you, girl...
 whenever.
BYE!
