my husband was murdered and what they
classified the farm attack as a
journalist it's way too easy to isolate
yourself from a story
South Africa deserves better than this
lazy journalism I needed to see this
story up close in the last year they
were roughly 84 farm murders the stories
behind these statistics are horrifying
felony rate for the same wisdom and
fuckin special I hit the ground they
started eating me and said today we're
going to be really quite positive
who is behind these attacks if you want
to water your affiliate review or wanna
be realized in Brazil and Chile and
never be mature then be small one and if
you know you're being hunted
why stay we belong to each other and
reality if you wanna keep on forming
they can come and kill me but I won't
come South Africa's political class
would prefer you never hear my reporting
never hear the voices of victims and
survivors never hear how bad things are
for the white people of South Africa
well now you know
