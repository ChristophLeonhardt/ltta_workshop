I had a grade school teacher
tell me once:
"Whatever you do, 
do with your might.
Things done by halves are
never done right."
And I pretty much live by that.
I always wanted to be a cowboy.
And I decided I'm going
to build a Western town.
It's not an easy job
running a place like this.
You don't have much time for
yourself.
I don't work 24 hours a day,
but for an old man,
I put in a good
day's work.
Once you start something
like this and you see it grow
and you see the people that
come back year after year,
I think we're just trying
to preserve 
the memories of this,
you know.
Probably our biggest thought is
we don't want to sell this 
to anybody that's just going 
to come in here 
and sell everything off.
But, you can't stop anything.
But, I'lll still be here.
