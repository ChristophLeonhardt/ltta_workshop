pornstar stormy Daniels we'll have to wait a little longer for her day in court on Friday a federal judge granted a 90 day delay in her civil lawsuit against president Trump's longtime lawyer Michael Cohen citing a criminal investigation the attorney is facing Cohen asked for a delay after FBI agents raided his home and office earlier this month the judge said on Friday that the issues in stormy Daniels civil suit overlap with the criminal probe into Cohen meanwhile the National Enquirer is going after Michael Cullen on the cover of a new issue the publication's parent company American media incorporated is run by David pecker who is a friend of President Trump and some believe that the too often collude to get National Enquirer front-page stories that Trump wants so that's probably bad news for Michael Cohen joining us now a pair of former colleagues says federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York named Erica and Daniel Goldman Mimi and daniel co-write an op-ed for the hill entitled in the Cohen case don't buy the vast government conspiracy defense and in it they write this attorney Michael Cohen has not been charged with a crime but President Donald Trump and his defenders apparently are so concerned about what incriminating information Cohen may give to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York that they have begun a campaign to discredit the entire federal criminal justice system these attacks however distort how the system actually works do not understand scrutiny and come at the expense of public confidence in our criminal justice process to say at the least Mimi and then let alone Michael Cohen it appears as being a little bit hung out to dry absolutely and you know this is a common tactic that a defense attorneys savvy defense attorneys do in court when there's a trial and the evidence is strong they attack the credibility of co-operators the witnesses who have that very damaging evidence and it's one thing to do that in court when defense attorneys do it it's another thing for the president of the you know it states to be doing it you know he his surrogates are doing it as you pointed out the Enquirer alan dershowitz other people are doing it but the President of the United States he's head of the government that is this justice system and for his own personal reasons he's willing to just completely undermine the confidence and it's it's right now Daniel it's also though it's short-sighted because you've got a judge in Kimball woods and it says she has complete confidence in the integrity of the Southern District of New York the prosecutors and it mean that it's one thing if you're attacking Cohen and Rosen Stein sessions and the FBI here it's a little more closely held you got Kimball woods you got the prosecutors and you've got Donald Trump's are Cohen's defense team there's not a lot of wiggle room there all it seems to me all he's doing is making a federal judge angry which I by the way if I did that one was practicing in Northwest Florida which I would never do cuz federal judges scared the hell out of me I would be pissing off a federal judge you don't want to do that whether you're in Northwest Florida or whether you're in the Southern District of New York absolutely and it reflects a greater and deeper concern that has never existed certainly when we were there and we were there combined 26 years and it was never a situation where we ever felt like first of all that we were doing anything other than specifically what our job was and that was nonpartisan and that is literally to follow the evidence and figure it out and forbid what is the upside of making I mean maybe things have changed since I practiced law for like two weekends but what what is the upside of attacking the the judicial system and making a federal judge angry the only thing I can think of is it's a political play which is to say that and I'm not sure that Trump is thinking this far out but let's assume he is let's assume he's a rational actor for a moment and it's a political play which is where he's been advised that he's likely not going to get charged by either but as a sitting president right now and so what is gonna play out is there'll be a report and it will go to Congress and it'll be an impeachment issue for Congress to deal with at which point it turns political so he's trying to undermine the investigation he's trying to undermine the evidence and he's trying to provide his allies and surrogates in Congress with some political cover so that they have a basis on which to attack the information and the evidence that comes out that's there it's not a legal play because I don't see there's nothing lethal system is gonna play out I mean the theory being advanced by Alan Dershowitz the president's friend at Harvard is something like this so prosecutors would lie to the judge to get a search warrant get this evidence and then find terrible things and then threaten come with a life sentence kind of walk us through why this theory does not hold up in your view right and you both touched on this so it's I mean you really have to buy into this entire conspiracy theory it's not just Michael Cohen is a liar it's the prosecutors are evil and you know planting evidence did he do this with OJ 20 years ago yeah I mean it's consistent in that we're not saying prosecutorial overreach or misconduct never happens that would be extremely naive and and contrary to what's happened in the world but they're here saying it's happening already with no indication that it's happening and every indication to the contrary and it's not something that happens regularly so the prosecutors would have to be in on it the prosecutor the judge the agent as a matter of law can the prosecutors say this is the sentence no and absolutely there are so many safety checks built into the system and that's the point there they're just ignoring all of those so the judge decides the sentence the prosecutors don't decide a sentence so and in a white collar case in particular as we say me up at like the idea that that you could manufacture a story like this you know you'd have to have started it pretty much like ten years ago you'd have to have started planting the seeds for them and so it just it doesn't make sense and to take their theory to its logical conclusion it means really what they're saying is this happens in every case and or many cases so so we should basically let you know drug dealers gang violent gang members you know rapists we should let them all out of jail because clearly you know there's prosecutorial overreach everywhere and and this is a problem Daniels similarly when it came to the issue when it when and if it comes to the issue of trying to get Michael cone to cooperate presumably there also has to be substantiating evidence as well I mean prosecute is not going to go to Michael cone and say okay I'm gonna give you this deal based on your story they're gonna have a have a whole load of other evidence that they have as well in order to get to give him something in return for his cooperation that's right and this is where this theory really falls apart because even if you assume that the prosecutors are acting improperly and making threats and doing all sorts of improper things to convince Michael Cohen to cooperate there are so many checks and balances that happen after that fact so let's say in in this hypothetical theory that Michael Cohen just makes up a story because he's really innocent and everybody else is innocent in a in a case like this in a white-collar case you're gonna have contemporaneous emails you're gonna have bank records you're gonna have documents so in theory if they're in if they're innocent he's making up a story of guilt that it's gonna be inconsistent with all the innocent evidence that's why it doesn't happen and and from the process perspective we would never ever allow anyone to cooperate if we have not vetted their information and made sure that it's truthful not just that oh we believe it's truthful to see other evidence other witness testimony other documentary evidence that convinces us it's truthful and then once you have a cooperating witness who you believe you still would never charge anyone based solely on that cooperating witnesses testimony you have to have other corroborating evidence so there are so many different ways that the system ensures that the proper people are being charged and they have volume like you said of documentary evidence oh yeah it files like this there was already email search warrants on Michael Cole for this through the files and you can see it's gonna it's gonna be so obvious and also mica this whole conspiracy theory that anybody who believes that prosecutors in the Southern District of New York would go after the President of the United States attorney without having everything dead dissenter have no idea now that office or any other prosecutors I'm office works do you really want to be the person that screwed up on such a monumental basis on the national stage and destroy your
