I think if we move over to the chair she
might die and that's when I I realize
like she wasn't gonna make
I think she's gonna die anyway
and she just like turned to me and was
like hold me
like put her arms and legs around me in
her had kind of went back and she was
sort of like gasping to breathe and then
she
she said please help me feel better
