on Wednesday a far-left Bernie Sanders supporter who despised president Trump opened fire on Republican Congress people practicing for a bipartisan charity baseball game now we all know that if the situation had been reversed if a president Trump supporter and Bernie hater had opened fire on congressional Democrats we would be treated to the full spectacle of media foe outrage we get long-winded stem winders about Republicans creating a climate of hate and violence we'd receive stern talking-to about gun culture and polarizing rhetoric we know this because it's been a strategic mainstay for Democrats for half a century going all the way back to the left blaming the right for a climate of eight that supposedly led to JFK's assassination by a commie in 1963 the left is blame talk radio for the Oklahoma City bombing Sarah Palin and the right for the attempted assassination of Gabby Giffords by a mentally ill man by the way Bernie Sanders even attempted to raise money off that canard Confederate flag owners for a massacre at a historically black church and President Trump for a stabbing in Portland committed by a Bernie Sanders supporter but is it right to blame Sanders and leftist ideology more broadly for Wednesday's shooting no it isn't OK rhetoric is not directly responsible for violence unless it advocates violence radical jihadism advocates violence the bulk of its supporters know this and support violence a solid contingent of its followers participate in violence the same is not true for American brand political leftism as vile as it is for the right to equate verbiage with violence no matter how inflammatory the verbiage is to fall prey to the same snowflake syndrome the right condemns on college campuses there is no logical gap between attempting to blame right-wing speakers for supposed violent speech in opposing black lives matter and attempting to blame Sanders for the sins of a random follower this leaves two questions on the table first are we living through a more toxic political climate than ever before in American history promoting individual acts of violence among the mentally unstable and second are we in danger of blurring the lines between passionate rhetoric and actual advocacy toward violence well as far as the first question does the answers obviously no it would take really a lot of ignorance in American history to believe that our current political climate is worse than civil war-era America or even late 1960s America if only because our underlying problems are significantly less horrifying yes our political climate is toxic just yesterday Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe who attempted to blame gun control for the shooting suggested that the Trump campaign or someone associated with it had acted reasonably with regard to Russia the entire resistance is built on the rhetoric of a wartime underground by the same token the right has taken to using war language far more regularly even than it did in the Obama era we're told we're in a civil war that the media are enemies but here's the truth nobody took this stuff particularly seriously we can all tell the differences between rhetorical flourishes and violent advocacy except when we can't which brings us to the second question are we moving beyond purple language and into the realm of actual violent advocacy on both left and right the answer seems to be yes on the left thanks to politicians attempting to capitalize on public anger groups like Ann Tifa run free in major American cities acts of violence against Trump supporters are brushed off are treated by the media as he said she said situations on the right too many Republicans ignore or downplay incidents like the Greg Jean Forte incident in Montana or then-candidate Trump's talk about people paying their bills if they assaulted protesters there are two ways to deal with the problem first we have to establish a bright-line rule no defending or advocating violence period end of story second we should all probably take a deep breath before we hit Send it's not our fault if fringe characters take advantage of our language to do violence we never suggested and don't support but let's all do our best and yes I'm including myself here to use language we can defend morally that doesn't mean tamping down our passion with regard to politics it does mean thinking twice before hitting sends on a tweet or Facebook post comparing Republicans to Isis thanks to their health care policy or suggesting the Democrats are eager to watch Americans die in a fiery incident in terrorist incidents because they oppose president Trump's travel ban perhaps the language of civil war is perfectly appropriate we're willing to stand by it so be it but let's think it through this seems like a decent thing to do if we wish to preserve some semblance of a social fabric i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show so in the aftermath of yesterday's horrific congressional shooting and all prayers for Steve Scalise the House Majority Whip who apparently is still in critical condition was undergoing surgery all throughout the night and everybody should take a moment today and just say a prayer for congressman Scalise but in the aftermath of that there have been a bunch of reactions that are quite fascinating it seems like we are now on the verge of going too far in the other direction what I mean by that is that if we were on the verge of going too far in the everyone is angry let's shout at each other and hit each other with six direction now it seems like we're in danger of going too far along me everybody just needs to never say anything that could offend anyone and I want to be careful about what we say are the kinds of speech that are appropriate and talking about people on the right and the left I want to be careful and go through what kinds of speech I think are really damaging and dangerous and which kinds of speech are just typical political rhetoric because this is the sort of situation where people could say okay a nutcase went crazy and shot a bunch of people let's all get rid of all offensive rhetoric let's get back to this kind of faux civility we'll never say anything inflammatory we'll never say anything interesting will never use language that is evocative we all have to check ourselves all the time at the door I want to go through it I think there are three different types of language and I want to go through those in a second and discuss which ones are acceptable which ones are not obviously none of this should be regulated but which ones are acceptable and which ones are not in sort of everyday use because I'm a little bit frightened that the Sanofi lake syndrome that now attends to college campuses is being picked up by the right in response to the left and left always says people like me speaking on college campuses well that creates a climate of violence and people are gonna get hurt so we have to shut down Shapiro I don't want to see the same thing happen on the right with regard to people on the left us saying well you know when when they say the Trump is unamerican or when they say Trump is a tyrants that's just bad and it gets people killed I don't want to do that because again I like having the same moral standard for everyone so I'm gonna talk about that in just a second but before I get to that I first want to say thank you to our advertisers over at wink so you don't know anything about wine but you have a dinner party tonight and you don't know which one to bring this is why you need to go over to wink calm try wink calm slash battement try winc dot-com / man what they do is they have a quick algorithm you fill it out it tells you you put in sort of your tastes what what

sent you and also you see get that $20 off your first your first buy plus complimentary shipping so very cool ok so in the aftermath of the attack yesterday there was this brief moment where everybody came together and everybody does this every so often after Gabby Giffords there was a 48-hour period where people were nice to each other after 9/11 there was a probably four month period where everybody was really nice to each other yesterday it was about a six hour period so the amount of time will nice to each other after a horrific incident that that really goes to the heart of America has now been reduced to less than the amount of time that it takes for a yoghurt to spoil if you leave it out of the refrigerator but yesterday people said the right things in the immediate aftermath of the attack here with Bernie Sanders it was more remember one of his volunteers who went out and shot somebody the shooter was a Sanders supporting Trump hating leftist maniac and he specifically targeted congressional Republicans if there hadn't been heroes on the ground there - / - in particular to put this guy down probably 15 to 20 congressmen are dead today here's Bernie Sanders talking about how horrified he was to learn there was one of his volunteers I have just been informed that the alleged shooter at the Republican baseball practice this morning is someone who apparently volunteered on my presidential campaign I am sickened by this despicable act and let me be as clear as I can be violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemned this action in the strongest possible terms real change can only come about through non-violent action and anything else runs counter to our most deeply held American values I know I speak for the entire country in saying that my hopes and prayers are that representative Scalise congressional staff and the Capitol police officers who were wounded make a quick and full recovery I also want to thank the Capitol police for their heroic actions to prevent further harm okay so there's Bernie Sanders saying exactly the right thing obviously violent activity needs to be put aside we talk in a minute about whether the left is indeed putting aside violent rhetoric and violent activity because I think the answer is in large measure no but Sanders has actually been pretty consistent on this point right he was one of the guys who said that the riots at Berkeley when he innopolis went to Berkeley he said that those riots were wrong he said that Ann Coulter should speak at Berkeley and shouldn't be shut down so I can't blame Bernie Sanders per se for this I know a lot of people are trying to because Bernice and they're trying to hold burning it to his own standard now back in 2011 Sanders fundraised off of the idea that Gabby Giffords was shot because Sarah Palin put some sort of targeting districts map on her on her Facebook page there was no link whatsoever between Palin and the shooter Sanders raised money off of it anyway so if you're gonna hold the left to their own standards if we're gonna say that toxic rhetoric causes incidents like this then you have to hold Bernie responsible but I'm not Bernie I thought it was wrong when Bernie did it and so I'm not going to be Bernie now and say that it's that it's Bernie's fault Paul Ryan I thought had a great response yesterday also here's what he had to say on the floor of Congress there are very strong emotions throughout this house today we are all horrified by this dreadful attack on our friends and on our colleagues and those who serve and protect this capital we are all praying for those who are attacked and for their families Steve Scalise Zachary Barth Matt Micah Special Agent David Bailey special agent Krystal Greiner we are all giving our thoughts to those currently being treated for their injuries at this moment and we are united we are united in our shock we are united in our anguish an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us okay so Paul Ryan of course saying the right things is well Nancy Pelosi the House Minority Leader she said much the same thing she said she was praying for Scalise and Trump and then she of course came out immediately today and said the climate of toxic political rhetoric in the country is the fault of Republicans so that lasted for five entire seconds now I want to go through I think some of the some of the types of speech that are out there and whether we should hold them responsible for violence John Nolte I thought had a really great piece over at Daily wire today Nolte is is a firebrand for sure and notes he got a piece today talking about the case basically that CNN is responsible for this by CNN's own standard and that's basically correct CNN has said over and over and over that it was it was the Confederate flag that caused the shooting down to historically black church in Charleston they said that it was the pizza gate conspiracy the cause pizza gay guy to go and shoot up a restaurant they said that it was Sarah Palin responsible for Gabby Giffords all of it and then they go out there and they say that the Shakespeare and the park assassination of Trump thing is awesome they hire Kathy Griffin and then reluctantly fired Kathy Griffin they CNN makes comments all the time about how I mean they tried to connect Steve Scalise this congressman to the KKK yeah all of this is is it goes to the hypocrisy of the left and I think that it demonstrates the left is rightly getting batted around for this today it demonstrates that the right shoe not make them say mistake we should not make the same mistake where we say okay political rhetoric is connected to individual actions because the next time some kook happens to have listen to Rush Limbaugh at any point and then goes and shoot somebody the entire left is gonna say well it's Rush Limbaugh's fault you know this guy who shot up the Congress people he was a big Rachel Maddow found is that Rachel Maddow is fault no I don't think that it's Rachel Maddow is fault so there are three there there are three sorts of speech that I think are worthwhile considering and and I think that we need to be exact in how we do this because I sort of argued it vaguely yesterday but I didn't think that was exact enough so here there are three types of speech that are worth considering that's whether they cross online or not whether we also think twice before using them and two of them I think that they do cross the line and they are becoming more and more prevalent so number one speech that actively advocates violence so it's actually illegal to tell people go hit that guy right you're not actually allowed to say that in the United States but there's something that sort of borders on it which is violence is kind of great you should go do it not like a specific direction that you should do violence to any one person but a generalized notion that you should go to violence to people generally jesse ben is a columnist for The Huffington Post and he wrote that a violent response to Trump would be quote as logical as any he wrote that last week in the Huffington Post he has a he has a cartoon on the Todd's pinned on top of his Twitter feed that shows the it shows Pepe the Frog being literally beheaded and then there's a swastika on Hamra so there is this this element of the left that actually is good with violence and advocates for violence and makes room for violence you see it more broadly on the left when it comes to people like Maxine Waters who had said that the LA riots were in LA uprising or Marilyn Mosby in or rather not Marilyn Mosby the mayor of Baltimore who had said that she was Stephanie rawlings-blake who had said that she had made room for rioters in Baltimore when things went bad or even President Obama sort of incentivizing rioters in Ferguson you know that sort of stuff is really dangerous and there is a link between that sort of rhetoric and violence when an Tifa pushes actual violence at Berkeley we're in that category and yes when President Trump says or when he was then candidate Trump when he says he's gonna pay the legal bills of people who punch other people were in that category that sort of stuff is dangerous sort of stuff is linked to violence people who actively advocate violence are part of the problem okay category number two people who defend violence so this is slightly bigger okay this is a bigger group of people very small group of people who actively advocate violence then there are people who defend violence and that is on the Left everybody at the Middlebury University administration who said it was okay for people to assault to protest it to assault assault a professor at the charles murray event these are the the mayor of Berkeley who allows hands he fur to run roughshod through the city and hit people and assault people and then says we can't do anything about it it's the the administrators of a Cal State LA who told the police to basically stand down so students could hurt other students who are trying to hear a lecture that I was giving it's also true people who are defending outright Greg Jian Forte the Montana congressional candidate are making white from body slamming reporter okay when you defend violence you're part of the problem you are contributing to a greater violent a greater violent climate in the country there's a third type of rhetoric however that I want to be very careful about because I think that we are now in danger of falling into the snowflake trap which I'll describe in just a second but before I get to that I wanna say thank you to our sponsors over at blankets so you don't have a lot of time to gather information I sit around reading books all day I have a career that allows me to do that most people don't most people you're in the car you got 15 minutes what sort of information can you grab outside of the ben shapiro show that's where blinka scums in so blink astiz an app that essentially summarizes the main points of all these books that you definitely want which is awesome because even if you read a 400 page book the amount to take away that you're gonna get from that might just fit into 15 minutes what blankets does is they summarize the key points of books and then they allow you to take those in so if you have an hour drive you can basically read four books in one day if 2,000 of the best-selling non-fiction books transforms in these powerful packs that they call blinks you can read or listen to in just 15 minutes books like why nations fail 500 page book great book I've read the entire book but do I remember more than 15 minutes of content from it probably not blankets you go there and you listen to the summary of the book and suddenly you know as much about that book as I probably do even though I actually sat there for hours and hours reading the book and this is true for a wide variety of books and it's got fields ranging from productivity to business science to history to self-improvement fantastic fantastic app I love it it's blankets BL i NK is T Bo I NK is t-dot-com / been if you want to go over there right now and you go to blink is calm / been and that allows you to get a three month period for free when you get a yearly subscription or a free trial period right now so you can give it a listen you get that free trial or three months off your yearly plan when you join tonight's blink is calm / been awesome service I use it myself very cool okay so I've discussed the first two types of rhetoric that I think are off limits or should be off limits that doesn't mean you legal but it does mean that people of good conscience should not use them then there is the third group and this is where I see the right starting to make a mistake there's this third part of speech where people on the right are beginning to veer off into snowflake land and I'll give you an example so representative Jack Burkman Republican he comes down he blames the media he was at this this shooting he blamed the media for complicity in the attack here's what he had to say do you agree with that do you think that the hateful rhetoric has gotten just too high no how I agree yeah I agree with I agree with Rodney wholeheartedly in that the hateful rhetoric serves no positive purpose in fact today and obviously served a negative purpose but unfortunately and I'm looking at all of the media in the eye when I say this friendships and cordial relationships don't make good news so I can tell you especially is the president of the freshman class Republicans we are united along with our Democratic freshman counterparts to bring civility back to the hundred and fifteen Congress say okay that's not wonderful that's all good but the idea the media is to blame here I think is over the top and I'll explain why in a sec eric bolling on fox news who's used some colorful language in his time he said sort of the same thing he said how many innocents have to die before we realize that words matter spill blood die really ma'am soup dogs gun Kathy Griffin's head shakespeare's bloody rampage it goes on and on how many innocent people have to die before we realize that words do matter crazy people act on the crazy things they hear from politicians and celebrities think before you utter those blind hateful words next time liberals because there are crazy people out there taking your metaphors literally before your liberals blow a gasket saying I'm being partisan I will tell you I will guarantee you this I would be writing the same monologue and delivering the same monologue if it were a Democrat softball practice targeted and terrorized that I promise you okay maybe maybe not mark Stein says sort of the same thing he says the big problem here is the left once did he humanize their political opponents the left wants to denormalize and dehumanize to use your words its political opposition and they do that in a variety of ways so for example when charles murray wants to give a speech at Middlebury College they have to have a riot they don't have a debate in which they demolish his argument they don't want to win the debate they want to prevent the debate taking place okay and I think that that's a good example but where I see this going off the rails I don't think bowling or Stein say anything deeply wrong there in the examples they use are from the first two categories of speech but what I do see is a lot of people today saying things like well you know the resistance and Coulter's acollins nations the resistance finally goes live fire okay we called ourselves the Tea Party the Tea Party if you recall was actually a resistance movement to the government okay that didn't was not averse to using it was not averse to using violence back in the day I mean the tea party ended up becoming the American Revolution the idea that if you use rhetoric that is charged that this is the same thing as using rhetoric that defends violence or advocates violence I think is a dangerous precedent that we are setting and I can see it being flipped very very easily I don't see in an a problem with saying that a president is acting tyrannical I don't think that's calling for the president to be assassinated I don't think the vast majority of Americans think that's calling for the president to be assassinated when people call themselves the Tea Party or the resistance I don't think just because you say you're a member of the resistance that means that you're like a member of the French Resistance and you're gonna go out there and start shooting Republicans you know when when people who are pro-life talk about the killing of babies in the womb I don't think that's an implicit call to murder abortionists I don't and the vast majority of pro-life people I mean virtually all of them know that right and the same is true on the left when they say that on the left that Republicans want to kill granny that they're the murderers and like Isis because of trumps health care plan so I think that's stupid yeah I think it's ridiculous and stupid do I also think that it's causing violence not really I mean it you know when I wrote the book bullies which is the New York Times bestseller and bullies is all about the left's attempt to demonize us to attack us on a character level for our political views and I said this is morally wrong it is morally wrong but it is not necessarily connected with violence so the left is constantly attempting to say everybody's a racist sexist pig and homophobe that doesn't necessarily mean that they want everybody to be killed and well I think to the language on the grounds that you should have evidence for the assertions that you put forth I think there's a bigger risk right now that in a climate like this people are going to immediately start saying well you're not allowed to say charged things because if you say charged things that means some crazies gonna go off if we judge the value of political rhetoric by the crazy who goes off there's not going to be a lot of political rhetoric left if we're gonna play this game where some nutcase shoots up congressional staffers and shoots up a congressman and he watches Rachel Maddow so we blame Rachel Maddow then we can't be surprised when the left turns around they already do this cuz they're because they're awful we can't be surprised when the left turns around and says well it's sean hannity's fault if somebody goes nuts and shoots up a Democratic Congress office you know the left does it anyway so I understand the temptation is this turnabout is fair play temptation that doesn't mean that it's right so I think that we have to be careful about this routine now on that last point as far as demonization and demonizing your political opposition last point here I think that it's a gray area so I think someone's humanization is okay some demonization is not okay some demonization is sort of acceptable what is not acceptable is demonization combined with defensive violence or advocacy of violence so if you demonize your political opponent then you say oh yeah and by the way if you punch somebody in the face that's okay right if you say my opponents a Nazi I think that's basically you may be wrong you may be stupid what you're saying may be dumb but I don't think that it's linked to violence if you say my opponent is a Nazi and it's okay to punch Nazis I think that you start to get into really morally dicey territory so I wanted to make those distinctions because I don't want a standard set whereby anything political anybody says we're going to now judge the value of that polity based on the outlier who is vulnerable to suggestion and then goes out and shoots people I just think that's a dangerous thing okay well as we continue here on the bench Shapiro show we're gonna be talking about President Trump and what he says is a witch-hunt against him this obstruction of justice news Washington Post breaks last night that robert muller who is the the special counsel is now investigating trump for obstruction of
