Syrian government forces are pushing
ISIL to the western outskirts of deir
resort and with 90 percent of the
province now liberated civilians are
starting to move back in Islamic state
fighters made kids take their jeans off
to punish them if they caught them
wearing them it was a complete
discrimination we are third grade for
them even the bread we ate was third
class militants used to drink the water
in bottles and we were allowed to drink
running water only
this is my neighborhood my home all the
houses here like my own who lived all
over this area we've come here as
liberators of our city of deers or of
our houses and of our families from ISIL
terrorists and militants
