now Mark Halperin is a guy that I have honestly some disdain for to say the least go back and watch some old clips he is to me the epitome of conventional wisdom and the establishment media you know some conservatives might think oh it's a media figure on TV you must be liberal it dawned on me a couple of years ago he's so precious there's no person on television that reinforces right-wing Republican talking points more than Mark Halperin and it dawned on me a couple of years ago that it was like oh maybe it's just the Republican you know there's that possibility so whatever he is and I don't know and I don't really care he will tell you that war is great and then we need tax cuts for the rich and then any progressive idea has no chance of ever being accomplished its conventional wisdom 101 and it's almost not his fault he's just the creation of Washington and so that's the situation that Mark Halperin was in and that's why I had no love for bonk alprin but today's news about Mark Halperin is sadder it is about unfortunately sexual harassment charges so let me tell you what those are so that you could see what's going on and it has cost them a job already so CNN broke this story and hey you know sometimes I get on CNN for not breaking stories but they did break this one so credit to them veteran journalist Mark Halperin sexually harassed women while he was in a powerful position at ABC News according to five women who shared their previously undisclosed accounts with CNN and others who did not experience the alleged harassment personally but were aware of it so that corroboration is important I'm gonna have a quote on that for you and a little bit as well so five women that's a lot and so this story could have complications and I will get to that as we keep telling you more about it but at them it does not end well the stories of harassment shared with CNN range in nature from propositioning employees for sex to kissing and grabbing one's breasts against her will three of the women who spoke to CNN described Halper as without consent pressing an erection against their bodies while he was clothed that's terrible now he denies that part of the charge but admits that he did do something I'll get to his quote in a second but to be clear Oliver Darcy for CNN reports Halperin denies grabbing a woman's breasts and impressing his general is against the three women CNN also reports the women who worked with Halperin and who spoke with CNN did not report to Halperin however Halperin made many decisions about political coverage at ABC News and had a voice to some critical personnel decisions none of the women have said though that he ever promised anything exchanged for sex or suggested that he would retaliate against anyone so I read that and I thought look he's denying the non-consensual stuff well this and asking people out that's a more of a gray area that I'll get to in a second and and he did not necessarily hold power over them so that makes it different than Harvey Weinstein or Roger Ailes or Bill O'Reilly so let's withhold judgment for a second and I'm thinking this as I'm reading through the story and then they we get to Mark Halperin statement during the this period he said I did pursue a relationship with women that I worked with including some junior to me I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain for that I am deeply sorry and I apologize under the circumstances I'm going to take a step back from my day to day work while I properly deal with this situation you guys might not know this but because of the nature of me running the company I've had all these seminars right and and so they explained and I was actually surprised by this I got this about a year ago you now cannot criticize employees for dating each other so the rules have changed a little bit and it depends on which state you are etc don't take your counsel from me but so there as I'm reading this story I said okay now let's really withhold judgment here it depends on the context of his relationship with those folks if he asked someone out and they said yes that actually would be perfectly acceptable and I'm trying really hard not to hold my bias against them on policy issues etc away from the story so that I don't prejudge it right so now and by the way if you ask someone out and they say no and you leave it at that that's also ok it's a little uncomfortable so you have to be really careful at work and I don't really suggest that I definitely don't suggest it but it does happen from time to time and and just whether the punishment of the person should not depend on whether the woman involved said yes or no to their simple request for a date so if that's what this was well he could certainly recover from that I think but then I read more and realized the long vague that's what this was so from another piece of reporting here away from the CNN story after the CNN story broke Clarissa Ward another reporter that worked at ABC tweeted this was an open secret when I was at ABC for years brave of these women to speak up oh so it looks like it wasn't just you know simply asking people out innocently then I you read the details going back to the CNN story and the details are not good so the first woman told CNN that she was invited to visit his office in the early 2000s when he was a political director at ABC News to have a soda and said that while she was there with him he forcibly kissed her and pressed his genitals against her body know that if true that is completely and utterly unacceptable I mean there's three different parts of that that are running civil first of all don't in but if you are someone who has a higher position at the company don't invite someone else who thinks well he maybe he could help me down the road don't invite a first soda and they you guys have not had any other interaction there's been nothing else and all of a sudden you know you're trying to force yourself on her oh that's terrible terrible and then kissing her without her permission what are you nuts and at work and she works you know under you in the the chain at a ABC let alone once you get to the genitals against the body that okay here's the quote from non named woman I went up to abba soda and and he just kissed me and grabbed my boobs I just froze I didn't know what to do who does that who does that apparently unfortunately a lot of people and a lot of men in power I just I'm blown away by it I can't imagine like oh hey how you doing and then BOOM you grab their breasts that's insane that's insane but apparently it was done with great frequency some version of that as we're seeing with all these stories okay CNN continues wish she did make her way out of his office the woman told a friend at ABC News what had happened the friend told CNN she remembered the woman telling her about the incident and seeing her visibly shaken so throughout the CNN article I'm actually not giving you all the details because I don't want to you know beat it into the ground and it just gets gross after a while and but there is several corroborating witnesses so it's not just Halperin's word against one person or even against five people there are also people at the time who said yeah I saw her come out of the office and she was shaken and she told me what happened at the time not now okay just last couple of quotes here so you get the full context the unnamed woman also said the first meeting and this another person the first meeting I ever had with him was in his office and he just came up from behind I was sitting in a chair from across his desk and he came up behind me and while he was clothed he pressed his body on mine his penis on my shoulder I was obviously completely shocked I can't even remember how I got out of there but I got out of there and was freaked out by that whole experience given I was so young and knew I wasn't sure if that was the sort of thing that was expected of you if you wanted something from a male figure in news that actually was the most devastating quote to me not because of the weird penis the shoulder thing which I've never heard of before but because of how it made her feel the abuse of power where you know you've I'm not going to try to court this person I'm not going to try to get their consent I'm going to use my power and the younger they are the or they don't know the ropes and then how many women whether it's through Halpern or other people thought is this the rules of the game it's I mean I don't want to play this game so in order to work and in order advance do I have to do something gross with a guy well I'm not gonna do that and how many of them we don't know about that then stop doing that job or didn't go up the ladder I mean this is devastating for women on a macro scale and we had no idea of the or at least I didn't and a lot of us didn't the the magnitude of the problem that we are now seeing being uncovered in front of our eyes now MSNBC where he was a regular on a or contributor mainly on Morning Joe said Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood so that leaves us some opening that he could come back now he's a guy that is beloved by the mainstream media and the establishment he had a book about the campaign his game change he that was turned into an HBO show he had a show on Showtime he got a he was at ABC everybody read the note which is the Morning Edition of the news that he put out and that's why he was so influential he made an and broke careers in a lot of ways whether you got featured a note or you didn't he went on to work in many different parts of the media he got a million-dollar contract reportedly from Bloomberg so all these different news organizations if Mark Halperin walked in they were like yes mr. conventional wisdom we love it super respected not necessarily by us and the internet progressives and young people but the establishment love this guy so my guess is they're gonna give him every opportunity to rehabilitate himself and he will go through all the different rigmarole that they do and if anyone has a chance at a comeback given how much those folks on TV like Halpern probably Halpern has the best chance of a comeback but the details are deeply disturbing and I'm not sure that uh that they merit that look I being a progressive I never want to rule out second chance for people but the recognition that you know those women thought their career might have been in jeopardy and what in the non-consensual part of this the fact that recognition has to be so thorough so convincing because how can you make sure that he goes back and works with other women and is not going to do the same things and it's a lot of thing against mark halperin and I and I would hold all judgment on whether he can rehabilitate himself like that but we see what the ales and the Weinsteins and the O'Reilly it is usually behavior that is repeated over and over and over again but last piece of just to be fair to to Halpern this was in the 1990s it doesn't make it any better at all it's just that there is no reported similar behavior in the last decade or so there's some in the early to late 90 min 90s late 90s I think early 2000s but not anything for the last 10 years so unlike those other characters he might not have repeated it I am trying to be over-the-top fair to him and I'm not quite sure why but the these details are really really bad but the most important part of all this is I think that we're all learning how much women have suffered in the workplace unfortunately quietly so in most of the instances and I think the spotlight on this putting aside people like Halpern and the rest for women overall is a cite anything it is a great tipping point where we put a spot line in and begin to turn the corner and hopefully not have this happen at the scale that it was happening before hopefully we wipe it out completely but that'll obviously take some time but for all the guys out there who are thinking of abusing their power or some rare cases women that might do likewise well you better be careful because you might be next in terms of the spotlight so that's a great thing because we don't want them victimizing any more people watch the young turks commercial-free downloaded a stream it watch it any way you like at TYT Network comm slash join
