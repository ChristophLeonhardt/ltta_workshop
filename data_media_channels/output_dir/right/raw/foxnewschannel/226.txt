1
00:00:00,569 --> 00:00:01,802
GOING TO TRY TO EXPLAIN IT.

2
00:00:01,803 --> 00:00:03,070
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.

3
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:04,872
WE ARE NOT OVERSTATING IT.

4
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:08,376
FIRST, KANYE WEST SPOKE AT THE

5
00:00:08,377 --> 00:00:09,877
WHITE HOUSE AND DREW NEWS

6
00:00:09,878 --> 00:00:12,280
COVERAGE FOR WHAT HE SAID.

7
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:13,781
COMMENTATORS WERE NOT IMPRESS

8
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:15,816
AND MANY DISMISSED IT AS A

9
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:16,284
SIDE SHOW.

10
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:17,685
IN SOME WAYS THEY WERE RIGHT.

11
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:18,786
HE MADE A NUMBER OF

12
00:00:18,787 --> 00:00:19,954
INTERESTING POINTS BUT IN THE

13
00:00:19,955 --> 00:00:22,189
END HE IS AN ENTERTAINER.

14
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,492
DONALD TRUMP WAS THERE, TOO.

15
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:25,593
HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE

16
00:00:25,594 --> 00:00:26,727
UNITED STATES, THE MOST

17
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:27,695
POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD.

18
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:29,130
LIKE THE REST OF US ULTIMATELY

19
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:35,069
HE IS PASSING THROUGH.

20
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,304
THERE WILL BE OTHER

21
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:36,704
PRESIDENTS.

22
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:37,805
THE QUESTION TO CARE ABOUT IS

23
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:38,806
BIGGER THAN TWO PEOPLE.

24
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:42,076
IS AMERICA STILL A FREE

25
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:42,410
COUNTRY?

26
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:43,811
CAN PEOPLE OPENLY EXPRESS

27
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:44,812
BELIEFS IN PUBLIC?

28
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:46,314
ARE THEY STILL ALLOWED TO SAY

29
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:47,715
WHAT THEY THINK IS TRUE

30
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:49,283
WITHOUT BEING PUNISHED FOR IT?

31
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:51,185
THAT IS WHAT MATTERS MOST AND

32
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:52,486
MATTERS MORE THAN ANY SINGLE

33
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:53,788
POLITICIAN OR RAPPER OR

34
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,090
MIDTERM ELECTION.

35
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:58,392
BY THAT STANDARD THE ONE THAT

36
00:00:58,393 --> 00:00:58,993
MATTERS WHAT HAPPENED

37
00:00:58,994 --> 00:00:59,827
YESTERDAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE

38
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:01,028
TELLS US A LOT ABOUT AMERICA

39
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,529
RIGHT NOW.

40
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,530
MUCH OF IT OMINOUS.

41
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:04,532
IF YOU MISSED IT, HERE IS PART

42
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:08,803
OF WHAT KANYE WEST SAID.

43
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:09,870
>> PEOPLE EXPECT IF YOU ARE

44
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:17,244
BLACK YOU HAVE TO BE DEMOCRAT.

45
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,513
I HAVE CONVERSATIONS THAT

46
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:20,681
WELFARE IS WHY BLACK PEOPLE

47
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:21,415
ARE DEMOCRATS.

48
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:24,785
FIRST, LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF

49
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:25,119
JOBS.

50
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,621
SO THE FATHERS LOSE JOB AND WE

51
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:29,724
WILL GIVE YOU MORE FOR HAVING

52
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:31,759
MORE KIDS IN YOUR HOME.

53
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,428
>> Tucker: TO SUM UP, KANYE

54
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:35,663
WEST SAYS THAT THE LIBERAL

55
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:36,897
SOCIAL PROGRAMS UNDERMUNE THE

56
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:37,798
BLACK FAMILY.

57
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,300
HE NOTES THAT THE

58
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,301
AFRICAN-AMERICANS FACE

59
00:01:40,302 --> 00:01:42,103
ENORMOUS PRESSURE NOT TO

60
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:43,104
SUPPORT REPUBLICANS.

61
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:44,338
HE SUGGESTED THAT THE

62
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:46,407
DEMOCRATIC PARTY OFTEN

63
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:47,908
DISPLAYS UNDISGUISED CONTEMPT

64
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,445
FOR MEN AND MASCULINITY.

65
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:54,015
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,ITE

66
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:56,484
KNOWS ESPECIALLY CONTROVERSIAL

67
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:56,884
STATEMENTS.

68
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:58,152
THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY TRUE FOR

69
00:01:58,153 --> 00:01:58,586
ONE THING.

70
00:01:58,587 --> 00:02:00,454
IF YOU PAY ANY ATTENTION AT

71
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:01,422
ALL YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT.

72
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:03,290
WHAT WEST SAID IS HARD TO

73
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,225
REBUT FACTUALLY THAT NOBODY

74
00:02:04,226 --> 00:02:05,493
TRIED TO DO THAT.

75
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:07,495
INSTEAD THEY ATTACKED HIM AS A

76
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:07,828
PERSON.

77
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,897
ATTACKED HIS DECENCY AND HIS

78
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:10,398
MENTAL CONDITION.

79
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,033
IF THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR, IT'S

80
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:13,601
BECAUSE THIS IS NOW A

81
00:02:13,602 --> 00:02:19,807
UNIVERSAL TACTIC ON THE LEFT.

82
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:20,975
THEY DON'T WANT TO ARGUE WITH

83
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:21,342
YOU.

84
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:22,710
THEY WANT TO DENOUNCE YOU.

85
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:25,513
WATCH THIS CNN DEEP CRITIQUE

86
00:02:25,514 --> 00:02:28,082
OF TRUMP'S DOMESTIC PROGRAM.

87
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,216
>> WHY DOESN'T PRESIDENT TRUMP

88
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:30,117
CONDEMN RACISM?

89
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:31,452
HIS OWN WORDS AND ACTION TELL

90
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:32,286
YOU WHY.

91
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:33,320
HE IS RACIST.

92
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:36,991
LET ME NOT MINCE WORDS.

93
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:40,127
THIS PRESIDENT TRAFFICS IN

94
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:42,096
RACIST.

95
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:44,031
ROSEANN'S TWEET WAS RACIST BUT

96
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:45,366
HE FAILED TO CONDEMN IT.

97
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:45,733
WHY?

98
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:46,834
HE CAN'T.

99
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:48,602
HIS OWN WORDS AND ACTIONS ARE

100
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:49,603
RACIST, TOO.

101
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:50,838
WE HAVE TO STOP PRETENDING

102
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,939
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING

103
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,409
TO DO WITH IT, THAT HE IS NOT

104
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,811
EMBOLDENING RACISTS AND

105
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:57,278
RACISM.

106
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,012
>> Tucker: THE BEST THING

107
00:02:58,013 --> 00:02:59,013
ABOUT THE ARGUMENT IS YOU

108
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:01,615
DON'T HAVE TO LEARN ANYTHING.

109
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,184
MASTER ANY DETAILS BECAUSE

110
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:04,618
FACTS ARE IRRELEVANT.

111
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,387
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS MY

112
00:03:06,388 --> 00:03:08,122
OPPONENTS ARE BAD PEOPLE.

113
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:10,324
YOU MUST IGNORE THEM.

114
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:11,759
SO IT WASN'T OBVIOUS HOW THE

115
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,260
LEFT WAS GOING TO PULL ANY OF

116
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,229
THIS ALL WITH KANYE WEST.

117
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,131
THEY ATTACKED HIM AS CRAZY AT

118
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:18,165
FIRST BUT IT DIDN'T MAKE

119
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:18,532
SENSE.

120
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,734
IF YOU THINK THAT KANYE WEST

121
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:22,803
IS MENTALLY HILL WHY ARE YOU

122
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:23,938
ATTACKING HIM FOR THAT?

123
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:26,006
YOU CAN'T CALL HIM RACE

124
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:27,141
U.S. BECAUSE HE IS BLACK --

125
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:29,110
RACIST BECAUSE HE IS BLACK.

126
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:30,611
BUT THEN THEY CRACK THE CODE.

127
00:03:30,612 --> 00:03:34,115
YOU MUST IGNORE KANYE WEST, HE

128
00:03:34,116 --> 00:03:35,382
EXPLAINS TO THE REST OF US

129
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:37,518
BECAUSE HE IS A TRAITOR TO HIS

130
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:37,818
RACE.

131
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:38,886
WATCH THIS.

132
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:41,088
>> WHAT I SAW WAS A MENTAL

133
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:41,856
SHOW TODAY.

134
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:43,724
HIM IN FRONT OF THE WHITE

135
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,693
PEOPLE, MOSTLY WHITE PEOPLE

136
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:47,995
EMBARRASSING HIMSELF.

137
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:49,196
EMBARRASSING AMERICANS BUT

138
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:50,331
MOSTLY AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

139
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:52,933
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN HE IS THE

140
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,935
PERSON WHO REPRESENTS THE

141
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:55,636
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY?

142
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:56,537
HE DOESN'T.

143
00:03:56,538 --> 00:03:59,740
THIS WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT.

144
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,208
HIS MOTHER IS ROLLING OVER IN

145
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:02,376
HER GRAVE.

146
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:04,612
>> Tucker: THERE YOU GO.

147
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:06,147
THAT HIS SKIN COLOR MEANS HE

148
00:04:06,148 --> 00:04:07,748
IS REQUIRED TO BEHAVE IN A

149
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:09,250
VERY SPECIFIC WAY.

150
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,352
IF HE CHOOSES TO BEHAVE IN ANY

151
00:04:11,353 --> 00:04:12,987
OTHER WAY HE SHOULD BE

152
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:13,354
PUNISHED.

153
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:16,924
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO DON

154
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,459
LEMON, HIS RACE IS HIS DESTINY

155
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,893
AND IT DEFINES EVERYTHING

156
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:20,693
ABOUT HIM.

157
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:21,929
PEOPLE USED TO TALK LIKE THIS

158
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,832
50 YEARS AGO AS THEY DEFENDED

159
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:25,900
RACIAL SEGREGATION OF THE

160
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:26,500
AMERICAN SOUTH.

161
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,968
WHAT A SURPRISE TO LEARN THEY

162
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:29,236
ARE STILL TALKING THAT WAY.

163
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:31,705
THIS TIME IT'S ON CNN.

164
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,607
MICHAEL ERIC DIESON WENT EVEN

165
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:33,941
FURTHER.

166
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:35,242
FOR THE CRIME OF BEING

167
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:37,044
FRIENDLY WITH A POLITICIAN HE

168
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:39,813
DOESN'T LIKE, HE SAYS KANYE

169
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:43,317
WEST IS ACTUALLY DESPITE ALL

170
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:46,720
APPEARANCES A PRACTICING WHY

171
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:47,788
WHY -- WHITE SUPREMACIST.

172
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,757
>> WE SHOULD SAY KANYE AS

173
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:52,393
AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE CANNOT

174
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:53,460
STAND IDLY BY WHY YOU GIVE

175
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,362
COVER TO A MAN WHO IS A WHITE

176
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:55,763
SUPREMACIST.

177
00:04:55,764 --> 00:05:00,734
THIS IS WHITE SUPREMACIST BY

178
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,403
VENTRILOQUISM.

179
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:04,538
WHITE RACIST IDEALS FLOWING

180
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:07,074
FROM KANYE WEST'S MOUTH.

181
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:07,908
>> Tucker: KEEP IN MIND THEY

182
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,376
ARE CALLING WEST THE CRAZY

183
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:09,743
ONE.

184
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:10,811
THEY DON'T MEAN IT.

185
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,147
THEY WOULDN'T BE SO ANGRY IF

186
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:14,415
THEY DID MEAN IT.

187
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,849
THE REAL FEAR IS THAT WEST

188
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,451
ISN'T CRAZY AT A AND YOU MIGHT

189
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:17,952
LISTEN TO HIM.

190
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:19,386
THIS IS NOT ABOUT WEST OR

191
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:19,753
TRUMP.

192
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,155
THIS IS ABOUT POWER.

193
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:22,623
MOST THINGS ARE.

194
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:24,959
SUDDENLY A SMALL NUMBER OF THE

195
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
IDEOLOGICAL GATEKEEPERS

196
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:27,361
CONTROL WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IN

197
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:29,697
THIS COUNTRY IS ALLOWED TO SAY

198
00:05:29,698 --> 00:05:30,464
AND THINK.

199
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,833
THE PEOPLE WORK AT GOOGLE,

200
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,368
CNN, IN THE U.S. SENATE AND

201
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,502
MAYBE DOWN THE HALL FROM THE

202
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:35,836
OFFICE.

203
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,605
IN THE CORPORATE SENSITIVITY

204
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:38,005
DEPARTMENT.

205
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:40,007
THEY ARE ENJOYING THE POWER

206
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,208
THEY HAVE BECAUSE PEOPLE

207
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,610
ALWAYS ENJOY HAVING POWER.

208
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:44,211
BUT THEY ARE WORRIED.

209
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:45,613
THEY CAN KNOW THEY CAN ONLY

210
00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:46,714
MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM, THE ONE

211
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:49,750
THEY BENEFIT FROM THROUGH FEAR

212
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:50,517
AND LYING.

213
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:51,919
IF ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DECIDE TO

214
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,921
IGNORE THE RULES AND THINK FOR

215
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:54,955
THEMSELVES THIS IS OVER.

216
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:59,326
THEY HAVE NO MORE POWER.

217
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:00,594
WHOLE COUNTRY OF PEOPLE SAYING

218
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:01,528
WHAT THEY THINK IS TRUE.

219
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,997
THAT IS THE NIGHTMARE AND WHAT

220
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:03,864
THEY FEAR THE MOST.

221
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,933
I COULD START WITH A SINGLE

222
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:06,333
PERSON.

223
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,435
WRAPPER SPEAKING STREAM OF

224
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,870
CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE OVAL

225
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:10,437
OFFICE ONE AFTERNOON.

226
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:12,072
FROM THERE, WHO KNOWS WHERE IT

227
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:12,740
COULD GO?

228
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,108
OTHER PEOPLE COULD STOP HIDING

229
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:15,242
THE UNAPPROVED OPINIONS.

230
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:17,611
THIS IS A TERRIFYING PROSPECT.

231
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:20,014
FREE SPEECH IS LIKE A VIRUS.

232
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:22,116
BETTER TO STOP IT WHILE YOU

233
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:22,449
CAN.

234
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,718
DON LEMON IS NO GENIUS BUT HE

235
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:25,519
UNDERSTANDS THAT.

236
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,221
MURDOCH IS A CONTRIBUTING

237
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:28,455
EDITOR AT NATIONAL REVIEW

238
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:31,959
ONLINE AND JOINS US TONIGHT.

239
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,360
WHAT ARE THEY REALLY SAYING

240
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:35,129
ABOUT KANYE WEST?

241
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,630
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS.

242
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:38,465
UNLIKE BACK IN THE 1960s IN

243
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:39,833
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT YOU MAY

244
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,635
RECALL A NUMBER OF PROTESTERS

245
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:42,936
HOLDING UP THE SIGNS SAYING,

246
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,705
"I AM A MAN."

247
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:46,740
HE IS NOT ABLE TO SAY THAT.

248
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:49,176
HE SAYS I AM NOT A MAN, I AM

249
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:51,011
NOT ALLOWED TO THINK ON MY

250
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:51,412
OWN.

251
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:55,416
I MUST DO WHAT THE LOCAL

252
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:56,350
ORTHODOXY SAYS.

253
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,452
SO HE DIDN'T DO THAT SO THEY

254
00:06:58,453 --> 00:07:09,630
ARE DENOUNCED HIM AS A NEGRO.

255
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:10,431
THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY.

256
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:11,732
YOU COME ON EVERY NIGHT AND

257
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,334
PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE WRONG BUT

258
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:14,868
NOBODY SAYS YOU ARE A BAD

259
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,603
WHITE PERSON.

260
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,072
>> Tucker: RIGHT.

261
00:07:18,073 --> 00:07:19,239
>> THEY DISAGREE WITH YOUR

262
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,574
VIEWS BUT THEY THEY HEART

263
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,642
ATTACK AIM AS A HUMAN BEING

264
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:23,277
AND TRY TO REMOVE HIS

265
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:24,712
BLACKNESS FROM HIM.

266
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:25,979
IT'S DISGUSTING.

267
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,415
>> Tucker: THEY ARE NOT EVEN

268
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,150
TREATING HIM AS A HUMAN.

269
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:33,721
THEY ARE TREATING HIM AS

270
00:07:33,722 --> 00:07:35,122
INTERCHANGEABLE PIECE OF A

271
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:35,756
LARGER WHOLE.

272
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:38,459
LIKE A FACENESS DRONE WHO HAS

273
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,226
TO OBEY.

274
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:40,527
>> HE HAS FALLEN OUT OF LINE.

275
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:41,929
THEY CAN'T HAVE THAT.

276
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,630
THE FEAR IS PEOPLE LISTEN AND

277
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,332
ASK QUESTIONS ISN'T IT

278
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,668
INTERESTING TO HAVE A

279
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:48,902
PRESIDENT THAT BROUGHT BLACK

280
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:50,037
UNEMPLOYMENT TO LOWEST LEVEL

281
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:50,904
OF HISTORY.

282
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,406
GROWING TWICE WHERE IT WAS TWO

283
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:53,440
YEARS AGO.

284
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:54,842
SUDDENLY THE BLACK FOLKS THINK

285
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,043
MAYBE HE IS WORKING OUT AND

286
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:58,412
THE POLICIES AREN'T RACIST

287
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:00,180
ATTACK WE HEARD ABOUT THEY

288
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:01,615
MIGHT TO VOTE THAT WAY.

289
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:03,817
DEMOCRATS WILL BE IN BUG

290
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:04,718
TROUBLE.

291
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:07,855
IT -- WILL BE IN BIG TROUBLE.

292
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:09,656
SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO

293
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:10,758
DEHUMANIZE HIM WHICH IS WHAT

294
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,393
THE LEFT IS DOING TONIGHT.

295
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:14,428
>> Tucker: HAVE YOU SEEN

296
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:14,762
THIS?

297
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:16,330
AM I MISREMEMBERING?

298
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:17,598
I DON'T REMEMBER PEOPLE TERMS

299
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,233
THAT ARE UGLY AND I'M NOT

300
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:20,734
GOING TO REPEAT THEM.

301
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,869
PEOPLE DIDN'T USED TO TALK

302
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,404
LIKE THAT IN TELEVISION UNTIL

303
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:23,837
RECENTLY.

304
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:24,471
>> NOT SO MUCH.

305
00:08:24,472 --> 00:08:29,209
NOT TO THIS LEVEL.

306
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,611
UNIFORMLY AND CONSISTENTLY

307
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:32,212
ACROSS ANY NUMBER OF THE CABLE

308
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,814
CHANNELS, THE VARIOUS PEOPLE

309
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:35,315
COMING OUT.

310
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:38,752
THE PROFESSOR DYSON FROM MY

311
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:40,154
ALMA MATER SAYING THE THINGS

312
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:44,124
THAT HE IS THAT KANYE IS A

313
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,026
WHITE PREM SUPREMACIST AND

314
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:48,228
VENTRILOQUIST AND TRUMP IS

315
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:49,363
PULLING HIS STRINGS.

316
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:50,931
IF TRUMP WERE A WHITE

317
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:56,170
SUPREMACIST WHY WOULD WE HAVE

318
00:08:56,171 --> 00:08:58,939
ONE OF THE BIGGEST BLACK

319
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,174
ARTISTS IN THE OVAL OFFICE?

320
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:01,542
IT MAKES NO SENSE.

321
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:04,278
IT'S NOT LOGICAL.

322
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,946
THIS SHOWS THE TREMENDOUS

323
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:07,347
DESPERATION OF WHICH THE

324
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:08,715
DEMOCRATIC LEFT FIND ITSELF

325
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:09,416
TODAY.

326
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:10,284
>> Tucker: IT'S INTERESTING

327
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:11,685
THE LEVEL OF BULLYING THAT

328
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:12,553
GOES ON.

329
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:17,057
IF THEY THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY,

330
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,126
THEY ARE SAYING HE IS CRAZY

331
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:21,228
AND IT'S OKAY NOW TO MOCK

332
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:22,930
PEOPLE'S MENTAL ILLNESS.

333
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:25,032
BUT IF THEY THOUGHT HE WAS OUT

334
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:29,136
OF HIS MIND THEY WOULD SMILE

335
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:30,137
INDULGENTLY LIKE YOU DO WITH

336
00:09:30,138 --> 00:09:32,706
THE GUY EATING IMAGINARY

337
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:34,208
INSECTS ON THE BUS.

338
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:34,575
RIGHT?

339
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:34,942
>> RIGHT.

340
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:36,510
HE TALKED ABOUT JOB CREATION

341
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,479
AND IMPROVING THE ECONOMY AND

342
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,017
THE CRIME DISASTER IN CHICAGO.

343
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:46,720
HE TALKED ABOUT THE MONTESSORI

344
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:47,120
SCHOOLS.

345
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:48,555
HE HAD SOLID THINGS TO SAY IN

346
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:48,922
THERE.

347
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,424
HE MADE A POINT WHERE IS IT

348
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,192
WRITTEN IF YOU ARE BLACK YOU

349
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,160
HAVE TO BE A DEMOCRAT?

350
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:55,195
HE IS BREAKING AWAY FROM THE

351
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:55,562
NOTION.

352
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:57,064
IF ENOUGH BLACKS BREAK AWAY

353
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:58,131
FROM THAT NOTION THE DEMOCRATS

354
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:01,068
WILL BE IN BAD STATE BECAUSE

355
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:02,536
BLACKS ARE A LARGE PART OF THE

356
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:03,036
DEMOCRATIC BASE.

357
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:05,239
IF EIGHT OUT OF TEN BLACK

358
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,508
FOLKS STAYED DEMOCRAT AND TWO

359
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,544
OUT OF TEN VOTE REPUBLICANS

360
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:12,212
THE DEMOCRATS WOULD BE LIKE

361
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:13,881
THE WHIG PARDON AND THEY WOULD

362
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:14,615
BE GONE.

363
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:15,482
>> Tucker: YOU HAVE OPINIONS

364
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:17,618
AND I CERTAINLY HAVE THEM ON

365
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:18,619
FULL DISPLAY.

366
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,922
WOULDN'T YOUR CONSCIENCE ACHE

367
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:23,257
A LITTLE IF YOU FOUND YOURSELF

368
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:25,726
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT REPEATING

369
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:26,760
NASTIEST TALKING POINT ON

370
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:27,961
BEHALF OF A POLITICAL PARTY

371
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,097
AND PRETENDING YOU WERE A

372
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:30,497
JOURNALIST.

373
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:34,835
WOULD YOU DO THAT?

374
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:35,869
>> I PRESENT OPINIONS AND I

375
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,838
TRY TO BACK THEM UP WITH THE

376
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,239
FACTS AND THE FIGURES AND THE

377
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,574
QUOTES AND EVIDENCE.

378
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:42,009
THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING

379
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:42,376
THAT.

380
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:46,280
THEY SCREAM TRUMP IS A RACIST.

381
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:49,950
A RACIST, A RACIST.

382
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:51,952
WHERE IS THE PROOF?

383
00:10:51,953 --> 00:10:55,489
IF HE WERE RACIST WHY DID HE

384
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,324
CAMPAIGN IN HISTORICALLY BLACK

385
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,725
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND

386
00:10:58,726 --> 00:10:59,993
WELCOME THEM WITH AN OFFICE IN

387
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:04,031
THE WHITE HOUSE TO ASSIST

388
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:04,364
THEM?

389
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:06,533
HE MADE M.L.K. BIRTHPLACE

390
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:08,835
NATIONAL HISTORICAL MONUMENT.

391
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,337
OBAMA COULD HAVE DONE THAT.

392
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:11,638
BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID THAT.

393
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,473
IT'S NOT BEHAVIOR TO SEE OUT

394
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:15,409
OF A WHITE SUPREMACIST.

395
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,577
>> Tucker: THEY ARE SAYING

396
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:18,779
WHAT THEY THINK THEY HAVE TO.

397
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,180
THIS IS REMARKABLE THE HACKS

398
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:20,847
THEY ARE.

399
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,083
>> AND CRUEL.

400
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:23,850
>> Tucker: I'M AGREE.

401
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,619
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

402
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,255
KANYE WEST BUT IT'S MEAN.

403
00:11:28,256 --> 00:00:00,000
TOO MEAN.
