00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800

<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so uh from an outsider's perspective</font>

22
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,559
where should the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people of Flint</font>

23
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,300
Michigan be placing the blame for the

24
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,449
water crisis right that's a great

25
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,070
question i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for anyone who's not</font>

26
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,140
following or who has is kind of new to

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,659
what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this is wasaga that's</font>

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,400
been playing out over the last year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,810
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know the citizens have</font>

30
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,360
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> complaining over the last year</font>

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,080
worried that there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong</font>

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">with their water</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've seen everyone</font>

33
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,600
from local officials to state officials

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,759
to agent like local state and even

35
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,450
national agencies like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> aep a sort of</font>

36
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,369
their blame questioned in this and I

37
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's right that when you have more</font>

38
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">than 30,000 homes in a major American</font>

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">city at risk for lead contamination that</font>

40
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,119
people want to look for someone to blame

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,490
unfortunately though it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only been over</font>

42
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,170
the last few weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's emails</font>

43
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,909
coming out from the governor's office a

44
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,070
lot of FOIA requests are finally being

45
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,420
answered and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> starting to get a</font>

46
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,570
little more<font color="#E5E5E5"> insight into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how this all</font>

47
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,090
happened and I think unfortunately are

48
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,500
not going to know for a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> more months</font>

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,200
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know who's to blame but I</font>

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely think you know this was a</font>

51
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:59,100
political decision this was you know

52
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,390
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of there were some</font>

53
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,520
definite errors that were made when what

54
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,439
happened was when the city of flint

55
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,530
decided to switch its water system from

56
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,090
Detroit water to its own river to the

57
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,949
Flint River and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were some mistakes</font>

58
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">made in how to treat the water and</font>

59
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,269
because that water ended up being quite

60
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,030
corrosive it leached the pipes on its

61
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,650
way into people's homes and took<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead</font>

62
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,319
with it so yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're still you</font>

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,370
know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really still we're trying to</font>

64
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,870
put together all the pieces of how this

65
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,790
happened what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the timeline was who knew</font>

66
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,400
what when they knew it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how high up</font>

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,439
can we go to place blame and I think you

68
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">know as right now where people are</font>

69
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,510
really just trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to patch some of the</font>

70
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,220
user sort of put a bandaid on the

71
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,349
problem get water get fresh<font color="#E5E5E5"> water to</font>

72
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,000
people in who cannot drink the water<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,220
their homes and then I think at the same

74
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">time there's a sort of parallel effort</font>

75
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,909
to figure out how this happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how</font>

76
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,139
do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent this from happening again</font>

77
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,359
so you know unfortunately I can't really

78
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:54,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">speculate who exactly is to blame but I</font>

79
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,069
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know people this is going to</font>

80
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:57,840
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in the over the series of the</font>

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,790
next couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> months you know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

82
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,269
officials and what policies led to this

83
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:06,209
and how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> the city capitalize off of</font>

84
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,189
the 15 minutes of fame because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

85
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,629
the first it's the first time in a long

86
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,220
time where<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are actually paying</font>

87
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,689
attention other than it being the most

88
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:14,730
dangerous city in America<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and a</font>

89
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,220
bunch of other bad things right I think

90
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I talk</font>

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">to people about this I talked to almost</font>

92
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,500
everyone about this in my conversations

93
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,930
last week because<font color="#E5E5E5"> right as you point out</font>

94
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,790
Flint has had a rough couple of decades

95
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,760
they've lost thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of jobs as the</font>

96
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,859
auto industry has tanked and they've

97
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,599
seen their crime rates skyrocket they're

98
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,980
constantly you know noted<font color="#E5E5E5"> as one of the</font>

99
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,470
most dangerous cities in the country and

100
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,150
then all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden you get this you</font>

101
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,129
get their entire water system is

102
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,389
contaminated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead you have an</font>

103
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,040
entire generation of kids whose health

104
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,079
is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> affected as a result so</font>

105
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,699
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite easy to look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

106
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,340
wow one more kind of you know depressing

107
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,780
thing happening to Flint but maybe

108
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,220
there's a way to actually use this to

109
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,560
turn things around or to at least as you

110
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,909
said capitalize on the 15 minutes of

111
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,010
fame and I think you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I heard a</font>

112
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,940
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different things from</font>

113
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,680
residents while i was there one being

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
that everyone in<font color="#E5E5E5"> flint it's a tough city</font>

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,280
these people have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

116
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,530
they're resilient so this will just be

117
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,180
another example of that and you can see

118
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in all the activism that is sort of</font>

119
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,989
bubbled up around this people were

120
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,699
consistently told over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last year by</font>

121
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,560
their state you know elected officials

122
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,659
that their water was fine and they knew

123
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">that wasn't the case and they joined</font>

124
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,930
together and push back and push back so

125
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,610
you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and i think that's sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

126
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,139
giving an interesting vibe to the city

127
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,600
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now sort of this coming to</font>

128
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're people are out at water centers</font>

129
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,360
people are seeing their neighbors<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

130
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,220
are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each other all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

131
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,660
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing so I mean there's that</font>

132
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,550
side I've also heard you know from local

133
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,970
business businessmen and investors in

134
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">flint itself and then also in other</font>

135
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,000
parts of the state<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there is a lot of</font>

136
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,940
talk of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how can we bring in</font>

137
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,250
more investment and then we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

138
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,390
have to bring in all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> services</font>

139
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,760
because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to fix the</font>

140
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,990
lead piping they're going to have to

141
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">take care of these children who now are</font>

142
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,500
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk for behavioral issues and all</font>

143
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,060
these other health effects from lead and

144
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,260
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to bring in experts</font>

145
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,330
and all this stuff so maybe there's a

146
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,300
way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can sort of use this to also</font>

147
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,190
bring back investment and bring in kind

148
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,880
of a renewed resiliency and renewed sort

149
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,610
of energy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the city I think there's</font>

150
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,020
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> people trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be optimistic</font>

151
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,190
we'll have to see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually</font>

152
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,720
happens but I think it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's</font>

153
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,080

167
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,730
looking at doing in the imminent future

168
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,020

172
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,890
to start happening but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you know</font>

173
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,960
as governor rick snyder of machine has

174
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,310
been you know saying over and over again

175
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,230
his focus right now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting people</font>

176
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,270
clean water which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all well and good</font>

177
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,070
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do think you know down the road</font>

178
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">people want bigger they want a bigger</font>

179
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,570
fix for this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the lead pipes</font>

180
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,890
have been you know no one's really

181
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,960
actually sure how severe the damages<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

182
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,120
the pipes but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

183
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,160
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost millions of</font>

184
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix and it will take some</font>

185
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,000
time it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know</font>

186
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's thousands of you know pipelines</font>

187
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,570
throughout the city that may need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

188
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,390
replaced and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's going to be</font>

189
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,590
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question we'll have to see how long</font>

190
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,760
will it take i think but the bigger

191
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,320
question is when are we going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide</font>

192
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at that and who's going</font>

193
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pay for it that's a great question to</font>

194
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,870
be asking that's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're a</font>

195
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,889
journalist

196
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:42,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh hi speaking of questions I know Gabe</font>

197
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:43,909
is on skype and he's got some questions

198
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:46,159
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> him soon would say to Gabe but my</font>

199
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">question was in regards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the emergency</font>

200
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:50,960
manager<font color="#CCCCCC"> law that seems to be at the</font>

201
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,060
center or at least what a lot of people

202
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,340
are pointing to right and my question

203
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">was since everybody has a lot of</font>

204
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,860
complaint about this law arm why is it

205
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can they challenge the law court</font>

206
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,629
if they can't why can't they so I'll try

207
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,580
to do a brief summary<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the emergency</font>

208
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">manager law because I know it gets</font>

209
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:13,400
thrown<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in sentences a lot in these</font>

210
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,930
articles and maybe not everyone's super

211
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,219
familiar with it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a great</font>

212
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">question to ask so there's a law in</font>

213
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,110
Michigan past you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple decades</font>

214
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,029
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then was sort of revamped when</font>

215
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:26,449
Governor Snyder came in in 2011 and this

216
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:30,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">act allows the state to put it in what's</font>

217
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,539
called an emergency financial manager in

218
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,060
either a city or a school system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

219
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,800
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is there supposed to</font>

220
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">become the kind of like all-powerful</font>

221
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,009
official of that city and their main aim

222
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:45,889
is to balance the budget so what we saw

223
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:48,229
in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cities over the last few</font>

224
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:50,599
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> are selling you know privatizing</font>

225
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:53,900
public parks municipal golf courses we

226
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,729
also see cutting of you know pensions

227
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:57,649
and that sort of thing in ways to

228
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">balance budget everywhere from Detroit</font>

229
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,509
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Flint and all across the state so</font>

230
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:05,419
that's what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> with influenza</font>

231
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,069
water was switched in it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Detroit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

232
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">Flint there was an emergency manager in</font>

233
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,599
control and because the emergency

234
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,129
manager was in control he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

235
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:14,779
sign off on yep we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

236
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:16,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">using the Flint River and we're going to</font>

237
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,960
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead with building our own water</font>

238
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,839
authority because he was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

239
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">that decision there was no need there</font>

240
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,659
and he sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time I guess he's</font>

241
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:28,699
over taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the powers of the local</font>

242
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:30,050
officials there were no public meetings

243
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,219
there were no public hearings there were

244
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,839
no votes there was no<font color="#CCCCCC"> City Council vote</font>

245
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,179
on this he just signed off<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it so</font>

246
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,589
that's why a lot of people have you know

247
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:39,110
pointed to this laws like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the city</font>

248
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,250
wasn't even able to make their own

249
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,719
decision in this this was essentially

250
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,480
someone acting in the state capacity

251
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,269
making this decision now when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

252
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this law and why people haven't</font>

253
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,870
why people or how people might be able

254
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> repeal this this has been a super</font>

255
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,150
controversial

256
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,800
there's been groups pushing<font color="#CCCCCC"> back up</font>

257
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,600
against against it since it was passed

258
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,690
and actually after it was passed in 2011

259
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,190
there's a public referendum that shot

260
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,320
down the law but then the legislature

261
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,330
was able to come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and repass it</font>

262
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,650
there's some sort of loopholes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

263
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Michigan law making that allows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

264
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,900
happen and so it was passed anyways and

265
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,010
the emergency manager was given these

266
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,440
powers there have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been attempts to file</font>

267
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,200
lawsuits against it most of these

268
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,180
lawsuits have been either rejected or

269
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,070
stripped down there's one currently that

270
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,450
has been allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue on the</font>

271
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,580
basis that the policy could be

272
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,530
discriminatory because a majority of the

273
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">citizens in cities run by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emergency</font>

274
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,080
managers are black so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

275
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> racial issue pointed to this</font>

276
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,890
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only part of this these</font>

277
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,120
lawsuits that have been allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

278
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,690
proceed then basically the only step to

279
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,670
get rid of this law though it seems is

280
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,260
going to be legislative action in the

281
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,300
state and<font color="#CCCCCC"> democratic lawmakers have</font>

282
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,220
pushed forward a lot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last few</font>

283
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,170
days<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get this done but there's a</font>

284
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,090
supermajority in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michigan's legislature</font>

285
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,730
made up of on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Republican side and</font>

286
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,500
they're in favor tend to be in favor of

287
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,390
this emergency manager law so it will be

288
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,800
interesting interesting to see whether

289
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,890
this gets passed or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

290
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right well Gabe thanks for</font>

one here's a go figure he's right here's

295
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,810
Fredrik Fredrik says I'm from Sweden so

296
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,920
I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really heard about the water</font>

297
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,540
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually life</font>

298
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,040
threatening to drink the water there in

299
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">Flint so basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Frederick's wondering</font>

300
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,830
what happens if you drink the water

301
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,450
right so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's you know</font>

302
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously that's what probably a lot of</font>

303
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,260
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are wondering i think you know if</font>

304
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,640
you drink the water do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> immediately</font>

305
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,010
like keel over and die no that's

306
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,380
probably not the case but over the last

307
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,880
year people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been seeing brown and</font>

308
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,200
yellow water coming out of their taps

309
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,940
you have residents complaining of rashes

310
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,310
losing hair people attributing this

311
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,690
everything from killing their plants to

312
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,000
killing their dogs but<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately not</font>

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,190
enough has really been analyzed to

314
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,540
figure out you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

315
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,030
capacity to connect all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font>

316
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,320
you know when someone had a rash on

317
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,460
their leg was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of their</font>

318
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,870
water was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of something else</font>

319
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,450
but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do know right now are the</font>

320
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,899
lead levels are too high in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the water</font>

321
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,240
they surpass legal you know guidelines

322
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,879
and recommendations and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scariest</font>

323
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,709
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this is that when a child is</font>

324
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:14,230
exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to high amounts of lead whether</font>

325
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,149
it's in water or paint chips this

326
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:18,430
immediately immediately can affect their

327
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,749
develop you know their childhood

328
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:21,249
development and this will affect them

329
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:22,480
throughout the rest of their lives so

330
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,220
that's sort of it it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the long</font>

331
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,990
the medium and long term that's really

332
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,220
scary is that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to</font>

333
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,199
monitor this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> core cohort of</font>

334
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,959
children for the foreseeable future in a

335
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,579
city where children are already start

336
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,550
off with a pretty rough outlook on life

337
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,829
so that's sort of all we can really tell

338
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:40,059
at this point I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think there's</font>

339
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:42,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">been there's been some recent link</font>

340
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,920
linkage to a Legionnaires outbreak in

341
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,660
Flint to the water so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> starting to</font>

342
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,490
see some of these other illnesses

343
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,980
surface and I think we'll it'll be

344
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to see I guess what the</font>

345
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,350
direct connections are between all of

346
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,589
these and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start to see more as we</font>

347
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:58,899
learn additional details about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the water</font>

348
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:01,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">supply great Frederick I hope you've</font>

356
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,399
have a political<font color="#CCCCCC"> question for you why do</font>

357
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> president obama</font>

358
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:26,529
hasn't declared<font color="#CCCCCC"> Flint a disaster area</font>

359
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:29,170
and do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font>

360
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,329
partisan politics that are underlying

361
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:34,990
all of the the response to the crisis

362
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,179
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah those are important points to</font>

363
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:39,220
be asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about I think people were a</font>

364
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,319
little disappointed last week when Obama

365
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:42,639
came to Flint and I think they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

366
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,259
of hoping he<font color="#CCCCCC"> era</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came to Detroit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

367
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,459
think they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping he might come to</font>

368
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:48,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">Flint he did not he stayed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in Detroit</font>

369
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:49,509
where he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the coming</font>

370
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,490
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the auto industry but he did you</font>

371
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,509
know talk about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the problems</font>

372
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,040
that were happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Flint and he has</font>

373
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,019
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of highlighted that he some of the</font>

374
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,730
policy failures that led to this issue

375
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,249
at the same time he's put millions of

376
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:01,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know tens of millions of</font>

377
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:03,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars towards the Emergency Relief</font>

378
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,589
Fund but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right he hasn't declared</font>

379
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:08,499
this a major disaster now<font color="#E5E5E5"> governor</font>

380
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:10,209
Snyder has repealed this decision then

381
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,230
there's been a lot of back and forth

382
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,360
that it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a major disaster and</font>

383
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,279
whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technical decision or</font>

384
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,600
whether that's a political decision is

385
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,730
really you know it's unclear

386
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,360
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it is an important point to</font>

387
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,010
note that the administration has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

388
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,800
relatively quiet when talking about

389
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,320
specifics of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Flint controversy and</font>

390
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,089
they haven't really placed blame they

391
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,589
haven't really you know talked about

392
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:34,060
specific programs but I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

393
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,370
federal officials have been in the state

394
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,839
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with locals and state</font>

395
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,910
of agencies and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think also part of</font>

396
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,130
this has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with there's a lot we</font>

397
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,750
don't know we don't know exactly what

398
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,120
response is going to be needed we don't

399
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,800
know how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> money is going to be</font>

400
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,240
needed who's going to pay for it it

401
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,920
might depend you know if the state it

402
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,360
ends up being<font color="#E5E5E5"> at fault or local</font>

403
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,980
officials or is it going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show up on</font>

404
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">this tax bills of the citizens of Flint</font>

405
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,110
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a feeling you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't say</font>

406
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,449
for certain but I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> as more</font>

407
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,550
information comes out we might see you

408
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,070
no more solid action from state and

409
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,000
national officials great thanks thanks

410
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,550
Kayla thanks Russ yeah thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us and</font>

418
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,240
reporting on this so earlier you touched

419
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,569
on the fact that it was difficult at

420
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:42,100
this point to a sign blame to or to

421
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,500
start assigning blame to really get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

422
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bottom of this that right now the</font>

423
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the emphasis is really on fixing the</font>

424
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,600
problem and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sorting out who is</font>

425
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,430
responsible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

426
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes at a later date but I did see that</font>

427
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,370
vice had published an article a few days

428
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,050
ago about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the governor's had</font>

429
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:10,209
released all these emails related to the

430
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,720
this ongoing crisis and there's this

431
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,540
seven-month get a gap where no emails

432
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,970
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the water supply issue were were</font>

433
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,329
released and I'm curious and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm</font>

434
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:26,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking because you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know soliciting</font>

435
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:31,209
conjecture but I'm curious if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

436
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:32,610
that you're really

437
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,620
is were no emails that during that

438
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:44,130
period and I guess as a follow-up elbow

439
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,110
follow-up I guess in no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font>

440
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,660
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't want to totally</font>

441
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,250
speculate on whether or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there were</font>

442
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,779
emails I think you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people</font>

443
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,310
are doing that right now I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

444
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,870
seven month gap is really quite that

445
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,470
month long gap is if there were no

446
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,120
emails it's concerning because that was

447
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,230
the height of the problem that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

448
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,790
you're seeing the highest level<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests</font>

449
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,560
coming back that's what people were

450
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,180
starting to scream the loudest that's

451
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,620
when you were seeing hospital research

452
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,690
coming back that we're showing kids had

453
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,810
high blood blood blood blood levels so

454
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,880
it's definitely something we're

455
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,769
questioning and you know we did we have

456
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:20,399
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> reporting on that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think people</font>

457
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,839
are hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's going to be</font>

458
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,390
answers coming in future emails or some

459
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,470
of the other emails we're seeing from

460
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the state agencies but if you really do</font>

461
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,029
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are someone who thinks there was</font>

462
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:31,800
a higher level of like neglect or

463
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,990
knowledge at the state level<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also</font>

464
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,880
don't think we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> rely on those answers</font>

465
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,970
coming through emails and so it could go

466
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,529
either way maybe there were emails sent

467
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:42,240
or maybe there weren't but unfortunately

468
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,709
we don't know because the michigan

469
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,959
governor's office is exempt from<font color="#CCCCCC"> foia</font>

470
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">requests so they get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide what they</font>

471
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,910
put out in what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't sit um so I</font>

472
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,410
I'm a lawyer and so I have dealt with

473
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:00,410
FOIA before and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I've sort of been</font>

474
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,300
seeing behind the scenes as to the way

475
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:08,099
that the government gets to sort of play

476
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,030
fast and loose with what they choose to

477
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,049
release and it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> after often you</font>

478
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:18,299
know the most damaging things come out

479
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,839
only after a they're compelled to be

480
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,250
done so by a judge so yet you mentioned

481
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the governor's office is exempt</font>

482
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,679
from requests and that they get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

483
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,770
choose but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there any avenues</font>

484
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,030
where they could be forced to be more

485
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,220
candid and they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> found thorough</font>

486
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,220
in their disclosures mm-hmm well it's

487
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,150
hard to say I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty</font>

488
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,110
unprecedented

489
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,760
this is a pretty unprecedented crisis

490
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,730
for the state and this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first time</font>

491
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,710
we're seeing a governor<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

492
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowledge the first time we're seeing a</font>

493
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">michigan governor actually released his</font>

494
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,809
emails or conversations because this is

495
00:17:57,809 --> 00:17:59,760
a long-standing law that the governor's

496
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,780
office specifically is exempt and so

497
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,940
again they're just choosing to do this

498
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">as sort of a key not kind of like making</font>

499
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,470
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the public look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will like</font>

500
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,200
release our emails<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think what's going</font>

501
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be crucial and finding out the</font>

502
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">information we really want to know it's</font>

503
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,720
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through there's a</font>

504
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,130
congressional hearing next week where

505
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">governor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Snyder will be testifying there</font>

506
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,049
is Michigan's Attorney General has

507
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:27,720
opened an investigation and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

508
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,470
there's you know there's a couple

509
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,750
lawsuits federal lawsuits that are being

510
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,150
put into place so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> through some</font>

511
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,010
of those avenues and you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

512
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,390
evidence collecting and that sort of

513
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,000
thing we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> see hopefully that's</font>

514
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,410
where we'll see evidence coming to light

515
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,270
proving or disproving any theories

516
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,030
people have about state culpability and

517
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,140
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's where we're going to see</font>

518
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,370
it I you know unfortunately I don't

519
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

520
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,280
come through boy as at this point we're

521
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,480
hearing we're getting great little

522
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,770
details from these<font color="#CCCCCC"> foils</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

523
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,540
putting the pieces together of the

524
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,220
timeline<font color="#E5E5E5"> but when it comes to sort of</font>

525
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,270
the bigger picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what actually</font>

526
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened it might take these court cases</font>

527
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,429
and you know congressional hearings and

528
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:04,260
all that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really find out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

529
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,549
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> great question i mean i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

530
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:08,549
all waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it sure and I mean it's</font>

531
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:12,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">just it's a you know that's tough</font>

532
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,020
because it's so difficult to prove you

533
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">know say I was injured in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

534
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,059
cause of my injury was that you know the

535
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,740
emanated water so in order to sort of

536
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,010
succeed in on the merits and then

537
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,210
getting them to you know admit<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

538
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,820
whatever right ability it just seems

539
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">like if it happens at all it's a long</font>

540
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,100
way away<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah exactly this is and that's</font>

541
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,590
a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and I'm it would that's a</font>

542
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">great way to end this conversation is</font>

543
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,190
that you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of a sudden</font>

544
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,960
after a year of people pushing back this

545
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,490
is in national headlines and people are

546
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,660
paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention and we're focused on</font>

547
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,460
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> emergency getting people water but</font>

548
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,470
this story doesn't end in two weeks when

549
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,940
people go home and when news reporters

550
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,860
go home and when the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the fervor</font>

551
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,460
starts to

552
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,990
the people of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Flint are going to be</font>

553
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,190
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these effects for a</font>

554
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,440
lifetime for some of these children<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

555
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,470
