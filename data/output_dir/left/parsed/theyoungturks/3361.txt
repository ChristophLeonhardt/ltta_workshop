WE ARE THE LONGEST-RUNNING
DAILY STREAM ON THE PLANET, NO
ONE HAS BEEN STREAMING DAILY
LONGER THAN WE HAVE COME WE
STARTED IN 2005, AND WE HAD
DIFFERENT POINTS WHERE WE WERE
KIND OF AMAZED AT WHAT HAPPENED,
I REMEMBER I WROTE AN ARTICLE IN
THE HUFFINGTON POST A MILLION
YEARS AGO ABOUT HOW WE CROSSED
100 MILLION VIEWS, THAT'S HOW
MANY PEOPLE WATCH THE SUPER
BOWL, I INVENTED A THING CALLED
THE SUPER BOWL STANDARD WHERE IF
YOU GOT 100 MILLION VIEWS YOU
WERE A LEGIT SHOW.
IN 2010 WE
CROSSED 300
MILLION VIEWS, THAT'S THE NUMBER
OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY.
NOT EVERY VIEW IS A UNIQUE
VIEWER BUT THAT'S STILL A
LOT OF USE.
GUESS WHAT WE CROSSED TODAY?
>>310 MILLION VIEWS.
>>IT HAS BEEN A SLOW SEVEN
YEARS, THAT'S RIGHT.
>>IT REALLY PEAKED AT THAT POINT
AND WENT DOWN.
>>WE PASSED 7.6 BILLION VIEWS,
THAT IS THE WORLD'S POPULATION.
I THINK IT'S MOMENTOUS AND
IT'S NOT A THING A LOT OF
CHANNELS OR SHOWS OR NETWORKS
GET, THAT'S A DECENT NUMBER.
HERE IS A LOOK BACK AT SOME OF
THOSE THRESHOLDS.
>>300 MILLION IS A GOOD NUMBER,
WE ARE DOING A PRESS RELEASE AND
THEY GOT WORKED UP AND I SAID
THAT'S THE SIZE OF THE U.S.
POPULATION.
YOU KNOW WHAT OUR
NEXT TARGET IS?
THE SIZE OF THE
ENTIRE WORLD.
ON THE ROAD TO 6
BILLION, ALTHOUGH BY THE TIME WE
HIT IT IT MIGHT BE 7 BILLION.
>>A COUPLE DAYS AGO WE PASSED A
BILLION VIEWS.
>>WHAT THE HELL?
>>2 BILLION VIEWS.
>>THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE.
>>WE JUST CROSSED 5 BILLION.
>>IMAGINE 10
YEARS AGO THINKING ONE DAY --
PEOPLE WILL BE LIKE ARE YOU
NUTS?
>>YOUNG TURKS CROSSES 6 BILLION
VIEWS.
>>THEY SAID YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE
MEDIA, DON'T TRY, HERE WE
ARE, WE ARE CHANGING THE MEDIA,
THANK YOU.
>>THAT IS YOU GUYS, IF YOU
DIDN'T WATCH WE WOULDN'T EXIST.
SO ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU, AND I
THINK YOU HAVE GIVEN US AN
ABILITY TO SEND THE MESSAGE TO
THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT IS
NEEDED AND THAT WE COULDN'T HAVE
DONE WITHOUT YOU GUYS POWERING
THE SHOW, SO I HELL OF A NUMBER
AND I JUST CAN'T THANK YOU
ENOUGH.
GOD BLESS.
EXCEPT NOW
THE NEW GOAL IS GOING TO HAVE TO
BE THE UNIVERSE.
