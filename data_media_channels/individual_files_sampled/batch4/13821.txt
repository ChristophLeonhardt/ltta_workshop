just broken some new news this has just come out from The Associated Press this is incredible Trump administration officials have been sending babies and other young children Oh - at least three hmm put up the graphic of this thank you could we have it no three tender age shelters in South Texas lawyers and medical providers just think I'm gonna have to hand this off yeah sorry that does the first night we'll see again tomorrow no it is time for the last word lawrence O'Donnell where he is live in Brownsville Texas thank you very much Rachel we just got word you know I hate to criticize my twin here I hate to attack family that is one of the worst performances I have ever seen as an actor I am listen I've been in these indie movies and little things I'm not saying that you know I've been in the great movies of all time or Citizen Kane every performance I've done is a Sidney Poitier compared to what she just did on MSNBC it was so unbelievable it just wasn't incredible performance but I don't know maybe that's why she makes more money than me she's at least willing to go out there and humiliate herself and pretend to cry over this totally contrived issue why is this a totally contrived issue why because they've really been ringing this one for all it's worth out there on the left even though we present them with facts don't we so then she says oh gosh oh oh oh no it's so awful well she wasn't shedding those tears when Barack Obama was doing exactly the same thing was she unfortunately for the I you know someone I think was Ann Coulter said that the immigrant children are crisis actors I'm not saying that but Rachel Maddow definitely is a crisis actor because that it just isn't true she wasn't crying when Barack Obama was doing these things under the Obama administration and we have the photos to prove it folks Barack Obama put these kids in shelters twice as many kids as Donald Trump has you saw all those photos of kids sleeping under sinks packed you know a bunch of them in a room wrapped up in those little tin foil blankets that they give you on marathons that make you look like a twice baked potato there all of these kids piled on top of one another during the Obama administration not a peep from Rachel Maddow not a nary a tear fell from her face isn't that luckily for us now we've got the proper vessel so when they start pouring we can start sipping them and they're all delicious but that you know handcuffed you would even see some photos under the Obama administration it would say juvenile holding cell so just in case it wasn't clear the Democrats tried to spin it these are holding cells for children they even had some that said female juvenile holding cell which is really the great outrage of the Obama administration because he was assuming people's gender how outrageous I mean that's the worst crime of all isn't it I can't believe the intersectional left didn't raise a ruckus about that what else in the Obama administration well there was an immigrant illegal alien Nancy Luna who sued for wrongful death sued the Obama administration in 2014 for the wrongful death of her husband because he had type 2 diabetes he was being held by the Obama administration wasn't given medical care was Rachel crying about I don't remember Rachel shedding tears about that she didn't recount that to us at our family reunion did she the Barack Obama administration admitted sicced admitted 16 admitted ms-13 members into the country so we let them all just come right in these these were people who we knew had affiliation with ms-13 he placed over a dozen kids in the custody of human traffickers known human traffickers why because he didn't perform a background check the Obama administration didn't perform a background check what else oh yes so there have been a handful of cases in the Trump administration relatively a handful of cases we're talking about a couple thousand kids who are being held because what else are we going to do with them are we gonna we can't send them right back immediately we can't let them into the country unaccompanied then given amnesty are allowed to break our laws and fly our laws under Obama there were over 100,000 cases between 2010 and 2016 immigrant cases that separated families 100,000 not a tear from Rachel Maddow isn't that strange in 2014 alone by the way this is a really funny irony because now he's saying these kids are coming in and they're holding them they're encouraging kids to come in and they're going to be a hold elde in 2014 alone around 70,000 unaccompanied minors crossed into the United States illegally 70,000 and and the left then it's very hard to keep track of these things the left bend was encouraging it they said yeah come on over here yeah then you Detention Center yeah come on over now it's the worst crime in the history of the country why because they don't really believe it they don't really believe it there if they really believed it Rachel Maddow would have really been crying there and more more to the point she would have cried in in 2014 when Barack Obama was doing these exact same things we I want to get to what this speaks to because this is the essential aspect of our time Chesterton's fence this is the Reformers the reformers who yell do something do something tear this down change this do something right before we get to Chesterton's friends and make Chesterton's fence ten feet higher folks we got to bring on Derek we have a good guest he has a book out that really is a proper timing the book is called outrage incorporated how the liberal mob ruined science journalism and Hollywood Derek thank you for being here thanks for having me Michael yeah I couldn't have picked the timing any better but I'm still jealous of your book I I wish I had thought that for the research you did it had to have started when you were a teen the research started from when I was a little boy I've been researching that book all of my life the timing there was very well too because it was something about early 2017 really made people understand the important thesis in my book reasons to vote for Democrats a comprehensive guide but I could you know listen I always knew you're a gentleman now I know that you're a scholar as well this book talks about the outrage that we're seeing pouring out I mean my my leftist years tumblr has been overflowing for the last few days everybody is outraged all the time when did it start why did it story well there's always been an element of it on the fringe of the left they've just been the angry left ready to take to the streets but the main part of the party the establishment of the party kind of kept them at bay now they're the base so they've got a ready-made a table of unwashed mutants ready to march at a moment's notice the the day after Trump was inaugurated they took to the streets he hadn't done anything but they knew he had to be opposed two weeks later they marched for science he hadn't done anything but they knew he was going to grow everything it is an amazing feat of marketing to sit there and tell somebody be angry all the time and have it work I wish I had that ability but the the reason behind it is if you keep people angry or you keep people scared Michael you're not thinking rationally you've been mad at your remote controller you've stubbed your toe on your coffee table or something and you you've cursed or thrown something in a fit of anger you're not thinking rationally you wouldn't normally do that but if you're angry or you're not thinking and that is what the left has to do to keep their base motivated because otherwise what do they offer in come November Bernie Sanders crazy a job for everybody well we've got basically full employment so he's miss right on that we already have it now for everybody Medicare for everybody well we just found out that in 2026 that's going bankrupt so you know if somebody's willing to give you a first-class ticket on the Titanic you're still going to hit the iceberg so they've got to keep people from thinking rationally and it's been on display it this week I love the Democrats running down there saying Donald Trump is using these poor sweet nourishing children as human props while they're making sure that they're framed properly in front of these poor sweet nourishing children that they're using as human props it it's evil it's crass it's ballsy but it's not surprising in the least I'm just jealous that they're so good at it I wish I could be that good at it oh well I want to get to the doomsday cult and where this crazy outrage might spring from I have a thesis on it front based on what I read in your book but before that you know we're talking about all of these happy children at the border I want to talk about another way to make children happy and that would be little bits how's that for a segue little bits an award-winning platform of easy to use electronic building blocks for creating inventions large and small that's the best segment we've ever done right we got it I want an award for that it is really cool it is great so I've got this for my little nephew when I got this they that little bit sent me their cool droid kit you know there's Star Wars droid kit and so they send it over here and I'm so coming I'm gonna give it to my little nephew that'll be a nice thing all of the 30 year olds at the Daily wire jump on top of me they're like you know leeches trying to get this toy to play with themselves it is very cool it is a super cool toy the complete Droid kid has six bits 20 droid parts three sticker sheets in a free app the app has step-by-step instructions video tutorials it's got drive mode force mode self nav 2000 authentic sounds from the Star Wars films and Yuka and you build your own droid so you can reconfigure it in ways to create brand-new droids kids learn to control electronics with code in missions this requires a smart device so you get to use it do it from your phone or your mobile device it's really cool I was into Star Wars as a kid if this thing had been around there's no question this would be the number one toy yet and I think that's the reason it keeps winning awards you got the toy Association's 2018 toy of the year for your kids and inspire invention it is so so good visit little bits dot-com slash Noel's canno wles get $10 off a droid inventor kit don't say I never did nothing for you little bits comm slash Noel's ko wles ten bucks off a droid adventure kit this is the gift to get I always worry you know with my nephews or nieces what am I gonna get them I don't you know I'm not like totally in the kid culture these days what am I gonna get them for a gift for Christmas or any holiday get them this little bit's the complete droid kit and save some money little bits comm slash Noel's so Derek you know on this outrage question where it all came from very early on in the book you say this is firstworldproblems that there is a sociological function that when people have it too good they need something to complain about and then you also talk about the doomsday cult of global warming and I've always noticed the environmentalist movement really launched into full form after the fall of the Berlin Wall after the Cold War ended after our actual existential threat ended the left just made one up it just invented one out of whole cloth Oh is all of this outrage just an aspect and a consequence of our luxury and our decadent society a large part of it is when the Berlin Wall fell in the Soviet Union went away the left lost they were basically rooting for that side so they needed to come up with another way to oppose capitalism and individual liberty and that was a ready-made one there with the environment what better way to scare the crap out of somebody than to say you're destroying the planet we are destroying the planet we must now cede our Liberty our property to the government in order to save the entire planet and of course if you remember the 90s in the early 2000s Al Gore was running around going those ten years ten years or it's too late if we don't do something now it'll be too late well that came and went and we haven't I'm in New York I didn't take a gondola to my hotel we are not flooded the storms that we were promised didn't happen they weren't more frequent they weren't more powerful so rather than what a normal human being would do when something like that goes wrong and reflect like hey maybe I was wrong about this they decided smartly from a diabolical point of view to extend the time frame it used to be ten-year predictions now its 100-year predictions you Michael Knowles if you predict it come Friday the world will end and you get a bunch of followers Saturday morning you're gonna have some explaining to do but if you decide no no in a hundred years the world will end well you can't prove that but more importantly you can't disprove that and now if you look at the climate change studies they are 100-year predictions they talk about the year 2100 because nobody will be around to recognize that they were full of it that they were lied to but we must act now of course the answer is always now whether it was climate global cooling in the 50s which was a ready for Dan was writing about it in the 50s or global warming in the 80s and 90s or just generic climate change we always must act now in the solution ironically was always the same very curious no matter what the problem was the solution was the same which would cause a normal person to go that's weird when the problem was the exact opposite the solution was the same so they again they have to scare the hell out of you or something like that a question like that might occur to you yeah I love that that's the argument for socialism now the earth is getting too cold therefore we need socialism the earth is getting too warm therefore we need socialism the earth is either changing or staying the same therefore we need socialism it's always big big government has failed what we need is bigger government right obviously the solution it's insane but if you're not a thinking person it makes sense you know and that is this is the Chesterton's fence thing we're gonna be talking about that later in the show that they just say we have to do something now in 350 million years the earth is going to have two degrees higher temperatures therefore we need to do something do something do something right the big promoters of this hysteria the big outrage vendors are the journalists quote-unquote from the mainstream media or the journalists I think there are three options are they stupid hysterical or cynical I guess they're not all mutually exclusive but do they really believe what they're selling do they really buy their own product it's impossible to get into somebody's head no matter how much room there is in there and there's a lot of empty space in these journalists heads but I would say it's a little from all three of those columns it's the in-crowd when you're rolling in the circles I live in Washington DC when you're rolling in those circles and you're at the cocktail parties there is no dissent it is like having a sea of bobbleheads on the dashboard of your car going down a dirt road they're all just going up and down like yes yes yes yes yes so when you go to some place look every four years they go to Iowa all these journals they pat themselves on the back as heroes because they went to a diner in Iowa and had a talk with a real human being then they immediately go back to New York or DC take a Silkwood shower delouse and then live for four years telling everybody about how their trip to the zoo in Iowa visiting real people to the elite from the coast the country in the middle the middle of the country is nothing but the place their chemical toilets jettison on their private jets as they go out to LA that's a good it's a good metaphor for what they do in their commentary and punditry that's the mentality out there they believe they are the smartest and the best and the brightest because they have a little badge that hangs on their lapel with their picture on it that gets them into places the general public can't go having worked in that business I can tell you you don't have to be a genius you don't have to be a rocket scientist to get a media credential it doesn't imbue you with any special knowledge and as we see every last night Rachel Maddow crying on television I wonder how many onions they had to cut to make that happen mr. I take some offense because I am her but you're absolutely right she has a tone she had two settings off and sarcastic and suddenly they upgraded her to 3.0 and they added tear yes good I don't know that's good I heard the new version has an emojis too so that because it's an upgrade you know the you're so right to about that talking about it for the next three or four years they say I was in Ohio they write about it like Thomas Friedman every single Thomas Friedman column you know I was on a bus in Beirut and I talked to somebody that's how they write about Ohio and I'm like it's Jack Kerouac on the road they come back and they publish their journals like they've cured cancer when all they did was talk to a real human being who doesn't have an advanced degree in 1940's bisexual polar bear studies real people with real jobs who get dirt under their nails you know and don't have a manicurist to get it out that's right now do you that you cite in the book later on in the book you cite at Lyndsey's stone she was that girl at Arlington Cemetery and she took a picture in front of the Unknown Soldier and it said please be quiet or don't yell or something and she was flipping the bird and pretending to yell she wasn't really yelling you know this picture went on Facebook people got a little angry and then the media blew it up they said oh there's outrage even though there was only outrage after after they posted the picture right this girl she lost her job she got death threats rape threats all of this I mean you really feel bad for the girl by the end of the episode it is there any end to this or we mean it just seems so mean like people are just out to get each other and there's no grace and there's no forgiveness do you see our culture turning a corner or is there only gonna get worse I think it's only gonna get worse because I don't know how to dial it back honestly I'm not saying that to be funny I for it to be turned down on the left we saw yesterday the Secretary of Homeland Security chased out of a restaurant because of who she is an angry mob came in and chanted her out of it it would take democratic leadership not tolerating that from their base but with an election around the corner there's no way they can't not tolerate that from their base because bass is all they have on a slow news day an average person can be destroyed by an angry journalist bored and looking for a scalp right on a regular news day they all suffer from Trump Tourette's they mentioned the president's name and that Nazi Hitler they just immediately freaked out mention Ronald Reagan to a committed leftist the man's been dead for a decade more than a decade been out of the White House almost 30 years and they will go off as if he had just run over their dog and is right in their driveway they do not forget I've written a column about this they do not forgive it's they don't want to defeat you they want to destroy you yeah that is how they work and when you're dead they're still going to come after you if you make the only sin and liberal them and that is thinking wrong and disagreeing with them that's exactly right that's such a good point I gotta let you go I've taken up enough of your time but it's such a good point and the book is so so fun to read it's right that's really a great read beginning earth will be destroyed in three thousand years if you don't buy this book today so keep that in mind it will don't have that blood on your hands people outrage ink how the liberal mob ruined science journalism in Hollywood by Derek hunter Derek thank you for being here thank you so unless that actually is the perfect segue because it is the question of do something yell scream we have to do something this is Chesterton's fence and this is Chesterton's fence getting ten feet higher under the barack obama administration because that's all the democrats who they say they see these kids at the border even though they've been coming through for years and years and years they're now the trump administration is actually following the law enforcing the law that was supported by Democrats and and some Republicans alike and they say just whatever do something other than this do something and do something is what people who don't know what to do say that's a that's you remember that kid from Broward County David Hogg he it's hard to forget because he's on CNN every 15 minutes he would say we have to do something and said what do you want to do he'd say something how about something have you guys considered doing something because that's what I suggest we do this is a right now Donald Trump is talking a possible executive order to stop these separations the executive order would violate the law it would violate the load be in violation of federal law and then what then what's gonna happen do you think the Democrats will say okay good job Trump no they're gonna yell at them for violating the law they're like there is no dealing with these people seriously they are not honest brokers they're not being honest actors here Rachel Maddow wasn't crying when Obama did far worse to these same people than Donald Trump is doing it is all just a scheme and people shouldn't fall in for it on the doing something Chesterton's fence gestured GK Chesterton the great writer who we reference on the show all the time he he put this very well he said quote in the matter of reforming things as distinct from deforming them there is one plain and simple principle a principle which will probably be called a paradox there exists in such a case a certain institution or law let us say for the sake of simplicity a fence or gate erected across a road the more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says I don't see the use of this let us clear it away to which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer if you don't see the use of it I certainly won't let you clear it away go away and think then when you come back and tell me that you do see the use of it I may allow you to destroy it Chesterton's fence people who go up they say this must be crazy I don't understand why this law exists I don't understand why this rule exists well if you don't then I'm certainly not gonna let you change it because you don't understand anything right I'll only let you change it you can tell me why it exists and why it should be changed and how changing it will make it better this is the issue of this policy because the alternative is putting kids in jail that's the alternative to this policy what would you rather do would you rather put kids in jail and with their parents but they're in jail indefinitely little toddlers in jail indefinitely or would you rather have them in facilities that are run by HHS and have their parents in jail just like in America when a when a parent goes to jail for committing any crime in America the kids are somewhere else the kids don't go to jail with their parents the parents rob a bank the kids don't go to jail with them right so you could do that or the old which the democrats want is to just let the kids go free and let the parents go free with them and stop prosecuting parents that's what they really really want this I'm getting there's breaking news now I sound like I'm Rachel Maddow Donald Trump President Trump did sign the order to end family separation we're gonna have to parse how exactly that went this is being reported by the LA Times I was gonna do it I think we all knew this was coming it just was such bad optics but it's not a smart move to play into the Democrats demands here it's not good to take their premises I will have to parse and see exactly what this executive order does because there are only going to be more problems down the road if this violates the law which it is hard to imagine that it won't the Democrats are not gonna let up on this but there were beyond the executive order that's not really the main issue here beyond the executive order there are three bills being proposed three pieces of legislation to address this issue because the executive order is just a patch right they'll say okay we're gonna stop enforcing the law well it's gonna come from that then you're gonna GL kids or you're gonna let the kit or the parents go either way you're gonna have trouble three bills being proposed Senator Dianne Feinstein Paul Ryan and Ted Cruz to Senate bills one one from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan the Feinstein bill bans the separation of families that's its violation of the law possibly like this executive order this was articulated very well by a congressional intern the other day as president Trump was walking in here it is that's one of the most articulate Democrats I've heard from Congress that's a congressional intern yelling as the president walk through the Capitol that's basically what Dianne Feinstein's bill means it's just you know screw you mr. president then the Paul Ryan bill allows the kids to be jailed from more than 20 days so they won't be separated but then you go you've got kids basically in jail I don't I don't know that that's a great solution then there's the cruise bill the cruise bill is pretty good because the cruise bill addresses the immigration issue it doubles the number of immigration judges and expedites proceedings it expedites deportation so that it won't be an issue to separate the kids because it'll all be done before the statutory minimum or the statutory maximum of how long kids can be held in custody that seems like a great idea of course Senate Democrats are gonna say no because they don't actually want to fix the problem they just want to demagogue there's some bad news here there is some bad news for the culture is really I don't know how the GOP is gonna get get past this because of this big issue the GOP has lost a fake Republican a fake Republican strategist here his Steve Schmidt he was the head of the McCain campaign for president here it is here is what GOP strategist Steve Schmidt has to say I said they don't feel guilty about being a Republican I've always been a Republican my father is his father was the whole family's Republican family I voted for Dwight Eisenhower the first time I ever voted I voted for Nixon the last time but when we come to senator Goldwater now it seems to me we're up against a very different kind of a man this man scuse me now maybe I'm wrong a friend of mine has said to me listen just because a man sounds a little irresponsible during a campaign doesn't mean he's going to act irresponsibly you know that theory that the White House makes the man I don't buy that I mean when the head of the Ku Klux Klan when all these weird groups come out in favor of the candidate of my party either they're not Republican sir I'm not I thought about just not voting in this election just staying home but you can't do that because that's that's saying you you don't care who wins and and I do care I think my party made a bad mistake in San Francisco and I'm gonna have to vote against that mistake on the 3rd of November vote for President Johnson on November 3rd the stakes are too high for you to stay home oh that wasn't Steve Schmidt that was the same trick that Democrats have been playing on Republicans for ever including all the way back in the LBJ election so Steve Schmidt what are we gonna do I mean what is the GOP gonna do we have just lost these chief strategist for the McCain for president campaign I mean this we have just lost one of the worst GOP strategists ever who ran a campaign that literally suspended itself just for no reason that campaign that made it an important point to say nice things about Barack Obama the opponent that that campaign that guy what does the GOP gonna do how are we ever going to keep losing elections if we don't have Steve Schmidt now we're gonna have to start winning elections that'll be terrible that'll cut against this squishy strategy that the GOP has embraced at various times Steve Sherman he's a total squish he he would frequently invoke that that phrase country over party which is a meaningless phrase by the way they always say that when people want to attack their own political party it's usually just Republicans who do this they say country over party and if that's an actual dichotomy that's not a dichotomy the reason I'm a Republican is because the Republican agenda is better for the country much better than the Democratic Enda so I'm a Republican for my country I choose my party because of my country there is no world in which you have a dichotomy between your party in your country it just means you're not a member of that party I don't say country over democrat party I'm a Republicans country over the party that I'm not in okay right duh that's why it's a party that's why you're in that party so Steve Schmidt I mean you actually could trace his tweet storm leaving the GOP point by point to that video that LBJ put out the Democrat campaign for president he he follows an almost point by point Steve Steve Schmidt by the way Steve Schmidt is a guy he's such a swish that he actually wrote an amicus brief to the Supreme Court on the gay marriage issue because he wanted the Supreme Court by judicial Fiat to radically redefined marriage that's how radical de sky is but he came out he tweeted quote 29 years and nine months ago I registered to vote and became a member of the Republican Party founded in 1854 to oppose slavery and stand for the dignity of human life today I renounce my membership in the party it's the party of Trump it is corrupt indecent and immoral with the exception of a few governor's like Baker Hogan and Kasich okay kids keep going it is filled with feckless cowards who disgrace and honor the legacies of the party's greatest leaders the child's separation policy which was signed under President Bush and which Barack Obama enforced and you never talked about it then is connected to the worst abuses of humanity in our history it's connected by the same evil that separated families during slavery and dislocated tribes and broke up Native American families I'm sorry hold on just one second I have to pop open my tumblr just collect mmm good that's good I'll go on it is immoral and must be repudiated our country's in trouble our politics are badly broken the first step to a season of renewal in our land is in the absolute and utter repudiation of Trump and his violin a blurs by electing Democratic majorities and there it is there it is folks this been building for a very long time for Steve Schmidt he's been waiting for the opportunity to just publicly endorse a bunch of Democrats he goes on who cares what he says right it's all just ridiculous nonsense I ego you know he invokes Ronald Reagan blah blah blah they've disgraced our country blah blah blah vote for Democrats that's what he says even you I do want to point out he uses the word Fidelity's he says this independent voter will be aligned with the only party left in America that stands for what is right and decent and remains fidelity to our Republic he could have said faithful which is like the right word to use there but Fidelity's because he's so grandiose is so flowery okay that's fine that's fine Steve I hope I hope we can make it without you I hope this is gonna be really frustrating if we have to start winning campaigns now instead of losing them all the time and apologizing to our opponents but Bob I see yet this always happens the squishes always leave it's been going on for a very long time the hysteria knows no bounds I will explain by the way exactly the answer you need to give whenever Democrats or squishy Republicans say stuff like this or they accused Trump of being a Nazi or whatever I'm gonna explain exactly your response but I got a say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube we only got a little bit here left if you're

family we'll be right back with the answer to all of those Nazi accusers we'll be right back okay so we saw Steve Schmidt's little temper tantrum this happens with other fake Republicans too it's all the Republicans who go on MSNBC and all they do is either lose campaigns or no one's ever heard of them until they went on MSNBC like Anna Navarro you know Anna Navarro has never done anything to help the Republican Party ever and but then she goes on MSNBC and she's the Republican strategist which is Republican strategist is another way of saying somebody who was here who would come on the show somebody who hit who can talk on camera there right that's what that's all that means so but you've heard the hysteria ginned up like crazy especially over this immigration thing they say Trump is a Nazi and this is what Nazis do and he's Hitler and he's a Nazi a Vox this is a headline from Vox Jeff Sessions tries to beat back Nazi comparisons gets literally everything wrong from The Guardian Melania Trump's former immigration lawyer compares border crisis to Nazi Germany and slave trade and then not to be outdone here's Newsweek ice director uses Nazi defense to claim border policy is not like Hitler regime we're just following orders okay I get the sense that all these people these major outlets these are not fringe people right these are major outlets on the Left they're all comparing Donald Trump and his administration to Hitler and the Nazis this raises a serious question because there were only two options here one there these people are being hysterical and disingenuous and nobody actually thinks that Donald Trump is Hitler or his administration or Nazis that's one option or they actually think that these guys are Nazis and in order to fight against the Nazis they're perfectly willing to tweet a little bit and wear pink hats imagine these people I mean actually imagine this for a second if you thought that Hitler had just taken power in the country and then you didn't do anything about it and then you just thought oh yeah you actually thought that there was a regime in power now that's about to start murdering millions and millions of people overtaking our neighbors invading Canada and Mexico and Poland I don't know and deporting you know people and murdering people and genocide and all of these awful horrendous evil things and then you said in response to that I'm going to tweet and nothing else that's all I'm gonna do those people would be work those people would be worse than Hitler right they would be Vichy Americans they would be people what's the line they say all that it takes for evil to prevail us for good men to do nothing they're people who were doing less than nothing right hey look it's Hitler if you know the thought experiment if you could kill baby Hitler would you kill him there like they see adult Hitler he's like walking right by the mic Wow Hey look baby Hitler well but that I mean it's so so obviously they're disingenuous nobody thinks this guy's actually Hitler but you should point out to them if you actually think he's Hitler you're abetting Nazis you're allow it you're just standing idly by while the Nazis wreak havoc and destruction and evil on the world so good job fishy good job fishy American but obviously that's not the case people are being totally disingenuous and that nobody actually thinks that which is why people are ignoring the mainstream media in the in the few minutes before we have to go here I'll just I will just point that out everything is getting better in this country and that's why they're being so hysterical even you know I I feel like this could be a daily segment things that are getting better today because every day there's something new we have out now Millennials are finally moving out of their parents house so during the Obama era there's kept living with their parents at greater and greater numbers in 2017 that number finally started to tick down so thirty one point five percent of Millennials are currently living with their parents that number is pretty high I think the standard number of people in that age group living with parents is about 28% that number is pretty high but it finally ticked down from 32 percent so the number is finally turning why I don't because the country is getting better and people are making more money and people are finally more employed we have virtually zero unemployment right now we have more open jobs than people looking for jobs we and by the way the in defense of the Millennials they do have a trillion and a half dollars of student loan debt and they got basically nothing for it they got these awful fake education degrees you know they've they got these degrees but they didn't learn anything in college and certainly no useful skills and not in serious and liberal arts or liberal education for the Millennials to the wages that they're earning are lower than their parents were earning at the same age they're actually significantly lower like 20% lower in 2013 the the average millennial earnings were about $40,000 a little bit more boomers their parents earned inflation adjusted over 50,000 at that same age so they actually do have a little tough but finally after the Obama malaise the economy is doing better and they're moving out of their parents house that's very good Millennials are the largest generation in the workforce right now 35 percent so we should hope that they can afford their own apartment right now it just came out from the National Association of Manufacturers over 95 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future they say things are going well and things are getting better that it's the highest number ever recorded from that Association record-breaking numbers why because things are going well disability claims are way down this one's amazing because when the economy is bad all of a sudden people start to get disabled that's really weird you know you say oh gosh how did that did that economy come crashing down on you and broke your back or something and people file these bogus disability claims and they start getting on the government dole because they can't get any work and they don't really want to work and everything's just boring and sad two years ago from the Social Security disability fund analysts said that that fund would run out by 2023 which is coming up pretty close because there were so many people on it during the Obama economy now the analysts are changing their tune they're saying it won't be depleted until 2032 and actually we might have more good news it might even be even later because people aren't using it because they're getting work they're getting jobs the country is doing better and what's happening Rachel Maddow is crying what does Rachel Maddow crying about is she crying about the kids being detained because their parents their criminal parents entered the country illegally and subjected them to this horrible situation no she's not crying about that because then she would have been crying about it when it was much worse in 2014 under Obama she's not crying about that at all Rachel Maddow is crying because things are going so so well and her side is losing because of it because her side offered nothing but failure and malaise and division and America has finally turned a corner things are going well and what's gonna happen your tumblr is gonna fill up so kodály wired I'll make sure you have it I'll just be here sipping on this for the rest of the day
