1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,549
>>TRUMP HAS PROPOSED HIS LATEST
VERSION OF IMMIGRATION REFORM,

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,580
AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT EXTREME
REPUBLICANS, EXTREME

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,990
CONSERVATIVES, WON'T LOVE, AND
IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT THOSE

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,370
ON THE LEFT MIGHT NOT
NECESSARILY BE IN FAVOR OF.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,370
LET

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,220
ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS, BUT
BEFORE I DO SO, JUST REMEMBER

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,340
THAT TRUMP'S INITIAL PROPOSAL
ASKED FOR ABOUT 2 BILLION IN

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,250
FUNDING FOR HIS BORDER WALL, HIS
LATEST PROPOSAL ASKS FOR 25

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,260
BILLION FOR HIS BORDER WALL.

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,070
WHAT HE'S DOING IS HOLDING THE

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,680
DREAMERS HOSTAGE, AND LETTING
THE DEMOCRATS KNOW THAT IF THEY

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,300
WANT PROTECTIONS FOR THESE
DREAMERS THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,680
TO CONCEDE, AND KNOWING
DEMOCRATS THEY PROBABLY

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,410
LIKELY WILL DO SO.

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:59,200
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS --

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:07,119
>>HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE THESE
DREAMERS TO BECOME CITIZENS,

17
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,890
SHOULD THIS VERSION OF
IMMIGRATION REFORM PASS?

18
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,890
WELL --

19
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,869
>>NOW --

20
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:26,730
>>THERE HAVE BEEN ESTIMATES
INTO HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO

21
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,280
BUILD A WALL, AND EXPERTS SAY IT
WOULD COST ABOUT 19 TO 20

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,950
BILLION, SO THE EXTRA 5 BILLION
WOULD BE USED HIGHER MORE BORDER

23
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,119
PATROL AGENTS AND ALSO INCREASE
SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL

24
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,689
SECURITY ALONG THE BORDER.

25
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,689
ALSO
--

26
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:58,670
>>AND OF COURSE HE WANTS TO
SCRAP THE LOTTERY SYSTEM WHICH

27
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,090
ALLOWS PEOPLE FROM COUNTRIES
WITH LOW LEVELS OF U.S.

28
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,090
IMMIGRATION TO APPLY FOR VISAS.

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,619
>>I THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS
A COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE THING TO

30
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:08,619
NEGOTIATE ON.

31
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,359
YOU CAN NEGOTIATE
ON THE WALL, IT'S STUPID, IT

32
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:14,590
WON'T BE EFFECTIVE, THE BORDER
IS ALREADY VERY MILITARIZED, AND

33
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,900
YOU COULD SAY MAYBE IT'S JUST A
PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT, WHATEVER,

34
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,609
TRADE WALL NONSENSE FOR LIVES.

35
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:22,799
BUT THEY HAVE BASICALLY

36
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:26,069
INTEGRATED A COMPLETE WISH LIST
OF EVERY FAR RIGHT DEMAND ON

37
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,069
IMMIGRATION IMAGINABLE.

38
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:28,520
AND BY
THE WAY, THOSE STANDARDS, SPELL

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,040
THEM OUT IN THE FUTURE, THOSE
STANDARDS WILL BE INCREDIBLY

40
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,779
STRINGENT AND POTENTIALLY MUCH
MORE RUTHLESS THAN WHAT IS

41
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:44,459
CURRENTLY SPELLED OUT. AND THE
OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT

42
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,129
I DON'T THINK WE CAN FRAME THIS
IN TERMS OF RIGHT AND MORE

43
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,279
MODERATE INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY ANYMORE.

44
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,739
I KNOW I HIT THIS

45
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,959
THEME A LOT, BUT I THINK THEY
MADE THE CHOICE THAT BOTH

46
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,779
ELECTORALLY AND WITH THEIR BASE
AND ALSO STRATEGICALLY, THEY ARE

47
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:03,950
DOUBLING DOWN ON WHITE IDENTITY
POLITICS, AND THIS TYPE OF

48
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,379
POLICY IS RACIST, IT WORKS WITH
THE BASE, IT'S ALSO STRATEGIC.

49
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,689
WHY DO THEY WANT TEXAS TO LOOK
LIKE COLORADO?

50
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:11,689
WHY DON'T THEY

51
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:16,469
WANT A MORE DIVERSE SOCIETY?

52
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:25,229
I
HAVE TO SAY, ELECTIONS MATTER.

53
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:26,229
I

54
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,540
LOATHED HILLARY CLINTON BUT THIS
IS WHY YOU PULL THE LEVER

55
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,809
ON THAT TYPE OF VOTE.

56
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,349
>>YOU JUST PISSED OFF A BUNCH OF
PEOPLE.

57
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:32,639
>>IT'S UNDENIABLY TRUE.

58
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,639
>>IT'S REALITY.

59
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:44,409
>>I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAID IN
REGARD TO VOTING, I DISAGREE

60
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:49,479
WITH ONE SMALL PORTION AND IT'S
THE BASE AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT

61
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,669
SOME OF THESE ISSUES.

62
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:54,639
THE BASE
UNDENIABLY WANTS TO BUILD THAT

63
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,359
WALL, THEY WANT TO GET RID OF
SOME FORMS OF IMMIGRATION,

64
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:02,200
INCLUDING THE LOTTERY SYSTEM AND
SOME OF THESE VISA PROGRAMS.

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
BUT

66
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,810
IF YOU POLL TRUMP SUPPORTERS
SPECIFICALLY, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

67
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,680
A SLIM MAJORITY SUPPORT
PROTECTIONS FOR THESE DREAMERS.

68
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,099
>>AND THAT IS THERE.

69
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,620
BUT NOT THE
OTHER STUFF, THEY ARE GETTING

70
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,358
RID OF THE LOTTERY AND
EVERYTHING ELSE.

71
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,669
>>MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU
MEANT, BUT THE POINT THAT I WANT

72
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:30,509
TO MAKE IS, A SLIM MAJORITY OF
TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE IN FAVOR OF

73
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:34,759
PROVIDING PROTECTION FOR THESE
DREAMERS, AND AS A WHOLE IN THE

74
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,479
COUNTRY, THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS.

75
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,479
THE

76
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,099
MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY ONCE
PROTECTIONS.

77
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:42,099
THE DEMOCRATS WERE

78
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:46,930
IN SUCH A GREAT POSITION IN THE
SENATE TO SUPPORT, OR NOT

79
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,860
SUPPORT, BUT TO REALLY FIGHT THE
REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE ON

80
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,080
THIS.

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,340
TO CONTINUE SAYING NO, WE
AREN'T GOING TO AGREE TO FUND

82
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,460
THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL YOU GIVE US
WHAT WE WANT.

83
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,699
AND THEY CAVED

84
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:03,770
IMMEDIATELY, BASED ON WHAT?

85
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,770
A
PROMISE?

86
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,770
>>THEY

87
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,310
FAILED STRATEGICALLY AND MORALLY
AND THAT IS THE CONSTANT THING.

88
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,050
>>SO WHERE IS MCCONNELL NOW?

89
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,840
HE
MADE A PROMISE, RIGHT?

90
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,060
>>BUT HE COULD SAY HE
MADE THE PROMISE.

91
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,509
OR The PROMISE, HERE WE GO, IT'S
A VOTE ON DACA.

92
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:21,580
>>THIS IS WORSE THAN THE
ORIGINAL VERSION.

93
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,169
>>THAT'S WHY SENATE DEMOCRATS
SAYING IT'S OKAY, MCCONNELL MADE

94
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,169
US A PROMISE, IT'S PREPOSTEROUS.

95
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:31,039
THEY ARE EITHER THE STUPIDEST

96
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,979
PEOPLE ALIVE, AND THEY MIGHT AS
WELL SCREAM THEY ARE A VERY

97
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:38,719
STABLE GENIUS ON TWITTER, OR
THEY KNOW THEY DON'T SUPPORT YOU

98
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:40,030
AND THEY DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT
YOU.

99
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,030
THEY ARE LIKE, MITCH

100
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,970
MCCONNELL WILL LATER BRING UP A
BILL.

101
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:43,970
THAT BILL COULD BE

102
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:49,289
TERRIBLE, BUT HEY, WE DID OUR
JOB, OUR FUNDERS ARE HAPPY, THE

103
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:54,719
MARKETS ARE STABLE, REPUBLICANS
GOT WHAT THEY WANTED, GOLLY

104
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:58,199
GEE THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD
DO FOR YOU AGAIN, BUT VOTE

105
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,389
FOR US IN THE NEXT ELECTION,
MAYBE WE'LL DO SOME THING RIGHT.

106
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,629
>>I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS AN
IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY, THEY COULD

107
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:13,360
BRING DREAMERS TO THE STATE OF
THE UNION, THEY COULD CALL PRESS

108
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,360
CONFERENCES EVERY DAY TO TALK
ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AT

109
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,229
THESE ATTENTION CENTERS, THERE
IS A MUCH BROADER CRISIS IN

110
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:25,199
TERMS OF DEPORTATION, FAMILIES
BEING BROKEN APART, AND THE VIEW

111
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,069
IS DOING A MORE EFFECTIVE JOB OF
USING THE LEVERS OF POWER AND

112
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:32,620
MEDIA ACCESS TO HIGHLIGHT THESE
ISSUES, AND EVEN GUYS I LOVE

113
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,330
LIKE BERNIE, THAT'S MY MAN, HE
COULD DO A LOT MORE IN

114
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,870
TERMS OF JUST EVEN HIGHLIGHTING
THE PROCESS AND ABUSES.

115
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,090
THEY HAVE FAILED STRATEGICALLY
AND MORALLY.

116
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,009
>>IF I WERE IN THE SENATE I
WOULD BE IN THE MEDIA ALL DAY

117
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:49,819
EVERY DAY TALKING ABOUT THE FACT
THAT TRUMP PROMISED THAT MEXICO

118
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,199
WILL PAY FOR THAT WALL.

119
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,430
WHY ARE
U.S. TAXPAYERS SPENDING $25

120
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,319
BILLION ON A WALL TRUMP SAID
MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR?

121
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,319
THAT'S

122
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,599
MONEY THAT SHOULD BE USED ON
IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE, MONEY

123
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,840
TO HELP FUND OUR SCHOOLS, TO
CREATE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR

124
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,279
YOUR CHILDREN.

125
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,150
THEY ARE SO BAD
AT FRAMING.

126
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,930
>>IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE PAID TO
LOSE, THEY ARE DEEPLY CORRUPT.

127
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,630
SEND ALISON HARTSON TO THE
SENATE AND SEE WHAT SHE DOES,

128
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:24,099
SEND PROGRESSIVES, THEY WILL
FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL EVERY DAY.

129
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:29,540
IN TERMS OF CLARITY, LET'S BE
CLEAR, REPUBLICANS WHO SAID THEY

130
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,330
WERE AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
BECAUSE THEY ARE FOR THE RULE OF

131
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,289
LAW WERE LYING, AND THEY JUST
PROVED THAT THEY WERE LYING.

132
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,939
THEY ARE AGAINST ALL IMMIGRANTS.

133
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,729
THEY JUST SAID I WILL TAKE AWAY

134
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:41,289
THE VISA LOTTERY FOR LEGAL
IMMIGRANTS.

135
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:42,289
WHAT THEY ARE

136
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:44,130
CALLING CHAIN MIGRATION,
SPONSORING FAMILIES TO COME

137
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,080
HERE, IS THE HEART OF LEGAL
MIGRATION.

138
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,400
>>IT'S NOT CHAIN MIGRATION, IT'S
FAMILY REUNIONS.

139
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,010
>>IF YOU TAKE THAT AWAY YOU
ALMOST KILL OFF IMMIGRATION.

140
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:00,659
THAT'S THE HEART OF LEGAL
IMMIGRATION.

141
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:01,659
BY THE WAY, THERE

142
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:03,749
IS THE MUSLIM BAN, THAT SHOULD
BE CALLED THE FAMILY BAN.

143
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,749
THEY

144
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:07,689
ARE NOW PROPOSING A FAMILY BAN
BECAUSE WHY?

145
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,389
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE

146
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,319
WHO COME IN THROUGH THE FAMILY
SITUATION, WHERE YOU COME IN

147
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,469
LEGALLY, ARE COMING FROM ASIA
AND LATIN AMERICA AND THEY

148
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:18,630
DON'T WANT THOSE PEOPLE IN THE
COUNTRY.

149
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,630
>>AND

150
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,129
THEY DON'T WANT THEM VOTING,
IT'S A FEATURE, NOT A BUG.

151
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:26,360
>>AND YOU MIGHT SAY REMEMBER,
PEOPLE WERE ALSO AGAINST THE

152
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,440
IRISH AND THE ITALIAN, BUT THAT
WAS ALSO RACIAL.

153
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
THAT WAS WHITE

154
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,169
PROTESTANTS AT THE TIME WHO
DIDN'T WANT CATHOLICS IN THE

155
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,169
COUNTRY.

156
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,169
OR BIGOTED.

157
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,909
AND THEY
VIEWED THE IRISH AND ITALIANS AS

158
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,509
DIRTY, THEY DIDN'T WANT THEM IN
THE COUNTRY.

159
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,510
THEY DIDN'T WANT

160
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,990
JEWS IN THE COUNTRY, SAME THING.

161
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,449
AND IT WAS ALSO BASED ON

162
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:46,449
POVERTY.

163
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:47,720
BUT THINK ABOUT THAT
FOR A SECOND, IT'S THE SAME

164
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,410
ARGUMENT THEY MAKE NOW.

165
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,370
MEXICANS
COME HERE, THEY DON'T HAVE JOBS,

166
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,100
THEY ARE DIRT POOR, ETC., BUT
THAT'S HOW WE BUILT THIS

167
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,740
COUNTRY.

168
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,780
WE DIDN'T BRING IN
IRISH AND ITALIAN MILLIONAIRES,

169
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:05,959
WE BROUGHT PEOPLE WHO CAME IN A
BOAT BECAUSE THEY WERE STARVING.

170
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:09,790
IRISH, ITALIANS, JEWS, GERMANS,
FRENCH, YES THE LATINOS, YES THE

171
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,290
ASIANS, YES THE BLACKS, WHO
BUILT THIS COUNTRY.

172
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,681
AND I THINK

173
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,870
THE LOTTERY WAS A WONDERFUL
PROGRAM, I WAS PLEASANTLY

174
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,790
SURPRISED WHEN THEY INSTALLED
THAT -- LOOK, I GET THAT

175
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,100
REPUBLICANS HATE THAT EVEN MORE
BECAUSE IT'S A SLIGHTLY NEWER

176
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,381
PROGRAM, FAMILIES COMING HERE
AND SPONSORING THE REST OF THEIR

177
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:36,040
FAMILY IS WHAT WE'VE DONE
FOREVER IN IMMIGRATION IN

178
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,730
AMERICA.

179
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,899
BUT THE LOTTERY MAINLY
HELPS AFRICAN COUNTRIES.

180
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,990
AND THEY DON'T WANT THAT AT ALL.

181
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,279
>>BECAUSE THEY GET THOSE
ADVANCED DEGREES AND THOSE

182
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,200
HIGH-PAYING JOBS, WE DON'T WANT
ANY PART OF THAT.

183
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,680
>>THE NIGERIANS ARE A HUGE
PERCENTAGE OF HARVARD, YOU DON'T

184
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,820
KNOW THAT, IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOU
ARE PROBABLY GOING RIGHT, RIGHT,

185
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,750
BUT NIGERIANS HAVE
DISPROPORTIONATELY BEEN VERY

186
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,410
SUCCESSFUL IN HIGHER EDUCATION
IN AMERICA BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT

187
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,990
THE PROPAGANDA THAT YOU HEAR ON
TV, SO ARE WE GOING TO SAY YES

188
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,209
TO KILLING OFF IMMIGRATION
OVERALL?

189
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:13,880
OF COURSE NOT. AND TO

190
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,100
ANA'S POINT, THE PREVIOUS
DEBATE, AND THIS IS HOW

191
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,720
REPUBLICANS MOVE THE GOALPOSTS
EVERY TIME, THE PREVIOUS DEBATE

192
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,880
WE JUST HAD LIKE FOUR DAYS AGO
WAS, DEMOCRATS WERE OFFERING

193
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,880
$1.6 BILLION FOR THE WALL AND
TRUMP WANTED MORE THAN TWO.

194
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
NOW

195
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,709
TRUMP SAYS IN RETURN FOR GIVING
YOU BACK THE HOSTAGES, THE

196
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:36,440
DREAMERS WHICH I TOOK HOSTAGE A
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, THEY WERE

197
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,890
FINE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, I
CHANGED IT SO I TOOK THEM

198
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,550
HOSTAGE AND I'M GOING TO THROW
THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY, IN

199
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,519
EXCHANGE FOR THAT I WOULD LIKE
25

200
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,700
BILLION FOR THE WALL AND I WOULD
LIKE TO KILL LEGAL IMMIGRATION.

201
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,269
>>AND I DON'T WANT TO QUICKLY
GO OVER WHAT YOU SAID, MICHAEL,

202
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:57,560
BECAUSE YOU MADE SUCH A GREAT
POINT THAT I THINK PEOPLE

203
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,750
FORGET, THERE IS A VERY SPECIFIC
REASON WHY THOSE ON THE RIGHT

204
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,190
WANT TO DO AWAY WITH LEGAL
MIGRATION.

205
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,329
YES, THERE IS A FORM

206
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:10,329
OF BIGOTRY BEHIND THE SCENES, A
FORM OF RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA

207
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:16,269
BEHIND THE SCENES, BUT I THINK
WHAT COMMENCES PEOPLE TO DO AWAY

208
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,410
WITH SO-CALLED CHAIN MIGRATION
AND ALL OF THIS, THEY DON'T WANT

209
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,520
THESE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR
DEMOCRATS AND THEY ARE VERY

210
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,100
TRANSPARENT ABOUT THAT.

211
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,660
RECENTLY
VICE DID A SPECIAL WHERE THEY

212
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:35,230
HAD A REPUBLICAN POLLSTER DO A
FOCUS GROUP WITH TRUMP VOTERS,

213
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,310
THEY WANTED TO SEE HOW THEY FEEL
ABOUT TRUMP'S FIRST YEAR IN

214
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,310
OFFICE.

215
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,010
THE MAJORITY WERE
SUPPORTIVE.

216
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,010
AND WHEN THEY WERE

217
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,709
TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION ONE
WOMAN SAID WE CAN'T KEEP

218
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,779
ALLOWING THESE PEOPLE TO COME
INTO THE COUNTRY, I'M

219
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:52,360
PARAPHRASING BY THE WAY, AND
VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS.

220
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,580
>>IT IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH VOTER
ID LAWS AND THE VOTING RIGHTS

221
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,470
ACT, AND THIS STUFF IS STRATEGY.

222
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,759
IT'S NOT JUST ETHICS, WE COULD

223
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,600
CONDEMN IT ETHICALLY BUT IT'S
ALSO STRATEGY.

224
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
THE SAME WAY THAT

225
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,350
WE NEED TO ACT ETHICALLY AND
ALSO STRATEGICALLY, BECAUSE A

226
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,199
MORE DIVERSE COUNTRY IS
ADVANTAGEOUS OR LEFT-WING

227
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,800
CANDIDATES.

228
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,610
>>THAT IS THE BIGGEST PART OF
THE NOVEMBER ELECTION, WAS

229
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,670
ALLOWING JEFF SESSIONS TO BE THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED

230
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:28,920
STATES, AND EMBOLDEN ALL OF
THESE GUYS WHO CLAIM VOTER FRAUD

231
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,920
AND ARE STRIKING PEOPLE FROM THE
ROLLS, AND MORE THAN THAT, THEY

232
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,620
ARE KEEPING PEOPLE AND THEIR
KIDS OFF THE ROLLS.

233
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,620
>>TERRORIZING PEOPLE.

234
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,389
>>WHAT WE DO LIKEWISE?

235
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:43,980
IF WE
THOUGHT THERE WAS A GROUP OF

236
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,900
IMMIGRANTS THAT WERE MORE LIKELY
TO VOTE REPUBLICAN, FOR EXAMPLE

237
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,709
FROM COUNTRIES THAT
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE RIGHT-WING

238
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:51,709
LEADERS.

239
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:52,709
THE PHILIPPINES --

240
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:55,819
>>THEY WOULD BE FLEEING THOSE
LEADERS BUT OKAY.

241
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:59,810
>>I THINK DUTERTE IS DOING SUCH
A GREAT JOB, I'M GOING TO

242
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,580
GO TO AMERICA.

243
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,430
>>I'M MAKING IT UP, PEOPLE
COMING FROM THE PHILIPPINES ARE

244
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,089
NOT NECESSARILY RIGHT WING, I'M
JUST PICKING COUNTRIES WITH

245
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,589
RIGHT-WING LEADERS.

246
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:13,850
INDIA HAS A
RIGHT WING LEADER, RUSSIA

247
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,930
OBVIOUSLY.

248
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,860
WOULD DEMOCRATS SAY
THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE

249
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,940
REPUBLICAN, OR PROGRESSIVES, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT DEMOCRATIC PARTY

250
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,560
LEADERS WOULD DO, WOULD
PROGRESSIVES SAY LET'S BAN

251
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,770
INDIANS AND FILIPINOS AND
RUSSIANS FROM ENTERING THE

252
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,720
COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY MIGHT VOTE
AGAINST US?

253
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
NO, BECAUSE WE ARE

254
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,899
MORE MORAL THAN THE RIGHT WING,
WHO ARE DEEPLY IMMORAL.

255
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,899
WHETHER

256
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,210
YOU THINK THAT IMMORALITY IS
BASED ON THEIR GREED FOR POWER,

257
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,740
AND A DEMOCRACY THOSE PEOPLE
MIGHT VOTE AGAINST US SO I WILL

258
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,209
KEEP THEM FROM THE AMERICAN
DREAM BECAUSE OF MY PERSONAL

259
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:51,529
LUST FOR POWER, WHETHER YOU
THINK IT'S BASED ON THAT OR

260
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:54,800
BASED ON OLD-SCHOOL RACISM, I
DON'T WANT PEOPLE FROM THOSE

261
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,510
COUNTRIES, OR ITS CLASSISM, I
DON'T WANT POOR PEOPLE IN THE

262
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,680
COUNTRY EVEN THOUGH THEY BUILT
THE COUNTRY FROM ALL THE

263
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,910
DIFFERENT RACES.

264
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,949
NONE OF IT IS A
MORAL STANCE.

265
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:05,000
THE MORAL STANCE

266
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,870
IS WE LOVE AND BELIEVE IN THE
CONCEPT OF AMERICA AND WE

267
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,790
BELIEVE IN WHAT THE STATUE OF
LIBERTY SAYS, THAT GREAT POEM ON

268
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,100
THAT STATUE STANDS FOR ALL OF
US, AND THAT NO MATTER WHO YOU

269
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,629
ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR WE WANT
YOU IN THIS COUNTRY IF YOU ARE

270
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:23,129
HUNGRY ENOUGH AND WANT TO WORK
HARD ENOUGH TO COME HERE

271
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,520
FOR A BETTER LIFE.

272
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,529
>>CENK, MORE THAN THAT, I'M
CONFIDENT IN MY BELIEFS.

273
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:30,529
I DON'T

274
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,399
FEEL LIKE I NEED TO RIG THE
SYSTEM TO MY ADVANTAGE.

275
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,399
I WANT

276
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,580
TO LIVE IN A FREE SOCIETY, FREE
MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS, AND NOT

277
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,509
HAVE TO RIG A SYSTEM OR RIG A
DEMOCRACY IN ORDER TO SUIT MY

278
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,160
AGENDA AND MEET MY AGENDA.

279
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,720
AND
THAT'S WHAT THE RIGHT WING DOES

280
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,760
TIME AND AGAIN.

281
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,250
>>WE WANT EVERYBODY TO VOTE AND
WE WANT IT TO BE AS EASY AS

282
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,250
POSSIBLE.

283
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,310
>>I WANT TO THANK CENK FOR THAT
AMAZING MONOLOGUE BECAUSE I WAS

284
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,029
JUST ABOUT TO SAY YES WE WOULD,
I'M GLAD YOU STOPPED ME.

285
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,029
THEY

286
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,129
WANT TO COME VOTE FOR
REPUBLICANS?

287
00:15:02,129 --> 00:00:00,000
OF COURSE NOT.
