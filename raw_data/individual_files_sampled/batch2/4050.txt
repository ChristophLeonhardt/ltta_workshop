well with us now is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee Democratic senator Chris Coons of Delaware good to have you on board why don't we get your thoughts on the breaking news first well this is encouraging this suggests that diplomacy can be the follow-on to confrontation I'll remind you we still don't have an ambassador to South Korea that's a problem I remain concerned about the functionality of the State Department there was reporting I think just yesterday by the New York Times that a hundred and twenty million dollars that was supposed to be dedicated to pushing back against Russia hasn't been spent in fact they don't even have Russian speakers in that is there any pressure that the legislative branch can put on the White House to get them to start filling these key these key roles whether it's an ambassadorship to South Korea or the dozens of others said that remain vacant well that's a challenge for us because we need to work in a bipartisan way as several of us are sending a joint communication to secretary Tillerson saying we demand that you spend the money that we've appropriated to you for this purpose did you do but it's McConnell what what about I know Lindsay is with you guys sometimes it is Mitch McConnell want South Korea to have a US ambassador does Mitch McConnell want the United States to have ambassadors in other parts of the world that are flashpoints I don't think the holdup on confirming an ambassador has been in the Senate I think the holdup has been nominating somebody who is appropriate and competent there was a solid nominee a few weeks ago he's been withdrawn it's unclear to me why it's taken so Mike we have like lots of laundry I don't have a bath what pressure can the legislative branch put on the executive branch on the president distant well let's just keep it simple to name an appropriate ambassador to South Korea two things if we can speak in a bipartisan way if we can be forceful public and bipartisan about we think the threats against North Korea may have succeeded in getting their attention but diplomacy has always been the preferred route to resolve this confrontation with North Korea so my question is and president reason be partisan reason why brother Mitch McConnell do you think Mitch McConnell would get in the way of that I hope not I think it's been a challenge here keeping Republicans in leadership in our Senate focused on foreign policy they've had other priorities tax reform confirmation of judges I understand that but the confrontation with South Korea and our critical fight against Russia particularly in preparation for the 2018 elections is something that should get strong bipartisan support the idea that we haven't funded security for state election systems when we are eight months now from general election this November really not strikes as something that we should be moving forward willie geist it's willie Geist here in New York on the topic of North Korea we should also point out that just last week the State Department's top diplomat on North Korea Joseph Hyun resigned he said it was for personal reasons but the timing was curious too a lot of people what would be in a conventional administration a conventional State Department the appropriate action right now you have this moment where South Korea has reached out North Korea's agreed to a meetings they said we'll have a heart-to-heart sit-down with the United States what should happen in your eyes from right now in a conventional administration significantly stepped up diplomacy coordinating efforts with Japan with South Korea with China even engagement with Russia to try and put together an international effort that would get clarity about what this opening to get a deal on the table and to get it done I'll remind you in the last administration in confronting a reckless and threatening nuclear program in Iran they did succeed in putting together a multilateral effort that included our European allies as well as China and Russia to get searching nuclear inspections and to get Iran to give up their nuclear stockpile there are some challenges with that deal it still needs to be improved but that's the sort of engagement with our allies through diplomacy that should be possible and should be taken at this moment think they'll happen here I remain hopeful but you know given the recent record of the State Department under secretary tell erson it doesn't seem to me that they've been able to mount the kind of diplomatic initiative that this opening demands Jim VandeHei senator you have your own gun control legislation sitting for the Senate it feels from afar that the more we get removed from the actual shootings the less of a chance there is that anything significant is going to get done like what's your feel when you're talking to Republicans in particular in the Senate now first I was pleased that Senator Toomey joined with me and introducing yesterday a bill that would make sure that the hundred and twenty thousand Americans a year who are prohibited from getting guns who go into a gun store and lie and try to purchase a gun will be those efforts will be followed up on by state and local law enforcement this is just strengthening the enforcement of existing laws I've got three teenagers at home I don't know about the rest of the country but the upcoming March 24 event here in Washington where I think we're going to see hundreds of thousands of young people from around the country follow up on the call of the parkland Florida high school students is going to be a galvanizing event Mike Barnicle so senator we have a tenuous at very positive and optimistic development and career at least they're talking but do you worry are you concerned at all that an undisciplined president could tweet something that would just derail whatever is going on over there absolutely that's what we've seen over the last year is that a candidate Trump who said that he would be unpredictable has performed spectacularly in that category he has been completely unpredictable that dust-up with his own party over his tariffs decision and the seeming lack of coordination within his own administration over his tariffs announcement this week is just another example and I do think given his history of confrontation with North Korea through tweets and through personal insults and jives is exactly the sort of unconstructive ly unpredictable step that President Trump might now take I really hope he won't Senator Chris Coons thank you very much for being on the show again element Republican Senator Jeff Flake joins us here on set plus two years ago candidate Donald Trump told us in an interview that he would be neutral in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians it didn't seem that way when the president met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House yesterday New York Times Peter Baker has some new reporting on that he'll join the table as well Morning Joe is coming right back thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest
