THE STRONGEST SECRETARIES OF STATE WE'VE HAD. ACCORDING TO NEWS REPORTS, PASTOR BRONSON IS THAT 19TH PRISONER PERHAPS HOSTAGES THE RIGHT WORD FREED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. HERE HE IS PRAYING WITH THE PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE OVER THE WEEKEND TAKE A LOOK. I ASK THAT YOU POUR OUT YOUR HOLY SPIRIT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU GIVE HIM SUPERNATURAL WISDOM TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THE PLANS YOU HAVE FOR THIS COUNTRY. I ASK THAT YOU GET SOME WISDOM NOT TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY INTO RIGHTEOUSNESS. Sean: JOINING US NOW IS PASTOR BRONSON HIMSELF. I KNOW HOW MANY WORKED ON YOUR BEHALF YOU ARE HELD FOR 1818 MONTHS AND HAD NO REASON, NO UNDERSTANDING OF WHY AND WERE HELD IN A CELL DESIGNED FOR 8 AND THERE WERE 21 PEOPLE. CORRECT? PART OF THAT GAME IT WAS VERY CROWDED IN THAT CELL. IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME. I WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE I HAD NEVER CONSIDERED PRISON AS A POSSIBILITY AND THE COSTS FOR THAT. Sean: HOW WERE YOU TREATED? I WAS TREATED WELL BY THE PRISONERS I WAS WITH. Sean: THEY WERE NOT OF YOUR FAITH. THEY WEREN'T AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE DIFFICULT THINGS. I WAS ISOLATED BY CULTURE AND BY LANGUAGE BUT ESPECIALLY BY RELIGION. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO BE THE ONLY CHRISTIAN AMONG THEM. Sean: WHEN YOU FOUND OUT WHAT YOU WERE BEING HELD FOR WHICH WAS YOUR FAITH, WHAT DID YOU THINK? WHAT WAS SURPRISING IS THAT THEY TOLD ME I WAS BEING HELD FOR TERRORISM AND FOR TRYING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT. THE TRUTH IS IF WE HAD BEEN PREACHING JESUS CHRIST THAT'S WHY WE WERE IN TURKEY IS TO SHARE THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST WITH TURKS. WE DID THAT OPENLY AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. IT WAS VERY SHOCKING TO BE ACCUSED OF TERRORISM. AND IT CAME DOWN TO YOUR CHRISTIAN FAITH IN MANY WAYS. I THOUGHT YOUR PRAYER WAS EXTRAORDINARILY TOUCHING WITH THE PRESIDENT. WHAT WAS YOUR WORST MOMENT? I CAN IMAGINE WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR FREEDOM YOU LOSE EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, NOT KNOWING WHY YOU'RE BEING HELD. NOT HAVING ANYONE TO SHARE YOUR FAITH, YOUR VALUES WITH YOU, WHAT WAS YOUR LOWEST MOMENT? WHEN I WAS ARRESTED AND IT KEPT GOING ON AND ON, IT SEEMED THAT THERE WAS NO WAY OUT. I LOST A LOT OF HOPE. I BEGAN TO SEE THERE WAS VALUE IN MY SUFFERING ESPECIALLY AS TIME WENT ON. I SAW THAT MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD BEGAN PRAYING FOR ME AND I BEGAN TO SEE Sean: HOW DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT? MY WIFE, SHE WAS THE ONLY CONTACT I HAD WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD. SHE COULD VISIT ME FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR EVERY WEEK SPEAKING ON THE PHONE AND SHE WOULD BRING ENCOURAGEMENT TO ME AND TELL ME THAT PEOPLE WERE PRAYING FOR ME. AS I LEARNED THAT, I BEGAN TO SEE THAT GOD WAS INVOLVED IN US AND HE WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY SUFFERING. Sean: WHY DID YOU SAY IT AND THIS MORNING THAT I WAS ONE OF THE MOST HATED MAN IN TURKEY? I WAS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT, OF BEING ALIGNED WITH THE TERRORIST MOVEMENT, ALSO BEING PART OF THE PKK WHICH IS A GUERRILLA TERROR MOVEMENT. I WAS PLANED FOR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS TURKEY HAD. IF THERE ARE PROBABLY AREN'T TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO LIKE ME RIGHT NOW. Sean: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MOMENT THAT TOUCHED A LOT OF PEOPLE, YOU'RE A MAN OF GREAT FAITH AND OBVIOUSLY A STRONG CHRISTIAN AND YOU PRAYED FOR THE PRESIDENT LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT MOMENT. IT'S SOMETHING WE HAD HOPED TO BE ABLE TO DO. MY WIFE FOR AT SOME TIME WANTED TO PRAY SOME VERSES OVER HIM FROM ISAIAH, JUST ASKING FOR THE SPIRIT OF GOD TO COME UPON HIM. BEFORE WE WENT TO MEET HIM, WE LEARNED WE WOULD BE ABLE TO VISIT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WE ASK GOD TO GIVE A SET OPPORTUNITY TO PRAY FOR THE PRESIDENT. IT'S A GREAT PRIVILEGE I THINK MANY PASTORS WOULD LOVE TO DO I IT. OUR PRESIDENT NEEDS PRAYER. Sean: WE ARE GLAD YOU'RE HOME, IT WAS A VERY TOUCHING MOMENT. I THINK ALL OF US COULD USE MORE GOD IN OUR LIVES AND I THINK YOU IMPACT A LOT OF PEOPLE, WELCOME HOME, WERE GLAD TO HAVE YOU BAC BACK. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
