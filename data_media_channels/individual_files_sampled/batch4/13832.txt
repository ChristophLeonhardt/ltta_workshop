we're in the throes of Scilly season those delightful summer months when the mainstream media focus on frivolous news stories while everybody vacations here in the United States where there's no difference between the mainstream media and the Democrat Party it's lefty politicians and activists leading the silly season a gay male congressman rants about tampons a transgender left-wing activist calls the American flag racist and so not to be outdone CNN runs this shocked story of that one time president Trump politely asked for a coca-cola they've got him now or they've got him now unreported as Democrats fizz over silly season president Trump successfully negotiates a better trade deal with the EU he averts a trade war he compels NATO allies to pay their fair share for security and demonstrably he begins to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons but tampons and coca-cola that's the writ as the real story isn't it tampons and coca-cola then alley Stuckey drops by to discuss her nefarious fake news satire of baddie socialist Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and finally the mailbag I'm Michael Nolan this is the Michael Nolt show so much to get to today and actually of the gay male

century tampons before we load this we're talking about Sean Patrick Maloney he's from my home district of New York's 18th congressional district I have worked on campaigns against this guy at my company my political company that I founded regularly advises candidates who run against this guy I'm intimately involved with him without further ado Sean Patrick Maloney my office recently got smacked down by the powers that be in the house because we had the temerity to offer feminine hygiene products to the women who work for me by the way a majority of my staff is female and we have a million people come through our office and we provide things like paper towels or tissues or first-aid like band-aids supplies that people need and those are paid for by an office budgets pretty normal stuff but we were informed a couple days ago that we couldn't buy tampons and we thought that was crazy but I was supposed to write a $37 and 16 cent check to reimburse the house for those purchases because they were considered inappropriate and now the house Administration Committee which makes all these rules and it's controlled by the Republicans is lying about it and saying that's not their policy and I'm making it up Sean Patrick Maloney ladies and gentlemen tampons that's the big issue it's a big issue because there's nothing else that the Democrats can criticize right now everything is going too well on domestic affairs Foreign Affairs so they have to make this stuff up and I bring this up because I have known Shaun Maloney since I was I don't know 21 22 he when he first ran for Congress I was working on the campaign of the incumbent congresswoman and so I got to see him on the campaign trail all of the time and I got to tell you I have never seen a slicker politician than this guy is there have you ever seen just from that little video clip have you seen a smarmy err person in Congress I don't think so this guy talk about slick oily unctuous New York politics this guy was staff secretary to Bill Clinton guarding the Oval Office door well the interns were flitting about coming and going then he worked as if not to be outdone he worked for the most corrupt politicians in the country Eliot Spitzer that a creepy-looking former attorney general who was governor of New York and got caught doing really weird things with hookers for just tens of thousands of dollars a night really really bizarre and sick stuff he worked for him then he worked for another corrupt politician David Patterson then at one point his company I think he was advising Enron that didn't work out very well Benny goes down he's in con and now he's in Congress he's at New York's 18th congressional districts and he this year is simultaneously running for two offices at the same time hey you know this is this guy's career he's running for New York Attorney General at the same time that he's running for Congress in New York at New York's 18th congressional district and he's just he's just slick it's just all smarm and slickness he's focusing on tampons now because he thinks this is going to endear him to the women voters and to the left side of the Democrat Party he's running against a few women for attorney general in New York before he runs for Congress again and so he thinks this is going to endear him to to them tampons are not an office product right you don't like pens or an office product pencils or an office product maybe you need a tissue every now and again okay I can sort of see that tampons are not and he's making it out that tampons are some extraordinarily expensive thing people can't afford tampons tampons cost on average 19 cents per unit it is 19 cents a unit to have tampons yeah you know if the argument here is that people should have access to tampons they do have access to tampons if the argument here is that people should have tampons Gok sure people should also have lunch are you gonna buy everybody lunch people should have dinner of you know buy everybody dinner people should have a house or you gonna buy everybody a house no you can we have a free country luckily people are so prosperous in this country unemployment is at record lows prosperities at rect is is at record highs wages are increasing things are going very very well you can afford the 19 cents for your personal products there are a lot of personal products that I use that I Shaun Maloney doesn't pay for but he's just demagoguing on this because it's silly season and this guy is desperate for attention just like all congressmen are they jump I just had a congressman try to jump up in my Twitter mention stress start a little Twitter fight because they're all desperate for attention there were so many of them that they need to distinguish themselves somehow the reason I bring up Maloney too though is because unlike virtually all the other congressmen Shaun Maloney is pretty smart he most congressmen I met her just vacuous imbeciles but Maloney is smart he's not a stupid guy he is a craven crass politician all that he's interested in is his own ambition you know I don't I don't remember him raising the tampon issue when Democrats controlled the house I don't maybe he his office got free tampons then maybe they didn't who knows but he's just so crass and opportunistic I really you got to watch this guy and it's really fun to watch his race right now because when politicians ambition gets the better of them they run for two offices at the same time you know I this happens sometimes for president you'll have a sitting governor or sitting congressman or a sitting senator rather and you kind of understand that the president you know it's the big most important position but when these career guys are just jockeying for positions all they care about is the next move because he cuz Shaun Maloney thinks if he goes from Congress to Attorney General then he can go from Attorney General to governor and then governor to president I promise you that's the thinking in his mind but it's just so slick and pathetic I can't imagine that it works except we're in silly season so it is going to work that brings us to our next story which is the transgender left-wing activist Huffington Post blogger who thinks that the American flag is now racist racist white supremacist this is what he said so Jerry Jones the owner of the Dallas Cowboys has come out finally the owner of a football team he said players have to stand for the national anthem they don't get to take in me they don't get to sit it out they don't get to go do jumping jacks down the street they don't get to go buy a sandwich they stand toes on the line for the national anthem this is enough to make me a Cowboys fan I'm gonna become like Chris Christie you know a native New Yorker New Jersey you know kind of going over and becoming a Cowboys fan because that this is American this is a wonderful thing you should have to stand for the pledge of allegiance when you're playing football simple as that so this guy a Charles climber who's now he's transgender so now he goes by Charlotte climber radical left-wing activist blogger on The Huffington Post he he responds to this he says quote I was raised in Texas I've always loved football I've been a lifelong Cowboys fan and I will never again watch a Cowboys game so long as Jerry Jones's racist white supremacist pandering took us is the owner of the team his conduct is hate cowardly and embarrassing oh and what is that conduct respecting the flag that's what's hateful now that's rightful racist it's like cory booker this reminds me of cory booker who says if you put a regular normal judge on the court you're complicit in evil and you're a satan and it's evil it's a moral moment how exhausting it must be to be on the Left how utterly exhausting it must be to have everything because you can't just stop you can't stay at your regular normal stasis level of outrage you have to get progressively more outraged so now the suggestion is that respecting the flag is racism white supremacism hateful cowardice blah blah blah that voting for a judge which our elected representatives have done for the whole history of the country that's complicity and evil and Satan and Brora oh how exhausting I will point out though cuz some conservatives get this wrong this free speech issue on the flag protests at the national anthem they say well if we make the players in the NFL stand for the American flag then we're just like the anti free speech people they should have their free speech and free speech and free right okay right right right uh NFL players professional athletes do not have the right to do whatever they want on national television they don't have the right to break the rules athletes play a game that has rules one of the rules of the NFL is to stand and respect the national anthem and to respect the flag one of the rules at the Dallas Cowboys is that you don't get to disrespect the flag that's the rules the NFL players don't have the right to go onto the field and play baseball that would be but it's their free speech what if they want to play baseball it's a free country no they don't get to play baseball they have to do and it's and by the way sports are an entertainment event it's a TV show the NFL and it's at its core is a TV show right that's where virtually everybody who watches football watches it it's on TV and a TV actor does not have his free speech rights trampled on because the director makes him read from a script that's not but I want to say what I want to say you not respecting my free speech no there's a script because it's a TV show you die you can't that's not what free speech is so I think conservatives get this wrong a little bit you have to respect the flag the other reason you have to respect the flag is that it's the the flag is the symbol of the country in the country gives you your right to free speech it's an undercuts itself if you protest the country you're protesting your right to free speech it's a house divided against itself as Chesterton said there's a thought that stops thought and that's the only thought that ought to be stopped I've got to move on but there's a lot more you can say on that topic maybe we'll get to it a little bit in the mailbag now we've got to get to the most important news story they finally CNN The Washington Post Mashable then we've got the big scoop which is that one time a couple years ago get ready for I hope you're sitting there are you sitting down if you're if you're driving pull over please a couple years ago one time President Trump politely asked for a coca-cola he did he did it and I'm you know that I'm a defender of the president I he asked for a coca-cola politely folks that's what he did CNN here's the headline Trump caught on tape get me a coke please I kid you know that's a CNN Headline that's a real headline on their website Mashable get me a coke please people are losing it over this moment in the leaked Trump tape no they're not I didn't read the whole article they're not I'm willing to bet anything they're not Newsweek get me a coke please people are losing it over this moment in the trade seems repeated doesn't that seem like a similar story I know that nobody's losing it yes for Coke politely this is this is really how you know they're desperate they can't hit them on anything they tried to hit him on tariffs that's over we'll get to that in one second on the Coke in in the tape in the big crazy bombshell tape at one point stalking in : and then he says can you get me a coke please - assuming I assume it's his assistant outside this is this is a good example because what the media do is they take little jokes we'll talk to Allie Stuckey about this they take little jokes and they create take it seriously that bring it into a scandal or they take an offhanded comment which is nothing like asking for a coke they try to make that into a story because if you see a news headline you assume there is a story you would just assume so it said if it's in a news headline you'd think there's a news story but there isn't and in the the most obvious the most absurd version of this I've seen in the last week at least is it get me a coke please the other thing by the way I meant to point this out yesterday when you listen to that trump Cohan tape it it sounds like a David Mamet play I didn't realize how good a playwright David Mamet is he's the guy who wrote Glengarry Glen Ross until I heard that tape but it does sound like it goes oh well we're not talking are we talking mic nah we're not we're speaking whispers it a and get the good and the check and right and this is get me a coke please it's one of these just throw off things they're trying to make it into a crazy story meanwhile meanwhile all of this is going on the tampons and the and the coke and the flag is a racist or whatever meanwhile here's President Trump and the Commissioner of the EU here he is so we had a big day very big we met right here at the White House to launch a new phase in the relationship between the United States and the European Union a phase of close friendship of strong trade relations in which both of us will win this is why we agreed today first of all to work together toward zero tariffs zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non auto industrial goods thank you thank you thank you we will also work to reduce barriers and increase trade and services chemicals pharmaceuticals medical products as well as soybeans soybeans is a big deal and the European Union is going to start almost immediately to buy a lot of soybeans they're a tremendous market buy a lot of soybeans from our farmers in the Midwest primarily so I thank you for that gent load he goes on by the way there are also the Union is going to buy more liquefied natural gas possibly oil this is a big hit to Russia this is what Trump had been signaling for the last few weeks now it says why does Europe buy their oil and their gas from Russia they should do it from us and you're seeing the culmination of that in this conference today is a huge win we have been told now for weeks and weeks and months and months from all the smart set from Trump's detractors on the left and the right that President Trump II doesn't know what he is doing he's a crazy person only a crazy person would threaten tariffs on Europe only a crazy person would threaten our allies in NATO you know and criticize them and say they should pay more money only a crazy person would would negotiate with Kim jong-un and go over and have a summit with the leader of North Korea only a crazy person and yet what have we seen in the past week trade wars averted they've come to an agreement they said there they're just finalizing putting the finishing touches but they've come to an agreement no further tariffs they're going to work to eliminate all of the non auto tariffs that there currently are and the EU is gonna buy more soybeans that's good politically and it's good for America's farmers and they're going to buy more natural gas and possibly oil that's strategically quite important and another big win politically and for for American producers so we've been told that what else have we been told we've heard from the Secretary General of NATO that whereas four years ago only three allies the NATO allies were actually paying their fair share what they said they were gonna pay for defense spending they were looking forward this year they expect eight allies to do that I wonder why probably perhaps let's say it's because President Trump had the courage to say hey guys you're not paying what you're supposed to pay and you have to pay how about in North Korea looking over the Pacific right now you've got Kim jong-un we have satellite images demonstrating the Kim jong-un is dismantling his nuclear program now we've been told oh he's not going to do it he's faking don't believe Kim it's the worst thing ever to have the American president meet with Kim jong-un it's terrible it's a huge mistake looks like it's working there there are analysts now international intelligence analysts saying that the sites that are being dismantled right now launch sites factories bomb factories production facilities for space launchers they're being dismantled being ripped apart right now this is at least a gesture of goodwill and it's a step in the right direction I told you last time at the summit that we were in inning one now maybe we're in inning two moving in the right direction all of president Trump's critics who said he's a crazy person only a crazy person would do this they were proven wrong they've been proven wrong on every front this week and so I might just suggest that this madman strategy of President Trump seems to be working you know this isn't some crazy conspiracy theory Richard Nixon used the madman strategy it's to appear volatile unpredictable and and reckless willing to you know have a credible threat of violence both economic economic violence military violence political violence and he has a credible threat and it's worked Niccolo Machiavelli wrote about this pretty credibly in in the discourses on Livy 500 years ago 501 years ago he said it I'm paraphrasing but at times it's quite helpful it's quite useful to appear mad to appear reckless or insane and we're seeing this work out with President Trump I wonder when his detractors are gonna get the message because it's just working so consistently and on such a large scale you would think they'd get the message soon but they probably won't okay we've got to bring on speaking of the culmination of Scilly season we've got to bring on our very good friend Allie Stuckey who is being accused of spreading fake news of she created the satire video we played it on the show a couple days ago obvious satire making fun of a widely seen clip of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez on Margaret Hoover's program and the left has pummeled Ally they've said you're spreading fake news you're making Alexandria Ocasio Cortes look like a fool Ally what do you have to say for yourself young lady I have to say I am so sorry I am never ever ever going to tell the joke ever again and what I realized is that that practice is really only exclusively reserved to comedic geniuses like Michelle wolf like Samantha bee like Stephen Colbert all of those people that are so original and compelling in their comedy I just don't have what it takes I've realized that I've learned my lesson and it's only serious commentary from now on I'm really glad to hear that because as you know only left wingers are allowed to make jokes conservatives are not allowed to make jokes and and when you make jokes I've been watching a lot of Jimmy Kimmel recently and Michael Ian Black and and you have to you're supposed to not make people laugh you're supposed to cry you're supposed to just sit into the camera crying so you clearly got it all wrong I gotta tell you this this blow up from your video is my favorite news story of the week my great my real question on this because the video is obvious satire you posted it with a little winky face it's in you know you're in different clothing it's on a different set I mean it it is no offense to the production I think this is part of its charm it's a little low production quality this was not you know some great a selective editing and uniformly the press attacked you they said this is their this is an unfair attack on Cortese my question is are the press and the Democrats being obtuse here intentionally misrepresenting the video or are they really that stupid no I think that I think that you're right that they're misrepresenting the inner the satire of the video and you made a comment earlier that they take something that they know is a joke and they blow it up into this national scandal in order to discredit any legitimate humor that's in it because one number one a conservative is not allowed to be funny if the conservative is being funny then it's mean but if Sasha Baron : is funny or if he makes fun of someone on the right then it's hilarious its comedic genius but if the conservative does it and it's bigoted I mean number two I also think it lit it hid a little bit too close to home for them because I think it was a little bit now that I look back difficult to distinguish Alexandria actually making a fool of herself in the PBS interview and us making her make a fool of herself in a satirical interview so I think the left has tried really hard for the past weeks to make us forget about that firing line interview to cover up the fact that Alexandria really has no earthly idea what her own agenda is and this just hit a little bit too close to home it was too soon for and I think that's why they didn't eat this joke very well that's exactly what I think I I think I'm not being a conspiracy theorist when I observe that the left and the Democrats had this real problem which is that their superstar girl who won this big surprise election in Queens looked like an absolute idiot I mean not only did you not know anything but she was proudly ignorant she said oh hehehe I'm not the expert on this simple thing I know she's got a degree in international relations from Boston University she as she said oh I think people aren't comfortable with politicians who don't know everything she it's not that she doesn't know everything she doesn't know anything and I think the left and the media honed in on this and they said shoot how are we gonna get out of this and say oh we're going to we found the satire video we're gonna say it's her fault it's Ally Stuckey's fault that Ocasio cortez looks like an idiot on on the video they're basically using you as the scapegoat for why their own candidate looks foolish am I crazy what they don't realize is that I've got multiple emails from Democrats from people saying look I don't like you I don't follow you I don't agree with anything you say but thank you for doing that because this is not going to be the future of my party we have a lot of people backing away from the socialist label and backing away from her specifically because not only is she a far left socialist which I think a lot of Democrats actually imposed whether they say it or not but she's a stupid socialist it would be one thing if she was smart if she was able to back up what her beliefs are if she was able to say well here's why I think Israel is occupying Palestine that okay we can deal with that but she's not even able to do that so I've actually seen a lot of people from the left comport and say thank you so much for doing that but what we see is the frontrunners for this particularly the Millennials on the left they just don't want to play that game this is their sacred cow this is the so-called future of their party and it's not a joking matter Michael yeah no that's that's absolutely right and I do want to ask about the topic of the satire video itself this this girl doesn't know anything Alexandria Cassio Cortes she's also a liar she misrepresents where she comes from I know this because I come from almost exactly the same places that she comes from at almost exactly the same time so I just I know for a fact that she's a liar and I do wonder how are Democrats gonna going to react here you know socialists have relied on useful idiots for the entire history of socialism Lenin did Stalin did all the way right up to Little Miss Ocasio Cortez is the party going to embrace this leftward lurch double down on their base try to bring out the base for the midterms and move it you know left of Lenin or are they going to it were is that going to be unsuccessful are they going to have to go back to the center and you know nominate Joe Manchin in 2020 or something like that where is the party actually headed well I think that it the party doesn't really have a choice it's where the people say the party is going to go so Millennials aren't going to be the biggest voting bloc if they do vote once more baby boomers die starting to be morbid but I think that they're looking at Millennials and saying okay these are going to be the voters what did they care about what did they think and unfortunately we know that a lot of Millennials do lean to the left and a lot of young people in general advocate for things like free health care coverage and free college we know that the Democrats are trying to pass a bill right now that demands a free two-year Community College and we know that's just a stepping stone into the hole for a four-year college direction so I think if that's any indication it looks like even though it even though it seems like it's on the fringe it looks like the entirety of the Democratic Party is going where I think it has to go in order to attract young voters and I think that is in the direction of socialism yeah they don't have the choice do they I always wondered why Pelosi and Schumer didn't try to work with President Trump when he came into office President Trump is relatively unknown for a Republican president I felt they could have maybe worked with him but but their base wouldn't let them I mean their voters simply had them in a corner they couldn't work with President Trump and this this question I have man I'll let you go or is it wise for conservatives to cheer on the ocasion Cortez's say yeah guys nominate the craziest communists you can so we can win the next election or is there a danger there should we watch out because the more they nominate these people there are 42 Democratic socialists of America endorsed candidates running in this cycle you know the more that they run these candidates the more mainstream socialist ideas get and in the long term it might hurt us which is it should we be happy when they nominate these crazy lefties or should we should we warn against them well so I think that there's a danger here you have people like Conor Liam from Pennsylvania for example who came across as a moderate who said you know I'm gonna be middle of the aisle we kind of praise this as saying okay this is good maybe they're Democrats who actually want to moderate candidate but I think what we're going to see is that these people that are running moderately are actually going to rule or legislate to the left and so I would almost rather someone like Acacio Cortez at least come out and say no I am far left no I am a socialist so we can call out the stupidity beforehand I just don't think that there is a moderate direction for the Democratic Party so it's almost like whatever opportunity that we can take to show the stupidity of socialism the better it is but you're right it is going to require us fighting that much harder if we are going to actually show the stupidity of it or else you know we'll just be overcome by totalitarianism like every other generation around the world that that's such a good point that the question might not be here for the Democrats between the far left and the centrists that ship has sailed the question is between people who are honest about their ideological points of view and people who hide it you know that ocasion Cortez she might lie about her background but she's at least honest about her ideology whereas someone like Connor lamb is is hiding it that's a really good point kind of depressing but you like to you did I heard Maxine Waters yesterday and day before yesterday we know how crazy she is but she said look we are not the Socialist Party we're not the Socialist Party we are not socialists so I do think that you have baby boomers that do fear that word not just services but because you've got a lot of people like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton that are capitalists they like capital capitalism is done very well by them hasn't it exactly so I do a generational difference there and it's just a matter of whether Democrats are going to say okay we have no choice but to head in the direction of mullen meals or no we're gonna take our party back we'll see ya good good point all right Ally I gotta let you go I'm very pleased though that you have finally you know self flagellated maiya colpa Mia culpa for that awful deceptive deceitful fake news all right I'm you know great grace abounds I will talk to you later alligator cu8 alright we've got to say goodbye to Facebook in YouTube then we have a whole mailbag to get to so let's let's hurry up through that I'm always late on the mailbag or and I will try to run through them today if you are on daily we're calm thank you very much you help keep the lights on you keep leftist tears bubbling up through my cup and there are a lot of them these days I've got this Shaun Maloney a female hygienic product vintage it doesn't it's not it's not great it's like frankly I'd go back and you know use the james gunn vintage or something somewhat of one from this week but you get the left is tears tumblr that is the most important thing sure will you get my show Drew's show the ben shapiro show you get to ask questions in the mailbag which is coming up you test questions in the conversation this is what you want this is the thing baby go to daily wire.com we'll be right back with a mailbag let's burn through them we're getting to all these questions today starting with Emanuel o come o come Emmanuel hi Michael I was wondering if you could clarify the definition of ideology for me what is the difference between a system of beliefs and ideology for example I'm a conservative and a Catholic why or aren't they considered ideology does it just constitute the amount of passion one has if so where's the line thanks so much love the show okay this is really a tough question actually I pulled some notes out for this one because people misunderstand this one a lot I've been reading a lot of Michael Oakshott he's a great political philosopher from Britain in the 20th century and very few people read him but they should read him because he's very good I'll use his definitions I'm stealing freely from him uh the the conservative thought and the Catholic Church and these things are not ideologies they should not be ideologies we can lean into it i ology sometimes we can fall into ideology but we should resist it as much as we can what is the definition of ideologies in a great essay called rationalism and politics Oakshott defines ideology as the formalized abridgement of the supposed substratum of rational truth contained in the tradition which is a mouthful but I think it's a pretty good approximation it's very formalized it's rationalized it you can write it down in a book another another definition he gives in a different essay is ideologies of vocabulary of beliefs in terms of which to conduct political discourse so you can know an ideology by its vocabulary you know the left they say yes slay folks be an ally and then we can go adulting together and you can tell that there's an ideological point of view there you know ideology is it gives the appearance of a complete system you use the word system that's a good place to begin it's a system you can fit it all in a book you can put an ideology in a book or a manifesto or a doctrine and they say this is this is our ideology now but you can never fit the totality of knowledge into a book of course not there you always hear there's some guy you know so-and-so is street smart but he's not book smart or is book smart but he's not street smart someone can be very book smart and have no idea how to get along in the world why is that because there are two kinds of knowledge there's a technical knowledge which you can write down in a book and there is practical knowledge the knowledge that is just it comes from your gut it comes from the rituals that you do it comes from the traditions that you're part of the institutions that you're a part of the you if you're born into it and then grows through you as if it's in the air you can never put that into a book you know a good example of this I guess is a cookbook and this is an example Oakshott gives I can hand you a cookbook you will not become Mario Batali because I hand you a cookbook you will have the you'll have some technical knowledge in there turn the thing on to this you know use these ingredients this is what constitutes the this dish or whatever but that won't make you a great cook because there's a practical knowledge that's required to idealogy in the modern sense also it can really be traced back to Machiavelli the guy who wrote the Prince there you know where the prince and discourses on Livy in the prince he says here is a shortcut here's a crib to politics here is for the new Prince the prince who doesn't have generations of political education behind him here is a cheat sheet and this will give you some ideological doctrines that you can incorporate in to your political leadership and you know a lot of teenage kids they read the Prince the first time and they say oh great now I can be the president you know now I can be whatever no and Machiavelli makes this this clear - he doesn't just offer this book and he says ok now you can go govern the principality he says here's a book here's some technical knowledge but you need me he offers himself he writes the prince in part to get himself a job right cuz he says you need someone who has practical knowledge to lead you through it you know the teacher can teach from the lecture hall but that's that will bring some information over but you also have internships for a reason to work alongside a master that he can't tell you he can't use words or put it into a book but you just learned by being in the practice with somebody it's really important ideology this is another bit from Oakshott is not the quasi divine parent of political activity but the earthly stepchild the ideology comes after the political activity it doesn't we don't we don't comport ourselves as we do in America we don't we we who you know love liberty or this or that we don't behave as we do in America because we read a doctrine somewhere that's not where it comes from the doctrine comes out of the political tradition that you have the left would like to pretend it's all in a in a book but when you pretend that all of knowledge can just be fit into a book you go totally off the charts you when when the French Revolution is a good example in the French Revolution they tried to erase all of tradition they tried to obliterate everything churches or temples of Reason now and rip up all the neighborhoods and have new neighborhoods and what it leads to the guillotine it leads to the terror because it's just not human it's just not where we come from another good example of this is institutions and traditions you'll hear conservatives who say we don't want to be ideological they'll say you know you've got to look to the tradition one reason why it's very hard to export democracy around the world why we can't just lift up American ideas and plant them in Iraq and expect it to take hold overnight is because we think the ideologue think that the the traditions and the institutions the Congress and the court and the this and that are just expressions of our ideas that we wrote down in a book somewhere but that's not true Oh chef puts it very well he says we do not first decide that certain behavior is right or desirable and then express our approval of it in an institution our knowledge of how to behave well is the institution in another place with every step it has taken away from the true sources of its inspiration the rationalist or the ideological character has become cruder and more vulgar what in the 17th century was larger poll say the art of thinking has now become your mind and how to use it a plan by world-famous experts for developing a trained mind at a fraction of the cost it's this crude vulgar rationalism and and that you bring up the Catholic Church this does this is important here because a break the beginning of rationalism in politics the beginning of ideologies occurred simultaneously with the Protestant revolution and that's no coincidence these these I this idea that you can break away the principles and the doctrines and just have that floating in space without the ends ocean without the tradition is an essentially liberal idea it's a rationalist idea and you see a lot of its character in Protestantism to varying degrees that that is why there is a coincidence in the American conservative tradition of Catholics taking the lead Russell Kirk Bill Buckley other writers as well they they take the lead all of these justices on the Supreme Court because there is an an conservative disposition to institutions that you don't have when people just pretend that you can have doctrines flying up in the air it's a long answer it's a complicated answer and I hope that clears it up a little bit because people abuse the word ideology and fall into that a lot and conservatives really shouldn't it's one of the key aspects that separates the left from the right when the right is at its best next question maybe this one will be a little easier oh it will from Keegan have you ever checked out the Chrome extension millennial to snake people my favorite Chrome extension ever I install it secretly on every machine I use I work in IT you might have fun with it so I hadn't heard of this until you know 20 minutes ago or an hour ago when I read that question briefly in my notes and you have to get it you have to go get it right now it's called a millennial to snake people and what the extension does is every time the word millennial shows up in your browser it replaces it with snake people so it will say you know like you know Millennials like to eat avocado a toast and then it would be like the snake people like to eat avocado to us you know ten ways you know that you're a snake people it really is very effective it brings the truth of online articles and and treatises really really well so I check it out from Jonathan dear Michael I really enjoy your show you were always very funny funny how funny like I'm a clown like I amuse you I make you laugh huh thank you thank you for the compliment in Wednesday's episode you discussed in vitro fertilization and how pro-life groups do not actively oppose in vitro fertilization often in spite of the indefinite freezing and selective abortion of many embryos or fetuses involved in it I'm a grad student in genetics and I'm pro-life I do not disagree in theory with in vitro fertilization but do disagree with the discarding of human embryos that have been produced for this reason I view adoption as a better option than in-vitro fertilisation for couples who are unable to have children my question is do you think that pro-life groups do not actively oppose in vitro fertilization because it would be unpopular among their supporters because they're focusing on other battles that they feel they're more likely to win it asks two pros opposing a Planned Parenthood or because of another reason yeah yes all of that and I think certainly the latter you've got a you've got to make choices this actually ties in with the ideology question the pro-life movement is about preserving life and stopping unborn babies from being killed slaughtered on mass a million a year or more in the United States and so they're going to they're gonna try to save as many babies as they can one way if the pro-life movement only focused on the first two days of after fertilization after conception you know the morning-after pill if they've directed all of their efforts at the morning-after pill some of which or abort abortion drugs some or sometimes abortion drugs and not abortion drugs it's a little less clear if they focused all of their efforts on that they'd be much less successful more babies would die every year if they focused all of their efforts on IVF in vitro fertilization because it discards it creates a ton of conceived people you know it creates a lot of fertilized embryos and then it discards them if it focused only on that they would many more babies per year would die it would be it would be much less effective because people go to IVF because they want to have more children it's a more confusing issue it's a it's not as clear it's not as clear-cut they could I be opposing life when I'm trying to create more life and it's much harder for that but when you focus on a six-month-old baby unborn baby in the womb that is so much clearer you see its little eyes you see its little fingers it's moving around and the end and you see villains who are trying to kill that baby that that is a much clearer issue and it's much easier to win over so practically speaking that's where the pro-life movement should focus its efforts but we shouldn't pretend otherwise there's nothing about having little fingers that makes your life sacred and not having little fingers makes your life not sacred and in vitro fertilization in this all the time creates so many embryos that are discarded and adoption might be an answer for this but you know don't forget if you're going to fertilize 8 embryos if you're gonna create 8 little sparks of human life every time you do IVF that's going to be a lot of kids that you've got to put up for adoption you've got a you've got to find women surrogates who would be willing to carry those babies to term and I don't know that that's a really workable solution conservatives should be they should focus on the areas they can win increasingly win on the pro-life movement but don't don't pretend that IVF is some simple bioethical problem or that it's it doesn't pose bioethical problems it does it poses huge bioethical problems and as we keep advancing the pro-life cause conservatives should think about that good question I've got time for one or two more from Josh dear Michael owner of libs do you believe Sarah Sanders will do us all a favor and ban sad Jim Acosta from the press pool and if there was a vacancy and The Daily wire were invited who would be the best White House correspondent and why I must disagree with you my friend I would be furious if Sarah Sanders banned Jim Acosta from the press pool Jim Acosta is one of the best characters in all of politics he's I've by the way I've never seen him in the same room as Will Ferrell at the same time which does bring up some questions it's wonderful I want Ron Burgundy to be in that press room and Jim Acosta is there you know Shelly mr.brother Robert he's great if if he were kicked out by Sarah Sanders and The Daily wire were invited to join the press room I would nominate Jim Acosta to be our correspondent in the White House press pool the guy is great and I hope he stays on TV a lot more let's see if we can do one or two more do we have time one more she says okay I'll do one more dear Michael I've heard some Catholics say that Catholicism is incompatible with the American Founding these critics say that because the Constitution does not mention Christ the founders failed to recognize that all power is given to Christ this would include power of her Nations as well as individuals these critics also point out America's allegedly Masonic roots how would you respond to these criticisms and that's how I would respond come alright we're some of the founders and framers freemasons yeah although there was a big anti Mason movement too I think John Quincy Adams led a big anti Mason movement in the United States obviously the Freemasons don't have a lot of prestige anymore in the u.s. sure the nation was founded in 1776 by Protestants where it was founded in 1620 by quite zealous Protestants in Plymouth although of course all of America was discovered by a Catholic Christopher Columbus a devout Catholic who said is a book of ours and multiple prayers constantly throughout the day and he was you know always praying and so it was quite Catholic I like that the actual American founding the first moment that we could say this is the origin is a rather Catholic moment and you know America is named after an Italian Amerigo Vespucci that the name America is an Italian name so okay you know that's fine the Protestants obviously were so prominent in the United States and the I think it was Arthur Schlessinger said that anti-catholicism is the oldest and deepest bias in the United States so I don't deny any of that but I will say it's I don't think the United States is opposed to Catholicism in a way that revolutionary France was opposed to Catholicism revolutionary France killed priests you know revolutionary France and knocked down Catholic churches the the u.s. didn't do that and it gets back to our question of tradition versus ideology is there an ideological reflection in the American Founding of course we hold these truths to be self-evident these double life liberty the pursuit of happiness sure that's ideological and ideology is fine to reflect on what you're already doing on occasion it helps you see what's really going on but America did not reject tradition entirely built on tradition our revolution to use the idea of Edmund Burke was evolution not really revolution we didn't kick every everything apart and start from scratch with a blank slate we kept what was good we and we kept remained connected to those traditions that inherent traditionalism I think and reliance on tradition makes America perfectly compatible or quite compatible with the Catholic Church and also the observation of Alexander Alexander of of de Tocqueville that's his first name alexis de tocqueville the observation of de Tocqueville that the United States has these wonderful voluntary civic institutions people just choose to join them in the civic society civil society not just government organizations but you know all these voluntary associations that's quite compatible with Catholicism to rely on institutions and traditions that's quite good is America a Catholic country I don't think I'd go that far but is it totally relentlessly anti-catholic no way if it were it wouldn't have developed in the wonderful way that it did okay that's all I got to say goodbye we've got great questions but sad what a great man said go over to daily wire and oh by the way check out another kingdom because we're starting work on the second season of another Kingdom that's a Druze book that he wrote it's Drew's story that I perform all the roles in so you can still listen to all of season one of another Kingdom we've got
