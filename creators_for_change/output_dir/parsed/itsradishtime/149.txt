So, here’s the deal
I want to know, what makes you feel powerful.
I guess that’s a fairly recent discovery
of mine, is that powerful is a human emotion
that is available to me in an array of feels
that I can feel.
I mean it takes awhile to get there right?
But then one day, you’re just say, in a
meeting at work and you’re saying intelligent
things with conviction, and people are LISTENING
to you and you’re like YEEEEESSSSS
It’s a feeling I am really into, but it
doesn’t happen all so often spontaneously,
so here are a few things I have found that
help me fake it.
1.
Choose a few role models.
It can be anyone you want, absolutely anyone.
But just have some people you can call upon
in times of weakness.
I personally like to summon the strength of
Ruth Bader Ginsburg combined with the spirit
of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler doing the Bitches
get stuff done bit on weekend update, encapsulated
in the essence of Nicki Minaj’s verse in
Monster and it takes me to a place.
2.
Don a power outfit.
whatever makes you feel your most badass.
I don’t care if it’s glitter unicorn space
princess or lumberjack chic, or health goth
or what have you.
I like to dress like I am not to be fucked
with ™. All black clothing.
Combat boots.
Winged eyeliner.
YES Even to work.
This may not be appropriate in all schools
or office environments but I am the consummate
professional in the body of an minimalist,
boyish goth queen.
3.
Choose a theme song.
For me, a power jam requires two things: all
kinds of drum and bass, and usually, some
gravely-voiced white dude shouting about things.
Case in point.
When I get all of those things together I
feel like I can take on the world.
But I wanna know what makes YOU feel like
you’re ten feet tall and capable of anything.
Comments!
I’m also going to link a playlist of my
favorite power jams.
In the comments, tell me what yours are, so
I can add them to my list.
Twitter, Tumblr, and instagram in the links
below.
I’ll see you next week.
Bye!
