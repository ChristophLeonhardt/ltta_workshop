at 13 pasa what Ratana coat wants to be just like his dad a Thai kickboxing champion he says it's in his blood the pride of my Thai skills the national sport here is instilled in Thais at a very early age at this training gym just outside Bangkok they start at 9:00 and that has raised concerns about brain injuries I was knocked out once I passed out for a bit when I hit the floor when I regained consciousness I felt a bit dizzy his father also started boxing at 9:00 then became a champion at 17 when I was a boxer of course I was knocked out but I think it's about training it's like a shield to protect ourselves but that's not nearly enough protection according to a recent medical study brain scans or MRIs were taken up 500 children under 15 years old from similar social economic backgrounds it lasted five years included non boxers and incorporated psychological testing this is the first complete mi study of the traumatic brain injury in chai boxer she says it's all about the damage of repeated minor brain trauma from blows to the head because of the damage stop the maturation the further maturation of some function of the brain cognitive function the memory or detachment the higher brain function is not well developed yet and when it cut damage it's very difficult for them to further develop and that includes memory loss and lower IQ and this is where the young boxers hope all that hard working stream the lucky ones like fossil its play big match venue like this one here at Bangkok's lumpini arena big bouts are exciting for boxers like pasa wat but with the increased intensity they are also more dangerous than sparring since my tie is part of Thai culture an outright ban for young boxers is not realistic the government body that oversees boxing has read the medical study we are figuring it out the way to solve the problem the law should be amended for maximum young boxer safety but the enforcement of the law is our weakness with an estimated 100,000 child boxers in Thailand many of them unregistered even once the law has changed protecting the boxers will be difficult and that could mean more head injuries as the study found out the longer they fight the more severe the damage scott hilar al jazeera bangkok
