hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle the drive towards war against Syria is unmistakable the pretext is still another alleged chemical attack as usual no evidence is presented as usual conclusions are drawn before an independent investigation but this time there's a difference Syria can defend itself and has powerful allies we live in very dangerous times raaah stocking syria i'm joined by my guess Joe Lauria in Washington he's the editor in chief of consortium news.com and author of how I lost by Hillary Clinton with the foreword by Julian Assange also in Washington we have Michael Maloof he is a former senior security policy analyst in the office of Secretary of Defense and in New York we have Richard Murphy he is a former US career ambassador to Syria and currently an adjunct scholar at the Middle East Institute all right crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate it let me go to Joe first in Washington it seems to me that you know we have we we have as president somebody very different than ran as president as little as a week ago Donald Trump but made a very public announcement that we'd be withdrawing from Syria fast forward up to the last few days or so it looks like he's being forced to stay there even if he doesn't want to stay there we have an entire course of the media driving for war the deep state is on board of course John Bolton is in place and I have to make one exception at least Tucker Carlson over at Fox at least is decided to express his dissent here where are we Joe Joe where does this all stand go ahead well the fact that he wanted to withdraw from Syria it makes it even less likely that the Syrian government was behind this attack we are seeing what we've seen for a long long time a pattern of deception by the US government depending on who the enemy of the day is if you want to go to war against Spain they blew up the main the north of Vietnamese attacked the ship in the Gulf of Tonkin Saddam had WMD Russia invaded Ukraine shot down a malaysian airlines' stolen election tried to kill the former double agent in britain and now is somehow implicated in this chemical attack this is what governments do but there's there are also two other parties beside government there's the press some people so governments lie all governments lie some worse than others but the press is jobs supposed to filter that and defend the public against government lies that we see now a press that's completely obsessed with its own fame with its career ism with Vicariate living through vicarious power of government and they are letting the public down so that these investigation these conclusions before investigations begin as you pointed out at the beginning are being are let it being a let to stand and this is as you said also said very very dangerous right now Richard is is on the table now a full regime change by use of military forces do you think that's in the cards right now go ahead Richard in New York I see no evidence that the administration has gone back to a position that you could say was early Obama that it was time for Assad to step aside I think it's reckons this administration has reconciled itself that Assad his president there's likely to stay for a while okay Michael but that thing that doesn't really square with what we've heard over the last few days here we have you know Nikki Nikki hailey going off the rail I mean you know I thought Samantha power was off the you know had wandered off the reservation but you know Nikki hey Haley takes the cake there and then we also in a Jen I'm glad Joe mention and we really have the drums of war in the media it seems to me that they really want to box Trump in if he does nothing that he's bluster if he does something it's against international law and he may get and it may be the law of unintended consequences by getting involved in this war you never know because if you look over the last 18 years you know these military adventures never end the way they expect go ahead Michael no I think you're you're right I think that even though President Trump wanted to get out I think that other people who were surrounding him are much more determined that that that he stay and actually the fact that he that he's you that John Bolton is now the national security adviser who was the the the fellow who who really really wanted us to go into Iraq on the premise that there was WMD I I think that the administration is slowly turning toward regime change again I think that that's what they're they're going to go after and the whole idea I think as far as a strategic policy if there is one for the United States ultimately is to divide Syria yeah well then that's been you know that's the the you can throw in the Turkish angle which of course is a completely different program but you know it looks like is a partition is really what they're gonna settle on here you know Jo the interesting thing is is that you know I've never believed that anybody in the US government politicians you know think tankers and all of that they don't give a hoot about the the Syrian people they never have and what I see now is this this is a geopolitical gambit here we've noticed that Russia is being held responsible for this alleged chemical attack which would there is no evidence presented to the to the public which I guess the public is just getting used to a day evidence-free foreign policy to go to war go ahead Jo yeah I don't think they care very much about the American public either let alone the Syrians I mean this is another attempt to drag Russia into this and Russia we don't even we have no idea why or even if there was a chemical attack that hasn't even begun the investigation we we hear nikki Haley saying we need an investigation but it's in one side of her mouth and the other side of the mouth Syria did it and Russia was behind it this is really really not a good not a safe situation as you pointed out I do think that they noticed that Russia and russian-backed Syrian government was winning this war was practically over that the suburbs of Damascus Goethe had been a thorn in the side of the Syrian government since the very beginning of this conflict five years ago it was really a last stronghold after Aleppo and it lab so I think that that is a realization in the capitals of Riyadh and in Ankara and certainly in Washington that this was the land by the rebels themselves this was the last chance if they were going to try to reverse this tide so the Gribble's needed to bring the u.s. into it which is why it seems like they may very well have been behind and Russia by the way behind this attack Russia warned by the way three weeks ago that this could very this could happen that there was a false flag a chemical attack in the works I don't know if that's what happened but I certainly don't know that the Syrian government did it but that doesn't seem to matter to people like nikki Haley Syria did it and now we're going to see an attempt maybe by the United States to get deeply involved in this to reverse the tide and this is their last chance before the Syrian government wins this war which they on the verge of doing Richard knows what what national interest does Syria hold because I mean you know it when Trump came in almost exactly a year ago there was an alleged chemical incident and then he ordered a tomahawk a strike against Syria no evidence we know now the secretary maddest came out and said well we don't have any evidence there ever was a chemical attack perpetrated by the Syrian government I mean what what is wrong with these people I mean a year ago we an attack was made illegally again against the country's sovereignty here and now this is like rerunning this bad film I mean why in Syria has never attacked the United States it is not a threat to American national interests and now we're on the verge of going to war Congress doesn't even get involved it abrogates its responsibility to war-making I mean why is Syria is so important for the United States that get involved militarily please Richard in New York it's its start with its geographic position it is in a key area and the policies it has followed over the last few years of opening the doors to Iran to establish a increasing militia president but Richard isn't isn't isn't that the sovereign tryied or isn't that the sovereign right of a state if we can't Syria have friends they have its own choosing why does the United States determine what countries can have friends with whom why go ahead Richard well come on it's not just a matter of smiling at each other and having friends they are actively assisting the government of Iran in creating a corridor across Iraq Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon with the aim of mounting pressure on the Israelis and that that has to catch American attention okay that's really let me go to Michael well you know some some sovereignty is more important than others okay I mean serious should have the legal sovereign right to make whatever friends at okay the United States does that all the time okay and nobody says anything about it and let me go to Michael you know you know Israel is right on the border they're one of the largest militaries in the world most powerful and it has never lifted one finger to fight terrorism in Syria actually just the opposite it's aided and abetted groups okay so I mean worried about Israel's concerns Israel's part of the problem here and I think and Saudi Arabia is part of the problem here two key allies of the United States go ahead Michael yeah this you hit up you hit right on it at the end there yeah this this is as a reveal that between the Saudis and the Israelis and again the Saudis actually are pouring millions of dollars into the Sunni controlled areas as well as int 11 on because they see it but they see a potential for Iran absolutely capturing them as as as far as the influence is concerned and the Saudis are absolutely against that and you have the Israelis who are trying to help that and they see the they see the forward movement of the Iranians as a direct threat to them and and as a consequence I wouldn't doubt that the Israelis could initiate an attack on Lebanon almost any time sure and I know people in Lebanon that I talked to are very concerned about that Joe weigh in on that there because he is you know is this policy being driven by Tel Aviv in Riyadh well certainly Riyadh and other Gulf states from the very beginning in Turkey wanted the overthrow of right Saad and that brings me to the point that whether you agree or like the Assad government or not it's a fact that they've been on the defensive this is an uprising this was an attempt to overthrow a government so you're on the defensive so to invite Iran in and Russia to help them defend themselves is a natural act of a government trying to survive this was not Iran or Russia invading Syria the Iranians wouldn't have come in if there were no attempt to overthrow the government so they they had every right as you pointed out to him why'd whoever they there were any friends they had to help them survive this is natural and any government would do that now the Israelis I mean Hezbollah by the way I think is the pending Lebanon even Lebanese Christians and they agree with as much as they hate they may hate that well they may not like them but they realize that the Lebanese army isn't worth joining me so let me jump in here let me jump in here we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue more discussion on sirius stay with our key welcome back to cross stock where all things are considered on Peter labelled Tremonti we're discussing the situation in Syria okay let me go back to Richard in New York Richard I know you're a career diplomat and diplomacy is sorely lacking these days around the world but Richard me what a military strike against the the regime the Assad government in Damascus what is that's what kind of what outcome would Washington be looking for in striking Syria you you said that they've backed away from regime change I think that doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense I think they would want want to go all the way I mean what kind of behavior is that you go trying to enact here I mean this is the problem with military policy because it doesn't really work with political outcomes it has certain goals of destruction and threatening it doesn't really talk about the political part of it go ahead Richard in New York well we we certainly do need a clearer overall policy towards Syria the strategy has been wanting to put it mildly now the question though what are what were we trying to accomplish by staying and why we're 2000 yeah very small number there in northeastern Syria we don't think first of all we don't think that the Isis effort is totally ended oh and we also know there are other groups ready to come in and its wake if given the least opportunity so what's needed is a strategy which develops the country as a whole as quickly as possible involves the people with their own government as quickly as possible after these years of warfare and massive killings and dislocations it's not going to come easily it's not gonna come quickly but one thing we can contribute at the moment is the continued small military presence in the country with Isis very much at the top of our concerns well Richard did just the opposite is probably the truth I mean the the u.s. maintaining its forces in Syria probably gives Isis a reason to exist to fight a foreign occupier number Richard the this US government is already warned it will sanction third parties and countries that help Syria with its reconstruction so getting all the people together and helping developing the country that's already off the table you'll be sanctioned okay Michael I could see you wanted to jump in there go ahead you know so yeah III that's once again gets back to the whole point as to why US forces are remaining in the Sunni controlled area of eastern eastern Syria looking for bases actually that the Turks have complained about in the Kurdish controlled area the whole idea is I think by the United States if it's trying to resurrect the strategic policy of any kind is the unites the Sunnis in East Syria with West Western Iraq and to maintain that presence there and control that area and basically partition Syria ultimately even though you have a little pocket of of Isis but but the United States is supporting entities and and and groups militant groups still such as josh al islam which was in east guta and and has a capability by the way of launching chlorine gas and and other and other weapons of mass destruction they have actually admitted that in the past up in aleppo earlier this year so the United States is going to continue to support these Sunni control groups and I think ultimately it is to divide Syria and with the help of the the Saudis the Saudis are paying for this there are they they've offered money and and I think Trump will a taken that may be the only reason why he has decided not to pull out because well got a good II do you know my college isn't it really paid for isn't it really wonderful that the u.s. government pimps out the American military for a foreign power what a disgrace what a real disgrace you know we're Korean women and for the people that work in the military to be pimped out by their own President to have you know some Wahhabi crazy regime and Saudi Arabia pay you you know you wrap your head around that okay that's pretty that's amazing okay let me go to Joe here I think Joe it's happening let me go to Joe here you know it what's not what is happening to me is that there's such an uproar in the United States because of Russia Russia Russia and this disease has transported itself across the Atlantic into Britain right now over another chemical weapons incident which we see no evidence of whatsoever disposed to believe it but Joe that they want to give Russia bloody knows they want to give Russia bloody nose in Syria the Russians have already made it very clear that they will not take those threats lightly okay that's why I'm very very concerned go ahead Joe yes I totally agree with you know we have to understand that the it's a fiction that the United States was fighting Isis in Syria I believe they were fighting them in Iraq I think there were two separate wars we know from this until defense intelligence agency document from 2012 that the US and its partners in the region and in Europe wanted to establish a Salafist principality which later became Isis it was warned about that then we know from a John Kerry leaked audio that he was watching he says he was we were watching Isis advance on Damascus to try to get Assad to leave exactly what that document had said that to put pressure on Isis so there was no there is no effort to defeat I structure has defeated with Syria and Iran and other industry militias have defeated Isis in Syria they're not there for that reason and we have to remember also at from the campaign of Donald Trump he wanted to cooperate with Russia in Syria and so let's worry about the form of government later on whether Assad stays or not the real problem was Isis why'd the key I don't know who told him that whether it was Bannen or whatever or he just got a brilliant idea one morning but that was the right policy that even Obama tried to implement if you recall he had Kerry try to work out a cooperation - Russia the pulse car - destroy you know ice you know spoiled the priority you know that's right again let me you know like the you know be Eve even when there is a legitimate or quasi legitimate diplomatic attempt that is it's destroyed by these hawks in the military and now Peter yeah and now Peter he wanted to withdraw the troops if you read a piece in The New Yorker by Robin Wright the generals were the ones who are supposed to be running the show not the present they we have a civilian former government here not the generals so again Trump's instincts are to say the right thing but he's pulled back by those behind him and this attack coming very fortuitously when he was about to withdraw the troops looks like the opposite is gonna happen you know Richard why why does the why is the United States threatening the Damascus government when Damascus has been doing the heavy lifting to fight Isis and what the United States does every time it goes in there militarily has its forces on the ground it just dull ins that attempt to fight terrorism you know the u.s. policy is an impediment to fighting Isis I don't understand the logic here go ahead Richard in New York but well i flatly disagree with your assumption about at least the consistency of syrian policy to fight Isis what is it is what is the u.s. done in Syria what is one name one thing the United States has done right when it comes to Syria one thing well we tried for many many years to get Syria interested in opening up talks with the Israelis and they were very very reluctant to come anywhere near that line in his last year's seven years of civil war a proxy international war it's because Assad didn't want to talk to the Israelis really no no don't don't misinterpret I'm just saying that we have tried to do something positive in Syria we did work on it extensively year after year didn't get anywhere okay so that's that's passed but it didn't leave a very good impression of Syria in in Washington I can tell you after the billions of dollars the training the funding the salary of these jihadists from outside the country that's what the US policy has been and now they are illegally present they're under illegally under international law the Damascus government wants them out and they won't leave I mean who's breaking the law here who's being an animal here okay this this war could have ended a long time ago if it hadn't been backed by the United States Saudi Arabia the other Gulf countries and Israel would have been over a long time ago go ahead Michael do you want to jump in it could have been over a long time ago if I hadn't piled in and beaten up those kids down and Dada okay there were violence and they was from outsiders it says very well-documented you know don't tell me you know this is all peaceniks more are you gonna wandering around you know giving flowers to people because that's a violence started on day one okay Michael you wanted to jump in the you know the our relationship with the CIA are with I'm sorry with with Syria actually degraded in 2003 when we invaded Iraq the Assyrians saw that this was going to happen they had they had the back-channel with the CIA and when they helped but to a point they did and then that's when they turned to the Pentagon just on the eve of the invasion to say don't don't invade well we'll try to work this out Molina stayed some 5000 troops to go into Iraq for you to to look for WMD they saw what would hit but the outcome will be so and everything went went to pieces from them that's when Assad really turned to Iran right after that and and that cannot be disputed that is a that is a fact and and I think that that's when Iran and Syria really began to become closer you got to keep in mind Assad is a is a Shiite Alawite so that that was normal and this is what upset your Israel to a great extent our foreign policy in the United States has been to carry out to help implement Israel's foreign policy for years and the Pentagon was the instrument for doing that okay Joe not 40 seconds you into program go ahead Joe yeah well John Bolton began this week his new jobs and our security adviser he has real thing for Iran the Iranian presence in Syria might be what he we ultimately be going after even more than trying to overthrow Assad yeah yeah it looks to me like always it's it's it's Iran always is at the very very center it has been at since their of the the Revolution in 1979 and in Trump and he has surrounded him with a group of people that feel exactly the same way people that lament the defeat in Vietnam that's all the time we have gentlemen many thanks to my guests in Washington and in New York and thanks to our viewers for watching us here dark you see you next time and remember cross top rules
