THE LAW DURING THEIR INVESTIGATION INTO THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL SCANDAL. CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT CATHERINE HERRIDGE JOINS US TONIGHT TO TELL US WHAT SHE IS HEARING. Reporter: THEY DESCRIBED IT IN DETAIL IN THE BALLPARK OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES. THE TIMELINE IS FIRMING UP WITH TENTATIVE DATES ON THE CALENDAR FOR PUBLIC TESTIMONY FROM MICHAEL HOROWITZ. WHILE THE OFFICE IS NOT COMMENTING ON THE FINDINGS, THE SOURCE SAYS THERE IS EVIDENCE OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. FOX NEWS CONFIRMED REPORTS OF AT LEAST ONE REFERRAL. WHEN DEPUTY DIRECTOR ANDREW McCABE WAS FIRED, HE TOLD THE DEPUTY GENERAL THAT HE DISAGREED WITH THE FINDINGS ARGUING THAT HIS BOSS KNEW ABOUT HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" ." McCABE CLAIMED HE WANTED TO BE SEPARATED, AND TO CALL ME WAS PRESSED ON THE ALLEGATION IN HIS INTERVIEW. DID THE INSPECTOR GENERAL INTERVIEW YOU ABOUT YOUR HANDLING OF THE MEMOS? SURE. HE HAS ALREADY. AND I EXPECT A REPORT ON THEM. NOT ON THAT, BECAUSE IT'S FRIVOLOUS BUT DID I COMPLY WITH POLICY? THAT BEGAN MONTHS AGO WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. Bret: WHAT'S THE LATEST FROM THE EFFORTS TO OBTAIN THESE DOCUMENTS FROM THE DOJ AND FBI? THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND THEIR TEAMS ARE DONE MEETING WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ABOUT RECORDS, AND WITH A SUBPOENA IN EFFECT, THE ONUS THEY BELIEVE A LOT IS ON THE DOJ AND FBI TO MAKE THE DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE. THEY HAD OFFERED THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN A MEETING TODAY WITH DEPUTY ATTORNEY ROB ROSENSTEIN. FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY, SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS, BUT LAWMAKERS DID NOT RESPOND. I THINK THAT INVITATION WAS JUST TO COME AND TALK AGAIN. WE HAVE ASKED FOR DOCUMENTS, 46,000 DOCUMENTS THAT JUSTICE HAS TOLD US TO GET AN WE'VE RECEIVED 9,000 OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS.
