00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,290
This August,
the US will experience what's

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,980
being dubbed by some as
the ‘Great American Eclipse,’

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,790
the first total solar eclipse
seen from the U.S. coast to coast

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,930
in nearly a century.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,750
While a partial eclipse will be
visible to most US states, sky

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,690
watchers are expected to flock
here, the path of totality,

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,920
the only area where a total
eclipse can be seen.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,860
>> A total eclipse is something
that everybody should put

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,800
on their bucket list because
it's one of the most remarkable

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,880
scenes in all of nature.

[MUSIC]

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,340
>> A solar eclipse
happens when the moon

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,750
passes between the Earth and

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,210
the sun, casting areas of
the earth's surface in darkness.

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,510
It shouldn't be confused with
the more common lunar eclipse,

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,050
where the Earth passes
between the moon and the sun.

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,130
The total eclipse
happens in five phases.

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,390
The first phase
begins as the moon

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,360
makes first contact
with the sun.

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,650
The second phase occurs moments
before the moon totally

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,120
encompasses the sun, sunlight
escapes past the moon's peaks

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,390
and valleys causing the diamond
ring effect and Bailey's beads.

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,540
>> That dazzling diamond
shrinks down and

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,810
gets fainter and fainter.

25
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,880
And finally, that remaining
little crescent breaks up

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
into a string of bright beads.

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,410
>> The third phase, totality,
is the only time that the sun's

28
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,670
outermost atmosphere,
the corona, can be viewed.

29
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,150
The fourth phase happens
as totality ends and

30
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,830
the moon begins moving away from
the sun's path, when viewers

31
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,190
can again observe the diamond
ring effect and Bailey's beads.

32
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,310
The fifth phase occurs
as the eclipse ends.

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,430
A total solar eclipse
happens every year to

34
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,850
any given area across the globe.

35
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,370
On average, though,
it only passes one location in

36
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,687
the Northern Hemisphere
every 375 years or so.

37
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:14,300
The event will give scientists
in the U.S. a rare opportunity

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,370
to study the sun as well.

39
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,490
>> Certainly, one of the biggest
mysteries about the sun's corona

40
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,830
is its temperature.

41
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,560
As you travel away from
the sun's surface and

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,930
move up through the corona, you
should expect the temperature to

43
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,500
go down, but
it doesn't, it goes up.

44
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,830
>> The next total solar eclipse
to hit the U.S. is expected in

45
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,330
April 2024.

46
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,540
>> That one begins in the
Pacific, crosses into Mexico,

47
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,560
and then it cuts into
the United States in Texas,

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,900
up through Indiana and
up into Ohio, and

49
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,800
through the New England
states and Southern Canada.

50
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,150
Now, because that happens in
April, the weather prospects for

51
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,550
that aren't as good as
this one in August.

52
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,110
>> But
if you want to be there for

53
00:02:57,110 --> 00:00:00,000
the ‘Great American Eclipse,’
it's August or never.
