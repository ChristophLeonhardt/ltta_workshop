1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,929
welcome back to the lead the national
lead now by most accounts almost all of

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,919
the people protesting against the
hateful bigots the Nazis and Klansmen

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,630
and Charlotte's Ville were peaceful but
not all of them in their midst was a

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,350
sometimes very violent group of
protesters that call themselves Anti Fog

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,609
known to not only clash with bigots but
also sometimes with police and

6
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,230
occasionally storefronts at least two
journalists in Virginia were assaulted

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,960
by violent counter protesters over the
weekend including

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,790
this cameraman from the Richmond CBS
affiliate CNN Sara Ganim now takes us

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,010
inside an T file and shows us this group
like you've never seen it before it's

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,410
6:00 a.m. in Portland Oregon and we're
headed to a bar with blacked-out windows

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,890
they wanted to meet us really early in
the morning because they're concerned

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,629
about a lot of people being around
we are meeting members of the Rove city

13
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,730
an tyfa short for anti-fascist this
group's main goal is to disrupt

14
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,789
neo-nazis and white supremacist but also
take on government and capitalism antifa

15
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,780
is any group that's willing to stand up
against fascist by any means necessary

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,430
by any means necessary they say can mean
outing a white nationalist at their work

17
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:22,070
or to their neighbors or as we've seen
recently violent fires property damage

18
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:28,229
hand-to-hand combat at protests across
the country explain to me the reasoning

19
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,790
behind fighting you have to make it so
unpalatable to be doing white

20
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,909
supremacist organizing that they no
longer want to do that and historically

21
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,930
that's what's worked you have to put
your body in the way and you have to

22
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,960
make it speak in a language that they
understand and sometimes that is

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,430
violence there's no firm number on how
many an sefa activists there are in the

24
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,140
u.s. because there isn't any one
organization most are local groups that

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,310
recruit and communicate through social
media but experts who track these

26
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,360
organizations say their membership is
growing in response to the rise of white

27
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,710
national groups and the election of
President Donald Trump

28
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,550
violence and property destruction led to
more than 200 arrests in Washington DC

29
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:16,130
on inauguration prosecutors say they
were wearing that covered head to toe in

30
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:22,850
black tactics against khakha West look
people dress in black locks for a few

31
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,810
things one Scott Crow has been leading
in our case and militant leftist groups

32
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,970
for decades so people put on the masks
so that we can all become anonymous and

33
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,770
then therefore we are able to move more
freely and do what we need to do whether

34
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,570
it is illegal or not so some people will
push back on that and say that the black

35
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,070
bloc is to keep people from being
identified and arrested when they break

36
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,870
the law when they commit crime right
it's a good way to avoid the

37
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:58,610
ramifications of law enforcement we saw
that firsthand at a May Day protest in

38
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,740
New York City when you cover our face we
pause and cover the Nazis will try to

39
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,270
find out who we are and that is a very
bad thing because they harass people

40
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,470
when they organize they kill people
they've hurt people they bite people

41
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,540
and we're the ones who are fighting back
they are the second coming of Hitler

42
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,280
police in Berkeley told us they haven't
seen this kind of destruction since the

43
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,440
1960s law enforcement in other cities
are dealing with similar situation like

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,120
in Portland Oregon where an sefa had
been involved in at least 10 a protest

45
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:39,739
ending in violence according to police
and it's wearing on the community it is

46
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,090
new it's like this Rumble mentality of
I'm going to bring my friends you bring

47
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,000
your friends and we're going to fight it
out in the park it's not something we've

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,350
seen here it's not good for the city
people are just frustrated by it

49
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,070
it's affecting their livability it's
affecting their business has it become

50
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,500
more violent it happens quicker the
fire-starting that we saw on May Day is

51
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,180
something we haven't really seen much of
in the past the running through the

52
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,709
street breaking windows and everything
in sight we haven't seen it as

53
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,459
consistently as we've seen in the last
eight months but it's the violence

54
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,779
that's gotten them attention directly
confronting groups that preach what

55
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,918
nationalists
rhetoric like on inauguration day when

56
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:28,389
white nationalist Richard Spencer was
punched in the face and it was the

57
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,319
antifoam movement that caused Berkeley
to cancel speeches by extreme-right

58
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:40,539
provocateurs like Milo he innopolis if
there are the more hardcore elements the

59
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:44,409
white supremacist and their Nazis to go
to these rallies that are itching for a

60
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,629
fight we're there to say we'll stand in
your way

61
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,800
the thing is Jake that experts who have
talked to say that the antipholus may

62
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,810
end up actually hurting their Cod across
the country people who are dressing in

63
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,730
black bloc are getting arrested
authorities are taking this seriously

64
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:09,170
but that's not stopping them at all they
have been telling me that they believe

65
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:14,840
that this tactic is working one of the
interesting things that I found in doing

66
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,580
this reporting which really surprised me
is that we found that a lot of these new

67
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,500
antifoam members they're young people
disenfranchised young people who felt

68
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,690
that they were let down by both parties
after the election and this is where

69
00:05:29,690 --> 00:00:00,000
they ended up Jake
