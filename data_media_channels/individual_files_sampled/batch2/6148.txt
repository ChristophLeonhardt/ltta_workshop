obviously one of the big criticisms of this bill is that it seems like the Republicans who always say they care about deficits suddenly don't care so much if they're willing to completely unnecessarily throw a 1.5 trillion dollar hole in the deficit and so a Grover Norquist was asked about this let's see what is responsible deficit numbers are all bogus no one has any idea what they are until they are what they are but it is pretty incredible then in a country where Republicans say they're so obsessed with the deficit they're willing to pass a plan that adds a trillion a half dollars to it if it's even accurate growth you're obsessed with the deficit growth no actually I mean I can go through books written by people on the GOP who are obsessed with the deficit in the debt in this country it's been like the single biggest thing at least when Democrats were in power even the presidents pointed out Barack Obama's debt record so Grover Norquist obviously his massive historic hypocrisy pointed out there and yet he smiles and why does he smile not because he was caught in a lie but because he's about to get a gigantic ass tax break he doesn't care if you call me a hypocrite yeah and a huge pay raise problem yeah if you don't know Grover Norquist he's the president of Americans for Tax Reform there's the epicenter for donors who are looking for tax cuts so they fund the so-called think-tank where they think really hard and decide yeah rich people should get a bigger tax cut and and so then their so-called papers and reports are used by congressmen to justify what their donors want in the first place oh they say here at Americans for Tax Reform that yes well look at that my daughter should get tax cuts should today and so but the entire time the guys like Norquist have been talking about well their deficits deficits deficits deficits and now all of a sudden what did I tell you we told you guys before the election we have been saying it now for close to a decade Republicans don't care about deficits in fact we found an old memo where Nyx's team said hey remember run up deficits when Republicans are in charge because it grows the economy and then when Democrats get in charge make sure that you keep complaining about the deficits so they make the mistake of not growing the economy which will help us defeat them later in elections so that is their strategy Erin Burnett I've never seen her actually do that good a follow pusher was in a follow-up question so I'm not a big fan of Erin Burnett I remember the during Occupy Wall Street howda recive yeah she was so she's nobody's progressive not at all okay even she goes wait a minute now I've been on here for quite some time and and all anybody ever talked about in the Republican side was deficits when the Democrats were in charge yeah now you get into office and all of a sudden they don't matter at all we're gonna add a wanting to have trillion else if Obama had done that they'd be talking about impeachment right now nor cuscuz under death it says who said deficits I'll give you at least one example the guy who wrote this tax plan is Paul Ryan and here's what he had said before they unveiled a plan he said it's going to be deficit neutral that's the budget rules we use which is called the bird rule later they decided no it's not gonna be deficit neutral we don't care about deficits we were lying all along we're gonna blow huge hole and our deficit and add trillions to our debt so that's the current Republican plan because they never cared so great job by Erin Burnett there and at least calling out Grover Norquist yeah you just watch the video by The Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
