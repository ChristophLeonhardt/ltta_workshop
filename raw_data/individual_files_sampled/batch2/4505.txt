the Cavanagh hearing expected for Monday has been consuming the Trump Whitehouse and Donald Trump's White House Counsel done McGann but meanwhile Bob Miller is moving ahead with key steps in the Russia probe in fact politicals Josh Gerstein has an interesting report that the man-of-war plea deal was really designed to be trump proof discouraging any later pardon for Paul Nana for Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani though says he's talked to mana for legal team as recently as this weekend after mana Ford's plea now the deal lets prosecutors go after mana Ford's forfeited assets at any time and even if his convictions were to be wiped out they can charge him immediately with other crimes now the mana fort is cooperating the details about these conversations can go right back to Bob Muller I'm joined by political Josh Gerson who reported on that interesting development as well as former Watergate prosecutor Nick Ackerman Josh how much of what you found is typical in what lawyers and prosecutors love to write which are all encompassing deals I mean anyone who's had to deal with a real estate contract and think about all the broad language and how much of it in your view reflects the specific prosecutorial aggressive strategy to counter this particular president well what I'd say Ari is you can probably find some version of just about every provision in this plea agreement in some other plea agreement that the Justice Department has written at some time in fact I suspect this is how was put together it's pretty common for prosecutors and lawyers for the government to cobble together these kinds of filings and these kinds of agreements from templates from other cases that said when you take the whole package together and the amounts of money involved it does seem like anything that manna fort may do to seek a pardon to seek remission of any fines or forfeitures that he suffers under this agreement would bring an enormous world of hurt down on his shoulders and that has raised some question for lawyers at both ends of the political spectrum some who are big fans of presidential power think it intrudes too far into the president's turf on making clemency decisions and those on the liberal side more focused on criminal justice reform think it's just a little too draconian to have it too and face those kinds of consequences for asking for some kind of relief right it's certainly a ton of bricks on top of Paul Manafort Nick when you look at this and you look at what they're setting out to do do you think that this decreases the likelihood of Donald Trump interfering I think this is basically pardon proof re if you look the real key here is the information that mr. Mandor Ford pled to this information is 38 pages plus it contains a number of exhibits I don't care how many templates they have in the Department of Justice never in my over 40 years of criminal practice as both a prosecutor and a defense lawyer have I ever seen an information that doesn't go the usual standard two or three pages I mean what they did what spell out what you're getting at is the that level of detail is effectively a huge public confession which can play out in all sorts of different ways and potentially with local authorities as well that's right he is admitted to every single fact in this document if somehow he were pardoned by the president all a state attorney general need do whether it's in New York or whether it's in Virginia on the tax violations they need only take this and use that to prosecute Paul Mann afford for state violations right because it's not like he went to those lengths to evade federal taxes and then paid every last state tax exactly and in New York State you have a very strict money laundering statute that probably has more onerous penalties than the federal statute and when you tie that together with this plea agreement the cooperation agreement it basically says the office and any other party other party could be any state attorney general will be free to use against your client directly and indirectly in any criminal proceeding that means a state proceeding as well as any other government proceeding so right there's all that affords yeah if afford Georgetown Law degree is worth anything it's worth understanding a little federalism concept that the states also get to prosecute regardless of any any Trump pardon if it were to materialize and so given that case which Nick lays out with prosecutorial zeal as we expect Nick in which josh has been reporting on I take the question more broadly back to you Josh which is it sometimes seems like Rudy Giuliani is doing fantasy football for this case on TV and then Bob Muller is just actually playing football and so Rudy's on TV so you know well maybe we could do this and maybe we do that and we're still in touch and maybe there'll be a pardon and that sounds fine for the length of a TV segment and we're not against TV segments around here but there is life outside of the four corners of this box and that's where you have Bob Muller playing real football do you think that's a fair way to look at it yeah I mean I think there's a lot of noise a lot of chaff that the White House throws up there that at the end of the day doesn't mean that much that said I'm still not sure that there will not be a pardon here I think that there's a decent chance because the question really is not so much whether the president might pardon man afford out of some kind of strategy where he thinks well if I do this they won't be able to use this or something good will happen I think it's more a question of pure retaliation against the Muller probe they can take their big trophy at this point and somehow up and the Gregg usually knock but you're saying something you're saying something very sad which is that because Donald Trump might treat the to pardon power like an angry tweet it's more likely to have a pardon even if it backfires on him I think so and remember you know the prosecutors they have manna forts story in various ways in the way that Nick just said that he stipulated to his story about himself but there's been probably a series of proper meetings already there could be more taking place as soon as this week and they have all that information now written down and usable in some form maybe they can even put them in front of a grand jury because I don't think the pardon will play out in the course of the next month or two it will probably come after the election or maybe even later on right although doing a pardon after someone has had all their proper sessions is a very incompetent way to do a potential interference hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our youtube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
