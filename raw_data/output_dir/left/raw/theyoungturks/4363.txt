1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,420
SO, CALIFORNIA EARLIER THIS WEEK
PASSED CAP AND TRADE.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,019
IT WAS AN EXTENSION OF EARLIER
LEGISLATION, IT WAS ABOUT TO GO

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:13,509
UNTIL 2020, AND WE ARE ALMOST
THERE, THEY EXTENDED IT TO 2030.

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:16,510
EDIT WAS A REALLY NICE MOMENT,
JERRY BROWN AND ARNOLD

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,119
SCHWARZENEGGER WERE TOGETHER,
AND THEY RAISED EACH OTHER'S

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,619
HANDS, BECAUSE ARNOLD IS ON THE
RIGHT SIDE OF THAT ISSUE.

7
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:27,929
TELUS ABOUT CAP AND TRADE, AND
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT.

8
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,510
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IT MAKES
JERRY BROWN ONE OF THE

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,020
PREMIER EXPERTS ON THIS ISSUE.

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,140
I KNOW THERE WAS SOME CRITICISM
OF THIS DETAIL OR THAT

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,590
DETAIL, BUT TO ACCOMPLISH THAT
WAS AMAZING.

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:51,120
AND HE GOT EIGHT REPUBLICAN
MEMBERS, AND REPUBLICAN

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,800
GOVERNORS AS WELL, TO ENDORSE
THE LEGISLATION, SO WHAT IT DOES

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,020
IS PUT A PRICE ON CARBON,
THROUGH THE CAP AND TRADE

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,559
MECHANISM.

16
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,750
IT GREATLY BENEFITS CANADA AS
WELL, BECAUSE ONTARIO HAS

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,409
JOINED, QU…BEC IS ñ QU…BEC HAS
ALREADY JOINED, ONTARIO IS ABOUT

18
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:11,409
TO.

19
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:12,409
MEXICO.

20
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:19,670
3 WEEKS AGO, I WAS IN AUSTRALIA,
AND I TOOK FOUR LETTERS FROM HIM

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,430
TO THE PREMIERES OF THE FOUR
LARGEST STATES IN AUSTRALIA ñ

22
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,420
IT'S THE SAME DEAL THERE, THEY
HAVE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT

23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,080
DOESN'T HAVE ITS ACT TOGETHER.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,540
SO, CALIFORNIA IS REALLY KIND OF
LEADING THE WAY IN THE U.S., BUT

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,409
YOU GOT A LOT OF OTHER STATES
TOO, SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

26
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,180
IS CAP AND TRADE THE RIGHT WAY
TO APPROACH THIS ISSUE?

27
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:50,220
IF I HAD MY DRUTHERS, I WOULD
HAVE A TAX ON CARBON, AND CAP

28
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,570
AND TRADE, AND A CERTAIN
PERCENTAGE GOING TOWARDS

29
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,850
RENEWABLES GOING UP EVERY YEAR.

30
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:04,550
BUT THE RESISTANCE, OF COURSE
BECAUSE OF HOW THE IDEOLOGICAL

31
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,580
ARGUMENT HAS BEEN SHAPED, MAKES
IT EASIER IN MOST JURISDICTIONS

32
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,420
TO GO FOR THE INDIRECT PRICE ON
CARBON, WHICH Added TRADE IS.

33
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,500
EVEN IN CHINA, BY THE WAY, I
HAVE A CLOSE FRIEND THERE WHO IS

34
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,380
THEIR TOP, GUY, WORKS FOR XI
JINPING, THEY FLOATED A CARBON

35
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,480
TAX IN CHINA COMMENTED A LOT OF
RESISTANCE FROM THE REGIONAL

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,480
INDUSTRIAL LEADERS ñ REQUESTED A
DICTATORSHIP, BUT NOT TOTALLY

37
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,190
ñ SO THEY DIVERTED TO A CAP AND
TRADE THERE AS WELL.

38
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,720
SWEDEN, PROBABLY DOING THE BEST
JOB OF ANY COUNTRY, HAS BOTH CAP

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,960
AND TRADE, AND A CARBON TAX, AND
EVENTUALLY I HOPE WE WILL HAVE A

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
CARBON TAX.

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,710
A REVENUE NEUTRAL CARBON TAX IS
SOMETHING I'VE SUPPORTED FOR

42
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,760
MORE THAN 25 YEARS, BUT WHEN I
REALIZED THAT WAS AN ALMOST

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,810
IMPOSSIBLE SELL, I SAID, OKAY,
SECOND BEST IS CAP AND

44
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,950
TRADE, LET'S DO THAT.

45
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,650
THE FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH HAD
DONE THAT TO STOP SULFUR

46
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,340
DIOXIDE, AND HELP CURE ACID
RAIN, AND IT WORKED, BETTER THAN

47
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,660
A LOT OF US EXPECTED IT WOULD.

48
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,180
SO I SAID LET'S DO THAT.

49
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,230
THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED THE
EFFORT, AND THE REPUBLICAN

50
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,400
AUTHORS OF THE FIRST CAP AND
TRADE PLAN IMMEDIATELY

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,880
SWITCHED, AND SAID YOU ARE FOR
IT?

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
WE ARE NOW AGAINST IT.

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,750
NOT SAYING THAT TO ME, BUT TO
THE DEMOCRATS.

54
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,920
WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT MOVIE
BEFORE?

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,840
HERITAGE FOUNDATION PROPOSED A
HEALTHCARE PLAN BEFORE.

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:00:00,000
SAME THING, GOOD CATCH.
