AINSLEY: A STORY NO ONE IS
TELLING YOU ABOUT HAPPENING
ARE REALLY UP AGAINST ON A
DAILY BASIS.
>> AS I HAVE ALWAYS TOLD
PEOPLE, BORDER SECURITY IS
NATIONAL SECURITY.
OUR PEOPLE STARTED CHANGING
DIAPERS.
THEM.
I MEAN, THINGS THAT WE
NORMALLY DON'T EXPECT OF OUR
LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE TO
DO, THAT'S WHAT OUR AGENTS
DO.
STEVE: EACH AND EVERY DAY.
SHE JOINS US FROM L.A.
YOU WATCH A LOT OF THE
CHANNELS AND THESE GUYS WHO
PATROL OUR BORDER ARE MADE
OUT TO BE MONSTERS.
BUT PEOPLE.
WHEN THEY SEE A BABY, THEY
TRY TO HELP THE BABY.
AS THAT GUY JUST SAID.
>> YEAH.
FIRST AND FOREMOST, THEY ARE
HUMANITARIANS.
AND, OF COURSE, THEIR JOB
AND DUTY IS TO PROTECT OUR
BORDER.
COME HERE ILLEGALLY THAT WAS
THE MOST WONDERFUL THING I
DISCOVERED ON MY TRIP TO THE
BORDER THAT THESE AGENTS
EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE
THAT I MET CARED ABOUT
PEOPLE FIRST, ABOVE ANYTHING
ELSE, THAT WAS THEIR
PRIORITY.
AND, IN MANY CASES, THESE
-D
--FAMILIES AND CHILDREN ARE
THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS
THEMSELVES.
THEY ARE OUT THERE MAKING
SURE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE
TO THEIR FAMILIES.
OUR BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE
INTERVIEW NOW?
>> LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
IF WE DO NOT APPLY CONS -- THIS
BORDER IS A VERY DANGEROUS
PLACE.
I HEARD THE COMMENT PEOPLE
OUTRAGED WHAT THIS
ADMINISTRATION AND WHAT WE
ARE DOING IN PARTICULAR.
BUT WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE FOR
THE PUBLIC AGAINST SOME OF
THESE PARENTS WHO ARE TAKING
THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH THE
DESSERT IN EXTREME HEAT,
VERY VIOLENT AREAS AND
PLACING THEM IN THE HANDS OF
SMUGGLERS, THAT'S WHERE THE
OUTRAGE NEEDS TO BE.
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND MOMS
BRINGING THEIR BABIES OVER.
DRUGS?
DID YOU SEE ANY OF THAT?
>> REALLY A COMBINATION OF
ALL THOSE THINGS.
PARTICULARLY WHERE I WAS IN
COURSE, THEY DEAL WITH IT
EACH AND EVERY SINGLE DAY
THEY ARE SEEING DRUG
SMUGGLERS AND COYOTES,
THAT'S THEIR BIGGEST FEAR
THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE
BEING PLACED IN THE HANDS OF
A TRAFFICKERS AND THE DRUG
SMUGGLERS.
SO, WHAT THEY TOLD ME WAS
THE LAST TWO WEEKS.
AND THE DEHUMANIZATION AND
VILIFICATION OF OUR BORDER
PATROL AGENTS FOR FAMILY
SEPARATION.
MANY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND
A LOT OF TIMES THESE AGENTS
ARE SEPARATING FAMILIES
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT TRUE
FAMILY UNITS MANY TIMES THEY
LIKE THE HUMANITARIANS THAT
THEY ARE.
NOT ONLY STOPPING CRIME BUT
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE SAFE
AND TAKEN CARE OF.
MAINSTREAM MEDIA NETWORKS.
STEVE: YOU ARE RIGHT.
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT ANGLE
ONE TIME UNTIL THIS MORNING.
TOMI LAHREN THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US FROM L.A. AND
GOING DOWN TO THE BORDER FOR
US.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I THANK ALL THE BORDER
PATROL AGENTS OUT THERE EACH
