00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:21,612
AND TESTER STARTED THROWING

9
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:23,180
OUT THINGS THAT HE'S HEARD.

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,615
I KNOW THINGS ABOUT TESTER

11
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:26,150
THAT I COULD SAY, TOO.

12
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,218
AND IF I SAID THEM, HE WOULD

13
00:00:28,218 --> 00:00:32,756
NEVER BE ELECTED AGAIN.

14
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:33,257
BRIAN: RIGHT.

15
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:33,824
STEVE: WHAT ARE THEY?

SUCCESSFUL PODCAST.

WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU

22
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:44,868
HEARD THAT LINE?

23
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:49,106
NUMBER ONE I KNOW YOU KNOW

24
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:49,506
DR. JACKSON.

25
00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:50,240
NOT ONLY IS HE NOT GOING TO

26
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,643
BE THE NEXT V.A. SECRETARY.

27
00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:53,510
NOT GOING TO GET A HEARING

28
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,545
AND NO LONGER AT THE WHITE

29
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:54,845

30
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:56,580
KNOWING THAT AND TESTER CAME

31
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,550
OUT WITH INNUENDOS AND

32
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,217
ALLEGATIONS, WHAT DO YOU

00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:01,819

00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:03,187
>> WELL, I WILL TELL WHAT

35
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:04,721

36
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:07,658
TESTER SHOULD RESIGN, BRIAN,

37
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:08,025
YESTERDAY.

38
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:09,426
A ZAP, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

39
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:11,361
THE MAN DISGRACED HIMSELF.

40
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:12,296
HE DISGRACED THE UNITED

41
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:12,729
STATES SENATE.

42
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,898
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, MOST

43
00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:16,467
CRITICALLY, HE HAS DISGRACED

44
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:17,734
AN AMERICAN PATRIOT.

45
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:18,635
A GOOD MAN.

46
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:19,937
A FRIEND BUT I SAY THIS NOT

47
00:01:19,937 --> 00:01:21,105
OUT OF A SENSE OF

48
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:22,206
FRIENDSHIP, BRIAN, I MEAN.

49
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:23,574
THIS I WANT TO BE CLEAR.

50
00:01:23,574 --> 00:01:25,509
NO ONE HAS ASKED ME TO SAY

51
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:26,276
ANYTHING RONNY JACKSON.

52
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:28,412
NOT RONNY, NOT A FRIEND OF

53
00:01:28,412 --> 00:01:28,745
RONNY'S.

54
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:30,147
NOT HIS FAMILY.

55
00:01:30,147 --> 00:01:31,315
NOBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

56
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:32,950
THIS WAS A MAN I KNEW

57
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,350
PERSONALLY.

58
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,519
THIS WAS A MAN WHO SAVED MY

59
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,854
BUTT MANY TIMES WHEN I WAS

60
00:01:36,854 --> 00:01:38,388
SICK OVERSEAS IN THE SECRET

61
00:01:38,388 --> 00:01:38,722
SERVICE.

62
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:40,624
ALL OF THESE ALLEGATIONS, I

63
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:41,592
HAVE NEVER, BRIAN, I WAS THE

64
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:42,693
LAW ENFORCEMENT GUY ON THE

65
00:01:42,693 --> 00:01:43,026
GROUND.

66
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:44,428
WHEN THERE WAS SOME KIND OF

67
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:45,629
PROBLEM ON A VISIT WITH THE

68
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:46,630
DOCTOR OR SOMEONE IN THE

69
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,132
MILITARY OR ANYONE ELSE, ME

70
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:50,167
AS A SECRET SERVICE MAN I

71
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,235
WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED.

72
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:52,803
I NEVER SAW ANY OF THIS.

73
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:53,937
THIS IS A JOKE AND THIS WAS

74
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:55,506
A POLITICAL HIT JOB OF THE

75
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:56,507
HIGHEST ORDER.

76
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:58,609
STEVE: THERE WERE THOSE TWO

77
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:00,644
PAGES OF CIRCUMSTANTIALLY

78
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:01,879
OPPO RESEARCH THAT TESTER

79
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,447
APPARENTLY WAS RELYING UPON.

80
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:05,649
A LOT OF STUFF WAS EASY TO

81
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:06,350
CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT IT

82
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,151
WAS TRUE.

83
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:08,551
IN FACT, OVER THE WEEKEND, I

84
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:09,353
THINK THE WHITE HOUSE AND

85
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:10,821
THE SECRET SERVICE CAME OUT

86
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:12,623
AND SAID YEAH, YOU KNOW

87
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:13,490
WHAT, HE NEVER ACTUALLY DID

88
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,191
CRASH THAT CAR.

89
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:15,492
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF

90
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:16,059
THAT.

91
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:17,227
BUT THE INSINUATION THAT HE

92
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:19,062
WAS GIVING OUT PILLS LIKE --

93
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:20,330
THEY CALLED HIM THE CANDY

94
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:20,597
MAN.

95
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:22,399
WHEN YOU ARE AN AN OVERSEAS

96
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,568
TRIP AND YOU ARE 10 TIMES

97
00:02:24,568 --> 00:02:25,369
ZONES OFF.

98
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:27,671
I'M SURE EVERYBODY IN YOUR

99
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:29,306
DETAIL PROBABLY ASKED FOR A

100
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:30,841
SLEEP AID.

101
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:32,576
>> YOU KNOW, STEVE, LET ME

102
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,178

103
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:35,679

105
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:37,414
THIS IS THE REAL WORLD, YOU

00:02:37,414 --> 00:02:37,748
CHUMPS.

107
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:38,615
THIS IS NOT A COLLEGE

108
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:39,349
CAMPUS, OKAY?

109
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:40,784
YOU DON'T GET TO GO TO A CRY

110
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:42,419
ROOM AND CRY IT OUT BECAUSE

111
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:43,287
THE PROFESSOR YELLED AT YOU

112
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:44,888
OR A CONSERVATIVE SPEAKER IS

113
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:45,289
ON CAMPUS.

114
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,356
IN THE REAL WORLD IN THE

115
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:47,291
SECRET SERVICE IN THE

116
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,592
MILITARY, WHEN YOU GO TO A

117
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:49,927
FOREIGN HOT ZONE TO KEEP THE

118
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:51,061
PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY

119
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:52,729
ALIVE AND YOU CAN'T SLEEP,

120
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:54,264
YOU CAN'T PROTECT THIS GUY,

121
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:55,832
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?

122
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:57,100
PEOPLE COULD DIE OR GET

123
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,401
HURT.

124
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,035
SO THE FACT THAT YOU MAY

00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,140
GET YOUR BUTT UP AND KEEP

128
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,874

00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:18,922
I'M SICK OF THIS CASE.

142
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:20,457
I NEVER SEEN A BETTER MAN

143
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:22,726
TAKEN DOWN BY A MORE

144
00:03:22,726 --> 00:03:23,627
DISGUSTING GROUP OF PEOPLE

145
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:24,928
IN MY LIFE.

146
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,296
AINSLEY: THAT'S WHAT THE

147
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:27,764
AMERICAN PUBLIC IS UPSET

148
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:28,065
ABOUT.

149
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:29,233
I DON'T KNOW HIM PERSONALLY

150
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:29,800
YOU DO.

151
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,369
AND EVERYONE WHO KNOWS HIM

152
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:38,008
HAVE ONE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT

153
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:38,275
HIM.

154
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:38,942
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR

155
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:39,576
REPUTATION, YOU GIVE OUT A

156
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:40,244
FEW PILLS AND THEN YOU HAVE

157
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:41,111
THE CANDY MAN LOGO AND START

158
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:42,479
LOOKING AT YOUR BACKGROUND

159
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,281
AND DRIVING RECORD.

160
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:45,616
DAN DAN AINSLEY, HE HAD NO

161
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:46,683
CHANCE TO CORRECT IT.

162
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:48,018
THE LIE TRAVELED AROUND THE

163
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:49,086
WORLD BEFORE RONNY GOT TO

164
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:51,221
EVEN OPEN HIS MOUTH.

165
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,189
I ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO

166
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:55,292

HONORABLE GUY.

00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,033
READ ABOUT WHAT HE WROTE

174
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:03,767
ABOUT RONNY JACKSON.

175
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,402
HE HAD NO REASON TO PUT HIS

176
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:07,971
HE IS NOT THAT KIND OF GUY,

177
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:08,272
MIKE.

178
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:09,573
DID HE IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE

179
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:11,575
KIND OF GUY HE WAS.

180
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:12,643
BRIAN: NOT ONLY GET THE JOB

181
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:13,710

00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:30,327

00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:31,822
A LITTLE BIT MORE FORCEFUL.

232
00:05:31,822 --> 00:05:32,823
HE IS DOING THE DANCE UP

RESIGNED OVER THE WEEKEND.

241
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:44,468
