the first day for the Senate confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh has begun and a number of things happened during the first day that I want to touch on today first off there were a number of protests that took place but the loudest protest was actually conducted by Senate Democrats now understand that Democrats have very little power in preventing the confirmation of Brett Brett Kavanaugh but one thing the Democrats were asking for from the get-go was access to extensive files records documents pertaining to previous judgments that Cavanaugh has made and Republicans have fought them tooth and nail on that very subject now what you're about to see is how it all unfolded on the first day of the confirmation hearings and it did get pretty dramatic take a look to serve as associate justice mr. chairman before we proceed mr. chairman I'd like to be recognized to ask a question before we proceed the committee received just last night let's say 15 hours ago 4,000 pages of documents that we have not had an opportunity to review or read or analyze you are you're out of order I'll proceed mr. chairman mr. chairman revenues were deal offers and documents that we have and everyone else join me tonight and we believe this hearing should know the sermon if we cannot be recognized I move to adjourn the American people Chairman I move to adjourn directly in judge mr. Chairman I move to adjourn mr. Chairman I appeal to the chair to recognize myself or one of my colleagues you're out of order mr. Chairman I appeal to be recognized on your sense of decency and integrity even the documents you have requested mr. chairman even the ones that you said the limited documents you have requested this committee has not received and the documents we have you sir have should be transparent this committee sir is a violation of even the values I've heard you talked about time and time again the ideals that we should have what is the rush what are we trying to hide by not having the documents out front so the integrity of the documents we've received there really is no integrity they have alterations of oddities attachments are missing emails are cut off halfway through a chain recipient stains are missing sir we just got a document dumped last night over 40,000 pages I would venture to say not one senator here has had time to read through those 40,000 pages so just quickly for context Mitch McConnell was iffy on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh because of his past and what I mean by that is Kavanagh has served as a judge for quite some time he worked with Ken Starr to impeach Bill Clinton so the reason why Republicans have fought against allowing Democrats to see all these documents ahead of time is because it would further complicate the confirmation process that's why Mitch McConnell didn't really like him as a Supreme Court nominee now with that said Democrats finally got access to the documents that they asked for but as Senator Harris said in that in that clip they didn't really get it until 15 hours prior to the confirmation confirmation hearings beginning so yeah so and there's layers upon layers of this there are a great number of documents that were coerced by the by the Democrats that are in the archives and and they won't get access to all those the bush lawyers because he worked for Bush are withholding some and then when they pass it on the Trump Trump's people are withholding others and redacting him that's why they have a complete record the 42,000 they got in the middle of the night last night is not nearly all the records but at least it's something extra but they gave no chance to look at it how could you possibly read 42,000 pages even if you had a team of people doing it in 15 hours overnight that that makes no sense these are the same Republicans who said oh my god the health care bill under Obama was so large nobody got a chance to read it now they pull this thought so look there are things that I can abide by the things I can people are all now concerned that there was too much fighting and interrupting in this proceeding I am not worried about that at all they should fight and Republicans fought they fought to the nail to make sure that Merrick garland never sat on the Supreme Court they fought for a year they did every legislative and procedural trick in the book to do that so I I don't mind the republics fighting back against the Democrats in this proceedings that's not an issue what I cannot abide is people like Ben Sasse and and I've said some positive things about him and called him classy Ben Sasse said he has been honest about in regards to Trump and he did that again recently when in protecting the rule of law but in this case he said the question before us is can Cavanaugh put aside his policy views I'm going to quote here and political preferences put them in a box marked irrelevant and set it aside every morning when he puts on that black robe , who are you kidding you you're telling us that Cavanaugh was one of the most conservative guys ever nominated the Supreme Court was a deeply political partisan operative under Bush and others and on the ken starr investigation is gonna put aside his political opinions please don't don't insult our intelligence whether you're public and conservative liberal Democrat everybody knows every one of those judges both conservative and liberal bring their political opinions to the court everybody knows that it's preposterous as stupid to argue otherwise it is stupid to argue otherwise because there's already evidence as to how Cavanaugh will conduct himself so the Federalist Society has promoted him endorsed him has included him on the list of potential Supreme Court nominees for Donald Trump the federal society is very clear about their objective they want conservative activist judges they believe that conservative politicians primarily the President of the United States should specifically look for and promote and nominate conservative judges who will carry out their ideology while they serve on the Supreme Court so again if this is a federal Society pick which Kavanagh is then of course he's gonna be an activist judge of course he's gonna promote conservative ideology so I gotta jump in on that too because look the Republicans always say no more suitors what does that mean George HW Bush picked Souter and it turned out that he wasn't as politically conservatives people thought he was and he wound up siding with the the liberals on the court a decent amount of the time and so they're like I gotta make sure that never happens then what does that mean that clearly means I want a guy who was politically conservative it's and why do you think that the right-wing evangelicals are celebrating Cavanaugh now and they're so excited by him because he's not going to overturn Roe vs. Wade no they believe that he is going to overturn Roe vs. Wade because that is his politics now when it comes to judicial principles well Anna's right he's he would have to be an activist judge and he has shown in the past that he is to overturn precedent now Roe vs. Wade is a precedent that is decades old but Cavanaugh has shown in previous rulings that he would consider overturning that precedent why he claims he's conservative judicially if you're a conservative issue you would not overturn that precedent you would only do it if you're a conservative politically and you don't have to guess in fact even one of the documents that we got there's a quote from Cavanaugh because he helped the Bush administration pick judges so he said at the time and and Sheldon Whitehouse Democratic senator summarizes it this way he coached judicial nominees to just tell senators that quote this is now Cavanaugh's quote that they will adhere to statutory text and they have no ideological agenda and White House has fairy tales so Kavanaugh literally coached other people to go and deceive senators by saying oh my god Oh golly gee I would never take politics into account he's the one who wrote that playbook so spare me crocodile tears about politics he was appointed because of politics and he will be deeply political on the Supreme Court two easy ways for the young
