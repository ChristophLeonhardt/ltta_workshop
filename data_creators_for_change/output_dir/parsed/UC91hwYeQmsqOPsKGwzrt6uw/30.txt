shirt already all right come on let's
hold hands he goes straight to the visor
come on guys this way that glue stick so
for your eyes birthday we took the kids
to wonder spaces I think our thoughts
behind this was to give the kids an
experience they most likely would never
have what I learned was taking kids to a
museum and telling them not to touch
anything is a little bit inhumane now
they really enjoyed themselves like for
real but mostly because they were
together you know you Ryan leave I care
so much about each other it really
amazes me how simple the kids are they
really care about their community and
the resonates funny because sometimes I
forget how important Pilar around so
this is just a reminder sometimes it's
not about what you're doing but who
you're doing it with
and when you and let it and bow oh you
got this buddy you got it you got it you
got it you got it I can't hold you it's
too far I'm not tall enough
