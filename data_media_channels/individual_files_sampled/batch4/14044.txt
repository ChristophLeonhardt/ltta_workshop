lately she's now painting herself as the victim look at this Loretto tweet from Wednesday quote one thanks to everyone for the support I have so much yo say about the far-right manufacturers hate online and all I can say as well no one deserves this even if what day something do respectful which bTW I didn't even Wow what hoop levels first that she has the audacity to paint herself as a victim due to her own grotesque comments and secondly given that she so frequently violates the rules inherent to grammar spelling and syntax this person is a professional writer meanwhile the media party is going to bat for this ghoul in a statement issued by the taxpayer-subsidized Maclean's magazine the periodical states that it does not wish to quote feed into the torrent of abuse miss Loretto has been subjected to since publishing her tweet and quote well to quote Loretto herself Wow joining me now with more on this nauseating sidebar to the Humboldt tragedy is as relevant so Ezra are we now supposed to believe that it is Nora Loreto who is the victim as opposed to the 16 who perished in that horrific accident yeah and you know I did my monologue on this earlier this week and I mean the first question I was asking myself is why am I even talking about this crank I mean there's 300 million users on Twitter there's 2 billion people on Facebook so you're gonna find some kook some nuts some people who will do or say anything for attention and boy Nora Loreto has never had this much attention to her whole life so is that a reason to criticize her and in my mind no other than for two things first of all she was a star writer for McClain's The Globe and Mail The Walrus CBC so she although you and I find her disgusting and beyond the pale she was a fixture she wasn't on but she would get op-eds placed with all these mainstream media outlets so the first point is we see her as some gross troll on on Twitter but she's actually in the in the heart of the mainstream media so the first thing is she's not just some nobody the second thing is how the media has either been silent or a little bit supportive of her I see a bunch of journalists on Twitter saying oh how dare McLean's try and distance himself because MacLean said oh she's being subject to abuse but by the way she was never on staff here she was just an op-ed writer right and all these journalists are coming to her defense and that's actually the grosser thing yeah is that what she said pointing out the oh they're just white men what was factually wrong yeah they're Aboriginal kids there was a young woman who was killed but even if it was factually true for her in the midst of this grief while the families are burying their dead and and the red was white herself I mean if she hates herself so much it's in her own hands um my point is what she said the anti-white racism the anti male chauvinism that political correct post modernist Marxism the mainstream media 100% agrees with that David they just probably wouldn't have been so gross about it or or so blunt just days after this traffic tragedy they would have been more subtle and more thoughtful in their expression of it but I don't think a single person in The Globe and Mail the CBC The Walrus or these other left-wing mainstream media fundamentally object to what she said they just objected the fact that she did it so rudely hey that was an excerpt from my show rebel roundup where we discussed the week's top stories with your favorite rebels to see my show and more sign up to become a Premium Member today you
