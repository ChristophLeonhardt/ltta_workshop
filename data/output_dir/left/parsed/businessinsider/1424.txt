what goes through my head when I'm going
to take a game-winning shot is I better
make it I'm pretty confident whatever
shot I'm going to take in that situation
is a shot that I've taken many times in
practice so you let the muscle memory
and the repetition of what I do take
over
mr. normal practice I probably get up by
300 shots during the summer and kind of
up that up to about 500 when I'm
actually working on my game trying it
better
just have a have ultimate confidence in
making that shot
