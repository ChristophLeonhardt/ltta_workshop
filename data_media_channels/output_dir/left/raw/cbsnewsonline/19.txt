1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,339
SLEEP DEPRIVATION, WHICH COULD 

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:10,510
CAUSE DEMENTIA, 10 OR 20 YEARS 

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,378
FROM NOW, TO WHERE I WOULD NOT 

4
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:13,346
EVEN REMEMBER MY SON'S NAME. 

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,849
I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REMEMBER 

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,518
HIS NAME FROM A MIXED DIAGNOSIS.

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:24,457
WE CAN EMPOWER THE 

8
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,191
PHARMACEUTICALS AND MAKE MORE 

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:25,558
MONEY. 

10
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,727
I HAVE NEVER STEPPED INTO A 

11
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:28,495
SITUATION WHERE I DIDN'T MAKE 

12
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,095
PEOPLE MORE MONEY. 

13
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,365
WE CAN EMPOWER PHARMACEUTICALS, 

14
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,466
EMPOWER INDUSTRY. 

15
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,934
EMPOWER FACTORIES. 

16
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:39,372
NOT ONLY BRING ADIDAS ONSHORE, 

17
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,943
BUT FOX CAN'T SET UP A FACTORY 

18
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:44,109
DAY 

19
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:44,811
>> IN WISCONSIN. 

20
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:45,178
WISCONSIN. 

21
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:50,783
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED IS 

22
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:52,519
FOR FORD TO HAVE THE BEST 

23
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,321
DESIGN, THE DOPE LIST CARS. 

24
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,891
I DON'T USUALLY SAY DOPE. 

25
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:03,897
I LIKE TO FLIP THEM. 

26
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,434
THE MOST AMAZING CAR. 

27
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:09,869
WHAT WE WANT TO START WITH, I 

28
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,471
BROUGHT THIS WITH ME, RIGHT 

29
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:11,804
HERE. 

30
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:18,478
THIS IS A HYDROGEN POWERED 

31
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,048
AIRPLANE. 

32
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:22,681
THIS IS WHAT OUR PRESIDENT 

33
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:24,117
SHOULD BE FLYING IN. 

34
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,787
LOOK AT THIS. 

35
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,255
>> CAN WE GET RID OF AIR FORCE 

36
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:29,455
ONE? 

37
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:30,456
I LIKE THAT. 

38
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:32,425
>> WE WILL HAVE APPLE, AN 

39
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,360
AMERICAN COMPANY, WORK ON THIS 

40
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,429
AIRPLANE WITH US. 

41
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:42,602
WHAT I NEED SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 

42
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,038
TO IMPROVE ON, IF HE DON'T LOOK 

43
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,675
GOOD, WE DON'T LOOK GOOD. 

44
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,475
THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT. 

45
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:50,810
HE HAS TO BE THE FRESHEST, THE 

46
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,711
FLY ASKED. 

47
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:55,415
THE BEST FACTORIES. 

48
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,349
WE HAVE TO EMPOWER OR CORE. 

49
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,084
WE HAVE TO BRING JOBS INTO 

50
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:01,120
AMERICA, BECAUSE OUR BEST 

51
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,691
EXPORT IS ENTERTAINMENT AND 

52
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,158
IDEAS. 

53
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,459
BUT WHEN WE MAKE EVERYTHING IN 

54
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,161
CHINA AND NOT AMERICA, WE ARE 

55
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:08,661
CHEATING OUR COUNTRY. 

56
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:09,729
WE ARE PUTTING PEOPLE IN 

57
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,398
POSITIONS TO HAVE TO DO ILLEGAL 

58
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,968
THINGS AND END UP IN THE PRISON 

59
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,268
SYSTEM. 

60
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:23,243
>> I TELL YOU WHAT, I HATE TO 

61
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,644
SAY THIS, JIM, DO YOU WANT TO 

62
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,011
SAY SOMETHING? 

63
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,512
HOW DO YOU GO AFTER THAT? 

64
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:29,182
PLEASE, JIM. 

65
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,483
PLEASE. 

66
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,519
GREAT, RIGHT? 

67
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,757
ISN'T THAT A GREAT SALE? 

68
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,691
IT IS SO TRUE. 

69
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,194
AS A COUNTRY. 

70
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,529
SO TRUE. 

71
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:44,897
I HAVE NEVER SEEN JIM BROWN 

72
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:45,297
IMPRESSED BEFORE. 

73
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:46,399
IT IS TRUE. 

74
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,203
THAT IS AMAZING. 

75
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,804
I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT IS GREAT 

76
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,039
TO HAVE YOU GUYS WITH US. 

77
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,176
WE ARE GOING TO GO AND HAVE 

78
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:57,944
SOME LUNCH. 

79
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:58,578
THAT WAS QUITE SOMETHING. 

80
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:02,148
THAT WAS QUITE SOMETHING. 

81
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,884
IT WAS REALLY, REALLY VERY 

82
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,085
INTERESTING. 

83
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:10,323
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, CAN WE STILL 

84
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,660
HEAR THE REST OF THIS? 

85
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,028
THIS IS PRESIDENT BUSH THEY ARE 

86
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,029
TALKING ABOUT, CAN WE JUST 

87
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:16,796
LISTEN? 

88
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:20,400
>> I THINK WE NEED TO CARE ABOUT

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,301
ALL PEOPLE AND I BELIEVE WHEN I 

90
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:28,741
WENT ON NBC I WAS VERY 

91
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:29,642
EMOTIONAL AND PROGRAMMED TO 

92
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:30,776
THINK FROM A VICTIMIZED 

93
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:31,611
MENTALITY. 

94
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:37,082
I THINK WITH BLACKS AND AFRICAN-

95
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:37,950
AMERICANS, WE REALLY GET CAUGHT 

96
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,155
UP IN THE IDEA OF RACISM. IF 

97
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,523
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE LAND, THEY 

98
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:48,461
SETTLE FOR GRANTS. 

99
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:53,132
WE WANT TO SUPPORT OBAMA AGAIN, 

100
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,202
WE WANT A BRAND, MORE THAN LAND,

101
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,704
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT 

102
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,473
FEELS TO HAVE OUR OWN LAND, 

103
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:05,578
OWNERSHIP OF OUR OWN BLOCKS. 

104
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,846
IF YOU DON'T HAVE OWNERSHIP, IT 

105
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:07,947
IS ALL ABOUT HOW SOMETHING 

106
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:08,180
LOOKS. 

107
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,382
IT IS ABOUT THE PATINA, NOT THE 

108
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:09,582
CORE. 

109
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,518
SO WE FOCUS ON WHAT WE ARE 

110
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,920
WEARING OR THE IDEA OF SOMEONE 

111
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,189
BEING RACIST. 

112
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,089
WE TALK ABOUT POLICE MURDERS, 

113
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,726
WHICH WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO. 

114
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,396
WE HAVE TO BRING NOBILITY TO 

115
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,597
THE POLICE OFFICERS. 

116
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:29,068
POLICE OFFICERS ARE JUST LIKE 

117
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,303
US, BUT THERE IS THIS HATE 

118
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:30,603
BUILDING. 

119
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,873
THAT IS A MAJOR THING ABOUT 

120
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:34,440
RACIAL TENSION. 

121
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,441
ALSO, AS BLACK PEOPLE, WE HAVE 

122
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,479
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT 

123
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:39,912
WE ARE DOING. 

124
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,681
WE KILL EACH OTHER MORE THAN 

125
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,084
POLICE OFFICERS. 

126
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,219
THAT IS NOT SAYING THAT THE 

127
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:46,986
POLICE OFFICERS ARE NOT AT 

128
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,388
ISSUE, BECAUSE THEY ARE IN A 

129
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,255
POSITION OF POWER, BUT 

130
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:55,161
SOMETIMES THEY ARE -- IT SHOULD 

131
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,196
NOT BE FORCED VERSUS POWER. 

132
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,500
YOU SHOULDN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO 

133
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,033
DO THAT. 

134
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,068
THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO DO 

135
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,202
THIS, FORCED TO DO THAT. 

136
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,171
WE HAVE TO RELEASE THE LOVE, 

137
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,506
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY 

138
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:10,843
AND GIVE OPPORTUNITIES. 

139
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,412
A LOT OF TIMES IT IS THE 

140
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:18,518
OVERALL LACK OF REPARATIONS 

141
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,786
THAT AT ANY GIVEN POINT, WE SAY 

142
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,187
THIS IS RACIST, THIS IS RACIST, 

143
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,655
THIS IS RACIST. 

144
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,556
WE DON'T HAVE REPARATIONS, BUT 

145
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,658
WE HAVE THE 13th AMENDMENT. 

146
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,059
WE NEED TO OPEN THE WHOLE 

147
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:31,497
CONVERSATION. 

148
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,798
ONE OF THE MOVES THAT I LOVE 

149
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:34,066
THAT LIBERALS TRY TO DO, A 

150
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,234
LIBERAL WILL TRY TO CONTROL A 

151
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,169
BLACK PERSON THROUGH THE 

152
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,003
CONCEPT OF RACISM, BECAUSE THEY 

153
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,405
KNOW WE ARE PROUD AND EMOTIONAL 

154
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:39,638
PEOPLE. 

155
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:47,080
SO WHEN I SAY I LIKE TRUMP, HE 

156
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,214
WILL SAY HE IS RACIST. 

157
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,415
YOU THINK THAT WILL CONTROL ME? 

158
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,750
THAT WON'T STOP NOTHING, AN 

159
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,418
INVISIBLE WALL. 

160
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,120
YOU HAVE ONE QUESTION, LET'S GO 

161
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,191
TO ANOTHER QUESTION. 

162
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,192
I DON'T ANSWER QUESTIONS AND 

163
00:05:59,192 --> 00:05:59,826
SIMPLE SOUND BITES. 

164
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:07,834
>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 

165
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,668
KANYE WEST MEETING WITH 

166
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,068
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

167
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:09,935
TALKING ABOUT PRISON REFORM, 

168
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,070
THE 13th AMENDMENT, WHICH 

169
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,405
ABOLISHED SLAVERY IN THE UNITED 

170
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:12,638
STATES. 

171
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:17,210
I WANT TO BRING IN CAITLIN HUEY-

172
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,710
BURNS. 

173
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,311
RACISM, PRISON REFORM, 

174
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:18,678
PRESIDENT BUSH. 

175
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,613
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE 

176
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,748
JUST HEARD? 

177
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,050
>> A LOT TO UNPACK AND IT SEEMS 

178
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,484
LIKE THAT CONVERSATION WENT ON 

179
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:28,788
LONGER. 

180
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:29,989
THE FACT THAT KANYE WEST IS IN 

181
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,224
THE OVAL OFFICE IS NOT 

182
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:31,891
SOMETHING NEW FOR THIS 

183
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,059
PRESIDENT, IN TERMS OF HIS 

184
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:33,626
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. 

185
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,794
HE WENT TO TRUMP TOWER DURING 

186
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,195
THE TRANSITION TO MEET WITH 

187
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:36,496
HIM. 

188
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,298
OF COURSE KIM KARDASHIAN MET 

189
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:42,068
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WAS 

190
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,171
SUCCESSFUL GETTING A CHANGE IN 

191
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:51,744
THE SENTENCE OF SOMEONE SHE WAS 

192
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,912
ADVOCATING TWO. 

193
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,545
THE PRESIDENT WAS RESPONSIVE TO 

194
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:54,647
HER AND HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE TO 

195
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:54,947
KANYE WEST. 

196
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:59,518
HE POINTS TO KANYE WEST AS AN 

197
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:00,553
EXAMPLE OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN 

198
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,387
COMMUNITY AND HE LIKES TO TALK 

199
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,889
AT RALLIES ABOUT HOW HE IS 

200
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,323
DOING WELL WITH VARIOUS 

201
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:04,791
CONSTITUENCIES. 

202
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,158
WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT 

203
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,126
THIS PRESIDENT, FOR A LONG 

204
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,761
TIME, HE WAS PART OF THE 

205
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,595
CELEBRITY CULTURE. 

206
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,398
OFTENTIMES NOW THAT HE IS 

207
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:17,503
OFFICIALLY INVOLVED IN 

208
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,738
POLITICS, HE HAS BEEN STUNNED 

209
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:19,238
BY THAT COMMUNITY AND 

210
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,139
CELEBRITIES HAVE BEEN VERY 

211
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,076
ACTIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE, 

212
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:24,509
OPPOSING TRUMP. 

213
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,678
SO HE OFTEN POINTS TO KANYE 

214
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:26,979
WEST OR OTHERS WHO HAVE COME 

215
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:32,718
OUT IN SUPPORT OF HIM TO COMBAT 

216
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:33,853
THE CRITICISM THAT HE DOES GET 

217
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,654
FROM MOST OF HOLLYWOOD. 

218
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,454
>> A LOT THERE. 

219
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,455
