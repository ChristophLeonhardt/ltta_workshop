00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
hi guys so today I'm going to talk about

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of books that I've read recently</font>

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,920
starting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> two by Don DeLillo I've</font>

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,359
never read anything by Don DeLillo

5
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,330
before then I read white noise and

6
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">cosmopolis I had two completely</font>

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,139
different reactions to each of them a

8
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,030
lot of students in red white noise in

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,379
the high school classroom he's very

10
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,080
popular American postmodern alpha who

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'd never heard of in my life starting</font>

12
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,650
with white noise I really really loved

13
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,359
it it followed a couple both of whom

14
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,650
were completely paranoid about death

15
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,930
overtime can you be paranoid about<font color="#E5E5E5"> death</font>

16
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,970
I mean it's kind of persecuting you and

17
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,250
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really an irrational fear faced</font>

18
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a situation in which death suddenly</font>

19
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,520
becomes very immediate and real and

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,410
tangible in a way that it hasn't before

21
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,940
and the reaction to it is somewhat

22
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,399
unexpected it's an extremely postmodern

23
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,870
Texas all sorts of postmodern

24
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,670
conventions and relative poking fun at

25
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,800
the academy which I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font>

26
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,660
love for example the protagonist<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

27
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,399
pioneer in the field of hitter studies

28
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,379
and yet can't speak German there's all

29
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,879
sorts of discontinuities throughout

30
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,079
which make these very familiar

31
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,030
situations of reacting to disaster

32
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,370
diseases you can't see the medical world

33
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,280
doctors hospitals and very very familiar

34
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,960
fear of death seemed suddenly very

35
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,880
unfamiliar and very d familiarized by

36
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,740
these slightly absurdist and peculiar

37
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,240
characters<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very well</font>

38
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,890
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I liked it a lot so it's</font>

39
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,630
exciting when I got on to start reading

40
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">cosmopolis also by John to leave oh yeah</font>

41
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,040
I can't tell you a word what it's about

42
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,450
because I was so distracted<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

43
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,430
language which I just hated obviously

44
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,780
I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they want authors</font>

45
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,460
include very misogynistic characters

46
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,680
they're doing it these days to create an

47
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,990
effect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you incite a specific</font>

48
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,939
reaction in the reader it was pushed too

49
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,369
far in Cosmopolis where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just got</font>

50
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,479
distracted it's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

51
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">subverting each other no one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

52
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows who knows what and it's very kind</font>

53
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,210
of confusing world in general but as a

54
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,030
whole the language<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way women were</font>

55
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,009
described just really distracted me and

56
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,600
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that probably makes me a very</font>

57
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,340
bad reader it was funny because this was

58
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,189
the first time that had just overwhelmed

59
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:51,570
me because there's no socialism

60
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,520
everywhere lots of my favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> books as</font>

61
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,439
well it's incredibly prevalent this was

62
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first time when they had really</font>

63
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">become distracted I would be really</font>

64
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,040
interested to know whether if you've

65
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,659
read a lot of John<font color="#CCCCCC"> gelinas work you</font>

66
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,729
think that's true throughout his novels

67
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:03,780
or whether you just agree with me

68
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,640
entirely and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of reactions you</font>

69
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,140
had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> cosmopolis and white noise that</font>

70
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,470
would be really interesting to hear

71
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,090
so please leave comments video responses

72
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,310
below also<font color="#CCCCCC"> read runs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as basic writings</font>

73
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,220
my religion class a Taoist text arguably

74
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,900
quite tricky to get hand log because

75
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,700
unlike the heart of understanding which

76
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">I read and talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few videos ago</font>

77
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,660
you don't finish with the sense of

78
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,460
understanding and knowing what the

79
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,680
authors trying to get at here it's all

80
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,810
about sarcasm is he joking is he being

81
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,790
serious like what's he mocking here lots

82
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,980
of chapters / continental lots of little

83
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,110
stories and examples of metaphors it's

84
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,370
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well done there and I think part</font>

85
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the nice thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about Zhang's is that you</font>

86
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,250
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out with this complete</font>

87
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,230
understanding it's a confusing read but

88
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,520
I liked it and I thought some of the

89
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,930
metaphors were really beautiful whether

90
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,320
or not he<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant them genuinely and</font>

91
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,000
literally or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also read some food</font>

all the time but need to understand it

101
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,990
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

last two records and six records of a

floating life have never been discovered

107

absolutely brilliant<font color="#E5E5E5"> very postmodern</font>

113
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,830
again funnily enough for my<font color="#E5E5E5"> post modern</font>

114
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,390
American literature class the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

115
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,040
story is basically you look into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

116
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,170
minds of Tom and Jerry so that is just

<font color="#E5E5E5">itself pushing the body to its extreme</font>

120
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,760
