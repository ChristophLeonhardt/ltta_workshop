so today I heard about the story of the anti brexit bus that was forced to divert so he didn't get struck down this narrow street in Westminster was narrowly avoiding a Ford Mondeo if you've seen it it's a massive red bus that mimics the well known red brexit bus which red we send the EU 350 million pounds a week let's fund our NHS instead the original bus was funded by vote leave which was one of the brake seat groups during the referendum campaign in 2016 the original bus hit controversy fake controversy when they left claim that the campaign had lied about the numbers the new anti brexit bus looked almost identical but this time claims that brexit is somehow going to cost 2000 million pounds a week and asks is it worth it but I think the real question is how true is the claim on the new bus are we really to trust anti brexit groups who think the sky is going to come crashing in when we leave the EU so before I get into debunking the ongoing claims from the left about the original brexit bus I want to look at this new figure that the ramona's are claiming is true so the people behind the bus claim that the numbers come from a leaked government report a spokesperson from the campaign claims that the number is reached when they consider the current UK GDP about two trillion pounds and the predicted growth to 2.7 trillion pounds by 2032 had we not voted to leave the EU so that's a predicted 35 percent increase now it's claimed that when we leave the single market which is part of leaving the EU GDP will increase by only 30% by 2032 that makes a difference in increase of 100 billion pounds which accounts for 2 billion a week first of all the bus is suggesting that this is a weekly expenditure but it's a cost that we're paying and it's not it's a predicted reduction in growth but secondly it's also based on a yet to happen trade deal post brexit we have no idea how trade deals are going to work out but given that Britain will once again be a global trading nation what's stopping us working out deals that grow our GDP more rapidly than if we'd have stayed in the you we now have a crystal ball remain this thing they do but they've been wrong time and time again but what irks me the most about this situation is that the raft still still uses the original brexit bus as a stick to beat us with they tell three big lies about this vote leave bus and we must finally put it to rest let's debunk those three big lies number one they claimed the bus lied now the ongoing battle against the vote we've claimed that the EU costs us three hundred and fifty million quid a week is tiring because there's really no controversy there at all the European Union does cost three hundred and fifty million pounds a week that was our gross contribution to the EU budget sure some of that money came back in the form of a rebate but then were bound by European Union laws and regulations that told us how to spend our money we spent three hundred and fifty million tonnes a week that left our budget and went to them therefore the European Union cost us three hundred and fifty million a week number two they said that we promised the NHS three hundred and fifty million a week now just reading the size of the original brexit bus showed that when the left claim that vote leave promised to spend three hundred and fifty million a week on the NHS they're lying through the teeth it literally says on the bus let's fund our NHS instead first of all that's a suggestion it's not a promise vote leave is not a government body vote leave has no direct influence over government policy and they are therefore unable to promise anything to the NHS like well in 350 million quid a week and furthermore when the bus says let's fund our NHS instead it's not committing or even suggesting any figure it's simply saying let's fund our NHS instead number three they blamed it on Nigel Faraj do you remember when good morning Britain sat Nigel fries down and gave him a good talking to and a good roasting for the 350 million claim I've got my issues with Faraj but I don't know how he was able to keep his calm when Suzanne read and Piers Morgan smugly asked him can you garan t-that's going to the NHS and nobody deserves to be blamed for something they categorically have no responsibility for I mean come on Nigel Faraj is not the Prime Minister and not only that Nigel Faraj never made the claim Faraj wasn't even part of vote leave he was a supporter of grassroots out so when they asked him can you can you promise that money's going to the NHS then no of course he's not he's not the Prime Minister and he'd never make the claim anyway and that's that the original vote leave brexit bus made factual claims about real life cost the anti brexit bus made dubious predictions and nothing else the original brexit boss was never a promise to spend any certain amount of money on the NHS and Nigel Faraj had nothing to do with it don't let the left get away with telling blatant lies when you hear them smugly comment on the 350 million claim and blame people who aren't in government for never fulfilling that alleged promise call them out on it the facts are on our side here and assuming that Theresa May pulls our finger out regs it will be a success you
