1
00:00:00,378 --> 00:00:01,412
NORMALIZE THEIR RELATIONS AND

2
00:00:01,412 --> 00:00:03,481
HAVE THE AMBASSADORS BACK AND

3
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:04,582
FORTH TO OPEN UP DIPLOMATIC

4
00:00:04,582 --> 00:00:06,484
RELATIONS.

5
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:07,952
MANY MEETINGS AHEAD.

6
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:10,521
>> Sean: HERE WITH REACTION,

7
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:14,258
FORMER ASSISTANT TO THE

8
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:14,959
PRESIDENT, DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA

9
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:17,662
AND RETIRED SEAT BY A SENIOR

10
00:00:17,662 --> 00:00:18,363
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, DANIEL

11
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:18,730
HOFFMAN.

12
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,664
I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT BOTH

13
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:21,866
OF THEM WILL BE WITH THIS

14
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:22,767
PROGRAM IN SINGAPORE.

15
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,736
SARAH CARTER WILL BE THERE AS

16
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:28,940
WELL, AS OF COURSE THE IG

17
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,941
REPORT, TWO DAYS AFTER THE

18
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:30,942
SINGAPORE SUMMIT.

19
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:32,343
LOTS OF GROUND TO COVER TONIGHT.

20
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:34,612
LET'S START WITH YOU DANIEL

21
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:35,380
HOFFMAN.

22
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,681
THE PRESIDENT SHOWING STRENGTH,

23
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:38,549
I WILL WALK AWAY ANY TIME.

24
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:40,818
IT'S RIGHT OUT OF THE ART OF THE

25
00:00:40,818 --> 00:00:42,186
DEAL, IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

26
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:44,022
I BELIEVE I KNOW HIM WELL ENOUGH

27
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:47,892
TO KNOW THAT HE WOULD ABSOLUTELY

28
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:49,460
WALK AWAY IN FOUR SECONDS.

29
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,696
>> I THINK HE IS ALSO DOING THE

30
00:00:51,696 --> 00:00:53,164
RIGHT THING BY MANAGING

31
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:54,532
EXPECTATIONS, HE'S DEALING WITH

32
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:55,366
DECADES OF FAILED POLICY, FROM

33
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:57,168
WHICH WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT.

34
00:00:57,168 --> 00:00:58,903
WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE

35
00:00:58,903 --> 00:01:00,405
SUNSHINE POLICY WHICH WAS MORE

36
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:02,440
LIKE THE MOONSHINE POLICY FOR

37
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,808
NORTH KOREA AT THE END OF THAT

38
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:06,844
10-YEAR PERIOD, WHEN THEY HAD

39
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:07,412
TAKEN $3 BILLION FROM

40
00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:09,080
SOUTH KOREA AND ALMOST

41
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,682
$2 BILLION FROM CHINA, INCREASED

42
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:12,684
OF THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM

43
00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:13,351
SIGNIFICANTLY, AND WE HADN'T

44
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,953
BEEN A COLORIZED OR TAKEN MANY

45
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:17,388
STEPS TO DO NEWCO RISE THE

46
00:01:17,388 --> 00:01:17,755
PENINSULA.

47
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:19,323
THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN ON BOARD

48
00:01:19,323 --> 00:01:20,024
ALL OF THOSE LESSONS LEARNED

49
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:21,826
FROM THE PAST AND I THINK HE IS

50
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:23,127
REALLY WELL PREPARED TO GO

51
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:24,328
FORWARD WITH A REALLY BOLD

52
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:26,097
STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THIS

53
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:27,765
CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE.

54
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:29,133
I THINK THE CHALLENGE WILL BE

55
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:31,402
DEALING WITH SOME OF THE OTHER

56
00:01:31,402 --> 00:01:32,537
COUNTRIES FROM THE SIX PARTY

57
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:34,539
TALKS LIKE RUSSIA AND CHINA WHO

58
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:36,541
ARE MEDDLING, AND NOT ALWAYS

59
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,911
HELPFUL ON THE PART OF RUSSIA TO

60
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:40,778
SOLVING THE CRISIS.

61
00:01:40,778 --> 00:01:41,612
>> Sean: YOU KNOW SOMETHING

62
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:43,347
COME UP THE WORLD WOULD BE A LOT

63
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:45,550
BETTER OFF IF WE DIDN'T HAVE

64
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,218
KIM JONG UN AND THE KOREAN

65
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:47,852
PENINSULA THREATENED BY

66
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:49,620
NORTH KOREA.

67
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,123
AND ENDING THE KOREAN WAR,

68
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:53,424
DR. GORKA SEEMS TO ME TO BE A

69
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:54,659
PRETTY GOOD IDEA AND WOULD BE

70
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,527
GOOD FOR THE WORLD.

71
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:59,363
WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT

72
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:00,865
KIM JONG UN WILL TALK ABOUT

73
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:03,367
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF HIS

74
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:03,701
REGIME.

75
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,036
GOOD FOR THE WORLD.

76
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:08,139
>> AFTER 65 YEARS, ABSOLUTELY.

77
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,543
JUST THE ABSURDITY THAT THIS WAR

78
00:02:12,543 --> 00:02:13,911
IS STILL REALLY, ACCORDING TO

79
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:16,581
THE LACK OF A PEACE TREATY, IN

80
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:17,315
EFFECT.

81
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:19,317
IT'S JUST A CEASE-FIRE.

82
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:21,552
SO, YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

83
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:23,721
LET'S GO THERE, BUT STAY NUCLEAR

84
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:24,222
AS THE PENINSULA.

85
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:28,559
THIS ISN'T A DICTATORSHIP THAT

86
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:29,961
WILL FALL TOMORROW.

87
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:31,863
IT WON'T SOLVE ALL OF THE

88
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:32,997
PENINSULA'S PROBLEMS, BUT IF

89
00:02:32,997 --> 00:02:34,899
ANYONE CAN END THE WAR OR DO YOU

90
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,201
NEED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.

91
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:38,202
>> Sean: AGREED.

92
00:02:38,202 --> 00:02:39,337
IT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU THAT A

93
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:42,039
REPORTER'S NOTES AND SOURCES AND

94
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,143
EVERYTHING DOJ HAS OBTAINED,

95
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:46,244
DR. GORKA, INSTINCTIVELY THIS

96
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:47,445
SOUNDS REALLY BAD TO ME.

97
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:49,647
>> I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE

98
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:51,349
PRESIDENT IS A REPUBLICAN OR

99
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:53,184
DEMOCRAT OR WHO THE REPORTER

100
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:53,551
WORKS FOR.

101
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:54,552
THAT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION BEING

102
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:56,320
DEMANDED OR CAPTURED FROM THE

103
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,956
DOJ COME ON WHAT BASIS?

104
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:00,758
>> Sean: AND AT THE BAR IS

105
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:02,160
VERY HIGH, AS WE KNOW.

106
00:03:02,160 --> 00:00:00,000
ALL RIGHT, I WILL GET TO BE WITH
