don't Trump has the highest staff turnover in the history of the American presidency but as the saying goes you know this man we all know it by now one thing that is new tonight though is signs that instead of formally replacing some of these top advisors who keep leaving Trump's just relying on new people without ever actually hiring them this report that Trump doesn't just rely on Sean Hannity's show for input but every single night after it goes off the air the two talked by phone right before bed New York magazine reporting they also speak several times a day and here's the kicker it says Trump's basically replace former White House advisors Steve Bannon with Hannity he just doesn't have a desk yet Trump and Hannity also hit the same policy points in public your communities are being hurt because of illegal immigrants crimes and drugs that are coming across the border we will get the criminals out the drug lords the gang members we're getting them out Obamacare was one of the biggest broken promises in the history of politics Obamacare itself is a single fundamental massive big government failure when it comes to recognizing the violence that took place and both sides were involved in the fighting I think this blame on both side for people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our National Anthem I think is disgraceful Americans don't want to see the flag and the national anthem disrespected I'm joined by Eric BOE Hart a senior writer at Shara blue media who has long-running beef with Fox News let's just disclose that as well as the New York Daily News mike lupica Mike what do you see here i I just read Olivia Newsies piece in New York Magazine about the bromance so you're reading the articles we interview you about and and and and you read them before you come on the show and to quote and to quote your man t-pain we are chopped and screwed if yeah that's right that's what I'm talking about no no no but but if the Vice President Hannity has this much influence with the president we're in worse trouble than I thought but don't you don't you the idea of them kind of chopping it up at night like a couple of high school sophomores and do my hair look good you know how'd you like my closing comments tonight and how do you like what I said about immigrants today destiny brought these guys together destiny brought them together it was inevitable that they would be in each other's orbits to the extent that they are now well because the line such as ever existed air between the conservative political structure and the corporate FoxNews structure has completely dissolved right the question is whether this means that they're more focused on content than substance reading from the report which by the way know if you heard this Mike read this article the show it says White House staffer and we're about the calls because the president will enter the room and say I just turned up with handy well refer to what had he said or ringing Haley up from his desk wall White House staffers still in the room right a president's are normally surrounded by experts in their field right we've previous reporting we know he's called Hannity about the nuclear arms deal about the Nunez memo about national security presidents usually don't turn to a.m. Park shows to get all of their national security do you think these guys are talking on secure lines right there spilling secrets right outside to the lines should be secure but I mean you know there's there's no protection here I mean Hannity is just going off you know non-stop with him let me push you because you were you are what is known in the biz as a Hannity hater yes okay what if this is just the fact that you don't light up this particularly what if it was I just wanna I'm gonna pick a name pick a name people get upset whoever you pick but what if it was a taunt a hissy coats a respected member of the media a writer and author and talking all the time doing this or any president would that be so bad can you pinpoint for viewers whether they agree with you or not that Sean Hannity has problems why this is bad it's bad look JFK's to talk to Washington Post columnist off-the-record New York Times columnist it was kind of a source of information you bounce things off them talking to Sean Hannity is entirely different pushing the seth rich conspiracy theory since Trump you know after Trump was elected this is that awful story about the young DC staffer who was murdered Fox News dragged this poor kid through the mud his family is suing Fox News it was so disgusting we had Sean Hannity we had one of the lawyers involved met all the time what you're saying is he doesn't know any snot that you disagree with his ideology it's that he is an unreliable Liars a logical liar an awful person I think Republican presidents in the past have have talked to conservative columnist the way JFK might have I don't think it's a great idea if you're in the media to be talking to a president regularly we're talking multiple times attacks the multiple times or I'm just pushing this reporters try to get access all time let me show a little bit for for your analysis the other piece is and this is funny because Donald Trump is the president now right but he seems to want to almost suck up to handy like he thinks it's cool they talk so much take a look I just did Sean Hannity with the one on Monday was Sean Hannity I then spoke to Sean Hannity which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity tonight it's Hannity who's a really nice guy and now we have Sean Hannity wait Sean come on Sean you have to watch Sean Hannity actually was Sean Hannity last night and Hannity Segretti he's a friendly guy it's a different kind of preamble to a different kind of Constitution we the people of Fox News to form a more perfect union the perfect union turns out to be the President of the United States and and Sean Hannity telling each other what they want to hear I was thinking about this today what if you only got your news from Fox News what if your vision of this country where it is right now was was a constant loop of what you're told specially at night by the but by the pundits and I and I use that word at night you mean right before bed yeah right before he gets on the phone and and they talk they talk about their day and and because you'd think they'd be doing that with their wives but apparently this is a different level of romance and again you know Asians are supposed to be seeking counsel serious counsel he's gotten rid of McMaster he's gotten rid of Rex Tillerson he's gotten rid of people who aren't essentially sycophants and that's not good enough he still needs to reach out to a cable TV host an AM talk-show host to get and it's just this it's just this bubble it's just a regurgitation you were great I was great molars awful what are we gonna do he's looking for a shoulder to whine on every day several times a day this is crazy yeah and and you know in that piece of the New York beat suggests you know Hannity is the leader of the kitchen cabinet I mean who else is in that cabinet Alex Jones I mean where are we going with this it's a complete humiliation for the Republican Party to stand by and watch this happen to their administration but they sped past humiliation a long time as you say I think the more fundamental thing is not about ideology but whether if as alleged these are actual top advisors yeah and they're not trained and they're not answerable not accountable the American public and yet this is American lives on the line American treasure on the line hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out
