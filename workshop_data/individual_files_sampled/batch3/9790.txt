â™ª WHAT ABOUT NORTH KOREA? WELL, I CONSIDER IT SO FAR A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT. WHEN YOU SAY SO FAR. IT'S ALWAYS SO FAR UNTIL EVERYTHING IS DONE. DEALS ARE DEALS, OKAY? I WANT TO READ YOU HIS RESUME, OKAY? HE PRESIDES OVER A CRUEL KINGDOM OF REPRESSION, GOOL LOGS, STARVATION. REPORTS HE HAD HIS HALF-BROTHER EXECUTED. SLAVE LABOR, PUBLIC EXECUTIONS THIS IS A GUY YOU LOVE. WHY DO YOU LOVE THAT GUY. LOOK, LOOK. I LIKE HIM. I GET ALONG WITH HIM, OKAY? YOU LOVE HIM. OKAY. JUST LIKE. IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH. IT'S LIKE AN EMBRACE. LET IT BE AN EMBRACE. YEAH, BUT HE IS A BAD GUY. AINSLEY: BRING IN KELLYANNE, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THIS INTERVIEW. IT WAS FANTASTIC INTERVIEW. I CALL THIS ENTIRE MEDIA BARRAGE BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP IN FULL. IT'S PART OF WHY HE GOT ELECTED. YOU CAN TRACK HIS INTERVIEW THIS WEEKEND TO THE WOMAN WHO HE BEAT INTERVIEWED THIS WEEKEND. YOU ARE REMINDED YET AGAIN REASON 3642 WHY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANTED HIM. A DIFFERENT TYPE OF LEADERSHIP. HE DOESN'T BACK DOWN. HE WAS VERY RESPECTFUL IN THE 60 MEMBERSHIPS INTERVIEW. SHARED A GREAT DEAL OF SYMPATHY FOR THE SAUDI JOURNALIST AND PROMISED TO TAKE DRASTIC ACTION IF IN FACT WHAT IS ALLEGED TO HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM DID HAPPEN TO HIM. AT THE SAME TIME HE MADE CLEAR HE DOESN'T MAKE PLEDGES TO THE PRESS, HE MAKES PLEDGES TO THE PEOPLE. ONE OF THOSE PLEDGES WAS TO COME HERE AND COME HERE IND COME HERE IMPROVE THE ECONOMY. 4.2 MILLION JOBS CREATED ALL THIS DEREGULATION. WHEN IT COMES TO QUESTIONS ABOUT KIM I LOVE THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENT DON'T FORGET THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP HAS BROUGHT THREE AMERICANS HOME FROM NORTH KOREA. SECRETARY POMPEO WAS THERE LAST WEEKEND NEGOTIATING FURTHER STEPS TOWARDS THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. THAT HELPS EVERYONE. AND WITH PASTOR BRUNSON'S RETURN THIS WEEK, THAT BRINGS THE TOTAL TO 20. 20 PEOPLE RELEASED BY FOREIGN POWERS UNDER THIS PRESIDENTS WANTS WATCH. THAT'S CALLED 4REU7 AND THAT'S CALLED CAUSATION NOT COINCIDENCE. FOR HIM LIKELY TO BE OVER THERE INCLUDING THE THREE AMERICANS WHO CAME BACK HOME TO AMERICAN SOIL WITH THEIR FAMILIES. THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP. STEVE: LESLIE STALL WAS TYING TO DO A REGULAR "60 MINUTES" INTERVIEW. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE RAW HIT BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T POSTED IT ONLINE. DOES HE FEEL LIKE IT WAS A GOOD INTERVIEW AND DOES HE FEEL LIKE IT WAS FAIRLY HE HAD EDD EDITHED? HE KNOWS IT WAS INTERVIEW HE GOT TO TALK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITHOUT THE MIDDLE MANUAL THE WAY HE DOES ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND THE WAY HE DOES IN PRINT AND TV INTERVIEWS. THE POOL SPRAYS OBVIOUSLY OUT ON THE SOUTH LAWN. THE RALLIES, 3 OR 4 OR 5 RALLIES A WEEK NOW. THIS IS THE MOST TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTABLE PRESIDENT PERHAPS WE HAVE EVER SEEN. DEFINITELY IN MODERN TIMES. HE DOESN'T FEAR THE MEDIA, HE USES THE MEDIA AS A PLAT FORM, MANY PLATFORMS BY WHICH TO COMMUNICATE HIS. THE QUESTION IS NOT SURPRISED BY ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS. HE LOVES RECEIVED HE THOUGHT AFTER HE GOT ELECTED THE PRESS WOULD BECOME MORE FAIR TRY TO DIAL IT BACK AND COVER SOME OF THE GRACE SUCCESS. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS HAD TO WORK HARDER AND SMARTER IF YOU WILL TO MAKE SURE THAT AMERICANS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING, EVEN IF THEY DON'T HEAR ENOUGH OF IT I HAVE LONG SAID BIASED COVERAGE IS ONE THING BUT INCOMPLETE COVERAGE MEANS THAT OUR VETERANS AREN'T HEARING ALL THE GOOD THAT'S HAPPENING. WHEN IVANKA TRUMP AND THE PRESIDENT DID LAST WEEK WITH RESPECT TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING THAT WILL SAVE GIRLS AND BOYS' LICE. PEOPLE WILL BE BETTER OFF. SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. THE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST LADY ARE HEADED TO GEORGIA AND FLORIDA TODAY TO SURVEY THE HURRICANE DAMAGE FROM HIKE CALL, THE DEVASTATION IS STILL THERE. THIS PRESIDENT CERTAINLY PUTS ALL THOSE FOLKS AND GRIEF HAD HIS PRAYERS. AND MAKES SURE THAT THE WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH BEGINS WITH FEMA BUT DOESN'T END THERE. HE AND THE FIRST LADY WILL JOIN IN THAT CAUSE TO SPEND THE DAY THERE TO SEE HOW WE CAN HELP. BRIAN: IN YOUR PREFFOUS LIFE LET ME ASK THAT PART OF YOUR EXPERTISE NOW AND BRING IT TO ABC POLL. THE QUESTION WAS WOULD YOU LEAN TOWARDS A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN FOR YOUR CANDIDATE IN YOUR DISTRICT 53% DEMOCRAT. 42 PERCENT SAID REPUBLICAN. FOR THE MIDTERMS. GO INSIDE THOSE NUMBERS FOR ME. WELL, OTHER POLLS HAVE SHOWED A MUCH TIGHTER APPELLATE. DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT RELIGION STRITION IN MANY PLACES. CANDIDATE AND CAMPAIGNS MATTER AS 2016. SAY YOU ARE LEANING TOWARDS A CANDIDATE. BRINGING PEACE AND PROSPERITY REPUBLICAN SENATOR WHO SAW THROUGH THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HEARING AROUND PART PART LEAR RESPONSIBLE OF BUTTING 36. ONE IN SEARCH ARE A TRUMP APPOINTEE AND CERTAINLY TWO ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT JUSTICE AND KAVANAUGH. YOU MAY BE REWARDING THAT QUESTIONS LIKE THIS AREN'T BIASED BUT THEY ARE JUICELESS. THEY ARE JUST IN A VACUUM. THIS PRESIDENT IS OUT THERE DOING ALL HE CAN AS IS THE VICE PRESIDENT AND OTHERS FOR THE 2018 ELECTIONS. HE WILL DO WHAT HE DID IN 2016, RUN THROUGH THE TAME AND LEAVE IT ALL THROUGH THE FIELD. HE HAS BEEN OUT THERE CAMPAIGNING FOR THE CANDIDATES. YOU HAVE HAD A SEGMENT IFERLIER I WAS WATCHING WHERE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 2020 ELECTIONS. THIS PRESIDENT IS TALKING BUSK 20178. OF I KNOW A OF PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR THIS PRESIDENT THE FAITH BASED COMMUNITY IN ONE WEEK THE CONFIRMATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH AND FREEDOM OF ANDREW BRUNSON LOCKED UP ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO. HE HAS HILLS HAND ON THE PRESIDENT AND IS HE PRAYING FOR OUR COUNTRY. LISTEN TO THIS. AINSLEY: CAN WE HEAR THE PRAYER AND WE WILL GET A COMMENT FROM YOU KELLYANNE? PLEASE, PLEASE. AINSLEY: DO WE HAVE THAT PRAYER? STEVE: WE DON'T. IT WAS VERY MOVING. AINSLEY: CAN I READ WHAT HE SAID BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS POWERFUL. LORD, GOD, I ASK THAT YOU POUR OUT YOUR HOLY SPIRIT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP GIVE HIM SUPERNATURAL WISDOM TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THE PLANS HAVE YOU FOR THIS COUNTRY. I FELT THE HUMILITY AND HUMANITY AND THE LACK OF BITTERNESS OF THE PASTOR. AND, OF COURSE, HIS DEEP APPRECIATION. WE ARE A GRATEFUL NATION AT THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, ALONG WITH THOSE IN CONGRESS AND CERTAINLY SOME IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND AS YOU SAY, AINSLEY, MANY OF THE FAITH LEADERS WHO NEVER GAVE UP AND NEVER GAVE IN AND KNEW THAT IT WOULD JUST BE A MATTER OF TIME. I THINK THE PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE OF PASS TORE BRUNSON AND OF THIS PRESIDENT PAID DINGEDZ HERE AGAIN. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN UNAPOLOGETICALLY SOMEBODY WHO HAS MADE GOOD ON HIS COMINT TO PEOPLE OF FAITH. TO PRO-LIFERS. TO THOSE WHO WANT A JUDICIARY QUAWFERLT MEN AND WILLIAM TO AGAIN PICK A OR PERSONAL PREDILECTIONS OR PARTY SAN PRESSURE. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF ATTENDING A FAITH DINNER WITH THE IT THE AND FIRST LED. RELIGION TWO MONTH AGO AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS IS A PRESIDENT TO ENJOYS BEING IN THE PRESENCE OF SO MANY LEADERS TELLING HIM WHAT THEY ARE HEARING AMONG THEIR CONGREGATION AND HE IS TELLING THEM ALL THE GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND LET'S BE FAIR, ALSO, TO PEOPLE OF FAITH. YES, THEY CARE ABOUT LIFE. THEY ALSO CARE ABOUT ISRAEL. THEY CARE ABOUT PEACE AND PROSPERITY. THEY CARE ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION. THEY CERTAINLY WANT OUR ECONOMY TO BE STRONG BECAUSE WITH ECONOMIC SECURITY, NATIONAL SECURITY AND VISA
