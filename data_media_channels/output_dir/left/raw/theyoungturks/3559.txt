1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,400
WE
ARE ABOUT TO DO A GREAT STORY ON

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,940
LARRY FLYNT, BUT WE MADE THAT
GRAPHIC ANYWAY.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,940
THAT IS LARRY

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,610
FLYNT IN THERE AND I HATE TO
COMPARE HIM TO DOG THE BOUNTY

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,519
HUNTER BUT HE'S PUT A BOUNTY ON
INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:13,969
AND THAT I LOVE.

7
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:16,210
HE'S AN
AMERICAN HERO, HE OFFERS FREEDOM

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,070
OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF THE
PRESS AND HE HAS DONE SOME GREAT

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,820
SERVICE BEFORE IN GOING AFTER
HYPOCRITICAL POLITICIANS.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,350
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THAT IN A
SECOND.

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,810
NOW HE IS GOING AFTER
DONALD

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:27,810
TRUMP.

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,910
SO HE HAS PUT OUT A $10
MILLION BOUNTY FOR INFORMATION

14
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,750
LEADING TO THE IMPEACHMENT AND
REMOVAL FROM OFFICE OF DONALD

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,590
TRUMP.

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:48,390
SO HE PUT OUT A TIP LINE
BOTH ON THE PHONE AND ONLINE.

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,851
IF YOU KNOW ANY INFORMATION THAT
COULD LEAD TO THE IMPEACHMENT OF

18
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,740
DONALD TRUMP AND HE IS LIKELY,
HIS BILLIONAIRE FRIENDS PROBABLY

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,880
WON'T DO IT.

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,500
BY THE WAY, THIS IS
THE EMAIL.

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,790
HE SAID HIS

22
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,680
BILLIONAIRE CRONY CAPITALIST
FRIENDS PROBABLY WON'T BUT

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,930
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMEBODY IN
TRUMP UNIVERSITY WHO COULD USE

24
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,930
$10

25
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,710
MILLION AND THEY HAVE NO
PRINCIPLES OR CONSCIOUS ANYWAY.

26
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,580
THEY WENT AND CIRCLED THEIR
WAGONS AROUND DONALD TRUMP.

27
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:23,060
THOSE ARE NOT PEOPLE WITH A DEEP
DEGREE 

28
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,140
OF PRINCIPLE.

29
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,780
THEY ARE

30
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:36,030
IN IT FOR THE MONEY AND IN FACT,
FLYNT SAYS:

31
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,320
HE IS NOT KIDDING.

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,680
HE IS A MAN
OF HIS WORD SO IF YOU ARE ONE OF

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,690
THOSE MORALISTS WHO SAY HUSTLER
MAGAZINE, THAT HAS DIRTY

34
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,610
PICTURES OF PEOPLE DOING REALLY
FUN THINGS.

35
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,170
OKAY, THEN GO AWAY.

36
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,759
ENJOY YOUR MORALISM AND JUDGMENT
OF OTHER PEOPLE IN

37
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,140
A CORNER.

38
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,710
BUT LARRY FLYNT IS
NOT HAVING ANY OF THAT.

39
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,710
HE IS

40
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,660
ACTUALLY PUTTING HIS MONEY WHERE
HIS MOUTH IS, SAYING THIS GUY'S

41
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,660
A

42
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,130
DANGER TO THE WORLD AND I'M
GOING TO DO MY BEST TO GET HIM

43
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,130
OUT.

44
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,770
HE HAS DONE THIS BEFORE
AND IT HAS WORKED BEFORE.

45
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,770
FIRST
HE

46
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,500
OFFERED A MILLION-DOLLAR BOUNTY
ABOUT MITT ROMNEY'S UNRELEASED

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,670
TAX RETURNS AT THE TIME OR ANY
DETAILS ON HIS OFF SHORE ASSETS

48
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,440
OR BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS.

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,400
AS IT
TURNED OUT, ROMNEY WOUND UP

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,770
RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS UNLIKE
DONALD TRUMP.

51
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,770
I DON'T KNOW IF

52
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,900
IT WAS PARTLY DUE TO THE
PRESSURE LARRY FLYNT PUT ON BUT

53
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,770
THERE'S ANOTHER INSTANCE WHERE
HE ABSOLUTELY DELIVERED.

54
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,770
HE PUT
ON

55
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:41,870
A $1 MILLION BOUNTY BACK IN THE
LATE 1990S SAYING:

56
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,989
HE DID THAT BECAUSE HE WAS
DISGUSTED WITH THE HYPOCRISY OF

57
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:50,350
THE REPUBLICANS WHO WERE GOING
AFTER BILL CLINTON AT THE TIME

58
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,831
FOR IMPEACHMENT BASED ON SEX
CHARGES AND HE SAID LOOK, HE

59
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:56,140
LIED ABOUT SEX.

60
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,890
EVERYBODY DOES,
ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE MARRIED.

61
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,930
AND YOU COULD AGREE OR DISAGREE
WITH HIM BUT HE SAID, THESE

62
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,350
MORAL HYPOCRITES THAT ARE
PROSECUTING HIM AND PRETENDING

63
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,920
TO BE FOR FAMILY VALUES, HE SAID
I CAN'T WAIT TO BUST THEM AND HE

64
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,390
DID.

65
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,819
NEWT GINGRICH ,WHO BY THE
WAY WAS ALSO HAVING AN AFFAIR

66
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:16,130
THE SAME TIME AS HE WAS TRYING
TO PROSECUTE BILL CLINTON, WAS

67
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,370
STEPPING DOWN SO THE NEXT
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WAS GOING

68
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,730
TO BE BOB LIVINGSTON, A
REPUBLICAN FROM LOUISIANA AND

69
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,550
LARRY FLYNT GOT HIM.

70
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,840
HE GOT
INFORMATION ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS

71
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,810
AND HE WAS GOING TO PUBLISH IT.

72
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,010
ROB LIVINGSTON PREEMPTED IT BY

73
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,770
IMMEDIATELY RESIGNING.

74
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,250
BOB
LIVINGSTON AND NEWT GINGRICH

75
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,540
WERE HYPOCRITES.

76
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,150
LIVINGSTON
AT LEAST HAD THE DECENCY TO

77
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,830
CRAWL INTO A CAVE AND NOT BOTHER
US ANYMORE.

78
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,690
HIS WIFE EVENTUALLY

79
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,810
BEGGED LARRY FLYNT NOT TO PUT UP
ACTUAL INFORMATION AND HE DID

80
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,170
NOT PUT OUT THE CD DETAILS
BECAUSE HE IS A DECENT GUY.

81
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,170
THE

82
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,450
WHOLE POINT WAS TO BE THERE' AND
IT WAS MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

83
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,450
HE

84
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,540
DID PAY THE AMOUNT.

85
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,820
SO WHEN HE
SAYS HE IS GOING TO PAY $10

86
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,480
MILLION, IF HISTORY IS ANY
GUIDE, HE WILL BUT IT HAS TO BE

87
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,540
REAL INFORMATION AND IT HAS TO
LEAD TO DONALD TRUMP'S

88
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:14,091
IMPEACHMENT AND I HOPE TO GOD HE
IS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE AS I HAVE

89
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:18,029
SAID 1000 TIMES ON THE SHOW,
DONALD TRUMP IS A DANGER TO THE

90
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,209
REPUBLIC, TO THE CONSTITUTION,
TO THE COUNTRY, INTO THE WORLD

91
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,090
WHETHER IT'S THE 25TH AMENDMENT
IMPEACHMENT OR CHARGES BASED ON

92
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,650
HIS DEALINGS WITH RUSSIA, I'M
HAPPY TO GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE

93
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,060
IMMEDIATELY.

94
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,099
LARRY FLYNT
IRONICALLY, ONCE AGAIN, DOING

95
00:04:34,099 --> 00:00:00,000
GOD'S WORK.
