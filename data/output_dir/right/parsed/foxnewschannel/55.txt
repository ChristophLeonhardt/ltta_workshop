>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU AS WELL.
THE CARAVAN AND ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION IN GENERAL
YESTERDAY FORMING THE
CENTERPIECE OF THE PRESIDENT'S
RALLY FOR NOW TEXAS TED AS
OPPOSED TO LYING TED IN HOUSTON
LAST NIGHT.
STATISTICS FROM BORDER PATROL
ILLEGAL CROSSINGS ARE UP 30% IN
FISCAL YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO
FISCAL YEAR 2017.
THE PRESIDENT LAYING THE BLAME
FOR THAT INCREASE AND BLAME FOR
THE CARAVAN AT THE FOOT OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR
STONEWALLING HIS EFFORTS TO
REFORM IMMIGRATION LAWS.
THE PRESIDENT HAS FOUND
PARTICULARLY IN COMPETITIVE
SOUTHERN STATES THE CARAVAN IS
AN ISSUE THAT REALLY ENERGIZES
VOTERS.
LISTEN HERE.
>> President Trump: YOU KNOW
HOW THE CARAVAN STARTED?
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AND NOW
THEY ARE SAYING I THINK WE MADE
A BIG MISTAKE.
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SEEING HOW
BAD IT IS.
HOW PATHETIC IT IS.
HOW BAD OUR LAWS ARE.
THEY MADE A BIG MISTAKE.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS VOWING TO
CUT AID TO CENTRAL AMERICAN
COUNTRIES FOR LETTING ALL THE
PEOPLE IN THE CARAVAN LEAVE AND
VOWING TO PUT THE U.S. MILITARY
ON THE BORDER TO STOP THE
CARAVAN FROM CROSSING.
HE SAYS HE HAS ALERTED THE
PENTAGON.
SO FAR NO INDICATIONS THAT
MILITARY IS HEADED FOR THE
BORDER BUT THE CARAVAN IS STILL
WEEKS AWAY FROM THE UNITED
STATES AS WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE
JUST REPORTED.
THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO KEEPING AN
EYE ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
KILLING OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI.
NOT REALLY BUYING INTO WHAT THE
SAUDIS ARE SAYING.
THE CIA DIRECTOR IS IN TURKEY
NOW CONDUCTING HER OWN
INVESTIGATION TALKING TO
TURKISH OFFICIALS.
SHE WILL RETURN TO THE UNITED
STATES SOON TO BRIEF THE
PRESIDENT ON WHAT SHE FOUND BUT
BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE
PRESIDENT INDICATING THEY DON'T
LIKE WHAT THEY'VE HEARD FROM
THE SAUDIS SO FAR.
LISTEN HERE.
>> President Trump: I WILL KNOW
VERY SOON.
I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH WHAT
I'VE HEARD.
>> THE WORD FROM PRESIDENT
ERDOGAN THIS MORNING THAT THIS
BRUTAL MURDER WAS
PRE-MEDITATED, PRE-PLANNED DAYS
IN ADVANCE FLIES IN THE FACE OF
EARLIER ASSERTIONS THAT HAVE
BEEN MADE BY THE SAUDI REGIME.
IT UNDERSCORES THE
DETERMINATION OF OUR
ADMINISTRATION TO FIND OUT WHAT
HAPPENED HERE.
>> IT'S LIKELY THERE WILL HAVE
TO BE SOME SORT OF WHITE HOUSE
RESPONSE TO THE KILLING OF
JAMAL KHASHOGGI.
WHAT IT IS, THOUGH, REMAINS IN
QUESTION.
THE PRESIDENT HAS REPEATEDLY
SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO
ANYTHING THAT WOULD AFFECT THE
$100 BILLION ARMS DEAL THAT HE
SIGNED A YEAR AGO.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO AFFECT THE
GENERAL TRADE BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES AND SAUDI ARABIA.
A VERY FINE LINE THE PRESIDENT
WILL HAVE TO WALK HERE.
IF IT STAYS OUTSIDE THE ORBIT
OF THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY HE
WILL FIND IT EASIER TO PUT A
SANCTION ON SAUDI ARABIA
