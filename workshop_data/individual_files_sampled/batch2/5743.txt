thank you very much that was Rasheeda Talib at a speech held in Detroit by then presidential candidate Donald Trump joining us now the winner of Tuesday's Democratic primary race in Michigan's 13th congressional district Rasheeda Talib she is poised to become the first Muslim woman ever elected to Congress and thank you for being on this morning thank you for having me so let's start with the easy question but I have to ask it because loving the growing numbers of women stepping up and running why are you running you know like I'm really tired of being outside of the ring especially now during a time in our country I think a lot of us are going through what I really believe is a troubling time and history where we don't feel like we belong or that we feel like we're being left behind no matter your background I think a lot of us on the 13 congressional district want to be able to have equal access to thrive and that's what I ran on and that's why I felt this need to run and to really fight back for all the families that are my neighbors that are the people that you know helped raise me in the community and I'm really excited for the opportunity to to actually be able to be a voice for all of them Zana jump in Zeynep Selby has a question for Rasheeda first congratulations for winning my question for you is your women of color your of Muslim or your Muslim you are of immigrant origin your parents are immigrants and you are you just want how are you gonna speak to some of the white Americans who are scared who are scared of they're gonna be minority or scared they're of people of color of immigrants how are you going to reach out to them and make sure that they are actually on board with you and they see you as an ally absolutely you know zeinab it's has to be through action it can't just be through words and so for me my congressional district is not as predominantly african-american and white and many of them supported me primarily because of my history in the Michigan Legislature and what I stood up for and many of them are gonna have to have that direct human contact with me and the work that I'm gonna do and I mean throughout the district I'm going to create neighborhood service centers we're getting people through everyday issues is going to go hand in hand with the legislative work that I do so it has to be through actions and they're going to be able to proudly say yes she represents my values she represents what I'm about and you know so many of us want to only be able to label people oh she's a child of immigrants she's Palestinian she's Arab she's a woman but for many of them I'm a girl that grew up in Wayne County just like them and very many of them really relate to the fact of my struggles as a young mom with the public school system growing up and again in Detroit with all of the different issues with poverty and challenges that we face every single day so it's going to be through action and they're going to be able to be spoiled by me and they're gonna forget that may I may not look like them but I think me having the similar challenges and the me having their backs is what I think they're gonna remember and why they're gonna be able to continue to support me fair enough and then yet we have a president who is working on divisive politics in this country you know it's about us and them and when fear is a major role in that how are you gonna address that how you know in terms of divisive Ness in terms of fear of Muslims in terms of you know beyond action how are you addressing that sentimentally even in your own words no I mean look our country is not divided I think a lot of people really truly believe that I truly believe were disconnected so I stood up when President Trump called Mexicans rapists I stood up and said that's absolutely the most unamerican thing he could have said it's absolutely unfair I've stood up for my African American neighbors when police police brutality was is still number one issues you know black lives matter to me is something that I stand up for because as an American we all should be standing up for we are just disconnected that is the problem with our country you met that disconnection is is why you know president Trump and all the different people that are surrounding him are able to to be able to be loud and be able to continue to divide us is because we're not talking to each other and I'm hoping to be able to build a lot of that connection so that people can see just how beautiful our country is and will continue to be able to be beautiful country hey there it's Jonathan Lanier we just saw the video footage of the August 2016 Donald Trump speech which you were thrown out of walk us through that moment what were you what were you protesting what were you trying to communicate there and can any kind of through-line be drawn from that day to what happened this week with you now running for office I mean it's you should know that moment it wasn't just me it was 12 other women that were with me that day every two minutes he was asked a question this was the first time ever that the Detroit Economic Club didn't allow us to ask questions he was a candidate that wanted to run for president the United States people don't always ask me well what did you say well I asked him have you ever read the US Constitution it was important to me because he was pushing for the Muslim ban he was pushing for things that I felt like was against the core values of our country and against the essence of the US Constitution and all of us as I stood there you know I did it as a former Michigan State Representative and when a lot of the women knew I was coming they felt a sense of like okay if Rasheeda can do it I can do it and so I wanted to help elevate their voices and stand up and I'm proud of that moment because it was the most American thing I ever could have done to push back on that rhetoric he was fooling out so much of information but not really getting to the core issues that were important to me and the other women that were in that room hey hi Sam Sam Stein here I think tameka's point about women running for office the man you will likely replace representative John Conyers was ousted in part because he was accused of being a serial sexual harasser of people in his office and he denies it of course but that was the context of him leaving office so I'm not asking you to speak specifically to his case but in general how much do you think this me - movement has impacted both people like you decide to run but also voter sentiment about what type of public officials they want holding public office I think you know it's really important to know you know congressman Conyers was pretty courageous one of the things you should know about him is he voted against the Iraq war when it was unpopular too he voted against the Patriot Act one a very few at that time and he pushed back on those saying we never had to check him on his votes obviously the me2 movement was there is continued to be something that's very close to me because I'm a victim of sexual harassment I remember that moment of not really understanding what just happened it was my first job out of college I can tell you that there are people in leadership not only in Congress but in companies all across the country and different areas of the sector business film you name it that are silent and that are not speaking up and pushing back against the environment that is very toxic and unfair for women and I'm really somebody that I hope to bring a voice to and I know that for us women we wait to be needed we wait till you know I caught the bat-signal Trump was so much the bat-signal for us like women we got a push forward you know people laugh at me when I say clear out the room boys it's time for us because I truly believe I don't care if you're Republican or Democrat woman if you put us in a room to deal with and fix the problem of the gun crisis we probably do it in a few hours because we're so much more different in our lens and the things that we look at we're so much more courageous when it comes to those kinds of issues that are very personal to us and I'm really hoping that we really fill the halls of Congress with you know moms like me with people that are so much more focused because we have so much more at stake when we're not in the room and we have so much to offer you know you touch on so many points that I work Rashidah every day to express to the know your value community and I met a woman running for Congress yesterday who is stepping up for many of the same reasons and women may be reticent to step up but when we do we are so frustrated and we have we have waited so long for our moment that we're like dammit we're doing it move over Rasheeda Talib thank you you're a politician an attorney you have two sons and you are the daughter of Palestinian immigrants the eldest of 14 children you
