how do you feel when you hear about
certain American politicians say things
like we don't want any more Syrian
refugees there are threats a security
threat how do you feel when you hear
things like that

feel horrible no - would you hold a duel
dr. war was a flash see if I wanna see
it's hard for the other stems to ignore
the anti-refugee rhetoric that has been
pushed across the media in recent weeks
what were your first impressions when
you got to America
I fear let me show that I love that Rafi
and the lugar man mohammed sheikh zayed

you and I Hadi are pretty smelly
