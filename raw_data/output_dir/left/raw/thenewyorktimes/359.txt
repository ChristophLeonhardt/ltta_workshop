1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,420
As an architecture student,
I had a professor that said I

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,080
didn't have the pedigree or
ideas or skill set to sort

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,570
of work in any sort
of important context.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,130
So every no is perfect for me.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,490
I thrive off a no.

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:21,181


8
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:26,580
Off-White is sort of my resume
and mood board for an actual

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,890
idea that I have for like
the modern luxury brand.

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,710
It's almost like a laboratory.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,430
For me, it's like my teenage
years is the foundation

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,890
for everything that I've
sort of done afterward.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,040
I was like an average, sort
of, suburban kid that was

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,480
skateboarding, listening to
Nirvana, Beastie Boys, rap,

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,220
Wu-Tang.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,550
Like you say the music,
you can think of a look.

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,860
And so as I started
thinking about clothing,

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,910
I was always like drawn to
what my initial interest was,

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,129
and that was T-shirts.

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:10,390


21
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,220
For Off-White, my contribution
was I would take a young idea

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,370
of streetwear, this idea
that T-shirts and hoodies are

23
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:23,560
important, but making that in
the same factories as luxury

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,610
houses.

25
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,670
So that's why we're in Italy.

26
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,570
This is men's team working on
pre-collection next season.

27
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,150
Shoes are happening in the back.

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,000
This is the women's room.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,650
I just moved to this newer space
because the concept is growing.

30
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,300
How's it going?

31
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,220
New office, it's nice in here.

32
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,800
But I have no desk in the world.

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,270
[LAUGHS] I travel probably,
like, 320 days a year,

34
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,710
eight flights a week--

35
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,240
Chicago, Frankfurt, Milan,
London, Berlin, Stockholm,

36
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,440
Rotterdam, Amsterdam,
Vegas, and LA.

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,320
It's a lot.

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,630
I work on the street
literally, like phone in hand.

39
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,040
I feel like Off-White be one of
the truly first, sort of, like,

40
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,870
a luxury brand that's been
just built from social media.

41
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,600
It behaves in this
sort of hybrid,

42
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,990
in between a traditional system
and a new system less than

43
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,320
streetwear, that clothes just
come out at different times.

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,410
They're posted on Instagram,
and consumers can buy them.

45
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,310
And I'm interested in that
hybrid in between them both.

46
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,670
I'm directly pointed at this
generation that hasn't been

47
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,460
messaged luxury to yet.

48
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,030
As an Off-White sort of look,
I'm looking to put this with

49
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,980
like a T-shirt
and jeans perhaps.

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,550


51
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,010
This Millennial young person,
they love to covet things.

52
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,070
They're sort of waiting for
a designer that sort of faced

53
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,360
to them.

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,690
I want to make a modern
version of her wedding dress.

55
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,980
I like this.

56
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,800
I like seeing the shoulder.

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,210
I love this idea that Off-White
can go from like a study

58
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,530
graphic T-shirts all the way to
a wedding dress under this sort

59
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,440
of muse that I've
dictated for the season.

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,530
This current collection
that I'm developing,

61
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,450
choosing Princess
Diana, the muse,

62
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,870
is sort of this resonance.

63
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,140
It's super like young Diana.

64
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,910
Yeah, I couldn't be happier.

65
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,520
It looks like the sketch.

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,690
Can you walk?

67
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,200
This is always what
I wanted to do.

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,282
And no one does it, haute
couture meets street.

69
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:43,090
But people say it all the time.

70
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,800
I've had the fortunate ability
to sort of craft my own path.

71
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,830
People ask me all the time,
do you feel some sense of like

72
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,570
achievement or fulfillment?

73
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,490
And the answer's zero.

74
00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:00,060
I have no-- there's no
feedback loop that's like, yes.

75
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,270
I'm only interested in
my making new things,

76
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,670
like getting to this
place of the next idea.

77
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,790
I think bell bottoms are going
to come back because everyone

78
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,800
has in their closet skinny
jeans, boyfriend jeans.

79
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,079
I also like for women,
let's buy dickies,

80
00:04:19,079 --> 00:00:00,000
girls in dickies pants, cropped.
