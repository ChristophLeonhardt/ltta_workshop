Canadian Prime Minister and floppy haired cutie pie Justin Trudeau says his meeting with Donald Trump at g7 left him petulant to the point of being downright huffy at a press conference after their meeting Trudeau said Trump made him so surety he just wanted to stamp his foot and not in a good bhangra dance sort of way like he did in India but in a very very snappish I am not altogether pleased sort of way which may even include him tossing his hair in a very waspish manner indeed Trudeau said he had prepared for his angry press conference by repeatedly watching the scene from Love Actually in which British Prime Minister Hugh Grant tells off that nasty American president Billy Bob Thornton while all the British people looked triumphant and the music swells Trudeau said he wished he could have some music swelling in his press conference - and maybe even some Canadians looking triumphant although he didn't want to take things too far when President Trump was asked to respond to the Prime Minister's remarks Trump said he did not remember meeting with Trudeau but he had enjoyed the song love yourself and thought Justin and Haley Baldwin made an attractive couple when told that was Justin Bieber not Justin Trudeau Trump responded whatever same difference trigger warning I bet you Cleveland and this is the Andrew Klavan show all right the Cleveland's weekend is over and I am

have to take care of but now we can talk about the news I listen you hear it but my thought for the day my thought for the day is that elites are savages you know there's the scene in the tough guy mystery movie where there's a big at all the elites are gathered at their mansion and they're having a party and the women are all dressed to the nines and it's flowing gowns and the guys are in tuxedos and everybody's being sophisticated then the rumpled crumpled detective comes in and he's wearing a battered green coat and a hat smoking a cigar maybe or cigarette and he comes in and he reveals who the murderer is and finally like the mask drops so we see these elites suddenly just spewing hatred yes of course I kicked the maid to death she was just the maid what like I'm the person this is happening in front of our eyes this is our elite reacting to Donald Trump our elites are revealing that instead of being what they think they are what they want us to think they are is these elevated cultured intellectual people who are looking out for a better world they just show that they have their own interest and if you roll a bowling ball down their alley and you break apart their interest you make it harder for them to do business harder for them to make money harder for them to get respect suddenly they turn into an it's like that senior yes I heard it I killed her with my bare teeth you know I did yeah this is what they've become so we see it's at the g7 I mean look III I'll raise a a doubt but I have about Trump but in general now I think we have to start to trust the Donald I think we do you know what it he destroyed the Iran deal and we heard oh my gosh this is the worst thing ever obviously it was a good idea he pulled out of the Paris Accord now the Sun is gonna hit the earth because did God's will be angry nothing it was fine it was that was a bad bad deal he was right he's gotten that he told them they had to pay more for NATO and if those are our allies and he was like yeah why aren't they paying for nail now they're paying more for NATO he did all this stuff a week we're told that his treatment of Kim jong-un was gonna destroy the world because the nukes would fly and now they're having this conference in Singapore they're actually having a meeting so it's time like to start to think about the fact that man you know maybe he knows what he's doing at least he knows at least he knows what he doesn't want we know this so far he knows what he doesn't want he goes to the g7 and they're screaming he insulted the Europeans and he didn't didn't sign the communique you read this communique I noticed that nobody published the communique I had to hunt the communique down it's just this statement this bland statement of European socialist values it's like we're all gonna be European socialists I'm glad he didn't sign it you know they can stuff their communique like first of all why don't they go to their countries and find out why they're women than girls are being raped while they're police turn a blind eye I mean if they're not going to defend the West how do they become the representatives of the wet you know they put out this picture you have those two pictures they put out a picture of that there's Obama at the g7 yeah we're all buddies we're always got his arms around everybody and here's Trump at the g7 like facing them down as they would rather that this guy standing up for me so I trust him I'm not sure yet that he has a plan I hope he has a button but basically basically all he's saying is that we pay high tariffs on their stuff which is true and they don't pay as high as we do which I also think is true I'm not Jewish sure that's as true with Canada as it is with the EU but it is true so he talks about eight years here's basically what he was saying here's cut number seven where he sums up what his problem is with everybody I think the relationships were outstanding but because of the fact that the United States leaders of the past didn't do a good job on trade it's gonna change I mean it's not a question of I hope it changes it's gonna change a hundred percent and tariffs are going to come way down because we people cannot continue to do that we're like the piggy bank that everybody's robbing and that ends we had extremely productive discussions on the need to have fair and reciprocal meaning the same people can't charge us two hundred and seventy percent and we charge them nothing that doesn't work anymore the relationship that I've had with the people the leaders of these countries has been I would really rate it on a scale of zero to ten I would rate it at ten that doesn't mean I agree with what they're doing and they know very well that I don't so we're negotiating very hard tariffs and barriers so all right so they're in this argument and he says the relationships are good but we're having a disagreement we're in a negotiation he leaves town and Justin Bieber you know you know that it really is remember that's a movie Love Actually a Hugh Grant is the British prime minister and Billy Bob Thornton is the evil Bush because it was evil Bush who was in office then we never had these movies when Obama was in office no no no that was no it was always what a wise wonderful person he was but then we had the evil Bush and he comes in he wants I can't remember what he wanted you grant to do but Hugh Grant stands up to him and here's the triumphant scene a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend and since bullies only respond to strength now onward I will be prepared to be much stronger and the president should be prepared for them so Joe is obviously watching this again and again waits for Trump to leave because he doesn't want Trump to knock his block off right and then comes out with this kind of wimpy version of that the United States has moved forward with significant tariffs on our steel and aluminum industry particularly did not take lightly the fact that it's based on a national security reason that for Canadians who either themselves or whose parents or community members have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with American soldiers and far-off lands and conflicts from the first world war onwards that it's kind of insulting and I highlighted that it was not helping in our renegotiation of NAFTA and that it would be with regret but it would be with absolute certainty and firmness that we move forward with retaliatory measures on July 1st applying equivalent tariffs to the ones that the Americans have unjustly applied to us I have made it very clear to the president that it is not something we relish doing but it is something that we absolutely will do because Canadians were polite were reasonable but we also will not be pushed around you see a mean man white man drugs come out tweets you know what a weak guy did he was all meek and mild while he was in the room with me then he attacks me behind my back Peter Navarro goes on Fox he's the trade council guy and listen to Peter Navarro escalate this war of words and a big hurry there's a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door and that's what bad faith Justin Trudeau did with that stunt press conference that's what weak dishonest Justin Trudeau did and that comes right from Air Force One and I'll tell you this to my friends in Canada that was one of the worst political miscalculations of a Canadian leader in modern Canadian history that's probably true you just get the feeling there's just gonna be like a hole in the floor where I used to be so the New York Times is running a story this Trump is destroying the West he's destroyed he's negotiating he's negotiating with our allies who maybe got too used to thinking of us as daddy maybe they got too used to thinking of us as daddy and now we have to take care of ourselves maybe I get back to this in just a second but first we got to talk about man great man you got to say there man great because it's Father's Day is coming up and as you know when you ask your father what he wants for Father's Day he says he says whatever letter you know and then you don't give him anything he give him a tie and he's hurt right but if you give him an kraits he will be happy because it's not just the gift it's the way it comes it comes in a gigantic crate a wooden crate you can have a taped up with duct tape as Drew and then it comes with a crowbar you pry it open some of your dads are gonna want to pry it open with their teeth that's the way I like to do it just rip into it a bit to shreds but it's got great stuff like knife making kits whiskey appreciation that's the one I got to get a beautiful look the Cantor in it and some great glasses it's for the dads like finer things but like to rip open a crate before they get them get your special Father's Day discount today at man crates calm slash Clavin que la VA n that's how it's a limited time offer only for Father's Day go today - man crates dot-com slash Clavin man crates dot-com slash Clavin great gift it really is they're really fun so at this point I think it's a rational thing for us to say well it's let's Trump has got a weird style he's a little bit over the top let's see what he's doing here right what does he ruined whom is he oppressed the economy is great right peace we are crisis is gone the judge appointments are good Israel as our friend again you know what what's the problem we're not going to war with Canada you know we're in an argument with Canada that's okay what is the problem but the elites what he's disturbing is he is disturbing the system by which the elites became elites and the system that came the elites in place and that's why this Romney what on earth is happening that these people are so angry did you see the Tonys you know the Tonys of the Broadway play Awards Robert De Niro gets up at the Tonys I'm embarrassed for the guy he's a guy was a great actor in this day you know this is his speech at the Tony's and listen to the audience reaction I'm gonna say one thing Trump it's no longer down with trumpets drunk it's a rapturous standing ovation from these wealthy theater-going clowns I mean you know this is like these are the people save up to go to the theatre people save up to come over from Jersey come in from Connecticut come in from Long Island to see the theater because the tickets are so expensive they save up and and basically when you say that you're telling every single person who voted for him thinking about it maybe but he'll do some good things maybe I'll do some you're telling every single one of them the same words it's not just Trump you're saying that - its - everybody who supports him everybody who thinks he deserves respect as president the United States you know they interviewed this woman Noma duma's Winnie Foos does the Harry Potter show Harry Potter classic bridge-and-tunnel show that's what they call it that means that the suburban people like to come in the sophisticated New Yorkers are supposedly going to you know see Denzel Washington do Eugene O'Neill but the bridge-and-tunnel people are coming in to see Harry Potter listen to what she said one thing that's surprising about Harry Potter is that even though it doesn't it's not as Evert Lipa litical like something like angels in America I sort of feel like there are moments in it there are things that happen with who may not who must not be named that have real resonance today in particular in America are you aware of that do you feel that I really do believe that that's why this is resonating a lot of the moment London when it started peaceful and there was a moment when okay this is the storytelling but now two to three years later since we've opened in London to be here you go actually this story's getting deeper and deeper and deeper and we as all us human beings are all fighting to be connected but especially to be seen if you're not seen or not heard that's what dangerous stuff happens that's where people under the radio do you very cruel things and that's what this play is about and it's about bringing things into the light letting your light shine this is what Jake has always been about let the darkness out into the light and that's why I'm very proud to be here telling the story right now because as you intimated those things are very important should the president come see the Harry Potter Harry Potter in a crash trial no Thank You anybody else yeah yeah what really really first you tell us first of all that's a London accent I think so first year for a foreigner on our on our soil telling us our president can't come to your lousy show you know that's so that's supposed to draw us me but you know what would it take for them to stand up and say you know I was given a gift these people were they were given tremendous gifts they have tremendous talent my gift is to entertain and delight you my gift does not give me any great insight into who you should vote for or what decisions you should make what political decisions you should make based on your life I'm only here to entertain and delight delight you I have my opinions you have your opinions you know I'm so glad you're delighted by my play and sit on and shut up what would it take what would it take Andrew Garfield another good actor he's an Angels in America angels in America is a not bad play it has that gay people you know gay a lot of gay people in the theatre I don't get people involved in theater love gay people like to go to the theater angels America's this triumphant moment for gay people because it was this open gay play that rose out of the AIDS crisis if you watch the play it's absurd it's thesis is absurd its thesis is that Roy Cohn Joe McCarthy's secretly gay vicious lawyer was somehow somehow his not coming out was somehow responsible for the AIDS crisis as opposed to people going to bath houses and sleeping with 22 people in a single night you know that maybe that had something to do with it no it's because Roy Cohn was secretly gay and so Andrew Garfield gets up and gives this speech you know accepting this award he can't just make his thank-you speech we are all sacred and we all belong so let's just bake a cake for everyone who wants a cake to be baked so what if I said let's all be in a play about how wonderful Adolf Hitler was let's you know let's let's bake a cake saying that Trump is a great guy say make America great again you know why does he get to it yet why why if did where did they determine that they have the right to say what gets expressed what opinions are okay what opinions are going to be cancelled and censored you know what is he talking about it's because he thinks oh I'm an actor but you are just a cake baker you are that's not an art you're not I am an actor you make cakes you don't have a right to express your feelings your religious beliefs it's unbelievable they're even hoping you know John McCain and I hate to go after John McCain at this point I know he's very ill and I wish him well and I you know I'm not this is not a personal attack but he tweets to our allies right the g-seven people bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade ProGlide they're equal and supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values America and stand with you even if our president doesn't John McCain telling either Europeans that we stand with them rather than with our president I mean how how low can you go Bill Maher is wishing for a Namit collapse so we can get a Trump listen to this this economy is going pretty well we have to what you know is that funny it is going well for now for now right that's Mike thank you that's my question is like I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point and by the way I'm hoping for it because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy so please bring on the recession sorry if that hurts people but it's either roofer a recession or you lose your democracy there's a guy who doesn't know what it's like to go home and not have a job and not be able to give your kids things and not be able to pay for things you know I mean what that what is he talking about what are they all talking about what is happening in this country right now aside from the fact that Trump is obstreperous what is happening that is making them so we put together this montage because the left is always talking about civility I just want to play a montage up just these are things I picked out at random and asked the guys here to put together of the way they talk about the President of the United States I think he came off like an idiot today he is like a child I'm gonna say it very bluntly he's mentally ill racist racist racist racist a wild animal it's either he is so stupid that he done wonders no no it's possible we got Donald Trump in the first place as a punishment for not being good enough citizens Trump it's only because he is boiling the assumptions that they live by and that make them rich safe elites that make them admired that's what they're so angry about is noting that he has done they cannot cite a single thing that he has done that is endangered this democracy hey I have to talk about you know III have no sentimentality about celebrities when celebrities die I don't get choked up it doesn't you know it doesn't reach me and one of the reasons is it's not that I don't miss them it's not that I didn't admire and respect them but I know that they have family members who are actually in grief and who will be grieving past this day so I don't like to get all elaborately sentimental about it I have to tell you that I actually choked up when Charles Krauthammer sent out a letter saying that he only has weeks to live he's been the Fox News special report panel where I used to tune him in just to find out what I thought I would just tuned in what's much what's my opinion oh here's Charles Krauthammer now I'll know and he wrote this lovely stoical letter very much in keeping with his personality saying I leave this life with no regrets it was a wonderful life full and complete with the great loves and great endeavors that make it worth living I'm sad to leave but I leave with the knowledge that I lived the life that I intended you know it's funny I remember standing with my pal Crowder Steve Crowder when we were both at PJTV and we were watching him on TV and Crowder turned to me and said why does he sit so funny and I said well he's virtually a quadriplegic and Crowder didn't know and a lot of people didn't know I mean he never talked about it he never asked for pity for it he never asked people to admire him for it he wrote about it a little bit in his book of columns but he really just just went about the but it was just a tragic accident he did something that I have done is she dove into the wrong side of a pool I did that I broke mine own one of the many times I broke my nose but a little change in direction same thing could have happened it's just a tragic tragic accident he never played off it I the reason I feel so connected to the guy though I only met him once I introduced him at a function once but but the reason I feel connected to the guy is when I came back from England and I started to realize oh my gosh I've become a political conservative I started to look for voices that I could admire and respect and they didn't have to say things that I agreed with Krauthammer believed a lot of things I don't believe he was pro-abortion yeah you know he had that probably more interventionist idea of American power than I have but but that didn't matter all I cared was that they cared about freedom they cared about liberty and that they had integrity and he had integrity he had grace he didn't scream at people he didn't have to you know he didn't have to talk in a melodramatic way to make his points even and you know the one time I remember strongly disagreeing with him was when Obama and Hillary were in a primary and he said no there's no way a guy named Barack Hussein Obama is gonna be the press in the United States and I remember saying oh yes he's going to win don't you understand but the reason he thought that was because he thinks more highly of the American people than perhaps we deserve and I always thought when he got his predictions wrong it was always because he had elevated the people above what they sometimes - because sometimes they do dumb things like electing Barack Obama just a great voice who really helped me find my voice in in politics and I'm you know look it was it's a wonderful life that he made out of sheer courage and grace and skill and talent and that's a that's a beautiful beautiful thing and I'm sorry to see him go all right we got Michael Knowles coming up we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but oh but you know I should tell you before you go that you can now get us on Amazon Alexa and the Google home

we'll have Michael Mills Knowles is coming is back from Hawaii lives in what I guess wakiki celebrating his wedding and I guess trying to keep it I guess it was good to be on an island so your wife couldn't escape and you got a lei I think it's always good to get laid on your honeymoon it's very important to get laid on your honey it's really you know drew it was really something you're right I came straight from Waikiki I applied a lot of 70 SPF sunscreen and I still became transracial you are transracial I got to say you could identify as a black woman I think in that shirt I think that I do I use the honeymoon discount a lot I'd go to every you know restaurant and bar and I'd say you know I'm on my honeymoon give me free drinks or whatever so maybe if I can get more privileged points for that I'll do it but I've learned a lot about marriage you know because oh yes now you're a married man I'm a married man I've been married for nine days now and you guys were always give me advice on marriage you and Ben and the god-king you know but I finally realized something about marriage I've been married a full nine days now and I just didn't realize that what marriage is really about is people giving you a lot of presents and then having dinner in a tuxedo and then floating around on a peach that is the real meaning of marriage marriage I'm glad you found that you know I noticed I noticed that all the guys were giving you advice they were giving you this very good but very complex and deep advice and my advice was don't sleep with other women I'm like it's very good it's very good to go to a beach for your honeymoon I realize yeah because you get married your says rush of adrenaline you're so happy it's so beautiful and then you go to a place where you actually sit and you wave goodbye to every other bikini you say no more to you no more to you goodbye so you see you later thanks for the memories yeah and you say no more you're so much luckier than you deserve that because you can easily spend the next 60 years going like I don't know what how that happened the grace abounds it's it's the Michael illogical argument for the existence of God is sweet little ELISA st. ELISA knows that is an exit is the sixth argument for so you come back and it's Gay Pride Day which i think is a you know I think it is just to keep you just to remind you that they want to be married to that's right and what I'm missing - you know a reminder it is it's Gay Pride Month actually June is Gay Pride Month they get a whole month to be proud well but I think it's I think it's actually Gay Pride I think it's really Gay Pride all the time at this point because I looked I said way to say wasn't last month Gay Pride Week and Gay Pride this and I looked on Wikipedia I took a list of all of the gay pride events and there are major national gay pride events every month of the year January foodless other really there are the reason that June was selected is because of the Stonewall riots in New York a bunch of cops tried to shut down an illegal bar they didn't have a liquor license but this was it was a gay bar so it provoked all of these riots and it's credited with starting the Gay Pride movement and it's amazing to see how that movement is transformed I've always wondered why the Y pride was chosen as the emblem of the gay rights movement this bugged me too yeah it doesn't you know because when this began one of the guys who started the gay the gay pride movement he actually used the phrase gay is good and this was a play on Stokely Carmichael's black is beautiful is same time 68 I think it was gay is good and there's a there's an argument to be had there right the argument is you people say that this behavior is bad morally and I think it's good morally and here's why and I'm going to explain why it's good and why they're perfectly fair or you're totally a fair argument there is no argument that pride is good you know I have to tell you this I I I live in West Hollywood which is to gay people what the Jewelry District is Hasidic Jews okay I mean and when I say that I'm not actually joking you walk through it when you walk through parts of our drive-through nobody walks anywhere you when you drive through parts of West Hollywood virtually everyone is gay there's there's rainbow flags everywhere with the city flag and the country flag and all this so I'm driving by a church that I often go to and there are rainbow ribbons coming out and I thought like okay you know listen I I know this church and they feel that you know homosexuality is fine I had no model been joseph´s Technicolor Dreamcoat it it's but pride is one of the seven deadly sins right I mean it's not the gay it's the pride I was at and then I dropped drive past another church and they've got a big rainbow flag and says affirmation and I thought oh yeah I remember Christian affirmation except I'm not you know st. Thomas and following the lead of st. Gregory said that pride is please pardon the the queen of all sins because it's the first sin it's the sin that caused Adam to fall and mankind to fall of Satan to fall it causes Lucifer Falls that's right it is it is the it is the mack daddy of all sins yeah because it causes all of the other ones and just to celebrate pride really doesn't make a lot of sense and it leads to all of these bad things if you look because you you actually do see the spirit of pride in this modern movement there is this CrossFit employee ironically a legal researcher at CrossFit his name's Russell Berger and he came out and he said you know I don't celebrate pride I think pride is a sin I don't think CrossFit should celebrate pride or force its employees to or force its clients to okay and so what what do you think happened and one of the reasons he said that is he said the pride movement is so intolerant of other views it's really bad it has all these bad implications so the CEO of CrossFit Greg Glassman called burger zealot and said that he quote needs to take a dose of shut the F up and then he fired him really he fired him to prove him super of head taller tolerant they are you know they this is you know I feel a little bad about this because I've always been kind of Pro gay rights and feel that gay people should be left alone yeah look at my shirt yeah exactly I will that is why we let you in here with that shirt just but I these guys they they give gay people a bad name I mean this thing with the the cake in the cake baker in Colorado and people saying what do you mean he he can say that I don't want to make this cake it's unbelievable the oppression and the intolerance and the you know it's it's funny there are two ways to look at this if gay people have the right to be gay because people have the right to do what they want they have the right to do what they want but if they have the right to do what they want then certainly I have the right to disagree with them or dislike them or not celebrate them I mean it's by the logic that gives them their rights you have the rights not to you have the right not to approve them the same logic so is essentially what they were saying they pretended they were saying that they want to be free but what they were really saying is you've had the power now we want that's right and pride doesn't have a lot of logic and coming after the you know coming out of this intersectional amount of conglomeration of left away ideas it really isn't about reason it's about my I'm gonna have the power now I'm gonna force you into submission and there's a real irony here because you see the Baker you see that that florist in Washington you see this CrossFit employ you see all of this happening and the trouble with pride is people rarely know when it's affecting them you know if Adam knew that he was falling for it he probably would have still been in the garden now and Satan would still be in heaven it's very insidious and ironically now this this pride movement this intolerant pride movement has become the mainstream culture every company is doing it every company is forcing its employees basically to deal with it and its clients to deal with it and if you contradict that orthodoxy you will be ruined your livelihood will be ruined your business will be ruined your reputation will be ruined and it's this incredible inversion from the days of Stonewall you've seen the tables completely turn and it's a it's a not a pretty thing to watch it really is not and they we've lost the plot you know it's funny because you think what they're really essentially saying is that we have the right to tell you what to believe but they don't they don't ask themselves the question well who has the the state the state has the right you know your corporation has the right of these are the things you believe in do you believe that Donald Trump who is the head of our federal state do you believe he has the right to tell you what to think do you believe that the corporation's those evil corporations we always heard so much about that they have the right to tell you what to think it is an amazing thing that they want they think they can choose it on a piece by piece basis on a case by case basis but they don't realize that once they sacrifice the principle you've lost your right to free and it's it's such shallow thinking you play that Andrew Garfield clip of everyone should bake cakes and all this that when Andrew Garfield bakes me a cake frosted with Robert De Niro's tears delicious tears then I will believe he's anything other than a hypocrite but of course that that's what we're getting out of that side it really it really is true and it's sad you know because I I do believe that the majority view gay people I've ever met her natural conservatives you know they they they work hard they want to be the people I work with in the business and all that total you know they want to they just want their home life and all this and I don't want them picked on I don't want them oppressed I don't want them insulted or bullied anything like that but I do want people to be able to have you know their religious beliefs what what is so hard about that and it really does become a case of them against Christianity because they're not they haven't got the guts to go after Islam so they're going to go after Christianity where they basically say yes we love you but you shouldn't be doing this you don't see a lot of Methodists hurling gay people off of roofs in Ohio that's not something that really happens after this method yeah the Methodists methods it's very it's just it is a really shallow attack and I totally agree there is such a natural conservatism to to gate to a lot of the gay people that I know and but it's because of that it's positioned in this intersectional web of chaos and destruction I think it's being really wedged in and political gay activists and political pride activism I think has really really hurt whatever movement there could be for you know acceptance and to being nice to everybody including gay people yeah all right what are you doing to your show today so today we are talking all about boys to men I have gone from being a boy I'm now a man in some sense in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king and nobody's getting married so that qualifies me for something I have to tell you knows while you were away I actually gave I actually remembered that you existed and I was thinking about it I thought gosh I actually respect him for doing this I may change my entire opinion I know one thing so but it's really there's a lot of fodder today because you've got everything from boys like Justin Trudeau to men like a Donald Trump or Charles Krauthammer for that matter so we will cover the gamut of manliness all right good enough shirt just just to mix things up a little bit yeah I'll talk to you soon bye I know what am I gonna do with this newfound respect for Michael Moll this guy's gonna change my entire attitude towards life all right our crappy culture so speaking of really crappy things I mean here is ears a crappy thing there have been two recent celebrity suicides and as I said before I don't get sentimental about celebrities and these happen to be two celebrities I had no emotional connection to it all Kate Spade was the designer of purses mostly yeah you know and I knew her because whenever my wife would ask for a purse I knew that that was the first one I should look up because she liked her purses and all that Anthony Bourdain you have to be a food guy I wasn't a food guy but I heard I have friends who just loved him really smart friends who just thought his show was absolutely delightful and that his attitude was really delightful and so here are two people who have contributed to the culture they both of them had young children I think when the 13 year old daughter one 11 year old daughter and they killed themselves and and that tells you something I mean that you know it's not always true that what celebrities do represents the wider culture but in this case it does I mean here are two worthwhile wives all lives were potentially worthwhile here are two people who thought as suicidal people do they thought that oh people would be better off without me that's just not true of their children are gonna suffer for this with this for the rest of their lives and they're not better off without them but the point is that it represents something that is going on at least in American culture where suicides have skyrocketed 25% in the years between 1999 and 2016 and that doesn't mean that that that it's higher than it's ever been it has been as high before but it does mean that something is wrong okay if they told me that it which is also true when they say that depression has risen that's also true that may not mean anything because it may just mean oh well people are more comfortable reporting depression or that the definition of depression has changed or more people just use that word when they mean they're sad it's a very hard thing to parse whether people are actually more depressed than they used to be but it's not hard to parse with a people for killing themselves if if the rate of suicide goes up that tells you that something is going wrong now when that happens there's no shortage of people who want to tell you what's wrong with society I mean this is the thing as like a you people make their living telling you the apocalypse is coming that the environment is going down the drain that climate is gonna be destroyed and something is terribly wrong with our society the god people always say we've turned away from God the the family people always say our families are falling apart and people don't like technology we'll say the Internet is making us more isolated and you know government they've left these are always saying well we need more government programs to deal with mental health issues all of those things may be true or maybe partly true or may have something true in them okay but they're awfully big ideas when you're talking about an entire culture because the fact is you know we're in many ways we're living in a golden age I mean you sit you know I was sitting on a friend's balcony over the weekend looking out over the you know not over Beverly Hills looking out over Los Angeles and I could see a Trader Joe's like down below me you know it's thinking I can get in my car and in two minutes go buy some of the finest food available in a package bring it back up here and cook it and eat like the Pharoah never ate like pharaon never could dine the way I can dine by taking out a plastic card and spend them yeah just a couple of bucks and it's unlikely that that Trader Joe's is gonna go away leaving this in a state of famine we're living in many ways in a golden age but but I think we can say something about this and and I say this I want to say this is somebody I've written about this in my memoir the great good thing I in I've lived two lives as I said many times at least two lives up until the age of 28 I was a twisted sick depressed human being I was in terrible terrible mental state and it culminated with my seriously contemplating suicide and I was cured by a psychiatrist and it doesn't happen very much this guy was a brilliant guy I was motivated I did not want to be an unhappy person and I was cured of and became more and more joyful from that moment on my life has just been in it's annoying I mean everybody who knows me is deeply annoyed by the level of joy that I experience in life and especially since I found God that also just increased that I after that I worked for a couple of years volunteered for a couple of years on suicide hotlines and so I talked to people and I think I can say that I was an effective counsellor and here's what I want to point out so that I put that forward as my credentials to talk about this here's what I want to point out the you at the same time that our suicide rate has been climbing the use of antidepressants has also been skyrocketing it is up 65% the use of antidepressants between 1999 and 2014 now an antidepressants were really just becoming worthwhile around that time so you know that that may be overstated but still at the same time the use of antidepressants was going up the rate of suicide was going up here's what I'm not saying whenever you talk about this you have to tell people what you're not saying because people hear what they want to hear I'm not saying that these drugs are useless I'm not saying they never helped anybody I'm not saying they can't be carefully used and and bring people out of their depression help them get therapy what I am saying is they it seems to me that we have evidence that they are being vastly vastly over prescribed and when they are prescribed they are not being prescribed in tandem with the human interventions that actually are what solves depression because here is my observation having been depressed and having been cured it is love that cures you it is love that cures you you know I my psychiatrist was a brilliant man he had a lot of brilliant ideas he had great therapeutic technique but when I looked back over it over the after after I got out and I looked back on it I realized I didn't agree with a lot of his ideas it wasn't the insights I had it was my love for him as a mentor and I believe he returned that love because we were very similar kinds of people as a sympathetic soul he was the only mentor I've ever had in my life and it was that that really saved me of course the love of my wife the love of my children loved her friends I think when I was talking to people on hotlines I was acting out of love and by that I mean Christian love which is acting on our common a heritage in the heart of God that we all live in the heart of God we're all infinite worth to God if you act that out on your life you're expressing love it doesn't mean just feeling affection for somebody the the problem with these drugs is that they represent a strain of scientific thinking that we are chemistry sets that can be adjusted to taste and not spirits and that that thinking is incorrect it is simply wrong we are spiritual beings we are the people we think we are we are the Andrew and the Joe and the Michael Knowles of that person that we live with every day who has memories and dreams and hopes and desires we are that person and that person can only be reached by the love of another person when they use when they carefully use drugs when they carefully prescribed drugs in order to get you out of us a sloth so deep that you can't react to love that can be really useful but it is it's the love the love of people and the love of God that cures you that does not mean here's another thing I'm not saying that does not mean it's anybody else's responsibility when you take your life only you can decide not to take your life but it means that whether you are prescribed drugs or not it is the love of therapists of volunteers on hotlines of brothers of friends of wives and husbands it is that that's gonna save you and do not let a doctor tell you the TV just gets your prescription right it's gonna cure you that's just not true you have got to find links to other human beings to beat this thing and I really do believe we can beat it and I think that we make me to just re-examine the way we use pills all right tomorrow
