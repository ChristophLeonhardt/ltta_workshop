RALLIED TO THE DEFENSE OF

8
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:15,421
MS-13.

9
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:16,122
SADLY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE

10
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:17,457
LEARNED THE TRUTH ABOUT IT

11
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:21,628
ROD MICKENS' DAUGHTER WAS

>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME,

16
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:26,800
TUCKER.

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,400
>> Tucker: WHAT'S YOUR

18
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,068
REACTION TO THE CONTROVERSY

19
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:28,968
AROUND THE PRESIDENT'S

20
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:31,171
DESCRIPTION OF MS-13 AS

21
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:31,504
ANIMALS?

22
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:34,207
>> HE WAS ACTUALLY BEING

23
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:35,942
VERY POLITE ABOUT IT.

24
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:37,344
YOU KNOW, HE CAN'T REALLY

25
00:00:37,344 --> 00:00:38,511
SEA WHAT'S ON HIS MIND

26
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:39,679
BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE TO TAKE

27
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,747
THINGS OUT OF CONTEXT.

28
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:45,185
BUT WHAT THEY DID IS A IS

29
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:46,152
AADVANTAGE ACT AND HE NAILED

30
00:00:46,152 --> 00:00:47,821
IT ON THE HEAD BY CALLING

31
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,289
THEM ANIMALS.

32
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:49,956
>> Tucker: WHY DO YOU THINK

33
00:00:49,956 --> 00:00:51,691
PEOPLE WOULD DEFEND THEM?

34
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:53,159
>> BECAUSE THERE IS ALWAYS

35
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,095
GOING TO BE SOMEBODY WHO IS

36
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:58,965
GOING TO TAKE SOMETHING THAT

37
00:00:58,965 --> 00:00:59,933
THE PRESIDENT SAYS AND TAKE

38
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:00,967
IT OUT OF CONTEXT.

39
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:02,268
THEN BE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE

40
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:03,169
OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

41
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:04,069
TRYING TO DO.

42
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,271
WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST

43
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:08,141
TRYING TO HELP US, NOT MY

44
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:10,009
FAMILY BUT HELP US, THE

45
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:10,610
UNITED STATES.

46
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,879
THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED

47
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,213
STATES.

48
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:14,514
WITH THIS PROBLEM WITH THE

49
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:15,682
MS-13 HOW IT'S RUINING

50
00:01:15,682 --> 00:01:18,084
FAMILIES.

51
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:18,852
>> Tucker: IT SURE IS.

52
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:19,919
WE ARE PROBABLY ROUGHLY THE

53
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:20,420
SAME AGE.

54
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,389
I MEAN, MS-13 DIDN'T EXIST

55
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:23,223
WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

56
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:25,458
>> NO, THEY DIDN'T.

57
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,493
I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN

58
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:27,727
AROUND FOR MAYBE 20 YEARS IN

59
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:29,729
THE UNITED STATES.

60
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,168
>> Tucker: YEAH.

61
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:36,369
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TO

62
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:36,803
YOUR DAUGHTER.

63
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:40,907
>> MY DAUGHTER MICKENS WAS

64
00:01:40,907 --> 00:01:42,976
ATTACKED THE EVE OF HER 16TH

65
00:01:42,976 --> 00:01:43,343
BIRTHDAY.

66
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:45,345
WALKING WITH HER BEST FRIEND

67
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:46,846
BACK TO KAYLA'S HOUSE AND

68
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:48,114
THESE VICIOUS ANIMALS

69
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:49,149
APPROACHED THEM AND DECIDED

70
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:54,154
TO KILL BOTH OF THEM OVER A

71
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:54,888
DISPUTE THAT HAPPENED IN

72
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:55,889
HIGH SCHOOL BETWEEN KAYLA

73
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:58,057
AND ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF

74
00:01:58,057 --> 00:01:58,425
MS-13.

75
00:01:58,425 --> 00:01:59,125
>> Tucker: HAD NOTHING TO DO

76
00:01:59,125 --> 00:01:59,659
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER?

77
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:00,794
>> MY DAUGHTER WAS JUST AT

78
00:02:00,794 --> 00:02:05,598
THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG

79
00:02:05,598 --> 00:02:08,101
TIME SHE REALI WAS.

80
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:08,768
>> Tucker: I'M SORRY ABOUT

81
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,068
THAT.

82
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:09,803
>> THANK YOU.

83
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:10,402
>> Tucker: WHAT DID THE

84
00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:11,104
PRESIDENT SAY TO YOU TODAY?

85
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:12,672
>> HE SAID WE ARE WORKING

86
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:12,973
HARD.

87
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,541
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE

88
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,142
FIGHTING TO ERADICATE THIS

89
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:18,612
GANG AND AMERICA HAS GIVEN

90
00:02:18,612 --> 00:02:19,813
US NOTHING BUT SUPPORT ABOUT

91
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:20,480
WHAT HAPPENED TO US AND TO

92
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,948
THE OTHER FAMILIES THAT ALSO

93
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:22,882
SUFFERED THE SAME WAY

94
00:02:22,882 --> 00:02:25,685
THROUGH THE CRIMES OF THE

95
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:25,986
MS-13.

96
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:27,721
HE IS STICKING BEHIND US

97
00:02:27,721 --> 00:00:00,000
100 PERCENT AND SO AM I.
