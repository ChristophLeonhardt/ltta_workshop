>> Laura: YESTERDAY, THE NFL
ANNOUNCED IT WILL REQUIRE
PLAYERS TO EITHER STAND ON THE
FIELD OR REMAIN IN THE
LOCKER ROOM DURING THE PLAYING
OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
TODAY, NUMEROUS REPORTS SAID
THAT INSTEAD OF KNEELING DURING
THE ANTHEM, NFL PLAYERS ARE NOW
ALREADY PLANNING NEW WAYS TO
PROTEST.
THE EVER PATRIOTIC EDITORIAL
BOARD OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES"
HELPFULLY SUGGESTED THAT PLAYERS
RAISE BLACK GLOVED FISTS IN THE
AIR.
PRESIDENT TRUMP THINKS IT'S
IMPORTANT THAT ALL PLAYERS
RESPECT THE ANTHEM.
>> President Trump: I THINK
IT'S GOOD TO STAND PROUDLY FOR
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
WHERE YOU SHOULD BE PLAIN,
SHOULD BE THERE.
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN THE
COUNTRY.
YOU HAVE TO STAND PROUDLY FOR
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AND THE NFL
ON THE REST OF THE RIGHT THING.
>> Laura: LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT,
BABY.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS HILARIOUS.
SO TO PROTEST BE TOLERATED?
LET'S DEBATE THAT WITH THE
FORMER NFL STAR AND AUTHOR OF
THE NEW BOOK, ANTOINE C RIGHT.
LET'S GO TO YOU, ANTOINE.
LOOK, I THINK A LOT OF PLAYERS
ARE TIRED OF THIS WHOLE
CONTROVERSY, AND I BET IF YOU
REALLY TALK TO THEM THEY JUST
WANT TO PLAY FOOTBALL AND ENJOY
THE GAME THAT MOST OF THEM ARE
PLAYED AND A DECENT AMOUNT OF
MONEY TO PLAY.
BUT NEVERTHELESS, IT'S BUBBLED
UP AGAIN, WHY A NEW ROUND OF
PROTEST TO DRAG THE NFL THROUGH
YET ANOTHER SEASON OF
DISCONTENT?
>> I THINK PEOPLE WILL BRING WHY
WE EVEN ARE HAVING THIS COME
CONVERSATION.
THERE WERE NFL PLAYERS THAT
BELIEVED AT THE HANDS OF
LAW ENFORCEMENT, BLACK AND BROWN
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN
MISTREATED MISTREATED,
MISHANDLED AND KILLED HER.
AND THEY FEEL LIKE IT'S WRONG.
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY BASED ON
THE HALLMARKS OF DEMOCRACY AND
THE CONVERSATION HAS BEEN ABOUT
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON BEING
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
HE WANTS TO TELL NFL PLAYERS
WHAT THEY DO AND HOW THEY SHOULD
DO THEIR JOBS.
>> THEY HAVE AN OPINION, AND
THAT'S FAIR.
I MEAN NFL PLAYERS HAVE THEIR
OPINION, AND THE PRESIDENT IS
LIKE, YOU SHOULD STAND FOR THE
ANTHEM.
EVERYONE HAS A GIVE AND TAKE
CARE OF.
IF YOU ARE A FOOTBALL PLAYER,
YOU ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE
RULES OF THE NFL.
THE OWNERS TO WRITE THE RULES,
THE PLAYERS ASSOCIATION HAS
THEIR SAY.
AND BURGESS OWENS, OBVIOUSLY AS
A FORMER PLAYER YOURSELF, THE
RULES OF THE GAME ARE THE RULES
OF THE GAME AND THE OWNER SET
THE RULES.
THEY WERE GETTING TIRED OF THE
LOWER ATTENDANCE AND THE PUBLIC
UPSET OVER THIS, EVEN THOUGH
THEY ARE TRYING TO GO GLOBAL.
>> CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING
REALLY QUICK?
I'M GOING TO BRING A DIFFERENT
FLAVOR TO THIS THING BECAUSE IT
TAKES A LOT OF HARD WORK TO
BRING 60 YEARS TO MESS IT UP
WITHIN TWO YEARS.
THEY'VE EITHER BASED UPON TOTAL
INCOMPETENCE, RECKLESS
LEADERSHIP FOR ITS STUNNING
PURPOSE.
A COMMISSION IS PAID $40 MILLION
PER YEAR AND 90% OF THAT IS
BASED ON GROWTH INCENTIVE.
WE ARE LOOKING AT IT AS ELITIST.
YOU DON'T MIND THE MEANING OF
THE AMERICAN FLAG, TARNISHING
THE AMERICAN BRAND, BECAUSE IT
LOOKS LIKE INTERNATIONAL.
AND IF THEY CHANGE THE RULE, IF
THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE
GLOBAL BRAND, AND THUS IS THE
DEAL.
YOU CAN STAY IN THE LOCKER ROOM
IF YOU WANT TO HELP PROTEST.
OR YOU CAN STAND ON THE SIDELINE
AND THE KEY PAYS THE FINE.
NBA IS NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT
THIS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS
THAT THAT PLAYERS WILL RESPECT
THE CORPORATION AND RESPECT THE
FLAG.
>> Laura: THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
THE NBA DOESN'T HAVE THIS
PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE A RULE
THAT YOU STAND FOR THE ANTHEM
AND YOU RESPECT THE PLAYING OF
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, CORRECT?
THERE WAS A GREAT PIECE ON ESPN
ABOUT THIS.
>> A LITTLE KNOWN FACT, THE SAME
DAY THIS CAME DOWN BY NFL OWNERS
WHO BY THE WAY DID NOT HAVE AN
NFL REPRESENTATIVE IN THE ROOM
WHEN THEY MADE THIS DECISION.
THE SAME DAY THIS CAME DOWN A
VIDEO WAS RELEASED BY THE
MILWAUKEE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN
WHICH AN NBA PLAYER WAS TASED
OVER PARKING VIOLATIONS.
KEEP IN MIND WE ARE HAVING THIS
CONVERSATION AGAIN BECAUSE
AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND BLACK AND
BROWN PEOPLE ARE FIVE TIMES IS
MORE LIKELY TO BE INJURED OR
KILLED AT THE HANDS OF --
>> Laura: ANTOINE, WHAT DOES
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH A FOOTBALL
GAME?
>> Antoine: LAURA, --
>> Laura: WRITE AN OP-ED, MANY
OF THEM VOLUNTEER AND HAVE GREAT
CHARITIES, THAT'S FANTASTIC.
BUT PEOPLE TUNE IN TO WATCH THE
GAME.
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR
POLITICAL VIEWS, I HATE TO TELL
YOU.
THEY DON'T CARE.
B3 IF THEY DON'T CARE THEN WHY
IS THE PRESIDENT -- >> THEY USE,
ABUSE AND DISCARD.
ANTOINE, HOW ABOUT RESPECT, MY
FRIEND, WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN FOR
A FEW MINUTES.
WHAT THE NFL IS DOING IS
ACCUSING AMERICAN FANS AND
ABUSING THEM EVERY SINGLE
SUNDAY, SHARING THIS AIR OF
SOCIALISM AND ABLE TO SCORE
DISCARD THEM FOR INTERNATIONAL
FOREIGN VANS.
ALL THEY ARE DOING WITH THE NEW
PLAN COMPANY KEEPS THIS WHOLE
THING ALIVE.
WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS WHILE
PLAYERS ARE DECIDING HOW THEY
WANT TO DEMONSTRATE.
>> Laura: FINAL WORD, ANTOINE?
>> Antoine: BURGESS, LET ME
REMIND YOU, YOU LOOK LIKE ME.
>> I AM AN AMERICAN FIRST.
>> Antoine: ARE YOU GOING TO
LET ME FINISH MY POINT OR TALK
OVER ME?
PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE US HAVE IT
FIVE MORE TIMES LIKELY TO
EXPERIENCE BEING MISHANDLED AT
THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
THAT'S WHY THESE PLAYERS ARE
TAKING A KNEE AND THAT'S WHY
THEY ARE TAKING A STAND AND I
COMMEND THEM FOR THEIR EFFORTS.
I'M SORRY THIS PRESIDENT -- >>
WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF WHO WE
ARE.
>> Laura: GUYS, LOOK.
I THINK WE ALL WANT THINGS TO BE
BETTER.
WE ALL WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE JOBS,
WE WANT FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO
STAY TOGETHER.
WE WANT THE POLICE TO RESPECT
EVERYONE, AND I THINK THEY
GENERALLY DO BUT MISTAKES ARE
MADE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Laura: I DON'T THINK A LOT
