1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,410
PEOPLE WITH MONEY ARE SPENDING
$36 AN HOUR TO STRETCH.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:09,040
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOGA,
BUT THIS NEW WORK OUT THING

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,420
THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY
WHERE PEOPLE WHO REFER

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:19,869
THEMSELVES AS FLEXOLOGISTS WILL
STRETCH YOU.

5
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:34,039
LET ME GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS.

6
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:38,590
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS A COMPANY
CALLED STRETCH ZONE.

7
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:56,630
JUST GO TO A 
YOGA CLASS AND SHUT

8
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,539
UP.

9
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:04,610
I'M BEING TOO NEGATIVE I FEEL.

10
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,120
BUT $36 AN HOUR?

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,920
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO
OR JOURNALISM RIGHT,

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,290
$36 FOR HALF AN HOUR.

13
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,939
>> THAT I MISREAD IT?

14
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:21,149
>>YES.

15
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:27,210
>> OH MY GOD, HE'S RIGHT.

16
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,950
>> WHEN I WAS A LAW STUDENT I
WAS SO PSYCHED WHEN I GOT MY

17
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,210
FIRST PART-TIME LAWN JOB
BECAUSE IT PAID A NUMBER I HAD

18
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,149
NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE BEFORE,
$25 AN HOUR.

19
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:44,030
I REMEMBER MY DAD USED TO PAY
ME TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR IN

20
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,030
CONSTRUCTION.

21
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:52,060
I THOUGHT I WAS RICH, THIS IS
$72 AN HOUR FOR STRETCHING.

22
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:58,969
>>THAT'S THE THING, PEOPLE PAY
FOR ANYTHING TO MAKE THEMSELVES

23
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:02,470
FEEL GOOD OR CONVINCE
THEMSELVES.

24
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:08,070
THE REALITY IS YOU CAN STRETCH
ON YOUR OWN.

25
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,069
FITNESS EXPERTS SAY THE BENEFITS
OF STRETCHING ARE OVERBLOWN.

26
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:13,730
I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT A FITNESS
EXPERT.

27
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:19,510
THE POINT IS THERE ARE PEOPLE
OUT THERE THAT WANT TO RIP

28
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,860
YOU OFF.

29
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,560
AGAIN I FEEL LIKE I'M BEING TOO
MEAN TO THESE PEOPLE AND I

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,190
DON'T MEAN TO.

31
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,500
BUT YOU ARE RIPPING
PEOPLE OFF DUDE,

32
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,459
$36 FOR A HALF HOUR OF
STRETCHING?

33
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,610
>>IF PEOPLE WANT TO PAY BLESS
THEIR HEARTS.

34
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,810
AT THE SAME TIME DON'T.

35
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,170
I KNOW WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE.

36
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:50,170
I 
HAVE BEEN STRETCHING MY WHOLE

37
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,170
LIFE, BUT I KNOW THAT MY BODY

38
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,349
DOESN'T SHOW IT.

39
00:02:53,349 --> 00:03:00,010
I OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THE
BODY TYPE FOR IT BUT I DO

40
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,910
EXERCISE FOUR TIMES A WEEK
ROUGHLY AND I HAVE FOR DECADES.

41
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,819
STRETCHING IS GREAT.

42
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:10,160
JUST THIS WEEK BEFORE I READ
THE STORY I WAS THINKING OF

43
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,900
WHAT ARE THE UPSIDES OF ME
DOING EXERCISE SO MUCH?

44
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,160
I SAID I ALSO GET TO STRETCH AND
IT HELPS YOUR BODY.

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,319
IF YOU DON'T EXERCISE AND DON'T
STRETCH IT IS A BAD IDEA.

46
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,480
BUT IF ALL YOU DO IS STRETCH
LIKE THIS ñ AND THEN YOU GO BACK

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,629
AND SIT ON THE COUCH ñ

48
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:32,689
>>I KNOW.

49
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:37,930
ONE PERSON WHO TAKES THESE
CLASSES SAYS AFTER DOING THESE

50
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,349
STRETCHING CLASSES THAT WHEN HE
GOES TO SLEEP AT NIGHT HE FEELS

51
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:46,950
LIKE HE WENT FOR ROUNDS WITH
MIKE TYSON.

52
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,930
>>NO YOU DIDN'T.

53
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,290
STRETCHING ISN'T EXCELLENT START
TO YOUR EXERCISE.

54
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,319
BUT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO KEEP
GOING.

55
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,950
AS YOU CAN TELL I AM NOT AN
EXERCISE NOT EITHER.

56
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,220
WHEN I FIRST STARTED EXERCISING
I WALKED FOR A QUARTER OF A

57
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,989
MILE AND THOUGHT I AM DONE.

58
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,840
>>YOU HAVE TO START SLOW.

59
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,440
>> IF YOU WANT TO START WITH
STRETCHING, BLESS YOUR

60
00:04:12,440 --> 00:00:00,000
HEART, BUT THEN KEEP IT GOING.
