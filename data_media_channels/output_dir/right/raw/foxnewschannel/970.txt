00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:02,779
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

GREAT JOB OVER THERE, AWESOME

6
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:08,518
REPORTING.

7
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:09,619
>> I APPRECIATE IT.

8
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:11,454
>> Martha: JOINED ME NOW ON

9
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:12,255
SKYPE ON THE ANDREW McCABE

10
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:16,459
ISSUE IS ALAN DERSHOWITZ.

11
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:18,261
GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

12
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:20,263
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE SUIT THAT

13
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:21,831
WAS JUST BROUGHT BY ANDREW

14
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:23,700
McCABE AGAINST DOJ AND FBI IN

15
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,100
HIS FIRING?

16
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,835
>> I'M SURPRISED IT TOOK SO

17
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:26,469
LONG.

18
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:28,471
OF COURSE HE WAS RIGHT TO BRING

19
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:28,872
THE LAWSUIT.

20
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:30,273
NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW, BUT NO

21
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:31,975
ONE IS BENEATH THE LAW.

22
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:34,010
HE'S ENTITLED TO SEE THE

23
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,146
DOCUMENTATION THAT RESULTED IN

24
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:36,880
HIS REPUTATION BEING DESTROYED.

25
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,981
HE IS ENTITLED TO SEE WHAT

26
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:38,615
EVIDENCE THEY REALLY HAVE

27
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:39,916
AGAINST HIM.

28
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,286
HE'S ENTITLED TO CHALLENGE THE

29
00:00:43,286 --> 00:00:45,622
REPORT OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL.

30
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:46,856
HE'S ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS

31
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:47,524
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS

32
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:51,528
ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS.

33
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:52,262
IN A HYPERPARTISAN AGE IN WHICH

34
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:54,564
WE LIVE, PEOPLE WANT TO GET DUE

35
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:55,298
PROCESS ONLY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE

36
00:00:55,298 --> 00:00:58,702
ON THEIR SIDE AND     AND NOT PO

37
00:00:58,702 --> 00:00:58,735
ON THEIR SIDE AND     AND NOT PL

38
00:00:58,735 --> 00:00:58,768
ON THEIR SIDE AND     AND NOT PE

39
00:00:58,768 --> 00:00:58,802
ON THEIR SIDE AND     AND NOT PI

40
00:00:58,802 --> 00:00:59,035
ON THEIR SIDE AND     AND NOT PN

41
00:00:59,035 --> 00:00:59,502
THE OTHER SIDE.

42
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:00,837
I DON'T CARE ABOUT SIZE.

43
00:01:00,837 --> 00:01:02,138
I ONLY CARE ABOUT DUE PROCESS

44
00:01:02,138 --> 00:01:04,074
AND THE CONSTITUTION.

45
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:05,275
HE'S ENTITLED TO A MATTER OF DUE

46
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:07,043
PROCESS TO SEE THE EVIDENCE

47
00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:08,178
AGAINST HIM, TO CONFRONT

48
00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:08,912
WITNESSES AGAINST HIM AND TO BE

49
00:01:08,912 --> 00:01:10,347
TREATED FAIRLY.

50
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:13,650
>> Martha: FASCINATING.

51
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,851
IN TERMS OF THIS OTHER ROD

52
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:15,552
ROSENSTEIN ISSUE THAT WE WERE

53
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:18,722
JUST DISCUSSING AND THE FACT

54
00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:19,456
THAT HE APPEARS TO BE BULLYING

55
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:23,126
THE LEADERSHIP ON THAT HOUSE

56
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:23,860
INTEL COMMITTEE AND THREATENING

57
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,864
THEM WITH SUBPOENAS ITSELF OR HE

58
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:29,633
WOULD LIKE THEM TO PRODUCE, WHAT

59
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:31,201
DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

60
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:33,937
>> THIS IS A CLASSIC DISPUTE

61
00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:35,772
BETWEEN SEPARATION OF POWERS.

62
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:37,407
THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE POWER,

63
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:40,610
OBVIOUSLY, TO OVERSEE AND

64
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,147
INVESTIGATE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

65
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:44,748
INVESTIGATE THE EXECUTIVE BRANC

66
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:45,649
BRANCH, AND A MEMBER OF THE

67
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:47,450
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, WHICH ROD

68
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,652
ROSENSTEIN'S, SHOULDN'T BE ABLE

69
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:50,253
TO BULLY THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.

70
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:52,322
HE SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT.

71
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:53,923
HE SHOULD TURN OVER THE

72
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:54,290
DOCUMENTS.

73
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,493
HE SHOULD BE COOPERATIVE AND

74
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:57,260
CONGRESS SHOULD BE COOPERATIVE

75
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,228
WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

76
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:01,665
WE HAVE SO MUCH DISPUTE TODAY,

77
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:02,465
PARTISAN DISPUTE.

78
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:03,833
DISPUTE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE

79
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,701
AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

80
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,636
THEY ARE ALL REPUBLICANS.

81
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:07,537
THEY SHOULDN'T BE FIGHTING WITH

82
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:08,638
EACH OTHER.

83
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:09,606
IT'S ONE THING WHEN YOU HAVE THE

84
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:11,574
HOUSE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE

85
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:12,308
DEMOCRATS, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN

86
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:16,246
THE END OF THIS YEAR, OR THE

87
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:17,447
SENATE IN CONTROL OF THE OTHER

88
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:17,747

HERE WE HAVE EVERYBODY AND THEY
