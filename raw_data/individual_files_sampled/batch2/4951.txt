michael cohen secrets are actually starting to spill out in a bigger way and it suggests more clues as to why there were raids on his office in his hotel room why Donald Trump seems unnerved and we have some special guests on that also some breaking news on that which might get to in a moment the question of course is the big one what did Trump know about all this there's new reporting that Cohen was raising millions of dollars because of explicitly his link to Trump not his expertise not anything he would do by himself and now breaking at this very moment I just got this paper Washington Post reporting AT&T well they didn't just want Michael Cohen's insights what they wanted was something from the Trump administration and that three days after Donald Trump was sworn into office they wanted Michael Cohen's help getting approval for their gigantic expensive merger with Time Warner that news as we've discovered Cohen's whole pitch to prospective clients was about again what he could do through the Trump administration for them he said he was Trump's lawyer he showed off photos of them together he talked about how often they spoke he even asked others to share news articles that described him with that word that sounds like maybe not a compliment his quote Fixer and when Cohen wasn't pitching himself privately he publicly played up how closely he would be working with Trump here he was actually just two days before the inauguration I'm going to be the personal attorney to mr. Trump I'm not going to be in government but I'm going to remain technically in the same role for mr. Trump for president Trump as I was when he was president of the Trump organisation that clip looks very different in the light of what's under investigation tonight maybe it did help Michael Cohen land some you know some fair amount of money he also told an associate we're learning last summer quote I'm crushing it with regard to this money that he was raising and that caught Muller's interest because two of the companies that go and work with Novartis and AT&T have now confirmed new this week that they started cooperating with Bob Miller's investigators last year in November and then hours after that news broke a message from the White House shut this Miller probe down it's been about a year since this investigation began our administration has provided over a million documents we fully cooperated in it and in the interest of the country I think it's time to wrap it up you know Mike Pence speaks so calmly he can make almost anything sound reasonable for a second but what he just said there today to MSNBC is totally inappropriate whether you're Mother Teresa or El Chapo when you're under investigation the timeline of the investigation is not your call it's Bob Miller's call Mike Pence knows that but it seems like all of a sudden with all this heat now Donald Trump is getting back up on the records from Mike Pence his potential successor and what many describe is an ongoing effort to turn these rules upside down and put improper pressure on the DOJ I'm joined now by a man who knows Michael Cohen and a lot of these players Reverend Al Sharpton the host of course of politics nation and Richard painter former White House ethics chief for George W Bush he is running for Senate as a Democrat in Minnesota mr. painter I begin with you on the basic question does Mike Pence as a member of the administration as a potential successor and as a potential witness have any proper role in trying to tell the DOJ when or how to wrap it up of course not he's got an interest in this and of course he'd like it to stop now Bob Moore has already uncovered enough evidence almost certainly to jeopardize Donald Trump's presidency particularly what it's publicly disclosed that information and that might put Mike Pence in the White House this investigation keeps going a little bit further and Bob Miller may uncover some information that is very compromising about Mike Pence as well so of course he'd like it to stop now he's eyeing the Oval Office but that's not the way it works this investigation is going to go at the pace that Robert Muller determines is appropriate and the United States House and Senate should be having investigations to in their Judiciary Committees that's what they were doing in 374 with actually less evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors and what we have going on right now but the House and Senate aren't doing anything so at this point the Muller investigation is the only game in town right on the rest of this scuffling I want to turn to Reverend Al Sharpton people know you for your work for your journalism for your civil rights record but you are also a New York Politico and we are seeing a lot of New York figures in Rudy Giuliani who you have a long history with in Michael Cohen all over this national news look at the news today that Rudy has separated from his law firm over this they say they won't condone payments of the nature alleged to have been made regarding stormy Daniels the firm after this time story broke disputed the way that quote was used but there's no dispute that he's out Michael Cohen is someone you know as a robust defender of Donald Trump and close to him what is your analysis of a the story line here the Cohen was selling not just his work which is legal but his potential ability to make things happen inside the Trump administration I think that where the danger lies which is why you may see an intensity and the Trump allies trying to stop the investigation is that what they need to get they being the mullah investigators or the Southern District federal investigators they need leverage on Michael Kahn to get him to cooperate if he in fact has some things to give on the president well if mr. Cohen was representing to any of these companies Novartis or AT&T anything that he could not deliver then you're talking about he's exposed to defrauding people for their money wire fraud any number of things which again gives more leverage for him to talk about making a deal well let's let's put a point on it this new reporting breaking this hour that AT&T was under the impression they were getting help from Michael Cohen to get the US government to approve a very profitable merger does that sound to you like Michael Cohen lying to AT&T Michael Cohen lobbying the Trump administration off-the-books one would have to say he was either lobbying off the books which is illegal or that he was defrauding one of the companies in Haiti which gives them the leverage to come in I say we have all of this mr. corn now all the things you want to tell us which would then cause some of the Trump people to say we need to just shut this down because they're the only ones that know whatever Michael called may or may not know not necessarily about this particular deal but about anything I think that there is as you just said in the introduction is some strange timing here on some inappropriate statements by the vice president so I agree that he is has a self-interest here but he may not be savoring his self-interest he may be being told by those like the president we need to start a drumbeat to shut this down right because they may feel that they are gathering enough pressure to make Michael Kahn say whatever it is he may say we don't know whether that exists for clearly I mean you're the lawyer you are clearly they want the leverage and this could give them leverage well I am a lawyer and I appreciate you saying that Richard well Michael crow is receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from people all over the world who want to influence the President of the United States he is also pushing money out the door on behalf of Donald Trump in payoffs we know about the stormy Daniels playoff we don't know how many others there are so the question comes up of whether this is money that is directly or indirectly intended not just from Michael Cohen but for Donald Trump whether there are payments in return for access to Donald Trump that we would think about as bribery but for the fact that the Supreme Court of the United States in a case involving the former governor of Virginia McDonald they've ruled that well payment of money in return for access to the politician isn't bribery there has to be an actual quid pro quo of official action and that's the theory that Senator Menendez got off the hook to on I think it's it's tragic for our country that the message is being sent to huge corporations and the Russian oligarchs that we're open for business just send money to the president's personal lawyer and you're gonna get access to the President of the United States its corruption he's disgusting in most countries we define it as bribery criminal bribery well Richard painter you dig deep as you often do and citing the US v McDonald case which was by the way an eight to zero unanimous decision that is we've covered on this show does make it harder to prosecute corruption is is an interesting piece whether Muller has more than one road is something of course that we're also keeping an eye on my thanks to Richard painter a special note about Reverend Sharpton I was just talking about his work on civil rights there is an important interview on criminal justice reform with the artist and rapper Meek Mill it's airing this Sunday we want to tell our viewers about that we will be watching that and I turn now directly to Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal on the Judiciary Committee senator I want to talk to you about all of it what what strikes you is most important at this hour what strikes me as profoundly important areare two points first of all that statement by vice president Pence is truly chilling it is ominous not only as to the special counsel robert muller but also as to rod Rosenstein and i have begun to think that the threat to the deputy attorney general who controls the magnitude and scope and timing of this investigation is as dire as it is to bomb our second point do you think my defense is implying that he cosines that kind of move it certainly indicates very clearly that he is one with the president he's joined at the hip in feeling this investigation must be shut down and part of the impetus and we've seen the president's reaction to that raid on Michael cone is that cone is in big trouble deepening trouble and that means big and deepening trouble for Trump and what is emerging here is a picture of Michael cone as a key figure in Donald Trump's relationships to the Russians his involvement pre-election in contacts with the Russian and now post-election in receiving a payment from a Russian oligarch through a conduit but at a the very time he is going to Donald Trump in the Oval Office and delivering a message about how lifting sanctions should be done right and then a written message to the then Security Advisor Michael Flynn about lifting those sanctions on the Russians senators stay with me I want to add one more reporter to the mix with a very interesting piece that Amy Davidson Sorkin staff writer for The New Yorker magazine she questions if Michael Cohen's LLC was effectively a slush fund for Donald Trump and you have a turn of phrase in here that's pretty striking viewers are familiar with the tendency for us to discuss many developments in these stories as big or bombshells or turning points but this one does feel different because of the the evidence of it the money trail which cannot be explained away it cannot be denied the way other things can and so you write you know if I just read you you do you Tuesdays revelations felt a bit like the moment in November 1986 when it was revealed that the money from the Reagan administration's secret sale of weapons to Iran in the interest of freeing American hostages had been diverted to of all people the Nicaraguan Contras which was certainly an iran-contra turning point explain yeah well one thing that happens when you make a sale or make a deal that you're not really supposed to is that you have cash you need to put it somewhere there was a moment I think I think Oliver North described it as a neat idea that you can take this money that you thought from doing one thing you weren't supposed to do and use it to do something else you weren't supposed to do at that point there were congressional limits on the money that could be given to the country be fair Oliver North had a point in that two wrongs do make a right not exactly but it's an example of how money when you have this money around then you have the secondary problem how launder the money how you get the money from one place to the other and that can make you do strange things like putting money from AT&T in an account that's also used to pay for hush agreements or bingo I mean you're so you're talking about something that to the normal normal observer looks totally crazy you open an account to pay stormy Daniels in October and now you're putting these other funds which they're claiming might be for a legitimate purpose in the secret account to pay off stormy Daniels it looks dumb but you're saying it might be different than dumb it might just be the bag if he's the bagman essential consultants looks like the bag like it could be maybe there's some semi shady or less totally shady explanations for it but even in the Washington of companies buying access paying people who are close to the president it's not usually the president's personal attorney and if AT&T thought that Michael Cohen was gonna give them some cover what about him and his past or the president made them think that this wasn't going to end up like humiliating transaction so that goes to what Bob Muller allegedly wants to ask Donald Trump and Senator I'm gonna get your view as well as Amy's on this because of the reporting I'm reading here from those leaked documents which again look different today this is a question that Moeller wants to ask the president what communication did you have with Michael Cohen as well as others including foreign nationals about Russian real estate developments during the campaign so I go to you first Amy and then the senator this question has a premise and the premise is that essential consultants in October 2016 may not have been the first off-the-books container may not have been the first secret bag to use your nomenclature that Michael Cohen was reaching for with shady money no I mean Michael Cohen setup essential consultants right before the payment to stormy Daniels maybe he felt he had it lying around but there's one key thing that Rudy Giuliani said in one of the many things he said that was damaging to his clients President Trump he said that that Michael would take care things like those expenses for the president and that the president would make sure one way or the other somehow he got that he got paid back but may be paid back by the legal third party let me bring in exactly senator Ari you're hitting a key area of inquiry and Robert Muller is following the money and he knows way more than we do he was asking AT&T and Novartis questions back in November and here's part of the pattern in practice Michael cone raised money from the Russians way back when no one else with long Donald Trump money he was Donald Trump's emissary to the Russians in trying to build that Hotel in Moscow then he had contacts with Russians during the campaign now we have evidence of a payment from viktor vessel berg that led Michael Cone to approach Donald Trump in the Oval Office about lifting those sanctions on the Russians there's a pattern here and you can well understand why they want to end this investigation wrap it up right and that's why the Senate needs to take action to protect the investigation the bills on the floor of the Senate Mitch McConnell said there's no need for it because there will never be an effort by the president to shut down the investigation I think Michael Pence's recent remarks ought to end that kind of wishful thinking hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date
