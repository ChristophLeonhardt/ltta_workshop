1
00:00:01,163 --> 00:00:02,330
PLUS, PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKES A

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,200
STATEMENT BY CELEBRATING THE

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,901
NATION INSTEAD OF THE NATIONAL

4
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:07,969
FOOTBALL LEAGUE.

5
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:11,072
BUT FIRST, WE HAVE BIG BREAKING

6
00:00:11,072 --> 00:00:13,074
NEWS FROM CAPITOL HILL.

7
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:17,195
FORMER FBI

8
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:22,951
DIRECTOR ANDREW

9
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:26,888
McCABE IS OFFERING COMMITMENT.

10
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:27,622
FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA

11
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:32,561
LYNCH TO TESTIFY WHEN THE IG

12
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:33,495
REPORT ON THE HILLARY CLINTON

13
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:36,565
EMAIL INVESTIGATION IS FINALLY

14
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:42,771
RELEASED.

15
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:47,476
REPORTING THIS.

16
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:53,815
THE FBI ESPIONAGE CHIEF HAS BEEN

17
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:54,382
VERY COOPERATIVE WITH

18
00:00:54,382 --> 00:01:04,358
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS.

19
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:05,961
THE SOURCE SAYS THAT STRUCK

20
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:06,695
PLAYED AN EVEN LARGER ROLE THAN

21
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:09,731
WE THOUGHT INITIALLY IN THE

22
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:11,800
CLINTON EMAIL PROBE AND THE

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,767
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION.

24
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:13,802
LET'S DISCUSS ALL OF THIS NOW

25
00:01:13,802 --> 00:01:21,743
WITH CONGRESSMAN RON DeSANTIS,

26
00:01:21,743 --> 00:01:24,112
DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST RICHARD

27
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:24,980
GOODSTEIN AND A FORMER DEPUTY

28
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,348
ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL

29
00:01:26,348 --> 00:01:26,815
ROBERT DRISCOLL.

30
00:01:26,815 --> 00:01:27,816
GENTLEMEN, IT'S GREAT TO SEE ALL

31
00:01:27,816 --> 00:01:30,819
OF YOU.

32
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:31,853
WHERE DO WE BEGIN, LET'S START

33
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:36,625
WITH THIS IMMUNITY PLEA FOR

34
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:37,158
McCABE.

35
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:39,294
EVERY TIME YOU HEAR SOMEONE

36
00:01:39,294 --> 00:01:40,428
CONNECTED WITH TRUMP WHO MIGHT

37
00:01:40,428 --> 00:01:42,964
WANT IMMUNITY, IT'S LIKE, OH, MY

38
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:44,366
GOSH, YOU WANT IMMUNITY, YOU

39
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:45,534
MUST BE GUILTY.

40
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:48,370
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

41
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,638
JAMES COMEY STOOD TALL AND WAS A

42
00:01:49,638 --> 00:01:50,839
MODEL LEADER AND NOW HE WANTS

43
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:53,942
IMMUNITY BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE'S

44
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:55,677
JEOPARDY WITH HIS CONDUCT OVER

45
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:56,945
THIS INVESTIGATION, BOTH THE

46
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:58,146
CLINTON AND THE TRUMP

47
00:01:58,146 --> 00:01:58,580
INVESTIGATION.

48
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,382
I WOULD NOT GIVE HIM IMMUNITY, I

49
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:02,017
WOULD MAKE HIM GO, IF HE'S GOING

50
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:03,285
TO PLEAD THE FIFTH AMENDMENT

51
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:04,152
THEN HE SHOULD PLEAD THE FIFTH

52
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:05,620
AMENDMENT BUT THE IDEA THAT HE

53
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,889
SHOULD GET SOME TYPE OF GET OUT

54
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:10,225
OF JAIL FREE CARD FOR THIS IS

55
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,793
NOT SOMETHING THE AMERICAN

56
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:14,262
PEOPLE WILL WANT TO SEE.

57
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:14,996
>> Laura: RICHARD?

58
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:17,399
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID IN TWEETS

59
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:20,035
ABOUT McCABE, LIED, LIED,

60
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:20,602
LIED.

61
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:23,638
HE CALLED HIS WIFE A LOSER,

62
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:25,340
CLASSIC MOVE.

63
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:25,640
BIG --

64
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,542
>> WE HAVE VERY LIMITED TIME, I

65
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:30,378
WANT TO KEEP US FOCUSED ON THE

66
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:31,112
FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

67
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:31,613
WANTING IMMUNITY.

68
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:32,881
IF HE HAD NOTHING TO HIDE A

69
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:35,584
COMPANY IF HE WAS A BORE AND HAD

70
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:37,185
INFORMATION TO RELEASE TO THE

71
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:39,754
MEDIA, WHY WAS HE ASKING FOR

72
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:40,121
IMMUNITY?

73
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:41,957
>> THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

74
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:43,692
WHEN THE PRESIDENT ASKED FOR THE

75
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:45,560
FIFTH AMENDMENT, PLEASE BRING

76
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,061
THAT BACK.

77
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:47,963
>> Laura: WHEN IS THE

78
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:49,331
PRESIDENT ASKING FOR THE FIFTH

79
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:49,731
AMENDMENT?

80
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:52,934
>> HERE'S WHAT I MEAN.

81
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:58,340
IF YOU HAVE AN PRESIDENT THAT

82
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,941
ISSUES PARDONS WILLY-NILLY,

83
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:01,576
McCABE WOULD BE OUT OF HIS

84
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:02,777
MIND NOT TO SEEK IMMUNITY WHEN

85
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:05,080
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS AT THE

86
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,748
TOP OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

87
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:08,750
>> Laura: RICHARD COME HIS OWN

88
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,918
LAWYER IS SAYING HE'S CONCERNED.

89
00:03:09,918 --> 00:03:11,219
>> HE SHOULD BE CONCERNED WHEN

90
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:13,588
HE HAS THE PRESIDENT GOING AFTER

91
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:14,255
PEOPLE LIKE CRAZY.

92
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:16,024
>> Laura: THIS IS A CRIMINAL

93
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:18,259
REFERRAL, THOUGH THAT WAS MADE

94
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,394
BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL.

95
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:20,962
THE INSPECTOR GENERALLY THE

96
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:21,796
PREDICATE FOR THIS.

97
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:23,798
I GET IT THAT YOU DON'T LIKE

98
00:03:23,798 --> 00:03:24,399
TRUMP.

99
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,533
IT'S A BIG NATION AND I'M GLAD

100
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:26,901
WE HAVE OPINIONS ON THE SHOW.

101
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:33,074
BUT THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IN A

102
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:36,544
NONPARTISAN CONSONANT

103
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:38,847
PROFESSIONAL INSPECTOR GENERAL,

104
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:42,751
HE BASICALLY SAID HE WAS

105
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:46,154
PREVARICATING, TO PUT IT KINDLY.

106
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:48,089
ROBERT, YOU CAN CHIME IN, YOU

107
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:50,025
HAVE EXPERIENCED, AND HE WANTS

108
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:50,392
IMMUNITY.

109
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:51,760
THIS IS A WILD SERIES OF

110
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,462
DEVELOPMENTS THAT WE HAVE HAD

111
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:55,597
WITH THE FORMER FBI DEPUTY

112
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:55,997
DIRECTOR.

113
00:03:55,997 --> 00:03:57,966
>> AND SMART MOVE BY HIS LAWYER

114
00:03:57,966 --> 00:03:59,534
BECAUSE IF HE GETS IMMUNITY BY

115
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:02,404
JUDICIARY THAN HE IS FREE FROM

116
00:04:02,404 --> 00:04:03,405
PROSECUTION BY DOJ.

117
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:07,008
SO YOU'D RATHER HAVE AND

118
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:08,209
EMBARRASSMENT THEN DUE TIME.

119
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,013
IT'S ALWAYS A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN

120
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:12,714
TRANSPARENCY AND JUSTICE WHEN

121
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:14,249
THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES AND

122
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:19,821
DOJ ARE DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT

123
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:25,727
TO GRANT IMMUNITY.

124
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,461
HE WOULD HAVE TO SAY EVERYTHING

125
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:27,195
HE KNOWS AND EVERYONE WILL HEAR

126
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:27,462
IT.

127
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:28,196
I THINK THE CHAIRMAN WOULD HAVE

128
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:28,930
TO WEIGH THAT AGAINST WAITING TO

129
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,531
SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

130
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,198
DAY-TO-DAY PROSECUTION WHICH

131
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:30,899
WOULD TAKE ADDITIONAL MONTHS.

132
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:33,134
>> I THINK ALSO, DOES HE HAVE

133
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:35,770
EVIDENCE, THERE ARE AT LEAST

134
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,441
SOME REPORTS SUGGESTING THAT HE

135
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:41,576
MAY HAVE AFFIRMATIVE EVIDENCE.

136
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:42,310
COMEY SAID HE DIDN'T AUTHORIZE

137
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,379
THAT SO IF HE WAS PRODUCING

138
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:46,047
SOMETHING LIKE THAT --

139
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:49,384
>> Laura: BUT HE ALWAYS BACKS

140
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:51,553
UP COMEY.

141
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:53,521
BEFORE, WHEN THE TRUMP

142
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:56,357
CONVERSATION WITH COMEY AT THE

143
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:57,792
WHITE HOUSE, HE BASICALLY SAID

144
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:59,461
IT, HE BASICALLY SAID TO ME WHAT

145
00:04:59,461 --> 00:05:01,763
HE PUT IN HIS MEMO AT THE FILE.

146
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:04,165
>> ON THE LAKE, YOU SAID HE

147
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:06,601
APPROVED IT AND HE SAID HE

148
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:09,404
DIDN'T APPROVE IT SO THEY ARE IN

149
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:11,172
DIRECT DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THAT.

150
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:13,675
SO THIS IG REPORT, THE PRESIDENT

151
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:15,577
OBVIOUSLY VERY FRUSTRATED.

152
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:17,378
AGAIN, I WOULDN'T BE TWEETING

153
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:19,614
ABOUT WHY IT WAS DELAYED BUT THE

154
00:05:19,614 --> 00:05:21,382
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO TWEET.

155
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:23,384
BUT ON THE ISSUE OF THE IG

156
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:25,820
REPORT, WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS

157
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,187
DELAYED?

158
00:05:26,187 --> 00:05:27,956
WE KEEP HEARING IS GOING TO BE

159
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:29,724
OUT EVERY DAY.

160
00:05:29,724 --> 00:05:33,361
>> THAT'S A PROBLEM, LAURA, WE

161
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:34,763
HAVE A BUREAUCRACY THAT IS NOT

162
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:36,164
ACCOUNTABLE TO EVERYBODY.

163
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:37,465
SO WE HAD ALL THESE MAJOR

164
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:38,733
PROBLEMS AND THE DEMOCRATS WERE

165
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,368
THE ONES WHO WANTED THE REPORT.

166
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:42,203
IF IT TAKES A YEAR AND A HALF TO

167
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:46,074
CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION IT'S

168
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:51,079
NOT JUST -- YOU NEED A SPEEDY

169
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,380
TRIAL, YOU NEED A SPEEDY

170
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,881
RESOLUTION.

171
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:56,384
SHOWS 500 PAGES, COULD THAT

172
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:58,820
REQUEST FOR IMMUNITY HAVE SOME

173
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,089
RELEVANCE HERE IN THIS DELAY IN

174
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:02,590
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT?

175
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,560
>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE OVER

176
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,094
BLOWING THE DELAY.

177
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:08,263
WHEN THE REPORT IS DONE,

178
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:09,564
EVERYONE REPRESENTS SOMEONE WHO

179
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:11,366
HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THAT

180
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:12,767
REPORT, THEY GET TO REVIEW IT

181
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,169
ALONE IN A ROOM AND NOT TAKE IT

182
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:15,003
WITH THEM AND THEY HAVE A WEEK

183
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:16,671
TO GET BACK WITH ANY COMMENTS TO

184
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:17,605
THE IG WHO THEN DECIDES WHETHER

185
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:19,841
OR NOT TO TAKE THEM INTO

186
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:20,809
ACCOUNT, OR NOT.

187
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:22,443
SO THE FACT THAT TWO WEEKS AFTER

188
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:23,778
IT'S DONE IS ABOUT ON TIME --

189
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:24,779
I'D BE CONCERNED IF IT TOOK

190
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,181
ANOTHER WEEK OR SO BUT RIGHT

191
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:27,582
ABOUT NOW IS WHEN IT SHOULD BE

192
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:29,551
COMING OUT, IN MY EXPERIENCE,

193
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:30,552
FROM WHEN THE REPORT IS DONE TO

194
00:06:30,552 --> 00:06:32,253
WHEN YOU WORK THROUGH THAT

195
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:32,987
PROCESS.

196
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:34,622
THIS IS THE CIRCUMSTANCE AND

197
00:06:34,622 --> 00:06:37,492
THERE ARE LOTS OF HIGH-POWERED

198
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:40,094
LAWYERS INVOLVED AND MAKING

199
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:42,363
OBJECTIONS.

200
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,065
>> Laura: A LOT OF LAWYERS

201
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:44,933
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY HERE.

202
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,267
>> I WANT THIS TO COME OUT AS

203
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,236
SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT I HAVE

204
00:06:48,236 --> 00:06:48,736
DIFFERENT REASONS.

205
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:49,838
ONE I THINK WE WILL HEAR WHAT

206
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:51,439
RUDY GIULIANI WAS GETTING AWAY

207
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,807
OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT FROM

208
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:55,577
FBI AGENTS WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO

209
00:06:55,577 --> 00:06:56,978
BASICALLY SAY BEFORE IT HAPPENED

210
00:06:56,978 --> 00:06:58,379
THAT THE SECOND COMEY LETTER WAS

211
00:06:58,379 --> 00:06:59,581
GOING TO COME OUT.

212
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:01,416
SECOND, I THINK WE WILL SEE THAT

213
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,318
HE ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY BUT IN

214
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:05,153
WAYS THAT HELP THE TRUMP

215
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:05,787
CAMPAIGN.

216
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:07,288
HE SAT ON INFORMATION ABOUT THE

217
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:09,057
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION, AND THE

218
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:11,292
TRUMP CAMPAIGN, AND HE WAS WAY

219
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:13,228
OUT THERE IN WAYS THAT BROKE THE

220
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:14,596
RULES BOTH IN JULY AND OCTOBER I

221
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:16,798
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE HILLARY

222
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:17,398
EMAIL INVESTIGATION.

223
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:19,601
SO, I'M WITH YOU.

224
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:22,136
I AGREE, I HOPE IT COMES OUT

225
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:24,572
TOMORROW.

226
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:26,975
>>  >> Laura: WHAT DO YOU GUYS

227
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,177
THINK ABOUT THIS NEW TEXT?

228
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:30,879
IT'S A TEXT BETWEEN PETER STRZOK

229
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,512
AND LISA PAGE.

230
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:33,815
NOW WE LEARNED THIS TODAY

231
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:36,150
BECAUSE THIS WAS RELEASED AS

232
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,719
PART OF THE 500 PAGES OF TEXT

233
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:39,354
RELEASED BY THE SENATE TODAY.

234
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:41,789
HERE'S WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE.

235
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:47,562
IT SAYS, HE WILL GET OUR LURES

236
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:49,330
ARE APPROVED, WHICH IS FBI LINGO

237
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,298
FOR SPIES.

238
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:53,368
SO THE QUESTION TONIGHT, WITH

239
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:54,202
THESE SPIES POTENTIALLY SENT IN

240
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:57,171
TO TARGET THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

241
00:07:57,171 --> 00:08:00,341
GOING BACK TO DECEMBER OF 2015?

242
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:04,045
AND IF SO, THAT COULD BE FAIRLY

243
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:04,946
EXPLOSIVE, COULD IT NOT,

244
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:08,750
CONGRESSMAN?

245
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,052
BECAUSE COMEY SAID, THIS

246
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:12,320
INVESTIGATION BEGAN IN JULY.

247
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,856
THAT TEXT, AGAIN, AND WE WILL

248
00:08:14,856 --> 00:08:17,258
LEARN MORE, AND THE HOUSE IS NOT

249
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:18,426
EXACTLY WHERE THE SENATE IS ON

250
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:18,726
THIS.

251
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:21,863
BUT WHEN YOU READ THAT TEXT, IT

252
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:22,764
CERTAINLY APPEARS THAT THEY WERE

253
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:26,167
LOOKING TO PUT MORE LURES INTO

254
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,936
THE CAMPAIGN IN 2015.

255
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:28,970
SEVERAL PEOPLE ARE REPORTING

256
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,772
THIS TONIGHT AND WE WILL LEARN

257
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:32,039
MORE, I BELIEVE.

258
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,243
BUT WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT?

259
00:08:35,243 --> 00:08:36,577
WHY DID THEY REDACT THAT WORD?

260
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:40,347
IT INITIALLY CAME OUT AND IT IS

261
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:41,783
LIKE, OOPS, IT SAYS LURES THERE.

262
00:08:41,783 --> 00:08:45,219
>> SO THE QUESTION IS WHY WOULD

263
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:47,956
THAT HAVE BEEN REJECTED?

264
00:08:47,956 --> 00:08:48,890
I THINK THIS IDEA THAT

265
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,624
CROSS FIRE HURRICANE STARTED

266
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:52,627
THIS ON JULY 31ST, CLEARLY

267
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:54,629
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

268
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:55,863
YOU HAD COMEY, McCABE AND

269
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:57,031
LYNCH DECIDING NOT TO BRIEF

270
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:59,634
TRUMP IN APRIL WHEN THEY WERE

271
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:00,268
SUPPOSEDLY CONCERNED ABOUT

272
00:09:00,268 --> 00:09:00,702
CARTER PAGE.

273
00:09:00,702 --> 00:09:02,904
YOU HAD STEFON HALPER REACHING

274
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:04,305
OUT TO THE CAMPAIGN BEFORE THAT

275
00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:07,542
SO THIS DID NOT JUST START ON

276
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:10,745
THE 31ST OF JULY.

277
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:13,381
>> I THINK HE HAS EXPOSURE AS A

278
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:14,015
RESULT OF THAT TESTIMONY.

279
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:16,384
I DON'T THINK HE WAS TELLING THE

280
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:16,784
TRUTH THERE.

281
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:18,486
>> SO IS THERE ANY WAY HE

282
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:21,356
WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN, IF THIS IS

283
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:26,094
TRUE, THAT IT STARTED EARLIER?

284
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:27,161
PERHAPS IN MAY?

285
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:29,197
SO HE IS LIKE THE HEAD OF

286
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:29,897
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND PETER

287
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:32,033
STRZOK WEST'S NUMBER TWO.

288
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,501
NOW HE HAS BASICALLY SAID STRUCK

289
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:35,269
WAS BASICALLY THE MAIN GUY IN

290
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:38,072
BOTH THE HILLARY AND THE RUSSIAN

291
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:39,607
COLLISION INVESTIGATION.

292
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:41,042
OBVIOUSLY HE WANTED HILLARY AS

293
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:44,112
PRESIDENT AND HATED TRUMP WITH A

294
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:44,812
PASSION BUT, HE TRAVELED TO

295
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:47,181
LONDON IN MAY OF 2016.

296
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:50,451
THAT WAS, AGAIN, TWO MONTHS

297
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:51,819
BEFORE THE CROSS FIRE HURRICANE

298
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:52,153
STARTED.

299
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:53,488
>> I'M GOING TO DISAGREE WITH

300
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:55,390
THE CONGRESSMAN ELEMENT HERE.

301
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,157
WHAT'S TWISTED ABOUT THIS IS AT

302
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:59,827
THE END OF THE DAY, STRUCK

303
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:03,798
DRAFTED THE COMEY LETTER BEFORE

304
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:04,232
THE ELECTION.

305
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:07,769
HE ALSO SAID BAD THINGS ABOUT

306
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:08,970
ERNIE, CHELSEA AND HOLDER, IN

307
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,171
ADDITION TO TRUMP.

308
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,539
THE SAME THINGS THAT MARCO RUBIO

309
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:13,574
AND TED CRUZ WERE SAYING DURING

310
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:14,642
THE CAMPAIGN.

311
00:10:14,642 --> 00:10:18,279
THE FACT IS, FBI, WHEN YOU LOOK

312
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,749
BACK, THEY HELPED TRUMP BY

313
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:23,184
SITTING SITTING ON INFORMATION

314
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:23,651
ABOUT HIM.

315
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:26,454
>> THE REASON THEY PUT THE

316
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:27,688
LETTER OUT WAS TO PROTECT THEIR

317
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:28,389
OWN BEHIND.

318
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:31,526
STRUCK WANTED TO PROTECT HIS

319
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:34,462
BEHIND AND COMEY'S BEHIND.

320
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:35,797
BUT ONCE HE CAME OUT AND GAVE

321
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:40,368
THE PRESS CONFERENCE, A KIND OF

322
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:44,005
HAD TO GIVE THE LETTER.

323
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:45,373
>>  >> Laura: .

324
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:47,208
WE WILL LEARN MORE BUT THEY

325
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,210
REDACTED THE WORD LURES.

326
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,611
AGAIN, LINGO FOR SPIES.

327
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:51,913
FBI'S DON'T USE THE WORD SPIES

328
00:10:51,913 --> 00:10:55,416
BUT THEY USE THAT WORD.

329
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:59,821
NONCONTIGUOUS UNIDENTIFIED

330
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:00,221
INFORMANTS.

331
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:02,657
SO, THAT ACRONYM, AND THEN LURES

332
00:11:02,657 --> 00:11:03,724
WAS UNREDACTED.

333
00:11:03,724 --> 00:11:06,761
SO AGAIN, YOU GET ALL OF OUR

334
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:07,562
LURES APPROVED?

335
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:11,399
I LOVE THE LITTLE SMILEY FACE.

336
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,303
AND YOU KNOW, IT GOES ON FROM

337
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:15,603
THERE.

338
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,171
>> I THINK THE TIMELINE IS THE

339
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:18,773
MOST DAMAGING THING HERE BECAUSE

340
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:20,174
PEOPLE ARE USING A BUREAUCRATIC

341
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:22,176
TERM WHEN THEY SAY COME

342
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:22,977
INVESTIGATION WASN'T OPEN.

343
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:24,579
WHILE THAT MEANS NOTHING IF

344
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:26,581
THERE WAS INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITY

345
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,615
GOING ON BEFORE THE

346
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,583
INVESTIGATION WAS OPENED.

347
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,985
SO EVEN THE FBI SAID, SOME OF

348
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:35,389
THESE CONTACTS FROM OUR

349
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:36,991
INFORMANTS/SPIES OCCURRED

350
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:38,192
LEADING UP TO THE INVESTIGATION.

351
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:40,328
WELL, IT'S KIND OF LIKE, DID GOD

352
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:41,596
CREATE THE EARTH?

353
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:44,165
WHO CREATED THAT, WHO CREATED

354
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:45,032
THAT?

355
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:47,068
BUT SOME WHAT HE HAS TO

356
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:48,436
APPROVE -- >> Laura: REMEMBER

357
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:50,104
THIS THING WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE

358
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:52,840
BEGUN KIND OF SORT OF WHEN THAT

359
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,042
LIST OF TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY

360
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:57,478
ADVISORS, NATIONAL SECURITY

361
00:11:57,478 --> 00:11:59,147
ADVISORS CAME OUT, CARTER PAGE

362
00:11:59,147 --> 00:11:59,847
AND GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, THEIR

363
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:02,783
NAMES WERE ON IT IN THE SPRING

364
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:03,151
OF 2016.

365
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:05,987
BUT IF THIS GOES BACK TO 2015

366
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:07,889
AGAIN, WHAT WERE THEY WORRIED

367
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:08,189
ABOUT?

368
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:12,360
I MEAN, STRUCK -- THEY WERE

369
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,594
PETRIFIED OF TRUMP.

370
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:17,031
WHO KNOWS, MAYBE THEY THOUGHT HE

371
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:18,799
WAS GOING TO CATCH ON.

372
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:24,338
>> ONE OF THE PAGES IN THE TEXT

373
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:25,106
WAS, POTUS WANTS TO KNOW

374
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:27,575
EVERYTHING WE ARE DOING.

375
00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:29,777
>> CAN WE JUST ARE NEVER THAT WE

376
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:30,478
HAVE HAD A WHOLE SEGMENTS ON

377
00:12:30,478 --> 00:12:32,747
SHOWS LIKE THIS ABOUT THE STRUCK

378
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:35,283
SECRET SOCIETY COME ABOUT STRUCK

379
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:36,584
LOST EMAILS?

380
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:38,052
LET'S TRY TO FIGURE OUT

381
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:39,587
EXACTLY -- I AGREE WE NEED TO

382
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:42,590
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

383
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,391
>> Laura: I'M PUTTING CAVEATS

384
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,593
AIM, AND I AGREE WITH YOU BUT

385
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:46,694
THOSE ARE TECHNICAL ACRONYMS

386
00:12:46,694 --> 00:12:49,797
THAT ARE USED WITHIN THE BUREAU.

387
00:12:49,797 --> 00:12:50,431
THOSE AREN'T LOVE MESSAGES

388
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:52,600
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM.

389
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,768
I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE FASCINATED

390
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:55,269
BY THOSE, BUT THOSE ARE

391
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:56,204
TECHNICAL TERMS.

392
00:12:56,204 --> 00:12:58,606
SO IT SEEMS LIKE, DID YOU GET

393
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:01,008
APPROVAL FOR THESE LURES?

394
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:02,076
AND, WAITING FOR THE ANSWER.

395
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:03,811
>> BUT THERE WERE NO SPIES.

396
00:13:03,811 --> 00:13:05,246
THERE WAS ONE GUY THAT MADE A

397
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:08,749
COUPLE OF APPROACHES TO PEOPLE

398
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:11,752
THAT WERE TARGETED BY CIA AND

399
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:12,053
FBI.

400
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:15,957
>> ONE HOUR PEOPLE HAVE COME OUT

401
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:17,358
WITH ALSO STEPHEN MILLER BEING

402
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:19,026
INVITED TO THAT SAME EVENT.

403
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:20,595
>> PAPADOPOULOS AND THEN THEY

404
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:23,164
REACH OUT TO SAM CLOVIS, AND

405
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:24,599
HERE'S THE THING.

406
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:25,266
IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND

407
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:26,968
THEIR BIG ARTICLE, THEY SAID AT

408
00:13:26,968 --> 00:13:28,402
LEAST ONE PERSON SO THERE IS THE

409
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:31,239
POSSIBILITY THAT THERE WAS MORE

410
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,874
THAN JUST STUFF ON THE HALTER.

411
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:35,977
>> SO IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE

412
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:40,982
TRYING TO GET ALL OF THE

413
00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:41,582
EX-ASCENT NATIONALISTS.

414
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:43,017
STEPHEN MILLER IS REALLY A

415
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:43,551
RUSSIAN PLANT.

416
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,254
BUT AGAIN, THE TIMELINE IS IS

417
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:48,556
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

418
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:49,991
DOCUMENTS, DO WE?

419
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:50,658
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FBI

420
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:53,828
DOCUMENTS FROM THAT TIME.

421
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:55,162
BEFORE JULY 31ST.

422
00:13:55,162 --> 00:13:56,831
THAT'S WHY YOU ARE GRADUALLY

423
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:58,032
GETTING THE TEXT.

424
00:13:58,032 --> 00:13:59,600
>> WE HEARD FROM PAPADOPOULOS

425
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,401
AND OTHERS THAT THE RUSSIANS

426
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,203
WERE TRYING TO GET DIRT ON

427
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:03,537
HILLARY, BUT NOT ONE PERSON IN

428
00:14:03,537 --> 00:14:05,273
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WENT TO THE

429
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:10,044
U.S. AUTHORITIES, NOT ONE.

430
00:14:10,044 --> 00:14:10,478
THAT'S A FACT.

431
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:14,949
>> Laura: DO YOU THINK THIS

432
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:15,683
PAPADOPOULOS -- THIS CHARACTER

433
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:16,984
ACCOMPANIES TROLLING BARS IN

434
00:14:16,984 --> 00:14:20,588
LONDON AND GOING TO TRUMP TOWER

435
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:25,493
AND SAYING, I'M GOING TO SET UP

436
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:27,995
THIS.

437
00:14:27,995 --> 00:00:00,000
>> I THINK WE HAVE LIKE, THE
