>> Neil: WARREN BUFFET
CONSIDERED THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
INVESTOR ON THE PLANET ADMITS
HE'S NOT PERFECT.
ALTHOUGH HE'S MADE BILLIONS FOR
HIS INVESTORS, HE ALSO LAMENTS
REAL MISSING REAL BEAUTIES LIKE
MISSING TECHNOLOGY STOCKS
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
TECHNOLOGY.
I MADE THE WRONG DECISION ON
APPLE AND AMAZON AS HE SAID THIS
PAST WEEKEND.
HE APPARENTLY MADE UP FOR IT ON
APPLE REVEALING HE'S BOUGHT 75
MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S
STOCK IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND
COULD BUY MORE.
DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING ABOUT
AMAZON, BUT HE READILY ADMITTED
TO BEING PUT OFF ON THEIR HIGH
STOCK PRICE.
NOW HE SAYS THAT WAS STUPID AND
SO WAS HE.
IMAGINE THAT?
SINCE HE JUST ESTIMATED AMAZON'S
ABILITY TO DISRUPT RETAIL AND
CLAUDE COMPUTING AT THE SAME
TIME.
WHAT IS REMARKABLE ABOUT HIS
WORDS, BUFFET FELT THE NEED TO
SHARE THEM AT ALL.
NO INVESTOR IN HUMAN HISTORY HAS
COME ANYWHERE CLOSE TO HIS
SUCCESS OR SPOTLIGHTED SO MANY
SUCCESSES.
THERE'S WARREN SCREAMING TO THE
WORLD, I'M NOT INFALLIBLE.
I'VE HAD SOME DOOZIES.
BUFFET LIKES TO REMIND FOLKS
ABOUT THOSE DOOZIES.
THE TIME HE BOND CONOCO PHILLIPS
FOR $2 AND LOST A BUNDLE AND
THEN THERE WAS U.S. AIR.
NEVER MIND THAT HIS HITS HAVE
WALLOPED HIS MISSES.
HE DOESN'T MISS A CHANCE TO SAY
HE'S BEEN HIT AND HASN'T HURT
HIM A BIT.
FOR TWO RUNS.
FIRST, INVESTORS TRUST HIM.
AVERAGE FOLKS ARE ALL HUMAN.
WE'RE ALL HUMAN.
AS HUMAN BEINGS, WE ALL MAKE
MISTAKES.
I LIKE TO THINK WE TOLERATE,
ADMIRE THOSE IN PUBLIC LIFE THAT
ADMIT THEM.
BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO JOHN
KENNEDY'S POLL NUMBERS AFTER THE
BAD BANKS FIASCO.
WHEN THE NEW PRESIDENT COULD
HAVE BLAMED HIS PREDECESSOR FOR
THE INVASION.
BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN POLL
NUMBERS WENT UP AFTER THAT.
SO TIED WITH RONALD REAGAN AFTER
THE IRAN CONTRA AFFAIR.
HE SAID THE MATTER WAS ILL
CONCEIVED AND ALL ON HIM.
FESS UP FROM YOUR MISTAKE.
LEARN FROM THEM.
IT SERVED ABRAHAM LINCOLN WELL
WHEN HE WENT THROUGH UNION
GENERALS LIKE TISSUE PAPER.
HE SAID EVENTUALLY IT GET I'D
RIGHT.
AND HE DID.
AND LEE IACOCCA SAID JAPANESE
CARS WOULD BE MORE RELIABLE THAN
HIS.
SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A TIMELY
MESSAGE.
JUST ASK WARREN BUFFET.
HE'S MADE A PRETTY GOOD FORTUNE
STICKING TO IT, EVEN AS HE HAS
