Aretha Franklin one of the greatest singers this country has ever produced and one of the best-selling musicians of all time died this morning after a battle with pancreatic cancer she was 76 over the course of her career Franklin gave us more than music she gave us gifts so what better way to celebrate those gifts than to bring together two people who knew Aretha Franklin well the Reverend Al Sharpton who was one of her dearest friends and Carole King who co-wrote the Aretha hit that made Obama cry natural woman natural woman she made her name long before she recorded the song natural woman which you co-wrote which I co-wrote with Gerry Goffin who wrote the lyrics and Jerry Wexler who was the producer at Atlantic he came up with the title so that's why you see three names on that in fact you write about this in in your book titled a natural woman you got a whole chapter there about you know Jerry was talking about coming up with a really big hit for a ritha Franklin what would you think well we listen to WM jr. I just started playing a kind of that slow gospel feel and Jerry just started coming out with the lyrics and it was amazing you know when we we made a demo which I laid a record of that song in tapestry a different way but I made the demo how I thought she might sing it not really being able to sing anywhere near like that and we brought the demo to Jerry Wexler at Atlantic and almond erdogan and we heard nothing and we heard nothing we heard nothing and then we get a call and we come into the office and they play us the record that y'all have been listening to all that's amazing blew me away it was like oh my god one of our greatest performances - in terms of singing was singing natural one my most dramatic memory if you want to call that our enduring memory is she sang at the White House in the last year yep of all President Obama for jazz night and I remember I got a page and I got to the white house and it was saying to somebody we're going through and that they were having it out in the White House lawn under a tent and I saw will who traveled with Miss Franklin and I said where's the Queen he said and he did like this and he brought me the back and she was in a room getting a head done and she looked at me he said red Mile too big it don't get no better than that griefer getting a head done in the White House with me now I didn't know whether to laugh or cry cause in a moment but her and the president really loved 50 years of American history her performance her performing life was 50 years of American history he talked to me about her influence on on music on contemporary music well I would say first of all I am a you know a white Jewish girl was a white Jewish girl and totally you know influenced by her her piano playing style which by the way a terrible act at the Kennedy Center Honors thing one of the first things that December of 2015 right she sang natural woman for you she sang it for me and later I read an article in which she actually said I was singing it for her but it sure felt like that and I was just oh my god because the first thing she did which she doesn't usually do in in her later years she came out on that stage and she sat down at the piano and started to play and I turned to my daughter who was sitting behind me I said all moaning rain so nice and from there it was just you know she took me high but but you know she was she was a kind of a revolution of her own her talent to be sure a black woman doing her own thing and you know leading others around so in the producted all business indeed and and as I said you know I was I was a young white Jewish woman but I interacted in my business you know we didn't think very much about how you know it's a call or whatever we just all whatever it took to get this to happen and so you know my interaction with her was just inspiration I took so much inspiration and so the inspiration to be from her and all of these things she did but she has a number of songs respect and think which are really anthems particularly for for women their feminist anthems this woman was a trailblazer in a lot of ways wherever now I mean in the different kinds of music she did by the way she succeeded at opera as well but but she really she wrote both wrote inspirationally and behaved inspiration she behaved as she wrote she would certainly affirmed women feminism way before it was popular and she brought the sound of the black church mainstream people that she never lost that kind of Church kind of fields of music and if you'd ever go see her perform she would do gospel songs and do a joy shout if it was in the White House that was at the Apollo Theater that was a real struggle at the time particularly for African American performers right because they were they were pigeon holed right they if you were an R&B singer it was next to impossible even if you were topping the charts to to move over seamlessly and I think that she never got the credit for that but she never lost her authenticity I think that's where everybody loved her no matter what race because she was who she was and she would sing from her you could you could watch other performers you could feel a wreath it was something about Aretha that got down into the bottom of your soul I'm just reading from a chapter 27 of your book Carol where Jerry you were talking to him about recording about writing natural woman and you said oh my god he wants us to write for Aretha I think we can do it of course we can yeah I think I've already got an idea you you did you know at the time when you were doing this with the wreath of Franklin that this was going to be one of many but but a song that everybody no matter how old you are today knows there's no no young child who's listen to music who doesn't won't recognize natural woman I did not.we I don't think Jerry Judy that we were just you know we just had a job to do we just sat down to do our job but it was a little intimidating and sure like I said I made demo and I don't have the range that she has I don't have that gospel singing background and yet somehow sometimes sometimes we songwriters or performance and you can see this in Aretha we are the instruments and so I wasn't conscious of any of that all I did was like sit down with Jerry the collaboration worked as it often does with songwriters and what came out she lifted to the next level but we were all instruments in bringing this song to people around the world and so the fact that it's popular I think that's that's that an Aretha I know would say you know she felt like an instrument she knew she was an instrument it is it is I don't know if it's clear to everybody Reverend Al what influence Aretha Franklin has had on their lives because for 50 years of performing so much of what we think of as music he's because of Aretha Franklin absolutely and I think that we've had a lot of Legends we've had a lot of mega stars and superstars well we've only had one queen and her name is Aretha Franklin and she's got soul and she's a natural woman that is a great way remember Aretha Franklin Carole King Reverend L thank you both thank you hey there I'm Chris
