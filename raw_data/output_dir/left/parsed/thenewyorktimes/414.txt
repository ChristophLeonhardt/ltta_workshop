I guess I saw this at first as
a kind of poker game.
I had been taking pictures with
the phone like Solitaire
and suddenly I had someone, a
partner to play this card game with.
Yeah, I think it's incredible how little 
we knew about each other
when we started and how much 
we know about each other now.
It was very thrilling for me
because first I never knew when
you would post and my phone 
would just kind of indicate
when you had sent the picture 
and wherever I was, I would
kind of exit and secretly
look at the photograph.
I think the adventure was 
such a big part of it,
just to not know what the response 
is going to be or is it,
are we picking up a new thread? 
Or are we still building upon the previous one?
Never had dead ends to the 
conversation, never seemed to lag orâ€“
there was always a kind of new
avenue with each picture,
a continuation and the opening
of something new.
And I thought it was 
interesting too because you
know pregnancy is 
often cute babies
and tire tracks or you know
bunnies and kittens and
we have a lot of violence in the 
photos actually and a lot of kind of unease.
In a way that does go 
hand-in-hand with what was
happening in the country.
Yeah, I mean... it was definitely
I remember us telling each other
the following day that something was
really missing.
We had gotten really used to this
banter back and forth and
you know, we work so solitary so often
that to be able to get to do this is such a luxury.
So we've already started our second segment. 
To be continued, to be continued.
