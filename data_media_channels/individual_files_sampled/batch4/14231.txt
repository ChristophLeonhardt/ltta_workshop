Ezra Levin for the rebel dot media I'm standing on the Temple Mount it's called the Temple Mount because that's where the Jewish temple was until it was destroyed in 70 AD there's a Muslim tradition to build mosques on top of the holy sites of other religions and thus you have just behind me to my right you can see some of the gray Dome of the al-aqsa mosque built centuries after the Jewish temple and behind me the glorious Dome of the rock with its iconic golden roof this vast plaza on the top of the temple it's enormous and then goes it's it's staggeringly huge you could probably have a hundred thousand people or more up here and you can imagine what it was like back in the days of the Jewish temple when the entire Jewish people would come those days are long gone the Jews reconquered this part of Jerusalem in 1967 but not quite because to this day the Islamic holy trust the walk of its called still is in charge of who comes and goes up here on the Temple Mount it's true the only armed security are Israelis but the ones who set the rules for who can pray when and where how you can dress who gets access or not that is the Muslim religious authority directed by the PLM it's incredible the deference to Islam you could even say it's a little bit of a mini apartheid state we're up here on the Temple Mount Muslims have full access and Jews still don't that said I'll tell you one thing it's nice to be in the capital city of the State of Israel for the rebel not media I'm answering the fans you want to see all our videos from Israel got a rebel Israel calm I'll tell you one thing you won't give this point of view anywhere else you
