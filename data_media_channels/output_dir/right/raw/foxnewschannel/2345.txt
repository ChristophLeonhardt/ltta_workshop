00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:03,196
REPUBLICAN REPORT ON WHETHER HIS

2
00:00:03,196 --> 00:00:06,099
CAMPAIGN COLLUDED WITH RUSSIA TO

3
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,156
WIN THE ELECTION.

4
00:00:08,156 --> 00:00:09,234
JOHN ROBERTS COVERING IT ALL.

5
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:11,735
>> IT LOOKED LIKE A WATERSHED

6
00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:12,305
MOMENT.

7
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:16,165
THE LEADERS OF NORTH KOREA AND

8
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:17,817
SOUTH KOREA SMILING AND LAUGHING

9
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:21,248
AND EMBASING.

10
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,416
-- EMBRACING.

11
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,944
COULD THEN JUST ANOTHER NORTH

12
00:00:24,944 --> 00:00:26,219
KOREA DECEPTION?

13
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:27,947
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP BEGAN HIS DAY

14
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:30,228
WITH THE U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM.

15
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:32,081
A SEGUE TO TALK ABOUT THE

16
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:33,734
POTENTIAL BREAK THROUGH ON NORTH

17
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:34,034
KOREA.

18
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,988
>> I WANT TO EXPRESS MY HOPE

19
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:38,087
THAT ALL OF THE PEOPLE FROM

20
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:40,233
NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA CAN

21
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:41,935
LIVE IN HARMONY, PROSPERITY AND

22
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:42,241
PEACE.

23
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:44,393
IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD HAPPEN.

24
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:47,348
>> BUT THE U.S. HEARD TALK OF

25
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,968
CONCESSIONS BEFORE ONLY TO GET

26
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:49,995
PLAYED BY NORTH KOREA.

27
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:51,399
MEETING WITH ANGELA MERKEL

28
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,302
TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THIS

29
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:56,655
TIME FEELS DIFFERENT.

30
00:00:56,805 --> 00:01:00,107
IT'S NEVER GONE THIS FAR.

31
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:02,478
I DON'T THINK IT'S EVER HAD THIS

32
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:04,012
ENTHUSIASM FOR THEM WANTING TO

33
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:06,059
MAKE A DEAL.

34
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:07,266
THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN

35
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:08,161
PLAYED LIKE A FIDDLE.

36
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,763
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF

37
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:10,069
LEADER.

38
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,464
WE WON'T BE PLAYED.

39
00:01:11,464 --> 00:01:11,765
OKAY.

40
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:13,466
WE WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE A DEAL.

41
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:14,526
IF WE DON'T, THAT'S FINE.

42
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:15,983
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THE

43
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:18,277
LIST OF POSSIBLE LOCATIONS FOR A

44
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:20,273
SUMMIT HAS BEEN NARROWED DOWN TO

45
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:20,679
TWO.

46
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:22,882
THE PRESIDENT MAKING IT CLEAR

47
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:26,535
UNTIL HE SEES CONCRETE ACTIONS

48
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:28,337
FROM KIM, SANCTIONS WILL REMAIN.

49
00:01:28,337 --> 00:01:30,842
>> WE WON'T REPEAT THE MISTAKE

50
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:34,042
OF PAST ADMINISTRATIONS.

51
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:36,146
MAXIMUM PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE

52
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:37,490
UNTIL DENUCLEARIZATION OCCURS.

53
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,849
>> IN THE OVAL OFFICE, PRESIDENT

54
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,094
TRUMP WEIGHING IN TODAY ON THE

55
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:43,028
FINAL REPUBLICAN REPORT FROM THE

56
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:45,099
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.

57
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:46,453
MAJOR FINDING:

58
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:48,409
NONE OF THE INTERVIEWED

59
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,260
WITNESSES PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF

60
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,730
COLLUSION OR CONSPIRACY BETWEEN

61
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,412
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE

62
00:01:54,412 --> 00:01:55,814
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.

63
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:57,866
>> THE REPORT WAS VERY POWERFUL

64
00:01:57,866 --> 00:01:59,112
AND STRONG.

65
00:01:59,112 --> 00:02:01,669
NO COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP

66
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:03,316
CAMPAIGN AND THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE.

67
00:02:03,316 --> 00:02:06,119
AS I SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE, I

68
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,094
SAID THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.

69
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,777
WE SHOULD GET ON WITH OUR LIVES

70
00:02:08,777 --> 00:02:10,479
AND GET ON WITH A LOT OF THINGS.

71
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,182
>> DEMOCRATS CALLED IT A RUSHED

72
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:14,402
JOB ONLY MEANT TO DEFLECT

73
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:17,330
ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE TRUMP

74
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:17,686
CAMPAIGN.

75
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:21,235
>> THAT'S A KINDERGARTEN REPORT.

76
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:24,592
>> THE REPORT CITED ILL-ADVISED

77
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:27,246
CONTACT WITH WIKI LEAKS BY TRUMP

78
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:30,177
ASSOCIATES AND HIGHLIGHTED THE

79
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:38,251
JUNE 6th MEETING DONALD TRUMP

80
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:45,158
WITH A GOVERNMENT INFORMANT FOR

81
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:45,514
RUSSIAIA.

82
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:52,120
>> WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OF HER

83
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,322
CONTACTS WITHIN THE RUSSIA

84
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:55,824
GOVERNMENT THIS IS SOMEONE

85
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:58,375
WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE

86
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:58,728
KREMLIN.

87
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:02,375
>> THE PRESIDENT'S MEETING WITH

88
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:07,786
ANGELA MERKEL AVOIDED

89
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:09,136
UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENTS.

90
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:11,592
MERKEL INDICATED THAT GERMANY IS

91
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,715
OPENED TO REDUCING ITS TRADE

92
00:03:14,715 --> 00:03:16,646
SURPLUS AND THE U.S. AND

93
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:17,969
ACKNOWLEDGING THE IRAN NUCLEAR

94
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,998
DEAL IS NOT PERFECT.

95
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:22,550
MORE ACTIONS NEEDED.

96
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,722
>> THIS AGREEMENT IS ANYTHING

97
00:03:24,722 --> 00:03:25,801
BUT PERFECT.

98
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:28,301
IT'S ONE PIECE OF THE MOSAIC, A

99
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,964
BUILDING BLOCK TO BUILD-UP THIS

100
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:30,309
STRUCTURE.

101
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:31,309
>> THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT

102
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:32,705
RESIST TAKING ANOTHER SHOT AT

103
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,113
JAMES COMEY.

104
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,614
ZEROING IN ON HIS INTERVIEW WITH

105
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:36,566
BRET BAIER LAST NIGHT.

106
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:41,469
>> DID YOU LEAK OTHER THINGS?

107
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:41,815
>> YES.

108
00:03:41,815 --> 00:03:43,917
I DON'T CONSIDER WHAT I DID A

109
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:44,217
LEAK.

110
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:46,319
I TOLD HIM ABOUT AN UNCLASSIFIED

111
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,377
CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT.

112
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:52,633
>> YOU SAID I DON'T DO SNEAKY

113
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,731
THINGS OR DO WEASEL MOVES.

114
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,484
WE COULD ARGUE WHAT A LEAK IS

115
00:03:57,484 --> 00:03:59,083
BUT THAT'S A LEAK.

116
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,934
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED JAMES

117
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:03,690
COMEY CAN'T DEFINE WHAT A LEAK

118
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,388
IS.

119
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:07,040
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE

120
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,826
DID OR HOW SERIOUS IT IS.

121
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:09,999
LIEED TO COVER IT UP.

122
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,646
HE IS EITHER VERY SICK OR VERY

123
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:13,947
DUMB.

124
00:04:13,947 --> 00:04:18,406
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL

125
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:21,333
ATTORNEY MICHAEL COHEN WON A

126
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,255
VICTORY TODAY.

00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:25,838
A 90 DELAY IN THE STORMY DANIELS

128
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:27,468
CIVIL SUIT.
