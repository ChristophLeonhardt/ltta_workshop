just when it might have seemed that Robert Muller's hunt for collusion was running out of steam out of the woodwork comes a juicy new clue a nod of approval from Donald Trump to a potential meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin back in 2016 that's according to the lawyers of former Trump campaign aide George papadopolis one of Muller's main targets while some in the room rebuffed George's offer mr. Trump nodded with approval the document came as a hopeful defense for Papadopoulos who admitted to lying to the FBI during the meddling investigation the picture Papadopoulos 'as lawyers are painting though describes anything but a criminal with them saying that his motives were not sinister as the government suggests they say he was just trying to show loyalty to his master the lengthy document aside though Trump's nod might help to revive the investigation which some say has become frustrating as hell I am sure there will be people at the end of this who feel that we came to conclusion that they V mentally disagree with I know that from a committees integrity standpoint we've got to prove what we find and if you can't prove it then we can't make the claim oh that might be frustrating especially when just days ago other hopes for reviving the investigation were derailed as the probe into Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen rages on Cohen's attorney promised a bombshell of information baiting the mainstream media he told CNN that Cohen had information about DNC hacking and Don Junior's infamous meeting with the Russians sources with knowledge tell myself and Carl that Michael Cohen claims that then candidate Donald Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower crucially these sources tell us that Cohen is willing to make that assertion to the special counsel Robert Muller the reporting of this story got mixed up so Michael Cohen does not have information that President Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting with the Russians beforehand or you know the not but suddenly he backtracked on the in Sydney arey claim expressing regret and saying he should have been more clear I should have been more clear including with you that I could not independently confirm what happened I regret my era and sure the investigation was able to get Cohen to admit to some crimes of tax and bank fraud but then again that doesn't have much to deal with Russia does it here's an odd American political cartoonist and columnist at Ted roll thinks Trump's enemies are scrambling to pin anything detrimental to him this is what we call in u.s. politics a smear it's guilt by association you say it was used a lot during the McCarthy era hey you attended a communist meeting so you know what's with that I mean you know attending a communist meeting doesn't make you a communist talking to Vladimir Putin doesn't mean that you're the servant of Vladimir Putin and wanting warmer relations with Russia doesn't make you a traitor but the implication is that perhaps it does obviously the effort here as it is here and as it has been from the very beginning to try to imply that President Trump received or was interested in receiving help from President Putin and Russian intelligence to hack the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign and so on in order to provide campaign intelligence to to the Trump campaign and that's been the effort you
