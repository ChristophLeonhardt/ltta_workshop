Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is a new generation in the Saudi royal family he's going to be the first of the next generation to rule Saudi Arabia he's very young and he has some different ideas about where Saudi Arabia should go so what he's doing here is he's looking to attract businesses to open in Saudi Arabia to bring jobs to bring an entrepreneurial spirit and to bring some dynamic activity to the kingdom Donald Trump being the president of the United States the crown prince is really concerned about Iran that's really their primary geopolitical issue right now so his meeting with the president is designed to express Saudi policy towards Iran they would like the president to really take a hard stance on Iran on Iran's activities particularly in Yemen as that threatens Saudi Arabia directly and they would also like Donald Trump to take a very tough position on the Iran nuclear deal they're very concerned about Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon and they've stated that if Iran acquires or it looks like it's going to acquire a nuclear weapon they will do so as well one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman is very interested in doing is he's interested in setting up tech hubs essentially in Saudi Arabia he announced this great new city called neo that they would like to open on the Red Sea to be really a Innovation Centre in the Middle East and so his meeting with Bill Gates is probably designed to further those goals so Jeff Bezos being CEO of Amazon one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudis are looking to do is they're really looking to establish Saudi Arabia as a logistics hub they see its orientation and its location in the Middle East is very valuable to that and one of those things is bringing in data centers apparently the Middle East is really bereft of cloud computing and data centers and so they are in talks with Amazon to bring a data center to the Red Sea coast and I wouldn't be surprised if some sort of deal is announced very soon Oprah has a media empire and the king and the royal family has recently decided that Saudi Arabia will open movie theaters around the country this is a new development most of the movie theaters closed in the late 70s and now they want to open movie theaters there'll be some interesting restrictions some of them might have separate seating for men and women but he's looking to really get Saudi Arabia's arts and cultural and entertainment scene jump-started so I see his meeting with Oprah as part of that initiative for many many years the Saudi economy has largely been dependent on the sale of oil and on oil revenues and his goal is to diversify the economy and to create a much more dynamic place that is not dependent on oil revenues from the National Oil Company Aramco
