“This immigration debate will
have a level playing field
and an amendment
process that is fair
to all sides.”
That was the promise
made by Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell.
It was enough for
Senate Democrats
to agree to a funding deal.
And the Democrats are
selling that promise
made by McConnell as a win.
“We got a firm
commitment on the floor
before the entire country.”
“I was very pleased that we have
a commitment from the majority
leader.”
“We’ve tried for
four years to get
a vote on DACA protections
and have had no luck.
We’re going to get one now.”
The bill doesn’t
contain protections
for the so-called Dreamers,
young undocumented immigrants
who face threat of deportation.
That was a major sticking
point for the Democrats.
“This will be called
the Trump shutdown.”
But just three days
later, Senator Schumer
agreed to end the government
shutdown without a firm path
to a solution on DACA.
“In a few hours, the
government will reopen.
We have a lot to do.”
Now, it seems the
fate of the Dreamers
rests in the Republicans’ hands.
Immigrants rights activists
are urging their supporters
to protest what they’ve labeled
the #SchumerSellout.
But some Democrats insist
it’s on Senator McConnell
to keep his promise, not them.
“The proof will be whether
he actually does it.
He’s made so many promises
even to his own members
that he has not honored, so he
has a reputation now of being
somebody you can’t count on.”
While the blame game
continues, the stage
is set for a showdown.
The fate of hundreds of
thousands of young immigrants
is hanging in the balance.
