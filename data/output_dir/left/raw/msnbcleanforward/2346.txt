00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,273
DEAN, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR. ALEXI, IT’S BEEN POINTED OUT FOR

8
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:17,908
ALEXI, IT’S BEEN POINTED OUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME THAT IF THE

9
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,276
A VERY LONG TIME THAT IF THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO MAKE A

10
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,444
PRESIDENT WANTED TO MAKE A CHANGE, HE COULD GET SOMEONE AND

11
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,345
CHANGE, HE COULD GET SOMEONE AND IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS WHO CAN DO

12
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,780
IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS WHO CAN DO ALL THE THINGS THAT SCOTT PRUITT

13
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,448
ALL THE THINGS THAT SCOTT PRUITT WAS DOING IN TERMS OF

14
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:29,686
WAS DOING IN TERMS OF DISMANTLING REGULATIONS AT THE E

15
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,388
DISMANTLING REGULATIONS AT THE E EPA AND NOT HAVE THIS AS A

16
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:31,788
EPA AND NOT HAVE THIS AS A DISTRACTION.

17
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,990
DISTRACTION. SO AGAIN I GO TO THE QUESTION

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,757
SO AGAIN I GO TO THE QUESTION WHY NOW?

19
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,193
WHY NOW? IS IT BECAUSE HE WAS MAKING

20
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,227
IS IT BECAUSE HE WAS MAKING DONALD TRUMP LOOK BAD?

21
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,162
DONALD TRUMP LOOK BAD? IS IT BECAUSE THERE’S A NEW

22
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:39,997
IS IT BECAUSE THERE’S A NEW COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR?

23
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,132
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR? IS THE PRESSURE FINALLY

24
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:42,499
IS THE PRESSURE FINALLY BUILDING?

25
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,233
BUILDING? BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY

26
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:44,701
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE TREY GOWDY WHO HAS BEEN SO

27
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,503
LIKE TREY GOWDY WHO HAS BEEN SO MUCH IN THE PRESIDENT’S POCKET

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,277
THIS GUY, IT JUST BECAME UNTENABLE?

32
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,078
UNTENABLE? >> WELL, I THINK IF WE LOOK TO

33
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,113
>> WELL, I THINK IF WE LOOK TO SCOTT PRUITT’S RESIGNATION LATER

34
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,082
SCOTT PRUITT’S RESIGNATION LATER AND GET PAST THE SNARK IN THERE

35
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,117
AND GET PAST THE SNARK IN THERE WHERE HE’S BLAMING THE MEDIA

36
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,552
WHERE HE’S BLAMING THE MEDIA SAYING THE MEDIA HAS BEEN

37
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,886
SAYING THE MEDIA HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY ATTACKING HIM, THAT

38
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,822
UNFAIRLY ATTACKING HIM, THAT SORT OF SIGNALS PERHAPS WHY NOW.

39
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,357
SORT OF SIGNALS PERHAPS WHY NOW. MAYBE SCOTT PRUITT AND THE

40
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,125
MAYBE SCOTT PRUITT AND THE PRESIDENT HAVE SEEN THAT THEY

41
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,793
PRESIDENT HAVE SEEN THAT THEY THINK THE MEDIA IS DOING TOO

42
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,629
THINK THE MEDIA IS DOING TOO GOOD OF A JOB BY REPORTING ON

43
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:13,096
GOOD OF A JOB BY REPORTING ON THESE SCANDALS.

44
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,832
THESE SCANDALS. WE CAN LOOK BACK TO FEBRUARY OF

45
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,233
WE CAN LOOK BACK TO FEBRUARY OF 2017 WHEN SCOTT PRUITT WAS GOING

46
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,034
2017 WHEN SCOTT PRUITT WAS GOING THROUGH HIS CONFIRMATION HEARING

47
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,769
THROUGH HIS CONFIRMATION HEARING AND DEMOCRATS ON THE HILL WERE

48
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,904
AND DEMOCRATS ON THE HILL WERE SAYING -- SENATOR WHITEHOUSE WAS

49
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,738
SAYING -- SENATOR WHITEHOUSE WAS SAYING MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS ARE

50
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:25,342
SAYING MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS ARE GOING TO RUE THE DAY WHEN THEY

51
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:26,043
GOING TO RUE THE DAY WHEN THEY JAMMED THROUGH THIS NOMINATION

52
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,044
JAMMED THROUGH THIS NOMINATION OF SCOTT PRUITT BECAUSE THEY HAD

53
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:27,912
OF SCOTT PRUITT BECAUSE THEY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT HIS CONNECTIONS

54
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,314
CONCERNS ABOUT HIS CONNECTIONS TO OIL COMPANIES BACK THEN.

55
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:30,915
TO OIL COMPANIES BACK THEN. THEY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT

56
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:31,749
THEY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT POTENTIAL CONTROVERSIES THAT

57
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:33,150
POTENTIAL CONTROVERSIES THAT HADN’T COME UP BACK THEN AND

58
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,051
HADN’T COME UP BACK THEN AND THAT WAS LAST FEBRUARY.

59
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,319
THAT WAS LAST FEBRUARY. I THINK NOW WE’RE SORT OF SEEING

00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,154
I THINK NOW WE’RE SORT OF SEEING THE TROUBLING, THE MOUNTING

61

00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,260
DISTRACTION FOR THE PRESIDENT BUT A DISTRACTION FOR ALL THE

00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:43,961
BUT A DISTRACTION FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT THE EPA WAS MOVING

67
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,664
THINGS THAT THE EPA WAS MOVING FORWARD ON THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

68
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:47,131
FORWARD ON THAT THE PRESIDENT IS HAPPY ABOUT.

69
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:50,034
HAPPY ABOUT. AS YOU MENTIONED, HE’LL BE ABLE

70
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:51,335
AS YOU MENTIONED, HE’LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH THE NEXT MAN

71
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,871
TO DO THAT WITH THE NEXT MAN WITHOUT ALL OF THESE

72
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:54,972

HE SAYS IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SEE SERVING YOU IN THIS ROLE

HE’S DAMAGED THIS COUNTRY ENORMOUSLY.

HIS DISREGARD FOR THE LAW, AS TRUMP IS AS WELL.

137

TRUMP IS AS WELL. SO I THINK TRUMP -- I THINK WHAT

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,971
SO I THINK TRUMP -- I THINK WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IS THAT HE

139
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:36,274
REALLY HAPPENED IS THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED IN.

140
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:38,143
SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED IN. IN A NORMAL ADMINISTRATION HE

141

IN A NORMAL ADMINISTRATION HE WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN APPOINTED.

142
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:41,246
WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN APPOINTED. BUT EVEN IN THIS ADMINISTRATION

143
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:43,782
BUT EVEN IN THIS ADMINISTRATION HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED MONTHS

SUPREME COURT. LET’S START WITH THE MIDTERM

LET’S START WITH THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

166
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:14,613
ELECTIONS. WE CAN’T BE DEALING WITH THIS.

167
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:17,249
WE CAN’T BE DEALING WITH THIS. I WONDERING IF THIS IS ANYTHING

168
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,482
I WONDERING IF THIS IS ANYTHING INDICATIVE OF THE WAY THE WHITE

169
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:20,619
INDICATIVE OF THE WAY THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT

170
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:21,019
HOUSE IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THINGS.

171
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,188
THINGS. YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE HAD ETHICAL

172
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,090
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE HAD ETHICAL QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT RYAN

173
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,193
QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT RYAN ZINKE, ABOUT BEN CARLSON.

174
00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:29,094
ZINKE, ABOUT BEN CARLSON. YOU COULD ALSO ARGUE THAT

175
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:30,195
YOU COULD ALSO ARGUE THAT COMPARED TO SCOTT PRUITT THEY

176
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:33,098
COMPARED TO SCOTT PRUITT THEY WERE AMATEUR HOUR, BUT DOES THIS

177
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:34,232
WERE AMATEUR HOUR, BUT DOES THIS BODE FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAT

178
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:35,234
BODE FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE?

179
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:36,235
MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE? >> I THINK THAT WOULD BE A

180
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:37,837
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE A SIGNAL OF BILL SHINE HAVING AN

181
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,939
SIGNAL OF BILL SHINE HAVING AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF POWER ON I

182
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,407
IMMENSE AMOUNT OF POWER ON I GUESS HIS FIRST OFFICIAL DAY,

183
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,308
GUESS HIS FIRST OFFICIAL DAY, MAYBE HIS FOURTH OFFICIAL DAY

184
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:43,209
MAYBE HIS FOURTH OFFICIAL DAY THIS WEEK.

185
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:45,544
THIS WEEK. I WOULDN’T PUT IT PAST HIM AND

186
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:46,745
I WOULDN’T PUT IT PAST HIM AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE THAT

187
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:47,046
THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

188
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,114
HAPPEN. I THINK THE MIDTERM ELECTION

189
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:49,448
I THINK THE MIDTERM ELECTION ANGINA ’EM IS SIGNIFICANT.

190
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:51,150
ANGINA ’EM IS SIGNIFICANT. GOVERNOR HOWARD DEAN JUST

191
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,852
GOVERNOR HOWARD DEAN JUST MENTIONED THIS A LITTLE BIT.

192
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:54,287
MENTIONED THIS A LITTLE BIT. IF DEMOCRATS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE

193
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,222
IF DEMOCRATS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE OR THE SENATE, EITHER CHAMBER OF

194
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:57,723
OR THE SENATE, EITHER CHAMBER OF CONGRESS, IT WILL BE A LOT

195
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:59,225
CONGRESS, IT WILL BE A LOT HARDER FOR THE HEAD OF THE EPA

196
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:01,060
HARDER FOR THE HEAD OF THE EPA TO MOVE FORWARD ON DISMANTLING

197
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:02,161
TO MOVE FORWARD ON DISMANTLING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION’S

198
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:03,129
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION’S ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA BECAUSE

199
00:05:03,172 --> 00:05:04,964
ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA BECAUSE THERE WILL BE MORE CONGRESSIONAL

200
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:06,232
THERE WILL BE MORE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT FROM DEMOCRATS.

201
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:07,566
OVERSIGHT FROM DEMOCRATS. THERE ARE MOUNTING CONTROVERSIES

202
00:05:07,577 --> 00:05:08,568
THERE ARE MOUNTING CONTROVERSIES HAPPENING WITHIN THE

203
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:09,468
HAPPENING WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION FROM THE TOP DOWN

204
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:10,970
ADMINISTRATION FROM THE TOP DOWN THAT ARE EASILY BECOMING A

205
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,138
THAT ARE EASILY BECOMING A DISTRACTION AHEAD OF THE

206
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:12,772
DISTRACTION AHEAD OF THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.

207
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:14,740
NOVEMBER ELECTION. SCOTT PRUITT IS MAYBE VIEWED,

208
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:15,741
SCOTT PRUITT IS MAYBE VIEWED, NOW WE’RE SAYING TODAY, AS

209
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:17,243
NOW WE’RE SAYING TODAY, AS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT WORTH IT,

210
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:18,578
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT WORTH IT, A DISTRACTION THAT IS NOT WORTH

211
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:19,979
A DISTRACTION THAT IS NOT WORTH IT WHEN REPUBLICANS ARE HEADING

212
00:05:19,989 --> 00:05:20,980
IT WHEN REPUBLICANS ARE HEADING INTO THIS VERY COMPETITIVE

213
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,381
INTO THIS VERY COMPETITIVE ELECTION IN JUST A FEW WEEKS.

214
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:24,250
ELECTION IN JUST A FEW WEEKS. >> HOWARD, DOES IT TAKE, THOUGH,

215
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,285
>> HOWARD, DOES IT TAKE, THOUGH, SOMETHING AWAY FROM THE

216
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:26,685
SOMETHING AWAY FROM THE DEMOCRATS?

217
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:27,987
DEMOCRATS? ARE REPUBLICANS BREATHING A SIGH

218
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:29,388
ARE REPUBLICANS BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF?

219
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,090
OF RELIEF? THEY DIDN’T WANT TO HAVE TO KEEP

220
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:32,191
THEY DIDN’T WANT TO HAVE TO KEEP ANSWERING QUESTIONS ON THE

221
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:33,125
ANSWERING QUESTIONS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL ABOUT THE

222
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:34,193
CAMPAIGN TRAIL ABOUT THE PRESIDENT’S PROMISE TO DRAIN THE

223
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:34,493
PRESIDENT’S PROMISE TO DRAIN THE SWAMP?

224
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:36,229
SWAMP? >> ANYBODY WHO THINKS THAT SCOTT

225
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:38,464
>> ANYBODY WHO THINKS THAT SCOTT PRUITT IS NOT GOING TO PLAY A

226
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:39,299
PRUITT IS NOT GOING TO PLAY A PROMINENT ROLE IN ADS IN

227
00:05:39,342 --> 00:05:40,467
PROMINENT ROLE IN ADS IN NOVEMBER IS VERY MISTAKEN.

228
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,203
NOVEMBER IS VERY MISTAKEN. YOU’LL SEE ZINKE, YOU’LL SEE

229
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:45,371
YOU’LL SEE ZINKE, YOU’LL SEE PRUITT, THERE WILL BE A WHOLE

230
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:46,306
PRUITT, THERE WILL BE A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE.

231
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,274
LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU’LL SEE BILL SHINE.

232
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:48,775
YOU’LL SEE BILL SHINE. THAT’S THE MOST AMAZING THING TO

233
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:49,008
THAT’S THE MOST AMAZING THING TO ME.

234
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:51,077
ME. IF THE THEORY SHINE DID THIS,

235
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,312
IF THE THEORY SHINE DID THIS, SHINE GOES INTO THE WHITE HOUSE

236
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:53,713
SHINE GOES INTO THE WHITE HOUSE WITH ETHICS PROBLEMS BECAUSE HE

237
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:56,082
WITH ETHICS PROBLEMS BECAUSE HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE PAYOFFS AT

238
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,319
WAS INVOLVED IN THE PAYOFFS AT FOX NEWS FOR THE SEXUAL ASSAULT

239
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:00,787
FOX NEWS FOR THE SEXUAL ASSAULT STUFF.

240
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,388
STUFF. SO, LOOK, TRUMP HIRES PEOPLE

241
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:02,889
SO, LOOK, TRUMP HIRES PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF.

242
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:05,725
LIKE HIMSELF. THIS IS A SCANDAL-RIDDEN

243
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:07,594
THIS IS A SCANDAL-RIDDEN ORGANIZATION.

244
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:08,428
ORGANIZATION. AS I ONCE SAID IT BASICALLY IS

245
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:10,230
AS I ONCE SAID IT BASICALLY IS AN ORGANIZED CRIME RING RUN OUT

246
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,730
AN ORGANIZED CRIME RING RUN OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

247
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:11,598
OF THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT’S WHAT IT IS AND THAT’S

248
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:12,599
THAT’S WHAT IT IS AND THAT’S WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO SEE.

249
00:06:12,609 --> 00:06:14,334
WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO SEE. SCOTT PRUITT IS NOT GOING AWAY

250
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:15,735
SCOTT PRUITT IS NOT GOING AWAY AS FAR AS THE DEMOCRATS ARE

251
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:16,102
AS FAR AS THE DEMOCRATS ARE CONCERNED.

252
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:18,738
CONCERNED. HE’LL BE WITH US UNTIL ELECTION

253
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:19,038
HE’LL BE WITH US UNTIL ELECTION DAY.

254
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:20,307
DAY. >> I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHAT

255
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:22,208
>> I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS DO ABOUT THIS

256
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:23,409
DO THE DEMOCRATS DO ABOUT THIS BESIDES RUN ADS ON IT?

257
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,911
BESIDES RUN ADS ON IT? IS IT REALLY SOMETHING THAT’S

258
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:28,548
IS IT REALLY SOMETHING THAT’S GOING TO HAVE ANY KIND OF REAL

259
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:28,949
GOING TO HAVE ANY KIND OF REAL IMPLICATIONS?

260
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:33,620
IMPLICATIONS? OR ARE PEOPLE JUST SORT OF

261
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:35,421
OR ARE PEOPLE JUST SORT OF SLUGGING ANDSHRUG

262
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:37,357
SLUGGING ANDSHRUG SHRUGING AND SAYING, YEAH, YOU

263
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:38,625
SHRUGING AND SAYING, YEAH, YOU REPLACE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO

264
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:39,659
REPLACE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO DISMANTLE EVERYTHING THE OBAMA

265
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:40,360
DISMANTLE EVERYTHING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID WITH THE

266
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,229
ADMINISTRATION DID WITH THE ENVIRONMENT AND YOU REPLACE IT

267
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,330
ENVIRONMENT AND YOU REPLACE IT AND LET’S SAY THEY KEEP THE

268
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,533
AND LET’S SAY THEY KEEP THE DEPUTY IN, HE’S GOT 200 DAYS

269
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:47,467
DEPUTY IN, HE’S GOT 200 DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD HAVE TO BE

270
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:48,568
BEFORE HE WOULD HAVE TO BE FORMALLY NOMINATED.

271
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:50,570
FORMALLY NOMINATED. EVEN IF HE DIDN’T MAKE IT

272
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:51,538
EVEN IF HE DIDN’T MAKE IT THROUGH HE COULD STAY ANOTHER

273
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:52,172
THROUGH HE COULD STAY ANOTHER 210 DAYS.

274
00:06:52,182 --> 00:06:53,373
210 DAYS. THE PRESIDENT CAN KEEP THIS

275
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:54,507
THE PRESIDENT CAN KEEP THIS GOING WELL PAST.

276
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:56,943
GOING WELL PAST. AND SO IS IT REALLY A VICTORY

277
00:06:56,954 --> 00:06:58,345
AND SO IS IT REALLY A VICTORY FOR DEMOCRATS WHEN YOU HAVE

278
00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:00,747
FOR DEMOCRATS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS ARGUABLY AT

279
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:03,483
SOMEBODY WHO IS ARGUABLY AT LEAST AS BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

280
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:06,419
LEAST AS BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AS SCOTT PRUITT WAS, AND SOME

281
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:07,854
AS SCOTT PRUITT WAS, AND SOME PEOPLE MIGHT ARGUE SOMEBODY WHO

282
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:09,890
PEOPLE MIGHT ARGUE SOMEBODY WHO EVEN HAS MAYBE A WORSE

283
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,391
EVEN HAS MAYBE A WORSE ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD OR

284
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:14,595
ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD OR BACKGROUND THAN SCOTT PRUITT?

285
00:07:14,638 --> 00:07:17,097
BACKGROUND THAN SCOTT PRUITT? >> THE PUBLIC WAS NEVER -- I’M

286
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:18,365
>> THE PUBLIC WAS NEVER -- I’M SORRY, WHO ARE YOU ASKING?

287
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:19,166
SORRY, WHO ARE YOU ASKING? >> GO AHEAD, HOWARD.

288
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,201
>> GO AHEAD, HOWARD. >> THE PUBLIC WAS NEVER GOING TO

289
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:22,669
>> THE PUBLIC WAS NEVER GOING TO VOTE ON WHETHER SCOTT PRUITT WAS

290
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:23,904
VOTE ON WHETHER SCOTT PRUITT WAS GOOD OR BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

291
00:07:23,914 --> 00:07:25,406
GOOD OR BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. THEY DON’T GENERALLY DO THAT.

292
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,507
THEY DON’T GENERALLY DO THAT. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT VOTE THE

293
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,475
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT VOTE THE ENVIRONMENT, BUT NOT MANY.

294
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:29,410
ENVIRONMENT, BUT NOT MANY. WHAT THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL, BOTH

295
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,478
WHAT THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL, BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS OBJECT

296
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:33,313
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS OBJECT TO IS CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT.

297
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:35,182
TO IS CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT. THAT’S WHY TRUMP’S NUMBERS ARE

298
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:35,582
THAT’S WHY TRUMP’S NUMBERS ARE UNDERWATER.

299
00:07:35,593 --> 00:07:37,017
UNDERWATER. IT’S NOT EVEN HIS INCOMPETENCE,

300
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:38,752
IT’S NOT EVEN HIS INCOMPETENCE, WHICH HE IS, IT’S HIS CORRUPTION

301
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:40,221
WHICH HE IS, IT’S HIS CORRUPTION THAT’S REALLY UPSET PEOPLE.

302
00:07:40,264 --> 00:07:42,190
THAT’S REALLY UPSET PEOPLE. SO THIS IS NOT A VICTORY FOR THE

303
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,224
SO THIS IS NOT A VICTORY FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO GET PRUITT OUT OF

304
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,859
DEMOCRATS TO GET PRUITT OUT OF THERE, THIS IS A VICTORY FOR THE

305
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:46,026
THERE, THIS IS A VICTORY FOR THE COUNTRY THAT’S LONG OVERDUE.

306
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:47,694
COUNTRY THAT’S LONG OVERDUE. IF THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS

307
00:07:47,705 --> 00:07:50,097
IF THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS HAD BEEN DOING THEIR JOBS, HE’D

308
00:07:50,107 --> 00:07:52,099
HAD BEEN DOING THEIR JOBS, HE’D HAVE BEEN GONE A LONG TIME AGO.

309
00:07:52,109 --> 00:07:53,234
HAVE BEEN GONE A LONG TIME AGO. YOU DON’T THINK IF MITCH

310
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:54,902
YOU DON’T THINK IF MITCH McCONNELL AND PAUL RYAN WENT TO

311
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,503
McCONNELL AND PAUL RYAN WENT TO TRUMP AND SAID YOU’VE GOT TO

312
00:07:56,514 --> 00:07:58,806
TRUMP AND SAID YOU’VE GOT TO FIRE THIS GUY, WE CAN’T SUPPORT

313
00:07:58,816 --> 00:08:01,542
FIRE THIS GUY, WE CAN’T SUPPORT HIS AGENDA, HE’D HAVE BEEN FIRED

314
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:02,243
HIS AGENDA, HE’D HAVE BEEN FIRED RIGHT THERE.

315
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:03,978
RIGHT THERE. THE ISSUE FOR THE FALL IS THAT

316
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:04,945
THE ISSUE FOR THE FALL IS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DISGRACED THE

317
00:08:04,955 --> 00:08:06,013
DONALD TRUMP HAS DISGRACED THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY AND

318
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:07,248
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY AND THESE ARE JUST GOING TO BE

319
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,483
THESE ARE JUST GOING TO BE EXAMPLES OF THE INSIDIOUS

320
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:08,916
EXAMPLES OF THE INSIDIOUS CORRUPTION.

321
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:10,418
CORRUPTION. THERE WILL BE PLENTY MORE

322
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:11,252
THERE WILL BE PLENTY MORE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN.

323
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:13,254
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. >> ALEXI, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

324
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:14,188
>> ALEXI, WHAT DO YOU THINK? HOW MUCH ARE THE REPUBLICANS

325
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:15,156
HOW MUCH ARE THE REPUBLICANS GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER FOR

326
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,959
GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER FOR SCOTT PRUITT ON THE CAMPAIGN

327
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:18,293
SCOTT PRUITT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?

328
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:19,760
TRAIL? >> I THINK AS LONG AS DEMOCRATS

329
00:08:19,804 --> 00:08:20,961
>> I THINK AS LONG AS DEMOCRATS FOLD THIS IN THE CORRUPTION

330
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:22,597
FOLD THIS IN THE CORRUPTION ANGLE, THEY WILL HAVE TO ANSWER

331
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,966
ANGLE, THEY WILL HAVE TO ANSWER FOR HIM AND WE’VE SEEN THAT

332
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,870
FOR HIM AND WE’VE SEEN THAT ALREADY IN THE "A BETTER DEAL"

333
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,904
ALREADY IN THE "A BETTER DEAL" PLATFORM DEMOCRATS HAVE ROLLED

334
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:30,171
PLATFORM DEMOCRATS HAVE ROLLED OUT.

335
00:08:30,214 --> 00:08:31,305
OUT. CORRUPTION IS A BIG PART OF THAT

336
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:33,341
CORRUPTION IS A BIG PART OF THAT AND THAT EXTENDS TO SCOTT

337
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:35,777
AND THAT EXTENDS TO SCOTT PRUITT, RYAN ZINKE, BEN CARLSON,

338
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:36,878
PRUITT, RYAN ZINKE, BEN CARLSON, THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION,

339
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:37,345
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, STORMY DANIELS.

340
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:39,180
STORMY DANIELS. YOU SEE IT BEING USED BY NANCY

341
00:08:39,224 --> 00:08:41,449
YOU SEE IT BEING USED BY NANCY PELOSI, CHUCK SCHUMER, TOM

342
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:42,882
PELOSI, CHUCK SCHUMER, TOM STEYER IN CALIFORNIA IN HIS

343
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:43,885
STEYER IN CALIFORNIA IN HIS IMPEACHMENT CAMPAIGN AND ADS

344
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:44,819
IMPEACHMENT CAMPAIGN AND ADS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

345
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:46,754
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. SO I THINK THE LARGER CORRUPTION

346
00:08:46,764 --> 00:08:48,956
SO I THINK THE LARGER CORRUPTION SCANDAL AND SORT OF PICTURE YOU

347
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,592
SCANDAL AND SORT OF PICTURE YOU CAN DRAW FOR VOTERS, THE MORE

348
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:51,526
CAN DRAW FOR VOTERS, THE MORE REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE TO ANSWER

349
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,494
REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE TO ANSWER FOR IT AND THE MORE DEMOCRATS

350
00:08:53,538 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR IT AND THE MORE DEMOCRATS WILL BE ABLE TO USE THAT FOR
