1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
THE CLEVELAND BROWNS

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:16,450
HAD PASSED ON COLIN KAEPERNICK.

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,340
IN FACT I WOULD TRY DISTRACTION

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,640
AND SEE HOW IT TURNED OUT?

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,230
SO,
IT IS AN INTERESTING STORY ñ HE

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:33,360
IS AN INTERESTING PLAYER AND YOU
KNOW THAT HE IS CERTAINLY AMONG

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:42,540
THE TOP 96 QUARTERBACKS IN
THE LEAGUE, AND CERTAINLY WOULD

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,190
MAKE THE BROWNS.

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,399
BUT I AM ABOUT
TO GIVE THEM CREDIT.

10
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,399
THEIR COACH

11
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,520
HAD SAID DON'T BOTHER ME WITH
THIS KNEELING STUFF.

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,250
I WILL TELL

13
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:12,270
YOU WHAT HAPPENED AT THE GAME.

14
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:21,360
BUT 
BEFORE WE GET THERE.

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
EVEN

16
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,799
THOUGH HE IS NOT IN THE LEAGUE
YET, OTHERS HAVE PICKED UP HIS

17
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:40,280
CAUSE, INCLUDING MARSHAWN LYNCH
WHO IS NOW RAIDER.

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:48,759
ALSO MICHAEL

19
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,289
BENNETT WHO IS A REALLY GREAT
DEFENSIVE PLAYER FOR THE

20
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,259
SEAHAWKS, WAS ALSO KNEELING.

21
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:59,859
HE
SAID THIS.

22
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:03,989
SO, IS HE RIGHT?

23
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:04,989
WE

24
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:13,390
ARE ABOUT 
TO FIND OUT.

25
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,250
HERE,
LET'S DO IT.

26
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,110
WE HAVE OUR FIRST

27
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,070
WHITE PLAYER KNEELING.

28
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,790
THERE YOU
GO.

29
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,840
I DON'T WANT TO JUST

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,940
CELEBRATE THEM, LET'S JUST TAKE
A LOOK AT THE PICTURE.

31
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,940
12

32
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,860
MEMBERS OF THE BROWNS TOOK A
KNEE DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

33
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,480
AS YOU CAN SEE THEY WERE HUDDLED
TOGETHER AND THEY SAID THEY WERE

34
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
PRAYING.

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,000
THAT IS A NICE TOUCH.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,860
THAT INCLUDED THEIR RUNNING

37
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,530
BACK, DUKE JOHNSON, AND SOME OF
THE BETTER PLAYERS.

38
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,530
IT ALSO HAD

39
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,350
A NUMBER OF TEAMMATES, BLACK AND
WHITE, HOLDING ONTO THEIR

40
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,240
SHOULDER PADS.

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,610
THIS IS AS BIG A
TEAM STATEMENT AS WE HAVE SEEN

42
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,940
ON THIS ISSUE.

43
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,240
AS YOU CAN SEE,
ONE OF THE PLAYERS IS A WHITE

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:25,920
PLAYER.

45
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,420
I AM A HUGE FOOTBALL
FAN.

46
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,560
I WILL LOOK UP THAT GUY

47
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,760
BEFORE THE DRAFT.

48
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,920
HE EXPLAINS
THIS.

49
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,080
BLESS HIS HEART.

50
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
HERE IS

51
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:48,360
WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO GET YOU
TO PAY ATTENTION TO.IF PEOPLE

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,640
START GETTING FEARFUL AND
LASHING OUT FOR A SECOND THEY

53
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,630
MIGHT REALIZE THAT IT IS A FAIR
POINT.

54
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,640
WE HAVE A SITUATION IN

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,860
AMERICA WHERE WAY TOO MANY
PEOPLE ARE GETTING SHOT AND

56
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,180
KILLED BY POLICE WHEN THEY ARE
UNARMED.

57
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,260
WHEN KAEPERNICK DID IT

58
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,430
HE WANTS TO PROVE A POINT THAT
IT WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY

59
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,970
AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

60
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:26,820
IS NOT A
LEGITIMATE ISSUE FOR

61
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,820
AFRICAN-AMERICANS?

62
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,009
OF COURSE.

63
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,789
IF
SOMEONE IS TAKING A STAND IN

64
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:35,870
THIS CASE KNEELING TO BRING OUT
AN ISSUE, FOR ANYONE

65
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:43,210
IN AMERICA, SHOULD THEY GET
CREDIT?

66
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,180
THEY KEEP CLAIMING THAT

67
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,870
THE FANS ARE AGAINST IT.

68
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,949
BUT DID
YOU EVER POLL THEM?

69
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:51,949
WHAT ABOUT

70
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:52,949
PEOPLE THAT ARE FOR IT?

71
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:54,229
DO YOU
HAVE ANY IDEA WHICH ONES ARE THE

72
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:55,229
MAJORITY?

73
00:04:55,229 --> 00:05:06,930
IT IS 32 INCREDIBLY
WITCHY GUYS 

74
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:15,360
THAT ARE GETTING

75
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,960
THIS DECISION.

76
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,490
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T
HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE YOU

77
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,990
DID, OR THIS PERSPECTIVE.

78
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,830
YOU
MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO THEIR

79
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,580
PERSPECTIVE.

80
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,289
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
RESPECT THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

81
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:39,620
THE CLEVELAND BROWNS OR NOT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO YOU'LL

82
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,030
HAVE TO RESPECT THEIR SPEECH,
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE.

83
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,030
IT WOULD

84
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:51,069
BE A GOOD MOMENT FOR THE TEAMS
TO SAY THIS IS WHAT OUR PLAYERS

85
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,620
CARE ABOUT.

86
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,980
MAYBE IT IS
IMPORTANT?

87
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,060
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

88
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,699
YOU HATE AMERICA OR HATE THE
TROOPS.

89
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,629
WHENEVER THEY WANT AN

90
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:11,740
EXCUSE TO SHUT DOWN SOMETHING,
THEY SAY TROOPS.

91
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,069
I WANT TROOPS

92
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:19,819
TO DIE FOR NO REASON.

93
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:21,780
NOW WE SAY
WE DON'T WANT OUR CIVILIANS TO

94
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:31,249
DIE FOR NO REASON SO WE NEED
BETTER POLICE TRAINING.

95
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:32,249
IF YOU

96
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:37,219
SAY HEY YOU'RE BEING
DISRESPECTFUL TO POLICE, I WILL

97
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:39,770
CALL THAT NEARLY EQUALLY INSANE.

98
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,389
I WILL TELL YOU WHY.

99
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:42,389
YOU ARE

100
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:45,400
TELLING ME THAT NO GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS SHOULD BE CRITICIZED

101
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,969
IN AMERICA?

102
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:50,180
YOU ARE SAYING NO
GOVERNMENT BODY SHOULD BE

103
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,669
IMPROVED IN AMERICA?

104
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,880
THERE IS A
ONE GOVERNMENT BODY THAT IS

105
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
PERFECT.

106
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,449
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH
IT.

107
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:08,069
OH, YOU WANT TO CHECK BIG

108
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,069
GOVERNMENT.

109
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:13,389
YOU CLAIM YOU ARE
FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN

110
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:19,349
CHARLOTTESVILLE RALLIES ñ THEN
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE CHANTING

111
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:20,990
SOMETHING ELSE.

112
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:27,360
WHEN IT COMES TO
REAL FREEDOM OF SPEECH, DON'T

113
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,699
PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON IT.

114
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:33,689
BY THE
WAY GOD BLESS THE CLEVELAND

115
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:38,099
BROWNS ABOUT PLAYERS, THE
COMMANDER MADE A BIG STAN.

116
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,099
MY

117
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,830
GUESS IS THAT FAR FROM HAVING
THIS ISSUE GO AWAY, THIS IS

118
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,050
GOING TO GET LARGER AND LARGER.

119
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,729
BY THE TIME A QUARTER OF THE

120
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:51,449
LEAGUE IS KNEELING FOR THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM, IT WILL LOOK

121
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:55,720
AWFULLY STUPID THAT THEY DIDN'T
HAVE THE HERO WHO STARTED THIS

122
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,340
IN THE FIRST PLACE IN THE
LEAGUE.

123
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,240
MY GUESS IS THAT IF THIS

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,270
KEEPS GOING, SOMEONE WILL SAY
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO FIRE

125
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,270
HUNDREDS OF THEM?

126
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,499
OF COURSE
KAEPERNICK YOU ARE ONE OF THE

127
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:25,889
BEST QUARTERBACKS IN THE
COUNTRY, COME SAVE US.

128
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:32,720
IS 
THERE

129
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:40,270
ANYONE BLAKE MORTALS HAS NOT
OVERTHROWN?

130
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,270
AND IF OWNERS,

131
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:50,710
ESPECIALLY THE JAGUARS, PICK UP
THE PHONE AND CALL KAEPERNICK.

132
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,880
THAT SHIP HAS NOW COMPLETELY
SAILED, SO HOPE YOUR FOOTBALL

133
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
TEAM A LITTLE BIT.

134
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,520
FOR THE REST
OF US, YES, WE ARE LIKELY

135
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,240
LOOKING TO A GOVERNMENT BODY
THAT HAS GUNS AND BADGES WE GAVE

136
00:09:03,240 --> 00:00:00,000
THEM, TRY AND IMPROVE IT.
