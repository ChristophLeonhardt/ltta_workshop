WON THE RELEASE IN 2009, THREE
FEMALE -- TWO FEMALE JOURNALISM
OF NORTH KOREA.
YOU WILL COVER THE WORLD
WEDDING, PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN
MARKLE.
ONLY ONE REPORTING IN THE
CHAPEL.
HARRY HATES THE PRESS.
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN THE
OUTSIDE LOOKING?
>> I'M HAPPY TO BE THERE.
HOWIE: IT'S NOT NORTH KOREA.
>> I SPOKE TO A BRITISH SOURCE
YESTERDAY WHO TOLD ME THAT THIS
IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE IN THE UK,
PRINCE HARRY AND MEGHAN MARKLE
SINCE SHE HAS BECOME GIRLFRIEND,
ARE DISAPPOINTED OF COVERAGE
THEY HAVE RECEIVED AS COUPLE.
NOT JUST THE TABLOID PRESS IN UK
THAT CAN BITTER AND VICIOUS BUT
THE ACTUAL MAINSTREAM MEDIA IN
EUROPE HAS BEEN UNKIND TO HER,
MAKING DEROGATORY COMMENTS ANT
HER RACE, MAKING DEROGATORY
COMMENTS ABOUT COUPLING, IT'S
BEEN BRUTAL FOR THEM.
HOWIE: QUITE A FISH BOWL.
IN HARRY'S CASE IT'S NOT
UNRELATED THAT HIS MOTHER DIED
BEING CHASED BY PAPARAZZI.
>> ASIDE FROM THAT -- HOWIE:
AMERICANS LOVE ROYAL WEDDING.
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE
INTEREST BECAUSE OF MEGHAN
MARKLE, AMERICAN, ACTRESS,
BIRACIAL, DIVORCE, NOT EXACTLY
YOUR CE SINGTON PALACE BRIDE.
>> SHE'S 37 YEAR'S OLD, PRINCESS
DIANA WAS 21.
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER IS
DIFFERENT AND THIS IS WHY THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAS RIGHTLY
POINTED OUT JUST THE FACT WHO
SHE IS IS MODERNIZING THE
MONARCHY AND SHE'S CHANGING THE
FACE OF THINGS AND I THINK
THAT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY.
HOWIE: I LOVE THAT YOU TALK
TODAY A BRITISH SOURCE ABOUT THE
FEELINGS BECAUSE IT LET'S US
KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FROM A
JOURNALIST POINT OF VIEW.
IF YOU'RE MEGHAN MARKLE AND
YOU'RE SUDDENLY YOU'RE SO
SCRUTINIZED IT'S GOT TO BE
DIFFICULT.
>> AT THE GOING OF COURTSHIP U
HARRY PUT OUT STATEMENT
DEFENDING HER AND TELLING MEDIA
TO LAY OFF BECAUSE IT'S UGLY.
