the New York Times broke a story regarding a woman by the name of Renee Roeder she actually went to high school with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and she also happened to be one of the women who signed a letter vouching for Kavanaugh and his character so she's been very supportive of him until she found out what Kavanaugh was referencing in his personal page in the high school yearbook so the word Rijn 8 appears at least 14 times in Georgetown preparatory schools 1983 yearbook on individuals pages and in a group photo of nine football players including judge Cavanaugh who were described as Renee alumni it is a reference to Renee Schroeder again the woman who had supported Cavanaugh in that letter who was also then a student at a nearby Catholic girls school so mentions of Renee were part of the football players unsubstantiated boasting about their conquests so anyone who used that label in the yearbook was essentially signaling to everyone that they had essentially slept with her or at least hooked up with her so one student from the school who's familiar with all this says I can't express how disgusted I am with them then and now that's Sean Hagan he's a former Georgetown Prep student also it was reported that Cavanaugh is personal page in addition to the Renee trefor ins talks about the drinking a hundred kegs are bust and I'm only bringing look I don't care about their drinking the only reason why I'm bringing that up is because it is relevant given the interview he just gave to Fox News where he said you know that he was this good boy who just went to Sunday church every Sunday and who just focused on his studies and worked really hard and he made it seem as though some of the other students might have had one too many beers but he didn't take responsibility for his own drinking okay so there's that also Renee Schroeder dolphin joined those 64 women who said that they knew judge Kavanagh during their high school years and they signed a letter to the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee and here's a direct quote from Rene Schroeder dolphin herself she says I learned about these years your book pages only a few days ago I don't know what Rene Alumnus actually means I can't begin to comprehend what goes through the minds of 17-year old boys who write such things but the insinuation is horrible hurtful and simply untrue I pray their daughters are never treated this way I will have no further comment so she left it at that but I mean it gives you a sense of the way that they spoke about and treated women at the time so let me give you the one and only caveat before I rip into him that it does not necessarily mean that he did the sexual assault on dr. Blasi now what does it mean it means he was a terrible guy back then so no story has affected me as much as this one now it's kind of a weird thing to say given that the gravity of the other stories are so much worse but on those stories we have said throughout look there's a fair debate as to the recollections from 35 36 years ago and especially with the Ramirez allegation where she wasn't sure etcetera right and so if it's true they're much worse but you know some degree of questions remained about that this is super clear and gives you an insight into the kind of people that they were and so they they had a PR guy Jim McCarthy issue a statement saying the Renee trefor insist were quote intended to allude to innocent dates or dance partners no wasn't I was in high school we all were well you don't say you're a Renee alumni because you wanted to say oh my god I had a crush on her that's not what football players who are known for doing hundred kegs are bussed say okay it's in fact there's another great quote here if I think if I quote so and it's a former student who who knows Cavanaugh well his name is William Fishburne and he says those guys weren't big on crushes I think they felt that if a girl didn't want to them then they must be gay meaning the women or the girls I'm serious so I I knew those kind of guys and they're the worst so they would I mean look they're terrible in two different directions one you hook up with a girl and I get it you want to brag to your buddies I everybody understand that it's not the right thing you're gonna put it into a yearbook and you're gonna say that 14 of us hooked up with her knowing that that might get back to her god damn it don't you have any conscience and and then apparently a lot of them of course did not hook up with her in fact in this case this woman says I never even kissed them I don't know where he got that from so so apparently he was you want to go along with the guys and he wanted to pretend that he was a tough guy so your eye sees a Renee alumni he didn't even do anything with her like why are you shaming women who had who had the bad judgment to hook up with you in the first place Yeah right that drives me nuts and then they even make up one because you're so pathetic you couldn't hook up but you wanted a shame a woman that you couldn't hook up with anyway god dammit man that you know if it's always me off right and and it's by the way this is not as many women who are watching this right now they know that this is not an isolated case this is not unique any woman has gone through an experience where if they sleep with someone and that person ends up being a bad guy he'll go around and and you know paint you as a whore whatever it is and then if you refuse to sleep with that person they'll also slander you as either a prude or just make up that they did sleep with you when you really didn't that's a common thing and I want to reiterate and it is important this doesn't mean that he is guilty of any wrongdoing right doesn't mean this doesn't confirm any of the accusations but I do think that it paints a picture of who he really was because his public image or at least the public image that he's putting out there right now does conflict considerably with some of the evidence that's out there and one other thing I want to bring up look the FBI allegedly did six comprehensive background checks into Kavanaugh I mean that's least what the Senate Republicans and Trump himself have said over and over again there's already been an investigation they've already looked into their background they didn't find anything why did they find this I know that I would be curious if I saw that reference like what does that mean well look this is not a look I want to be clear if this was just by itself nobody's not getting confirmed to Supreme Court justice cuz they were a jerk in high school and they wrote terribly mean things in their yearbook but it was in the context of these stories what we're trying to figure out is who's right who's wrong and and one of the things I constantly questioned throughout all of this and you see me doing it on air is can a 17 year old be you know is that the same guy as a 53 year old that he is today no it's not okay no and I know it's not and of course many people change almost everybody changes in different degrees so I I'm sure he wouldn't do this as a judge I hope on the other hand some of his positions shame women on a national level on a macro level so but but a guy who does this was never a decent guy and like so could he become decent later I guess but I I know I would have known that guy in high school and hated him and so you know those guys you know every one of those guys and before the jury wasn't in on his character at least back then right now the jury's at least definitely in on his character back then which is he was a total and utter jerk who didn't mind humiliating and embarrassing people so that his bros could think that a little more highly of him and he can get a notch in his belt for the accomplishment of humiliating other women right I just want to quickly disagree with you slightly because I do think there are certain things like everyone grows I don't think that who you were in high school is indicative of who you are now but there are exceptions and so the exception that I make is if he is found you know guilty if there's some way of proving that he did attempt to rape someone that goes beyond you know character for me right because I think if you were willing to do that at any point in your life that says something about you right I and we were all you know immature juvenile whatever when we were in high school and and we all made sure we all grow up so I don't want to hold necessarily hold this whole yearbook thing against him but I think it's important to bring it up because again it conflicts with the image that he's trying to put out there at the moment no and I don't want anybody to get what I'm saying wrong the jury's out on whether someone can change that dramatically and I know I've changed a lot in my life so I wouldn't want to prejudge people on that what I'm saying as I just said a couple of seconds ago is juries on in on who he was back then and look I'm sure I did a lot of things when I was younger that was jerkish but this deeply humiliating someone I mean I hope to god that's not a Mike you know character and there's a there's a kind of person like you're the kind of guy I like you've told stories about this in postgame shows like you were the kind of guy who would literally get into physical fights with students that would pick on the powerless yeah and but I like to fight etc but you know but this at least tells you he doesn't mind hurting the feelings of someone else very significantly it's not an issue for him back then so if you take that as some evidence of other ways that he might want to hurt doesn't mind hurting other people's feelings or doesn't care about other people's feelings it's some evidence of that but to me at least them overwhelmingly it's evidence of his character back then and it ain't good and it's certainly not the choirboy picture he's trying to paint on Fox News like what you see click this subscribe button below and don't forget to ring the bell to never miss another video from
