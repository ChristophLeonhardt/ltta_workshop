despite the campaign 180 years of World Cups presidented viewing figures on its platform the most memorable cups in history see in Russia that is better later than never this is a story about the propaganda should become useful so4 lesson for all and many British fans who wanted to come did not do that and first of all the British media and the government are to blame for that because they

terrorism and transnational crime and challenges in the ICT sphere and there would be some bilateral meetings with the partners on the margin so for this event I would like to say once again that we would present to the exact schedule a bit later now we are moving to the most relevant issues of the international agenda and the situation in this country has been evolving in different directions and there are some positive moments and developments in this area that are connected with the actions of the Syrian governmental forces in the southwest of the country who are squeezing the militia and militants from of the Dara province and on the 16th of July 19 and of the territory was under control of the governmental forces and Russian officers also taking part in establishing truces in the region in the regions of the country and about 400 militants were taken from the administrative centre fell for there are two liberated to the north of the other country and the community real situation in there are has been improved and the crisis without the refugees alone the borders of will Jordan is almost has almost come to an end and the all practically come came returned to their homes Russian English servicemen continue of the year humanitarian assistance and also the doctors renting all the necessary assistance and we also talk about the UN convoys organized by International Red Cross and the Syrian society or for the Red Crescent and the settlement almost bloodless settlement of the situation in the south of Syria Syria demoralized the heads of the armed illegal armed groups in the north of the country in the ELA province they are trying to close their rounds and to mobilize of mobilized the civilians who are sympathizing sympathizing them but they do not manage that at all times and many civilians will come to the streets and as a signed sign of the protest against the outrage of their militants the illegal armed groups suffer losses due to the sectarian strife and the news representatives declared the executive of the ISIS leader in Italy which provoked a new series of murders in of field commanders orthopod and neutral it is also stated that there is a general strike in the city of serene where the civilians try to convince the illegal armed groups to come to terms with the authorities in order to stop all the cares and constant threats that when idea under crossfire of the militants now we are talking about talk about the white helmets who are undertaking sabotage activities and provocations in Syria they are undermining the confidence in the humanitarian assistance as a whole who have paid a lot of attention to the activities of this organization which is funded by our Western Western sponsors and these are white helmets organized the most resonant provocations including the alleged chemical attack by the Syrian authorities and the last case is duma on the 7th of april and fake news about the hospitals that supposedly destroyed the boil rational Syrian authorities and this association was a driving force in the information campaign against Syrians and against Russia and frankly speaking the international community has chosen democracy and human rights the freedom of the media for itself it has refused against these provocative activities and claiming to do so we should say that the white helmets are very talented persons but the other is cynical and this project was a success in influencing the public opinion in the West and in some countries of the region in fact undermining the confidence of the people in the activities of on the communitarian track and the lead leaders of the white helmets the turn out to be connected with chapada Nostra and other terrorist organizations and they were photos of white helmets with new sir fighters and there are images showing that the have taken part in murders of the refugees of the Syrian army and many there were many reports about the supposed evacuation of these white helmets are from Syria by the yes a led coalition and there is nothing surprising in this issue because so we're not speaking about the ordinary members of the white helmets that were used as a cover and which was to give credibility to the project but we speak about the leaders and the activists who were who knew about secret operation and information main campaign all of these dirty services helped these people to leave Syria who knows so maybe those specialists should be used under other circumstances and another place but we cannot but note the following speak about Syrian citizens so form should be evacuated from Syria under the National amnesty when they were conditions for returning of Syrians to the air Homs Syria joined gathered a group of our refugees who could be centered to the essay and to European countries maybe these new turning the story would provoke a new flow of migration in Syria may be among those that would be located there would be real terrorists and where would be these people in a few months what tasks that they would carry carry out all these issues that are obvious in this case they are not about only these days there where these what hummus would be received this also affects that all the international security and we have witnessed such operations in the world when the people came out the duties for money they were ever created but now we are speaking about the transporting and to other continents including to Europe and we asked our partners to ponder upon what we are saying and we hope that we they would respect the sovereignty of Syria would not create a problems not to others neither to themselves and this is a very acute situation it's more acute than it seems according to the information that we have this information was conveyed to international organization there was a convoy of white helmets come in to Syria and the cause contained the means of individual protection and they were chemists from India they were also the parts of missiles that were shipped there we cannot rule out that these parts that were delivered by the white helmets that they can be used for their purposes or when these humanitarian agents would be removed from the region we can not rule out anything maybe it will be a provocation a massive ones maybe blaming the local authorities in the future so everything that I've said including the issues of our security and other issues all this information was conveyed to the relevant international organization now I'd like to talk about the Syrian refugees the signal today's strategic victory over terrorism in Syria has been reached the stability and the vast part of the Syrian territory is being restored and there are all the conditions for the beginning of a serious and great scale work to mitigate one of the serious consequences of the Syrian conflict which is the problem of refugees and internally displaced people IDPs the UN estimates that nearly 7 million of Syrian refugees are located outside the Syrian territory most of them are located in Lebanon Jordan Turkey Iraq Egypt and in countries of Europe on the 3rd of July Damascus heard an official statement made by this Syrian government to the Syrian people which we've been talking about this actually the Syrian government has called the Syrian people who love the country to come back by guaranteeing the all the necessary conditions for the security and on discriminatory attitude but at the same time it's necessary to restore essential economic and social infrastructure and to create troops in order to provide voluntary in decent return of Syrians and will actually need to carry out de-mining activities we all understand that government of Syria cannot do all this activities alone we need the support of the international community since you have millions for the support of white helmets who that can now be evacuated from Syria then you will have all the necessary funds for the essential infrastructure the facilitation of the return of millions of Syrians will help to open a new page for the solid settlement of the situation in Syria on a collective basis there are all the lists of those who want to return to Syria the first groups have already crossed the Lebanon Syria water we view all the consolidation efforts - for the return of refugees and social economic restoration of Syria as enough three elements for dressing all the objectives of the liquidation of the Islamic state and other terrorist organizations to the Syrian soil elimination of all the reasons that facilitate the spread of terrorists next to my studio which is we welcome all the initiatives and efforts of the international community to provide assistance to Syrian line with the UN Security Council resolution 2254 from our part during the preparation for another tense meaning of the Astana format to facilitate the settlement we know that it will take place in Sochi on the 30th and 31st of July will pay special attention to refugees we have invited the UN High Commissioner and refugees to take part in this meeting at the same time Russian soldiers on the sole on the ground are making all the tireless efforts to provide human assistance to the Syrian population including IDPs who went to the areas liberated from terrorists and to clean all the populated areas from explosives we need to restore the economic activities of Syria which is very important for the successful successful address address to successful address the problem of Syrian refugees we call on to remove all the sanctions financial economic sanctions that block the supplies of medicine and food to Syria such measures the work against the Syrian people and they impede the social and economic restoration of Syria and therefore they slow down the return of refugees to their homes another topic will talk about the closed region the situation in the Gaza Strip Maskell welcomes with imitation of Egypt the agreement on the resumption of ceasefire regime between Israel and Palestine groups in Gaza after the outbreak of notorious collation around the Gaza Strip on the 14th of July now remind you that there day after the massive interchange to Palestine teens died and more than 30 Palestinians were injured in Israel four people were injured in a start we call Israelis and Palestinians to be moderate in directions and to take over necessary measures in order to avoid a new cycle of violence that may result in to negative consequences we need to it's necessary to provide to organize rallies in a peaceful way and it we also call Israel not to take any violent actions against the civil population but at the same time it's necessary to resume the political process between the Israelis and Palestinians on the well known international legal system without which peace wouldn't be achieved in Middle East another topic which really made too nervous a lot of people in Russia and the United States also and in other countries of the world I'm talking about the arrest of the Russian citizen rebooting are we actually were very concerned by the arrest of this Russian citizen according to the materials published on the website of the American Minister of Justice Nesbitt Anna is charged with the unregistered activities as an foreign agent such far-fetched claims against our camp at trade there seemed strange as we know Maria Bettina is in the United States for a long time and she was studying in one of the Washington University's she didn't hide from anyone it seems that the CBI instead of I can't countering crime they're just working for some political order they just continue to promote this row so phobic hysteria so they try to publish you made-up sensations about Russian meddling into American domestic processes on the 13th of July 12 Russian nationals were accused and they were outside the American territory and now we hear new ridiculous claims against the Russian citizen Maria Bettina but also she was arrested we can analyze this situation for a long time but we think that this arrest was made in order to show the US and their allies how the striction got serious because the media started to talk about they stood they started to talk about Maria Putin as a spy they linked her to some security services they started to escalate the situation without having any facts for doing so and also I cannot ignore that because it was mentioned by many because it all has happened in the lead-up to the bilateral summit in Helsinki so there was a task to minimalize the positive effect of this high-level meeting and do it as soon as possible it seems that's somebody just took the calculator and what and watch in order to understand when this decision to arrest maria butanna should be taken to do everything to derail the outcomes of the summit of Russian and American presidents so all this was made in time we can talk a lot we can well on that in a following manner if you have some claims against this person and it's not a question of a scale of national security it can all pay attention to this you can always ask Russia to pay attention to this but the most important thing is that this story could be discussed in the course of the preparation period for Russia this matter could be referred to Russia it matter could be discussed on the sidelines of their summit or it could be mentioned during the summit no nothing was mentioned all this situation is made up after this summit just it appears that it seems that someone was sitting with a calculator and watches to to understand the day and the hour to escalate the situation in the media and despite the fact that Russia is being talked about a lot in the United States then the media tries to get the hype on that and so it worked we do our utmost to protect our citizens to protect its legitimate rights and interests we our embassy have contacted authorities and they try to receive consular access to Maria Bettina and this opportunity of consular access should be provided to them also they were some fake stories it was difficult to believe that but Maria but they started to look for Mary Bettina in the of russia-us consultations they were fake stories about that in the social media now let's go to another topic Salisbury and Amesbury the situation in this two british towns has become a traditional part of our briefings i could you know it's like a traditional tea drinking ceremony as in traditional british houses at five o'clock we have there still are no facts about that the interest to this is increased by the media who provides different forecasts and hypothesis about that they want to show like the officials are doing their best to investigate the story but actually they divert the attention of the media and of the society we have seen so many absurd fakes published by the british media and we haven't seen such number of them before and this fake stories which are presented as leaks from british law enforcement agencies but we have no idea actually if these are leaks from law enforcement agencies or from a structure and specialists known what structure and talking about which is in charge of fake news so everyone tries to set out their a hypothesis so we can make a top chart of absurd of what we see in the british media but these articles unfortunately influence readers they shape the perception of the situation and they take part of the campaign after to resume a statement may in Parliament with the least of flimsy allegations and insults against our country we cannot ignore this and we're not we will not ignore this we see that top this top church includes the US media now for example I can say that the New York Times article has a special place in this top chart this article was published in the lead-up to the russia-us summit why did this article appear in New York Times in the lead-up to the summit it's all clear just remember that it's to resume who said in the lead up to the summit she called the United States on to include this topic in the agenda of bilateral negotiations and New York Times pays attention of the Americans society to this issue but they are doing it in an absurd way for example the author of this article I have to say that this is an article but actually it's absurd she says the article says that the Jerry youth is responsible for that the material says that the Russian military reconnaissance is that reconnaissance that is whose officials are accused of meddling into American elections and therefore there is possible for their poisoning for the poisoning in Salisbury we're not surprised because this isn't the best traditions of classical masterpieces of Western journalism why am I saying it because there are no facts so there are just evaluations in opinions without any facts the information that Gerry you is suspected or it's privatized French is suspected it's very important this information is presented with a reference to a British and two Americans one of them is a retired American official who knows the investigation process so we see that the British leaked information on this sensitive international matter this investigation as they say first they look at two foreign security service and secondly they lick it to an individual if they are talking about some former a US official so these are some leaks and all this takes place in the lead up to the US Russia summit but New York Times gives several paragraphs to this new investigation but again but again they don't provide any serious information about that I just will answer a question why are they doing all day all that resume wanted to include incident in Salisbury names burry in the lateral negotiations between Donald Trump and radomir Putin and this topic started to circulate in the lead-up to the summit and during the summit in Helsinki the newspaper was well aware of the fact that they are going to publish material that they didn't check and they said that this poisoning might be conducted by other Russian security services or other non-state agents this article that was published that was based on leaks references and but in the lead up to the summit it's all a part of a large public a provocative game everyone is silent when it comes to real facts remember in the briefing we offered to check the financial account of Porton Down someone heard our advice so let's analyze real facts I have no right to make any conclusions I just see facts and I would like to voice them here so some representatives of the media and of the social media took our advice I don't know what were the reasons what were their reasons for that and they have found the financial audit account of Wharton down so that it's a very interesting document and they are talking about the outer document of Port endowed this document provides information about its unsustainable financial position and several incidents during the financial period which is 2016 2017 according to the document the important down was 37 million pounds and their circulation has decreased from 612 to 587 million pounds then we can find other gloomy financial figures that have influenced and impacted the financial welfare of Portland down personnel and in 2017 they were three thousand and seven hundred people what an interesting laboratory it says that over the last five years the index of corporate spirit and loyalty has dropped significantly and its level was about 55% we'll give a reference to this document in the text of today's briefing the loyalty of the personnel is justified by the decreased salary and personal turn our recruitment of temporary workers what an interesting information these are real facts if it's not true okay we need to hear the information from Portland down again we're going to provide a link to this document again we're talking about figures when it comes to the recruitment of temporary workers the person Alberto down was also annoyed by the fact that their salary has decreased in the car in the continent contrast to their leadership whose salary remained at the same level there were some other conclusions made in the document the document also says that that for the financial period of 2016 2017 Security Service of Porton Down has registered 61 incident if we're talking about security matters here I just offer you to read this document to understand what I'm talking about after the Salisbury incident just in several days in several hours the Defense Secretary of Great Britain's made a statement to allocate additional 48 million pounds to the chemical of laboratory to combat new chemical biological radiation or radiological and nuclear threats so everyone everything what's going on inside Porton Down historically and we have provided all that information what's going on now can interest it can interest many film directors and authors of detective fiction why no one is interested in that well we understand why the society is not interested in it because media doesn't talk about it we have talked about several death of certain people who worked in Porton Down Under non investigated and mysterious circumstances over the last 20 years we were talking about the strange death of the Soviet microbiologist whatever pathogenic who worked in the Leningrad Institute of high-purity biologicals the deaths of David Kelly full Norman who took the office of dead killer after his death we were talking about the scientist Richard Holmes about Richard Holmes we found very interesting facts in open sources particularly I'm talking about the article BBC published on the 9th of October 2013 it's very strange sure why no one is interested in such materials maybe it's much more interesting for everyone to talk about absurd negotiations in absurd information about security services again this article was published by BBC on the 9th of October 2013 I advise you to pay attention to that and read it so Holmes had to acquit Portadown after he faced with this disciplinary case regarding the fact that he bullied some of the people who worked there he planned to sue the laboratory and then we're interesting information he he actually tried to apply for janitors job where well some of you maybe guessed that he tried to apply for a job in a district hospital in Salisbury where the scribbles took treatment well it's an interesting but everyone tries to divert her attention and when we try to talk about facts published already everyone says it's Russian propaganda they have decided to present other fake stories but actually we haven't were voiced any worsens because we don't have any right for that will just make references to materials which were published in the United Kingdom long before the situation that took place in Salisbury in 2018 why the leading specialists of the laboratory the high cell rate specialists decided to apply for a janitor's job in District Hospital of Salisbury according to police reports mr. Holmes committed a suicide he'd drank antifreeze but before that he told his wife that please don't worry I'm not going to do anything silly again it's all written in the baby scene we're going to provide the link in the material of this briefing experts we're talking a lot about mysterious circumstances of home staff and Cally's death I'm just saying this because we should be close to facts because in the Great Britain after mr. scribble was conscious he went to Great Britain he chose the house in Salisbury which has several kilometers away Porton Down laboratory I know there are so many good places to live and Great Britain and they are not close to the laboratory with such story several days ago we have seen a report that a museum that has the same problems as the previous documents we'll see again the selective approach and the template evaluation when the reality is ignored and they apply the same double standards as before with regards to human rights problematic frankly speaking this document is so biased and from our point of view it is just made in the cotton well in accordance with the russophobic standards that are promoted by british establishment that it doesn't require any comment from our side we continue to receive the note how to build democracy hiding the real problems and their country and there were a lot of them and the attempts to find out the real problems in terms of human rights hiding and we recommend our British partners to be more self criticizing and to pay attention to the situation in the Ukraine and in the European Union with neo Nazism and the racism that is getting more and more strong and racial discrimination xenophobia of the response of intolerance and violation of rights of minorities we go to another region we're concerned with the situation in Pakistan the extremists are destabilizing the situation in the run-up to the general elections planned for 25th of July 22 people were killed in a suicide attack including a candidate from Pashto party on the 13th of July in Banu landmine explosion near candidates convoy killed 4 people and the same day in mustn district a terrorist attacks place and it killed 130 people including but is candidate we resolutely condemned the such terrorist attacks that have nothing to do with Islamic values and cannot be justified we support the measures on strengthening security by the authorities of the country including the involvement of militaries to protect polling stations and a pre-election campaign now I would like to say a few words about the global strategy on countering opre spread the documents announced by the UN staging action to respond to the global threats of opioids is called to consolidate efforts of all states and organization in the context of unprecedented growth of production of opiates in Afghanistan and become a universal basis for International Cooperation this strategy is aimed at strengthening the potential of law enforcement and the potential to decrease the demand on drugs and to diminish financing of drugs projects in Afghanistan and in nearby countries Russia is concerned with drug threat coming from Afghanistan and close close linkages of Afghanistan was terrorism Afghanistan is still remains the main of producer of drugs in the world the opium poppy cultivation grew by 63% the production of opiates by 87 percent and the involvement of people in this sector is twice more than the number of security agencies working in the country we think that it is necessary to consolidate efforts of all international community and it was a responsible approach from the authorities of Afghanistan in terms of production of opioids we are confirming our readiness to support and to provide our assistance in training the drug police we cannot but comment on the Brussels statement on Macedonia we are concerned by the statement by prime minister who said made a statement about the press by agreement with Greece and we think that it is all in needed for only one purpose to create this integration hysteria there are no facts as we see that could confirm the words of Macedonian Prime Minister and the continuation is are not foreseen to the we see that countries are interfering in the internal affairs of another state and probably it is okay them we see that Kofi ruling coalition is conducting a political internal game aimed at threatening their own population we were always advocating for mutually beneficial agreement between Skopje and essence without external imposition of timeframes and that would be based on a wide consensus and perfect constitutional and legal basis but unfortunately this didn't happen the agreement like resulted in deep divisions among people in the Republic of Macedonia and in Greece it is clearly not helping to strengthen peace and security in Balkans and serves as an instrument to involve the Republic of Macedonia in NATO few words about mass media in the West I can't leave it unnoticed this is not to criticize rather to ask for solution taking into account the cases of violation of legislation by the journalists in Russia and believe me there are a lot of such cases and we are trying to solve them in a working manner and we are talking to journalists directly or convey this information through the embassies representing the country the journalist is coming from but this has become a general trend and I just have to mention this I would like to draw the attention on the necessity to receive a special permission to conduct video footages with the help of drones this is not our invention this is an international experience every country has its own regime of using drones and we have our own one of the last cases and there were a lot of such cases lately I would like to mention just one the last one and I would like this to be really the last case we face such a situation I'm speaking about the illegal use by tan journalists of a drone for making a panoramic view footage in Saransk in Mordovia arena unfortunately lack of permission led to seizure of an expensive equipment and administrative offence we understand very well the desire of a journalist to make a good picture a good footage video of good quality we're speaking about important sports events and facilities which are interesting and important but to avoid similar incidents we call upon all of you to follow Russian legislation like to say that this is not just a problem of foreign correspondents in Russia Russian journalists in other countries abroad in a similar way face similar problems violating legislation of dead countries we are also involved in note correspondence and with the communication between the ministries and we are communicating with the official representatives of the places where drones used by Russian journalists and journalists and I would like to call on you to be attentive to the such issues to ask for clarifications if you need it and we are ready to cut thread through association of correspondents then and this will be just useful for you another issue another topic I would like to cover Deutsche Welle we paid attention to the video clip by Russian outlet of Deutsche Welle about the injured Ukrainian soldiers in Germany let's call it this way even they were speaking about battalion but on the 50th second of the video we can clearly see well as a1 of this military man man gives salute Nazi salute and we can see that this act is unacceptable and we're speaking about the material that was prepared by Russian outlet of Deutsche Welle we received a huge number of letters and messages through social networks about this case we were surprised that this video by Deutsche Welle notice that this statement is this video had Nazi salute is not real doesn't correspond to the reality and I would like to just ask how did you realize that was and analysis conducted or some expertise how do chavalla is outlet and Russia made this conclusion because there is another wave of rage that is coming up and unfortunately we always speak about the growth of Nazis Nazism and that has become evident even for those who are clearly supporting everything that is ongoing there when during one of our recent briefings we spoke about the article ukrainian have real problems with the right radical groups and they would like deutsche welle to familiarize itself with this article and to have a look at what they do promoting north atlantic agenda and my question is who are you trying to fool around people who saw this with their own eyes it was just not working this way we called international organization to be seriously concerned about this case too and to have a look at this about the anti cements muds and kiev and some nationalist grounds to be also or worked over in ukraine and what is our task is to show you crane and when we show when we speak about ukraine we are speaking also about the people living there but what if these people for victims of the nationalists who are involved in all these cases just remember multiple cases of attacks on the center of culture in kiev who is doing this journalists know it was done by nationalists many of them could be called neo-nazis known assests just remember the statements comments and what they showed near the Embassy of the Russian Federation in India than in wolf and the arson er in Oscar rot and I would like to draw your attention to the growth of nationalism in Ukraine and the outrageous actions they do I would like to call the relevant organization to evaluate the situations the history shows that we cannot pass by through such events because it is just dangerous we also have paid our attention to the information about the initiated of investigation against Russia today in Australia as a foreign agent we are speaking about the publication in the Australian newspaper and Australian Federal Police is conducting a preliminary investigation against the people who could fall as those involved in the case and accordance with the legislation about foreign agents in Australia we are studying the situation we are expecting the information directly from the experts and in the near future we'll make a detailed comment on this if the information is confirmed as it is informed in the media then we see another example of so-called solidarity that is unfortunately has become a textbook example a narrative another country that is trying to expel a Russian media from global media space we understand very well what is the center that makes the decision about this campaigns and how they implement this scenarios in different other places we know who is elaborating the decision and we know that masks but we would like to confirm that Moscow keeps the right and retaliatory measures about the situation with Russian journalists whenever it happens and our position hasn't changed and I would like to say again that we always support the freedom of word we work with criticism against us and we work this not by prohibiting work of other media representatives but we do it through providing more open and more transparent information on the issues but in particular this case retaliatory measures will definitely take place I would like you all to understand this another issue the citizens of foreign states continue to express our Garrety and support to the actions of the Armed Forces combating terrorism Syria in Italian city of al-assad in Toscana the local authorities erupted at 2 meter marble monument in honor of the hero of Russia Alexander to henkaa who was surrounded by ISIL near Palmyra he was he refused to be taken prisoner and took the fire this undertaking of Italian citizens was supported by the Italian and forces

I would I can comment only on what happened yesterday we are going to keep in touch with our I'm embassy in Washington and we are going to update this information as soon as we get the access we will inform you no new information you gave me a wonderful opportunity to ask about Trump I know what you were thinking subconsciously how CNN I would not think about Trump if you admit well of course we have heard about the devaluations from Minister Lavrov and the outcomes of the summit do you have any other comment Sonia idea is about this we spoke about this during joint press conference and Russian president announced all of them and then later he said about our evaluations to Fox News and we cannot even imagine great explanation of what was discussed there he Russian president mentioned what is going to be done later they're going to continue work as a follow-up of the outcomes of the summit thank you yes please really no tsudzuki em just a few comments about Trump we cannot avoid this topic today during press conference maybe you didn't pay attention but he said that the United States is grateful to Russia for the assistance in countering ISIL and terrorism could you comment on this we as you perfectly understand countering terrorism cannot be carried out I mean the broadcasting of our outcomes on countering terrorism cannot be carried out 24 hours a day we are conducting and the work we are exchanging information we are announcing the results do you remember when the information was given from the American special services and when the information was given to Russian special services it was critical to prevent terrorist attacks similar actions have been done by the Russian side transmitting information and critical facts to the American colleagues they not always use them but from Russian side we had not just examples but we have a desire to make this a full-fledged world we were against blocking contacts on this issue and the second thing we have Syria where hostilities taking place and where we are countering terrorists and this is a difficult and it's a different example of how complicated different from theory is the situation but we still cooperate on countering international terrorism in particular with countering ISIL yes please good afternoon the question of the Bulge of the summit and booting what developments could be in the Syrian crisis after the summit it is not connected to this question but a year ago these day we held an interview with Victor Oliveira Sergei Lavrov and this was a remarkable day in the history of journalism and would like to thank you for this interview I think we should not to thank us about the destiny for that because maybe we would someday talk about this interview but not today and for the changes that can happen after the summit this was defined by both sides what has been done and what could have been done this is the terrorism and the fight against terrorism I've said that the work is underway but we have taught that we need to achieve on the exchange of information on intensifying efforts and on political coordination also so all these objectives and ask who were names were named and now we are going to move in that direction that was set forward by our presidents good afternoon Mary alati minute US agency we have two questions first one and now the Korean agency stocks says that the mr. Magoo referred Vice foreign minister came to Pyongyang and the second one last week there was a a successful rescue operation in Tallinn tellin as Russian side participated in it as for the second question we've already stated that the Russian emergency ministry offered its help for conducting this a rescue operation in Thailand but his participation was not needed but during the operation the helicopters Russian production were used including those from helicopters of Russia company we are happy that we could make our efforts and save the lives of the young for the list and the Okocha I'd like to underline once again that we have offered our direct assistance as for your first question I will have additional information on it issue a bit later yeah please my name is Alexander I'm representing portal news da true I have two questions the first one right into the World Bank into has a rated Russian economy economy xi regarding the GDP and how could you command on that and maybe that could be regarded as change in the stance of all this organization and the second issue I said well arab-speaking News Agency they speak about homes agreement and they either live region and they speak about these peaceful agreement on a temporary basis which expires soon as for the first question the economic parameters of Crimea when assessing the GDP of Russia this is a matter of reality and one can have different political preferences but when we are speaking about economic indexes we should base our data on reality this is not an issue for us and crime here now is a territory of the Russian Federation which has been defined by its citizens in 2014 and we perfectly understand that there are many political approaches in the world regarding this issue and we are conducting on work bringing this issue to reality and not to some of these expectations so it's a also a matter that it's a matter of the past but as for economic parameters we should take into account the real things and the second one year I will answer it as for mr. magoo love we are speaking about planned expected constant consultations and we would inform you on the outcome yes please Reznik kavkaza heard of foreign minister of Kazakhstan said that v caspian summit will be held on the 16th of august in our town what are the expectations regarding the summit and how does Russia regard to the stages of the Caspian region we do not comment actually the summit issues these spokes there are spokespersons of definite countries for that and there will be also a Council of foreign ministers and I would like you to contact the Office of the President on your question I would inform you later on the shadow of the contacts during the next briefing yes please I finally get Anoosh there are many Greek media outlets that write an information that before the recent crisis Russian Foreign Minister telephoned our Minister and sad that Russia was going and to suspend the agreement between Skopje and Athens at eleven of the UN I would like to ask you whether this telephone call has taken place and how it would you comment on that there are many other publications on just choosing one this is the first instance in my work when we witnessed such an interesting campaign and they say that there is a video where Russian diplomats tried to bribe Greek deputies for them to vote against this agreement may be good to provide you comment that if there is no response on the part of Russia Russia is not too interested in answering maybe Russia would respond to the expulsion and so on and so forth as for the first part of your question that mr. Lavrov ah threatened his colleague it's absurd it's nonsense and it's weird that the Greek side has not provided any comment on that and it's very surprising it's nonsense it's absolutely and maybe you can also provide euros unanimous similar words to this thing and even in the most complicated circumstances and bilateral relations that happening because of the third countries we understand that the talk about the destinies of our countries about our peoples who should not be hostages - the dirty political games that these countries are being thrown into and at this time it was Greece and we know about such situations and Greece politicians they are well aware that we know that the pressure exerted upon Greece was one of the strongest and I can say that we are basing on facts and the first waves of this pressure they were the ways that Athens could stand and is not only the same single capital where a decision was taken not to follow this way and we know how such politicians were treated that didn't become subjected to the pressure of a Great Britain and after that American partners came into that play and every country and every leadership determines to what extent it can suppose to that pressure and there are testimonies in many publications that speak to the pressure there's a project leading to the standoff between Moscow and Athens this also was proved and you can see this in a number of publications with your own eyes the people of Greece should keep in touch with Russia with the Russians and not suffer from daily provocations which Athens has been drawn into we are speaking about politics and there are certain consequences for these actions sorry to see these tarnishes the bilateral relation and it doesn't bring and nothing constructive to their development the second question the video we I think we should watch this video because I haven't seen it have no idea what you're talking about can I pose another question your last words that Greece I should still communicate with Russia without such provocations and turns and so on recent publications in Greece saying that Russia is willing not to let its people come to Greece as tourists you know in this time several years I would speak personally that our citizens can choose by themselves aware they should and want to spend their vacations basically no their political opinion on their willingness to be involved in political problems so it is their own business and we are given recommendations basing on the level of security in on a logical situation in this of that country on the level of crime crime rate this is all available information and it is open and it is published on the website including on our website of the ministry and also on the website of tourist associations and then that's it a Russian citizens can choose where are they girl where they spend their vacation we should understand that when there are negative publications when there are insulted statements on the part of some politicians it doesn't around any sympathy Russian people people are reading much they do not have any limits as to receive an information they see everything and the sick and tired and I can see say about that basing on the person with whom I talk so they are tied up for the attempts to isolate our country and to wage sanctions wars they see that it's not fear its unjustified it's just rhetoric deeds the expulsion of diplomats they are organized campaigns and Greece should also take this into account it's just logic it's not about threats or anything please governments follow federal news agency now that you're not commanding his summons but it is question relating to that American congressman said that the planning to organize a meeting with the participation of an interpreter that worked in Helsinki to know what was said by mr. Putin is it admissible that when because this was a bilateral meeting and how could Russia react to this if it happens not in this context but in other contexts we've heard we've heard the stories about high-level meetings when the presidents or high-ranking officials distorted the content of the meetings and we always said that we do not have any problems with providing genuine information about what happened we do not have any inconveniences and if their attempts to come to this and even to invent the content of the meeting I was asked about the meetings on the margin of the summit this is the first thing the second thing it's all about political culture in the United States let them comment such actions and decisions by themselves this is a question about the political culture yes please good afternoon trans news agency the my question relates to the Brussels a meeting of foreign mission and mister of Armenia and they discussed their steps to settle the nagorno-karabakh process can this meeting give an impetus to the negotiating process as you know we do not comment on bilateral meetings where Russia not bodies does not participate and as we maintain contacts are with the OSCE group we can say that any conducts carried out by the side should a contributor to the general task of nagorno-karabakh settlement I like to underline once again that to the outcome of the meeting the efficiency should be commented by the participants and we welcome everything that both sides assess as a step forward towards the settlement over towards the continuation of the dialogue thank you good afternoon Sputnik on your agency learn is varied of returning to the world cup of a Russian president said that we should have for what provide a non visa entry to the fans are holding their ID fan IDs this is a initiating to the consular department what I doing in that respect and what action should be carried out so it's Brazilian or other fans how should it be done maybe only the sense that I'm holding this ID can come or not the process this is not a question of the Foreign Ministry's only we are talking about certain we're not talking about certain changes in the with the regime we are talking about an extra ordinary situation when we are going to extend the regime for the document that authorized people to be on the Russian territory and when I'm talking about visas here I need to say that the Ministry of sport of the Russian Federation has prepared a draft amendment to the federal law of the 7th of June 2013 number 108 on the preparation and organization of the World Cup 2018 in the Russian Federation Confederation Cup 2017 and changes in certain legislation acts of the Russian Federation which provides for the extension of multi visit visa free entry to Russia for foreign nationals who hold thin IDs till the end of the 2018 this quite a difficult phrase that I have just voice but actually we are working on the announcement because I need to say that the the matters of these are free entry of NID holders the verification of these documents and decreasing risks of illegal migration fall under the competence of them Ministry of Communications Federal Security Service and Ministry of domestic affairs at the same time that is a free regime will not cover the family of NID holders but at the same time we're working on the matter of introducing simplified procedure of visual issuing based on personal requests of fan ad holders so that's what the president said and we're working on it and I think that soon we will receive details and decisions and solutions for that because we need was just the framework which was being developed at the moment do you have any more questions yes please it's just difficult to leave you here furious mania for international life Journal talking about the rest of Murray abou Tina this is not the first case for the meaning of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin they was using the item in the media that would be an amnesty for hackers arrested in the United States I have a question if the ministry has mechanism to protect Russian citizens abroad what do you mean by this mechanism like assistance provided to them we provide a system through our consular offices will provide assistance we help to find lawyers we provide assistance in terms of documents legalization of documents we help them to protect their legitimate rights and interests when they are violated this is just at of an iceberg the full material I can provide later if you needed but since you have touched upon this matter I would like to offer you just to have several seconds just imagine in full detail what would happen if on the Russian territory in Moscow in st. Petersburg in Yekaterinburg an American student would be arrested a student that have all the necessary documents a student who was would be studying international relations a student who was acting in line with the Russian legislation so this person is arrested just because she is carrying out some activities it should be authorized but she hasn't filed any documents for that just imagine the situation an American citizen is arrested just imagine a scale of an information campaign that would would be launched we see this absurd in situation where all human rights are ignored there is just a pretext to escalate even more the situation when there is a domestic struggle in the United States they forget about studentship they forget about humanitarian cooperation and as we know this person maria Buettner she didn't have any problems with the law we were very shocked when we heard that this person was carrying out activities related with her studies just some information that you should think about so I say you farewell and have an stay
