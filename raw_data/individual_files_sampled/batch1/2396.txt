and now that I am your president America will expose the crimes of the Castro regime and stand with the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom because we know it is best for America to have freedom in our hemisphere whether in Cuba or Venezuela and to have a future where the people of each country can live out their own dreams our new policy begins with strictly enforcing US law we will not live sanctions on the Cuban regime until all political prisoners are freed freedoms of assembly and expression are respected all political parties are legalized and free and internationally supervised elections are scheduled elections the profits from investment and tourism flowed directly to the military the regime takes the money and owns the industry the outcome of last administration's executive action has been only more repression and they moved to crush the peaceful democratic movement therefore effective immediately I am cancelling the last administration's completely one-sided deal with Cuba we will enforce the ban on tourism we will enforce the embargo we will take concrete steps to ensure that investments flow directly to the people so they can open private businesses and begin to build their country's great great future a country of great potential you
