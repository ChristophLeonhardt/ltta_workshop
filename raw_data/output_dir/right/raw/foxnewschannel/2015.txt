1
00:00:00,547 --> 00:00:00,914
WITHDRAWS.

2
00:00:00,914 --> 00:00:03,717
IF THE OTHER COUNTRIES PART OF

3
00:00:03,717 --> 00:00:04,918
THIS AGREEMENT REMAIN COMMITTED.

4
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:05,252
SHANNON.

5
00:00:05,252 --> 00:00:07,187
>> Shannon: THANK YOU VERY

6
00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:08,154
MUCH.

7
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:09,323
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN FROM

8
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:10,524
CALIFORNIA JOHN GARAMENDI MET

9
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:11,358
WITH JOHN KERRY LAST WEEK TO

10
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:13,327
DISCUSS THE IRAN DEAL.

11
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:14,061
HE JOINS US NOW.

12
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:17,831
THE CONGRESSMAN SITS ON THE ON

13
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:18,365
SERVICES COMMITTEE.

14
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:20,334
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

15
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:21,768
>> Shannon: WHAT YOU MAKE OF

16
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:22,469
THIS CHARACTERIZATION, SAYING

17
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:24,071
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE -- FORMER

18
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:26,106
SENATOR AND FORMER SECRETARY

19
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:27,441
GARY IS DOING NOW, WHAT YOU

20
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:29,009
THINK YOU MIGHT >> I DON'T THINK

21
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:30,344
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE ALL.

22
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:31,545
I THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE

23
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:33,180
DEAL AND HOW IT WORKS, WHY IT'S

24
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,716
IMPORTANT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

25
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:37,150
NOT ONLY FOR THE OTHER NATIONS

26
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,319
TO KNOW, BUT CERTAINLY FOR US TO

27
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:39,686
KNOW HERE.

28
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:40,520
IT'S REALLY A DIVERSION.

29
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,223
THE PRESIDENT IN ABOUT 15 HOURS

30
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:44,758
FROM NOW IS GOING TO MAKE AN

31
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:48,729
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DECISION AND

32
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:49,930
AS IT WAS REPORTED EARLIER HERE

33
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,132
ON YOUR SHOW IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

34
00:00:52,132 --> 00:00:54,134
THAT DECISION CAN JUST TORPEDO

35
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:55,802
ALL OF THE EFFORTS TO STOP IRAN

36
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:57,504
FROM BUILDING A NUCLEAR WEAPON,

37
00:00:57,504 --> 00:01:00,540
THAT THEY WILL JUST GO FORWARD.

38
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,174
>> Shannon: OBVIOUSLY THE

39
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:02,776
ADMINISTRATION SEES IT

40
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:03,944
DIFFERENTLY.

41
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:04,711
YOU ACTUALLY SAID IT DOES NEED

42
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:07,514
SOME CHANGES.

43
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:09,116
>> THE ACTUAL DEAL IT WAS ABOUT

44
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:09,683
THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

45
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:11,284
THAT'S WORKING.

46
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:14,521
THE INTERNATIONAL REVIEW, WHAT

47
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:16,623
IS GOING ON IN IRAN, THAT'S

48
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:17,324
TAKING PLACE.

49
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:18,058
WE ARE QUITE CERTAIN THAT THEY

50
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:20,727
ARE DOING NOTHING RIGHT NOW.

51
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:21,762
ISRAEL SAID THEY WERE DOING

52
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:23,130
SOMETHING IN THE PAST YEARS.

53
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:23,530
THAT'S TRUE.

54
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,132
BUT SINCE THIS DEAL HAS BEEN IN

55
00:01:25,132 --> 00:01:27,167
PLACE, THERE HAS BEEN NO FURTHER

56
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:28,502
EFFORT AND IN FACT THEY HAVE

57
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:31,304
ROLLED BACK -- THEY PUT CONCRETE

58
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:32,839
INTO THE NUCLEAR REACTOR SO IT

59
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:34,307
COULDN'T BE USED.

60
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:35,375
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PIECES

61
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,076
TO THIS.

62
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:37,444
THE REST OF THE STORY DEALS WITH

63
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:39,679
WHAT IRAN IS DOING IN THE

64
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:40,113
NEIGHBORHOOD.

65
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:41,715
CLEARLY THEY ARE BAD ACTORS.

66
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:42,816
CLEARLY THEY DO HAVE A BALLISTIC

67
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:45,552
MISSILE EFFORT UNDERWAY, SO WHY

68
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:46,720
DON'T WE DO THIS, WHY DON'T WE

69
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,289
KEEP THE DEAL IN PLACE AS IT

70
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:50,557
EXISTS TODAY AND THEN BUILD ON

71
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,759
IT, USE IT AS A FOUNDATION.

72
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,461
THE NUCLEAR ISSUE, IN PLACE.

73
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:56,530
NOW THEY CAN BUILD ON THE OTHER

74
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,097
PIECES OF THE PUZZLE.

75
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:57,864
THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE THE

76
00:01:57,864 --> 00:02:00,100
WAY TO GO FORWARD.

77
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,768
>> Shannon: I KNOW YOU GET

78
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:02,402
ADDITIONAL BRIEFINGS ABOUT

79
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:03,203
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IRAN BUT

80
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:04,438
ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS THAT

81
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:05,272
EVERYBODY HAS FROM ISRAEL TO

82
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:06,006
PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH THE

83
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,908
DEAL HERE IN THE U.S. IS THE

84
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:10,110
VERIFICATION PROCESS, THIS IDEA

85
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,314
THAT THEY HAVE 21-24 DAYS --

86
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:15,415
WHEN THEY WERE APPROACHED ABOUT

87
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:17,317
AN INSPECTION TO MOVE ON WITH

88
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:17,617
THAT.

89
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:19,553
FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE

90
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:22,155
IAEA, THE AGENCY THAT WATCHES

91
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:26,526
OVER, SAID THIS, A 24 DAY

92
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:27,260
ADJUDICATED TIMELINE REDUCES

93
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,261
DETECTION PROBABILITIES EXACTLY

94
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,697
WHERE THE SYSTEM IS WEAKEST,

95
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:31,465
DETECTING UNDECLARED FACILITIES

96
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:33,166
AND MATERIALS.

97
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,401
ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE A

98
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:35,902
REAL PICTURE OF WHAT IS GOING ON

99
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:37,771
IN IRAN?

100
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:38,738
>> I'M VERY, VERY CONFIDENT.

101
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:39,372
I'M CONFIDENT FOR SEVERAL

102
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:39,739
REASONS.

103
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:41,942
FIRST OF ALL, WHEN YOU ARE

104
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:42,943
MESSING AROUND WITH NUCLEAR

105
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:44,778
MATERIAL YOU LEAVE BEHIND TRACE

106
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:45,345
ELEMENTS AND THOSE ARE

107
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:45,745
DETECTABLE.

108
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:46,379
YOU CAN GET RID OF THEM.

109
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,682
THEY ARE THERE AND THEY ARE NOT

110
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:50,383
GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE HIDDEN.

111
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:51,084
IF SOMEBODY IS DOING SOMETHING

112
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:52,819
IN SOME FACILITY WHICH WE HAVE

113
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:56,957
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE IAEA

114
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:59,559
HAS THE RIGHT TO INSPECT EVERY

115
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,360
FACILITY THAT THEY SUSPECT

116
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,962
SOMETHING IS GOING ON, THAT'S

117
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:03,129
WHERE THE 25 DAYS.

118
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:05,131
IF THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING

119
00:03:05,131 --> 00:03:06,099
THERE THEY HAVE LEFT BEHIND

120
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:08,902
CRITICAL ISOTOPE MARKERS THAT

121
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:11,771
CANNOT BE TAKEN AWAY.

122
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:12,939
YOU SIMPLY SCAN THOSE.

123
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,741
YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING HERE.

124
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,009
NOW THEY ARE IN VIOLATION.

125
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:16,710
AND ALL OF THE SANCTIONS HAVE

126
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,546
WHAT ARE KNOWN AS A SNAP BACK.

127
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:23,517
IF THEY ARE NOT BEING OBEYED, IF

128
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:25,919
THE -- IF IRAN IS ENGAGED IN

129
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,487
SOME SORT OF NEFARIOUS ACTIVITY,

130
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:30,423
THE SANCTIONS IMMEDIATELY SNAP

131
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:30,724
BACK.

132
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:32,359
LET'S BUILD OFF WHAT WE HAVE.

133
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,760
WE'VE GOT A GOOD START ON A

134
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,328
MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE

135
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:35,729
MIDDLE EAST.

136
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:36,963
IRAN WITH A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

137
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:38,164
THEY WILL NOT HAVE ONE FOR A

138
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:39,733
LONG, LONG TIME TO COME, AT

139
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:40,534
LEAST A DECADE, PROBABLY EVEN

140
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,502
LONGER THAN THAT.

141
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:43,370
>> Shannon: THERE ARE MANY

142
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,337
CRITICS WHO DON'T AGREE WITH

143
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:45,005
THAT AND ARE VERY SKEPTICAL.

144
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:48,208
I WANT TO FINISH BY CIRCLING

145
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,077
BACK ON SECRETARY GARY.

146
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:52,078
IF SPECIAL COUNSEL BOB MUELLER

147
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:53,980
IS TRULY INTERESTED IN

148
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,348
INVESTIGATING PEOPLE COLLUDING

149
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:56,917
WITH FOREIGN POWERS, JOHN KERRY

150
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:58,118
SHOULD BE TARGET NUMBER ONE FOR

151
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:01,154
SECRETLY MEETING WITH IRAN -- WE

152
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:02,756
KNOW NOW THAT'S MORE THAN ONE

153
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,724
AND OTHER FOREIGN OFFICIALS IN

154
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:05,725
RECENT WEEKS TO USURP U.S.

155
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:06,192
FOREIGN POLICY.

156
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:07,327
IT GOES ON TO SAY WHAT OTHER

157
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:08,061
DEEP STATE OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN

158
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:11,932
WORKING WITH HIM TO SABOTAGE

159
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:12,632
U.S. FOREIGN INTEREST?

160
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:13,199
CONGRESS MUST OPEN AN

161
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,135
INVESTIGATION TO FIND OUT.

162
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:17,170
A FAILURE TO DO SO WILL REVEAL

163
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,471
JUST HOW PARTISAN AND CORRUPT

164
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:19,539
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS

165
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:20,373
BECOME.

166
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:21,507
>> THAT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEBODY

167
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:22,943
THAT HAD AN AGENDA.

168
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:24,411
I EXPECTED THAT WAS NOT

169
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:26,313
"THE BOSTON GLOBE" EDITORIAL

170
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:26,613
BOARD.

171
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:27,981
IT'S A COLONIST THAT HAS AN

172
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:28,315
AGENDA.

173
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:30,150
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

174
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,152
AB THERE IS SOMETHING THERE.

175
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:32,786
INVESTIGATIONS ARE ALWAYS

176
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:33,553
APPROPRIATE IF THEY ARE BALANCED

177
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:35,322
AND IF THEY ARE JUST AND THEY

178
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:37,958
REALLY GO AFTER THE TRUTH.

179
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,426
THE QUESTION HERE HAPPENS TO BE

180
00:04:39,426 --> 00:00:00,000
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
