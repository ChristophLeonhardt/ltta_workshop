so this is a jackfruit it is the largest fruit to grow on a tree in the world the record is a jackfruit away 154 pounds and this one's kind of a baby but we're now going to open it up so the way you want to do it is just cut straight down the middle but you just cut all the way down the center like this oh my gosh something's heavy you sorta just have to rip it oh that's beautiful look at that ah it actually cut really well it's just cut a slice ah okay this is the edible part you want to try some after peeling it and putting it in bowls or what it looks like kind of looks like uh yeah like little mini peppers on this like yellow onions cut up more like an artichoke would look Oh it's oddly sweet but also kind of rank it looks like it'll be pretty good to be honest so try it out it's really sweet it's kind of like a gummy bear sort of if you're into high chews it tastes like a high chew the consistency is just different it's like tangy but also thick and also sweet there's not as much about like a flavor explosion that you get with a pineapple because just not that juicy I might have I have some more it tastes more like a vegetable than a fruit it's like a pineapple meets a sweet potato which is insane really dude what we have here are three words that never should never pull along together of a BBQ jackfruit taco it looks like it has some guacamole on top with some lettuce and radishes and then you have this BBQ jackfruit that has I mean it looks like pulled pork actually it has the color it has like the little strands that you would think of is pulled pork okay I'm gone in hmmm dude that's good it's amazing how meaty the jackfruit is definitely tasty it also tastes healthy it doesn't really taste like pulled pork but I could believe that it's meat if you didn't tell me that it was jackfruit it also looks like meat I don't understand I would never think that this was a fruit it almost tastes like really thinly ground beef or turkey the seasoning overwhelms the flavor of the jackfruit you know obviously this tastes nothing like the raw fruit but this is like actually good tasting yeah way to go jackfruit this is the best thing I've ever eaten it business insider on video I think we have to credit mother nature for that
