00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:15,000
when they bought Netscape my opinion is

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,980
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> AOL bought Netscape they did it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,450
a specific reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this and the</font>

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,009
reason worked which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was they wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

5
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:21,480
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered the internet blue chip</font>

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,490
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> they wanted to clearly be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,230
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you were an investor or</font>

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,789
if you're an advertiser<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was the</font>

9
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,199
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you would have to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,820
like the GE of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font>

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,920
like the most important company and that

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,269
actually worked so in the wake of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

13
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:35,010
Netscape acquisition a<font color="#CCCCCC"> well stock price</font>

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,540
basically quadrupled over the next you

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,489
know two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years and that put any well in</font>

16
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,519
a position<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy Time Warner and they</font>

17
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:42,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fast and that was</font>

18
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,670
essentially a deliberate<font color="#CCCCCC"> strategy and so</font>

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're focused their focus on Netscape</font>

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">was basically the day after the merger</font>

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,170
they basically stopped worrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

22
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,030
because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were on to the next they</font>

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,809
were on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which to</font>

24
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,909
another good Time Warner merger and so a

25
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,059
well basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netscape what was I mean</font>

26
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,470
SK<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business of Netscape</font>

27
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,470
disintegrated rapidly at that point but

28
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what happens when you sell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

29
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:07,860
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely in that process I</font>

30
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,899
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assumed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that with this tremendous</font>

31
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">success you get very identified</font>

32
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,899
personally with the company it becomes

33
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:14,609
to some extent I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would imagine your</font>

34
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:17,670
identity at what point did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize</font>

35
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,590
there was gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> be life after Netscape</font>

36
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,170
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> date</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we sold it I mean I was</font>

37
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,119
I was I was probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as emotional as</font>

38
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,530
I even even should have been on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but</font>

39
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,659
it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> if my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view on it was kind of</font>

40
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,859
pragmatic which was if you sell your

41
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:30,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">company then the buyer gets to do</font>

42
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,289
whatever they want with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you have</font>

43
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">to in my opinion you have to emotionally</font>

44
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:34,259
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from it at that point cuz</font>

45
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">otherwise you're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to torture</font>

46
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:37,499
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and has it been painful to</font>

47
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:38,429
watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> it disintegrate</font>

48
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:40,530
well painful in a I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say in a</font>

49
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">painful in the sense of I mean it not</font>

50
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,850
particularly like fun to watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> but like</font>

51
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,679
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I assumed that it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

52
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:47,759
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they were gonna do</font>

53
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,810
whatever they did with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I wasn't</font>

54
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna like get emotionally wrapped up in</font>

55
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:51,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">it because I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have no control over</font>

it
