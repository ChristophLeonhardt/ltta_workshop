1
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,840
This is Rosario, the third largest city in Argentina.

2
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,180
Beautiful, historic, right on the water, the revolutionary leader Che Guevara and national soccer star Lionel Messi are both from here.

3
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,720
But as you get away from the center of town, another side of the city reveals itself.

4
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,920
On the outskirts, in the slums known as villas, Rosario is beset with poverty and crime.

5
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,880
In recent years, drug use has not only grown among the population of 1.2 million,

6
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,040
but it has also spawned an extremely violent drug war that is little known outside of Argentina.

7
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,140
Rosario is not Mexico or Colombia when it comes to its local drug conflict,

8
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,600
but let's not forget that the wars that we're familiar with in Mexico and Colombia also began like this

9
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,660
drug gangs fighting over territory at gunpoint

10
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,640
often times are not accustomed to such levels of violence

11
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:55,880
That's why we're here, to understand why violence is on the rise in Rosario and to find out what the authorities are doing about it.

12
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,060
Right now, the villas and barrios of Rosario are the battlegrounds in a mafia turf struggle

13
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,360
that almost sounds like something from the Sopranos

14
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,460
The main drug trafficking gang in Rosario is the group known as

15
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,360
Los Monos, which means "the monkeys."

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,960
This is a tight-knit organization led by the Cantero family

17
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,060
Ariel "M치ximo" Cantero is their founding leader

18
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,760
and Claudio "El P치jaro" Cantero and Ram칩n "El Monchi" Machuca

19
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,900
are the main operators

20
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:29,860
Rival drug lords have shot one another down, resulting in a spiral of unchecked violence that has left hundreds dead

21
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,760
Between 2011 and 2014, more than 570 people have been killed

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,520
Making Rosario's homicidal 5 times higher than the that of the rest of Argentina

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:47,660
The situation got so bad that earlier this year, Argentina's government sent in its militarized police force,

24
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,220
the Gendarmerie, to patrol the streets of Rosario's villas

25
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,100
We linked up with a Gendarmerie patrol into one of the villas

26
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,760
We are hereby warned, what happens from here on out is our responsibility

27
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,520
So we're looking at a new reality here in Rosario

28
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:12,720
the use of spontaneous, unannounced checkpoints where residents, civilians, in their vehicles,

29
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,540
are stopped, their vehicles are searched, this looks like

30
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,400
a situation that reflects a climate in which this has become necessary in Rosario

31
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,680
Rosario is located about 300 miles northwest of the capital of Buenos Aires

32
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
in the province of Santa Fe

33
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,600
Rosario sits on a critical highway leading to the porous borders with cocaine-producing Bolivia

34
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,660
and marijuana-producing Paraguay

35
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,320
It's a wonder Argentina hadn't developed profile as a drug trafficking nation much earlier

36
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,300
the country has considerable maritime capacity

37
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,580
with several ports on the Atlantic ocean

38
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,200
connecting it to Europe and the ever-growing global drug market

39
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,240
Drug gangs across the city set up shop literally opening up drug distribution points known as bunkers

40
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
These are safe houses or small fortified rooms in which marijuana and cocaine are sold to customers through a tiny service window

41
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,440
as if they were drive-through fast food joints

42
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,420
The dealers had to be able to work long shifts without being able to exit the bunker

43
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,740
Two doors down from the "drug store" that was shut down, there is a handwritten sign on this front door saying,

44
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,800
"This is not the bunker, this is a family's home"

45
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,980
They have to put signs on their doors literally telling people that drugs are not for sale here

46
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,260
go two doors down

47
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,600
Claudio Ber칩n is a police reporter working for La Capital

48
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,120
one of the main newspapers in Rosario

49
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,020
Some gangsters kill each other and some others end up in jail

50
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,000
and when they go to jail, they call Carlos Varela

51
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,700
He is the attorney who represents the most dangerous assassins and drug traffickers in Rosario

52
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,460
He also represents members of the Cantero family

53
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
We're here in downtown Buenos Aires

54
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:31,640
about to meet Sergio Berni, the secretary of security in the cabinet of president Cristina Hernandez de Kirchner

55
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:39,720
Secretary Berni is going to give us a wider vision of what is happening today with the drug trade and with narco traffic at large

56
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:51,360
Berni is a lieutenant colonel in Argentina's army, he's a surgeon, master diver, alpine climber, and unabashed enthusiast of President Cristina Hernandez de Kirchner

57
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,760
He is currently the man running the show on anti-drug operations in Argentina

58
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,280
The commercial activity that gangs carried out shifted with the growing drug market in Rosario

59
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,460
Their profits grew and ultimately so did the violence on the streets

60
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,180
Gangs began hiring assassins to carry out hits against their enemies

61
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,760
and so people began killing on request

62
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,860
This made murder another good business in Rosario

63
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:27,060
So we made a connect and we are on our way right now to meet a sicario, a paid assassin working here in Rosario

64
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,600
What is happening now in Rosario?

65
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,400
Why this sudden increase in violence crime?

66
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,000
How much do you charge to do a job?

67
00:12:04,180 --> 00:00:00,000
How many people have you killed?
