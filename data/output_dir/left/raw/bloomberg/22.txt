1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,380
Golden temples, beautiful beaches, bustling night markets.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,320
Thailand has long been a world-famous tourist destination.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,660
It’s expecting a record number of 40 million visitors in 2019 -

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,660
well over half the country’s population.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,940
And it’s dependent on tourist dollars -

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,600
it accounts for about 20% of GDP.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,640
But the industry barely existed before 1960.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,880
Its origins were in fact born out of a dark passage of American history.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,680
Here’s how war made Thailand a tourist destination.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,940
The Vietnam War saw over 3 million American soldiers sent to South East Asia.

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,380
Many would be stationed in Thailand,

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,640
which became a major ally in the region and home to seven US air bases.

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,300
At the height of the conflict, some 50,000 military personnel were stationed throughout Thailand.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,880
As America’s involvement in Vietnam deepened,

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,840
more resources were pumped into the support network in Thailand.

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,099
As well as building highways and ports, the US sent aid for other infrastructure and social projects,

17
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,980
aiming to improve living standards and combat the spread of communism.

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,660
All the while, Thailand’s capital Bangkok became a centre for air travel,

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,100
as international airlines found it a convenient location to refuel.

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,060
It was here in Bangkok where many American soldiers headed for Rest and Recuperation, or ‘R and R’ days.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,580
Thousands of coloured neon signs proclaim the city’s bars, bathhouses, massage parlours,

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,100
and dozens of luxurious night clubs, each with its pretty Thai hostesses.

23
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,240
The notorious red-light districts were hard to resist

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,260
for soldiers who had spent months enduring the terror of the jungle.

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,280
And US soldiers were also big spenders,

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,920
handing over almost $11 million in 1967.

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,380
That’s around 22% of total expenditure by foreign visitors.

28
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,080
And as the numbers of soldiers and other visitors

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,080
began to rise, tourism infrastructure increased too.

30
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,640
Plush air-conditioned hotels abound

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,300
and new shoebox style office buildings

32
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,820
dominate the skyline in a helter skelter transformation

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,480
of what was once a sedate oriental port.

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,300
As the war ended in 1975,

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,800
the number of tourists dropped - but only briefly -

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,080
the industry would go

37
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,540
from strength to strength in the following decades.

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,840
The infrastructure built for U.S. soldiers and businesses -

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,880
at a cost of over $1.6 billion in military and aid spending-

40
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,320
created the foundation for today’s Thai tourism industry.

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,340
In 2018, Thailand is expected to make $63 billion from tourism.

42
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
But Americans are no longer the big spenders anymore,

43
00:02:40,600 --> 00:00:00,000
another superpower has taken that title – the Chinese.
