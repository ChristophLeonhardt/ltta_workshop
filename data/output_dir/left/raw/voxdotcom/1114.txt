1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,250


2
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:05,155
"Thirty inches of rain ahead."

3
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:08,355


4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,840
"Could climate change be fueling 

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,300
the history-making nature of this storm?"

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,180
We know that humanity's carbon footprint

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,600
has shifted the baseline conditions of the climate,

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,140
the context in which every weather event takes place.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,340
But trying to isolate the human influence

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,960
from everything else that is going on can be really hard,

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,260
especially for hurricanes, or what scientists

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,020
call "tropical cyclones."

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,119
They're super complex and the quality of

14
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,460
the historical data we have for them isn't great.

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,920
We do have physics, though.

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
Hurricanes are driven by

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,580
the transfer of heat from the sea to the air 

18
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,000
through evaporation.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,140
The storm's maximum possible wind speed,

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,900
or its potential intensity,

21
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,060
depends in part on how warm the ocean is

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,400
And of course, we're warming the ocean.

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,140
So researchers expect intense tropical cyclones

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,200
to become frequent if we continue to warm the planet.

25
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,320
"That's one place I think you'd find a very

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,440
strong consensus among scientists who

27
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,500
study the connection between hurricanes and climate,

28
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,360
that the frequency of the high-end events

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,540
will probably go up."

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,740
And that shows up in climate models.

31
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,560
This is from the

32
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,640
intergovernmental panel on climate change

33
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,600
It summarizes the computer model results

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,620
for tropical cyclones near the end of this century,

35
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,040
compared to today.

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,040
The first bar represents

37
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,680
the total number of tropical cyclones globally.

38
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,460
That's projected to go down a bit.

39
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,900
But the second bar represents the 

40
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,820
frequency of the most intense storms,

41
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,720
categories four and five,

42
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,020
and the models show those increasing

43
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,460
And that's bad news because those are

44
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,220
the storms that cause the most damage

45
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,000
and the biggest loss of life.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,960
Now when they try to look at specific regions,

47
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,220
it gets really messy.

48
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,660
In the North Atlantic, for example,

49
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,100
the models show category four and five storms

50
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,120
maybe increasing by 200%

51
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,420
or maybe decreasing by 100%.

52
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,220
So, yeah, the resolution of their simulations

53
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,200
just isn't fine enough yet to give us

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,800
good regional projections,

55
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,220
even if they expect more intense storms globally.

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,960
But there's another really clear consistent result here

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,420
- this fourth bar, it represents the amount of rain

58
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,080
that hurricanes will bring and that's going up.

59
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,800
Not just for our Atlantic coast,

60
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,080
but for the Pacific coast of North America,

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,139
the western Pacific, the south Pacific,

62
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,140
and the Indian Ocean,

63
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,980
everywhere.

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,700
The hurricanes of the future will be wetter.

65
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,260
So coastal cities will face

66
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,180
freshwater flooding from the sky

67
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,080
paired with storm surge from the sea,

68
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,580
which is higher now

69
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,300
because we are also causing sea levels to rise.

70
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,340
And that trend of wetter storms isn't just for hurricanes.

71
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,040
Heavy precipitation events from other types of storms

72
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,940
have been increasing in The US

73
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,420
and should continue to increase across the country.

74
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,680
Even in places that might see

75
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,600
less rain over the whole year,

76
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,155
they'll get more days with really heavy precipitation.

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,220
This comes down to basic physics too:

78
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,420
warmer air can take up more water

79
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,640
before it dumps it back down on us.

80
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,900
All of this means global warming worsens floods

81
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,760
like the kind that hit Houston,

82
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,980
but it's not our destiny to hurt ourselves like this.

83
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,180
It depends on what we choose to do now.

84
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,880
We could rethink our infrastructure and regulations

85
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,520
to minimize the damage,

86
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,100
but unless we also start cutting our carbon emissions

87
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,340
and shifting the world to clean energy,

88
00:03:05,340 --> 00:00:00,000
it's just going to get worse.
