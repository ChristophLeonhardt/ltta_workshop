00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,271
THE SELF-DRIVING CARS.

3
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:04,938
BRIAN: IT PUTS DRIVERS OUT

4
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:05,673

NEWT, WOULD YOU EVER GET IN

13
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,819

14
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,021
>> SURE, IN FACT, I WENT OUT

GOOGLE'S DRIVERLESS CAR AND

18
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,263
IT WAS FASCINATING.

19
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,330
BRIAN: DID YOU SURVIVE?

20
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,465

PARTICULARLY THEY ARE SAFER

23
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:35,769
THAN DRIVERS.

24
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,137
IF YOU ARE OUT LATE AT NIGHT

25
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:37,971

00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:42,509
AINSLEY: GOOD POINT.

30
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,510
>> OR DRIVERLESS CAR.

31
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,878
TAKE THE DRIVERLESS CAR.

32
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,014
IT'S SAFER.

33
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:48,882
BRIAN: WHAT ABOUT A

34
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,283
SKATEBOARD?

35
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,519
[LAUGHTER]

36
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,320
BRIAN: THOSE ARE YOUR ONLY

00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,556
TWO CHOICES.

THE HIGH STAKES NEGOTIATIONS

44
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:03,297
WITH NORTH KOREA.

45
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,599
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

46
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,301
>> WELL, I THINK, FIRST OF

47
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,936
ALL, WE ARE REALLY GAINING

48
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,905
MOMENTUM AND THE REPORT BY

49
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,875
THE RESERVE THAT WE MIGHT BE

50
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,677
AT 4.1% ECONOMIC GROWTH THIS

51
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:17,478
QUARTER.

52
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:18,278
THAT -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

53
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,680
PROBLEMS IN EUROPE AND IN

54
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,315
JAPAN, AND ELSEWHERE.

55
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,784
HAVING AMERICA BACK WITH JOB

56
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,253
CREATION, HAVING US BACK

57
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,354
WITH EXPLORATION IN SPACE.

58
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,156
HAVING US REBUILDING OUR

59
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,457
MILITARY, ALL THOSE THINGS

60
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,526
GIVE US MUSCLE IN THE

61
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:33,093
INTERNATIONAL ARENA.

62
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,230
AND I THINK THE FIRM

63
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,598
TOUGHNESS, ACTUALLY I

64
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,799
THOUGHT SECRETARY OF STATE

65
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,269
POMPEO'S SPEECH ABOUT IRAN

66
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:42,703
KOREA.

67
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,204
IT IS A VERY TOUGH SPEECH.

68
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,405
AND SAYS TO THE IRANIANS

69
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,640
HERE ARE THE BAD THINGS THAT

70
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,942
CAN HAPPEN TO YOU IF YOU

71
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,344
DON'T FALL IN LINE.

72
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,846
WELL, IN A SENSE, IF YOU ARE

73
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:53,747
KIM JONG UN AND YOU ARE

74
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:54,982
LOOKING AT THAT SPEECH, YOU

75
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,950
ARE THINKING OH YEAH, THAT

76
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,018
COULD APPLY TO ME, TOO.

77
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,787
I THINK THE PRESIDENT SO FAR

78
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:04,658
HAS BASICALLY DONE PRETTY

79
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:05,492
GOOD JOB.

80
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,562
THE NORTH KOREANS FOR YEARS

81
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,163
GOT A DEAL, TOOK THE MONEY

82
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:16,703
AND BROKE THEIR WORD.

83
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:17,704
WE WILL KEEP ALL THE

84
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:18,739
SANCTIONS ON UNTIL WE CAN

85
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,040
VERIFY THAT YOU ARE DOING

86
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,444
THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

87
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:24,912
DONE.

88
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:25,879
FRANKLY THE SOUTH KOREANS

89
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,381
ARE BEGGING THE NORTH

90
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:32,920
KOREANS TO CUT A DEAL.

91
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,521
SOUTH KOREAS ARE VERY

92
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,191
WORRIED ABOUT THE DANGERS OF

93
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,225
A REAL WAR DANGEROUS FOR

94
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:38,725
SOUTH KOREA.

95
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,860
THEY ARE DRAWING KIM JONG

96
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,127
UN.

97
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,395
YOU WILL NOTICE HE WENT FOR

98
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,429
A SURPRISE SUMMIT MEETING

99
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,430
OVER THE WEEKEND WITH THE

100
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,865
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA.

101
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,633
SENT BACK THE WORD OH, YEAH.

102
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,702
I REALLY DO WANT TO MEET,

103
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,671
SORRY YOU FELT BAD ABOUT IT.

104
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,373
AND, THEY HAVE TEAMS NOW

105
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,175
WORKING IN SINGAPORE, THEY

106
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,913
APPARENTLY HAVE A TEAM

107
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,584
MEETING MEETING IN NEW YORK.

108
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,553
NOT GOING TO BE A MAGIC

109
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,221
MOMENT KIM JONG UN DECIDES

110
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:08,655
TO GIVE UP ALL OF HIS

111
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,489
NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN RETURN

112
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,291
FOR A VISIT TO MAR-A-LAGO OR

113
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,193
A PROMISE BY TRUMP TO OPEN

114
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,029
UP THREE GOLF COURSES.

115
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,300
I MEAN THESE GUYS ARE TOUGH.

116
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,468
THEY SPENT THREE GENERATIONS

117
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,502
GOING THROUGH TERRIBLE

118
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,103
CIRCUMSTANCES TRYING TO

119
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:23,804
BUILD THESE WEAPONS.

120
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,272
AND IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY

121
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:26,406
TOUGH GETTING THEM TO GIVE

122
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,608
THEM UP.

123
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,243
BRIAN: SO IT'S JUNE 12TH

124
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:29,943
HAPPENS, IT'S ONLY GOING TO

125
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:30,811
BE THE START.

126
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:31,645
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WALK

127
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,512
OUT WITH A DEAL.

128
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,647
I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN

129
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,516
THE MIND SET -- SHOULD BE

130
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,988
THE MIND SET GOING IN,

131
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,823
CORRECT?

132
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,559
THE

133
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:45,592
MIE

134
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,895
MIND SET.

135
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,129
TOUGHEN THEM UNLESS THEY ARE

136
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,998
BEING REASONABLE.

137
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:54,101
REAGAN USED TO SAY OLD

138
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:54,568
VERIFY.

139
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,969
THESE GUYS HAVE SUCH A

140
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:56,637
TERRIBLE RECORD.

141
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:57,971
THE PHRASE IS MISTRUST AND

142
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,473
VERIFY, VERIFY, VERIFY.

143
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,442
BECAUSE YOU JUST HAVE TO

144
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,279
ASSUME THAT THEIR TRACK

145
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,346
RECORD IS SUCH THEY ARE

146
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,015
GOING TO TRY TO GET OUT OF

147
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,150
DOING ANYTHING REAL.

148
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,118
PETE: HAS BEEN UNDER SIEGE

149
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,585
AT HOME.

150
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,086
AS YOU OFTEN DO YOU

151
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:13,954
DISSECTED WHAT HE IS FACING

152
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:14,888
IN THE MUELLER PROBE.

153
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,555
YOU SAY IT'S NOT ONE

154
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:16,890
SCANDAL.

155
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,492
IT'S ACTUALLY FIVE SCANDALS.

156
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:19,326
DISSECT THAT FOR US.

157
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,894
WILL YOU?

158
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:21,628
>> YEAH.

159
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,931
I ACTUALLY WROTE A PIECE --

160
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,333
A NEWSLETTER BOTH FOR

161
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,468
GINGRICH PRODUCTIONS AND

162
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,536
POSTED @FOXNEWS.COM.

163
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:30,470
THE CHALLENGE HAVE YOU GOT

164
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,805
IS YOU ORIGINALLY HAVE THE

165
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:32,940
CLINTON SCANDALS GOING ALL

166
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,408
THE WAY BACK TO CATTLE

167
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,344
FUTURE IN 1978 WHEN SHE MADE

168
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,413
$98,000 ON A $1,000

169
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:40,514
INVESTMENT WHICH IS CLEARLY

170
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,515
JUST CALLED FRAUD.

171
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,417
BUT THE CLINTONS HAVE HAD

172
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,484
SCANDALS THEIR WHOLE CAREER.

173
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,688
THEN YOU HAVE THE SCANDAL OF

174
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,256
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

175
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,090
DEEP STATE COVERING UP FOR

176
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,758
THE CLINTONS, OFFERING

177
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,125
IMMUNITY.

178
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,460
YOU KNOW, IMAGINE, THIS GUY

179
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,728
BLEACH BITS THE COMPUTER SO

180
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,496
THEY GIVE HIM IMMUNITY?

181
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,965
THEY DON'T CHARGE EITHER OF

182
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:58,899
HER TOP STAFF PEOPLE?

183
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,300
I MEAN, LOOK AT HOW THEY

184
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,668
TREAT THE TRUMP PEOPLE.

185
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:02,803
LOOK AT HOW THEY TREATED THE

186
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,770
HILLARY CLINTON PEOPLE.

187
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,906
THEN, THIRD, YOU HAVE THE

188
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,275
SCANDAL OF A TOTALLY FALSE,

189
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:11,078
WE'RE NOW LEARNING VERY LONG

190
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,579
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION EFFORT

191
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,947
TO DESTROY TRUMP THROUGH A

192
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,615
VARIETY OF INVESTIGATIONS.

193
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,085
AND I'M CONVINCED IT GOES UP

194
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:18,919
TO VALERIE JARRETT AND TO

195
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:19,486
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

196
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,021
YOU COULDN'T HAVE HAD THIS

197
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,489
SCALE OF ACTIVITY ON THAT

198
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,724
FRONT.

199
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,493
THEN, FOURTH, YOU HAVE THE

200
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,794
SCANDAL OF THE FBI ITSELF

201
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:28,462
BREAKING DOWN.

202
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:31,431
WE NOW HAVE HAD THE TOP GUY

203
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:31,765
RESIGN.

204
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,033
WE HAVE HAD THE NUMBER TWO

205
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:33,633
GUY RESIGN.

206
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,769
BOTH OF THEM MAY WELL FACE

207
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:36,303
CRIMINAL CHARGES.

208
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,671
YOU HAD SEVERAL OTHER TOP

209
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,606
PEOPLE HAD TO RESIGN OR

210
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:39,940
RETIRE.

211
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,508
ALL OF THAT TIES BACK INTO

212
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,276
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND

213
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,011
THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE.

214
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,479
AND THEN FINALLY, YOU'RE

215
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,647
BEGINNING TO SEE SOME PEOPLE

216
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,616
LIKE GENERAL CLAPPER KIND OF

217
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,584
MELT DOWN BECAUSE I THINK

218
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,086
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FOLKS

219
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,121
WHO THOUGHT THEY COULD GO

220
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,288
AHEAD AND DO WHATEVER THEY

221
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,757
WANTED TO BECAUSE HILLARY

222
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:02,896
WOULD COVER IT UP.

223
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,431
IT'S GRADUALLY SINKING IT

224
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,365
THEY MIGHT BE VULNERABLE AND

225
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,767
I LOOK AT THE CIA DIRECTOR

226
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,769
AND THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF

227
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:09,436
INTELLIGENCE, YOU KNOW, TWO

228
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,405
OF THE GOOD EXAMPLES OF

229
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:14,074
PEOPLE WHO REALLY WENT OVER

230
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,409
THE LINE ASSUMING THEY WOULD

231
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,877
BE PROTECTED AND NOW THEY

232
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,478
COULD BE FACED WITH SERIOUS

233
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,580
CHARGES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.

234
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,481
BRIAN: BOTH GUYS WHO ARE

235
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,283
KNOWN TO HAVE TO VERIFY

236
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,317
INTELLIGENCE AND COME OUT

237
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,385
WITH VERY LEARNED OPINIONS

238
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,588
HAVE SAID WELL, I THINK THAT

239
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,957
PUTIN HAS BEEN HAS

240
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,359
COMPROMISED TRUMP AND

241
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,593
CLAPPER THINKS RUSSIA THREW

242
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,294
THE ELECTION.

243
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,262
I'M JUST SAYING THAT EVEN

244
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,096
THOUGH THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T

245
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,831
POINT TO THAT TOTALLY

246
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:38,265
IRRESPONSIBLE.

247
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,699
THEY ARE ACTING LIKE GUILTY

248
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,033
PEOPLE.

249
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:40,600
NEWT, THANKS SO MUCH.

250
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,803
I CANNOT WAIT FOR YOUR BOOK.

251
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,271
>> WELL, LOOK, I HAVE TO

252
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,806
TELL YOU, THE BREAKING POINT

253
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,174
FOR ME WAS THE INTERVIEW

254
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,408
CLAPPER DID WHERE HE SAID HE

255
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,310
HATED TO USE THE WORD SPY.

256
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,611
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

257
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,047
THIS GUY WAS THE DIRECTOR OF

258
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:54,681
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE.

259
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,282
AINSLEY: I KNOW, RIGHT.

260
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,117
>> HE WAS THEORETICALLY IN

261
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,985
CHARGE OF ALL OF OUR SPIES

262
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,153
THAT WOULD BE LIKE HAVING A

263
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,922
GUY WHO IS A BAR KEEPER WHO

264
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:02,756
DOESN'T LIKE ALCOHOL AND

265
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,059
REFUSES TO SERVE IT I MEAN,

266
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,094
JUST CHALLENGING HOW SCREWED

267
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,328
UP THESE GUYS ARE GETTING AS

268
00:07:08,328 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY FACE A WORLD THEY NEVER
