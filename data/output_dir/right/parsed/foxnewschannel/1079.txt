>> SOLVED BY MANY OTHERS.
I'M NOT JUST SAYING
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
I'M SAYING OTHER PRESIDENTS.
LONG TIME AGO THIS COULD
HAVE BEEN SOLVED IN A LOT
EASIER MANNER.
AND A LOT LESS DANGEROUS
MANNER.
BUT IT WASN'T, SO I WILL
SOLVE IT.
BRIAN: THERE WAS A SENSE
THAT THINGS WERE GETTING
CLOSE IN THE PAST BUT 70
YEARS LATER WE STILL DON'T
HAVE A DEAL.
WILL WE GET A DEAL NOW.
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP GETS
READY FOR THE SUMMIT WITH
KING NEXT WEEK IT APPEARS
OTHER GLOBAL PLAYERS ARE
TRYING TO GET IN THE ACTION.
LOOK AT THIS ROSTER HERE.
HERE TO BREAK IT DOWN SENIOR
FELLOW FOR THE DEFENSE OF
DEMOCRACY.
ANTHONY SPENT YEARS WORKING
ON NONPROLIFERATION AT THE
STATE DEPARTMENT NOT EASY.
LET'S MAKE SENSE OF IT.
ANTHONY, THANKS SO MUCH.
HERE ARE THE PLAYERS.
LET'S GET STARTED.
FIRST GUY WE WANT TO TAKE A
LOOK AT.
LEADERRED OF SOUTH KOREA.
WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT
HIM?
>> I THINK PRESIDENT MOON
WANTS THE TALKS TO CONTINUE
WITH KIM.
HE HAS ALREADY MET KIM
TWICE.
THERE IS RUMORS THAT MOON
MAY JOIN THE SUMMIT ON THE
SECOND DAY IF THERE IS
ANYTHING ON THE PEACE
TREATY.
BRIAN: ARE OUR OBJECTIVES
THE SAME?
>> FOR THE MOST PART.
ALTHOUGH MOON WANTS THE
INTERKOREAN SUMMIT IN THE
WORST WAY.
HE MAY FORCE TRUMP TO TRY TO
GET A BAD DEAL.
BRIAN: THIS IS THE WHOLE
DEAL HE HAD.
HE IS CONSIDERED MORE
LIBERAL.
REPLACED A CONSERVATIVE.
JAPAN SHINZO ABE, WHAT DOES
HE WANT?
>> TWO THINGS HE WANTS IS A
MISSILE DEAL AND ON
ABDUCTEES.
>> TO REMOVE ALL?
>> TO HAVE THE ABDUCTEES
COME BACK.
I THINK HE IS WORRIED THAT
THE UNITED STATES WILL GET A
LONG RANGE MISSILE DEAL AND
NOT FOCUS ON THE MISSILES
THAT ARE TARGETED AT JAPAN.
BRIAN: DOES HE WANT OUR
TROOPS TO STAY.
>> YES, DEFINITELY.
BRIAN: 38,000?
>> IN SOUTH KOREA AND TROOPS
IN JAPAN AS WELL INCLUDING
AIRCRAFT CARRIER.
BRIAN: CHINA, WHAT DO THEY
WANT?
THIS IS THEIR ALLY THEY WANT
TO KEEP IT COMMUNIST.
>> OVERALL THE CHINESE WANT
THE U.S. OUT OF EAST ASIA
BUT REDUCE TRUMP'S LEVERAGE
IN THE TALKS.
BRIAN: HOW DOES TRUMP'S
LEVERAGE GET REDUCED IN THE
TALKS?
>> THEY ARE ALLOWING THE
SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH
KOREA TO BE LOOSENED BY
CHINA.
BRIAN: OVER THE LAST COUPLE
OF MONTHS?
>> OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF
MONTHS.
BRIAN: WE HAVE SANCTIONS
READY TO GO.
NOW, OUT OF NOWHERE, LAVROV
GOES TO VISIT.
VLADIMIR PUTIN PROMISES A
SUMMIT.
WHAT DOES HE WANT?
>> YEAH, I MEAN THE RUSSIANS
HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST
SANCTION BUSTERS IN THE ERA
OF MAXIMUM PRESSURE.
THEY WANT TO PLAY A SPOILER
ROLE.
THEY ALSO WANT THE UNITED
STATES OUT OF EAST ASIA.
BRIAN: I JUST WOULD SAY
THIS.
I THINK IN ONE WAY THEY AND
CHINA ENJOYED BEING THE ONLY
ALLIES IN THE AREA.
THEY JUST DON'T LIKE THE
