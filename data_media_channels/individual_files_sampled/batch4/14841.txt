perhaps the toughest business in the world is the restaurant business high operating costs high staffing to us a fickle public to deal with it's so so hard to make a buck but in Quebec it just got that much harder for restaurant owners thanks to a stupefying ruling from that provinces labor tribunal well if you're like me folks when you scrape up enough dough to dine out you really want good food and friendly service that's what we like big beautiful smiles what we don't want is the kind of surly attitude Jack Nicholson experienced at that diner in five Easy Pieces okay I'll make it as easy for you as I can I'd like an omelet plain and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast no mayonnaise no butter no lettuce and a cup of coffee number two chicken sauce and Ola butter the lettuce the mayonnaise and a cup of coffee anything else yeah now all you have to do is hold the chicken bring me the toast give me a check for the chicken salad sandwich and you haven't broken any rules you want me to hold the chicken huh yeah who wants a croman of a waitress like that oh but the bureaucrats in Quebec who like bureaucrats everywhere they never smile why should they they're bureaucrats after all but apparently they think this sort of attitude should be accommodated in the private sector too here's the deal Carolyn de neige a waitress working at the Coco frutti restaurant in Victoriaville Quebec gee what a name coco fruity was dismissed for allegedly having a bad attitude and not smiling enough Hey the restaurant business a people business if you can't offer service with a smile maybe it shouldn't be interacting with the public in the first place but after being acts de neige went crying to quebec's labor tribunal and guess what not only did the tribunal order the restaurant to reinstate her but she was also awarded $30,000 in damages that's a lot of chicken salad sandwiches for her parte de neige claims she was in a dispute with management over back pay the owner insisted that she was also let go because of quote her bad attitude and for not smiling enough end quote the owner all so noted that quote everyone had problems with her end quote now granted there's a bit of a he-said she-said dynamic at play here but regardless tribunal judge Kristian drool a didn't recognize the restaurants bad attitude no smiling excuses being serious and that's where I take issue with drool a who has never likely managed a restaurant himself for if the restaurateur is telling the truth here a waiter or waitress that has bad attitude and doesn't smile is very toxic indeed an eatery can have the best decor the most delicious food but if the service is harsh that can mean a death sentence for a restaurant you know once upon a time I worked for a food service trade magazine I was doing a story on the labor front and they interviewed the then CEO of the Red Lobster and Olive Garden chains in Canada billed over I asked bill why the waitstaff at his restaurants were always so friendly he told me it had to do with the company's HR process in the preliminary hiring stage which is to say if a job seeker isn't smiling during the job interview his or her resume goes right into the garbage can regardless of how much experience the candidate has as he remarked to me we can teach our staff so many things but you can't teach someone how to smile alas the Quebec labor tribunal sees things differently and they found in de nays favor of course now the back pay issue may have been legitimate but setting this one case aside think of all the other restaurants this could set a precedent for if a server with a poor attitude isn't deemed grounds for firing that employee too bad for the paying customers and too bad so sad for the restaurant owner who must now thanks to government edik accommodate those who offer service with a snarl for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a rebel premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
