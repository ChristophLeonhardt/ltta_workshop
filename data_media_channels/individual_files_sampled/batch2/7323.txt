the Justice Department released the five memos that James Comey had written in regard to the meetings he had with Donald Trump when he was the FBI director those memos were then given to Congress and then immediately leaked so we now know what the memo said and we have highlighted some of the more relevant or interesting parts of those memos for you so here we go out of the five meetings between the two Trump brought up Russian prostitutes on three occasions mm-hmm so it's interesting that he kept bringing up the prostitutes especially when you think of the steel dossier and some of the more salacious components of that dossier and how he pushed back against that so aggressively he seems pretty obsessed with the prostitutes issue this is according to the memo the president brought up the golden showers thing and said it really bothered him if his wife had any doubt about it he then explained as he did at our dinner that he hadn't stayed overnight in Russia during the Miss Universe trip so can I jump in to break down a couple of things so James Comey when he was writing those memos the quote that you just heard he had not been fired yet at that point he doesn't necessarily have any beef with Donald Trump and so what he did was he has meetings with Donald Trump and right afterwards he writes down his notes of what happened so he writes these things and you could tell in the reading of the memos kind of mystified like he brought up the gulp quote-unquote golden showers thing in another meeting he's like he brought up two prostitutes again telling me about how a lot of more Putin thinks there's beautiful Russian hookers Trump is voluntarily constantly bringing this up to come me who was puzzled by it but at that point they don't have a beef didn't he hasn't been fired or anything like that so that context is really important and and also they let's be fair Donald Trump this steel dossier mentioned that he was with Russian prostitutes and there was the peeing on the the bed that the Obamas had stayed and that is the allegations and that the Russians had tape of it so Trump is not bringing up Russian prostitutes out of thin air it's not like hey how you doing how was your tuna sandwich let me tell you about Russian process okay so there is that context on the other hand if someone had accused me of that and it was preposterous I don't know that I would be happy after meeting like now let me tell you something about how I was not with Russian hookers so that's important right it also you have to take into account the context in which these conversations are taking place because again it's in the context of possible Russian interfere in an interfere Minh tin into our elections right interfering in our elections and so it's weird that something as serious is that or potentially serious is that is not what's concerning Trump it's more the salacious prostitute thing but but I think that's where he's just the most comfortable I mean I I think his whole MO is to really divert anyone from anything of any importance or not not that Russian prostitutes might not have importance because they clearly do to him but but to kind of divert attention and sort of I think you know calculating even though nothing was going on in his mind yet perhaps regarding what Comey would do later kind of still trying to steer the conversation in a way that maybe kept him off-guard of things that are more important possibly than Russian prostitute but let's also keep it real right the only thing Donald Trump cares about is Donald Trump so if I mean one he's looking to protect himself of course right but but number two even if he hadn't done anything with the Russians and there was no collusion at all and there was no tape and there was no or anything he still wouldn't have cared about Russian interference in the election unless it went against him and then he would have cared a lot right but it wound up helping him so he's like hey I don't think it even crossed his mind that he was supposed to tell the FBI director hey let's make sure they don't interfere in our democracy again right I don't think it even occurred to him what but he brought that up apparently zero times he brought up Russian ogres three times you go with what you know and just one more quick part of the memo in regard to his obsession with the hookers the president according to the memo said the hookers thing is nonsense but that Putin had told him quote we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world so I again I I don't know why the conversation kept going to the hookers but it did and so Comey outlined it in all of these different memos and now we know exactly what he wrote in those memos so that's relevant actually for another reason because Trump claims that he never talked to Putin until he became president exactly now in an official meeting with him as president of the United States did Vlad out of nowhere and be like I gotta tell you something Donald like congratulations on being elected plus we've got amazing hookers in Russia so it seems to indicate that Trump and Putin had an earlier conversation that Trump has covered up and yet another lie by the way the first ball had another trump lie where he said that he left that night even before staying so meaning like I wasn't even in that hotel because I'd already left there are other people who were on that trip saying no he did not leave he stayed in Russia so now let's get to what Trump had told Comey in regard to reporters who he was getting frustrated with now as we know during the Trump administration there have been a number of leaks it's like every week we get another huge leak from people who are very close to the president and he wants to know who those sources are who is talking to the press and here's what he allegedly told Comey Trump replied that we need to go after the reporters and refer to the fact that 10 or 15 years ago we put them in jail to find out what they know and it worked he mentioned Judy Miller by name he replied by saying it may involve putting reporters in jail they spend a couple days in jail make a new friend and they are ready to talk so another point in the authenticity of these memos but also to the you know ambivalence to a lot of people people feel about James Comey he said he laughed at those comments like they keep seems to not be bothered by them so remember James Comey was a Republican he was the number two under John Ashcroft he's writing these memos at the time so again he has no fight with Donald Trump Donald Trump says let's put some reporters in jail and Kobe's like that's an interesting idea all right so it was a ridiculous statement and it goes back to this this this idea that Trump just likes us to say things to divert attention from anything else and especially I think he might be worried and he clearly he does not like reporters he's officially does not like reporters who say anything bad about him which tends to be most reporters yes so in dark jails would be like you know so the sting at the seams right so and it's not even just saying bad things about him just reporting the facts which is the opposite of his lies so that's that's what he but that's not why you sent reporters a jail I mean if there was any issue at all he would be having to do with leaks and of classified intelligence but that's again Trump doesn't understand any of that he's just like I don't like them they keep telling things that are true that I just obviously know what I say can we put them in prison he's asking the FBI director whether you could put journalist in jail so this part of the memo isn't really getting as much attention as I feel like it should there's a lot more you know attention paid to the hookers and I understand why but this is the part that actually worries me the most because Trump has pretty successfully done damage to credible news organizations even if we don't like those news organizations even if we don't think they do a great job in covering real news stories that we think are important CNN is not fake news right CNN could do a better job on some stories but it doesn't spread lies or fabricate stories and Trump has successfully convinced his base that they're the bad guys they are to be attacked they're not to be trusted and then you know behind the scenes he's talking about imprisoning journalists that don't give up the sources which by the way legally can happen that did happen to Judy Miller for when she was working for the New York Times but that sets a really scary environment for people who want to be whistleblowers I mean we already lived in a scary environment for whistleblowers but anyone who wants to do real journalism so there needs to be something done to ensure our protection because I think people are way too quick to forget about the First Amendment the protections the journalist out right we have we have a freedom of the press we have a freedom of expression and and and he does not like that and so his his idea is to sort of move that out of sort of a democratic situation into into how he sees how things should be and and that that is a concern it's a concern to all journalists and that was around the time where he was lambasted a regular basis right and then having these side conversations with call me bringing up all the stuff that he was concerned about and and journalists were part of that yeah yeah and then finally guys if we normalized this and we let him stay around for eight years he those instincts are real those are documented in private meetings with an FBI director he's not even it's not for the his base it's not part of his strategy it's not at a pep rally it's privately talking to the FBI director hey can we put journalists I don't like in jail you let that guy stare around long enough you know what he's gonna do put journalists in jail that's what he's gonna do you just watch the video by the young turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
