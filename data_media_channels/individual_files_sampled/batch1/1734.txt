publicly Donald Trump is often dismissed the investigation into potential collusion between his campaign and Russian operatives but there are now reports he ordered the man behind it fired last June but apparently White House attorney Dan McGann threatened to quit in protest so the president backed down Trump had his usual response to the news but here's what we do know trump has seemed fixated with the Russia investigation it started a March 2nd of last year when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation Trump was furious saying sessions was supposed to protect him on March 20th FBI director James Comey admits the agency is investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia May 9th he was fired and the very next day Trump told visiting Russian diplomats that firing him took the pressure off the Russian investigation he said something similar on camera and in fact when I decided to just do it I said to myself I said you know this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story that backfired on May 17th Special Counsel Robert Muller was appointed to lead the investigation and on June 8th Comey testified to Congress the Trump had asked him for loyalty and to drop the investigation into Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn that raised the possibility that Trump broke the law by attempting to obstruct justice former federal prosecutor Melanie Sloan says if in that same month he attempted to also fire Muller that could also be considered against the law of course he'll loop it into the obstruction of justice case he will examine the question of what were the details of when Trump was thinking of firing him what had exactly happened was it right on top of other events so it would be part of that pattern of misconduct that Bob Muller is looking at president Trump could get a chance to clarify all this to Muller himself the president says he expects to sit down for an interview with investigators in the coming weeks but it comes with his own risks lying to them would be a federal offense all on its own patty Colleen al-jazeera Washington
