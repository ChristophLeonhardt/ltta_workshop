is unprecedented this is the first time the US government has ever released a secret Foreign Intelligence wiretap application heavily redacted as you can see but this four hundred pages of documents does shed some light on how the feds came to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter page Chris Hayes has been reporting on this story from the very start you interviewed Carter page about the ins and outs and is here live to tell us what we are learning here is the context the new material debunked some of Donald Trump's attacks in this space showing the FBI first applied for a wiretap on page in October 2016 based on a suspicion he was an agent of a foreign power the Kremlin conducting basically quote targeted recruitment on him to undermine and influence the 2016 election so Wow the FBI appearing to play the collusion card saying it believes Russia had quote coordinated with Paige and possibly others associated with the Trump campaign and the courts have approved of this wiretap of Paige so there isn't any public evidence that has shown any problem with the fact he was surveilled that does not prove that he was a foreign agent or that he has done anything criminal but it does indicate several judges found there was good reason to investigate him if you're keeping score that means the new material does help some critics of the Trump campaign more than it helps Paige who once told Chris Hayes he thought this moment today would somehow help him I think when the truth comes out when when speaker Paul Ryan says the FISA warrant they were the funny the details about the dodgy dossier and what happened and all its documents around that it's going to be released that's what I'm really excited about I think that the truth will set a lot of people free here is some of the truths yeah redacted truth tell us you know there's a few key things here one is it that you got to take a step back for a second write the entire chronology of the story about the origin of this and its centrality to the quote witch-hunt make no chronological sense the investigation starts in summer in July this applications happens in October so it just has never ever scanned that the origin story of what happened was the quote dossier was Carter page was Pfizer surveillance ever ever ever the dates don't line up right so that becomes clear here second of all there's the other thing that strikes me is think about the secrecy of this document and the explosiveness of it had any part of it made its way to the public in October of 2016 that part that you just read we've been terrible we worry about Russians coordinating with Carter page to subvert the election right that was secret it was kept secret it should have been kept secret the whole thing was run in secret Carter page has never been as you said he's never been formally accused of a crime he's never been indicted but again it's another indicator of the of the degree of alarm there was in a real time while that campaign was happening while we were getting news about what the Russians were doing that there was an active effort of collusion that was being actively investigated by the FBI and never ever ever a peep was made in public or leaked any of it to the public well something you've reported on for a long time is the weaponization and misuse of information laundered into conspiracy theory we keep having these moments where rules are changed or broken precedents broken to get something out and then when it finally comes out they say it's the opposite of what you tie to the opposite or they don't want to talk about it take a look at Sarah Huckabee Sanders for your analysis on this now that it's all out today is he concerned or does he not believe the intelligence community's assessment that Carter page was again I think that we've spoken extensively what our position is on this and we're had no changes to that not exactly a victory lap no I mean this has been your thing there's been a pattern here where they attempt to attack and subvert the investigation into the possibility of collusion with a foreign adversary by pointing to some secret thing you can't see it's like a neat narrative trick over there inside that box is a thing that shows it's all a deep state conspiracy and then eventually the Box gets opened up and it shows just the opposite and they maintain that it is justified what they did it Devin Nunez has done this time and time again her Page who I think believes this is a Malik's culprit Tory believes that he's the subject of a vast conspiracy we're sort of doing the same thing tonight did he text you that today no but he is very celebratory about this document on what it shows as is devin noone isn't as the president even though what it shows is an incredibly rigorous process put into view to deal with what was at the time in real time an inordinately serious set of allegations they were invested well and doesn't it show concrete evidence from multiple sources of a suspicion that he was either knowingly or unknowingly being abused by a foreign power and that's bad and it's that latter part that's key here right I mean a much of what is said in that that application that we could read is about him being essentially recruited somewhat without his own knowledge into being an agent of a foreign power as they are trying to subvert this law this election there seems to be a lot of that right there are attempts at a lot of recruitment there's attempts a lot of reaching out there's a lot of doors that are getting knocked down throughout that campaign again now that we know about which we didn't know about at the time there's also the other aspect of this which is you know when people say play Freebird like we always go back to the classics but you're here you've had some revelatory exchanges let's play the free bird which is chris hayes exchange with carter page you told one reporter I had no meetings of the Russians and now you're telling me I had no means with the Russians about the things they were talking about I'm just trying to get a straight answer like did you meet Sergei kiss luck in Cleveland did you talk to him I'm not going to deny that I talked with them I don't say I will say that I never met him anywhere outside of Cleveland let's let's just say that my the only time that you met him was in Cleveland III what that I may have met him this was this has been a Carter sort of lined throughout right a kind of grudging and glancing admission that there were contacts with Russians and all sorts of contacts there are always like there's just nothing there just nothing Oh as I met him for five minutes or I met this person or met it maybe I met this deputy of a Russian oil company or I'm gonna read you the last line there because you know you and I both like to see what witnesses say quote I may have met him possibly I might have met him right and this is and this is what happens time and time again and I'm part of what I think is is key to understand it but this vise application is he's having these brush ups and these interactions with various people the intelligence community already is running surveillance on a lot of them on the other side right reason there's an application on Carter is because he's an American citizen you can't surveil an American citizen without going to the FISA Court but a Russian agent you can surveil so they're looking at the other side of the context they're looking at the what people are reporting back right in the interior of Russian intelligence about their contacts with this individual that is causing them in part to want to surveil him in the first place well and that again goes to might be some asymmetric information here which is started the key I think understanding this whole thing right so the feds are all over it so you know to quote Shawn Carter feds still lurking somewhere in America Miley Cyrus still twerking and the feds have been lurking around all this hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world
