I'm wondering how his death has changed you well as put pressure kind of up my game so a vacuum is being left in the Senate when they write the history of the Senate John will be in the first paragraph Ted Kennedy John McCain kind of modern people who were ideological opponents but could find ways to move things forward on our side he was to keep her the flame for the Reagan view we make history we are not run over by it America's values our strongest asset not our military count me in you got Marco you got some you got a new generation sort of McCain II acts coming up and so the the natural person to kind of keep that way of thinking alive is me because we're so close so on my side I'm trying to fight back against isolationism nativism you know if you leave them alone they'll leave you alone that won't work Senator Lindsey Graham says he is best positioned to carry the mantle of John McCain his increasingly vocal support of Trump policies is perhaps calling that into just a tad bit of question yeah I'm Mike Barnicle it's that's essentially Lindsey says that because since John McCain's death most observers have said that lindsay has kowtow to Donald Trump and just about every way possible even saying it's a shame that John didn't have more time to get to know Donald Trump he might have liked him no that's actually there's more salt ER and others who knew John McCain best will tell you that actually would have just made John McCain hate Donald Trump so Eve anymore you know it was interesting watching that clip Joe Jeffrey Goldberg our friend one of the nicest smartest people you'll ever come across very polite dignified sat there listening to Lindsey talking about John McCain and McCain iax and McCain's role in life and toward the end of that answer Jeffrey is just staring at the floor as if to say you know I can't believe what I'm hearing from him I don't know what happened I don't think anybody really knows what happened to Lindsey Graham John McCain has now been gone for several weeks and Lindsey has done a complete 180 in terms of what he how he views mr. Trump and and things that mr. Trump does it's it's I think it's mystifying to a lot of people it's certainly mystifying to me well I'll tell you what if Lindsey Graham decided instead of sucking up to Donald Trump if he decided to carry the mantle of John McCain forward he said along with Marco Rubio and others well that would be great that would be great not only for Lindsey Graham it would be great for the people of South Carolina who you represents be great for this country and it'd be great for the world they'd be great for those alliances mica that people like John McCain and your father spent their entire lifetime trying to preserve and trying to make the United States a beacon against totalitarianism and authoritarianism across the globe right now at least over the last month Lindsey Graham hasn't been acting that way let's hope based on what he said at the Atlantic conference with Jeffrey let's hope he makes the decision to move in in in the direction that John McCain moved his entire life thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
