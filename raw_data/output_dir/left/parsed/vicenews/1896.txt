hey my name is bj 11 I'm the executive
producer of the Vice on HBO series this
sunday we're dropping a vice special
report called fixing the system in a
historic visit we follow President
Barack Obama as the first standing
president to ever enter a federal prison
to talk to inmates personally about
civil rights behind bars we think it's
somehow normal for a black youth or
latino youth to be going through the
system in this way it's not normal the
way we deal with crime in this country
is a critical issue and all of us your
advice are committed to keeping this
conversation going so watch the special
report and join me and other producers
on the show for a group skype chat
discussing the problems of America's
prisons
