1
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:06,416
TRUNK DOSSIER.

2
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:10,920
>> WE HAVE ONE OTHER LITTLE

3
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:13,623
PIECE HERE IN THE FBI AND WE

4
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:14,290
KNOW THAT ANDREW McCABE IS

5
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:15,658
UNDER INVESTIGATION.

6
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:17,193
NOW HE IS ALSO BEING

7
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:18,761
INVESTIGATED FOR LEAKS AS IT

8
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:20,964
RELATES TO GENERAL FLYNN.

9
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:25,001
AND THOSE LEAKS, WE KNEW FROM

10
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:29,672
THE GET-GO, WERE ILLEGAL,

11
00:00:29,673 --> 00:00:34,777
BECAUSE -- IT SHOULDN'T HAVE

12
00:00:34,778 --> 00:00:37,280
BEEN LEAKED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

13
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:40,483
>> THE INFORMATION WAS RELEASED

14
00:00:40,484 --> 00:00:41,851
IN THE VAULT AND IT REVEALED

15
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:43,219
THAT THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,221
OF COMMENTS ALLEGEDLY MADE BY

17
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:46,623
THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR ANDREW

18
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:47,457
McCABE ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP

19
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,224
AND FLYNN.

20
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:49,893
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE THAN

21
00:00:49,894 --> 00:00:51,527
THAT, WE KNOW THAT THEY LIST

22
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:53,630
McCABE AS A WITNESS IN THE

23
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:54,330
INVESTIGATION, NOT A SUBJECT.

24
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:56,399
BUT IT'S A FIRST TIME WE HEARD

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,800
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS AND THAT'S

26
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:01,170
AN IMPORTANT THING.

27
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:04,374
THE SENATE CHIEF PLED GUILTY TO

28
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,408
LYING ABOUT HIS CONTACTS WITH

29
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:06,709
THE MEDIA'S OF THE FACET WAS

30
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,311
GOING ON AND STARTING TO BE

31
00:01:08,312 --> 00:01:10,813
EXPOSED LITTLE BY LITTLE.

32
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:21,624
>> WE HAVE THE ENTIRE PUZZLE

33
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:22,358
FRAMED IN AND ARE FILLING IN THE

34
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,059
PIECES, IT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE

35
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,493
WHAT HAPPENED.

36
00:01:23,494 --> 00:01:24,227
CARTER, YOU ARE IN THE CENTER OF

37
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:24,527
THIS.

38
00:01:24,528 --> 00:01:25,628
WE KNOW THAT FOR PFIZER JUDGES,

39
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:27,597
AND WE KNOW THAT CHRISTOPHER

40
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:29,232
STEELE WAS ON STANDBY.

41
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:31,034
NOW YOU HAVEN'T ROD ROSENSTEIN

42
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:32,001
AND HE'S REFUSING TO TESTIFY

43
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:33,036
UNDER OATH.

44
00:01:33,037 --> 00:01:34,337
WE CAN'T GET GLENN SIMPSON TO

45
00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:36,506
TESTIFY UNDER OATH, WAY AND WE

46
00:01:36,507 --> 00:01:39,409
CAN'T GET THE THREE OH TWOS AND

47
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,910
FINDS OUT APPLICATIONS THAT WERE

48
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:42,045
ALL SUBPOENAED AND SUPPOSED TO

49
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:43,012
BE COMING OUT.

50
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:45,982
YOU ARE ASSUMING THE DNC, AND

51
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:46,349
WHO ELSE?

52
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,151
>> PERKINS COOLEY AND A FEW OF

53
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:49,686
THEIR PARTNERS.

54
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:52,822
>> WELL, I HAVE TO IMAGINE, YOU

55
00:01:52,823 --> 00:01:55,425
ARE GOING TO BE A REALLY WEALTHY

56
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:55,692
GUY.

57
00:01:55,693 --> 00:02:00,196
BECAUSE WHAT THEY DID TO YOU,

58
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:00,830
ALL YOUR FOURTH AMENDMENT

59
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:05,201
PROTECTIONS WERE STOMPED ON.

60
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:09,205
THIS ISN'T POLITICAL.

61
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:12,308
>> IT GOES BEYOND ANY DAMAGES OR

62
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:16,379
ANY FINANCIAL ASPECTS.

63
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,614
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY LIES AS

64
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:19,382
YOU ARE ALLUDING TO AND YOU LOOK

65
00:02:19,383 --> 00:02:21,718
AT THE DAMAGE IT DID TO OUR

66
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,253
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND

67
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:27,890
INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT BACK

68
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:28,224
IN 2016.

69
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:29,025
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET SOME

70
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:31,027
JUSTICE IN TERMS OF GETTING SOME

71
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:31,427
DISCLOSURE.

72
00:02:31,428 --> 00:02:35,198
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE PRIOR

73
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,335
DODGY DOSSIER CASES, LIKE

74
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:42,472
MR. GOODBAR AS, HE HAD

75
00:02:42,473 --> 00:02:43,172
INFORMATION OUT THERE IN THE

76
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:44,307
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

77
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:47,043
AND HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

78
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:49,045
HAVE BEEN FACING A LOT OF THINGS

79
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:50,213
ON IN TERMS OF THEIR

80
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:50,646
INVESTIGATION.

81
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:51,881
>> Sean: YOU ALSO HELP YOUR

82
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:53,649
GOVERNMENT, YOU WOULD DEBRIEF

83
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,884
AFTER TRAVELING ABROAD FREELY

84
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:57,653
WITH THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY,

85
00:02:57,654 --> 00:02:58,821
FBI, CIA.

86
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:00,289
AND THEY HAVEN'T INDICTED YOU.

87
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,424
REALLY QUICK AND THE LAST THREE

88
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,692
SECONDS WE HAVE COME UP WHAT'S

89
00:03:02,693 --> 00:03:05,328
NEXT HERE AND WHERE ARE THESE

90
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:07,263
THE CLASSIFICATIONS, AND WHERE

91
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:09,232
ARE THE UNREDACTED MATERIALS,

92
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:12,001
WHEN ARE THEY COMING?

93
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:13,703
>> I THINK THEY ARE BEING SWELL

94
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:16,005
LOCKED AGAIN AND I THINK IT'S

95
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:17,240
FRUSTRATING FOR THOSE WHO WOULD

96
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:17,874
BENEFIT FROM THE TRUTH.

97
00:03:17,875 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE
