FEELING TODAY. I WAS TALKING TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WITH STEVE SCALISE ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT IT WAS, AND THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. OUR PRAYERS ARE ANSWERED, LOOK AT HIM. A YEAR LATER TO THE DAY HE'S OUT THERE PLAYING SECOND BASE. NO WORDS, AMAZING. IT WAS AMAZING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, MARTHA, IT WASN'T JUST THE BRAVE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE BUT HIS TEAMMATES ONE YEAR AGO TODAY, SO MANY OF THEM JUMPED IN. DOCTORS WHO ARE ALSO REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THEY GOT UP AND PUT A TOURNIQUET ON HIM AND OTHER PEOPLE AND I SAVED THEIR LIVES. AND THAT IS WHY THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT TRYING TO RAISE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR AREA CHARITIES. TONIGHT, THEY SAW A GREAT SHOW.
