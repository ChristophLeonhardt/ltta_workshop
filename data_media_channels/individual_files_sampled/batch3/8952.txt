PART. WHAT DID RUSSIA DO? Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD TO SEE YOU, CONGRESSMAN. YES, MA’AM. Martha: ALSO WITH US TONIGHT FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO WHO HAS BEEN LISTENING TO THIS. YOUR THOUGHTS, JUDGE ON WHAT THE CONGRESSMAN AND I WERE TALKING IN TERMS OF THIS SPY ISSUE WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT IT. FULL DISCLOSURE, CONGRESSMAN GOWDY AND I ARE BUDDIES AND WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS BEFORE I LISTENED TO HIM TONIGHT. HE IS REALLY THE PERFECT PERSON TO TALK TO ABOUT THIS BECAUSE HE HAS SEEN A LOT OF THINGS THAT THE REST OF US HAVE NOT SEEN. BUT THE ALLEGATIONS BY MAYOR GIULIANI OVER THE WEEKEND WHICH WOULD LEAD TO US BELIEVE THAT THE TRUMP PEOPLE THINK THAT THE FBI HAD AN UNDERCOVER AGENT WHO HIS WAY INTO THE CAMPAIGN AND WAS THERE AS A SPY ON THE CAMPAIGN SEEM TO BE BASELESS. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR THAT WHATSOEVER. BUT THE OTHER ALLEGATION ABOUT THIS PROFESSOR WHOSE NAME WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO MENTION, TALKING TO PEOPLE ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT IS STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE IN INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AND IN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS. Martha: ALL RIGHT. BUT, OBVIOUSLY, THE PRESIDENT IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THAT PERSON. HE FEELS LIKE THERE WAS SOMEONE SPYING ON THE CAMPAIGN AND IT JUST GOES BACK TO THE OTHER QUESTION ABOUT IF THAT WERE THE CASE, AND THE PRESIDENT SAID I WANT TO KNOW IF ANYBODY IS WORKING WITH RUSSIA, WHY WAS HE NOT SORT OF CLUED IN TO THAT AND HE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN A TWEET OVER THIS WEEKEND, TOO. SHOULD HE HAVE BEEN? IN MY OPINION, YES. BUT, QUITE FRANKLY, THAT’S A JUDGMENT CALL. SOMETIMES YOU DON’T WANT TO TELL PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEIR ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN INVADED, SO TO SPEAK. BECAUSE YOU DON’T WANT THAT WORD TO GET OUT THERE. Martha: JUDGE, THEY ARE CLAIMING THAT INVASION WAS SO DEEP IT IMPACTED THE OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATION. THAT’S WHAT JIM CLAPPER SAYS. YES. Martha: THAT’S A CRIME IN PROGRESS. HOW YOU CANNOT STEP IN SAY YOU, YOU AND YOU ARE OFF THE CAMPAIGN. WE WANT TO KNOW WHO YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO. IS IT NOT STOPPING A CRIME IN PROGRESS? I UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT’S FRUSTRATION THAT HE WAS NOT INFORMED OF THE FACT THAT HIS CAMPAIGN WAS BEING INVESTIGATED. NOT BECAUSE THEY THINK THE CAMPAIGN DID ANYTHING WRONG BUT SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE UNWITTINGLY OR PERHAPS WITTINGLY WELCOMED THE RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE CAMPAIGN THAT DONALD TRUMP DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT IT WHAT I HAVE TOLD THE CANDIDATE I WOULD HAVE. BUT I RESPECT THE JUDGMENT OF THOSE WHO DECIDED NOT TO TELL HIM. NOW, LOOK, IF THEY WERE THERE FOR SOME NEFARIOUS REASON, THE ONE GIULIANI SUGGESTED, TO GATHER DATA FROM THE CAMPAIGN AND PASS IT TO THE WEST WING AND PASS IT TO MRS. CLINTON, I WOULD WANT TO SEE EVIDENCE OF THAT BEFORE I MADE AN ALLEGATION
