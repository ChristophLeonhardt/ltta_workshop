like in any footvolley match an all-time favorite Brazilian sport Claudio Lagos is the endgame in the country's presidential elections surrounded by in certainty as always a question mark with politics in Brazil but I think that more than ever we need to change the country's future the latest opinion poll puts the former Army captain and congressman Jade Ball Senado ahead with 28% of the vote that's why he's convalescing after being stabbed and nearly killed he says election fraud is his main concern now although he offered no proof that the elections next month will be rigged the big concern isn't losing the vote it's the possibility of fraud there's a real chance of it happening in the runoff and maybe even in the first round opinion poll suggests he'll likely face Fernando Haddad who trails behind with 19% of the vote a long way short of the 40% share held by his mentor former president Lula da Silva before he was banned from running from his jail cell Lula highly praised our campaign and said that it is to strengthen this that we want to build a country of peace and harmony focusing on work and education but so Nader has made headlines with his misogynist homophobic and sexist comments at his winning support with his strong stand against corruption he puts himself as someone as an outsider so although he is a politician for many years so he was trying and I think successfully to conquer this idea that politics is politics is contacted by corruption and so he has a very strong speech against corruption and he captures that feeling both as an outsider and as someone that is going to solve the problems of the corruption problems in a very simple manner although many say this is the most unpredictable election since personal to democracy many people here say that one thing they can agree on is that they're fed up with corrupt politicians they'd like to think a new government will help clean up that image for many the lack of trust in their politicians now runs too deep to think anything will change Mariana Sanchez al Jazeera Rio de Janeiro Brazil
