new poll out from creepy AK about Donald Trump it's got some really bad news for them it's got a little bit of good news for which I find to be super frustrating we'll get to that in a second and then it ends with disaster so it's a fun roller coaster ride let's go on that ride so first easy-peasy first question is to your approval amor don't you and the answer is a resounding new we do not fifty five to forty America's disapprove of Donald Trump from time to time Donald Trump brags about this because it's like oh yeah I'm doing great my approval numbers are up and they did go up to one poll at one time had them at forty five percent that's really bad you're supposed to be above fifty percent and if you're below fifty percent you it's underwater and that means your presidencies head in the wrong direction but for Trump it was never headed in the right direction but he had gotten into some of the polls into the low 40s and he started too high step which is hilarious right but now he's back down to forty and he's gonna keep on going down he's been lower and he will be lower but understand the context because everything's the regular rules of politics and the world have been suspended since Donald Trump is president and that the president doesn't have to be popular and that it won't hurt his party and it won't hurt him if he's going out for a real action yes it will math still exists he was just running against an incredibly unpopular candidate last time these are disastrous numbers all right but it gets way worse so is he honest no fifty eight to thirty eight percent say he is not honest that's gigantic difference and obviously true that number should be way higher by the way yeah I mean that thirty eight percent have you ever heard Donald Trump but still good number overall for people who are rational fifty five to forty three say he does not have good leadership skills every one of these numbers should be near hundred-percent but yes overall good most people get it he's not a good manager he's an idiot well no I shouldn't say that hold-hold for that number but they don't think he's a good manager okay fifty five to forty three say that he does not care about the average American tell you man for any president these are terrible numbers 62 234 don't believe him when he say he's a very stable genius they say he is not level-headed 62 234 no so not a good sign for the President of the United States and the commander-in-chief if by almost a 30 point margin the country thinks you are not level-headed or stable let alone a genius but again hold for that depressing fact I don't want people think of his intelligence okay 60 to 37 percent say he does not share their values disaster on top of disaster one last one of the disastrous sort before we get to the worst of the worst and the best of the best 62 236 say he does not provide the us with moral leadership to which I say of course of course he doesn't what part of Donald Trump is moral are you kidding me and even as those supporters now a lot of them that 36% is pretty much movable like Oh Donald Trump super moral on what planet but it doesn't matter cos overwhelming majority of countries say no he does not provide moral leadership that's preposterous even some of his own supporters go I support him but he does not provide moral leadership okay now here's the too depressing ones 63 to 32% say that he is a strong person Oh Democrats you are the worst now why do you think Donald Trump keeps talking about how great he is you know I have the best words in fact there of course legendarily you know I'm like a smart person I'm like a smart person he just put out a tweet saying I'm a very stable genius there's two things that I'm really good at in life what is being mentally stable who says that only a lunatic says that if someone said that to you at a bar you would run for your life hey how you doing you don't want to top two qualities I have is that I'm very mentally stable no one would stay at the bar right he's the president anyway and his second great quality he claimed was that he was really smart now why does a person act out like that because they're deeply insecure he never makes fun of himself he's never self-effacing he's afraid that people might find out it's true he does nothing but insane bragging because he's deeply insecure you know why because he's not actually strong and the minute anyone strong shows up he cowers like every bully there is but the Democrats are so pathetically weak that they think the American people haven't been 31% advantage on strong person and by the way don't get me wrong I get why he does bully people and he does come out and you know is super aggressive so I'm not shocked by that number of course I get I just can't stand the Democrats that they couldn't bring that number down let me add a Maus okay now the one that's the really depressing 57 to 39 say that he is in fact intelligent okay forget the Democratic Party they're they're the worst already there is that was establishment people Hillary Clinton I said they don't know how to fight him right but I despair the American people the you listener guy who says I'm like a smart person and you think oh yeah yeah because smart people go around all the time saying I'm like a smart person he said that two different times and then he tweeted it he wrote out I'm like a smart person to be fair so did Einstein no he didn't I never said that because it was actually smart how do you look at Donald Trump and think he's smart and so the the sickness that unfortunately has befallen this country is that if you're rich or pretending to be rich people will say well he must be strong he must be smart I mean he's rich he must be smart he inherited two hundred million dollars from his dad if you inherited two hundred million dollars from your dad you would also have a lot of money and what's frustrating is that people be like oh yeah Bob he's really smart man you see the way that his dad died and gave him the money he banked Trump bankrupted himself six times which I'm pretty sure you wouldn't do if your dad gave you two hundred million dollars but by a margin of nearly 20 points 18 points Americans think that he is intelligent oh that is so so sad now I told you there'd be bad news for him good news forum we were through all that now the truly disastrous news for procore de this poll Quinnipiac poll very respected organization President Trump is racist forty nine percent of voters say while forty seven percent say that he is not racist that's an unbelievable number now if you're out there and you don't like Trump and you know all the things that he's done Central Park five diverse we conspiracy the constant dehumanization of Latinos Muslims etc you think that number should be higher but look guys you not everybody lives in in your bubble or in your context or in your particular group right for a majority of Americans or at least a strong plurality of Americans for forty nine percent of Americans to say that the President of the United States is racist for most Americans that's a very very heavy word and and I think that we use it appropriately on Trump and on others who actually discriminate his people of different races that's kind of definition but the average American is very reluctant to use that word so for 49% to say yes the president is racist that's amazing and disastrous for Trump I mean how do you vote for a guy if you think he's racist if you think he's such a bad guy that he hates other people of other races so this whole idea that Oh Trump is above the laws of physics and math is simply not anywhere near true this guy is deeply deeply unpopular and and one last thing that's important for the country is that voters say by a margin of 55 to 39 that Trump has emboldened people who hold racist beliefs to express those beliefs publicly that's a 14 point margin for Americans saying not only is the president racist but whether I think he is won or not he's definitely emboldening racist so look some folks might look at that and slugga yeah I know but if you're rich my paycheck went up if you're not mad didn't but maybe one day it will or yeah he's racist but so my it's and a lot of those people will vote but I can't imagine that it's such a huge percentage of those people that'll work Oh vote for him so he starts out in a hole if he's around in 2020 that is very hard to climb out of if half the country thinks you're a racist it's pretty hard to get elected but on the other hand probably a good number of those folks thought that even before the election and the Democratic establishment found a way to lose to him anyway I wonder how they pull on intelligent
