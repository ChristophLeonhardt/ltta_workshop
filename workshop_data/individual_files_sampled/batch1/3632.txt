hi I'm Brian Wong co-founder and CEO of keep so I want to be very clear there's a huge difference between messing around on a beach and literally doing nothing on being a lazy potato versus actually taking time and jotting down notes in your would you write or me when I type or and just thinking about ideas of what happened over the last few days and the last couple days have been amazing like I was spent you know time with my team out in LA and we had all these ideas I've written a lot of them down but the only time I'll have to process and really understand what happened it's gonna be over that period of time on Saturday so I I usually encourage folks to take sort of these mini sort of vacations or many sort of wipeout days where you just don't touch any digital media and you focus on just letting your thoughts sort of marinate and that's incredibly important one of the things I talk about is a splurge day there's a lot of science behind this so you do in a string of ways all the things you like to do in one day so for example and no particular order I love ice cream I love jacuzzis I love wine I love skiing I mean all these things if I can combine all four of those things in one day that's obviously amazing and I can do that during the winter by the way the point is there's a lot of things you can do again and cram it in a day that what it does is it makes your brain fire all the good stuff all your happy sort of whatever chemical it is in your head starts to kind of marinate and help you just become a lot more motivated and have something again to look forward to periodically so I think it's important people have mind space because if you continue to suffocate yourself if you don't give yourself that space you will burn up and it the signs are very very very easy to tell it's someone who just doesn't have that additional oomph or spark and you're just numbing your way through life rather than being excited about everything
