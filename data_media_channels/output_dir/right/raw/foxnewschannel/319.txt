1
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:10,744
>>> AVENATTI IS A BEAST.

2
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:12,746
HE KEEPS POPPING TRUMP AND HIS

3
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:13,446
FOLKS IN THE MOUTH.

4
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,215
HE MAY BE THE SAVIOR OF THE

5
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:15,649
REPUBLIC.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,617
>> HE IS A MASTER OF THE MEDIA

7
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:18,018
CYCLE.

8
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,786
>> I OWE AVENATTI AN APOLOGY.

9
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,321
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS

10
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:24,224
I'M SAYING ENOUGH ALREADY,

11
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:24,591
MICHAEL.

12
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:25,859
I SEE YOU EVERY.

13
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,127
WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?

14
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:27,827
I WAS WRONG.

15
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:28,795
YOU HAVE A LOT TO SAY.

16
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:29,996
THE DEMOCRATS COULD LEARN

17
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:31,264
SOMETHING FROM YOU.

18
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,699
>> Tucker: SAVIOR OF THE ME

19
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,105
RUB -- SAVIOR OF THE RELUB --

20
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:40,140
REPUBLIC.

21
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,142
WHO GIVES THESE PEOPLE SHOWS.

22
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:46,446
HUNDREDS OF MEDIA APPEARANCES

23
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:49,249
PROPELLED HIM TO BE LEADING

24
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,051
CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY.

25
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,953
BUT THE CREEPY PORN LAWYER

26
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:54,754
REMINDED THE PUBLIC WHILE

27
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:55,922
EVIDENCE AND THE PRESUMPTION

28
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:56,957
OF INNOCENCE MATTER.

29
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,491
IT MAY HAVE SAVED BRETT

30
00:00:58,492 --> 00:00:59,926
KAVANAUGH IN THE PROCESS.

31
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,128
SO NOW THE FORMER BENEFACTORS

32
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,531
ARE MAD AND THEY ARE TURNING

33
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:05,298
ON HIM.

34
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,466

DEMOCRATS' CASE AGAINST

37
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:11,204
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WAS WEAKENED

38
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:15,909
BY MICHAEL AVENATTI.

39
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,977
>> AVENATTI IS THE BEST THING

40
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:18,078
TO HAPPEN TO KAVANAUGH.

41
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,379
ALL THE DEMOCRATS FLIRTING

42
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,814
WITH HIM HAVE TO BE

43
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:21,314
EMBARRASSED.

44
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:22,382
>> A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE

45
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:23,817
SAYING AND ARE YOU HEARING

46
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:24,150
THIS?

47
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,685
THAT HE TOOK A SYMPATHETIC

48
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:26,820
CASE WITH FORD AND TURNED IT

49
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,521
INTO A CIRCUS LOSING THEM THE

50
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:29,789
HIGH GROUND.

51
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,223
>> YES.

52
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,224
THE MICHAEL AVENATTI CIRCUS

53
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,292
COMES TO TOWN.

54
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,094
>> AVENATTI CAME IN WITH THE

55
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,229
SWETNICK ALLEGATION OF THE

56
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,130
DRUGGIE GANG RAPE STUFF THAT

57
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,032
SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS

58
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,568
TAKEN AS CREDIBLE.

59
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:42,335
>> AVENATTI DUD A HUGE FAVOR

60
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:47,641
TO THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE.

61
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:48,775
>> Tucker: DAVID IS AN

62
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,077
ATTORNEY AND FORMER ADVISER TO

63
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,379
SENATOR PATTY MURRAY.

64
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,246
HE JOINS US.

65
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:54,514
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

66
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:55,548
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

67
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,783
>> Tucker: DID IT TURN OUT

68
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,686
THAT STORMY DANIELS' FORMER

69
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,054
LAWYER NOT IN THE END THE

70
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:04,524
SAVIOR OF THE REPUBLIC AS

71
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:05,759
MSNBC DUBBED HIM?

72
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,494
>> IT GIVES HIM TOO MUCH

73
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:09,062
CREDIT TO SAY HE WAS THE

74
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,265
DECIDING FACTOR IN THIS.

75
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,234
WE KNOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WAS

76
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,168
CONFIRMED BECAUSE OF A PROCESS

77
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,236
THAT THE REPUBLICANS RAN AND

78
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:17,737
THEY WERE SINGLE-MIND AND

79
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,239
DETERMINED TO ENSURE THE

80
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,340
NOMINATION NO MATTER THE

81
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,241
SERIOUS AND CREDIBLE

82
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,777
ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE RAISED

83
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:24,277
AGAINST HIM.

84
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:24,911
>> Tucker: I THINK YOU ARE

85
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:25,345
RIGHT.

86
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,280
I'M NOT SURE HE WAS DECISIVE

87
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:27,947
IN THIS.

88
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,549
THEY WEREN'T THE ONLY

89
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,216
SINGLE-MINDED DETERMINED

90
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:30,583
PARTY.

91
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,787
THE DEMOCRATS WERE THOSE

92
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:35,989
THINGS TOO.

93
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,057
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE

94
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:38,825
ALLEGATION OF HIS CLIENT THAT

95
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,594
SHE ATTENDED TEN CONSECUTIVE

96
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:42,796
GANG RAPES, DIDN'T REPORT IT

97
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:43,663
TO THE POLICE OR TELL FRIENDS

98
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,732
OR RELATIVES AND JUDGE

99
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,167
KAVANAUGH WAS PRESENT AT SOME

100
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,768
OF THESE DRUGGING THE PUNCH.

101
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,371
BUT WAIT, SHE SAYS LATER HE

102
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:51,705
WASN'T.

103
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,039
IS THAT A CREDIBLE ALLEGATION,

104
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,341
DO YOU THINK?

105
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,942
>> WHAT STRIKES ME ABOUT THE

106
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,477
ALLEGATION AND I BELIEVE SHE

107
00:02:57,478 --> 00:03:00,847
SWORE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY

108
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:07,053
IN HER DECLARATION.

109
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,888
AS A LAWYER THAT SAYS

110
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:09,789
SOMETHING TO ME.

111
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,990
>> Tucker: SHE CONTRADICTED

112
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,759
IT IN A LATER INTERVIEW.

113
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,994
>> MY TAKE-AWAY, OCTOBER 2

114
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:15,929
THAT SHE WANTED THAT

115
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,230
ALLEGATION TO BE INCLUDED THE

116
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:17,964
SCOPE OF THE F.B.I.

117
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:18,398
INVESTIGATION.

118
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,999
TO ME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A

119
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,969
RIGHT WAY FORWARD ALLOWING FOR

120
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:29,642
THE F.B.I. TO FAIRLY AND

121
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,911
IMPARTIALLY CREDIT HER

122
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:32,379
ALLEGATION.

123
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,747
>> HOW WOULD THEY DO THAT

124
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:35,081
SINCE E GAVE HER DECLARATION

125
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:35,582
UNDER OATH.

126
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,752
SHE NAMED NO OTHER PERSON

127
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:41,321
PRESENT OTHER THAN PEOPLE WHO

128
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,957
ALREADY UNDER OAT DENIED --

129
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,358
UNDER OATH DENIED SHE WAS

130
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,259
TELLING THE TRUTH.

131
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,360
THERE WAS NOBODY LEFT TO

132
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,529
INTERVIEW BUT HER AND SHE WAS

133
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,033
MAKING CLAIMS SO STUPID EVEN

134
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:54,734
SENATORS DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.

135
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,537
THERE WERE NOT TEN GOING RAPES

136
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,472
IN A ROW AND NOBODY KNEW IT.

137
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,874
WHY DIDN'T THEY SAY C'MON,

138
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,344
THIS IS NOT HELPFUL.

139
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:07,147
>> I THINK YOU DID SEE MEMBERS

140
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:08,248
GIVE MORE CREDENCE TO

141
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,482
DR. CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD'S

142
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:09,849
TESTIMONY.

143
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,788
THE FOCUS ON FORD'S TESTIMONY

144
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:18,391
WAS POEERFUL BECAUSE SHE

145
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,325
FORWARD AND TESTIFIED AND THEY

146
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,260
COULD ASK HER QUESTIONS.

147
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,562
THE BROADER TAKE-AWAY FOR ME

148
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:23,930
IS UNFORTUNATELY THE F.B.I.

149
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,331
INVESTIGATION WAS NOT

150
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:25,765
COMPREHENSIVE.

151
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,333
IN FACT, JUSTICE KAVANAUGH AND

152
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,168
DR. CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD

153
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,235
WEREN'T EVEN INTERVIEWED AS

154
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,336
PART OF THE INVESTIGATION.

155
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,005
SO, I THINK IT WAS A MISSED

156
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:32,839
OPPORTUNITY FOR TO US CLEAR UP

157
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,843
A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS.

158
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:37,510
>> Tucker: I WANT TO

159
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,645
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE

160
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:39,012
SAYING.

161
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,815
ARE YOU SAYING BECAUSE CREEPY

162
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:42,882
PORN LAWYER'S CLIENT CLAIMED

163
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,384
TEN CONSECUTIVE GANG RAPES

164
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,785
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND YOU

165
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,487
KNOW IT AS WELL AS I, THAT SHE

166
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,422
WASN'T INTERVIEWED FROM THE

167
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,790
F.B.I. MEANS HE COULDN'T HAVE

168
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,658
BEEN CONFIRMED.

169
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,760
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE

170
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:54,994
MR. AVENATTI USING THAT TERM.

171
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,396
I DON'T WATCH YOUR SHOW.

172
00:04:56,397 --> 00:05:02,635
>> I'M NOT FULLY -- RIGHT.

173
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,105
THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTED

174
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:10,109
STORMY DANIELS, SAVIOR OF THE

175
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,710
REPUBLIC.

176
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:11,945
>> I'M NOT SURE HE IS A

177
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:14,514
LEADING CANDIDATE.

178
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,949
>> Tucker: HE HAS BEEN

179
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,250
INVITED BY DEMOCRATS IN EARLY

180
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,251
PRIMARY STATES.

181
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,053
ARE YOU SAYING THAT BECAUSE

182
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,088
HIS CLIENT, THE TEN GANG RAPE

183
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,757
IN A ROW CLIENT, SHE WASN'T

184
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,125
INTERVIEWED ABOUT HER LIED

185
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,062
CROSS CLAIMS THAT SOMEHOW

186
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,430
KAVANAUGH SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

187
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:30,897
CONFIRMED?

188
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,098
>> THAT IS NOT WHAT I SAID.

189
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,501
I WISH SHE HAD BEEN INTERVIEW

190
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,804
AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE

191
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:38,671
LOOKED AT THE STORY AND

192
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,639
OFFERED A COMPLETE RECORD.

193
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,541
I'M SAYING I THINK WE HAVE A

194
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,308
MISSED OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE

195
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,743
THERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS

196
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,111
OUTSTANDING BECAUSE THE F.B.I.

197
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,546
INVESTIGATION WAS NOT ALLOWED

198
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,948
TO BE AS COMPLETE AND HOLISTIC

199
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,750
AS I THINK MANY MEMBERS,

200
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,752
CERTAINLY THE DEMOCRATIC

201
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,354
MEMBERS, YOU SAW THE STATEMENT

202
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,922
WISH THEY HAD BEEN.

203
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:56,856
>> Tucker: QUICKLY BOTTOM

204
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:57,490
LINE IT.

205
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:01,060
JUST ABOUT THE CREEPY PORN

206
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,362
LAWYER, C.P.L. COMPONENT.

207
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,097
ARE YOU HAPPY TO HAVE HIM IN

208
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,398
THE PARTY AND KEEP DOING WHAT

209
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:05,999
HE IS DOING?

210
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,400
THAT IS WHAT THE DEMOCRATS

211
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,102
STAND FOR OR GO BACK TO DOING

212
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:14,974
WHATEVER HE DOES.

213
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,210
>> WE ARE A BIG TENT PARTY SO

214
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,611
I AM HAPPY FOR ANYONE STEPPING

215
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,846
UP FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN

216
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,882
BUT IT WILL BE A BIG CROWD

217
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,217
FIELD SO I'M NOT GOING TO

218
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,351
OFFER A FORECAST WHO IS THE

219
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:25,818
NOMINEE.

220
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,320
>> Tucker: I AM ROOTING FOR

221
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:27,854
