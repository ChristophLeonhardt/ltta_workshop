1
00:00:00,493 --> 00:00:02,494
HILLARY CLINTON, TONE IT DOWN,

2
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:02,961
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

3
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,096
>> Laura: THANK YOU SO MUCH,

4
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:06,932
GLAD TO HAVE YOU BOTH BACK.

5
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:08,900
IN THE TYPE OF NONVIOLENCE WE'VE

6
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:10,535
BEEN SEEING FROM THE LEFT, IT'S

7
00:00:10,536 --> 00:00:13,471
NOTHING NEW.

8
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:14,906
THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA WAS

9
00:00:14,907 --> 00:00:16,074
LOOKING IN THE 1960s AND HE

10
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:18,009
HAD HIS OWN WAY OF DEALING WITH

11
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:18,910
THE PROBLEM.

12
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:21,746
JOINING US NOW WITH,

13
00:00:21,747 --> 00:00:23,315
PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN CRAIG

14
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:23,648
SHIRLEY.

15
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,717
I'VE BEEN DYING TO TALK TO YOU,

16
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:26,718
AS THE TEMPERATURE IS RISING.

17
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,119
YOU GET THE SENSE ESPECIALLY

18
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,021
THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, THAT'S A

19
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:32,357
BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOW AND

20
00:00:32,357 --> 00:00:34,626
IN 1969, PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO CALL

21
00:00:34,627 --> 00:00:40,899
LISTS, CAN COALESCE IN A PLACE

22
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,299
REALLY

23
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:41,700
FAST.

24
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:43,068
HOW DID REAGAN DEAL WITH IT AND

25
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:46,104
HOW MIGHT WE LEARN FROM THAT?

26
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:48,974
>> HE DEALT WITH IT WITH A LOT

27
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:50,175
OF WIT AND GRACE.

28
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:54,112
DURING THE VIETNAM WAR HE WAS

29
00:00:54,113 --> 00:00:55,513
CONFRONTED BY A SMELLY,

30
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,148
MALODOROUS, DIRTY AND DISHEVELED

31
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:57,682
HIPPIE.

32
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,085
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BILL CLINTON,

33
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:01,653
BUT THAT HIPPIE WAS CARRYING A

34
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:04,856
SIGN THAT SAID, MAKE LOVE, NOT

35
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:05,323
ROAR, WAR.

36
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:07,192
HE TURNED TO HIS AID AND SAID HE

37
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:08,693
COME FROM THE LOOKS OF HIM, I

38
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:14,132
DON'T THINK HE WOULD DO EITHER.

39
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:14,666
>> Laura: [LAUGHS]

40
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:16,301
>> IN BERKELEY AGAIN THERE WAS A

41
00:01:16,302 --> 00:01:18,169
GROUP OF UNRULY STUDENTS OUT

42
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,307
THERE, ANTIWAR PROTESTERS.

43
00:01:22,308 --> 00:01:23,842
THEY WERE MAKING A SCENE AND

44
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:26,277
MAKING THEMSELVES OF OBNOXIOUS.

45
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:27,212
REAGAN WROTE ON A PIECE OF PAPER

46
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:31,049
AND PUT IT UP TO A SHEET OF

47
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,451
PAPER AND SAID, I'M SELLING MY

48
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:33,752
BONDS.

49
00:01:33,753 --> 00:01:34,919
HE HAD A WAY OF DEALING WITH

50
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,591
THESE THINGS BY TURNING HUMOR TO

51
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:41,926
HIS ADVANTAGE, WHICH CAN BE A

52
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:42,827
GREAT ASSET IN AMERICAN

53
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:43,194
POLITICS.

54
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:44,529
>> Laura: IF YOU'VE SEEN TRUMP

55
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,931
IN RECENT DAYS OF THESE RALLIES,

56
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:47,732
HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN EXTREMELY

57
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,033
FUNNY.

58
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:52,570
AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S A

59
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,506
DIFFERENT AND ENVIRONMENT

60
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:54,906
MEDIAWISE.

61
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,475
THE MEDIA WAS AGAINST DRAGON,

62
00:01:57,476 --> 00:01:58,243
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT

63
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:02,313
ABOUT THE WAY THE CLIPS ON

64
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:03,114
SOCIAL MEDIA ARE SHARED.

65
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:05,750
THIS IS FROM 1969, AND THIS IS

66
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,452
IN A PUBLIC MEETING WITH THE

67
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:10,288
BERKELEY ADMINISTRATION DURING

68
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,556
ALL OF THE CHAOS ON CAMPUS.

69
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:14,292
LET'S WATCH.

70
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:15,894
>> ALL OF IT BEGAN THE FIRST

71
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:17,362
TIME SOME OF YOU WHO KNOW BETTER

72
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:18,063
AND ARE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW

73
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:20,899
BETTER BUT THEN PEOPLE, YOUNG

74
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,333
PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY HAD THE

75
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:23,701
RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE LAWS THEY

76
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:24,903
WOULD OBEY AS LONG AS THEY WERE

77
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:27,105
DOING IT IN THE NAME OF SOCIAL

78
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,706
PROTEST.

79
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:31,209
>> IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR

80
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,709
TODAY'S TIME?

81
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,244
YOU CAN TRASH SOMETHING AND PULL

82
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:34,079
DOWN A STATUE BECAUSE YOU DON'T

83
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,612
LIKE IT.

84
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:38,149
GET THE MIDDLE FINGER TO THE

85
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,684
PRESIDENT BECAUSE SOMEONE GAVE

86
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:41,319
YOU THE LINES TO SAY?

87
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,254
>> HE BROKE IT DOWN TO HIS

88
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:47,092
ELEMENTS, TO HIS COMPONENTS.

89
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:49,294
IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT SOCIAL

90
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:49,961
JUSTICE BUT ABOUT CREATING

91
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:50,895
INJUSTICE.

92
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:51,763
THIS IS THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE

93
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:53,298
BETWEEN THE TEA PARTY OF SOME

94
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,500
YEARS AGO AND THE PROTESTERS OF

95
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:56,935
TODAY.

96
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:58,336
THE TEA PARTY WAS DEFENDING

97
00:02:58,337 --> 00:02:59,871
INSTITUTIONS AND THE PROTESTERS

98
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:01,506
OF TODAY ARE TRYING TO TEAR DOWN

99
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:02,474
INSTITUTIONS AND THAT'S THE

100
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,709
ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

101
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,976
TWO.

102
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,411
>> Laura: I THINK YOU HAVE

103
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:07,512
HEARD FROM SOME OF THE

104
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:09,280
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE GOTTEN IN

105
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,316
THE FACES OF THE SENATORS, AND

106
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:12,650
THEY SAY THEY WANT TO TAKE IT

107
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,853
ALL DOWN.

108
00:03:14,854 --> 00:03:16,688
THERE WAS A PIECE IN THE POST

109
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:17,789
TODAY BY ONE OF THEM.

110
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,057
THEY WANT TO TAKE IT ALL DOWN,

111
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:21,326
NOT ABOUT WINNING A PARTICULAR

112
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:25,897
POINT OR AN COURT SEAT, IT'S

113
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:26,498
ABOUT TAKING THE ENTIRE

114
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:31,803
FRAMEWORK WHICH IS JUST PUSHING

115
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:32,971
AGAINST MINORITY GROUPS IN THEIR

116
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:33,505
VIEW.

117
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:36,074
>> WE ARE FACING THE 21ST

118
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:37,008
VERSION OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION

119
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,776
WHICH AS YOU RECALL WAS ABOUT

120
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:40,411
TEARING DOWN ALL INSTITUTIONS IN

121
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:41,713
FRANCE AND DESTROYING

122
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:42,914
EVERYTHING.

123
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:46,117
MARRIAGE, CONTRACTS, MONEY,

124
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:46,684
GOVERNMENT, PROPERTY,

125
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,452
EVERYTHING, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE

126
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:49,354
AT THE TIME WHAT THEY CALLED

127
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,555
SOCIAL JUSTICE.

128
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:53,892
AND THAT IS WHAT THE MODERN LEFT

129
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:54,926
ANTI-PROTESTERS ARE ABOUT, IT'S

130
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:56,494
ABOUT DESTROYING ALL FABRIC OF

131
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:58,396
SOCIETY IN ORDER TO START OVER

132
00:03:58,397 --> 00:00:00,000
AND EVERYBODY SUPPOSEDLY STARTS
