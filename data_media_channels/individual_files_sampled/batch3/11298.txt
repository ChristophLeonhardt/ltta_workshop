go to a breaking news story from this morning in Syria where Israel is to blame for the downing of a Russian military plane off the coast of Latakia that's according to the Russian Defense Ministry it claims the Israeli Air Force used the Isle 20 plane as cover from Syrian air defenses missiles from which hit the aircraft 15 crew members died as a result four Israeli fighter jets had been targeting Syrian facilities in Latakia province at the time she did on the 17th of September at around 10 p.m. for Israeli fighter jets launched guided bombs on Syrian military facilities near the city of Latakia the bombing occurred in the immediate vicinity of where the Russian il 20 was coming in to land the Israeli Jets deliberately created a dangerous situation the Israeli pilots used the Russian plane as cover against the Syrian air defense systems as a result the Russian il xx was brought down by a Syrian air defense missile there's no way the Israeli pilots could not have seen the Russian plane military confirms it's Jets had targeted Syrian facilities but blamed the planes downing on the Syrian government itself along with Iran and Hezbollah which Israel views as a terrorist group we asked him asked us to comment on the Israeli allegations and we'll bring you any response we do get our Middle East correspondent Paula Slayer has more well we're hearing from Israeli officials that any time soon the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin we're also hearing from a senior Israeli official that Israel is maintaining ongoing contact with the Russian government and the Russian military officials at all levels and providing details from the Israeli army side they have conducted an initial inquiry and they have released their statements to put the blame of this downing of the Russian plane firmly on the shoulders of Syria they say to quote that there was extensive inaccurate and indiscriminate Syrian anti-aircraft fire that was used they also point out that when the Russian plane was downed it was not in the vicinity where the israeli air force planes had to the operation and that it also happened when Israeli planes were already back in Israeli airspace now the Israeli Defense Forces has issued a statement in which it expressed regret regret had said it mourned the the killing of fifteen Russian servicemen and while it acknowledged that it had in fact carried out these bombings in Syria as I say it did not put the blame on its shoulders take a listen Israel expresses sorrow for the death of the aircrew members of the Russian plane that was down tonight due to Syrian anti-aircraft fire Israel holds the Assad regime whose military shut down the Russian plane fully responsible for this incident now in that same statement the Israeli army went on to say that it had notified its Russian counterparts using existing communication mechanisms of its Air Force operations now this does seem to contradict what came out of a phone conversation earlier between the Russian Defense Minister Sergei shoigu and his Israeli counterpart Avigdor Lieberman in that conversation the Russian Defense Minister said that there was less than a minute before the Russian plane was hit that the Israelis informed the Russian side of the operation he also said that there was no way that the pilots could not have seen the Russian plane that was landing from a altitude of some five kilometers now 15 servicemen were killed it happened at around 10 o'clock last night Monday night local time the Russian plane was on its way back to the Hammerman Air Force Base near the Syrian city of Latakia it was some 35 kilometers off the Syrian coast when it lost radar signal the Israelis used four f-16 fighter jets to strike a number of targets inside Syria one of which was a power station and reports are that some seven people on the ground were injured from those strikes at the same time there was a French frigate that was firing from the Mediterranean Sea on the ground right now in Syria there is a search and rescue operation underway so on a diplomatic level we're waiting to hear more from the Israeli side and looking towards this phone conversation that will happen between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Putin other downed Russian plane was an IL 20 it's a Patrol military aircraft known by NATO as coot top speed of nearly 700 kilometers an hour quite a big wingspan as well it's renowned for its durability the L 20 has been in service since Soviet times according to the manufacturer this one was due to remain there until around 2020 now Russia's Defense Minister has said that Israel used the Russian jet as cover for airstrikes as it expected Syria wouldn't respond I've led me Putin agreed with Sergei shoigu findings adding that the downing of the plane was the consequence of a tragic chain of events well we're now joined we should be ensuring live any minute by political writer and commentator Marwa Osman well that's that's going to happen a bit later when we do get her on line now we heard that press conference earlier from mr. Putin and the prime minister of Hungary Auburn where mr. Putin said there would be a response from Russia as well which would guarantee the safety and security of Russian personnel and infrastructure in Syria that response would be visible straight away that's according to mr. Putin now last night's incident wasn't the only Israeli action in Syria against the military targets I discussed previous cases earlier with artis natira Tudor and the reason why Russia are pointing the finger at the Israelis is because of those past hostile actions saying that Israeli forces often took aim at Syrian targets so if we go back rewind to the 10th of February 2018 that's where an israeli f-16 fighter jet crashed after being hit by syrian defenses during an offensive in syria the two pilots parachuted to safety before the crash in northern Israel and it's believed that that was the first time that Israel lost one of its jets during these are in conflict the plane was hit during air strikes which happened in response to an Iranian drone going into Israeli territory that drone was shot down and then Israel later launch further strikes what we do have here is the explanation from the Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu as to the motivation behind that attack I've been warning for some time about the dangers of Iran's military entrenchment in Syria Iran seeks to use a Syrian territory to attack Israel for its professed goal of destroying Israel this morning Iran brazenly violated Israel's sovereignty they dispatched an Iranian drone from Syrian territory into Israel and this demonstrates that our warnings were 100% correct Israel holds Iran and its Syrian host responsible for today's aggression we will continue to do whatever is necessary to protect our sovereignty and our security now following that incident a phone call did take place between President Putin and Prime Minister Netanyahu and they agreed that military coordination with regards to Syria must continue they also agreed that they needed to avoid any steps that would lead to new confrontation in the region that was according to Interfax news now I'll explain a couple more incidents on the 9th of April Russia and Syria accused Israel of carrying out strikes against t4 airbase which is near Palmyra in central Syria the Russian Defense Ministry they said that Israel an Israeli aircraft launched a tow missiles five of those were intercepted by Syrian air defense systems and just one month on if we go forward there was a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Netanyahu on the 8th of May in 2018 and and unless me who came out after that meeting and said but Russia was unlikely to limit actions in Syria Israeli actions in Syria two days after that meeting another incident happened and we can't forget the Syrian reaction considering that these airstrikes are taking place without a UN Landin this aggressive conduct by the Zionist entity will lead to nothing but an increase in tensions in the region what we do know is that the Syrian government invited Russia to help during the Syrian civil war back in 2015 and Russia has almost turned a blind eye to these Israeli strikes have been taking place they've been feeling that they been acting as diplomats in a very complex region mediating between the various players Israel being one of them so if we look at the bigger picture and at this latest incident which took part took place at 10 p.m. local time on the 17th of September the Russian Ministry of desert defense is saying that the Israeli jet hid behind the Russian plane which led to it being set on fire that's a bold accusation from Russia and maybe it's because of these continuous airstrikes that would have been going on despite the fact that Israel and Russia have been allies they have been claiming to be Friends of Russia and and that's a contradiction in itself from the Russian perspective it's almost like a betrayal for them so there's no doubt the tensions between the two nations have grown a sultan mahmud Holly a former member of the Pakistan Air Force gave us his reaction to the incident but what as a former aircrew has a former flyer I can analyze and give you my personal opinion I could be wrong but I believe that you see in this particular case there is a possibility that Russia is a right that this bigger radar shadow of the Isle 20 was used as a cover by the for attacking Israeli f-16 fighter aircraft because please remember that in February for the first time and Israeli f-16 was shot down by a similar missile and this time there is a chance that they may not be willing to take the risk of you know facing the fire coming from the Syrian side and they may have taken cover of the bigger aircraft now you see I've flown in that area and I know very well that there are there are radar and contacts available the Israelis must be monitoring it and there are Israeli controllers who speak the Russian language they could have forewarned this particular aircraft but the warning which came only a minute short of it was far too late that means that the die had been cast and these 16 aircrew and the ill-fated il 20 had already been sacrificed to save those four f-16s I mean this is my personal opinion who has given permission to the Israelis to come and bomb them over there the United Nations is there Mossad is supposed to be one of the top most intelligence agencies in the world why can't it share its information with Russia or more importantly with the United Nations which can take action over there if they are going to take clandestine action and they also claim that they have done it 200 times earlier then I think such an accident was waiting to happen and I'm sorry for the time being prima facie it seems Israel is to be blamed Russia's foreign ministry summoned the Israeli ambassador over Monday night's events reports are coming in that the Israeli prime minister plans to hold a phone conversation with Vladimir Putin very shortly today we have discussed with the director of nasus think-tank a Marwick off how exactly relations between Russia and Israel are likely to play out after this well what we expect as a first response is to limit Israeli capability inside Syria and probably Lebanese airspace the Israelis are not going to be given free hand anymore we think it would be the natural response because there will be there have they must have been a lot of pressure on Russia from Syrian leadership from the Syrian thereon and saying look these people are our reigning free we can't stop them you don't upgrade our systems our systems are too old and you don't participate in this now Russia has been a victim of these shenanigans itself so it can make you know a step forward in this and can draw a line and say okay no more Israeli intervention otherwise we will take action and we will we've always warned against Russian servicemen being targeted and now it happened we're not gonna allow this anymore so this is the first response that we expect you
