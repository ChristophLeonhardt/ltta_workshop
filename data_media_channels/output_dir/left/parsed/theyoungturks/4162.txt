THOSE WHO ATTENDED THE RALLY IN
CHARLOTTESVILLE VIRGINIA
ARE NOW FACING THE CONFERENCES
OF BEING IDENTIFIED AS
NEO-NAZIS, OR WHITE
NATIONALISTS.
ONE OF THOSE IS ACTUALLY FORMER
EMPLOYEE OF TOP DOG, WHICH
IS A HOTDOG CHAIN.
NOW, HE WORKED AT THIS HOTDOG
CHAIN IN BERKELEY, AND
APPARENTLY THE TWITTER ACCOUNT
@YESYOURERACIST
IDENTIFIED HIM, BUT UP HIS
PHOTO, AND THEN HIS
EMPLOYER WAS NOTIFIED THAT HE
TOOK PART IN THIS HATE RALLY.
AS A RESULT, HE WAS FIRED.
HIS NAME IS COLE WHITE; NO
LONGER WORKS FOR THE COMPANY.
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE A LOT
OF THESE GUYS ARE SUPER YOUNG.
COLLEGE AGED, EARLY 20S,
LATE TEENS, AND LOOK, YOU PUT
YOURSELF OUT THERE IN THIS
WAY, YOU ARE IN A PUBLIC
PLACE, YOU HAVE NO REASONABLE
EXPEDITION OF PRIVACY, THERE ARE
CONFERENCES FOR YOUR BEHAVIOR.
YEAH, AND SO, YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND
NOBODY IS STOPPING YOU FROM
GOING TO THE RALLY.
YOU WENT TO THE RALLY, YOU WERE
PROUD OF IT.
AND YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO
HIDE YOUR IDENTITY.
I'VE BEEN TO RALLIES, POLITICAL
RALLIES, PEOPLE TAKE PICTURES
OF ME, THAT MAKES SENSE, I'M AT
THAT RALLY, I'M IN PUBLIC.
NOW, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
CONTACTING THEIR EMPLOYER;
I WOULDN'T DO IT, THAT'S NOT THE
DIRECTION I WOULD GO, BUT
IF THE EMPLOYER FINDS OUT AND
DOESN'T WANT THAT PERSON IN
THEIR ESTABLISHMENT BECAUSE THEY
THINK IT WILL DRIVE DOWN
BUSINESS, I BELIEVE THAT'S
CALLED A FREE MARKET.
AND ALSO, EVERYONE, REGARDLESS
OF WHAT YOU GET INVOLVED IN
PUBLICLY, RISKS LOSING THEIR JOB
IF THEY ARE IDENTIFIED.
AND SO, IF I WAS AT THIS
RALLY, AND SOMEWHAT PHOTO AND
POSTED IT ALL OVER THE INTERNET,
AND YOU FIRED ME, CAN I CRY
ABOUT YOU FIRING ME?
THAT'S THEIR EXPERTISE, SO THEY
WILL CRY AND CRY AND CRY.
THEY ARE LIKE, WHAT?
I JUST WANTED TO HATE BLACK
PEOPLE, AND GAYS, AND JEWS IN
PEACE.
YOU ARE MISSING IT, WE ARE GOING
TO ALLOW YOU TO DO IT, IT'S
A FREE COUNTRY.
YEAH, THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWS YOU
TO DO IT.
BUT PRETTY SURE THAT TOP DOG
ISN'T PART OF THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT.
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF
SPEECH.
YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE
POPULAR; YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO A PARTICULAR JOB; YOU HAVE A
RIGHT TO FORCE A PRIVATE
COMPANY TO DO YOUR BIDDING.
YOU ALSO DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT
AGAINST CRITICISM.
PEOPLE CAN CRITICIZE YOU, THAT
IS NOT YOUR FREEDOM OF
SPEECH BEING TAKEN AWAY.
THAT IS PRIVATE CITIZENS
EXERCISING THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT
RIGHT BY CRITICIZING YOUR
SPEECH.
