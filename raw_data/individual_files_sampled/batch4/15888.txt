I'll jail and Jim calm campaign was started when we heard the Anjem Choudary a convicted terrorist extremist Islamist and a man whose radicalized people who then went on to murder and even behead people on British soil was being released after serving only half of his prison sentence and well it happened and Jim Chowdhury has today been released from prison and the story is even more concerning than we thought because during Anjan Choudhary's time in prison it turns out that he refused to take part in any of the d radicalization courses and exercises counter extremism sources told the BBC that on many occasions Chowdhury was given the opportunity to talk to mainstream religious leaders and experts who've previously had success with extremists but on every occasion Anjem Choudary of course refused i suppose that comes as no surprise this is a man with some real conviction he hates the West and he's not gonna give in anytime soon Chowdhury infact spent most of his time in Her Majesty's Prison Frankland in County Durham in a separation unit which was specifically designed for high-risk terrorism offenders who might radicalize others so if he was kept in isolation in prison in a specially designed unit because they were scared that he might radicalize others how is it that he's just being released to the public after two and a half years by the way at the cost of two million quid a year from my taxes and your taxes while why are we just letting this guy roam the streets radicalize whoever he likes but they're so concerned that in prison he was kept in an isolation unit because you know the authorities tell us that he'll have multiple restrictions upon leaving and they have to work with probation officers and for six months he'll be kept in a North London hostel a bail hostel which by the way is probably nicer than most flats that people can afford in central London these days but he will have some restrictions which are as follows banned from preaching or attending certain mosques he can only associate with people pre-approved by the authorities it can only use one phone that doesn't have internet access but the internet access he does have will be supervised and he can't leave the UK without permission but here's the most ridic and insulting part of these restrictions he won't be able to leave London now here's the thing London our capital city where he's done most of his preaching or a lot of his preaching and radicalizing is home to radical mosques and extremists is where his own followers have gone out and committed terrorist atrocities will be his home that he can't leave if anything I don't want Anjem Choudary in London I don't want him to be barred from leaving this is absolute insanity this man is dangerous and we know he is even Tereza may knows he is because no doubt that's why she sounded so terrified during a press conference yesterday which was meant to be about the EU when someone asked her about an Jim chowder in her voice started breaking she sounded terrified and rightly so and she didn't really give us much of an answer either but John Woodcock a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee rightly tweeted that the release of chowder II was wrong crazy and puts the public in danger exactly it's true and we know that this is the view of the majority of the British public as well it's not just the experts it's the majority of normal Brits because thanks to your support we commissioned a professional public opinion poll on the issue we commissioned one poll a reputable opinion polling company that works with Sky and ITV and they asked 2,000 people about Anjem Choudary and 68% of those who responded said that they think Chowdhury should be put back behind bars and serve his full prison sentence at least but 12% amazingly also said that he should be released but we already know that there's a vocal minority in the UK of far left and Islamist extremists who are happy to see men like Chowdhury go unpunished so the British people want him locked up high-ranking officials recognize that he's a threat Teresa may sounds terrified of a man and rightly so but the government's doing nothing about it nothing that's why we must do something and I've already delivered a petition that more than 11,000 of you signed and handed it straight into Downing Street in fact I went straight up to down these streets number 10 door knocked on the door and gave it straight into the government and the Prime Minister will have seen that along with our poll results but I want to keep on pressuring her think this is the end of our campaign because now that Anjem Choudary has been released I think we've got to step up our game on this I would still like to see if we can raise enough funds to get a billboard in central London it's not the easiest thing to do but I'm sure we can do it and I'd like to get it as close to Parliament as possible a massive jo-anne gym billboard that simply says jail and gym that the politicians will see every single day and I wonder if you could help me do that please join our campaign at jo-ann gym comm share the website and petition far and wide to all your friends and family and consider chipping in whatever you can afford if we can get this huge billboard up in London then it really kicks this jail and gym campaign off and really tells the politicians exactly what we think if we can raise the funds I'll get that billboard up in London and we'll call on the government to jail Anjem as well as always extremists mates who have been released as well we must keep our streets safe and we must keep pressuring our government so thank you for your support so far let's keep going I want the government to hear us they have to act so we must act we must tell them to act will you help me with this please head over to jail and Jim calm and let's get this monster locked back up you
