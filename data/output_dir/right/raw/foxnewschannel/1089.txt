00:00:00,654 --> 00:00:02,822
AND EVEN MORE GOOD NEWS ON THE

2
00:00:02,822 --> 00:00:03,290
ECONOMY TONIGHT.

00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,492
WE WILL HAVE ALL OF THIS AND

4
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:05,859
MORE.

5
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:09,829
BUCKLE UP, AN AMAZING NIGHT AND

6
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:10,830
OPENING NEWS MONOLOGUE.

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,400
THIS IS GREAT NEWS, THE DATE HAS

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,235
BEEN SET IN THE

9
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:16,136
INSPECTOR GENERAL MICHAEL

10
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:17,938
HOROWITZ ANTICIPATES THE RELEASE

11
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:19,639
OF HIS ALL-IMPORTANT REPORT,

12
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:20,907
THIS HAS GONE ON 18 MONTHS AND

13
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:23,410
THE DATA SET FOR NEXT THURSDAY,

14
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,878
ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT.

15
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:26,079
FOR WEEKS WE HAVE BEEN

16
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,048
PREDICTING THAT THESE FINDINGS

17
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:29,349
WHAT EFFECT BE BURIED AND

18
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:32,252
RELEASED WHEN ALL EYES WOULD BE

19
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:33,453
FIXED ON THE PRESIDENT'S

20
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:35,522
HISTORIC MEETINGS IN SINGAPORE.

21
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:36,923
SADLY, I THINK MY PREDICTION WAS

22
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:38,758
SOMEWHAT RIGHT AND IT'S ONLY TWO

23
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:40,493
DAYS AFTER THIS BIG SUMMIT TAKES

24
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:41,061
PLACE.

25
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:44,297
AND THEN OF COURSE THIS WILL BE

26
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:44,698
RELEASED.

27
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:46,733
WHAT HAS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

28
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:47,500
POTENTIALLY REDACTED OR CHANGED?

29
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,069
THEY'VE HAD IT FOR OVER TWO

30
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:51,705
WEEKS NOW, DID THEY ALTER ANY

31
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:52,105
LANGUAGE?

32
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:53,206
HOW WILL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,

33
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:55,208
WILL THEY GET THE TRUTH IN ALL

34
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,142
OF THIS?

35
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:57,544
WILL THEY BE PREVENTED FROM

36
00:00:57,544 --> 00:00:58,745
SEEING THE TRUTH?

37
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:01,748
IN OTHER WORDS, ARE WE GOING TO

38
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:05,218
GET UNFETTERED CONTENTS OF

39
00:01:05,218 --> 00:01:06,219
INSPECTOR GENERAL HOROWITZ'S

40
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:06,953
REPORT?

41
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:09,422
NEXT WEEK ON HANNITY WE WILL BE

42
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:10,423
ANALYZING THAT REPORT PAGE BY

43
00:01:10,423 --> 00:01:12,225
PAGE ON WHAT WILL BE ONE OF THE

44
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:15,362
MOST CONSEQUENTIAL DAYS IN

45
00:01:15,362 --> 00:01:27,540
MODERN HISTORY.

46
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:31,745
MODERN HISTORY.

47
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:32,479
THAT IS TWO DAYS OF COURSE AFTER

48
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:32,879
THE SUMMIT.

49
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,513
SORRY, I AM SUSPICIOUS AND

50
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:34,214
HOPEFULLY I WILL BE    STAND COR

HOPEFULLY I WILL BE    STAND COD

NEXT WEEK.

55
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:35,615
ONE GOOD DEVELOPMENT TO REPORT,

56
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:36,316
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HOROWITZ

57
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:36,983
IS SET TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE

58
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:37,717

ALL OF THIS ON THE HEELS OF A

61
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:39,886
NONSTOP EFFORT THAT WE HAVE SEEN

62
00:01:39,886 --> 00:01:40,620

00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,288
OF JUSTICE TO CONGRESS TO

64
00:01:41,288 --> 00:01:41,588
OBSTRUCT CONGRESS

65
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:44,224

AND THAT HIS OVERSIGHT IN THEIR

67
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,661
INVESTIGATIONS.

68
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:48,862
ACCORDING TO SENATOR GRASSLEY'S

69
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:51,264
OFFICE, THE DOJ IS NOW REFUSING

70
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:52,365
TO MAKE DOCUMENTS AND AT LEAST

71
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:55,468

00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:58,305
OVERSIGHT INTO THE FBI'S ONGOING

73
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:00,340
GENERAL FLYNN INVESTIGATION.

74
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,941
ADD TO THIS THE DOJ CONSTANT

75
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:03,143
SLOW WALKING OF THOSE DOCUMENTS

76
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:04,944
TO ALL THE HOUSE COMMITTEE IS,

77
00:02:04,944 --> 00:02:06,746
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE

78
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:08,782
COMMITTEE, THE OVERSIGHT

00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:09,149
COMMITTEE.

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:09,848
SARAH CARTER WILL TAKE DOWN I

81
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:11,484
CAN TELL YOU ALL ABOUT A HUGE

82
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:13,787
FIGHT EARLIER TODAY AND HOW THE

83
00:02:13,787 --> 00:02:15,021
DOJ HAS RENEGED EARLIER THIS

84
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:17,657
MORNING ON A PREVIOUS COMMITMENT

85
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:19,526
TO SUPPLY DOCUMENTS THAT ARE

86
00:02:19,526 --> 00:02:21,061
RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATION.

87
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,930
THE BIG BATTLE, IT ENDED UP THAT

88
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,631
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NOW

89
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:30,370
ADDED UNPRECEDENTED NEW RULES ON

90
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,938
HOW THEY PLAN TO BRIEF MEMBERS

91
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:32,339
OF CONGRESS.

92
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:34,407
WHAT WE NEED IS FOR YOU, THE

93
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:35,642
AMERICAN PEOPLE COME UP TO BE

94
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:38,445
ABLE TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF.

95
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:40,447
YESTERDAY WE REPORTED ON HOW ROB

96
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:41,815
ROSENSTEIN ARROGANTLY REBUFFED

97
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:42,716
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM IN HIS

98
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:45,418
LETTER DEMANDING TO KNOW WHY THE

99
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:49,422
HEAD OF THE MUELLER IN THE

100
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:50,590
INVESTIGATION HAS NOT RENOUNCED

101
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:50,924
HIMSELF.

102
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:52,392
INCLUDING HIS KEY ROLE IN    IN

103
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:52,425
INCLUDING HIS KEY ROLE IN    INH

104
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:52,659
INCLUDING HIS KEY ROLE IN    INE

105
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,227
DECISION TO FIRE JAMES COMEY

106
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:55,528
PERIODS WITNESS NUMBER ONE IN

107
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,030
THAT CASE AND OF COURSE, HE WAS

108
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,833
THE PERSON THAT SIGNED OFF ON

109
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,700
THE THIRD SUBSEQUENT RENEWAL

110
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,634
APPLICATION AS IT RELATES TO THE

111
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:04,337
PFIZER WARRANT THAT OF COURSE

112
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:07,073
WAS SPYING ON A TRUMP CAMPAIGN

113
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:07,440
ASSOCIATE.

114
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,244
SENATOR GRAHAM IS RESPONDING.

115
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:14,147
>> ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH

116
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:15,482
WHETHER ROB ROSENSTEIN HAD BEEN

117
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:15,815
RECUSED?

118
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:17,450
>> NO.

119
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,752
YOU TALK ABOUT A

120
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:19,285
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

121
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:20,687
INVESTIGATION AND I GET THAT.

122
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,622
THE QUESTION IS, THE OBSTRUCTION

123
00:03:22,622 --> 00:03:24,290
OF JUSTICE.

124
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,492
THEY NEED TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK

125
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:29,362
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS AN

126
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:30,463
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE BY FIRING

127
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:30,864
HIM.

128
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:33,066
HE'S A FINE GUY AND I HAVE

129
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:33,666
NOTHING AGAINST HIM.

130
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,070
I THINK HE IS DOING A GOOD JOB.

131
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,904
I UNDERSTAND WHY JEFF SESSIONS

132
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:38,872
CAN'T DO THIS.

133
00:03:38,872 --> 00:03:41,107
I'M REALLY CURIOUS AS TO HOW

134
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:42,742
ROSENSTEIN COULD BE INVOLVED IN

135
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:43,877
OVERSEEING THIS INVESTIGATION IF

136
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:45,512
HE'S GOING TO BE A WITNESS.

137
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:46,446
>> Sean: WE WILL HAVE MORE ON

138
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:49,482
THIS THROUGHOUT THE SHOW BUT,

139
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:52,252
FIRST WE HAVE AN AND EXTREMELY

140
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,853
IMPORTANT BIT OF NEWS.

141
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:54,754
THE PRESIDENT'S HISTORIC

142
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:56,322
IMPENDING TRIP TO SINGAPORE JUST

143
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:58,057
DAYS AWAY FROM HOLDING THESE

144
00:03:58,057 --> 00:04:00,126
TALKS WITH THE NORTH KOREAN

145
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:00,727
DICTATOR, KIM JONG UN.

146
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:04,063
THEY ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE

147
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:05,465
COMPLETE AND TOTAL

148
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:06,666
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN

149
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,033
PENINSULA.

150
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:09,269
ALL OF THAT IS ON THE LINE.

151
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:10,303
EARLIER TODAY, THE PRESIDENT

152
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:13,306
GAVE A PREVIEW OF THE UPCOMING

153
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:13,606
TRIP.

154
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:15,041
>> President Trump: I HOPE THE

155
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:15,742
UPCOMING MEETING IN SINGAPORE

156
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:17,944
REPRESENTS THE BEGINNING OF A

157
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:20,213
BRIGHT NEW FUTURE FOR

158
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:21,748
NORTH KOREA, AND INDEED, A

159
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:24,584
BRIGHT NEW FUTURE FOR THE WORLD.

160
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:25,752
THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

161
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:28,054
KOREAN PENINSULA WOULD USHER IN

162
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:30,924
A NEW ERA OF PROSPERITY,

163
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:33,193
SECURITY, AND PEACE FOR ALL

164
00:04:33,193 --> 00:04:35,929
KOREANS, NORTH AND SOUTH.

165
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:37,831
AND FOR PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.

166
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:39,065
WE COULD ABSOLUTELY SIGN AN

167
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:39,632
AGREEMENT.

168
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:41,234
WE ARE LOOKING AT IT AND TALKING

169
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:42,836
ABOUT IT WITH THEM, TALKING

170
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:44,704
ABOUT IT WITH A LOT OF OTHER

171
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:45,305
PEOPLE.

172
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:47,474
THAT COULD HAPPEN, BUT THAT'S

173
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:48,041
REALLY THE BEGINNING.

174
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,343
IT SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT STRANGE

175
00:04:50,343 --> 00:04:51,344
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY THE EASY

176
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:52,479
PART.

177
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,848
THE HARD PART REMAINS AFTER

178
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:55,448
THAT.

179
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:56,249
MAXIMUM PRESSURE IS ABSOLUTELY

180
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:56,683
INEFFECTIVE.

181
00:04:56,683 --> 00:04:59,452
WE DON'T USE THE TERM ANYMORE

182
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:01,187
BECAUSE WE ARE GOING INTO A

183
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:02,889
FRIENDLY NEGOTIATION.

184
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,491
PERHAPS AFTER THAT NEGOTIATION,

185
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:06,092
I WILL BE USING IT AGAIN.

186
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:08,461
HE WILL KNOW HOW WELL WE DO IN

187
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:09,362
THE NEGOTIATION, IF YOU HEAR ME

188
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:13,766
SAYING WE ARE GOING TO USE A

189
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:19,038
MAXIMUM PRESSURE, THEN YOU KNOW

190
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:19,772
THE NEGOTIATION DID NOT GO WELL.

191
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:20,507
>> IF THE SUMMER DUMB ACTS ON GO

192
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:23,042
WELL WILL YOU INVITE KIM JONG UN

193
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:24,043
TO THE UNITED STATES?

194
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:25,845
SPEAK TO THE ANSWER IS YES TO

195
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:26,846
THE SECOND PART OF YOUR

196
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:28,448
QUESTION, CERTAINLY IF IT GOES

197
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:28,748
WELL.

198
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:29,682
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE WELL

199
00:05:29,682 --> 00:05:30,950
RECEIVED AND I THINK HE WOULD

200
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,453
LOOK AT IT VERY FAVORABLY, SO I

201
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:34,454
THINK THAT COULD HAVE BEEN.

202
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:36,890
ALL I CAN SAY IS I'M TOTALLY

203
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:37,524
PREPARED TO WALK AWAY.

204
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:40,126
I DID IT ONCE BEFORE.

205
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:41,160
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WALK

206
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,694
AWAY.

207
00:05:41,694 --> 00:05:43,296
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

208
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:46,866
THE POTENTIAL TO DO SOMETHING

209
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:49,135
INCREDIBLE FOR THE WORLD.

210
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:52,138
IT'S MY HONOR TO BE INVOLVED.

211
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:52,772
>> Sean: THE SECRETARY OF

212
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:54,107
STATE MIKE POMPEO HAS PAID     P

213
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:54,140
STATE MIKE POMPEO HAS PAID     A

214
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,173
STATE MIKE POMPEO HAS PAID     E

215
00:05:54,173 --> 00:05:54,207
STATE MIKE POMPEO HAS PAID     D

216
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:54,741
STATE MIKE POMPEO HAS PAID     A

217
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:56,109
VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THESE

218
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:57,343
DISCUSSIONS THAT LEAD UP TO ALL

219
00:05:57,343 --> 00:05:59,412
THIS AND HE WEIGHED IN ON THESE

220
00:05:59,412 --> 00:05:59,913
UPCOMING TALKS.

221
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:01,381
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

222
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:02,782
>> THE FACT THAT OUR TWO LEADERS

223
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:05,084
ARE COMING TO THE TABLE SHOWS

224
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:06,352
THE TWO SIDES ARE VERY SERIOUS.

225
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:07,787
THE DIPLOMATIC MODEL WE USE

226
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:08,821
TODAY IS DIFFERENT FROM PAST

227
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:09,389
EFFORTS.

228
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:12,058
OUR EFFORTS GIVE US HOPE THAT WE

229
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:13,760
CAN FIND REAL SUCCESS WHERE PAST

230
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,864
EFFORTS HAVE FALLEN SHORT.

231
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:19,065
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS HOPEFUL.

232
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:20,767
BUT, HE'S ALSO GOING INTO THE

233
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,869
SUMMIT WITH HIS EYES WIDE OPEN.

234
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:24,270
WE HAVE SEEN HOW MANY INADEQUATE

235
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,872
AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN STUCK IN

236
00:06:25,872 --> 00:06:27,373
THE PAST.

237
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:29,309
YOU CAN BE SURE THAT

238
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:30,009
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NOT STAND

239
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:30,677
FOR A BAD DEAL.

240
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:33,146
>> Sean: HERE WE ARE ONLY DAYS

241
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:35,848
AWAY FROM DIPLOMATIC PROGRESS.

242
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:37,884
THE FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA

243
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:39,552
FRANKLY ONLY DREAMED OF AND THE

244
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:41,688
MAJORITY OF AMERICANS, ARE

245
00:06:41,688 --> 00:06:42,889
RESPONDING OVERWHELMINGLY NOW

246
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:43,856
SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT'S

247
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:44,490
UPCOMING SUMMIT.

248
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,893
ALL OF THIS AFTER THE MAINSTREAM

249
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,328
MEDIA DOUBTED.

250
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:49,762
THERE WAS FEARMONGERING, TALKS

251
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:51,898
OF NUCLEAR WAR, AND IN A SAD

252
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:54,067
WAY, I THINK MANY, BECAUSE I

253
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,368
DON'T LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

254
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:57,704
THEY WANT THE DEMOCRATS TO WIN,

255
00:06:57,704 --> 00:06:59,238
ACTUALLY ROOTING AGAINST THE

256
00:06:59,238 --> 00:06:59,939
PRESIDENT SUCCESS HERE.

257
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,908
THAT'S NOT FOR THE COUNTRY.

258
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:02,742
TAKE A LOOK.

259
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:05,979
>> THE IDEA OF A NUCLEAR

260
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:06,713
SHOWDOWN WITH NORTH KOREA KEEPS

261
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:09,983
YOU UP AT NIGHT, I'D RECOMMEND

262
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:11,084
DELETING YOUR TWITTER APP.

263
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:13,252
>> IS NOT BEING CAVALIER ABOUT

264
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:13,920
NUCLEAR WAR COMPANIES BEING

265
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,255
CAVALIER IN A WAY THAT MAKES HIM

266
00:07:16,255 --> 00:07:16,856
SEEM DEMENTED.

267
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:18,858
>> THESE ARE MESSAGES FROM A

268
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:21,461
LEADER WHO IS NOT FIT FOR

269
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:21,861
OFFICE.

270
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:23,663
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOADING

271
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:25,665
KIM JONG UN TO TEST A NUCLEAR

272
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:28,267
MISSILE AGAIN, TO PROVE ITS

273
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:30,770
RELIABILITY, TO SHOW HIM WRONG.

274
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,073
AND FUNDAMENTALLY, I THINK IT

275
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:35,108
COMES ACROSS AS TO

276
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:36,743
KINDERGARTNERS WHO ARE JOSTLING

277
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:39,278
EACH OTHER, EXCEPT EACH HAS

278
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:40,013
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

279
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:42,782
>> IT WAS TOO LATE, AFTER

280
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:44,651
100,000 AMERICANS DIED.

281
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:45,952
FOR AFTER A MILLION DIED.

282
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:49,088
>> AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE, THIS

283
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:49,689
IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION.

284
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:52,492
>> Sean: TRUMPS COMMENTS ABOUT

285
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:54,861
NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAVE EXPERTS

286
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:56,663
WORRY THAT HE COULD

287
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:58,698
INADVERTENTLY TRIGGER A

288
00:07:58,698 --> 00:07:59,098
CATASTROPHE.

289
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:00,266
TYPICAL CONSPIRACY THEORY.

290
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:01,968
THESE NUCLEAR TEST SO FAR, LET'S

291
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:02,669
GO THROUGH THIS.

292
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:05,071
NO MORE MISSILES FIRED OVER

293
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:06,239
JAPAN, GUAM IS NOT BEING

294
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,607
THREATENED AND ROUTE THE REGION

295
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:09,275
IS NOT BEING THREATENED.

296
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:10,943
WE DO HAVE THREE AMERICAN

297
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:11,944
HOSTAGES, THANK GOD THEY ARE

298
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:13,746
HOME AND HAVE BEEN FREED.

299
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:17,283
WHAT YOU SAW WAS JUST FAKE NEWS,

300
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:18,151
WE WATCHED KIM JONG UN WALK

301
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:20,086
ACROSS THE DMZ RIGHT INTO THE

302
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:21,554
ARMS OF THE SOUTH KOREAN

303
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:23,723
PRESIDENT, AND THE DISMANTLING

304
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:24,590
OF ONE OF HIS NUCLEAR TEST

305
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,091
SITES.

306
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:28,528
BECAUSE THIS IS 1 OF 3 EGREGIOUS

307
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:30,630
EXAMPLES OF FAKE NEWS THAT WE

308
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,998
ARE HIGHLIGHTING TONIGHT.

309
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:34,267
HERE'S NUMBER TWO.

310
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:37,437
OVER THERE, CONSPIRACY TV,

311
00:08:37,437 --> 00:08:39,472
MSNBC, THERE YOU GO.

312
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:40,873
THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES.

313
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:42,975
USUALLY MIKA SPENCER MORNING

314
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:44,010
PUSHING THEORIES ABOUT THE

315
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,978
PRESIDENTS MENTAL HEALTH WITH OF

316
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:48,648
COURSE JOE SCARBOROUGH, WHO IS

317
00:08:48,648 --> 00:08:49,882
THE LIBERAL.

318
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:52,351
BUT TODAY SHE VENTURED OUT ON

319
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:54,554
HER OWN AND FLOATED THIS INSANE

320
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:54,854
RUMOR.

321
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:57,090
>> I WILL TELL YOU A COUPLE OF

322
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,690
THINGS.

323
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,692
FIRST OF ALL, THE HYPOCRISY IS

324
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:00,326
ASTOUNDING BECAUSE I KNOW

325
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:02,562
SOMEONE WHO SPOKE TO

326
00:09:02,562 --> 00:09:03,296
DONALD TRUMP RECENTLY ABOUT LIFE

327
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:05,665
IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND IT

328
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:06,399
DONALD TRUMP'S BIGGEST COMPLAINT

329
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,571
WAS THAT HE IS NOT ALLOWED TO

330
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:18,511
WATCH IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

331
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:22,849
>> I BET THEY HAVE THOSE 1900

332
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:25,051
NUMBERS BLOCKED, TOO.

333
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:26,853
>> I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

334
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:28,421
>> Sean: ARE YOU PROUD OF

335
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:28,721
THAT?

336
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:30,890
DOES THIS IS WHAT IS SO CALLED

337
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,859
NEWS OVER THERE AT 30 ROCK?

338
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:36,062
THIS IS SO INSANE, HONESTLY, I

339
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:36,562
CAN'T EVEN BOTHER.

340
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:42,435
LET'S GO TO OUR THIRD.

341
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:45,638
YESTERDAY ON MY RADIO SHOW, I

342
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:47,540
MADE WHAT ARE OBVIOUSLY

343
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,508
SARCASTIC REMARKS HIGHLIGHTING A

344
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:50,109
CLEAR DOUBLE STANDARD AS IT

345
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:52,311
RELATES TO OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM.

346
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:54,147
EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW,

347
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:56,282
EQUAL APPLICATION OF OUR

348
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:57,049
NATION'S LAW.

349
00:09:57,049 --> 00:10:00,019
LAWS, AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT

350
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:01,754
HILLARY CLINTON AND COMPARING

351
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:04,724
HURTS TO WHAT SHE DID FOR THOSE

352
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:10,062
THAT HAVE BEEN TARGETED BY

353
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:11,464
MUELLER'S WITCH HUNT.

354
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:14,066
>> MAYBE MUELLER'S WITNESSES, I

355
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:14,467
DON'T KNOW.

356
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:18,938
IF I ADVISED THEM TO DELETE ALL

357
00:10:18,938 --> 00:10:20,706
OF YOUR EMAILS AND THEN ASKED TO

358
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:22,508
WASH THE EMAILS ON YOUR HARD

359
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:24,644
DRIVES AND PHONES, THEN TAKE

360
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:28,347
YOUR PHONES AND BASH THEM WITH A

361
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:30,550
HAMMER, USE BLEACH BIT, TAKE THE

362
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,186
SAME CARD, THEN HAND THE PIECES

363
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:34,620
TO ROBERT MUELLER AND SAY, AND

364
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,489
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, THIS IS

365
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:38,291
EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW.

366
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,592
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD

367
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:39,892
WORK?

368
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:42,962
I'M CERTAIN THE RESULT WOULD NOT

369
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:45,464
BE THE SAME AS HILLARY'S.

370
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:46,666
MUELLER WANTS EVERYONE

371
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,266
CELL PHONES.

372
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:49,669
MY ADVICE TO HIM WOULD BE, NOT

373
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:53,673
REALLY, I'M KIDDING, BAD ADVICE.

374
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:54,674
FOLLOW HILLARY'S LEADER.

375
00:10:54,674 --> 00:10:56,943

376
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:57,910
ACTUALLY MATTERED.

377
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,278
IF I TOLD THEM.

378
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:01,480
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE INSANE

379
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,816
LEFT-WING MEDIA IN THIS COUNTRY,

381
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:06,886
THEY PICKED UP THESE COMMENTS.

382
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:09,288
THEY ARE SO DUMB AND GULLIBLE.

383
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:12,091
THEY HAD A FULL ON, I CAN ONLY

384
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:13,392
DESCRIBE AS A FAKE NEWS FREAK

385
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:15,728

FROM THE BUSINESS INSIDER,

391
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,476
SEAN HANNITY SUGGESTS THAT COMEY

392
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:31,377
PROBE WITNESSES SHOULD DESTROY

393
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:32,478

TO DESTROY EVIDENCE.

405
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,693
AND "VANITY FAIR," SEAN HANNITY:

406
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:48,995
TRUMP ASSOCIATES, YOU ARE NOT

407
00:11:48,995 --> 00:11:54,066
OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE HARD ENOUGH.

408
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,868
BASHORE PHONES INTO PIECES.

409
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:58,871
"GQ" GOT INTO THE GAME.

410
00:11:58,871 --> 00:11:59,672
SEAN HANNITY ENCOURAGES COMEY

411
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:00,840
WITNESSES TO DO EVEN MORE CRIMES

412
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,742
THAN THEY HAVE ALREADY

413
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:03,109
COMMITTED.

414
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:06,279
I COULD GO ON FOR ANOTHER

415
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,281
20 MINUTES.

416
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:09,849
BUT THEN THAT HYSTERIA GETS EVEN

417
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:10,149
WORSE.

418
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:14,854
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW ANDY

419
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:16,088
LACK'S NETWORK HANDLE THIS.

420
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:17,757
>> SEAN HANNITY IS NOW TELLING

421
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:21,494
POTENTIAL WITNESSES AND SUBJECTS

422
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:27,400
IN THE COMEY PROBE TO DESTROY --

423
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,567
MUELLER PROBE TO DESTROY THEIR

424
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:29,468
PHONES.

425
00:12:29,468 --> 00:12:30,937
THEY MAY CALL THAT SARCASM OR

426
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:33,039
POETIC LICENSE, BUT WORDS ARE

427
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:33,873
WORDS.

428
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:34,573
SEAN HANNITY LIVES OFF OF HIS

429
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:36,242
WORDS AND WE ALL KNOW THEY HAVE

430
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:38,711
A HUGE IMPACT.

431
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:40,479
IF ANYONE ACTUALLY DOES WHAT

432
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,848
SEAN HANNITY SAYS THEY ARE, THEY

433
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:44,750
WOULD BE COMMITTING A CRIME.

434
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,355
>> WHAT SEAN HANNITY ADMITTED TO

435
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:50,756
WAS, AND ENTICING PEOPLE TO DO,

436
00:12:50,756 --> 00:12:52,091
IT WAS DESTROY EVIDENCE WHICH IS

437
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:54,860
A VIOLATION OF THE WITNESS

438
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,661
TAMPERING STATUTE.

439
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:58,965
>> NO RESPONSIBLE PERSON ON

440
00:12:58,965 --> 00:12:59,598
TELEVISION, NO RESPONSIBLE

441
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:00,733
SO-CALLED JOURNALISTS SHOULD BE

442
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,902
ADVOCATING FOR PEOPLE TO DESTROY

443
00:13:02,902 --> 00:13:05,438
EVIDENCE IN A SERIOUS FEDERAL

444
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:05,905
INVESTIGATION.

445
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:08,341
I DON'T THINK THAT WE WILL SEE

446
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:09,475
HIM PROSECUTED.

447
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:10,876
A FEDERAL PROSECUTORS GIVE

448
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:11,610
PEOPLE A VERY WIDE BERTH ON

449
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,081
FIRST AMENDMENT RELATED CONDUCT,

450
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,183
SO UNLESS THERE IS SOMETHING

451
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,084
MORE SPECIFIC TO LINK IT UP,

452
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:21,620
THIS WILL BE WHAT WE OFTEN

453
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,788
CATEGORIZE AS AWFUL BUT LAWFUL

454
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:23,289
CONDUCT.

455
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:26,359
>> IF HE WAS OUT THERE

456
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:28,961
ADVOCATING FOR MOLAR WITNESSES,

457
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:33,065
MAYBE THE MUELLER SHOULD SPEAK

458
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:34,100
TO HIM.

459
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,868
>> KNOWING MUELLER, I DON'T

460
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:37,269
THINK HE WILL LIGHT THAT FIRE

461
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:38,938
UNDER SOMEONE WHO GETS FREE

462
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:41,273
AIRTIME EVERY DAY.

463
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:43,275
BUT ONE ANGLE WOULD BE TO SAY,

464
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:44,977
I'M GOING TO A JUDGE AND I'M

465
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:47,079
GOING TO HAVE YOU CEASE AND

466
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:48,547
DESIST THIS ACTIVITY ON NATIONAL

467
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:49,482
TELEVISION.

468
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:50,716
SECONDLY, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU

469
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:52,151
AND SEE IF TRUMP HAS GOTTEN THIS

470
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:55,454
IDEA FROM YOU OR VICE VERSA.

471
00:13:55,454 --> 00:13:57,256
>> Sean: WORDS MATTER.

472
00:13:57,256 --> 00:13:58,257
IF I DEVISE THEM?

473
00:13:58,257 --> 00:13:59,692
AND BY THE WAY, IT'S REALLY

474
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:02,061
DUMB, IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT

475
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:03,863
WELL FOR YOU.

476
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:06,499
THE GREAT IRONY IN ALL OF THIS

477
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,701
IS, THEY ARE MORE ANGRY THAT I

478
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:10,136
WAS BASICALLY SAYING THAT

479
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:10,836
HILLARY CLINTON DID IT ALL.

480
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:13,672
SHE DID EVERY BIT OF IT.

481
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:14,807
AND BY THE WAY, I LOVE THE IDEA.

482
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:20,112
I WOULD LIKE TO MEET ROBERT

483
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:23,883
MUELLER'S MARY BRAND.

484
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:25,084
I WOULD LIKE TO MEET THAT MAN

485
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:28,521
WHO PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR A

486
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:30,956
YEAR TO BE OVERTURNED BY THE

487
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:32,458
FIFTH CIRCUIT THAT WAS

488
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,659
EXCORIATED BY JUDGES NOT ONCE

489
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:36,262
BUT TWICE AND COSTING TENS OF

490
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:38,464
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE JOBS.

491
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,900
I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR HIM AND

492
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,837
JEANNIE RAY AND BOB MUELLER.

493
00:14:44,837 --> 00:14:45,871
NOW, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WOULD

494
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:47,440
PUT ME UNDER INVESTIGATION AND

495
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,075
LOCK ME UP FOR MERELY

496
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:49,809
HIGHLIGHTING AND THEN OBVIOUSLY

497
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:50,476
SARCASTIC WAY THE DOUBLE

498
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:52,111
STANDARD AND WHAT I HAVE BEEN

499
00:14:52,111 --> 00:14:55,648
POINTING OUT OUR TWO-TIER

500
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:56,282
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

501
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:57,716
IN THE SAME PEOPLE DON'T GET THE

502
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:59,485
FACT THAT HILLARY ACTUALLY DID

503
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:00,486
ALL OF THAT.

504
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:05,291
SHE WIPED AWAY, ACID WASHED HER

505
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,294
HARD DRIVE, DELETED EMAILS OR

506
00:15:08,294 --> 00:15:08,994
SUBPOENAED, HAD AIDS SMASHING

507
00:15:08,994 --> 00:15:10,863
PHONES WITH A HAMMER AND LIED

508
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:13,466
ABOUT ALL OF IT.

509
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:14,533
ARE YOU REALLY THAT DUMB?

510
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:18,471
TELL ME IT'S NOT TRUE.

511
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:20,539
YOU WOULD THINK THAT ONE UNDER

512
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:21,941
MUELLER'S PLAN WOULD BE ABLE TO

513
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:23,342
GET AWAY WITH THAT.

514
00:15:23,342 --> 00:15:24,877
IF ROBERT MUELLER ASK FOR YOUR

515
00:15:24,877 --> 00:15:26,278
PHONE, DON'T DO WHAT HILLARY

516
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:26,545
DID.

517
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:28,914
AS I SAID LAST NIGHT, A WARM AND

518
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:29,682
WELL FOR YOU.

519
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:31,383
YOU WON'T GET THE SAME

520
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:32,518
TREATMENT, WHICH WAS A POINT OF

521
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:33,319
IT.

522
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:34,487
NOW THE MEDIA, WHEN YOU THINK

523
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:36,155
THEY HAVE HIT A NEW LOW, THEY

524
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:39,058
JUST DIG AND DIG AND DIG.

525
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:40,292
ONE MORE NEWS STORY THAT THE

526
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:43,896
MEDIA HATES TO, THE PRESIDENT

527
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:44,497
GRANTED CLEMENCY.

528
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:46,899
THE WOMAN'S NAME WAS ALICE

529
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:47,633
JOHNSON, A GREAT-GRANDMOTHER AND

530
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,101
SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR

531
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:51,237
ONE NONVIOLENT DRUG CRIME.

532
00:15:51,237 --> 00:15:53,372
20 SOME ODD YEARS IN JAIL.

533
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:55,708
HER FIRST DAY IN FREEDOM IN 20

534
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,109
YEARS, SHE THINKS THE PRESIDENT

535
00:15:57,109 --> 00:15:59,111
AND MOMENTS AGO SHE SPOKE WITH

536
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:00,079
OUR OWN MARTHA MacCALLUM.

537
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,580
>> THE ONLY WAY THAT I WAS ABLE

538
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,781
TO MAKE IT THROUGH THAT TIME,

539
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:05,317
AND THIS IS THE TRUTH, IT WAS MY

540
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:05,784
FAITH IN GOD.

541
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:07,920
I KNEW THAT ONE DAY HE WAS GOING

542
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,056
TO BRING ME OUT AND I LIVE MY

543
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:12,658
LIFE WITH AN EYE TOWARD IT ONE

544
00:16:12,658 --> 00:16:13,893
DAY WALKING OUT OF THOSE DOORS A

545
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:14,293
FREE WOMAN.

546
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:16,495
IN THE DAY I GOT THE NEWS THAT

547
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:17,329
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TO GRANTED

548
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:18,497
MY CLEMENCY AND GIVEN ME A

549
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:21,433
SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE WAS THE

550
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,535
BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

551
00:16:22,535 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Sean: GOD BLESS YOU, WE
