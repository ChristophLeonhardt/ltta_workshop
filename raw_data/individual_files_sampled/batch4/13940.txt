so I often hear Christians say that they pray and their prayers don't work we're not getting results it's like a diet plan or something you know I've been doing it I've just I'm just not shedding the pounds I don't know what's wrong I have no doubt complain about this in the past myself and the problem is that people become discouraged from prayer because they perceive that it's not having the desired effect and then they stop doing it and that's how you end up with a body of believers in America who don't pray we have an unprecedented in American and it shows a the statistics that I've read I don't know if they're true or not but they sound true it's probably true I've read that the average Christian spends significantly significantly less than 10 minutes a day praying I've also read that the number is actually about one minute a day that the average Christian spends in prayer and that's pretty bad especially when you consider that the average person spends five hours a day watching TV which I don't know I mean that's mind boggling I don't know how do you find five hours in the day to sit on a couch and just stare at a screen how could you possibly carve out that much time and how do you not get bored but anyway five hours a day watching TV several more hours a day staring at computer screens and phones for wasting a lot of time and yet we say I don't know I just I just can't find the time to pray I got a guy yeah I can't find it in my schedule I've got my schedule right here from from about 7:00 p.m. till 1:00 a.m. I'm gonna be watching TV can't do anything about that I mean that's you know I've had that's scheduled for weeks now so I thought it would be a good thing maybe to talk about prayer and to talk about why our prayers may not be working why they may not be answered from our perspective and here are just a few points about a few points about prayer the first thing should understand is that God does answer every prayer said to him crucial thing there is that qualifier said to him if we pray to somebody else that's not him then he's not necessarily going to answer that prayer and if we're praying for fame and fortune and materialistic selfish greedy prideful things if we are praying to satisfy our gluttony and pride and ego and materialism that's how we're praying then we're not praying to God we may be attaching his name to it but we're praying to some kind of genie that grants wishes that's what we're pranking we're basically praying to the genie from Aladdin that's who are praying to and that's not God we in other words we are praying to an idol we are idol-worshipping the person who tells that the person who says a selfish materialistic greedy prayer is an idol worshiper if God responds to that prayer at all we're probably not gonna like the response just put it that way so just a quick story about that and I'm embarrassed to say that's a long time ago when I was I don't know 20 or 21 years old I actually literally did pray for a winning lottery ticket maybe twice in my life I've I've purchased one of those jackpot lotteries tickets and so I this is this was one of those times I think it was a I don't know it was a 300 million 400 million dollar jackpot and so before they drew the numbers that night I set a prayer to God dear Lord let me win this 300 million topics Lord please I don't ask for much just please 300 million dollars it's all I need okay then I'll be happy I did pray for that and it's it's a shameful blasphemous prayer especially when you consider that Christ in the gospel is is repeatedly warns us about wealth and he says famously it's very difficult for a rich man to get to heaven like passing through the eye of a needle and why is that because because the more wealth we have the more things we have the more attached we be we become to those things and the less attached we are to God and the more that our our kind of vision our our view of the divine of holy sacred things the more that view is cluttered and blocked by all of this stuff and that's why he tells us give up everything give up all this stuff and just follow me so when I prayed for 300 million dollars what I was really praying for was God please make it hard for me to get to heaven fortunately thank God he did not grant that prayer I did not win the money and in fact not only did I not win it but for the next five years of my life I had pretty serious financial difficulty and I was pretty poor and I had a lot of trouble just keeping the lights on and putting food in the fridge and that's how I lived in my in my dumpy little apartment for about five years now I'm not saying that that was all a direct result of the prayer that I said for 300 million dollars but I don't think it's entirely unrelated I think God and his wisdom may choose so withhold blessings from greedy selfish childish people like I was at the time people who treat him like a genie he may say you know what I'm gonna withhold now you're gonna go without for a while and that wit that withholding of a blessing that thing where we we pray for something and then God gives us the opposite of what we prayed for which is kind of what happened to me more than once in my life but that itself is a huge blessing and I realize now looking back how good it was that I was poor during that time because if I had if I had money and means I would have probably used it in selfish ways because I was a selfish person and I would have destroyed myself and so praise God he did not he didn't go with my plan he went with his now I know that most Christians hopefully aren't praying for hundreds of millions of dollars you know most Christians hopefully aren't as stupid as I was at the time but there are many other forms of materialistic selfish prayers prayer that is essentially just gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme and if such prayers are answered at all they're more likely to be answered with rebuke and what I will say is if we do pray selfishly and materialistically and greedily and suddenly we look around and we see that all of our selfish desires are actually coming true well then we should shudder in fear because those blessings are not coming from God he is God is not going to indulge our sinful desires God's not going to do that if we want something sinful God is not gonna say okay here you go so if those blessings aren't coming from God above then they're coming from below and that's not to say that everyone who's ever got wealthy you know they that those were blood that those were gifts from Satan I'm not saying that I'm saying someone who is intensely focused selfishly on materialistic things and someone who is greedy when they look around and see that things are starting to go their way well I think it's must be much more likely that that's Satan kind of walking in front of them and paving paving the path and making things very comfortable for them so that they'll just walk very nicely and very easily right into hell second thing kind of related to the first point scripture tells us to pray unceasingly persistently and if we're only praying briefly in this kind of scattershot way and only when we want something even if what we want is not selfish or materialistic even if it's a good thing well then that prayer isn't gonna necessarily work and that's because God desires an intimate bond with us he doesn't want to stand off at the dead at a distance and just toss crumbs to us he he wants to be our eternal bread he wants us to be sustained by him through His grace and he wants us to establish a real connection with them a real relationship so if we pray just every once in a while and only when we want something it again could be a great blessing I think that he doesn't give us what we want he'll answer the prayer but he may answer it by saying no or he may say you want that but I'm gonna give you this instead and we may get that answer kind of frequently if we're not praying habitually and unceasingly you know if we just pray every once awhile when we want something nothing more then we may get turned down quite a bit because he's withholding the fullness of his blessings in order to spur us to greater hunger and a greater desperation for his presence and that is what God wants he wants desperation I think God really wants us to be desperate people he wants us to be desperate like a like a man in the desert who hasn't had a drink of water in two days that's what he wants and that's why in Scripture you'll notice he never made it particularly easy for those who came to him the people that came to him asking for healing and asking for miracles he didn't often make it easy for them they had to fight through a crowd right like the woman who grabbed on Christ's robe shoulda said there's throngs of people she had a fight and just and just you know she's probably on probably crawling and it she grabs at his roams and that's what was necessary to demonstrate her faith and that's how she was healed tear the roof off of a house remember the paralytic in the Gospels and they had to they couldn't get in Christ was inside a house they couldn't get in through the doors too many people so they had to climb up on the on the roof and tear a hole on the roof to get to Jesus or they had to travel great distances or you have in Matthew chapter 9 we read about the two blind men who are following Jesus and shouting have mercy on me have mercy on me and eventually when Jesus makes it to the place where he was going and they followed him all the way there then he turns around and heals them but they had to follow that whole time he could have healed them at any money he could have taken two steps and then turned around and said yeah you're healed but instead he had these men who blind he had these literally blind men follow him over we don't know how long it was but we can assume as a bit of a distance and to keep following keep shouting a mercy on me have mercy on me and then he healed them so Jesus didn't go door to door handing out blessings instead he walked his path he journeyed where he needed to go where his mission meant that he had to go and it was up to the people to seek him and humble themselves before him and ask for his blessings in faith you know Jesus says knock and the door will be open and I know Christians will cite that verse a lot and they'll say oh just whatever you pray for you'll get ya knock and the doors open he'd ever said knock once he didn't say how many times you might have to knock you might have to knock 10 times you might have to knock a hundred times you might have to you might have to knock ten thousand times before he finally answers it he says um he says seek and you will find he never said that you're gonna find it the first place you look he never said this process of seeking will take five seconds could take five days could take five years could take fifty years whatever it is so we have to be persistent and unceasing and keep coming back to God keep coming back keep coming back keep crying out to him and and that's really what demonstrates our faith because anyone can cry out to God in a moment of desperation you know in a fleeting moment of desperation or a fleeting moment of need anyone can cry out oh god help me save but to continue to continue following God grasping at his robes crying out at mercy i'ma need to continue along that path well that's persistence that's unceasing prayer I think the third thing I think a lot of us need to expand our prayer arsenal a little bit because there are different kinds of Prayer not just one kind and I think this is a big problem in Christianity today in the West is that people aren't really taught about prayer we kind of assume that it's oh yeah you'll figure it out you know you'll pick it up on your own it's something people need to be taught and trained in and we need to learn that there are different kinds of prayers there are prayers of petitions where we ask for something and we've discussed that and I think for a lot of us that's the only kind of prayer we ever say it's just petition God give me this give me this give me this and we may we may we may ask for petitions we may petition on behalf of other people which is great we may petition on behalf of our children our family or spouse yet the poor the disadvantaged our friends and those are great prayers to say but those are also petitioned prayers and then you also have prayers of Thanksgiving where we give thanks and praise to God and I think if we're getting shot down on our petition prayers a lot we may have to ask ourselves how often do we do the Thanksgiving prayers because of its all petition and its no Thanksgiving except for maybe on Thanksgiving that's the only time when we thank God that might be part of the problem it seems to me it should be at least even for all the time we spend asking God for things we should spend time thanking him taking him even when he says no if he says yes to a prayer and I know I've done it so many times where I'm praying for something I'm praying for it and then I get it forget to go back to God and say thank you for this and I know I don't tolerate that for my own kids if I go out and get them some ice cream and I hand them the ice cream they better say thank you but how often have I done that to our Heavenly Father or he gives me something and I'm just like a brat I don't even say thank you for it but I think even more common even if we remember to say thank you for the yeses how often do we forget to say thank you for the nose because even if God says no should still go back and thank him because we know that the know was what was best for us and so it was a blessing even still I'm so prayers of Thanksgiving prayers of petition then we have prayers of contrition where we ask forgiveness for our sins that's another one that I think Christians tend to neglect in their one minute of daily prayer and then there are prayers of adoration and a prayer of adoration is a prayer where we simply worship and praise God now you look at the Lord's Prayer which Christ gave to us we see that has it has all of these elements in it so think about it our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name that's adoration thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven that's more adoration give us this day our daily bread that's petition forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us that's contrition lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil that's also petition so this is the model prayer Jesus says pray like this and he's not saying that every prayer you say should be this specific prayer these words exactly although we should pray that specific prayer a lot but what he what he's saying is every prayer you should you say should reflect this prayer it should reflect some element of this prayer so it leads with adoration praise worship dwelling in God's holiness then it petitions God but the petition is humble the petition is submissive it's saying just give me my daily bread Lord then there's asking for forgiveness and it's kind of a it's it's kind of a dangerous a request for forgiveness were saying forgive us as we forgive others don't forgive others that will and then there's the final petition which is a petition for holiness and for sanctification and I think when we're asking God for things that should really be the main thing we ask for is for our sanctification for our holiness we should be saying you know make me holy Lord fourth thing or to focus on a duration prayers for a moment because I I think this is the kind of prayer that is most lacking for a lot of Christians and it was lacking for me until recently not every prayer that we say should involve us saying anything not every prayer should be said if we really desire a connection a relationship with him then the conversation with God has to be a two-way conversation and I think a mistake that we often make is this is a conversation we we are really bad conversationalist okay we're like the conversationalist in the conversation who just dominates the conversation it makes everything about themselves and never listens to anybody else and it's just horrible talking to them I think with God it's got to be a two-way conversation all the time we spend talking to him explaining ourselves and everything there also have to be times of silence times of listening prayers you know we should be saying prayers where we say nothing actually where we ask for nothing but we simply put ourselves in his presence we meditate upon his Majesty and lordship and beauty and we open ourselves up there and then we just sit there in his presence thinking about him that's kind of that's a that's a contemplative meditative prayer people have different sorts of strategies for contemplative prayer I'm certainly no expert myself what I try to do now try being the operative word working on it but what I try to do is is I try to do this every morning the contemplative prayer and I begin by reading a little bit of Scripture just a short passage so as so as to put myself in the right frame of mind and then the next step for me is is I get on my knees and I do think that the physical posture is important because we are physical beings and to be on our knees is to physically communicate our submission to God and the whole point of contemplative prayer is to is to meditate upon the presence of God so we have to think if Christ were to appear in the flesh right in front of us if if Christ walked into our living room in the flesh what would we do unless we are arrogant beyond all comprehension we would fall to our knees we probably fall all the way prostrate on our faces is what we would do remember in Revelation John talks about his vision of the Lord and he says when I saw him I fell at his feet as though dead and that is what a person ought to do when confronted with the blinding heavenly light of perfection so if we're praying whenever possible I think it's important to put our minds where our minds need to be by putting our bodies how our bodies need to be and I'm not saying that every time we pray we have to be on our knees because I know you know some pray sometimes when I'm driving when I'm walking when I'm doing chores you know it's so so we could pray in any physical position whatsoever but we should also be carving out specific time in the day for prayer not just when we can fit it in when we're doing something else which is fine as long as we also have that time that is just for prayer nothing else put aside all the distractions and in those moments I think it's so important for us to get on our knees in this of submission and reverence and this is something that I think is really lacking not just prayer but something really lacking among Christians in America is reverence is this sense of total reverence this sense of the sacred you know that we are in front of something truly sacred so anyway then on my knees I ask the Holy Spirit to come into my heart and then I spend some time saying nothing trying not to say anything even in my head trying to cancel out any thoughts of things that I need or things I need to do and I just imagined myself before Christ and that's the prayer I know some people in Crowe template prayer they'll they'll meditate on the passage of Scripture or they'll meditate on the cross I think over time you figure out what works best for you what's the best way that God speaks to you personally but I think this should really be the bedrock of our prayer life that private quiet contemplation that passive kind of receiving of God and receiving of him you know him speaking to us but if we really want to hear what he's saying to us we need to just shut up and listen which I know we all struggle with I certainly do but I think when we incorporate all of these forms of Prayer and we pray unceasingly and we really start to take our prayer life seriously I think that's when we see that our prayers really start to work they really work and they work in many ways but but here's the primary way that I think a really a really well grounded prayer life works or here's here's the place if you're really praying a lot and you're praying well here's the place where you're really gonna see a change you may not see a change in anything else your financial situation may stay the same your your health may stay the same everything in your life may stay exactly the same or they may not but it may all stay exactly the same but the one place where you were absolutely 100% guaranteed see a change is in your appetites I don't mean physical appetites I mean that when we really have a prayer life that's when we start to feel a deeper desire for holy things the more we pursue God the more of a desire we have for him and we start to crave these we start to crave holiness and so we feel less desire for the hollow things it's we want holy things not hollow things not superficial things not not unholy things our spiritual and intellectual appetites grow deeper they grow more mature we may find that a lot of the music we like to listen to a lot of the shows we watch a lot of the movies we watch just a lot of the stuff we used to do no longer has any appeal to us whatsoever and we'll even find that certain sins and certain temptations that we've struggled with that have had it that have just had it hold on us for so long suddenly they don't have a hold on us anymore suddenly and you might not even notice it when it happens it's not that you'll become a perfect person who never sins but if there are certain sins that have just had you in their grasp for so long and then you really start praying unceasingly every day constantly that's when you find that that in it you almost don't even notice the transition but one day you look and that sin is just kind of over there and you can look at it and you can say you've got no power on me you've got no power and you'll just want more of the sacred in your life and you'll find that certain things that you found appealing before aren't appealing anymore certain things you didn't find appealing are appealing you'll love people more you'll hate sin more you'll want to read the Bible more you'll want to think about God more and talk about him more I think when you look at Christians who it would seem that their appetites are exactly like everyone else's in other words they're you know they're just they're listening to trashy music and they're just watching all this trash on TV and they're just living and consuming in exactly the same way as people without faith and they seem to have no appetite whatsoever for God prayer Church scripture well the reason why they're like that is that they don't pray that's that's the problem is they don't pray and I think then the more we change from prayer the less we look at prayer as a thing that brings results or a thing that works or doesn't work we just see prayer as an opportunity to spend time with God and to think about him and worship Him and not always to be asking for things but just to have our bond with him grow stronger and stronger and to be in his presence and to listen to him I don't say this as someone who's mastered the art of praying not by a long shot but I know that this is what prayer is and we could all certainly benefit from praying significantly more than we are now so maybe we should all make that resolve make that resolution right now all right I'll leave it there thanks for watching everybody god speed you
