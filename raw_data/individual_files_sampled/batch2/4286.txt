democratic mountain my god stop Democratic nominee for Florida comes Rock Andrew Gilliam led in every public poll can you believe that primary win late last month I can while his Republican opponent Ron de santis is having some issues he's reportedly not ready to discuss the issues yet too early it's too soon it is been in Congress streets are you running well made Congress three times well why are you running I only run it ran against a guy that was one of the most qualified public figures in all of the Tampa Bay Times writes that during the Republican primary dissent disappeared multiple times a week on Fox News but almost always talked about national issues such as the special councils Russia probe and that he rarely made himself available for one-on-one interviews or invited journalists to hear him talk with voters according to Smith the DeSantis campaign confirmed several days ago that he would sit down with the Tampa Bay Times to discuss his position on issues facing Florida but the campaign canceled Tuesday morning saying they wanted to give two Santa's time to flush out his platform Wow before taking Ruston so this guy's running by the way he announced his candidacy in January this guy is running Mike to be governor of a state it's got a gdp that's greater than most countries has hurricanes coming in it seems every few weeks in the fall it is a hard state to run that's why you know I'd say I said the Jeb Bush is the single best public official I've ever seen in my life it's because Jeff got a Jeb going in knew more than everybody else in the entire he just he was steeped in knowledge about the state of Florida steeped and knowledge about how you save people during a hurricane wasn't running around you know talking about nursery rhymes or there storia yeah which is such a joke a what what were the Republicans in that state if they not been through as many hurricanes as I'd been through in Florida to pick a guy who basically ran a joke of a campaign and doesn't know what the hell he's doing right now well given the fact that you're a young man probably the vets right my question is not having followed mrs. DeSantis career as much as they ought to have I guess I have a couple of questions is he a recent arrival in Florida do you move there like so many people for tax purposes now he's he's been there for a while yeah there for a while I'm dissented I don't think he's been there as long as I've been there but he's been there for a while so the idea that he has not sat down with multiple local units thus far Tampa Bay Sarasota yes Fort Myers Miami that he hasn't sat down with reporters or news organizations in those areas and hasn't talked about you know what he's gonna do about you know highways and bridge construction and now you know and in the wake of hurricane season what he would do in terms of an emergency and that emergency always comes in you have to have somebody who's competent not a guy who you know Susan when he's asked by a reporter what his position is on land use in Florida he says I like purple I mean that's not gonna get it I mean imagine you're sitting there in Florida you you see Florence coming in you see what Carolina South Carolina are doing and you're going to vote for someone who does not know what his policies are forget knowing what to do if there's an emergency I mean if there's ever such a stark difference and yes it's it's a mayor that he's running against Bert you know but that means that you're used to operational procedures and that you know how to get things done it this is what's happened in the age of Trump it's the Fox primary candidates go on Fox as much as they can they try and win a state or when their district whatever they're looking for and they come up empty after they're done with that because they have not been through the wringer and go through the interviews and everything else that you need they're just focused on winning that prize by the way Willie you know I love senators why don't we tell you all the time I love senator all of them every one of them all 107 wonderful people strange salt of the earth great good 9 but you can if you're a senator and you're dumb you can kind of hide in the back of the chamber for a couple of years until you figure things out not talking about anyone specifically salt of the earth I love the senators but if you're governor of a state of Florida this is true and you got a hurricane for a category four or a cat5 coming at you there is no place to run baby no place to hide and I said watching I just could not believe that the state of Florida Republican primary voters had a chance to elect a guy in Adam Putnam and I said nice things about him that probably hurt that was as qualified as anybody I've ever seen to run for governor instead they pick a guy who goes on Fox News talks about how he wants to obstruct a Russian investigation and doesn't even understand any of these issues thankfully this isn't even about winning or losing but if he wins what's gonna happen the first time the cat four starts barreling down he's going to take some time off you know flush out these she starts going cuts get sucked into the Gulf and starts moving towards Pensacola you know not good here's a headline from the Tampa Bay Times a couple days ago Rhonda Santa's still keeping his distance from Florida issues that's a hell of a headline he doesn't want to talk about the issues in Florida but Florida has an interesting choice here because Andrew Gilliam has put out proposals that are I would say not far left but pretty darn progressive medicare-for-all he's on board with abolishing ice $15 minimum wage and then on the other hand you have Ron de santis whose primary strategy appears to be hugging Donald Trump reporters are enemies to the people he said he had some sympathy for that point of view he wants everyone to know that I will be lockstep with Donald Trump and that is the strategy that is in us he states that Donald Trump is still pretty popular in all things being equal but you also have with Gilliam one other fundamental problem I think he's going to face is he admits he has to raise taxes and that's not going to play well in Florida because you could go through everything else but raising taxes in Florida is a big issue yeah so Joe what what do you think the consensus would be in terms of Jeb Bush if as a lot of people suspect the Santas campaign really gets ugly mm-hmm what does Jeb Bush do does he endorse him no boy I don't I don't think so no I'm not sure he knows who he is kind of surprised that George Dougie's going out campaigning for Republicans I mean I understand why see he's fun yes for Republicans because every Republican you send to Washington DC you send somebody to vote against an investigation that I'm sure George W thinks should be investigated but boy I would find it hard to believe that Jeb Bush would ever endorse Ron DeSantis Adam Putnam in a second because the guy actually would know what what he's doing yeah but this guy just again this this guy doesn't understand the issues he's having to take time out to figure out exactly what he believes and we're in hurricane season it's just a toxic it's a toxic mix and it reminds me of what my friend David Stafford said when we were driving over to Katrina and we were going over every day Mississippi Louisiana and he said he very conservative guy but he said and I've said this before on the show he said you know why we're at this position where we've got a mayor and we've got a governor and we've got a president don't know what they're doing because we all go in and we vote in primary season and if we're a Democrat we check the box are they pro-life are they this are and if we're Republicans we check the box get our pro-choice or pro-life and they go down they check all the ideological boxes but the one box that is left out and this ideological era is leadership and they don't look at leadership can actually get us through a hurricane Katrina and so we get what we deserve well still ahead on Morning Joe by the time I left office household income was near its all-time high and the uninsured rate had hit an all-time low and wages were rising and poverty rates were falling I mentioned all this just so when you hear how great the economy is doing right now let's just remember when this recovery started okay last week former President Obama argued that President Trump is just riding the Obama economic policy wave but does Trump deserve more credit our next guest says yes and we'll hear those arguments coming up on Morning Joe thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay
