1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,005
“Congratulations.”
“Thank you so much.”

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:04,697
“Congratulations.”
“Can I have a hug?”

3
00:00:04,697 --> 00:00:05,737
“Yes indeed.”

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,390
“Everyone is saying 
it’s a surprise victory.”

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,010
“Oh my God!”

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,090
“She’s looking at herself
on television right now.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,820
How are you feeling?

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,050
Can you put it into words?”

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,700
“Nope.”

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,555
I’m good. It’s a 
whirlwind. It’s crazy.

11
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:29,352
When we vote,

12
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:31,290
this is what happens.

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,540
This is the change
that’s possible.

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,575
This race is about people
versus money.

15
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:41,425
We’ve got people,
they’ve got money.

16
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:43,075
Hi, this is Alexandria Ocasio.

17
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,950
Well, I think what it means
is that working-class Americans

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,320
are ready and
willing and eager to hear

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,520
a message of economic,
social and racial justice

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,410
and a plan.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,890
Just being unapologetic
about what I believe

22
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,310
and what my values were and
to be very honest about what

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,850
I thought the path forward
was and also showing people

24
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,410
how I was
walking the walk now.”

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,050
“I had my whole family 
vote for you.”

26
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,050
“Oh my God, thank you.”

27
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,800
“Thank you so much.
I can’t believe it.”

28
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:19,550
“O.K.”

29
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,160
“We gotta get the selfie.”

30
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,870
“Congratulations.”

31
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,905
“Hi, thank you.

32
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:23,770
I hope
that this ushers

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,660
in an era where
we kind of expand

34
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,220
what it means to
be a candidate,

35
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,990
expand who can be 
a candidate

36
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,290
in this time.

37
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,810
What this race
has really shown

38
00:01:32,810 --> 00:00:00,000
is that anything is possible.”
