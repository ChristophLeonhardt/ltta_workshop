>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
>> GOOD MORNING.
FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST JOINING US
I'M TOM LLAMAS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST SIGNED THE 
$1.5 TRILLION TAX BILLMENT AN 
IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR THE 
ADMINISTRATION AND COUNTRY.
THIS LIKELY WILL AFFECT 
EVERYONE'S TAXES.
A PROMISE HE CAMPAIGNED ON TO 
OVERHAUL OUR TAX SYSTEM.
WITH HIS SIGNATURE THIS WILL BE 
THE BIGGEST REWRITE IN A 
GENERATION OF OUR TAX CODE.
REPUBLICANS FEEL IT WILL LEAD TO
HIGHER WAGES AND MORE JOBS.
DEMOCRATS CALLED IT A TAX CUT 
FOR THE RICH AND BIG BUSINESS.
THE VAST MAJORITY OF TAX PAYERS 
WILL SEE A LOWER TAX BILL BUT IT
COULD EXPIRE FROM 2025.
A FEED HAS COME IN FROM THE 
WHITE HOUSE.
WE WANT TO GO THERE RIGHT ABOUT 
NOW.
>> GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING 
HERE.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY NEW YEAR,
GREAT HOLIDAYS.
WE'RE GOING TO SIGN SOME VERY 
IMPORTANT THINGS TODAY.
ONE IS A CONTINUING RESOLUTION 
THAT VERY IMPORTANTLY GIVES US 
THE RIGHT AND WE ARE ORDERING $4
BILLION WORTH OF MISSILE DEFENSE
EQUIPMENT AND MISSILES 
THEMSELVES.
VERY IMPORTANT, TOP OF THE LINE,
BEST IN THE WORLD.
WE MAKE THE BEST MILITARY 
PRODUCT IN THE WORLD.
NOBODY IS EVEN CLOSE.
WE'RE ORDERING $4 BILLION WORTH 
OF MISSILE DEFENSE.
THAT WILL BE DONE BY SIGNING 
RIGHT HERE AND BY NOTIFYING THE 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND 
PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE 
DESIGNATING THE MISSILE DEFENSE 
AS AN EMERGENCY DEFENSE FUND.
IT'S $4 BILLION FOR THAT AND 
$700 MILLION FOR OTHER MILITARY 
EQUIPMENT.
OUR MILITARY HAS BEEN DOING A 
FANTASTIC JOB WITH ISIS AND 
EVERYTHING THEY'VE BEEN TOUCHING
LATELY HAS BEEN WORKING OUT.
WE'RE SIGNING THAT.
>>> THIS IS THE LETTER TO MITCH 
McCONNELL AND SEPARATELY TO PAUL
RYAN AUTHORIZING THAT HAVING TO 
DO WITH MISSILE 
DEFENSE.
OKAY.
VERY IMPORTANT.
SO THAT'S BEING DONE TODAY.
THAT'S GOING TO BE SENT OUT.
>>> THEN WHEN I WATCH THE NEWS, 
AS YOU KNOW WE HAD THE LARGEST 
TAX CUTS IN OUR HISTORY JUST 
APPROVED AND I WAS GOING TO WAIT
FOR A FORMAL SIGNING SOMETIME IN
EARLY JANUARY.
THEN I WATCHED THE NEWS THIS 
MORNING.
THEY WERE ALL SAYING WILL HE 
KEEP HIS PROMISE, WILL HE SIGN 
IT BY CHRISTMAS.
YOU WERE ONE.
WILL HE SIGN IT BY CHRISTMAS?
I CALLED DOWNSTAIRS AND SAID GET
IT READY.
WE HAVE TO SIGN IT NOW.
WE WERE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL 
JANUARY 7th OR 8th AND DO A BIG 
FORMAL SIGNING.
EVERYONE OF THE NETWORKS WAS 
SAYING WILL HE KEEP HIS PROMISE 
AND SIGN IT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
I IMMEDIATELY CALLED AND SAID 
LET'S GET IT READY.
$3.2 TRILLION IN TAX CUTS FOR 
AMERICAN FAMILIES INCLUDING THE 
DOUBLING OF THE STANDARD DID HE 
D
DEDUCTION OF THE CHILD TAX 
CREDIT.
WE SEE AN INCOME TAX CUT OF MORE
THAN $2,000, MANY MUCH HIGHER 
THAN THAT SLASHING THEIR TAX 
BILL IN HALF.
THEY'RE GOING TO START TO SEE 
THAT BECAUSE WE'RE SIGNING 
TODAY.
THEY'RE GOING TO START TO SEE 
THAT IN FEBRUARY.
THE NUMBERS WILL SPEAK.
ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS THAT 
WILL HAPPEN.
I WANT TO THANK AT&T WHO WAS THE
FIRST OUT OF THE BOX AND BEAUING
AND SIN CLAIR AND COMCAST EVEN 
THOUGH THEY OWN NBC WHICH IS NOT
SO NICE TO THE PRESIDENT.
COMCAST, THEY ALSO HAVE MADE 
TREMENDOUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
THEIR EMPLOYEES AND TREMENDOUS 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO SPENDING MONEY 
IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE 
TAX BILL.
THEY ALL SAID IT'S BECAUSE OF 
THE TAX BILL.
THEY'RE MAKING TREMENDOUS 
INVESTMENTS.
THAT MEANS JOBS AND A LOT OF 
THINGS.
AT&T, BOEING, COMCAST.
A FRIEND OF MINE BOB CRAFT 
CALLED ME LAST NIGHT AND SAID 
THIS TAX BILL IS INCREDIBLE.
HE OWNS THE NEW ENGLAND 
PATRIOTS, BUT HE'S IN THE PAPER 
BUSINESS TOO.
HE SAID HE'S GOING TO BUY A BIG 
PLANT IN THE GREAT STATE OF 
NORTH CAROLINA AND HE'S GOING TO
BUILD A TREMENDOUS PAPER MILL 
THERE OR PAPER PRODUCTS PLANT.
I'VE HAD MANY CALLS SUCH AS THAT
WHERE PEOPLE THAT ARE 
ENTREPRENEURS ARE GOING OUT AND 
GOING TO BUY FACTORIES THAT ARE 
CLOSED, ABANDONED.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE 
ABANDONED ANY LONGER.
IT'S HAVING AN EVEN BIGGER 
IMPACT FASTER THAN I THOUGHT.
THE CORPORATE TAX RATE LOWERED 
FROM 35% TO 21%.
THAT MEANS MORE PRODUCTS MADE IN
THE U.S.A.
A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING IN THE
U.S.A.
WE'LL BRING BACK OUR COMPANIES.
THEY'VE ALREADY STARTED COMING 
BACK.
THEY HAD CONFIDENCE IN ME.
THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED.
SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO ME, THE 
FAMILY FARMERS AND SMALL WAS 
OWNERS WHO LOST THEIR BUSINESS 
BECAUSE OF THE ESTATE TAX, MOST 
WON'T HAVE ANY ESTATE TAX TO 
PAY.
YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR FARM TO YOUR 
FAMILY, YOUR SMALL BUSINESS TO 
YOUR FAMILY.
NOT EVEN SO SMALL.
THE NUMBERS ARE PRETTY BIG HERE.
THEY'LL BE KMEXEMPT FROM PAYING 
ESTATE TAX.
BUSINESSES WILL BE ABLE TO 
DEDUCT 100% OF THEIR CAPITAL.
IT'S CALLED EXPENSING.
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST THINGS IN THE BILL.
I THINK PEOPLE WILL GO OUT AND 
GO WILD OVER EXPENSING.
BOB CRAFT MENTIONED THAT LAST 
NIGHT IN HIS TELEPHONE CALL.
THE FACT THEY CAN EXPENSE TO ONE
YEAR EXPENSING IS AN ASSET.
HISTORIC SMALL BUSINESS TAX CUTS
ARE MADE REALLY, REALLY GOOD FOR
THE BUSINESS OWNER.
THEY'RE HIRING PEOPLE.
I SEE IT ON TELEVISION.
I'M READING ABOUT IT ALL OVER.
THE SMALL BUSINESS TAX CUT ARE 
NOW REALLY IN CONCERNTY VIEZING 
PEOPLE.
WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK 
PROBABLY $4 TRILLION FROM 
OVERSEAS.
NOBODY KNOWS THE EXACT NUMBER.
IT'S MASSIVE.
IT WILL BE OVER 3 TRILLION.
IT COULD BE 5 TRILLION.
IT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 
MONEY THAT THE BUREAUCRACY PLUS 
TAX LAWS DIDN'T ALLOW IT TO BE 
BROUGHT BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY.
WE THINK AT LEAST $4 TRILLION 
WILL BE BROUGHT BACK AND IF YOU 
LOOK AT THAT, IT'S GOING TO BE 
BROUGHT BACK RIGHT UNDER THE 
CODE.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
REPUBLICANS WANTED FOR YEARS AND
DEMOCRATS WANTED FOR YEARS.
YET IT NEVER GOT DONE.
WHO WOULD OBJECT TO TRILLIONS OF
DOLLARS BEING BROUGHT BACK INTO 
OUR COUNTRY?
NOBODY.
IT NEVER GOT DOWN.
NOW IT IS.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS THE 
BIGGEST TAX CUTS AND REFORM IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
THIS IS BIGGER THAN ACTUALLY 
PRESIDENT REAGAN'S MANY YEARS 
AGO.
I'M HONORED BY IT.
IN ADDITION WE HAVE ANWAR.
WE'RE OPENING THAT UP FOR 
DRILLING.
THEY'VE TRIED TO GET THAT FOR 40
YEARS.
THEY TRIED TO GET IT DURING THE 
REAGAN ADMINISTRATION.
THAT WOULD BE A BIG BILL IF THAT
HAPPENED.
THAT'S PART OF THIS.
WE HAVE OF COURSE THE INDIVIDUAL
MANDATE WHICH IS A VERY UNFAIR 
AND VERY UNPOPULAR PROVISION AS 
YOU KNOW IN OBAMACARE.
ESSENTIALLY I THINK IT 
ULTIMATELY LEADS TO THE END OF 
OBAMACARE.
I THINK OBAMACARE IS OVER 
BECAUSE OF THAT.
WE'RE GOING TO COME UP WITH 
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY GOING TO
BE VERY GOOD.
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WAS VERY 
UNFAIR.
YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING PAY FOR 
SOMETHING IN ORDER TO NOT TO 
HAVE TO GET HEALTH CARE.
YOU'RE PAYING NOT TO HAVE TO 
HAVE HEALTH CARE.
IT WAS VERY UNFAIR.
MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT IT SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN OVERTURNED IN THE 
SUPREME COURT.
DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT.
ALMOST.
NOW WE'RE OVERTURNED THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.
THE MOST UNPOPULAR THING IN 
OBAMACARE.
VERY, VERY UNFAIR.
THIS IS THE BILL RIGHT HERE.
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IT.
IT'S GOING TO BE A FLEN DOUSE 
THIN
TREMENDOUS THING FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
IT'S GOING TO BE FABULOUS FOR 
THE ECONOMY.
IT'S GOING TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM 
LEAVING OUR SHORES AND OPENING 
UP IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SENSE TO DO
THAT.
YOU DO THAT AND I DON'T THINK 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING YOUR 
COMPANY VERY WELL.
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE'RE 
GOING TO SIGN THIS.
THIS IS A LITTLE PICTURE OF IT.
IT FITS NICELY IN THE BOX.
I SAID TAKE IT OUT OF BOX 
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE TO SEE.
ALL OF THIS -- EVERYTHING IN 
HERE IS REALLY TREMENDOUS THINGS
FOR BUSINESSES, FOR PEOPLE, FOR 
THE MIDDLE CLASS, FOR WORKERS.
I CONSIDER THIS VERY MUCH A BILL
FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND A BILL 
FOR JOBS.
JOBS ARE PRODUCED THROUGH 
COMPANIES AND CORPORATIONS.
YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING.
CORPORATIONS ARE LITERALLY GOING
WILD OVER THIS.
I THINK EVEN BEYOND MY 
EXPECTATIONS, SO FAR BEYOND MY 
EXPECTATIONS.
I'LL SIGN THIS TODAY RATHER THAN
HAVING A BIG FORMAL CEREMONY IN 
TWO WEEKS WHEN WE WERE GOING TO 
DO IT.
I DIDN'T WANT YOU FOLKS TO SAY I
WASN'T KEEPING MY PROMISE.
I'M KEEPING MY PROMISE AND 
SIGNING IT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
I SAID THE BILL WOULD BE ON MY 
DESK BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
YOU ARE HOLDING ME LITERALLY TO 
THAT.
WE DID A RUSH JOB TODAY.
IT'S NOT FANCY.
BUT IT'S THE OVAL OFFICE.
IT'S THE GREAT OVAL OFFICE.
JUST TO CONCLUDE OUR COUNTRY IS 
DOING VERY WELL.
WE TREMENDOUSLY CUT REGULATIONS.
LEGISLATIVE APPROVALS FOR WHICH 
I'M GIVEN NO CREDIT IN THE 
MAINSTREAM MEDIA WE BELIEVE I 
HAVE 88 WHICH IS NUMBER ONE.
SECOND NOW IS HARRY TRUMAN, A 
RECORD LONG HELD.
WE BEAT HIM ON LEGISLATIVE 
APPROVALS FOR WHICH I GET NO 
CREDIT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY HE NEEDED 
THIS BECAUSE HE'S HAD NO 
LEGISLATIVE APPROVALS.
IF YOU LOOK AT VA ACCOUNTABILITY
ACT AND SO MANY OTHER BILLS 
HAVING TO DO WITH THE VA, HAVING
TO DO WITH MILITARY AND MANY 
THINGS, WE HAVE MORE LEGISLATIVE
VICTORIES THAN ANY OTHER 
PRESIDENT, NOT INCLUDING THIS.
THIS IS THE CAPPER.
THIS IS AGAIN, THE BIGGEST TAX 
CUT, BIGGEST REFORM OF ALL TIME.
IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU WITH 
US AND WE WILL SIGN THIS RIGHT 
NOW.
THIS IS SOMETHING I'M VERY PROUD
OF, GREAT FOR OUR COUNTRY.
GREAT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
THANK YOU ALL.
SO WE WON'T DO THE WHOLE THING.
THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT IT IS.
THAT'S YOUR BILL.
AND I WANT TO THANK SOME PEOPLE 
IN PARTICULAR THAT AREN'T HERE 
BECAUSE AGAIN WE EXPECTED A 
FORMAL CEREMONY IN TWO WEEKS.
MITCH McCONNELL HAS BEEN 
FANTASTIC.
WORKED SO HARD.
WE WOULD SPEAK AT 3:00 IN THE 
MORNING AND 2:00 IN THE MORNING 
AND WE WOULD SPEAK WHENEVER WE 
HAD TO SIPEAK.
THE EXACT SAME THING CAN BE SAID
OF PAUL RYAN.
THEY ARE VERY PROUD OF THIS.
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE 
RESULTS.
AS I SAID LONG AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE.
PAUL RYAN, MITCH McCONNELL THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.
ORRIN HATCH THE CHAIRMAN MADE A 
BEAUTIFUL SPEECH THE OTHER DAY 
IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, 
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT, BEAUTIFUL 
SPEECH.
WE APPRECIATED IT.
KEVIN BRADY I DON'T THINK HE 
SLEPT.
MIKE ENZI, DIANE BLACK, ROB 
PORTMAN.
ROB WORKED SO HARD.
SO KNOWLEDGEABLE ON THE SUBJECT.
PAT TOOMEY, JOHN, THESE PEOPLE 
WORKED SO HARD.
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GIVEN 
THE PROPER CREDIT.
THE WHOLE SENATE, UNFORTUNATELY 
THE REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE.
DEMOCRATS DON'T LIKE TAX CUTS.
THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES.
THEY DON'T WANT TO LOWER YOUR 
TAXES.
THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES 
AND SPEND MONEY FOOLISHLY ON 
THINGS WE DON'T NEED IN MANY 
CASES.
SO WE'RE CUTTING TAXES.
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR 
MILITARY AND TAKING CARE OF 
PEOPLE.
WE'RE REALLY DOING A JOB ON 
JOBS.
THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN SO 
FANTASTIC THAT I HAD TO CALL 
THEM OUT.
PLENTY OF OTHERS.
REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE AND 
REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE HAVE 
BEEN INCREDIBLE.
THIS IS WHAT WE GOT.
WE HAD IT.
IT WAS ALL SET TO GO.
AS SOON AS I GOT BACK FROM 
CHRISTMAS WE'LL BE WORKING IN 
FLORIDA.
I'LL BE WORKING DURING HARD 
DURING CHRISTMAS.
WE HAVE MANY THINGS WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT INCLUDING NORTH 
KOREA, INCLUDING A LOT OF THINGS
HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS 
YOU KNOW.
WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN
SYRIA WITH ISIS.
WE'VE TAKEN BACK VIRTUALLY ALL 
OF THE LAND.
SAME THING IN IRAQ.
WE'RE MAKING TREMENDOUS STRIDES.
IT'S THE UNWRITTEN STORY RIGHT 
NOW.
SINCE MIP SPEECH ON AFGHANISTAN 
WE'RE MAKING TREMENDOUS STRIDES.
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD IN 
AFGHANISTAN.
I'LL BE WORKING VERY HARD OVER 
THE HOLIDAYS.
I WANT TO WISH YOU A VERY MERRY 
CHRISTMAS.
I HAVE SOME BEAUTIFUL PENS OVER 
HERE.
BECAUSE ALL THESE FOLKS ARE 
EITHER CONTINUING TO WORK DOWN 
THE ROAD OR GETTING READY TO 
LEAVE AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE 
WORKING VERY HARD ALSO, I THINK 
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO HANDSOME 
OF THEM TO THE PRESS.
WOULD ANY OF THE MEDIA LIKE -- 
LOOK AT THESE CAMERA GUYS.
I THINK WE'LL DO THAT.
WE HAVE THEM.
MANY OF YOU HAVE WORKED VERY 
HARD AND MANY OF YOU HAVE WORKED
VERY, VERY FAIRLY.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
>> Reporter: MR. PRESIDENT, CAN 
YOU TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU'LL 
TRAVEL TO SELL THIS?
>> I DON'T THINK I'LL HAVE TO 
TRAVEL TOO MUCH TO SELL IT.
IT'S SELLING ITSELF.
YOU'LL SEE ON FEBRUARY 1st WHEN 
THEY OPEN THE PAYCHECK.
THAT'S WHEN YOU SEE IT.
BY SIGNING IT NOW IT KICKS IN.
IF WE DIDN'T MAKE A CERTAIN DATE
IT WOULDN'T KICK IN UNTIL THE 
FOE LOWING YEAR 2019.
I WASN'T HAPPY WITH THAT.
EVEN LANGUAGE SAID THE CORPORATE
WOULD KICK IN IN' 19.
WE DIDN'T DO THAT.
I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE TO DO 
MUCH SELLING.
I THINK THE CORPORATIONS GIVING 
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AWAY TO 
THEIR WORKERS AND MANY MORE ARE 
COMING I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S 
SELLING THIS BETTER THAN I 
COULD.
I THINK COME FEBRUARY WHEN THEY 
OPEN THEIR CHECKS AND SEE I HAVE
A LOT MORE MONEY IN HERE THAT'S 
GOING TO BE SOMETHING VERY 
SPECIAL.
HAVE A GREAT HOLIDAY.
SOME OF YOU FOLKS TAKE -- IN 
PARTICULAR I LIKE THE BOOM 
HOLDERS.
THEY WERE SO NICE TO ME THE 
OTHER DAY AND THE CAMERA DAY. 
>> THANKS EVERYONE.
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS WILL 
REALLY REGRET -- THE DEMOCRATS 
ALREADY REGRET IT.
THEY HAVE THEIR TYPICAL THING 
IT'S FOR THE RICH.
THEY KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE.
THEY'VE BEEN CALLED OUT ON IT BY
THE MEDIA.
THEY WANTED TO BE A PART OF IT.
IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.
I REALLY BELIEVE -- I SAID ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA I BELIEVE WE'LL 
HAVE A LOTS OF BIPARTISAN WORK 
DONE.
MAYBE WE START WITH 
INFRASTRUCTURE.
I BELIEVE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE 
BIPARTISAN.
WE'VE SPENT $7 TRILLION IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST NOT TO MENTION ALL 
THE LIVES AND HEART ACHE.
IT'S SO SAD.
$7 TRILLION.
IT'S TIME TO REBUILD OUR 
COUNTRY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 
>> EVERYONE IT'S TIME TO GO.
>> Reporter: DO YOU THINK IF YOU
WOULD HAVE STARTED WITH 
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN HAD THINGS DONE 
DIFFERENTLY?
>> WE'RE GOING TO START ON 
INFRASTRUCTURE.
WE ESSENTIALLY REPEALED 
OBAMACARE.
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS A BIG 
DEAL.
INFRASTRUCTURE IS BY FAR THE 
EASIEST.
PEOPLE WANT IT, REPUBLICANS AND 
DEMOCRATS.
WE'LL HAVE TREMENDOUS DEMOCRAT 
SUPPORT ON INFRASTRUCTURE.
I COULD HAVE STARTED WITH 
INFRASTRUCTURE.
I ACTUALLY WANTED TO SAVE THE 
EASY ONE FOR THE ONE DOWN THE 
ROAD.
WE'LL BE HAVING THAT DONE PRETTY
QUICKLY.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Reporter: IS THERE ANYTHING 
IN THIS PROCESS YOU LEARNED?
>> I THINK I REALLY HAVE.
I GOT TO KNOW AND BECAME 
FRIENDLY WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE 
HOUSE, PEOPLE IN THE SENATE, 
BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.
WHEN I CAME I DIDN'T KNOW TOO 
MANY.
I WAS POLITICALLY ACTIVE, BUT I 
DIDN'T KNOW TOO MANY.
I THINK THE FACT I'VE BECOME 
FRIENDS WITH SOME MANY OF THE 
NAMES I READ AND SO MANY 
REPUBLICANS.
I CAN 
I CAN CALL ANY OF THEM.
I UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS WELL.
IT'S BEEN A GREAT PROCESS.
I DO BELIEVE THAT THE FACT THAT 
I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW SO MANY OF
THESE PEOPLE -- MANY OF THESE 
PEOPLE I HAVE TO SAY, NOT ALL, 
MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE GREAT 
PEOPLE THAT TRULY LOVE THIS 
COUNTRY.
I THINK THAT HELPS.
I THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THIS 
LEGISLATION.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> WE'VE BEEN WATCHING MAYBE ONE
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENTS SO
FAR IN THIS PRESIDENCY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNING THAT TAX
BILL, THE $1.5 TRILLION TAX 
OVERHAUL.
A COMPLETE REWRITE OF OUR 
SYSTEM.
A LAW THAT WILL NOW LIKELY 
AFFECT EVERY SINGLE TAX PAYER 
ACROSS AMERICA.
THIS WAS MOMENTS AGO INSIDE THE 
OVAL OFFICE.
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOKE UP 
THIS MORNING AND WATCHED THE 
NEWS AND HE WAS WONDERING IF HE 
WAS GOING TO SIGN THIS BILL 
BEFORE CHRISTMAS AS HE PROMISED.
HE SAID REPORTERS WERE ASKING 
THE QUESTION.
HE SAID HE DECIDED TO DO IT AT 
THE LAST MINUTE.
HE SPOKE FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES 
TOUTING HOW GREAT THE BILL WAS 
HOW IT WAS GOING TO CUT TAXES.
DEMOCRATS POINTING OUT IT WILL 
CUT TAXES FOR WEALTHY AND BIG 
BUSINESS.
THE PRESIDENT IN A GIVING SPIRIT
GIVING PENS OUT TO HIS FRIENDS 
IN THE MEDIA WHO HE'S HAD CHOICE
WORDS OUT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
HE SAID THE BILL IS POPULAR.
I WANT TO BRING IN MARY BRUCE.
MARY, YOU'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS.
RIGHT NOW THIS BILL THAT IS THE 
LAW, IT HAS BEEN POPULAR WITH
AMERICANS SO FAR. 
>> THIS BILL IS DEEPLY 
UNPOPULAR.
REPUBLICANS INSIST IT WILL BE 
ONCE AMERICANS START TO FEEL THE
IMPACTS OF THE BILL IN THEIR 
WALLET.
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT INSIST 
THEY WON'T HAVE TO SELL THIS 
BILL.
THERE'S NO QUESTION REPUBLICANS 
HAVE A LONG ROAD TO GO AS THEY 
TRY TO TERRAIN THIS LEGISLATIVE 
WIN INTO A POLITICAL WIN 
ESPECIALLY HEADING INTO 
MIDTERMS.
THE BILL IS PREDICTED TO ADD 
QUITE A LOT 0 THE DEFICIT.
AS YOU MENTIONED EXPERTS CAUTION
WHILE THE REPUBLICANS INSIST THE
BENEFITS GO TO THE MIDDLE CLASS 
IT APPEARS FROM ANALYSIS THE 
ULTRA RICH MAY BENEFIT MOST.
REPUBLICANS I TALKED WITH KNOW 
THEY HAVE TO SELL THIS PLAN.
THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE AMERICANS
AS THEY START TO SEE SOME 
CHANGES THAT THAT ATTRIBUTE THAT
TO REPUBLICANS AS THEY TRY TO 
GET A LEGISLATIVE WIN HERE.
SOME AMERICANS COULD BEGIN TO 
SEE MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS 
STARTING IN FEBRUARY WHEN LESS 
MONEY IS WITHHELD FROM THEIR 
PAYCHECKS.
MOST IMPACTS WON'T BE FELT UNTIL
YOU FILE YOUR 2018 TAX RETURNS. 
>> HE WANTED TO BUILD BRIDGES 
WITH MITCH McCONNELL AND SPEAKER
PAUL RYAN.
HE'S HAD A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP 
WITH MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY.
IT WAS ROUGH AT THE BEGINNING OF
HIS PRESIDENCY WHEN HE WAS 
TRYING TO PASS HEALTH CARE 
REFORM.
CLEARLY THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE 
VICTORY FOR REPUBLICANS AND THE 
PRESIDENT.
THIS WILL BECOME AN ISSUE AND 
SOMETHING THEY WANT TO CAMPAIGN 
ONGOING INTO THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS. 
>> ABSOLUTELY.
ROCKY TO SAY THE LEAST.
THE RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN FRAUT 
OVER THE FIRST MONTHS OF THE 
PRESIDENCY.
THE LAST FEW DAYS THERE WAS 
QUITE A BACK SLAPPING VICTORY 
LAP.
THIS IS A HUGE LEGISLATIVE 
ACCOMP
ACCOMPLISHMENT.
NOT JUST FOR THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION BUT THE 
LEGISLATIVE LEADERS.
THEY'RE TRYING TO SHOW THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE THIS BILL WILL 
BE GOOD FOR THEM.
MOST AMERICANS WILL GET A TAX 
CUT AT FIRST.
THAT'S THE MESSAGE YOU'LL HEAR 
REPUBLICANS HAMMERING HERE IN 
WASHINGTON AND ON THE CAMPAIGN 
TRIAL. 
>> A MAJOR DAY AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND A MAJOR DAY FOR ALL OF
AMERICA.
MARY BRUCE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE'LL BE FOLLOWING THE STORY ALL
DAY ON ABCNEWS.COM.
WE'LL BREAK DOWN THE TAX PLAN 
HOW IT AFFECTS ALL AMERICANS, 
THE DIFFERENT ECONOMIC CLASSES 
AND THE POLITICAL FALL OUT AND 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT STANDS TO 
GAIN WITH THIS TAX PLAN.
WE WANT TO RETURN TO OUR REGULAR
PROGRAMMING.
VIEWERS ON THE WEST COAST IS 
"GOOD MORNING AMERICA."
WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
WATCHING.

SPECIAL REPORT FROM
