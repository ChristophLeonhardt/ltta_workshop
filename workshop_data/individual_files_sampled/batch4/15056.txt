yes Sharia has regulations about women dress and conduct to make sure that their behavior and their address is according to Sharia so whatever seductive appearance makeup anything that attracts male toward the female family member that irritates that gay read that sense of jealousy that the Muslim men have over or about their female family members so if the female family member crosses the boundary or violates that Sharia regulations so that the Muslim male might try to harm them or try to prevent them by force so the word in arabic is guerra now does that apply to both the strange man who might be walking by and seeing his daughter a wife or does it only apply to the daughter or wife herself that does the obligation on a muslim man under this interpretation of Sharia does any of the responsibilities fall on the man or is it all just the woman who is dishonorable by even showing herself to a man I'm just curious what Sharia says so Sharia objects all Muslim men in the community to stop women from becoming - from violating Sharia so even a stranger it's not Muslim men might see another woman who was appearance as non Islamic or against Sharia even a stranger Muslim male can go on a stop him even by force so that's that's called enjoining good and forbidden evil so whatever non-islamic thing must be a stop even by force based on that principle this gara thing normally applies to female family members or main family members go against their female family members if they violate Sharia law but it doesn't mean that other Muslims cannot do it if the family members do not enjoin that other members of the community can take action and do it what I was actually asking about I mean your answer is very interesting as well but let's say in the case of the Shaffir family in Ontario a few years back if my recollection serves one of the women wanted to have a boyfriend which is a Canadian thing to do but I guess not a sufficiently Islamic thing to do for the Afghan family of the sophia's in the end the the shafy has murdered their three daughters from one of the wives is any of the violence any of the punishment would that be directed as the boyfriend as well or is it just a female crime you know dating is specifically with non-muslims is severely punished when it comes to Sharia law Sharia provides that Muslim women cannot marry non-muslim men and specifically if they are not if the Muslim woman is not in wedlock which somebody is has not married somebody has to stop dating or should not go through that inappropriate contact with a stranger or with a man who is not a real relative now how about the man itself so and again I'm just not that it's that anything turns on it but I'm just trying to learn a little bit more about this Islamic sharia concept of gara of this covetous jealous honor that men watch over women so let's say in the case of the Shafie is there was some local boy let's call him you know John Smith or something would the Sofya patriarch would the father of the family would he do violence against John Smith also or would he only do violence against his own daughter they normally put the blame on their own female family members but it doesn't mean that they do not actually take action against the stranger men but normally they focus on their own female family members right that they say if if you had behaved based on Sharia we wouldn't have run into such a problem so they put the problem on the woman in this case yeah I've heard an analogy I hear this a lot I mean in Australia the leading Imam said to women it's like you're uncovered meat you don't blame the cat for eating uncovered meat an analogy I hear a lot in Canada is it's like a lollipop without a wrapper every bug gets stuck to it you have a wrapper around a lollipop you don't blame the Flies so it's I mean I've literally heard Imams around the world use those analogies which which basically says - it's another way of saying you were asking for it the blame is on you I find that very depressing hey let me ask you a question this case in in gatineau it's still yet to be proven in court but the the facts as the police allege are quite shocking my theory is for every case we hear about there's an enormous number of cases we don't hear about because the women don't know they have rights or are afraid to reach out to have rights in some cases women don't even know that it's that they're free because they're so kept under the authority of of the men in their lives they don't know what freedom in Canada or America means what's your take on that you've studied this you've written the book on honor killing what do you think of my theory I think that that's true but even if they know that the host country gives them that freedom they are afraid that they're their male family members do not care and come after them anyway and you know Maher probably that the most American the cost for going to jail or whatever so the Muslim woman knows that they know if they behave inappropriately against Sharia the Muslim male is gonna come after them no matter what so they are afraid at the same time some of them become like battered woman syndrome they get to that sense that they are abused but they just follow and they just go through that and suffer from inside they put the headscarf by force you know but they normally do not try to go against their family because they know the punishment and the consequence is gone so severe you know it's a very good point we used to hear the phrase battered windrow battered women's syndrome a lot in the West talking about how women can be psychologically broken it's a form of Stockholm Syndrome you sure don't hear that a lot when we're talking about forcibly women wearing niqab Xand saying no I really like this I really like wearing a big black smoke when it's 35 degrees celcius out I really like not showing my face we should start to use the word battered women's syndrome because that's exactly what's going on Daniel Akbari it's a pleasure to talk with you your actual Sharia trained lawyer the book for those who want to order it on Amazon I'm looking at the Amazon sheet right here it's called honor killing a professionals guide to sexual relations and gara violence from the Islamic sources and Guerra is the Arabic word for jealousy Daniel Akbari thanks as always for a very educational interview that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
