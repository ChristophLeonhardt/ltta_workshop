the chance of his of him winning is greater than a lot of liberals and Hillary voters think that it is I don't trust these polls I think the Trump vote is under counted and people need to take him and his campaign very seriously it's an unorthodox campaign it's it's one that where he has put on the ballot beside his name a chance for us to have a referendum on things like sexism misogyny racism narcissism all of that is right there embodied in the name of Donald J Trump so I'm looking forward to being able to go and vote down all of those things on Tuesday everybody needs to take this very seriously because I don't want people waking up the day after the election learn how did this happen well it happened because you forgot to vote
