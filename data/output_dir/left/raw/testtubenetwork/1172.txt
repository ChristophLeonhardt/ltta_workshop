00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,290
Since the fall of the Berlin Wall 25 years
ago, Germany has established itself as

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,350
Europe’s largest economy. But their economy
is also starting to show some signs of

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,110
decline, and there are fears that this could
lead to a recession. So what impact is this

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,699
dip having on Germany? And how powerful is
the country overall?

5
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,150
Well, the short answer is they are very powerful,
with some potentially growing

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,730
weaknesses. For one thing, German may have
to cut back on their military. They

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,949
currently have the world’s 7th strongest
military force, employing 183,000 active

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,380
troops. That’s behind other European countries
like France and the UK, and quite a

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,130
ways behind the USA and China, but it’s
still a sizable amount. They’re also at

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:41,410
the

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,050
forefront of developing military technology.
The problem is that maintaining this military

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,219
and developing new technology is an expensive
endeavor that Germany may not

13
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,360
be able to afford. According to a recent leaked
report, “Only one of [Germany’s] four

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,789
submarines is operational” and “just seven
of the German Navy’s fleet of 43 helicopters

15
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:00,489
are flightworthy.”

16
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:04,869
They’ve also had problems with broken down
aircrafts. This recently stopped troops

17
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:09,179
from returning home from Afghanistan and hindered
the nation’s effort to join the fight

18
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:14,350
against both ISIS and Ebola. German defense
minister Ursula von der Leyen has admitted

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,899
that the country’s military is facing equipment
shortages so severe

20
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:22,319
that it cannot meet its NATO commitments,
which could be a serious blow to their status

21
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,209
in Europe.

22
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:28,079
So, why is the largest economy in the EU unable
to afford something as simple as

23
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,409
vehicle repairs?

24
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,419
Well, their economic growth has slowed for
a number of reasons. They have

25
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:37,289
Europe’s most ambitious renewable energy
plan, which has yet to offer any clear

26
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:42,249
financial returns. They’ve also had slower
export growth in China than expected, and

27
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:46,909
are unable to continue their normal trade
with Russia because of sanctions. Germany

28
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:46,979
is

29
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,310
reportedly losing over $100 million euros
this year alone, due to a now-canceled arms

30
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,999
deal with Russia.

31
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:57,659
Despite all of that, Germany’s economy is
still strong and they have enormous

32
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,649
political power. They’re a founding member
of the EU, a contributing member of NATO,

33
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:07,329
and they’re extremely active in the United
Nations. So, even if Germany were to find

34
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:11,849
itself in a recession, it would still maintain
its political place as the leading power in

35
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,670
Europe. It would just have to tighten its
belt a bit, to stay there financially.
