it's always easy to wonder whether or not physics is almost near the end have we found absolutely everything that there is defined and it's you know a historically unlikely thing if you're gonna say that then you're going to be right many many people have said that not that we understand everything but then a few years we'll have it all figured out the eyes will be dogged the t's will be crossed they have never been correct we do understand an enormous amount of current physics we understand all the particles and forces that you and I are made up so people were worried that once we found that haze that's the last part of what we call the standard model of particle physics maybe there's wasn't anything next to be found within our lifetimes and that they may still be right but there's plenty of evidence that they're not there are ideas like supersymmetry and string theory it may or may not be accessible at accelerators but there's also data like the existence of dark matter in the universe that convinces us that the particles and forces that we know about are not the whole story
