maybe you have heard about the new trend in terrible parenting it's called babies this is the label that certain white upper-class liberal parents have given to their to their children who they want to raise gender-neutral they want gender-neutral children without gender labels they said down with labels no more labels and then they proceeded to invent a new label which is they nice so no we don't we don't want any labels whatsoever except for these over here that we've just invented off the top of our head there's an NBC article about this trend and it's gotten some attention it focuses especially on the stories of Nate and Julia sharp who are well actually let me just I'll read a little bit from this article just to cut just you understand what we're dealing with here and to kind of set the stage a little bit let me read from this article in NBC it says three-year-old twins xyler and Caden scurried around the boy and girls clothing racks of a narrow consignment store filled with toys xyler wearing rainbow leggings scrutinized a pair of hot pink and purple sneakers Zaidan in a t-rex shirt fixated on a musical cube that flashed colourful lights at a glance the only discernible difference between these fraternal twins is their hair sylars is brown and Cadence's blonde is Zeiler a boy or a girl how about Kayden that's a question their parents Nate and Julia Sharpe say only the twins can decide the couple from Cambridge Massachusetts of course represent a small group of parents raising babies children being brought up without gender designation from birth Nate Nate sharp told NBC News a baby is I think different things to different people for us it means raising our kids with with with gender-neutral pronouns so they then their rather than assigning he/she him/her from birth based on their Anatomy let's pause right there for just a moment okay I don't mean to interrupt mr. Nate sharp but they they're them those are pronouns that you have assigned so you're saying well we're not going to assign he or she so instead we're going to assign assigned a in them you still assigned pronouns you nitwit it's exactly what you're doing you just assigned different pronouns and actually he and she are not assigned by anyone any more than your biological sex is assigned this whole idea of assigning to sex what do you mean a site where is sex where is that happening it's okay it's not like you've got a bunch of ambiguous neutral babies being born and then they're all laying out a nursery then you've got doctors that come by and go we're gonna sign him boy make that one a girl I would have to do two girls over there we'll do that one a boy tonight you know actually not well let's make that one a girl that one a boy and all right so then we got to girl that's not what's happening that is not there's no there's no sex assignment Ward in in the birthing center of the hospital that doesn't see what happens is you've got boys and girls who are born and then the doctors will look at them and say oh that's a boy or oh that's a girl and then linguistically there are certain pronouns that come attached to that naturally as part of our language it's not a sign what you're doing here Nate sharp is you are actually assigning artificially a pronoun that that would not otherwise that that is not natural to the to the child
