kerryevelyn Harris joins us now she's running for a Senate in Delaware and she's running yes Democratic incumbent Tom Carper carried great to have you all on rebel headquarters thank you for having me on Jake I really do appreciate it all right no great to have you so I want to talk about your background a little bit you've worked at a lot of different odd jobs that's interesting yeah and but first I want to talk about Tom Carper and so you're a Democrat you've got just Democrats supporting your working families party supporting you a lot of progressive supporting you but why take on Tom Carper I'm taking our Tom Carper for a number of reasons you know it's easy on this the surface if you don't get into the define he wants us to think that Tom Carper isn't a threat to the average Delaware e'en eight about 80 to 85 percent of the time he votes on Democratic lines but the problem comes in when he fails to stand and set a clear line for what is right for our people he was giving the opportunity to vote to vote for pharmaceuticals to come in from Canada when we know they're tested to the same standard and we have a rising number of seniors in our state because many people choose to retire here we also have a large percentage of people living in poverty in the state of Delaware and they require prescriptions they can afford and he voted no the Keystone pipeline there are people here in Delaware pride themselves on being environmentalists because we are the lowest lying state in the Union we understand that climate change is a real issue that we have to be concerned with and while the Keystone pipeline may seem far removed from us we do know the impact that an oil spill will have and we don't want to see that happening to anyone and when he voted YES on that Keystone pipeline it was truly an affront to the people here of Delaware we go further with his financial deregulation I was standing on the side of banks is a problem we will use the excuse that we were that industry heavily here in our state however we would still be the home of banks because we offer such a wonderful tax shelter that even if we became stronger on our taxes required more and put regulations in place we would still be the best option in the entire United States for banking industries so there is no excuse not to hold them to a standard and also with the safar masu tackles we never put regulations in place and so the costs keep flying and out of control and it's something we just cannot handle you know list goes on and on but the truth is we needed somebody to stand up and stand up for the people at all times not just when it was convenient or the collapse you know what was the popular issue at the time but because it was the right thing all along and you need somebody at the forefront not afraid to make that loud noise and saying we will speak for the people at all times if they can give us a dollar or a thousand dollars or a million dollars it doesn't matter it's there it's them that individual that counts and not the corporations gee I wonder if the financial company is donating a Tom Carper had anything to do with his decision to deregulate them while using Delaware as an excuse I want to keep giving your website throughout the interview because I think it's so important that you win so it's kerryevelyn harris calm and let me tell you something especially in Delaware if you volunteer you will make all the difference this is a race that is incredibly similar to Alexandria cross your Cortes because it does not take that many votes to win in Delaware it's a tiny state and you could actually contact all of them and you can make the difference in having a progressive Democrat win as opposed to having these corporate Democrats that continually vote against our interest so kerryevelyn harris calm and we'll put the links down below if you're watching this later on YouTube or Facebook but I'm not done with Tom Carper yet so how about the fact that we've got Brent Cavanaugh up for a Supreme Court seat now I mean a Democrat from a blue state like Delaware I mean he never voted for Cavanaugh did he when a foreign the only one left in Congress we have to wonder what's going on there and it's interesting he gives the excuse that if he would have known then what he knows now he wouldn't have voted for him and yet every other Democrat except for four got it right and yet every other Democrat that heard the same evidence he heard understood that there was a problem with this man being appointed so the question is what piece of the evidence did you miss and why are you still the only one in Senate knowing that you made such a drastic mistake and now it's an excuse used by the Republicans to say oh he's moderate look we had four Democrats vote for him in the past he again needs someone that notices things before it's actually a problem yeah his best case scenario is don't worry people of Deltora vote for me I have really bad judgment not bad intent okay oh that's a curious decision by the way if you're wondering he was up for a US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and that's when Carper voted in favor of him but he it was already massively pro-corporate judge at that point he'd already worked for the Bush administration and he was a political hatchet man for Republicans at that point and Carper voted for him anyway and they call that bipartisanship I call that screwing over the American people to help the people in power so kerryevelyn Harris calm this is again a unique especially for a Senate race a unique Senate race where you can absolutely make a difference Tom Carper takes corporate money and serve corporate interests Kerry doesn't take any corporate PAC money she's a just Democrat she's gonna serve your interests so Kerry let's talk about your background before I get to your policies which I love the sign in the background I want to talk about that in a second to denying health care is violence it is that like nobody in it yeah I'm jumping into it now we'll get back to your background but I mean you know I remember when Alan Grayson said that the Republican health care plans would lead to you dying but in the case of health care isn't that literal yes yes it's true and there is no excuse with such a wealthy and powerful nation that we are still having to argue whether it is a human right to have health care and you can get into the semantics of it you can say well what about the finances well the truth is it's not only morally correct it's financially sound and the only people that benefit from continuing to not have a universal health care system are those who run health insurance companies and again where are our elected officials getting their money from insurance companies and so when we're asking them to write legislation that could injure their their war chest for an election we wonder why they're not concerned about whether we're living or dying at the end and they give all the excuses and they'll say well we're gonna offer access to health care access is not okay we all technically already have access to health care we need free health care for everyone that is equal across across the board so that we don't have to worry what tomorrow looks like we don't have to worry if our kids are going to be healthy we don't have to worry if our parents knee hurts if they're going to be able to afford a replacement we don't have to worry if our health is going to be enough so that we can make it to work and pay our bills and contribute to our society there is no excuse that is valid to not have a universal health care system that is free to everyone and you know when when senators like Tom Carper reinforced Republican talking points it drives me crazy so when Feinstein says that Medicare for all is a takeover the whole health care system that is not true that's what Republicans say when Carper says oh well you have access to health care but that's what Republicans say oh you have access to an emergency room problem solved no problem is not solved we have a terrible system we weigh overpay and we don't get results and 15% of Americans actually are uninsured and then even groups like Associated Press and they do good journalism most of the time but yesterday they write an article about how well it would increase cause first of all it's not true it would decrease costs they forgot to leave out how much the system cost that caused now but second of all they say well since we would assure more people we'd I guess have to pay for them or what carry or do we just leave that 15% in the streets that die exactly exactly and you know it's funny because those same pundits and asked Ocasio and I are both justice Democrats and you know they're gonna try to pick us apart for not getting everything perfect and I know that recently she was picked that for not they said that she doesn't understand a ten-year budget which ironically those same groups of people are saying while it's going to cost more for health care but apparently they don't understand a ten-year budget because over time we're gonna save two trillion dollars with the Medicare for all healthcare program but they don't want to mention that just as you said and so before we start to question whether those of us who have the heart of the people at hand immediately as our charge we should want to ask them are you really paying attention to the facts before you ask us do we understand a ten-year budget what I do understand is that when I knock on doors people are worried about what tomorrow looks like they're coughing and you say have you gone to the doctor's no I can't afford it personally my my copay jumped from and I have a pretty low one from $12 for a specialist to $60 so I immediately had to decide whether my child should be able to go to see his allergist because I am technically a low income wage earner and so $60 makes me really consider and get my son my son has a lot of gastric issues because of his allergies and I literally had to put off bringing him to the doctors because of these hikes and premiums that people seem like it doesn't doesn't make a difference well to the working-class family it makes a difference and I shouldn't have to make the decision on when my child goes to the doctor and risk his health but that is real and so when I'm running I'm not running because I'm knocking on doors and I feel bad for someone else yes I carry that story with me but at the same time this is incredibly personal it is affecting me and my family right now and if it's happening to me and I'm somebody that is outspoken and I deal in the political system all the time what about those that who don't even realize they have a voice yet yeah so it wouldn't be amazing to have a senator who actually worries about a sixty dollar copay senators Harper probably is amused by the idea of a sixty dollar copay but look I we're really really out of time I know that you're for Medicare for all in $15 minimum wage and criminal justice reform and getting money out of politics and and I want everybody know that but one last super quick question because I did mention it earlier you've had a lot of different jobs from construction to cutting grass so work in an auto body shop and you're a veteran you were in the Air Force so why did you get into politics why'd you decide to do this Senate run new thing to me I was I was raised and my parents were organizers and then even as they were teachers they made sure that we participated in our system and helped out our communities and so whenever I could even when I was in the military even as an auto body mechanic even when I was cutting grass and and frying chicken at a local gas station I made sure I participated in the system pushed policy I made sure that I organized my community and pushed forward I think it's very important that we are active in our democracy and whenever we become complacent we get into situations like we are now I mean now I'm just taking it to the next step it was never my intention to run but once I realized that there had to be a change and nobody was willing to step up and do make that change I knew I had to be that one I always say words without action I mute and I couldn't be a hypocrite I had to stand up and take the charge that was put before me all right well all you watching right now it's your turn you got to take action right now kerryevelyn harris comm so if you can volunteer that is the best thing you could do this is a very winnable race have someone that actually represents you if you can't volunteer please donate cuz she doesn't take corporate PAC she needs you guys to make this a reality kerryevelyn harris running for Senate and Delaware thank you so much for joining us appreciate you thank you so much for having me have a wonderful evening
