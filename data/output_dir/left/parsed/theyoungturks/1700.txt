DONALD GLOVER
A.K.A.
CHILDISH GAMBINO RELEASED
HIS NEW MUSIC VIDEO AND SONG
THIS WEEKEND THIS IS
AMERICA AND PEOPLE ARE VERY
EXCITED ABOUT IT.
THERE'S A LOT OF SYMBOLISM AND
COMMENTARY THAT WE ARE
GOING TO GET INTO NOW.
WE CAN'T SEE THE VIDEO BECAUSE
OF COPYRIGHT, BUT WE ARE
GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME
SCREENSHOTS AND GO INTO
SOME OF THE MOST PERTINENT AND
IMPORTANT SYMBOLISM THAT IS
PRESENT IN THE VIDEO.
THE FIRST IMAGE I WANT TO PULL
UP HERE, NOT THAT ONE.
MAYBE.
THE FIRST IMAGE IS OF HIM
SHOOTING THIS MAN HERE.
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS IN THE
BEGINNING HE STARTS DANCING
AND SMOTHERS DANCING IS VERY
EXAGGERATING.
SOME ARE SAYING THAT IT IS A
CHARACTER OF A CHARACTER.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT
IT RESEMBLES JIM CROW AND YOU
CAN SEE THAT IMAGE NOW, WHERE HE
IS BEING COMPARED IN THAT WAY.
YOU CAN SEE A LOT, EVEN THE
STANCES VERY SIMILAR THERE
AND SO HE IS IN THE STANDS WHILE
HE SHOOTS THIS MAN.
NOTHING HAPPENS, HE GIVES THE
GUN TO SOMEBODY.
THEY TAKE IT IN A RED CLOTH.
THEY ARE TREATING THE GUN VERY
NICELY AND THEN THE SORT
OF TRYING TO SHOW.
A LOT OF
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT IS A
COMMENTARY ON GUN VIOLENCE IN
AMERICA, HOW WE REALLY PUT GUNS
ON A PEDESTAL BEFORE HUMAN LIFE
AND I THINK WE HAVE SEEN THAT
TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND THAT
IS REALLY, DONALD GLOVER'S
COMMENTARY ON THIS.
THIS IS A BRILLIANT VIDEO
AND AN EXCELLENT POLITICAL,
SOCIAL COMMENTARY ON AMERICA.
IT IS NOT AN ACCIDENT THAT IT
IS CALLED THIS IS AMERICA,
FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO END THE
DEBATE AS TO IF HE MEANT IT.
OF COURSE HE MEANT IT.
WHEN HE SHOOTS THE GUY AND
NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE GUY BUT
THEY CARE ABOUT THE GUN AND THEY
TREATED SO GENTLY, THAT IS
OBVIOUSLY A STATEMENTS ON THE
CURRENT STATE OF AMERICA.
HIS EXAGGERATED DANCE MOVES ARE
AN OBVIOUS REFERENCE TO HOW
AMERICA VIEWS LACKS HISTORICALLY
AS ENTERTAINERS AND ARE HAPPY TO
HAVE THEM ENTERTAINED THEM, BUT
THEIR ACTUAL BODIES, THEIR
DEAD BODIES ARE LESS RELEVANT
AND DO NOT GET THE
ATTENTION AND HE REALLY
EMPHASIZED THAT IN THE VIDEO.
YOU CAN SEE THAT A LOT
BECAUSE HE IS DOING THESE VERY
POPULAR DANCE MOVES THAT WERE
MADE POPULAR BY PEOPLE WITHIN
THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND HE IS
DOING THAT AT THE FOREFRONT
WHILE IN THE BACKGROUND SO MUCH
IS GOING ON SO WE CAN GO
STRAIGHT TO THE NEXT ONE, WHERE
YOU CAN SEE HIM DANCING AROUND
WHERE ALL OF THIS VIOLENCE, A
POLICE CAR, ALL OF THIS
CRAZINESS IS GOING ON IN THE
BACKGROUND WHICH IS REALLY, TO
YOUR POINT, TALKING ABOUT HOW WE
ARE HAPPY TO ELEVATE BLACK
ENTERTAINERS, WE ARE HAPPY TO
APPRECIATE BLACK CULTURE AND
APPRECIATE BLACK MUSIC BUT THEN
WHEN IT COMES TO VIOLENCE
AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE, NOBODY
REALLY CARES.
EVERYBODY IS FOCUSING ON WHAT IS
ON THE FOREFRONT AND THAT
IS VERY PROBLEMATIC IN OUR
COUNTRY.
THIS IS AMERICA.
RIGHT SO THAT'S A COMEDY OF
HOW WE TREAT BLACK ENTERTAINERS
VERSUS THE FAR MORE COMMON
AFRICAN-AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IN
THIS COUNTRY IS WHAT HE IS
POINTING OUT AGAIN IN A WAY THAT
I THINK IS AMAZING.
SAYING LIKE, THE REAL PROBLEMS
ARE IN THE BACKGROUND AND
NO ONE CARES AND IN FACT, THEY
WILL ACTIVELY FIGHT AGAINST
IT, FIGHT AGAINST FIXING IT, BUT
AS LONG AS YOU ARE DANCING
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE AND
ENTERTAINING THEM THEY ARE
LIKE OKAY THAT IS GOOD, WE LIKE
THAT.
AND THEN OF COURSE THERE IS THE
CHARLESTON REFERENCE.
LET'S PULL UP THAT IMAGE
RIGHT NOW.
YOU CAN SEE THIS REAL
BACK-AND-FORTH IN THE VIDEO
BETWEEN JOY AND PAIN AND SO
THERE ARE THESE CHOIR
MEMBERS WHO THINK THEY'RE
SINGING THE CHORUS.
HE COMES IN WITH ONE LOOKS LIKE
SOME SORT OF SEMI AUTOMATIC
WEAPON AND HE HAS DANCING AND
THEN JUST SHOOT THEM ALL
WITHOUT EVEN BLINKING AN EYE,
KEEPS ON DANCING.
THE BODIES ARE LEFT JUST TO
REMAIN THERE WHEREAS THE GUN
AGAIN IS TAKEN CAREFULLY AWAY
FROM HIM AND HE REMAINS
UNTOUCHED, UNSCATHED WHICH IS
SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
2015 CHARLESTON SHOOTING WHERE
THIS MAN JUST WENT IN, SHOT UP
A CHURCH, HE WAS, HE
WENT TO JAIL BUT WAS NOT
TREATED FORCIBLY OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.
THE FAMOUS STORY ABOUT HOW
THEY TREATED THE CHARLESTON
SHOOTER WAS THAT ONCE THEY
ARRESTED HIM THEY TOOK HIM TO A
BURGER KING AND GOT A MEAL AND
SO THAT GOT UNDER A LOT OF
PEOPLE SKIN VERY UNDERSTANDABLY,
SO PEOPLE SAID A CHOIR, IS
THAT OVER-THE-TOP.
THE CHARLESTON SHOOTING HAPPENED
AT A CHURCH AND A BIBLE STUDY.
IT WAS A JOYOUS MOMENT, THE GUY
CAME IN AND MURDERS THEM
AND WALKS OUT AND THE COPS GIVE
HIM BURGER KING.
OF COURSE IT IS A REFERENCE TO
THAT AND WELL DONE, AGAIN.
PART OF THE SYMBOLISM HERE
IS HE IS SAYING IF ALL YOU
WERE GOING TO DO IS FOCUS ON US
SINGING AND ENTERTAINING
YOU THEN I AM GOING TO PUT IN
THE SONG AND I'M GOING TO
PUT IN THE VIDEO.
PERFECT.
I LOVE THAT.
EVERYTHING IN THIS VIDEO IS
SO GENIUS.
THE NEXT PART, HE SAYS THIS IS A
TOOL.
IT'S A REFERENCE TO STEPHON
CLARK, BUT ALSO THE FACT
THAT PEOPLE ARE NOW USING
CELL PHONES THROUGH THE
DOCUMENTS WHAT IS HAPPENING
WITHIN THE BLACK COMMUNITY
ESPECIALLY POLICE FOR TALLADEGA
AGAINST THEM AND IT IS SO
GREAT THAT HE TALKS ABOUT THAT.
YOU CAN USE THIS AS A TOOL AND I
LOVE THAT HE DOES THAT AND
THEN THE LAST SCENE IS HIM
RUNNING THROUGH THIS
EXTREMELY DARK HALLWAY WITH HIS
EYES BULGING AND MANY ARE
SAYING THAT THAT IS A REFERENCE
TO THE SUNKEN PLACE, IT'S A
REFERENCE BACK TO GET OUT.
THERE IS A LOT GOING ON IN
THIS VIDEO BUT IT IS GENIUS.
ALL OF THE SYMBOLISM IS THERE
AND I WATCHED IT AT LEAST FIVE
TIMES AND EVERY TIME I FELT
LIKE I NOTICED SOMETHING
DIFFERENT AND SOMETHING NEW AND
I AM PROBABLY MISSING STILL
HALF OF THE SYMBOLISM HE PUT
INTO THE STOCK
I AM TOO, AND I HOPE ONE DAY
HE EXPLAINS IT ALL OR MAYBE
HE DOESN'T AND LEAVES AS A WORK
OF ART.
THE STEPHON CLARK WAS SHOT BY
COPS IN HIS OWN BACKYARD.
HE HAD A CELL PHONE AND THE COPS
SAID THEY SHOT HIM BECAUSE
THEY WERE WORRIED IT WAS A TOOL.
THEY THOUGHT HE WAS USING IT TO
BREAK INTO CARS.
IT TURNS
OUT IT WAS A CELL PHONE AND HE
DID NOT HAVE A WEAPON AT ALL.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A REFERENCE
TO THE SUNKEN PLACE WHEN HE
IS RUNNING OUT OR JUST
COMMENTARY ON
AFRICAN-AMERICANS RUNNING FROM
THE POLICE AND OFTEN TIMES
PEOPLE WILL SAY WHY WERE THEY
RUNNING IN THE FIRST PLACE?
AFTER YOU HAVE SEEN ALL THE
CARNAGE IN THE VIDEO, WHO
IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD RUN?
EITHER WAY, INCREDIBLY WELL PUT
TOGETHER AND IT HAD THIS
FUNNY EFFECT ON ME.
THE SERIES ATLANTA IS A REALLY
WELL RECEIVED, IT HAS A TON
OF GREAT REVIEWS FROM CRITICS,
ETC.
BUT IT IS HARD TO KEEP
UP WITH ALL THE SHOWS THAT AFTER
WATCHING THIS VIDEO I AM
LIKE I'M GOING TO GO BACK AND
WATCH ATLANTA.
THIS GUY IS AWESOME.
I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAME
DIRECTOR.
HE IS AMAZING, HE IS
MULTITALENTED AND THERE SO
MANY THINGS IN THIS VIDEO.
ANOTHER ASPECT, ONE THING I WANT
TO BRING UP IS HE HAS THE
WHITE HORSE WITH THE CLOAKED
HENCHMEN ON IT WHICH IS A
REFERENCE TO THE APOCALYPSE AND
HE IS SAYING THIS IS AMERICA
AND THAT IS KIND OF HOW I FEEL
EVERY DAY BUT I CAN'T EVEN
IMAGINE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY
THAT IS GOING THROUGH ALL
OF THIS JUST CONSTANT VIOLENCE
AND DISRESPECT BY OUR COUNTRY.
IT IS APPARENTLY THE FIRST
HORSE OF THE APOCALYPSE AND
IT IS THE BACKGROUND WHILE HE IS
STILL DANCING AND EVERYONE
IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THE
DANCING.
THE APOCALYPSE HAS BEGUN.
