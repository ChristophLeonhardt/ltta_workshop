A JOKE HAS REVOKED HIS BOND.
HE HAS BEEN ON HOUSE ARREST.
THE REASON HE VIOLATED THE TERMS
OF HIS RELEASE, BY WITNESS 
TAMPERING.
THIS IS A MAJOR EVENT, ALL OF 
THIS HAPPENING UNDER THE 
UMBRELLA OF THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION INTO 
COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA IN THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
MANAFORT RAN THE CAMPAIGN JUST 
BEFORE AND JUST AFTER THE 
NOMINATIING CONVENTION.
THIS STEMS BEFORE HIS TIME WITH 
THE CAMPAIGN, AND WE WANT TO 
MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR.
HE WAS BROUGHT IN BY TRUMP'S 
CHILDREN WHO WANTED A CHANGE 
FROM LEWANDOWSKI.
MANAFORT IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST 
RANKING CAMPAIGN AIDES TO FACE 
CHARGES.
HE IS FACING CHARGES RELATED TO 
MONEY LAUNDERING, BANK FRAUD AND
OTHERS.
HE IS PLEADING NOT GUILTY.
I WANT TO GO TO PIERRE THOMAS IN
WASHINGTON FOR THE VERY LATEST, 
AND PIERRE, JUDGE AMY BERMAN 
JACKSON IS MAKING IT CLEAR SHE 
DOES NOT TRUST PAUL MANAFORT TO 
FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES OF HIS 
HOUSE ARREST, AND THIS MAY BE 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST DEVELOPMENTS 
SO FAR IN THIS CASE.
>> Reporter: SHE TOOK THE 
ALLEGATIONS OF OBSTRUCTION OF 
JUSTICE SERIOUSLY.
THE NOTION THAT HE WAS REACHING 
OUT TO WITNESSES AND THAT IS 
WHAT THE PROSECUTION, AND THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE IS HE 
WAS REACHING OUT TO WITNESSES 
TRYING TO INFLUENCE THEIR 
TESTIMONY.
ONE OF THE WITNESSES ACCORDING 
TO THE PROSECUTION SAID THAT 
MANAFORT WAS TRYING TO SUB BORN 
PERJURY.
THE JUDGE TOOK THAT SERIOUSLY.
SHE SAID HE WILL BE DETAINED, 
PENDING TRIAL.
SHE SAID IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT
DECISION, BUT SHE BASICALLY SAID
THAT MANAFORT HAD NOT BEEN 
TREATING THE CASE SERIOUSLY 
ENOUGH, AND THAT SHE HAS REASON 
TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS BEEN 
COMMITTING CRIMES AND WOULD 
CONTINUE TO DO SO, TOM. 
>> AND PIERRE, MANY OF 
MANAFORT'S FRIENDS SAID THEY 
BELIEVE THIS ENTIRE CASE BECAUSE
IT PREDATES THE CAMPAIGN IS 
ABOUT PUTTING PRESSURE ON 
MANAFORT TO GIVE UP WHAT COULD 
BE POTENTIALLY DAMAGING 
INFORMATION ON THE PRESIDENT. 
>> Reporter: THEY ARE PLAYING 
HARDBALL, PUTTING PRESSURE ON 
MANAFORT THROUGH THE MYRIAD OF 
CHARGES FILED AGAINST HIM, BUT 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT TO 
OUR VIEWERS THAT THESE CHARGES 
STEM FROM ALLEGATIONS OF ACTIONS
THAT TOOK PLACE AFTER A 
SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT WAS 
LEVIED AGAINST MANAFORT.
THEY CLAIMED THAT AFTER THOSE 
CHARGES WERE FILED, MANAFORT 
REACHED OUT TO AT LEAST TWO 
WITNESSES, TRIED TO CONTACT 
THEM, DID COMMUNICATE WITH THEM,
AND THEN TRIED TO GET THEM -- 
ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT -- 
TO CHANGE THEIR POTENTIAL 
TESTIMONY. 
>> I WANT TO GO TO OUR CHIEF 
LEGAL ANALYST, DAN ABRAMS.
WE UNDERSTAND HE WILL BE 
DETAINED PENDING TRIAL, AND THAT
COULD LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT HE
IS POSSIBLY ON HIS WAY TO JAIL?
>> YEAH.
I MEAN, MEANING THAT WHEN THIS 
DECISION IS MADE IN ALL 
LIKELIHOOD, IT MEANS HE WON'T 
LEAVE THE COURTROOM A FREE MAN, 
AND, YOU KNOW, REMEMBER THOUGH, 
WHEN IT.
COS 
CO -- COMES TO THE PURPOSES OF 
BAIL OR BOND, YOU KNOW, THERE 
ARE TWO THINGS YOU'RE TRYING TO 
DO.
NUMBER ONE, YOU'RE TRYING TO 
MAKE SURE A PERSON SHOWS UP, AND
NUMBER TWO, YOU'RE TRYING TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THE TERMS OF 
THEIR RELEASE ARE ABIDED BY, AND
THE FOCUS HERE IS REALLY ON 
NUMBER TWO.
THERE IS NO INDICATION THUS FAR 
THAT MANAFORT IS GOING TO FLEE.
THE CONCERN IS THAT SIMPLY HE 
HAS NOT BEEN ABIDING BY THE 
TERMS OF HIS BAIL, AND SO THAT 
MEANS THAT NOW HE IS GOING TO BE
HELD.
THEY CAN APPEAL THIS.
THEY CAN TRY TO GET THE JUDGE TO
CHANGE HURT MIND DOWN THE ROAD, 
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T LOOK 
GOOD.
FOR NOW, THIS MEANS THAT PAUL 
MANAFORT IS GOING TO JAIL. 
>> I WANT TO READ YOU QUOTES 
FROM THE JUDGE'S DECISION.
SHE SAID, I STRUGGLE WITH THIS 
DECISION, AND I HAVE NO APPETITE
FOR THIS IN THE END.
I CAN'T TURN A BLIND EYE TO 
THESE ALLEGATIONS.
CLEARLY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S 
EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD VIOLATED 
THE HOUSE ARREST AND POSSIBLY 
HAD DONE SOME WITNESS TAMPERING 
WAS VERY CLEAR.
>> AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
NOTE.
YOU HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING,
YOU KNOW, HOW MUCH PRESSURE 
MANAFORT IS BEING PUT ON BY THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL, THAT PEOPLE ARE
TRYING TO GET HIM TO FLIP OR TO 
TALK.
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S SIMPLER 
THAN THAT, WHICH IS I THINK THIS
IS THE SPECIAL COUNSEL GOING BY 
THE LETTER OF THE LAW AND 
SAYING, LOOK.
ONE OF THE TERMS OF YOUR RELEASE
WAS THAT YOU WOULDN'T REACH OUT 
TO ANY OTHER POTENTIAL 
WITNESSES, AND NOT ONLY DID YOU 
DO THAT, YOU TRIED TO INFLUENCE,
ACCORDING TO THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL'S OFFICE, THAT WITNESS.
NOW I THINK THAT THIS IS NOT 
ABOUT TRYING TO GET MANAFORT TO 
FLIP AS MUCH AS IT IS TO SIMPLY 
FORCING MANAFORT TO ABIDE BY 
WHAT WERE THE TERMS OF HIS 
RELEASE.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANALYSIS.
PIERRE THOMAS HAS NEW REPORTING.
LET'S GO BACK TO HIM.
>> Reporter: WE HAVE SOME COLOR 
FROM THE COURTROOM.
THE MARSHALS LED MANAFORT AWAY 
FROM THE COURT, AND HE RETURNED 
TO HIS WIFE AFTER HE WAVED TO 
HER AND GAVE HER HIS BELT, 
WALLET AND THOSE ITEMS.
HE IS CLEARLY LIKELY GOING TO 
JAIL TODAY. 
>> PIERRE, YOU HAVE BEEN 
COVERING THIS FROM THE GET GO, 
FROM WHEN THE CHARGES FIRST CAME
DOWN BACK IN OCTOBER OF 2017.
HOW BIG IS THIS DAY RIGHT NOW ON
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO PAUL 
MANAFORT?
>> Reporter: CLEARLY, HE WAS A 
FORMER CHAIN CHAIRMAN FOR THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
CLEARLY A VERY SENIOR OFFICIAL 
NOW FACING SERIOUS CHARGES.
TODAY, BEING LED TO JAIL PENDING
TRIAL.
THIS IS EXTREMELY UNUSUAL FOR A 
WHITE COLLAR SUSPECTED CRIMINAL 
TO BE HELD PENDING TRIAL, AND 
THE JUDGE JUST SAID THAT HIS 
FLIGHT RISK HAS MULTIPLIED, AND 
SHE PUT THAT TOGETHER IN THIS 
DECISION.
>> WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE 
PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY, AND SO 
FAR, NO RESPONSE YET.
WE WANT TO GO TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE.
KYRA PHILLIPS IS STANDING BY.
YOU SPOKE WITH THE PRESIDENT 
TODAY.
HE HAS BEEN ON HIS OWN CAMPAIGN 
SINCE THE CHARGES FIRST CAME 
DOWN AGAINST PAUL MANAFORT 
SAYING HE HAD VERY LITTLE TO DO 
WITH THE CAMPAIGN.
THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY TRUE 
BECAUSE HE HAD AN IMPORTANT ROLE
JUST BEFORE THE CONVENTION AND 
JUST AFTER THE CONVENTION MAKING
SURE HE SECURED THE NOMINATION.
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT SAYING 
TODAY?
>> Reporter: WELL, LET ME GET 
BACK TO THAT IN JUST A SECOND.
THIS IS COMING OUT RIGHT NOW, 
TOM.
ACTUALLY, I CAN TELL YOU THAT 
SOURCES CLOSE TO THE TRUMP LEGAL
TEAM -- THIS IS BEING TOLD TO 
ABC NEWS RIGHT NOW -- SOURCES 
CLOSE TO THE TRUMP LEGAL TEAM 
ARE STUNNED BY THE MANAFORT 
DECISION.
STUNNED BY THE MANAFORT 
DECISION, AND YOU MENTIONED THE 
GAGGLE THAT HAPPENED HERE TODAY.
THAT WAS UNPRECEDENTED.
THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
THE PRESIDENT HAS NEVER WALKED 
OUT FROM THE MANSION AND STOOD 
BEHIND WHERE WE ALL GO LIVE AND 
ACTUALLY TALKED TO THE PRESS FOR
20 MINUTES, TOM.
IT WAS QUITE REMARKABLE, BUT IN 
THE INTERVIEW, I DID ASK HIM IN 
THAT SHORT GAGGLE I SHOULD SAY, 
DO YOU THINK THAT MANAFORT 
SHOULD GO TO JAIL?
IT'S THE ONLY TIME HE TURNED 
AWAY FROM ME AND DIDN'T ANSWER 
MY QUESTIONS.
A COUPLE OF OTHER QUESTIONS WERE
THROWN OUT.
I WILL TELL YOU AS TRUMP HAS 
BEEN TRYING TO DISTANCE HIMSELF 
FROM MANAFORT LATELY, HE DID 
TELL ALL OF US AS A GROUP THAT 
HIS FORMER CHAIRMAN, QUOTE, HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR CAMPAIGN.
HE ALSO WENT ON TO SAY THAT PAUL
MANAFORT WORKED FOR ME FOR A 
VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
HE WORKED FOR ME, ME, WHAT?
49 DAYS OR SOMETHING?
HE ACTUALLY SERVED AS YOU 
MENTIONED ON TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN 
FOR NEARLY SIX MONTHS IN 2016.
THE PRESIDENT'S SAYING 49 DAYS 
OR SO.
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAYING TODAY 
HE HAS NOT SPOKEN TO PAUL 
MANAFORT.
TOM?
>> KYRA PHILLIPS WITH THAT NEW 
REPORTING.
WE THANK YOU.
A LARGE DEVELOPMENT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER 
CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN FROM THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN NOW ON HIS WAY TO JAIL.
WE'LL RETURN NOW TO REGULAR 
PROGRAMMING.
IN SOME STARTS OF THE COUNTRY, 
THAT WILL BE "GOOD MORNING 
AMERICA."
THERE WILL BE A WRAP-UP ON 
"WORLD NEWS TONIGHT," AND YOU 
CAN GET THAT AND ALL OF OUR 
UPDATES IN REALTIME AT 
ABCNEWS.COM.
I'M TOM LLAMAS IN NEW YORK.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.
>> Announcer: THIS HAS BEEN A 
SPECIAL REPORT FROM ABC NEWS.
