>>TODAY DON'T TRUMP SPOKE AT THE
VALUES VOTERS SUMMIT, THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME A SITTING
PRESIDENT HAS SPOKEN AT IT.
THERE ARE REASONS FOR THAT,
SINCE IT'S AN ANTI-GAY AND IN
MANY WAYS ANTIWOMAN GATHERING,
YOU WILL LOVE HIS COMMENTARY,
BUT I WANT TO TOUCH ON ONE THING
HE SAID FIRST.
HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE DISASTER RELIEF EFFORT
THAT IS ONGOING, HIM TRAVELING
TO TEXAS AND PUERTO RICO, AND HE
ALSO SAID HE TRAVELED TO THE
VIRGIN ISLANDS, WHICH OF COURSE
WERE DESTROYED IN A WAY THAT
EVEN OTHER HARD-HIT AREAS WERE
NOT, AND HE WENT THERE AND HE
SPOKE TO THEIR LEADER, THE
PRESIDENT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.
WHICH IS ODD BECAUSE HE'S THE
PRESIDENT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS,
SINCE IT'S AN UNINCORPORATED
TERRITORY OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.
THAT IS WORRYING, THAT HE WENT
THERE AND DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW
WHO HE WAS THAT HE WAS SPEAKING
TO, THEY HAVE A GOVERNOR, NOT A
PRESIDENT, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
ARE JOKING ABOUT, BUT MY FEAR IS
THAT IF HE THINKS THEY HAVE A
PRESIDENT, DOES HE NOT KNOW THAT
WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HAPPENS
THERE?
CAN YOU REALLY TRUST HIS
DISASTER RELIEF EFFORTS IF HE
THINKS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN FULLY
SEPARATE GOVERNMENT AND WE ARE
THEIR ALLY OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?
>>WHAT DOES HE THINK IT SAYS
THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS?
>>IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK HE
HAD TO GET WALKED THROUGH THE
PUERTO RICO THING.
I'M SURE THEY
DID IT IN A WAY SO AS NOT TO
PISS HIM OFF BUT I DON'T THINK
HE FULLY UNDERSTOOD, MR.
PRESIDENT, WE HAVE TO TAKE
CARE OF PUERTO RICO, THIS IS
AMERICA.
>>JOHN, DOES HE NOT KNOW THAT
THE VIRGIN ISLANDS ARE AN
AMERICAN TERRITORY,
UNINCORPORATED -- ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?
OF COURSE HE DOESN'T
KNOW.
>>UNLESS THERE IS A TRUMP
PROPERTY THERE I DON'T
THINK HE COULD FIND THE VIRGIN
ISLANDS.
>>CAN I JUST SAY ONE LAST THING?
DIES, JUST THINK ABOUT, OKAY, HE
DOESN'T KNOW, I KEEP USING THE
TWO PROFESSIONS, PLUMBER OR
DENTIST, A PLUMBER IN NORTH
CAROLINA, A DENTIST IN
CONNECTICUT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE VIRGIN
ISLANDS IS, THAT'S FINE.
YOU ARE
THE PRESIDENT, THE VIRGIN
ISLANDS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED, YOU
ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT, AND
IF YOU AREN'T SURE CAN YOU JUST
DO 10 SECONDS OF HOMEWORK AND
ASK AN AIDE, YOU HAVE THOUSANDS
OF THEM, WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH
THE VIRGIN ISLANDS?
HOW SHOULD I
REFER TO THEIR LEADER?
MR.
PRESIDENT, YOU ARE THEIR
LEADER, THAT'S THE GOVERNOR.
GREAT, THANK GOD YOU TOLD ME
BEFORE THE CAMERAS ARRIVED.
HE DOESN'T CARE TO DO 10 SECONDS
OF HOMEWORK.
>>MY QUESTION IS, HOW MANY
TIMES DID HE REFER TO THE
GOVERNOR AS PRESIDENT AND NOBODY
CORRECTED HIM?
>>THAT'S A GREAT POINT, THERE IS
A WHOLE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES
THING GOING ON WITH TRUMP AND
ONCE IN A WHILE WHEN HE STEPS IN
IT BIG TIME IN TERMS OF A PUBLIC
RELATIONS THING, WHEN HE
SAYS SOMETHING THAT'S TOTALLY
FUNKY, SHIT, WHAT DO WE DO
WITH THIS, I THINK THAT'S WHEN
WE END UP, YOU KNOW --
>>THIS IS SCARY, THE VIRGIN
ISLANDS IS DESTROYED, PUERTO
RICO, IT HAS BEEN WEEKS AND IT'S
STILL IN HORRIBLE CONDITIONS,
THEY HAD TO PUT OUT A WARNING TO
TELL PEOPLE NOT TO DRINK FROM
SEALED CONTAINERS IN SUPERFUND
SITES BECAUSE OF THE
CONTAMINATION THROUGH TOXINS AND
POTENTIALLY NUCLEAR STUFF, BUT
PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO DO THAT
BECAUSE THERE IS NO WATER.
WEEKS
INTO THIS DISASTER AMERICAN
CITIZENS ARE HAVING TO DRINK
TOXIC FLUIDS BECAUSE THEY DON'T
WANT TO LITERALLY DIE OF
DEHYDRATION, AND WE HAVE A GUY
WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
TERRITORIES HE'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR.
THERE ARE MORE CONSEQUENCES
AND HIGHER STANDARDS FOR ROCK
STARS WHO SAY THE WRONG CITY
WHEN THEY OPEN A SHOW THAN THE
PRESIDENT WHEN HE VISITS THE
GOVERNOR OF U.S. TERRITORY,
THAT'S A SCARY STATE FOR US TO
BE IN.
