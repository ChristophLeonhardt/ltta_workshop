1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,939
Obviously you and I could talk
for hours about our differences

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:06,640
on Trump.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,598
But that’s not why I want
to talk to today as you know.

4
00:00:08,598 --> 00:00:11,160
In recent
days you’ve inaugurated

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,260
the phrase "Former Trumpers."

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,800
What are Former Trumpers and why
should he be terrified of them?

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,656
The Former Trumpers should keep
Donald Trump awake at night.

8
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:24,030
We’re the ones who didn’t care
about the Access Hollywood

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,600
tape.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,250
He had absolute rock solid
locked us in on support

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,260
because we thought we
wouldn’t be betrayed.

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,280
Finally, finally, he could sell Ivanka Trump

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,280
merchandise from the Oval
Office if he would just

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,530
build the wall.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,200
If he doesn’t have us anymore –

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,450
No, that’s what he should be
worried about because

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,150
you play those
people for suckers?

18
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,940
The one who stood by him through
thick and thin and thought this

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,160
was finally something different.

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,860
Finally, we have a politician
who’s not going to lie to us.

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,440
No, Former Trumpers should
put the fear of God in him.

22
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,140
One month into Donald
Trump’s presidency

23
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,310
you said so far I’d give him an
A plus.

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,030
What was...

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,920
One month in.

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,920
So far I give him an A plus.

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,530
Well, he’s turned in several
more papers at this point,

28
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,840
and there have been
some final exams and pop

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,790
quizzes. What’s his grade today?

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,820
We’re halfway through
the semester and he’s failing.

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,860
He could still get ahead.

32
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,100
There’s still a shot
for extra credit.

33
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,640
Let me guess: It
involves a wall?

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,660
Well, don’t act like I'm the nut

35
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,120
wanting a wall.

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,350
That was the chant
at every rally.

37
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,840
I didn't make this up.

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,970
But let’s be adults here.
Was Mexico ever going

39
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,690
to pay for it?

40
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,617
His voters absolutely
do not care.

41
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:44,700
He promised that as often
as he promised the wall.

42
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,030
I know.

43
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,696
But it was like me
giving him an A plus.

44
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:47,696
It was just a fun chant.

45
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:48,945
"And who’s going to pay for it?"

46
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:49,540
I promise you.

47
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,280
We want a wall.

48
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,020
We don’t care who pays for it.

49
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,490
So how much does
he have to worry

50
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,490
politically about Former Trumpers?

51
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,420
If he doesn't change course –

52
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,300
No, they’re never coming back.

53
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,800
Are you,

54
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,970
are you now a Former Trumper? Yes?

55
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,460
Look, he can still come back.

56
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,960
You are a temporary Former Trumper?

57
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,980
If he builds the wall.

58
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,919
He will be the emperor-god again.

59
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,919
You are a resurrected Trumper?

60
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:10,918
I'll throw a huge party.

61
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,890
He’ll be, I’ll
start a committee

62
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,290
to put him on Mount Rushmore.

63
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,420
But right now, if I
were a betting woman,

64
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,600
I don’t think we’re
getting a wall.

65
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,221
One of the things
that most stunned me

66
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:24,720
as his administration
came together

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,620
was he spent so much time during
the campaign railing against

68
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,360
Wall Street, fashioning
himself as a populist.

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,230
This was the richest cabinet,

70
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:32,666
I think,

71
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:33,320
-Yep, it was.

72
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,855
in history.

73
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:35,920
What’s driving me
crazy is every time

74
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,490
I hear somebody's leaving,

75
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,350
I get excited,

76
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,940
and then I find out who it’s
being replaced with.

77
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,160
To just, to kind of be a little bit
more complete and nuanced.

78
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,540
You said that, you
implied that Trump

79
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,351
was governing so that
Jared and Ivanka didn’t lose

80
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:48,600
their friends in the Hamptons.

81
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,610
You can’t hire your kids!

82
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,030
We don’t like nepotism.

83
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,010
We’re Americans.

84
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,781
This is third world behavior.

85
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:56,030
They’re perfectly nice people.

86
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,660
So the two of them
have no business

87
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,830
being in the advisory roles?

88
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,420
O.K., it was Jared’s
idea to fire Comey.

89
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,030
It was Jared’s idea to hire
Scaramucci.

90
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,540
At any point does it,

91
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:08,880
does it,

92
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,350
dawn on someone?

93
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,080
Now, every time I take
this guy’s advice

94
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,180
disaster ensues.

95
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,180
It doesn't seem to be hitting home.

96
00:03:18,180 --> 00:00:00,000
Why? Because it’s a relative.
