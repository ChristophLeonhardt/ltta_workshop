1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:02,666
THEY ARE GOING TO AVOID THOSE

2
00:00:02,667 --> 00:00:03,701
LABELS OR GETTING THE TREATMENT

3
00:00:03,702 --> 00:00:04,401
THAT WILL WORK.

4
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:05,736
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR

5
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:07,504
INSIGHT, PROFESSOR.

6
00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:09,773
OBAMA'S WHITE HOUSE WAS THE

7
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:11,842
REVOLVING DOOR FOR CELEBRITIES.

8
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:15,279
REMEMBER WHEN HE HAD THE SUMMIT

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,416
WITH RAPPERS LUDACRIS.

10
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:20,951
YOU PROBABLY DON'T BECAUSE THE

11
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:22,519
LEFT WING MEDIA DIDN'T FREAK OUT

12
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,187
OVER IT.

13
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:27,324
JOINING US WITH REACTION, DOUBLE

14
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:29,326
STANDARD HOWIE KIRT.

15
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:31,195
HOWIE, MEDIA BUZZ, GREAT SHOW ON

16
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:32,329
THE WEEKENDS ON FOX.

17
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,163
THIS IS WILD.

18
00:00:33,164 --> 00:00:34,832
I REMEMBER WHEN KANYE CAME AND

19
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:40,671
DID HIS POETRY SLAM AT THE WHITE

20
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:40,971
HOUSE.

21
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:42,573
TRUTH BE TOLD, I KIND OF LAUGHED

22
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:43,407
AT IT.

23
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:44,775
I THOUGHT THE POEM WAS REALLY

24
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:46,543
BAD HE DID ON STAGE.

25
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:48,445
OBAMA WAS REALLY AT EASE WITH

26
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:48,846
CELEBRITIES.

27
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:49,813
OBVIOUSLY, THEY LOVED HIM.

28
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:51,281
NO ONE CARED.

29
00:00:51,282 --> 00:00:53,617
>> OBAMA'S CELEBRITIES AND

30
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:55,819
RAPPERS THEY HAD THE APPROVED

31
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,186
IDEOLOGY.

32
00:00:56,187 --> 00:00:58,122
THE MEDIA KIND OF CELEBRATED IT.

33
00:00:58,123 --> 00:00:59,890
LOOK, WHAT KANYE DID IN THE OVAL

34
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:01,792
OFFICE, IT IS FINE FOR CRITICS

35
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:05,129
TO SAY, IT WAS WEIRD, STRANGE,

36
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:05,562
BIZARRE.

37
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:07,131
EVEN DONALD TRUMP SEEMED KIND OF

38
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:11,669
SPEECHLESS FOR A MOMENT BUT THE

39
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,304
BRUTAL NATURE OF THE CRITICISM

40
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:15,973
IS DRIVEN BY IDEOLOGY.

41
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:17,841
WHEN KANYE WEST WAS TALKING

42
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:19,143
ABOUT, GEORGE BUSH DOESN'T CARE

43
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:21,078
ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE, A LOT OF THE

44
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,813
LIBERALS SAID HE IS A COOL DUDE.

45
00:01:22,814 --> 00:01:24,782
BECAUSE HE IS WEARING THE RED

46
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:26,216
HAT AND EMBRACING DONALD TRUMP,

47
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:27,484
HE MUST BELOW GO.

48
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,053
>> WHAT ARE THE CHANCES NEXT

49
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:30,954
WEEK HE WILL BE WEARING A CORY

50
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:31,522
BOOKER HAT?

51
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:33,090
IS THERE ANY CHANCE?

52
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:35,759
>> JACQUE SPIRE, CONGRESSWOMAN

53
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,229
FROM CALIFORNIA SAID THIS ABOUT

54
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,831
KANYE AND HIS MENTAL HEALTH.

55
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:43,000
>> IT WAS A COMBINATION OF

56
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:44,101
STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

57
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:46,603
I FELT LIKE I WAS SITTING IN ON

58
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:48,338
A PSYCHIATRIC VISIT AND A

59
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:50,074
COMMERCIAL FOR DONALD TRUMP.

60
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:52,176
IT WASN'T NEWSWORTHY CERTAINLY

61
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:55,245
BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE

62
00:01:55,246 --> 00:01:58,749
PRESIDENT SHOULD MAYBE CURTAIL

63
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,820
THESE KINDS OF ENGAGEMENTS.

64
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,255
36% APPROVAL FROM RASMUSSEN

65
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:06,356
AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

66
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:10,694
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE MORE O

67
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,129
WORRIED ABOUT KANYE'S EFFECT ON

68
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,997
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS THAN HIS

69
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:14,531
MENTAL HEALTH.

70
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:16,834
>> IN ADDITION TO THE

71
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,302
CONGRESSWOMAN, IT SEEMS LIKE THE

72
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:20,437
HARSHEST CRITICISM IS COMING

73
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:22,873
FROM OTHER AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

74
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:25,209
DON LEMON BRINGING HIS LATE

75
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,443
MOTHER INTO IT.

76
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:29,113
CNN SAID HE WAS A TOKEN NEGRO.

77
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:30,414
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT PHRASE IN

78
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:30,748
DECADES.

79
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,683
IT IS ROOTED IN THE NOTION THAT

80
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:35,719
BLACK PEOPLE WHO ARE FOR

81
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,887
SOMEBODY LIKE DONALD TRUMP, THEY

82
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:38,622
CAN'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING

83
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:39,022
ABOUT.

84
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:40,090
THEY ARE COMPLETELY MISS

85
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:41,592
INFORMED AND THEY HAVE SERIOUS

86
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:42,926
ISSUES AND ALL THAT.

87
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:45,195
THEY NO LONGER HAVE A MONOPOLY.

88
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:47,564
THE PILING ON ABOUT KANYE WEST,

89
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:48,632
PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW THAT MUCH

90
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:51,268
MORE ABOUT POLITICS.

91
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:54,805
>> MORE SO THAN WHO, MATT DAMON?

92
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:57,040
>> HE WAS THERE TO TALK ABOUT A

93
00:02:57,041 --> 00:00:00,000
SERIOUS ISSUE.
