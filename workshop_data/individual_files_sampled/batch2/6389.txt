one company that hasn't been bowing to pressure to eliminate special deals or discounts with the NRA so far is a FedEx and here is what they've said publicly after a lot of outcry about their special discounts for the NRA FedEx has never provided any donation or sponsorship to the NRA which is one of hundreds of Alliance and Association participants that serve more than 1 million customers that is both true and has absolutely nothing to do with the discount which they do offer but they're saying you know we're we are a common carrier we can't make decisions based on politics and all that which theoretically could be true but it turns out might not actually be what is driving them now they've attempted to muddy the waters with the ups they said this on Tuesday they said that the the NRA used ups for shipping merchandise for its online store with the idea being that yell squirrel and people go after the UPS but we're gonna stay on FedEx for just a little bit because what's interesting is the policies for shipping guns in this country there's not a lot of companies that can actually do it there's just a few the the USPS won't mail handguns except under rare circumstances meaning that almost all handgun shipments need to go through the UPS or FedEx and UPS requires that all handguns be shipped overnight according to its website which as you can imagine is very expensive now what's interesting is that FedEx is public policy is a lot like you UPS's firearms must be shipped via FedEx priority overnight service according to the company's 2018 service guide which if you just look at what's public it looks like totally fair ups on the one side FedEx on the other side unfortunately an inside source of FedEx provided Think Progress with some internal company documents that were not intended to be leaked that said that some customers have been approved for an exception to ship firearms with a two-day AM or PM service which is much less expensive and what's interesting is that those exceptions include 86 firearms manufacturers and dealers including nearly every major company in the business like Smith & Wesson Colt Glock 6 our and the NRA itself actually if you can bring up this graphic you're gonna see it is an extensive list those are all firearms manufacturers or distributors and what's interesting is that they're publicly saying you have to ship it overnight so what the idea being that it would be just as expensive his UPS but instead you can actually ship it in two or three day saving a ton of money which means that UPS is not gonna get a lot of that business the FedEx is secretly gonna get a lot of business which implies that what they've been publicly saying about the NRA ain't actually true yeah I'm gonna throw a little bit of a curveball here I don't mind this so much so obviously I'm very opposed to that are anybody who watches the show knows that I support the United States Post Office which is not a lot of people say but I'm proud to support it it's a thousand times cheaper and actually gets you the stuff there okay and I hear they work under all conditions they do so I'm brain or alright but having said all that so they're trying to hose their competitor by secretly giving deals to these companies it happens to be gun companies but they could also be saying don't we won't take any kind of thing except overnight delivery for all ham sandwiches okay and then turn to the ham sandwich companies would be like yeah I'll take it don't take today okay you're gonna ship a ham sound she got really a anaise you're taking a real chance there yeah I hear you but but you see my point so it's it's not that big a gotcha so yeah they're publicly saying okay and I really don't have any special deal or anything when they have a gigantic financial interest in the NRA and gun manufacturers I'm not sure they didn't say we didn't have any special deal they just said oh we're not gonna do the discounts anymore for the other members no they're still doing the discount by the way they're saying we don't have we don't do donations or sponsorships they still have the discount they're still gonna do the discount they also have this special deal yeah that is announced but that makes it even less hypocritical right so yeah they're like yeah we work with NRA we're gonna keep you giving their members discounts which I don't agree with but they that's what they're doing they are secretly giving them a deal okay and the UPS ha ha so hey look if that bothers you and you're the boycott kind of person then use UPS next time but not FedEx perhaps I will okay bothers me they put out this huge statement saying we totally take guns seriously and you know we FedEx was affected by a mass shooting within the past couple of years like six or seven people died we take this extremely seriously we don't think people should have access to these guns but on the other hand we're not gonna stake out a political position so we're just trying to stay neutral by the way give me some more of that money I'm gonna ship all your guns every single one of your guns give me all your money I can that that seems that seems shady to me okay it lasts a couple links here one that's what companies do they do shady things to make money yes and this is what TYT does we point it out okay all right and it's not that shady it's just it's a little underhand but it's not underhanded today public its underhanded to their competitor that's why I don't care or mind right so and okay and and it's not kidding aside it's not did you shady stuff to make money they their job is to maximize profit they think this maximizes profit I get it right and let's note for the record that John doing this was kind of disturbing in the Middle East where he is this is how you take money if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be saying get home like a smart person or you might say I think it's weird or you might say oops no that won't be that one it won't be that one it'll be great trust me TYT Network comm slash joy
