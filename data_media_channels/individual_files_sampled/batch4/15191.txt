well free speech hater ikura Khalid is at it again the driving force behind the anti Islamophobia motion apparently doesn't like being mocked on Twitter so naturally she's doing everything in her power to clamp down on this sort of dastardly discourse too have you seen any of the Iraqi lead parody Twitter accounts if so the liberal MP really really wishes that you'd tune those out her feelings are being hurt after all for what others see as humorous she sees as being tantamount to hate speech but of course isn't everything for starters according to a Canadian Press story miss Khalid feels she should be exempt from parody Twitter accounts because she's not a cabinet minister such as climate Barbie like that's a rule or something that only members of the cabinet should get their chops busted on Twitter what a nut but here's a line that I really love from the CP story quote while some of the parody accounts criticize government policy or poke fun at various ministers the collied account points out her Muslim heritage and accuses her of supporting Islamic state militants or Sharia law at least one parody account of Immigration Minister Ahmed Husein who is also Muslim features similar sentiments end quote sorry but methinks this scenario falls within the bailiwick of live by the sword after all two leads motion m103 is all about condemning systemic racism and Islamophobia yes that's right Islamophobia as opposed to all the other phobias and all the other isms out there gets a special mention well isn't that special yeah so in one regard khalid herself brings special mention to islam when it comes to her anti racism motion but when other single out islam for parody well sorry that's just not allow double standard much and yet as she campaigns for the fake twitter accounts to be removed khalid has the utter gall to state this quote everybody has the right to speak their mind but freedoms come with responsibility and when we have the power to speak we should do it with care end quote sorry but by her own actions and words clear the collied herself doesn't believe everyone should be free to speak their mind and just how is it that she's the self-proclaimed champion of so-called responsible free speech like who's watching the Watchers here or is the utter irony lost on her and yet she also states this whopper in her interview with cpe quote it's unfortunate that they are spreading fake news and sowing fear and division end quote o division you say kind of like the language in your own motion ikura that basically boils down to this all racism is bad and should be condemned but Islamophobia is especially bad and needs to be especially condemned because islam is exceptional you mean that kind of division ikura don't forget to carry the one and hate to be impatient here but I believe we still don't have a definition of Islamophobia as it pertains to m103 then again maybe that AWOL definition is entirely on purpose perhaps Islamophobia is not being defined so that this term can mean just about anything to anyone you know that even mockery in a Twitter parody account that insults the oh so sensitive sensibilities of equal Khalid is by default Islamophobic oh great Khalid please forgive us our trespasses for the rebel dawn media I'm David the man Zoid Menzies hey folks rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
