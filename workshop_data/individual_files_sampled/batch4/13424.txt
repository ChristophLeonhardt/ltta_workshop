Jimmy Kimmel trotted out his child again last night and I hate this more than I can tell you when people do this hey I can safely say because it has been scientifically verified that I have the two cutest children on planet Earth in fact I have a child of three and a half years a girl three and a half years old who is so cute date last night she actually started doing lines from the room and no I'm not kidding she is amazing but she also happened to have a heart condition she had an open heart surgery that was performed at the same but all by the same doctor is jimmy kimmel son and yet i do not routinely trot out my daughter's stories whenever i talk about health care what i'm talking about Obamacare policy i don't say and i know about this because my daughter had her chest cut open because they had to fix an ASD a hole in her heart I don't do that because it's stupid I don't do that because I don't think that there's virtue in victimhood I don't think that just because something bad happened to you in life that means that now you know more about that thing than anyone else I think that this this reference to personal experience when it comes to policy matters is actually the end of policy because the reality is it's it's very watered down form of identity politics the reality is that politics is based on the idea that I can talk about ideas and you can talk about ideas because we can sympathize with one another because we can think what it would be like to walk in one another's shoes without actually having walked in those shoes if talk about healthcare is restricted to only those who've used the healthcare system if talked about about about financial systems is restricted to only those who have worked in the financial system then pretty quickly we are going to come to the end of politics we can all have opinions on matters of public policy specifically because we have the capacity as independent human beings to think about what all of these things mean for us and for others right the way the politics is done is by shaping policy around what we would think it would be like to be another person we don't actually have to have experience that thing right you don't have to have actually experienced the Holocaust in order to think the Holocaust was bad you don't actually have to have experienced homophobia in order to think homophobia is bad you don't have to have experienced racism in order to think that racism is bad all right all of these things we can think about and come to moral conclusions about without actually having personally experienced them this is one of the reasons why I really dislike what Jimmy Kimmel does whenever he brings out his child to talk about healthcare policy so here's his unsuspecting kid as his unsuspecting kid had a second surgery last week I guess he has one more when he's age six and then he has done for life we can hope and pray so Kimmel brings out his kid to talk about the Children's Health Insurance Program so children's health insurance program is basically a supplemental health insurance program for kids who are poor and parents who cannot take care of those kids properly medically speaking it was sponsored originally by Orrin Hatch for public from Utah in the Senate in 1997 Republicans have been continuously funding it ever since so have Democrats and now there's a bit of a hold up in terms of final funding for the chip program but that is not because Republicans are uncaring or unfeeling yet that is what Kimmel says so Kimmel brings out his kids to talk about chip what does this kid have to do with chip the answer is nothing risky it has nothing to do with chip right his kid is not on chip the fact is the Jimmy Kimmel is a very very wealthy man he has health insurance I am sure through ABC but Jimmy Kimmel brings out his child and he starts talking about chip because for some reason the experience of his child connects with with chip in some way but you don't have to show me a sick child in order for you to make the case for chip whether it's good public policy or bad public policy but that's just with Jimmy Kimmel does so here is Jimmy Kimmel jumping right in and talking about Hawaii his son surgery links up to healthcare policy for poor people who are not him or something chip is the Children's Health Insurance Program it covers around it comes around nine million American kids whose parents make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but don't have access to coverage affordable coverage that are jobs which means it almost certainly covers children you know about one in eight children are covered only by chip and it's not controversial it's not a partisan thing fact the last time funding for chip was authorized was in 2015 it passed with a vote of 392 to 337 in the house and 92 to 8 in the Senate overwhelmingly Democrats and Republicans supported it until now now chip has become a bargaining chip it's on the back burner while they work out their new tax plans which means parents of children with cancer and diabetes and heart problems are about to get letters saying their coverage could be cut off next month Merry Christmas right oh those evil Republicans Merry Christmas on he talks about how tax cuts are the real problem with this right he says they let this money expire while they work on getting tax cut for their millionaire and billionaire donors okay so this is this is the shtick that Jimmy Kimmel is pushing right now by the way they so-called tax cuts for the millionaire and billionaire donors okay we talked yesterday about how the Senate botched the bill if you make over six hundred fifteen thousand dollars and you're self-employed and you have like a kid there's a good shot you're actually pay more taxes then you will makin money above a certain amounts of money if you live in a high tax state like California or New Jersey but Jimmy Kimmel doesn't note he's talking about and this is the problem right everyone is sitting here and the visuals matter so you're sitting here and you are watching his very cute child and that is a very cute child right it's an adorable kid and you feel terrible for that adorable kid as well you should write I know I've been in this situation I know what it's like to have an adorable child who's had to be cut open I get it okay but what he's saying is pure nonsense here okay what he is saying is not factually correct okay the House passed legislation last month to fund chip for five more years Democrats opposed it Democrats opposed it on the grounds they didn't like its funding mechanism it passed the house anyway the Senate Finance Committee passed a version of that bill too they haven't figured out the offsets from funding it why do they need the offsets from funding it they need the offsets from funding it because in order for them to pass it through the Senate without it being filibustered you have to show that it's not going to add to the deficit okay so the Senate already is considering pushing it President Trump last week last week signed funding for chip that will take it all the way through the end of January 31st funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that federal agency has been signing checks to States for the last two months chip is not going unfunded senator hatch again the original sponsor of the chip program has pushed forward the Kids Act reauthorizing chip for another five years as well Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday said quote we need to make sure the Children's Health Insurance Program which is expiring gets to panel before the end of the year sound that people are wasting time on tax cuts these two issues are completely disconnected the tax cuts have nothing to do with chip nothing but Kimmel is trying to promote a narrative that isn't even true and he's using his son to do it which is just yucky okay it's just gross the fact is again tax cuts have nothing these are two completely separate legislative efforts and not only are they completely separate legislative efforts what's hilarious about this is the Kimmel is saying that the Republicans are trying to hold up chip because they're trying to help out their millionaire and billionaire friends they're taking money from kids like Jimmy Kimmel Sonic's captive Jimmy Kimmel some rapport and they're trying to use that money to pay off all of these super wealthy people you know where the Republicans are trying to get the money to pay for chip you want know what they're trying get the money to pay for chip where the offsets are for high-income earners on Medicare in other words they're trying to get it from rich old people they're trying to take the money from rich old people and make sure young sick kids can get it and Jimmy Kimmel is sitting there ripping on the Republicans for it now again the point of this is that optics and politics means everything optics and politics is the whole shebang and the fact that he is willing to use his child for opticals for optics like this I find it really distasteful I think it's bad for the country I think again that it drives us to a place in politics where we can't have conversations with one another because if I say if I didn't have a kid who had a condition would I be able to critique Jimmy Kimmel when people pay attention to it or if I were just another conservative commentator if I revoke Roe right who's not even particularly concerned about all things healthcare let's say our avec Roy and I don't know I don't think I because he has had a kid with a condition like this but let's say that you're a full-on expert in healthcare this is what you did full-time right you worked over at Cato Institute or at Heritage Foundation and there's what you did full-time you don't have a sick kid we're not gonna pay as much attention to you as we do to Jimmy Kimmel because Jimmy Kimmel has a child who's who's playing with his thumb while he talks I hate this stuff more than I can tell you I think it's opportunistic I think Jimmy Kimmel is doing something morally bad here I think it is morally bad to use your child's condition as a as a lever in order to promote your favorite policies especially when your child's condition has nothing to do with those policies policy is about what's good for the bulk of the American people it is not about what sympathy level you can garner by bringing out a cute child or a cute puppy to me these this argument is no different than if Nancy Pelosi would start stumping for Obamacare and she'd bring out a cute puppy and Stroke it while she was talking and then every so often referenced the puppy again not because puppies and children are the same I'm violently against this notion right whenever people say that they have a dog and it's their four-legged child I just want to kind of kick them in the ass but what is it but is what is particularly ridiculous about this is again the notion that Jimmy Kimmel what he's saying is factually wrong but somehow it's given added credibility and if you look at the headlines today about Jimmy Kimmel I'm gonna tell you what some of the headlines say right on on various outlets so USA Today joined by his son Billy an emotional Jimmy Kimmel makes the case for chip TV when Jimmy Kimmel brings son to live for chip funding plea daily beats Jimmy Kimmel with son until delivery tear-filled tear-filled plea for health insurance Jimmy Kimmel and Billy blast Congress for holding chip hostage according to Deadline Jimmy Kimmel brings out his son to talk about how okay at any point in here would somebody like to point out the fact that everything Jimmy Kimmel says about this thing is actually not true like would that be useful at any point do you actually talk about the facts of the situation are we just gonna be bamboozled by the fact that he's bringing out a cute kid again I can bring out cute kids too I'm not sure you'd make the show more visually interesting if I were to have my son and daughter on my knees while I did it I just don't think that it adds the political points I'm making very much and I think it would be a cheap political trick we have known for years that politicians kissing babies is a cheap political trick it is no less cheap when a late night host brings out his own baby in order to push a message that has nothing to do with reality okay so meanwhile today is the big day in Alabama voters are heading to the polls to choose between a pro-abortion fanatic Tom Jones and an alleged child molester Roy Moore so all the best of America on display in Alabama today Roy Moore apparently rode up to the polls on a horse because we just have to signal the cowboy and vest and cowboy hat I really want someone to go back and score in the score from gunfight at the OK Corral with Kirk Douglas I think it'd just be great okay Corral like we met we may as well just go full-on here and the closing pitch for more was interesting to say the least Steve banned and made the closing pitch for Roy Moore he ripped into Joe Scarborough he mocked joe scarborough's college education he apparently said that he got into better schools than joe could have Georgetown and Harvard there's only one problem with this line of attack Joe Scarborough won to wait for it University of Alabama yeah so then I love Steve Benton jet-setting in from Los Angeles I think the schmucky is jet-setting in from Los Angeles outsiders could not have any impact on this race Steve Bannon from Harvard Business School and Los Angeles and Goldman Sachs and Joe Scarborough cannot listen I'm not a huge Joe Scarborough fan I've hit Joe on this program a number of times but I'm Jones to the University of Alabama dude and then another speaker at the at the more of an troll told a story that was supposed to show how moral Roy Moore was it was weird it was weird the story is here it's the echos pretty bad here one of Romans old Vietnam buddy says that when they were in Vietnam together they somehow stumbled into a brothel they're a bunch of underage girls there and Roy Moore too said let's get out of here and this is the exonerating tale for Roy Moore first of all I would just say that I wasn't in Vietnam so I don't know how often you just sort of stumbled into a brothel but beyond that weird story weird story and then it got weirder so I'm gonna play you audio of Roy Moore's wife who is trying to rebut allegations that Moore is an sematic I'm not sure who made the allegations that Moore's anti-semitic because I haven't seen a lot of rationale for that allegation the only odd semantic thing I saw in this Alabama race was the attempt by somebody who's allied with more I guess to put out robo calls suggesting that there was a Jewish Washington Post reporter Bernie Bernstein who is calling around and trying to pay people to tell tales about Roy Moore that was pretty bad but I'm gonna play you another weird piece of audio we basically entered the twilight zone in this race and thankfully it's gonna come to an end by tonight we'll find out whether Moore is the senator or whether he's not first I want to say thank you to our sponsor is over at legacy box so the holidays are upon you if you want to make you want to get a fantastic gift for your parents

the slash pen so they know that we sent you okay so this was the clip that had the media agog last night Roy Moore's wife Caleb she was trying to her about allegations that were way more was an anti-semite again I'm not sure who made those allegations I guess there were some people who had made those allegations with regard to something having to do with George Soros he made a comment about George Soros going to hell which may very well happen I'm not sure what that had to do with Soros being Jewish per se Soros is not exactly an Orthodox Jew in any case here is Kayla Moore making a very weird reference might tell you all this because I've seen the record straight while they're here one of our attorneys is a Jew and she smiles and she looks into the camera and you kind of nods okay she should have started with that one right we have close friends who are rabbis and Jewish then we fellowship with them that would be the best place to start not we have a lawyer who's a Jew yeah welcome to America okay everyone has a lawyer who's a Jew or an accountant or a doctor right it turns it like not not a particularly strong defense there but this entire race has been weird doesn't mean they're anti-semitic no everybody who's going off on that last night on Twitter you're just being silly okay Kayla Moore may have gotten that out of order maybe she shouldn't have said her lawyer was a Jew as a defense because it's dumb defense and anti-semitism if it in fact existed but putting all of that aside no I don't think that there's a lot of proof that Moore is anti-semitic I think there are plenty of other reasons not to vote for Roy Moore among them credible allegations of child molestation but now we are down to the wire in Alabama President Trump he's really ramping up his support for Roy Moore he's attempting to get Roy Moore over the finish line if Roy Moore were to lose after Trump has signed off on this it would be pretty devastating to Trump particularly would show that he doesn't have a lot of coattails it would show that he probably should have stayed out of it in the first place like this was actually a safe position for him if he had just stayed out of it there's a good case to be made that he is safest politically what Trump is safest politically if he stays out of this now for Roy Moore wins then Trump gets to own Roy Moore so I'm not sure that's much of a booby prize I mean what a parting gift that is right you win and now you are stapled to the guy who's probably gonna be put up before a Senate Ethics Committee investigation for possible child molestation when is a younger man none of this is good either way this goes bad for Republicans if you have more wins Republicans gets Hanser questions about Roy Moore until the end of time and Roy Moore is not a guy whose mouth shut he's gonna say a lot of dumb stuff if we're more losses then Republicans lose the seat to Doug Jones so well done primary voters and well done Roy Moore who wouldn't step out in the first place it does show you shamelessness will get you everywhere in politics if he had any sense of shame he would have stepped out during this election cycle he has none and that benefits politicians I will say it benefits politicians not to have any serious sense of shame okay so now I want to turn to the Democrat attempts to oust president Trump so they've used the Al Franken quasi resignation Franken still hasn't set a date for leaving they've used this as an excuse to go after president Trump they're using the the sexual allegations against remor as a lever to go up against President Trump now all the Democrats are saying that President Trump should step down and yesterday I talked sort of briefly about whether Trump should quote-unquote resign over allegations of sexual abuse and this brought me I was trying to think about this in a more systematic way last night I was trying to figure out you know when should politicians in general resign and it seems to me that there are five different options as to when politicians should resign this is not when politicians do resign this is when politicians could or should resign so answer number one is never politicians should never resign unless they are dragged away in Chains they should never resign they were elected by the people there's no excuse for them resigning unless there is due process and they're convicted in a court of law they should never ever ever resign this seems to be the way that Roy Moore is going about it or Trump or Bill Clinton or most politicians who have a generalized lack of shame is the way that they deal with allegations is simple by saying listen there's no bid no due process I deny the allegations utterly I'm not leaving right this is actually in some ways the most clear-cut standard that we're never gonna pressure a politician to resign or that a politician shouldn't resign unless the politician has actually been convicted of a crime and this makes a certain amount of sense but it means that you're gonna have to say the Democrats it's okay for Bob Menendez to sit in the Senate in the same way it's fine for Roy Moore to sit in the Senate okay option number two is you're only supposed to resign when you're about to be convicted of something so we're in the final stages there's been a criminal prosecution Bob Menendez is on trial is he gonna be convicted or not he should resign now because it's not good for convicted felons to be sitting in the United States Senate even for five minutes as standard number two so in this case Roy Moore there's been no prosecution against him it's he's not about to be convicted of anything sort of the Richard Nixon strategy is about to be impeached or convicted so now it is time for him to and now it's time for him to step down that's standard number two and again relatively clear-cut standard but most politicians are not gonna hold by it number three is before an election so bad allegations come out before an election sure the politicians step down typically politicians have the reason the politicians typically have is because politicians don't want to sell you their party with the allegations but again if you have no shame then you stick around so that's that standard number three before an election you step down because you don't want to force the voters to choose between somebody about whom there are credible allegations of bad behavior and somebody who does not have those allegations but whom you disagree with you want to avoid the more Jones race more should have stepped down earlier in this race option number four is when new information arises about something horrible you did post elections this is the Al Franken scenario so nobody knew about this stuff that Al Franken's it before the election and when he was elected in in 2010 or 2012 rather and when Al Franken let's see Franklin was 2010 I believe so yeah it's when when he was first elected in that special election these allegations were not out the allegations came out afterward new information means he should re-evaluate himself and he should resign and then finally there's the only standard by which Democrats could credibly argue the Trump should step down and that is when he's done something horrible at all so we find out that 30 years ago now we find out we knew that 30 years ago you did really bad stuff and we knew that during the election cycle but now we're gonna call on you to resign visit the reason I'm making these distinctions is because I was trying last night to figure out what's the difference between Al Franken and Trump now the easy answer is there is no difference between Al Franken and Trump but I don't think that's exactly correct there may be very little difference in the allegations but there is a difference in the timing all of the allegations about Trump came out before November Trump was then greenlit by the American people now could there be an impeachment over this sort of activity sure he could have an impeachment over anything it's a political crime but the idea that you're gonna treat pressure to push Trump to resign in the same way you treat Franken is weird considering that the American people knew about every single allegation that's currently being aired about Trump before the election cycle and they greenlit him that's a different thing than Franken resigning because none of his voters knew about any of these allegations when they agree and let him new evidence means that Franken could step down and spare his party the the heartache of running for re-election we already know what Trump is we already know what the allegations against Trump were so mumping in Trump and Franken together I think is logically incorrect so before I go any further here I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at MVM tea so I can attest to the quality of MVM tea watches first of all they look great so here is my new

democrats have turned to the sexual harassment allegations with regard to president Trump specifically because they are I think trying to move away from the allegations with regard to Russia those are panning out into nothing I mean those have really turned into just a big nothing Victor Davis Hanson has a very good piece over at National Review now Hansen is much more of a supporter of President Trump than I am obviously but he has a very good rundown about all the problems with special councilor Muller's investigation he talks about all of the various members of the investigation who have been in weird positions he starts with the Comey the James Comey subordinate Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe around the Washington DC office that was involved in the Clinton email investigations he did not recuse himself from the email investigations until one week before the presidential election even though his wife was running for a Democrat Senate seat in Virginia and seems a huge donation of almost $700,000 from the Clinton organization basically and then it turns out that at least six of Moeller staff of 15 lawyers had given to Hillary Clinton okay you know that's not dispositive a lot of people did get money to Hillary Clinton but then there's Peter stroszek I don't go to Peter stroke right an FBI investigator assigned to the Muller investigation with of Russian collusion according to Victor Davis Hanson stroke and Lisa page a consulting FBI lawyer or for some reason relieved from the investigation of Trump in late summer 2017 Muller's office refused to explain the departure of either other than to let the media assume that the departures were unrelated and due to normal revolving or transient appointments okay and then we learned that they were having an extramarital affair and had been sending anti-trump text messages and then we found out that Andrew Weissman who is another veteran prosecutor who's been assigned to Muller's legal team praise Sally Yates you remember Sally Yates she was the administration holdover the Obama holdover from the DOJ who'd broken her oath of office and refused to carry out Trump's administra immigration order and Andrew Weissman who's been working on the mobile legal team he wrote to Sally Yates I'm so proud and in awe and that came out and then we found out another attorney on the mother staff Jeanne Reed was at one time the personal attorney for Ben Rhodes the fiction writer turned Obama national security adviser who's a garbage heap of a human being when it comes to his policy and his political opinions and then it turns out so I mean the list goes on and on that a senior Justice Department official bruised or connected with various ongoing investigations under the aegis of the Justice Department and was reassigned for his contact with the opposition research firm responsible for the Clinton funded anti-trump dossier which in theory could have been the catalyst for the original investigation of collusion by the FBI it turns out that his wife Nellie or whose experiences Russian politics and history actually worked for fusion GPS during the 2016 campaign her husband was working apparently on the Russia investigation and then we found out that there's a guy named Aaron Zeb Lee who served as Muller's chief of staff while at the FBI and was assigned to the FBI's counterterrorism division in the National Security Division at the DOJ and he served as assistant US attorney in the national security and terrorism unit in Virginia but he represented a guy named Justin Cooper who is the IT staffer who set up Hillary's illegal and unsecure server at her home so basically half the people who are involved the mobile investigation have been compromised in some way or another by connections with Hillary Clinton or opposition to President Trump this is bad stuff right this is bad stuff and it's one of the reasons why President Trump is now being rumored to be thinking of opening up a special counsel investigation into the Special Counsel investigation that's how far we've gone so we are now at the point where it's like dr. Seuss you know the places you'll go there's a bee watcher and then you he's not doing his job so you have the bee watcher watcher who watches the bee watcher but it turns out he's lazy toys you have the bee watcher watcher until the entire town of hototc is on a bee watcher watch her and watch her and watch right then that's basically we're gonna have special investigations with a special investigator all the way down the line Turtles all the way down very exciting stuff I can't believe the Moller botched the investigation as badly or maybe I can maybe I can but that's the reason why Democrats are now turning to the sexual accusations about President Trump the reason that they are doing so is because obviously they think the Russian investigation is beginning to fall apart it's the reason why Kristen Gillibrand is going after Trump Trump by the way fighting back against Kirsten Gillibrand today I don't know this is one of those cases again where I just wish Trump would shut the hell up on Twitter it's so stupid what he's doing Kirsten Gillibrand is going after him for all of the for all of the sexual harassment allegations from last year remember Kirsten Gillibrand was best friends with the Clintons until five minutes ago when she decided it would be more useful to throw their bodies under the bus Kirsten Gillibrand received money from from Trump when Trump was just a big Democrat donor and now Kristin Gillibrand was ripping on Trump and she says that we need to investigate Trump here's what she had to say and an unprecedented time in American politics and the world is gripped by this saga I mean here it now takes aimed squarely at president Trump as this whole me - movement you know gains momentum should he shred the White House be worried well president Trump should resign these allegations are credible they are numerous I've heard these women's testimony and many of them are heartbreaking and President Trump should resign his position okay so she says that there should be a full investigation so Trump tweets back at her and here's what Trump tweets is 18 so Trump Trump goes directly at her lightweight senator Kirsten Gillibrand so it late as one of his favorite again Trump only has a lexicon of about seven insults and he just rotates them so it's lightweight senator Kirsten Gillibrand a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who could come to my office begging again in scare quotes for no reason for campaign contributions not so long ago and would do anything for them is now in ring fighting against Trump very disloyal to Bill and crooked you sed I don't know used okay I thought those yes for a second I thought that was the US Department of Education that used because of the random random capitals all of this the sin tab put in putting the crazy syntax of the sweet Assad and the fact that it's barely written in English the fact that he's going after Kirsten Gillibrand is very stupid okay the reason that it's stupid is because why would you possibly raise her profile this way Kristen Gillibrand wants to run for president in 2020 this is an in-kind contribution to senator Kirsten Gillibrand she could not hope for a better she of course comes out and strikes back at trump and suggests that President Trump is bullying her and then this is what drives me not the entire media suggests that Trump sexually harassed Kirsten Gillibrand in this tweet guys that's not what sexual harassment means being mean to a woman online is not sexual harassment sexual harassment is acting in a sexually inappropriate way toward a woman saying that she's dumb or that she's corrupt that is not a thing president Trump says that about everyone like there there are five people left in the United States he hasn't said that about most of them work for the administration the idea that the maybe I mean he's head said half of his administration is dumb in corrupt like I don't understand why this even comes close to looking like sexual harassment in any real way but the President of the United States is lifting Kirsten Gillibrand profile Elizabeth Warren who again a highly overrated intellect I love the fact that Elizabeth Warren then tweeted out that Trump had slut-shamed her in the suite she tweeted are you really trying to bully intimidate and slut shame senator you're senator gillibrand do you know who you're picking a fight with good luck with that President Trump nevertheless hashtags she persisted oh my god all these people need to go away just go away is it Christmas yet can we just take the time off like please Elizabeth Warren its Foca hunt is right now poke on Foca honza's photo honza's where exactly did Trump slut-shame senator gillibrand there does she even know it slut shame slut-shaming is to say to a woman that she is somehow morally less because she sexually promiscuous there's always a weird insult in in my and it was always a weird critique in my view today quote-unquote slut-shaming somebody I wasn't aware that being more of that being sexually promiscuous was it was a net positive but in any case this is now that the line the Democrats are going to use that Trump is sexually harassing kirsten gillibrand oh the level of stupid oh the in the same level of insane stupid and Trump didn't need to get into this it's a waste of time you should have just ignored it it was gonna go away everybody was gonna know that this was driven by politics more than it was by policy or by reality but that's the way that it goes okay so before I go any further I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Dollar Shave Club so you've heard me talk about the terrific shave I get right here under my chinny chin chin according to Jewish law for my Dollar Shave Club razor especially when I use it with the dr.

check it out at dollarshaveclub.com slash bend that's dollarshaveclub.com slash been okay so III do have to I do have to tell you about this insane piece from everyday just because it is HIGHlarious okay so this piece from everyday feminism discusses what intersectional feminist are looking for in a date it is not a wonder that they are miserable people intersectional feminist because these are questions they're ten questions you are supposed to ask your date if you're an intersectional feminist the following list of questions writes who wrote this letter awit I'm not going to assume his/her gender I'm not going to assume gender because we're not allowed to do that at everyday feminism the greatest site on the internet but here is what Laura writes the following list of questions is applicable to all relationships certainly not just cisgender heterosexual ones one do you believe the black lives matter well there's a hell of an opener you sit down for a date and before you even start talking the woman says to you do you believe that black lives matter like how are you supposed to answer that what happens you say no I mean like what first of all like does anyone the United States say no to that question of course everyone believes black lives matter the question is whether you think the movement is actually worthwhile or whether it is a vast misinterpretation of variable data on police activity but never mind all that it's just then what are your thoughts on gender and sexual orientation I love this the gender binary is a tiny box I wish it didn't exist but it does I wouldn't want to be with anyone who's queer phobic is that your that that's like your opener then that's it that's another one your opening questions is like you're a straight woman and you're dating a straight guy and your first question is would you have sex with the dude or are you queer phobic like are you do you believe that I'm a woman okay how do you work to dismantle sexism and misogyny in your life what are you talking about to me I'm just a plumber like what are you like what does I met cisgender heterosexual I'm not having there toxic masculinity questions are threatened in any way and they love us as a monolith they love a women have to offer whether it's sex food love care emotional labor they love us for what we can do for them not because of who we are for ourselves well I feel like this is sort of a weird arbitrary boundary that you're drawing here it seems to me that what you are is very much related to what you do so that's the that's sort of a weird take on things what are your thought on sex work like that this one my favorites what are your thoughts on sex work really the sectional feminists want you to ask your your date what your thoughts are on prostitution hint to the ladies if you say to a man what are your thoughts on prostitution the guys like love it all for it it shouldn't date him it's gonna go badly but apparently this is a question to ask when you're dating because because being pro sex worker is a necessary pillar for dismantling the patriarchy there's nothing that dismantles the patriarchy like making it more available for scummy men's and have sex for money no nothing dismantles the patriarchy just like that which is why when you watch old westerns everyone goes to the whorehouse because they're all trying to dismantle the patriarchy it's a thing are you a supporter of the BDS movement perfectly I love this I love this it's just great that on your first date you should ask whether you hate Jews and wants to divest from Israel what is your understanding of settler colonialism and indigenous rights Wow do you think capitalism is exploitative first of all I would say yes to that question just so that I could avoid actually having to pay for dinner I would say capitalism is exploitative so let's let's break the check can any human be illegal do you support Muslim Americans and non-muslim people from Islamic countries and does your ally Shipp include disabled folks if a woman asked me any of these questions run as fast as you possibly can because that's horrifying that'll be the worst marriage ever but I guess marriage is to shed anyway so who cares all right so before we go any further here and there is much more to come I first have to say that you need to go over and subscribe

some Beethoven so I I said yesterday I'd read a Beethoven biography over the weekend really enjoyed the biography and now I want to play for you a little bit of Beethoven music that you may not know it's sort of off the beaten track a little bit so the only ones that everybody knows are v his symphony and his ninth symphony some people know the sixth symphony from Fantasia but there's a lot of Beethoven music that people have missed because they just don't follow it that closely so Beethoven's opus 130 is one of his string quartets and there's a movement called the Cavatina in the middle of the string quartet it is so well known to sort of as feats that it was actually placed on the permanent disc that was sent with the Stars with the with the the Voyager the the starship Voyager the shuttle that we sent out into deep space that we sent out a CD on that on that shuttle it's actually a golden record so in case the aliens find it and they want to know what kind of music we listen to we put on some crap and then we put on some good stuff so the good stuff is Beethoven and Mozart and Bach and this Cavatina from his string quartet is is part of it the part that I've pulled here is not actually the most melodic part but it is one of the most heartbreaking parts in music it's what happened is that Beethoven was suffering with his nephew he his life was really difficult Beethoven and he had a big fight with his brother died his brother's wife was a national convicted criminal and he seized the son away from his his sister-in-law and he had the court actually relocate the son with him and so his nephew was sort of his surrogate son it wasn't particularly good father and his surrogate son had all sorts of trouble and in the middle of that trouble he wrote the string quartet and there is a part where he actually writes in the he actually writes in the notes well it would be verklempt in in yiddish but it's I'm very member what it is in German it's it's I'll look up the word in a second but in any case the point here is that the violin is supposed to sound like it's actually crying and it's a good imitation of musical crying as hell over here here it is the Cavatina one of from Beethoven's opus 130 so then it goes into back into the regular thing we should listen the entire movement it really is beautiful that that portion they're supposed to be the sort of person sobbing struggling to catch their breath it's the only thing that Beethoven wrote where he said he cried when he wrote it it is his glorious music Beethoven is just spectacular a lot of its late music is so complex the grossa fugue which I may or may not play on the program it's it's so complex that I don't understand it properly I really want to know some more music theory before analyzing it it was so complex that it's time people called it repellent he actually lose the it was the last movement of this particular string quartet I believe and he removed it from this string quartet because people didn't understand it hundred years later people were still calling in modern music because it was so sophisticated in the way that he'd written it okay time for it some other things I like so I have to give Sarah Huckabee Sanders some credit the press went after her yesterday and she went directly back at them over inaccuracies in their reporting and I'm on Sarah Huckabee Sanders aside here here is what the press secretary had to say mistakes they should own up to them sometimes a lot of times you don't there's a very big difference between making honest mistakes and purposefully misleading the American people something that happens regularly you can't say I'm not done well you cannot say that it's an honest mistake when you're purposely putting out information that you know to be false or when you're taking information that hasn't been validated that hasn't been offered any credibility and that has been continually denied by a number of people including people with direct knowledge of an instance this is something that I'm speaking about the number of reports that have taken place a couple of weeks I'm simply stating that there should be a certain level of responsibility in thank you really show acts acosta as well she should Acosta is one of the most repellant reporters working at the White House okay time for one thing I hate and then we will get to a quick deconstructing the culture so so here is today's thing I hate so my wife and I were bored the other night and we decided to grab a movie from Netflix and to chill as they say as the children say and and the movie that we grabbed we had not seen in the theaters it was guardians of the galaxy - volume 2 volume 2 guardians of the galaxy vol 2 this movie is hot garbage this movie is just terrible which makes me sad I liked guardians of the galaxy one it is a bad movie okay it's not just a bad movie it's atrociously insultingly bad this movie got 83 percent on Rotten Tomatoes which demonstrates - you do not trust the critics when it comes to comic book movies trust me and I never say - trust me on things trust me when it comes to comic book movies my taste is significantly better than the average critic on Rotten Tomatoes who don't what the hell they're talking about this movie is no better than Justice League in fact in significant ways actually worse than Justice League at least Justice League has a couple of memorable scenes there is nothing remotely memorable about this film they somehow blow having Kurt Russell in the film which is just ridiculous I don't know how you blow having Kurt Russell in the film Kurt Russell is great in everything go watch tombstone instead of watching this you'll enjoy it much better it's a bunch of CGI nonsense the only thing that's even mildly interesting or funny is David Bautista he's a who is actually turning out to be quite a screen presence he's the only thing in the film that's that's even remotely worth seeing the rest of the film is just awful Bradley Cooper's part is garbage the Chris Pratt turns into a nonentity in this movie the CGI is unwatchable it'll give you a headache I can't express to you how much I just liked this movie so here's a bit of the preview so you too can see how it'll show you sort of how you can turn a really bad movie into an okay trailer because that's basically the message of this of this particular segment the fate of the universe lies in your shoulders now whatever you do don't push this button because that will set off the bomb immediately and we'll all be dead now repeat back what I just said okay so this is the whole movie and it's it's this is every funny bit in the movie in the first 30 seconds of this trailer it's just and and I'm sorry baby Groot is just such a pandering play and say oh well you need something to sell at the CBS for a Christmas so baby Groot yeah okay do not watch this film if you have watched this film see if you can get a refund if you can't get a refund see if you can invent a time machine and go back and take the two hours of your time back and if you can't let me know because I want it back okay I'm gonna deconstruct the culture here very briefly so I'm going to spoil two things that are currently in theaters and/or on Netflix so if you don't like spoilers then this is the part between out for the show and you come back tomorrow so here is the here are the two things that I'm gonna spoil I'm gonna spoil not really but a little bit I'm gonna spoil godless on Netflix and I'm gonna spoil mud bound which is also available on Netflix and in theaters right now because they both make the same plot mistake and it drives me up a wall so to introduce why this is a mistake I want to show you the scene from the classic Western Shane so Shane if you haven't seen it one of the great westerns of all time just terrific Alan Ladd Van Heflin Jean Arthur and the whole point here is that Ellen Ladd is sort of a wandering gunfighter it's basically the same plot is godless he's basically a wandering gunfighter who stumbles into a town that's being dominated by bad people and he is signed on as sort of a farmhand at Van Heflin farm Van Heflin and Jean Arthur are married they have a child ran into wilds my believe won an honorary Oscar for this film and they and an Alan Ladd sort of becomes the boys hero he sort of becomes the boys hair even though the father is a good guy and the mother starts falling in love with Alan Ladd and that's the whole theme of the film the whole theme of the film is Duty outweighing your necessity to have feelings basically hey you're you have duties to do good things even when your feelings would drive you in the other direction it's a really good film it's it's a little bit long but it holds up so here is a scene in which you will see Jean Arthur who plays the wife she Alan Ladd has just gotten in a fight she at both Alan Ladd and Van Heflin have gotten in a fight over at the dry goods store with some of the bad guys and she is talking to Ellen lad and and you can see she's falling in love with Alan Ladd and her husband Van Heflin is sort of watching this happen yeah it needs a bandage it's good enough Miriam it's fine thanks very much wanna know something mother what is it do you I love them almost as much as I love pop that's alright isn't it he's a fine man he's so good yes I like him too Jerry people can't see Alan Ladd walks out of the room and Jean Arthur comes out of her kids room and she opens the door and she's looking out after Shane and then then half when her husband opens the door okay so this is called subtlety okay this is a thing that was completely now lacked in movies it's so good right I mean it's so good in the subtlety of it right you know that she you know that she has a thing for Alan Ladd you know Alan Ladd has a thing for her and that he's and that he's walking out because he wants to preserve the family and protect the family the reason he leaves at the end is because he wants to protect the family he's already saved helped save the town he's already helped clean in the town and now he has to leave and the boy doesn't understand it it's heartbreaking and it's wonderful at the same time it's such a good film okay now here's where I'm gonna spoil a little thing about godless soin godless basically there's a town of women and the and all the men in the town of died in a mining accident there's on the first five minutes of the show and a character exactly like Alan Ladd comes to town right he you don't know his background you know that he was sort of a criminal but he comes to town and he gets involved with Michelle Dockery who you'll remember from Downton Abbey and she had she also has a son and in exactly the same way I mean it's exactly the same plot okay to rip off and the an ROI comes in and he's training the kid he's training the kid to you know ride a horse and he's training the kid how to had a farm better and all this kind of stuff and meanwhile the mother is sort of falling in love with him now she's not married right Michelle jaakor he's not married but it's pretty clear that there's another guy in the town who has a crush on her and he's also a good guy right he's a sheriff he's going blind and he it turns out that that he has known for a while and I won't spoil that part of it but in any case and one of the things that ends up happening is that very much near the end of the show near the end of the show she goes into the barn and they have sex okay this is paralleled in in the in this movie mud bound in the movie mud bound basically as I talked about on the show Carey Mulligan is a woman who's living with her husband in the down-home south and her husband is kind of a slob they have a couple of kids and her husband's brother is the sort of romantic pilot figure who has PTSD he comes back to town and the two brothers go up against one another because one of them's racist in one of them isn't basically and near the end of that movie she has sex with the brother in both cases let's just say that they end very similarly to Shane okay in both cases the you know the people don't end up together right the people have sex don't end up together and the reason that this drives me up a wall is because of both of those films would have been better with a little more subtlety you actually end up destroying the character of the man by having him have sex with the woman in those films but our modern society cannot take the idea of two people being in sexual tension without there being consummation I can't take that idea right that was the entire idea of human virtue was the idea that you can be tempted to do something and you should not do it because it's immoral and what makes you a good person is with what withstanding the temptation to do things that are immoral that's what makes you a better person not not consummating it and it's a throwaway once you consummate it okay the fact is that the godless would have been significantly better if we never consummate swith with the with the with this woman because then it's he comes in he helps the son and you know that he wants to get together with her but he also is not willing to stick around and it's not kind to the woman and it's not good for him for him to consummate this relationship and then leave her to this other guy like it's bad right that's that's why Alan Ladd leaves he leaves in shame because he wants this family to be together because it's important for the family to be together in in godless it's exactly I mean it is down to the note exactly the same plot and yet the guy sleeps with the girl and it ruins it it's not good it's not smart and it's bad and it says something about modern society and the same thing is true in my band the exact they're trying to make a hero out of the pilot who stands up against racism as they haven't sleep with his brother's wife one time and then leave what the hell is the point of that why would you do that it's only because we as a society have decided that self control is no longer a virtue self-control is no longer something worth prising and then you wonder what about you know harassment of women you seriously age a society that does not prize and treasure and cherish and burnish self-control is a society that incentivizes men not to take part in it the ethics of shame are much better than the ethics of godless and they're much better than the ethics of mud bound and it's also a better movie it's better art because it's more true to what a good man does a good man withholds his own feelings when it means damaging other people okay we'll be back here tomorrow with the results of the big election in Alabama which I'm sure will be fascinating talk no matter which way it goes I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive
