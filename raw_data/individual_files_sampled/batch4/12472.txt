oddly unnoticed by the mainstream media that of course is the arrest of a alt-right far-right activist named Tommy Robinson who is reportedly jailed after filming outside of a child grooming trial in Britain so Tommy Robinson's very controversial figure it's hard to figure out exactly where he stands he's sort of on the fringes of the right he was the X founder of the English Defence League he's been arrested in the past for some violent run-ins with with the police he's been at rallies that involve anti-semites but now he is pro-israel so he's sort of all over the place a little bit and he's made some comments that are actually particularly egregious in the past he's blamed all Muslims for terrorists for terrorist attacks etc but one thing that he's been doing lately is backed off of some of those comments and one thing he's been doing lately is he's been going outside of these grooming trials in Britain so for people who haven't been following this there's been a series of scandals in Britain where it turns out that there were Muslim men radical Muslims religious Muslims who were who were apparently grooming young children to be essentially gang raped in a couple of locations in Britain and these were largely covered up by the local police we've talked about a little bit on the show before they were covered up by local police or at least they weren't fully investigated by local police the press refused to cover them because they were afraid of the anti Islamic backlash they were afraid would ensue well here is what happened this guy Tommy Robinson who again is a kooky fellow he sort of milo gianopolous Lite he was arrested and reportedly jailed on Friday after he filmed members of an alleged child grooming gang entering a court for trial so he was standing outside he was filming them apparently in Britain you're not allowed to do this because they are afraid that it will bias the jurors if you actually film people outside so here is video of him being arrested for literally standing outside of a court and holding a cell phone in fact someone later handed us on the outside me about my mother and Here I am being arrested for say nothing so the judges in the past have arrested him before he was arrested hanging a year ago in a similar case where he was filming outside of a courthouse in Leeds he apparently went into the courthouse in this case he didn't go inside the courthouse the judge in that case said that Tommy Robinson could have been responsible for biasing the jurors now think about this from an American perspective the press are constantly going to courthouses and filming outside courthouses as defendants walk in there were all sorts of pictures just last week of Harvey Weinstein walking into a police station being arrested walking out there was no suggestion that all of the media who are reporting Harvey Weinstein's arrest were somehow contributing to an atmosphere of say anti-semitism why because that's idiotic it's insane to say that you can't report on trials it's ridiculous to suggest you can't say things that obviously are public import in matters concern in some cases what appears to be a guarded culture of the police protecting certain people in order to prevent Islamophobia or whatever this is well here is what gets even crazier about the story so Tommy Robinson is arrested and then an order comes down from the court it's now been reversed but the original order from the court was you were not allowed to report on Tommy Robinson's arrest because if you reported on Tommy Robinson's arrest then you'd be biasing the jurors in his case ok well this doesn't sound like V for Vendetta kind of stuff I don't know what does this sort of weirdly dystopian nonsense where you can't report on a trial because it involves radical Muslims who are allegedly raping children and then if you do report and you are arrested then we can't report on your arrest because then that might bias the jurors in your case so according to a source to talk to Fox News they say the time Robinson was jailed in hoe prison the prison declined to comment to Fox News on whether Robinson was there Leeds Crown Court also did not return a quest for information according to the independent Robinson was already on a suspended sentence for contempt of court over a gang rape case in 2017 the judge in the case on Friday slapped a reporting ban on the case again this is something that only happens in Britain we don't have this sort of thing in the United States there bans on having reporters inside courtrooms sometimes sometimes they won't allow cameras in the courtroom but there is no idea that you can't report on a case okay in the United States everyone can report on a case so long as the courtroom isn't closed and you can report what's going on outside the courtroom well the judge in the case slapped a reporting ban on the case the order bans reporters from reporting on a case if there is reason to believe the reporting could prejudice a trial there's had a vague and insane that standard is that if you believe the reporting could prejudice a trial you can't report on it every report could possibly affect a trial every single report and you report about anything going on in the world could theoretically impact a trial it's one of the reasons why in the United States we often have jury sequestration were in the OJ case for example you put up people at a particular hotel and then you cut out the cable so that's presumably they're not supposed to get any sort of information from the outside I have serious questions as to whether even that is constitutional but at least in the United States there's no ban on the reporting there are restrictions on the jurors as to what they can see but it isn't that CNN or MSNBC or Fox News can't report on a given trial that's insane so what happened a bunch of news outlets in the UK removed their reporting from their websites to comply with the gag order most remaining reporting in the UK comments Robinson's arrest but not on his purported sentencing sources with knowledge of Robinson's case spoke on condition of anonymity in part because if you're that they would then be arrested for contempt well remember this is the country of Magna Carta this is the country of Edmund Burke this is the country of John Locke is the country where Liberty of speech where Liberty of thought was born and now we were being told he can't even report on cases in Britain if it should by his people if it should bias the jurors one of these sources told Fox that Tommy Robinson's lawyer warned that considering the presence of Muslim gang members in prison a 13-month sentence was tantamount to a death sentence Tommy's lawyer said he will likely die in jail given his profile on previous credible threats the judge basically said he doesn't care the source said he sentenced him to 13 months in prison but we don't have that confirmed but there's no way to confirm it because we can't report on it so who knows what's been said at this point it is certainly true that Tommy Robinson has had run-ins with Muslims before he was jailed for a for a brief period of time a few years back and he lost all of his front teeth in a brawl apparently allegedly with some Muslim prisoners hey so it's good to know that Britain is really concerned with the values that bore Britain rather the the fascists and the fascism that that Britain fought for decades it hasn't won in any way it's just that Britain has now voluntarily condemning its own citizens to be jailed for reporting on cases and if your report on the report then all of a sudden you're in even more trouble but here's the good news the good news is that Britain really has its priorities straight because at the same time they're preventing Tommy Robinson from actually reporting on these cases and then preventing people from reporting on the table in Robinson case at least Ireland has voted to go full ahead with with allowing abortion up to the 20th week so there was a a massive there was a massive referendum passed two to one in Ireland to get rid of the country's abortion ban so they had a ban on abortion that went all the way back to inception because there was a right to life to consumption there was a right to life in the Irish Constitution right said I think it was section 8 article 8 of the of the Irish Constitution that says that there's a right to life that extends to the unborn well that was done away with over the weekend in a massive procession the the Irish people came out and they stood in front of that they stood in front of the Prime Minister's office and here's a picture of the prime minister of Ireland celebrating along with these thousands of people out there in the street it's just supposed to be amazing he tweeted it out and and what he said was that this was just an incredible crowd he took our fantastic crowds at Dublin Castle a remarkable day a quiet revolution has taken place a great act of democracy so let's be straight about this the great act of democracy is allowing the unborn to be killed in the womb the great act of democracy is not protecting people reporting on trials okay this is not this is the end of Western civilization I mean this really is the suicide the slow suicide of Western civilization Western civilization European civilization the land on which individual rights were born okay those are those rights are now being killed piece by piece they're being destroyed piece by piece they're being carved up and buried piece by piece you may not like Tommy Robinson you may think he's a schmuck I think he sort of is but that doesn't make a difference what the time he Robinson case shows you is that Europe's idea of its own rights they've been completely overturned they've been completely overthrown instead it's tolerance and multiculturalism and diversity that matters it's protection of feelings not protection of rights the unborn they can be killed on mass and you will have hundreds of thousands of people in the streets celebrating but if a guy gets arrested for covering a trial there's only a couple of hundred protesters outside Parliament yeah that says something about the state of Western civilization and it's not pretty in other good news at least the EU is proposing banning all sorts of plastic products that's also deeply important the EU has proposed banning plastic products like comment and the cotton buds straws stirs and balloon sticks when alternatives are easily available in an attempt to reduce litter spoiling beaches and ocean beds the European Commission said its proposal would seek to cut marine litter in half of the ten for the ten most prominent items and avoid environmental damage estimated at over 250 billion dollars over the next dozen years so it's good the EU is right on top of the stuff the EU can't prevent mass Muslim migration from the Middle East unvetted they can't prevent that but they can't prevent you from using a drinking straw so we know that their priorities are definitely on or over in Europe there's nothing to worry about it's amazing Europe has seen this upswing and this real upsurge in right-wing sentiments and it's reflected as this ultra nationalist sentiment is a sentiment that makes me deeply uncomfortable right you're seeing a lot of far-right parties in places like Poland and Hungary that are suddenly beginning to see all sorts of support you're seeing it in Britain as well that is a reaction it is a reaction you don't like it I don't like it a lot of people don't like it but to pretend that it is not a reaction to a left that is gone completely overboard in favor of transnational institutions destroying individual rights is to pretend that what is happening is not happening okay they're a bunch of people out there and their response to this shouldn't be sort of this ethno nationalist let's all get together and ban the foreigners kind of stuff what it should be is the only way we can protect individual rights is with a nationalism that suggests that we have something to stand for and unfortunately that's not what's happened instead what you've gotten is the far left that's taken over the EU which it always was going to and it's taken over government in Britain which it apparently was always going to and then you've seen a nationalist right in response this is what makes American conservatism so different there's no such thing as American conservatism in Europe this is why whenever you have discussions about the Nazis what people tend to say on the left is they say well they're a right-wing group and when people on the right will say oh no they're a left-wing group and the truth is that by American standards they're a left-wing group okay the Nazis were a group of big government fascists who wanted the government controlling every aspect of American life which sounds a lot more like the American Left than like the American right but in but in Europe the Nazis were right-wing because they were anti-communist there is no such thing as an individual right States primarily in Europe it doesn't exist anymore Britain was the closest thing to it and Britain has overthrown that Britain has thrown that out America is the best of the rights regime that that the Europeans were supposedly the originators of and now the Europeans have decided to do away with that in the name of tolerance and diversity and multiculturalism a few years back it looked like the Europeans were finally going to rebell in the proper way against this David Cameron gave a big speech about how multiculturalism was a giant fail I mean even Angela Merkel came out and said multiculturalism was a giant fail but just because they said it publicly didn't mean they felt it privately or that they were going to implement policies that protected individual rights that only come from a particular civilization one of the great lies that's been told by members of the international left by a lot of folks in Europe by a lot of folks on the American left is that individual rights just inherently crop up that they are self-evident that they are not the products of any sort of civilization and so you can get rid of all of the cultural hallmarks of a civilization you can embrace multiculturalism but keep the rights that's not how it works if you want to embrace multiculturalism that means that you are inevitably going to be embracing cultures that do not value particularly the rights that you created have a little bit more on this but first I want to say thanks towards sponsors over at ring so rings mission is to make

bucks off your ring of security kit and you also let them know and that we sent you hey the real question is what sort of values must once again crop up in Europe to protect the rights that were born in Europe and the answer is pride in a civilization not pride in ethnicity not pride in the borders of a nation not pride even in a quote unquote common culture the culture of Liberty is the culture that should be instilled ok the West Western civilization is considered a civilization because of its Creed and its Creed was individual rights trumped communal rights that didn't hold true in a lot of the European countries like France the French Revolution versus the American Revolution the American Revolution was about the individual over the community have you read the Constitution of the United States he talks about We the People instituting a government in order to protect our individual rights and then there's Bill of Rights that specifically applies to individuals and then there's the French Declaration of the Rights of Man which suggested the opposite it suggested that communal rights Trump the individual it says that any time an individual right comes into conflict with the community the community wins well Britain used to be very much against the French Revolution a Edmund Burke who's the great of conservatism embraced by so many conservatives today Russell Kirk great American author wrote about the impact of Burke on American conservatism and that's because what Edmund Burke said is that the French Revolution took all of the cultural hallmarks they took Church they took religion they took culture they took history and they threw all of them out in favor of this newfangled idea of rights and what Edmund Burke said is that the rights that we currently have are a product of a civilization that goes back thousands of years and to reject that premise is to reject the rights themselves well Europe has now fallen under the French revolutionaries one hey the French revolutionaries chopped off a lot of heads and it seemed like they'd fallen but in the end they won hey in the end the French one and the Burkean the Burkean conservatism the Lockean conservatism lost hey Burke and Locke were both religious Christians and there were both believers that there had to be a culture a civilization of Liberty in order for Liberty to mean anything the French didn't believe that they believed you could completely level everything and get rid of the entire culture and instead you can build up the system of Rights which in the end would be protected by a community and the community in the end would also be able to Trump the individual well Britain has fallen to that now it is not a coincidence that as church attendance has declined in Britain you've seen the rise of a multicultural ethos that ends in the arrest of British citizens for reporting on trials and gives the go-ahead to abortion hey that is not a coincidence you do need a certain foundation in order for that edifice of values to stand and that edifice of values is obviously crumbling in Europe and so you have to wonder why did it crumble and the answer is pretty obvious I know it's not popular I know a lot of people don't want to hear maybe you ought to look at your church maybe you ought to look back to God maybe you ought to look back to founding values in the United States which were reliance on the idea of Providence of divine eternal Providence who provided for individual rights I know that's uncomfortable stuff and people would prefer to go with all of these vague answers about rights existing in some sort of weird sphere without any sort of judeo-christian history to them you get rid of the judeo-christian history the rights go along with them yeah it's just the way that it works and Europe is finding that out there pretends that it can maintain the rights without maintaining the history that just it's not working it's not working and so you get yes yes on abortion and no uncovering trials in the same weekend in Great Britain one time the only defender of civilization in the Western world so it's it's it's really a sad thing and I think that it is something deeply worth morning okay meanwhile I have to comment on something that happened over the weekend with with with the left and immigration because it's utterly insane so over the weekend the left decided that Donald Trump was solely responsible for the separation of parents from children at the border so first I want to set for you the legal standard because you're hearing a lot of crap today you're hearing a lot of nonsense today that is just not true it's why you're hearing today is that Donald Trump Evo president Trump has decided in his nefarious fashion because he hates Mexicans cuz he thinks they're all rapists that when people come to the border than what he's going to do is he's going to take their children and rip them away from their parents and he's going to send them to the salt mines or some such nonsense okay the reality is that by law by law all detainees all miner detainees in the United States must be must be remanded out of custody to somebody else within 20 days this has been the law in the United States for approximately the last 20 years 21 years there was a settlement in 1997 is called the Flores settlement it happened under the auspices of President Bill Clinton okay and in that settlement it found that settlement said that unaccompanied minors is specifically about unaccompanied minors and it said unaccompanied minors to the United States people come to the United States and they're not accompanied by a parent they cannot be held in detainment facilities instead they have to be released to foster care or they have to be released to some sort of relative we can track down okay that was the Flores settlement in 1997 it did not apply to accompanied minors so if a parent came with their kid then there was no legal obligation under the 1997 Flores agreement that you have to take the kid out of custody and give the kid to an uncle or an aunt instead the kid could stay in custody with the parent until there was a settlement okay this settlement took place in two with it well actually until there was a Yazzie was it it was a piece of legislation in 2008 and then it was reinsuring in 2016 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2016 in an opinion by Judge Hurwitz okay Andrew Hurwitz they ruled that the settlement the 1997 1997 settlement agreement did not only apply to unaccompanied minors you could enroll them in custody it also applied to accompany minors in other words if I came my four-year-old daughter and we were Mexican immigrants illegal immigrants we cross the border illegally and when I was arrested under the old law we could be held together in custody because she's my four year old under the new law under the settlement agreement the idea was that my four-year-old daughter was not best off in custody with me she was best off being remanded to Aunt Martha in in Texaco right and then we're going to send and we're gonna send Aunt Martha to wherever with the kid okay that was the law this is what it says in that in that court decision from the Ninth Circuit 2016 quote the panel held that the settlement unambiguously applies both to minors who are accompanied and unaccompanied by their parents the panel tell however the district court erred in interpreting the settlement to provide release rights to accompanying adults so didn't mean that you had to release the adult right so this is what the Ninth Circuit ruled the Ninth Circuit says you do not have to release the adults but you do have to release the kids well what that means practically speaking is that after 20 days the kids have to be released so if you want to arrest the adults then the adults have to remain in custody and the kids have to be released is that Donald Trump's fault no that's been the law since before Donald Trump was president has been the law for a long time it's been the law since Obama was president and the 1997 settlement agreement was put into law 20 years ago so why exactly are people saying that Donald Trump is the guy who's running around internment facilities ripping children away from parents and handing them out to the nearest passers-by it's just not true it's just not true now what's more astonishing is all the members of the left who've decided to to make an issue of this and decided that really is all Trump's fault so to show you this okay I just have to I have to give you some of these sweets so Jon Favreau hey one of the pods have america bros jon favreau was a member of the obama administration he served in the Obama administration there's a picture from 2014 that was going around of children in holding facilities these children were unaccompanied minors and they're put in holding facilities in 2014 now you may recall 2014 who was president was the Trump no it was President Barack Obama you remember that guy right he was annoying you remember that guy well that dude put all those kids in these holding facilities Jon Favreau was working for the administration or did work for the administration he tweeted out the 2014 photos as though Donald Trump had put these kids in the holding facilities here's what he tweeted quote look at these pictures this is happening right now and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible it's not just John Favreau Shaun King tweeted the same thing Linda Sarsour tweeted the same thing they all treated out these pictures and they pretended that they were all from 2018 when they were all from 2014 then they found out they're from 2014 bunch of these people started deleting their tweets so Jon Favreau got rid of his tweet because it turns out that it just wasn't true all of which goes to show you that something weird has happened to members of the media and I have more to talk about with regard to this weirdness in just one second but first I want to say thanks to our sponsors at Dollar Shave Club so if you ever a

the weekend she tweeted out a picture of herself with her child because it's Memorial Day weekend and she has really cute kids and she tweeted out a picture of her selves a beautiful picture of her holding one of her children and it says my love I love Sunday morning okay and that's in it's it's my love and I hashtag Sunday morning and it's picture of her and one of her babies and she's just looking the baby's eyes CNN decides that this is inappropriate if Uncle Trump cannot tweet a picture of herself with her child not well Donald Trump is whipping immigrant children away from their parents no he can't do that and she can't do that CNN actually did this okay I'm not joking about this CNN actually for two minutes and 30 seconds covered Ivanka Trump's tweet and suggested she was a bad person for tweeting out a picture unrelated of her and her child it's insane what's the timing of this tweet that is really generating so much criticism because it comes like you mentioned amid scrutiny of the administration's policies letting the government separate children from their parents at the border President Trump himself was tweeting about it over the weekend describing it as a horrible law and it's not the first time that Ivanka Trump has been accused of insensitivity on social media recall for example in January of last year right after her father was inaugurated she posted a picture of her and Jared Kushner and fancy Black Tie attire right after her father had signed that controversial travel ban and there were chaos and protests erupting at airports all over the country she weathered similar criticism and once again she's being accused of being out of touch you have got to be kidding me it's Memorial Day weekend she was had a picture of her and her baby and she's evil now this really is do you remember in the Wrath of Khan in the Wrath of Khan you know one of the fam great political movies of our time there was a there's a scene very early on where an earworm is put inside who is it check off I think and I put an earworm and check off the ear and the idea is that these ear worm essentially controls his brain Donald Trump is the ear worm for some reason he's the ear worm in the brain of the media and no matter what he does we wiggling around in there the media just lose it because what in the world does this picture of Ivanka Trump and her beautiful kid have to do with immigrant kids being separated from their parents a policy that has been in place in the United States since 2016 at the behest of the leftist nine Circuit Court of Appeals what in the hell what in the hell and here's how amazing the media are so you have all these fact-checking sites now all these fact-checking sets like factcheck.org and PolitiFact and half of their fact checks are just wrong half their fact checks they legitimately draw a conclusion that no one drew from an original statement and then they say that it's half true or not half true based on whether it's a democrat or republican you remember most famously PolitiFact said that barack obama was not lying when he said they said it was half true and he said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor and then three years later they labeled that same exact statement their lie of the year okay which is because they're full of it because they're full of it well factcheck.org is going after President Trump because President Trump suggests that hey it's not my fault that these kids are being separated from their parents which is true it's not his fault it's not as well but here's what factcheck.org writes okay neither the court settlement nor the 2008 law require the Trump administration to break up families they required the government to release children from custody after a certain period of detainment the government absolutely has the option to release the parents as well said Sarah Pierce a policy analyst and migration policy institute that's as long as they aren't in flight or safety risk and then they say Trump is lying so let me explain what that means and let me explain how stupid that is hey the what they are saying is that Donald Trump doesn't have to separate the parents and the children now you might ask Shapiro you told us a few minutes ago that under the law if you want to retain the parents you do have to discharge the children somewhere else right you do so the left is claiming it's Trump's fault because he's arresting the parents so if Trump really didn't want to separate the parents from the kids he should just let them lose he does not detain them at all you understand how insane this is this is like complaining that children in the United States are being separated from felon parents because we arrest the felon parents and they say well do you want the kids to go with and I'm like no but you could release the felon parents the whole point is that Trump is enforcing the border now the only thing that Trump is doing differently than Obama is he's romancing more cases to custody than President Obama's and Obama was fine with letting illegal immigrants roam into the country he briefly arrested and then be released into the general population Trump is not but under the law if he keeps the parents he has to release the kids okay now here's the thing if Democrats wanted to solve this they could solve this tomorrow they could solve this tomorrow they could change the law and they could change the law to say that when illegal immigrants come into the country with the children that there is an exception to this court ruling they could overrule the judicial branch because the judicial branch is interpreting a settlement agreement they're not interpreting a Constitution okay just legally speaking when they say that the settlement says X all the government has to do is pass a law saying that is not what the settlement says the government this helmet never said that in fact the government right now that the legislature could overrule the judiciary simply by taking away their capacity to review the situation that is an ability of Congress under article 1 of the Constitution is to limit federal jurisdiction but they're not doing any of that instead Democrats are complaining about all of this because it's more important to complain about all of this and pretend that Donald Trump is evil than it is to actually solve the problems for a lot of these kids okay so in just a second I want to talk a little bit about some more insanity from the left on this particular topic first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at genja cells so you have those bags under your eyes so I get bags under my eyes when I do not sleep properly and this is true for a lot of people bags and puffiness under the eyes they're a problem for millions of American men and women but there's something called genu cell serum it has plant stem cell technology from Shama knee bending this serum since like my days doing a radio show in Seattle spent four or five years Susan from New Jersey writes I've been using Jane yourself for a couple of months the puffiness around my eyes is gone even the crow's feet small lines they've disappeared they haven't come back I love the product I use it under my eyes around my cheekbones on my eyelids when it comes to our house my mom actually creeps into the house and

media overall this is not just that they're going after Ivanka Trump April Ryan you know she's on CNN all the time because she's a political analyst over there and she's always complaining about how she's being victimized by the Trump administration she's also a reporter for American urban radio networks I believe while she shared an article on her Twitter account on Sunday floating the idea that President Trump could be running a child sex trafficking ring no joke paid the tot the article was titled April Ryan CNN contributor tweets the sow quote is the Trump administration running a child trafficking ring or na follow me down the rabbit hole okay so she tweets that out hey why exactly would she tweet that out well shared with 330,000 or her followers and Melania Trump's spokesperson Stephanie Grisham responded if you're a journalist with many followers at CNN politics contributor is it okay to retreat any headline you want regardless of whether it's true okay a lot of other people were similarly upset about April Ryan sweet now I just want to point something out here pizza gate was fake I wasn't a real thing there was a comet ping-pong pizza or whatever the hell that that pizza shop was called in Washington DC that was not actually running a child sex ring out of it and people who were saying the pizza gate was real were fooling you okay and they're ripped by the media the media said Pizza Gate is fake in the media we're right Pizza Gate was not real there was no evidence of child sex trafficking ring being run out of a pizza shop in DC Donald Trump is not running a child sex trafficking ring and yet April Ryan is not feeling that same kind of blowback weird isn't that in that weird she tweets out a piece suggesting that perhaps Donald Trump is running a child sex trafficking ring the President of the United States and nothing nothing right where's the blowback on April Ryan there is no blowback on April Ryan why because everything is stupid and because the ear worm that is Donald Trump has infected the brains of too many folks in the media okay so I also want to talk about what's going on at Starbucks in just a second but for that you're

the big day at Starbucks it's the big day at Starbucks today all racism in the United States ends it's over congratulations it's it I know you thought to yourself but aren't there still races out there no there aren't they're all gone you know how it happened Starbucks shut down for three hours and talked about implicit bias it was unbelievable so you remember just a few weeks ago there was a grave injustice that was done at a Starbucks in Philadelphia a grave horrific injustice there are two black guys who went into a Starbucks in Philadelphia and I had my listen one of several of my listeners go to that Starbucks the person behind the counter the manager was a social justice warrior lady who correct people's pronouns but it turns out she is secretly on a racist how do we know she's secretly a racist we know she's secretly on racists because they asked to use the restroom and she said just like I have been asked before everyone I know a lot of people when asked if you want to use the restroom you gotta buy something hey they said no and she said okay and they go and they sit down they're sitting there for a while she says well are you going to buy something said no we're waiting for someone and she said well you probably need to buy something and they said no and she said well if you buy you don't buy something I need to ask you to leave they said no and she said well if you do um see that I'm gonna call the police and they said no and then police came and said well if you just buy something we don't have to arrest you think I said no okay and then they got arrested racism right deep abiding horrific racism now as I pointed out at the time I believe there were six cameras in the Starbucks establishment six of them okay we still don't have tape of the entire exchange so we don't actually know what happened but let's assume that this woman was a descendant of Bull Connor and bred in her bones was hatred of black people for some reason it had never come out before in Philadelphia which is like a very very heavily black City and this particular Starbucks apparently is in a location where there are a lot of black patrons in any case let's assume that the story is just as good morning America I told it it was a vicious instance of 1960s Woolworth counter type discrimination okay so what what does Starbucks decide to do they decided we are going to shut down 8,000 of our stores for three hours and we're going to give people all sorts of unconscious bias training now the thing that unconscious bias is that it's stupid the reason it's stupid is because unconscious bias has no actual correlation with your behavior so the suggestion of unconscious biases you may not act racist you may never have done anything racist you may not think you're racist but deep down inside that teeny-weeny beating heart of yours lies the heart of a monster deep down in there you hate black people don't you and even if you don't you can even if you say no I don't believe you because it's unconscious so you don't you wouldn't even if you hated black people we wouldn't know about it there's no way for us to know but we do know because down deep in your soul you hate black so this is the whole schtick about unconscious bias so they give these implicit assessment bias tests which are completely flawed they are scientifically flawed they're not duplicate they're not repeatable they make no sense there is no correlation the people who designed is the implicit assessment test the implicit bias assessment test even those people say that these are not usable in real-world situations doesn't matter Starbucks decides they're gonna mandate that nobody can get coffee for three hours so we can pretend that we're doing something about deep abiding racism at Starbucks so what is this really designed to do okay so what it's really designed to do is prevent litigation against these major corporations that's really what it's designed to do so major corporations all over the country places like Walmart and Target have undertaken this useless diversity training to relieve such unconscious by so let me describe to you what these Starbucks baristas had to go through okay quote is from Yahoo anti-bias sessions can incorporate personal reflections explorations of feelings and mental exercises which is like push-ups but for your brain one expert says training of this kind can have the opposite effect if people feel judged so it might make them more races so next time you go into Starbucks maybe they'll be more ice due knows but we got to do the training guys because they say we have to according to a video previewing the Starbucks training there will be recorded remarks from Starbucks executives and rapper and activists common that's the important part of common says it we all take it very seriously I mean it's common sense from their employees we'll move into a real and honest exploration of bias where in small groups they can share how the issue comes up in their daily work life then they get out finger paints and they'll paint with each other it's really fun and then who trusts Falls and then at the end of that racism has been abolished in the United States now there's no data any of this works hey Andrew Ferguson writes at The Weekly Standard quote most recently the Harvard psychologist Frank Dobbin had counted his way through more than 800 midsize and large US companies that had made diversity training mandatory as Starbucks is doing Oh five year period he found no increase in the percentage of managers who are women or minorities in fact the number of black female managers declined more than nine percent that of Asian men four point five percent but that data doesn't actually mean anything because data doesn't mean anything in these conversations he can't even ask for the freaking tape of these of these actual events you just have to assume that racism is widespread unconscious deeply embedded in art in our DNA as President Obama used to say and then we're going to Train it out of you we're gonna Train it out of you by paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to people with no degree in anything who call themselves diversity trainers that's how we're gonna fix this now why do all these corporations do this because when there are class-action lawsuits it can cost them a billion dollars if they lose so instead they create a settlement with all of these race baiters and they say ok we will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on diversity training and next time there's some sort of litigation against us we go in front of the judge and we say listen if we were really racist would we have done diversity training seriously this is what they do this is actually part of the policy it is a litigation strategy by attorneys to prevent litigation against these major companies because then they can say listen that racist thing that person did outside scope of agency they weren't our agent they weren't our messengers when they were doing that they were doing it on their own because they're just bad people we're not bad people we do diversity training we listen to common and man we love common common is awesome and that means that no one here is racist it's a if you think that Starbucks became one iota less racist if you thought they're races in the first place which I do not but if you think they become one iota less racist because they took three hours out from making coffee to talk with each other about racism you're out of your mind you're out of your mind but again this is all a scam it was meant to be a scam they're barely even hiding the ball on this one okay meanwhile going through some of the other news of the day I want to make a quick point here so that there's been a lot of talk in the last in the last few days about Louis Farrakhan so Lewis Farrakhan who is legitimately one of the worst human beings in the United States just an awful awful human being a leader of the Nation of Islam rabid anti-semite rabid racist just a piece of human direct so Louis Farrakhan was on a radio show and he was talking about President Trump and Candace Owens tweeted out that something is happening because Louis Farrakhan obviously is more warm toward president more one for President Trump now this is not me getting a Candace okay Candace can have her own opinion on this stuff but I do not think that this is that was Farrakhan is saying he's gonna vote for President Trump and if he did I don't think it would behoove president Trump to take his support since as I say Lou's Farrakhan is a piece of human track here is Louis Farrakhan supposedly supporting President Trump Trump is destroying every enemy that was an enemy of our rise oh who the enemy of our rise is it the Department of Justice where we get none is it Congress where you make a law that favors us and then you turn around and destroy it okay so here's what I would say about this if Luce Farrakhan is siding with Donald Trump it should make you think about some of trumps policies if was Farrakhan Ranas now I don't think blues Farrakhan is honest I think as I say he's a horrible human but what he's really saying here is that he likes that Trump is going after the DOJ and the FBI and he likes that because who's Farrakhan is sort of in favor of many criminals so this I'm not really sure why exactly people would be celebrating that in any serious way well in other news Tesla founder Elon Musk has now been accused of being means of the media which is a crime in the United States as we all know so last week Elon Musk who founded Tesla and SpaceX he does some pretty cool stuff although I will acknowledge I'm not a big fan of the giant giant giant government subsidies he receives he tweeted out that the holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie is why the public no longer respects them which is true and then somebody tweeted back at him that he's that he's like a trump figure he said thought you'd say that anytime anyone criticizes the media the media shrieks you're just like Trump why do you think he got elected in the first place because no one believes you anymore you lost her credibility a long time ago so Iman musk has been taken to task by a bunch of people in the media how dare Elan musk attack the media the most obvious and stupid piece came courtesy of a woman in Darren Biba at The Daily Beast cases she attacked Musk because she tweeted at him a billionaire with massive power lashed out at two of the most under attack industries in the country journalism and science both are essential for democracy first of all journalism is not an under attack institution in the United States hey just because people say they don't trust the media doesn't mean that journalism is under attack there's no legislation against journalism there's no attempt to quash journalism thank God that's good and then she says Elon Musk is an irresponsible person who doesn't seem to realize or care about the damage she's doing our love affair with billionaires needs to end okay that last sentence doesn't really seem to follow because there are lots of different billionaires in lots of different industries it's a must tweeted back quote I've never attacked science definitely attack misleading journalism like yours though and then people sent mean tweets to this lady and she proceeded to write a full-on piece about how Elan musk was mean to her and here's what she wrote musk stweet turned into a singularity of hate against currently targeted institutions in our country the musk bros had a lot of opinions about me being a woman criticizing their hero and the maggots that were thrilled that someone with such a big file one was on their side against science and journalism so in other words he says the media's full of it she says how dare you attack the media he says you're full of it and then she proves that she's full of it that's basically how that that little colloquy just went and then she took out a bunch of people from Twitter who have like 10 followers and blamed them on Elon Musk which is the new tactic of a lot of folks on the left and it's really irritating this tactic where they suggest that if you have millions of followers as musk as or if I have or as many other people have and one of those followers several of those followers do something terrible that somehow our fault no okay if you don't like what musk says attack what musk says don't attack must for what his followers say when he obviously didn't attempt to push them to do any of this sort of stuff but the media are no longer for the truth there are too many members of the media who are no longer fur to the truth they're more interested in propping up their own perception of self-worth and a lot of that has to do with this feeling that we are firefighters and we cannot be attacked if they accuse president Trump of having a thin skin or conservatives of having a thin skin nobody has thinner skin than some of the members the mainstream media it's truly astonishing okay time for a couple of things that I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like today I have been starting a new series on Netflix I know not the Michelle what's-her-face wolf series not not her not her foolish attempts to do Weekend Update I haven't started that yet I'll probably I'll probably watch some of that tonight so I can put it in things I hate I may be I love it maybe I well I don't want to prejudge it I have a feeling it's gonna suck but you know other things that I like there's a show called Babylon Berlin that's really good it's a it's a German series is the most expensive ever made in Germany and it takes place during the let the latter days of the vitamin Republic and it doesn't really make any it makes a very oblique reference to Hitler but it makes very few references to the Nazis or Hitler it is just sort of here's the milieu so it gives you the communist uprising that's happening and it gives you the roots of Nazi rage in Germany and it gives you all of this against the backdrop of basically a crime show an investigation of a crime that ties together all of these disparate strands here's a little bit of the preview from Netflix that shows Babylon Berlin I have been told that our mutual friend is doing business on the side he's ambitious dogged a ferret I'll deal with it what happened here me so the production values on this thing are really really high you know obviously the previews in English but it's dubbed so if I were you I would watch it in the original German and with the subtitles I just think it's it's less irritating and less distracting but the show is I'm three episodes in it's quite good I'll keep you updated if it turns around in stinks then you'll hear about it but so far so good okay other things okay time you know what let's do some things I hate so things that I hate so today they're a bunch of rockets mortars that were fired into Israel apparently 50 odd mortars fired into southern Israel there are a two terrorists who attempted to cut the border from the Gaza Strip into Israel with bolt cutters to get into Israel and murder children in their beds because this is what Hamas terrorists do and Israel has been bombing Gaza Strip so naturally all the media coverage has been Israel bombs Gaza Strip very little of the media coverage has been about the fact that Hamas precipitated it by literally putting hundreds of thousands of people into bunkers right they forced hundreds of thousands of people into bunkers in southern Israel and then they hit a kindergartner a kindergarten with mortars one of the mortars directly hit a kindergarten there were no kids in it thank God but this this is just a reminder Hamas is a terrorist group Islamic Jihad is a terrorist group what happened at the Gaza border two weeks ago was a terrorist activity it and and so here's my mock headline for the media peaceful Palestinian terrorist fire peaceful mortars at Jewish kindergarten attempt peaceful murderous border breaches against Israel because they're all peaceful don't you know Hamas is peaceful Islamic Jihad is peaceful it's been so irritating watching the media cover all this stuff when they are being eminently and obviously dishonest about all of it no wonder so many like Elon Musk are looking at the media and saying you guys don't know what the hell you are doing meanwhile other things that I hate so this was pretty terrible yesterday Chelsea Manning tweeted out pictures of himself on top of a building so Chelsea Manning a formerly Bradley Manning traitor to the United States but released thanks to a thanks to a commutation of sentence did he get fully pardoned by Obama I believe he was calm I think his sentence was commuted he wasn't fully pardoned but he tweeted out a picture of a top from the top of the building and to I'm sorry I tried and it basically a suicide note as it appeared on Twitter and the N Chelsea Manning I hope really really does get some help you know Chelsea Manning is still as much I despise what Chelsea Manning did as far as being a traitor and as much as I disagree with Chelsea Manning about politics if you need help get help like if you need help get help suicide is not the answer even for people with whom I disagree politically okay we were we're all children of God even people who I think have done despicable things in the past Chelsea Manning apparently is getting help so thank God for that but we all ought to be praying for people who are under the suicidal impulse because obviously that's something very hard okay time for a final thing that I hate so a president Trump you know he celebrated memorial take yesterday in a couple of ways one was good one was bad it was ultimate good Trump bad Trump so good Trump was he he gave a speech all about Memorial Day he put up some clips from that speech I believe it was in front of an Naval grad audience and he he put up some clips of that on Twitter that was great then he also put up this tweet which was not so great so he tweeted out happy Memorial Day those who died for a great country would be very happy and proud of how well our country is doing today best economy in decades lowest unemployment numbers for blacks and Hispanics ever and women in 18 years rebuilding our military and so much more nice ah no wrong you did it wrong mr. president this is not a good tweet hey Barack Obama had a really bad habit his bad habit was no matter what was happening in the world there's Memorial Day he would then tweet out a picture of himself like Adam Memorial Day ceremony he wouldn't weed out pictures of soldiers or something he would tweet out pictures of him because Barack Obama was the most important person in the universe well Donald Trump seems to be following in those footsteps except worse in this particular tweet the idea that these troops would be very happy and proud of how our country is doing today because he's done such a great job in office so all of these slain troops would be big fans like that's not what the day is for and I think that he realized that later and then tweeted out some more appropriate feelings but this is why when when some people like me say he might want to cut back on the Twitter this is an example of why the president might want to cut back on the Twitter because let's be real about this if this had been Hillary Clinton tweeting this out I would be all over that I would be screaming at her I would have spent 15 minutes on the show about that okay what Donald Trump did in this tweet is really quite gross you are not allowed to tout your own accomplishments in office in a tweet honoring slain soldiers that's just not something you can do it's not something that is appropriate it's not something that is and that tweet is not appropriate or decent again he put another tweet that was quite appropriate and quite decent but this one was not OK so we'll be back here tomorrow with all of the latest to top North Korean official is apparently visiting the United States love all the updates on what goes on there I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben
