rather than getting that new iPhone that
they just love and they want to go spend
hundreds of dollars that maybe they
should invest it in their own health
care we're getting rid of the individual
mandate we're getting rid of those
things that people said that they don't
want and you know what Americans have
choices and they've got to make a choice
and so maybe rather than getting that
new iPhone that they just love and they
want to go spend hundreds of dollars
that maybe they should invest it in
their own health care they've got to
make those decisions themselves so maybe
rather than getting that new iPhone that
they just love and they want to go spend
hundreds of dollars not maybe they
should invest it in their own health
care
