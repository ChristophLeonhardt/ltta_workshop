Martha: REPUBLICANS COULD LOSE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE IF HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF AS THE PARTY DEALS WITH INFIGHTING AND LEADERSHIP UNCERTAINTY WITH THE IMPENDING EXIT OF THE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN. AND RUMORS THAT HE IS BEING PUSHED OUT BY HIS OWN PARTY TO CLEAR WAY. FOR MAJORITY LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY. THERE ARE RUMORS SWIRLING THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT IS WAGING A SHADOW CAMPAIGN OF HIS OWN FOR 2020. I ASKED THE VICE PRESIDENT ABOUT BOTH. Martha: A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER PAUL RYAN SHOULD LEAVE EARLY. ONE REPORT THIS MORNING SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT SEES THE MERITS OF THAT PLAN, OF AN EARLIER EXIT FOR PAUL RYAN AND SOONER SPEAKERSHIP FOR KEVIN McCARTHY. DO YOU AGREE? TO SEE THE MERITS OF THAT? I KNOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I HOLD SPEAKER PAUL RYAN IN THE HIGHEST REGARD. HE SPENT A GREAT PARTNER DURING THIS CONGRESS IN PASSING TAX CUTS AND DEREGULATION, HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN OUR MILITARY. YOU WILL SEE THAT PROGRESS AGAIN THIS WEEK WITH THE PASSAGE OF VA CHOICE AND BANKING REFORMS AND RIGHT TO TRY THAT WILL HELP VULNERABLE PATIENTS ALL ACROSS AMERICA. WE ALSO HOLD LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY IN THE HIGHEST REGARD AND I KNOW THE PRESIDENT'S FOCUS IS ON CONTINUING TO WORK WITH BOTH OF THESE LEADERS IN THE DAYS AHEAD TO MAKE PROGRESS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. Martha: SO DO YOU THINK THAT PAUL RYAN WILL BE BEFORE THE MIDTERM? I THINK THAT WILL BE A DECISION FOR SPEAKER RYAN. Martha: HE SAID HE WANTS TO STAY ALL THE WAY THROUGH. HE HAS ARTICULATED THAT AND I THINK HE HAS STOOD BY THAT. BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THE PRESIDENT AND I ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO SPEAKER PAUL RYAN, TO LEADER McCARTHY, TO THE ENTIRE LEADERSHIP TEAM IN THE HOUSE. THEY'VE REALLY BEEN DELIVERING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. Martha: THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WOULD BE OKAY WITH AN EARLIER TRANSITION. I THINK I PERSONALLY WOULD BE OKAY WITH WHATEVER THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CHOSE TO DO BECAUSE THIS IS A TEAM THAT HAS BEEN DELIVERING, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, OUR FOCUS IS ON THE AGENDA THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS ELECTED TO ADVANCE IN THIS CONGRESS HAS BEEN DELIVERING ON THAT AGENDA FROM DAY ONE. Martha: WHAT ABOUT ALL THESE ARTICLES ABOUT YOUR SHADOW CAMPAIGN OPERATION AND THAT YOU ARE SEEKING TO EXERCISE EXPANSIVE CONTROL OVER THE POLITICAL PARTY THAT IS OSTENSIBLY HOMED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP? THE PRESIDENT IS NOT ONLY PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HE'S THE LEADER OF MY PARTY AND HE'S MY FRIEND AND IT WAS MY GREAT HONOR TO CAMPAIGN SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH HIM IN 2016 AND I LOOK FORWARD TO DOING EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP REELECTED IN 2020. IN THE MEANTIME WE'VE GOT SOME MIDTERM ELECTIONS COMING UP AND EARLIER THIS YEAR WE WENT TO CAMP DAVID AND WE MET WITH SOME OF THOSE SAME CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT AND WE LAID OUT AN AGENDA THAT THE PRESIDENT AND I HAVE BEEN EXECUTING ON SEAMLESSLY. I CAN PROMISE YOU WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO CAMPAIGN HARD ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE MIDTERMS. WE ARE GOING TO SEE THESE REPUBLICAN MAJORITIES REELECTED AND WE ARE GOING TO LAY A GREAT FOUNDATION TO REELECT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. LOOK AT THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE, MARTHA. IT'S INCREDIBLE. MORE THAN 3 MILLION JOBS. Martha: REPORTEDLY STORIES COME FROM THAT YOU HAVE THE SHADOW ORGANIZATION? WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM? IT BEATS ME. I DON'T KNOW OTHER THAN JUST THE WHISPER CAMPAIGN THAT TENDS TO HAPPEN IN WASHINGTON, D.C., FROM TIME TO TIME. IT'S THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. HE'S NOT A LIMIT PRESIDENT, BUT HE'S MY FRIEND. WE'VE DEVELOPED A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP. Martha: IS HE HEARD OF THE STORIES? Martha: I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF THE STORIES. Martha: DOES HE REVIEW ABOUT THE STORIES? HE RIPS ME ABOUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS, BUT IT'S A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP AND KAREN AND I ARE JUST, WE ARE GRATEFUL. IF WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP, WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE FRIENDSHIP AND WE COULDN'T BE MORE HAPPY TO SEE MELANIA BACK AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND
