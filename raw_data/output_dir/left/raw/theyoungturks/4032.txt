1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,620
THERE IS WORD THAT A UNITY
TICKET FOR THE 2020 ELECTION IS

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,750
GOING TO BE COMING ACROSS OUR
LANDSCAPE.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,830
JOHN KASICH, YOU WILL

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,410
REMEMBER, THE WINNER OF THE NEW
HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY, THE LAST

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,120
REALLY VIABLE CANDIDATE TO LEAVE
THE RACE IN 2016, THE GOVERNOR

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,220
OF OHIO, HE WOULD PROBABLY SAY
THAT FIRST, HE AND JOHN

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,279
HICKENLOOPER, THE GOVERNOR OF
COLORADO AND FORMER MAYOR OF

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:36,190
DENVER, THERE ARE RUMORS THAT
THEY WILL FORM A UNITY TICKET.

9
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:50,829
THE SOURCE THAT BROKE THIS STORY
TO CNN SAID 

10
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:51,829
THIS --

11
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,170
JIMMY, WHY CAN'T IT HAPPEN IN
WASHINGTON?

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,361
I'LL TELL YOU THIS, I DON'T
KNOW THE ANSWER OF WHAT IT CAN

13
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:06,859
HAPPEN IN WASHINGTON, BUT THIS
IS SO BACKWARDS.

14
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,409
PEOPLE THINK

15
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,499
THIS IS WHAT AMERICA WANTS.

16
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:13,070
PEOPLE IN A BUBBLE THINK THAT.

17
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,080
NO NORMAL, REGULAR PERSON THAT
I'VE EVER TALKED TO WANTS TO SEE

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,249
THIS HAPPEN.

19
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:23,500
HICKENLOOPER, WHO
WAS IN BED WITH FRACKERS, HE'S A

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,240
NEO-LIBERAL, I HAD HIGHER HOPES
FOR HIM THAN WHAT HE'S TURNING

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,520
OUT TO BE, BUT NO ONE IS SAYING
WE REALLY NEED FOR DEMOCRATS TO

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,549
BECOME MORE LIKE REPUBLICANS, OR
FOR REPUBLICANS TO BECOME --

23
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:38,659
NO ONE IS SAYING THIS.

24
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,490
THIS IS SOME FAKE IDEA THAT
CHRIS MATTHEWS PROBABLY

25
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,009
THOUGHT UP, BECAUSE I'VE HEARD
HIM SAY THIS BEFORE, HE

26
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,350
TOLD HILLARY CLINTON THAT SHE
SHOULD PICK JOHN KASICH.

27
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,909
THEY DIDN'T INVENT IT,
HISTORICALLY PEOPLE HAVE TALKED

28
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,099
ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE FROM
OPPOSITE SIDES TO JOIN TOGETHER,

29
00:01:54,099 --> 00:02:00,239
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED, NOT SINCE
GORE PICKED LIEBERMAN --

30
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,450
THAT TURNED OUT WELL.

31
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,369
THAT'S AN INTERESTING
POLITICAL CONVERSATION, THEY

32
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:09,628
WERE IN THE SAME PARTY,
LIEBERMAN WAS A DEMOCRAT, IT WAS

33
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:16,810
BEFORE HE TOOK AN INDEPENDENT
RUN -- BUT I AGREE WITH YOU,

34
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,069
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN POLITICS
DON'T WANT THAT, PEOPLE ON THE

35
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:23,209
OUTSIDE OF POLITICS HATE HEARING
THE FIGHTING, THEY HATE CONGRESS

36
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,069
AT 8% BECAUSE ALL THEY DO IS
BIGGER AND NOT GET ANYTHING

37
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,069
DONE.

38
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,650
AND I'M TALKING IN BROAD
STROKES HERE, BUT I AGREE WITH

39
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,650
YOU.

40
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,791
I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THIS, I
WOULDN'T WANT THIS, BUT WHY

41
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,140
DON'T THEY?

42
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,459
IF THESE PEOPLE
CAN'T STAND THE FIGHTING SO

43
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,590
MUCH, HAVE THESE PEOPLE JOIN, DO
A UNITY CAMPAIGN, AND GET US

44
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,790
OVER THE HUMP.

45
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,840
A SORT OF A
GERALD FORD TO GET US OUT OF

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,540
THIS MESS.

47
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,260
BECAUSE THAT THE OPPOSITE OF
HOW POLITICS IS SUPPOSED TO

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,260
WORK.

49
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,030
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
TWO PARTIES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT

50
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,760
IDEAS, AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH OUR POLITICAL CLASS, THEY

51
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,219
DON'T HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS.

52
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:01,900
HICKENLOOPER AND KASICH ARE

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,540
BOUGHT BY THE SAME PEOPLE,
THAT'S WHY THIS IS EVEN AN IDEA.

54
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,739
BECAUSE IT'S PALATABLE TO THEIR
DONOR CLASS, WHICH AS WE KNOW

55
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,200
RUNS OUR GOVERNMENT, THE
PRINCETON STUDY HAS REVEALED

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,370
THAT WE DON'T LIVE IN A
DEMOCRACY, WE LIVE IN AN

57
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,620
OLIGARCHY.

58
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,900
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
GET UPSET WHEN PEOPLE FIGHT IN

59
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,540
WASHINGTON, DC, PEOPLE GET UPSET
WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS IN

60
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,540
WASHINGTON, DC.

61
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,030
PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE BERNIE
SANDERS OR TRUMP FIGHTING,

62
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,099
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE PEOPLE
FIGHTING FOR SOMETHING, NOT

63
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,069
PRETENDING WE DON'T HAVE TO
FIGHT FOR SOMETHING.

64
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:37,349
THEN I MISSPOKE A LITTLE BIT,
BECAUSE WHAT I MEANT WAS NOT

65
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,920
LIKE THAT NOTHING GETS DONE
BECAUSE OF THE FIGHTING, NOT

66
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,950
THAT THEY DON'T WANT PASSION.

67
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,109
AND YOU ARE RIGHT WITH THE
BEGINNING OF WHAT YOU SAID,

68
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:49,269
WHICH IS THE ANSWER, POLITICS
IS ABOUT FIGHTING HARD FOR

69
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,349
YOUR SIDE, MAKING COMPROMISES,
BUT NOT COMPROMISES ABOUT

70
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:55,890
WHO LEADS THE COUNTRY AND THE
PARTY.

71
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,890
I AGREE.

72
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,389
YOU ARE RIGHT, THE
OLIGARCHS WOULD LOVE THIS.

73
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:01,389
THEY

74
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,810
WOULD LOVE FOR DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS TO COME TOGETHER TO

75
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,590
DO ALL THE STUFF THEY WANT YOU
TO DO, ALL THE CORPORATIST

76
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,650
STUFF.

77
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,049
SLASHING CORPORATE TAXES,
GUTTING REGULATION, ALLOWING

78
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:22,108
THEM TO HAVE A MONOPOLY
IN EVERY INDUSTRY.

79
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:23,109
THEY CONTROL EVERYTHING.

80
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:25,699
AND THE OLIGARCHS WOULD LOVE
JOHN KASICH.

81
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:26,699
THEY WOULDN'T

82
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,370
NECESSARILY LOVE JOHN
HICKENLOOPER, BUT JOHN KASICH I

83
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,110
WOULD IMAGINE WOULD BE THE
PRESIDENT IN THIS SITUATION.

84
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,110
SO

85
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,539
IT'S NOT A COMPROMISED TICKET,
I'LL MAKE HICKENLOOPER MY VICE

86
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:43,300
PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT
DOES NOTHING, IT WON'T HAVE ANY

87
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,300
EFFECT.

88
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,440
JOE BIDEN WAS A GOOD
CHEERLEADER, THE SENATE LOVED

89
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,340
HIM, HE WAS A GOOD LIAISON, MIKE
PENCE HASN'T MADE AS MUCH OF AN

90
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,810
IMPACT, PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WOULD
BE ABLE TO SWAY CONGRESS MORE

91
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,060
THAN HE HAS, BUT HICKENLOOPER
WOULD DO NOTHING.

92
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,570
IT WOULD BE A

93
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,550
KASICH PRESIDENCY, EVERYONE
WOULD LOVE JOHN KASICH, WHO IS

94
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,190
AN OLIGARCH.

95
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,800
THAT'S THE WHITEST
FLAG DEMOCRATS COULD THROW UP.

96
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,539
THE VICE PRESIDENT'S JOB IS TO
GO TO FUNERALS, IF THIS HAPPENED

97
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:17,080
JOHN HICKENLOOPER WOULD GO
TO THE FUNERAL OF THE

98
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,449
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

99
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,090
YOU KNOW WHO TRIED THIS WAS
BARACK OBAMA.

100
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,979
THERE WAS A

101
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,150
DISCONNECT BETWEEN OBAMA AND A
LOT OF THE MASSES, SO WHEN HE

102
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,360
SAID HE WOULD CHANGE WASHINGTON
IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY I THINK

103
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,330
PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WOULD CHANGE
THE WAY POLITICS IS DONE IN THE

104
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,020
SENSE THAT LOBBYISTS WOULD BE
OUT AND POLITICIANS WOULD BE

105
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,400
MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE.

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,639
WHAT BARACK OBAMA MEANT WAS THAT

107
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,490
HE WILL HELP THE TWO SIDES STOP
THE BICKERING AND THE FIGHTING

108
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,410
AND INSTEAD OF A RED AMERICA AND
A BLUE AMERICA THERE WILL BE A

109
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,280
PURPLE AMERICA AND WE ALL GET
ALONG, THAT WAS HIS VISION OF

110
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,850
CHANGING THE WAY WASHINGTON
WORKS.

111
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,800
BUT AS JIMMY SAID, PEOPLE

112
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,000
WANT THEIR REPRESENTATIVES TO
FIGHT FOR WHAT IS GOOD FOR YOU.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,420
THEY DO, BUT THEY DO CARE,
STEVE, ABOUT NOT GETTING

114
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,250
ANYTHING DONE.

115
00:06:06,250 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT THERE IS
FIGHTING WITHIN A PARTY TOO
