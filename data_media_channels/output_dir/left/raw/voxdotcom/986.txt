1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,220
It's official.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,480
The low carb diet craze is over.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,280
Hello New Year.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,280
Okay omniscient voice on TV, calm down.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,900
It seems every couple of years or so, there's
a new diet to try.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,900
South Beach was popular during the early 2000s,
then paleo took over towards the late 2000s.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,840
But around April 2017 you can see in this
Google Trend graph,

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,900
a new diet surpassing it.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,620
Celebrities like Halle Berry and Kourtney
Kardashian are going nuts for this diet.

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,940
Keto devotees claim that if you banish carbs
and eat lots of fat, your body will start

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,359
to actually burn fat and you'll lose weight
and even reduce your hunger in the process.

12
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:45,379
But what's lost in this keto chaos: there's
no evidence that keto diets work better than

13
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,400
any other diets for most people hoping to
slim down.

14
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,560
Although keto may be the latest in fad diets,
it's had promising results elsewhere.

15
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:02,630
It was used since the 1920s to treat epilepsy.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,560
Outcomes from this 2018 study showed its potential
in treating subjects with type-2 diabetes.

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,520
As a diet for weight loss, it's been around
for a while.

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,500
Keto's most recognizable form is from the
'60s: the Atkins Nutritional Approach, pushed

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,720
by the late doctor Robert Atkins.

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,960
RIP homie.

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,400
The theory behind this diet, the insulin carbohydrate
hypothesis, suggests that people start to

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,600
burn more calories more quickly and burn off
more fat.

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,480
And several high quality studies have debunked
these extra fat and calorie burning claims.

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,120
So exactly what foods can people eat on keto?

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,680
People are supposed to get 5% of their calories
from carbs, about 15% from protein, and 80%

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,440
from fat.

27
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,320
That means staying away from things like bread,
grains, rice, you know, cereals, chips.

28
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,610
You're definitely not going to be eating chips.

29
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:05,320
And eating lots of fish, meat, eggs, don't
throw the bacon at me!

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,119
Bacon, things like this.

31
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,090
The goal is to get your body into a state
of ketosis.

32
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,840
So basically our bodies are fueled primarily
by glucose, which we get from carbohydrates.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,349
But when you eliminate carbs and you start
to eat lots of fat, instead of burning glucose

34
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,720
for fuel, your body starts to burn fat.

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,269
To get into ketosis you need to eat less than
50 grams of carbs, or two slices of bread,

36
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:29,269
per day.

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
And of course eat a lot of fat.

38
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,560
Sounds simple, right?

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,960
Basically eat no carbs and the weight
will come right off.

40
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,320
And low carb diets like keto can sometimes
give people the impression in the short term,

41
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,049
they've lost fat.

42
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,640
When in reality it's rapid water weight-loss.

43
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,030
Plus the more extreme a diet, the less likely
a person is to stay on track.

44
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,280
The average person can't stick with the keto
diet for even six months.

45
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:06,960
It's especially challenging in a world with
temptations of easy, over-processed, and high

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,180
calorie foods at every corner.

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,319
When you stack very low carb diets like Atkins
or keto against other types of diets, in the

48
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,719
long run people lose about the same amount
of weight as they would on any diet.

49
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,359
There are always outliers, there are always
people who do really really well and it's

50
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:27,969
possible you may be one of those people, who
really benefits from a ketogenic diet.

51
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:30,400
But on average, they don't work for most people.

52
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,220
There's some hard truths about losing weight
and keeping it off.

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,849
It's really difficult.

54
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,510
It takes a long time.

55
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:44,329
And while keto may work wonders for some,
like people with diabetes, the best diet overall

56
00:03:44,329 --> 00:00:00,000
is probably one you can stick with.
