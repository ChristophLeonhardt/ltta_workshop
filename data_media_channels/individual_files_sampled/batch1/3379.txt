the one thing that I think matters the most in a relationship is that both partners are committed to making it work and both partners are caught in there for the long haul if one partner is committed but the other one doesn't really care or one partner is completely different the odds of that relationship working in my mind are kind of slim and I do feel like if both partners are really committed to making it work and that might mean changing some things that are basic about themselves we're really listening to the other person what the other person needs which might be very different than what they need that will in the end have the longest impact on the relationship so if you give me two people who really want to make their relationship work barring any weird unforeseen circumstances like one is gay and there with somebody of the opposite sex but assuming that you've got sort of two people who are basically compatible and really want to make it work you can make it work might take time and effort and energy but that in my mind is the ingredient for a long-term relationship and now we make it work you can make it great if both people are committed to making great you can't make a relationship great
