LENA BELTRE, ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

236
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,654

237
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,724
SPECIFICALLY, YOU TALKED ABOUT 

238
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:37,963
THE CORSAGE AND THE ARLINGTON.  

239
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:38,597
ABOUT HOW SOON DO YOU ESTIMATE 

240
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:39,098
THOSE TWO SHIPS WILL BE 

241
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:39,799
ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET TO THE 

242
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:40,399
AFFECTED AREA CONSIDERING THE 

243
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:48,608
SLOW PACE OF THE STORM?  AND 

244
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,242
THEN I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. 

245
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:49,809
>>  LITERALLY, THEY ARE 

246
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,510
DEPENDENT ON THE STORMS TRACK.  

247
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,110
THEY ARE LITERALLY FOLLOWING 

248
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,614
THE STORM IN.  

249
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,248
AS THE STORM PROGRESSES THEY 

250
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:55,615
PROGRESS IN.  

251
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,249
THERE DEPENDENT ON THE WEATHER 

252
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:56,916
CONDITIONS TO CLEAR TO BE ABLE 

253
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,250
TO COME IN.  

254
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,117
THAT'S WHY WE ARE NOT LOOKING 

255
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:03,455
AT THEM THE RESPONSIBILITY TO 

256
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:04,089
COME FROM THE SEA BUT WE HAVE 

257
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:04,790
SURROUNDED IT FROM THE LAND AS 

258
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,457
WELL SO WE CAN TAKE A BEFORE 

259
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,024
THE STORM GETS THERE . THE 

260
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:10,429
AIRCRAFT THAT WE HAVE AND THE 

261
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,096
MIRACLE OF THAT WE HAVE COMING 

262
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:11,697
FROM THE SOUTH AND WEST AND 

263
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:11,930
NORTH.  

264
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,664
WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT.  

265
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:16,768
AS THE STORM CLEARS WE MAY DOSE 

266
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:17,369
WE WILL GET THE CORSAGE AND 

267
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,003
ARLINGTON AND PICKS UP WHAT YOU 

268
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:18,670
SEE AS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE AS 

269
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,505
YOU LOOK AT THE SCOPE OF THE 

270
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:24,777
STORM AND, SPECIFICALLY, ONE OF 

271
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,145
THE ISSUES THAT HAS COME UP IN 

272
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,647
PREVIOUS STORMS AND OTHER 

273
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:32,852
DISASTERS IS THIS DOD WAITING 

274
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:41,694
FOR STATES TO ASK FOR SOMETHING 

275
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,294
THAT THE MILITARY KNOWS THEY 

276
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:42,928
SHOULD BE ASKING FOR AND THEY 

277
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:43,596
ARE NOT ASKING FOR IT YET WERE 

278
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:44,263
ASKING FOR IT QUICKLY ENOUGH.  

279
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:44,930
HOW ARE YOU ADDRESSING WHAT HAS 

280
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,531
BEEN A PERPETUAL PROBLEM?  

281
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,565
>> FIRST, I WAS A SECRETARY 

282
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:51,536
MATUS GUIDANCE TO ME IS CLEAR.  

283
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:52,170
WE ARE ANTICIPATING THE NEEDS 

284
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:52,771
AND MOVING FORWARD UNDER OUR 

285
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:53,438
OWN AUTHORITIES TO BE ABLE TO 

286
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:54,139
RESPOND AS SOON AS THAT REQUEST 

287
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:57,109
IS MADE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE 

288
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:00,178
TO GENERATE A FORCE ONCE THE 

289
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:00,612
REQUEST IS MADE.  

290
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:01,580
THAT FORCE IS IMMEDIATELY 

291
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:01,913
AVAILABLE.  

292
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:02,547
AS WE LOOK INTO THE STORM AND 

293
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:05,717
WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH 

294
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:06,418
BROCK LONG AS HE LOOKS AT WHAT 

295
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:11,090
HIS BIGGEST CHALLENGES WILL BE 

296
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,690
IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF 

297
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,358
THE STORMS LANDED WE THINK THE 

298
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:12,992
SEARCH AND RESCUE, THE VERTICAL 

299
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,126
LIFT, AND THE ABILITY TO BRING 

300
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:14,794
IN THE HELICOPTERS IS GOING TO 

301
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,228
BE A KEY ASSET.  

302
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:18,864
IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH 

303
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:19,397
ADMINISTRATOR BROCK LONG. 

304
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:21,834
>>  SO SEARCH AND RESCUE IS 

305
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,604
GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST 

306
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,071
CHALLENGE.  

307
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,038
IS THAT LIKE ALONG THE WATER'S 

308
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:26,572
EDGE?  

309
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:32,544
>> I THINK BECAUSE AS WE SEE 

310
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:33,111
THE STORM COMING IN, EVEN 

311
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:33,679
THOUGH IT HAS DEGRADED TO A 

312
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,280
CATEGORY TWO, BECAUSE OF THE 

313
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,114
LENGTH OF TIME IT WILL BE ON 

314
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,183
THE COAST AND THE HEAVY RAINFALL

315
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:38,851
THAT WILL HAPPEN WE DO THINK 

316
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,318
THE FLOODING AND STORM SURGE 

317
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:41,386
COMBINATION TOGETHER WILL BE 

318
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:44,790
VERY DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME . 

319
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,758
THE SEARCH AND RESCUE IS 

320
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,327
PROBABLY THE FIRST AND FOREMOST 

321
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,295
RESPONSE THAT WE WOULD BE 

322
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,030

324
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,766

331
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:06,612

TOOK DAYS FOR SHIPS TO GET 

371
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:23,522
THERE.  

372
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,089
THAT WAS THE KNOWLEDGE OF 

373
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:25,891
HAVING TO ASK FOR IT.  

374
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:26,892
WHAT SORT OF LESSONS HAVE BEEN 

375
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,694
LEARNED AS FAR AS RESPONDING 

376
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:29,628
AND HELP AMERICAN CITIZENS 

377
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:29,862
BECAUSE 

378
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,364
>> WE DID A DETAILED LESSON 

379
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:36,002
LEARNED PROCESS AS WE DO POST 

380
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:36,768
ANY SIGNIFICANT EVENT IN THE 

381
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:40,072
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.  WHAT WE 

382
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,574
GOT OUT OF THAT ASSESSMENT IS 

383
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:44,442
WE HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE, FOR 

384
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:50,182
EXAMPLE, TO DEVELOP A COMMON 

385
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:50,783
OPERATIONAL PICTURE THAT WE 

386
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:51,617
SHARE WITH ALL DOD ENTITIES AND 

387
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:52,351
OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS.  

388
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,085
WE HAVE A COMMON ASKING 

389
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:53,685
PICTURE, WHICH IS THE REQUEST 

390
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:55,620
THAT WE ARE GETTING OR BELIEVE 

391
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,723
THAT WE WILL BE GETTING FROM 

392
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,861
OTHER PARTNERS.  AND THEN WE 

393
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:02,561
HAVE A COMMON TASKING PICTURE.  

394
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,496
WE UNDERSTAND WHAT ASSETS FROM 

395
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,697
ONE ENTITY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT

396
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:11,803
ARE BEING SENT TO SUPPORT THE 

397
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:12,371
RESPONSE TO THE STORM.  

398
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,005
WE HAVE HAD THAT IN PLACE.  

399
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,639
WE HAVE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT 

400
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,840
IMPROVE IT'S TO THAT.  JUST 

401
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,312
BASED ON THOSE THREE STORMS 

402
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:20,812
THAT WERE OVERLAPPING, 

403
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:21,446
LITERALLY, CREATING A LEVEL OF 

404
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:22,013
INTENSITY AND DEPLETION OF 

405
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:23,015
RESOURCES THAT WAS REALLY 

406
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:33,692
UNPRECEDENTED.  

407
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,260
>> I WAS A THE CLOSE 

408
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,827
COLLABORATION THAT WE HAVE 

409
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:35,427
ESTABLISHED BETWEEN FEMA AND 

410
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:36,128
THE GOVERNORS IS ALLOWING US TO 

411
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:36,729
POPULATE THOSE DATABASES, WE 

412
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,196
FULLY UNDERSTAND THE 

413
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:37,796
REQUIREMENTS, THE NEEDS EVEN 

414
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:39,732
BEFORE THE FORMAL PROCESSING 

415
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,535
HAS BEEN COMPLETED.  

416
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,102
I THINK THE RELATIONSHIP WE 

417
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,472
HAVE RIGHT NOW IS AS STRONG AS 

418
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,873
IT IS EVER BEEN BETWEEN THE 

419
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,607
FEDERAL FORCES, THE LOCAL, 

420
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,745
STATE FORCES, AND, OF COURSE, 

421
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,312
FEMA AND THE ADMINISTRATOR 

422
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,580
BROCK LONG. 

423
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,115

426
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,319
I BELIEVE DURING HER CAME IRMA 

427
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,889
WHICH WAS IN FLORIDA POSITIONED 

428
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,523
A LOT OF ASSETS OUTSIDE THE 

429
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,090
STORM AREA.  

430
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,827
LATER ON THEY WERE NEEDED AT 

431
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,028
ALL BECAUSE THE STATE ASSETS 

432
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:10,462
COULD HANDLE IT.  

433
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:11,196
AS WE LOOK AT THE STORM DO YOU 

434
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:13,198
FORESEE THAT THE GUARD WILL BE 

435
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:16,569
ABLE TO HANDLE SAR IMMEDIATELY 

436
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,137
AFTER THE STORM AND MAY NOT 

437
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:20,139
EVEN REQUIRE YOUR ASSETS?  

438
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:25,978
>> ALL THE LOCAL NATIONAL GUARD

REQUIREMENT THAT THE MAGNITUDE 

441
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,082
OF THIS STORE MAY EXCEED THEIR 

442
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,252
CAPABILITY AND IF IT DOES WE 

443
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:34,920
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 

444
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,554
POSTURED AND READY TO RESPOND 

445
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,221
AT A MOMENTS NOTICE TO THAT.  

446
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:36,855
IF WE END UP WITH THIS FORCE 

447
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:41,493
THAT WE HAVE THAT IS NOT NEEDED 

448
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:42,027
BECAUSE EITHER THE STORM 

449
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:42,728
DOESN'T HAVE THE IMPACT THAT WE 

450
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,864
THINK IT MIGHT AND OR THE LOCAL 

451
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,031

00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:52,537
IS JUST FINE.  

455
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:53,238
THEN WE HAVE MET OUR MISSION.

465
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,989
PLAY IN THAT?  SPECIFICALLY THE 

466

467
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:18,297
CAN YOU DO TO HELP THEM IN THIS

IN THAT REGARD.  úWE SYNCHRONIZ 

474
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:29,541
WE WERE CLOSELY WITH FEMA AND 

475
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,644
THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES SO WE CAN 

476
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:33,078
ANTICIPATE THOSE.  

477
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:33,979

MULTIPLE THINGS WE ARE DOING IN 

554
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:01,726
ORDER TO DRIVE THAT TIME FROM 

555
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:02,594
REQUEST TO ACTUAL RESPONSE AND 

556
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,096
ACTION THAT I THINK WILL SET US 

557
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:08,000
UP FOR SUCCESS FOR THIS EVENT.  

558
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,667
>> CARL BABB, VOICE OF AMERICA. 

559
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,368
>>  THANK YOU.  

560
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:17,242
TWO QUESTIONS.  FIRST, WE HAVE 

561
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:17,909
LEARNED ABOUT SOME OF THE SHIPS 

562
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:18,610
THAT HAVE BEEN SWORD TEED OUT.  

563
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,244
WHAT OTHER EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN 

564
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,046
MOVED OUT OF THE AREA, PLAINS 

565
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,914
AND OTHER THINGS.  ABOUT HOW 

566
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:26,051
MUCH HAS THAT CAUSED TO MOVE 

567
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,619
THAT EQUIPMENT OUT FOR THE 

568
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:31,023
MILITARY?  MY SECOND QUESTION IS

569
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:37,563
ON THE SEARCH AND RESCUE TIMING

570
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,096
.  EVERY TIME THERE IS A 

571
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:38,664
HURRICANE, ESPECIALL IN THE 

572
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,298
CAROLINAS, THERE ARE PEOPLE ON 

573
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,533
THE OUTER BANKS THAT DO NOT 

574
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,134
LIKE TO LEAVE BECAUSE THERE'S 

575
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:42,801
ONLY ONE ROAD AND I FEEL LIKE 

576
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:47,139
IF THEY STAY THEY DON'T HAVE TO 

577
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:47,806
WORRY ABOUT TAKING A DAY TO GET 

578
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:48,039
BACK.  

579
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:48,673
CAN YOU TELL US HOW LONG YOU 

580
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:49,307
ANTICIPATE IT WILL TAKE TO GET 

581
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:53,445
TO PEOPLE IF THEY BECOME, GET 

582
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,013
INTO A DIRE SITUATION?  

583
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,649
>> FIRST, LET ME START, ALL OF 

584
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,918
THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE CITIZENS

585
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,120
SHOULD LISTEN TO THEIR 

586
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,856
APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT LISTEN 

587
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,955
TO THE GUIDANCE THEY HAVE BEEN 

588
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:07,058
GIVEN IN RESPECT TO 

589
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:07,392
EVACUATIONS.  

590
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:08,327
THIS PARTICULAR STORM WILL BE 

591
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:13,964
CHALLENGING IN REGARDS OF WHAT 

592
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:14,365
YOU MENTIONED.  

593
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:14,933
BECAUSE OF THE SLOW-MOVING 

594
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:15,532
NATURE OF THE STORM IT COULD 

595
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:16,166
VERY WELL STAY WITH HIGH WIND, 

596
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:16,768
INCLEMENT WEATHER FOR A LONG 

597
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:19,070
TIME.  THAT WILL ME THAT ANY 

598
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,505
RESCUE EFFORT IS GOING TO TAKE 

599
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:20,738
TIME.  

600
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:23,308
WE STILL HAVE THE LIMITATIONS 

601
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,476
THAT WE HAVE OF OPERATING WITHIN

602
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,445
THOSE WEATHER ENVIRONMENTS THAT 

603
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:27,945
WILL PRECLUDE US FROM 

604
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:30,715
NECESSARILY COMING IN IN THE 

605
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:31,717
HOURS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE 

606
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,118
STORM HITS.  AGAIN, I WOULD 

607
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:37,256
REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED 

608
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:37,890
BASED ON THE NATURE OF THIS 

609
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,258
PARTICULAR STORM TO HEED THE 

610
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,492
EVACUATION RECOMMENDATIONS.  

611
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:52,804
WITH RESPECT -- IT IS WEATHER 

612
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:53,104
DEPENDENT.  

613
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:53,705
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT PART IS 

614
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:54,372
UNDER -- OUT OF OUR CONTROL.  

615
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:55,006
AS SOON AS THE WEATHER ALLOWS 

616
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:55,640
US TO WE WILL BE ABLE TO 

617
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,174
RESPOND VERY QUICKLY.  

618
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:56,841
WITH RESPECT TO THE MOVEMENT OF 

619
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:57,508
THE FORCE, OF COURSE, WE HAVE 

620
00:17:57,508 --> 00:17:58,977
TO MOVE THE FORCE TO PRESERVE 

621
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,347
THE FORCE.  

622
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,081
IT IS PRUDENT FOR US TO DO SO.  

623
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:03,748
I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT COST OF 

624
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:10,556
WHAT THAT IS.  

625
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,156
WE CAN GIVE YOU A FOLLOW-UP 

626
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:11,623
ANSWER ON THAT.  

627
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:12,291
OBVIOUSLY, IT IS PRUDENT FOR US 

628
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:12,958
TO MOVE IT AS OPPOSED TO HAVE 

629
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:13,525
IT DAMAGED BY THE STORM.  

630
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:19,331
>> TOM BOWMAN, NPR. 

631
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,032
>>  THE MARINES HAVE APPARENTLY 

632
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:20,932
DECIDED TO STAY AT CAMP LEJEUNE 

633
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:21,600
AND WILL BE IN THE MIDDLE OF 

634
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,704
THIS STORM SURGE.  

635
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:26,304
ARE THE PART OF THE RESCUE 

636
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:26,938
EFFORT OR WILL THEY HAVE TO 

637
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:27,505
FIND THEIR OWN WAY OUT IF 

638
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:28,440
THINGS GET REALLY BAD?  

639
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:35,847
TWO, IN A SENSE OF GETTING THE 

640
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:36,481
HOSPITAL SHIP COMFORT UNDERWAY 

641
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:37,149
AND HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE IT 

642
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:37,482
NECESSARY?  

643
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:38,083
>> FIRST, WE HAVE TRUST AND 

644
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,318
CONFIDENCE IN OUR INSTALLATION 

645
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,752
COMMANDERS AND THE DECISIONS 

646
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,889
THEY MAKE RELATIVE TO 

647
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:44,889
EVACUATION OR NOT EVACUATION.  

648
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:46,859
WE HAVE FAITH THAT IS THE RIGHT 

649
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,660
DECISION TO MAKE.  WE WILL 

650
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,764
STANDBY READY TO SUPPORT THEM.  

651
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:53,932
ON A POSITIVE SIDE, BECAUSE OF 

652
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:58,370
THEIR PROXIMITY AND THEIR GREAT 

653
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:58,970
CAPABILITY THAT WILL ALSO BE 

654
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,638
PART OF THE RELIEF EFFORTS THAT 

655
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,606
WE CAN BRING TO BEAR VERY 

656
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,340
QUICKLY.  

657
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,573
THEY WILL HELP IN THE EFFORT AS 

658
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:06,178
WELL.  

659
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:06,812
WE ARE FULLY COORDINATED WITH 

660
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,045
HIM.  

661
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:07,646
WE UNDERSTAND THE CAPABILITY 

662
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,313
CAPACITY THAT THEY HAVE AND WE 

663
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:08,980
ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO FIND 

664
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,415
WHEN THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BE 

665
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:14,919
PART OF THAT RESPONSE.  

666
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:15,653
>> I JUST HAD A NOTE FOR THAT.  

667
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:16,320
ALL DOD INSTALLATION COMMANDERS 

668
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,322
HAVE WHAT WE CALL IMMEDIATE 

669
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,923
RESPONSE AUTHORITIES.  

670
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:21,126
IF THERE ARE LIFE-THREATENING 

671
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,461
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE VICINITY, 

672
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:24,595
IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY ARE 

673
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:28,099
IN THEY HAVE PREAUTHORIZATION 

674
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:28,966
TO PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT TO 

675
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:31,202
THAT.  AND NUMBER OF THESE 

676
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:34,907
INSTALLATIONS ALSO HAVE MUTUAL 

677
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,074
AID AGREEMENTS WITH STATE AND 

678
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,342
LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  

679
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:43,215
THAT JUST MAKES MORE CLEAR AND 

680
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:43,849
THEY HAVE DONE SOME PREPLANNING 

681
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,516
ABOUT THE TYPES OF CAPABILITIES 

682
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,885
THAT THEY WOULD PROVIDE.  

683
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:47,485
AGAIN, IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE 

684
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:48,052
THERE ARE THREATS TO THE 

685
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:48,554
COMMUNITY. 

686
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,454
>>  I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS 

687
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,390
OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT THE 

688
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,725

DONE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO IN 

691
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:57,996
THIS EFFORT.  

692

OF COURSE, WE WANT TO MARRY UP 

693
00:19:58,696 --> 00:19:59,697

AUTHORITIES AT THIS TIME WE 

700
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:15,046
JUST DON'T THINK THAT CAPABILITY

701
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:15,813
IS NEEDED AT THIS TIME BASED ON 

702
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:16,481
THE ROBUST CAPABILITY WE HAVE 

703
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,115
