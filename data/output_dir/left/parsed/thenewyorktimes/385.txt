White nationalists
and counter-protesters
blamed each other for
the violence that erupted
in Charlottesville on Saturday.
"We have declared an
unlawful assembly."
Protesters also
blamed the police
for not keeping the peace.
Amateur video from many angles
over the course of the day
paints a picture of how
events turned violent.
Early Saturday morning,
white supremacists
gathered at McIntire
Park in Charlottesville.
Around the same time,
counterprotesters
met at a church 2.5 miles away.
Both groups march
toward Emancipation Park
in downtown
Charlottesville, the site
of the planned far-right rally.
"Let it shine.
Let it shine."
Several men wearing National
Guard-style military gear
were present.

before 11 a.m.
The use of pepper
spray was reported.

when officials declared
unlawful assembly.
Police started making
arrests around 11:55 a.m.
as they began clearing
Emancipation Park.
At 12:30 p.m.,
clashes were reported
at nearby Justice Park.
Counterprotesters marched
down Fourth Street.
At 1:40 p.m., a car
sped down Fourth Street.
Then it rushed in reverse.
"Did you guys just see that?
A car just plowed through
hundreds of people downtown
Charlottesville.
Holy .
We need the ambulances."
James Alex Fields Jr.
