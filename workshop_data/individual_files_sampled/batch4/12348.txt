women around the world continue to express their solidarity with the women's marches here in the West Jihan a Yazidi woman in Iraq told reporters quote I stood up and cheered when Scarlett Johansson highlighted the terrible injustice that Hollywood actresses are paid fewer millions than Hollywood actors simply because they don't draw as large an audience or at least I would have stood up and cheered if I hadn't been chained to the wall of the house where I'm being held as a sex slave by the same Islamist who slaughtered my children of my husband I was feeling pretty bad about that I admit but now I realize it is nothing compared to the plate plight of American actresses women in Los Angeles may look wealthy and coddled and privileged and whiny and self-obsessed and narcissistic and self-obsessed and coddled and privileged and whiny but who am I to judge after all I'm just a sex slave unquote in Yemen housewife thana Noel told reporters how she reacted to Ashlee Judds I'm a nasty woman speech saying quote I swear to Allah I would have applauded this nasty actress if my husband would not have beaten me for disturbing him how terrible it is that Ashley Judd must have her period which stains her favorite underwear I fear this will even be a problem for me when I start to have my period which might come as early as when I turn 12 also my heart bleeds for America's mistreatment of homosexuals by those who disapprove of them which is almost like the Nazi Holocaust except it leaves the homosexuals alive which of course we would never do unquote finally Saudi housewife heesu Malik says she was inspired by the fact that the co-leader of the Woman's March was Palestinian American radical Linda Sarsour who believes in bringing Sharia law to America mrs. Malik said quote Linda Sarsour has proudly proclaimed that we women here in Saudi Arabia get ten weeks paid maternity leave I have certainly had a lot of time to reflect on how lucky we are since I am serving a year in prison for posting online pictures of my husband raping our maid this of course defamed my husband terribly by showing everyone the rape he was committing in the privacy of his own home I am so glad women's March leader Linda saucer is seeking to bring Sharia to America because all those inspiring women in pussy hats would then be arrested as they deserve really it would drive me crazy not to have Sharia if I were allowed to drive unquote of course the women's March didn't just inspire women when female marchers bared their breasts and dressed up his gigantic vaginas it also inspired many thirteen-year-old boys who already believe who already believed women are gigantic vaginas with bared breasts but were afraid that was just some stupid adolescent fantasy they were having until the women's March proved that no on the left it's reality shrine I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show I guess I guess illustrations stuck talking that last one really cracked me alright tomorrow is the mailbag I should let you know hey hey and so you've got to subscribe to the daily wire.com for a lousy 8 bucks a month you get to ask your questions we will answer questions they are now guaranteed a hundred percent correct we've lost that little 0.3 percent or whatever it was of error we're now getting them all right and they will change your life entirely some of sometimes for the better also I should mention it's January 31st which means as we all know that this is the last day you can get my memoir on Kindle the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ is I think $2.99 for one day only one more day only so you can buy it now all right back into the world of complete chaos and craziness from our little island our little floating orbiting island of sanity here on the Andrew Clavin show it's like we're it's like we're kind of going around the earth and we see the fires and the flames but we're fine everything's fine here so we got to start with the news well let's start with the news Sally Yates the acting Attorney General until the Jeff Sessions is nominated would not enforce Trump's order she Trump's immigration order the temporary ban on accepting refugees seven countries Muslim majority countries were were cited and she says she sent out a note saying at present I am not convinced that the defence of the executive order is consistent with the Justice Department's responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful for as long as I am the attack acting the Attorney General the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the executive order unless until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so the Act the important phrase there is for as long as I am the attack acting the Attorney General which was very long because here was Trump's response I could I couldn't resist we have to use that right I mean you can't let they go so now there's a new guy Dana J boy Entei the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia has taken her place first thing he did was worse in that order here's Trump's statement firing her I love this statement it's classic Donald Trump you know he said the acting Attorney General Sally Yates has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States mr. Yates is an Obama administration appointee who was weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration at least we know he's writing his own stuff you know it's time to get serious about protecting our country calling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven dangerous places is not extreme it is reasonable and necessary to protect our country so not only you know she shouldn't have been there in the first place he should have gotten rid of her before she's an Obama appointee he was so easy this this kind of heroism is so easy she's in the wrong Trump is in the right there's no question about this I mean just imagine well let's let Alan Dershowitz the law professor he explained this well Sally AIDS is a terrific public servant but I think she's made a serious mistake here this is a holdover heroism it's so easy to be a herald heroine when you're not appointed by this president when you're on the other side she made a serious mistake I think what she should have done is done a nuanced analysis of what parts of the order are constitutional what parts are in violation of the statute what parts are perfectly lawful there's an enormous distinction between green card holders on the one hand people who are in the country and have to be thrown out on the second hand and people who are simply applying to get visas there is also a distinct I mean what's constitutional what's statutorily prohibited what's bad policy this is very bad policy yeah but what's lawful and I think by lumping all of them together she has made a political decision rather than a legal one see that's that's exactly right I mean you know they there's a lot of people playing this tape of Jeff Sessions questioning Yates and saying would you be willing to stand up to the President and of course the Attorney General does have to stand up to the president when she thinks the president is doing something illegal but that is not the case and what darshan would said is there may have been illegal parts of this or mistaken parts of this she could have struck you know stood up on but she just stood up on the whole thing that was a political decision also this idea going around that this is like Nixon Saturday night Massacre is nonsense I mean Nixon wanted to fire he wanted to fire the special prosecutor Archibald Cox who was investigating him and the Attorney General refused to do it and quit he said I cannot do this so I quit which would be the that would be a thing of integrity to do say if Sally eighths had done that nobody could argue with her but what she did was showboating it was ridiculous and then somebody else fired and finally was Bork I think who fired Archibald Cox and they got him back for it when they kept him off the Supreme Court so I mean this is just like if Jeff Sessions got appointed and he said you know abortion law is in violation of the right to life you know the right to life is in our founding documents and so there yes the Supreme Court said that you know the abortion is a human right but I'm not going to enforce that we're not enforcing that anymore and if any state violates that we're not you know we ridiculous you would have to get rid of these just not that's would be a political decision but what I want to talk about a little bit is the the atmosphere in the press there's been that the press is trying to create why they are trying to create this the New York Times a former newspaper reports on this firing and they said they their leaders in an escalating crisis for as 10-day old administration and if you read the front page of the New York Times this is all it is shock waves and immigrant communities foreign leaders asked can we trust Trump here are headlines from here's a headline from USA Today sessions faces Senate vote as Trump throws DOJ into chaos from 538 politics podcast chaos at the White House Business Insider a presidency in chaos legendary investigative journalist that's Bernstein who's a live CNN trump move leads to confusion and chaos there's chaos everywhere it's just a credible chaos and and of course Obama after 10 days of keeping his mouth shut you know I could for a while I couldn't even remember who the last president was you know I kept saying I remember he was like this tall thin guy I can't you know his name I think I was getting a little bit upset about this because Trump has done so much in these 10 days that it's really easy to just forget Obama really remember Obama accomplished nothing he accompanied be passed like one law he passed fewer laws than any president in history and all he did was these executive orders so yeah Trump hasn't done there haven't been any legislation in the first ten days here either but it does have this appearance of really getting down to work and treating this like a job so Obama had his guys sent out a statement President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country so he loves the protest right citizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake Obama fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion which this order does not do but we'll get back to this in a minute and this by the way is from the guy who pulled out of Iraq so letting Isis explode who stood there with his hand up his fundament well well well the Syria exploded into civil war he took like very until the last year he took very very few of the refugees in a situation he helped create create while half a million people died Trump has as part of his executive order he is trying to create safe spaces in Syria and in in Muslim controlled countries it's a completely reasonable thing to do and and talking about the escalating crisis and the chaos here is from Rasmussen most voters approve of president Trump's temporary halt the refugees and visitors from several Middle Eastern and African countries until the government can do a better job of keeping out individuals who are terrorist threat I mean that's its basic common sense in New Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 57 percent 57 percent of likely u.s. voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria Iraq Iran Libya Somalia Sudan and Yemen until the federal government approves its ability to screen out potential terrorists 33 percent are opposed so 1/3 so 57 percent that's that you know in America that's a big percentage that's a lot of people who agree okay so let's let's stop for a minute and just judge of the chaos where is this chaos coming from is there chaos I mean it doesn't sound like this K as if the president does something that 57% of the people approve of but but we do have to admit this how can i brothers it was not smoothly done I think I think we can say you know one of the things about Trump is he's a rude guy he's a blustering rude loudmouth guy and we like that when he's taking it out on the press and the people who have hogtied conservatives in our government with political correctness with unfair coverage with a blanket one-party state you know a vision of what's going on and so the Republicans are like shattered people they're like trembling traumatized children who are so afraid of opening their mouths even when the voters support them because they know the press and their donors are gonna come after them okay so we like Trump because he breaks through that he said you know you press you're the most dishonest people you lie you lie all the stuff great stuff it's great stuff but when you're doing something that's controversial sometimes it takes a little a little panache a little style and you didn't have it here's Krauthammer describing why this was such a disaster I mean it is utterly ridiculous first of all to give no guidance as to what you do with somebody holding a green card then you change the guidance you should have stated from the beginning if you have a green card decision you're not going to be stopped they were stopped that should never have happened so then what is it it's not only that they rushed it they did it in a terrible way in theory of course you want to have a strengthened vetting process a new administration should have the chance to review procedures but you don't announce that you're gonna all of a sudden have a new process and stop everybody who's already flying already in the air with a viola de visa and stop them when they land I mean the thing is the head of the Department of Homeland Security was basically having a in a plane I think having a conversation about this executive order when he looked up and saw Trump on TV executive order you know a little bit of chaos from the administration no question about it a little bit of you know incompetence you know my thing about this though is like if Trump if Trump violates our basic freedoms if he goes against the Constitution if he does things as president that I would have screamed if Obama did them because they are tyrannical and not in keeping with the separation of powers and all the stuff then the argument that oh you know the press said this about Obama and now they're being unfair then that argument doesn't hold water it doesn't always hold water to just compare Trump to let Trump off the hook just because the press is unfair to them but in the question of competence after 10 days in office you know I don't know I'm a little
