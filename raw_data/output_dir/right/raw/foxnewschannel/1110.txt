1
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:03,827
WE COULD GO ON, BUT IT'S

2
00:00:03,827 --> 00:00:05,028
DISGUSTING.

3
00:00:05,028 --> 00:00:06,029
HE GOES TO PRISON FOR NINE

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:06,830
MONTHS.

5
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,832
IT'S A GOOD THING HE DIDN'T

6
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:10,434
QUESTION DIVERSELY BECAUSE THEN

7
00:00:10,434 --> 00:00:12,436
HE'D BE IN REAL TROUBLE.

8
00:00:12,436 --> 00:00:13,704
WE HAVE TOLD YOU ON THE SHOW A

9
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:15,839
COUPLE OF TIMES ABOUT DECLINING

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,476
STANDARDS AT THE FAA, PLIGHT OF

11
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:20,644
PART OF THE WIDER WAR ON

12
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:21,845
STANDARDS.

13
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:24,047
IN THE NAME OF DIVERSITY, THE

14
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:26,349
FAA HAS ADDED AN IRRELEVANT

15
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:28,185
BIOGRAPHICAL SECTION TO ITS

16
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:30,821
HIRING PROCESS FOR AIR-TRAFFIC

17
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:32,322
CONTROLLERS.

18
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:34,024
CONGRESS COULD INTERVENE AND

19
00:00:34,024 --> 00:00:36,026
DICTATE THAT HIRING BE SOLELY

20
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:37,127
BASED ON QUALIFICATIONS.

21
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:40,597
WE HOPE THAT HAPPENS AND SO DOES

22
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:47,904
CHAIRMAN FRANK KOLBE ANDO.

23
00:00:47,904 --> 00:00:52,642
SO AS YOU ALREADY KNOW, THE FAA

24
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:53,610
INTENTIONALLY SEEKS OUT

25
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,045
UNQUALIFIED AIR TRAFFIC

26
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:55,712
CONTROLLERS WHICH IS WHOLE

27
00:00:55,712 --> 00:00:56,246
HORRIFYING.

28
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:57,814
WHAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

29
00:00:57,814 --> 00:01:00,617
FIGURE OUT IS WHO IS RESPONSIBLE

30
00:01:00,617 --> 00:01:01,284
FOR THIS?

31
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:02,986
>> FIRST, THANK YOU FOR RAISING

32
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:03,386
THIS AGAIN.

33
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:04,587
IT WAS YOUR NETWORK WHO FIRST

34
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:06,056
RAISED IT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

35
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:08,692
AND GAVE US THE ABILITY TO GET

36
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:11,228
SOME TRACTION, BUT UNFORTUNATELY

37
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:13,230
UNFORTUNATELY IT GOT SHOT IN THE

38
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,631
DOOR.

39
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:16,032
WE WERE BLINDSIDED.

40
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,033
UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

41
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,703
AND THE FAA ADMINISTRATOR AT THE

42
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:20,837
TIME, MICHAEL WIRT, NORMALLY

43
00:01:20,837 --> 00:01:22,105
THEY COME TO CONGRESS AND SAY,

44
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:24,508
WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE

45
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:25,475
PROCEDURES.

46
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:27,711
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE,

47
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:29,513
AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROLLER

48
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:29,913
QUALIFYING.

49
00:01:29,913 --> 00:01:32,048
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

50
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:33,650
NOTHING, JUST DID IT AND

51
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,618
BLINDSIDED US.

52
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:36,453
WE STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS, WHY

53
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:38,021
DID YOU DO IT?

54
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:38,755
DID YOU CHECK THIS BIOGRAPHICAL

55
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:41,291
APP TO MAKE SURE IT WAS GOING TO

56
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,859
WORK?

57
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:43,460
NOTHING, SILENCE.

58
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,262
WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING THIS FOR A

59
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:46,730
COUPLE OF YEARS, WITHOUT GETTING

60
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,831
ANY ANSWERS AND ANY EXPLANATION

61
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:50,867
AS TO WHY COME UP WITH A TOTAL

62
00:01:50,867 --> 00:02:01,178
BLINDSIDE.

63
00:02:11,688 --> 00:02:12,289
WE HAD THE DEPARTMENT OF

64
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:13,023
TRANSPORTATION INSPECTOR GENERAL

65
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:13,390
INVOLVED.

66
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:13,957
WE HAVE THE GOVERNMENT

67
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:14,691
ACCOUNTING OFFICE INVOLVED, AND

68
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:15,425
IT YOU HAD A VERY ABLE GUEST ON,

69
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:16,159
MICHAEL PEARSON, WHO HAS DONE A

70
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:16,526
GREAT JOB.

71
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:17,260
BUT BECAUSE OF THE LAWSUIT, BOTH

72
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:17,928
OF THESE AGENCIES SHUT DOWN.

73
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:18,628
SO WHAT WAS THE MOST EGREGIOUS

74
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:19,062
PART OF THIS?

75
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:19,763
WE HAVE ALREADY ATTEMPTED AND

76
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:20,463
ADDRESSED, AND THAT IS THE CTI

77
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:20,831
STUDENTS.

78
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:23,266
THAT'S HOW IT FIRST CAME TO ME.

79
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:23,967
>> Tucker: THEY INTENTIONALLY

80
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:25,869
GO TO SCHOOL TO BE AIR-TRAFFIC

81
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:26,269
CONTROLLERS.

82
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:29,072
>> THEY HAVE THE APTITUDE AND

83
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:30,907
PAY TENS OF THOUSANDS TO DO

84
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:31,508
THIS.

85
00:02:31,508 --> 00:02:32,809
IT'S AMAZING, AND THEY HAVE THE

86
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:34,945
RUG PULLED OUT FROM UNDER THEM.

87
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:36,947
THEY WERE TOTALLY QUALIFIED AND

88
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:39,416
TOLD HER, SORRY.

89
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:48,225
>> SO IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT

90
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:49,726
SHOULD THAT DEFENDS IT?

91
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:51,061
>> I DOUBT IT.

92
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:52,863
>> Tucker: SO WHY SHOULDN'T

93
00:02:52,863 --> 00:02:53,463
CONGRESS PASSED IN ITS

94
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:54,164
AUTHORIZATION FOR FUNDING FOR

95
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:58,068
THE FAA A RULE THAT SAYS YOU

96
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:00,437
CANNOT USE IRRELEVANT CRITERIA

97
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:01,438
FOR HIRING AIR-TRAFFIC

98
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:01,838
CONTROLLERS?

99
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:03,306
IT'S TOO IMPORTANT.

100
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:04,241
COULD WE DO THAT?

101
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:05,842
>> IF I WERE WRITING A BILL AND

102
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:07,410
WERE ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT THE

103
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,311
CONSENT OF OUR SENATE AND ABLE

104
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:11,615
TO DO IT THROUGH OUR COMMITTEE,

105
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:12,816
I WOULD DO IT.

106
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:13,850
>> Tucker: NEED TO HIRE

107
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,052
UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE WHO ARE BAD AT

108
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:16,386
SCIENCE.

109
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,088
>> THEY WON'T PUT IT THAT WAY,

110
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:22,025
BUT YOU KNOW THE WAY IT WORKS.

111
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:25,295
IT HAS TO GO TO CONFERENCE AND

112
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:27,864
THE SENATE GETS INVOLVED AND IT

113
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:28,431
GETS MOCKED UP.

114
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:30,634
>> Tucker: DO YOU THINK THEY

115
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:33,470
UNDERSTAND -- THESE ARE

116
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,237
AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS.

117
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:36,006
>> PEOPLE AREN'T PAYING

118
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:36,506
ATTENTION TO IT.

119
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:38,408
BUT WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO POINT

120
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:40,477
OUT IS THAT THE CTI STUDENTS,

121
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:44,314
AND MAY BE MOST EGREGIOUSLY,

122
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:45,282
MILITARY, A FORMER MILITARY,

123
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:46,483
ESPECIALLY MILITARY AIR TRAFFIC

124
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:49,619
CONTROLLERS ARE NOW INTO THE MIX

125
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:49,920
AGAIN.

126
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,620
>> Tucker: IT'S GOOD TO COME

127
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,422
UP BUT IF THERE IS A SINGLE

128
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:53,223
PERSON WHO IS UNQUALIFIED AND

129
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:55,458
HIRED FOR THIS JOB AGAIN, THIS

130
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:59,329
IS NOT TO BECOME A GYM TEACHER.

131
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:01,965
THESE ARE AIR-TRAFFIC

132
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:02,365
CONTROLLERS.

133
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:03,266
>> AND THIS IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO

134
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,067
KNOW.

135
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:05,468
IF ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO MAYBE

136
00:04:05,468 --> 00:04:07,304
DOESN'T BELONG THERE GETS

137
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:08,972
THROUGH THE INITIAL PROCESS,

138
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:11,841
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

139
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:13,276
ACADEMY, AND THEY ARE WASHED OUT

140
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:17,613
BECAUSE THE ACADEMY PUTS UP WITH

141
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:19,849
NO NONSENSE.

142
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:22,852
>> Tucker: THERE ARE MORE

143
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:24,220
THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR

144
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,055
BUREAUCRACY.

145
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:28,124
AND YOU ARE GRADED ON IRRELEVANT

146
00:04:28,124 --> 00:00:00,000
CRITERIA, AND SO, IT'S WRONG.
