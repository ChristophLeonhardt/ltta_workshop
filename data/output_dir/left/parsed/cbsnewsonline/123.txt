HAPPENED IN SYRIA RECENTLY. 
I THINK HE KNOWS IT BETTER THAN 
THE MEDIA. 
HE UNDERSTANDS IT AND IS NOT 
HAPPY ABOUT IT. 
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A PRESIDENT 
AS TOUGH ON RUSSIA AS I HAVE 
BEEN. 
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> DO YOU BELIEVE--[INAUDIBLE 
QUESTIONS] 
>> WE'RE FINISHED. 
LET'S GO. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> COME ON KEEP MOVING. 
LET'S GO. 
>> YOU COULD HEAR REPORTERS 
TRYING TO ASK THE PRESIDENT A 
FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT--THE 
PRESIDENT NOT AMUSED ABOUT 
WHETHER OR NOT HE BELIEVES 
VLADIMIR PUTIN DID NOT MEDEL IN 
THE ELECTION. 
THE PRESIDENT NOT ANSWERING 
THAT REITERATING THE IDEA AND 
ASSERTION HE'S BEEN TOUGHER ON 
RUSSIA THAN ANY OTHER 
PRESIDENT. 
WEIJIA JANG JOINS ME NOW. 
WEIJIA, YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY WE 
HAVE WEIJIA THERE. 
DO WE HAVE YOU THERE? 
>> YOU SURE DO. 
>> OKAY GREAT. 
WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 
BACKTRACK SAYING HE MISSPOKE 
YESTERDAY. 
BUT THEN YOU KNOW THIS MORNING 
HE'S BEEN TWEETING. 
HE'S BEEN PUSHING BACK AGAINST 
HIS CRITICS. 
HE HAS GONE ON THE RECORD AGAIN 
TWEETING THAT HIS CRITICS HATE 
THE FACT HE'S GOTTEN ALONG SO 
WELL WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AND 
SAYING THEY SUFFER FROM WHAT HE 
CALLS TRUMP DERANGEMENT 
SYNDROME. 
I GUESS WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE 
WITH THE PRESIDENT A TENDENCY 
TO AT TIMES APOLOGIZE OR 
BACKTRACK AND THEN KIND OF 
CIRCLE BACK AROUND AGAIN TO 
WHAT HE ORIGINALLY SAID. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S 
EXACTLY WHAT HE AS DONE HERE 
EVEN THOUGH WE SAW THAT 
REVERSAL YESTERDAY, HE HAS 
FOCUSED ON WHAT HE WANTS TO 
TALK ABOUT WHICH IS HIS BELIEF 
THAT THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY 
SUCCESSFUL MEETING. 
YOU HEARD HIM RIGHT THERE 
SAYING NO ONE ELSE HAS BEEN AS 
TOUGH ON RUSSIA THAN HIM. 
NO ONE IS GOING TO DISAGREE 
ENGAGEMENT WITH RUSSIA IS 
IMPORTANT. 
IT IS THE QUALITY OF THAT 
ENGAGEMENT THAT MATTERS AND SO 
FAR WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF 
THE QUALITY JUDGED ON SUBSTANCE 
IT IS VERY LITTLE SO IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO DRAW A CONCLUSION 
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS THAT IT 
WAS SUCH A VICK TOROUS SUMMIT. 
IN FACT ANNE-MARIE THE RUSSIAN 
EMBASSY IN THE U.S. IS 
PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION THAN 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS. 
THEY ARE TWEETING OUT THAT THE 
RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY IS 
READY FOR THE PRACTICAL PLEDGES 
OF AGREEMENT IN THE AREA OF 
GLOBAL SECURITY REACHED BETWEEN 
THESE TWO PRESIDENTS. 
WHAT AGREEMENTS THEY ARE 
TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE NO IDEA. 
YOU KNOW, I WAS PRESSING WHITE 
HOUSE SOURCES TODAY ABOUT THIS 
TO RELEASE ANY SORT OF DETAIL 
ABOUT WHAT WAS AGREED UPON IN 
THAT ROOM BETWEEN PRESIDENTS 
TRUMP AND PUTIN. 
AND THERE ARE SO MANY AREAS 
THAT THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS THAT 
HE HAS STARTED THE DIALOGUE 
ABOUT WHETHER IT'S SYRIA, NORTH 
KOREA. 
BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY 
DELIVERABLES. 
JOHN BOLTON, THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISOR ALONG WITH 
OTHER SENIOR ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS SET VERY LOW 
EXPECTATIONS IN TERMS OF THOSE 
DELIVERABLES. 
BUT NOW YOU HAVE RUSSIA 
CLAIMING THAT THEY ACTUALLY DID 
REACH AGREEMENTS WHETHER THEY 
ARE FORMAL, VERBAL, INFORMAL, 
WE DON'T KNOW BUT AGAIN THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF AND THE WHITE 
HOUSE HAS NOT GONE THAT FAR TO 
SAY THAT THEY ACTUALLY CAME TO 
TERMS WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THAT 
THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE WORKING 
ON AND HERE ARE THE NEXT STEPS 
TO GET THERE. 
WE DON'T HAVE THAT. 
ALL WE HAVE AT THIS POINT AS WE 
JUST HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT 
AT THE CABINET MEETING WAS THAT 
IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS. 
AND THAT'S THE FRUSTRATION 
HERE. 
IT'S NOT THAT, YOU KNOW--NOBODY 
IS ARGUING IT'S A BAD THING FOR 
HIM TO GET ALONG WITH PRESIDENT 
PUTIN AND HAVE THESE MEETINGS. 
AGAIN IT IS THE QUALITY OF THAT 
MEETING THAT MATTERS AND WE 
CANNOT TELL WHAT THAT QUALITY 
IS WITH JUST A BLANKET 
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT 
SAYING IT WAS GREAT. 
>> IT'S NOT JUST THAT. 
I MEAN THIS WOULDN'T BE THE 
FIRST TIME THE PRESIDENT GETS 
OUT IN FRONT OF HIS COMMUNITY 
STAFF BUT EARLIER TODAY HE 
TWEETED THIS MORNING THAT ONCE 
AGAIN MANY POSITIVE THINGS CAME 
OUT OF THAT MEETING INCLUDING 
RUSSIA HAS AGREED TO HELP WITH 
NORTH KOREA WHERE THE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH US IS VERY 
GOOD. 
THE PROCESS IS MOVING ALONG. 
WELL ONCE AGAIN WEIJIA WHAT DID 
THEY AGREE TO? 
AGREE TO HELP WITH THE 
DISMANTLING OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS? 
AGREE TO HELP WITH OTHER 
NEGOTIATIONS? 
THAT'S A HUGE DEAL. 
>> YEAH OF COURSE IT IS BUT THE 
PROBLEM IS THAT NOW THERE'S A 
QUEUE. 
NOW WE HAVE TO PILE ON TO THESE 
DISCUSSIONS ON NORTH KOREA THAT 
HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN CLARIFIED 
BETWEEN KIM JONG-UN AND THIS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
THE PRESIDENT RECENTLY IN THE 
PAST DAY OR SO HAS SAID LOOK 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME 
TO DENUCLEARIZE AND I'M OKAY 
WITH THAT. 
EVEN THOUGH THE PROBLEM IS THEY 
SIGNED A JOINT STATEMENT AND WE 
SAW THEM TOGETHER AND THE 
PRESIDENT CLAIMED VICTORY THERE 
WE DO NOT HAVE THE SUBSTANCE 
AND THE PRESIDENT IS NOT 
CONCERNED OR IT SEEMS THAT HE'S 
NOT CONCERNED THAT NORTH KOREA 
HAS NOT PROVIDED ANY DETAILS 
ABOUT HOW IT PLANS TO 
DENUCLEARIZE. 
SO HOW RUSSIA IS GOING TO HELP 
IN THAT PROCESS, IT'S VERY 
DIFFICULT TO ANSWER BECAUSE WE 
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT 
PROCESS IS BECAUSE THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS NOT BEEN 
ABLE TO TELL THE AMERICAN 
PUBLIC WHAT KIND OF CONCRETE 
EVIDENCE THAT HE HAS THAT KIM 
JONG-UN IS ACTUALLY TAKING REAL 
STEPS TO DISMANTLE HIS WEAPONS 
THAT ALREADY EXIST. 
HE CONTINUES TO SAY THAT IT IS 
A GREAT SUCCESS BECAUSE NORTH 
KOREA IS NO LONGER TESTING 
WEAPONS AND DESTROYING TESTING 
SITES BUT THE QUESTION IS NO 
LONGER ABOUT TESTING MISSILES. 
IT'S ABOUT ALL OF THOSE WEAPONS 
IN THE EXISTING ARSENAL. 
HOW YOU ARE GOING TO LOCATE 
THEM, HOW YOU ARE GOING TO 
CONTROL THEM AND GET RID OF 
THEM. 
AND WE ARE STILL WAITING ON THE 
ANSWER FOR THAT SO AGAIN THIS 
SECOND PART OF THIS THAT NOW 
RUSSIA IS GOING TO ASSIST IN 
THAT PROCESS IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S 
WAY TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT 
RUSSIA'S ROLE WHEN YOU HAVE NOT 
EVEN RECEIVED ANY FIRM 
INFORMATION AND COMMITMENTS 
FROM NORTH KOREA. 
>> RIGHT INDEED. 
I WANT TO QUICKLY PIVOT BACK TO 
THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 
CORRECTING HIMSELF SAYING THAT 
DURING THAT PRESS CONFERENCE HE 
MEANT TO SAY THE WORD WOULDN'T 
INSTEAD OF WOULD. 
WHICH DIDN'T REALLY SORT OF 
OFFER ANY MORE CLARITY BUT WE 
JUST SAW HIM IN HIS CABINET 
MEETING AND REPORTERS WERE 
YELLING OUT A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 
I'M TOLD NEAR THE END A 
REPORTER ASKED WHETHER OR NOT 
RUSSIA WAS STILL TARGETING THE 
U.S. AND LOOKED LIKE HE SHOOK 
HIS HEAD AND SAID NO. 
HE COULD HAVE BEEN SHAKING HIS 
HEAD IN GENERAL LIKE NO SORT OF 
USHERING EVERYONE OUT I'M NOT 
ANSWERING THE QUESTION. 
DO WE HAVE ANY SORT OF FIRM 
CLARITY ABOUT WHAT THIS 
PRESIDENT BELIEVES? 
DOES HE BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA IS 
STILL TARGETING THE U.S. IN 
REGARDS TO OUR UP COMING 
ELECTION? 
>> AT THIS POINT, WE CAN ONLY 
LOOK AT WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
SAID AND IT IS SUBSTANTIAL 
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS 
FOR THE FIRST TIME YESTERDAY 
WHEN HE SAID THAT HE ACCEPTS 
THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY'S CONCLUSION THAT 
THERE WAS RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE. 
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WAS THE 
FIRST TIME HE MADE THE 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN 
INTERFERENCE AND COLLUSION. 
AROUND THAT IS AN IMPORTANT 
DISTINCTION BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD 
HIM SO MANY TIMES SAY THAT THE 
COLLUSION IS A WITCH HUNT BUT 
HE HAS CONFLATED THE TWO. 
AND SO HE HASN'T REALLY COME 
OUT AND BEEN FIRM ABOUT WHETHER 
HE BELIEVES THE EVIDENCE ABOUT 
RUSSIAN MEDDLING AND FOR THE 
FIRST TIME REALLY YESTERDAY HE 
SAID I DO BELIEVE IT. 
I ACCEPT IT. 
WE'VE HEARD HIM IN THE PAST SAY 
I THINK IT WAS RUSSIA. 
IT MAY HAVE BEEN RUSSIA. 
BUT EVEN YESTERDAY AFTER HE 
SAID I ACCEPT THE CONCLUSION IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN OTHER PEOPLE. 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE 
ELSE. 
AND SO THERE'S ALWAYS A FOOT 
NOTE THAT GOES ALONG WITH A LOT 
OF THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKS 
INCLUDING THE ONE YESTERDAY 
THAT WAS MEANT TO SORT OF 
CLARIFY HIS STANCE BUT THAT 
STILL AND YOU MAKE A GREAT 
POINT IS FUZZY BECAUSE WHILE HE 
IS MAKING THIS DECLARATION HE'S 
ALSO FOLLOWING IT UP WITH 
SAYING OTHER PEOPLE MAY HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED TOO. 
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT 
REPORTERS HERE ARE COMPING AT 
THE BIT AND VERY EXCITED 
BECAUSE SARAH SANDERS IS HAVING 
A PRESS BRIEFING AT 2:00:00 
P.M. 
THIS IS OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY 
TO ASK HER THESE QUESTIONS 
AFTER THIS WHIRL WIND TRIP. 
AND SHE HAS A LOT TO ANSWER FOR 
NOT ONLY WHEN IT COMES TO 
MEDDLING BUT ALSO THE SUBSTANCE 
OF THE MEETING, THE AGREEMENTS, 
WHY THE PRESIDENT IS CLAIMING 
VICTORY SO I EXPECT IT WILL BE 
A VERY HEATED CONFERENCE TODAY. 
>> I BET IT WILL BE. 
WEIJIA JANG, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>> SURE. 
>>>  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT 
MORE NEWS BUT FOR NOW WE ARE 
GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
