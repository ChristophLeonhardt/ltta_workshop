CONFIRMATION FIGHT FOR JUDGE
BRETT KAVANAUGH.
DEMOCRATS ON THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE IN THE LAST HOUR
DEMANDING THAT THE FBI
INVESTIGATE ALL THREE
ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL
MISCONDUCT THE JUDGE IS NOW
FACING.
IN A LETTER TO THE FBI AND
THE WHITE HOUSE, FINAL OUT
OF 10 DEMOCRATS ON THE
COMMITTEE LISTED DOZENS OF
WITNESSES THEY WANT
INVESTIGATORS TO INTERVIEW.
AND JUST MOMENTS AGO SOURCES
TOLD OUR JOHN ROBERTS THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS GIVEN
FBI AGENTS THE GREEN LIGHT
TO INTERVIEW ANYBODY THEY
WANT, AS LONG AS THE
INVESTIGATION IS WRAPPED UP
BY FRIDAY.
THE PRESIDENT SPOKE ABOUT IT
EARLIER WITH REPORTERS.
>> I THINK THE FBI SHOULD DO
WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO GET
TO THE ANSWER.
I WANT IT TO BE
COMPREHENSIVE.
I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S A GOOD
THING FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD
THING.
NOT A BAD THING.
I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING.
THE REASON I WOULD LIKE IT
TO GO QUICKLY IT'S SO SIMPLE
IT'S UNFAIR TO HIM AT THIS
POINT.
WHAT HIS WIFE IS GOING
THROUGH, WHAT HIS BEAUTIFUL
CHILDREN ARE GOING THROUGH
IS NOT DESCRIBABLE.
>> Trace: HERE'S THE
QUALIFIER, PRESIDENT TRUMP
SAYS IT'S UP TO THE SENATE
TO DETERMINE WHAT A
COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION
WOULD BE, WOULD LOOK LIKE.
LAST WEEK HE TOLD
KAVANAUGH'S ACCUSER
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD A VERY
CREDIBLE WITNESS AND
DESCRIBED HER SENATE
TESTIMONY AS VERY
COMPELLING.
