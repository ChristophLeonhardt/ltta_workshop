we're gathered here tonight to witness
and today March and anti-gay protests
for tomorrow's Sunday 28 there is
scheduled a Pride Parade
the thing is that Gay Pride officially
is not announced yet we're waiting for
government officials to announce wedding
going to happen or not
well reads last gay pride march in 2010
resulted in a baby of anti-gay violence
across the city since then year by year
every proposed march has been cancelled
the world is cultivating sin justifying
it officially as LGBT these communities
reject the principle of the traditional
family and evil is now called virtue

so we went through the barricades we are
on the other side we've been standing
here for the last 5-6 hours the decision
has not been made yet we do not know
what went up next
the protesters failed to stop the March
from going ahead as a result the LGBT
community were allowed to march in
Belgrade for the first time in years
okay this is the official building
called government of Serbia and we are
here the parade
I'm very happy that it is finally
happening
I'm waiting this moment till I was a
little girl who found out she was gay
we would rather die here and now then be
oppressed all our lives
it's horrible to military are right they
are wrong we are right and they are
little show that we are right and that
we believe in our right and that they
are not going to scare us okay if this
goes well and everything shows and says
that it's going to go well I think we're
gonna have a opportunity to send a clear
message to a strong message to the whole
world

so this is the follow-up immediately of
the Pride Parade Asians have gathered in
the temple of saint sava and they
started marching to really clean the
city after the Pride Parade in the Sodom
and Gomorrha that happened a few hours
ago here so the parade was finally held
in peace there was no blood on the
streets of Belgrade as both anti-gay
protests and gay March ended without
violence memories of bloody clashes
during the 2010 parade probably made
many day away from the March while its
opponents have clearly shown that there
is no space for compromise
Oh
