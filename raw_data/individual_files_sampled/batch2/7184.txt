well we've been telling you a lot about strange weather events it's almost as if someone or a whole set of folks predicted this maybe a whole category of profession called scientists well we got hit by a hurricane after hurricane we got the droughts that led to the terrible wildfires in western United States and now we have what is being called an atmospheric River what in the world does that mean well you're about to see it is a 5,000 mile long belt of rain what in the world let me show to you it stretches from China to the United States it is a 5,000 mile belt of storms what have we done to the planet Jesus man they call you know they have these both cool and scary phrases for this it's also called rivers in the sky because it it it's so long and it's obviously rain and moisture in the air and so intense that it has formed a river in the sky oh my god what have we done so now there's not the first time that we've had this there was one back in 2009 it is not a sign of good things to come if we start to have these more frequently and more intensely I don't know how that it could get more intense that a 5,000 mile belt of storms but I it's this is picking up momentum and there's clutch yes climate change makes a difference yes they told you to the warm air would pick up moisture from both the ground causing droughts and wildfires and from the ocean and it would create bigger storms has a 5,000 mile storm for you another thing that scientists that are tracking this call this is the big dark because five thousand miles there's nothing but clouds in that a belt and it's the big dark and it is headed in our direction well it's an already hit walk the state of Washington let me tell you about that at least one city in Washington set a daily record for precipitation Wednesday and Seattle was expected to have its wettest 24 hour period since February think about that for a second it's not like the state of Washington isn't already wet it's known in America as the wettest area in America it rains all the time we just broke a record in the state of Washington for precipitation gee I wonder if there's something going on here I wonder if the scientists were all right that we are going to have more precipitation and more storms more from the state of Washington strong wind gusts knocked out power to more than 54,000 people in western Washington and a ground delay was temporarily placed at Seattle Tacoma International Airport according to King 5tv ferry services were temporarily closed as well look there's stories that I'm reading I don't know if they're afraid to make the connection will they seem non-neutral do they need to have 70s scientists on the record to talk about it but not a lot of talk of climate change I am not afraid to talk about it I and I can see it with my own eyes the scientists predicted that we would have massive storms now we have five thousand miles of storms the big dark and people are wondering oh well I'm you know that might be a shame if climate change happens later son you're in climate change you're in it right now what more do you need you need a 10,000 miles storm we had how many hurricanes hit Harvey Erma Maria and those are the ones that just happen to hit US territories and and then the wildfires that great that was range for months in Montana let alone the devastation they did in California and now the big dark yes its climate change not one storm is or the pattern can be can be directly connected and you say okay well it rained today it must be because of climate change no but overall when you look at the macro picture and you see the intensity of these storms it is exactly what was predicted in fact it is coming quicker heavier a much more intense than even scientists expected if you liked this video you probably like independent media the best way to support independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm / join
