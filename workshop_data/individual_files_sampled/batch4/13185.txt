Andrew Clavin thank you very much and thank you for coming and I do hope you'll stay for the question and answers especially if you disagree with me I'd like to hear from you I I always feel that it's only the people who want to control us who don't want us to disagree and talk to each other that they if they can keep us angry at one another they can work us and manipulate us and keep in power and I always feel that when we actually I talk to one another things get better we actually find out that we might not hate each other as much as we're supposed to speaking of which I'm very thankful to young America's Foundation for hosting this hosting me and for the young Americans for freedom but the young Americans foundation when they ask you to do a speech I think they pass out a question ear to conservatives and they ask them what they'd like to hear about and then they send you a suggested title for your speech you don't have to do it but it's their suggestion and that's title they sent me was culture wars why everything you know about Western civilization is wrong and I thought Jesus frickin belligerent you know it's like yeah these guys they look nice but that's very easy just like cause our wars you know everything you know is wrong and and I thought that's that's pretty much the state of our political discourse at this point you know it's like we're just kind of constantly screaming at each other never listening to each other so it's war and you're wrong and so I'm gonna be absolutely honest with you from where I stand as a conservative and where I see things but I again I do want to hear from you it is absolutely true if there are things that the left says that I don't understand at all like I don't get it I don't even know what they're talking about so just for instance I hear left wingers say things like there's no internal difference between men and women men and women are exactly the same and listen that's not my experience of life that's not what I've seen in my life but you're young people you can experiment with ideas and maybe it'll work out for you maybe it won't I don't mind that at all but the same people who say that to me the same people who say men and women are exactly the same well tell me that a transgender person is a woman in a man's body and I think well if they're the same how would you know how would you know you had a woman in your body if men and women are exactly the same and I just I don't get what they're talking about another one and I only do a couple because I don't want and I don't mean to be controversial I'm just telling you where I come from is you should respect all cultures I live in Hollywood there's a big billboard oh I think it's a jeans at I don't know what it is it's a jeans ad I think and it says respect all cultures and I think really you know do I have to do I have to do that I mean in the South in this country before the Civil War there was a culture that thought it was all right to hold human beings as slaves like I don't respect that culture and in Germany in the 40s they carted people off and killed them by the trainload I got no respect no one of us to say about that like well Beethoven was good but the carting people off to the gas chambers now you know I but I respect your culture I don't respect that culture yeah Saudi Arabia today's great things are happening in Saudi Arabia wonderful things this new crown prince's great guy I'm very excited about the stuff he's doing but still in Saudi Arabia a woman can't leave her house without asking permission from her nearest male relative even if it's her son how would you like know how would you like that little Tommy may I go outside I I don't respect that culture I think I think we all know we all know that there are things that are right things that are wrong and you don't have to respect people when they're doing what's wrong now on the conservative side I will say this because I I will criticize my own team and you'll have to forgive me a years of typing have left me with a damaged hand so don't don't worry if I if my hand trembles a little on the conservative side we have a tendency I think to see everything as the end of Western culture every change every liberalisation everything that turns around it's gonna be this is the end of Western had a guy good friend of mine good friend of mine not that long ago said we're sitting over dinner and he said to me you know if gay marriage becomes a reality that's going to be the end of Western civilization obviously you know cuz I thought was gonna be more like Cloverfield you know where something like some giant monster came and killed us all but now for him that's what it is I think I think conservatives do that a lot so here's what I want to talk about okay I know I know your professors tell you this and I know you hear it all the time but if you think Western culture is about race if you think it's about gender if you think it's about sexuality then everything you know about Western civilization actually is wrong because those are issues all around the world for everybody all the time there's really only one thing that is unique about Western culture and especially about American culture the thing that defines us as opposed to all the things that people do which are tearing up people do terrible things to one another but the idea that defines us is your happiness your happiness I mean this is in the Declaration they talked about you have the god-given right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and then it says something absolutely bizarre it says to secure those rights governments are instituted among men and the thing is that was never true until this country until the country you are in right this moment no government on earth had ever been instituted to secure the right to the pursuit of happiness I mean you know that you just you just think about it for a minute like in the first dynasty in Egypt when the Pharaoh died they used to kick kill his servants so he'd had servants in the afterlife I mean that to me does not sound like a government it was established to secure your happiness you know it's like come right this way servants we're gonna secure your right to happiness you know that it never happened before and there's a lot of debate where did Thomas Jefferson get this idea where did he get the idea person of the pursuit of happiness as a right that government was supposed to protect and some people say well it's in john locke the philosopher john locke but i just think they're missing the whole thing the pursuit of happiness has been central to Western culture from the very very beginning so let me give you my two-minute history of Western culture in order to really understand Western culture you have to understand that there are two men - don't call them heroes there tell moms is there anybody here knows where to tell them on it nobody knows what's all right okay in architecture there are pillars that hold things up and if they're carved in the shape of a woman they're called to carry outside and if they're carved in the shape of a man they're called the Telamon after a mythical figure is one of the Argonauts but I work in the movie business a lot and when you go on the Disney studio they have a building that has telephones that are shaped like the Seven Dwarves so you have like Rome it always struck me as kind of absurd but also kind of wonderful okay classic American the two telemon's of Western civilization the two men who hold up Western civilization at the very bottom are Socrates and Jesus a gay guy and a Jew this is what this is why by the way the left is right about inclusion you should always include people because you never know who's going to come up with the best idea it could be the gay guy in the Jew right and Socrates and Jesus had a lot of seriously important things in common first like you in this time they both lived in a time where the smartest most sophisticated people believed there was no such thing as truth that moral truth was relative you know you may remember if you read the Bible Pontius Pilate says to Jesus what is truth the obviously very sardonic question and both Socrates and Jesus believed there was such a thing as truth but you couldn't put it into words you couldn't quite say what it was so they both found a technique to move people to the truth Socrates who came first would go out into the square and he would hunt down young people because young people are the most certain of what they believe right as they know the least so they're the most certain and Socrates would ask some questions he would hammer them with questions until they started to think like and maybe I'm not so close to the truth as I thought I was and Jesus of course spoke in parables and did miracles and he said I am the truth I embody the truth which is a very profound concept and another thing they had in common is they were both murdered by the government largely you would have to say for hate speech and this is one of the reasons conservatives don't like hate speech right because you might be killing Socrates and Jesus right they were both killed for blasphemy for saying things that we're just beyond the pale just could not be tolerated and the third thing they had in common was that after they were murdered by the government they took over the Western world now Socrates took over the Western world because Socrates had a student named Plato and Plato has a student named Aristotle and Aristotle had a student and I really I sorry I don't I'm not gonna quiz you but I just want to know there's anybody know who Aristotle student was like you're a history are you okay you know good yes so happy that someone knew that yes Alexander the Great and Alexander the Great conquered a huge swath of the world and brought with him what was called Hellenic culture Greek culture that he had learned from Aristotle who had learned it from Plato had learned it from Socrates and this became the Hellenic world and Rome then conquered the Hellenic world and adopted Greek philosophy and Greek thought they're saying at the time was Rome conquered Greece and then Greece conquered Rome and of course Rome then became Christian and Rome conquered the Western world and it became the Roman Catholic Church which brought the thought of Aristotle and Socrates and Plato and Jesus and st. Paul brought them together into this one church usually people think it's Thomas Aquinas who brought them together but there are a lot of writers Aquinas was the most important one and the church formed everyone here formed Western civilization it was like the birthplace of Western civilization as we know it today you know conservatives get angry at leftists because it's left it always seems to us that left this go very easy on Islamic people when they do stuff wrong but very hard on Christians when they do stuff that they don't like so their country I mean I think it's 11 countries where homosexuality is still illegal in the Islamic world and sometimes you can get killed and killed for being gay yet hang thrown off a building for being gay and it seems too conservative lefties never say anything about this they never say a word but if mike pence god forbid you know mike pence says Christian yeah homosexuality I don't think that's right it's like Mike Pence is Satan I hate Mike Pence and the reason is the same reason that your friends can say things to you that your parents can't say I mean it's exactly the same reason wait you know if you're a girl when you get dressed and your roommate says to you you know that top it's a little it's a little revealing why don't you put on a sweater you put on a sweater he's okay but if your mom says to you are you going out in that you know it's like same thing with the church christianity is us whether we believe whether we have ever adopted it we've ever even thought about it it formed this society and christianity is essentially the thought of jesus st. paul aristotle and all the others put together so here's what aristotle with through all his teachers had to say and this is the most complicated philosophy in human history i'm gonna give it to you in two minutes so it's not gonna be exact but aristotle tried to figure out what was best for human beings i don't know if you have you ever seen Conan the Barbarian where they say what is best for human beings and all your Swartz maker says to crusher enemy doesn't listen to the lamentations of their women well Aristotle tried to think what is best for human beings and he had what I think was a brilliant thought he thought if you do something for another reason that can't be the best thing because you're doing it up the skin to get off the scale so money can't be the best thing because you have money to get stuff and stuff can't be the best thing because you usually have stuff for what it does for you but Aristotle found one thing that you have for itself that he thought was the point and purpose of human life and the best things for human beings and he called it eudaimonia which is a Greek word which is usually translated as happiness and you can hear it it really means good spirits you can hear that word a moan and they're like demon eudaimonia whose translated as happiness this was the thing that people wanted but you don't the ammonia is not happiness the way we think of happiness like that yellow smiley face because the jelly's yellow smiley face comes and goes like bad things happen to you all the time all of us and you're not happy when bad things happen a friend dies or something like that you're gonna be sad right but you did Moni is different than that and Jesus described had a description that I think is the right description a lot of Christians think that Jesus is the highest value I have a friend who's a pastor runs the daily wire and he says the purpose of Jesus is Jesus what does Jesus give me gives you Jesus but Jesus didn't say that Jesus said I've come so that you might have life in abundance I'm not preaching to you I'm just telling you where the thought comes from and life in abundance is really what eudaimonia is and I when I describe it I call it joy and what the way I describe it is if you're watching a movie and something sad happens you weep the heroine dies whatever you sob and sob and then you come out and say great movie that was a great movie when you can live life like that that's your demonium then you have you day mourning so how do you find it and this is the person who listens to what I say next is going to be the happiest person in about 20 years okay 20 years now it takes a long time to find you today morning because nobody nobody's gonna believe what I say but the thing is and this is an insight from Christianity and insight from st. Paul is you begin to find eudaimonia by realizing that you kinda suck right the the Bible says no one is righteous no not one you kind of suck and what does it mean you kind of suck well you kind of suck because you pretend you're brave but you're really scared out of your wits you pretend you're honest but really every one of you knows that some in some way your life is a lie and you're putting on a show for people and you pretend you care about people and sometimes you care about people but a lot of times yeah you know not so much and because you're not what you know in your heart you're supposed to be you're constantly terrified that people are going to find out what you really are and I offer you this experiment listen to your friends listen to how much of what they say is trying to convince you of what a good person they are incredible incredible number of words actions go into people just trying to show that they have virtue when they know they don't and it makes you unhappy you know this is this is another one of my issues with the left the left is always telling people that they're unhappy because of injustice this injustice here and this person's mistreating you there and that person's mistreating you there and that kind of thinking makes you weak because you're dependent on other people to change in order to find happiness once you realize that you're unhappy because you suck then it's in your control and you can start to find happiness how do you do it how do you pursue happiness well because the problem is is that you're not righteous you pursue virtue what the Greeks called r8a it means excellence okay and you can pursue virtue both in the moral sphere and you can pursue it in the professional sphere sphere you can pursue it all the time every day and when you turn yourself toward virtue in your life you continue to suck because you're a human being but you actually start to have eudaimonia it takes a while but it happens just to give you an example of how this works right let's say you're faithful to your spouse but you can be faithful to your spouse for all kinds of reasons you can be faithful cuz you're afraid of getting caught you couldn't be faithful because you're afraid you're not that good with women or whatever you know you can be faithful because your wife's father is a mobster and he says if you ever cheat on my daughter I'm gonna blow your kneecaps off right but after a while when you learn what fidelity is for and I can speak with authority on this because I have one of the great marriages in human history absolutely true and Mary for 40 years we have had one argument thirty years ago when you find what fidelity is for you find that it gives you integrity it means you are who you say you are and it means people start to react to you as if you are who you say you are they can count on you they can love you and know you're gonna be there and you start to have joy in your fidelity virtue said Aristotle and again I'm kind of condensing it all virtue is choosing the good because you love the good it's choosing to do the good because you love the good and you love the good because you know what the good is for this is why for instance I'm not a Catholic again I'm not preaching to you but this is why for instance the Catholics they talk about sex I know I'm sorry but I'm just not the this is when the Catholics talk about sex they say you should never have sex unless you're married you should be married to someone of the opposite sex and you shouldn't use birth control and by the way I know some Catholics who do this they say it's terrific they have like six kids but it's derivative but the thing is why do they say that oh they say it because they're evil you know pent up horrible people who hate gays no they say it because they're studying virtue and they believe that sex was made for something which is to have children to create children children should have a mother and father so you should be married and so you shouldn't use birth control because you should never do anything that forts the purpose now there are arguments against this really good arguments but in order to argue with somebody you need to understand why they're saying what they're saying and this is what they're doing they're trying to find a wrist Italian virtue in sex so that your sex life will give you joy will give you happiness in the Aristotelian sense now in order to have this virtue in order to choose the good because you love the good because you know what the good is for you need some tools you need to be live right and you need to have Liberty now you don't need to have Liberty if you're willing to die like Socrates and Jesus but that's not as much fun as it sounds you know in order to choose the good you need to be free to choose the good and this is why conservatives say they don't want the government forcing them to do something even if they know that thing is right they don't want it you divorce them to do something even if they know it's right if you woke up every morning I was standing over you with a gun and I told you what choices to make what decisions to make what attitudes to have what thoughts to have and I was always right I still would have taken away from you your happiness I would have taken away from you the most important thing you have which the ability to choose the good because you love the good so if you're following this argument and this is the argument of Western civilization I'm not making this up this is what it is if you're following this argument you understand that there's a problem with it right the problem is if you can choose the good you can choose the bat so our founding fathers Jefferson and the rest tried to construct a government a machine that would allow people to be free but would not force them to do even what they knew was right even what the founders knew was right so they created tensions between branches of government they created stopgaps to keep the government from having the power to do what human beings have done throughout history which is force people to do what they thought was right with the elite with the powerful but the wise and the good thought was right the founding fathers created this machine when you look at these machines on television I know our government is filled with jackasses but the machine was built so the jackasses couldn't ruin your life by forcing you to do even what was right and again the problem is if you can choose to do what's right you can choose to do what's wrong you can choose to say things that are disgusting you can choose to have attitudes they make you stink you can choose to do all those things and all of our founders all of our founders said that our Constitution was built for a religious and immoral people well why did they say that it wasn't because they wanted religion to scare people oh if you do this you'll go to hell it's because religions are essentially think tanks for figuring out virtue and they give you a context now they may be wrong there's all these different religions you have to kind of you know work out which one is right and obviously there's wiggle room but still that was why that was what the founders wanted people to be religious and swai they protected religion from the government the government could not tell the religious what to do it's all about your happiness and you know one of the things that drives me nuts about conservatives when they talk about the pursuit of happiness they don't talk about this they talk about building a business or you know having a career or living in the woods what whatever they think will make you happy but those things will only make you happy when things are going well yeah because when things go badly you will lose that eudaimonia but not if you're seeking virtue so I'm gonna try and keep this as short as possible because I Reaction want to hear from you and hear your reactions to what I'm saying but the thing about the right the idea that you have the god-given right to life but you need Liberty which you need to pursue what everyone wants which is happiness this is the single best political idea that anyone has ever had and no one will ever have a better one and and this is the problem with people coming along and saying oh yeah the world has this problem I've got a new system why is this the best idea and why will you never find a better I mean something you know sometimes when you reach the peak there's nowhere to go but down why do I say they'll never be a better idea than this because either you have the right to life or you don't and either we all have the right to life or no one does because the argument that I should have it but you shouldn't it's not a winner you know that's you don't have a hard time selling that argument to people that's the argument the Pharaohs sold of the service I do you have the right to Liberty or you don't and if you have the right to Liberty I have the right to Liberty that's why they'll never be a better idea than this and either you have the right to pursue happiness or you don't and you know people are different in a million ways they're different in a million ways but we're not different than this there's only one thing that philosophers were right about this there's only one thing that will make you happy and it is what I'm talking about even though it's a very complicated subject and it's still it's hard to find out what virtue is and what you think virtue is and start to train your heart to love it because the human body wants to do other things but you know when I hear people talk about identity identity politics and I hear them say well my identity is that I'm black my identity is I'm female my identity is that I'm gay I think like God love you you know I'm an old man nothing you do is gonna make me less or more happy okay I don't care how you live I don't care what you believe I don't care what you do with your lives I mean I can tell you if you ask me that some things are gonna make you miserable but the key thing is the key word there is you they're gonna make you miserable miserable so I don't care right but I'm just telling you that's not your identity you know obviously if you're a woman or a man that's part of your identity if you're black and white that's you know all of our races we all come from somewhere as part of your identity but your identity is that you are a child of this idea this idea is your inheritance nobody else inherited it from any place else but here everybody who has this idea got it from here you you lucky dogs were born here and it was given to you and I don't care if it's Barack Obama with Donald Trump if you let them take this away from you you will never get it back and you will never you the world will have a thousand years before anyone thinks of it again so that's my speech and I would love to hear what you have to say Thank You mr. Clavin I would like to open the floor to questions now I'm gonna correct myself we're gonna do questions on the right hand side of the room so your left hand side just so that the camera can see everybody please do keep your questions under a minute and if the speaker indicates you're allowed to respond but please keep your questions under a minute thank you don't tell me I silenced everybody don't worry you're saving mic gain uh can y'all hear me hi in the spirit of disagreeing just a little bit I'm curious what your thoughts are on American accept exceptionalism because I am on the left and I think a lot of what you say makes sense but I often get frustrated when I hear American is America is so exceptional we are number one because it seems to derail that whole starting point that you start with which you got to realize first that you kind of suck before you can actually in 20 years get better so what would your response be to someone who says America's number one there's no point in saying anything different well my my response is a it's absurd first at first American exceptionalism doesn't mean that and this is another thing makes me nuts because people say American exceptionalism like it means we're great it doesn't it means no one has had this idea before that we're supposed to be that free you know we're always hearing well in Europe they do this and Europe Europe had Kings for 2,000 years and did nothing but kill each other you know I mean it was great culture beautiful paintings but still you know we are exceptional because of these ideas that that makes us an exception we're exceptional because I lived overseas for seven years you can move to any other country on earth and you will never belong to that country here ten minutes after you caught the train you're an American and people treat you like an American I mean we really do we really do well look the individuals are individuals and individuals suck I mean that is the truth but but you know this is a country there's never been a place like this before we take a look going line and take a look at like Beijing take a look at you know Riyadh take a look at all the other cities in the world you don't see this mix of people that you see in New York and in San Francisco and the airports of this country it's amazing so it's exceptional in that way is it the greatest you know like I love it I love being here yeah you know I think that I it's only exceptional in that way okay the rest of it is us it's people we do terrible things to one another all of us it's not white men doing it the black men is all of us anybody who gets the chance anybody who has the power does it to people without the power you know and we're no exception and what sometimes makes us feel like an exception is is that we're so violating our our ideals when we do those evil things it's worse in a way it's like when the when there's a scandal in the Catholic Church and you know they rape a kid or something it's worse because they're violating their ideals so I guess that I hope that answers your question I mean it is not exceptionalism does not mean moral superiority it just doesn't it means that we have a unique idea ohso thank you for your speech again in the vein of the last question I wonder how do we distinguish between the ideas that you're talking about and some people most likely that are gonna be on the right I want to take that and turn that into sort of a a worldview that D values anyone from any other culture how do you do that and like to the point of even degrading their value as a human life ya know I mean obviously that is that is a problem on the right you know it really is and I think one of the things one of the things that is awful for all sides all sides that each idea becomes an umbrella for bad guys you know I mean if I were a racist I'd probably be on the right it would probably be easier to be on on the right if I were a communist and communists have killed more people in the last like hundred years than anybody ever before you know I would be on the left you know so they so these ideas can be an umbrella for for bad things and what I would say what I would say is simply that if what's unique about us is an idea if that's what's unique about us we are what is called a cradle country which also makes us unique also makes us exceptional then the entire concept that we are defined by our race is unamerican I mean it is because what we are saying is this is it this is what you buy into when you buy into America that's it that's the price of admission it's not that big it's not that big I mean it's everything of course it's like the mustard seed it's everything but it's not that big so on to me you know I'm also a Christian and to me racism is both unamerican and unchristian and that people do terrible things in the name of those philosophies it's just because people suck it always comes back it always comes back that's the one of the great insights of human life is does that answer the question thank you sir so as you said people suck right and it took thousands of years to get to the I to get to a government that exists to protect the pursuit of happiness and as we've seen in a lot of other cultures like Egypt right people buy into the idea that there's only one person that deserves this stuff right there's people underneath that have to support the government or in a kind of government right exactly so for those governments to exist what do you think the capability of places where they don't buy into this place like some places in the Muslim world or even some places around here where they don't where the people where this would most be benefiting don't agree with it what do you think the capability is since it took thousands of years to get here what do you think the capability or do you think the capability of those areas that don't have that baseline is to get to where we are today great question great question and a lot of people disagree with this George Will who's a old voice of conservatism says he doesn't believe it he doesn't believe that Muslims can discover democracy and freedom I think that that's absurd it's like saying because the electric light bulb was discovered here no one else can use it I mean it's it's the whole problem it's all about ideas it's not about anything else it's all about ideas once you've discovered freedom like discovering fire I can show you how to make fire you know once you discover a light bulb once you invent it anybody can use it there are questions that I have about Islam and I'm not an act you know I've read the Koran but but I don't know that much about it you know I know it's hard to know about a religion if you're not inside it really I have I have concerns about the Koran there too I have two concerns about three I should say three well one concern is that as I understand it there's no such thing as a secular government under Islam that is a serious problem because it doesn't leave people free to pursue happiness and discover virtue and they won't get to where they need to get to is that unlike the Bible which can be translated the Koran is the literal word of God so the actual words that are there are the words which makes it a little harder to liberalise so there's stuff in the Bible that was you know meant for its time it was meant for its moment and we can say well now we read this in a different way now we see it a different way you're we're meant to grow we're meant to learn you know God knows you know and so I worry about that and the third thing I worry about is what I see with my eyes that the Muslim majority countries are so unequal and they treat women in a way that I just don't think that I think is really difficult those are my concerns here's the hopeful side of this a young Muslim today even in one of the conservative Muslim countries has the attitudes according to surveys has the attitudes of a European in the 1960s okay that's pretty liberal that wasn't true thirty years ago the world is becoming a much much better place and we're playing a big role in that democracy and capitalism are two of the best things that ever happened hunger has been cut in half in the last 30 years poverty has been cut in half in the last 30 years around the world because of capitalism because I've been property rights democracy makes people happy it gives people a chance to become happy and so Muslims are liberating the people right and and religions must be interpreted because you know God means us to keep moving and keep thinking so I'm hopeful I'm really hopeful and you know I've known Islamic people who are great and some were not so great and I can say that about every kind of person I've ever met and so I'm hopeful but I have concerns that's honest answers thank you thank you hi so you said earlier that Jesus brought like more relevance to everything and I'm just wondering like do you think that like people are born evil I mean no no I don't I think people I you can look at I think people are broken I think people are broken the human system is is broken and I you know you can believe it's because Adam ate the apple I think that that's mythology that tells us something very truthful you know st. Paul said he wants to do the right thing but he keeps doing the wrong thing of whom is that not true it's true of all of us right we want to do the right thing but damn it we had a couple of drinks and you know it didn't work out people people are not evil but they are things that militate against their happiness and their decency their tribal right I mean racism is just a subset of tribalism we're all tribal we all believe it's very hard for us to step out of our you know our race our home country and say no we're all Americans it's hard for us to do that we can do it but it's hard it's hard for us to stay faithful in love to one another it's hard for us to be honest with one another those are the things that I think make our lives really tough it's hard for us to be brave when something is really on the line it's really easy to be brave when you're pretending to be brave but there are no consequences like Hollywood stars when they get up and they make some big speech because they know they're still gonna get higher than they're still gonna win awards they're still gonna make millions of ELLs that's easy but when something is really on the line like you might get thrown out of school you might lose your job you might lose your life it's hard to be brave so I don't think we're evil I think we have the comparable capacity to do what's wrong and I there's a difference between those two things because I've met you know I was a newspaperman I've met guys who would shoot your shoot you in the head just for laughs you know they're evil I don't think most people will like that I I'd like to clarify about you pneumonia and what whether or not you believe everyone has the the ability to achieve that in the United States that's almost a medical question in theory yes in theory I believe everybody has the ability to achieve that now I think there are people who are naturally happier than other people and are naturally gonna feel they're people who feel more I mean this this is scientists have said this I assume it's true you've met people who are door you know they're kind of down in the dumps and people who are just up and happy all the time so I believe there are different capacities for feeling things but yes I believe whatever your best life is you can have that's what I believe and as a follow-up to that do you believe that the laws in America protect people equally that those laws allow people to achieve that full happiness because I believe that people are not equally protected under the law in the United States really because like officers who aren't who aren't prosecuted for the for the murder of young black men or the ability to murder transgender people because it made someone else uncomfortable and those people are not prosecuted how can someone feel safe if these laws aren't protecting them okay that's that's a big question and let me see if I can take it one step at a time first a lot we live in a country 300 million people is huge it's a continent right bad stuff happens bad stuff happens 300 million people are you gonna get some bad stuff there's there's something called familiarity bias I can't remember the exact words but the things that are in front of you are the things that you think are happening all the time very few a very few young black men get shot by the police very few I mean in in a country of 300 million people one is too many if he's innocent obviously but still and second there have been three independent studies that show that black that cops to not use violence more more readily against black people so you see this on TV and it's terrible but you think it's happening more than it is the fact the fact is that life in America is not it's not quite fair yet but it's gotten so much fair it's fairer than it was but it's getting really really close things were getting really much better there is not I mean I don't know what you were referring to is it that you can kill the transgender person what state has that law it's not necessarily that allows it it's the the people who overlook those kinds of things transgender people go missing all the time 2,000 people in the last year who are transgender were murdered and this is a crisis that goes on address and and you you know this to be the case that they were murdered and there was not prosecuted because of because they were transgender because they're not respected by the people in the country in America they aren't they don't have the ability to have a good life in the United States because the law is not adequately protecting them yeah because the laws that we have still allow these kinds of crimes to occur against minorities see I have to challenge you on this it is possible that unjust people but under their you know 300 million there's gonna be a lot of unjust people it's possible that unjust people allow these crimes to occur but there's no law that allows these crimes to occur and the important thing about that is when I was a kid there were laws that allow things like this to occur you know I mean and that that really is a difference so yes there are unjust people in the world but the fact is you know I got to tell you something like you guys are gonna live longer than any generation has ever lived before you're probably going to colonize the Moon and Mars the last thing you have to worry about in this country seriously is racism I know I know they sell it to you like a big-time but and I know other people are racist and there's bad stuff that happens but just numerically you know like you said it's it's not it's not as big as it is in our imaginations and take a look at the numbers take a look at what is actually happening versus the wall-to-wall coverage that everything that supports that agenda gets so look you know these these things are atrocities you're talking about but there is nothing in America that permits these atrocities and countries have existed and exists in this very day where they do permit them this isn't one of them I mean there's no law anywhere it was says oh go ahead you'll kill the transit go ahead you know I mean I let me tell you one quick anecdote right I was on a book tour I was in San Francisco I was in a cab Gay Pride Day right traffic stopped okay just parade all over the place the driver got annoyed right and he kind of felt me out that he feel whatever I wasn't he realized I was a conservative and so he felt free to say to me you know he said you know it's really ridiculous that these people define themselves by their sexuality and I said yes it that is ridiculous but I'm old enough to remember when you could be a cop could go into a gay bar and you would try and pick him up and the cop could arrest you and the driver said arrest you for what he had no concept of where this came from you know in other words he was so far improvement progress erases it's footsteps okay when you when you progress you still think things are bad they're not that bad they really aren't and things you know I just do not think that going by the numbers there a black man walking down the street driving a car is in serious danger anymore that I'm a serious danger of being killed by an Islamist almost never happens it's like be hit by lightning the same thing for this so I guess I guess what I'm saying to you is yes are there in justices yes should you pursue them yes but is this an unjust country right now really really I don't think your times sake this will have to be your final call okay I don't think that you nor I really have the ability to comment on racism because we don't have to deal with it as something in our daily lives so you may never get pulled over because of the color of your skin but I know a lot of people who could and their experience is what I'm referencing that they don't necessarily that cop doesn't necessarily need a reason or he won't be necessarily persecuted like of a man or woman who is of color can be persecuted in this country in a certain way under the law by cops by other people because I'm sorry I've completely lost my thoughts I'm sorry the only thing I would challenge you on there is so often so many political arguments people start telling you you can't comment on this and I think you can comment on anything and I I'm not comparing my experiences which are my experiences with other people's but experiences can be wrong right your inner experience of something can be incorrect yeah that's that's in fact I would say the key trick of human life is aligning your inner experiences with reality so I understand if if I watch TV I think I would feel unsafe but uh but numerically you're not that's that's my point I mean you are in safe in certain cities Chicago Baltimore st. Louis you know you're unsafe but here you're not I answer I just want to ask you two quick questions um first is I run into you that a professor here hws who openly praises communism is at this moment holding a counter event called free speech when communism all things considered punishes those who are speaking out against the status quo and then my second question is as I've been seeing all throughout campus people have written the word Nazi on the Flyers showing your face so is this ironic and T is this ironic to you concern you're raises an Orthodox Jew I wasn't raised as an Orthodox Jew that's pushing it but I you know it is it is funny it is funny when people like me I'm gonna answer your second question first because I want to go back to the first one it is funny when people like me are accused of things like being called fascist or or Nazi or something like that when you were sitting here talking about more freedom more Liberty more you do what you want I mean I guess I just feel like nobody ever went to the dictionary under F and looked up what fascism means or what it looks like because we have it so good in this country and we do have it you know relatively speaking we have it really good little things get us crazy you know and we start to hurl these epithets at one another and it really becomes absurd the things the things we say about one another you know just are just silly because they make us feel big and heroic and we're in some kind of big fight and we're not you know it's it's like it's just a lot easier to be here than it is to be a lot of other places so yeah you know I mean I always I always laugh when I hear people talk about microaggressions because first of all I feel I feel that when somebody teaches you to react to microaggressions that teaching you to be weak you know because I deal with this stuff all the time what would it be like if I got traumatized every time somebody called me a Nazi I mean I never get out of bed you know and I think that it's just part of it's part of part of being free is being tough part of being free is being tough you know if you're gonna be free you gotta have a thick hide you got to be able to take the heat because free people say stupid stuff that one of them now tell me this subtitle of that communist guy again arm it was actually called free speech and open open forum so screeching open the problem with communism is very simple okay I mean communism sounds so good see that that's the funny thing you can walk if I you can walk down the street with a t-shirt with Che Guevara mass murdering scum on your t-shirt and nobody will say a word to you know try walking down the street with like Hitler and but but communism wiped out more people then Hitler did you know and murder people in Champa telling China and Russia did why because people if they're free you can't both be free and equal I can't be LeBron James the only way that I can play LeBron James on a basketball court is if you take stuff away from him because there's not a damn thing in this world you can do to bring me up to his level right so once you want people to be equal you've got to use force you've got a force LeBron not to put the ball in the basket and once you start to do that of course you know you're oppressing them that's the first thing the second thing of course is we're people we need a reason to get up in the morning a reason to do things the capitalist system the reason it works so great is because it gives you incentive to beat me out in a you know free open but competitive way and it doesn't mean there can't be limits on capitalism but socialism I mean we just saw and Venezuela you know Sean Penn you know punching you go Chavez you know what a great guy he's bringing socialism to Venezuela now they're eating cats in the street I mean this is a country where breakfast grows on the trees and they're eating cats I mean not even dogs you know doc the Hogs might be good be cats you know so so I don't know what the guy is talking about I think if he had lived any history if you had any truth at all he would realize that this is ridiculous I was just telling Katrina that I was sorry about Bernie Sanders that he honeymooned in the Soviet Union a slave state a state that enslaved most of Eastern Europe to me you know I you want to talk about a culture I don't respect that's a culture I don't misplay thank you hi I'm a big fan of you are some big fan of The Daily wire I like a lot of what you guys do my question has to do with America being a melting pot and you hear people say typically on the Left that America is not a melting pot it's a salad bowl and to me I've never really understand that analogy because a salad bowl you eat it all together anyways and it still tastes good so I think there needs to be a better analogy but the concept is basically that you know the the tomatoes stay over here the letter stays over here no one actually like blends and comes together like a melting pot wood which to me I think that what makes America so unique is that you come together and become American but there seems to be a lot of pushback on that and and just saying that that we're not appreciating people's cultures or people's heritage so to what extent should becoming American also validate another person's culture without making that culture the law in America no I agree with you you know it's really interesting I saw this movie did anybody get out good I really liked that film you know and and I was thinking back to an older movie called The Godfather you know which The Godfather the Sicilians come in and they have run the mob but they want to get into American culture and at the end of the movie the son says to the father the father says to the son you know I wanted you to be a senator I didn't want you to be a mobster I wanted you to become an American and he says well we'll get there we'll get there eventually that was the goal in get out the idea is you hang out with white people if you're a black person you hang out with white people they steal your your essence you know and and I just thought that was interesting I thought it made a good movie but I thought philosophically I disagree with it I think that the melting pot was right eeep lura bassoon um that make one out of many I think that that is the right idea because we're talking what we are talking about what when we talk about America we're not talking about a plot of ground we're talking about an idea and he subscribed to that idea that creed and and you're an American and and look at America look at what happened to America when it was a melting pot when we thought of it as a melting pot you know would anybody say that Irish culture hasn't transformed America or Italian culture hasn't contributed to America or Jewish culture all the people who came in and are coming in now that they won't transform America by melting in by can you know including it it doesn't work like they like get out I mean get out it's good because it's a horror movie so they it's your worst nightmare but it doesn't work like that you know if you join in if you assimilate you you get something and the culture gets something from you and I think that's the only system that works I don't think you can do it any other way people have been doing the salad bowl thing for the rest of history for all the rest of history and they have been killing each other over their cultures all that time you know we had one one civil war here and it was done and we had a civil war because we weren't living by our deals and so we returned apart between practice and idea you know that's that's what happened in this award but since then Europe you know had all these different states each person had this culture it was a salad bowl they did nothing but kill each other you know where America has been internally very peaceful thank you so I had a quick point um so you argued a bit against I'm sort of the use of identity politics within like a current political climate um and I sort of all agree in the sense that like ICS is all being the same I think I've read recently that like you can find more genetic variation within 60 different South African chimpanzees than the entire human race right so we're all the same like I get that and so you know I'll be with you to that extent but statistics indicate for example and I apologize for speaking on a group that I'm not a part of but for example right like that african-american community has not seen the same financial income for example as the white community and we also both know I'm assume you've seen the same statistics saying that you need to have an income of roughly seventy thousand dollars per year to achieve like a certain sort of baseline plateau happiness or whatever so I just don't understand how you can argue against gender politics but I politics given the fact that there are very specific groups of people based on their race based on their religion based on the color of their skin that are repressed within a country okay first I don't believe they are repressed in our current country right there what they're experiencing is the effect of bad deeds in history I mean this country you know I don't know if this country was any worse anymore racist I mean I lived overseas I was shocked I mean this this country is the least racist country now that I've ever been in but I remember I remember what that was like and and there's no question that that has an effect the theory behind what you're saying okay is that that you can fix the past and that you fix the past by counterbalancing the past so in other words you say well you know white people were miserable - black people actually they were you know we we all agree right that that's part of it's part of the sad history of this country every country has sad history that's part of ours so now you're going to bend the line back by essentially what taking things from people who never did anything to anybody white people today and giving it to people who did not suffer those things even though they're suffering the historical effect and what what I believe in what I know to be true is that every injustice goes on one side of the scale and it doesn't matter if you mean it to be a good injustice to fix things or it's a bad injustice to begin things every injustice goes on the wrong on that side of the scale the only way to get rid of this one of the judges I think was Antonin Scalia said the only way to get rid of racial prejudice is to stop but I don't think you can you're pretty much just arguing right by having this colorblind society we're just gonna say like Oh things will even out naturally it's sort of blind to the fact that like it's harder to be successful if you grow up poor you're just pretty much saying like you you acknowledge the fact that we have this probably you're saying like oh just let it balance out even though it won't it's it's hard it is really harder to grow up successful if you're poor it's incredibly hard if you have no father which is really one of the big problems we have in this society like his father fatherless port there's a thing called the sequence the sequence is this go to high school don't get married until you're 21 I think don't have children until you're married and you won't be poor the odds of your being poor if you do those things and and look look every every person every group who came to this country went through this are the other blacks unique yes they are they have a unique story a unique history but it's his pick that cloud has passed away there is not one thing there's not one thing let me put it to you this way this is I guess my major point there's not one thing that anybody in this room will ever not be able to do because of racism there's not one thing not one thing that we're with there will be stopped by racism so you acknowledge the fact right that certain groups are oppressed right financially no no I don't know that people were oppressed and that it can have an effect in the present sorry you arguing at the African American community right now does not see a lesser financial income in the like you know I wouldn't say that I said that there is an effect no no I did I didn't say that I didn't say that I said that there is an effect of the historical injustice and right which is which was sort of what you were saying by saying like oh you should just follow this line of like get a high school education don't get married but then that still doesn't adjust the statistics that it's order to get out of existence of poverty unless there is some sort of systemic change you haven't proposed any sort of fix to this you're just acknowledging the fact that well but accept that every other group has has done it when the time came and there and the racism passed every other group has done and and you know you're not actually you're not actually being when you when you say this to people you're not actually helping them are you I mean you know you know the rise the rise of black people into the middle class okay it was faster before 1970 than it is now but the political change yes but the political change was all on your side it was all I mean the Great Society the Great Society stopped black progress no I didn't say that but look it's a it's a difficult conversation I'm not so we've gone back and forth a lot at least from what I've listened to so far between theory and then you say numbers right let's look at the numbers let's get the theory so one thing back to the melting pot thing that was pretty cool multi possible one thing I like to look at it as like you know you have your glass of milk you pour your chocolate syrup in it and you know everything's together it's what it's supposed to be right that's a diversity we need that's a diversity we're looking for is it consistent is it good no no one wants to syrup sitting at the bottom of the at the cup you have to mix it through and when it's consistent through and through that's when you have your chocolate milk that's when it's actually good right so James Baldwin once said we have a tendency particularly here in America to do away with all these issues without liberating ourselves from them right so you're saying it's a result of past injustice 'as the things that are happening now that's us saying okay we're gonna abolish all of these things that are bad just to say we abolish them without actually liberating ourselves with them which is why we have these issues and that's a theory right so that's a theory let's look at the numbers now 90% of African American children will stay in the same class or be in a class below their parents that is the statistic I can send you the information if you like it right and on the reverse side 90% of their white counterparts will be at that same one before the ones that are in the upper middle class or will be increasing right so if we're going to do away with all of these and justices and without liberating ourselves from them how in fact is it actually equal well how in fact is actually but I'm curious though how you can have a statistic about the future that's that's the research done over the past 30 years and that's and that's continuing the same trend but how can you say that 90% of people now are going to be in the same class in the future because again we have a thing of abolishing all of these past and justices like you said yeah without liberating ourselves from them so this isn't so if this is an issue that you're saying we're suffering from past and justices that's the only reason why things are not as good as it could be although we've made so much progress how much progress have we actually made okay if we're doing this for a you know news and press and to say oh we're liberal we're inclusive we're doing all of these things when the fact of the matter is you know our paths are going to be drastically different simply because we were born from different parents well you know again I question whether you can predict the future from this moment you know like you know you know how they say if trends continue trends never continue so so that's always always not true but secondly look there is there is historic dysfunction among the poor okay and they always blame to the race that is poor the British used to blame the Irish you know and they and then the you know the whites blame the blacks in America among the poor there is consistent dysfunction and the dysfunction has to do with family with family makeup did you read the book Hillbilly elegy I mean that's that's that's the hillbilly that's the hillbilly world some of that world is the world that voted for Donald Trump they have the exact same I mean the mirror image dysfunction that you get in poor black neighborhoods that dysfunction can be addressed I mean that dysfunction can be addressed but it has to be addressed in ways that sometimes are politically unacceptable so when you say to people you know you need dads you need to have a dad in your community that's true in West Virginia and it's true in Baltimore and it was true in Ireland and it's true you know it's true in all these places I mean you know if you read Shelby Steele yeah I mean Shelby Steele I would say my I think he's the best living black writer of nonfiction anyway I do I think he's a I'm a writer so I just love him so all right well I love his prose no so but but he talks about the fact that you know fathers aren't always good fathers but the fathers that were in his community made the community so people like him could become what he is and that is missing you know the black fatherless rate is 72 percent that is worse that is worse than when white men were selling the river to break their families apart that's a problem you look at but I mean I guess I guess my point is this my point is this yes I will I will let you speak in just a second but just to make my point it's it's just that the dysfunction is connected to poverty I do not believe it's connected race thank you appreciate we're gonna take two more questions we have time for two more questions hi there so I was actually at the free speech thing for the first 20 minutes that was referenced earlier and within five minutes that had escalated from free speech to race issues and one of the things that was brought up was that today people of color are living in kind of you know the shadow of the oppression that they experienced a long ago and they're still experiencing its effects even if the actual pressure like the oppressive laws aren't in place and so I was kind of wondering like I think that's true I think despite the fact I can't point to a law that says you know black people are at this disadvantage or should be at this disadvantage I think that racism carries on on an individual level because as you said people suck and I think that because of the situation that happened you know pre before 1860s a lot of black people started or a lot of black families started at a lower level and so I was just wondering I mean I think that's all objectively true do you agree with that and if so how do we rectify that because if the United States is about equal opportunity that's not equal opportunity right no I do agree with it this is what I'm telling you I do agree with it what I think that I'm telling you is his history is tragic in this regard it's tragic in twice right one it's tragic because you really can't fix the past you can't and you can't all you can do is stop what you were doing and let the generations take care of it that's all you can do it never no one's ever done anything else okay and the other thing that's tragic about it is I'm saying this who doesn't have to suffer okay and that's tragic cuz it takes the authority out of my voice even though what I'm saying is true okay so yes this is a tragic fact you know all kinds of things should be done for the poor in this country they will I think they will be done like I said poverty has been cut in the world by in half in 30 years with just an amazing stat so I think I think it's gonna happen but I think it's gonna be painful and what I really do believe what I really do believe is when we're talking I believe this in every subject when we're talking about race we're always talking about the wrong thing whether it's Jews whether it's Irish words it's all about ideas and policies and I think that everything that you do in America should be done for everybody so that's why I say the problem is with how do we how do we address poverty which is always a good question not how do we address black poverty even though they are suffering from specific follow-up to that is I do actually think that this is more of a specifically black problem the United States because they were add more even more of a disadvantage than you know the Chinese the Irish the Italians that came into our country like the Irish yeah there because the Irish the Chinese they were they were come here and they were basically servants in like indentured servants they had jobs and they were making money but they had no rights and weren't able to do anything with that and so to come off of that and my my this is opinion now my opinion is that that's easier to in a sense like grow off of than black people who were brought here as slaves who were you know white people were basically told for generations that these people are less than you treat them such and I think that's a much harder thing to recover from and so do you think that you should check the history of the Irish in this country because even blacks were writing at the time well at least we're not the Irish you know I mean the Irish came to here with nothing they were despised the signs really did say no Irish need apply basically you know so look this is this is stuff that has happened and and you can you can argue that you know color gave them a leg up but but I really do think it is it's in the end it's culture and ideas you know it's it's interesting in in Russia where the Jews were so mistreated the Jews were a criminal class and nobody would look at Americans say the Jews are a criminal class I mean that's just not something you'd say about American Jews you know and and so the way people are treated in the moment is what makes them who they are the minute you stop treating them like that they stop being like that and I think that that's the answer that's the only you know the problem is it's the only answer if I could fix it some other way I would you know and that's what I notice is when you try to fix it some other way you only extend the injustice into the next generation good evening drew so earlier you touched on these the chances of our American ideas the ideas of the Greeks in Christ our founding fathers and the chances of those ideas spreading around the world to other cultures do we as Americans go first of all what should we as Americans do to aid that spread along and do we have a responsibility to do anything like that or do we have a responsibility not to do anything like that keeping in mind you know past failures you know I think our failures again are overrated you know there's more democracies in the world right now I believe than there's ever been but they're an awful lot remember when when the Americas started they were not you know we were it you know I mean there was a Britain which had a constitutional monarchy but this was it and now even even people who are not republics I'd have to pretend they are like remember the Soviet Union was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics you know you could only elect one guy but that was it you know that was they were the Republic East Germany was called the democratic state of East Germany or something like that they had to pretend because now we know it works now we know it's a good thing so hell yes we should sell it you know but I mean you know you don't like I believe in the imperialism of ideas not the imperialism of guns you know you don't sell it by going into your country and saying you know now you're gonna be Democrat hi we're here now you're gonna be democratic you know Rome is over but sure you sell it you sell it by showing them how great it is that's that's one of the reasons I hate the fact that every movie is anti-american you know I mean in in other in the old movies we used to examine our problems but America was a good thing overall I think we should sell the hell out of democracy and capitals because it works it works it makes people happier it makes them richer which also makes them happier you know so yeah I do think that's our responsibility how can it not be this concludes our program for this evening if you could join me in thanking mr. Clavin and and thank you for your civil conversation I love hearing the other sides of these things because otherwise I'm just sitting there talking to myself so thank you everyone for coming
