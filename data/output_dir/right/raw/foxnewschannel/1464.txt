00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:05,656
IT'S AN INTERESTING COUNTRY TO

4
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:06,456
DEAL WITH.

5
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:08,325

THE EARLY SENT AN ADVANCE TEAM

14
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:22,539
TO SINGAPORE AND TURNED OUT THE

15
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,076
NORTH KOREAN COUNTERPARTS WERE

16
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:27,277
REFUSING TO TAKE THEIR CALLS SO

17
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,845
THIS IS NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP

18
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:33,350
FLYING OFF THE HANDLE THIS IS

19
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,217
RESPONDING TO NOT HAVING

00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:37,988
NEGOTIATIONS AND THIS IS CLASSIC

21
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:38,388
NEGOTIATION.

22
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:41,024
YOU PUNISH BAD BEHAVIOR AND IF

00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:41,892
THEY DON'T RETURN CALLS YOU HAVE

24
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:43,560

25
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,494
>> Martha: WHAT POTENTIALLY

26
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:46,296
WOULD THEY AGREE TO?

27
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,298
YOU HAVE THE LIBYA MODEL WHICH

28
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,435
IS A COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION

29
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:53,804
WHICH GETS TO THEM AND THEN THE

30
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:54,971
IRAN DEAL MODEL.

31
00:00:54,971 --> 00:01:04,181
YOU HAVE AN OVER TIME AGREEMENT.

32
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:06,116

00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:16,993
MOE

00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,600
AND THEY'RE ACUTELY AWARE OF

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,202
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THESE

00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:25,969
DICTATORSHIPS COLLAPSE.

38
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:27,137
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IRAN AND

39
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:28,839
LIBYA THE PARTNER COUNTRY IS

40
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:29,506
CHINA.

41
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,375
THERE'S NO CHINA VIS A VIS IRAN

42
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,578
BUT THERE IS WITH NORTH KOREA

43
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:36,880
AND WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED WITH

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,348
WHAT CHINA WANTS AND WILL ALLOW.

45
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,450

PRESIDENT XI SOMETHING HAPPENED.

49
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,361
>> CHINA HAS A STRONG PART TO

50
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,696
PLAY AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

51
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,664
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE SO

52
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:57,834
MUCH IS ALLOWING KIM JONG-UN TO

53
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,237
SAFE FACE IF ONLY TO ALLOW HIM

54
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:02,239

KOREA?

58
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:14,217
>> BUT THEY DON'T WANT REFUGEES

59
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,585
CROSSING THE RIVER THAT DON'T

60
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:16,853
KNOW HOW TO USE COMPUTERS.

61
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:17,754
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT THE

62
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:20,290
MOUNTAIN THAT COLLAPSED MONTHS

63
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:20,991
AGO.

64
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:24,494
WAS WHAT THEY BLEW UP TODAY EVEN

65
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:24,995
USABLE?

66
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:26,897
>> AND REPORTS ARE RADIATION'S

67
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:31,101
COMING OUT AND THEY DO NOT LET A

68
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:32,803
GOOD CRISIS GO TO WASTE.

69
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:35,205
SOMETHING'S GOING TO BE

70
00:02:35,205 --> 00:00:00,000
DESTROYED, THEY MIGHT AS WELL
