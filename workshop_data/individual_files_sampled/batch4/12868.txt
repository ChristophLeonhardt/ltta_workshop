Donald Glover is getting sued for plagiarism I love this you remember this song it came out a little while ago this is America dupa dupa do and it was like America's really bad and we just all we do is kill people and it's racist and it you know it turns black people into just minstrel show puppets and it's just America is really bad and when when when it turns out he stole the song he's getting accused of plagiarism right now so he's being accused of plagiarism by people who listen to another song by Jace Hartley I you're not familiar with Jace Hartley neither am i but he did a song called American Pharoah and just judge for yourself what it the first one is childish gambino this is America the second one is Jace Hartley American Pharoah see if you can tell the difference it's the same song it's definitely the same song and Donald Glover who also goes by Childish Gambino he's like the worst thief ever because he kept part of the name of the original in the name of his song so without attribution without acknowledging that it was obviously influenced by in a good way or just a ripoff of American Pharoah American Pharoah by Jace Hartley this is America by Donald Glover childish gambino there's a great irony here right the this is America's song is all about how America is just a place of theft it's a place of oppression stolen labor stolen property it's all guns right taking taking things at the foot of a at the barrel of a gun and then what does he do he steals the song I don't maybe I maybe I'm not giving him enough credit maybe this is a real piece of meta or you know is like really art about art and he's really making this commentary I don't think so I think he just stole it and now Jace Hartley's been very nice about this he said Harley said that this is you know he's proud that it influenced the song and he would have liked a little shout out but that's okay whatever and it is true it's really hard to prove these cases I don't know that Donald Glover is actually gonna have to pay anything out and it's really hard not to be influenced by other music especially when the music is as bad as this the fact that this music is so bad is actually part of the reason why it's hard not to steal so you know other musicians this happens all the time musicians hear a ton of music then they write something they don't even realize they're rewriting something else George Harrison did this on the song My Sweet Lord he basically he took something he was obviously influenced by the song he's so fine by the chiffons he seems to have been influenced by it and by the way those two songs are way more different than american pharoah and this is america but why is that because those two songs have music in them those two songs you know my sweet lord has guitars and piano and it's got its got melody harmony and rhythm right it's got it's actually music and so does a he's so fine by the chiffons so they sound kind of similar but you know they were little differences all this has his rhythm and talking it doesn't even have a melt it's just talking right this is America dupa dupa bad I'm a monocle know so what I love ba ba ba it doesn't there's no music to it so when you strip you know if childish gambino had stolen the beat the rhythm of it but he had changed the melody in the harmony then you'd say okay whatever that's fine he's been influenced but he's building on something but he can't he can't even do that if he takes the beat he's got the whole song because there's real very minimal music and the rest of the song
