day 480 of the Trump administration and we have some of the most revealing reporting yet on special counsel Robert Muller's investigation what it's like behind the in the scenes on the inside and especially the toll it's taking on the president as this inquiry moves into its second year this comes to us from the team at the Washington Post one of the writers Ashley Parker standing by to join us she and her colleagues conducted interviews and this is important with 22 White House and Justice Department officials witnesses Trump confidants attorneys connected to the investigation the post reporters write quote the Muller operation like the former Marine Corps platoon commander who leads it is secretive and methodical ten blocks west in the White House President Trump combats the probe with bluster disarray and defiance as he scrambles for survival on the president's mood they report this quote the president vents two associates about the FBI raids on his personal attorney Michael Cohen as often as 20 times a day in the estimation of one confidante and they frequently listened in silence knowing little they say will sue them Trump gripes that he needs better TV lawyers to defend him on cable news and is impatient to halt the witch-hunt that he says undermines his legitimacy as president and he plots his battle plans with former New York Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani his new legal counsel Jerry quote were on the same wavelength Giuliani said we've gone from defense to offense and this is what the reporters write about the grand jury proceedings quote Muller the 73 year old former FBI director with a hangdog visit and rigid bearing looms over the investigation but is an intermittent presence in the windowless room in the e Barrett Prettyman federal courthouse grand jury witnesses arrive one by one at the windowless room in the courthouse on Constitution Avenue in downtown Washington they are struck first by how commonplace the setting feels more classroom than courtroom two witnesses said one of Special Counsel Robert Muller's prosecutor stands at a lectern the jurors diverse by age and ethnicity are attentive and take notes the questioning is polite yet aggressive surprising witnesses with its precision and often accompanied by evidence including text messages and emails displayed on a large old-fashioned overhead projector great detail there and with that let's bring in our leadoff panel for a Monday night the aforementioned Ashley Parker Pulitzer Prize winner at the Washington Post as White House reporter Jonathan Lemire White House reporter for The Associated Press and Mimi Roca former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York now a distinguished fellow in criminal justice at the Pace University School of Law welcome to you all again Ashley fantastic detail by you and the members of your team what struck you most and allow me to call it about the Trump method and the Muller method what struck us most was just how different they were both sort of in temperament and goal you have Muller who is methodical and disciplined and leak-free and you have the president who is loud and blustery and defiant and as we started doing these interviews and reporting we also realized that they're making two very different cases Muller's team is building again methodically a legal case in the president while he has a team of lawyers and he may need a legal defense is building a political case and a PR case that he's taking to the public and it is sort of an open question of which one of these will win out and rule the day and which one will be more important or if in some ways a good PR case in the court of public opinion can help combat what is going to be a very airtight legal case whatever he finds by robert muller i'm gonna ask you again to react to your own work in part here's another quote from this piece you contributed to many Trump aids and associates say they are confident the president will be exonerated but they privately express worries that the probe may yet ensnare more figures in Trump's orbit including family members there is particular word about Trump's eldest son Donald Trump jr. and Jared Kushner his son-in-law and a senior advisor and Ashley mr. Kushner signaled just how serious it might be by his choice of lawyers in Washington Abbey law among the very best for especially for officials who find themselves in trouble but the the first part was so important those close to the president believing at this late date in his eventual exoneration they absolutely believe that nearly everyone we talked to believes especially when it comes to collusion they believe that the president says he's done nothing wrong they believe him when he says that and they also sort of say look Bob Muller is so thorough that if what there was a-there there it would have turned up by now there's a little more question on the obstruction of justice bucket and just because no one sort of quite knows what the bar is and what they may not know but they sort of describe saying we believe the president will be exonerated but they are sort of psychologically stealing themselves for a long slog because they don't know if and when it will happen and they also recognize in the process and again I should be clear this is their speculation but that this will they talk about this going to the top and when they say the top they don't necessarily mean the president they mean the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and his oldest son Don Jr and one thing we mentioned in there it's a tiny detail and it took quite obvious detail but one of the people who was called was Jared Kushner's 29 year old personal assistant on the one hand that makes perfect sense it's not particularly alarming on its own but this is the person who was helping with Jared schedule planning his travel knows who he is you know talking to which foreign governments he's had contact with so there is a sense that Muller is looking into the president's family as well that's what's so unnerving for all these witnesses you don't know fully what they know when you sit down for questioning or what's been said in the room prior to your arrival Jonathan Lemire you've been in touch shall we say with the former mayor of New York quite a bit of late how does Rudy Giuliani's current world view of this investigation and square with what we know of reality well it is different it actually makes a great point sort of how this the president and his team were sort of fighting us on two different fronts yes there is a legal defense but right now Rudy Giuliani's focus seems to be the more outward facing the public relations case the one that he's making on Fox News and other cable networks many hours of the day now the president was frustrated for a long time before he hired Giuliani he heard that you know he couldn't he wanted an attack dog to be on television he was tired of the criticism that he couldn't find a big-name lawyer to come on the team he hired Rudy Giuliani and in fact he told one confidant that we quoted in one of our stories that look look at this I finally have him I have America's bleep and Mayor now like he's on board like he was very far off about that and he likes the rule he's out there taking the fight to the press making the case he does not however like everything that Giuliani has done he's made some notable missteps we're talking about the store mcdaniels payments or the michael cohen situation or most recently the merger with AT&T and Time Warner but Giuliani is emblematic of a more aggressive tact this White House is trying to take with Muller probe we're seeing more and more signals from the White House itself like my vice president Mike Pence last week and Trump allies suggesting this needs to wrap up this has gone on too long that it's becoming a distraction and impeding the president from doing the nation's business and while they're making that case they're also engaging in some stall tactics in terms of whether the Trump interview is going to happen remember Giuliani originally said he wanted to make a decision on whether the president would sit down for that interview by the one-year anniversary of mulish appointment which is just in a few days instead he told me on Friday that they're pushing that back they're not going to have any sort of interview before the North Korea summit which is June 12th and most likely wouldn't even make a decision as to whether there would be an interview until after that date he also acknowledged they've done next to no preparations for what would be arguably the most important day of president Trump's term in office that's for sure Mimi Roca counselor we were awfully eager to have you on the air tonight mostly because of my favorite detail in this Washington Post piece and that is the overhead Scheckter because it speaks to the kind of civics lesson that is buried in this piece of journalism about how modest in a Federal Building in Washington our grand jury process is really by design it's the antithesis of Trump Tower just as Muller is the antithesis of Donald Trump so shed some light on on what this piece gets right about the interior spaces of the federal buildings you occupied for a living for so many years well it really did strike me when I read it and I'm sure every prosecutor or FBI agent who read it said yeah that's kind of what it's like you know the Southern District of New York for example you cannot get a more decrepit building quite honestly but it's a badge of honor and here's why because the people who work in those buildings they don't care what the building looks like they don't care that it's dug there's an inch of dust and it's falling apart what they care about is the work they're doing because they're so dedicated to it and it's sort of this feeling of I love this job I am dedicated to this job even though I'm working in a place that looks like this and that's kind of the the spirit and I'm sure that's what's going on with Muller and and his team they're they're not paying attention to the room and the other thing that struck me is about the grand jury you know the the detail about them taking notes and listening attentively this is what goes on in grand juries and in courtrooms all over the country our fellow citizens undreds of times a day I mean these are ordinary American citizens and when you hear Trump and his team talk about you know the witch-hunt by the prosecutors who are out to get him who all donated to Hillary well guess what the the people who are really you know ultimately the ones who if there were an indictment of anyone who would vote on that indictment and who get to ask questions and help direct the investigation sure it's the prosecutors but grand jurors can ask for evidence they can ask questions of the prosecutors asked them those are ordinary American citizens so it's it's really shows sort of the lie of them calling this a witch-hunt hey
