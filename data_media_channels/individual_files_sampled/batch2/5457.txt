President Trump is reportedly pushing for an interview with special counsel robert muller against the advice of his legal team The New York Times reports the president wants to sit down with Muller's investigators believing that he can convince them that the probe is a witch-hunt and clear himself of wrongdoing president Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani tells NBC News Muller's team is offering to narrow the range of topics for both oral and some written questions to two main topic areas collusion and obstruction all right let's not forget the president's tweet on Tuesday collusion is not a crime but that doesn't matter because there was no collusion except by crooked Hillary and the Democrats all right let's take a look at what we're dealing with when we talk about collusion and obstruction according to merriam-webster collusion is a secret agreement or cooperation especially for an elite fill illegal or deceitful purpose right now the word is being used as a sort of a catch-all term for the Trump administration's alleged ties to Russian meddling and he's only technically right when he says it's not criminal legal experts say under US code collusion is federal crime only applicable under antitrust law that definition according to Cornell law is a collaborative agreement usually secret amongst rivals to prevent open competition through deceptive means in order to gain a market advantage basically it's price-fixing and bid rigging but what is a crime is conspiracy under the federal conspiracy statute a crime is committed when two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States or to defraud the United States or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose it's pretty broad Robert Muller has already used this allegation in this case against former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort now obstruction one of the topics Muller wants to talk to Trump about according to part part of Title 18 of the u.s. code someone obstructs when they corrupt Lior by threats of force endeavor to influence intimidate or impede the due administration of justice accusations of obstruction came fast after Trump tweeted yesterday in part this is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this rigged witch-hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further his lawyer Rudy Julie he denied that this tweet was evidence of obstruction as we said immediately it's an opinion and he used his he used the medium that he uses for opinions Souter and one of the good things about using that is he's established a clear sort of practice now that he expresses his opinions on Twitter he used a word should he didn't use the word Musk and there was no presidential directive to followed it did in direct him he didn't direct him to do it and he's not gonna direct him the door joining me now is Jill wine bags former assistant Watergate special prosecutor Jill there's so much to unpack here first of all the White House yesterday said Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the tweets are presidential opinion this is a new category we've never heard of before yesterday but they are not to be thought of as instruction or Direction even though he's the head of the executive branch I don't buy into that argument at all his words matter and his words whether they're expressed on Twitter or in a speech carry consequences and it's silly to be arguing about did he carefully select a word should do it instead of must do it when your boss says you should do something you know that if you don't do it you're gonna lose your job and so to me you use the words in defining this as influence or intimidate clearly this is in temp to influence and intimidate someone into doing something and all of the president's words recently have been to influence or intimidate the entire investigation to undermine the mulher investigation and I think we ought to stop calling it the Muller investigation we ought to be calling it the Russia investigation and we shouldn't allow the President to determine the words we use he used the word collusion the word is conspiracy is a conspiracy to commit a crime and collusion is simply a synonym for that so we shouldn't be arguing about semantics if the best argument he has is a semantics one he is going to lose so what about Rudy Giuliani's comments that the president has clearly established a pattern of saying all sorts of things by Twitter in recent months he's established a pattern of saying things correct himself correcting himself again walking it back having the White House say it's not really what he meant having Rudy Giuliani go on TV saying it's not really what he meant just some degree does that help the president that he's just one big dust ball of confusion I I don't think anyone wants a president who's just simply one big dust ball I mean we'd like a president who speaks clearly and says what he means his history on Twitter by the way of course includes him hiring and firing people by Twitter and giving orders by Twitter he abolished or tried to abolish Don't Ask Don't Tell and some of the other gender integration issues for the military on Twitter he certainly as twittered about immigration in a way that were orders that he intends to carry out so I don't think we should be arguing about whether he meant should or must I think he intended clearly to disrupt this investigation in the same way that he sent messages to the jury in the Manafort trial that his friend was a good man who had worked for Ronald Reagan and was a darling I think he used the word darling I think these are things that should not be allowed and there is a judge in New York judge Buckwald who has ruled that his Twitter account is a public domain and he cannot block people from it because it is part of the official apparatus of the White House which that speaks to the idea that it is official and what he says things on it it's not mere opinion but now that Muller has apparently agreed to narrow the range of topics for Trump and offer Trump the chance to give written answers what do you think the strategy is I I don't know that the president will ever actually sit down this may all be for show for his audience that oh I really want to do this and that he will ever actually agree to sit down but I also don't really think the prosecutors need him because he is obstructing in plain sight he is communicating openly normally we have to either get wired conversations recordings of them or someone who will testify that the president said something in this case we are all witnessing in the same way that we witnessed what he said when he was with Putin in that press conference to me that was a clear case of his cooperation with Russia and his subservience to Russia and I think we ought to take at face value the things that we actually see and not listen to him when he says don't pay attention don't believe what you see in here those were his words I believe what I see in here hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to
