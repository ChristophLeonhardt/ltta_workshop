00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,659
okay so obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on the camera with</font>

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,120
no makeup and my hair is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not dead I like</font>

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,770
I'm like why do I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get super</font>

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">dressed up to do a YouTube video</font>

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,820
especially when I'm doing once that I

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,380
feel like maybe all five of you were

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,880
gonna wow I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been getting tweets</font>

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,279
comments on videos that I'm nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,710
do with the topic about me reviewing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,439
reboot of the roots and to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,300
yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the sentiment is child</font>

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">additional you know I enjoyed watching</font>

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,230
underground I enjoyed reviewing it

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,179
however y'all didn't really watch the

15
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,570
reviews and that messes up my analytics

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,420
for the month and I took a really big

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,809
hit with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's why</font>

18
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,640
it's really important you thumbs up the

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,649
video that you comment that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

20
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,059
gay copy that this is super super

21
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,890
childish underground<font color="#CCCCCC"> that offset on gift</font>

22
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,469
boxes to people that supported them in

23
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:59,670
that first season not me those four part

24
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,879
series I definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the roots redo</font>

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,739
it was very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's definitely</font>

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,470
worth watching this we all we do is

27
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,420
slave narratives I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,799
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> already you can go watch my first</font>

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">view for underground I discuss it there</font>

30
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,830
is tire is try and it's not sure my

31
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,930
favorite part<font color="#E5E5E5"> was part two I think that</font>

32
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,670
was the one where I was most emotionally

33
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,250
evoked part one and two were really

34
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,470
really good part 3 got a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> Campion</font>

35
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,439
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> for like Chicken George and then ti</font>

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,130
with the veneers it's just I just just

37
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,229
think I like the way they kind of showed

38
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,220
the connection obviously to West Africa

39
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,470
they show kind of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard and how much</font>

40
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a show bow and how much she had to</font>

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,479
fight to maintain any aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his</font>

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,880
culture which I think definitely speaks

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,380
to this conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> one about our</font>

44
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">African Americans appropriating what's</font>

45
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,590
African culture which I wish would just

46
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,939
stop talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it because like</font>

47
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,159
930-10 you're actually putting out your

48
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,840
own African cousins appropriating your

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,579
culture not African Americans but

50
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,100
somehow I life of SS anyone front of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

51
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to it also hits on this idea that</font>

52
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,550
african-american

53
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,070
means either don't have a culture or

54
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,500
that our culture is fade or that we

55
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,230
somehow the onus is on us for the lack

56
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,240
of culture that we have I don't one

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,040
thing after American top-level culture

58
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,900
travel outside the America see how

59
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,420
influential we are now<font color="#E5E5E5"> are this IDR to</font>

60
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,910
this idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that African culture is any</font>

61
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,980
more pure or authentic than

62
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,950
african-american culture especially when

63
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,080
you consider how hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of Kunta</font>

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,870
Kinte had to fight<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me I got kind of</font>

65
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,030
wrapped up in like WIC<font color="#CCCCCC"> Izzy storyline</font>

66
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,440
and feeling like oh my gosh I was a

67
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,810
bright spot like I cared about Kizzy

68
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,490
like this is happy she can read she's an

69
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,760
educated magical black girl and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
the silky how her hair come out so silky

71
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok nevermind that's just you know that</font>

72
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment where you hope you finally found</font>

73
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of joy and it immediately</font>

74
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,770
gets redder than every at every turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

75
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,840
every piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hope that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they held</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

76
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,140
the white man came down and took it<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

77
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">from them like you keep thinking Koontz</font>

78
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,830
is gonna run away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he like he almost</font>

79
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,360
gets there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then he gets caught again</font>

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they chop his todo appreciate</font>

81
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,709
that this version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the roots is a lot</font>

82
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:16,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">more Hollywood so you know there's still</font>

83
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the love story elements they did kind of</font>

84
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,330
the slaves even in their grimy<font color="#CCCCCC"> pneus are</font>

85
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,670
still beautiful they still kind of feed

86
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,160
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mainstream appeal it still kind</font>

87
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,890
of beautifies the period they make up in

88
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessity in having to be visually</font>

89
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,950
pleasing and just being very<font color="#CCCCCC"> honest</font>

90
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,560
about there was nothing joyous or

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,420
enjoyable about the slave narratives and

92
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,250
I've been to plantations in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United</font>

93
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">States and you do constantly hear what I</font>

94
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,450
well at least they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> these log cabins</font>

95
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,860
and nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> really had a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot back then</font>

96
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they you know the whole mammy trove</font>

97
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">it matter what piece of joy you got you</font>

98
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,840
didn't own that joy in at any<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment it</font>

99
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,000
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be taken from you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think part</font>

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,459
to really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of honed in that message</font>

101
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,980
even with specially<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kizzy storyline with</font>

102
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,400
the slave owners niece or daughter

103
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,040
whatever the white girl um I'm a

104
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,170
hardback yellow number child<font color="#E5E5E5"> name but</font>

105
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,180
that child and I almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> believed that</font>

106
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,370
they were genuinely friends like they

107
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they did a damn good job with that</font>

108
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,720
whole sequence and then when the girl

109
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,810
you know even

110
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,700
claiming that she loved kids he'd be

111
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,230
like how could you do this to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

112
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,540
allowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> kazie to be sold like she</font>

113
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,130
didn't put up a fight<font color="#E5E5E5"> for her friend in</font>

114
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,020
the lease this is issue we still have

115
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,270
today the passing on of familial well

116
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,600
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess for a slave who literally oh</font>

117
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,330
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that familial wealth would come</font>

118
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,669
in knowledge and education so in that

119
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:46,280
Kizzy learn how to read but her children

120
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,190
or Chicken George did not learn learn

121
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,260
how to read because Kizzy didn't teach

122
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,970
her son how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read when he was younger</font>

123
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,710
because she wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect him and</font>

124
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,490
keep him from you know losing his limbs

125
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,040
essentially again we look at

126
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,840
african-americans today we have all

127
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,060
these ideas about who they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in</font>

128
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,380
the respectability politics which I to

129
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,360
push on each other and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this coming and</font>

130
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,280
saying that african americans are lazy

131
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,560
and when it really is a system that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

132
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,729
been in place for generations that has

133
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:19,669
led to the state of where we're at today

134
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">i also thought it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really great that</font>

135
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,479
they showed and i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if people</font>

136
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">really caught on to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kizzy the guy</font>

137
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,410
she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sold to that's late master and</font>

138
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,470
I'm him being Irish because so often

139
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,390
especially with the rise of Trump and

140
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,550
yadda yadda yadda people constantly

141
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about well my people with slaves</font>

142
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think they show the duality of</font>

143
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,370
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slave master being Irish and</font>

144
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,060
not fitting in to into the social circle

145
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,789
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other slave masters but he was</font>

146
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:50,270
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as oppressive still disrespectful</font>

147
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,360
did not see blacks as humans like no

148
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,310
matter how much other white disrespected

149
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,889
the slave master he was still<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen as a</font>

150
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:59,539
human being that deserve certain basic

151
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,990
DNI's which he did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> grant to his ways</font>

152
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,389
because they were his face he fell he

153
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:07,250
owned them and he essentially lied to

154
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,139
Chicken George about friends family kind

155
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,460
of mash up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Civil War</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>
