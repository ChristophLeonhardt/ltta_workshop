JIM HAGEDORN IS NOT GOING TO 

558
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:44,516
LET IT HAPPEN AND PRESIDENT 

559
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,850
DONALD J. TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO 

560
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,952
LET IT HAPPEN. 

561
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:47,652
THANK YOU ALL. 

562
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,919
ONTO NOVEMBER AND LET'S WIN 

563
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:51,056
THERE. 

564
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,291
THANK YOU. 

565
00:24:53,291 --> 00:25:00,465
>> WOW. 

566
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,132
ROCHESTER, MINNESOTA, SOUTHERN 

567
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,433
MINNESOTA LOVES THIS PRESIDENT. 

568
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:03,702
ABSOLUTELY. 

569
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,938
THINK BACK WHERE WE WERE JUST 

570
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:18,750
TWO YEARS AGO. 

571
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,818
OUR NATIONS FUTURE WAS ON THE 

572
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:20,018
LINE. 

573
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,186
IF WE HAD NOT WON THAT 

574
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,387
ELECTION, WE WOULD'VE LOST THE 

575
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,021
COUNTRY, THE WAY THE 

576
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,022
FOREFATHERS PUT IT TOGETHER. 

577
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,123
BY THE GRACE OF GOD, MISTER 

578
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:25,957
PRESIDENT YOU ARE HERE. 

579
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,158
THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE 

580
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,294
DOING FOR OUR COUNTRY. 

581
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,961
I JUST WANT TO GIVE THE 

582
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:39,037
PRESIDENT A QUICK UPDATE ON THE 

583
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:39,838
DEMOCRAT PARTY IN MINNESOTA. 

584
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,372
THEY MOVED FAR TO THE LEFT, 

585
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:42,374
LIKE THE REST OF THE DEMOCRATS 

586
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,441
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 

587
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,909
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A GUY RUNNING 

588
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:46,144
FOR GOVERNOR WHO WANTS TO MAKE 

589
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:50,948
MINNESOTA A SANCTUARY STATE. 

590
00:25:50,948 --> 00:25:51,850
WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE RUNNING FOR 

591
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,584
THE U.S. SENATE ON THE DEMOCRAT 

592
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:54,686
PARTY. 

593
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,520
THEY LOVE LATE-TERM ABORTION 

594
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:04,663
AND THEY BELIEVE IN GUN CONTROL.

595
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:05,697
AND WE HAVE ALL THESE 

596
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,230
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES, 

597
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,499
INCLUDING THE GUY I AM RUNNING 

598
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,067
AGAINST, WHO THINK WE SHOULD 

599
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,404
HAVE SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. 

600
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:12,737
SINGLE-PAYER. 

601
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,571
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE FOR THE 

602
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,072
MAYO CLINIC? 

603
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:14,238
NO. 

604
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:15,407
THEY WANT TO RESIST, THEY WANT 

605
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,609
TO TAKE US BACK TO OBAMA AND 

606
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,009
THEN SOME. 

607
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,811
ARE WE GOING TO LET THAT 

608
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,547
HAPPEN? 

609
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:22,947
NO. 

610
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:23,948
MISTER PRESIDENT, WE WILL WORK 

611
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:24,849
TIRELESSLY BECAUSE OF YOUR 

612
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,017
SUPPORT AND LEADERSHIP AND 

613
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:30,255
ENDORSEMENT. 

614
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,890
I WANT TO GO OUT AND SERVE AS A 

615
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,591
CONSERVATIVE REINFORCEMENT TO 

616
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,792
PARTNER WITH YOU TO KEEP MOVING 

617
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:34,726
AMERICA IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. 

618
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,962
THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. 

619
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:41,433
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]  

620
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,802
>> WOW. 

621
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,538
WOW. 

622
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:51,009
GOOD TALENT. 

623
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:51,943
SO JASON AND JIM ARE BOTH 

624
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,010
RUNNING AGAINST EXTREME 

625
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:58,717
DEMOCRATS. 

626
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,619
JIM'S OPPONENT SUPPORTS A TOTAL 

627
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,552
GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF 

628
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:07,125
HEALTHCARE, WHICH DRIVES COSTS 

629
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,226
RIGHT THROUGH THE ROOF AND THE 

630
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,696
HEALTHCARE IS LOUSY, BY THE WAY.

631
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:16,768
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]  AND HE 

632
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:20,805
WANTS TO MAKE MINNESOTA INTO A 

633
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,607
SANCTUARY FOR THE CRIMINAL 

634
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:26,411
ALIENS AND FOUR GANG MEMBERS. 

635
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:30,982
THEY WILL COME FLOODING APPEAR, 

636
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,751
AS SOON AS YOU DO, IT HAPPENS 

637
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,820
EVERY TIME. 

638
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,453
JASON'S OPPONENT, ANGIE CRAIG, 

639
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:41,526
WHO IS SHE? 

640
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,560
ALSO ONCE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR 

641
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:42,860
HEALTHCARE. 

642
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,231
SHE REFUSES TO SUPPORT THE 

643
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:46,498
PIPELINE. 

644
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,868
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT. 

645
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,336
THAT WOULD BRING MORE THAN 8000 

646
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,437
JOBS TO MINNESOTA. 

647
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,971
YOU KNOW WE HAVE REALLY OPENED 

648
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:56,541
UP MINNESOTA. 

649
00:27:56,541 --> 00:28:00,912
YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH 

650
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,613
THE MINES AND THE MINORS AND 

651
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:03,281
THE ORDER. 

652
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:10,288
WORST OF ALL, A VOTE FOR THEM 

653
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,623
IS A VOTE FOR NANCY PELOSI AS 

654
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,925
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. 

655
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,059
CAN YOU IMAGINE NANCY PELOSI AS 

656
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,527
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE? 

657
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:20,131
DON'T DO THAT TO ME. 

658
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,000
I DID NOT BUY INTO THAT. 

659
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,003
NEITHER DID YOU. 

660
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:29,207
IF DEMOCRATS TAKE CHARGE, 

661
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:33,578
MAXINE WATERS WILL ALSO -- 

662
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,580
LISTEN TO THIS. 

663
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,114
SHE WILL TAKE OVER FINANCIAL 

664
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:39,017
SERVICES IN CONGRESS. 

665
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,186
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 

666
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:45,223
MAXINE WATERS. 

667
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,357
THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST 

668
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:51,730
POWERFUL COMMITTEES IN CONGRESS.

669
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,231
IF YOU WANT TO STOP PELOSI FROM 

670
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:53,765
BECOMING SPEAKER. 

671
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:54,866
IF YOU WANT TO STOP CHUCK 

672
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,200
SCHUMER FROM BECOMING MAJORITY 

673
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,936
LEADER. 

674
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,639
AND IF YOU WANT TO STOP THE 

675
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:02,640
RADICAL DEMOCRATS FROM RUNNING 

676
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,843
CONGRESS, THEN YOU NEED TO VOTE 

677
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:08,679
REPUBLICAN. 

678
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:09,914
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT THERE ON 

679
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,950
NOVEMBER 6 AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. 

680
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,351
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE 

681
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,087
FOR THESE PEOPLE. 

682
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,589
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 

683
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,458
A DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED CONGRESS 

684
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,260
WOULD ALSO CAUSE A GRAVE THREAT 

685
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,329
TO MEDICARE. 

686
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,530
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING 

687
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,497
WITH MEDICARE. 

688
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:33,504
THEY WILL DESTROY IT. 

689
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:34,439
THE MAJORITY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS 

690
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,373
HAVE COSPONSORED A SOCIALIST 

691
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,841
TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE THAT 

692
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:37,508
WOULD OBLITERATE MEDICARE. 

693
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:39,077
THEIR PLAN IS CALLED MEDICARE 

694
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,712
FOR ALL. 

695
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:45,049
EXCEPT THEY HAVE NO MONEY. 

696
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,251
BUT IT IS REALLY MEDICARE FOR 

697
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:46,451
NONE. 

698
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,885
THEIR PLAN WOULD ROB AMERICAN 

699
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:54,792
SENIORS OF THE BENEFITS THEY 

700
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:55,193
HAVE PAID. 

701
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,394
THEY PAID THESE BENEFITS. 

702
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,896
THEY PAID SO MUCH MONEY FOR 

703
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,465
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. 

704
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,299
YOU TAKE IT AWAY. 

705
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:01,766
THANK YOU, DARLING. 

706
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:05,270
I LOVE THESE PEOPLE. 

707
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,638
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT 

708
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:12,577
MEDICARE FOR OUR SENIORS WHO 

709
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:15,079
HAVE EARNED IT AND PAID FOR IT. 

710
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,614
AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT 

711
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:20,818
AMERICANS WITH PRE-EXISTING 

712
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:21,118
CONDITIONS. 

713
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:22,853
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF 

714
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:25,256
THEM. 

715
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:30,762
SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN 

716
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:31,428
TALKING ABOUT ENDING PRE-

717
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:40,271
EXISTING CONDITIONS AND I SAY, 

718
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,673
LET'S GET A LITTLE MORE MONEY 

719
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,707
FROM CHINA, IT WILL BE JUST 

720
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:43,007
FINE. 

721
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,908
IT WILL BE JUST FINE. 

722
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,544
IT WILL BE JUST FINE. 

723
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:47,979
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF 

724
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:48,579
PRE-EXISTIN CONDITIONS, 

725
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:49,012
REMEMBER THAT. 

726
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:55,320
THE LEAD SPONSOR OF THE 

727
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,953
DEMOCRATS, THE HEALTHCARE 

728
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:57,388
TAKEOVER, WHO IS THE LEAD 

729
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,389
SPONSOR? 

730
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,958
I HAVE BEEN READING SO MUCH 

731
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:03,061
ABOUT HIM. 

732
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,529
HE DID PREDICT I WAS GOING TO 

733
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:04,729
WIN. 

734
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,397
THAT IS THE ONLY THING HE GOT 

735
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:06,698
RIGHT. 

736
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,065
KEITH ELLISON. 

737
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,634
NO, HE DID. 

738
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:10,001
THAT'S RIGHT. 

739
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:15,406
HE WAS ON THE SHOW THE DAY 

740
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:16,007
AFTER I ANNOUNCED. 

741
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,943
ON JUNE 16, I CAME DOWN WITH 

742
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:19,877
MELANIA, WHO IS NOW IN AFRICA, 

743
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:20,478
OUR FIRST LADY. 

744
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,982
DOING A GREAT JOB FOR THE 

745
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,517
PEOPLE OF AFRICA. 

746
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:26,783
AMAZING. 

747
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:28,353
BUT ELLISON WAS ON THE SHOW THE 

748
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,654
DAY AFTER I ANNOUNCED AND HE 

749
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:35,326
LOOKED AT THE HOSTS AND HE 

750
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,295
SAID, YOU KNOW HE IS GOING TO 

751
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,296
WIN, DON'T YOU? 

752
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,630
AND THEY SMILED. 

753
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:45,103
ONE LAUGHED. 

754
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,471
THEY THOUGHT I WAS JUST DOING 

755
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:46,904
THIS FOR FUN. 

756
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,306
DO YOU THINK THIS IS FUN? 

757
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:49,340
THIS IS A LOT OF WORK. 

758
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,342
A LOT MORE WORK THAN ANYBODY 

759
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:51,542
KNEW. 

760
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,977
THAT IS THE LAST TIME HE HAS 

761
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,412
BEEN RIGHT, BUT I AM GLAD HE 

762
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,382
WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT. 

763
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,483
ELLISON IS THE NUMBER TWO 

764
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:59,850
OFFICIAL IN THE ENTIRE DEMOCRAT 

765
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,088
PARTY AND HE RECENTLY MARCHED 

766
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,723
IN A PARADE WEARING A SHIRT 

767
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:13,331
THAT SAID I DO NOT BELIEVE IN 

768
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:13,798
BORDERS. 

769
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:14,365
THAT IS WONDERFUL. 

770
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,868
IF YOU DON'T HAVE BORDERS, YOU 

771
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:17,335
DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. 

772
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:22,240
YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. 

773
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,041
KEITH ELLISON'S DEMOCRAT PARTY 

774
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,275
EMBRACES RADICAL SOCIALISM AND 

775
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,277
OPEN BORDERS. 

776
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,311
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE 

777
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:32,617
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS TO ABOLISH 

778
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,284
I.C.E. 

779
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,052
THEY WANT TO UNLEASH VIOLENT 

780
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:34,686
PREDATORS AND RUTHLESS KILLERS 

781
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,588
AND YOU KNOW IT. 

782
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,023
SOMEONE WOULD SAY, WHY IS HE 

783
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:39,356
SAYING THAT? 

784
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:42,126
IT IS TRUE. 

785
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:46,631
LIKE MS-13. 

786
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,064
NEAR OUR SCHOOLS. 

787
00:32:47,064 --> 00:32:48,266
NEAR OUR FAMILY SEND INTO OUR 

788
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,000
COMMUNITIES. 

789
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,803
NO GOOD. 

790
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:56,974
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE AMERICA 

791
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:58,609
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-

792
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,744
ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT CRIMINAL 

793
00:33:00,744 --> 00:33:03,047
ALIENS. 

794
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,751
AND REPUBLICANS PROUDLY STAND 

795
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:11,723
WITH THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF 

796
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,056
I.C.E., BORDER PATROL AND LAW 

797
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:16,928
ENFORCEMENT. 

798
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:17,595
OUR POLICE. 

799
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:17,928
GREAT PEOPLE. 

800
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:20,665
THEY DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 

801
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,133
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO 

802
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,035
REFORMED OUR REFUGEE PROGRAM TO 

803
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,404
PROTECT AMERICAN COMMUNITIES 

804
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,440
LIKE YOU HAVE IN MINNESOTA, 

805
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,642
WHERE YOU ARE BEING TREATED 

806
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:38,549
VERY UNFAIRLY. 

807
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:39,450
AND TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILIES 

808
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,251
AND YOUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS. 

809
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,719
IF YOU WANT SECURITY. 

810
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,722
IF YOU WANT A BORDER, THAN WHAT 

811
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,324
YOU HAVE TO DO IS IMMEDIATELY 

812
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,893
GO OUT, THINK ABOUT IT, GET 

813
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:52,530
YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR NEIGHBORS. 

814
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,131
YOU HAVE TO GO NOVEMBER 6, VOTE 

815
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:57,435
REPUBLICAN. 

816
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,336
YOU HAVE TO DO IT. 

817
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,338
WE NEED THE VOTES. 

818
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:05,910
I KEEP HEARING WE HAVE A 

819
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,244
MAJORITY. 

820
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,245
IF SOMEBODY HAS A COLD, WE 

821
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,714
DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY. 

822
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,547
IF SOMEONE IS NOT FEELING 

823
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:16,621
GREAT, WE DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY.

824
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,054
THAT IS WHY WE ARE GETTING THE 

825
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:19,456
WALL, BY HOOK AND BY CROOK, BUT 

826
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:24,228
IT IT IS -- BUT IT IS SO 

827
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:24,527
DIFFICULT. 

828
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:27,998
THESE GUYS WANT TO STOP IT. 

829
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:29,233
WE GOT $700 BILLION FOR THE 

830
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:29,500
MILITARY. 

831
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,469
WE ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY. 

832
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:41,879
BUT TO GET MONEY FOR THE WALL, 

833
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:42,914
THEIR WHOLE LIFE IS TRYING TO 

834
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,848
OBSTRUCT THE WALL, BECAUSE THEY 

835
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:44,782
KNOW WE WANT IT. 

836
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,083
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS NOT 

837
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:46,350
WORKING. 

838
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:53,991
I WOULD LIKE TO DO IT A LOT 

839
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,226
FASTER, BUT IT IS NOT WORKING. 

840
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,226
YOU THINK IT IS EASY? 

841
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:57,061
IT IS NOT EASY. 

842
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,462
WE ARE GETTING IT BUILT AND IT 

843
00:34:58,462 --> 00:34:59,697
IS ALREADY GOING UP IN SAN 

844
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:00,898
DIEGO AND LOTS OF OTHER PLACES 

845
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:01,699
ALONG THE BORDER. 

846
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:02,533
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT SAFETY 

847
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,368
AND IT IS ABOUT PROSPERITY. 

848
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:05,836
SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE 

849
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:08,805
CREATED OVER 400 MILLION NEW 

850
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:09,807
JOBS. 

851
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:14,679
THE MEDIA WILL TELL YOU THERE 

852
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,547
IS NO WAY WE COULD HAVE SAID 

853
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:22,553
THAT DURING THE CAMPAIGN. 

854
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:23,254
NOBODY WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT. 

855
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,555
AND WE HAVE LIFTED 4 MILLION 

856
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:25,489
AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. 

857
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:31,796
THINK OF THAT. 

858
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,297
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU 

859
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,632
SAVE A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU 

860
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,400
ALSO MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE 

861
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,369
REALLY HAPPY. 

862
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,570
WE HAVE ADDED NEARLY A HALF 1 

863
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,608
MILLION NEW MANUFACTURING JOBS. 

864
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,542
REMEMBER, YOU NEED A MAGIC 

865
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,776
WAND, YOU WILL NEVER DO THAT. 

866
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:49,246
I SAID WHAT'S THE MATTER, WE 

867
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:50,081
NEVER BUILD ANYTHING ANYMORE? 

868
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,916
WE HAVE COMPANIES POURING INTO 

869
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:52,449
OUR COUNTRY. 

870
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:52,850
INTO MINNESOTA. 

871
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,554
WE HAVE COMPANIES COMING BACK. 

872
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,588
THEY WANT TO BE WHERE THE 

873
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:57,989
ACTION IS. 

874
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,190
THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. 

875
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,193
THE AUTO COMPANIES. 

876
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:07,665
I WAS WITH PRIME MINISTER ABE A 

877
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:14,605
COUPLE DAYS AGO. 

878
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:15,840
HE SAID MANY OF THE AUTO 

879
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,641
COMPANIES ARE COMING BACK. 

880
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,042
I SAID THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH, 

881
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,277
THEY ALL HAVE TO COME BACK. 

882
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,278
THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. 

883
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:20,711
THEY HAVE STARTED. 

884
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,980
WHAT IS COMING -- WHAT IS GOING 

885
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,749
ON IN MICHIGAN, THEY ARE COMING 

886
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:25,616
BACK SO FAST. 

887
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:29,453
SOUTH CAROLINA, NORTH CAROLINA. 

888
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,788
THEY ARE COMING INTO A PLACE 

889
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:31,188
CALLED MINNESOTA. 

890
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:36,961
WE LOVE MINNESOTA. 

891
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:43,067
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]  

892
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,670
>> 1972, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? 

893
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:53,010
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME. I CAME 

894
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:53,678
SO CLOSE. 

895
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,612
I WOULD HAVE WON THIS STATE. 

896
00:36:54,612 --> 00:37:04,522
DO YOU REMEMBER? 

897
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,023
I SAID, I THINK I AM GOING TO 

898
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:06,624
WIN MINNESOTA. 

899
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:07,858
EVERYONE SAID NO, NO, IT HAS 

900
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,126
NOT BEEN ONE SINCE 1972. 

901
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:12,830
RIGHT? 

902
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,331
YEAH, 1972. 

903
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,165
IT HAS NOT BEEN ONE. 

904
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,900
I SAID, NO, LOOK AT THE CROWDS. 

905
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,236
THEY LOVE IT. 

906
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,638
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF 

907
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:21,739
MINNESOTA AND STOP WHAT IS 

908
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,273
HAPPENING THAT IS SO UNFAIR IN 

909
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:26,410
MINNESOTA. 

910
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,813
AND THEN ON ELECTION NIGHT I 

911
00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:31,649
SAID LET'S GO TO MINNESOTA. 

912
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:39,023
THEY ALREADY SCHEDULED A GREAT 

913
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:39,757
PLACE, A GREAT STATE, MICHIGAN. 

914
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,158
THAT IS ANOTHER ONE THAT HAD 

915
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,893
NOT BEEN ONE IN MANY YEARS. 

916
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:43,694
I WENT TO MICHIGAN. 

917
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:44,628
WE HAD 32,000 PEOPLE IN 

918
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:53,003
MICHIGAN AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING.

919
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:53,737
I HAD TO SKIP MINNESOTA. 

920
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:54,739
I FELT SO BADLY. 

921
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:55,773
ONE MORE SPEECH, I COULD HAVE 

922
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,210
SHOWN UP AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING 

923
00:37:59,210 --> 00:37:59,844
AND GOT THEM. 

924
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,145
BUT WE ARE GOING TO WIN. 

925
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:04,315
WE ARE GOING TO WIN MINNESOTA. 

926
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:05,650
YOU SEE THAT, JUST BY THIS 

927
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:05,883
CROWD. 

928
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:09,520
LOOK AT THIS CROWD. 

929
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,292
SO SOMETHING I AM VERY PROUD OF

930
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,060
. AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 

931
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,695
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE 

932
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:22,199
EVER RECORDED. 

933
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:22,799
AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS 

934
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:30,775
REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER 

935
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:31,042
RECORDED. 

936
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:31,709
THINK OF THOSE TWO SOUNDBITES. 

937
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,643
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT, THE 

938
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,744
LOWEST RATE OF POVERTY. 

939
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:34,712
THINK OF THIS. 

940
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:39,517
HOW DOES YOUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN 

941
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:43,788
VOTE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE? 

942
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,256
I HAVE DONE MORE FOR THEM IN 

943
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:45,556
TWO YEARS. 

944
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:46,457
AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE COMING UP 

945
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,758
AND SAYING, MISTER PRESIDENT, 

946
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:54,698
THANK YOU. 

947
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:55,800
AND THEIR MEDIAN INCOME IS THE 

948
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,066
HIGHEST. 

949
00:38:56,066 --> 00:38:58,569
NOT ONLY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, 

950
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,738
ASIANS, HISPANICS. 

951
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:08,078
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]  

952
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:15,720
>> HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE 

953
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,654
LOWEST IT HAS EVER BEEN. 

954
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,254
THINK OF IT. 

955
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,055
ASIAN UNEMPLOYMENT, THE LOWEST 

956
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:23,761
IT HAS EVER BEEN. 

957
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:24,762
PEOPLE WITH NO HIGH SCHOOL 

958
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,796
DIPLOMA, THAT IS A VERY 

959
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:26,964
IMPORTANT GROUP OF PEOPLE TO 

960
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:28,432
ME, IT IS BY FAR THE LOWEST IT 

961
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:31,569
HAS EVER BEEN. 

962
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:32,470
WOMEN I AM FAILING WITH. 

963
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:37,107
I AM FAILING WITH WOMEN. 

964
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:38,809
IT IS ONLY THE LOWEST IN 65 

965
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,310
YEARS. 

966
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:39,877
SORRY. 

967
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,079
SORRY. 

968
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,283
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]  I 

969
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:50,654
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HISTORY BY 

970
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,823
NOW, BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SAYING 

971
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:56,694
AFRICAN-AMERICAN HERE. I'VE 

972
00:39:56,694 --> 00:40:00,297
BEEN SAYING ASIAN. 

973
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,366
AND WOMEN, ONLY THE LOWEST IN 

974
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:02,967
65 YEARS. 

975
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,568
I THOUGHT BY NOW IT WOULD BE 

976
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:04,801
OKAY. 

977
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:06,737
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

978
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:12,676
THANK YOU. 

979
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,178
A LOT OF ENERGY OVER THERE. 

980
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,112
SHE HAS A LOT OF ENERGY. 

981
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:15,713
THANK YOU, DARLING. 

982
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:16,180
THANK YOU. 

983
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,318
65 YEARS, NOT BAD. 

984
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,453
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN THE 

985
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,586
TOUGHEST EVER ACTION, CRACKING 

986
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:28,959
DOWN ON CHINA'S TRADE ABUSES. 

987
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:33,631
WE HAVE TO STOP IT. 

988
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:34,431
WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 

989
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:34,764
RELATIONSHIP. 

990
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:38,202
I HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP,

991
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,470
BUT WE CAN'T ALLOW WHAT HAS 

992
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,238
HAPPENED OVER SO MANY YEARS TO 

993
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:42,506
CONTINUE HAPPENING. 

994
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:43,340
THEY HAVE TAKEN $500 BILLION 

995
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:53,117
OUT OF OUR COUNTRY AND REBUILT 

996
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:53,417
CHINA. 

997
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,752
I SAID WE CAN'T DO THAT 

998
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:55,352
ANYMORE, I AM SORRY. 

999
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:55,986
I AM SORRY. 

1000
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,555
FOR YEARS, CHINA HAS BEEN 

1001
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:58,055
DRAINING US. 

1002
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:58,822
TAKING OUR FACTORIES AND 

1003
00:40:58,822 --> 00:41:00,391
BUILDING UP THEIR COUNTRY, WITH 

1004
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,059
OUR MONEY. 

1005
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,494
AND AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR 

1006
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,930
WORKERS AND OUR COMPANIES. 

1007
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,965
WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT. 

1008
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,768
NO MORE. 

1009
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:14,471
AND NOT ONLY CHINA, MANY 

1010
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,674
COUNTRIES. 

1011
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,309
WE DEFEND COUNTRIES THAT ARE 

1012
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:23,881
VERY RICH. 

1013
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,015
THEY DON'T PAY US OR THEY PAY 

1014
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,050
US A SMALL PERCENTAGE. 

1015
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,051
LOOK, WE GET ALONG GREAT WITH 

1016
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:27,651
THESE COUNTRIES. 

1017
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,521
BUT TAKE SAUDI ARABIA, WE 

1018
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,289
DEFEND THEM AND THEY PAY A 

1019
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:35,993
SMALL PERCENTAGE. 

1020
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,527
I SAID EXCUSE ME, KING SOLOMON, 

1021
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:38,128
HE IS MY FRIEND. 

1022
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,663
DO YOU MIND PAYING FOR THE 

1023
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:39,930
MILITARY? 

1024
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,032
DO YOU MIND? 

1025
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:46,103
HEY. 

1026
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:51,408
THEY ARE PAYING FOR 30%. 

1027
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:52,609
I SAID DO YOU MIND PAYING? 

1028
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:54,545
BUT NOBODY HAS ASKED ME. 

1029
00:41:54,545 --> 00:42:00,150
I SAID, BUT I AM ASKING YOU. 

1030
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,784
HE HAS GREAT. 

1031
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:01,886
HE SAID, ARE YOU SERIOUS? 

1032
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:05,656
I SAID NO, I AM TOTALLY SERIOUS.

1033
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:06,524
TRUST ME. 

1034
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,291
AND THEY WILL DO IT. 

1035
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,759
HE SAID NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED 

1036
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:09,927
THEM. 

1037
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:10,761
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE TALKING 

1038
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,195
ABOUT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF 

1039
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:15,432
DOLLARS. 

1040
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,233
PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD NEVER 

1041
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,867
HAVE ASKED, THAT IS NOT HIS 

1042
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:21,972
THING. 

1043
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,107
WHY WOULD SOMEONE ASK TO BE 

1044
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,107
PAID BACK BILLIONS OF DOLLARS? 

1045
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:25,609
JAPAN, VERY RICH, VERY GREAT 

1046
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,778
COUNTRY. 

1047
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:28,612
PRIME MINISTER ABE, A GREAT 

1048
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:29,346
MAN. 

1049
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:35,552
JUST ONE FANTASTIC COLLECTION. 

1050
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:36,987
I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. 

1051
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,522
I SAID TO HIM, LISTEN, WE ARE 

1052
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,291
DEFENDING YOU. 

1053
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,425
WE ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. 

1054
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,459
THEY WERE SENDING MISSILES OVER 

1055
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:46,563
JAPAN FROM NORTH KOREA. 

1056
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:47,297
BECAUSE OF ME, THOSE AREN'T 

1057
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:48,131
GOING OVER JAPAN ANYMORE. 

1058
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:49,433
THERE ARE NO MORE MISSILES, NO 

1059
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:52,736
MORE TESTING, NO MORE NUCLEAR. 

1060
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:59,743
WE HAVE OUR HOSTAGES BACK. 

1061
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,878
WE GET THE REMAINS OF OUR GREAT 

1062
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:01,845
HEROES BACK. 

1063
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,381
THERE REMAINS. 

1064
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,683
THE REMAINS ARE COMING BACK. 

1065
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:06,950
IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL 

1066
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,852
CEREMONY. 

1067
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,154
DID ANYONE SEE THAT CEREMONY A 

1068
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:10,721
MONTH AGO? 

1069
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:11,188
SO BEAUTIFUL. 

1070
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:16,660
THE REMAINS ARE COMING BACK. 

1071
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,361
WHAT DO I GET? 

1072
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,896
I GET THE FAKE NEWS SAYING, WHY 

1073
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:22,333
ISN'T HE MOVING FASTER? 

1074
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,467
THREE MONTHS AGO I HAD A 

1075
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:24,067
MEETING IN SINGAPORE. 

1076
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:25,936
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 75 

1077
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,870
YEARS. 

1078
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,105
LET'S SAY 25 YEARS WITH THE 

1079
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,740
MISSILES AND THE NUCLEAR, BUT 

1080
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,341
NO PRESIDENT HAS DONE ANYTHING. 

1081
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:35,412
IT IS LIKE THREE MONTHS. 

1082
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:36,780
THEN THEY WILL SAY THE ALL-TIME 

1083
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,952
GREAT, WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG? 

1084
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,387
I SAID IT HAS BEEN THREE MONTHS 

1085
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:44,588
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ROCKETS AND 

1086
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:45,823
YOU DON'T HAVE MISSILES AND YOU 

1087
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:46,623
DON'T HAVE NUCLEAR TESTING. 

1088
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:47,324
IT IS CRAZY. 

1089
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:55,966
BUT HERE IS WHAT THEY SAY. 

1090
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:56,867
THEY CAN'T GET ME. 

1091
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,402
ONE OF THEM, A NICE GUY, A 

1092
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,803
FRIEND OF MINE SAID, WHY IS THE 

1093
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,171
PRESIDENT GIVING SO MUCH TO 

1094
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,039
NORTH KOREA? 

1095
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:02,639
I HAVEN'T GIVEN ANYTHING. 

1096
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,408
I DIDN'T PAY $1.8 BILLION FOR 

1097
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,478
THE HOSTAGES, LIKE OBAMA DID. 

1098
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,446
$1.8 BILLION IN CASH. 

1099
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:13,617
SO I HAVE NOT GIVEN, BUT I HAVE 

1100
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,052
A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH 

1101
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:15,452
CHAIRMAN KIM. 

1102
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:22,692
I HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

1103
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:23,994
BECAUSE OF THAT, I THINK WE 

1104
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:24,928
WILL WORK SOMETHING OUT. 

1105
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:26,330
MAYBE WE WELL, MAYBE WE WON'T, 

1106
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:26,930
BUT LET'S SEE. 

1107
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:27,865
THREE MONTHS AGO, MAYBE LESS 

1108
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:32,136
AND THEY ARE SAYING, HE AGREED 

1109
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:32,703
TO MEET. 

1110
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:41,745
YOU KNOW WHAT I GAVE HIM? 

1111
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,113
I AGREED TO MEET, THAT IS WHAT 

1112
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:43,580
THEY SAID. 

1113
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,515
IS THAT A BIG DEAL? 

1114
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,416
I AGREED TO MEET. 

1115
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,550
I ASKED THE DEMOCRATS. 

1116
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,185
WE WERE CLOSE TO A WAR WITH 

1117
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,486
NORTH KOREA AND MY RHETORIC WAS 

1118
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,055
VERY TOUGH AT THE BEGINNING. 

1119
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,623
REALLY, REALLY TOUGH. 

1120
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,057
IN FACT, THEY ALL SAID, I AM 

1121
00:44:54,057 --> 00:44:55,692
GOING TO CAUSE A WAR WITH NORTH 

1122
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:55,925
KOREA. 

1123
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:57,327
THEN WITH PUTIN OF RUSSIA, HE 

1124
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:00,998
SAID -- THEY SAID, HE WAS TOO 

1125
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,599
NICE. 

1126
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,568
THEY WANT ME TO GET INTO A 

1127
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:05,636
BOXING MATCH WITH HIM. 

1128
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:09,406
I THINK I WOULD DO VERY WELL. 

1129
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,875
WITH RUSSIA. 

1130
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,210
NO. 

1131
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,878
IT IS THE FAKE NEWS. 

1132
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:20,484
FAKE NEWS. 

1133
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,485
THEY SAID WITH RUSSIA, HE WAS 

1134
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:21,885
TOO NICE. 

1135
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,120
WITH NORTH KOREA, THEY SAID HE 

1136
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,591
WAS TOO TOUGH. 

1137
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:27,991
TOO TOUGH. 

1138
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,426
LET ME TELL YOU, IF I WAS 

1139
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,627
REALLY ROUGH WITH RUSSIA,THEY 

1140
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:31,628
WOULD SAY HE WAS TOO TOUGH. 

1141
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,497
THESE PEOPLE ARE LOCO, I AM 

1142
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,632
TELLING YOU. 

1143
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:41,572
PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. 

1144
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,172
FAKE NEWS. 

1145
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:42,772
THE FAKE NEWS, EVERYBODY. 

1146
00:45:42,772 --> 00:45:43,874
THEY ARE FAKE. 

1147
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:47,144
AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING, 

1148
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,948
FOREIGN NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY 

1149
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,583
REBUILDING OUR NATION. 

1150
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,819
RIGHT? 

1151
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:56,920
TO GIVE OUR WORKERS AND 

1152
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:04,828
BUSINESSES A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD

1153
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:05,361
. REPUBLICANS PASSED THE 

1154
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:06,997
BIGGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND 

1155
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,166
TAX REFORMS IN THE HISTORY OF 

1156
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:16,306
OUR COUNTRY. 

1157
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:17,507
BETTER VOTE FOR KARIN HOUSLEY, 

1158
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:18,709
THEY WANT TO TAKE THEM AWAY.  

1159
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,744
THEY WANT TO TAKE THEM AWAY. 

1160
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:25,982
WE HAVE TAKEN HAS STORE AND -- 

1161
00:46:25,982 --> 00:46:27,150
TAKEN HISTORIC ACTION TO MAKE 

1162
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,953
HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE. 

1163
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,188
AND THE PREMIUMS UNDER 

1164
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:36,860
OBAMACARE, THEY WERE GOING UP 

1165
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:37,661
116%. 

1166
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,897
138%. 

1167
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,732
200%. 

1168
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:42,532
THROUGH GREAT MANAGEMENT AND 

1169
00:46:42,532 --> 00:46:44,201
GREAT PEOPLE, WE HAVE KEPT THEM 

1170
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:45,068
DOWN. 

1171
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:51,241
WE MOSTLY OBLITERATED OBAMACARE,

1172
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,442
ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T WON, EXCEPT 

1173
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,578
2:00 IN THE MORNING. 

1174
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,213
KNOWS I AM NOT GOING TO DO IT, 

1175
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:57,681
TO A CLOCK IN THE MORNING. 

1176
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:02,853
BUT THINK OF IT DIFFERENTLY. 

1177
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,054
WE DIDN'T GET ONE DEMOCRAT 

1178
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:05,255
VOTE, SO WE ARE STUCK WITH IT, 

1179
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:11,061
BUT IT IS OBLITERATED. 

1180
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:12,696
THE BIG THING IS WE GOT RID OF 

1181
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,164
THE MOST UNPOPULAR PART, THE 

1182
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,933
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, WHERE YOU 

1183
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,067
HAVE A PRIVILEGE OF PAYING A 

1184
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,268
FORTUNE, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO 

1185
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,103
PAY A FORTUNE FOR HORRIBLE 

1186
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:23,273
HEALTHCARE, RIGHT? 

1187
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:26,376
1025 SO THE PREMIUMS IN 

1188
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,980
MINNESOTA THIS YEAR ARE COMING 

1189
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,681
DOWN BY DOUBLE DIGITS. 

1190
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,017
THINK OF THAT. 

1191
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,619
I DO NOT EVEN LIKE THE STUFF, 

1192
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:43,260
BUT WHILE WE HAVE THE REMNANTS 

1193
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,294
OF OBAMACARE, WE ARE LOOKING TO 

1194
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:45,295
MAKE IT MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE 

1195
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,763
THEN YOU HAD AND TO REDUCE DRUG 

1196
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:46,996
PRICES. 

1197
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:48,131
THE FDA HAS APPROVED A RECORD 

1198
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,432
NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE GENERIC 

1199
00:47:49,432 --> 00:47:51,401
MEDICINES. 

1200
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,202
THAT IS NOT ALL. 

1201
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:57,441
DRUG PRICES ARE COMING DOWN. 

1202
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,275
YOU MIGHT'VE SEEN LAST MONTH 

1203
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:01,912
WHERE I CALLED UP SOME OF THE 

1204
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:02,612
DRUG COMPANIES. 

1205
00:48:02,612 --> 00:48:03,380
YOU RAISED THE PRICES, YOU 

1206
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,916
CAN'T DO THAT. 

1207
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,584
AND THEY ALL REDUCED THEM. 

1208
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,753
YOU BELIEVE IT? 

1209
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,288
THAT IS WHEN I SAID, I HAVE A 

1210
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:14,024
LOT OF POWER. 

1211
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:14,758
PFIZER, NOVARTIS, THEY RAISED 

1212
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:21,765
THEIR DRUG PRICES AND I AM 

1213
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:22,466
BRINGING THEM DOWN. 

1214
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,700
I SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH 

1215
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,201
RAISING THEM? 

1216
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:29,239
I AM SORRY MISTER PRESIDENT, WE 

1217
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:29,973
WILL REDUCE THEM IMMEDIATELY. 

1218
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:30,974
MAN, THIS IS A POWERFUL 

1219
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:31,241
POSITION. 

1220
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,376
THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY 

1221
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:35,912
OF DRUG COMPANIES THAT THEY 

1222
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:36,312
HAVE DONE THAT. 

1223
00:48:36,312 --> 00:48:37,714
I CALLED THEM AND TOLD THEM I 

1224
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:38,415
WAS EXTREMELY UNHAPPY. 

1225
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,616
THEY SAID THEY WOULD REDUCE IT. 

1226
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:40,150
WHO DOES THAT? 

1227
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,151
DO YOU THINK HILLARY CLINTON 

1228
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:41,952
WOULD HAVE DONE THAT? 

1229
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:48,258
I DON'T THINK SO. 

1230
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:54,164
[ CROWD CHANTING ]  

1231
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:59,636
>> BY THE WAY, SHE OR WHOEVER 

1232
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:02,039
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN, CRAZY 

1233
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,273
BERNIE, WHOEVER THEY PUT IN, 

1234
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,242
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE ANY OF 

1235
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:07,444
THE THINGS. 

1236
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,545
WE DID THE GREATEST TRADE DEAL. 

1237
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:09,346
WE DID 4.2% GDP. 

1238
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:13,250
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD -4%. 

1239
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:20,957
THEY SAID 4.2% WAS IMPOSSIBLE. 

1240
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,392
IT IS GOING TO GO MUCH HIGHER. 

1241
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,794
WE HAVE SUCH POTENTIAL BETWEEN 

1242
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,729
MILITARY AND TRADE DEALS. 

1243
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:26,964
WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF 

1244
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,331
DOLLARS WORTH OF FAT AND 

1245
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:31,902
POTENTIAL. 

1246
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:32,969
AND WHAT I LOVE, WHAT I LOVE, 

1247
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,471
HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T NEED IT FOR 

1248
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,908
A LONG TIME OR NEVER, TO HELP 

1249
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,176
CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS GET 

1250
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:40,010
LIFE-SAVING TREATMENTS, WE 

1251
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,813
PASSED RIGHT TO TRY. 

1252
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,148
I LOVE IT. 

1253
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,984
I HOPE YOU DON'T NEED IT. 

1254
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:51,221
I HOPE I DON'T NEED IT, TOO. 

1255
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,223
I HOPE YOU DON'T NEED IT, BUT 

1256
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:56,526
WE HAVE THE GREATEST, FRANKLY 

1257
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,095
THE GREATEST DRUG COMPANIES IN 

1258
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:06,269
THE WORLD. 

1259
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,270
AND WE HAVE DRUGS THAT WOULD 

1260
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,571
TAKE FOUR OR FIVE YEARS. 

1261
00:50:08,571 --> 00:50:09,506
WE BROUGHT IT DOWN FROM 14 

1262
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,274
YEARS TO GET APPROVED, DOWN TO 

1263
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:13,043
FOUR YEARS. 

1264
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,678
I THINK WE WILL GET IT DOWN TO 

1265
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,178
THREE OR TWO. 

1266
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,613
BUT STILL, YOU HAVE TO WAIT A 

1267
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:17,114
LONG TIME. 

1268
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:20,684
A PERSON WAS DYING, THEY ARE 

1269
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,918
TERMINALLY ILL AND THEY HAVE A 

1270
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:22,519
POSSIBLE CURE. 

1271
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,420
A PERSON WANTS TO SEE. 

1272
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,189
THERE WAS NO WAY OF GETTING IT. 

1273
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:26,990
I WORKED WITH CONGRESS, 

1274
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:31,461
INCLUDING THESE GUYS. 

1275
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:31,895
AND GREG. 

1276
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:32,729
AND GREG. 

1277
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,998
RIGHT? 

1278
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:39,636
AND JIM AND MARK AND THE WHOLE 

1279
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:40,170
GROUP. 

1280
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,371
WE WORKED WITH CONGRESS AND WE 

1281
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:41,972
GOT IT DONE. 

1282
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:47,043
I LOVE THE NAME, RIGHT TO TRY. 

1283
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:47,944
NOW, THEY CAN GO. 

1284
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:49,079
YOU HAVE NO IDEA, THEY HAVE 

1285
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,348
BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS FOR 40 

1286
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:51,781
YEARS. 

1287
00:50:51,781 --> 00:50:55,786
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR 40

00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:32,749
>> I WILL GIVE YOU A QUICK 

1470
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:33,950
STORY THAT THEY DON'T KNOW, 

1471
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,651
THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD. 

1472
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:35,485
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. 

1473
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:36,953
I THOUGHT THEY KNEW EVERYTHING 

1474
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:42,192
ABOUT ME. 

1475
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,326
IN MAKING THE DEAL WITH MEXICO 

1476
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:43,726
AND CANADA. 

1477
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:45,261
AS YOU KNOW, CANADA WAS VERY 

1478
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:48,498
TOUGH BUT THEY WORKED OUT FINE. 

1479
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,033
WE TALK ABOUT IT AND I AM NOT 

1480
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,668
HAPPY WITH IT, THE NFL, OKAY? 

1481
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,437
PEOPLE SHOULD STAND, PROUDLY, 

1482
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:58,308
FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM. 

1483
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,309
SO I AM NOT HAPPY. 

1484
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,779
I AM NOT HAPPY. 

1485
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,513
BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING 

1486
00:58:04,513 --> 00:58:06,282
OUT. 

1487
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,483
DID YOU NOTICE, THAT SEEMS TO 

1488
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:11,654
BE WORKING OUT VERY GOOD. 

1489
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,222
SO, WE ARE MAKING THE DEAL WITH 

1490
00:58:13,222 --> 00:58:15,825
CANADA AND IT IS BIG STUFF. 

1491
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:16,826
IT IS CARS AND FARMING AND 

1492
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:24,133
AGRICULTURE AND FACTORIES AND 

1493
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:24,868
BIG, BIG DOLLARS. 

1494
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:25,168
TREMENDOUS. 

1495
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,169
THEY SAY IT IS THE LARGEST 

1496
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,503
TRADE DEAL EVER MADE. 

1497
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:31,641
$1.3 TRILLION. 

1498
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,443
BUT I HEARD THE NFL HAD A BIG 

1499
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:34,277
PROBLEM WITH CANADA ON THEIR 

1500
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:34,610
ADVERTISING. 

1501
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:35,111
ON THE COMMERCIALS. 

1502
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,547
A BIG, BIG PROBLEM. 

1503
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,382
I WON'T GET INTO IT, IT WAS A 

1504
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:39,916
VERY BAD PROBLEM. 

1505
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:46,689
IT WAS REALLY HURTING THE NFL. 

1506
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,390
I DON'T CARE. 

1507
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,424
IT IS AN AMERICAN COMPANY. 

1508
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:49,125
A GREAT AMERICAN COMPANY. 

1509
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,126
SO DURING THE NEGOTIATION, I 

1510
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,761
SAID YOU HAVE TO FIX THE NFL 

1511
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:52,028
PROBLEM. 

1512
00:58:52,028 --> 00:59:01,070
THEY SAID WHAT?  

1513
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:02,505
IT TOOK ME TWO MINUTES AND NOW 

1514
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:03,706
THE NFL IS SO HAPPY. 

1515
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,607
IT HAS ALL WORKED OUT. 

1516
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:05,541
IT HAS ALL WORKED OUT. 

1517
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:06,442
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT. 

1518
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:07,377
IT HAS ALL WORKED OUT. 

1519
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:13,082
GOT TO FIX IT. 

1520
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:14,417
AND OUR COUNTRY WILL TAKE TENS 

1521
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:15,652
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MORE 

1522
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:15,885
MONEY. 

1523
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,453
A LOT OF IT WILL GO TO THE 

1524
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:18,588
PLAYERS AND THEY STILL HATE ME, 

1525
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:19,489
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 

1526
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:20,924
THINK OF IT, IT TOOK ME TWO 

1527
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:21,190
MINUTES. 

1528
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:25,795
YOU HAVE TO FIX THE PROBLEM. 

1529
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,096
NOT BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THEM, 

1530
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:27,730
I DO LIKE THEM. 

1531
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,032
IT IS A GREAT AMERICAN COMPANY. 

1532
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,667
I SAID YOU HAVE TO FIX THE NFL 

1533
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:30,933
PROBLEM. 

1534
00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:32,201
IT IS UNFAIR WHAT YOU DO TO 

1535
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,769
THEM DURING THE SUPER BOWL. 

1536
00:59:33,769 --> 00:59:35,605
VERY UNFAIR. 

1537
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,040
AND I GOT A CALL FROM ROGER 

1538
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,874
GOODELL. 

1539
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:38,040
NO. 

1540
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:43,312
VERY NICE. 

1541
00:59:43,312 --> 00:59:44,781
I FIGURED HE WAS CALLING ABOUT 

1542
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:45,782
THE FLAG, TO SAY, COULD YOU 

1543
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:51,054
LEAVE US ALONE PLEASE? 

1544
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:51,421
AND HE WASN'T. 

1545
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,121
HE SAID MISTER PRESIDENT, I 

1546
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:53,322
WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR 

1547
00:59:53,322 --> 00:59:54,123
WHAT YOU DID. 

1548
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,158
YOU SOLVED A PROBLEM THAT WAS 

1549
00:59:55,158 --> 01:00:00,597
GOING ON FOR YEARS. 

1550
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,197
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 

1551
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:01,731
COULDN'T DO IT. 

1552
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:02,465
NOBODY COULD DO IT. 

1553
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:06,402
NO ONE COULD GET IT DONE. 

1554
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:07,503
I DID IT IN TWO MINUTES. 

1555
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:08,705
YOU HAVE TO DO IT. 

1556
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:11,474
IT WAS A TINY PART OF THE DEAL. 

1557
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:12,575
I FIGURED, IT WAS ONLY TWO 

1558
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:12,975
SENTENCES. 

1559
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:17,180
IT WAS VERY NICE. 

1560
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,114
ROGER GOODELL CALLED ME, THEN 

1561
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,148
BOB KRAFT. 

1562
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:22,752
A GREAT OWNER. 

1563
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:23,786
IT IS GREAT TO HAVE COACH 

1564
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,787
BELICHICK AND TOM BRADY. 

1565
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:35,631
THAT IS A GOOD THING. 

1566
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:36,999
I SAY YOU ARE A GREAT OWNER AND 

1567
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:38,201
ONE OF THE LUCKIEST MAN ON 

1568
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:38,434
EARTH. 

1569
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:39,836
TOM BRADY IN THE SIXTH ROUND. 

1570
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:40,837
AND YOU HAVE THE GREATEST COACH 

1571
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:41,337
IN FOOTBALL. 

1572
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:42,839
THAT IS A GREAT THING AND HE IS 

1573
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:43,473
A GREAT GUY. 

1574
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,108
BUT HE CALLED ME TO THANK ME 

1575
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,209
AND ROGER GOODELL CALLED ME TO 

1576
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:46,509
THANK ME. 

1577
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:47,443
WE ARE ALL FRIENDS. 

1578
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:48,845
I WANT WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE 

1579
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:49,112
COUNTRY. 

1580
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:55,284
IT IS TRUE. 

1581
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:56,486
ONE OF MY KILLERS CALLED UP. 

1582
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,420
WE HAVE TOUGH NEGOTIATORS. 

1583
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:57,820
SMART GUYS. 

1584
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:04,227
LIKE THE A-TEAM OF THE WORLD. 

1585
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:05,728
HE SAID, YOU KNOW, THE NFL, 

1586
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:06,562
EVERYBODY KNEW ABOUT IT FOR 

1587
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:06,795
YEARS. 

1588
01:01:06,795 --> 01:01:08,064
HE SAID I THINK WE COULD FIX 

1589
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:08,898
THAT NFL DEAL. 

1590
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:14,036
I SAID, LET'S FIX IT. 

1591
01:01:14,036 --> 01:01:14,971
THEY SAID, REALLY, YOU WANT TO 

1592
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:15,438
DO THAT? 

1593
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:18,307
THEY ARE A GREAT AMERICAN 

1594
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:19,108
COMPANY. 

1595
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:20,143
THEY WILL PAY TAXES ON THAT 

1596
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:20,376
MONEY. 

1597
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:21,544
THEY WILL PAY PEOPLE WHO LIVE 

1598
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:23,779
AND WORK IN OUR COUNTRY. 

1599
01:01:23,779 --> 01:01:24,313
I SAID FIX IT. 

1600
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,783
THEY FIXED IT AND IT WAS A NICE 

1601
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:27,183
THING. 

1602
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,184
OKAY, ENOUGH OF THAT. 

1603
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:32,655
THAT IS ENOUGH OF THAT, REALLY. 

1604
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:33,456
SO, THE NFL. 

1605
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:33,789
GOOD COMPANY. 

1606
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:42,699
GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE. 

1607
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,833
WE ARE LIFTING MILLIONS OF OUR 

1608
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:44,834
CITIZENS, YOU KNOW THIS, FROM 

1609
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:45,434
WELFARE TO WORK. 

1610
01:01:45,434 --> 01:01:46,301
FROM DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE 

1611
01:01:46,301 --> 01:01:47,269
AND FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. 

1612
01:01:47,269 --> 01:01:51,307
THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. 

1613
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:52,708
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE COMING 

1614
01:01:52,708 --> 01:02:01,083
OUT OF PRISONS AND THEY ARE 

1615
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,017
ABLE TO GET JOBS NOW. 

1616
01:02:02,017 --> 01:02:02,417
ISN'T THAT GREAT? 

1617
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:03,419
THEY ARE GETTING A SECOND 

1618
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:04,654
CHANCE AND EVEN A THIRD CHANCE 

1619
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:08,524
AND THEY ARE GETTING JOBS. 

1620
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:09,625
PEOPLE THAT ARE HIRING, MANY OF 

1621
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:10,526
THESE PRISONERS ARE SAYING, 

1622
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:11,460
UNBELIEVABLE HOW GOOD THEY ARE. 

1623
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:15,431
BEFORE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE A 

1624
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:15,932
CHANCE. 

1625
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:16,933
THEY ARE HIRING PEOPLE COMING 

1626
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,234
OUT OF PRISON AND THESE PEOPLE 

1627
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:18,935
ARE STEPPING UP. 

1628
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,703
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HIRED QUITE 

1629
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:27,877
A FEW AND HE SAID THESE PEOPLE 

1630
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:28,811
ARE UNBELIEVABLE. 

1631
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:29,378
THEY ARE SO HARD-WORKING. 

1632
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:30,480
WE HAVE GIVEN THEM A SECOND 

1633
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:30,746
CHANCE. 

1634
01:02:30,746 --> 01:02:34,817

1635
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:39,388

1830
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:22,818
ENTIRE 28 YEAR LEGAL CAREER. 

1831
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:24,019
I AM WONDERING A COUPLE OF 

1832
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:24,320
THINGS. 

1833
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,654
THAT WOULD SEEM TO SUGGEST 

1834
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:26,522
THERE MAY BE CONCERN ON THE 

1835
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:27,690
PART OF THE JUDGE OR DON 

1836
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:28,724
McGANN, THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL 

1837
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:29,992
HELPING HIM THROUGH THIS 

1838
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,561
PROCESS, THAT IN FACT THE ISSUE 

1839
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:33,662
OF TEMPERAMENT MIGHT BE ONE 

1840
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:38,534
GIVING SOME SENATORS PAUSE. 

1841
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:39,668
DO YOU THINK AN OP-ED LIKE THIS 

1842
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:40,769
COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO 

1843
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:41,870
THOSE SENATORS WHO MAY BE ON 

1844
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:42,905
THE FENCE? 

1845
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:46,942
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. 

1846
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:48,377
I THINK YOU REALLY HIT THE NAIL 

1847
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:49,078
ON THE HEAD. 

1848
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,612
I THINK WHAT IS GOING ON AS HE 

1849
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:51,846
FELT HE NEEDED AND HIS ADVISORS 

1850
01:10:51,846 --> 01:10:53,682
FELT HE NEEDED TO DO A BIT OF 

1851
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,117
AMY A CALL BUT, BECAUSE OF HIS 

1852
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:56,017
TONE AT THAT HEARING. 

1853
01:10:56,017 --> 01:11:00,789
HE WAS GETTING WIDELY CRITICIZED

1854
01:11:00,789 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR IT AND THERE
