there seems to be some sort of bragging
rights about the ability to function on
less sleep than other people in fact we
know now through science and through a
lot of anecdotal evidence that
eventually there's going to be a price
to pay so if someone like Trump can
survive on four hours of sleep a night
or even less than that there's going to
come a reckoning point where there will
be a health crisis or accidents or who
knows but for the long-term it is really
unhealthy to try to survive on such
little sleep
