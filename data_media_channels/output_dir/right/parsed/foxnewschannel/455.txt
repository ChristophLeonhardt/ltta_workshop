STEVE: SUPREME COURT NOMINEE
BRETT KAVANAUGH COMMITTED TO
COOPERATING WITH THE FBI DURING
THEIR INVESTIGATION.
AINSLEY: BUT AS ALAN DERSHOWITZ
WARNS IN A NEW
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" OP-ED IF
KAVANAUGH GETS DISQUALIFIED OVER
FALSE ACCUSATIONS IT WILL SET A
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT.
BRIAN: JOINING US RIGHT NOW,
HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR, AUTHOR OF
THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING
TRUMP, ALAN DERSHOWITZ.
ALAN, YOU SAID I WANT THE FBI TO
LOOK INTO.
DO YOU THINK ANYTHING CHANGES
AFTER THESE FIVE DAYS IF THINGS
CAN'T BE PROVEN?
>> WELL I HOPE THEY LOOK INTO IT
CAREFULLY.
I THINK THEY OUGHT TO
PARTICULARLY LOOK INTO THE
SWETNICK AFFIDAVIT PRODUCED BY
MICHAEL AVENATTI.
THAT IS THE MOST SERIOUS ONE,
CHARGING WITH HIM GANG RAPE,
STANDING ON A LINE, WAITING TO
RAPE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN
DRUGGED.
I THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO
INVESTIGATE THAT BECAUSE IF IT
TURNS OUT THAT WAS MADE UP OUT
OF WHOLE CLOTH, IT PUTS THE LIE
TO THE NOTION THAT YOU SHOULD
BELIEVE ALL VICTIMS, THAT NO
WOMEN EVER LIE.
THAT NOTHING IS MADE -- IF IT
TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE, THAT IS
CLEARLY DISQUALIFYING.
SO I WOULD GET TO THAT CLEARLY
AND DECISIVELY.
AINSLEY: WHO DO YOU BELIEVE?
YOU BASED ON, YOU SAW HER ON
CAMERA WITH MICHAEL AVENATTI.
YOU SAW HIM IN THE HEARING THAT
IS A FARCE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
THIS WOMAN?
>> WELL YOU HAVE TO, SHE SAYS
SHE HAS WITNESSES TO CONFIRM IT.
MICHAEL AVENATTI HAS WITNESSES
BUT WON'T NAME THEM.
THE FBI OUGHT TO GO TO AVENATTI.
AVENATTI SHOULD WAIVE ANY LAWYER
CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND LET THE FBI
FIND OUT WHAT THE ORIGINAL STORY
WAS.
WHETHER IT WAS CHANGED AS THE
RESULT OF COORDINATION WITH HIM
OR WITH OTHER PEOPLE.
LOOK, YOU KNOW THE MYTH OUT
THERE THIS IS JOB INTERVIEW.
NONSENSE.
IF IT WAS A JOB INTERVIEW YOU
DON'T START WITH JOB INTERVIEW
HALF THE POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS
SAYING THEY WON'T HIRE YOU UNDER
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
ONCE A PERSON IS ACCUSED
PUBLICLY OF SPECIFIC, FOCUSED
CRIMES THAT ARE
CAREER-DESTROYING, THAT JOB
INTERVIEW METAPHOR DISAPPEARS.
YOU HAVE TO PROVE THE
ALLEGATIONS BY CLEAR AND
CONVINCING EVIDENCE WITH DUE
PROCESS.
STEVE: RIGHT.
>> IMAGINE IF THE SITUATION WERE
DIFFERENT?
IMAGINE IF A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT
PRESIDENT APPOINTED THE FIRST
MUSLIM-AMERICAN TO THE SUPREME
COURT, SOMEBODY SAID, OH, YEAH,
I REMEMBER HE WAS A TERRORIST
WHEN HE WAS 17.
THE ACLU WOULD BE ALL OVER THIS
CASE.
NO YOU CAN'T PRESUME GUILT OF
TERRORISM.
EVERYBODY WOULD BE SAYING THE
BURDEN OF PROOF IS SO HEAVILY
BUT WHEN THE SHOE IS ON THE
OTHER FOOT, WHEN IT IS A WHITE
MAN BEING ACCUSED BY THE LEFT OF
SEXUAL OFFENSES ALL THE RULES
ARE CALLED OFF.
THE RULES OF PRESUMPTION OF
INNOCENCE.
THE RULES OF DUE PROCESS.
WE KNOW HE IS GUILTY BECAUSE HE
IS A WHITE MAN, SHE'S A WOMAN,
SHE IS A SURVIVOR.
THAT IS THE END OF THE INQUIRY.
STEVE: ALAN, EXIT QUESTION, IF
NO NEW INFORMATION IS
DISCOVERED, DOES IT GET
CONFIRMED, QUICKLY?
>> IT IS UP TO FOUR PEOPLE.
AND I WOULD THINK IF NO NEW
EVIDENCE COMES OUT, THEN THE
BURDEN OF PROOF HASN'T BEEN
SATISFIED AND BECAUSE THIS WAS
PUT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN, HE
