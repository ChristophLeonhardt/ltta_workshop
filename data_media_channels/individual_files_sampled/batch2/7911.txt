joining us now a guy who is fighting us corporate Democrats and Republicans in the middle of Kansas planting the progressive flag Brent welder running the third District of Kansas Brent choices again Brett good to see you brother how you doing okay great great it's so good to be back I've been missing you guys it's been I think a month and a half or something Wow I was gonna breath it - I know right hey John how's it going right this is so for those who don't remember brent is a wonderful progressive user Bernie Sanders delegate and and the what he proposed was a resolution for the Democratic Party to stand up to call for an amendment to get money out of politics they rejected it but I love that you fought on that he's also was a volunteer for Wolf Pack and a toi team member and last we checked in he was there was a poll that said that he was beating his Republican opponent by 7 points so we want to get the the latest on that and and Brent before you even start I want to show people we were raising money for Brent because he helped us raise money for this studio and for our reporters etc and I want to check in on TYT Kansas comm and I want to do that throughout the night because I know we're trying to raise $50,000 for your fine from before yeah okay full screen now put it on out there at full screen there you go okay so we want to make sure that he can have organizers to organizes volunteers on the grassroots level so if you guys can can you show us we were trying to get 52 RT Kansas comm 40% 116 not bad not bad can I see fifty thousand tonight can I see fifty thousand sighs let's finish it let's get in the volunteers he needs let me say I should have mentioned at the beginning I am with you live from our new field office right behind me we literally just opened it this week we've hired a several field staffers since last time I checked in with you guys and it's all because of you and another update we actually last quarter raised more money than any democratic challenger in the history of our district and the the previous record was 215,000 we raised two hundred and forty thousand dollars and forty thousand of that at the time was from the TYT army so literally the TYT army broke that record for us and if you guys hadn't helped us out there's no way we could have done it and you know I just appreciate everything you guys are doing I really do that that's one of them and so Brett you're I don't lucky whatever it might be that you got a poll in your district because a lot of people don't even get a poll and polls showed that you're in fantastic shape so I'm curious what's happened since then since you're beating the incumbent by seven points have any of the other primary opponents dropped out or or the and and um this is a real question I don't know Democratic Party would be crazy not to support you that is a very winnable district and voted for Bernie in the primaries Hillary Clinton in the in the general election and you're already beating the incumbent in the polling and so I should be helping you and I'm not this is not a setup I really don't know have they actually come in to support you yet well you know we lead in cash on hand we lead in volunteers we have had been endorsed by every major progressive organization locally and nationally and you know clearly I think we have the best message we're running on Medicare for all $15 minimum wage so you would think sounds like a pretty good candidate for the Dems get behind we're already defeating at the Republican incumbent by the largest margin of any Democratic challenger in the country but know that the Democratic field has been growing I think the establishment is in recruiting more people I literally now am running against a Wall Street banker that said that what they want when they get into Congress they want to serve on a committee that allows them to be the ones regulating Wall Street imagine that so we are in the fight of our lives right now even though we are leading in cash on hand it's very very close money-wise and you know it's a very expensive race we're in one of the you know one of the counties in my area is one of the wealthiest counties in the country and there's a lot of money rolling in for The Wall Street banker who's also a self funder as well as other corporate Democrats not to mention the Republicans so there's no way we can be doing this with the strength that we are without your guys's help so thank you so much for that man that is unreal I even at this late stage I'm still a little naive even though we've covered it eight ways to Sunday and I know it but I mean if you don't help the Democrat with the largest margin against an incumbent Republican are you really the Democratic Party and so they're obsessed with finding conservatives and bankers and and you have more money it makes you say that's supposed to be the thing they always say well you know I mean they got more funding we've gotta support them but I tell you guys what we have the chance to do here okay when okay when I when I first got into this race people told me I was crazy no candidate in Kansas history as ever you know tried to run on this kind of extremely progressive agenda you know to focus completely on a grassroots campaign they said it couldn't be done they said we couldn't raise the money and I remember when that poll came out and I and I actually got a chance to speak to you Jenk about it and I remember what you said you said I said you know this is amazing can you believe it this is this is unreal you know this is unbelievable and you said no it's believable you said you know I you told me and you reminded me that the first time I came on your show you told me that this was gonna happen and that the whole reason that we are winning by so much is because we're proving that a bold progressive agenda representing regular people instead of the giant corporations is not only good policy which it obviously is but it's also really good electoral and it's the reason that we're running such a strong campaign and now you know this the we have this huge hurdle in the primary and you know that the differences between me and my primary opponents could not be more clear we basically have a group of people that are trying to out conservative one another out right-wing one another they want to you know be the ones regulating Wall Street when they were frankly you know part of the problem when they were working for Wall Street and we have me who you know worked as a volunteer for Wolf Pack was the one who wrote the amendment for the Democratic National platform to try to say that as a party we will stand to get corporate money out of politics that amendment failed narrowly and I you know made the decision then that washington needs to change the politicians in washington to change and frankly it's not a problem of just the and party it's a pro it's a problem across Washington of all political parties but we can really make a difference and when we elect a progressive in the state of Kansas it's gonna turn heads nationwide and people are gonna see that progressive policies are not just good policy but also really good electoral E as well yeah there's some progressive candidates out there that are so super strong and that's why Brent when you were first on I was like man this guy's got winner written off and so but a big test of that tonight is Greg Edwards in Pennsylvania and then there's Allison arts in California and these are the ones that that I think look I believe in strength and they were they're strong they're fighting for progressives instead of Mary Wilson in Texas Adrienne Bell in Texas there's some really strong candidates that I think I carry that progressive flag proudly what the Democratic Party wants it or not and so TYT Kansas calm is is to donate I we gotta get over fifty thousand tonight and then Brent your website tell everybody what your website is so they can check out your positions Brent welder calm Brit with an end welder like the job you know I'll mention I know Greg Edwards one thing that I think the TYT army should know is that a lot of us progressive justice Democrats from around the country actually stay in touch we chat with each other and communicate and talk about strategy and and kind of you know push each other along and I was out in DC with Greg Edwards and a number of other progressive candidates and we were actually lighting up Paul Ryan and we dropped thousands tens of thousands of signatures at his office door on some important policies at the time and I actually spoke with Greg Edwards this morning to wish him luck today and he said that they have knocked 60,000 doors and made 60,000 phone calls because of the strength of you know the progressives across the country and people like the TYT army and supporters of Justice Democrats that he's able to do that and if you go to Brant welded on comm you can figure out how to volunteer to find out friends positions and then get in the fight if you're in the third District of Kansas you're near there get out there knock on doors make calls etc now Brent and one of your opponents had the funniest campaign of slogans I'd ever seen we got another one that was great one of the incumbent Democrats running again suggests Democrat in Illinois was Danny Davis the name you know that's it I'm not gonna do anything for you but it's just the name you know and but tell folks the slogans of your Democratic opponents well i and it you know he's a he's a friend of mine and a nice guy see him on the trail but we have some real serious disagreements policy-wise obviously his slogans include leading from the middle and the courage to compromise but you know I'll say there there is you know maybe there is a lot of I don't know if I'd call it misinformation or kind of like you know wrong thinking out there that the way to win in districts like this for instance in the state of Kansas is to act like a Republican but you know we're we're proving that that's absolutely not the case and the Democrats in this district haven't won this congressional district for ten years and they've been trying to run candidates that are corporatists at a republican light and it hasn't worked it hasn't worked it hasn't worked and now you know as we've talked about we are pulling so strongly against the Republican incumbent and I know if we can get through this tough primary we're gonna you know prove to the entire country that you know we don't need capitulation we don't need moving to the right we don't need to be a little bit like Donald Trump we need a clear break from the Republican failed policies the the way that they're going and we need to prove exactly to everybody how we're gonna help working people and and you know we're gonna do it all right so Brent last couple of things here and by the way I do want to check in on T RT cos calm before we go and what I love is the individual donor number so if we can get that up so $3 $7 $27 whatever you can you wanna do more bless your heart let's get to 50,000 and put a real progressive in the Congress from Kansas but so I you just gave me an update on so let people know when the primary is and then an update on your volunteers so part of the reason you were raising the money is for the volunteers we see the new office but do you have any other news on that yes we I was just checking in with my field director just before I came on with you guys and we have hundreds of volunteers we've been knocking thousands of doors and making and we've made even six times more phone calls and we have knock doors because we yet you know over the winter we were doing a lot of calls we have two field offices now four field staffers and if people go to Brent weld or comm slash volunteer that's the places I have to volunteer and I've mentioned this before on this show every time we get volunteers in the office my favorite thing to do is go around and meet every single one of them talk to them for a while get a picture with them and the thing I always do is ask them where did you find out about us and literally half of our volunteers come to us through either TYT or justice democrats and it makes a huge difference it just with us being able to get out there and talk to thousands and thousands of voters every week every month hearing my name actually the the Kansas City Star just followed me around knocking doors and did a whole story about how strong our field operation is and you know people are really starting to realize this is this is really the way to get it done I love it so when's the primary in Kansas Oh August 7 okay so you've got a while oh the other dudes are in a lot of trouble your pipe hitting volunteers a couple hundred of them going door-to-door I was poor sumbitches trying to leave from the middle anyway all right before Brent goes let me see TYT cans count one more time let me see where it is oh you don't know yeah sometimes takes a while up it's always a lag but it's I hear to you it's I always say this every time it's significantly higher than that we have less than $3,000 to go to our goal let's get it done I can't do it without you and literally every single donation counts we've actually gotten over 9,500 donations in this campaign so far and I get an email every single time so if you send it I'll see your name and whether it's two dollars or five dollars or ten dollars or twenty seven dollars whatever it is it all adds up because when there's thousands and thousands of people across the country in all 50 states donating your your donation is 99 thousand times bigger than and whatever you you did yeah and that is an enormous amount of individual donors in a in a district in the middle of Kansas so Brent weld are fighting the good fight keep going brother and hopefully we'll see you on the night of August 7th and then in an early week in November okay thank you so much and good luck to my fellow justice Dems and progressives around the country tonight and let's keep the fight going guys we're gonna do this this is amazing we're changing the country right before it right before everyone's eyes all right wonderful and if you're watching this interview later on YouTube or Facebook all the links for Brent will be down below you just click on them all right Thank You Brett
