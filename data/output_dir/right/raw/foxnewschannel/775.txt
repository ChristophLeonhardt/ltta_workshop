1
00:00:00,691 --> 00:00:01,658
IN VAIN.

2
00:00:01,658 --> 00:00:04,862
WE WILL SECURE OUR BORDERS.

3
00:00:04,862 --> 00:00:05,729
>> Juan: MUCH MORE ON THAT

4
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:06,897
LATER IN THE SHOW.

5
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:08,465
FIRST, WE WANT TO REMEMBER A

6
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:10,734
LEGEND AND A FRIEND.

7
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:11,668
DR. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER WHO

8
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:13,203
PASSED AWAY YESTERDAY AT THE

9
00:00:13,203 --> 00:00:15,739
AGE OF 68 AFTER A BATTLE

10
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:16,140
WITH CANCER.

11
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,608
>> THE BIG ESTHERER THAT WE

12
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:19,343
MAKE IS TO LOSE THE DAMN WAR

13
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:20,544
BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO

14
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:23,047
RECOGNIZE WHO THE ENEMY IS

15
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:23,881
AND WHAT IT REQUIRES.

16
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,416
FOR GOD'S SAKE WHY DO YOU

17
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,451
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

18
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:31,522
THE MOURNING IS OVER, THE

19
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:32,389
CHIVA IS DONE.

20
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:33,290
IF YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE

21
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,159
YOU SHOULD BE OPTIMISTIC.

22
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,727
>> I THINK IT WILL SNOW IN

23
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:38,195
HELL BEFORE THE DOJ IS GOING

24
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:39,263
TO GO AFTER HER.

25
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:41,298
WE ALL WERE EXPECTING IT.

26
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:41,899
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

27
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,767
THAT WAS THE DOG THAT DIDN'T

28
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:44,134
BARK.

29
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:44,802
>> Juan: CHARLES WAS THE

30
00:00:44,802 --> 00:00:45,602
LEADING CONSERVATIVE THINKER

31
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:46,937
OF HIS GENERATION TO MANY.

32
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:48,172
HE TOUCHED SOME OF OUR LIVES

33
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:49,540
RIGHT HERE AT THE FOX NEWS

34
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:49,873
CHANNEL.

35
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:51,809
I GOT TO TELL YOU, I OFTEN

36
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,077
FOUND MYSELF ON THE OPPOSITE

37
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:54,311
END OF THE OPINION FENCE

38
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:54,878
FROM KRAUTHAMMER.

39
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:55,979
THAT WAS THE CASE FOR JUST

40
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:58,782
ABOUT A DECADE ON "SPECIAL

41
00:00:58,782 --> 00:00:59,116
REPORT."

42
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:02,352
CHARLES WAS ALSO, LIKE ME, A

43
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:03,554
HUGE BASEBALL FAN.

44
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:05,355
AND LAST NIGHT CHARLES WAS

45
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:06,790
HONORED AT NATIONALS PARK IN

46
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,095
D.C.

47
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:14,064
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF

48
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:15,699
FOX ASK ME ABOUT CHARLES.

49
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:17,067
I THINK IT'S VERY HARD

50
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:18,802
SOMETIMES TO EXPLAIN TO THEM

51
00:01:18,802 --> 00:01:20,237
HOW HE TOUCHED SO MANY OF

52
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:20,504
US.

53
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:22,506
HOW COULD ALL YOU GUYS KNOW

54
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:22,840
HIM?

55
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,708
BUT JESSE HAD A VERY SPECIAL

56
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:25,342
RELATIONSHIP.

57
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:26,276
JESSE, EXPLAIN.

58
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:30,047
>> WELL, I WAS THE PRODUCER

59
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:31,115
FOR THE O'REILLY FACTOR FOR

60
00:01:31,115 --> 00:01:32,783
MANY YEARS AND IT WAS MY

61
00:01:32,783 --> 00:01:34,685
GREAT HONOR TO PRODUCE

62
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:35,953
EXRAWT FOR ABOUT FIVE OF

63
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:36,386
THOSE YEARS.

64
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:37,654
SO ONCE A WEEK I WOULD GET

65
00:01:37,654 --> 00:01:38,989
ON THE PHONE WITH

66
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:41,725
DR. KRAUTHAMMER AND I WOULD

67
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:43,227
TRIBE

68
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:43,260
TRANE

69
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,162
TRANSCRIBE POINTS ABOUT BILL

70
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:46,563
TOPICS FOR THAT NIGHT.

71
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:47,698
I WOULD ABSORB THE TALKING

72
00:01:47,698 --> 00:01:48,765
POINTS AND GO TO THE BAR

73
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:50,567
LATER AND REPEAT THEM AS IF

74
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:53,036
THEY WERE MY OWN.

75
00:01:53,036 --> 00:01:53,770
[LAUGHTER]

76
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,404
TO SOUND SMART.

77
00:01:54,404 --> 00:01:55,906
I LOVED DOING IT I ALSO

78
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:58,142
REMEMBER FOR YEARS I WOULD

79
00:01:58,142 --> 00:01:58,775
DVR "SPECIAL REPORT."

80
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:00,110
AND THEN I WOULD FAST

81
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,278
FORWARD TO THE ALL-STAR

82
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:02,346
PANEL AT THE END.

83
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:04,047
FAST FORWARD THROUGH YOU, NO

84
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:04,414
OFFENSE.

85
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:04,781
[LAUGHTER]

86
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:05,916
AND THEN I WOULD JUST LISTEN

87
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,451
TO CHAMPLETS THE DIFFERENCE

88
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:08,785
WITH CHARLES COMPARED TO ANY

89
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:10,854
OTHER COMMENTATOR WHEN HE

90
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:12,089
SPOKE, EVERYTHING WENT

91
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:12,389
QUIET.

92
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:13,457
AND YOU LISTENED.

93
00:02:13,457 --> 00:02:14,825
AND YOU NEVER INTERRUPTED

94
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:15,559
CHARLES.

95
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,493
NOT EVEN O'REILLY

96
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:17,194
INTERRUPTED CHARLES.

97
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:18,896
AND THAT'S A PRETTY TALL

98
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:19,630
ORDER.

99
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,033
EVEN MY LIBERAL MOTHER LIKED

100
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:23,700
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER BECAUSE

101
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,801
HE HAD A WAY ABOUT HIM.

102
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,737
HE WAS SO RATIONAL AND

103
00:02:26,737 --> 00:02:27,137
RESPECTFUL.

104
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:28,872
HE WAS NEVER DISAGREEABLE.

105
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:30,274
YOU COULD ALWAYS KIND OF AS

106
00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:31,308
A LIBERAL DISAGREE WITH HIM

107
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:33,076
BUT NOT HATE HIM AND HE WAS

108
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:34,478
NEVER EVER ATTACKED IF YOU

109
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:36,580
EVER REALIZED FROM THE LEFT.

110
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,282
AND IT SHOWS THE KIND OF THE

111
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:40,617
DEPTH OF HIS POWER BECAUSE

112
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:43,220
HE WAS HONORED BY GEORGE W.

113
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,088
BUSH, THE NATIONALS,

114
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:45,756
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU.

115
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:47,591
I HAD FRIENDS TEXTING ME

116
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:49,660
RANDOMLY I'M SO SORRY TO

117
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,661
HEAR ABOUT CHARLES.

118
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:52,196
HE HAD SUCH A GREAT IMPACT.

119
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:53,564
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I

120
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:54,631
MET HIM FACE TO FACE.

121
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,300
I WAS IN THE D.C. BUREAU AND

122
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,768
JUST COME BACK FROM ONE OF

123
00:02:57,768 --> 00:03:01,205
THOSE CRAZY WATTERS WORLDS I

124
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:02,239
WAS COCKY AND ROLLED INTO

125
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,774
THE GREEN ROOM AND CHARLES

126
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:06,076
IN THAT LOW TONE JESSE,

127
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:07,377
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

128
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:08,545
ALLOWING MY TO BE IN YOUR

129
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:08,845
WORLD.

130
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:10,847
AND HE SAID IT WITH A WINK

131
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:11,548
AND A SMILE.

132
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:14,218
IT JUST REALLY MADE ME

133
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:14,685
LAUGH.

134
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:15,419
>> Juan: KENNEDY, WE WERE IN

135
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:16,353
THE GREEN ROOM AND YOU SAID

136
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:17,387
SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT CHARLES

137
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:18,622
MEANT TO YOU THAT REALLY

138
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:19,723
CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE.

139
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:21,024
I WAS TAKEN BY IT.

140
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:21,992
IT WAS WONDERFUL.

141
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:24,194
>> THERE IS SOMETHING SO

142
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:24,995
INCREDIBLY POSITIVE ABOUT

143
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:27,731
WHAT HE DID WHICH WAS HE

144
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:29,433
OPENED A WINDOW OF MOURNING

145
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:30,801
AND LET PEOPLE IN ON THE

146
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:31,835
KNOWLEDGE THAT HE DID NOT

147
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:33,503
HAVE LONG LEFT IN THIS

148
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:33,837
WORLD.

149
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:35,973
AND THERE'S SOMETHING SO

150
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,507
SWEET AND HONORABLE ABOUT

151
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:38,342
THAT BECAUSE IF YOU THINK

152
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:39,977
ABOUT IT, THE ONLY TIME WE

153
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:41,912
REALLY TALK ABOUT PEOPLE IN

154
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:43,247
THESE GLOWING TERMS IS AFTER

155
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:43,847
THEY PASS.

156
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:45,916
IF YOU ACTUALLY ALLOW

157
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,684
SOMEONE IN TO THE END OF

158
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:49,152
YOUR LIFE, SO THEY CAN

159
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:50,854
CELEBRATE YOU, AND LET YOU

160
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:51,888
KNOW WHAT HAVE YOU MEANT TO

161
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:53,090
THEM WHILE YOU ARE STILL

162
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,125
LIVING, THAT IS SO

163
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:55,892
INCREDIBLY PROFOUND AND IT

164
00:03:55,892 --> 00:03:58,161
IS SUCH AN AMAZING GIFT THAT

165
00:03:58,161 --> 00:04:00,030
VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE

166
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,498
OF GIVING SO MANY PEOPLE AND

167
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:02,899
HE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT.

168
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:06,203
HE HAD THE CONFIDENCE AND HE

169
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:07,771
HAD ENOUGH RESPECT FOR

170
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:08,905
HIMSELF, HIS AUDIENCE AND

171
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:10,807
HIS VERY CLOSE FRIENDS AND

172
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:12,142
COLLEAGUES HERE AT FOX.

173
00:04:12,142 --> 00:04:13,543
AND I THINK WE WILL BE

174
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:14,611
FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

175
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:16,279
NOT ONLY FOR SO MANY PEOPLE

176
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,113
HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO

177
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:18,949
REACH OUT TO HIM, BUT ALSO

178
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,584
AS AN EXAMPLE TO OTHER

179
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:21,985
PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN TAKE

180
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:25,589
THIS ON WITH A DEGREE OF POT

181
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,824
OF AND COMPORTMENT THAT WE

182
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:30,794
REALLY SEE AND I HOPE THAT

183
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:31,862
PEOPLE SEE THAT AS AN

184
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:33,797
EXAMPLE AND NOT ASHAMED TO

185
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:34,831
PASSING ONTO THE NEXT REALM.

186
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:36,033
AS PEOPLE OF FAITH AND THERE

187
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,434
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OF FAITH

188
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:39,503
HERE, WE EMBRACE THE AFTER

189
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:39,803
LIFE.

190
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:41,505
WE ARE TERRIFIED OF DYING.

191
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:43,373
SUCH BRAVERY AND STRENGTH

192
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:44,174
THAT CHARLES SHOWED GOING

193
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:45,876
INTO THAT.

194
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:46,710
>> Juan: I ALWAYS THOUGHT

195
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,078
AND THE REASON YOUR WORDS

196
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:49,646
TOUCHED ME IS I ALWAYS

197
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:50,480
THOUGHT THE IDEA OF SOMEONE

198
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,382
WHO WAS PARALYZED AND LIVING

199
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:54,084
IN A WHEELCHAIR, FOR HIM TO

200
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:55,686
DO JUST WHAT WE DO TO COME

201
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,688
AND BE COMMENTATORS ON

202
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:58,855
TELEVISION, TO WRITE A

203
00:04:58,855 --> 00:05:00,057
COLUMN, BOY, HE WAS TERRIFIC

204
00:05:00,057 --> 00:05:00,691
ABOUT IT.

205
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:06,263
HE NEVER WAS SELF-PITYING.

206
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:07,230
>> Greg: HE HAD TO FACE

207
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,965
SOMETHING EVERY DAY THAT WAS

208
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:11,268
BEYOND HIS OWN DISABILITY.

209
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:12,636
IT WAS PEOPLE THAT HE MET

210
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:14,171
THAT WEREN'T AWARE THAT HE

211
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:15,372
WAS DISABLED UNTIL THEY MET

212
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:15,639
HIM.

213
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:23,513
AND BECAUSE HE ALWAYS WHEN

214
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:26,016
HE WAS SHOT AT FOX YOU COULD

215
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:28,485
TELL HE WASN'T

216
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:28,518
TELL HE WAS IT

217
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:30,354
TELL HE WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR.

218
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:31,755
WHEN YOU MEET HIM MAYBE YOU

219
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:32,856
DIDN'T KNOW AND I REMEMBER

220
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:35,225
ONE OF MY -- ONE OF MY

221
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:36,593
BUDDIES MADE JOKE ABOUT

222
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:38,595
SHOULD CHARLES GO ON

223
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:39,429
"DANCING WITH THE STARS."

224
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:41,698
I SAID YOU WERE SUCH AN

225
00:05:41,698 --> 00:05:42,032
A-HOLE.

226
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:42,733
HE HAD NO IDEA.

227
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:45,135
IS HE A HUGE FAN.

228
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:46,570
IT WAS AFTER TUCKER WAS ON.

229
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,373
HE HAD NO IDEA THAT CHARLES

230
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:50,540
KRAUTHAMMER WAS IN A

231
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:50,941
WHEELCHAIR.

232
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:51,908
SEA VERY SERIOUS DUDE.

233
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:53,009
IS HE VERY FUNNY.

234
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:53,810
ONE THING THAT WAS

235
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,478
INTERESTING ABOUT HIM IS

236
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:56,480
THAT HE NEVER LET THIS --

237
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,048
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM IN

238
00:05:58,048 --> 00:05:59,316
HIS LIFE ACTUALLY AFFECT HIM

239
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:01,218
AND IN A WEIRD WAY IT TURNED

240
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:02,185
INTO AN ASSET FOR HIM

241
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:05,288
BECAUSE IT MADE HIM A MAN OF

242
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:08,291
IDEAS BECAUSE HE WAS

243
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,727
LIMITED -- HE WAS IN A CHAIR

244
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:12,763
FOR HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

245
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:14,765
AND HE MADE HIS ACHIEVEMENT

246
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:15,799
COME FROM HERE.

247
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,267
EVERYTHING WAS ABOUT IDEAS.

248
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,136
AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD

249
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:20,370
JUST MENTION IS WE DO LIVE

250
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,772
IN A TIME WHERE MORE PEOPLE

251
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:23,373
ARE HEALTHY AND LIVE LONGER

252
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:24,441
AND LESS DISEASE AND LESS

253
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:24,775
POVERTY.

254
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,309
WE HAVE AN INCREASE IN

255
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,676
SUICIDES.

256
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:28,178
WE SEE PEOPLE THAT ARE

257
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,913
DEALING WITH INNER DEMONS.

258
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:33,483
I THINK THAT'S WHY HE IS SO

259
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:38,989
INSPIRATIONAL BECAUSE HE HAS

260
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:40,290
EVERY EXCUSE TO HATE LIFE.

261
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,558
HE EMBRACED IT I DO NOT

262
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:43,994
THINK I COULD THAT MAN.

263
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:45,996
I HONESTLY DO NOT THINK I

264
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:49,933
COULD BE 10% OF CHARLES

265
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:50,400
KRAUTHAMMER.

266
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,034
>> Juan: THAT'S THE

267
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:52,135
DEFINITION OF COURAGE WHEN

268
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:53,336
PEOPLE STAND UP IN DIRE

269
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:53,937
CIRCUMSTANCES.

270
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:55,038
CANDACE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

271
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:56,139
CAN CAN EXACTLY EVERYTHING

272
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,208
THAT YOU SAID HERE, DESPITE

273
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,943
HIS DISABILITY HE WILL BE

274
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:02,846
REMEMBERED AS A MAN OF GREAT

275
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:03,313
FORTITUDE.

276
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:03,647
VIRTUE.

277
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:05,482
PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

278
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:06,349
POLITICAL AISLE COMING

279
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:07,717
FORWARD AND HONORING THIS

280
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:09,219
MAN SHOWS YOU HE WAS PATTERN

281
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:10,187
OF TREMENDOUS CHARACTER.

282
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:11,788
LOOK, HE WAS HAPPY WITH HIS

283
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:12,088
LIFE.

284
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:13,590
I THINK THAT THAT'S THE MOST

285
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,157
WONDERFUL THING.

286
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:15,759
THE WONDERFUL TAKE AWAY HERE

287
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,661
IS HOW HAPPY AND CONTENT HE

288
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:19,563
WAS WITH THE LIFE THAT HE

289
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:19,863
LIVED.

290
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:20,530
>> INTERESTING FOR ME

291
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,332
BECAUSE I KNEW HIM FOR SO

292
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:22,632
LONG.

293
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:24,668
I KNEW HIM BEFORE FOX EVEN.

294
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:26,269
I WILL SAY TWO THINGS ABOUT

295
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:26,636
CHARLES.

296
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:30,874
ONE IS THAT THE SENSE OF

297
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:32,142
SPIRIT AND HUMAN KINDNESS

298
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:33,710
THAT CAME FROM CHARLES

299
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,878
KRAUTHAMMER WAS NO PRETEND.

300
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:35,745
YOU INTRODUCE HIM TO PEOPLE

301
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:37,047
AT FOX.

302
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:37,747
OH, CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.

303
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:39,316
AND HE WOULD BE LIKE

304
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:40,484
CRACKING JOKES AND OPEN WITH

305
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:42,252
SO MANY FOLKS, JUST VERY

306
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:42,552
WARM.

307
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:44,020
BY THE WAY, JESSE, GOING TO

308
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,722
A BASEBALL GAME WITH CHARLES

309
00:07:45,722 --> 00:07:46,790
WAS, LITERALLY PEOPLE COMING

310
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,691
UP TO HIM.

311
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:49,059
BECAUSE HE GAVE STRUCTURE TO

312
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:49,759
SO MUCH CONSERVATIVE

313
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,093
THOUGHT.

314
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:51,628
A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES FELT

315
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:52,596
HEY, THIS IS THE GUY.

316
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:53,930
THIS IS THE INTELLECTUAL

317
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,999
THAT IS ABLE TO FRAME

318
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:58,702
CONSERVATIVE THOUGHT IN SUCH

319
00:07:58,702 --> 00:08:00,303
A WAY THAT THE LIBERALS AND

320
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:01,872
THE LEFT HAS TROUBLE WITH IT

321
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:03,673
THAT THEY FINALLY FEEL THAT

322
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:05,108
HERE IS AN INTELLECTUAL OF

323
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:05,742
THE RIGHT.

324
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:07,410
SOME PEOPLE CALL THEM NEO

325
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:07,844
CONSERVATIVES.

326
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:08,979
IT WAS CHARLES WHO TALKED

327
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:10,647
ABOUT THE REAGAN DOCTRINE IN

328
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:12,582
TERMS OF AMERICA GLOBALLY

329
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:13,850
STANDING UP FOR FREEDOM.

330
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,417
FOR SECURITY.

331
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:15,685
HE TALKED ABOUT A BUSH

332
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:16,720
DOCTRINE IN TERMS OF GOING

333
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,354
IN TO WAR.

334
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:18,955
HE GAVE THE FRAMEWORK.

335
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:20,056
AND GOING TO BASEBALL,

336
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:21,091
JESSE, WITH HIM, NOT ONLY

337
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:24,928
DID YOU SEE THE PEOPLE WERE

338
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:26,329
THANKING HIM FOR DOING THAT

339
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:27,297
YOU LEARN THAT THE LEARNERS

340
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:29,933
WHO OWN THE WASHINGTON

341
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,067
NATIONALS LOVE CHARLES.

342
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:33,135
HERE WE ARE YOU GO IN

343
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:34,871
CHARLES SPECIALLY MADE VAN

344
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:36,740
GOING DOWN SOUTH CAPITAL

345
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,941
STREET AND HERE WE ARE.

346
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:39,308
I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT

347
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:40,610
THAT PICTURE AGAIN, THAT'S

348
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,410
CHARLES ON THE BIG SCREEN

349
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,280
OVER THE STADIUM LAST NIGHT

350
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,949
AS THE NATS WERE PLAYING THE

351
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:46,783
ORIOLES AND THERE WAS A

352
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:47,984
MOMENT OF SILENCE.

353
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:48,885
IF YOU DROVE AND YOU THINK

354
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:50,453
OH MY GOD IS THIS GUY GOING

355
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:52,255
TO CRASH THIS VAN?

356
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:53,423
BUT YOU GET TO NATIONALS

357
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:54,624
PARK AND HE HAD THE BEST

358
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:56,259
PARKING LOT, JESSE BECAUSE

359
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,428
THE LEARNERS HAD A PARKING

360
00:08:58,428 --> 00:09:00,063
SPOT FOR HIM IN THE STADIUM.

361
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:02,866
I ALWAYS THOUGHT GEE, HOW'S

362
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:05,635
COME I CAN'T GET THIS.

363
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:06,403
>> Greg: JESSE WANTS TO GIVE

364
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:07,003
A VAN.

365
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:09,472
I KNOW A FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE

366
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:10,640
DRIVEN WITH CHARLES AND IT

367
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,109
WAS ONE OF THE MOST

368
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:13,877
FRIGHTENING.

369
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:14,978
>> CHARLES DRIVING?

370
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:15,779
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE

371
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,714
AWARE OF THAT SAY A VAN.

372
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:18,982
ASSUMPTION MAYBE SOMEBODY IS

373
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:19,316
DRIVING.

374
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:19,849
NO, NO.

375
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:24,321
HE IS DRIVING IT.

376
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:24,988
>> Juan: SPECIALLY EQUIPPED

377
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:25,288
VAN.

378
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:26,756
I USED TO JOKE THE MOST

379
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:27,857
EXPENSIVE CAR IN THE FOX

380
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:29,726
PARKING LOT DIDN'T BELONG TO

381
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:32,329
BRET OR BRIT HUME OR ANYBODY

382
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:33,330
IT BELONGED TO CHARLES

383
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:33,730
