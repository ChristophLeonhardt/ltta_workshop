you heard Rudy Giuliani's arguments does it get Trump off the hook as far as campaign finance violation no for several reasons the mere fact that the money may have been routed or funneled through intermediaries doesn't absolve all campaign finance law issues because the the critical issue is whether or not there was an in-kind contribution some kind of benefit so it doesn't get President Trump out of the woods on campaign finance law in addition it doesn't and I think I see what Rudy's trying to do Rudy's trying to say oh no well it came from the president so he didn't violate campaign finance law because a candidate is allowed to contribute as much as he wants to his campaign however number one there's potential reporting violations and number two everybody in that stream of Commerce there all these intermediaries all these funneling entities are potentially in violation of campaign finance law - then in addition to that you have potential tax issues if this was paid without getting the proper tax documentation and paying proper taxes on a payment it wasn't a gift we know that so it was a payment in return for something we have a contract that shows that so there are a number of different issues that come up when we haven't seen President Trump's taxes so what we don't have though but okay let's assume all of that is true I feel like we keep going in this circle campaign finance violation then why isn't anybody even charged with anything well that's a question for the US Attorney's the Southern District the special counsel if yet if I'm just taking a look at what the special counsel is up to for the most part they are waiting until their investigations completed and their investigation is completed when it's completed so they're not going to charge any of the big players if they're going to at all until they have all the the out the counts that they want to bring at once I think there may be an exception I mean with certain people like Flynn they may be holding off on certain counts until later so it's not to alert other defendants but typically the US Attorney's policy is to charge everything all at once so Rudy Giuliani now saying this is what lawyers do I do this for my clients you know fixing things he's now claiming this was to help President Trump save his marriage and he's also saying that it's not just a hundred and thirty thousand dollars this is carried a little bit but he's been invoking numbers like 460 and four hundred and seventy thousand to make things like this go away so he's immediately suggesting to an inquisitive investigator out there maybe what what are those things out there I think it's important to point out the timeline here Giuliani yesterday in all of his interviews said Trump only found out about this two weeks ago might have been ten days ago might have been five days ago okay so that's a little bit slippery but he's just paying hundreds of thousands of dollars out for no apparent reason Giuliani and Trump are over a barrel because as soon as they rated Michael Cohen's office Mulder knew this they knew this number it at minimum so what Giuliana is trying to do is surface this information and get it out there in the court of public opinion and try to say please Miller don't investigate this little bit it's a risky strategy because Giuliani himself like Trump is not very good at this he's not very good at talking out loud in such a way that doesn't invite more investigative follow-ups particularly because he invoked unthought appearance this morning the campaign in the election in the effect upon because he does these Fox News interviews as though he's sitting at Elios on the Upper East Side with four other guys over the age of 65 forgetting that the world is watching including robert muller at this k at this at this rate robert muller will not need to subpoena President Trump because they're given it all right they're on Fox News with Sean Hannity Devlin what was your biggest takeaway after after sitting down getting all of this information from Giuliani because at the very least it's confusing well sure it's confusing and and it works it's important on two levels one it contradicts statements that the president made to the public that's a big deal in any situation do we just know we're in contradicting the president but we need to remind our viewers the president's lawyer contradicting the president what does that mean it means the president lied to the American people or his lawyer is lying to the American people about the president so just digest that right and and while that is an important thing in some ways that's the best possible option here for Trump and his legal team you know Giuliani is clearly to Danny's point Giuliani is clearly trying to close the door on the issue of campaign finance but in attempting to close that door he opens like three or four other windows some of which include campaign finance law so you know his own statements contradict the argument at some at times that he's trying to make that's very problematic for for how this is going to go forward and the one of the things that really stands out to me is that in in Giuliani's conversation with us last night he said something along the lines of this was this was paid for Michael Michael Cohen was reimbursed for a bunch of stuff he did during the campaign and this was one of those things I mean honestly that just opens up a huge can of worms beyond what the can of worms they already have in front of them can I ask you what time were you guys on the phone with Rudy last night pretty late I mean it was after the Fox interview and you know before the Fox and Friends interview if that offends somewhere between 11 o'clock and midnight and and the president signed off I I turn to you on this Michael Rudy Giuliani said the president signed off on this know given how important this investigation is given rudy giuliani's history of I don't know stepping in it does it seem to make sense to you that the president would a okay not just going on TV with Sean Hannity but right around midnight you got Rudy letting it rip with the Washington Post yeah I don't know that this entire legal team represents the epitome of jurisprudence there's so many things first of all let's go back to why is it taking so long to file this or to charge on this an FEC of Federal Elections Commission violation takes a long time it's an understaffed agency I think it's weird that you have Rudy Giuliani executing a strategy that he clearly wanted to execute kind of pulling a pin in a hand grenade and just smugly sitting there saying see see what we got he didn't exculpate his client his client is now on the hook is everyone saying for camp a campaign finance violation of course it is and I've been trying to figure out why and the only explanation I could come up with is to some extent everything he said takes Michael Cohen off the hook a bit and he's trying to do all this even if he's trying to do all this because he's concerned that Michael Cohen has flipped on the president Julie exactly has been out and about in New York this week talking about helping the president in the case saying Michael Cohen is a good guy we want to help them they might not be talking to Michael day in a day out but they know Michael's watching to me the only logical explanation is we'll take a hit on a campaign finance violation which probably won't be enough to impeach the president were unbelievably scared of the other stuff that Cowan knows about say Russian dealings or former Soviet republics and this does take Cowan off the hook it's not him who made the illegal contribution and so maybe it's an effort to stop him from flipping you know this is a lot of sense in that maybe all of us are looking at the wrong shiny object because last night we're saying with all that he could cover why is he taking this turn into the stormy Daniels nonsense he didn't need to but maybe that's specifically why Rudy went on TV to make this point to Michael Cohen I think the biggest reveal last night is you got a look into the way rudy giuliani views this case he says they would never talk to Ivanka Trump because America wouldn't stand for it I don't necessarily know that that's true that's a that's a an accepted view of the case he all but challenged the Muller team he took a view of Comey that I don't think all of America would share it was very disparaging so I think Rudy Giuliani's view of this case is that people pay off people they settle cases it happens all the time I've done it he's done it everybody's done it but everybody hasn't done it and as somebody who has been on both sides but the plaintiffs and defense side in making demands to large corporations nuisance value is not one hundred and thirty thousand dollars it's not four hundred and thirty thousand dollars nuisance value to a big corporation is a thousand dollars ask any lawyer who has made a demand and a company who says we just wanted to go away president once you face some now you've done it hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
