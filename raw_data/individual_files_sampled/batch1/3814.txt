we're trying to compare whether we should pay off debt or whether we should invest money we look at the interest rate on that debt versus the return on our money and paying off a 25% interest rate is like getting a 25 percent return on your money but if you're paying off the student loan debt it's 6.8% or you've refinanced it and you're paying it off at 4% that's like getting a 4% return on your money and it's tax-deductible in a lot of cases which means it's even lower than that and that means that you're sort of balancing the either/or if you're trying to decide okay should I pay off this debt or should I place the money into my 401 K where I'm very likely going to earn 8 percent on average over time tax deferred and maybe get some matching dollars that can increase my return guaranteed through the roof you should put some money in your 401 K if you've got federal student loans those lenders can garnish your wages just like the IRS they can reach their hands into your bank account and they can take your money so you don't want to not pay your student loans it's a really really bad idea but you also don't want to put your life on hold to pay your student loans after you want to make sure that you try to aim for some sort of a balance there
