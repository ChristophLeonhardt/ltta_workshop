00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,939

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,529
grouchy and I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> completed</font>

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">philosophy essay so I'm therefore on a</font>

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,849
break and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd talk about</font>

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,260
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been really really</font>

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,049
greeting me really pissing me off and it

7
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">was in the news a couple of weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

8
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I didn't realize how much it would</font>

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,730
actually still be on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind and it came</font>

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,039
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday for some reason and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we came</font>

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of days ago and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was still</font>

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,730
angry about it and I am still angry

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,949
about it so seeing this is a platform

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,529
freedom<font color="#CCCCCC"> of speech or I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just Emily me</font>

15
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,230
expressing my anger I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd talk a</font>

16
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,610
little bit about this and to put this in

17
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,430
context this was a set by someone a

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,890
member of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> British national party on</font>

19
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,309
his blog and he was originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

20
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,559
run for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the luncheon assembly elections</font>

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,270
for which I think I one may the best and

22
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,360
when there was such like a fuller about

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,550
her they removed this guy from the

24
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,129
ballot for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the London</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Assembly elections</font>

25
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,190
and I never actually really apologized

26
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,460
but we said just said something like to

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,040
call being<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cover-up shit he like</font>

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,780
anyway so I'm going to read this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,600

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,580
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> understood why so many men have</font>

31
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,350
allowed themselves to be brainwashed by

32
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,880
the feminazis<font color="#E5E5E5"> mess machine into</font>

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,439
believing that Reapers such as serious

34
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,680

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,900
sex so rate cannot be such a terrible

36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,240
physical ordeal to suggest that rape

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,830
when conducted without violence is a

38
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,630
serious crime is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggesting that</font>

45
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,549

53
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:07,920
doesn't involve someone like holding a

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,300
knife to their throat and raving them

55
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,068

cordial or not emotionally at these

57
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,680

so much for parenting and he's always

99
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:44,459
put up this image they had two children

100
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:45,780

105
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,349
more of a joke and makes me even more
