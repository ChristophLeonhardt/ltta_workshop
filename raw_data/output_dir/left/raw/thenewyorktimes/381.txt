1
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,544
This is not C.G.I., 
it’s J.G.I.: 

2
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:15,315
Jellyfish Generated
Imagery.

3
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:20,120
In this case the bioluminescent 
atolla jellyfish.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,355
It’s a kind of amazing display

5
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,057
that comes from creatures 
in the sea

6
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,592
that make their own
light.

7
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,960
And there are a lot of them.

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,529
A recent study found that

9
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:33,066
among ocean dwellers that 
you can see with the naked eye,

10
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:33,800
although of course,

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,869
you'd have to be underwater 
for most of them,

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,638
three quarters are
bioluminescent.

13
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,907
Steven Haddock did the study.

14
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,575
“I always think of it like a
superpower. 

15
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,944
We think of these as, like, ‘oh, they're 
so primitive, these creatures'

16
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:45,712
but they can do something 
<i><u><font color=#00000000></font></u></i>

17
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,814
that we can only dream of doing, 
you know? 

18
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,149
Making light come out 
of your fingertips 

19
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,852
or throwing pixie dust
of glowing light  out at will."

20
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:52,886
or throwing pixie dust
of glowing light  out at will."
These creatures make light with
chemicals in their own bodies.

21
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,089
These creatures make light with
chemicals in their own bodies.

22
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,690
This is how they do it.

23
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,061
Luciferase, an enzyme,
prompts a chemical reaction

24
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,263
in which luciferin molecules
absorb energy

25
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:06,699
and then release
it as light.

26
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,968
Often they’re trying to scare
off predators.

27
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,605
They may even shoot out
bioluminescent material,

28
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:16,109
like this shrimp expelling a
blob of light.

29
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,212
Most of this world is hidden
from human beings.

30
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,648
There are yellow sea worms,

31
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,483
red ctenophores,

32
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,951
bristle worms,

33
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,087
small crustaceans

34
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:31,124
and lots and lots of
jellyfish.

35
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,992
When you see some of these
creatures,

36
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:37,430
it’s a reminder that the world 
is full of Cinderellas. 

37
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,765
Sea cucumbers.

38
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,166
They’re pretty ugly. 

39
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,602
Just lumps to most humans. 

40
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,637
But when they light up at night, 

41
00:01:44,637 --> 00:00:00,000
the party is on.
