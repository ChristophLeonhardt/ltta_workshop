1
00:00:00,144 --> 00:00:00,978
KEVIN, WHAT DOES IT LOOK

2
00:00:00,978 --> 00:00:01,578
LIKE IN THERE.

3
00:00:01,578 --> 00:00:02,780
>> NEIL, VERY INTERESTING.

4
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,281
I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT

5
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:05,415
BECAUSE YOU KNOW COMING INTO

6
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:07,117
THE SUMMIT, SOME NEWSPAPERS,

7
00:00:07,117 --> 00:00:08,252
INCLUDING THE "TIMES,"

8
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:09,353
DESCRIBED THE PRESIDENT AS A

9
00:00:09,353 --> 00:00:10,521
BIT OF A BLACK SHEEP OF THE

10
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:12,456
FAMILY BECAUSE OF HIS SORT

11
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:13,957
OF CANTANKEROUS NATURE

12
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:14,658
BEFORE COMING HERE.

13
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:16,226
AND SO A LOT OF US ARE

14
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:17,127
WONDERING WHAT MIGHT THAT

15
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:18,328
FAMILY PHOTO LOOK LIKE?

16
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:19,396
WELL, LET ME SHOW YOU.

17
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:20,697
OKAY, I WILL JUST SAY IT

18
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:21,064
THIS WAY.

19
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,399
IT LOOKED FINE ON THE

20
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:22,833
SURFACE, NEIL.

21
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,234
A LOT OF SMILES THAT YOU

22
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:25,636
WOULD WELL-IMAGINE YOU WOULD

23
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:27,037
SEE IN THAT SORT OF A PHOTO.

24
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:28,672
IT STILL MAKES YOU WONDER

25
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,474
BENEATH THE SURFACE, WAS

26
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:31,375
THERE TENSION THERE?

27
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,308
OBVIOUSLY NOT A LOT TO DRAW

28
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:33,410
FROM THE PICTURE ITSELF.

29
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,212
DID I NOTICE THAT CANADIAN

30
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:36,580
PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN

31
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,248
TRUDEAU APPEARED TO LEAVE A

32
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:40,350
LITTLE QUICKLY WHY WHILE THE

33
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,486
PRESIDENT AND ANGELA MERKEL

34
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:43,253
PULLED UP THE REAR.

35
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:44,922
THE PRESIDENT DID SPEAK OF

36
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:45,856
MACRON MEET WITH THE FRENCH

37
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:46,690
PRESIDENT BRIEFLY.

38
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,325
HE HAS BEEN HIGHLY CRITICAL

39
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:49,259
OF PRESIDENT BUSH TO LEVEL

40
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,461
THE PLAYING FIELD ON TRADE.

41
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:53,797
NOW BEFORE LEAVING

42
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:55,098
WASHINGTON FOR QUEBEC, THE

43
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:55,933
PRESIDENT MADE THIS VERY

44
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:56,233
CLEAR.

45
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,835
HE HAS ONE WORD IN MIND WHEN

46
00:00:57,835 --> 00:01:00,804
IT COMES TO TRADE AND THAT'S

47
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:02,206
RECIPROCITY.

48
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:04,208
>> IF WE'RE UNABLE TO MAKE A

49
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,909
DEAL, WE WILL TERMINATE

50
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:06,743
NAFTA, WE HAVE A BETTER

51
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:07,144
DEAL.

52
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:09,279
IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A

53
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:11,682
DEAL, WE WILL BE BETTER OFF.

54
00:01:11,682 --> 00:01:13,584
RIGHT NOW, WE ARE NOT GOING

55
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,185
TO LIVE WITH THE DEALS THE

56
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:16,687
WAY THEY ARE.

57
00:01:16,687 --> 00:01:17,855
EUROPEAN UNION TREATS US

58
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:19,089
VERY UNFAIRLY.

59
00:01:19,089 --> 00:01:20,991
CANADA VERY UNFAIRLY.

60
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:22,492
MEXICO VERY UNFAIRLY.

61
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:24,294
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I

62
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:25,462
THINK WE WILL PROBABLY VERY

63
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:27,731
EASILY MAKE A DEAL.

64
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:29,566
>> VERY EASILY MAKE A DEAL.

65
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:30,601
WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT

66
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:31,969
THE DEAL MIGHT LOOK LIKE.

67
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,470
BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A

68
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,605
SENSE, NEIL, OF WHAT THE

69
00:01:34,605 --> 00:01:35,906
PRESIDENT CALLS UNFAIR

70
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:37,407
TRADE, LOOK AT WHAT HE

71
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:38,008
TWEETED.

72
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:40,477
CANADA CHARGES THE U.S. A

73
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:41,912
270% TARIFF ON DAIRY

74
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:42,346
PRODUCTS.

75
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:44,281
THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT,

76
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:44,882
DID THEY?

77
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:49,253
NOT FAIR TO OUR FARMERS.

78
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:49,887
THE COMING UP WITH TRUDY

79
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:50,454
LATER ON.

80
00:01:50,454 --> 00:01:51,388
GIVE YOU A READOUT AS SOON

81
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:52,356
AS WE GET IT.

82
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:53,223
IN THE MEANTIME THE

83
00:01:53,223 --> 00:01:54,191
PRESIDENT IS HERE AND IS

84
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:55,792
EXPECTED TO LEAVE A LITTLE

85
00:01:55,792 --> 00:00:00,000
BIT SOONER THAN ORIGINALLY
