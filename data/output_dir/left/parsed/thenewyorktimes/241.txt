“I could do this all day.
Like, give me a Sharpie
and, like, it’s on.
Oh, nice.”
“I like signing my name.
I don’t know, I feel 
like the J is sexy
because you could do 
so many things with it,
and so many curves to it,
which I think fits me.
It’s funny because I feel like
we don’t sign at all anymore.”
“I used to love to sign my name.
Be all over a notebook at the 
end of like a school year.”
“That was in middle
school, when I was
very excited about trying to
figure out how to do a signature.
Then in high school,
I created another signature.
You know, 16 years old,
got my driver’s license.”
“So when I was, I guess
in grade school,
I remember trying to make a
signature that I thought looked
kind of like graffiti or a tag.
Even though I had never, 
you know, spray-painted
or done anything like that.
I write my S's backwards.
I’ve made like an @ sign, 
which is like a D and an A,
and I make an M,
and then I’ve got 
an arrow at the end
that just kind of symbolizes
that my life is on the upwards.”
“And when I started
actually signing
like it was really me
mimicking my mom’s signature.
And I still kind of
kept this little curve
in the signature — that’s
definitely from my mother.”
“In Russian it’s called ‘roscherk,’
which is like kind of
ending the signature with
some sort of, like, ornament.
Or maybe it’s just 
a character of me
taking a little more space 
than I require, I don’t know.
But my wife always rolls her eyes.”
“I was always told that
it was too involved.
But I maintain that it’s a
necessary part of my style.”
“So this one is called
‘I’m in a rush to get out 
of this restaurant.’
The few times a year that
I'm actually writing checks,
then I actually do 
a connected signature.”
”You know really you only 
need to have a signature
for legally binding 
contracts at this point.
And then I’m sure at 
one point that won’t even be it.
Because you know we can sign
things electronically now. So ...”
“I would miss it.
There’s nothing more fabulous
than having a conversation:
‘Oh, yes, thank you.’
That is just so fun.
Like who doesn’t —
Who doesn’t like it? Especially
if it’s a really good place.”
