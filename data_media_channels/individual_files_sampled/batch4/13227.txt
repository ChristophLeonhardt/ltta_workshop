microphones cost money and you need to stay on so I'm watching oh yeah before I start talking about anything else I want to just mention the fact that Tom Wolfe died terrific authors 87 years old good long life with many beautiful beautiful books and I'll try and talk about him later in the week it just happened while I was preparing the show so I didn't want to go off half-cocked and talk about but he was a terrific writer a wise guy and and really really an interesting addition to the American literary canon I'm sorry to see him go at 87 is a good long life but I'm sorry to see him go you know I've been watching this thing with the American Embassy moving to Jerusalem I guess we're all watching it on TV and it reminded me of something about failure failure is a habit it's a habit of mine I have seen this all throughout my life I've seen it with dozens of people sometimes it's even popped up in my own life if failure is something you get used to and you keep doing the same thing you know the old expression that insanity is when you keep doing the same thing but you expect different results hire a friend a little off the topic but actually a good story I had a friend a long long time ago and we would go out together and sometimes read double-date you know sometimes and he dated a different woman all the time who was always the same woman she was always a she always looked the same show I said short cut blonde hair she was a small frame but very beautiful and she was always out of her mind I never seriously never went out with this guy when his girlfriend did not end up curled up on the floor screaming and crying about something and it was always a different woman it was always at they were so similar they even looked so similar that one night we went out together and was halfway through the evening before I realized he a girlfriends again because there was and one night he and I sat up in one of those kind of guys drinking all my you know things and we were talking about life and everything and he said I can't understand it I cannot understand it I my relationships keep falling apart and I was like you know you keep going out with the same woman what are you talking about I've gone out with all these didn't know I said yeah but they're all that they even look exactly like and he couldn't hear me it reminded me yeah you ever see Rob that thing about the nail is is not about the net oh let's play with just a little bit of it this is a girl sitting on the sofa explaining to her boyfriend that she's got this terrible headache and if he can't see if you're just listening when she turns around we see there's a gigantic nail sticking out of her forehead it's just there's all this pressure you know and sometimes it feels like it's right up on me and I can just feel it like literally feel it in my head and it's relentless and I don't know if it's gonna stop I mean that's the thing that scares me the most is that I don't know if it's ever gonna stop yeah you do have a nail in your head it is not about the nail are you sure because I mean I'll bet if we got that out of there stop trying to fix it no I'm not trying to fix it I'm just pointing out that maybe the nail is cause you always do this you always try to fix things when what I really need is for you to just listen see I don't think that is what you need I think what you need is to get the nail okay fine I will listen fine because that is the habit of failure that is the habit of suffering and you know it in the in the Bible st. Paul says I do not understand what I do for I want to do for what I want to do I do not do but what I hate I do I think it even goes beyond that - I mean that is of course the state of sin but it also goes beyond that - what the philosopher Schopenhauer said he said a man can do what he wants but he can't will what he wants I think we even want the things that destroy us and when we what we have to exact we have to under the underlying principles that were operating on the broken principles that are causing us to become comfortable with this habit of failure so you want to see a habit of failure you want to see a country that got into a habit of failure take a look at this montage of the presidents and see if you can spot which president is different from the others is cut number 3 Jerusalem is still the capital of Israel and must remain an undivided City accessible at all as soon as I take office I will begin the process of moving the United States ambassador to the city Israel as children as Catholics I continue to say that Jerusalem will be the capital of Israel and I have said that before and I will say it again Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel and it must remain undivided we will move the American Embassy to the Eternals capital of the Jewish people Jerusalem can you spot the difference between those presidents like you know 20 I think it's 23 years ago there was a bipartisan law passed in Congress that said Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and we will move our embassy to Jerusalem because it is the capital of Israel where we put our embassies right 23 years ago in this law there is a waiver that every six months if you say well maybe this is not the right time you can sign that way for 23 years presidents have been signing that waiver and obviously not doing it's not like they've been scratching their chin and walking around the Rose Garden and thinking hmm do I say you know that thing it's the waiver time again yeah that's day you know and it's just that habit of failure they ha they if we believe in it if it's a bipartisan law why it we doing it for 23 years I can understand six months I could understand a year putting it off but for 23 years you get into a habit of failure and that habit of failure underneath that habit of failure is a system of thought is a system of values and principles that are powering that that you can't let go of even as they're causing you to sink beneath the waves and we do this in all kinds of things we do it in our personal lives we do it on professional lives and we've been doing it in our national lives with Jerusalem I'm gonna talk about well I've got to show you show you what that underlying principle is or at least some of those underlying principles that have caused us to fail on this again and again every president promising it and every president letting it go by the board but first we're going to talk about candid Co this is now you know I try and use everything that they give us I try every time we have a sponsor I try and test it out but candid Co is a system for getting accessible and affordable orthodontic care online it's for straightening out your teeth and I at this point

modeling kit candid co.com slash Clavin and you'll be able to look like knowles or like me with noses teeth which is even better alright so what is the underlying principle that fuels this this habit of failure to support israel i will show it to you in what was an amazing amazing press conference with raja the assistant I guess spokesman for the White House and here are the questions that the reporters were asking him about now to set this up obviously you probably already know this that I'm in Gaza has basically told people to try and invade Israel and as apparently they told the people that the wall between Gaza and Israel was not manned which it is it's manned with soldiers who protect it and so they raced at the wall setting tires on fire throwing gas things you know over this throwing flaming kites and all this and and the Israelis opened fire on some of them as they were charging the wall it was an invasion it was thousands of people charging the wall so they opened fire and more people have been killed more Palestinians have been killed than since the 2014 war so here is the press reacting to this in their the way they've been reacting for 70 years right Israel is now 70 years old and this is the way the press has been reacting forever asking these questions of Raja well we believe that you know Hamas is responsible for these for these tragic deaths that their rather cynical exploitation of the situation it is what is what's leading to these deaths and we want them stopped so there's no burden on Israel to do something that sort of rein it in but I can't very quickly the French Foreign Minister Raj said about what's taking place in Gaza he urged Israeli authorities to exercise discretion and restraint so to be clear does the u.s. not agree with the French the Israeli authorities should exercise discretion and just restraint we believe that Hamas is responsible for what's going on so there's no responsibility on that on the Israeli authorities kill at will what I'm saying is that we believe that Hamas as an organization is engaged in cynical action that's leading to these deaths he's between the last time the White House reached out to Palestinian leadership and will given the high numbers of casualties Palestine is calling what's happened today a massacre will the White House be reaching out well I don't honestly have an answer for you on that I'll get back to you just follow-up that short I Jared Kushner and his speech pointed a finger at the Palestinians saying they were responsible provoking violence but given the fact that it's only Palestinians are being killed should Israel not shoulders my blanket well as I said earlier we believe Hamas bears the responsibility but this is a propaganda attempt I mean this is a gruesome and unfortunate propaganda attempt I think the Israeli government has spent weeks trying to handle this without violence how many times does he have to say the right the same thing over and over again it's Hamas who is responsible for this Hamas is a terrorist organization in its charter it calls for the destruction of Israel when Hamas as leader was asked does he believe that Israel has a right to exist he said I'll have to have a country first and then I'll get back to you thanks a lot that's like you know do you believe that I have a right to exist allow me I need a gun first and then I'll let you know that The Daily News just to cover itself in slime and when you have underlying principles that are wrong when you underlying principles that are misguided one of the ways you can tell is what be you be turned into that's one of the ways you can tell if you can't argue with someone who opposes you without using four-letter words if you can't argue without attacking somebody personally you've probably made a mistake somewhere here's the daily news if vodka Trump was sent over to the opening of the embassy made speeches welcoming person people it was a celebratory event in in Israel because obviously finally they're getting something that is just has just been reality or America is just recognizing reality The Daily News puts out this headline of Ivanka smiling daddy's little ghoul this 5055 slaughtered in Gaza but Ivanka all smiles at Jerusalem embassy unveil when you turn into that when you turn into a person who does that to someone you know that you've made a mistake that's when you start to say like oh yeah now I stink I suck and it's probably good because my values are bad Joe re-echoed this just like kind of slavish ly sold this line of thought listen to them talking about this and Iike it for the rest of the world you actually saw an administration a White House and we'll say it since Ivanka Trump was there a family completely out of touch with the realities of the region that they're dealing with and you know it you you had fifty five fifty five people killed yesterday 15:58 and you had a split screen of what looked like a VIP tent at the Belmont Stakes and and they just they don't seem totally oblivious to what was going on nothing not so far away totally oblivious they're celebrating that they're celebrating the opening of the embassy in Jerusalem while these terrorists who want to wipe this country off the face of the earth are trying to kill them you know nikki Haley push this a little further saying it's not just Hamas that Hamas is Iran and that of course is true the Iran deal part of what's going on is Iran is fighting back against a Washington that is finally admitting admitting that Iran is not our friend Iran is responsible for a lot of this and nikki Haley in the UN when they were gathering together to obviously to condemn Israel went after them in recent days Hamas terrorists backed by Iran have incited attacks against Israeli security forces and infrastructure that is violence that should occupy our attention to the common thread and all of this is the destabilization cysts on promoting violence throughout the Middle East while depriving its own people of basic human rights the United States welcomes a discussion of this violence in the Middle East we welcome discussing the ways we can cooperate with each other to put an end to this violence there is far too little discussion the Security Council on Iran's destabilizing presence in Syria its promotion of violence in Yemen its support for terrorism in Gaza and it's dangerous and illegal weapons buildup in Lebanon so you know this is what's what's happening here Walter Russell Mead great new columnist in the Wall Street Journal wrote about this today what is happening is Obama was basically withdrawing from the Middle East and he thought if were nice to Iran Iran will become more moderate and they'll be nice and we can just kind of pull out and then we'll have the great global world is coming the great you know unified global world run by the UN and America won't have to be the cop anymore on the street so it's just we'll just kind of decline into like a sort of England we used to be a great power but we're not anymore and Donald Trump is like I don't think so I don't think that's where this is going obviously Iran is not moderating is not becoming a more moderate force whether they're building nuclear weapons or not they're not becoming a moderate force they're still terrorists trying to destroy Israel if we pull out israel is going to be in big trouble and freedom is going to be in big trouble because that is the underlying principle that that these reporters are all missing the idea is that we are supposed to be fair and treat palestine that the Palestinians and the Israelis are the same and we should not we should not they are not the same you know who knew this Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer you know he never acts on it he never did anything about it he brags about how he helped pass the bill declaring Jerusalem the capital but he never did anything he supported Obama he didn't support the Iran deal but he supported Obama when Obama was stabbing Israel in the back repeatedly but he made his speech in 2014 he said you can't have moral equivalence between these two people this was right after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed by Hamas and somebody struck back by killing a Palestinian teenager and he said this is not the same thing listen to to chuck when he was actually talking sense he wasn't doing anything about it but he was talking sense how can we compare the two sides how can people say oh the Israelis oh the palestinians it's one big fight they're all the same it is not again regretfully there are fanatics on both sides and I abhor the Israeli fanatics they make things bad for the vast majority of Israelis who want to live in peace in a two-state solution but the vast majority of Israelis condemn the Jewish fanatics the vast majority of Palestinians seem to praise the Palestinian terrorists and Hamas one of the two main governing organizations in Gaza and the West Bank loudly praises the kidnapping and killing of the three Israeli boys right it's about values it's about what Israel stands for Israel stands for freedom I'd you know one of the most successful videos I ever did in my early when I first started doing videos was called the one state solution where the entire Middle East is given to Israel said never mind this two-state solution and of course I was I was joking about that but I wasn't joking about the fact that the values of Israel that actually supports freedom of religion supports freedom for women supports equality democratic governance rule of law all those things that Israel supports that the Palestinians do not support and they Iranian do not support by the way there are plenty of countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and Jordan that are saying like yeah we don't really care about this you know Israel is actually better for us than Iran they're actually siding with Israel now because Iran is becoming such a beast because Obama was pulling out and letting Iran get bigger and bigger and bigger those underlying principles are false Israel is our is not just our friend because they're our friend they're our friend because they are us they are the West they are freedom they're rule of law they're the things that we support in this world and we don't support the Palestinians in the same way because they are not representing those values the last thing we need is another crummy country of oppression you know when when Saudi Arabia moves a little bit toward being more like Israel more like the West when these countries do that they become better countries for their people for their people too so we're supporting values over there it's not just it is not that all these people are the same and it's not just the body-count either because the body-count it really does matter who is responsible for it you know if you want to know about stuff if you want to really learn get deep information about stuff you got to read magazines you got to read books and you got to read magazines and you don't have to read like you don't have to go out into the newsstand there's a

to end with just one thing you know IIIi did it yesterday they released an interview I did on a podcast called bad Christian podcast and on this interview I was talking about relations with blacks and they were kind of they're young guys and they're saying well you know shouldn't don't you have white privilege and shouldn't we balance white privilege and I said you know what you can't change the past the past is the past you can only stop doing what you were doing that's all you can do you can only start treating people equally equally what do I do with an equal person I compete with them I try to make him beat if he wants the job I want he's got to be better than me that's it that way he has to be excellent and somebody put on Twitter and I'm not attacking this guy personally I know he's a man of goodwill he just wants things to be good but he says this was cruel it is cruel to expect a black man to compete with you it's like asking a twig to compete with a tank so I'm cruel because I'm treating a black guy as my equal which I believe I mean that's not I'm not just treating that way I actually believe he is my equal but he is kind like the guy like the guy in 300 I am kind you know he is kind because he is treat is pitying this guy and infantilizing this guy and belittling this guy in the interests of his feeling that he is serving equality you want to serve equality you treat people like equals and if I treat you like an equal it means I'm gonna make you beat me for everything that I want if you want to take something for me you got to be better than me and ultimately of course you'll never beat me I mean let's let's face it but ultimately that is going to raise you to excellence and after I'm dead you can sort of you want these underlying principles make us foolish and we don't look around and say oh look they're failing they're failing there is no Israel Palestinian peace process there hasn't been for 70 years you can't have a peace process with people who want to destroy you there is no there's no good for black people in treating them like children and treating them like second-rate citizens that is not a good thing that is not helpful say oh you need reparations before you can do anything no you don't get an education make sure you marry the women who have your children do those things and you will be everything that you are going to be and that when you start to treat people like that you break the habit of failure because you're getting rid of the underlying values that are leading you astray hey today this very day May 15th at

feminists think women suck and Men Rock I have been saying that for a long time and Natalie Richie says it even better come on over to the daily wire.com you have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube all right Natalie Ritchie joined us from Sydney Australia where it was 4 o'clock in the morning which was very kind of her she's the author of roar like a woman how feminists think women suck and Men rock which will be released June 5th but you can already pre-order it on Amazon she explains the difference between feminism and masculinism and how the feminist movement has degraded into the latter she's a former travel writer and media relations consultant in the tourist industry and her most recent role was his features editor for Australia's national parenting magazine child she's also the mother of two boys he or she is Natalie Ritchie from Sydney Australia Natalie thank you for waking up so early to be here I know it's some ungodly hour and where you are but I appreciate it Oh anything for you Andrew 15 a.m. is fine so you know I've been I've been reading roar like a woman how feminists think women suck and Men Rock and I have to tell you that a lot of this stuff that has occurred to me before that feminists seemed to have adopted male values let me just I will read a quote for the audience and then ask for your comment on it feminism cares about career not because it sees career as women's work but because it sees it as men's work and therefore as the pathway to self-actualization for women can you explain that why why do you feel that it yeah I think when feminism began in the 1960s and the seventies it was such a positive movement you know it was about getting women out of those limiting roles of early being a housewife and mother and going out into the world and doing lots of great stuff that was such a wonderful thing and it achieved that in a couple of short decades you know from 1963 to 1983 say it basically changed the world that was wonderful but then it morphed into the very opposite of what it that out to be it instead of attacking the oppression if you like that kept women limited to housewives and mothers it attacked housewives and mothers themselves and so instead of being a left-wing movement that purported to care about women as a minority it flung itself at the feet of you know the big bad white men on the right kind of thing and said no hero here's the way the truth and the light you know you've got to be him or you're not as good as him and so it's actually morphed into a very misogynist patriarchal movement it has become a patriarchy all its own it really is true in for a left-wing movement it has also adopted the values of capitalism it basically says to women if you're not making money if you're not you know making the same amount of money as somebody else you're not so you're kind of a failure that's right you know men have been taken as the benchmark and women are no longer legitimate people in their own right and when you worship men like that you worship the the dimensions of life that men live in and you know men are primarily spend their day in in the you know the public dimension of life its business its government its politics law academia and so feminism has pumped all the oxygen to those dimensions and drained oxygen drains validation from the big private dimension if you like the place outside the workplace you know the home the community the family you know the the the connections between people and and I wonder if that is why or if that is contributing to the ends ie that we all feel today because if you're living to work if you're living to govern you're not living well you know business and government are there to serve the business of living you know we work to live we govern to live and and so feminism has really inverted the purpose of of why we're all here you know yeah well I certainly agree with you that when feminism got started in the 60s and 70s there was a lot of there were changes that needed to be made with our gender roles and become become very restrictive and there were all kinds of reasons technology and birth control while women were now free of certain things that they weren't free of before but very early on there was a kind of tendency toward this in the movement Simone de Beauvoir famously said that she didn't believe that women should be allowed to make the choice of being homemakers because too many women would make that choice which translates into women shouldn't live the way they want to live they should way live the way Simone de Beauvoir wants them to live why do you think why do you think that that strain of feminism has has taken over I think my personal theory is that those masculinist women I would call them a masculinist women have probably grown up in homes where they didn't have strong wine was from what I would call strong women you know women who actually valued what women bring to the world the mothering most obviously running a home which matters you know dinner matters a clean house matters the kids matter your neighbors matter that your connections with the community matter she's a mother a woman is probably caring for you know her own elderly parents these things all matter to and the only difference I would say between a failed woman at a successful woman is self-respect you know you don't even you don't have to like being a housewife if you don't even have to enjoy being a mother lots of mothers don't enjoy everything about motherhood but you but you do need to respect it you know what you what you're doing that is and feminism is saying what women bring to the world doesn't matter only what he brings matters and that is causing women to you know attack ourselves we're actually leaving that we suck but if we do what a man does if we have that CV then we don't suck anymore and and it's got to be the same CV he's got we've got to be doing the same jobs working the same hours and what that means is that if every woman is doing what a man does then no woman is doing what women do and if every if a man is a petroleum engineer then she's got to be a petroleum engineer and she can't you know run a ballet studio or run a manicure salon unless he runs the ballet studio or owes a manicure so then we get to this insane world where women are eradicated and the stock of metal energy in the world is effectively doubled it is really is strange especially because it depends upon women hiring other women to do the things that women have traditionally loved to do like nurture children I mean it's not like the children can run free somebody's got to come in and take care of them and usually that means that upper-class women are hiring lower class women so it doesn't actually change anything a dress it just supports the rich over the poor yes yes and you know if you can't afford to buy that help in then you wear it all yourself you know the average woman takes on both these say 40-hour week that a man is working which we consider a full-time contribution from a man she's also doing the immensity of motherhood you know I turn it up the hours that I've worked with if you have an ever crying baby as I did with my first child if you have a toddler if you're running a home and that can all add up I get a copy I calculated it came to over 300 hours a week I mean obviously she's not doing 300 hours a week but if she was cleaning the bathroom if she was doing all the different chores that are there to be done bets how much work it is and then feminism comes along and slams a 40-hour week down on her head as well and says you've got to do that before you're his equal he doesn't have to do what she does before feminism considers him to be her equal you know feminism isn't saying all men are in a distressing state of inferiority because they're not mothering and so this we have this incredibly I'm an equal situation now where women are left with their 50% share of the domestic and parody mode they're doing most of his 50% share of the domestic and parenting mode and they're doing as much as 100% of his page 40-hour week and this is untenable if you're wealthy yes you can afford the working-class women to come into your home I just spoke to a woman recently who had a what she called a household manager which is like a it's a housekeeper so in addition to a cleaner she had someone come in four hours a day at that fool hour time about 2:00 to 6:00 p.m. she cooked dinner she take tinder to the kids she got the homework done and that's fantastic but she would watch what that woman was doing was acknowledging how much work she does and was actually willing to pay for it but most of us could not afford to do that and so we've been are just absorbing and absorbing and absorbing more and more and the pressure is not letting up from feminism I thought it would actually pull back after that first intense masculinists era of the 80s and 90s but in fact called for gender equality where 100% of women do what 100% of men do our ramping up you know feminism is interpreting the Equality is a 50/50 breakdown of any given endeavor well 50/50 is just another way of saying 100 100 it's about saying 100% of women they've got to do what 100 percent of men do you know there's a there's a tendency among feminists certainly among the feminists who are most outspoken now to attribute certain attitudes to men that are only true of the worst sorts of men so they they talk about men as being pigs to women they talk about men is not having respect for what women do but of course you know most men we just had Mother's Day here yesterday I mean most men the last words they ever speak on earth the calling for their mothers they you know they they think about their mothers with very high regard I've been around men all my life and when they speak of their wives oddly enough I mean you know you if you only went by what you saw on television you would think the men were constantly making snarky remarks about their wives but in locker rooms and places where men gather men speak with about their wives with enormous respect it makes me wonder is feminism being led by a group of women who are projecting those attitudes that those are their attitudes that they hate themselves as mothers they hate themselves as wives and they're projecting that attitude on men I think so totally I think I have never yet met a an avowed feminist who speaks well of her own mother and also speaks well of her own father she might worship her father but what I've noticed is that feminists always seem to see men as powerful but powerful in negative ways you know they're powerful through being absent as a deserting father or through arrogance or through alcoholism or abuse and they stand to see their mothers as powerless as damaged or crippled and then I think yes they are projecting those those ugly family dynamics onto society at large they're probably only a minority of women but we all tend to go along with feminism because it stands up for women's rights to a career and we don't want to be seen to renounce our right to career we think feminism is our friend so we get we get pulled in along pulled along in the wake of those masks giving us women who really do not have respect for themselves or respect for men your men are not toxic masculinity is not toxic masculinity is wonderful you know masculinity gave us just about everything worth having it gave us freedom political systems you know the economy inventions science it's it's just about everything use its a very strange and one of the things that you wrote about there really I was so happy to see you write about was a single motherhood I mean I've visited a lot of prisons and I've seen when you walk by the cells what you are seeing is one fatherless child after another how do you feel that feminism has increased single motherhood and and why do you feel that that is it so bad yes I think it's bad because I have been a single mother my marriage ended when my two sons were four and five and it brings me frankly I do not get by you know I have an education I can get a job but how do I get a job when I already have the world's busiest job taking care of children and Judah the jobs in my field are in a location in my city that is a very long distance from my house I cannot make that commute in one hour even if I were to find a job at 5:00 p.m. which in my city I live in Sydney Australia jobs finish it like 6:00 6:30 p.m. and then you've got to make a very long commute to the daycare center which closes at 6:00 p.m. they all shut at 6:00 p.m. here and then you've got to get home it takes me 40 minutes to get home to be getting into into the home at 6:40 p.m. and starting to get dinner cooked to get the kids inside you know the the whining you know what it like the only the dishes that haven't been cleared since the morning you know all of that stuff it is impossible and and any feminism is acting as if that immense job of motherhood does not exist and that a woman can do both his work if you call it his work of earning a living and her work of motherhood at the very same time yeah so it's become individualist movement that's acting as if families don't exist and people don't need each other but people do need each other know you know I I'm running out of time I want to ask you a last question you talk about a woman shaped world what does a woman shaped world look like exactly oh yeah I think a woman shaped world it would just be a world that gives a woman heard you equally as much as we give a man his due but particularly in the workplace just accommodate the work that women are already doing running homes and taking care of the kids and actually shapes jobs to fit that reality you know we design a job to start it's a 9:00 a.m. finish around 5:00 p.m. should give a man time to eat breakfast travel to work come home eat dinner have an evening we give him two whole days out of seven in which to rest give him annual vacation but we're not doing that for so we're acknowledging his humanity were not really acknowledging her human experience which is the experience of running homes and caring for kids you know we could have a parallel school ours economy that I think more than anything else in the workplace would make an enormous difference to your mothers to women's lives it would it would be a very empowering thing employers have businesses to run of course they do but employers had mothers too you know mothers are everybody everybody only had a mother and we should be able to be accommodating that immense work workload you know it's funny I I believe that more than anything that feminists say and male oppression or anything that the biggest problem women have today is that industry has taken a lot of what used to be home industries out into the factory and left out home others without a way to make a living a while being an at-home mother which they used to have and that is a problem that really needs solving Thank You Natalie Richie author of roar like a woman how feminists think women suck and men rock thank you for getting up so early in Sydney Australia I appreciate it it's really nice to have you thanks a lot really interesting lady and nice intro to sexual follies so HuffPo it's gotta be one of the stupidest I Andrew Breitbart told me he helped build the Huffington Post he said it was one of the biggest mistakes of his life he did he said as a terrible mistake they had an article why is fish sex so hot right now an investigation right this is by claire fallon and basically she finds that there are two stories the shape of water obviously the oscar-winning film by gillian mill del toro and a book called pisces that feature women having sex with fish and so she takes us to be a trend and she says these stories seem to have arrived during an inflection point for heterosexual relations as some straight women have thrown their hands up in despair at the prospect of dealing with straight men these men who grope us and talk down to us and consistently fail to clean the bathroom we're supposed to make lives with them let them touch us women woke up one day to find that their husbands voted for Donald Trump and their sons have been posting on in cell boards even before we heard the claims about Harvey Weinstein's history of sexual harassment and assault and the assuming avalanche of other horrifying me to allegations we heard about our president grabbing women Bill Cosby so many straight men we have been forced to accept our bad too and for us why would we take the enormous risk of loving then would loving one of them and what yet we do have survivors so let's sleep with fish basically first of all you know my daughter faith more rights over PJ media she did a hilarious piece on this it's called Huff Huff Post women would rather have sex with fish than a man and she makes fun of this the fact that it's just two stories doesn't make it a trend but one of the things she says if faith says is that in in stories where women sleep with beasts like Beauty and the Beast and all these they're all death phantom of the opera' she talks about The Creature from the Black Lagoon and Twilight the Beast represents masculinity the Beast represents that untamed powerful sexual drive of men that women heterosexual women enjoy so even though there are these stories about women sleeping with fish it's the fish are men they're actually represent men these people they take stories literally because they're dumb that's why you read faiths piece on it like I said it's called the HuffPost women would rather have sex with a fish than a man I don't think so believe me although maybe you just fertilize the eggs and it's all a lot easier they don't even know how actually have sex all right tomorrow is the mailbag go to the daily wire.com subscribe if you subscribe for a year's only allows a hundred bucks and you get the leftist to your tumblr and you get to
