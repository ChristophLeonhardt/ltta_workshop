00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,484
[fake crying]

2
00:00:01,484 --> 00:00:02,220
[music]

3
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,710
Lassie would certainly free
this suffering dog owner

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,170
from her little cubicle.

5
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,910
But what about Ralph, the pug?

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,280
He’s one of 34 dogs that
faced a similar test of empathy.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,080
“Help!”

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,860
Kiki was another.

9
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,735
And there was KOOZA!

10
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:20,055
“Help!”

11
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:22,350
Each dog had to solve
the same problem:

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,020
What to do about an
owner apparently trapped

13
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,960
behind an easily opened door?

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,250
The dogs reacted in
all sorts of ways.

15
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,570
Some became anxious and
circled the room, repeatedly.

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,210
Others headed to a door
at the back of the room

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,250
where the researchers
were, perhaps

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,590
hoping for some human help.

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,660
Others just stared.

20
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,195
Some dog owners cried,
indicating distress.

21
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:46,055
“Help!”

22
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:47,840
[fake crying]

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,700
While others hummed
“Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,”

24
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,905
and said “help” in a
tone that carried no emotion.

25
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:55,010
“Help.”

26
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,110
Some of the dogs,
like poor Kiki,

27
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,817
were so anxious that that
may have even interfered

28
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:01,130
with their ability to act.

29
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,270
[dog crying]

30
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,300
She was one of the dogs that
didn’t complete the test,

31
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,700
as was the case
with several others.

32
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,210
Overall, more than half
the dogs opened the door.

33
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,970
Surprisingly, the dogs
with crying owners

34
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,580
didn’t do any better than
the ones with calm owners.

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,250
But speed told a
different story.

36
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,110
The dogs with crying
owners opened the door

37
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,604
three times as fast.

38
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:27,500
[music]

39
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,190
Hallelujah!

40
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,570
Hallelujah!

41
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,690
Hallelujah!

42
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,843
Hallelujah!”

43
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,990
“Hello, my KOOZA!

44
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,770
Yay!

45
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,180
All right.”

46
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,355
[fake crying]

47
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:41,350
But what happened
to Ralph, the pug?

48
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,630
Was it all too much for him?

49
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:52,097
[sniffling]

50
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:54,130
[music]

51
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,230
Of course not.

52
00:01:55,230 --> 00:00:00,000
Never underestimate a pug.
