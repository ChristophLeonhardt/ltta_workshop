1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
At first glance Emmanuel
Macron and Donald Trump

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,650
seem to be unlikely allies.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,880
“The United States will
cease all implementation

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,100
of the non-binding Paris Accord.”

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,320
“It is an actual mistake — both
for the U.S. and for our planet.”

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,680
“The Iran deal was
one of the worst

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,250
and most one-sided
transactions.”

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,870
“To officially recognize

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,049
Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel.”

10
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,550
“I thought that it was a mistake.”

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,870
Macron, a young centrist,
had won the French election

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,940
by rejecting far-right anger.

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,310
Trump had supported
his rival,

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,580
the staunch nationalist,
Marine Le Pen.

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,320
The two presidents’
first encounter

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,230
last spring was awkward.

17
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,480
Trump extended his arms
and greeting, but Macron

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,540
first approached Angela Merkel.

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,080
And when they did
greet each other,

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,372
Trump gave Macron
of his famous arm yanks.

21
00:00:59,372 --> 00:01:01,830
Their handshakes would come to
take on a life of their own.

22
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,709
“It’s being described as an
epic handshake standoff.”

23
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,000
“Alpha male kind of engagement.”

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,370
“That’s what I call
a French press.”

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,350
“I think we just
surrendered to France.”

26
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,920
It was the beginning of Macron's 
political courtship of Trump.

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,070
Other European leaders, like
Angela Merkel and Theresa May,

28
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,372
have been wary of Trump’s
inflammatory rhetoric

29
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,330
and periodic taunting of some
of the United States’

30
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,380
most trusted allies.

31
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,450
“We work together does not mean
that we are afraid to say

32
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,920
when we think the United
States has got it wrong.

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,230
Retweeting from Britain First
was the wrong thing to do.”

34
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,820
Macron has mostly tried
a pragmatic approach.

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,890
He shrugged off some of
Trump’s provocations.

36
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,300
“I think we should not overplay 
the situation and his tweets.”

37
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,812
At Bastille Day, Macron

38
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:46,270
impressed his
American counterpart

39
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,090
with a military parade in Paris.

40
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,290
“One of the greatest
parades I've ever seen.”

41
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,915
And a promise of
unconditional loyalty.

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,182
There was also
the 30-second handshake.

43
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,680
Macron seemed to make
a point of saying

44
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,510
he and Trump were in close contact.

45
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,150
“I call him very regularly.”

46
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,670
“Probably three to four phone
calls during the past weeks.”

47
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,910
“We have a very
good relationship.”

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,810
But why would
Macron so openly embrace

49
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,410
a president who’s unpopular
at home and abroad?

50
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,640
It’s an attempt to burnish
his reputation as a leader.

51
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:29,380
It’s also to bolster
the perception

52
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,796
that France is the key middleman
between the United States

53
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:34,540
and Europe at a time when the
United Kingdom is grappling

54
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,140
with Brexit and Merkel is
struggling to hold onto power.

55
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,570
But those are intangibles.

56
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,580
On the harder issues
of policy, experts

57
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,380
say Macron's efforts
to try and sway

58
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,410
Trump on everything from the
Iran deal to climate change

59
00:02:47,410 --> 00:00:00,000
have so far come up short.
