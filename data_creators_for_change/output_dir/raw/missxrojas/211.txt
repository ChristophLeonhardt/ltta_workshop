20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,200
right at that point so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea was</font>

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,570
there a note kind of jotted down a few

22
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,910

23
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,879
about four three years later that I

26
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,300
when it really kind of got was<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do</font>

27
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">tip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> writing it was the writing for young</font>

31
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,040
are many of you because there's no man

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,290
in the video feeling I wouldn't do yeah

33
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,080
me too<font color="#CCCCCC"> its are you need to just give</font>

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,150
yourself the time I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do yeah</font>

35
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,770
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite good within those structures</font>

36
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,869
like within kind of an M a corset quite

37
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,909
good way to make you sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and write</font>

38
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,680
absolutely because then you've got

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,360
deadlines that you have to meet ya so

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,799
got you've sort of got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inspiration</font>

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,479
around you but other people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,680
the same situation which i think is

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,299
really really important as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well actually</font>

44
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,880
got a sort of support network around you

45
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,710
all of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really really helps to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

46
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,810
of keep get the momentum going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thing</font>

47
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,549
and actually helps you stick with it as

48
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,649
well because it is a district<font color="#CCCCCC"> II it's a</font>

49
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,869
good introduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the editorial</font>

50
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,850
process as well as you say around<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

51
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,979
when everybody a live tells you their

52
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,170
thoughts on it so used to having a

53
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,460
little bit of criticism or such

54
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,979
absolutely yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it really it</font>

55
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,719
makes you much less precious about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

56
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,700
work actually and it helps you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind</font>

57
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,540
of understand that kind of constructive

58
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,549
criticism isn't your enemy as your

59
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,860
friend it helps you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make your writing</font>

60
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,229
better it's not kind of destructive

61
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,120
criticism you know probably learn how to

62
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,040
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of give it as well which which also</font>

63
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,440
makes you say in your own completely and

64
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,760
that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real valuable things</font>

65
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
it's totally reciprocal so you yeah you

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,500
become more analytical by giving your

67
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,879
opinions on other people's work and also

68
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,330
it helps you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of understand or to</font>

69
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,680
it to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feel confident about</font>

70
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,410
sometimes saying well<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually no I</font>

71
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,489
understand why you're saying that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

72
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:35,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm right doing my and it and</font>

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,050
other times<font color="#E5E5E5"> if everybody's saying the</font>

74
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,269
same thing it's clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the start</font>

75
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:44,879
that there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been tragedy sounds like</font>

76
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,349
such a dramatic work but it is a tragedy

77
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,180
in her life she's lost her wrong

78
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,790
Claire's book especially is quite a

79
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,849
tricky one because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to</font>

80
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,590
give away the plot but also it's quite

81
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,840
it's funny but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tragic at the same</font>

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,599
time so it's kind of you tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

83
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,280
what it's about you know this girl

84
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,519
dealing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the death for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mother and</font>

85
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,650
unexpected be but also and it so buddy

86
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,659
goes on my gosh yes really really

87
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,150
devastating which it isn't famous but

88
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,459
there's also this great strain of humor

89
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,010
it runs through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yes I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hack I know</font>

90
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,050

book they'll make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sound very very</font>

94
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">depressing yeah yeah that wasn't really</font>

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">my intention so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do i do think</font>

96
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,500

<font color="#CCCCCC">the same sort of a feeling I'm gonna get</font>

103
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">across to someone this book is sad for</font>

104
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's also you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really because it</font>

105
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,569
has a lot of humor in a life-affirming

106
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">Claire's agent Katherine Clark</font>

fell in love with it and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

112
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,500
those things where as soon as you read

113
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,590
it you want someone else to read it to

114
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,020
so we've shared it pretty quickly around

115
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,819
the whole team because it felt like

116
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,040
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> really special and and</font>

117

124
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,750

139
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,160
sort of time between when you first got

140
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,640
it sent in by agent and now and so we

141
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,360
saw the initial manuscript around this

142
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">time last year actually because it was</font>

143

147
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,780
of being a year is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of a</font>

148
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,520
typical time frame for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that a</font>

149
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,009
no real typical and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

150
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:51,620
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a cool time frame would say</font>

151
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,710
it does vary from book to book and a

152
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,479
year is kind of standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose and</font>

153
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,060
but sometimes we'll put things in very

154
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,130
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> integral and other</font>

155
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,520
times it will be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a year to</font>

156
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,479
18 months but it was quite a smooth

157
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,360
process I'm really territorially<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

158
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,310
yeah just do we have this island quite

159
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,830
yeah me and what we thought and kind of

160
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,430
how to make it into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book minute yeah</font>

161
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,370
it's always definitely so and so in that

162
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,740
sense I think the editorial process was

163
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,550
actually probably smoothest part oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

164
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,780
that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like little behind the</font>

165
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenes some of the cover and everything</font>

166
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,910
else yeah much longer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> took a little</font>

167
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,349
bit about the cover in kind of because

168
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:40,789
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really beautiful I don't know</font>

169
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:42,139
everything you guys can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it well if</font>

170
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,419
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just put a picture in as well it's</font>

171
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,030
quite like lots of textures on it again

172
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the nature of the</font>

173
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,199
book itself it was quite a hard one to

174
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,300
put it into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cover sometimes I think</font>

175
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,909
khabar breathes just kind of they write

176
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,260
themselves and you know what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be is</font>

177
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,110
what you want to do and but with<font color="#CCCCCC"> year of</font>

178
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,289
the rat I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was definitely</font>

179
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,880
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discussion in house about</font>

180
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,100
what we wanted

181
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,870
we knew we<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted it to be really</font>

182
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,390
striking and impactful we did like a

183
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,780
photographic were drying right yes then

184
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,250
was moment the rat scurrying I don't

185
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,720
think I say to that one it kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yeah</font>

186
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
it went into kind of a pool of designers

187
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,560
and then a kind of all came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

188
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,330
different things and this one pretty

189
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,010
much as soon as we're sorry when young

190
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,370
that's this is the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to tell me</font>

191
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,630
more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah yeah sure and that's</font>

192
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,950
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the great thing about you know</font>

193
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you come to be read a book in your</font>

194
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,670
life though<font color="#E5E5E5"> from everything down to the</font>

195
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">words on the page</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but even the cover</font>

196
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,050
it's out<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I get so much yeah I got</font>

197
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,450
this so much yeah and it's got the

198
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,830
thrill of passing books on as well I

199
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">think going back to sort of hate</font>

200
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,490
evenings or a bit of themes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a book</font>

201
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,400
grief is a big one presumably<font color="#CCCCCC"> off from</font>

202
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,900
the start there's been quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

203
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,370
discussion about that there are a lot of

204
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,690
books with Deb mothers around and

205
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,420
binocular and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go back</font>

206
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,570
and look through children and you know

207
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,200
what would now be young adult literature

208
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,750
there have always been dead mother's new

209
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,580
parents it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there I think</font>

210
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,110
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always want to send them a</font>

211
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,550
copy of like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little princess or</font>

212
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,490
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it it's worse than I</font>

213
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,040
Kevin you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think yeah you've all</font>

214
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,200
done in children's there's quite a lot

215
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">of time you do you have dead parents</font>

216
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,660
because especially in kind of younger

217
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,390
books you need almost the child to be

218
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,760
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of living online</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ernest</font>

219
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,529
yeah choir yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

220
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:40,208
not necessarily case this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font>

221
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,208
think it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a it's a good it's a</font>

222
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,129
good story trait in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lot weighing it</font>

223
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:46,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">out but it's also I think it comes from</font>

224
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,660
a fear when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're a child</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well yeah</font>

225
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,459
it's anything that's right it doesn't

226
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:54,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">make it easier the stories kitty don't</font>

227
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:55,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to go back to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very community</font>

228
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,600
exactly know why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping this thing</font>

229
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,879
cuz a teenager<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it when you're really</font>

230
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to ask kind of the really big</font>

231
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,769
questions that kind of life and death

232
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:07,029
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it you know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

233
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,939
means in almost you know it is that

234
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:11,230
brief and it sort of lessons but it's

235
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,809
also stuff about what what is the point

236
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:16,870
of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> alive yeah and when everyone's</font>

237
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,459
going to die you know yes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really at</font>

238
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:21,100
its very cool that's that's what is well

239
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think that is you know it's those</font>

240
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:24,519
kind of questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you really you</font>

241
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,769
know that's what you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

242
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,540
you're sort of leaving child abandon

243
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're moving out into that kind of yeah</font>

244
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:31,600
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot those are the questions that</font>

245
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,550
you're really grappling grappling with

246
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,129
yeah exactly smoothly and the other the

247
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:37,809
other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> they really stuck out for me</font>

248
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:40,449
was the sort of generation a little bit

249
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,720
there's a grandmother in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> birkin a</font>

250
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,430
parent and a child and a younger<font color="#E5E5E5"> child</font>

251
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,279
yeah I was that a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of conscious</font>

252
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,620
conscious be more or was it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just showing</font>

253
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,389
her family's why it wasn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

254
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:54,730
yes it's more about just families and

255
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,800
how they<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and I think I'm quite</font>

256
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,629
interested in how you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationships</font>

257
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:01,750
between different generations yeah be

258
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,779
very important and very very close you

259
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,879
know that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and as a</font>

260
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,259
teenager obviously your peers will

261
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,350
probably important to you those kind of

262
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,459
relationships that span generations

263
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:15,430
actually have a different kind of value

264
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,920
and yeah yeah and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

265
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,569
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly the thing that would kind of</font>

266
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:21,309
have families and how they work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how</font>

267
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:24,279
they don't always work you know it was

268
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,319
was another thing that I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this I</font>

269
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:28,569
am<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in generally and I think</font>

270
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:31,209
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of is it although it</font>

271
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:32,709
wasn't a really conscious thing I think

272
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's why that came out on</font>

273
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,190
in the book great and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for well I'm gonna</font>

274
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrap it up there but read the bit cooler</font>

275
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,990
