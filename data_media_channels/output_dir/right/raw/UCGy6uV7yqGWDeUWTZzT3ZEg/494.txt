00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,840
we had a counter I mean we were worried

201
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,940
about the fire code<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a great</font>

202
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">evening and we had a range of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah I really enjoyed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting everybody</font>

208
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,450
when almost 300 delegates come to say hi

209
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,700
to the rebel that's a disconnect between

210
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the leadership and the true will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">were saying is why were you banned again</font>

213
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,250
and I honestly can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> articulate it</font>

214
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,720
because I don't even understand it's

215
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">just weird and it</font>

216
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,260
and it's these little quirks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

217
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,610
know everyone's got their<font color="#CCCCCC"> quirks but</font>

scared of the media party<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't</font>

231
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,970
understand why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had been blocked but</font>

232
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,160
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's really</font>

233
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,839

238
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:40,880
us and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know what the fight</font>

239
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,320
is and instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

240
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,110
he's being spiteful and malicious and I

241
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,720
hope I hope Andrew Shearer gets some

242
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,580
courage and maybe take some direction
