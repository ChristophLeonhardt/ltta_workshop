the world's busiest airports London's Heathrow in the UK has been accused of lacks security a former terror suspect with a string of criminal convictions was reportedly given access to sensitive areas like the runway with no background checks made our correspondent an associate O'Connor picks up the story another highly concerning incident circulating in the press here in the UK it's being reported that a former terrorist suspect and a criminal with 17 aliases was able to get a job at Heathrow Airport which is in fact one of the busiest airports in the country without as what's being described as proper security and background checks and being able to allegedly get as close to things like luggage area as well as airplanes it's being reported that this 31 year old man had a criminal record lasting over a decade including for things like threats to kill robbery money laundering and assault now he has been reported to have spent five years behind bars previously and it's said that he was interviewed by anti-terror officials as much as five times in the last two years now those charges against him were dropped however he must have been on some kind of watchlist following all of those developments however this is exactly what is raising questions as to how this story was even able to unravel now curiously this man worked as a kitchen porter in business and first class lounges at Heathrow Airport and he himself has said that the fact that he was able to do so is a disgrace and he was trying to show a loophole in the security system the security procedures are a disgrace and need to be exposed I'm not an extremist or terrorist I love Britain and want to protect it I can't believe how close I can get to the planes and luggage I can't believe stuff at Heathrow don't get checked it's crazy well it seems that Heathrow Airport officials seem to believe that there's not very much to worry about in relation to those developments the conditions of this temporary pause required the individual to be constantly escorted by permanent of staff was also subject to robust and thorough airport security search each time he gain access to certain areas we've contacted the Metropolitan Police who have told us that they would not discuss such matters now it has to be said that this man's temporary pass was active for just several days it's been since been revoked and he no longer has this job but however the fact that this even came out of course raises lots of questions about state of security especially this not being the first time that's something like this unravels I'm now joined by Chris Phillips the former head of Britain's National Counterterrorism Security office mr. Phillips good to have you with us this hour now what do you think what we're seeing here is this particular case is just a one-off and you know what does it say about Heathrow's security procedures do you think well it's not likely to be a one-off and I would suggest that this is probably this similar situation in most airports around the world the simple fact is that airports employ huge numbers of people within there within their grounds some have got certain rights and others haven't and I think one of the big issues for them is is temporary staff and people coming in at short notice and they rely to a great extent on sub contractors and subcontractors coming in have to do the same levels of checks as those that work there full time so I think this is a problem for Heathrow it's a problem for all airports and if you think of the damage that an insider can do they can bring airplanes down as we saw a few years ago in Sharm el-sheikh insider is is one of the most dangerous things that we can face and all airports owe it to us Flyers to make sure that they're doing all the right checks the money the center of this story said the goal of this was to expose the lack of security at Heathrow the person was a terror suspect he had criminal convictions if he'd really wanted to carry out an attack how easy would it have been given the access he had well I think the the airport Heathrow Airport said that he had a very limited pass so that that only allowed him to get to certain parts of the airport and also what we took into the airport had to go through some forum form of search and screening I think it would have been very difficult for him to do anything however that's not the point the point is that all airports should really be making sure that their subcontractors are checked and and accredited with the same degree of accuracy as those people that work there full time so it is worrying and what I would say again this is not just Heathrow this is a problem worldwide if we want to keep ourselves safe when we're flying we need to make sure that the airports and the airlines and the providers of services within airports are really doing their job to accredit staff to make sure that they're not a threat to us who would be held accountable for and such a security lapse and do you think anybody will be held responsible after this expose well of course the reputational issues are for Heathrow but also for the company that employed this man the my understanding is that he was on a short term basis and probably in the catering and from the catering side and of course catering units have real difficulties in in filling their staff up and have to take people sometimes at short notice well that's just not good enough the catering company should make sure that they're doing their checks accrediting people you can't get away with this just because you give a false name there's got to be more to it than that because air airports have been consistently targeted by terrorists and will be consistently terror to targeted in the future so it's really important that the the catering company get their act together and also the airport make sure that the catering companies doing the right thing as well mr. Chris Phillips former head of Britain's National Counterterrorism Security office thank you for your time
