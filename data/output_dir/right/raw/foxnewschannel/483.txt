1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:08,250
>>> THREE GROUPS HAD THIS

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,619
LETTER THAT WAS ASKED TO BE

3
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:09,986
ANONYMOUS.

4
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:12,021
DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND HER

5
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:12,755
STAFF.

6
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:13,489
CONGRESSWOMAN FROM CALIFORNIA

7
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:14,757
AND HER STAFF.

8
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:19,629
AND THE LAWYERS.

9
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:22,498
SOMEBODY BETRAYED HER TRUST.

10
00:00:22,498 --> 00:00:24,100
IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY,

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,202
YOU SHOULDN'T DRIVING.

12
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:26,869
>> Tucker: CHRSTINE BLASEY

13
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:29,138
FORD HAD WANTED TO REMAIN

14
00:00:29,138 --> 00:00:29,505
ANONYMOUS.

15
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:30,806
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TESTIFY

16
00:00:30,806 --> 00:00:31,707
YESTERDAY AND DIDN'T WANT

17
00:00:31,707 --> 00:00:33,409
ANYONE TO KNOW HER NAME.

18
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,044
SHE ONLY WENT PUBLIC WITH THE

19
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:35,778
ALLEGATIONS AFTER SOMEBODY

20
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:36,846
LEAKED THEM TO THE PRESS.

21
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:38,180
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO.

22
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,415
ONLY A FEW PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT

23
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,083
THE LETTER THAT SHE HAD

24
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,252
WRITTEN TO CONGRESSMAN AND

25
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,654
THAT IT MADE ITS WAY TO

26
00:00:44,654 --> 00:00:45,621
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN'S

27
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:45,955
OFFICE.

28
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:47,657
FROM ONE OF THE OFFICES HER

29
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:49,759
IDENTITY MADE IT TO REPORTERS.

30
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,727
WHO DID THAT?

31
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:53,262
AND WHY AREN'T DEMOCRATS

32
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,131
INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT THE

33
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:56,732
IDENTITY OF THE PERSON WHO DID

34
00:00:56,732 --> 00:00:57,099
THAT?

35
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,968
SINCE SUPPOSEDLY THEY CARE SO

36
00:00:58,968 --> 00:01:01,871
DEEPLY ABOUT CHRISTINE FORD.

37
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:05,340
McCARTHY WAS ANS SAYTANT

38
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,943
U.S. ATTORNEY, AND JUDGE WAS A

39
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:08,611
DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN

40
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:09,612
WASHINGTON AND THEY JOIN US.

41
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:11,280
WHY WOULDN'T BE SO HARD TO

42
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,481
FIND OUT HOW THE INFORMATION

43
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:13,716
GOT FROM ONE OF TWO

44
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:14,750
CONGRESSIONAL OFFICES TO THE

45
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,920
"WASHINGTON POST"?

46
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,388
>> TUCKER, IF WE ASSUME IT HAD

47
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:20,890
TO BE ONE OF THE TWO OFFICES

48
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,059
THEN IT SHOULD BE A SMALL

49
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:24,260
WORLD OF PEOPLE.

50
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,562
I THINK THE PROBLEM WE HAVE,

51
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:28,464
FACTUALLY, IS THAT THE FIRST

52
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:31,667
PRESS OUTLET WHO GOT IT, THE

53
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:32,935
INTERCEPT NOW SAYS THAT

54
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:33,836
FEINSTEIN, SENATOR FEINSTEIN

55
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:35,171
WAS NOT THE SOURCE.

56
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:38,574
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE

57
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:40,643
OTHER CALIFORNIA

58
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:41,711
CONGRESSPERSON COULD NOT BE

59
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:42,945
THE SOURCE OR IT COULD HAVE

60
00:01:42,945 --> 00:01:45,715
COME FROM THE LAWYERS OR WHAT

61
00:01:45,715 --> 00:01:46,582
HAPPENS AN ACQUAINTANCE OR

62
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:48,084
FRIEND OF DR. FORD.

63
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:50,553
BUT WHILE IT IS A SMALL AMOUNT

64
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:53,155
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE

65
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,358
CIRCLE OF THE POSSIBLE LEAKER,

66
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:57,593
AND IF YOU MADE AN AGGRESSIVE

67
00:01:57,593 --> 00:01:58,394
INVESTIGATION YOU MIGHT BE

68
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:00,229
ABLE TO GET SOME LEADS

69
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:01,163
QUICKLY.

70
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,666
CERTAINLY, IF KAVANAUGH CAN BE

71
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,800
INVESTIGATED SEVEN TIMES YOU

72
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,536
THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH A ONCE

73
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:07,036
OVER.

74
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:09,338
>> Tucker: YOU WOULD THINK

75
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:09,939
THAT.

76
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:10,806
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

77
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:12,341
>> Tucker: IF YOU CARED

78
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,943
ABOUT CHRISTINE FORD WOULDN'T

79
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:16,379
YOU CARE WHO BETRAYED HER AND

80
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:17,513
OVERTURNED HER LIFE?

81
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:18,247
>> OF COURSE YOU WOULD.

82
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:19,348
BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT IT IS

83
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,416
ABOUT FOR THE DEMOCRATS.

84
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,618
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE ETHICS

85
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:23,286
OR MORALITY OR RIGHTNESS.

86
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:24,454
THIS IS ABOUT POWER.

87
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:26,355
THE DEMOCRATS LEAKED IT, THE

88
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,057
LAWYERS LEAKED IT, MAYBE SHE

89
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:29,425
LEAKED IT OR SOMEONE IN HER

90
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:32,061
FAMILY LEAKED.

91
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:34,497
WE KNOW THE REPUBLICANS DIDN'T

92
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:35,398
LEAK IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

93
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:36,466
HAVE THE LETTER.

94
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,601
SOMEONE WANTED TO USE HER AND

95
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,603
MAKE PARROT OF A PROCESS TO

96
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:41,404
FLAY AWAY AT JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

97
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:44,040
THIS IS PART OF THE DISGUSTING

98
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,241
DISPLAY THAT THE DEMOCRATS

99
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:45,575
CREATED.

100
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:46,809
THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT

101
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:47,844
LOOK LIKE SOMETHING THAT IS

102
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:48,177
SERIOUS.

103
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:50,246
IN FACT, IT'S AWFUL.

104
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:51,948
IT IS DEMEANING THE COUNTRY

105
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:52,782
AND DEMEANING THE SENATE.

106
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,751
I DON'T KNOW WHAT AFFECT IT IS

107
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:56,219
HAVING ON DR. FORD OR WHATEVER

108
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,153
HER NAME IS.

109
00:02:57,153 --> 00:02:58,788
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS

110
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:00,323
IS AN ATTEMPT TO DESTROY A

111
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:01,658
GOOD MAN AND HIS FAMILY.

112
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:03,326
AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE

113
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:03,793
SUCCEEDING.

114
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:05,495
THEY GOT THEIR DELAY ON THE

115
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:06,896
VOTE ON THE STATE FLOOR.

116
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:16,139
THEY MAY ULTIMATELY WIN.

117
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,407
>> Tucker: YOU HAVE BEEN

118
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:18,408
WATCHING THIS AND WHAT DO YOU

119
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:19,843
MAKE OF ALL OF THIS?

120
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:25,315
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED?

121
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:27,050
>> THAT IT IS PHENOMENAL THAT

122
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,351
THE DEMOCRATS COULD NOT MORE

123
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:29,686
CLEARLY SIGNAL THAT WHAT THIS

124
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:31,354
IS ALL ABOUT IS THE DELAY,

125
00:03:31,354 --> 00:03:32,088
DELAY, DELAY.

126
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,189
NO MATTER WHAT THEY ARE

127
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:33,657
TALKING ABOUT.

128
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:34,958
WHETHER IT'S THE VICTIMS OR

129
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,928
THE SURVIVORS OR SOMEBODY

130
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:40,130
PRIVACY OR THE NEED FOR AN

131
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:40,764
F.B.I. INVESTIGATION.

132
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:42,265
IT'S ALL ABOUT DELAY.

133
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:43,700
AND YET THE REPUBLICANS SEEM

134
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,035
TO THINK IF WE JUST GIVE THEM

135
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:46,970
A LITTLE BIT MORE DELAY WE CAN

136
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,805
BRING THIS THING TO CLOSURE.

137
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:50,807
FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T

138
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:51,675
WRAP MY BRAIN AROUND THAT.

139
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:53,176
>> Tucker: I CAN'T EITHER.

140
00:03:53,176 --> 00:03:54,444
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING THIS

141
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:54,811
CYNICAL?

142
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:56,346
YOU HAVE BEEN HERE A LONG

143
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:57,114
TIME.

144
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:57,481
>> NO.

145
00:03:57,481 --> 00:04:01,184
>> I CAME HERE IN 1967.

146
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:01,785
51 YEARS AGO.

147
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:03,754
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING

148
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:04,354
LIKE THIS.

149
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:10,661
TO WATCH SENATOR COON DO AN

150
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:12,262
UMPTIOUS DESCRIPTION HOW

151
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:14,598
WONDERFUL IT WAS TO WORK WITH

152
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:15,365
SENATOR FLAKE AND ALL WE WANT

153
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:17,801
IS A LITTLE MORE TIME.

154
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,469
THE GOOFY, GISTING PERFORMANCE

155
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:20,370
BY THE DEMOCRATS.

156
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,370
THE SENATE USED TO BE A

157
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:21,872
BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

158
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:23,607
NOW IT'S A VERY, VERY UGLY

159
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:26,710
PLACE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

160
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,983
ARE BEING HARMED BY THIS.

161
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:34,051
THIS IS AWFUL.

162
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:35,886
DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE ONE WIT.

163
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:37,154
THEY JUST CARE ABOUT POWER.

164
00:04:37,154 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: TRUE.
