we've got some breaking news out of Hawaii right now Kilauea volcano has erupted from its summit sending huge plumes of ash into the sky just to let you know what you're looking at here this is a web camera these are still pictures that are refreshed every 30 seconds or so NBC's Miguel Almaguer remains on duty force here in Hawaii Miguel what's what's happening on the ground right now well Craig this eruption as you know began just before dawn so we didn't have a clear vision or a clear sight of it but we know that it was a very loud explosion according to the USGS and we were told that a plume cloud shot up 30,000 feet and that would be ash and other debris during our drive in here closer to volcanoes national park it sounded like small pebbles were hitting our windshield that was something that they were concerned about ash and small rock raining down now we don't know if we've had that catastrophic steam explosion which could have sent boulders the size of refrigerators and cars into the air right now it appears that has not happened we're still waiting for confirmation from the USGS but local communities here have been warned of an ash fall event so they are told to stay inside to shut their windows and close their doors as ash fall could certainly dissipate across a large area here now Craig as you know this event has been unfolding for exactly two weeks today it began with a series of earthquakes including a powerful 6.9 and then more than 20 fissures those massive cracks in the ground have split open many of them spewing lava Craig we were talking this morning when just behind me we were in front of a geyser of lava that was shooting several feet high into the air had been rolling around that area for several days those toxic gases sulfur dioxide is still seeping in the air that remains a concern here so this situation still a developing Craig as officials try to keep a close eye on Kilauea which under unfortunately right now Craig it's very cloudy out here and we have rain so we don't have a clear shot of the Kilauea but we were told that plume is rising from the crater at this hour the girl behind me there's this emergency sign that's flashing drive with caution cracks cracks in highway I've heard at least three or four cars behind you this the shelter-in-place order that's been given who is it for and do people seem to be adhering to it it says for local residents in this area and could stretch as far away as Hilo which is about a 45-minute Drive they're asking people to stay inside to keep their windows closed the shelter in place really does apply to many folks but as you can see there are many cars going behind us on our way here many folks were driving through the air or driving through the roads here the ash or plume event doesn't seem to be significant at least at this hour that could of course quickly change that's what officials are concerned about in about 45 minutes they'll be holding a press conference we hope to learn more information not only about that explosion but also the plume event and just how serious it may become that may take some time for it develop imagine of plumes shooting up 30,000 feet into the air it could take some time for it to dissipate and spread and go in multiple directions so that's something we hope to find out in the coming minutes here Craig hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
