you are looking now at new photos coming in to us from the National Mall today here in Washington where more than 5,000 flags are being planted on the lawn each one of those flags they're representing a veteran lost to suicide just this year alone today's major push highlighting that comes as Jason Kander a rising star in the Democratic Party and a war veteran his abruptly announcing he's dropping out of the race for Kansas City mayor citing struggles that affect many of our military men and women PTSD and depression in an open letter Kantor writes he contacted the VA for help about four months ago but adds quote I left boxes unchecked too scared to acknowledge my true symptoms I knew I needed help and yet I still stopped short I was afraid of the stigma I was thinking about what it could mean for my political future if someone found out he goes on to write last Tuesday I found out that we were gonna raise more money than any Kansas City mayoral campaign ever has in a single quarter but instead of celebrating that accomplishment I found myself on the phone with the VA Veterans Crisis Line tearfully conceding that yes I have had suicidal thoughts and it wasn't the first time candor says he finally went to the VA in Kansas City Monday and hopes to return to public life when he's better I'm joined now by Paul rieckhoff the founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America the nonprofit that organized today's event that's happening right now over on the National Mall Paul here with me as well in Washington and garen and Nancy cook so Paul incredibly emotional from Jason Kander here honesty and and clearly sharing his struggles here you call it on Twitter an incredibly courageous decision how do you see this helping other veterans struggling with the same issues well he's a hero you know to step forward and say you need help and to admit that you're struggling with the wounds of war and that's what PTSD is it's an injury that comes from war that the many folks are struggling with is courageous it's brave it's it's heroic and to see the the outflow of support that he's gotten in the last few hours and few days from veterans I think is it's really just a testament to how he's going to encourage other men and women to step forward there are folks who are watching this show or maybe alone who don't know if they can step forward and get help but they can get help and Jason candor's is setting that very this example on the you know most public platform in the world and American politics and it's going to save lives and that's why we're putting these flags on the mall today if you're in Washington and you're near Washington go over to the mall see how many people we've lost just this year over 5,000 men and women veterans from across the country to suicide just this year so far so that that's that's why we're talking about it today we applaud Jason Kander and we hope the country will rally around him and rally around our veterans as we go into Veterans Day and through the election campaign this has to be an issue for every candidate what are you gonna do to save the lives of men and women struggling with these issues well you talk about how this was brave this was heroic this was courageous it is also devastatingly common Jason Kander writes in his book about what he went through and he was serving overseas he says I felt fearful way beyond anything I'd ever felt before this was for the first time in my life the raw physical fear of being killed he talks about being ridden with guilt and anger struggling with nightmares when he got back and there are a lot of veterans who go through this 100% you know we see them every day I've gone through it myself after serving as an infantry soldier in Iraq and it can be a lifelong struggle but there is help out there it's really important that Jason Kander also talked about how he had reached out to the Veterans Crisis Line IV and many organizations advocated for the creation of that service and when we continue to promote it there are other alternatives too if you're a veteran struggling not just with PTSD but with homelessness with the VA bureaucracy you can reach out to ia VA and we'll be there to support you another important point here is also military sexual trauma in your last segment you were talking about military sexual trauma that's an important part of what our veterans are facing as well and they're coming forward especially after the Cavanagh hearings we're hearing from a lot of veterans who are stepping forward to get help and to inspire others to do the same thank you for checking out our youtube channel why don't you subscribe it's really easy just click on that button down there and for more news from MSNBC click on any of these videos here for the latest interviews and highlights you can get more videos from MSNBC with our newsletters head over to msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up
