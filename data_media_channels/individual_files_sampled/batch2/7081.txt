chelsey mani is running for a Senate seat in Maryland in fact she has released her first campaign ad and we want to show it to take a look I'm Chelsea Manning and I approve this message we live in trying times times of fear of suppression hate you don't need more or better leaders we need someone willing to fight we need to stop asking them to give us our rights they won't support us they won't compromise we need to stop expecting that our systems will somehow fix themselves we need to actually take the reins of power from them we need to challenge them at every level we need to fix this we don't need them anymore we can do better you're damn right we got this she will be running as a Democrat and she's likely to primary the two-term senator in Maryland Ben Cardin he is doing well in the polls so it'll be a tough primary fight but I'm curious to see how it plays out it's really interesting okay so I know what conventional wisdom is Chelsea Manning's a radical and she spent a lot of time in prison for giving away state secrets gonna be Ben Cardin Ben Cardin is a very well-respected senator he's a solid Democrat and he's popular in the polls I don't agree so I think Chelsea Manning is an American Hero is she radical goddamn righteous are these radical times yes so if Ben Cardin is playing patty-cakes with Trump and he is he can come out there and say well I mean I voted no on the tax cuts I voted no on a lot of the Trump policies he didn't meet by boat by the way where are you Ben Cardin I got no particular animus for Cardin I don't know for madam it's not personal I just know that these Democrats in mass are terrible and so these are the same guys who lost the Senate to the Republicans the first place when they have most of the country on their side I mean that's a fact in terms not just the polling but in the data on the number of people who vote for Democrats versus Republicans in the Senate I know that it of course has to do with how the states are apportioned as well but they keep losing to them right so can Chelsea Manning wind yeah I'm not unaware that it's a long shot but yes these are different times so everybody on TV will snicker Chelsea Manning right like oh no no she is not a trusted member of the establishment in fact the establishment poo-poos her but here's what Chelsea Manning has that other startups and and challengers don't have tremendous name recognition so don't count her out or if you're the Democrat establishment please counter out yeah oh you got this don't worry democratic establishment don't try to fight against her don't spend any resources we'll see what happens now people will say she'll have a hard time raising money I don't know about that small donor money's coming in fast and furious I mean look Alison hearts is running against Dianne Feinstein in California she raised Feinstein and another Democrat in the race among small donors yeah they get funded by giant corporate corporations that is no longer an advantage that is a disadvantage so Chelsea Manning is not gonna get corporate money of course but I I'd be surprised if she didn't raise a ton of small money right so the more people on TV called her radical the I think there's a good chance the better she'll do and you can't go against guys like Ben Cardin or Republican incumbents with weak sauce you can't come in with I'm a shade more progressive than Ben Cardin then what's the point you might as well have been Carden hey Chelsea money Manning is coming up from a completely different direction going you know what know this thing look I here's the parts I loved you saw it there in the Hat let me read it too we don't need more or better leaders we need someone willing to fight that is gonna resonate like these grassroots small donors progressives all across the country I think they're gonna light a fire man I really do now it's Manning at the end gonna be Carden I don't know and I guess I'm the only one in the country who doesn't know among the pundits right because they will all say no way no way you take a hundred to one bet at this point and I would take that bet all day long okay because it's not that's and those are not the correct odds the reality is she does have a chance the other things she said in that we need to stop expecting that our system will somehow fix themselves we need to actually take the reins of power from them I mean how many times have I said about Wolf Pack they're not coming for us we're coming for them you're not Congress isn't going to magically cure itself and go oh my god you're right we all got elected through a corrupt system where we took legalized bribes they're not gonna say that the only way you beat it you fix the system is you beat them you beat them so what if she wins or not and I actually think she can I love that she's running I love this she's fighting I love this she's taking on Cardon primaries don't hurt the any given party the republics have been primary in the living hell out of each other and they keep getting stronger and stronger and stronger more and more victories primaries help and if you're a progressive who doesn't believe in the corporate Democrats they help a ton you know you don't don't get stuck with the choice of lesser of two evils right look we said it during the Bernie Sanders run I'm saying it now I'm saying to you well ahead of time primaries are everything shock the world go show up in primaries while the Cardin who's excited about Cardin is there people and Maryland be like Carton Gordon right no much about Cardin until now to be honest with you um but it might look my commentary isn't about whether or not Chelsea manny has a chance I don't know I don't know I like the message but for me what stands out is the fact that she's so resilient right and and there there's there is actual proof behind what she's saying she is a fighter I mean think about how long she was in solitary confinement think about how long she was abused by the system literally physically abused okay in solitary confinement completely naked over the fact that she was a whistleblower and told us the truth about what our government was wrong roughly doing in in you know other countries like Iraq and so that didn't break her spirit she actually fought through all of that not just for herself but so she could eventually get out which you know thanks to Obama granting her clemency she was able to get out early and now she wants to serve the country as a senator I mean I feel like most people myself included would not want to be in the public limelight at all following that kind of experience but she is a fighter and and for me that says something okay last two things so by the way coincidentally today we're gonna have Breanna Westbrook on rebel headquarters rebel headquarters now the show that comes on after the Young Turks you know Young Turks is live 6 to 8 p.m. every day youtube.com slash The Young Turks and then at 8:05 we have rebel headquarters bana Westbrook is also transgender they keep saying Chelsea Manning's down a lot of the articles only person running who's transgender for Congress no Briana Westbrook is also transgender also running she's a justice Democrat and she's in Arizona she's running to take the despicable Trent Franks seat he's now retiring and out of Congress obviously so we'll hear from her at 8:05 p.m. Eastern today okay but last thing I Chelsea Manning look she does that pass she releases what among the many things she released was the Apache helicopter video it showed that we killed journalists and they killed the first responders who had come in to bring them to the hospital yeah no one got punished for that instead they punished Chelsea Manning for revealing the truth and and then they try to break her in all the ways that Ana described including solitary confinement which and the in the stripping or naked and all that stuff is torture under international law we tortured her they stuffed her in a hole and they put her in prison for all that time and she comes out fighting like this you know it's a me no no no that's why you think she can't win you're wrong and it when I see those senators and they're all so old and decrepit and they got all those corporate patches I'm funded by Exxon Mobil and Lockheed Martin no defense I'm so good on defense right let's start more Wars right you know what I see politically I see dead men walking all those ghosts walking around the Senate like they own the place that isn't your house that's our house and I think when fighters like Chelsea come out they can shock the world so I got news for you guys you thought you were coming for Chelsea Manning and for a while you did for a while you put her in a really dark place but she's come out now and she's coming for you if you're progressive and you can't get behind that go back home you know what I say I say just like Chelsea we come out fighting they're not coming for us we're coming for them in the primaries primary the living hell out of these Democrats and let's take over the party that's a ghost ship let's board it and let's take it if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now tea why tea network.com slash joined get the whole young turks out every day
