I BELIEVE THAT IT'S SIGNIFICANT 

75
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,804
BECAUSE IT MEANS OUR ALLIANCE 

76
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,439
IS BEING EXPANDED TO THE 

77
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,072
ECONOMIC REALM, AS WELL. 

78

83
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,018
WILL BE PROMOTED EVEN FURTHER. 

84
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:57,223
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

85
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,292
WE WILL BE HAVING A SECOND 

86

SUMMIT WITH CHAIRMAN KIM AND 

87
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,793
THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE. 

88
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,228
THE SECRETARY OF STATE WILL BE 

89
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,164
DEALING WITH THAT SUBJECT. MIKE 

90
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,465
POMPEO HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH 

91
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:13,339
THEM AND HE'S GOING TO SEE THAT 

92
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:20,313
THAT WILL BE ANNOUNCED. 

93
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,115
THE LOCATION IS TO BE 

94
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:22,415
DETERMINED. 

95
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,783
WE ARE BOTH VERY MUCH LOOKING 

96
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,218
FORWARD TO HAVING THIS AND IT 

97
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,619
WILL BE BETWEEN NORTH KOREA, 

98
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,655
AND THE U.S. AND BE SIMILAR TO 

99
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,823
THE FORMAT WE HAD BEFORE. 

100
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,493
IT MOST LIKELY WILL BE A 

101
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,861
DIFFERENT LOCATION. 

102
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,231
AGAIN, IT WILL BE ANNOUNCED 

103
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,933
PRETTY SOON AND A LOT OF 

104
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,001
PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. 

105
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,135
I SEE TREMENDOUS ENTHUSIASM ON 

106
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:44,771
BEHALF OF CHAIRMAN KIM TOWARD 

107
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,073
MAKING A DEAL AND I THINK THAT 

108
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,108
IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY GOOD. 

109
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,311
WE ARE NOT IN A RUSH AND 

110
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,446
THERE'S NO HURRY. 

111
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,715
WE GOT BACK THREE MONTHS AGO OR 

112
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,784
SO AND WE'VE MADE MORE PROGRESS 

113
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,819
THAN ANYBODY HAS MADE EVER, 

114
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:01,687
FRANKLY, WITH REGARD TO NORTH 

115
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,622
KOREA AND I BELIEVE NORTH KOREA 

116
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,156
HAS TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC 

117
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:05,324
POTENTIAL AND I BELIEVE THAT 

118
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,325
CHAIRMAN KIM AND THE PEOPLE OF 

119
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,193
NORTH KOREA WANT TO SEE THAT 

120
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:13,199
POTENTIAL AND WE WILL HELP THEM 

121
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,199
TO THAT IN. 

122
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,835
THE RELATIONSHIP IS VERY GOOD 

123
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,037
AND IN SOME WAYS, 

124
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:18,804
EXTRAORDINARY. 

125
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:20,473
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT WE 

126
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,474
WILL BE HAVING THE SECOND 

127
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,208
SUMMIT IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT 

128
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:22,441
FUTURE. 

129
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:30,550
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 

130
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,318

ON. 

136
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,862
WE WANT TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY 

137
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:43,695

I WANT TO SAY THE COUNTRY, THE 

156
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,735
UNITED STATES, AS PRESIDENT 

157
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,905
MOON POINTED OUT WHEN WE FIRST 

158
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,306
MET, THE U.S. IS DOING BETTER 

159
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,308
ECONOMICALLY THAN WE'VE EVER 

160
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:29,709
DONE BEFORE. 

161
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,311
THE NUMBERS ARE OUTSTANDING AND 

162
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,313
NEW NUMBERS WILL BE RELEASED 

163
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,914
THAT I THINK WILL CONTINUE THIS 

164
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,582
FORWARD MARCH AND WE HAVE 

165
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,352
TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL FOR THE 

166
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:39,585
UPSIDE. 

167
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,253
I'M EXCITED ABOUT OUR NEW TRADE 

168
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:41,553
AGREEMENT. 

169
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,556
IT'S A NEW AGREEMENT, NOT AT 

170
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,524
ALL WHAT WAS WRITTEN. 

171
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,093
IT'S A BRAND NEW AGREEMENT AND 

172
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,496
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT FOR 

173
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,597
THE UNITED STATES. I 

174
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,535
BELIEVE IT'S GOOD FOR BOTH 

175
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:55,835
COUNTRIES. 

176
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:56,602
THE NUMBERS THAT WE ARE DOING 

177
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,770
IN THE UNITED STATES, WHETHER 

178
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,573
UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS OR 

179
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,874
EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS -- THIS 

180
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,975
MOMENT -- WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE 

181
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,809
WORKING IN THE U.S. THAN EVER 

182
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:10,483
BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY. 

183
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,752
IT'S A NUMBER THAT PEOPLE DID 

184
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,154
NOT EXPECT TO SEE. 

185
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,822
IT IS A NUMBER THAT NOBODY 

186
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:17,823
THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN, CERTAINLY 

187
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,958

WE ARE NOT EVEN IN TWO YEARS OF

200
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:41,981
COMPANIES MOVING BACK INTO THE 

201
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,250

WE DID SEE A TWEET FROM LINDSEY

00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,099
GRAHAM WHO SAID THAT THE 

301
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,000

WE ARE NOT HEARING A TON FROM 

307
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,772
THE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE IT'S 

308
00:12:53,772 --> 00:13:00,245
CLEAR THEY'VE STILL GOTTEN NEW 

309
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:01,046
INFORMATION ABOUT A SECOND 

310
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,682
ACCUSER AND THEY WANT TO MEET 

311
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,517

312
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:06,318
EXACTLY WHAT THEY WILL DO, 

313
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:06,751
GOING FORWARD. 

314
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:07,452
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN QUITE VOCAL

THERE IS A NUMBER OF THEM 

319
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:32,311

FORD SHOULD BE CANCELED ALL 

322
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:34,613
TOGETHER, BECAUSE THEY THINK 

323
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,547
THE FACT THAT A SECOND ACCUSER 

324
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:36,582
HAS COME FORWARD, IT SHOWS WHY 

325
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,383
THE FBI NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE. 

326
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,017

00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,678

345
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:10,849
HE SAYS THIS IS A WOMAN WHO WAS

IT ALARMED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND 

365
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,824
THERE IS A LOT OF SKEPTICISM 

366
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:53,324
FROM THE REPUBLICANS. 

367
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:54,393
