I'll despite the meddling allegations being over a year old now the media hasn't tired of them yet when NBC recently interviewed Vladimir Putin it questioned him about the issue you believe that America interfered in Russian elections right the u.s. does this all the time but but Russia did not interfere in America's election no there are no plans in Russia to do so it is impossible it is impossible for us why not why wouldn't you first we have principles whereby we do not allow others to interfere in our domestic affairs do not poke our noses into other people's business this is a principle we have this is the first point I wanted to make my second point is that we do not have a comparable number of tools will anyone believe that Russia a country located thousands of kilometers away could use two or three Russians as you have said and whom I do not know to meddle in the elections and influence their outcomes that it sounds ridiculous creating chaos that's the goal a solution yet not long ago President Trump said something absolutely correct he said that if Russia's goal was to sow chaos it has succeeded but it is not the result of Russian interference but your political system the internal struggle the disorder and division Russia has nothing to do with it whatsoever get your own affairs in order first
