joining me now is Jonathan Morgan he's CEO of new knowledge a company that isn't tracking and working to prevent Internet disinformation campaigns on social networks mr. Morgan welcome to the show sir thank you for having me all right so it seems as if all of these social media companies have been claiming their they have put all of these new things in place and literally it's almost like the Muller indictment happened and the shooting happens and we now find out whatever these companies have done doesn't work what's happening here well I think what you're seeing is kind of a pattern the social media companies I think are operating very large platforms it's very complicated to implement solutions that anything of that size and so what we've seen when Isis was manipulating social media to amplify their message as terrorists when Russia was using the social media to manipulate the public conversation in the 2016 elections and now when anybody with an axe to grind about anything decides that they can also manipulate social media to further their agenda the social media companies come back at that and say okay let's focus on a really narrow solution so let's make sure that Isis can't post on our platform or let's make sure that Russia can't post political advertising or can't pay for political advertising on our platform and those things are really good at you know kind of solving a narrow problem and coming up with an immediate solution to whatever the current crisis is but it doesn't solve the systemic problem it doesn't solve the kind of inherent design problems on these platforms that allow for this type of exploitation to take place that allow the bad actors to find the kinks in the system to game the mechanics of how these platforms are designed and amplify their message but you say that you know it's interesting I have a consultant friend of mine and she believes she she makes the argument that Facebook when it had to deal with child pornography they figured out a way to shut it down and they shut it down all the different ways they didn't attack it narrowly they attacked it broadly so her contention is they knew they had to do it with child pornography that there was no loose ends that they could have there they couldn't just narrow cast their fixes and make it just about advertising her theory is that they're afraid of having what they could do to stop this they don't want to do because it may expose their financial gain on this that's a very fair point because we are talking about something systemic that really is inherent in how these platforms function inherent and how these platforms detect what they think is interesting content and surface it to large groups of people inherent to how these platforms keep us on their site engaging with new material consuming new content participating in conversations and ultimately because of that engagement driving up advertising revenue so it really is core to the value that these platforms are providing to their users and their customers advertisers that's really at the sort of central to this discussion about what needs to change if we're going to stop this type of manipulation ongoing it really is central to the whole debate I was just but is it even possible if the entire premise of the business model of Twitter twitter is for something to go viral then then it's impossible to stop they can they don't they are not incentivized to stop this at all I agree I agree I think as long as they're driven by advertising revenue based on this type of social media engagement I'm not sure what the incentive is and I think too if we're being honest that's why it's been so the platforms have been so slow to address this problem because they know there's a final it's such a financial hit to them they don't want to come up with a solution that would work because it doesn't the bottom line would get impacted too much or they want to find exactly they want to find a solution that is the most narrow possible solution that deals with the kind of public outcry and public demand or the pressure that they might be getting from legislators and sort of regulatory bodies right so if they're if they're getting pressured about Russian ads then they'll deal with Russian ads if they're getting pressured about kind of terrorist content then they'll deal with terrorist content but they're not going to I don't think address these underlying issues without continued public pressure and pressure from legislators because you're right they're financially incentivized to keep doing business as usual all right what did Twitter purge and are the complaints from some of the of the sort of some concern in the conservative sphere who say they got too aggressive I think that what's really happened here is it's this is the the conservative community here are in fact victims and not victims of Twitter's purge but victims of the sort of propagandists the the attackers right the people who wanted to spread disinformation and manipulate their online conversation so I can of course from the perspective of people who have lost thousands of followers I you can see why they would be upset or assume that this was targeting the Twitter in fact was targeting the conservative community online but I think that's missing the point all Twitter's doing is focused on accounts that are obviously automated accounts that are obviously coordinating their activity accounts that are obviously sort of spamming and manipulating their platform in the wake of tragedies like the shooting in Florida and they're trying to remove that influence from the conversation - Twitter's credit and I think that the fact that they've become the bad guys in the kind of you know conservative pundit REE is a mistake when in fact the real bad guys are the ones who perpetrated this in the first place and we're setting up these fake accounts and these troll networks in order to try and manipulate the way that they discuss the issues of the day so how I think it's it's kind of putting the blame in the wrong place all right I'm gonna I have so many more questions but I don't have the same amount of time that I could do to get you to answer them so I won't stick you with a tough one to make you answer solve the world's problems in ten
