there's an obvious threat against Anjem Choudary because people are very angry Lee Rigby was killed by one of engine Choudhary's disciples one of Anjem Choudary his disciples also committed the London Bridge terror attack so there's people that want to get back at the guy and understandably so that's part of the protection there but you know looking at some of the restrictions I was looking earlier and we've got things like a banned from preaching or attending certain mosques and the first thing I thought about that was is this the authorities admitting that certain lots of problems and if certain mosques are problems are the authorities therefore Islamophobic one question for it but then this other stuff use of Internet will be supervised bla bla bla but the one that really got to me is he can't leave London which really amazed me because honestly I would say I wouldn't want him in London in the first place the fact that he can't leave London doesn't make me feel any safer London's where he's done his proselytizing and his radicalization and he can't leave I'd rather he was in the Cotswolds you know I'd rather him go to go to I don't know not Mosul these days but let him get with his buddies in the last tiny holdouts of Isis in Syria or Iraq yeah but you raised a good point if he's not allowed to go to certain mosques that implies that the government thinks certain mosques are problem areas I know that in other countries whether it's France Italy or even China but I wouldn't use them as a comparator governments have shut down mosques that are extremists that are violent that have illegal Imams there and the UK has a mosque ever being shut down for its links to terrorism as have you ever heard of a mosque being shut down like a biker gang clubhouse would be no I've never heard of I've never heard that happen and even after about ten years ago there was a documentary called undercover mosque done by hard cash productions and they ended up getting in trouble for being Islamophobic and what they uncovered was really shocking they found ammunition and all sorts being kept in mosques in the UK and it was hard cats Productions and ITV who got in trouble for it and ever since then anyone who dare talk about mosques and radicalization they just think back to what happens to that documentary crew and production team and they don't say anything else that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra Levant show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel da media slash shows you
