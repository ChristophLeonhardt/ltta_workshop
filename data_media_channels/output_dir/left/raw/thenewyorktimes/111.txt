1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,210
Watch what happens when
one octopus attacks another.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,050
See the one coming forward?

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,090
First, it makes
itself taller and it

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,990
changes from
camouflage to very dark.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,040
Those seem to be social
signals that octopus

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,990
is saying, “I’m big, I’m bad,

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,827
and I’m going to
take your spot.”

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,600
And that’s a surprise because
octopuses are solitary

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,010
and there’s very
little evidence

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,700
that they communicate with
each other or change color

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,880
for any reason other
than camouflage.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,000
U.S. and Australian
researchers captured a

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,440
number of these 
aggressive interactions

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,552
when they placed cameras on
the sea floor near Tasmania.

15
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:46,040
There are several
signals that an octopus

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,980
has that say,

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,930
“Look out, here I come.”

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,510
How many they use
at one time seems

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,160
to be related to the intensity
of the confrontation.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,350
They can make
themselves look tall,

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,110
turn very dark,
climb on higher ground

22
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,300
and raise and spread
their mantle.

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,140
Most interactions are
low key and don’t involve

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,840
all these signals.

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,270
Even for octopuses,

26
00:01:11,270 --> 00:00:00,000
sometimes discretion is
the better part of valor.
