YESTERDAY'S MARQUEE RACE,
THE BIG ONE EVERYONE WAS
ANTICIPATING IT WAS THE
GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION
IN VIRGINIA.
THE POLLS HAD TIGHTENED UP
NEAR THE END.
IT ENDS UP THAT HE BEAT THE
POLLING, I THINK IT WAS
DOWN TO THREE OR FOUR POINTS AND
IT LOOKS LIKE HE WILL HIT A
LITTLE BIT SHY OF NINE POINTS.
IT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT
LOOK LIKE THINGS WERE
GETTING CLOSER.
IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE
GETTING CLOSER BECAUSE OF
GILLESPIE'S CHANGE ñ
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SANCTUARY
CITIES WHICH I THOUGHT WAS
A NOVEL APPROACH.
THERE WAS FEARS THAT THAT COULD
FLIP THINGS, IT LOOKS LIKE
IT DIDN'T, IN FACT IT
ACTUALLY HURT HIM.
HE SEEMS TO MOST ACCURATELY BE
DESCRIBED AS A CENTRIST OR
OLD-SCHOOL VIRGINIA DEMOCRAT,
BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
REASONS TO BE HOPEFUL.
HE PREVIOUSLY FOUGHT TO DEFEAT A
RIGHT TO WORK AMENDMENT, IT
HAS DESTROYED A LOT OF
STATES WORKERS RIGHTS.
HE WENT AGAINST MCCALL, THE
PREVIOUS DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNOR ON A MAJOR
PIPELINE PROJECT.
HE POSED HIS EXPANSION OF
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND HAS
ALSO SPOKEN ABOUT INSTITUTING A
CAP IN TRADE IN THE STATE.
IT GIVES YOU CAUSE FOR A
LITTLE BIT OF HOPE.
PREVIOUS VIRGINIA DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNORS HAVE BEEN ON THE
RIGHT SIDE OF THE PARTY EVEN
AMONGST DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS.
IT LOOKS LIKE HE COULD HAVE A
LITTLE BIT OF PROGRESS IN
THAT AREA.
BUT WE WILL SEE.
>>I HOPE SO.
>>YOU CAN'T JUST LET THEM GET
ELECTED AND THEN GO TO SLEEP.
>>HE VOTED TWICE FOR GEORGE W.
BUSH.
THAT IS WHAT MAKES ME
NERVOUS ABOUT THAT GUY.
>>I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF
GOOD REASONS TO BE NERVOUS.
>> A LOT OF REASONS, YES.
>>HE DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS
A CONSERVATIVE.
>>THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WERE AFRAID
IT WAS GOING TO BE CLOSE.
HE KIND OF BUCKLED ON SOME OF
THE SOCIAL ISSUES TOO.
THIS SHOWS YOU THAT TRUMP IS NOT
REALLY SALABLE TO PEOPLE.
WHAT TRUMP WAS SELLING IS
OUTSIDER IS HIM, NOW HE IS
NOT OUTSIDE ANYMORE.
>> YOU THINK GILLESPIE WAS
AN OUTSIDER?
>>NO.
THIS ALSO SHOWS THAT IF YOU
STICK TRUMP TO THE
CANDIDATE, YOU CAN BEAT THEM.
THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE PEOPLE
LIKE KEITH OLBERMANN AND
HILLARY CLINTON SAYING I
WISH FOR GEORGE W.
BUSH DAYS.
SO THEY ARE SEPARATING HIM FROM
THE REGULAR REPUBLICANS
WHICH IS A MISTAKE.
>> TRUMP DOES NOT REPRESENT
REPUBLICANS, SOMEONE LIKE
GEORGE W.
BUSH DOES.
>> HILLARY CLINTON 
DIDN'T GIVE A
SHIT AND SHE DID IT ANYWAY.
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO,
STICK TRUMP TO THE
REPUBLICAN YOU ARE RUNNING
AGAINST, AND YOU HAVE TO
RUN ON ECONOMIC POPULIST IDEAS.
>>THERE
SEEMS TO BE AN ARGUMENT GOING ON
AMONGST RIGHT-WING POLITICIANS
ABOUT WHETHER THERE WAS NOT
ENOUGH TRUMP IN THIS RACE.
FIRST HERE IS VIDEO OF GILLESPIE
CONCEDING AFTER THE RESULTS
BECAME CLEAR.
>> I WANT TO SAY THAT WHILE
DISAPPOINTED AS MANY OF YOU
KNOW MY FAVORITE VERSES ROMANS
8:28,
FOR IN ALL THINGS WE KNOW ñ
FOR WE KNOW IN ALL THINGS THAT
ALL THINGS WORK FOR THE GOOD,
FOR THOSE WHO LOVE GOD AND
ARE CALLED TO SERVE
ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE.
I FELT CALLED TO SERVE, I HOPE
GOD WILL DISCERN WHAT HIS
CALLING IS FOR ME NEXT.
BUT I KNOW THIS, WHATEVER IT IS
AND WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE,
ONE KATHY GILLESPIE
WILL BE BY MY SIDE.
>>SO OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE
THE FAMILY IN THE BACKGROUND.
A COUPLE OF THOSE KIDS ARE
PROBABLY OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
HOW THE RACE WENT.
THERE DAD RAN ON SANCTUARY
CITIES AND VILIFYING AND
DEMONIZING UNDOCUMENTED
IMMIGRANTS AND CONFEDERATE
MEMORIALS.
LIKE THAT GUY REALLY CARES
ABOUT CONFEDERATE MEMORIALS.
SO THIS IDEA THAT ñ IT IS SORT
OF THE CLASSIC REPUBLICAN
THING BUT IT BECAME
MORE VICIOUS.
THE IDEA IS HE ONE ON IT SO
MAYBE OTHER REPUBLICANS CAN.
I NEVER BOUGHT THAT EVEN
BACK BEFORE TRUMP ONE.
JUST BECAUSE TRUMP IS ABLE TO
SKATE BY, THE MEDIA CAN'T
PIN THINGS TO HIM THAT THE
VOTERS DON'T CARE, DOES IT
MEAN EVERY OTHER REPUBLICAN
WILL BE ABLE TO FLIP OFF
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND
GET ELECTED ON THAT.
>>FIRST OF ALL, I'M PRETTY SURE
HE FORGOT THE BIBLE VERSE
HE WAS TRYING TO QUOTE MIDWAY
AND JUST WENT WITH IT ANYWAY.
ACTUALLY READ THAT BOOK COVER
TO COVER BECAUSE YOLO.
TRUMP RAN ON THIS FAKE IDEA
OF A REPUBLICAN POPULIST.
IT WAS COMPLETE SNAKE OIL
BECAUSE IT IS A TOTAL OXYMORON.
BUT HE SOLD THE SNAKE OIL TO
ENOUGH PEOPLE TO WIN.
NOW YOU SEE THAT TRUMP IS
REPUBLICANISM, THAT IS WHAT
THIS IS.
ALL OF HIS POLICIES, ANY OTHER
REPUBLICAN WOULD BE BEHIND.
THAT IS WHY SO MANY OF
THEM APPROVE OF HIM.
WHAT DOES TRUMP LACK THAT MOST
OTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS
DIDN'T?
ANY SOURCE OF SUBTLETY.
THE BEST THING THE DEMOCRATS IN
ANY OPPOSITION CAN DO IS TO
MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNOW
THESE ARE SYNONYMOUS.
THE DIFFERENCE IS THIS GUY
TALKS A LITTLE MEANER.
>> GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT YOU WILL
END UP AS WHEN THE NEXT SET
OF ELECTIONS ROLL AROUND.
SOME PRESIDENTS IN THE PAST,
WHEN THEY HAVE GROWN
UNPOPULAR REALIZE THEY WOULD
HURT THEIR PARTY BY BEING
SEEN WITH THE CANDIDATES.
THEY HAVE THE SELF-AWARENESS
TO SORT OF BACK OFF.
I DON'T THINK TRUMP HAS.
HE WILL BACK OFF AFTER THEY
LOSE, HE WILL MOCK THEM AND
COME UP WITH AN INSULTING
NICKNAME.
SO IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS COME
AROUND, HE WILL BE ALL OVER
THE PLACE.
I THINK DEMOCRATS WILL TRY TO
STICK HIM TO THE REST OF
THE CANDIDATES.
BUT EVEN IF THEY DON'T I THINK
HE WILL.
>> I HOPE SO.
IT'S FUNNY AS GILLESPIE SAYS, I
ANSWERED THE CALL FROM GOD
TO RUN IN THIS RACE, IT TURNS
OUT GOD WAS WRONG ABOUT
THIS RACE TOO . I THINK GOD IS
WORKING FOR NATE SILVER.
>> ALSO GOD WANTED THE IRAQ WAR
AND GOT BEHIND TIM TEBOW.
>>GOD ALSO SUPPORTED 10 PEOPLE
IN THE LAST REPUBLICAN PRIMARY.
>> TRUMP DID WEIGH IN ON THE
RACE, HE TWEETED THIS.
>>THOSE EXTRA CHARACTERS MAN.
>>HE JUST LET ME GRAB
HIM RIGHT BY THE ñ
>> I AM REALLY DREADING THE
280 CHARACTER TWEET.
I DON'T KNOW IF THE COUNTRY IS
READY FOR IT.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE
FORGET, TRUMP LOST VIRGINIA.
SO DID ED GILLESPIE.
WHY WOULD HE TRY TO STICK
MORE TO YOUR POLICIES?
HE LOST VIRGINIA.
>>GOOD POINT.
LET'S GO TO LAURA INGRAM
AGREEING WITH DONALD TRUMP.
>>GILLESPIE
NEVER JUMPED ON BOARD THE TRUMP
TRAIN, HE IS AN OLD BUSH HAND.
I THINK YOU GAVE IT
HIS BEST SHOT.
HE IS WHO HE IS, HE IS NOT A
POPULIST CONSERVATIVE.
A POPULIST CONSERVATIVE LIKE
TRUMP WHO HAS A STRONG
PERSONALITY AND STRONG
MESSAGE DID DO BETTER.
HE DIDN'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME
CAMPAIGNING IN VIRGINIA AND
ED GILLESPIE TRIED TO
DO THIS DANCE.
I THINK IN THE END THAT CAME OFF
AS DESPERATE AND WOULD'VE
HAD GILLESPIE HAD CAMPAIGNED ON
PRESERVING OUR HISTORY,
VIRGINIA FIRST, LAW AND ORDER.
SIMPLE.
>>ISN'T THAT WHAT HE DID?
>>HE DID THAT, THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT HE DID.
STEVE BENNETT BASICALLY SAID
THE SAME THING, GILLESPIE
COULD'VE ONE.
STEVE BANNON BELIEVES THAT
SOMEONE OTHER THAN ANOTHER
PERSON DISAGREES WITH HIM.
A COUPLE DAYS AGO STEVE
BANNON SAID THIS.
SO 48 HOURS OR 72
HOURS AGO GILLESPIE WAS GOING TO
WIN BECAUSE HE EMBRACED TRUMP.
AS SOON AS HE LOSES, ACCORDING
TO STEVE BANNON, HE LOST.
BREITBART WENT WITH
THIS HEADLINE.
THIS IS AFTER BEING INCREDIBLY
SUPPORTIVE OF HIM BECAUSE
HE WAS A DOUCHE BAG.
>>THAT IS FUNNY.
>>THAT IS AN INTERESTING
INTERPRETATION.
STEVE BANNON IS AN FASCINATING
HUMAN BEING MADE OF PLAY-DO
AND GIN.
THE ESTABLISHMENT LOST IN
TRUMP'S ESTABLISHMENT NOW
AND THE UGLY FACES IS UNMASKED.
>> THEY TRIED TO PITCH HIM AS A
POPULIST, BUT HE IS NOT, HE
IS A NATIVIST.
HE TRIES TO TAKE PEOPLE WHO
NORMALLY WOULD AND PERHAPS
SHOULD VOTE FINALLY BASED ON
ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT HAVE
BEEN HOODWINKED BY ñ AND TRIES
TO GET THEM TO FOCUS EVEN
MORE ON PEOPLE KNEELING
OR NOT KNEELING.
>>THAT IS RACE BAITING.
>> OVERALL THEY'RE GOING TO SAY
IF HE DIDN'T EMBRACE TRUMP.
ABC NEWS FOUND IN VIRGINIA ñ
THAT IS NOT GOING TO
REPRESENT ALL VOTERS, BUT THOSE
WHO WERE DRIVEN BY TRUMP
WERE DRIVEN IN OPPOSITION, NOT
IN SUPPORT OF DONALD TRUMP.
THAT WILL HURT A LOT OF
REPUBLICANS IN THE FUTURE.
