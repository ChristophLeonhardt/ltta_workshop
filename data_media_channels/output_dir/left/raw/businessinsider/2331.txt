15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">doubled in two years and the reality</font>

16
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,440
isn't that it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been a lot</font>

18
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,530
mentioning so we're gonna have an

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,239
overhang of probably a half a million

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,949
homeowners who will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into foreclosure</font>

21
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,690
in 2010 that would have gone in in 2009

22
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,620
unemployment is going to drive high

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,930
levels of foreclosure activity well

through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of this year and we have</font>

another batch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly toxic loans that</font>

for foreclosure activity before things

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,780
settle down a little bit i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,240
statistics out there there's about two

million vacant home or 20 million vacant

33
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,920

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,850
the pipeline does that surplus have any

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,939

and in a very measured manner release

these properties back into the

58
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,319
predicated on how how and when those

59
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,230
banks can sell those homes and at what

60
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,000
price I mean one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons we've</font>

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
had these delays is because the lenders

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,150
simply can't afford to take all these

63
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,280
losses right now so a lot of what you're

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,500
seeing in terms of delays are either

65
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,560
subtle or blatant attempts to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,110
defer the losses to a later<font color="#CCCCCC"> day and as</font>

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,810
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank's books get better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

68
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,799
you'll start to see more of these

properties<font color="#CCCCCC"> move given this what do you</font>

70
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the downside and the valuation of</font>

72
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,299

76
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,859
price points you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see wide</font>

the markets<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be largely flat for</font>

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,280
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years so you'll see</font>

80
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,099
either a very very nominal drop in

81
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,900
prices or a very very nominal gain in

82
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,060
prices always some markets<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing better</font>

83
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,739
and worse than others<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know that's you</font>

84
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:11,819
know your basic middle-of-the-road

85
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,010
forecast but we don't see it we do not

86
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,629
see it another ten percent price

87
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,549
decrease at this point so you talked a

88
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:21,000
bit about unemployment I guess the

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,980
foreclosure marker generally lags that

90
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,829
by a year with layoffs still coming wage

91
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:33,769
cuts are we in for doomsday well it I

92
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,389
mean we haven't obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if you</font>

93
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:37,889
look at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen the</font>

94
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,989
worst of it we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen the worst of</font>

95
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,410
it and and well while 2010 maybe the

96
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,060
record year we hope for overall

97
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,609
foreclosure activity we'll probably see

98
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:50,370
more physical bank repossessions in 2011

99
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,260
as this whole process works its way out

100
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,900
so so no we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

101
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this yet The Economist that we talked</font>

to think that you'll you'll see one new

103
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,129
foreclosure action for every six to ten

104
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:05,459
jobs lost eventually and and the

105
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,500
eventually is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key word here in terms</font>

the tail end of those foreclosures

110

there are about a half a million

00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:27,520
that real shadow inventory is probably

146
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,020
more in the neighborhood of two and a

147
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,130
half to two point eight million

I do think you potentially could even

159
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,099
see a recovery much less a drastic fall

160
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,229
off in home prices in terms of mortgage

161
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:02,860
rates have housing prices fallen you

162
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,419
know below the mortgage where the

163
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:09,250
refinancing is not an option yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

164
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,750
two ways to look at that if you're by if

165
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,669
you're buying a house the interest rates

166
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,830
are at record lows right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good</font>

167
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,270
thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the combination of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

168
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the price drops have been</font>

169
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:20,110
extraordinary buying level or the

170
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,300
affordability levels at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all time record</font>

171
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys if you're buying if you're buying</font>

172
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,330
right here you're a homeowner and that's

173
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,919
what one of the problems is with these

174
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,000
loans that are going to be resetting

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,979
this year in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases these</font>

176
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:31,810
homeowners are forty fifty sixty seventy

177
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,729
percent upside down<font color="#CCCCCC"> on loan</font>

178
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:35,169
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> took out two or three years</font>

179
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:36,999
ago so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the interest rates per</font>

180
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:39,819
se it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's how far the home prices</font>

181
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,139
would depreciate out in a short period

182
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,360
of time so they can't refinance those

183
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,069
they can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because in most</font>

184
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:46,360
cases they can't afford<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take that</font>

185
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,370
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of loss themselves and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bank's</font>

186
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,629
really aren't willing at this point to

187
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,490
do a principal balance reduction so it's

188
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,770
a it's a pretty toxic soup so when the

189
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,969
Fed stops buying mortgage-backed

190
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,559
securities in March where is that going

191
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do to rates that's a really good</font>

192
00:06:57,969 --> 00:06:59,349
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's well that's the one</font>

193
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:00,550
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody has a real good answer for</font>

194
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,039
it and and I guess you know I'd have to

195
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:03,939
answer the question with a question

196
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:06,490
which is if it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's going</font>

197
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a calamity in the making do we</font>

198
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,669
really think the feds going to kind of

199
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:13,349
stop buying those those those notes so

200
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,699
we'll see I know the feds going to do

201
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:16,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything humanly possible to keep</font>

202
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,930
rates as low as humanly possible because

203
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,389
they they I think underestimated at the

204
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:24,129
beginning of this cycle<font color="#E5E5E5"> just how</font>

205
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:27,339
devastating a disaster in the home

206
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,379
market would be the overall economy and

207
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:30,759
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they're going to make the</font>

208
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">same mistake twice so in the data that</font>

209
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,779
we've seen without massive government

211
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,050

at houses market is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's still</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the case if you don't qualify for an FHA</font>

Mac or Fannie Mae will buy there is no

216

lending going on there is no secondary

market and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think until we see the</font>

securities a safe investment again and

221
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:01,870
we have money coming into the secondary

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,979

yesterday on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the site and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> showed the</font>

foreclosures are happening and what

231
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,719
observers said from the map it's crystal

clear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama supporters are the</font>

biggest deadbeats of them all thoughts

00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:31,990
ouch no I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

235
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,089
states are twenty percent of the

242
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,390
right now that's just unprecedented I

243
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,410
don't think whatever your political

244
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,910
leanings you can really blame this on

245
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,760
Obama or his supporters in fact what

246
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,500
we're dealing with our loans that were

247
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,290
made before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last election and and</font>

248
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,930
what the real culprit here if you're

249
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,610
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pin blame that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is blamed to</font>

go up and down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> food system</font>
