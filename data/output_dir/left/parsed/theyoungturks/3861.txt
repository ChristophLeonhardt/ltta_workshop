OFTENTIMES AFTER A NATIONAL
TRAGEDY HITS POLITICIANS
ARE TOLD THEY SHOULD NOT EXPLOIT
THAT TRAGEDY FOR POLITICAL
REASONS.
A RECENT EXAMPLE IS DONALD TRUMP
TRYING TO PUSH FOR HIS TAX CUTS
BY USING HURRICANE HARVEY AND
HURRICANE IRMA AS EXAMPLES.
KEEP IN MIND THERE ARE A NUMBER
OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND
PROGRAMS WHO HAVE SPENT A
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES
AND TIME TO HELP PROVIDE RELIEF
TO VICTIMS OF THESE STORMS.
THAT TAKES MONEY.
IT IS WHY IT IS A CURIOUS
ARGUMENT MADE BY TRUMP THAT
THESE TAX CUTS WOULD ACTUALLY
HELP AMERICANS WHEN IT
COMES TO THESE TYPES OF
TRAGEDIES.
HE PROBABLY PUSH THE RED
BUTTON AFTER HE TWEETED THAT.
PEOPLE ARE REALLY SUFFERING
AND THEY NEED RESOURCES, SO
LET'S CUT TAXES SO WE WON'T HAVE
THE RESOURCES TO HELP THEM OUT.
JUST TO GIVE YOU NUMBERS ON HOW
DISASTROUS THIS HAS BEEN.
THIS IS ACCORDING TO A
PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE.
ALSO KEEP IN MIND TRUMP DID NOT
USE THIS STORM TO PUSH A
POLITICAL AGENDA.
HE IS SOMEHOW POLITICIZING THE
STORM TO SUPPORT HIS PROPOSAL TO
CUT TAXES ON THE WEALTHY GOT IN
SOME CASES I THINK IT MAKES
SENSE TO USE A CRISIS OR TRAGEDY
TO MAKE A POINT.
I THINK DEMOCRATS HAVE A REALLY
GOOD OPPORTUNITY HERE TO
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE
CHANGE AND HOW THESE STORMS
WILL BECOME MORE SEVERE AND
WILL HAPPEN MORE OFTEN IF WE
DON'T DO SOMETHING TO CUT CARBON
EMISSIONS.
BUT TRUMP ON THE OTHER HAND IS
LIKE YEAH, CUTTING TAXES IS
ACTUALLY GOING TO HURT SO LET ME
EXPLOIT THESE STORMS TO CUT
TAXES.
WOULDN'T THAT BE SOMETHING IF
WE DID SEE SOMETHING LIKE A HUGE
TRAGEDY AND SAY THIS IS WHY WE
NEED SINGLE-PAYER MEDICARE.
THEY DON'T DO THAT THOUGH.
WHEN THE BE GREAT AFTER A BIG
CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE TO SAY
THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE?
IT IS NEVER HAPPENING BECAUSE
DEMOCRATS ARE ALSO BEHOLDEN
TO THEIR DONORS WHICH IS WHY
THEY CAN'T STAND UP FOR ANYONE.
I FEEL LIKE USUALLY WHEN
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENS,
COMMON SENSE SAYS WHAT CAN WE DO
TO MITIGATE IT IN THE FUTURE?
FOR SOME REASON IF DEMOCRATS TRY
TO FIND SOLUTIONS AS SOON AS A
TRAGEDY STRIKES THEY ARE
IMMEDIATELY CRITICIZED AS
POLITICIZING THE TRAGEDY.
EITHER YOU ARE INCREDIBLY WEAK
AND SO AFRAID OF CRITICISM
THAT YOU WON'T DO ANYTHING FOR
YOU JUST NEVER REALLY
BELIEVED IN THESE POLITICAL
ISSUES YOU CLAIM TO SUPPORT.
BOTH OF THOSE ARE TERRIBLE.
I THINK THAT IS PART OF WHAT
IS WRONG WITH OUR SOCIETY.
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A
NATURAL DISASTER AND YOU
KIND OF SAY WE REALLY NEED TO
ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE YOU
ARE NOT POLITICIZING ANYTHING.
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A
WORTHY CAUSE THAT IS 100%
NECESSARY FOR THE PLANET.
THAT IS WHAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS,
IT CAUSE THAT IS NECESSARY
FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE PLANET.
TRYING TO USE A NATURAL DISASTER
AS A REASON FOR TAX BREAKS IS A
RIDICULOUS CLAIM THAT INVOLVES
SO MUCH MENTAL GYMNASTICS IT
WOULD TAKE 12 NOVELS TO JUSTIFY
IT.
RIGHT.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU GUYS SOME
STATS.
WE WILL GET TO THE CLIMATE
SCIENCE AND A SECOND.
I WANT TO FOCUS ON WHAT THESE
TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY WILL
ACTUALLY DO TO THESE GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE
RELIEF TO STORM VICTIMS.
HERE IS WHAT TRUMP PROPOSES WHEN
IT COMES 
TO TAXES.
BUT IT IS MUCH NICER TO BUILD
MOATS AROUND OUR ESTATES
AND HAVE THE POOR LIVING IN THE
STREETS.
LET'S GET TO HOW THIS WOULD
IMPACT HURRICANE RESPONSE.
CHUMS BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD LEAD
TO SOME FUNDING CUTS.
THE COAST GUARD HAS DONE QUITE A
BIT OF IMPORTANT WORK FOR
THE VICTIMS OF HURRICANE HARVEY
AND IRMA.
HOWARD TAX CUTS GOING TO
HELP THESE PEOPLE?
PLEASE SHARE THAT INFORMATION.
SOMEHOW MIRACULOUSLY PEOPLE THAT
BENEFIT FROM THESE PROGRAMS THE
MOST WELL SOMEHOW DRINK THAT
CONSERVATIVE KOOL-AID AND
THINK I AM STRUGGLING TO PUT
FOOD ON THE TABLE BUT I
WANT THOSE TAX CUTS FOR THE
RICHEST IN THE COUNTRY SO I
CAN BE SCREWED OVER WHEN A
TERRIBLE STORM HITS.
THAT MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE
WORLD.
CONTINUE VOTING FOR TRUMP
PLEASE.
THERE ACTUALLY IS ONE WAY THAT
THIS WOULD MAKE SENSE.
IF EVERY SINGLE RICH PERSON IN
THE WORLD BEHAVED LIKE HARRISON
FORD, MAYBE THE TAX CUTS WOULD
BE OKAY BECAUSE IN THAT CASE
THEY WOULD ALL ñ OTHERWISE IT IS
POSTED
JORDAN FRENCH MADE A
COMMENT TO ME RECENTLY ñ
I WANT TO LIVE IN A SOCIETY
WHERE I RELIES SOLELY ON
RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS.
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING SOME OF
THOSE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS
THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE NEWS
LATELY AND HOW COMFORTABLE THEY
ARE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST
CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE.
IF YOU ARE GAY AND NEED HELP THE
CHURCH GOING TO HELP YOU?
I
DON'T WANT TO GET INTO A
SITUATION WHERE WE ARE
COMPLETELY RELIANT ON PEOPLE
VOLUNTEERING TO HELP, WE NEED TO
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN
PLACE ONCE TRAGEDY STRIKES.
THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE HAVE
IN THEIR HEAD THAT IF
GOVERNMENT DIDN'T DO IT WE WILL
JUST HAVE CHARITIES DO IT.
WE HAVE HAD CHARITIES IN THIS
COUNTRY SINCE WE STARTED.
THERE IS A REASON WHY WE HAD
INSTITUTE MEDICARE.
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE QUIT WORKING
THEY GO INTO POVERTY AND
DIE WITHOUT MEDICINE BECAUSE
THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IT.
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE MEDICARE.
BEFORE MEDICARE THERE WAS A 33%
POVERTY RATE AMONG SENIOR
CITIZENS.
A DECADE LATER IT WAS 11%.
DO YOU THINK CHURCHES
COULD OF DONE THAT?
WE HAD CHURCHES AND SYNAGOGUES
BACK THEN, BUT WE STILL HAD
33% OF SENIORS LIVING IN
POVERTY.
THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE HAVE
THAT WHAT WE JUST LET THE
CHURCHES DO IT ñ THEY DON'T
FREAKING DO IT.
WE HAVE THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN
THE WORLD THE FACE OF THE
EARTH HAS EVER SEEN.
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY 1
MILLION TIMES OVER.
BUT THE GUY WHO RUNS THE AMAZON
OF ASIA, IT IS NOT CHINA THAT IS
SCREWING OVER OUR ECONOMY, IT IS
US BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DISTRIBUTE OUR INCOME.
WE HAVE MORE WEALTH IN
AMERICA THAN WE HAD 10
YEARS AGO OR FIVE YEARS AGO.
PEOPLE ARE POOR.
WHY?
BECAUSE WE HAVE A FAILED
SYSTEM.
WE CALL A SYSTEM THAT TAKES THE
RICHEST COUNTRY AND RENDERS
HALF OF ITS PEOPLE
POOR OR LOW INCOME?
THAT IS A FAILED SYSTEM.
THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THE
CHURCH IS GOING TO FIX THAT
SYSTEM IS FUCKING BULLSHIT.
