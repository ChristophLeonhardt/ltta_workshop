1
00:00:00,437 --> 00:00:00,936
LOT OF QUESTIONS.

2
00:00:00,937 --> 00:00:03,239
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DIGGING

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,273
IN.

4
00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:06,375
IN A NEW OP-ED TONIGHT

5
00:00:06,376 --> 00:00:07,009
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"

6
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:07,743
EDITORIAL BOARD AGREES AND SAID

7
00:00:07,744 --> 00:00:09,445
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RIGHT TO

8
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:11,147
TURN BACK THE CARAVAN, PARTLY

9
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:13,048
BECAUSE IT'S ORGANIZED AND NOT

10
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,283
NECESSARILY TO THE BENEFIT OF

11
00:00:14,284 --> 00:00:15,885
THE MIGRANTS.

12
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:17,052
PLUS, THERE'S THIS HISTORICAL

13
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:20,055
NOTE, "NOT SINCE THE 1980s

14
00:00:20,056 --> 00:00:20,856
BOATLIFT FROM CUBA HAS THERE

15
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:22,691
BEEN A SIMILAR ATTEMPT TO

16
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:23,425
OVERWHELM U.S. IMMIGRATION LAW

17
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:26,462
ON THE PRETEXT OF CELEBRATING

18
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:26,962
AMERICAN FREEDOM."

19
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:28,264
IT GOES ON TO SAY THAT CASTRO

20
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:30,032
SOUGHT TO AT THE CRIMINALS AND

21
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:31,300
MENTALLY ILL ALSO CLIMBED ABOARD

22
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:32,801
THOSE BOATS.

23
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:34,803
NO ONE DOUBTED THE CUBAN HUNGER

24
00:00:34,804 --> 00:00:37,239
TO ESCAPE THE UNINTENDED

25
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,440
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MAYHEM WERE

26
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:39,241
COSTLY.

27
00:00:39,242 --> 00:00:40,910
TONIGHT'S POWER PANEL ON

28
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:41,510
IMMIGRATION, DEMOCRATIC

FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR LISA BOOTHE

31
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:47,850
AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, FORMER

32
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:48,617
ACTING AS DIRECTOR, THOMAS HOMAN

33
00:00:48,618 --> 00:00:50,252
WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU.

34
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:52,521
I WANT TO START WITH SOMETHING

35
00:00:52,522 --> 00:00:54,557
THAT NANCY PELOSI HAD TO SAY IN

36
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:55,291
A JOINT STATEMENT WITH

37
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:55,724
CHUCK SCHUMER.

38
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:57,259
SHE SAID THIS.

39
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,694
THE PRESIDENT IS DESPERATE TO

40
00:00:58,695 --> 00:01:00,129
CHANGE THE SUBJECT FROM

41
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:00,863
HEALTH CARE TO IMMIGRATION

42
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:02,064
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT

43
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:03,232
HEALTH CARE IS THE NUMBER ONE

44
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:06,302
ISSUE AMERICANS CARE ABOUT.

45
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:07,069
LISA, YOUR RESPONSE?

46
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,837
>> I WOULD SAY THE DEMOCRATS ARE

47
00:01:08,838 --> 00:01:10,105
DESPERATE TO NOT TALK ABOUT

48
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:12,441
IMMIGRATION.

49
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:13,075
THE CENTER FOR

50
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:13,742
AMERICAN PROGRESS, A LIBERAL

51
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:15,044
THINK TANK PUT OUT A MEMO TO

52
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:16,912
DEMOCRATS IN COMPETITIVE RACES T

53
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:16,946
DEMOCRATS IN COMPETITIVE RACES L

54
00:01:16,947 --> 00:01:16,979
DEMOCRATS IN COMPETITIVE RACES E

55
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,213
DEMOCRATS IN COMPETITIVE RACES X

56
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:20,849
AND TO AVOID IMMIGRATION BECAUSE

57
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,850
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN ON THE

58
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:22,618
OFFENSE ON IMMIGRATION ON ISSUES

59
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,287
LIKE SANCTUARY CITIES, ON ISSUES

60
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:26,322
LIKE DEMOCRATS CALLS TO ABOLISH

61
00:01:26,323 --> 00:01:28,424
ICE AND WHAT THIS DOES IS

62
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:30,459
PUTTING IMMIGRATION IN THE

63
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,061
CENTER AND THE FOCUS OF THE

64
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:32,962
NATIONAL DEBATE, WHICH IS

65
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:35,831
EXACTLY WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

66
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:37,433
WANTS, IT'S EXACTLY WHAT

67
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:38,434
REPUBLICANS WANT AND REPUBLICANS

68
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:39,268
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD BE

69
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:41,003
OUT THERE HAMMERING IT BECAUSE

70
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:43,105
WHEN YOU SEE VISUALS LIKE THESE

71
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:45,774
MIGRANTS BREAKING DOWN THE GATES

72
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:47,009
INTO MEXICO IT JUST DEMONSTRATES

73
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,645
AND UNDERSCORES CALLS FOR

74
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:51,046
INCREASED BORDER SECURITY.

75
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:52,681
THEY COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER

76
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:53,415
POLITICAL GIFT TO BE HONEST.

77
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,285
>> Shannon: THIS IS WHAT

78
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:57,152
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, EVERY TIME

79
00:01:57,153 --> 00:01:58,887
YOU SEE A CARAVAN OR PEOPLE

80
00:01:58,888 --> 00:01:59,855
ILLEGALLY COMING OR ATTEMPTING

81
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:01,257
TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY

82
00:02:01,258 --> 00:02:01,991
ILLEGALLY, THINK OF AND BLAME

83
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:03,792
THE DEMOCRATS WERE NOT GIVING US

84
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:04,927
THE VOTES TO CHANGE OUR PATHETIC

85
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,495
IMMIGRATION LAWS.

86
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:07,696
OR MEMBER THE MIDTERMS, SO

87
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:08,897
UNFAIR TO THOSE WHO COME IN

88
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:10,299
LEGALLY, WHAT YOU MAKE OF THIS

89
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,667
ASSERTION THAT THIS IS A HUGE

90
00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:12,434
POLITICAL GIFT TO THE PRESIDENT

91
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:14,470
AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME?

92
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:16,038
>> I AGREE THAT IT'S A POLITICAL

93
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,839
GIFT TO THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE

94
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,641
THIS IS A WEDGE ISSUE THAT HE'S

95
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:19,441
BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AT USING

96
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:20,809
DATING ALL THE WAY BACK TO WHEN

97
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,846
HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016.

98
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:24,947
BUT I DISAGREE, VERY MUCH

99
00:02:24,948 --> 00:02:25,614
DISAGREE WITH THE FACT THE

100
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:27,283
DEMOCRATS HAVEN'T BEEN AT THE

101
00:02:27,284 --> 00:02:28,250
TABLE AND TRYING TO WORK IN GOOD

102
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:28,550
FAITH.

103
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:30,753
I SERVED IN THE SENATE AS 2013

104
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:32,521
AS AN AIDE.

105
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:34,290
THAT YEAR WE PASSED

106
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:34,890
COMPREHENSIVE BIPARTISAN

107
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:35,858
IMMIGRATION REFORM.

108
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:36,959
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS CAME

109
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,926
TOGETHER.

110
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:38,560
THERE IS A PROVEN PATH.

111
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:42,431
THERE IS A WAY TO FIND A PATH

112
00:02:42,432 --> 00:02:43,232
FORWARD FOR BIPARTISAN

113
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:44,066
IMMIGRATION REFORM.

114
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:46,402
IF ANYTHING I WAS REALLY STRUCK

115
00:02:46,403 --> 00:02:47,970
AT THE FOX AND FRIENDS PANEL OF

116
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:48,504
INDEPENDENT VOTERS.

117
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:59,715
I THINK IT WAS THIS MORNING.

118
00:02:59,716 --> 00:03:00,449
TO A PERSON, I DON'T WANT TO PUT

119
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,116
WORDS IN HER MOUTH BUT TO A

120
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:01,750
PERSON THEY RECOGNIZED THE

121
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,451
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT'S AT

122
00:03:02,452 --> 00:03:03,185
THE BORDER, THE PLIGHT OF THESE

123
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:03,886
PEOPLE BUT THEY ALSO SAID THEY

124
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:04,586
WANT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS

125
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:05,321
TO COME TOGETHER, THEY ARE TIRED

126
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:06,055
OF THE UNNECESSARY PARTISANSHIP

127
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:06,789
AND SO IS UNFORTUNATE THAT THE

128
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,856
PRESIDENT GET ENGAGES IN THE

129
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:08,624
KIND OF RHETORIC IS ENGAGING IN

130
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,859
WHERE HE ESSENTIALLY MAKES

131
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,127
IMMIGRATION REFORM A ZERO-SUM

132
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:12,428
GAME.

133
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:13,128
I DON'T THINK THAT'S BEST FOR

134
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,063
THE COUNTRY.

135
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:15,497
>> Shannon: HE PUT OUT HIS

136
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:18,233
FOUR PILLARS, GET THESE THINGS

137
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:19,468
DONE, INCLUDING GENEROUS

138
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:20,102
ALLOCATIONS FOR SO-CALLED

139
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:20,869
DREAMERS WHO ARE ALREADY HERE IN

140
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,271
THE COUNTRY AND OTHERS CONNECTED

141
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:23,005
TO THEM THAT HE WOULD SIGN THE

142
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:24,473
BILL.

143
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:25,174
REPUBLICANS COULDN'T GET IT

144
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:27,710
TOGETHER SO THAT HASN'T HAPPENE

145
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:28,077
HAPPENED.

146
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:29,478
NO ONE KNOWS BETTER ABOUT THAT

147
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,212
THAN FORMER ICE DIRECTOR THOMAS

148
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:30,512
HOMAN.

149
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:32,247
WE ARE GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH US

150
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:32,581
TONIGHT.

151
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:34,016
I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING THAT

152
00:03:34,017 --> 00:03:35,451
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID AT HIS

153
00:03:35,452 --> 00:03:36,118
RALLY TONIGHT AND GET YOUR

154
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:39,855
REACTION, THOMAS.

155
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:42,057
>> THAT IS AN ASSAULT ON OUR

156
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:42,391
COUNTRY.

157
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:46,061
THAT'S AN ASSAULT.

158
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:46,995
AND IN THAT CARAVAN YOU HAVE

159
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:49,331
SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE, YOU HAVE

160
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:52,067
SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE, AND WE

161
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:53,669
CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO OUR

162
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,002
COUNTRY.

163
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:55,337
>> Shannon: THOMAS, YOU WOULD

164
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:56,905
KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS PROBABLY

165
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:58,273
THAN THE REST OF US PUT TOGETHER

166
00:03:58,274 --> 00:03:59,007
ABOUT EXACTLY WHO IS SHOWING UP

167
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:02,277
AT THE BORDER.

168
00:04:02,278 --> 00:04:04,880
>> WE TAKE CUSTODY -- ICE TOOK

169
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:05,614
CUSTODY OF EVERYONE -- YOU LOOK

170
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:07,282
AT WHO THEY ARREST THE LAST FEW

171
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:09,551
YEARS BETWEEN 18 AND 20% HAVE A

172
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:10,519
CRIMINAL HISTORY.

173
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,254
THEY FED CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS.

174
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:13,555
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY COME

175
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:14,757
TO THE UNITED STATES SO THERE

176
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:15,824
ARE A LOT OF CRIMINALS COMING

177
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:16,558
ACROSS THE BORDER.

178
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,993
I'M NOT SAYING EVERY CRIMINAL

179
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:19,461
BUT AS FAR AS WHAT THE

180
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:20,763
PRESIDENT, THE COMMENTS HE MADE,

181
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:21,497
WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO PROTECT

182
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:23,665
OUR BORDERS.

183
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,435
I'VE SEEN THE COVERAGE ALSO AND

184
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:28,504
SOMETIMES IT'S SAD TO SEE WHAT

185
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:30,506
YOU SEE BUT I CAN'T BLAME THESE

186
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:32,241
PEOPLE THAT WANT TO COME TO THE

187
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:32,841
UNITED STATES, WHERE THE

188
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:33,542
GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH BUT

189
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:34,676
YOU CAN'T BE A PART OF THE

190
00:04:34,677 --> 00:04:36,278
GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH AND

191
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:36,879
NOT RESPECT ITS LAWS.

192
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,281
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

193
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:40,449
I AGREE 100%.

194
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,452
AS FAR AS THE SECOND SPEAKER,

195
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:44,520
YOU'RE SECOND-GUESSED TALK ABOUT

196
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:45,120
WORKING ON THE HILL AND

197
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:46,388
DEMOCRATS AT THE TABLE,

198
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:47,656
APPARENTLY HE WASN'T ON THE HILL

199
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:50,459
LAST YEAR BECAUSE I WAS THE ICE

200
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,827
DIRECTOR AND THEY WEREN'T AT THE

201
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:52,127
TABLE.

202
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:53,695
I MET A LOT OF LAWMAKERS UP

203
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:55,264
THERE, WE TRY TO SHUT DOWN THE

204
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:56,932
LOOPHOLES, THEY REFUSE TO SHUT

205
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:57,399
DOWN THE POLES.

206
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,834
WHEN I TALK ABOUT SANCTUARY

207
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:01,270
CITIES IN THE ABOLISHMENT OF

208
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:02,070
ICE, YOU WON'T LIVE FIXED

209
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:04,673
LOOPHOLES, YOU ARE ENTICING, YOU

210
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:06,508
ARE ENTICING OTHERS TO MAKE THAT

211
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:07,676
DANGEROUS JOURNEY AND IT'S JUST

212
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:09,244
NOT PEOPLE ENTERING THE COUNTRY

213
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:09,611
ILLEGALLY.

214
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:11,480
NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE BECAUSE

215
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:12,481
THEY ARE RUNNING FAMILIES

216
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:13,649
THROUGH ONE SECTOR, THEY ARE

217
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,416
RUNNING DRUGS AND BAD PEOPLE

218
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:17,453
THROUGH ANOTHER SECTOR TO KEEP

219
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:18,020
MORE OF US TIED UP.

220
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:20,289
IT'S A FACT.

221
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,957
YOU CAN LIKE OR NOT LIKE THE

222
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:22,691
PRESIDENT, BUT HE'S 100%

223
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:24,793
ACCURATE ON THIS ISSUE.

224
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:25,661
>> Shannon: I WANT TO PLAY

225
00:05:25,662 --> 00:05:26,528
SOMETHING THAT ONE OF THE

226
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:30,098
MEMBERS OF THIS CARAVAN TOLD US

227
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:30,432
TODAY.

228
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:33,268
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE

229
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,002
STRATEGY.

230
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:39,041
>> THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

231
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:40,075
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

232
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:41,176
I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO BE

233
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:43,045
ABLE TO STOP EVERYBODY.

234
00:05:43,046 --> 00:05:44,446
>> Shannon: WHAT ABOUT THAT?

235
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:45,314
>> I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP

236
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:46,348
SHOULD TRY BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE

237
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,616
HERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE

238
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:49,618
INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO EXPLOIT

239
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:50,352
OUR LAWS AND THEY ARE DOING

240
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:54,056
THAT -- YOU LOOK AT LOOPHOLES IN

241
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:54,857
THE 2008 ANTIHUMAN TRAFFICKING

242
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:55,958
LAWS THAT MAKES IT VERY

243
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,060
DIFFICULT TO SEND CENTRAL

244
00:05:58,061 --> 00:05:58,727
AMERICAN FAMILIES -- CENTRAL

245
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:00,863
AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS BACK.

246
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:02,331
YOU ALSO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THE

247
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:03,298
FOREST DECREE WHICH BASICALLY

248
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:04,333
MEANS THAT MINORS CAN'T BE

249
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:05,634
DETAINED FOR LONGER THAN 20

250
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:07,302
DAYS, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT

251
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:08,504
WHEN YOU HAVE THESE INDIVIDUALS

252
00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:10,272
COMING OVER AS FAMILY UNITS.

253
00:06:10,273 --> 00:06:11,573
SO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS

254
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:12,274
KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND

255
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:14,443
THEY ARE INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO

256
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:15,177
EXPLOIT THE UNITED STATES LAWS

257
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:17,379
AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, WHEN

258
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,848
YOU SEE THE VISUAL OF THEM

259
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:20,949
BREAKING THROUGH THE GATE INTO

260
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,253
MEXICO, THIS JUST UNDERSCORES

261
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:24,920
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CALLS FOR

262
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:25,621
BORDER SECURITY AND THIS IS

263
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:28,257
GOING TO DRIVE PEOPLE TO THE

264
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:29,258
POLLS, PARTICULARLY THE FACT

265
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:31,193
THAT IMMIGRATION IS THE NUMBER

266
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:31,894
ONE ISSUE FOR REPUBLICANS.

267
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:32,794
>> Shannon: I WANT TO MAKE

268
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:34,196
SURE WE GET DAVE AND THOMAS IN

269
00:06:34,197 --> 00:06:35,564
HERE FOR A FINAL WORD.

270
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:37,866
DATE AND THEN ONTO THOMAS.

271
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:39,268
>> THIS IS A HEART ISSUE.

272
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:40,402
NO ONE WHO HAS WORKED ON THIS

273
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:42,271
ISSUE WOULD SAY IT'S AN EASY

274
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:42,571
ISSUE.

275
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:43,639
BOTTOM LINE, AND I THINK I'M

276
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,474
PROBABLY A BROKEN RECORD ON THIS

277
00:06:45,475 --> 00:06:46,508
WITH YOU, SHANNON.

278
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,010
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT REQUIRES

279
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:49,811
GOOD PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER AND

280
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:52,147
COMPROMISE AND BE REASONABLE.

281
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:52,915
AND THE PROBLEM -- ONE OF YOUR

282
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,883
SPEAKERS TALKED ABOUT IT, HOW

283
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:56,018
DEMOCRATS WERE IN AT THE TABLE

284
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:58,053
IN THE HOUSE, THAT'S NOT TRUE, I

285
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:00,022
DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT PART OF

286
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:00,689
THE CHALLENGES VENDORS THAT

287
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,857
SPEAK OR WRITE IN HOUSE

288
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:02,925
REPUBLICANS LEADERSHIP HAVE

289
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:04,493
ALLOWED MEMBERS OF THEIR CAUCUS

290
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:06,695
TO DICTATE TERMS.

291
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:07,396
THERE'S ACTUALLY BROUGHT

292
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:08,297
BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS IN THIS

293
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:10,465
COUNTRY FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM.

294
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:11,667
SMART PEOPLE NEED TO COME TO THE

295
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:12,868
TABLE, THEY NEED TO COMPROMISE,

296
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:14,670
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY FORWARD.

297
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:18,307
>> Shannon: FINAL WERE TO YOU.

298
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:20,375
>> I WAS ON THE HILL AND I MET

299
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:21,443
WITH A LOT OF LAWMAKERS.

300
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:22,411
YOU CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE LIKE

301
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:24,346
NANCY PELOSI SAY I.C.E. AGENTS

302
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:25,480
ARE OUT TERRORIZING IMMIGRANT

303
00:07:25,481 --> 00:07:26,448
COMMUNITIES.

304
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:27,449
YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE LIKE

305
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,150
SENATOR GILLIBRAND TALK ABOUT

306
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:30,085
ABOLISHING ICE.

307
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:31,320
YOU CAN'T HAVE ALL THOSE LEADERS

308
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:33,288
ON THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SAYING

309
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,690
THE THINGS THEY SAY AND ENTICING

310
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:35,724
FURTHER ILLEGAL ENTRY.

311
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:36,792
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT

312
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:37,259
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

313
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,027
THIS ISN'T JUST -- WHEN YOU

314
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:40,729
ENTICE PEOPLE TO MAKE THAT

315
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,496
JOURNEY PEOPLE WILL DIE ENTERING

316
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:44,700
THIS COUNTRY.

317
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:48,203
WOMEN WILL BE RAPED AND WE

318
00:07:48,204 --> 00:07:51,673
ARE -- THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIO

319
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:52,341
ORGANIZATION, BANKROLLING A

320
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:53,275
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION BY

321
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:54,643
ENTICING ILLEGAL ENTRY AND

322
00:07:54,644 --> 00:07:56,078
HAVING OPEN BORDERS.

323
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,179
ABOLISHING ICE EQUALS OPEN

324
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,846
BORDERS.

325
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:59,081
NOT FIXING THE LOOPHOLES IN THE

326
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:00,916
LAW IS OPEN BORDERS.

327
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:01,683
EVERY PERSON ON THE HILL WHETHER

328
00:08:01,684 --> 00:08:03,485
YOU ARE DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN,

329
00:08:03,486 --> 00:00:00,000
NUMBER ONE RESPONSIBILITY TO
