expecting Justice Anthony Kennedy to step down from his position on the Supreme Court and the fact is that I think most people were hit by a truck over this way most people in the Trump administration were very surprised by this and maybe President Trump was not because maybe be having discussions with Justice Kennedy but there are a lot of people who are very surprised by Justice Kennedy stepping down specifically because most of his legacy is going to be the gay rights stuff right he was the lead writer in in obergefell which was the case that suggested that same-sex marriage had to be the law of land he was socially liberal on issues like abortion but he stepped down while Trump was president and there was a Republican Congress and that cut against a lot of the conventional wisdom I for example thought that he was going to stick it out until there was a Democrat who was presidents that his legacy would be maintained but instead he decided to step down the reason I think he decided to step down besides the fact that he's 81 years old is because I think that he looked at the spate of rulings that the Supreme Court has issued over the last three weeks and what he saw was that there are four votes to overturn a lot of First Amendment protections there been three major cases in the last couple of weeks in which five to four the Supreme Court had decided in favor of free speech but if he were to be replaced by somebody from the left then the left would immediately curtail the right to free speech so for example there was a case that I discussed at length yesterday on the podcast this case in which the Supreme Court decided that you could not be forced to pay into a union for which you did not vote and Anthony Kennedy was on the majority side of that opinion he said that that was violation of the First Amendment well there are four votes to say that the government can force you to pay money to an association like the Union that you don't want to pay into right Anthony Kennedy probably looked at that he said I'm not sure that I want to leave one of Democrats in office because then there'll be five votes in favor of the proposition that the government can force you to pay money to an association that you don't like and then there was a case that came down in the last couple of weeks in which for example it said that mastered the masterpiece cake shop case where it said that if you are a religious Baker you do not have to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding but only this was decided on narrow grounds only because the regulation in question was badly promulgated by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission there are four votes in that case to basically suggest that any Baker in the country can be forced at point of government gun to cater a same-sex wedding and Anthony Kennedy even though he's a gay rights advocate might not be the kind of guy who wants the government to force people to do what they don't want to do at point of gun until you figured okay if I stepped down with a Democrat as president then there will be five votes for the proposition that the government can force any religious person in the country to violate his or her prescriptions when it comes to business so I think Anthony Kennedy looked at the radical left of the court he said I don't want my legacy to be the radical left of the court I'd rather rather than my legacy be the gay rights legacy my guess is that he wants to Chief Justice Roberts and he got a guarantee from him that Roberts would become the new swing vote if same-sex marriage were to come back up for reconsideration and Roberts will work to to tamp that down that the same-sex marriage stuff will stay enshrined in law and his legacy will be enshrined and he'll be fine and he will be able to step down from the court and be replaced by somebody who is more in line with his thinking on First Amendment issues now all of that is speculation but that is my strong inclination is that that's what happened here in any case the Kennedy steps down and that of course opens up a slot on the Supreme Court and a swing vote on the Supreme Court because Kennedy has been the swing vote Kennedy has been the guy who makes the decisions in these five four cases he's been the most powerful guy in the country for a long time and that is a testament to the fact that the Supreme Court has become far too powerful in American life you saw an enormous amount of gnashing of teeth and wailing and rending of garments from the left and tremendous excitement from the right at the fact that this seat is now open on the Supreme Court and Trump is going to get to fill it and the reason for that is that the Supreme Court has become entirely too powerful in the structure of American government if you go back and you look at the Federalist Papers we go through them every week here on the bench Shapiro show when you go back and you look through the Federalist Papers what you see is that they thought that the judiciary was going to be a relatively powerless arm of the government that its job was basically going to be to sit there and say this is constitutional and this is not but not on the grounds they don't like a piece of legislation in fact the Federal Constitution didn't even apply to the States so the federal courts and the Supreme Court in particular we're supposed to be relatively toothless now the Supreme Court gets to decide whether everyone in the country is able to obtain an abortion there is able to kill babies the Supreme Court gets to decide whether anyone in the country is able to get married to anybody else the Supreme Court has entirely too much power and that is reflected in all of the focus on the Supreme Court that's because the left has taken the Supreme Court and used as a tool in order to promulgate its agenda the left sees the Supreme Court as its chief tool in pushing legislation to get camp it can't get passed through popular means the reality is the left was pushing same-sex marriage for example for years and years and they weren't getting anyplace with regard to federal legislation so they went to the courts and the courts gave them what they wanted and the same thing was true on abortion well because you rely on the courts when the courts flipped to the other side there's now a lot of power in in the in the hands of the right we'll talk about what that means and what the courts should be doing in just one second first I want to point out that you know some of us have been dreaming of being on the Supreme Court our entire lives so mr. president if you're listening to this I would just remind you that when 12 year-old Ben Shapiro was playing at the Israeli bons banquet in 1996 Larry King talked specifically about the dreams of that young man hero is 12 years old he'll be accompanied by his father David he began training in a violin at age 5 in addition to the vile any place chess loves baseball completes in track and field his goal is to become the first Orthodox rabbi to sit on the Supreme Court meaning of court court we'll have to close at 3 o'clock on Friday so I'm not saying that it's something that I would I would take something see job that were offered to me I would take I'm not saying that both an Coulter and David Limbaugh said in 2005 when I was still at Harvard Law School I should be on the Supreme Court I'm not saying that I'm 34 years old and I'd be on the Supreme Court for the next 60 years mr. president but if you chose to make that pick would I turn it down I don't know I don't know I mean it's not like I'm I don't know I'm not that enthusiastic about it I mean but but okay in any case in any case Mitch McConnell says that the vote is going to come this fall that this fall there will be a vote on president Trump's replacement justice and you can you can just see the Glee on rich on cocaine Mitch's face so Mitch McConnell is snorted a full line and then he went into Capitol Hill and this is what Mitch McConnell sounds like when he's very very excited about something the Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role by offering advice and consent on president Trump's nominate to fill this vacancy we will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy successor this fall okay that is amped up Mitch McConnell right there that is Mitch McConnell on an 11 on a skeleton he's got that spinal tap yeah that spinal tap volume turned all the way to the top and look Mitch McConnell deserves a lot of credit for this because it was Mitch McConnell who said I am NOT going to move forward on the nomination of Merrick garland and he stood strong in the face of a lot of press attacks and it's Mitch McConnell who is largely responsible for the fact that there will be two picks for the President of the United States President Trump says he is going to pick from the current list which makes a lot of sense he has a list of 25 possibilities there are top five that I'm going to explain in just a few minutes here I'm going to go through the people who are being looked at with the most scrutiny according to Fred Barnes over the Weekly Standard will talk about how a justice should be selected but here as President Trump saying that he's gonna pick from the current list unfortunately there are those of us who are not on the list but president Trump says that he will pick from the list that he's got already have to replace himself obviously we have a list of and president Trump also said last night at a big rally last night and he said that he was honored that Kennedy chose to step down on his watch that he chose to do it during my term in office because he felt confident in me to make the right choice and carry on his great legacy that's why he did one of the things that's amazing about President Trump you really have to you have to admire the man has the devil's luck I mean there's just no question that he has incredible luck now that doesn't mean he doesn't have skill I mean the president is very skilled at a good many things but he's also damn lucky I mean the fact is that George W Bush in his entire eight-year term in office got to replace two justices President Obama and his entire eight-year term in office got to replace two justices neither of them swing justices President Trump gets to replace two justices in the first year and a half of his term whereas an amazing amazing thing and one of those is Justice Kennedy who's a swing justice now President Trump was lucky enough to have Jeb Bush to beat up out on the primaries and then get two billion dollars of free media coverage he was lucky enough to run against the worst candidate in American history who was under full FBI investigation and a week before the election it was revealed that she was under renewed FBI investigation President Trump was lucky enough to be there when Kim jong-un accid we blew up his own nuclear mountain and now he is lucky enough to be there when Justice Anthony Kennedy steps down so you know lefty Gomez famous New York Yankees pitcher once said it's better to be lucky than good it's better to be both lucky and good president Trump is definitely lucky and he certainly has the opportunity to be quite good here now how should justices be selected right how should we determine which justices should be selected because the fact is Republicans have blown opportunity after opportunity on the Supreme Court I may be the only conservative in America who came out against the nomination of Judge Roberts for Chief Justice Roberts way back when way back in 2005 when when Bush nominated Roberts I opposed Roberts because I said the man did not have a long track record of textualism and originalism and he wasn't on record supporting strong textualist positions when it came to controversial cases and anybody who is not openly conservative and I don't mean conservative in the sense that they're politically concerned but anybody who's not textualist or originalist which I'll explain in just a second those people tend to move to the center relatively quickly and I'll explain why that matters in just second first I want to talk a little bit about zip recruiter so your business needs to get better right you need to recruit a new justice to the Supreme Court so where do you look well you could rely on your friends you can rely on people that you know to recommend somebody for a job or you could actually canvass the entire country for the best candidates and that's why you need sip recruiters sip recruiter learns what you're looking for identifies people with the right experience and then invites them to apply to your job 80% of employers who post a job on zipper career get a quality candidate through the site in just one day and zip recruiter doesn't stop there they even spotlight the strongest applications you receive so you never actually miss a great match the right candidates are out there and zip recruiters how you find them businesses of all sizes trust the prakruti for their hiring needs is why we use zipper corridor here at the Daily wire right now my listeners can try zip recruiter for free so go to zip recruiters comm slash daily wire that zip recruiters comm slash daily wire you can try it out for free zip recruiter comm slash daily wire again there's a reason that we use it here at the office and there's no reason for you to waste a lot of time sifting through a bunch of bad resumes when you can have zip recruiter basically do it for you zip recruiter knew there was a smarter way they built a platform that finds the right job candidates for you go check them out right now zip recruiter comm slash daily wire they are the smartest way to hire again zip recruit comm and when use that slash daily where you can try zip recruiter for free ok so when it comes to election of Justices here's what you need you need an open and obvious commitment to originalism in textualism originalism and textualism are the basic notion that when you read a text when you read the Constitution of the United States you are not reading poetry it is not a living document where you get to reinterpret the provisions as you see fit that day that's not what the Constitution was for and you wouldn't interpret any other piece of legislation that way you wouldn't take the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1907 and take that take that piece of legislation and then say you know what I think the Sherman Antitrust Act means that gay marriage is now legal because the document evolves okay that's not how documents work the whole point of writing something down in a document the whole point of legislation is that it is a piece of law promulgated at a particular time with a particular meaning in a particular place and if you want to change that meaning and you can always pass it another piece of legislation you can have a constitutional amendment for example this is why the Constitution has so many amendments because it needs to be changed in many ways the fact is that the Constitution of the United States does not explicitly prohibit for example women from voting but the Supreme Court didn't just go back and reinterpret the Constitution and say the Constitution now means women can vote there's a constitutional amendment that had to be passed in order so that women could vote because that's how legislation works the way legislation works is that it is the legislature that should be doing the legislating it is the job of judges to look at the text see what it means not what they wish it meant now what they hope it meant not what they would like it to mean but what it actually meant at the time that it was written and then they implement that text and again if you want to change that text well that's why you have a legislature that's why you have an elected branch of government the left doesn't believe in this the left believes that reading a text as it is meant to be read is instead an exercise in conservatism it's an exercise in judicial activism to read the Constitution as it was written now if that sounds backwards to you it's because it is it's stupid it's the idea there should be an oligarchy that rules us from above and gets to determine what everything means in their own heads so the latest example of that I mean the overall decision that Kennedy decided is a great case of this where Kennedy looked at the 14th amendment of the Constitution which was about preventing discrimination against black people and said the 14th Amendment to the Constitution mandates that a man can marry a man all across the country now maybe you believe that a man should be able to marry a man that's your prerogative vote for a legislature that says it's fine that's fine but to you the idea the judge is going to determine that from a document that was written in 1917 89 right and a bill of rights that was that was promulgated in 1791 and you're going to take that document and reinterpret it to me whatever you think it ought to mean that is a fundamental breach of judicial duty and that's why when we look at the judges what we should be looking at is who is going to implement the Constitution as written that's their job bro what conservatives want is for the is for the judge is for the the judiciary the Supreme Court to bring back its focus to what it was supposed to do for the Supreme Court to be just as constrained as it originally was what the left once the Supreme Court to do is implement leftist values okay so how does this play out well let's talk about some of the let's talk about some of the potential nominees that President Trump is considering so according to Fred Barnes over at the Weekly Standard the White House is now narrowed down its list of potential Supreme Court nominees to a top five Brett Kavanaugh who's 53 on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals I'm Wolf appar who is 49 on the Sixth Circuit Amy Barrett who's 46 on the Seventh Circuit Thomas Hardiman 52 on the Third Circuit and Raymond Catholic 51 on the Sixth Circuit so all these folks are relatively young you figure that all of them will spend probably 30 years on the court barring serious health problems this is why the idea that Trump gets to shape the court for a full generation here is exactly right now all of that assumes of course that Chief Justice Roberts isn't going to become a Kennedy like swing vote which i think is the dubious assumption but it's possible that you may actually have a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for the first time in legitimately generations so here is what we know about the people who are being discussed Brett Kavanaugh is apparently the front-runner he is also the person who is the most I see okay so I I do not think the president should select Brett Kavanaugh of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals he's a former clerk for Justice Kennedy he was elevated to the federal bench in 2006 after a three-year delay the reason his nomination was delayed was because Democrats were upset over the fact that Cavanaugh used to work for Ken Starr in the office of the Solicitor General and he had the temerity to say that the Clinton administration targeted a Ken Starr so Cavanaugh has been on the court for quite a while his long record he's offered about 300 decisions he recently dissented when the circuit decided that a seventeen-year-old the legal immigrant detainee had a right to an abortion he said that the decision was quote based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong he held in 2011 that the Washington DC ban on semi-automatic rifles and its gun registration requirement were unconstitutional under the Supreme or teller decision which recognized that the second amendments the Constitution was an individual right all of these are good decisions he also held that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau structure was unconstitutional which of course is true as well and holds administrative decision making to a minimum hey Kavanaugh here here's where it starts to get a little bit a little bit dicey Kavanaugh like Chief Justice Roberts is known for working across the aisle he is on the downside apparently a general believer in Chevron deference Chevron deference is the idea that you have these administrative courts these administrative law courts that get to decide your fate and you can't appeal that directly to the judiciary so administrative law courts exist in the executive branch there's a whole branch of thought that says Chevron deference is stupid that if something is decided by for example the EPA that is reviewable by a judge because the EPA is not a judicial system the EPA is a regulatory system Kavanaugh reportedly does not use textualist methods nearly as much as conservatives might wish and worst he upheld Obamacare and sisal versus Department of Health and Human Services as well as 7 Skye vs. holder in which he may have actually crafted the rationale that Chief Justice Roberts eventually used in calling the Obamacare penalties attacks remember that Chief Justice Roberts rewrote Obamacare to make it constitutional suggesting that it was a tax rather than a penalty and it appears that Kavanaugh may have actually created that may have actually created that rationale so I'm not saying the Kavanagh would certainly be another Chief Justice Roberts but I think it's more likely he would be another Roberts than another Gorsuch hey now a move for par he's relatively he's relatively new to the appellate courts he voted to uphold Ohio's method of legal and injection lethal injection and a Michigan Government's meetings opening with a Christian prayer he said that's legal as well he's ruled that monetary donations our form of protected speech under the First Amendment now because the pars record is relatively thin on the court of appeals he's only appointed in the last year and a half there's not much to go on with regard to issues like abortion and religious freedom with that said Professor Brian Fitzpatrick of Vanderbilt Law School described the part is very Scalia like and very Thomas like and sipar has criticized Richard Posner as pragmatism Posner is on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and is a terrible judge he criticized Posner's pragmatism in judicial theory because using pragmatism rather than text would quote elevate judges to the position of coal edges later which is exactly right judges should not be legislating they should be interpreting the law as it is written he has is it textualist was praised scalia himself so if i have to choose the par and Cavanaugh I choose the par the best of the bunch it seems to me is Amy Barrett so Amy Barrett is on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals she was a cause celeb you recall when Democrats began suggesting that her Catholicism was a bar to her ability to be an objective judge and she was supposedly so Catholic that she was gonna use her Catholicism to rule in particular cases she says that life begins at conception she signed a letter from the Becket fund criticizing Obamacare's requirement that employers provide contraceptive coverage calling it a quote grave violation of religious freedom Barrett has written in depth on Justice Scalia's originalism she's evidence support for textualism as well she clerked for Scalia so Amy Barrett would just be first-rate she's the youngest of the bunch she's a woman and it would drive Democrats up a wall because she's Catholic as well so I think Amy Barrett is my number one choice now in just a second I want to get to the last two possibilities for the Supreme Court according to Fred Barnes these are the top five that we are going through right here first I want to talk a little bit about Dollar Shave Club so let's talk about the fact that you look like a schlub okay the reason you look like a schlub is because every time you go to the drugstore you forget to pick up a razor or you forget to pick up the right soap and then you run out of it you're in the shower you look around there's no soap or you're about to shave and you realize that your your razor blades are

so we've been going through the five judges that President Trump is looking at for the Supreme according to Fred Barnes I'm hearing the same thing from from the folks that I know in the White House that these are the judges who are being considered so we've already gone through we've already gone through Brett Kavanaugh of whom I'm deeply skeptical I'm Wolf apar who sounds good but his records a little bit thin Amy Barrett who is a who I think is a deep textualist a deep originalist and would be a very very solid pick now he gets Thomas Hardman so Thomas Hardman you recall was one of the last twos down to Hardiman and Gorsuch from lassie I opposed Hardman I supported Gorsuch good for me that was right gorynych has turned out to be a tremendous justice I am very skeptical of Thomas Hardman Leonard Leo who's one of trumps chief advisors has described Hardman as very much in the mold of Justice Scalia well schooled on the doctrines of originalism and textualism but Hardman has never spoken openly about originalism and textualism and Ritter heard his judicial philosophy so I need to hear his judicial philosophy now in some cases he's done great he stood against a New Jersey law that required showing a justifiable need to allow carrying a handgun publicly he said that violated the Second Amendment in another Second Amendment case he specifically stated that the threshold question in a second amendment challenge is one of scope adding that the inquiry quote reflects an inquiry into text in history that sounds originalist but it's it's still a little bit thin he also hears here's where you die see he also ruled that a plaintiff could sue for sex discrimination on the grounds that he was a male treated badly for being effeminate thus broadening the class of claims under title seven of the Civil Rights Act so title 7 of the Civil Rights Act says you can't discriminate against someone on the basis of sex he broaden that to include you can't discriminate against someone on the basis of their perceived effeminacy which is not the same thing at all right the whole point of title 7 is that men can't discriminate against women in employment that was the point of title 7 it's not that you can't discriminate it may be bad but title 7 doesn't say anything about you made fun of a guy's shirt because you thought that it was pink or something there's nothing in title 7 about that he also has ruled to strike down a fire department's residency requirements which he termed racially motivated in that particular case he equated disparity with discrimination by statistical modeling stating quote minority workforce representation that low suggests discrimination that kind of logic is not textualist or originalist if you look at if you look at disparity and you immediately jump to it must be discrimination then I've got a problem with your legal reasoning he also ruled in favor of an illegal immigrant seeking asylum on the grounds that he was targeted by ms-13 there was a new dilemma and who said that he wanted asylum in the United States and he was refused to silence it he's being targeted by ms-13 in Honduras and he was refused to Thailand because they said well the government supposed to protect you down there anybody targeted by ms-13 doesn't just get to claim asylum in the United States and Hardiman overruled that he said that this guy got to claim asylum Hardiman is also good friends with with President Trump sister who sits on the on this I believe the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and and they are good friends I'm skeptical of Hardman I don't think the Hardman would be a strong pick so that to two out of the four I think would be great picks two would not be particularly strong then we get to Raymond Catholic so Raymond Catholics like Cavanaugh is a former Kennedy Clerk unlike Cavanaugh he's actually expressed his judicial philosophy so in his original confirmation testimony he said I would make sure that the values I would be enforcing if I were a judge are not just my values then I'm not striking something down simply because I don't like it that is a counter majoritarian aspect of our system of our system of government I would start with the text he also said before the Federalist Society the quote the court tries to find the best objective interpretation of the statute based on the statutory text and he said the job of the court was to determine what is the meaning that the citizens bound by the law would have described to it at the time it was approved okay that's sort of definitional originalism we don't have a lot in terms of his in terms of his particular decision-making we do know that in 2016 Catholic slammed the IRS for failing to turn over materials necessary for determining whether they discriminated against conservative groups as far as abortion we don't have much on Catholic Catholic was the Judiciary Committee counsel for Spencer Abraham when he was a senator when Abraham was pushing for a federal abortion ban so here's the bottom line most outspokenly textualist judges on this list are Barrett and Thapar Barrett by a long shot Kavanagh has the most red flags Hardman has red flags - we don't know enough about Catholic at this point from his rulings but his talk of judicial philosophy is promising here is the problem since justices since judge Bork was nominated in the 1980s and and Ted Kennedy the worst of all Kennedys came forward and started bashing the hell out of Judge Bork and you know coined the term working him right just went after him and destroyed him on the public stage since then there has been a tendency by Republican presidents to nominate people who are stealth candidates to nominate people who do not have a long historic record of originalism and textual and you're not even allowed to ask people tough questions you're not allowed to ask them whether you think that Roe was wrongly decided right you see this in judicial hearings all the time in Supreme Court judicial hearing somebody will say well was rolled wrongly decided and the left uses it as the litmus test if you say Roe was wrongly decided they won't vote for you well the right should have litmus test too of course Roe versus Wade was wrongly decided it's a garbage case it is a it is one of the worst recent cases in the history of the United States and it in Coke AIT's a moral standard that is simply not based in the Constitution there's nothing in the Constitution that grants a right to kill your baby in the womb the founders would've been appalled at such a notion the literally nothing is there it said there's an emanation from a penumbra that ends up what does that even mean basically what that means is they're a bunch of justices on the Supreme Court who decided they felt like legalizing abortion that day so they went ahead and they legalized abortion that day hey it seems to me that you should be able to ask judicial nominees we're going to be sitting on the court for the next thirty years what they think of critical cases that they should be able to give honest answers to those critical cases but because Democrats have made it such a cause celeb to destroy people over their positions on controversial cases the easiest way of getting on the court is to be a stealth candidate who's never said anything controversial and then we never have to ask you about the things you've said that are controversial here's my recommendation there 51 United States senators who are Republicans that means that President and thanks to Harry Reid which I'll explain in a moment President Trump does not need 60 votes to get anyone through the Senate so let's ask every question we've got to ask let's vet these candidates all the way down to the ground we cannot afford to blow this if we get another justice Souter if we get another Sandra Day O'Connor if we get another Anthony Kennedy if we get another John Paul Stevens this will have been a massively blown opportunity a massively blown opportunity a historically blow on opportunity that will not come around again because there's this sort of ghoulish death watch that happens on the Supreme Court where we sit around waiting for somebody of the other party to die but the Supreme Court needs to be hemmed back into its constitutional role and its constitutional role is not to implement stuff that I like or stuff that you like it's constitutional role is to read the Constitution and apply the words of the Constitution clearly this is why for example if I were gonna go off the board here but still on president Trump's list I would be going for Senator Mike Lee I think Senator Mike Lee would be the best pick of anybody that's been brought up we know where he stands politically we know where he stands constitutionally I know where he stands constitutionally because I've discussed the Const with Senator Lee senator Lee is a deep textualist a deep originalist and you know that he would vote to constrain the federal government's powers when it violates the the Constitution of the United States and he would also not use his own political preferences as the guideposts for determining what the law allows so I like the idea of Senator Mike Lee I know people are saying well then you won't have that vote in the Senate are you kidding Utah Yeah right Utah's

by on Sunday and it's a lot of fun so check that out as well we are the largest fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation so the best part of all of this is how we got here so the way that we got here is that Democrats in 2013 decided that they were tired of Republicans filibustering judicial nominees now the process of filibustering judicial nominees did not start with Republicans it started under george w bush it started with democrats trying to filibuster people like Miguel Estrada who was nominated to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and when it came time for Barack Obama to stack the courts Republicans who had enough votes in the Senate to stop him filibustered so Harry Reid went forward and he said you know what we need to get rid of the judicial filibuster there will be no more filibuster he's what's called the nuclear option he went to the Senate parliamentarian and got a ruling that suggested that there would be no need for 60 votes to shut down a filibuster instead he just got a 51 vote vote on a rule that would get rid of the filibuster for judicial nominees and Harry Reid celebrated it at the time Harry Reid was excited about it at the time here is Harry Reid he was asked about changing the GOP he was asked about changing the filibuster and whether he was worried that maybe at some point this would turn around and bite him right on the ass and here is what Harry Reid had to say about that why in the world would we care we were trying to protect everybody I mean do they want simple majority of fine I mean all these threats about we're gonna change the rules more as Senator Schumer said what is the choice continue like we are or have democracy okay so he said let him do it if the Republicans ever get in charge let him do it oh yes indeed let them do it and Mitch McConnell cocaine Mitch Reni then when the cocaine Mitch he he said at the time looking exactly the same he said you're going to regret this a lot sooner than you think he looks a little more piqued now because he's done a lot more coke but here is Mitch McConnell saying the Harry Reid you are going to regret this an Orrin Hatch sitting in the background looking just as alive that as he is now here is Mitch McConnell you want to play games set yet another precedent that you'll no doubt come to regret say to my friends on the other side of the aisle you'll regret this and you may regret it a lot sooner than you think boo Mitch McConnell prophet you may regret this a lot sooner than you think indeed indeed Harry Reid tweeted this out Harry Reid owned the libs yesterday say Harry Reid tweeted out thanks to all of you who encouraged me to consider Phil about reform it had to be done Harry Reid owning the web's circa 2013 just just wonderful just wonderful here's an entire montage of leftists at the time suggesting how much they loved the idea of nuking the filibuster this is 23 Democrats and this president going to war with their enemies finally this is a move Democrats had to make Republicans put them in a position where basically Republicans were saying we are not gonna honor the power of the president all this really does is say the president that we elected to actually run the government gets to run the government once the majority is blocked all the time on relatively ordinary things it's not going to tolerate the protection of the minority Ted Cruz is sort of Exhibit A for why the Democrats and why Harry Reid did what they had to do what we had in the Senate which likes to call itself the world's greatest deliberative body we had paralysis and said I think the escalated use of the filibuster has more or less made it obsolete on the other hand the actual history of how the filibusters used is mostly nasty ugly and racist mostly what other political I love it so much so they they couldn't stand the fat the filibuster was the worst thing that ever happened a it had to be stopped it just had to be stopped because it was so bad it was so bad and then they stopped it and guess what yes I can feel the weight of this right here it grows in my hand the weight because the tears are filling up it was here and just in the last five minutes it's gone all the way up to here soon it will overflow President Obama at the time said we need to eliminate the routine use of the filibuster for judicial nominees because come on guys we have to stop this we nee we can't go on I can't go on probably the one thing that we could change without a constitutional amendment that would make a difference here would be the elimination of the routine use of the filibuster in this Senate ahahahahahaha so forgive me for saying a little bit of a shut-in Friday here but um yes you you you all deserve this you had it coming but the richest shred in Freud came courtesy of people wailing yesterday now listen I understand why people are upset the fact is that when you believe that an institution is dedicated to the promulgation of your political ideology and then that institution might be hemmed back into its constitutional boundaries where it won't just declare the game the law of the land based on nothing or won't just declare that abortion is the law of land based on nothing when all of that happens then I understand why you'd be upset but that's because you were stupid about what you think the Supreme Court should have been doing to begin with this was not the job of the Supreme Court but DNC members who thought that they were basically Anthony Kennedy was the last bastion of hope so this audio broadcaster day of DNC members legitimately wailing after Kennedy announced his retirement and is just delicious oh yes people are going crazy yesterday Tommy Vietor I got out of his van and decided from from pod save America folks he decided to tweet fu-uck to which I tweeted back to him Tommy get back in the truck so they said Tommy Vietor really doing yeoman's work there it is funny to watch as Tommy viewers bosses legacy is Pete on like a mattress in Moscow by a russian prostitute it's pretty astonishing and then the best tweet yesterday was definitely from some Rando named Matt ek who tweeted out literally in tears haven't felt this hopeless in a long time with Justice Kennedy leaving we now have two options as Americans get fitted for your Nazi uniform or report directly to your death camp how do you fight the darkness without light my spark is going out hashtag SCOTUS yeah yeah that's probably that's probably gonna happen here is that the constitutional boundaries will be restored and then we'll make you into a Nazi and put you in a death camp that's not an exaggeration at all guys no is it there some of us have been prone to exaggeration about Supreme Court decisions of the past I think my reaction to the Obamacare decision well I think I was right about the the general reaction was probably overstated on Twitter but at least I wasn't saying that we were living in a Nazi death camp so there's that in any case the the the level of leftist ire is insane and the proposed solutions to stopping this just as wonderfully delicious so let's get into how the left has decided that they are going to hold up the nomination of Kennedy's replacement so Chuck Schumer the Senate Minority Leader he says that he's begging Republicans now that they should follow their rule what exactly does he think was their rule he thinks that Mitch McConnell said that we shouldn't vote on a judicial nominee in an election year well know what Mitch McConnell said is you shouldn't vote on a judicial nominee in a presidential election year now I thought that rule was stupid from the beginning I don't think you should vote on in judicial nominee you don't like if you don't have to because why would you why would you vote to confirm a bad Justice just because that's the way things are supposed to go that's not the way things are supposed to go this is why the Senate advises and consents they are not mandated to give their consent but Chuck Schumer says no no I'm gonna pretend that what Mitch McConnell actually said is that we can't vote on a justice in any election year at all midterm general we can't we get none there will never be another vote on the judicial nominee well now somebody remind me when was a Lena Kagan confirmed all right that's was in 2010 in a midterm election year here's Chuck Schumer begging Republicans not to clock him with the tool he gave them back in 2013 along with Harry Reid our Republican colleagues in the Senate should follow the rule they set in 2016 not to consider a Supreme Court justice in an election year okay so yeah that's not gonna happen so congratulations to you Chuck Schumer he handed the baseball bat to the other side and now you are just begging not to be clock with it Kamala Harris she is of course the leader of the crazy caucus of the Democratic Party and she says it's time to play hardball kid Matthew come play some hardball now and the only problem is that all they have at this point is someone observed on Twitter is a wiffle bat so good luck with that here's Kamala Harris saying that somehow using votes they don't have and a filibuster process they themselves nuked they're gonna try to work to stop this are you guys gonna play hardball this time and say we're not gonna let you pass this you're not gonna rush this through us in a few months ID for election day based on every conversation I've had with my colleagues so far this afternoon everybody's prepared to play hardball they have no tools there's no way for them to play hardball they don't have the votes it ain't gonna happen so MA Lizabeth Morin she was sending up some serious smoke signals that she that she was upset about this entire thing in fact she she it sounds like she really wants to refight the Battle of Little Bighorn here Elizabeth Horne so there are Native American senator from Massachusetts who's not Native American in any way it makes a mockery of Native American background with her claims that she is I hear she is explaining that Donald Trump is about to destroy the country wholesale this woman taught at Harvard Law School when I was there she was obnoxious then she's obnoxious now Donald Trump has the opportunity to remake the Supreme Court for a generation a woman's right to decisions over her own body are at risk equal rights equal marriage is also at risk this is the fight of our lives if you want to be in this fight and now's the time raise your voice raise your voice raise your voice we do not want an extremist judge on a United States Supreme Court raise your voice as much as you want gain you ain't got 51 votes you ain't got a majority so listen eventually this will all be turned around and there will be it in time when Democrats are in power again and will suffer the same way the Democrats are now the difference is that Republicans aren't interested in the Supreme Court becoming a tool of their political agenda Republicans just want the Supreme Court to go back to the original text of the Constitution and read the Constitution like any other law would ever be read like the bankruptcy code would be read it is Democrats who have mandated that the Supreme Court is supposed to read the Constitution as a piece of leftist legislation written in 2017 it's absurd and you can see the media response here is is so over-the-top and crazy Comedy Central you know the place for comedy they tweeted this out thanks Justice Kennedy supremely effed that's Allah that's literally what they sweet it out so well done there's so much comedy and you see the comedy there's so great a comedy these people and I know Trevor Noah also lost his mind you said he it feels like all hope is dead yeah sure know all hope is dead for a comedy on your show but here is Trevor Noah I know this news is very painful for a lot of people feels like for the next 30 years America is gonna change in a horrible direction in some ways it feels like all hope is dead and nothing can bring it back or alternatively you could get people elected to office who passed the laws that you like alternatively you could vote alternatively you could stop relying on nine leftists on the Supreme Court to pass your legislative agenda and you could actually go and have that legislative agenda passed by a bunch of Democrats or you could whine about it really loud and cry and whine you know if Chris Matthews go out there and say it's a mere dog I say harbaugh yeah go Chris Matthew get committee show coming you're all angry I'm so angry to go Christmas go it's time for Democrats to play hardball I'm Chris Matthews urging them to do just that it's time to play hardball it's time for me stop coming out of the show and I will finally go and buy a comb because that's how serious I am about this situation the reality is the Supreme Court never should have been this important it is Democrats who made it this important it is leftist who made it this important and now they are reaping what they sell and it is well well deserved okay time for some things I like and then time for some things that I hate so the thing that I like today is a book called the hollow hope by Gerald Rosenberg okay there are a lot of people who believe that the Supreme Court is the great hope for their agenda that the Supreme Court is going to save them the Supreme Court is going to make the country a better place that they're going to do justice there's a very famous story about justice Oliver Wendell Holmes that he was he was deciding a particular case and he was at a dinner party and he goes out from his dinner party and he hops in his carriage and he's about to ride away and some guy starts running after him and and he and and the guy starts screaming at him do justice mr. Holmes do justice and Holmes looks back and he says it's not my job to do justice it's my job to enforce the law yes this is correct okay historically speaking for all the talk about how the Supreme Court has radically changed things people radically overestimate how much the Supreme Court has changed things it is my belief that even if same-sex marriage had not been passed on the federal level by the Supreme Court of the United States that is the direction that the country was moving anyway it is my belief that even without Brown versus Board of Education the country would have moved away from segregation in fact Brown versus Board of Education happens in 1955 it takes until 1964 and the Civil Rights Act to forcibly desegregate the south that's what the that's the argument the Gerald Rosenberg makes Gerald Rosenberg is not a conservative he's professor I believe the University of Chicago Law School and he writes a book called the hollow hope can courts bring about social change and his real answer is no the courts cannot bring about social change the best that they can do is sort of lag behind and then rubber-stamp the direction they think the country is going anyway so the left that wants to use the courts as their tool of social change the answer is if you want social change go out and make social change don't rely on a bunch of non-elected oligarchs who sit there for life to make your agenda happen that's not the job of the Supreme Court it is the job of the Supreme Court to enforce the greatest documents ever conceived of by human beings and that of course be the Constitution of the United States okay time for a couple of things that I hate so Jeffrey Toobin just made an ass of himself on CNN and not not a great shot so Jeffrey Toobin is legal analyst and he is going crazy just like everybody else in the media about how the end of the world is nigh right he the Democrats have all become that weird guy from The New Yorker cartoons carrying around the the placard that says the end is here so here's Jeffrey Toobin doing his the end is here routine with Justice Kennedy gone it will be Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome people will be beating each other up it'll be a massacres in the streets gay people will be running from crowds armed with pitchforks and torches abortions will be unavailable for anyone I mean from his mouth to God's ears here's what he says about abortion you are going to see 20 states passed laws banning abortion outright just banning abortion and because they know that there are now going to be five votes on the Supreme Court to overturn roe v wade okay so let's be straight about this roe v wade does not mandate that abortion becomes illegal again roe v wade if it were overturned simply kicks this the issue back to the states where was from beginning so if you think abortion is gonna be illegal in California you think abortion is gonna be illegal in New York or Massachusetts or a wide variety of other lefty states you're out of your mind okay I'm gonna be illegal there might be heavier restrictions in places like Alabama and Mississippi and Texas and those restrictions may conceive of exceptions for life of the mother for example which is probably the most common exception but for for Jeffrey Toobin to suggest that it's going to be this hellscape where if you want an abortion you can't get one it's just not true first of all I wish it were true I wish it were true but how about the left can make its case in public see the here's the thing the left doesn't actually like democracy when the left talks about how much they love democracy and how this is going to impose on our democracy some sort of burden the reality is they can't get people to vote for their policies so they want judges to do it for them and when Jeffrey Tumen whines about this I don't see why Jeffrey Toobin value set should government what people in Texas think I don't see why my value set should necessarily govern about people in Massachusetts thing I think on the issue of abortion it's a little bit different because if you consider abortion to be a form of murder then you actually do require federal legislation on these issues because it is the job of the government to protect life liberty and property and under the Fourteenth Amendment institution there's equal protection of the laws which in my view should be applied to the unborn as well but with all of that said there's this weird antipathy toward people voting for issues that Democrats don't want them to vote for so they're all pro-choice when it comes to abortion but they're anti pro-choice when it comes to everything else they're anti choice when it comes to religious Baker's they're anti choice when it comes to whether you should have to join a union or pay a union they're anti choice when it comes to whether you should be able to vote on issues like abortion in general so they are utterly inconsistent on these issues so you know it's it's it's just it's ridiculous but this sort of crisis mentality on the left has been exacerbated I mean we had a minute we had Maxine Waters talking about violent uprisings essentially mob justice happening a week ago imagine how bad things are gonna get now I mean I said to somebody in the White House I hope your Secret Service protection is great because I do not trust that there aren't going to be an increased number of nuts who are looking to kill somebody based on the level of antenna of politics in the modern American stem I can't blame that on the media I'll blame the raise temperature on the media but I'm not gonna blame you know assassination attempts on the media but the temperature is just too high for something not to blow that's that's the direction in which this is moving and now with all that said president from given rally last night and president Trump's rallies are always basically hour-long comedy routines I don't think the President Trump is really cooling down the rhetoric at all and this is what his fans love about him his biggest fans love the fact that President Trump likes to engage in the same sort of fisticuffs that the left engages in and I understand the the tendency of the id's who do resonate to this stuff so I think this is helping the the country move forward in any positive way probably not here is Donald Trump going after Joe Crowley who was who was just defeated in a primary by Alexandria Sanchez hacia Sanchez II can't remember her name the socialist 28-year old who's the new face of the Democratic Party he goes after Joe Crowley here's what he had to say last night we had a great evening because we watched that television and we were winning left and right they didn't know what the hell happened and one of my biggest critics a slovenly man Joe Crowley got his ass kicked a slovenly man named Joe Crowley okay I just I love that he has to stick his boot on the guy then first of all Crowley was less anti-trump than the person who replaced him but you know is this is any of this really going to make the country better not really sure I also do love the the blindness of some people to the fact that President Trump is not exactly captain civility so President Trump himself says can you imagine if I said what Maxine Waters said here's what he said Israeli last night Maxine she's a beauty I mean she practically was telling people the other day to assault can you imagine if I said the things she said we demand that he immediately drop out of the race can you imagine seriously if I said that or somebody else said that horrible what you said I can't imagine that because it happened a lot so while I enjoy president Trump's comedic timing I am going to remind people that the President of the United States did say things about punching people with whom you disagree knock the crap out of him I promise you I'll pay your legal fees on June 30th I'd like to punch him in the face maybe you should been roughed up yeah the president is not quite captain civility so before we before we say that all of this is on the Democrats I think a lot of it is on the Democrats but I don't think that it is bringing down the temperature in any real way for the presidents of the United States to use that kind of language all right so I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show we'll see you here
