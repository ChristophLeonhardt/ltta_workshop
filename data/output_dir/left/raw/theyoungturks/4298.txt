1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,679
REX TILLERSON IS ALSO SALTY
ABOUT ALL OF THIS, LET'S

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:04,940
HEAR FROM HIM.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:10,060
>>DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE
OVERWHELMING VOTES IN CONGRESS

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,630
TO PASS THAT WAS A SIGN THAT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT RUSSIA

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,120
TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE THE
RELATIONSHIP?

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,580
>>I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WANT THE TWO MOST POWERFUL

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,470
NUCLEAR NATIONS IN THE WORLD TO
HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,470
I

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,590
DON'T THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WANT US TO HAVE A BAD

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,420
RELATIONSHIP WITH A HUGE NUCLEAR
POWER, BUT I THINK THEY ARE

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,810
FRUSTRATED.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,069
I TOLD PRESIDENT
PUTIN IN MARCH, AND I TOLD

13
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:40,100
FOREIGN MINISTER LAVROV
REPEATEDLY, THE SITUATION IS BAD

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,870
BUT IT COULD GET WORSE.

15
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,239
AND IT
JUST DID, WITH THE ACTION BY THE

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,570
CONGRESS TO PUT THESE SANCTIONS
IN PLACE AND THE WAY THEY DID

17
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,570
IT.

18
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,780
NEITHER THE PRESIDENT NOR I
ARE HAPPY ABOUT THAT, WE WERE

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,489
CLEAR THAT WE DIDN'T THINK IT
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO OUR EFFORTS,

20
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:00,050
BUT THAT'S THE DECISION THEY
MADE, THEY MADE IT IN AN

21
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,440
OVERWHELMING WAY.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,250
>>LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT A BUNCH
OF THINGS.

23
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,250
NUMBER ONE, REX

24
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,640
TILLERSON IS TELLING YOU WE
DIDN'T WANT TO SIGN IT, WE HAD

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,229
NO CHOICE.

26
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,270
LATER WHEN HE SAYS WE
SIGNED THE SANCTIONS BILL, WE

27
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:18,350
TAKE CREDIT FOR IT, REMEMBER
WHEN THEY SAID THEY HATED IT.

28
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,900
THEY LOBBIED AGAINST IT, AND IN
USUAL TRUMP STYLE, IT WAS

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,700
COMPLETELY INEFFECTUAL.

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,189
WHEN
IT'S THAT BIPARTISAN IT SEEMS

31
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:35,679
CLEAR WHAT AMERICA'S
REPRESENTATIVES WANT, BUT

32
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,659
NONETHELESS TILLERSON IS NOW A
POLITICIAN, HE SAYS I WILL MAKE

33
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:42,469
UP WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WANT, THEY WANT WHAT I DO.

34
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,609
THEY

35
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:44,780
DIDN'T VOTE THAT WAY.

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,520
HE IS
LIKE, THEY WANT US TO LIFT THOSE

37
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,860
SANCTIONS SO EXXON MOBIL CAN
MAKE THAT DEAL -- DID YOU JUST

38
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,329
MAKE THAT UP?

39
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,990
MOST IMPORTANT AT
ALL, HE HAS A DOG IN THE FIGHT.

40
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,100
HE WAS CEO OF EXXON MOBIL, THE
NUMBER ONE DEAL AFFECTED BY THE

41
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,199
SANCTIONS IS A $500 MILLION DEAL
WITH EXXON MOBIL THAT RUSSIA

42
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,199
HAD.

43
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,160
THE WHOLE POINT OF
TILLERSON COMING IN WAS TO LIFT

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,160
THOSE SANCTIONS.

45
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,940
TILLERSON GOT A
MEDAL FROM PUTIN, AND THE GUY

46
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,670
WHO OWNS THE LARGEST OIL COMPANY
IN RUSSIA, ONE OF THE OLIGARCHS,

47
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,800
THE SANCTIONS WERE PLACED ON HIM
AS WELL, HE CAN'T COME BACK IN

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,010
THE U.S., HE'S LIKE, I DON'T
LIKE THE SANCTIONS BECAUSE OF

49
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,140
THE ECONOMIC STUFF BUT I ALSO
WANT TO COME BACK TO AMERICA SO

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,170
I CAN RIDE MOTORCYCLES WITH MY
BEST FRIEND REX TILLERSON.

51
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,780
OF

52
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:53,260
COURSE TILLERSON AND TRUMP DON'T
WANT TO DO SANCTIONS, BECAUSE

53
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,520
THEY WANT THEM LIFTED.

54
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,100
TRUMP
OWES THE RUSSIANS, AND

55
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,780
TILLERSON, WHY DID HE GIVE UP
BEING CEO TO DO SOME SECRETARY

56
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,010
OF STATE THINK HE HAS NO
INTEREST IN?

57
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,730
TO LIFT THE SANCTIONS.

58
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,142
>>WHITE DEMOCRATS KEEP HARPING
ABOUT THIS?

59
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:11,142
BY THE WAY,

60
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:13,700
DEMOCRATS AREN'T, WE ARE HARPING
ON IT.

61
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,180
IT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT

62
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,610
MEANS THEY WILL FOCUS ON
POLICIES THAT BENEFIT THEMSELVES

63
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,830
AND THEIR CORPORATE BUDDIES
INSTEAD OF POLICIES THAT BENEFIT

64
00:03:21,830 --> 00:00:00,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
