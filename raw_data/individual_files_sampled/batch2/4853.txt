Hurricane Florence now a category four storm within the last few minutes barreling towards the East Coast officials have ordered mandatory evacuations for the Outer Banks in North Carolina beginning this hour these pictures posted by astronaut ricky arnold show what florence looks like from the space station joining me now is nbc's meteorologist michelle Grossman Michelle that's a pretty extraordinary that picture from the space station tells you just how big this deal is it really does you can see those thunderstorms bubbling up around it it is a strong one as expected it's gonna continue to strengthen at least keep its strength as we go throughout these warm waters so we have a very active season right now we're at the peak day today is that day and right on cue we're seeing many hurricanes category ones category choose but category three hurricane Florence that is the one we're serious about that's one we're talking about if you have not made plans make plans today you have three days to prepare yourself so the latest category for it is winds at 130 miles per hour we expect them to get higher as we get closer to the coastline here so by Tuesday once again a category 4 storm we have very warm waters kind of fuels those storms very low wind shear and that's a good thing to at least strengthen the storms you want windshield to kind of wind shear to pull apart the hurricane that's not going to happen so as we expect a Thursday to Friday landfall along the coast here the threat doesn't end there though we're gonna see this storm move very very slowly as it hits landfall and we're gonna kind of see it sit and spin and just drop lots and lots of rain so a little closer look here is the cone don't focus on the line so much you want to focus on the cone the landfall could be anywhere in between there from Kate Hatteras down to Charleston and we are expecting high winds high surf and we are expecting rainfall up to 20 inches in some spots Andrea hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
