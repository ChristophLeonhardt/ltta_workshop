now one of the reasons that the city of Burnaby finally decided that these people need to be cleared out of the ditch like garbage is the fact that it is extremely dry right now in Burnaby in fact there's a full fire ban on meaning no fires no backyard count fires no nothing right now the ground is incredibly dried the grass crunches under your feet and this protest encampment refuses to comply with the fire ban meaning they're keeping fires campfires burning all the time they called them sacred fires but let me show you the problem with their sacred fire and that's that it is right in front of these highly flammable diesel tanks and a really nice community on the other side that probably doesn't want to burn down because a bunch of hippies around the corner can't follow the rules for the rebel media I'm Shiela gunnery we're here today on Burnaby Mountain covering the camp cloud protest camp and I'll be frank with you the hopeful eviction of all of them now to see all of our footage and to help cover the cost of our travel here and to cover the cost of our security garden if you watch our footage you'll see exactly why we need it go to rebel Burnaby calm you
