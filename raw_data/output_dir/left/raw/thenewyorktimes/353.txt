00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:15,410
I’ve been dreaming about coming
to New York for seven years.

2
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:21,060
I knew I would be happy walking
the streets of New York.

3
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,770
This will be my first time to see
the Christmas tree at the center.

4
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,564
I love this country
because it offers many services

5
00:00:56,564 --> 00:00:58,909
for people in my condition.

6
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,670
I use audiobooks
for reading books,

7
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,650
and I have a tool
that reads colors.

8
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,920
I was happy to have
made it to the city.

9
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,372
I never felt that
I was a stranger here.

10
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:36,470
I immediately felt that
I belonged in the city.

11
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,930
Honestly, I’ve considered
New York home

12
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,420
even before I came here.

13
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,870
It’s my place.

14
00:01:46,870 --> 00:00:00,000
I will find myself here.
