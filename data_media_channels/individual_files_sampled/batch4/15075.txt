well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and the rest of you and this is Wednesday July 18th and you are tuned in to battleground well I hope you're enjoying this beautiful summer it is summer in southern Ontario that's for sure and I'm sure it is that way elsewhere and speaking of sunny skies potentially some good news emanating from across the pond in the UK as you know the head honcho of rebel media Ezra Levent he is in London covering the Tommie trial and I think we should kick off the show with that in fact why don't we go to one of s.res most recent reports and I'll give you a more immediate updating from some of Asura's because they have wrap for the day over in London so if I can call on mr. producer to go to Ezra's tweet I was startled on IDI I am outside the Royal Courts of Justice and the Strand in Westminster which is really just a neighbourhood of London three of the most senior judges in the entire United Kingdom including the Lord Chief Justice himself for presiding over the appeal Tommy Robinson has four lawyers on the other sides a lawyer for the Attorney General of the United Kingdom we haven't heard from him yet we'll hear that after this short break the two big headlines coming out of the case today so far our number one Tommy is not just appealing his sentence but rather the conviction itself and he's actually appealing his Canterbury conviction from a year ago the second is the shocking treatment of Tommy by the authorities especially in prison refusing to allow him to meaningful meaningfully meaningfully confer with his own lawyers the details were just amazing I'm pleased to say that the judges are allowing us to live tweet from the courtroom subject only to a publication banned covering a rape gang trial in Leeds so if you want a lot of detail minute by minute I encourage you to follow me on Twitter or we'll post this and other videos as we make them at Tommy Trial calm well there you have it folks and of course we have more recent news because they have wrapped for the day in London and Ezra has been treating out tweeting out rather that the Chief Justice says they have a complicated task before them I'm not really sure why it's that complicated given the facts of the matter and given what's being stated at this trial and given that remember his arrest dates back to I believe it was May 25th when Tommy was first picked up outside that courtroom where that Muslim rape gang was going on trial so it's kind of funny when they talk about a complicated task it almost sounds to me like well we're the states where the Chief Justice's we really don't know the law that well and you know this is being thrust upon us and only oh uh you know two and a half months so my spidey senses are kind of tingling there and as Ezra notes as well they hope to complete it that's this complicated task before the end of this month July that I agree with Ezra here he has tweeted that this seems excessively slow and that you'd think if they have to take that much time why not grant Tommy bail in the mean time I mean I don't think Tommy is a flight risk I don't think he is a danger to society at large so I guess what I'm saying here folks is that there seems to be a little bit of vindictiveness here on the behalf of the British justice system when it comes to Tommy Robinson that we really don't see being applied to anyone else far from it actually we see with certain individuals committing certain crimes the justice system bending over backwards to the point of leniency why is there this double standard when it just comes to somebody who is the messenger and I think really what we've learned and if you're honest about it and much of the mainstream media and britain is not honest about this it's that tommy is a political prisoner I really believe that and I think that's disgrace especially for a country with such a rich history of freedom and rights as the United Kingdom so that is what we have on Tommy it looks like we won't hear anything concrete until the end of the month I hope because his shoddy treatment has been highlighted in this court and the authorities should be absolutely ashamed of themselves that they've treated Tommy this way I hope that's going to end we have now shed some light on this and at least in the meantime I know the end of July that's literally less than two weeks away Tommy has a more comfortable run of it and has not denied his basic rights while in prison in the meantime here's a few things you can do number one you can contribute to Tommy's legal fund that's Tommy trial calm and all the money going there is indeed going to Tommy's trial second there is save Tommy calm oh sorry that sorry mr. producer what what is the proper is that save Tommy calm or Tommy trial calm for the tummy legal foot Tommy trial calm indeed I had it right the first time and of course you can get your free tummy ringtone at Tommy ringtone calm and if you want to help rebel report on this issue you can make a donation that's a separate fund from the money that we're raising from Tommy and finally if you want you can tweet hashtag free Tommy and get your opinions out there and let's see what is going on in the UK right now according to our our viewers since work says I ain't paying no lawyers the problem isn't works if you don't pay lawyers especially in a trial where the Chief Justice is calling it a complicated task can you imagine a layperson could your man you know and Tommy is a bright guy could you imagine him defending himself in something that the Chief Justice calls a complicated task you need lawyers and you need good lawyers you need sharks in a trial like this I mean that's why we're raising this money it's not to make a buck off it it's to help Tommy get justice and get out of jail and let's see be MTV right so Tommy can dial it die in jail you're probably right I think that's why he is in solitary he has an incredible number of enemies in prison that would consider that a badge of honor to harm or do something even worse to tell me let's all pray that nothing like that does happen it hasn't happened but it doesn't excuse the fact that the people the guards the people running the prison are denying Tommy his rights that is egregious and it shouldn't be happening and let's see we have miss green eyes X the government should be ashamed of themselves yeah and you know something miss green eyes I don't think the British government realized what they were getting into I thought you know if we go back to May 25th when those US I think it was seven police officers if memory serves descended upon Tommy and hustled him into a paddy wagon and in a matter of minutes you know found guilty bank contempt of court in a prison I think they thought this was going to be the end of it and lo and behold around the world there has been free Tommy protests and in the UK there's been some very vocal protests about freeing Tommy and I think it dawned on them that my goodness instead of shutting down this busybody this motormouth this messenger we're potentially turning him into a martyr and that's nothing to serve the government for its own selfish needs and CP Nationals rights we will never be silenced by our corrupt government good point CP as Ezra said he thinks that Canada's maybe five years ten years behind the UK I mean when you see things like m103 the motion bending Islam and Islam sorry the most can be a Freudian slip there folks the motion banning racism but especially Islamophobia and you see how that's being interpreted in Canada I think this is the proverbial thin edge of the wedge in terms of shutting down the opinions of people who have let's shall we say impolite opinions of certain groups certain faiths so let's watch that and I have a clarification for mr. producer it is actually save Tommy calm for the legal fund so forgive me folks save Tommy calm that is money for Tommy's legal fund there it is there and for Ezra's expenses it is Tommy trial Tom that is Tommy trial calm if you want to contribute to Ezra's expenses that's a completely separate fundraising initiative on behalf of rebel we are not taking money from save Tommy calm every single penny is going towards Tommy's legal defense there and the reason why we need contributions and we need to ask you know rely upon your generous generosity is that it's very expensive to go to London I mean booking a flight in the last minute which was the case in this scenario hotel rooms even cabs it is very expensive and that is why we're relying on the generosity of our viewers and you know what folks who always come through so if you can give anything a buck to $5 it all helps and I just saw a comment from David Canada is not crude get out and protest but we've been covering protests we covered my cameraman Efrain and I we went down to the British Consulate at bay and college last month and there was a group of it was several dozen people and you know again people will say well why aren't there hundreds there well it was a Friday around 1:30 if memory serves so many people are working just trying to you know make ends meet but I'll tell you the people that were there including war veterans who had a lot to say I mean they were very vocal they were very intelligent about their support for Tommy and again like I said here is something that I believe the UK powers-that-be thought would go away on May 25th and instead they have created a monster of Frankenstein e'en proportions let's see see it lost X so much fuss back Tommy it's just a shame so many feels scared to say so and you know you raise a very good point as well as we've brought to your attention on this show previously just imagine not so much in Canada but in the UK nine hundred police officers nine hundred police officers not patrolling the streets not going after rape gangs you know not showing a sense of public security but rather at their desk looking into a computer like this and searching for any kind of what they deem to be irresponsible or hateful tweet or social media posting and they typically find people who are just venting or expressing an opinion that goes contrary to the politically correct polite society of Britain and the next thing you know it's usually three or four in the morning I don't know why they do that other than absolute pure intimidation and scare tactics they're knocking on your door and as lol oh did you send this out on the social media and then you've got some trouble I mean even if you're not found guilty there's an economic penalty because going back to lawyers and legal fees you need a lawyer to defend yourself or you're screwed trust me on that folks and so even if they can't get you by the letter of the law they will economically discipline you for having a contrary opinion and again that is more egregious behavior from a country that is should be all about freedom and rights and Terry wins Stanley rights free Tommy if he has been denied his legal rights in prison that is illegal free Tommy and ban Islam and the Quran and moss in the UK well the ban on Islam and the Quran and moss in the UK that's never going to happen and really nor should it I think you know here's some radicalism for me if you folks how about treating everybody equally under the law how about not showing special treatment and special privileges for certain groups and I think that's what's going on and to your first point about Tommy being denied legal rights again once he gets out and once this is behind them I guess it's up to him to pursue that and once again that's going to be a very costly proposition as they say you know you it's very tough to fight City Hall and let's see now here's an interesting one Mickey monk chunk all Tommy haters are pedophiles well I wouldn't say that and you have to be careful with language like that folks I mean this reminds me of Elon Musk and the Thailand cave rescue for those young soccer players where he had developed this little mini submarine and one of the the experts on site basically said it was really a publicity stunt and Musk tweeted in in response that this fellow was a I think the words were pedo pedo guy you know implying that he's a pedophile to me that's actionable and here we are Elon Musk apologizes for calling ty cave rescuer pedo that's the first step in the right direction for mr. musk because that is certainly an actionable thing and again it comes down to this we don't have to you know resort to ad hominem attacks on those we oppose we just have to state the facts so let us not play that kind of game and real men fish rights if Tommy was a confessed convicted terrorist like Omar Khadr should get them a pass and ten point five million bucks well you know I hope we're kind conflating two separate issues here but I really I'm really glad real men fish that you bring this up lettuce this this payment to Kotter was made last summer if I believe last July I think and let us always keep this top of mind because next year of course is Anna let is on a federal election for Canada and we shouldn't forget about these kind of payments and other payments to people like Omar Khadr who is a convicted terrorist and don't forget not just a payment but a public apology can't remember this can anyone remember if Trudeau cried for that one I know he cries when he gives apologies to natives and to gays and cried meeting a Broadway you know cast of a play backstage I have no idea why he cried there he cried when he was given a photograph of his father did he cry at that apology too and I'm always still so miffed that the extensible reason that the liberals say they gave that big juicy cheque of 10.5 million was the fact that well you know to fight this in court it would be you know in the tens of millions maybe even the hundreds of millions and and perhaps we're gonna lose you know it's funny folks isn't it when it comes to Omar Khadr that the Liberals the tax-and-spend liberals suddenly become fiscal conservatives with our money suddenly they're worried about the bottom line and the the budget the deficit and doing the right thing financially so yeah I'm sorry I don't buy that and I would say this being a fiscal conservative myself that even if this was a fool's errand I think on a matter of principle they should have fought that hammer and tong this idea of giving that rat that sewer rat any compensation by the way am I gonna get condemned for calling Omar Khadr sewer rat I know you know if Desmond Cole's tuning in he didn't like it when Mayor John Tory referred to a couple of gangbangers as sewer rats when they shot at some little girls on a playground sewer rats have feelings too so to the sewer rat community out there I imagine I owe you an apology and I owe you one but you're not going to get it and let's see oh I'm having some you know technical difficulties maybe one of my mr. producers will come in and oh no it's it's bad it's working again it's just me folks by the way I refer to my crew now is mr. producer because they know what their names being used and they don't want their extracurricular activities being talked about I think we have a bunch of people at the rebel dot media that are in the witness protection program folks I mean I'm even in the phone book I don't know what these guys are afraid of I only use their first name too but things seem to be working so let's find something else to talk about on Tommy if I can and I think I saw something up here since works says sewer rat is acceptable okay you have redeemed yourself since works and real men fish against is also going into the next election let's not forget sergeant spear and his widow and children indeed you know remember one of the guys putting him back together losing his life for him as well and we have a super chat from Andy two pounds thank you so much for your generosity and E and Sadiq Khan baby balloon to fly every day over Luton now is is that an actual statement of fact Andy or is that something you hope for it's something I hope for and and therefore I do hope it's a statement of fact but if you have something recent on that crowdfunder for the Sadiq Khan balloon and there it is this never gets old and you know I hope it's that big because judging by the the perspective that would make the Sadiq Khan baby balloon about five times bigger than the so-called gigantic Donald Trump balloon which was actually between something like 15 and 21 tall you know about bouncy castle size and let us see what we have here and mmm Michael Sephiroth hope I pronounce your name correctly Michael what are the facts behind moving Tommy from the initial prison to a fully Muslim and grooming gang member inmates great question and when Ezra continues his reporting maybe that will come up in the trial maybe it won't I would say again this is the state using its power of intimidation I can't think of any good reason like I said it's not as though Tommy is a risk to society Society or anyone else for that matter and oh we got another a super chat I believe let me just try to okay from Nigel two pounds again thank you again Nigel for your generosity you are cursed if you say Jesus is God's Son and that is according to the Quran you know what I don't know if that is a line or not from the Quran I'll have to look into it it would it's kind of funny though because I know in Islam Jesus is indeed a revered prophet so could be true couldn't I don't know and we have from Wayne McLaughlin at Bob Xebec oh we don't all put up with Justin Trudeau a large portion of Canadians despises Justin Trudeau Trudeau yeah I I can't fault you there from what I've seen there is a huge block of people that don't like what Trudeau and the Liberals are doing I'm more worried folks about apathy going into the next election that is people that are still looking at the issues based on optics as opposed to the facts and those people that still buy in well you know he's a good-looking guys got nice hair great abs and they're really not drilling down any deeper than that that's what really scares me about the chances of this regime being reelected again it's a possibility you know who knows but you know I've always agreed with Ezra's take on what happened in the last federal election and I think this you know speaks to some hope for those who support regime change in Ottawa and that is it wasn't so much the Liberals doing outstandingly well or the conservatives doing outstandingly bad but it was about the NDP cratering in the province of Quebec remember going back to Elections ago the NDP had stunning gains and I think one of the big reasons they cratered in Quebec was a fatal fall flaw by their former leader Thomas Mulcair who as you recall he went to bat for that woman in Mississauga who was trying to get her citizenship sworn in wearing the niqab the full face concealing Islamic garment and that doesn't play all that well in Quebec remember going back last year go back past the so-called anti facemask bill and this was by a liberal government in Quebec so I think Mulcair died on this issue I guess he's sticking to his principles I don't know what principle he's standing up for in terms of a you know advocating that somebody wears a facial disguise in public especially at a citizenship swearing-in but he did stick to his principle and he paid the price and you know what we're paying the price now we have the Justin Trudeau liberals who are proving with every passing month that they remain the not-ready-for-prime-time players and like I said let's see if what happens in battleground Quebec come the next election and you know it is one thing you can say about Quebec basically on any election is that it is an incredibly fickle province they swing back and forth so let's see what else we have I think we might have another super chat help needed five pounds thank you for the five pound donation helpmeet it can Tommy go into politics with his record for me he should be a Gration minister Oh can you imagine you know I I don't know what the rules are in the UK if a criminal conviction precludes you from running I don't think it would I guess if you've served your time you've paid your debt to society I don't think it would but Tommy has had his experience in politics I don't think from when I've spoken to him it's what he wants to do in the future it might be wrong about that maybe things change I think he likes being a commentator I think he likes doing the social media thing of calling BS of what's happening in his country and maybe he's getting more attention that way and certainly that would be the case right now thanks to his incarceration certainly his story his issue is getting out there and so I think we've pretty much covered off the the the Tommy trial for now folks if you want the most recent updates please go into azrael events twitter feed he's got all the latest and as of now just to recap if you just joined us late the court is out for the day across the pond and the Chief Justice says that they have a complicated task before them and that they hope to complete this task before the end of July and as is recessed that seems excessively slow and you think they'd at least grant Tommy bail in the meantime I agree I don't think Tommy's a risk and especially since it's come out in the court about how shoddy his treatment has been in prison that would be a way of making amends don't you think so what else do we have well Trudeau came up in our discussion and just announced maybe two hours ago this morning there's a bit of a cabinet shuffle Trudeau is realigning the deck I guess it's in advance of going into the election for next year and and look who we have we have Bill Blair an MP who was not a cabinet minister and they've created a new position for him by the way I should say that it's not really much of a shuffle all the senior Cabinet ministers remain you know Morneau free Lynne Suzanne Bryson they're all there but Bill Blair is now get this the he has the newly-created role of Minister of border security and organized crime reduction and maybe that's saying the same thing with different words given who's coming over the border these days I gotta tell you folks this doesn't fill my sails with optimism I'm not a big Bill Blair fan going back to when he was the chief of police in Toronto and I'll tell you why I think it was I'm going by memory here and I'm only going to be paraphrasing not using direct quotes but I remember Bill Blair having a press conference as the chief of police and I believe the press conference was about the sentencing coming up for a criminal who had killed a Toronto police officer all on-duty and what got my spidey senses tingling greatly was when Bill Blair said words the effect of we can't just be concerned about the pursuit of justice we have to be concerned about social justice as well and I went no you're the Chief of Police of the largest police force in the country you're about law and order you're about preventing crime what are you talking about social justice this is the kind of crapola we hear on the campuses of U of and Ryerson you know and other bastions of social justice warrior ISM to hear the Chief of Police speak like this so he played his cards I think with that one statement and suddenly Bill Blair who has a soft spot for social justice whatever that means and if anyone can offer a definition I would love to hear it he's now in the newly created role of Minister of border security and organized crime reduction are you happy about that folks please lay in a way in and I shall get to your comments and a super tweet here from steep six five dollars thank you very much for that no comment though so I'll just say thank you so much for the five bucks I do appreciate it and let's see go on so anyways if you'd like to weigh in on the Trudeau cabinet shuffle and your opinions of Bill Blair in this what should be an important role please have your say it should also be noted that one of my mister producers whose name I cannot say pointed out to me because he has an eagle eye that with the shake-up in the cabinet it is now 18 men and 17 woman Oh Oh what happened to the 50/50 split and why is it that if it's an odd number it's automatically a male MP I mean remember Justin Trudeau when he was asked about this the 50/50 gender quota cabinet it's because it's 2015 well I guess because it's 2018 the 2015 rules don't apply and you know what else really irked me about that when you think about it folks if you're simply you know making the cabinet up based on gender well maybe there's so much female talent there that they should actually be more than 50 percent of the cap ministers so in a way sticking to that 50/50 split to begin with could have been discriminatory against females who's to say so yeah so much for the gender equity at cabinet I guess well to bring that up to him on the the campaign trail and so let's see what okay then bear with me okay I guess we're getting more comments about Tommy strong Exorcist says the punishment doesn't fit the crime even if there was a crime Tommy is a political prisoner well you know strong Exorcist I agree with you there and if the crime was indeed contempt of court I think what Ezra has done on so many occasions in this space has shown that the precedents for contempt of court and we're talking about repeat violators nobody got 13 months in jail nobody I mean it is so over the line all right and we have mr. producer number one tells me we have two super chats and I'm struggling to find them and maybe we can have one of the trained broadcast professionals come in because as you know my feeling about machines folks is they are out to screw you so that's kind of frozen up in the meantime anyways welcome more thoughts on Tommy and more of your opinions on the cabinet shuffle which is no longer a gender equity cabinet anymore and from Eric heaps and not one solicitor will defend him this is how deep it goes well you know he does have a good lawyer but you're quite right Ezra has outlined in the past that when we started shopping for lawyers how how tough this was to get good legal talent to represent Tommy Robinson and these weren't lepers these were guys getting you know a thousand pounds an hour but it was too much of a political hot potato for them to take on I mean they wouldn't tell us that they would say some kind of legalese gobbledygook and so that again leads me to believe that he is a political prisoner at the end of the day and thanks to my trained broadcast professional that came in while you were looking at these Tommy graphic there I can now read the two super chats and from nigel again two pounds Thank You Nigel free jeremy member now 33 years of injustice I will have to research that Nigel to give you an informed opinion if that is possible and from Bob Bartos $2 thank you Bob Canada sucks again thanks Justin well you know what you can always get your make Canada great again caps we we sell those here at the rebel and whenever we have a rebel live event it is so nice to see those red make Canada great again caps in the audience because Canada shouldn't suck and it doesn't deserve to suck this is the greatest country in the world despite who's in the seat of power in Ottawa right now and let's go on Jason chard Lowe says Tommy does not deserve jail and I would agree with you that even if he is in contempt of court he certainly doesn't deserve 13 months based on precedent in the UK that is overkill and doesn't do that and yeah it looks like it's it's all Tommy all the time no one wants to talk about the the cabinet shuffle aside from pke racing a junkie Ottawa is a city of leeches yeah I suppose that is where so many of our tax dollars end up but it always goes to good endeavours doesn't it folks like ten point five million dollars to a convicted terrorist and okay David Jeffrey spec says laughing out loud 17 verses 89 or Mele would comment but since it is Trudeau being attacked I'll just sit back and laugh Menzies and laughs you should because he is being what's that phrase again hoisted on his own petard I hope you know what a an upcoming press conference that he's taken to task on this non fifty-fifty split anymore and don't let him off with well it's an odd number we really should push for the that extra MP to be female wouldn't that be part of Justin and his feminist ideology coming to the fore and all right all right so moving right along what else do we have here okay let's lighten it up a little bit if that's possible have you heard about a supermodel her name is Mara Martin well you probably haven't heard about her until today and we're gonna run a clip which will show why suddenly everybody in the world it seems at least in the fashion business is talking about her let's let's check that out mara Martin she's the swimsuit model creating a big splash for breastfeeding her baby on the runway 30 year old Mara Martin rocked a metallic gold bikini in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit runway show in Miami but getting just as much attention is her five-month-old daughter aria nursing while wearing headphones to protect her little ears from the loud music and look she's wearing her own little bikini bottoms over her diaper magazine editor MJ de told The Today Show that it wasn't planned to go like this mara was holding her baby and was nursing her I was like she wanted just nurse when you walked down the runway she was like I would love to do that take me back to that moment when you step out the magazine editor came over to me and said if you want to continue feeding your baby and walk down the runway I completely support you social media reaction was Swift and mostly supportive love this mothers are super women and that should be celebrated you know I'm not one of these guys folks that gets upset when a a woman is breastfeeding in public and you know sometimes nature calls and in a restaurant or at a shopping mall and I I have absolutely zero problem with that but why do I get the idea that we're being gamed here that this was really an elaborate publicity stunt I mean I'm reading the newspaper story in the Sun and Mara says she was pleased to receive so many positive comments but she questioned why her actions were deemed as newsworthy um well I think it's because if you're a supermodel and your job is to spend a couple of minutes strutting onstage surely there was some other time in which you could have breastfed your baby I mean the idea that this just organically came about that oh I have to do my strutting of my gold bikini and jr. needs feeding right now what a unfortunate coincidence oh no I'm not buying that in fact I think it kind of belittles the whole idea of a mother breastfeeding her child it's almost as though she was holding this baby as I don't know a Chanel bag look at my latest accessory yes it's a designer baby that came out of my womb isn't she beautiful by the way IIIi can't you know you saw that clip folks they were doing some fuzzy blue dot effect on her rear end but she is prepared query if I'm right or wrong guys she she was wearing bottoms right yeah okay yeah so I I don't know why that blue dot was there anyways and that was the back not the not the front so I you know it kind of reminds me of I can't remember her name was a liberal MP I believe in the House of Commons that brought her child to a vote and breastfed her there like I said not against here we are Carina Gould applauded for breastfeeding son and House of Commons now the thing is wouldn't you think that there's like a quiet place for that or wouldn't you think that maybe on this day the husband or the father could take care of the child or maybe the nanny or that there could be some other kind of arrangement again I think this is a stunt essentially to you know say to everybody look at me look at me I'm breastfeeding in public so so take that and again I think the vast majority of people are not against anyone breastfeeding in public every I don't know year two years there's always some story of somebody losing their stuff in a restaurant because you know a woman had the temerity to discreetly breastfeed her child but I think for the for most of us that's not the case but this this come on this is a publicity stunt and I would love to see what you have to say about this as well we have some super chats folks so we have one here from Elaine Finn $15 but no comment well Elaine please weigh in but thank you so much for your generous donation greatly appreciate that and and mr. producer number one is saying there is one above that in green you know I'm telling you when they come out here this computer doesn't freeze but it is freezing right now or maybe it's not registering any body heat from my fingers maybe I'm in a stage of zombification because this mouse is not moving along and I'm so sorry to bore you with my technical difficulties folks click in the window okay I am doing that mr. producer and a Bowie oh here we go okay - alright it is working again okay so from John singers I I hope I pronounced your name right John donation of two dollars thank you so much for that OLG scribbled on your ticket and then blamed you nuts wow that that's completely off-topic but I'm happy to discuss this yeah I had an incredible thing happened to me I think it's going back to last year and it was about the olg which is the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and I was trying to claim a winning lottery ticket it wasn't a jackpot of Laurel max proportions by any means it was actually about eleven hundred dollars and the way the rules are in Ontario if you're claiming a lottery win of over a thousand you have to go through the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation otherwise you can get a retailer to pay you up to 999 dot $0.99 so I go in there first of all I couldn't remember the precise retail location where I bought the ticket I told them it was the town of Richmond Hill which turned out to be right and despite the fact that I think there's over 400 municipalities and in Theriault low and behold I did get the right municipality for them that wasn't good enough for the interior Lottery and Gaming Corporation so what they did is not only folks did they not pay me my $1,100 I had to they sorry they confiscated the winning ticket as well now this is my property this is my possession in law possession is nine-tenths of the law and but according to OLG regulations that is apparently above the law and what this individual is referring to here about the the OLG scribbling on my ticket I actually had to file I'm not making this up I had to file a small claims lawsuit to get my money back money of a winning ticket that I legit him and what came up as evidence is that the ticket was defaced with scribbles and actually it was more than just scribbles it was black magic marker lines that were drawn through all of the ticket but here's the thing folks not a single you know micron of ink came from my pen or my marker it was all the Oh LG's doing and I could prove that by their own surveillance camera footage which showed that I gave them a clean ticket that was completely unmarked I guess you know just to wrap this story the oil G as you may know going back almost ten years it was the recipient of the most scathing report ever from provincial um buds Minh in terms of corruption in terms of fraud in terms of looking the other way when they came across corruption and fraud and my experience is this government monopoly which is only answerable to itself is still acting in this kind of fashion okay then right then and so but thank you for remembering that because you got my blood boiling again okay oops and I'm being told by mr. producer that there is a and mr. producer you are gonna have to come back into this studio because okay then so the the statement is Tommy Robinson is Australia's champion too and that's a super chat from steep six and steep six I want to thank you for your contribution and yeah Tommy Robinson I would argue should be a champion for every Western democracy in fact Tommy Robinson should be a champion for anyone anywhere in the world that cares about free speech and freedom of expression and freedom of the press and all the other freedoms that we take for granted freedoms that are steadily being chipped away at especially in a country like the UK and I really hope as were as wrong that you know Canada is you know ten years away from UK draconian ISM but I don't think he is unless we take a sense shoe more at the bottom I'm told and mr. producer the computer is completely frozen so I'm gonna have to depend on you to come in here oh boy I'm getting that stink eye I swear folks the computer is completely frozen in a way I've never seen it before well I'll see if we have any chats on the breast feeding on the catwalk story of Mara Martin in the meantime I found this an interesting story yesterday the Conservative Party pulled an attack ad depicting a black man illegally crossing the border I don't know if you came across this story folks it was an attack ad and it showed it was it was all about the porous border that we have in Canada today and evidently because the the individual crossing the border illegally was black therefore that made this racist and I don't understand why I mean were they supposed to use a white person to avoid the charges of racism and when you look at a lot of the people that are crossing the border oh I don't know Haitians Nigerians we're talking about countries that are indeed predominantly black so you know what is the issue and I'm sorry to report that the Conservatives caved and Russia R well he did it again he decided that he was going to capitulate rather than make the case and that this was completely fine and but or is it I mean are these the new rules when it comes to diversity is our strength except when it isn't that if you are ever showing someone committing an illicit or illegal act you cannot show somebody of color that it has to be I suppose a white person is this maybe more penance for those of us with this kind of complexion for our supposed white privilege and white supremacy and all that other stuff that the liberal left fires back in us so again I by the way the what the the tweet showed what the ad showed was that the black man was carrying a suitcase walking over a tweet from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau the tweet is rolled out as a carpet entering a broken fence and the words faith and diversity are visible you know to be quite frank I think that's quite clever and I don't think the and I don't know do we have mr. producer number two number three do we have a image of that tweet that we can put up because maybe it's taken down and expunged from history once and for all but well we'll see if we can get that for you but again why is it necessarily racist just because the person being shown is black I don't get that it's it's again the sewer rat analogy when Mayor John Tory called those two gangbanger shooting at two little girls in the playground soon rats and Desmond cold basically charging John Tory with racism because you know Yorick waiting black people to sewer rats well the fact of the matter the the joke was on Desmond Cole Merrit or II didn't even know the race of the shooters at the time but again sewer rats have feelings from flat dark earth I don't know if that's the earth or earth but we'll go with our $10 thank you so much for that love rebel media honest question why do you disparage Millennials when you are more economically conservative than boomers or sorry when they are more economically conservative than boomers I'd rather have someone in forced gay marriage than a twenty trillion dollar debt well you know what it would indeed be wrong to judge a group on mass by the actions of a percentage but it just seems to me and I mean like you know when we when we look upon stories that emanate from the press regardless of their political stripes so much is about Millennials are upset about this or Millennials are upset about that I mean one that comes to mind is you know Millennials are triggered by friends do you remember that story was from a UK newspaper and they thought that some of the themes that were in friends which to me is one of the most innocuous sitcoms ever I mean what's the get upset about but they would said it was there was homophobia sexism transphobia and so there's always these trigger points and so we call them as we see them and I have to say too that a lot of Millennials will weigh in in the comments section and they'll say I'm a millennial oh god please don't lump me in with the rest of this brethren I'm not part of that so good for you but for some reason this particular generation seems more sensitive more triggered than though before it and those after it I might be wrong but this is what I'm interpreting by the stories that are out there and we have a very generous super chat for twenty two dollars or twenty two Norwegian kroner Wow what do you think that that works out to in Canadian dollars Norwegian kroner from copa de ZOA I hope I pronounced your name right Copa I think Copas right um and the chat is this better be careful make the men geez the MacBook anybody you know what I wouldn't be surprised I think it's the other way around my friend Copa I think I'm about to bite this MacBook it's frustrating me to know and I don't know how Azra can so dutifully multitasks the way he does and he'll be back on Friday by the way you only have one more day of me putting up with technical difficulties so anyways I see it is working again and why don't we check out what's being said from David K TV er Rempel has a social media presence shear doesn't exist outside of the Parliament lunchroom you know I'm a fan of Rand Paul I sure hope Shearer picks up his game and I mean the clock is ticking but this capitulation yesterday over a tweet being condemned as racist when I don't see the races a minute it's just it's more spinelessness let's call it as we see it a folks so let's see what happens in the weeks and months to come and let's see love rosco wealthy white neighborhoods even if they're black or hispanic that's right not sure what that means but if you can fill me in I'm happy to flesh that out that's going on today ok David Jeff spec again rates a lot of people who you might think opposed the globalists at the same time are promoting globalist lies use the create war and divide people need to wake up well one step at a time let's wake up next year and have regime change in Ottawa that's for sure and from Tammy again we have Bernie a should not have been kicked out Shearer is a big baby well I agree I think it's tragic what happened with Bernie a and let's not forget going back to the leadership convention what were we talking about I think it went to the thirteenth ballot between Bernie and Shearer and we were talking about less than a percent in terms of the margin of victory and I really wonder folks how things would have been different with Bernie a insurers position I think it would have been for the better you know I know I've talked about that with Sheila gun Reid she thinks so too and but it's a hypothetical question and sheer will get his chance next year but like I said please and you pick up your game already I mean I think there's been so many full pause by this government so many Fiasco's that these are law balls coming over home plate just waiting to be hit out of the ballpark and the guy is a WOL I I don't get it if you want to be Prime Minister this is not the approach to take and lupus rights the plot to flood Europe with 200 million africa's africans by 2050 well you know what i don't know if that is a plot but certainly in terms of demographics there are I guess millions of migrants in the European continent right now if you added up all the countries and then you just let I guess demographics do their stuff in terms of birth rates and slowly but surely you will see the profile of these nations change and it's disturbing and again I guess just for speaking about that that's a measure of racism see love Roscoe says the government supports welfare state calafate sneakers and illegals to collapse Nations it's just that simple if you don't think they believe their own rhetoric do you ha ha ha they all live in and you know what it is costing us right now the cost and it's increasing on a daily basis for Ontario alone putting up with migrants is a hundred and seventy four million and as we discussed yesterday a lot of those migrants are in hockey rinks that are out of service they're in student dormitories that are out of service at least until the day after Labor Day and the question arises what happens when September comes and hockey players want to play hockey and students want to reside on campus this is a real mess folks and from observer dude five pounds thank you so much observer dude for your generosity few months ago I nearly got kicked out of a pub just for mentioning Tommy Robinson the owner threatened to kick me out they got triggered so easily you know again this is really a despicable new trend we talked about this yesterday with people with mega hats for example or talking conservative politics getting into uber rides and the driver just saying get out of the car and now here you observe a dude getting out of a pub just for you know and I'm assuming you were just talking about your having support for Tom Robinson you weren't you know creating a commotion or a disturbance I think that is despicable that you'd be kicked out of a pub for doing that and you know if you can we're almost out of time I see where you know right at the finish line folks but it was over dude if you can communicate tomorrow about the details of what led to you being kicked out and what the other pub patrons were saying when this happened I would love to read that I would love to know more about your story well folks that is it for Wednesday July 18th 2018 thank you so much for tuning in to battleground I'll be here tomorrow Ezra's back on Friday and never forget without risk there could be no glory good afternoon you
