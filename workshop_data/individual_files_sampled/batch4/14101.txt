hello lesbian Bieber checking in with the rebel media I'm here today because I'm going to be going to a doctor's clinic to see if I can be diagnosed as a man I don't know if you'll work I've got a pretty good getup in my opinion and because gender is on a spectrum I mean unless they're massive bigots they'll have to give me the diagnosis Ezra has already given me some excellent tips things to say pals before gals let's get up may I have my license milady thanks for the tip sizer I'm sure they'll be super helpful let's go see if this works I don't mean to waste your time at all but I've been a gender non-binary person for about a year now so I've used I've used male pronouns and among my friends groups as Oliver can tell you I've been identified as a male for a while I don't always present as male but gender is a spectrum so and unfortunately right now before Trudeau's law goes through in order to get your identity card when you go into bars and everything you have to have a doctor's note to have your proper gender on there it's gonna be changing in the next two years we won't have to have a doctor's note so I just need a doctor's note that says I can I'm able to get my proper gender identification able to get you so when I go to get my driver's license so when I go into bars and stuff people don't misgender me I just want to be able to have male on my gender identification on my driver's license card but I need a doctor's know what to do that they're changing it in the next two years so you don't they don't have to identify a female or male yeah no no I use male pronouns on of my friends yeah so he doesn't have to identify his female on his official government documentation Oh give me the benefit of the doubt I mean he's hot can prove anything right yeah obviously thank you so this is - they just sent down to use that male identification this is - when did you start using the male about a year ago so any particular reason that the sudden change in the past year I feel that my gender is a more masculine gender I don't always present as masculine but inside gender is a spectrum it's different how you present it's different how you feel and I've always felt more masculine I'm I'm attracted to girls I've always been more math so it's always been is well it's not like it's something from knowledge it's they didn't uh yep it's been a long time my whole life okay do you want me to say that you should be identified as a man yes please okay I am in absolute shock right now I am now medically diagnosed as a male this is astonishing to me I mean it's quite clear that my hair is just up in a hat but I guess that's all it takes to get your diagnosis so I already a better I say you know I think I'm getting paid more you know I I'm stronger I feel more privileged this is great being a man is great but I need one last thing to be a real man I need to legally be a man so we're gonna go and see if I can get my government ID change to mail hi I'd like to get my Ontario ID card out for it no I just moved here a month ago I've got my old BC license sherry CH year ie good sure one more thing for purposes of this identification I would like to be identified as male I brought in all of the proper documents yep firstly I've read every fortnight you walk the cards number thank you excellent thank you so much okay so as of today I now have a doctor's confirmation that I should be identified as a male and legal confirmation that I am indeed a dude I honestly didn't expect it to be that easy and you know what some people might be wondering like what's the big deal so what if people can just change their gender whenever they want how does that impact me how does it impact society well I'll tell you how it negatively impact society it makes us as a whole give up our sense of honesty objectivity and our respect for facts I mean we've gotten to this point of toxic hetain ism where we've decided that we prefer feelings over objective honesty we've decided that we prefer to be what do whatever makes us feel good rather than acknowledge the reality of situations I showed up to get my government ID wearing makeup I had my hair down I was wearing high heels I was talking like a chick when I was there but when I said I want to be a male the government worker played into my delusions because she doesn't want to get fired and in fact if Bill c16 goes through Trudeau's new bill on transgender rights LGBTQ things people could literally go to jail for denying someone's gender identity no matter what they present as no matter if they have a doctor's note or anything you could go to jail that is insane today you can go into a doctor's office and this is even before bill C 16 has gone through and it'll take you one hour not even to intimidate a doctor into giving you whatever identification you want we're embracing calling professors they we're considering making it illegal to question people's ridiculous pronouns how far can this go society is going to come to a crossroad at some point are we going to embrace reality or fiction thanks for watching if you enjoyed that video then be sure to hit the subscribe button to check out more content Oh women you told me all right my fellow dudes
