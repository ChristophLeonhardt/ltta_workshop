hey Michael who do you think will outlast the other do you think Trump will make it to eight years or will the media and the left succeed in pushing about well it seems like they really want to impeach the guy they've been trying to lose he joked about that yesterday yeah they all really want to impeach the guy I think he's gonna stick it out I I think the the one thing you can never say with Trump is never which is ironic because there is all movement called never Trump the guy seems to outfox his opponents in every step of the way the other reason why I think he'll outlast them is that the American people like him he's very popular right now his approval rating has consistently been on par with Obama's at this point in his presidency or higher we know that approval of his presidency especially among Millennials especially among racial minorities has surged in just the last five months we know just among black men it doubled overnight and actually even more than doubled because the mixed feelings percentage also rose significantly so I think he's doing very well on that front obviously the the facts of his presidency are all looking good the economy is doing well we're seeing good diplomacy freed hostages on and on and on this also shows that successful presidencies shape public opinion so look the the left and the Democrats and the resistance and all the screaming people and the pink cats who say no you know all of those people still want to impeach him I say let them try because if they succeed if they manage to impeach him you could probably see what happened to Nixon in 1974 Nixon was elected in 1972 with 49 states he a 49 states he lost one state in just a few electoral votes that he lost they finally booted a man of office like they wanted to what happened the next big election we got Ronald Reagan we got 28 years of basically conservative governance so the mainstream media the Democratic Party bureaucrats make all they want they can try to overturn a presidential election the people still have a say and I think that they will make their voice heard okay it'll be interesting especially with the midterms coming out the the data from the midterms are incredible because historically he should lose the house if not the house and the Senate most sitting presidents do lose midterm elections they that's just the historical record and yet the number that we're seeing a lot of people now are saying hold off on this blue wave a lot of Democratic strategists are saying this blue wave might not be as nice as we thought if some people are saying we could pick up seats in the Senate if we managed not to lose the house which we should lose the house historically speaking if we managed not to that would be a massive mandate to govern it would be unexpected except by all the people who expected it
