coming out of school getting a good job what you're describing working your way up buying a house those are all parts of the American Dream and all of those things in different ways have gotten harder it seems is that American dream still available to as many people now as it has been in the past I think if you look at what happened a little bit you know so we have the best country on the planet and we have schools and universities and food water energy peaceful neighbors low corruption you name it best from lies Cuba's capital markets that doesn't we should identify problems you know we don't have divine right to success and so if you look at it what would the problem one is middle-class wages haven't gone up one is that low wages haven't up enough to create a living wage one is you know people losing jobs from you know more for automation than anything else but again with the exclusion its retraining its relocation is income assistance it's things that actually take place so we're just trying to recognize those things that we we've left some people behind and we haven't done a pretty good job fixing it so my own view this is not a political issue it's not a knee-jerk reaction either side it's training schools getting growth going again you know Detroit would be a great example and if you look at Detroit that mayor you know the pot it's been a train wreck for 40 years the population has gone from over two million to seven thousand but this mayor come in and he talked about streetlights sanitation jobs policing schools affordable housing he's doing it all and starting to go for the first time in thirty years because literally one man but that one man couldn't have done without business and you got wonderful people in Detroit like Dan Gilbert JPMorgan Chase and business could have done it without the political environment where they want to improve things if you got an anti business environment there it still will be going down in terms of the lost generation that can lead to frustration and you referred earlier to some of the anger upstairs towards the global elite can you just talk about how you see that effective a list I kind of agree with it that you know when you leave people behind and those people who are left behind it's not really because their own fault they're saying it was the leaders of institutions you're always gonna have a leak and you can have elite in the common society if you leave but it is the leaders something went wrong and collectively the leaders are responsible and so you know and there's some other terrible you know men 25 to 55 labor force participation is down 10% that's unbelievable 35,000 diet opioids every year 70% of kids 17 to 24 can't get to the US military because of health or education think of obesity diabetes reading and writing is that is that something is that the society wanted so no we should be working these things acknowledged applause we haven't come up with solutions not Democrat not Republican not need your solutions and any jobs a good job so I this whole concept of their dead end up is not true and I've heard it my whole life you know dead-end jobs but you know a lot of those burger flippers end up owning and running restaurants it's the first rung jobs lead to dignity if you're good at the first you get to the second jobs lead to household formation jobs are better solutions for society and I think the other probably have like expanded Earned Income Tax Credit which can help the lower the lower page have more of a living wage which will you know lead them to do more in a little help small business won't help bigger companies but we should be doing things like that
