1
00:00:00,485 --> 00:00:01,886
ASSUME THAT IF THEY LIKE A MOVIE

2
00:00:01,887 --> 00:00:04,488
OR SONG THAT THE PERSON WHO MADE

3
00:00:04,489 --> 00:00:05,756
IT PROBABLY DOESN'T LIKE THEIR

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,695
MUCH FROM THE LEFT COAST.

5
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:11,696
ROSEANNE BARR BREAKS DOWN IN

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,335
REVIVAL OF HER SHOW AFTER THIS

7
00:00:17,336 --> 00:00:19,303
TWEET AND THAT VALERIE JARRETT

8
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:21,138
WAS VIEWED AS OVERTLY RACIST.

9
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:23,207
>> I HORRIBLY REGRET THAT.

10
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,309
ARE YOU KIDDING?

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:25,976
I'VE LOST EVERYTHING.

12
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:27,778
I REGRETTED IT BEFORE I LOST

13
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,780
EVERYTHING.

14
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:34,352
I SAID TO GOD, I AM WILLING TO

15
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:37,888
HAVE DONE WRONG.

16
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:40,558
>> Shannon: JOINING US NOW,

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,760
AMERICA'S RABBI AND LONGTIME

00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:43,794
ROSEANNE FRIEND, RABBI SHMULEY

19
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:44,128
BOTEACH.

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,663
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US

22
00:00:45,997 --> 00:00:48,466
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

23
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:50,201
>> Shannon: SHE WAS VERY

24
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:56,207
ALSO AND SAID SHE KNOWS SHE WILL

25
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,675
HAVE A PRICE TO PAY.

26
00:00:57,676 --> 00:00:59,677
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

27
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:00,811
COMMENTING ON THE DEATH OF

28
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:01,645
STABILITY IN AMERICA BUT MAY BE

29
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:03,681
MORE CONSEQUENTIAL AS THE DEATH

30
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:04,415
OF FORGIVENESS.

31
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,683
HERE YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO     WO

32
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:05,716
HERE YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO     WH

33
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:06,217
HERE YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO     WS

34
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:08,619
QUITE WELL KNOWN AND PREPARED TO

35
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:16,560
BROKENNESS AND ALMOST BEGGING TO

36
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:17,661
BE FORGIVEN FOR SOMETHING THAT

37
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:29,240
ALLOWED HER TO MAKE RESTITUTION

38
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:31,709
AND RECTIFICATION FOR WHAT SHE

39
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,345
DID, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE

40
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:35,312
FORGIVING PEOPLE.

41
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:36,313
AND IT WAS MARTIN LUTHER KING

42
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:39,517
WHO SAID SHE SAYS AS HER IDOL IN

43
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:41,118
THIS PODCAST AND SAYS THOSE THAT

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,721
ARE BEREFT OF FORGIVENESS ARE

45
00:01:43,722 --> 00:01:44,522
BEREFT OF LOVE.

46
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:47,958
>> SHE TALKS ABOUT HOW SHE HAS

47
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,926
AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN AND

48
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:50,461
HER FAMILY AND FAMILY MEMBERS,

49
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:53,497
AND THAT SHE'S NOT A RACIST.

50
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:57,635
SHE SAID SHE WASN'T THINKING OF

51
00:01:57,636 --> 00:01:58,335
VALERIE JARRETT IN THOSE TERMS

52
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:02,773
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE

53
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:03,207
EXPLANATIONS?

54
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,876
>> I'VE KNOWN ROSEANN FOR ALMOST

55
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:08,245
TWO DECADES AND I'VE NEVER HEARD

56
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:11,182
HER UTTER ONE IOTA OF RACISM OR

57
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:12,583
A SCINTILLA OF BIGOTRY.

58
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:14,785
WE ALL KNOW THAT ROSEANN DOES

59
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:17,588
THINGS WITH ELBOWS THAT COULD

60
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:19,790
UPSET PEOPLE BUT I'VE NEVER

61
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,459
HEARD REAL PREJUDICE OR BIGOTRY.

62
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,161
IF YOU HAVE TO PUT THINGS IN

63
00:02:24,162 --> 00:02:24,795
CONTEXT.

64
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:26,397
WHAT SHOCKS ME IS, WE RECORDED

65
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:28,199
THIS ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND WE

66
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
DID NOT RELEASE IT BECAUSE I

67
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:31,569
FELT SHE NEEDED TO REFLECT ON

68
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,805
WHAT SHE HAD SAID WAS VERY

69
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:35,573
VULNERABLE AND VERY VULNERABLE

70
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:37,241
AND SHE HAD TO BE COMFORTABLE

71
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:40,544
THAT IT COULD BE RELEASED.

72
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:42,513
AND IT'S MADE A VERY BIG IMPACT

73
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:44,415
BECAUSE I THINK THE MORAL

74
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,217
COURAGE SHE SHOWED TO TAKE FULL

75
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:51,222
EXPLANATIONS AS TO WHAT HAPPENS

76
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:53,123
BUT NOT EXCUSES AS TO WHAT

77
00:02:53,124 --> 00:02:54,225
HAPPENED.

78
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:59,497
SHE HAS PAID A HUGE PRICE.

79
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:00,297
SHE GAINED NOTHING BY RELEASING

80
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:03,667
THIS INTERVIEW BECAUSE HER SHOW

81
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:05,836
WAS ALREADY CANCELED.

82
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,407
WAS SOMETHING CALLED THE

83
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:20,784
SO SHE IS KEEPING THE MAIN

84
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:22,786
STAYING, AND SHE WANTED TO

85
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:23,954
ASSERT HER VALUES THAT ALL

86
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,656
PEOPLE ARE CREATED IN THE IMAGE

87
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:27,858
OF GOD AS THE BOOK OF GENESIS

88
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:28,993
SAYS IN THE VERY FIRST CHAPTER.

89
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:32,663
>> I KNOW SHE TALKS ABOUT

90
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:34,164
REPENTANCE, REMORSE AND

91
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:34,598
RECOMPENSE.

92
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,202
WE'VE ALL PROBABLY BEEN THERE AT

93
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:39,737
SOME POINT IN OUR LIVES.

94
00:03:39,738 --> 00:03:42,239
WE WILL WAIT AND SEE IF THIS

95
00:03:42,240 --> 00:00:00,000
INTERVIEW HAS AN IMPACT AND HOW
