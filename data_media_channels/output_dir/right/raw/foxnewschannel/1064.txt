CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:05,554

5
00:00:05,554 --> 00:00:05,921
MUCH.

6
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:06,522

YORK TIMES" REPORTER.

13
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:17,566
SHE SPENT 85 DAYS IN JAIL

14
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:20,069
PROTECTING HER RIGHTS AS A

15
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:21,170
MEMBER OF THE PRESS.

16
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,071
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE?

17
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:23,405
EVERY REPORTER TRIES TO FIND

18
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:24,206
SOURCES TO GIVE THEM

19
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:24,940
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS

20
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,407
GOING ON.

21
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:27,309
AT THIS POINT WE DON'T, IT

22
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:30,079
DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THAT WAS

23
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,415
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

24
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:36,618
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

25
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:37,686
>> MARTHA, MY FRIENDS AND

26
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:38,587
FORMER COLLEAGUES OF THE "NEW

27
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:41,123
YORK TIMES" SAY THAT THIS WAS

28
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:45,461
AN OUTRAGEOUS INVASION OF ALI

29
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:46,795
WATKINS' PRIVACY.

30
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:50,966
THAT THEY SEIZED HER METADATA.

31
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:53,569
IT BASICALLY ERODES THE

32
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:54,803
UNDERSTANDING THAT WAS REACHED

33
00:00:54,803 --> 00:00:56,872
BETWEEN THE PRESS AND ERIC

34
00:00:56,872 --> 00:00:58,140
HOLDER WHEN HE WAS ATTORNEY

35
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,507
GENERAL.

36
00:00:58,507 --> 00:00:59,575
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS

37
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:05,981
THAT IS NOT SO.

38
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:06,582
THAT THEY SCRUPULOUSLY

39
00:01:06,582 --> 00:01:08,150
FOLLOWED THE GUIDELINES AND

40
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,685
THEY DID NOT INVADE HER

41
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:11,687
PRIVACY AND GO AFTER HER

42
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:13,155
METADAY FOR THE HECK OF IT.

43
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:14,289
AND THERE WERE NATIONAL

44
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,457
SECURITY GROUNDS FOR DOING SO.

45
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:16,792
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT THE

46
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:19,061
TRUTH IS IN THIS CASE, BECAUSE

47
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:21,964
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF

48
00:01:21,964 --> 00:01:22,664
NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION

49
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:25,200
WAS COMPROMISED.

50
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,902
I OBVIOUSLY AS A MEMBER OF THE

51
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:29,104
PRESS FEEL STRONGLY THAT SINCE

52
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:30,873
ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS HAS

53
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:32,107
THREATENED US AND THREATENED

54
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:33,909
TO PUT MORE REPORTERS IN JAIL

55
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:40,949
TO STOP LEAKS, ONE HAS TO BE

56
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:41,350
SUSPICIOUS.

57
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,918
IN MY CASE, NO NATIONAL

58
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:44,253
SECURITY INFORMATION WAS

59
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:45,120
COMPROMISED, THE F.B.I. AND

60
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,988
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WERE

61
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:47,556
TRYING TO MAKE A POLITICAL

62
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:47,856
CASE.

63
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:49,658
BUT WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH YET.

64
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:51,860
OR AT LEAST I DON'T TO DRAW A

65
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,629
CONCLUSION IN THIS CASE.

66
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:54,329
>> Martha: JUDITH TALK ABOUT

67
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,698
THE METADATA MATERIAL, WHICH

68
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:58,901
MEANT THEY WERE ABLE TO TRACK

69
00:01:58,901 --> 00:01:59,868
IF HER PHONE NUMBER WAS

70
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:00,769
DISCUSSING ANYTHING WITH HIS

71
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:01,837
PHONE NUMBER BUT NOT THE

72
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:03,172
ACTUAL CONTENT OF WHAT WAS

73
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:03,872
GOING BACK AND FORTH.

74
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:05,240
SO THEY KNOW THEY WERE

75
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,275
CONTACTING EACH OTHER.

76
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:06,808
>> EXACTLY.

77
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:08,076
>> Martha: ANDREW, WHAT DO

78
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:08,877
YOU THINK?

79
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:11,947
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, AS

80
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:12,848
CATHERINE SAID THESE ARE

81
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:13,782
INTERESTS THAT HAVE TO BE

82
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:14,149
BALANCED.

83
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:15,584
THE GOVERNMENT HAS A VERY

84
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:16,318
IMPORTANT INTEREST HERE.

85
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:17,753
THE LEAKING CLASSIFIED

86
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:22,024
INFORMATION HAS BEEN

87
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:22,824
OUTRAGEOUS.

88
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:24,026
GOING BACK TO BEFORE WHEN

89
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:25,260
TRUMP WAS SWORN INTO OFFICE.

90
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,129
AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE TO

91
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,831
HAVE A FREE ROBUST PRESS.

92
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:31,166
I THINK JUDITH'S CASE FOR

93
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,769
EXAMPLE IS A CAUTIONARY TALE

94
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:34,970
OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE

95
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,873
A CASE THAT ISN'T MERITORIOUS

96
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:39,141
ENOUGH TO USE THIS KIND OF

97
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:41,843
EXTREME MEASURE THAT THE

98
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:44,813
GOVERNMENT HAS.

99
00:02:44,813 --> 00:02:46,448
ON THE OTHER HAND HAVING HAD

100
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:47,716
OVER THE YEARS TO APPLY THE

101
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:49,084
GUIDELINES YOU HAVE TO MAKE A

102
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:49,451
BALANCING.

103
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:51,653
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IN

104
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:54,122
THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE FIRST

105
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:56,425
AMENDMENT, THE JOURNALIST IS

106
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:58,560
NOT GIVEN A PRIVILEGE AT LEAST

107
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,362
MUCH OF ONE ABOVE AND BEYOND

108
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:02,030
WHAT THE NORMAL PERSON HAS IN

109
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,131
TERMS OF PRIVACY.

110
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:05,067
SO, I THINK YOU HAVE TO

111
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:07,436
BALANCE IS THERE A VERY

112
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:08,337
SERIOUS CASE?

113
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:10,572
IS THE JOURNALISTS SOMEHOW

114
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:12,808
IMPLICATED IN IT EITHER AS

115
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:14,042
SOMEBODY WHO WITNESSED IT,

116
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:19,047
SOMEBODY WHO PARTICIPATED IN

117
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:21,850
IT, IS IT A SITUATION THAT

118
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,951
ONLY THE JOURNALISTS HAS

119
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:23,685
INFORMATION THAT THE

120
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:24,620
PROSECUTOR NEEDS TO MAKE THIS

121
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,254
SERIOUS CASE?

122
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:26,755
IF YOU CAN'T CHECK ALL THOSE

123
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:28,056
BOXES WE SHOULDN'T BE TALKING

124
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:28,590
ABOUT THIS.

125
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,625
>> Martha: A LOT OF THIS

126
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,692
OBVIOUSLY GOES BACK TO TRYING

127
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:32,060
TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE

128
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,961
INFORMATION CAME OUT THAT LED

129
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:37,466
TO THE INVESTIGATION.

130
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,467
AND THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

131
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:40,035
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE

132
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:41,003
PRESIDENT WANTS TO LEARN MORE

133
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:41,536
ABOUT.

134
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:42,938
CARTER PAGE IS ONE OF THE

135
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:46,174
STORIES THAT SHE WROTE ABOUT.

136
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:50,112
YOU BELIEVE THERE IS AN

137
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:52,214
ANTI-TRUMP BIAS COMING FROM

138
00:03:52,214 --> 00:03:53,915
MR. WOLFE, WHO WE SHOULD POINT

139
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:55,684
OUT, JUDY, HAS BEEN WORKING ON

140
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:56,184
THIS FOR DECADES.

141
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:58,420
HE HAD A LOT OF ACCESS TO

142
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,354
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AS HE

143
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:00,188
BROUGHT IN WITNESSES.

144
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:01,790
HE HAD A VERY HIGH LEVEL

145
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,995
CLEARANCE IN ALL OF THIS.

146
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:07,429
>> ABSOLUTELY.

147
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:08,563
BUT HE IS NOT CHARGED WITH

148
00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:09,264
LEAKING CLASSIFIED

149
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:09,731
INFORMATION.

150
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:10,265
>> Martha: NO.

151
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:11,366
>> HE IS CHARGED WITH LYING TO

152
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:11,767
THE F.B.I.

153
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:14,569
SO IT'S VERY HARD TO KNOW WHAT

154
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:15,937
THE NATIONAL SECURITY

155
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:17,471
INTERESTS HERE ARE SUPPOSED

156
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:18,774
BEING JEOPARDIZED.

157
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:20,676
I THINK AS A JOURNALIST AND WE

158
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:22,477
HAVE TO, WE ALL HAVE TO BE

159
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:24,012
SUSPICIOUS OF THE GOVERNMENT

160
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:24,446
MOTIVES.

161
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:26,214
ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S

162
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:27,616
INTERESTING TO ME THAT AS THE

163
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:33,255
GOVERNMENT POINTED OUT SHE WAS

164
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:35,290
THE ONLY REPORTER WHOSE

165
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,224
RECORDS WERE SEIZED.

166
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:37,426
THE OTHER THREE REPORTERS THAT

167
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:38,327
WASN'T THE CASE.

168
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:39,661
>> Martha: IT MAY BE,

169
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:41,663
ANDREW, AS THEY DIG INTO THIS,

170
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:43,832
PERHAPS THERE WAS AN ISSUE OF

171
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:45,067
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

172
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,368
WE JUST DON'T KNOW THAT YET.

173
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:47,502
THEY WERE ABLE TO NAIL HIM

174
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:48,470
DOWN WITH THE INTERACTIONS HE

175
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,271
HAD WITH THE REPORTER.

176
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:50,972
SHE CLAIMS HE NEVER RELEASED

177
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:52,274
ANY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

178
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:54,176
>> WELL, I THINK MARTHA, IT'S

179
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:55,577
POSSIBLE THAT THE CASE HAS

180
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:58,380
BEEN CHARGED IN A STRATEGIC

181
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,349
WAY BY CHARGING IT AS A

182
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:01,983
THREE-COUNT FALSE STATEMENTS

183
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:03,118
CASE THERE IS AT LEAST A

184
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:04,286
CHANCE THAT THE PROSECUTORS

185
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:05,587
WON'T HAVE TO MAKE DISCOVERY

186
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:06,822
IN THE CASE OF WHAT THE

187
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:12,828
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IS.

188
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:16,164
THE SKEPTICAL AMONG US WILL

189
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:17,566
SAY IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE

190
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:18,333
KEEPING UNDER WRAPS THIS IS

191
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,835
NOT A SERIOUS CASE.

192
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:21,470
HOPEFULLY WE'D BE ABLE TO SAY

193
