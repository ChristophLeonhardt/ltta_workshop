OVER A YEAR IN MASSACHUSETTS,

39
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,221
BUT SHE HAS NEVER BEEN FOCUSED

40
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:16,223

41
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:17,824

WOMAN, AS SHE PUTS IT, WHEN SHE

53
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:33,006

54
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:34,841
HAS GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY,

55
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:36,009

56
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,011
DEMOCRATS, IT OPENS A DOOR AND

57
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:40,214
NOW WE HAVE THIS ABILITY TO USE

58
00:01:40,214 --> 00:01:42,816
THIS TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL.

59
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:43,484
HERE'S WHAT KEVIN McCARTHY

60
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:44,551
SAID THAT GOT HIM IN A LOT OF

61
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:46,153
HOT WATER DURING THE BENGHAZI

62
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:46,453
DAYS.

63
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:48,822
WATCH THIS.

64
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:50,224
>> EVERYBODY THOUGHT

65
00:01:50,224 --> 00:01:50,991
HILLARY CLINTON WAS UNBEATABLE,

66
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:52,092
RIGHT?

67
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:55,296
BUT WE PUT TOGETHER A BENGHAZI

68
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:57,197
SPECIAL COMMITTEE, A SELECT

69
00:01:57,197 --> 00:01:58,899
COMMITTEE, WHAT ARE HER NUMBERS

70
00:01:58,899 --> 00:01:59,233
TODAY?

71
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:01,035
HER NUMBERS ARE DROPPING.

72
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:01,568
WHY?

73
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:02,603
BECAUSE SHE IS ON TRUSTABLE.

74
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:03,837
NO ONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN ANY OF

75
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:06,607
THAT HAD HAPPENED --

76
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:07,141
>> I AGREE.

77
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:11,011
>> Martha: HE SAID WE USED THE

78
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:12,246
BENGHAZI COMMITTEE TO ACHIEVE A

79
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:12,546
GOAL.

80
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:14,381
SHE SAID THE SAME THING.

81
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:16,050
WHEN HE SAID, DEMOCRATS WERE UP

82
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,986
IN ARMS AT HOW HE COULD BE

83
00:02:18,986 --> 00:02:20,187
SO COLD AND CALCULATING.

84
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,423
HOW COME THEY ARE NOT RESPONDING

85
00:02:22,423 --> 00:02:24,191
TO WHAT SHE SAID, IF THEY DON'T

86
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:26,226
LIKE THESE SITUATIONS TO BE USED

87
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:28,762
POLITICALLY?

88
00:02:28,762 --> 00:02:29,897
>> THE FACT IS ELIZABETH WARREN

89
00:02:29,897 --> 00:02:31,832
IS USING THIS.

90
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:32,900
THERE IS NO PRESUMPTION OF

91
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,535
INNOCENCE FOR HER IN THE CASE OF

92
00:02:34,535 --> 00:02:35,035
BRETT KAVANAUGH.

93
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:36,804
THIS IS A CHANCE FOR HER TO TRY

94
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:37,671
TO MAKE POLITICAL BONUS POINTS

95
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:40,441
FOR HERSELF IN AN EFFORT TO GET

96
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:41,608
TO THE FAR PROGRESSIVE LEFT-WING

97
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:44,445
NOMINATION FOR 2020.

98
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:45,646
SHE IS, AGAIN, IGNORING

99
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:47,214
MASSACHUSETTS IN THE PROCESS.

100
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:48,482
SHE HAS NEVER BEEN WORKING FOR

101
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:49,650
OUR STATE, SHE CLEARLY DOESN'T

102
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,851
CARE ABOUT WORKING FOR OUR STATE

103
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:52,252
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS IF SHE

104
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:54,054
RUNS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.

105
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:56,223
SHE IS AN OPPORTUNIST OF THE

106
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:56,690
HIGHEST DEGREE.

107
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,324
>> Martha: YOU GOT A TOUGH

108
00:02:57,324 --> 00:02:58,259
BATTLE ON YOUR HANDS.

109
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:00,594
YOU ARE DOWN ABOUT 26 POINTS IN

110
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:01,495
THE MOST RECENT POLL.

111
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:03,798
HOW DO YOU HOPE TO CLOSE THAT

112
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:05,332
GAP IN 36 DAYS?

113
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:07,001
>> THE SAME POLLING COMPANY HAD

114
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,836
ME NECK AND NECK WITH MY TRIGGER

115
00:03:08,836 --> 00:03:09,804
PRIMARY OPPONENTS.

116
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:11,806
I WANT MARK TO: MICHAEL AND FRED

117
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:12,707

118
00:03:12,707 --> 00:03:14,175
HIM WHEN HE FIRST RAN AGAINST

119
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:16,611
MARTHA COAKLEY IN 2010.

120
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:17,612
SAME POLLING COMPANY.

121
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:18,613
NO SURPRISE.
