I'm single this year for
the very first time.
All I want is a man who's
not committed a crime.
Oh boy.
But that feels very unlikely
in this landscape we're in
Much to my chagrin.
And so I’m going
on dates
And I'm truck'n along
But then all of these dudes,
they say a million things wrong.
So here's some examples
of the straight dating scene
In two thousand and eighteen.
Hey.
Hey.
Have you
been reading the news?
Yeesh! Maybe let's order some booze?
Well, I’d really like
to hear about your views.
This movement's gotten
just a touch out of hand.
Well, change only
happens after taking a stand.
Hey! Would you ever want to
come see my band?
What did you say? Ugh!
That's not ok!
I'm feeling triggered
and you've ruined my day.
Hey hey ho ho!
Donald Trump's gotta go!
Join the resistance,
you tone deaf Joe Schmoe.
Singing ooh,
This guy's garbage
Ooh, this guy's clearly a foe.
You see we’re victims
of systemic oppression.
Yeah, but thank God we’re in
a time of progression.
Your deflection is
a microaggression.
I didn’t mean it.
Please don't be mad.
Aw, buddy. Do you have more to add?
Hashtag
not all men are that bad.
What did you say?
That's not ok!
I'm feeling triggered in
every which way.
Doesn't that plant look great?
Go ahead masturbate
While I call Ronan Farrow
to break up this date.
Singing ooh,
men are toxic.
Oooh,
Why on earth am I straight?
So I think time is up,
I'm done with this
Even though I'm a white feminist
I still need to complain.
Oprah, please save my brain.
So I assume you've roofied my beer.
Geez, that joke is
way too severe.
Well, we’ve had a terrible year.
I swear I sympathize
with your plight.
How? You're a straight
cisgendered man who is white.
Wow, can I say anything right?
What did you say?
That's not ok!
My cat person doesn't exist anyway.
Unless it's my cat.
That's it!
I'll marry my cat!
He wouldn't hurt me
because he's not like that.
Singing ooh,
Everyone meet Trent.
Actually, cats can’t consent.
Fair enough.
