>> Neil: YOU KNOW, YOU CAN
ALMOST HEAR REPUBLICANS ACROSS
THE COUNTRY AFTER DEBBIE LASKO
WON IN ARIZONA.
CONGRATULATIONS.
WELCOME.
>> THANKS SO MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.
>> YOU KNOW, THERE WERE SO MANY
CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR RACE AND
THAT YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU WANTED
TO WIN OBVIOUSLY, BUT THERE WAS
THIS TIDE GOING THAT IT WASN'T
HAPPENING THAT WAY.
VERY QUICKLY, DEMOCRATS AND MANY
IN THE ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA SAID
YEAH, YOU DIDN'T WIN BY THE SAME
MARGIN THAT, YOU KNOW, DONALD
TRUMP HAD WON YOUR DISTRICT.
SO HOW DO YOU ANSWER THAT AND
THE HIGH EXPECTATIONS THAT WERE
HAD?
>> WELL, I CERTAINLY WISH I
WOULD HAVE WON BY MORE BUT THE
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT I WIN.
WHO IS NOT BEING SAID IS MY
DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT SPENT OVER A
MILLION DOLLARS ON FALSE TV
ATTACK ADDS AND I DIDN'T ATTACK
HER.
SO THAT HAS TO BE PUT IN PLAY AS
WELL.
HEY, I WON AND I'M A
CONGRESSWOMAN AND I'M GOING TO
CONTINUE TO WORK HARD FOR THE
CONSTITUENTS IN THE WEST VALLEY
OF PHOENIX AREA AND ARIZONA.
I'M GOING TO BE GOING TO
CONGRESS SOON AND BE SWORN IN
PROBABLY MAY 7.
>> Neil: THAT SOON?
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THE
PRESIDENT AT ALL?
>> I DID.
IT WAS VERY EXCITING.
HE CALLED ME YESTERDAY MORNING.
WE HAD A REALLY GOOD
CONVERSATION.
WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HE
CONGRATULATED ME AND WE TALKED
ABOUT ARIZONA AND POLITICS AND
HOW THE RACE WENT.
IT WAS A GOOD LONG CONVERSATION.
I REALLY APPRECIATED IT.
I ASKED HIM IF I COULD GO MEET
HIM IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
HE SAID SURE.
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM UP ON
THAT.
>> Neil: AREN'T YOU A BIG
CHEESE.
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS,
CONGRATULATIONS.
IT WAS QUITE A HEROIC EFFORT.
IT WAS LOOKING DICEY AS YOU
POINTED OUT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING GIVEN THE
CLOSENESS OF YOUR RACE IN A
STRONG REPUBLICAN AREA, MIGHT BE
TELEGRAPHING PROBLEMS FOR
REPUBLICANS IN NOVEMBER.
DO YOU BUY THAT?
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT
A WIN IS A WIN.
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.
A WIN IS A WIN.
BUT REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN HAVING
A DEVIL OF A TIME IN A LOT OF
THESE CONTESTS.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN
PENNSYLVANIA WITH A FEW OF THOSE
CONTESTS AND IN ALABAMA.
SPECIAL SITUATIONS.
BUT ALL HAVE BEEN COREY SOME FOR
REPUBLICANS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> I THINK THAT REPUBLICANS NEED
TO CONTINUE TO BE ENERGIZED AND
BECOME MORE ENERGIZED.
IT'S NORMAL FOR THE PARTY THAT
IS NOT IN POWER TO BE ENERGIZED
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TAKE BACK
THE MAJORITY.
THEY WANT TO TAKE BACK THE
MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND THE
SENATE AND TAKE BACK THE
PRESIDENCY.
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO WORK HARD
TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T
HAPPEN.
I WANT TO BE A CONGRESSWOMAN IN
A MAJORITY CONGRESS.
I WANT A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT
THAT IS DOING A GOOD JOB.
>> Neil: YOU WANT TO JOIN THE
FREEDOM CAUCUS?
40 CONSERVATIVE CONGRESSMEN BUT
I STRESS ALL MEN.
YOU WOULD BE THE FIRST WOMAN.
>> YEAH, ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?
I'D BE THE FIRST WOMAN BUT THE
ONLY WOMAN RIGHT NOW.
>> Neil: ONLY WOMAN NOW.
>> YEAH.
MY CONGRESSMAN, TRENT FRANKS, HE
WAS A MEMBER OF THE FREEDOM
CAUCUS.
ALMOST ALL OF THE CONGRESSMEN
FROM ARIZONA ARE MEMBERS OF THE
FREEDOM CAUCUS --
>> Neil: ALL OF THOSE MEMBERS AS
YOU KNOW VOTED AGAINST THE $1.3
TRILLION SPENDING MEASURE THAT
THE PRESIDENT LAMBASTED.
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO RESCIND A
LOT OF THAT SPENDING.
MITCH McCONNELL SAID HE CAN'T TO
THAT, IT'S NOT WISE.
HE AGREED TO IT OR HIS PEOPLE
AGREED TO IT PRIOR SO TOO LATE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> THE PART THAT I LIKED ABOUT
IT IS THAT IT INCREASED MILITARY
FUNDING AND GAVE RAISES TO THE
TROOPS.
I LIKE THAT.
THE THING I DON'T LOOK ABOUT IT,
INCREASES THE DEFICIT.
IF I WAS THERE, I WOULD HAVE
FOUGHT FOR CUTTING IN AREAS
WHERE THERE'S WASTEFUL SPENDING
SO WE'RE NOT INCREASING THE
DEBT.
WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN
THIS.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO CUT
SPENDING.
I CERTAINLY THOUGH LIKE THE TAX
CUTS THAT WE DID.
IT'S GOOD FOR AMERICA.
IT'S GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY.
IT'S GOOD FOR MY CONGRESSIONAL
