here's a weird one a woman was booed and removed from stage for reciting the words of a Pulitzer Prize winner while standing next to the puled surprise winner who then said that she could not say the words that he wrote and made millions of dollars off of after he had already brought her onstage to recite the very words seem crazy good because this is a really uncomfortable weird one I'm Ben Davies this is pure Olly wood by some crazy chance or mercury being in retrograde or some Jedi mind trick or just too much booze Kendrick Lamar somehow won the Pulitzer Prize in music in 2018 oh it helps to pan to the people who give out the awards anyway our happy story takes a fatal turn at the hangout festival in Gulf Shores Alabama a loving fan who paid her good money to go see one of her favorite rappers performed was brought up on stage to sing the Kendrick Lamar classic mad city what could go wrong well maybe it's because the chorus of this beautiful ballad by Kendrick Lamar has a few tricky spots in it the chorus goes as follows quote man down where you from n-word f-word who you know were you from my n-word weird grandma stay huh my n-word this mad City I run my n-word unquote I wonder what could go wrong well normally Kendrick Lamar would just say these words get millions of dollars his fans would sing it constantly be played through the airwaves almost 24/7 nothing happened so what happened here now when you think about it this award-winning rapper should have known that 13% of his chorus contains a very divisive word almost like the guy that wrote it in sings that constantly should know exactly what's in his song and exactly who is about to sing it but don't worry after this young lady was asked to sing this course kendrick lamar stepped in he said quote you gotta believe that one word out though conceivably after he realized he was standing next to a caucasian female the entire time and then astor saying she apologized by saying quote i'm used to singing it the way you wrote it unquote all in all it just seems like a young woman who was a fan who paid money to sing one of her favorite rappers who happens to be a pure surprise winner was blasted for seeing the same words that the performer is praised for it makes millions off of now obviously there was history and nuances to every situation like this and by no means do I want this word popularized or more people going out and saying it thinking it's okay but really dude you brought her up there you asked her to sing then you virtue signaled over an entire crowd of people after she sang what you asked her to recite I mean really come on dude because now this girl who is brought on stage to sing your lyrics is gonna be known as the girl that said that word and as a person who was awarded for their accomplishments in musical composition I think you know that so I think you kind of knew what you were doing there and that's pretty messed up I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood and another fantastic news you can now download the rebel and take me with you wherever you go to get exclusive content and the entire rebel lineup you
