colleagues good morning welcome to our special briefing today we will share detailed information about the crash of the Aleutian Islands er pulling out the Russian airspace forces off the Syrian coast on September 17th we will present a minute-by-minute account of this tragic incident that was made that was made based on the objective radar readings including those from the cloud of air information display system on September the 17th the Russian reconnaissance aircraft Aleutian high of 20 began its special mission in the EDA libby's collation zone at 20 31 the plane has a total of 15 servicemen on board at the same time of poor Israeli f-16 fighter jets everything israel's airspace to carry out a surprise attack on some industrial facilities in the Syrian Arab Republic you can see the flight route of the Israeli Jets on the screen the f16 jets flew over the neutral waters of the Mediterranean Sea and began patrolling an area 90 kilometers west of Latakia at 21:39 a colonel of the israeli earthmovers in Hoorn the Russian command in Syria via the deconfliction channel about the upcoming air strike she said that within the next few minutes Israel would attack something dust really facilities in northern Syria in one minute's time at 2144 Israeli f16 jets dropped gbu 39 guided bombs targeting industrial facilities in the province of Latakia thus Israel did not inform the Russian forces about its operation in advance but rather they issued a warning simultaneously with the beginning of the strike which constitutes a breach of the existing agreements these actions constitute a clear violation of the 2015 Russian Israeli agreements to prevent clashes between our armed forces in an over Syria that were reached by the Joint Working Group here you can see the positions of the aircraft at the moment of the strike captured by the Pluto system Russia's Aleutian Isle 20 is represented by the red mark on the map and for Israeli f16 jets by yellow ones I would like to stress that during the negotiations by the deconfliction channel the representative of the israeli air force reported that the targets assigned to the israeli aircraft were located in northern syria the conversation was in Russian the Russian Defense Ministry has a record of the conversation the commander of the Aleutian Isle 20 flying over the north of Syria received in order to leave the mission area and head south to return back to the airbase as you can see on the map the Israeli Jets delivered strikes Latakia which is a western province of the country not in the north of the Syrian Arab Republic the city of Latakia located on the western coast the misleading information provided by the Israeli officer about the aerial strikes did not allow the Russian aisle 20 air plane to move timely to a safe area Israel also did not provide any information about the location of the f16 jets 21:51 the Syrian Air Defense Forces began to repel the Israeli attack and launched surface-to-air missiles after the strike the Israeli Jets again began patrolling an area 70 kilometres west of the Syrian coast they deployed electronic countermeasures and were probably preparing for another strike at 2159 one of the Israeli Jets started maneuvering towards the Syrian coast approaching the aleutian aisle to Andy that was making its approach for landing the Syrian air defense units considered its maneuver to be another attack by the Israeli Air Force the Israeli pilot certainly knew that the aleutian aisle has a much larger radar cross-section than f-16 and because of that the Russian aircrafts would be the preferred target for a surface-to-air missile Russia and Syria used different friend-or-foe systems and because of that Syrian radars were likely to identify an Aleutian aisle - and as a group of Israeli Jets at this time the Aleutian Islands made a maneuver for final approach towards the mainly Meir beasts and crossed paths with the fire trajectory of the Syrian air defense systems targeting these really Jets I would like to put special emphasis on the fact that the Israeli Jets saw their Russian dilutional and used it as a shield against the surface-to-air missiles while they here done maneuvering in the region 22:03 a Syrian surface-to-air missile engaged the largest and closest target which was the Aleutian Islands the commander reported the aircraft on fire and began emergency descent at 22:07 the Russian English and il-23 connaissance airplane disappeared from radars at the same time as you can see the Israeli Jets continues to stay in this area patrolling the airspace until 20 to 40 20 to 29 an officer of the Russian command in Syria reported to an officer at Israeli Air for command post that the Russian illusion il 20 aircraft was in distress he said we demand that the Israeli aircraft leave the area as we need to engage our rescue teams an Israeli lieutenant replied that he had received the information and would forward it to the command at 22:40 the Israeli f16 jets left the area after that at 2253 which is 15 minutes after the Russian plane was hit by a missile the colonel of the israeli air force command center who was the officer on duty came on the radio and reported we got your information that the Aleutian island is in distress we have cleared clear the area if you need assistance we are ready to help the presented objective data indicates that the actions of the Israeli fighter pilots which led to the loss of life of fifteen Russian servicemen be the relax professionalism over an act of criminal negligence to say the least therefore we believe that the blame for the tragedy with the Russian Aleutian Islands aircraft lies entirely with these Rayleigh air forces and those who made the decision to carry out such actions I would like to emphasize that on September 17th the Israeli Air Force fighter aircrafts who are manoeuvring in the approach area of the may mean airfield that is used not only by military but also civilian passenger aircraft thus the Israeli Jets created a direct threat to any passenger or cargo aircraft that could have been there at the time and could have become victims of the debtor ISM of the Israeli military currently a search operation is being carried out to retrieve the bodies of the deceased and wreckage from the water at the crash site of the Russian Aleutian aisle seven kilometers west of the port of danya's another point I would like to make is that Israeli pilots became very differently here the to the US pilots deployed in the region as you all know we have a communication channel set up to prevent air incidents the parties inform each other in advance about their plans for air force missions in various parts of Syria this enables us to undertake new measures in time in order to prevent any situations that would threaten Russian or US forces both in the air and on the ground Russia has never violated the agreement with Israel and has never used the Russian air defense weapons deployed in Syria despite the fact that Israel's air strikes caused situations that potentially threaten the safety of Russian servicemen during the timeframe covered by the agreements the israeli air force command center received 310 notifications about russian air force missions running close to Israeli territory during the same time these are really should only 25 notifications it did so just before attacks in the context of constructive Russian Israeli cooperation in the Syrian Arab Republic it is difficult for us to understand the reasons behind such actions by tel-aviv this is an extremely ungrateful response to all that has been done by the Russian Federation for Israel and for the Israeli people recently I would like to remind you that as a result of the operation conducted in the southwestern de-escalation zone in Syria by government troops supported by Russian airspace forces this summer the UN peacekeeping contingent was able to resume its work on the border between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights in accordance with the UN Security Council resolution 350 adopted in 1974 on August the 2nd 2018 the UN peacekeeping contingent accompanied by the Russian military police organized patrols in the Golan Heights area for the first time after a six-year hiatus Russian military support of this mission ensured that they were no shelling attacks on Israeli territory from the Golan Heights currently six observation posts of the Russian military police are set up along the Bravo line providing security for the UN mission staff in order to prevent missile strikes from iran-backed formations these are all requested to settle the situation in the area adjacent to the Golan Heights where Iran back formations deploy heavy weapons Russia consulted with Iran and Tehran said that he did not consider it right to aggravate the situation in the area and had no aggressive intentions against Israel as a result with the assistance of the Russian forces all Iran back for nations with heavy weapons were withdrawn from the Golan Heights to a safe distance from Israel more than 140 kilometers to the east of Syria a total of 1,050 personnel twenty-five multi rocket launch systems and tactical missiles as well as 145 pieces of other munitions and military hardware were withdrawn from the area at the request of Israel the Russian command in Syria repeatedly assured Israel that no sensitive the munitions and equipment shipped from Russia to Syria will end up in the possession of a third party Israel has repeatedly stressed the importance of the work carried out by the Russian Ministry of Defense in this area and expressed gratitude to Russian specialists in 2016 at the urgent request of the chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Lieutenant General Gary Eisen called Israel received the Maga 310 captured in 1982 in Lebanon and kept in Russia since that time the tank was transferred in the presence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the Russian minister of defense gave assistance to preserve Jewish sacred objects and burials in the city of Aleppo this work was mediated by the President of the Federation of Jewish communities of Russia Alexander Barada this contribution was highly appreciated by the Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman besides Israel appealed to Russia with a request to help find the remains of Israeli servicemen located at specific coordinates in Syria the search was organized after Russia agreed the operation with our Syrian partners this special search operation was conducted in a combat area controlled by Isis terrorists suddenly attacked the Russian servicemen involved in the search operation one Russian officer was wounded despite that Russia was ready to carry on with the operation in view of the above the hostile actions committed by the Israeli Air Force against the Russian Ellucian aisle to entire craft cross the line of civilised relations the objective data about the September 17th incident that was presented to you today shows that the military leadership of Israel either has no appreciation for the level of relations with Russia or has no control over individual commands or commanding officers who understood that their actions would lead to tragedy
