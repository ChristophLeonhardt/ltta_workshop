over 14 years almost 500 patients were fitted with an experimental unapproved device at Mexico's top public neurological institute you'll and the Guerrera was among them it was done without her or her husband's knowledge they asked us to sign a bit of paper but never that it was going to be a valve or a tube that was part of an experiment they never told us anything about that three doctors working at the Institute at the time told Al Jazeera that the same is true for other patients who received the implant it was designed to treat hydrocephalus that's excess fluid in the brain by draining it down through a tube into the stomach area this man invented the device and patented it Julio Sotelo he was also the director of the same national neurology and neurosurgery Institute where it was pressed into use despite never being approved by medical authorities there was a recommendation I would say a demand that you had to recognize the brilliant idea of Sotelo the Institute the Health Ministry and dr. Sotelo himself all refused to talk to Al Jazeera he's always maintained that studies show his device was effective neither he nor the National Institute has ever been sanctioned for its unauthorized use despite a commission of medical arbitrage clearly stating that malpractice occurred in Yolanda's case dr. Edgar natal who still works at the National Institute has one word for it all impunity impunity at every level he says meanwhile Yolanda and Juan Manuel had to sell their flat to pay medical bills their claims for compensation have fallen on deaf ears Mexico's Attorney General's Office kept them waiting for eight years only to tell them it wouldn't take any action all the time you Landis health is worsening although it's unclear if that has any connection to the device I'm frightened of dying of leaving my daughter I'm just so tired there are days in which I just think it would be better if I died against the backdrop of silence a congresswoman and NGOs have taken the case to the inter-american Human Rights Commission it's unlikely to succeed but it is a fresh attempt to get justice for the hundreds of people treated as guinea pigs over 14 years John Holman al-jazeera Mexico City
