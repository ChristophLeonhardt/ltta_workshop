00:00:02,358 --> 00:00:04,126
>> Shepard: AND BREAKING THIS

2
00:00:04,127 --> 00:00:05,293
AFTERNOON, THE JUSTICE

3
00:00:05,294 --> 00:00:07,829
DEPARTMENT HAS NOW CHARGED A

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,264
RUSSIAN WOMAN FOR CONSPIRACY TO

5
00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:10,198
INTERFERE WITH NEXT MONTH'S

6
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:12,367
MID-TERM ELECTIONS.

7
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:13,335
IT'S THE FIRST CRIMINAL CASE

8
00:00:13,336 --> 00:00:14,770
AGAINST A FOREIGN NATIONAL

9
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:18,140
RELATED TO THE COMING MID-TERMS.

10
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:26,882
HER NAME IS ELAINE HUSOVIA.

11
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:28,517
SHE WORKED ON A PROJECT THAT

12
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:30,719
PROSECUTORS SAY WAS DESIGNED TO

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,754
CREATE DIVISION IN AMERICA'S

14
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:33,288
POLITICAL SYSTEM.

15
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:34,923
BY PLANTING MISINFORMATION

16
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:36,591
ONLINE, ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM

17
00:00:36,592 --> 00:00:37,425
IMMIGRATION TO GUN CONTROL.

18
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:40,562
IN THE WORDS OF THE FBI

19
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:43,198
DIRECTOR, CHRIS WRAY, THIS IS A

20
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:45,734
STARK REMINDER TO ALL AMERICANS,

21
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:47,369
OUR FOREIGN ADVERSARIES CONTINUE

22
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,604
TO INTERFERE IN OUR DEMOCRACY BY

23
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:51,206
CREATING SPECIAL AND POLITICAL

24
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:52,707
DIVISION, SPREADING DISTRUST IN

25
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,376
OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM AND

26
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:56,178
ADVOCATING FOR THE SUPPORT OR

27
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:58,680
DEFEAT OF MORE POLITICAL

28
00:00:58,681 --> 00:00:59,080
CANDIDATES.

29
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:01,283
SO THIS AFTERNOON, AN ACCUSATION

30
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:03,885
THAT RUSSIA IS UP TO ITS OLD

31
00:01:03,886 --> 00:01:04,219
TRICKS.

32
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,420
THE CHIEF INTELLIGENCE

33
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:06,188
CORRESPONDENT CATHERINE HERRIDGE

34
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:09,157
ON FOX'S TOP STORY LIVE ON

35
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:10,425
CAPITOL HILL.

36
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:12,027
CATHERINE?

37
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:13,795
>> SHEP, THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT

38
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:15,664
WAS UNSEALED A HALF HOUR AGAINST

39
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:17,432
IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF

40
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:20,368
VIRGINIA.

41
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,404
THERE'S THESE LARGE SERVER FARMS

42
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:24,606
IN VIRGINIA AND THIS IS WHERE

43
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:27,075
THE FOREIGN INTERFERENCE, IF YOU

44
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:28,877
WILL, TOUCHES DOWN INSIDE THE

45
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:29,344
UNITED STATES.

46
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:30,812
SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT

47
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:32,948
THAT VIRGINIA JURISDICTION.

48
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:35,717
THE 44-YEAR-OLD IS A CITIZEN OF

49
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:40,555
RUSSIA, LIVES IN ST. PETERSBURG

50
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:42,457
AND ALLEGED TO BE INVOLVED IN

51
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,226
PROJECT LOKVA.

52
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:45,460
THIS COULD BE AN AREA AROUND

53
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:46,561
ST. PETERSBURG.

54
00:01:46,562 --> 00:01:48,997
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, SHE'S

55
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:51,099
CONNECTED TO A FIRM CALLED

56
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,466
"CONCORD."

57
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:52,801
THAT FIRM WAS INITIALLY INDICTED

58
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:54,936
BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND

59
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:57,405
THE FBI AS INTERFERING IN THE

60
00:01:57,406 --> 00:01:58,907
2016 ELECTIONS.

61
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:01,042
SO ON ITS FACE, IT DOES SEEM TO

62
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:03,845
BE AN EXTENSION OF THAT

63
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:04,279
INTERFERENCE.

64
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,881
I'D ALSO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO

65
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:08,316
THE DATES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN

66
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:09,517
THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT.

67
00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:12,053
JANUARY 2016 THROUGH JUNE OF

68
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:12,354
2018.

69
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:14,422
AS YOU MENTIONED, SPECIFICALLY

70
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:17,325
TARGETING THE MID-TERM

71
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:17,692
ELECTIONS.

72
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:19,628
CRIMINAL COMPLAINT SAYS THAT SHE

73
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:22,197
HAD A BUDGET OF $45 MILLION FOR

74
00:02:22,198 --> 00:02:24,266
THE INTERFERENCE PROJECT.

75
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:26,101
THOUGH IT SAYS THAT A FRACTION

76
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:27,702
OF THAT MONEY WAS DIRECTED AT

77
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:28,403
THE UNITED STATES.

78
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:30,505
IN ADDITION, IT SAYS THAT THEIR

79
00:02:30,506 --> 00:02:33,241
GOAL WAS TO SOW DISSENSION AMONG

80
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:36,111
AMERICAN CITIZENS AND TO AMPLIFY

81
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:36,478
DIVISIONS.

82
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,480
THEY DID THIS TRYING TO SHIELD

83
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:40,448
THEIR IDENTITIES AS RUSSIAN

84
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:40,882
NATIONALS.

85
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:43,952
THEY USED VPN OR VIRTUAL PRIVATE

86
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:45,353
NETWORKS TO SHIELD WHO THEY WERE

87
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:47,889
AS THEY SET UP E-MAIL AND SOCIAL

88
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,690
MEDIA ACCOUNTS.

89
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:51,359
I WOULD ALSO ADD THE TIME AGO

90
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,795
PEERS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE JUST A

91
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:55,063
COUPLE HOURS AGO, WE HAD A

92
00:02:55,064 --> 00:02:56,698
STATEMENT FROM THE DIRECTOR OF

93
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:58,500
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE THAT

94
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,168
OVERSEES THE 16 INTELLIGENCE

95
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:01,803
AGENCIES, THE HEAD OF THE FBI,

96
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:03,672
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND

97
00:03:03,673 --> 00:03:04,706
HOMELAND SECURITY EXPRESSING

98
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:06,341
WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS

99
00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:07,542
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT

100
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:09,377
INTERFERENCE IN THE UPCOMING

101
00:03:09,378 --> 00:00:00,000
MID-TERM ELECTIONS.
