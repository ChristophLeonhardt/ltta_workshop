thinking of his attorneys there is a report from Bloomberg that says members of the Trump legal team currently lack the security clearances they need to discuss with special care the law firm of Larry Cohen Murli actually and and counsel Rudy can't actually find out what the truth is well they probably learn the lines anyhow according to two people familiar with the matter matter this report this is unbelievable maker and nothing surprised then we've been we've been saying it for such a long time yeah the president is facing an existential threat to his presidency and to his businesses and to him personally and yet Elysee he will not do what it takes to get attorneys who know what they're doing this would be like in 1990 instead of getting the best boxer to go up against Mike Tyson getting Jimmy the Princeton boxing champ 125 pounds and under to fight Mike Tyson I'm serious Bob Muller I have a friend who says he's a cyborg he keeps coming at you and he literally has this motley crew that they've never played in this arena before well no it's almost like a high school football team going up in the NFL and they just don't have the qualifications that are necessary as with this pretty basic correction he does have bad a bad high school football team go ahead not a Texas the point that I keep going back to is if this is if your family member we're in the same position as Donald Trump whose legal team would you want them to have would you want them to have the men and women who are working for Robert Muller on this investigation or the men and women who are currently representing Donald Trump and day by day that changes as and those severe recruitment issues would you want Rudy Guiliani or some of the white collar lawyers who have left prestigious firms to go and work for Robert well I mean Rudy Giuliani in 1993 that would be pretty good Rudy Giuliani in 2018 he's been out of the game yeah listen I like some you know let's just remember Rudy's pretty sorry to me career big strategy when he came in was I know Muller a little bit I'm gonna negotiate an end to this well that's been going well for a couple of weeks uh weeks he's been he's been leaking some great stories team has despite him all right thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
