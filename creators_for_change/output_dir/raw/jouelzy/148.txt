we have to get or legal together and

small business owner or entrepreneur

51
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,270
will understand just the importance of

00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,369
having your illegal together but it's

53
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,439
also going to cost a good bit of money

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,259
at minimum at the bare minimum to get my

55
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,210

no the production<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of self producing</font>

59
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,030
at this point in cutting as<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font>

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,620
as possible while still producing
