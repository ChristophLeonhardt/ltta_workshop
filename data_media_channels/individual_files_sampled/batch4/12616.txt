all right we have a really interesting show for you today you will not hear this anywhere else except for six months from now that's how it works we say it here first and then six months later everybody else is saying it for instance yesterday the GOP failed to repeal and replace Obamacare again and you can expect to hear a lot of people talking about Trump's legislative failures and he can't do anything you know can't get anything done in the Congress even as he starts his new push for tax reform but if you've been listening to this show I've been telling you the Trump is winning two of the most important conservative fights there are and suddenly today this week at least some other commentators people who are not friendly to Trump are catching on which proves that the Andrew Clavin show is where the future comes to rehearse also we have the mailbag whoo-hoo all your problems will be solved but first many people think Donald Trump will be facing a real challenge in the next presidential election Trump's approval ratings are climbing but they're still low and with the Republican Congress divided and incompetent and dishonest and cowardly and reneging on every promise they made for the last eight years and divided and incompetent Trump hasn't managed to get much legislation passed so it's hard to see how he'll ever manage to win re-election especially when you consider the power House Democrat candidates waiting to run against them for instance there's Joe Biden Biden who would be 77 by the time he took office recently told reporters quote you whippersnappers may not remember this but I used to be pretty doggone important around these parts and I'll be darned if I don't know a trick or two you youngsters haven't thought of why if I'm elected president I'm going to appoint what's-his-name to be the what do you call it and that other guy he's right on the tip of my tongue he'll do that other thing you know that the one thing that everybody thinks is such a big deal unquote another hard-driving damn who wants to get in the race as John Kerry Kerry would only be 76 when he took office and wouldn't turn 77 until the month after that Kerry recently told supporters quote if I'm elected I'll tell everyone about that time back in 1967 no wait it was 1968 no 67 that's right oh wait maybe it was later like 69 are we talking about dagnabbit nevermind the whole point is that I was Secretary of State under Barack Obama when I finally brought peace to the Middle East and maybe that was a movie I saw it once maybe I was just thinking about it back in 2012 but was it 2013 that was 12 maybe 13 unquote and of course you can't count another one by Bernie Sanders the socialist Sanders would only be 79 when he took office Sanders recently addressed a crowd of Venezuelans who were either cheering wildly or begging for food and he said quote if I'm elected I will put this country on track to follow the economic model of the Soviet Union which is doing great or was the last time I looked which was on my honeymoon when me and my cutie-pie tripped the light fantastic in Moscow so everything there looked wonderful my socialist policies will revive the America of my youth in the sense that we'll all be driving 1950 Thunderbirds again unquote so as we look ahead to 2020 all the Democrat candidates are raring to go and each and every one of them is eager to do something but they can't remember what it was I'm sure it'll come back to them eventually trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show we also sing see Topsy the zipa teasing it's a wonderful all right it's mailbag day whoa yes oh you almost did it there you almost heatherlindsay whoo-hoo we had the official Lyndsey here but she she said she might come back but I don't see her I guess she just maybe she's out some breakfast all right you know it really is true I mean this this is something it this is annoyed my my wife and children for years I am always right I am always right now and so it's so irritating it is it's so irritating and what people do is rather than admit that I'm always right they tell me I'm wrong they tell me I'm wrong they tell me I'm ridiculous and then about six months later they just start saying what I was saying and they don't give me the credit for that which is fine it's fine so ultimately you have a choice you can watch this show and be annoyed by the fact that I'm always right and I'm saying stuff you don't like but it turns out to be true or you can just watch other shows and find out the same thing six months later one thing I'm always right about is stamps.com right because just like anybody else I do not want my day to suddenly come to a screeching halt like one of those you know do not want that to happen to suddenly have to jump in my car drive to the post office wait on line wait on line some more and finally get the stuff that I need stamps.com brings all the services

to the post office again it you know here are two thing all right so I'm right about stamps comm but I've been right about Donald Trump and Trump is a hard guy to get right because we even haven't seen a politician like him before and everybody gets so swept up in his eccentricities and two things I told you about Trump one that one of the most important things he's doing is the culture war he's winning the culture war or at least he is winning it in in a sense I'll get to two more of that later and people who say oh he's brash and he's lies and he's this and is that I'm missing the entire point and the other thing I've told you about Trump is you can't get too fascinated by him as a person if you want to see the political landscape clearly right because he kind of is like you know he just blinds you with all his stuff all his drama and his craziness and all this stuff and he blinds you to what is actually going on and especially when you have the press this constant noise in your ear both on the right and the left if you asked me on the left there just dishonest and corrupt because on the left they're telling you they're giving you the news but all they're really doing is selling Democrat propaganda but on the right they think that every moment they have to win everything and if they're not winning everything at every moment then they're being betrayed it's a betrayal and they don't even see you know there's an old joke about the Jews as the Jews are people who can't take yes for an answer that's what kind of what the conservatives have become like so let me just let me just run through a little bit of what's going on right I mean first the Trump administration today is proposing its new tax plan people are already screaming about it is raising taxes at lowering taxes I'm not gonna talk about it today because I just it just came out and it you know these things are very complicated and what Trump is proposing is not very detailed like a lot of that is gonna be written in Congress so I don't want to just go off half-cocked and you know talk about it beforehand but that's coming out but it was a defeat another defeat for the GOP Congress John McCain Rand Paul and Susan con shot down the gram Cassidy attempt to reform Obamacare and I know everybody wants Obamacare repealed and I keep telling you it ain't gonna happen that way but this was I thought a step in the right direction moving the financing to the states giving the state's more federalist leeway so eventually Obamacare which is collapsing would be allowed to collapse so here's Lindsey Graham announcing that this isn't going to happen but it will happen eventually it's complicated it's difficult politics instead of quitting you allowed us to move forward and oh my god how far we've come in such a short period of time - president Trump thank you for engaging the vice president pence you have moved mountains Governor Pence has shown us that will flexibility governors with the right attitude can improve quality it's called healthy Indiana so the leadership team has done everything we've asked them we're coming back to this after taxes we're gonna have time to explain our concept we'll have a better process and we're going to take this show on the road I've been up here 20 years I've never enjoyed anything more I believe this is the most important thing I can ever do for the country working with my colleagues is not to just repeal Obamacare but to replace it with a system closer to where you live controlled by people you can vote for and we're going to get there - my Republican colleagues we're gonna fulfill our promise to repeal and replace - the American people we're gonna improve health care for you because at the end of the day that's the only promise that matters okay that's so that's one thing that happened and it feeds into this narrative Trump can't get anything done he doesn't know what he's doing he's not about legislation and all this the other thing that happened was that Roy Moore the judge the very very conservative you know god-fearing crystal waving judge won the primary the Republican primary to replace Jeff Sessions a senator from Alabama and it was a very bizarre thing because Trump was backing Luther strange who was essentially Mitch McConnell's establishment candidate and Roy Moore is the wild man who's kind of thought to be more like Donald Trump people here's what you're gonna hear about this you're gonna hear one that it's that it's unimportant it doesn't really mean anything it doesn't really prove anything and the other thing you're gonna hear about it is that you know it might be better for Republicans if more lost the general because they don't want to tarnish their brand with this wild man who opposes gay marriage and who puts the ten commandments on his you know won't take the 10 commandments down even with a federal court order lost judgeships twice because he wouldn't obey the feds both these things are nonsense it is an important thing first of all it's a major major victory for Steve Bennett Steve Bannon was down there with Sebastian Gorka he was he was campaigning for more on the basis that even though Trump was backing the other guy strange that Moore was the more trumpian candidate and remember Bannon said when he left the White House I'm going to be fighting for and Sebastian Gorka said this too he said we're gonna be fighting for Magga we're gonna be fighting for the reason Trump was elected but what people are calling trumpism rather than Trump and and this is this is a big deal because Trump is watching this stuff Kushner told him to back Moore Kushner has been like you know wrong about virtually everything that he's told him to do he's been keeps telling him to go with the you know middle ground the establishment and it keeps being wrong but this is also a message to Congress which is messing up the GOP Congress is doing nothing if they fail on tax reform they've already failed on Obamacare they say they'll come back to it I actually believe them I do believe they'll come back to it if they don't lose the majority but but still this is a message to them and it matters so this is this is a victory for the Trump movement the Trump attitude the Trump culture and now that's what I'm gonna talk about in a couple minutes now meanwhile if you're watching the left the left is desperate okay they had this NFL thing it blew up in their face they think they think oh we're showing everybody what a racist is continuing the races narrative it's all about race they keep selling this thing that anything about you know the NFL it's race race race nobody cares nobody cares about that I mean it's just these people disrespecting the flag so now they start in they did nothing but cover the NFL and they say why isn't anybody talking about the hurricane in Puerto Rico it's like because you're talking about the NFL that's why so now they're selling you know Hurricane Katrina for those of you don't remember who don't remember what happened they kept doing this to Bush to everything with Bush was a scandal Bush would say hello good morning that was a scandal Bush would walk down the street that was a scandal whatever Bush did it was a scandal and it didn't touch him and then they got Katrina and they got him they got him he made a mistake he didn't take care of the optics and they got him so they're praying they're just praying that's gonna happen with Trump because so far nothing sticks so listen to this montage of them selling you the idea that the hurricane in Puerto Rico is Trump's Katrina it's not the presidential leadership we've come to expect and part of the question we got to confront is is Maria Donald Trump's Katrina sure Michael what do you see do you see the president focused as much as he needs to be in Puerto Rico no you know I don't and be originally being from New Orleans had a lot of family members that were actually impacted by a Katrina and under the ordinary set of circumstances I would probably say this would be the quote/unquote Katrina moment for Don Trump but unfortunately I'm not certain there as much of anything that would push his base against him but and we should be hearing more about that than where is this Katrina this is Katrina it could turn into Katrina or something worth it to spend less time on putting out tweets a more time in addressing this humanitarian crisis because this is going to turn to be mr. Trump Katrina so dream on see this is they oh they hope it is they open his it ain't I mean Trump defended himself he pointed out quite rightly that is you know it's it's harder to get supplies to Puerto Rico than it is to Texas into Florida the administration has been been doing a good job with these hurricanes and I they will stamp it up and he's gonna go and visit them I think visit Puerto Rico next week and I just don't think this is gonna make it so here's the thing the thing well you know what before I do that let me talk about you know before I do that let me talk about air filters I know what you're thinking you're on - all right I'm paying attention to this because I'm worried about my air filters I have to tell you I don't think about air filters either I never think about them okay we had a heat wave here this summer that went on and on and on and on and we had the air conditioning on constantly and not only was it expensive but the filters get messed up you know and people spend a lot of their time indoors where the concentrations of pollutants are like two to five times higher than they typically are outdoors so if you're not changing your filters now like I said I don't think about it but they keep dust level downs that down you know they keep all the germs from coming in not the germs they keep the you know the air from soiled air from coming in and if you have asthma or allergies or anything like that filters are all important I don't think about it either but filter easy thinks about it for you that's what they do filter easy thinks about it for it for you and they solve the number one problem with home air filters which is forgetting to change them the average homeowner changes their home air filters one or two times a year but the minimum

think about and you'll get the air filter so we're going to begin by you know truth comes in funny places I want to pick two guys who do not like Donald Trump they don't like them at all one guy on the left one guy on the right and I'm gonna start shockingly enough at the New York Times stopped clock and a former newspaper or both right every now and again right so let's start by going over to the op-ed page or as we call it knucklehead row okay here is David Brooks who hates Trump the Abbey huh he calls Trump the Abbie Hoffman of the right is Donald Trump now I don't know if you guys remember Abbie Hoffman 1960s he was what they called the hippies they were even beyond the hippies and he was the leader of the riots that took place in the 1968 Chicago convention he was a radical so here's what David Brooks says it has to be admitted that Donald Trump is doing exactly what he was elected to do he was not elected to be a legislative president he never showed any real interest in policy during the campaign he was elected to be a cultural president he was elected to shred the dominant American culture and to give voice to those who felt voiceless in that culture he's doing that every day I mean this is living proof that everything ultimately becomes the Andrew Clavin show you can be reading the New York Times they will try to resist they will attack everything I say or anything any idea that goes through my head and suddenly the New York Times is the Andrew Clavin show except we've already moved on we're already giving you six months in the future David Brooks goes on what's troubling to me is that those who are the targets of his assaults seem to have no clue about what is going on that's extra absolutely right and also the people who are being helped by his assault sometimes don't even know when they feel the most righteous like this past weekend they over the NFL they're actually losing and in the most peril and here is he describes what's going on he says after World War two the Protestant establishment dominated the high ground of American culture and politics that establishment eventually failed to tolerate his segregation and sexism led the nation into war in Vietnam and became stultifying so in the late 1960s along came a group of provocateurs like Abbie Hoffman Jerry Rubin and the rest of the counterculture to upend the Protestant establishment they never attracted majority support for their antics but they didn't have to all they had to do was provoke offend the crew-cut crowd generate outright outrage and set off a cycle that ripped apart the cultural consensus here's Abbie Hoffman here's a quick cut of Abbie Hoffman at the 68 convention explaining what he's doing around Chicago now the machine stumbled and when it stumbles it gets into a policy of overkill and it starts to devour itself so the cops are gonna turn on themselves they'll be fighting they'll be fighting other people in power you see in Grand Central Station they weren't just clubbing us long hairs you see that's not to take on commuters you know and people coming home from the Opera and May is official so wandered around and FBI agents who are there in secret it disguised as hippies they're all getting clubbed just like us okay so that is exactly what Donald Trump does he puts out banana peels and watches his enemies slip on it remember all during the primaries he's doing it now all during the primaries he would do things and it was it was not that he destroyed people's people destroyed themselves because of what he was doing all right Brooks goes on and says the late 1960s were a time of intense cultural conflict which left a lot of wreckage in its wake but eventually a new establishment came into being which we will call the meritocratic establishment people like David Brooks right this establishment too has had its failures it created an economy that benefits itself and leaves everybody else out it led America into he's talking about the elites now he's talking about himself it led America into war in Iraq and sent the working class off to fight it it has developed its own brand of cultural snobbery its media film and music industries make members of the working class feel invisible and disrespected through David Brooks through the medium of David Brooks people who read the New York Times are now hearing the Andrew clay from Joe okay they don't know it but they are so into 16 Brooks says members of the outraged working class elected their own Abbie Hoffman as president Trump is not good at much but he is wickedly good as sticking his thumb in the eye of the educated elites he doesn't have to build a new culture or even attract a majority he just has to tear down the old one and that's another thing I keep telling you that we're in a place where things are falling apart the gravity has left the room all the furnitures floating around and we don't know where it's gonna come down but think about it for a minute sure it can get worse things can get worse but it's so bad for Republicans we were in this place where the GOP was doing what they call in baseball losing comfortably our democracy was slipping away our independence was slipping away our Federal's federalist structure was all slipping away and the right and the left were both sitting there that Republicans were putting up John McCain for president John McCain they're putting up knit Romney I mean they were not putting up the people who represented anybody not the right not the intellectual right and not the base right nothing and so it was just all slipping away is also easy and destroying that culture shaking up that culture is a win for us I'm gonna continue this on the other side but I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube the mailbag is coming up the mailbag all your questions are gonna be answered your miserable life we turn around changed maybe for the better it's a lousy ten bucks a month to get your questions in with that ten bucks you can watch the entire show at the daily wire calm and not be cast out into the exterior darkness if you subscribe for a year it's a lousy hundred bucks and you get the leftist tears tumblr which will continue to fill up with what I'm going to say next okay that's on the Left right so now the left is doing my show pictures of the New York Times and then there's Peter Robinson a pal of mine great guy who was a big speechwriter for Donald Trump he wrote or he claims that with Reagan he wrote that tear down that wall speech he's now runs the terrific website ricochet my friends over there and he's at the Hoover Institute and does one of the greatest interview shows ever which is called uncommon knowledge Peter Robinson so he writes a piece called Trump through a pin hole and this is the other thing I've been saying for months and months which is that Trump himself is a distraction from the reality of the Trump administration Peter says this during the recent Eclipse NASA urged us all to protect our eyes by turning our backs on the Sun itself observing the eclipses only through pinhole cameras a similar technique proves remarkably useful in observing the Trump administration if you ignore the strangely dazzling figure of the President himself examining him instead the second-order effects he's producing you that a certain reassuring clarity emerges to wit Congress may have thwarted the administration's effort to replace Obamacare but wherever the administration has been able to take action on its own it has done just that demonstrating not incompetence but considerable effectiveness and again Peter is not a Trump fan he says at the end of this let me see if I can find it he says Donald Trump is an impulsive vain profane shallow loudmouth inconsistent and overbearing but he then goes on to list all the things I've been listing all this time he appointed Neal Gorsuch but not just Neal courses to the Supreme Court more than 30 other excellent originalist judges to federal courts he took away half of Isis's territory in the middle east changing the strategy there he's been enforcing immigration laws so that illegal entries are down by some 70% he's cutting back business killing EPA over-regulation cutting back oppressive sexual harassment rules at universities right when he was rescinded that Dear Colleague letter eliminating two federal regulations for every new one passed approving important energy pipelines pulling out of a useless climate Accord and exposing our corrupt all Democrat all the time news media as a corrupt all Democrat off the time news media I added that one at the end the rest is Peter Robinson and now yesterday to Jeff Sessions came out in support of free speech and if we have time after the mail bag we'll talk about that too I'm telling you this there's gonna be all kinds of stuff that makes conservatives like me upset because Trump is not a conservative in his legislative heart there's gonna be all kinds of but there is all there are all kinds of reasons to celebrate and the right some of the people on the right are acting like people who cannot take yes for an answer after all this I think I'm gonna have to give a trump a quick Trump Happiness montage we're gonna win so much we're gonna win at every level we're gonna win economically we're gonna win with the economy we're gonna win with military we're gonna win with health caring for our veterans we're going to win with every single facet a wonderful we're gonna win so much you may even get tired of winning yeah you'll say please please it's too much winning we can't take it anymore I do pretty oh so pretty I feel pretty and witty and yeah we have to keep winning it still makes me laugh that thing we got well off to make a new one of it again I've been attacked as an anti-trump er I've written attacks as a pro Trumper I'm just trying to take a realistic assessment of where we are in the midst of all that noise you can listen to it now or you can listen to it six months later someplace else my wife they so annoy theirs well I'm so annoyed with me but but hey it is true you can listen to it ear you can listen to an elsewhere of six months later the mailbag we don't have the real Lyndsey but it'll just have to do from Nicholas a Andrew I love your show and your baldness who could not love my baldness I mean come on I say only Jess it makes just work very hard just but powder a lot of stuff my question is why won't Hillary leave the political stage she can't she can't because when she leaves the political stage it's over when she leaves the political stage there's nothing left but the mirror and who she is instead she can go around and people are still praising her and trying to rehabilitate her you should have seen Charlie Rose talking to her the other day just reading her good reviews into her face you know like you know so she can't because then the dream is over the dream that she's important the dream that she is the president who never was it's all over this is who she is she doesn't have a personal life I mean her husband is not really her husband you know I mean he'd like a fake marriage so you know she can't do it and also and also as long as she's saying making excuses there's some chance that her excuses are true if she stops then she just has to accept that she lost because she was a bad candidate from Jackson at what point should conservatives stop supporting good art that they disagree with can art that disagrees with the conservative movement in every way still be considered good art or is there a limit to how good art can be if it is not conservative well first of all we should never stop supporting good art we should never stop supporting good art for political reasons that is not like yesterday when I was talking to Christian Toto of Hollywood in toto and I was talking to him about whether to boycott certain things we weren't really talking about works of art we were talking about all the ancillary infrastructure that comes with work of what works apart we don't have to watch the Emmys if it's just gonna be one spoiled brat of a multi-millionaire after another telling us we're stupid and our president is a bad guy we don't have to watch that show we don't have to watch football games where they diss our flag we don't have to watch award shows we don't have to watch you know movies that are not actually works of art that are hijacked by the left you know right now they're saying for instance that Wonder Woman should be bisexual in the next movie you know if you don't approve of that you don't have to go see Wonder Woman that's not a work of art you know it's just a movie it's done entertainment you know you don't have to see that but the thing about works of art is that they rise above politics like religion you can do a work of art that is left that intends to be left wing or right wing but it will rise above that I always give the example of 1984 it is an anti-communist work of art but communists have sometimes used it against right-wingers because big brother is a symbol of oppression on both the right and the left anybody can be oppressive right-wingers left-wingers can be oppressive and Big Brother is a good symbol so you good art always informs you just like good religion always informs your conservatism you know the left is not without its points the left is good at pointing out places where people have been left out where things have been done wrong it's always their solutions I disagree with you know their solution is always what does newt gingrich said they wake up in the morning they know the answer is more government they just don't know what the question is I think I think that's that's the problem but it's not you know it's certainly true that minorities have suffered in this country is certainly true that you know women have new roles that they want to play and there's you know difficulty in doing that and all kinds of things that they face you know art real art it just brings people to life it just brings life to life and I don't think we should ever boycott it for for political reasons I do think we should watch for what John Nolte calls the sucker punch when a movie like James Bond has no reason to make a political statement and suddenly they have James Bond like in the Quantum of Solace praising socialism and you think really this is the guy who single-handedly brought down the Soviet Union and now he's praising socialism I mean that just fake and we should point it out all the time all right from Patrick Almighty Clavin gay LVN I was curious about your thoughts as they relate to biblical exegesis you've made your view on the Gospels clear but it seems to me that Paul and plenty of the Church Fathers and Christian thinkers who followed and touched on subjects that Jesus never spoke about absolutely my take on the Bible is is this I you know I take my faith very seriously I believe after long thought I believe that Jesus Christ was the incarnation of the lagos the logic of God the Word of God the third person in the Trinity I believe that he performed miracles that showed that reality is not what it sometimes appears to be I believe that he triumphed over death by being resurrected from the grave my reasons for believing this are are several one is if you read as I'm a very well-read person I know about storytelling I know what story I can recognize different kinds of stories if you read the Gospels what you see are people telling what they saw witnessed or heard about and I think and I believe them they're people of probity they're not you know con men there were they were preaching this stuff in a situation where they could be killed for preaching it many of them were killed many people died because they saw this happen and they believed what they saw with their own eyes and that is one reason to believe it the other reason I believe it is CS Lewis said he not only sees what did he say not only sees the truth of it but he sees it's like the Sun he sees everything else by the light of it the Christianity is the only religion that makes perfect sense of the my lived experience my experience that things are good and bad good and evil morally my experience that I am an i a person and not an illusion thrown up by my brain my experience that death is somehow unnatural to the human condition that is not what we were intended for is not what the godly part of us was intended for and that's why I believe in their argument against Christianity because we have more we have more documented proof of Christianity than we do of Hannibal you know we did then we do if like Julius Caesar we have more documents about Christ from the time than we do have a lot of other more fit Alexander the Great for instance the only reason not to believe that the reason is stuff like that don't happen that's the reason not to believe it okay and my argument with I agree stuff like that don't happen if it did happen it wouldn't be a religion I would just say I was just another guy walking through town all right I believe in the miraculous I've experienced the miraculous I don't believe in magic I don't believe that people suddenly were able to write down words every one of which was absolutely true I believe that they were describing things but I believe like every other author they got things wrong they made mistakes the some of the evidence not mostly in the Gospels they they're parallel stories but there are some contradictions that doesn't bother me people make mistakes especially when things are getting you know panicky and desperate they see things differently they see things from different angles so I don't believe the Bible is a magical book I do believe it is the book that God means us to have about himself so when I look at the aftermath of the Gospels and I look at Paul and I look at the letters of Paul and all this I believe it is inspired I believe God means us to have it but I don't necessarily believe that every single word they say is literally true I think they're think places where their people are wrong I think it I probably wrong about this because I'm talking completely off the top my head but I think it's in Timothy's right something like you shouldn't associate with non-christians well I don't think Jesus would have approved of that I think Jesus wanted you to walk into the lion's den of non Christianity and speak the truth I think that's what he wanted that's what he did I think it's what he wanted you to do there's a major major clash between James the brother of Jesus and Paul if you read Galatians and then you read the book of James I mean Martin Luther the great Protestant reformer believed James should be taken out of the Bible he thought it was such a bad gospel Paul believed you're saved simply by having faith and not by works James said famously faith without works is dead well you know can those both be true yes I believe those can both be true but neither one of those people was in possession of the full truth at the time God is like an umbrella that covers them both why do I think they're both true I think that it's true that Jesus replaces the law and you are saved by your faith in Him but they and him looks like something faith in gravity looks like not walking off a cliff right there are things I don't do because I believe in gravity things I do do because I believe in gravity I put my left is tears tumblr on the desk and I don't expect it to fly up in the air because I believe their things and when James says what good is it if a person comes to you and he's hungry and you say yes I believe in feeding the poor but you don't give him any bread you know that that's what that's James's argument so I believe that the post gospel writings have to be read as a history as the ideas that are developing and I don't always believe that every single word they say exists through all time so for instance Paul will unleash a group of things that he finds sinful and I think well maybe you know that's just his perspective you know I can understand not everything not everything that we think is sinful in our time is sinful I mean after all people used to marry many women you know was that sinful then it doesn't say anywhere in the Bible that is sinful to marry many women I mean you know the people in the Bible knew that that was going to happen people get angry at me when I say this but you cannot send me a quote from the Bible that demands that marriage is between a man one man and one woman you have to interpret that you can't interpret it out of the Bible but you can't find me a quote that says that there's only one quote in the New Testament that says a bishop of the church should only have one wife and that's it you know so I'm just saying that you know it's standards change not everything that everybody says is for all time and so Paul again Paul says in Christ there are no men and women but then later on Paul or some scholars think a pseudo Paul got writing under the name of Paul has all these rules for women that he doesn't have for men you know I think I think that we can look at the Bible as the book God wants us to have without becoming without looking for a foolish consistency that's so I hope that answers the question I'd be willing to talk about it more everybody what everybody gets angry at me about I live I live a conservative life I've been married to the same woman faithfully and devotedly for I think it's now 172 years I think actually it was weird cuz she's still like 32 I don't know how that happens but I've grown old but you know I I live that conservative life but what people get angry about me about with me is that I will not condemn people who live other lives because it says Jesus said don't do do not judge what I took him to mean when he said judge not I took him to me don't judge where another person stands in relationship to God and when I hear a lot of conservative churches thundering for instance about homosexuality from the pulpit I wonder how many people in that congregation are gay probably not that many probably none and so why are they talking about other people's sins when Jesus said take the plank out of your own eye before you remove the remote the mote from someone else's eye and I believe he was being sarcastic because I don't believe you ever get that plank out of your own eye so people get angry at me because I don't condemn other people or judge other people in relationship to God but I do believe that that's what the Gospels demand all right and again I'm happy to talk about this more right in more questions from Seth mr. this will be the last one mr. circle even like that how is truth how his truth seemingly becomes subjective versus objective to some people what can we do to fight this kind of belief okay this is you're talking about moral relativism you know there is a fascinating there's a magazine called philosophy now which is a I believe a dead tree magazine but you can get it online in it this issue there is an article by a fellow named Spencer Clavin I don't know he has the same last night I know he has the same last name as me you had no relation or at least he says there's no relation I claim he's my son but Spencer a piece about relativism and about Socrates fighting relativism like in other words what he says is that people who are relativists think they're being all newfangled but in fact it's been around forever and his argument is that is that relativism is the norm in human thought it's these people like Socrates and Jesus who come along and say no there is such a thing as objective moral truth and Jesus said I am the truth okay and I always say that Socrates and Jesus are the twin telemon's of Western civilization a Telamon you've probably seen them are guys who hold up you know building statues that hold up buildings but they look like men right so they're the twin pillars Socrates and Jesus of our society and that is reason why is because they believed in truth the idea of relativism is the norm in human thinking okay when when Jesus said I am the truth you know I speak the truth Pontius Pilate said what is truth that was he was a sophisticated Roman guy I know that's what the Romans were thinking sophisticated people always think that they that truth is relative it's not there is a moral truth it's hard to know we approach it by half steps but it's there ultimately the thing is their ideas collapse and their ideas are self contradictory because you'll hear them say you know there's no that all cultures are the same so it's wrong all you know to condemn other cultures well if truth is relative why is it wrong why can't it just be my culture that condemns your culture you know why is it wrong that people held slaves in the South that was southern culture and of course they have no answer because relative morality is not actually relative so what I would say is hold your ground speaker speak the truth and ultimately their ideas collapse they always have in the past they will in the future all right good mailbag I wish I could go on some but I think my time is running out tickety-boo news I just I just wanted to do a whole show 45 minutes or just like things running fast and here's just a do this quickly just a point I want to make about people speaking about young people okay there's a new NBC poll and president Donald Trump and they're all they're so excited about it because it shows that Trump's approval rating amongst Millennials is terrible okay overall Trump has a 64% disapproval rating among Millennials and 21% approval amongst all a 21% approval amongst all Millennials and of course is even worse with African Americans and Asian Americans and Latinos but let me just give you another fact that has come out recently about Millennials all right Millennials Millennials kind of came of age in the during the financial crisis and a lot of them were the people we were laughing about it went home to live with their mom or went home and lived in the basements and all this stuff now things are picking up under Trump and and they're coming out and they have to get and they want to get jobs and they want to get married and they won't have lives right Millennials this is from Bloomberg Millennials are finally starting their own baby boom and heading for the suburbs in big sport utility vehicles much like their parents did Americans aged about 18 to 34 have become the largest group of homebuyers and almost half live in the suburbs according to Zillow Group data as they shop for bigger homes to accommodate growing families they're up sizing their vehicles to match US industry sales of large SUVs have jumped 11 percent in the first half of the year Ford Motor Company estimates compared with increases of 9% for midsize and 4% of small SUVs all right my point is this we played Abbie Hoffman later on Abbie Hoffman got a law degree and I remember personally I remember him being interviewed and somebody said to him you know you told everybody to drop out to get stoned and drop out but then you went and got a law degree and and Hoffman said don't hock me which is you don't leave me alone don't bother me don't bother me and of course things ended badly for for Hoffman he ended up hunted by the FBI went underground died on the road as I again speaking from memory but that's what I remember how he ended but my point is this the generation of Wall Street remember Wall Street with Michael Douglas where everybody was you know dishonest and rising and making millions of dollars the Dennett the generation of the bonfire of the vanities is the same generation as the generation of radicals same people not always the same people but some of the same people in other words people don't stay the same as they were when they were kids ignorance and youth are synonyms you know when you're young you're ignorant you have to be you can't nobody knows anything when they're young you know you but you know is you have this vitality and you have this life and you strap a sense of what's right and what's wrong maybe your parents taught you some stuff maybe your teachers taught you some stuff but you but you haven't lived you just haven't lived as you live you begin to realize that certain things have value things that your parents thought had value you thought had no value oh they were right you know was it Mark Twain said that I thought my father was a dumb guy when I was young then I grew up my father became smarter you know I think that this is what happens so all this stuff about where Millennials are going and where and it's true about races - all the stuff about the demographics are gonna destroy the Democrat Party you know they're not gonna be majority white you're not gonna be majority Christians gonna destroy the Republican Party the Republican Party's gonna be destroyed because people are gonna be Latino and people gonna be black the truth has a way of catching up to people life has a way of catching up to people people do not want to live the life that leftism offers they do not want to live that life they want to live a life a prosperity of Independence of responsibility and we can't we could lose the country countries die but you shouldn't like take these polls my only point about this is when you hear these polls you should remember that time in this sense is on your side time creates wisdom and people and when you hear what young people are talking about what they're thinking about what they're doing oh wait four years wait five years see what happens tomorrow we have the beautiful Candis Owens in studio right yeah funnily enough I always invite the really beautiful guests to come
