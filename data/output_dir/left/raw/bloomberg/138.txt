1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Take a look at the roofs of these four houses.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,160
Can you spot which one is covered in solar?

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,080
That’s actually a trick question, because
they all are.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,080
Tesla just unveiled its first-ever solar product,
and it’s stunning.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,160
Tesla's first ever  solar project is stunning

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,630
It’s not a solar panel—instead it’s
a range of four solar roofing materials that

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,930
look virtually indistinguishable from high-end
terracotta, slate, or slick modern asphalt

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,270
shingles.

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:41,640
Here’s how it works: the top of the roof
tiles is made of textured glass.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,250
It looks like shingles from most angles, but
it allows sunlight to pass through from above

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,590
and into a standard solar cell with almost
no loss in efficiency.

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:56,600
Tesla says the glass is as tough as steel,
and can weather a lifetime of abuse from the

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
elements.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,910
It can also be fitted with heating elements
to melt off snow in colder climates.

15
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,190
The price of the tiles is compelling for a
high-end roof.

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,060
Active solar tiles will cost about about $42
per square foot -- cheaper than traditional

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,720
shingles with solar panels on top.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,909
But ultimately you'll probably need more tiles
to do the same job so Tesla's total roof cost

19
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,220
will be a bit higher.

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,720
You want to call your neighbors over and say
check out the sweet roof--it's not a phrase

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,869
you hear often.

22
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:33,770
This represents the grand unification of Tesla’s
plans to become a sun-to-vehicle energy company.

23
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,080
The idea is that you can run your home on
solar power, store it in a slim battery that

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,040
hangs on your wall, and use that electricity
to power your home and car.

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Tesla also doubled the capacity of that Powerwall
battery, creating the world’s cheapest lithium-ion

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
storage to extend rooftop solar power into
the night.

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,659
This combination is perhaps the closest we’ve
ever come to affordable off-grid electricity.

28
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,560
the goal is to make solar roofs that look better than a normal roof, generate electricity,

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,250
last longer, have better insulation and actually
have an installed cost that is less than a

30
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,810
normal roof plus the price of electricity.

31
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,119
Why would you have anything else?

32
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,720
The solar roof was Musk’s closing argument
to shareholders before their vote to approve

33
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,060
Tesla’s $2.2 billion bid to buy the biggest
U.S. rooftop solar installer, SolarCity, to

34
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,410
make it all possible.

35
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,940
There’s plenty of reason for skepticism,
but if Musk can pull it off, this trifecta

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:30,349
of Tesla products: the solar roof, the Powerwall
2, and the Model 3 electric car will be available

37
00:02:30,349 --> 00:00:00,000
in Tesla stores across the U.S. by the end
of 2017.
