the notion that you're born go to school get a job retire die that's gone you're not going to do that anymore life expectancy is most likely going to be extended dramatically meaning you may very well live to 110 or 120 the notion of retiring at 65 and living to 120 there's no way you're going to be able to afford a life of leisure for 50 or 60 years the notion of retirement is gone this was the 20th century innovation it didn't exist in the 19th century and it's not going to exist in the 21st century you're going to work until you're 75 85 95 105 and don't worry about it it's not as horrific as it sounds because you're going to want to do that you're going to want to work for two reasons number one you're going to be healthy enough to do it you're going to be as healthy at age 100 as you are at age 40 or 50 and that means you're going to want to remain viable and a participant in the economy and in the community to be a valued member of the community second it's going to be easier than ever to make money thanks to the shared economy the gig economy the notion of part-time work working through the internet it's going to be easier than ever to earn a living you're not going to have to work 40 or 50 hours a week you're not going to make 100 or 200 grand a year to do it you'll be able to supplement your income twenty thirty thousand forty thousand dollars a year working on a part time basis doing whatever you feel like doing is going to be easy to make money and that means instead of waiting until you're old to retire you're going to be able to retire early and often we call them sabbaticals right now so you'll go to school you'll get a job and then you'll take a couple of years off go back to school and emerge with a totally new career and you'll do this cyclical lifeline frankly for your entire life so the notion of a linear lifeline is gone instead it will be a cyclical lifeline where you will engage in learning employment and leisure on a repeating cycle for as long as you live it's going to be fun and it's going to be enjoyable and it's going to be beneficial for the community as well what's not to love you
