so I came across a few things in the last couple of days that I wanted to mention the fold into this topic here one was a recent survey in pew which revealed that Americans are more divided now than ever before according to the survey and we're divided in terms of you know not just the number of issues that we disagree about which is basically every issue but also the severity the depth of those divisions and then second there was an article in The Washington Post a few weeks ago which cites a different survey and also argues that the so-called value divide between Republicans and Democrats is getting wider and wider and wider now I agree with those surveys I think it's kind of self-evident that this is a situation it appears to me that we have as a country we have nothing in common anymore we have no shared value we have no shared goal we have no shared sense of purpose no shared sense of tradition or identity nothing nothing about this a few months ago about our lack of shared values and our shared identity and a lot of people and I know as I say this now you're probably thinking the same thing a lot of people told me they said well we do have shared values and and those values are freedom and equality Americans love freedom and equality what are you talking about that's what we all have in common we're a free country okay first of all we are not a free country we're not hate to break it to you um and second we're only united by freedom and equality in the sense that we all like those words okay we all like to use the words freedom and equality but we do not all actually value freedom and equality okay if you look at what we consider those words to mean and how we think they should be applied you'll find that I have you know my definition of freedom and equality is about as similar to my neighbors as it would be to someone in North Korea's it's about the same you're not gonna find very many people on earth who profess to despise freedom and equality in principle but you will find a lot of people who despise it in practice and a lot of those people live in this country and some of them work for our government unfortunately now remember our our wonderful nation under God our wonderful free nation our nation of freedom legally exterminates a million children a year we have killed 60 million human beings since roe v wade 60 million so that's freedom and equality except for the 60 million we've killed I know it upsets people when I say this but no we are not a free country how dare you how dare you say anything about a free country when we've killed 60 million babies honestly how dare any of us babble on about our freedoms in a situation like that this is the worst human rights atrocity in the history of mankind and we are responsible for it as Americans while we continue to babble about our freedom I can just imagine two people in a car you know talking about oh it's so great to be free in America as they drive by an abortion clinic but it doesn't end there of course I mean that's just one example our free and equal country also happens to be one where Christian business owners as of right now Supreme Court's gonna rule on this but as of right now they can be forced to participate in gay wedding ceremonies against their will 60% of Americans agree that they ought to be forced that they ought not to have freedom of religion six percent of Americans support some version of socialized medicine over half of all Americans think that their fellow citizens should be forced to fund the abortion industry and we are forced to fund it all of us a majority of Americans believe that businesses should be forced to provide contraception to their employees and the situation gets even worse when you look at the young at the younger generations that is the generation the generation that's gonna you know that's taking over the country 40 percent of Millennials think that we should limit speech that's offensive to minorities over half of adults in their 20s don't believe in free market capitalism over 30% are avowed socialist 50 percent of Millennials would give up their right to vote if only their if only their student loans would be forgiven so get a hundred random Americans into a room and you won't find that even half of them actually care about freedom or they care about a freedom that doesn't include the unborn Christians business owners taxpayers so we don't share that principle not in any meaningful way what do we share Americans used to be united by their common belief in a Creator God from whom all rights originate not anymore America today is home to a record number of atheists a record number of empty or emptying churches even Americans who call themselves Christians which is a record of record low number of course can't come to an agreement about what being a Christian means many attend churches that have rainbow flags hanging from them where they hear about a God who who loves gay marriage and abortion that is many Christians are not actually Christian so we don't have that what else do we have I've heard some people say Americans value family we all love our families and we love family we're all you know we're pro-family the delusions of some people's it's pretty incredible and I'm almost envious of it how can we say that we all value family when we live in a country where the average family consists of three people a record low number of of women have have no kids at all or a record number of women have no kids at all I should say divorce is rampant fatherless homes are endemic in some communities the numbers as high as 70 or 80% record numbers of young people are putting off marriage or plan to never get married at all record numbers of young people say they never want to have kids at all most Americans are saving you know having kids for a point when they cannot physically even conceive kids anymore because they care more about amassing physical wealth than going on vacations and everything so family no that's that's for a great many Americans family is not even in the top three of their list of priorities so what else do we have them language we don't even have language anymore we don't even share a language so what's left nothing of substance I mean we have physical proximity we all share we you know we share zip codes with each other we share area codes with each other beyond that we have our I tell you that the one thing that we really do all have in common the one thing that binds us is our vices we all love to buy things we all love to go out on Black Friday and just accumulate a bunch of stuff that we don't need and bring it back to our houses that are filled with more stuff that we don't need so we all like to do that we're all consumerist too much TV we spend a lot of time on the Internet we love porn okay when I say we I'm talking about general you know the general American the average American this describes that person is that enough to make a country no that's enough to make a reddit community okay that's enough to make a club it's not enough to make a nation especially not a nation that was originally built upon ideals America is unique or used to be because it has a Creed it has an almost religious Creed most countries don't have Creed's we do most countries aren't founded that way they're not founded with this declaration of what we believe that's how religions are founded our country was founded like a religion and what is our Creed we all should know the Creed we hold these truths to be self-evident all men are created equal endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life liberty pursuit of happiness and that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed this is our Creed and it says that Americans believe first in self-evident objective truth Americans believe in a creator Americans believe in the inherent dignity of human beings Americans believe in the right to life and the right to Liberty Liberty Americans believe in the consent of the governed those are the six things the six doctrinal points that are supposed to hold all Americans together now I ask you how many Americans believe in all six anymore how many believe in even one of them and what happens to a nation founded on a Creed when half the country no longer believes in the Creed what happens you you know I'm not imagining things and neither are you if you ever get the feeling that you no longer even live in the same country as your fellow Americans and when I look at it I see that many Americans exist in a place where there is no God there is no such thing as man or woman there is no truth there is no objective morality babies aren't people marriage is nothing but a societal construct the whole point of life is to make money and to buy things and to go on nice vacations and the government's job is to take care of us that's the country that a lot of Americans live in and I don't relate to that country or to those people they're foreign to me I share nothing at all in common with them you know forget about shared ideals we don't even share a universe anymore we don't even share a reality anymore we cannot agree on even the most fundamental definition of what reality is okay that's how bad the division is we can't even all agree that there is such a thing as reality there are a lot of us who think that we can just make up reality as we go along and that's why we're more divided now than we were during the Civil War more divided I I've been studying the civil war for a long time it's been an interest of mine and when you read about the Civil War the thing that jumps out at you is that yeah Americans were obviously deeply divided not just over slavery but culturally there was a deep cultural division yet they still shared an essential belief in God and in truth and in virtue they still had that they applied those beliefs differently and they didn't include everyone in that belief okay both sides were filled with racists let's be honest but they still had the belief and that's why when you read you know you read about these about these stories from the civil war that seems so strange so bizarre to us nowadays but you read about these these incidents where and it happened more than once where the night before a big battle you'd have the two sides on either end of a battlefield and the night before they would meet in the middle and exchange you know they trade tobacco and they'd talk and they maybe have share food sometimes they would be dancing and all this kind of stuff and then they'd go back to their sides and kill each other a few hours later and that's what makes the Civil War such a sad story aside from the sixty six hundred thousand people that died what makes it so sad is that these were really brothers these were brothers it really was brother against brother literally in some cases but but also in the sense that these were country men they were brothers they had this there were certain ties that still bound them together and so you found there was this mutual respect yeah even while they were while they were shooting at each other and stabbing each other to death with bayonets and expend and blowing each other apart with cannonballs even in the midst of that there was still this respect between the two sides there was more respect I think on a Civil War battlefield then there is now on Twitter because now we don't have anything at all in common we don't even have that essential belief in God truth morality virtue dignity we don't even have that now we aren't shooting at each other there's no civil war breaking out and I think part of the reason for that is that the divide is not exactly Geographic and so it's hard for there to be a civil war when everyone's kind of intermingled with each other but second I think people are also too lazy for a civil war we wouldn't want to do anything that would jeopardize our ability to go home and watch Netflix at night and that's the main thing that we care about so really we're not shooting each other because we're too lazy for that and and we'd rather watch TV and maybe that will be our saving grace and that'll be the thing that that saves us from a another gruesome war like the Civil War but still the division is there hey listen I I know people will say oh you're such a pessimist it isn't that bad get out of your bubble go into the real world get off the internet go meet people people are fine in the real world they get along fine you're basing all this on the internet well let me say two things in response to that number one I live in the real world okay I'm not in a bubble and I travel the country and I meet thousands of people every year I'd probably bend about I've been to probably about 30 or 35 different states in the last two years for speaking events and yes people are basically polite to one another we basically get along okay for the most part there isn't chaos in the streets most of the time although sometimes there is but the problem is I could travel anywhere in the world and it would be the same I might avoid a place like Syria but if I went to France or China or Thailand or Australia or Mexico I could walk by people on the street and say hello and they would say hello and we'd be friendly to each other I could make Pleasant small talk if I knew the language anyway and people would be basically you know nice to each other well that's not enough to make us countrymen to be my countryman there needs to be something deeper holding us together than just mere niceties and small talk and pleasantries and I wouldn't have that deeper thing tying me to somebody in China or France and I don't have it here anymore the second thing just just quickly the Internet is the real world okay I hate this thing that people do where they say uh you know people are nasty to each other on the internet but not in the real world what do you think the Internet is do you think this is a dream you think this is a hallucination no this is real this is a real tool whereby real humans communicate with other real humans so if you're a terrible monstrous jerk on the internet that means that you're a terrible monstrous jerk in general that's the kind of person you are and if it seems like there are a lot of bad people on the internet that's because there are a lot of bad people in the world the fact that they're you know that they that they save all their badness for the Internet's then they go out and act nice in the real world that just proves that they're cowards it doesn't prove anything else other than that so yes I think I think that that even the Internet is indicative of the divisions that exist in our country and now is the part I know where I'm supposed to offer an answer people get angry when we talk about these things and and and they say oh you know what are your solutions don't just point out the bad things offer solutions well I'm sorry I don't have a five-step solution I don't have a five-step plan for how to solve our societal implosion okay I don't have that is it even possible for a civilization to pull itself back from the brink is it possible for it to go right up to the edge of destruction and then pull a u-turn and go back the other way I you know as any civilization and history ever done that before the Romans couldn't pull it off the Mayans couldn't the Mesopotamians I mean could we be the first ones ever to do that we can hope so but that certainly won't happen if we refuse to face the reality of our current situation the more that we cling to these silly slogans that nobody really believes Americans love freedom Americans love equality as long as we cling to that there's no hope for us because that means we're just gonna skip you know we're just gonna hold hands and skip right into oblivion if there is any way to stop this it has to start with accepting the reality of the situation acceptance is the right is the first step right and then once we've accepted it what's next pray the next step is to pray if there's any chance at a national revival it's only gonna happen with God's blessing God will decide and if God looks at our country and says nope you guys had your chance you screwed it up and now you're gonna reap what you sow if he says that then that's it it's over the judgment has been made but we could pray to God and beg for enough chants beg for him to allow us to turn things around I don't think we deserve that we deserve to fall apart we do but we can beg for what we don't deserve so do that and tend to your family hold your children close I don't know if we can save the entire country from collapse but I do know we can save our own families and we have to focus on that now we have to focus on shielding our children from the debris if everything does start falling apart and beyond that be vigilance because I do believe that there are tough times ahead I don't know what those tough times will look like exactly but I do believe they're coming so be vigilant and short pray for a miracle because a miracle is what it's going to take but while you're praying for the miracle and hoping for the miracle maybe in the meantime buy yourself a gun just in case alright that's it for me have a great day everyone Godspeed you
