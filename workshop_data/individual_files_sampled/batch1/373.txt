chilean catholics and immigrants from many parts of latin america spent the night here for the chance to see Pope Francis up close it was worth it I love this Pope because he underscores the need for social justice which our political parties have forgotten says cloudy nappy sorrow this is Santiago's largest park and organizers calculated 400,000 people came to the Pope's first mass in Chile less than half of the estimated 1 million who attended Pope John Paul the 2nd mass here 31 years ago during Chile's military dictatorship but those were different times back then John Paul's mass was interrupted when riot police began firing massive amounts of tear gas into the crowd to disperse those who were protesting against human rights abuses and calling for the Pope support which they got 3 decades on Chileans are still thinking about abuses but this time those committed by the church Pope Francis wasted no time confronting the issue in his first address here at the presidential palace he asked for forgiveness for clerical sex abuses against innocent miners here I feel bound to express my pain and shame and the irreparable damage caused to children by some ministers of the church I am one with my brother bishops it is right to ask for forgiveness and make every effort to support the victims many will be holding him to his word there's a lot that has to be corrected forgiveness is necessary but abusers have to be stopped forever no matter what kissing in Arizona during the mass the Pope spoke of peace before leaving to meet women prisoners on Tuesday he's in tamuka the most complex stop of his trip it's the epicenter of a restive territorial dispute by indigenous Mapuches a place where Chileans are hoping that his message of peace and reconciliation will be heard
