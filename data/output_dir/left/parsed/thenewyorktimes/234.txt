“I would build a great wall,
and nobody builds walls
better than me, believe me.
And I’ll build them
very inexpensively.”
This was President Trump’s
campaign announcement
in June of 2015.
Since then,
President Trump’s efforts
to build his
long-touted wall
have run into
political realities.
He doesn’t have the funding,
and he couldn’t
reach a compromise.
“Look, I made it so,
so clear to the president
that there is not going
to be a wall.”
And his voter base is
beginning to take notice.
“Right now, if I were
a betting woman,
I don’t think we’re
getting a wall.”
So Trump instead has tried
to use a series of distractions
to get around the fact
that his border barrier
is running behind.
President Trump had
eight wall prototypes built
near the border.
But that’s where
construction has stalled.
These monoliths stand
as a $20 million testament
to his ambitions,
but not much more.
President Trump has repeatedly
stated that construction is
already under way for the wall.
“We need the wall.
We’ve started building the wall.”
“We’re going to have the wall.
We’ve already
started building it.”
“We started building our wall.
I’m so proud of it.”
But it’s almost entirely
routine maintenance
being done on existing
sections of the wall,
plus 33 miles of new fencing.
When efforts to fund
the wall failed,
President Trump said he wanted
the National Guard deployed,
a move he said was significant.
“Until we can have a
wall and proper security,
we’re going to be guarding
our border with the military.
That’s a big step.
We really haven’t done
that before, or certainly
not very much before.”
But this is not a dramatic move.
Both President Obama
and President Bush
did the same
during their terms.
Trump suggested
the military could
pay for the wall with
part of their budget,
a proposal with few backers.
“We can’t rob money and resources
from the military that
so desperately needs them
at a time of growing
international crisis.”
President Trump said he
was willing to compromise
for wall funding in the
2018 budget bill in exchange
for protecting young
undocumented immigrants
known as DACA recipients.
“The Democrats would not do it.”
But in reality, Trump was the one
who ended the DACA program
in the first place.
Trump has tried various ways
of getting Mexico to pay,
including a border tax
on Mexican goods
or through renegotiations
of the North American
Free Trade Agreement,
also known as Nafta.
But Mexico has
yet to pay a dime.
“Isn’t it true at this
point that Mexico
is just not going to pay
for that wall?”
“I’m not going to go beyond what
the president’s already said.
I think he still has
plans to look
at potential ways
for that to happen.”
But this kind of
hedging is a far cry
from Trump’s
original promise.
“I will have Mexico
pay for that wall.
Mark my words.”
