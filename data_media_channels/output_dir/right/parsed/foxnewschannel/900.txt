>> Neil: YOU KNOW, THIS NEW HULK
CAN'T COMPARE TO THE OLD HULK.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT BECAUSE LOU
FERRIGNO IS HERE IN THE FLESH OR
HE WROTE THE SCRIPT I'M READING.
I'M TELLING YOU THAT IS THE
ORIGINAL HULK.
LOU, VERY GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
>> LIFE IS GOOD.
YOU LOOK GREAT.
>> THANK YOU.
I'M HERE DOING THE ETERNAL COMIC
CON WITH WILLIAM SHATNER.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO
COME SEE YOU IN PERSON AND HAVE
A CHAT WITH YOU, HAVE A GOOD
TIME.
NEW YORK CITY IS THE BEST.
>> Neil: YEAH.
YOU WERE THE FIRST BIG AND
BIGGER THAN LIFE REAL ACTION
COMIC HERO.
THINK ABOUT IT.
YOU'VE SEEN EVERYTHING THAT HAS
HAPPENED SINCE THEN.
YOU OVER GO WHOA?
>> YEAH, WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE
HULK SERIES, THEY HAD THREE
DIFFERENT TV STATIONS.
BACK THEN, CAPTAIN AMERICA,
SPIDERMAN.
THE HULK, WHEN I DID THAT
SERIES, IT WAS LIKE A PIONEER.
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THESE FINE
ACTORS DOING ALL OF THESE
MEGAFILMS.
>> Neil: BUT YOU WERE THE REAL
McCOY.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE
COMPUTER STUFF WITH YOU.
>> YEAH.
I'M THE ONLY GUY WITHOUT THE
COSTUME SHOWING MUSCLES FOR
REAL.
>> Neil: IS THAT AS BIG AS MARK
RUFFALO WHO PLAYS THE HULK NOW?
>> YEAH, HE'S A GOOD ACTOR.
>> Neil: HE IS GREAT.
>> BILL BIXBY WAS MY FAVORITE.
>> Neil: HE'S A CLASS ACT, AS
ARE YOU.
DO YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THESE
MOVIES THAT HAVE COME OUT
FEATURING BIGGER THAN LIFE COMIC
STARS, ONE AFTER ANOTHER?
I CAN'T KEEP TRACK.
MY KIDS CAN.
>> YEAH, I MISS THE OLD FILMS.
SOMETIMES LIKE -- EVERY EPISODE,
THERE WAS A MESSAGE.
BUT NOW, GUYS JUMPING OFF
PLANES, SHOOTING WITH TWO GUNS.
I MEAN, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?
>> Neil: 30, 40 YEARS TOO SOON.
YOU WERE AHEAD OF THIS WAVE.
>> YEAH.
IT'S THE WAY -- EVOLUTION.
>> Neil: YEAH, A LOT OF THESE
GUYS ARE GETTING $20 MILLION A
PICTURE.
>> I KNOW.
>> Neil: I DON'T WANT TO GET YOU
ANGRY.
>> I'M HAPPY.
I'M DOING MY OWN THING.
I MENTIONED TO YOU CALLED
"PUMPED."
LIKE THE CELEBRITY APPRENTICE OF
FINANCE AND BODY BUILDING.
PEOPLE BRING THEIR BRAND TO THE
SHOW.
IT'S ON DISCOVERY, LIFE CHANNEL.
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE THAT HAVE
DISABILITIES.
THEY WANT TO BRING IT TO THE
SHOW, MAKES THEM FEEL BETTER
THAN THEY ARE.
LIKE ENTREPRENEURS.
IT'S HARD FOR THEM.
>> Neil: I THINK IT'S A GOOD
IDEA.
YOU MENTIONED THAT
APPRENTICE-TYPE MOTIF.
YOU AND THE PRESIDENT ARE QUITE
CLOSE.
YOU'RE ON HIS FITNESS COUNCIL.
>> YES.
I WENT THERE A WEEK AGO.
WE'RE COMING UP A PLAN.
WE HAD A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE.
I WANT TO MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY.
>> Neil: YOU GO A WAYS BACK,
EVEN DURING THE CAMPAIGN, ONE OF
THE FEW CELEBRITIES SAYING YEAH,
I LIKE THE GOOD, WOULD WITH A
GOOD PRESIDENT.
A LOT OF --
>> HE HAS HIS PROBLEMS.
I FOCUS ON MAKING AMERICA
HEALTHY.
I'M NOT A POLITICAL GUY.
AS A PRESIDENT, RESPECT HIM.
I PEOPLE THINK IT'S EASY.
YOU HAVE TO SIT IN THAT CHAIR.
RESPECT OUR PRESIDENT.
YOU HAVE OBAMA, OUR PAST LEADER.
RESPECT HIM.
>> Neil: NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE.
>> YEAH.
>> Neil: YOU'RE BUSY TODAY.
BUT WHEN THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT
ON THE NORTH LAWN TODAY AND HE
WAS TALKING TO ALL OF THESE
JOURNALISTS, TAKING QUESTIONS
FROM EVERYBODY, AND A LOT OF
THEM ARE IN YOUR FACE.
WHAT DID YOU THINK?
>> IT'S TOUGH.
HE HANDLED IT VERY WELL.
EVERY DAY THEY BEAT HIM UP.
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
IT'S A TOUGH SITUATION.
HE'S DEALING WITH ALL OF THESE
WORLD AFFAIRS LIKE NORTH KOREA
AND IMMIGRATION.
IT'S TOUGH.
I THINK HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.
I FEEL SAFE WITH HIM AS A
PRESIDENT.
>> Neil: SO YOU DON'T THINK
SOMETIMES HE CAN BE SENSITIVE TO
THE CRITICISM?
HE SHOULD LET IT GO AWAY.
>> NO.
PUT YOURSELF IN HIS SHOES.
THE MEDIA IS TOUGH.
I'D RATHER BE THE DEPUTY
SHERIFF.
>> Neil: IT'S TRUE.
I READ ABOUT THAT.
IN THAT ROLE, DID YOU EVER STOP
SOMEONE FOR SPEEDING AND DID
THEY SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT?
>> THEY SEE ME AND THEY TRY TO
RESPECT ME.
I WANT THROUGH THE ACADEMY 15
YEARS AGO.
MY FATHER WAS AN NYPD
LIEUTENANT.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED WITH
LAW ENFORCEMENT.
I WENT THROUGH THE ACADEMY AND I
WANT TO GIVE BACK.
IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU GET
OLDER,DOWN WANT TO GIVE BACK.
>> Neil: NO, YOU'VE DONE A LOT
OF GOOD, ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS.
HOW DO YOU KEEP IN TRACK?
>> DO 30 MINUTES OF CARDIO AND
30 MINUTES OF WEIGHT TRAINING.
THE MOST IMPORTANT IS WHAT YOU
EAT.
>> Neil: WHEN YOU SAY WEIGHT
TRAINING, DOES IT COUNT IF
YOU'RE CURLING SUBMARINE
SANDWICHES OR NO?
>> NO.
HAVE TO KEEP IT SEPARATE.
>> Neil: I UNDERSTAND.
SO HOW DO YOU POLICE WHAT YOU
EAT?
>> AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A
BALANCED DIET, I STAY AWAY FROM
UNREFINED SUGARS.
YOU CAN HAVE A CHEAP MEAL BY
STAY AWAY FROM COKES.
>> Neil: SO YOU EXERCISE EVERY
DAY.
SOMEONE SAID YOU'RE NOT ABOUT
THIS.
NO MATTER WHAT, YOU DO IT EVERY
SINGLE DAY.
>> YES.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CONSCIOUS OF
EATING HEALTHY.
>> Neil: I WORK OUT TO.
>> I WAS 43 WHEN I CAME BACK TO
COMPETITION.
>> Neil: I DON'T CARE.
I'M LOOKING AT THE PERSON ON THE
LEFT.
THAT'S MY DOING MY ORIGINAL
HULK.
I'M NOT CHANGING OUT OF MY SUIT
AND GOING ON AIR.
THE STAFF KEEP THEIR DISTANCE
THERE.
>> WHAT ABOUT CONSISTENCY?
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
SOME DAYS I DON'T WANT TO GO TO
THE GYM.
IT'S ABOUT MAKING THE EFFORT TO
DO IT.
THAT'S WHY WITH THE COUNCIL,
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO DO IT SO
MANY KIDS WITH OBESITY.
HEAD PHONES, TEXTING.
GET THEM INVOLVED IN SPORTS.
WHEN TRUMP PICKED THESE PEOPLE,
IT'S HUGE.
WE NEED THAT FOR THIS COUNTRY.
>> Neil: I NEED YOU TO TALK TO
MY SONS.
>> I WILL.
>> Neil: THIS COULD GET UGLY.
