1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,150
COMEDIAN AND HOST OF THE FOOD
NETWORKS TO ENORMOUS FOODS HAD

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,570
INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY ON

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:12,709
TWITTER ABOUT BEING PERSECUTED
AS A STRAIGHT WHITE MALE.

4
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:15,669
I DO WANT TO PUT WORDS IN HIS
MOUTH, I WILL HAVE YOU GUYS

5
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:23,849
READ HIS TWEETS WITH ME.

6
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:33,320
>>NO DIFFERENCE IN THE USAGE.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,980
NONE.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,149
WELL, DO WE HAVE TO REALLY POINT
THIS OUT?

9
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,750
THIS GUY STARTED IT,

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,510
THE N-WORD IS WHAT THEY WERE

11
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,309
USED BEFORE LYNCHINGS AND
DURING SLAVERY.

12
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,969
I DON'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
JOSH DENNY WAS ENSLAVED, OR

13
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:58,980
SPLIT UP HIS FAMILY, OR RAPED
HIS WIFE WHICH WOULD HAPPEN

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,000
OFTEN DURING SLAVERY.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,500
HE HAS A TELEVISION SHOW BUT HE
IS SLIGHTLY BOTHERED WHEN OTHER

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,350
PEOPLE USE THE WORD STRAIGHT
WHITE MALE.

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:20,430
>>LET'S READ A LITTLE BIT MORE.

18
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:30,720
HIS FIRST TWEET WAS SO
OVER-THE-TOP.

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,040
COMPARING STRAIGHT WHITE MALE TO
THE N-WORD IS CRAZY.

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,909
IT TOOK AWAY ANY LEGITIMATE
POINT HE MIGHT HAVE IN FOLLOWING

21
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:40,909
TWEETS.

22
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:43,890
I HAVE SEEN THIS AND I DO
THINK IT IS UNFAIR.

23
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,560
SOMETIMES THERE WILL BE A
STRAIGHT WHITE GUY TRYING TO

24
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,150
MAKE A POINT AND SOMETIMES HE
WILL GET DISMISSED.

25
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,500
I DON'T THINK THAT IS FAIR.

26
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,000
BUT TO SAY WE ARE BEING
PERSECUTED, AND IT IS RACISM AND

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,369
IS EQUIVALENT TO WHAT PEOPLE'S
EXPERIENCE, YOU LOSE LEGITIMACY

28
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,470
IN ANY ARGUMENT YOU ARE TRYING

29
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,590
TO MAKE.

30
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,400
>>I
DON'T THINK HE SHOULD BE FIRED.

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,800
>>ME EITHER.

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,730
>> PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO
START THESE CONVERSATIONS AND

33
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,880
SOMETIMES THEY MAKE TERRIBLE

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,490
MISTAKES WHICH I THINK JOSH
MADE IN THIS CASE.

35
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,500
IF WE BASICALLY DO A CAREER
DEATH PENALTY FOR THESE

36
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,960
MISSTEPS AND EVERYBODY WILL BE
AFRAID TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,770
AND WE WILL NEVER GET TO
DISCUSS THESE THINGS.

38
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,960
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE
HORRORS OF SLAVERY.

39
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,910
WE DON'T TEACH THE TRUE HORRORS
OF IT BECAUSE SOME THINGS ARE

40
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,370
SO UNCOMFORTABLE WE LEAVE THEM
OUT OF OUR HISTORY BOOKS.

41
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,340
>>ALSO YOU READ ABOUT LYNCHINGS
IN HISTORY BOOKS BUT YOU DON'T

42
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,970
REALLY READ ABOUT LYNCHINGS.

43
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,900
I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE HAVE
EVER LEARNED ABOUT HOW GRUESOME

44
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,060
THOSE LYNCHINGS WERE.

45
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,870
>>THE USED TO HAVE PICNICS ABOUT
THEM AND TAKE PARTS OF THE

46
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,730
BURNED BODIES AS SOUVENIRS.

47
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,730
BY THE WAY THAT IS NOT ALL
THE GORY DETAILS.

48
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,320
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT HIS FRIEND,
IAN Ã± HE INCLUDED HIM IN ONE OF

49
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,100
THE TWEETS.

50
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,800
IAN IN MY OPINION HAVE THE
BEST RESPONSE.

51
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,290
HE SAID, " TO BE FAIR YOU KIND
OF EMPLOYED HYPERBOLE SEWED

52
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,841
GRANDIOSE THAT COMPLETELY
OBSCURES ANY POINT YOU MAY HAVE

53
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:34,400
BEEN ATTEMPTING TO MAKE, YOU
BEING TOLD TO SHUT UP IS NOT THE

54
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
SAME AS A STRAIGHT WHITE PERSONS

55
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,370
OF OPINIONS NOT MATTERING."

56
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,790
THAT
IS ANOTHER GREAT POINT THERE AT

57
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,720
THE END.

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,240
NOBODY IS ACTUALLY SETTING YOU
UP, THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT

59
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,770
LOCKING YOU UP.

60
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:54,850
GUYS, DON'T ATTACK HIM FOR THAT.

61
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,520
LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION.

62
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,230
>>A DIALOGUE.

63
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,230
YES.

64
00:04:00,230 --> 00:00:00,000
>>HOPE THIS LEADS TO SOMETHING
PRODUCTIVE, BUT IT HASN'T YET.
