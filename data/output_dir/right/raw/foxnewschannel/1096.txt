00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:12,450
>> Greg: DO A GOOGLE SEARCH

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,457
FOR -- GOOGLE'S WORK WITH

3
00:00:19,457 --> 00:00:25,229
PROJECT MAVEN.

4
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:26,630
GOOGLE HAS PULLED OUT OF THE

5
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,032
PROJECT UNDER PRESSURE FROM

6
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:29,033
THOSE WORKERS.

7
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:30,234
APPARENTLY DOING ANYTHING

8
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:31,836
CONNECTED TO THE MILITARY WHICH

9
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:33,938
PROTECTS THE LIVES OF THOSE SAME

10
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:35,139
PASTY WORKERS ARE GOOGLE'S VAN

11
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:36,874
FOR THEIR BRAND.

12
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:39,443
GOOGLE, YOU KNOW IT IS BAD FOR

13
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:40,144
YOUR BRAND, YOU.

14
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:41,645
YOUR MOTTO USED TO BE DON'T BE

15
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:41,946
EVIL.

16
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:43,814
IS AND WHAT YOU JUST DID KIND OF

17
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:44,281
THE OPPOSITE.

18
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:46,584
YET WHILE DECIDING NOT TO HELP

19
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:49,220
OUR MILITARY WITH THEIR AI, YOU

20
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:49,854
INVEST FORTUNES INTO OTHER

21
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:50,654
COUNTRIES AI.

22
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:52,323
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY ARE GOING

23
00:00:52,323 --> 00:00:53,858
TO DO WITH THAT?

24
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:54,859
D-DAY BEING YESTERDAY, THAT'S

25
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,060
THE OPPOSITE OF GOOD TIMING.

26
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,461
I'M NOT GOING TO CALL YOU

27
00:00:57,461 --> 00:00:57,862
TRAITOROUS.

28
00:00:57,862 --> 00:00:58,863
YOU ARE SCARED.

29
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:00,030
YOU ARE SCARED BECAUSE IN THIS

30
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,799
DAY AND AGE COME AMONG YOUR

31
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,702
HELPING UNCLE SAM IS HELPING THE

32
00:01:04,702 --> 00:01:05,069
OPPRESSOR.

33
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,938
OH, YOU LOVE THE WEALTH BUT NOW

34
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:08,839
DISMISS THOSE WHO ENABLE AND

35
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:09,473
PROTECT IT.

36
00:01:09,473 --> 00:01:11,075
HOW REMOVED YOU BECOME FROM THE

37
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:12,343
IDEAS YOUR PARENTS AND THEIR

38
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:14,278
PARENTS AND THEIR PARENTS FOUGHT

39
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:14,545
FOR.

40
00:01:14,545 --> 00:01:16,780
THE DECISION GOOGLE MADE IS ONE

41
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,681
OF COURSE THEY CAN MAKE.

42
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:19,650
BUT IT'S FOOLISH AND HARMFUL.

43
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,252
AS DRONES BECOME AN INEVITABLE

44
00:01:21,252 --> 00:01:23,988
PART OF THE DEFENSES, AND OUR

45
00:01:23,988 --> 00:01:25,256
ENEMIES OFFENSES, GOOGLE MADE A

46
00:01:25,256 --> 00:01:25,623
CHOICE.

47
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:29,026
MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THE SAME.

48
00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:32,196
DANA, IT DRIVES ME CRAZY.

49
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:34,632
IT'S HARD, YOU CAN'T SAY I'M NO

50
00:01:34,632 --> 00:01:35,266
LONGER USING GOOGLE.

51
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,667
BECAUSE THEN I'M GOING TO GOOGLE

52
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:40,437
OTHER OPTIONS.

53
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:40,738
BEING.

54
00:01:40,738 --> 00:01:41,739
DOES THINGS TO WORK.

55
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:49,046
>> Jesse: I USE ASK JEEVES.

56
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:50,014
DOES THAT STILL WORK?

57
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:50,848
>> Dana: GOOGLE IS A HUGE

58
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,849
COMPANY.

59
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:54,385
IT'S NOT JUST A SEARCH ENGINE.

60
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:55,119
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS

61
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,456
THAT ERIC SCHMIDT, HE IS ON THE

62
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:01,392
DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE ADVISORY

63
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:03,260
BOARD.

64
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,262
BECAUSE HE IS VERY CONCERNED

65
00:02:05,262 --> 00:02:06,864
ABOUT, ESPECIALLY WITH CHINA AND

66
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:07,565
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND

67
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:08,666
WHAT IT COULD DO TO OUR FUTURE.

68
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,835
IF YOU WANT TO BE SAFE AND

69
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:14,138
PROTECTED AMERICA, THEN YOU

70
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:15,139
PROBABLY SHOULD HELP OUR

71
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:15,506
MILITARY.

72
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:17,041
>> Greg: SCHMIDT IS NO LONGER

73
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:17,675
THERE.

74
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:19,476
THEY ARE SELLING STUFF TO CHINA.

75
00:02:19,476 --> 00:02:21,078
THEY ARE WORKING WITH CHINA,

76
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:21,412
GOOGLE.

77
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:23,847
>> Jesse: I AM AFRAID TO

78
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:25,249
CRITICIZE GOOGLE BECAUSE THEY

79
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:27,251
MAY LEAK MY SEARCH HISTORY AND

80
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:28,052
THEN I AM TOAST.

81
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:29,853
>> Kimberly: WHY DID YOU SAY

82
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:30,287
THAT OUT LOUD?

83
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:31,689
>> Jesse: IT IS A WEASEL MOVE.

84
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:35,426
YOUR HELP IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE

85
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:37,628
YOU REDUCE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.

86
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:38,295
DEFENSIVELY, TERRORISTS ARE

87
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:39,029
GETTING ACCESS TO DRAWN

88
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:39,463
TECHNOLOGIES.

89
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:42,166
YOU WANT TO DEFEND THEM AGAINST

90
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,033
THAT.

91
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:44,835
AMERICA, IN A SICK WAY, IS

92
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:46,070
ALMOST TOO SAFE.

93
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,838
WORLD WAR I, WORLD WAR II,

94
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:48,639
THREATS WERE EVERYWHERE.

95
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,940
DOMESTIC ATTACKS, PEOPLE ARE

96
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,041
GETTING SHIPPED OVERSEAS TO

97
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:51,609
FIGHT FOR A COUNTRY.

98
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:54,845
WE ARE SO FAR REMOVED FROM THAT,

99
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,480
WE DON'T HAVE THE SENSE OF

100
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,548
PATRIOTISM AND NATIONALISM THAT

101
00:02:57,548 --> 00:02:57,948
WE USED TO.

102
00:02:57,948 --> 00:03:01,352
WE CAN AFFORD TO LET THESE

103
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:02,920
THINGS LIE DO NOT PROTECT THE

104
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,588
NATION LIKE IT USED TO BE

105
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:05,256
PROTECTED.

106
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:06,223
>> Kimberly: WE NEED TO BE

107
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:07,958
MORE WORRIED ABOUT CLEAR AND

108
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,860
PRESENT DANGER IN TERMS OF AN

109
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,629
IMMINENT THREAT OR ON HIGH ALERT

110
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:12,663
ABOUT SOMETHING TO SAY WE REALLY

111
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:15,165
DO WANT TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

112
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:16,066
TO KEEP OURSELVES SAFE, LIKE

113
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:19,670
AFTER 9/11.

114
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,571
THEY HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO BE

115
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:22,172
ABLE TO SAY I AM OPEN TO THIS

116
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:24,074
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS

117
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:26,076
DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

118
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:29,480
SO THEN IT RUNS THE RISK OF TIME

119
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,814
PASSING, MAYBE PEOPLE BECOME

120
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:33,651
COMPLACENT AND HE FEEL TOO SAFE.

121
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:35,085
>> Greg: THEY ARE A BUSINESS.

122
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:36,754
WE TALK ABOUT BUSINESS CAN DO

123
00:03:36,754 --> 00:03:37,488
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

124
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:39,456
THE NFL CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT.

125
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:40,858
GOOGLE CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT.

126
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:42,793
THE NATURE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS

127
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:45,663
DESIGNED TO REDUCE COLLATERAL

128
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:46,063
DAMAGE.

129
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:47,197
WHAT CAN BE THERE ARGUMENT OF

130
00:03:47,197 --> 00:03:54,271
THE THEY WANT TO BE APPEARING

131
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:54,538
PC.

132
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:55,673
>> Juan: IF I TOLD YOU I WAS

133
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:57,041
GOING TO INVENT SOMETHING THAT

134
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,677
ALLOWED FOR CONSTANT

135
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:01,078
SURVEILLANCE BY ARTIFICIAL

136
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:01,812
INTELLIGENCE, I THINK GENERALLY

137
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:03,147
GREG WOULD SAY NO.

138
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:06,083
>> Greg: I WOULD BE FOR IT.

139
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,184
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

140
00:04:07,184 --> 00:04:09,453
I WOULD HAVE DRONES IN MY HOUSE

141
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:10,854
IF I COULD.

142
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:12,656
>> Juan: IS THAT RIGHT?

143
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:15,693
>> Greg: I MIGHT ALREADY.

144
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:17,528
>> Kimberly: LITTLE DRONE MAN.

145
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:22,031
LITTLE DRONE MAN.

146
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:23,901
>> Juan: I AM SAYING WHEN YOU

147
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,803
THINK ABOUT THE IDEA THAT YOU

148
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:28,172
ARE EMPOWERING DRONES TO HAVE

149
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:29,073
THE KIND OF FACIAL RECOGNITION,

150
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:30,474
BODY RECOGNITION.

151
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:32,643
YOU THINK WAIT A SECOND.

152
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:33,277
WHERE IS PRIVACY?

153
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:34,912
WHERE ARE MY RIGHTS AND

154
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:36,146
PROTECTIONS AS AN INDIVIDUAL?

155
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:38,982
YOU CAN SAY IT MAKES OUR DRONES

156
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:39,483
MORE EFFECTIVE.

157
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,852
I THINK IT STARTS REALLY, HOW

158
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:42,853
WOULD YOU SAY, ESCALATING.

159
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:44,621
THE BAD GUYS GET IT AND SUDDENLY

160
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:46,457
WE ARE IN TROUBLE.

161
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:48,926
THAT'S WHY I THINK, SO YOU ASK

162
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:49,860
ME.

163
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,462
IF IT'S ABOUT MILITARY, I AM ON

164
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:53,197
YOUR SIDE BECAUSE I WANT OUR

165
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:55,065
MILITARY TO BE STRONG.

166
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:55,766
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT

167
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:57,835
EVERYTHING SHOULD BE IN THE

168
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:58,469
MILITARY'S HANDS.

169
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:59,570
I DON'T THINK THAT.

170
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,504
>> Greg: IT'S GOING TO BE IN

171
00:05:00,504 --> 00:05:04,041
SOMEBODY ELSE'S HANDS.

172
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:04,875
>> Dana: THE CHINESE

173
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:05,576
MILITARY'S HANDS.

174
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:10,848
>> Juan: THEY DON'T HAVE THAT.

175
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:13,050
>> Dana: I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY

176
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,185
CAVED TO 4,000 EMPLOYEES.

177
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:15,853
>> Greg: MAYBE THEY SHOULD

178
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:17,087
RETURN TO THE CAVE.

179
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:18,522
THERE IS NO GOOGLE IN CAVES.

180
00:05:18,522 --> 00:00:00,000
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT
