1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,670
I have had zero positive experiences.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,029
I go to the bathroom and I pull out my phone,

3
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:05,460
and he has texted me,

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,710
“I hope you’re enjoying your peecess.”

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,240
It may seem like there couldn’t be a worse
time to be alive and single.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,260
And then texted me asking me if he could come
home with me.

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:21,340
Just a slew of, like, poor dates, and, like,
mediocre dates, and s***ty dates.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,560
But the truth is that for as long as it’s
been around, dating has always sucked.

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,440
It’s the late 1800s.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,120
These are the presidents.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,260
This is how people dress.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,220
This is the music they listen to.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,720
And this is how single people get together.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,800
I see you’ve already chosen your corner.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,960
Better known as “calling,” it’s the
predominant mode of courtship among the middle class.

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,500
The basic setup of calling was that a woman
would have hours when she was receiving callers

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
at home.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,500
This is Moira Weigel.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,110
I’m a junior fellow at Harvard University
and the author of a book called Labor of Love:

20
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,970
The Invention of Dating.

21
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,259
The basic script is that a man shows up at
your house,

22
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:08,709
asks whether you will see him,

23
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:12,729
and then you sit together in a parlor and
sort of spend time together,

24
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:17,159
with either direct or sort of from-the-next-room
family supervision.

25
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,600
Sounds super hot.

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,069
At the time, 75% of Americans lived in small
towns or on farms.

27
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:24,979
If you think meeting someone at a bar is tough,

28
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:27,539
try finding a spouse in a town where you'd
only encounter

29
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,600
a handful of potential partners in your lifetime.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,259
And while it may seem like the way we date
is dictated by things like love and affection,

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,180
it was actually driven by something far less
romantic:

32
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:45,369
In America in the 1880s, 1890s, you have these
floods of migration both from the countryside

33
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:46,369
to the city

34
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:48,630
and from other countries to the United States.

35
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,149
As the country industrializes, urban populations
explode.

36
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:56,500
The population of New York increases seven
times between 1850 and 1900,

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,469
and Philadelphia’s goes up 12 times.

38
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,169
You only have people going out into public
spaces and meeting and mixing in this way

39
00:02:03,169 --> 00:02:04,369
that we call dating

40
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:07,539
once you have lots of young people moving
to cities

41
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:11,810
and especially women entering the paid workforce.

42
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,870
Many women step outside their homes to work
for the first time,

43
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,940
and that gives them exposure to potential
suitors in a way they never had before.

44
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,900
Courtship shifted from something that happened
in private, tea and supervised small talk

45
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,950
in your home,

46
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,780
to activities that happened in public:

47
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,969
going to restaurants, movies, and amusement parks.

48
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:32,540
From that point on, in order to meet somebody,
you had to spend money,

49
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,680
and dating became entangled with the economy.

50
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,440
After World War II, the American economy flourished.

51
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,189
Between 1940 and 1960, the GDP soared from
$200 billion to $500 billion.

52
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:50,180
The economic boom after World War II in the
United States means that young people have

53
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,110
much more disposable income than they’ve
ever had.

54
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,440
By 1956, there were 13 million teens with
an average income of $10.55 per week.

55
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,400
That’s the same amount of disposable income
an entire family had 15 years prior.

56
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,280
And they wanted to spend it.

57
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:09,180
Unlike previous generations that were expected
to help support their families,

58
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,100
this new generation had time for leisure and
recreation.

59
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,939
This consumer-driven period was about affluence,

60
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,890
and the dating scene closely reflected that
economic prosperity:

61
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,109
shiny new cars, rock ’n’ roll, drive-in
movie theaters — and don’t forget about

62
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:25,060
going steady.

63
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,370
There was no looking back after that ...

64
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,670
a disposable income and access to technology
democratized dating for decades to come.

65
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:40,400
We’re riding on the internet, cyberspace
set free, hello, virtual reality.

66
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,420
Access to the internet meant access to more
people.

67
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,599
From 1995 to 2005, the number of internet
users worldwide increased from 16 million

68
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,430
to almost 1 billion.

69
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,760
As with every previous era of dating history,

70
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,980
there's sort of this new economic sphere,
and romance and flirtation becomes part of

71
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,980
how it gets commercialized.

72
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,459
So chat rooms about sex or the opportunity
to flirt with people online is a big part

73
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,150
of what's appealing about AOL.

74
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,029
By 1999, there were already 2,500 dating websites.

75
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:17,019
But the big moment came around 2010, when
mobile phones started changing the way people

76
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:17,739
connect.

77
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,079
Because in the ’90s, I think there's still
this sense that the internet is sort of, you

78
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,079
know, it’s cyberspace.

79
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,610
It's this other universe that lives in your
desktop and that you go to sometimes and chat

80
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,819
with a stranger.

81
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:32,919
Once everyone is carrying a computer on their
person at almost all times and our physical

82
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,110
and digital lives are interwoven, that really
changes the dynamics.

83
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,699
It’s no surprise that dating piggybacked
on this explosive growth.

84
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,729
Dating apps, dating apps, dating apps.

85
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:48,360
According to a recent survey, 77% of Americans
own a smartphone and 15% of American adults

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,569
use dating apps.

87
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:55,880
Grindr launched in 2009, Tinder in 2012, and
now there are hundreds of dating apps to choose from.

88
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,140
So meeting new people has never been easier.

89
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,940
But does that make us any happier?

90
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,240
Dating is kind of a necessary evil.

91
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,139
The thing about online dating is that you
don’t trust anyone.

92
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:11,229
You get to pin your top hate or like, and
this guy “hates abstinence.”

93
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:16,440
Every new technology, every new kind of social
practice, inspires anxiety

94
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,620
about how folks are meeting and pairing up.

95
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,229
So dating still kind of sucks.

96
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
But that’s nothing new.

97
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,940
My name's Tian, I'm gonna be 25.

98
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,200
I'm looking for someone who...

99
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,700
comes from a long line of European nobility.

100
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,200
Absolutely, that is critical for me.

101
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Someone whose family has land holdings

102
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,260
across, ideally, the south of France.

103
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,380
And will take me vacationing in their summer castle.

104
00:05:51,620 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm interested in going to bed early, to wake up even earlier.
