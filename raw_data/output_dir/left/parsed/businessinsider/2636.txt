-  Hooters Air
puts the fun back into flying.
(record scratching)
-  Wait a minute.
-  Hooters
girls on every flight.
-  Hooters had an airline?
-  All leather
seats with extra leg room.
Call 1-888-FLY-HOOT.
-  You might not
have known about Hooters Air
because it didn't last long.
- Fly Hooters Air!
- There you go.
-  It started in 2003,
and initially the airline was successful,
but it shut down just three years later.
- We're at the Gary Chicago
International Airport
where Hooters Air is about
to make their maiden flight
to Myrtle Beach.
-  Based in Myrtle
Beach, South Carolina,
it offered low-price direct flights
to more than 15 destinations in the U.S.
Air fares were a flat rate
of $129 dollars each way.
So why did Hooters
think it was a good idea
to start an airline, and why did it fail?
- If you like what you
see here on the outside,
you're gonna love what
you'll see on the inside.
-  Hooters was
founded by six business men
in Clearwater, Florida in 1983.
A year later, an Atlanta-based
group led by Bob Brooks
saw the company's potential
and bought it outright.
- It was the first "breastaurant" chain.
So basically they pioneered the idea that
they're going to have all their
waiters where short shorts
and really tight tank tops.
- Do you know why our beer
is so cold here at Hooters?
Because we keep it in the refrigerator.
- From kind of the '80s
until the early 2000s
it was a very successful
kind of growing business.
-  By 2003,
Hooters was flushed with cash
and Bob Brooks wanted to expand the brand,
so he bought a small North
Carolina-based charter airline
called Pace Airlines.
He repainted the airplanes
with the company logo
and Hooters Air took off.
- What would you tell people
out there watching the show
about flying Hooters Air?
- You should definitely do it.
It's an experience like no other.
- How about yourself?
- It's gonna be the most
exciting time of your life.
-  I'm probably one
of the few pilots who can say
I actually went to "pilot heaven."
-  This is the voice
of a former Hooters Air pilot.
He asked to remain anonymous.
- There was a lot of
intrigue about this airline
not because of necessarily
what was going on on the inside
but more so what people
perceived from the outside.
- It's gonna be a nice
change from the restaurant.
Instead of serving food and all that stuff
and picking up trash, we get
to just basically entertain,
ask trivia questions and all that.
-  A common
misconception about Hooters Air
was that the flight
attendants on the flights
were Hooters girls.
Not exactly.
In addition to the two
Hooters girls on every flight,
there were three FAA-certified
flight attendants.
-  The flight
attendants are the ones who
serve all the food and
the drinks, per usual.
I had a professional uniform.
I had like a navy blue dress.
You know, it was very professional.
It had the little owl
embroidered emblem on it.
-  We just
did the safety procedures
and stuff like that.
And then we had two Hooters girls
from different restaurants in the area
but they had no training whatsoever.
They were just there
just for passenger fun.
- What is it all gonna include?
You guys are gonna be up
there serving customers?
- No wings.
- No wings.
- But great food.
- But great food.
- Yeah, we got some soft pretzels
and we got some like pigs in a blanket
and you know, maybe some ...
fruit, you know.
-  The two Hooters girls
would get up during the
flight and do trivia
or little games or sing a song.
I think they just sat in
their seats the whole time
until it was their five minutes
to get up, and that was it.
The rest of the time us
flight attendants are working.
-  Were
there ever any incidents
that you witnessed of harassment
or customers getting a
little too inebriated?
-  I never
saw any kind of harassment.
There was definitely flirtiness.
Any flight, you're always
gonna come across some people
that have drank too much, but nothing bad.
It was fun, we did our job right.
It was just very happy memories.
-  Fares from $99.
Convenient morning departures
and evening returns.
-  Hooters Air
helped out smaller airports
like the one in Gary, Indiana,
just 25 miles southeast of Chicago.
- It's good news, more airline
service, more activity,
more economic development, more jobs,
more people spending money
in northwest Indiana and ...
- Good news.
- Southern Chicago, and so
it's very good news, yeah.
-  And it was
a major economic boon
to one city in particular: Myrtle Beach.
- In its heyday Hooters Air
was bringing between 3,000
and 5,000 people a week
into the Myrtle Beach area.
Hooters Air was more than just an airline.
It was a huge philanthropic contribution
to the Myrtle Beach area by Mr. Brooks,
who had a vision that
the Myrtle beach area
could grow and expand and evolve
as a tourism destination
and a business community.
-  Hooters Air
was big for Myrtle Beach
but it wasn't enough to keep it airborne,
so Hooters shut it down in
2006, citing a $40 million loss.
- It was compounded by
a couple of factors.
They started the airline
still as the airline industry
was recovering from the 9/11 attacks.
People were still scared
of getting on airplanes.
There was growing low-fare
competition in the market
as Southwest and other
airlines had begun to expand.
And jet fuel prices were trending upward.
So it just wasn't an
economically viable business.
-  Hooters chairman
Bob Brooks passed away
in 2006, the same year
that Hooters Air shut down.
- There are people at
work and people enjoying
the Myrtle Beach area
that might never have had
the opportunity to do so if
it weren't for Bob Brooks,
so we remain very grateful
for his investment
in his airline and our community.
-  Despite the
failure of Hooters Air,
the Hooters brand continue to thrive.
- They've opened hundreds
of locations in the U.S.
and outside of the U.S.
They are more than a
$250 million business,
basically, at this point, and they kind of
took over the U.S. and then the world.
-  Often times, going into cities,
we'd be on an approach and
we'd hear the air traffic controller say,
"Do you have the Hooters
airplane in sight?
"And if you do, follow that aircraft."
Well, other pilots would
often say things like,
"You mean the airplane
with the big hooters?
"We have it in sight."
So, um ... (chuckles)
