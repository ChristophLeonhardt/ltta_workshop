hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle the in rapid succession Donald Trump will attend a meeting of NATO leaders then meet with Russia's Vladimir Putin what can we expect from the Donald and much much more on this edition of crosstalk crosstalking Trump goes to Europe I'm joined by my guest mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Aric Krause he's an independent political risk analyst and in Athens we cross to Alex Christopher oh he is the director and writer for the duran dot-com all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means it can jump in anytime you want now he's appreciated Eric let me go to you first here it's been building up the hype here we have Donald Trump saying that trade with the Europeans is about as bad as with the Chinese that's a very interesting comment and of course NATO was shaking in its boots it's never had an American president come to one of these annual conferences in the Alliance interesting times to live in Eric yeah Trump is making politics interesting again it's very difficult to predict exactly what he's going to do is that his strategy yeah it is certainly a strategy to keep people off balance and he does have a plan that what I think he's going to do is very similar to what he did with Kim he is going to come in they're gonna cut some sort of a deal and we don't know what it is I don't really what Trump can with the Russians can give Trump would perhaps be a decrease in the role of Iran in Syria that is within mr. Putin's gift and it's something he could probably do does he have any reason to trust mr. Trump no he doesn't but he needs to he wants probably to strengthen it's Trump's position visa vie the anti-russian establishment don't you think that would back but let me go to Alex and Athens you know Eric what Eric is bringing up here is really interesting because if any concession is made then it's considered appeasement but if you want to have some kind of diplomatic parlay you have to compromise it's a very vicious circle Alex yeah it is and I think that Trump has been boxed in obviously by by the whole Mueller investigation and and everything that's been going on for the past two years but but I think he's confident about his trip going to Europe and meeting with Putin let's not forget he had a rally in Montana and Great Falls Montana I believe it wasn't and he was speaking pretty openly about his upcoming trip whether it was to NATO or whether was meeting with Putin he even said that you know everything's going to be fine and we may actually get along so even though he has a lot of stuff domestically that's that's tying his hands up he seems like he's handling it pretty well and he's pretty confident about it he met he met with Kim who's the devil incarnate so I mean by comparison things for Markus is it you know I think number one he thinks this Mueller reports gonna result in nothing okay because if there was something it would have been leaked number two it's baked in criticism of him meeting Kim in criticism of meeting Putin it's already baked in the worst possible things you could have said about Trump these would be either these two other leaders I mentioned it's already been said yeah I mean I mean first of all it's obvious that the the Russia gate witch-hunt as a resulted in a big big fat zero the investigation announced with their their biggest single movement forward with the manna fort you know they're getting him on obstruction or indictment on obstruction of justice and other charges tax evasion they admitted that there is absolutely nothing against metaphor that has anything to do with collusion with Russia or the election they admitted that openly so that's going nowhere but you know people who are making noise about Trump ear first of all Trump has a great deal of animosity with the European leaders you know we've talked about versus or personal they campaigned openly against them they meddled in US politics they openly and many of them openly endorsed Hillary Clinton the others used their state media relentlessly to attack Trump this is a little bit of payback he doesn't like them and he's making it personal Trump cannot stand me me that's a real strong I don't think he called Merkel his best friend either so she's the leader of the free world remember that that's what the Obama people she's lucky she's the leader of Germany at this point she's just hanging on by a thread you know for me you know all this hoopla about you know Trump and NATO I I think the a more rational more sober view of this is first of all he wants people to pay their fair way that's pretty fair but he's asking him to reimagine the Alliance a quarter of the century after the end of the Cold War and the reason that existed in the first time I I think if people had an honest discussion about what its role should be because you know what they would the 5000 bureaucrats that run NATO they can imagine no outside of discussion of its role because it doesn't have a role it is there to keep the Western world free of a Russian invasion you might as well spend all this money to keep the Martians from taking watch we completely disagree and and secondly there is a very strong economic driver here and mr. Trump is a traveling salesman and the American arms manufacturers are the strongest export industry and he wants the Germans to spend lots and lots of money to keep Lochhead and McDonald's in business okay so this is this is a this is the puzzle he wants to put together if they spend more money they'll buy American disagree I disagree completely that NATO has no purpose of course its purpose has nothing to do with the Cold War and very little to do with Russia now I am a veteran of the US military including of NATO ops I've seen firsthand NATO has never been used in state in self-defense against the state enemy that that is so the illusion that it is a defensive collective security alliance is hogwash all right it's complete absurdity NATO has in the post Cold War era NATO has become a tool the preferred tool of u.s. global military because it's a it's a fig leaf it is a political figure if militarily it has no real teeth right it is a political figure appiah none trees on board behind the u.s. the latest US regime change well the interesting go to Alex I mean the only real meaningful military player in NATO outside of the United States is Turkey and things are going - well in that direction here I mean the interesting thing is is that you know if we look compared Russian defense spending to American defense spending American defense spending is to make a lot of people a lot of money a Russian defense spending is to protect the country okay and I tend to agree with with Eric right here that this is a money-making enterprise NATO go ahead Alex yeah and let's not forget that the people in the EU the the leaders of the European Union and the government's there have been have been skating by without having to allocate any of their of their budget towards the NATO spending in towards NATO defense I mean I think you only have eight countries that fulfill that percentage goal and we what is Greece and why fifty billion in debt Greece spend money on NATO like other countries they're afraid of their NATO ally Turkey okay but because the deal signed with Germany to bail them out include strictures that they have to purchase arms from Germany and France okay they are obligated by the contracts they have signed for that for their bailout deals to buy weapons that they do not need from German are you think that well the Trump jugger knot I think I need to copyright that because I'm using it a lot now is is this is this a way for NATO to reimagine itself if it's being given an ultimatum by Donald Trump the leader of the Alliance by far would that make European members of NATO reassess Russia's threat I think that they have been it's they have amazingly successful in keeping the Europeans on side you'll notice that these sanctions were renewed with no protest from Italy we don't know what happened behind we don't know what happened behind closed doors its Russia is not the number one issue for any European state they all have their own problems right now so thus far there just has not been the political courage to break now at some point Trump is going to push his luck a little too far with the Europeans and they may have to we're up on their hind legs would that be something bad it would be an excellent thing and it's something I have been waiting for personally for the last 20 years France has become a appendage of the United States and said embarrassment and at some point yes we would expect that NATO I mean with NATO the fundamental problem here is it is hard to justify hundreds of billions of dollars of military spending to waste terrorists in the desert whereas Russia can provide a credible threat if you want to ignore all the evidence and just look at the military power of Russia then yes you need hundreds of billions of dollar weapon and airplane programs so Russia provides a really useful scarecrow yeah okay and I go back to Alexei in in Greece is what role what does Putin get out of this meeting with Trump well good because that's for me a wild card okay I mean I would say that the Russians have continued to practice much to the chagrin of a lot of people strategic patience with the West particularly in the United States now we're gonna see it on display go ahead Alex well I think Putin gets some breathing room I mean I think we've just passed eight years of Obama and and the tension between the US and Russia was was ratcheted up to to a cold level 12 and so I think by meeting with with Trump he's going to get some breathing room maybe Trump will give some concessions on sanctions maybe something will be toned down a little bit maybe some of the rhetoric of course government-to-government rhetoric I don't think the media is gonna ever let up on on Putin or on Russia but he gets some breathing room and I think he's already scored a couple of victories I mean it's being held in Helsinki that's close to Russia it's it's not being held you know closer to the US Trump is coming out to see Putin so I think he's already scored some victories and and I think it's it's showing that Putin is a player in that Russia is a pleasure I'm gonna give mark the last 40 seconds in this block here what would a successful summit mean mark yeah well one European diplomat observed anonymously two foreign policy that a no news summit would be a win for them but that they are scared in expletive I mean Putin has all rest of all Trump had said Russia should be back in the g8 without asking Russia if it wants it they didn't ask and secondly he is be seems to be willing to discuss the situation in Crimea which is absolutely unprecedented you have may screaming about isolating Russia you have a Merkel who's like a deer in the headlights and then suddenly you have the leader of the free world it looks to me he might want to be friends with Putin but he's showing his intense hatred for the rest we're gonna get a jump in here gentleman we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on some real news stay with arty welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle to remind you were discussing some real news okay gentlemen let's change gears I'd like to just highlight an article that I read in consortium news calm by Daniel Lazar the topic title corporate media's about-face on Ukraine's neo-nazis now I know we talked a bit a little bit about this last week but I thought it was very interesting that his article is a very good review on how Western media pushed this narrative that these are freedom fighters in Ukraine that there was no coup and now we have some of the main broadsheets foreign policy Washington Post the Atlantic Council of all people backtracking on it I mean Eric what does that mean to you I mean I spun a narrative which just doesn't work anymore then the neo-nazis in Ukraine have become so egregious and so open that you simply can't hide it anymore they're not trying to hide it the Atlantic Council is for God's sakes the mouth space of the of neighborhood Eric who did they Atlantic Council invite to speak to them mark and Draper Ruby and Ruby is a neo-nazi he is a banderite neo-nazi he was the co-founder of the social Nationalist Party and another intuitive he was also the leader of the self-defense forces of the Madonn which of course went on to seize buildings and kill policemen and fought the new regime into power on the streets of Kyiv he is now the Speaker of the Rada the number three person in the Ukrainian government he met with the u.s. Speaker of the House congressman he's already met with the Canadian Parliament Justin Trudeau and he is a neo-nazi there's no question about it here's what the deal is you know with these Ukrainian groups which are funded and armed by the Ukrainian government they're all even doing children's outreach and indoctrination generated into the military and parallel police force right they've started attacking Roma camps they've started anti-semitic attacks things that can't be covered up here's the blunt truth when these fascists right we want to call them ultra nationalist you want to call them the extreme right wing when these banderite fascist militias that are integral to the Ukrainian regime getting into in keeping power when they were just killing ethnic Russians so Vox East Ukrainians and communists in East Ukraine it was all fun and games that's what they were there for and no one in the Western media or government scared they applauded them on ok it seems to me that this in a way plays into Trump's hands as he goes to NATO and talks to Vladimir Putin is that if the the the the the lid is out off the jar about what's really going on Ukraine there's not much reason for Donald Trump to go to bat for Ukraine after all he says that well the Russians in Crimea like being part of Russia I mean it's that kind of a way for him to kind of take that off the table a bone of contention go ahead Alex yeah I think it is a bone of contention and going back to what we were talking previously about NATO and and some of the leaders of Europe who trusted who Trump does not like let's not forget that Ukraine was I think the biggest donor for the Hillary Clinton campaign and poroshenko clearly was behind Hillary Clinton he was outspoken about it but going back on I'm very joyful looking at you exactly and going back on a Marx point real quick let's not forget that that three four years ago the the fake news media was calling real neo-nazis in Ukraine conservatives and moderates but today in the United States they call anyone who's for open borders who's for traditional family values whatever they call them a neo-nazi well I mean there's a that's a political term that is so misappropriated in the West and overlooked in a country like Ukraine real quickly China have any of these fine media actually thanked RT for covering the story first so it's a backhanded and you know this headline doesn't come from as I remember has been banging on about this tree we had on this program yeah but you know I've been face should thank you okay I want to thank you for something else you are an expert in economics in political risk Donald Trump says you could win a trade war it's easy yeah now Russia and I'm sorry United States and China are going to head-to-head from what I understand though that the exports from China to the United States is only 19 percent of their total exports I mean is this all political is this all domestic politics here is it is it the midterms you can win a trade war the same way you can win a nuclear war it's it's mutually assured destruction the economies are simply too integrated there are too many Chinese components going into American products in American press the entire global supply chain has been very much integrated and you have some sorcerers a parenthesis here playing with hand grenades now I don't know to what extent they're faking but if they push it too far you're going to cause a delay okay but the emitter our politics is always today an immediate mark is this about American domestic politics and Trump's hope the stem a red tide in November yeah yeah even a Trump's economic team as neoliberal and clueless as it is understands that no one except possibly for Russia or China there wins out of this you're not going to recover American jobs in the Rust Belt with with a trade war you'll you'll gain some with steel and lose some with auto manufacturing right there's always a blowback this is all about domestic politics this is this is all about showing that he's doing something about the problem of globalized trade to the Rust Belt workers in Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin that helped get him elected the Chinese know that that's why they've targeted their counter tariffs specifically against the stay rational districts are in this game perfectly but in the long term I disagree Russia China are gonna win this trade war as are other countries because what this is going to do is it's gonna make other countries increasingly move away from the dollar as a fiat currency it's gonna speed up this whole process they're gonna get arational quickly before it ever happens right Alex let me go back to you in Greece here I tend to think it's more political it's a feel-good topic and remember this is what Trump said on the campaign I need to stress this over and over again I've said he has this envelope in his pocket on the back of it he's got all of his campaign promises and he checks the moxa as it goes along he's very fanatical about that and I think I think at the end of the day is Eric's pointed out I mean no one really wins a trade war in the short term maybe we can talk about the dollar later but I mean Trump's going to the it's a politics of motion he's doing it again yeah yeah no one knows how far Trump is going to take this or how far China's gonna retaliate but you know it sure makes for a good speech when Trump goes to you know those rallies and he fires up the base so I think you know he's definitely the we've definitely seen a US president that is going through a list of promises that he made however controversial they are however detrimental they may be to the US or to the world but he's checking them off or at least he's he's pretending or or saying or acting like he's checking them off and and it's rallying up the base and it's rallying them up for those 2018 midterms you know Eric one of the things I've been thinking about it because we were 18 months into drums presidency as he changed the world enough and American politics enough that he's already created a legacy because the Democrats and the Liberals they're just hoping you put in one of their guys and we go right back to where we were this a nightmare of 18 months then it'll be four years and they'll go backward and I think I think they're they're deceiving themselves because I think Trump not hit himself specifically and maybe not any one of his specific policies but he set a new tone and tenor for politics particularly in the Western mister is wonderfully non hypocritical at least for once you do not have American dominance which you got with Obama who could spin the worst policies with his caring and sharing language Putin Trump comes out saying we are the biggest dog on the block and we're gonna bite and he is he has torn away the veil and my point is again that the Europeans are going to gradually have to come to the understanding that no you cannot rely upon the Americans for everything that we are in France we are on our own and should be a good thing which should be an excellent thing I think the area era of American hegemony which is not necessarily particularly good for Americans as is coming to an end and this is going to be a very difficult and a very disruptive process if you look at 1914 the end of the all the Empire and the Ottoman empires this was not a gentle I want to give mark the dissenting voice here go ahead yeah first of all Trump's apocrypha about just about everything he said on foreign policy he's attacked Syria he was adamant time and time again about the u.s. role in Syria and aiding jihad he's bombing the country and so on he attacked Hillary Clinton for Saudi Arabia and he's if anything crawled even further at least pushed Hillary over on Mohammed bin Salman's bed so he could make room for himself in there he's continued democratization regime change programs it just came out this week that he is pushing his administration towards overt military regime change in Venezuela yeah we're out of time here Alex I just stay kind of thumb in the air here it looks like the North Koreans are pushing back on the presumption that they're going to do exactly what the Trump administration wants is this is it is this just part of the parlay cuz I think it is I think it's part of the parlay where everyone's fighting out the Americans are going to find out that they're dealing with a a negotiating partner that knows what it's doing one minute it's yours Alex a tough negotiating partner but I think more interestingly you're going to see the the liberal establishment mainstream media you jumpin joy oh they are that Trump Trump hasn't been able to seal the deal with North Korea and it's not turning out so smoothly as as he was you know proclaiming it to be and so I think you're gonna see the mainstream media actually happy about this outcome even though I think we have a long terrified of peace okay ten seconds here I mean basically Trump is going to negotiate with mr. Putin they're going to come up with some kind of a deal Trump is going to announce a great new step forward a new victory for American interests in keeping America safe and his electorate it's gonna love it's going to announce the new Trump order gentlemen that's all the time we have here many thanks to my guests here in Moscow and in Athens this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk rules all right now for the extended version of our program we have political potpourri well I'm going to start myself on this this segment here Nova Chuck 2.0 that's all I have to say Eric this is Conn this has become theater of the absurd it's it's hallucinatory it now appears that the Russian side is knocking off British junkies the the is that a moral problem funny thing where do the two Wheatley that latest victims have in common with the last two they both live within about 15 miles of I'm not massaging of the largest British chemical warfare facility somebody has butterfingers there and it's not mr. Putin who doesn't really have to eliminate English junkies butterfingers martes so let me see oh you're we're wiping off nova John yes this is the British government officially a previous self-defense mechanism against the super-secret Soviet nerve agent that is ten times more power okay now via Alex baby white you can't you can't see it marks using baby wipes Irish government I think I can shake your hair now without being infected here I'll excite you keep going on this because I've watched the the reaction of it of course in the in the UK it's a head lighting but in the rest of the world most people aren't even reporting it because people are saying you've got to be kidding me I think after yesterday's match with England going to the quarterfinals I don't think they even care about this narrative let's not forget that it was Boris Johnson and Theresa May who were going to boycott the English team from going to the World Cup in Russia and now they're coming out this 2.0 nova choke thing the minute where the the English team is doing so well playing football in Russia so I don't think they could care if they do a nova truck 2.0 3.0 4.0 it doesn't matter the English people couldn't care they're focused now on something totally different that's happening inside of Russian it's something that's good and positive and I think it's it this is dead in the water this is May tried to block the English team from playing she would end up hanging I think they had mark who said that she would end up hanging from a lamppost someplace in front of the House of Commons you know the funny thing is is that you see you know microns gonna be watching the game you saw the the Croatian president yesterday with Medvedev but no one in the UK no.1 in the UK is allowed to see now the English team play in the quarterfinals so Alex see what you're saying alex has said all of these attempts over the last four years to isolate Russia is isolated to resume yeah she can't go to the match Johnson nor clerk in any of the Royals boycotted it what we met I mean many has been going on about this super isolate Russian narrative and then the next day Trump comes out and says what Russia should be in the g8 and and we have to rethink the situation in in in you in in you know in Ukraine and Crimea in Crimea and she's being left to hang out to dry and she still can't you Briggs it looks like about the halls in this whole second story all right the supposed to tour targets are a couple they are known drug addicts ready or jump they are homeless all right they no one reported on this story for four days four days which I had led to the suspicion that there was a D notice forbidding the press from reporting on it the police first reported it as a a case of a drug overdose right they then tried to cover up the story during the next few days with telling residents that there was a gas leak which there obviously wasn't during the night in question the the swim that it will chair Fire and Rescue tweeted out in a response there they were responding to this incident thankfully the incident was not serious and our decontamination showers weren't needed I they used baby wipes instead and the tweet was then deleted there are so many holes in this story there's one sane man left in the under British Isles and this is Simon J still at the Guardian and he just it's amazing it actually got printed there and he asked where is the evidence against Russia just like the first Nova case there is still not one iota of real evidence okay and these accusations possible motives I Alex but what happened to the scribbles what happened to them this cat this was the biggest domestic terror attack on the UK since who knows when why don't we hear about it anymore they vanished if Peter vanished that was it's that simple well it was such a no he knows so no one talks about it such as we talk about it such a deadly nerve agent that it left them alive let's review the score as of this moment the score is Nova Chuck zero British victims five if you don't count the guinea pigs and the cat that the British government starved to death in the scribbles house but none of them are dead the cat in the pit of the guinea pig Nova truck zero British Alex Alex what do you think about this I mean I mean the level of skepticism now I mean every I mean Tresemme has to be the worst prime minister in modern history okay I mean is this her last final waltz to try to get people scared because that's the only thing she's using his fear to stay in power I mean I would expect a palace coup within the Tories to get rid of her now yeah it's amazing that no one's just pulling her aside and just telling her to stop I mean it's it's it's looking so bad for her it's so embarrassing for her and for Boris Johnson if you know Alex I think you solved it I mean if she goes to Boris Johnson can become Prime Minister that's what people threatening to fire him now they have nobody else to put in its place it's a little like with Merkel they're scared to death to get rid of Merkel because they lose any political stance with situation they have and the the left wins so they can't they cannot sacrifice me at this pool to be fair late the dominant narrative in the British media about this is not that Putin is trying to exterminate you know British homeless drug addicts two by two but that this is just leftover see it turns out that one of what yeah it was left over well it turns out one of the victims is a known dumpster diver right he loves diving in trash so their story is that somehow miraculously this this nerve agent which we all know it degrades very well at least according to the experts important down the degrees very quickly very quickly right it must have been laying in the dumpster for four months exposure to weather had no effect on it natural deterioration no effect and that's that's how this happened well I think personally that shows that the UK has a far far bigger program problem than nova Chuck if the dumpsters in don't get emptied for four months you've got a much bigger problem expertise in this area okay because I think like most of us that are interested in this when they talk about chemical compounds and their reactions and reactions I have to say I don't know much about it give us your the organophosphate agents block the neuro of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter channels they are very potent insecticides they're used very widely in chemistry in in agricultural chemistry they're used in pharmacology they're very common compounds I could mix up a batch in any college laboratory in a fairly short period of time they make very good nerve agent very good chemical warfare agents except chemical warfare agents are utterly useless basically nobody uses them because of the problem of blowback you don't know who you're going to boys and with them including yourself including yourself and they've mostly been abandoned base a lot of research was done now to claim that this whatever new agent could not be cooked up by any competent chemistry student is nonsense do you think they you think that is this you know we had chemicals of mass destruction with with Saddam we have alleged chemical attacks in Syria and I'm still gonna say alleged chemical attacks in the UK because I personally have not been given any evidence Alex I mean this is kind of the this is kind of like this alien virus that you know nobody understands how it works it's always with you and it can tack at any time I mean is it's a perfect weapon because most people it's eric has just explained to us most people don't understand how it works so it's easy to do it the Popular's that they create fear a political moment of an exist engine see where they can do anything they want doesn't question go ahead Alex it creates fear but but the way they execute the the narrative is so sloppy so close so without a motive or evidence that that's not so easy to put the buck and tear it apart and let's not forget we also had another chemical incident that was debunked at least the preliminary reports show that was debunked that was the the chemical listed in Douma and the OPCW also says that they found no traces of sarin gas etc so baaad but that's not what the media narrative is mark champagne okay so the OPC interim report it's not the final report it came out and this is about this chemical attack incident in Douma which was being held by the army of the self-proclaimed the Army of Islam Jaish al-islam and they claimed they were hit by a chemical attack and backed up by the US normal us Gong goes right the official interim report is out and it says that there were no organophosphates which means all of the news from the US government the British government about sarin nerve agents fake news you lie alright the other thing they said is that there was detected some trace amounts of chlorinated organic chemicals which means essentially that a PVC pipe could have been hid right maybe chlorinated what until we know trace amounts it doesn't say anything about a chemical weapon attack a chlorine bomb attack anything like that that's not the way the Western media reported it Bibi right Duma attack was chlorine gas Washington Post global watchdog concludes chlorine was used daily beast chlorine was used in serious chemical attack Reuters interim OPC fun cases even a list of the all fake news they all had to correct those stories within hours complete disinformation complete lying Western media elite contains a finish up on the air here again I'd like to reiterate they they're using this path of Terror terrorizing the public is because they can get away with it yeah and the question which nobody seems to ask is why is it moral to blow people to smithereens with smart bombs or to shoot holes in them but not to guess them why is there something particularly diabolical any more diabolical you know American wars with NATO is a fig leaf you know they take more children away from their parents well yes and any ice officer south or north of the Mexican border that's all the time we have here we hope you've enjoyed the extended version of our program we'll see you next week and remember crosstalk rules
