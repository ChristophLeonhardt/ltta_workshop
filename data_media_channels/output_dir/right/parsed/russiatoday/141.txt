but you know what I don't like about
it's not that I don't like what I what I
need Saturday Night Live to improve on
or what I need the Liberals to improve
on is if he don't look good we don't
look good this is our president he has
to be the freshest the fliers the flying
planes the best factories and we have to
make our core be in power we have to
bring jobs into America because our best
export is entertainment ideas but when
we make everything in China and not in
America then we're cheating on our
country and we're putting people in
positions to have to do with legal
things to end up in a cheapest Factory
ever the the prison system I'll tell you
what that was pretty impressive you know
I hate to say this Jim you want to say
something
you
