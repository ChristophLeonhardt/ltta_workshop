you're shorter at night than you are in
the morning when you look in the mirror
in the morning you're actually taller
than you we're the night before this is
due to pressure you put on your joints
all day long walking running and other
physical activities cause very small
compressions in the cartilage in your
spine gravity plays a part too
flattening the intervertebral discs when
you finally lay down in bed your body
can relax easing the pressure in your
spine making you about one-and-a-half to
two centimeters taller
there are ways you can reduce the stress
on your spine throughout the day some
people suggest yoga or pilates two to
three times a week the routines help
improve your posture and can help you
retain up to an inch of your height
