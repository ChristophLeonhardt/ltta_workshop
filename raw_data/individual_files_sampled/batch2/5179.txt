we Giuliani is firing back at White House insider reports that President Trump is frustrated with his headline-grabbing media blitz creating confusion and potentially legal vulnerability for mr. Trump Giuliani telling NBC's Kristen Welker today the president is encouraging him to do more TV interviews and that the president is very comfortable with the strategy that they are pursuing joining me now is Roger stone a longtime Trump confidante former Trump campaign adviser and author of the new book stones rules how to win at politics business and style Roger welcome good to see you again thank you very much for having me I was wondering what you think about the Rudy Giuliani media blitz he says that it's working a lot of reports credible reports including our own Christian workers that the president is not happy about it and wants him to check his facts get things straight or else might lose confidence in him what do you think I have not heard that from credible sources around the president I think it is fair to say that mayor Giuliani is a very tough guy and right now I think the president needs a tough leader on his legal team I also think that listening to his interview with judge Jeanine on Fox which was mostly focused on the broader questions of the of the special counsels inquiry its legality its actions and so on I think he's done an excellent job his handling of the Michael Kohn stormy Daniels matter I found a little disjointed meaning I had trouble following largely what he was trying to say I'm not an attorney but I don't believe mr. cones payment just an opinion is illegal I don't know about the issue of reimbursement but beyond that I think that he has done a good job of getting the focus on the fact that we don't have a special counsel law in place the three-judge panel that would normally overlook the expansion of an inquiry doesn't exist mr. Rosenstein therefore assumes that authority he has a prior association with mr. Muller he refuses to share information with the co-equal branch of government violation of the separation of powers this is very troubling and I think Giuliani has done a good job of illustrating a lot of these issues for the American people well mr. Rosen Stein has shared a lot of information but there is privileged information that should not be shared about targets of an investigation but what he says is that what he says is it would expose national security and that I find curious in itself I think it's ready for what the Congress can demand transparency let me but the fact is that Rudy Giuliani has exposed the President to possible legal questions because he's contradicted the president's past statements the president's emulation he's just new to this he'll get his facts straight all that said should the president now sit down with Robert Muller should he give him give an interview I have thought that he should not frankly that question with that opinion was magnified when I read that New York Times of front-page piece I'm curious as to how that leaked I don't buy the claim that it came from one of the Trump lawyers I don't believe that's true but the nature of those questions the structure of those questions one of them admittedly pertaining to me I find troubling they were a perjury trap this was quite obviously an obstacle course for the president try to pick through without making some misstatement look I don't think there is any evidence whatsoever a Russian collusion or conspiracy or coordination not with the Trump campaign or with Donald Trump or his associates so now he appears to be looking at other matters since to Justice Department's both Republican and Democrat have ruled that a sitting president cannot be indicted then the only purpose of this inquiry has to be removing Donald Trump from office in other words undoing the results of the last second let's talk about the Russian connection because there have been you know a number of instances with man afford with others with you know Jared Kushner and others meeting with Russians talking to Russians Papadopoulos you know there are plenty of connections we don't know about collusion but we certainly know that there have been conversations and connections with you know key figures have first of all have your own connections you said in October on two occasions in October the third and the fifth that you had that WikiLeaks was going to go after Podesta then two days later the Podesta email is don't stop you injury I never said any kind in fact well you said you have total confidence that WikiLeaks and my hero Julian Assange yes so educate the American people and lock her up and then on October 5th you tweeted payload coming lock them up and then two days later the Podesta email drops so what else were you referring to coincidence let's go back to the previous tweet which is crucial I said the the Podesta's apostrophe s should have been asked they tell me time in the barrel will come I was referring to the Podesta brothers there shady Russian business dealings haven't been fully reported in the Panama papers in April in 2016 they have come to my attention in an opposition research memo mana Ford is being roasted for his activities in Eastern Europe mostly being fed to the media by Clinton operatives yet Tony and his brother are there in plain sight and that is what I was predicting by the way those stories and and the Podesta's business dealings gas banking so on were reported later by The Wall Street Journal by Bloomberg so time in the barrel refers specifically to public scrutiny I never said anything about the coincidence that two days later voila the Podesta emails dropped of course only you know within minutes of the Access Hollywood tape now the Wall Street Journal the answer question is yes that would that would be based on conjecture supposition but but there is no evidence that would suggest that that is what I was speaking to I never said anything of the kind The Wall Street Journal reported last month in an email that they obtained on August 4th 2016 that you wrote I dined with my new pal Julian Assange last night is that true well it's true that they reported that I've addressed this in the Washington Post and numerous other networks let's make it clear sam nunn Berg was working for Donald Trump and I was working with him when Sam wood worked with you he would sometimes call you 20 and 30 times a day is quite neurotic a one late one Friday when I was trying to get him off the phone he said you have plans for the weekend and I said I think I will fly to London and dying with Julian Assange The Washington Post miss quotes what I actually said you were joking it's it stick please now my passport customs records airline records the security cameras at the Ecuadorian Embassy my hotel bill my airline bills to Los Angeles and a receipt from Izzy's diner on Santa Monica Boulevard would show you that I was not in London that weekend and could not have met with Assange and to anticipate a follow-up question no neither by Skype or phone either now you've had no contact with the Muller people no inquiry from them to have a conversation I'm sorry I because the earpiece I lost your thought you have have the Muller people been in touch with you at all I have not been interviewed or been contacted by the special counsels office and you were not a go-between with gusoff er with WikiLeaks or anybody else at any time that is correct I mean again I don't buy into the premise that gusoff er is indeed a Russian asset I think that is unproved just because MSNBC and Mike Pompeo the former Secretary of State and former CIA director unfortunately with it unfortunate that they are agents of a foreign service yes which is Russia right the evidence mr. Pompeo that's that our intelligence agencies have been politicized this is in my opinion an open question there's vigorous debate on it on the Internet goose' 42.0 whoever that is is using software that is registered to a person who works at the Democratic National Committee the number of of counterterrorism IT experts and a great piece published by the nation question whether the DNC was other hack - whether the information was the purloined information was taken out the backdoor through some kind of portable computer drive so it is unproven at best but in all honesty it's irrelevant because my only 20 forward communication with him happened six weeks after WikiLeaks has already published the the snow the allegedly hacked emails consequently I could not have colluded with him to do so it's chronologically impossible and I made that exchange on Twitter entirely public who would conduct international espionage on Twitter so you disagree with Mike Pompeo the Secretary of State and former CIA director mr. brass and mr. Brennan in mr. clapper I think Julian Assange does what you do he is a journalist and when he finds what he believes to be authenticated as the truth he prints it just as you do we can't celebrate the Washington Post's publication of classified documents in the Vietnam War and say that we should jail Assange for publishing classified documents that expose misdeeds of the government and have you spoken to the president recently when was the last time you talked to him I have not spoken to him recently but even if I had it would not talk about the contents of our conversation the last time I spoke to him which is a while ago he was very upbeat he was very positive this idea that he's angry or rattled I've seen no evidence of it I've known him you know almost 40 years he you know when the president calls you in all honesty he does most of the talking you do most of the listening as you know and he was very upbeat on the economy 3% economic growth and so on Roger stone thank you very much thank you and our apologies for that earpiece sorry that's okay we made it work thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
