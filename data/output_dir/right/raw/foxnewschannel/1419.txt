1
00:00:01,766 --> 00:00:02,300
POSSIBLE DIRECTION.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,067
LELAND: HEARING WHO HAD TO YOU

3
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:04,602
THE U.S. MILITARY IS TRYING TO

4
00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:06,137
COUNTER THE CHINESE THREAT.

5
00:00:06,137 --> 00:00:09,307
GILLIAN TURNER, THANKS SO MUCH.

6
00:00:09,307 --> 00:00:11,242
ELIZABETH: AFTER CALLING OFF THE

7
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:12,577
ANTICIPATED SUMMIT WITH NORTH

8
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:14,412
KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN, THE

9
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:16,581
PRESIDENT SAYS IT COULD BE BACK

10
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:17,048
ON.

11
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:19,150
HERE TO DISCUSS IT AND OF

12
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,922
COURSE, THE POLITICAL

13
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:25,623
RAMIFICATIONSES, DEMOCRATIC

14
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:27,592
STRATEGIST, AND BRIE, START WITH

15
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:27,892
YOU.

16
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:28,659
NORTH KOREA OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN

17
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:30,661
ABLE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF

18
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:31,963
REWARD THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS

19
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:33,364
ON A GLOBAL SCALE FOR GOOD

20
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:35,900
BEHAVIOR FOR A STEP IN THE RIGHT

21
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,334
DIRECTION.

22
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:37,969
DO YOU SUSPECT THAT'S MOTIVATION

23
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:40,338
FOR THE JUNE 12TH SUMMIT TO

24
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:41,272
ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE?

25
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:42,273
>> I DEFINITELY THINK SO, BUT

26
00:00:42,273 --> 00:00:43,908
YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER KNOW WITH

27
00:00:43,908 --> 00:00:45,610
NORTH KOREA, THAT'S THE THING.

28
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,112
AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR

29
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:48,980
DONALD TRUMP TO HAVE CANCELED

30
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,982
THE SUMMIT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

31
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:52,783
NORTH KOREA WAS REPORTEDLY

32
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:54,652
THREATENING TO HAVE A NUCLEAR

33
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:56,387
SHOWDOWN WITH THE UNITED STATES

34
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:58,222
IF THE MEETING DIDN'T GO WELL.

35
00:00:58,222 --> 00:00:59,690
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN

36
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,558
ENTERING A NEGOTIATING TABLE TO

37
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:01,959
BE HONEST AND FOR US TO ENTER

38
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,227
WITH THE POSITION OF STRENGTH,

39
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:03,694
RIGHT?

40
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:05,630
I MEAN, THE REALITY THAT NORTH

41
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,199
KOREA IS A COUNTRY THAT IS

42
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:10,334
IMPLODING INTERNALLY AND THEY

43
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:12,904
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DEVELOP

44
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:14,372
EFFECTIVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS,

45
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:14,705
RIGHT?

46
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:16,807
SO I THINK WE NEED TO ENTER THE

47
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:17,675
NEGOTIATING TABLE BEING HONEST

48
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:20,711
WITH ONE ANOTHER AND NOT

49
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:22,280
TREATING THEM IN THE POSITION AS

50
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,016
THEY ARE IN AND US ENTERING WITH

51
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:25,449
STRENGTH.

52
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:26,751
I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

53
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:27,652
AND I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP

54
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:28,920
UNDERSTOOD THAT AND I WAS

55
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,521
HONESTLY, I MEAN, HAPPY TO SEE

56
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:32,890
THAT HE ENDED UP CANCELING THE

57
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,759
SUMMIT WHEN NORTH KOREA WAS

58
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,595
ENTERING WITH THAT TYPE OF AN

59
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:37,962
ATTITUDE.

60
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:40,765
ELIZABETH: ROBIN, AND OBVIOUSLY,

61
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:42,366
YOUR LAST NAME, YOU YOU'VE BEEN

62
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:44,335
ON THE SHOW BEFORE, I APOLOGIZE.

63
00:01:44,335 --> 00:01:47,305
AND SECOND OF ALL, I ASSUME YOU

64
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:47,939
DO NOT AGREE.

65
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,942
>> BRIE BROUGHT UP VERY GOOD

66
00:01:50,942 --> 00:01:52,510
POINTS AND MY MAIN CONCERN, WITH

67
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,245
THIS BEING ON JUNE 12TH, THERE

68
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:55,112
WERE SO MANY MOVING PARTS TO

69
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:57,248
THIS, YOU KNOW, IT'S TAKING ME

70
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,283
BACK TO MY ACTIVE DUTY DAYS,

71
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:00,551
KIND OF SHOOTING MOVING TARGETS

72
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:01,352
HERE AND I DON'T THINK WE HAD

73
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:03,454
ENOUGH TIME TO PUT THIS

74
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:03,854
TOGETHER.

75
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:07,658
AND I THINK IT'S A SMART MOVE TO

76
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:09,627
DELAY THIS AND DONALD TRUMP

77
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,362
DOESN'T LIKE TO EXPOSE HIS

78
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:14,265
PLAYING CARDS.

79
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:16,467
BOLTON DID NO SERVICE TO HIM BY

80
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:17,601
HIS COMMENTS WE WERE GOING TO

81
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:18,703
USE THE LIBYA MODEL.

82
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:21,238
I KNOW IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF

83
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:23,007
CONTEXT, BUT THE PERCEPTION FROM

84
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:24,909
KIM JONG-UN WAS CERTAINLY HE WAS

85
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:27,144
GOING TO END UP LIKE GADHAFI,

86
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:29,246
DEAD ON THE MEAT FACTORY FLOOR.

87
00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:32,216
>> IF WE SEE KIM JONG-UN MAKE A

88
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:33,784
MORE AGGRESSIVE STANCE AS HE DID

89
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:35,252
WEEKS AND MONTHS AGO, THEN WHAT

90
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:36,253
IS MY QUESTION?

91
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:38,422
IF WE SEE HIM SORT OF, YOU KNOW,

92
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,024
MEETING WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN

93
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:41,792
PRESIDENT AND THERE'S EFFORTS

94
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,394
FOR IT TO TAKE PLACE, BUT THAT

95
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:45,129
COULD CHANGE, SO THEN WHAT?

96
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:46,263
>> IT CHANGES ALL THE TIME, BUT

97
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:47,264
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE

98
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:48,232
TWO OF THEM IN THE PAST.

99
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:51,202
YOU KNOW, THAT THE NAME CALLING,

100
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:54,138
THE DOTAR AND PRESIDENT TRUMP

101
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:56,240
CALLING HIM SHORT AND FAT.

102
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,075
AND IT'S BASICALLY FLUID.

103
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:00,611
I'M PRETTY SURE WE'LL END UP

104
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:01,979
GETTING THERE AND THAT'S TO THE

105
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:03,180
BETTERMENT OF ALL AMERICANS.

106
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,049
THIS ISN'T ALONG PARTY LINES AT

107
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:06,283
ALL, THIS IS WHAT'S BEST FOR

108
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:07,585
AMERICA, SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN

109
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:08,319
MAKE PROGRESS HERE.

110
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,587
ELIZABETH: YOU KNOW, BRIE, I

111
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:11,055
WANT TO BRING IN ONE--

112
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:13,157
I WANT TO WEAVE CHINA INTO THE

113
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:13,958
CONVERSATION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,

114
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,659
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CRITICAL

115
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,262
OF PRESIDENT XI FOR A NUMBER OF

116
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:18,629
REASONS.

117
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:20,164
HOW BIG OF A ROLE SHOULD THEY

118
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:21,799
PLAY OR SHOULD THEY NOT PLAY A

119
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:22,967
ROLE AT ALL?

120
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,101
>> THEY ABSOLUTELY SHOULD PLAY A

121
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:24,702
BIG ROLE.

122
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:27,038
AT THE END OF THE DAY, CHINA IS

123
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,539
THE COUNTRY THAT'S PROPPING UP

124
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:29,340
KIM JONG-UN'S REGIME.

125
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,875
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED TO

126
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,810
BE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH

127
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,144
THEM.

128
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:34,678
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT CHINA IS

129
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:36,514
NOT IN A POSITION WHERE THEY

130
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:38,215
WANT TO GIVE UP THEIR SPHERE OF

131
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:39,283
INFLUENCE AND THEY'RE RAPIDLY

132
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:40,484
EXPANDING IT.

133
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:41,986
WE HEARD FROM GILLIAN A FEW

134
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:44,121
MOMENTS AGO THE WAY THAT THEY'RE

135
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:45,823
DEVELOPING WEAPONS IN THE

136
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:47,091
ISLANDS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA

137
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:48,859
AND POSITION THEMSELVES, YOU

138
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:50,261
KNOW, AS A GLOBAL SUPER POWER,

139
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:51,595
WHICH THEY ARE AND TRYING TO

140
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:54,165
KIND OF HAVE THIS CONFLICT WITH

141
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:55,666
US AND TRY TO SAY WE'RE BIGGER

142
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,003
THAN YOU, WE'RE EXPANDING, DOING

143
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:00,037
THESE THINGS AND ALL THAT HAVE

144
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:01,972
IS A RAPID CHANGE IN FOREIGN

145
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:04,175
POLICY DIRECTION IN THE PAST

146
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:04,909
DECADE WE'RE SEEING.

147
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:06,110
I THINK WE NEED TO RESPOND TO IT

148
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,045
AND SAY, THIS NEEDS TO STOP AND

149
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:09,780
WE NEED TO HAVE A REALISTIC

150
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,514
CONVERSATION ABOUT EVERYTHING

151
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:12,583
THAT'S GOING ON THERE, SO,

152
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,052
DEFINITELY, 100% IMPORTANT TO

153
00:04:15,052 --> 00:04:16,420
INVOLVE CHINA AND GET THEM AT

154
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,353
THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AS WELL.

155
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:18,822
ELIZABETH: ROBIN, I WANT TO GIVE

156
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:20,224
YOU THE LAST WORD BECAUSE THE

157
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:21,992
PRESIDENT EVEN TWEETED THAT THE

158
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:23,828
BORDER HAS BECOME MORE POROUS.

159
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:25,362
OBVIOUSLY, HE'S REFERRING TO THE

160
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:27,465
SANCTIONS BEING LIFTED FOR NORTH

161
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:29,266
KOREA, COMING FROM CHINA,

162
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:30,601
MEANING THAT THEY REALLY HAVEN'T

163
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,503
BEEN FOLLOWING THROUGH AND BEING

164
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:35,039
AS HARD ON NORTH KOREA AS THEY

165
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:35,406
SHOULD.

166
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:36,607
I WANT TO I HAVE GO YOU THE LAST

167
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:37,942
WORD ON CHINA'S INVOLVEMENT AND

168
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:39,210
POSSIBILITY OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT

169
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,877
GOING FORWARD.

170
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:41,679
>> IT'S SORT OF TROUBLESOME.

171
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:44,815
YOU KNOW WHAT BOTHERS ME THE

172
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:51,755
MOST ARE THE SECRETIVE MEETINGS.

173
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:53,624
AND SEEMS LIKE CHINA IS TRYING

174
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:56,360
TO DO A POWER PLAY.

175
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,995
I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WANT THE

176
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:00,531
POWER, BUT KIM JONG-UN IS A

177
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:01,132
NOTORIOUS LIAR.

178
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:02,533
CONDOLEEZZA RICE KNOWS VERY WELL

179
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,934
THIS, SO IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

180
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:05,836
TO SEE HOW THIS IS GOING TO TURN

181
00:05:05,836 --> 00:00:00,000
OUT.
