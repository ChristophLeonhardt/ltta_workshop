but that audiotape that NBC just started playing the prey Pro Publica released in the last hour so it is heart-wrenching it's children wailing in this Detention Center in these cages and that is going to move a lot of people let's listen to that audio and again this is initially released by Pro Publica we got it from the immigration lawyer the ACLU lawyer but NBC News has not been able to verify it still listen to this audio these are children crying for their parents at a detention center children who have been separated from their parents don't know where their parents are scared kids if you ever heard a kid cry like that you'd know where that comes from that's fear what is going on at the Republican Party last last time the Republican Party was empowered this was something that they wouldn't do why now is it okay because they're afraid of Donald Trump they're afraid of one tweet from Donald Trump and it really hurting them getting reelected it's that simple we're still in primary season for a couple more months so it's going to be difficult for those Republicans to come out who are up for reelection in the house but this is going to continue to be a problem with for 20,000 children like you said by August the the stories are always are going to grow and what's worse is I think that we're probably going to have some kind of real tragedy while these kids are being traumatized if there's any type of tragedy which just the odds unfortunately are I think that this that will lead to a radical change in policy if that's about it is the administration banking on Donald Trump's base being okay with this the administration is banking on the fact that they can talk to a certain amount a group of people who are always going to be anti immigrants no matter what you say that's all they're talking to and that's what they're hoping to keep it up and yes they're muddling in the waters I would also say this Donald Trump brand on this right and so people voted for him knowing that there would be deportation forces if you go back and look at the videotape of the third debate Hillary Clinton was wearing a right white that's how you know it was the third debate red white and blue and she says in that debate there will be deportation forces and she did not want to be in in the business of ripping children away from their mothers she literally says that verbatim he's shaking his head as if she is making it all up but now we're seeing exactly what we warned everyone about and we were sort of shaking everyone like wake up wake up we're gonna be separating babies from their parents is that something you support don't vote for Donald Trump if you don't want to see that I wasn't just the third debate the man announced he was running for president by saying right next to go was sending rapists and criminals the porter he basically said as much a moment ago saying that there are very bad people coming and holding kids even though there are msn ms-13 gang members he he talked about building a wall and capping all the others out he wanted to institute a Muslim ban right it's played right with a lot of the Republican Party it did and you're playing with Republican Party and we know the president is singularly focused on his base he feels like they're the ones who got in here he is delivered virtually every policy this White House creates is delivered for that base and this is a moment where especially over the weekend where it seemed like there might have been some bipartisan pressure to end this we saw Laura Bush speak out in her comments echoed by Michelle Obama today we had Mitt Romney's speak out there are some Republicans who have said this should stop this is not what we stand for but all this administration has done today is double down in order Neilsen sessions Trump and unless there's been some remarkable sea change in the last few hours I think we'll see Nielson again any minute step to that podium and do the same it would be extremely contentious briefing that audio we were just listening to they just played it some reporters had it played and allowed in that briefing room a few minutes ago those reporters have all heard this audio one has to assume those questions are gonna be asked of Sarah Sanders and secretary Nielsen I would I would like them to ask though they're characterizing all of these people as criminals are those babies that are crying are they also criminals because that's what they're doing they're criminal you care you're punishing the children for the actions of the parents and that is wrong I don't think that that is moral and something that we should stand behind hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do
