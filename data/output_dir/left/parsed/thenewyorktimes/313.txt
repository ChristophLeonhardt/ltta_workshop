The Roman Catholic Church has been banned
in China for more than 60 years.
Now, the Vatican is trying
to change that.
Here’s a look at
why an agreement
between the Chinese
government and the Vatican
would be controversial.
China severed ties
with the Vatican in 1951.
That was shortly after the
Communist Party took power.
China then formed the Chinese
Catholic Patriotic Association,
which isn’t recognized
by the Vatican
so it has to choose its own
bishops.
Catholics loyal to Rome 
started an “underground” church.
This has left more than 10
million Chinese Catholics
with two options.
Worship in unofficial
“house churches,”
or pray in state-sanctioned churches
run by non-ordained
clergy members.
The underground community has
faced ongoing persecution.
Vatican-appointed bishops
have been thrown in jail,
and their churches
have been demolished.
Other popes, including John Paul II 
and Benedict XVI,
tried but failed
to open a dialogue
with the Chinese government.
Now, Pope Francis is
considering giving Beijing
a say in the ordination
of bishops in China.
The negotiations are
angering Catholics
who feel the pope is
conceding too much
to the communist government.
Cardinal Joseph Zen has
been vocal in his dissent.
The government is free
to make any choice they like.
They are not going to make a 
good choice for the church.
They understand only politics.
