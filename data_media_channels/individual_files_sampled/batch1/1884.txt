the Saudi stock market suffered its biggest fall in years following president Trump's warning it recovered slightly during the day but it was the first tangible sign of the impact of this crisis and the Saudi economy an impact too on the once cozy relationship between the Trump administration and Saudi leaders a statement released by the Saudi news agency threatening global retaliation against any sanction came just hours after President Trump spoke of severe punishment should Saudi Arabia prove complicit in Jamal Ashoka's disappearance no doubt among members of Congress that this should involve economic sanction despite president Trump's stated reluctance for such measures so I will just say this to you with full confidence if this is proven to be true there is going to be a response from Congress it's going to be nearly unanimous it's going to be swift and it's gonna go pretty far and that could include arm sales but it could include a bunch of other things as well European leaders - making clear they will not stand by they must have seen the huge international concern from the United States now from Britain France and Germany and what they need to do is to cooperate fully with the investigation that the Turks are asking us to do and to get the bottom of this and if as they say this this terrible murder didn't happen then where is Jamal khashoggi and that's what the world wants to know a former CIA director casting doubt on the vehement Saudi denials of involvement their denials ring hollow very much ring hollow to go after a permanent resident knighted States who writes for The Washington Post and doing it on foreign soil at a diplomatic mission to me it would be inconceivable that such an operation would be run by the Saudis without the knowledge of the day-to-day decision maker of Saudi Arabia that's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in an apparent bid to defuse the tension the Saudi foreign ministry has released a tweet thanking the US and others for refraining from jumping to conclusions despite this though a relationship that was once so warm is along with the Saudi stock market reaching a new low Mike Hanna al Jazeera Washington
