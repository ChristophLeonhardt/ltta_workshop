GOP CANDIDATES ARE EXPECTED TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE. SOME WILL HAVE TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM DONALD TRUMP. PRESIDENT TRUMP WON'T BE WELCOMED IN EVERY STATE WITH A REPUBLICAN IS TRYING TO HOLD ON BECAUSE THE MID-TERMS WILL BE A REFERENDUM ON TRUMP. Martha: THE MEDIA PREDICTED TO WIN THE 2018 MID-TERMS CANDIDATE WOULD HAVE TO BE AT ARM'S LENGTH FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP. BUT A NEW ANALYSIS SAYS THE OPPOSITE MAY BE HAPPENING. 4 IN 10 GOP CANDIDATES PRAISED OR ECHOED THE PRESIDENT IN THEIR POLITICAL ADVERTISING. AND NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS CRITICIZING OR DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THE PRESIDENT. MY NEXT GUEST IS ONE OF THOSE WHO HAS TAKEN A CUE FROM THE TRUMP PLAYBOOK. WATCH. DONALD TRUMP IS RIGHT. WE MUST SECURE THE BORDER AND END SANCTUARY CITIES. IF YOU ARE GOING TO DATE ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS. RESPECT AND A HEALTHY APPRECIATION FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT. SIR. WE ARE GOING TO GET ALONG JUST FINE. I HAVE A BIG TRUCK. JUST IN CASE I NEED TO ROUNDUP CRIMINAL ILLEGALS AND TAKE THEM HOME MYSELF. YEP, I JUST SAID THAT. Martha: GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE BRIAN KEMP A REPUBLICAN YOU HAVE A DEBATE COMING UP TONIGHT. WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING TIME WITH US. YOU WERE CHUCKLING WHEN WE CAME BACK ON CAMERA. ANYTHING IN THESE ADS TONGUE IN CHEEK OR 100% WHERE YOU ARE? NO, IT'S TONGUE AND CHEEK, BUT IT'S ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE GREAT MESSAGE WE HAVE TRACKING AND DEPORTING CRIMINAL ILLEGALS AND MAKING GEORGIA NUMBER 1 FOR SMALL BUSINESSLIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING. CUTTING GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. I HAVE BEEN RUNNING THIS CAMPAIGN LIKE THIS FOR 14 MONTHS. IT'S WHO I AM. I SUPPORT THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND RUNNING A CAMPAIGN TO PUT GEORGIA FIRST. THEY WANT A GOVERNOR THAT WILL FIGHT FOR THEM. I WILL DO THAT AS THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA. Martha: CASEY IS LEADING IN THE POLLS RIGHT NOW. THE TH THE ADS SOUND SIMILAR. HOW ARE YOURS DIFFERENT? THIS IS ABOUT TRUST. WHOM DO YOU TRUST TO FIGHT FOR YOUR CONSERVATIVE VALUES? I HAVE A GREAT RECORD OF DOING THAT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR FOR OVER 30 YEARS NOW. ALSO AS A STATE SENATOR AND NOW AS SECRETARY OF STATE. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. I AM THE ONLY PERSON IN THE RACE THAT HAS EXECUTIVE BRANCH EXPERIENCE. I SUED THE OBAMA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TWICE AND DEFENDED OUR PHOTO IDLAW AND STOOD UP TO THE LEFT. THAT'S WHO I AM. YOU SEE THAT IN OUR TELEVISION ADS. Martha: I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF POT IN GEORGIA. WHETHER OR NOT YOU SEE THAT AS AN AREA WHERE REGULATION SHOULD BE DROPPED? IF YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD SOURCE OF STATE INCOME FOR TAXING? I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD SOURCE OF STATE INCOME IN GEORGIA. OUR ECONOMY IS GREAT. I WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER BY FOCUSSING ON SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE. THOSE FOLKS ARE STILL HURTING. THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE IF THEY CAN GET IS UNAFFORDABLE BECAUSE OF OBLERMAN. OBAMACARE. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR STATE AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE GROWING. HONESTLY THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA IS AN ISSUE IN OUR STATE AND THE STATE MADE SOME MOVEMENT ON THAT. AS FAR AS CULTIVATION AND OTHER THINGS, I DON'T THINK YOU WILL SEE THAT ANY TIME SOON IN OUR STATE. I UNDERSTAND THE FAMILIES AND WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH WITH THEIR KIDS. THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE CLINICAL RESEARCH. I STICK TO MY MESSAGE OF CONSERVATIVE VALUES AND CUTTING GOVERNMENT AND DEFENDING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. WE HAVE A PUBLIC SAFETY REFORM OF TRACKING AND DEPORTING CRIMINALS AND GOING AFTER STREET GANGS. AS A FATHER OF THREE DAUGHTERS I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR SAFETY. Martha: IN THE PRIMARIES IT'S EASY TO RUN FURTHER TO THE RIGHT. IF YOU MAKE IT RUNNING AGAINST THE DEMOCRAT IN GEORGIA, DO YOU WANT PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STAND BESIDE YOU ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL? I WOULD LOVE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO COME DOWN TO GEORGIA. PEOPLE APPRECIATE WHAT HE IS DOING AND FIGHTING THE LIBERAL MEDIA. I THINK THAT'S WHAT I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THE LAST TWO WEEKS. I AM RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN FOR BRIAN KEMP TO BE GOVERNOR AND NOT DONALD TRUMP. THOSE MESSAGES THAT I HAVE, THEY ARE MY VALUES. THAT'S WHAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA ABOUT. I THINK IT'S STARTING TO RESONATE BECAUSE OF OUR TELEVISION ADS. THE LAST 2 POLLS SHOWED THE LEADER GOING DOWN US GOING UP.
