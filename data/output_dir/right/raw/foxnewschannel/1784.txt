00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:03,185
I'M A GIRL.

4
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:04,053
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

5
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:05,221
WE WERE CHATTING ALL THREE

7
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:06,856
ALL RIGHT.

8
00:00:06,856 --> 00:00:08,891
A NEW CAMPAIGN AD IS URGING

9
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:11,060
MOTHERS TO TALK TO THE THEIR

10
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,461
CHILDREN ABOUT THE DANGERS

11
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:13,129

12
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:14,564

13
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:16,699
TALK WITH GIRLS.

14
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,601
BUT THINGS NEVER REALLY

15
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,337
WORKED OUT FOR SOME REASON.

16
00:00:21,337 --> 00:00:24,006
I WORRIED WHEN HE WENT TO

17
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:25,908
COLLEGE, BUT HE CAME HOME

18
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:26,208
OFTEN.

19
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,244
I GUESS HE NEVER REALLY

20
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:29,712
LEARNED TO DO HIS OWN

21
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:30,379
LAUNDRY.

22
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,448
IT WASN'T UNTIL I MET HIS

23
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:36,452
COLLEGE BUDDIES THAT I

24
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:37,553
REALIZED THAT IT MIGHT BE

25
00:00:37,553 --> 00:00:38,821
TOO LATE.

26
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,089
THIS MOTHER'S DAY, TALK TO

27
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:45,294

29
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:47,096
AINSLEY: DOES THAT AD GO TOO

30
00:00:47,096 --> 00:00:48,431
FAR OR DO YOU THINK IT'S ALL

31
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:49,265

YOU WERE LAUGHING.

39
00:00:57,573 --> 00:01:00,042
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.

40
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:00,476
WHY?

41
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:03,279
>> IT'S PARODY.

42
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:05,447
IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.

43
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:06,749
TOM STIERS IS A BILLIONAIRE.

44
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:08,084
IS HE SUPPORTING THIS

45
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:08,651
EFFORT.

46
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,019
HE COULD HAVE HIRED A BETTER

47
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:11,754
COMEDY WRITER.

48
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:12,221
AINSLEY: CATHY?

49
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:15,324
>> THIS IS ABOUT AS FUNNY AS

50
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:17,493
KATHY GRIFFIN HOLDING UP A

51
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:18,361
BLOODIED HEAD OF THE

52
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:18,728

SHE CALLED THAT IS A

54
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:20,062
SHE CALLED THAT SS A

55
00:01:20,062 --> 00:01:20,096
SHE CALLED THAT SATA

56
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:20,363
SHE CALLED THAT SATIRE.

57
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:21,797
I'M BLACK.

58
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:22,498
I'M A CONSERVATIVE.

59
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:23,733
I VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP

60
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:24,300

00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,768
I INTEND TO VOTE FOR HIM

62
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:26,636
AGAIN IN 2020.

63
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:29,271
DOES THAT MAKE ME A TORCH

64
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:30,773
CARRYING CARD MEMBER OF THE

65
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:31,040
KKK?

66
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,741
IT DOESN'T.

67
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:33,576
BUT, LIBERALS TEND NOT TO

68
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:34,877
GET IT.

69
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:36,545
THAT'S THE HEIGHT OF RACISM.

70
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:37,813
YOU THINK YOU CAN LOOK AT ME

71
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:39,382
AND TELL ME WHO I AM AND

72
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:41,250
IT'S THAT KIND OF ARROGANCE

73
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,184
THROUGHOUT THE AD.

74
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:42,885
THROUGHOUT THE DEMOCRATIC

75
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:44,487
PARTY THAT GOT DONALD TRUMP

76
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:47,256
ELECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

77
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:48,758
>> THAT ATTITUDE, LOOK, THAT

78
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:50,326
IS THE HEIGHT OF THIS

79
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:50,793
ADMINISTRATION.

80
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:55,264

00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,236
DONALD TRUMP ARE IN EFFECT

85
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:01,170
SUPPORTING THAT KIND OF

86
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:01,537
ACTIVITY.

87
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:07,276
>> NO, THAT IS NOT --

88
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:08,610
AINSLEY: THAT'S A BLANKET

89
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:08,978
STATEMENT.

90
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:10,579
>> THAT RACIST IS

91
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:10,979
INTOLERANT.

92
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,881
>> HOW CAN YOU.

93
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,551
>> DEMEANING AND AIR

94
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:16,519
>> DEMEANING AND ARROGANT.

95
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,287
THE IF ANYTHING THIS TSA

96
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:19,555
SERVES AS A GET OUT THE VOTE

97
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:20,723
FOR SEARCHES, RIGHT?

98
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,991
THESE ARE THE SAME ARROGANT

99
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:22,925
AND DEMEANING PEOPLE THAT

100
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:24,260
ARE BEHIND THIS AD.

101

OBAMA SPEECH WRITER.

109
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:38,908
HEY, TOM STEYER, THE ADS ARE

110
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,176
COUNTER PRODUCTIVE AND

111
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:40,543
ANNOYING.

112
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:41,644
YOU ARE NOT HELPING ANYONE

113
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:42,712
BUT YOURSELF, MAYBE.

114
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:43,979
AND YOU ARE WASTING MONEY

115
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:45,681
THAT COULD REALLY HELP THAT

116
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:47,016
WHEN WE ARE IN THE FIGHT FOR

117
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:48,050
OUR POLITICAL LIVES.

118
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,685
THAT'S A DEMOCRAT.

119
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:51,954

00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:57,460
THIS SO IRK SOME TO

121
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:57,893

ALONG THE LINES OF

127
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,610
CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGY THAT

128
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,178
THE MOTHER SHOULD BE IN THE

129
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:17,313

PHYSICAL EMBODIMENT OF THAT

146
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,039

HOME.

194
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,047
I TALK ABOUT POLITICS WITH

195
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:58,814
MY CHILDREN AT HOME.

196
00:04:58,814 --> 00:05:00,149
THE RADIO IS ON ALL THE

197
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:00,449
TIME.

198
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,283
THESE ARE ACTUAL ISSUES THAT

199
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:02,117
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT.

200
00:05:02,117 --> 00:05:02,952
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT

201
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:04,320
MOTHERS TO BE INFLUENCING

202
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,020
THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT WHAT

203
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,322
THE G.O.P. IS ABOUT, THEN

204
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:07,890
YOU NEED TO BE HAVING A

205
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,691
DIFFERENT MESSAGE ABOUT WHAT

206
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:09,458
THE G.O.P. IS.

207
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,627
>> MISLEADING AND DEROGATORY

208
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:12,027
INFORMATION.

209
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:13,028
THERE IS NO TRUTH THERE.

210
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,597
I AM NOT TRYING TO BEAT UP

211
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:15,631
ON POOR KIDS.

212
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:16,599
I AM NOT WALKING AROUND WITH

213
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:18,534
A TORCH IN MY HAND.

214
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:23,239
AND I AM NOT TRYING TO BEAT

215
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,974
UP ILLEGALLIES AND SEND THEM

216
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:25,274
HOME.

217
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:26,208
IT'S DEROGATORY.

218
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,143
TALK TO YOUR CHILDREN, TALK

219
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:30,112
ABOUT FACTS.

220
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:32,348
TALK ABOUT CLEAR-EYED LOGIC

221
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:33,716
AND STOP THE CONSTANT

222
00:05:33,716 --> 00:00:00,000
NARRATIVE OF PUSHING HATE.
