MAIN -- .2 OF THE PUSHBACK ON

13
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:34,564
THE POTENTIAL EVE OF A HISTORIC

14
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:34,898
SENATE?

15
00:00:34,898 --> 00:00:35,432
>> AND A SURPRISE.

16
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:38,769
I THINK IS A NEGOTIATING TACTIC

17
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:39,303
LIKE KIM JONG-UN.

18
00:00:39,303 --> 00:00:42,306
HE IS PLAYING TO THE HOME TEAM.

19
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:43,640
THIS IS DESIGNED FOR

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,109
CONSUMPTION BY THE NORTH KOREAN

21
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:46,877
PEOPLE AND AT THE SAME TIME HE

22
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:47,544
SAID THIS, THE NORTH KOREAN

23
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:49,046
GOVERNMENT ISSUED A STATEMENT

24
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:52,282
TO THE PEOPLE SAYING THAT THE

25
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:53,050
REASON THE SUMMIT IS TAKING

26
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:53,750
PLACE IS BECAUSE KIM JONG-UN

27
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,719
LOVES THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE.

28
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,954
I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON.

29
00:00:56,954 --> 00:00:59,156
AND DON'T FORGET, WHERE DO WE

30
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:01,558
HEAR THIS PHRASE, MAXIMUM

31
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:01,925
PRESSURE?

32
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:03,460
IT BEGAN WHEN THE NATIONAL

33
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,126
SECURITY ADVISOR FOR SOUTH

34
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:04,894
KOREA WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE

35
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:08,932
AND MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT

36
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:09,766
THE SUMMIT WAS GOING TO TAKE

37
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:10,067
PLACE.

38
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,034
HE THANKED PRESIDENT TRUMP ON

39
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:16,673

00:01:16,673 --> 00:01:17,374
GOVERNMENT, SAYING HIS POLICY

41
00:01:17,374 --> 00:01:18,508
OF MAXIMUM PRESSURE WAS WORKING

42
00:01:18,508 --> 00:01:20,410
FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY

43
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,144
FOR THE SANCTIONS WERE WORKING

44
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:21,912
AND HE SAID WE HAVE GOT TO STAY

45
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:22,212
TOUGH.

46
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:22,980
KEEP THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE GOING

47
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,848
ON AND UNTIL WE SEE THAT KIM

48
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:27,017
JONG-UN WOUND, HIS WORDS MATCH

49
00:01:27,017 --> 00:01:27,617
HIS ACTIONS.

50
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:30,554
WE DO NOT SEE KIM JONG-UN TODAY

51
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:32,956
ATTACKING THE SOUTH KOREAN

52
00:01:32,956 --> 00:01:33,790
GOVERNMENT FOR SAYING THAT.

53
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,225
BY JUST THINKING THIS IS A

54
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,059
NEGOTIATING TACTIC AND HE IS

55
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:37,160
PLAYING TO THE HOME TEAM.

56
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,063
>> FROM 1994 WE HAD AN

57
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:41,631
AGREEMENT UNDER THE

58
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:44,034
ADMINISTRATION THAT DID NOT

59
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:44,501
BASICALLY WORK.

60
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:47,304
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, TOOK

61
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:50,574
NORTH KOREA OFF OF THE

62
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:51,475
STATE-SPONSORED TERRORIST LIST

63
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:52,843
FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT HOPING

64
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:53,744
TO GIVE THE CARROTS BUT YOU

65
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:54,978
KNOW WE JUST GOT KICKED IN THE

66
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:56,880
REAR END OVERTIME.

67
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,581
WHAT HAS CHANGED NOW?

68
00:01:57,581 --> 00:01:59,583
YOU THINK THAT IT DIRECTLY IS

69
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,884
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

70
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:01,918
STATES AND HIS RHETORIC?

71
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:03,720
WHEN HE HAS SAID ABOUT "ROCKET

72
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,621
MAN" AND THEIR NEED TO DESTROY

73
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,656
NORTH KOREA?

74
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:08,491
THAT SOME SAW AS BEING

75
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:08,892
RESPONSIBLE?

76
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:12,095
>> I THINK HE DID GET IN THE

77
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:12,829
HEAD OF KIM JONG-UN.

78
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:13,697
I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME WE

79
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:15,699
HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS

80
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,300
ACTUALLY DEALT WITH THE NORTH

81
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,734
KOREAN THREAT.

82
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:20,804
THE PROBLEM IS, IN THE PAST WE

83
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:21,671
HAVE HAD PRESIDENTS I BELIEVE

84
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:23,507
IN BOTH PARTIES WHO KICK THE

85
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:24,274
CAN DOWN THE ROAD.

86
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:25,275
THIS PRESIDENT HAS CONFLICT OF

87
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,577
THE SITUATION AND HE HAS GOT

88
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:28,311
SOME SANCTIONS THAT HAVE

89
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:28,645
WORKED.

90
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:29,346
I WILL TELL YOU, I THINK THE

91
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:33,183
ONE THAT HAS PROBABLY HAD THE

92
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:37,320
GREATEST IMPACT GETTING US TO

93
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,321
THIS POINT, ONE SANCTIONING THE

94
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:40,090
CHINESE COMPLIED WITH, THAT WAS

95
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:40,690
SHUTTING OFF THE MONEY

96
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,358
LAUNDERING THAT WAS TAKING

97
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:41,992
PLACE WITH THE IRANIANS

98
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:44,094
LAUNDERING MONEY THROUGH

99
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:44,828
CHINESE BANKS TO HELP PAY FOR

100
00:02:44,828 --> 00:02:48,498
THE NORTH KOREAN BALLISTIC AND

101
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:51,334
NUCLEAR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.

102
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:55,005
THAT CASH SUPPLY HAS STARTED TO

103
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:55,739
DRY UP.

104
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:56,473
I BELIEVE IRAN AND THE EVIDENCE

105
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:57,074
IS THERE THAT THEY'VE

106
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:57,908
OUTSOURCED OVER THE YEARS SO

107
00:02:57,908 --> 00:02:59,876
MUCH OF THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM TO

108
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:01,244
NORTH KOREA.

109
00:03:01,244 --> 00:03:03,413
AND SO, THIS IS ONE OF THE

110
00:03:03,413 --> 00:03:04,147
SANCTIONS THAT EVEN OUR

111
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:08,752
TREASURY DEPARTMENT HAS SAID

112
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:09,453
THAT CHINA IS COMPLIANT WITH.

113
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:10,620
>> OTHER CITY IN THE SANCTIONS

114
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,321
AGAINST OFFICE 39 SUPPOSEDLY

115
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:15,892
THE SECRET UNIT THAT PROVIDES A

116
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:16,626
HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS AND

117
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:19,863
MERCEDES-BENZ IS IN EVERYTHING.

118
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:21,131
THAT IS DEFINITELY TAKING

119
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:21,832
IMPACTED ALSO SOMETHING ELSE

120
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:22,165
HAPPEN.

121
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:27,571
THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF SOUTH

122
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:28,338
CAROLINA, THEY HAD DEALS IN THE

123
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:31,241
PAST BUT WHY IS THE POTENTIAL

124
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:36,680
VISIT UPCOMING TO NORTH KOREA

125
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,180
SOME SIGNIFICANT?

126
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,714
>> WAS A BIG DEAL.

127
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:39,015
THIS HAD BEEN PLANNED FOR SOME

128
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:39,316
TIME.

129
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:43,920
AS YOU POINT OUT, WHAT'S

130
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,721
INTERESTING IS THAT SENIOR

131
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:47,023
LEADERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND

132
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:50,527
SENIOR LEADERS NORTH KOREA LAST

133
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:51,361
WEEK BASICALLY GAVE THE THUMBS

134
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:52,662
UP AND ALLOWED FOR THIS VISIT

135
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:53,096
TO GO FORWARD.

136
00:03:53,096 --> 00:04:00,837
DAVID BEASLEY IS NOT A UN

137
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:02,072
DEMOCRAT.

138
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:02,873
HE HAS BROUGHT REFORMS OF

139
00:04:02,873 --> 00:04:04,307
MONTHLY PROGRAM, HE IS ACTUALLY

140
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:05,008
CALLED OUT EUROPEANS SAYING

141
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:08,078
THAT WE HAVE GOT TO GET TOUGH

142
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:09,012
WITH RADICAL ISLAM ESCROW USING

143
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:09,646
THIS AS A RECRUITING TOOL.

144
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:14,751
AND HERE IS WHAT, WHY I THINK

145
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:15,552
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE

146
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:16,486
PRESENT STRENGTH TO PULL OFF A

147
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:17,087
DEAL OF ALL DEALS.

148
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:20,824
HE NEEDS AT GROUND TRUTH.

149
00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:22,659
HE NEEDS TO KNOW ALL OF THE

150
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:22,959
CARDS.

151
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,094
NOT ONLY WILL THE GOVERNOR BE

152
00:04:24,094 --> 00:04:25,262
THERE YOU HAVE EXPERTS FROM THE

153
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:28,231
WORLD FOOD PROGRAM.

154
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:29,099
CERTAINLY THEY WILL SPEND HALF

155
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:30,333
IF NOT MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR

156
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:35,172
TIME IN THE FIELD TO SEE IS IT

157
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:42,879
REALLY WORKING GETTIS THE

158
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,515
PEOPLE STATE THIS SUMMER FOR

159
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:46,249

REALLY GOING ON.

166
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,360

167
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,163
HORRIBLE SITUATION THERE.
