hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered i'm peter Lavelle Washington's ambassador to NATO threatens to take out Russian missiles and the US Interior Secretary threatens a naval blockade of Russia is the Trump doctrine finally being revealed crosstalking some real news i'm joined by my guests here in moscow mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Dimitri Babak she's a political analyst with Sputnik International and we have Glenn Dee's and he is a professor at the higher School of Economics all right generally crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in anytime you want I always appreciate Glenn let me go to you first here we have this Kay Bailey Hutchinson the American ambassador to NATO she had a little while she got into a bit of a scrap threatening to take out Russian missiles what's the backstory what's it mean well the reason why she wanted to take out the Russian missile Cisco's well they're arguing Russia's developing a new missiles which goes counter to the NF Treaty which is for our viewers for a medium-range missiles so but which well I guess in her defense after what she did try to walk it back but but in the process she actually made it a lot worse because her argument essentially was that no it's not a first strike we merely want to take out the Russian missiles we're not gonna we're not gonna attack Russian cities and this is quite astonishing and and again this this defense was also put forward in Washington Post which is quite extraordinary because the whole purpose of a first strike of course is to use precision weapons and tactical nuclear weapons to take out adversaries weapons yes so they can't retaliate is the second strike capabilities that have the intention of actually attacking big cities to make big damage as possible and because that's the deterrence to the other side won't to a first strike now you're saying she doesn't really know what she's talking about all this to possible explanation once this the first movie is mind boggling incompetency the second would be it's deliberate possibly propaganda in terms of essentially advancing a first-strike policy but again essentially under a very ambiguous ambiguous just receiving but it's not it's it's much more than just a statement here it shows an intentionality mark yeah I mean the attempt to walk this statement back is is obviously second is it comes after the fact it's post facto because during the conference said the need to take out these missiles and then she answered a second question from a journalist who said we're a little excited well we're a little excited here could you specify whether you want these missiles withdrawn or whether you mean something a little more military and literal and she said well we would prefer to have them withdrawn but we have to talk about countermeasures if they are not withdrawn and and she would double down and she said take them out again did I mean let me quote her here's my point Russia needs to return to INF treaty compliance or we will need to match its capabilities to protect the US and NATO interests the current situation with Russia and blatant violation is untenable Dima well it reminds me of a phrase by a modern old bride before the war in Yugoslavia she said I'm not talking about war here I'm talking about the use of force and then shared it that's a very important distinction well I think this is very dangerous when you have ways to the fiction an attack like Japan attacked the United States without declaring a war in in December 1941 that's what it is you know you use force without officially declaring war that's much worse than than declare a war and attack another country so this is just very responsible and that was the reaction from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the United States simply the US official certainly don't understand how serious their remarks are with what serious matters they're playing you know okay well let's let's keep going with serious girl remarks here let's go to Ryan's eeking is the the interior secretary in charge of national parks okay he's got a lot more in his plate here apparently the United States has the ability with our Navy to make sure the sea lanes are open and if necessary to blockade to make sure that there any energy Russia's energy does not go to market Glenn a blockade is an act of war under international law yeah so this is twice in one week in knighted States of threatened Russia with war which is quite extraordinary but it also shows that well this is how all great powers often behave able to exert force because the United States ever since World War two has been able to control most of the most strategic maritime corridors so from Nadine in here and my canal to the Malacca Strait or the Persian Gulf so obviously during peacetime this is a way of you know having commercial benefit or moving troops easily or you know a good way of getting allies but during times of crisis or decline this is when you essentially cut off other series from trade routes and try to starve their economies to death and that's why we refer to them as choke points and it's quite an extraordinary they would threaten this against Russia as well and I think it's also related in my introduction I said yes the Trump doctrine being really revealed because we have in one week we have the threatening military force against a nuclear power Russia they both countries are in the negotiations over these weapons here they both sides accuse the other of violations and then we have basically this is just an extension of Trump's trade war but if you combined it this kind of comes together with a great powers vision of the world mark you in the Navy so to point out that even the threat of an attack of an aggression against Russia is technically an act of aggression and a violation of international by the nations charter now as a former US Navy man I have to say that I I think what the very knowledgeable about such matters Secretary of the Interior here and I'm being a little facetious has revealed a dangerous new capability of the u.s. Navy they have evidently equipped their ships with a transforming landshark attack so that US Navy ships can now go off the sea into the land to blockade Russia's energy supplies which the vast majority of our pipelines are right ship energy the vast majority mel ng it does some oil by tanker but the vast majority of Russia's energy to market Europe or China via pipelines so that is the only way I can interpret his remark but the interesting thing is that this is and it's it's not just Russia we're looking at China and of course we have the Iran sanctions looming here which we hopefully will be able to talk about here I mean this is the u.s. determining how countries trade who they can trade with and essentially what kind of relationships they have with other countries bypassing the United Nations and this is very important not only China and Russia getting sick of it you know during president Putin's visit to India this week the Indians let it be understood very clearly that if sanctions were not improved were not approved by the Security Council of the treaty which which which they are not we are not going to apply them I'm not going to you know they mean nothing to us and that was the message from India which has been basically kind of an ally of the United States during the closer yes during the last three or four years so people are getting really sick over of Trump doctrine if we call we can call it that you know Trump during his presence in the United Nations building he said first I want to talk to the Venezuelan president as if forgetting that just a few days ago he basically threatened intervention right so this is this is really I'm glad you brought that me I want to talk to the Venezuelan ambassador well I said we'll come to me they will come to me to make a deal while the same time they're trying they're doing everything they can on their power to overthrow that existing regime sorry sorry Bolton said openly during his meeting with the Iranian a position that we want to undermine the the Iranian government we don't want it to leave to the 40th anniversary of mujahideen II count on mr. Zink who is in charge of national parks made this remark about Russian energy about the blockade talking about Franken in the United States defending that strategy which is an environmentally very questionable right I think that points out how confusing you guess how domestic politics is influencing their foreign policy but yeah what point out that this effort to go after so many countries at the same time it undermines the strategy because again the main strategy or the main country to isolate for America would ideally be China I would assume given that they're the main we have other things only this week the European Union announced that they would establish common mechanisms with in cooperation with China and Russia to try to bypass both the US dollar and the transaction system yeah so and of course the Indians might want to through in their currency as well there because obviously they start to feel a bit uneasy as well so I think that that is a problem by trying to isolate everyone at the same time it could be isolating themselves and giving up what keep privilege which is exactly if you look at American hegemony in the world it's not just the military it's the financial system and people are starting to move away from it then they're developing the value of the dollar yeah first I'd like to say that Dimitri I think that you are understating because the US when you're talking about fracking because the US mainstream media has clearly reported in the last few weeks that the only reason there's any opposition to the pollution and you know and protests against fracking in the United States is because of Russian trolls it's all inspired I mean the people in Pennsylvania and across the US who have down Birdie brown dirty water that you can literally set on fire and earthquakes big hydraulic fracturing yes like a short person anymore you are vertically challenged it was always about anyway 40 seconds one yeah I think the belligerent rhetoric one we're talking Ryan's inky kay Bailey Hutchinson Nick Haylee Trump promising fire and fury we're looking at a truly ignorant and incompetent administration blundering blustering belligerently its way through a foreign policy into destroying the reputation of the United States so go team well the thing is is that the US wants to isolate certain countries but ultimately it's isolating itself yeah all right I'm gonna jump in here we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on some real news stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle to remind you were discussing some real news and I want to discuss something mark sent me just before that before we sat down here from the Washington Monthly an article this is quite fascinating prospects not supposed to be a comedy program but maybe we'll have some comedy here how the Republicans in Russia are remaking the Supreme Court now mark sent this to me because well it's kind of an what did you call it on Russia gate peak is that what you called it I think it's a really and it's written by a gentleman named John store store okay just some snippets here while it is still unclear whether Trump colluded and then we have parentheses with them the mother probe when completed will tell us more it is likely the Russian sub Russian saboteurs turned the election in favor in his favor Trump's James clapper the former Intel chief said as much go further from the Kremlin's point of view the best way to weaken our country is to increase the power of our most undemocratic branch you sent to me mark your reaction yeah well III think this reveals the the the true intent of the Russian operation to put the Manchurian Candidate Trump into office and this was to take over the Supreme Court of the United States Brett Kavanaugh you know so I don't I don't really know how to take this this is pure insanity it is a product of a fevered and delusional mind who wants to imagine anyone who disagrees with him politically like say the Supreme Court justice in the United States if that was just appointed whom I'm no fan of myself for political rather than say beer reasons but this this is we are seeing such a sanity not only does he actually question the legitimacy of Brett Kavanaugh many others is he references the work and he says he the work he references in the article claim that all five conservative members of report are illegitimate all right this is just Wow and it's Russia though he obviously embraced drinking beer so the author embrace Peter riding this okay I can go with that there is another curious quote from there he's quoted someone named Kathleen Hall Jamieson who is a legend in the political circles of Washington a Russians persuaded enough people in the right States to vote a certain way and on the same day we have this revelation from the US Court that they indicted seven more Russian intelligence officers so we've had thirteen indicted a few months ago now we have seven more twenty people persuaded three hundred million Americans in the right States to vote in a certain way or she writes persuaded people not to vote at all so if ten if 12 sorry 20 people could do that to millions then they're geniuses you know and and who is who are going to protect us to protect us from all of that Jeff Sessions you know that person of great integrity has been recused his reaction to these news about Russian hackers indicted state-sponsored hacking and disinformation campaigns campaigns pose serious threats to our security and to our open society but the Department of Justice is defending against them end of quote from Jeff said he was still around anyway and they forgot that James clapper who who thought of this article John Stuart quo quotes as an ultimate authority of Russians on Russians he said the trash inside genetically inclined to penetrate and interfere nikki Haley says nor less I think the reason why this is becoming a bit of a common is because this the Russia Gate thing it works I mean let's not let's not forget how this all started with Hillary Clinton was of course revealed that you know they were passing over question sir in town hall meetings and essentially they colluded so and since then Russia can really be blamed for everything so of course is some serious cases but now it's going to walk into the comedy section because if you if remember well my favorite I think was last week was blaming the poor Star Wars movie on the Kremlin because you know the Russian BOTS were out there it's all Western culture and but probably my favorite was George Takei the star trek' actor like he was accused of sexual harassment and essentially he turned around saying well that a lot of this online traffic is obviously Russian bots and and because he's you know been quite outspoken about LGTB rights Putin took a personal offense to it so Putin's coming after him so he sent out this tweet to try to assure it run dear friends and let me just reassure you that I will stand up against even though the Russians are coming for me I will continue to fight for you so so he went from being a sexual in a predator to essentially being a victim and fighter for justice so model in the UK that apparently was slipped to rat poison you know and she made the cover of some tabloid to be fair the mainstream media obviously nailed this one on the head because they're obviously honored monitoring my Twitter account because I indeed posted a negative review of the last Jedi I thought it was complete garbage is that the one we saw together no that was so low and I really like the critics hated it so again my attack I like to make people believe that solo was a good movie was obviously a Kremlin bought influence operation me being one of the most well known Kremlin influenced BOTS I guess is there anything that you don't like in the u.s. that you can now deny the agency of everyone and everyone else and claim that boris and Natasha are responsible for you know all the claims of meddling in American politics at the same time the United States openly talks about meddling in the politics of countries all over the world Iran is the best example Rudy Giuliani during the General Assembly walked across the street and we were saying you know regime change in 2019 I mean it's it really there's no introspection there's no self-reflection that's that's bipartisan because Nancy Pelosi is talking to me Kay as well and everyone gets behind you no talk of overthrowing the government in Venezuela Iran you know the u.s. meddling is is ubiquitous and at the same time European leaders during the election several European leaders not only use their state media that was extremely biased against Trump but several EU leaders openly publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton how many minds did they meddle and influence with how many minds did the Italian Prime Minister convince with with his endorsement of Hillary Clinton how there is no evidence of their core claims after two years deema but you know okay let's suppose I'm a person who believes the mainstream press then I should believe that two Russian agents poisoned the screep house on the 4th of March and then somehow the bottle with the poisonous substitute you know the substance lived until that 27th of June was used by two homeless persons in another town Amesbury then I am supposed to believe that's a statement from the British Foreign Office that Britain for the first time identified four cyber attacks as Russian sauce they include attacks against the Kiev metro Edessa Airport Russia Central Bank and now institutions in the UK the Russian central bank that u.s. they using Russian intelligence overtaking not only the British and Dutch and American objects you know including some nuclear fuel reprocessing extreme are they saying that the Russian central bank is an object of US influence in Russia there is high magazine at the end of the years could be the Russian bot you know that's the figure of in my logic is that the Western media declared and we're in a buildin of the chairman of the Russian central bank the best central banker in the world there was a very feisty conquer artic triage on line and then the Russian tank has decided I think that will immediately after the Cold War there was it was an interesting piece in New York Times I think was in 1993 was one of the leaders of National Endowment for democracy one of the sponsors of democracy days and he essentially made the argument that a lot of what they did during the Cold War covertly could now be done overtly in the name of democracy so didn't they didn't have to hide himself anymore so sense if you see a government which isn't not defined by u.s. Democratic then you can do whatever you want to topple it it's government funded okay and it's my idea what they will get it they were they were fearful they were fearful they were gonna lose their funding and then Trump flipped on it then they gotta make a good argument for promoting democracy but I think at the heart of it the problem is that it undermines the entire concept of international law because in international law there has to be reciprocity I mean if I give up my flexibility you know this he will expect the same from you so the problem here is of course that the West's you know the stewards of democracy can then say that no this is only us because we're the democracy so we can go in topple governments that allegedly Russia through WikiLeaks exposing that the Democratic primary was rigged by Hillary Clinton the DNC that that is a legitimate act of democratization it's not Kenneth walls okay Godfather of neo-realism political theory he made the argument that he was concerned about the west after the Cold War because he said they're not they don't we don't consider ourselves good because what we do but we can save ourselves good because who we are and essentially so we can accept yes we can say we can topple a democratically elected president in Ukraine and as a way to promote democracy and it will still be we sense the Cold War when and where has it worked still waiting Dima well I think there is an important exception and Glenn mentioned it it's Saudi Arabia we've had the hilarious yes but we had a hilarious statement from mr. Trump this week I love the king Kim sound not seeing Salman but I said King we're protecting you you might not be there for two weeks without us you have to pay for your military end of quote that is mr. Trump talking to that champion of democracy and the Crown Prince Edward Prince said I think it was very revealing what he said we buy everything with money I think that's a huge answer because they not only buy with oil they also buy good image because despite Prince Ben Salman's actions the Western press is not critical of him we will remember how thermos freedom was exhausted worn out by a lord componentry interview and embarrassment you know is that a very embarrassing moment we end on this your many thanks to my guest here in Moscow this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube page see you next time and remember across hoc rules now for the extended version of our program we have political potpourri Glenn let's go back to you you want to you're the arms control guy here on the program you said you wanted to revisit something about the first strike is a story that we had with this kay Bailey Hutchinson go ahead well we were discussing how well what you might mean the alternatively with taking out Russian missiles and yes we discuss they could like obviously been taking him out as a first strike but it could also develop into an alternative narrative doing if they're referring to the technology of shooting down the Russian missiles after they'd been launched now that would be interesting because the missile defense debate has well evolved you know more like it's a predictable direction because the missile defense is a it's very what we refer to as a salami tactics essentially they take one step at a time and if you remember back in 2007 Condoleezza Rice was trying to mock Russia because they were afraid of 10 interceptors being put in Poland however shortly after they were talking about 500 interceptors and now we're talking about interceptors in the thousands however Russia can be relaxed because these are you know it aimed against non-existent but this could maybe shift the intentions a bit now because the capabilities are there now and now they kind of might be able to shift the intention more towards Russia if they say well Russia's breaching the INF treaty they might aim this against us now essentially we need to develop even in her one possible walk back from her take out the missile scenario she still safe self owned their self goal on the US and pointed out that the anti-ballistic missile defense there is actually intended for Russia it seems to me since the end of the Cold War there's a growing assumption or wishing it to be true of moving towards a first-strike capability I mean and and and this is I think that's baked in right now I mean it's not they won't really admit it but I think that's why she got caught out by that because that's what her thinking is and that is what the satiric thinks remix I have written about you know first strike scenarios and they I've seen the articles you know in the academia and media both insisting that the u.s. is moving very close to a position where they could make a nuclear first strike on Russia and suffer acceptable losses back to this cult it is insane cold war rhetoric so you know I I don't I don't know where that leaves us when we really hope it's not tested demon well during one of the recent cross talks you said though you know talking with Professor Roberts and professor Petro that one of the problems of today's security is that there is that lack of respect I think that there's a clear lack of respect on the western side towards Russia because if such a statement like we are going to take out your missiles had been made in the seventies this person could have been fired and now this kay Bailey Hutchinson continues working Michael Flynn was fired and and his life was destroyed because he talked to the Russian ambassador and did not report something about it to the vice president I don't think even he he misinformed him in any way and now this woman is going to stay and with her views she's going to continue to be the ambassador of the United States it is the toast of neo-cons I'm sure okay what this goes back to Putin's 2007 Munich huge as so much does and and Putin decried the drive for us primacy of hegemony and he said you you cannot have absolute security for yourself without having an absolute lack of security for every other independent country on earth and that is simply unacceptable and it is creating a scenario we are forced back into an arms race and Cold War tensions by your you know impossible attempt to have absolute military primacy interesting thing is that you know she made these statements then she had an awkward walk while walking them back but you know it seems to me Glenn that we should because it should be a completely different conversation going on about new arms control agreements not taking out your missiles that when are we gonna start working on because some of these are these deadlines are there they're coming Romi the Trump admin has already indicated that it really has no intention of pursuing an renewals new start agreement in 2021 but this is again confusion about what the first strike is because again if if the Americans in a hypothetical first strike against Russia it's not about you know burning out the whole country but rather if you take out let's say 90 to 95% of Russia secondary capabilities secondary strike you build this then that is that the miss of Defense components should be able to absorb whatever remains left of Russia's weaponry however the implicit threat then is if you actually try to use your secondaries strike capabilities then we will go after all your cities so and essentially that's kind of what they communicated to the North Koreans as well like we might come and take your missiles if you if you try to retaliate then we'll go then we'll take out your cities as well so that's essentially what the function of the first rack capabilities and now obvious threats combine those missile defenses it's essentially for Russia to stand down and surrender and so it is ain't gonna happen daemon well besides the u.s. in Germany we have the EU hegemony which reveals itself revealed itself in a comic way this week there was this referendum in Macedonia which all the leaders of the youth trumpeted as a huge success ante but it wasn't until which we lived at 7:00 that actually less than 30% of the people vote it was on the new name for for this two million nation of Macedonia but and to play a critical new valuable role in NATO the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia now because it won't change its name because not enough people showed up for the vote despite being visited by Stoltenberg their general sector of Native America don't worry master course by mogherini I'm not naming all the titles because it really didn't make it so I mean what why is it interesting the EU has lost every referendum that they organised in the last 15 years they lost the brexit referendum they brought lost okay the the British government organised that but of course it was a referendum on the EU right they lost the vote on the European Constitution in France and and and Netherlands but they continued saying that they're the most democratic the best government part of the world and they they organized on Sunday a referendum in whom Romania in Romania you know people are voting on their attitude to the same-sex marriage and what is the main headline in the mainstream press the Romanian vote places sex same-sex marriage in jeopardy well the same-sex marriage has not yet been legislated but they are proceeding from the idea that they already won that all the European countries look like the European Union wants them to look like and any attempt to change it is a crime inspired by the Russian troll but I think it's hilarious that I looked at the commentary after the vote and it was if it was all written in advance kept saying your success it wasn't completely that the strategy by the opposition was to block the vote so it's essentially not vote because if it's below 50% and it wouldn't be valid valid yes but that's why this was so or villian because I read the Germans in the regions they British like all the newspapers and it was victory like all of them it didn't mean anything that it didn't go through it was victory and now and then of course all the Western leaders came up and essentially made a statement we now expect this to be pushed through and followed up and so so it's no literally this postmodernist recreating our own truth about Ukraine because they know because the result wasn't acceptable so they invalidated the vote well let's move on nothing to see here that's what I say they you works like a computer machine if they don't get the result that they want it's a votre travail better we try we try until you get the desired result for us there is a reason why the words the EU and democracy deficit are so common in academic studies of the European Union I would admit it yeah I want to switch gears here the u.s. announced a new counterterrorism strategy and and John Bolton of course was the one trumpeting it this is the first new robust and fully articulated strategy since 2011 under the Obama administration and they announced six steps that out of which there is absolutely nothing new there's no I mean of course you could say there's different prioritization and caliber ization of resources but but what is really new here is is one word that in Obama's last counterterrorism strategy only occurred once and in this one I I think it's on almost every 21 of the 25 pages the word is Iran and despite the fact that it's claimed that Iran is the world's central banker of terrorism not Saudi Arabia this is counter mounded by the US State Department's own terrorist list 61 organizations only four of which have ever claimed to have received any funds or support from Iran and the rest majority of them are funded and and and supported by Saudi Arabia and Qatar all right Jenna that's all the time we have this edition of our program that was our extended version I hope you enjoyed it we'll see you next week ends remember crosstalk rules
