1
00:00:01,606 --> 00:00:03,508
CHAMBER WITH OVERPAID SPOILED

2
00:00:03,508 --> 00:00:07,278
BRAT ANCHORS THAT DO NOT DO

3
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:08,413
THEIR JOB.

4
00:00:08,413 --> 00:00:13,384
AND JOINING US IS JOE.

5
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:16,053
AND HE AND HIS WIFE VICTORIA

6
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:18,690
CAME TO A CHRISTMAS PARTY AND

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,858
SHARED A DRINK TOGETHER AND

8
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:22,126
TALKED AND LAUGH.

9
00:00:22,126 --> 00:00:25,296
SO MUCH NEWS WAS MADE IN THE

10
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:25,663
INTERVIEW.

11
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:26,731
>> INDEED.

12
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,933
>> Sean: YOU SAW THE COVERAGE.

13
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:31,069
YOUR REACTION, WHAT DOES IT SAY

14
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:33,237
TO THE AMERICAN CONSUMER ABOUT

15
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:35,606
THE NEWS SFRAE IN GENERAL IN

16
00:00:35,606 --> 00:00:36,474
THIS COUNTRY?

17
00:00:36,474 --> 00:00:39,444
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WHITE

18
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:41,212
HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER AND

19
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:42,480
THE CONDUCT OF THE PEOPLE AND

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,684
LOOK AT THE ABSENCE OF COVERAGE

21
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:48,820
AS YOUR SHOW LAST NIGHT.

22
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,788
IT IS CLEAR THAT AMERICAN

23
00:00:50,788 --> 00:00:52,590
JOURNALISM IS DEAD, DYING AND IN

24
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,825
THE COFFIN.

25
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:55,693
THEY ARE NOT JOURNALIST.

26
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:57,895
THEY ARE PEOPLE WITH AN AGENDA

27
00:00:57,895 --> 00:00:59,630
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO FIND

28
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,665
SOMETHING OUT.

29
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:02,200
THEY WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ON

30
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,468
THEIR OWN.

31
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:05,269
IT IS AN EXAMPLE AND IT IS

32
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,974
A SAD, SAD DAY.

33
00:01:09,974 --> 00:01:11,909
>> Sean: JOE, WE HAVE HAD

34
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,012
MASKING SURVEILLANCE ABUSE AND

35
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:17,315
LEAKING OF RAW INTELLIGENCE AND

36
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:19,484
SAMANTHA POWER, AND THEN THE

37
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:20,718
BIGGER SCANDAL.

38
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:23,788
RUDY GUILIANI IS RIGHT.

39
00:01:23,788 --> 00:01:26,891
HILLARY COMMITTED FELONIES AND

40
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:30,228
OBSTRUCTED JUSTICES.

41
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:33,264
JAMES COMEY AND LORETTA LYNCH

42
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:34,832
RIGGED THE INVESTIGATION.

43
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:37,735
AND TURNS OUT HILLARY IS PAYING

44
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:39,370
A FOREIGN NATIONAL TO USE

45
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,805
RUSSIAN SOURCES THAT TURN OUT TO

46
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:44,575
BE DEBUNKED AND THAT FALSE

47
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:46,144
POLITICAL DOCUMENT AND DESZIER

48
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:50,581
IS USED FOR A FISA WARPT TO SPY

49
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:52,650
ON AN AMERICAN IN A TRUMP

50
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,051
CAMPAIGN.

51
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:56,721
THEY ARE SILENT ON THE BIGGEST

52
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:58,156
ABUSE OF POWER AND SCANDAL IN

53
00:01:58,156 --> 00:01:59,057
THE COUNTRY.

54
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:01,325
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THAT

55
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:05,430
JUDGMENT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

56
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,633
IT IS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THE

57
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:12,270
MUELLER PROBE IS ILLEGITIMATE.

58
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,939
AND THE ATTEMPT TO INTERVIEW OF

59
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,174
THE PRESIDENT UNITED STATES.

60
00:02:16,174 --> 00:02:18,509
THERE IS NO DOUBT AT ALL THE

61
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,645
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE REFUSE TO BE

62
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:22,080
INTERVIEWED BY THEM.

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,648
IT IS CLEAR THAT ARE MUELLER AND

64
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:26,150
THE DEMOCRATIC THUG ARE ACT

65
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,952
NOTHING BAD FAITH.

66
00:02:27,952 --> 00:02:30,088
THEY KNOW THE PRESIDENT UNDER

67
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:33,658
THE DEPARTMENT OF RULES CAN'T BE

68
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:34,058
INDICTED.

69
00:02:34,058 --> 00:02:35,760
AND THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,527
INDICT HIM.

71
00:02:36,527 --> 00:02:38,729
THE OFFICE OF MUELLER WAS

72
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,665
CREATED BY ROB ROSENSTEIN

73
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:41,065
ILLEGALLY.

74
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:43,134
AND ALL OF THIS LEADS TO THE

75
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:49,207
ULTIMATE CONCLUSION THAT THE

76
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:49,974
PERPETUTION OF THE INVESTIGATION

77
00:02:49,974 --> 00:02:53,377
BY MULLER IS DOING GRAVE DAMAGE

78
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:55,480
TO THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN

79
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,215
POLICY AND GRAVE DAMAGE TO U.S.

80
00:02:57,215 --> 00:03:00,518
LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE OF THE

81
00:03:00,518 --> 00:03:05,790
THUG- LIKE TACTICS USED IN THE

82
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,390
MANAFORT CASE.

83
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,060
AND AFTER WATCHING THE DEPUTY

84
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,262
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED

85
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:13,164
STATES, ROD ROSENSTEIN ACCUSE

86
00:03:13,164 --> 00:03:15,133
CONGRESS OF TRYING TO EXTORT HIM

87
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:19,036
AND OTHERS IN THE DEPARTMENT BY

88
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:20,638
CONDUCTING LEGITIMATE

89
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:22,039
CONSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT.

90
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,576
I WOULD SAY BETWEEN MUELLER AND

91
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:27,011
ROSENSTEIN, AND THE ABSENT

92
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,080
ATTORNEY GENERAL, GOD BLESS HIM,

93
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,616
WE HAVE A SERIOUS CRISIS IN

94
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:34,051
AMERICAN FEDERAL LAW

95
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:34,752
ENFORCEMENT.

96
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:35,786
>> Sean: I AGREE.

97
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:41,159
I THINK IT IS IT A BIGGEST

98
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,995
ABUSE.

99
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:47,198
AND HE WOULD BE A WITNESS ON

100
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:47,965
THAT PART.

101
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:50,234
AND ROD ROSENSTEIN, WE TALKED

102
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:52,670
ABOUT THE FISAN APPLICATIONS

103
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:58,276
THAT RELIED ON UNVERIFIED AND

104
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:00,011
DOSSIER PAID FOR BY HILLARY

105
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:00,378
CLINTON.

106
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:02,446
THEY NEVER TOLD THE JUDGE IT WAS

107
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:04,315
PAID FOR BY HILLARY.

108
00:04:04,315 --> 00:04:06,384
AND IF THERE ARE FALSE

109
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:09,921
INFORMATION PRESENTED TO A FISA

110
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:12,223
COURT, HE IS IMPLICATING HIMSELF

111
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:14,759
WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD NOT BE

112
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,159
EXTORTED.

113
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,295
>> OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM FOR

114
00:04:17,295 --> 00:00:00,000
ROB ROSENSTEIN AND HE HAS
