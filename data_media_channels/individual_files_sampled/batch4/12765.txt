from met with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week in a confab that lasted over two hours ever since then there have been conflicting reports of what happened during the exchange according to Russian sources Putin and Trump began the meeting by tearing off their shirts to compare their pectoral muscles a competition which the Russians say Putin clearly one with rippling pecs that were able to make his nipples rise and fall both individually and together the New York Times a former newspaper carefully reported every claim by the Russians and even consulted a Russian body language expert I'm actually not making this part up the experts said Putin completely triumphed over Trump though whether he was referring specifically to the pet contest was not specified in The Times article or if it was it was obscured by the fact that I was wrapping fish in the paper while I was reading it according to sources within the Putin camp the meeting continued with an arm wrestling match which resulted in the Russian president winning control over the state of Arkansas as well as free lap dance privileges at several roadside gentlemen's clubs off the interstate between San Antonio and Albuquerque the Russian sources say Trump was forced to beg for mercy from Putin after Putin quote showed strength like great Russian bear causing many females to faint in admiration unquote a CNN panel discussing the Russian reports agreed that Trump had degraded the office of the presidency by not developing his biceps prior to the armwrestling match Chris Cuomo called for an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians in order to throw the contest and CNN reporter Jim Acosta demanded from put him on camera right this minute so that everyone could see what a dynamic journalistic presence he was a cost to added that his not being on camera was a threat to the First Amendment since no one can see him according to the Russian sources President Putin scolded President Trump for sending out mean tweets about the American media he explained that that was not as efficient as poisoning reporters with plutonium and pushing them out of windows according to the Russians President Trump took careful notes throughout the exchange and said he wished he had thought of the plutonium thing himself sources the Putin camp said the meeting ended with President Trump swearing allegiance to the Russian government and hoping he could count on getting as much help in the next election as Putin had given him in the last one and promising to consult with Putin on all major decisions in the future CNN reporter Jim Acosta reacted to this report by calling for a full investigation into why he wasn't on camera American officials completely denied the Russian version of events they said Trump and Putin arranged a ceasefire in Syria then Trump told Putin stop mucking with American elections or he'd knock them into the middle of next week the officials did however confirm the Trump took notes during the part about poisoning reporters with plutonium and said they look forward to their next confrontation with Jim Acosta trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan this is

did you and the reaction you get I know it's like you get it women women fall for this stuff what can I say women like who knows what women are yeah I know you do have to make an effort absolutely you know I want to tell I want to tell a brief story maybe it's not so pretty but I'll tell it anyway in my memoir the great good thing I talk about you know I've said this on the air before I lived two lives and one in what life from the age of my birth to the age of 28 I was out of my mind miserable was twisted I was unhappy and then really miraculously I turned that around you can read the whole story I won't tell it here but during this time one of the things I was was I was a fake I would fake I did no sculpt schoolwork for the first several years of my life I did no sport and I never read the books that I was assigned so like you know Moby Dick a book I've now read three times never read it and yet I took tests on Moby Dick I went to discussions on mummy you know it was incredible I got through it how did I do it here was my Khan okay I had a con the con was this all you have to do is say something shocking and nobody will notice that you haven't read the book if you don't have anything you don't have this stuff you're talking about so you come out Moby Dick great classic you say I think it's overrated I think Moby Dick is overrated only takes one sentence right and now they're on the defensive and it never occurs to them say oh yeah what happened is on page fifty you know they don't it doesn't occur to me to test your knowledge or in peace art so long and boring this worked every single time it only takes one second to say Oh John F Kennedy you know that bullet that bullet could never have done what it did you know and it takes it takes hours to prove the bullet pretty done exactly what it did because people don't know what they don't know they don't know the information they don't have and this is how you know and look we do it on the right you know there was that thing about the pizza gate it only takes a second to say Hillary Clinton is peddling children for sex right and it's so out of this world that it sounds believable somehow who would say something like that if it were true how do you disprove it how do you disprove the pizza store you know is selling children in a tunnel underneath the White House or whatever the hell it was you know it's very very hard to do if you say something shocking oh this works by the way at the highest levels of thought if people say to you you know very soon very soon science is going to prove that the self doesn't exist it's simply a matter of chemicals and electricity it takes one second to say that it's nonsense it is nonsense as a person sitting there proving to you that he doesn't exist and that he that he can tell that he himself yourself is a hallucination there's a difference between a hallucination reality and he who is a hallucination can tell the difference between hallucinating rot but it takes forever forever to prove that it's not true this Russian thing okay you know now they've got this story and it's a story I I admit it's a story it's a small story but Donald Trump jr. and Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner were suckered into a meeting with this Russian lawyer and some music promoter in England who was connected to the Trump in some weird way said said oh she has information that is part of according to this latest email this part of a Russian attempt to get stuff on Hillary Clinton and support Donald Trump now nothing came of this right she the the lawyer herself says she was this Russian allure says she has no connection to the Kremlin that doesn't mean that much because everybody in Russia with any power whatsoever has some connection to the Kremlin Christmas where all the power in Russia is okay but they sat down at this meeting obviously nothing happened really the whole thing was some kind of dodge to get in and talk about this Magnitsky act which basically keeps Russians from you know banking here which is their whole point in purpose in life and they keep saying it's about Russian adoption the Russians struck back against this act by preventing Americans from adopting Russian children you know fine whatever they had a meeting it didn't mean anything six weeks from now I promise you you are not going to care about this anymore because the summer will be over and then real news will start happening again and they'll stop running the stuff they only run this stuff they only time this stuff because they knew Trump had a successful trip and they're bringing it out now I'm sure they've sat on it until now and it's just it's not like it's nothing but this idea that oh now we have the smoking gun let me ask you this if the Trump campaign if the Trump campaign were colluding with Russia the Trump campaign were colluding with Russia why would Donald Trump jr. care about an email saying they had information from the Russian government if they were colluding with them they'd already have the information they would already have the information clearly they just got suckered into this nothing meeting and they look like they look a little Three Stooges you know I mean probably the kid look these guys weren't politicians I'm not I'm off the hook you know and it does it break the law you know this country is so over regulated that you can't brush your teeth without breaking a federal law but this is it's highly questionable whether they broke the law the law says the law says you cannot a campaign can't receive money or anything of value from foreign national so was this something of value obviously they received nothing of value usually those laws are meant to say you can't funnel Russia can't funnel campaign France anybody can't funnel money through this campaign but I just you know to me to me this news the thing that I want to go back and talk about and this will lead in to James O'Keefe we're going to stay on Facebook and YouTube so you can watch O'Keefe I think he's an important figure right at this moment and I think he has a chance also he should have a chance to talk about to defend himself basically against what the left is saying about him but to me the incredible thing that has been coming out over this last week is the difference who the left is who the left is in Hamburg you had these riots these are the left burning Mississippi to the ground leaving people there destroying their work their shops hurting injuring people hurting cops Bill DeBlasio the mayor of New York leaves his city while there is a vigil for this murdered police woman right this this woman who's sitting she's a mother of three she's sitting in a car in a gang-infested area and somebody just walks and blows her away and build the Blasio is joining the fight cheese joining the resistance in Hamburg and this mayor is about to get reelected he's going to get reelected I mean there's nobody to oppose and there are no Republicans left in New York a police officer yesterday I don't think we have his name I don't think he gave his name a police officer went on a rant and he posted it online take a listen to this because this is the voice of a guy who has dedicated his life to keeping you safe to keeping the bad guys from hurting you no matter what color you are he doesn't care what color you are he just cares who's the gudid who are the Sheep and who the wolves he is out to corral the wolves that's his job he's watching this go on and it here's part of his reaction the one thing I want to know is where the hell are all the celebrities now where is all the sports teams wearing my PE stuff with their hands up don't shoot people where allows you right now why is it every thug every career criminal every piece of garbage lowlife scum of the earth gets the attention when they're shot and killed for breaking the law but threatening others the victimizing people when they're shot killed by the police they become heroes their families become millionaires we got a New York City police officer mother of three out there sitting in a gang-infested precinct sitting there in a high visibility post to deter crime she's just sitting in a vehicle and this coward walks off and shoots her right now hey that's a victim of course these morons will swing it that this guy wears a you know I misunderstood you victim of of the of the system and he was angry at the police and others will say it's the police's job the risks are there they know the risk till they get killed and get killed that's a person that chose that job to make a difference that's a mother of three children she went to work and didn't come home an honest man out in the street who has just lost a colleague and here's what the left is talking about so president humph I mean in keeping with this right in the same theme here President Trump goes and makes a speech in Poland where he talks about Western civilization where the Western civilization has the will to survive the people are waving American flags and they're chanting his name and they're cheering for him here is Jeff Zeleny who is now I guess he's now with CNN but he used to be with the New York Times he is the guy who famously when he was the political reporter of the New York Times asked President Obama I got a chance to ask the president United States a question and his question was what enchants you about being present in the United States this is that clown right this is the guy they give a Pulitzer Prize to this guy and here's what he said listen carefully to this because this tells you everything about where the left is what he said about the defense of Western civilization I would argue that this speech is one of the the best speeches in terms of a thematic and staying on message and sort of offering a worldview that he's giving it and the setting was interesting it was in a Krasinski Square in Warsaw you know thousands and thousands of people were waving American flags in Polish flag so this is not a speech he could have given really anyplace else and this is a white America America first kind of speech he was offering a very stark view actually about you know the about migration about immigration and other things it was very it wasn't a modern a speech if you will it was sort of a throwback speech but he was offering a sense that you know be afraid of what is happening in the world now this is a Steven Noah written speech he's one of his a top of policy advisors here and was praised in a lot of corners they probably could have given that speech I hear in America so it wasn't a modern-day speech it was a throwback speech which implies the Jeff Zeleny knows where the future is going and what is in the past knows that the past was one thing in the future will be another thing and this is the oldest socialist lie of all the social of Communists in Russia the Soviet Union were justified in persecuting people and killing people on mosque because they knew where the future was going and these people were in the way that was their justification that history would justify them because history worked in a scientific way if you want to see the comic version of that watch the Coen brothers Hail Caesar where the Communists call themselves the future and they're constantly talking they're trying to convince this stupid actor played by George Clooney oddly enough that they know the future and the futures works in a very specific way so that's the first assumption the second assumption was he couldn't have made this speech in America because here in America we're living in the modern world we're looking what he means that he couldn't have made this speech in the offices of CNN could he have made the speech defending Western civilization in your neighborhood could he'd have made it in your theater all these people who showed up for Donald Trump's speeches wound up around you know lined up in winding around the corner and all these places all over America could even made the speech there of course he could have he just couldn't have made it to Jeff Zeleny for Jeff Zeleny it's the past because he knows the future this is the thing Western civilization and oh and the other thing of course was this white America America first white America he slipped that in there they can't hear the idea that black America that brown America that Lady America could not participate in the values the successful brilliant freedom loving values that were first formulated by white males the idea that these values aren't suitable for everybody the idea that if your tribe discovers fire I can't use fire because it's your tribe because it's your tribe and I don't want to step outside of my tribe and use your lousy fire so I'm going to live in the darkness this is the madness of the left and meanwhile we had Linda's sir you remember calling for jihad against Donald Trump and the left same left who thinks that Western civilization is a code word for whiteness same left Time magazine runs his piece that says women's March organizer Linda saucier spoke of jihad but she wasn't talking about violence sorcerer herself compared herself the Martin Luther King by the way she said she was just walking in the steps of Martin Luther King like when he called for jihad Marc Lamont Hill the college professor who has just become really an angry angry man he says he tweets out that people disagreeing with Linda Sarsour clearly don't understand what jihad means how could we be confused about with gee how where we fools how could we be confused legal editor of BuzzFeed Chris Geiger hey you people scare sharing Linda Sarsour speech read the transcription which I just made because you're all trash misquoting her so bill dis Blasio is in Hamburg protesting Welland New York City police officer lies dead in his town has and their subways are falling apart and Linda Sorcerer's jihad is just calling for you know that it's just an intellectual struggle a spiritual struggle and Western civilization is a racial how on earth I mean do they believe they can sell do they believe that we are going to be confused by all this talk let's play it one more time Bailey all this talk they believe we're going to be confused by this that's it pay no attention to the trashing of Western civilization pay no attention to the celebration of jihad pay no attention to the riots in Hamburg while a police officer dies in the mayor's city pay no attention the Russians are coming the Russians are coming and you know this is this is the benefit of owning the culture this is the benefit of owning the news did every guy O'Keefe all right we got O'Keefe this is why I want to bring on James O'Keefe today this is the benefit of owning the news James O'Keefe is obviously the award-winning journalist and writer who has started project Veritas the project Veritas action he has he has done all these hidden camera you know Andrew Breitbart used to stand up at the end of the speeches and hold up his phone and say if you have a phone like this meaning a camera phone you are a journalist obviously James O'Keefe has pulled this to a new level he's exposed Planned Parenthood's racist policies he caught them on the phone agreeing to concentrate on aborting black children I mean amazing amazing stuff I the obviously the acorn expose that really virtually destroyed that organization and now he's gone after CNN is says he's going after the mainstream media James how you doing been a long time I haven't seen you since the NRO cruise I think it was yeah we were on that National Review vote and I was giving a presentation on voter fraud great to see you again it's nice to see you too and you certainly have gotten yourself into more trouble I just always yes always so let's start with this I mean one of the things that the newsmen that they left loves to do is they love to take guys like you or Fox News or Rush Limbaugh and demonize them to the point where all the left has to do is speak your name and it seems to refute the points that you're making so all the leftover does is they say oh that's Fox News oh that's James right that's right right so they put you in this position and and so I I wanted to bring you on to let you to you talked back into that let's start with this you've gone after Planned Parenthood you went after ACORN you went after NPR why are you now going after you say you're just starting with CNN right is that right right yes why are you going after the news media you know you're someone who I likes to bring up Andrew Breitbart named up a lot I do too because he was a kind of a medium enter on the media is everything the media dinesh d'souza says the Republicans have are they're afraid of the terrifying power of the presses narratives the ability for the media to shame the Republican Party if not it's not based on any type of truth or or sort of a reality it's based in shame and the political left has a sort of monopoly on virtue in this country they're the good they're the evil we're good it's not just right and it's not just logic it's we're good and very evil and as long as the media is able to create this false dichotomy where they're literally wanting to kill poor people and hate black people it's not true but a lot of the media is able to create these artificial uh constructs then we're not governed the right way so what we want to do is expose the media's real political motivations and it's Russia stuff that we exposed in the CNN was was it was pretty earth-shaking because it showed senior CNN leadership we're doing things they knew that was in their words BS in order to make profit and to advance this agenda and that's that's the reason why we're doing the Andrew bright part of the media is everything James the media is everything the media has more power than we think it does and we're at a crossroads in our country where that power is now shifting away from the established media towards the citizen press well that is exactly with it my my next question because I agree with everything that you just said I mean I obviously they have created an atmosphere an intellectual atmosphere where it's almost hard to think because if you're not a leftist you're a racist if you're not a leftist you're a sexist if you're not a leftist you're hateful that's the way basically they have taught everybody to think and and even sometimes either right talking about this so you were just said at the end of what you were saying you said the power is shipped away do you believe that do you believe that the mainstream media is is being beaten back to an extent we're at the tipping point and we're not yet we haven't quite crossed it the CNN MSNBC NBC News ABC News still has power a certain type of power they have power over certain people the Republican Party they have power over the Republican part they don't power the voters the voters voted for Trump despite the media I don't think Trump had any a single cheerleader in any media and and they when Trump won despite them but they have power over Mitch McConnell the media has power over Paul Ryan I mean incredible power in fact if you're a Republican in DC you have 17 microphones points in your face any any human being that cares about their own survival and self-interest would would with it takes an enormous amount of moral courage living in Washington DC I can't live in DC and I'm sure you could neither to live in that environment and be and be pummeled by this gaggle every day of people who why do you hate black people why do you want Susy to die and take away her wheelchair it can't you can't do it so the media has certain types of power and you're seeing this shit this this this incredible thing that's happening where where the voters are becoming even more disenfranchised they have no one to speak for them the New York Times is I said on Twitter they will go down with this ship they will go down with the Russia story even if it's fake they're so invested in it that if they were dinesh d'souza said again he said only one person is going to be victorious the media or Trump it's one or the other it's a fight to the finish they say they have they're so invested in this Russia crap that they will do anything even if it means inventing a new Nixon and manufacturing the crime they'll do anything to win so you're seeing a lot of things happen right now so what is Veritas to my organization we are exposing the media with hidden cameras and CNN is only part one that's well that's what I wanted to ask you again I mean CNN CNN is great because it has this has this aura being the kind of V news station V cable news station even that anymore yeah that was kind of nasty of you to do that to them but but of course the big fish the big fish are the time CBS NBC ABC I mean the people don't realize that the network's have ten times the viewers of cable stations have I don't want it I don't want to give anything away but are you going to move on to these bigger fish yes I'll just say that okay all right we've already we've already we already have footage on our hard drives secured in multiple locations so if anything were to happen to me it'd come out people people say well do you save the footage someplace other than what I say yes so footage exists securely and we already have it and we're and I would say you're going to see stuff come out certainly in the fall maybe sooner we do undercover work so the moment we release a tape it burns the person on the inside so we can we can release a tape now but it would prevent our journalists from getting even more the bond afield tape you saw with CNN some of that materials was got literally five days we released whe where was a four month five month investigation so undercover work is tricky because you always have to sort of pull the plug and sometimes it's more of an art than a science now now the other thing I mean I noticed after you did the that powerful acorn expose the New York Times basically buried that story they wouldn't cover it they wouldn't cover they wouldn't covered and finally they did but then you got arrested during one of your escapades and they put they put your mug shot above the fold on the front page and I and I remember saying I was at PJTV at the time and I remember saying if the thing that he does isn't a big story why is his arrest a big story that doesn't actually make any sense so they have put in a lot of effort into demonizing you and of course the big thing that they always say is the tape is edited this is heavily edited tape and so so answer that because I hope tonight even on my Twitter feed where people are sympathetic I hear people say well he does edit his tapes you know that I mean I that that's the greatest lie it's a deceit of epic proportions this is no longer fake news it's now a contamination it's it's twisted oh I mean I'm a Roger Simon wrote a great piece here it's a more amazing that I could write and he writes that all videos are basically unfairly edited as Sergei Eisenstein and the early Soviet directors demonstrated it's the nature of the media some things get left in and some things get left out but the different but of course if you look at the actual aesthetics of it what we show is true we don't take anything out of context the word edit is isn't isn't is an obfuscation I mean the New York Times edits their articles you don't get to see the anonymous sources you don't get to get to hear the intonation of the source talk to the reporter you don't get to you don't get to dig paint a portrait with adjectives and words what Veritas does is show you the videotape it's inherently real it's more real than any other type of journalism and what I've discovered in doing this is this whole Veritas isn't just exposing corruption and fraud and deceit we're exposing the whole matrix we're exposing the the greatest lie the lie that for example teachers unions care about children and then we got the teachers union president say we hate children's all about the money it's they can't they cannot accept the reality that we deliver so the the instant of any organization individuals survival so they call me names I'm a criminal on this on that but when it comes to the editing thing all journalism is edited the difference is Andrew we leave in what they owe MIT we we we show the things they don't want you to show so really the it's not so much that we edit they would argue that we're reductionist that we that well but but teachers unions are good because because they give money to the Democrats they just have this this cognitive dissonance this this rationalization so they it comes out what he edits the film well there's no there's no out of context edit Van Jones did indeed say that Russia is a nothing burger was he talking about but but does what they'll say but but but that's bad that you're showing the American people that because the American people will come to the wrong conclusion about Trump it's a rationalization that that is that you're saying is banjo when Van Jones said that was he talking about the entire Russia story or is he talking about a specific story he's talking about the Russia the right he says well this is a hidden camera we approach of an Jones this is the big story one of the big stories on CNN and he goes oh Russia's just a nothing burger there's nothing you can do about that right and and that's a little open to interpretation what does he mean he was explaining himself awkwardly on Anderson Cooper the other night and it was really hilarious to watch but but the point to you is there's a conflict of visions between us you and I citizens who believe that the American people deserve to have unfiltered raw true information and the New York Times in CNN which says no no don't show the American people the raw information because the raw information might lead them to vote for Trump might lead them to vote against the teachers union might lead them to say we need to reform welfare in other words the mainstream media depends upon selective editing and and obfuscation and camouflage through flowery written articles and Veritas presents you raw unfiltered information so the answer of course they have to say that don't look at that tape they will look at that tape and that's what this all comes down to it comes down to a war and a conflict of visions between these two competing forces you've actually been kind of persecuted for doing this haven't you I mean that's not that's obviously you haven't been hung upside down and tortured but but you've been given a really hard time by actual legal authorities isn't I've been arrested I've been falsely accused in Louisiana it was it was not true I always say to the people on Twitter I say well you're a convicted criminal I said yes I have a Class B misdemeanor a Class B misdemeanor Bob Kramer's a convicted felon he's best friends with Barack Obama and Martin Luther King was a convicted criminal throughout the twentieth century history is replete with examples of people who pursue justice and are falsely accused and you think the left would understand this concept of falsely accused this is this isn't this is like they don't understand like I don't understand we're doing something that has never been done before we're taking hidden camera right we're combining with crowdsourcing technology and we're distributing it to the masses no one has ever done that the way that we're doing it and and we I stood falsely accused Malizia the prosecutors resigned in disgrace they destroyed my evidence if I was doing this to the NRA I'm sure that I we would have Nobel Peace Prizes Academy Awards but but I know I I choose to go after the sacred cows yeah and I I don't complain about it I believe that dumb I believe that it's more it's kind of more fun to go against the grain but it is where this is is it well let me ask you this is a final question are you hopeful at this moment I mean the mainstream media one of the things I really like about Donald Trump is what he has done to the mainstream media he has become a voice all these people who as you say have been demonized by the mainstream media he has become their voice they think they think it's a glitch a bug that he attacks them most Americans I think think it's a feature that he attacks them right this moment are you hopeful that the grip they have on our national conversation can be actually broken that's a great question here's my two-fold answer number one I think that Trump's has the ability to transcend his presidency by going after the media because we are at a turning point I think I think things are lined up for a pendulum shift right now away from the 50-year centralization of social control but the mainstream media has over it with the propaganda war I mean is what it is it's a propaganda war they've been doing this since the 1920s the idea that you can filter information the New York Times and by the way we can't hint we may have some of these media people on tape saying what I'm saying right now like in their own work their motivation cool they do not want you to see the truth because if you do if people could see Lois Lerner from the IRS saying let's go after those concerns because we don't like them there would be riots in the street to forget the hearings it forget that constant forget the the political game and ship of DC people would people would say I don't believe in the system anymore and and the media hasn't has an interest in protecting the status quo so when you get these people on tape saying that and Donald Trump tweeted our embedded or videos Instagram Donald Trump is press secretary of the United States Sarah Huckabee Sanders said go watch these project Veritas videos when you have a president who has the brass balls to say hey media calling you out this has the potential to transcend his presidency and expose the media once and for all so I think things I am hopeful but also Andrew I know that the New York Times will go down with the ship they will they will die on the cross it doesn't matter how fake or unreal the Russian stuff is they will they will never ever admit they are wrong um I don't know if you saw the thing I did with the Washington Post where I frame the retraction I frame the front-page retraction this is my this is my way my way of showing the American people that you're going down with the ship I mean I put the retractions front and center so people can see it well James I think really this is truly important work I think you made the right choice in who you're going after and I'm looking forward to see what you do next and I hope you'll come back and talk about we'll be back I promise you all right thanks a lot today it's good to see you thank you all right this stuff I like you know it really does matter I mean this thing he's absolutely right that this is where the battle is being fought as a Dean thought and a level of information not just in the news media but also in the Academy also in Hollywood and personally I think run were really at a turning point I think we have a true chance of winning that doesn't mean we will win but I think we have a chance of any stuff I like we got to do stuff I like running out of time I saw a ghost story a ghost story which is this new picture by David Lowery whatever the pictures he does done them some bodies them Saints with it oh he did Pete's dragon - he did since these famous 8:24 is the studio they're the ones who did the witch X Makana green room moon like this this is part of this new small intellectual ghost story trend the witch the babadook was one it follows was one X Mac and a kind of one sort of more science fiction a green room which I haven't seen but which I heard is really tense and interesting so but ghost story is different and it is variety the trade paper called it intermittently successful and I would say that that is right if there is a moment in the middle of this picture that really works and basically what it is is it's Casey this is not giving you this is just the premise Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara a young lovers he dies and he comes back as a ghost who looks like a Halloween joke he is just a sheet with eye holes in it that's what he is and he follows run around and it is a story about loss about the meaning of life about whether or not as one spectacular scene with will old image a musician gives a speech about how no matter how we try to be remembered the meaninglessness the nihilistic meaninglessness of life outstrips all our efforts but while he's saying that the ghost is watching and which kind of throws the whole speech into doubt you know and so it's got some really really interesting stuff in it it's self-indulgent and it has a scene close to the opening where Rooney Mara eats a pie the camera stays in one place did you see this awesome nihilism I hope you I hope you'll see it because I'd like to know what you think I mean the camera stays in one place and she eats this pie for what must be five minutes I thought I seriously thought my wife is going to just get up and walk out it was like watching paint dry and you could have accomplished every single thing in the scene in 30 to 40 seconds I mean every single emotional beat every single piece of meaning could be so it's kind of it's kind of annoying and I want I wanted to bring it I couldn't find the clip of the guy speaking so but it did as you know I love ghost stories I am I just cannot tell you how much I love them and ghost stories kind of came into their own right about the turn of the last century right around 1900 with Mr James and people like that some of the great and mostly in Britain some of the Great British ghost stories if you've never read the monkey's paw you should really read the monkey's paw tree you've seen the movie the monkey's paw if you've seen this story embedded somewhere but if you've never read it you really should read it but the ghost story is coming back and that's a really interesting thing a lot of times they say the ghost story is connected to World War one and all the death and people trying to try to deal with all the death of World War one I don't believe that's true at all I believe it has to do with the rise of what I've been calling scientific logic not the rise of science but the rise of scientific logic scientism it's sometimes called science has given us all the great blessings in the world all the cures all the technology all the wonderful things that we have the way we travel all this stuff but but it has done it at a price and the price has been that is this said to us in order to believe in our science you have to stop believing in anything else you have to believe that we have this camera and therefore everything is a nail and I believe that logic is collapsing because when if you follow that logic to its end it would mean that you don't exist essentially it would mean that you have no will free will it would mean that you have no spirit it would mean that it would mean that all your observations are in doubt they don't mean anything that was basically the story that was sold to you that your observations are not reliable when so often your observations are reliable and the only way you can tell they are unreliable is because often they're reliable otherwise how would you know they were unreliable if they weren't so often reliable all the logic of scientism is collapsing and that's why I think ghost stories are making the kind of a comeback in the very recently there have been some terrific ones paranormal activity I think is virtually close to being a classic and as this is the moment I'm just show you there's one moment from Paranormal Activity to me it's one of the great things about ghost stories I don't like horror stories I like ghost stories because of moments like this one what I love about this is that one line there they've laid out powder because this invisible creature keeps visiting them he says this footsteps in but there's no footsteps out I mean that to me is how it ghost story works oh yeah and she says oh my god that's you know that's all you need that's all you need there are footsteps in the footsteps out and you get when you first watch that movie a chill goes up your spine when he says this I know we're going a little long but let me I kept James on because he was really interesting let me just play this one scene from the ring another of my very favorite ghost story movies that has come out recently this is the opening sequence it's based on a Japanese novel in a Japanese film but the actual American film with Naomi Watts is the best version of it that I read I read the book saw the Japanese film this is the best version of it so there's two teenage girls watching television and bored out of their minds here it is any idea how many electro waves are traveling through her head every second I got a better one have you heard about this videotape that kills you when you watch it we're going to do tape regular tape people run it I don't know we start to play it and it's like somebody's night and someone this woman comes on smiling right see anything through the screen and it means it's over your phone right someone knows you've watched it what they say it you will die in seven days in exactly seven days later George somebody from my there I told you what's your problem I love this stuff you don't have to show anything nothing has to jump out of you nobody has to bleed you tell a ghost story and she says I'm in it i watch that thing I am in Echo's story and the thing works every step of the way the rest of the movie it's really a terrifying film and yet there's not a lot of gore not a lot of blood in it not even a lot of boo scares which I find very cheap one of the reasons I ate horror movies I hate them jumping out of me all right we got to go good
