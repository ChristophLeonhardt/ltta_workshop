1
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:15,366
>> HISTORY MADE OVERNIGHT AS

2
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:16,033
DONALD TRUMP WELCOMES NEWLY

3
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:20,171
FREED AMERICAN HOSTAGES FROM

00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:24,676
NORTH KOREA, FOREIGN POLICY

5
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:25,143
ANALYST SKINNER.

6
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:28,613
AND THANKS FOR BEING HERE ON A

7
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:31,416
HISTORIC MORNING.

8

WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER AND

9
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,824
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, IT WILL BE

10
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:40,191
DEBRIEFED.

11
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:40,859
WHAT DO WE EXPECT TO LEARN?

12
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,829
>> AN IMPORTANT ASSET.

13
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:45,496
LET ME SAY IS YOU WILL HEAR

14
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:48,933
THROUGH THE DAY, A HISTORIC

15
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:49,667
MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES AND

16
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:53,004
THE WORLD, FAMILIES OF THOSE

17
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,541
HELD, FREED AMERICANS AND FOR

18
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:01,045
THEM AS WELL.

19
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:01,779
WITH THAT SAID, INCREDIBLE HUMAN

20
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:04,949
INTELLIGENCE ASSETS FOR THE

21
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:15,093
UNITED STATES AS THE WHITE HOUSE

22
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:15,827
PREPARES FOR THE SUMMIT WITH KIM

23
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:16,928
JONG UN.

24
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:17,629
WE DON'T HAVE THE QUALITY AND

25
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:18,263
QUANTITY OF ON THE GROUND

26
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:20,932
INTELLIGENCE IN NORTH KOREA THAT

27
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:26,471
WE HAVE IN OTHER NATIONS DUE TO

28
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:27,238
COUNTRY OVER MANY DECADES.

29
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:36,447
THERE IS A LOT WE DON'T KNOW.

30
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:37,181
WHAT THESE FORMER HOSTAGES CAN

31
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:37,916
TELL US IS THEIR IMPRESSION OF

32
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:38,583
THE STATE OF THE POLITICAL

33
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:41,419
CULTURE IN NORTH KOREA, WHAT

34
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:43,254
NORTH KOREANS ARE SAYING, WHAT

35
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:46,157
THEY THINK ABOUT THEIR

36
00:01:46,157 --> 00:01:46,891
GOVERNMENT, HOW THE GOVERNMENT

37
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:53,164
INTERACTS IN SUBTLE WAYS WE

38
00:01:53,164 --> 00:01:53,631
CAN'T PERCEIVE.

39
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:54,365
THAT WILL BE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE

40
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:57,368
INFORMATION AS THE TRUMP

41
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:06,210
ADMINISTRATION CRAFTS ITS

42
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:06,644
TALKS.

43
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:07,345
TODD: YOU SAID THIS COULD BE

44
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:08,947
DONALD TRUMP'S REAGAN MOMENT WAS

45
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:09,479
WHAT YOU MEAN?

46
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,214
>> THE FINAL DECADE OF THE COLD

47
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:14,319
WAR WAS AN INCREDIBLY TENSE. GO,

48
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,788
THERE WERE CONCERNS NUCLEAR WAR

49
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:19,057
MIGHT HAPPEN, THE US PLACED

50
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:20,959
INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR FORCES IN

51
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,328
EUROPE AT THE END OF 1983 BUT

52
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:26,898
EARLIER THAT YEAR THE UNITED

53
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:31,502
STATES WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE

54
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:31,936
SOVIET UNION.

55
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:32,870
REAGAN AND THE GENERAL SECRETARY

56
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:38,309
TO GET THE RELEASE OF TWO SOVIET

57
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:39,043
PENTECOSTAL FAMILIES WHO LIVED

58
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:39,677
IN THE BASEMENT OF THE US

59
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:44,949
EMBASSY IN MOSCOW FOR ALMOST 5

60
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:45,683
YEARS AND THAT WAS QUIETLY DONE.

61
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:50,254
IT WASN'T REVEALED UNTIL 1990

62
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,957
AFTER THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION.

63
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:55,560
IT PREFIGURED DISARMAMENT TALKS

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,027
THAT CAME LATER.

65
00:02:56,027 --> 00:02:56,594
WITHOUT HUMAN RIGHTS

66
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:57,295
INTERVENTION I DON'T THINK WE

67
00:02:57,295 --> 00:03:00,565
WOULD HAVE HAD A END TO THE COLD

68
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:00,832
WAR.

69
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:07,839
TODD: PRES. OBAMA NEGOTIATED THE

70
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:08,573
RELEASE OF BOWE BERGDAHL, GAVE

71
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:09,207
UP A LOT TO GET HIM BACK.

72
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:09,941
WE DON'T KNOW THE PARTICULARS OF

73
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:10,508
THIS RELEASE AND THIS

74
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:19,617
NEGOTIATION BUT DOESN'T SEEM

75
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:20,351
DONALD TRUMP GAVE UP A LOT, THIS

76
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:21,085
WAS A BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR THE

77
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:21,519
TALKS IN JUNE.

78
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,053
HOW DO YOU RESPOND?

79
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:22,620
>> YOU HAVE IT RIGHT.

80
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,254
I DON'T HAVE ANY INSIDE

81
00:03:23,254 --> 00:03:23,855
INFORMATION ABOUT THE

82
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:24,589
DISCUSSIONS BEHIND THE SCENES TO

83
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:27,892
SECURE THEIR RELEASE BUT IT DOES

84
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:33,131
APPEAR THAT THIS IS SOMETHING OF

85
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:33,831
A PRECONDITION FOR THE LARGER

86
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:39,103
TALKS THAT WILL TAKE PLACE BUT

87
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:40,938
IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE ESSENCE

88
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:41,372
OF DIPLOMACY.

89
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:42,073
DIPLOMACY HAPPENS THROUGH A

90
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:44,075
SERIES OF MOVES AND THE

91
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:50,515
POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IS CENTRAL

92
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:52,950
TO GETTING A TECHNOLOGY

93
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,484
NEGOTIATION FORWARD.

94
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,586
THE DISARMAMENT TALKS ARE ABOUT

95
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:56,954
DISMANTLING THE TECHNOLOGY

96
00:03:56,954 --> 00:04:07,065
PROBLEM

97
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:08,266
DISMANTLING THE TECHNOLOGY

98
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:08,866
PROBLEM OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND

99
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:09,600
ICBMs IN NORTH KOREA BUT IT IS

100
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,334
NOT THE REAL PROBLEM WITH NORTH

101
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:10,635
KOREA.

102
00:04:10,635 --> 00:04:11,369
IT IS AN ISOLATED DICTATORSHIP

103
00:04:11,369 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT OPPRESSES PEOPLE AND THAT
