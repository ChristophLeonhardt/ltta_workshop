1
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:10,461
>> Steve: THIS IS A FOX NEWS

2
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:10,761
ALERT.

3
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:11,395
THE SENATE JUDICIARY

4
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:13,231
COMMITTEE HAS RECEIVED FBI

5
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:14,499
FINAL INVESTIGATION OF JUDGE

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,633
KAVANAUGH AS SOMEBODY AT THE

7
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:16,534
ADMINISTRATION TALKED TO THE

8
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:17,235
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" SAID

9
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:19,437
THERE IS NOTHING, JUDGE, IN

10
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:20,638
THE REPORT THAT CONGRESS IS

11
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:24,408
NOW HOLDING THAT WOULD

12
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:25,076
ESSENTIALLY DERAIL HIS

13
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:27,111
NOMINATION.

14
00:00:27,112 --> 00:00:28,513
>> WELL, WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT

15
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:31,115
AND I WOULD OFFER A SLIGHTLY

16
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:31,582
DISSENDING VIEW.

17
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,550
I WAS DISAPPOINTED THEY

18
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:33,351
DIDN'T INTERVIEW JUDGE

19
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:34,719
KAVANAUGH AND DR. FORD AND A

20
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,753
FEW MORE PEOPLE.

21
00:00:35,754 --> 00:00:37,555
NOW, THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T

22
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:38,389
WANT JUDGE KAVANAUGH

23
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,023
CONFIRMED, WHETHER THEY

24
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:40,525
DON'T WANT HIM CONFIRMED

25
00:00:40,526 --> 00:00:41,292
BECAUSE OF A PER SESSION

26
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:42,994
THAT HE IS IDEOLOGICALLY

27
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:44,929
AGAINST THEM OR BECAUSE THEY

28
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,830
REALLY BELIEVE THE

29
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:47,031
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM NOW

30
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:48,966
HAVE MORE AMMUNITION AND

31
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,234
MORE DOUBT TO SAY WHY WAS

32
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:51,769
THE FBI HELD BACK?

33
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,906
WAS THE FBI USED AS A

34
00:00:54,907 --> 00:00:55,907
POLITICAL INSTRUMENT YET

35
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:56,207
AGAIN?

36
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,708
WHY WEREN'T THEY JUST

37
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:58,409
ALLOWED TO INTERVIEW WHOEVER

38
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,711
THEY WANTED, INCLUDING THE

39
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:01,812
TWO PRINCIPLES, JUDGE

40
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:06,450
KAVANAUGH AND DR. FORD?

41
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:13,257
THOSE EELINGSZS ARE GOING

42
00:01:13,258 --> 00:01:13,291
THOSE AELINGSZS ARE GOING

43
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:13,324
THOSE ALLINGSZS ARE GOING

44
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:13,357
THOSE ALLEGGSZS ARE GOING

45
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:13,391
THOSE ALLEGATZS ARE GOING

46
00:01:13,392 --> 00:01:13,424
THOSE ALLEGATIO ARE GOING

47
00:01:13,425 --> 00:01:13,824
THOSE ALLEGATIONSRE GOING

48
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:13,858
THOSE ALLEGATIONS A GOING

49
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:13,891
THOSE ALLEGATIONS AREOING

50
00:01:13,892 --> 00:01:13,925
THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE GNG

51
00:01:13,926 --> 00:01:14,725
THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE GOING

52
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:15,226
TO STICK.

53
00:01:15,227 --> 00:01:15,860
AINSLEY: THEY MIGHT HAVE

54
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:16,794
WATCHED THE HEARINGS AND

55
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:18,029
SAID WE WERE GOING TO ASK

56
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,696
THOSE EXACT QUESTIONS.

57
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:21,632
THERE IS NO MORE THAT WE

58
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:21,999
NEED.

59
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,701
>> Judge: YOU MAY WELL BE

60
00:01:23,702 --> 00:01:24,001
RIGHT.

61
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:25,636
IT'S AWKWARD TO CRITICIZE A

62
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:26,771
REPORT I HAVEN'T SEEN AND

63
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:28,773
PROBABLY WILL NEVER SEE.

64
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:30,741
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO LEAK

65
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:31,175
SOMETHING.

66
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:31,842
BRIAN: BLOOMBERG TOLD THEM

67
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:32,977
THE WHITE HOUSE TOLD THEM

68
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:33,477
NOT TO.

69
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:34,679
>> IF BLOOMBERG'S REPORT

70
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,280
SOMETHING CORRECT AND IF

71
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:36,948
SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S REQUEST

72
00:01:36,949 --> 00:01:39,584
FOR THE MEMO FROM DON MCGAHN

73
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:40,585
THE WHITE HOUSE LEGAL

74
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,220
COUNSEL TO THE FBI SETTING

75
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:46,991
FORTH THE PARAMETERS OF THE

76
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:48,259
LAST INQUIRY WILL NOT BE

77
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,527
MADE PUBLIC THESE ARE

78
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:50,595
LEGITIMATE CRITICISMS.

79
00:01:50,596 --> 00:01:52,530
I ALSO WANT TO NOTED HOW

80
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,531
DIFFICULT THIS IS BECAUSE I

81
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:54,565
KEEP HEARING THIS FROM

82
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:56,801
FRIENDS IN D.C.

83
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:59,170
FOR THE COURT ITSELF, WHICH

84
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:00,304
NOW IS VIEWED IN THE MINDS

85
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:04,208
OF SO MANY AMERICANS AS JUST

86
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,443
ANOTHER POLITICAL

87
00:02:05,444 --> 00:02:05,843
INSTITUTION.

88
00:02:05,844 --> 00:02:07,545
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD A PEEP

89
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:09,146
FROM ANY OF THE 8, BUT I

90
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:10,647
KNOW SOME OF THEM AND I HAVE

91
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:11,682
HEARD FROM SOME OF THEM.

92
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:13,985
NOT DIRECTLY BUT THROUGH

93
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:15,319
OTHERS, THEY ARE JUST NOT

94
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,787
HAPPY AT THE WAY THE COURT

95
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:18,789
ITSELF AS AN INSTITUTION HAS

96
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,924
COME OFF.

97
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:21,025
BRIAN: JUDGE, TELL ME IF

98
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:21,592
THIS IS RIGHT.

99
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:24,028
THEY WEREN'T HAPPY IN 2000

100
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:25,830
WHEN THEY DECIDED BUSH VS.

101
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:26,297
GORE.

102
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,432
THEY WILL NOT HEAR WHEN JOHN

103
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:29,233
ROBERTS PRESERVED OBAMACARE.

104
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,068
>> THESE THINGS HAVE A WAY

105
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:31,535
OF DISSIPATING.

106
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:33,237
RIGHT NOW JOHN ROBERTS IS A

107
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:37,942
VERY UNHAPPY CHIEF JUSTICE

108
00:02:37,943 --> 00:02:42,280
HE WAS WELCOME

109
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:42,313
HE WAS RELCOME

110
00:02:42,314 --> 00:02:42,346
HE WAS REACOME

111
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:42,847
HE WAS READYME

112
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:43,881
HE WAS READY TO WELCOME

113
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:44,682
BRETT KAVANAUGH WHOM HE

114
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:46,217
KNOWS BECAUSE HE WORKS THERE

115
00:02:46,218 --> 00:02:47,184
WITH OPEN ARMS.

116
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:49,453
NOT HAPPY WITH THE

117
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:51,889
PERCEPTION OF THE SYSTEM.

118
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,090
HARSH LIVE CRITICAL TREATING

119
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:54,492
THE COURT AS A POLITICAL

120
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:54,892
INSTITUTION.

121
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:56,460
DOES THE COURT EXIST TO DO

122
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,028
THE PEOPLE'S SPHWHIL

123
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:57,662
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

124
00:02:57,663 --> 00:02:58,529
THAT'S WHAT CONGRESS AND THE

125
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,463
PRESIDENT EXISTS FOR.

126
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:01,465
THE COURT EXISTS TO

127
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:02,500
INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION

128
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:04,402
AND PRESERVE HUMAN LIBERTY.

129
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:05,202
AINSLEY: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

130
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:06,237
NOW THE SENATORS WILL READ

131
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:07,138
THIS REPORT?

132
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:08,906
WILL THERE BE A VOTE ON

133
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:09,607
SATURDAY AND IS THERE

134
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:10,408
ANYTHING THE DEMOCRATS CAN

135
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:11,275
DO TO STOP IT.

136
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:12,343
>> I DON'T THINK THERE IS

137
00:03:12,344 --> 00:03:13,077
ANYTHING PROFESSIONALLY THE

138
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:14,378
DEMOCRATS CAN DO TO STOP IT

139
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:15,913
UNLESS THEY HAVE THE VOTES.

140
00:03:15,914 --> 00:03:17,281
WE WERE TALKING DURING THE

141
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:18,349
BREAK, AND SOME OF THEM MAY

142
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,750
NOT MAKE UP THEIR MINDS

143
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:20,918
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.

144
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,119
BUT KNOWING MITCH MCCONNELL,

145
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,321
I DON'T THINK HE IS GOING TO

146
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:24,655
BRING THIS TO THE FLOOR ON A

147
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:26,924
SATURDAY EVENING OR A SUNDAY

148
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:28,059
MORNING, WHENEVER IT'S GOING

149
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,193
TO BE NOW WITHOUT HAVING A

150
00:03:29,194 --> 00:03:30,861
PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF HOW MANY

151
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:32,296
VOTES HE HAS.

152
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:32,897
STEVE: JUDGE, YOU WERE

153
00:03:32,898 --> 00:03:36,434
TALKING A MINUTE AGO ABOUT

154
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:38,436
HOW BLASEY FORD'S ATTORNEYS

155
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:40,304
WERE SAYING THIS IS NOT A

156
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:41,038
LEGITIMATE DECISION BECAUSE

157
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,740
THEY DIDN'T TALK TO THE TO

158
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:44,208
TWO PRINCIPLES, THE FBI.

159
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,543
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HOW

160
00:03:45,544 --> 00:03:46,877
MANY TIMES HAVE WE HEARD THE

161
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:48,746
DEMOCRATS SAY THIS IS A JOB

162
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:52,416
INTERVIEW FOR A LIFETIME

163
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:56,654
TENURED JOB WHY DIDN'T MIX

164
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:58,856
OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY

165
00:03:58,857 --> 00:04:00,391
COMMITTEE ASK THE QUESTIONS

166
00:04:00,392 --> 00:04:01,359
FOR THEMSELVES?

167
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,626
IF YOU HAD A QUESTION FOR

168
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:03,694
THOSE PEOPLE WHY DIDN'T YOU

169
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:04,829
ASK THEM WHEN YOU HAD A

170
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,162
CHANCE.

171
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:05,930
>> I THOUGHT THE PROCEDURE

172
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:07,164
WAS AWFUL.

173
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:08,199
STEVE: IT WAS STILL THEIR

174
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,866
OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THE

175
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:09,233
QUESTIONS.

176
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:11,001
>> OF THE FIVE MINUTE SERIES

177
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,269
OF QUESTIONS BY THIS

178
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,404
PROSECUTOR, WHO SOUNDED LIKE

179
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:15,206
SHE WAS TAKING A DEPOSITION

180
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:17,074
IN A CIVIL CASE.

181
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:18,376
BRIAN: SHE NEVER ADJUSTED.

182
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:20,177
>> SHE NEVER DID.

183
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:20,978
IT WASN'T UNTIL SENATOR

184
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:22,011
GRAHAM WHO MUST HAVE THOUGHT

185
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,881
IN HIS OWN MIND, ENOUGH IS

186
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:24,215
ENOUGH.

187
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:26,417
I'M GOING TO ASK THESE

188
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:27,051
QUESTIONS.

189
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:28,886
BRIAN: AN ELM BOW LIVING

190
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:29,253
ROOM.

191
00:04:29,254 --> 00:04:29,820
AINSLEY: EVERYONE IS

192
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:30,454
CRITICIZING HER.

193
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:31,989
