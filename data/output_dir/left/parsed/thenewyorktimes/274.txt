I would have never imagined
that Aleppo would be
described as a wounded place.
Living this now,
you actually see
the wounds happen in real life.
And I think for me, that’s
one of the most painful things
about being from Aleppo is
to have that kind of shame
and have that burden that we
actually destroyed our country,
or watched it being destroyed,
even if there was no way
that we could have stopped it.
The wounds are extremely deep,
to the point where I don’t
know if they will be mended.
So the last time I was
in Aleppo was in 2011.
And went for a couple of
weeks and kind of said
goodbye to my grandmother’s
home and our home and Aleppo
in general.
I went every single day
to my grandmother’s home,
and I photographed
everything in it.
All of the pieces,
all of the rooms,
the balcony, her furniture.
I did feel like
this was going to be
the last time I was going
to be with my grandmother
in her home.
And it was.
Watching the war happen,
that was very, very difficult
because you had extreme
urban warfare happening
in a historic city.
What happened in Aleppo
is there was a resistance
against the regime.
There were protests.
Many, many, many
peaceful protests.
The protests were met with
bullets by the Syrian army.
After the bullets
came, the tanks came.
After the tanks came,
the airstrikes came.
During the war over who
would occupy Aleppo,
it’s separated into two
halves, the east side
and the west side.
The east side, where
the old city was,
it was occupied
by the opposition
to the regime and the
west side by the regime.
It was a military divide.
It was very arbitrary.
And when you’re from there,
it’s very, very jarring,
and it’s very, very painful.
And all I’m thinking about is
where’s my house on this map.
Where is my grandmother’s
home in this map.
The regime conquered
eastern Aleppo,
and now has taken
over the entire city.
The city has been gutted.
It’s almost like an earthquake
to the social fabric
of the country.
The vast majority
of the destruction
happened in eastern Aleppo.
And it’s in the old city, so
our historic souks were burned.
The minarets of the Great
Mosque, it collapsed.
And so you’ve lost
these, sort of, icons.
If you’re from Aleppo,
there’s certain things there
that are like your compass.
And those things are gone.
And I don’t even
know what it would
feel like to walk in Aleppo
not being able to have those.
But rebuilding is a
part of human nature.
We rebuild after natural
disasters, after wars.
I hope as an
architect that Aleppo
will be rebuilt in a way that
honors the memory of what
has happened there.
I do believe that
we need to keep
the memory of the loss
visible, honoring the dead
and honoring the loss
of our cultural heritage
and honoring our homes, that
once were, with dignity.
