way out John Conyers is at last count 1363 years old he was actually present not only for the signing of the Declaration of Independence but he was signing he was present for the signing of the Magna Carta but doesn't remember any of the acts he's senile Conyers has been hit with allegations of sexual harassment he had to make settlements with congressional money meaning our money and earlier in the week you recall Nancy Pelosi defended John Connor she said he was an icon and then she suggested that he should stay and Al Franken should stay but Roy Moore should go and everybody on the rights and find will vote for Roy Moore then so the Democrats are trying to put the genie back in the bottle now now they're trying to suggest that they actually do have a standard when it comes to sexual harassment and sexual assault Nancy Pelosi the house Minority Leader reversed herself today here's what she had to say about John Conyers well the the allegations against congressman Conyers as we have learned more since Sunday are serious disappoint disappointing and very credible it's very sad the brave woman who came forward or owed justice I pray for congressman Conyers and his family I wish them well health ever congressman Conyers should resign as dean congressman Conyers has served at our Congress for more than five decades and shaped some of the most consequential legislation of the last half century however zero tolerance means consequences for everyone no matter how great the legacy is no license to harass all right discriminate okay there's John Conyers you can hear his body being dumped under the bus as we speak bump that was John Conyers just going right under that bus james Clyburn who's the head of the Congressional Black Caucus he came out today and said the Conyers should go but only after spending a week saying that John Conyers had been elected so why should he have to go the Democrats handled listen about the worst possible way they should have said all of this last week when the allegations first broke if they wanted to hold the moral high ground I said earlier this week the Democrats had basically given up the moral high ground and that was a serious problem for them that if you give up the moral high ground then it's very hard for you to argue that the Republicans should somehow take that moral high ground for Roy Moore for example or Donald Trump the Democrats are trying to set up a new standard which I think is a good standard the sexual harassment assault will not be tolerated but they're still allowing Al Franken to stay so that's gonna be the next shoe to drop there's a sixth allegation against Al Franken today apparently Al Franken did some event in 2006 gave a wet sloppy open mouth kiss to some woman on stage she also grabbed another woman's ass this is Al Franken's mo we here at the Daily wire have been hearing rumors that there is yet another woman who is going to come forward in the near future talking about a couple of decades ago Al Franken acting in sexually inappropriate ways in any case Al Franken's allegations are credible he has not denied them he has in fact admitted them and so there's no reason why John Conyers should go but Al Franken should stay there really it's it's difficult to imagine a rationale other than Conyers was in the job when he did this stuff in Al Franken was not in the job when he did this stuff but bottom line is that I think Franken will end up going to I think when Franken does go then it's yeah I think if and when he does go that's gonna put a lot of pressure on Republicans to dump over Roy Moore or at least not to seat him in the Senate I could be wrong on this it could be that Al Franken stays and then you have to ask yourself why is it the Conyers go in Franken State Kirsten Gillibrand of New York was asked today a Franken should resign from the Senate she said quote it's his decision which means no he shouldn't resign he should stick around so one of the things that you have to ask his wife Librans going and why Franken is staying one reason is because Conyers is or Conyers going in Frankenstein one reason is because Conyers is as I say older than Methuselah he's actually set world records for his age he's in the Guinness Book but and so he's not really very valuable at this point like they actually want him out of the House Judiciary Committee because the House Judiciary Committee will oversee any impeachment hearings they don't want kook old Conyers presiding over that so they want him gone Franken is much younger he was considered a possible 2020 candidate because we live in an insane world so they don't want to dump him over quite so quickly if Frankenstein Moore will not only get elected who will be seated in the Senate if Franken goes then there's a good chance that even if Roy Moore is elected he won't be seated in the Senate but a lot of it depends on how democrats decide to treat all this now obviously these are not the only sexual allegations and these are not the only sexual allegations that are out there in breaking news literally this minute Texas Republican Joe Parton says that he is not going to run for re-election after a nude photo of him was posted on social media that was revenge porn as you recall there was a situation in which he had been he was separated from his wife and he was sleeping with another woman and texted a picture of his ding-dong to this lady and then she revealed it in public so now he's saying he's not going to seek re-election so we're seeing a huge turnover in Congress right now and it's not just just restricted to Congress of course now we are finding out that the now we are finding out all the specific allegations about Matt Lauer so Matt Lauer who was basically fired from today yesterday this is according to variety calm he once gave a colleague a sex toy as a present it included an explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her which left her mortified okay if she never reported that and the company never did anything about it that's insane that's insane I mean you know how you know brazen you have to be to do that to a colleague get somebody a sex toy and right now like first of all my guess is that what he told her to do with the text why she probably told him to do to himself but it's really just horrifying on another day according to Variety he summoned a different female employee to his office and then drops his pants showing her his wing wing after the employee decided to decline to do anything visibly shaken he reprimanded her for not engaging in a sexual act he would sometimes quiz female producers about who they'd slept with offering to trade names and he loved to engage in a crass quiz game with men and women in the office f marry or kill in which she would identify the female co-host that he most like to sleep with so this is a two-month investigation from variety there's also an allegation that he did that while he was married he asked an intern into his office and then forced her to have sex with him she calls it sexual assault on Wednesday that NBC announced that Lauer had been fired from today I guess that they saved 25 million dollars in his annual salary so he just blew a lot of money in order to harass his employees but the allegations are pretty are pretty astonishing they're pretty astonishing according to according to one of the former producers they say there are a lot of consensual relationships but that's still a problem because of the power he held he couldn't sleep around town with celebrities are on the road with random people because he's Matt Lauer he's married so you'd have to deal with in his stable where he exerted power and he knew people would never complain apparently he even had his office was in a secluded space this is amazing and he had a button under his desk that allowed him to lock his door from the inside without getting up this afforded him the assurance of privacy it allowed him to welcome female employees and initiate inappropriate contact while knowing nobody could walk in on him according to two women who were sexually harassed by Lauer according to sources it extended to an hour traveled on assignment for NBC apparently he paid intense attention to a young woman on his staff he found attractive focusing intently on her missions he asked the same producer to his hotel room to deliver him a pillow this is part of a pattern apparently he would call various women who worked for NBC late at night to his hotel room while covering the Olympics so good stuff from male our I mean the guy is basically like the he's like a James Bond villain he actually has a button in his office that locks the door behind you does he have a is a hatchet man named odd-job who's able to actually behead bad employees with his hat it's pretty incredible stuff I will admit that here at the Daily wire offices I also have a button under my desk that locks the door but that's mainly to keep Michael moles out but it's it's really like the idea that nobody at NBC knew this was happening there's such a lawsuit against NBC that's burgeoning here there's such a lawsuit that's brewing really really amazing stuff so when these scandals continue to play out and the less anyone has standard the us the more of this there will be as I said yesterday the media actually does seem to have a standard Garrison Keillor of NPR has has basically been fired from his job over allegations of sexual harassment he denies those allegations I don't think it's sexual harassment to force somebody to listen to the Lake Wobegon tapes I think that's just torture I think they actually used that at Gitmo but apparently Garrison Keillor was not above average and therefore he has been fired from NPR as well so the fallout continues in politics the question is gonna be what our standard is are we going to hold the same standards that the media hold for themselves the answer looks like no a Conyers at least is on his way out which is a good move he should go Franken should go Roy Moore should go all these people should go they should all go and and there should be a write-in campaign I know it's a little bit late for that in Alabama but that's just because the Republicans didn't do the right thing the first time they should have moved throwing more out of this position in the first place okay so I want to talk to you about some of the good things that the Trump administration is doing because they are doing some good things believe it or not and one of those good things is a big shake-up that's supposed to take place inside the cabinet I'll tell you all about that but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at tripping calm tripping calm is the world's number one site for vacation rentals so I'm in a weird position when I go on vacation with my family because we really can't stay at hotels not because I'm

really it's a great service and I and I really appreciate them so check that out ok so when the White House is about to make some major shakeups and I think these are all good shake ups they're about to get rid of Rex Tillerson Rex Tillerson has been a garbage Secretary of State he's really been inactive he's not done much he up a 20 million dollar a year salary text on mobile to go over to the White House and be badgered by President Trump so he gotta give him credit for that one but he's been at odds with Trump over foreign policy because Trump is moving to the right on foreign policy and Tillerson seems to be you know center-left on foreign policy he has apparently described the president as a quote/unquote moron they differ in their approach to North Korea's missile testing and Iran's nuclear program Tillerson wants to uphold the Iran nuclear deal Trump wants to abrogate it Trump is right Tillerson is wrong so the plan in place is the Mike Pompeo who's over at CIA and is it has a good relationship with President Trump would move over to state that would be a definite upgrade over Rex Tillerson whom I opposed not only for his Russian ties but because I did not trust him on foreign policy he also had strong ties to oil regimes in the Middle East and and so Tillerson would go he'd be replaced by Pompeo and then Pompeo would be replaced at the CIA by Senator Tom cotton which is a really interesting move it opens up another Senate seat so it's a little bit risky Arkansas is definitely a red state and the Republicans would have an advantage going in but it opens up another Senate seat that really would not be open Tom cotton I believe is still in his first term in the Senate in Arkansas he's a relative newcomer but he has a really good record and cotton obviously also has a military background so he'd move over to CIA Pompeyo would move over to the State Department it's not clear if Trump has actually made the move yet or greenlit the move yet but it is clear that he hasn't liked Tillerson right he's been tweeting about Tillerson openly I talked about this over just a few weeks ago October 1st Trump tweeted quote I told Rex Tillerson our wonderful Secretary of State that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with little Rokit so this is all a staff shake-up overseen by the chief of staff John Kelly no and I think that it's a good move I think that somebody who doesn't like Trump obviously the State Department is leaking this at Tillerson allies probably leaking this but this would definitely be an upgrade and it's pretty obvious the Tillerson doesn't want the job he said earlier this year quote I didn't want this job I didn't seek this job my wife told me I'm supposed to do this so he wants you out Trump wants him out so get him out and that's that's totally fine with me I think that's a good move by the Trump administration other things that the Trump administration that are that are good are that are happening right now so Trump is about to get his tax reform bill this looks like this is going to pass today John McCain announced that he would vote in favor of the tax reform bill I've gone through some of the pros and cons of the tax reform bill it's bad for people like me and California high income earners who live in high tech states doesn't work well for us it is a across-the-board tax cut for everyone else it's it's an across-the-board tax cut in small measure for everyone else there's some deductions that go away or minimize the the child tax credit goes away or is minimized there there's a proposal on the table from Mike Lee to expand the child tax credit that's not a bad move but overall the bill is worth voting for it lowers the corporate tax rate that's something that definitely needs to be done all the focus on individual tax rates is is for political gain but the reality is that individual tax rates are not killing business investments in the country right now individual tax rates are too high for sure by a long shot but it's the corporate tax rates at 35 percent that are driving people not to hire it's driving people to to minimize their their business investment because they don't want to be taxed at 35 percent so Trump is a Trump is out making the case yesterday who's making the case on the road in st. Louis it's it's a good sign they get tax reform passed because here's the fact if they can't pass tax reform they're passing zero things nothing gets past if they don't pass tax reform and they also need to pass tax reform in order so that there's any momentum going forward on issues like immigration or budgeting if they're able to get tax reform through without having to make any serious concessions with spending then they are than they are in solid shape for legislation in the next year if there is any legislation to be had here's Trump in st. Louis yesterday making the case for his tax cut the beating heart of our plan is a tax cut for working families that's what it is this is not good for me me it's not so I have some very wealthy friends not so happy with me but that's okay you know I keep hearing Schumer deuces for the wealthy well if it is my friends don't know about it he's right about that I mean if you are somebody who is you know wealthy if you're if you're doing well then and you live in New York then you're not gonna do well under this tax plan I wish it were an across-the-board tax cut and not just you know tax cuts for people who earn below a certain amount but it is better than nothing for sure and the main tax cut is not on the individual side it's on the corporate side the Republicans should have been making this case all along it's why the tax cut is unpopular because it was pitched as an individual tax cut and it really isn't an individual tax cut it really is much more a corporate tax cut the Senate adopted a motion to proceed last night triggering a formal floor debate over the tax reform bill all 52 Republicans voted for it including all of the so-called moderates and there's a new tax reform study that is out today showing that the CBO analysis shows that everyone's taxes will be reduced guy Benson has a good write-up on this over at townhall comm he's been all over this so the this basically he shows that the real real numbers show that your taxes would be reduced by a not insignificant amount particularly for the middle class like proportionally speaking you are going to you're going to see a drop in your a drop in your taxes much more if you're in the middle class than you are if you are at the upper end of the tax bracket so right now if you look at you know various scenarios I'm looking at a chart right now that talks about the impacts of the Senate's amended version of the tax cut and tax job back from the Tax Foundation if you look at for example let's take Sophia and she had $165,000 combined married two earners two kids they deferred $20,000 toward retirement contributions they itemize their their tax deduction under the current law they pay about $30,000 in taxes the proposal odd they pay about $27,000 in taxes so they have an 8% reduction in their tax burden every tax bracket basically sees a reduction in their tax burden of more or less quantity one of the things that was pretty spectacular and hilarious about the about the way the Democrats are treating this is that they are they're lying about whether this is a tax cut or not and then they're suggesting that it's not good for the middle class but what they actually want to do is raise taxes on the middle class right Ted Cruz had a debate with tape with Bernie Sanders the other night on CNN about tax cuts and he points out that Bernie Sanders likes to talk about he doesn't want to hurt the middle class he's a liar everything Bernie Sanders wants to pay for he's going to have to pay for with massive tax hikes and Cruz points this out quite correctly so you're a single euro says you you're gonna pay some more you're a small business owner he said pay some more and the reason is there aren't enough millionaires and billionaires know there's Haven for all the social is what okay so he is exactly right and not only that the Democrats are so bollixed up that they even refused to denounce socialism itself right they can because Bernie Sanders is a socialist Murray account well same debate she's talking with Cruz and Cruz asks her can you two find the difference between a Democrat and a socialist and she refuses to do it what is the difference between a Democrat and a socialist on taxes well you know Ted I really thought about this issue of you trying to divide the Democrats but you know we're a big tent party and there's room for Bernie and there's room for me okay know that okay and then you want us to believe that you guys aren't gonna raise taxes obviously this is your your goal is to raise taxes Trump is is winning on this issue tax cuts our winning issue for Republicans they always have been winning issue for Republicans their winning issue for JFK they were winning issue for Reagan they were winning issue for yes Bill Clinton who had to reduce taxes after raising the capital gains tax and they're winning issue for george w bush right tax cuts are always popular even if people say they don't like it right now that's because of the media coverage and bad PR done by the administration and by congress but once it takes effect and your check is bigger in the mail then it's going to be a benefit to you so the tax cut is good policy and good for President Trump for not watching it right Thank You mr. president for not batching this up there there are some problems inside the tax reform bill I wish that Trump would work to fix them but this is a lot better than nothing no no question this is better than nothing well I want to talk a little bit more about Roy Moore the fall out there President Trump doing some bad things with regard to Britain and the hypocrisy of some in the media about sexual harassment but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at blinka so I know that if you listen to this show you are addicted to information it's one of the reasons why you like the show is because we just give you tons and

you'll like it even better once you have an app that allows you to go through books at the speed of sound blink is calm / pen check it out blink is calm / then okay so the Democrats the the real reason you know I mentioned earlier a little bit that that Nancy Pelosi had thrown John Conyers under the bus the real reason that Nancy Pelosi threw John Conyers under the bus was not just because of Roy Moore and they're gonna pretend they have a standard on sexual harassment it's because Nancy Pelosi is is in danger of losing her speakership to women Kathleen rice Kathleen rice is a Democrat from New York she's quite articulate she's very good at what she does she's much younger than Nancy Pelosi and she basically said listen I'm gonna talk about sexual harassment I want Conyers out I'm gonna fight for this and there are people who are saying that rice should replace Pelosi so he moved to cut her off this is why kathleen rice the democrats to be very smart if they were to move kathleen rice into the top slot and and demote nancy pelosi let's talk about the big elephant in the room and that's why i was done with the meeting i I don't have time for conversations that are not real and I for one I'm not gonna stand silent even in the face of pressure from leadership not to yep and the reason that she is doing that is because she's running for the top slot Pelosi is afraid of her and that's why he that's why she is running away from from John Conyers now so basically don't give the credit to Pelosi for Conyers falling give the credit to Kathleen Rice who's putting all sorts of pressure on Democrats to do this maybe it's for political reasons but whatever the reason that's that's the right thing to do meanwhile if you have any sort of bets down as to who is going to be next in the sexual harassment fallout I think that you know let's just say that the Geraldo Rivera might not be a worse bet the reason for that is because yesterday after the Garrison Keillor allegations in after Matt Lauer was forced out at NBC Geraldo had a bunch of tweets in which he basically defended all of this he said sad about Matt Lauer great guy highly skilled and empathetic with guests and a real gentleman to my family me news is a flirty business I really okay news of flirty business and it seems like current epidemic of sex harassment allegations maybe criminalizing courtship and conflating it with predation what about Garrison Keillor heard well-regarded women in media today suggesting morning shows go to an all-female format that should be as unacceptably retro as the other way around I agree with that but then he says reaction of my tweets today on sex or accident makes clear I didn't sufficiently explain this is a horrendous problem long-hidden harasser czar deviants who deserve what is coming to them often victims are too frightened to come forward in a timely fashion I humbly apologize he did that because Fox News told them dude shut it like what is wrong with you defending mount our like the allegations about Matt Lauer are super serious and news of flirty business is not a good answer okay I did a morning show with a woman who I now work with here at Daily wire Alicia Krauss Alicia's like a sister to me it's not a flirty business like flirting only happens when you want to flirt with your co-host okay I did not want to flirt with Alicia in order to Alicia wanna flirt with me and so that wasn't a thing that's the way that that your business is supposed to work the reason I say Geraldo may be on the chopping block is because Garrison Keillor and the day before he was ousted NPR wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post suggesting that Al Franken should not step down from his position defending Al Franken the next day he was out at NPR Geraldo's defending Matt Lauer he's allegations been floating around about Geraldo Rivera I was I didn't interview with Chris Wallace yesterday for Fox News Sunday I'm gonna be featured on his power player segment on Fox News Sunday I think a week from Sunday and he we turned to each other and we said are we gonna be like the last two guys in media after office is finished there are a lot of guys I think in media who are not doing this but apparently this was an epidemic okay so in other news Roy Moore said something yesterday that it just it shows you how willing people are to believe things I had a long conversation with my good friend David Limbaugh yesterday David and I been friends since I was 17 years old David is one of the nicest guys in in the business somebody who I think is really principled supported Ted Cruz in the primaries voted for Trump in the general election there is strongly supported Trump in the general election he and I disagreed about that and David and I were talking and we talked at length about Roy Moore and he said that he was annoyed by the number of people who are basically saying that it was morally inconceivable to vote for Moore again he made the same argument that he made during 2016 it's a binary call you got a vote from one or the other it's either Doug Jones or Roy Moore and Doug Jones pro-abortion Roy Moore isn't you may think that Roy Moore is a scuzzbag but you know acknowledge that it's a bad choice and you have to make it I've always said I thought that was the strongest argument in favor of more although I think that you know points for honesty although I think that it doesn't wash for me because I think that every you can't treat every election in isolation if we keep saying that every election is the only election that matters then pretty soon very few elections matter because we're just selecting bad guys in every election the whole point of this is that you preserve your character so you can fight another day you preserve your character so you can have the moral high ground and that's important that's my point but I'm not begrudging people who make a different calculation right I think that I understand your argument I just don't agree with it I may not agree with it morally I may not agree with it and utilitarian sense but I understand the argument I'm not gonna pretend that the argument doesn't have some weight it obviously does but what does bother me is all the people who are trying to convince themselves that Moore is innocent right there that Moore didn't do anything at all I think that it is highly unlikely and put it that way very very unlikely that Moore didn't do anything given in fact there are nine women who have made allegations about Roy Moore yesterday Roy Moore was trotting out his latest conspiracy theory and this is what drives me nuts about the partisan hackery of all of this is that if you wildly allege things then people on your own side will buy into it so long as it serves their political purposes here's what Roy Moore had to say about how these allegations came to their ego essentially saying that the people who are trying to stop him are all liberals they're lesbian gay bisexual transgender who want to change our culture the Socialists are behind these allegations okay the two women who are behind the allegations are apparently that behind the main allegations one says that she was 16 when Roy Moore took her out into his car and essentially tried to rape her that's the one with the ear book and then the other woman who came forward and said she was 14 when Roy Moore took her home and tried to molest her both of these women are from supporters they're white straight Trump supporters so no this is not just about the quote-unquote liberal agenda it is about whether Roy Moore did this stuff or not for a lot of these people but as long as you're willing to put everything in the box of conspiratorial ISM you're well you're able to get away with everything and you're seeing that now mores best supporters are moving this direction they can't deal with the cognitive dissonance of just saying Roy Moore may have done some really bad stuff years ago and like really bad stuff years ago but we're gonna vote from anyway which is what K IV the governor of Alabama was honest enough to say now they're trying to rehabilitate Moore and say that all of this is nonsense which again I think this puts us in a very difficult position if you're trying to be intellectually honest here's mo Brooks who ran against Moore in the primaries and lost saying that the yearbook is forged the woman who alleges that Moore signed her yearbook and then tried to rape her basically that that yearbook is forged there are only two they have thirty that room engaged in unlawful conduct one of those is clearly a liar because that one forged the love really more part of a yearbook in order to try to or whatever reason get a Troi more and win the seat for the Democrats there's a lot more to it as to why I believe that the evidence is almost uncontroverted all about whether the yearbook was forced so now you're down to one witness and and you look at the preponderance of the evidence and then you had one Morris denial in it you add his long deeply held Christian beliefs and I just don't think there's anywhere in the world that a jury would agree with the assertions of the Washington Post so the allegations of the yearbook are faked it said that be the weirdest story ever if the yearbook or indeed Forge and there's a second allegation by a woman who has nothing to do with the yearbook so again deal with the cognitive dissonance okay if you want to own it own it if you want to say listen we have to elect bad guys because they're worse guys out there we have to stop own that argument but do not recast evidence do not pretend bad things didn't happen because it's uncomfortable for you to admit that you're voting for a guy who's done some pretty terrible things or who's allegedly done some pretty terrible things okay so meanwhile president Trump who I praised before on policy I was asked by a member of the administration very recently how I thought that the administration was doing overall and what I said was this I said if I had to grade them I give them an a on executive policy I'd give them a C on negotiations with Congress and I give them a D on communication and that seems to be the pattern right and that's that's sort of how today's show is on policy the Trump administration is about to get tax reform done they are about to make some good moves with regard to Jerusalem there's a strong rumor coming out of the White House that the that the administration is about to move the embassy if not movie embassy to Jerusalem in Israel to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel that would be great I have a niece who was born in Jerusalem and her passport just says Jerusalem it doesn't say Jerusalem Israel because the State Department refused to recognize that Jerusalem is a part of Israel even though it has been the eternal and will be the eternal capital of Israel for all of time in any case that all of this is very good policy so a for that in terms of negotiation with Congress again the administration is not totally to blame because Congress had been very fractious but they haven't been able to get major policy stuff done but they're trying and I think tax reform will get through so see on that and then and then D on communication and I'm gonna give you why it's

so the the Trump administration and President Trump he's very gifted at sounding off against his enemies it's what he's very good at okay they put the most flattering spin on it the President of the United States finds enemies and he hits them he doesn't always hit them in the most appropriate way in he hits them in some pretty morally egregious ways he will say things that are not true about them but he's very good at putting his opponents in a box right he hits and he hits any hits until they are down in the corner whimpering that's what he did in 2016 election cycle during the primaries that's what he did during the general with Hillary Clinton it is not enough to make your opponent look like the villain you have to look like the hero in politics if you want to get young people particularly to vote for you it can't just be you saying the other guy is bad it has to be you saying the other guy is bad and this is why he's bad and this is why I'm good ready actually need to make an affirmative case for yourself Trump never makes an affirmative case for the administration instead he only makes negative cases the problem is now if he looks like a villain attacking other villains and young people have the sort of foe cynicism about politics where everyone's a bad guy except Bernie Sanders everyone's a bad guy except Rand Paul right whoever is the most kind of out-of-the-box candidate who is perceived to be pure as the driven snow those are the candidates that that young people like and that's because they perceive them as the heroes of these particular morality plays everyone who votes sees politics as a morality play even people who are 60 you voted for Trump in the last election cycle see more SEC politics is morality play they just see it as a deeply immoral morality plane which Hillary Clinton is the devil and Trump is the devil you know in order to feed the devil you don't I think that was the majority of people who voted in the last election cycle the people who loved Trump were able to somehow fit Trump into the hero box which I don't understand how you could do that in the last election cycle maybe it was just because he was hitting Hillary Clinton that alone gave him the title hero as opposed to sort of antihero in any case what Trump needs to do if he wishes to win the 10 million additional votes that he's gonna need between now and the next election cycle in reelection is he needs to show people that he is not just anti media but that he is Pro truth he needs to show people that he is not just anti radical Islam but that he is Pro truth about Islam he needs to show people that he is not just anti-big government but that he is Pro a limited government view of the future right now that's what President Trump needs to do and if you won't do it then the vice president needs to do it if the vice president won't do it then other members of the administration need to do it the bottom line is that you cannot constantly project your most nasty negative face and hope that you're going to win over young people who are idealistic enough that they will just stay home or vote third party all right this holds true for the other side to Hillary Clinton thought that she when just by bashing Trump it didn't work young people did not show up to vote for Hillary Clinton because Hillary said I'm not Trump and young people said we don't care ok the same thing is true for Trump if he wants to win over people who are under the age of 50 then he's gonna have to actually start making affirmative case for himself unfortunately he's uncomfortable doing that I think he's uncomfortable sort of putting himself out there because it does take a little bit of vulnerability to put out your own views it takes a little bit of vulnerability not to play the villain but to but to try and be sincere about the the views that you hold you know when you go out there I know because I speak on a regular basis when I go out there and I attack when you're on attack there's very little vulnerability when you're on the offensive you're not very vulnerable because the other person is on the defensive but when you put out your own viewpoint when you put out your deeply held beliefs and you subject those to attack and assault that takes some real strength it's harder to do and I think that it's also what wins you the most points in the end if you can do both you can attack where it's necessary to attack and you can prop up a vision build a vision for the country at the same time that's how you win that's what Ronald Reagan did I think in his first tournament with George W Bush said Donald Trump needs to do that Donald Trump is not doing that right now I'm gonna explain what he did wrong yesterday on Twitter and how it's gonna blow back I know they're a bunch of people who are saying it's genius genius Mathematica genius it was not I will explain in just a second but first you're gonna have to go

from tweets out a buncha retweets a bunch of random tweets from these this white supremacist account basically in the UK and it was a bunch of videos of Muslims doing bad stuff and it's not smart and it's not good politics and it's really done a lot of people on the road no look it's just it's secret genius as I heard yesterday from no less than our own Andrew Klavan through the grapevine and Michael moles through the grapevine that this was just it was a work of magnificent unparalleled genius guys who are this close to being fired that is so stupid the reason that this is so stupid is because the what their suggestion was that Trump had tweeted out all of these idiotic videos because Trump was trying to distract from the tax reform debate number one why would you want to distract from the tax reform debate when you're about to win and two if you actually want to distract with something why would you use these videos from this woman who I guess has been jailed but she's been jailed because she was supposedly engaged in hate speech why would you use that as the excuse so Knowles and claim like well he was trying to stand up for free speech in Britain yes I'm sure that's Donald Trump's top priority at the moment is standing up for free speech in Britain or alternatively here's what happened they're a bunch of people who tweet at him at his his username and he sits in the Oval Office and when he sees something he likes he retweets it that's it that's the whole thing you know in which do you think is more plausibility sitting there he's going I have I have a chest strategy to distract from my winning tax reform play my strategy is that I will kill two birds with one stone I will retweet a bunch of random not true videos and in some of these cases the videos and one video particularly apparently was debunked I will retweet all of this stuff and I will do it specifically because I will kill two birds with one stone I will fight for free speech rights if some Rando in Britain and I will also distract from this ongoing tax reform debate which isn't hurting me in any way it's all genius woohoo not only that I will start a fight with Theresa May a political ally of mine in the UK Rachel Risa may as part of the Conservative Party she was part of the brexit party handed like what if you think that this is if you think this is in any way beneficial to Trump you're wrong as I said yesterday the media are a bunch of cats and Trump has the laser pointer point the laser in the right place the laser in the right place there are so many ways in which President Trump could draw real moral contrast between himself and other people this is not the way to do it now he's in an open fight with Theresa May so yesterday Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked specifically about these about the the tweets that Trump had made and here was her answer and that's what the president is talking about is the need for national security the need for military spending and those are very real things there's nothing fake about so the videos are fake but the threat is real okay that you don't get to do this in politics okay you want to know why president that here that the polls show that the media are not trusted with regards how they cover President Trump the polls also show that people trust the media more than they trust Trump Trump is in a great job of tearing down the media he has not done a good job of propping up and it's Ted something true and something real and it's not good for him when he's getting in fights with his own allies yesterday on the floor of the House of Commons the British actually raised a point of order about Trump's tweets here's what it looked like on the House of Commons floor yesterday even doubting Thank You mr. speaker and for exceptionally taking this and you may not be aware mr. speaker nor others in the house but it appears that the President of the United States has in recent moments urbeats retweeting comments from far-right organizations in Britain first highly inflammatory videos including some posted by an individual I believe has recently been arrested and charged relating to certain serious offenses and I wondered whether you have noticed mr. speaker of any intended statement by the Home Secretary or the foreign sector on this very serious matter absolutely I confess I have no advance notice of this matter I am NOT my self one who tends to follow what is said on Twitter okay so there is point aboard in the House comments and Trump fires back he goes after Teresa may the Prime Minister of Britain and he tweets this he says Theresa May don't focus on me focus on the destructive radical Islamic terrorism that is taking place within the UK we are doing just fine um why are you getting a fighter recently she's your political ally why would you do that why is that a useful thing to do they're a bunch of people yesterday saying this shows that Trump's really his game he's really on the ball like well no it doesn't it shows that he's getting in fights with his own allies why is that a smart thing to do and by the way we're not doing just fine on radical Islamic terror I mean there was a terrorist who just killed a bunch of people in New York the other day this is it's it's you know Trump is doing better than Obama in on it no question but just this is useless and it's not setting him up to be the good guy you want him to be the good guy the president people want their president to be the good guy they don't want the president to be a bad guy there's no such thing as a two-term president who was perceived widely to be the bad guy even Richard Nixon in 1972 this is pre Watergate was perceived to be a good guy in 1972 seriously go back and look at the campaign he wasn't just a bad guy who's defeating George McGovern okay time for some things I like and some things I hate and the big idea will try to fit as much of the soon as possible so things I like I started watching mine hunter on Netflix in about three and a half episodes in it is quite good it's very graphic it is rated rqx it's the there's some graphic sex for no reason the graphic sex is completely superfluous to the plot but it's like oh we're Netflix so we're gonna show a naked chick on screen and then there are a couple of crime-scene photos that are pretty graphic I used to work on in DA's office so I've seen worse than this but it's a really interesting show the basis of the show is these two guys from the FBI who that they've never done any serial killer profiling so they decide to go around interviewing serial killers to determine what exactly makes serial killers tick so they can help profile and identify them before they kill again and here's a little bit of the the trailer it's not easy butchering people it's or work physically and mentally I don't think people realize you need to then you know there's a lot more like me do you think so 40 years ago your FBI was founded hunting down John Dillinger now we have extreme violence between strangers we travel around the country and teach FBI techniques to cops you guys mind if I bother you for a minute she was found cuffed and lashed to the bed what people won't do to each other there's nothing people won't do how come we out we should be using every resource we can talking to the smartest people we find from the series is actually quite good and and and very compelling the two main characters in the series are a guy who's kind of a nerdy guy who's very into the vagary of all of this and a kind of hard charging cop type so far also the first three and a half episodes are very good all of the compelling scenes virtually all of the compelling scenes are the interviews with the actual serial killers those are those are pretty interesting ok so so that is that's a show that's worth watching if you can stomach the graphic it's it's one of those shows that I don't think that my wife will enjoy too much but it is quite good if you like Silence of the Lambs is the kind of show for you okay time for some things that I hate or anything I mean ok so this thing I hate is actually a thing I sort of love there's a Michigan Democrat who is running for attorney general in the state of Michigan her name is Dana Nestle and she is now running an ad all about why she is qualified for higher office the reason she says she's qualified for higher office is because she does not have a penis no I am not kidding this is an actual ad that is actually on the internet and is actually running and Israel and this is real life and what the hell is happening in the last few weeks has taught us anything it's that we need more women in positions of power not less so when you're choosing Michigan's next Attorney General ask yourself this who can you trust most not to show you their penis in a professional setting is that the candidate who doesn't have a penis I'd say so some people will tell you I let it be the Democratic that's bridge for attorney general here in Michigan because we can't have an all-female ticket for statewide office in 2018 pundits and insiders are asking can we afford to have a female governor a female Attorney General and a female Secretary of State well I read the news and I bet you do too and it has me wondering can we afford not to now if you want to know more about what I'll do is Michigan Attorney General head to Dana 20:18 dot my goodness but right now I want to tell you what you can expect me not to do have a penis not so you wait I will not have a penis no matter what happens that not happening there will be no penis you know I hope that she doesn't become a transsexual in which case she'd have to add one but in any case I don't want to find people's gender for them and then hey this is a thing now so I guess that the way this is going to work that men are the evil gender females are the great gender we never have to worry about women being corrupt in office or doing anything bad in office or covering up for sexual harassment like Nancy Pelosi for years we won't have to worry about any of those things because they because women don't have penises and penises are bad penises make you terrible which is an amazing thing and the penises make you terrible because I have been reliably informed that there are many women who have penises I've been reliably informed of this Caitlyn Jenner was a woman with a penis how dare are you he's just normative heteronormative okay so yes this is the culture in which we live okay time for a quick exploration of the big idea so one of the things that Trump has been going around saying is that welfare recipients are making more than some people who work their butts off that welfare is a system that actually denigrates work this is true okay the left has been very upset about Trump saying this sort of thing how dare Republicans say that the welfare system benefits people who don't work as much it benefits people who don't work as much and I will show you a chart demonstrating this first here is what Trump had to say about it I know people they work three jobs and they live next to somebody who doesn't work at all and the person who's not working at all and has no intention of working at all is making more money doing better than the person that's working his and her ass off and it's not gonna happen okay so this is a case where Trump is actually doing the right thing right well Trump is saying is I'm standing up for the working person I'm not gonna stand for the deadbeat right I'm not gonna stand for the person who can work but won't so let me show you a chart of how welfare benefits work in the United States so this is the DC ER but this comes courtesy of the Urban Institute in Washington DC Circuit 2014 this talks about tax and transfer benefits for universally available in additional programs for a single adult with two children in 2015 what you see is that if you earn nothing if your wage is zero if your wages zero you will make almost $30,000 in tax and transfer benefits for universally available and additional programs and then you see that it sort of goes down and then it hits a cliff at about a little under thirty thousand dollars when you hit that cliff the total amount drops suddenly it's twelve thousand dollars right so you're making a little under thirty thousand dollars suddenly it's twelve thousand dollars of benefits that you're making so what you end up with and this this sometimes happens is that it is actually beneficial for you to work less right you'd prefer to make twenty six thousand dollars as opposed to twenty seven thousand dollars on this chart if you make twenty six thousand dollars twenty-five thousand dollars you're still pulling in seventeen thousand dollars in benefits so let's say you're making twenty six and you pull in seventeen and benefits assuming forty-three total if you earn thirty or or you earn twenty-eight or twenty-seven and you pull in twelve twenty seven and twelve is 39 so you're actually going to make about the same amount of money for working less and in some cases significantly less money for four for working more these programs are are difficult to administer it's difficult to find the balancing point and it is certainly true that the work requirements that are on welfare need to be strengthened by Congress they should be strengthened because otherwise you have these income cliffs in which we are encouraging people not to work so Trump is not wrong about this the welfare system has been a great a great impetus to people working less over the history of the program okay so we'll be back here tomorrow they're supposed to vote on tax reform either today or tomorrow so we should have some big news for you then i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our
