a 14-year old British boy has been referred to the UK's anti-extremism program after police feared he was being groomed into environmental activism the authorities had been alerted by his teachers who became concern over what's described as his extreme beliefs the teenager known as Aaron had signed an online petition on environmental issues but his parents became increasingly concerned about his online activities with the authorities tracing suspected links back to anti-fracking campaigners he was used as a case study in a report on extremism in the wake of the Manchester bombing as an example of online exploitation into criminal activity but local police later dismissed the links to anti-fracking groups saying he was actually being targeted by a different group environmental campaigners say the decision to put the boy on the prevent list is offensive reaction now live from Kevin Blow who's the coordinator for the pressure group network for police monitoring welcome to the program now the report says the boy was targeted after he signed an online petition and was on the outskirts of engaging in criminal behavior how concerned are you that environmental campaigners are being tied in with extremism at this point well I think your your viewers can understand why and she Franken campaigners were absolutely livid yesterday when they discovered the the case study in this report the fact that that they've been accused of grooming a young person who was simply involved in in political campaigning and at the end of the day thanks largely to the to the condemnation that came from ourselves and from the Green Party's sir Pia Baroness Johnny Jones the the the people responsible for that report were forced to to clarify that the the claims are they were that were may were entirely false that that person hadn't been involved in the anti-fracking movement but I think one of the concerns about the response subsequent to that and the clarification that was issued is I think it probably raises more questions than answers we don't know for instance why it is that the that the answer fracking was picked out as an example of alleged extremism or where that idea came from we have no idea what extremists environmental the bar area whereby mentalism means and there's no definition of that in the report and this comes back so a problem that there's been again and again with the involvement of counterterrorism officers in this type of surveillance and and and responses to people involved in in legitimate political dissent the domestic extremism that they label that they use has no meaning in law it means pretty much whatever the policeman is Amin now do you think that the police and his parents were right in the end to be concerned about unknown people on the internet encouraging him into activism it's a fourteen year old boy it's very hard to say from the details that are available in that report but what the suggestion seems to be is that he was involved in going to protests handing out leaflets these are the nuts and bolts of being involved in any form of basic local but campaigning around any issue the report approval he's proving lee says that the the response of the police which was to issue an abduction notice to the people that he was talking to was somehow something that should be taken up again in the future in circumstances where as far as we can make out no crime was ever committed and this is the problem this is the problem that having gone down the route of labeling a particular set of campaigners rightly or wrongly but almost certainly with no particular legal basis as extremists the police then massively over ends to a perceived threat in what is let's face it supposedly a program that is voluntary and intended to to prevent people from being becoming involved in terrorism this is what I'm gonna do with terrorism and we don't think the counterterrorism police should have anything to do with interfering and disrupting the legitimate campaigns well exactly and of course we've mentioned that the police later dismissed the suggestion that he was involved in the anti-fracking movement but what message do you think this sends to people who want to campaign over legitimate environmental concern well it's the it's the latest in a series of revelations about the involvement of counterterrorism police targeting environmental campaigners imper take Yelina target e in the anti-fracking movement which has been entirely peaceful and which they should have no involvement in in the surveillance and and and the targeting of we say that we do want to see an end to the to the smearing of campaigners as domestic extremists there's no basis for it we want to see the complete removal of counterterrorism police from any involvement in anything to do with public order placing those things are fundamental to changing making sure this type of situation doesn't arise again Kevin blow from the network for police monitoring pressure group thank you so much for your time you
