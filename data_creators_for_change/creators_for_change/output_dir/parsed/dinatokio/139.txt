hi guys okay it's like half eight in the
evening I've just removed my makeup with
like a few baby wipes and then I was
rummaging through my cupboards for some
kind of face masks that I haven't tried
and then I came across this one that I
ordered actually off Amazon about three
weeks ago and it's one of those weird
things that you see on Amazon I thought
I would try this one and I try it on
camera with you guys looks like a piece
of and that's because it literally
is in a bottle it is bird or
gliese ooh no fun illuminating mask I'm
looking to open it up literally oh my
God look how terrible the packaging of
the instructions is just like a piece of
paper with it you'll handle a Japanese
nightingale droppings is that a
nightingale birds then greasy this is
bird going on my face for the sake
of good skin
thanks for the spoon on the back it says
Made in Japan and it's got a bunch of
like Japanese writing and you can go
your movements on the website which is a
greasy Lube calm literally Pooh agree
seppuku
it's a puma like I'm gonna put poo on my
face you know when you walk around
outside you go to the shops and like
there's loads of pigeons and seagulls
and you're trying hard to dodge the bird
 landing on your head I'm doing the
office I could potentially just walk
down to trial square and go for free but
that's just the pigeon so that's kind of
like buying the Poundland one and this
is like getting there from Harrods you
can use it in two ways as a face wash or
as a mass so it's manufactured by Iguazu
poo incorporated Japan produced using
free-range Japanese Nightingale in Mount
