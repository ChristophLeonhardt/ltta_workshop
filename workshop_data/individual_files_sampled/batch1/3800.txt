it's disturbing to me to think that those individuals might be harassed there will be no harassment as a part how can you tell me that as it how can you do you watch Twitter why would i order them to make available to you information about people who work at polls but it's not already a public requirement to do so so that those people can be harassed for doing their civic duty we're asking you to preserve evidence in case it's necessary that's it bottom line you specifically asked to reserve they pull data and that is offensive to me because it seems to go against the very principle that a vote is secret okay well specifically let's review it the ballots and voting machines from the following early voting polling places shall be set aside sequestered and impounded cardenas smoke I mean are they not to be counted and we're not saying I am NOT ordering him to preserve anything I'm going to deny this as a writ of prohibition or remand Amos I think there's been a failure to exhaust administrative remedies because the Secretary of State is the one who would tell us if in fact she needs this information or her inquiry she would do that through her procedures not through the course
