This is Mom's video diary.
Hey, man.
It's too dirty.
Say Tuesday, June 22, 2010.
Hi.
This is -- do I
say "this is who"?
You can do whatever you want.
This is Pam White.
Should I start?
Yeah, whenever you want.
O.K. Hello.
I am Pam White.
I am a mother of three children.
I will tell you a
little bit about me.
I grew up in a hotel.
My father owned the hotel.
And it was an unusual
way to grow up,
but it was a lovely
way to grow up.
I was an actress.
I did modeling.
I live for my family
and my children.
And one little glitch is that
I have developed Alzheimer's.
And initially, I was quite
distressed and upset about it.
But it doesn't really matter.
It doesn't really
change anything.
So I don't feel sad,
and I don't feel regret.
I feel blessed that I have this
wonderful family, and a husband
who is extraordinarily
wonderful.
Good morning.
Hi.
Can I get you up?
Why?
Because I'm sure you'd
like to have breakfast.
Be right there.
Can you tell me the story
of when you proposed to Mom?
My senior year in college,
the Vietnam War was raging.
A lottery was done, and
draft numbers were drawn.
My number was 16, which meant
it was 100 percent sure that I
would have been drafted.
My great-grandfather, my
grandfather, my father
were all in the
United States Navy.
So I applied to
naval officer school.
All the while, I
had been planning
on asking your mom to marry me.
She is capable of doing less
and less around the house.
I probably talked to a woman
from the Alzheimer's Society
two, maybe three times.
They think it's important
I should somehow
remain more of a husband by
having a caregiver get her
up in the morning,
get her dressed,
bathe her, give her
medicine, make her meals.
Maybe.
So far, so good.
I don't mind doing it.
I like being with her.
Do you think that you
getting more confused
has been hard for Dad?
I don't think he
thinks I'm confused.
In that way.
Hmm?
I said I don't think he feels
that he is, or feels that I am.
Confused.
I'm not confused.
You think I'm confused?
No, maybe that's a bad word.
But you need help
with things that you
didn't used to need help with.
Right.
Yeah.
Do you think that's
hard for him?
Did you notice a change
with Mom from the last trip?
No, the change in the
year has been profound.
Watching the person
that you love
so much, who has been so much
a part of your life, you know.
It's nice she smiles
when she sees me.
Thank God for her smile.
That's huge.
But there's a lot more that, you
know, I used to get from her,
that she would do
for me, that's gone.
My nickname is Fast
Eddie, and it's
because I tend to just get
things done in a hurry.
And Pam's favorite
question is, where's Ed?
And I can answer
it 100 times a day.
Just getting her
out of the house
and into the car to go
shopping is a big deal.
And her walk is now a
shuffle, not a walk.
So it's just slow, slow, slow.
And don't ever let her
know that you're impatient,
which I'm sure there
are several times a week
when she knows that
I'm impatient with her.
And she knows it.
You can -- you
know she knows it.
And of course, I feel
terrible when it happens.
Yeah.
Sometimes, if I'm the first
thing she sees in the morning,
I don't actually think
she recognizes me.
That's beginning.
What must it be like?
How much does Pam know
about what's happened,
what's happening and
what will happen to her?
Every time I see her,
I hope I hug her.
Every time I see her,
I tell her I love her.
I tell her how
magnificent her smile is.
I tell her what a great
life we've had together.
And I thank her for
what she's done for me.
She was an incredibly
attentive, loving mother.
I know she'd love
to be that person.
I know that.
I have made a commitment
to this beautiful woman
that I will live
with her forever.
So whatever happens, we're
definitely doing it together.
