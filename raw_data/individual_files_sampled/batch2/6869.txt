in the last 24 hours or so Donald Trump has said a number of maniacal things so we decided that it would be fun to do a poll what is the dumbest thing that Donald Trump has said in the last day now it is a significant competition he was down and near the border in California and he was talking about Mexicans who could climb the wall and this is what he said he said getting over the top is easy these are like professional mountain climbers they're incredible climbers they can't climb some of these walls some of them they can those are the walls were not using so now not only are Mexicans coming over country criminals and rapists but there are also professional mountain climbers so I don't know if they're doing the criminal activity before after presumably after they've climbed the mountains to get in and then they have added us and I presume some of them are not good mountain climbers no but but most of them are ok I this is like Steve King when he talked about how there's the drug Mexican drug dealers with the cantaloupe cabs because they dragging 60 pounds of drugs across the border you remember or however much I think Trump said this they're gonna throw the 60 pounds of drugs over the wall which is a different Olympic sport that's right and I should really form a team man they'd be a medicine right so that's contestant number one contestant number two is he also said talking about our space program Oh buckle up you know I was saying it the other day because we're doing a tremendous amount of work in space I said maybe we need a new force we'll call it the space force and I was not really serious and then I said what a great idea maybe we'll have to do that that could happen so I wasn't serious that I really was yeah cuz I think a space force would be great I hear that he is already actually considered nominating commander Darth Vader as the leader of the space force and and and the he thinks that maybe they could build a whole star like like maybe a Death Star for their sales I keep wanting to call it a sales force space force Hey all right and now finally contestant number three this is all within 24 hours okay he went was talking about troops when he was in California and he put out this tweet it was my great honor to deliver a message to the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to our great US military straight from the heart of the American people we support you thank you love you etc did you see there how he spelled Marine Corps I was really hoping this would be one of the three ah cor II know that's not how Marine Corps spelled this cor P okay he's been president for over a year I mean let alone the fact that he's old he's been present for more than a year and he doesn't know how it's spelled so many Marines has he been around over the past year Tammy Duckworth senator Democratic senator who's a veteran calls him cadet bone spurs because of bone spurs he said he couldn't make it to vietnam they said which foot he said I don't know maybe both excuse was made up bad but he's he's a big supporter of the Marine Corps they got a good core that they work out it on Crunchy's everyday miles okay so imagine if a Democratic president had misspelled Marine Corps they would never stop the troops they're so against the troops the best thing about social media the best thing this is gonna make me look really petty is that people have to write things down when you just say things you could hide a lot of ignorance but when you have to write it down it becomes clear and that hits Donald Trump every once in a while yes so which brings us to our poll TYT Network comm slice dumbass to vote what what's the dumbest thing Trump has said in the last 24 hours a Mexican mountain climbers bSpace force C Marine Corps I actually think that space force is like the third party candidate there it's gonna be spoiler for one of the two because space horse actually looks it's not his idea I mean there is sort of a space force now and people talked about it nobody wants use it for the military you see well we have international trees against weaponization of outer space and everything but you he knows that his idea right so I am between Marine Corps and Mexican mountain climbers I predicted dead heat but but that's why we do the polls because I want to know so vote on what was the dumbest statement by Donald Trump in the last 24 hours at tea white tea network.com slash dumbass if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now TYT Network comm /join get the whole younger so every day
