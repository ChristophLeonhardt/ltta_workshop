I think one tonight Donald Trump is a notorious climate change denier even going so far as to call it a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese but he actually doesn't parrot his party's go-to line you know the one I don't know behind climate change I'm not a scientist I'm not a scientist I'm not a scientist and I've got the grades to prove it no Trump is a scientist well he's got an uncle who's a scientist the president was asked about climate change yesterday by The Associated Press and said and I quote here my uncle was a great professor at MIT for many years dr. John Trump and I didn't talk to him about this particular subject but I have a natural instinct for science and I will say that you have scientists on both sides of the picture so he didn't talk to his uncle about climate change but he knows what scientists think because he has a natural instinct for science because uncle John who worked in MIT if that makes no sense to you Trump will explain further at length and that's thing too in 60 seconds say what you want about Donald J Trump but there is one thing that is not open for debate and that is whether or not he is a very smart person my uncle you know cuz I do believe in the racehorse theory right you know slow horses don't produce fast horses right I even had an uncle you'd have you believe in genes some do some don't my uncle was a great professor but my uncle was a professor for years I even talked about my uncle was a professor at MIT uncle was one of the top people that MIT but I'm smarter than him I'm smarter than anybody I come from a very small family it's a smart family and you don't like we're smart I had an uncle who was a great professor for I believe 40 years at MIT and I used to discuss nuclear with him all the time I understand nuclear look up dr.
