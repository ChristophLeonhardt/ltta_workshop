groundhog Kayne has seen red pill black Candace Owens shadow which means we can expect six more years of Trump political pundits in the mainstream media can discern the face of the sky but they cannot discern the signs of the times we will discuss why with Selina Zito author of the new book the great revolt inside the populist coalition reshaping American politics then we'll discuss what Kanye West Shania Twain and Coachella can tell us about 2018 and 2020 I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show the Blue Wave is coming right it's inevitable the Blue Wave is gonna come Trump is toast because of Russian porn star former FBI directors it's all over stick a fork in them right not quite Shania Twain Kanye West mm have me more hopeful than ever for Trump 2020 and it's not just because I'm coming down off all my drugs from Coachella even Coachella has me happy about Republican prospects in 2018 and 2020 because they speak to the common sense of Americans not precisely ideological rigor not even an ideological shift but a demographic and a dispositional shift I think in politics I'll explain more on that in a bit first to lay the groundwork of why I'm excited politically let's bring on Selina Zito to discuss the populist movement that swept Donald Trump into office and whether it can outlast president Co FFA Selina Zito is a national political reporter and columnist at the Washington Examiner and the New York Post and a CNN contributor and she's the author of this excellent book let's bring on Selina Selina thank you for being here so the book is the great revolt inside the populist coalition reshaping American politics you have managed to get this book blurb by Senator Tom cotton Rush Limbaugh and Jake Tapper which is a pretty broad swath of the political spectrum you call 2016 the great revolt and you find the populist to the ones reshaping American politics what are your main findings from your research well what I found through my research first of all is something that I noticed leading up to 2016 that this technological industrial revolution going on in this country is impacted everyone in concluding our politics and we have found our way not to just express ourselves through politics but have a shock how by what brand loyalty we have to to to institutional brands that have had us forever like sort of everything changed and when that all changed it impacted politics I don't think people were paying attention to that and and so after the election there was this rush to see what kept Trump's motors change their mind will they change their mind and you see sort of reporters parachuting in for a day asking you know did you change your mind what do you think of this tweet and they aren't sort of digging in and understanding what has unsettled the electorate in the way that it has well you know they parachute in and they paint this picture of the Trump voter as this uneducated rube who probably has some fairly significant racial animus and he's just a loser basically that's just their basil white loser in the middle of America and you describe a variety of characters character types who voted for Trump and I gotta tell you I know people from these areas I have family in these areas some of whom voted for Trump and so I knew immediately that the picture that was being painted by the mainstream media isn't right what are the the character types that you found of people who voted for Trump well there's I went to all the counties in the Great Lakes Midwest the the states that changed the election Pennsylvania Ohio Wisconsin Michigan Iowa and I went to only the counties that voted Obama Obama Trump because I felt it was most important to look at those counties because they're the ones that that show the shift they're the ones that show the great flip and I removed counties that didn't that voted Republican in 2014 so say you voted for Joni Ernst in Iowa 2014 that County was taken out because I wanted to see the purest flip minute you reviewed hundreds and hundreds of people and along with Brad Todd we took a look at these voters and we started to see a pattern about seven different archetypes of voters that were largely missed in the election and who are making up this new coalition and it's a coalition that actually has its roots in 2006 when the Republicans first lost the house and they lost Gemma conservative Democrat voters and they lost independent voters because they were unhappy with the status quo so this is like a wrecking ball to all establishment Republican or Democrat and and these voters more than often than not are highly you know have a college degree have a successful life some of them haven't had ups and downs women with guns that's like one of my favorite chapters girl gun power because they went completely undetected in suburban women who believe that the Second Amendment is the most feminist thing they can do because it completely empowers them they have total control of their life in their destiny and nothing like that one that absolutely on the feminist gun power I do love that you know women are not as strong as men that's just a fact of life it is a biological fact and so the only thing that can be an equalizer the only thing it actually can bring sexual equality as a matter of fighting off aggressors is a gun and the Democrats have just totally gone off the rails on that issue well it's really interesting I teach this class at Harvard where I take the students out of Cambridge and place them in different parts of the country and immerse them and and and have them approach reporting the way I do know interstates know airplanes nothing but back roads live in a bed-and-breakfast so the first person you meet is a small business person and I took them out to a gun range and the first group of people that they met there were a group of about 40 women urban women between the ages of 20 and 45 and they just sort of validated the entire chapter you know I think a lot of people they they think that the reason people voted for Trump is that his personality they were out for blood they were angry they liked his bad language they liked his rudeness and yet the what I noticed in your book so many of the people profiled say I like Trump I still stick with Trump I just wish he wouldn't tweet you know I really wish you would Ben and I've heard this from friends of mine and relatives of mine one what does that tell us about the people who were supporting him these these forgotten Americans and - in your opinion observing politics or the tweets good or bad for Donald Trump it doesn't seem to hurt him I know as you said a lot of the people that I interviewed to run this policy and love his sort of approach to Washington wish he wouldn't tweet all the time but even that I think he's really toned down in the past few months but but also they weren't looking for someone to like you know they liked Barack Obama they were proud of Barack Obama why did these the people in this new Trump coalition did but they didn't like his policies and that's the flip side of this that man that's why Democrats lost the midterms was because they they were punished for Obama's policies but Obama was still dislikable character whereas Donald Trump they don't care if they do or do not like him they care if he gets the job done and and that is the most important thing to them and then the other thing is what you said about angry it's one of the things that really I think it's under my skin because a lot of pundits miss and reporters as well miss - what make America great again meant they thought that was angry they thought it was a dog whistle they still do they thought something that was you know looking backwards it's not it's aspirational Americans want to be part of something bigger than themselves and they haven't felt that for an incredibly long time and that's what make America great again was about totally right I love in the book how you point out everyone thinks these people are desperate and they're bitter players or whatever but they're not they're actually hopeful they're optimistic you called it during 2016 in September you wrote in the Atlantic I believe that the press takes trump literally but not seriously his supporters take him seriously but not literally and when I read that I thought yes that's exactly as a New Yorker who knows how New Yorkers talk that is how I feel about him what is the difference well you know this is one of the types of Trump voter you I do but when they hear him talk do it yeah I could have seen me saying something like that you know I mean they get it well and even the people that don't like the way he talks would still love his policies understand that people in business do talk like that but people in business do do fake outs to to get what they want they a lot of people have in their family they think business is for friends they get his personality sometimes it you know grates on their nerves but it doesn't detach them from him because you know here's the thing Donald Trump was not the cause of this movement here's the result of it and the important thing to take from the book is this movement if the movements up here the peace we're still about here we haven't we haven't even gotten to the top yet this is still going to impact politics business culture entertainment sports it's across the board in our lives I think it's what Kanye West is referring to as the shifting consciousness if you've been watching is highly entertaining tweets the last few days I reach we did humbly west three times the past 24 hours and I've never even followed him but he did it there was several his tweets were very aspirational and that's what people that's what people miss like reporters and pundits tend to think anger anger anger it's not people want to be taken to a better place people want to be part of something bigger than themselves we or historically that is who we've been it is in our DNA and people miss that oh that's right and we've already talked about the girl gun power that one of the most perplexing I think groups that you identify in the book and even for me I've had to wonder how it worked out for Trump or the suburban moms the late great Barbara Bush said in 2016 that she couldn't understand why any woman would vote for Trump he was so boorish about women and you say that the silent suburban moms constituted a crucial part of his coalition why did they vote for him and why were they so important was interesting how much they've been insulted by five Hillary Clinton yeah you know it it really is disturbing I think look these women are looking for a strength in leadership but they're also looking for a wrecking ball because they do not believe that Washington and either party have served their families and their communities well it's not just personal it's not just about them you know a lot of these suburban women have lived in the same area all their lives their mug their mother's mother's mother have lived there right and they have seen sort of how the family has prospered and gotten better each time and they don't they didn't see that under the last to admit maybe the last three administrations and that they saw that with Trump they believed that there was hope in in his way of doing business to - atchoo maybe make their communities and their areas of the prosperous again a very good point and it is there you know Hillary Clinton said she made fun of the mothers who baked cookies and things like that in the 1990s so I guess that one could explain it one aspect that surprised me a little and actually changed my analysis of the election is the education we all know that president Coffey loves the uneducated was a phrase that he used in his speech you write Americans who live their lives among a group of friends and neighbors with varied educational backgrounds preferred Trump more than Clinton or Romney while college-educated Americans who live exclusively among other degree holders were less likely to support Trump even if they were Republican so it's not the education itself that is the practicum support it's your the education of your friends and the people you live with how does that work what does that say about just the geography of America the the social breakdown I suppose of America super zip codes so think about the six counties that surround Washington DC by the counties that in New York and Connecticut that surround New York City or around Los Angeles in those areas and this is like you know Virginia Maryland parts of Virginia parts of Maryland in those suburban zip codes if you had and just say you had a graduate degree you didn't vote for Trump because everyone around you was doing well but in looking districts around in Kenosha Wisconsin or in suburban Pittsburgh or suburban Philadelphia in these areas I would actually should say it's urban Philadelphia these areas have a mix of college education blue-collar worker technical workers these are people who interact and happen and and and as part of their daily life or their family life to interact with people with a variety of diverse amount of education and and so they were much more apt to support Trump because they have seen the carnage you know he got many fun ever saying that word go to Youngstown Ohio and see carnage you know go to a lot of these places in the country and you see carnage and so they have seen the impact of some of these economic policies and so they both they were persuaded to go vote for Trump over Clinton because they felt that he was more in touch with what would make their community better these people are not as not that selfish right they want their their whole community is their identity it's an extension of their family it's something they're very proud to be from and when they see parts of it crumble they want someone who's gonna make everyone better not just know the nice street that they live on that's right yeah that reminds me of how the left loves humanity but they don't really like humans very much and so you see those those lecturing us on who we have to vote for and who has compassion for the poor or the uneducated or this that whatever terms they use they tend only to ever go to cocktail parties with their fellow Harvard alumni and they don't actually speak to any of these people and they break out in hives when they get more than 150 miles outside the city now all of this makes a good case for a movement a vaguely populist not terribly ideological movement of people who have been the victims of certain neglect economic neglect drug epidemics political neglect now Trump's pitch when he ran was largely about management you point this out he says we have terrible deals I'm gonna make good deals I'm we're gonna win when I do it it's all about sort of my expertise in running things we have stupid people I'm gonna be a smart person it wasn't about ideology was a very unequal candidate yeah so once Trump is done after his third or fourth term I don't know whenever you know whenever we've got to say goodbye to him how does that movement continue if it's about instead of about ideas well it's I I don't think it is about a man I actually think it's about that people that are part of the coalition so as I said he was the he was not the cause of it but he was a result of it I think our poet you know everybody so many years I typically a hundred our Teutonic plates rely and and and our electorate makes different choices than that pass behavior and I think we're in the middle of that smoothness and and this is a book that's across the ideological spectrum I think it's important to read because if we don't understand what's going on in this country we are going to continue to have disruptive forces in in Washington and and while that is important at the top level at the bottom level like in Congress that can sometimes be really unstable because nothing really gets done so but you know I mean the Democrats are going through their own you know their own populist upheaval we don't talk about it much because they're not the party in power but but there is there's this very fractured and that's their challenge a one little extra bit about this coalition because they have as you say they have different goals there they come from different places I want to talk about the Christians evangelical Christians in particular but Christians broadly who support Donald Trump get a lot of flack for it people say that they're hypocrites people say that they're associating with a morally corrupt guy you call them the King Cyrus Christians are Christians who voted for Trump hypocrites no they would be very when they are very offended when they hear that first of all I am doing is first of all about forgiveness very important aspect that people tend to forget when they talk about Christians second of all the these voters who were the last ones to go across the line for Trump cuz they love them Kings the King Cyrus because King Cyrus was the Persian I mean not getting this totally correct but he was the Persian king who led the who protected the Israelites and even though they had no ideological and religiosity nection because he was going to protect them keep they followed him and this is this is sort of what evangelical saw in Trump he was going to protect their values it's been a long time since someone stood up for them including george w bush and and and he which is interesting because he's a Christian and I don't know what Trump is but he had the prettiest thing all wrong yeah he like he likes the 2corinthians here but you do put in the book you talk about the various times you sort of tried to bumble out an explanation of his Christian faith and he you know one time he said he was asked do you ever ask for forgiveness and he said yeah you know I try not to make mistakes so that I don't have to ask forgiveness it's very it was very funny to watch each time but no one's had their back so they didn't go for the Christian guy this time or woman and and and Hillary Clinton is a devout Methodist I interviewed her about about her religion and and its impact in her life but you know they went for the person who would have their back and one of the most important things and having their back was what the makeup of the Supreme Court look like yeah and he has paid them back in space I mean of all of the members of the all the different parts of his coalition the evangelicals have received back the most for their investment in there folks I must say when I read that chapter when the whole book is illuminating when I read that chapter in particular as a Christian who supports Donald Trump I thought oh yes she gets it she actually understand that this group of people I I knew they existed because I'm one of them but it's yeah it's a finally a fair dealing for Christians who support Trump my last question I have to ask you you're a senior political analyst you've worked in these things a lot what does this mean for 2018 and 2020 if you're willing to venture any predictions well I'm one of the few people to have that I'm hesitant to say this blue wave is going to take over because I don't have an understanding of what the primary outcome is going to be for Democrats there's also you know Republicans and independents tend to come home and come home late in midterm elections they just show up in terms of Donald Trump and you know I'd say in the book this Coalition is a wrecking ball and they want to disrupt things you know part of that's going to be disrupting some establishment Republicans you know they've been unsatisfied with them yeah in particular on some issues like health care and entree so you know I'm not I'm not ready yet I would probably say ask me again but the Trump coalition hasn't changed it's still intact and I find evidence as that out on the road which is all the time of gathering more as opposed to shedding I'm so glad to hear you say that because I think that I'm a crazy person when I have the same thoughts I say historically speaking I guess Democrats should take the house that's sort of how I get you know and and yet I'm reluctant to predict it it does not seem quite right to me and you point out in the book I think it's something like 18% of Trump voters or are nervous about telling people that they're true voters and among certain demographics that number shoots up to 40% or you know pretty significant chunks do you think I know I said the last one was the last question but really this is the last question do you do you think that that social anxiety that we have to keep quiet that we can't tell anybody that we're voting for Trump do you think that that produces skewed public opinion polls and therefore we can just as happened in 2016 when Princeton said two nights before the election 99% chance Hillary Clinton's going to win and then that didn't quite happen do you think that we can trust these polls going into 2018 or are these silent voters going to come up and give us a surprise the appalling has been difficult period since the advent of people just you know so they polling is much more challenging so there's that but also yes I mean I I have done stories lately where people will not I mean they'll give me my their name but they won't want their name to be punished I mean published because I'm therefore punished right and then yeah I mean you know and these are businessmen and women who are very supportive of the president but they're like I you know I'm a business I don't need that aggravation look what they do to people or you know I have to work with clients or I don't want to be you know outed on social media and and so there's I don't think I actually think that number has grown since then probably is even higher to people who since 2016 I tend to agree and I have to say your writing is always on point if you don't if you don't follow Selina Selina Zito is one of the few people in the national media who actually seems to get it and is not in a just an echo chamber and the book is a fascinating read the book is the great revolt inside the populist coalition shaping American politics you've got to go get it it is the best book I have read about the 2016 election with one exception Hillary Clinton's what happened because it answers the question right on the cover Hillary Clinton with that exception the cover itself gives a good view this is the the most insightful book I've read about it Selina thank you so much for being here all right do I have to say goodbye to Facebook in YouTube now that is a terrible shame because this is Groundhog yay we're gonna talk about how a Kanye West and Shania Twain and Coachella and the Eminem are all giving us good hope for the future for Donald Trump's presidency for the policies he's trying to enact and for the voters that he talked to that other politicians haven't talked to it is Groundhog yay stick around but you can only do that at daily wired.com if you're already there thank you very much you help keep the lights on and the lights today you know they're a little different it looks like my eyes are even more dilated from all the peyote I did at Coachella Coachella over the weekend but it really helps us out and you ain't not what do you get it's ten bucks a month or 100 dollars for an annual membership you get me you get the intro Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get to ask questions in the mailbag and I think I'm coming up next this coming month I will be doing the conversation so you can ask questions everybody can watch but only subscribers get to ask the questions many are called but few were chosen none of that matters what really matters is the leftist here's tumblr because guys today was a big day for leftist years tumblr like if you don't have it already run just run it's too late it's a too late to get if you do have a tumblr get ready because Kanye West the pop-culture figure is just tweeting out these extremely conservative sentiments beginning with how much he likes red pill black Candace Owens who's a friend of the show she's come on here before so you're gonna need this because they're gonna you know all this pop culture you be like oh yes oh what and then the floodgates are going to explode make sure you have your leftist here's tumblr because if you don't have it then you're going to drown and die I go to daily wire.com be we'll be right back they are really good today they are really scrumptious and delicious and this is because I'm coming back from Coachella drew made me for the Andrew Clavin show watch Coachella and report on what's what's happening what it means for the culture and I was pleasantly surprised I was really surprised because this if if you missed it which I assume probably you did this is what mmm this is how he began one of his songs at Coachella how many people are proud to be citizens of this beauty beautiful country of ours if you couldn't see there were huge American flags on the screens and it wasn't ironic you know he went into some song we're singing about himself but it wasn't like an ironic thing you know I hate this country it's really a terrible country he actually meant that he said it's good I have to clean up his language but he said it's good to be back from overseas it's nice to be back here in America and this is a big turnaround because for the last few months Eminem has been trying desperately to get Donald Trump's attention even though Trump just won't do it he's not giving him his attention but this is what he was rapping just a few months ago that's an awfully hot coffee pot should I drop it on Donald Trump probably not but that's all I got till I come up with a solid got a plan an L I got a hatchet like a damn Apache would a tomahawk imma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan and say a prayer that every time talks she gets a mouth ah i'ma stop but we better give Obama props cuz what we got in office now's a kamikaze that'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust and while the drama pops and he waits for the quiet down he'll just gas is clean up and fly around to the bombing stops it so it goes on like that this was Eminem a few months ago I I don't listen to rap ever I just don't like it is that good rap though that doesn't sound like good rap I'd listen to the Sugar Hill Gang over there that was just terrible the rhymes were forced and weird and really sad but anyway now he's not angry now he's grateful and he loves America he's talking about how great it is this was at Coachella and Coachella you'd expect it to be super political Beyonce was the big headliner and the songs weren't good and she's a very political person but even she didn't get really political there I found out apparently the guy who owns Coachella is a Christian a billionaire a conservative Christian billionaire and maybe that reined it in a little bit but what I think actually rained it in is that entertainers and people in the pop culture are realizing this doesn't play this doesn't play in some of them I think are having epiphanies themselves you know for instance Kanye we knew that Kanye kind of like Donald Trump because during the campaign or maybe right after the election he went and visited him at Trump Tower he actually showed up you know and took pictures with him so he wasn't always a Democrat but he said left-wing things Kanye West just started tweeting out these amazing tweets over the weekend he goes I love the way Candace Owens thinks and you know Candace from the show she's been on here before she's red pill black and she's used to be a lefty and now she's a conservative and she speaks directly to black people in particular and so kanye west tweets that out he then tweets be fearless express what you feel not what you've been programmed to think he says the blinders are off he says this psychological zombie effect you didn't say anything a BAE just said that phrase but okay I kind of see what he's going to he goes we have freedom of speech but not freedom of thought absolutely right and sometimes we don't even have freedom of speech he goes on the thought police want to suppress freedom of thought that is the definition of political correctness that is the project of the modern left he then goes on and says constantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck there so he's actually pivoting points but to another correct one and a conservative talking point and then he says there was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us but now it's a mentality there's this slave mentality slavish nough says self victimization is a disease absolutely right then he goes on a string he just starts tweeting scott adams videos scott adams as the Dilbert guy who rightly predicted Donald Trump winning the presidency and has been a really good observer of the Trump effect and why people like him and why people vote for him now Kanye West is pushing this out here now I know Ben said I think he said on the show today wrote a piece about this they said conservatives shouldn't be thrilled about the we shouldn't embrace Kanye West Kanye says a lot of crazy things and he takes prizes away from Taylor Swift and he said George Bush doesn't care about black people and so we shouldn't suddenly embrace him because he's saying the correct things but I don't agree with that at all I think absolutely we should I'm not saying that Kanye West is now the great intellectual leader of the conservative movement or he's some political philosopher or some luminary but it is so important that guys like Kanye West say the sort of things that we believe and sometimes come over to our side or support the causes that we support that is so important conservatives have seeded the popular culture for so long and it's why the left was dominant for decades upon decades and now we're playing into the popular culture politics is downstream of culture that's what Andrew Breitbart always used to say Donald Trump is a cultural figure we elected him as a to fight a cultural battle because all battles ultimately our cultural battles even over taxes even the question of how much we should lower taxes is cultural it's about what our relationship to the government our relationship to money what we think of when we think of private property in the United States and how individuals should react to their property I love that Kanye is doing this I think he is freeing people from certain social stigmas they might have about politics you know when I talked to Selena she said that education wasn't the predictor of voting for Trump or not voting for Trump it was the education of the people around you it's this social pressure to conform so if you're constantly being bombarded with people saying it's totally unacceptable to support Donald Trump UK it's totally unacceptable to be a conservative you're more likely to comply that's the left-wing agenda that's their goal but if you have people breaking that up and guys like Kanye West saying like now I I don't really like Hillary I'd vote for Trump or Roseanne Barr another person who's not a conservative but says yeah I like Trump I like what's happening I don't want to vote for Democrats that is wonderful that cracks through this oppressive culture you know Shania Twain the Canadian singer said last week that she would she couldn't vote obviously in the election but she would have voted for Trump the apparatus of the mainstream media in the entertainment industry descended upon her like vultures like monsters picking apart her flesh and she had to apologize and it was a little bizarre because she clearly stated her opinion then she said basically I'm sorry for stating my opinion next time I'll keep my opinion to myself but they descend on you so you can't say that shut your mouth you can't say that you can't say that and that this is a wonderful sign for Republicans and for the Trump people because as long as they are pressuring you and saying if you believe a certain thing you're gonna lose your job if you state common sense you're gonna lose your job at Google like James d'amour or if you hold a political view that was the main consensus political view until five minutes ago and like Brandon Ike on the issue of gay marriage you're gonna lose your company you're gonna lose Mozilla we're gonna take everything from you they incentivize people shutting up and what that means is they're gonna be less honest with pollsters they're gonna be the let they're not gonna be willing to say I'd vote for Trump because you could lose your job you could lose your reputation but they're still gonna go vote for Donald Trump there's two because they want to crack that culture that's a wonderful thing this is a groundhog yay is really what I think about it I think this is a wonderful sign for 2018 and 2020 by all rights there should be a blue wave by all rights the Democrats should retake the house and yet this culture is so poisonous people are being so censored and silenced to say why I actually kind of like the president he's doing a good job I don't know if you noticed it appears he's bringing peace to Korea after 70 years and is denuclearizing the craziest state on planet earth if they even say that they could lose their reputations and so they're gonna keep quiet and that silent majority is just gonna keep on going right to the voting booths wonderful stuff and I think the first time I've ever said something nice about Kanye that's not true I actually think Kanye West has great taste in music he just I don't know that what he does with the music is great himself but he clearly has a good ear you know and takes good songs and does whatever he does to them and now he's he's doing that to a political speech and to political philosophy and fine by me keep doing it man I'm almost a Kanye West fan all right come back tomorrow we have a lot of cool guests coming up but I can't tell you I'm gonna keep it a secret I'm gonna keep I'm just like the silent majority I'm the silent Michael the silent me okay come back tomorrow I'm
