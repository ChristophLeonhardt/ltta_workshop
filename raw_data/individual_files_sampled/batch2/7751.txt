it's senior prank season and there is one kid in Missouri his name is Kyle skill he's a senior and he wanted to do something different according to him he said other people were gonna release live mice or you know building a beach in the front lobby area I and I thought let's do something more laid back so he posted this Craiglist ad to sell his school he thought this would be interesting so he put his school up for sale for twelve thousand two hundred and seventy five dollars and if you think that's pricey look at what you get you get a newly-built football field newly added for modern-day rooms a bunch of other perks and then the second to last one said reason for sale is due to loss of students coming up and that everything else is in good fun but the administration and the powers that be took issue with that they ended up suspending him because they thought that that implied the loss of students was due to an impending school shooting when he explains himself later he says it actually was because people are graduating of course but this is such a crazy story and I think a really funny prank that got a little too serious I know I felt like that was a bit harsh and the whole thing's harsh I mean oh the vacation is getting for being suspended yeah you probably live with that right but yeah on principle I hate the zero-tolerance policies they see out of an abundance of caution we're doing this right know out of an abundance of caution you talk to the kid and see if he's wearing a trench coat and his dad has a you know an ar-15 or something that's good caution that's a good car definitely talk to the kid find out why he said loss of students right but then once you find out that it was part of a prank and instead of real and he didn't release mice into the school yep you're like thank you didn't like hack into the principal's like the computer system and change grades he didn't you know you know him he didn't do anything was to print up fake report cards and sent him to the kids and it was like a football player who did it so it was like all the football players got straight A's and all the Nerds got like Aryan nerds like me we're getting beans you really want to make a statement about being afraid about what's going on in schools how about you make a an initiative to really look further into the mental well well-being of your students like don't use this kid as a scapegoat because the problem is a big problem this is he's not the problem that his spelling is the problem two easy ways for young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos
