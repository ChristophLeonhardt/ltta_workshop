1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,412
AND WE HAVE HUNDREDS THAT ARE

2
00:00:02,412 --> 00:00:07,817
READY TO G. BUT WHY I DO THAT

3
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:11,121
WHEN WE ARE TALKING SO NICELY.

4
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:14,090
PRETTY BRET IT IS ON IN

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,760
SINGAPORE ON JUNE 12TH AND A TOP

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,998
NORTH KOREAN LETTER THAT WAS

7
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:23,266
GIVEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.

8
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:25,735
AND WHERE DO WOO GO FROM HERE.

9
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,638
AND REAL CLEAR POLITICS AND

10
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:30,840
FOUNDER AND LESLIE MARSHAL AND

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,876
MOLLY HEMMINGWAY.

12
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:36,379
SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST.

13
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:39,015
TOM, SIGNIFICANT?

14
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:41,084
WE TALKED OF HOW THE TERMINOLOGY

15
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,520
IS SAYING AND IT MIGHT BE 1 OR 2

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,256
OR MIGHT BE A NUMBER OF SUMMITS.

17
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:48,191
>> WALKING BACK EXPECTATIONS

18
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:48,825
A LITTLE BIT.

19
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:52,329
BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE PRESIDENT

20
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,997
BELIEVES THAT DENUCLEARIZATION

21
00:00:53,997 --> 00:00:55,198
IS ON THE TABLE.

22
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:57,567
NOT SURE THAT IS WHERE THE NORTH

23
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:58,101
KOREANS ARE.

24
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,904
THE SUMMIT IS BACK ON TRACK AND

25
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:02,906
BY ALL ACCOUNTS GOING TO HAPPEN

26
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:04,808
IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AND WE

27
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:06,643
WERE TOLD THAT IT WOULD BE

28
00:01:06,643 --> 00:01:08,478
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN

29
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,380
AND YET HERE WE ARE.

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,681
>> I WAS WRONG.

31
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:14,117
LAST TIME I WAS ON YOUR SHOW.

32
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,318
>> Bret: I REMEMBER THAT.

33
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:17,220
>> WE WERE IN LOS ANGELES AND I

34
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,889
SAID IT WOULD BE ON BUT NOT ON

35
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:21,124
THE 12TH.

36
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:23,126
AND THEN AGAIN IT MAY NOT STILL.

37
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,595
I THINK THAT KIM JONG-UN AND THE

38
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:27,864
PRESIDENT, NORTH KOREA AND THE

39
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:29,332
UNITED STATES HAVE DIFFERENT

40
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:32,135
IDEAS OF WHAT DENUCLEARIZATION

41
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:34,137
IS GOING TO MEAN.

42
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:35,839
I DON'T THINK KIM JONG-UN WILL

43
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:38,842
BUDGE ON THE TROOPS IN SOUTH

44
00:01:38,842 --> 00:01:39,576
KOREA.

45
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,745
WE WILL NOT REMOVE THE TROOP AND

46
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:44,147
I DON'T THINK WE'LL GET THE DEAL

47
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:45,849
WE WANT AND WHY WE ARE HEARING

48
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:49,085
THE POSTURING FROM THE PRESIDENT

49
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:50,320
AND POMPEO.

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,789
IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME AND

51
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,591
WE'LL HAVE MORE THAN ONE

52
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,025
MEANING.

53
00:01:55,025 --> 00:02:00,463
I THINK THERE IS IT TWO

54
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:02,065
DIFFERENT DEFINITIONING.

55
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:05,602
>> I KNOW ABOUT SUMMIT AND WROTE

56
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:11,608
ABOUT REAGAN AND GORBACHEV.

57
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:14,944
IT SOMETIMES TAKES MORE THAN

58
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:15,245
ONE.

59
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:17,280
>> THERE WERE NO LINES OF

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,948
COMMUNICATION OPEN AND BACK

61
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:21,518
CHANNEL LINES WERE NOT OPEN.

62
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:23,820
AND HERE VISITING THE WHITE

63
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,989
HOUSE A TOP NORTH KOREAN

64
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,692
OFFICIAL A BAD GUY VISITING THE

65
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,494
WHITE HOUSE.

66
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:33,063
>> Bret: SPY CHIEF.

67
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:34,931
>> I THINK IT IS GOOD THAT

68
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:36,666
PEOPLE ARE RESETTING

69
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,168
EXPECTATIONS AND THE FACT THAT

70
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:40,437
PEOPLE ARE MEETING AND THAT IS

71
00:02:40,437 --> 00:02:41,538
SIGNIFICANT AND REMEMBER THAT

72
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:44,140
WHEN BARK BOOKKEEPER OBAMA WOULD

73
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,343
BE WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH BAD

74
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:50,547
GUYS, THOUGHT IT WAS A BAD IDEA.

75
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:52,849
THEY SAID I AM WILLING TO SIT

76
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:53,183
DOWN.

77
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:55,618
AND THIS IS SOMETIMES A GOOD

78
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:55,952
IDEA.

79
00:02:55,952 --> 00:02:57,720
WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE

80
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,523
EVIL PEOPLE, BUT TO GET THINGS

81
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:02,926
GOING AND SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT

82
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:03,660
IT.

83
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,395
>> Bret: PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON

84
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:08,598
CONSIDERED TO GO SIT DOWN WITH

85
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:13,236
KIM JONG-UN AND INSTEAD HAD

86
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:17,107
MADELINE ALBRIGHT,KIM JONNING-

87
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:17,407
IL.

88
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:18,975
THAT IS, THE FATHER.

89
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:20,910
AND THERE WAS ANOTHER MEETING

90
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,346
THAT CONCERNED THAT THE

91
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:24,180
PRESIDENT TODAY.

92
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,049
>> I DIDN'T LIKE THE RUSSIAN

93
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:27,550
MEETING AND I SAID WHAT IS THE

94
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,351
PURPOSE OF THAT.

95
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:30,587
BUT IT COULD BE A POSITIVE

96
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:31,020
MEETING.

97
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,755
IF IT IS A POSITIVE MEETING I

98
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,023
LOVE IT.

99
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:38,394
AND NEGATIVE MEETING I AM NOT

100
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:39,395
HAPPY.

101
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:42,165
>> Bret: HE CAN'T SAY HE'S NOT

102
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:42,599
TRANSPARENT.

103
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,534
HE DIDN'T LIKE THE RUSSIAN

104
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:46,536
MEETING BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT

105
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:47,370
IT WAS ABOUT.

106
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,172
>> TRUMP IS IT TRANSPARENT AND

107
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:52,108
HONEST AND TYPICALLY DIPLOMATIC

108
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:54,177
SPEAK IS MORE CAGEY AND HE'S

109
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:55,945
WILLING TO SAY.

110
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,381
HEY, WE MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT AND

111
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:00,917
WE'LL WAIT AND SEE AND IT IS

112
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:03,586
A GUY ON A HIGH WIRE WITHOUT

113
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:06,289
A NET WHICH IS A SPECTACLE TO

114
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,625
WATCH AND FRIGHTENING, WE'LL

115
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,826
SEE.

116
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:13,062
>> Bret: BUT THE RUSSIAN THING

117
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:15,598
UPSET SOME IN THE FOREIGN POLICY

118
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,935
REALM AND RUSSIA SAYING

119
00:04:19,935 --> 00:04:21,404
ESSENTIALLY REMEMBER US AND WHAT

120
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:23,273
ARE YOU DOING AND STICKING THEIR

121
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:24,607
NOSE IN IT?

122
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:27,277
>> NOT ONLY THAT RUSSIA IS

123
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:30,346
STICKING THEIR NOSE IN

124
00:04:30,346 --> 00:04:30,780
EVERYTHING.

125
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,849
ESPECIALLY WITH THE ELECTIONS.

126
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:35,051
AND WITH REGARD TO KIM JONG-UN.

127
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:38,922
MAYBE KIM JONG-UN AND THE NORTH

128
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:41,191
KOREANS DON'T HAVE THE, MAYBE WE

129
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:42,859
DON'T HAVE THE UPPER HAND WITH

130
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:45,128
THEM AS WE THINK AND WITH THAT

131
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:46,996
MEETING, THE PRESIDENT HAS TO

132
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:50,600
REMAIN ON HIS TOES MORE SO.

133
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,901
>> Bret: ONE LAST SOUND BITE

134
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:54,103
ABOUT THE TARIFFS AND THE

135
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:56,206
IMPLICATION OF THAT FROM THE

136
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:57,373
PRESIDENT'S POINT OF VIEW.

137
00:04:57,373 --> 00:04:59,809
>> ALL OF THE COUNTRY INCLUDING

138
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:01,311
THE EUROPEAN UNION.

139
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,246
THEY CHARGE TARIFFS.

140
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:04,814
WE DON'T ESSENTIALLY.

141
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:06,683
THEY CHARGE FIVE TIMES WHAT WE

142
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:07,951
CHARGE FOR TARIFFS.

143
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:10,687
I BELIEVE IN THE WORD RECIP

144
00:05:10,687 --> 00:05:11,754
PROICAL.

145
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:14,791
IF YOU CHARGE FIVE TIME WE'LL

146
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:15,525
CHARGE.

147
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:18,561
AND IN LIKE FREE-TRADE.

148
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:21,731
>> Bret: WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH

149
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:22,098
ALLIES.

150
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:25,335
YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY CUDDLY SAID

151
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:28,037
IT IS IT A FAMILY SQUABBLE AND

152
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:29,906
WE'LL KEEP THE LINES OF

153
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:31,274
COMMUNICATION OPEN AND SEE WHERE

154
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:32,275
IT GOES.

155
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,843
>> FREE-TRADE IS IT PREFERABLE

156
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:36,179
AND OUR ALLIES HAVE HAD GOOD

157
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:39,349
TRADE ARRANGEMENTES AND THAT WAS

158
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:41,017
FOREIGN POLICYERANCY AS WE TRIED

159
00:05:41,017 --> 00:05:42,919
TO HELP STRENGTHEN THEM IN THE

160
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,455
LONG COLD WAR, BUT THEY CHARGE

161
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:48,324
HIGHER TARIFFS THAN WE DO AND

162
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:50,059
NOT NECESSARILY IN OUR BEST

163
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:52,228
INTEREST AND NOT LIKE WE ARE

164
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,830
BREAKING UP A FREE-TRADE

165
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,464
ENVIRONMENT.

166
00:05:54,464 --> 00:05:55,898
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

167
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,401
RENEGOTIATING ARRANGEMENTES.

168
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,169
>> Bret: I MENTIONED THE

169
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,104
POLITICINGS AND YOU LOOK AT

170
00:06:01,104 --> 00:06:04,407
DIFFERENT PLACES THAT ARE

171
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:04,807
AFFECTED.

172
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:05,541
IT DOESN'T LINE UP TO HELP THE

173
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,309
REPUBLICAN AND PRESIDENT'S PARTY

174
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:09,145
IN THE MIDTERMS ON THIS

175
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:10,113
PARTICULAR ISSUE.

176
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:13,016
MORE DEMOCRATS LIKE BROWN AND

177
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:14,851
HIDECAMP AND OTHERS BENEFIT FROM

178
00:06:14,851 --> 00:06:15,451
THIS?

179
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:17,654
>>Y THINK IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

180
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:19,122
IT IS IT AN ELECTION THAT IS

181
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:20,256
A BASE ELECTION.

182
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:23,192
IT IS ALL ABOUT TURNING OUT

183
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:24,894
VOTES AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING

184
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:26,796
THAT TRUMP'S VOTERS HAVE AND

185
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:28,431
A CAMPAIGN PROMISE AND ONE OF

186
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:31,100
THE THINGS THAT ANIMATED THE

187
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,038
BASE TO TURN OUT FOR HIM IN

188
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:36,039
2016.

189
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,575
>> Bret: EVEN IF IT KNOCKS DOWN

190
