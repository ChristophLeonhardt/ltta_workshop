15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,690

16
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,790
views on privacy and fact that you put

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,380
yourself out there for the whole of the

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,210

30
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,070
seeing my videos and laughing at me I'm

31
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,110
i really love to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos but I'm</font>

32
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,659

33
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,350
and since receiving this email i have

34
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,840
actually do a little research on Millie

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,220
and it seems that she actually has died

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,920
take the glasses off<font color="#CCCCCC"> 230 and actually</font>

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,390
has started making videos which is

38
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,829
really cool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna link her</font>

39
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,659
channel below because genuinely I think

40
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,820
she's made a really colossally good

41
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,680
start and if you put back at my first

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,200
videos actually quite embarrassing so

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,549
she's doing a really good job so I'm

44
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,770
gonna link her below and aside from that

45
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,409
and I actually get the reason I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

46
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,490
making videos because I actually get

47
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,530
quite a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> and comments like that</font>

48
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,149
and and some questions like that and a

49
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,530
few emails like that and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I</font>

50
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,390
thought now was the time to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

51
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,399
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of video about it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address those</font>

68
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,480

the talk about about strangers and

73
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:41,370
stranger danger and just patient sterile

74
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,080
your personal information on the

75
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,450
internet which i completely agree with

76
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,350
don't give your number to anybody you

00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,160
robbed what and and that talk is still

85
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,540
valid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still clearly prove that</font>

86
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,950
however um there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of bad things</font>

87
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,030
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this world generally I think we can</font>

88
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">all agree on that I don't want this bad</font>

89
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,140
things to stop me<font color="#E5E5E5"> from doing good things</font>

90
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,269
things I like things are fun things<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

91
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">may even benefit others and and I don't</font>

92
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a barrier while I</font>

93
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,650
while I have a really over act for

94
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,970
instance what I haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever act</font>

95
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,829
imagination and I don't really like

96
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">going out night my own probably after</font>

97
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,790
which is you know night in Britain now

98
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,920
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about three o'clock and because I've</font>

99
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">seen so many movies I see things in my</font>

100
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,890
hand I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mallika what if this happens when</font>

101
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,120
this will happen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years later this</font>

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,400
will happen and but I still go out at

103
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,680
night and that doesn't mean to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that</font>

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,269
I walked home or like four in the

105
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,459
morning on my own like right in the

106
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,160
middle of commentary but I don't let

107
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">that stop me from doing normal things</font>

108
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,889
and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me youtube is a thing that comes</font>

109
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:56,970
naturally to me it's the thing that I

110
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,859
like to do I like to communicate people

111
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:00,359
and even though it seems like a weird

112
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:02,639
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to other people and for me it feels</font>

113
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,680
good it feels right it feels like I'm

114
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,790
enjoying it feels like I'm being

115
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,889
productive and it feels like a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

116
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:09,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">to procrastinate should I need to</font>

117
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,930
procrastinate in terms of people finding

118
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,780
me and that's something scary and I know

119
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,459
it happens to people i watch one tree

120
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,010
hill and I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it doesn't happen</font>

121
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,970
to me and on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand</font>

122
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,680
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only things I really give away</font>

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,150
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> towns that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i live in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because i</font>

124
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,910
live in two and and my first and

125
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,410
sometimes second name life<font color="#E5E5E5"> i haven't</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's not my channel is</font>

129
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,460
plastered with my surname but the same

130
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,870
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel the need to hide</font>

131
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,670
it completely it is quite an unusual

132
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,030
surname and however where I took my

133
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,840
famous writer journalist actor nothing's

134
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,030
gonna happen but where I to be everybody

135
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,820
would know my surname it is you know

136
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,380
it's bit dodgy foolishly at the same

137
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,930
time it's kind of normal also I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

138
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,820
know if what you have in the US or in

139
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,650
Canada Germany were you watching this

140
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,180
but in the UK we have thing called

141
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,460
yellow pages anyone can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find me</font>

142
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,440
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everybody in my whole</font>

143
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,750
city like comfort life like it's

144
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,490
published there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like my my address</font>

145
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">and with telephone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about everything and</font>

146
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty normal and around here</font>

147
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,370
for now you know we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the age</font>

148
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,830
of paranoia but at the moment that's

149
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,720
pretty normal to have your number<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

150
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,700
your name in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> yellow pages</font>

151
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,150
everything's risky and I don't feel very

152
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,530
at risk I don't feel like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

153
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,510
completely stupid and walking off a

154
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,270
cliff and so yeah that's my kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> view</font>

155
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,950
on that second thing that links into

156
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,830

160
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,300

<font color="#CCCCCC">is like do people think it's weird and</font>

162

somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who discovers the books let's</font>

170
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,140
just say way before most of my friends

171
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,090
and I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> covered it before a second</font>

172
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,130
one came out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I remember waiting for</font>

173
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,960
everything will go to come out no<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

none of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my friends listen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me I</font>

175
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,900

176
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,610
like guys need the riddles<font color="#CCCCCC"> book they're</font>

177
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,710
like shut up<font color="#CCCCCC"> gothic and now you can't go</font>

178
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,470
anywhere was wearing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> freaking</font>

179
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,700
gryffindor scarf like everybody loves it

180
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,789
and that's a good thing but everything

181
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">is weird until other people start liking</font>

182
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,910
it

183
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,240
um and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it just comes to a point</font>

184
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,300
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your life that can happen any point</font>

185
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,040
in your life a<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube and the issue of</font>

186
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube is one of the ways that can be</font>

187
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,290
introduced in July fanned that's

188
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,240
completely your choice but it is one of

189
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,070
the crossroads if you watch videos on

190
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube and there is a point where you</font>

191
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,810
ask yourself right have a username am I

192
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,860
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use my channel to upload videos</font>

193
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's just it's just a question that</font>

194
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,310
question will come again in your life in

195
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,870
a different form it probably's happened

196
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,840
before like em for me it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question</font>

197
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,430
happened before so YouTube wasn't too

198
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,500
hard because I'd already like originated

199
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,670
drama and so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but at the same</font>

200
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,300
time it's a question the fact the

201
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,880
existence of<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube and your activity</font>

202
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,360
within it however small is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question do</font>

203
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,580
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to upload</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> videos I think that's</font>

204
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,580
kind of roots into a bigger question of

205
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,970
who do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be and and that</font>

206
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's an important question why do you</font>

207
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,910
use the centrosome certain social

208
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,250
networking site that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my important who</font>

209
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,950
do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be colossally important</font>

210
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,190
so do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to be somebody who</font>

211
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,990
doesn't do things because they're afraid

212
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,010
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what other people think and it is</font>

213
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,040
possible to do things and still be

214
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,570
afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what other people think but do</font>

215
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,190
you only be once people who doesn't do

216
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,180
things because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what people think</font>

217
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,880
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're two different completely</font>

218
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,190
different people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am scared what people</font>

219
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,320

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a different level and it's definitely</font>

287
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">a more rewarding level and I say it's</font>
