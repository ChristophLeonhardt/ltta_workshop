1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:03,002
WHY IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE 

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,604
SUPER MOON WE SAW EARLIER IN 

3
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:08,240
THE YEAR WHERE IT APPEARED THE  

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,941
MOON WAS MUCH BIGGER. 

5
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:20,553
>> Reporter: THE MOON IS AT I 

6
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:24,390
TS -- FROM EARTH. 

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,897
TONIGHT IT WILL REACH THE 4,500-

8
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:31,297
KILOMETER POINT. 

9
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,499
>> THAT'S WHY IT'S GOING TO 

10
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:33,466
TAKE SO LONG. 

11
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,468
>> THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE 

12
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,303
ACTUALLY WILL HAVE THE LONGEST 

13
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,873
LUNAR ECLIPSE IN THE 21st 

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,273
CENTURY. 

15
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:43,576
THIS IS A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF SIX 

16
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:44,677
HOURS AND 14 MINUTES. 

17
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,814
WITH TOTALITY OF 103 MINUTES, 

18
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,081
ONE HOUR 43 MINUTES. 

19
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:50,517
>> SO EFFECTIVELY YOU AND I 

20
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,118
WILL NEVER SEE AN ECLIPSE LIKE 

21
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:52,451
THIS AGAIN. 

22
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:54,153
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S NOT GOING TO 

23
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:56,255
HAPPEN FOR WHAT OVER 100 YEARS. 

24
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:58,958
>> WE WILL SEE TOTALITY 

25
00:00:58,958 --> 00:00:59,726
ECLIPSES HAPPENING AGAIN BUT 

26
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,428
NOTHING THIS LONG. 

27
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:03,329
THIS IS THE LONGEST, YES. 

28
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,430
>> WHAT ELSE IS EXCITING ABOUT 

29
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,467
THESE OTHER THINGS THAT COULD 

30
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,235
HAPPEN TONIGHT AS WELL. 

31
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,005
>> WELL, WE HAVE THE METEOR 

32
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:12,405
SHOWER HAPPENING. 

33
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,807
SO WHEN THE MOON MOVES INTO 

34
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:15,107
TOTALITY. 

35
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:16,375
>> WHEN IT'S TOTALLY BLACK. 

36
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,543
>> TOTALLY BLACK LOCAL TIME AT 

37
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,111
21 MINUTES PAST 10. 

38
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:23,183
YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE A 

39
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,050
SHOOTING STAR OR TWO. 

40
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,084
>> WON'T THAT BE GREAT. 

41
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:31,090
>> YOU WILL ALSO HAVE MARS AT 

42
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,824
THE CLOSEST. 

43
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:32,592
YOU WILL SEE THAT ORANGE BLOB 

44
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,661
ON THE SIDE OF THE MOON THAT 

45
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:34,994
WILL BE MARS. 

46
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,197
OTHER THAN THE SAND STORM THAT 

47
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,764
TOOK PLACE IN MARS OVER THE 

48
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:39,598
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WE SHOULD 

49
00:01:39,598 --> 00:01:42,401
BE ABLE TO SEE A LOT OF DETAIL. 

50
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:45,338
THE SAND IS SUBSIDING FROM THE 

51
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:48,875
ORBIT OF MARS AND IT WILL BE A 

52
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,644
VERY INTERESTING OBJECT TO BE 

53
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:51,877
SEEING. 

54
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:53,179
>> MOST EXCITING IS A BLOOD 

55
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,014
MOON WHICH IS NOT A SCIENTIFIC 

56
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,816
MOON BUT IT'S WHAT'S SO 

57
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:57,083
EXCITING. 

58
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,284
WHAT GIVES THE MOON ITS RED 

59
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,019
COLOR AND IS IT AFFECTED BY 

60
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:00,920
THINGS LIKE POLLUTION AND 

61
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,421
DEBRIS. 

62
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,355
>> YES AND NO. 

63
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:05,625
BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS EARTH 

64
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:11,831
HAS GOT AN ATMOSPHERE AROUND 

65
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,566
IT. 

66
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,369
IT ACTS LIKE A LENS AND LIGHT 

67
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,204
WILL SCATTER AWAY AND THE RAYS 

68
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,039
OF LIGHT WILL TRAVEL THROUGH 

69
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,676
THE ATMOSPHERE AND BE SLIGHTLY 

70
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:29,282
BENT LIKE YOU WOULD BEND LIGHT 

71
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,284
THROUGH AN AT PHOS FEAR. 

72
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:35,455
THAT'S WHY YOU WILL ACTUALLY 

73
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,290
SEE THAT THE MOON PROGRESSIVELY 

74
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:37,623
GETS DARKER. 

75
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:42,128
BECAUSE THAT WILL GET MORE OR 

76
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,064
LESS IN THE CONE OF THE SHADOW. 

77
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,133
>> WE KNOW IN MODERN TIMES 

78
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,935
WE'RE ABLE TO PREDICT WITH 

79
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:49,969
PRECISION WHEN A LUNAR ECLIPSE 

80
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,505
WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE. 

81
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,441
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE. 

82
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,645
A BLOOD MOON COULD BE A THOUGHT 

83
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,948
THERE COULD BE CALAMITY 

84
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,182
SURROUNDING THIS EVENT. 

85
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,251
>> IN GENERAL, SOLAR ECLIPSES 

86
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,352
THE LUNAR ECLIPSE IN THOSE DAYS 

87
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:11,524
SAW THIS AS A BAD OE MEN. 

88
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,627
THEY SAW THAT THERE'S -- BAD 

89
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:18,097
OMEN AND THERE'S DROUGHT COMING 

90
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,232
FOR SEVEN YEARS. 

91
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,402
AND EVERY NOW AND AGAIN WE 

92
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,536
ACTUALLY HIT A POINT WHERE THEY 

93
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,637
GET INTO EACH OTHER'S WAYS. 

94
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:28,908
THIS YEAR WE WOULD ACTUALLY SEE 

95
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:35,181
A TOTAL OF FIVE ECLIPSES, TWO 

96
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,748
LUNAR ONE HAPPENS IN JANUARY. 

97
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:40,853
WE CAN NOW PREDICT THAT THE 

98
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,255
NEXT LUNAR ECLIPSE TOTALITY 

99
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,657
WE'LL SEE WILL ONLY HAPPEN IN 

100
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:44,857
2025. 

101
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,459
EVEN THOUGH IT IS ANOTHER LUNAR 

102
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,627
ECLIPSE VISIBLE FROM THE 

103
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,396
NORTHERN AMERICAN AREA IN 

104
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:50,963
JANUARY OF 2019. 

105
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:53,799
IT WILL NOT BE VISIBLE FOR US. 

106
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,568
>> Reporter: THERE'S ANOTHER 

107
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,269
EXTREME HAPPENING. 

108
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,941
IN ODDEN  -- OLDEN TIMES IT WAS 

109
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,077
A PREDICTOR OF DROUGHT, HEAT 

110
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,979
WAVES, WILDFIRES IN ATHENS THEN 

111
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,381
FLASH FLOODS AND ELSEWHERE 

112
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,114
AROUND THE GLOBE. 

113
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:10,450
DOES THIS ECLIPSE AFFECT THE 

114
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,885
WEATHER IN ANY WAY? 

115
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:13,986
>> NO IT'S MERE COINCIDENCE. 

116
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:18,491
IT IS PURELY THE OBJECTS IN THE 

117
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,892
SKY FOLLOWING THEIR AGE OF 

118
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:20,192
PAUSE. 

119
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:21,961
AND YES IT HAPPENS EVERY NOW 

120
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,563
AND AGAIN THEY CROSS PATHS AND 

121
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,765
WE SEE ECLIPSES BUT IT DOES NOT 

122
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,168
INFLUENCE ANY HAPPENINGS ON THE 

123
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:29,469
EARTH. 

124
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,537
SO NO, THE BLOOD MOON MOST THEY 

125
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,337
ARE -- 

126
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:33,672
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT TONYA. 

127
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:38,478
NO BAD OMENS JUST A LOT OF
