last night before Trump announced his pick the Democrats had a couple of hundred protesters outside the court with prefabricated signs for a variety of potential nominees that Trump could have chosen as in no matter what he did no matter who he chose they were going to protest it that's the age were in now some left-wing lobby groups actually sent out their pre-written attacked press releases look at this one here they forgot to fill in the blank for them up in these name xxxx the nomination of xx know you're supposed to put in the name there but despite the fake outrage it serves a purpose you know it forces the President to think carefully about who is going to choose they generally have to have some real talent and real merit and real track record before being nominated and they generally have to be ideologically temperate enough to carry the Senate at Kennedy who was supported sorry appointed by Reagan was pretty liberal for a Republican appointee he upheld the abortion case roe v wade though he also ruled against partial birth abortions which are as gruesome as they sound Kenley wrote the gay marriage ruling in the States he supported race-based affirmative action he ruled that Guantanamo Bay terrorists have certain legal rights in other words he's the kind of a Republican that the media loves I don't think Brett Kavanaugh will be that way again it's hard to separate the real facts from the pre fabricated complaints from the Democrat outrage machine but it does appear that Kavanagh is more conservative than his mentor he says he stands by roe v wade because as a conservative he stands by precedent but that doesn't mean there are no limits for example last year he wrote a dissent to a DC Circuit Court ruling that an illegal immigrant teenager in detention was entitled to get an abortion that's a whole bundle of left-wing hot buttons right there isn't Cavanaugh said the US Constitution did not grant quote a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in US government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand unquote it would be tough to point to a provision in the Constitution that says otherwise but there's a judge to say it that's the thing about constitutional conservatives they say that the constitutional means something and it can't be changed with every passing political fashion that's we left us hate that they're always trying to get rid of the First Amendment that protects freedom of speech the Second Amendment that protects firearms ownership they're always trying to create counterfeit rights like the right not to be offended strict constructionist say no let's just read the Constitution how it is Cavanagh it looks like a conservative to me he's for the second amendment he objected to a DC Court ban on rifles he has opposed overreach by environmental regulators I like the look of him and that's the thing about winning elections is Barack Obama kept telling Republicans for eight years winning losing has consequences Hillary Clinton did not win she does not get to choose the nominees that's just how it is and the rules that the Democrats put in place during Obama's eight years in power to allow Obama greater latitude without having to bother with Republican approval in the Senate well although those powers are now inherited by Trump that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch The Daily Show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
