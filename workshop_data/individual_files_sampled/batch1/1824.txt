anger outrage disgust on display in the nation's capital a sizable protest out to tell US senators don't vote to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court annalee Lea Mejia came from New Jersey to help spread the word and a few signs she believes Christine Blasi Ford who testified before the Senate that Cavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school I'm just fired up about the idea that we would have incredibly accused sexual assailant confirmed on to the Supreme Court is unfair unjust to women and honestly men across the country but it's not just the liberal side that is angry about this polls show that the Republicans are really fired up in fact before the Kavanaugh nomination a lot of Republicans told pollsters they weren't all that excited to vote in the upcoming congressional elections that has changed many polls showed Democrats and Republicans equally excited to vote for their side the vote was delayed by a week so the FBI could investigate but their classified report has just further deepened the divide it's a complete report it's a background check I'm confident the FBI did a good job they were not hindered in any way so it's very frustrating even the things I read and I heard the chairman of the committee say that there's no hint of misconduct in plain English what I just read there are hints of misconduct the FBI didn't interview for it or the witnesses she suggested and many other people who know Cavanaugh say they tried to talk to the FBI but were turned away further feeling suspicion and division in a fierce fight that is playing out in the capital and on the streets for the future of the highest court and likely control of the Congress come January patty : al-jazeera Washington
