WEEK YOU, SHANNON. Shannon: 'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE UPDATE. IN YET ANOTHER SIGN OF THE TURNED OUT THIS CONFIRMATION IS BATTLE IS TAKING, JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS WITHDRAWN FROM TEACHING AT HARVARD LAW THIS WINTER AS SIGNATURES ARE GATHERED OBJECTING TO HIM AT THE UNIVERSITY. THEY SAY THAT IT SHOULD MAKE EVERY AMERICAN THINK ABOUT THE LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR COUNTRY. AND AN OP-ED PIECE, HE WRITES "WE NOW LIVE IN AN AGE OF SEXUAL McCARTHYISM. EVERY PERSON REGARDLESS OF HIS STATUS THE KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS WE WOULD EXPECT FOR OURSELVES IF WE WERE ACCUSED." NEW TOURNAMENT. SEXUAL McCARTHYISM. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY AND A GEORGETOWN CENTER. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. AND ALL OF YOU TONIGHT. I WANT TO START WITH SOMETHING THAT THE TOP DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE, CHUCK SCHUMER, HAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS PROCESS AND WHAT IT'S ABOUT. DEMOCRATS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN DELAYING FOR THE SAKE OF DELAY. THIS CANNOT BE COMPLETED QUICKLY. BUT IT MUST BE DONE RIGHT. Shannon: MOLLY, WHO DEFINES HOW IT IS DONE RIGHT, OR THAT IT HAS BEEN DONE RIGHT? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, DEMOCRATS DURING THE HEARING SAID THAT THEY WOULD LIKE AN FBI INVESTIGATION, AND THEY HAVE GOTTEN THAT FBI INVESTIGATION. AS SOON AS THEY GOT IT, WE STARTED HEARING THAT THEY HAD MORE THINGS THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE SPECIFIC. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A HISTORY OF DOING THINGS LIKE THIS, THEY KNOW HOW TO DO INVESTIGATIONS LIKE THIS. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE ANTHONY WEINER LAPTOP, THEY TOOK CARE OF THAT IN JUST A FEW DAYS. ALLEGATIONS AGAINST CLARENCE THOMAS, THAT ALSO TOOK JUST A FEW DAYS. DO WE KNOW WHO ALL OF THE WITNESSES ARE? WE KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY, WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK. IT IS A GOOD THING TO BE DONE. I THINK IT WILL QUELL A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THIS. IF THERE IS ANY EVIDENCE, ANY EVIDENCE AT ALL WHATSOEVER TO SUPPORT THESE INCREASINGLY RIDICULOUS ALLEGATIONS, IT WILL CONFIRM OR DENY IT. Shannon: THIS IS WHAT MITCH McCONNELL HAD TO SAY. THE GOALPOST IS SHIFTING. BUT THE GOAL HASN'T MOVED AN INCH. WE WILL BE VOTING THIS WEEK. Shannon: WHAT IS YOUR OBJECTION? I AM NOT OBJECTING THAT MITCH McCONNELL IS OBJECTING TO THIS. OKAY, HYPOTHETICALLY, IF IT DOES, IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO ASSESS ON THE BASIS OF FBI RECORD AS WELL AS THE TOTALITY OF THE RECORD OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY AND HIS JUDICIAL RECORD, AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. WE WILL SEE THEN THAT HE WON'T BE CONFIRMED. I AM NOT PERSUADED Shannon: YOU DON'T THINK HE IS TO MAKE IT. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN ASKING THIS WHOLE TIME, WE NEED THE FBI INVESTIGATION, IT ONLY TOOK THREE DAYS FOR ANITA HILL. WHY IS THIS ONE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? THIS IS WHAT I AM NOT SURPRISED BY. THE LATEST POLL NOW PUTS 40% OF AMERICANS WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THIS, 50% ARE WOMEN, BY THE WAY IF YOU'RE IN MITCH McCONNELL IS LOOKING AT THIS, THIS IS ALL A POLITICAL MOVE FOR HIM. TO FAST-TRACK THIS THING. JEFF FLAKE CAME OUT AND SAID TODAY Shannon: IF THE FBI INVESTIGATION IS DONE, WHAT IS YOUR OBJECTION? I THINK THAT THEY WILL THEN HAVE TO ASSESS ON THE BASIS OF THE STRUCTURE. I THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO HAVE OBJECTIONS, THAT HE HAS A VERY DANGEROUS JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY, AS WELL AS CONCERNS ABOUT HIS TEMPERAMENT. Shannon: YOU THINK THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THE MAN. THIS IS ABOUT STOPPING A CONSERVATIVE FROM MAKING IT ONTO THE COURT. THIS WOULD BE ABOUT STOPPING THE NEXT ONE THAT WAS NOMINATED IN HIS PLACE. AND, WORST-CASE SCENARIO, IF HE MAKES IT ON THE COURT, THIS IS ABOUT DELEGITIMIZING THE SUPREME COURT, A FIVE VOTE SUPREME COURT. THIS IS ABOUT DELEGITIMIZING OUR UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, SOMETHING THAT WE WERE TOLD IN THE PAST WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING, BUT THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IF KAVANAUGH SHOULD GO ON THE COURT, THEY WANT ANY RULINGS THAT COME FROM THE COURT TO BE DAMAGED. Shannon: DO YOU THINK WE ARE STILL ALONG THE SAME VEIN OF THE PRESIDENT DID NOT ELECTED, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE HAS TO BE REPEALED. THEY QUESTION THE VERY LEGITIMACY OF HIM, WHETHER HE WAS HELPED BY RUSSIA, SO THAT IT BRINGS INTO QUESTION ANYTHING THAT HE DECIDES. WE ARE GOING FROM ONE INSTITUTION AFTER ANOTHER. ONE OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTIONS AFTER ANOTHER AND IT DELEGITIMIZING THEM WHEN THEY GET IN THE WAY OF THE OTHER SIDE. I THINK THIS IS ABOUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT. THIS IS A QUALIFIED JUDGE WHO HAS HAD HIS NAME AND REPUTATION AND HONOR COMPLETELY DRAGGED THROUGH THE MUD. IN THIS COUNTRY, WE TENDED TO HAVE A BELIEF THAT PEOPLE ARE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. WE HAVE A RESPECT FOR DUE PROCESS. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE THEIR LIVES DESTROYED THROUGH ALLEGATIONS. YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF OTHER INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE MEDIA JUST THROW THAT AWAY AND SAY THAT THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS ALL AMERICANS, LEFT OR RIGHT. YOU WANT TO DETER ANY FUTURE PEOPLE, FOR FEAR THAT THEY ARE GOING TO UNDERGO WHAT BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS GONE THROUGH. Shannon: DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT THAT? HE STARTS TAKING NOMINATIONS TO THE SUPREME COURT. DO YOU THINK THAT FOLKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE SHOULD BE WORRIED? I THINK THAT WHEN MAYOR GARLAND IS DENIED EVEN A SINGLE MEETING, WE LOOKED AT THAT AND SAID WHAT THE HECK IS HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON? WE ARE STILL VERY DISMAYED BY THE PROFOUND POLITICAL CYNICISM. I DO THINK THAT IS A VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERN. THIS IS A PHENOMENAL CONSPIRACY. BUT LET'S KEEP IN MIND THAT PROFESSOR FORD CAME FORWARD AND OFFERED UP HER CONCERNS AND THE LETTER BEFORE BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME COURT. Shannon: DIANNE FEINSTEIN HELD THE LETTER. WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS HIDDEN, AS TO SUPPOSE THAT THIS WAS SOME SORT OF PREMEDITATED CONSPIRACY ON HER PART IS JUST LAUGHABLE. YOU NEED TO HAVE EVIDENCE INSTEAD OF JUST STORIES. SINCE YOU BROUGHT UP MERRICK GARLAND, I THINK THAT IS A REASONABLE THING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. THANK A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T DRAG HIS NAME THROUGH THE MUD OR ACCUSE HIM OF BEING RAPIST ABSOLUTELY, I WOULD HATE TO SEE ANYONE HAVE AN ALLEGATION LIKE THAT, I AM VERY GLAD, AND I THINK MOST REASONABLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR THIS, THAT WE HAVE AN FBI INVESTIGATION THAT CAN HELP BUILD A FACTUAL RECORD. Shannon: SO WHAT DO YOU TO SAY? A VOTE AT THE END OF THE WEEK IT, AND IT SHOULD GO FOR KAVANAUGH. I AGREE WITH THAT, AND THE FBI INVESTIGATION, SUCH AS IT IS, WILL BE TRASHED. Shannon: I HAVE A FEELING THAT WHOEVER FAVORS OR DOESN'T FAVOR, I THINK THAT THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH IT.
