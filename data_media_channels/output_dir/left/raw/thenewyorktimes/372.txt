1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,240
“These are African
wild dogs in Botswana.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,850
Sneezing.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,490
They don't have allergies,
they didn't sniff pepper.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,090
That's how they vote — sort of.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,940
The group is trying to decide
whether to go on a hunt,

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,540
and the sneezers are
saying, 'I'm in.'

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,615
Scientists studied the wild
dogs because they're intrigued

8
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:27,300
at how animals make
group decisions.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,560
All sorts of animals
face this problem.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,900
Meerkats getting on the
move, gorillas, some monkeys.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,230
Even honeybees signal when
they're ready to move — with sounds.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,510
These audible votes let the
group know if it has a quorum.

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,000
That's what scientists call
the minimum number needed

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,770
for the group to act.

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,610
Animals use all sorts of sounds,
but no other creatures were

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,070
known to use sneezing
for this purpose.

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,980
Scientists were amazed.”

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,890
“It's an unbelievable observation
of actually connecting

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,390
the sneezes to their departure.”

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,489
“First, the dogs all mill around,
and sometimes they go off on a hunt.

21
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,550
Sometimes they lie down
and go back to sleep.

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,080
Researchers found the best way
to predict what will happen was

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,170
the number of sneezes.

24
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,030
One qualification —

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,790
no one knows whether the
activity is voluntary,

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,842
like a real vote, or
if it just happens.”

27
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:25,171
[Sneezes]

28
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,274
“Oh!”

29
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:27,080
“Bless you.”

30
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,560
“I'm sorry.

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:00:00,000
Like a sneeze.”
