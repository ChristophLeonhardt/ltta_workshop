will you recognize Crimea as part of Russia when you meet it's an interesting question because you know long before I got here President Obama allowed that to happen that was on his watch not on my watch you know people like to say oh Crimea but the fact is they built bridges to Crimea they just opened a big bridge that was started years ago they built I think a submarine port substantially added billions of dollars so that was on Barack Obama's watch that was not on Trump's watch what I have allowed it to happen no I would not have allowed it to happen but he did allow it to happen so that was his determination what will happen with Crimea from this point on that I can't tell you but I'm not happy about Crimea but again that was Barack Obama's watch not Trump's watch you
