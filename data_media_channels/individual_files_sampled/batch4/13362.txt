the state of California is preparing to pass a law that would require all California businesses to put at least one woman on its board of directors Governor Jerry Brown who's preparing to sign the bill told reporters quote it is important for big strong men like myself to protect the right of women to be on boards how else will these gentle delicate creatures attain positions of power in a cutthroat business world that was never intended for the sweet helpless likes of them unquote bill Monning the majority leader of the state Senate which has already passed the bill issued a statement saying quote no longer will California businesses have to deal with messy boardrooms sloppy conference tables or hastily made lunches with this bill we plan to make sure that each and every board in California will feel the civilizing touch of a woman as well as that fragrant flowery smell that wafts into the room every time a lady enters I feel sure that from now on every man who runs a business in this state will be a little better behaved a little better dressed and yes maybe a touch more charming just knowing a member of the fairer sex is in the room with them I know from personal experience that every time I see a woman enter my office her intriguing grace her smooth shapely limbs and the unsettling curves of her outline and I forgot what I was going to say unquote the bill also got a push from chairman of the California Democratic Party Women's Caucus Christine Pelosi Pelosi who is often said to take after her mother House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the California bill would provide quote a fine reminder that every woman in California must have left her purse somewhere but can't remember where and that raises the question Who am I unquote miss Pelosi then drew a mouth on her forehead with lipstick and walked into a broom closet where she remained for the next seven hours in short California remains a symbol of all that America can and will be if

sign that they shouldn't be there so III we got to talk about this anonymous op-ed in The New York Times and also Cory Booker making an absolute spectacle and full of himself by breaking the Senate rules to release papers that he hopes will embarrass Brett Kavanaugh I just want to say I am so glad I am so glad that the rule of law and decency are being protected by chuckleheads like Cory Booker an anonymous unelected New York Times guy who are breaking the rule of law and the rules of decency in order to protect the rule of law and the rule of decency I mean that's basically what's going on and before before you let any of this get into your head because I've been telling you all week America is in the grip of an on crisis this is not a crisis we're not it's not a constitutional crisis it's not a political crisis it's not any kind of a crisis everything is going fine I just want to remind you of this let me read to you let me read something to you about a book being published in this stunning expose the author pulls back the curtain on one of the most secretive white houses in history he reveals a callow thin-skinned arrogant president with messianic dreams of grandeur supported by a cast of true believers all of them united by right-wing politics and an amateur's understanding of executive leadership okay this tells you how the president has taken more of a role in making foreign policy than any president since Richard Nixon with disastrous results and how his family are the real powers behind the White House throne now I've changed that a little bit because it was actually about Obama it's actually from a book called the amateur by Edward Klein about Obama it was a number one New York Times bestseller and it made no splash whatsoever because of course the CNN ABC CBS NBC the New York Times didn't highlight it every single day and that atmosphere of hysteria is what they are trying to create that is the whole point of what they're doing and of course they're doing it right now when Brett Kavanaugh is being is up for confirmation to the Supreme Court and they can't lay a glove on them they can't get them so they're just going out of their way to just make everything oh my god it's chaos it's crisis this is that yeah not so much I want to really take a look at this anonymous unelected New York Times guy writing an op-ed in which he says basically don't worry folks unelected anonymous New York Times guy is secretly running the country okay this is what he says and you know it is apps well let me let me talk about it first you know they asked the New York Times they they went to the editor of the New York Times blue Loreen prevarication the third and they said why would you publish take it you know take this extraordinary step of publishing an anonymous op-ed attacking the president and here's his response I'm sorry that's why they're doing it there is erekle ah so it says many of the senior administer officials this is supposed to be a high-level administration official we have no idea what that means there are hundreds of people who'd fall under that category I would be willing to bet I would be willing to bet a certain amount of money that it's nobody we've ever heard of they're talking to their about Mike Pence in a pig's eye they love pigs I know it's lies not pens it's not mattes there's nobody like that is some minor function many of the senior officials and Trump's own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations I would know I am one of them Thanks anonymous unelected New York Times guy for trying to overturn the will of the people to save America sort of I kind of I don't understand what you're doing all right but I believe this is happening I first of all I believe this always happens I believe this happens in every administration there are people kind of you know maneuvering behind the scenes is a complex machine and they're people who think they're more important than they are all right but but and at Axios where they actually have some decent reporting it's not like the New York Times that the ataxias they have some sources they say that other people called them up and said you know there are a lot of us who sort of do things like this sort of Trump is you know out of control so we do all these things so anyway the guy goes on to be clear ours is not the popular resistance of the left we want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous but we believe our first duty is to the country and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our Republic that is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while fording mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office the root of the problem is the president's immorality so that's the first clue to who this is obviously an all seem creature who can look into the president's soul and find that there is no guiding principle there says anyone who works with him so that's the first clue we're just trying to narrow this down I think we've got it it's now it's not a human being right it's an immortal creature anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision-making although he was elected as a Republican the president shows little affinity for ideals long espoused by conservatives free minds free markets and free people at best he has invoked these ideals and scripted settings at worst he has attacked them outright I bet this was written by somebody at the Times I mean they may not obviously they had a source on night accusing them of making it up but I bet it was written by them in addition to his mass marketing of the notion that the press is the enemy of the people that was bad president Trump's impulses are generally anti trade and anti-democratic don't get me wrong there are bright spots that the near ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture effective deregulation historic tax reform a more robust military and more let's just pause for a minute there to talk about the more then president Trump's first year I mean let's let me quote Dan henagar in the Wall Street Journal because he puts his name on what he writes in president Trump's first year those policies included the immigrant travel ban news of which spread throughout the world but with the help of a Republican Congress his policies also included the reversal of the Obama eras multitudinous economic regulation December a 40% reduction the corporate tax rate in the six months between December and summer vacation the US economy achieved full employment we now have a labor shortage unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics at historic lows after eight years of suppression a still powerful US economy has been liberated here are three headlines from tuesday's online journal us factory sector clock strongest growth in 14 years consumer sentiment boosted by job optimism US auto sales maintain momentum for now but thank heavens thank heavens on an anonymous unelected new york times guy is on the scene doing whatever the hell he thinks he's doing I got a pause for just a minute talk about blue apron I love blue apron great food delivered to your home it's

to do all right so let's let us go on he says he says yes all these successes says anonymous unelected New York Times guys but these successes have come despite not because of the president's leadership style which is impetuous adversarial petty and ineffective well obviously not ineffective right since all the stuff is happening but okay from the White House to executive branch departments and agencies senior officials will privately admit that their daily disbelief at the commander-in-chief's comments and actions most are working to insulate their operations from his whims meeting with him meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails he engages in repetitive rants and his impulsiveness results in half-baked ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back there is no telling whether he might change his mind from one minute to the next a top official complained to me recently so you were going like what President Trump president Trump who says things and then changes is my wife what you know this is they had to publish this anonymously because no one would come forward and say president Trump is difficult to deal with and has a big mouth I mean no one would say that except everyone the entire country would say that there's like a 325 million people in this country okay yeah Trump doing a great job but he's got a big mouth and he changes his mind a lot all right they were right behavior would be would be more stupidest editorial the erratic behavior would be more concerning if it weren't for unsung heroes in and around the White House who do you think he's referring to I bet I know who he's referring I think it's anonymous unelected New York Times guy he's referring to some of his aides have been cast as villains in by the media but in private they have gone to great lengths to keep bad decisions contained to the west wing though they are clearly not always successful it may be cold comfort in this chaotic era is your life chaotic my life is varying smooth I don't know who things are you know the work is good you know the stock market's up everything you know Isis is gone remember Isis remember Obama's Isis that he created by pulling out of a rack too soon and not doing anything about the red line yeah that's gone I'm feeling pretty good but okay it's a chaotic era a ton an anonymous unelected New York Times guys house but Americans should know that there are adults in the room we fully recognize what is happening and we are trying to do what's right even when Donald Trump won't so don't worry don't worry America you elected a guy by legal means but he's not in charge do not worry our democracy is being protected by unelected anonymous New York Times guy who is controlling everything behind the scenes he says there's a two-track presidency take foreign policy in public and private president Trump shows a preference for autocrats and dictators but astute observers have noted that the rest of the administration is operating on another track one where countries like Russia are called out for meddling and punished accordingly and we're allies around the world are engaged as peers rather than ridiculed as rivals think about that for a second who's punishing the Russians that on an unelected anonymous New York Times guy or Trump I mean it's Trump doing it you know he's got to sign off on this stuff this isn't the work of the so-called deep State as if it's the work of the steady state oh that's a new a new term for unelected anonymous people controlling our government instead of the people we send to control it that's a new words the steady state not the deep state so nothing to fear there nothing to worry about there given the instability many witness there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th amendment the bigger concern is not what mr. Trump has done to the presidency but rather what we as a nation have allowed him to do to us we have sunk low with him and allowed our discourse to be stripped of civility and here's the giveaway Senator John McCain put it best in his farewell letter all Americans should heed his words and break free of the tribalism trap with the high aim of uniting through our shared values and love of this great nation we may no longer have Senator McCain but we will always like the 15th day of his funeral in the New York table but we will always have his example a lodestar for restoring honor to public life and our national dialogue mr. Trump may fear such honorable men but we should review him that's this is a giveaway right this is a giveaway this is a guy John McCain promised to repeal Obamacare then voted not to repeal it for absurd reasons he tried to limit free speech through mccain-feingold he was no one's idea of civil to anyone even at his funeral they were talking about what a pain in the neck he was and what nasty he could be this is what I'm trying to say about this is this is a meaningless op-ed that could have been written during the Obama administration but wouldn't have been published that just that Edward Clym thing I read at the beginning tells you there were people then there then although he Obama unlike Trump Obama surrounded himself with sycophants Obama surrounded himself with like oh you want to silence people through the IRS okay oh you want to use the Justice Department to you know spy on a arrival campaign okay you know Trump at least has people who push back and they wouldn't be there if he didn't want him there look I'm not pushing Trump I think everything this guy is saying about the chaos and the White House probably true I think we all know that Trump is a chaotic character and a lot of ways Trump is like share some of Obama's bad features in that he is arrogant narcissistic he would like Obama he doesn't know what he doesn't know unlike Obama he's following great policies that are doing great for the country and remember remember when they talk about John McCain BS I call BS on this because there's still last time I checked only two parties in this country there's still two parties in this country and one of them is pulling off this clown show if this you know remember in Woodward's book they called the Trump administration crazy town they called it raise neon well the RNC has put out this advertisement showing you what crazytown really looks like this is this is the crazy town ad run it please get up in the face of some Congress people Republican leaders and President Trump don't get it like I just don't even know why they're part of uprising supported the country yeah yeah so that the problem is Trump Trump is crazytown the problem is Trump is he's endangered let's just go over to Cavanaugh the Cavanaugh hearing where Cory Booker who is obviously running for president office he will never hold not in my lifetime not in your lifetime he will never be President of the United States but let but he is doing everything he can so they're questioning Cavanaugh on roe v wade he says yes it's a precedent it's a very strong precedent but precedents can't be overturned he they questioned him on guns he has the answer on guns he's just not giving them anything to tear them apart on so thank heavens thank heavens if unelected anonymous New York Times guy is not running our government Cory Booker is gonna take matters into our own hands own hands and protect the rule of decency in law by violating the rules of the Senate and the rules of decency and releasing private papers classified papers from the Bush administration and here he is announcing telling you what a hero he is I knowingly violated the rules that were put for and I'm told that the community confidential rules have knowing constant consequences and so sir I come from a long line as all of us do as Americans and understand what that kind of civil disobedience is and I understand the consequences so I am right now before your before your process is finished I'm going to release the email about racial profiling and I understand that that the penalty comes with potential I'll sting from the Senate and if senator Cornyn believes that I violated Senate rules III openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that email right now and I'm releasing it to expose at number one the emails are being withheld from the public have nothing to do with national security nothing to jeopardize the sanctity of those ideals that I hold dear instead what I'm releasing this document right now to show sir is that we have a process here for a person the highest office in the land for a lifetime appointment we're rushing through this before me my colleagues can even breathe and digest the information everything in that statement is untrue especially the hi it's not the highest office in the land they're not rushing through it they've got all the papers they need they've had them for a long time the papers that they are looking for are mostly classified they're just trying to delay things hoping that the midterms will turn everything around not gonna happen Mitch McConnell has got it is very much in control of this process and unless something explodes this guy is going to be confirmed to the Supreme Court and then they will have wasted their panic because I think Trump is going to continue to be president and there's gonna be one of the older one of the older Supreme Court justices what is gonna kick and then he's they're really gonna have time reason to panic I just before we're gonna go to Henry Olson just a minute talk about the election before we do I just want to read something I meant to read this yesterday but I want to read it today that every American should read every American should read and in Scalia's dissent in Oberg felt the decision of the Supreme Court that decreed gay marriage or right and you know where I stand on this you know that I'm perfectly happy for there to be gay marriage I don't care about that at all but here's something I do care about I want to read this because this is the vision that we're trying to defend it is not about roe v wade it is not about Oberkfell is it's about who runs America and what America is supposed to be like I'm just gonna read the first two paragraphs very quickly this is Scalia dissenting on the gay rights decision the substance of today's decree is not of immense personal importance to me the law can recognize as marriage whatever sexual attachments and living arrangements it wishes and can Accord them favorable civil consequences from tax treatment to rights of inheritance those civil consequences in the public approval that conferring the name of marriage evidences can perhaps have adverse social effects but no more adverse than the effects of many other controversial laws so it is not of special importance to me what the law says about marriage it is of overwhelming importance however who it is that rules me today's decree says that my ruler and the ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court the opinion in these cases is the farthest extension in fact and the furthest extension one can even imagine of the courts claimed power to create liberties that the Constitution and it's amendments neglect to mention this practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine always accompanied by extravagant praise of Liberty Rob's the people of the most important Liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Independence and won in the revolution of 1776 the freedom to govern themselves and this is the part that always breaks my heart is everyone should read this and you should read it from beginning to end Scalia says until the courts put a stop to it public debate over same-sex marriage displayed American democracy at its best individuals on both sides of the issue passionately but respectfully attempted to persuade their fellow citizens to accept their views Americans consider the arguments and put the question to a vote the electorate's of eleven states either directly or through their representatives chose to expand the traditional definition of marriage many more decided not to win or lose advocates for both sides continued pressing their cases secure in the knowledge that an electoral loss can be negated by a later electoral win that is exactly how our system of government is supposed to work it is that system of government this is me talking now it is that system of government we are trying to defend it is that system of government cory booker an unelected new york times guy are fighting against and whether trump is an abstruse chaotic doofus or not the system right now is delivering more of that American Way of life that way of life people fought and died for in 1776 and you know what I don't care what on an anonymous unelected New York Times guy says and I don't care what Cory Booker says and I hope he is thrown for the Senate just for my own personal amusement but but that is what we're fighting for and we shouldn't be distracted by all the craziness on either side have we got Henry here fantastic Henry Olson is a senior fellow at the ethics and Public Policy Center a think tank in Washington DC his pre-election predictions are the best I mean the guy is one of the great observers of electoral politics he writes regularly for American greatness his last book is the working-class Republican Ronald Reagan and the return of blue-collar conservatism a really different look at Ronald Reagan you can find it on amazon.com Henry it's good to see you again good to see you so let let's begin well let's get to the thing to the important point immediately what are you seeing in the midterms upcoming well Ari right now it looks like the Democrats will take the house publicans will hold the Senate they might gain a seat or two but it's all very fluid you've got all of these announcements about the president's supposed mental state you've got the plea bargain that seems to have dropped his job approval slightly but it's already started to rebound and polls in the last few days so right now it looks good but not great for the Democrat so if if the economy is as good as it is if we're at peace you know things are going well is this all about Trump's personality uh well it's about Trump's personality Trump's character and for many people Trump's policies that there are a lot of people who mask their disagreement with his policies especially on immigration and trade by reference to his character or his personality when they would be 75 to 90% as opposed to somebody who was completely the most literate person since Shakespeare who had the same thing so it's it's all of that mixed in where do you see the power line in terms of the electorate if you were a Republican candidate what would you be looking at in your district obviously you have to speak generally because you can't speak to every district but what would you be looking for in your district to who would you be looking to sway well there's basically two types of districts there's districts where the key voter is the former Republican who doesn't like Donald Trump they tend to be in the suburbs and high-income educated so if you're in Orange County and you're one of the endangered Republicans there that's who you're looking to the rest of the country it's the Obama Trump voter the person who didn't like Mitt Romney the person who didn't vote for John McCain but voted for Donald Trump and in those places you want to look at them and you want to ignore all what the Washington people are saying which is all focused on the wrong type of owner okay when you say focus on the wrong type of odor you mean the base yeah the Washington people will tell you to focus first on the base and then on the defective Republicans or the defecting Republicans whether they're defective depends on how you feel about the president but for a lot of these people success is going to come by winning the voters who didn't like Obama and put them in office in 2014 or 2012 em who happened to be the same people who also crossed over to vote for Donald Trump but don't generally like national Republicans you focus on that voter and you can win but if you don't know that voters out there you're not going to be sending the message that they'll hear and you know if it's you're just the same old Republican versus the same old Democrat these people like same old Democrat mm-hmm I I have this theory that Trump is more popular among blacks than blacks will admit to pollsters I saw today in the LA Times I think it was a new poll showing that over 90 percent of blacks are going to vote Democrat in the upcoming races do you believe that there's any possibility that there is a hidden tide in Trump's favor people who don't want to support openly support Donald Trump but see that they have jobs and see that the economy is going well and might go behind the curtain and vote for him you know maybe but it's not going to be large that generally people tell the truth to bolsters we know that people who are supportive of a character or a party who or which is disapproved of by the people who run media or business will tend to shy away from that but the effect is only a couple of points so if Trump and the Republicans are sitting at 40 maybe the real figure is 43 but that's a far cry from 50 so yes but it's not very large okay now Trump has done a lot of the things that you've talked about in your in your book the working-class Republican Ronald Reagan on the return of blue-collar conservatism you say what you've been saying for years basically which is that the Republican Party has been ignoring a working class that is no longer as well is more concerned about social programs that will keep them from falling off the bottom rung of the ladder and that Reagan was concerned about Trump seems to have appealed to them has he has he not and and if so if so why isn't he fulfilling you know your idea that this would win back a majority because he's alienating the suburban heights now the thing is Ronald Reagan found a way to unite suburban moderate to moderately conservative Republicans with these working-class voters and keep them in the same town Donald Trump not only has a problem with attracting those suburban voters he actively seems to relish driving them away and if what you're doing is swapping out Romney suburban i'ts or Obama Trump working-class voters you're just rearranging the deckchairs on the losing Titanic you're just going from first class to steerage as far as your passengers but the ship's still going down hmm okay in in Sweden they are predicting that there could be a real big swing to the right but at the same time the populist there is divided by men and women are you seeing that here as well the same I mean it says really wide divide it's a huge divide I mean I follow Sweden intently and you're gonna have whether the party there that's populist and anti-immigrant finishes first or second it'll be an amazing achievement that will destroy the ability of the governing alliances to govern without their consent but what we know is that law anti-immigrant populist parties attract man they attract them in Britain they attract them in Sweden they attract them in Italy and they attract them in the United States they tend to repel women hmm and that's what you're seeing oh and in another place in Sweden in other places is that women would like to have a they always across the world tend to lean a little bit to the left but when you're dominated by these sorts of passions they tend to lean more to the left and then you've got Donald Trump's issues with his past with regards to women which is particularly exacerbating that and you have a lot of Independence who are women who are not willing to give the Republican Party the time of day in the question of immigrants I mean when in a country the size of Sweden that that incredible influx of immigrants is going to be felt very hard we tend to absorb immigrants better both because of our philosophy and because of their size and yet it does seem to me that there is an elite you know they called it the steady state in that New York Times op-ed but it's this elite state that will not hear the people's concerns about this does that seem to you to be true or is that just an illusion thrown up by the fact that they can't make a decision that no one can make on I call them the ins I wrote a piece for unheard English website that I write for called the ins versus the outs and what you're finding across the world is that if you're educated and you're relatively affluent you tend to be less culturally conservative and you're coming together because you're defending your privilege and they don't view the rest of us very kindly they don't like average people they'd best they disdain them and at most they despise them and so consequently there are you know in the Sweden Democrats there used to be in the UH Nazi Party but 19% of the Swedes who are gonna vote for them are not near Nazis they're upset at immigration and the problem in Sweden is so large that they've had 400,000 people join their country as refugees in the last few years well given the size of their country that would be the same as if 13 million people showed up in the last three years here what do you think would happen if 13 million people came across the Canadian border you think would take it easily yeah yeah and I mean but it's yeah but but for the ends they're so insular and they dislike so much the assertion of popular sovereignty or popular government or Republican self-government that they'll drop for apatite's at the people who are concerned about this at the drop of a hat and that just makes more people angrier and angrier because they're not what they're being called so so let me return finally I know you have to go and I will get you out of here but I but let me return finally to the midterms your take now is that the standard idea is the GOP holds the Senate but probably loses the house how fluid is that I mean we're only now three through months out yeah two months out how fluid is that in your opinion well it's not fluid in the sense that there's gonna be a red wave you know that the president said back when he was campaigning for Troy Boulder stand outside of Columbus a month ago about the only way there would be a red wave as if we had something like and could you a Cuban Missile Crisis you know if we have in the North Korean missile crisis where we think we're gonna all die and then we have an agreement on October 27th then maybe that would reduce that but other than that we're just talking about magnitudes now if the president could get control of the news cycle in a way that favors him you know maybe the losses could be stemmed too you know where the Republicans could barely hold the house or barely lose the house maybe they'd gain a couple more seats in the Senate but people are pretty much made up their minds and it's only the margins that we're really talking about them okay then my last question how does that trickle down to local government I mean one of the things about Obama's he gutted the party to the State House level are we in danger of giving it back yeah very much so that you first of all anybody who is a Republican who is running in a seat that Hillary Clinton carried ought to have a good insurance policy because there's a good likelihood they're not coming back they're about there 7,500 roughly give or take a few hundred legislative seats in the country 500 of them are Republicans in Clinton Hill District and then you've got all the governorships you know when you've over the last decade Republicans have basically taken almost all of the blue and purple territory that they could win it's natural that they'd give some of that back and if this year is gonna be pro democratic the only question again is how many governorships fall on that and where they are it's a lot better for the Republican Party to lose the governorship of Maryland although it looks like Larry Hogan is to be fine then to lose the governorships of Wisconsin Michigan Ohio and Florida all of which are large states all of which have lots of seats that Republicans require in Congress when the redistricting comes up next time and right now Republicans are behind or running even in all of those four races Henry Olson one of the best comest political observers in the country right that American greatness his book is the working-class Republican Ronald Reagan and the return of blue-collar conservatism thanks a lot Henry I hope you come back as the midterms get closer love to have good love to come back thanks a lot thanks a lot always liked talking to him because he's like actually keeps level a level head I just want to talk one about one more thing before I go on to stuff I like which is what was happening in the questioning of Twitter and Facebook yesterday in Congress and this really interesting exchange that took place between Tom cotton and Jack Dorsey Dorsey came in and he said that yes conservatives had gotten nailed about on Twitter by an algorithm that affected them unfairly that they here's the description of Dorsey talking about that what did the algorithm take into account the led to prominent conservatives including members of the US House of Representatives not being included in Auto search suggestions we were using a signal of the behavior of the people following accounts and we didn't believe upon further consideration and also seeing the impact which was about 600,000 accounts so he later admitted this was unfair in other words if I come on and I make some comment about constitutional conservatism and a bunch of people get on ma and react to me with racist comments I get nailed because of the comments according to the old algorithm he is Dorsey has admitted that he is left and that his people skew left but to me the really telling moment was between Tom cotton and Dorsey when cotton asked this question this cut ate its Twitter American company we are an American company you prefer to see America remain the world's dominant global superpower I prefer that we continue to help everywhere we serve and we are pushing towards that but we need to be consistent about our Terms of Service know what that means I've gotten is asking him do you basically do you support America do you support American power do you support the American Way and Dorsey can't answer that because because while they are American companies and while they wouldn't exist if it weren't for America and while you couldn't build a business like that anywhere but America they are international platforms and they are their loyalties are not necessarily to the values here Google didn't even show up for these conferences I wanted to point that out because I also wanted to show one other clip of Alex Jones confronting Marco Rubio now Rubio and a lot of other members of Congress are very concerned about the Russians and other foreign powers use of social media I don't think they should be concerned about that at all because I don't see the difference between Russians coming on and pretending to be Americans and Americans I just don't see the difference we're all at each other's throats were all yelling at each other so some of the Russians who cares I don't think that's really a big deal but Rubio is upset about that and Alex Jones comes and starts screaming about the fact that he has been deep platformed I've said before I don't like Jones I think is really really unfair and dangerous as he's been to platform and listen to this exchange plan this joke over here that's why the platforming didn't work here's the question here's a question don't touch me I'm just bad you nice and I know but I don't want to be fed up I'm gonna get arrested who you are so I'm just gonna try to get around it man myself oh he'll beat me up I'd say they don't Miami be so bad you're not gonna stylish me you are like you are literally a little gangster thug there are people in this Rubio just threatened to physically take care of me woman tells you China the problem which it is but they're taking our free speech right now what a jerk I don't love that if real clock him but glad he didn't but I would have loved it you know all I want to say is that guys like this don't help our cause I mean it is hard it is hard to say like that guy need deserves a platform but he does he does deserve a platform I you know I wish Rubio to clock them they carried him out on his platform but no I mean when you silence him you give him more power and that is what you're seeing in Sweden - when you make when you make an opinion so you know who Trey when you say your opinion is so unacceptable that you can't even express it you give people power you don't take it away the New York Times is celebrating the fact that Alex Jones is losing his following he's not losing its following it's going underground it's getting more frustrated it'll get more powerful and will come back with a vengeance let him speak let him speak we will take them down right here America is well able to take down all those forms of voices if we can speak if the Supreme Court stops making law if unelected anonymous New York Times guy stops running the government or pretending to run the government if they just let the people speak they will run the government according to the Constitution and we will be fine I mean this is really it is really it really is the difference between the two sides is that you know we want to argue they want silence and to rule we want to pass laws win or lose they want to impose Fiats from the Supreme Court we want to be governed by the Constitution they want to be governed by whatever hysteria makes you forget your rights we want America you know we want America they want crazytown all right stuff I like the fire caused a fire stuff on I cost of my life all right Marv will be Aegon's they're still coming in it still a chance to get to be the official stuff I like theme song I am as you rob is completely lost it here it is I I am as you know a big fan of hard-boiled fiction of movies and books and TV shows and sometimes they call it noir after the French the darkness you know the black fiction and the thing is that Nora's like jazz it is really an American invention that Americans have never really liked all that much I mean jazz you know when you say jazz everybody thinks ah yeah the popular jazz has never been that popular neither is film noir neither of tough-guy writers and there are a lot of really good tough-guy writers who never get noticed I want to mention one of them who is a pal of mine but I that's not why I mention him I mentioned because I haven't seen him in a long time and I was in a used bookstore and I picked up a book of his I had not read before and it was reminded me of just how terrific he is Jason's star is it's st ARR is by no means one of the most famous writers in the country but you probably if you like comic books you've read him he's he's written some I think Wolverine he's written and a couple of others and he is he's won some awards and been nominated for awards for his tough-guy writing but he writes this stuff that is just as dark as you can imagine and his characters are almost all of them like kind of psychopathic guys who just pushed the line they just go over the line he's in the tradition I would say of James M Cain that is who he's in the tradition of the book that I discovered it was called fake ID it's one of these series of books called the hard case crime books which are absolutely terrific it's an absolutely terrific series especially terrific for its for its covers the covers of the heart case crime books are great but fake ID is about a bouncer or wannabe actor he dreams of owning his own horse and you know it's just about the way he kind of pushes his dreams forward even as diseases descending into this kind of hellish world it has one of the great last lines I just really enjoyed it I picked it up at a used bookstore and I must have read it in a couple of hours I mean it's just really good Jason Starr worth discovering Jason STAAR are I'm pretty sure he must be a left-winger so he'll love having all you Trump smoking crazy people descend on his books but really worth reading if you like hard-boiled fiction a really good writer that's it you guys are you're screwed I mean the Clavin this weekend is here I hope you have sucked all the Clavin tea goodness you can get out of this show and keep it
