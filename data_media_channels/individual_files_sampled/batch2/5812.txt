if you could hear the conversation in the brain closing her namesake fashion company turn her focus to long-term policymaking she says Ivanka stepped away from the company's management and operations in 2017 to avoid potential ethics violations but had retained her ownership through a trust the first daughter plans to continue filing trademark applications on her name after the company is shuttered despite soaring sales leading up to the 2016 presidential election the brain became a lightning rod for critics of her father's policies facing boycotts deteriorating sales and being dropped from major retailers like Nordstrom Neiman Marcus and Hudson's Bay let's bring in ms NBC's Stephanie ruhle she's got her show come up in 26 minutes but she came in to early for us Steph what more can you tell us about this so to say Ivanka's business was failing and that's why she shut it down is a bridge too far you saw companies in metropolitan areas stores stopped carrying her stuff but then you also saw a lot of stores in the southeast pick them up one of the things that she faced it was a problem they couldn't expand internationally it wasn't an option for them now we could criticize her all day long saying well why is she doing it look at it cynically or I'm gonna say at the very least take this at face value every day we hammer Ivanka Trump you have a conflict of interest you run a business you're the only one who owns the business it makes no sense she's shutting it down we should take it and move on is it not the case there's some there's some controversy over some connection between her businesses and China and some of the actions that President Trump has taken there without a doubt there definitely is and and there's issues around she sat next to Xi Jinping at mar-a-lago this same night she got 13 new trademarks absolutely there are issues around it and we can continue to ask but there are bigger issues that are a threat to the American people we hammer her constantly and say I cannot believe you still have your company now she doesn't and now maybe we can say to her great Ivanka you're in the White House full-time I'm pretty sure you were focused on the advancement of women and girls how about reunification of those kids well she said she's gonna do long-term policymaking because she said so much success at it so far right now she feels like she does she takes credit and if you talk to other people who actually worked on tax reform they don't that up but she likes to say she was involved in tax policies she's working on parental leave and she was the one who sort of chaired this workforce development effort now we still don't know where these workforce programs are coming from or where they're getting paid but she feels like she's getting bipartisan support my takeaway is if you thought Jared navantia were coming back to New York in September they're not though they're to stay to your point we said that the day that the family reunification story broke the separation story broke she should be on a plane down to the border that day actually was Melania who got on a plane and made a couple of visits do you think Ivanka will step into that I mean she has a little to some extent but not of the only thing we heard from her on this when the president signed the executive order to reverse his own zero-tolerance policy she thanked and congratulated him right and so now it's Congress's term well excuse me miss Trump absolutely not there are families there are parents that have now been deported they are not eligible to come back and we have those children here so even if you made that you said this is not a humanitarian or heartstrings issue make it a policy of fiscal issue we're not going to have those adults who would be here contributing to our economy and potentially paying taxes but instead we now have those children without their families and we have to house them clothe them feed them and give them an education none of it makes sense from a policy perspective and if she says she's somebody who wants to focus on policy and women and girls be my guest made it are you saying that a bunker Trump now has no conflicts of interest no government job absolutely not remember she is still a key person in the Trump Organization Ivanka was the one who led the project for the hotel in Washington DC she and Jared has made tens of millions of dollars so to say she's conflict-free is an out is nonsense but as far as her business her namesake brand goes she shut it down let's take it all right we want your business brand in the story as well the president's been talking trade this morning firing off several tweets on the matter he writes every time I see a weak politician asking to stop trade talks or the use of tariffs to counter unfair tariffs I wonder what can they be thinking are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off lost eight hundred seventeen billion on trade last year no weakness he can continued when you have people snipping at your heels he writes during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity negotiations are going really well be cool the end result will be worth it he concluded China is targeting our farmers who they know I love and respect as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the u.s. they are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt we were being nice until now China made 517 billion dollars on us last year okay well so that I say mr. Trump when you say he wonders what are they thinking every business person every political leader every political historian and any economist I speak to says what are you thinking and we have to remember during the campaign when Jared Kushner was tasked with finding an economic adviser whose views mirrored those of the president he found Peter Navarro who by any credible economist standards is considered a wackadoo in an Amazon search and so Stephanie you had even his chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow who you know well in March of this year was on TV was writing op-eds railing against tariffs saying tariffs are taxes there's never a happy ending to a tariff story now he's sitting at the right hand of the president what must he be thinking he's on CBS this morning rolling the media that the president needs him to saying president Trump didn't cause this problem he inherited it he's right that we have a trade issue with places like China when you're talking about intellectual property and that's why you engage in in in in treaties like TPP or TPP TPP IP with Europe what the president is doing now is pure nonsense and when he's spreading around saying I'm going to help the farmers using a depression-era tactic at a time when he claims our economy is the greatest era well what's gonna happen when fishermen say well this is affecting the seafood industry oil and gas manufacturing today GM said they've lost a billion dollars because commodity prices are up you know commodities are steel and aluminum that's huge cash just to simpler questions just for anybody who's always reading these tweets when he talks about the Ada and seventeen billion dollars that we lost on trade first of all I know if I ask you did we lose 870 million dollars or trade you'll say it's absurd put that aside what is that either in 17 billion is that what does that number even attach to and a budget deficit are two different things when the president blames all of this on the Chinese government on the other side is the US consumer and the US consumer made a decision years ago that we love cheap stuff and we want it now that's how Walmart and Amazon became the most powerful companies out there but even a budget deficit it would if the parallel was a budget episode would mean we were losing 800,000 to ourselves makes no sense but what does that 817 billion what is that number he's we know this number out I don't know it's not even a question I don't know where he's getting that specific number from but the numbers don't make sense and when he throws this at the American people or his base they start to say well look we're getting ripped off not in that regard okay is the president rattled is he off his game I can't say he has advisers who know that the United States has tariffs of its own that the United States subsidizes some industries in a way that other countries believe is tantamount to it to a tariff or an unfair tax on their products he knows or they know that those bmws he complains about those SUVs are made in South Carolina can they not tell him these things or does he refuse to believe these things they can and when those and those who realize they cannot change the president's mind eventually leave the building remember specifically when Gary cone left the administration it was days after Trump surprisingly announced that meeting with steel and aluminum CEOs when Wilbur Oz and Peter Navarro snuck their way into the White House off the schedule the day we knew hope Hicks was leaving that's when people like Gary Cohen said I cannot do any good here this guy can't see straight Steph you have 17 minutes before you sure you have to get ready wait you don't think this is know that's already talked about that's always ready always Stephanie ruhle thank you very much we'll see in a minute coming up the president is reacting on Twitter to that newly released recording where he discusses a payment involving a former Playboy model just now tweeting suggesting there are more tapes including conversations with reporters we will talk about that next but first so to be clear mr. Trump has no financial relationships with any Russian oligarchs that's what he said and that's what I said that's obviously our position is that was Paul manna for two years ago this Friday responding to questions about Donald Trump in Russia the president's former campaign chairman soon will be going to trial and that's only part of the legal web and snaring the president's team will talk about that next on Morning Joe thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
