1
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:03,784
HE MADE US REALIZE IF YOU HAVE A

2
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:04,818
HELPING HAND, YOU WILL FIND ONE

3
00:00:04,818 --> 00:00:06,820
AT THE END OF YOUR ARM.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,889
>> JOINING ME NOW IS THE BRITISH

5
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:09,857
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. AND WE'RE

6
00:00:09,857 --> 00:00:12,793
HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY.

7
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:14,127
WE'LL CERTAINLY TALK ABOUT THE

8
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:17,497
ROYAL WEDDING AS SHEP SMITH

9
00:00:17,497 --> 00:00:17,831
TEASED.

10
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:18,699
I WANT TO START WITH THE NEWS.

11
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:20,400
THAT ASSAD HAS TRAVELED TO

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:20,734
RUSSIA.

13
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:21,969
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

14
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:23,904
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO FIRST ASK

15
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:25,472
WHY PRESIDENT PUTIN THINKS IT'S

16
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:26,707
A GOOD IDEA TO HOST SOMEONE WHO

17
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:29,710
HAS GASSED HIS OWN PEOPLE, WHO

18
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,213
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH HUGE

19
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:34,314
DISPLACEMENT, HALF MILLION

20
00:00:34,314 --> 00:00:35,315
SYRIANS DEAD AS A RESULT OF THE

21
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:35,782
CIVIL WAR.

22
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:36,750
EXTRAORDINARY THING TO DO.

23
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,719
>> Dana: IT WAS JUST THIS WEEK

24
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,220
THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY

25
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,788
WAS VERY CLEAR WITH THE RUSSIANS

26
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:44,091
ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN YOUR

27
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:47,261
OWN COUNTRY TO RUSSIAN NATIONALS

28
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:49,496
THAT WERE LIVING THERE.

29
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:50,898
>> YES, THERE'S A TRACK RECORD

30
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:52,532
HERE OF RUSSIANS ACTUALLY USING

31
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:55,535
NERVE AGENTS AGAINST PEOPLE ON

32
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:58,772
FOREIGN SOIL AND VERY STRONG

33
00:00:58,772 --> 00:01:04,111
INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO THAT

34
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:06,013
MESSAGE HASN'T GOTTEN THROUGH

35
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:07,414
WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DONE.

36
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:08,115
>> Dana: CERTAINLY THE UNITED

37
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:09,283
STATES AND THE U.K. HAVE A

38
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:10,317
SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP.

39
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:11,652
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S NOT WITHOUT

40
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:11,985
TENSION.

41
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:16,390
AND OBVIOUSLY, IET  -- THE IRAN

42
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,958
DEAL IS ONE OF THOSE.

43
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,193
WHERE DO THINGS GO HERE?

44
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:21,595
>> IT'S ONE OF A CLOSE

45
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:22,029
RELATIONSHIP.

46
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:22,896
ONE OF THE ASPECTS IS WHEN YOU

47
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:24,064
HAVE DISAGREEMENTS YOU CAN

48
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:25,032
DISCUSS THEM OPENLY AND FRANKLY

49
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:27,768
AND TRY TO FIND A WAY FORWARD.

50
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:30,938
WE WOULD LIKE TO RETAIN THE

51
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:32,339
JCPOA OR THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL

52
00:01:32,339 --> 00:01:34,474
PROVIDED THAT THE IRANIANS STAY

53
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:35,275
IN COMPLIANCE.

54
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:36,410
THE PRIME MINISTER MET THE

55
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,112
GERMAN CHANCELLOR AND THE FRENCH

56
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:39,713
PRESIDENT YESTERDAY.

57
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:41,014
AND THAT'S THEIR POSITION, TOO,

58
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:41,815
AND THAT WAS THE SUBSTANCE OF

59
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:47,287
THE JOINT STATEMENT.

60
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:48,422
THE DISAGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED

61
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:49,856
STATES NOT ABOUT OBJECTIVES

62
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:52,459
BECAUSE WE ALL SHARE THE SAME

63
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:53,360
OBJECTIVES BUT ABOUT MEETINGS

64
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,628
AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

65
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:56,797
CONCERN THE UNITED STATES LIKE

66
00:01:56,797 --> 00:01:58,231
THE BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM OR

67
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,766
IRAN'S REGIONAL ACTIVITIES IN

68
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:03,270
LEBANON AND SYRIA, IN YEMEN,

69
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,806
ABSOLUTELY SHARE THESE CONCERNS

70
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:07,507
SO WE WANT TO WORK ON THOSE, ON

71
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:08,308
ADDRESSING THOSE WHILE KEEPING

72
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,043
THE JCPOA, MAYBE WE CAN WORK

73
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:11,378
WITH THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION ON

74
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:13,246
THOSE AREAS NOW.

75
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:14,081
>> Dana: DO YOU THINK IT'S

76
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:15,649
POSSIBLE THAT THE U.K. AND

77
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:17,150
OTHERS WOULD HELP THE UNITED

78
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,218
STATES IN TIGHTENING SANCTIONS

79
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:18,952
AGAINST IRAN?

80
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:20,821
>> I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION FOR

81
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:22,622
THE FUTURE AND WE HAVE TO SEE,

82
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:27,661
FIRST OF ALL, HOW THE SANCTIONS

83
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:27,995
UNFOLDS.

84
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:28,795
I SHOULD BE CLEAR IN SAYING THAT

85
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:31,498
WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE DEAL, WE

86
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:36,303
ARE NOT -- NOT THE U.K., NOT OUR

87
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:38,772
EUROPEAN PARTNERS WE IMPOSE

88
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:39,673
SANCTIONS IRAN.

89
00:02:39,673 --> 00:02:41,675
WE'RE INTENDING TO KEEP TO THE

90
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:44,111
DEAL WHICH IS MEANT TO STOP THE

91
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:46,747
IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM BUT ALSO

92
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:47,814
TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE

93
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:50,083
SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN.

94
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,952
>> Dana: IS ANY OF THAT GOING TO

95
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:52,786
COLOR THE DISCUSSIONS ON TRADE

96
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:54,087
THAT THE EUROPEANS ARE HAVING

97
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:54,688
WITH THE UNITED STATES?

98
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:55,822
NOT JUST CHINA AND NAFTA BUT

99
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:56,890
THERE'S THIS ISSUE GOING IN

100
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,891
FRONT OF THE E.U.?

101
00:02:57,891 --> 00:02:59,893
>> YEAH, WE HOPE NOT.

102
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:02,062
WE HAVE AN EXEMPTION AS THE

103
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:04,898
EUROPEAN UNION ON THE MEASURES

104
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:06,767
ON STEEL I THINK UNTIL THE END

105
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:07,734
OF THIS MONTH.

106
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:08,402
WE WOULD LIKE A PERMANENT

107
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:09,770
EXTENSION.

108
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,271
WE ARE TALKING TO THE

109
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:13,306
ADMINISTRATION NOW.

110
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:16,076
TALKING TO THE ADMINISTRATION

111
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:17,577
ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO GRANT

112
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:18,945
THAT PERMANENT EXTENSION.

113
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:22,215
WE HOPE WE CAN FIND A WAY

114
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:22,549
FORWARD.

115
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:25,552
I MEAN, THE -- THESE MOVES --

116
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:28,655
THIS DISPUTE IS BASED ON

117
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:31,491
NATIONAL SECURITY AND WE'RE VERY

118
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:32,626
STRONG NATIONAL SECURITY

119
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:33,360
PARTNERS OF THE U.S.

120
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,729
SO IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO ASK

121
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:36,930
THAT THIS SHOULD BE DIRECTED

122
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,664
AGAINST THE U.K.

123
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:39,232
>> Dana: IN THE MEANTIME, YOU

124
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:39,900
HAVE SOME EXCITING NEWS

125
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,736
HAPPENING OVER IN THE U.K.

126
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:43,770
SHEPHERD SMITH IS THERE FOR THE

127
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,237
ROYAL WEDDING.

128
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:46,273
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT AMERICANS

129
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:48,408
ARE SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS

130
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:49,443
NUPTIALS ON SATURDAY?

131
00:03:49,443 --> 00:03:50,510
>> I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.

132
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,346
BEFORE YOU COME HERE, YOU HEAR

133
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:56,249
HOW FASCINATED AND ENTHUSIASTIC

134
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:57,851
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ABOUT

135
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:58,685
OUR ROYAL FAMILY.

136
00:03:58,685 --> 00:03:59,386
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE HERE TO

137
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:02,522
EXPERIENCE IT.

138
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:05,292
AND THERE'S EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL

139
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,360
OF INTEREST AND ENTHUSIASM.

140
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,195
THERE'S, OF COURSE, SOMETHING

141
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:09,963
SPECIAL ABOUT THIS ONE WHICH IS

142
00:04:09,963 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT PRINCE HARRY WHO IS A MUCH
