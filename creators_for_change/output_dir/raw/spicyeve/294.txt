12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,050
hair out on camera I've been trying out

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">some new products and to co wash my hair</font>

14
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,460
up just now I used be l5t therapy

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,320
clarifying conditioner vanilla mint tea

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,530
now usually I just use the conditioner I

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,739
have on hand which right now is awesome

18
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,220
moist sometimes herbal essences the

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,170
thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these conditioners is that</font>

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,960
they're so good and so thick and so rich

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,930
and very conditioning that not only do I

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,659
not feel my hair it's clean it's like

23
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,290
it's too<font color="#E5E5E5"> soft it's over conditioned if</font>

24
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,470
that makes any sense so I thought I'd

25
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">try and vo 5s clarifying conditioners um</font>

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time I've tried aveo5 product</font>

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,130
was when I was transitioning and I tried

28
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,229
the clarified conditioner in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lime</font>

29
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,689
and I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried in like a year of</font>

30
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">app so I'm decided to give it another go</font>

31
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,460
so far they like it just because it's

32
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,439
not it's so light and that's what I

33
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,090
thought the problem was with these

34
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,250
conditioners but right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using it</font>

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,009
to my advantage because it's so light

36
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,049
that it I feel like it's cleaning my

37
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,820
hair it's not over conditioning my hair

38
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,040
you know I'm saying when I rinse it out

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,799
my hair is still soft but I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a</font>

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,780
conditioner afterwards you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I</font>

41
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,770
mean whereas if I co washed with um

42
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,200
awesome moist the idea of putting a

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,530
conditioner on afterwards is weird right

44
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,849
so my hair feels clean but it feels soft

45
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:15,680
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets the job done it kind of just</font>

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,629
kind of smells like boy um but whatever

47
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:22,430
my hair was divided into the five

48
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,739
sections of my old dusty braid out and

49
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:26,569
so then I co washing those five sections

50
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:30,530
right so then afterwards I applied my

51
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,620
trusted kinky curly not today on those

52
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,890
five sections my hair was kind of

53
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,299
dripping wet it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really dripping</font>

54
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:41,360

60
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,849
