a Tennessee woman was shamed away from the apartments pool because one woman claimed that her outfit or her bathing suit was too seductive and would excite teenage boys so Tory Jenkins is the woman who was confronted about her bathing suit and we are about to show you these images when she wore the kids up but make sure that your teenage boys are not watching because if they do get a stiffy well you know the world will come to an end now uh here's her outfit I mean it's she's wearing a one-piece and to be quite honest with you I mean I've been to Miami I've seen what you know scantily clad is this is not it she's wearing a perfectly fine bathing suit Tubbs woman what are the t-shirt do they really yeah they to whom ma'am give a damn all right so there she is Tory Jenkins keep in mind this is the apartment building that she is living in this story started to gain traction because her fiance wrote about it on his Facebook page and that post went viral and an interesting component of that post included the $300 that Tory Jenkins had paid to maintain the pool that she was essentially shamed out of using because her one-piece was too seductive for teenage boys according to one woman now she complained about it right she went to the management for the apartment building and and brought up the issue and guess what they doubled down and they said and maybe you should wear a towel around your body when you're walking around the pool oh I got an idea what is it why don't they make her wear bikini but that's the thing I like the bikini point is such a good one because it shows you that you cannot win in America if you're a woman if you're considered scantily clad well you're a slut and these you know these teenage boys can't contain themselves so you got to go you got to go if you wear a bikini you get judged for that suit so like what what can we do what can we wear that won't and some Rando at the pool who's much too concerned with what everyone else is wearing as opposed to I don't know maybe disciplining your kids if you really think that your teenage boys can't help themselves and can't behave because they see a woman wearing a one-piece so by the way the boys didn't do anything here it's just the mom assuming that her like and what a wonderfully awkward conversation you go to the management of the apartment lessee I believe that my kids are going to masturbate over this woman over there so can you do something about it because my teenage boys might have erections but let me be clear let me be clear about something um the woman in question who confronted torie Jenkins did not go to the management the individual who did go to management was Tori Jenkins because she was upset at the way that she was treated at the pool which by the way she helped pay to maintain right and so the management for the apartment decided to double down on what that woman had said to her and so well it's just anyway um let me give you a quote from Jenkins herself she says she basically told me that if I didn't have kids I wouldn't understand if her kids were at the pool she wouldn't want me in that swimsuit how inappropriate I looked and now I of course realize one more thing it might not be her kids she's worried about it might be her husband I'm not saying a little bit of speculation so if I was to hankins and somebody asked me to leave because of that I'd be like that's like your opinion man now a hashtag suck it because I have every right to be in this fool just as much as you do so go ahead and piss off I know I would take it further and the way that I would take it further is I would go back inside my apartment I would find some pasties and then I would find a g-string and I would go back out to the pool and I would perform salsa around the pool premises every every guy is going to complain about Anna's outfit at a pool like no no oh don't don't get the pasties don't get them okay that's what I would do oh you don't like that all right well then why don't you take your ass back to your apartment like you don't have to use a pool and needs me here apparently theoretically horny teenage kids okay one last thing go break the graphic 18 because I want to give Tori Kangas one more prop here anybody noticed the fun alien she has a tattoo there on her side I didn't notice but I didn't acknowledge it yeah it is one okay yeah well you know a little bit of I'm just having fun she's got an alien on her she's a young woman she just wants to go out and have a swim enjoy the Sun enjoy the pool that she paid to help maintain what do you get for Young Turks membership it's a mystery only one way to find out TYT Network comm /join
