The original place to invest online. IF WE WANT TO KNOW WHO LEAK THE SPECIAL COUNSEL' LONG LIST OF QUESTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT, WE NEED TO ASK WHO STANDS THE MOST TO GAIN? THE FORMER ASSISTANT TO BOB MUELLER BLAMED PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE LEAK BUT TRUMP BLASTED THE LEAK HIMSELF IN A TWEET EARLIER TODAY. A REPORT IN THE WASHINGTON POST SUGGESTED THE LEAKED LIST MAYBE A SERIES OF REQUESTS COMBINED BY A TRUMP ATTORNEY. IT MAY HAVE BEEN A LIST OF QUESTIONS THE PRESIDENT'S LEGAL TEAM BELIEVED TRUMP WOULD BE ASKED, KIND OF A MOOT COURT SITUATION. LET'S ASK TWO TOP LEGAL MINDS WHY THEY THINK THE LIST WAS LEAKED. FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND FORMER WHITEWATER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL. THE INTRIGUE, JOE, ABOUT WHO LEAKED WHAT. WHO HAS MOTIVE. LIKE COLUMBO. I ACTUALLY DON'T CARE. I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THESE ARE CLEARLY THE TYPE OF QUESTIONS DISCUSSED BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM AND MR. MUELLER, AND THE QUESTION, WHAT DO THESE QUESTIONS SAY? THEY SAY THE INVESTIGATION IS NOW LURCHING INTO TERRITORY PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTION, THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGES OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND MUELLER, LET'S ASSUME THE QUESTIONS ARE ACCURATE THAT. THIS IS WHAT MUELLER WANTS TO ASK. IF THEY ARE, AND IF HE INSISTS ON ANSWERS, AND WILL NOT ACCEPT A WRITTEN ANSWER AND DEMANDS AN INTERVIEW, WHICH THE PRESIDENT REJECTS, AND THEN MUELLER INSISTS ON A SPEEN , WE'RE HEAD TODAY A SUBPOENA, WE'RE HEAD TODAY A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT WON'T ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS UNDER ANY SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. WHEN I SAW TONIGHT THIS REPORT IN THE POST ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL SUBPOENA, YOU KNOW IT TAKES KIND OF A LOT TO SHOCK ME THESE DAYS IN WASHINGTON BUT I TOOK A COUPLE EXTRA BREATHS THERE. YOUR REACTION. I'M NOT SURE. I SAW THE, I'M NOT SURE I SAW THE POSTING. IS IT ALREADY ISSUED? NO APPARENTLY MUELLER RAISED THE POSSIBILITY WITH THE TRUMP LEGAL TEAM REPORTEDLY. I THINK JOE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IF, IF PRESIDENT TRUMP DECIDES NOT TO SIT IN FOR THE INTERVIEW AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS, AND THESE ARE VERY BROAD QUESTIONS THAT DEFINITELY RAISE ISSUES OF BOTH EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND SEPARATION OF POWERS, IF HE DECLINES TO ANSWER AND MUELLER ISSUES A SUBPOENA, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST A QUESTION OF DOES TRUMP INVOKE THE FIFTH OR GO TO THE GRAND JIRX HE'LL GO AND LITIGATE THIS ISSUE AND HERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY INTERESTING THAT I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY HAS TALKED ABOUT. REMEMBER, IN THE WATERGATE YEARS, YOU HAD U.S. VERSUS NIXON WHERE THE SUPREME COURT REJECTED PRESIDENT NIXON'S BLANKET CLAIMS OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, BUT IN THAT DECISION, THEY POINTED OUT THAT LEON JAWORSKI, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL, HAD BEEN EXPLICITLY GRANTED THE POWER TO CON SEX EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. I'M NOT SURE BOB MUELLER HAS THE POWER UNDER HIS APPOINTMENT FROM ROSENSTEIN OR THE REGULATION TO GO IN AND CHALLENGE THE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE SO THERE'S A POSSIBLE THIRD WAY FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BOTTLE THIS UP IN COURT ON THE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE ISSUE. VERY INTERESTING. I LOVE THAT. ANY PARTICULAR QUESTIONS IN THE LONG LIST JUMPED OUT AT YOU AND WHY. YES, THE QUESTION POLLSED BY MUELLER ABOUT WHAT WERE YOU THINKING WHEN YOU FIRED COMEY? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING WHEN YOU FIRED FLYNN? THE NOTION THAT A SPECIAL COUNSEL CAN INTRUDE ON THE THINKING PROCESS OF A SITTING PRESIDENT, WHILE HE WAS PRESIDENT, FIRING A PERSON THAT YOU HAVE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY, UNFETTERED, UNREVIEW ABLE AUTHORITY TO FIRE UNTHE CONSTITUTION TELLS ME ONE THING ABOUT MUELLER. HE HAS GONE GOOFY.
