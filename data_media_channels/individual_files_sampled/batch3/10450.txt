the US president Donald Trump says he doubts talks with North Korea could lead to anything meaningful adding that his predecessors also failed in such attempts but his comments came after North and South Korea agreed to go to the Olympics under a unified flag in a breakthrough deal following direct talks between the two countries RT correspondent caleb Maupin has more on what Trump has said now in his latest interview I'm not sure that talks will lead to anything meaningful they've talked for 25 years and they've taken advantage of our presidents of our previous presidents you listen to Trump's words you would think that the dialogue currently taking place between the north and the south was irrelevant that nothing was happening but it looks like some historic breakthroughs have actually taken place this is what was recently announced good the north and south will march together in the opening ceremony under the Korean Peninsula flag and form a single north-south female ice hockey team so here we have upcoming a joint women's ice hockey team that will be playing in the Olympic Games competing under a unified Korean flag this is this is a huge breakthrough we also have 230 North Koreans who are actually coming to the Olympics to cheer and observe the games so there are some big breakthroughs going on but Trump does not think they are significant Trump did not only criticize North Korea he's also called out China saying that he praised their efforts but he wished that they would do more and he said that Russia wasn't helping at all now Russia was a signatory to the recent sanctions on North Korea and they've stated over and over again that they have not at any point breached those sanctions that they signed on to now with all of this with his criticism not just of North Korea but also of Russia and of China Donald Trump seemed to be emphasizing that he believed that his approach in which the the North Koreans were met with more isolation more economic sanctions more threats and more of a punitive approach he believed that that approach was the best way to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula intensifying pressure on North Korea was also the key agenda of a meeting in Canada between the Western allies of the 1950 Korean War but the gathering ignored the fact that North and South were already holding direct talks and the Vancouver meeting also failed to invite key regional players that of Russia and China analysts we spoke to believe Washington fears a lesser role in this crisis President Trump somehow believes that this pressure approach is the is something different than that has been applied before which it isn't and in reality he wants to pull back some of the Thunder if you will back to Washington because you have again the north and south talking I think the u.s. is a little Jekyll and Hyde with its policies because on one hand it wants to have a resolution wants to have D nuclearization wants to have peace and on the other hand pumps up this rhetoric and so the motivations relate to finances they relate to geopolitical factors of the u.s. power in the region if you will and they relate to trying to ice out China and Russia a little bit as a player in this as was evident in Vancouver the u.s. is constantly menacing North Korea and constantly threatening North Korea carrying out war exercises that simulate the destruction of North Korea our country that was destroyed by the United States between 1950 and 53 four to five million Koreans died there wasn't one structure taller than one story still standing as a consequence of u.s. bombers and the main complaint of American pilots was there was nothing left to bomb in that war so it the u.s. annihilated North Korea here we have Donald Trump saying he's promising to do the same from the road from the podium of the UN just a couple months ago and now Trump were reflecting I think not just his own personal position but that of the military-industrial complex in America fears that peace may be breaking out in the Korean Peninsula between the two Koreas that's alarming to Trump into the military industrial complex but very welcomed by all the people in the world
