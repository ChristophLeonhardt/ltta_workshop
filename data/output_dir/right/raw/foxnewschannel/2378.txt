1
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:12,591
>> RIGHT NOW IN SYRIA, WE ARE IN

2
00:00:12,591 --> 00:00:15,494
THE MOST AGGRESSIVE ENVIRONMENT

3
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:16,862
ON THE PLANET FROM OUR

4
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:18,097
ADVERSARIES WERE TESTING US

5
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:21,100
EVERY DAY, KNOCKING DOWN OUR

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,868
COMMUNICATIONS.

7
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:24,437
>> Martha: THAT IS ALARMING

8
00:00:24,437 --> 00:00:26,405
AND THAT CAME FROM THE HEAD OF

9
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:30,876
U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS SAYING

10
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:32,278
ELECTRONIC WHILE WARFARE IS NOW

11
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:34,313
ONE OF THE MILITARY'S BIGGEST

12
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:37,483
PROBLEMS IN SYRIA.

13
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:39,285
OUR ENEMIES ARE ABLE TO DISABLE

14
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:41,187
AMERICAN PLANES THAT ARE

15
00:00:41,187 --> 00:00:43,489
PROVIDING AIR SUPPORT TO U.S.

16
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:44,223
COMMANDERS ON THE GROUND HERE

17
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:49,695
THAT IS NOT A GOOD SITUATION.

18
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:51,030
THEY ARE JAMMING THE U.S. DRONES

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,464
IN THE REGION.

20
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:54,467
JOHNNY MONELL, REBECCA GRAHAM

21
00:00:57,636 --> 00:01:00,740
REBECCA, WELCOME BACK.

22
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,408
THAT'S DISTURBING TO READ LET'S

23
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:04,777
PUT UP THE PICTURE AGAIN OF THE

24
00:01:04,777 --> 00:01:06,846
AC 1:30.

25
00:01:06,846 --> 00:01:11,117
THEY ARE ABLE TO JAM THE AC 130.

26
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:12,251
WHAT ARE THESE DOING QUESTION

27
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:16,622
MIKE WHAT ARE THEY FOR US?

28
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:20,026
>> IT'S A HIGHLY CAPABLE

29
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:20,659
GUNSHIP, BUT IT PROVIDES

30
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:21,060
GUNFIRE.

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,897
THE RUSSIANS ARE TRYING TO

32
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:26,599
INTERFERE WITH THE HF AND UHF

33
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,299
RADIO FREQUENCIES.

34
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,401
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE BEING AS

35
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:29,635
EFFECTIVE AS THEY WOULD LIKE TO

36
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:37,009
BE, BUT THIS IS ALL PUTIN.

37
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:38,878
THEY HAVE BROUGHT ALL OF THAT TO

38
00:01:38,878 --> 00:01:41,647
SYRIA TO TEST OUT OUR U.S.-LED

39
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:42,448
COALITION AND OUR PARTNERS.

40
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:43,783
>> Martha: HOW DO WE FIGHT

41
00:01:43,783 --> 00:01:46,118
BACK AGAINST THAT?

42
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:49,155
>> FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS NOT

43
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:50,923
GOING TO STOP THE ANTI-ISIS

44
00:01:50,923 --> 00:01:51,524
PUBLIC OPERATIONS.

45
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:54,727
WHAT WHAT WE NEED HERE, THEY'VE

46
00:01:54,727 --> 00:01:55,494
GOT SOME WONDERFUL RADIOS.

47
00:01:55,494 --> 00:02:02,868
WHAT WE HAVE IS THE ABILITY TO

48
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:03,836
REBUILD AND REFORM THESE

49
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:08,874
NETWORKS BECAUSE THE COALITION

50
00:02:08,874 --> 00:02:09,508
CONNECTS WITH RADIOS AND

51
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,045
DIFFERENT DEVICES.

52
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:15,981
WITH A NEED TO DO IS ACCELERATE

53
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:21,120
THE FUELING.

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,121
THE STRATEGY CALLS FOR US TO

55
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:27,693
COUNTER THIS.

56
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:28,961
>> Martha: THIS IS WHAT WE'RE

57
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:31,063
DOING NEXT IN SYRIA.

58
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:33,132
WATCH.

59
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:34,400
>> WE HAVE FINISHED THE FIGHT.

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,403
>> RIGHT NOW, WE ARE NOT

61
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:40,206
WITHDRAWING.

62
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:45,177
YOU'LL SEE IT'S A REENERGIZED

63
00:02:45,177 --> 00:02:51,317
EFFORT.

64
00:02:51,317 --> 00:02:53,452
THIS IS AN ONGOING FIGHT RIGHT

65
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:56,455
NOW.

66
00:02:56,455 --> 00:02:59,425
>> IT'S A RISKY PROPOSITION.

67
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:03,262
>> I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE WOULD

68
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:06,699
PROBABLY REGRET IT.

69
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:08,901
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU MAKE

70
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:09,201
THAT?

71
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:11,270
>> WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT ON

72
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,539
THE GROUND HELPING OUR PARTNERS,

73
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:14,306
ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHEAST

74
00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:14,640
CORNER.

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,645
THAT IS 100% RIGHT.

76
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:21,647
WE NEED TO HAVE MORE

77
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:23,616
STABILIZATION SO THEY CAN GO ON

78
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:23,916
THERE.

79
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,718
THAT'S WHY THE RUSSIAN ACTIVITY

80
00:03:25,718 --> 00:00:00,000
IS SO DANGEROUS, BUT MAKE NO
