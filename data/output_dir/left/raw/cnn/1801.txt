00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
California's Democratic Governor Jerry
Brown Governor Brown thanks so much for

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,730
joining us appreciate it
okay thank you glad to be here so

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,400
yesterday you suggested president
Trump's approach to North Korea was

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,030
quote stupid and dangerous and silly I
know you don't care for the term rocket

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,560
man about Kim jong-un but to play
devil's advocate is it not possible that

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,550
this tactic might work because
everything else has failed with North

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,930
Korea from Clinton to Bush to Obama who
tried at the diplomatic way yeah if you

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,000
believe in bluster and starting a
bluster war with North Korea which is

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,579
what they do and they're pretty darn
good at invective and threats one after

10
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,559
the other so I think bluster is not the
pathway of diplomacy or even

11
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,579
statesmanship sure these are real
serious issues no doubt about it I've

12
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,570
got to work closely with China and
Russia and South Korea and Japan but

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,910
just noise and threats we're going to
kill every man woman and she'll a child

14
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,190
in North Korea is that that doesn't
advance the ball it just raises the the

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,670
temperature and the exchange of
non-rational bluster back and forth I

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,060
don't think that's positive speaking of
raising the temperature you're at the UN

17
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,240
General Assembly with other Democratic
governors to participate in climate week

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,810
President Trump we're told aired his
dissatisfaction with the Paris climate

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,869
agreement during a meeting with the
French president saying that other

20
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,729
countries namely China received a better
deal than the United States is it not

21
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,090
true that China let China set lower
standards for itself than did the u.s.

22
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,170
look a China is doing more than the u.s.
right now they're closing down coal

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,799
plants they're massively investing in
solar and wind they're mastering battery

24
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,630
technology which will help America so
this point that America got a bad deal

25
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,450
is fake it's more fake than any fake
news assertion by by President Trump

26
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,880
this agreement is so fundamental I mean
you watch all these hurricanes and the

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,520
devastation you can't take your mind off
extreme weather events that's exactly

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,780
what climate change is going to bring
about it may already bring bringing them

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,030
about so to omit that an existential
threat climate change that's what it is

30
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,549
it's irresponsible it's blind
it's almost I don't even know how he

31
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:21,629
gets away with that I have to call that
fake news or whatever you call a

32
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,590
president speech of that order in
reference to climate change this week

33
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,700
you compared Trump supporters to cave
dwellers you said quote you should check

34
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,930
out the derivation of Trump I and
troglodyte because they both refer to

35
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,150
people who dwell in deep dark caves are
you really calling the nearly 63 million

36
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,010
Trump voters cave dwellers no and if you
saw your own words there it was about

37
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,690
Trump ight and troglodyte it wasn't
about the millions of voters who voted

38
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,359
for President Trump many of which are
right in California know the people who

39
00:02:53,359 --> 00:03:02,189
closely advise climate denial advise
bluster wars advice stigmatizing and D

40
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:10,739
legitimizing our entire news industry as
fake yeah that that is really a calling

41
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,340
cave drawers because cave dwellers
didn't have TV like that but it is a

42
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:21,000
blindness it's a darkness that evades
the truth it really generates that kind

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,400
of disinformation that undermines
democracy and doesn't build dialogue

44
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,049
which we desperately need in this
country and between nations around the

45
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,139
world I want to ask you about some
legislation that you have on your desk

46
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,459
over the weekend California passed a
bill making the golden state a sanctuary

47
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:46,859
state that's there's no word sanctuary
this is a bill to have the Immigration

48
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:52,169
Service do their own work and not
attempt to conscript state officials

49
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:56,819
into being part of the Immigration
Service it does allow close cooperation

50
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:04,470
on data on drug busts and drug raids and
also working with the Immigration

51
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,459
Service whether it's from our prisons or
from the jails when you're dealing with

52
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,889
serious criminals so it protects Public
Safety but it also protects hard-working

53
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,459
people who contributed a lot to
California hardly hard-working people

54
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,659
who are undocumented immigrants yeah by
the way they've got a couple million

55
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:26,849
working our agricultural industry our
hospitality industry our construction

56
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,000
industry they're being deep
trouble without those same people and

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,520
that's why we need immigration reform
not blessed or not rhetoric and not this

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,560
kind of xenophobia that we see too much
of coming out of Washington do you think

59
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,350
that complying with federal immigration
laws are it's optional because that that

60
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,180
would be the counter-argument no no and
we comply with immigration laws where

61
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,030
we're not soldiers of Donald Trump or
the federal Immigration Service we have

62
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:03,780
our own laws to arrest criminals to give
them a jury trial and then to provide

63
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,460
appropriate punishment that's our job
now the immigration people can come out

64
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,380
of our jails they can interview people
they can pick up people that they think

65
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,510
are appropriate but don't tell
California to do your work in fact there

66
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,710
are many cases of people who the
Immigration Service said they wanted and

67
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,210
they don't even show up to come to get
them so this is a well balanced bill the

68
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,710
police chief of Los Angeles supported
there's a number of law enforcement

69
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,720
officials who said it was a much better
piece of legislation than what was

70
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,370
originally introduced and which got the
name sanctuary city or sanctuary state

71
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,000
another piece of legislation passed in
the California State Legislature Friday

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,230
would require presidential candidates to
release their five most recent years of

73
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,610
tax returns in order to be able to get
on the California ballot president Trump

74
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,320
has of course infamously refused to
release his returns he says he's under

75
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,660
audit you also have not released your
tax returns do you plan to sign actually

76
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,310
I did release them in my earlier
campaign so this time around my

77
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,230
opponents wouldn't do it so I didn't
either

78
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,170
I'm not going to tell you what I'll do
in the bill I want to read it I want to

79
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:18,470
look at the legality and in the face of
federal law so we'll take a look at it I

80
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,420
generally don't opine on the six hundred
bills that the legislature leaves on my

81
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,800
desk I take a look at each one I'll give
this a fair read and you'll hear my

82
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,110
decision very soon
all right California Governor Jerry

83
00:06:31,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Brown thanks so much really appreciate
