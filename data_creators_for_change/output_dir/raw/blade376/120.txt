00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
I know are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you thinking miles you look</font>

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,290
pretty rough right now and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,210
thinking that then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> apologize for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,460
so judgmental but a saying of mine that

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,679
I like to use again and again is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look</font>

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,700
how I feel and right now I do look how I

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,390
feel which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is rough and ill because I'm</font>

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,930
suffering with food poisoning her a

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,570
check on her a food poisoning which is

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,060
probably in my top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 illnesses to have</font>

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,150
if I was ever to be so insane to create

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:37,620
such a list movies now movies are

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,629
primarily a form of entertainment but

14
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,550
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they hit us deep down inside</font>

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,550
because we identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them perhaps</font>

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,180
it's a character<font color="#E5E5E5"> a theme or even the</font>

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,610
story as a whole my all-time favorite

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,620
movie<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one of these because when I</font>

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,930
first saw it I was completely shocked at

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,940
how much I related<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the main character</font>

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,829
and the experiences that they went

22
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">through and well the past two days</font>

23
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,579
whilst I've been enjoying the novelty of

24
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,210
having food poisoning I got to watch the

25
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,799
