HE IS NOT TRUMP ENOUGH, I DON'T

00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:02,366
THINK HE GETS IT.

54
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:03,200
IF YOU ARE NOT REPUBLICAN

55
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:03,868
WE ARE CONSERVATIVE.

56
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:05,636
WE WANT TO HAVE OUR CONSERVATIVE

57
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:06,370
AGENDA IMPLEMENTED IN WASHINGTON

58
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:13,310
AND IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE

59
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:13,778
INTENT ON DOING.

60
00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:14,512

ALREADY GONE TO THE POLLS.

64
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:21,619
THE PRESIDENT GETTING INVOLVED,

65
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:22,253
COMING OUT THAT LATE WAS

66
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:28,325
POSITIVE, SENT MORE PEOPLE TO

68
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:29,794
TO CHANGE, IF WE WANT OUR VOICES

69
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:30,528
HEARD IN WASHINGTON WE NEED TO

70
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:35,633
VOTE AND EXERCISE THAT RIGHT.

71
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:36,367
HEATHER: LOOK AT THAT WE YOU ARE

THIS IS THE ONE THAT CAME IN

74
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,240
LAST MINUTE, MARK SANFORD HAS

75
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,743
BEEN VERY UNHELPFUL TO ME IN MY

76
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:46,477
CAMPAIGN TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT

77
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:49,480

KATIE.

83
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,258
AND THE REFERENCE TO ARGENTINA,

84
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:05,596
A REFERENCE TO THE PERSONAL

85
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:06,263
ISSUES SANFORD HAD IN SOUTH

86
00:03:06,263 --> 00:03:06,630
CAROLINA.

87
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:15,673
HE HAS A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON

88
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:16,307
WITH HIM BUT DONALD TRUMP

89
00:03:16,307 --> 00:03:17,041
DOUBLED DOWN ON IT YESTERDAY, MY

90
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:17,775
POLITICAL REPRESENTATIVES DIDN'T

91
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:19,176
WANT ME TO GET INVOLVED IN THE

92
00:03:19,176 --> 00:03:19,844
PRIMARY, THAT SANFORD WOULD

93
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:25,950
EASILY WIN BUT FOR THE FEW HOURS

94
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,650
LEFT I FELT KATIE WAS SUCH A

95
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,384
GOOD CANDIDATE AND SANFORD WAS

96
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:30,221
SO GOOD HAD TO GIVE IT A SHOT,

97
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:30,855
CONGRATULATIONS TO KATIE

98
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:31,522
ARRINGTON AND PERHAPS THAT

99
00:03:31,522 --> 00:03:33,190
PUSHED YOU OVER THE EDGE AND

100
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:42,099
MADE YOU WIN BUT ALSO YOU HAVE A

101
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:42,700
SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUND.

102
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,434
PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE A NEWCOMER TO

103
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:44,168
POLITICS, 2016 YOU BECAME STATE

104
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:44,635
REPRESENTATIVE.

105
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:45,369
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO

106
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:55,613
IS NOT A CAREER

107
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:56,814
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO
IS NOT A CAREER POLITICIAN, HAD

108
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:57,515
REAL-WORLD EXPERIENCE.

109
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:57,948
>> ABSOLUTELY.

110
00:03:57,948 --> 00:03:58,482
THAT WAS RESOUNDING.

111
00:03:58,482 --> 00:03:59,116
WE SENT A BUSINESSMAN TO

112
00:03:59,116 --> 00:03:59,850
WASHINGTON BECAUSE WE WERE TIRED

113
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,484
OF CAREER POLITICIANS IN

114
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:01,452
WASHINGTON, TIRED OF NOT GETTING

115
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:01,785
RESULTS.

116
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:13,197
I WENT TO THE STATEHOUSE IN TWO

117
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:13,931
I WENT TO THE STATEHOUSE IN TWO

118
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:14,498
YEARS, I SHOOK IT UP.

119
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:15,232
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO

120
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,933
DO, GET WHAT WE NEED DONE FOR

121
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:16,433
OUR CONSTITUENTS.

122
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,101
I'M INTENT ON DOING THAT IN

123
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:17,500
WASHINGTON.

124
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,870
I WILL HE GO EIGHT YEARS, FOUR

125
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,603
TERMS, IF MY CONSTITUENTS BRING

126
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:22,239
ME BACK EVERY TWO YEARS, AND

127
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,641
THAT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM IN

128
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:25,876
THE CAREER POLITICIANS, THE

129
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:26,544
POLITICAL ELITE, THEY FEEL

130
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:30,247
SOMEHOW THEY ARE ENTITLED TO

131
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:33,784
THESE POSITIONS AND THINGS WE

132
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:34,518
NEED TO WORK HARD FOR EVERY TWO

133
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:34,818
YEARS.

134
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:36,353
THAT IS WHY THE HOUSE, THE

135
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:40,591
WORKFORCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE

136
00:04:40,591 --> 00:04:46,330
BODY, THAT IS ONE THING I PLAN

137
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,064
TO ENCOMPASS AND BE FOR THE NEXT

138
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:47,665
TWO YEARS AT A MINIMUM.

139
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:51,502
A LOT OF WORK BETWEEN NOW AND

140
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:52,202
NOVEMBER, BUT DONALD TRUMP'S

141
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:54,572
CONSERVATIVE AGENDA IS SOMETHING

142
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:55,172
THAT RESOUNDS WITH THE

143
00:04:55,172 --> 00:05:01,412
REPUBLICAN PARTY IN SOUTH

144
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:01,779
CAROLINA.

145
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:02,513
JILLIAN: HIS SUCCESSES WE HEARD

146
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:03,247
THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT, THE

147
00:05:03,247 --> 00:00:00,000
ECONOMY, THE LATEST SUMMIT WITH
