1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,658
BA YAH AND IT'S OVER.

2
00:00:02,658 --> 00:00:04,326
THIS IS INCREDIBLY

3
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:04,893
COMPLICATED.

4
00:00:04,893 --> 00:00:07,429
IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME.

5
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:08,497
>> Mike: WITH THAT I'M GOING

6
00:00:08,497 --> 00:00:09,531
TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND

7
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:10,799
BRING IN OUR PANEL.

8
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:13,769
STEVE HAYES EDITOR AND CHIEF

9
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,370
FOR THE.

10
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:21,143
KAREN TUMULTY AND OPINION

11
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:22,310
WRITER FOR THE "WASHINGTON

12
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,644
TIMES."

13
00:00:22,644 --> 00:00:23,245
STEVE, DOES IT HAPPEN.

14
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:24,546
>> I THINK THERE WILL BE

15
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:27,849
SOME KIND OF A SUMMIT.

16
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:28,483
YOU I DON'T THINK IT'S

17
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:29,518
LIKELY IN THE COMING MONTHS.

18
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:30,385
IT WAS SMART FOR THE

19
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:31,319
PRESIDENT TO TAKE A STEP

20
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:32,087
BACK HERE.

21
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:33,789
HE SEEMED AT LEAST IN HIS

22
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:34,956
PUBLIC COMMENTS VERY EAGER

23
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:36,358
FOR NOT ONLY THE SUMMIT BUT

24
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:37,826
FOR A DEAL SAYING THINGS

25
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:38,660
ABOUT KIM JONG UN THAT I

26
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,162
DON'T THINK WERE TRUE GIVING

27
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:41,496
HIM TOO MUCH RESPECT SAYING

28
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:42,664
WEIGHS VERY OPEN AND VERY

29
00:00:42,664 --> 00:00:43,031
HONORABLE.

30
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:44,066
AT ONE POINT THE PRESIDENT

31
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:45,567
TWEETED THAT KIM JONG UN HAD

32
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:46,935
AGREED TO DENUCLEARIZATION,

33
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:47,803
WHICH HE HADN'T.

34
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:48,837
SO I THINK IT'S SMART THAT

35
00:00:48,837 --> 00:00:49,871
THE PRESIDENT TOOK A STEP

36
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:50,572
BACK HERE.

37
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:55,977
I THINK HE HAD MIKE POMPEO

38
00:00:55,977 --> 00:00:58,246
AND JOHN BOLTON IN HIS EAR

39
00:00:58,246 --> 00:00:59,214
REMINDING HIM OF THE HISTORY

40
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:00,348
OF OF THE NORTH KOREAN

41
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:01,049
BEHAVIOR ON THIS.

42
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:02,350
THE HISTORY REALLY MATTERS.

43
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,253
IT'S NOT AS IF KIM JONG UN'S

44
00:01:05,253 --> 00:01:06,288
ACTUALLY GOING TO GIVE UP

45
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:07,389
HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.

46
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:08,657
IT'S BEEN A KEY COMPONENT OF

47
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:10,459
THE REGIME FOR THREE

48
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:10,926
DECADES.

49
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:12,227
IT WILL REMAIN A KEY

50
00:01:12,227 --> 00:01:13,395
COMPONENT OF THE REGIME AND

51
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:14,863
ANYTHING HAS TO START WITH

52
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:16,898
THAT PREMISE, I THINK.

53
00:01:16,898 --> 00:01:17,466
>> Mike: SPEAKING OF

54
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:17,999
PRESIDENTIAL TWEETS.

55
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,568
WE HAVE ONE HERE.

56
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:20,635
THE PRESIDENT TWEETING VERY

57
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:21,903
GOOD NEWS TO RECEIVE THE

58
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:23,205
WARM AND PRODUCTIVE

59
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:24,339
STATEMENT FROM NORTH KOREA.

60
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:26,441
WE WILL SOON SEE WHERE IT

61
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:27,175
LEADS.

62
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:28,877
HOPEFULLY LONG AND ENDURING

63
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:29,578
PROSPERITY AND PEACE.

64
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:30,946
ONLY TIME AND TALENT WILL

65
00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:32,647
TELL.

66
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,149
AND SARAH SANDERS THE PRESS

67
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:35,417
SECRETARY ALSO PROVIDED THIS

68
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:38,720
UPDATE.

69
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:40,489
>> AS THE PRESIDENT SAID

70
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:41,123
THIS MORNING CERTAINLY WE

71
00:01:41,123 --> 00:01:41,990
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A

72
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,324
MEETING.

73
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:43,158
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT JUST

74
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:44,192
LOOKING TO HAVE A MEETING.

75
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,461
HE IS NOT LOOKING FOR JUST A

76
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:47,062
CHEAP POLITICAL STUNT.

77
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:48,029
HE WANTS TO GET SOMETHING

78
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:50,632
THAT'S A LONG-LASTING AND

79
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:53,735
ACTUAL REAL SOLUTION.

80
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:54,503
THOUGHTS AT THIS STAGE.

81
00:01:54,503 --> 00:01:56,338
>> OF COURSE WE SHOULD ALL

82
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:58,507
BE ROOT FOR A LONG LASTING

83
00:01:58,507 --> 00:01:59,641
AND REAL SOLUTION.

84
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:00,842
IT'S NOT ONLY TIME AND

85
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:01,176
TALENT.

86
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:02,110
I WOULD HOPE THE

87
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,878
ADMINISTRATION, ONE OF THE

88
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:03,812
THINGS THAT THEY HAVE

89
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:05,046
LEARNED IS THAT THE OTHER

90
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:05,847
TWO THINGS THAT YOU NEED

91
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:07,749
GOING INTO THIS KIND OF

92
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:09,751
MEETING ARE PREPARATION AND

93
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:10,318
MESSAGE DISCIPLINE.

94
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,853
AND BOTH OF THOSE THINGS

95
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:15,857
REALLY SEEM TO BE LACKING.

96
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:16,491
STARTING FROM THE MOMENT

97
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:17,225
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

98
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:18,260
ANNOUNCED THAT THE SUMMIT

99
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,694
WAS HAPPENING WITHOUT

100
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:20,862
CONSULTING HIS FOREIGN

101
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:22,798
POLICY ADVISORS OR, YOU

102
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:25,567
KNOW, HIS OWN

103
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:26,101
ADMINISTRATION.

104
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:26,701
>> Mike: CHARLIE, YOUR

105
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:27,302
THOUGHTS AT THIS STAGE?

106
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:28,470
>> I THINK IT'S INTERESTING.

107
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,205
YOU KNOW, TO LISTEN TO.

108
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:32,941
SO DEMOCRATS COMPLAIN ABOUT.

109
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:33,642
SO STRATEGY HERE.

110
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:35,277
I THINK IT'S POLITICALLY

111
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:35,744
TONE DEAF.

112
00:02:35,744 --> 00:02:37,312
BECAUSE AS YOU SAY, KAREN,

113
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:39,147
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ROOTING

114
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:40,882
FOR SOME SUCCESS HERE.

115
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:43,451
AND THE NOTION THAT YOU HAVE

116
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:44,820
SOME DEMOCRATS, OBVIOUSLY

117
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,155
JUST MAKING A PARTISAN

118
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:47,522
CLAIM.

119
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:48,423
CRITICIZING THE PRESIDENT

120
00:02:48,423 --> 00:02:49,891
FOR EVEN HAVING THE MEETING.

121
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:53,295
AND GIVING HIM SO -- KIM

122
00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:54,496
JONG UN SOME STATURE HE

123
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:55,297
SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD.

124
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:57,332
MY GOODNESS WE JUST WENT

125
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:58,466
THROUGH 8 YEARS OF NOT ONLY

126
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:01,136
WHATEVER THEY CALLED IT, THE

127
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,771
STRATEGIC INDIFFERENCE IN

128
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:03,738
KOREA BUT ALSO THE

129
00:03:03,738 --> 00:03:04,739
NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN.

130
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:05,674
THE PROBLEM WASN'T THAT THEY

131
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:06,775
WERE NEGOTIATING WITH IRAN.

132
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:08,343
IT'S THAT THEY FELL FOR A

133
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:09,444
TERRIBLE DEAL.

134
00:03:09,444 --> 00:03:11,046
AND OF COURSE, JOHN KERRY,

135
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:12,714
DURING THAT TIME WAS SO

136
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:14,482
DESPERATE TO GET A DEAL, HE

137
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:15,817
PRACTICALLY MOVED IN WITH

138
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:18,286
THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF

139
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:18,587
IRAN.

140
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:20,088
AND WOUND UP WITH A REALLY,

141
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:20,789
REALLY BAD DEAL.

142
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:21,790
SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM THERE.

143
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,826
SO I THINK TO STEP BACK NOW

144
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:26,561
AND HAVE DEMOCRATS ALMOST

145
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:30,131
GLEEFUL WHEN THE TALKS GOT

146
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:33,101
CALLED OFF, IT IS A -- THEY

147
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,336
ARE TONE DEAF AGAIN

148
00:03:34,336 --> 00:03:38,673
POLITICALLY SPEAKING.

149
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:39,341
>> Mike: WAS SOME OF THIS

150
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:40,108
THE ART OF THE DEAL.

151
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:41,042
YOU SOUGHT PRESIDENT PULL

152
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,310
OUT YESTERDAY AND THE NORTH

153
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,445
KOREANS LAST NIGHT AROUND

154
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:44,446
NEWS TIME WERE SAYING WAIT A

155
00:03:44,446 --> 00:03:45,480
MINUTE, WE WOULD STILL LIKE

156
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:45,814
TO TALK.

157
00:03:45,814 --> 00:03:47,415
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT AT

158
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:49,150
LEAST DESERVES SOME RUNNING

159
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,452
ROOM HERE FOR IT BEING

160
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:51,519
EXACTLY THAT AND TO HAVE,

161
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,288
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY LIKE BOB

162
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:55,357
THEN THEN DID HE SEE

163
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:56,858
LECTURING US, MIKE POMPEO

164
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:57,759
YESTERDAY ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

165
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,860
THE ART OF THE DEAL IS NOT

166
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,395
THE SAME OF THE ART OF

167
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:00,762
DIPLOMACY.

168
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,264
MY GOODNESS, I MEAN, THE

169
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:03,431
EXPERTS HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE

170
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,266
FOR A LONG TIME.

171
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:05,133
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

172
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,368
WE HAVE A NUCLEAR NORTH

173
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:08,436
KOREA AND NEARLY A NUCLEAR

174
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:08,737
IRAN.

175
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:09,804
SO, OBVIOUSLY, MAYBE

176
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:11,373
SWITCHING IT UP AND TRYING

177
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:12,007
SOMETHING DIFFERENT MIGHT

178
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:14,509
NOT BE A BAD IDEA.

179
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:15,176
>> Mike: KAREN, DO YOU THINK

180
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:16,745
WE WILL BE BACK AND FORTH

181
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:17,913
AND BACK AND FORTH ON

182
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:18,713
WHETHER THIS IS GOING TO

183
00:04:18,713 --> 00:04:19,547
HAPPEN IN THE COMING WEEKS?

184
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:20,882
>> YES, I DO.

185
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:22,050
HOWEVER, YOU KNOW, ONE THING

186
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,451
WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED, I

187
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:24,819
THINK, FROM THIS IS THAT,

188
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:25,654
YOU KNOW, WHEN PRESIDENT

189
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:26,721
TRUMP WAS RUNNING FOR

190
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:27,055
OFFICE.

191
00:04:27,055 --> 00:04:29,391
HE SAID I LIKE TO BE

192
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:29,824
UNPREDICTABLE.

193
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:32,060
HE HAS, I THINK, DISCOVERED

194
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,462
THAT, YOU KNOW, CAN YOU

195
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:36,331
OVERDO UNPREDICTABILITY AS

196
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:36,965
WELL.

197
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:37,666
>> Mike: STEVE, WE HAVE SEEN

198
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,234
A BIT OF A DYNAMIC OF MIKE

199
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:40,502
POMPEO, PERHAPS, BEING THE

200
00:04:40,502 --> 00:04:41,670
GOOD COP IN THESE

201
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,605
NEGOTIATIONS AND THEN JOHN

202
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:44,239
BOLTON BEHIND THE SCENES

203
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,707
PERHAPS BEING THE BAD COP.

204
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:46,775
IS THAT YOUR READ OF THINGS?

205
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:48,343
>> WELL, IF HAVE YOU GOT

206
00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:49,344
MIKE POMPEO BEING THE GOOD

207
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:50,045
COP ON NORTH KOREA.

208
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:51,446
THAT'S A PRETTY HAWKISH

209
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:52,147
PLACE TO BE.

210
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:53,448
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT MIKE

211
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:54,683
POMPEO IS GIVING THE

212
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:55,717
PRESIDENT ADVICE THAT

213
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:57,285
SUGGESTS HE TAKE SERIOUSLY

214
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:58,787
THIS LONG HISTORY THAT WE

215
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:00,055
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND NOT

216
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:02,824
FALL FOR ANY PUBLIC GESTURES

217
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:03,959
THAT KIM JONG UN MIGHT

218
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,292
ENGAGE.

219
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:06,995
IN LOOK, POMPEO KNOWS

220
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:08,129
ARGUABLY MORE ABOUT THIS

221
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,130
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

222
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,665
HE HAS BEEN THERE AND MET

223
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:11,099
WITH HIM.

224
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:12,634
I THINK HE HAS A GOOD SENSE

225
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:14,402
OF WHAT THE ACTUAL ASK WAS.

226
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:15,737
WHAT THE REAL CONVERSATIONS

227
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:16,805
WERE BETTER THAN ANYBODY

228
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:17,105
ELSE.

229
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:18,573
HE IS ALSO, I THINK, QUITE

230
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:19,874
AWARE OF THIS HISTORY AND

231
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:21,109
THE HISTORY IS WHAT HAS TO

232
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:22,510
BE OUR GUIDE AS WE GO INTO

233
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,511
THESE DISCUSSIONS.

234
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:24,612
>> HOW DO YOU SEE THE NEXT

235
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:25,013
FEW WEEKS.

236
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:26,681
>> I THINK KAREN IS RIGHT.

237
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:31,686
I SUSPECT IT WILL BE

238
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:34,589
UNPREDICTABLE ANDED A HAWK.

239
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:36,558
IT CAN BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO BE

240
00:05:36,558 --> 00:05:40,595
UNPREDICTABLE WITH YOUR.

241
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:42,230
IT'S NOT GOOD TO HAVE OUR

242
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,735
ALLIES SPUN UP AND INTO

243
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:47,936
BEWILDERMENT ANNOUNCEMENT

244
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:48,303
LIKE THIS.

245
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:49,571
IMPORTANT TO KEEP THEM ON

246
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,472
BOARD AND TALK TO OTHERS

247
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:51,473
THAT NEED TO BE SUPPORTING

248
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:54,042
WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THESE

249
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:54,409
TALKS.

250
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,477
>> Mike: IN THE END DOES THE

251
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:56,745
DEAR LEADER WALK AWAY FROM

252
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:57,712
THE TABLE?

253
00:05:57,712 --> 00:05:59,047
>> THE THING IS ONE THING WE

254
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:00,515
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS WHAT

255
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:02,150
THESE NUCLEAR WEAPONS MEAN

256
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,451
TO KIM JONG UN.

257
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:06,221
AND THEY ARE LITERALLY TIED

258
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:08,923
TO HIS ACTUAL, PHYSICAL

259
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:10,025
SURVIVAL.

260
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:11,726
SO, I THINK THAT, AGAIN, WE

261
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:13,194
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS

262
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:14,362
NOT THE PRESIDENT KEEPS

263
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:15,830
SAYING WELL, WE COULD BRING

264
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,265
YOU ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND

265
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:19,334
WE COULD GUARANTEE YOUR

266
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:19,667
SAFETY.

267
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:22,303
KIM JONG UN KNOWS HE HAS GOT

268
00:06:22,437 --> 00:06:23,705
SAFETY AND THOSE ARE THOSE

269
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:26,041
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

270
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,642
>> CHARLIE, BRIEFLY, DO YOU

271
00:06:27,642 --> 00:00:00,000
EXPECT A RESULT.
