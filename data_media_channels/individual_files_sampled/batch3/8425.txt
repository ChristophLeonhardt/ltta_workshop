♪ ♪ Tucker: IN THE WAKE OF ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN'S RESIGNATION AS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW YORK, SOME OF HIS LONG-TIME FRIENDS ON THE LEFT ARE PROFESSING SHOCK. YOU HEARD THEM. WE JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT, THEY SAY. HOW CAN A MAN SO PUBLICLY COMMITTED TO FEMINISM BEAT WOMEN? IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BUT OF COURSE IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS IS ALWAYS A MARKER FOR SECRET CREEPINESS. THE PEOPLE YELLING THE LOUDEST ARE USUALLY HIDING THE MOST. KEEP THAT IN MIND THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE SOME DEMOCRATIC POLITICIAN LECTURING YOU ABOUT YOUR MORAL INFERIORITY. THAT'S THE GUY YOU NEED TO WATCH CAREFULLY. CHANCES ARE HE'S UP TO SOMETHING AWFUL BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. HYPOCRISY ISN'T JUST A FEATURE OF MODERN LIBERALISM, IF THE HEART OF MODERN LIBERALISM. EVER WONDER HOW PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATE FOR ABORTION CAN SAY THEY STAND FOR CHILDREN? A MOVEMENT THAT DEMONIZES AN ENTIRE RACE CAN CLAIM TO OPPOSE RACISM? AL GORE CAN TRAVEL BY PRIVATE JET WHILE TRYING TO BAN YOUR SUV. BECAUSE CONSISTENCY DOES NOT MATTER TO THE LEFT, ONLY VIRTUE MATTERS. WE ARE GOOD PEOPLE, THEREFORE WE MUST RULE. YOU ARE NOT, THEREFORE YOU MUST OBEY. AL GORE DOESN'T BELIEVE HE'S A HYPOCRITE. ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN PROBABLY DOESN'T THINK HE IS EITHER. YOU CAN'T COMMIT SIN IF YOUR INTENTIONS ARE PURE AND LIBERALS THINK THEIR INTENTIONS ARE THE PUREST. IF THAT SOUNDS LIKE THEOLOGY AND NOT PUBLIC POLICY, IT'S BECAUSE IT IS THEOLOGY. MODERN LIBERALISM IS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE PROTESTANT CHRISTIANITY THE LEFT WORKED SO HARD TO UNDERMINE AND DESTROY. THEY ARE SPEAKING THE LINKAGE OF FAITH, ALBEIT A FAITH WITHOUT GOD. THIS IS THE MAIN REASON THE RIGHT AND LEFT TALK PAST EACH OTHER, THE REASON OUR PUBLIC DEBATES ARE SO WEIRD AND UNSATISFYING. ONE SIDE ARRIVES WITH STATS AND FACTS AND ARGUMENTS AND THE OTHER GRABS ABOUT ITS DECENCY. ONE IS TRYING TO CONVINCE, THE OTHER SIDE IS TRYING TO CONVERT. YOU CAN BE THE LIBERAL IN AN ARGUMENT, BUT YOU CAN EVER CONVINCE THEM THEN YOU WON. HE CARES MUCH MORE DEEPLY THAN YOU AND THEREFORE KNOWS HE'S RIGHT. NOTHING CAN CONVINCE THEM OTHERWISE. SOMEWHERE TONIGHT ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN IS MARINATING IN HIS SHAME, PROBABLY UNSHAVEN AND ALONE. HIS CAREER IS OVER, HE FACES YEARS OF POTENTIAL LEGAL ACTION. HE IS A BROKEN MAN, HE IS IN AGONY AND GET ON SOME LEVELS DESPITE ALL OF THAT ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN STILL KNOWS HE'S A BETTER PERSON THAN YOU ARE. SET PARENT PREDICTED IN PUBLIC ON TWITTER THAT SCHNEIDERMAN WOULD BE EXPOSED AS A CREEP AND HE SAID IT LAST NOVEMBER. YESTERDAY HE TWEETED THIS. HOW DID I KNOW THIS AND NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO KNEW THIS? GREAT QUESTION. SETH JOINS US TONIGHT. THAT WAS A REMARKABLY PRESCIENT PRESCIENT PRESCIENT TWEET. TO ME IT WAS JUST KIND OF I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN OPEN SECRET. I HAD HEARD STORIES AND RUMORS ABOUT SCHNEIDERMAN FOR YEARS. I'D BEEN TOLD BY AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT PEOPLE SINCE MAYBE 2009 THAT HE IS INTO ROUGH SEX WITH WOMEN, THAT HE LIKES TO DATE STAFFERS AND IS A LITTLE PUSHY WITH THEM, THAT HE TRIED TO KIDNAP A REPORTER AND WOULDN'T LET HER OUT OF HIS CAR TAKING HER TO HIS APARTMENT. SO I SORT OF ASSUMED THAT THIS WAS JUST COMMON KNOWLEDGE. MORE OR LESS. I'M NOT DEEPLY INVOLVED IN ALBANY POLITICS OR NEW YORK CITY DEMOCRATIC CIRCLES. I'M AN EDITOR FOR A MODERATELY CONSERVATIVE MAGAZINE. Tucker: SO YOU ARE NOT EXACTLY IN THE LOOP AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF PROGRESSIVE NEW YORK IS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. EXACTLY. THAT'S WHY IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT EVERYONE WAS SAYING THIS IS THE CRAZIEST THING WE'VE EVER HEARD. Tucker: IS CLEARLY NOT. IF YOU RAISE A REALLY GOOD, I THINK I'M A CENTRAL QUESTION, WHICH IS IF YOU HEARD ABOUT IT, IS IT PLAUSIBLE THAT THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE, ONE OF HIS CLOSEST ALLIES, PRESUMABLY ONE OF HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS, ANDREW CUOMO, HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT? IT SEEMS IMPLAUSIBLE TO ME. IMPLAUSIBLE TO ME THAT ANY ELECTED OFFICIAL IN NEW YORK STATE HADN'T HEARD IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN SAY. ANDREW CUOMO HAS BEEN STEEPED IN NEW YORK STATE POLITICS FOR 40 YEARS. HE BASICALLY HAS A PRIVATE ARMY. HE KEEPS TABS ON EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE. HE'S EXTRAORDINARILY PARANOID. Tucker: I KNOW. SO I WOULD IMAGINE THAT HE WOULD KNOW EVERYTHING THAT EVERYONE IS UP TO AT ALL TIMES. Tucker: HE'S A THOROUGHLY BIZARRE PERSON. I'VE DEALT WITH HIM. THAT'S EXACTLY THE WORD THAT COMES TO MIND AND I DON'T USE IT LIGHTLY, HE'S PARANOID. THIS IS STRANGE BECAUSE SCHNEIDERMAN WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. IT WASN'T JUST SOME FUNCTIONARY. HE JUST WASN'T THE NIGHT CITY EDITOR OF THE DAILY NEWS. THE CHEESE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE STATE. THE SUGGESTION THAT HE KIDNAPPED SOMEBODY, YOU WOULD THINK THAT ONE OF HIS PEERS WOULD FOLLOW UP ON IT. YOU MIGHT THINK SO. AT THE SAME TIME, NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS UNIQUE POWERS AND IS AN IMMENSELY POWERFUL FIGURE. I DON'T THINK ANY ATTORNEY GENERAL ANY STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAS THE KIND OF POWER THAT THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES. HOWEVER, IF YOU NOTICE, OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN NEW YORK STATE AND NEW YORK CITY THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CORRUPTION INVESTIGATIONS. Tucker: YES. BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN LEADING THEM. THEY HAVE ALL BEEN LARGELY DONE BY THE FEDS. THERE'S TRIALS GOING ON IN ALBANY RIGHT NOW OVER SHELDON SILVER IS GOING TO BE RETRIED. A NUMBER OF ANDREW CUOMO'S ASSOCIATES, JOE WAS JUST CONVICT ASSOCIATES, JOE WAS JUST CONVICD ASSOCIATES, JOE WAS JUST CONVIC. THIS WAS FEDERAL ENDING NEW YORK CITY, INVESTIGATIONS OF BILL de BLASIO WERE LARGELY BEING DONE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. Tucker: KIND OF FUNNY. MEANWHILE, THIS GUY IS SUING EVERYBODY ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING. GLOBAL WARMING OR COMING UP WITH WAYS TO HAVE PART IN PROOF INDICTMENTS OF TRUMP ASSOCIATES OR SUING THE VITAMIN INDUSTRY. Tucker: MEANWHILE, THE CESSPOOL AROUND HIM GOES
