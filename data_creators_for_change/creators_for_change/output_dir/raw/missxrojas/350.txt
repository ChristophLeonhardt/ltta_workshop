1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,829
so today the first day of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ellipse I</font>

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:03,179
went to go and see the road race because

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:04,680
it was going on in southwest London

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,810
which was new we're in chill out and it

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,309
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing to say set up all of these</font>

6
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,690
fences everywhere and I got to see it

7
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">twice because you saw them on the way</font>

8
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,570
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> swim on the way back I chose</font>

9
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,009
different spots for each the first one I

10
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,870
was on richmond bridge way back i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was at</font>

11
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,039
richmond park just by the curve

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">men's by Christmas but it's very very</font>

13
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:36,600
low rate is 250 limited

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,710
the class is extremely sharp if you've

15
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,300
ever seen cycling lives you know how

16
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,130
ridiculously fast they go the police

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">cars support cars and pretty much</font>

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,770
everyone else on the track was

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,660
absolutely speeding<font color="#E5E5E5"> their face off such</font>

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,040
as the speed of Cyprus and such as a

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,989
skill to Cyprus now as I say on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

22
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:03,400
back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> run this extremely sharp bend</font>

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,959
and all the sudden this huge group of

24
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,340
psychosis appears and one of them

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,990
crashes into the barrier about two

26
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">metres away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from us as terrible as those</font>

27
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">things look on the screen they</font>

28
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,400
definitely look much much worse in

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,140
person especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> because there's the</font>

30
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,700
doubt of not knowing whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not any</font>

31
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,470
was surrounding was going to fall over I

32
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,729
mean we thought literally that everyone

33
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:20,050
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to start crashing into</font>

34
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,850
the barrier and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cancellara this website</font>

35
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,970
does he fell down so so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> annoyed but</font>

36
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,440
he's been doing extremely well and way

37
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">out from books</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hill from where I gather</font>

38
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,290
but he was such a trooper and as

39
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,729
everyone's fed off away from him he

40
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:32,530
quickly got his bike sorted out and he

41
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,820
couldn t jump back on a complete

42
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,890
complete<font color="#CCCCCC"> Olympian total respect for him</font>

43
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,390
it was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather a funny moment</font>

44
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,280
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a big Mexican flag and</font>

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,720
our big Mexican tops and we was

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,310
jabbering away in Spanish as we were

47
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,140
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do after seeing the first part</font>

48
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,580
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the race we went up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the park and</font>

49
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,140
stay there for about five hours waiting

50
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,580
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cycads to arriving their way</font>

51
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,500
back even though by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> midday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

52
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,580
pretty much someone at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crash</font>

53
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,900
barriers a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them were only one</font>

54
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,580
person deep and it kind of stayed that

55
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,200
way until the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last hour before they</font>

56
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,790
arrived so we're standing there with our

57
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,130
flags and waving<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the cars go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pass the</font>

58
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,990
support cars getting excited there's

59
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,190
some you had a conversation behind me

60
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,229
can anyone speak Mexican because then

61
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,729
maybe we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask those people to not</font>

62
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:08,530
wait the flag so we can see and they

63
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,260
went on and on and on at one point it

64
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">just snapped around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and said hey we've</font>

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,900
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for five hours it's the</font>

66
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Olympics I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bother</font>

67
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,450
people but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to wave our flags</font>

68
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,920
and I want you to add by the way

69
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,170
Mexicans don't speak Mexican they speak

70
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,090
Spanish culture yourself ultimately I

71
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,049
was like oh that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really much point</font>

72
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:24,760
being pissed off but i just wanted to

73
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,290
turn around give them the surprise of

74
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,910
their lives when I girl have been

75
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,440
jabbering away in Spanish was an English

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,900
person and also Mexican person so sort

77
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,390
of matanov in the horror of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cancellara</font>

78
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,549
falling down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how bad we all really</font>

was exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> London is to me I mean</font>

83
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,130
there are bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it that I wasn't</font>

84
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,720
familiar with there was so much of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

92
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,440
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have absolutely loved to hear</font>

those songs and and Terrell the hymns

94
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,770
and see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Industrial Revolution he's</font>

95
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,090
hanging us about history as it was going

96
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">on it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be like okay whatever it was</font>

97
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,510
really beautiful and I screamed my face

98
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,760
off and JK Rowling appeared and flame

99
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,770
the torch what a spectacle of design

100
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,240
i've been really course twice today the

101
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">first one was obviously the flag</font>

102
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,760
situation and the second one was when I

103
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,470
found out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the NBC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coverage in the</font>

104
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,590
United States cut the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ameren con the 77</font>

105
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,900
memorial piece the amp choreography

106
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,520
which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely beautiful with and</font>

107
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,810
weirdly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd have understood a bit more</font>

108
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,459
if they'd cut to advancements and stuff

109
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">for me we can't all have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VVC good no</font>

110
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,760
they cut to an interview<font color="#E5E5E5"> with michael</font>

111
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,620
phelps and it was apparently a very bad

112
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,150
interview with michael phelps and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

113
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,590
spend the whole time thinking and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

114
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jazzaar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a few other</font>

115
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,350
people were more in johnston as well

116
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,720
tweeted next<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tweety as well as saying</font>

117
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,690
imagine if there'd been a 911 world and

118
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,150
we'd cut to a random interview<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

119
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,620
else I mean the Opera would be

120
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,940
outrageous and it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of</font>

121
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,220
respecting other people and respecting

122
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,660
on their<font color="#CCCCCC"> country so i think that choice</font>

123
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,290
on the part of the NBC editing team was

124
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,540
just really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important and really</font>

125
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,459
insulting actually and it's sad in a way

126
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,470
because even if it hadn't been a tribute

127
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,959
it was such<font color="#CCCCCC"> and expect tacular piece of</font>

128
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,010
choreography and the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

129
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,230
didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> show live and i just know</font>

130
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,430
things got to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not my</font>

131
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,900
coverage so it doesn't really matter

132
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,970
that much the games<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue tomorrow</font>

133
