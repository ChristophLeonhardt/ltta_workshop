SO PROCEED. MR. CHAIRMAN, RANKING MEMBER MR. CHAIRMAN, RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN, MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE MY STATEMENT. I WROTE IT MYSELF YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. NO ONE HAS SEEN A DRAFT OR IT EXCEPT FOR ONE OF MY FORMER LAW EXCEPT FOR ONE OF MY FORMER LAW CLERKS. THIS IS MY STATEMENT. LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO, DR. FORD PUBLICLY ACCUSED ME OF DR. FORD PUBLICLY ACCUSED ME OF COMMITTING WRONGDOING AT AN EVENT MORE THAN 36 YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE BOTH IN HIGH SCHOOL. I DENIED THE ALLEGATION IMMEDIATELY, CATEGORICALLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY. ALL FOUR PEOPLE ALLEGEDLY AT THE ALL FOUR PEOPLE ALLEGEDLY AT THE EVENT, INCLUDING DR. FORD’S LONG-TIME FRIEND, MRS. KAISER, HAVE SAID THEY RECALL NO SUCH EVENT. HER LONG-TIME FRIEND, MRS. KAISER, SAID UNDER PENALTY MRS. KAISER, SAID UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY, THAT SHE DOES NOT KNOW ME. DOES NOT BELIEVE SHE EVER SAW ME DOES NOT BELIEVE SHE EVER SAW ME AT A PARTY EVER. HERE’S THE QUOTE FROM MRS. KAISER’S ATTORNEY LETTER. "SIMPLY PUT, MRS. KAISER DOES NOT KNOW MR. KAVANAUGH AND SHE HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF EVER BEING AT A PARTY OR GATHERING WHERE HE WAS PRESENT WITH OR WHITE DR. FORD." THINK ABOUT THAT FACT. THE DAY AFTER THE ALLEGATION APPEARED, I TOLD THIS COMMITTEE APPEARED, I TOLD THIS COMMITTEE THAT I WANTED A HEARING AS SOON THAT I WANTED A HEARING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO CLEAR MY NAME. I DEMANDED A HEARING FOR THE VERY NEXT DAY. UNFORTUNATELY, IT TOOK THE COMMITTEE TEN DAYS TO GET TO THIS HEARING. IN THOSE TEN LONG DAYS, AS WAS PREDICTABLE AND AS I PREDICTED, PREDICTABLE AND AS I PREDICTED, MY FAMILY AND MY NAME HAVE BEEN MY FAMILY AND MY NAME HAVE BEEN TOTALLY AND PERMANENTLY DESTROYED BY VICIOUS AND FALSE ADDITIONAL ACCUSATIONS. THE TEN-DAY DELAY HAS BEEN HARMFUL TO ME AND MY FAMILY, TO HARMFUL TO ME AND MY FAMILY, TO THE SUPREME COURT AND TO THE COUNTRY. WHEN THIS ALLEGATION FIRST AROSE, I WELCOMED ANY KIND OF INVESTIGATION. SENATE, FBI OR OTHERWISE. THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. THE COMMITTEE NOW IS CONDUCTED A I’VE COOPERATED FULLY. I KNOW THAT ANY KIND OF INVESTIGATION, SENATE, FBI, MONTGOMERY COUNTY POLICE, WHATEVER WILL CLEAR ME. LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE I KNOW. LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE KNOWN ME MY WHOLE LIFE. LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT I’VE GROWN UP WITH AND WORKED WITH AND DATED AND TAUGHT AND GONE TO AND PLAYED WITH AND COACHED WITH AND DATED AND TAUGHT AND GONE TO GAMES WITH AND HAD BEERS WITH. LISTEN TO THE WITNESSES WHO ALLEGEDLY WERE AT THIS EVENT 36 ALLEGEDLY WERE AT THIS EVENT 36 YEARS AGO. LISTEN TO MISS KAISER. SHE DOES NOT KNOW ME. I WAS NOT AT THE PARTY DESCRIBED I WAS NOT AT THE PARTY DESCRIBED BY DR. FORD. THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS HAS BECOME A NATIONAL DISGRACE. THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE SENATE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE SENATE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS. BUT YOU HAVE REPLACED ADVICE AND BUT YOU HAVE REPLACED ADVICE AND CONSENT WITH SEARCH AND DESTROY. CONSENT WITH SEARCH AND DESTROY. SINCE MY NOMINATION IN JULY, THERE’S BEEN A FRENZY ON THE LEFT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING, LEFT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING, ANYTHING TO BLOCK MY CONFIRMATION. SHORTLY AFTER I WAS NOMINATED, THE DEMOCRATIC SENATE LEADER SAID HE WOULD OPPOSE ME WITH EVERYTHING HE’S GOT. A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR ON THIS COMMITTEE PUBLICLY REFERRED TO ME AS EVIL. EVIL. THINK ABOUT THAT WORD. SAID THAT THOSE THAT SUPPORTED ME WERE "COMPLICIT AND EVIL." ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR ON THIS COMMITTEE SAID "JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE." A FORMER HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC A FORMER HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE SAID "JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL THREATEN THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS FOR DECADES TO COME." I UNDERSTAND THE PASSIONS OF THE I UNDERSTAND THE PASSIONS OF THE MOMENT. I WOULD SAY TO THOSE SENATORS, YOUR WORDS HAVE MEANING. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LISTENED CAREFULLY TO YOU. GIVEN COMMENTS LIKE THOSE, IS IT GIVEN COMMENTS LIKE THOSE, IS IT ANY SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO MAKE ANY PHYSICAL THREAT AGAINST MAKE ANY PHYSICAL THREAT AGAINST MY FAMILY? TO SEND ANY VIOLENT E-MAIL TO MY TO SEND ANY VIOLENT E-MAIL TO MY WIFE, TO MAKE ANY KIND OF ALLEGATION AGAINST ME AND AGAINST MY FRIENDS TO BLOW ME UP AGAINST MY FRIENDS TO BLOW ME UP AND TAKE ME DOWN. YOU SOWED THE WIND FOR DECADES TO COME. I FEAR THAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL REAP THE WHIRLWINDS. THE BEHAVIOR OF SEVERAL OF THE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AT MY HEARING A FEW WEEKS AGO WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT. BUT AT LEAST IT WAS JUST A GOOD BUT AT LEAST IT WAS JUST A GOOD OLD FASHIONED ATTEMPT AT BORKING. THOSE EFFORTS DIDN’T WORK. WHEN I DID AT LEAST OKAY ENOUGH WHEN I DID AT LEAST OKAY ENOUGH AT THE HEARINGS THAT IT LOOKS LIKE I MIGHT GET CONFIRMED, A NEW TACTIC WAS NEEDED. SOME OF YOU WERE LYING IN WAIT AND HAD IT READY. THIS FIRST ALLEGATION WAS HELD IN SECRET FOR WEEKS BY A DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE AND BY STAFF. IT WOULD BE NEEDED ONLY IF YOU COULDN’T TAKE ME OUT ON THE MERITS. WHEN IT WAS NEEDED, THIS ALLEGATION WAS UNLEASHED AND PUBLICLY DEPLOYED OVER DR. FORD’S WISHES. AND THEN, AND THEN, AS NO DOUBT AND THEN, AND THEN, AS NO DOUBT WAS EXPECTED, IF NOT PLANNED CAME A LONG SERIES OF FALSE LAST-MINUTE SMEARS DESIGNED TO SCARE ME AND DRIVE ME OUT OF THE SCARE ME AND DRIVE ME OUT OF THE PROCESS BEFORE ANY HEARING OCCURRED. CRAZY STUFF. GANGS, ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN, FIGHTS ON BOATS IN RHODE ISLAND. FIGHTS ON BOATS IN RHODE ISLAND. ALL NONSENSE. RECORDED BREATHLESSLY AND OFTEN RECORDED BREATHLESSLY AND OFTEN UNCRITICALLY BY THE MEDIA. THIS IS DESTROYED MY FAMILY AND THIS IS DESTROYED MY FAMILY AND MY GOOD NAME. A GOOD NAME BUILT UP THROUGH DECADES OF VERY HARD WORK AND PUBLIC SERVICE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. THIS WHOLE TWO-WEEK EFFORT HAS BEEN A CALCULATED AND ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT. FUELED WITH APPARENT PENT-UP ANGER ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND ANGER ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 2016 ELECTION, FEAR THAT HAS THE 2016 ELECTION, FEAR THAT HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY STOKED ABOUT MY JUDICIAL RECORD, REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE CLINTONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MONEY FROM OUTSIDE LEFT-WING OPPOSITION GROUPS. THIS IS A CIRCUS. THE CONSEQUENCES WILL EXTEND LONG PAST MY NOMINATION. THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE WITH US THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE WITH US FOR DECADES. THIS GROTESQUE AND COORDINATED CHARACTER ASSASSINATION WILL DISSUADE CONFIDENT AND GOOD PEOPLE OF ALL POLITICAL PERSUASIONS FROM SERVING OUR COUNTRY. AS WE KNOW IN THE UNITED STATES AS WE KNOW IN THE UNITED STATES POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE EARLY 2000s, WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND. I AM AN OPTIMISTIC GUY. I ALWAYS TRY TO BE ON THE SUNRISE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN TO SUNRISE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE DAY THAT BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE DAY THAT IS COMING BUT TODAY, I HAVE TO SAY THAT I FEAR FOR THE FUTURE. LAST TIME I WAS HERE, I TOLD THIS COMMITTEE THAT A FEDERAL JUDGE MUST BE INDEPENDENT, NOT SWAYED BY PUBLIC OR POLITICAL PRESSURE. I SAID I WAS SUCH A JUDGE. AND I AM. I WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED INTO WITHDRAWING FROM THIS PROCESS. YOU HAVE TRIED HARD. YOU GIVEN IT YOUR ALL. NO ONE CAN QUESTION YOUR EFFORT. NO ONE CAN QUESTION YOUR EFFORT. YOUR COORDINATED AND WELL-FUNDED YOUR COORDINATED AND WELL-FUNDED EFFORT TO DESTROY MY GOOD NAME AND DESTROYED MY FAMILY WILL NOT AND DESTROYED MY FAMILY WILL NOT DRAG ME OUT. THE VILE THREATS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST MY FAMILY WILL NOT DRIVE AGAINST MY FAMILY WILL NOT DRIVE ME OUT. YOU MAY DEFEAT ME IN THE FINAL VOTE, BUT YOU’LL NEVER GET ME TO VOTE, BUT YOU’LL NEVER GET ME TO QUIT. NEVER! I’M HERE TODAY TO TELL THE TRUTH. I’VE NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ANYONE. NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL, NOT IN COLLEGE, NOT EVER. SEXUAL ASSAULT IS HORRIFIC. ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS TO THIS DAY IS A WOMAN WHO WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED AND WHO IN THE 1990s WHEN WE WERE IN OUR 30s CONFIDED IN ME ABOUT THE ABUSE. CONSULT MY ADVICE. I WAS ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE SHE I WAS ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE SHE CONSULTED. ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT MUST ALWAYS BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, MUST ALWAYS BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, ALWAYS. THOSE THAT MAKE ALLEGATIONS ALWAYS DESERVE TO BE HEARD. AT THE SAME TIME, THE PERSON WHO AT THE SAME TIME, THE PERSON WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF THE ALLEGATIONS ALSO DESERVES TO BE ALLEGATIONS ALSO DESERVES TO BE HEARD. DUE PROCESS IS THE FOUNDATION OF DUE PROCESS IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE AMERICAN RULE OF LAW. DUE PROCESS MEANS LISTENING TO BOTH SIDES. AS I TOLD YOU IN MY HEARING THREE WEEKS AGO, I’M THE ONLY CHILD OF MARTHA AND ED KAVANAUGH. THEY’RE HERE TODAY. WHEN I WAS 10, MY MOM WENT TO LAW SCHOOL. AS A LAWYER, SHE WORKED HARD AND AS A LAWYER, SHE WORKED HARD AND OVERCAME BARRIERS INCLUDING WORKPLACE SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT WORKPLACE SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT SO MANY WOMEN FACED AT THE TIME SO MANY WOMEN FACED AT THE TIME AND STILL FACE TODAY. SHE BECAME A TRAIL BLAZER. ONE OF MARYLAND’S EARLIEST WOMEN ONE OF MARYLAND’S EARLIEST WOMEN PROSECUTORS AND TRIAL JUDGES. SHE AND MY DAD TAUGHT ME THE IMPORTANCE OF A QUALITY AND RESPECT FOR ALL PEOPLE AND SHE INSPIRED ME TO BE A LAWYER AND A INSPIRED ME TO BE A LAWYER AND A JUDGE. LAST TIME I WAS HERE, I TOLD YOU LAST TIME I WAS HERE, I TOLD YOU THAT WHEN MY MOM WAS A PROSECUTOR AND I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, SHE USED TO PRACTICE HER SCHOOL, SHE USED TO PRACTICE HER CLOSING ARGUMENTS AT THE DINING CLOSING ARGUMENTS AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE ON MY DAD AND ME. AS I TOLD YOU, HER TRADEMARK LINE WAS, USE YOUR COMMON SENSE. LINE WAS, USE YOUR COMMON SENSE. WHAT RINGS TRUE. WHAT RINGS FALSE. HER TRADEMARK LINE IS A GOOD REMINDER AS WE SIT HERE TODAY SOME 36 YEARS AFTER THE ALLEGED SOME 36 YEARS AFTER THE ALLEGED EVENT OCCURRED WHEN THERE’S NO CORROBORATION AND INDEED IT’S REFUTED BY THE PEOPLE ALLEGEDLY REFUTED BY THE PEOPLE ALLEGEDLY THERE. AFTER I HAVE BEEN IN THE PUBLIC AFTER I HAVE BEEN IN THE PUBLIC A HINT, A WHIFF OF AN ALLEGATION ARENA FOR 26 YEARS WITHOUT EVEN A HINT, A WHIFF OF AN ALLEGATION LIKE THIS. WHEN MY NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT WAS JUST ABOUT TO SUPREME COURT WAS JUST ABOUT TO BE VOTED ON, AT A TIME WHEN I’M BE VOTED ON, AT A TIME WHEN I’M CALLED EVIL BY DEMOCRATIC MEMBER CALLED EVIL BY DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE, WHILE DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS OF MY NOMINATION SAY PEOPLE WILL DIE IF I’M CONFIRMED, THIS ONSLAUGHT IF I’M CONFIRMED, THIS ONSLAUGHT OF LAST-MINUTE ALLEGATIONS DOES OF LAST-MINUTE ALLEGATIONS DOES NOT RING TRUE. I’M NOT QUESTIONING THAT DR. FORD MAY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY DR. FORD MAY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY SOME PERSON IN SOMEPLACE AT SOME TIME. BUT I HAVE NEVER DONE THIS TO HER OR TO ANYONE. THAT’S NOT WHO I AM, IT IS NOT WHO I WAS. I AM INNOCENT OF THIS CHARGE. I INTEND NO ILL WILL TO DR. FORD I INTEND NO ILL WILL TO DR. FORD AND HER FAMILY. THE OTHER NIGHT, ASHLEY AND MY DAUGHTER, LIZA SAID THEIR PRAYERS. LITTLE LIZA ALL OF 10 YEARS OLD LITTLE LIZA ALL OF 10 YEARS OLD SAID TO ASHLEY, WE SHOULD PRAY FOR THE WOMAN. A LOT OF WISDOM FROM A 10-YEAR-OLD. WE MEAN NO ILL WILL. FIRST, LET’S START WITH MY CAREER. FOR THE LAST 26 YEARS SINCE 1992, I HAVE SERVED IN MANY HIGH-PROFILE AND SENSITIVE GOVERNMENT POSITIONS FOR WHICH THE FBI HAS INVESTIGATED MY BACKGROUND SIX SEPARATE TIMES. SIX SEPARATE FBI BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS OVER 26 YEARS. ALL OF THEM AFTER THE EVENT ALLEGED HERE. I HAVE BEEN IN THE PUBLIC ARENA I HAVE BEEN IN THE PUBLIC ARENA IN UNDER EXTREME PUBLIC SCRUTINY IN UNDER EXTREME PUBLIC SCRUTINY FOR DECADES. IN 1992, I WORKED FOR THE OFFICE IN 1992, I WORKED FOR THE OFFICE OF SOLICITOR GENERAL IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. IN 1993, I CLERKED ON THE SUPREME COURT FOR JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY. I SPENT FOUR YEARS AT THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL’S OFFICE IN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL’S OFFICE IN THE 1990s. THAT OFFICE WAS THE SUBJECT OF ENORMOUS SCRUTINY FROM THE MEDIA ENORMOUS SCRUTINY FROM THE MEDIA AND THE PUBLIC. DURING 1998, THE YEAR OF THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON, OUR OFFICE GENERALLY AND I PERSONALLY WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTENSE NATIONAL MEDIA AND POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT. I AND OTHER LEADING MEMBERS OF KEN STARR’S OFFICE WERE OPPOSITION RESEARCH FROM HEAD TO OPPOSITION RESEARCH FROM HEAD TO TOE FROM BIRTH THROUGH THE PRESENT DAY. RECALL THE PEOPLE THAT WERE EXPOSED THAT YEAR OF 1998 OF HAVING ENGAGED IN SOME SEXUAL WRONGDOINGS OR PROBLEMS IN THEIR WRONGDOINGS OR PROBLEMS IN THEIR PAST. ONE PERSON ON THE LEFT PAID A MILLION DOLLARS FOR REPORTS OF SEXUAL WRONG DOING. IT WORKED. EXPOSED SOME PROMINENT PEOPLE. NOTHING ABOUT ME. FROM 2001 TO 2006, I WORKED FOR FROM 2001 TO 2006, I WORKED FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH IN THE PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AS STAFF SECRETARY, I WAS BY PRESIDENT BUSH’S SIDE FOR THREE PRESIDENT BUSH’S SIDE FOR THREE YEARS AND WAS ENTRUSTED WITH THE YEARS AND WAS ENTRUSTED WITH THE NATION’S MOST SENSITIVE SECRETS. NATION’S MOST SENSITIVE SECRETS. I TRAVELED ON AIR FORCE ONE ALL I TRAVELED ON AIR FORCE ONE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD WITH PRESIDENT BUSH. I WENT EVERYWHERE WITH HIM FROM I WENT EVERYWHERE WITH HIM FROM TEXAS TO PAKISTAN, FROM ALASKA TO AUSTRALIA, FROM BUCKINGHAM PALACE TO THE VATICAN. THREE YEARS IN THE WEST WING, 5 1/2 YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I WAS THEN NOMINATED TO BE A JUDGE ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT. I WAS THOROUGHLY VETTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE, THE FBI, THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION AND THIS COMMITTEE. I SAT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE FOR I SAT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE FOR TWO THOROUGH CONFIRMATION HEARINGS IN 2004 AND 2006. FOR THE PAST 12 YEARS, LEADING UP TO MY NOMINATION FOR THIS JOB UP TO MY NOMINATION FOR THIS JOB I’VE SERVED IN A VERY PUBLIC ARENA AS A FEDERAL JUDGE ON WHAT ARENA AS A FEDERAL JUDGE ON WHAT IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT COURT IN THE COUNTRY. I’VE HANDLED SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CASES AFFECTING THE SIGNIFICANT CASES AFFECTING THE LIVES AND QUESTIONS, MORE THAN ALL PREVIOUS SUPREME COURT NOMINEES PREVIOUS SUPREME COURT NOMINEES COMBINED. THROUGHOUT THAT ENTIRE TIME, THROUGHOUT MY 53 YEARS AND SEVEN THROUGHOUT MY 53 YEARS AND SEVEN MONTHS ON THIS EARTH UNTIL LAST MONTHS ON THIS EARTH UNTIL LAST WEEK, NO ONE EVER ACCUSED ME OF WEEK, NO ONE EVER ACCUSED ME OF ANY KIND OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. NO ONE EVER. A LIFETIME. A LIFETIME OF HIGH PROFILE A LIFETIME OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND PUBLIC SERVICE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. NEVER A HINT OF ANYTHING OF THIS NEVER A HINT OF ANYTHING OF THIS KIND. AND THAT’S BECAUSE NOTHING OF THIS KIND EVER HAPPENED. SECOND, LET’S TURN TO SPECIFICS. SECOND, LET’S TURN TO SPECIFICS. I CATEGORICALLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY DENY THE ALLEGATION AGAINST ME BY DR. FORD. I NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL OR PHYSICAL ENCOUNTER OF ANY KIND WITH DR. FORD. I NEVER ATTENDED A GATHERING LIKE THE ONE THAT DR. FORD DESCRIBES IN HER ALLEGATION. I’VE NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED DR. FORD OR ANYONE. AGAIN, I’M NOT QUESTIONING THAT AGAIN, I’M NOT QUESTIONING THAT DR. FORD MAY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY DR. FORD MAY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY SOME PERSON, IN SOMEPLACE, AT SOME TIME, BUT I HAVE NEVER DONE THAT TO HER OR TO ANYONE. DR. FORD’S ALLEGATION STEMS FROM DR. FORD’S ALLEGATION STEMS FROM A PARTY THAT SHE ALLEGES OCCURRED DURING THE SUMMER OF 1982. 36 YEARS AGO. I WAS 17 YEARS OLD. BETWEEN MY JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL AT GEORGETOWN PREP, A RIGOROUS ALL GEORGETOWN PREP, A RIGOROUS ALL BOYS CATHOLIC JESUIT HIGH SCHOOL BOYS CATHOLIC JESUIT HIGH SCHOOL IN ROCKVILLE, MARYLAND. WHEN MY FRIENDS AND I SPENT TIME WHEN MY FRIENDS AND I SPENT TIME TOGETHER AT PARTIES ON WEEKENDS, TOGETHER AT PARTIES ON WEEKENDS, IT WAS USUALLY WITH FRIENDS FROM IT WAS USUALLY WITH FRIENDS FROM NEARBY CATHOLIC ALL-GIRL HIGH SCHOOLS, STONE RIDGE, HOLY CHILD, VISITATION, HOLY CROSS. DR. FORD DID NOT ATTEND ONE OF THOSE SCHOOLS. SHE ATTENDED AN INDEPENDENT PRIVATE SCHOOL NAMED HOLTON-ARMS PRIVATE SCHOOL NAMED HOLTON-ARMS AND SHE WAS A YEAR BEHIND ME. IT’S POSSIBLE WE MET AT SOME POINT AT SOME EVENTS, ALTHOUGH I POINT AT SOME EVENTS, ALTHOUGH I DO NOT RECALL THAT. TO REPEAT, ALL OF THE PEOPLE IDENTIFIED BY DR. FORD AS BEING IDENTIFIED BY DR. FORD AS BEING PRESENT AT THE PARTY HAVE SAID THEY DO NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING SUCH PARTY EVER HAPPENING. IMPORTANTLY, HER FRIEND, MRS. KAISER, HAS NOT ONLY DENIED MRS. KAISER, HAS NOT ONLY DENIED KNOWLEDGE OF THE PARTY, MRS. KAISER SAID UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY, SHE DOES NOT KNOW ME. OF FELONY, SHE DOES NOT KNOW ME. DOES NOT RECALL EVER BEING AT A DOES NOT RECALL EVER BEING AT A PARTY WITH ME EVER. AND MY TWO MALE FRIENDS THAT WERE ALLEGEDLY THERE THAT KNOW ME WELL SAID THEY DON’T RECALL A ME WELL SAID THEY DON’T RECALL A PARTY AND NEVER DID OR WOULD DO PARTY AND NEVER DID OR WOULD DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS. DR. FORD’S ALLEGATION IS NOT MERELY UNCORROBORATED, IT’S REFUTED BY THE VERY PEOPLE THAT REFUTED BY THE VERY PEOPLE THAT SHE SAYS WERE THERE, INCLUDING BY A LONG-TIME FRIEND OF HERS, REFUTED. THIRD, DR. FORD HAS SAID THAT THIS EVENT OCCURRED AT A HOUSE NEAR COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB WHICH NEAR COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB WHICH IS AT THE CORNER OF CONNECTICUT IS AT THE CORNER OF CONNECTICUT AVENUE AND EAST WEST HIGHWAY IN AVENUE AND EAST WEST HIGHWAY IN CHEVY CHASE, MARYLAND. IN HER LETTER TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN, SHE SAID THERE WERE FOUR OTHER PEOPLE AT THE HOUSE. NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE, NOR I, LIVED NEAR COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB. AS OF THE SUMMER OF 1982, DR. FORD WAS 15 AND COULD NOT DRIVE YET. SHE DID NOT LIVE NEAR COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB. SHE SAYS CONFIDENTLY THAT SHE HAD ONE BEER AT THE PARTY. SHE DOES NOT SAY HOW SHE GOT TO SHE DOES NOT SAY HOW SHE GOT TO THE HOUSE IN QUESTION OR HOW SHE THE HOUSE IN QUESTION OR HOW SHE GOT HOME OR WHOSE HOUSE IT WAS. FOURTH, I HAVE SUBMITTED TO THIS FOURTH, I HAVE SUBMITTED TO THIS COMMITTEE DETAILS CALENDARS RECORDING MY ACTIVITIES IN THE SUMMER OF 1982. WHY DID I KEEP CALENDARS? MY DAD STARTED KEEPING DETAILED MY DAD STARTED KEEPING DETAILED CALENDARS OF HIS LIFE IN 1978. HE DID SO AS BOTH A CALENDAR AND HE DID SO AS BOTH A CALENDAR AND A DIARY. HE’S A VERY ORGANIZED GUY TO PUT HE’S A VERY ORGANIZED GUY TO PUT IT MILDLY. CHRISTMAS TIME, WE SAT AROUND AND HE WOULD TELL OLD STORIES. OLD MILESTONES, OLD WEDDINGS, OLD EVENTS FROM HIS CALENDARS. IN NINTH GRADE, IN NINTH GRAD IN NINTH GRADE IN 1980, I STARTED KEEPING CALENDARS OF MY OWN. FOR ME ALSO, IT’S A CALENDAR AND FOR ME ALSO, IT’S A CALENDAR AND A DIARY. I’VE KEPT SUCH CALENDAR DIARIES I’VE KEPT SUCH CALENDAR DIARIES THE LAST 38 YEARS. MINE ARE NOT AS GOOD AS MY DAD’S MINE ARE NOT AS GOOD AS MY DAD’S IN SOME YEARS AND WHEN I WAS A KID, THE CALENDARS ARE ABOUT WHAT YOU’D EXPECT FROM A KID. GOOFY PARTS, SOME EMBARRASSING PARTS. BUT I DID HAVE THE SUMMER OF 1982 DOCUMENTED PRETTY WELL. THE EVENT DESCRIBED BY DR. FORD THE EVENT DESCRIBED BY DR. FORD PRESUMABLY HAPPENED ON A WEEKEND PRESUMABLY HAPPENED ON A WEEKEND BECAUSE I BELIEVE EVERYONE WORKED AND HAD JOBS IN THE SUMMERS. IN ANY EVENT, A DRUNKEN EARLY EVENING EVENT OF THE KIND SHE DESCRIBES PRESUMABLY HAPPENED ON DESCRIBES PRESUMABLY HAPPENED ON A WEEKEND. IF IT WAS A WEEKEND, MY CALENDAR IF IT WAS A WEEKEND, MY CALENDAR SHOW THAT I WAS OUT OF TOWN ALMOST EVERY WEEKEND NIGHT BEFORE FOOTBALL TRAINING CAMP STARTED IN LATE AUGUST. THE ONLY WEEKEND NIGHTS THAT I WAS IN D.C. WERE FRIDAY, JUNE 4 WAS IN D.C. WERE FRIDAY, JUNE 4 WHEN I WAS WITH MY DAD AT A PRO WHEN I WAS WITH MY DAD AT A PRO GOLF TOURNAMENT. AND HAD MY HIGH SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT TEST AT 8:30 THE NEXT MORNING. I ALSO WAS IN D.C.

AND THEN ON THE WEEKEND OF AUGUST 20 TO 22, I WAS STAYING AT THE GARRETTS WITH PAT AND CHRIS AS WE DID FINAL PREPARATIONS FOR FOOTBALL TRAINING CAMP THAT BEGAN ON SUNDAY THE 22nd. AS THE CALENDARS CONFIRM, THE WEEKEND BEFORE A BRUTAL TRAINING WEEKEND BEFORE A BRUTAL TRAINING CAMP SCHEDULE WAS NO TIME FOR PARTIES. SO LET ME EMPHASIZE THIS POINT. IF THE PARTY DESCRIBED BY DR. FORD HAPPENED IN THE SUMMER DR. FORD HAPPENED IN THE SUMMER OF 1982 ON A WEEKEND NIGHT, MY CALENDARS SHOW ALL BUT DEFINITIVELY I WAS NOT THERE. DURING THE WEEK DAYS IN THE SUMMER OF 1982, AS YOU CAN SEE, SUMMER OF 1982, AS YOU CAN SEE, I WAS OUT OF TOWN FOR TWO WEEKS I WAS OUT OF TOWN FOR TWO WEEKS OF THE SUMMER FOR A TRIP TO THE OF THE SUMMER FOR A TRIP TO THE BEACH WITH FRIENDS AND AT THE LEGENDARY FIVE-STAR BASKETBALL CAMP IN HONESDALE, PENNSYLVANIA. CAMP IN HONESDALE, PENNSYLVANIA. WHEN I WAS IN TOWN, I SPENT MUCH WHEN I WAS IN TOWN, I SPENT MUCH OF MY TIME WORKING, WORKING OUT, OF MY TIME WORKING, WORKING OUT, LIFTING WEIGHTS, PLAYING BASKETBALL OR HANGING OUT AND HAVING SOME BEERS WITH FRIENDS AS WE TALKED ABOUT LIFE AND FOOTBALL AND SCHOOL AND GIRLS. SOME HAVE NOTICED I DIDN’T HAVE SOME HAVE NOTICED I DIDN’T HAVE CHURCH ON SUNDAYS ON MY CALENDARS. I ALSO DIDN’T LIST BRUSHING MY TEETH AND FOR ME, GOING TO CHURCH ON SUNDAYS WAS LIKE BRUSHING MY TEETH. AUTOMATIC. STILL IS. IN THE SUMMER OF 1981, I WORKED IN THE SUMMER OF 1981, I WORKED CONSTRUCTION. IN THE SUMMER OF 1982, MY JOB WAS CUTTING LAWNS. I HAD MY OWN BUSINESS OF SORTS. YOU SEE SOME SPECIFICS ABOUT THE YOU SEE SOME SPECIFICS ABOUT THE LAWN CUTTING LISTED ON THE AUGUST CALENDAR PAGE WHEN I HAD AUGUST CALENDAR PAGE WHEN I HAD THE TIME THE LAST LAWN CUTTINGS THE TIME THE LAST LAWN CUTTINGS OF THE SUMMER OF VARIOUS LAWNS BEFORE FOOTBALL TRAINING CAMP. I PLAYED IN A LOT OF SUMMER LEAGUE BASKETBALL GAMES FOR THE LEAGUE BASKETBALL GAMES FOR THE GEORGETOWN PREP TEAM AT NIGHT AT GEORGETOWN PREP TEAM AT NIGHT AT BLAIR HIGH SCHOOL IN SILVER SPRING. MANY NIGHTS I WORKED OUT WITH OTHER GUYS AT TOBIN’S HOUSE. HE WAS THE GREAT QUARTERBACK ON HE WAS THE GREAT QUARTERBACK ON OUR FOOTBALL TEAM. HIS DAD RAN WORKOUTS. OR LIFTED WEIGHTS AT GEORGETOWN OR LIFTED WEIGHTS AT GEORGETOWN PREP IN PREPARATION FOR THE FOOTBALL SEASON. I ATTENDED AND WATCHED MANY SPORTING EVENTS AS IS MY HABIT TO THIS DAY. THE CALENDARS SHOW A FEW WEEK DAY GATHERS TO MEET UP AND HAVE DAY GATHERS TO MEET UP AND HAVE SOME BEERS AND WORK OUT. NONE OF THOSE GATHERING INCLUDED NONE OF THOSE GATHERING INCLUDED THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT DR. FORD HAS IDENTIFIED. AND AS MY CALENDARS SHOW, I WAS AND AS MY CALENDARS SHOW, I WAS VERY PRECISE LISTING WHO WAS THERE. VERY PRECISE. AND KEEP IN MIND, MY CALENDARS ALSO ARE DIARIES OF SORTS. FORWARD LOOKING AND BACKWARD LOOKING JUST LIKE MY DAD’S. YOU CAN SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT I YOU CAN SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT I CROSSED OUT MISSED WORKOUTS. THE CANCEL’S DOCTOR’S APPOINTMENTS AND I LISTED THE PRECISE PEOPLE THAT HAD SHOWN UP PRECISE PEOPLE THAT HAD SHOWN UP FOR CERTAIN EVENTS. THE CALENDARS ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT THE CALENDARS ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT DESPOSITIVE ON THEIR HONEY BUT THEY’RE ANOTHER PIECE IN THE EVIDENCE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. FIFTH, DR. FORD’S ALLEGATION IS FIFTH, DR. FORD’S ALLEGATION IS RADICALLY INCONSISTENT WITH MY RECORD AND MY CHARACTER FROM MY RECORD AND MY CHARACTER FROM MY YOUTH TO THE PRESENT DAY. AS STUDENTS AT AN ALL-BOYS CATHOLIC JESUIT SCHOOL, MANY OF CATHOLIC JESUIT SCHOOL, MANY OF US BECAME FRIENDS AND REMAIN FRIENDS TO THIS DAY WITH STUDENTS AT LOCAL CATHOLIC ALL-GIRL SCHOOLS. ONE FEATURE OF MY LIFE THAT HAS ONE FEATURE OF MY LIFE THAT HAS REMAINED TRUE TO THE PRESENT DAY REMAINED TRUE TO THE PRESENT DAY IS THAT I’VE ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF IS THAT I’VE ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF CLOSE FEMALE FRIENDS. I’M NOT TALKING ABOUT GIRLFRIENDS. I’M TALKING ABOUT FRIENDS THAT ARE WOMEN. THAT STARTED IN HIGH SCHOOL. MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE I’M AN ONLY MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE I’M AN ONLY CHILD AND HAD NO SISTERS. BUT WE HAD NO SOCIAL MEDIA OR TEXTS AND E-MAIL AND WE TALKED ON THE PHONE. I REMEMBER TALKING ALMOST EVERY I REMEMBER TALKING ALMOST EVERY NIGHT IT SEEMED MY FRIENDS AMY OR JULIE OR KRISTIN OR KAREN OR OR JULIE OR KRISTIN OR KAREN OR SUZANNE OR MORA OR MEGAN OR NICKI. THE LIST GOES ON. FRIENDS FOR A LIFETIME BUILT ON FRIENDS FOR A LIFETIME BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF TALKING THROUGH A FOUNDATION OF TALKING THROUGH SCHOOL AND LIFE STARTING AT AGE SCHOOL AND LIFE STARTING AT AGE 14. SEVERAL OF THOSE GREAT WOMEN ARE SEVERAL OF THOSE GREAT WOMEN ARE IN THE SEATS BEHIND ME TODAY. MY FRIENDS AND I SOMETIMES GOT TOGETHER AND HAD PARTIES ON WEEKENDS. THE DRINKING AGE WAS 18 IN MARYLAND FOR MOST OF MY TIME IN MARYLAND FOR MOST OF MY TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL AND 18 FOR D.C. ALL HIGH SCHOOL AND 18 FOR D.C. ALL OF MY TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL. I DRANK BEER WITH MY FRIENDS. ALMOST EVERYONE DID. SOMETIMES I HAD TOO MANY BEERS. SOMETIMES OTHERS DID. I LIKED BEER. I STILL LIKE BEER. BUT I DID NOT DRINK TO THE POINT BUT I DID NOT DRINK TO THE POINT OF BLACKING OUT AND I NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ANYONE. THERE’S A BRIGHT LINE BETWEEN DRINKING BEER, WHICH I GLADLY DO DRINKING BEER, WHICH I GLADLY DO AND WHICH I FULLY EMBRACE, AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTING SOMEONE, WHICH IS A VIOLENT CRIME. IF EVERY AMERICAN THAT DRINKS BEER IN HIGH SCHOOL IS SUDDENLY BEER OR EVERY AMERICAN WHO DRANK BEER IN HIGH SCHOOL IS SUDDENLY PRESUMED GUILTY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, WE’LL BE AN UGLY NEW PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY. I NEVER COMMITTED SEXUAL ASSAULT. AS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, WE SOMETIMES DID GOOFY OR STUPID THINGS. I DOUBT WE WERE ALONE IN LOOKING I DOUBT WE WERE ALONE IN LOOKING BACK AT HIGH SCHOOL AND CRINGING BACK AT HIGH SCHOOL AND CRINGING AT SOME THINGS. FOR ONE THING, OUR YEAR BOOK WAS FOR ONE THING, OUR YEAR BOOK WAS A DISASTER. SOME PEOPLE WANTED THE YEAR BOOK SOME PEOPLE WANTED THE YEAR BOOK TO BE A COMBINATION OF ANIMAL HOUSE, CANDY SHACK AND FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, WHICH WERE ALL RECENT MOVIES AT THAT TIME. MANY OF US WENT ALONG IN THE YEAR BOOK TO THE POINT OF ABSURDITY. THIS PAST WEEK, MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE CRINGE ED THIS PAST WEEK, MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE CRINGED WHEN WE READ ABOUT HAVE CRINGED WHEN WE READ ABOUT IT AND TALKED TO EACH OTHER. ONE THING IN PARTICULAR WE’RE SAD ABOUT, ONE OF OUR GOOD ONE OF OUR GOOD FEMALE FRIENDS THAT WE ADMIRE AND WENT TO DANCES WE HAD HER NAME ON THE YEAR BOOK PAGE WITH ALUMNUS. THAT WAS MEANT TO SHOW AFFECTION. IN THIS CIRCUS, THE TERM IS RELATED TO SEX. IT’S NOT RELATED TO SEX. THE WOMAN HERSELF NOTED THE MEDIA ON THE RECORD, SHE AND I NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL INTERACTION NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL INTERACTION AT ALL. SO SORRY TO HER FOR THAT YEAR BOOK REFERENCE. THIS MAY SOUND A BIT TRIVIAL, GIVEN ALL THAT WE’RE HERE FOR, BUT ONE THING I WANT TO TRY TO MAKE SURE OF IN THE FUTURE IS MY MAKE SURE OF IN THE FUTURE IS MY FRIENDSHIP WITH HER. SHE WAS AND IS A GREAT PERSON. AS TO SEX, THIS IS NOT A TOPIC I AS TO SEX, THIS IS NOT A TOPIC I EVER IMAGINED WOULD COME UP AT A EVER IMAGINED WOULD COME UP AT A JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION HEARING. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A FULL PICTURE OF WHO I WAS. I NEVER HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE OR ANYTHING CLOSE TO IT DURING HIGH SCHOOL OR FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THAT. SOME CROWDS I WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE OUTWARDLY SHY ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE. TRIED TO HIDE THAT. THE SAME TIME I WAS ALSO INWARDLY PROUD OF IT. FOR ME AND THE GIRLS THAT I WAS FOR ME AND THE GIRLS THAT I WAS FRIENDS WITH, THAT LACK OF MAJOR FRIENDS WITH, THAT LACK OF MAJOR OR RAMPANT SEXUAL ACTIVITY IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS A MATTER OF FAITH AND RESPECT AND CAUTION. THE COMMITTEE HAS A LETTER FROM THE COMMITTEE HAS A LETTER FROM 65 WOMEN THAT KNEW ME IN HIGH SCHOOL. THEM WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. THEY SAID THAT I ALWAYS TREATED THAT LETTER CAME TOGETHER IN ONE THAT LETTER CAME TOGETHER IN ONE NIGHT 35 YEARS AFTER GRADUATION NIGHT 35 YEARS AFTER GRADUATION WHILE A SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATION WAS PENDING AGAINST ME IN A VERY FRAUGHT AND PUBLIC ME IN A VERY FRAUGHT AND PUBLIC SITUATION WHERE THEY KNEW THEY KNEW THEY WOULD BE VILLIFIED IF KNEW THEY WOULD BE VILLIFIED IF THEY DEFENDED ME.
