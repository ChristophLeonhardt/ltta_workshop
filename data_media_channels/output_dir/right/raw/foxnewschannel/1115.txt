1
00:00:01,016 --> 00:00:02,784
GOVERNOR THINKS MORE TRUMP LEADS

2
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:05,487
TO MORE WINNING FOR HIS PARTY.

3
00:00:05,487 --> 00:00:07,089
PLEASE COME CAMPAIGN FOR HIM AS

4
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:10,292
MUCH AS POSSIBLE, HE SAYS,

5
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:11,059
EARLIER TODAY.

6
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:15,797
I SAT DOWN WITH NEWT GINGRICH,

7
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:19,067
AND TALKED ABOUT HIS BOOK,

8
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:22,270
"TRUMP AMERICA, THE TRUTH ABOUT

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,306
THE NATIONS COME BACK."

10
00:00:24,306 --> 00:00:26,274
WHAT IMPACT IS TRUMP HAVING ON

11
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:27,409
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?

12
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:30,579
>> HE'S MOVING TO A MUCH MORE

13
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:32,848
PRO-JOBS, PRO-GROWTH,

14
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:35,117
RECOMMITTING LIKE, ALMOST LIKE A

15
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:37,319
REAGAN LIKE COMMITMENT.

16
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:43,692
HE'S BEEN BRINGING ON MORE

17
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:44,659
CONSERVATIVE JUDGES.

18
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:47,295
BUT HE IS VERY AGGRESSIVE, HE'S

19
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:50,732
A GENUINE POPULIST IN THE SENSE

20
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:53,869
THAT, I THINK HE FOCUSES ON THE

21
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:56,004
HARDWORKING, BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS

22
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:58,073
WHO HISTORICALLY MADE AMERICA

23
00:00:58,073 --> 00:00:58,807
SUCH A REMARKABLE COUNTRY, AND

24
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:00,575
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

25
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:01,676
GET A GOOD DEAL.

26
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:04,279
THAT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN A

27
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:04,780
REPUBLICAN MODEL.

28
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,348
>> Sandra: I KNOW IN YOUR BOOK

29
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:08,583
YOU LIST THE ACCOMPANIMENTS OF

30
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,684
THIS PRESIDENCY SO FAR.

31
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:11,520
WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRIMARIES,

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,289
LIKE WE SAW LAST NIGHT, AND JOHN

33
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:16,324
COX, ARE YOU GETTING THE SENSE

34
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:18,126
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

35
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:20,896
FEELING THE BENEFITS OF THIS

36
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,463
PRESIDENT'S POLICIES?

37
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:23,298
BEFORE I THINK THERE ARE TWO

38
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:25,500
DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON.

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,935
AMONG REPOT DONE LIKE

40
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:28,136
REPUBLICANS, HE'S PROBABLY THE

41
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:31,973
MOST POPULAR PRESIDENT AT THIS

42
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:32,574
STAGE OF ANY REPUBLICAN.

43
00:01:32,574 --> 00:01:33,575
IT'S REMARKABLE THE NUMBERS.

44
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:37,579
EVEN MORE SUBSTANTIALLY POPULAR

45
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,215
THAN REAGAN WAS.

46
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:41,583
I THINK THAT THE INDEPENDENCE

47
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:45,654
AND THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVEN'T

48
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:49,491
DRUNK THE KOOL-AID, WHEN YOU

49
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:51,026
HAVE THE LOWEST BLACK

50
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:52,460
UNEMPLOYMENT IN HISTORY, WHEN

51
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,728
YOU LITERALLY HAVE IT YESTERDAY

52
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:55,497
AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THERE ARE

53
00:01:55,497 --> 00:01:59,367
MORE JOBS THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE

54
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:00,368
LOOKING FOR WORK, WHEN YOU HAVE

55
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:01,570
THE FEDERAL RESERVE SAYING THAT

56
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,172
THIS QUARTER MIGHT BE A 4.8%

57
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:07,642
GROWTH FOR THE ECONOMY, WHICH

58
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:09,176
WOULD BE A RONALD RAGAN LEVEL

59
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:09,877
NUMBER.

60
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:11,279
TWO YEARS AGO, PEOPLE WERE

61
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:14,282
TELLING US, YOU WILL NEVER GET

62
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:14,883
ABOVE 2%.

63
00:02:14,883 --> 00:02:17,185
THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL.

64
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:19,087
WELL, WE BLEW UP THE NEW NORMAL.

65
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:20,722
AND DONALD TRUMP, I THINK HE

66
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:23,058
GETS UP EVERY DAY, AND ABOUT

67
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:27,262
HALF OF HIS FOCUS IS JOBS.

68
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:29,030
>> Sandra: SPEAKER, WITH ALL

69
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,666
THIS TALK OF THE BLUE WAVE, DO

70
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,103
YOU AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT, IS

71
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:37,606
IT A RED WAVE?

72
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:44,079
>> THERE ARE GOING TO GAIN

73
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,547
BETWEEN TWO AND SIX SEATS IN THE

74
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:47,349
SENATE.

75
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:48,884
WE WILL PROBABLY GAIN SEATS IN

76
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:49,451
GOVERNORSHIPS.

77
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:51,286
THE ONLY PLACE THAT YOU CAN

78
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:54,890
ARGUE IS THE HOUSE, AND FRANKLY,

79
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,324
COX BEING ON THE BALLOT IN

80
00:02:56,324 --> 00:02:57,392
CALIFORNIA IS AN ENORMOUS ASSET

81
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:59,561
FOR US KEEPING THE SEEDS IN

82
00:02:59,561 --> 00:02:59,961
CALIFORNIA.

83
00:02:59,961 --> 00:03:02,664
IF WE KEEP ALL OF OUR SEATS IN

84
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:05,901
CALIFORNIA, THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY

85
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:06,568
GET TO A MAJORITY.

86
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:07,736
>> Sandra: IT REMARKABLY.

87
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:10,906
I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON

88
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:11,840
THIS, SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,341
MUELLER REPORTEDLY ASKING

90
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:15,343
WITNESSES FOR THEIR PERSONAL

91
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:17,279
CELL PHONES IN ORDER TO GET

92
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,480
INFORMATION OFF OF SOME

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,080
ENCRYPTED APPS.

94
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,783
THAT COMES TWO DAYS AFTER QUOTE

95
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:23,285

98
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:29,291
BY USING THESE ENCRYPTED APPS ON

99
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,292
HIS PHONE.

100
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,359
APPARENTLY FORGETTING THAT

101
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:33,361
ROBERT MUELLER HAD A WARRANT TO

102
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:36,364
MONITOR HIS iCLOUD ACCOUNT.

103
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:40,435
OOPS, HE FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

104
00:03:40,435 --> 00:03:42,470
>> Newt: I THOUGHT HE WAS

105
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,471
SMARTER THAN THAT.

106
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:45,140
THE FACT IS IF YOU ARE IN THIS

107
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,474
KIND OF INVESTIGATION, THE

108
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:48,076
GOVERNMENT HAS THE POWER TO GET

109
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:49,110
TO THE INFORMATION.

110
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,812
IF YOU TRY TO HIDE IT, THEY HAVE

111
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:52,380
THE POWER TO MAKE YOU TURN IT

112
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,515
OVER UNLESS YOU PLEAD THE FIFTH

113
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:56,384
AMENDMENT AND YOU END UP IN A

114
00:03:56,384 --> 00:04:00,088
SITUATION WHERE YOU REFUSE TO

115
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:01,289
TESTIFY.

116
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:03,491
THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE, YOU

117
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:05,026
CAN'T SAY TO PEOPLE, I WANT ALL

118
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:07,162

119
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:08,296
