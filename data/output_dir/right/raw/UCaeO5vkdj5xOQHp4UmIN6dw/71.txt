00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,480
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ranks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to become the fire</font>

chief and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then he was hired by Obama</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,630
run<font color="#CCCCCC"> a division of FEMA and then he was</font>

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,609
recruited back to Atlanta<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

9

fire department was struggling<font color="#CCCCCC"> in his</font>

10
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">absence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so this was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very sought-after</font>

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago mr. Cochran</font>

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,120
wrote a short devotional book about his

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,120
Christian<font color="#E5E5E5"> faith in which he mentioned</font>

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that marriage according to</font>

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,020
the Bible is between a<font color="#E5E5E5"> man and a woman</font>

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,340
and I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this was something</font>

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,050
that he mentioned only<font color="#E5E5E5"> on like one page</font>

19
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,539
of the book I'm pretty sure he shared
