how much cognitive dissonance does it take to tweet I don't hate Jews I hate Zionists just seven minutes after saying when Palestine is returned just know there will be no mercy whatsoever every last Jew will die I'm gonna go with maybe this much let's take a look I've been covering recently how Texas which people view as the lifeblood of free speech Second Amendment rights pretty much everything that makes America America is also a hotbed of anti feh activism but the state seems to be home to some of the most virulent anti-israel activists as well the dude who said he doesn't hate Jews seven minutes after saying every last Jew will die his University of Texas at Arlington student Malik Abraham Malik is part of UT Arlington's Muslim Students Association and went on to say the Jews that do live will be swallowed by us we will marry their daughters and there will only be Muslim Arabs and a few weeks later he celebrated the use decision to take Hamas off of its terrorism list but Malik isn't an isolated case of pro palestinian radicalism at UT Arlington Dana Omar then vice president of the school stews students for justice in Palestine said Hamas are freedom fighters not terrorists this was during the 2014 Israel Gaza conflict which started when Hamas kidnapped and murdered three Israeli teens if that's not a terrorist act I'm not quite sure what is another UT Arlington student and fellow Muslim Students Association member norsu dad really likes her Arabic using it to tweet Allah will curse the father of the Jews and apparently screamed the homes of the Jews be destroyed there's also a mod Hajj mahute who tweeted Palestine is our land and the Jews are our dogs and of course UT Arlington graduate l homme Lange Groody who compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Hitler finally there's Nancy celeb who was a UT Arlington SJP activist but not students who got fired from her job teaching two-year-olds after tweets including phrases like kill some Jews and gassed a Jew you know a lot of people treat the israeli-palestinian conflict as a nuanced issue and it is but if you want your side of the argument to be taken seriously this is not how you do it for campus unmasked I'm Rob Jim Shaw if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
