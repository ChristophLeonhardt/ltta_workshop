now a space mission which was already shrouded in secrecy in the US has now grown even more mysterious now amid rumors about the fate of a classified government satellite will the reusable SpaceX rocket which launched it safely returned to earth questions are being raised over what happened to its payload well art easily Petrenko joins me now live in the studio to discuss this further now ilio what do we know so far Biggi hello well the intriguing or mysterious thing about this is that ahead of the launch in during it and the media there were so many stories about the top-secret spy satellite which belongs to the US government being launched by Elon Musk's SpaceX company it was called Zuma but now almost two days after the launch everyone is pretty much in the dark about its fate Sunday night's launch was live-streamed by SpaceX but only until a certain stage we have had successful liftoff of Falcon 9 carrying Zuma though then the satellites deployment into orbit wasn't shown or reported on at all no if the mission is so secretive isn't it only fed at some stages off the livestream wouldn't be censored well on the one hand it is true and we know that the usual practice for this kind of limited access to the stream is like that for missions of that secretive nature but then neither SpaceX nor the manufacture of the satellite confirmed that the launch was successful and this led to the first doubts appearing other reasons to think that something possibly may have gone wrong here then two respected news organizations in the US Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reported that Zuma may have fallen back to earth or burnt in the planet's atmosphere and when they get that classified information from anonymous sources within the US government and also the industry what they did as they requested comment from the Pentagon from the satellites manufacturer and of course from Elon Musk's company as well and this is what they got we have nothing to add to the satellite Cadillac at this time we cannot comment on classified missions we do not comment on missions of this nature but as of right now reviews of the data indicate Falcon 9 performed nominally so where did these comments or rather no comment replies leave us well let's assume that the mission was at the end of the day success does that mean that there is so much secrecy behind this spy satellite that no one is entitled to know about this mission and again why can't we see any updates in that US government satellite catalog so there are of course questions what's the actual function on the set of the satellite why is it so mysterious who is it going to spy on and to what extent is this kind of spying serious on the other hand if it was indeed a failure perhaps that's not going to be a disaster for the reputation of SpaceX and Elon Musk's Enterprise but definitely it is going to be an image problem and it will affect the way he does business with the US government we know that his next step for the company is to start sending manned missions into space and questions will be asked about that when things like that are basically happening months before the first instances of such launches are to be seen in the US and indeed the logger is left with no official comments the more intrigue and mystery there is so le petrenko thanks for coming in
