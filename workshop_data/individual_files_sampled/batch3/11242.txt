spain has become the biggest receiver of migrants that have crossed the Mediterranean welcoming almost 30,000 people just this year on Thursday 87 asylum seekers docked in the southern Spanish port of Algeciras but the local mayor claims that the city doesn't have the resources to cope with the new arrivals we were not informed of anything as mayor I have to ensure citizens interests and I don't want social imbalance here the Spanish have big hearts yes but on this issue we have to use our heads because there is not enough money over 23 thousand refugees came to Spain by sea this year the massive inflow has sparked concern among people in the capital as well we need to take more measures to help this migrants in their countries of origin bodies compete with each other such grandstanding it's all about politics they're simply playing with people nobody modified we can't let these people simply die in the sea but this has been happening for a long time we'll let these things happen again and again on Saturday a new migrant deal between Spain and Germany comes into force under the agreement refugees travelling from Spain can be returned there within 48 hours of arrival at the German border here's how the German Interior Minister described the deal thus what did he call it the German governing coalition wants a procedure with the main affected countries to negotiate the process of repatriation of migrants I hope that soon we will get some clarity and see if it works out in the end the German people would not understand if we took in more refugees than we sent back this wouldn't fly politically the president of the far-right Spanish party respeto claims the country blindly follows any orders from Germany acuerdo symbolic o simplemente para la barra the only purpose of this symbolic agreement is to help merkel save face before her own government which is in trouble right now and of course Spain is going to obediently take whatever Merkel throws at us Europe cannot accept any more migrants every week we see problems plaguing Spanish cities all because there's no way to control the inflow of migrants and because there's no way to give jobs to the newcomers all the while thousands of skilled Spanish people are leaving the country every month we're not providing them with opportunities we made the biggest mistake a nation can make we have forsaken our own children to take in others you
