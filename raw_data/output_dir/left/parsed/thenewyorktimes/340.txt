The State of the
Union address has
been televised since Harry
Truman was president.
“What we do or fail to do 
at home affects
not only ourselves, 
but millions throughout the world.”
But it was Ronald
Reagan who understood
how to make the event
appeal to a wider audience.
His secret weapon: 
Lenny Skutnik.
On a freezing January
day in 1982,
Lenny Skutnik dived
into the Potomac River
to save a survivor
of a plane crash.
Television cameras immortalized
the heroic act.
About a month later,
Skutnik sat in Congress
next to the first lady
and Reagan pointed him out
for those watching his State
of the Union address from home.
“Just two weeks ago,
in the midst 
of a terrible tragedy
on the Potomac,
we saw again, 
the spirit of American
heroism at its finest.”
Skutnik was an everyman.
People could relate to him.
And his dramatic rescue also
satisfied America’s hunger
for storytelling.
His fame soon faded,
but his legacy endures.
Reagan
successors continue
to invite unsung heroes
to their addresses.
These special
guests, often called
‘Lenny Skutniks,’ have ranged
from civil rights advocates ...
“When a woman named
Rosa Parks sat
down on a bus in Alabama.”
... to everyday heroes.
“Jackie Bray
is a single mom from North
Carolina who was laid off
from her job as a mechanic.”
But in recent years
guests have taken
a more partisan role like former
Afghan interim leader Hamid
Karzai in 2002.
Or an empty seat left 
for victims of gun violence in 2016.
As with most things in
Washington, who will be invited
is steeped in politics
as presidents sometimes
use guests as symbols
of their own policies.
