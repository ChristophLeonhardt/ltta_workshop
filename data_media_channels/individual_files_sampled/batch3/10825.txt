staying with Israel - next it's reached an agreement with the UN refugee agency to send more than 16,000 African migrants to Western countries a previous plan to return them to safer countries in Africa floundered badly it's a unique agreement with the State of Israel which removes sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty people out of Israel two developed countries such as Canada Germany and Italy now this comes after under-the-radar talks that resulted in a new plan being put forward that plan was put together by the Israeli government the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other interested parties it scraps a previous plan that the Israeli government was planning to carry out and that would have seen refugees in this country being presented with one of two options on the one hand they would have to agree to be deported to a third African country there was a sweetener of $3,500 per refugee as well as a plane ticket but however if they refused that they would then have to face the option of prison now that plan was was refuted by human rights groups by thousands of Israelis who for the past few months have been taking to the streets to protest against it Netanyahu now saying that their plan is no longer feasible because of legal constraints and political difficulties what we understand now moving forward is that it will be the responsibility of the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner to find homes and look after these refugees who are being sent to Western countries and in addition another 18,000 will remain legally inside this country now Germany and Italy or both countries that are already favored destinations for Refugees if you look at the figures from last year for example Germany registered more than a hundred and eighty six thousand refugees and Italy in the same time period so 120,000 refugees arriving on its shores via boat so those are countries that already are facing the problems of refugees and now they have the additional refugee numbers that are being sent to them from Israel so no doubt they will have more responsibility and more challenges moving forward
