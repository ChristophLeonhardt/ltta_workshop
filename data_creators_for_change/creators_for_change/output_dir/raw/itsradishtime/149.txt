1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,929
So, here’s the deal

2
00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:04,880
I want to know, what makes you feel powerful.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,170
I guess that’s a fairly recent discovery
of mine, is that powerful is a human emotion

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,040
that is available to me in an array of feels
that I can feel.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,040
I mean it takes awhile to get there right?

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,520
But then one day, you’re just say, in a
meeting at work and you’re saying intelligent

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,100
things with conviction, and people are LISTENING
to you and you’re like YEEEEESSSSS

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,520
It’s a feeling I am really into, but it
doesn’t happen all so often spontaneously,

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,890
so here are a few things I have found that
help me fake it.

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,890
1.

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,890
Choose a few role models.

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,920
It can be anyone you want, absolutely anyone.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,940
But just have some people you can call upon
in times of weakness.

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,960
I personally like to summon the strength of
Ruth Bader Ginsburg combined with the spirit

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:53,010
of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler doing the Bitches
get stuff done bit on weekend update, encapsulated

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,820
in the essence of Nicki Minaj’s verse in
Monster and it takes me to a place.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,820
2.

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,410
Don a power outfit.

19
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,349
whatever makes you feel your most badass.

20
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:10,029
I don’t care if it’s glitter unicorn space
princess or lumberjack chic, or health goth

21
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,200
or what have you.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,060
I like to dress like I am not to be fucked
with ™. All black clothing.

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,060
Combat boots.

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,390
Winged eyeliner.

25
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,390
YES Even to work.

26
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:26,549
This may not be appropriate in all schools
or office environments but I am the consummate

27
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,799
professional in the body of an minimalist,
boyish goth queen.

28
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,030
3.

29
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,950
Choose a theme song.

30
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:44,520
For me, a power jam requires two things: all
kinds of drum and bass, and usually, some

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,219
gravely-voiced white dude shouting about things.

32
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,219
Case in point.

33
00:01:48,219 --> 00:02:19,530
When I get all of those things together I
feel like I can take on the world.

34
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,299
But I wanna know what makes YOU feel like
you’re ten feet tall and capable of anything.

35
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:25,299
Comments!

36
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:28,820
I’m also going to link a playlist of my
favorite power jams.

37
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,819
In the comments, tell me what yours are, so
I can add them to my list.

38
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:39,160
Twitter, Tumblr, and instagram in the links
below.

39
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,830
I’ll see you next week.

40
00:02:40,830 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!
