1
00:00:00,035 --> 00:00:03,243
GET RID OF THE NORTH KOREA NUKES

2
00:00:03,243 --> 00:00:06,041
IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

3
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:07,698
GREG IS LIVE IN SEOUL, SOUTH

4
00:00:07,698 --> 00:00:10,149
KOREA.

5
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:20,605
>> ALL RIGHT, TRACE.

6
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:21,361
>> ALL RIGHT, TRACE.

7
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:23,263
CHBLS OH HARD-HEADED THINKING

8
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:25,188
ABOUT THE STATEMENTS MADE.

9
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:28,015
FOR EXAMPLE, DENUCLEARIZATION,

10
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:29,769
THAT HAS BEEN POINTED ABOUT AND

11
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,192
PROMISED BY NORTH KOREA IN THE

12
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:32,467
PAST AND NORTH KOREA HAS GONE

13
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:34,185
BACK ON IT.

14
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:36,448
ALSO, THE STATEMENT MADE ON

15
00:00:36,448 --> 00:00:37,201
FRIDAY, WAS PAINFULLY SHORT ON

16
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:38,981
DETAILS.

17
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:41,176
THE TIME FRAME, HOW THEY WOULD

18
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:42,778
GET RID OF THE NUKES AND

19
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:43,453
MISSILES AND WHAT COULD BE

20
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:45,985
VERIFIED.

21
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:48,487
TO THAT POINT A LOT OF PEOPLE

22
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:50,739
ASKING ABOUT THAT, INCLUDING THE

23
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:51,740
OPPOSITION PARTY HERE TO

24
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,392
PRESIDENT MOON WHO THINKS HE'S

25
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:54,089
GETTING TOO CLOSE TO NORTH

26
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:54,996
KOREA.

27
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:57,492
EVEN AMONG THE SKEPTICS AND

28
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:00,495
AFTER-GLOW OF THE SUMMIT THERE'S

29
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:02,597
THE BROAD MAJORITY OPINION IS

30
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:05,156
LET'S WAIT AND SEE AND HOPE.

31
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:05,456
TRACE?

32
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:06,506
>> Trace: YES, IT WASN'T TOO

33
00:01:06,506 --> 00:01:08,359
LONG AGO, GREG, WE TALKED ABOUT

34
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,660
THIS, THERE WAS THE NAME CALLING

35
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,112
AND NORTH KOREA WAS THREATENING

36
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,707
THE U.S. AND TESTING MISSILES.

37
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:14,509
THAT WAS JUST, WHAT, BACK IN THE

38
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,690
LATTER PART OF LAST YEAR.

39
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,188
>> ABSOLUTELY.

40
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:20,816
THE IRONY OF THE SETTING, FOR

41
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:23,023
EXAMPLE, ISN'T LOST ON ANYONE.

42
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:27,322
THE PEACE HOUSE, THE PEACE TALKS

43
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:30,731
IN PAN MOON JANG, THE JOINT

44
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:33,734
SECURITY AREA, DMZ, LAST

45
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:35,885
DECEMBER WAS A NASTY SHOOTOUT

46
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:40,811
WITH THE NORTH KOREAN SOLDIER

47
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:42,743
FLEEING HIS OWN ARMY, WE'VE SEEN

48
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:43,492
THE BULLET HOLE WHERE HE WENT

49
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:45,314
DOWN.

50
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,449
THAT'S WHERE TWO LEADERS WERE

51
00:01:47,449 --> 00:01:48,649
WALKING AND TALKING TODAY.

52
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:50,952
AS YOU KNOW, JUST LAST YEAR, WE

53
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:53,054
WITNESSED MULTIPLE MISSILE

54
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:55,156
LAUNCHES FROM NORTH KOREA, ALSO,

55
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,408
THAT NUCLEAR TEST.

56
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,353
CERTAINLY, A LOT OF TOUGH

57
00:01:58,353 --> 00:02:00,028
LANGUAGE ON THE U.S. SIDE, TOO.

58
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:01,210
TRACE, IT IS EARLY SATURDAY

59
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,113
MORNING HERE.

60
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:04,759
I THINK WITH THE HEAD SPINNING

61
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,161
AND ALL OF THE TALK AND ALL OF

62
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:09,370
THE ACTION, I THINK SOUTH KOREA

63
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,872
MAYBE IN THE REGION MIGHT WANT

64
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:12,271
TO TAKE A WEEKEND OFF AND CHEW

65
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:13,020
ON THIS THING AND HOPE FOR THE

66
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,346
BEST.

67
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:14,847
BACK TO YOU.

68
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:16,727
>> Trace: AND, GREG, WE'LL HEAR

69
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:18,029
COMMENTS FROM THE PRESIDENT ON

70
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:19,730
NORTH KOREA IN ABOUT 45 SECONDS,

71
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,976
I MIGHT CUT YOU OFF.

72
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:21,877
WHILE I HAVE YOU STILL, I WANT

73
00:02:21,877 --> 00:02:23,884
TO GET A FEEL.

74
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:24,980
THIS STILL HAS TO BE VERY

75
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,182
HOPEFUL FOR THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH

76
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:29,239
KREE, A IT HAS TO BUOY THEM.

77
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:30,141
IT COULD FALL APART IN 10

78
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:31,486
MINUTES.

79
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:34,043
BUT THEY HAVE TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT

80
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:34,644
THE STEPS IN THE RIGHT

81
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:35,645
DIRECTION.

82
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:36,591
QUICKLY, GREG.

83
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,493
>> ABSOLUTELY.

84
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,851
THEY ARE THINKING THAT IT IS A

85
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:42,097
GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT

86
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:42,474
DIRECTION.

87
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:43,722
THEY WANT IT TO WORK.

88
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:45,474
THEY A ARE HOPING FOR THE BEST.

89
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:47,302
THEY LIVE IN SHADOW, NOT JUST OF

90
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:49,113
THE NUCLEAR THREAT, THE

91
00:02:49,113 --> 00:02:50,976
MISSILES, BUT ALSO ARTILLERIES

92
00:02:50,976 --> 00:00:00,000
PLACED JUST ABOUT 30 MILES AWAY
