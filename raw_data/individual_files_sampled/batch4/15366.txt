if you wanna be a drag queen and your parents don't let you you need new parents lots of you will recognize this image which was making the rounds on social media lately it's a disco onesie modeled by an 8 year old boy called Nemus known to his fans by his drag name lacked Asia liked Asia was first thrust into the public eye when she appeared on stage with drag race winner Bianca Del Rio she recently also appeared in a video for Elcom joined by her mother and another dragster vivacious who also appeared in RuPaul's Drag Race there you go diva in the makin I love it it's because of people like you that I'm here you are my replacement the controversy was largely down to the fact that most people feel uncomfortable seeing a child looking and behaving like an adult but upon further inspection it was soon discovered that the clothing line the house of man owned by designers Brandon Hilton also sells fetish clothing such as PVC underwear body harnesses and nipple tassels people just aren't accepting of it right now but these kids know themselves they're sure of themselves they pick their outfits they do their makeup and I think it's beautiful that they're able to be themselves after 4chan users began sharing the image it was swiftly picked up by members of the alternative media who criticized the mother and the designer for including a child model alongside erotic adult images I come from a slightly different angle on this because I actually like drag drag has been a big part of my life now for a few years old drag was about mocking the taboo and about finding the beauty in the movie ochre and the vulgar it plays with femininity using morbid gallows humor drag combines dance theatre comedy and fashion however drag also plays with adult themes its lewd humor and a lot of innuendo but it doesn't come from the same place for a child a child just want to dress up go on TV give interviews and meet their idols instant fame can bring with it many positives however time has proven that child stars are pray to God knows who in Hollywood I was surrounded by them when I was 14 years old surrounded literally didn't even know it it wasn't until I was old enough to realize what they were and what they wanted and what they were about and the types of people that were surrounding me until I went oh my god they were everywhere like vultures it's this reason that I actually quite liked the hashtag time's up because in my opinion time should be up for that sort of stuff and I love watching Hollywood burn but moving on let's look at some drag history so 1990s documentary Paris is burning tells the story of the ball culture in New York around the mid to late 80s this film is an absolute must watch to understand the history of the drag world and it wasn't just about dresses and heels part of the culture is how well you could pass as a member of high society in a ball rolling you can be anything you want you're not really an executive but you're looking like an executive and therefore your story in the straight world that I can be an executive if I had the opportunity I could be one and many of you will recognize these quotes that you can still hear drag queens saying today they come from this film and from this time she is I don't tell you ugly but I don't have to tell you because you know and that's shade many of the children that is the younger drag queens were rejected by their biological parents because of their sexuality and in many cases they were kicked out onto the streets where they turned to shoplifting and even sex work in order to survive eventually being adopted by a house and a mother who took them in and made them feel welcome underneath the glitz and the glamour it is a world full of poverty broken families addiction and even murder Dorian quarry the older drag queen who preaches heavily in the films kept a mummified corpse in her apartment for an untold amount of years shot in the head wrapped in fake leather and stuffed into a suitcase and the body was only discovered after her death Venus Xtravaganza who wanted to become the fully transgendered woman was murdered before the film had finished production on Christmas Day in 1988 venus was found strangled under a bed in the duchess hotel in new york i always found this scene uncomfortable as well with these two young boys out on the streets how old are you 13 and you out here - Thomas if we honor your mom and why are you down here we should mother you know I don't have a mother everybody has a mother we wouldn't be where's your mother this is why I'm so skeptical about introducing children into this world it's a bit like vaping we don't know whether it's good or bad yet it's a bit of an experiment and we might not see the results for decades by which time it might be too late take Katia for example Katia is one of the most successful RuPaul's Drag Race contestants she co-hosts her own show with Trixie Mattel and in my opinion is one of the funnier drag queens but recently she released this statement hi my name is not Katia my name is Brian I'm a recovering drug addict and a workaholic I need to take some personal time for my mental health to heal and recover I hope Brian sources head out and I wish him all the best in his recovery but see it's not all glitz and glamour even at the top another famous drag queen star is Desmond is amazing Desmond first made the rounds online after videos of him twerking at a gay pride parade in Brooklyn went viral at just 10 Desmond has been blessed by RuPaul has given speeches at lgbtq+ events and has even won an award for his activism hundreds of thousands of people have voiced their opinion about Desmond that's a lot to deal with for a ten-year-old some have compared him to Jon Benet the famous child pageant queen who was found strangled to death in her homes which is interesting child pageants have often been a topic of debate Rose the drag queen kids are seemingly off-limits one of the main concerns is not necessarily the pageants themselves but the people who might be watching them for the wrong reasons take for example Alaska Mathews Alaska's mother was widely criticized after images of the child appeared on an inappropriate website this was beyond pageant the fact is you allowed a post from a man saying he to freeze frames of my daughter from the TV show yeah Desmond has recently launched a drag Club for kids called the house of amazing with the intention of allowing drag children to talk to each other and make friends online he's also being photographed with and endorsed by Michael alig and James of James Michael and James are known largely for the film party monster which is based on the 1999 mmm disco bloodbath a fabulous but true tale of murdering clubland written by James and James the film is based on a series of true events surrounding the club kids of the late eighties in the early 90s we follow the tale of how Michael Alec became the king of the club kids through hosting controversial nights on the New York Square scene you can still find footage of a young Michael and even a young RuPaul on TV shows such as Geraldo and Joan Rivers but the story takes a turn for the worst when Michael and his friend Robert Riggs murder an acquaintance of theirs over a dispute about drug money they then stored the body in a bathtub in the apartment until it began to decompose and Michael agreed to dismember it in exchange for 10 bags of heroin now alec is out of prison after serving a 17-year sentence and he seems to be trying to better himself and move on from his past he's also a supporter of Desmond calling him the world's youngest club kid Desmond even appeared as a guest on michael alig's YouTube show over Christmas again receiving a mixed reaction while I'm sure the teams and the drag queens surrounding these photoshoots and these children are very protective and wouldn't want them to come into harm's way the truth is that whether you like it or not some people are going to be looking at them in a very different light you cannot control your audience and a lot of these monsters are hidden in plain sight in the fashion world there's also an open secret that if young models do certain things with certain people they can get rewarded with high fashion campaigns so while I understand that this may seem like a load of fuss about children playing dress-up I think it's also fair for the parents to be able to listen to the concerns that people are raising about their children we're not all hateful bigoted lots of us just care about the younger generation and know enough about psychology to be unsettled by this very new and very fast developing movement it reminds me of the quote from Jurassic Park you're so preoccupied about thinking and whether or not you could that you didn't stop to think about whether or not you should you only get one chance to raise your child right don't fuck it up you
