1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,990
I think ever since Peace<font color="#E5E5E5"> Corps it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,960
like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like really like something</font>

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,279
you have to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to make it</font>

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like nobody can do it</font>

5
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">for you and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like knowing what it</font>

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,820
is that you're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your body</font>

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,650
like what are you eating what goes into

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,260
making what you really like it's just

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,329
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so like finicky with yeah so</font>

10
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,239
like how you stir how hard you stir and

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,230
you heated up to 90 degrees<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's always</font>

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,610
amazing to me how like 90<font color="#CCCCCC"> degrees sounds</font>

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,450
hot but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just like lukewarm one time</font>

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,120
I was making this in the thermometer i

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,989
was using was not working and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

16
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,760
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out what 90 degrees was</font>

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,489
by taking my temperature I'm like seeing

18
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,820
if I could feel like under my tongue if

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,670
that was as warm as the mouth that was

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,470
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I failed do you really only</font>

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,020
probably learn by failure what you're

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,119
doing is you're adding an asset<font color="#CCCCCC"> to milk</font>

23
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,020
which is you know essentially curdles it

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,670
but you want to have more control over

25
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,250
it so like whisking it in when you're

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,810
pouring the milk is really important

27
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,850
otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll curdle right then and</font>

28
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,830
then stirring while you're doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

29
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,390
just mixing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it thoroughly so that it</font>

30
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,030
slowly curdles it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cool</font>

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,070
because it really makes me think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

32
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,680
who the first person that discovered

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,870
do this like how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do it it's</font>

34
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,910
like mind-blowing because it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

35
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,560
you have to like heat it to a

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,630
temperature and like do all of these

37
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,570
steps and who like just by happenstance

38
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,430
that figured this out I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Susie</font>

39
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,580
and that's how I think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into like</font>

40
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,190
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that I end up trying to</font>

41
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">make is just like pure curiosity but</font>

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,510
it's also like fun to learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

43
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,850
new things I could knew that you could

44
00:02:05,850 --> 00:00:00,000
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> geez</font>
