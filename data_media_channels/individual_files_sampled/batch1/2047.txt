give it a little juice I will way and I'm Graham Flanagan and we drove this Tesla Model S across the United States our goal to get from San Francisco to New York City in just seven days which meant a lot of driving and a lot of charging we relied exclusively on Tesla's nationwide network of supercharger stations this is what happened when we drove a Tesla across America navigate to Las Vegas Nevada so with the carton that's already on yeah the cars on you wouldn't think so cuz it's so quiet right on Franklin Street we're doing this Wow it's been literally 5:00 a.m. we have Williams but we have driven for five minutes and I'm already getting sick so now we're finally out of that San Francisco traffic and able to really open up and see what this thing does I'm gonna go down to about 45 or so which might piss some people up but man when it's time to go about to go you feel it baby oh it's so awesome this thing has power power you don't do a lot about it I'm scared too let's do that well we're on like a curve we run like a ravine okay okay take you take your time yeah you take it what's your rush man oh I'm just gonna be I'm just holding this camera okay here we go back back all right now I'm going it's going wow that's crazy like I'm not I'm not steering this car right now look I'm gonna take over though because you got scare of an emerging lane and I don't trust this thing yet to change lights everything you're taught and you know growing up learning to drive is to be in control at all times so be in control of your vehicle because when you lose control bad things happen and so when you give this computer control over the car it's like wow I don't have control and you automatically feel vulnerable you know I'm like super used to it now seriously so you're saying it only took you about like just a couple of hours here driving to get used to a lot of oh yeah see now also with switching lanes like I just hit the right turn signal and it just automatically takes you over I didn't like I just did nothing there I didn't know accelerating no steering so you know I'm totally comfortable with that now it's really it's really fun so it's the supercharging 50 minutes to continue on your trip well what do you want to do down there I might catch some Z's man yeah this okay so we've run into our first problem we get this alert this is door ajar door ajar even though all the doors fairly close this door the passenger-side door will not close it opens fine but when you close it it's supposed to kind of lock and engage as you'll see it goes in it comes back out it's not closing properly it's not like just a normal car door you just close it and that's it and we can't proceed when the door is ajar it's like an alarm and just goes and goes and goes so we're stuck yeah when we try and close it you know how it sort of engages and closes and totally latches and closes flush it does that but then it immediately pops back out and the door remains closed but it's not flush so what I just did was I turned that mechanical rotating latch again again like into the the door itself like with so first fix itself alright after two hours of waiting and just like getting on the phone with tehsil reps we finally got the door to closed by itself all right let's get the hell out of here yeah let's do it all right I'm driving a little juice that's awesome I feel like the diesel now you are too fast I'm going too fast that's on me that's my phone wow that was a long trip 12:30 a.m. local Las Vegas time man finally here and we're rolling in this is my first time here in Vegas we're serving Vegas ever ever seen this in person Wow it's funny because we're you know we're in a beautiful Tesla now and I'm like bitching about it and not being able to do that something that people in a Honda Civic could do today so this car is supposed to run out of battery nine miles you
