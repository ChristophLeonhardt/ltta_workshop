SO, ARE THEY OUTRAGED BY IT?

57
00:02:05,703 --> 00:02:08,773
IT MIGHT SEEM COMPLETELY

58
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:09,306
REASONABLE TO THEM.

59
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:12,510
BOB ACCUSES VILLAGER OF

60
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,512

61
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:15,446

WATCH AND EXPLAIN IT.

TO THE SUPREME COURT AND I THINK

74
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:41,840
BEARS THE BURDEN OF DISPROVING

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,275
THESE ALLEGATIONS RATHER THAN

76
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:46,678

YOU THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY DEAD

79
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:51,616
CERTAIN THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH IS

80
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:52,717
GUILTY, BECAUSE YOU SAW IT ON

81
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:54,853
CNN, WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THIS

82
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:58,990
DOES PUT HIM IN A TOUGH SPOT.

83
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,427
BRETT KAVANAUGH NO LONGER HAS

84
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:05,030
THAT PROTECTION SO IT'S UP TO

85
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,033
HIM TO CLEAR HIS OWN NAME.

86
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:10,102
HE HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW HE CAN

87
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:12,905
PROVE THAT CHRISTINE FORD'S

88
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:13,639
FOGGY 36-YEAR-OLD MEMORIES ARE

89
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,707

GROW UP LEARNING ABOUT HOW THEIR

91
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:18,277
DATA AS A SEX OFFENDER, THAT'S

92
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:24,683
HIS CHOICE.

93
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:29,488
AND, DEMOCRATS ARE DEMANDING

94
00:03:29,488 --> 00:03:36,862
THAT KAVANAUGH CALLED DOWN YET

95
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:38,430
ANOTHER BUT DEMOCRATS WANT

96
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:38,764
ANOTHER.

97
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:40,866
THE ONLY WAY HE CAN SHOW HE'S

98
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:44,436
INNOCENT OF THESE CHARGES,

99
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:45,337
VARIOUS AND DUMB PEOPLE ON

101
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:48,507
NOD THEIR HEADS IN UNISON.

102
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:50,108
BUT WHAT THAT REALLY WORK?

103
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:52,110
IS THAT THE PURPOSE OF FBI

104
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,312
INVESTIGATIONS?

105
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:54,613
JOE BIDEN DOESN'T THINK SO.

106
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:57,716
KEEP IN MIND THAT BIDEN IS BOTH

107
00:03:57,716 --> 00:03:59,418
AN ATTORNEY AND FORMER CHAIRMAN

108
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:00,018
OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY

109
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:00,385
COMMITTEE.

110
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:01,420
WATCH THIS.

111
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,289
>> THE NEXT PERSON THAT REFERS

112
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:06,892
TO AN FBI REPORT AS BEING WORTH

113
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:08,760
ANYTHING DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

114
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,596
ANYTHING OBVIOUSLY.

115
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:14,666
FBI EXPLICITLY DOES NOT, IN THIS

116
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,668
OR ANY OTHER CASE, REACH A

117
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:25,677
CONCLUSION.

118
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:28,080
PERIOD.

119
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,248
>> Tucker: OKAY WE FOOLED YOU

120
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:31,984
AGAIN, THAT'S JOE BIDEN FROM THE

121
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:33,218
1991 JOEL CLARENCE HEARINGS.

122
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:35,254
HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

123
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:36,722
DEBATE THEN SO HE OBVIOUSLY HAD

124
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:37,990
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VIEWS THAN

125
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,093
THE ONES HE HOLDS TODAY.

126
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:43,695
DEMOCRATS KNOW THAT OF COURSE

127
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:45,230
BUT, SO WHAT, PROVING OR

128
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,133
DISPROVING A RECOVERED MEMORY IS

129
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:48,667
NOT THE POINT.

130
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,869
THE POINT IS DESTROYING BRETT

131
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:53,472
KAVANAUGH.

132
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:57,476
MOST DEMOCRATS DON'T HATE HIM

133
00:04:57,476 --> 00:05:00,312
PERSONALLY, THERE'S NOTHING

134
00:05:00,312 --> 00:05:02,515
PERSONAL ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

135
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:03,215
KAVANAUGH STANDS BEHIND THE

136
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,084
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE POWER

137
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:05,451
IT SEEKS.

138
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:07,953
HE'S IN THE WAY AND HE MUST BE

139
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:10,289
CRUSHED IN THE CASE OF HIS WIFE

140
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:10,923
INTO LITTLE GIRLS.

141
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:13,492
SORRY, THAT'S A COST OF WINNING.

142
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:16,128
NO OMELETTES WITHOUT SOME BROKEN

143
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:16,495
EGGS.

144
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:17,930
THE PROBLEM IS THAT OUTSIDE

145
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,899
PARTIES IN D.C., PEOPLE OUT

146
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:25,271
THERE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

147
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,705
WHY WOULDN'T THEY BELIEVE IT?

148
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:27,773
THAT'S THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT

149
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:33,078
NEVER CHANGES EVER, HUMAN

150
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:33,412
NATURE.

151
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,514
THERE IS A MOB INSTINCT IN

152
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:38,184
PEOPLE.

153
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:43,689
THE EVERY POPULATION, WISE

154
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:46,792
LEADERS KNOW THAT, WHY IS

155
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:58,070
LEADERS FEEL THAT.

156
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,838
YOU CAN TELL THE MOB IS BUILDING

157
00:05:58,838 --> 00:05:59,505
BY THE WAY PEOPLE TO START

158
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:00,906
TALKING, LIKE THIS.

159
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:01,874
I THINK THERE'S A COMPROMISE

160
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:04,310
HERE COME AND HEAR ME OUT ON

161
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,111
THIS.

162
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:06,512
SO KAVANAUGH GETS CONFIRMED TO

163
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:07,213
THE SUPREME COURT.

164
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:10,816
OKAY, IN RETURN WE GET TO CUT

165
00:06:10,816 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT PESKY OF HIS OFF IN FRONT
