Oh seems that things are looking grim er by the day when it comes to Justin Trudeau's favorite jihadi oops I'm sorry I mean favourite kidnap victim because it appears as though Joshua Boyle is an even bigger dirtbag than we originally thought well that was quite the bombshell penned by post media reporter Andrew Duffy regarding Joshua Boyle earlier this week you probably recall the bizarre story of Joshua Boyle back in October this Canadian and his American wife Caitlyn Coleman were rescued I think they were rescued you see the couple went on a backpacking excursion some five years ago to that romantic panacea known as Afghanistan hey who wouldn't want a vacation in one of the most upside-down screwed up regimes in the world alas the Taliban allegedly kidnapped the couple and then allegedly held them captive for five years I say allegedly because quite frankly I think Joshua Boyle suffers from severe credibility issues indeed from the get-go almost nothing added up when it came to the boil saga such as how would kidnap victims be allowed to have conjugal visits and give birth to three children while in captivity oh and let's not forget that Boyles ex-wife is none other than Xan Abe Cotter yes that Zen Abe the sister of former terrorists and current multi-millionaire Omar Khadr the always niqab clad sis she's the one who thought that the terrorist attacks on 9/11 were completely justified spidey senses tingling yet indeed the first gulp inducing moment even for those giving Boyle the benefit of the doubt surely occurred in January when Boyle was arrested and charged with 15 criminal acts we're talking serious stuff years such as eight counts of assault two counts of sexual assault two counts of unlawful can fly one count of uttering threats one count of public mischief and one count of administering and nauseous thing boys will be boys I guess eh okay enough backstory because earlier this week Postmedia dropped the aforementioned bombshell namely printing excerpts of unsealed court documents and what emerges according to the testimony of Caitlin Coleman is that Joshua Boyle is a misogynist a bully and someone who subscribes to quote extremist ideologies and the complete subservience of women end quote in other words he is an aspiring Islamist Coleman goes on to note that he was abusive to her while in captivity sometimes even physically assaulting her during fits of rage punched her so hard one said he broke her cheekbone he even threatened to kill her by setting her on fire I guess old Josh took some inspiration from Isis on that one and Coleman says that Boyle would also confine her to a small shower stall sometimes for weeks on end what a charmer Coleman is now back in her home state of Pennsylvania with her children after being granted temporary sole custody and if her allegations are indeed true it's also incredibly disturbing yet what's even more disturbing is the exclamation point on this story namely that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went out of his way late last year to arrange a private meeting with the Boyle clan but why what the hell was Justin thinking making time for this creep naturally Justin apologists will quickly point out that the criminal charges and Caitlyn's now public testimony well that all came after the invite was issued yeah nice try because as I stated earlier even before the meeting took place there were about oh I don't know a hundred and one red flags regarding this cat but our p.m. oh he just couldn't wait to meet with this cretin presumably because nothing says diversity more so than a Canadian and an American going to an Islamic regime and converting to Islam in the I mean that's diversity to the power of 10 in Justin's book that private meeting looked bad then and it looks absolutely horrid now yet how odd that our Prime Minister takes such exception to those who refer to him as jihadi Justin but when a PM gives War veterans the bird yet clears his calendar so that it can have tea with an Islamist well Justin maybe that's why you've ended up with such an unfortunate nickname for the rebel media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks a Breville has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
