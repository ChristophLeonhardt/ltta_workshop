1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,790
AFTER DECADES OF ACTIVISM IN
SAUDI ARABIA AROUND THE RIGHT TO

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,090
DRIVE, STARTING IN JUNE OF THIS
YEAR WOMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA WILL

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,590
BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE DRIVING
LICENSES FOR THE FIRST TIME.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,590
IN

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,490
ADVANCE OF THAT DATE, WHICH HAS
BEEN A LONG TIME COMING, MANY OF

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,150
THE VERY WOMEN WHO WERE ABLE TO
PUSH FOR THIS CHANGE HAVE BEEN

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,089
ROUNDED UP AND ARRESTED BY SAUDI
AUTHORITIES --

8
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:44,630
I WANT TO 
SPOTLIGHT A FEW OF

9
00:00:44,630 --> 00:01:17,219
THE ACTIVISTS --

10
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,600
I ALSO WANT TO READ A COMMENT
FROM ANOTHER REGISTERED DRIVE

11
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,600
ACTIVIST WHO WROTE A BOOK ABOUT
THIS CAMPAIGN, I WAS LUCKY

12
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,069
ENOUGH TO INTERVIEW HER IN OSLO
LAST YEAR AT THE FREEDOM FORUM

13
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:30,509
--

14
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:41,909
BY 

15
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,469
THE WAY, IN ADDITION TO
THE ARRESTS THAT HAVE

16
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:51,139
HAPPENED THERE HAVE ALSO
BEEN, AS WAS ALLUDED TO, A

17
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:53,579
CAMPAIGN AGAINST THESE ACTIVISTS
IN THE PRESS --

18
00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:06,959
THEY 

19
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,149
HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO AS
BELONGING TO A CELL THAT IS

20
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:15,370
COMING IN TO ATTEMPT TO
DESTABILIZE THE GOVERNMENT.

21
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,140
SAUDI WOMEN CIVIL RIGHTS
ACTIVIST JOINS THE CONVERSATION

22
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,030
OF BRAVEST PEOPLE ON EARTH ALONG
WITH RUSSIAN JOURNALIST,

23
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,870
PALESTINIAN CIVIL RIGHTS
ACTIVISTS, ETC.

24
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,709
THE CROWN PRINCE

25
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:36,270
IN SAUDI ARABIA IS AN
INTERESTING CHARACTER TO SAY THE

26
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,270
LEAST.

27
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,659
TWO SIDES TO HIM,
THEORETICALLY, ONE SIDE IS LET'S

28
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:45,049
GO COMMIT THE WORST HUMAN RIGHTS
ATROCITIES THE WORLD HAS SEEN IN

29
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:47,150
SOME TIME IN YEMEN.

30
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,040
AND LET'S
TRY TO DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE

31
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,030
MIDDLE EAST AND START A WAR WITH
IRAN.

32
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,000
AND LET'S KIDNAP FOREIGN

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,980
LEADERS, AS HE DID TO THE LEADER
OF LEBANON, AND MAKE THEM RESIGN

34
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,569
WHILE WE BASICALLY PUT A GUN TO
HIS HEAD.

35
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:02,510
LET ME ALSO GO CAPTURE

36
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,530
ALL THE OTHER PRINCES AND
IMPRISONED THEM IN A FANCY HOTEL

37
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,069
UNTIL THEY GIVE ME ALL THEIR
MONEY AND THEY WILL PRETEND IT'S

38
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,090
ABOUT CORRUPTION WHILE I BUY A
$500 MILLION YACHT.

39
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,090
THAT IS

40
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,269
LITERALLY WHAT HAPPENED.

41
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,030
ON THE
OTHER HAND, WAS SUPPOSED TO BE,

42
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,099
BUT I'M GOING TO LET WOMEN
DRIVE.

43
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,680
AND I'M DOING REFORMS,

44
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,819
THE WAHHABIS AREN'T IN CHARGE
ANYMORE, THE STRICT

45
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,890
FUNDAMENTALIST MUSLIMS OF SAUDI
ARABIA, HE WENT ON A TOUR IN

46
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,799
AMERICA AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF
PROPAGANDA AND 60 MINUTES HELPED

47
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,799
HIM OUT AND GAVE HIS SIDE OF THE
STORY LARGELY I THINK, AND SOME

48
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,519
ARTICLES POINT OUT SOME OF THE
OTHER STUFF, BUT A LOT OF

49
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,810
GLOWING PRAISE ABOUT HIM BEING A
REFORMER BECAUSE NOW HE'S ALLIED

50
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,829
WITH ISRAEL, IF YOU ALLY WITH
ISRAEL YOU HAVE A LOT OF GREAT

51
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:52,269
PRESS IN AMERICA, BUT IT TURNS
OUT THE REFORMS, EH, THEY DIDN'T

52
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,760
MENTION THE PART WHERE THEY
ARREST ALL THE WOMEN WERE

53
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,749
FIGHTING FOR THESE REFORMS THE
FIRST PLACE.

54
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:59,290
SO WHATEVER YOU SAW

55
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,500
THAT WAS POSITIVE ABOUT THE
CROWN PRINCE, WHATEVER LITTLE

56
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,250
THERE WAS, NOW ADD A GIANT GRAIN
OF SALT.

57
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,050
I WAS POST TO BE EXCITED THAT
IN 2018 WOMEN FOR THE FIRST TIME

58
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,719
ARE ABLE TO DRIVE?

59
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,280
THIS IS ONE
OF THE WORST COUNTRIES IN THE

60
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,840
WORLD FOR WOMEN IN THIS CHARM
OFFENSIVE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

61
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,889
WAS INSULTING, HERE YOU HAVE THE
PRINCE BEING LAUDED AROUND THE

62
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:23,710
MAINSTREAM MEDIA, EVEN IN THE
GUARDIAN THEY SAID HE WAS THIS

63
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,580
REFORMER, A REVOLUTIONARY, ONE
OF THE WORST PLACES IN THE WORLD

64
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,100
FOR WOMEN, A POLICE STATE
DICTATORSHIP, NOT EVEN JUST

65
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,509
WOMEN, THERE ARE PEOPLE BEHEADED
FOR SORCERY, POLITICAL

66
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:38,389
DISSIDENTS EXECUTED EN MASSE FOR
PROTESTING, THERE WAS NO ARAB

67
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:43,680
SPRING THERE, EVERYONE WAS
KILLED.

68
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
THIS IS THE U.S.

69
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,910
EMPIRE'S GAS STATION AND
BATTERING RAM IN THE MIDDLE

70
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,750
EAST, LIKE ISRAEL WE USE IT AS A
ONE-STOP SHOP FOR ALL THIS STUFF

71
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,259
AND WE COVER UP THESE EGREGIOUS
WAR CRIMES.

72
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,259
LIKE YOU SAID THE

73
00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:00,270
GREATEST HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN
THE WORLD IS IN YEMEN.

74
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,470
SO I AM

75
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,810
VEHEMENTLY DISGUSTED WITH THE
COVERAGE OF SAUDI ARABIA, AND

76
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,250
THEN THIS, EVEN ON TOP OF WOMEN
HAVING THE RIGHT TO DRIVE, THEY

77
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,250
ARE RESTING ALL THE PEOPLE.

78
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,870
WILL
THEY DO RETRACTIONS IN ALL THESE

79
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,530
PAPERS THAT LAUDED HIM AS A
REVOLUTIONARY?

80
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,090
ARE THEY GOING TO DO AN EQUAL
AND OPPOSITE PIECE ON 60

81
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,090
MINUTES?

82
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,000
THAT WILL LAST 15 OR 20
MINUTES, ABOUT HOW IT TURNS OUT,

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,240
NO, HE'S JUST AS BARBARIC AS OF
ONE ELSE, PLUS ALL THE OTHER

84
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
THINGS?

85
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
NO.

86
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,710
BUT LOOK, WE KNOW
THE PREPOSTEROUS DOUBLE STANDARD

87
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,539
OF THE U.S. PRESS.

88
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:38,979
WHEN IRAN
STRUCK BACK AT ISRAEL AFTER

89
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:42,410
ISRAEL HAD REPEATEDLY BOMBED
THEIR POSITIONS INSIDE SYRIA,

90
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:48,290
MOST OF THE PRESS REPORTED IT AS
ISRAEL HAS TO RESPOND TO IRAN'S

91
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,860
ATTACKS.

92
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,740
CONVENIENTLY LIVING OUT
ISRAEL'S EARLIER ATTACKS.

93
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,740
EVEN

94
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,889
THE NEW YORK TIMES, THEY WOULD
WRITE IT, BUT ON PARAGRAPH 48,

95
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,849
BY THE WAY ISRAEL ATTACKED
EARLIER.

96
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:02,690
LOOK, THERE IS AN

97
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,319
ISRAEL, SAUDI ARABIA, UNITED
ARAB EMIRATES ALLIANCE.

98
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,319
ANYONE

99
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,150
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THAT
ALLIANCE -- QATAR, IRAN, YEMEN

100
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,419
-- IS IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE.

101
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:15,570
AND
ANYONE ON THE QUOTE UNQUOTE

102
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,000
RIGHT SIDE, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THEY DO.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,009
THESE WOMEN WHO

104
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:25,160
HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR HUMAN
RIGHTS IN SAUDI ARABIA UNDER A

105
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,240
REIGN OF TERROR WHERE THEY
IMPRISON THEM AND CALL THEM

106
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,270
TRADERS, WHAT DO WE DO?

107
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,270
NOTHING.

108
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,050
I GUARANTEE YOU THEY WON'T BE A

109
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,080
SANCTION, SINGLE ACTION, BECAUSE
IF THIS ALLIANCE IS IN FAVOR OF

110
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,960
IT, WE BOW OUR HEADS.

111
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,639
I DISAGREE THAT THERE WON'T BE
A SINGLE ACTION, EVENTUALLY THEY

112
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,379
WILL RUN OUT OF THE WEAPONS WE
JUST SOLD THEM AND THEY WILL

113
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:47,379
NEED MORE.

114
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:50,580
WE HAVE TO SELL THEM
TO THEM EVENTUALLY, CENK, GET

115
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,580
REAL.

116
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,590
AND OBVIOUSLY GREAT
CONTEXT AROUND THIS.

117
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,590
FOR THIS

118
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,220
ISSUE, THEY ARE ROUNDING UP ALL
THESE PEOPLE, I DON'T THINK

119
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,550
ANYONE SHOULD TAKE IT FOR
GRANTED THAT ON THE 24TH THESE

120
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,680
LICENSES WILL BE GIVEN OUT.

121
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,430
IF
YOU READ ABOUT THE HISTORY OF

122
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,729
THIS CAMPAIGN IT GOES BACK
MULTIPLE DECADES OF WOMEN GOING

123
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:14,261
OUT, ORIGINALLY JUST ONE OR TWO
PEOPLE WOULD DO THIS, GET

124
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:18,690
ARRESTED AND LOCKED UP, IT HAS
HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES, LIKE I

125
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,319
SAID, I THINK THE BOOK IS DARING
TO DRIVE, SHE ALLOWED HERSELF TO

126
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,530
BE FILMED DRIVING AND SPREAD IT
AROUND, THANKFULLY THAT GOT SOME

127
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,711
INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION, BUT
AS YOU POINTED OUT, I HAVE

128
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:34,889
STARTED WATCHING THE HANDMADE'S
TALE -- THEY HAVE IT WAY BETTER

129
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,660
THAN WOMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA HAVE
IT NOW.

130
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,879
SO TO WATCH EVEN THE

131
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,860
SMALL GAINS THAT THE ACTIVISTS
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SQUEEZE OUT OF

132
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,520
THIS REGIME POSSIBLY BEING TAKEN
BACK IS HEARTBREAKING.

133
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,949
THAT IS WHY I THINK -- I DON'T
HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL SO WHO KNOWS

134
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:54,189
-- THAT'S WHAT I THINK THEY MAKE
IT TO DRIVE ON THE 24TH BECAUSE

135
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:56,720
THIS AT LEAST SENDS THE MESSAGE
TO THE ACTIVISTS, IF YOU ARE

136
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,490
THINKING LIKE A DICTATOR, YOU
ARE GETTING WHAT YOU WANT, YOU

137
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,210
ARE GETTING A WIN, BUT YOU'RE
NOT.

138
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,580
SO EVERYONE ELSE LOOK AT

139
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,050
THIS SAYING I MIGHT WIN HERE BUT
I WILL PERSONALLY PAY FOR

140
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,750
IT AS I DO.

141
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,550
THEY DO SEE THE REST OF THE
WORLD BEING MAD ABOUT THIS.

142
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,539
IT SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE
SAYING DON'T EVER DO WHAT

143
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,139
THESE WOMEN DID.

144
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,259
GREAT POINT, JEN.

145
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:22,970
TWO PARTS TO
IT, ONE IS WE ARE GIVING YOU A

146
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,750
CONCESSION BUT DON'T TRY IT
AGAIN BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU GET

147
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,439
THE CONCESSION YOU PERSONALLY
WILL PAY A HUGE PRICE, DON'T

148
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,890
EVER FORGET.

149
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,328
DON'T DEFY US.

150
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:34,328
THE
IDEA THAT THE GUY IS A

151
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:37,468
REVOLUTIONARY IS HILARIOUS, HE'S
LITERALLY A DICTATOR.

152
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:38,469
YOU NEED

153
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,429
THE REVOLUTION AGAINST HIM.

154
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,658
DICTATORS DON'T NEED

155
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,659
REVOLUTIONS.

156
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,700
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
IF HE GETS RID OF THE WAHHABIS

157
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,970
AND BRINGS SAUDI ARABIA CLOSER
TO SECULARISM I WOULD LOVE THAT.

158
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,450
BUT I WILL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE
IT, AND IT DOESN'T VITIATE ALL

159
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,310
OF THE OTHER TERRIBLE THINGS
HE'S DOING.

160
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,560
BUT THE SECOND PART

161
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08,610
OF JEN'S POINT IS THE WAHHABIS,
THE FUNDAMENTALISTS, ARE STRONG,

162
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:18,769
SO THEY MIGHT BE SAYING WE KNOW
HOW MUCH YOU DESPISE THESE

163
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:21,430
REVOLUTIONARIES SO WE WILL WALK
THEM UP ANYWAY.

164
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,640
THAT'S A WAY TO

165
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,730
SMOOTH THE WAY TOWARDS A TINY
AMOUNT OF REFORM.

166
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,730
THEY

167
00:09:28,730 --> 00:00:00,000
WILL STILL HAVE TO ASK THEIR
HUSBANDS IF THEY CAN DRIVE.
