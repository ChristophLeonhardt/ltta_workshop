5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,300
you're right did start as a measurement

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,250
company and measurement<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really the</font>

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,260
foundation to get to where we ultimately

8
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,149
have the vision to take the company

9
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is to really connect buyers and</font>

10
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,520
sellers of media in a way that is

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,680
defined around audiences and people

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">really ask a lot of times what does that</font>

13
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,220
really mean well what it means is if you

14
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,230
think about search search is all about

15
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,150
audiences<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's people typing in keywords</font>

16
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,039
and people building out audiences based

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,780
on the keywords<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those consumers are</font>

18
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,300
are essentially typing into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box in</font>

19
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,339
display you don't have that and so what

20
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,929
we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we've developed a way for</font>

21
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,309
advertisers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> define their own</font>

22
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,260
audiences by placing a pixel on their

23
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,629
website capturing what's unique about

24
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,389
that person and then finding more people

25
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:51,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">like them across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the web and the media</font>

26
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:53,559
program essentially joins the two sides

27
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:55,569
the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> and advertiser builds an</font>

28
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:57,429
audience segments and a publisher can

29
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:59,199
then sell that exact audience segments

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,940
to them what it does is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it reduces</font>

31
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,010
friction it gives the<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertisers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

32
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,509
ability to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have confidence in the</font>

33
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:06,219
audience that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're buying it gives</font>

34
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:08,049
the publisher<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to speak in</font>

35
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:10,240
the advertisers language so that they

36
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,039
can specifically deliver the audience's

37
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they're looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for and this is a</font>

38
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,000
real departure from traditional media

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,310
buying which has been typically based on

40
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,649
essentially indexes I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy this</font>

41
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:22,810
property<font color="#CCCCCC"> because this property index is</font>

42
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,609
high from my audience what we're doing

43
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:25,840
this we're flipping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> model on that's</font>

44
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,369
head and being able to enable the

45
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:29,740
advertiser to say these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the this is</font>

46
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the audience I want to go for it here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

47
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,200
here are the people the users<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,909
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach and here's across the</font>

49
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:39,490
entire web where those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist and</font>

50
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,439
that was really if you think about

51
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,179
what's really revolutionary about

52
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:45,369
quantcast is because we see both sides

53
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:47,200
of that marketplace<font color="#E5E5E5"> we give the</font>

54
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,759
advertiser<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability to find the</font>

55
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,200
audience and then because we have that

56
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,179
measurement service in place we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell</font>

57
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,369
the advertiser exactly where those those

58
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,920
people are so that they know who to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

59
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,899
talk to now to buy their audiences and

60
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:00,759
they do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> at an impression by an</font>

61
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,619
impression level versus just<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brown</font>

62
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:05,380
broadly on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sites in its totality now</font>

63
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,090
is this what differentiates you from

64
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,639
your competition yeah I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say</font>

65
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,280
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really what puts quantcast very</font>

66
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,890
unique

67
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,569
in the marketplace there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

68
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,660
do various different kind of portions of

69
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,580
the quantcast offering so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

70
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,530
there are measurement companies out

71
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,550
there that provide measurement data

72
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,400
about properties problem with those is

73
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,530
that they have a very what I would say

74
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,660
antiquated way in which they provide

75
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,459
measurement they provide measurement

component of the total audience out on

81
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,410
the web our model goes a little bit

82
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,940
deeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and gives you census</font>

84
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,239
doing you have data companies that

85
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,360
provide data but those companies when

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,150
you provide just single source data you

87
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,830
typically have very small audiences

88
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,440
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is not available you know</font>

89

they have confidence if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,299
what's happened in television marketers

99
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:21,860
have confidence in buying audiences

100
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,420
across television because there is a

101
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,400
currency for audiences they rely on

102
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,530

<font color="#E5E5E5">different it's an individual impression</font>

my impression addressability and that

105
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:34,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">really distances us from our competition</font>

106
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,799
because we excuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> me we do have this</font>

massive footprint over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 million</font>

108

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives us comprehensive visibility</font>

110
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:45,650
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet we have machine learning</font>

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,239
that creates those<font color="#E5E5E5"> predictions about</font>

112
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:49,730
about the consumers and then give the

113

advertisers and publishers access to

114
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,390
that on an anonymous basis so that they

115
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,769
can then<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage that information to</font>

116
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,450
better target the advertising so you

little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more valid than new</font>

123
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,510
methodology there was a problem that

124
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">needed to be solved and the problem was</font>

125
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,390
mass the mass amount of the

126
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,488
internet was becoming highly fragmented

127
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:20,670
and what needed to happen was a solution

128
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,290
needed to come in that could measure the

129
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,360
preponderance of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet panel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> base</font>

130
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,040
were really<font color="#E5E5E5"> only able to handle the</font>

131
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,320
largest companies and then at that level

132
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,120
could not go very<font color="#E5E5E5"> granular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee within</font>

133
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,470
those they could measure at a total site

134
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,480
level so when we extended down and now

135
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,790
can measure individual web assets as

136
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,210
small as<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500 consumers you now opened up</font>

an understanding the internet that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

138
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,480
never had before so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start</font>

139
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,370
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then what happened after that</font>

140
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,890
was really very simply we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,990
extend into marketers marketers could

those nuances about customers you know

169
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,750
can you understand what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

170
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,520
about the people consuming a particular

171
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,010
diaper product then the people consuming

172
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,680
a particular liquid detergent all of a

173

better you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that they have</font>

179
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,240
in-house yes yeah great<font color="#CCCCCC"> question so one</font>

180
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,950
unique piece about quantcast is we

181
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,870
always start with the marketers data so

182
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,850
we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with an event right and</font>

183
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,260
the marketer thinks of events in

184
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,000
different ways someone might<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of it</font>

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
as a click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ad but the majority of</font>

186
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,200
people think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

187
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,450
tional level right who downloaded a

188
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,670
brochure who configured a car who

189
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,130
downloaded a coupon and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

190
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,020
some marketers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work with us and</font>

191
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,420
actually pass us data so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> passes</font>

192
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,070
data anonymously out of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> CRM</font>

193
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,900
database and now they can get really

194
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,600
interesting metrics like what was the

195
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,540
shopping cart like for this particular

196
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">consumer right show me what's they have</font>

197
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,290
audience profile someone who purchases

198
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,940
five hundred dollars versus someone who

199
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,980
purchases a hundred dollars because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

200
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,900
people are looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we all know</font>

201
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,370
there's a there's a very sharp

202
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,440
distribution curve when you look at

203
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,390
consumption patterns there's a small

204
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,590
amount of people that are highly

205
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,030
profitable for companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they want</font>

206
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find and replicate and find more</font>

207
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,270
people right that are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that highly</font>

208
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,190
profitable customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment so we do</font>

209
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,600
allow marketers to bring in their own

210
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,460
data leverage that then against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

211
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,280
entire data set that we have you know

212
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,500
that that data set then enables them to

213
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">really create massive extension of</font>

214
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,310
audiences but only the audience's that

215
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,020
matter only those audiences that are the

216
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">most profitable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that should having</font>

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,670
to pay to count your traffic property be

218
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,450
illegal illegal that's a strong term I

219
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,880
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that quantcast we view that</font>

220
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,650
markets<font color="#E5E5E5"> are efficient right we've</font>

221
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,030
announced a solution into the

222
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,680
marketplace that does provide free data

223
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,750
for everyone right you can come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and a</font>

224
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,510
self-service basis and use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

225
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,910
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that over time right data is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

226
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,350
to become something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is ubiquitous</font>

227
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,150
we believe that's important to have out

228
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the marketplace so that people can</font>

229
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,240
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> better decisions we then take the</font>

230
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,980
approach that we will then charge for

231
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,780
the use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data right when you</font>

232
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,400
actually want to action you can take an

233
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,690
action with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a think of it very similar</font>

234
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,670
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a stock market data is free in the</font>

235
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,020
stock market you can go find a stock

236
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,880
quote pretty much from any website but

237
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,350
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to take action to actually</font>

238
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,610
purchase a stalker you want to take

239
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,230
action to engage in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

240
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,270
transaction you pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right to do</font>

241
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,490
that and so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similarly</font>

242
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,020
in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our business right we</font>

243
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,550
provide data out to the market<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

244
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that makes a more intelligent market</font>

245
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,120
creates a more efficient market and then

246
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,250
we charge<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the transaction level</font>

247
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,040
activity that happens and you know will

248
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,660
our competitors follow suit I don't know

249
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,100
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be difficult than</font>

250
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,320
active<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I think it's one of those</font>

251
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,539
things that the market will tell us you

252
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,208
know whether our<font color="#CCCCCC"> model</font>

253
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,938
one that that ultimately prevails but I

254
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:38,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great thing about</font>

255
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:40,149
competition is that everyone can put out

256
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:41,799
there they're offering in the market

257
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,389
will judge what's the better software

258
00:08:43,389 --> 00:00:00,000
for them
