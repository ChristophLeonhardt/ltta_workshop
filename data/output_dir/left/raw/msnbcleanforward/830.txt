1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,369
THE WASHINGTON FREE BEACON. MIMI, LET ME START WITH YOU.

2
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:04,905
MIMI, LET ME START WITH YOU. I HAVE TO SAY I HAVE GONE BACK

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,072
I HAVE TO SAY I HAVE GONE BACK AND FORTH.

4
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:08,708
AND FORTH. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS

5
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:09,976
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS COOPERATION AGREEMENT?

6
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,312
COOPERATION AGREEMENT? HOW SWEETHEART OF A DEAL DID

7
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,246
HOW SWEETHEART OF A DEAL DID PAUL MANAFORT GET IN YOUR

8
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:13,580
PAUL MANAFORT GET IN YOUR OPINION?

9
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:15,048
OPINION? >> WELL, AS TO THE FIRST

10
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:15,882
>> WELL, AS TO THE FIRST QUESTION, CHUCK, I THINK IT’S

11
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:16,449
QUESTION, CHUCK, I THINK IT’S VERY SIGNIFICANT.

12
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,551
VERY SIGNIFICANT. I KNOW WE USE A LOT OF

13
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:20,053
I KNOW WE USE A LOT OF HYPERBOLE, AND ESPECIALLY THESE

14
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:21,288
HYPERBOLE, AND ESPECIALLY THESE DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF

15
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:22,088
DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF BIG EVENTS.

16
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,323
BIG EVENTS. BUT I REALLY DON’T -- I THINK

17
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,891
BUT I REALLY DON’T -- I THINK IT’S HARD TO OVERSTATE THE

18
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:25,692
IT’S HARD TO OVERSTATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS.

19
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,961
SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS. THIS IS, AS YOU SAID, PAUL

20
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:32,365
THIS IS, AS YOU SAID, PAUL MANAFORT WAS ON THE INSIDE, IN

21
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:32,899
MANAFORT WAS ON THE INSIDE, IN THE CAMPAIGN.

22
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,502
THE CAMPAIGN. ALSO, YOU KNOW, INTIMATELY TIED

23
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:40,207
ALSO, YOU KNOW, INTIMATELY TIED TO RUSSIA, TO CAN STAN TEEN

24
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,375
TO RUSSIA, TO CAN STAN TEEN KILIMNIK AND OTHERS.

25
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:43,010
KILIMNIK AND OTHERS. IF THERE’S ANY ONE PERSON WHO

26
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:43,978
IF THERE’S ANY ONE PERSON WHO CAN OFFER INFORMATION TO THE

27
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:45,779
CAN OFFER INFORMATION TO THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ON WHETHER, IN

28
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,014
SPECIAL COUNSEL ON WHETHER, IN FACT, THERE WAS CONSPIRACY

29
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,149
FACT, THERE WAS CONSPIRACY BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE CAMPAIGN

30
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,717
BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE CAMPAIGN AND THE RUSSIANS, WHO ARE

31
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:51,718
AND THE RUSSIANS, WHO ARE ALREADY CHARGED WITH THAT

32
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,386
ALREADY CHARGED WITH THAT CONSPIRACY TO INTERFERE IN THE

33
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:55,022
CONSPIRACY TO INTERFERE IN THE ELECTION, THEN I THINK MANAFORT

34
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:55,789
ELECTION, THEN I THINK MANAFORT IS THAT PERSON.

35
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,724
IS THAT PERSON. I AM NOT SAYING THAT MUELLER

36
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,092
I AM NOT SAYING THAT MUELLER COULDN’T HAVE FINISHED HIS

37
00:00:59,093 --> 00:00:59,726
COULDN’T HAVE FINISHED HIS INVESTIGATION WITHOUT HIM.

38
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,961
INVESTIGATION WITHOUT HIM. I THINK HE COULD HAVE.

39
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:03,830
I THINK HE COULD HAVE. BUT I THINK THAT MANAFORT CAN

40
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:06,934
BUT I THINK THAT MANAFORT CAN PROVIDE REALLY KEY FACTS AND

41
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:07,534
PROVIDE REALLY KEY FACTS AND INSIDE INFORMATION.

42
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:09,770
INSIDE INFORMATION. IN TERMS OF THE SWEETHEART DEAL,

43
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:12,105
IN TERMS OF THE SWEETHEART DEAL, I DON’T THINK HE REALLY GOT A

44
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:13,307
I DON’T THINK HE REALLY GOT A HUGE SWEETHEART DEAL.

45
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:14,641
HUGE SWEETHEART DEAL. I MEAN HE’S DEFINITELY GETTING A

46
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:14,941
I MEAN HE’S DEFINITELY GETTING A BREAK.

47
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:16,643
BREAK. THERE’S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

48
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:19,446
THERE’S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. HIS SENTENCE UNDER THE TERMS OF

49
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,248
HIS SENTENCE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PLEA AGREEMENT IS MAXED OUT

50
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:23,283
THE PLEA AGREEMENT IS MAXED OUT AT TEN YEARS.

51
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:24,952
AT TEN YEARS. SO NO MATTER WHAT THE GUIDELINES

52
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:28,189
SO NO MATTER WHAT THE GUIDELINES ARE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE PLEA

53
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:29,623
ARE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE PLEA AGREEMENT, IT TALKS ABOUT 262

54
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:29,957
AGREEMENT, IT TALKS ABOUT 262 MONTHS.

55
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:30,324
MONTHS. >> YEAH.

56
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:32,560
>> YEAH. >> HE IS FACING MORE, BUT THE

57
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:34,395
>> HE IS FACING MORE, BUT THE WAY THEY STRUCTURED THE PLEA IS

58
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:35,963
WAY THEY STRUCTURED THE PLEA IS SO THAT EACH COUNT ONLY IS

59
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:37,064
SO THAT EACH COUNT ONLY IS ALLOWED TO BE SENTENCED UP TO

60
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:37,798
ALLOWED TO BE SENTENCED UP TO FIVE YEARS.

61
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,166
FIVE YEARS. AND IF YOU PUT THOSE ON TOP OF

62
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:40,734
AND IF YOU PUT THOSE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER, THEY WOULD BE TEN

63
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:41,034
EACH OTHER, THEY WOULD BE TEN YEARS.

64
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:42,570
YEARS. BUT HE COULD, IN FACT, GET MUCH

65
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:43,070
BUT HE COULD, IN FACT, GET MUCH LESS THAN THAT.

66
00:01:43,072 --> 00:01:44,772
LESS THAN THAT. HE COULD HAVE CONCURRENT

67
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:45,873
HE COULD HAVE CONCURRENT FIVE-YEAR SENTENCES.

68
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:48,709
FIVE-YEAR SENTENCES. IT ALSO COULD TAKE -- BE

69
00:01:48,744 --> 00:01:49,844
IT ALSO COULD TAKE -- BE CONCURRENT, RUN AT THE SAME TIME

70
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:51,278
CONCURRENT, RUN AT THE SAME TIME THAT MEANS, AS THE SENTENCE IN

71
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,779
THAT MEANS, AS THE SENTENCE IN THE OTHER CASE.

72
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:54,782
THE OTHER CASE. SO HE COULD GET A HUGE BREAK ON

73
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:55,182
SO HE COULD GET A HUGE BREAK ON SENTENCING.

74
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:56,984
SENTENCING. BUT MY SENSE IS THEY WOULD ONLY

75
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:58,586
BUT MY SENSE IS THEY WOULD ONLY HAVE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT

76
00:01:58,587 --> 00:02:00,388
HAVE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT IF THEY REALLY THOUGHT HE HAD

77
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:01,188
IF THEY REALLY THOUGHT HE HAD VALUABLE INFORMATION.

78
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,390
VALUABLE INFORMATION. >> IF THE PRESIDENT PARDONED HIM

79
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,395
>> IF THE PRESIDENT PARDONED HIM TOMORROW, WHAT’S TO STOP PAUL

80
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:09,297
TOMORROW, WHAT’S TO STOP PAUL MANAFORT SIMPLY SAY, I TOLD YOU

81
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:11,332
MANAFORT SIMPLY SAY, I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I CAN TELL YOU.

82
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:12,600
EVERYTHING I CAN TELL YOU. I’VE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I CAN

83
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:12,967
I’VE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I CAN TELL YOU.

84
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:15,169
TELL YOU. AND HE JUST HAS THIS PARDON AS

85
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,070
AND HE JUST HAS THIS PARDON AS SORT OF A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE

86
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,705
SORT OF A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD AND A GET OUT OF TESTIFYING

87
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:18,406
CARD AND A GET OUT OF TESTIFYING TO MUELLER CARD.

88
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,574
TO MUELLER CARD. >> BECAUSE HE WOULDN’T GET OUT

89
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:20,308
>> BECAUSE HE WOULDN’T GET OUT OF JAIL FREE.

90
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:21,909
OF JAIL FREE. YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL -- AND

91
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:24,078
YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL -- AND THIS IS MORE ON THE POLITICAL

92
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:24,712
THIS IS MORE ON THE POLITICAL SIDE.

93
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:25,980
SIDE. BUT AT THIS POINT, NOW THAT

94
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:27,615
BUT AT THIS POINT, NOW THAT MANAFORT HAS BEEN SIGNED UP AS A

95
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:28,683
MANAFORT HAS BEEN SIGNED UP AS A COOPERATOR AND THE EXPECTATION

96
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:29,984
COOPERATOR AND THE EXPECTATION IS THAT HE’S PROVIDING

97
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:31,419
IS THAT HE’S PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENT

98
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,121
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OR CERTAINLY ABOUT OTHER MEMBERS

99
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:35,123
OR CERTAINLY ABOUT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CAMPAIGN, EVEN IF NOT THE

100
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:37,659
OF THE CAMPAIGN, EVEN IF NOT THE PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD

101
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:39,227
PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD REALLY BE OBSTRUCTIVE OF HIM AT

102
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:40,728
REALLY BE OBSTRUCTIVE OF HIM AT THIS POINT TO PARDON MANAFORT.

103
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,429
THIS POINT TO PARDON MANAFORT. SO THAT’S POINT ONE.

104
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:43,698
SO THAT’S POINT ONE. POINT TWO, THOUGH, IS EVEN IF

105
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:45,700
POINT TWO, THOUGH, IS EVEN IF TRUMP DID PARDON HIM, MANAFORT

106
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:50,438
TRUMP DID PARDON HIM, MANAFORT IS FACING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

107
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,639
IS FACING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE UNDER STATE LAW, AND

108
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:54,609
EXPOSURE UNDER STATE LAW, AND THIS PLEA, I THINK, IS

109
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:55,910
THIS PLEA, I THINK, IS STRUCTURED IN SUCH A WAY THAT

110
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:58,446
STRUCTURED IN SUCH A WAY THAT EVEN IF PARDONED FOR THESE

111
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,213
EVEN IF PARDONED FOR THESE CRIMES, I THINK THERE WOULD BE

112
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:00,849
CRIMES, I THINK THERE WOULD BE WAYS AROUND THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY

113
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,050
WAYS AROUND THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY ISSUES IN MANY DIFFERENT STATES

114
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:02,550
ISSUES IN MANY DIFFERENT STATES INCLUDING NEW YORK.

115
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:04,018
INCLUDING NEW YORK. SO I DON’T THINK THIS WOULD GET

116
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:05,653
SO I DON’T THINK THIS WOULD GET MANAFORT OUT FROM UNDER IT AND

117
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:06,254
MANAFORT OUT FROM UNDER IT AND OUT FROM JAIL.

118
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:08,256
OUT FROM JAIL. AND THE SPECIAL COUNSEL COULD

119
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:10,458
AND THE SPECIAL COUNSEL COULD THEN -- THERE’S OTHER CONDUCT,

120
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:12,126
THEN -- THERE’S OTHER CONDUCT, YOU KNOW, THAT THEY PROBABLY

121
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:13,061
YOU KNOW, THAT THEY PROBABLY COULD STILL CHARGE HIM WITH.

122
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:15,030
COULD STILL CHARGE HIM WITH. WE DON’T KNOW WHAT MANAFORT --

123
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:16,765
WE DON’T KNOW WHAT MANAFORT -- IF THERE WERE GOING TO BE OTHER

124
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:17,532
IF THERE WERE GOING TO BE OTHER CHARGES AGAINST MANAFORT.

125
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:19,067
CHARGES AGAINST MANAFORT. >> ONE WOULD ASSUME MUELLER HAD

126
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,869
>> ONE WOULD ASSUME MUELLER HAD THOUGHT OF ALL OF THOSE

127
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:23,872
THOUGHT OF ALL OF THOSE POTENTIAL ANGLES TO THIS BEFORE

128
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:24,673
POTENTIAL ANGLES TO THIS BEFORE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT?

129
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:25,307
ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT? >> YES.

130
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:27,375
>> YES. AND I THINK MUELLER HAS MADE

131
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:29,077
AND I THINK MUELLER HAS MADE THIS AS PARDON-PROOF AS

132
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:29,444
THIS AS PARDON-PROOF AS POSSIBLE.

133
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,546
POSSIBLE. HE IS CLEARLY THINKING ABOUT

134
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:31,846
HE IS CLEARLY THINKING ABOUT THIS.

135
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:32,481
THIS. >> OKAY.

136
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:34,650
>> OKAY. >> THE FORFEITURE THAT HAS BEEN

137
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:35,784
>> THE FORFEITURE THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM MANAFORT, THAT’S NOT

138
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:37,452
TAKEN FROM MANAFORT, THAT’S NOT GOING AWAY EVEN WITH THE PARDON.

139
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:39,087
GOING AWAY EVEN WITH THE PARDON. SO, YOU KNOW, HE’S NOT GETTING

140
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:41,256
SO, YOU KNOW, HE’S NOT GETTING HIS PROPERTIES BACK.

141
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:44,292
HIS PROPERTIES BACK. I THINK AT THIS POINT MANAFORT’S

142
00:03:44,327 --> 00:03:45,894
I THINK AT THIS POINT MANAFORT’S BEST CHANCE OF HIS FAMILY

143
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:47,095
BEST CHANCE OF HIS FAMILY STAYING SAFE, WHICH IS SOMETHING

144
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:48,263
STAYING SAFE, WHICH IS SOMETHING HIS LAWYER SPECIFICALLY

145
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:48,764
HIS LAWYER SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED --

146
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:50,565
MENTIONED -- >> FASCINATING, YES.

147
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,401
>> FASCINATING, YES. >> -- AND HIM STAYING OUT OF

148
00:03:52,435 --> 00:00:00,000
>> -- AND HIM STAYING OUT OF JAIL FOR, YOU KNOW -- OR BEING
