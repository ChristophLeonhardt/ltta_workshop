00:00:00,247 --> 00:00:03,350
I'M GREG GUTFELD, KENNEDY,

00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,818

00:00:04,818 --> 00:00:05,185
WILLIAMS.

4
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:08,154
THIS IS THE FIVE.

5
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:09,756
PRESIDENT TRUMP PUTTING

00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:10,991
AMERICA FIRST FRONT AND

7
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:13,160
CENTER DURING A ROUSING

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,928
COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AT THE

9
00:00:14,928 --> 00:00:15,729
U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY

10
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:16,129
GRADUATION.

11
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,631
THIS COMES AS MORE NEW

12
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:18,498
DEVELOPMENTS UNFOLD OVER THE

13
00:00:18,498 --> 00:00:19,499
NORTH KOREA SUMMIT.

14
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:20,867
BUT, BEFORE WE GET TO THAT

15
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:22,269
LET'S HEAR THE PRESIDENT'S

16
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:24,905
MESSAGE TO THE CLASS OF 2018

17
00:00:24,905 --> 00:00:26,139
STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF

18
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:28,041
OUR MILITARY'S MIGHT.

19
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,211
>> WE ARE WITNESSING THE

20
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:34,714
GREAT REAWAKENING OF THE

21
00:00:34,714 --> 00:00:36,449
AMERICAN SPIRIT AND OF

22
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:37,417
AMERICAN MIGHT.

23
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:40,854
WE HAVE REDISCOVERED OUR

24
00:00:40,854 --> 00:00:44,391
IDENTITY.

25
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:45,458
REGAINED OUR STRIDE.

26
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,061
AND WE ARE PROUD AGAIN.

27
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,664
YES, THEY ARE RESPECTING US

28
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:51,598
AGAIN.

29
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:53,466
YES, AMERICA IS BACK.

30
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:57,170
THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT WAR

31
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,372
IS TO BE FULLY PREPARED FOR

32
00:00:59,372 --> 00:01:01,141
WAR.

33
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:04,578
IF A FIGHT MUST COME, THERE

34
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:08,548
IS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE.

35
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:10,183
VICTORY, WINNING, BEAUTIFUL

36
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:10,851
WORDS.

37
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:15,121
TO THE CLASS OF 2018, I DO

38
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:18,892
SAY STRIFE FOR

39
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:20,160
SAY STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE.

40
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,830
LIVE FOR ADVENTURE, DREAM

41
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,034
BIG, PUSH FURTHER, SAIL

42
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:28,568
FASTER.

43
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:29,769
NEVER STOP REACHING FOR

44
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:31,238
GREATNESS.

45
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:31,905
>> Kimberly: MEANWHILE, THE

46
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:32,739
PRESIDENT IS LEAVING THE

47
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,241
DOOR OPEN TO RESCHEDULING

48
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:35,175
THE CANCELLED SUMMIT WITH

49
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:36,776
NORTH KOREA'S KIM JONG UN.

50
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:38,645
THIS AFTER THE ROGUE REGIME

51
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:39,546
SAYS THEY ARE STILL WILLING

52
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:41,181
TO MEET WITH TRUMP AT THIS

53
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:42,415
POINT IN TIME.

54
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:44,184
>>

55
00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:44,551
AT ANY

56
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:44,851
TIME.

57
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:46,319
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

58
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,354
WE ARE TALKING TO THEM NOW.

59
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:48,455
IT WAS A VERY NICE STATEMENT

60
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:49,522
THEY PUT OUT.

61
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:51,591
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

62
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:52,893
IT COULD EVEN BE THE 12TH.

63
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:54,194
WE ARE TALKING TO THEM NOW.

64
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:55,295
THEY VERY MUCH WANT TO DO

65
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:55,562
IT.

66
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:56,596
WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IT.

67
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:58,765
WE ARE GOING TO SEE WHAT

68
00:01:58,765 --> 00:01:59,165
HAPPENS.

69
00:01:59,165 --> 00:01:59,766
>> Kimberly: OKAY, GREG.

70
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,134
SO GIVING A ROUSING SPEECH.

71
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:03,570
WERE YOU PREPARED FOR THAT?

72
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,538
YOU SEEM STUNNED.

73
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:06,206
>> Greg: TRYING TO FIGURE

74
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:08,508
OUT WHAT I SHOULD TALK ABOUT

75
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,577
NORTH KOREA OR THE AMAZING

76
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:11,378
COMMENCEMENT SPEECH.

77
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:12,812
A COMMENCEMENT SPEECH FOR

78
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:13,914
THE REST OF AMERICA.

79
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:15,582
HE IS SPEAKING A LANGUAGE

80
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:16,950
THAT EVERYONE AROUND THE

81
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,218
WORLD UNDERSTANDS, INCLUDING

82
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:19,152
OUR ADVERSARIES.

83
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:20,420
SO WHEN HE SAYS STUFF THAT

84
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,788
IS CONVEYING AMERICA FIRST

85
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:23,156
AND WE'RE BACK AND WE'RE

86
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:24,491
GREAT, IT'S KIND OF MEANT

87
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:25,191
FOR RUSSIA.

88
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:26,760
IT'S MEANT FOR CHINA.

89
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,794
IT'S MEANT FOR NORTH KOREA.

90
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:29,863
IT'S MEANT FOR EVERYBODY WHO

91
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:30,563
ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS IT.

92
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:32,465
I KNOW IT WORKS BECAUSE IT

93
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:34,434
UPSETS THE ELITES WHO

94
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:39,172
PREFER, YOU KNOW, THE VLACID

95
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:40,407
LEXICON OF THE POLITICAL

96
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:41,074
PLATITUDES THAT HE DOESN'T

97
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:41,775
TRAFFIC IN.

98
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:43,143
SO I THINK THE REST OF THE

99
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:44,344
WORLD GETS IT.

100
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:47,814
EVEN IF MORNING JOE DOESN'T

101
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:49,416
HE HAS HIJACKED THE BULL

102
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,183
HORN.

103
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:51,751
BEFORE, HOLLYWOOD WAS WHAT

104
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:52,485
TRANSMITTED OUR VALUES

105
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:53,320
AROUND THE WORLD.

106
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,888
AND IT SEEMS LIKE HE HAS

107
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:56,389
TAKEN THE BULL HORN AND SAYS

108
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:57,958
NO, MY TURN.

109
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:58,458
>> Kimberly: OKAY.

110
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,492
THERE YOU GO.

111
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:03,763
GUTFELD SHOW GETS IT SUNDAY

112
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:06,933
SHOW GETS IT JUST NOT

113
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,835
MORNING JOE.

114
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:09,769
>> Kimberly: AMERICA FIRST.

115
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,905
VERY WELL RECEIVED VETS.

116
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:12,439
>> Jesse: VERY WELL

117
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:12,806
RECEIVED.

118
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:14,207
HE SPENT HOURS AFTERWARDS

119
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:15,208
SHAKING HANDS WITH ALL THE

120
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:15,642
CADETS.

121
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:17,043
HE LOVES THESE PEOPLE IN

122
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:17,377
UNIFORM.

123
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:18,211
HE HAS A SPECIAL

124
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:19,279
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S.

125
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:19,646
MILITARY.

126
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:20,947
HE IS FUNDING THEM TO

127
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:22,082
HEIGHTS THAT WE HAVE NEVER

128
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:23,817
SEEN BEFORE TO BUILD FASTER

129
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,885
PLANES AND FASTER SHIPS AND

130
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:27,654
MORE MASSIVE NUCLEAR

131
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:28,688
WARHEADS, JUAN.

132
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:31,758
SO, THE AMERICAN MILITARY IS

133
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:32,058
BACK.

134
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:32,959
HE RECOGNIZES IT.

135
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,227
IT'S NICE FOR THE COUNTRY TO

136
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:36,596
SEE A PRESIDENT WHO

137
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:37,731
100 PERCENT SUPPORTS THE MEN

138
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:38,765
AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY.

139
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:39,966
AND HE SAID SOMETHING WHICH

140
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:40,734
IS VERY SMART.

141
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:41,801
YOU WANT TO BUILD THE

142
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:42,969
MILITARY UP TO STRONGLY THAT

143
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,471
YOU NEVER HAVE TO USE IT AND

144
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,772
I THINK THAT'S THE MESSAGE

145
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:46,072
THERE.

146
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:47,540
WHEN IT COMES TO NORTH

147
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,675
KOREA, IT'S CLASSIC LIKE YOU

148
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,210
SAID YESTERDAY, ART OF THE

149
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:50,510
DEAL.

150
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,044
HE IS MOVING.

151
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:51,978
HE IS SHAKING.

152
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,446
IS HE ZIGGING AND ZAGGING.

153
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:56,149
THE WHOLE TIME THE PEANUT

154
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:58,284
GALLERY IS TRYING TO THROW

155
00:03:58,284 --> 00:04:00,020
SPIT BALLS AT HIM.

156
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,820
WAIT 24 HOURS AND NORTH

157
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,821
KOREA COMES BEGGING BACK TO

158
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:02,222
THE TABLE.

159
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:04,090
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE MORE

160
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,924
DESPERATE TO SIT DOWN WITH

161
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:06,059
THE PRESIDENT THAN IS HE TO

162
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:06,926
SIT DOWN WITH THEM.

163
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:08,728
HE CLEARLY HAS THE YOU WERE

164
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:10,263
HAND AND, LIKE WE SAID, WE

165
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:11,097
WILL WAIT AND SEE WHAT

166
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:12,832
HAPPENS IN SINGAPORE.

167
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:13,767
>> Kimberly: THERE YOU GO.

168
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:14,234
KENNEDY, HELLO.

169
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:14,901
>> HI THERE.

170
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:16,435
IT'S A REALLY FUNNY CONTRAST

171
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:17,070
WITH HILLARY CLINTON.

172
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,438
THESE ARE TOO VASTLY

173
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:18,971
DIFFERENT SPEECHES.

174
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:20,406
THIS MAY BE THE ONLY HIGH

175
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:21,408
PROFILE SPEECH A

176
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:22,509
CONSERVATIVE GIVES AT A

177
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:24,277
COLLEGE COMMENCEMENT THIS

178
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:24,611
YEAR.

179
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,547
AND, OF COURSE, AT THE

180
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:28,982
MILITARY ACADEMY ANNAPOLIS

181
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:29,916
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING

182
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:30,984
TO BE HECKLED.

183
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,852
AND THAT ALSO HAS TO BE

184
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:33,253
REFRESHING.

185
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:35,321
IT IS A HAND-PICKED VENUE

186
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:36,790
AND RECEPTIVE AUDIENCE.

187
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,691
BUT THESE SPEECHES ARE SO

188
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:39,325
DIFFERENT BECAUSE HILLARY

189
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:41,227
CLINTON JUST A WEEK AGO AT

190
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:43,430
YALE WAS SCREECHING TO A

191
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,165
VERY BORED AUDIENCE I'M

192
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:46,366
STILL NOT OVER IT AND THE

193
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:48,134
PRESIDENT IS ABLE TO GIVE A

194
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:49,702
MORE FORWARD-LOOKING SPEECH,

195
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:51,237
WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE

196
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:52,705
WITH SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES

197
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:54,674
THAT HE ADDRESSES AND TALKS

198
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:55,475
ABOUT.

199
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:56,643
AND, YES, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY

200
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:57,010
RIGHT.

201
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,378
INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT

202
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:00,346
HIMSELF AND A PAINFUL LOSS

203
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:02,248
AND RELIVING GROUNDHOG DAY

204
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:04,484
EVERY SINGLE DAY, HE IS

205
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:05,785
TELEGRAPHING TO NORTH KOREA

206
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:07,353
AND RUSSIA AND CHINA AND

207
00:05:07,353 --> 00:05:09,422
ALSO GETS TO TALK A LITTLE

208
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:11,558
BIT ABOUT HIS AGENDA.

209
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:12,592
SO, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T THINK

210
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:13,760
WE WERE GOING TO BE TALKING

211
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,129
AT ALL THIS YEAR ABOUT

212
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:17,430
COMMENCEMENT SPEECH THAT

213
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,265
WASN'T COMPLETELY BUBBLE

214
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:22,569
WRAPPED AND GROUP THINK.

215
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,971
FOR THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT

216
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:25,438
REFRESHING.

217
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:26,539
>> Kimberly: A LOT OF PEOPLE

218
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:27,240
ENJOYED THIS ONE.

219
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,911
I HOPE YOU DID, TOO.

220
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:32,579
>> Juan: INTERESTING TO ME

221
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:33,947
COME AND LISTEN TO YOU GUYS

222
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:34,948
A COUPLE PROTESTERS.

223
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,250
I DON'T THINK A WHOLE LOT.

224
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,319
>> Jesse: THOSE ARE FOR YOU,

225
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:39,686
JUAN.

226
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:40,753
>> Juan: INSIDE THE KIDS

227
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:42,522
WERE PRETTY RESPECTFUL.

228
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:43,923
INSIDE YOU CALL IT ROUSING.

229
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:45,091
I'M INTERESTED.

230
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:46,292
LET ME JUST SAY THIS SPEECH

231
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:49,062
WAS ABOUT AMERICA FIRST.

232
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:50,230
IT WAS WRAPPED IN

233
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,630
PATRIOTISM.

234
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,531
HE WRAPPED HIMSELF IN THE

235
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:51,831
FLAG.

236
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:52,932
HE WRAPPED HIMSELF IN THE

237
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:53,299
MILITARY.

238
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:55,301
I THINK THAT'S, JESSE, WHY

239
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,035
HE SPENT TIME.

240
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:57,504
HE WANTS THEM AND THEIR

241
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:58,671
STAMP OF APPROVAL AND THEIR

242
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:00,240
HIGH APPROVAL RATINGS AMONG

243
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,040
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO

244
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,175
TRANSFER TO HIM.

245
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,710
BUT, WHEN YOU THINK.

246
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,410
>> Jesse: DO YOU THINK IS HE

247
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,778
GIVING A ROUSING PATRIOTIC

248
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:06,713
SPEECH BECAUSE HE WANTS TO

249
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:09,916
BOOST HIS APPROVAL RATING?

250
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:10,416
>> Juan: YES.

251
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,318
>> Kimberly: THROUGH THE

252
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:12,752
CADETS?

253
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:13,486
>> Juan: LET'S LOOK AT THE

254
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:14,254
SUBSTANCE OF IT.

255
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:15,688
WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT OH,

256
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:16,823
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE

257
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:17,757
MILITARY STRONGER AND ALL

258
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:18,691
THAT WAIT A MINUTE, OUR

259
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:19,592
MILITARY IS THE STRONGEST IN

260
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:21,327
THE WORLD.

261
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:21,961
>> Jesse: WE'RE GOING TO

262
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:22,829
MAKE IT EVEN STRONGER,

263
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:25,498
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

264
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:26,666
>> Kimberly: REBUILDING IT.

265
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,367
>> Juan: SUGGESTING SOMEBODY

266
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:29,335
DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THEM.

267
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:29,936
MILITARY.

268
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:32,105
OBAMA, BUSH, CLINTON?

269
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:32,739
>> Kimberly: IT WAS UNDER

270
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:35,608
FUND YOU

271
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:35,642
FUNDEDOU

272
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:35,975
FUNDED.U

273
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:40,813
UNDER FUNDED UNDER OBAMA.

274
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:42,015
>> Juan: THAT IS ECHO IN THE

275
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:42,582
CONSERVATIVE CHAMBER.

276
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:43,683
THE FACT IS WE HAVE A

277
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:45,185
MILITARY THAT SUNDAY IFED

278
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:46,819
AT -- I THINK THE TOP 20

279
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:47,720
OTHER MILITARIES IN THE

280
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,222
WORLD DON'T HAVE AS MUCH

281
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:52,659
FUNDING AS OUR MILITARY.

282
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:53,726
>> Kennedy: CAN I JUST SAY

283
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:54,994
THIS?

284
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:56,162
JUAN, LET ME ME AGREE WITH

285
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:56,896
YOU ON SOMETHING.

286
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,398
I DO THINK WE SPEND AN AWFUL

287
00:06:58,398 --> 00:06:59,499
LOT OF MONEY ON THE

288
00:06:59,499 --> 00:06:59,866
MILITARY.

289
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,434
I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

290
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:02,168
RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP

291
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:03,636
THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE COULD

292
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:05,104
LOOK AT CUTTING COSTS IN THE

293
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:06,039
MILITARY WITHOUT MAKING OUR

294
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,540
COUNTRY LESS SAFE AND

295
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,275
WITHOUT COMPROMISING OUR

296
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:10,977
PATRIOTISM AND THE DEBT OF

297
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,445
GRATITUDE THAT WE OWE TO MEN

298
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:13,846
AND WOMEN WHO WEAR THE

299
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:14,180
UNIFORM.

300
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,748
BUT, ALSO, BEING SUPPORTIVE

301
00:07:15,748 --> 00:07:16,916
OF THE MILITARY DOESN'T JUST

302
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,185
MEAN WRITING THEM A BLANK

303
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:19,719
CHECK.

304
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:21,254
>> Juan: I AGREE.

305
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:22,589
>> Greg: CAN I JUST RESPOND?

306
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:23,690
JUAN, WHEN YOU QUESTION

307
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,357
SOMEBODY'S PATRIOTISM.

308
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:25,291
THAT MEANS YOU CAN READ

309
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:25,792
THEIR MIND.

310
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,460
IF SOMEBODY IS ACTUALLY

311
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,528
EXPRESSING A LOVE FOR A

312
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:29,562
COUNTRY, CAN YOU SAY OH,

313
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:30,964
THAT'S JUST -- HE IS TRYING

314
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:32,165
TO PLAY TO THIS AUDIENCE.

315
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:36,469
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

316
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:38,404
IT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT TO

317
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:39,872
SAY -- YOU CLAIM YOU CAN

318
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:41,140
READ HIS MIND.

319
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,975
>> Juan: DID I NOT.

320
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,243
>> YEAH, YOU DID.

321
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:45,511
YOU BASICALLY SAID IT WAS

322
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:47,113
ALL AN APP. HE WAS WRAPPING

323
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:47,814
HIMSELF IN THE FLAG.

324
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:48,915
MAYBE HE LOVES AMERICA.

325
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:49,816
BUT YOU ARE RIDING HIS MIND

326
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:51,651
WHEN YOU ARE SAYING OH, HE

327
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:52,986
IS WRAPPING YOUR --

328
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:54,020
BASICALLY SAYING I KNOW WHAT

329
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,154
HE IS REALLY DOING.

330
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:56,122
JUAN JAWNEL I LISTENED TO

331
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,123
THE SPEECH.

332
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,125
THE MAN IS TALKING AMERICA

333
00:07:59,125 --> 00:07:59,492
FIRST.

334
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:00,126
>> Kimberly: WHAT'S WRONG

335
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:01,094
WITH THAT.

336
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:02,729
>> Juan: NO MORE APOLOGIES,

337
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:03,863
WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT

338
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:04,330
AMERICA FIRST.

339
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,898
HOW IS THIS LOOKED AT AROUND

340
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:07,333
THE WORLD IT'S NOT MIND

341
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,334
READING IT'S LISTENING.

342
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:09,936
WHAT HE SAID WALLS.

343
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,904

344
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:12,405
INTERPRETING.

345
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,072
>> Juan: LET ME SPEAK FOR A

346
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:13,406

357
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:20,179
OF THE WORLD HEAR AMERICA NO

00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:22,482
LONGER AS THE GLOBAL LEADER

359
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:25,251
IS HE RETRENCHING AND

360
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,352
PULLING BACK AND SAYING

361
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:27,387
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK OUT FOR

362
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:28,054
AMERICA FIRST.

363
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:29,822
AMERICA IS SUPPOSED TO BE A

364
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:30,923
WORLD LEADER.

365
00:08:30,923 --> 00:08:31,491
>> Kimberly: HE IS THE

366
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,191
PRESIDENT THE UNITED STATES

367
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:34,460
OF AMERICA.

368
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:34,961
>> Juan: YES.

369
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:35,561
>> Kimberly: HE IS NOT

370
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:37,263
PRESIDENT OF NORTH KOREA.

371
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:37,964
>> Juan: NO, WE ARE INVOLVED

372
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:39,599
THERE BECAUSE WE HAVE

373
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,568
INTEREST IN ASIA.

374
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:44,203
>> Kimberly: WHY CAN'T HE

375
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:45,471
LOOK AT AMERICA FIRST WHAT

376
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,607
CAN I DO TO IMPROVE THE MEN

377
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:48,741
AND WOMEN OF THE MILITARY

378
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:50,143
THAT SERVE VALIANTLY BY

379
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:51,010
MAKING SURE THEY ARE TAKEN

380
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,212
CARE OF, BY MAKING

381
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:54,580
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE V.A.?

382
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,848
LOOKING INWARD TO BE ABLE TO

383
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:56,816

STRONGER AND BETTER AS A

387
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:01,821
NATION.

388
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:02,488
CONTEND KENNEDY ISN'T THAT

389
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:04,157
ONE THE ARGUMENTS OF THE

390
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:04,857
ANTIWAR LEFT THAT PRESIDENT

391
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:06,426

HAVE SPENT SO MUCH MONEY

393
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:08,561
OVERSEAS.

394
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:09,829
WE HAVE NEEDLESSLY SPENT

395
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:10,697
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE

396
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:11,297
MIDDLE EAST.

397
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:12,699
WHY SHOULDN'T WOULD HE BE

398
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:13,499
INVESTING IT HERE?

399
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:14,400
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU

400
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,835
WOULD HEAR ELIZABETH WARREN

401
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:18,404
OR BERNIE SANDERS SAY.

402
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:19,238
>> Juan: I AGREE.

403
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:20,006

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:24,877
TO THE WORLD IS, I'M GOING

408
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:25,912
TO PULL OUT OF AGREEMENTS

409
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:27,347
LIKE THE IRAN DEAL OR THE

410
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:29,449
CLIMATE DEAL.

411
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:30,650
ASIA DEAL IN TERMS OF

412
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:30,983
MARKETS.

00:09:30,983 --> 00:09:32,185
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO

414
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:32,585
RENEGOTIATE.

415
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:33,386
I'M A DEALMAKER.

416
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:34,887
AND I'M GOING TO CREATE SOME

417
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:35,688
CHAOS HERE.

418
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:36,823
WHAT DOES THE REST OF THE

419
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:37,857

IF YOU WANT TO BE LAST.

425
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:56,476
>> Juan: I'M NOT SAYING

426
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:56,843
THAT.

427
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:57,643

00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:11,290
ALONG TO GET ALONG LIKE

437
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,026
OTHER PRESIDENTS.

438
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:16,229
>> Juan: LIKE PRINTING COINS

439
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:18,965
LIKE TRUMP AND KIM ON THEM?

440
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,967
>> Jesse: IS HE A BIG

441
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:21,401
INVESTOR.

442
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,202

445
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:28,141
CLIMATE DEAL WOULD HAVE COST

446
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:29,375
100 TRILLION OVER A CENTURY.

447
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,810
GOOD TO PULL OUT OF THAT

448
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,645
IRAN, WE KNOW BEN RHODES WAS

449
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:33,880
SO BAD HE HAD TO LIE ABOUT

450
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,947
THIS DEAL TO AMERICA.

451
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:36,115
WE NOW KNOW IT'S BAD.

452
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:37,150
THIRD THING GOING ON RIGHT

453
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,884

FIRST, YOU MUST BE SHOCKED

459
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:44,590
BY THE SUNRISE.

460
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,159
THIS IS HOW NEGOTIATIONS GO.

461
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,059
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME

462
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:50,596
