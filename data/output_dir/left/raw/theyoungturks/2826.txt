1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,140
RIGHT NOW THE WHITE HOUSE IS
CONSIDERING LAUNCHING A

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,519
PREEMPTIVE ATTACK ON
NORTH KOREA.

3
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:10,100
BUT DON'T WORRY, WE'RE PRETTY
SURE IT WON'T LEAD TO A

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,020
NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:19,710
THAT IS THE RHETORIC THEY ARE
USING TO DEFEND THIS PLAN.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:30,170
UNFORTUNATELY THAT COULD BE

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,000
FOLLOWED BY THE PRICE WE CAN ALL
PAY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE'S

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:51,330
BEHAVIOR.

9
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,469
SO THEY WANT TO USE THE PRETEXT
OF SOME SORT OF TEST TO ATTACK

10
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:01,649
NORTH KOREA AND THE GAMBLE IS
THAT HE WILL NOT RESPOND IN THE

11
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,460
WAY THAT YOU MIGHT THINK
HE MIGHT.

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,240
CERTAINLY STATEMENTS FROM THE
NORTH KOREAN REGIME IMPLY THAT

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,520
ANY SORT OF ATTACK WILL BE

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,570
INTERPRETED AS WAR, AND THAT
COULD HAVE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES.

15
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,270
LET'S GO OVER SOME
NUMBERS REAL FAST.

16
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,340
IN MANY CASES AREAS HAVE BEEN ñ
YOU DON'T NEED ANY MISSILES OR

17
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,340
NUKES.

18
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,171
THEY CAN REIGN HOW LONG THE SOUL
AND KILL HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN A

19
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,171
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

20
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,171
THE ALSO PREDICTED COULD
EVENTUALLY BRING CHINA, RUSSIA,

21
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,171
AND JAPAN INTO THE MIX WHICH

22
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,171
WOULD HAVE HUGE ADDITIONAL
NUMBERS OF CASUALTIES.

23
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:30,171
THAT IS IF THERE IS NO
NUCLEAR RESPONSE.

24
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:31,171
THEY ARE SAYING THEY WILL
RESPOND.

25
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,171
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
THIS WOULD ACCOMPLISH?

26
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:33,171
I KNOW IN

27
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:34,171
TRUMP'S MIND HE THINKS THIS WILL

28
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:35,171
SCARE NORTH KOREA OFF.

29
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,171
IT WILL DE-ESCALATE THE
SITUATION SOMEHOW, BUT I DON'T

30
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:37,171
THINK THAT IS THE CASE.

31
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:38,171
IT DOESN'T SEEM AS THOUGH KIM
JONG UN IS COMPLETELY

32
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:39,171
UNAWARE.

33
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:40,171
I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A POINT
ABOUT HOW ALL OF THE MEDIA.

34
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:41,670
THEY MAKE IT SEEM AS A TRUMPET
SITTING THERE HAVING

35
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,670
NEGOTIATIONS WITH MATTIS, HR

36
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,670
MCMASTER AND TILLER SEND.

37
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,270
WE TALKED ABOUT HIS SCHEDULE
YESTERDAY, HE IS NOT IN THE

38
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,870
NITTY-GRITTY OF THE SITUATION.

39
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,360
MY FEAR IS THAT HE WILL MAKE AN
UNEDUCATED, UNINFORMED DECISION

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,620
THAT COULD LEAD TO A LOT OF
PEOPLE LOSING THEIR LIVES.

41
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,200
I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,320
ONE OF THE COMMENTATORS I READ
SAID IT WOULD REALLY HARM KIM

43
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,420
JONG UN'S UNDERSTANDING ñ
IS INTERNATIONAL STANDING.

44
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,420
LIKE THAT HIS STANDING, PEOPLE
TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY AS A

45
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,240
RESULT OF TRUMP CARRYING OUT
THIS ATTACK.

46
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
DEFINITELY.

47
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,600
WHAT HE HAS TO EXERT INFLUENCE
IS THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE.

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,549
IF HE'S GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO
USE IT AND CHOOSES NOT TO,

49
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:15,530
DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE COULD IN
THE FUTURE BUT HE WOULD LOSE

50
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,950
SOME OF THAT THREATENING
PRESENCE.

51
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,430
IF HE CHOOSES TO RESPOND TO IT
IT DOES LEAD TO ALL-OUT WAR, HE

52
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,540
WILL LIKELY DIE ALONG WITH MOST
OF THE PEOPLE IN NORTH KOREA.

53
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,499
THE TIMING OF ALL OF THIS
SEEMS STRANGE.

54
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:28,109
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
THEY READ A BOOK.

55
00:02:28,109 --> 00:04:57,610
THIS IS THE KIND OF DESTRUCTION
THAT 

56
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,300
PRESIDENTS HAVE DONE TO

57
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,370
KEEP YOUR MIND OFF OF WHAT
IS HAPPENING.

58
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,370
YOU ARE RIGHT.

59
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,919
THAT'S WHY MEANT WHEN I SAID
STRANGE.

60
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:12,710
AND REMEMBER THIS IS

61
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,810
HAPPENING WHILE NORTH KOREA AND
SOUTH KOREA ARE FINALLY TALKING

62
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,620
AND NEGOTIATING WITH ONE
ANOTHER.

63
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,900
LATER ON WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW
NORTH KOREA IS GOING TO SEND

64
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,780
SOME OF ITS ATHLETES TO SOUTH
KOREA FOR THE OLYMPICS, AND

65
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,069
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN TRUMP
COMES OUT WITH THIS.

66
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:35,360
THE COUNTRIES YOU MENTIONED,
RUSSIA, CHINA, THEY DIDN'T

67
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,560
MENTION JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA.

68
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,889
SOUTH KOREA HAS THE MOST TO
LOSE, WITH THE FIRST DIRECT

69
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:43,240
RESPONSE WOULD COME.

70
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,020
I THINK THE IMPLIED IDEA IS
THAT IN ADDITION CHINA,

71
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,530
RUSSIA, AND JAPAN COULD BE
BROUGHT IN.

72
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,590
WE DON'T HAVE AN AMBASSADOR
TO SOUTH KOREA OR ANYONE WHO CAN

73
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,710
CALL UP AND GET ON THE STATE

74
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,819
DEPARTMENT PHONE AND TELL REX
TILLERSON I KNOW YOU ARE NOT

75
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:05,780
PUSHING FOR THIS BUT YOU HAVE TO
STOP THIS BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT

76
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,409
IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

77
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:13,289
WE ARE WOEFULLY UNDERMANNED AND
UNDER WOMANED IN THE STATE

78
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:19,069
DEPARTMENT ON ANOTHER PART THAT

79
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:24,560
IS UNDER DISCUSSED IS WHAT IT
MEANS ABOUT THE WAY HE IS

80
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,569
GETTING HIS INFORMATION.

81
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:28,870
WE SHOULD NOT KNOW THAT MCMASTER
AND TILLERSON SAYING THIS.

82
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:38,789
IT IS LIKELY ONE OF THOSE THREE.

83
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:43,750
FORGET WHO THE PRESIDENT IS
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS

84
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,949
TERRIBLE.

85
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:47,830
BASICALLY I THINK THIS IS A
GREAT CASE STUDY FOR WHAT WAS

86
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,331
REVEALED IN FIRE AND FURY AND

87
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:50,370
HOW THEY ACTUAL OPERATE.

88
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:56,740
HE IS NOT A PERSON WITH
LOTS OF HIS OWN.

89
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,590
YOU GET THESE FACTIONS THAT ARE
DUKING IT OUT, ALL OF THEM

90
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,849
USING LEAKING AT VARIOUS POINTS
TO ADVANCE THEIR AGENDA.

91
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:09,490
IT COULD BE THAT HR MCMASTER
IS LEAKING THIS.

92
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:16,389
TO GIVE THE VIEW THAT IT IS A
SERIOUS WHITE HOUSE OR IT COULD

93
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:20,370
BE THAT REX TILLERSON OR MATTIS
COULD BE LEAKING THIS TO GET

94
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,889
PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION SO HE

95
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,590
WILL BACK OFF.

96
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,870
VERY OFTEN TRUMPETERS HAVE THE
CYCLICAL SORT OF THOUGHTS AND

97
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,520
BRING SOMETHING UP BECAUSE
HE'S FRUSTRATED.

98
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,900
AND THEY PROBABLY HAVE BEEN
ATTEMPTING TO DISSUADE HIM

99
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,270
FROM STARTING A NUCLEAR
HOLOCAUST.

100
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,809
THEY COULD BE THIS IS THE MOST
RECENT WAY TO TRY TO STEP HIM

101
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:45,809
OFF OF THAT.

102
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:48,689
IS IT LIKELY THAT ON ANY GIVEN
DAY HE WILL LAUNCH AN ATTACK?

103
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:49,689
PERHAPS NOT.

104
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:52,180
BUT WE KNOW THAT HE CAN BE
SPARKED BY SOMETHING.

105
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,620
IF TOMORROW NORTH KOREA TEST
ANOTHER MISSILE, MAYBE THAT

106
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,389
WILL CAUSE THEM TO WANT
TO ATTACK.

107
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:03,080
IS POSSIBLE IT IS JUST A
DISTRACTION AND MAYBE WE SPENT

108
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,469
TOO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT, BUT
IT IS A TOPIC IN WHICH HUNDREDS

109
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:11,440
OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES
ARE ON THE LINE.

110
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,759
IT IS ALSO TERRIFYING TO KNOW
THAT THIS IS EITHER IN THE BACK

111
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,409
OF THE FRONT OF TRUMP'S MIND AND
IF THERE IS ANY PROVOCATION

112
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:26,059
FROM NORTH KOREA THIS IS A
POSSIBILITY.

113
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:32,799
WE ARE DEALING WITH TWO
COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT

114
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,799
RATIONAL ACTORS.

115
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,908
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THAT
ABOUT THE UNITED STATES

116
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:41,909
PRESIDENT, BUT HE IS NOT A
RATIONAL ACTOR.

117
00:08:41,909 --> 00:00:00,000
THE FORMER CEO OF EXXON CAN
TALK SENSE INTO HIM I HOPE.
