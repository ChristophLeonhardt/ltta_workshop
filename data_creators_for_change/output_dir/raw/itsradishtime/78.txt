00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
hi friends I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dancer since age</font>

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">three it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something to which I'm</font>

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,560
genetically predisposed even the last

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,269
four weeks that I've gone without a

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,280
dance class make me feel a little

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,460
unclear a key from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very beginning I</font>

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,590
crave the movement and the stage lights

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,869
and the music at regular intervals but

9
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,170
more than anything I wanted tap shoes

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,480
the black patent leather shiny tap shoes

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,070
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ribbon ties that might click</font>

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,630
click click the high heels<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wasn't</font>

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">old enough to wear every day until I was</font>

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,769
deemed ready for tap class I wanted

15
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,380
those freaking tap shoes and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,600
them i laced them on and all their

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,760
reflective glory and clicked into my

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">first class and something shifted it</font>

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,110
wasn't long before I started feeling a

20
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,969
little ping of dread every time I stuff

21
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to clean leotard into a duffel bag that</font>

22
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,050
meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had dance after school I wanted</font>

23
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,449
so badly to quit but my mom was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dancer</font>

24
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,100
herself wouldn't let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me off the hook</font>

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,140
that easy she made me<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep going for the</font>

26
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,109
next couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and I would just</font>

27
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:59,820
sloppily drag myself around the studio

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,340
like I had some sort of weird parasite

29
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,920
it was those damn shiny shoes they

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked so pretty but whenever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i laced</font>

31
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,380
them up it meant that I had to be

32
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,119
subjected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a dance that was tiny and</font>

33
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,040
precise and more counting than feeling

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,619
and totally not for me I've always been

35
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,049
a greedy<font color="#CCCCCC"> little magpie I've done stuff</font>

36
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,270
for the shiny thing all the time I got

37
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">my first communion in Catholic school</font>

38
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost entirely because the religious ed</font>

39
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,880
textbook had a gold foil cover never got

40
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,460
confirmed there was no shiny thing and I

41
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,020
know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not alone because I hear so</font>

42
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,970
many people talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how hard it is to</font>

43
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,619
stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivated after school when there's</font>

44
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,780
no more gold stars or trophies or

45
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,579
diplomas hanging just past the next

46
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">checkpoint to validate them but really</font>

47
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,060
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think of it chasing the shiny</font>

48
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,700
thing has more<font color="#E5E5E5"> often than not kept me in</font>

49
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,770
something way longer than I wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

50
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,229
it's not bad to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bail on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font>

51
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">not for you and go find something better</font>

52
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,399
even if the better<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing doesn't come</font>

53
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,619
with applause or money or a pair of

54
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,830
black patent leather<font color="#CCCCCC"> clicky shoes so</font>

55
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,630
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comments what's</font>
