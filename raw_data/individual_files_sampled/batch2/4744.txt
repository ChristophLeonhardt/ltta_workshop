there are 29 days until the midterms and for people who want to avoid this tense political season you can always escape with a trip to the movies but the Trump era has more movies turning political like the new movie Theo starring Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz who's mostly known for comedy like playing an imposing Russian baseball player on HBO's eastbound and down or of course as nurse Morgan and the mindy project on hulu but in the oath Ike taps his pedigree is a funny relatable guy to get people to relate to the very serious prospect of American democracy slowly caving in under the pressure of a creeping authoritarian administration pressing citizens to sign a loyalty pledge and his character grows frustrated as seemingly normal people around him accept those tactics and soothe themselves with false conspiracy theories they read online and the deadline for the oath comes after Thanksgiving which leaves Ike's character at war with his family over the holidays you know what I don't want to eat with you people so I'm gonna take my food and my wine I'm gonna go sit in my car in the driveway and I'm gonna listen to some news and I'm gonna read little articles on my phone and eat my food and you all can sit here at the table and stuff your big fat faces and talk about the people that are being brutally executed in the street by our police state I'll be in the driveway happy things to be here on the beat is Ike Barinholtz who not only stars in the oath but also wrote and directed happy holidays everybody happy holidays I just want to say my character and eastbound and down I don't know if you heard was recently indicted in the Muller Pro it was he was at Trump Tower it was at the meeting Ivan de chenko and was he being paid by alpha bank he was it's amazing I'm worried about him is this really Pete Williams mug this is Scotch that that's your mug now and I don't think a Christmas gift for my dad do you want to be pen while you're going to the merge I'm just gonna take a couple of these if I have a lot of family that are fans of the show so now I just not got a little holiday shopping thanks Ari ah you're a funny guy thank you eastbound and down and a lot of your other stuffs not political why'd you go political here what are you trying to say well I think everything's political now I think in years past especially when it came to the holiday table you can kind of sidestep politics and Piven to other things like football can't do that anymore hmm TV yeah you can't really get into that too much so you know I just feel like it's permeated kind of every layer that we have and I was actually after the election that after that Thanksgiving my mom and my brother and I got in this huge fight about about the election during Thanksgiving dinner and I thought to myself if we all voted for the same person what's happening at other holiday tables in countries I wanted to explore that I knew that arena was changed you and your mom both voted for Jill Stein we both wanted for Jill Stein got it and we contributed I put in my entire 401k to the recount effort for her and we're still waiting to hear Jill if you're watching return an email please but no I you know we wanted to make a movie that explored the holiday table and kind of this tense political stress we're all feeling and kind of blow it all up some political movies when Hollywood get to hold of them are quite vague no more generic this one feels very now let's look at the scene where you're tapping exactly into the mag a trump supporter world where people don't need legitimate fact-checking sometimes they rely on anything they found online take a look unbelievable what did he do nothing mommy didn't do anything he didn't do nothing he lit a copy of the oath on fire in front of some constituents and who are you getting this information from patreon okay yeah well he's he's a good source a fatass patriot he's verified why'd you put that in you know my character in the movie a lot of the characters in the movie are obsessed with the kind of you know 24 hour news cycle and and I just wanted to show kind of how too much of it coming from two different too many disparate sources can kind of confuse us and make us crazy and yeah that was how I was feeling it's still how I feel right now so I wanted to kind of just make fun of that but we really do make fun of kind of the entire spectrum of the movie it's not just you know I personally am liberal but I think if I admit a movie were like the liberal guy was this hero and he was a great guy that borings let's dig in on that because in this film a lot of people who are critical of Trump will see in it an endorsement of the concern that you can't let little steps towards authoritarianism add up that that is dangerous what would you think Trump supporters might take from your movie on a basic level I think they would like that I portrayed the liberal guys kind of an insufferable you know know-it-all who was willing to kind of throw out the baby with the bathwater so to speak but I think unless you're like super super dug in and the far far right or even the far far left for that matter I think you'll watch this movie and you first and foremost you'll laugh you'll be scared but the kind of the overall message of the movie is that we have a responsibility when it comes to like our family and our friends it's easy to be like on my uncle he's he's a trump gun I don't want to talk to him anymore that's easy the hard part is is keeping these relationships alive and intact and healthy enough so when the winds do blow the other way we still have some connections to other people who don't agree with this and this is the teracle final question what is the easiest thing to satirize about today's resistance and today's Trump crap for the Liberals it's easy to satirize panic even though it's a very real thing then that I feel as a liberal and I think it's easy on the right to satirize the the information that you're getting and the validity of it right and the difference between information and facts yes and not you know fake news what what we know is fake news which is I want to say this show having been here is real news this is real news behind you when you look behind as those are those real deaths so there's a real people this is not North Korea they are actually one guy was watching ice and YouTube clips but everyone else seems to be working Ike Barinholtz thanks for coming by the movie is the oath with Tiffany Haddish and it's out in select
