1
00:00:02,571 --> 00:00:03,437
WITHOUT POWER.

2
00:00:03,438 --> 00:00:04,739
>> Shannon: RICK REICHMUTH,

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,106
THANK YOU.

4
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:07,141
PRESIDENT TRUMP FRESH OF A RALLY

5
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:07,708
IN ERIE, PENNSYLVANIA,

6
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:08,743
MONITORING THE DEADLY STORM

7
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:09,744
MOVING TO THE SOUTHEAST COAST,

8
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:13,114
HE JOINS US NOW ON THE PHONE.

9
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:14,348
MR. PRESIDENT, WELCOME TO

10
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:14,882
"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT."

11
00:00:14,883 --> 00:00:15,616
>> President Trump: HI,

12
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:15,950
SHANNON.

13
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:17,485
>> Shannon: LET ME START BY

14
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:19,687
ASKING ABOUT THE HURRICANE

15
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:20,321
RESPONSE AND CORONATION.

16
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:22,156
I GREW UP IN THE PANHANDLE.

17
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:23,424
A LOT OF FOLKS I LOVE OR HATE

18
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:23,724
TODAY.

19
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:25,092
I KNOW YOU'VE TALKED TO SEVERAL

20
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:25,459
GOVERNORS.

21
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,996
HOW DOES IT LOOK?

22
00:00:28,997 --> 00:00:31,199
>> President Trump: IT WAS A

23
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,300
TOUGH WIND STORM.

24
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:33,601
THE WIND WAS PROBABLY MORE

25
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:35,102
DANGEROUS THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

26
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:36,304
I WAS LISTENING TO RICK.

27
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:37,805
THIRD OR FOURTH EVER IN RECORDED

28
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:39,140
HISTORY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

29
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:39,941
IT WAS.

30
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:41,676
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, WE DON'T

31
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:44,879
KNOW BECAUSE IT'S SO DARK.

32
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,379
ELECTRIC IS OUT.

33
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,484
WE HEAR THERE'S A LOT OF DAMAGE.

34
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:52,086
TREMENDOUS WIND DAMAGE, A LOT OF

35
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:53,354
THINGS BLOWN OVER.

36
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:54,655
HOPEFULLY NOT HOUSES WITH PEOPLE

37
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:55,156
IN THEM.

38
00:00:55,157 --> 00:00:56,290
>> Shannon: YOU ARE CRITICIZED

39
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,593
TONIGHT BY SOME FOR GOING TO THE

40
00:00:58,594 --> 00:00:59,193
RALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA.

41
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:00,294
I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO

42
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:04,465
RESPOND TO YOUR CRITICS.

43
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:05,298
>> President Trump: IF I

44
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,501
DIDN'T GO, THEY WOULD ALSO

45
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:08,102
CRITICIZE.

46
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:09,537
THIS WAS SET UP A LONG TIME AGO.

47
00:01:09,538 --> 00:01:12,106
WE HAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LINED

48
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:13,507
UP FROM YESTERDAY.

49
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:14,709
I MEAN LITERALLY THEY STAYED

50
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,110
24 HOURS AND SOMETIMES MORE THAN

51
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:17,912
THAT TO GO TO THESE RALLIES.

52
00:01:17,913 --> 00:01:19,313
THEY LIKE THEM.

53
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:21,515
YOU PROBABLY SAW THE PICTURES ON

54
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:22,116
TELEVISION TONIGHT.

55
00:01:22,117 --> 00:01:23,551
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

56
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:25,353
PEOPLE OUTSIDE AFTER THE ARENA.

57
00:01:25,354 --> 00:01:25,887
IT WAS A BIG ARENA.

58
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:29,323
BUT IT WAS FULL.

59
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:31,125
WE HAD 15 OR BEYOND THAT

60
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:32,960
THOUSAND PEOPLE OUTSIDE.

61
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:33,761
YOU HAVE THESE PEOPLE WAITING

62
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:36,497
FOR HOURS, MANY HOURS.

63
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:37,899
IF I DIDN'T GO, THAT WOULD HAVE

64
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,134
BEEN THE WRONG THING TOO.

65
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:42,003
MORE PORTLY THAN ANYTHING, WE

66
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:43,437
HAVE PEOPLE IN FLORIDA, PEOPLE

67
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:44,705
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

68
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:47,141
I HAD EVERYTHING SET UP ON

69
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:47,575
AIR FORCE ONE.

70
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:48,576
I WAS IN TOTAL COMMUNICATION.

71
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:53,114
I SPOKE WITH THE GOVERNORS OF

72
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:55,516
ALABAMA, THE GOVERNOR, AS YOU

73
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:56,684
KNOW, OF GEORGIA.

74
00:01:56,685 --> 00:01:57,618
I SPOKE WITH RICK SCOTT.

75
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,520
WE WERE IN CONSTANT

76
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,154
COMMUNICATION.

77
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:01,923
DID THE RALLY AND PEOPLE HAD A

78
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:02,723
FANTASTIC TIME.

79
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:03,925
WAS A VERY IMPORTANT RALLY

80
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:04,825
TONIGHT BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN

81
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:07,328
VERY UNFAIR TO HAVE PEOPLE

82
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:09,330
WAITING FOR TEN, 12, MORE THAN

83
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,530
THAT HOURS AND THEN SAVED BY THE

84
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:12,833
WAY, I'M NOT GOING TO BE THERE

85
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:13,167
TONIGHT.

86
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:14,168
STU AND MR. PRESIDENT, AS MUCH

87
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:16,671
AS THEY LIKE TO GO, YOU LIKE TO

88
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:17,004
GO TOO.

89
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:21,742
YOU LIKE TO BE CAMPAIGNING.

90
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,611
POLITICO HAD THIS HEADLINE

91
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:25,680
YESTERDAY.

92
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:26,714
G.O.P. HOUSES CRUMBLING.

93
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:28,482
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO TURNED OUT

94
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:29,984
FOR YOU IN 2016, ARE YOU

95
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:31,852
CONFIDENT THEY WILL SHOW UP IN

96
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:32,286
THE MIDTERMS?

97
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:32,920
>> President Trump: THAT'S

98
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:35,122
WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET OUT.

99
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:36,691
I GUESS PEOPLE LIKE ME BECAUSE

100
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:38,159
YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND YOU

101
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,927
SEE THE POLL NUMBERS.

102
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:43,731
52 TODAY, ONE OF THE BIG POLES.

103
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:45,132
THEY SAY THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

104
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,133
BEYOND THAT.

105
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:47,401
WHEN THEY HANG UP, THEY SAY

106
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:48,135
THAT'S A TRUMP MOTOR AND THAT'S

107
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:52,273
MY KIND OF PERSON.

108
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:54,008
I THINK WE ARE DOING REALLY

109
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:54,308
WELL.

110
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:56,811
LOOKING AT THE SENATE VOTES.

111
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:58,446
RACES THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO

112
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:00,281
CONTEST, WE ARE NOW WINNING.

113
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:01,749
IF YOU LOOK AT NORTH DAKOTA.

114
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,284
I COULD NAME FOUR OR FIVE OF

115
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:05,486
THEM BUT I DON'T WANT TO JINX

116
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:05,820
MYSELF.

117
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:07,288
MANY OF THE SENATE RACES WE

118
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:08,222
DIDN'T THINK WE WERE EVEN GOING

119
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:10,491
TO BE CONTESTING TO A LARGE

120
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:11,625
EXTENT, WE ARE NOW LEADING.

121
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:15,563
WE HAVE SOME GREAT CANDIDATES.

122
00:03:15,564 --> 00:03:16,931
VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE FINDING

123
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:18,366
THE SAME THING NOW WITH THE

124
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:18,666
HOUSE.

125
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:19,800
A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE

126
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:24,005
HORRIBLE ABUSE THAT NOW JUSTICE

127
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:25,473
KAVANAUGH SUFFERED LAST WEEK AT

128
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:28,709
THE HANDS OF THESE DEMOCRATS.

129
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,677
THEY WENT ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.

130
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:31,112
IT WAS DISGRACEFUL.

131
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:32,680
I THINK THEY DISGRACE THEIR

132
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:33,481
PARTY AND THEY DISGRACED

133
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:33,881
THEMSELVES.

134
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:36,317
>> Shannon: LET ME ASK YOU.

135
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:37,151
TODAY THE FBI DIRECTOR

136
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:38,719
CHRISTOPHER WRAY WAS TAKING A

137
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,487
LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM SOME OF

138
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:43,124
THOSE DEMOCRATS.

139
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,092
SOME ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY

140
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:46,560
COMMITTEE AND WHO OPPOSED NOW

141
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:47,495
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH.

142
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:48,596
THEY WERE PRESSING THE FBI

143
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:51,532
DIRECTOR ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU

144
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,534
OR OTHERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE

145
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:55,136
TIED HIS HANDS WITH REGARDS THE

146
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:59,073
SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION.

147
00:03:59,074 --> 00:03:59,573
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

148
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:00,474
>> President Trump: WHAT DID

149
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:01,308
HE SAY?

150
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,877
I WAS WORKING ON THE HURRICANE

151
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:03,711
AND OTHER THINGS.

152
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,146
>> Shannon: HE SAID THERE WERE

153
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:06,614
SOME THINGS HE COULDN'T DIVULGE

154
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:07,314
AND THEY WERE CARRIED OUT BY

155
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,916
STANDARD PROCEDURE.

156
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,385
A LOT OF FOLKS WONDERING IF YOU

157
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:13,320
WOULD RELEASE THE FBI SCOPE

158
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:13,721
LETTER.

159
00:04:13,722 --> 00:04:15,423
>> President Trump: I WOULD DO

160
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:16,924
WHATEVER THEY SENATE WANTED.

161
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:19,527
THE SENATE WAS SO WELL RUN BY

162
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:20,027
SENATOR GRASSLEY.

163
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:21,128
WHATEVER THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO

164
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:22,096
IS OKAY WITH ME.

165
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,364
IF THEY WANT TO RELEASE, IT'S

166
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:23,731
OKAY.

167
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,232
IF THEY DON'T WANT TO, I CAN

168
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,101
UNDERSTAND IT ALSO.

169
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:28,669
AGAIN, IT WAS GOING TO BE THEIR

170
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,538
VOTE AND ELECT THEM DO WHATEVER

171
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:31,639
THEY WANTED TO DO.

172
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,874
THAT INCLUDED THE INVESTIGATION

173
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,208
ITSELF.

174
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:35,910
WHAT THEY WANTED AND IF THEY

175
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:36,744
WANTED SOMETHING, THEY WANTED ME

176
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:38,512
TO LET THEM KNOW OR THEY COULD

177
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:39,713
HAVE DIRECTLY LEFT THE FBI KNOW

178
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:43,317
AS FAR AS I WOULD BE CONCERNED.

179
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:45,286
OBVIOUSLY THE REPORTS WERE VERY

180
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:46,253
STRONG BECAUSE EVERYBODY THAT

181
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:50,324
READ THEM CAME AWAY AND SAID

182
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:51,725
EVERYTHING SAID WAS TOTALLY

183
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:53,627
UNCORROBORATED OR NOT TRUE.

184
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,329
I THINK IT WAS A DISGRACE

185
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:55,663
FRANKLY.

186
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:57,998
AND I AM GLAD WE WENT THE EXTRA

187
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:59,500
WEEK BECAUSE BY COMING THE EXTRA

188
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:01,001
WEEK AND GOING THE EXTRA WEEK,

189
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:03,737
WE ENDED UP EXACTLY WITH THAT.

190
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:07,975
SO IT WAS -- IT WAS IN MANY WAYS

191
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:09,477
A VERY SAD.

192
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:11,679
LACK OF TIME FOR THIS COUNTRY TO

193
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,280
HAVE A MAN LIKE THAT GO THROUGH

194
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:14,348
WHAT HE HAD TO GO THROUGH AND

195
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,718
HIS FAMILY AND HIS YOUNG

196
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:18,352
DAUGHTERS TO GO THROUGH A

197
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:23,491
SITUATION LIKE THAT WHERE THEY

198
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:25,226
WERE -- A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK

199
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:26,727
THEY KNOW WHO LEAKED IT.

200
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:28,729
THEY WERE LEAKING THINGS AND

201
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,930
DOING THINGS AND SAYING THINGS

202
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:31,332
THAT WERE INAPPROPRIATE.

203
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,900
I THINK DEMOCRATS DISGRACE

204
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:34,168
THEMSELVES DURING THE HEARINGS.

205
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:35,936
>> Shannon: WHAT DO YOU THINK

206
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:36,504
ABOUT DR. FORD?

207
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:38,606
DO YOU THINK SHE WENT THROUGH A

208
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:39,006
TOUGH TIME?

209
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:40,508
DO YOU THINK SHE WAS ACTING ON

210
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:41,909
HER OWN?

211
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,512
DO YOU THINK SHE WAS ACTING ON

212
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:45,279
POLITICAL OR PARTY PRESSURE?

213
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,046
>> President Trump: I DON'T

214
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:48,149
HAVE AN OPINION ON THAT.

215
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,717
THAT WAS 36 YEARS AGO.

216
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:51,752
THERE WERE NO COMPLAINTS DURING

217
00:05:51,753 --> 00:05:53,554
THIS LONG, LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

218
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:54,588
WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO IT, SHE

219
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:55,990
DIDN'T KNOW HOW SHE GOT THERE OR

220
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:58,159
HOW SHE GOT BACK WHERE THE TIME

221
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,792
OR THE YEAR.

222
00:05:58,793 --> 00:05:59,760
SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE HOUSE.

223
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:01,729
SHE DIDN'T KNOW THAT SECTION,

224
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:07,368
THE AREA.

225
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:08,102
SHE KNEW THAT SHE HAD ONE BEER.

226
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:08,736
SHE SAID SHE HAD ONE BEER.

227
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:11,305
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

228
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:12,907
DO I HAVE A STATEMENT TO MAKE?

229
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:14,608
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY

230
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:16,076
STATEMENT BUT I CAN TELL YOU

231
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:16,377
THIS.

232
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:17,912
I REALLY BELIEVE YOU NEED A LOT

233
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:19,346
MORE THAN THAT TO TAKE SOMEBODY

234
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:22,316
WHO IS A WORLD-CLASS STUDENT,

235
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:23,918
WHO WAS A HARD WORKER, NEVER

236
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,019
HAD A PROBLEM.

237
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,387
THIS WASN'T COVERED BY A FEW

238
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:28,489
TAKE FROM THE TIME HE GRADUATED

239
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,692
FROM COLLEGE TO RIGHT NOW, HE

240
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:35,996
LET A VERY SPECTACULAR, CLEAN

241
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:37,464
LIFE, A BEAUTIFUL LIFE.

242
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:40,100
IF HE DIDN'T, HE WAS A HIGH

243
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:40,868
JUDGE, SECOND HIGHEST COURT, AS

244
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:42,169
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO.

245
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,672
IF HE DIDN'T COME IT WOULD'VE

246
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:45,706
BEEN REPORTED IN THE NEWSPAPERS

247
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:46,607
ALMOST LIKE IT WOULD BE REPORTED

248
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:49,109
IF I DID IT.

249
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,311
>> Shannon: WITH THE MINOR

250
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:51,512
EXCEPTIONS, I WOULD SAY MOST

251
00:06:51,513 --> 00:06:53,814
FOLKS THOUGHT YOU WERE PRETTY

252
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:54,882
RESTRAINED WHEN IT CAME TO

253
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:55,749
DR. FORD COMMENTING ON THE

254
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,286
KAVANAUGH PROCESS, WAS THAT

255
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:00,688
DIFFICULT FOR YOU?

256
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:02,156
IS IT SOMETHING YOU THINK YOU

257
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:02,990
WILL TOO WITH OTHER MAJOR ISSUES

258
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:05,292
AS WELL?

259
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:06,493
>> President Trump: I LIKED

260
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:07,695
THE JOB THE SENATE DID.

261
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:09,663
I THOUGHT THEY WERE DIGNIFIED IN

262
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:12,066
TERMS OF THE REPUBLICANS THAT

263
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:12,333
IS.

264
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:13,400
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THAT

265
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:13,701
TIME.

266
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:15,069
THEY COULD'VE TAKEN A MUCH

267
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,705
EARLIER VOTE, AS YOU KNOW.

268
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:18,472
THEY WAITED.

269
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:19,106
THEY WATCHED.

270
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:21,408
THEY ASKED THE FBI TO DO A

271
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:22,476
SEVENTH INVESTIGATION.

272
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:23,510
DON'T FORGET THAT WAS THE

273
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:26,280
SEVENTH INVESTIGATION, SHANNON.

274
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:28,282
THEY ASKED FOR A SEVENTH

275
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:31,085
INVESTIGATION OBVIOUSLY IT WAS

276
00:07:31,086 --> 00:07:31,485
VERY STRONG.

277
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:32,253
SUSAN COLLINS AND LINDSEY GRAHAM

278
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:34,154
AND EVERYBODY THAT WENT TO READ

279
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:39,260
IT CAME OUT AND SAID WOW.

280
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,728
NUMBER ONE, THEY THOUGHT IT WAS

281
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:42,129
THOROUGH.

282
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,297
NUMBER TWO, THERE WAS NOTHING

283
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:43,697
THERE.

284
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:45,766
I'M GLAD WE TOOK THE EXTRA WEEK

285
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:47,268
AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SAID I

286
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:49,270
WAS RESTRAINED.

287
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:50,871
I THINK THAT'S GOOD.

288
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:52,473
I WAS RESTRAINED ALSO BECAUSE

289
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:53,140
THE SENATE REALLY WAS DOING

290
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:54,742
THEIR JOB, AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED

291
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:55,109
TO.

292
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,943
>> Shannon: LET ME ASK YOU

293
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:58,045
SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S COME UP

294
00:07:58,046 --> 00:07:59,513
TONIGHT.

295
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:02,683
SENATE AND FOREIGN POLICY, THE

296
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:03,217
ISSUE OF THE MISSING

297
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:03,917
"WASHINGTON POST" JOURNALIST,

298
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:09,089
THE SAUDI MAN.

299
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,658
THERE IS CONFLICTING INFORMATION

300
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:11,925
BUT SENATOR CORKER HIMSELF,

301
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:12,893
REPUBLICAN, SAID BASED ON U.S.

302
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:16,096
INTEL THAT HE HAS SEEN, HE SAYS

303
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:16,830
EVERYTHING POINTS TO THE SAUDIS

304
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,265
BEING RESPONSIBLE THAT HE

305
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:19,667
DISAPPEARED OR HE'S BEEN KILLED.

306
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:21,702
THE TURKS SAY THE SAME.

307
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:23,103
THE SAUDIS DENY IT.

308
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:24,705
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO OUR

309
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:28,142
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SAUDIS?

310
00:08:28,143 --> 00:08:29,877
IF YOU BECOME CONVINCED, THE

311
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:32,079
ADMINISTRATION BECOMES CONVINCED

312
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,314
THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS

313
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:35,015
DEATH OR TO PARENTS.

314
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:35,648
>> President Trump: IT'S A

315
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,116
TERRIBLE THING.

316
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,484
I WOULD NOT BE HAPPY AT ALL.

317
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:40,421
I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY SO

318
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:41,789
FAR IT'S LOOKING A LITTLE BIT

319
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,623
LIKE THAT WERE GOING TO HAVE TO

320
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:43,891
SEE.

321
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:44,992
WE ARE DOING A LOT OF WORK ON

322
00:08:44,993 --> 00:08:45,259
IT.

323
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,993
IT WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE A GOOD

324
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:47,628
THING AT ALL.

325
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:50,864
>> Shannon: WHAT ABOUT THE

326
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,366
SENATORS, BIPARTISAN TALK THEY

327
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,068
WOULD BLOCK ANY FURTHER ARMS

328
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:55,669
SALES TO SAUDI.

329
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,870
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT?

330
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:57,571
>> President Trump: THAT WOULD

331
00:08:57,572 --> 00:08:59,373
BE HURTING US.

332
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:02,710
WE HAVE JOBS.

333
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:03,911
WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS

334
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,346
HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY.

335
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:07,314
WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT'S DOING

336
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:08,515
PROBABLY BETTER ECONOMICALLY

337
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:10,284
THAN IT'S EVER DONE BEFORE.

338
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:11,952
PART OF THAT IS WHAT WE ARE

339
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:14,655
DOING WITH OUR DEFENSE SYSTEMS

340
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:15,489
AND EVERYBODY IS WANTING THEM

341
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,692
AND FRANKLY I THINK THAT WOULD

342
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:19,727
BE VERY, VERY TOUGH PILL TO

343
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:22,863
SWALLOW FOR OUR COUNTRY.

344
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:24,164
THEY ARE QUICK TO JUMP THAT WAY.

345
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:27,501
I WOULD HAVE TO FIND OUT REALLY

346
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:29,169
BEFORE I DISCUSS IT, I'D HAVE TO

347
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,471
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WE

348
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:32,039
ARE LOOKING AND SO ARE OTHER

349
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,373
PEOPLE.

350
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:34,141
TURKEY IS LOOKING.

351
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:36,076
A COUPLE OF OTHERS ARE LOOKING.

352
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:39,713
THEY ARE VERY TALENTED PEOPLE

353
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:40,080
INVOLVED.

354
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,148
WE WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.

355
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,752
I DO HATE TO COMMIT TO WHAT

356
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:46,286
RECOURSE WE WOULD TAKE.

357
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:48,088
IT'S TOO EARLY.

358
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:48,822
>> Shannon: HAVE YOU NARROWED

359
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:51,892
YOUR LIST OR MADE A DECISION

360
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:52,526
ABOUT REPLACING AMBASSADOR

361
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:52,926
HALEY?

362
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,695
>> President Trump: FIRST OF

363
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:56,096
ALL, NIKKI WAS FANTASTIC AND THE

364
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:57,731
INCREDIBLE THING IS I REALLY

365
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:58,365
HAVE FIVE OR SIX FANTASTIC

366
00:09:58,366 --> 00:09:58,699
PEOPLE.

367
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,433
I THINK THEY WOULD ALL DO THE

368
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:01,268
JOB REALLY WELL.

369
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,903
THE ANSWER IS YES, I DON'T

370
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:05,272
EXPECT TO BE ADDING ANYBODY TO

371
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:05,639
THE LIST.

372
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,276
WE HAVE SOME REALLY TALENTED,

373
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,678
BRILLIANT PEOPLE THAT WILL DO A

374
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,112
GREAT JOB.

375
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:14,648
PROBABLY OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR

376
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:15,883
TWO, I WILL ANNOUNCE IT -- NIKKI

377
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:18,152
IS GOING TO BE HERE TO THE END

378
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:19,119
OF THE YEAR AND SO ANYBODY WILL

379
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,888
BE WORKING WITH HER FOR A LITTLE

380
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:21,588
PERIOD OF TIME AT LEAST WHICH

381
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:23,857
WILL BE GOOD.

382
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:26,427
BUT IT'S SOMETIME IN THE VERY

383
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:28,896
NEAR FUTURE, I WILL BE

384
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:29,496
ANNOUNCING THE NAME.

385
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:31,498
>> Shannon: YOU CAN COME BACK

386
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:32,966
HERE AT 11:00 ANY TIME.

387
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:33,700
>> President Trump: THE SHOW

388
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:34,201
IS GREAT.

389
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:36,003
I THINK I WILL DO IT.

390
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:36,670
>> Shannon: LET ME ASK YOU

391
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,605
ABOUT A PIECE YOU WROTE GOING

392
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:41,408
AFTER THE MEDICARE FOR ALL IDEA.

393
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:42,176
YOU CALLED THE DEMOCRATS RADICAL

394
00:10:42,177 --> 00:10:42,543
SOCIALIST.

395
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:45,112
YOU SAY THEY WANT TO TURN THE

396
00:10:45,113 --> 00:10:47,281
U.S. INTO VENEZUELA.

397
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:48,115
NOT SURPRISINGLY,

398
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:48,916
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS SAID YOU

399
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,551
ARE LYING ABOUT HIS PROPOSAL AND

400
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,686
HE SAYS THE POLL SHOWED THAT

401
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:54,121
AMERICANS WANT WHAT HE IS

402
00:10:54,122 --> 00:10:55,823
PROPOSING FOR YOUR RESPONSE.

403
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:56,490
>> President Trump: I DON'T

404
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:56,857
THINK SO.

405
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:58,258
IF YOU DO WHAT HE SAYS, YOU'RE

406
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,726
NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY AND

407
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:00,427
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE VENEZUELA

408
00:11:00,428 --> 00:11:02,329
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LIFT

409
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,131
UP YOUR TAXES BY THREE TIMES.

410
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:05,632
WE HAVE BEEN CUTTING TAXES.

411
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:08,469
WE ARE GIVING GREAT HEALTH CARE

412
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,902
PLANS.

413
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:10,704
WE JUST CAME OUT WITH ANOTHER

414
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:12,239
CONCEPT OF A PLAN TODAY THAT A

415
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,274
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LIKING VERY

416
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:14,675
MUCH.

417
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:16,977
WE ARE DOING A REAL JOB.

418
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:19,012
WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL

419
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,714
MANDATE THAT PEOPLE HATED WHICH

420
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:22,216
WAS HORRIBLE.

421
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:23,851
IT WAS THE OBAMA PLAN AND

422
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:24,284
OBAMACARE.

423
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,320
WE ARE ALSO KEEPING THE PREMIUMS

424
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:27,221
DOWN AT A MUCH LOWER LEVEL THAN

425
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:30,757
THEY EVER WERE IN THE OBAMA

426
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,793
ADMINISTRATION.

427
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:33,760
WE HAD IT BEAT OTHER THAN ONE

428
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:34,094
SENATOR.

429
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:37,297
YOU COULD PUT IT DIFFERENTLY.

430
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:38,599
ONE SENATOR LATE IN THE EVENING

431
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,867
HAPPEN TO VOTE AGAINST IT,

432
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,869
SHOCKINGLY EVEN THOUGH HE

433
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,503
CAMPAIGNED FOR EIGHT YEARS

434
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:45,038
AGAINST IT.

435
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,673
WE HAD IT DOWN.

436
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:47,407
IT WAS REPEAL AND REPLACE.

437
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:50,878
WE ARE COMING UP WITH, REALLY

438
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,645
COMING UP WITH ALTERNATIVES THAT

439
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:52,646
ARE JUST AS GOOD AND IN SOME

440
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:55,048
CASES MAY BE EVEN BETTER.

441
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,518
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THE

442
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,954
PREMIUMS DOWN MUCH LOWER THAN

443
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:01,655
THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY DURING THE

444
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:04,258
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

445
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,225
THAT'S REALLY THROUGH GOOD

446
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,294
MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH CARE.

447
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,395
WE HAVE THINGS HAPPENING ON

448
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,731
HEALTH CARE THAT ARE GOING TO BE

449
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:11,465
VERY, VERY EXCITING.

450
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,666
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT BERNIE AND

451
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:16,670
NOBODY EVER SAYS IT, BUT THE

452
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:17,404
COUNTRY IS NOT RICH ENOUGH TO

453
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:19,506
EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING WHAT THEY

454
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:20,841
WANT TO DO AND NUMBER TWO, IF

455
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:23,176
YOU DID WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO,

456
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:25,879
IT WOULD BE LOUSY HEALTH CARE.

457
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,513
REALLY LOUSY HEALTH CARE.

458
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:28,482
I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT VERY

459
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:28,815
WELL.

460
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,617
WE ARE RIGHT ON IT AND A LOT OF

461
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:31,652
PEOPLE ARE SAYING WE ARE RIGHT

462
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:33,687
ON IT AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

463
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:36,657
POLLS, I AM SEEING POLL SHOWING

464
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:39,459
US AS PER THE FIRST PART OF OUR

465
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,627
CONVERSATION, THAT THAT THE

466
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:42,095
SENATE, EVERYONE SAYS WE ARE

467
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:43,497
DOING VERY WELL.

468
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:43,897
THE HOUSE.

469
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:44,731
I THINK WE'RE DOING ALMOST AS

470
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:47,134
WELL WITH REGARD TO THE HOUSE.

471
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:49,102
>> Shannon: WITH THE POLLS

472
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,437
THAT SHOW THE HOUSE SLIPPING

473
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:51,572
AWAY FROM THE REPUBLICANS AND

474
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:53,674
INTO THE HANDS OF THE DEMOCRATS,

475
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,876
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE INACCURATE

476
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:56,610
PURPOSELY?

477
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,145
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE FLAWED?

478
00:12:58,146 --> 00:12:59,813
ARE PEOPLE NOT ANSWERING

479
00:12:59,814 --> 00:13:02,149
QUESTIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE TRUMP

480
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,717
SUPPORTERS AND DON'T TRUST

481
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:04,084
POLLSTERS?

482
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:05,419
>> President Trump: I HAVE HAD

483
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,454
MANY INACCURATE POLLS AND I'VE

484
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,757
HAD SOME -- I FOUND RASMUSSEN TO

485
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:12,192
BE ACCURATE.

486
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:12,893
THE "LOS ANGELES TIMES" WAS A

487
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:16,263
VERY ACCURATE POLL.

488
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:17,497
BUSINESS INVESTORS DAILY.

489
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:18,332
WE HAVE SOME POLLS THAT WERE

490
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,767
VERY ACCURATE HAVING TO DO WITH

491
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:21,501
2016.

492
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:22,369
BUT WE HAD SOME POLLS THAT WERE

493
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,505
SO FAR OUT AND WE KNEW THEY WERE

494
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:26,006
PHONY POLLS.

495
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:27,541
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

496
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:29,476
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THAT.

497
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:32,846
I THINK POLLS, THEY CALL IT A

498
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,247
GENERIC POLL AND ACTUALLY THE

499
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,282
REPUBLICANS ARE DOING WELL IN

500
00:13:35,283 --> 00:13:36,750
THE GENERIC POLL BUT I DON'T

501
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:39,252
KNOW THAT A GENERIC POLL MEANS

502
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:41,388
ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY ARE

503
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:42,255
INDIVIDUAL RACES, THE HOUSE.

504
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,256
MANY INDIVIDUAL RACES.

505
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:44,691
I THINK WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL.

506
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:45,792
WE'RE LOOKING AT RACES THAT WE

507
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:47,461
DIDN'T THINK WE WERE GOING TO BE

508
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:49,262
WINNING AND NOW WE ARE EVEN AND

509
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:49,896
UP.

510
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,398
HONESTLY WE ARE NOT GOING TO

511
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,299
KNOW UNTIL NOVEMBER 6.

512
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,501
WE ARE REALLY NOT GOING TO KNOW.

513
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:55,902
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

514
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,104
WHATEVER IT IS.

515
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:59,339
I AM OUT THERE WORKING HARD,

516
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,874
DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

517
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,109
FOR HOUSE MEMBERS AS WELL AS FOR

518
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,442
SENATE.

519
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,478
THEY ALL WANT ME OUT THERE AND

520
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,245
WE ARE GETTING TREMENDOUS CROWDS

521
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:06,847
AND WERE GETTING THE WORD OUT.

522
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:07,514
WE ARE GETTING THE WORD OUT.

523
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:12,085
>> Shannon: WANT TO ASK YOU

524
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:12,819
ANOTHER HEALTH CARE QUESTIONS.

525
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,055
CRITICS SAY YOU'RE STRIPPING

526
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:16,289
AWAY PRE-EXISTING HEALTH CARE

527
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,457
COVERAGE IN THESE PLANS.

528
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,993
THEY SAY THAT THE PLANS ARE

529
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:22,295
CHEAPER BECAUSE THEY OFFER LESS.

530
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,297
WILL YOU COMMIT TO COVERING

531
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:25,032
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS?

532
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:25,766
>> President Trump: I HAVE FOR

533
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:26,099
MONTHS.

534
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,635
IF YOU LISTEN TO MY SPEECHES,

535
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:31,638
I'M SAYING PRE-EXISTING

536
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,806
CONDITIONS COVERED 100% AND

537
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:34,708
REPUBLICANS ARE DOING THAT.

538
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,044
THERE WAS A TIME WHERE THERE

539
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:38,445
WASN'T BEING DONE.

540
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:39,946
THERE WAS A TIME FOR MANY YEARS

541
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:42,015
WHERE IT WASN'T DONE AT ALL AND

542
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:44,851
NOT EVEN THOUGHT OF.

543
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:46,853
WERE 100% PER PRE-EXISTING

544
00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:48,555
UNCOVERING PEOPLE WITH

545
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:49,489
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND

546
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,358
IF YOU LOOK AT MY LAST, FOR MANY

547
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:55,262
MONTHS, SPEECHES, I COVER -- I

548
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:57,097
SAY WE WILL COVER PRE-EXISTING

549
00:14:57,098 --> 00:14:57,497
CONDITIONS.

550
00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:58,432
THE DIFFERENCE IS DEMOCRATS

551
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,267
WON'T BE ABLE TO DO IT BECAUSE

552
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:02,469
IT DOESN'T FIT IN THEIR PLANS

553
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,870
AND IT DOESN'T WORK MONETARILY.

554
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:06,239
THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO

555
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,506
IT.

556
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:07,841
>> Shannon: TOMORROW YOU HAVE

557
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:09,710
A SPECIAL GUEST FOR LUNCH,

558
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:10,577
KANYE WEST IS COMING TO THE

559
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:11,078
WHITE HOUSE.

560
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:12,579
HOW DOES THIS WORK?

561
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,848
DOES HE TELL YOU WHAT HE WANTS

562
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:15,515
FOR LUNCH?

563
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:20,153
DO YOU PICK?

564
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:20,854
>> President Trump: THAT WAS

565
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:21,655
NEVER DISCUSSED.

566
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:22,823
JIM BROWN, MAYBE THE GREATEST

567
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:25,258
RUNNING BACK EVER.

568
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,860
HE WAS A GREAT LACROSSE PLAYER.

569
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:28,962
SOME PEOPLE SAY HE WAS A BETTER

570
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:29,429
LACROSSE PLAYER.

571
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,265
HE'S A GREAT ATHLETE.

572
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,201
JIM BROWN IS COMING.

573
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:36,002
JIM HAS BEEN A SUPPORTER FROM

574
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,003
THE BEGINNING OF ME.

575
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,171
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

576
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:39,272
UNEMPLOYMENT, IT'S THE BEST IN

577
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,209
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY,

578
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,845
BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT THE

579
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:46,346
LOWEST LEVEL EVER IN HISTORY.

580
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:50,650
YOU LOOK AT MEDIAN INCOME FOR

581
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:51,151
AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

582
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:52,786
IT'S AT THE BEST EVER BEEN IN

583
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:54,221
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

584
00:15:54,222 --> 00:15:59,192
I AM DOING THINGS FOR THE

585
00:15:59,193 --> 00:15:59,893
AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT HAVE

586
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:01,828
NEVER BEEN DONE BY THE DEMOCRATS

587
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:03,663
AND AS YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS

588
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,665
REALLY HAVE HAD THAT VOTE.

589
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,334
THEY'VE HAD THAT VOTE LOCKED UP.

590
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:11,171
IT'S NOT SO LOCKED UP ANYMORE.

591
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:12,139
I AM PRODUCING NUMBERS THAT THEY

592
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,675
WERE NEVER ABLE TO PRODUCE.

593
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:17,077
IT'S A GREAT THING.

594
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:18,378
KANYE WEST SAW THAT.

595
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:19,446
KANYE IS A SMART GUY.

596
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:20,680
HE SAW THAT.

597
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:21,281
JIM BROWN SOUGHT.

598
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:25,485
I COULD NAME MANY OTHER GREAT

599
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:28,388
BLACK STARS AND ATHLETES THAT

600
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:29,456
ARE ON OUR SIDE.

601
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:30,257
YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE A NEW

602
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:32,058
REPORT ABOUT THEM.

603
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:33,994
WE HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT, A

604
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:34,728
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT AND

605
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:35,729
IT'S GAINING ALL THE TIME

606
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,164
BECAUSE I'M PRODUCING.

607
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:39,032
WHEN YOU LOOK AT NUMBERS LIKE

608
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:39,766
THAT, WHEN IT'S THE BEST IN THE

609
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:44,271
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, HOW CAN

610
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:46,206
SOME OF?

611
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:47,674
>> Shannon: HOW LONG DOES THE

612
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:50,177
ATTORNEY GENERAL STICK AROUND,

613
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:51,244
MR. PRESIDENT  ?

614
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:51,945
>> President Trump: WELL,

615
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:52,879
WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

616
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,080
LET'S ALL SEE.

617
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,082
THE NICE PART IS THAT WE ARE,

618
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:56,783
EVERYBODY'S WORKING TOGETHER.

619
00:16:56,784 --> 00:17:00,253
I HAVE A GREAT, I REALLY HAVE A

620
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:01,454
GREAT CABINET.

621
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:02,656
EVERYBODY IS WORKING HARD.

622
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:04,357
THEY ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER.

623
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,159
AS YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE, THINGS

624
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,828
ARE GOING VERY WELL.

625
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,163
WE FINISHED A BIG DEAL WITH

626
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:11,264
CANADA, MEXICO.

627
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:13,533
WE FINISHED THE DEAL WITH

628
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:13,934
SOUTH KOREA.

629
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:14,901
WE ARE WINNING WITH CHINA.

630
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:17,237
CHINA WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL

631
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:17,838
BADLY.

632
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,639
WE ARE WINNING WITH CHINA.

633
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,707
WE ARE WINNING AT EVERY FRONT

634
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,576
AND THAT'S THE WAY WANT TO KEEP

635
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:23,276
IT.

636
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:25,145
WE ARE DOING VERY WELL.

637
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:25,912
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE

638
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:26,413
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

639
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:28,148
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH

640
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,850
SOME OTHER POSITIONS BUT I WILL

641
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:30,851
SAY WE HAVE A GREAT CABINET.

642
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:31,818
I THINK WE HAVE ONE OF THE BEST

643
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,454
CABINETS EVER.

644
00:17:34,455 --> 00:17:35,889
>> Shannon: HOW WOULD YOU

645
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,756
RATE, I'M GETTING TO GIVE YOU

646
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:38,258
THREE SENATORS.

647
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:41,461
WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE?

648
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:43,063
MITCH MCCONNELL, CHUCK GRASSLEY,

649
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:43,663
LINDSEY GRAHAM?

650
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:44,331
>> President Trump: ALL OF

651
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:44,631
THEM.

652
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:45,465
I LIKE THEM ALL.

653
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:47,634
DON'T GET ME INTO THAT.

654
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:52,138
IT COULD GET ME INTO A LOT OF

655
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:52,472
TROUBLE.

656
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:56,877
CHUCK GRASSLEY IS A STRONG GUY,

657
00:17:56,878 --> 00:17:57,844
GRUFF.

658
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:58,612
I SAY THAT IN AN AFFECTIONATE

659
00:17:58,613 --> 00:17:58,879
WAY.

660
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,116
HE DID A FANTASTIC JOB.

661
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:04,317
THAT WAS NOT EASY AND THEN THEY

662
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:05,819
SEND THE PHONE HE PAID

663
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,254
PROTESTERS AND SCREAMING ALL THE

664
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:08,054
TIME.

665
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:10,090
FRANKLY, THEY LET THEM SCREEN

666
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:10,690
BECAUSE THEY DISCREDITED

667
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:12,092
THEMSELVES AND THEY WERE ALL PUT

668
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:14,227
UP BY THE DEMOCRATS.

669
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:15,829
THE DEMOCRATS ADMITTED THAT THEY

670
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,463
WORKED WITH THESE PEOPLE.

671
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:19,432
IT'S TERRIBLE.

672
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,268
CHUCK GRASSLEY DID A GREAT JOB.

673
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:23,236
AS YOU KNOW, LINDSAY WAS

674
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:23,637
OUTSTANDING.

675
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:25,071
I MEAN, LINDSAY WAS JUST

676
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:28,541
ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING.

677
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,076
HIS LEVEL -- COULDN'T BELIEVE

678
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:31,077
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

679
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:34,881
IT WAS SO NASTY AND SO FALSE AND

680
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:36,950
SO, SUCH FABRICATED STORIES AND

681
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:37,250
LIES.

682
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:38,818
LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS INCREDIBLE.

683
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,620
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT.

684
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:44,491
I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF MITCH FOR A

685
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:46,826
LONG TIME.

686
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:49,062
WE HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP

687
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:50,830
WHICH AGAIN A LOT OF PEOPLE

688
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:51,865
DON'T KNOW THAT.

689
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:52,933
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS

690
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:56,236
TOGETHER AND MITCH WAS FANTASTI

691
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:56,603
FANTASTIC.

692
00:18:56,604 --> 00:18:58,171
REALLY ALL THREE WERE STARS.

693
00:18:58,172 --> 00:18:59,306
>> Shannon: ONE LAST QUESTION

694
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:01,474
TO YOU BEFORE WE GO.

695
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:04,144
THE DOW, A LOT OF FOLKS

696
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:04,511
CONCERNED.

697
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:05,879
I KNOW YOU'VE HAD SOME THEORIES.

698
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,980
SOME CRITICS SAY IT'S IN PART

699
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:09,015
BECAUSE OF THE TRADE WAR WITH

700
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:09,349
CHINA.

701
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,451
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

702
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:12,118
>> President Trump: I DON'T

703
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,521
THINK THAT'S IT AT ALL.

704
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:15,889
THE TRADE WAR WITH CHINA.

705
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,024
WE ARE TAKING IN BILLIONS

706
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,759
OF DOLLARS FROM TARIFFS FROM

707
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,828
CHINESE GOODS AND IT HASN'T HURT

708
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:22,095
US.

709
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:23,496
WE ARE TAKING IN BILLIONS AND

710
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:24,064
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

711
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:25,332
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE PRODUCTS

712
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,467
HERE THAT WE ARE BUYING IN

713
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:27,834
CHINA.

714
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,369
THAT WASN'T AT.

715
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,571
THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS WITH THE

716
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:32,238
FED.

717
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,239
THE FED IS GOING WILD.

718
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,841
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR

719
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,276
PROBLEM IS THAT THEY ARE RAISING

720
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:38,278
INTEREST RATES AND IT'S

721
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,247
RIDICULOUS.

722
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:43,249
I DON'T CALL THEM TRADE WARS.

723
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,118
I SAY WE ARE DOING A LITTLE BIT

724
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,153
OF BATTLE, NOT MUCH BUT CHINA,

725
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:50,290
YOU KNOW, WE PUT $250 BILLION

726
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,858
WITH OF TARIFFS AND POTENTIAL

727
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,294
TARIFFS AT 25%.

728
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:57,063
WE HAVE 267 BILLION MORE IF I

729
00:19:57,064 --> 00:19:57,664
WANT TO DO IT.

730
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:59,799
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL.

731
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,302
HEY, YOU SAID AND WE ALL SAID

732
00:20:02,303 --> 00:20:03,737
OH, CANADA WILL NEVER MAKE A

733
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:04,037
DEAL.

734
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:05,905
CANADA MADE A DRILL THAT'S A

735
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:06,473
GREAT DEAL.

736
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:07,941
WE OPENED UP CANADA FOR OUR

737
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:08,908
FARMERS.

738
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:09,642
YOU LOOK AT MEXICO BARELY MADE

739
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:10,510
THE DEAL.

740
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:12,479
LOOK AT THE HORRIBLE DEAL WITH

741
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,913
WE HAD WITH SOUTH KOREA.

742
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:14,647
THAT WAS THROWN OUT AND

743
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:17,217
RENEGOTIATED AND NOW IT'S A GOOD

744
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:17,851
DEAL.

745
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:19,652
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.

746
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,221
THE PROBLEM IN MY OPINION IS

747
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:23,757
TREASURY AND THE FED.

748
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:34,200
THE FED IS GOING LOCO AND

749
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:34,934
THERE'S NO REASON FOR THEM TO DO

750
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:35,568
IT I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.

751
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:36,236
>> Shannon: ON THE ISSUE OF

752
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:36,970
CIVILITY TODAY WE HEARD FROM THE

753
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:37,637
FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC

754
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:38,371
HOLDER SAYING INCENTIVE WE GO

755
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:38,838
LOW, WE GO HIGH.

756
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:42,242
HE SAID WHEN WE GO    --

757
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:43,476
HILLARY CLINTON SAID WE DON'T

758
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:44,778
RETURN TO CIVILITY BECAUSE POWER

759
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:46,813
IS THE ONLY THING REPUBLICANS

760
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:49,115
UNDERSTAND.

761
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:52,752
WHEN YOU PRESS PEOPLE ON THAT,

762
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,054
THEY WILL SAY YOU STARTED THIS

763
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:55,188
BY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO ROUGH

764
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:58,558
UP PROTESTERS AND BY GOING AFTER

765
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,659
PEOPLE WITH NICKNAMES AND ALL

766
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,428
KINDS OF THINGS.

767
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:02,595
HOW DO YOU RESPOND?

768
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,230
>> President Trump: I DON'T

769
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:04,764
THINK SO.

770
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:05,432
MY RALLIES HAVE BEEN VERY

771
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:06,633
PEACEFUL AND EVEN AT THE

772
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:08,435
BEGINNING WHEN THERE SEEMED TO

773
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:10,537
BE CONFLICT, THEY SENT PAID

774
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:12,439
PEOPLE TO DISRUPT OUR RALLIES.

775
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,474
WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU KNOW, BAD

776
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:15,041
THINGS HAPPEN.

777
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,178
THEY WERE THE ONES THAT STARTED

778
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:18,878
EVERYTHING.

779
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:19,779
NO, IT WASN'T US.

780
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,115
IT WAS TOTALLY THE OTHER SIDE.

781
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:25,051
I WOULD HAVE A RALLY AND PAID

782
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:26,920
PEOPLE WERE GOING INTO THOSE

783
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:27,854
RALLIES CAUSING TROUBLE.

784
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:29,622
IN MANY CASES, IT DIDN'T WORK

785
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,758
OUT SO WELL FOR THOSE PEOPLE.

786
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,827
>> Shannon: BUT NOT OKAY TO

787
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:35,061
PUNCH THEM.

788
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:35,862
>> President Trump: SHANNON,

789
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:37,130
PAID PEOPLE WERE IN THOSE

790
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:37,530
RALLIES.

791
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:39,499
WHEN I HEAR HOLDER MAKING A

792
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,668
STATEMENT LIKE HE DID TODAY,

793
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:43,136
IT'S A DISGRACE.

794
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:44,070
HILLARY, I REALLY UNDERSTAND.

795
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:45,638
SHE JUST DOESN'T GET IT.

796
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:46,239
SHE NEVER DID.

797
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,006
SHE NEVER WILL AND THAT'S WHY

798
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:49,142
SHE LOST THE ELECTION.

799
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:50,443
>> Shannon: I THINK WE ALL

800
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:53,012
HOPE WE CAN GET BACK TO SOME

801
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:54,614
FORM OF CIVILITY OR WE CAN HAVE

802
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:55,348
DISAGREEMENTS AND RESPECT EACH

803
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:56,749
OTHER IN THE PROCESS.

804
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,620
>> President Trump: I HOPE SO

805
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:01,421
TOO.

806
00:22:01,422 --> 00:22:02,222
I DO.

807
00:22:02,223 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Shannon: MR. PRESIDENT, WE
