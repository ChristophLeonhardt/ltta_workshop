on foreign affairs also and this is right before will bring in the god-king to pour cold water on everything we're getting the World Cup in North America it's gonna be this nice alliance between Canada the United States Mexico a Donald Trump by the way has been lobbying since March to bring the World Cup to North America meanwhile Los Angeles is getting the 2028 Summer Olympics as well so we've got two major international sporting events that are coming to the United States because of Donald Trump everybody predicted that Trump would hurt these bids because the whole world hates him right he's you know he's humiliating on the or allies hate us and instead he actually helped now look I do not care very much for the Olympics I don't watch the Olympics other than curling curling is one of my favorite sports in the world but other than curling I don't like it I also think that soccer basically should be outlawed in the United States but it is a very good sign nonetheless of this global leadership the United States has global leadership president Trump has picked up two major international sporting events that's a good thing so say I now I think the god-king the the founder of my feasts and the man who signs my checks disagrees with me on this can we bring on the god-king look it's Donald Trump's birthday it's Flag Day I'm feeling so good tell me bring me down what's interesting to me is how everyone who supports the president uh-huh carries water for the president you can't just be a general fan of the guy you have to be basically an evangelist you're Donald proselytizing FF and so when he says for example he calls kim jonghwan Rocketman all Biz things like yes we have always wanted war on the Korean Peninsula and when he says things like I really trust in there it's like yes we have always wanted peace on the Korean Peninsula no one ever knows what they stand with you people and this is the greatest example this is a microcosm yeah of all things Trump that one of the great arguments on behalf of Donald Trump is he's going to be a global leader he's going to rebuild America's supremacy he's going to salvage Western civilization America great and make America great again he's gonna salvage Western civilization and now you're crowing that he is bringing this bastard sport of soccer to the United States this is Obama level leading from behind you call that global leadership global leadership is called baseball yes that's baseball believable maybe for global leading from behind yeah it's called soccer I have to say when I was reading all the good news today well we'll get to the we'll get to the great explanation because I have to say this is the best never Trump argument
