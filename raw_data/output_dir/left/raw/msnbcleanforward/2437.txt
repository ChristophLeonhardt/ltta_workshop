RECOMMENDATION. BUT IT IS REALLY INTERESTING

99
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,274
BUT IT IS REALLY INTERESTING THAT HE DOESN’T SEEM TO BE

ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT GROUPS. HE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF

128
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:11,916
HE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION CASES.

129
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,484
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION CASES. A QUESTION WAS RAISED ABOUT HIM

130
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:15,687
A QUESTION WAS RAISED ABOUT HIM ORIGINALLY, AND HE WASN’T ON THE

00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:19,991
CHALLENGE TO OBAMACARE, AND HE DIDN’T VOTE TO STRIKE IT DOWN.

135
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:21,126
DIDN’T VOTE TO STRIKE IT DOWN. HE VOTED FOR THE PROPOSITION

HE VOTED FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT THE COURTS CAN’T GET

137
