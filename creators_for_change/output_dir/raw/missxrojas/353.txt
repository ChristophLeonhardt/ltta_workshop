<font color="#CCCCCC">felt like that was an attacking it's</font>

18
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,449
what I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do as I broke up</font>

19
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,850
that umbrella term into sizable chunks

20
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,800
and talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about specific projects and</font>

21
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,750
specific targets I realize if that's

22
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,579
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> angle that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be taking</font>

23
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,410
I'm offer me that umbrella term still is

24
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">very important for me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just a good</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dry and full spread good focus for me it</font>

26
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,469
also is helping now to break things up

27
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,300
into more specific targets and that is

28
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,289
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they really</font>

29
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,820
achieved at the social<font color="#E5E5E5"> media to never</font>

all women all with a very strong

understanding of social media<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there</font>

36
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,520
was a young<font color="#CCCCCC"> woman from Ethiopia was 17</font>

37
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,019
years old and who had been working on

38
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,970
peer to peer education in terms of sex

39
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,159
education<font color="#E5E5E5"> in her towns and spreading it</font>

40
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">around the cities as well and the</font>

41
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,100
Ethiopian government have actually been

42
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,150
quite responsive with that because

43
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've raised their legal age for</font>

44

marriage 289 that doesn't completely or

45
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,659
in any way stop the charges that go on

46
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,340
anyway but it is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those specific</font>

47
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,900
steps in the right direction it was just

48
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting hearing all this information</font>

49
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,080
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing lots of very specific case</font>

50
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,090
studies that really make you understand

51
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,680
what goes into the structure it's not a

52
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,720
perfect structure it's not a structure

53
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,340
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> funny comprehend but i do think</font>

54
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,049
of thinking in terms of structure is

55
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,850
very helpful as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you don't</font>

56
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,710
oversimplify it so what once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,750
this problem of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to big like</font>

58
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,520
empowerment and there's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> too small</font>

59
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,409
like really over simplified situations

60
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were talking a lot about</font>

61
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,560
education and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was reminded a lot of</font>

62
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,329
the big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i heard when I was growing</font>

up being someone who had Tony Blair's

big broad term always like empowerment

67
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,840
and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say we need to bring</font>

68
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,210
education to these regions it's really

69
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,100
difficult to understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> until you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

70
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,420
those case studies you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

71
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,070
anecdotes one of the Ethiopian woman

72
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,020
there was telling us how a girl in her

73
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,030
class I'm guessing they were 13 or 14

74
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,860
when they had blood on their clothes and

75
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,600
she and her friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> are telling her hey</font>

76
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,040
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk to your</font>

79
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:18,209
you start your period you go home and

talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your mother about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and she'll</font>

81
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,760
explain everything to you there's go on

82
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,319
home to her mother who immediately just

83
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,300
flew off the handle and said who have

84
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,860
you been<font color="#CCCCCC"> having sex with his sleeping</font>

85
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,750

any sort of sex education<font color="#E5E5E5"> which I don't</font>

90

91
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,400
anyway she seemed you only started

92
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,290
getting periods after sex equally there

93
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,850
was video footage of girl you had sex

young girl it's so easy and very

100
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,000
understandable that we fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> back onto</font>

101
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,920
this well maybe we're bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some</font>

sex education<font color="#E5E5E5"> or certain attitudes to</font>

105

the highest teenage pregnancy rates in

<font color="#CCCCCC">that means that they are not judged by</font>

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,970
take for granted the fact that we have

extremely good health care but people

133
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,390
say that I've wording is that are most

134
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,239
able to deliver babies at 16 or 17 or

135
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,100
temperatures in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this country we assume</font>

136
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's the same everywhere and</font>

137
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,459
that's some sort of innate natural thing

138
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,870
but in countries that don't have that

139
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,280
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of health care it should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

140
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,830
at least

141
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,390
years old further things like

142
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,950
contraception and family planning in

143
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,540
general allow for breaks between

144
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,850
pregnancies which decreases the risk of

145
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,860
child mortality also lowers the risk of

146
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,390
people dying in childbirth and these are

147
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,160
children dying in childbirth as well I

148
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,930
mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the saddest thing it's 12</font>

149
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,480
and 13 and 14 more girls who are dying

150
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,090
from these really fixable things they

151
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of specific care and a</font>

152
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,630
little focus I'm really that this event

153
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">is happening tomorrow so many levels</font>

154
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,450
there's so many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we</font>

155
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,430
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and we cannot pretend that it</font>

156
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,130
is or just one easy words like

157
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,050
empowerment which isn't an easy word and

158
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,520
we know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> complicated but for other</font>

159
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,200
people they see that word and think they

160
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,060
can brush it away but once you break it

161
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,710
down to their me say empowerment

162
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,180
involves this and that and the other

163
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,400
stage it shows what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge project it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

165
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,120
that you can start taking action because

166
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,100

167
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,330
dismissing things oh that's too big I
