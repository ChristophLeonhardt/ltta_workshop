WE HEARD A LOT OF
PROPAGANDA ABOUT THE TAX CUTS
THAT DONALD TRUMP PUSH THROUGH
WILL LEAD TO BONUSES ON TOP OF
BONUSES FOR AMERICAN WORKERS.
AT&T AND WALMART AND BANK OF
AMERICA, THEY ARE ALL GIVING
BONUSES.
I LIKE THAT REUTERS FOLLOWED UP
ON THE STORY AND DID A POLL TO
SEE IF IT FOUND OUT THAT IF IT
AFFECTED A LARGE AMOUNT OF
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
IT HAS GONE A TON OF PRESS AND
TRUMP HAS DONE A LOT OF CREDIT
FOR IT.
YOU CAN'T FAKE IT IF PEOPLE HAVE
A POSITIVE OUTCOME IN THEIR
LIFE.
THAT MY MAKE THEM MORE LIKELY
TO VOTE FOR HIM.
EVEN IF IT IS A SUGAR HIGH,
LET'S FIND OUT.
A WHOPPING 2%.
NOT FOR 90% OF YOU THE BONUSES
ARE NOT COMING.
IS IT POPULAR OVERALL?
ANOTHER
STORY IN THE NEWS TODAY, TRUMP
IS APPARENTLY JUBILANT.
HE
THINKS HE HAS CRUSHED
EVERYTHING.
WE KNOW WHAT HIS POPULARITY IS,
IT IS IN THE 30S AND LITERALLY
THE WORST OF ANY PRESIDENT AT
THIS POINT IN THEIR FIRST TERM.
BUT TRUMP LIVES ON A DIFFERENT
PLANET AND SO DO HIS SUPPORTERS.
SO WHERE ARE WE?
THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.
IT DIDN'T WORK.
IN THE OLD DAYS YOU JUST PUT IT
ON TV AND BRAINWASH PEOPLE.
NOWADAYS YOU HAVE THIS THING
CALLED A COMPUTER, A PHONE,
AND YOU CAN GET NEWS ON
THE INTERNET.
IF YOU LOOK AROUND A LITTLE BIT
YOU WILL ACTUALLY FIND THE
TRUTH.
IN THE YEAR 2027, THE TOP 1%
OF THIS COUNTRY WILL GET 83%
OF THE BENEFITS OF THE TAX PLAN.
AND YOU CAN SEE IT WITH YOUR OWN
EYES, THEY CUT CORPORATE TAXES
FOR MANY.
IT'S A MASSIVE TRANSFER OF
WEALTH TO MULTINATIONAL
CORPORATIONS
AND THE VERY WEALTHY.
NO MATTER
HOW MUCH PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON
AND NEW YORK ARE ECSTATIC ABOUT
THEIR STOCK AND HOW THE MARKET
IS DOING BECAUSE THEY ARE RICH
AND GETTING RICHER BY THE DAY,
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS NOT
FEELING IT AND YOU HAVE NOT
CHECKED TO THEM.
AT SOME POINT REALITY HAS A WAY
OF CATCHING UP WITH YOU AND WE
WILL FIND OUT IF THAT IS 2018.
RIGHT NOW THE NUMBERS ARE WAY
WORSE FOR REPUBLICANS THAN I
THINK THEY REALIZE OR ANYONE
ON 
TV REALIZES.
