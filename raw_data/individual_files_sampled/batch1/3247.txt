and so how do you build the culture without suddenly sounding like it's just all these corporate bromides that you see on the wall and every corporation that nobody reads and they're meaningless how do you actually build a culture that everyone is proud of makes decisions based on and so forth yeah so we actually rolled out our core values in 2005 so about five or six years and Intuit and we didn't always have core values and it was actually one of those things that a lot of us resisted even myself personally because for exactly that reason it felt like one of those big corporate things to do that no one paid attention to but then we decided to approach it differently because we wanted to come up with committable core values and you know a lot of companies have they might call them core values or guiding principles or so on but the problem is usually they're very lofty sounding they kind of read like a press release that the marketing department put out and maybe you learn about it on day one in orientation but then it's that meaningless plaque on the lobby wall that you're talking about in for us by committable we meant that we wanted to hire and fire people based on whether they're living up to those values completely independent of their actual job performance so even if they're doing their specific job probably fine even if they're a superstar if they're not living up to those core values then we will fire them just for that reason and we didn't just have a few senior executives go to some off-site long weekend and come up with something but instead I sent an email out to the entire company asking everyone which our core values be got a whole bunch of different responses back and went back and forth for about a year and then eventually came up with our list of ten core values and so what are some of them some of them are create fun in a little weirdness for example when we first rolled it out people either loved it or they hated it and so one of our interview questions specially on the scale one to ten how weird are you and if you're one you're probably a little bit too straight-laced for the Zappos culture if you're ten you might be too psychotic for us but it's actually not so much the number we care about it's more how people answer them because our belief is that everyone's a little weird somehow and this is really more just a funny way saying we really recognize and celebrate each person's individuality and we want their true personality shine in the workplace because what we've done is that's when when people can be themselves that's when the real friendships form not just co-worker relationships and that's when the creative ideas come out and that's when employees are most productive another core value be Adventures creative and open-minded one of our interview questions for that is on a scale of one to ten how lucky are you in life one is I don't know why bad things always seem to happen to me ten is I don't know why good things always seem to happen to me and this was actually inspired by a research study I'd read about where they actually asked that exact same question and then they got answers all of the board from new random participants and then afterwards they had them do a task and the task was to go through a newspaper and count the number of photos that were in that newspaper but what they didn't know was that it was actually a fake newspaper and sprinkled throughout the newspaper board headlines that would say things like if you're reading this now you can stop the answers say thirty-seven and collect an extra hundred dollars and they found that the people that consider themselves unlucky in life generally you know they went through the task at hand but basically never knows the headlines and the people that consider themselves lucky life generally stopped early and made the extra hundred dollars so the takeaway being that it's not so much that people are inherently lucky or unlucky in life but luck is really more about being open to opportunity beyond just how the task or situation presents itself so that's why we asked that question for that core value you've built this incredible culture at the company you've maintained it as you go through Amazon it's actually not just maintaining it a lot of companies as they grow bigger the culture goes downhill and not only do we want to prevent that from happening but the real key to our future is we actually want culture to scale and get stronger and stronger not just maintain and so the only way that can happen is if everything you've use as part of his or her job description the responsibility to contribute to our culture and make it stronger and stronger it's not something I can do as an individual because as we get bigger and bigger and the smaller and smaller percentage of the total employee population
