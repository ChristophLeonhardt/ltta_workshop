00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,540
On the second day of his presidency, Barack
Obama signed an executive order to close the

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,279
U.S. Detention Facility in Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba. But efforts to close the facility and

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,490
move terror suspects to prisons on US soil
have since been hampered by Republican opposition.

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,280
When Obama announced that he was still determined
to shut down the facility in February 2016,

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,650
concern over where Guantanamo prisoners would
be relocated to, arose once again. So we wanted

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,730
to know what happens to prisoners after they
leave Guantanamo?

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,160
Well, since Guantanamo Bay Prison opened on
January 11, 2002, it has detained roughly

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,770
780 prisoners, predominantly from the Middle
East. The prison is home to enemy combatants

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,649
captured by the US during the War on Terror,
including the suspected architect of the September

10
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:53,770
11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
As of January 2016, 91 detainees remain. About

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,100
half are still facing criminal charges, 35
have been approved for transfer out of the

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,350
prison, and ten are considered “unreleasable”.
According to the White House, these ten either

13
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,640
cannot yet be transferred to other countries
or they pose a continuing significant threat.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,380
If Guantanamo were to close, some could potentially
be transferred to U.S. soil as per President

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,810
Obama’s most recent plan. This includes
13 potential supermax prisons and military

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,049
sites in states like South Carolina, Kansas
and Colorado. Some republican leaders have

17
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,400
suggested that Obama’s plan could threaten
the security of the United States.

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,740
So where have prisoner's been relocated to
in the past? There are reportedly 57 countries

19
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,250
to which detainees have been sent, with the
majority going to Afghanistan. Many are returned

20
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,970
to their home countries. Seven detainees were
repatriated to Russia, where Human Rights

21
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:48,200
Watch alleged they were tortured, beaten,
harassed, and given unfair trials. Others

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,470
have gone to countries like Canada, Sweden,
El Salvador, and two detainees were sent to

23
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,040
the United States to stand trial in US court.
Some detainees are transferred to terrorist

24
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,119
rehabilitation centers, in countries like
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, featuring psychological

25
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,430
evaluation, medical care, exercise, and religious
counseling. These rehab centers are designed

26
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,760
to convert former jihadi terrorists, by using
Islamic teachings to abolish their extremist

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,150
ideologies.. Saudi officials claim that their
center has an 80% success rate for reforming

28
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,099
prisoners. However, of those prisoners who
were deported and not jailed, upon release,

29
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,749
it’s estimated that about one in six has
returned to terrorism.

30
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:29,900
President Obama said in his 2015 State of
the Union address that it costs $3 million

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,090
dollars a year, per prisoner to be held at
Guantanamo. Aside from the cost, the detention

32
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,819
center has also been the focus of worldwide
attention following years of allegedly inhumane

33
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:44,849
living conditions, government sanctioned torture,
and a lack of legal standing for the prisoners.

34
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,540
With less than 100 detainees remaining, Obama
may actually accomplish his goal of shutting

35
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,809
down the facility by the end of his term.
But when the options on the outside are rehabilitation,

36
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:59,139
imprisonment, death, or recidivism, it is
hard to say whether that’s truly a better

37
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:00,779
option than keeping it open.

38
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:04,870
The past decade and a half of war has contributed
to some of the worst human rights violations

39
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,150
in recent years, with the United States committing
its share of atrocities as well. Government

40
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,449
sanctioned torture has been a hot button issue,
and the CIA’s release of the Torture Report

41
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:19,480
has outlined the extent of the US’s involvement.
