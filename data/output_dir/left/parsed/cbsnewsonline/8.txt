THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO 
TAKING APPROPRIATE ACTIONS NOW, 
GIVEN THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY 
AVAILABLE TO THE UNITED STATES. 
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AT LEAST 
SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS 
RESPONSIBLE, INCLUDING THOSE IN 
THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, THE 
ROYAL COURT, FOREIGN MINISTRY, 
AND OTHER SAUDI MINISTRIES WHO 
WE SUSPECT TO HAVE BEEN 
INVOLVED IN MR. KHASHOGGI'S 
DEATH. 
WE ARE TAKING APPROPRIATE 
ACTIONS WHICH INCLUDE REVOKING 
VISAS, ENTERING VISA LOOKOUTS, 
AND OTHER MEASURES. 
WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH THE 
TREASURY DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW 
THE APPLICABILITY OF SANCTIONS 
TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. 
THESE PENALTIES WILL NOT BE THE 
LAST WORD ON THIS MATTER FROM 
THE UNITED STATES. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE 
ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO HOLD 
THOSE RESPONSIBLE. 
-- ACCOUNTABLE. 
WE ARE MAKING VERY CLEAR THAT 
THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT 
TOLERATE THIS KIND OF RUTHLESS 
ACTION TO SILENCE MR. KHASHOGGI,
A JOURNALIST, THROUGH VIOLENCE. 
WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A 
STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THE 
KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA. 
NEITHER THE PRESIDENT NOR I AM 
HAPPY WITH THIS SITUATION. 
OUR SHARED STRATEGIC INTERESTS 
WITH SAUDI ARABIA REMAIN. 
WE CONTINUE TO DO AS 
ACHIEVABLE, THE TWIN 
IMPERATIVES OF PROTECTING 
AMERICA, AND HOLDING 
ACCOUNTABLE THOSE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE KILLING OF MR. 
KHASHOGGI. 
FOURTH. 
LAST WEEK, A DELEGATION OF 
CUBAN DIPLOMATS THROUGH A 
CHILDISH TEMPER TANTRUM AT A 
U.S. SPONSORED GATHERING. 
AT THE U.N., WAS A MEETING TO 
HIGHLIGHT THE CUBAN REGIME'S 
ITOLERANCE OF POLITICAL 
OPPOSITION AND THE PLIGHT OF 
LISTENERS. 
IN RESPONSE, I HAD WRITTEN A 
LETTER TO YOU WHEN SECRETARY 
GENERAL REQUESTING TO KNOW WHAT 
MEASURES THE U.N. WILL TAKE TO 
RESPOND TO THESE ACTIONS AND 
MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT HAPPEN 
AGAIN. 
AND FINALLY, IT'S MY HONOR TO 
TELL YOU THAT AMBASSADOR DAN 
SMITH WILL BECOME DIRECTOR OF 
THE NEW FOREIGN SERVICE 
INSTITUTE, SOMETHING I INTEND 
TO DEVOTE A SIGNIFICANT PIECE 
OF MY TIME AND ATTENTION TO AS 
SECRETARY OF STATE. 
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT 
INSTITUTION FOR OUR FOREIGN 
SERVICE OFFICERS. 
DAN WILL LEAVE THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT INSTITUTIONALLY 
POSSIBLE FOR ALL OF OUR TEAM'S 
TRAINING AND THEIR CONTINUE 
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. 
DAN SHARES MY VISION. 
I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS HEAD OF 
I&R AND I WAS IN MY PREVIOUS 
ROLE. 
DAN SHARES MY VISION OF HAVING 
THE BEST TRAINED AND MOST 
PROFESSIONAL DIPLOMATIC CORPS 
IN THE WORLD.  
HE IS IMPECCABLY QUALIFIED FOR 
THIS ROLE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO 
HIM TAKING THE HELM AT FSI. 
I'M NOW HAPPY TO TAKE A FEW 
QUESTIONS. 
>> HE DOES HAVE A FEW MINUTES 
FOR QUESTIONS TODAY. 
WE ARE RUNNING LATE. 
MY APOLOGIES. 
>> THANKS, HEATHER AND MR. 
SECRETARY. 
>> I DON'T KNOW IF WE COULD ADD 
COLOR TO THE PRESIDENT'S 
COMMENTS, YOU JUST CALLED THE 
SAUDI OPERATION, OR THE ATTEMPT 
TO CONCEAL THE WORST COVER UP 
IN THE HISTORY OF COVERUPS. 
AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU AGREE 
WITH THAT CHARACTERIZATION. 
AND SECOND, IF YOU COULD BE 
LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT 
THE ACTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE 
VISA REVOCATIONS, HOW MANY, 
ROUGHLY, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. 
AND, THE MIGRANTS. 
WE ARE HOPING TO BE -- A LITTLE 
BIT DISINGENUOUS, WHEN THIS 
ADMINISTRATION HAS SLASHED THE 
NUMBER OF REFUGEES  THAT WILL 
ADMIT. 
>> I SAID I WOULD TAKE A COUPLE 
OF QUESTIONS, YOU JUST ASKED 
THREE. 
I ASSUME EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM 
WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IN YOU FOR 
TAKING ALL THE QUESTIONS. 
LET ME TAKE THE LAST ONE FIRST. 
THIS IS A NATION THAT IS 
HISTORICALLY GENEROUS FOR 
ACCEPTING REFUGEES FROM ALL 
AROUND THE WORLD. 
THERE IS NO MISTAKING THAT. 
IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO. 
THOSE WHO WANT TO COME HERE 
ILLEGALLY HAVE NEARLY EVERY 
MEANS AVAILABLE TO DO THAT. 
PEOPLE CAN ALSO FILE TO BE 
REFUGEES IN OTHER COUNTRIES 
OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA. 
WHAT WE KNOW IS THIS. 
WE ARE A NATION BUILT ON LAWS. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS AN OBLIGATION 
TO PROTECT AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY 
AND TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS TO 
MAKE SURE WE KNOW WHO IS COMING 
IN AND OUT OF OUR COUNTRY IS 
NOT ONLY APPROPRIATE, BUT IS A 
DUTY OF THE UNITED STATES 
GOVERNMENT. 
WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE 
CONTINUE TO EXECUTE THAT WITH 
GREAT VIGOR AND PROFESSIONALISM.
SECOND, I WILL GET YOU THE 
NUMBERS. 
WE HAVE THEM, BUT I WANT TO 
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY GETS A 
CHANCE TO SEE THE NUMBERS. 
THERE IS NOT A LOT MORE I CAN 
SAY, OTHER THAN TO SAY THIS IS 
CERTAINLY NOT THE LAST STEP 
THAT WE WILL TAKE. 
THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO OUR 
OWN EFFORTS, OUR OWN FACT-
FINDING, TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
DECISIONS THAT THE UNITED 
STATES MAKES ARE BASED ON REAL 
DATA AND FACTS THAT WE CAN 
CONFIRM OURSELVES. 
WE WILL TAKE INFORMATION THAT 
COMES FROM OTHER SOURCES, THE 
TURKISH INTELLIGENCE SOURCES, 
THE SAUDIS. 
WE WILL VALIDATE THAT 
INFORMATION AND FORM OUR OWN 
JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE FACTS AND 
THEN HOLD THOSE RESPONSIBLE 
ACCOUNTABLE,  BASED ON THE FACT 
THAT WE DETERMINE ARE 
APPROPRIATE. 
WE WILL WORK WITH CONGRESS. 
I HAVE SPOKEN TO OUR ALLIES 
AROUND THE WORLD. 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE 
UNITED STATES DOES NOT BELIEVE 
THAT THE KILLING OF JAMAL 
KHASHOGGI WAS ANYTHING OTHER 
THAN A HORRIFIC ACT. 
AND WE HOPE WE CAN WORK 
TOGETHER BOTH WITH CONGRESS AND 
OUR ALLIES TO HOLD THOSE 
RESPONSIBLE ACCOUNTABLE. 
>> MR. SECRETARY, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH. 
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AFGHAN 
ELECTION. 
IT WAS VERY UNIQUE. 
WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT. 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, PAKISTAN DID 
SOMETHING WRONG. 
AS YOU KNOW, THE INCIDENT, 
GENERAL ROZIQ HAS BEEN KILLED. 
SOME REPORTS SAID THAT PAKISTAN 
WAS BEHIND THAT ACTION.  
DO YOU THINK THAT IF PAKISTAN 
DOES NOT CHANGE THEIR POLICY, 
WHAT WILL BE THE NEXT ACTION TO 
PAKISTAN? 
TO CHANGE THEIR POLICY TOWARD 
AFGHANISTAN? 
>> I HAD A CHANCE TO TRAVEL AND 
MEET THE NEW LEADER TOO MANY 
WEEKS AGO. 
WE MADE CLEAR THAT THE U.S. 
POLICY WITH RESPECT TO SOUTH-
CENTRAL ASIA HAS NOT CHANGED. 
THAT OUR EXPECTATION WITH 
PAKISTAN WILL NOT PROVIDE SAFE 
HARBOR TO TERRORISTS, ON THE 
WESTERN BORDER. 
WE COULD NOT HAVE MADE THAT 
ANYMORE CLEAR AND THAT PAKISTAN 
WILL NOT HOLD THAT ACCOUNTABLE 
IF THEY ARE NOT SINCERE IN 
THEIR EFFORTS. 
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE CAN 
GET TO THE PLACE WHERE EVERYONE 
WANTS. 
EVERYONE WANTS RECONCILIATION 
IN AFGHANISTAN. 
AND TO ACHIEVE THAT, WE CANNOT 
HAVE A SAFE HARBOR FOR TELE-
BAN, AND FOR OTHERS INSIDE OF 
THE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT. 
THAT'S OUR VIEW. 
ARE ADMINISTERED AND HAS MADE 
SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO HOLD 
THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND WE HOPE 
THEY WILL ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT 
WE HAVE SET OUT FOR THEM. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. 
SECRETARY. 
GIVEN THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS, 
ABOUT THE WORST COVER UP EVER, 
DOES THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
STILL HAVE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE 
IN THE CROWN PRINCE MOHAMMED 
BIN SALMAN, AS A RELIABLE 
SECURITY PARTNER OF THE UNITED 
STATES, OR IS THERE A BELIEVE 
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PART OF 
THE COVER-UP AND SHOULD 
TEMPORARILY STEP ASIDE UNTIL IT 
CAN BE INDEPENDENTLY 
ESTABLISHED, WHETHER HE PLAYED 
A ROLE OF ANY KIND IN THE 
KILLING OF MR. KHASHOGGI? 
>> WE ARE LEARNING THE FACTS. 
AND, AS FACTS UNFOLD, AND WE 
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP OUR 
UNDERSTANDING OF INDIVIDUALS 
THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS, 
WHO NOT ONLY EXECUTED IT, BUT 
LED, AND WERE INVOLVED AND 
CONNECTED TO IT, THE WORLD 
SHOULD KNOW THAT WE INTEND TO 
HOLD THOSE INDIVIDUALS 
ACCOUNTABLE WHEN WE DEVELOP 
THAT FACT THAT. 
AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO 
LEARN FACTS. 
WE LEARNED A LOT OVER THE LAST 
FEW DAYS. 
WE HOPE TO LEARN A LOT IN THE 
NEXT 48 AND 72 HOURS. 
>> OUR LAST QUESTION. 
>> FOLLOWING UP, PRESIDENT 
ERDOGAN SAID TODAY THAT THIS 
WAS A SAVAGE AND PREMEDITATED 
MURDER.  
YOU SAID THAT THE SAUDI'S ARE 
NOW TELLING US THAT THIS WAS AN 
ATTEMPT TO HOLD KHASHOGGI IN A 
TURKISH SAFE HEALTH -- HOUSE 
FOR TWO DAYS. 
YOU WERE PERSONALLY TOLD ONE 
STORY, AND IT HASN'T EVOLVED 
FOR DAYS. 
DO YOU THINK THAT THE SAUDI'S 
ARE STILL COVERING THIS UP? 
AND DO YOU FEEL MISLED BY THEM? 
DO YOU FEEL PERSONALLY MISLED 
BY THE CROWN PRINCE? 
DO YOU ACCEPT WHAT PRESIDENT 
ERDOGAN HAS SAID TODAY? 
>> I DON'T THINK I'VE SAID WHAT 
IT IS THE CROWN PRINCE TOLD ME. 
I STILL DO NOT INTEND TO. 
WE ARE GOING TO ACCEPT WHAT 
AMERICA LEARNS. 
ARE GOING TO ACCEPT THE DATA SET
THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED. 
WE HAVE PEOPLE WORKING ALL 
ACROSS THE WORLD. 
WHICH FACTS WE CAN DETERMINE TO 
PUT OUR UNDERSTANDING TOGETHER. 
BECAUSE, THINGS LIKE -- HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT THE WORK THAT 
WE'VE ASKED THE TREASURY TO 
HELP WITH, THAT'S GOT TO BE OUR 
WORK. 
WE HAVE TO DEVELOP OUR OWN DATA 
SET IN WHICH WE HAVE RELIABLE 
EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO BASE SUCH 
A JUDGMENT TO FIND SOMEONE AS 
HAVING VIOLATED U.S. LAW. 
WE WILL VALIDATE IT, WE WILL 
VERIFY IT AND LEARN THE FACTS 
FOR OURSELVES. 
THE TURKS HAVE BEEN VERY 
COOPERATIVE WITH THIS. 
>> HAS ANYBODY HEARD OFFICIAL 
AUDIO OR SCENE VIDEOTAPE? 
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TO 
SHARE WITH YOU ABOUT PARTICULAR 
DATA SETS. 
AS WE DO, I ASSURE YOU WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU INFORMED. 
WE WILL SHARE THOSE FACTS. 
AND MORE IMPORTANT, WE WILL SEE 
THE UNITED STATES HOLD THE 
PERSONS WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE 
HELD ACCOUNTABLE, HOLD THEM 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
I WILL TAKE ONE MORE, HEATHER. 
WHAT DO YOU GOT? 
>> THE SENATE AND HOUSE, THEY 
ASSIGNED THEM. 
IT IS NOW ON THE DESK OF THE 
PRESIDENT. 
IS THE PRESIDENT NOT EXPECTED 
TO DESIGN THIS BILL SOON? 
OR BEFORE OR AFTER THE 
ELECTION? 
>> I DON'T KNOW THE TIMING ON 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT INTENDS TO 
SIGN THAT. 
THANK YOU, ALL. 
HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON. 
>> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING INTO 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 
SPEAK AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT. 
MORE NEWS AHEAD. 
>>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A 
QUICK BREAK AND HAVE A LOT MORE 
AHEAD. 
STICK WITH US. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
CBS NEWS.  
>>> WELL, TONIGHT'S MEGA 
MILLIONS JACKPOT IS AT A RECORD 
HIGH $1.6 BILLION. 
THE LUMP SUM OPTION HAS 
ACTUALLY REACHED $904 MILLION. 
PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE 
FLOCKING TO STORES TO BUY THOSE 
TICKETS. 
JOINING US NOW, CBS NATIONAL 
CORRESPONDENT MARK STRASSMAN ON 
THE GROUND THERE IN GEORGIA, 
WHERE PEOPLE ARE CROSSING THE 
STATE LINE BORDER THERE FROM 
ALABAMA TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE 
TICKETS. 
SO, WHAT'S THE MOOD? 
DO PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE GOING 
TO WIN? 
>> IT'S REALLY AN AMAZING SCENE 
AND HAS BEEN ALL DAY. 
THIS CONVENIENCE STORE SELLS 
MORE LOTTERY TICKETS THAN ANY 
OTHER IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA, 
BECAUSE IT'S 5 MILES AWAY FROM 
THE ALABAMA GEORGIA STATE LINE. 
ALABAMA DOES NOT HAVE A MEGA 
MILLIONS. 
MOST OF THESE FOLKS HAVE COME 
FROM ALABAMA. 
THEY HAVE BEEN COMING IN STRONG 
ALL DAY. 
BY MIDMORNING, THE LINE WAS 50 
PEOPLE DEEP AND IT HAS BEEN OUT 
THE DOOR FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF 
HOURS. 
AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, WHEN A 
JACKPOT REACHES WORLD RECORD 
LEVELS, THERE IS POTENTIALLY A 
HIGHER POTENTIAL BEFORE THE 
DRAWING AND EVERYONE IS COMING 
HERE WITH MAJOR DREAMS OF 
WINNING THIS THING. 
ONE PERSON SPEND $1100. 
ONE COMPANY IS DROPPING 20, 40, 
$60, AND THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO 
WIN A CRAZY AMOUNT OF MONEY. 
>> BUT MARK, WHAT ARE THE ODDS 
OF WINNING TONIGHT AT THIS 
POINT? 
>> Reporter: NOT GOOD. 
ONE IN 300 MILLION. 
302 MILLION OR SO IS WHAT THE 
ODDS ARE. 
AND, HERE'S THE INTERESTING 
THING.  
BECAUSE THE JACK POT HAS ROLLED 
OVE SO MANY TIMES, BY 
TONIGHT'S RAWING, IT'S 
ESTIMATED THAT 75% OF ALL THE 
POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS HAVE BEEN 
SOLD. 
BUT THE EXPECTATION AT THIS 
POINT IS THAT THERE MAY BE MORE 
THAN ONE WINNER. 
BUT OF
