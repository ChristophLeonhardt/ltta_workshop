on November 9th 2016 the day after the Trump Clinton presidential election the CEO of the data firm that the Trump campaign had used during the election they put out a proud statement about what had just happened they put out a statement that said quote we are thrilled that our revolutionary approach to data-driven communications played such an integral part in president elect Donald Trump's extraordinary win that statement in response to the news that Donald Trump had just won the presidential election that was from the CEO of the firm Cambridge analytic I Alexander Knicks today Alexander Knicks was removed from the firm Cambridge analytical the company's board of directors announcing that they're removing him as CEO pending an immediate investigation into his recent statements about the company's practices in recent election campaigns this follows a third day of reporting from Britain's channel 4 including new tape today where Alexander Knicks proudly explains what his company's role was in getting Donald Trump elected have you met mr. Bach many times you have searched all the data analytics in addition campaign all the research all the data all the analytics all the targeting we ran all the digital campaign the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy we did it basically that CEO Trump's campaign Trump campaigns data firm is now out at that company as of tonight British investigators are seeking search warrants for the company's servers and databases here in the United States the Federal Trade Commission has now announced an investigation into Facebook because of its dealings with this company and in the context of the ongoing special counsels investigation by robert muller and his team of prosecutors questions are now being raised about several aspects of this firm and its work for the Trump campaign including this new revelation from a whistleblower from the firm's former research director who says the core data that the firm was built around the the spine of the company was data that was obtained for the company from Facebook illicitly by a russian-speaking Cambridge University professor who had a joint appointment at a Russian University and who's been getting research grants from the Russian government the same whistleblower from Cambridge analytic is also reporting that a Russian oil company close to the Putin government also took meetings with Cambridge analytic ah ahead of the u.s. presidential election meeting specifically focused on techniques to influence American voters why would a Russian oil company care about that so that's all sort of roiling the background right in today's news the president reportedly approaching yet another Republican Super Lawyer to try to add some talent to his Russia legal team Washington Post reporting that the President's request to former Solicitor General Ted Olson came quote as the president is feeling more vulnerable to the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Muller the president has told confidants he wants to recruit top-tier talent for his legal team which is probably not a very nice thing for his existing not necessarily top-tier legal team to read in The Washington Post but alas Ted Olson has turned down the president has turned down the president who requested that he joined his Russia team this comes after at least one other blue chip lawyer in recent days has also reportedly turned down the president but the mere fact the president is trying to get new lawyers on board at this late date tells you something of how serious things have become in recent days or how newly serious the White House perceives them to be our closest overseas ally in the world is Great Britain I think they I mean they still I mean at least that's what we've all thought for the past several generations let's just assume there's still our most important overseas allied as such it's important to us as a country that Britain right now is dealing with an incredibly serious situation of their own the attempted assassination of two people on British soil for which there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable it is Russia that is in flagrant breach of international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention we will never tolerate a threat to the life of British citizens and others on British soil from the Russian government we are quarry our quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin and with his decision and we think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK on the streets of Europe for the first time since the Second World War that is that is why we are at odds with Russia the United Kingdom will now expel 23 Russian diplomats who have been identified as undeclared intelligence officers they have just one week to leave those Russian diplomats undeclared intelligence officers they got kicked out of the UK today we've actually got footage of them leaving these are the Russian diplomats and their families altogether the Russian embassy says it was about 80 people in total bundled into vans and taken to Stansted Airport outside London where they then boarded a Russian stay onde plane which flew them all to moscow these diplomats or undeclared intelligence agents they were expelled by britain today as punishment for the nerve agent poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei scribble and his daughter Yulia in the British city of Salisbury an attack that Britain and its European allies and the US government all agree was carried out by the Russian government one of the reasons everybody's so certain this poisoning was carried out by the Russians is that the nerve agent used in the attack was invented by the Russians they're the only ones on earth who are known to possess it it's a class of nerve agents called Nova chucks and when you're dealing with a proprietary secret military weapon that incidentally is illegal and that only one country has it's particularly scary to think about something like that being brought into a provincial town in Britain and used in an attempted assassination but even beyond the fear factor just as a practical matter we as the general public can't even really imagine what this particular agent might physically do to people when it's used on them since the scribbles were attacked on March 4th more than two weeks ago it is striking how little we found out about the condition of the two people who were attacked we know that Sergei and Yulia scripto have been in the hospital in critical condition since they were both found slumped on a bench on March 4th we are told they are both still alive but that's it today a Russian publication called the Bell ran an interview with a man who says that he helped create this class of nerve agents for the Russian military and if what this scientist says is true it's a lot more information but it's not the kind of information I'm I'm not sure I'm happy to know this information it's unsettling in the Bell today this reporter asked the scientist quote is there even a minimal chance that the victims of this poisoning might recover he replies quote most likely they will suffer the same fate as earlier victims there is no antidote to these agents I can say with nearly 100% certainty that if strip Paul and his daughter are taken off of life support they will die although they are now only technically alive so that's the assessment of this man who says he was one of the creators of this Russian nerve agent we posted a link to the bells English translation of that interview on our website tonight fair warning it will keep you up that scientist though also says that the Russian government manufactured this type of nerve agent in the 1970s in the 1980s in batches as large as several kilos as in several kilograms he says he has no idea what happened to those stockpiles quote large doses were stored in a special warehouse in sealed packaging I don't know anything else about what then happened to those doses beyond where they were stored so that's the situation in our closest overseas ally right now two people remain in critical condition after an attack with a Russian nerve agent the existence of which is a surprise to most people on earth let alone its appearance on a British park bench 23 diplomats and their families expelled as of today the UK's leaders condemning Russia in the strongest possible terms oh and another death of another Russian Kremlin critic on British soil now being investigated by British counterterrorism police in a murder inquiry his death eight days after the script attack it's very serious stuff in Britain right now meanwhile here in the United States it was just five days ago that the Trump administration finally enacted some sanctions on Russia for their interference in our election in 2016 after slow walking for months the sanctions that the Trump administration was legally required to impose on Russia after denying the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia was responsible for that attack finally five days ago the US government under Donald Trump finally admitted that yes the Russians did mess with our election and yes we will okay agree to do something about it and so they finally for the first time put these sanctions on that was five days ago also five days ago the very same day the US finally issued these sanctions on Russia for its actions in the 2016 election at the same time that same day we also got this very serious technical announcement from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security about Russian government attackers going after American infrastructure specifically going after US power plants this technical alert from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI announcing that Russian government entities have hacked into u.s. power plants not just to mess with them or steal data but so they would have the ability to turn the American electric grid on and off at will it's been sort of an intense couple of weeks right poisoning two people with a previously unknown nerve agent in broad daylight on the streets of Britain freaking serious right hacking into the American electric grid so as to have the power to turn it on and off it will also frigging serious not to mention all the election stuff right I mean Russia's behavior is a little bit off the hook right now and this morning this is what the president the United States had to say about it I had a call with President Putin and congratulated him on the victory his electoral victory the call had to do also with the fact that we will probably get together in the not-too-distant future we had a very good call and I suspect that we'll probably be meeting in the not-too-distant future so I think probably we'll be seeing President Putin in the not-too-distant future president Trump called Moscow to congratulate Vladimir Putin on his big election win this weekend which was easier to win because he wouldn't let his opponents run but just in case you missed the important part he repeated it three times for you such a good call he's such a good guy did I mention we're getting together in the not-too-distant future in the not-too-distant future where we getting getting together I think we'll be seeing him in the not-too-distant future oh and by the way the reason we knew there had been a call at all was because once again the Kremlin announced it quote although the conversation was constructive and businesslike with a focus on overcoming the accumulated problems in russian-american relations said the Kremlin this morning and then a reporter asked Trump about it because we've gotten word from the Kremlin and that allowed him to deliver the great news about scoring a meeting with Putin well not tonight Washington Post has one of these scoops that sounds like it was made up for a satirical movie about this kind of situation at the top of American political leadership Karolina David Nakamura and Josh dozy are now reporting that when the president decided to make this call to President Putin today he sort of went rogue even against his own advisors here's the lead of their story again this is almost unbelievable just listen to this president Trump did not follow specific warnings from his national security advisors when he congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin today on his re-election including a section in his briefing materials in all capital letters stating quote do not congratulate I'm just gonna leave that up on the screen there for a second so you can let that wash over you the president's national security advisors wrote him a note in all capital letters saying do not congratulate Putin for his sham election victory do not legitimize that fake election do not say congratulations all capital letters and then the president gets on the phone with them and says hey congratulations there's more mmm quote President Trump also chose not to heed talking points from aides instructing him instructing him to condemn Putin about the recent poisoning of a former Russian spy in the United Kingdom with a powerful nerve agent make sure you don't congratulate him and condemn him for the nerve agent thing earlier in the day we did have the heads-up from the White House that somehow that difficult subject just didn't come up and you said election meddling didn't come up with the call I'm curious did the recent poisoning and the United Kingdom come up in the car can't believe that was discussed in today's call you know it's funny you should mention I don't think that came up mm-hmm well now thanks to this new reporting from Carole lennick and her colleagues at the Washington Post we know that that subject didn't come up even after national security aides at the Y how specifically advised the president that if he was gonna call Putin he really needed to condemn Putin for that remember the US government has joined the UK in concluding that that nerve agent attack was committed by the Russian government and condemning that attack so the president aides say president's aides say if you're going to call the person who we as a US government have said is responsible for that attack you have to bring up that attack why would the president disregard that kind of advice why would the president blow off and thereby sort of legitimize a nerve agent attack on British soil that the US government has said was committed by Russia why would he neglect to mention that why would he forget to condemn that why would the president ignore the all capital letters warning do not congratulate when he nevertheless congratulate spoot in' and just ignores the nerve agent attack what's driving his behavior what is driving his behavior that is so different than what his own national security staff believe is the right thing for the country what explains the distance between what the president is doing and what his own national security staff say the President of the United States needs to do joining us now is Carol linic one of the reporters on this piece just published by the post tonight Carol congratulations on this scoop thanks for joining us glad to be here Rachel so the the phrasing in your report is that these were warning specific warnings to the president from his national security advisors do we know what kind of advisors these were the people within the administration who are giving the president this kind of advice so whenever the president has a call with a foreign leader there is usually a lot of effort put into briefing him about the important hot topics in that region what he's likely to be asked by the foreign leader and what issues that are really like the hot lists that he should address with that person and there's a panoply of people that are involved in putting together this information to prepare the president for an important call each one of these calls is is considered part of our foreign diplomacy and cue cards essentially I mean index cards are provided to kind of guide this president and others in the past through the call and apparently these staffers felt that it was important to make clear that they were key topics that should come up and some key things that shouldn't be said and the president seemed to basically choose for himself what he should do which is his right is it clear that the president did accept some of the other advice of his national security aides and these were on this Putin call in particular that this warning not to congratulate Putin this warning that he should make sure to condemn the nerve agent attack in the UK were those the only things that he disregarded advice about or do we know that's really all that we do know other than what the president and Sarah Sanders and some sources have said did were topics that came up in the meeting for example Syria and North Korea but but these are the two places where we know things kind of went off of the script and the reason that it is concerning is not because the the president has the right to make these decisions all on his own but there was a perception that it would not be very good given the current state of affairs we're under investigation here in the White House for potential campaign ties to Russians outreach from Russians to the Trump advisor team it wouldn't look too good because really our ally the the United Kingdom is now facing the attack on its own soil on a not a citizen but a person who was in their country that's considered very serious one of our allies is struggling with that issue and believes that the Russians are culpable it was not viewed as a particularly good idea to congratulate Putin on his election in this moment but the president chose to do it we've seen and you mentioned this in your piece and I thought this was an important reference that we've seen the president hold handwritten notes giving him sort of cues for conversations with people before this one famously where the fifth point on the rand written note was I hear you this is for a meeting with shooting sir after the Parkland Florida School massacre so we've seen the president get these kind of notes before what's particularly striking in this case is that we haven't learned about this all caps warning do not congratulate Putin the warning make sure to put to condemn Putin over the nerve agent we haven't learned this because somebody in the case of that like in the case of that shooting took a snapshot of the picture we managed to get a glimpse of it clearly people who are familiar with these warnings from the president's national security aides wanted to make it known to to national security reporters to you and your colleagues at the post that the president ignored this advice I don't want you to I'm not trying to get you to talk about your sources but is it your sense and your reporting that that this was an effort by the president's own staffers to kind of signal to him that what he did was wrong or that it was dangerous or to try to sort of raise the alarm about the president's behavior I'd be careful about intuiting too much about our sourcing I will tell you Rachel that after the president's call with Vladimir Putin there was quite a kerfuffle in the White House about what had just gone down a sort of oMG moment of what are we going to say about this call are we going to say that the president congratulated Putin well the Russians kind of took that choice out of the hands of the White House by announcing that that Trump had congratulated their leader but there was quite a burst of activity trying to figure out what to do so this became fairly widely known pretty quickly that's remarkable Caroline a national reporter for The Washington Post again congratulations on this this scoop this is obviously really important it's also just fascinating Thanks Thank You Rachel again just to underscore what Carole just said her phrase exactly quite a kerfuffle an OMG moment and a burst of activity in the White House to figure out how to make sense and explain this call between the president and Vladimir Putin today we had not known in advance this call was going to happen the Kremlin was first to announce it and now we are that the president ignored his national security aides direct advice that he should not congratulate Putin he went ahead and did it and that he should make sure to condemn the Russian nerve attack in nerve agent attack in the UK remarkable reporting remarkable story all right coming up next we're gonna go live to Austin Texas we are getting some new and important information about the reported explosion that sent one person to the hospital tonight in a city that is very much on edge after adjectives of a series of bombings in that Texas City we've got that live report coming up along with Senator
