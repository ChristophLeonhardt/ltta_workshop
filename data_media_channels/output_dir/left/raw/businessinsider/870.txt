00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,389
I know satire is great satire is

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:12,540
important if things stop at satirizing

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,790
someone or protesting someone in the

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,949
street and it stops at that I don't

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that is taking logical answer</font>

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,980
because at the end of the day what

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,260
really makes a difference our midterms

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,859
are elections is how you go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put</font>

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,410
the road to change those people who are

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,470
supporting that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of present I mean</font>

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,430
Trump is only part of the problem

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,680
problem is that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spineless</font>

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,640
publican majority Senate and Congress

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,820
who basically would go with Trump to any

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,270
lengths just to support his agenda and

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,760
this is the real threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you need is</font>

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,399
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> opposition in the Senate and</font>

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">really opposition in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> count in</font>

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,120
Congress<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how you actually stand</font>

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,050
up against shouting laughing protesting

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,210
the street is beautiful is amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

22
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,250
your right how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this further</font>

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,040
I tend a couple of Trump rallies it was

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,790
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you have a certain</font>

25
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,770
podium and you shout to people with any

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,350
empty rhetoric people would respond and

27
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,409
I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> icon of a mayor one of the</font>

28
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,420
little towns that were basically warming

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,640
to crowd before Trump to the stage and

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,860
he said if Strom didn't do anything if

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,860
he didn't repeal<font color="#CCCCCC"> Obamacare if you didn't</font>

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,810
make a fake there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that you</font>

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a wall will you</font>

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,250
still vote for Trump as people say it's

35
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,869
like all right sit there is absolutely

36
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,490
no place or reason here

37
00:01:37,490 --> 00:00:00,000
