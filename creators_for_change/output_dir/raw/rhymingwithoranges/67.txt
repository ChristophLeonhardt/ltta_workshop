1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
so I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> planned this video it may</font>

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,200
be slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> disjointed but I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I</font>

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,490
have things to say about this and if the

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,179
internet needs more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> something hits</font>

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,460
white middle-class men talking about

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">base so there's this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lady Rachel don't</font>

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,220
lays out who has I suppose been outed as

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,080
somebody who was identifying as black

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,390
for a significant<font color="#CCCCCC"> period of time despite</font>

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she is not actually black</font>

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,270
the term transracial has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> throwing</font>

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,010
around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet quite a lot in terms</font>

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,520
of if people can p transgendered and

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,700
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were born in the wrong</font>

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,239
gender as the wrong gender why Cannot

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,870
somebody be born and feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,570
part of a different race feel like they

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,170
should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> born white when they</font>

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,059
were black or black when they white I

20
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,890
don't want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that ladies</font>

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,960
case specifically but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk</font>

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the concept of trans racialism</font>

23
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,010
being a an acceptable term the more I

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,780
think about this the more I know that I

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,650
definitely stand on the side of I don't

26
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,720
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the two are acquainted I</font>

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,430
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that trans people who are</font>

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,590
transgender are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different to people</font>

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,509
who are claiming to be trans racial but

30
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,070
I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's healthy to talk about</font>

31
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">these kinds of things and these concepts</font>

32
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:27,810
so that we can get past them because

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,180
quite frankly people on the internet

34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,540
have either been shouting about it at me

35
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,780
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> woman's an idiot or they have</font>

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">been just skirting around the topic um</font>

37
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,200
so let's attack this head on<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,820
we should say is that actually

39
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,610
translation<font color="#E5E5E5"> ism was already a term and</font>

40
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,700
it referred specifically to people who

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">were adopted into families where the</font>

42
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,250
parents were of a different race to the

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,380
child that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they adopted these people</font>

44
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,090
were described as<font color="#E5E5E5"> translation and trans</font>

45
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,979
cultural because they straddled two

46
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,840
races here's the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I actually</font>

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,240
wanted to contribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the conversation</font>

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,090
in terms of this whole transracial issue

49
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,550
the the personal experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

50
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,990
to tie this into

51
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,910
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was having</font>

52
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,180
over email I believe with a young lady

53
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,970
who was straight who had a lot of LGBT

54
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,910
friends but was considering herself a

55
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,200
part of the LGBT community she was

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,810
confused and and angry I believe when

57
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,870
when she<font color="#E5E5E5"> told her friends who were</font>

58
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,790
lesbian and gay and queer and trans um

59
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,840
oh I'm I'm LGBT despite the fact that

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">she was straight woman and she was like</font>

61
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,440
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I identified with loads of stuff</font>

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,890
about where culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I want to be able</font>

63
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,540
to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friends and be part of</font>

64
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,870
their world so the response that I had

65
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,590
to her was you can still be part of

66
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,530
their world you can still fight for the

67
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,340
cause of equality but you are more

68
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,440
powerful as an ally than a tag along you

69
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">are more powerful as an LGBT ally or</font>

70
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,360
perhaps if we turn this on towards like

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way spectrum you're more powerful as</font>

72
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,550
a white person who fights for equal

73
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,920
rights of black people or<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Asian</font>

74
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,410
people or of any ethnic minority then

75
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,570
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are as somebody who appropriates</font>

76
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,760
that culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tries to make it your</font>

77
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,990
own there is appreciation and there is

78
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,750
like loving and partaking and and and

79
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,620
that side of transculturation but then I

80
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,730
think that you are damaging it and I

81
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,970
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the word diluting it which</font>

82
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,550
might lose quite a loaded term if you

83
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,110
then decide oh yeah I'm going to happen

84
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,510
the latch<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto this you are more</font>

85
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,410
powerful force for these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are</font>

86
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,420
minorities in whatever society you live

87
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,820
in if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are working from within the</font>

88
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,740
system with other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are from</font>

89
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,480
your points of privilege and fighting

90
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">their cause right I feel like the idea</font>

91
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,120
of being trans racial comes from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

92
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,510
place but it sees a a culture and

93
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,220
appreciates it

94
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,590
sometimes it comes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who feel</font>

95
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,180
oppressed and are latching<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to</font>

96
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,050
something to fight against and they want

97
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be part of that that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad</font>

98
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,180
thing but it's when wet when a minority

99
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,880
that has a history of having their

100
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">culture snatched away from them it's</font>

101
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,130
further having their identity kind of

102
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,560
squandered when<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially this is</font>

103
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,660
happening in the USA where race

104
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,740
relations are lucky shit right that's

105
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,020
why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about such a response and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

106
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,940
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear what you guys think I</font>

107
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,990
don't know if this video is helpful um

108
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,120
in some way you're better as an ally

109
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,480
than somebody who like hitches a ride

110
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well I open wrong with oranges I</font>

111
00:05:30,440 --> 00:00:00,000
hope I haven't offended anybody goodbye
