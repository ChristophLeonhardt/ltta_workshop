Bill: AMERICAN FLAGS AT NEARLY A QUARTER MILLION GRAVE MARKERS. IT IS A HOLIDAY TRADITION HERE, MAKE EVERY DAY AND MEMORIAL DAY FOR OUR FALLEN HEROES. ONCE AGAIN HE IS OUR "POWER PLAYER OF THE WEEK" ." WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING IT IT'S ONLY 24 NOTES, BUT IT IS SO MEANINGFUL TO THAT FAMILY. TALKING ABOUT PLAYING TAPS AT THE FUNERALS OF MILITARY VETERANS AND HE SHOULD KNOW. ♪ ♪ HE'S THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF AN ORGANIZATION ALL TOLD HOW MANY FUNERALS HAVE YOU DONE SINCE YOU STARTED BUGLES ACROSS AMERICA? 200,000. IN TEN YEARS. IT STARTED BACK IN 2001 CONGRESS GAVE EVERY EVENT THE RIGHT TO A FUNERAL WITH MILITARY HONORS. INCLUDING TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS INCLUDING TWO UNIFORMED OFFICER OFFICERS. THE PROBLEM WAS THE MILITARY ONLY HAD 500 BUGLER'S SO THEY SENT SOMEONE TO HER PLATE A RECORD OF TAPS ON A BOOMBOX OR AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE INSIDE A BUGLE. TOM DEY, WHO PLAYED IN THE MARINES IN THE '50s, DIDN'T LIKE IT. I CALL IT STOLEN DIGNITY THAT THESE VETERANS CAN GET LIFE TAPS WHEN WE ARE OUT THERE READY TO PERFORM LIFE TAPS. SO HE STARTED HIS ORGANIZATION INCLUDING 400 HORN PLAYERS WITHIN A YEAR. NOW WE HAVE 6,270 HORN PLAYERS. IT HAS BECOME QUITE AN OPERATION. THE DAY RUNS OUT OF HIS BASEMENT NEAR CHICAGO. FAMILIES CAN GO ON HIS WEBSITE TO ASK FOR A BUGLER. A MESSAGE IS SENT TO EVERY HORN PLAYER WITHIN 100 MILES OF THE FUNERAL. HE GIVES AWAY BUGLES AND HELPS WITH UNIFORMS WHILE THEY GET SUPPORT FROM FOUNDATIONS, HE RUNS A DEFICIT EVERY YEAR. HOW TO MAKE UP FOR THE SHORTFALL? BECO I KIND OF MAKE IT UP MYSELF. 215, $20,000 A YEAR. PROBABLY TEN. YOU FINISH THE FLAG HAS BEEN PRESENTED AND THEN THE FAMILY COMES OVER. THE KISSES, THE HANDSHAKES FROM THESE FAMILIES. NOTHING. NO AMOUNT OF MONEY COULD EVER BUY THE FEELING THAT I GET FROM THE FAMILY ONCE I FINISHED THE 24 NOTES BURIED WITH SOLDIERS KILLED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN PLUS 1800 VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II DYING EVERY DAY THERE IS A FLOOD OF FUNERALS. HE SAID HE WANTS TO KEEP GOING UNTIL HE DIES AND THEN LEAVE HIS ORGANIZATION IN SOLID SHAPE TO CARRY ON. I WANT EVERY FAMILY TO HAVE LIFE TAPS AT THAT GOING AWAY PRESENTATION OF THEIR VETERAN AND IT KIND OF TELLS THE MARINES WERE GUARDING THE GATES IN HEAVEN, LIFE TAPS, WE ARE GOING TO LET THIS VETERAN RIGHT IN. SINCE WE FIRST RAN THAT STORY NINE YEARS AGO THEY HAVE GROWN TO MORE THAN 5,000 ACTIVE MEMBERS WHO PLAY AT MORE THAN 4,000 FUNERALS EVERY MONTH. IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE GO TO
