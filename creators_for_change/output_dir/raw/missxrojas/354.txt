5
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,099
seconds I was on a panel about women on

6
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,019
YouTube I spoke quite a few of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you after</font>

7
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,490
the panel<font color="#CCCCCC"> and kind of general response I</font>

8
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,380
got was an overall positive one but also

9
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,700
the sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this was the start of</font>

10
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,770
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new there shouldn't be a new</font>

11
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,210
conversation considering some of the

12
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,100
most influential youtubers were you know

13
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">women and I was writing to hand me the</font>

14
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,070
other night about ideas of how we could

15
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,570
keep this going it means how we don't

16
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,890
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose that momentum we don't want</font>

17
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,090
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose that creative energy so</font>

18
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,740
basically what I'm saying is let's keep

19
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,210
the discussion going welcome to the

20
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,369

25
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,500
continuing the discussion starting

40
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,869
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know Jane Austen</font>

41

48
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,150
kind of everything I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

49
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,740
what is the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem facing</font>

50
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,380
female content creators today and any

51
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,060
solutions I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's harassment</font>

52
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,130
and perhaps a lack of online structure

53
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,720
to deal with the harassment because you

54
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,189
can't release the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet at the same</font>

55
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,720
time there needs to be more safety in

56
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,369
place and whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> size needs to be</font>

57
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:39,600
placed on that rather than necessarily

58
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,369
the freedom of speech side of things

59
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:42,840
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think generally tends to</font>

60
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,310
dominate that conversation more

61
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,840
structure and more awareness about the

62
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,369
structure once that's in place<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

63
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:48,780
written a post on tumblr about safety

64
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,960
online and

65
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that the description bar below do</font>

66
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,200
you think achieve an online video in

67
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,940
general a better suited for tackling the

68
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,290
problems that women face in the

69
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,030
workplace and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the prejudices that women</font>

70
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,070
have to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than maybe television</font>

71
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,690
online<font color="#E5E5E5"> video suddenly has a potential</font>

72
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,550
especially as are more independent and

73
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,900
theory when we're being paid through

74
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube and you're being paid through</font>

75
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,900
networks there's no discrimination just

76
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,119
on the basis of being women it's more

77
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,250
about whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not you will get the</font>

78
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,959
views to me it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems more to be the case</font>

79
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,760
that disparity in pay between men and

80
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,440
women on YouTube is more down to people

81
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,060
choosing to watch mens videos rather

82
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,890
than women's if any such dispatching

83
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">sassoon that says there is a lot of</font>

84
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,890
power<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the audience but I don't know</font>

85
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,590
necessarily the problems with ageism or

86
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,780
heteronormativity or any of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

87
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,660
really necessarily automatically are

88
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,820
solved just by being<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet and</font>

89
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,680
having maybe a slightly wider audience

90
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,360
what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you pledge to do to make</font>

91
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet better place for all ages races</font>

92
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,840
genders classes or creatives I'm going

93
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steal this one from Laci green I'm</font>

94
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,080
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use my voice I think for too</font>

95
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,940
long I've absorb the ignore is the

96
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,890
internet mentality it's time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will use</font>

97
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,530
our voices so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> urge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use mine and to</font>

98
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,450
encourage other people to use guys as

99
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,100
well and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that good stuff is the</font>

100
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,959
first step towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it's only a</font>

101
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,239
step it's not you know a loop for my

102
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:02,829
entire anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> add this is a lady</font>
