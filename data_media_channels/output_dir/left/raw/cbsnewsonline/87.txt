1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:02,268
REMEMBER THAT. 

2
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,603
THEY ARE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE. 

3
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:06,005
THEY ARE MY FRIENDS. 

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:09,509
THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. 

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,210
I LOVE YOU, TOO. 

6
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,579
IT IS A GUY, BUT I LOVE YOU, 

7
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,782
TOO. 

8
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,117
YOU ARE PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY. 

9
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,652
YOU ARE PROUD OF OUR HISTORY. 

10
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:23,556
AND UNLIKE THE NFL, YOU ALWAYS 

11
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,726
HONOR AND CHERISH OUR GREAT 

12
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:31,531
AMERICAN FLAG. 

13
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:37,704
IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED BY ESPN, 

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,839
THAT RATHER THAN DEFENDING OUR 

15
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,474
ANTHEM, OUR BEAUTIFUL, 

16
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:44,544
BEAUTIFUL, NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND 

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,113
DEFENDING OUR FLAG, THEY HAVE 

18
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:53,786
DECIDED THAT THEY JUST WON'T 

19
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:54,787
BROADCAST WHEN THEY PLAY THE 

20
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:55,187
NATIONAL ANTHEM. 

21
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:57,724
WE DON'T LIKE THAT. 

22
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,858
SO, WHILE THE PLAYERS ARE 

23
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,994
KNEELING, SOME OF THEM, NOT ALL 

24
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,662
OF THEM, AT ALL. 

25
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:07,200
YOU ARE ALL PROUDLY STANDING 

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,169
FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM. 

27
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,939
THANK YOU. 

28
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:13,639
THE ESPN THING WAS TERRIBLE. 

29
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:20,180
IT JUST CAME OUT. 

30
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,214
UNDER OUR ADMINISTRATION, 

31
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:21,814
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN AND 

32
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:23,383
BEING RESPECTED AGAIN, ALL OVER 

33
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,450
THE WORLD. 

34
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,521
IT IS AMERICA FIRST. 

35
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:33,059
THIS IS THE GREATEST ECONOMY 

36
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,461
THAT WE HAVE HAD IN OUR 

37
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:34,961
HISTORY. 

38
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,764
THE BEST. 

39
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,898
OUR STEEL MILLS ARE BACK. 

40
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,800
THEY ARE ROARING BACK. 

41
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,139
WE ARE MAKING STEEL, AGAIN. 

42
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,540
UNITED STATES STEEL ANNOUNCED A 

43
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,678
MASSIVE INFUSION OF CASH. 

44
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,246
THEY ARE OPENING UP SEVEN 

45
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:57,750
DIFFERENT PLANTS. 

46
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,585
OTHER STEEL COMPANIES ALL OVER 

47
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,153
THE COUNTRY, THEY ARE OPENING 

48
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:04,857
UP PLANTS. 

49
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:06,092
PEOPLE SAID STEEL WOULD NEVER 

50
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:06,693
BE BACK. 

51
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,060
STEEL IS BACK. 

52
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,961
IT IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST 

53
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:09,762
INDUSTRIES IN OUR COUNTRY, 

54
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,998
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE 

55
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,266
WITH OUR TARIFFS. 

56
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:19,672
THEY WERE DUMPING STEEL ALL 

57
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:20,105
OVER OUR COUNTRY. 

58
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:20,807
DESTROYING OUR BUSINESS. 

59
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,375
THEY ARE NOT DUMPING SO MUCH, 

60
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,376
ANYMORE, AND IF THEY DO, THEY 

61
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,978
ARE PAYING A LOT. 

62
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,013
OUR MILITARY WILL SOON BE 

63
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,881
STRONGER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN 

64
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:31,284
BEFORE. 

65
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,887
WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR 

66
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:38,758
AMAZING VETERANS. 

67
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,794
AND I KNOW THIS DOESN'T MATTER 

68
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:46,833
TO YOU, BUT WE ARE PUTTING OUR 

69
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,970
GREAT COAL MINERS BACK TO WORK. 

70
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:09,422
GREAT PEOPLE. 

71
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:15,161
GREAT PEOPLE. 

72
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,896
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT, I 

73
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,397
TELL YOU. 

74
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:21,968
A LOT OF COURAGE. 

75
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:22,701
BUT WE LOVE CLEAN, BEAUTIFUL, 

76
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:24,237
WEST VIRGINIA COAL. 

77
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,307
WE LOVE IT. 

78
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:31,477
AND, YOU KNOW, IT IS 

79
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,981
INDESTRUCTIBLE STUFF. 

80
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,715
IN TIMES OF WAR, IN TIMES OF 

81
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:40,953
CONFLICT, YOU CAN BLOW UP THOSE 

82
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:41,253
WINDMILLS. 

83
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:46,859
THEY FALL DOWN REAL QUICKLY. 

84
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,094
YOU CAN BLOW UP THOSE PIPELINES 

85
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,495
THAT GO LIKE THIS, YOU ARE NOT 

86
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,565
GOING TO FIX THEM TOO FAST. 

87
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,267
YOU CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS TO 

88
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,268
THOSE SOLAR PANELS, BUT YOU 

89
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,470
KNOW WHAT YOU CAN'T HURT? 

90
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:57,670
COAL. 

91
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,805
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO 

92
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,972
COAL. 

93
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,040
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. 

94
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,042
WE ARE WORKING NOW ON A 

95
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,212
MILITARY PLAN THAT IS GOING TO 

96
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,180
BE SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL. 

97
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,283
I AM HONORED TONIGHT TO HAVE A 

98
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:15,688
FRIEND OF MINE. 

99
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:16,723
LET'S SAY IT IS BECAUSE OF 

100
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:17,322
POLICY. 

101
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:17,957
A DEMOCRAT. 

102
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,158
HE DECIDED TO BECOME A 

103
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:22,194
REPUBLICAN AND IT IS BECAUSE OF 

104
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:28,501
POLICY. 

105
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,936
I WANT TO BRING HIM UP, IF I 

106
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,203
CAN. 

107
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,304
CAN I BRING UP YOUR GOVERNOR? 

108
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,905
GOVERNOR BIG JIM JUSTICE. 

109
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,000
>> OKAY. 

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,537
I DEPUTIZED YOU, DID I NOT? 

111
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,673
THE OTHER THING I KNOW, YOU, AS 

112
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:10,276
WEST VIRGINIANS ARE 

113
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:15,014
APPRECIATIVE PEOPLE. 

114
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,416
JUST THINK, WE KNOW WHAT THIS 

115
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,084
GREAT MAN, RIGHT BESIDE ME, HAS 

116
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:23,523
DONE FOR US. 

117
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:45,478
NOW, LET ME SAY THIS. 

118
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,346
IT IS TIME FOR US TO SHOW THAT 

119
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,949
APPRECIATION AND DELIVER BACK. 

120
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,020
WE HAVE TO REELECT OUR HOUSE 

121
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,221
MEMBERS AND WE CANNOT, WHATEVER 

122
00:05:55,221 --> 00:06:03,362
WE DO, TO GOD ABOVE, WE CANNOT 

123
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:08,835
PUT IT ON THIS MAN. 

124
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:14,173
BUT IT GOES FURTHER THAN THAT. 

125
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,107
PATRICK MORRISEY IS A LITTLE 

126
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:17,577
BEHIND, RIGHT NOW. 

127
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,311
HE NEEDS YOU. 

128
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:24,083
HE NEEDS ALL OF YOU. 

129
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,485
HE NEEDS YOU TO GO OUT AND BE 

130
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,754
WARRIORS AND DEPUTIES FOR HIM. 

131
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:30,156
HE CAN WIN THIS AND THIS MAN 

132
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,123
NEEDS HIM. 

133
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:33,826
I WOULD SAY, GOD BLESS THIS 

134
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,294
GREAT MAN, GOD BLESS THIS GREAT 

135
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,396
COUNTRY, AND THANK YOU FOR 

136
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,498
HAVING ME. 

137
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:56,015
>> HE IS A BIG MAN. 

138
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,018
HE IS ALL MAN. 

139
00:06:59,018 --> 00:06:59,318
6'11". 

140
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,454
I WON'T TALK ABOUT THE WEIGHT. 

141
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,322
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WEIGHT 

142
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:03,488
IS. 

143
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:07,226
I WON'T GO THERE, BUT HE IS A 

144
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,361
BIG MAN AND A GREAT MAN. 

145
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,562
A WONDERFUL FRIEND OF MINE. 

146
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:15,668
IT IS REALLY NICE WHAT HE JUST 

147
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,270
SAID ABOUT THE MAN YOU WANT TO 

148
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,870
BE, YOUR NEXT SENATOR. 

149
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,671
THAT IS VERY NICE.

DEMOCRATS. 

177
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,914

BEST WAYS I CAN HELP PRESIDENT

262
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,734

263
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:20,840
PRESIDENT. 

264
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,141
WEST VIRGINIA NEEDS TO SEND A 

265
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,909

00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,598
NOW LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE 

271
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:45,798
BIT. 

272
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:49,201
I HAVE AN OPPONENT IN THIS 

273
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:49,434
RACE. 

274
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:53,205
HIS NAME IS DISHONEST, LIBERAL, 

275
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,874
JOE MANCHIN. 

276
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,243
LET ME BE CLEAR. 

277
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,112
LIBERAL JOE IS NO SUPPORTER OF 

278
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:04,049
THIS PRESIDENT. 

279
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,085
HE STRONGLY SUPPORTED AND VOTED 

280
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:10,222

281
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:15,027
HANG ON, HANG ON. 

282
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,495
AFTER SHE SAID, WE WILL PUT A

00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,863
LOT OF COAL MINERS AND COAL 

284
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,265
COMPANIES OUT OF WORK. 

285
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:24,369
YEAH, PRETTY BAD. 

286
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:25,905
JOE MANCHIN EVEN CALLED HILLARY 

287
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,374

TOUGH. 

289
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:34,947
CAN YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT? 

290
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,491
JOE HAS TO GO. 

291
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:55,000
LIBERAL JOE NO LONGER HAS WEST 

292
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,502
VIRGINIA VALUES. 

293
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:03,175
LET'S GO THROUGH THE RECORD. 

294
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,610
JOE MANCHIN WAS FOR OBAMA. 

295
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,110
HE WAS FOR HILLARY. 

296
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,779
HE HAS FOUR RADICAL GUN 

297
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,048
CONTROL, PLANNED PARENTHOOD. 

298
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,482
HE SHILLS FOR EPIPEN AND HE 

299
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:15,354
OPPOSED THE TRUMP TAX CUTS. 

300
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,424
PRETTY BAD, RIGHT? 

301
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,160
REMEMBER, THIS IS WEST VIRGINIA.

302
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,397
WE BENEFIT, AS MUCH OR MORE AS 

303
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,767
ANYONE, FROM THE TRUMP TAX CUTS.

304
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,606

00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,017
I AM GOING TO BE A STRONG ALLY 

308

AND WE WILL TACKLE THIS OPIOID 

314
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,363
EPIDEMIC, MORE AGGRESSIVELY 

315
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:04,670

316
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,305
IT IS MY HONOR TO BE HERE

SIMPLE CHOICE. 

364
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:04,522

HE VOTES FOR SCHUMER, NANCY 

372
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,046
PELOSI, THEIR NEW LEADER, 

373
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:32,017
MAXINE WATERS. 

374
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,621
BUT BETWEEN WATERS AND PELOSI, 

375
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:40,926
YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN 

376
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:41,560
CHARGE OF CONGRESS. 

377
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,395
THEY ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF WEST 

378
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:47,533
VIRGINIA. 

379
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,433
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT WEST 

380
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:48,833
VIRGINIA EXISTS. 

381
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:49,868
THEY DON'T LIKE COAL. 

382
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:54,706
THEY DON'T LIKE ENERGY. 

383
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,276
SO, WHEN YOU CAST YOUR BALLOT, 

384
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,946
FOR CONGRESS IN NOVEMBER, YOU 

385
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,516
WANT TO JUST VOTING FOR A 

386
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,784
CANDIDATE. 

387
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,019
YOU ARE VOTING FOR WHICH PARTY 

388
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:07,953
CONTROLS THE HOUSE AND WHICH 

389
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,790
PARTY CONTROLS THE SENATE. 

390
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,591
SO ALL THESE CONGRESS PEOPLE, 

391
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,727
AND I TELL YOU, WE HAVE TO GET 

392
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:15,961
 

393
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,631
WE REALLY HAVE TO GET THERE. 

394
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,133
I WILL BE GOING OUT AS MANY 

395
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:25,471
DAYS AS I CAN AND AM ALLOWED TO.

396
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,172
I HAVE A LITTLE, WITH ALL THE 

397
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:27,906
SECRET SERVICE, THEY ARE 

398
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,007
FANTASTIC PEOPLE, BUT IT SORT 

399
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,710
OF HOLDS YOU BACK. 

400
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,511
MAYBE SOMETIMES I WILL JUST 

401
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:37,282
MAKE A FEW TRIPS WITHOUT THEM. 

402
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,017
WE ARE GOING TO BE OUT A LOT. 

403
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,419
WE ARE GOING TO A LOT OF 

404
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,253
DIFFERENT STATES AND I AM 

405
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,288
COMING BACK HERE, BEFORE THE 

406
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:43,454
ELECTION. 

407
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,232
AND IT IS A VERY CLOSE 

408
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:53,499
ELECTION. 

409
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:57,469
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE. 

410
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,670
THERE IS A SIX POINT SPREAD. 

411
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,905
IT COULD BE ENDED, BY THIS 

412
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,172
EVENING. 

413
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,773
YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT HAS BEEN 

414
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:02,307
HAPPENING. 

415
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,008
WE HAVE HAD A GOOD RECORD OF 

416
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:09,414
ENJOYED -- RECORD OF 

417
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,682
ENDORSEMENTS IN GEORGIA. 

418
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,719
A GOOD MAN, THE GOVERNOR. 

419
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,288
HE WON, 70-30. 

420
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,993
SO, I GUESS HE PICKED UP 45 OR 

421
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:26,331
50 POINTS, IN OHIO RECENTLY. 

422
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,533
HE WAS UP, THEN HE WENT DOWN A 

423
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:29,201
LITTLE BIT. 

424
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,036
WE WENT THERE, AND HE WON. 

425
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,004
YOU KNOW THAT. 

426
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:36,108
BALDERSON, A GOOD MAN. 

427
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,944
CONGRESSMAN BALDERSON, NOW. 

428
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,512
WE WON EIGHT OUT OF NINE 

429
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,415
SPECIAL ELECTIONS. 

430
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,416
NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT. 

431
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,853
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. 

432
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,687
EIGHT OUT OF NINE SPECIAL 

433
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,921
ELECTIONS AND THEY DON'T WANT 

434
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:50,856
TO TALK ABOUT IT. 

435
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,893
MY RECORD, LOOK, I DON'T WANT 

436
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:58,964
TO BRAG ABOUT IT, BUT, MAN, I 

437
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,264
HAVE A GOOD RECORD OF 

438
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:03,502
ENDORSEMENT. 

439
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,803
IN FLORIDA WE HAVE A GREAT 

440
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:05,103
CANDIDATE. 

441
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:08,974
HE CALLED ME AND ASKED WHETHER 

442
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,408
OR NOT I COULD ENDORSE HIM. 

443
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:12,411
I SAID, LET ME CHECK IT OUT. 

444
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:16,515
HE WAS AT 3. THIS WAS A FEW 

445
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:16,915
MONTHS AGO. 

446
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:22,387
HE WAS AT 3. I GAVE HIM A NICE 

447
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,822
SHOT AND A LITTLE TWEAK AND HE 

448
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,658
WENT FROM 3 TO TWENTYSOMETHING. 

449
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:30,696
THEN I GAVE HIM MY FULL AND 

450
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:31,530
TOTAL ENDORSEMENT. 

451
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,433
HE IS NOW LEADING BY, LIKE, 19 

452
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:39,538
POINTS. 

453
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,672
AND THAT ELECTION IS NEXT WEEK. 

454
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:41,473
LEADING IN THE PRIMARY. 

455
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:48,613
A GOOD MAN. 

456
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:49,448
AND SO MANY OTHERS. 

457
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:49,815
STATEN ISLAND. 

458
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,416
THE CONGRESSMAN WAS DOWN. 

459
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:56,121
BEFORE THE ELECTION. 

460
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,656
WE ENDORSED HIM AND I THINK HE 

461
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,457
WON BY 24 POINTS. 

462
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,791
ALL MY LIFE I HAVE HEARD 

463
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,324
ENDORSEMENTS DON'T MEAN 

464
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:00,591
ANYTHING. 

465
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:02,026
THEY SAID IF YOU GET AN 

466
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:07,099
ENDORSEMENT BY RONALD REAGAN, 

467
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,834
WE LIKE RONALD REAGAN, IT WAS A 

468
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,935
WONDERFUL THING TO HAVE BUT IT 

469
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,738
DIDN'T MOVE THE NEEDLE. 

470
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,772
IS THAT A CORRECT STATEMENT, IF 

471
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,172
YOU LOOK? 

472
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,641
IF YOU GET AN ENDORSEMENT, IT 

473
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:18,510
WAS NICE IT HAPPENED, BUT IT 

474
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,014
DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING. 

475
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:22,748
THESE ENDORSEMENTS, THEY ARE 

476
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,149
GOING 20, 30, 40, 50 POINTS. 

477
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,217
50 POINTS. 

478
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:31,456
IT IS CRAZY. 

479
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,691
AND THEN YOU WATCH THE NEWS. 

480
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:33,959
WILL THIS ENDORSEMENT MEAN 

481
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,393
ANYTHING? 

482
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:42,033
IT IS GOING TO MEAN A LOT. 

483
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,468
AND I DON'T CARE, WE HAVE TO 

484
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,403
GET SENATORS IN. 

485
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,370
WE HAVE, REALLY, NO MAJORITY. 

486
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,504
WE HAVE, IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT 

487
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:51,976
IT, WE COULD PROBABLY SAY 49-

488
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:57,682
49.51-49. 

489
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:58,884
WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE 

490
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,018
UNABLE TO VOTE AND SOME PEOPLE 

491
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,055
THAT ARE A LITTLE UNRELIABLE. 

492
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,256
THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT I HAVE 

493
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:04,990
DONE TO THEIR CAREER. 

494
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,024
THEY DON'T LOVE WHAT I HAVE 

495
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:06,425
DONE. 

496
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:06,925
THAT IS OKAY. 

497
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,427
AND I DO NOT LIKE WHAT THEY 

498
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:08,860
HAVE DONE, EITHER. 

499
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,498
BUT WE NEED TO ELECT FIVE, SIX, 

500
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:20,005
OR EVEN SEVEN MORE SENATORS. 

501
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,206
AND I THINK WE CAN DO IT. 

502
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,708
I THINK WE CAN DO IT. 

503
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,675
AND WE HAVE TO START WITH 

504
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,709
PATRICK MORRISEY, HE IS GOING 

505
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:27,846
TO BE FANTASTIC. 

506
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,147
IF YOU VOTE FOR JOE MANCHIN, OR 

507
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,182
ANY OTHER DEMOCRAT IN NOVEMBER, 

508
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,819
YOU ARE VOTING FOR THE PARTY 

509
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,687
THAT WANTS TO REALLY DESTROY 

510
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,120
THE COAL INDUSTRY. 

511
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,961
PATRICK SAID IT. 

512
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:43,995
JOE ENDORSED HILLARY, 100% AND 

513
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,664
HE GOT ALONG WITH HER, EVEN 

514
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:49,868
BETTER, AFTER HE CAME OUT WITH 

515
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,203
A STATEMENT THAT HE WANTS TO 

516
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:51,870
DESTROY COAL AND COAL 

517
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,170
COMPANIES. 

518
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,106
THAT IS A BAD THING. 

519
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:56,241
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO TURN 

520
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,977
AMERICA INTO ONE BIG FAT 

521
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:03,348
SANCTUARY CITY. 

522
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,985
FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS. 

523
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:11,189
AND HONESTLY, HONESTLY, THEY 

524
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,224
ARE MORE PROTECTIVE OF ALIENS, 

525
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,359
THE CRIMINAL ALIENS, THEN THEY 

526
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,696
ARE OF THE PEOPLE. 

527
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,264
THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR 

528
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,367
SECOND AMENDMENT. 

529
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,802
YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. 

530
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:24,870
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT YOUR 

531
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,904
SECOND AMENDMENT PLAYED WITH. 

532
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,238
THEY WANT TO TAKE OVER THE 

533
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:31,042
MILLIKEN -- TAKE OVER AMERICAN 

534
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:34,546
HEALTH CORE -- HEALTHCARE AND 

535
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:38,049
USE OUR COURTS TO REWRITE THE 

536
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,217
CONSTITUTION. 

537
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:45,724
HOW DO YOU LIKE THE JUDGES I 

538
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,324
HAVE BEEN APPOINTING? 

539
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,126
THERE IS NO WORST NIGHTMARE FOR 

540
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:56,902
WEST NOVEMBER -- FOR WEST 

541
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:57,736
VIRGINIA THIS NOVEMBER, THEN 

542
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,503
CHUCK SCHUMER RUNNING THE 

543
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,404
SENATE AND NANCY PELOSI, WITH 

544
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,138
MAXINE WATERS, RUNNING THE 

545
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:00,472
HOUSE. 

546
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,007
THAT IS WHY YOU MUST VOTE 

547
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,010
REPUBLICAN. 

548
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,244
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. 

549
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,279
THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE 

550
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:07,679
BLUE WAVE. 

551
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,780
I DON'T SEE IT. 

552
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,714
WE HAVE THE GREATEST ECONOMY WE 

553
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:10,315
HAVE EVER HAD. 

554
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,551
JOE MANCHIN ALWAYS VOTED FOR 

555
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,786
OBAMA AND HE VOTED TO KEEP THE 

556
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:18,623
DISASTER KNOWN AS OBAMA CARE. 

557
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:23,128
I WILL TELL YOU, IT IS BEING 

558
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:23,461
CHIPPED AWAY. 

559
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:26,164
YOU KNOW, WE HAD IT BEATEN, BUT 

560
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,933
ONE MAN, AND I AM SURE NOBODY 

561
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,569
KNOWS WHO I AM TALKING ABOUT, 

562
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:36,274
VOTED NO. 

563
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:36,574
SHOCKINGLY. 

564
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:37,843
REALLY SURPRISING TO A LOT OF 

565
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:38,643
PEOPLE, BECAUSE HE CAMPAIGNED 

566
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,343
ON REPEAL AND REPLACE. 

567
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:41,012
BUT WE HAVE REALLY KNOCKED IT 

568
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,814
OUT. 

569
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,615
INCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL 

570
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:43,882
MANDATE. 

571
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,417
WE GOT RID OF THE MOST 

572
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,186
UNPOPULAR PART OF OBAMA CARE, 

573
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,988
WHERE YOU HAVE A PRIVILEGE OF 

574
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,756
PAYING A FORTUNE FOR NOT HAVING 

575
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,391
TO PAY A FORTUNE FOR REALLY BAD 

576
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,693
HEALTHCARE. 

577
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,827
WE GOT RID OF IT. 

578
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,596
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY HAPPY 

579
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:58,563
WITH THAT. 

580
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,764
THAT CAME ALONG WITH THE 

581
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:02,200
BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN OUR HISTORY.

582
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,269
AND JOE MANCHIN VOTED NO ON THE 

583
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:09,508
TAX CUTS. 

584
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,842
YOU KNOW, THE LAST TIME I WAS 

585
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,611
HERE I SAW SIGNS ALONG THE 

586
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,179
HIGHWAY, JOE, YOU VOTED NO ON 

587
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:14,646
TAX CUTS. 

588
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,148
AND JOE, YOU VOTED NO FOR OUR 

589
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:17,916
PRESIDENT. 

590
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,585
YOU VOTED NO. 

591
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,020
AND HE IS GOING TO VOTE NO. 

592
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,657
I AM NOT KNOCKING HIM, BUT 

593
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,291
SCHUMER IS THE BOSS. 

594
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:31,963
HE MAY GIVE US A VOTE ON 

595
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:32,396
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. 

596
00:25:32,396 --> 00:25:32,964
HE SHOULD. 

597
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:33,598
HERE IS A GUY. 

598
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:34,599
IS THIS CENTRAL CASTING? 

599
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,167
THIS IS WHAT WE WANT. 

600
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:41,773
A GREAT, BRILLIANT MAN. 

601
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,308
BUT HE IS NOT VOTING WITH US. 

602
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,775
HE HAS VOTING AGAINST YOUR TAX 

603
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:46,811
CUTS. 

604
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,013
HE VOTED AGAINST REPEAL AND 

605
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:48,280
REPLACE. 

606
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,347
HE VOTES AGAINST THE THINGS 

607
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,248
THAT WE WANT AND VOTES AGAINST 

608
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,017
THE PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA. 

609
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:58,189
YOU KNOW, JOE OPPOSED THE WALL 

610
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,525
AND HE OPPOSED THE TRAVEL BAN. 

611
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:05,397
BY THE WAY, THE WALL, RIGHT NOW,

612
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,498
THAT WALL IS COMING ALONG. 

613
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,934
OVER $3 BILLION. 

614
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:11,536
IT IS MOVING ALONG, VERY 

615
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:11,770
NICELY. 

616
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,370
VERY NICELY. 

617
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:17,275
AND IF YOU THINK IT IS EASY 

618
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,476
WITH THESE PEOPLE, IT IS NOT 

619
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:18,777
EASY. 

620
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,111
IT IS NOT EASY. 

621
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,348
WE ARE GETTING THE WALL BUILT. 

622
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:23,982
IT IS GOING UP. 

623
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:28,653
WE ARE GETTING IT BUILT. 

624
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,255
AND WE HAVE A BIG NUMBER IN, 

625
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:30,689
RIGHT NOW. 

626
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,636
SHELLEY AND COREY, YOU HEAR 

627
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:48,006
THAT, RIGHT? 

628
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,674
WE ARE LOOKING FOR $5 BILLION 

629
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:53,411
THIS YEAR, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN 

630
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,213
IT WILL BE FINISHED AND VERY, 

631
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:59,718
VERY EFFECTIVE. 

632
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,587
YOU HEARD ABOUT, TODAY, WITH 

633
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:08,460
THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, COMING IN, 

634
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,065
VERY SADLY FROM MEXICO. 

635
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,066
AND YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO 

636
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,401
THAT INCREDIBLE, BEAUTIFUL, 

637
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,204
YOUNG WOMAN. 

638
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,438
IT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. 

639
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:23,675
ILLEGALLY IN OUR COUNTRY. 

640
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,909
WE HAD A HUGE IMPACT, BUT THE 

641
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,544
LAWS ARE SO BAD. 

642
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:27,945
THE IMMIGRATION LAWS ARE SUCH A 

643
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:30,782
DISGRACE. 

644
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,716
WE ARE GETTING THEM CHANGED, 

645
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,586
BUT WE HAVE TO GET MORE 

646
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:35,687
REPUBLICANS. 

647
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,488
THIS ELECTION IS BIGGER THAN 

648
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,723
ANY ONE RACE. 

649
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,125
IT IS ABOUT WHETHER WE WANT TO 

650
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,294
CONTINUE THE AMAZING PROGRESS 

651
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,596
WE HAVE MADE FOR AMERICA OR 

652
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,463
WHETHER WE WANT TO SURRENDER 

653
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:48,066
THAT PROGRESS TO THE FORCES OF 

654
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:52,904
EXTREMISM AND OBSTRUCTION. 

655
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,572
YOU KNOW, THERE LITTLE PHRASE 

656
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,008
THAT THEY LIKE, RESIST. 

657
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,409
THAT IS ALL THEY ARE GOOD AT. 

658
00:27:58,409 --> 00:27:59,244
THEY HAVE NO POLICY. 

659
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,278
THEY ARE NOT GOOD POLITICIANS, 

660
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:02,480
BUT THEY ARE GOOD AT STICKING 

661
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,016
TOGETHER AND RESISTING. 

662
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,351
I HAVE ALMOST 400 PEOPLE THAT 

663
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:06,951
HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED. 

664
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:10,822
THEY ARE SLOW WALKING. 

665
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,590
WE HAVE ALMOST 400 PEOPLE IN 

666
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,958
OUR ADMINISTRATION. 

667
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:14,893
PEOPLE WHO GAVE UP THEIR 

668
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:18,930
CAREERS, WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING 

669
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,365
OVER A YEAR TO GET APPROVED AND 

670
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,133
THEY ARE BEING SLOW WALKED BY 

671
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,401
THE DEMOCRATS. 

672
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,636
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED THAT WAY 

673
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,604
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY 

674
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:27,639
AND IT IS A DISGRACE. 

675
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,874
IT IS A DISGRACE. 

676
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,177
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS HELD 

677
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:37,448
HOSTAGE, BY THE SO-CALLED 

678
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:37,748
RESISTANCE. 

679
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:38,650
THE LEFT WING HATERS AND A 

680
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:45,356
GREAT MOBS, TRYING TO TEAR DOWN 

681
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:45,957
OUR INSTITUTIONS. 

682
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:46,558
DISRESPECT OUR FLAG. 

683
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,224
DEMEAN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT, 

684
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:48,392
DENIGRATE OUR HISTORY AND 

685
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:49,594
DISPARAGE OUR GREAT COUNTRY. 

686
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,262
WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT 

687
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:54,899
HAPPEN. 

688
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,034
NEW YORK'S DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR, 

689
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:59,137
ANDREW CUOMO, EVEN DECLARED 

690
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,873
THAT AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT. 

691
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:07,278
OH, I SAID IT. 

692
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,313
TELL THAT TO OUR GREAT SOLDIERS 

693
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:12,317
IN WORLD WAR I. WORLD WAR II. 

694
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,352
KOREAN WAR. 

695
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,955
SO MANY OTHERS. 

696
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:23,528
TELL THEM TO THE FOLKS THAT 

697
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,396
SENT A ROCKET UP TO THE MOON, 

698
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,298
OUR GREAT ASTRONAUTS. 

699
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,433
TELL THAT TO ALL THE GREAT 

700
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,434
MEDICAL RESEARCH WE HAVE DONE 

701
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,135
IN THIS COUNTRY. 

702
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:35,306
HE SAYS AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT.

703
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,007
I WOULD IMAGINE, THAT IS CAREER 

704
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:38,476
THREATENING. 

705
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,211
HOW DO YOU GET AWAY WITH THAT 

706
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:40,612
ONE? 

707
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,849
DID YOU HEAR, HE WAS SPEAKING 

708
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,084
TO A ROOM LOADED UP WITH 

709
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:51,155
SOCIALIST AND PROBABLY OTHERS. 

710
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:52,357
NOT COMMUNISTS, BUT THERE COULD 

711
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,391
HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF THEM. 

712
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:57,195
AND HE MADE THE STATEMENT THAT 

713
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,063
AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT. 

714
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:02,833
DID YOU HEAR? 

715
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:06,971
THEY COULD NOT EVEN BELIEVE IT. 

716
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:13,311
THAT IS JOB THREATENING. 

717
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,412
HIS COMMENTS ARE AN INSULT TO 

718
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,213
THE GENERATIONS OF BRAVE 

719
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,347
AMERICANS WHOSE BLOOD AND SWEAT 

720
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,715
AND TEARS BUILT OUR MAGNIFICENT 

721
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:22,687
COUNTRY. 

722
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:23,655
SO, THIS NOVEMBER, YOU CAN 

723
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,323
EITHER VOTE FOR THE PARTY THAT 

724
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,426
SAYS AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT, 

725
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,460
THAT WILL BE THERE THEME NOW, 

726
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:35,466
AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT. 

727
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:35,833
LET'S DO THAT. 

728
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,266
THEY COPIED MINE. 

729
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:39,270
PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. 

730
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,471
LET'S GIVE THEM A NEW THEME, 

731
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,307
AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT. 

732
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,975
THAT IS THE DEMOCRATS NEW 

733
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:44,208
THEME. 

734
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:46,411
CAN WE DO THAT? 

735
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:50,882
YOU CAN VOTE PROUDLY FOR 

736
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:51,616
EVERYTHING WE STAND FOR. 

737
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,917
WE ARE THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN 

738
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,320
THE WORLD AND WE ARE NOW, WE 

739
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,690
ARE NOW THE GREATEST ECONOMY 

740
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:07,532
THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD. 

741
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,533
WE ARE THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN 

742
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,267
THE WORLD. 

743
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,368
WE HAVE GONE UP $10 TRILLION IN 

744
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,805
VALUE SINCE MY ELECTION. 

745
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,932
WE HAVE GONE UP $10 TRILLION. 

746
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:41,265
THINK OF IT? 

747
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:45,303
SINCE THE ELECTION. 

748
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,603
WASN'T THAT A GREAT ELECTION? 

749
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:49,340
BOY. 

750
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,241
REMEMBER I WAS HERE, JUST 

751
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,444
BEFORE THE ELECTION? 

752
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,645
AND I BROUGHT A COUPLE OF GUYS 

753
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:56,481
INTO A ROOM AND I SAID FELLAS, 

754
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,049
SUPPOSING WE TEACH YOU A NEW 

755
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:58,683
SKILL. 

756
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:05,223
SUPPOSING WE TEACH YOU HOW TO 

757
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,023
MAKE LITTLE WIDGETS OR GADGETS. 

758
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:07,492
THESE ARE BIG, STRONG COAL 

759
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,794
MINERS. 

760
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,863
THEY SAID, SIR, WE WANT TO DIG 

761
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:12,063
COAL. 

762
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,931
I SAID, I AGREE WITH YOU. 

763
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:16,601
REMEMBER THAT? 

764
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:23,074
THEY ARE GRANDFATHERS, THEY DID 

765
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:23,240
IT. 

766
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,674
FATHERS, DID IT. 

767
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:25,943
IT IS INCREDIBLE. 

768
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,311
IT IS REALLY HAPPENING. 

769
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:28,579
WE ARE BACK. 

770
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:32,417
THE COAL INDUSTRY IS REALLY 

771
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:32,617
BACK. 

772
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,085
SO, WHEN I CAME HERE 

773
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,053
ORIGINALLY, WEST VIRGINIA, 

774
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,522
FRANKLY, WAS DOWN AND OUT. 

775
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,358
IT WAS NOT DOING EXACTLY WELL. 

776
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:40,992
ONE OF THE LAST. 

777
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:44,929
YOU KNOW THAT A FEW MONTHS AGO, 

778
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,597
IT HIT WERE WEST VIRGINIA, ON A 

779
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,098
PER CAPITA BASIS, IS ONE OF THE 

780
00:32:48,098 --> 00:32:55,973
MOST SUCCESSFUL GDP STATES IN 

781
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:56,273
OUR UNION. 

782
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:57,842
SO WE WENT FROM BEING DOWN AND 

783
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,043
OUT, TO ONE OF THE MOST 

784
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:03,314
SUCCESSFUL IN THE UNION. 

785
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,148
VERY CLOSE TO THE TOP. 

786
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,450
THAT IS SOME BIG CHANGE. 

787
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:10,621
I HAVE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE. 

788
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,456
I WAS BACKSTAGE. 

789
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,824
PEOPLE ARE COMING UP TO ME. 

790
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,692
MISTER PRESIDENT, THANK YOU 

791
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:18,129
SIR, FOR SAVING OUR NATION. 

792
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:18,963
BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT 

793
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:19,263
THAT MEANS. 

794
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:24,769
WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. 

795
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,037
HAD THE OTHER SIDE ONE, THEY 

796
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:26,671
WOULD'VE POURED ON MORE 

797
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,673
REGULATIONS, RAISED YOUR TAXES. 

798
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,707
THEY WOULD'VE DONE THINGS THAT 

799
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,976
WERE SO BAD, YOU HAD A VERY LOW 

800
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:32,176
GDP. 

801
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:37,648
IT WAS 1.2%. 

802
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:38,549
IT WAS GOING DOWN. 

803
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,418
IT WAS GOING TO BE IN THE 

804
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:40,685
NEGATIVE. 

805
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,354
LAST QUARTER WE JUST HAD, 4.1%. 

806
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:50,228
AS YOU ALL KNOW. 

807
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,863
I ALWAYS SAY, IF I WOULD HAVE 

808
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,697
NEVER SAID THAT SHORTLY AFTER 

809
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,698
WINNING WE WOULD'VE HIT 4.1, 

810
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,401
THOSE PEOPLE BACK THERE 

811
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,036
WOULD'VE SAID THIS GUY, NO 

812
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:58,269
GOOD. 

813
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,103
FAKE NEWS. 

814
00:33:59,103 --> 00:33:59,937
FAKE NEWS. 

815
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:04,008
HOW FAKE ARE THEY? 

816
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:09,647
FAKE NEWS AND THE RUSSIAN 

817
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:09,947
WITCHHUNT. 

818
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,149
WE HAVE A WHOLE BIG 

819
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:11,482
COMBINATION. 

820
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:17,855
WHERE IS THE COLLUSION? 

821
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:18,790
THEY ARE STILL LOOKING FOR 

822
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,090
COLLUSION. 

823
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:19,690
WHERE IS THE COLLUSION? 

824
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,226
FIND SOME COLLUSION. 

825
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:29,132
WE WANT TO FIND THE COLLUSION. 

826
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:30,701
AT THE BEATING HEART OF THIS 

827
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:36,306
ELECTION, IS BORDER SECURITY. 

828
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:37,275
WE HAVE TO HAVE IT. 

829
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,176
WE HAVE TO HAVE IT. 

830
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,411
IOWA OFFICIALS AND SO MANY 

831
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,478
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN 

832
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:43,547
REPORTING NUMBERS WHERE THEY 

833
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:49,253
ARE HAVING A LOT OF PROBLEMS 

834
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,254
WITH PEOPLE COMING IN. 

835
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:50,955
PEOPLE ARE COMING IN. 

836
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,889
BUT WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT. 

837
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:57,261
WE HAVE MS-13 ON THE RUN. 

838
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,763
THEY POURED IN HERE WITH OBAMA. 

839
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,732
WE HAVE THEM ON THE RUN. 

840
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,734
BECAUSE WE LOVE THE MEN AND 

841
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:09,340
WOMEN OF I.C.E. 

842
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,278
A BLUE WAVE IN NOVEMBER, MEANS 

843
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,114
OPEN BORDERS, WHICH MEANS 

844
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:22,353
MASSIVE CRIME. 

845
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:23,588
A RED WAVE MEANS SAFETY AND 

846
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:23,854
STRENGTH. 

847
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:26,857
THAT IS WHAT IT IS. 

848
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:34,632
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE 

849
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,766
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS TO ABOLISH 

850
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:35,999
I.C.E. 

851
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:36,867
A VOTE FOR ANY DEMOCRAT IN 

852
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,636
NOVEMBER IS A VOTE TO ELIMINATE 

853
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:43,040
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. 

854
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,208
THEY WILL OPEN OUR BORDERS AND 

855
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,776
SET LOOSE VICIOUS CRIMINALS AND 

856
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,045
VIOLENT PREDATORS. 

857
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,280
THEY WILL BE ALL OVER OUR 

858
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,613
COMMUNITIES. 

859
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,582
THEY WILL BE PRAYING ON OUR 

860
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:52,316
COMMUNITIES. 

861
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,550
YET, WHILE MANY DEMOCRATS ARE 

862
00:35:53,550 --> 00:36:01,659
CALLING TO ABOLISH I.C.E. 

863
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,994
TODAY OUR BRAVE ICE OFFICERS 

864
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,627
SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED OUT A 14-

865
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:04,662
YEAR-OLD DEPORTATION ORDER 

866
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:09,967
AGAINST A TRAN 27 CRIMINAL 

867
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:10,801
LIVING IN NEW YORK. 

868
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:16,941
THE LAST KNOWN TRAN 27 LIVING 

869
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:17,508
IN THE UNITED STATES. 

870
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,809
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET 

871
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,579
HIM OUT FOR DECADES. 

872
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,613
PRESIDENT OBAMA TRIED. 

873
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:23,013
THEY ALL TRIED. 

874
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:25,116
WE GOT HIM OUT. 

875
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:25,316
GONE. 

876
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:25,850
HE IS GONE. 

877
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,054
BACK IN GERMANY. 

878
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,523
I.C.E. 

879
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:38,229
OFFICERS ARE HEROES WHO UPHOLD 

880
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,330
OUR LAWS, AND THEY REALLY DO. 

881
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,665
THEY UPHOLD OUR LAWS AND DEFEND 

882
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,465
OUR COMMUNITIES, LIKE NOBODY 

883
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,833
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. 

884
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,536
AND, YES, THEY ARE TOUGH, THEY 

885
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:51,742
ARE STRONG, THEY ARE SMART. 

886
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:52,643
THEY HAVE GREAT HEART. 

887
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,477
THEY GO INTO THESE COMMUNITIES 

888
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,779
LOADED UP WITH THE KIND OF 

889
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,314
CRIMINALS YOU DON'T WANT TO BE 

890
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:56,647
DEALING WITH. 

891
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:57,715
THEY WALK IN LIKE IT IS ANOTHER 

892
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,716
DAY IN THE OFFICE. 

893
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,950
THEY ARE TOUGHER, THEY ARE 

894
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,918
STRONGER. 

895
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,687
IT IS WHAT THESE OTHER PEOPLE 

896
00:37:03,687 --> 00:37:04,221
FEAR. 

897
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:10,928
BY THE WAY, OUR I.C.E. 

898
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,029
FOLKS AND BORDER PATROL FOLKS, 

899
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,364
THEY HAVE NO FEAR. 

900
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,199
THE JOB THEY DO IS INCREDIBLE. 

901
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:21,872
EITHER WAY, WHY -- BY THE WAY, 

902
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:27,578
WHILE WE ARE AT IT, OUR LAW 

903
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:27,978
ENFORCEMENT. 

904
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:28,813
THESE ARE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE 

905
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:34,285
AND THEY ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. 

906
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,186
EVERY SINGLE DAY, I.C.E. 

907
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,921
IS TRACKING DOWN DRUG DEALERS, 

908
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,724
PREDATORS AND KILLERS, AND WE 

909
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:43,928
ARE EITHER THROWING THEM IN JAIL

910
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,662
OR THROWING THEM OUT OF OUR 

911
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:48,532
COUNTRY. 

912
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:53,971
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE I.C.E., IF 

913
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:54,972
YOU WANT TO PROTECT OUR BORDER 

914
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:58,943
AND OUR BORDER PATROL, IF YOU 

915
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,444
WANT TO STOP THIS CRAZINESS OF 

916
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,313
SANCTUARY CITIES, WHERE 

917
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,814
CRIMINALS ARE PROTECTED, TAKE A 

918
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:07,184
LOOK AT CHICAGO. 

919
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,419
HOW ABOUT THE MAYOR OF CHICAGO? 

920
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:13,391
IT IS LIKE A WAR ZONE. 

921
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,425
IT IS A GREAT CITY. 

922
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,726
IT IS LIKE A WAR ZONE. 

923
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,962
THIS IS WHAT THOSE POLICIES DO. 

924
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,196
LAST WEEK, 62 PEOPLE WERE SHOT 

925
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:22,533
AND 12 DIED. 

926
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,267
THIS IS OUR COUNTRY. 

927
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:26,070
THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS. 

928
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,670
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STANDS 

929
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,507
PROUDLY WITH OUR COURAGEOUS 

930
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:29,740
I.C.E. 

931
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,807
OFFICERS AND BORDER PATROL 

932
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:36,447
AGENTS. 

933
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:40,751
AND BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW WHO 

934
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,520
WANTS THE WALL MORE THAN ANY OF 

935
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:42,686
US? 

936
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:43,487
I.C.E. 

937
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:48,426
AND BORDER PATROL, BECAUSE THEY 

938
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,860
KNOW THAT IS GOING TO BE A BIG, 

939
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,861
BIG FACTOR IN STOPPING THE 

940
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:54,632
DRUGS FROM COMING IN. 

941
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:55,566
THE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS, WHICH IS 

942
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:59,904
WORSE ALL OVER THE WORLD, THEN 

943
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,305
AT ANY TIME IN THE HISTORY OF 

944
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,173
OUR WORLD. 

945
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,073
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. 

946
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:03,974
WHO WOULD BELIEVE, IT IS 

947
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:08,045
BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET. 

948
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:08,979
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT SECURITY 

949
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,648
AND THIS ELECTION IS ALSO ABOUT 

950
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:11,515
JOBS. 

951
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,416
WE HAVE PRODUCED. 

952
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:15,853
WE HAVE PRODUCED. 

953
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,520
THANKS TO REPUBLICANS, OUR 

954
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:22,159
ECONOMY IS BOOMING, LIKE IT HAS 

955
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:22,793
NEVER BOOMED BEFORE. 

956
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:23,894
WE HAVE CREATED ANOTHER NUMBER 

957
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:24,695
THAT NOBODY WOULD HAVE 

958
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,397
BELIEVED, IF I SAID IT DURING 

959
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:30,501
THE CAMPAIGN. 

960
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:31,602
4 MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE THE 

961
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:31,868
ELECTION. 

962
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:35,339
NOBODY WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT. 

963
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:40,744
ALMOST 3.9 MILLION AMERICANS 

964
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:42,112
HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF FOOD 

965
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:44,114
STAMPS. 

966
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:44,915
THINK OF THAT. 

967
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,585
THEY DON'T NEED THEM, BECAUSE 

968
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:51,522
THEY HAVE A JOB. 

969
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,456
THEY ARE EATING BETTER, NOW. 

970
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:56,193
THEY DON'T NEED FOOD STAMPS. 

971
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,428
ALMOST 4 MILLION, THINK OF IT. 

972
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:03,000
LAST YEAR IN WEST VIRGINIA, PER 

973
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,201
CAPITA INCOME GREW 40% FASTER 

974
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,335
THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. 

975
00:40:05,335 --> 00:40:07,137
40%, CONGRATULATIONS. 

976
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:12,510
I TOLD YOU, LAST TIME I WAS 

977
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,777
HERE, YOU WEREN'T SO HAPPY LIKE 

978
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:16,413
YOU ARE NOW. 

979
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:17,982
WE HAVE ADDED OVER 400,000 NEW 

980
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,284
MANUFACTURING JOBS NATIONWIDE. 

981
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,619
THAT NUMBER IS SOON GOING TO 

982
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:30,427
EXCEED 600,000. 

983
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:31,428
AND OUR OPPONENTS SAID, THERE'S 

984
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:32,262
NO SUCH THING AS MANUFACTURING 

985
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:32,963
JOBS ANYMORE, RIGHT? 

986
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,465
AND I SAID, I SEE, WERE NOT 

987
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,966
GOING TO MAKE THINGS ANYMORE. 

988
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,935
THINK OF IT. 

989
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,169
WE WILL BE CLOSE TO 600,000, 

990
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:40,070
VERY SOON. 

991
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,606
WE HAVE COMPANIES POURING INTO 

992
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:42,939
OUR COUNTRY. 

993
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:46,477
THESE ARE COMPANIES WHO LEFT. 

994
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,578
THEY ARE COMING BACK TO 

995
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:47,844
MICHIGAN. 

996
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:49,213
THEY ARE COMING BACK TO WEST 

997
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,013
VIRGINIA. 

998
00:40:50,013 --> 00:40:50,848
THEY ARE COMING BACK TO 

999
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:51,549
PENNSYLVANIA AND OHIO. 

1000
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:55,419
THEY ARE COMING TO FLORIDA. 

1001
00:40:55,419 --> 00:41:06,597
THEY ARE COMING BACK, NOT JUST 

1002
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:07,331
OPENING, THEY ARE COMING BACK. 

1003
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,532
THEY LEFT AND NOW THEY ARE 

1004
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:09,633
COMING BACK, BECAUSE THEY WANT 

1005
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,935
TO BE WHERE THE ACTION IS AND 

1006
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,069
THE ACTION IS IN THE UNITED 

1007
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,773
STATES OF AMERICA. 

1008
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,308
SO, THE ECONOMIC GROWTH, AS I 

1009
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,978
SAID, WHEN IT HIT 4.1%, EVERYONE

1010
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,212
WAS LIKE THAT IS AMAZING, 

1011
00:41:22,212 --> 00:41:22,512
EXCEPT ME. 

1012
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:23,647
IT WILL GO MUCH HIGHER. 

1013
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,115
WHEN I FINISHED THESE TRADE 

1014
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:28,719
DEALS, AND THE TARIFFS ARE VERY 

1015
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,987
IMPORTANT, THESE COMPANIES COME 

1016
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,190
IN AND I SAY TO THE EUROPEAN 

1017
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,362
UNION, VERY NICE PEOPLE, I SAY, 

1018
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,496
WE WOULD LIKE TO NEGOTIATE A 

1019
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:41,031
NEW TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE 

1020
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,767
EUROPEAN UNION. 

1021
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,169
WE LOST $151 BILLION OVER THE 

1022
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,337
LAST NUMBER OF YEARS, PER YEAR. 

1023
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:51,875
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT 151 

1024
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:52,676
BILLION PER YEAR IS? 

1025
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,977
HE PROMPTLY SAID, MISTER 

1026
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:56,146
PRESIDENT, BUT WE ARE VERY 

1027
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:56,947
HAPPY WITH THE DEAL. 

1028
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,749
I SAID, I WOULD BE HAPPY WITH 

1029
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:04,655
THE DEAL, IF I WERE YOU, TOO. 

1030
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:05,889
I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY. 

1031
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:07,224
I SAID A SECOND TIME, A THIRD 

1032
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,125
TIME AND A FOURTH TIME. 

1033
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,360
THEY WERE HAPPY WITH THE DEAL. 

1034
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,060
WE WEREN'T HAPPY. 

1035
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,061
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BARRIERS UP 

1036
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,197
AND THEY HAVE TARIFFS. 

1037
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,965
YOU WANT TO BUILD A CAR AND 

1038
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:20,070
SEND IT TO EUROPE. 

1039
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,105
HOW MANY CHEVROLETS ARE THERE 

1040
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,006
IN THE MIDDLE OF BERLIN? 

1041
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,073
NOT TOO MANY. 

1042
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:26,810
MAYBE ONE. 

1043
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,411
I DOUBT IT. 

1044
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:28,846
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN FIND ONE. 

1045
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:29,647
SO THEY HAVE BARRIERS. 

1046
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:30,881
I SAID, COME ON, LET'S GO. 

1047
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,215
I SAID THIS TO NUMEROUS 

1048
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:36,553
COUNTRIES. 

1049
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:37,888
LISTEN, THIS IS WHAT WE ARE 

1050
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,389
GOING TO DO. 

1051
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:45,696
IT IS ALL ABOUT THE CARS. 

1052
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,331
WE ARE GOING TO PUT A $.25 TAX 

1053
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,432
ON EVERY CAR THAT COMES FROM 

1054
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:52,169
THE EUROPEAN UNION INTO THE U.S.

1055
00:42:52,169 --> 00:43:00,511
AND THAT WILL TAKE OUR LOSS AND 

1056
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:01,445
TRADE DEFICIT OF $151 BILLION 

1057
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:02,780
AND IT WILL GIVE US A SURPLUS 

1058
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,784
OF $151 BILLION. 

1059
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:10,287
THAT IS A FAIRLY DRAMATIC SWING 

1060
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:13,323
AND THAT WILL TAKE ONE LITTLE 

1061
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:48,892
SIGNATURE, DONALD J. TRUMP.

1062
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:49,927
>>> WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. 

1063
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,128
I USED TO TALK ABOUT THIS. 

1064
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,862
I DID NOT PRESS IT INITIALLY 

1065
00:43:52,862 --> 00:43:55,833
BECAUSE I WANTED THEM TO HELP 

1066
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,034
US WITH NORTH KOREA AND THEY 

1067
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,002
HAD AND WE ARE DOING WELL WITH 

1068
00:43:59,002 --> 00:44:01,638
NORTH KOREA. 

1069
00:44:01,638 --> 00:44:02,706
THEY SAY WHAT'S HAPPENING, HEY 

1070
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:03,674
FOLKS, THEY HAVE BEEN DOING 

1071
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,075
THIS FOR 75 YEARS. 

1072
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:05,743
WHAT HAPPENED? 

1073
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:10,614
I CAN TELL YOU, AND I GOT ALONG 

1074
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:13,417
VERY WELL WITH KIM. 

1075
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:17,121
REALLY WELL. 

1076
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:30,901
THERE'S BEEN NO -- 

1077
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:39,910
>> WE ARE GETTING THINGS GOING. 

1078
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:54,925
PAYING $1.8 MILLION IN CASH. 

1079
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:56,326
AND THEY SAY WHAT IS TAKING SO 

1080
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:56,559
LONG? 

1081
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:58,461
I SAID, FOR 40 OR 60 YEARS, 

1082
00:44:58,461 --> 00:45:03,634
DOING -- DURING THE NUCLEAR AGE 

1083
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:04,233
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING. 

1084
00:45:04,233 --> 00:45:05,269
NO ONE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE 

1085
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,270
FACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS 

1086
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,671
UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING WITH 

1087
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:12,576
NORTH KOREA AND CONSIDERED THIS 

1088
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:13,811
LIKE JUST, READ THE PAPERS YOU 

1089
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,446
WILL SEE WHAT HE SAID SO I'VE 

1090
00:45:16,446 --> 00:45:17,881
BEEN REALLY HONEST AND WHO 

1091
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:23,720
KNOWS, I HAVE BEEN TAKING OFF 

1092
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,988
THESE SANCTIONS BUT THEY HAVE 

1093
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:28,024
TO GET READY TO BE RID OF THE 

1094
00:45:28,024 --> 00:45:29,827
NUKES. 

1095
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:37,768
THEY HAVE TO GET RID OF THEM 

1096
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:38,969
BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN. 

1097
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,370
MAYBE IT WILL WORK OUT BUT I 

1098
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,805
THINK THAT WE HAVE DONE A GOOD 

1099
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,240
JOB IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 

1100
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,041
REMEMBER THEY WERE EXTREMELY 

1101
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,275
HOSTILE AND SAID THAT I WAS 

1102
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:51,381
GOING TO GET THEM INTO A WAR. 

1103
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:52,382
THEY THOUGHT MY RHETORIC WAS 

1104
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:52,816
TOO STRONG. 

1105
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:54,218
I DON'T WANT TO SAY BECAUSE I 

1106
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,252
DON'T WANT TO INSULT CHAIRMAN 

1107
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:55,986
KIM. 

1108
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,020
YOU REMEMBER. 

1109
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:03,560
ELTON JOHN, I DON'T WANT TO 

1110
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,329
INSULT HIM SO I WON'T MENTION 

1111
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:08,398
IT BUT, THE FAKE NEWS BACK 

1112
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:12,703
THERE SAID HE IS GOING TO GET 

1113
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:19,409
US INTO A WAR. HE IS CRAZY. 

1114
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,611
THIS GUY, HE IS CRAZY, OUR 

1115
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:26,950
PRESIDENT IS CRAZY. 

1116
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:34,591
AND THEN I WENT TO MEET 

1117
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,459
EVERYONE THAT RUNS NATO, THE 

1118
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:40,130
LEADERS OF NATO AND THEY 

1119
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:40,931
WEREN'T PAYING THEIR BILLS, 

1120
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:44,201
THEY WERE DELINQUENT. 

1121
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,169
AND IN REAL ESTATE, I LOVE REAL 

1122
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:51,508
ESTATE, WHEN YOU DON'T PAY YOUR 

1123
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:52,309
RENT YOU ARE DELINQUENT. 

1124
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,779
AND I MET THEM LAST YEAR. 

1125
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:57,147
THE SECRETARY GENERAL, THE 

1126
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:04,488
GREAT GUY, -- A GREAT GUY. HE 

1127
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,923
WAS IN CHARGE OF NATO BUT HE 

1128
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,724
COULD NOT GET ANY MONEY BUT 

1129
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:13,430
LAST YEAR I WENT A YEAR AGO AND 

1130
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,464
SAID, YOU AREN'T PAYING YOUR 

1131
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:15,666
BILLS, YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR 

1132
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:15,899
BILLS. 

1133
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:16,900
HE PICKED UP $44 BILLION. 

1134
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,936
BUT THEY DID NOT REPRESS THAT 

1135
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:26,643
MIKE REPORT THAT TO THE PRESS 

1136
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:27,878
-- REPORT THAT TO THE PRESS. 

1137
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,279
WE ARE GOING TO PICK UP AT 

1138
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,948
LEAST ANOTHER CLOSE TO $100 

1139
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,950
BILLION EXTRA. I SAID, YOU HAVE 

1140
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:33,750
TO PAY YOUR BILLS. 

1141
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,786
THE UNITED STATES IS PAYING 

1142
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:42,492
CLOSE TO 90% OF THE COST FOR 

1143
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:43,493
PROTECTING EUROPE WHICH I THINK 

1144
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:50,200
IS WONDERFUL AND I SAID, FOLKS 

1145
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,635
NATO IS BETTER FOR YOU THAN IT 

1146
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:52,235
IS FOR US. 

1147
00:47:52,235 --> 00:47:52,636
BELIEVE ME. 

1148
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:53,837
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THEY 

1149
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:55,872
ASKED THE QUESTION, THEY HAVE 

1150
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:56,673
SMALL COUNTRIES, BIG COUNTRIES, 

1151
00:47:56,673 --> 00:48:01,979
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT 

1152
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:02,179
THEM. 

1153
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,213
THEY SAID LOOK, IT'S SIMPLE, 

1154
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:03,613
PAY UP. 

1155
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:04,247
PAY YOUR BILLS. 

1156
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:06,016
AND SOMEONE SAID SIR, THERE'S A 

1157
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:09,119
PRESIDENT OF A COUNTRY SHOWING 

1158
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,356
ME RESPECT, I SAID YES MISTER 

1159
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,924
PRESIDENT HE SAID, WOULD YOU 

1160
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,626
LEAVE US IF WE DON'T PAY OUR 

1161
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:18,028
BILLS? 

1162
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:24,635
AND THEY DID NOT LIKE MY ANSWER.

1163
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,369
AND I SAID YES I WOULD HAVE TO 

1164
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:26,736
CONSIDER THIS. 

1165
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:27,937
YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR BILLS. 

1166
00:48:27,937 --> 00:48:37,314
THEY HATED THAT ANSWER. 

1167
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:38,949
BUT IF I SAID NO, I WON'T LEAVE 

1168
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,584
YOU AND YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY 

1169
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,785
YOUR BILLS, I PROMISE WE WILL 

1170
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:43,020
ALWAYS PROTECT YOU AND YOU WILL 

1171
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,021
ALWAYS BE PROTECTED DON'T PAY 

1172
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,055
YOUR BILLS, THEN THEY WON'T 

1173
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,856
EVER PAY THEIR BILLS. 

1174
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:48,058
SO I SAID, YES I WILL LEAVE IF 

1175
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:53,163
YOU DON'T PAY YOUR BILLS. 

1176
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,398
AND YOU COULD SEE THOSE CHECKS 

1177
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,399
COMING OUT FOR BILLIONS OF 

1178
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,433
DOLLARS SO THEY PAID THEIR 

1179
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,834
BILLS AND I THINK WE WILL PICK 

1180
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,069
UP OVER THE NEXT SHORT WHILE. 

1181
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,237
OVER $100 BILLION. 

1182
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,039
AND THEN THEY SAID, THE FAKE 

1183
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,774
NEWS SAID, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

1184
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:12,315
TREATED THE NATO NATION LEADERS

1185
00:49:12,315 --> 00:49:13,683
, I PUT THIS IN BRACKETS, WHO 

1186
00:49:13,683 --> 00:49:16,119
HAVE BEEN RIPPING US OFF. 

1187
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:21,024
TREATED THE NATO LEADERS WITH 

1188
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,024
TREMENDOUS CONTEMPT AND 

1189
00:49:22,024 --> 00:49:28,298
DISRESPECT. 

1190
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,132
AND I SAID, NO. 

1191
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:29,966
THEY DISRESPECTED OUR COUNTRY 

1192
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,368
BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT PAY. 

1193
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,905
NOW THEY ARE PAYING. 

1194
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:39,709
HOW ABOUT IF WE GOT INTO A 

1195
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:41,944
CONFLICT BECAUSE A COUNTRY WAS 

1196
00:49:41,944 --> 00:49:51,655
ATTACKED AND NOW WE ARE IN 

1197
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,289
WORLD WAR III? 

1198
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,290
WE ARE PROTECTING A COUNTRY 

1199
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,324
THAT WAS ATTACKED AND DIDN'T 

1200
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,159
PAY ITS BILLS I WOULD FEEL SO 

1201
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:56,392
STUPID. 

1202
00:49:56,392 --> 00:49:57,394
WE ARE PROTECTING A COUNTRY 

1203
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:58,562
THAT WAS NOT PAYING ITS BILLS 

1204
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,497
SO I GOT THEM TO PAY $100 

1205
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:05,102
BILLION. 

1206
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,303
IT COULDN'T BE MUCH MORE THAN 

1207
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,503
THAT BUT IT WAS A TREMENDOUS 

1208
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:08,105
AMOUNT OF MONEY. 

1209
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:16,680
NOW THEY ARE PAYING NOW. 

1210
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,714
THEN THEY MADE THE STATEMENT 

1211
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:18,682
THAT I SHOWED GREAT DISRESPECT 

1212
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,916
BUT ACTUALLY, I HAVE A GREAT 

1213
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:20,917
RELATIONSHIP WITH ALL OF THOSE 

1214
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:21,150
PEOPLE. 

1215
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:21,517
28 PEOPLE. 

1216
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:22,152
ALL OF THEM. 

1217
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,153
BECAUSE NOW THEY RESPECT US. 

1218
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,187
THEY RESPECT OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. 

1219
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,621
THEY DID NOT RESPECT OUR 

1220
00:50:25,621 --> 00:50:31,495
COUNTRY. 

1221
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:32,729
BUT THEY RESPECT US AGAIN AND 

1222
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:35,298
YOU SEE THIS WITH CHINA. CHINA 

1223
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,801
WAS WALKING THEIR WAY DOWN THAT 

1224
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:43,840
NOW THEY ARE MARKING THEIR WAY 

1225
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,509
DOWN TO 30% BUT I WANT THEM TO 

1226
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:47,144
DO WELL AND I WANT TO BE THEIR 

1227
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:52,415
FRIEND BUT WE HAD TO DO'S -- WE 

1228
00:50:52,415 --> 00:50:54,050
HAD TO DO THINGS WE HAD TO DO. 

1229
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,285
WE WERE GOING INTO A CERTAIN 

1230
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,086
DIRECTION THAT WOULD ALLOW 

1231
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,087
DIRECTIONS -- CHINA TO BE 

1232
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,288
BIGGER THAN US IN A SHORT 

1233
00:50:58,288 --> 00:50:59,523
AMOUNT OF TIME. 

1234
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,224
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 

1235
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:06,229
ANYMORE. 

1236
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:17,174
THE LONG WINDING ROAD, YOU 

1237
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:17,374
KNOW? 

1238
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,408
I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR 

1239
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:18,642
CHINA. 

1240
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:19,843
THE ENERGY, THE GENIUS, IT IS 

1241
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:20,843
INCREDIBLE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE 

1242
00:51:20,843 --> 00:51:22,078
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE A 

1243
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,079
GREAT RELATIONSHIP THAT IT HAS 

1244
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,916
TO BE A TWO-WAY STREET. 

1245
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,184
WE HAVE TO HAVE A TWO-WAY 

1246
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:27,751
STREET WITH EVERYONE. 

1247
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,418
OUR ENEMIES AND OUR FRIENDS AND 

1248
00:51:29,418 --> 00:51:31,421
ALLIES, OUR ALLIES TREAT US 

1249
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,756
WORSE THAN OUR ENEMIES. 

1250
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:33,657
BELIEVE IT. 

1251
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:34,991
SO IT'S ALL CHANGING AND WHEN 

1252
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:36,526
WE GET THE TRADE DEALS DONE 

1253
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:49,472
PROPERLY, YOU KNOW WHAT BOTHERS 

1254
00:51:49,472 --> 00:51:49,672
ME? 

1255
00:51:49,672 --> 00:51:50,874
I HAVE PEOPLE COMING TO ME, 

1256
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:51,941
SOME PEOPLE IN CONGRESS, SIR 

1257
00:51:51,941 --> 00:51:53,143
CAN YOU GET THIS DEAL DONE 

1258
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:53,476
IMMEDIATELY? 

1259
00:51:53,476 --> 00:51:54,778
I SAID IT DOES NOT WORK THIS 

1260
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,179
WAY I DON'T WANT TO GO TOO 

1261
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:56,379
FAST. 

1262
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:57,814
WE HAVE TO TAKE TIME AND WE 

1263
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:58,415
HAVE TO GESTATE. 

1264
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,183
LIKE WHEN YOU ARE COOKING A 

1265
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:00,517
CHICKEN. 

1266
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:01,251
TIME. 

1267
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,085
TURKEY FOR THINGS GIVING. 

1268
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,086
MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, EIGHT 

1269
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:03,319
HOURS. 

1270
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:04,921
I SAID EIGHT HOURS? 

1271
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,156
SHE MADE THE GREATEST TURKEY I 

1272
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:13,663
HAVE EVER HAD, IT TAKES TIME. ú 

1273
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:14,464
>> IT TAKES TIME. 

1274
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:18,134
SO WHEN THEY RUN AND THEY SAY, 

1275
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,336
COULD YOU DO NATO RIGHT NOW? 

1276
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,304
CAN'T WE SIGN IT NEXT WEEK I 

1277
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,772
SAY LOOK, I LIKE MEXICO, I LIKE 

1278
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:25,074
THE NEW LEADER AND I THINK HE'S 

1279
00:52:25,074 --> 00:52:30,513
GOING TO BE TERRIFIC A LITTLE 

1280
00:52:30,513 --> 00:52:31,948
DIFFERENT FROM WHO WE ARE BUT I 

1281
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:33,149

1310
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,818

EVERY PRESIDENT, MANY PRESIDENTS

1671
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:51,340

1686
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:32,848
PEACE, REMEMBER I SAID, IT WAS 

1687
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:34,049
A GOOD THING TO HAVE DONE 

1688
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:35,451
BECAUSE WE TOOK IT OFF OF THE 

1689
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:35,684

AND IN THE NEGOTIATION ISRAEL 

1696
01:07:46,428 --> 01:07:47,830
WILL HAVE TO PAY A HIGHER PRICE 

1697
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:54,303
BECAUSE THEY WANTED A BIG THING 

1698
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:55,738
BUT I TOOK THIS OFF OF THE 

1699
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:56,939

NOW IT IS OFF OF THE TABLE AND 

1707
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:11,820
THERE'S NOTHING TO NEGOTIATE 

1708
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:12,821
BUT THEY WILL GET SOMETHING 

1709
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:14,023

>> Reporter: THERE IS NO DOUBT 

1888
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:39,668
ABOUT IT WEST VIRGINIA LOVES 

1889
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:41,937
DONALD TRUMP AND THE MOOD WAS 

1890
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:45,040
EXTREMELY ENERGETIC AND TO SOME 

1891
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,709
EXTENT HE WAVED TO THE AUDIENCE 

1892
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,479
AND FOR THAT REASON IT FELT 

1893
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:57,619
LIKE A MIXTURE OF TRUMP'S 

1894
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:58,787
GREATEST HITS WITH SOME OF HIS 

1895
01:15:58,787 --> 01:15:59,588
MORE RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND

01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:00,822
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE THE USUAL 

1897
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:02,991
CHANCE, -- THERE WAS THE USUAL 

1898
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:09,765
CHANTING CONDEMNING THE MEDIA 

1899
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:10,966
OR BUILDING THE WALL BUT ONE 

1900
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:12,401
THING THAT STRUCK ME IS THAT HE 

1901
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,402
DID NOT MENTION, MAYBE THE 

1902
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:14,836

1909
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:36,958

TOOK THAT MUCH TIME TO BE VERY 

1911
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:43,899

1912
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:44,900

1915
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:52,641
HIS SPEECH HERE WAS ALL OVER 

1916

OBAMA CARE,  AND SO I CAN'T PUT 

1921
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,725
MY FINGER ON EXACTLY WHAT THE 

1922
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:11,727
MESSAGE WAS TONIGHT EXCEPT 

1923
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:20,102
VOTING IN THE MIDTERM ELECTION 

1924
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:20,902
IS CRITICAL. 

1925
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:21,503
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HE 

1926
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:22,470
CONTINUED TO COME BACK TO OVER 

1927
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:23,105
AND OVER AGAIN. 

1928
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,106
>> HE VERY NOTABLY DIDN'T 

1929
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:25,073
MENTION PAUL MANAFORT OR 

1930
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:26,074
MICHAEL COHEN. 

1931
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:34,249
>> RIGHT. 

1932

>> Reporter: AFTER THE DAY WE 

1933

HAD TODAY. 

1934
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:36,885
THE BREAKING NEWS WITH THESE 

1935
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:38,120
TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE VERY CLOSE 

1936
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,321
TO HIM DURING THE CAMPAIGN IT 

1937
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,555
IS NOT SURPRISING HE DID NOT 

1938
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:43,191
BRING IT UP BUT I HAVE TO SAY 

1939
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:44,626
THE FACT THAT HE RAMPED UP THE 

1940
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:48,430
NEED FOR VOTING IN THE NOVEMBER 

1941
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,298
MIDTERMS, THAT WAS IN THE 

1942
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:53,168
BACKDROP. 

1943
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,369
I MEAN, LOOK THE FACT IS 

1944
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:58,340
DESPITE WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WITH

1945
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:02,077
THEM BEING FOUND GUILTY RATHER 

1946
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:03,311
IN THE CASE OF MANAFORT, TO 

1947
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:12,454
THESE CRIMINAL CHARGES, THERE'S 

1948
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:13,889
STILL A LOT OF GRAY AREA IN 

1949
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:15,123
TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT A 

1950
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:15,924
SITTING PRESIDENT WILL BE

01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:16,191
INDICTED.

01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,058
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER 

1953
01:18:17,058 --> 01:18:19,394
HAS INDICATED HE DOESN'T INTEND 

1954
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:20,395
TO INDICT THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE 

1955
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,029
HE IS A SITTING PRESIDENT BUT 

1956
01:18:22,029 --> 01:18:28,469
THERE ARE STILL DOORS OPEN 

1957
01:18:28,469 --> 01:18:28,703
THERE. 

1958
01:18:28,703 --> 01:18:29,538
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING 

1959

DEFINITIVE. 

1960
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:30,505
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE 

1961
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:31,906

1962
01:18:31,906 --> 01:18:34,009
CRIME. 

1963
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,210
THIS STILL BRINGS IT CLOSER TO 

1964
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,011
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND TO 

1965
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:36,845
IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS IF THE 

1966
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:39,648
DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL OF 

1967
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:46,821

1968
01:18:46,821 --> 01:18:49,624
POSSIBILITY OF THE DEMOCRATS 

1969
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:50,759
ARE BRINGING FORWARD 

1970
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,661
IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS AND IT'S 

1971
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:54,462
REAL AND THE PRESIDENT IS AWARE 

1972
01:18:54,462 --> 01:18:57,132
OF THAT AND SO PERHAPS WE SAW 

1973
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,966
SUCH AN EFFORT TODAY TO GET 

1974
01:18:58,966 --> 01:19:05,440

HE SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE 

1981
01:19:15,616 --> 01:19:17,185
BOOST THAT HIS ENDORSEMENT 

1982
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:21,089
GIVES. 

1983
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,724
IS THIS NOW GOING TO BE PART OF 

1984
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:24,158
HIS STRATEGY AHEAD OF THE

THAT ARE CAMPAIGN RALLIES FOR 

1991
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,541
HIMSELF OF COURSE BUT THE 

1992
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:40,809
HEADLINE, IT'S MEANT TO BE AN 

1993
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:41,409

1994
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:45,981
GOING INTO THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS

1995
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,315
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID MANY 

1996
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:48,750
