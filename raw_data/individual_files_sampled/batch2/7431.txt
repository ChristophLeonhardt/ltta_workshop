new documents revealed that the Trump administration decided to take millions of dollars out of FEMA funding and then redirect that money toward detaining individuals at the border so to be specific there was ten million dollars that was taken out of the FEMA budget and it would come from FEMA's operations and support budget and it was then transferred to accounts at ice to pay for detention and removal operations as we know the Trump administration continues with their extremely strict immigration policies and our preparedness for hurricanes might suffer as a result of that the Department of Homeland Security transferred money from accounts at Customs and Border Protection that pays for border fencing and technology as well so let's pause there because they brought it to ice and then they brought it for as you just saw there CBP okay it's a water fancy and technology there's another word for that it's called the wall now it's a little bit different and if you remember during the election Hillary Clinton was also for a fence and so and and a different times Trump I said I'm doing the wall it's gonna be good it's gonna be see-through maybe like a fence so mm okay that's what I thought anyway but in a sense it is for whatever you want to call it a fence or a wall at the border you know where we could really use a wall in North Carolina South Carolina and Virginia today but it ain't gonna keep out the hurricane either okay so they're taking your money against the mythical enemy right and and using it against a mythical enemy when in fact there are real huge problems that could wipe out your home your family where your family lived and if you don't move fast enough your family itself barreling towards us and they take that real problem and call it a hoax and they take a hoax and call it the real problem now if it was just demagoguery and it was just used to win elections it would be bad enough because that has consequences as well but now it's actually money they're moving money out of the right places and into the wrong places Trump said and we talked about this last night on the election coverage on The Young Turks live that he alone could protect you well it turns out he he's doing the exact opposite just in order to play political games he's not protecting your family and instead transferring money to things that are gonna do almost nothing to protect you right and also as with any political issue any policy you have to take it in the context of other policies to kind of understand the weight of what's going on because you know this isn't just an isolated story where money is being redirected from FEMA and put into you know detention efforts at the border you have to think about what Trump has been doing when it comes to environmental policy which would exacerbate the issue of climate change and further lead to more extreme weather conditions more extreme hurricane seasons then you have to keep in mind that the Trump administration pushed for and successfully passed massive tax cuts for the wealthy which will lead to less revenue for the federal government that those tax cuts are gonna cost nearly two trillion dollars over the next ten years and so all of this stuff is an incredibly dangerous cocktail and we've already seen the ramifications of that when it comes to Puerto Rico but with more extreme weather conditions it's only gonna get worse so by the way it's not just FEMA according to these documents two hundred million dollars was moved from the budgets of other agencies to Isis detention and removals so we know about this because Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon was able to get these documents and he had an interview on the Rachel Maddow Show about it so I want to toss to this video so you kind of get a sense of how serious this is ten million dollars comes out of FEMA when we're facing a hurricane season knowing what happened last year and then look what we've had since a hurricane just barely miss Hawaii a tropical storm that almost became a hurricane hit hit Mississippi and now we have this hurricane Florence bearing down on the on the Carolinas extraordinary and by the way Rachel the chart you put up is the same chart I have in my hand right here it says that money came from response and recovery right on it so I would dispute the this statement that this has no bearing on addressing the challenges from hurricanes so I want to also just quickly give you that statement that Senator Merkley referenced at the end of that quote he said the DHS Department of Homeland Security released a statement on Twitter and it goes as follows under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from FEMA to immigration enforcement efforts this is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster that is a flat-out lie the documents 100% indicate that the ten million dollars nearly ten million dollars was taken out of the FEMA budget specifically the FEMA's operations and support budget and then redirected to these immigration efforts in fact instantly after putting out that lie the agency according to New York Times in an email said that funds taken from FEMA's accounts amounted to less than 1% of the agency's operational accounts ok so you did take it out of the operational accounts so when you said you didn't take it out of there that was nothing but a lie and does this administration have any credibility left at all no and do they think through any of their lives before they say them so lie number one is no such thing it's outrageous how could they possibly say that line number two is it's just a small thing anyway I mean it was taken out of the operational Council that first thing we said was total total total lie an obvious brazen ridiculous lie which we're now saying is yeah but we only took out a little bit okay all right now at least we're clear on how on who to believe in who not to believe murkly by the way if you don't know him is one of the best progressives in the Senate and this is exactly the type of thing that we why we have separation of powers of whining we need the three branches so the legislative checks the executive and says wait a minute do you have the right priorities and if Merkley releases that document and the country goes oh yeah that's great man that's wonderful we really need to build that fence and to build more detention camps that's what the country needs our families being protected from hurricanes who cares the Trump administration did according to himself an unbelievably great job of protecting people in Puerto Rico even though nearly 3,000 people died if that's such a great job when if 3,000 people die in the Carolinas will he also call that a success an unsung success will he cook and so any the country's comfortable with that like hey 3,000 people dying in a hurricane but at least we got detention camps then you would say okay I'm glad it was the legislative branch showed that and and we applauded if you don't like that then I'm glad you know we live in a democracy then you should do something about it I do want to also touch on Trump's reaction to the nearly 3,000 deaths in Puerto Rico and also FEMA's honesty in their report following some of these results in Puerto Rico so first as we had talked about yesterday Trump believes that the disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico were an unsung success I'm sure he got heat for that because it was a ridiculous statement to say but he doubled down Don he decided to double down on it today and he said via Twitter we got a pluses for our recent hurricane work in Texas and Florida and did an unappreciated job great job in Puerto Rico even though an inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent mayor of San Juan he's unbelievable nearly 3,000 people died we are ready for the big one that is coming so that's what Trump said now what did FEMA say because they did release a report you know after they analyzed the efforts there and an after-action report by FEMA released in July shows that the agency vastly underestimated how much food and fresh water it would need and how hard it would be to get additional supplies to the island the report also describes the initial response as chaotic and disorganized and plagued with logistical problems as the agency tried to get food and other equipment onto the island I felt like having my job now is breaking down the stupidity of Donald Trump explaining all the things that are wrong with it it turns out the island was inaccessible as he is previously said literally it was surrounded by water big water ocean waters this is an island surrounded by water big water ocean water okay yeah as the president you're supposed to foresee that an island might be surrounded by water and then it might be hard to get to and you're supposed to plan for that nobody could have known that an island was surrounded by water we didn't so we didn't know that it was big water in hurricanes and it was very wet and in fact that's another quote from yesterday when he said that the hurricane is coming to the Carolinas and that it is going to be tremendously wet it's tremendously big and tremendously wet oh come on guys your Trump boater you still proud you're still proud you think that guy is smart guy who says that water is tremendously wet and and a guy who says well I mean I on island wasn't accessible everybody gave us a pluses he said for Texas and Florida if Obama had said that one I'd be mortified and two I'd come out here and and laugh and criticize him etc why I got eight year track record of doing that when Obama did something wrong we pointed out like I mean it's humiliating to have somebody on your own side be such a fricking doofus Oh Julie if Obama came out on anything you do I've got an A+ on that you know what another thing I did also an a-plus everything they do is an a-plus I'm like oh my god I'm so sorry I ever voted for what a buffoon who talks like that what moron goes around saying are the things that I did all the disasters that I handled where thousands of people died I got a pluses but oh my god get me out of this room you're proud of that your Trump boater you're proud of that what an unbelievable idiot you live in the Carolinas originate you really think that he prepared look at the fishing rods the fish rots from the head down scrum uchi is cheapest that for 13 and a half seconds said that quote and he's the rotting fish at the head of this administration they don't plant for anything their only plan is afterwards we'll lie about it and we'll cover up it'll be fine so already a hundreds of thousands of people have evacuate to protect themselves from the hurricane that's coming if you haven't evacuated please do it please don't don't take any chances don't risk it and don't rely on Trump's words because I don't trust him I don't trust that he's prepared he's completely oblivious he's delusional he's done a horrible job when it comes to Puerto Rico he did a good job FEMA did a great job when it came to Texas and Florida but there's no guarantee that that will happen this time around especially when you see how the funds have been diverted so guys if you live in the area that's gonna get hit by the hurricane understand that his backup plan is he's just gonna call your local government officials incompetent and be done with it is your Ovaltine competent mayor who criticized me how does she right so he's gonna blame your mayor he's gonna blame your governor that's his that's not his back-up plan actually that's his plan a don't do homework because it's annoying and hard what people's lives are on the line yes Bob Woodward warned my god what happens if we go into a crisis and he's the one that has to make decisions I got news for you this is a crisis we've had a lot of crises certainly every giant hurricane that hits us over and over again is a crisis and we have a president who doesn't like to do homework doesn't like to prepare is monumentally stupid and so afterwards his plan is that's ok I'll go show you thought your thoughts yeah you're stupid not me unlike a smart person that's his plan get out of there man get out of there and don't listen
