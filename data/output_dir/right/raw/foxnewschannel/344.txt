190
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:34,475
SONS.

191
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:35,442
GREG: MOST OF THOSE CALLS ARE

192
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:35,876
RUN NUMBERS.

193
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:47,655
[LAUGHTER]

194
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:48,722
GREG: THE NUMBERS ARE CLOSE TO A

195
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:49,490
FAST FOOD RESTAURANT IN THE

196
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:49,924
NEIGHBORHOOD.

197
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:50,357
[LAUGHTER]

198
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:51,192
>> BUT THEY ALL CALL IN.

199
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:52,626
GREG: CAP, THE LESSON FOR ME AND

200
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:53,761
YOU CAN AGREE OR DISAGREE OR I

201
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:57,064
PREFER YOU TO AGREE BUT IS

202
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:57,798
TYRANNY ABOUT THE LOUD OF YOU

203
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:58,465
WHO SEEK TO INTIMIDATE THE

204
00:06:58,466 --> 00:06:59,633
AMERICAN PUBLIC AND THAT THE

205
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:00,367
ULTIMATE GOAL AND THAT'S HOW I

206
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:03,504
FEEL AND HOW YOU FEEL?

207
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:07,942
KAT: I THINK THAT'S A THING.

208
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:09,743
[LAUGHTER]

209
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:11,312
, I THINK IT WAS TOUGH AND I WAS

210
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:12,046
WATCHING THIS AND THINKING TO

211
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:14,515
MYSELF I AM SO GLAD THAT I AM

212
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:17,384
NOT A SENATOR.

213
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:20,855
I HAD THE HARDEST TIME TODAY

214
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,823
DECIDING WHETHER I WANTED

215
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:25,626
CHICKEN OR BEEF ON MY BBQ BOWL

216
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:27,962
AND THAT IS SLIGHTLY LESS

217
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:32,266
CONFIDENTIAL ON THE SIDING

218
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:33,367
SHOULD SIT ON THE HIGHEST COURT

219
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:34,001
IN THE LAND.

220
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:34,535
GREG: RIGHT, RIGHT.

221
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:37,238
KAT: BUT AS ALLUDED TO EARLIER,

222
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:47,248
WE HAVE MICHAEL AVE AND ATT I TO

223
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:47,781
THINK FOR THIS.

224
00:07:47,782 --> 00:07:48,782
WE BROUGHT UP THE INCREDIBLE

225
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:49,583
GANG RAPE ALLEGATIONS STORIES

226
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:50,317
AND MADE PEOPLE TUNE OUT AND

227
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:57,191
WATCHING DOCTOR FOR TESTIMONY

228
00:07:57,192 --> 00:07:57,858
WAS AN EMOTIONAL THING AND I

229
00:07:57,859 --> 00:07:58,692
WATCH THAT AND I HAD A TOUGH

230
00:07:58,693 --> 00:07:59,460
TIME DECIDING WHO TO BELIEVE AND

231
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:00,194
I THINK THEY BROUGHT OUT THE

232
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:02,029
GANG RAPE STUFF LISTENING TO ALL

233
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,796
THAT AND THEY WERE MORE WILLING

234
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:03,530
TO BELIEVE BRETT KAVANAUGH SO I

235
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:04,231
DON'T KNOW IF THE WHITE HOUSE

236
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:06,834
SENT HIM A THANK YOU CARD OR AN

237
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:08,269
EDIBLE ARRANGEMENT.

238
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,841
GREG: MICHAEL AVENATTI EXCITED

239
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:16,510
MORE REPUBLICANS THAN FOX NEWS.

240
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:19,280
>> I AGREE WITH THAT.

241
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:19,647
[LAUGHTER]

242
00:08:19,648 --> 00:08:20,414
GREG: I THOUGHT THAT WAS FUNNIER

243
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:21,916
IN MY HEAD.

244
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:24,551
TYRUS -- MAC.

245
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:29,723
GREG: NO PITY APPLAUSE.

246
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:30,424
TYRUS, IT'S AMAZING HOW THIS

247
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:31,492
TRAVESTY LOOKS WHEN YOU LOOK --

248
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:32,293
TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN YOU'RE INSIDE

249
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:36,297
OF IT IT SEEMS SO HORRIBLE AND

250
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,666
UGLY NOW WHEN YOU STEP OUT IT

251
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,034
SEEMS LIKE DID THAT REALLY

252
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:41,968
HAPPEN?

253
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,770
TYRUS: I DID MY BEST NOT TO GET

254
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:49,910
IN IT.

255
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:50,711
WHEN IT COMES TO JUDGES IN SOUTH

256
00:08:50,712 --> 00:08:51,612
BY TEN DO NOT WANT TO BE AROUND

257
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:51,879
IT.

258
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,680
I DON'T HAVE GREAT EXPENSES WITH

259
00:08:52,681 --> 00:08:53,781
JUDGES IN GENERAL I TRY TO AVOID

260
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:54,348
THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE.

261
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:55,749
BUT TO GO BACK, MICHAEL AVENATTI

262
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,018
I KNOW WERE LAUGHING ABOUT IT

263
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,387
BUT HE CONCERNS ME BECAUSE HE

264
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:03,757
WAS USING FEAR AND CRAZY

265
00:09:03,758 --> 00:09:06,927
ALLEGATIONS TO RUIN SOME OF LIFE

266
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,228
AND MOVE HIMSELF AHEAD AND WHEN

267
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:11,966
THERE HAS TO BE SOME TYPE OF

268
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:14,134
LEGAL FOR SOMEONE TO COME OUT

269
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:17,404
AND DO WHAT HE DID AND THEN HE

270
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:19,940
CAN REGROUP AND DO IT AGAIN.

271
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:24,144
GREG: THAT'S THE THING.

272
00:09:24,145 --> 00:09:24,912
THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION IS

273
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:25,679
TALKING ABOUT HOW CONCERNED THEY

274
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,716
ARE OVER KAVANAUGH AND THEY NOT

275
00:09:28,717 --> 00:09:29,383
SAID ANYTHING ABOUT MICHAEL

276
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:29,750
AVENATTI.

277
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:32,920
HE SHOULD BE DISBARRED.

278
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:33,654
TYRUS: HE IS USING PEOPLE TO

279
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:34,154
ADVANCE HIMSELF.

280
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:35,255
EVEN STORMY DANIELS, LISTEN,

281
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:39,960
SHE'S HAD A ROUGH LIFE.

282
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,462
[LAUGHTER]

283
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:42,196
BUT I DON'T THINK IF YOU LOOK

284
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:42,963
WHEN HISTORY LOOKS BACK, HE EVER

285
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:44,898
SERVED HER WELL.

286
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,769
SHE HAD TO PAY THE MONEY BACK.

287
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,536
KAT: THE WHITE HOUSE SENT THE

288
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:53,440
MONEY BACK.

289
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:54,208
TYRUS: NO ONE WILL WANT TO BUY

290
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,044
HER STORY AND SO HERE HIT HER

291
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:57,511
WITH A BAD BILL.

292
00:09:57,512 --> 00:10:00,247
HE DOES NOT HELP ANYONE.

293
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:00,981
MAYBE HE'S A SECRET AGENT FOR

294
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:03,450
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

295
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,184
GREG: HE DID MORE HELP OTHER

296
00:10:04,185 --> 00:00:00,000
PLUG-INS THEN SURPRISE
