all right let's get to another layer of the story Republican leaders on the Senate Intel committee say they agree with US intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and that Moscow favored Donald Trump in the race Committee Chairman Richard Burr Republicans said in a statement yesterday he saw no reason to dispute the conclusions made by the intelligence community senator Byrd's statement is at odds with Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee who do not support the conclusion that Russia sought to help Trump win last month the house Intel committee released a report absolving the Trump campaign of aiding in Russia's election interference describing contacts between Trump associates and Russians as ill-advised meetings President Trump was quick to claim vindication when the house Intel report came out labeling the Russia probe a total witch hunt and calling for an end to the investigation so highly praised bill as you watched this on the hill how are they accounting for the discrepancies between the two reports obviously Devin Nunez who heads the House Intel committee has been a defender publicly and privately a president Trump Senator Richard burr not quite as much this is likely to be the first of several embarrassing revelations for newness and the House Intelligence Committee because at the time they shuttered their investigation there were outside groups such as the Center for American Progress is Moscow project which looked at the gaping holes in that investigation up to 80% the witnesses not even talked to or brought back for questioning a lot of witnesses who came before that committee panel were allowed to invoke privileges that it was unclear they even have to not answer questions so their conclusion that they saw no evidence of collusion largely stemmed from the fact that critics say they didn't really look they didn't really look too hard so as this investigation continues unabated on the Senate side we're seeing now the release for instance about the information about the Trump Tower meeting there will be additional revelations as the Senate Intelligence Committee continues a thorough investigation including you know releases more information and the beginning here for since that the whole premise of this Trump Tower Moscow meeting as you talked about earlier was in fact to get dirt on Hillary Clinton is now confirmed by those documents they'll be more to come Mike Richard you know it's quite easy for all of us in the news business to get carried away with the focus on Donald J Trump in everything that happens to him every day multiple times a day but Russia Russia is a huge story today in this world I would think I would I would hope that you would address that I mean given their role in the Middle East given their role their growing role in world order in interfering not just in our domestic politics but allegedly in other countries why where is Russia headed Russia's has emerged in some ways it's the great outlier it is the great opponent what we used to call the liberal world order and what's so interesting about it is how little Russia has to play with and the returns they get this is a essentially a poor country with the shrinking population about 140 243 million people no economy to speak of other than they produce oil and gas well look what they've done they've changed the map in the Middle East they've changed the map in Europe they've interfered in elections all over the world and so with very little lot Amir Putin he's like an investor who puts down $50 and walks away with $5,000 talk about return on investment Russia basically has gotten oversized returns with very little and there's no reason to think they'll stop this is working for him he has nothing to point to at home his domestic legacy is he inherited a country he's going to leave a wreck to whoever whenever that is but internationally he is basically had out size gains for very modest capabilities and investments so we're gonna go back now this is all going to bring us back to Rudy Giuliani who I actually just personally have not ever seen a more undisciplined big mouth except for the President himself who is actually as every time he speaks on television seems to create more problems for the president knighted States and helps out the investigators looking into everything surrounding the president speaking on behalf of Donald Trump's legal team Giuliani says that Special Counsel Robert Muller's office told him that they cannot bring criminal charges against the president Giuliani told NBC News that the reason is due to Justice Department Rules quote they know they don't have that power so their function is to write a report we would like it to be the fairest report possible but even if it isn't we're prepared to rebut it in great detail so we'd like them to do it Giuliani told The Washington Post Robert Costa that Muller was coy when discussing an indictment Kody didn't seem to want to give the answer one of his assistants broke in and said well of course were bound by Justice Department policies according to Giuliani Muller looked at the assistant as if to say don't interrupt me Giuliani said they confirmed they would not indict in a call a day or two later on Fox News last night Giuliani said he wouldn't give much credence to a negative report from Muller there's no reason for this investigation there never was a good reason for in the first place this was engineered like call me I'm still hopeful that when it comes down to it they're not going to compare their reputations with a bogus rumor if you're gonna write a fair report fine write it if you're gonna write an unfair report write it and we will combate it we're ready to rip it apart and we're ready to rip them apart Jeremy bash Rudy Giuliani see helping the president's case at this point and does he understand what this report is really about know and I think he revealed Mika something that we've been discussing but actually hasn't been confirmed by someone who's talked directly to the special counsel which is that the special counsel is indeed writing a report that was a question some folks mine some people said if Bob Muller found nothing upon which to file criminal charges he would just basically file a short memo with the Justice Department declining prosecution sort of a declension memo as it's called but in fact if the special counsel writes a very fulsome report but all the conduct that issue going all the way back to Russian interference in the election extending all the way through the obstruction of justice issues that is exactly what will be teed up for the Congress to consider as it weighs the weighty issue of impeachment Frank it's writing language really Giuliani last couple weeks often has said out loud the thing that we all assumed but maybe you're not supposed to say out loud and what he said last night was that we are prepared if this is negative to tear it down in other words all these interviews were doing in all these everything we've said about the FBI and implied about Bob Muller and said about the Justice Department is to D legitimize whatever is reported then comes out of Bob Mulder's office he doesn't know what Bob mullet is working on specifically he doesn't we don't know what Bob Muller has exactly but we do know there been indictments there been plea deals we've seen some outcomes from this investigation whatever comes out it seems to me unless it completely exonerates Donald Trump the white house and Rudy Giuliani and their team as he said out loud on Fox News last night will be torn to shreds by the White House so a couple of things one is the phrase tear it down is really telling because it implies we don't really have a substantive legal strategy rather we're gonna I intend to tear down the institutions and the people who got us here that's number one number two the kind of words and phrases we're hearing from mr. Giuliani are not the words of a substantive serious lawyer they're they're some kind of desperate PR spin that he's hoping people will latch on to so throwing out something like they can't indict because there's policy against it he wants people to actually believe that and actually believe that Muller won't challenge policy if he believes he can prosecute the president Mike Barnicle what has happened to Rudy Giuliani oh who knows well first of all one thing clearly has happened he hasn't been in a courtroom in 25 or 30 years so on his feet in terms of what he's talking about in the law when you see him on Fox News that's not a lawyer speaking that's a performer and it's exactly what Frank I'll just point out he showed up last week in Broward County Florida to represent an accident fraud victim who was a client but that's about it yeah there's something different though there's something morally unhinged I mean I thought I doesn't agree with a lot of his policies and and political points of view but he I thought he had some great moments in his career as an American well he did but he's you know well past that is that what it is well I think he I think he wants to get back into the spotlight into the limelight no matter what tact himself - Donald J Trump hoping that that will recreate what he once was I clearly the goal appears to be finding meaning once again and so that they only wanted to see something he's got from America's mayor to Trump's Lackey in a search for meaning in its waning years yeah willing to dirty himself for this guy doesn't it end badly it looks like it's headed that way yeah Frank Vick Lucy thank you very much still ahead a Morning Joe there's an entire other ankle to the Russia collusion question with a big front-page story in The Times today we'll dig through the newly revealed details about the FBI's closely held investigation of the Trump campaign that started before the president won the election plus did John Bolton torpedo the North Korea summit Richard Haass has thoughts on that today thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up to date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
