I mean better
thank you very much for following us all
over the world mr. Finn
it's a fascist if that
Michael so uh let's start with your name
so so what's your name my name's I say
not too big and where you from I'm from
Egypt and when did you start playing
soccer I started playing soccer when I
was around eight years old I was a kid
who at some point of his life when my
friends were getting at the voice I was
just looking for something to put all my
energy it was just like a simple get
away from everything
my grandfather was like a father to me
he just called me like a goalkeeper skit
on his way back from the business trip
he call me the shoes shared the gloves
so I was like I'll give it a try
I got scouted a few the very first thing
I was training with a cheapest coach and
I was diving for the ball as if like I
was riding into the water
coach came up to me like you on this
side from there the head coach of the
national team watched me play the next
thing we knew we got a call we're on the
squad to be like oh my god is this worry
of you know is this really happening and
my dad wasn't really happy that it was
my career he's like I know you're gonna
quit at some point and just work with me
I kept training day and night day and
night all on my own I was offered a
scholarship Ted Dee to school in Florida
I took it I played for a semester and I
just look at it my need it was one of
the worst injuries I've ever gotten I
was starting to get a grip of everything
and then boom it was all gone and when
this thing seemed really tough I lost my
grandfather the figure that I took as my
father the figure that I looked up to in
my entire life it just felt like
everything now was going
I went to college back home and I just
started working my dad
and at that point I just didn't think I
was I was ever gonna get back into
splits I just felt like I wasn't going
anywhere I just gave up soccer then it
was it was one of the most difficult
decisions I've ever had to make in my
life but it was a must
my sister kept nagging me every single
day to join her to train at the club in
the morning that was just functional
training back then I started training
with a friend of mine and all I was
doing was long as he liked researching
reading articles and I was just
implementing the workouts we got from
sulking and just like ignited something
in me I was really passionate that
developing athletes like I got the
opportunity to abroad in the states in
Spain to get physically ready in ways I
never I never knew as possible
I saw how skilled players are here and I
thought to myself actually should help
developing and giving them the
opportunity that they would never get
anywhere else
but my friend was like he had a
different vision and had my own visions
so I decided to take off and I started
ignite
when I started ignite I didn't have any
money but I knew where I was going
we started off with six people in a
borrowed gym space and that jumped up to
sixty people in a matter of weeks
like you could see the change of
character I'll be looked at themselves
how they felt everyone would come up to
us and be like oh you've changed my life
I don't know how to thank you
I started getting investors we started
opening other branches I started
traveling to take certifications and I
just wanted to know as much as I could
about the human body in mind it was
difficult at the beginning to have
people accept what we're doing as
science I didn't care how much money I
was making at the beginning I had to
Train athletes for free I had to work my
ass off almost 20 hours a day to get
people to understand what we're doing I
would sleep 2 to 3 hours a night to
program for my athletes there were times
where I would sit in my car and I just
cry not seeing a way forward but I like
to think things take time to happen it's
all about hard work and just giving it's
time I got a call from an athlete and I
started training with me in his will be
ranking just jumps so far up his own
coach is gonna believe it as a new Posse
it just spiked something
Wow this is what I want these are the
people I really want out I just don't
want to just be another trainer I want
to be a V train I want to be the one who
specializes in in training these pros
who specializes in changing lives
but players I trained started standing
out people started asking where they
were training where the mound started
the work and then one thing just led to
another and I went from getting the top
players in the league to the soccer
teams themselves
and I was completely against it actually
it was like are you flipping insane are
you out of your mind
quitting your family business they start
from scratch are you insane
it's something you already have you're
not gonna start all over again
he didn't understand I was trying to
build something on my own and so he just
caught me off in our culture in Egypt
there are certain jobs or certain
careers that are sort of an
embarrassment coaching was one of them
it didn't make a difference at all
I was helping more people prosper in
their work and their careers and that in
itself to me was like really fulfilling
I've lived most of my life with my
grandfather
like he was a great person he was a
great man he was always giving back to
society he was always giving back to
everyone around there I saw how
fulfilling it was to him and it just
like grew that into me I guess when I
first started ignite I was training one
pro athlete today my team and I we
trained over 200 the feeling I get when
when one of my athletes just advances in
their career it's big it's bigger than
the game itself
you
