00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:06,751
>> Tucker: TED CRUZ HAS CAST A

2
00:00:06,752 --> 00:00:07,618
VOTE THAT SOME DEMOCRATS DON'T

3
00:00:07,619 --> 00:00:07,919
LIKE.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,453
RATHER THAN WAIT UNTIL THE

5
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:11,022
ELECTIONS TWO WEEKS FROM NOW TO

6
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:12,156
VOTE AGAINST HIM, SOME DECIDED

7
00:00:12,157 --> 00:00:13,224
TO SCREAM AT HIM AND HIS WIFE IN

8
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:15,626
A RESTAURANT.

9
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:17,028
>> DO YOU THINK THAT PUTTING A

10
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,564
SEXUAL ASSAULT ON THE COURT IS A

11
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:20,565
GOOD THING FOR WOMEN?

12
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:23,234
>> GOD BLESS YOU.

13
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,202
>> THAT IS WHAT YOUR VOTE COST.

14
00:00:25,203 --> 00:00:27,004
>> I BELIEVE IN IT DUE PROCESS

15
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,573
PAIRED >> WHY DO YOU SUPPORT A

16
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:31,609
MAN THAT ABUSES WOMEN?

17
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,045
SHAME ON YOU, TED CRUZ.

18
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:35,279
>> GOD BLESS YOU.

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,249
>> SHAME ON YOU, TED CRUZ.

20
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,417
>> Tucker: "SHAME ON YOU, TED

21
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:42,887
CRUZ?"

22
00:00:42,888 --> 00:00:44,622
THAT WAS WASHINGTON NATIONAL

23
00:00:44,623 --> 00:00:45,022
AIRPORT.

24
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:46,290
HE IS NOT THE ONLY LAWMAKER

25
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,959
GETTING YELLED THAT THESE DAY,

26
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,127
MITCH McCONNELL RECENTLY

27
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:52,196
SCREAMED AT IN A RESTAURANT,

28
00:00:52,197 --> 00:01:01,806
WATCH.

29
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:03,240
>> Tucker: YOU WANT TO LIVE IN

30
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:04,175
THIS COUNTRY?

31
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:06,010
OF COURSE YOU DON'T, MOST PEOPLE

32
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:07,111
ARE HORRIFIED BY IT.

33
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:11,349
SOME PEOPLE DEFEND IT, FORMER

34
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,885
HILLARY AIDE SAID IT WAS A MADE

35
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:15,286
UP PROBLEM.

36
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:17,622
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

37
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:19,824
>> I WASN'T DEFENDING TED CRUZ,

38
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:21,726
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN REPUBLICANS

39
00:01:21,727 --> 00:01:24,996
CHANTING AT TED CRUZ, THE WAY HE

40
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:25,896
IS UNPOPULAR.

41
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:30,868
SCREAMING AT PEOPLE IN PUBLIC

42
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:32,269
PLACES -- IT IS NOT THE

43
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,537
WAY PEOPLE SHOULD BEHAVE,

44
00:01:33,538 --> 00:01:34,438
EDITION NOT ANYTHING WE SHOULD

45
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,740
DEFENDANT IS NOT THE COUNTRY

46
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:39,110
WANT TO LIVE IN, IS IT?

47
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:39,810
>> THE FIRST INSTANCE OF THIS

48
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:42,580
WAS SARAH SANDERS, WHO WAS IN A

49
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:45,349
RESTAURANT IN VIRGINIA AND WAS

50
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,683
EJECTED.

51
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:48,486
SHE WAS ASKED VERY NICELY TO

52
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:49,487
LEAVE.

53
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:52,089
SHE WAS ASKED NICELY MORE THAN

54
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,991
SOMETIMES YOU ARE NICE TO ME IN

55
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:55,026
TERMS OF QUESTIONS, SO I DO NOT

56
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:56,627
THINK THAT IS A HEAVY PRICE TO

57
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:57,862
PAY FOR SOMEONE WHO LIES WITH

58
00:01:57,863 --> 00:01:59,130
IMPUNITY EVERY DAY TO THE

59
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:00,598
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

60
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,833
>> Tucker: SO YOU WORK FOR

61
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:03,534
HILLARY CLINTON, WHOSE HUSBAND

62
00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:08,205
WAS IN CREDIBLY ACCUSED OF RAPE

63
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:10,407
BY SOMEONE WITH ALL KINDS OF

64
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:11,208
CONTEMPORANEOUS -- BUT THAT IS

65
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,310
NOT WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.

66
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:14,178
I'M JUST SAYING HE WAS ACCUSED

67
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:19,316
OF RAPE.

68
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:20,885
HIS MOTHER GAVE BIRTH TO HIM,

69
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:28,726
WHY SHOULD HE BE ALLOWED TO BE

70
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:29,193
IN A RESTAURANT?

71
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:29,894
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

72
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:30,594
>> NOBODY WAS PROTESTING SARAH

73
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:31,796
SANDERS MOTHERS, IT WAS SARAH

74
00:02:31,797 --> 00:02:32,129
SANDERS.

75
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,230
>> Tucker: BECAUSE SHE WORKS

76
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:35,032
FOR A GUY SHE DOESN'T LIKE.

77
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,434
>> SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK

78
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:38,069
THERE, SHE HAS FREE WILL, IT IS

79
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,137
AN HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO WORK

80
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:40,604
THERE.

81
00:02:40,605 --> 00:02:41,539
SHE CHOOSES EVERY DAY TO LIVE TO

82
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,541
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

83
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,843
PEOPLE ARE SEEING PUBLIC

84
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:46,544
OFFICIALS, AND THEY DON'T SEE

85
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:47,845
ANY ACCOUNTABILITY.

86
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:52,850
THEY ARE THINKING TO THEMSELVES

87
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:53,584
THEMSELVES -- ELECTIONS ARE TWO

88
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:53,884
WEEKS.

89
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:55,386
AT ONE POINT IS THIS OKAY?

90
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:59,824
100 DAYS AGO -- I'M NOT THE

91
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:01,692
ANGRY MOB, 100 DAYS AGO I

92
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:03,661
STARTED A PROTEST OUTSIDE THE

93
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,329
WHITE HOUSE.

94
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,630
AS LOYAL VIEWERS KNOW THAT I

95
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:07,932
COULDN'T HURT A FLY.

96
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:09,600
DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO SHUT

97
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:10,301
THAT DOWN BECAUSE HE DOESN'T

98
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:12,269
WANT PROTESTERS OUTSIDE.

99
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,937
>> Tucker: I'M GUESSING THE

100
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:16,307
POINT I'M MAKING, IS IT OKAY,

101
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:20,111
OR DO THINGS START TO FALL APART

102
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:21,112
OR DO THINGS START TO FALL APAR-

103
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:21,145
OR DO THINGS START TO FALL APARL

104
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:21,178
OR DO THINGS START TO FALL APART

105
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:21,212
OR DO THINGS START TO FALL APARS

106
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:21,312
OR DO THINGS START TO FALL APARH

107
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:21,345
OR DO THINGS START TO FALL APARN

108
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:21,378
OR DO THINGS START TO FALL APARS

00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:21,412
OR DO THINGS START TO FALL APARA

OR DO THINGS START TO FALL APAR'

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,180
OR DO THINGS START TO FALL APART

113
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:23,814
OKAY.

114
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:25,750
>> SINCE DONALD TRUMP HASN'T

115
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:26,684
BEEN SWORN IN, NOT ONE OF THOSE

116
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:28,018
DAYS HAS HE SAID WE HAVE TO DIAL

117
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:28,986
DOWN THE RHETORIC THAT I WOULD

118
00:03:28,987 --> 00:03:29,720
TELL YOU WHAT HE DID SAY.

119
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:34,959
THE LAST FEW DAYS -- I WILL TELL

120
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,459
YOU WHAT I SAW.

121
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,496
HE SPECIFICALLY -- WE ARE NOT IN

122
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:39,263
POWER.

123
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:43,868
>> Tucker: NO, BECAUSE -- ALL

124
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:44,602
THE ROBOTS THAT FINALLY YOU ARE

125
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:46,771
DOING THIS.

126
00:03:46,772 --> 00:03:49,073
TEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN YELLED

127
00:03:49,074 --> 00:03:50,107
AT -- ALL CONSERVATIVES.

128
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:52,610
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

129
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:54,979
>> I'M OKAY WITH SARAH SANDERS,

130
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,014
SECRETARY NIELSEN, AND MITCH

131
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:57,615
McCONNELL.

132
00:03:57,616 --> 00:03:58,516
YES, MITCH McCONNELL WAS MORE

133
00:03:58,517 --> 00:03:59,617
IN DANGER OF SALMONELLA IN THAT

134
00:03:59,618 --> 00:04:04,388
RESTAURANT THAN HE WAS --

135
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:05,055
>> Tucker: HILLARY CLINTON A

136
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:07,091
RESTAURANT, AND I WALK UP TO

137
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:12,363
HER -- SHE LEAVES --

138
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:14,532
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

139
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:16,934
UNPLEASANT AND OKAY.

140
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:18,869
I WENT SAY PROTESTING, YOU ARE

141
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,771
JUST -- IF I SEPARATED CHILDREN

142
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:21,906
FROM THEIR PARENTS AND I WENT TO

143
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:23,908
DINNER AT A MEXICAN RESTAURANT,

144
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:25,609
I WOULD REALIZE --

145
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,578
>> Tucker: HOW ABOUT IF I

146
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,279
ENDORSE THIRD TERM ABORTIONS?

147
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,580
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS I

148
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:30,447
DISAGREE WITH, I FIND IT

149
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:32,616
REPUGNANT THAT YOU SUPPORT, BUT

150
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:35,986
I'M NOT -- IS IT OKAY TO SCREAM

151
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:37,188
AT NANCY PELOSI UNTIL SHE LEAVES

152
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,822
A RESTAURANT?

153
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,323
THE ANSWER IS NO, IT IS NOT

154
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:41,859
OKAY, IT IS NEVER OKAY.

155
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,927
>> SHE WAS WALKING ON A

156
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:45,796
FUND-RAISER THE OTHER DAY -- YOU

157
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:48,532
DON'T SEE ANY OF US --

158
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:49,433
>> Tucker: IF I SAID

159
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:51,335
NANCY PELOSI, I WILL YELL AT YOU

160
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:52,236
UNTIL YOU LEAVE BECAUSE YOU

161
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:52,903
SUPPORT A POLICY I DISAGREE

162
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:55,940
WITH, I THINK A NORMAL PERSON

163
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:56,740
WOULD SAY --

164
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:59,610
>> THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED --

165
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:04,014
IN THE LAST TEN DAYS,

166
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:04,815
DONALD TRUMP USE THE NAME GEORGE

167
00:05:04,816 --> 00:05:06,250
SOROS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS

168
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:08,219
PRESIDENCY, AND THE GUY HAD A

169
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,220
PIPE BOMB IN HIS MAILBOX LAST

170
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:09,520
NIGHT.

171
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,689
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR

172
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:18,195
NOT SARAH SANDERS GETS HER --

173
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:21,699
YOU THINK IT IS A COINCIDENCE?

174
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,068
BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP RUNS

175
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:24,435
AROUND --

176
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:29,039
>> Tucker:   I'M LAUGHING

177
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,507
BECAUSE -- I HAVE CRITICIZED

178
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:32,877
SOROS A THOUSAND TIMES.

179
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:36,213
>> BUT I'M NOT DONALD TRUMP.

180
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:37,314
>> Tucker: ELECTED LEADERS ARE

181
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:39,183
NOT ALLOWED TO CRITICIZE GEORGE

182
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:39,483
SOROS?

183
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:41,785
>> IF THERE IS AN ANGRY MOB --

184
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:42,453
IF WE HAD GONE FROM COCONUT

185
00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:45,189
JUICE AND SOY TO ANGRY MOB, AND

186
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,090
EVERYONE IS SO WORRIED ABOUT

187
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:48,425
VIOLENCE, WHY HAS DONALD TRUMP

188
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:50,361
NOT SAID, EVERYONE NEEDS TO DIAL

189
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:51,095
IT DOWN?

190
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:53,097
THE RHETORIC IN OUR SOCIETY

00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:55,132
RIGHT NOW -- HE HAS NEVER SAID

192
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:59,603
IT, TUCKER.

00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:00,905
HE CALLED THE DEMOCRATS AN ANGRY

194
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:01,805
MOB.

195
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:03,807
>> Tucker: THEY ARE AN ANGRY

196
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:04,074
MOB.

197
00:06:04,075 --> 00:00:00,000
