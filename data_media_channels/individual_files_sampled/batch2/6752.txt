so cool thing about champey YT is that now you guys can also get rewards and I like that word you know making you guys part of the Young Turks as we always try to do so if you refer people to shop qit calm and they buy something first of all everybody's winner Merry Christmas they're gonna be 15% off and you're gonna get five bucks on your next purchase and and you can get cool shirts like this we are the ones who knocked the Young Turks or you could also get I think my shirt right your shirt is incredibly popular call Feifei whenever I wear these Bennet just told me this before we started the show I don't wear any of these shirts because most of them were designed by you know you or they're there they meet you're there you're there your standard of teacher so they're horrible but this one actually seems better I mean like the Roger stone criticism of jank was that he wears clothes that looked like they Hanes t-shirts that were coming the 3-pack right that's because that's what you think a t-shirt is right yeah and those are horrible and but this one is nicer is it slightly what do you like to give it it real okay so but what we're doing is confit whatever I wear that yeah all right people come up and say hi and they'll comment on the show and I'm sorry the shirt and sometimes half the time it'll be about the show they're like Kofi are there's no AJ right well half the time they don't know the show at all they're like oh that's a cool shirt so I threw this on not expecting to like it I was like wait a minute I kind of like this shirt and then I wore it to the airport and I'm like nine people stopped me yes if you wanted my friends get the contrary shirt at shops you y-t-dot-com and plus reverse the one and though you're 15% off and we go to the frequently asked questions and you'll get all the details and then they tell me that you're gonna get points that you're gonna get it I love the points but your your points for being born okay now I'm gonna go the free buy now that's about Jack anyway the reason that Ben doesn't like these shirts is because look uh yeah I'm a goofy guy one of the shirts is too strong okay we're the ones who knock that they you've got that kind of theme right now but I want you guys to have that swagger right that's what we're trying to do here so they're not coming for us we're coming for them that talking about the quality of the shirt only one way to find out did they make t-shirts like nice and this is good one knowing that maybe they're better now because I don't know that hey soos wanted he wanted it but everybody wanted to change him and wanted to rebel against you because you're so wrong and so maybe hey soos is taking charge and made something cuz this one's nice I like how sensitive is like your back and chest area to these shirts like I've always just liked they they feel fine to me I'm not I did begin not if you're not if he had his way help us build independent media together TYT Network comm slash join
