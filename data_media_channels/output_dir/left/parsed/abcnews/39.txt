>>> THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT.
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, FOR THOSE OF 
YOU WATCHING "GENERAL HOSPITAL" 
IT WILL BE PLAYED IN HIS 
ENTIRETY AFTER THIS BREAK.
WE DO HAVE BREAKING NEWS NOW.
IT'S IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION
LED BY SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT 
MUELLER.
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE FORMER 
DEPUTY CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN OF THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN RICK GATES, GOING
INTO COURT, YOU SEE HIM RIGHT 
THERE, IS NOW PLEADING GUILTY TO
TWO COUNTS OF CONSPIRACY AND 
FALSE STATEMENTS IN THE RUSSIA 
PROBE.
HE HAS BEEN INDICTED, CHARGED 
WITH SEVERAL COUNTS OF FRAUD, 
CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE UNITED 
STATES, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND 
FALSE STATEMENTS.
BUT HE HAS DECIDED NOW TO 
COOPERATE WITH THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL, PLEAD GUILTY TO TWO 
COUNTS.
WANT TO GET ALL THE DETAILS NOW 
FROM OUR CHIEF JUSTICE 
CORRESPONDENT PIERRE THOMAS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.
RICK GATES, FORMER DEPUTY 
CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S ELECTION BID, IS TODAY 
PLEADING GUILTY.
TWO COUNTS, FIRST HE'S PLEADING 
GUILTY FOR ENGAGING IN A 
CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT BY NOT 
REPORTING FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS 
THAT COULD BE TAXED, AND FAILING
TO REGISTER AS A FOREIGN AGENT 
FOR WORK ON BEHALF OF UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIALS WHO HAD CLOSE TIES TO 
THE KREMLIN.
GATES IS ALSO PLEADING GUILTY TO
ONE COUNT OF LYING TO A SPECIAL 
COUNSEL ABOUT THE NATURE OF WORK
DONE FOR THOSE UKRAINIAN 
OFFICIALS.
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL OFFICE 
CLAIMS THAT GATES ENGAGED IN 
THIS CONSPIRACY WITH PAUL 
MANAFORT, TRUMP'S FORMER 
CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN.
MANAFORT HAS PLEADED NOT GUILTY 
BUT NOW ONE OF HIS PRINCIPAL 
BUSINESS PARTNERS IS SET TO BE 
AND COOPERATING WITH THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL.
SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE 
ENORMOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR 
MANAFORT.
>> UNDER THE DOZENS OF CHARGES 
HE WAS FACING BEFORE TODAY'S 
PLEA AGREEMENT, HE COULD HAVE 
FACED YEARS AND YEARS IN PRISON.
WHAT SHOULD HE EXPECT NOW?
>> WELL, HE FACES AT LEAST UP TO
20 YEARS IN PRISON UNDER SOME OF
THOSE PREVIOUS CHARGES.
BUT BY OUR CALCULATIONS, HE'S 
LOOKING AT SOMEWHERE MAXIMUM OF 
BETWEEN FOUR AND SEVEN YEARS IN 
PRISON, GEORGE.
>> THAT'S THE MAXIMUM.
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE 
RECOMMENDATION OF THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER.
>> EXACTLY.
WE EXPECT THAT HE'S GOING TO 
COOPERATE, GEORGE, AND THAT 
COULD GIVE HIM MUCH MORE LENIENT
TIME, AS WELL.
>> OKAY, PIERRE, THANKS VERY 
MUCH.
WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF LEGAL
ANALYST DAN ABRAMS.
RIGHT NOW THE BIG QUESTION WITH 
THIS AGREEMENT WHAT DID HE GIVE 
TO ROBERT MUELLER TO GET IT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY 
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THIS DEAL 
UNLESS THEY FELT GATES HAD 
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO 
OFFER THEM.
AND SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING OUT 
THERE, WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS IS 
SO THEY CAN HELP GET HIS FORMER 
BOSS.
BUT MUELLER ALREADY HAD -- 
RIGHT.
SO MUELLER MAY NOT HAVE NEEDED 
GATES FOR MANAFORT.
SO THAT'S WHAT LEADS TO THE 
REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION.
WHICH IS, WHAT ELSE MIGHT GATES 
BE ABLE TO OFFER?
HE WAS THERE.
LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION.
HE TLFS DURING THE TRANSITION.
HE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP MUELLER 
PUT SOME OF THESE PIECES 
TOGETHER, WITH REGARD TO THE 
COLLUSION THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL
PART OF THIS CASE.
>> NOW WE HAVE THREE TOP 
OFFICIALS, THREE OFFICIALS IN 
THE CAMPAIGN WHO'VE ALL GONE NOW
WITH ROBERT MUELLER.
MIKE FLYNN, GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS 
FOREIGN POLICY ADVISER, RICK 
GATES, DEPUTY CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN.
>> AND EACH ONE OF THEM ARE 
GOING TO BE OFFERING INFORMATION
THAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL FEELS 
IS IMPORTANT NOT IN SOME MINOR 
ISSUE, BUT YOU MAKE THESE KINDS 
OF DEALS, BECAUSE THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL THINKS THAT THEY CAN 
OFFER INFORMATION.
THEY CAN TESTIFY AGAINST CERTAIN
PEOPLE.
THEY CAN OFFER TIMES, AND DATES,
AND PHONE CALLS, THAT ARE 
RELEVANT TO THIS INVESTIGATION.
AND SPEAKING OF THAT, I THINK 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ONE 
OF THE TWO COUNTS THAT GATES IS 
PLEADING GUILTY TO IS A FALSE 
STATEMENT MADE THIS MONTH.
>> JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
>> WHILE THEY WERE TRYING TO 
NEGOTIATE THIS DEAL.
WHICH SHOWS YOU THAT THEY ARE 
SAYING, HE WAS LYING TO US EVEN 
AS WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 
THIS.
>> NOW THERE IS A MAJOR 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE RUSSIA 
INVESTIGATION.
MUCH MORE TONIGHT ON "WORLD NEWS
WITH DAVID MUIR."
HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON.
>> THIS HAS BEEN A SPECIAL 
REPORT FROM ABC NEWS.
