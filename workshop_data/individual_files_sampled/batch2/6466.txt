it's John for The Young Turks and I've been following as I'm sure many of you are Donald Trump's both Matthew g7 and also the fallout from it since he has now moved on leaving us in a far worse off position with basically all of our longtime allies you name him he pissed them off and now McCrone is you know he's pissed off at him too and it doesn't look like things are gonna get much better from here on out certainly not anytime soon and I was thinking about that and I was frustrated but it took a while for me to realize exactly why it's as frustrating as it is and it's because there are at least to my mind maybe three different levels that even analyze his performance at the g7 on and it's the third one that I think I'm hearing about the least that actually worries me the most so first of all what are we worried about worried about him destroying and these did not international trade and setting up these tariffs what are the main problems though is him asserting that these other countries have tariffs that they don't have or that they're at levels that they're not and it frustrates me that any of his followers or him could simply look it up and see but they choose not to they're not actually interested in what the level of those tariffs are so he will assert that they need to be lowered they physically cannot be lowered it's not a thing that is possible and so there's no way for them to comply with his demands and it just drives an ever increasing in size wedge between us and our allies and so as I said there are three ways that you could analyze this the first is I think satisfying but probably not accurate and that's that he simply doesn't know he just doesn't know that the tariffs aren't at the level that he's saying and look their reason to believe this he is a moron he's not a curious person he refuses to fix the best try to go a little bit more to the Sun that he is not actually aware of the fact that he's wrong and that's possible he doesn't he doesn't know much as I said but I think that at this point he would have been told by somebody that he works for but that he was getting this wrong he'd get all the messages and be corrected by Shep Smith or something like that so I don't think that's what it is and so okay we go one step further and it might be that he simply wants to you know feel strong and big at the g7 and so he's gonna go in there and he's gonna attack them and he's in a bluster and it's all about him then it's not the ignorant it's the you know the brashness I guess the arrogance and that is certainly true to him too just like the ignorance it could be that that is the case he goes in there maybe he looks good or whatever and you play on the ignorance of your followers in terms of how international trade actually works and this is a thing that's been frustrating me too trying to communicate to people how tariffs actually work and what the the consequences of tariffs are and so you set up these tariffs and you tell your supporters that you're in on their side and you're trying to help them out analysis comes out showing that we're gonna lose about net 400,000 jobs and it's gonna hurt you know tons of American industries that rely on trade with the EU in Canada and Mexico and his followers don't actually understand that and it's damn near impossible to actually explain it to them it's complicated and they're not gonna listen to you so he might just be you know like he doesn't care he knows that it's wrong but he wants to feel big he wants to look like he's defending America that's the second level and there's something to that but I don't think that that's what it is either I think that it's something more subversive more disgusting and scarier as well it might be that this is not just about him looking good and he's willing to start feuds with a longtime allies to get it it might be that the feuds itself is what he is going for and that's why the video is titled the way it is so Donald Trump goes in there he's surrounded by all of our strongest economic and military allies he immediately says that he wants Russia to join the g7 he then says that Crimea Crimea was the invasion of Crimea was Obama's fault and that the people of Crimea are happier off with Russia anyway now obviously he got those talking points from Vladimir Putin we've read recently that he talks on the phone regularly with him says all of that and then immediately when it comes to the actual dealings with our allies he starts lobbing bombs they get pissed off it drives a wedge between us but is that actually an accident is it that they're not giving him what he wants or is what he wants to drive a wedge between us our allies and that may sound a little bit conspiratorial it may sound a little crazy so let me let me go a little bit further indefinitely Donald Trump said at the RNC I am the only one that can save you I'm the only one that can solve our problems and we know that since the very first time that he you know went down that escalator he's been trying to scare people about Mexicans he scares people about refugees and Islam and all of that and so there's this ever-increasing xenophobia hatred for the other and you can go pretty far on that with Mexicans and with via Muslims and stuff like that but we do you know typically historically have these strong relationships with Canada and with Europe and all of that it's a potential solution to our problems that he can't claim credit for and so for his base does he want them to think that France can help us that the UK or Germany or Canada can help us that we can learn something from them that we can work together to improve both of our countries in any one of these cases I don't think that he does I think that he wants us and especially his followers to feel like he is the only one you can trust he's the only one who has your back it doesn't matter what we've learned over the you know the past hundred plus years or whatever in some of these alliances you know maybe we've been working economically with a country for 50 to 70 years forget about them they don't care about you they attack the leader that you love and so forget about them you only have me and it doesn't matter if it you know devastates any number of different American industries it doesn't matter if it leaves people far worse off economically than they are today I think that the isolationism is what he wants and the thing is there a little bit of evidence for this position is look at how his followers have responded to what you know macron and and the leadership of Germany and you know Trudeau as well I guess a little bit before the g7 but the same sort of thing they love this somebody tweeted blow up blow up the g7 to own the libs and I think that that may sound a little bit condescending towards them but I think that it's a hundred percent true I think that they don't want attachment to these other countries and he certainly doesn't want them to have that attachment and if you care about our economy it's a scary goddamn thing okay we do need trade with these other countries think about our car companies yeah they're gonna sell plenty of cars to Americans but they're gonna sell a lot more in Europe and in China eventually you know since they have something like five times more people here but if he throws up tariffs on all these other car international car manufacturers they're gonna do the same to us think about the people who work for them I don't wanna see what the flicka whispers is I'm seeing some of your comments but anyway I want to focus on this we're gonna lose tons of jobs and then think about that think about he blows up all of these trade deals he came he harms our GDP overall he certainly harms individual industries jobs are lost and all of that so people lose their jobs are these people that are Trump supporters that lose their jobs are they gonna turn on him no he's gonna say and look we were screwed over by Canada and Mexico and all of that and I was the one who helped us by cutting off all trade with him he literally said that today by the way we should cut off all trade with these companies with these countries if they don't give us what they want and so this is uh this is scary I mean under Obama wages didn't grow nearly enough jobs you know many people I mean the unemployment rate certainly went down but a lot of that was really underemployment and people being forced into jobs that they don't want and then we have this I mean god only knows over the next few years how many jobs will end up being lost we think it's four hundred thousand now but wait until we get another couple of rounds of multibillion-dollar tariffs on individual industries if you care about the American working class this is a pretty this is a pretty scary display that he just put on for the international audience if you're one of his followers you might like it you might think that oh look there he's he's sick and his thumb in the eye of Merkel or or McCrone or whatever if you even know who those people are but he's also sticking it in you and he's certainly sticking it right into your wallet because you're going to lose out as a result of this and this gummy we're gonna talk a lot about the fallout from the g7 and you know whatever else might come from it as well as you know the summit with North Korea we're gonna break down all of that but we do need to keep an eye on what he's doing abroad it is some scary scary stuff not just for the the reasons that might seem obvious but for the ones lurking behind as well trying to get his followers to feel like there is no one in the world that is in it for him for them except for Donald Trump the person who cares the least about them possibly in the entire world anyway guys thank you for watching this it's been a little bit hard to follow your comments there's been a lot of them I'm not going to do some squats
