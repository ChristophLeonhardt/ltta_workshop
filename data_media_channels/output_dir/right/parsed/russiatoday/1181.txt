Isana Croatia if they are playing to
qualify in this moment I think ultra
competitive match they both know how to
compete I stand more tactical has done
more physical Croatia with more
experience with more control because of
that technical ability but I would say
without being in in in confrontation two
of the big teams or two candidates for I
would say even top eight this can be a
good match
