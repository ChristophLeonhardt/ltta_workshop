so I just got back from a trip to Havana Cuba business insider sent me down there as a tourist and spent a week in Cuba a place I never thought I'd go I had a great time I drank rum I smoked cigars saw a lot of great music had a lot of great food rode around in beautiful classic American cars spent time on a gorgeous Beach but if you're an American tourist thinking of jumping on a plane and heading to Cuba there are a few things that you should know about first of all the internet situation there is ZERO internet when you're walking around town so if you want to use Google Maps to get around the very dense streets of Havana you're gonna be out of luck you're gonna actually have to use a paper map the only way to use Internet is in the big hotels and those hotels charge you a rate of ten dollars an hour to use internet so that's going to get very expensive another thing is the water situation we were advised not to drink any tap water anywhere in the city in our apartment in hotels and restaurants every single drop of water that we drank the entire week while we were in Cuba was bottled you'll find this issue in a lot of countries like Mexico and India where a lot of tourists like to go but it's something you need to think about another thing I found surprising is that hardly anybody speaks English if you don't speak Spanish or you're not with someone that speaks fluent Spanish I feel like you're gonna run into a lot of problems even at hotels and restaurants the amount of English being spoken was very limited so be ready for that so the last big thing you need to think about is money you're gonna need to bring a lot of cash being down there we found that no one accepted American credit cards or debit cards you have to have a lot of cash on you at all times no one likes to walk around with a lot of cash on them but you always need to spend money when you're in Cuba for cabs and food and water the currency is referred to as a convertible peso and you can trade in American dollars for that at different exchange spots and tells again if you're ready to deal with these issues you can have a great time like I did I really had a blast in Cuba and I would definitely go back those are just some things you need to think about before you head to Havana
