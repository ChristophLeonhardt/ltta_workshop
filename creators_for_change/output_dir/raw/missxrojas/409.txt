00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
hey guys so I'm filming<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside again</font>

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">because that she quite nice from the</font>

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,870
outside it's something that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

4
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,640
do more this month today's challenge day

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,200
number two I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried something new the</font>

6
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,760
new years revolution give something away

7
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,500
and i felt quite hard about what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

8
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,269
give away because I haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

9
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">that much stuff at the moment I've given</font>

10
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,480
quite a lot away in preparation of all

11
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,580
the exciting moving going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did</font>

12
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,170
general I don't really own many things

13
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,119
apart from books and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it was hard</font>

14
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,470
because my cousin staying in the room

15
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,910
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my old room which is well my</font>

16
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,170
book<font color="#CCCCCC"> closed so I had to wait till I got</font>

17
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,119
up absorbs hope laughs but eventually I

18
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,800
decided which books I wanted to give

19
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,539
away we say wanted to give away it did

20
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,549
take quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of self persuasion for</font>

21
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,750
me to part with these books and they're

22
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,070
not my only copies of these books either

23
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,719
I mean I have other copies but I'm a

24
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,930
lover of specific editions and I I just

25
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,879
like having books that reminded me of

26
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,129
where I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I bought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them so yeah</font>

27
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,629
it took a lot persuasion but I was at

28
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,520
eight days until the<font color="#E5E5E5"> release of this</font>

29
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">author's brand new book I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

30
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,700
this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a favorite give and</font>

31
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,050
I didn't just want to give one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font>

32
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give the whole collection looking for</font>

33
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask is actually signed I got it signed</font>

34
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,020
for someone who I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never run into again</font>

35
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,460
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quite sad when it has</font>

36
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,690
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little message and everything the</font>

37
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,340
abundance of katherines i bought i think

38
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,619
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was in Chicago when i met john</font>

39
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,299

small Grayson Will Grayson it's a

43
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,580
company that I bought when I was in

44
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,409
Miami with a bunch of my friends so I'm

45
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to leave these probably on the</font>

46
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,159
bench<font color="#E5E5E5"> over of a train station somewhere</font>

47
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,600
i dunno it's quite hard knowing where to

48
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,100
leave packaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> I write a little note</font>

49
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,390
which you'll probably see me doing in a

50
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,280
second as I get on a tube and go

51
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,840
somewhere else I'm quite sad about this

52
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,210
there is a nice little floral both so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

53
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,520
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it's okay so much let me</font>

54
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you did feel fulfillment of this</font>

55
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,100
mission or through gene the other two

56
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,420
challenges about saving money and

57
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting fit as it turns out the hardest</font>

58
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,350
challenge wasn't giving books away that

59
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,479
i bought in favorite places it was in

60
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,549
fact tearing a pagent from the diary<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

61
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">going that has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> area snoopy possess sweet</font>

62
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,990
foods almost six seventy two thousand

63
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,659
nine right<font color="#CCCCCC"> food super happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> busty and</font>

64
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,640
two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of really changed me</font>

65
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,380
quite a lot so I've been hanging on Jan

66
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,149
it's trying to write from<font color="#CCCCCC"> teeny tiny</font>

67
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,070
writing I realized I'd forgotten some

68
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,320
favorites so I were paid out and since

69
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,149
it quite appropriate that was quite

70
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,399
proud of doing it let's find out you

71
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,740
think that one thing giving away big

72
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,719
things we've done is going to be the

73
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">hardest part but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you realize things</font>

74
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,520
come into alignment to show you anyway

75
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,160
that those aren't the hardest one

76
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,560
so I think in a challenge in them it do

77
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,740
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice and giving something away</font>

78
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,900
it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you realize that those things</font>

79
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't I mean my master and it matter to</font>

80
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">me to me to me it meant something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

81
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,190
something away that meant something but

82
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,340
and in contrast<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that one that piece</font>

83
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,520
of paper that you see me writing an app

84
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,280
for books for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Clendon nothing but</font>

85
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,220

86
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,910
everything but yeah hey Allison<font color="#E5E5E5"> tight</font>

87
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,260

93
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,160
words how reading it make made you feel

94
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can't you can't recreate that</font>

95
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,910
for them<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to because</font>

96
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,720
it's a personal thing but yeah this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

97
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,830
harder challenge I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

98
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,560
funny but it was a good challenge so

99
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,650
yeah good hips and I found them feel

100
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,870
like them and I left in it from your

101
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,500
vibe OH after putting out a cryptic

102
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,720
tweet you know that cryptic but it

103
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,459
sounded cryptic which is why I picked it

104
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,150
oh and now we go and look shown up<font color="#CCCCCC"> canal</font>
