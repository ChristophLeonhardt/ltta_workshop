00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
“It isn’t truth.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,980
Truth isn’t truth.”

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,230
“Wasn’t it irresponsible
for him [Donald Trump],

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,840
at that point, to be
saying such things

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,170
without having any facts?”

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,750
“He’s welcome to speculate.”

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,700
“Sean Spicer, our
press secretary, gave

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,620
alternative facts
to that.”

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,310
Reporter: “How are 
the American people

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,140
to trust or believe
what is said here

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,880
or what is said
by the president?”

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,950
“We give the very
best information

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,840
that we have at the time.”

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,550
“You stated it as fact.”

15
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,480
“Well, maybe I did.

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,940
But right now, I’m at the
point where I’m learning

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,350
and I can only — 
I can’t prove that,

18
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,679
I can just say it’s rumor. ...

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,220
I don’t know.

20
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,050
How do you separate
fact and opinion?”

21
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,330
“What you’re seeing and
what you’re reading

22
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,240
is not what’s happening.”

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,570
“In a situation like this,

24
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,390
you have — over time —
facts develop.

25
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,100
That’s what investigations do.”

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,680
“It’s in the eye
of the beholder.”

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,300
“No, facts are not 
in the eye of the beholder.”

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,960
“Yes it is.”

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,540
“It’s somebody’s version
of the truth, not the truth.

30
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,630
He didn’t have
a conversation about —”

31
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,790
“Truth is truth. 
I don’t mean to go like —”

32
00:01:07,790 --> 00:00:00,000
“No, it isn’t truth.
Truth isn’t truth.”
