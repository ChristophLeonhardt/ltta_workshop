1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,812
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BREAKING

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:06,715
NEWS, OPENING MONOLOGUE.

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:07,549
TONIGHT, JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,751
IS FIGHTING BACK AND STANDING UP

5
00:00:08,751 --> 00:00:11,120
FOR HIS GOOD NAME AND HIS

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,521
REPUTATION, AND HE IS DEMANDING

7
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:13,389
A FAIR PROCESS.

8
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:16,692
HE SAYS HE WON'T BE INTIMIDATED

9
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:18,627
AFTER DAYS OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH

10
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:19,695
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

11
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:21,196
PROFESSOR CHRISTINE FORD HAS NOW

12
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:23,165
AGREED TO TESTIFY ABOUT THE

13
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:23,866
ALLEGATIONS SHE MADE AGAINST

14
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:27,169
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

15
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:28,070
LET ME BE PERFECTLY CLEAR.

16
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,306
THESE ARE MYSTERIOUS ALLEGATION

17
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:32,341
ALLEGATIONS, -- SERIOUS

18
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:34,309
ALLEGATIONS, I SAID IT MANY

19
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:34,910
TIMES.

20
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,178
PROFESSOR FORD DESERVES TO BE

21
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:37,313
HEARD AND THOSE ALLEGATIONS

22
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:39,348
SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

23
00:00:39,348 --> 00:00:40,316
THIS COMING THURSDAY, YOU THE

24
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:42,118
AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO

25
00:00:42,118 --> 00:00:44,186
HEAR FROM BOTH PROFESSOR FORD

26
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:46,655
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH IN AN OPEN

27
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:47,390
SETTING.

28
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,290
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY OF THE SENATE

29
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,558
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WAS RIGHT TO

30
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:50,993
HOLD THE HEARING, AND THE

31
00:00:50,993 --> 00:00:53,162
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN AND ARE

32
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:56,132
BEING EXTREMELY FAIR AND

33
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:58,901
ACCOMMODATING AND TAKING THESE

34
00:00:59,035 --> 00:01:01,570
BUT TONIGHT WE NEED TO    TO A S

35
00:01:01,570 --> 00:00:57,033
BUT TONIGHT WE NEED TO    TO A E

36
00:00:57,033 --> 00:01:01,604
ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY.

37
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:01,837
BUT TONIGHT WE NEED TO    TO A P

38
00:01:01,837 --> 00:01:04,540
BACK AND REMEMBER WHAT WE ARE

39
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,741
TALKING ABOUT HERE.

40
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:07,676
THESE ARE 35-YEAR-OLD

41
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:08,511
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS

42
00:01:08,511 --> 00:01:10,313
MADE BY PROFESSIONAL OR FORWARD

43
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:11,747
IT TO CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS.

44
00:01:11,747 --> 00:01:13,816
THE CLAIMS DATE BACK TO WHEN

45
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:16,552
FORD AND KAVANAUGH WERE IN

46
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:16,986
HIGH SCHOOL.

47
00:01:16,986 --> 00:01:19,689
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN, SHE

48
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:20,923
WAS AWARE OF PROFESSOR FORD'S

49
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:23,159
ALLEGATIONS SINCE JULY.

50
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,860
SHE SAT ON THEM AND KEPT IN THE

51
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,861
SECRET.

52
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:29,498
UNTIL AFTER CAVANAUGH AND

53
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:30,199
KAVANAUGH'S A PUBLIC HEARING

54
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:34,003
LENGTHY MEETINGS WITH JUDGE

55
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:34,537
KAVANAUGH.

56
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:35,738
IN FACT, DIANNE FEINSTEIN

57
00:01:35,738 --> 00:01:37,707
REFUSED TO CONSENT REPUBLICANS,

58
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:38,541
OR COLLEAGUES, THE FULL

59
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,709
UNREDACTED LETTER WHERE

60
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,377
ACCUSATIONS WERE FIRST MADE BACK

61
00:01:41,377 --> 00:01:43,879
IN JULY UNTIL TODAY.

62
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,513
NOW PROFESSOR FORD CANNOT

63
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:45,948
REMEMBER THE DATE OR LOCATION OF

64
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:47,950
THE ALLEGED INCIDENT.

65
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,518
THE FOUR WITNESSES THAT FORD

66
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:50,753
HERSELF LISTED TO CORROBORATE

67
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:54,390
HER CLAIMS, THEY ARE ALL NOW ON

68
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,993
RECORD DENYING WHAT FORD IS

69
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:58,127
ALLEGING.

70
00:01:58,127 --> 00:02:00,730
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SAT DOWN WITH

71
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,298
OUR OWN MARTHA MacCALLUM AND

72
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:02,965
CATEGORICALLY REFUTED THESE

73
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:04,667
CLAIMS ONCE AGAIN.

74
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,903
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

75
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:09,005
>> Judge Kavanaugh: I MAY HAVE

76
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,773
MET HER, WE DID NOT TRAVEL IN

77
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:11,574
THE SAME SOCIAL CIRCLES.

78
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:14,477
SHE WAS NOT A FRIEND OR SOMEONE

79
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:14,844
I KNEW.

80
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,579
>> Martha: IF YOU DON'T

81
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,747
REMEMBER BEING AT PARTIES WITH

82
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:18,881
HER EVER?

83
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,516
>> Judge Kavanaugh: I DO NOT.

84
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:21,550
THIS IS AN ALLEGATION ABOUT A

85
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,353
PARTY IN THE SUMMER OF 1982 AT A

86
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,755
HOUSE ON CONNECTICUT AVENUE ON

87
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:27,590
EAST WEST HIGHWAY WITH FIVE

88
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,057
PEOPLE PRESENT.

89
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:30,559
I WAS NEVER AT ANY SUCH PARTY.

90
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:31,928
THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLEGED

91
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:33,996
TO BE PRESENT SAID THEY DON'T

92
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:34,764
REMEMBER ANY SUCH PARTY.

93
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:40,236
A WOMAN WHO WAS PRESENT, OF

94
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:40,937
ANOTHER WOMAN WHO WAS PRESENT

95
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:41,604
WHO IS DR. FORD'S LIFELONG

96
00:02:41,604 --> 00:02:44,741
FRIEND HAS SAID SHE DOESN'T KNOW

97
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:46,743
ME, AND NEVER REMEMBERS BEING AT

98
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:47,710
A PARTY WITH ME AT ANY TIME IN

99
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,916
HER LIFE.

100
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,951
>> Sean: NOW KAVANAUGH IS

101
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:55,752
FACING ONE MORE ALLEGATION

102
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:57,120
BECAUSE OVER THE WEEKEND, THE

103
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,154
NEW YORKER BROUGHT UP ANOTHER

104
00:02:58,154 --> 00:03:01,391
DECADES-OLD CLAIM AGAINST AND

105
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,326
KAVANAUGH, IN THIS CASE A WOMAN

106
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:03,993
NAMED DEBORAH RAMIREZ.

107
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:06,496
SHE IS CLAIMING THAT IN THE

108
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:08,932
1980s WHEN HE WAS IN COLLEGE,

109
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:09,732
THAT KAVANAUGH EXPOSED HIMSELF

110
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:12,936
TO HER AT A DRUNKEN COLLEGE

111
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:13,903
PARTY AT YALE UNIVERSITY.

112
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:16,472
RAMIREZ HERSELF WASN'T TOTALLY

113
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:18,841
SURE IF KAVANAUGH WAS A

114
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:21,110
PERPETRATOR.

115
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,279
SHE BECAME "QUICKLY INEBRIATED"

116
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:25,114
AT THE PARTY, HER WORDS.

117
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:27,684
SHE TOLD THE NEW YORKER THAT SHE

118
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:29,252
WASN'T "FOGGY AND SLURRING HER

119
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:29,752
WORDS."

120
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:30,954
SHE EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES SHE HAD

121
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:34,090
SIGNIFICANT MEMORY GAP FROM THAT

122
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,424
EVENING.

123
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:35,258
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" SPENT OVER

124
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,360
A WEEK TRYING TO CORROBORATE HER

125
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,761
STORY, TALKING TO DOZENS OF

126
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:41,564
PEOPLE, AND OF THE TIME SAID

127
00:03:41,564 --> 00:03:42,732
THIS, "THEY HAVE INTERVIEWED

128
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:43,766
SEVERAL DOZEN PEOPLE OVER THE

129
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,969
PAST WEEK IN AN ATTEMPT TO

130
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:47,303
CORROBORATE HER STORY.

131
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:49,873
THEY COULD FIND NO ONE WITH

132
00:03:49,873 --> 00:03:51,541
FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE.

133
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,876
MS. RAMIREZ HERSELF CONTACTED

134
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:54,144
FORMER YALE CLASSMATES ASKING IF

135
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:55,178
THEY RECALL THE INCIDENT AND

136
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:56,079
TOLD SOME OF THEM THAT SHE COULD

137
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,948
NOT BE CERTAIN THAT

138
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,049
MR. KAVANAUGH WAS THE ONE WHO

139
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:02,085
EXPOSED HIMSELF.

140
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:04,421
AND THOSE WHO REMARRY IS LISTED

141
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:07,323
AS WITNESSES IN YET ANOTHER CASE

142
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:08,291
HERE, WELCOME TO THE INDECENT

143
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,192
CHARGES?

144
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:15,198
THEY ARE ALL FLATLY DENYING.

145
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:16,766
IF THE INCIDENT DEBBIE ALLEGES

146
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:17,901
EVER OCCURRED, WE WOULD HAVE

147
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:21,071
SEEN OR HEARD ABOUT IT.

148
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,072
BUT WE HAVE NOT.

149
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:23,640
THE BEHAVIOR SHE DESCRIBES WOULD

150
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,641
BE COMPLETELY OUT OF CHARACTER

151
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,342
FOR BRETT.

152
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:27,143
IN ADDITION, SOME OF US KNEW

153
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,346
DEBBIE LONG AFTER YALE AND SHE

154
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:31,248
NEVER DESCRIBES THIS INCIDENT

155
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:32,816
UNTIL HIS SUPREME COURT

156
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:33,416
NOMINATION WAS PENDING.

157
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,585
THE NEW YORKER ALSO INTERVIEWED

158
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:36,953
RAMIREZ'S BEST FRIEND AT THE

159
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:38,154
TIME OF THE ALLEGED INCIDENT AND

160
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:40,290
SHE'S ALSO DENYING ANY KNOWLEDGE

161
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,158
OF THE CLAIMS.

162
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:42,592
AND SHE SAID IT "THIS WAS A

163
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:44,928
WOMAN KNOWS BEST FRIEND WITH, WE

164
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:47,130
SHARED INTIMATE DETAILS OF HER,

165
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,631
OUR LIVES.

166
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:49,199
I WAS NEVER TOLD THE STORY BY

167
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,934
HER OR ANYONE ELSE.

168
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:52,836
I NEVER SAW IT OR HEARD OF IT

169
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:55,706
HAPPENING."

170
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:57,941
JUDGE KAVANAUGH ALSO DENIED

171
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:58,876
EMPHATICALLY THESE DECADE-OLD

172
00:04:58,876 --> 00:04:59,543
CHARGES.

173
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:01,678
IN A STATEMENT HE WROTE "THESE

174
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:03,146
ARE SMEARS, PURE AND SIMPLE AND

175
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:03,881
THEY DEBASE OUR PUBLIC

176
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:04,248
DISCOURSE.

177
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:05,549
BUT THEY ARE ALSO A THREAT TO

178
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:08,352
ANY MAN OR WOMAN WHO WISHES TO

179
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:10,154
SERVE OUR COUNTRY.

180
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:11,522
SUCH GROTESQUE AND OBVIOUS

181
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:12,623
CHARACTER ASSASSINATIONS, IF

182
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:14,925
ALLOWED TO SUCCEED, IT WILL

183
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:15,926
DISSUADE COMPETENT AND GOOD

184
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:19,930
PEOPLE OF ALL POLITICAL

185
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,731
PERSUASIONS FROM SERVICE.

186
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:22,500
AS I TOLD THE COMMITTEE DURING

187
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,734
THE HEARING, A FEDERAL JUDGE

188
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:25,403
MUST BE INDEPENDENT, NOT SWAYED

189
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:29,307
BY PUBLIC OR POLITICAL PRESSURE.

190
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:31,943
THAT'S A KIND OF JUDGE I WOULD

191
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:42,520
ALWAYS BE AND AND AT THE

192
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,254
VIOLENCE AGAINST MY FAMILY WOULD

193
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:50,528
NOT DRIVE THEM OUT.

194
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:51,729
KAVANAUGH DENIED THESE CHARGES

195
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:53,798
IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH MARTHA.

196
00:05:53,798 --> 00:05:55,700
TAKE A LOOK.

197
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,367
>> Judge Kavanaugh: I NEVER

198
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:58,135
DID ANY SUCH THING.

199
00:05:58,135 --> 00:05:59,804
THE OTHER PEOPLE ALLEGED TO BE

200
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:01,205
THERE DON'T RECALL ANY SUCH

201
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:01,539
THING.

202
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:03,140
IF SUCH A THING HAD HAPPENED, IT

203
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,443
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TALK OF

204
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:05,776
CAMPUS.

205
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:07,945
THE WOMEN I KNEW IN COLLEGE, AND

206
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:10,114
THE MEN I KNEW IN COLLEGE THAT

207
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:10,848
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT I COULD

208
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:14,118
HAVE DONE SUCH A THING, AND

209
00:06:14,118 --> 00:06:15,086
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" HAS

210
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:17,154
REPORTED THAT JUST LAST WEEK THE

211
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:17,955
PERSON MAKING THE ACCUSATION WAS

212
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:21,225
CALLING OTHER CLASSMATES, SAYING

213
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:23,127
SHE WAS NOT SURE THAT AND I HAD

214
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:25,162
DONE THIS.

215
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:27,898
AGAIN, JUST ASKING FOR A FAIR

216
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:30,101
PROCESS WHERE I CAN BE HEARD AND

217
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:32,603
I CAN DEFEND MY INTEGRITY.

218
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:33,871
>> Sean: DURING THIS INTERVIEW

219
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:36,741
HE TOOK IT EVEN A STEP FURTHER.

220
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:37,141
WATCH THIS.

221
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:37,942
>> Judge Kavanaugh: PEOPLE

222
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:39,543
GENERALLY IN HIGH SCHOOL, I

223
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:42,113
THINK ALL OF US HAVE LOOKED BACK

224
00:06:42,113 --> 00:06:43,547
ON THINGS AND REGRETTED OR

225
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:44,281
CRINGED A BIT.

226
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:45,950
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE TALKING

227
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,550
ABOUT.

228
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,552
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN

229
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:50,921
ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

230
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,456
I NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

231
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:52,890
ANYONE.

232
00:06:52,890 --> 00:07:07,238
I NEVER HAVE DONE ANYTHING LIKE

233
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:07,538
THAT.

234
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:09,140
>> Martha: SO ALL THESE YEARS

235
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,311
IN QUESTION, YOU ARE A?

236
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:13,978
>> Judge Kavanaugh: THAT'S

237
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:15,746
CORRECT.

238
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:16,781
>> Martha: YOU NEVER HAD

239
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:19,016
INTERCOURSE WITH ANYONE IN

240
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:22,119
HIGH SCHOOL?

241
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,188
>> Judge Kavanaugh: AND MANY

242
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:24,589
YEARS AFTER.

243
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:26,557
>> Sean: THEN HE WENT ON TO

244
00:07:26,557 --> 00:07:28,159
DEFEND HIS CHARACTER IN

245
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:28,559
HIGH SCHOOL.

246
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,227
>> Martha: WAS THERE EVER A

247
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:32,663
TIME YOU DRINK SO MUCH SHE

248
00:07:32,663 --> 00:07:33,331
COULDN'T REMEMBER THE NIGHT

249
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:35,166
BEFORE?

250
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:59,190
>>

251
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,124
WOMEN BEING TAKEN INTO ROOMS AND

252
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:00,858
OR HAVING WITH A NUMBER OF MEN,

253
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:01,592
CONSENSUAL OR OTHERWISE, WAS NOT

254
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:02,327
GOING ON AT THE PARTY'S ERRATIC?

255
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:02,994
>> Judge Kavanaugh: I NEVER

256
00:08:02,994 --> 00:08:03,528
SAW ANY SUCH THING.

257
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:04,228
I CERTAINLY NEVER PARTICIPATED

258
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:04,929
IN ANY SUCH THING BUT I NEVER

259
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:05,663
SAW OR HEARD OF ANY SUCH THING.

260
00:08:05,663 --> 00:08:06,364
I WAS FOCUSED ON TRYING TO BE

261
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:08,166
NUMBER ONE IN MY CLASS AND BEING

262
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,101
CAPTAIN OF THE VARSITY

263
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:12,337
BASKETBALL TEAM, AND IT DURING

264
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:14,606
MY SERVICE PROJECTS, AND GOING

265
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:15,040
TO CHURCH.

266
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,308
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TIME I

267
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:18,610
SPENT IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS

268
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,047
STUDYING, OR FOCUSED ON SPORTS

269
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:24,283
AND BEING A GOOD FRIEND TO THE

270
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:26,251
BOYS AND THE GIRLS THAT I WAS

271
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:26,752
FRIENDS WITH.

272
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:30,556
WE HAVE THESE GREAT LIFELONG

273
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:31,924
FRIENDSHIPS.

274
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:32,591
>> Sean: DESPITE ALL THESE

275
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:33,558
CHARGES, JUDGE KAVANAUGH SAYS HE

276
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:35,159
WILL NOT BE QUIET AND HE'S

277
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,296
VOWING NOT TO BE INTIMIDATED

278
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:39,131
INTO WITHDRAWING HIS NOMINATION.

279
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:40,365
WHILE JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS

280
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:41,967
STANDING FIRM, RIGHTLY DEMANDING

281
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,368
A FAIR PROCESS, IT IS SO

282
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:45,470
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE TOLD

283
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,340
THAT IT ALSO TAKES ON A FAMILY.

284
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,842
AGAIN, WHERE IS THE PRESUMPTION

285
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:51,276
OF INNOCENCE?

286
00:08:51,276 --> 00:08:52,611
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

287
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:56,348
>> IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE

288
00:08:56,348 --> 00:09:07,392
THESE CONVERSATIONS, AND THEY

289
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:10,329
KNOW BRETT AND THEY KNOW, WE

290
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:12,064
TOLD HIM AT THE VERY BEGINNING

291
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:13,565
OF THIS PROCESS THAT IT'S NOT

292
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:13,999
FUN SOMETIMES.

293
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,735
HE WILL HEAR THINGS THAT PEOPLE

294
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:19,071
FEEL STRONGLY, AND JUST

295
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:24,142
REMEMBER, YOU KNOW YOUR DAD.

296
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:25,143
>> Sean: NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP

297
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:26,845
IS STANDING BY HIS NOMINEE AND

298
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:27,546
PREDICTED HER EARLIER TONIGHT

299
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:30,148
THAT HE WILL BE CONFIRMED.

300
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:30,582
LOOK AT THIS.

301
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:32,651
>> IT WILL BE SAD INDEED IF

302
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:33,685
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO REROUTE

303
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:33,986
THAT.

304
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:35,621
THIS IS A FINE MAN AND CERTAINLY

305
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:38,790
HOPE HE'S GOING TO BE CONFIRMED

306
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,224
AND QUICKLY.

307
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:43,896
HIS FAMILY HAS SUFFERED.

308
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:44,496
WHAT IS GOING ON IS NOT

309
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:47,833
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN.

310
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,535
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS AN ABSOLUTE

311
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:52,137
OUTSTANDING PERSON AND

312
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:54,640
HOPEFULLY, HE WILL BE CONFIRMED

313
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,140
QUICKLY.

314
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,746
>> Sean: THIS ALL COMES AS ONE

315
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:02,748
FALLS RUMOR HAS BEEN DEBUNKED.

316
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:03,949
MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS

317
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:05,551
WERE GLEEFULLY SPREADING A RUMOR

318
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:06,385
THAT FEMALE STUDENTS WERE

319
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:07,787
COACHED BY A LAW PROFESSOR ON

320
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:12,892
HOW TO DRESS IN AN OUTGOING WAY

321
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:15,427
WHEN THEY WERE INTERVIEWING WITH

322
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:17,329
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, A RUMOR THAT

323
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:19,565
THE PROFESSOR HAS COMPLETELY

324
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:20,333
DENIED.

325
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,169
AT IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING WE

326
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:25,137
JUST SHOWED YOU, THEIR PEOPLE IN

327
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:26,739
THIS COUNTRY THAT SHOULD NOT BE

328
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:27,206
POLITICAL.

329
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:29,575
DEMOCRATS, PEOPLE ON THE LEFT,

330
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:30,242
THEY HAVE ALREADY CONVICTED

331
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:31,944
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

332
00:10:31,944 --> 00:10:33,546
ACCORDING TO THEM HE HAS KNOWN

333
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:34,814
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND NO

334
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:37,917
RIGHT TO BE HEARD, NO REASON TO

335
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,852
BE BELIEVED, NO DUE PROCESS.

336
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:42,655
ACTUALLY, THERE WERE LAWMAKERS,

337
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:44,590
LAWMAKERS THAT WERE THROWING LAW

338
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,227
OUT THE WINDOW AND CLAIMING HIS

339
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:50,363
GUILT BY ACCUSATION.

340
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,999
THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IN THIS

341
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:53,899
COUNTRY.

342
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:54,300
TAKE A LOOK.

343
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,137
>> THE SENATE SHOULDN'T RELY ON

344
00:10:58,137 --> 00:10:59,739
TO CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS AND

345
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:01,941
DECIDE, WE ARE OKAY WITH NOT

346
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:02,642
KNOWING, WE ARE OKAY WITH THE

347
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:06,946
FACT THAT WE MIGHT BE PUTTING

348
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:12,752
SOMEONE WHO COMMITTED ATTEMPTED

349
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:13,119
RAPE.

350
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,154
>> I BELIEVE HER.

351
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:17,390
ANYONE WHO COMES FORWARD AT THIS

352
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,458
POINT TO BE PREPARED TO TESTIFY

353
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,126
IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE

354
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:21,894
AGAINST SOMEONE WHO IS BEING

355
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:22,662
NOMINATED TO ONE OF THE MOST

356
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:24,030
POWERFUL POSITIONS IN THE

357
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,097
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, THAT

358
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:25,865
TAKES AN EXTRA ORDINARY AMOUNT

359
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:28,367
OF COURAGE.

360
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,536
>> NOT ONLY DO WOMEN LIKE

361
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:31,537
DR. FORD WHO BRAVELY COME

362
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:32,271
FORWARD NEED TO BE HER TO COME

363
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:35,975
UP BUT THEY NEED TO BE BELIEVED.

364
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:36,609
THEY NEED TO BE BELIEVED.

365
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,744
>> I WANT TO SAY TO THE MEN OF

366
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:41,147
THIS COUNTRY, SHUT UP AND STEP

367
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:41,981
UP, DO THE RIGHT THING.

368
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:44,583
>> LET ME SAY RIGHT AT THE

369
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,220
OUTSET, I BELIEVE DR. FORD.

370
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,788
I BELIEVE THE SURVIVOR HERE.

371
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:51,324
THERE'S EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE

372
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:51,591
HER.

373
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:54,761
SHE HAS COME FORWARD

374
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:55,395
COURAGEOUSLY AND BRAVELY.

375
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:56,362
>> I BELIEVE WITH HER AND I

376
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:59,199
STAND WITH HER.

377
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:01,467
>> SO IF SHE SHOWS UP ON

378
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:02,869
MONDAY -- >> I DON'T THINK SHE

379
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:04,737
SHOULD BE BULLIED INTO THE

380
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:07,373
SCENARIO, IT'S A SHAM HEARING

381
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:08,441
AND I DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD

382
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:08,942
PARTICIPATE IN IT.

383
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:10,810
>> I BELIEVE PROFESSOR FORD.

384
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,579
I THINK SHE'S CREDIBLE AND I

385
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:14,380
THINK WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS

386
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,784
FINISHED AND WHEN SHE TESTIFIES

387
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:18,952
AND WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH

388
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:20,353
TESTIFIES, I THINK A MAJORITY OF

389
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:21,955
SENATORS WILL FIND HER CREDIBLE.

390
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:26,893
AND I DON'T THINK -- I NEVER

391
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:29,162
THOUGHT JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD

392
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:29,629
GET APPOINTED.

393
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:31,731
>> NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

394
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:33,700
>> AT THE VERY SAME TIME, ALL

395
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,468
THE PEOPLE YOU ARE WATCHING

396
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:38,905
HERE, WE HAVE A CASE NOT 36 OR

397
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:41,741
SEVEN OR FIVE YEARS AGO, BUT

398
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,543
KEITH ELLISON, THE NUMBER TWO

399
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:46,146
GUY AT THE DNC HAS BEEN ACCUSED

400
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:48,715
OF REPEATED PHYSICAL AND

401
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:50,917
EMOTIONAL ABUSE AND THE DNC HAS

402
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:52,819
SMEARED AND SLANDERED AND

403
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,756
IGNORED THE PERSON MAKING THAT

404
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:56,156
ALLEGATION.

405
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:57,090
THAT WAS BACK IN AUGUST.

406
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,560
THIS YEAR.

407
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,762
SO WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING IS A

408
00:13:01,762 --> 00:13:06,900
DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLAYING

409
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,601
POLITICS, SADLY EXPLOITING A

410
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:12,573
CONDUCT ALLEGATION ACCUSATION,

411
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:15,742
THAT'S IT, FOR POLITICAL GAIN.

412
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:17,177
JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS AND

413
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:17,811
RUSHING TO JUDGMENT.

414
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:24,117
THESE ARE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS.

415
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:24,785
BUT TONIGHT EVERY AMERICAN,

416
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:26,687
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT,

417
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:28,355
CONSERVATIVE AND LIBERAL.

418
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:29,590
THIS IS WHY YOU NEED A HEALTHY

419
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:35,262
DOSE OF SKEPTICISM.

420
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:36,363
LET ME TELL YOU WHY.

421
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:37,965
DEBORAH KATZ HAS VIEWS ON

422
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:40,167
SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT HAVE BEEN

423
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:40,968
EXTRAORDINARY POLITICAL AND

424
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:42,336
INCONSISTENT AT BEST.

425
00:13:42,336 --> 00:13:44,671
FOR EXAMPLE, SHE SAID THIS ABOUT

426
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:45,706
PAULA JONES.

427
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:48,142
NOBODY IN THE MEDIA REPORTS IT.

428
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:51,312
PAULA JONES' SUIT IS VERY, VERY

429
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:55,082
WEAK AND, NOT BY HER OWN

430
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:57,551
TESTIMONY HAD LASTED TEN OR

431
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:57,952
12 MINUTES.

432
00:13:57,952 --> 00:13:59,820
SHE SUFFERED NO REPERCUSSIONS IN

433
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,588
THE WORKPLACE.

434
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:03,290
SHE SAID, CLEARLY A ONE-TIME

435
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,594
INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE IN

436
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:08,362
10-12 MINUTES, SHE LEFT OF HER

437
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:14,201
OWN VOLITION, AND THE COURTS ARE

438
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:16,637
FINDING THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO

439
00:14:16,637 --> 00:14:17,972
CREATE A HOSTILE WORK

440
00:14:17,972 --> 00:14:19,173
ENVIRONMENT CLAIM.

441
00:14:19,173 --> 00:14:21,775
SHE ALSO SET OF CREEPY

442
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:22,676
SENATOR AL FRANKEN "CONTEXT IS

443
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:23,177
RELEVANT.

444
00:14:23,177 --> 00:14:25,412
HE DID NOT DO THIS AS A MEMBER

445
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:27,982
THE U.S. SENATE."

446
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:28,382
YES HE DID.

447
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:29,550
AND BY THE WAY HE DID THIS IN

448
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,619
THE CAPACITY OF SOMEONE WHO IS

449
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:35,356
STILL FUNCTIONING AS AN

450
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:36,123
ENTERTAINER.

451
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,224
CLEARLY, PROFESSOR FORD'S

452
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:39,626
ATTORNEY HAS A LEFT-WING RADICAL

453
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:42,596
INCONSISTENT POLITICAL AGENDA,

454
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:43,263
AND "THE DAILY CALLER" EVEN

455
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:49,336
UNCOVERED BACK IN 2017.

456
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:51,438
AND WE HAVE THE TAPE.

457
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:52,940
HERE IT IS.

458
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,642
>> FINALLY OVER THE FINISH LINE

459
00:14:54,642 --> 00:14:57,378
COME UP WITH A GENERAL GRATEFUL

460
00:14:57,378 --> 00:15:01,048
TO THE COLLEAGUES WHO WENT FOR

461
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:01,315
HIM.

462
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:04,085
>> I CAN'T APPRECIATE, EXPRESS

463
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:05,019
HOW APPRECIATIVE I AM FOR THOSE

464
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:06,353
OF YOU WHO STOOD BY ME DURING

465
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:08,923
THESE DIFFICULT TIMES.

466
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:12,460
>> IT WAS A A BITTER FEUD TO THE

467
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,962
VERY END.

468
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:17,765
>> GOING TO FIGHT BACK, GOING TO

469
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:18,099
RESIST.

470
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:19,066
WE ARE ALSO LEARNING THAT

471
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:21,769
PROFESSOR FORD IS ADDING ANOTHER

472
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:24,839
PERSON TO HIS LEGAL TEAM, AN

473
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,775
ATTORNEY NAMED MICHAEL BROMWICH.

474
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:29,944
HE'S THE LAWYER REPRESENTING

475
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:30,745
FIRED FBI DIRECTOR ANDREW

476
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:31,078
McCABE.

477
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:34,448
THIS BRINGS US TO OUR HANNITY

478
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,350
HISTORY LESSON SURROUNDING THE

479
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,253
DEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK.

480
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:47,061
EVERY ELECTION CYCLE, AND THEY

481
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:48,162
ARE LITERALLY NAMING THE

482
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:49,363
CHARACTER OF THE POLITICAL

483
00:15:49,363 --> 00:15:51,365
OPPONENTS, EVEN IF IT MEANS

484
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:53,367
LYING IN THE PROCESS.

485
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:54,101
THEY DEMONIZE ALL CONSERVATIVES.

486
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:55,035
THERE'S NOT A CONSERVATIVE THAT

487
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:57,438
I KNOW THAT HAS NOT BEEN THROUGH

488
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:57,738
THIS.

489
00:15:57,738 --> 00:16:00,841
IN FACT EVERY FOUR YEARS, EVERY

490
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:02,243
TWO YEARS, REPUBLICANS ARE

491
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:06,347
RACIST, MISOGYNISTIC,

492
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:07,949
HOMOPHOBIC, ISLAMOPHOBIC.

493
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:09,350
THEY WANT DIRTY AIR AND WATER,

494
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,484
THEY WANT TO KILL YOUR CHILDREN

495
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:12,354
AND THROW GRANNY OVER A CLIFF.

496
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:15,557
THE LEFT HAS ALSO RUSHED TO

497
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,193
JUDGMENT IN THE WAKE OF OTHER

498
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:18,627
MAJOR EVENTS.

499
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:20,562
THEY HAVE BEEN WRONG.

500
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,197
ON THIS PROGRAM THEY'VE BEEN

501
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:22,497
RIGHT.

502
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:24,666
WE DIDN'T RUSH TO JUDGMENT IN

503
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:30,105
THE DUKE LACROSSE CASE.

504
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:31,506
REMEMBER THE SUMMER OLYMPICS AND

505
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:31,840
BOMBING?

506
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,342
REMEMBER BECAUSE HE SAID HE FIT

507
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:36,278
THE PROFILE OF A LOAN BOMBER,

508
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:39,047
BECAUSE HE LIVED WITH HIS MOTHE

509
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:39,381
MOTHER.

510
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:40,248
RICHARD JULES LISTENING TO MY

511
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:42,784
RADIO SHOW WAS A LOCALHOST IN

512
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:43,718
ATLANTA AT THE TIME.

513
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:46,188
HE MUST THINK ME FOR BEING THE

514
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:50,025
ONLY ONE NOT TO RUSH TO JUDGMEN

515
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:50,392
JUDGMENT.

516
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:52,994
REMEMBER THE RUSH TO JUDGMENT IN

517
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:55,163
BALTIMORE, WITH FREDDIE GRAY?

518
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:57,532
NEVER WHEN OBAMA SAID THE

519
00:16:57,532 --> 00:17:00,735
CAMBRIDGE BELIEF ACTED STUPIDLY?

520
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:03,138
WE HAVE ON THIS PROGRAM ADOPTED

521
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:06,340
THE "WE WILL NOT RUSH TO

522
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:06,708
JUDGMENT.

523
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,144
WE WILL WAIT AND WE WILL SEE."

524
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:10,579
ON THE DUKE LACROSSE KIDS I WENT

525
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,781
TO MEET WITH THEIR PARENTS AND I

526
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,148
MET WAS GEORGE ZIMMERMAN'S

527
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:15,517
ATTORNEY AND THAT GEORGE

528
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:16,651
ZIMMERMAN AND ASKED HIM TOUGH

529
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:17,185
QUESTIONS.

530
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:18,819
YOU SEE HAD NOW COME EVERY TIME

531
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:23,325
THERE IS A SUPREME COURT

532
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:23,959
NOMINEE, AND THAT'S THE

533
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,296
REPUBLICAN APPOINTS HIM.

534
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:32,500
WE WE SOUGHT JUDGE BORK, AND

535
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,101
MITT ROMNEY WAS SEXIST.

536
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:37,072
HE HAD BINDERS FULL OF WOMEN'S

537
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:37,405
RESUMES.

538
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:39,074
REMEMBER THEY TURN HIS EFFORTS

539
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:40,275
TO HIRE WOMEN INTO AN ATTACK

540
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:43,912
ABOUT HIM BEING SEXIST.

541
00:17:43,912 --> 00:17:46,181
MITT ROMNEY WAS NOT.

542
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:46,815
WHENEVER THEY HAD FALSELY

543
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:51,386
ACCUSED HIM, REMEMBER HARRY REI

544
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:53,222
HARRY REID, AND HE HAD NO REAL

545
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:56,592
REGRETS ABOUT SPENDING THOSE

546
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,360
LIES AND FALSE ATTACKS.

547
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,863
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

548
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:02,030
THIS IS WHY AMERICAN DUTIES HAVE

549
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,400
A DUTY TO SKEPTICAL.

550
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,237
WE SEE IT EVERY TWO YEARS, EVERY

551
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:08,971
FOUR YEARS, EVERY SUPREME COURT

552
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:11,774
NOMINEE AND EVERY BIG

553
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:12,741
HIGH-PROFILE CASE THAT THEY

554
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:13,976
POLITICIZE.

555
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:15,377
HERE'S A LOOK AT HAIRY REDA.

556
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:17,446
>> LET HIM PROVE THAT HE HAS

557
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:18,781
PAID TAXES, BECAUSE HE HASN'T.

558
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:23,352
I DON'T REGRET THAT AT ALL.

559
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,586
NO ONE WOULD HELP ME, SO I DID

560
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:26,188
IT ON MY OWN.

561
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,558
>> NO REGRETS ABOUT ROMNEY OR

562
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:37,232
THE COAT BROTHERS.

563
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:41,003
>> I REGRET TELLING A TOTAL LIE

564
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:41,570
AND SMEARING SOMEBODY.

565
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:46,842
FROM MITT ROMNEY TO ROBERT BORK

566
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:48,443
TO CLARENCE THOMAS TO

567
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:52,781
GEORGE BUSH, FRANKLY EVERY A

568
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:55,517
CONSERVATIVE I KNOW, I WAS BEEN

569
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:56,785
FORCED TO DEAL WITH THEIR LIFE

570
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:58,987
AND SOME OF THESE BASELESS

571
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:01,023
CHARACTER SMEARS AND CHARACTER

572
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:02,825
ASSASSINATIONS.

573
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,793
THAT IS TO CALL REPUBLICANS

574
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:07,429
RACIST AND IT HAPPENS EVERY

575
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:09,765
REPUBLICAN SEASON.

576
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:11,366
>> MANY REPUBLICANS TALK IN

577
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,769
CODED RACIAL LANGUAGE ABOUT

578
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:14,570
TAKERS AND LOSERS.

579
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,139
THEY DEMONIZE AT PRESIDENT OBAMA

580
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:19,174
AND ENCOURAGE THE UGLIEST

581
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:21,744
IMPULSES OF THE PARANOID FRENCH.

582
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:26,415
>> YOU EXPECT THE SUPPORT OF

583
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:23,011
PRESIDENT  , YOU WILL ACCEPT THE

584
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:30,185
CLAN SYMPATHIZERS BEFORE YOU ARE

585
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:31,420
PRESIDENT  , YOU WILL ACCEPT THR

586
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,154
SUPPORT AFTER THEY ARE

587
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:32,521
PRESIDENT?

588
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:33,822
>> HE WILL LET THEM WRITE THEIR

589
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:38,127
OWN RULES.

590
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:40,562
UNCHAINED WALL STREET.

591
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:42,498
THEY WILL PUT YOU ALL BACK IN

592
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:42,831
CHAINS.

593
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:45,401
>> IT'S WRONG WHAT THE LEADER OF

594
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:46,235
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THIS

595
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:49,171
CONGRESS ARE DOING AND BLOCKING

596
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,306
AN ACCURATE CENSUS BECAUSE THEY

597
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,841
DON'T WANT TO COUNT EVERYONE

598
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:55,244
THAT THEY DON'T THINK THEY CAN

599
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:55,644
COUNT ON.

600
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:57,546
>> THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF

601
00:19:57,546 --> 00:20:00,783
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, IF YOU CAN

602
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,219
DUNK THE BASKETBALL OR A SINK A

603
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:03,953
THREE-POINT SHOT.

604
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,621
BUT THEY ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF IT

605
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,889
IF YOU MERELY HAVE THE POTENTIAL

606
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,158
TO BE A LEADER IN YOUR COMMUNITY

607
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:11,594
AND BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.

608
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:13,363
DON'T TELL ME WE HAVE A

609
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:15,865
COLOR-BLIND SOCIETY.

610
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:25,175
>> 2-7, WHEN

611
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:25,975
GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH REFUSED

612
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:26,976
TO SUPPORT HATE CRIMES

613
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,945
LEGISLATION, IT WAS LIKE MY

614
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:30,547
FATHER WAS KILLED ALL OVER

615
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:30,847
AGAIN.

616
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:35,318
>> WHEN YOU DON'T VOTE, YOU LET

617
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:35,919
ANOTHER CHURCH EXPLODE.

618
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,422
WHEN YOU DON'T VOTE, YOU ALLOW

619
00:20:39,422 --> 00:20:44,294
ANOTHER CROSS TO BURN.

620
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:48,465
>> REAL SMEARS, REAL CHARACTER

621
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:50,200
ASSASSINATION, AND IT HAPPENS

622
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,167
PREDICTABLY EVERY ELECTION

623
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,102
SEASON AND IT HAPPENS WITH

624
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:55,405
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES.

625
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:57,974
THIS IS A GUTTER POLITICS AT ITS

626
00:20:57,974 --> 00:20:59,309
WORST AND SADLY, WE ARE GOING TO

627
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:00,710
SEE MORE AND MORE OF THESE

628
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,314
TACTICS AS WE NOW MARCH 43 DAYS

629
00:21:04,314 --> 00:21:05,615
OR SO TOWARDS THE MIDTERMS.

630
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:07,250
WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE ON THIS

631
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,285
IN A MOMENT, BUT FIRST BREAKING

632
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:11,621
TODAY IT ALSO APPEARS THAT THE

633
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:13,189
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD

634
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,392
ROSENSTEIN IS HANGING ONTO HIS

635
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:16,393
JOB, AT LEAST FOR NOW.

636
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:19,362
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" ISSUED ON

637
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,330
REPORT ACCUSING ROD ROSENSTEIN,

638
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,601
AND THEY ARE STICKING BY IT, OF

639
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:26,169
PLOTTING TO RALLY CABINET

640
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,204
OFFICIALS AND INVOKED THE 25TH
