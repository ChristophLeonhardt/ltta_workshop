ANOTHER STATE SUPREME COURT HAS
THANKFULLY STRUCK DOWN THE
EXTREMELY PARTISAN GERRYMANDERED
CONGRESSIONAL MAP.
HERE I AM TALKING ABOUT
PENNSYLVANIA.
THIS IS A MAP THAT THE STATE AND
POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE STATE
HAVE BEEN SUFFERING UNDER
FOR SOME TIME.
IT IS IN A STATE WHERE YOU HAVE
BASICALLY SPLIT IN TERMS OF THE
VOTE, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY
OF THE SEATS ENDED UP GOING TO
REPUBLICANS BECAUSE THEY HAVE
PUT INTO EFFECT AN EXTREMELY
PARTISAN MAP.
THANKFULLY IT LOOKS LIKE FOR
THIS YEAR'S ELECTIONS WE WILL
HAVE STILL BIASED CONGRESSIONAL
DISTRICTS BUT HOPEFULLY A LITTLE
BIT MORE EQUITABLE AND
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ACTUAL
VOTE IN PENNSYLVANIA.
>>PENNSYLVANIA WAS CONSIDERED
THE WORST GERRYMANDERED STATE
IN THE COUNTRY.
THEY HAVE A DISTRICT THAT LOOK
SO RIDICULOUS IT IS CALLED GOOFY
KICKING DONALD DUCK.
IT IS 
A TERRIBLE IDEA FOR
DEMOCRACY EITHER WAY.
REPUBLICANS OF COURSE DO
IT MORE.
SO THEY GATHER UP ALL THE
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS IN DISTRICTS
SO THAT WHOEVER THE INCUMBENT IS
THEY WILL NEVER LOSE.
THEY HAVE A GIANT LEAD IN
THOSE DISTRICTS.
THAT IS WHY SOMETIMES DEMOCRATIC
INCUMBENTS DON'T MIND.
SO THEY HAVE THESE HUGE MARGINS
AND THE OTHER SEATS 単
THAT IS WHERE THEY HAVE TO DRAW
THEM UP IN CRAZY WAYS.
THEY WILL TAKE A SLICE OF
PITTSBURGH THIS WAY AND A SLICE
OF PHILLY THAT WAY AND THEY WILL
MAKE IT SO THAT MOST OF THE
DISTRICTS ARE REPUBLICAN AND ALL
THE OTHER DEMOCRATIC VOTERS ARE
STUFFED INTO THE FEW DEMOCRATIC
DISTRICTS HENCE IN 2012
DEMOCRATS GOT MORE HOUSEBOATS
THAN REPUBLICANS DID IN THE
STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.
IN A DEMOCRACY THEY WOULD HAVE
MORE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN IN
PENNSYLVANIA BECAUSE HE
GOT MORE VOTES.
THEY SLICE THE DISTRICTS IN SUCH
A WAY THAT NONETHELESS
REPUBLICANS WON 13 OF THE
18 SEATS.
EVEN THOUGH THEY GOT LESS VOTES
THEY GOT 13 OUT OF THE 18 SEATS.
THAT IS WHY IT IS AS THE COURT
SAID IT CLEANLY AND PALPABLY
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
THEY ARE TAKING AWAY ONE
PERSON ONE VOTE.
>>AND THAT IS WHY THE STATE
SUDDENLY BOTH IN A WAY THAT IS
NOT IN THE INTEREST OF ITS
ACTUAL CONSTITUENCY.
AND WHEN YOU EXTEND THIS OUT
OVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THIS
IS WHY DEMOCRATS WILL GET MORE
VOTES IN THE GENERAL ELECTION
FOR SENATE, HOUSE, AND FOR
THE PRESIDENCY.
AND THEN THEY WILL NOT HAVE
CONTROL OF ANY OF THOSE THINGS.
IS BELIEVED THAT THE SUPREME
COURT WILL NOT STEP IN BECAUSE
THIS IS JUST A STATE THING,
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW.
WE RECENTLY REPORTED ON
NORTH CAROLINA.
NORTH CAROLINA ALSO THE SUPREME
COURT SAID THIS IS A
GERRYMANDERED PARTISAN BIASED
CONGRESSIONAL MAP, YOU DO
ANYONE BEFORE THE ELECTION.
THEN THE SUPREME COURT PUT
A HOLD ON IT.
NOW THERE IS ANOTHER PANEL OF
JUDGES SAYING IN FACT YOU WILL
HAVE TO DO IT, BUT THAT IS
BEING CHALLENGED.
YOU CAN'T JUST EXPECT THAT
BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT JUDGE
単 LOOK AT HOW NORTH CAROLINA,
REPUBLICANS ARE DEALING WITH A
LITTLE BIT OF A SETBACK THERE.
THE NORTH CAROLINA SUPREME COURT
WENT FOR THREE ROUGHLY LIBERAL.
AFTER THAT SWITCH THE
REPUBLICANS DECIDED L IF THEY'RE
GOING TO STOP US FROM
GERRYMANDERING THE CONGRESSIONAL
DISTRICTS WE GERRYMANDER THE
JUDICIAL DISTRICTS SO THEY HAVE
BEEN CHANGING THE JUDICIAL
DISTRICTS TO TRY TO REELECT
REPUBLICAN JUDGES TO STRIKE DOWN
THE GERRYMANDERING THEY ALSO
CHANGE JUDICIAL ELECTIONS FROM
NONPARTISAN TO PARTISAN.
YOU HAVE TO SAY WHAT
PARTY YOU ARE IN.
THE IDEA IS THAT THEY WILL NOT
WANT TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATIC
JUDGE THERE.
THEY ALSO CANCELED PRIMARIES IN
JUDICIAL DISTRICTS HOPING THAT
THE REPUBLICAN INCUMBENTS WOULD
THEN HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.
AND THEY ALSO STOP A NEW
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR FROM
ADDING THREE NEW JUDGES TO THE
COURT OF APPEALS.
SO THE LENGTHS THEY WILL GO TO
TO MANIPULATE THE VOTE AND
PERVERT DEMOCRACY ALMOST
NO NO BOUNDS.
>>WE ARE ENDING ON A FUN FACT 単
EVEN REAL CLEAR POLITICS WHICH
LEANS REPUBLICAN CALLED
PENNSYLVANIA THE GERRYMANDER OF
THE DECADE.
FUN FACT IS NOW WHEN THEY REDRAW
THE LINES TO INCUMBENTS WILL
LIKELY BE IN THE SAME DISTRICT.
IT WILL BE TO REPUBLICANS IN THE
CASE OF PENNSYLVANIA, THIS
HAPPENED IN OHIO WITH TWO
DEMOCRATS.
WHEN THEY REDRAW THE LINES NOW
THERE WILL BE A BUNCH OF
REPUBLICANS GOING AGAINST EACH
OTHER WHICH WILL BE AWESOME.
AND FINALLY THE FUND CONCLUSION
単
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A
HOUSE OF CARDS.
THEY LOSE THE ELECTIONS IN
POPULAR VOTES ALL THE TIME
INCLUDING ELECTIONS LIKE TRUMP
IN GEORGE W. BUSH'S FIRST
ELECTION WHERE THEY WHEN THE
ELECTORAL COLLEGE, KIND OF,
BUT THEY LOST THE ELECTORAL
VOTE.
BUT WITH THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY
AND POLITICS, AN AGING
POPULATION WITH THEIR ONE LAST
GASP OF ANGER, AND ALL THE
GERRYMANDERING THEY BARELY
CLUNG ON TO POWER.
ONCE YOU START KNOCKING DOWN A
COUPLE OF THOSE PEGS THEY ARE
IN FOR A WORLD OF HURT.
THAT COLLAPSE IS GOING
TO BE EPIC.
