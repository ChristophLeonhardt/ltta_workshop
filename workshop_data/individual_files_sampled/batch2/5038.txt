i'm steve cracking in for brian williams day 589 of the trump administration president Trump is heading into this Labor Day weekend and ending his summer after another very rocky week he began it by pointedly not participating in the nation's tributes to the late Senator John McCain who of course had been a frequent Trump critic Monday there was Trump's reported resistance to putting out a statement prepared by the White House after the Senators death over the weekend and for several hours on Monday no public comment mr. president too many faults on John McCain to have any thoughts at all about John McCain to to bleep John McCain was a hero sir nothing at all about John McCain the President did eventually note McCain's legacy during a speech to evangelical leaders but by that time he had already come under fire for raising the flag over the White House to full staff less than 48 hours after the Senators death public outrage including from veterans groups then forced him to lower the flag back down to half-staff then on Tuesday there was this a Washington Post report the Trump was still actively trying to get rid of Attorney General Jeff Sessions note that report was about the president's latest efforts to oust the man who was his first campaign supporter in the Senate sessions of course recused himself from the Russia investigation a year and a half ago it is the move that ignited Trump's continuing attacks on sessions as with many Trump sessions stories this one has a multi-day arc on the day of that Post report Senator Lindsey Graham said this about the two men this relationship is beyond repair I think the president's lost confidence in Jeff Sessions then Politico posted a story saying Trump was personally lobbying Republican senators to pull their support for sessions as the nation's chief law enforcement officer and yesterday bloomberg reported that Trump had declared the Attorney General safe until at least the midterms in November so while sessions remains in his job the President did announce another exit from the West Wing this week a move made public in his preferred style on social media Trump writing on Twitter White House Counsel Don Magan will be leaving his position in the fall Magan reportedly was not told the announcement was coming just last week the New York Times reported that Magan has been a key witness in the Moller investigation giving some 30 hours of testimony that investigation has been the target of Trump's anger for several months now fueling attacks on the Special Counsel and federal law enforcement agencies at a rally in Indiana last night the President issued this threat but our Justice Department and our FBI have to start doing their job and doing it right and doing it now because people are angry what's happening is a disgrace and at some point I wanted to stay out but at some point if it doesn't straighten out properly I want them to do their job I will get involved and I'll get in there by half - disgraceful Trump also again took aim at the media making a point of linking the press to his political opponents these are just dishonest terrible people I'm telling you that today is Democrat Party is held hostage by left-wing haters angry mobs deep state radicals establishment cronies and their fake news allies we've got stories that are so big and the media doesn't pick them up we have stories that if that was about a Republican or a conservative it'd be front page of every newspaper and we have them and they just don't want to write them it's a dishonest group of people I will tell you that new poll numbers out today suggest the possibility of a significant downward shift in the president's support Trump's disapproval rating in this ABC News Washington Post survey is at an all-time high now at 60% in the ABC poll with a 36 percent approval ready now for now this is the only poll to show Trump's approval that low and so the question is is this poll in outlier or is it the start of a trend that couldn't come at a worse time for Republicans whose congressional majority of course is on the line just over two months from now with that let's bring in our leadoff panel for a Friday night you me shall cinder White House correspondent for Newshour on PBS can Thomas White House reporter for The Associated Press and and Alan NBC News national political reporter thanks to all of you for being with us Ken Thomas from the AAP let me start with the AAP and it's reporting this afternoon on Donald Trump's state of mind inside the White House writing the president is more volatile than ever creating new challenges for both his communication and legal teams Trump built his professional empire on a foundation of secrecy enforced by fixers lawyers hush payments and non-disclosure agreements seeing that world collapse around him in recent weeks has yielded intense frustration in the president who has angrily told confidants that he feels betrayed by a number of former allies I'm curious if this suggests that confidence the president we have seen him bring to every bit of his political career is that confidence in any way slipping because of recent events well it speaks to the concern that there that they have inside the White House about how they will be able to combat some of these issues that they see on the horizon we saw Don Magan leaving and that he's going to be leaving after the Cavanaugh confirmation is wrapped up he's played a very important role as White House Counsel the counsel's office is is is much smaller than it has been in the past there's about 25 lawyers now and the administration is looking ahead if if there is a widespread turn of events in Congress where Democrats suddenly control the house they're gonna have to deal with a lot of incoming and I think the president is is seeing that on the horizon and it's it's concerning to him we mentioned that ABC news/washington post poll puts Trump at 36% the president at this hour in the last hour tweeting about it I can put this up on the screen he says the ABC Washington Post poll was by far the least accurate one two weeks out from election 2016 I call it a suppression poll but by Election Day they brought us out of shame too about even they will never learn you me say I guess I wonder about this to the president tweeting about a poll that he's trying to cast doubt on it but a poll here that certainly on its face does not bring good news to him that does seem a little bit unusual there are you too acting any new concern by Trump or the folks around him when it comes to his political standing at this moment I think that there's a there's really two sets of people that are looking at this if you're a Republican who is a supporter of President Trump you are almost getting more ingrained in your support for him and when I was out in West Virginia at one of his recent rallies people said that they felt as though he was really under siege and that the Justice Department and all these investigations were really just aimed at trying to get rid of a president that a lot of people didn't want to be there but of course if you're a Democrat looking at all this or if you're an independent American or if you're or if you're a Republican who just didn't support Donald Trump you're looking at this and saying there are all these different things going on there are people that are very close to the president who are being found guilty or who are pleading guilty to crimes you have Michael Cohen's lawyer saying that President Trump is a essentially an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal crime so people are more and more concerned and because of that that you see them losing even more confidence I will say though that polls were notoriously questionable in 2016 people say that that that really gave people the false confidence especially the people that were supporting Hillary Clinton they kept pointing to the polls saying well the polls say that Hillary Clinton is going to be in a pretty good position even if the polls show that they was close they still showed that Hillary Clinton was likely going to be able to win this race so of course now you have President Trump saying well these polls told you that I was going to be President and they were wrong well that's the issue or one of the issues at least John if you think back to the polling in 2016 there were so many of those moments when Donald Trump a I think most famously I think of the access how they would tape a few weeks before the election when there was a story out there a development a twist that you would look at it and you'd say there is no politician on earth who could recover from this and even if you got an initial indication that Trump's numbers were cratering they seem to return to baseline pretty quickly I'm looking at these this new polling from ABC News and I'm wondering if there has been a hit here sustained by Donald Trump because of manna fort because of Qom because of these things sort of all congealing at once here do you think this is what we saw in 16 three weeks from now we're back to baseline or do you think this is something that has more legs and we will have to wait to see number one what future polls indicate also how these stories develop I can tell you this I talk it to to folks who are involved in House Republican campaign strategy and they've been expecting that there would be a dip in the polls following in particular the Michael Cohen guilty plea you know their view is that things will revert to a mean fairly soon and that that's been the sort of history of this I think they're probably generally right about that but even if this poll was off Steve even if it's off five points president Trump's at forty one percent and fifty five percent disapproved that's a disaster for Republicans heading into the midterms I mean what we've seen over and over and over again is this president can't get above water in approval ratings what we've seen is a hardening as you Misha was talking about his basis is hard and and fast and tied pretty tightly to him but there are significant number of people on the other side who have been so alienated by him that they're gonna show up to the polls and vote against whoever's gotten or next to their name hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching
