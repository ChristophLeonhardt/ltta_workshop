I am only okay and you're in the stream today will Hollywood ever really properly represent Muslims it's no secret that stereotypes and tropes have dominated US popular culture for decades our times changing though a lot to discuss today and we want to hear from you so join a live conversation on YouTube so what do we have we have the angry terrorists the bumbling Shaikh the sultry belly dancer the good Muslim versus the bad Muslim so without a doubt all stereotypes that you've seen in your favorite Hollywood film or television program according to a new report huck and hollywood illuminating 100 years of muslim tropes and how to transform them this representation has fueled anti-muslim sentiment and even shaped government policies Huk is the arabic and odoo word for reality things are beginning to change though on-screen behind the camera and in the writers room so this is Zico Zaki he's an Egyptian American currently starring in the CBS drama FBI he sent the stream his thoughts on being a Muslim American in Hollywood it comes down to representation and in film or television you're either perpetuating a stereotype or fighting against it and you know as an artist both things are equally as important when it comes to the work but of course fighting these stereotypes is something that we all are excited to get involved in so I'm very excited and I think that Hollywood is now starting to use Muslims and Arab Americans to tell the stories of the good guys and that's only gonna help us as a nation come closer hopefully as a world and we can only do what we can do so if I can make a few people around this world that didn't care for Arab Americans or Muslims before if they can start to care about them now and just relate and find a friendly face in US and things like that you know the minimum effective dose and just to start the conversation and start the ball rolling in the right direction so I'm hoping to represent us well and you know that's kind of what drives me every day so we'll see how it goes and wish me luck good luck joining us from Los Angeles is the author of the report Hut and Hollywood Mesa al-hassan she's a senior fellow at pop culture collab that's a group pushing to accurately portray the stories and cultural realities of people of color salaam al Mariotti is the executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council Amina Baqir abdul-jabbar is a filmmaker and professor at California State University Ana Zeta ganas odda is an actress and advocate she's also founder of the Mena arts advocacy coalition an organization built to speak out for Middle Eastern North African performers rights and visibility it's good to have you here everybody may I I'm just wondering hello hello good to see you I'm calling this the new face of Hollywood welcome Hollywood nice to see you may I'm just thinking if it feels to me like it a no brainer why would you have to write a report about the lack of representation of Muslim faces or our faces on TV and Hollywood movies obvious it it is obvious when we look at the landscape right now but I want it to hit at the heart of how entrenched those images are and the narratives that are fueling them so that we could properly eradicate the consistent place we see ourselves in which is more and more stories about terrorism more and more stories about the shake and the bumbling fool more and more stories of women being misrepresented so this report takes a 100-year history to figure out how we ended up here with policies like the Muslim ban and it's not just simply a post 9/11 moment of Terror genre films I mean we saw a whole crop of them in the 1980s and 1970s in response to US foreign policy in the Middle East and concurrently as the report goes into there are as Amin does an amazing job speaking to black Muslims who are portrayed in really derogatory ways by the American public but black filmmakers fight back with really differing portrayals whole portrayals and so this long history is essential for us to understand not only how we got here but how we don't repeat our mistakes and also I highlight the really interesting work that Muslim creatives are doing in this moment and how they're pushing back against this narrative and lastly and there's an interview with Rami Yusuf who has a show on Hulu coming out in the next season then 2019 season but I end with recommendations so how can we break this cycle and the report talks about how we find ourselves in this place over and over again and how we can use community members to disrupt it I have a theory that sometimes people don't even realize that they're seeing a trope or a stereotype it sort of goes over their head there was something that you pointed out which was from Aladdin a 1992 Disney cartoon which was a huge massive hit it was hilarious in many parts it was a popular cartoon but the opening sequence actually has some Islamophobia right embedded in the song the chirpy little song do you remember a little bit of the song man yeah sing it yes I mean I think anybody that grew up as a child with that representation especially if you grew up Arab in America you can never forget those lyrics so in the movie theaters on giant screens you heard they cut off your ear if they don't like your face it's barbaric but hey it's home and so because of the great organizing work that a DC anti-arab discrimination commit I mean anti-arab anti-discrimination committee apologies the work that they did also checks Shaheen the late media studies scholar pushing back against what Disney was doing they did get the lyric to be changed in the VHS release but now Disney is making a live-action remake of that film in 1992 and because of how they've had enough time to look at what that film has done the damage that is done they don't want to repeat those in the stage I mean what are you seeing right now where you're saying this is not representing me well I think that for me I'm black obviously and Muslim and I think that it goes back to what Malcolm used to talk about like the original discussion about black Muslims who were black in America and the definition that even being from Muslims who are black and I you know being called black Muslims so there's a way that even when you see representations of black Muslims or Muslims who are black they are not a part of the whole conversation of Muslims so we're sort of other din that and that is because I think the relationship that black people have in this country in terms of how we were you know brought over here in a transatlantic slave trade even the discussion about Islam in America and how when we think about the slaves and during antebellum South and the idea that there are actually Muslims who are practicing black Muslims were black practicing Islam but that is often left out of history books and certainly left out of the discussion of that in cinema so for me it's about sort of you know I take like the idea that I think about it as redefining what people expect in terms of what it means to be Muslim and I'm Muslim who had who was black but who's very American right so I think about the Muslim ban and how that ban is also a ban of the African countries as well but the face of the Muslim ban doesn't seem to have that so meaning Sabina for instance you're not coming to America to be a terrorist or you're not coming as an immigrant because you live in America and black is armed goes back many many years you may be mentioned Matt Walker Malcolm X well it predates even Malcolm X exactly you know el-hajj Malik Shabazz if you didn't you know it's from the very beginning when black people come to this soil and I would argue that you know we get left out of that conversation and where it's a monolith right so we don't think about Muslims who are black as being we only think of them as being in the Nation of Islam partially or mostly or we're even left out of the trope discussion because we actually can't hold that trope discussion for black bodies and Muslims I think I did this experiment where I asked people to close their eyes and that's a Black Muslim woman yes and I don't people are able to hold that right so there's a way we you think of usually a man you think like a bad man a bad black man right sure let me help us let me help people any anybody who watches the stream will be on a picture of Black Muslim American because my co-host is Malika Bulow so she's out there representing so yes go ahead yeah I think there's no doubt that Hollywood has been the has been guilty both religious and racial stereotypes of a lot of people and when it comes to Islam and Muslims the trope that is usually bandied about is that Islam is a foreign religion and so whether you are indigenous or immigrant whether you're African American or Arab American or Pakistani American I think we're all basically trying to we're all struggling with these stereotypes so there are many different paths that we are taking in terms of dealing with these Hollywood tropes and and also there's a great video that was done by a friend of mine Michael Singh called Valentino's ghost and it looks at the public opinion that was manufactured to support and foam foment anti-muslim and anti-arab policies in this in this country so it go it definitely gave facts at least 100 years if not longer that word is maybe just as easy to go ahead yeah something you know from a performer actually someone who's lived this for 15 years in the business navigated not doing those stereotypes and resisting and saying no to jobs that didn't feel right for me and a big part of what we've achieved in the last few years here in Hollywood that has changed is that you know we are fighting for recognized status because Muslim Americans which are mainly Middle Eastern North African South Asian Americans we count were counted as Caucasian in that space in casting categories so when representation and inclusion became very hip I was oftentimes asked if I was at Nick yeah and what does that mean you know what does ethnic mean it means did I check a box yeah so what was happening in the last five years is that the images were continuing to kind of default because we were being counted as Caucasian and they didn't have a place to put us and so just in this past August we have our own category now which is Mena Middle Eastern North African and so now there's a place to recognize status so I'm hoping that there's more of an uptick in roles like Zico got where you can actually have a hero Zico is a good-looking dude he could be our next Henry Golding and we need that kind of representation and we need more people to realize that with something like crazy rich Asians at the box office that having a diverse cast that isn't just some sort of a stereotype trope or a religious storyline that's something that's a human story that everyone can connect to is big at the box office let me go play on let me just play I I will be rare remiss of me if we do this whole conversation I don't squeeze in the clips so guess just to me a little bit of a pause heceta I want to play a little clip from Alpha alphas and it has a maja ally in it as well so people can see the kind of roles that you do accept and you will take have a look ask her if she has a boyfriend yet then she a little young for you excuse me never mind there's someone behind the glass we're out there who's there I know someone's there I can hear your heartbeat hi Rachel Derek Eric Latrobe I know him we brought him here two years ago Eric what are you doing so far so good - you are done I'm trying to conduct an investigation like a witch huh it's not a witch an opponent moves cruelty from one of the wings unless you're wrong and then you're turning friends into enemies no threat Isis eita in a miniseries called alphas Aziza what were you saying say that one more time I said yes le was threatening me what a beautiful black Muslim man my Hershel Holly who's marilla le now but so Ali and I had you know we got to play two well-rounded characters I played somebody who was from you know Central Asia and really represented the cultures and everything that went on in Afghanistan and Iran and we didn't really play into any story religious storylines we didn't plan to any of the stereotypes but we represented the culture I'm not something that I went to the creator's and we discussed together and so there is some responsibility on the performers to engage their storytellers and communicating for all of us as a community to connect together and say yeah we're not going to do that we're more than just this religious idea that you're painting on us we have rich traditions rich culture two cultures we come from 22 different countries in that region of the world and we represent a multitude of religions and so to be able to see us as more than just one thing is super important in order to change the perspective and you know we can't just you know if African Americans are so lucky because they have they have United they have unified each other's voices they amplify each other's work Chris Hart you know Chris Rock is amplifying Kevin Hart's opening movie weekend and we need to start doing that for one another in all of the species by amplifying the studies that are come so let me just want to share this with you this comes in live from YouTube by legend legendary says Hollywood makes movies that correlate with money they are not racist or discriminate they're just living up to people's stereotypical views of Islam discuss Salaam ya know it's the other way around it's the stereotypes that influence public opinion where there is a fear of Islam and I think that's the issue dehumanizes Muslims it dehumanizes people of color and and that is a problem you know for all of us not just Muslims and Arabs I want to say though that our approach in terms of dealing with this problem is engaging those mid-level professionals in the industry by consulting we also engage TV networks and production companies we do one-on-ones with with those industry professionals we do screenwriting labs we do networking events and so there are good people in Hollywood there are a lot of good people and and so our approach is to ally with the good people we also paint a stereotype of it so yeah and I was doing go ahead tonight we're hosts at Amara night actually tonight in New York and tomorrow night in in Los Angeles my Coalition is and with the casting Society of America we're hosting the first-ever Town Hall between the casting community and Middle Eastern North African South Asian communities to talk about the issues that we deal with when we're trying to get cast for a role that isn't necessarily stereotyped to one region of the world to try to have inspire some balance storytelling so that I can play the same role Kerry Washington plays and it doesn't have to be about my religion that it can just be that I'm a powerhouse attorney or whatever that might be and so we're starting to have these conversations this is we've gotten the ball rolling in that space so there is some progress because we're coming in and we're educating or inspiring or saying hey we are we are black Muslims you know we are Arab we are Afghan we have some of us are Christians there's many of us from this region of the world that have fair representation all right so no because I'm a festival and then Amira may you go you go first well um there there's a triangular relationship that's what I discuss in the report it's basically there there are political drivers that affect public opinion and Hollywood is somewhere responding in between those two things now it's not that they make a lot of money off of this you saw the whitewashing of gods and whatever that recreation of Moses story was that films in Egypt gods in Egypt bombs at the box office nobody wanted to see white folks continue to play characters from a region where we know there were people of color and also a TV series called the brave I think this idea in this moment Hollywood has this conception that okay we're gonna move beyond the bad terrorists and give you the good Muslim who is fighting on behalf of the state who is either a CIA agent or an FBI agent and we're gonna watch them catch the terrorists or catch the other bad guy who is not the Arab or not the Black Muslim and that hasn't panned well either the show the brave was cancelled after one season so it has done that audition you know I read that start they asked me to come in on one of the roles and I read the script and I said unless they want me to come and tell them what is so inherently wrong with the right so guess let me just bring in Abdullah Abdullah Al Nasr is on YouTube so he's on my laptop here increased representation in movies should help Western society further understand Islam Amina well I want to go back to the comment before I want to say that that was not to go away from this but just to make sure I hit that point then it's nonsensical to discuss the stereotypes as as being profitable when we know that people are smarter than that they want good stories they want authentic stories and it does us a disservice to accept stereotypes and there's no more does this become true than with the film Black Panther right so I don't think that you know when you look at Black Panther that film there's no that's that's a great example of a money-making machine and positive representations of blackness and there's no reason we can't have that with stories about Muslims I don't think anybody on this panel would disagree with that mm-hmm yeah and also I just wanted to say that we we've estimated that there are at least 800 projects for us to consult on that we're we're you know where where the impact Hollywood Bureau we have our recommendations that are also pretty much in line with may Hudson's report that you can find through our up ads we do 15 of these projects right now but there's more than enough work for all of us to get in there so that we can move the needle on these stereotypes and and I think really now what everybody should be involved I don't want to move the needle as a consultant I'm a filmmaker and a director and a writer and a producer so my what I want to put up as activism is when you are contacted to be consultants on this that you ask who is Muslim in the above-the-line positions right so the writing the producing the directing you know and so for me it's like I'm content creator I'm a director I've been doing this for over you know since 4 years since 2002 at least so I think some of that is when they come to you all you know push them to hire Muslim above the line well that's exactly do we'll do it do a better job that's me that's me that's another part of the conversation which I am a little newer to this world in terms of working within the industry I've studied film for and representations of Muslims for years and so it was illuminating to realize that the work of consultants sometimes takes away the seat from the writer in the room but there are larger structural problems in Hollywood where and how a writer person of color or somebody who is traditionally underrepresented in the writers room enters a room and usually is the token person is doesn't have any other allies in the room or sometimes a showrunner or producer will say I have a consultant so I don't need a writer so I take your point very strongly Amina and I also point to the other kind of interesting activism that's happening with Muslim creators you know we have our actors we have our writers but there are folks who are doing webseries and getting picked up there's one that just got picked up by a amazing production company called east of La Brea it was a project that was produced by Samir garde se who is a longtime screenwriter and also Muslim anti racism collaborative which was incredibly unique for a Muslim social justice organization to be involved in the production of a piece of Arts and let me see Anna Mae let me add one more to that list because this is some of Amenas work and Amina has worked on something called the MS limors guide to marriage I went to have a little look muslimah is one of the characters in the film have a look it was you cannot hide this divorce forever muslima soon as your dies over Candace's converting to Islam before we get married as long as I can keep Christmas I mean I'm just wondering do you think times have changed now where you can make a film director film be in the space and change the narrative you changing the narrative I definitely am I have a whole team of people behind me supporting me to do that now you know I feel like being here being on this show and seeing all the faces I want to first say thank you to the panel you know happy to see them because all of us need to do this to change it I feel like I'm at the beginning of that but I also think my father Donna back here who worked on the film whose book was turning to the film South Central they had a positive Muslim character ally in 1992 before Malcolm X came out I think I stand on those shoulders and I'm ready to change it so now I've got I've got 30 seconds left me I'm the villain in the film that's what they're doing sentence you have a second we need both we need both advocates and creatives to work on this together it's like the LGBTQ community works there's glad MPAC is like glad advocating and then we work with the creatives to promote them as well all right let me let me share this with you this is from Sahir Ali as I hear Ali just sent us this tweet the most authentic representations of Muslims in popular culture come from those which demonstrate an intimate knowledge of the communities intimacy means the storytellers have relationships with closeness and accountability to their subjects thank you so much so much more to talk about may Salam Amina azita we could do another show we will do another show we're not a One Show topic on this one in particular thank you for joining us and I will see you always online at our on Twitter at 8:00 a stream thanks for watching you
