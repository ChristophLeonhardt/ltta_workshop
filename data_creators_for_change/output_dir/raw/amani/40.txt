26
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">University for those who don't know that</font>

27
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,699
already I records the programming

28
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,670
Association hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> a concert every year</font>

29
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,250
using students money basically so like

30
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,750
for tuition they charge us extra

31
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,580
programming fees or whatever and then

32
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,320
without programming monies<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

33
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,880
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like huge free concert on</font>

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,260
campus and it was complain about it

35
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they're going to put our</font>

36
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,720
education money towards in concert<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey</font>

37
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,390
and our programming committees basically

38
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,820
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unique talent of always being</font>

39
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,470
able to pick off the artists right

40
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,210
before they blow<font color="#CCCCCC"> up so during</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

41
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,610
year's big sean was definitely hot I

42
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,990
think he<font color="#E5E5E5"> had like a few bangers right</font>

43
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,159
ever but he was like still on the

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,600
come-up right so this is like literally

45
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,880
right before<font color="#E5E5E5"> big sean like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hit like a</font>

46
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,590
different caliber for example my

47
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,560
freshman year they had j Cole before j

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,020

going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be all mainstream about j Cole</font>

54
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,270

55
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,470

56
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,409

still nothing comprised of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

82
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,140
confidence that big sean shuts down

83
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,270
these days but like at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time that was</font>

93
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,560

94
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,230
always operate on Arab timing so like

95
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,690
I'm late<font color="#CCCCCC"> to literally everything I've</font>

96
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,400

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,040
patience to wait for any damn body

102
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,830

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,299
happen to see a back entrance with

115
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,400
double doors wide open and someone

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,540
sitting at a table there with the

117
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,160
security or like secretary person

118
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,720

real nice walk straight towards the door

124
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,180
